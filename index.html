For years, the UK government has been cooking up legislation to more tightly regulate online spaces. Provisions in the Online Safety Bill include mandatory age-checks on porn sites and jail time for tech execs who withhold data from investigators. Now, these ambitious and controversial plans have been delayed, as the Conservative government faces a leadership election after the resignation of Boris Johnson as party leader.

Nintendo has acquired CG production company Dynamo Pictures, and will rename it to “Nintendo Pictures,” the company has announced. The new subsidiary will “focus on development of visual content utilizing Nintendo IP” and the “planning and production of visual content including CG animation.” The company’s IMDB page lists credits on dozens of titles, including motion capture work on Death Stranding and Persona 5, and post-production work on Metroid: Other M. 
The acquisition comes as Nintendo is gearing up for the most significant cinematic release in years; an animated movie based on the Super Mario Bros. franchise starring Chris Pratt. The film is currently scheduled to release in spring next year, almost thirty years after the last...

Welcome once again, friends, to the best tech deals Amazon Prime Day 2022 has to offer. It’s now the end of day two, and our Verge Deals team is just about done highlighting the deals and discounts that are actually worth a damn. Instead of trudging through Amazon’s annual garage sale of overstock items yourself, however, let us help you. 
There are definitely still some worthwhile discounts for those in the market for wireless earbuds, smart home tech, phones, TVs, games, and some other odds and ends. For example, the Beats Fit Pro are some of the best earbuds around and they’re $40 off, as is the unique Samsung M8 monitor / smart TV hybrid, which is on sale in green for $180 off.

The best phone prices undeniably come from wireless carriers — but they also come with a lot of strings attached, like lengthy contracts and requirements to stay on expensive unlimited plans. Buying unlocked means that you aren’t tied to a particular carrier or plan, and that’s why we recommend purchasing a phone that way if you can. Unfortunately, it also means missing out on the “free” phone offer.
While Amazon isn’t giving out any free phones on Prime Day, you’ll find the next best thing: significant discounts on current models, with no contract or trade-in required. Here you’ll find the very best wireless deals on Prime Day, from accessories to flagships to 4G-only phones, with no strings in sight.

                              <span>React Native (RN) allows us to write code in one language for mobile apps instead of resorting to writing platform specific code.  
However there are some things in RN that do require platform specific code. 
Below we have a custom button component, the effect we&#x27;re looking at now is the button changing color when pressed 👆🏾. 
RN gives us a special property we can use for this effect, it&#x27;s called android_ripple. Once the button is pressed, the ripple property applies the color we provided to the button.

JavaScript has been the only programming language that the browser understands. JavaScript has stood the test of time and it has been able to deliver the performance needed by most web applications. But when it comes to 3D games, VR, AR, and image editing apps, JavaScript is not quite up to the mark since it is interpreted. Although JavaScript engines such as Gecko and V8 have Just in Time compilation capabilities, JavaScript is not able to provide the high performance required by modern web applications.
WebAssembly(also known as wasm) is meant to solve this problem. WebAssembly is a virtual assembly language for the browser. When we say virtual, it means that it cannot be run natively …</span>

                              <span>Technology has grown much faster than everything else. All the technology is developed because of coding and programming.
So what&#x27;s the difference between coding and programming. 
Because computers do not understand human languages. Coding allows humans to communicate with the computer. Code instructs the computer which tasks to be performed and what things to do. Learning code also helps develop applications, websites AI tools and even Internet of Things(IOT) among others.
Coding is a process of establishing a successful communication between a software program and the computer hardware. The compilers translate the program into assembly language. The coding process converts the assembly language to Binary Coded Signals.
Programming is an act of designing and developing a logical software solution to the problem statement. It involves designing and developing the algorithms, flowcharts, and implementing the solution using a programming language.
Programming is a complex task. Unlike coding, programming is carried out in Stages. Following are the stages of programming a software application.
Problem Statement
Designing Algorithms and Flowcharts
Software Development
Software Documentation
Software Maintenance 
Coding uses traditional code/program editing tools like notepad, notepad++, Eclipse, and so on.
Programming tools are not confined to only editing a program. It involves interoperability between different software applications via data connectors. A software web application might have to store and manipulate data in a database and many more.

In Develop a smart contract, you developed a smart contract for storing and retrieving a single numeric value. This tutorial illustrates how you can extend the functionality of your smart contract to manage one number per user. To add this functionality, you&#x27;ll use the Mapping type.
the following code illustrates mapping a user to a number:
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct MyContract {
    // Store a mapping from AccountIds to a u32
    my_number_map: ink_storage::Mapping,
}

With the Mapping data type, you can store a unique instance of the s…</span>

                              <span>Have you ever tried to add an event listener to a group of html elements all at once? if you had, you may had probably done something like this:
const buttons &#x3D; document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;button&quot;);

buttons.forEach((item) &#x3D;&gt; {
  item.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function () {
    console.log(&quot;click&quot;);
  });
});

The problem with the above code is that, when you finally check your browser console, you are going to encounter an error. Why?
This is because we are treating our list of buttons as an array while it is not.
It may look like an array, but it is actually either an htmlCollection or a nodeList. Whenever you make use of methods that fetch multiple elements/nodes from the DOM, that method either returns an htmlCollection or a nodeList.
Methods that returns an htmlCollection include: document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName()
Methods that returns a nodeList include: document.querySelectorAll(), document.getElementsByName()
In order to fix this problem, all you need to do is convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array. This way you can make use of array methods on it, and also add your event listener.
You can use any method you prefer in order to convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array, but my favorite way of converting them into an array, is by making use of the spread operator.
const buttons &#x3D; document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;button&quot;);
const buttonsArray &#x3D; [...buttons];

buttonsArray.forEach((item) &#x3D;&gt; {
  item.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function () {
    console.log(&quot;click&quot;);
  });
});


Now when you go to your browser console, everything will work as it is supposed to.</span>

Recently I found a fun way to play Python, using Python to convert pictures into ASCII image, most of which are local programs, because I built an online version of Python before, so I tried to use the online version of Python to realize image-to-ASCII.
Online Python editor: https://lwebapp.com/en/python-playground
The basic idea of image-to-ASCII painting is
Use PIL to get the RGB color value of each pixel of the image
Then map the RGB color value to a string
Finally, just splicing the strings together, printing to the terminal or saving as text, you can see the ASCII image.
We are here for the convenience of demonstration, and use the print method to print characters uniformly.
Since we want to present on a web page, we can&#x27;t load the image locally, we choose to load the i…</span>

尝试在 TWRP 里面挂载 OTG U 盘来重刷系统，但是依然无法正常开机。
有想过直接格式化 data ，然后直接线刷，但是手机里的数据还是想保留下来。
请问各位有没有什么方法可以解决？感谢！</span>

使用 fdisk -l /dev/sda 显示，应该是逻辑扇区识别错误的问题。
在 ubuntu 下(x86 电脑)显示的扇区大小为:
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes, 此时能正常识别分区信息。

在 openwrt 下(我家云 arm)显示的扇区大小为:
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes, 此时无法识别分区信息。
在 openwrt 下使用: fdisk -b 512 /dev/sda 进行操作，然后 p 打印分区信息可以显示正常的信息。
应该就是逻辑分区大小的问题了， 这个应该怎么整呢，试过在我家云上格式化硬盘，插回 pc, pc 又识别不了(此时逻辑扇区和物理扇区大小为 4096/4096)</span>

起因，发现右侧车位经常这样停，就让物业通知他改改

然后他就丢纸巾到我们位置（ 2 月一次，我们自己捡起来丢了，其间他又靠边停，无视之，最近不知何故又丢）

于是再次找物业，说约出来聊聊吧，结果人家说在自己车位（他租的非小区人买的小区车位）不犯法（类似这个说法），要找去找警察。三天，物业无法解决
左侧司机位这样停不是给自己找麻烦么？黑人问号脸

如图所示，阿里云，同一代（ g7)同样规格的服务器，AMD 比 Intel 要便宜 10-20%。
在只跑一些 x64 架构下的应用，比如 nginx ，数据库，Web 应用。用 AMD 的会有什么坑吗，比如稳定性，CPU 性能差距，IO 差距啥的？
本人用的就是 AMD CPU 的笔记本，个人用起来当然不会有啥问题。但如果是服务器场景下肯定不能按照个人 PC 的思路来考虑。</span>

以下摘录自《深入理解 JVM 虚拟机》第三版
在 Java 语言中字段是无法重载的，两个字段的数据类型、修饰符不管是否相同，都必须使用不一样的名称，但是对于 Class 文件格式来讲，只要两个字段的描述符不是完全相同，那字段重名就是合法的。
弄不懂这是什么意思。为什么说 Class 文件格式里面可以字段重名？
如果 Java 语言本身不支持字段重名，那么 Java 文件编译出来的 Class 文件里面怎么可能有重名的字段呢？</span>

如题，和朋友一起打算折腾一个新项目，想名字已经想破脑袋了，故希望 v 友一起集思广益。
目前确定的产品类型是护肤类产品，帮助用户了解自己的皮肤状况，以及选择合适的护肤品。
如果您的建议被采纳或我从中得到灵感，我会给你一个小小的红包以示感谢 (200 元)。
大致要求如下:
希望整体感觉是偏中性化的 (因为目标用户内也会有男性，过于女性化的名字可能会造成第一印象的偏移)
希望可以便于记忆 or 顺口 (例如小红书，微信)
能和护肤产生一定的联想 (非强求。PS: 非美妆。例如 小白瓶 这种名称，由于大多数精华都是小瓶子的形式，所以可以自然的产生一定的联想)。
目前自己想出来的名称如下:
空瓶集 (这个名称是最喜欢的，顺口，且能产生一定联想，但是奈何已经被注册掉了)
30 毫升 (30ML ，精华液大多数会采用的容量，但是总感觉这个名称不太好)</span>

是这样的，我现在主力机已经转到 Linux 了，但是由于国内软件生态问题，偶尔还是不得不切回 Windows 。在 Linux 上尝试了一些虚拟机软件之后，发现体验都不理想，思来想去最后还是我入手了一个 Surface Go3 。之所以选择这一款，主要是因为它是目前市面上最小巧的 Windows 平板，而且是微软官方出品，质量信得过。
使用了几个月之后，我不得不说，Windows 平板才是真正的生产力工具。为什么呢，因为它的触屏体验实在太残废了。而正是因为这种残废，削弱了平板的娱乐属性，反而增强的它的办公属性。你不会像 iPad 那样整体抱着它滑来滑去，要么是刷剧要么是打游戏，你唯一能做的就是把它当作一个 PC 来使用，偶尔用触屏作为辅助功能。
我平时用这个平板聊天或者开视频会议都没什么大问题，然而一旦网页稍微多一点就很吃力了，这点比较难受，虽说 8G 的内存也够了，但毕竟用是奔腾处理器。
然后我看了下市面上的其他 Windows 平板，发现还说得过去的只剩下这三款：
Surface Pro —— 性价比太低了，而且太大
联想 YOGA Duet —— 还是太大太厚重了
华为 MateBook E —— 配置和大小可以，然而那个设计风格模仿 iPad 痕迹太重了，尤其是那个圆角屏幕，我看着真是太难受了，跟 Windows 本身的硬朗风格非常不搭，有种很撕裂的感觉
由此我还是希望厂商们多多投入 Windows 平板领域，让市场上有更多选择，这块前景还是不错的。虽说智能手机和 iPad 这类偏生活和娱乐的工具受众更高，但是市场也饱和的差不多了，办公和生产力这方面还是很值得继续探索的。</span>

房子情况介绍
1.房子位于中部省会旁边的市里，类似于北京和燕郊的关系，只不过有合并的可能
2.19 年购买，今年 7 月拿到的契税发票(满 2 时间的依据)，目前已经降价 10w 左右
3.我未来大概率(80%)以上不会居住，家人在同一个市里有其他房产
顾虑
1.如果现在卖，税费比较高，但是再放两年，多出的贷款利息也差不多是那个钱
2.个人是觉得应该卖，这几年深刻意识到口罩时期，现金流才是王道，但是家人不同意，觉得赔 20w(房价降幅+贷款利息)很难接受，我应该怎么说服家里人</span>

API 管理这个话题近些年听到的频次越来越多，这本质上是个 web 领域的发展有关，也和开发协作方式有关--前后端分离代替了全栈工程师 hold all 的局面，强调的更多的是 API 复用、分工和协作细化。
API 管理的重要性不言而喻，每家公司随着业务的发展，多多少少都会涉及到；从开源社区的产品到国内各类商业化产品，可以看到大家对于 API 管理是越来越重视的。
为什么需要管理 API
Little story
结合自身的开发经历，我们先讨论下，为什么需要管理 API
1 、在实习的时候是在一家小的游戏公司，人不多，一个产品；当时技术经理的安排是一个后端+一个前端的组合开发，大家都在一个办公室，接口 API 交付依赖的是“讲一声”；这种形式减少了接口定义、审核以及一些文档的编写，面向指定接口的一对一交付；其实这个过程很顺利，还可以培养同事之间的关系；直到有一天，我对接的前端同事离职了，来了一个新的伙伴，然后我们也刚好要产品升级；每当我改一个接口，前端同学或者测试同学就说，接口不行了。后来我也走了，换了新的后端，“口口相传” API 就断代了。

2 、第二个 case 是做一个 web 项目(应用元数据管理)，前后端分离的；我们是先定义有哪些接口，然后再定义参数、返回结果以及这个字段的含义；是面向文档交付的；每个接口开发完之后发布到测试环境，然后他去编写前端接口调用测试；这种耦合度非常高，前端的节奏受制于后端的节奏。

3 、前面两种面向的都是一个端，再到后来，开始做基础平台，面向的有 web 、app （安卓、IOS ），各种三方，我们使用了开源社区的 Yapi 做了私有化部署，能够基本满足日常的需求（也比较痛苦，后面会提到）。

API 管理带来的好处
从前一节的 case 来看，API 管理的过程是在逐步完善的，从以工程师视角管理到更规范化的…</span>

                              <span>massCode 是一个开源的代码片段管理器，使你能够涉足代码，提高生产力，并节省时间。




如果一个工具能让事情变得更快、更有效率，那对许多开发者来说就是救命稻草。

虽然有各种服务和平台试图使编码体验更快，但你仍然有其他几个选择可以考虑。

例如，代码片段管理器。使用代码片段管理器，你的目的是保存你想快速访问的代码片段。它更像是指定快捷方式，在你的程序中添加所需的代码。

这不是一个新的概念，但可用于这项工作的工具可能不完全是开源的。

幸运的是，我偶然发现了一个不错的项目，它为你提供了一个自由开源的片段管理器，即 massCode。

massCode：跨平台的开源片段管理器



massCode 是一个有用的代码片段管理器，具有一些基本功能。

它支持广泛的编程语言，还包括对 Markdown 的支持。你可以使用文件夹组织你的代码片段，添加标签等。

massCode 可用于 Linux、Windows 或 macOS。让我们来看看一些主要功能。

massCode 的特点



massCode 包括许多有用的功能。其中一些是：


多层次的文件夹结构

每个片段都可以存储在片段（标签）中

集成的编码编辑器 Ace

代码格式化或高亮显示

支持带预览的 Markdown

能够搜索片段

给你的代码段添加描述，以了解它的用途

各种深色/浅色主题可用

能够从 SnippetsLab 迁移

自动保存以帮助你保留你的工作

将其与云同步文件夹整合

支持 VSCode、Raycast 和 Alfred 的扩展


除了上述所有功能外，你还可以轻松地复制保存代码片段，只需点击一下。

对于自定义，你可以调整字体大小和系列、切换自动换行、高亮显示行、使用单引号或添加尾随命令，这要归功于 Prettier。

此外，一份片段可以有多个分片。因此，它使你有机会将其用于各种用例。

如前所述，你也可以通过改变同步文件夹的存储位置将其与你的任何云同步服务整合。



总的来说，它工作得很好，有一些局限性，比如缺乏将嵌套文件夹从 SnippetsLab 迁移到 masCode 的能力。

在 Linux 上安装 massCode

massCode 有 Snap 包，但不在 Snap 商店中。你可以直接下载该软件包，并使用以下命令来安装它：

sudo snap install --dangerous ~/Downloads/masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap


我们的一份故障排除指南可以帮助你了解 snap 的 dangerous 选项。

你可以通过其 官方网站 或 GitHub 发布区 下载 Windows/MacOS 版。

                              <span>这篇教程演示如何使用脚本命令来发送自己的桌面通知与提醒。




有时候，来自脚本的视觉回馈是很有用的。例如，当一个脚本或计划任务完成时，一个长期运行的构建任务失败时，或者当脚本执行中出现了紧急问题时。桌面应用程序可以通过弹出通知来做到这一点，但脚本也可以做到这一点！你可以使用脚本命令来给自己发送桌面通知与提醒。



下面的代码是在 Linux 上编写和测试的。它也可以在 macOS 上运行，只需花点功夫。请参见最后一节 提示与技巧。

从 Linux 终端发送通知

要从 Linux 终端发送通知，请使用 notify-send 命令。运行 which notify-send 命令来查看它是否在于你的系统中。如果没有，请使用包管理器来安装它。

在 Fedora 上，输入：

$ sudo dnf install notify-send


在基于 Debian 的发行版上，输入：

$ sudo apt install notify-send


几个简单的通知示例：

$ notify-send &quot;Dinner ready!&quot;
$ notify-send &quot;Tip of the Day&quot; &quot;How about a nap?&quot;


你可以用紧急程度、自定义图标等选项来自定义通知。过 man notify-send 了解更多。你也可以在通知正文中使用一小组 HTML 标记，以使消息有一个棒的视觉感受。最重要的是，URL 被呈现为可点击的。例如：

$ notify-send -u critical \
  &quot;Build failed!&quot; \
  &quot;There were 123 errors. Click here to see the results: http://buildserver/latest&quot;

从《代码大全》 到 StackOverflow 大师

后来，当我在北京找到第一份工作时，学会了 Perl 语言，编写了我的第一个 CGI 程序（互动网页），编程于是成为了我吃饭的本领。

上世纪末，互联网刚刚在国内兴起，人们编程时所能求助的外援，大多是各种语言手册、类库大全等书籍。这其中有一本著名的大部头被很多程序员置于案头，它就是《代码大全》，这本书里面提供了很多有用的、精妙的编程示例和技巧。往往在遇到编程难点时，程序员们可以“复制”书中的一些最佳实践来解决。



随着互联网的普及，逐渐出现了 Stack Overflow 之类的编程类问答网站。程序员们惊喜的发现，原来很多困扰自己的编程难题都可以在网上找到答案，且点赞数较高的代码示例比自己写的还要好。于是乎，很多“程序员”变成了“谷歌程序员”/“百度程序员”，搜索、复制，然后粘贴就好了。以至于，StackOverflow 在某年愚人节的 恶作剧 说，它将限制对其网站的免费访问，除非人们购买“钥匙”：一个带有“打开 Stack Overflow”、“复制”和“粘贴”的按钮的设备，算是对这种直接复制、粘贴的做法表达了一种冷幽默。最有趣的是，居然有热心网友联合键盘定制厂商，真将这块特别的键盘定制出来了，并以 29 美元出售。



程序员们是否越来越成为一种熟练工？

随着写的代码越来越多，这种有趣但有时候又很枯燥的重复工作，让我想过什么时候可以有个…</span>

There are many theories about why the C programming language has endured for as long as it has. Maybe it&#x27;s the austerity of its syntax or the simplicity of its vocabulary. Or maybe it&#x27;s that C is often seen as a utilitarian language, something that&#x27;s rugged and ready to be used as a building material for something that needs no platform because it&#x27;s going to be its own foundation. C is clearly a powerful language, and I think its longevity has a little something to do with the way it serves as a springboard for other popular technologies. Here are five of my favorite technologies that utilize and rely upon C, and how they can each help you learn more about C…</span>

喜悦
早上，终于收到了 OpenAI 的通知，漫长的排队后，我可以用 DALLE 了。

种草了多长时间？我都快忘了，哈哈。
查了一下，是 4 月 7 日申请的，今天 7 月 13，差不多 100 天吧 😂

激动的心，颤抖的手，赶紧点进去。
欢迎我的，是这样一个霸王条款：

这图片，严禁商用，更别提 NFT 了；而且 OpenAI 对于我创作出来的图片拥有所有权。你只对自己上传到系统的图片有所有权。但是，为了改进模型，人家可能还要用你上传的图片作为训练数据……
搁以前我的脾气，扭头走人。
但是这回不行，吸引力太大，哈哈。
尝试
我输入了这样一段描述文字：

a kung fu panda is fighting with a T-rex in the woods

然后模型开始工作。等候过程中，会有一些提示，帮你改进后续的内容输入方式。
例如这个：

进度条往后走，还有这样的提示：

几十秒钟之后，进度条到头儿。我看到了结果，一共 6 张图片。我一一点进去。
这张很不错：

这张也行：

最搞笑的，是这张：

你拿恐龙当玩具吗？
这是 6 张图片的全景。你更喜欢哪一张呢？

我正玩儿得不亦乐乎，儿子进来了。他刚放假，最近在和弟弟养小鸡。于是他出的题目是：

Two little boys, teasing two fluffy chicks

出来的结果，他不是很满意。

因为这俩小孩儿，明显是外国人嘛。于是我修改了一下描述：

Two little Asian boys, teasing two fluffy chicks

嗯，看起来好多了。

The solo exhibition on view at Unit London showcases vivid paintings by Belgian artist Kristof Santy that transform humble fare like a cheddar wedge or slice of watermelon into bright, gastronomic celebrations.
Often positioned against textured tile backdrops or striped wallpaper, the oil-based works tend to be either devoid of human life or portray figures in rigid stasis: a butcher stiffly lifts a broom in the shop doorway, a finger peels back a tin of fish with precision, and pans filled with sausages and other meats fry on a stovetop unsupervised.

A professional pet portraitist, Vogelsang mostly visits her subjects at their homes rather than bringing them to her Hildesheim studio. More</span>

0. 前言
可能有人会觉得，画箭头有什么好说的，不就一根线加两个头吗？其实箭头的绘制还是比较复杂的，其中也蕴含着很多绘制的小技巧。箭头本身有着很强的 示意功能 ,通常用于指示、标注、连接。各种不同的箭头端，再加上线型的不同，可以组合成一些固定连接语法，比如 UML 中的类图。

一个箭头，其核心数据是两个点的坐标，由 左右端点 和 线型 构成。这篇文章就来探索一下，如何绘制一个支持各种样式，而且容易拓展的箭头。

1. 箭头部位的划分
首先要说一点，我希望获取的是箭头的 路径 ，而非单纯的绘制箭头。因为有了路径，可以做更多的事，比如根据路径裁剪、沿路径运动、多个路径间的合并操作等。当然，路径形成之后，绘制自然是非常简单的。所以在绘制技巧中，路径一个非常重要的话题。

代码实现如下，测试使用的起始点分别是 (40,40) 和 (200,40)，圆形路径以起始点为中心，宽高为 10。可以看出虽然实现了需求，但是都写在一块，代码看起来比较乱。当要涉及生成各种样式箭头时，在这里修改代码也是非常麻烦的，接下来要做的就是对箭头的路径形成过程进行抽象。

自健康码诞生以来，其使用体验就一直饱受诟病。其中最突出的便是：缓慢的启动速度，繁琐重复的多步操作。
于是我们就开始寻求各种方案。目前的“门派”有：iOS 捷径，URL Scheme ，利用 Accessibility ，截图，自行开发模仿界面（由此还引发了 2021 年 1 月的“健康码演示”事件）。
但从此刻开始，我不再愿意浪费我宝贵的时间，为无能的政腐“擦屁股”。提升健康码启动速度和便利性，避免公共场所核验导致的拥堵等种种问题，这是我的职责么？
又凭什么要求我一手拉着行李箱，另一手单手操作，提前打开两个健康码和一个行程码？我摔倒的风险，摔坏手机的风险，谁人承担？
我也曾多次埋怨他们没能提前打开健康码，嘲笑他们打开应用时因卡顿而焦躁的模样，为我的“聪明才智”而沾沾自喜。
但从此刻开始，我将移除我的设备上的所有此类改良措施；在动车站，我要等到了队伍前头，才放下手中的大包小包，从容地拿出手机，一步一步打开各种“码”。
站台上的工作人员呵斥我，一旁的同学指责我，后排西装革履的白领辱骂我，一如我从前的模样。但他们又能如何？
这是“躺平”么？是，也不是。幻想一下，如果人人都和我一样，那么此类情形发生的地方将完全地从“流水线”退化为串行，也许暴增的拥堵，交通的瘫痪，会唤醒一些什么。</span>

使用 WebStorm 创建 Vue 项目如果勾选 “Use the default project setup (babel,eslint) ”那么 vue-cli 默认创建的就是 Vue3 项目，可以修改默认创建版本吗？ 当然这个可以取消这个勾选然后创建的时候手动选择，但是我想应该是有配置或者是方式可以修改默认创建版本的。
每次创建一个新的项目都会在项目目录中新生成 node_modules 一个目录然后去下载相应的包，总之感觉这样操作很浪费时间和占用空间，很不合理，不知道是不是我没有配置或者是使用错误的原因，能不能像 java 的 maven 那种包管理方式，同样的包下载一次有依赖的项目直接引用就可以了。npm 好像可以使用 -g 参数全局安装一些包，这个能解决问题吗，其实就算能解决这个问题感觉涉及也不合理
Vue.js devtools 在很多资料中都说 Vue2 和 Vue3 要使用不同的插件 Vue3 要使用带 beta 字样的那个版本， 但是我实际使用过程中 就用普通的 Vue2 的新版本 devtools 插件一点也没有发现问题啊，反而使用 beta 字样版本的很多时候卡和无法使用, 这个问题到底是 Vue2 新版本插件增加了对 Vue3 的支持还是什么原因
npm build 的两个问题：1 ）有详细的资料介绍 打包后 CDN 优化的资料吗，网上看过一些感觉写的都不详细，2 ）打包的时候命名规则能自定义吗，我经常看到打包后的 js css 和一些样式的名字都要带一串数字  感觉很 low

service 是被 systemd 启动的，可是在 servrice 进入 loop 的时候，被 /lib/systemd/systemd kill 了。我为什么知道是被 systemd kill 了呢？因为我用 strace 命令追踪了它的系统调用。发现它向 service 发送了 SIGTERM 信号。如果用 systemctl start 重启，又会被杀。可是我如果手动键入命令行重启，就正常了。
老实说，以前只是粗浅了解过 systemd. 难道 systemd 发现了什么异常情况然后想杀掉 service?比如内存使用过多？因为我看启动 log 提示代码中有 calloc()函数分配失败的情况。不过由于代码过于庞大，目前还没有找到是哪里调用的 calloc （） 。网上搜索了一下，发现 systemd 限制内存似乎要看 /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/。可是我系统上连 /sys/fs/cgroup/memory 都不存在。</span>

一个逻辑问题，求知道的告知下，情况是这样的。某文件夹下有 N 段视频，这里随便举个例子，比如 10 段
分别为视频 1.mp4   2.mp4   3.mp4 以此类推到 10.mp4.
视频时长不等。
想做到 
需求 1
自动检测这 N 段视频，并按照时长 8 秒分割这些视频，最后剩余的如果小于于 6 秒则删除，分割后建立对应视频名称的文件夹并写入。
需求 2
抽取这些文件夹里面的 8 秒片段视频，每个文件夹仅抽取一段，10 个文件夹的话就是 10 段，合成一个视频，并记录合成视频采用片段的前后排序关系。完成后继续合成，并读取该文件，确保再次合成的视频顺序不和前面生成的视频有相同之处。这样的话其实应该有很多种可能
写的有点乱，大概通俗的说，我要生成的视频每小段均取自分别的 8 秒视频片段，但是排序不同有很多可能。不知道怎么表达？我凌乱了。
或者给我几个关键词。我研究研究。</span>

入 aws 之前，一直在注册甲骨文，一直失败，突然明白一件事：免费的东西才是最贵的！注册甲骨文真是个体力活，浪费时间，浪费精力。
ps ，能用钱解决的问题都不是问题，花点钱，获得更好的服务。

# 5 分钟发布一次总流量到 public mqtt broker ，在本地订阅。
*/5 * * * *  mosquitto_pub -r -L mqtt://broker.hivemq.com:1883/aws/networkTraffic -m  $(vnstat --oneline b | awk -F&#x27;;&#x27; &#x27;{print $11}&#x27; | awk &#x27;{print $1}&#x27;)


分析原因如下：
1.lightsail 流量双向计算，平均下来，每天 30g ，一个人使用都不够！就这一条，足以吓退一堆搞机场，挂 pt ，跑码，搞黑产的，这些都是流量大户，肯定吃不开！
2.aws 使用后计费的弹性计费模式，不认真看文档，乱点击，被收费的机率很大。
注意事项：
日常使用，不要开 icmp （ ping ），避免 icmp 类的 ddos 攻击。本地检测延时用 tcping 443 端口。</span>

很多人有在冰箱上贴便签或待办事项的习惯
如果 kindle 带个磁吸壳，就可以吸附在冰箱上
然后用浏览器查看在线日历和待办事项
优势：
1 、墨水屏，只在刷新的时候耗电，所以一次充电能用很久
2 、可以远程添加日历和待办事项，家庭使用的话，也可以订阅家人的日历，做到所有人的日历和事项都在一个页面解决
未解决的问题：
1 、无法做到主动刷新，例如有新日历或新事项推送时主动刷新
2 、目前没有日历和待办事项共存一个页面的 web ，日历可以基于服务商订阅，但是待办事项好像没有
3 、旧款的 kindle 屏幕还是太小了点</span>

Modern AI algorithms pose a hard barrier between training and inference. This necessitates separate infrastructures for each of training and inference, which doubles the cost. Such a separate system design gets increasingly tough to be managed efficiently when the algorithm scales out to thousands or more GPUs. To tackle this issue, this project pursues both algorithmic and systematic advances on continual learning by leveraging mixture-of-experts architecture in large-scale AI models. The intern will be supervised by both system experts in Networking Research Group and algorithm experts in CV Research Group.
2 、职位要求：
1. Investigate state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms for large-scale AI models
2. Develop novel algorithms to improve the continual learning performance by leveraging the mixture-of-experts architecture
3. Contribute to efficient system development by leveraging proposed algorithms
3 、具有以下条件者优先：
1. Experience in deep learning research regarding to this project
2. Fluent communication in English

有这样一种观点：
      联想收购了 IBM 之后得到很多新技术，在散热、硬盘保护上都有独到之处，电池非常耐用（可以待机 5-6 小时没问题），因此 5000 元以内很多都推荐联想 THINKPAD 。
 5000 元的本本有什么处理器以及显卡？
       多数持这样一种观点：i5-2450M 2G 320G 1G 独显
       i5 二代的处理器，2G 内存（可以拓展到 4G ），320G 硬盘，1G 独立显卡
 THINKPAD E420 这个系列是学生机，办公不适合？
       有些阐述了这种观点。
       他们多数推荐 X 系列。不过，价格 6000 以上。
       联想 ThinkPad X121e （ 30456AC ） 11.6 英寸 采用 Intel 酷睿 i3 2357M NVIDIA Quadro NVS 3000M 320GB 2GB ￥ 4550
       这款仅 4550 ，不过处理器是 I3 的，配置较 14 寸的笔记本就低了一些
  
比较客观的说法：
     目前在 5000 区域以内 配制普遍 CPU 都是 2 代 i5 ，显卡 1G 独显 A 卡或者 N 卡，设计推荐用 A 卡，N 卡是适合玩游戏，两者差别不大游戏也是一样，但是 A 卡的画质处理性能比 N 卡强的不是一般的高，所以推荐用 A 卡。（这里的 A 卡，指的应该是 AMD 的显卡芯片,玩游戏似乎都是用 N 卡的多)
      因此，到底买什么型号可以这样界定：
     1.联想 THINKPAD
     2.CPU I5 显卡 A 卡
     3.若能 X 系列更好，原因比较轻便，外观出去更有面子，不过价格不好取舍</span>

                              <span>For many companies, performance is the main reason to go with GraphQL. But is that a valid argument? Often developers compare GraphQL to REST APIs and see the N+1 requests (or over-fetching) as an important reason to go for GraphQL. Let&#x27;s put that to the test and explore if GraphQL APIs actually can outperform existing REST APIs. For this, we&#x27;ll take a GraphQL-ized REST API and test the performance of GraphQL and compare it to the REST approach. For this we&#x27;ll be using the popular performance testing tool k6.
Before exploring a GraphQL API, let&#x27;s learn more about the technology. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, designed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012 to handle API requests on low bandwidth networks. After being used internally, GraphQL was open-sourced in 2015. Since 2019 its trademar…</span>

                              <span>When working with a GitHub repository, you&#x27;ll often need to identify yourself to GitHub using your username and password. An SSH key is an alternate way to identify yourself that doesn&#x27;t require you to enter you username and password every time. To add such key, you need to generate it on your PC. To generate and add it to GitHub, you need to follow following steps,
The SSH key can be generated using ssh-keygen command using git bash as below,
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;

replace your_email@example.com with your actual email address.
By default, the SSH key will be stored in the home directory. Now, you need to copy the public key. The public key can be seen using cat command as below,
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the public key from terminal. The final step is to add it to the GitHub. 

To add it, go to your GitHub profile settings &gt; SSH and GPG keys &gt; new SSH key, add title for your key and paste the public key in Key box.

                              <span>The world of DevOps has given so many opportunities for software organizations. Software development best practices have given rise to many platforms and tools to deploy software quickly and easily. Kubernetes and Helm can do so much together in helping developers deploy software with less effort. Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for running container-based apps in the enterprise. In fact, organizations aim at running all their production deployments on Kubernetes. 
These are exciting times for those in the Kubernetes community because we’re seeing more and more users leverage its extended capabilities for even deeper operational insight and control. One such capability is the use of Helm to package and deploy individual Kubernetes applications.

                              <span>If you’re familiar with Flutter, you’re definitely familiar with FutureBuilder. After all this is the only way you can fetch data in Flutter with proper state, or is it? But you might’ve noticed every time the Widget gets rebuild the Future is run along too unless you declare your Future in initState
But even if you declare your future in initState to avoid reruns across rebuilds it will still rerun when the Widget gets disposed &amp; mounted again. So what’s the solution? Ans: FutureProvider from riverpod or provider
Hold on a sec, but it’s not another riverpod/provider article? No, it&#x27;s not.
Yeah, to cache your future results or server response in you can use FutureProvider. It can store &amp; distribute the result all across the application without multiple reruns of the same operation. But wha…</span>

                              <span>A new feature has emerged in your favorite software testing solution! The graphic recognition of elements of your applications (web, mobile, desktop) to make comparisons of graphic elements with each other.
Until now, detections and comparisons of application elements required capturing an element and its text attributes. To do this, you used the capture tool of Agilitest which allowed you to dig into the tree structure of your application and its data logic.
Now, this capture tool has been expanded with a graphical capture possibility which &quot;photographs&quot; a small area of ​​the application in order to detect its occurrence during a test, once or several times.
To use the graphics recognition functionality, simply open the Agilitest capture tool and select a rectangular area. The blue selection rectangle allows you to choose the area to be captured, for later detection during a test.

Once the image is selected, Agilitest allows you to copy or save the image for external use, but you can also drop the image directly in an Agilitest comment or access the tree of elements to generate an activatable zone...

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool. Being an Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool, it streamlines the authentication process for applications and IT services.
The purpose of an IAM tool is to ensure that the right people in a company have appropriate access to resources. It usually enables the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO), identity federation, and strong authentication.
It is becoming a more and more critical topic daily to secure applications. Not only that, but it can potentially cost millions of dollars in the form of various financial penalties for unauthorized access to protected data.

                              <span>This series explores how we can keep our code declarative as we adapt our features to progressively higher levels of complexity.
Sometimes multiple stores need to react to a single DOM event. Let&#x27;s say we have a button in our template that sets all colors in all stores to black. If it weren&#x27;t for Rule 2, we might write a click handler like this:
  setAllToBlack() {
    // &#x60;set&#x60; is a state change that should come by default with every adapter
    this.favoriteStore.set([&#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;]);
    this.dislikedStore.set([&#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;]);
    this.neutralStore.set([&#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;]);
}

But this would log 3 &quot;events&quot; in Devtools back-to-back. Not to mention the total number of imperative statements is 4 now, instead of just the 1 from the template.

Looks like a lot of devs are already on vacation 😎. On my side I will also skip some editions this summer to rest.
This week, we have a good variety of React and React-Native content. A lot of very positive feedback from the community on Bun!
On my side, Docusaurus 2.0 should be released soon, after 4 years of alpha/beta. I hope you will help me to make the launch a success! I&#x27;m thinking of sending you a different email for the occasion, to better present this tool I&#x27;m working on for Facebook.

The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when the programmer needs to execute a block of code several times. For this purpose, The programming languages provide various kinds of loops that are able to repeat some particular code numerous numbers of times. Here, we are going to talk about looping statements in Python.
In a programming language, a looping statement contains instructions that continually repeat until a certain condition is reached. Read on to find out more about them.

TikTok is starting to offer users a new level of control over their For You page. The company announced today that you’ll be able to specify specific words or hashtags you don’t want to see in your feeds, and the app will automatically filter them out. TikTok’s examples are fairly simple — like when you’ve finished a reno and don’t want to see DIY videos anymore or decide you don’t want to see cooking tutorials using a certain type of food or meat. But these kinds of filters could be used to much more carefully control your feed.
The platform is also rolling out two new automated moderation and filtering tools. One, called Content Levels, ranks content based on “thematic maturity” and is designed to keep mature content of all types from...

Welcome to our repository of only the best Amazon Prime Day 2022 deals for Prime members. What will you find in here? You’ll find big discounts on tech products that we actually like, and other Verge-y stuff that we feel comfortable recommending based on specs and price. What you won’t find are bad, also-ran deals that appear at several other times of the year. You don’t have time for that, and we don’t have time for that, either. That criteria means we’re trying to keep the list trim to make it easier to peruse.
If you aren’t ready to shop Prime Day 2022 deals today, fret not, as many of them should last through Wednesday, July 13. And we’ll be updating this post throughout the big sale event, with the freshest and best deals occupying...

We’re in the midst of Amazon Prime Day, and yet some of the best Prime Day deals to be had aren’t on Amazon’s site at all. While Best Buy is calling its sales “Black Friday in July” — which makes even less sense than calling a two-day event Prime Day, singular — Walmart is running deals of its own. It’s commonplace to see Walmart and the others matching many of the deals Amazon throws out there, as well as promoting some unique ones of its own. 
Some of these deals can be a little unexpected and especially good, while some are just what we’d call a fine discount on any other day of the year. However, if you happen to be a Walmart Plus subscriber, there may be added incentive to find these deals at your retailer of choice, like taking...

Amazon Prime Day is the second-best time of year to bag some smart home gadgets at excellent prices. While Black Friday and its various offshoots traditionally have deeper discounts and wider product options, Prime Day feels strategically situated on the calendar as an ideal buying season for those invested in the smart home. This is particularly true if you are looking for some bargains on Amazon Alexa devices or compatible gadgets.
This year, there are some good deals to be found for Prime members this July 12th and 13th on everything from smart thermostats and smart locks to security cameras and smart lighting. Plus, it’s a great time to stock up on a couple more Echo speakers if there’s a room in your house that still doesn’t have...

If you’re a savvy tech shopper, you can set your watch to the annual cadence of TV deals. There are the big ones, like Black Friday and the Super Bowl, and then smatterings around and in-between with Memorial Day, Labor Day, and some others. Amazon Prime Day has become another notable TV shopping holiday, with its somewhat annual cadence and occasional date changes starting back in 2015. With Prime Day 2022 kicking off, it’s another great chance to get a new 4K TV or upgrade your existing one for something better, faster, and maybe even bigger.
Among all the Prime Day deals we’re covering here at The Verge (smart home tech, earbuds, phones, laptops, and much more), this is one of the biggest. There are TVs with OLED and Mini LED panels...

This year’s Amazon Prime Day is delivering a ton of great deals, but some of the best — naturally — are on Amazon’s own products. So if you’ve been eyeing the newest Kindle or one of the many Alexa-powered smart displays, now is a good time to make the leap.
Below, we’ve listed the best Prime Day discounts available on Amazon devices, from e-readers and smart speakers to TVs, home security systems, and even Wi-Fi routers. Also, if you’re looking for deals on non-Amazon goods, be sure to check out our massive list of the best Prime Day deals happening right now.

Amazon Prime Day is finally upon us, and with it comes a variety of excellent deals on gaming hardware and accessories, not to mention games. This year, you can even grab some cool odds and ends to round out your gaming setup at home, whether you’re looking to personalize your peripherals or elevate the production of your Twitch stream.
While it’s still a bit ambitious to expect discounts on next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, we’re definitely keeping our ears to the ground for restocks of the console at Amazon and other retailers.

We can wholeheartedly recommend picking the Meta Quest 2 for its ease of use and accessibility, but Amazon has also discounted the HTC Vive...

如果你想知道谈话类节目、室外采访、环境音or白噪音、直播、读书类节目，以及「不在场 」这样包含音乐弹奏类的节目是通过哪些设备录制的，绝对不能错过本期推送。
强烈建议收藏本文！！
 

 
经过对许多播客创作者的咨询，我们发现播客机构对于设备的选择比较类似，使用最广泛的设备是罗德Caster Pro+Podmic，和Zoom+舒尔 SM58麦克风。但由于节目形态、预算、录制形式、声音条件等方面的要求，很多创作者选择了其他设备，我们来看看大家是怎么说的。
（类目内按信息回复时间前后排序）
谈话类
 

 
播客公社（超级游文化，特费神，体坛站着侃，呆萌刺猬等）：
 
设备为RODE Caster Pro+PodMic，这是非移动录制需求环境下比较合适的设备，专门针对播客创作者设计，自带的算法让声音不会爆，还自带主动降噪功能。 
 

 
 

 
日谈公园：
 
设备为Zoom录音机（H6）+动圈麦克风（灵敏度低，SM58），如果有外出录音需要用小蜜蜂，推荐罗德 Wireless go二代
 

 
 

小黄鱼播客网络（博物志、bibiEdit、蒙台啥利、哈利播客等）：
 
Zoom H5+舒尔SM58（ 蒙台啥利：森海塞尔XS1），指向型动圈麦适用于不完美的录音环境，比如在家的时候，因为只会收到离麦克风比较近的声音。
舒尔的这款麦克风非常经典，但大家如果是闲鱼上购入，需要注意可能会碰到假货。

大内密谈：
 
录制设备：Zoom LiveTrak L-8（录音棚）、Zoom H5（外出）
麦克风：Shure SM58

                              <span>原则
在之前的一篇文章《做一个不完美的完美主义者——从「整理」开始》（下称《整理》）里， 我介绍了关于整理的一些原则和工具。有朋友留言说希望能够介绍一下这些方法的 workflow，即如何把这些方法落地到日常中的。
我决定套一下娃，用我是如何写作《整理》这篇文章作为一个例子，来讲讲我是如何在自己的项目中使用这些方法原则的。
首先我们来迅速回顾一下《整理》中提到的原则：
好记性不如烂笔头：记录下所有的想法，不管是大是小
珍惜有限的注意力：通过把所有的想法都记录在工具里，把自己有限的注意力放在正在做的事情上
二八原则（帕累托原则）：把重要的时间首先放在重要的内容上
敏捷思维：小步快跑，迭代并联处理问题，而非使用串联的思维
笔记也有「hierarchy」：把笔记分类，不同类的笔记用不同的方法、工具处理
把时间作为必不可少的朋友：在记录笔记时，尽量加入时间的维度
写作的故事
我产生写作《整理》这篇文章的契机，其实是在我一次写日记的时候。
在我之前的一篇关于写日记的文章里，我建议在写日记的时候准备一张白纸在一旁，把大脑里有趣的、碎片的想法用一些关键词记录下来，有的之后可以在日记里覆盖，有的可以放到别的地方，以后再展开。
在某次写日记时，我的思绪回到了我申请硕士的时候。当时我找朋友填写一个问卷，讲讲她们对我的看法，其中有一个朋友说我非常井井有条、把项目文件整理得很好。
当时我就转念一想，那么为什么不把自己关于整理的方法整理一下呢？这既可以帮助我自己整理思绪，也可以分享给需要的朋友。于是，我抓起旁边的白纸，在上面写下了这样一些关键词：
写作时的小纸条
写下这些碎片，应该是在去年年底的事情了。在那之后生活里发生了很多事情，这篇文章的优先级也总是被别的文章挤下去。但是这张纸条我一直夹在日记本里。
今年年初的时候我开始用 Notion，专门建了一个写作的文件夹，里边放了许多我想写的话题。

Open source is one of the most important technology trends of our time. It’s the lifeblood of the digital economy and the preeminent way that software-based innovation happens today. In fact, it’s estimated that over 90% of software released today contains open source libraries.
There&#x27;s no doubt the open source model is effective and impactful. But is there still room for improvement? When comparing the broader software industry’s processes to that of open source communities, one big gap stands out: productivity management.
By and large, open source project leads and maintainers have been slow to adopt modern productivity and project management …</span>

I recently wrote a C program in Linux to create a smaller random selection of MP3 files from my extensive MP3 library. The program goes through a directory containing my MP3 library, and then creates a directory with a random, smaller selection of songs. I then copy the MP3 files to my smartphone to listen to them on the go.
Sweden is a sparsely populated country with many rural areas where you don&#x27;t have full cell phone coverage. That&#x27;s one reason for having MP3 files on a smartphone. Another reason is that I don&#x27;t always have the money for a streaming service, so I like to have my own copies of the songs I enjoy.
You can download my application from its Git reposito…</span>

多年来，黑客们经常用恶意的宏来攻击 Office 文件。微软原本计划要求 Office 用户在打开从互联网下载的 Office 文件时，通过在文件属性中专门勾选一个解禁选项来启用宏程序。之前计划在 6 月份实施。但微软在 6 月 30 日突然撤销了这一阻止。微软解释称，“根据用户的反馈，我们暂时回退了这一变化，同时我们做了一些额外的改变以提高可用性。”目前，Office 用户可以简单地在文件顶部的横幅上点击一个启用按钮。微软称，“这是一个临时的变化，我们完全致力于为所有用户进行默认的改变。”

老王点评：宏给 Office 带来的好处不如它带来的问题更多，这一举措确实有助于微软提供更好的产品体验。




PyPI 将向关键项目赠送 4000 个安全密钥

PyPI 由 Python 软件基金会（PSF）管理，是 Python 开发人员获得第三方开发的开源包的主要仓库。这些库的安全影响到了整个 Python 生态的安全，PSF 现在强制要求“关键项目”的开发人员在未来几个月内使用双因素认证（2FA），这使得开发人员可以保护自己难于盗取凭证。任何在过去六个月里下载量排名前 1% 的项目将被视作关键项目，有超过 3800 个项目被评为“关键”，这涉及到 8241 个 PyPI 用户。作为 PSF 的赞助商，谷歌开源安全团队提供了 4000 个谷歌泰坦安全密钥，以分发给这些维护者。PyPI 数据显示，目前有 28336 个用户启用了 2FA，其中近 27000 个用户使用的是像“微软验证器”这样的 2FA 应用。

老王点评：虽然 2FA 密钥不能完全避免被盗取凭证，但是却可提供大部分保护。




美国企业领导人敦促加强计算机科学教育

超过 500 名美国的商业、教育和非营利组织领导人发表了一封公开信，呼吁美国各州政府和教育负责人为全美的 K-12 学生提供更多的计算机科学教育。他们称，“美国在技术方面领先世界，但我们的高中生中只有 5% 学习计算机科学。这怎么能接受呢？……近三分之二的高技能移民是计算机科学家，每个州都是这种战略人才的进口商。美国有超过 70 万个开放的计算机职位，但每年只有 8 万名计算机科学毕业生。”

老王点评：从这个风向标来看，学计算机还是挺有前景的，当然，我建议你留着国内发展。</span>

无论你有多少存储空间，了解文件占用了多少磁盘空间都是一个重要的考虑事项。我的笔记本有一个相对较小的 250GB NVME 驱动器，大多数时候都没什么问题，但几年前我开始探索 Linux 上的游戏，情况变得有所不同，安装 Steam 和其他游戏使存储管理更加重要。

du 命令

检查磁盘驱动器上剩余存储空间最简单的方法是 du 命令。它会估计文件空间使用情况，像其他所有 Linux 工具一样，du 非常强大，但学会如何根据你的特定需求使用它会很有帮助。我总是查阅手册页来掌握实用程序的用法。du 有几个选项，可以为你提供文件存储的最佳快照，以及它们在系统上消耗多少空间。

du 命令有很多选项，以下是一些常见的：


-a - 包括文件夹和文件在内的存储信息

--apparent-size - 打印自身大小而不是占用磁盘量

-h - 人类可读的格式

-b - 以字节为单位

-c - 总计

-k - 以块为单位

-m - 以兆字节为单位的大小


务必查看 du 手册页获取完整帮助列表。

显示所有文件

你可以选择的第一个选项是 du -a，它可以显示系统上所有文件及其存储目录的大小。这个命令让我知道了我的主目录中存储了 11555168 个字节。使用 du -a 可以快速递归地查看我的存储系统。如果我想要一个更有意义的数字，并且我想深入到目录中查看大文件的位置，该怎么办？

我认为在 Downloads 目录下有一些大文件，所以我输入 du -a /home/don/Downloads 来查看。

$ du -a ~/Downloads
4923    ./UNIX_Driver_5-0/UNIX Driver 50

                              <span>Internxt 发布了一个新产品，它可以让你快速地将加密文件发送给任何人，同时保持你的隐私。嗯，我们只能希望它不会像 Firefox Send 那样关闭吧……




Internxt 是一个相当新的开源加密云服务，旨在取代大型科技公司的产品。例如，你可以把它作为谷歌的相册和云端硬盘的替代品。

它免费提供 10 GB 的容量。所以，如果感兴趣的话，你可以注册个账号试一试。

最近，他们还新增了另一个产品 “Internxt Send”，作为 Firefox Send 的替代品，填补这个空缺。

唉，说到这里还挺遗憾的，Firefox Send 已停止服务了，不得不说它是一个很好的工具！

不过，Internxt Send 让你可以像 Firefox Send 一样安全地发送/共享图像、视频、文档和其他文件。

Internxt Send：一个安全的文件共享服务



我在 GitHub 上找不到 Internxt Send 的存储库，但我已经要求他们澄清了。

（LCTT 译注：虽然 Internxt 是在 GitHub 上开源的，但是 GitHub 上没有 Internxt Send 这个产品的存储库，产品的介绍里也没有声称它是开源的。）

正如你所期望的那样，你无需创建帐户即可将文件上传到 Internxt Send。

文件上传限制为 5 GB。而且，你不能以任何方式提高这个限制。

你可以选择文件，上传并生成共享链接。或者，你也可以直接向收件人发送电子邮件，那样的话，你需要在邮件里分享你的电子邮件地址。



有趣的是，它还允许你在这个电子邮件中添加自定义文本。

与 Firefox Send 不同的是，你无法修改文件共享链接的到期时间，或者是让它在多次下载后失效。默认情况下，链接会在 15 天后过期，你无法更改这个时间。嗯，这还挺扫兴的。

但是，对于那些正在苦苦等待一个加密的共享文件服务的人来说，这可能是一种替代方案。

我认为有更多的 Firefox Send 替代品是件好事！你对 Internxt Send 有何看法？欢迎在下方评论区里和大家分享。

                              <span>背景
在实际业务中，app中的H5页面使用的场景越来越多，在货拉拉app中也存在大量的H5页面，比如金秋拉货节、余额、车型介绍页等，加载速度成为了困扰用户的一个痛点。为此我们决定引入离线包方案，另外还需要解决传统离线包方案不灵活，体积大，不易管理，不易降级等问题，我们设计和开发一套H5离线包系统，经过几个sdk版本的迭代，目前货拉拉H5离线包sdk，已在多个业务中落地，接受了大量用户检验。车型介绍页面使用离线包前后打开效果：
行业方案
目前H5离线包方案，通常是将离线包置入assets目录中，打包在apk内部，用户使用过程中再按需加载。所以大部分情况下可能存在以下问题：
由于离线包内容固定导致更新不及时
当离线包内容较多或者离线包个数较多时，会严重影响App包体积
由于离线包内部的逻辑固定，当出现问题时无法降级，无法禁用
上线没有数据对比无法知道上线效果
针对以上痛点，我们团队对离线包进行设计优化，应用于团队内的多个应用，多个业务场景中。
技术实现
H5离线包的基本原理是将html、js、css、图片等静态资源打包到成压缩文件，然后下载到客户端，H5加载时静态资源直接从本地取文件，减少网络请求，提高速度。加载本地文件路径存在的问题和解决：
存在问题
解决方法




cgi请求跨域
跨域请求头增加null支持


cookie跨域问题
目前静态js中无cookie操作，没有cookie跨域问题


localstorage跨域问题
暂时不涉及域名隔离问题，如果有需要，采取调用原生的方式解决


前端使用绝对路径问题
相对路径



4.1 总体结构
H5发布基本流程

App端流程图

前端的打包平台，支持发布为线上页面，也支持发布为离线包。离线包模式时，客户端会先查询是否有离线包需要更新，有则更新，同时支持离线包降级为线上网页。
H5离线包和线上H5一样也能进行更新和升级…</span>

As Yulia Brodskaya began to apply the curled and crimped tendrils of paper to her latest work, she tells Colossal that the firebird portrait “started as a visual representation of a powerful feeling rising from the deep,” adding that “it felt like this portrait has been ‘channelled’ through me.”
Brodskaya captures the subtleties of individual expression and character in her elaborate portraits (previously) and depictions of flora and fauna. More</span>

科学家找到了一类量子算法可以解决的新问题

1994 年数学家 Peter Shor 想出了如何让量子计算机完成普通经典计算机无法做到的事情。原则上，一台基于量子规则的机器可有效地将大数分解为质因数，这对于经典计算机来说，这是一项非常困难的任务。但三十年来，科学家们仅在一个被称为 NP 的标准集中发现了一个单一的、狭窄的问题类别可以显著加速。今年四月，科学家们又发现了一类量子计算可以以指数级速度解决的问题：它涉及仅根据混乱的输出来计算复杂数学过程的输入。

老王点评：目前看起来量子计算还只能用在很狭窄的领域，什么时候可以进行通用计算，或许带来的是颠覆性的变化，对这一天，我是又期盼，又恐惧。




过去十年的本田车型都可能受到网络攻击

安全研究人员发布了他们使用手持无线电解锁和远程启动几辆本田汽车的视频，他们称，这是因为 2012 年至今 10 年间生产的许多本田汽车的无钥匙进入系统存在漏洞。这种攻击使用无线电设备记录来自钥匙扣的合法无线电信号，然后将其传送到汽车上。这被称为重放攻击。理论上，每个信号应该只起一次作用；当按下按钮解锁汽车时，车就会解锁并且这个信号不应该再次用于解锁。但安全研究人员发现，这种攻击之所以奏效是因为它能够重新同步汽车的计数器，使之可以接受旧的代码。但本田否认了这一漏洞。

                              <span>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 是迄今为止最好的 Ubuntu 版本之一。是什么让它如此安全？




早在今年 4 月就发布了的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，是迄今为止最安全的 Ubuntu 版本。

其安全更新的延长支持、新的硬件支持和其他林林总总的改进，使它在安全方面远远超过了之前的所有版本。

但它是如何做到这一点的呢？还有，是什么让这个版本与以前的版本不同的呢？

嗯，有几个原因，Canonical 在一篇新的博客文章中为我们重点指出了这些。在这里，让我总结一下，以帮助你了解更多。

是什么让 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 变得安全？

在这个版本中，Ubuntu 团队似乎投入了大量的工作来确保其长期的安全性和可靠性。尽管多年来他们以难以想象的方式做到了这一点，但我将强调其中的几件事：


改进的硬件安全措施支持

更新了安全包

私有家目录

OpenSSL 3

GCC 11

nftables 作为默认的防火墙后端

Linux 内核改进


1、改进的硬件安全措施支持



随着英特尔、AMD 和 ARM 的 CPU/SoC 开始推出更多的安全措施，拥有足够的软件来让这些功能发挥作用就变得越来越重要。

截至目前，Ubuntu 22.04 支持三种主要的硬件安全措施。

英特尔的 “软件保护扩展Software Guard eXtensions”（SGX）提供了一个安全独立的区域来进行敏感计算。例如，理想情况下，密码处理将在这里进行，因为它确保没有其他应用程序可以访问这些数据。

还有 AMD 的“安全加密虚拟化Secure Encrypted Virtualization”（SEV）。这项技术旨在防止主机操作系统干扰正在运行的虚拟机。

尽管这与桌面用户的相关性不如其他技术，但要知道，很多数据中…</span>

                              <span>学习如何用静态链接库将多个 C 目标文件结合到一个单个的可执行文件之中。


使用 C 编写的应用程序时，通常有多个源码文件，但最终你需要编译成单个的可执行文件。

你可以通过两种方式来完成这项工作：通过创建一个 静态static 库 或 一个 动态dynamic 库（也被称为 共享shared 库）。从创建和链接的方式来看，它们是两种不同类型的库。选择使用哪种方式取决于你的的具体场景。

在 上一篇文章 中，我演示了如何创建一个动态链接的可执行文件，这是一种更通用的方法。在这篇文章中，我将说明如何创建一个静态链接的可执行文件。

使用静态库链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的多个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名称为可执行文件的一个可运行程序。

静态库是通过复制一个程序中的所有依赖库模块到最终的可执行镜像来创建的。链接器将链接静态库作为编译过程的最后一步。可执行文件是通过解析外部引用、将库例程与程序代码结合在一起来创建的。

创建目标文件

这里是一个静态库的示例以及其链接过程。首先，创建带有这些函数识别标志的头文件 mymath.h :

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：…</span>

今年，该项目向 18 岁或以上的任何人开放 —— 不仅限于学生和应届毕业生了。参与者通过编写软件获得报酬，其 津贴 的金额取决于他们所在国家/地区的 购买力平价。

LCTT 译注：以往，这个活动只允许在校学生参与，今年条件放开，只需年龄 18+ 即可，对参与者的贡献时长要求也降低了，尽可能地让更多人参与进来。不过，今年的报名通道在 4 月 19 日就截止了，大家有兴趣的话明年可以关注一下。

这也是 Zephyr 项目第一次作为 Linux 基金会的项目，参与到谷歌编程之夏中。让我们一起欢迎这些贡献者及其项目吧！

项目一：基于 Zephyr 的 Arduino 模块

1 个贡献者（350 小时）。

Arduino 是一个流行的框架，它为嵌入式设备编程提供了一个简化的接口。最近，Arduino 采用 mbed OS 作为其一些新设备的基础 RTOS。通过这项工作，他们将 Arduino Core 作为独立的抽象层，从 Arduino Core for mbed 中分离出来。这为在其他操作系统上利用 Arduino Core 开辟了可能性。

该项目的想法就是创建一个利用 Arduino Core 的 Zephyr 模块，以便开发人员在与 Arduino 兼容的设备上使用 Arduino 框架时，可以使用 Zephyr 作为底层操作系统。对用户的好处包括：


可以访问 Arduino API 以及高级 Zephyr 功能

2009 年的春天，一个奇奇怪怪的手机玩家社区冒出来，从 Logo 到域名，从前台运营到后台程序，一切都是社群用户一起讨论和搭建的。我也没想到，这会成为我接下来十三年为之奋斗的小事业。
那时的互联网行业，Web 2.0 如日中天，正是下海创业的好时机。知乎还孕育在 Apple4.us 的群体博客里，小红书的创始人还在外企中历练。而我们只是一群小众玩家，真的啥都不懂，只是觉得，网络社区可以一夜之间聚集这么多不同背景、不同领域的用户，真的太神奇了，那种源于内心的喜悦和冲动，也许就是所谓的初心吧。
我从来没有想过，这些人留下的数据和内容就是未来的金钱，而是一直在思考，这样一个有趣的组织形式，这样一群充满热情的人聚在一起，一定能做成一些有价值的事情。所以，三年之后，我们真的有机会以千万估值卖给上市公司的时候，我几乎没有认真考虑过，并不是嫌钱少，而是感觉这件事才刚刚开始，我还有很多想法没有去真正实践。
早年的少数派
2012 年建立的少数派，只是我们解构社区的第一步，从内容链条开始，先做一个闭环看看，但因为缺乏经验和行业资源，随便一做就是三年。
这个阶段，正值移动互联网大潮起步，Talkbox 刚刚火爆，微信黄雀已经悄悄上线，新浪微博开始发力移动客户端。资本市场更是热火朝天，拿个 PPT 就能融个几百万。我们虽然整天研究和体验这些移动应用产品，却从没有想过去做点什么，依然专注搭建高质量的内容体系，不知不觉又错过了一个时代风口。

2016 年，我们终于有了一点基础，正值微信公众号红利期，投资人建议我们放弃一切，all in 公众号粉丝和数据。我们却选择组建产品开发团队，重构自己的社区产品体系，但过度的理想化，对产品预期过高，很快就耗尽资金跌入低谷。
尽管我们几经周折，不断面对行业洗礼，却从没放弃对社区价值体系的底层思考，它不是简单的 UGC 和 PGC，也不仅仅是售卖内容和流量，社区的价值远不止这些。从搭建 Matrix 内容共创体系，到 Tron 计划产品共创模块，这背后是复杂的用户系统、内容付费和商品模块，在有限的资源里，我们一直在克服困难和挑战，一块一块的去完成理想中的社区拼图。
会员首页设计图
今天的少数派会员，已经不是其他平台的内容 VIP 概念，而是一个全新的社区系统了。我们为此打造了全新的内容界面、个人权益中心、专有知识库、以及高质量的话题群。在这个系统里，我们会重新汇聚各个行业的精英用户，尝试与他们深度共创，这些成果会直接进入到已经基本完善的少数派商业链条中，尽管它目前只服务几千人，但我们相信这里的共创价值将是无限的。

当然，每一个共创者，都会享有价值回馈，你的创作、创意、分享都会变成各种权益和收益，汇聚到新的会员中心里。接下来一年，会员社群、会员认证、会员协作链条，都会逐步开发完善起来。
至此，我们才算完成了最初的那个理想中的社区梦想，高质量的交流、高质量的产出、高质量的价值链。从这里开始，我们也算正式开启了第二阶段的创业，而每一个会员用户，都算是这次创业的参与者和见证者，也是那些真正能影响多数人的少数派。
当然，这个选择会带来两个结果，一个是有门槛的筛选，另一个是有限的用户规模，我们又走了一条少数人的路，挑战依然很多，但这才是我们原本的社区初心。
再次感谢大家对少数派十年来的一路支持，这趟新旅程即将开启，欢迎你跟我们一起探索「小众社区」的新价值！</span>

                              <span>THORN 是一个数字内容生产力工具，主要用于帮助你梳理思维碎片，更舒适地进行写作以及更方便地与你的读者分享你的创作。

去年11月开启内测，虽然 THORN 在交互设计和写作体验方面的重视，得到了不少用户的认可，但有不少用户抱怨 THORN 在网络环境不稳定的时候，使用体验并不好。当时，我们的第一反应是，这好像不是 THORN 的问题。
但紧接着，我们心里就冒出个疑问，对于写作类应用来说，网络真的是必须的吗？以此为契机，团队接下来的讨论延伸了一系列的问题，特别是关于隐私和安全方面的问题。
我们果断暂停了开发工作，停下来重新思考 THORN 应该是一个怎样的软件应用？然后，基于隐私、速度和实用的基础，经过大量的调研和实践，我们开始认识到本地优先之于 THORN 的无限可能性:

我们相信数据所有权和实时协作并不矛盾。可以创建具有云应用程序所有优点的软件，同时还允许您保留对您创建的所有数据的所有权和控制权。
我们将这种类型的软件称为本地优先软件，因为它优先使用本地存储，而不是远程数据中心中的服务器。
在云应用程序中，服务器上的数据被视为数据的主要副本；如果客户端拥有数据的副本，则它只是从属于服务器的缓存。任何数据修改都必须发送到服务器。在本地优先应用程序中，我们交换了这些角色：我们将本地设备（笔记本电脑、平板电脑或手机）上的数据副本视为主要副本。服务器仍然存在，但它们保存数据的辅助副本，以帮助从多个设备进行访问。

紧接着，我们豁然开朗，好像所有的问题都被解决了。
回到前面对本地优先软件的描述，好像和一些具备云端备份的本地写作软件没什么区别对吧？ 其实不然，请继续往下看。

不抛弃云端，但是本地优先
对于多设备同步和用户协作，传统的基于云的解决方案已经在很多产品和服务上取得了成功。尽管它们允许您在任何地方访问您的数据，但所有数据的访问都必须通过它们的服务器进行，您只被允许做服…</span>

                              <span>前几天，少楠评论了我的一个即刻动态。

这个动态里的想法源于我在 flomo 共建群里看到的一个群友的提问：

大家有没有什么整理 memo 的小技巧，感觉随着时间推移，大量零碎的不成体系的 memo 增加了我对 flomo 使用的压力。

在整理思路的时候，我上知乎搜了搜，发现这个问题其实很多人都有遇到：记录了很多笔记，但是因为记得太多，导致笔记杂乱、臃肿，仿佛长年累月吃进了很多无法消化的杂食，这些庞大数量的笔记无法变成自己的东西，然后产生了一些压力甚至焦虑。
可能会有的解决办法
有的朋友会选择在定期对笔记进行删减和清空，按照「极简」的思路，对笔记做减法；但也有人说不用删，因为总有一些句子和当时的闪念会启发到你，成为你日后文章的素材。删与不删，让人纠结。
也有的朋友选择了对现有笔记打标签、做分类。这样可以尽可能多地覆盖已有笔记。这也是一个办法。

但是在一次性批量打标签、做分类的过程中，我们无法细致地品味每一个笔记和还原当时记录时的上下文。
说到上下文的还原，我就联想到了「渐进式总结」，通过高亮、笔记和提炼的多个层级的备注，让笔记既能在高空中一目了然，又能潜入笔记的具体上下文。渐进式总结的核心思路是写给未来的自己，所以我们需要尽可能让未来的我们在提取笔记时更容易1。

一个多月前，我在赋闲在家，时间充裕，在 Obsidian 上记的笔记都比较翔实，也会用 Cubox 践行渐进式总结。但是，当我人来到义乌后，经常出门不带电脑，突如其来的碎片化灵感只能记录在 flomo 里，这让我意识到记笔记的场景不一定是深度的阅读和学习。可能是洗澡时某一个闪念一划而过；也可能在读书时的拍案叫绝的临时摘抄；或者是经历过一次新奇体验的“正念时刻”，想要立马记下来。
如果还要我先打上标签，然后列出关键词，还要做好分类，并且要介绍清楚当时的背景、上下文，可能当我写完这些后，灵感已经因为被遮蔽太久，…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Cloud Computing&quot; is the need-based provision of IT resources via the Internet at usage-based prices. Instead of purchasing, owning, and maintaining physical data centres and servers, you can access technology services such as compute, storage, and databases on-demand through a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Key advantages:
Types of Cloud computing:

It’s very good feel that if you are going to learn leading cloud provider AWS. They are the leader in Cloud computing because of:

Gartner Research positions AWS in the Leaders quadrant in the new 2021 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure &amp; Platform Services (CIPS) report. CIPS are defined in the context of this &quot;Magic Quadrant&quot; as &quot;standardised, highly automated offerings in which infrastructure resources (e.g. compute, network and storage resources) are supplemented with integrated platform services&quot;.
Global Infrastructure AWS

AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers so many regions and Availability Zones, all characterized by low latency, high throughput and a highly redundant network. AWS is available in 84 Availability Zones within 26 geographic regions worldwide. In addition, 24 additional Availability Zones and 8 additional AWS regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are planned. The AWS Regions and Availability Zones model is recommended by Gartner as a best practice for running enterprise applications that require high availability.

Instance fields can be initialized in 4 ways: 
At the point of protestation 
In a constructor argument using &#x27;this&#x27; 
In the constructor’s initializer list before the law in braces starts.
Anywhere Differently 
4 is problematic since the preface of null safety. By the time the constructor body( the law in braces) starts, the object must be completely initialized so each of its fields are usable. So if it isn&#x27;t initialized in 1, 2, or 3, it fails to collect. 
It literally means “ I&#x27;ll initialize it latterly ”. And you got no error.

Still, you only know this at runtime when the program fails, If you forget to initialize a late variable. Basically, you say “ Trust me to initialize d ever before it&#x27;s read for the first time ”. So the compiler skips the initialization check and inserts a runtime check.

There&#x27;s a stir to allow skipping the initialization checks in some shapes. This may beget segfault which is harder to probe than an ordinary exception. 
𝟑- 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 
Your program needs to know if a late variable has been initialized or not. For this, the compiler frequently creates a retired internal variable that takes memory. 
𝟒- 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 ‘ 𝐢𝐟 ’ 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 
Every time you read a late variable the program must insure it&#x27;s initialized, so a redundant check is added. 
𝟓- 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞.
Every time you write to a late variable the program sets the internal flag to note that it&#x27;s initialized. 
Hopefully, that helped. Did it? 😃

                              <span>Often when debugging, we need to step outside of the comforting embrace of the IDE to reproduce or track an issue. In this series, I’d like to go over some tools you might find useful for these cases. I’ll try to limit myself to tools that are 100% debugging tools and not those that are useful for development testing.
E.g. tools like curl or jq are remarkably useful. You can/should use them while debugging. But you probably used them while building and testing the feature. So you would already be familiar with them and should have some sense of what they do. I want to focus on tools that you would mostly reach for when debugging. In that sense, tools like SDKMan etc. also make no sense here.
I also want to avoid tools like the database tools. They are remarkably useful when debugging, but …</span>

                              <span>In this article, you will learn about the increment operator ++ and the decrement operator -- .
In programming (Java, C, C++, JavaScript etc.), the increment operator ++ decrement operator -- are used.
Increment operator (++) or Decrement operator (--) --&gt; This operators increase the value of variable by 1 or decrease the variable by 1.
int a &#x3D; 5;
a++; //output will be 6
int b &#x3D; 5;
a--; //output will be 4

These operators are further divided into 
1) Prefix increment/decrement operator --&gt; The ++ and -- are placed before number, first evaluate the value and then performs the work.
int a &#x3D; 5;

System.out.println(++a); // here the new value is evaluated that is + so value will be 6 and output will be 6

System.out.println(a);   // output will be 6 because there is no further work to perform.…</span>

Just as a reminder, with this topic we will be able to make our Labeled Range Slider draggable.

To keep it simple we will create a Scribble Composable, to explore how we can handle touch interactions.

For a regular interactive Composable we would normally use either the Modifier clickable:
Canvas(
   modifier &#x3D; Modifier.clickable {
      Log.i(&quot;Tag&quot;, &quot;Canvas clicked&quot;)
   }
) {
   // draw something

or the experimental combinedClickable:

Web development, generally referred to as website development, describes the activities involved in developing, constructing, and managing websites and web applications that are used to access info on the internet through a browser.  It might also include database management, website development, and web design. Web development and the task of creating the features and functionality of apps are closely related (web design). Development often refers to the process of actually building these things (that is to say, the programming of sites). HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are the primary computer languages used.

However, they are hard to work with in many aspects and have a lot of legacy choices - such as everything being region locked. Google cloud is often seen as the most developer friendly and a great choice if you don&#x27;t want spend hours banging your head against the wall. Azure also offers great developer experience but it&#x27;s less reliable in my experience.
Since we work very closely with the 3 major clouds to develop our product - Multy - I have written a blog post on what I have learned about the differences in Virtual Machines in AWS, Azure and GCP.
The blog post goes over:
Regions and availability zones
Virtual machine types and sizes
SSH access and default users
Virtual machine images
Block storage and disk

                              <span>Did you mess ever with any algorithm that you need in your project? Many times we need to implement an Algorithm for our program to fulfil all the business logic. So Algorithm is a major part of a software or application that defines all the business logic
I started development in 2014. My first project was on Multi-Level Marketing binary Structure also called MLM Binary 1x2.
That was not easy for me to create the Tree logics that will generate dynamically.

It was hard for me to develop all the logic behind that tree with  lots of condition.
In 2014 there was no content on the Internet on how to build complex logic like MLM Binary 1x2. So I deeply did the experiments for almost 30 days. Then finally, I got a solution. I built that web application and provided it to the client. 
The client was so happy because at that time there were very few developers who can do this. And the client ran the project for almost 2 years and earned a lot of money.
So after learning those complex logic, I was thinking other developers in the world facing the same issue. So I started a YouTube channel and told other developers how I build this.

  8 Years in developing Algorithms


So I did not stop here to create complex logic. Then I worked for many Software companies to build complex logic for them. I invested my 8 years to just creating logic. 
I think the journey in complex algorithm development will never end. Every day I learn new things and get more ideas. I still enjoy to develop Algorithms.
Creating Algorithms is an Art</span>

Preparation
First, we need to create a Node.js* project and add npm packages puppeteer, puppeteer-extra and puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to control Chromium (or Chrome, or Firefox, but now we work only with Chromium which is used by default) over the DevTools Protocol in headless or non-headless mode. 
To do this, in the directory with our project, open the command line and enter npm init -y, and then npm i puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth.
*If you don&#x27;t have Node.js installed, you can download it from nodejs.org and follow the installation documentation.
📌Note: also, you can use puppeteer without any extensions, but I strongly recommended use it with puppeteer-extra with puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to prevent website detection that you a…</span>

                              <span>The term &quot;Application Program Interface&quot; first appeared in a paper called Data structures and techniques for remote computer graphics presented at an AFIPS (American Federation of Information Processing Societies) conference in 1968. It was used to describe the interaction of an application with the rest of the computer system.
In 1974, API was introduced in a paper called The Relational and Network Approaches: Comparison of the Application Programming Interface. APIs then became part of the ANSI/SPARC framework. It&#x27;s an abstract design standard for DBMS (Database Management Systems) proposed in 1975. 
By 1990, the API was defined simply as a set of services available to a programmer for performing certain tasks. As Computer Networks became common in the 1970s and 1980s, programmers wanted…</span>

Linktree, a popular “link in bio” service, is launching a mobile app on iOS and Android, the company announced on Tuesday. Previously, you’ve had to log into Linktree through a browser on desktop or your phone to manage your profile, but if you prefer an app, that will now be an option. The “majority” of Linktree’s signups and logins from its more than 25 million users happen on a mobile device, according to a Linktree press release, so this new app could prove to be a popular choice for creators.
Link in bio services, which generally let you make a simple page with a list of all the links you want to share with the world, have become more and more popular among creators in recent years. Social networks like Instagram and TikTok only let...

Optics and imaging giant Nikon will stop making new single lens reflex cameras — once the technological mainstay of professional photography — according to a report from Nikkei. 
The death of SLR cameras has been coming for quite some time, as mirrorless alternatives have increased in image quality while offering consumers the option to use lighter and smaller products. 
According to Nikkei, Nikon will continue to produce and distribute its existing SLR models, but will focus development of new models entirely on mirrorless. Nikkei notes that Nikon’s SLR cameras were “widely used by professional cameramen for more than 60 years and have come to be seen as synonymous with the Japanese company.”
Nikon will continue to sell existing DSLR...

We’re on the cusp of a new generation of wireless headphones that are more power-efficient, sound better, and support novel new features like being able to connect an “unlimited” number of devices to a single source. That’s thanks to Bluetooth LE Audio, an umbrella term for a collection of new features for Bluetooth devices that the Bluetooth standards body is officially announcing the completion of today.
Bluetooth LE Audio was announced way back at the beginning of 2020, and the Bluetooth SIG had originally hoped that supporting devices would be released before the end of that year. But, after a significant delay due to the pandemic, the completion of the specification today means that manufacturers can now start adding support for the...

The original Dash Cart launched in 2020 and Amazon has been slowly rolling them out (ho ho) to its Fresh grocery stores and Whole Foods Market stores. It’s clear they’re still a bit of an experiment, though, and Amazon says the new Dash Cart will only be available at its Westford, Massachusetts Whole Foods store some time “in the coming months,” before slowly heading to other Fresh and Whole Foods locations across the US.
The cart’s main feature is a sensor array in the rim that uses AI-powered cameras and barcode scanners to identify whatever you put in (or...

HMD has announced a trio of new Nokia feature phones including the Nokia 5710 XpressAudio, which has a built-in charging case for an included pair of true wireless earbuds. The company is far from the first to have had this idea (check out 2019’s Servo R25 as one recent example), but it’s notable to see the form factor attempted by a more established company with global reach.
The Nokia 5710 XpressAudio looks like a regular candy bar-style feature phone from the front, with a 2.4-inch display and classic T9 keypad. But around back, there’s a charging compartment, revealed with the slide of a plastic cover. The device will retail for £74.99 (€69) and will be available in the UK in late July, though there’s no word on a US release.

Security researchers and The Drive’s Rob Stumpf have recently posted videos of themselves unlocking and remotely starting several Honda vehicles using handheld radios, despite the company’s insistence that the cars have security protections meant to stop attackers from doing that very thing. According to the researchers, this hack is made possible because of a vulnerability in the keyless entry system in many Hondas made between 2012 and 2022. They’ve dubbed the vulnerability Rolling-PWN.
The basic concept for Rolling-PWN is similar to attacks we’ve seen before used against VWs and Teslas, as well as other devices; using radio equipment, someone records a legitimate radio signal from a key fob, then broadcasts it back to the car. It’s...

Has there ever been a better day to get into Nerf? I’m having a hard time thinking of one. Two of the best, most competitive unmodded blasters cost half their normal price today — including the Dart Zone MK-3 and the Nerf Rival Perses — and I’m seeing huge discounts on a bunch of other actually-fun foam throwers as well. 
Just note that you won’t actually find most of these blasters at Amazon. Target and Walmart are holding the best blaster sales, likely in an attempt to draw focus from their competitor.

Dart Zone MK-3 for $65 (normally $130) at Target. The hobby’s never seen a stock blaster like the MK-3 before, pictured atop this story. You get semi-auto AND full-auto; short darts AND long darts; 8AAs or the option of a drop-in...

近 10 年的老台式机，性能是较弱了，但干一般的活都很够用，暂时不想更换。
安装有 VirtualBox ，跑 win7 很流畅，然而跑 Ubuntu 非常卡顿。
在网上搜到这个： https://www.blackdown.org/best-linux-distros-for-virtualbox/，但其一的 Lubuntu 的下载链接居然错的，看来其维护不是太好，似乎也是个人在维护。
那么请教一下，不想折腾，只是普通开发需用一下 Linux 环境，这老台式机的 VirtualBox 跑哪个 Linux 发行版较为流畅？
暂不考虑 WSL ，一是没有图形界面，二是 VirtualBox 与 WSL 冲突，需要在 BIOS 去开或关那个 hyper-v 设置，由于常需 VirtualBox 跑 win7 ，有点麻烦。</span>

原文内容是
PrimaryExpr &#x3D;
Operand |
Conversion |
MethodExpr |
PrimaryExpr Selector |
PrimaryExpr Index |
PrimaryExpr Slice |
PrimaryExpr TypeAssertion |
PrimaryExpr Arguments .

Selector       &#x3D; &quot;.&quot; identifier .
Index          &#x3D; &quot;[&quot; Expression &quot;]&quot; .
Slice          &#x3D; &quot;[&quot; [ Expression ] &quot;:&quot; [ Expression ] &quot;]&quot; |
                 &quot;[&quot; [ Expression ] &quot;:&quot; Expression &quot;:&quot; Expression &quot;]&quot; .
TypeAssertion  &#x3D; &quot;.&quot; &quot;(&quot; Type &quot;)&quot; .
Arguments      &#x3D; &quot;(&quot; [ ( ExpressionList | Type [ &quot;,&quot; ExpressionList ] ) [ &quot;...&quot; ] [ &quot;,&quot; ] ] &quot;)&quot; .

其中我关心的是 Arguments 的定义，它表示为 ( ExpressionList | Type [ &quot;,&quot; ExpressionList ] )
ExpressionList 很容易理解，它可以匹配 (1,2,string(1)) 这样的文本，但是 Type [ExpressionList] 怎么理解呢，我从来没见过在 go 里可以写 var v &#x3D; func_call(TypeName) 这样的表达式
（在上面引用的文本中，[ ] 包裹的内容表示为可选, | 表示匹配其中一个）</span>

昨天还在为 WPS 辩护，觉得分享被审核很正常，这个逻辑主要是因为自己经常打开网盘的公开分享链接，后来一想，我把文档分享给我的同事、亲人、朋友，你凭什么偷看？ 我分享只是一个投递的过程，又不是公开的过程
鉴于目前的大环境，也不排除国家正当的要求（譬如下面的英国），金山还是要在用户隐私和监管做平衡，譬如访问很少的链接就不要去扫描，访问很多又可能造成公共事件的再去扫描审核，这样是不是可以取得平衡？
网上的新闻：
根据最新修订的英国数字安全立法，可能要求 WhatsApp 等高度加密的消息服务采用尖端技术来发现儿童性虐待材料，否则会面临巨额罚款。在线安全法案的修正案将要求科技公司“尽最大努力”部署新技术，以识别和删除儿童性虐待和剥削内容 (CSAE)。
根据提议的修正案，Ofcom 监管机构将能够要求科技公司部署或开发新技术，以帮助发现滥用材料并阻止其传播。该修正案收紧了法案中的现有条款，该条款已经赋予 Ofcom 要求部署“认可技术”的权力。如果现有技术不适合他们的平台，现在的变化将要求公司使用他们的“最大努力”来部署或开发“新”技术。</span>

在阿 B 上看到某个大 V 做的对比 spring 和 quarkus 的视频
Java 抗 Go 急先锋！？ Quarkus 很优秀，但我不会碰它！
由于怀疑他引用文章的测试方式, 这两天简单的测试了一下两者性能差别.
技术栈分别是
spring-boot + webmvc + kotlin + gradle(kotlin)
spring-boot + webflux + kotlin + gradle(kotlin)
quarkus + resteasy + kotlin + gradle(kotlin)
quarkus + resteasy-reactive + kotlin + gradle(kotlin)
响应内容
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: text/plain;charset&#x3D;UTF-8

Hello

测试代码
classic 直接返回 Hello
reactive 返回 Uni.createFrom().item(&quot;Hello&quot;) 和 Mono.just(&quot;Hello&quot;)

测试环境
cpu i5 10400
内存 ddr4 2666mhz 16G*2
测试命令 
wrk -t 10 -c50 -d60s http://localhost:8080/hello
结果
JVM 测试
测试内容
spring-classic
spring-reactive
quarkus-classic
quarkus-reactive

If you&#x27;re reading this article from home, you are probably connected with a LTE/5G/DSL/WIFI router. Such devices are usually responsible to route packets between your local devices (smartphone, PC, TV, and so on) and provide access to the world wide web through a built-in modem. Your router at home has most likely a web-based interface for configuration purposes. Such interfaces are often oversimplified as they are made for casual users.
If you want more configuration options, but don&#x27;t want to spend for a professional device you should take a look at an alternative firmware such as OpenWrt.

An application written using programming languages like C and C++ requires you to program the destruction of objects in memory when they&#x27;re no longer needed. The more your application grows, the great the probability that you&#x27;ll overlook releasing unused objects. This leads to a memory leak and eventually the system memory gets used up, and at some point there&#x27;s no further memory to allocate. This results in a situation where the application fails with an OutOfMemoryError. But in the case of Java, Garbage Collection (GC) happens automatically during application execution, so it alleviates the task of manual deallocation and possible memory leaks.

GameStop is seemingly ignoring that whole ”crypto winter” thing and moving ahead with the launch of its own NFT marketplace, which is now open in what the company calls a “public beta.” 
Right now, you can use the platform to buy, sell, and create NFTs. There are more than 200 collections you can peruse and more than 53,000 NFTs listed on the marketplace. The art I’ve seen seems to be pretty standard NFT fare — in just a few minutes of perusing, I’ve already spotted some some weird cat and monkey-themed collections, for example. Unsurprisingly, you can connect the newly-launched GameStop Wallet to manage your digital assets, though you can also use options like WalletConnect and MetaMask. And not just anyone can create an NFT on the...

Where in the world are Su Zhu and Kyle Davies? The founders of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) are nowhere to be found, according to officials charged with liquidating the bankrupt company (via Reuters). According to a court document filed Friday, Zhu and Davies’ whereabouts are currently unknown, and its liquidators say they have not received “any meaningful cooperation” from the two.
The Singapore-based 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy earlier this month, a move designed to protect foreign companies’ assets from creditors in the US. News of the bankruptcy filing surfaced after 3AC defaulted on a $670 million loan provided by crypto broker Voyager Digital, which has since filed for bankruptcy as well. 3AC...

It’s a major moment for the telescope, signaling the beginning of scientific operations for the mission that could fundamentally transform astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe.
The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, sports the largest mirror we’ve ever sent into space, spanning more than 21 feet across. Made out of gold-plated beryllium, the mirror is designed to gather infrared light — a type of light invisible to the human eye that can travel incredibly long distances across the Universe. Equipped with this impressive mirror, JWST...

一个应用的好快可以用四个字来概括，即“用户体验”
一、用户体验
用户体验（User Experience，简称UE/UX）是用户在使用产品过程中建立起来的一种纯主观感受。但是对于一个界定明确的用户群体来讲，其用户体验的共性是能够经由良好设计实验来认识到。计算机技术和互联网的发展，使技术创新形态正在发生转变，以用户为中心、以人为本越来越得到重视，用户体验也因此被称做创新2.0模式的精髓。在中国面向知识社会的创新2.0——应用创新园区模式探索中，更将用户体验作为“三验”创新机制之首。 ISO 9241-210标准将用户体验定义为 “人们对于针对使用或期望使用的产品、系统或者服务的认知印象和回应”。通俗来讲就是“这个东西好不好用，用起来方不方便”。因此，用户体验是主观的，且其注重实际应用时的产生的效果。 ISO定义的补充说明有着如下解释：用户体验，即用户在使用一个产品或系统之前、使用期间和使用之后的全部感受，包括情感、信仰、喜好、认知印象、生理和心理反应、行为和成就等各个方面。该说明还列出三个影响用户体验的因素：系统，用户和使用环境。
然而，所有的用户体验的前提是使用产品
使用产品的第一个要点就是启动速度，这也是所有产品一直追求启动优化的原因。
在建立分位制，用标准去量化优化效果 一文中，我列举出了很多启动优化的优化项，这也是应用层开发常使用的优化手段；
二、变异的常规优化
使用上述的一些常规优化之后，还能不能提升启动速度呢？答案是可以的，做法就是在空间和时间上做一些调整，其中最为卓著的就是 “有向无环图启动器”
2.1 有向无环图启动器解析
首先，他的作者也是通过常规优化的手段切入，然后将启动项分成了很多单独的任务，最后利用有向无环图这个数据结构将任务的调度进行了先后顺序的排列，从而加快了启动速度。

                              <span>1. 背景
在Flutter Test官方的CI方案中，包含UnitTest/WidgetTest/DriverTest三种模式，其中UnitTest/WidgetTest是可以在代码的沙盒环境下运行，而Driver Test需要依赖整包构建；大家都知道在单元测试过程中发现问题成本最低，而整包构建耗时比较久，因此这里介绍一种通用的Flutter Test在CI阶段的方案；
Flutter CI自动化检测能力主要通过FlutterTest能力建设，但具体数据能力建设稍有不足，主要原因是
FlutterTest不支持直接发送一个http请求功能；
以及大量的Channel数据需要主动MOCK，如果大型应用需要mock的太多太杂；
同理可以看在stackoverflow上也有很多人咨询过为什么flutter test环境下无法运行一个HTTP服务请求；
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62184160/flutter-testing-passing-an-actual-http-client-instead-of-a-mocked-one
其实分析主要原因是一个在Flutter Test的沙盒环境下，无法运行engine侧很多代码，导致socket服务不能正常发，因此在CI下网络服务是断开的；鉴于此很多mock服务比如flutter mockite就提供一种方案自己维护mock数据，但是这种方式维护成本就非常高了，大家都是程序员，谁也不愿意去维护mock数据，何况业务天天变动情况下；
分析下其思路主要是通过setupMockHttpOverrides覆盖全局的Http，然后将请求服务转接到mock处理逻辑中；
void setupMockHttpOverrides() {

有一天你正在王者团战里杀的热火朝天，忽然公司测试人员打你电话问为什么某个功能数据展示不出来了，昨天还好好的纳，是不是你又偷偷写bug了。。。WTF!，你会说你把手机给我，我连上电脑看看打印的请求日志是不是接口有问题，然后吭哧吭哧搞半天看到接口数据返回的格式确实不会，然后去群里丢了几句服务端人员看一下这个接口，数据有问题。然后有回去打游戏，可惜游戏早已结束，以失败告终，自己还没无情的举报禁赛了。。。人生最痛苦的事莫过于如此。假如你的项目已经继承了抓包助手，并且也给其他人员较少过如何使用，那么像这类问题根本就不需要你再来处理了，遇到数据问题他们第一时间会自己看请求数据，而你就可以安心上王者了。

目前常见的抓包工具有Charles、Fiddler、Wireshark等，这些或多或少都需要一些配置，略显麻烦，只适合开发及测试人员玩，如果产品也想看数据怎么办纳，别急，本文的主角登场了，你可以在项目中集成AndroidMonitor，只需两步简单配置即可实现抓包数据可视化功能，随时随地，人人都可以方便快捷的查看。
三、效果展示
俗话说无图无真相




四、如何使用
抓包工具有两个依赖需要添加：monito和monitor-plugin
Demo下载体验
1、monitor接入
添加依赖
   debugImplementation &#x27;io.github.lygttpod:monitor:0.0.4&#x27;

-备注： 使用debugImplementation是为了只在测试环境中引入
2、monitor-plugin接入
根目录build.gradle下添加如下依赖
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            ......
            //monitor-plugin需要

                              <span>Dating back to the Vikings, ryijy is a distinctly Finnish textile tradition that produces thick, high-pile tapestries and rugs. The heavily patterned works, which have shifted from functional to decorative, are made by hand-knotting wool and layering the yarn into lush, textured motifs.
Drawing on her background in textile design, Finnish artist Marianne Huotari translates this technique into ceramics, creating densely delicate reliefs that evoke the depth and dimension of fiber. Huotari begins every work with a color palette and surface, whether in the form of a wall-based piece or a freestanding sculpture. More</span>

Minimal in form and lush in construction, the creatures include a dandelion-headed brontosaurus, a stegosaurus with spiky raspberry leaves defining its back, and a velociraptor laced with forget-me-nots.

                              <span>一、写在前面
北漂快两年整了，经历了一次搬家，换了两次居住环境，这次由于租房合同到期、房东涨价以及疫情小区封控，因此打算换个居住环境。
我对租房的观念一直是这不仅仅只是一个睡觉的地方。不是白天在格子间当了一天社畜，晚上下班回来就只是睡个觉。我觉得租房更多的是在漂泊的城市拥有一个属于自己的家。之前在网上看到一句话很赞同：「你的生活质量也决定着你的生活状态，塑造自己的生活标准，并创造一个优雅、舒适的独处时光吧。」
其实我觉得租房还挺简单的，无非是在通勤、合租还是整租、房租这三个主要因素之间找到平衡。钱到位，什么都不是问题，三环里整租一套也不是梦，所以还是要多赚钱。预算不足的话，只能选择牺牲点什么换取相对优势了。比如我去年租的房就是牺牲了通勤（一天通勤总时长为 2h），但是整租了一套郊区 60 平的一居室大房子，要多舒服有多舒服。
去年找房很顺利，前期准备比较充足，从网上浏览了大量的租房经验帖，再加上好朋友 90 的帮忙，跟着中介只看了一套房就定下了。然后就和 90、阮哥成为了邻居，邻居日常送温暖，搬家最舍不得就是中国好邻居和他们的大金毛了。

二、个人情况
虽然自己房子七月初才到期，但担心疫情又居家隔离不能及时线下看房，加上自己不想拖到后面焦虑，所以我从 6 月初就开始在租房平台上看房，然后挑了个周末线下看了一下午房，一周时间就确定了要租的房子。
因为之前独居一年，经历过三次居家隔离，最长的一次一个月都没有人和我说话，再加上房租涨价，让我这次考虑了合租而不是整租。还有一点是自己整租一居室，发现实际利用率比较高的也就卧室和书桌，而客厅沙发、电视机一年没用过几次，因为公司管三餐所以工作日也不自己做饭，厨房利用率也很低，因此感觉自己整租一居室有点奢侈。而且这次是打算搬到三环、四环附近，之前住郊区五环外进城一趟还是有点麻烦，路上花的时间较多。加上自己并不喜欢自如这种统一的装修风格，也不…</span>

                              <span>前言
在钢笔市场，最能被大家接受的价位在几十块到小几百之间，价位中覆盖了主流的日德钢尖钢笔和少部分入门的14K金笔，从书写体验而言，这些产品已经可以让大家体验到现代钢笔的使用效果，并且相当稳定。
在海外品牌中，日本钢笔是对于初涉钢笔的爱好者们最为友好的产品了，大众款的笔迹细，搭配合适的墨水和纸张，能做到类似中性笔的粗细效果，在新手看重的顺滑度属性方面，日产钢笔也做得相对不错，符合新人对于钢笔的期待。
趣味文具箱整理了1000~3000日元、5000~10000日元、10000日元+三个价位，2022年在日本文具店受欢迎的日本品牌钢笔，下文来看看这些流行的大众款钢笔！
3000日元以下的严选推荐-实用的日本产钢笔

本国生产的钢笔一直是稳定和安心的代名词，2022年，白领们有了在办公室使用钢笔的新风向，大家都希望买到的钢笔有好看的笔杆，尽量不要有廉价感，也只是混在文具盒中，和其它笔类放在一起，预算就是3000日元以下。
目前此定位下最火热的钢笔就是百乐【LIGHTIVE】，型号就是百乐将LIGHT和ACTIVE结合而成创造的一个词汇，设计理念是兼具外观设计性和功能性，方便好用的钢笔，主要的客单目标就是首次在办公室尝试实用钢笔的30~40岁区间的白领们。笔帽内有全新设计的防干盖，可以减少墨水挥发干尖的情况。整笔重量仅仅是12g，非常轻巧，随身携带，大量书写，记录都很合适。在日本的售价是2000日元，价格相当有竞争力。
LIGHTIVE的笔尖和百乐佩尔娜是同款，百乐宣传是特殊合金工艺，有F尖、M尖两个不同的粗细。
笔帽内部设计了防干内帽，相当于白金的滑封气帽技术，但白金专利是内部有弹簧，这个双重帽可以减少笔尖干尖的情况。
笔杆是树脂，漆面装饰，金属件镀黑处理，外观看起来是相当时尚。

在日本上市的这个LIGHTIVE，其实早在19年就在我国上市了，型号叫做冒险者，EXPLORER…</span>

马斯克曾多次公开表示，他希望知道有多少推特账户是由机器人运营的，因为他觉得可疑账户的数量影响了公司的价值。因此他寻求检测和处理虚假账户的方法。当推特最终提供了马斯克明确要求的 8 个开发者 API 的访问权时，这些 API 的速率限制低于推特向其最大企业客户提供的速率限制。马斯克称，这使得他们无法在任何合理的时间内完成数据分析。

许多老的 X.Org 组件在本周末有新的发布

上周末，Oracle 的长期 X.Org 贡献者 Alan Coopersmith 对各种旧的、很少维护的 X.Org 项目发布了许多新的更新。这些软件多年来没有任何更新，新的版本大多只是收集了过去几年中的一些随机修复。总的来说，这些更新并没有什么值得兴奋的改进。

如果你计划永久的转移到 Linux 系统上，你应该会很高兴地知道在 Linux 上有数以千计的能与商业或付费应用媲美的应用。如果你是第一次使用 Linux 的 Windows 用户，你可能都没有听说过这些应用。

因此，在这一系列文章中，我们每一篇重点介绍一组 Ubuntu 应用，以增加 Linux 用户们的协作和认识。

这是 Ubuntu 应用程序系列的第二篇文章，如果你错过了其他部分，可以在这里阅读：


第一篇


1、OBS Studio

第一个应用是著名的 流媒体应用 —— OBS Studio 。这是一款自由开源的应用，主要用于互联网上的流媒体应用。此外，你可以使用该应用创建一个复杂的流媒体项目，包括多源、覆盖式横幅等功能。

而且，由于它能够支持“实时消息传输协议Real-Time Messaging Protocol”（RTMP），你可以使用它在 Facebook、Youtube、Twitch 以及其他支持的平台上进行流式传输。

这个有十年历史的应用程序是 Linux 上最好的应用程序之一。



你可以在 OBS Studio 官网 了解更多的信息并下载，或者通过以下方式安装。

通过 PPA 在 Ubuntu 和相关发行版上安装：

sudo add-apt-repository ppabsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt update
sudo apt install obs-studio


如果你希望通过 Flatpak 安装 ，首先 为 Flatpak 设置系统 然后 通过这个页面安装 。

在 Arch Linux 或者其他 Linux 版本，访问 此页面 了解。

2、Inkscape

                              <span>前几天我试图安装 massCode 应用。对于安装，它提供了一个 Snap 文件以供下载。

当我尝试从 Snap 文件安装应用程序时：

sudo snap install snap_file


它给了我以下错误：

error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap &quot;masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap&quot;




这很奇怪。在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 时，你必须添加 GPG 密钥。但是这里的开发人员没有提供这样的东西。

“修复”简单易行。让我给你解释一下。

处理 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 错误

这里其实不涉及签名。

发生的情况是你从第三方下载了 Snap 安装程序。 Ubuntu 中的 Snap 机制希望你从官方 Snap 商店获取 Snap 包。

由于它不是来自 Snap 商店，因此你会看到 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 的错误消息。与大多数错误消息一样，这个错误消息不是描述性的。

那么，这里的解决方案是什么？

任何未通过 Snap 商店分发的 Snap 包都必须使用 --dangerous 选项进行安装。这就是规则。

sudo snap install --dangerous path_to_snap_file


这样，你告诉 Snap 包管理器显式安装 Snap 包。

在这里，我使用了这个选项并且能够成功地从它的 Snap 包中安装 massCode。



以这种方式安装 Snap 包有多“危险”？几乎和下载并 安装 deb 格式安装包 相同。

在我看来，如果你是从项目开发者的网站上下载 Snap 包，你已经在信任该项目了。在这种情况下，你可以使用 --dangerous 选项安装它。

当然，你应该首先搜索该软件包是否在 Snap 商店中可用：

snap find package_name


我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你修复 Snap 错误。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。如果你想了解更多信息，请参阅 这个使用 Snap 命令指南。

使用的组件 TabLayout ViewPager NestScrollView RecyclerView
主要实现
首先我们要自定义一个我 ScrollView 继承自 NestedScrollView，重写 onMeasure 方法，在这个方法中我们获取 scrollview 可以滚动的最大距离，再重新 onNestedPreScroll 方法，在这里面去判断是否先消费子级的滚动。下面是主要代码展示
public class MyScrollView extends NestedScrollView {

    private final String TAG &#x3D; &quot;MyScrollView&quot;;

    private int maxScrollHeight;

    public MyScrollView(Context context) {
        super(context);
    }

    public MyScrollView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    public MyScrollView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) {
        super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
        super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);

        //获取scrollView 最大可滚动的距离
        maxScrollHeight &#x3D; this.getChildAt(0).getMeasuredHeight() - this.getMeasuredHeight();
    }


    @Override
    public void onNestedPreScroll(@NonNull View target, int dx, int dy, @NonNull int[] consumed,
                                  int type) {

        super.onNestedPreScroll(target, dx, dy, consumed, type);

        //如果最大可滚动距离大于 0 则表示 scrollview 可以滚动，则去先消费用户滑动
        if(this.maxScrollHeight &gt; 0){
            //判断用户是否是向上滑动，并且没有超出 scrollview 可滑动的最大距离
            boolean headerScrollUp &#x3D; dy &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; getScrollY()  0;

            //如果 scrollview 可以滑动，则去消费滑动
            if (headerScrollUp || headerScrollDown) {
                scrollBy(0, dy);
                consumed[1] &#x3D; dy;
            }
            //通知子列表，父级消费的距离
            this.dispatchNestedPreScroll(dx, dy, consumed, null, type);
        }
    }
}

接着我们需要将 tab view 的内容高的设置为整个屏幕高度，这样我们在往上滚动的时候，最后就会只剩下 tab 的内容。下面是主要代码展示。
//动态设置外层布局的高度，让整个 tab 页为屏幕高度
LinearLayout linearLayout &#x3D; this.findViewById(R.id.linearLayout);
LinearLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams &#x3D; new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, height);
linearLayout.setLayoutParams(layoutParams);

前言
本篇文章是《Android开发艺术探索》第8章的理解和实践，该篇文章涉及的源码知识点较多，来逐一分解。
为什么会突然想了解一下Window呢，原因有如下2个：
一个是在Android View工作原理的探索时有提及到ViewRootImpl这个类，当时说的是该类负责View的测量、布局和绘制，那这个ViewRootImpl的来由是什么，为什么是它来负责绘制；
一个是我们经常使用Dialog、PopupWindow等弹窗，同时设置其Window属性，但是这些有什么区别，各种Window的属性又是啥。
而这俩个原因，从某种程度上说就说明了为什么Android需要设计出这个Window。这里我们先说一些概念和设计原则，再来一一通过实践和源码来理解。

其实关于Window的知识点比较多，这里我们先说概念，先有一个总体的认识，这样比较方便理解。
一些概念
首先，Window表示是一个窗口的概念，在大屏的电脑屏幕上我们比较好理解，我打开一个应用，就是一个窗口，在Android中是一个应用定义为一个窗口还是一个Dialog就定义为一个窗口呢，真实情况如何。
Window和View的关系
这和我们普通的认知是不一样的，在Android中Window是一个抽象的概念，Android所有的视图都是通过Window来呈现，不论是Activity、Dialog还是Toast，视图实际都可以看成是附加在window上，即Window是View的载体。
这里如何理解呢 我们看到的EditText、ImageView等…</span>

原文链接：The Dark Secrets of Fast Compilation for Kotlin
前言
快速编译大量代码一向是一个难题，尤其是当编译器必须执行很多复杂操作时，例如重载方法解析和泛型类型推断。 本文主要介绍在日常开发中做一些小改动时，Kotlin编译器是如何加快编译速度的
为什么编译那么耗时?
编译时间长通常有三大原因：
代码库大小：通常代码码越大，编译耗时越长
你的工具链优化了多少，这包括编译器本身和你正在使用的任何构建工具。
你的编译器有多智能：无论是在不打扰用户的情况下计算出许多事情，还是需要不断提示和样板代码
前两个因素很明显，让我们谈谈第三个因素：编译器的智能。 这通常是一个复杂的权衡，在 Kotlin 中，我们决定支持干净可读的类型安全代码。这意味着编译器必须非常智能，因为我们在编译期需要做很多工作。
Kotlin 旨在用于项目寿命长、规模大且涉及大量人员的工业开发环境。
因此，我们希望静态类型安全，能够及早发现错误，并获得精确的提示（支持自动补全、重构和在 IDE 中查找使用、精确的代码导航等）。
然后，我们还想要干净可读的代码，没有不必要的噪音。这意味着我们不希望代码中到处都是类型。 这就是为什么我们有支持 lambda 和扩展函数类型的智能类型推断和重载解析算法等等。 Kotlin 编译器会自己计算出很多东西，以同时保持代码干净和类型安全。
编译器可以同时智能与高效吗?
为了让智能编译器快速运行，您当然需要优化工具链的每一部分，这是我们一直在努力的事情。 除此之外，我们正在开发新一代 Kotlin 编译器，它的运行速度将比当前编译器快得多，但这篇文章不是关于这个的。
不管编译器有多快，在大型项目上都不会太快。 而且，在调试时所做的每一个小改动都重新编译整个代码…</span>

引子
线上 App 某个版本之后，服务端同学从埋点数据中发现一个奇怪的现象：“所有界面的 Activity.onPause() 过后，得等 10 秒整，才回调 Activity.onStop()。”
这么扯吗？是不是统计数据有问题？
怎么可能？Activity 生命周期是系统控制的呀？
为啥是如此诡异，正正好好的 10 秒？
App 岂不是会很卡？ANR 蹭蹭往上？
从哪切入排查？
接手该问题后，一连串问号涌现。。。
检测 &amp; 复现
在一口闷三杯咖啡之后，我决定。。先上个厕所。（咖啡利尿）
定神之后，我做出了一个关键决定：先稳定复现问题。这是修复任何问题的第一步。
于是乎写出了这样的检测代码：
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
       super.onCreate()
       registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(object : ActivityLifecycleCallbacks {
           override fun onActivityPaused(activity: Activity) {
               val now &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis()
               Log.v(&quot;test&quot;, 
                   &quot;Pause(${activity.componentName})${now.milliseconds.inWholeSeconds}&quot;

去年7月份我发布了 《维护两个10k+Star的Github项目，会遇到什么有趣的问题》 的相关吐槽，当时 JYM 看得还是挺乐呵的，时隔一年之后，让我们来看看又有什么充满“智慧”的问题，为你展示真实高 Star 开源项目维护者的心路历程。
注意⚠️：阅读本文可能会浪费您宝贵的 5 分钟，本篇主要是吐槽和分享过去一年维护 Github 项目以来的一些有趣的经历，所以阅读本文并不会增长你的技术，但是如果你想做开源，想了解开源项目维护者的心理，那可能会给你带来一些启发😊。
其实参与开源这么多年，相信大家都有所体会，特别是 Android 开发，在经历了曾经 Android 开源的辉煌时代之后，如今还在坚持的人真的不多，不说还维护开源项目，就说还在单纯从事 Android 开发的也不多了，从  AndroidGithubBoss 项目的统计上看，排名前 10 还在维护的纯 Android 开源项目寥寥无几，可以看到几乎都是金色的 Deprecated 状态。

为什么呢？首先是现在的 Android 项目获取流量的能力已经大幅度下降，官方 Jetpack 体系的成熟也挤压了第三方开源项目的市场。
另外，虽然做开源项目至今也有 7 年了，但是每次打开 Github 的通知中心，看到这样的场景时都难免会心颤一下，因为对于个人开源维护者来说，Github 的小蓝点有时候就像是“催命符“，有时候可能都很急，在等着救命。

个人开源项目的优势就是灵活，当你需要什么东西，可以让维护者快速更新发布；但是缺点也是很明显，就是个人的精力和时间十分有限。
有时候用户着急的情绪会体现在标题上，但是其实当我看到  issue 时可能已经是隔天了，而事实上很多 issue 如果对方能稍微花点时间，看看文档或者 issue 模版上的链接，我想可能都不需要等我的回复。

来自俄罗斯的 Astra Linux 是 Debian 的下游发行版，它已经存在了一些年，除了 x86、Arm 等 CPU 架构外，它还支持 MIPS 架构。它是由 RusBITech 开发的，是专门为俄罗斯军队设计的。微软已经阻止了 Windows 在俄罗斯的使用，这似乎大大有助于推动替代操作系统的采用。路透社报道说，RosBITech 正计划在莫斯科证券交易所上市，估值约折合为 2.6 亿美元。

老王点评：我觉得他们比较谦虚，要是搞个根社区可能估值更高呢。




KDE Plasma 5.26 有望使用 C++20 进行开发

在即将到来的 KDE Plasma 5.26 桌面环境中，KDE 开发者正考虑使用 C++20 语言开发后续功能，尤其是使用 C++ 协同例程支持特性。随着时间的推移，这种较新的 C++ 语言也会用于其他 KDE 组件。将 C++ 要求提升到 C++20 意味着将 KDE 编译器要求提高到 GCC 10 或 Clang 11，而这些版本的编译器已经稳定发布两年了。

老王点评：看来最近各个开源项目都在逐渐迁移到新的语言标准和新的编译器了，这种稳健而进步的态度是开源的生命力。




RISC-V 仅用 12 年达成百亿核心里程碑

在近日召开的 Embedded World 大会上，RISC-V 国际的 CEO 宣布目前 RISC-V 市场上的核心数量已经突破 100 亿。CEO 认为开放标准是关键，“Linux 在为软件所做的事情，和我们为硬件所做的事情有异曲同工之妙。”RISC-V 是一种开放标准指令集架构（ISA），根据开源许可提供。据悉，ARM 架构经过 17 年，在 2008 年实现了这个里程碑。而 RISC-V 只用了 12 年就完成了这一目标。

                              <span>学习如何用动态链接库将多个 C 目标文件结合到一个单个的可执行文件之中。




当使用 C 编程语言编写一个应用程序时，你的代码通常有多个源文件代码。

最终，这些文件必须被编译到一个单个的可执行文件之中。你可以通过创建静态或动态库（后者也被称为 共享shared 库）来实现这一点。这两种类型的库在创建和链接的方式上有所不同。两者都有缺点和优点，这取决于你的使用情况。

动态链接是最常见的方法，尤其是在 Linux 系统上。动态链接会保持库模块化，因此，很多应用程序可以共享一个库。应用程序的模块化也允许单独更新其依赖的共享库。

在这篇文章中，我将演示动态链接是如何工作的。在后期的文章中，我将演示静态链接。

链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的数个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名为可执行文件executable的可以运行的程序。在你创建一个动态链接的可执行文件前，你需要一些用来链接的库，和一个用来编译的应用程序。准备好你 最喜欢的文本编辑器 并继续。

创建目标文件

首先，创建带有这些函数签名的头文件 mymath.h ：

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：

                              <span>Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。




Meta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。

现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。

（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）

Meta 试图不落下任何语言




目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。

虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。

因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。

NLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。

正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！

为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。

你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。

对社会事业的鼓励

Meta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。

项目的影响

尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。

许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。

你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？

二十万级别房车——便宜大碗，房的部分空间配置等大幅提升，但车的部分依然拉胯；
三十万级别房车——主流之选，大部分房车消费者选购房车都会考虑的一个价位，不论房的部分还是车的部分都有了实际的提升，但还是存在部分硬伤，比如房的部分不够高级、品质一般；车的部分配置较低、甚至还有手动挡；
而到了四十万这个级别，当房车厂商不用那么严苛地控制成本时，终于出现了许多够实用、够个性、有品质的房车，事实上，这也是房车车型最多的一个价位，可见放开成本的手脚后，房车市场终于可以百花齐放、各显神通。
这篇文章我们就来看看四款这个价位比较有代表性的车型。
一：通过性强、硬升顶：途酷神行太保 （指导价 39.8 万）

​
​
软升顶的房车之前介绍过几款，而硬升顶的房车市面上其实很少，其成本要远高于软升顶结构，在保温、隔热、隔音、安全性等方面都要更强。
途酷这款硬升顶皮卡房车采用五十铃D-MAX底盘，越野能力较出色；外观线条硬朗，采用黑灰配色的磨砂质感外观，升顶后全车尺寸5580x2110x2143mm，降下车顶高度为2060mm，可以通过大部分限高和地下车库。虽然是皮卡底盘，但改装成房车后行驶本上是小型旅居车手续，没有报废年限。车身箱体材料是采用三明治板，升顶为螺杆机构，可以通过遥控来控制升高高度，还能随时暂停；车门在升降过程中也能随时开合。相较于软升顶，硬升顶机构的好处是在较低时速时可以不降下顶棚，坏处是整个结构比较重，使得整车质量达到2742kg。

​
​
车身外侧有配220V电源插座的抽拉式燃气灶台，盖板可以当做操作台使用；另一侧是黑水箱装卸口、尿素加注口、220V市电充电口和储物箱。车头内部还融合了一盏野外探照灯。

底盘方面搭载1.9T柴油发动机，最大功率163马力、峰值扭矩360牛米，配备爱信6AT自动挡，标配分时四驱、定速巡…</span>

                              <span>大家好，我是噩梦飘雷~
今天为大家带来关于家庭装修过程中的网线布局，以及使用mesh组网完成全屋WiFi覆盖的实战教程，全文7000余字，建议收藏后慢慢阅读~
关注我，后续分享更多有趣的内容~
前言
通过站内大佬孜孜不倦的科普，大家已经逐步认识到，对于大平层、跃层、多层别墅等大面积的户型，想要提高家中WiFi信号的覆盖效果，实现WiFi漫游，目前有AC+AP以及MESH组网两种主流方案。
毕竟国家对无线路由器的信号发射功率进行了限制，哪怕是价格大几千的顶级路由，面对多重承重墙和复杂户型，在信号覆盖方面也是巧妇难为无米之炊。
AC+AP方案主要应用在企业级无线组网领域，虽然目前有大厂也推出了家用场景下的AC+AP方案，但是还是存在着诸如必须提前埋布网线，AP面板发热降频、整体价格较高等问题。
相比之下，MESH组网的方式，更适合家用环境。组网方案非常灵活，设置难度较小，性价比更高。特别是对于家中没有预埋网线的情况，MESH组网基本上是实现全屋WiFi覆盖和漫游的唯一选择。
以我自家为例，原本使用华硕AX86U+2个AC66U B1组合的aimesh2.0方案，其中AX86U作为主路由承担PPPOE拨号任务，AC66U B1作为MESH节点负责扩展WiFi信号的覆盖面积。
这套方案实际运行起来挺稳的，但是有个最大问题，华硕aimesh2.0技术在WiFi6和WiFi5路由器混合组网的情况下，无法使用AX86U的WiFi6 160mHz频段，难以发挥出全部性能，感觉实在是浪费。
听群里老哥说过，领势是做了30多年的老牌路由器厂商，一直是MESH技术的开拓者和领头羊，以安装和组网方便著名因此今年趁着618活动，给自家更换成了领势Velop MX2003这套WiFi6的MESH系统。
什么是MESH组网？

MESH的本意就是网状，理想状态下，MESH网络中所有的节点都可以互相连通，…</span>

                              <span>作为小米冲击高端的第 3 年、第 4 个系列，12S 系列凭借着「徕卡影像」的亮点可谓赚足了眼球。我也第一时间到小米之家把玩了真机，虽然质感有进步，但整体的感觉依然很小米，硬件设计依然没有延续性可言，好在高通这代处理器终于把功耗拿捏住了（比去年 11 Ultra 明显发热卡住好太多了）。
不过我今年依然不会选购小米旗舰，因为小米始终没有解决一个问题：R角设计。

声明：我并没有相关的从业背景，所以并不清楚更专业且准确地描述这个问题，只能从普通消费者的角度形容这个问题。如有描述错误，请见谅。

R 角设计是指什么？
R角：R是圆角， Radius，指內圆弧角或外圆弧角。在手机硬件上看 R角设计的好坏时，我会把机身弧角、屏幕弧角放在一起看，因为这本质上就是把圆角放在其他圆角里。
我们先来看看小米12S Ultra 的 R角设计：

很明显，小米12S Ultra 的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率并不连续（有曲面屏的影响），也并非同心圆的关系，两个圆角曲率处有着奇怪的「畸形」。虽然这一代比小米11 Ultra 进步很多，但观感上依然别扭。

而我眼中正确的 R 角设计，代表性的有苹果 iPhone 的全面屏机型、三星S22、谷歌 Pixel 5等，它们的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率连续，且处于同心圆的位置，看起来有秩序且耐看。苹果甚至还把这种「讲究」运用在了软件硬件的结合上，比如 iPhone 全面屏版本界面底部专属的 Dock 栏，以及 Dock 栏的图标与机身机身弧角、屏幕弧角完美呼应：
真的让人感觉十分舒适。图/ carlosnuila
值得一提的是，iPhone 12 系列回归直角边框设计后， 苹果还将该设备上运行的 iOS 版本进行了 R 角微调，即便它和  iPhone X、iPhone 11 系列都是运行同样的 iOS 系统，但机身硬件外观圆角曲率产生了变化，「执拗」的苹果就在软件上准备了两种完全不同的圆角曲率分别与不同机身外观进行更好地呼应。

R 角设计做好，意味着什么？
可能很多朋友会认为，R角的设计无关紧要，只是像我这类的人过于吹毛求疵。
我尊重这个观点，因为多数设备的 R 角设计问题确实没那么重要。比如小米12S Ultra 这款机器整体表现出众，但它硬件设计缺乏的延续性、高端旗舰缺乏的精致感等问题，远比解决 R 角设计重要得多。
但就我个人角度而言，手机是我每天接触最长的电子设备，而且这几年手机迭代升级提升有限，更换周期比以往慢了许多，所以我更在乎手机的外在形象和整体体验。
手机在进入全面屏设计以后，我觉得是一个技术革命的开始，因为它让手机屏幕需要与边框之间的边界进一步缩小，达到一种近似融合的境界。

而优秀的 R 角设计，能让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，让屏幕与外壳间连接更趋向自然，让用户不能轻易感受到边界的存在，完全沉浸其中。反观设计不太好的 R 角，即便也有全面屏设计带来的震撼观感，但日常使用时也总能轻而易举感受到屏幕与外壳两者曲率处存在着奇怪的「畸形」，让技术革命带来的沉浸感始终不够彻底。
让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，这一项看似简单的设计，背后也都蕴藏着大量的技术成本，比如 OLED 屏幕的切割和折叠、电路面板的堆叠技术、圆角处的次像素反走样渲染、严格的界面 UI 设计规范等等。
最后，我很希望后续小米能够重视 R 角的设计，早日推出更棒的旗舰产品。因为我始终觉得，手机进入全面屏时代后，手机同质化越来越严重，最美的「风景」不是莱卡蔡司等相机品牌的联名、不是越来越窄的边框、不是越来越快的快充技术、不是越拍越远的长焦，而是来自 2017 年 iPhone X 那张让人完全沉浸其中的全面屏设计宣传图：

                              <span>背景
现在Omnifocus的收集任务的方式，总体还算方便。
在mac上支持快捷键呼出小窗口快速录入，如下图所示：
Omnifocus的快捷任务窗口
在iPhone上也可以使用Quick Entry快速录入。
长按Omnifocus呼出Quick Entry
按理来说，这些入口完全足够日常的收集，但是我总感觉还差点火候，那就是不够智能。
萌发
为什么会觉得Omnifocus的任务收集方式不够智能呢？因为我自己经常和Siri互动，比如让Siri帮我安排一个日程，手机上，让Siri提醒我安排一个待办事项（可以导入到Omnifocus）。这种自然的文字或语言的交互，让我觉得非常高效和符合直觉。
让我们看看具体的演示
首先一起来看看电脑端安排一个日程
Siri自动根据输入的文字，安排日程
我们可以看到，Siri很智能就识别出了下周二的日期和时间，并帮我添加了一个日程。使用Siri交互，省去了打开日历，选择日期，输入内容的繁琐过程。
然后让我们看看移动端如何使用Siri记录待办事项
通过输入文字和Siri交互SIri完成任务到提醒事项的收集打开Omnifocus自动捕捉系统提醒事项的内容
整体链路如下：

呼出Siri，并输入你的任务
Siri自动识别日期和任务
提醒事项添加到系统中
打开Omnifocus
Omnifocus自动导入系统的提醒事项

要启用Omnifocus的捕捉功能，需要在Omnifocus中做一下简单的配置。
Omnifocus配置自动捕获提醒事项
上面两个Demo都非常好，不过关键问题来了，mac上的Omnifocus不支持导入提醒事项。有朋友可能会想，那很简单啊，手机上打开Siri录入任务，然后导入到Omnifocus同步，mac端的问题不就解决了？
如果在mac上智能录入待办事项，需要用如此冗长的链路，我会选择放弃。实际在电脑工作的时候，面对突然插入的事项，我需要快速记录。一般情况下不会那么悠闲地打开手机去分心记录。
大家都是成年人了，可以全都要吗？可以。
落地
既然全都要，那我来落地一下自己的想法吧。
这个痒点需求自然不能占用我太多时间去处理，经过最偷懒原则出发的摸索，我发现快捷指令，支持提取文本里面的日期和时间。那剩下的问题就非常简单了，我们直接花一点碎片时间写一个快捷指令出来智能收集任务到Omnifocus里面就行了。
感兴趣的朋友可以看看下图，核心原理就是用“记得”为关键字做切割，将带有时间的任务收集到Omnifocus。
写完之后我都懒得看的快捷指令详情
好的，最后让我们看看成果
打开快捷指令的Input弹窗Omnifocus中的收件箱已经安排好时间
通过编写这样的一个快捷指令，让mac端的Omnifocus增加了智能识别时间录入任务的能力。
这个只是我自己在完善Ominfocus工具使用体验的一个小思路。我相信很多的任务管理工具可能已经有很好的语音识别功能，也许你也用不上，但是了解了快捷指令可以智能提取文本中的时间，可能可以给你的工作流带来一定的帮助。
总结
在我自己的工作流沉淀过程中，我比较关心工作本身是否足够流畅且不分心。我会以此为前提去充分探索和优化。至于打磨工具本身，是一个必然会经历的过程。方法论和工具本身没有高下之分，二者不可偏废。我一直提醒自己，不要只了解方法论去盖空中楼阁，更不要在工具细节中忘了自己要去哪里。</span>

                              <span>今年第4号台风艾利于7月1日早晨8点生成，7月2日夜间通过冲绳岛，7月5日登陆日本长崎县附近，随后快速穿过日本本土，于7月6日来到本州岛偏东方向的太平洋上。
但随后，艾利并没有像一般台风那样，飞速东去消散，而是在太平洋上急停逗留了三天，期间还一度增强。我们可以看到，在年轻时秃头的它，在生命的的最后时刻竟然长出了浓密的云系。
它极有可能在7月11日前后第三次袭击日本，登陆北海道或本州北部，带来狂风暴雨。在太平洋的停滞和滞留，正是它再次调转枪口的前兆。而艾利的再次转向，正是勘察加以西、东西伯利亚东南的一个横空

为了不让文章看上去过于枯燥，笔者考虑了一下，特意增加了碎碎谈环节！自从上次这篇文章发出去后  黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！，就挺受读者欢迎的呀，收藏数大于点赞数是什么鬼，嘿嘿！从我的角度出发，本来Signal出发的目的就是想建造一个类似于安全气囊的装置，保证crash后第一时间重启恢复，达到一个应用稳定的目的，但是慢慢写着写着，发现很多crash监控平台的也是用了相同的核心原理（大部分还没开源噢），只是作用的目标不同，那么为什么不把Signal打造成一个通用的基础件呢！无论是安全气囊还是监控，其实都是上层的应用不同罢了！嗯！有了这个想法之后，给Signal补充一些日志监控逻辑，就更加完善了！所以就有了本篇文章！算是一个补充文！如果没看过黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！这篇文章的新朋友，请先阅读！（如果没有ndk开发经验也没关系，里面也不涉及很复杂的c知识）
获取堆栈
获取堆栈！可能很多新朋友看到这个就会想，这有什么难的嘛！直接new 一个Throwable获取不就可以了嘛，或者Thread.currentThread().stackTrace（kotlin）等等也可以呀！嗯！是的！我们在java层通常会有很固定的获取堆栈方式，这得益于java虚拟机的设计，也得益于java语言的设计，因为屏蔽了多平台底层的差异，我们就可以用相对统一的api去获取当前的堆栈。这个堆栈也特指java虚拟机堆栈！
但是对于native的堆栈，问题就来了！我们知道native层通常跟很多因素有关，比如链接器，编译器，还有各种库的版本，各种abi等等影响，获取一个堆栈消息，可没有那么简单，因为太多因素干扰了，这也是历史的包袱！还有对于我们android来说，android官方在对堆栈获取的方式，也是有历史变化的

前言
上一篇介绍了手势在画布上的应用，那么手势与绘制画布究竟能摩擦出怎样的火花呢，本篇文章将为你详解手游中操纵杆移动角色的的原理与实现过程。
基本思路
确定操纵杆区域，确定点击时手势响应区域，当手指滑动操纵杆时，计算出当前的手指位置与当前操纵杆圆心偏移弧度，从而确定当前角色的移动方向。接下来就一步一步实现吧。
绘制
绘制操纵杆的静态图形，玩过手游应该知道操纵杆基本构成由底部圆和手指移动圆球组成，手指移动的圆球围绕底圆进行360°旋转从而控制角色朝不同方向移动。
静态效果
操纵杆的核心是由两个圆形组成，代码也非常简单。

绘制代码：
// 底圆
canvas.drawCircle(
    Offset(0,0),
    bgR,
    _paint
      ..style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.fill
      ..color &#x3D; Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.2));
_paint.color &#x3D; color;
_paint.style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.stroke;


/// 手势小圆
canvas.drawCircle(
    Offset(0,0),
    bgR / 3,
    _paint
      ..style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.fill
      ..color &#x3D; Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.9));

添加手势交互 GestureDetector
大概思路：
当点击可触控区域，将操纵杆移动到当前手指按下的位置，移动手指，根据手指位置坐标和按下时圆心位置坐标计算偏移角度得出手指相对于底圆的坐标点，松开手指，操纵杆进行复位回到初始位置。

前言
继续我们 Flutter 绘图相关的介绍，本篇我们引入一位重量级主角 —— 灭霸。通过绘图的颜色过滤器，我们要给灭霸点颜色看看。通过本篇，你会了解到如下内容：
ColorFilter 颜色过滤器的介绍；
彩色图片转换为灰度图；
通过矩阵运算构建自定义的颜色过滤器。
ColorFilter 颜色过滤器
其实我们之前在给小姐姐的照片调个颜色滤镜有介绍过颜色滤镜，在 Flutter 中提供了一个 ColorFiltered 的组件，可以将颜色过滤器应用到其子组件上。实际上，颜色过滤器就是对一个图层的每个像素的颜色（包括透明度）进行数学运算，改变像素的颜色来实现特定的效果。数学公式如下：

在 Flutter 中，ColorFilter 类的继承自 ImageFilter，像 ImageFilter 一样，也只提供了命名构造函数，一共有四个命名构造函数，分别如下：
ColorFilter.mode(Color color, BlendMode mode)：按制定的混合模式（blend mode），将颜色混入到绘制的目标中。可以理解为图像的色值调整，我们可以用一个指定的颜色调整原图，调整的模式有很多种，具体可以查看 BlendMode 枚举。
ColorFilter.linearToSrgbGamma()：将一个 SRGB 的 gamma 曲线应用到 RGB 颜色通道中。
ColorFilter.srgbToLinearGamma()：ColorFilter.linearToSrgbGamma()的反向过程。
ColorFilter.matrix(List matrix)：应用一个矩阵做颜色变换，也就是我们上面说的矩阵，这是最通用的版…</span>

引子
小u啊，我们应用启动的时候有一段白屏，不雅观，你给整个启动图上去，给，这里是资源图片
换好了
嗯，不错不错，咦，这个小米fold怎么显示了两个logo？
啊？这。。。我来看看
是这样的，activity启动图和启动背景图标一起显示了，但是启动图片又不适配fold这种狭长的屏幕，而且下半部分由于没有背景，是透明的，所以就显示了两个图标，一个启动图标，一个启动图图片图标，请看示意图

那怎么解决呢？
有几个办法，1.让启动图拉伸，覆盖下部分区域，但是会有形变，不够优雅，2.给imageview设置一个白色背景，让它不透明，3.使用android studio的。9图片制作工具，让空白部分拉伸，内容不拉伸，非常优雅。

好，那你先试试.9图片吧
.9简介
我知道看这篇文章的朋友肯定对.9图或多或少有点了解，就简单介绍下就行
.9图可以通过设置来让图片某一部分拉伸 其他部分不拉伸 还可以控制图片里面显示内容的区域
这就是.9图的简介 够简了吧 如果想看更详细的说明可以移步谷歌官方的说明 大体上也是这意思
这个是官方的文档https://developer.android.com/studio/write/draw9patch?hl&#x3D;zh-cn



这是.9图在三种拉伸情况下的例子，纵向，横向，横纵双向。
.9图制作
网上很多文章说最简单是用as内置工具来做 但是网上文章好多都是很早的 都是老版本工具 让我们来看看这工具现在啥样

好像也不是很简单啊 这些东西做什么用的第一次看确实会很蒙，这里介绍下这个工具
Zoom：调整图形在绘制区域中的缩放级别。
Patch scale：调整图像在预览区域中的比例。
Show lock：当鼠标悬停在图形的不可绘制区域上时以直观方式呈现。
Show patches：预览绘制区域中的可拉伸图块（粉色为可拉伸图块），…</span>

Pluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。

Ubuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍

Canonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。

老王点评：总算是又进一步改善了 Snap，虽然还有一些缺陷。




Web3 项目今年前半年因黑客攻击损失超过 20 亿美元

根据一项研究报告，Web3 领域仍然受到黑客、诈骗和网络钓鱼计划的困扰，同时还面临着相对较新的威胁，如闪电贷款攻击。在今年的前六个月，Web3 项目因黑客和漏洞而损失超过 20 亿美元，超过了去年全年。此外，研究还发现，Discord 是绝大多数网络钓鱼企图的载体，这是一个信号，表明它作为 Web3 的首选社交网络仍然很受欢迎，尽管安全问题不断。

                              <span>房车生活是许多人向往的事情，不过一辆优质的房车价格不菲，而且目前房车市场也不像家用车一样可以方便地试乘试驾，因为有全国连锁4S店的房车厂屈指可数。所以当你有迈入房车生活计划的时候，不妨先挑一个假期，先租上几天玩玩，看看房车的驾驶体验和使用体验你能否接受、房车中的诸多不便你能否克服、房车生活是否真的能给你带来更多快乐。
那么最重要的问题来了：怎么租？
一：可信的房车租赁平台
首先是大家都很熟悉的携程，App首页里就有租车频道，很多热门旅游城市都有房车可以选择。​

​
 

​
​​我没在携程租过房车，但在不同城市租过十几次其他车型，总体的服务是满意的，由于有携程平台的监管，租赁公司也不太敢玩套路，而且他们普遍很在乎你在携程的评价，会尽力服务好你，有一次我还车时车身有一条很细的划痕，车商让我给个好评就不用我赔偿了。
但在下订单前最好浏览一下评论，如果差评很多可以换一家车商。
在携程租车的另一个好处是免费取消时间、不同档次的保险费用和权益都会清晰标注，可以按需选择，比如对驾驶有信息，就买个基础险，小事故需要自己理赔；如果技术一般，或者去的地方路况比较差，可以购买全险，出任何大小事故都是由车商处理，很省心。
类似的还有飞猪、马蜂窝等平台。
第二个推荐是上汽大通集团的官方房车租赁平台。
上汽大通是国内比较少见的汽车主机厂原厂改装房车的厂商，实力比大部分房车厂都雄厚。而它也有自己的房车租赁服务平台：“房车生活家租房车”小程序。

​
由于汽车主机厂自营的优势，可以利用其4S店网络进行服务，所以覆盖的城市比较多，而且所租的车型很齐全、车况好，甚至一些特色车型是外面平台租不到的。
这个小程序还可以方便地找到房车营地，基本覆盖了全国主要的房车营地和小车露营地，对于上汽大通合作的营地还可以方便地查看水电、停车收费情况和环境、玩乐项目，非常有心。

​
二：其他平台​
​如果你对自己的鉴别能力有信心，其实也可以尝试在万能的“闲鱼”寻找出租的房车，其实有很多规模很小的租车公司都会在闲鱼发布信息，价格会比在平台上便宜一点，覆盖的城市也更多。​
​但一定要鉴别对方是否有合法的租赁手续，必要时让提供出示营业执照等信息，而且一定要签好合同。
​

​
但​闲鱼的监管作用有限，不推荐没有经验的玩家尝试，在此仅作一个补充渠道供大家参考。
​三：车型怎么选​
​房车类型主要是C型和B型，C型的空间大，装载能力强，配置和储物空间更丰富，适合多人使用，但是驾驶起来不是很方便，比如在城区穿行、停车时都不太灵活，如果开省道、乡道，很多限高杆也会过不去；而B型房车的空间比较小，适合两个人使用，但开起来比较灵活，能通过更多的限高杆。C型车的租金一天在1200-1500元左右，B型车在700-1000元左右。
​如果你对房车的舒适性要求比较高，或者带着一家老小，也可以选择带拓展的房车，驻车时可以获得更大的生活空间，当然，租金方面也会更贵一些。​

​
​四：配置方面要注意什么
​不管你是为了购置房车前先体验，还是为了偶尔出游，租房车时一定要注意所选车型的配置，不然会大幅降低你的房车使用舒适性，进而对房车有所误解。
​最常见的问题就是租赁商没给你提供马桶降解剂、房车电器设施不足、缺乏充电设施。
​很多没接触过房车的人会误以为房车的马桶要自己倾倒未经处理的排泄物，其实房车马桶是要配合降解剂使用的，经过降解后，马桶里的东西就会变成无臭的绿水，不会很恶心（但会有降解剂本身特殊的味道）。
​一些租赁商的房车是低配车，生活电瓶容量很小，逆变器功率也不大，不仅用不了微波炉、电磁炉、空调等大功率设备，而且很快就会缺电，这会大幅降低使用体验，务必要询问清楚电瓶容量和逆变器功率。对于空调，尽量选择有220V车载空调或家用空调的房车，效果会更好。
​有大电池却缺乏充电手段也不行。很多车型只能用底盘车自带的小功率行车发电机、太阳能和外接电进行充电，这三种方式充电效率都非常低，无法满足使用。尽量选择有大功率行车发电和支持快充的房车，前者发动车辆后可以在两三小时内充满电，不心疼油费；后者可以利用现在越来越密布的充电桩充电，当然，不要影响到电动车主的充电哦。​
​其他生活配置大多房车都会配好，比如热水器、暖气、床单被褥等，如果需要用到锅碗瓢盆可以提前问问是否提供，不提供就得自己带上了。​
​其他方面和租赁普通家用车流程是一样的，都要准备好驾照、身份证、预授权的信用卡或支付宝等。</span>

阅读本文需要 3 分钟，安利我的新玩意儿——一台超迷你主机！ 
如果你喜欢本文，就分享给你的小伙伴！

01 需求
最近几年，对电子产品的欲望降低了很多。不过，两个月前，我萌生了弄一台办公小主机的需求。
其实，对于电脑，我一直没有太高的需求，不看 4K，更不玩游戏，最复杂最耗资源的需求，那就是视频剪辑了。
不过，我的视频剪辑需求，也算是非常入门了——只是使用 Camtasia 来完成课程视频的剪辑工作。
之前使用的电脑，都是笔记本：一台 Macbook Pro，一台华为。但因为办公升降桌很小，笔记本 + 带鱼屏往上一放，就更打挤了。
所以，迷你主机的需求，就这样诞生了。之所以需要迷你，是因为我不希望它太占空间，不然还不如继续用笔记本呢。
02 选品
最初，我本打算入手 Mac Mini，下单之前，顺手看了下 MacBuyer&#x27;s Guide（一个提供 Apple 家产品购买建议和指南的网站）：

好家伙，这一代 Mac Mini 已经发布 604 天，而平均更新周期为 634 天，所以，网站直接给打上了” 不要购买 “的标签：

我可不想前脚刚原价购买，后脚就上了新一代产品。所以，果断放弃。
然后，逛张大妈的时候，无意间发现这么个玩意儿：

这玩意儿叫DeskMini，看了一下详细介绍，机箱只有 1.9L，甚至比一瓶拉罐可乐大不了多少，嗯，尺寸似乎正合我意！
但这只是一个机箱 + 主板的准系统，我得自己另行购买 CPU、内存和硬盘。
挑选了一下，粗略计算了个总价，似乎能控制在 3500 以内，ok，下手！

于是，我就这样用上了人生中的第一台迷你组装机。
03 装机
准系统拿下，实际到手价格 909，包含机箱、电源、主板和风扇，另外还有一个无线网卡。
然后查了不少资料，确定下AMD R5600G这款 CPU，散片 1089 拿下！
硬盘不用太大，毕竟我有 NAS 服务器，所以，1TB 的铠侠 NVME 固态，527 拿下！
内存么，之前的电脑都是 16G，剪视频 + 开虚拟机的情况下，有些捉襟见肘，所以，怎么也得上 32G 吧…… 最后，654，拿下两条 16G 镁光 DDR4 3200。
然后，查了一下自带的无线网卡，最高速度 433 Mbps，岂不是让我的 NAS 毫无用武之地？怎么也处上 2.5G 无线网络吧？
好的，AX210 无线网卡安排上！拼多多 75 到手！
所有配件到齐，装机——

不得不说，第一次自己装机，我是真的手残，找了 N 个视频，折腾了两个小时，终于给装上了……

是真的很小，比我 500ml 的茶杯大不了多少，放桌面上毫无违和感。
04 体验
然后，重新整理桌面空间、开机、装上 Win11，常用的软件装上，测试视频编码。
旧的电脑，视频编码 CPU 占用直接狂飙到 100%，这小主机，占用率一起处于 60% 左右。
内存也一直没用到一半。

真香！
甚至，几年不玩游戏的我，还特意下载了 Steam，入手了地平线 5……
没错，集显玩地平线 5！

开低画质（第二档，下面还有极低），挺流畅的，不过没有测试帧率。
到这一步，我只能说：

AMD Yes!

05 再次折腾
用了一周之后，我发现一个严重的问题：

CPU 温度时常接近 70 度。

作为一名完美主义者，这能忍？
所以，我又萌生了换个散热器的想法。
因为主机太小，所以最高仅支持 46mm 的散热器。
所以，103，拿下这个规格的利民散热器！
安装安装安装……

不得不再次吐槽，我手是真的残，换个散热器，又搞了两个钟头……
而且因为底部螺丝拧得太紧，主板都给干弯了……
好了，温度果然下降了好几度，舒服了！
再后来，我又发现，这主机虽小，但扩展性还挺高：居然支持同时插上两块 NVME 硬盘、两块 2.5 寸 SATA 硬盘。
好的，继续拆！
把我闲置的 SATA 固态给装上当下载盘。
不得不说，手残归手残，折腾是真的爽啊！
06 结语
后面又买了一些小玩意儿，汇总一下这次折腾的总费用——

3400 不到的一台小主机，既能满足我办公的所有需求，又满足了自己折腾的欲望，何乐而不为呢？
因为机箱超小的关系，即便淘汰以后，还能做一台 HTPC 或者远程访问主机，多香呀~</span>

                              <span>Precision is at the core of Laura Fischer’s practice. Using cotton and linen threads in neutral tones, the Bellingham, Washington-based artist sheaths smooth stones in impeccably exacting grids. She forms the tiny squares and rectangles with a series of knots, mimicking the loom weaving process but working directly on the natural material. Paired together, the sculptures are finished with a twisting rope wrapped around the circumferences and suspended in staggered positions.
A few of Fischer’s pieces are available on her site. More</span>

                              <span>Los Angeles-based artist Sasha Vinogradova merges her fascination with nature and ornate design in a series of jewel-coated specimens. Sculptural in form to evoke a brooch or other piece of wearable art, the digitally illustrated insects encase gems and vibrant, iridescent body parts within a metallic structure. Symmetrical motifs adorn the wings and shells, adding an extra layer of ornamentation to the otherwise natural subject matter.
With a background in motion design and key art, Vinogradova works with various clients on illustrations and art direction. More</span>

The Free Software Foundation (FSF) started promoting the idea of sharing code way back in 1985, and since then it&#x27;s defended the rights of computer users and developers. The FSF says that the terms &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; are not effective words when classifying software, and instead considers programs either freedom-respecting (&quot;free&quot; or &quot;libre&quot;) or freedom-trampling (&quot;non-free&quot; or &quot;proprietary&quot;). Whatever terminology you use, the imperative is that computers must belong, part and parcel, to the users, and not to the corporations that owns the software the computers run. This is why the GNU Project, and the Linux kernel, Freedesktop.org, and so many ot…</span>

                              <span>如图所示，这满满的一背包现金，是我有生以来第一次摸过这么多钱，大概四十万左右，真的相当有份量。2017 年，我在微博发出这张照片的时候，大家都纷纷羡慕，以为是用来发奖金的，看来少数派是发财了，甚至连银行的营业员都变得十分热情，指望着我多买点理财产品。但实际上，这是我用个人信用担保，借出来的第一笔高额贷款，是用来保障少数派接下来两个月的工资和运营成本。
这可能就是「钱」的双面性，我们不能只用数量和数字来定夺结论，还要知道钱的来源和用法。很长一段时间，都有很多用户问我们：少数派靠什么赚钱，能赚到钱吗？这可能是理想主义之外，大家最关心的话题，我这里具体说说吧。
理想中的内容付费
我们想象中最理想的赚钱方式，当然是「内容付费」，我们从 2013 年就开始给作者发稿酬，从一年 20 万，到现在每年超过 100 万。作者提供有价值的内容，用户为内容付钱，逻辑很简单，但实操非常难。尽管已经十年了，有付费习惯的用户依然是小众群体，而作者分享的内容，也不一定对所以用户都有价值，匹配和触达目标用户的成本也越来越高。
所以我们先尝试推出了「付费栏目」，把聚焦一个领域的系列内容变成付费阅读，跟软件工具结合，涵盖设计、编程、信息等诸多方法论。我们今年也在迭代栏目，比如以年度为单位，从原来的纯内容付费，增加了在线沙龙、实操任务等更丰富的形式。我们的目的是希望通过这些栏目，帮助用户沉淀和成长。但这毕竟是一种逆反人性的学习模式，付费栏目尽管也做了五年，这部分收入也只能占 10%，并且有大部分收入要分给作者和开发者。
这期间，能赚钱的付费内容，大多是普世性的，比如缓解时代焦虑的成功学，刺激底层人性网络小说，但从长期价值角度，我们不想也不善于赚这个钱。所以从赚钱层面，我非常不成功，也冒出过放弃的念头。但总有用户会回来告诉我们，通过学习少数派某个栏目，对它的职场和人生带来了重要帮助，此时我们又更加笃定，要坚持做…</span>

                              <span>Artist Warren King (previously) finds much of his inspiration by wandering through Chinatown in New York City, where he encounters “street musicians, chess players in Columbus Park, vegetable sellers, knockoff handbag vendors on Canal Street, lion dancers during Chinese New Year celebrations,” he tells Colossal. “I’ve been fascinated during my weekly grocery shopping trips by the vibrant, diverse community there, which is so different from the relatively homogenous suburbs where I grew up.”
These passersby become the initial inspiration for the artist’s figurative cardboard sculptures, which consider his Chinese heritage, his parent’s immigration, and what it means to hold a diasporic identity. More</span>

Knowing how much of your disk is being used by your files is an important consideration, no matter how much storage you have. My laptop has a relatively small 250GB NVME drive. That&#x27;s okay most of the time, but I began to explore gaming on Linux a couple of years ago. Installing Steam and a few games can make storage management more critical.
The du command
The easiest way to examine what&#x27;s left for storage on your disk drive is the du command. This command line utility estimates file space usage. Like all Linux tools, du is very powerful, but knowing how to use it for your particular needs is helpful. I always consult the man page for any utility. This specific tool has several swit…</span>

A typical computer keyboard has only about 100 keys on it.
Most keys double up on characters, also called glyphs, thanks to the Shift key. Glyphs are frequently used to type letters with accents and umlauts, to produce characters used in mathematic or monetary expressions, or just to add fun emojis. In some regions there are even three glyphs available on select keys.
Regardless of your region, however, some glyphs don&#x27;t make it onto your keyboard. Fortunately, Linux provides access to these through a compose key.
There&#x27;s no compose key on your keyboard, at least not by default, but you can designate a key you&#x27;re not otherwise using as your compose key. I use the Alt key to t…</span>

其中，Android部分的 WebView容器代码可独立成一个代码库单独维护，并打包成aar给主工程引用。
我们出产这么一个SDK，目的是给与整个公司的研发部门出具一份前端H5与原生容器的统一交互方案，并使用统一的Web容器，避免各个业务方自行开发容器造成资源浪费。当然，做的就是全平台，包括iOS，Android，Flutter，本文只讲解 Android的设计概要，其他平台部分细节可以类推。
本文将会解析Android侧 容器代码进行详细拆解分析，讲述一个合格的容器库应该具备什么要素。由于由于每个团队每个人都有自己的代码风格和偏好的重点，所以不会涉及到太多具体的代码，只会对设计此SDK的必须要做的事或者强烈推荐做到的细节做出解释。
目标
SDK初始化流程
阅读一个SDK我们通常会从它的Demo入手，让demo运行起来看具体效果。而在代码中，第一个进入视线的就是Application这个类的配置了。一个SDK的初始化代码，在调用方看来应该尽可能简单，而且对性能影响最小化，否则会影响到app的启动速度。
WebView的引入和常用设置
在国内市面上主流的web容器，通常是以X5为内核，本节将讲述X5的常用配置，H5原生混合开发中通常会出现一些莫名其妙的兼容问题，这种问题有的可以通过WebView的 配置来规避掉。
webView与H5的交互流程设计

区别于iOS，android设备有不同的分辨率大小以及不同厂商的系统，目前市场的分辨率可以看下友盟的相关统计。

可以看到主流的分辨率有10多种，当不做适配时，一套代码在不同设备上的效果偏大、偏小、截断以及留白严重，那一套代码如何完美的展示在不同的设备上，可以看下面的一些适配方案。
二、UI适配
2.1、常见的适配方式
2.1.1、xml布局控件适配
避免写死View的宽高，尽量使用warp_content和match_parent；
父布局为LinearLayout，选择使用android:layout_weight属性，为布局中的每个子View设置权重；
父布局为RelativeLayout，可以选择使用layout_centerInParent等属性，设置子View的相对位置；
谷歌官方在之前版本中提供了一个百分比布局方式：support:percent，它支持RelativeLayout和FrameLayout的百分比布局，但是目前官方已经不再维护，而将他取而代之的是新晋布局：ConstraintLayout，ConstraintLayout强大之处不仅在于它能够进行百分比布局，还可以进行相对定位、角度定位、尺寸约束、宽高比、Chainl链布局等，在不同设备间都能处理的游刃有余。
2.1.2、图片适配
.9图
见2.1.4分辨率限定符；
2.1.3、依据产品设计适配
所谓产品设计适配，指的是产品流程在不同设备上有不同的展示方式，例如手机与Pad的区别，在手机设备上，一般来说具体Item列表是一个页面，点击每个Item会跳转至新的详情页；而在宽度&gt;高度的Pad上，为了防止页面空白浪费，一般会要求屏幕左侧为Item列表，右侧即详情页，item与详情页会同时出现在用户的视觉内，如下图

关于这种类型的设计，其实郭霖《第一行代码》给出了一个方案，我在这里抛砖…</span>

前言
背景

之前一直都是使用的Rxjava，响应式编程是真的写起来特别的简洁优雅，而且直观，一个数据流，从发射-&gt;中间的数据转换-&gt;消费一目了然（当然前提是本身使用恰当），其中各式各样的操作符完美覆盖任何场景。但是使用的多了也免不了会发现一些问题，比如debug的时候简直难受，还有对于当前逻辑没有显式的表明是否为子线程，特别在函数调用链长且在不同类的时候，往往要追溯很久等等此类。当然事物本来也无完美之事，我们能做的便是尽力追求完美的事物。
此外便是目前Android也诞生了很多新东西，所以我打算尝试一下，说不定能带来一些新的视角，因为一件新事物的诞生往往是需要解决旧事物的某处不足。
实现

目前WanAndroid公开的Api均已实现，我需要的是一个完美的App而不是充满着TODO项。
介绍
App内通篇全采用Material Design 3风格，拒绝半完成式Material带来的UI的割裂感。
我见多很多WanAndroid的开源客户端，在UI上都不怎么重视，但是如果要是日常使用的App，没有得体的UI我相信很难有使用的动力，而Material Design无疑是最好的选择
所有Icon取自Material Symbols，统一而规范的设计。
主题色遵循Material3 Color system。
PrimaryColor, On-primary, Primary container, On-primary container
SecondaryColor 同上
TertiaryColor
默认主题色采用Material Theme Builder从图片取色而成。
实现Dynamic Colors，开启动态主题色后，App主题色自动跟随系统主题色且适配深色模式，保持一贯的视觉体验(Android 12及以上支持)

前言
有了前面的基础，战机和敌机的环境已经搭建好了。故本文着重记录基于Flame实现飞机大战的战机子弹发射以及基于碰撞检测实现的子弹设计敌机和战机与敌机相遇场景。
笔者将这一系列文章收录到以下专栏，欢迎有兴趣的同学阅读：
基于Flutter&amp;Flame 的飞机大战开发笔记
子弹Component
创建一个继承自SpriteAnimationComponent的类Bullet1作为子弹的实现类。这个和之前的一样都当是一个序列帧处理。
class Bullet1 extends SpriteAnimationComponent with CollisionCallbacks {
  double speed &#x3D; 200;

  Bullet1() : super();

  @override
  Future onLoad() async {
    List sprites &#x3D; [];
    sprites.add(await Sprite.load(&#x27;bullet/bullet1.png&#x27;));
    final SpriteAnimation spriteAnimation &#x3D;
        SpriteAnimation.spriteList(sprites, stepTime: 0.15);
    animation &#x3D; spriteAnimation;
  }    

为了让子弹Component运动起来，沿用之前敌机Component的做法。在其update回调后更新position。
@override
void update(double dt) {
  super.update(dt);
  Vector2 ds &#x3D; Vector2(0, -1) * speed * dt;

                              <span>1、UI自动化测试简介
软件测试简介
​软件测试是伴随着软件开发一同诞生的，随着软件规模大型化，结构复杂化，软件测试也从最初的简单“调试”，发展到当今的自动化测试。
​自动化测试是什么呢？自动化测试是把以人为驱动的测试行为转化为机器执行的一种过程，自动化测试通常会借助某些工具或者框架。虽然不能完全取代手工测试，但相比手工测试来讲，自动化测试可以减少人力成本，降低重复工作，从而更快速、高效的进行测试活动。
​测试金字塔是一种自动化测试过程的金字塔形策略结构，用来指导软件开发过程中各层测试投入的工作量比例，其最早由Mike Cohn在2009年的著作《Scrum敏捷软件开发》中提出。Mike Cohn在书中指出：测试金字塔从上到下分为三层，分别是UI测试、服务/接口测试、单元测试，越接近金字塔底部的测试活动，投入的工作量应该越多，即单元测试投入工作量最多，接口测试次之，UI测试投入最少。

UI测试
​UI测试是最接近软件真实用户使用行为的测试类型。通常是模拟真实用户使用软件的行为，即模拟用户在软件界面上的各种操作，并验证这些操作对应的结果是否正确。
接口测试（API测试）
​API测试，主要针对的是各模块暴露的接口，通常采用灰盒测试方法。首先以黑盒方式设计如何调用API的测试用例，同时在测试执行过程中统计代码覆盖率，然后根据代码覆盖率情况来补充更多、更有针对性的测试用例。
单元测试
​单元测试，属于白盒测试的范畴，通常由开发工程师自己完成，越早发现缺陷其修复成本越低。
为什么要做 UI 自动化？
​随着不停的版本迭代，软件新增功能变的越来越多，对测试资源的需求也变得越来越大，执行人工测试的时间越来越长。对于人工测试的依赖开始变得棘手，因此大家开始寻找解决方案，UI 自动化也应运而生。
人工测试存在以下的弊端：
人工回归测试需要花费很长时间才能完成，很小的延迟就会让发布面临风险…</span>

而本人对官方架构示例 “ViewModel + LiveData 部分” 一向存疑，
故这期我们一起来关注 “领域层” 设计，拆解官方设计误区，并给出改善建议，相信阅读后你会豁然开朗。
官方示例一宗罪之 “违背原则之原则”
据 wiki 百科介绍，“最佳实践” 乃管理学概念，意即 “认为存在某种技术、方法、过程、活动或机制可使生产或管理实践的结果达到最优，并减少出错的可能性”，
故易知，架构模式即 “软件工程” 领域 “最佳实践”。
软件工程最佳实践有其原则，即 “设计模式 6 大原则”。然如说哪个原则是 6 原则之首、宁违背其他原则，亦不可违背此原则 —— 此即 “单一职责原则”。
单一职责原则与 “本质” 直接挂钩，架构模式设计如违背单一职责原则，是后续所有弊病祸根所在。如这么说无体会，那就继续往下，一睹为快~
官方示例二宗罪之 “ViewModel 职责混杂”
Jetpack ViewModel 本质有二，
一是页面状态容器，使页面旋屏重建后可直接从 ViewModel 拿取数据，免去传统 onSaveInstanceState、onRestoreInstanceState 之苦，
二是生命周期作用域可设定之容器，例如作用域设定为 Activity 级，则 Activity 旗下 Fragments 皆可共享 Activity 级 ViewModel 之公共数据。
由此易得，该框架违背单一职责原则。
但其实，这俩功能都有存在意义。那怎办，此时最佳实践即，通过创建子类，继续划分职责，直至各司其职即可，
例如可将 ViewModel 划分为 State-Holder 和 Event-Handler，
前者专职托管页面状态数据，是表现层组件，可作为静态内部类声明于 Activit…</span>

🏀什么是Navigation？官方文档的话有点不容易让人理解。所以，这里用我自己的话来总结一下，我们在处理Fragment是需要通过写Fragment的事务去操作Fragment的，而Navigation的出现是为了解决我们之前开发的一些痛点。Navigation主要用于实现Fragment代替Activity的页面导航功能，让Fragment能够轻松的实现跳转与传递参数，我们可以通过使用Navigation，让Fragment代替android项目中绝大多数的Activity。但需要注意的是在使用Navigation切换页面生命周期的变化情况，避免开发过程中踩坑。

使用Navigation具有什么优势？
处理Fragment事务
默认情况下，能正确处理往返操作
为动画和转换提供标准化资源
实现和处理深层链接
包括导航界面模式，例如抽屉式导航栏和底部导航，我们只需要完成少量的代码编写
Safe Args - 可在目标之间导航和传递数据时提供类型安全的Gradle插件
ViewModel支持 - 您可以将ViewModel的范围限定为导航图，以在图标的目标之间共享与界面相关的数据
如何使用Navigation呢？

前言
一年一年过的太快了，还记得两年前写了 Android 11(R) 的适配文章，这一转眼都13(T)了，这样算下去几年后26个字母就用完了，到时候也不知道 Google 会如何进行命名😂。
下面咱们来看看 Android 13 都有哪些更新，并来看看开发者应该如何进行适配吧！
隐私及权限相关
通知的运行时权限
在之前版本中我们应用如果需要弹通知的话只需要通过 NotificationManager 即可直接进行弹出，不需要任何权限，之前我一直觉得 Google 官方这一点做的不好，通知这么重要竟然不需要用户同意就可以直接弹出，当然你可以在设置中进行手动关闭，但这对于大多数人来说比较困难。然后在 Android 13（T-33）中终于引入了新的运行时权限——通知权限：POST_NOTIFICATIONS。
但是如果用户拒绝通知权限，他们仍会在前台服务 (FGS) 任务管理器中看到与这些前台服务相关的通知，但不会在抽屉式通知栏中看到这些通知。
这个更改对许多应用都有关系，只要你的应用会弹通知，那么如果要适配 Android 13 的话就都需要进行适配，当然适配方法很简单，再按照别的运行时权限适配下新的通知权限即可。
检查应用能否发送通知
如果想要确认用户是否已启用通知，可以调用 NotificationManager.areNotificationsEnabled() 来进行判断。
附近 Wi-Fi 设备的新运行时权限
在以前的 Android 版本中，需要 ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION 权限，应用才能完成与热点相关的多个常见 Wi-Fi 用例、Wi-Fi 直连、Wi-Fi RTT 等。
由于用户很难将位置信息权限与 Wi-Fi 功能相关联，因此 Android 13（T-33）在 NEARBY_DEVICES 权限组中引入了…</span>

背景：
在 debug 环境中主线程中方法体执行的时间与指定的时间做对比后的堆栈信息，针对性的优化超过指定时间的耗时方法体，减少 ANR 的发生
此工具类主要是通过向主线程Looper打印超过指定时间的耗时堆栈信息以及耗时时长，其中校验时间自已定义，主动查看主线程中的耗时操作，防患未然。
原理：
此工具类为最简单最直接处理、优化耗时操作的工具
大家都知道Android 对于ANR的判断标准:
最简单的一句话就是：ANR——应用无响应，Activity是5秒，BroadCastReceiver是10秒，Service是20秒
然后此工具类的方案就是将主线程的堆栈信息作时间对比监控，超时的打印出来
Looper.loop 解析：
应用之所以未退出，就是运行在loop 中，如果有阻塞loop 的操作就会发生ANR、崩溃
public static void loop() {
    final Looper me &#x3D; myLooper();
    //....
    for (;;) {
        if (!loopOnce(me, ident, thresholdOverride)) {
            return;
        }
    }
}

主要看死循环
loopOnce
private static boolean loopOnce(final Looper me,
        final long ident, final int thresholdOverride) {
    Message msg &#x3D; me.mQueue.next(); // might block
    if (msg &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
        // No message indicates that the message queue is quitting.
        return false;
    }

    // This must be in a local variable, in case a UI event sets the logger
    // *当有任务的时候打印Dispatching to *
    final Printer logging &#x3D; me.mLogging;
    if (logging !&#x3D; null) {
        logging.println(&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dispatching to &quot; + msg.target + &quot; &quot;
                + msg.callback + &quot;: &quot; + msg.what);
    }
    //.... 中间部分未任务执行的代码
    
    //执行结束之后打印 Finished to 
    if (logging !&#x3D; null) {
        logging.println(&quot;
上述注释之间的耗时就是主线程在执行某个任务时的耗时，我们只要拿这个时间和指定时间相比就能监控主线程的耗时堆栈信息了
使用方式：
Application:
 //主线程中方法体执行的时间与指定的时间做对比后的堆栈信息，针对性的优化超过指定时间的耗时方法体，
MainThreadDoctor.init(500)

查看日志：

日志等级为明显起见使用error级别

前言
继续前面的内容，本文主要记录基于Flame实现飞机大战的敌机创建及生成器的基本内容。
笔者将这一系列文章收录到以下专栏，欢迎有兴趣的同学阅读：
基于Flutter&amp;Flame 的飞机大战开发笔记
敌机构建
创建类Enemy1继承SpriteAnimationComponent，和之前的Player类一样，只是这个是代表敌机的Component。
class Enemy1 extends SpriteAnimationComponent {
  Enemy1({required Vector2 initPosition, required Vector2 size})
      : super(position: initPosition, size: size);

  @override
  Future onLoad() async {
    List sprites &#x3D; [];
    sprites.add(await Sprite.load(&#x27;enemy/enemy1.png&#x27;));
    final spriteAnimation &#x3D; SpriteAnimation.spriteList(sprites, stepTime: 0.15, loop: false);
    animation &#x3D; spriteAnimation;

    add(RectangleHitbox()..debugMode &#x3D; true);
  }

ps：这里继续使用SpriteAnimationComponent，只不过只有一帧。
最后我们在Game层的onLoad添加一个敌机Component，先假定敌机的位置在(50,50)，大小为50 * 50。当然这里还有前文的Player。

背景&amp;笔者碎碎谈
最近Compose也慢慢火起来了，作为google力推的ui框架，我们也要用起来才能进步呀！在最新一期的评测中LazyRow等LazyXXX列表组件已经慢慢逼近RecyclerView的性能了！但是还是有很多同学顾虑呀！没关系，我们就算用原有的view开发体系，也可以快速迁移到compose，这个利器就是ComposeView了，那么我们在RecyclerView的基础上，集成Compose用起来！这样我们有RecyclerView的性能又有Compose的好处不是嘛！相信很多人都有跟我一样的想法，但是这两者结合起来可是有隐藏的性能开销！（本次使用compose版本为1.1.1）
在原有view体系接入Compose
在纯compose项目中，我们都会用setContent代替原有view体系的setContentView，比如
setContent {
    ComposeTestTheme {
        // A surface container using the &#x27;background&#x27; color from the theme
        Surface(modifier &#x3D; Modifier.fillMaxSize(), color &#x3D; MaterialTheme.colors.background) {
            Greeting(&quot;Android&quot;)
            Hello()
        }
    }
}

那么setContent到底做了什么事情呢？我们看下源码
public fun ComponentActivity.setContent(
    parent: CompositionContext? &#x3D; null,
    content: @Composa…</span>

                              <span>先看墨迹天气效果图

因为需求原因，改了一些样式

话不多说，直接开始，首先是画出这条曲线，找到每个小时温度对应点位，连成一条线，左边显示最高温度和最低温度，最高温度对应曲线中的最高点，最低温度对应曲线中的最低点，直接上代码
private Point calculateTempPoint(int left, int right, int temp) {
    double minHeight &#x3D; tempBaseTop;
    double maxHeight &#x3D; tempBaseBottom;
    double tempY &#x3D; maxHeight - (temp - minTemp) * 1.0 / (maxTemp - minTemp) * (maxHeight - minHeight);
    Point point &#x3D; new Point((left + right) / 2, (int) tempY);
    return point;
}

传入点的左边距，右边距和这个时间段对应的温度，返回一个Point类，Point类中有x，y两个属性，构造方法如下
public Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x &#x3D; x;
    this.y &#x3D; y;
}

tempBaseTop和tempBaseBottom是在初始化中按高度比例来分
tempBaseTop &#x3D; (mHeight - bottomTextHeight) / 3;
tempBaseBottom &#x3D; (mHeight - bottomTextHeight) * 3 / 4;

bottomTextHeight是下方数字文本高度

                              <span>今天去参加了飞书在深圳的城市大会，现场聆听谢欣讲了飞书的整体逻辑，组织管理的关键点是文化、制度、工具，前两者都很难改变，只有工具才是最佳切入点。回想起少数派折腾工具，建立团队协作的过程，有一些值得分享的幕后故事。

作为一群研究并推荐工具的年轻人，自然也要真正用上这些「先进」工具，所以我们很早就开始启用 Slack 和 Quip 这些海外工具应用。应该说，海外工具的开放性和创新性，确实给团队协作带来了很多有趣的玩法，穿梭于个各个工具之间，用机器人建立各种自动化流程，避免了很多重复劳动，我们也很快开始为这些工具付费了。
后来，团队成员慢慢变多，每个新人都要注册一堆海外工具账号，学习成本不断增加，数据风险也开始不可控。我们也不断尝试国内的协作工具，定位和文化的各种原因，确实没法满足团队的需求。

同一时间段，上万人规模的字节跳动，也在经历这个过程，各种折腾之后，他们决定开发自己的团队协作工具——飞书。
少数派接触飞书其实非常早期。我们一直用媒体资源扶持中小开发者，其中有一个日程工具产品被字节收购，创始人并入了飞书项目组。他作为少数派的资深读者，一直推荐我们关注飞书产品，并且敢打保票，包你满意。

我当时就质问他：你们大公司做项目，经常是壮士断腕，万一市场反馈不好，说停就停了，我们整个团队也跟着白折腾了。
他说：你放心，字节几万人都靠这套工具运作，每年节省下来的人效成本，都足够养活整个工程部门了，放心大胆用吧。

于是，我们就成了飞书最早期的小客户，虽然那时的产品还有很多小 Bug，但确实保持了其他平台欠缺的开放性和创新性，团队成员直接从海外工具平移过渡，用的顺手，很快就升级付费了。
我们自己用好之后，还推荐给内容同行们试试，包括小特社区、影视飓风、先看评测等团队都开始尝试和采买飞书，整体反馈也相当不错。
紧接着，2020 年疫情爆发，大家纷纷开启了远程办公模式，飞书为了帮扶更多中小企业转型线上，下放了整个 Office 的协作功能，开启了阶段性的免费模式，这也带来了很多效率工具的个人用户。

借着这个机会，我们也开始琢磨飞书产品的外部生产力价值。于是，我们将几百人的作者社群，从微信搬到了飞书，用即时通讯模块讨论选题，用飞书文档来约稿创作，用飞书表格来进行内容排期，最后我们还开发了「少数派助手」企业应用，帮助作者把飞书文档上的成稿，一键同步到少数派，并直接发布。飞书不仅解决了内部协作需求，也变成了少数派整个内容创作流程的生产力工具。

转眼两年过去了，飞书从 Office 工具切入，不仅提供了完善的在线文档、多维表格等功能。现在已经开始提供基于人员管理的 People 服务；基于产品研发的飞书项目；基于行政财务的财税综合服务。企业协作体系更加健全了，也开始制定了新的收费策略，价格虽然已经是当年的好几倍，但我们还是选择了付费。
另一个特别有趣的现象是，我们发现身边有大量的生产制造企业也开始使用飞书，包括安克、飞傲、渴创等等，少数派很多品牌客户、联名合作商，都把微信沟通群迁移到飞书上，用文档讨论项目，用表格处理货品，用飞书开会，大家的效率都得到了提升。
如今，飞书已经开始服务理想汽车、元气森林、华润等各个领域的中大型企业了，我们却还是一个几十人的小公司，没能跟上时代的大潮，倍感惭愧。但我们在飞书上有数百人的作者群，还有数千人的会员群，他们都是来自各行各业的精英，都在跟少数派一起体验着飞书的产品魅力，这也算是给未来的「先进企业」埋下火种了。
当然，工具再好，效率再高，也不要了忘了我们追求效率的最终目的，不是攀比谁更狠，谁更卷，而是要把节省出来的时间，更多的放在兴趣爱好和品质生活上，人生不能只活在科技和效率之中，还有广袤的田野和动人的音乐呢。</span>

                              <span>每个人都有自己的一个工作流，或者说自己的工作习惯。我也有自己的一套工作流程，不过这个工作流一定只会是一个历史产物，我们永远要与时俱进。《随机漫步的傻瓜》这本书里面提到索罗斯，专门说到他这类股市大鳄完全不受过去的行为束缚，摆脱了路径依赖，每一天对他来说都是一张白纸。工作流这事可以借鉴，当你低效工作的时候，可能却感觉一切恰到好处，那你很可能有了路径依赖。
我的工作流，其实完全是围绕分心这件事做的努力。静气，定力，专注，这些听上去像是一个人的个人品质或者能力，真的是一件不可训练的事情吗？我们在信息裹挟的年代，一定要在信息的洪流中随波逐流吗？未必。
知己知彼，百战不殆。我先根据我相对狭隘的研发工作场景来聊聊造成分心的来源。
首先肯定是和信息相关，社交信息，新闻资讯，生活琐事。这些碎片化的内容，随时在挑战我们的专注力。凭自己的意志力，真的就很难去和大数据和人工智能搏斗。
其次就是研发工作本身，虽然交流和沟通不算特别频繁密集，但是工作过程中涉及到的材料是多方面的。包括Gitlab，Tapd，CoDesign等等。我们经常在切换窗口和切换桌面中迷失，或者突然会发现忘记自己要找的是什么文件。这种因为频繁切换上下文导致的分心，不是像你关闭手机通知这样简单粗暴就能处理，更是棘手的一大问题。
最后是一个过载问题。比较简单，一个是需求加塞，一个是多项目穿插，一个是非常短的时间需要交付。我总结的比较简单，但是让一个人大脑过载的场景真的会让人在焦虑中分心和低效。就像电脑内存不够用一样，换电脑是一个选择，对程序的性能优化可能是一个更高技术活的高性价比（当然可能未必高）之选。人脑做不到，你要求它随便扩容，那处理过载问题导致的分心，肯定是绕不过的一个问题。
工作流核心
既然已经抽丝剥茧了，那我接下了说说我的解决方案，终于谈到工作流的内核了。
信息批量处理
应对碎片信息和通知，我的方法很简单，应该大家都用过。…</span>

痛点
总有小伙伴留言或私信问我：

王老师，我没有基础，想要入门数据科学的话，上某某辅导班（收费 XXXX 元），靠谱不？

这问题，还真是不好回答。因为那样的辅导班，我没上过，着实不知道质量如何，不敢妄下判断。
想跨专业系统学习数据科学知识，除了辅导班会让你挑花眼以外，书籍、资料和网上的学习资源也不好挑选。因为数据科学知识技能的特色是发展迅速。一年多以前别人使用某个方法、模型做出的结果，还能发在高水平期刊上。今天你使用同样的方法，却可能会被无情拒稿。这不完全是你的错，只是在这么短的时间里更好的模型已经出现了。你学到的内容嘛，很不幸，落伍了。
那你的下一个问题应该是：

有没有足够省钱，还能随时更新保持追上前沿的学习资料？

这听着很贪心。真有人告诉这样的好事儿，你也会怀疑他是不是个骗子。但实话实说，这样的免费学习资料还真的有，而且一直被很多初学者忽视掉了。因为它并不存在于某个知名的 MOOC 平台上，而是寄身于一个数据科学竞赛网站的角落里。
人们的刻板印象会认为，只有知识技能掌握足够好才会去参加竞赛，因此并不期待竞赛网站会负责详细介绍基础入门知识。这可能让很多人与它失之交臂。
这个竞赛网站，叫做 Kaggle 。这套课程，叫做 Kaggle Courses 。
发现
我最初发现 Kaggle 的这一套自制课程，是在 2018 年 4 月份。之所以还能知道具体的时间，是因为我当时做了笔记。

你看，随手及时记录笔记，很重要吧？
当时 Kaggle 自制课程的名称，还叫做 &quot;Kaggle Learn&quot; 。初始课程的门数很少，只有 6 门。

但是早在 2018 年，我就觉得 Kaggle 这个课程很有特色，所以才专门记录了笔记。什么特色呢？至少包括以下两点：

As I was sitting in a meeting room, speaking with one of my teammates, our manager walked in with the rest of the dev team. The door slammed shut and our manager revealed that he had a big announcement. What unfolded before our eyes was the next project we were going to develop—an open source CLI (command line interface) application.
In this article, I&#x27;d like to share what I learned during our development process, and specifically what I wish I had known before we began developing Datree&#x27;s CLI. Perhaps the next person can use these tips to create a great CLI application faster.

                              <span>一直以来都有一个做自己产品的梦想，在移动互联网初期的阶段，印象中还是在2012年，我在第二家任职公司主导做过一款产品上线，可惜当时年轻气盛没放在心上，我就去苦心钻研设计了。
这10年里我一直在设计行业深耕，期间也与朋友做过一些产品，也有一些小的成果，由于种种原因最后产品被迫下架了，所以做产品这件事儿，其实陪伴了我的整个从业阶段。
一直以来我认为音乐除了本身的声音以外，还应该传递更多的情绪。【Dtd Playlist】的出现，其实是我在疫情期间居家时，萌生出的一个念头，我想着是不是可以做一款放在桌面上“看着”的歌单产品？有了这个念头后，我就停不下来了，开始着手设计产品、原型、做UI以及相关的准备。
现在你看到的这篇文章是我在验收完合伙人的代码、提了无数bug后，觉得需要记录一下整个过程。毕竟这是我的第一款产品，我要好好对它。
产品名字是【Dtd Playlist】，看名字大家应该能猜得到是一款歌单App。
💥  主打功能：
🔳  精选10种常用场景音乐（学习场景、运动场景、摸鱼放空、深夜emo…），并且实时更新，源源不断
🔳  超酷的GIF播放背景，还有有趣的数字时钟
🔳  真空式播放，没有那些乱七八糟的，只有音乐
🔳  不同风格的版式设计，放在桌面享受与众不同

因为我自己是个资深的Apple Music和Spotify的用户，也是多年的歌单忠实爱好者，所以在筹备阶段，做的第一件事情就是思考我需要放哪些音乐进去？以及如何放？
于是我找了非常多的资料，最后选定以【情绪、场景】来做整体的歌单分类，音乐接入Apple Music和Spotify，由于时间原因，第一个版本只支持Apple Music。
歌单分类页面
 
/late night🌛
最终我精选了10个基于场景的播放列表，并制定了整体的获取机制，让产品随时更新和随机播放。
另外在设计产品的过程中，我一直把设计图放在手机支架上，但我总会去偷看时间，所以在歌单的基础上，我希望用户侧目就可以看到正在播放的音乐以及现在的时间。
所以最终的产品大概就是你们看到的这样：
一个有点不一样、传递情绪的场景GIF + 一个有点意思的数字时钟。
播放页面场景类别不同的播放版式
想想还有哪几个隐蔽的点没有说...

双击喜欢：双击喜欢歌曲后，会同步到Apple Music的喜欢列表，后续你可以在Apple Music听到更多同类型的音乐
切换分类：第一版本还是希望产品更加简单一些，所以分类做的比较隐蔽，点击左上角可以展开

后续看看用户反馈再做一些更新迭代，我自己也有一些迭代计划，大概是以下几点：

接入Spotify
歌单持续迭代的逻辑
“喜欢的歌曲”列表
持续更新更多版式
音乐小组件

【Dtd Playlist 】目前已正式上线，欢迎你在 App Store 下载体验。
最后，希望【Dtd Playlist】能让你放在桌面享受与众不同的音乐，也欢迎大家评论区随时给我们提出意见及建议。
接下来我也会着手进行第二款产品的设计以及开发工作，后续会持续在这里与大家同步。

去年的这个时候，我正提交了英国摄影专业的艺术学校申请，在家热火朝天地准备语言考试。得益于去年整体的新冠疫情较为平稳，我最终得以顺利出国，前往位于伦敦的皇家艺术学院（Royal College of Art）就读为期两年的摄影硕士（Photography MA）项目。
关于摄影硕士有什么好读的这个问题，我想这个问题背后的逻辑大概是这样的：在某种程度上，艺术家或者摄影师其实本身并不是特别需要学历去完成职业发展的几个种类——著名的画家们似乎并不是每一个人都有大学学历。
与之相比，更需要学历的职业好像是律师、医生、公务员等。
然而，在今天的现代社会，想成为靠某一项艺术手段谋生的人，我们能想到的最好的方法似乎是去读一所艺术大学。
来了英国以后，我找到了有几个理由似乎可以解释为什么在今天发达的互联网环境下——我们可以在互联网上学习到一切我们想要学习的技术——我们依然需要学校。
学校教什么？
首先我们不得不承认的是，在互联网上看到的大多作品，是基于算法的赋权机制出现在你面前的。所谓「算法」的基本规则就是：你的软件认为你可能对这样的内容感兴趣。而算法的规则很可能是由一些和我们想要获得的信息不相关的原因，诸如：之前有看过的相似内容；其他与你「相似」的用户喜欢这个内容；这个内容花了钱让它推广等等。
换句话说，我们在互联网上获得有效信息的过程时常是差强人意的。在这个过程中，冗余、重复、无聊的信息往往会在信息流中占据大多数，我们可能要花费比预期多很多的时间才能获得那些真正对我们来说有用的信息。而大学则扮演了一个帮助我们高效率获取有用且前沿的信息机…</span>

为了给有想法下山的朋友避坑，本文和大家总结分享一下矿卡相关基础知识及简单翻新操作，觉得有用欢迎关注、点赞、收藏三连哈。

 
⏹ 本文目录
本人不卖矿卡，由于矿卡的特殊性也不会给大家推荐店铺，别问我在哪儿买，谢谢理解。

 
⏹ 购买前丨必须了解这些再下手
先回答下大家比较关心的问题，请看完这段再决定买不买。
1️⃣ 矿卡到底能不能上？
如果手头比较紧，上矿卡肯定是性价比比较高的选择，毕竟刚开始批量出货的到手品质肯定比较好，等大货出的差不多了残次品占比也会高点，参考当年的星际蜗牛。

 
当然，买矿卡就是买闷包，到手到底咋样谁说了都不算（包括个人矿），点亮肯定能点亮，不过满载之后的稳定性就不好说了，撞温度墙降频基本跑不掉，比如我自己收的3060 12G就这毛病。

 
一般来说拆机清灰换个硅脂能解决上面说的温度问题，但是也有可能是烧过显存或者GPU核心的返修卡，所以说建议脸黑的朋友就不要考虑上车矿卡。

 
2️⃣ 需要准备多少预算？
矿卡出货目前主要有四个梯队，价格差距不看卡的状态，只看是不是一二线品牌：

300~400元价位的A卡RX580 8g
800~900元价位的N卡GTX1660s 6G和GTX1080 10G
1600-2000元价位的N卡GTX3060 12G/GTX3060ti 8G和A卡6700XT 12G
2000~2200元的N卡GTX3070 8G

 
另外还有最近和都市怪谈一样的BYD代工EVGA 3070/3070Ti，某鱼到处都是求收购，没见过有谁真拿到手，BYD官网也出来辟谣了，感觉JS炒货可能大一些。

 
3️⃣ 去哪儿买比较靠谱？
只能某鱼或者某转了，确实也有低于常规价格10-15%的低价卡，一般是走大货10张起拿，个人用户不…</span>

引言
Fragment 诞生之初就被定义为一个小型 Activity，因此它代理了 Activity 的许多能力（例如 startActivityForResult 等），职责不够单一。随着 Jetpack 各种新组件的出现，Fragment 的很多职责被有效地进行了分担，其本身也可以更更好地聚焦在对 UI 的划分而管理上面，以前的一些 API 也可以退出历史舞台了。本文就盘点一下 Fragment 那些被废弃的 API。
本文的介绍基于 Fragment 版本 1.4.0
1. instantiate

以前， Fragment 的构造函数不允许携带参数，因为某些场景中 Fragment 会由系统自动创建，例如基于 XML 创建 Fragment、Activity 被杀死后的恢复重建等等。此时，系统通过调用 instantiate 来创建 Fragment，instantiate 通过反射调用 Fragment 无参的构造函数。
现在 Fragment 的构造函数允许携带参数了，我们可以通过自定义 FragmentFactory，调用 Fragment 的任意构造函数，而系统通过调用 FragmentFactory 来创建 Fragment。
我们可以自定义 FragmentFactory，并重写它的 instantiate 方法来创建 Fragment：
class MyFragmentFactory(private val arg: Any) : FragmentFactory() {

    override fun instantiate(classLoader: ClassLoader, className: String): Fragment {

应用场景：
智慧出行。
智能汽车是集环境感知、规划决策、多等级辅助驾驶等功能于一体的智能网联综合系统，它集中运用了计算机、现代传感、信息融合、通讯、人工智能及自动控制等技术，是典型的高新技术综合体。简单的说，智能汽车的出现将逐步放松车、手、眼，让开车，用车变得简单。这样的产品对有本儿不敢上路的人来说或许是大大的福音。
在北方冬天有点冷，这个时候，去车里，温度很低，给人一种不舒服的感觉，那么有没有一种可能，就是可以通过手机App，实现对车内的一些情况的监测，答案是有的，今天做的这个App，就是这样一个App。
我要实现的功能主要有
用户可以解锁任何车门，
检查电池状态，
控制空调温度，
检查轮胎的气压。
在开始之前大家可以先预览一下我完成之后的效果。如下图所示：

是不是很炫酷呢？

前言
最近在学习基于Flutter的游戏引擎Flame，并尝试自己编写一个飞机大战。本文将记录工程搭建和玩家战机创建的过程。强烈推荐在阅读文章前，优先食用以下内容，这将会对你有一定的Flame知识基础。当然，Flutter的基础也是必要的。
Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏专栏 - 张风捷特烈的专栏
flame-engine/flame: A Flutter based game engine
环境及资源搭建
新建项目后，在pubspec.yaml中添加Flame的核心依赖。ps：这里笔者使用的是当前最新的1.2.0版本。
environment:
  sdk: &quot;&gt;&#x3D;2.17.5 
还有就是常规的Flutter静态资源配置了。ps：这些资源不全是在本文中使用，图片资源都是在网上找到的，是微信飞机大战的资源仅为学习所用。

创建战机
游戏环境
void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(game: Game()));
}

class Game extends FlameGame with HasDraggables {
  @override
  Future onLoad() async {}
}

在Flutter的main函数中，runApp传入一个GameWidget，实际是一个StatefulWidget。Game继承自FlameGame，它是Flame定义的一个Component。Flame依赖于Component进行展开，类比于Flutter依赖于Widget。后续在游戏里的对象都会是在FlameGame对象中添加Component实现。

                              <span>View的绘制过程主要都包含在ViewRootImpl#performTraversal方法内，这个方法内主要包括了measure、layout、draw这三个步骤，具体就不放在这里讲述了。我们主要关注下，每次绘制时Framework内是怎么发起到调用的。
1. requestLayout请求绘制
app侧不论是调用requestLayout或是调用invalidate方法来触发重绘，最终都会调用schedueTraversal方法，开始绘制流程，只不过是在该流程中决定是否执行measure、layout或者draw。
ViewRootImpl.java
public void requestLayout() {
    if (!mHandlingLayoutInLayoutRequest) {
        checkThread();
        mLayoutRequested &#x3D; true;
        scheduleTraversals();
    }
}


void invalidate() {
    mDirty.set(0, 0, mWidth, mHeight);
    if (!mWillDrawSoon) {
        scheduleTraversals();
    }
}

我们重点看下scheduleTraversals方法做了哪些工作
void scheduleTraversals() {
    //mTraversalScheduled字段保证同时间内的多次修改只会执行一次渲染过程（如更新text时）
    if (!mTraversalScheduled) {
        mTraversalScheduled &#x3D; true;

                              <span>找不到合适的配图，一直以来是我对写作心存畏惧的原因之一。正所谓「一图胜千言」，很多时候写好了的文字，总差一张恰到好处的配图画龙点睛。
另一方面，中文环境下比文字版权状况更糟糕的，可能就是图片版权了。不少新媒体 / 自媒体不能恰当地引用图片并标注来源，其实累积了不小的法律风险1。
所幸少数派的大部分作者专注于软硬件分享，可以或截图、或自拍、或借用官方商业图片（毕竟通常是正面宣传，没有太大的风险），从而规避了上述问题2。
所以今天分享的内容，可能只适用于少数派了吧 : )
什么是 DALL · E？
2021年1月，致力于「用通用人工智能造福全人类」的 OpenAI 公司基于其 GPT-3 模型发布了划时代的 DALL·E，实现了从文本生成图像。
来自 DALL·E 论文的 Figure 3，第一行图片是正对照，第二行图片是由 DALL·E 基于每列标题自动生成的图片，剩余三行奇奇怪怪的图片由其他对比算法生成。
DALL·E 的弱鸡版（mini）去年 4 月公开，完全版（mega）一直拖到今年 5 月，DALL·E 2 都正式发布了3，才趁大家都在排队时偷偷放出。
所以我们在指南中建议如下策略，并在后文提供每个策略的具体步骤：

只是想测试看看效果，可以直接使用 Hugging Face 上的 dalle-mini；
需要程序化频繁调用，可以考虑在 Google Colab 部署一份私有的 mini；
追求更好的生成效果，有条件的同学可以尝试一下 mega。

直接使用 mini 版

访问 dalle-mini 模型在 Hugging Face 上的页面；
在文本输入框填入语句，点击 Run 运行；
等待 20-60s 就能看到结果了，就这么简单！
为了方便对比效果，我们统一使用官方案例「an armchair in the shape of an avocado（牛油果形状…</span>

                              <span>我高中的时候迷上了看小说。那时候躲在被子里，拿着一个寸照大小的单色屏幕的 MP3 看小说，小小的屏幕上只能装得下几十个字。被子里我的我，看得时而咬牙切齿，时而捂嘴狂笑，时而热泪盈眶。多达200多万字的修仙小说，我能一连看十几天。
在这小小的屏幕上，除了文字啥也没有，但是文字符号的力量就是那么神奇，它能通过视网膜成像在我们的大脑里，我们的大脑能把这些符号转化成信息，然后组成连续的意义和因果关系，从而刺激我们的各种感官，激发各种情绪。
为什么符号具备那么强的魔力？它背后的原理是什么？理解它对我们阅读学习有什么帮助？
如果你能耐心看完，应该能获得不少新启发。
符号的神奇之处
从出生开始，我们一直在与各种符号共存。但是我惊异于它能够将毫无相关的事物与我们的意识产生连接，这样的能力是除开人类以外的其它动物无法做到的。

只有人类能够理解符号与它代表的事物之间并不存在必然联系。人类能够故意用一样东西来代表另外一样东西的过程，就叫象征化过程（symbolic process）。——《语言学的邀请》

如果你被老虎疯狂追赶，这个时候，你向它扔出一坨香喷喷的鲜肉，它也许会停下来。但是如果你向它扔出一箱100万元，那就一点用都没有了。但是对于人而言，一坨肉和一箱100万元的价值可想而知。
百度百科说符号即具有代表意义的标识，但是符号本身没有意义。

当你仔细定睛去观测一个符号，你会发现，它只是屏幕上的一粒粒像素组成的复杂黑色线条，它是纸页上印出的规则的墨水痕迹，它也可能是由人类声带震动而发出的一连串声响，是我们思绪里映射有限事物的横、撇、竖、点、捺（“一”、“丿”、“｜”、“灬”、“㇏”）。当我写完上面这段话后，我突然陷入到了一种发呆的状态，这密密麻麻的文字，如果我不看它，它也什么都不是。
《符号学：原理与推演》里说，意义有一个同样清晰简单的定义：意义就是一个符号可以被另外的符号解释的潜力，解…</span>

“无线缰绳”(wireless leash)[1]是什么？“无线缰绳”是一种看似无形实则束缚的状态。第一次看到这个词语，是在邱林川的《信息时代的世界工厂》。他在书中描绘道：21世纪初，珠三角地区工厂的工人们通过手机形成了工作和情感交流的信息网，工厂老板意识到了手机赋权的影响后，开始禁止工人在工作时间使用手机，但这样的效果并不明显。于是，工厂开始主动购买分发手机，并建立了工厂内部集群网。
“手机便于携带，老板命令员工无论何时何地都必须带手机，就可以让员工一直处于掌控之中”，同时，老板还可以针对语音和短信进行内部监控，进而令工人们产生心理恐惧。最终，“以前只能在车间里，在生产线上控制工人，现在则可以有一个针对劳工的无线监控网络体系，每周7天每天24小时不间断地达到控制目的。”[2]
如今，经历了3G、4G到5G的通信网络迭代，以及智能手机不断地推陈出新，“手机”已经不再被在工作中禁止，甚至成为了一种工作的工具，不管是老板还是员工也都已经习惯了“手机不离手”的状态。但那根看不见的“无线缰绳”，始终缠绕在我们的身体乃至精神之上，有时被我们短暂性地遗忘了，有时却明显地牵引和控制着我们。本文聚焦“无线缰绳”探讨它如何影响着我们的工作和生活。
“无线缰绳”提升管理效率
在监控技术出现以前，“无线缰绳“是离线的、断网的、原始的，它倾向于外在的道德或法律规范，或者内在的自我良知。
《礼记·为政》有云：道之以德，齐之以礼，讲究用道德来引导人民，用礼仪来规范人民。从非技术角度讲，这种管理方式同样属于“无线缰绳”，它为社会树立了一套规范，既包括道德的，也包括法律的。而在个人层面，“君子慎其独也”(《礼记·中庸》)也可以看作是一种内在的约束。宗教意义上，“无线缰绳”是无时无刻不再注视着你的神的眼睛。而监控技术背后，也是这样一位凝视者。它仿佛牧羊人，照看着所有的…</span>

前言
Flutter 的画笔类 Paint 提供了很多图形绘制的配置属性，来供我们绘制更丰富多彩的图形。前面几篇我们介绍了 shader 属性来绘制全屏渐变的聊天气泡背景、渐变流动的边框和毛玻璃效果的背景图片，具体可以参考下面几篇文章。

利用光影变化构建立体旋转效果
Flutter 实现背景图片毛玻璃效果
本篇我们引入一个 Paint 类新的属性：maskFilter，再结合之前的 shader 和动画，看看能玩出什么花样。
MaskFilter 类简介
MaskFilter 类，顾名思义是遮罩过滤器，也就是在绘制过程中给图像加一层遮罩效果，这个遮罩效果是通过某种变换函数实现的。Flutter 官方文档的说明如下，可以看出其实就是对位图的颜色处理。
A mask filter to apply to shapes as they are painted. A mask filter is a function that takes a bitmap of color pixels, and returns another bitmap of color pixels.
遮罩过滤器应用于要绘制的形状，其实就是一个函数，接收一个彩色像素位图，然后返回另一个彩色像素位图。
在 Flutter 里面，目前只提供了一个 MaskFilter 的命名构造函数方式实例化，就是模糊效果。这个模糊效果和我们的图片模糊有点类似，也是使用高斯模糊，只是多了一个模糊样式参数。定义如下：
const MaskFilter.blur(
  this._style,
  this._sigma,
)…</span>

诚然有些标题党了，因为在拍照的时候通常只有两个状态：下意识的按下快门和琢磨如何调整拍摄角度以达到最好的拍摄效果。遇到需要正经拍摄或者抓拍时再思考，那大概率是来不及了。
但如何达成随手一拍就是自己想要的照片构图和视角，这确实是需要不断思考的。最近梳理了一些照片和拍摄随笔，自娱自乐的同时也想抛砖引玉，和大家一起聊聊关于摄影这件事的个人理念和拍摄思路。

2016 年机缘巧合开始使用被笑称为 1％ 的 Nokia Lumia ，第一次体验到了蔡司（手机）镜头的锐度和 Lumia 相机的高可玩度。从此走上了 手机 -&gt; 黑卡 -&gt; 微单 -&gt; 单反 -&gt; 手机 的摄影爱好不归路。当我真正意识到我喜欢摄影这件事时，恰恰是我以 Lumia 928 和 iPhone 5s 这两部手机为主，完成了我人生的第一个 365 作品：即连续 365 天每天拍摄一张照片发到朋友圈。由此学习到了基础的拍摄概念，并慢慢找到了自己的拍摄风格。
后期软件上也历经学习电脑端的 PS，LR 和手机端的 Camera 360，泼辣，Vscam。现在使用频率最高，也是最为顺手的则是谷歌出品的修图软件 Snapseed。
拍照一时爽，修图到天亮
在过去的数年间，智能手机摄像头的快速发展，让我这样的普通人可以以较低的门槛来享受捕捉美图的快乐，而无需购买昂贵的单反设备，因此带来了摄影领域的一片欣欣向荣。一键修图等美颜或滤镜类的软件则带来了全民出图的高潮和审美的疲劳。
那我是如何看待拍照这件事的呢？且听我慢慢道来。

前言
本篇文章是《Android开发艺术探索》第6章的读后感和实践Demo，是关于Android的Drawable的相关知识。
在之前写Bitmap的文章时，有个很有意思的问题，就是在Android中，Bitmap、Drawable和自定义View有什么区别？好像在平时开发中，我们遇到简单的UI需求，比如圆角的按钮背景，我们第一反应就是使用Drawable；然后稍微复杂点的UI需求，我们就自定义View来实现；但是简单的UI需求，我们也可以使用自定义View来实现，而且BitmapDrawable还可以加载Bitmap，那这个Drawable存在的意义是什么呢
Bitmap就是用来保存图片的位图数据，是保存图片；而View是通过测量、布局和绘制的步骤来实现效果；而Drawable则是一种可以在Canvas上进行绘制的抽象概念，可以这么说，它有了View的一半的功能；既然只有View的一半功能，它存在有必要吗？
当然有必要，Drawable可以简化实现一些图像效果，最大的好处就是方便。Drawable一般被用作View的背景来使用，而实现就是在XML文件中进行定义即可，如果这些效果用自定义View的话，会麻烦很多。
Drawable的内置种类在源码中有很多，这些Drawable可以通过图片、颜色构造各式各样的图像效果，熟练掌握这些Drawable，可以避免在开发中重复造轮子。
正文
我们先介绍一个Drawable比较重要的参数，然后再挨个介绍和使用内置实现的各种Drawable。
内部宽高
一般来说Drawable是没有大小概念的，因为Drawable可以通过图片或者颜色构成，当使用颜色构成时，把Drawable作为View的背景，其大小会被拉伸到View的同等大小。
但是其有内部宽/高的这个参数，可以通过getIntrinsicWi…</span>
