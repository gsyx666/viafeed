It is a very common need in almost all applications to modify the components provided by 3rd party libraries. Those modifications are generally done for:
Changing the styles
Adding a missing feature
And it is very crucial for such libraries to provide ways to achieve those modifications easily.
In the first part of this tutorial we will learn how to modify styles so that our changes do not conflict with future updates of Angular Material library. As a bonus, I will provide a list of thumb rules which you should follow while making any style changes.
In the second part of this tutorial, we will learn all the ways to customize angular material buttons and decide which is better.

Using vulnerable and outdated components with known vulnerabilities has always been in the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks. You can take a giant leap in securing your projects only if you use up-to-date tools and libraries.
If you have the Not invented here (NIH) syndrome, you prefer to develop everything from scratch. That&#x27;s fine if you have the time and money to do so. But building major things like cryptography and web servers from scratch needs a lot of skills and effort. Such complex components cannot be built by a single person. Even if you have made one, you should not use it in production without in-depth reviews from many other people.

Sealed Secrets can works perfectly well with Argo CD. It is one of the very best secret managment approachs that you should consider.
The same idea can apply to both Helm, Kustomize or other GitOps tools.
There is no golden standard about secret management in Argo CD. Instead, Argo CD just provides you a list of solutions here and you have to think it yourself. 
Although I opt-in for Sealed Secrets, I also want to show you why you should use it instead of just telling you to use it.
To answer why, we need to think about two questions.
Although there are many solutions available, basically there are just two ways to store secrets, i.e. store in secret management platforms or git repositories. 
I don&#x27;t prefer to use secret management platforms.
No matter what platform you use, it won…</span>

All the code used in this tutorial can be found on my GitHub project: docker-github-runner-windows.
Welcome to Part 1 of my series: Self Hosted Docker GitHub Runners on Azure.
In part one of this series, we will focus and look at how we can create a windows container image using docker that will essentially be a packaged up image we can use to deploy and run self hosted GitHub runners as containers. We will focus more on the docker image itself and how we can build our image and run our image on a local server or VM running docker for windows and also scaling out multiple instances of our image using docker-compose.
Part two will focus on building a Linux based Ubuntu image and in parts three and four, we will look at how we can utilize Azure to store and run our containers in t…</span>

When working on a project with multiple developers, git and Github is one of the mostly used tools for code collaboration. 
Imagine a situation where you are working on a feature and before you are done, you 5 different commits. But then, your organizational rules says each pull request must have 1 commit. This means you have to find a way to merge all the 5 commits into 1 (squash them) and then push to your branch before making a PR. Making a PR with 1 commit could also help avoid multiple issues when pulling with rebase. 
The question now is, how do you bring all 5 commits into 1.

                              <span>There are several benefits of using Semantic HTML:
It brings about structure and clarity in the code.


Well-constructed and clearly interpretable markup helps with Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Search Engines are able to parse and find headings, paragraph texts and key words from a document much more easily if semantic HTML is used. So, semantic HTML increases SEO scores of a HTML document.


Semantically strutured HTML document favors accessiblity of a website using screenreaders. The site can be navigated better with semantic HTML by visually impaired people.


Semantic HTML is developer friendly, as it helps with both writing and reading the code.


It helps avoid writing unnecessary markup that may increase the size of an HTML document.

                              <span>xplr takes pride in being an awesome file explorer, but it also lets us perform file management operations by utilizing the existing command-line tools that are designed to do one thing, and do it best. For example,
Type : c f to create files or : c d to create directories. By default, xplr uses touch and, mkdir commands under the hood, but you can configure it to use anything else. Note that you can create multiple files and directories once you are into the &quot;create file/directory&quot; mode. Once done with creating, Press escape to leave that mode. Also, you can provide paths like ./non/existing/path, ../../existing/path and xplr will create them for you.

While development, there is a need to get fields from local storage (ex., userId, token, etc). This chrome extension helps create entries that read data from storage and show it in a small window at the bottom left corner of the development window.
Features:
Create an entry by entering a local storage key name, path (if the key’s value is an object) &amp; a label for reference.
Clicking value copies the content to the clipboard.

                              <span>The for..loop is also a type of iteration or iterating sequence, which repeats a certain block of code at certain times until a certain condition is reached.


For number in range(9)


The for loop unlike the while loop can be used to iterate over lists 


Here&#x27;s an example of the same code I wrote with while loop last week wrote with for loop


The for loop can only be used to iterate over a fixed number of times provided I&#x27;m the range()
The while loop cannot be used to iterate over a list 
I generally use the while loop for an  unknown number of times which can be input by the user when the code run over for the  loop

                              <span>In this tutorial, you will learn in a few short steps how to create a scroll to top button with CSS inset shorthand and vanilla JavaScript.
Scroll to top button can be very helpful for websites with lots of content, pages with infinite scrolling, or mobile devices with a small screen that can cause the content scroll to extend.
You can follow along with this tutorial by forking this template.
To create a scroll button, use an anchor tag with href&#x3D;&quot;#&quot; this makes the browser return to the top of the page when clicked, or you can use a custom Id to return to a specific part of the page.

To make the button position fixed relative to the viewport, you need to set position: fixed on the anchor tag. When the element position is fixed, it gets removed from the normal …</span>

每年都有给自己定个写一个小工具或者软件的小目标，刚好最近有背英语的需求，苹果商店里的背单词软件感觉都好复杂，而且字体好小，咱只要一个简单的单词本，顺便可以利用碎片时间背背英语单词就好了，所以就自己弄了个小工具，随便学 swift 练练手。
工具主要目的是工作的时候把单词放在角落，定时切换，偶尔瞄几眼记一下，起到潜移默化的作用！自己用了 1 个星期左右，感觉还行，就抽空优化了些用户体验功能，加了收藏，手动切换单词，自定义切换时间等，分享出来给有需求的同学用～

第一次写 mac 的软件，有啥不好的点见谅！有问题可以反馈给咱，抽空应该可以再优化下！后续想再加一下音标和读音的功能，不知道有没有好的 API 可以调用。</span>

我的需求说一下：
主路由。
50 个设备左右。
千兆的。
稳定的、性能够用的路由器养老就行。所以像友善这种基本没有官方稳定固件需要折腾各种野路子固件的软路由我就觉得很难受。
其实手里有一个红米 AX6 基本可以满足我的需求，CPU 也蛮不错的，奈何固件实在太离谱了，作主路由连 NAT loopback 都不支持（现在似乎很难找到不支持 NAT loopback 的路由器了），离大谱。
想请教 V 友们，有没有推荐的主路由？华硕 AC86U 做主路由怎么样？</span>

前几天偶然发现这个みんなの自動翻訳＠ TexTra®，是日本国立研究開発法人情報通信研究機構（ NICT ）开发的机器翻译工具。
https://mt-auto-minhon-mlt.ucri.jgn-x.jp/
这东西很强大，提供其他免费机器翻译的基本功能外，还提供一个在线的编辑器（在 [ Google 翻译者套件] 下架后，这个可能是为数不多的免费版在线翻译者工具），以及各种 api 。
但是，这是一个政府的项目，用户数据会被收集用于项目改进。不可商用。
它还有一些有趣的功能，比如“日语缩短”，把复杂的日语一键缩短为简单的日语。</span>

前段时间刷过翟东升老师的视频，讲到疫情期间降低压力，发达国家发钱，我们国家其实也有实力这样做，但是选择了发消费券，刚好昨天抢到了京东 的数字人民币消费券，吐槽一下
数字人民币软件
一个银行搞一个钱包，每个银行还支持的不一样，
​比如目前发现只有招行支持京东的数字人民币支付，如果我要确定那个类型数字钱包支持某一个软件（比如天府通、京东），我得把这几个银行钱包都创建一遍才能确定，及其麻烦
数字人民币消费券
我昨天抢到满 5000-600 的券，我真还不知道怎么使用，比如京东这个，首先的是京东自营的商品。即便是我选择了京东自营的实物，付款选数字人民币支付的时候完全看不到减多少钱的券出来 信息描述，付款上仍然是原价格，就离谱
我这里尝试选择了一款 iphone 13 为例试试，结果发现 买 13 原价 5999-600 京东券&#x3D;5399 。  再减 600 成都消费券 4799 不是和 6 月 1 号活动价一样的吗？？？
啊这。。。。

第一次使用 Firestore, 数据都是前端直接对 db 进行读写. 用 firestore 之前, 进入新页面调用相关 API, 后台接收到请求进行验证+数据处理. 而使用 firestore 后, 前端需要直接操作 db 字段, 需要后端做的只有监听, 比如有多个字段关联, 监听到某字段更改后, 需要后端对相关字段进行处理.
所以有一部分逻辑(REST API 后端的逻辑)在这种模式下需要前端来做, 前端的代码架构需要调整, 比如 REST API 的架构, componentDidMount 进行页面数据请求, button 点击进行网络请求. 而 firestore 架构下, 进行网络请求需要换成 db 读写操作. 这会让代码发生变化.
所以在想, 前端有必要写一套类似后端 REST API 的接口吗? 当页面 didMount 或者按钮点击时候, 直接调用前端自己的封装方法. 这些方法里面对 firestore 进行读写, 并且有相应的成功回掉以及错误类型等.
其次, firestore 这种模式叫什么(对标 REST API)? 
其他大厂或者国内有无 Firebase Firestore 这种东西? 
和 gql 对比呢? 
firestore 比较适合什么项目?
优缺点有哪些?
欢迎大家提供建议.</span>

以下是对于平台的看法：
微博现在变成伸冤平台了，时不时看得血压上冒；最重要的是关注了一群画师、美女、厉害的博主，博主也会转发一些种族、社会阶级、性别对立、负能量等
知乎的热搜基本上和微博同步，都是社会民生问题；
B 站虽然有资讯，但是基本上以 up 主个人输出为主，我更希望看的是群体内容输出
同理微信公众号
小红书上虽然有美丽的图片，但是文字评论都是清一色的赞美
qq 空间上面感觉充满了个人生活动态，以及个人情绪方面，转发类内容都是挂人或者认同居多
同理微信朋友圈
今日头条感觉是老年人使用的 app
我的抖音首页基本上是洗菜拖地的，感觉画风严重不符
所以有没有一种平台或者平台过滤器可以过滤不良消息，又可以看到自己想看的消息呢？</span>

Windows 10+之后, 系统添加了就近共享功能, 但这个功能需要蓝牙, 在局域网内, 它传输走到是 WIFI 协议, 速度很快, 但一旦没有蓝牙, 此功能就直接不能开启. 很多同事的电脑是旧的台式机, 没有蓝牙, 就用不了此功能, 让他们买个蓝牙装上有不大情愿(一群老古董), 这就导致传文件变得一点都不方便.</span>

1 、在本地使用 trzsz -d ssh x.x.x.x 登录服务器。加 -d 是开启拖文件上传功能，默认是不开启的。
2 、将 trz 和 tsz 放到服务器某个 PATH 目录下，要有可执行权限。执行命令 trz -v 不会报错即可。
项目地址：https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-go ，给个 Star 支持下？
在 Release 中下载的 zip 里就是三个 trzsz、trz、tsz 可执行程序，也可以自己 clone 下来 make 编译。
在 Mac 上的效果如图（也支持 Windows 和 Linux 的）：

踩坑指南（特别是 Windows ）：
1 、trzsz ssh 时记得加上 -d 或 --dragfile，如 trzsz -d ssh x.x.x.x。
2 、记得将 trz 放到远程服务器某个 PATH 目录下，要有可执行权限。
3 、在 Windows 的 cmd 、PowerShell 、Terminal 上，标题不要有“管理员”，即不要“以管理员身份运行”它们，要不然可能拖不了文件。在我的电脑上 Terminal 总是以管理员运行，后来设置一下 UAC 重启电脑就好了。
4 、在 Windows 的 cmd 、PowerShell 中，拖多个文件进去，也只有一个文件生效的（ 鼠标指向那个 ）。
5 、在 Windows 的 Terminal 中，要拖文件到左上角，出现“粘贴文件路径”时再放开鼠标，要不然没用。</span>

better365.cn ，就是 iShot 的开发商，它有什么过往的黑历史或是让人不能接受的地方吗？
最近了解到这家的软件，也看到它们的软件上架了 MAS 。
看到这家是大陆的软件公司，而且印象中在 V2 看过声讨它们家的帖子，有的伙计声称绝对要回避它们家的软件。
一般来说，上架 MAS 的软件我不会有什么顾虑。但是考虑到开发商是大陆备案（指网站）过的企业，而且貌似有很多负面评价，因此特地在这里发个贴问一下。如果有知道它们家黑历史的，请不妨赐教。
当然，如果只是免费突然改收费，或者是订阅制收费高这种我都能接受。毕竟已经准备花钱了。
我不能接受的是马克丁那种背后搞小动作，或者是软件偷偷安装后门，扫描收集个人信息的，那种一票否决。</span>

                              <span>你好，技术兄弟，最近红帽发布了最新的操作系统 RHEL 9，RHEL 9 满足了混合云的所有要求。它可以安装在物理服务器、虚拟机和容器镜像中。

当我们没有订阅的时候，想安装软件包来做实验，那么设置本地的 Yum 或 DNF 仓库将是很方便的。

在本指南中，我们将介绍如何在 RHEL 9 上使用 DVD 或 ISO 文件一步一步地创建本地 Yum/DNF 资源库。

创建本地 Yum/DNF 资源库的先决条件:


最小化安装 RHEL 9 系统

具有管理权限的 sudo 用户

RHEL 9 DVD 或 ISO 文件


1）挂载 RHEL 9 ISO 文件或 DVD

我们假设 RHEL 9 iso 文件已经被复制到系统中。运行下面的挂载命令，将 ISO 文件挂载到 /opt/repo 文件夹。

$ sudo mkdir /var/repo
$ sudo mount -o loop rhel-baseos-9.0-x86_64-dvd.iso /var/repo/




如果是 DVD 光盘，运行：

$ sudo mount /dev/sr0 /var/repo/


2）在 /etc/yum.repos.d/ 目录中创建仓库文件

在 /etc/yum.repos.d/ 目录下创建一个名为 “rhel9-local.repo&#x60; 的仓库文件，内容如下：

$ sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel9-local.repo
[Local-BaseOS]
name&#x3D;Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 - BaseOS
metadata_expire&#x3D;-1
gpgcheck&#x3D;1
enabled&#x3D;1
baseurl&#x3D;file:///var/repo//BaseOS/
gpgkey&#x3D;file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

[Local-AppStream]
name&#x3D;Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 - AppStream
metadata_expire&#x3D;-1
gpgcheck&#x3D;1
enabled&#x3D;1
baseurl&#x3D;file:///var/repo//AppStream/
gpgkey&#x3D;file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release


保存并关闭该文件。



3）刷新 Yum/DNF 和订阅管理器的缓存

执行以下命令来清理 Yum 或 DNF 和订阅管理器的缓存。

$ sudo dnf clean all
$ sudo subscription-manager clean




在上面的输出中，我们得到一个警告信息 This system is not registered with an entitlement（系统没有注册权限）。所以，为了抑制这个警告信息，编辑文件 /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf，将参数 enabled&#x3D;1 改为 enabled&#x3D;0。

$ sudo vi /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf




保存并退出该文件。

4）使用本地仓库安装软件包

现在我们都准备好测试我们的本地仓库了。运行下面的命令来查看配置仓库。

$ sudo dnf repolist


输出：



现在，试试用 dnf 命令通过上面配置的本地仓库安装软件包。

$ sudo dnf install nfs-utils


输出：





完美，上述输出证实了 nfs-utils 包及其依赖项已经通过本地配置的 Yum 或 DNF 仓库成功安装。

这就是本指南的全部内容。我希望你觉得它有参考价值。请在下面的评论区发表你的疑问和反馈。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-14696-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                              <span>比起无处不在的 Google，有些搜索引擎替代品更加尊重隐私，而 DuckDuckGo 就是其中之一。

最近，这个搜索引擎有了很大的改进，搜索一般网页十分顺畅。在搜索本地地点方面，则还远不及 Google。

不过，DuckDuckGo（简称为 DDG）有一些很酷的功能，大部分用户还没注意到。如果你是一位 DDG 狂热粉，你可能会喜欢用这些小技巧来提升你的搜索体验。

1、跳转到特定网页

在你最喜欢的网站名称前输入 ! 即可直接进入这个网站。则类似于 Google 的 “运气不错” 功能，但用 DDG 的话来说，这就叫 “叹号搜索”。

有一些网站有缩写形式，开始输入时便会提示。



在网站名后面输入搜索词，就可以直接抵达那个网站的搜索结果处。

2、文本转 ASCII

Figlet 是一个 有趣的 Linux 命令，可以将任意文本转换为漂亮的 ASCII 画格式。

在任意搜索词前输入 figlet，就会显示 ASCII 输出。无需打开终端。



3、检查社交媒体的状态

在某个人的 Twitter 名前加上 @，就会显示 TA 的状态（关注者等）。



4、生成强密码

输入 password 并加上需要的字符数，就可以生成一个独特的强密码。



5、生成随机密码短语

输入 random passphrase 可生成一段密码短语，通常长度为 4 个词。



6、获取一份速查表

在需要看速查表的搜索词后面，可输入 cheatsheet。如果要搜索的东西有速查表，就会立即显示在搜索页面。



7、通过色码获取颜色

输入 color 并加上你想查的颜色的十六进制码，便可显示这个颜色。



8、生成随机数

搜索 random number 会输出一个 0 到 1 之间的随机数。

                              <span>为奋起直追 SUSE Linux Enterprise 的 SP 4 ，openSUSE Leap 15.4 到来了，带来了新的升级和极其重要的改善。




即将到来的 openSUSE 小发布版本终于来了。如果你使用 openSUSE 作为你日常使用的桌面或服务器版本，你现在可能已经测试候选版本好几周了。

openSUSE Leap 15.4 的重点是软件包的更新，用以奋起直追 SUSE Linux Enterprise 的 SP 4 。因此，你将注意到一些弃用的软件包，以及可用于替换它们的新的升级。

当然，你应该有一些可用的软件包来确保兼容性。但是，大多数较旧的版本已经被移除。

openSUSE Leap 15.4: 有什么新的变化？

为与最新的 SUSE Linux Enterprise（SLE）相适应，像 Python 2 和 KDE 4 一样的软件包已经被移除。你可以在这次的发布版本中找到较新的桌面环境。

此外，在容器和 AI/ML 用例方面，更新了 Podman、Containerd、Tensorflow 和 Grafana。

Leap Micro 5.2

Leap Micro 是针对容器和虚拟化工作负载定制的轻量级操作系统的最新版本。它也是 Leap 版的 MicroOS，是 Tumbleweed 的一种变体，提供了自动管理和修补。

桌面环境

Xfce 4.16 继续保留，但你可以找到主要功能的一些新补充，包括新图标和调色板。

Xfce 4.16 中的设置管理器也获得了视觉上的刷新。类似地，文件管理器（Thunar）也有一些改善，新的状态托盘插件的深色模式支持等等。

KDE 4 软件包已经被弃用，Plasma 5.24 LTS 已经作为长期支持版本中包含于其中。

要深入了解这些变化，你可以查看我们之前针对 KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS 的报道。总体来说，新的 KDE Plasma 体验应该会令桌面用户赞叹。

说到 GNOME，你可以发现包含在 openSUSE Leap 15.4 中的 GNOME 41 带来了一系列的改善和新的特色功能。了解更多关于 GNOME 41 的信息，你可以期待它的一些新的特色功能。

对于其它的可用的桌面环境来说，Leap 15.4 包括：


MATE 桌面环境 1.26

Enlightenment 桌面环境0.25.3

深度桌面环境 20.3


弃用的软件包

移除了一些基础的软件包，包括 Python 2（生命终结）、Digikam、TensorFlow 1.x 和 Qt 4 等软件包。

在更新系统后，你可以使用 Qt 5 和 Plasma 5 。

更新的软件包

很多重要的软件包在 Leap 15.4 中得到了更新，包含一些流行的软件包：


TensorFlow 2.6.2

Podman 3.4.4

GNU Health 4.0

sudo 1.9.9

systemd 249.10

AppArmor 3.04

DNF 4.10.0

LibreOffice 7.2.5


因此，你应该会注意到一些针对服务器用户和桌面用户的各种应用程序的有用更新。很多多媒体应用程序，像 VLC、GNOME MPV 等，都得到了升级。

其它改善

随着基本软件的更新和清理，你也可以找到一个由 SUSE 维护的较新的 Linux 内核 5.14.21。

更新后的内核对硬件的支持应该会有改善。

更多信息，你可以参考针对 openSUSE Leap 15.4 的发布版本说明。

Apple announced on Friday that it’s once again updated its rules about how Dutch dating apps can use third-party payment systems, after the company had “productive conversations with the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM).” The updated rules give developers more flexibility about which payment systems they use, change the language users see when they go to pay, and remove other restrictions that the previous rules put in place.
While the rules aren’t wide-reaching (again, they only apply to Dutch dating apps), they do show what Apple’s willing to do to comply with government regulation — which it could be facing a lot more of as the EU and US gear up to fight tech monopolies, and potentially even force the company to d...

With CES 2022 having wrapped earlier this year, the future looks bright for those who are looking to nab a great TV at a substantial discount. Many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models during the event, ranging from The Frame and LG’s new C2 lineup to Sony’s forthcoming QD-OLED models. And now that manufacturers like Samsung and LG have announced official pricing details and are starting to launch their new TVs, we’re noticing prices beginning to fall on the last-gen, 2021 models.
However, if you’re looking to pick up a solid deal before the new models arrive, fret not, as there are already some great discounts available. There are currently a number of discounted 4K TVs...

I wouldn’t be surprised if you have no idea who Duke Nukem even is — that’s how hard the classic video game franchise cratered a decade ago. Today, the character is mostly known as a punchline for video game vaporware jokes, about how Duke Nukem Forever spent 14 years in development hell only to become a huge flop. 
And yet for years now, Duke’s corporate owners have been whispering that a movie is coming, culminating in The Hollywood Reporter’s story today: Legendary Entertainment has tapped Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg to actually produce a feature film.
I don’t quite know how to react! As a gamer who actually quite liked Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem II and Duke Nukem 3D, I absolutely agree that this...

Capcom has launched a demo of Resident Evil Village that’s powered by Google’s Stadia cloud gaming tech, letting people test out the horror game in a browser. In a press release, Google says that the idea is to let people try out the game, no matter what device they own. The game and its demo were already available for Stadia subscribers, but now anyone can try it out for free, provided they have a supported web browser and an internet connection faster than 10 megabits a second. You don’t even need a Google account; you just navigate to the website, enter your birthday (the game’s rated M), and click the play button.
As for how the demo looks... you certainly get what you pay for with the browser version. Here are a few comparison shots...

One perk most wireless carriers offer to pull you to their side is a free streaming video-on-demand subscription, but now AT&amp;T won’t be giving HBO Max to new customers, and hasn’t replaced it with a different service either. The carrier stealthily discontinued its top-tier Unlimited Elite plan for new subscribers this week, and added a new one that doesn’t include HBO Max anymore, as reported by Next TV (via FierceWireless).
The new top plan is called Unlimited Premium, which comes in at the same $85 a month for a single line. Just like with the now-grandfathered Elite plan, Premium subscribers get unlimited talk / text / data, 4K video streaming, and no slowdowns even if they use a lot of data (a promise AT&amp;T introduced for its priciest...

                              <span>铯是元素周期表中最活泼的金属之一，其金属性甚至超过了钫。然而由于分布的分散，价格的高昂，以及极其活泼的属性，铯的应用和实验一直很少有系统性展示，本期节目不仅包含了铯稳定同位素铯-133的全属性展示，还包含了铯最致命的放射性同位素铯-137的介绍，这也可能是全网第一次对铯-137可见量的展示。

                              <span>MongoDB 6.0 带来了加密查询

即将发布的 MongoDB 6.0 中，可查询加密功能提供了查询加密数据的能力，而且整个查询事务都是加密的。这种端到端的客户端加密使用新颖的加密索引数据结构，被搜索的数据在数据库服务器上一直保持加密，包括在内存和 CPU 中。密钥永远不会离开应用程序，该公司认为查询速度和整体应用程序性能都不会受到新功能的影响。拥有大量敏感数据的组织，如银行、医疗机构和政府，会对这一功能感兴趣。

老王点评：加密查询确实是一种非常有用的新功能，尤其是还能够不影响性能。我知道 IBM 也在做相关的研究，但是似乎没有出现在数据库产品中。




Chrome 102 将通过本地机器学习来阻止页面通知提醒

谷歌在博文中承认，“一方面，页面通知有助于提供你关心的网站的更新；另一方面，通知权限提示可能成为一种骚扰。”当谷歌的新 ML 模型认为你不太可能接受某个通知权限提示时，它将抑制这些提示。此外，这些都发生在你的本地机器上，所以你的浏览数据都不会进入谷歌的服务器。

老王点评：难道这些页面通知不是 Chrome 们释放出来的潘多拉吗？




AWS 称将云化大型机工作负载

“大型机现代化计划”是在去年年底 AWS 在会议上公布的，试图帮助企业将其基于大型机的工作负载迁移到云中，并有可能将其转变为现代云原生服务。该计划可以使客户保持现有的应用程序，并以最小的代码改动将其重新平移到 AWS。但有分析师认为，将大型机工作负载迁移到云端的公司，几乎肯定要在未来的某个时候对其进行重构或重新编码，从而背上技术债务。

                              <span>选择一款最中意的文字处理程序把你的想法打印到纸上。




作家们总是在寻找更好的方法将他们的文字和想法以更好的方式呈现给他们的读者。我对文字处理程序最早的印象是在 Apple II 上使用 AppleWorks 和后来的 FrEDWriter，后者是一个创建于 1985 年的免费文字处理程序。这是我的学生们的标配，他们许多人来自没有钱购买专有软件的家庭。

Abiword

在 20 世纪 90 年代时，我开始使用 Linux，寻找我可以使用的高质量的写作程序，并推荐给跟随我进入开源软件世界的学生们。我首先接触的文字处理程序是 AbiWord。AbiWord 来自西班牙语 Abierto，意思是“开放”。它最早发布于 1998 年，并且之后一直在升级。它使用 GPLv2 开源协议。它支持列表、缩进，字符格式等基本功能，支持 .doc、.html、.docx、.odt 等多种格式文件的导入和导出。



Etherpad

Etherpad 是一个开源协作编辑项目。它可以让你像 Google Drive 那样实时编辑文档，主要的区别是它是完全开源的。据它的网站上介绍，你可以“与你的朋友、同学或同事一起写文章、新闻稿、待办事项，同时在同一个文件上工作”。其源代码可随时查看。Etherpad 采用 Apache 2.0 开源协议。你可以直接在线使用它，或者把它下载并 安装 到你的 Linux 电脑上。

Cryptpad

CryptPad 是一个端到端加密的写作套件。使用 GPLv3 开源协议，并且源代码公开在 GitHub 上。它由 Xwiki 实验室开发。可替代 Google Drive，并且是自主托管的。根据其网站描述，“CryptPad 旨在实现协作办公。实时同步文档的更改。由于所有数据都已加密，因此该服务及其管理员无法查看正在编辑和存储的内容。” Cryptpad 为用户提供了 丰富的文档。

Focuswriter

FocusWriter 是一个简单的免干扰的编辑器。它使用隐藏式界面，鼠标移动到屏幕边界时才显示界面。它使用 GPLv3 开源协议，并为 Linux 提供了 Flatpak 软件包，也为 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 提供了 DEB 和 RPM。下图是一个 FocusWriter 桌面的例子。这是一个非常简单直观的界面，菜单自动隐藏，当鼠标指向屏幕顶部或边缘时才会显示。文件默认保存为 .odt 格式，也支持纯文本、.docx 和富文本。



LibreOffice Writer

LibreOffice Writer 是我最喜欢的，我已经使用了十多年了。它拥有我需要的所有特性，包括富文本格式化。它还拥有我见过的最多的导入、导出方式。类似于 APA 这样的问卷和出版模板它拥有十多种。我最喜欢的是它可以将文件导出为 PDF 和 epub。 LibreOffice Writer 是一个自由软件，使用 Mozilla 公开许可证（MPL）2.0 开源协议。其 源代码 由文档基金会提供。LibreOffice 支持大多数 Linux 发行版。同时它也提供 Flatpak、Snap 和 AppImage 软件包。另外，你也可以把它下载并安装到 MacOS 和 Windows 上。



OpenOffice Writer

Apache OpenOffice Writer 是一个全功能的文字处理程序。它可以简单地用于备忘录，也可以复杂到足以编写你的第一本书。依据官网的描述，OpenOffice Writer 将文档自动保存为 .odt。它还支持将文档保存为 .doc、.docx、富文本和其他格式。OpenOffice Writer 使用 Apache 许可证 2.0 开源协议。源代码在 GitHub 上公开。

还有许多自由开源软件等着大家去发现。它们非常适合完成你的日常任务，你也可以为它们的发展做出贡献。你最喜欢的 Linux 文字处理器程序是什么呢？

                              <span>Linus Torvalds 发布了用来测试的 Linux 内核 5.19 RC1，带来了一些重大变化。


继上个月 Linux 内核 5.18 发布之后，Linus Torvalds 宣布了 Linux 内核 5.19 系列第一个候选版本。与此同时，Linux 内核 5.19 官方合并窗口关闭，这意味着除非是关键性的，否则不会再接受任何新功能。

简单看一下 Linux 内核 5.19 的新内容，会发现 CPU、GPU、网络、存储和核心模块都有常规的更新。此外，代码清理、淘汰过时硬件和对以后芯片组的持续支持是此版本的亮点。

在进一步介绍之前，让我们简单来看一下这些新特性。

Linux 内核 5.19（RC1）的新特性

CPU

首先需要提及的是，Linux 内核 5.19 开始 初步支持 龙芯架构的 CPU 系列。龙芯由中国龙芯中科公司设计开发。龙芯架构的 CPU 是兼容 MIPS 架构的通用微处理器。不过虽然现在提供了支持，但是你仍不能在龙芯 CPU 上启动 Linux，因为一些代码还在审核中。希望在 5.20 版本中能够使用。

新的 英特尔 IFS 驱动 在该版本中落地，这有助于在部署前后发现硬件问题。它能够在早期阶段检测电路层面的 CPU 错误。

在前几个针对英特尔 CPU 的内核版本中一直在对电源管理和散热方面进行开发，这个版本 也不例外。首先，为 Raptor 和 Alder Lake 家族添加了英特尔 运行时平均功率限制Run-Time Average Power Limiting（RAPL）的支持。其次，改进了 P-state 驱动以处理频率变化，并且基于 CPU 的缩放支持被添加到被动 devfreq 中。

虽然英特尔 CPU 主要是散热和电源管理方面的工作，但对 AMD CPU 系列来说有更多的性能更新。首先，计划在今年年底完成 ZMD Zen 4 CPU 的 基于指令的采样Instruction-Based Sampling（IBS）模块引入了更多更新。此外，此版本引入了 PerfMonV2，提供了更多性能监视能力。

此外，该版本中移除了 a.out 支持。同样，过时的 Renesas H8/300 CPU 也被移除了。

主要 ARM 更新

终于，主线 Linux 内核能够 支持 ARM 多平台 了。在 Linus 的 RC1 开场白中可以看到，这是该版本中的巨大改变！从 Linux 3.7 开始，跨越了十多年的工作，这是多么漫长的过程。



图形和存储升级

存储子系统在各种流行的文件系统中都有性能提升。最主要的变化包括苹果 M1 NVMe 控制器支持和对 XFS 文件系统的更好支持。此外，Btrfs、F2FS 以及 exFAT 文件系统也有增强。

在代码行数方面，有一个令人兴奋的指标是仅是图形驱动程序 Linux 内核 5.19 就增加了大约50 万行代码。它包括 AMD 的 RDNA、CDNA，英特尔的 Raptor Lake、DG2/Alchemist 等图形驱动更新。

重要的网络变化

鉴于数据传输大幅增长，对 Big TCP 的支持有助于支持数据中心 400 GBit 级别的流量。它还可以在高性能网络环境中降低延迟。

继续改进了 多路径 TCPMulti-Path TCP（MPTCP）。此外，高通 ath11k WiFi 驱动程序在此版本中添加了网络唤醒功能。同样增加了对瑞昱的 8852ce 芯片、联发科的 T700 调制解调器以及瑞萨科技的 RZ/V2M 的支持。

其他值得注意的功能

首先，内核中著名的随机函数生成器（RNG）在此版本中 继续 改进。

其次，著名的新兴的 Framework 模块化笔记本电脑获得了此版本 Chrome OS EC 驱动支持。Framework 笔记本现在可以作为一个非 Chromebook 设备利用 ChromeOS 的嵌入式控制器。

此外，Wacom 绘画板以及其他相关设备也有众多更新。包括 对联想 Thinkpad TrackPoint II、谷歌 Whiskers Touchpad、联想 X12 TrackPoint 等设备支持的提升。

Linux 内核 5.19 下载

如果你想要测试并尝试该候选版本，可以在 这里 下载。

预计在 2022 年 7 月左右最终版本发布前，将会有多个版本更迭。

                              <span>去年 9 月，我在荷兰参加了一个中文文化沙龙组织的活动，当时整体分享、讨论的氛围极好。在后半段的提问环节时，有个朋友问了大家一个问题：“生活里我常常被淹没在各种各样的信息里，导致我不断怀疑自己以前做的决定、以及正在做的决定是否是正确的。我应该怎么做，才能坚持自己的选择？或者怎么样才能做出「好的选择」？”
那时我似乎福至心灵，脑海里突然浮现出了我对于这个问题的答案，但是这个答案仿佛只是一个框架、又或者是一幅画，只是处在「心灵语言1」的阶段。但还好借由当时的气氛，我艰难地用语言将答案组织出来了。
当时我没觉得自己的答案多有建设性，但是会议之后至少有两个人过来和我说，我刚才的答案对她们很有帮助。我听后很开心——能够帮助到别人——同时我心里也暗暗记下，这个想法很重要，但还不够成熟、不够逻辑自洽，只是藏在脑海深处的、模糊的一些想法。
但现在，我决定将我脑海里尚且不够清晰，但可以与人分享的内容写下来。而让我产生写下这个想法的契机，是我前段时间读的三本书2，或者说这三本书里提到的想法。这些想法的组合，和我当时在会议上的回答不谋而合。但是借由作者清晰的描述，我似乎也能够将我脑海里的想法描述出来了。我决定借着写这篇文章的机会，希望找到一个答案来回答——我应该怎么与这个世界相处？
问题与答案
「我应该怎么与这个世界相处？」这个问题似乎与文章开头提到的问题不同，但实际上是一个问题。
当我们谈论「与这个世界相处」时，「世界」指的是什么呢？
首先是「别人」，即我们的朋友、家人、爱人、同事、陌生人，乃至我们关注的明星和 influencer。各种各样的人对我们的影响是极大的。父母让我们选择的大学专业、朋友升职的信息、明星代言的品牌、关注的大 V 说的某个观点，这些信息无时无刻不在影响我们对世界的看法。如何与这些人（及背后的信息）相处？
其次是「信息」，关注的新闻、读的书、朋友圈里的信息，这些信息是真是…</span>

Java is a great programming language, but sometimes I want a Java-like language that&#x27;s just a bit more flexible and compact. That&#x27;s when I opt for Groovy.
In a recent article, I reviewed some of the differences between creating and initializing maps in Groovy and doing the same thing in Java. In brief, Groovy has a concise syntax for setting up maps and accessing map entries compared to the effort necessary in Java.
This article will delve into more differences in map handling between Groovy and Java. For that purpose, I will use the sample table of employees used for demoing the JavaScript DataTables library. To follow along, start by making sure you have recent versions o…</span>

                              <span>这次我买了一箱五谷道场“非油炸”方便面，写一写非油炸泡面。

在我前几篇关于泡面的文章中，每每写到非油炸泡面，我总是忍不住揶揄几句，作为一个油炸泡面的忠实拥趸，我不喜欢非油炸泡面的原因有很多，比如大部分非油炸面饼无法干吃，只能泡熟再吃；即使泡熟，非油炸泡面在口感上也不及油炸泡面，这是大多数非油炸面饼与生俱来的劣势；最重要的是，非油炸泡面因为面饼的干燥工艺成本高，价格往往更贵。以五谷道场泡面为例，在拼多多上，每盒价格在6.5元左右，而合味道和汤达人泡面的价格每盒不超过5元，统一和康师傅的泡面更是3元不到，油炸泡面显然更具性价比。
非油炸泡面优点是更加健康，与油炸面饼相比，非油炸泡面的干燥工艺不经过油炸，面饼油脂含量更低，但二者差多少呢？我根据泡面的“营养成分表”，特意做了记录。
在非油炸泡面中，以我购买的四包五谷道场泡面汤面为例（拌面因为酱料等原因，脂肪含量高于汤面），他们的脂肪含量分别为：酸笋肥牛面，5.0g/100g；剁椒鱼头面，6.8g/100g；酸汤老鸭面，6.8g/100g；豉汁辣排面，6.8g/100g。以一个简单粗暴的方式取平均值，每百克脂肪含量大概是6.35g/100g。
而油炸泡面的脂肪含量以康师傅和统一经典的几款泡面为例，康师傅红烧牛肉面，25.5g/100g；香辣牛肉面，27.1g/100g；藤椒牛肉面，25.3g/100g。统一香辣牛肉面，22.9g/100g；红烧牛肉面，22.8g/100g；泡椒牛肉面，21.9g/100g。取平均值为24.25g/100g。
每百克非油炸泡面的脂肪含量要比油炸泡面低17.9g，而一包袋装泡面重量刚好在100g左右，因而每包非油炸泡面的脂肪含量要比油炸泡面少17.9g，或者说，油炸泡面的脂肪含量是非油炸泡面的四倍。

@甜食：先锋 Pioneer BD-RW XD07 USB 光驱 

入手渠道：闲鱼
入手价格：285 元

前段时间，我的旧光驱坏了。作为一个较为频繁购买 CD、不那么频繁但一年总会买几次 DVD 或者蓝光影碟的人，我只能马上开始物色一个新的光驱。对于光驱这样的产品，可能每个用户的出发点和使用需求都不太一样，为了让这篇文章对各位读者能更有一些参考价值，我先把我自己的需求，也就是我挑选时的一些选择指标列在这里：

我购买 CD 和影碟的几乎 100% 场景是为了获取内容，也就是「这张盘里的音乐 / 影视我在网上没法找到数字版」。光碟到手之后的第一件事就是把里面的内容妥善地通过抓轨保存到自己的硬盘里，不会直接通过光驱来听音乐或看电影，因此这方面的功能能省则省，可以完全忽略；
因为抓轨的过程并不长，也不需要我在旁边盯着，所以光驱的速度和噪音等因素对我来说并不重要；
因为「获取内容」是主要目的，所以我希望光驱有足够的兼容性，上至蓝光下至 VCD，我也许一年也不会买一次，但当我真的需要买的时候，我希望这台光驱可以派上用场，所以兼容性是第一位的。

其实我买上一台光驱的时候，需求和上面所写的并无太大区别。对于 CD 和 DVD，可以说今天市面上只要是能转的光驱都可以支持，最后影响决策的重点就落在了蓝光的兼容性上：作为比较新的光盘介质，一旦把蓝光加入到需要兼容的格式中，淘宝上五花八门的光驱选择面一下子就变少了许多。
目前，网上可以买到的支持蓝光的外接光驱大致有两种。第一种是「正规大厂」所生产的款式，例…</span>

Wallet 作为 iOS 自带应用，在很多人的 iPhone 上使用频率并不算高，除了交通卡和偶尔刷银联卡进行支付，在大陆地区它的作用实在是非常有限。
但很多人可能不知道的是，Wallet 的功能可能远比微信卡包强大。理想状态下，它甚至可以将家门钥匙、门禁、会员卡甚至身份证都统统塞入 iPhone 或手腕上的 Apple Watch 里，而且只要电源键「滴答」两下就可以优雅地出示。
如果你想为钱包应用添加更多 Wallet 票卡，这篇文章将介绍使用 Pass2U 和 MakePass 制作最简单的静态码会员卡、登机牌等票卡的操作方法，让你在收银台的时候不用手忙脚乱地寻找会员小程序或者 App。
Pass2U
Pass2U 是一家台湾地区的公司做出的软件服务，它主营业务是面向小微商家、企业制作、发放会员卡、集点卡等会员管理服务。在有着完整 Google 服务的国家和地区，Pass2U 可以在 iOS、Android 上无需下载额外软件即可无感分发会员卡。Pass2U 也在 App Store 提供了面向个人用户的 Wallet 票卡制作 App，免费版可以使用其中有限的功能，在港区商店花费 15 港元即可解锁专业版。
在此部分内我会分别介绍 App 内制作与网页端制作的一些范例，以及我觉得各位在制作时需要注意的点。
 
在移动端 Pass2U 的主界面点击右下角的加号按钮，即可开始创建 Wallet 票卡。Pass2U 支持扫描、输入或提取现有票卡照片中的条码来快速套用样式，除此之外，如果选择「套用票卡样式」，则能在内置的…</span>

                              <span>这是一张我一直珍藏在手机里的照片，2017 年，少数派很荣幸的被邀请到美国现场参见 WWDC 大会，并参与了 Apple 设计奖的颁奖和报道，作为一个名不见经传的小媒体来说确实难得，也算是对我们前五年坚持推荐优质付费应用的一个小小认可。

从这一年开始，一张图看懂 WWDC 就成了我们的招牌菜，用最简洁、最漂亮的设计，诠释大会关键信息，别小看这一张图，都是在半夜三点到六点之间做完的，通常都要两三个同事一起熬通宵，我虽然不参与设计，也会尽量陪着，做一些社交传播工作。
也就是这一次，我才了解到苹果设计奖的一些标准关键词：Usability（易用性）、Design（设计）、Innovation （创新），Technology（技术应用）。而我们在 2014 年，就基于用户的角度，总结了少数派报道和推荐产品的四个标准关键词：「原创，优美，实用，有趣」，并把它们标注在网站的页脚。

我没想到两个标准会有这么高的重合度，虽然看起来非常的巧合，但实际上，这是平台方希望保持「用户角度」的相同初心。这几个字说起来简单，但面对商业世界就非常的不容易。因为要坚持这样的推荐报道原则，我们放弃了很多广告投放的机会，商业化进展缓慢，终于在用完第一笔投资之后，进入严重的经营困难，不得不大幅收缩团队，转型拓展。而这个痛苦阶段，就在我们第一次受邀参加 WWDC 大会的一个月之后。
现实就是如此，台前的辉煌不一定被看到，但幕后的痛苦你一个也躲不掉。

从 2017 到 2019 年，少数派连续三次被邀请到美国现场报道 WWDC，随着经验丰富，我们也做了更多的准备。2019 年现场采访了很多开发者，录制了一些现场视频，那一年，我们刚刚建立视频内容小组，开始拓展一些新的形式。虽然拍摄和剪辑比较稚嫩，但内容还算是干货满满。
随后两年，疫情来了，WWDC 也都改成了线上录播，虽然缺少了线下的仪式感，但我们还是保持着熬夜报道和制作一图流的习惯。对于我这个四十出头的中年人来说，熬一次夜还是挺伤身的，但这既是工作，也是爱好，痛并快乐着。
近两年，随着智能手机销量的下降，国产品牌的追赶，WWDC 的关注度似乎也在减退，因为用户希望看到更多惊喜，而现实是硬件和应用创新都进入了瓶颈期。这次 WWDC 2022，苹果生态的价值开始被展现出来，四个大的 OS 都基本完善了，开始进行相互打通，比如 iPhone 和 Mac 电脑的相机协同，比如 macOS 的台前调度被整合到 iPadOS，还有深度调用车机信息的全新 CarPlay，这里不是简单的把设备捏在一块，而是基于用户的场景需求，提供最佳的组合方案，多年构建的生态壁垒又一次拉开了苹果与其他对手的距离。
但回想一下，苹果这个生态是怎么来的呢？首先你不能跟风，而是要站在用户的角度，去做未来的布局；其次你不能贪婪，要放弃短期利益，去构建长期的用户信任；最后你不能偷懒，要保证每一个产品和服务的体验，不断累加产品力。除了这些基础的工作，还要应对开发者关系、投资者收益、供应链管理等一系列的考验，所以具有壁垒的生态不是喊出来的，是一步一步做出来的。

一转眼，五年又过去了，很庆幸少数派还在，并且建立了基础的商业闭环，而苹果已经成为了全球最具价值的公司，我们也又一次参与了 WWDC 和苹果设计奖的采访报道。这五年里，很多外部事物都变了，但更多底层的东西并没有变。</span>

                              <span>GitHub 正式宣布终止 Atom 项目

GitHub 是在 2011 年宣布 Atom，2015 年 5 月发布了 1.0 版本，并吸引了数百万开发者使用。而微软在 2015 年推出的 VS Code 也是受到了 Atom 的启发。在 2018 年微软收购 GitHub 后，Atom 成为了微软的项目。在社区对 Atom 前景的担忧之下，GitHub 承诺不会放弃 Atom。但过去几年 Atom 除了安全更新外几乎没有什么改进。而 Atom 和 VS Code 的用户数此消彼长，Stack Overflow 的 2021 年度开发者调查结果表明，仅 13% 开发者将 Atom 当做主力开发环境，而 VS Code 却高达 71%。最后，Atom 还留下了一个重要遗产，它所分拆出来的 Electron 框架被数以千计的应用广泛使用，其中包括 VS Code、Slack 和 GitHub Desktop 等等。

老王点评：其实可以想到，当年社区对 GitHub 被收购的担忧并非无的放矢。可惜了 Atom，至今我还对 Atom 1.0 那时候的那个 宣传视频 记忆尤深。








IETF 正式颁布 HTTP/3 推荐标准 RFC 9114

作为超文本传输协议的第三个大版本，它确定了 QUIC 包含的 HTTP/2 功能，并描述了如何将 HTTP/2 扩展迁移至 HTTP/3。QUIC 全称为“快速 UDP 互联网连接”，由谷歌创建并于 2013 年发布。其旨在化解 TCP 需要多次来回握手，才能建立连接并开始传输数据的短板。早在 IETF 颁布 HTTP/3 的意见征求稿前，谷歌就已经将 QUIC 支持内嵌于 Chrome 浏览器，并在谷歌的诸多服务上启用。Web 流量观测表明 HTTP/3 的流量已超过 HTTP/1.1。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我记得 HTTP/2 也不过才几年，现在都要开始普及 HTTP/3。真是风水轮流转，谁想到最主要的互联网应用 HTTP 最终会从 TCP 转向 UDP 呢。




谷歌再次打破圆周率计算纪录，计算出百万亿位

早在 2019 年，谷歌云服务就已经打破了圆周率的计算纪录，计算出了 31.4 万亿位。周三，谷歌云再次宣布打破了百万亿位的圆周率计算纪录。这 百万亿位圆周率 的最后 10 位是：30952 95560。谷歌云表示，其借助计算引擎服务完成了本次新挑战，用到了 N2 机器家族、虚拟网卡、100 Gbps 网络带宽，以及平衡持久磁盘等新功能。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：看似无用的圆周率计算，其实是谷歌云一次炫技的展示。有人说，任何大小的数字都能在圆周率的某个片段找到。不说百万亿位了，你能背出多少位圆周率呢？</span>

                              <span>编译软件在你如何运行你的系统方面给你很大的灵活性。LD_LIBRARY_PATH 变量，以及 GCC 的 -L 和 -l 选项，是这种灵活性的组成部分。


编译软件是开发者经常做的事情，在开源世界中，一些用户甚至选择自己动手。Linux 播客 Dann Washko 称源码为“通用包格式”，因为它包含了使一个应用在任何平台上运行所需的所有组件。当然，并不是所有的源码都是为所有的系统编写的，所以它只是在目标系统的子集内是“通用”的，但问题是，源码是非常灵活的。有了开源，你可以决定代码的编译和运行方式。

当你在编译代码时，你通常要处理多个源文件。开发人员倾向于将不同的类或模块放在不同的文件中，这样它们可以被单独维护，甚至可能被不同的项目使用。但当你编译这些文件时，许多文件会被编译成一个可执行文件。

这通常是通过创建共享库来完成的，然后从可执行文件中动态链接回它们。这样可以通过保持模块化功能的外部性来保持可执行文件的小型化，并确保库可以独立于使用它们的应用而被更新。

在编译过程中定位一个共享对象

当你 用 GCC 编译 时，你通常需要在你的工作站上安装一个库，以便 GCC 能够定位到它。默认情况下，GCC 假定库在系统库路径中，例如 /lib64 和 /usr/lib64。然而，如果你要链接到一个你自己的尚未安装的库，或者你需要链接到一个没有安装在标准位置的库，那么你必须帮助 GCC 找到这些文件。

有两个选项对于在 GCC 中寻找库很重要：


-L（大写字母 L）在 GCC 的搜索位置上增加一个额外的库路径。

-l（小写字母 L）设置你要链接的库的名字。


例如，假设你写了一个叫做 libexample.so 的库，并且你想在编译你的应用 demo.c 时使用它。首先，从 demo.c 创建一个对象文件：

$ gcc -I ./in…</span>

                              <span>机器学习基本上是人工智能的一个子集，它使用以前存在的数据对新数据进行预测。


当然，现在我们所有人都知道这个道理了！这篇文章展示了如何将 Python 中开发的机器学习模型作为 Java 代码的一部分来进行预测。



本文假设你熟悉基本的开发技巧并理解机器学习。我们将从训练我们的模型开始，然后在 Python 中制作一个机器学习模型。

我以一个洪水预测模型为例。首先，导入以下库：

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


当我们成功地导入了这些库，我们就需要输入数据集，如下面的代码所示。为了预测洪水，我使用的是河流水位数据集。

from google.colab import files
uploaded &#x3D; files.upload()
for fn in uploaded.keys(): 
    print(&#x27;User uploaded file &quot;{name}&quot; with length {length} bytes&#x27;.format(name&#x3D;fn, length&#x3D;len(uploaded[fn])))


如果没有选择文件的话，选择上传的文件。

只有在当前浏览器会话中执行了该单元格时，上传部件才可用。请重新运行此单元，上传文件 Hoppers Crossing-Hourly-River-Level.csv，大小 2207036 字节。

完成后，我们就可以使用 sklearn 库来训练我们的模型。为此，我们首先需要导入该库和算法模型，如图 1 所示。



from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor &#x3D; LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)


完成后，我们就训练好了我们的模型，现在可以进行预测了，如图 2 所示。



在 Java 中使用 ML 模型

我们现在需要做的是把 ML 模型转换成一个可以被 Java 程序使用的模型。有一个叫做 sklearn2pmml 的库可以帮助我们做到这一点：

# Install the library
pip install sklearn2pmml


库安装完毕后，我们就可以转换我们已经训练好的模型，如下图所示：

sklearn2pmml(pipeline, ‘model.pmml’, with_repr &#x3D; True)


这就完成了！我们现在可以在我们的 Java 代码中使用生成的 model.pmml 文件来进行预测。请试一试吧！

（LCTT 译注：Java 中有第三方库 jpmml/jpmml-evaluator，它能帮助你使用生成的 model.pmml 进行预测。）

Open source reading and editing tools for PDFs are often more secure and reliable alternatives to the applications residing in the first pages of &quot;PDF editor&quot; search results. There, you&#x27;re likely to see proprietary applications with hidden limitations and tariffs, lacking sufficient information about data protection policies and hosting. You can have better.
Here are five applications that can be installed on your Linux system (and others) or hosted on a server. Each is free and open source, with all the necessary features for creating, editing, and annotating PDF files.

The term orchestration is relatively new to the IT industry, and it still has nuance that eludes or confuses people who don&#x27;t spend all day orchestrating. When I describe orchestration to someone, it usually sounds like I&#x27;m just describing automation. That&#x27;s not quite right. In fact, I wrote a whole article differentiating automation and orchestration.
An easy way to think about it is that orchestration is just a form of automation. To understand how you can benefit from orchestration, it helps to understand what specifically it automates.

                              <span>这篇文章是我去年在公司内部的分享，当时Constraintlayout2.0还没Release，所以只在公司内部进行了分享，希望等Release之后，就可以正式在项目中使用了。
那么为什么我这么热衷于使用constraintlayout呢？从团队项目来说，3年前我刚进公司的时候，做了一次Constraintlayout1.0的分享，让大家了解到了这一强大的布局方式，大家也认识到了这一神器的强大，从那以后，constraintlayout在项目中的使用越来越广泛，以前可能需要很多代码计算才能实现的布局效果，利用Constraintlayout，可能一行Java代码都不用写，直接在XML布局中就能实现，这也体现了科技提高生产力的强大优势。
如果说Constraintlayout1.0是对静态布局的革命，那么这次Constraintlayout2.0的升级，则是对布局中的动画进行了革命，这是对Constraintlayout1.0布局基本形式的强大补充，至此，Constraintlayout几乎可以完全替代原始的布局方式，同时让动画的实现变的异常方便，所以，我会花几篇文章来阐述Constraintlayout2.0的革命之处。
不过，为了偷懒，这篇文章直接使用了去年中分享的内容，当时Constraintlayout2.0还未Release，所以可能有些地方和正式版本有些区别，不过不影响，因为整体是一致的。
这是本系列的第一篇文章，简述了Constraintlayout中MotionLayout的基本使用。

一、前言
FlutterUnit  虽然支持六端，但分为了三个分支：移动端和桌面端以及 web 端。这是由于历史遗留问题，起初 Flutter 稳定版 SDK 是不支持桌面开发，需要  master 版本的 SDK，在那时 FlutterUnit 就已经开始支持桌面版。为了让移动端在 稳定版 SDK 上开发符合大多数人的场景，所以选择新建分支让桌面端用  master 版本的 SDK 尝鲜体验。

一直以来 FlutterUnit 偏重于移动端，桌面端和 web 端基本处于能跑就像的状态。不过最近 Flutter 桌面端也在逐渐发展，windows 和 macOS 官方也已经宣布稳定支持。很多三方插件也支持了桌面版，越来越多的朋友开始向 Flutter 桌面端尝试，感觉也是时候将 桌面端 和 移动端 的代码进行合并。顺便记录一下其中需要注意的要点。
想要让一个只有 Android/iOS 的 Flutter 项目支持 windows ，只需要在项目根目录执行：
flutter create .

这样即可生成其他平台的源码文件，这里暂时不集成 web ，可以删掉。

二、SQLite 数据库的全平台支持
sqflite  目前已经支持了 Android、 iOS,  和 MacOS 平台；对 Windows 和 Linux 的支持，可以使用 sqflite_common_ffi

----&gt;[pubspec.yaml]----
dependencies:
  #...
sqflite: ^2.0.2+1 # 数据库
  sqflite_common_ffi: ^2.1.1 # 数据库

                              <span>作为专业骑行科技厂商，佳明的码表占有率极高，尤其是在520时代，一群人出来骑车520一定是最多的。

事实上，520从来都不是一个很好用的自行车码表，佳明自己也很清楚这一点，只是仗着自己强大的GPS技术为所欲为，所以在间隔期也就出了一个520Plus来撑撑场面。再加上相较佳明，友商们不争气啊，给了机会抓不住。国产陷入了手机APP打造所谓生态圈的邪路，手机APP用着是方便是流畅屏幕还大，但是我真的不想骑车的时候在车头架个iPhone，先不说我那一体把能不能架风阻有多大，你说我要是摔车了是先捡手机还是先扶车还是先看人呢？简简单单的放个码表不好吗，续航还长还不怕风吹日晒。好不容易出个码表功能残缺不全，连支持个TSS都成了卖点。

而曾经凑合还能用的百锐腾不知道怎么就掉队了，新来的wahoo倒是抓住了佳明反人类软件设计这个痛点给佳明狠狠的捅了一刀，和手机无缝连接的感觉像是当年第一次用上智能手机，只是不知道为什么文字翻译非要用百度，好好的功率改个名字叫“翼”，都是些什么鬼……好吧，虽然520设定起来是很蛋疼，按键手感也很糟糕但好歹只需要设定一次，天天看着机翻实在是辣眼睛。能把520从王座上掀下了的还只能是佳明自己。于是，他们推出了520真正的换代产品Edge 530，顺便把年轻的820一起换成了830。

那么问题又来了，买哪个？530和830在功能上好像没什么区别啊，在官网上除了一个支持触屏一个不支持外根本看不出有什么区别，选择困难症要犯了，还是老办法，同类不同级买贵的，同级不同类就都买。于是就有了这篇530和830的对比评测。

先上结论，这一代530和830的不同只在于操作方法和逻辑，功能上几乎一模一样。嗯，就这一点让830比530贵了将近一倍。不同于上一代里只有820有完整的导航功能，这一代530内置了和830一毛一样的导航系统，从机内文件可以看出连地图都是一样的，相比于52…</span>

On most systems, there are several ways to install software. Which one you use depends on the source of the application you&#x27;re installing. Some software comes as a downloadable wizard to walk you through an install process, while others are files you just download and run immediately.
On macOS, a whole library of open source applications is available from Unix commands like Homebrew and MacPorts. The advantage of using commands for software installation is that you can automate them, and my favorite tool for automation is Ansible. Combining Ansible with Homebrew is an efficient and reproducible way to install your favorite open source applicat…</span>

一直在小公司徘徊，在小团队里面摸爬滚打。面试中往往会被面试官对于一些平时用不到的技能细致追问，想要跳高只能开始学习工作中用不到的技能，不然就会陷入死循环怪圈
你没这块工作经验，单位不要。
又因为没单位要，所以就没有工作经验。
所以只能自己偷偷默默学习，以demo当作经验。
名词解释
双亲委派机制 ：在类加载器中，指的是当一个类加载器收到了类加载的请求的时候，他不会直接去加载指定的类，而是把这个请求委托给自己的父加载器去加载。 只有父加载器无法加载这个类的时候，才会由当前这个加载器来负责类的加载。

插件化一直都没有尝试过。听起来高大上，重要的是面试中被问到的概率也是居高不下。
在开发过程中，不用安装app就能运行新的apk是多么美妙的事情，插件化对于我们的工程应用也有实际意义。本文就以compose Demo项目完整实现一下插件化。完成插件的生成装载，并成功跳转展示对应的插件页面。
一，插件化的方案
在Android中，真正安装一个apk的过程很简单，就只是将apk文件拷贝到对应的目录中，并且解压出对应的so文件就好了，其余就是一些解析，扫描组件，校验，dex优化的操作，用户安装包都是拷贝存放在data/app中。

TextView文本大小自动适配与TextView边距的去除
标题太难取了，其实本文主要就是讲如何控制文本大小，让其自动适配宽度，其次我们还需要精准控制Text的高度和宽度间距等属性。
一般我们的布局都是分 match parent 和 wrap content 而他们的自动方式又有所不同。下面看看都有哪些方式来实现！
一、Autosizing的方式(固定宽度)
官方推出的TextView的Autosizing方式，在宽度固定的情况下，可以设置最大文本Size和最小文本Size和每次缩放粒度，非常方便的就能实现该功能。
 

autoSizeTextType：设置 TextView 是否支持自动改变文本大小，none 表示不支持，uniform 表示支持。
autoSizeMinTextSize：最小文字大小，例如设置为10sp，表示文字最多只能缩小到10sp。
autoSizeMaxTextSize：最大文字大小，例如设置为18sp，表示文字最多只能放大到18sp。
autoSizeStepGranularity：缩放粒度，即每次文字大小变化的数值，例如设置为1sp，表示每次缩小或放大的值为1sp。
效果：

如果在Java代码中使用，我们也可以这么用
TextView tvText &#x3D; findViewById(R.id.tv_text);
TextViewCompat.setAutoSizeTextTypeWithDefaults(tvText,TextViewCompat.AUTO_SIZE_TEXT_TYPE_UNIFORM);
TextViewCompat.setAutoSizeTextTypeUniformWithConfiguratio…</span>

                              <span>Retrofit框架之美
  在众多安卓网络请求框架中，Retrofit无疑是最耀眼的那个：基于okhttp实现，迁移成本低、API设计简洁易用、注解化配置高度解耦、支持多种解析器、支持rxjava和协程。。。
  然而实际项目中，Retrofit有诸多不便，例如：返回值Call容易陷入嵌套地域、网上大多数CallAdapter方案需要手动try-catch、缺乏全局逻辑等。不过好消息是，得益于Retrofit强大的定制功能，我们可以逐一解决上诉的痛点，让Retrofit从一个花瓶变成一个具有实战意义的工具。
我们的目标是让Retrofit拥有以下功能和特性：
在协程下执行网络请求，让异步请求代码变成近似同步代码，消除嵌套地狱
网络API的注解自定义和逻辑自定义
增加可配置的全局结果转换器，例如返回的成功报文中，含有code为非0的结果，需要转换成错误的报文
网络请求方法不用手动try-catch异常，即方法不向上抛出，方法返回值包含网络异常
阅读本系列需要以下知识点：
kotlin
Hilt（最好了解）
Retrofit（基础或者使用过即可）
okhttp（了解拦截器的使用）

一：分析问题
  默认情况下，Retrofit支持Call的返回值，我们需要调用Call类中的方法来请求网络，然后通过回调来获取网络请求的成功和失败的结果。
    interface IGetRequest {
        @GET(&quot;xxxxxx&quot;)
        fun getStudent(): Call
    }


    call.enqueue(object : Callback {
            override fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {

我在推荐 Notion 的时候，总是会提起 Notion 更适合大屏使用，这不仅是因为数据库的数据一旦多了，在手机屏幕上看就显得很局促，更是因为一旦数据多又遇上网络原因，Notion 在手机上加载的速度会变慢。
我目前不仅使用 Notion 作为主力的知识管理笔记软件，把正在学习的知识记录在 Notion 上，同时，Notion 也是我的 GTD 管理软件，我倾向于把待办事项或转瞬即逝的灵感记录在 Notion 对应页面里，方便事后直接对事项进行管理和追踪。
比如说，我不再在豆瓣上标记想看或正在看的电影条目，转而在 Notion 上新建一个数据库对它们进行管理。
这个时候，问题就来了。如果我刚好没有正在使用电脑，却需要在 Notion 里记录我想看某一部电影，但我的片单数据库很庞大，我受够了等待 Notion App 缓慢的加载，我不需要查看整个数据库，却要等待整个数据库加载完成。我就在想，有没有什么更快捷直接的方式可以让我不用打开 App 又可以往 Notion 发送数据呢？
于是我想起了「iOS 快捷指令」。
iOS 快捷指令
iOS 快捷指令是什么？对少数派的读者来说，想必是再熟悉不过了，我就不多介绍了。
在使用快捷指令往 Notion 发送数据的过程中，我们可能会用到这四个操作。
第一个是「要求输入」。这个操作会弹出一个对话框，要求用户输入信息。如果我们要发送到 Notion 的数据是自己手动输入的话，就可以用上它。

第二个是「获取剪贴板」。这个操作会把你刚刚复制的内容传递到下一个操作里。如果我们要把复制的内容发…</span>

                              <span>为什么要这么做？
昨天在推上看到一个视频，注意到他是使用 Sony ZV1 作为直播摄像头的。而作为一个视频制作者，我的不少视频都是以真人 + 教程的形式提供给我的观众的，我突然想起来，或许我可以使用手机来作为摄像头来完成视频的录制。
和 MBP 自带的摄像头相比，可以让我在视频中更加清晰、更加明亮，让我的视频的观众们可以更好的看到我（没错，就是这么自恋）。于是，我决定用我的备用机 — Pixel 6 来完成这个操作。
为什么是 Iriun Webcam
Iriun Webcam 的一个好处是免费版可以使用 4K，且免费版的水印也十分的不明显，对于白嫖用户十分友好。如果你需要完全去除水印或更加强大的控制能力，则可以付费获得。不过对于绝大多数场景，免费版足矣。
所需软件

macOS 驱动下载：https://iriun.com/
Android Play Store 应用：https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.jacksoftw.webcam
iOS App Store 应用：https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iriun-webcam-for-pc-and-mac/id1439303579?mt&#x3D;8

所需硬件

与手机适配的 USB 数据线：如果本地网络速度足够快，也可以不使用数据线。不过我推荐你使用 USB 数据线，主要是理论上会更加的稳定。

操作流程
安装软件
PC 端
想要实现软件连接，需要先下载安装相应的软件。Iriun Webcam 支持 WIndows 、 macOS 和 Ubuntu ，你只需要访问其官网，并下载对应的软件，并在本地进行安装即可

手机端
手机端则可以在你的手机上搜索 Irirun webcam，并进行安装。

配置设备连接
安装完成后，在 macOS 上打开 Iriun Webcam 会看到如下的界面，此时说明你的 PC 已经准备好了。

未连接状态的效果
在手机上打开同样的软件，稍等片刻，二者就会自动连接到一起

已连接状态的效果
换用 USB 连接
使用 Wi-Fi 连接的最大的问题是不稳定，以及延迟高。因此，你可以选择改用 USB 数据线进行连接，从而获得一个更低的延迟和更稳定的视频效果。
你需要先将自己的手机开启开发者选项，并开启「USB 调试」，随后将手机与电脑连接（如果有授权窗口，则授权 PC 进行调试）。

授权完成后，稍等片刻软件就会自动刷新，手机后的「Wi-Fi」变为「USB」，则说明你已经成功切换为使用 USB 连接。

配置软件摄像头
当你配置完成 Iriun 的 Webcam 之后，就可以在你日常使用的软件当中切换具体使用的摄像头为 Iriun Webcam 来获得从手机取得的视频画面。

腾讯会议的摄像头选择框
如果你使用 OBS 的话，还可以将音频输入修改为 Iriun Webcam audio （腾讯会议并不支持），来获取手机当中传递过来的音频信号。

总结
使用手机摄像头来替代 Mac Book Pro 上自带的摄像头可以帮助我们获得一个更好的画质和视频观看体验。相比于购买一个全新的摄像头，不妨用上你的旧手机来完成你的直播诉求。而你所需要的，不过是一款免费软件 + 一根 USB 数据线。</span>

博客探索
2005 年，我开始用博客记录感想，发布在 MSN space 平台和短命的 Google Sidewiki 上。六年后，MSN space 关闭 ，博客被转移到 WordPress 托管，我改用 Blogger，没多久就暂停了博客。
2018 年，我偶然接触到 Jekyll，被其简洁的界面和便捷性打动，重新恢复了博客记录。博客方向从感想记录转变到知识整理输出。Jekyll 方案需要首先在本地用 Markdown 编辑排版，然后同步到 GitHub 发布，最后以 Markdown 格式手动分发到各个渠道。当文章较少时，这套方案的体验感特别好。
到了 2021 年，随着文章和发布渠道的增多，文章的修改和管理变得愈加困难。慢慢地，我开始习惯本地 Markdown 只做初稿排版，更新则只在外部平台上进行。
我的文章都是工具教程类，要随着工具的更新而修改，有时甚至要对几年前发布的文章进行更新。因此，针对少量平台更新的策略，带来了文章版本混乱，让博客偏离了知识记录的初衷。为了保证文章版本统一，我把博客从 Jekyll 迁移到 WordPress，准备以 WordPress 作为统一版。

然而，WordPress 方案很快就被放弃了。原因除了 WordPress 糟糕的编辑体验，更重要的是，我遇到了 Notion。其界面美观，编辑方便，支持对外展示，能导出为 Markdown、HTML 文件。
可是，没什么平台是完美的。Notion 不支持同步本地 markdown 内容，图床不能在站外使用，国内访问速度成谜。这令 Notion…</span>

                              <span>今年还要再去一次三亚！
这可能是我和女友自去年六月三亚回来之后，说的最多的愿望了。去年六月初，我们俩人趁着旅游旺季还没来临之前，特地请了4天的假期，搭上一个端午假期，才终于让我们期盼已久的海岛之旅成行。（辛苦打工人年中旅游实属不易啊🥲 ）
迟到了一年的海岛漫游指南，希望能给今年的你提供一些帮助。
海边日落-三亚湾
行前准备：天气预报可能是最不需要的东西🌤
5月中旬-10月中旬是海南的雨季，而且往往伴随着各类热带气旋的光临。我从做攻略开始就非常担心去玩的那一周天天下雨。如果你去查未来15天三亚天气预报，通常会看到这样一个劝退人的画面：
海南三亚6月未来15天天气预报
但其实海南的热带气候还是非常靠谱的。
预报下雨的一天可能只会间歇性地下1-2个小时的阵雨。趁着下雨在酒店瘫一会儿，出门就又是大太阳了。因此，千万别被天气预报劝退，在海南的雨季，一般的天气预报可能是最不需要的东西。我们去的那周甚至遇上了台风天，但是半天的狂风暴雨之后，一切正常。
唯一需要注意的就是要注意避开台风天入岛或出岛，以免长时间的途中延误。
怎么走：自驾，应该是体验海岛的最佳选择🚗
不同的出入岛方式可能会有不小的成本差异。
我们的选择是：
入岛路线：上海 - 直飞 - 三亚
出岛路线：三亚 - 高铁 - 海口；海口 - 直飞 - 上海
比起往返直飞三亚，可以省下约1000元的旅费。
出入岛的排列组合方式非常丰富，从海口到三亚的动车只需1.5小时，因此完全可以根据你的情况考虑海南的各个机场出入岛。
海南岛内交通示意
而对于岛内的出行，我个人只推荐一种：自驾。
三亚市内公共交通并不发达，而且大部分景点都在中心城区范围之外。
不论是公交还是打车，都会旅途带来不少的麻烦和不便。如果你有计划去免税店逛逛，我强烈建议自驾前往。免税店门口总有一堆人在排队打车，如果真的打车出行非常影响购物体验。
相对的，三亚的租车行业…</span>

Writers are always looking for better ways to put their words and ideas into readable formats to share with their readers. My first experiences with word processing came in my Apple II days when I used AppleWorks and later FrEDWriter, which was a free word processing application created in 1985. It was the standard for my students, many of whom came from households that lacked the money to purchase proprietary software.

When I made the switch to Linux in the late 1990&#x27;s, I was looking for high quality writing software that I could use and recommend to students who chose to follow my lead in the world of open source software. The first word processor I became fam…</span>

The following article is a companion to my presentation at Drupalcon and Drupalcamp covering Progressive Web Apps implementations.
Progressive Web Apps (PWA) have support from some of the top tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, with the common goal being &quot;Web apps should be able to do anything iOS, Android, or desktop apps can.&quot; PWAs can add value to businesses at a variety of different stages. All projects have limitations, whether they be development resources, timeline, budget, or technical debt. Even with &quot;unlimited resources,&quot; developing an app from a single codebase, using commonly known web technologies, allows for a more frictionless, san…</span>

                              <span>这是一篇万字长文，主要涉及以下三个部分：
第一部分：理解对方。相较于《非暴力沟通》中的观察、行动、感受、请求等步骤的目的是通过用非暴力的表达方式让对方理解自己，即将介绍的「知觉检核」技巧更加倾向于带着一种开放的态度尝试去理解对方；第二部分：管理情绪。情绪看似是外力作用的结果，其实是知觉产生的想法所导致的结果；第三部分：展现自我。虽然自我的概念在很大程度上是由天性决定的，但在沟通的过程中可以被塑造，「自我袒露」的深度和广度决定着一段关系的亲密程度。
先对上篇文章《沟通的艺术｜学校错过的课程，现在补上也不晚》中提到的沟通的定义做个简单回顾：

人际沟通是一个交流的过程，其参与者们处于不同但又有所重叠的背景下，经由交换信息来创造价值和建立关系，过程中会受到外在、生理和心理的噪音干扰。

「不同背景」是沟通中客观存在的前提条件，「交换信息」是在沟通的过程中我们主动进行的行为，而「创造价值和建立关系」是我们「交换信息」的目的，或者是沟通这个行为产生的结果。上篇文章详细介绍了沟通的定义，和在「交换信息」时起到先导作用的「倾听」的技巧和注意事项。本篇文章的重点则是「交换信息」时本身的动作，了解人们理解信息的一般过程，以及「噪音干扰」会对「创造价值和关系」造成什么影响。
理想中的沟通

当我们倾听对方说话时，如果能意识到双方有着不同的背景，就可以明白为什么对方的某些行为让自己觉得无法理喻：因为不同的「教育/生活背景」差异会导致两人的知觉产生巨大的偏差。通过使用「知觉检核」技巧可以准确地理解对方；如果能意识到沟通会受到噪音干扰，我们就可以理解为什么在情绪上头时进行的沟通往往会造成让人后悔莫及的结果，因为我们的大脑会受到愤怒等「生理噪音」的干扰从而变的不那么理智。通过了解正确的「情绪管理」技巧能够帮助我们识别自己和对方的情绪并加以控制。
当我们尝试说服对方时，如果能意识到沟通会受噪音干扰，就可…</span>

                              <span>距离上一次更新，已经是两周前。因为换了个新环境，也需要处理很多事情，所以时间很紧，无法像之前那样有大把的时间获取和筛选各种信息、思考和主题式写作。
如果一个问题和道理总是反复出现在自己的反思里，那么这个问题就会逐渐得到自己的重视。我在 2 个多月以前，我也因为搬家没有时间写作，产生了焦虑。
焦虑的本质原因是「期待自我」与「现实自我」产生了较大距离。内心期待自己能每周更新深度的带有主题的内容，但现实的自我却因为时间紧做不到，而我又接受不了停更。
所以我的解决办法是：调整「期待自我」。去感受当下正在做事的价值。不苛责自己，顺应情绪脑和直觉，因为能轻易驱动身体这台沉重的机器的不是「理性脑」，而是「情绪脑」、「本能脑」，又因人作为动物，容易受环境影响，所以用心感受当下才能活得更自如。
我的笔记截图
让自己产生写作灵感的提问机器，往往藏在自己的亲历而非臆想中。我当时在搬家的时候，也曾深刻体会了「把指数型问题拆解成线型问题」的方法。
同样的，虽然最近没有时间去看更多的书籍和文章，但我仍然可以把我来到义乌的所见所闻，整理成一些可以分享的内容，给你看。一来，可以和正在阅读的你保持联系；二来，我也希望自己能通过完整文章的方式来整理我最近的思绪，让思考流动起来。
特别感谢我的女友，她给我说：你的专业的内容挺难读的，大家关心的其实不仅是你的内容，而是你这个活生生的人，你可以分享你的经历，即使不是事件的参与者，也能成为一个观察者。这有鼓励到我去摆脱之前的束缚，按照自己的意愿来分享自己所见所想。
接下来，我就试着分享一些我在新来的城市——义乌的所见所闻。
🏠 义乌的租房
来义乌住下酒店后，我们一边处理新的仓库工作，一边找房子。义乌租房和其它地方不一样，大多按年租来付款的。如果想按月租，只能去城中村的库存街里去问。

                              <span>从去年传出退出中国流言开始，到近期靴子落地，宣布正式退出中国，Kindle这个过于专注的电子阅读器，终于还是敌不过多变的市场。亚马逊溃败中国，跨境电商和Kindle是坚持运营的两大业务。数据显示，自2016年起，中国便已经成为了Kindle设备销售的全球第一大市场，关停服务无疑会影响无数用户的生活。
关切、怀念、告别，今天就用这一文章说一说，不过首先还是来一番文化批评，说说阅读这件事。
阅读的定义早已改变，功利主义让Kindle显得难能可贵
从任何一个角度来说，我都不是一个读书的人。不喜欢读书，有很多理由，从应试教育开始养成的功利主义，天然让我们抗拒读书这件事，另外便是没有时间，或者说精力，让我们在这个缺乏注意力、非常疲惫的时代，给它多分配一点。
但这说的是读书，假如说更为宽泛的阅读，其实我并不惭愧。仅在知乎一个平台，我每年的阅读量都能达到几十万字，有一年甚至相当于《四库全书》。当然，你可以说这是碎片阅读，但是它的确开始受到承认，在今年我国发布的读书日白皮书中，互联网化的阅读也算入了其中，大大拉升我国成年人的阅读数据表现。
阅读的内涵在扩大，当然你还可以说，除了知乎、公众号之外，还有各种形式的内容消费，其内在都是严密文本作为基础的，比如这两年开始的风气就是文字转视频，做公众号的都开始做视频，当然还有各类播客、有声书等等。甚至来说看电影前读的豆瓣影评都可以是一种阅读。
前些日子，奥迪抄袭一位短视频自媒体博主的文案上了热搜，从常规的语境下看，那条短视频就是分享节气的内涵解读，但是在奥迪抄袭包装以后、影帝刘德华念出来以后，大家都觉得是极其有文化的、充满文学气息的文案。
结果反转，尤其是那首所谓曾国藩的诗，从来抄袭源一错到底，让人倍感讽刺。
我们的浮躁和功利主义，它的演化路径，从一个贩售读书文化的商人创业故事就能看清楚，这个人就是梁文道。最早凤凰卫视挖掘他，每天下午给他8分钟时间做…</span>

前言
谈到 Android 架构，相信谁都能说上两句。从 MVC，MVP，MVVM，再到时下兴起 MVI，架构设计层出不穷。如何为项目选择合适架构，也成常备课题。
由于架构并非空穴来风，每一种设计都有其存在依据。唯有高频痛点熟稔于心，才能技术选型事半功倍。所以今天我们一起探寻 “架构演化” 来龙去脉，相信阅读后你会豁然开朗。

Linux 服务端，开发者通过命令行操作；Android 客户端，面向普通用户，须提供图形化操作。为此，Android 将图形系统设计为，通过客户端 Canvas 绘制图形，并交由 Surface Flinger 渲染。

前言
此工具提供用户行为（手势、文字输入）的录制及回放，同时支持记录的导出和导入。
例如，可以由测试人员进行bug复现步骤的录制及上传，并由对应开发人员下载导出再重放。当然也可以用于线上用户的反馈。
Tip:
1.此工具目前支持 flutter 2.5.3-null-safety，
-&gt;如果是其他版本的flutter可以查看Beike_AspectD是否支持，或者自行fork进行相关适配即可
2.动图可能有点儿大。
行为的录制和回放

行为记录的导出、导入及回放

实现
两种行为的录制都是基于hook实现的，
这里做一下简单介绍。
手势录制及回放
录制
手势的录制通过hook GestureBinding的-handlePointerEvent方法,对平台端所传递过来的pointer event进行转换并生成PointerEventBundle 存储在队列中。
void _hookHandlePointerEvent(PointCut pointCut) {
  gestureRecorder.handleHook(pointCut);
  pointCut.proceed();
}

class GestureRecorder extends Recorder{

  ///...其它代码

  @override
  void handleHook(PointCut pointCut) {
    if(pointCut.positionalParams.isEmpty) {
      return;

Provider Modifiers
所有的Provider都有一个内置的方法来为你的不同Provider添加额外的功能。
它们可以为 ref 对象添加新的功能，或者稍微改变Provider的consume方式。Modifiers可以在所有Provider上使用，其语法类似于命名的构造函数。
final myAutoDisposeProvider &#x3D; StateProvider.autoDispose((ref) &#x3D;&gt; 0);
final myFamilyProvider &#x3D; Provider.family((ref, id) &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;$id&#x27;);

目前，有两个Modifiers可用。
.autoDispose，这将使Provider在不再被监听时自动销毁其状态
.family，它允许使用一个外部参数创建一个Provider
一个Provider可以同时使用多个Modifiers。
final userProvider &#x3D; FutureProvider.autoDispose.family((ref, userId) async {
  return fetchUser(userId);
});

.family
.family修饰符有一个目的：根据外部参数创建一个独特的Provider。family的一些常见用例是下面这些。
将FutureProvider与.family结合起来，从其ID中获取一个Message对象
将当前的Locale传递给Provider，这样我们就可以处理国际化
family的工作方式是通过向Provider添加一个额外的参数。然后，…</span>

前言
Transform API 是 AGP1.5 就引入的特性，主要用于在 Android 构建过程中，在 Class转Dex的过程中修改 Class 字节码。利用 Transform API，我们可以拿到所有参与构建的 Class 文件，然后可以借助ASM 等字节码编辑工具进行修改，插入自定义逻辑。
国内很多团队都或多或少的用 AGP 的 Transform API 来搞点儿黑科技，比如无痕埋点，耗时统计，方法替换等。但是在AGP7.0中Transform已经被标记为废弃了，并且将在AGP8.0中移除。而AGP8.0应该会在今年内发布，可以说是已经近在眼前了。所以现在应该是时候了解一下，在Transform被废弃之后，该怎么适配了。
Transform Action介绍
Transform API是由AGP提供的，而Transform Action则是由Gradle提供。不光是 AGP 需要 Transform，Java 也需要，所以由 Gradle 来提供统一的 Transform API 也合情合理。
Transform API被废弃的原因，既然Gradle已经统一提供了API，AGP也就没必要自定义一套了。
关于 TransformAction 如何使用，Gradle 官方已经提供了很详细的文档–Transforming dependency artifacts on resolution，具体使用可以直接参考文档
AsmClassVisitorFactory介绍
直接使用Transform Action的话还是有些麻烦，跟Transform API一样，需要手动处理增量编译的逻辑。AGP很贴心的为我们又做了一层封装，提供了AsmClassVisitorFactory来方便我们使用Tran…</span>

                              <span>本篇分享一个简单轻松的内容： ThemeExtensions  和 Material3 ，它们都是 Flutter 3.0 中的重要组成部分，相信后面的小知识你可能还没了解过～。
ThemeExtensions
相信大家都用过 Flutter 里的  Theme ，在 Flutter 里可以通过修改全局的   ThemeData  就来实现一些样式上的调整，比如 ：全局去除 InkWell 和 TextButton 的点击效果。
theme: ThemeData(
   primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
   // 去掉 InkWell 的点击水波纹效果
   splashFactory: NoSplash.splashFactory,
   // 去除 InkWell 点击的 highlight
   highlightColor: Colors.transparent,
   textButtonTheme: TextButtonThemeData(
     // 去掉 TextButton 的水波纹效果
     style: ButtonStyle(splashFactory: NoSplash.splashFactory),
   ),
),

当然，开发者也可以通过  Theme.of(context) 去读取 ThemeData 的一些全局样式，从而让自己的控件配置更加灵活，但是如果  ThemeData  里没有符合你需求的参数，或者你希望这个参数只被特定控件是用，那该怎么办 ？
Flutter 3 给我们提供了一个解决方案： ThemeExtensions  。
开发者可以通过继承 ThemeExtension  并 override 对应的  copyWith 和 lerp  方法来自定义需要拓展的  ThemeData 参数，比…</span>

随着项目的运营推广，总少不了各种客户定制化的需求，当前大部分软件其实都离不开Saas的玩法；定制化需求虽然利润高(特别是海外客户)，但对于开发人员来说却比较难搞，同一套代码需要支持不同的需求。
一般我们处理这种需求的时候会引入渠道包的概念，每个客户拥有独立渠道，通过渠道指定不同的资源、赋予不同的功能，从而编译出定制化的版本。
本篇文章将分享Flutter中如何进行移动端（iOS、Android）的渠道编译，替换应用图标、名称、appkey等。
Android端
1、配置build.grade
Android端的打包配置，主要是通过build.grade文件进行配置，在android目录下加入flavorDimensions，然后配置不同的风味维度；
android {
    // ......
    flavorDimensions &#x27;channel&#x27;
    productFlavors {
        develop {
            applicationId &quot;${defaultConfig.applicationId}&quot;
        }
        customer {
            applicationId &quot;${defaultConfig.applicationId}&quot; // 可替换成客户的AppID
        }
        productFlavors.all {
            // 遍历productFlavors多渠道，设置渠道名称，在flutter层也能取到
            flavor -&gt; flavor.manifestPlaceholders.put(&quot;CHANNEL&quot;, name)

距离上一次正儿八经的技术文章已经过去了三个月，这段时间里除了上一篇文章提到的换工作以外（入职字节跳动，和下一步的计划）。经过两个多月的面试，我的 GDE (Google Developer Expert) 申请也完成了所有流程，成为了国内第 5 位 Flutter &amp; Dart 方向 GDE。
下方是收到的所有流程邮件，按倒序排列。从资质评估、两轮面试，再到协议签署的最终确认。

成为 GDE 可以获得什么？
引用 恋猫de小郭：从台下到台上，我成为 GDE（谷歌开发者专家） 的经验分享 中的总结：
GDE 是 Google 在全球范围内开展的一个开发者专家认证项目，成为 GDE 除了是对你的技术和影响力认可之外，你还可以获得：
提前获悉谷歌内部产品路线或者技术变更的相关信息；
直接和 Google 产品团队沟通技术问题，获得一些 Google 内测资格；
谷歌活动邀请，如 I/O 大会并报销差旅；
JetBrains 会为所有 GDE 提供免费的 JetBrains 全家桶；
我能成为 GDE 么？
看到上面的诸多好处，在心动的同时你可能心里也在想：
我能成为 GDE 么？
我在去年读到 Alex 分享我成为 GDE（Google 开发者专家）的经历 文章时，也是一样的状态。
心理上的设障可能是阻止我们前进的最大因素。
当我回过头看整个申请过程，可以很确定和大家说：
是的，每个人都有成为 GDE 的机会
在我看来，「GDE 是 Google 对于你在某项技术上所做出贡献的认可，更加看重你的技术影响力」。这个项目并不考察学历，公司，人人都有机会成为 GDE。
所以他难么？他没有任何门槛，只要你足够热爱某项技术并且愿意付出。
但他不难么？你可能在想技术贡献如何进行评估？下面和大家分享下我整个申请过程的准备。

                              <span>夏天，大概就是阳光、小裙子、微风和——满满一冰箱的冰饮料！
其实 4 月末的时候深圳已经差不多进入夏天了，在家晒太阳喝无糖饮料的日子已经过了一个多月，终于想写写这些幸福时光🥰
记得刚来深圳的时候，我喝奶茶还要全糖，不理解一切降低甜度的人，甜点儿不好吗？
现在……已经不怎么喝奶茶了，甜点儿的东西都觉得腻，平时最常喝东方树叶，奶茶类饮料喝就是无糖或微微甜。夏天有一阵子喜欢喝柠檬茶，点邻里的柠檬茶最是离谱，他家外卖会自己标自己的无糖柠檬茶「非常难喝」，其实我喝着还不错来着…… ┓( ´∀&#x60; )┏
总之，这篇文章就写一下，夏天喝起来清爽无负担的那些夏日冰饮~
（所以这么看来这有可能是一篇测评
注：严格意义上来讲，这里写的饮料主要指不另外加糖的。以及，由于个人不喜欢代糖的味道，不写代糖产品~
我为夏天打下的江山
茶饮料
东方树叶  4.2元/瓶
真爱！一天可以喝 1-2 瓶的那种，每次从冰箱拿出来都觉得很幸福。
一般是京东或者天猫超市买，15 瓶一箱 64 元，均价 4.2元/瓶，500ml 一瓶。
最好喝的！
最喜欢茉莉花茶的，其次是绿茶。之前出了小瓶装的雨前龙井也很好喝，不过好像是季节限定，只喝过一次后面就没见过了。
只喝过一次的季节限定
玄米茶也还行，味道……总感觉更适合秋冬。青柑普洱是个人最不喜欢的一款……
三得利乌龙茶  3.8元/瓶
乌龙茶里超多好评的一款。我不太喜欢乌龙茶，所以其实感觉一般般，不过公司饮料柜没有矿泉水的时候，也会喝这个。
看了一下京东，57 元一箱 15 瓶，均价 3.8元/瓶，500ml 一瓶，也还不错。

最近又喝到了三得利的茉莉乌龙茶，感觉比纯乌龙更好喝（可能我是茉莉真爱），均价 4.9元/瓶，贵了一点点。但是值得试试！
图就很好看
冷泡茶  ？/瓶
茶叶放矿泉水瓶里冰箱冷藏过夜。家里倒是有明后毛峰的野茶，我也只是买茶叶的时候看到据说有这种喝法，…</span>

Android 10 首次引入了全局返回手势，但直到返回触发才能看到目标上层画面。13 针对该特性进行了优化，即返回触发之前可以预览上层画面。同时彻底废弃了返回键相关的 API，这将对现有的 App 逻辑产生巨大的影响！
前言
Android 13 针对包括手机、大屏、折叠屏等 Android 设备推出了可预见型返回手势（Predictive Back Gesture）特性。该特性将便于用户在返回完成之前可以先预览到目标画面或结果，这样的话可以允许他们决定是否要继续返回或者放弃并停留在当前画面。

另外引入关于 KEYCODE_BACK KeyEvent 相关的一系列变更。
为节省篇幅和统一认识，后续的相关描述将按照如下规则简称：
本次引入的可预见型返回手势 + KEYCODE_BACK 系列变更：统称为新返回导航
KEYCODE_BACK KeyEvent：简称为 KEYCODE_BACK
传统导航模式和 Swipe-Up 导航模式下的返回按钮：简称为Back KeyButton
全局返回手势：简称为Back Gesture
Back KeyButton

适配方案的选择

SDK API 适配方案的深入探讨
新返回导航支持与否的深入比较和原理分析

背景
年初开始我们就开始了关于Gradle Sync阶段的优化。之前和大家都简单的介绍过工程相关的背景情况了，我们大概有400+的Module，然后一次的同步时间就非常的慢，我们迫切的需要对这个问题进行优化。大部分工作都是和团队内的同学一起完成的，我也只出了一点点力而已。
这次写文章真的很倒霉，之前忘了保存导致要重新开始写了。如果不是白嫖了掘金的端午礼盒，拿人手短啊，我已经打算鸽了这篇文章了。
方法论
很多人听到方法论三个字，就觉得我要开始pua，说我阿里味，但是我觉得这个查问题的方式可能会对大家有点帮助。
很多人都会有这样的困扰，给你的一个工作内容是一个你完全陌生的东西，第一选择是逃避然后开始摆烂。我记得前一阵子和一个网友聊天，他有一次面试的时候也问了这样的问题。这次同步优化其实也相似的问题,是一个对我来说相对比较陌生的东西。
我就是想说下我们是如何来拆解这个问题的。首先需要一些对应相关的基础知识，我去官网查看了些对应的文档资料，仔细的了解了Gradle生命周期相关的，看看能不能对我们后续有所帮助，这个对于后续优化其实是非常重要的。

然后我通过我们的一个monitor插件，我看了大概一个礼拜的同步相关的编译日志，发现了一蛛丝马迹的。monitor就是一个通过BuildOperationNotificationListenerRegistrar把编译信息都记录到一个本地文件夹下的html中，然后把这些信息都发布都远端，方便后续排查问题。
这个monitor插件我在github上进行了一次kotlin翻译
问题大概如下:
遍历工程文件夹速度过慢，耗时大概1分钟左右
所有依赖全部切换成源码之后因为工程太多，所以展开速度过慢
Configuration之后竟然有个很慢的东西，占据了大量的耗时
这个就是我的方法论，通常碰到一个比较大的问题，我会把…</span>

1.关于 Compoent 树
如下图场景，每个显示的物体都是 Component ，它们形成一个树形结构。代码见 【11/01】

各种角色通过 add 方法添加到树中，此时的树型结构如下：

现在有个问题：因为血条和血量是被加入到 Adventurer 构件中的，所以 Adventurer 的变换行为也会引起血条的变换。如下角色沿 Y 轴镜像，可以看到血条及文字也发生了镜像，这并不是我们所期望的。

前言
在 Flutter 中，若我们需要自定义画一张图，则需要用到 CustomPaint，不过 CustomPaint 并不是本篇文章的重点，所以我就直接贴出  CustomPaint  的相关代码，保证能够正常绘制即可。
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

  const MyHomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State createState() &#x3D;&gt; _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.white,
      child: CustomPaint(
        painter: MyPainter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyPainter extends CustomPainter {
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    canvas.drawRect(const Rect.fromLTRB(50, 50, 200, 200), Paint());
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}

Code for applications written using C usually has multiple source files, but ultimately you will need to compile them into a single executable.
You can do this in two ways: by creating a static library or a dynamic library (also called a shared library). These two types of libraries vary in terms of how they are created and linked. Your choice of which to use depends on your use case.
In a previous article, I demonstrated how to create a dynamically linked executable, which is the more commonly used method. In this article, I explain how to create a statically linked executable.

                              <span>昨晚，Kindle 中国区将在未来的一年里停止购买、未来的两年里停止下载的信息。

官方的声明
而作为一个持有多个 Kindle 的 Kindle 读者，我愿意称自己为 Kindle 难民。不过，难民归难民，在当下还是要思考接下来怎么处理。出二手我肯定是不打算，因为 Kindle 官方的新闻一出， Kindle 在二手市场的价格必然是要暴跌的（倒是可以从收藏的视角来在二手市场上收一些想要的 Kindle）。继续使用的话，就要想 Kindle 对我们的影响有多大。
先说结论：

对于喜欢线上购买图书并等 Kindle 推送的人来说，有可切换方案；
对于喜欢使用 Send To Kindle 的人来说，有可切换方案；
对于喜欢使用 Kindle 硬件来读书的人，继续使用数据线就行，不影响你的使用。
对于想要趁机切换至其他平台人来说，是个好时候，各家应该会做定向的营销。

再说细节：
1. Kindle 停止运行的重要时间节点
Kindle 对于我们的影响主要是在两个时间点：2023 年 6 月 23 日和 2024 年 6 月 40 日。

在 2023 年的 6 月 23 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 商店当中购买我们喜欢的图书（还有一年时间缓冲）。
在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 当中下载我们已经购买好的图书。
在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日之后，我们只能通过 Kindle 数据线连接电脑的方式来下载图书到 Kindle 当中阅读。

所以从短期来看，我们依然可以继续使用 Kindle 愉快的读书而没有丝毫的影响。但长期来看，如果你更喜欢线上随时选购的方案，那迁移到其他平台是必然的选择。
2. Kindle 商店停止运行后，还能做什么？
国区 Kindle 商店的停止运行，让我们失去随时购买图书的体验，如果我们想要继续可以实…</span>

1. Component 的树形结构
通过前面八篇的尝鲜，或说预热，我们可以感知到无论是主角、怪兽、文字、子弹、触点都是 Component 。它是游戏的基本构建模块，可以表示任何需要被渲染、更新的内容。

下面是 Component 类的部分结构，可以看出 Component 是一个普通类。其本身会持有父级构件，以及子级构件集合。也就是说 Component 本身是一个树形结构的节点类，认识到这一点至关重要。

正是由于树形结构的特点，C…</span>

                              <span>最近两天看完了我 2022 年第一本纸质书，麦家新作《人生海海》。今年都快过去一半了，看完了 16 本书，1 本纸质书，15 本都是在微信读书上看的电子书。但是，最爱还是纸质书。

阿根廷著名文学家博尔赫斯说过一句话，“这世界上如果有天堂，应该是图书馆的模样”，那我觉得图书馆应该是纸质书的天堂。很难想象，置身电子图书馆，周围没有一本纸质书，闭着眼睛都能感受到一种冷清的气氛。相比纸质书，我觉得它保留了读书人的气质，温文尔雅有感情的气质。
不过话说回来，纸质书与电子书的讨论一直没有停止，围绕它们俩的优缺点，能说上一大堆，我以自己一个喜欢读书的学生的视角，说说我眼中的纸质书。
纸质书的缺点
重量
我从网上查到的信息显示，一本 16 开 300 页左右的书大约在 180g~240g 之间，对比我们日常使用的手机，也在 180g~250g 之间，俗称半斤重的手机（参考 iPhone 13 Pro Max），这其实说明纸质书是比较笨重的，单本书的重量或许能接受，但遇到那种分上下册，或者需要同时带两本以上的书在身上时，就显得特别的不方便。
当然，也有的人选择在固定的场所和时间看书，比如只在自己的房间书桌上，这样即便是很重很厚的书，也没有多大的影响。
体积
我房间里有一个二合一的书桌，桌子与书柜二合一，说大不大的书柜，也装满了我从小到大看的书，要是还想继续往里面放，就有点困难了，一是占空间，二是容易积灰，遇到南方的回潮天，纸质书也容易受潮发霉，需要不定时拿出来翻动晒一晒。
价格
高三有一次看大冰的《小孩》，作者提到该书定价的事情，39.6 元，这是大冰和编辑“博弈”之后的结果，《小孩》是大冰有史以来字数最多的一本书，在如今的市场规律与成本重压之下，仍然以不高于 40 元的定价，已经很难得了。在编辑的推荐语上，也写着“他怕他的读者买不起书，怕他的读者饿着肚子花一天的饭钱买书”。 难怪被网友恶…</span>

需求
这学期，我们这儿从头到尾上网课，有些让人始料未及。
其实从 2020 年开始，上网课已经不新鲜了。但是一门课完全线上进行，甚至还包括了在线考试，这还真是第一次。
很多老师，都在担心教学效果，毕竟线上线下的环境差别很大。我一开始也不例外，着实有些焦虑。好在经过实践，发现因为有了飞书和 芦笋这样的工具，教学效果最大程度上有了保障。甚至，还收获了一些超越线下教学的益处。本文，我把自己的使用经验分享给你。主要分成以下 4 个部分：

视频会议；
通知与资料分享；
分组协作；
检索回放。

会议
首先，是飞书的视频会议功能。
我这学期开设了两门课，一门本科生，一门研究生的。我把全部的授课互动，都放在飞书会议里进行。
飞书的会议，有个非常大的好处，就是会议的组织者可以对谁该参加，谁还没加入来，可以做到一目了然。这样，压根儿就不需要点名，也用不着总去催促学委一一核对了。
上课时间到了，扫一眼，截个图，考勤结果就出来了。
我有的时候会在快要上课时，把还没进会议室的同学名字直接截屏贴一下，作为提醒。

然后嘛，就像是有魔法，他们总是很快就进来了。
在我的 M1 芯片 Mac 上面，不知道什么原因，腾讯会议不支持以 mmhmm audio 作为声音输入来源，但是飞书会议从来没有遇到问题。我在授课时候利用 mmhmm 播放视频，飞书观众的效果总是清晰流畅。
上课过程中，我会让学生在飞书群里面 call 1 作为回答的顺序。这样问答有序，计分的同学也比较容易查看到原始记录。

课程开始之前，我都会开启视频录制功能。不需要占用本地空间，所有会议内容都自动上传到服务器，并且通过飞书妙记功能，自动转换成为文字版会议纪要，还能提取关键词等。

如果有必要的话，可以把妙记文档转换成为飞书文档，共享给因为特殊事项（例如统一测核酸…</span>

2021 年度征文中我介绍了我的装修经历和复盘，装修接近尾声，设备和家具都陆续进场。这次先带大家看看，我家厨房已经添置了哪些设备和好物。
自动增压泵
品牌型号：威乐 201EH
价格：780 元 + 200 元安装费
推荐度：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
厨房好物第一站，从自动增压泵开始说起。如果你家是老小区的高楼层，我非常建议你安装自动增压泵。像我家是 1996 年的建造的房子，楼层为 6 楼。前两年在租出去时，租客就反馈水压小，特别到了冬季进水压力不足，热水器会因水压过小无法正常使用。所以我装修初期，就已经计划安装自动增压泵。

选购有自动控制器的型号
增压泵的结构氛围两个部分，下部蓝绿色卧式离心泵（增压泵本体），上部接自动控制器。一定选择有自动控制器的版本，因为泵本体是不会自动关停的，接上电源它就会一直工作。有了自动控制器才能适用到我们的日常水龙头等用水需求。当有用水信号发出后，就会触发自动控制器，启动增压泵进行工作。结合房屋面积，我选择了功率较小的 201EH，目前感觉也足够日常生活使用。
相关 tips
不过，虽然是「低噪运行」，增压泵的声音还是无法忽略的，即使增加了泡沫垫，还是能听到噪声。噪声主要来自于机身震动与厨房柜体发生的共振。这也是我家目前室内噪声的主要来源。
威乐的价格波动较大，在同事的建议下，我在闲鱼平台交易的全新设备，支持联保。威乐的安装需要另外收费，即使是天猫淘宝也是如此。
另外，在增压泵的前面，我增加了前置过滤，主要可以起到去除入户自来水中，较大的金属碎屑等颗粒物，延长各用水终端设备的使用寿命。需要特别注意，…</span>

                              <span>从 XP 时代开始，我幻想用语音转文字。后来，手机提前实现了这功能，电脑端的语音录入却一直没进展。
为了能在 PC 上用语音打字，我从 2013 折腾到 2022，经历了各种硬件和软件，终于找到最适合 PC 端的语音输入方案。
讯飞 + 小麦克风
2013 年，讯飞推出 PC 版输入法。我以为 PC 语音输入的时代已经来临，买了个十几块的小麦克风，尝试语音转文字。
可测试结果却让人大跌眼镜，语音识别准确率异常的低。即便我把麦放在嘴边，依然无法录清楚，超过 80% 内容识别错误。
过低的识别率，让我怀疑是麦克风的收音出了问题，要想语音打字就需要换个好点的话筒。但囊中羞涩，只能暂停尝试。
讯飞 + Blue Yeti
过了几年，经济宽裕点后，下单网红录音话筒 Blue Yeti，幻想着 4 位数的话筒能带来完美的收音识别效果。

但事实却是再度被打击。
对 Blue Yeti 的收音测试中，再次发现大量杂音，收货当天就直接退货。
十几元的麦克风和一千元的话筒收音效果差不多，语音输入的识别率也都超低。这让我猜测，语音输入识别率低与硬件无关，而是 PC 端的语音输入方案尚未成熟，是软件方面导致的问题。
就这样，我再次暂停了 PC 上的语音输入尝试。
外置声卡 + 动圈话筒
之后，用了 5 年的音箱出现问题，我升级了音响，并顺势添置了外置声卡，视听体验大幅提升。玩着玩着，突然想起我的语音输入梦，决定再尝试一次。
有了外置声卡，麦克风的选择多了许多，可以连接卡侬线接口的话筒了。
麦克风分为两类：电容麦、动圈麦。
电容麦收音好，但比较娇贵，怕潮怕摔，不能用桌面话筒架，适合用悬臂挂在空中，每次用完之后需要收起来。动圈麦的灵敏度和还原度都低于电容麦，存放和使用没什么要求，费用也会低些。
电容麦克风太麻烦，就选了简单的动圈麦 - 舒伯乐 PRO248S。
选好话筒后，又配了麦克风支架和卡侬线，…</span>

以下为视频版更新说明，不喜欢视频形式的朋友可以往下查看图文说明版本。
 
01 全新设计的应用主页
移动端主页面布局进行了全新的调整，增加了底部Tab，更加方便切换「卡片集」与「个人中心」。

02 支持内容挖空功能
卡片内容文字编辑工具栏支持内容挖空功能，挖空的内容在学习和查看时会自动隐藏，便于检测或记忆关键内容。

03 支持左右滑动查看卡片
查看卡片时，支持左滑右滑切换卡片，方便查看读书笔记类卡片或对于搁置学习的卡片，可以直接左滑跳过。

 
04 快速建卡功能优化
新增创建卡片快捷入口
在底部Tab新增创建卡片的快捷入口。点击“＋”按钮，在不进入卡片集的情况下，可随时创建卡片，方便“随手记”，同时支持在快速记录时，选择所属卡片集；
移动端用户在看到任何想要记录的知识点时，使用氢刻记录更加高效便捷。

连续新建
启用连续新建，每次新建之后不会关闭编辑窗口，方便连续添加多张卡片；
关闭连续新建后，每次新建后即可自动回到之前的界面，可满足不需要连续新建卡片的用户。

05 新增学习进度统计、排序等功能
主要分为以下三点：
首页卡片集列表优化
展示每个卡片集的统计信息，包括待学习卡片个数、需复习卡片个数、已学习卡片个数和卡片总数，帮助直观的了解每个卡片集的学习进度；
卡片集内部优化
展示当前卡片集学习相关统计信息，更好的了解卡片集的学习进度；

首页卡片集排序优化
增加了全新的排序功能，方便对卡片集进行管理。
目前支持6种排序方案，分别是：

按编辑时间
按创建时间
按学习时间
按卡片数量
按待学习卡片数量
按需复习卡片数量

06 新增主题卡片类型
新增主题卡片类型，每种都有各自的适用场景。主要有：

笔记卡片：适合摘录、灵感、读书笔记等；

问答卡片：适合问答类型的知识点、语言词条等；

主题卡片：适合概念介绍、名词解释等；

07 新增复习时间提示
学习功能展示数据更加细化，能直观展示已学习次数、上次学习时间、下次复习时间，帮助我们更加直观了解学习进展。

08 其他
全新的卡片编辑器：使用全新的卡片编辑器，输入和操作体验更加流畅。
全新的数据缓存机制：建立全新的数据缓存机制，卡片集数据和图片都会在本地缓存。打开应用后，卡片集列表能瞬间显示。
网页版同步更新：全新的个人中心，可在首页查看学习进展等信息。

等等等等，更多功能欢迎下载氢刻App查看。
感恩大家的支持与反馈，氢刻一直保持稳定健康的更新模式，对于大家反馈较多的功能我们会优先更新，欢迎大家提出您的宝贵建议。
预告一下：下一版更新，我们即将带来卡片集分类功能、卡片集拖动排序或置顶功能、自定义学习量等等，敬请期待。
