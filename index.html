AWS offers the broadest and deepest set of machine learning services and supporting cloud infrastructure, putting machine learning in the hands of every developer, data scientist, and expert practitioner. 


When you build an ML-based workload in AWS, you can choose from three different levels of ML services to balance speed-to-market with level of customization and ML skill level:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) services
ML services
ML frameworks and infrastructure
The AI Services level provides fully managed services that enable you to quickly add ML capabilities to your workloads using API calls. 


This gives you the ability to build powerful, intelligent applications with capabilities such as computer vision, speech, natural language, chatbots, predictions, and recommend…</span>

Please tell us about your project Fluent Search? What is it, who is it for? What can it do?
Fluent Search, as you might’ve guessed, is a search app.
By all resources, I mean everything – apps, windows, files, browser history/bookmarks, screen text, in-app content like tabs, links, and the ability to extend itself using a no-code UI platform to build extensions.
Fluent Search provides a full-screen search which gives the ability to use the computer with a keyboard only. 
I aimed for Fluent Search to provide a fluent and fast experience for its users, that&#x27;s why performance was super important. Avalonia …</span>

                    <span>Javascript works on the basis of object oriented programming. This article describes how to use objects, properties and methods, and how to create your own objects.
What is an object?
Objects and properties
objectName.propertyName
myDog
const myDog &#x3D; {
“name”: “Joe”,
“legs”: 4,
“tails”: 1,
“friends”:[“everyone”]
};


“Name”, “legs”, “tails” and “friends” are properties while “Joe” “4” “1” and “everyone” are values.
Object Methods
const person &#x3D; {
  firstName: &quot;John&quot;,
  lastName: &quot;Doe&quot;,
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + &quot; &quot; + this.lastName;
  }
};


Creating a JavaScript Object Using an Object Literal
const person &#x3D; {firstName:&quot;John&quot;, lastName:&quot;Doe&quot;, age:50, eyeColor:&quot;blue&quot;};
Conclusion
Objects in JavaScript can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a chair, for example. A chair is an object, with properties. A chair has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</span>

The syntax looks like this:
Receiver.(Parameters) → ReturnType

Developer productivity refers to the ability of developers to create high-quality software that works well and is easy to maintain in a time-effective manner. With the COVID-19 pandemic and a massive switch to home offices, businesses have been taking an increased interest in ways to increase developer productivity, including helping developers work in the flow and preventing them from burning out.
Unfortunately, instead of measuring developer productivity, many businesses have introduced micromanagement practices decreasing job performance, teamwork, innovation and increasing turnover instead. Let’s see why developer productivity is so hard to measure, which metrics are effective and why.

Para isso funcionar, o WSL precisa estar na versão 2. Você pode verificar rodando o seguinte comando no no prompt de comando do Windows:
wsl -l -v

A saída esperada é o número 2 na coluna Version:

Caso esteja versão certa, sorria e passe pra próxima fase! Caso contrário, atualize o WSL.
Para fazer a atualização do WSL 1 para o WSL 2, use o comando: wsl --set-version  2 substituindo  pela distribuição do Linux que você deseja atualizar. Use wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2 definirá sua distribuição do Ubuntu 20.04 para usar o WSL 2.

The beautiful thing about react is that it lets you break down UI into smaller components and reuse them at multiple places in your project, but that&#x27;s not it, you can standardize your components and publish them to npm or yarn and let other people use your components in their projects.
In this post, I&#x27;ll show you how you can create a component library for reactJS using Typescript, Storybook, SCSS, and Rollup. 
It&#x27;s not necessary to create a big library, you can create a library for a single component such as a Date Picker or you can create a full-fledged library like material UI.
A UI component library is very essential for organizations to maintain a consistent UI across different projects. However, you do not need to create a component library just for a single project as…</span>

                    <span>Something I enjoy - A LOT - is helping people negotiate, particularly for software engineering jobs, particularly if they are early-career or coming from a different background. To people in other fields, or new to this field, some of the stories I have from negotiating software engineering jobs sound made up. You got what!? They offer what kind of signing bonus!? They&#x27;re paying what to mid-level people!??? I personally am of the belief that the boom times will not last forever, so I try to encourage people to seize the moment of the particularly competitive job market we find ourselves in. 
Your negotiation stance is a collection of beliefs, behaviors, and boundaries that starts far before you have received a job offer. Sometimes I see new people say &quot;I&#x27;m open ended on salary for my first…</span>

Even though we don&#x27;t use Floats on our daily lives. 
This post is about the lookbook&#x27;s section of this layout.

Here, I have one section (parent-container) wrapping six boxes (child-containers).

This is my rough sketch, that can be translated to it

CSS



.lookbook  {
width:  100%;
height:  80vh;

.box  {
border:  1px  solid  red;

                    <span>As your CloudCannon sites grow progressively larger, you’ll want to configure more and more inputs. Our previous input configuration required users to redefine their input keys multiple times, spreading the configuration for an input across multiple places. This was, admittedly, a suboptimal process. But no more!
We’ve now created a consolidated key called _inputs that encompasses our previous keys:
  _options

  _comments

  _instance_values

  _select_data

  _structures (renamed from _array_structures)
For example, our previous configuration would result in the following:
    hero_image: /uploads/hero.png
    _comments:
      hero_image: Use a large image here
    _options:
      hero_image:
        width: 500
        height: 600

The new configuration looks like this:

                    <span>Fonts are popular tools on the web nowadays. Most modern websites use custom fonts, usually from Google Fonts, because it adds a custom touch to the interface and allows for more options. However, there are many performance implications with fonts on the web. Fonts are often hundreds of kilobytes and are on another domain, slowing down the website. Luckily, you can solve these problems. Here are ten tips to improve font loading performance on a website.
When you go on a website, you often see something like this:

Bookshop — our open-source page-building toolkit — now supports Hugo, as well as Jekyll and Eleventy.
If you missed our Bookshop launch post in October last year, here’s a quick recap: Bookshop empowers you to integrate components with your stack, build and browse UI components locally, and provide rich visual page-building experiences for your editors. Bookshop integrates tightly with CloudCannon for your content management needs. Editors can see the entire catalog of components available and use them to build pages visually, all powered by your custom-built component library.
Feature development has continued in the months since release, adding automatic Visual Data Bindings, Eleventy 1.0 support, and now a rich Hugo integration.

本周话题：悲观者正确，乐观者成功
最近股市下跌，美国科技股大部分都是下图的走势。

我看到一篇文章说，原因是大家悲观了。疫情第三年了，可能接近尾声了。美国后面的日子，物价上涨，利率上调，需求回归平淡，科技业的好日子就要结束了。
这不禁让我想到了，一个始终困扰我的问题：未来到底是悲观的，还是乐观的？ 今天就来谈谈这个话题，如何面对不可知的未来。

我知道很多读者，尤其是还没毕业的读者，大概会嗤之以鼻：你怎么会怀疑，未来可能是悲观的？完全杞人忧天，未来当然是乐观的！人类社会的历史，难道不是越来越进步吗！
这个我知道，而且我还可以补充：过去20年，乐观者简直是大获全胜。 只要你坚定地看好互联网和手机，你就完全看对了。要是你再坚定看好房地产，妥妥就是人生赢家，任何看空的人，恐怕都输得要哭出来。
但是，乐观的日子会继续下去吗？经济和科技会一直这样高速发展吗？
我不太敢肯定，因为有五个负面因素，正在变得越来越严重。大家不妨看看下面五点，怎样才能解决。
（1）熵的危机（气候危机）。经济发展需要消耗能源，只要能源消耗不下降，熵就会越来越多，直接导致气候灾难。
（2）技术越来越复杂，人类社会依赖技术的程度加深。迟早有一天，那些技术的复杂度，会引发难以预测和控制的连锁反应。
（3）失业增加。技术发展太快，导致很多人的劳动技能快速过时，一旦不再拥有高强度工作的体力，就会丧失就业竞争力，成为&quot;无用的人&quot;。
（4）贫富分化，财富日益集中于科技寡头，中产阶级萎缩乃…</span>

                    <span>Java语言有20多年的发展历史，拥有众多优秀的特性如面向对象、安全、解释性、平台无关等，该语言以及其强大的生态使其成为最重要的网络编程语言。但是随着近年来技术架构的发展，微服务逐渐趋向云原生及Serverless化，使得Java也面临如下挑战：启动缓慢、内存占用大、预热问题。

Java服务启动时首先要启动一个JVM虚拟机，然后虚拟机会加载字节码，中间还包括类的加载解析初始化。JVM运行字节码运行时有解释执行和编译两种执行方式：当系统刚启动时，JVM会以解释执行并检测热点代码，热点代码会通过c...</span>

문자열 s는 다음과 같은 과정을 통해 size k 길이의 문자열 그룹으로 분할 될 수 있다.
첫 그룹은 문자열 s의 시작부터 k개의 문자들, 두번째 그룹은 다음 k개의 문자들, 세번째…
각 문자는 정확히 한 그룹에만 들어갈 수 있다.
마지막 그룹은, k개보다 갯수가 모자라면, 지정된 fill 문자를 사용해 그룹을 완성하라.

분할 과정이 끝난 후에 마지막 그룹에서 fill 문자를 지우고 모든 그룹을 순서대로 연결하면 문자열 s가 ...</span>

                    <span>收听电台导致马自达车载系统损坏

1 月 30 日，西雅图的部分车型的马自达车主在收听了一个电台之后发现 车载娱乐系统损坏 了。当将广播调到一个当地的 NPR 电台 KUOW 94.9 时，来自该电台的一个信号会导致系统崩溃、屏幕冻结、车载系统陷入无限重启当中。马自达称，故障原因是电台向它的高清播放流发送了一个没有扩展名的图片，系统无法解析，这导致了价值 1500 美元的 CMU 零件损坏。而且，现在这个零件还没货。


老王点评：这真是远程广播式攻击了！




法国政府要求公司停止使用谷歌分析

一家法国公司被命令 停止使用谷歌分析，因为法国 CNIL 说美国情报部门可能会访问这些数据。它援引欧盟的 GDPR，命令至少一家法国公司停止使用这项来自谷歌的网页访问分析服务。它指出由谷歌分析收集的“互联网用户的数据被转移到美国，这违反了 GDPR”。这一新举措基于欧盟法院最近的“Schrems II”判决，其影响到任何向欧盟以外的数据转移。谷歌在支持页面也承认，在默认情况下，谷歌分析不符合 GDPR 的要求。


老王点评：这和前两天的另外一个使用 谷歌字体的案例 一样，看来欧盟之外的互联网服务要遵守 GDPR 的要求，可能需要重新设计数据的存储和使用了。




因 Alexa 排名服务即将下线，TIOBE 指数发生变化

2022 年 2 月 的 TIOBE 编程社区指数已经出来了，表面上没有什么变化，但很多编程语言的份额和上个月相比都发生超过 1% 的变化。月与月之间的差异很少超过 1%，这种 变化的主要原因 是 Alexa.com 即将下线，而 TIOBE 指数用它来选择排名最高的 25 个搜索引擎进行计算。2 月份的指数采用 Similarweb 替代了 Alexa，并同时导致了整个系统架构的变化。目前的搜索引擎名单主要包括各种本地化的谷歌产品、亚马逊、维基百科和中国门户网站 QQ，以前的来源搜狐、Ebay 等没有被考虑在 2 月份的名单中，因为它们必须首先被整合到新的程序中。


老王点评：其实编程语言是否流行，和你该不该学它、用它没什么关系，这种排行榜只适合做闲聊话题。</span>

                    <span>对于那些涉足多款浏览器的人来说，Vivaldi 5.1 版本更新极富趣味，且更加实用。




Vivaldi 对于 Linux 用户来说是个不错的选择。他们将 Linux 平台作为其官方主力维护平台之一，这一点弥足珍贵。

在 Vivaldi 5.0 版本 中，它已经成为许多 Linux 用户喜爱且极具功能性的 Chromium 内核浏览器之选。如今，Vivaldi 5.1 也终于问世！

作为一款凭借强大的多任务管理功能而著名的浏览器，这一新版本想必是干货满满。

接下来就一起深入探索吧！

Vivaldi 5.1 的新功能




还是提醒一下，Vivaldi 是一款几乎开源的浏览器，它的源代码是开放给所有用户的，但用户界面并不开源。

和之前的 5.0 版本类似，该版本带来了一些关键性的改进，包括：


可滚动的标签栏

全新的在读清单

新的开始页面快速设置面板


可滚动的标签栏




在 Vivaldi 5.1 中，你不必再沉没于狭窄而海量的标签之中。你可以直接滚动标签栏，无需缩小标签。

考虑到大多数人喜欢把标签栏放到顶部或者底部，这一新功能可以让你直接通过滚轮或者箭头键来寻找标签。

我敢相信，许多人听到这个功能能够与标签堆叠功能整合并进一步提高标签查找效率后，一定会很高兴的。是的，两级标签栏均可以使用标签滚动功能。

这一新功能使 Vivaldi 的横向标签栏与垂直标签栏有了更高的一致性，后者已经支持滚动许久。

在读列表



当阅读新闻这件事开始成为日常事务之后，设置一个在读列表会很有用。在此之前，这一功能是靠浏览器拓展实现的，而如今它已被整合到浏览器当中，大幅增强了便利性和实用性。

这一引入看上去更像是 Vivaldi 推动为其浏览器增添新服务功能的一大延续，不仅取代了一些常见拓展，更试图与 Firefox 的 Pocket 等同类平台进行竞争。

你可以直接通过键盘快捷键和鼠标手势来访问相应页面，或添加页面到在读列表中。

开始页面的快速设置



开始页面一直都是网页浏览的关键节点，用户多年来也一直在定制它。不幸的是，用户往往要深入到设置页面去寻找自己需要的选项。

如今，得益于 Vivaldi 新增的开始页面快速设置面板，这种情况将成为过去式。现在，所有与开始页面有关的选项都在同一位置，大幅改进了用户体验。

你可以通过开始页面右上角的齿轮图标查看快速设置。

其他变更

除了上述改进之外，还有许多 bug 修复，以及针对翻译、邮件、日历和订阅阅读器功能的细节改进。

你可以阅读 版本发布公告 来了解更多技术性改进。

Android 版本同样也新增了一些新功能，包括修改标签宽度和选择更多强调色。你可以在这篇 博文 中了解详情。

获取 Vivaldi 5.1

如果这些新功能很合你的胃口，你可以前往 Vivaldi 官方网站下载 Vivaldi 5.1。如果你正在使用 Debian、Ubuntu 或者 Fedora，那么很简单，直接从 Vivaldi 官网下载相应软件包就可以了。

Vivaldi 同样也提供针对 ARM 架构的 32 位及 64 位软件包。


下载 Vivaldi


对于其他发行版，很不幸，你只能等待 Vivaldi 5.1 降临到发行版的相应仓库中，毕竟它可没有 Flatpak 和 Snap 版本。

总的来说，我认为 Vivaldi 5.1 是一次巨大改进，足以让我迁移主力。

你对 Vivaldi 5.1 的更新有什么看法吗？欢迎在评论区留言，让我了解你的想法！

                    <span>你不希望别人能够监视甚至控制你的电脑，你通常会努力使用各种安全机制来切断任何此类企图。然而，有时会出现这样的情况：你迫切需要一个朋友，或一个专家来帮助你解决电脑问题，但他们并不同时在同一地点。你如何向他们展示呢？你应该拿着你的手机，拍下你的屏幕照片，然后发给他们吗？你应该录制一个视频吗？当然不是。你可以与他们分享你的屏幕，并可能让他们远程控制你的电脑一段时间。在这篇文章中，我将介绍如何在 Gnome 中允许共享电脑屏幕。

设置服务器以共享屏幕

服务器 是一台提供（服务）一些内容的计算机，其他计算机（客户端）将消费这些内容。在本文中，服务器运行的是 Fedora Workstation 和标准的 Gnome 桌面。

打开 Gnome 屏幕共享

默认情况下，Gnome 中共享计算机屏幕的功能是 关闭 的。要使用它，你需要把它打开：


启动 Gnome 控制中心Gnome Control Center。

点击 共享Sharing 标签。 

用右上角的滑块打开共享。

单击 屏幕共享Screen sharing。 

用窗口左上角的滑块打开屏幕共享。

如果你希望能够从客户端控制屏幕，请勾选 允许连接控制屏幕Allow connections to control the screen。不勾选这个按钮访问共享屏幕只允许 仅浏览view-only。

如果你想手动确认所有传入的连接，请选择 新连接必须请求访问New connections must ask for access。

如果你想允许知道密码的人连接（你不会被通知），选择 需要密码Require a password 并填写密码。密码的长度只能是 8 个字符。

勾选 显示密码Show password 以查看当前的密码是什么。为了多一点保护，不要在这里使用你的登录密码，而是选择一…</span>

                    <span>Although its popularity has been tempered by languages like Python, Lua, and Go, Perl was one of the primary utilitarian languages on Unix and Linux for 30 years. It remains an important and powerful component in many open source systems today. If you haven&#x27;t used Perl much, then you may be surprised by how helpful it can be for many tasks. This is especially true if you deal with large amounts of text in your day-to-day work.

本文短小精悍，但提及了较多若干字体和字体排印概念，可参考下图便于直观理解（非专业观点，谨供参考）：


任何创造性产出都是由一连串微小的自我错觉支撑的。换一种字体让我对写出的东西有信心。

小说、信件、收据——无论写什么文件，我都得先点击「字体」下拉菜单，斟酌取舍，然后才能动笔。这里有些很明显的选项：可靠但寡淡的 Times New Roman；清晰而简朴的 Arial；整洁又灵活的 Proxima Nova。但遇到那些排版需要精雕细琢的场合，又该用什么呢？
毫无疑问，我想说的是精致、优雅的加拉蒙（Garamond）。实际上，加拉蒙不是一种字体，而是一组字体，其来源可上溯到 16 世纪的法国，由一个叫克洛德·加拉蒙（Claude Garamond）的人创作。加拉蒙生活和工作于一个过渡时期，当时，老式的黑体字（black-letter，亦称哥特手写体、旧式英语手写体——译注）字体正在让位于更现代的罗马字体。加拉蒙的字体设计考究，类似于用笔墨手写字体，但更易于辨认；这启发了 17 世纪一位名叫让·雅农（Jean Jannon）的印刷商，制作了一种类似的字体（也以加拉蒙命名），最终引来了一场复兴。
无论加拉蒙、雅农还是其他人设计的版本，各式加拉蒙都具有一些核心特征。它们的衬线，即 i、r 等字母上额外的细微笔画，往往是倾斜或略微凹陷的。加拉蒙的「x 字高」（x-height，即 e、a 当然还有 x 等小写字母的高度）较低，而横画（crossbar，即 e 等字母中的横笔）的位置较高。加拉…</span>

[意大利] 我的天才女友 第三季

关键词：剧情

我把过去删除了，过去也把我删除了。

@潘誉晗 ：HBO 神剧《我的天才女友》第三季在万众期待下在 RaiPlay 提前开播，真是欧美圈开年一场突如其来的惊喜。这一季的内容根据「那不勒斯四部曲」第三部《离开的，留下的》改编，制作水准依然保持前两季的高质量，也获得了观众的一致好评。
在这一季内容的时间线为 1970 年，一个充满无限挑战和希望，但是又有着许多不确定性的时代。莉拉的早婚早孕并没有带给她安定平稳的生活，离婚之后的她在那不勒斯郊区的一家工厂工作，虽然看似独立，但是条件却非常辛苦。大学毕业的埃莱娜成功出版了属于自己的第一部小说，恶评好评都有，可也因此让她走进了一个自己从没有经历过的世界。
两个一起长大的姑娘似乎在这一刻面对着不同的命运，…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 1 月 25 日，Google 官方博客发表了一篇文章，主题是「为网络广告打造隐私优先的未来」。这篇文章介绍了新的广告追踪技术 FLoC，指出 FLoC 可以基本达到与传统的第三方 Cookie 广告追踪同样的广告效果，但有助于保护用户隐私。我们也在去年对这一新技术进行过讨论。
关联阅读：如果不用第三方 Cookie，Google FLoC 会是更好的替代者吗？
一年之后的 2022 年 1 月 25 日，Google 官方博客发表了另一篇文章，主题是「了解隐私沙盒的全新 Topics API」。这篇文章表示，之前的 FLoC 技术，将会被 Topics 取代。

回顾过去一年针对 FLoC 的讨论，批评的声音主要集中于以下两点：

FLoC 对于用户是一个黑盒。因为 FLoC ID 只是一个随机字符串，用户不知道它的意义是什么。但广告商可以通过 FLoC ID 和其他信息，确定用户的画像。
FLoC 的根据用户的浏览行为特征，将用户放入超过 33000 个行为组中。如果某个组内的用户数足够少，那么结合其他指纹识别技术，可以推断出用户身份，存在隐私风险。

为此，Google 推出了新的 Topics API，简化了 FLoC，一定程度上解决了大家所关注的问题。
基于 Topics API 的个性化广告
Topics API 是一种新的浏览器个性化广告解决方案，Topics 可以翻译为「主题」「感兴趣的主题」。我不知道是否应该叫它用户追踪技术，因为广告商可以直接获取用户感兴趣的主题，在不使用隐蔽跟踪技术（如浏览器指纹识别）的前提下，就能继续投放个性化广告。

Topics API 由 Google 主导设计，是 隐私沙盒 的一部分，被集成在 Chrome 浏览器内部。该技术仍处于开发的早期阶段，将会在今年开展测试。按照目前 Google 公布的信息，如果你的 …</span>

我们实践卡片笔记法已近两年时间，《How to take smart notes》 一书及中文版《卡片笔记写作法》前前后后也翻了好几遍，也与许多朋友们不断在探讨实践中的收获与困扰。近来，我们反思了自己在实践中遇到的主要困难，相应地调整了自己的笔记类型。我们的新系统更加重视项目笔记和索引笔记，探索实现「自下而上」模式和「自上而下」模式的互动和平衡。本文主要介绍我们近期对建立笔记体系的反思和调整后的基本框架。考虑到篇幅问题，本文分上下两篇，上篇介绍我们对笔记的再分类，下篇介绍笔记间的互动和笔记体系的构建。
卡片笔记实践中的三个困境
卡片笔记写作法通常以德国社会学教授 Niklas Luhmann 的笔记系统为例，强调卡片式的笔记方法，每条笔记短小而完整，笔记与笔记间充分建立链接。卡片笔记法的核心思想不是记笔记的技巧和窍门，而讲求一套完整的从笔记到写作的流程。卢曼教授将笔记分为闪念笔记（Fleeting notes）、永久笔记（Permanent notes）、文献笔记（Literature notes）、项目笔记（Project notes）和索引笔记（Index）。闪念笔记类似于我们的随手记，需要定期整理成永久笔记，整理后即可销毁。文献笔记记录文献信息和对该文献核心思想的简要总结。永久笔记是卡片笔记的核心，也是写作的基础。索引笔记为这些永久笔记提供检索途径，也有单独的卡片盒保存。项目笔记则记录与具体项目相关的笔记，项目完成后也可以销毁。
我们在实践初期尽可能安装书中介绍的方式操作，从中不断获益，但也不断遇到了一些困扰，似乎卢曼教授的…</span>

哈喽，大家好，我是爱咖啡的老林，从 2019 年 7 月 23 日成为少数派的一员至今快三年了。在少数派也写了一些关于咖啡的文章，得到了一些朋友的关注与肯定，也有朋友说学到了一些咖啡知识，这我就满足了。
2021 年对我来说是特殊的一年，这一年里只产出了 12 个咖啡相关的视频；15 篇咖啡相关的图文内容。这些内容除了在少数派平台发布，还发布在了我的微信公众号「咖啡平方」中。
B站频道：老林还年少
对于这一年的产出，我个人是很不满意的，但因为一些其他因素确实干扰了我的节奏，让我无法集中精力去产出更多的内容，这是我很遗憾的事。但新的一年已经开始，还是要抬头向前看，希望新的一年可以继续学习咖啡知识，输出更多浅显易懂的咖啡内容，继续让更多人认识咖啡，了解咖啡，爱上咖啡。
2021 年经历了很多事，这些事让我印象深刻，也深有所感，真正意义上的体会到了咖啡就是我的生活，通过咖啡让我的生活更有意思，也更有意义。
这是一篇我的 2021 年生活总结，希望读到这里的朋友能够找到咖啡在你心里的一抹悸动。

咖啡于我来说，是生活，也是兴趣所在。如果有一天没喝到一杯咖啡，那这一天味同嚼蜡，一点也不开心。喝了这么多年咖啡，总是想把好喝的咖啡分享给更多的人，但又看到很多介绍咖啡的文章和视频，不成体系，甚至还有错误，就想着能不能通过线下，与消费者面对面的聊咖啡，甚至开设一些兴趣班让更多对咖啡感兴趣，想要在家做一杯好喝的咖啡的朋友了解正确的咖啡知识，冲煮方法。
本着这个目的，开始寻…</span>

                    <span>我倒是感觉青岛的栈桥和大海还不够CP，最CP的的场景，我倒是觉着是：
青岛著名的海蚀柱地貌的石老人只有情人节前后才会和石老人在视线上相遇的太阳
尤其是只有特定时段，尤其是2月中旬情人节前后才有的这颗红心！

海蚀柱在我国沿海在全国海岸线都有广泛分布。青岛的石老人是一个高达17米的巨大海蚀柱, 其状酷似一个驼背的老人站在海中远眺, 故得名”石老人”。虽然中国有很多著名的海蚀柱，但是，日出从海蚀柱身后升起的角度，而且海蚀柱中间孔洞还能透出太阳的，只有在青岛石老人才可以见到。这里冬季观赏日出的绝佳之地！
✅选对季节：因为日出方位角（正北是0˚，正东是90˚，正南是180˚）的原因，夏季日出在夏至，东方比较靠北方的59.8˚，想要拍到日出从石老人身后升起，只有在10月中旬到3月中旬才有机会。而且海水满潮时候最佳，在太阳将要跃出海面的时刻，仿佛被大海粘住一样若即若离，远处一叶扁舟更加浪漫。如果有海鸥飞过，就更美了。
⏰在10月中旬到11月，要在秦岭路到靠近云岭路右边位置看，这个时候石老人中心的孔洞是心形❤️的。每天位置都要向石老人方向移动，11月后到12月，在云岭路到索菲亚酒店对面海滩看。最难的是冬至、元旦前后，拍摄日出的位置在一个海角的后面，必须退潮才能过去。冬至之后位置向回，也就是往左边走，2月1日之后，回到云岭路右边，❤️重新出现。




如果是其他时间段，石老人的这个孔洞是这样的：




类似的还有太阳和各种建筑的CP，也是一年一遇，小别胜新婚：







月亮遇到很难看到的南迦巴瓦月升
坐落在西藏林芝地区、海拔7782米的世界第15高峰南迦巴瓦，曾经被中国国家地理评选为“中国最美的山峰”，因常年云雾缭绕，难得一见而显得弥足珍贵。无数旅行者都曾经连续多日在观景台守候，却往往失望而归。（李翀的最高纪录是连续20次过色季拉山而不见）而虔诚的旅行者，都会因为看到南迦巴瓦而感到幸运，甚至欢呼雀跃、顶礼膜拜！
一般而言，在色加拉山垭口看到日落的概率是1/10，也就是说，去十次，能看到一次满意的日落。而月亮正好在黄金时段升起，位置合适，一年有一两次。所以说我们在色季拉山垭口看到完美的日照金山，同时又遇到位置合适的月升，真的很难得。三脚架支撑着三台相机拍摄，我则是跪在地上流着激动的眼泪在拍摄。
这次南迦巴瓦峰的月升的拍摄点，是距离南迦巴瓦峰39公里，高度差3000米的地方，一次性拍摄的，不是二次曝光，不是Photoshop合成：
拍摄设备：EOS 5D Mark IV+EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM @380mm
手持，1/1000秒，f/8，ISO 800



月亮和建筑物的重合，也算是一种一年只有几次的CP

                    <span>谢邀。
私以为：“豪华感”其实是一种“隔绝感”，把你和整个外界环境做出“适当”的隔绝，让你能感受到很自我的舒适和自在。


1、从感官上一条一条说：
视觉上：
按照传统定义的汽车内饰豪华：木纹和真皮的使用，造型的环抱感，电动遮阳帘，都是在模仿室内环境（当然可以理解是传统的西方室内环境），让人觉得进入车里就是私人的小空间。

触觉上：
舒服的座椅、细腻的纹理，特别决定内饰的豪华感。

传统豪华品牌奔驰深谙此道，比如W221的奔驰S65 AMG在转弯时主动充气拖住的腰托，比如S级后排和被戏称为“D罩杯”的舒适头枕，比如内饰旋钮按键的阻尼感和亲肤感，都是在提供适度的“隔绝”与“缓冲“。
再比如魔毯主动悬架技术、悬架里轴向和径向刚度不同的橡胶衬垫、匹配更舒适而静音的轮胎——是在行驶途中，隔绝环境造成的颠簸，给你一个自在的“小环境”。

听觉上：
听觉上也是如此，噪音控制是豪华车型重要的一环，汽车厂商也是在此各种花心思，比如大面积的吸音材料、双层玻璃、主动降噪音响、发动机静音技术、静音轮胎——甚至是取消掉噪音最大的来源发动机：纯电车在静谧性方面也有得天独厚的先天优势。


2、
平顺性、静谧性、豪华感，都提到了轮胎——作为车辆唯一和路面接触的部件，轮胎的重要经常被车主低估。
轮胎有多重要呢，在赛道里轮胎对圈速的影响简直可以说是决定性的。
在锐思的1min前后的小赛道，bmw M2C换了套轮胎就能进步1s+。同样在这条小赛道，前两天鲁超教主测吉利星越L 1:02.61的圈速成绩，完虐了原厂宝马325（1:03.28）。我去吃瓜问“你这是不是被充值了”，他说圈速成绩绝对真实，只是吉利的胎比325用的轮胎级别高出好几级。在赛道里轮胎的差别比车本身的差别还要大，不同轮胎甚至可以理解为大家进行的不是同一个项目的比试了。
所以，有改装想法、且不满足于“气氛组”和“唇上马力”改装的，不妨先从轮胎开…</span>

                    <span>最近收到了不少邀请，所以趁假期简单写一下吧，如果有错误或者遗漏欢迎指出。本文有很多音视频内容，如果能一边看一边听会更容易理解这个问题。
先上结论：如果我们从时间脉络上来看的话，“古典音乐”的内涵其实一直在扩大，广义上的古典音乐，直到今天还是有很多人去创作的。但是如果指的是“狭义的古典音乐”，那么确实是已经死了。但是音乐的发展不是一个一蹴而就的过程，一种风格的诞生与式微也必然需要漫长的时间，所以本文将主要按照时间顺序（曲目大致按照作曲家的生卒年排序）来梳理“古典音乐”的发展过程，并且说一说为什么古典音乐虽然死了，但是又没死（bushi）。
一、早期音乐（Early Music）
早期音乐，主要指的是中世纪到文艺复兴时期的音乐，当然也有文献将巴洛克时期的音乐也归到早期音乐的范畴里。这一时期的音乐，通常不被认为属于“古典音乐”的范畴，但是可以认为是西方音乐的初始的形态。更早期的就不说了，说一下这一时期比较有代表性的几种音乐类型：格里高利圣咏（Gregorian chant）和奥尔加农（Organum）。
1. 格里高利圣咏
格里高利圣咏是一种由人声演唱的，单声部无伴奏的教会音乐，记谱法与现代的五线谱也有一些差别，用的是纽姆记谱法（Neuma）。这种音乐虽然很原始，但是后续的多声部音乐以及复调音乐却是在这种音乐形态上发展起来的。
格里高利圣咏 - Deum Verum
2. 奥尔加农
奥尔加农则是在格里高利圣咏的基础上又增加了更多的声部，属于最早的多声部音乐。最初的奥尔加农是在格里高利圣咏的声部下方增加一个平行五度或是四度的固定音程声部，又称为“平行奥尔加农”，第二个声部并不具有独立性。不过随着时间的发展，作曲家也开始创作除了平行之外的有更多音程变化的第二声部，复调音乐也就此产生了。
奥尔加农

                    <span>单纯品牌力的话，BBA中如果非要挑出一个“落伍”的，那就是奥迪。
道理很简单，芯片短缺期间BBA三家先后涨价并限制资源，BB终端受到的影响并不大，但奥迪没坚持多久就开始放价了。虽然平时我们都认为BBA依然是同一线豪华品牌，并且奥迪部分车型更具技术和性价比，但很明显消费市场用实际情况告诉大家：如果都按指导价销售的话，原本想买奥迪的都去奔驰宝马了。
回归正题，2021年影响奔驰C销售情况的主要因素就两个：

资源短缺，当时新款预计9月上市的时候，老款6-7月份在很多店就已经断货了，新款上市后货量一直供应不足，直至2021年底车源情况才有所缓解；
新款内外观变化较大，因为视觉差异明显且新C被媒体取了个“小S”的称呼，时间搁置越久，老款越不好卖，所以必须压制新款的吸引力而优先出清老款；


资源短缺这个困难各个车企都存在，但也在细节上各不相同。单拿BBA来说的话，奔驰的资源告急时间节点是晚于宝马和奥迪的，但进入资源短缺状态之后，奔驰格外缺车，不像宝马那样虽然不够卖但陆陆续续也能到一些车。
所以如果在那个时间段去逛一逛，会发现展厅最空的是奔驰，其次是宝马，而奥迪销售可能还会告诉你芯片短缺没什么大不了的过段时间就有车到了。

上个月，也就是2022年1月份的时候，一些奔驰4S店还有少量老款奔驰C的库存（车型代码801），普遍优惠幅度在45000，这个价格就是普通人不找关系不走野路子在4S店多谈谈就能拿到的价格，而新款奔驰C（车型代码802）的优惠幅度只有12000-15000，不仅如此，因为新款配置有所增加和改变，所以指导价也是上调了的。
这就回到了回答前两段碰瓷奥迪的问题——对于很多人来说，奥迪不是不好，而是超出了他们认可的定价区间，而奔驰也是故意拉大新老款的优惠幅度，使两代同款车型的落地价差距几乎能达到C级和A4L的差距，这样一来，自然是老款更好卖一些，但整体销量必然受损，道理很简单：不是所有人在感觉新款超预算的时候还会乐意去买老款，没准就出门左转去宝马看3系了。
春节前我的老同学突然想给自己老婆换台车，问我C级和3系怎么选，我说你爱咋选咋选这个不要问我，看中哪款车我帮你去找关系要价就好了。结果这家伙奔着C级去却差点就买了CLA，眼看形势都有点控制不住了我就以他还没看宝马为由拉走了，到了宝马也略有离谱，看了两眼3系就站在5系旁边挪不动步了，随后惦记了好几天，想买5系，嘴上说还是给老婆买，其实内心已经是自己想开了。
不过最终他结合家人意见和自己的喜好选了奔驰E，了解车源和行情的时候遇到了跟之前看C级一样的情况：4S店有现车，但交车欲望并不强烈。
春节前常规进店客户，几乎就是统一口径没现车，需要订单排产，大概率节后提车。只有遇到极为难缠且利润大的客户单子，才会考虑放现车，除此以外，就是我们这种靠关系渠道而来的，不情不愿地给匀一台现车出来，这就是奔驰在春节前资源刚刚缓解时期的销售现状，卖车真不着急，利润优先。

综合来看，不仅限于奔驰，在2021年很多品牌在车源紧张时期突然就尝到了之前梦寐以求的甜头：翻倍的利润，翻好几倍的利润。
价格涨了之后，稀少的车源依然无法满足打了折扣的市场需求，所以在2021年也是少见的厂商双方都在内心窃喜的一年，以前经销商想保利润，厂家要求上量，而彼时却没有了这一层烦恼。
所以即使要评估BBA中谁落伍，也不应该拿2021年尤其下半年的数据来分析，你永远不知道到底哪一家表面数据难看私底下却乐开了花。

https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/releases
Over the past 8 months, we have been working together with the community (in public), and third party Security Auditors and Pentesters Radically Open Security (in private) to apply needed finish to Tauri Core. This includes not only usability features and fixing incomplete APIs, but also enhancing the overall security of the ecosystem and producing a number of official Tauri plugins.
Our current top priority for 1.0 is delivering a smooth process for not only setting up Tauri requirements on all development platforms, but also the creation of new Tauri projects. To acheive this we need to test it on as many platforms as possible, squash any bugs during a few RC versions, and enhance all of the documentation.

                    <span>Definindo as cores


No CSS as cores podem ser definidas por Nome, Código hexadecimal e/ou Código RGB.
Exemplo:

OBS: códigos hexadecimais sempre devem ser iniciados por &quot;#&quot;.
A partir daqui, vamos usar de exemplo um simples botão que já tem suas cores pré-definidas pelo próprio navegador.
 
E para colorir esse botão, passaremos pelas seguintes propriedades de CSS...
Com a propriedade &quot;background-color&quot; podemos mudar as cores de fundo dos elementos HTML.
 
Já a propriedade &quot;color&quot; nos permite alterar as cores dos textos nos elementos HTML.

Também podemos mudar as cores das bordas dos elementos usando a propriedade &quot;border-color&quot;, mas atenção, para você conseguir ver essa cor refletir, o elemento precisa ter a largura da borda e o tipo já definidos por você ou pelo navegador.
 
Falando ainda sobre a borda, também podemos unir todas as propriedades de bordas, que mencionei, em uma única propriedade. A abreviação será &quot;border&quot;.
 
A propriedade &quot;outline-color&quot; é muito parecida com a propriedade de borda, porém, o outline serve para marcar/contornar o elemento que está em foco na página caso o usuário queira passar pelos itens usando o teclado e não o mouse.
Assim como a borda, o outline-color também precisa da definição da largura e do tipo do contorno para assim refletir a cor. A sua abreviação é &quot;outline&quot;.
 
Normalmente as cores de outline ficam ocultas no código e apenas são visíveis quando o elemento de fato estiver em foco na página, de acordo com a navegação do usuário.
 
A propriedade &quot;outline-offset&quot; adiciona um espaço transparente entre o contorno e a borda do elemento.

Código do botão:

                    <span>Everyone knows about Wordle the game where you have to guess a 5 letter word and you only have 6 attempts.
So I thought that will be a good idea to make a version where you can play against another player to see who can guess the word first.
I called it WarWordly and it was product of the day in Product Hunt
The rules of the game are simple enough, you start with a valid word and each letter receives a color acording to this rules:
⬜️ Gray: the letter is incorrect
🟧 Orange: the letter is correct but in the wrong position
🟩 Green: the letter is correct and is in the correct position

The idea for this game is that we can compete with another player, and for that we have to see how our opponent is doing, like this:

So on the left is our guesses and on the right is our opponent.

                    <span>So, you’ve decided to create a mobile app. There is one critical decision that you need to make right away that will determine the project’s long-term viability: whether it will be designed as a “native” or web-based” app. 
A native app is one designed for a specific platform, such as iPhone or Android, and uses the platform’s code libraries and hardware features (camera, GPS, etc.). On the other hand, a web-based app is hosted on the internet and can be accessed through the mobile device’s browser. 
Let’s look at the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches while taking into consideration the possibilities of doing both (native AND web-based) due to the advancement of web-based apps.

                    <span>Maybe this is a common experience in web dev bootcamps.
I&#x27;ve been using triple equality in my code ever since. It can be a beautiful thing to behold. So demanding. So pushy. Just look at it.
console.log(12+14&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;37-11) ** &gt;&gt; true **
I will admit at the same time that this feels intellectually lazy. And when things feel intellectually lazy, it&#x27;s usually an omen that relevant bugs will turn their ugly head when you&#x27;re least expecting.
The distinction that I always hear between abstract (aka &quot;double&quot;) and strict (aka &quot;triple&quot;) equality in JS is that triple equality checks the data type while double equality does not, thus making triple equality more useful. 
below is how each comparison process takes place according to the JS spec.

                    <span>Note: This is the third part of the 5 part series dedicated to the pseudo classes of CSS.
In this part, we&#x27;ll understand the the pseudo class :visited but if you want to jump to any other pseudo class, be my guest and click on the links provided below:
part 1: pesudo class :hover
part 2: pseudo class :link
part 3: pseudo class :visited - yet to be written
part 4: pseudo class: active - yet to be written
part 5: LVHA order - yet to be written.
Use the :visited selector to style links to visited pages.
If you have read about the :link selector above, understand that the :visited is exactly opposite of it. let me tell you how.

We saw in the :link selector that initially the text&#x27;s color is defined in the :link selector and the color changes to default only after it is clicked.
 
However, in :visited the text will initially have the default color and only when we click on it, the color will change to the one defined in the :visited selector.
The :visited selector is used to style links to visited pages as compared to the :link selector which is used to style links to unvisited pages.

                    <span>I often run shell commands from python with Popen, but not often enough do I set up error handline for these subprocesses.  It&#x27;s not too hard, but it can be a bit awkward if you don&#x27;t do it enough.
import subprocess from subprocess import Popen

# this will run the shell command &#x60;cat me&#x60; and capture stdout and stderr
proc &#x3D; Popen([&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;me&quot;], stdout&#x3D;subprocess.PIPE, stderr&#x3D;subprocess.PIPE)

# this will wait for the process to finish.
proc.wait()

To get the stderr we must get it from the proc, read it, and decode the bystring.  Note that we can only get the stderr object once, so if you want to do more than just read it you will need to store a copy of it.
proc.stderr.read().decode()

Now that we can read the stderr we can make better error tracking for the user so they can see what to do to resolve the issue rather than blindly failing.
err_message &#x3D; proc.stderr.read().decode() if proc.returncode !&#x3D; 0:
    # the process was not successful

                    <span>去年全球最大盗版网站访问量来源为美国

Akamai 最新的《互联网安全状况》研究报告显示，盗版网站的访问量在 2021 年 1 月至 9 月期间总计达 1320 亿次；其中 61.5% 会直接通过访问盗版资源网站来获取资源，而 28.6% 的人群则为主动搜寻盗版内容。全球前 5 大盗版网站访问量来源分别为美国（135 亿）、俄国（72 亿）、印度（65 亿）、中国（59 亿）和巴西（45 亿） 。


老王点评：美国总是指责中国的知识产权问题，不如先查查自己。




苹果正在开发新操作系统 realityOS

苹果正在开发一个 混合现实平台，已经开发了数年，团队成员多达数千人。苹果混合现实平台经历了多次延期，据报道曾计划在 2019 年发布混合现实设备，目前还不知道苹果何时发布运行 realityOS 的设备，也许是今年，也许是明年。


老王点评：说实话，现在的 VR/AR 设备还比较原始，或许苹果准备推出一个完全不同的产品来，才不断延期。




英特尔发现 16 个 BIOS 新漏洞

英特尔发布了一份 新的安全公告，其中包含了 16 个与 BIOS 相关的新漏洞。攻击者可以利用这些漏洞，在本地主机上使用拒绝服务和特权升级进行攻击，而且可以绕过操作系统和其相关的安全措施。其中有 10 个漏洞的严重程度被评为“高”，这意味着允许不受限制地访问。不过这些漏洞只能在本地有物理访问权的情况下才能被利用，不能用于远程攻击。


老王点评：由于大部分情况下 BIOS 漏洞不能远程利用，所以很多人对 BIOS 漏洞是不在意的。</span>

                    <span>KDE Plasma 5.24 带来了更新的 Breeze 主题、新的概览效果、新的墙纸，以及进一步的改进。




我们已经关注 KDE Plasma 5.24 有一段时间了。

从发现 GNOME 风格的概览效果 到增加 指纹支持。如果你一直在关注我们的报道，你已经知道了 KDE Plasma 5.24 所带来的变化。

现在，KDE Plasma 5.24 稳定版终于来了，让我重点介绍一下主要新增内容和改进。

KDE Plasma 5.24 的新变化



KDE Plasma 5.24 是一个长期支持版本，它会不断得到更新，直到 Plasma 5 发布最终版本（并过渡到 Plasma 6）。

在这个版本中，你不会看到大幅度的视觉变化，但你可以找到各种功能改进和细微的视觉完善。

对 Breeze 主题的更新



Breeze 主题得到了一些视觉上的调整，以提高与应用程序的 Breeze 风格的视觉一致性。

除此之外，默认的 Breeze 配色方案被重新命名为 “Breeze Classic”，以将其与 “Breeze Light” 和 “Breeze Dark” 颜色主题分开。

选择重点颜色的能力最初是在 KDE Plasma 5.23 中引入的，但现在你也可以为其选择一个自定义的颜色。

对通知的改进



为了从视觉上区分重要的通知，你会注意到它的边上有一个橙色的条纹，以帮助它们从不太紧急的消息中脱颖而出。

此外，为了提高用户体验，如果通知是关于视频/图片的，通知会显示一个内容的缩略图，以给你一个视觉提示。

概览效果



在 KDE Plasma 5.24 中，你终于可以看到新的“概览Overview”效果了。请注意，这个功能还在测试阶段。

它可以让你轻松地浏览多个桌面，而默认是禁用的。你必须前往“系统设置System settings→工作区行为Workspace Behavior→桌面效果Desktop Effects”，在“窗口管理Window Management”选项下启用它并测试它。



你可以按住 Windows/Super 键，然后按 W 键，查看所有活动窗口和虚拟桌面的概况。

对“发现”的改进



KDE 的软件中心，即“发现Discover”也得到了一些升级，包括防止用户删除重要软件包的能力。它还允许你在更新后自动重新启动。因此，你不必等待更新完成，然后再重新启动你的系统。



除此之外，你现在可以打开本地下载的 Flatpak 软件包，并通过“发现”进行安装（软件库也应会自动添加）。

锁屏/登录中的指纹识别支持

在 Plasma 5.24 中，加入了指纹认证支持。你最多可以添加 10 个指纹，用它们来解锁屏幕或验证一个应用程序内的操作。

其他改进

Plasma 5.24 还有其他一些变化。你可以通过 变更日志 了解所有技术细节。

一些亮点包括：


对屏幕键盘的改进

&amp;ldquolasma Pass” 密码管理器采用了现代化的设计

在没有电池的电脑上，“电池和亮度”现在变成了只有亮度控制。

对 Krunner 的改进

当你拖放小部件时，它们现在可以平滑地以动画方式移动到最终位置，而不是立即传送到那里。

在“关于这个系统About this System”的页面上有一个新的按钮，可以让你快速访问信息中心。

即使屏幕被关闭或拔掉电源，活动窗口也会留在各自的桌面屏幕上。


截至目前，你可以使用 KDE Neon 尝试 KDE Plasma 5.24，它专注于提供最新、最棒的 KDE 软件包。但请注意，它可能不是其他流行的 Linux 发行版的完整桌面替代品。

如果你想在你目前的发行版上使用最新的 KDE Plasma，你得等待它进入默认仓库。

你对 KDE Plasma 5.24 有什么看法？你试过了吗？让我在下面的评论中知道你的想法。

                    <span>Logseq 是一个多功能的知识平台，支持 Markdown 和 Org 模式。你可以创建任务、管理笔记，并利用它们做更多的事情。


在信息时代，适当地组织你的思想、任务清单和任何其他与你的工作/个人生活有关的笔记是至关重要的。

虽然我们中的一些人选择使用单独的应用程序和服务，但使用一个一体化的、开源的、对隐私友好的应用程序来做这一切不是更好？

这就是 Logseq 出现的地方。



Logseq：支持 Markdown &amp; Org 模式的隐私友好知识平台

Logseq 旨在帮助你组织、创建待办事项清单，并建立一个知识图谱。

你可以使用现有的 Markdown 或 Org 模式文件来简单地编辑、编写和保存任何新的笔记。

官方称，Logseq 仍处于测试阶段，但自从进入 alpha 阶段以来，它就得到了广泛赞誉。

它也可以成为 黑曜石 的一个不错的开源替代品。默认情况下，它依赖于你的本地目录，但你可以选择任何云目录来通过你的文件系统进行同步。所以，你的数据在你控制之中。

如果你没有设置任何云存储，你可以尝试使用 Rclone、Insync，甚至是 rsync 命令。



Logseq 具备强大的能力，也支持插件来进一步扩展功能。让我强调一些关键的功能来帮助你决定。

Logseq 的功能



Logseq 提供了一个知识应用平台的所有基本要素。以下是你可以从它那里得到的东西：


Markdown 编辑器

支持 Org 模式文件

反向链接

页面和块引用（链接它们）

页面和块嵌入，以添加引文/参考文献

支持添加任务和待办事项清单

能够按优先级或按字母顺序添加任务

发布页面并使用本地主机或 GitHub 页面访问它

支持高级命令

能够从你现有的资源中创建一个模板来重新使用它

页面别名

PDF 高亮

创建卡片并快速回顾以记住东西

Excalidraw 集成

Zotero 集成

通过简单地创建一个 custom.css 文件添加一个自定义主题，也有可用的社区制作的文件供快速使用

自定义键盘快捷方式

自我托管 Logseq 的能力

跨平台支持


尽管这是一个测试版软件，但在我简短的测试中，它可以如预期的工作。我不是一个资深用户，没有检查它令人印象深刻的知识图谱功能，但如果你有许多 Markdown 笔记，你可以添加它们、链接它们，并看看生成的图谱。

我能够添加任务、链接页面、添加引用、嵌入页面，查看现有数据的知识图谱。

你可以随时从插件市场上改变主题，并使用插件增加功能，这应该有助于你为你的工作流程提供个性化的体验。



我发现它非常容易使用，而且如果你在某个地方卡住了，文档 很好地解释了一切。

在 Linux 中安装 Logseq

你可以在它的 GitHub 发布区 中找到预发布和测试版本的 AppImage 文件。此外，你也应该在 Flathub 上找到它的列表。因此，你可以在你选择的任何 Linux 发行版上安装它。

如果你需要帮助，你可能想参考我们的 AppImage 和 Flatpak 指南来开始。

无论哪种情况，你都可以前往它的 官方网页 了解更多信息。

                    <span>Released in early 1988, Perl is a postmodern programming language often considered a scripting language, but it is also capable of object-oriented programming. It is a mature language with tens of thousands of libraries, GUI frameworks, a spin-off language called Raku, and an active and passionate community. Its developers pride themselves on its flexibility: According to its creator Larry Wall, Perl doesn&#x27;t enforce any particular programming style on its users, and there&#x27;s more than one way to accomplish most things.

随着 Flutter 的发展，这些年  Flutter 上的状态管理框架如“雨后春笋”般层出不穷，而近一年以来最受官方推荐的状态管理框架无疑就是 Riverpod ，甚至已经超过了 Provider ，事实上 Riverpod 官方也称自己为 “Provider，但与众不同”。
Provider 本身用它自己的话来说是 “InheritedWidget 的封装，但更简单且复用能力更强。” ，而 Riverpod 就是在 Provider 的基础上重构了新的可能。
关于过去一年状态管理框架的对比可以看 《2021 年的 Flutter 状态管理：如何选择？》 ， 本文主要是带你解剖 RiverPod 的内部是如何实现，理解它的工作原理，以及如何做到比 Provider 更少的模板和不依赖 BuildContext 。
前言
如果说 Riverpod  最明显的特点是什么，那就是外部不依赖  BuildContext (其实就是换了另外一种依赖形态)，因为不依赖 BuildContext ，所以它可以比较简单做到类似如下的效果：

也就是 Riverpod 中的 Provider 可以随意写成全局，并且不依赖 BuildContext 来编写我们需要的业务逻辑。
⚠️ 提前声明下，这里和后续的 Provider ，和第三方库 provider 没有关系。
那  Riverpod 具体内部是怎么实现的呢？接下来让我们开始探索 Riverpod 的实现原理。
Riverpod 的实现相对还是比较复杂，所以还耐心往下看，因为本篇是逐步解析，所以如果看的过程有些迷惑可以先不必在意，通篇看完再回过来翻阅可能就会更加明朗。
从 ProviderScope 开始

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战。
昨天在康 KunMinX 大佬的：《重学安卓：Activity 生命周期的 3 个辟谣》，在加餐处看到这段：

转换后的理解：单进程场景，Activity被回收只可能是因为进程被系统回收了。
感觉不太对？因为在很久以前，遇到过这样一个场景：
App打开多个Activity，然后手机晾一边，过一段时间后(屏幕常亮)，点击回退，之前的Activity空白，然后重新加载了。

App在前台，不在栈顶的Activity却被干掉，但进程还健在，如果真是这样，就和上面的理解有些出入了。
立马写个代码验证下，大概流程如下：
写个父类Activity，生命周期回调加日志打印，接着打开一个Activity，包含一个按钮，点击后依次打开多个Activity，最后一个加个按钮，点一下就申请一个大一点的ByteArray来模拟内存分配，看内存不足时是否会回收Activity。
测试结果如下：

App宁愿OOM，也不愿意回收Activity，鬼使神差地加上 android:largeHeap&#x3D;&quot;true&quot; ，结果一样。
em...难道是我记错了？？？
等等！！！我好像混淆了两个东西：系统可用内存不足 和 应用可用内存不足。
0x1、系统可用内存不足
LMK机制
Android系统中，进程的生命周期由系统控制，处于体验和性能考虑，在APP中点击Home键或Back回退操作，并不会真的杀掉APP，进程依旧存在于内存中，这样下次启动此APP时就能更加快速。随着系统运行时间增长，打开APP越来越多，内存中的进程随着增多，系统的可用内存会越来越少。咋办，总不能让用户自己去杀进程吧，所以系统内置一套 回收机制，当系统可用内存达到一个 阈值，系统会根据…</span>

                    <span>但凡能摆个桌子有点地方，大家都有把东西收拾收拾弄个漂亮桌面的想法，不为别的就是图个高兴。但理想总是很丰满， 现实一直很骨感，大部分人对于怎么收拾桌子根本就无从下手。2021年笔者正式开启了工作室计划，其中对桌面功能化搭配的多次迭代占据了最重要的位置。正好根据自己的桌面布置经验，复盘下2021年搭配的这几个桌面，希望能给大家起到参考作用。文中的图片拍摄时间大都不相同，而且某些图片可能会有重复使用的情况还请谅解。

1.两组桌面的迭代
工作室计划的第一次桌搭，完全是在逐渐摸索这次小桌面的改造，拍摄时间不同，一部分设备和配件是逐渐完成搭配的。也是从这次开始建立了分区规划的设计思路，更早地进行整体设计，完成对分区布局进行规划，再来下手选件装配的效率会更高。

大桌面是当时跟项目时候入手的，最后回京让项目部同时拆了直接寄回来了。大件一定不要选德邦，除了个别螺丝的丢失外，桌腿配件还差点丢了，到手还有变形。这次也开启了年内一直是上床下桌的环境条件限制。初步改造仅仅是将小桌面的设备挪到了这个大桌面上，没有多久就开始了二次、三次改造。

小桌面的第二次改造间隔就远了许多，是为了契合平时修图、做视频这些工作服务。

桌面东西不算太多，整体拓扑如下。

紧接小桌面二次改造之后进行了直播化改造，这次桌面只用于看电影、打游戏和直播。对于主机游戏而言，显示设备优先要保证的必然是是4K分辨率和HDR支持，游戏画面通路的输出、分线、采集和显示设备不能有短版。直播和拍摄需要保证拍摄画面范围所及之处，也不能一堆东西塞得哪哪都是。那么自然桌面要足够大足够干净。

桌面结构不多说，基本系统划分为了六大块，整体拓扑如下。

当然，想要直播怎么也得露脸或者套个皮吧，继续安排要安排上摄像头和绿幕。

这也算是完成了完全版的直播系统，整体拓扑如下。

这也是2021年的最后一次改造，把东西收拾收拾弄个漂漂亮亮，可以说是比…</span>

写在前面的话
前几年刚成为父母的时候在这儿发表过一篇总结，提到了平衡家庭和如何成为合格的父母这个话题（2020 年，按下暂停键后的思考）。几年过去了，孩子渐渐长大，催二胎的声音同样有增无减。正好趁着征文活动的额外动力再次总结，谈谈我对生孩子这件事情的看法。我明白这个话题是很有争议的，也无数次的考虑换个话题或者干脆放弃。然而这就是我近些年花大量时间思考和犹豫的内容，孩子的问题对我来说就如同是「房间里的大象」，很难视而不见。所以最终还是决定动笔，并改了不知道多少遍。
生命的神奇之处在于内在的生命力。所有可以被称作为生命的东西，都能够用各种方式一代一代的繁衍和产生后代，并通过进化或智慧与环境共存，来实现尽可能久的存在这个终极目标。我们人类也不例外。几年前我有了一个女儿。从那之后起，生活有了很多改变，催生二胎的声音也就此开始一直没有停止过，甚至比婚后催生更强烈。
我并不想生，这个决定让很多人不理解。
成为父亲的幸福和美好
首先需要澄清的是，拥有孩子并且养育她的过程会带来很多的幸福感。当然幸福不是简单的加减，很难得出结论说总体而言如何。所以仅聚焦在正面的获得。例如从非常基础的层面来说，生儿育女会让人有一种「完整感」。说不出是因为基因得到了传承，还是实现了社会和家庭的要求，看着自己的下一代会有一种生命延续的恍惚感。
作为家庭中的依赖者，突然变成了被依赖者，这是一种很难用语言形容的感觉。从一张白纸开始养一个小孩，她真的会极端信任你，从心底深处相信你说的每一个字。这份…</span>

人体工学椅起源
人体工学椅算是办公椅的一个改进，而且是应对996的改进。不适合的床会越躺越腰酸背痛，不适合的椅子也是越坐越难受。为了人更能卷，办公椅就演化出了人体工学椅，迎合长时间坐的需求。

本科专业是建筑学，在室内设计课程上对办公椅的模数和设计史都略有了解。最初的人体工学椅就是建筑师设计的，赖特在设计肥皂公司Larkin的办公大楼时，还设计了人体工学椅作为搭配。创新之处是具备高度调节，外观上还夹杂了不少赖特的个人设计风格。

真正意义的人体工学椅是上世纪70年代米国总统尼克松签署《职业安全与管理法》之后出现的，当时刚好新材料普及和人体工程学兴起，出现Humanscale、Herman Miller等人体工学椅品牌。

比较有名是Niels Diffrient为Humanscale设计的产品，基本是现在人体工学椅的雏形。
 
怎么选人体工学椅？
前些日子有流行汽车座椅改办公椅的，感觉算是一种误区吧。虽然两种椅子都着重于坐得舒适，但是汽车座椅有对于挡风玻璃视野、脚踏和安全性的考虑。

办公椅人体工学的基本点就是肩膀放松，后背和手臂有支撑，大腿水平，脚能平放。汽车座椅和办公椅两者有着不同的人体工程学研究，强行将汽车座椅改成办公椅，有点得不偿失。

为了实现肩膀放松，后背和手臂有支撑，大腿水平，脚能平放，椅子的基本组成是关键。一般人体工学椅，基本的组成如图所示。从底往上依次是椅轮、五星脚、气压棒、底盘、坐垫、扶手、椅背、头枕。个人刚入手有谱FlyMax升级版电竞款，可以作为参考。

@Tp：多合一读卡器

入手渠道：淘宝自购
入手价格：¥58

自从年初购入相机后，照片的传输就成了一个大问题。我本来不想专门买个读卡器来传输照片，因为单个读卡器很难满足我同时连接电脑、iPad 和 iPhone 的需求。奈何富士的照片传输 App 不够好用，连接、传输速度都很难让人满意。终于有一天，我在淘宝上看到了这个多合一读卡器，正好可以满足多设备连接的需求。
这个读卡器有 USB A、USB C 和 Lightning 三个插口，同时支持读取 SD 卡和 microSD 卡。店家提供了 USB 2.0 和 3.0 两种款式，因为我几乎没有使用 USB A 的场景，所以果断买了更便宜的 2.0 版本。

在实际体验中，照片传输速度还是令人满意的，至少比 App 传输快多了。接口的盖子采用了磁吸式安装，开合很方便，平时没事的时候我还会拿在手里把玩。读卡器体积不算特别大，出门揣包里就可以随时随地把照片导入到手机修图。
不过，这个读卡器的插拔卡体验需要适应一番。插卡的反馈并不明显，有时候感觉阻尼很大了，但其实没有推压到底，设备无法读取。因为预留的空间较小，拔卡的时候也会比较抠手。考虑到它并不算高的售价，以及「够用」的体验，这个读卡器还算是物有所值的。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。

写在前面的话
前几年刚成为父母的时候在这儿发表过一篇总结，提到了平衡家庭和如何成为合格的父母这个话题（2020 年，按下暂停键后的思考）。几年过去了，孩子渐渐长大，催二胎的声音同样有增无减。正好趁着征文活动的额外动力再次总结，谈谈我对生孩子这件事情的看法。我明白这个话题是很有争议的，也无数次的考虑换个话题或者干脆放弃。然而这就是我近些年花大量时间思考和犹豫的内容，孩子的问题对我来说就如同是「房间里的大象」，很难视而不见。所以最终还是决定动笔，并改了不知道多少遍。
生命的神奇之处在于内在的生命力。所有可以被称作为生命的东西，都能够用各种方式一代一代的繁衍和产生后代，并通过进化或智慧与环境共存，来实现尽可能久的存在这个终极目标。我们人类也不例外。几年前我有了一个女儿。从那之后起，生活有了很多改变，催生二胎的声音也就此开始一直没有停止过，甚至比婚后催生更强烈。
我并不想生，这个决定让很多人不理解。
成为父亲的幸福和美好
首先需要澄清的是，拥有孩子并且养育她的过程会带来很多的幸福感。当然幸福不是简单的加减，很难得出结论说总体而言如何。所以仅聚焦在正面的获得。例如从非常基础的层面来说，生儿育女会让人有一种「完整感」。说不出是因为基因得到了传承，还是实现了社会和家庭的要求，看着自己的下一代会有一种生命延续的恍惚感。
作为家庭中的依赖者，突然变成了被依赖者，这是一种很难用语言形容的感觉。从一张白纸开始养一个小孩，她真的会极端信任你，从心底深处相信你说的每一个字。这份…</span>

                    <span>北京时间 2 月 9 日晚 23 点，三星正式举办 Galaxy Unpacked 新品发布会。作为三星传统艺能之一，本次发布会再次变成「新品回顾会」，主角 Galaxy S22 系列的外观设计与详细配置规格与此前的网络爆料基本一致，除此之外，Galaxy Tab S8 系列以及面向 Galaxy Watch4 的新一轮功能更新也在本次发布会上亮相。
如果你没能第一时间收看直播，不妨跟随本文一起回顾一下发布会的主要内容。
Galaxy S22/S22+
主要看点

10~120Hz 自适应屏幕，FHD+ 分辨率，支持 Vision Booster 显示增强技术
后置广角、超广角、长焦三摄，主打 AI 加持的多摄系统和夜景拍摄
电池容量分别为 3700mAh 和 4500mAh，支持最高 25W 快充
起售价分别为 799 美元、999 美元

Galaxy S22 和 Galaxy S22+ 在外观设计上与前代产品相差不大，除了照例支持 IP68 防护等级外，Galaxy S22/S22+ 的机身这次采用了铝合金边框，三星为其命名为「装甲铝边框」；正面屏幕和反面机身背板都使用了康宁大猩猩 Victus®+ 玻璃，重量分别为 167g 和 195g，小屏旗舰爱好者可以放心持握。

当然了，对细节党来说，Galaxy S22/S22+ 相比前代产品最大的进步，应该是三星作为屏幕面板行业的龙头，这次终于将自家旗舰手机的正面边框做到四边等宽了。

至于背面，Galaxy S22/S22+ 依然延续了 Galaxy S21 系列标志性的后置摄像头模组设计，并且采用了完全一致的多摄搭配方案，包括 50MP 的后置广角主摄、12MP 超广角、支持 3 倍光学变焦的 10MP 长焦、以及 10MP 的前置模组，其中主摄模组和长焦模组均支持 OIS 光学防抖。

(Photo: Laura Ockel/ Unsplash, PCMag)Over the past year there’s been a lot of digital ink spilled about pandemic-related supply chain problems, and the associated chip shortage. Industry opinions on when the shortage might ease have varied considerably. For example, Intel’s CEO has said he thinks the shortage will last through 2023, with AMD’s CEO saying…

                    <span>The Galaxy S22 series is finally here, following months of rumors, leaks, speculation, and more leaks. Just like last year, there are three models to choose from: the smallest Galaxy S22, the larger Galaxy S22 Plus, and the stylus-equipped Galaxy S22 Ultra.

“未来你愿意代表中国出战北京冬奥会吗？”
在北京昆仑鸿星冰球俱乐部成立后的第二个赛季（2017年），这是所有华裔球员在接受采访时都会被问到的问题。那个休赛期的夏天，昆仑鸿星通过运作招揽了6名华裔球员加盟——叶劲光、海云、建安、赵传礼、骆嘉、段仕能（坊间称其为“华裔六君子”），再算上建队伊始便加入俱乐部的袁俊杰和英如镝，球队里就有了8张东方面孔。

于是，开头的那个问题就成了理所当然的疑问，彼时距离北京冬奥会还有五年，这期间的不确定性极大，并且涉及国籍转换、民族情绪等等敏感问题。而面对媒体不厌其烦地提问，所有华裔球员的回答呈现出一种不约而同的标准化——
“是的，如果可以，我愿意代表中国出战2022冬奥会，但时间还很长，我们看接下来会发生什么。”

******

从某种程度来说，中国冰球选择归化，是一种顺理成章的战略。
由于冰球运动的特殊性，实力相差较大的两支球队比赛往往呈现出一边倒的局面，除了影响观赏性以外，高速度高强度的对抗甚至会给弱势一方的球员带来生命危险，因此，世界冰球按照排名分为顶级组、甲级A组、甲级B组、乙级A组、乙级B组、丙级A组、丙级B组等。除顶级组12支国家队外，其他各组均有6支球队。每年夏天各组别都要进行世锦赛，每组第一可以向上升一个档，最后一名则向下降组。
一般来说，奥运会冰球比赛只有顶级组的12支球队参加，而中国冰球无论男女队，距离这个水平都有很大的差距。
冬奥会之前，中国女冰在甲级A组，世界排名第20，历史上她们曾在1998年长野冬奥会上获得第四，这也是球队的最好成绩。随后中国女冰在2002年盐湖城以及2010年温哥华冬奥会上均获第七，之后连续两届缺席，已离开冬奥舞台12年之久。

而中国男冰则处在乙级A组，世界排名第32位，球队此前尚未打进过冬奥会。中国男冰的高光时刻还要追溯到上世纪的80年代——1981年，中国男冰参加在北…</span>

                    <span>There have been a lot of bad ideas foisted onto educators over the
course of my career. One of the ones that always pissed me off was the
use of a rubric for teacher observation. Specifically, using the
Danielson Framework. 

The Danielson Framework is a LONG laundry list of topics and concepts
and for each a teacher could be rated ineffective, developing,
effective, or highly effective.

It&#x27;s garbage.

Sure, there are some good things in the framework but using a
restrictive rubric to judge a teacher is just a bad idea. Even the
frameworks creator, Charlotte Danielson publicly stated when this
nonsense got started that the framework should not be used to evaluate
teachers. Of course departments of education would give a nod nod

Two years ago I wrote an article about rethinking web design. It got several thousands of reads and it triggered broad discussion on that topic. Most of feedback was positive, but people complained about need of web components in order to enable this new responsive style.
Here I am two years later with reworked solution, which is pure CSS based. For now, it requires Container queries polyfill. Fortunately, there has been one, done by Surma (Google dev)

                    <span>Samba is an implementation of the smb protocol that allows me to setup network shares on my linux machine that I can open on a variety of devices.
I think the homelab is starting to intrigue me enought to dive into the path of experimenting with different things that I might want setup in my own home. One key piece of this is network storage.  As I looked into nas, I realized that it takes a dedicated machine, or one virtualized at a lower level than I have capability for right now.
To get goind I am going to make a directory /srv/samba/public open to anyone on my network.  I am not going to worry too much about it, I just want something up and running so that I can learn.
Install samba, open the firewall, and edit the smb.conf
sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin sudo ufw allow samba sudo nvim /etc/samba/smb.conf

I added this to the end of my smb.conf
[public]

comment &#x3D; public share, no need to enter username and password path &#x3D; /srv/samba/public/ browseable &#x3D; yes writable &#x3D; yes guest ok &#x3D; yes

Then I made the /srv/samba/public directory and made it writable by anyone.
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/public sudo setfacl -R -m &quot;u:nobody:rwx&quot; /srv/samba/public/

I have a windows desktop in my office, primarily for my wife to run premiere pro, and my son to play Minecraft.  I walked over to it, opened the file explorer, and ernt to \\.  It asked for the username and password, I typed in the username and password of the linux device I have the share running on, and I was in.  Right there I could see the Public folder.  I opened it and made a files successfully.
I am just starting to scratch the surface of homelab, and will likely set up some more permanent things eventually.  What are some things I should look at?</span>

                    <span>The prospect of launching a website still feels incredibly exhilarating — even for those who have already launched numerous websites in the past.
But if you’re new to the game, you may have conducted some research and found that some web developers prefer to code websites in HTML, while others prefer to use something called a CMS (Content Management System).
What is HTML?
Without HTML, we would have web pages that would look no less interesting than a page of unformatted text. HTML allows us to add style to text, insert and format images, embed video, customize fonts, add color, and a whole lot more.
The example below shows you the HTML coding for Core dna’s homepage:

What is a Content Management System (CMS)?
Common CMS’ include Tumblr, WordPress, Joomla, Wix, and Drupal.
On the more advanced side of the spectrum, you’ll find ECM (Enterprise Content Management), which does everything a web CMS does, and then some. It supplements a typical web CMS features by facilitating collaboration in the workplace by integrating digital asset management, eCommerce, and document management into the mix. Going a step further, you’ll notice how most ECMs are becoming DXPs (Digital Experience Platforms), which help brands personalize content, deliver content to IoT devices, and much more.
CMS vs HTML: What is the difference?
You see, with a CMS, you can often use pre-built templates to launch web pages more quickly. You can then customize those templates to make them your own. This is obviously a lot faster than coding something from scratch, and is especially useful if you have no coding knowledge.
But besides that, there are some significant differences between HTML-only websites and CMS-powered websites.

That makes not only maintaining a website with such massive scale already a very difficult task, but creating models that use that information, like their video recommendation system, a much bigger challenge, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll go through a little today. For that, I&#x27;ll be following the structure of their paper in the subject.
These are just some of the challenges the systems has to take into consideration:

Firstly, initialize Node.js by npm init. After that install express and nodemon. If you do not know how to do it, check from this post. Create an src folder for your source. Inside src create another folder called data and put some data in it. I took my data from here. Save your data in .json files by the way.
Once you are done with that, create a main-server.js file in your root folder, so it is outside of your src folder. Should look like this 

Then, create a folder called controllers in your src folder. I will go with the albums first. Create a file called albums-controller.js and put this code there

                // If the stack is empty, set a dummy value of &#x27;#&#x27;
                char topElement &#x3D; stack.empty() ? &#x27;#&#x27; : stack.pop();
                // If the mapping for this bracket doesn&#x27;t match the stack&#x27;s top element, return false;
                if(topElement !&#x3D; hashMap.get(c)){
                    return false;
                }
            }else{
                // If it was an opening bracket, push to the stack.
                stack.push(c);
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}

Let&#x27;s do the test:
First test case:
Input:
&quot;(()){[()]}&quot;

Output:
true

And another test case:
Input:
&quot;](())&quot;

Output:
false

OK! Let&#x27;s keep practising.</span>

                    <span>Professional software development is a feedback-based process — each new iteration is informed by past results. Feedback is powered to a considerable degree by tests.
When tests slow development down, engineering teams lose momentum and become frustrated, because they can’t meet their goals. A slow test suite puts the brakes on CI/CD, making release and deployment more difficult. This often means that organizations can&#x27;t ship out products on time, and risk losing their competitive edge.
Choosing a scalable cloud platform like Semaphore is a great start. Semaphore offers some features that are helpful in dealing with slow tests, which we will discuss later in the article.
Tolerating a slow test suite is like making the minimum credit card payment when you could pay off your balance: by not …</span>

                    <span>价值 36 亿美元的被盗比特币被追回

美国司法部终于找到了在 2016 年加密货币交易所 Bitfinex 被黑期间被盗的几乎所有比特币，它们在一位音乐创作人和说唱歌手及其区块链创业公司创始人的丈夫手中。一个不确定身份的黑客将近 12 万枚比特币从交易所盗走转移到一个外部钱包，该钱包由上述夫妻控制，他们试图通过“迷宫般的加密货币交易”来 清洗被盗资金。在 2016 年这笔被盗的比特币总价值 7100 万美元。美国司法部扣押了仍在钱包中的近 95000 枚比特币，当前价值 36 亿美元。据悉，这些比特币将返还原持有者。


老王点评：就像历史上其它追回的被盗比特币一样，这相当于变相锁仓了。




默认使用双因素认证后用户信息泄漏情况减少一半

2021 年 10 月，谷歌宣布计划为目前未使用双因素认证的 1.5 亿谷歌用户默认开启，并要求 200 万 YouTube 创作者使用该服务。谷歌最近说它观察到该测试用户群中账户被泄露的情况 减少了一半。2018 年，谷歌曾透露超过 90% 的活跃 Gmail 账户没有使用双因素认证，从那时起，谷歌在一直教育用户使用双因素认证。


老王点评：双因素认证就是安全和便利的最好折中。




利用空闲的云计算来训练 AI

大规模的数据中心和云计算服务商尽管拥有大量的实例，但是也经常会有空闲的处理能力。莱斯大学的一个团队和 ThirdAI 的 研究表明，即使在网络通信不畅和低带宽互连的情况下，近 10 亿个参数的大规模网络也可以在简单的 4 到 16 个核心的 CPU 节点上进行训练，其效果与一些最好的硬件加速器相当。秘诀在于利用他们开发的算法中的哈希稀疏性，该算法被称为 D-SLIDE，是对现有 SLIDE 算法的一种改造。


老王点评：这种算法好，云服务商应该很欢迎。

                    <span>“Java” 有很多意思。除了是印度尼西亚的爪哇岛之外，它还是一个大型的软件开发生态系统。Java 公开发布于 1995 年 3 月 23 日（LCTT 译注：据维基百科数据）。它仍然是企业和休闲软件开发的一个流行平台。从银行业到“我的世界”，许多东西都是由 Java 开发的。

本文将引导你了解构成 Java 的各个组件，以及它们是如何相互作用的。本文还将介绍 Java 是如何集成在 Fedora Linux 中的，以及该如何管理不同的版本。最后，还提供了一个使用游戏《破碎的像素地牢》做的小演示。

Java 的鸟瞰图

下面几个小节快速回顾了 Java 生态系统的几个重要部分。

Java 语言

Java 是一种强类型的、面向对象的编程语言。它的主要设计者是在 Sun 公司工作的 James Gosling，Java 在 1995 年正式公布。Java 的设计受到了 C 和 C++ 的强烈启发，但使用了更精简的语法。没有指针，参数是按值传递的。整数和浮点数不再有有符号和无符号的变体，更复杂的对象如字符串是基础定义的一部分。

但那是 1995 年，该语言在发展中经历了兴衰。在 2006 年至 2014 年期间，没有任何重大发布，停滞不前，这也为市场竞争打开了大门。现在有多种竞争性的 Java 类语言，如 Scala、Clojure 和 Kotlin。现在很大一部分 “Java” 编程都使用这些替代语言规范中的一种，这些语言专注于函数式编程或交叉编译。

// Java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
  }
}

// Scala
object Hello {
  def main(…</span>

                    <span>毫无疑问，Brave 是一款出色的开源网页浏览器。它也是 适用于 Linux 的最佳网页浏览器 之一。

另一方面，Vivaldi 凭借其强劲的自定义能力和标签页管理功能，在 Linux 用户群中获得了不错的声誉。

Vivaldi 是否值得一试？它开源吗？为什么你会更喜欢 Brave 而不是它？或者，是否应该考虑使用 Vivaldi 呢？

在此，我将解答上述所有问题，并对这两款浏览器进行并列比较。

用户界面



虽然这两款网页浏览器都是基于开源的 Chromium 代码，但是它们提供了不同的用户体验。

Brave 专注于提供简洁的外观，而 Vivaldi 则尽力提供更多的功能。

如果你不想受到过多干扰，只想专心浏览网页，那么 Brave 应该能给你提供清爽的体验。

不过，Brave 也为你提供了定制现有界面的选项，例如使用更宽的地址栏、显示完整 URL、显示标签搜索按钮、显示或隐藏主页按钮等。



说到主题，Brave 默认提供了亮色和暗色两款主题，同时也支持 Chrome 应用商店中的主题。

反观另一边，Vivaldi 默认情况下看上去似乎有点满满当当的 —— 能够快速访问的侧边栏、地址栏右边的搜索框，再加上浏览器底部还有更多要素。

Vivaldi 默认也提供了更多主题。别忘了，你可以无缝地编辑、定制主题，而 Brave 可没有这种功能。



对于那些想要一款简洁明了，同时可以自定义的浏览器的人来说，Brave 就是合适的推荐项。而对于那些需要丰富的界面和大量设置项的用户来说，Vivaldi 是个不错的选择。

完全开源 vs 99% 开源

Brave 是完全开源的，可以免费 / 自由使用。你可以在 GitHub 上查看它的源代码，如果需要的话还可以复刻Fork一份代码以用于实验和测试。

Vivaldi 的话，…</span>

                    <span>一、对于一些问题的回应
最近为什么不怎么更文了？
从 2021 年 11 月份，到现在大概三个月的时间，没有发布过什么新文章。期间一波三折，经历了拆迁、装潢、搬家，很多琐事缠身，业余时间的主要精力也都放在了这本小册身上。小册在年前完成的，也算为我这平静的一年画上一个完美的句号。
现在已上架了哪些 Flutter 相关的小册？
在此之前已经发布了三本小册，分别针对 Flutter 中的 绘制 、手势 、动画 进行系统的介绍。现在，又加入了一位新兄弟 Flutter 滑动探索 ：
Painting 绘制模块 :  《Flutter 绘制指南 - 妙笔生花》
Gestures 手势模块: 《Flutter 手势探索 - 指掌天下》
Animation 动画模块 :《Flutter 动画探索 - 流光幻影》
Flutter 滑动探索：《Flutter 滑动探索 - 珠联璧合》
还会有其他的小册上架吗？
以前对 Flutter 知识体系进行过整体的规划，预计会通过 7 本小册，来全面认识 Flutter 框架。现在已经完成了四本，后续的内容会陆续进行，敬请期待~

之前的小册还会进行更新吗？
一方面，Flutter 的版本更新是比较快的，前三本小册书写时，还未使用空安全。或者 Flutter 有些破坏性的更新，会使旧版本出现问题，从而影响小册的使用。另一方面，随着本人对 Flutter 研究的深入，可能会有一些新的发现，或对之前代码的实现有一定的优化。或者一些错别字已经个人理解的偏差等。
小册定价这么低，划算吗？以后会涨价吗？
我并不是靠写文章吃饭的，所以并不太在意文字对我带来的利益。通过小册的撰写，让我有机会对 Flutter 的方方面面进行系统的梳理，其中为我技术上带来的成长与收获，是不能通过金钱来衡量的。通过我的分享，让更多人可以接触或钻研 Flutter ，本身也是一件很有意义的事。
Flutter 知识体系的七本小册，都会以 3.5 元出售，不会涨价。
二、为什么选择探索滑动体系
我们日常开发中接触到的关于滑动的知识只是冰山一角，很多人也只是了解 ListView 、PageView 等几个组件的使用而已，甚至连 NestScrollView 和 CustomScrollView 都用不好，遇到 Sliver 就头大，完全不知道该怎么玩。我在一开始对它们也没有很深刻的认识。

当认清 Flutter 滑动体系的构成及运作逻辑后，从源码的角度去认识这些组件的构成和用途，自然能站在更高的维度来使用它们。在遇到关于滑动的异常或新需求时，可以从更广阔的视角去看待问题，而非只知皮毛，管中窥豹。
风采，在手指滑动列表的那一刻，目之所见已不再仅是视口的滑动，还有滑动机制中的各个对象如何像齿轮一样啮合，驱动整个体系的运转。

为何选择滑动体系作为第四本小册内容
滑动机制 可以看做是对框架层的一个承上启下体系。向上可以连接到 滑动组件 Widget 层  ，向下可以连接到 手势 Gesture 层 、动画 Animation 层 ；在 视口 和 Sliver  内容相关实现中，还会涉及到 渲染 Rendering 层 的知识。所以选取对 滑动体系 的探索作为第四本 Flutter 小册的内容。

另外，也是很多朋友希望深入了解一下 滑动体系 ，但又苦于看不懂源码。我也比较像深入认识一下 滑动体系 ，所以决定潜心探索一下，将其过程记录下来，分享给大家。
三、 本册内容简介

第一部分主要目的是对 视口滑动 的构成进行初步的认知，其中会通过对我们最熟悉的 ListView 进行源码分析，从而引出其背后更深层的知识，以此从源码中逐步认知构成 滑动体 所必要的成分。

第二部分是对 Scrollable 和 Viewport 这两个滑动构成要素做初步的认识。主要从成员属性的角度进行介绍，并结合源码进行分析，以此对  滑动体系  有个大致的认知，为后面的探索打下基础。

第三部分是对 Sliver 进行探索，首先通过对 Sliver 组件的使用开始介绍，然后从渲染对象的角度去分析 Sliver  组件存在的必要性。其中也包含对缓存区实现的及 keepAlive 保活机制的探索。

最后一部分，是对滑动处理机制的探索。开始通过对 PageView 和 SingleChildScrollView 组件的源码实现进行分子，然后介绍 Notification 通知机制，在前面知识的铺垫下，最后对 ScrollableState 中拖动事件的回调处理进行分析。

对 Flutter 滑动体系的源码探索让我收获良多，也希望我眼中所见的光景，可以通过这本小册传达给更多人。谢谢大家一直以来的支持 ~</span>

一次配置，处处开发(Configure Once Develop Anywhere)——VScode篇

一、问题
日常开发过程中我们可能会因为各种各样的原因丢失开发环境。
电脑坏掉了。
电脑在公司没带回家，有紧急 bug 要在家解决。
团建临时使用其他同学的电脑。
又或者是某个开发环境在自己的电脑上安装不上，在别人的电脑上却可以安装，然后花费大量的时间去找问题。
python2、python3 因为路径问题而冲突
node、yarn、npm 版本不匹配。
FFmpeg 依赖的 debug 环境太过复杂，很难安装上
那么，有没有一个东西能让我们做到：
一次配置，处处开发(Configure Once Develop Anywhere) ？
非常幸运的是 Docker 能实现我们的愿望，只要我们的一切开发环境都部署在Docker上。
理想很丰满，现实很骨感。虽然python、node 这些东西都能通过命令行安装和使用，但是大部分程序员都是使用 IDE 来进行代码开发，典型的 IDE 有下面这些：
JetBrains 全家桶： IntelliJ IDEA(Java)、Android Studio(Android)、WebStorm(前端)、PyCharm(python)、Gogland(go) 等等
VSCode：大前端、python、c/c++
Vim：c/c++、go
Eclipes：Java
Visual Studio：c/c++、c# 等等
Xcode：iOS、iPad、Mac
上面这些 IDE 里面：JetBrains全家桶、VSCode、Vim、Eclipse 都能被部署到 Doc…</span>

                    <span>你好，我叫宛潼。或许你对这个名字还是有一些陌生，但如果曾经遇见过一个叫「JohnHarrod」的作者，那说明我们曾有一面之缘。这是我在少数派里写稿的第 5 年，但是 2022 年的今天，我想和你聊一个我从来没有写过，而且少数派里从来没有出现过的话题：一个非典型跨性别女性的生命体验。
没错，我算是少数派里的「少数派」。在过去的一年里，你一定或多或少听说过一些关于「跨性别者」的话题，无论是 JK 罗琳事件，还是各种各样关于厕所问题的争论。幸运的是，我们通过这样那样的话题走进了你们的视野中，让你们知道了我们这样一群人的存在。而不幸的是，似乎关于我们的这些话题，都没有带给你们很好的印象。
但是不用担心，这篇文章我不会谈及上面这些社会话题，就当是一个普通的过来人和你聊聊我这些年的一些经历。所以，不妨静下心来，走进一个真实「少数派」的内心世界吧。
苦难与逃避
每一个人的成长都需要经历认知自我的过程。对于顺性别者而言，性别认知觉醒也许并不是一个需要特别去在意的命题；但对于跨性别者来说，认知自己的过程，往往就是经历苦难的过程。它不单单只是青春期第二性征发育与自身所期待的方向所逆反而带来的焦虑，更多的是那些在阳光之下的阴暗经历。
各种各样的调查报告数据会告诉你，他们经常是校园暴力的受害者，他们患抑郁和双相等精神疾病的概率比常人高好几倍，他们面临的家庭压力和工作压力要比普通人要严重得多……然而，数据是冷冰冰的，没有人会真正的去理解一件他未曾经历的事情。就像我被顺性别者问到最多的问题，就是「你们为什么要选择去毁坏自己的身体，成为另一个性别的人？」
数据来源：《2017 中国跨性别群体生存现状调查报告》
似乎大众所关注的话题，都只停留在了「手术」这一件事情上。人们总是对这种与性有关的话题感到好奇，却不会有太多人真正地去看到他们到底经历了一些什么。
一个很明显的现象是，跨性别者往往都有一个被校园暴力…</span>

                    <span>菲茨杰拉德在他 29岁那年出版了《了不起的盖茨比》，在他 44 岁的时候去世。贾谊在他二十几岁时写出了《过秦论》，而后死于 32 岁这个年纪。或许每个创作者在三十岁左右的年纪都会陷入怀疑：对照着历史你会看到这条路径上已经有无数人在这个年纪创作出了伟大的作品，自己尚且一事无成。而同样这个年纪已经是世俗意义上需要拥有点什么的年纪（体面的工作，稳定的爱侣，温馨的家庭等等），而之前尚且能够规避世俗拷问的遮掩都已消失时，该如何面对现实生活。
而事实上，电影《倒数时刻》（Tick, Tick…Boom!）就描述了这个问题。加菲所饰演的 Jon 手里有一部他写了数年的音乐剧本，同时还有一个已经厌倦他只能做餐厅侍者，等待着某日剧本被百老汇的大人物赏识的女友，以及离开破旧出租屋放弃旧日梦想给资本贩卖自己时间的好友  Michael，而最重要的是：他还有两个周就年满三十岁了。
这部影片实际上就是 Jonathan Larson 的自传电影，甚至他的另一部作品《Rent》中很多灵感也来自于他自己的真实生活：他曾跟他的室友曾一起住在一栋破公寓，公寓没有门房，所以他必须把钥匙丢下楼给访客。他也和一位舞者在一起长达四年，最终这名舞者离去。他同样也有许多朋友死于艾滋。所以多元文化，性少数群体以及艾滋病等议题同样出现在这部电影里，然而归根结底，这是一部描写创作者的电影。早先和朋友聊天时感慨，我们总着眼于创作者所创作出来的东西，然而却鲜少讨论他们创作的困境与遭遇，他们是如何独自一人走过那些幽暗的光阴才创作出那些作品的呢？钱钟书说「假如你吃了个鸡蛋觉得不错，何必认识那下蛋的母鸡呢？」（《记钱钟书与〈围城〉》），但那只鸡蛋是如何出现的，为什么能出现鸡蛋而不是其他的这件事依然重要。
在影片里， Jon 给出了一个不错的答案：真实。他的第一部音乐剧叫好不叫座，他试图抨击这个时代的人们过于迷恋银幕，将生活遗忘在了一旁…</span>

                    <span>焦虑：
2020年年底，匆匆忙忙学习了2个来月，就去参加研究生考试。我依然记得那个12月，每天都被焦虑环绕，仿佛如果没考上，人生就迎来了末日。末日当然不会降临，因为第二天太阳照常升起，因为第二天我依然能左手老婆右手儿子。不过我从这次匆忙的考研这个偶然经历中，发现了一个必然：

我似乎找到了应对焦虑的方法

考完后去拜菩萨，我给2021年的「我」许下了一些愿望，也给自己卸下了一些包袱。趁儿子出去霍霍的那些空档，我挑选了一些我得到收获的领域，阐述了这些领域焦虑的来源，以及摆脱他们的方法。如果你不小心读到这篇文章，或许你能从我过去这一年的碎碎念中，得到些什么。
考研：
决定去考研这个抉择，其实初衷只是想有更好的职业晋升通道，我肯定不会告诉你其实是薅公司羊毛，因为给报销学费。平心而论，我并不认为我擅长读书和考试，因为本科学校非常普通（证明学习能力普通），选个不考数学跟政治的专业给自己降低点难度，因此原计划是读个MBA，混一下人脉跟学历。好死不死的是在报名的时候居然发现心仪的学校开设了应用心理的非全日制专硕，脑子一热就报了。
无用的焦虑：
报名一时爽，备考火葬场。多达9本的专业课、英语一、政治，三座大山带来的焦虑在仅剩的2个月里全线飘红。焦虑来源非常直接：

历年英语一真题卷只能做到客观题平均分50分，翻译、小作文、大作文全体抓瞎；
政治仅听了一遍徐涛的课程，公众号的背诵联盟也无法跟上，真题也没做几套；
9本专业课连看一遍也没能做到。

如今回头复盘，在那 2 个月里，备考压力所产生的焦虑冲垮了我的理性思维。我每天学习到1点，却依然记不住昨天早上背的 60 个单词；我反复翻看笔记，却依然记不住各大中共会议的要点；记不住什么是拉瑟福德频率理论，更学不明白假设检验。结局自然可以预见：政治 67，英语一 68，专业课 168。
我必须先解决焦虑问题，带着焦虑去学习，越学越崩溃。考完后我疲惫…</span>

                    <span>写在软装前
回顾2021年，让我最头疼又最有成就感的事，便是从去年10月起，将我的小户型二手房进行了改造。在农历虎年前，完成了硬装部分，逐步开始进入软装，年后将有全屋定制柜进场，以及部分家具的进场。本文整体较长，前言我不多赘述，立马进入正文。
客厅视角
回顾装修
不可否认第一次装修，装修前我轻视了这件事的复杂程度。装修初期我面对巨大的焦虑，装修中有更多临时的问题冒出来。焦虑最主要来源于对很多事情的不熟悉。对90后来说最熟悉的可能就是网络，但对于水、电、煤几乎都是没有怎么接触过。装修期间我常常感叹，自己生活中那些「理所当然」好像本来就应该存在在那的事情，总是要花费我最多的精力和经费。
对于「我总共有哪些事」，「要经历哪些事」不清楚，是焦虑的首要原因。其次，当面对一个装修问题的时候，总是会牵动到其他相关的事项上，为了解决一个问题就需要面对大量的信息，学习、比较。
总结下来两大最主要的问题，也是本文想通过对自己装修过程中踩的坑、获得的经验复盘的目的：「对装修项目全貌的了解」和「处理信息过载的办法」。希望可以帮助到即将开展装修，或是正在装修的同学们，对装修的一个整体的认识，快速走出焦虑。如果将我装修中遇到的事情一一整理展开，可能篇幅长的过于夸张，我重点将我踩的坑与建议分享给大家，也给自己未来的装修做好备忘录。
我把整个装修项目分成三大方面：事、人、财。分别是我们需要面对的事、对接的人以及需要花费的钱。我使用到的工具是 飞书 与 Powerpoint ，分别用来整理事物与照片资料。
事
想要更好的掌控我们的装修，我觉得首先要从「一共有多少事」入手，了解和清晰我们总共需要经历哪些阶段，完成哪些工作，再到注意哪些细节。在没有对整体全貌有所了解时，对任何细节的注意都是有些捡了芝麻丢了西瓜的。其次是从自己的角度，打开小红书一搜装修，都是满满的成品展示，很难控制自己的注意力不忘厨房具体的一个「…</span>

                    <span>前言
环境介绍
我的寝室是一个大约15平的双人间，由于不是上床下桌，两个人的床和衣柜占据了寝室中绝大多数空间，剩下留给我的私人空间，仅是一张 120cm 长，带有书架的学习桌，加上周围零零碎碎的空间，总共约 4 平米大小。在这个不大的空间内，仅仅放下两台显示器都稍显局促，可能学校在设计之初就并不希望我们花费大把的时间浪费在寝室的书桌上（笑）。
图源自网络
在这个不大的空间内，原本我并没有什么期待，能够打个游戏/吃个外卖，就已经不错了。我是一个爱折腾的人，在远在 1300KM 的家中，我早就部署好了全屋 HomeKit，无死角的 Wi-Fi 网络，NAS 等等极客爱玩的东西。但是对着寝室这巴掌大的地方，对于狭小空间无数次的失望和抱怨充斥这我学习之外的时间。“为什么不让他变得更舒适”，自从疫情返校之后，这个想法就一直萦绕在我的脑中。
舒适的网络，是一切的开始
网络是现代人生活的基础，也是我们与世界连接的桥梁。好的网络环境是我们这些科技爱好者舒适生活的大前提，然而我们宿舍的网络环境并算不上优秀。
宿舍的基础网络，问题很多
现在的校园，基本上都是以教育网为主，我们学校也是如此。校园网有其独特的优势比如：

每一个分配的 IP 都是独立的教育网公网 IP
上行带宽大
访问学术网站可以有文献库授权
在校内即使网段不一样也可以通过三层交换机互相访问1

但是纵使有这些优点校园网对我来说也有一些不可忽视的问题：

校园网需要繁琐的认证过程
受限于公网IP的数量，每个学生只能有 5 个设备同时在线。
由于宿舍建造时间比较久远，宿舍内的网口最高只支持 100Mbps
按流量计费

繁琐的认证对于桌面设备而言还有简洁的办法，但是对于移动设备而言可以说是灾难级的体验，特别是学校封锁了 HTTP 认证方式而全部转为 HTTPS 认证之后。不过好在学校也开放了 802.1x 的认证方式，使得移动端的体…</span>

                    <span>作为我派资深读者和入门作者，遇事不决搜索少数派已经成了习惯性动作。
但当我即将成长为一个新手爸爸时，想在少数派找寻一些关于孕期或者育儿的经验，却发现信息寥寥，无从下手。
搜索我派，(截止20211222）只有6篇孕期相关文章，且大部分只是提及“孕期”二字
所以打算记录自己的一些经验分享给后来者作为参考。
当我写了四千字时，才发现如果想把孕期注意事项和所见所闻写完整还需要数个四千字，所以只能列一个框架，供大家参考，后续我会挑选一些关键的节点写到奶爸系列里（本文角色暂称孕爸）。
孕期三个阶段和反应
孕妈在怀孕后的不同阶段会有诸多不良反应，包括但不限于：
孕初期：1-12周
呕吐：很多孕妈从呕吐开始识别到自己可能怀孕，但并非每个孕妇都会呕吐，同时也未必会仅仅出现在孕初期，中后期依旧可能出现反胃等生理现象。
胃口差：随着孕周增加，逐渐开始阶段性排斥一些食物，比如我爱人无法吃芹菜，有段时间又很喜欢鸡蛋羹。
孕中期：13-27周
身体不适：胎儿身体逐渐长大，羊水增多，会挤压孕妈肝脾胃等器官，容易造成肾积水，腰背疼痛等症状。出现这些反应时请及时咨询医师，适时调整睡姿，适当引导胎儿姿势等，并在必要的时候进行干预。
少食多餐：胃部被挤压后进食变少，为了保障营养，需要增加进餐次数，并确保营养。
睡眠不佳：由于身体内部诸多器官被挤压，同时又要注意睡姿，所以很多孕妈夜间睡眠会质量较差，这时候要孕爸要尽可能协助孕妈疏导心态并调整白天工作强度，确保每天睡眠质量。
孕晚期：28-40周
水肿：很多孕妇会出现腿部，脚踝，足部的水肿。
漏尿：因为胎儿持续往下，会挤压膀胱肌，造成孕妈控制力下降，容易发生漏尿。需要特别提醒各位孕爸的一点是，如果太太发生漏尿，请务必保持必要的尊重，这对女孩子来说是一件羞耻的事，我们应该尽可能消减她们的压力，而不是相反。
耻骨疼痛：同因为胎儿向下，会引起孕妈的间歇性疼痛，不严重的话…</span>

本文会介绍如何通过 Shortcut 来从 Unsplash 中随机挑选一张壁纸。下面是 GIF 演示：

关于 Shortcut 的基本原理，我派已经有很多篇非常优秀的文章去解释了，本文不做过多讲解，只会贴一些如何配置的截图。
 
要想达成这个技巧，你至少需要准备以下工作：

注册 Unsplash 账号
获取 Unsplash 开发者 Access Key
了解基本的 Shortcut 使用方式

第三点不是必要的，因为我会在文末分享我的 Shortcut，你只需要在导入它的时候填一下你注册的 Access Key 就可以了。
本文为了方便，大部分 Shortcut 界面截图都是基于 macOS 12.1 的版本。如果你只有 iOS 设备，不要觉得陌生，在界面上应该差距不会太大。
那么我们开始吧～
获取 Unsplash Access Key
没有账号的话，需要先在官网注册。在注册成功后，回到主站，可以看到右上角的汉堡图标。
点击「汉堡」图标打开菜单
点击后就可以看到 Developers。

或者，你直接输入 https://unsplash.com/developers 就好了🌚
 
进入开发者站点后，我们点击 「your apps」。

接着点击 「New Application」。

条款界面全部选上即可。

接着就是输入你的 App 名字，我们就叫它 「My automation tool」吧～

点击「Create application」并成功进入开发者管理后台后，应该可以看到：

                    <span>我们总想追求更加舒适的网页浏览体验，继上次向大家分享实用、有趣的浏览器扩展之后又过去了将近半年的时间，期间又有哪些好用、有趣的「新玩意」和值得关注的更新呢？
本文为你搜集了 9 款值得一试的浏览器扩展。
标签分组扩展

让标签分组功能更合你心意。

引入标签页分组功能后，Google 和微软在打磨基础体验之外，并未围绕这一功能进行太大幅度的开发与更新。现目前我们在 Chrome 和 Edge 中能够体验到的标签分组功能实在是非常有限，因此市面上也出现了不少专门对标签分组功能进行增强的扩展。如果你的需求只是想要原生标签分组功能更好用一点，「标签分组扩展」这款小工具就是一个不错的选择。
「标签分组扩展」的核心功能分为增强、快照和自动化分组三部分。
其中增强部分算是对原生标签分组功能的「再整理」，安装好扩展并将其固定至扩展栏后，「标签分组扩展」可以通过弹出浮窗的方式提供一个更为直观的标签分组管理面板。标签页的分组、折叠以及激活状态都能通过清晰的树状图展示出来，同时，我们也能通过这个面板接触到「标签分组扩展」的高级功能。
标签分组扩展主界面
比如为网页标签或标签组保存快照，保存的快照可供后续访问，在「标签分组扩展」的面板中还能进一步向已经保存的快照添加标签或编辑快照内的页面信息，如果你有需要按组保存网页「稍后再读」的需求，「标签分组扩展」比起原生标签分组功能显然更能满足你。
分组自动化功能则允许我们在 Chrome 和 Edge 自动分组归纳的基础上，根据实际需要进一步定制自动分组策略。分组规则目前支持域名、完整 URL 和网页标题，命中规则的网页标签在打开时会自动归纳进入想要的标签组当中，用起来还是比较省时省力的。
自动分组规则设置
你可以在 Chrome 网上应用商店 或 Edge 外接程序商店 下载「标签分组扩展」。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #效率 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

近年来，极简理念时不时会被人们提起，引发了不少讨论，围绕极简理念展开的实践也层出不穷。单纯从少数派站内搜索，每年均有极简主题的文章。这些文章或从数字生活的实践出发，分享自己的极简体系；或从反映极简文化的理论出发，分享改善自己生活的经验；或对「极简」展开追问，反思「极简」的极限和衍生问题。这些文章对我们个人极简体系的搭建提供了不少可资参考的材料，且在操作指导上也比较详实。
与极简相关的站内文章
在落笔前，我在思考是否有必要再分享自己的经验，因为，该说的大多数都说过了，而我自己的体系也许并没有其他人的更好。最终落笔，则是因为想通了以下几点：
第一，纸上得来终觉浅，从《断舍离》这些反映极简理念的书籍中得出的实践不能说不好，但是否适合自己还要另说，「极简」有共性，但实践只能是个人体验；
第二，多数文章都是「自上而下」的实践，先有理论，再有操作，但这篇文章的经验却是「自下而上」的总结，是我在没有读过任何一本极简理念书籍前提下的摸索；
第三，再不济，文章也是对自己这一年来的经验总结，侥幸上了首页还能赚些稿费补贴家用。
文章分三大部分：第一部分写我的极简理念，第二部分写我的实践，主要是数字生活上的一些小实践，最后介绍极简体系的维持。为了便于理解，把理念阐释得有趣一些，第一部分有些天马行空，把各种不同领域的东西「混杂」在了一起，还望大家见谅。
读完本文，如果能对你有所帮助自然是好，如若觉得文章观点偏颇，还望朋友们在评论区不吝赐教。

从一票联想越来越难拆，到拧螺丝三分钟加内存十五秒的老电脑，还有五次投标把每次全投标组的电脑都升级一轮，这几年笔者确确实实搞了不少机。像我司的办公性质，基本都是画个图、相关软件导出和各种办公文档这些工作内容，一般对处理器的要求并不高，所以最后基本都是加内存换固态的事。

大部分单位应该都与我司工作需求相同，很多旧款笔记本升级下完全能够满足大多数人的需要。不管是自己的旧电脑升级还是选购二手笔记本都是一个更为划算的选择。当然二手本的市场需求相对小众，对相关知识的要求门槛更高，价格浮动水平较大，并且绝大部分需要个人有相应的动手能力。仅针对市面上 x86/64 笔记本的选择与相关配件进行介绍与推荐，文中所提及的价格水平仅供参考。

2021 年的笔记本市场反应，也证明了 7nm 的 4000/5000 系列锐龙处理器在性价比上一路高歌，但高性能本还是伴随着矿潮缺货，需要预购甚至加价。而随着 EVO 认证和 Tiger Lake 的出现而成为标配的雷电 4，至今也只能使用雷电 3 的外设。
随着 6000 系锐龙移动端与 12 代 Intel 移动端处理器的上线，笔记本市场可能面临更残酷的洗牌。不过真的是所有人都需要那么「强大」的性能么？很多人的实用需求并不严苛，仅仅是想入手一台便宜机器使用， 该怎么办呢？

1.导言
游戏商业化，在游戏市场和游戏行业一直是不少游戏策划和运营人员研究和思考的问题。
游戏类型和用户人群的不同，往往决定了其采取的商业化体系不同，也造就了游戏商业化的多样性。
但其实随着行业的发展和行业前辈的摸索、推进，网络游戏的商业化已经是非常成熟的一套体系了。
什么是游戏的商业化？

就是将游戏内容通过一定的商业化活动和商业化手段，售卖给游戏用户的行为。
像6元首充、投资理财、节日限时活动等等都是游戏商业化的具象。
也正是因为这一套体系已经日趋成熟，加上市场泛用性较强，所以我们不难发现，很多新上市的游戏，其商业化体系几乎都是一样的套路。
在这里我不讨论游戏商业化的合理性和必要性之类的内容。
本文主要是探究网络游戏商业化设计的又一个重大创举——Battle Pass，即战斗通行证。
主要通过细致讲解Battle Pass的设计细节，探究其设计逻辑和可供我们游戏策划借鉴的点。
也希望能通过对这一个商业化系统的剖析，细致阐述游戏商业化系统的设计逻辑，即用户参与、用户行为、用户需求三个核心点。
希望能对初入行或者想了解这一块内容的小伙伴起到一定的帮助。

                    <span>这位是Tomas Mezera，1988年Bathurst 1000的冠军，一生赢了不少比赛。
现在他是澳大利亚保时捷竞技驾驶学校的最资深的教练以及教学项目管理。

他也是我学习驾驶的导师。
成为车手和做其它什么事情都是一样，花钱花时间都能入门，但是要获得更高层次的成功，需要的还有天赋和运气。
跟Tom学开车后，一方面我加入了保时捷邪教，只信保时捷。
另一方面也学到了如何成为一个更好的竞赛车手。
说到头，学开车和学弹琴是一样的，要有好老师，但更多是要多练，有天赋固然好，可是天赋敌不过兴趣和投入，很多人看到职业XX，不管是NBA球员也好，还是看到电子竞技职业选手也好，看到他们在场上那潇洒的一瞬间都会觉得很帅，自己也想那样。
但实际上背后是非常辛苦的训练，非常枯燥的重复，很长时间的瓶颈，一些难以克服的恶习，一些你觉得不可能实现的目标。这些你以前在学其它东西遇到过的，都会在赛车上遇到。
学习赛道上的竞技驾驶，你越学越发现你开始学的太晚了，你能力，金钱和投入太有限了。
首先你需要学会开慢，慢出自己的节奏。
新车手都喜欢大开大合，油门踩到底，刹车踩到底。
之后经过训练，会学会开车像弹琴一样，有起伏有节奏，不能一个音一个音断断续续，要一直源源不绝的走。一个赛道开好了，仿佛唱一首歌，一路唱完，中间仿佛听不到喘息的声音，而不是唱一句，吸口气，再唱。
然后有了节奏之后开始学习如何开快，如何克服恐惧去挑战自己和车的极限。
再之后学习理论，了解赛道和角度，一个赛道外道入弯的时候你少用了几分米的赛道，角度不如别人的好，5圈下来你可能就少了几个车身的距离甚至更糟。
等你到这个级别了，就要开始学习驾驶规则，一些比赛常识，学习自己准备比赛，学习自己练习。
学习如何超车，如何防止别人超车。
这一步再学完了，你才勉强算是成为了一个外行，然后如果你要参加稍微正式点的比赛，而不只是trackday的练习，你很可…</span>

                    <span>有人说“底盘调校是对汽车底盘工程师的灵魂之问！”
底盘调校是什么？为什么车企会不惜重金聘请外国专家进行底盘调校？奔驰偏向舒适，宝马偏向运动，而奥迪则是两者取乎其中，是调出来的吗？
下面让我们抽丝剥茧，看看什么是底盘调校？
发动机被人们比作汽车的心脏，底盘就可看作是汽车的骨骼，它涉及动力传动系统、行驶系统（主要包括车架、悬架、车轮）、转向系统和制动系统，底盘技术的好坏直接影响到汽车安全性、操控性、舒适性等，可谓牵一发而动全身。
一、什么是底盘调校 
汽车底盘性能如木桶效应：没有经过调校的样车存在各种各样的短板，例如：过弯侧倾大、不足转向度大、弯道抓地力不足、制动点头大及冲击舒适度差等问题，无法让用户满意。底盘调校过程是补齐或平衡各项性能，增大性能“存水量”。
著名的km77麋鹿测试

汽车要拥有优秀的底盘性能取决于前期基础结构设计、后期底盘调校工作和生产一致性控制三个方面。其中，基础结构设计性能贡献占比约为60%，底盘调校约为30%，生产一致性控制占比约为10%。即基础结构设计是底盘性能达标的前提，底盘调校是性能再拔高的过程，生产一致性控制是底盘性能的最终保障。
底盘调校是在有限的成本和资源条件下，整合各个子系统和零部件，协调各种矛盾，通过调校的手段找到各方面性能的最佳平衡点，以满足既定的性能开发目标。
二、底盘调校主要方法 
一直以来各汽车企业把底盘调校作为看家本领，其技术的复杂性及难度在整车性能开发过程中不言而喻。汽车性能一般用动力性、燃油经济性、制动性、操纵稳定性、平顺性和通过性等评价指标来评价，整车调校主要围绕这些指标开展相应的工作。一般提到的底盘调校更多的是指在底盘性能调校过程中，如何提升底盘整体性能并保证舒适性和操控性的最佳平衡。
汽车要具有良好的转向性能、操纵稳定性以及行驶舒适性，一方面在设计时要优化车辆整体架构，使之具有好的K&amp;C性能，涉及到悬架系统的硬点、转…</span>

Telegram bots
Telegram, one of the biggest messenger platform, offers a Bot API that allows third-party automation. Users can start chatting with bots and these bots can send
message to users. This opens a wide range of what’s possible on the platform: sending commands to a system, receiving security notifications, or any
other integration.
Since you, the developer, control the bot, you can define how it interacts with your environment. It could start EC2 instances, monitor Kubernetes clusters in
GCP, or send a notification when a backup is completed. Or the tea.
Why build on an existing platform and not start a separate project, probably a website?
With Telegram, you get push notifications, account security with 2-factor authentication (phone number and an …</span>

                    <span>Sometimes when you&#x27;re running a Lighthouse performance check on your sites, you might come across the issue:
 element does not have a [lang] attribute

Luckily, this is a pretty easy thing to fix, whether you&#x27;re using Next.js, or plain ol&#x27; HTML!
It&#x27;s for accessibility! Screen readers often use a different sound library for each language they support. They can easily switch between those sound libraries, but only when a webpage specifies which language to use.
Typically in your average Next.js website, the deployed page ships only a 
 wrapped site, with no language attribute attached.
If you were writing a plain HTML website (or using some other library that allows you to update the shipped HTML files), it would be a simple matter of adding a lang&#x3D;&quot;en&quot; to your outputted HTML, like so:


With Next.js, it&#x27;s a little bit more involved, but luckily not too difficult!
Inside of your pages/ directory (or wherever you put your page components), make a file called _document.js. This overrides the default document that is shipped with your Next.js site. Don&#x27;t worry though, we won&#x27;t break anything!
Inside of that file, add the following:
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from &#x27;next/document&#x27;

export default function Document() {
  return (
     {/* Add whichever language you want here */}
      
      
        
        
      
    
  )
}

Boom, you&#x27;re done! Make sure you don&#x27;t delete the Html, Head, Main, and NextScript components, because they are required for your site to be properly rendered. Now, next time you run your performance and accessibility audits, your language settings should be in the clear!</span>

It&#x27;s not a big secret that building a developer portfolio can greatly increase your chances of getting hired.
Everyone tells you that. But, they don&#x27;t always tell you what makes a good one.
You see, many portfolios are generic and rather uninspiring. If your portfolio looks just like everyone else&#x27;s, then how can you expect it to stand out?
Well, it won&#x27;t stand out.
But don&#x27;t worry – I&#x27;ve been there. My first portfolio was bland, uninspiring, and had many of the not-to-do&#x27;s I talk about in this post.
However, I&#x27;m an ex-marketer, turned developer, I know how to make something stand out. I&#x27;ve made ad campaigns that have skyrocketed sales and had people talking. I realized I needed to think like a marketer to make my portfolio stand out.

                    <span>I am 31 years old and I didn&#x27;t knew this. Everytime I wanted to scrape some data table from a website I had to run a script to do it for me, when in fact it was so easy... like a walk in a park.
Let&#x27;s have a brief example of what I mean. So how do you go from this...

to this...

... in less than 10 seconds.
All you need is the page you want to get the data from, in my case it&#x27;s this one, and the  Excel app opened (you can use Google drive as well).
We will use the IMPORTXML function which takes as parameters an url, an xpath_query and a locale. All we need is to pass the url and the xpath_query of the table.
Our single line of code will look like this:
&#x3D;IMPORTXML(&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population&quot;, &quot;//tr&quot;)


So basically we are telling the program to fetch any table row from the page and display it in our sheet. Easy, right?
Remember that you can modify the xpath_query to fetch anything from the page.  For example, if I want to fetch the 22nd row of the table I change the function like this:
&#x3D;IMPORTXML(&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population&quot;, &quot;//table[1]/tbody/tr[24]&quot;)

Isn&#x27;t it awesome? I bet it is. Hope you&#x27;ve learned something! :)</span>

A very data intense book.
It made me smile that there is one chapter dedicated to the perils of distributed programming, when the fact is that the whole book is a warning after another of all the possible things that can go wrong.
We are doomed.
Reliability: Systems should work correctly even in the face of adversity, including human error.
Every legacy system is unpleasant on its own way.
Data models affect how we think about the problem that we are solving.

Changing landscape of how enterprises are organizing their teams, resources, and budgets.
The entire supply chain being power-driven by APIs
Ordering food to having it delivered to your doorstep
Requesting a cab and tracking it from beginning to end
Streaming channels and shows to televisions, computers, and mobile phones around the world
Ordering groceries and having them delivered from the store to your door.

                    <span>Anyone who’s been in a rapidly scaling company with an ever-expanding engineering team knows that communication is never as simple as it seems. 
That’s why we were so excited when Shankar Ramaswamy decided to sit down with Dev Interrupted.
Shankar is a veteran leader in the engineering space, having helped recruit, build and guide developer teams at companies like Amazon, eBay, Paypal and Google - where before leaving he managed a team of 300+ people. 
Now the Head of Engineering at Datastax, Shankar took the time to talk to us about some of the practical lessons he’s learned managing teams of several hundred people, and why something he calls the “intent perception gap” is so tricky for managers to get right. 
We also took the time to talk about Shankar’s views on the future of cloud computing, what healthy conflict looks like at unicorn companies and why you might want to rethink your single-vendor strategy.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



(2:54) Shankar’s career from product management at eBay to eng at PayPal

(5:35) Why Amazon is the only place where junior devs argue about customer experience
(11:52) What is the intent perception gap? 
(19:06) Future of cloud computing

(21:07) Why single vendor strategies are a bad idea
(32:19) Devs have no formal training to handle people problems

                    <span>I see and hear of so many teams stuck on estimating tasks, but estimates almost always have a hopelessly poor signal-to-noise ratio. There are better ways of working!
Here&#x27;s the thing: If you can demonstrate your estimations predictably and reliably map to clear buckets of cycle times then, okay, your estimates provide a signal (but there&#x27;s still an easier way of working). But I have effectively never seen that happen. Inevitably estimates do not reliably map to actual time spent, and actually almost no-one even does that analysis so they just go on blind faith that estimates provide a signal. Most of us got into estimates just because it was part of the scrum ceremonies that snuck in during the 2000s, and it&#x27;s beyond time we question it!
Let&#x27;s be clear: If estimates don&#x27;t map to actual ti…</span>

                    <span>Recentemente tive que implementar uma padronização de breakpoints para deixar responsivo uma aplicação.
Nessa aplicação usando o Material UI, a lib  me traz uma série de valores de breakpoints já definidos, porém a ideia era centralizar esses valores em um único lugar..
1 -Foi criado o  customHook &quot;useSkillsMediaQuery&quot;.
Bom, com isso traz uma certa manutenibilidade e padronização bem mais definida e isolada.

Porém  é difícil para debugar e reconhecer  os valores de cada variável..
É ai que vem o useDebugValue..
2 - Com o useDebugValue eu passei um objeto informando o valor de cada variável em especifica e o valor de seu breakpoint, ou seja cada item do objeto possui um objeto e dentro desse objeto retorna &#x27;true&#x27; ou &#x27;false&#x27; informando se a tela se encaixa no seu valor, além de uma descrição informando a sua largura minima(min-width).

Entendeu, haha?
3 - Bom, inspecionando o componente onde o useSkillsMediaQuery foi chamado e  ao diminuir ou aumentar a tela do navegador,  usando o React DevTools é possivel ver essas informações.

                    <span>英伟达收购 ARM 交易失败

英伟达在当地时间 2 月 7 日的董事会上决定放弃收购 ARM。此前美国、英国和欧盟监管机构就此交易对全球半导体行业竞争的影响提出严重关切。这笔交易是芯片行业有史以来规模最大的一笔交易，最高曾达 870 亿美元。ARM 的技术是全球大多数移动设备的核心。高通和微软等几家依赖 ARM 芯片设计的大型科技公司曾反对此次收购。软银将获得最高 12.5 亿美元的 交易终止费，它将寻求在年底前对 ARM 进行 IPO。


老王点评：很多国家和 IT 企业并不希望 ARM 被收购，这毕竟这对别人来说都不算什么好事。




英特尔加入 RISC-V 国际

虽然英特尔已经有了基于 RISC-V 的处理器，但看来英特尔短期内不会用 RISC-V 取代 x86_64。英特尔加入了 RISC-V 国际，成为首席成员，这一举措 应该是希望吸引更多的客户加入英特尔代工服务，领先的 RISC-V 芯片设计公司 SiFive 已经是其客户。英特尔还将赞助一个开源软件开发平台，帮助 RISC-V 发展其开源软件。


老王点评：不能消灭就拥抱，这很熟悉，对吧？




谷歌云增加加密挖矿检测能力

这项名为“虚拟机威胁检测”（VMTD）的 新功能 是一个无代理系统，它会持续扫描部署在谷歌云环境中的虚拟机内存，以发现 CPU 或 GPU 使用量增加的蛛丝马迹，尤其是加密运算。该功能默认是禁用的，客户需要自行启用。该功能只对非敏感内存起作用，VMTD 不会检查来自标记为“机密”的节点的内存。


老王点评：这个功能对谷歌云及其客户都是有意义的，我想其它的云服务商也应该有类似举措。</span>

                    <span>使用 Linux 的 grep 和 fgrep 命令来赢得你最喜欢的基于单词的猜测游戏。


我最近有点迷恋上了一个在线单词猜谜游戏，在这个游戏中，你有六次机会来猜一个随机的五个字母的单词。这个词每天都在变化，而且你每天只能玩一次。每次猜测后，你猜测中的每个字母都会被高亮显示：灰色表示该字母没有出现在神秘单词中，黄色表示该字母出现在单词中，但不在那个位置，绿色表示该字母出现在单词中的那个正确位置。

下面是你如何使用 Linux 命令行来帮助你玩像 Wordle 这样的猜测游戏。我用这个方法来帮助我解决 1 月 6 日的谜题：

第一次尝试

Linux 系统在 /usr/share/dict/words 文件中保存了一个单词词典。这是一个很长的纯文本文件。我的系统的单词文件里有超过 479,800 个条目。该文件既包含纯文本，也包含专有名词（名字、地点等等）。

为了开始我的第一次猜测，我只想得到一个长度正好是五个字母的纯文本词的列表。要做到这一点，我使用这个 grep 命令：

$ grep &#x27;^[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]$&#x27; /usr/share/dict/words &gt; myguess


grep 命令使用正则表达式来进行搜索。你可以用正则表达式做很多事情，但为了帮助我解决 Wordle 问题，我只需要基本的东西。^ 表示一行的开始，$ 表示一行的结束。在两者之间，我指定了五个 [a-z] 的实例，表示从 a 到 z 的任何小写字母。

我还可以使用 wc 命令来查看我的可能单词列表，“只有” 15,000 个单词：

$ wc -l myguess
15034 myguess


从这个列表中，我随机挑选了一个五个字母的单词：acres。a 被设置为黄色，意味着该字母存在于神秘单词的某处，但不在第一位置。其他字…</span>

                    <span>Fragments 2.0 的发布使其成为 Linux 发行版中最方便用户使用的 BitTorrent 客户端之一。让我们来看看有什么新变化。




Fragments 是 Linux 上最好的 BitTorrent 客户端之一。

最新的 Fragments 2.0 是一个重大升级，它使用 Rust、GTK 4 和 Libadwaita 从头开始完全重写。

除了技术上的改进之外，你还会发现一些新的功能和改进的用户界面。

让我重点介绍一下它的变化。

Fragments 2.0 的新变化



最近，Gnome 应用程序的生态系统经历了一些大规模的变化。在这个变化的最前沿是向 Gtk4 和 Libadwaita 的过渡。不幸的是，这种变化并不小，许多应用程序需要从头开始重建，以支持这些新标准。

与许多其他应用程序开发者一起，Fragment 的开发者 Felix Häcker 决定从头开始重建 Fragments，现在作为 Fragments 2.0 发布。因此，我们现在得到了一个改进的 Linux 的 BitTorrent 客户端。

其中的一些改进包括。


一个基于 Libadwaita 的漂亮的新用户界面

新的模块化架构

能够被用作远程 Fragments / Transmission 会话的远程控制

新的偏好对话框有更多的选项

能够查看有关网络的统计数据


一个新的用户界面



Fragments 2.0 现在有一个基于 Libadwaita 的新 UI。补充一句，Libadwaita 是 GTK4 对 Gnome 应用程序的一个扩展。它有几个优点，最明显的是在所有 Gnome 应用程序中具有一致的外观。

它比旧的主题更加扁平和圆润，我觉得，看起来非常时尚。

你可以得到一个外观简洁的 BitTo…</span>

                    <span>Generally, you consider it a good thing when people want to use your application. However, when the application runs on a server, there&#x27;s a cost for popularity. With users come increased demands on resources, and at some point, you may find that you need to scale your app. One option is to throw more servers at the problem, establish a load balancer like Nginx, and let the demand sort itself out.

                    <span>彩蛋
今天看源码，无意间看到了一个谷歌工程师留下的小彩蛋。
LayoutInflater的tryCreateView方法
如果XML里定义的标签  name &#x3D; TAG_1995，直接就开派对了？？？

具体就是new了一个BlinkLayout，这个闪烁布局又是干啥的呢？
1.在onAttachedToWindow（页面可见）的时候，用handler发了一个延迟500ms的消息。

2.在onDetachedFromWindow（页面不可见）的时候，移除这个注册的handler，结束死循环。

3.在handleMessage处理消息的时候，将mBlinkState这个boolean值，取反mBlinkState &#x3D; !mBlinkState。然后在刷新页面dispatchDraw的时候，判断mBlinkState是否绘制页面。

                    <span>希望本文可以带给大家一个相对全局的视角看待卡顿问题，认识到卡顿是什么、卡顿的成因、卡顿的分类、卡顿的优化和一些经验积累，有的放矢地解决 App 流畅性问题。接下来会从以下五个方面进行讲述：
✦什么是卡顿
✦为什么会发生卡顿
✦如何评价卡顿
✦如何优化卡顿
✦加入我们
1. 什么是卡顿
卡顿，顾名思义就是用户体感界面不流畅。我们知道手机的屏幕画面是按照一定频率来刷新的，理论上讲，24 帧的画面更新就能让人眼感觉是连贯的。但是实际上，这个只是针对普通的视频而言。对于一些强交互或者较为敏感的场景来说，比如游戏，起码需要 60 帧，30 帧的游戏会让人感觉不适；位移或者大幅度动画 30 帧会有明显顿挫感；跟手动画如果能到 90 帧甚至 120 帧，会让人感觉十分细腻，这也是近来厂商主打高刷牌的原因。
对于用户来说，从体感角度大致可以将卡顿分为以下几类：

这些体验对于用户可以说是非常糟糕的，甚至会引起感官的烦躁，进而导致用户不愿意继续停留在我们的 App。可以说，流畅的体验对于用户来说至关重要。
2. 为什么会发生卡顿
用户体感的卡顿问题原因很多，且常常是一个复合型的问题，为了聚焦，这里暂只考虑真正意义上的掉帧卡顿。
2.1 绕不开的 VSYNC
我们通常会说，屏幕的刷新率是 60 帧，需要在 16ms 内做完所有的操作才不会造成卡顿。但是这里需要明确几个基本问题：
为什么是 16ms？
16ms 内都需要完成什么？
系统如何尽力保证任务在 16ms 内完成？
16ms 内没有完成，一定会造成卡顿吗？
这里先回答第一个问题：为什么是 16ms。早期的 Android 是没有 vsync 机制的，CPU 和 GPU 的配合也比较混乱，这也造成著名的 tearing 问题，即 CPU/GPU 直接更新正在显示的屏幕 buffer 造成画面撕裂。后续 Android 引入了双缓冲机制，但…</span>

                    <span>先进 简洁 安全。
在语法表现上，Kotlin够简洁明了。不防看看：你应该切换到Kotlin开发，它包含了零默认值和不可变性的安全特性，使你的Android应用程序在默认情况下是安全的 并且性能是良好的。
代码更安全
编写更安全的代码，并在应用程序中避免 发生Nullpointerexception。
var output: String
output &#x3D; null   // Compilation error&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;val name: String? &#x3D; null    // Nullable type
println(name.length())      // Compilation error 

语法更易读和简洁
Data Classes
更加专注于表达你自己的代码创意设计，无需编写更多的样板代码。
// Create a POJO with getters, setters, equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and copy() with a single line:
data class User(val name: String, val email: String)         

Lambdas语法
使用lambda来简化你的代码。
button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
   @Override
   public void onClick(View v){
       doSomething();
   }
});          

button.setOnClickListener { doSomething() }

日常开发中，你是否遇到过一些重复、模板性的代码，比如，数据模型的 fromJson/toJson 方法、或者统计每一个方法的执行时间。这一类代码没有什么难度且琐碎，导致我们加班，不能愉快的摸鱼。好消息是，Flutter 中也有类似原生 APT 和 AOP 的技术。他们有什么特点？该使用何种方案？它们是如何生成代码？且往下看
一、什么是 APT 和 AOP
1、APT（Annotation Processing Tool）注解处理工具
Flutter 中的 APT 一般指 source_gen，通过自定义的注解与处理程序，在 代码编辑阶段 生成对应可见的代码。
基于此的应用 比如：json_serializable，这是一个很好用的 json 解析代码库，通过给 model 添加 @JsonClass 注解，可以自动为我们生成对应的 fromJson/toJson 方法，并且支持属性别名以及复杂的 List 结构。例如：
源代码：
@JsonClass()
class CityModel {
  @JsonField([&quot;cityCode&quot;])
  String cityCode;
  @JsonField([&quot;cityName&quot;])
  String cityName;
  
  CityModel();
  
  factory CityModel.fromJson(Map json) {
    return _$CityModelFromJson(json);
  }
  Map toJson() {
    return _$CityModelToJson(this);
  }
}

                    <span>在使用新私有化部署的书签导航应用一个月之后，我们来聊聊书签导航工具，以及介绍如何使用 Docker 在几分钟之内部署属于你自己的书签导航应用。
写在前面
我目前使用的书签导航工具的界面是这样的（马赛克掉了一部分链接内容）：
我当前使用的书签导航工具界面
作为一个使用了十多年 Chrome 的用户，Chrome 书签管理器一直是我的主要的书签管理工具。在漫长的岁月里，我的 Chrome 书签管理器中，最多的时候存放了上千个书签链接。
但是 Chrome 的书签栏面积十分有限，随着折腾的东西越来越多，导致导航栏基本放不了多少东西，许多书签常常需要在书签二级目录甚至三级目录中查找，非常麻烦。当然，Chrome 地址栏和搜索栏二合一之后，浏览器支持从这个全能文本框中搜索某个书签以及历史搜索结果，但是在缺少提示的情况下，也时常出现 “茫茫人海，不知从何搜起”的状况，或者出现搜索结果中的书签会混杂在一堆历史浏览记录中的状况。
几个月前，我开始进行个人 PKM 重建。在过程中，我期待有更好的方式来使用书签，让我能够更多的使用“一次点击”来解决问题，减少大量翻箱倒柜式的“翻找”和“搜索”动作；同时，我也希望这些书签内容，可以在不同的浏览器和设备中共享，而不是仅限在 Chrome、Safari 或某个特定的产品中使用、甚至仅限在桌面浏览器环境中使用；我希望尽可能不使用在线的云服务，因为在过去的十年中，非常多的以云收藏夹为主营业务的公司都折戟在了互联网长河中；最后，我希望这些数据是能够使用比较友好的格式被妥善的存储，在未来某个时刻能够很方便的迁移到更先进的工具中。
基于上面的种种考虑，我在一众开源软件中找到了 Flame，在使用了一段时间后，我觉得 Flame 中的一些设计对于我而言比较多余，以及软件本身的性能效率并不是特别好，尤其是针对我这种拥有非常多书签的用户而言。所以，在借鉴 Flame…</span>

                    <span>用 Vim 编辑中文时，有两个独有的小问题：输入法切换；中文文章中光标跳转。
输入法切换
在插入模式和普通模式之间切换时，应该分别对应中文输入法和英文输入法（或中文输入法的英文状态）。
Vim 需要在两种模式之间频繁切换，每次都要切换输入法状态会产生干扰，打断心流。
解决方案有两个思路：输入法级的方案，和 Vim 级的方案。
1. 输入法级的方案
一些输入法提供了在特定软件中使用特定输入法的设置，例如搜狗拼音。但是它似乎没办法识别当前是在 Vim 的哪一种模式下。
开源输入法引擎中州韵（在 Mac 上叫&quot;鼠须管&quot;, 在 Windows 上叫&quot;小狼毫&quot;) 提供了更细的控制：它有个叫 vim_mode 的开关，可以根据 Vim 的所在模式自动切换。在 squirrel.custom.yaml 中配置即可。
app_options:
    org.vim.MacVim:
        ascii_punct: true
        vim_mode: true
    vim:
        ascii_punct: true
        vim_mode: true
在这个配置里，除了打开 vim_mode 的开关外，还设置了在 Vim 或 MacVim 中使用英文标点。这在写代码时很好用，能避免用错标点导致的错误。在写中文文章时，可以用 Pangu 之类的插件自动处理一下就好了。
2. Vim 级的方案
也可以完全不考虑输入法，让插件来改变输入法状态。有一个叫 smart-im 的插件，可以很好地实现这一功能。
中文文章跳转
写英文或代码时，w 和 W 是常用的跳转方式。但是中文不用空格来分词，所以 w 会以逗号和句号为分隔符来跳转；如果使用的是中文标点，情况就更糟。
这个问题难以解决；它是个自然语言处理问题，得让计算机稍微懂一点中文才行。
要稍微迂回地解决这个…</span>

终于到了要正式介绍这部作品的时候了，一款开放世界 ARPG 游戏，由 FromSoftware 负责开发，「魂」系列游戏制作人宫崎英高、以《冰与火之歌（A Song of Ice and Fire）》等作品闻名的小说家乔治·R·R·马丁（George Raymond Richard Martin）联合创作了游戏世界观，从《只狼：影逝二度（Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice）》时代有传闻开始，就一直受到「魂」类游戏粉丝追捧、引起媒体与玩家社群广泛关注。
和《黑暗之魂（Dark Souls）》等同门的「魂」系列作品类似的是，本作依然是由玩家自创角色游玩，而动作部分的体验不光整体继承了「魂」的风味，还扩充了骑马作战、魔法技能两大方面；而与「魂」大相径庭的是，《艾尔登法环》改弦更张为开放世界式的地图设计，串联各个「迷宫」的不再是一条条线性通路，而是分布着自然景观、聚落、谜题等的旷野，供玩家自由穿行。
最后分享一点纯个人的《艾尔登法环》网络测试玩后感：从观感上讲，本作在「魂」的中世纪剑与魔法风格基础上有所升华，而且执行得挺不错，从初始地洞爬出、第一次亲眼见到…</span>

                    <span>书接 上回，我在 2021 年保持了文中提到的绝大多数好习惯，这些习惯也继续使我受益匪浅。然而，其中一个习惯在 2021 年悄然发生了变化。在前文中，我提到自己「在且慢、蛋卷基金上挑选了两个主理人，跟着他们的策略无脑跟投，不用盯盘，不用担心市场的大波动。」我不是全盘否定这个做法，只是在差不多半年的时间过去后，意识到自己其实可以做得更好。经过了 2021 年的不断试错和学习，我想借这次年度征文的机会和大家聊聊——如何从一个只会「迷信权威」的小白，成长为一个可以「独立思考」的投资者。
投资是一门艺术，艺术没有权威
就像梵高可以批评我的画不好看但不能批评我画得不正确一样，没有人可以批评任何一个合法合规的获利行为是错误的。不管是价值投资还是成长风格，不管是低买高卖还是追涨杀跌，只要能够持续地获得可观的收益率，我认为就是成功的投资方法。
在数学中 1+1 一定等于 2，在化学中水分子一定是由氢和氧两种元素组成，在物理中地球表面的重力加速度一定近似于9.8m/s2，但在投资领域，很少有公认百分之百正确的知识是建立在科学的基础上，就像没有人可以预测未来一周的纳斯达克指数趋势，也没有可以告诉你买什么股票一定会挣钱。如果说在投资领域一定有什么值得学习的科学知识，那么我认为初中水平的数学和大学本科水平的宏观经济已经足矣，如果再懂一点财务和会计知识就是锦上添花了。
巴菲特曾说过「如果我所有的资金只能买入一家企业的股票，我会全部买成富国银行。」2016年，富国银行爆出 5000 多人参与账户造假的丑闻。巴菲特在 1989 年建仓，在 2019 年之后将大部分股份卖出，历经 30 年收益率不足 110%，几乎可以称得上一笔失败的投资。连股神巴菲特都会犯错，并且不止一次犯错，试问投资界还有哪个「权威人士」值得你去盲目崇拜呢？
那么，这些投资界的「权威人士」难道就一无是处了吗？自然不是，投资是一门艺术，…</span>

                    <span>前几年物品断舍离的概念很火，人们也开始逐渐意识到，需要扔掉的不止是已经损坏的东西，那些之后再也用不到的，其实也都可以清理出自我空间。物理空间的清理完成了，是不是自我成长空间的一些情感也该进行类似的定夺呢？
2021 年疫情之下大家肯定也没有少经历什么，比如我终于下定决心，结束了一份自耗极大的四年多恋爱状态。当然这篇文章不是在抱怨或者反思什么，而是想从经历的恋爱过程中，去总结一些同样适用于日常生活人际交往或者自我成长方面的感悟。
谈恋爱或许不只彼此感受幸福体验酸甜苦辣，能从谈恋爱的过程中得到成长我觉得也是更有意义的。
对外：人际关系中也需要一些「辣」
我觉得谈恋爱也是在锻炼人与人之间的相处关系磨合，或许比普通朋友之间的摩擦更大，但是确实能体会和经历更多不同类型的生活细节。
沟通永远是最高效的处理方式
不管是什么感情类型，爱情、友情、亲情等等其实都需要沟通。这种沟通不是说日常的面对面交流说话，而是当有问题有矛盾出现时，能彼此面对面就事论事地进行想法交流，通过交换彼此当下的想法来进行问题或矛盾解决。
原生家庭的原因，因为母亲的强势可能导致我从小在自我情绪表达上更偏向于「委屈自己咽」，而不是去说出口。
所以在恋爱过程中，很多时候可能对方一些不经意间的做法让我觉得难过时，我都不会去主动表达出来，甚至还会觉得是自己太敏感想太多，然后劝诫自己少「无理取闹」。
蔡康永有说过一句话：你最好努力表达，因为别人没有义务要理解你。你有什么需求，想让别人知道你要好好的表达出来，别让别人来猜。
就像那副熟悉的场景画面：「你生气了吗？」「没有」；「我哪里做错了啊？」「你没错，是我错了行不行」。这些日常传播于互联网的前提其实就是双方没有表达清楚彼此的诉求和前因后果，导致在后续的口舌交战中，双方都懒得再进行细节上的沟通，索性直接冷战或者不了了之。
这种情况造成的后果就是：问题没有解决（甚至堆积）、影响彼此心…</span>

2022 年 2 月 4 日，「新冠疫情爆发后首届如期举办的奥运会」——北京 2022 年冬奥会（大名：「第 24 届冬季奥林匹克运动会」英文「XXIV Olympics Winter Games Beijing 2022」，简称「北京冬奥会」）在「鸟巢」（国家体育场）正式拉开帷幕。春节期间，应该也有不少读者通过电视和网络直播「围观」过开幕式和国家体育场主火炬塔点燃的瞬间。
为了帮助你更好地观看北京冬奥会的比赛，这份包含观赛平台、赛程表等的冬奥观赛补给包特地为你准备好，为你的冬奥观赛助一臂之力。
这届冬奥会到底在哪里举办？
虽说是「北京冬奥会」，但实际上是由北京市联手河北省张家口市，由北京赛区、延庆赛区和张家口赛区共三个赛区共同举办 。北京赛区主管速度滑冰、短道速滑、冰壶、冰球、花样滑冰等冰上项目以及单板和自由式滑雪大跳台等雪上项目；延庆赛区举办高山滑雪、雪橇、雪车和钢架雪车四个分项；张家口赛区则承办冬季两项、越野滑雪等雪上项目。
你知道上面的小图标代表哪些场馆吗？
闭环管理是啥？
由于疫情原因，北京冬奥组委决定对运动员、随队官员和其他利益方人员（包括志愿者、记者等）进行闭环管理。闭环管理就是境外来华的人员，从入境进入海关后开始体温筛查，经过核酸采样，然后直接通过专用的交通工具送到奥运村或签约酒店。每个奥运村和签约酒店，都是一个独立的闭环。从入境到抵离，交通、餐饮、住宿、训练、比赛，包括媒体的采访，形成了多个闭环点，通过交通工具在这些闭环点连线移动进行活动和工作，就是一个完整的闭环。这样做可以有效避免闭环外人员被可能的病例感染。

前言
相信各位身处异乡的同学一定会被父母抱怨过家里的网络或者电脑问题，也时不时打开诸如  FaceTime 或者微信视频之类的软件帮助父母远程解决问题。现在国内网络基建发展迅速，几乎做到了 FTTH（光纤入户），但是很多老房子的配套网络硬件都很古老，新房子开发商也会留下很多暗坑。而各大运营商的宽带服务也只解决到光猫端。所以老家的网络一直是我们这些在外漂泊折腾人的心头大痛。
当然每家每户的情况都很不一样，本文我就以我老家三次网络结构调整的一些经验和问题为主，详细讲讲怎么让家中的老人用上舒心的网络。
正文
我家是一个二〇一〇年代中后期的房子，在交房之初国内还处于百兆宽带普及的阶段，因此家庭的基础网络布线还是不错的——做到了 Cat.5e 线布到每个房间，这为之后铺设良好网络建立的良好的条件。但是开发商仍然留了不少暗坑给我，下面让我们先整理一下最开始的网络拓扑结构。
拓扑梳理
最开始我们先看看我家的的结构图以及弱电箱
家中的户型，以及网口分布图
可以看的出几个主要活动的区域的网口覆盖还是相当到位的，但是弱电箱在走廊中间的储物柜中且只有一点点大，塞满了设备的弱电箱简直惨不忍睹：
开发商留下的弱电箱
让我们梳理一下弱电箱中的各个部分和模块的功能：

GPON 光猫：负责光纤入户以及播号，同时需要供给电话信号。
百兆交换机模块两个：负责全屋网络交换，共计两个 12 根网线。
电话线交换模块：负责电话信号拨入以及分发。
有线电视分配器：负责分配有线电视信号。
电源：负责供给弱电箱中的电能。
数字电视线：负责电视盒子（类似 IPTV）的数字接入，…</span>

写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢 「用产品思维解构生活」 的花生酱，也可以叫我 Jeff。
我至今正式写作了 6 年，看上去是蛮不错的坚持成果，但老实说，最近 1 年我才开始喜欢自己的文章，也是在最近 1 年，我才找到自己「高效产出文章」的效率写作之道。
效率写作是个复杂的旅途，途中险象环生。
缺乏灵感和选题会让我们放弃，自说自话会让我们找不到读者，拾人牙慧会让我们迷失自我。这些复杂的难题，每一个都足够成为效率杀手，吞没我们的写作生涯。我也是花了5年时间，才逐一和解，摸索到我今日能安于写作的状态�。
所以，我试图用这篇文章探讨：谈及写作，我们如何从入门、坚持再到高效。
希望诸君无需 5 年弯路，都能找到自己的效率写作之道。
粗放写作的利与弊
2022 年 1 月我的少数派数据
2016 年的我，从未想过自己能有幸发表文章被几万人阅读。
彼时，我带着不屑与傲慢开始写作，尝试去解答一些诸如「产品经理能力模型」的宏大命题。结果是，我被社区拒稿了 4 次，进而，巨大的恐慌和质疑包围着我。当时被拒绝的原因诸如：

文章结构不符合金字塔思维；
内容不够深度...

但我都不能完全地理解、修正，甚至自己完全看不出问题。
这种不理解，进一步引发了自我怀疑。
每天我都在想，我是不是不适合写作，我写的东西是不是太啰嗦了，或许我当前的能力不足以写产品话题，我该沉淀两年再等等？但对于这些问题，我并没有能力第一时间找到答案---否则就不会被拒绝 4 次了。
总之，我带着诸多疑问和拙劣…</span>

Google Chrome 更换应用图标
2 月 5 日，Elvin 在推特公布，Google 目前已在 Chrome Canary 版本中启用了全新的应用图标。本次的图标更新是继 2014 年以来第一次图标变动，跟 2014 年版本图标相比，新图标除去了阴影效果，并调节了图形比例和色彩，并采用更精确的渐变设计。来源

                    <span>今天，紫川动画第九集开播，猪期待已久的帝都流血夜剧情终于出来了。
    帝都流血夜是紫川第一部的高潮，也是三兄弟性格展现、人性冲突的一场剧，三人今后的道路和命运都在这一夜被决定了，可以说是紫川第一部里最重要的戏份了。
    因为故事激烈，猪当年是写得很舒畅的。感谢动画制作团队的用心，将这一幕剧情呈现得很符合猪心意，尤其是将总长参星的狠辣和阴险表现得很到位，将原作里一些遗漏和缺陷的情节也做了弥补，猪很是满意，中午和猪老婆一起美滋滋地看了动画，感觉甚是意得志满。
     但孔圣人是怎么说的？天下唯女人难缠也！不学无术的猪老婆甚是可恶，看完以后居然大发厥辞，说动画很精彩，但原作写得太粗糙简单，破绽太多！
这蠢婆娘专门抬杠，差点把猪给气死。
猪婆娘蠢言论：“这场政变虎头蛇尾，这么简单就被平定了，杨明华是送死来的，他根本就一点胜算都没有，本就不应该发动这场叛乱的！”
猪：错！在杨明华看来，他的优势很大！
政变前，帝都的武装力量本来有三部分：中央军，是帝都最大也是最强的武装力量，足有十万兵马，军团长雷迅，是杨明华的亲信；禁卫军，约一万来人，负责总长府的保卫，是忠于总长的；另外还有负责城内秩序的总监察厅宪兵部队，人数也是数千人，是总监察长萧龙统带。至于其他的治部少治安警察在这里基本只有当观众的份了。
本来，总长紫川参星一直就是靠禁军和监察厅的宪兵，才勉强和掌握中央军的杨明华维持了一个危险的弱势平衡，但政变之前，总监察长萧龙被杨明华拉拢了过去，帝都城内局势陡然失衡，何况杨明华还召来了帝林统带的远东边军呢？在政变前的杨明华看来，自己掌握了帝都城内、城外的三大部队，对付只有万把人的禁军，那简直是飞龙骑脸想输都难，他不动手还等什么？
杨明华最大的错误，是没看破帝林是紫川参星安插的卧底，还让他统带了关键的远东边军进城，这导致了他最终的失败。
猪婆娘：“杨明华兵力本身足够，还画蛇添足叫帝林带兵回来干什么？他让中央军直接攻打总长府不就得了？”
猪：在雷迅统带下，中央军的政治立场是倾向于杨明华一方的，但他们毕竟也是紫川家的军官，要他们主动攻打紫川家的总长府跟禁军厮杀，同时还要背一个弑主的名声，大部分中央军军人是不会愿意的。
因为中央军和禁军的士兵都是大多出身帝都本地人，大家本乡本土，搞不好沾亲带故的，都是亲戚街坊邻居朋友，干这种造反、沾血又坏名声的事，动员起来是很有难度的。剧情里，紫川秀能稳住中央军不参与叛乱，一个很大的原因就是中央军的军官团本来就有置身事外的强烈意愿。
但是远东边军就不同了。边军跟帝都老百姓没交情，下得了狠手。在帝都干杀人放火的事他们是毫无压力的。在杨明华的原计划里，帝林带的远东军回来就是当刀子的，而帝都的中央军是用来压阵和事后收拾残局的，两支兵马互相制衡。没料到事与愿违，帝林这把刀子却是捅向了他自己。
猪婆娘蠢言论：“既然杨明华优势很巨大，他为什么不趁早篡位，要拖那么久？”
猪：杨明华在帝都城内确实占尽优势，但他一直不敢篡位，主要障碍倒不是总长府里的那万把禁卫军，而是另外两个原因。
一是元老院。后面的三杰之乱里我们就看到，一个得不到元老会承认和支持的叛逆者，即使能攻下总长府杀了总长，他的处境也会非常艰难的。作为一个老谋深算的政治家，杨明华不能不考虑到后果。
二是驻守各地的带兵统领，像哥应星、明辉、方劲等人。紫川参星虽然暗弱，但他毕竟还是紫川家明面上的主君，他被弑杀的消息传出去，统领们做出什么反应是难以预估的。所以，杨明华必须要准备好应付他们的暗手以后才能动手。
也正是因为有着元老院和统领们的支持，紫川参星这个弱势总长才能对上强势的杨明华坚持那么多年。紫川参星和杨明华，他们二人之间有点像洪秀全和杨秀清，洪秀全拥有大势和名分，杨秀清则拥有实力上的优势。二人之间的斗争，谁赢都有可能，胜负也只是一线，不能说哪一方是压倒性优势或者毫无机会的。
辨了一个中午，最后，杠精猪老婆哑口无言，猪大获全胜，鼻孔朝天。
总之，对于这一集帝都流血夜，猪是很满意的~~感谢腾讯、铸梦工作室和万维猫动画的兄弟姐妹们，你们出色地复现了原作剧情，表达了猪的想法，让猪当年梦想的世界和故事得以活灵活现地呈现出来，与喜欢的读者们一同分享！

                    <span>“帝都流血夜”在原著《紫川》中，是一段非常重要且深刻的剧情，杨明华蛰伏多年，终于在认为自己有把握的时候露出了自己的獠牙。编剧在改编这段的时候和我们讨论了很久，他们建议能把杨明华的整条阴谋计划拉满，因为反派能力越强，才能显示主角们扭转乾坤的不易。[正义总能打倒邪恶.jpg] 
但那样会对原著进行大幅度改编，于是我们进行了反复推演，如果我们自己是杨明华， 手握这样一把好牌，我们应该怎么打？是强行夺权逼宫，不顾世人看法？ 还是会给自己扯一面大旗，把自己包装成正义之师？ 再或者……娶了紫川宁，毕竟没有血缘关系。[滑稽.jpg]
原著中曾经提到“杨明华实在是相貌堂堂——怎么看都象个正直可靠的长者！”但实则““卑鄙到——连把牙刷都不能交他保管！”，足以看出杨明华是一个道貌岸然的人，做事考虑的也会更周全，所以最终我们为他选择了“勤王”的招数：让明羽模仿紫川宁笔迹，再盖上她的私印→让紫川宁昭告天下紫川参星的“罪行”→杨明华带军队前来救驾→事成之后再找机会暗害掉无人保护的紫川宁→紫川家族再无后人，杨明华自然就能上位了。
而对于最大对手哥应星， 杨明华的计划是：派帝林去领远东军，分散哥应星势力→强行让帝林带远东军队回帝都→军官大会上帝林杀掉哥应星→为平公愤，杨明华“大义灭亲”处决&quot;刽子手”帝林。 杨明华算计了很多人，但是唯独忽略了紫川参星，这才酿造了自己的悲剧。[事后烟.jpg]
《紫川》是一部史诗题材作品，里面有很多战争权谋的戏份，为了还原这些，团队进行了很多细致的思考，希望能给到大家一部不一样的动画番剧。

                    <span>大家好，我是比利白。

上期我们聊了北京冬奥会的单板滑雪项目，今天我们来聊聊自由式滑雪项目，为了单板更好作区分，我更愿意称它为双板自由式滑雪。

不方便看视频的朋友，我也准备了图文内容：
自由式滑雪比赛
同为双板滑雪，自由式滑雪虽然在高山滑雪的基础上孕育发展而成，但进入冬奥会的时间却比高山滑雪项目要晚得多，直到1988年加拿大卡尔加里冬奥会上才作为表演项目出现，当时还有如今已经绝迹的雪上芭蕾项目。

自由式滑雪充满活力和观赏性，运动员通过冲击高难度动作来赢得高分，在空中展示灵活和敏捷性，这个项目中，许多运动员都有体操和蹦床的训练背景，比如05年出生的何金博就在13岁时从武术队跨项进入国家集训队，人称少林小子的他去年底解锁了倒滑Double Cork1800（空翻两周转体1800度），成了中国第一人。
何金博
1992年法国阿尔贝维尔冬奥会，雪上技巧正式被列为比赛项目。

我国在自由式滑雪项目上的冬奥成绩还不错，2006年的都灵冬奥会，韩晓鹏在空中技巧项目上拿下了中国冬奥会历史上获得的第一枚雪上项目金牌，至今中国凭借1金6银4铜共11枚奖牌位列自由式滑雪冬奥历史奖牌数量第四位，仅落后于美国加拿大和法国。
韩晓鹏
本次北京冬奥会，中国自由式滑雪将多点冲金，天才少女谷爱凌将参加自U型场地技巧、坡面障碍技巧和大跳台三个项目。
谷爱凌谷爱凌
而男子，女子和空中技巧混合团体项目上，名将贾宗洋，齐广璞，徐梦桃和孔凡钰也将向金牌发起冲击。
贾宗洋齐广璞徐梦桃孔凡钰
自由式滑雪比赛将于2月3日至19日在云顶滑雪公园和首钢滑雪大跳台两地举行。共设男女空中技巧、雪上技巧、障碍追逐、U型场地技巧、坡面障碍技巧和大跳台以及空中技巧混合团体共13个小项。共产生男、女各6人+1个团体总计13枚金牌。

从比赛规则来区分，除去障碍追逐比拼速度靠计时排名，其余五项均为技巧项目，依靠裁判打分。

                    <span>The problem:


You have a container under a docker-compose project, that you want to communicate or access another container which exists under a second docker-compose project
For some security policy, your SysOp or hosting provider blocks all external traffic, except those for port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS). However, you want to set up and manage several web (or non-web) services on your machine, basically using docker containers and managed by docker-compose.


To handle this you set-up a reverse-proxy using a dedicated docker-compose project and container, called proxy.


The proxy container/project listens on port 80, for all incoming external requests. (The nginx config can distinguish the called domain with the server_name directive)


On the other side, on another docker-compose…</span>

                    <span>Do you know TDD? I mean, do you REALLY know TDD?
I&#x27;m asking because even though this is a common acronym in today&#x27;s tech vocabulary, it&#x27;s still common to find people testing blindly(or even, not testing at all).
TDD is not a new technique, but today it is a must-have skill in development. For example, many jobs descriptions require this competency. So, if you want to understand TDD, this is the perfect article for you.
TDD is the acronym for Test-Driven Development. That means that you will write your code based on your tests.
Your tests come first.
This way, you can focus on how your code has to work and, most importantly, how it shouldn&#x27;t work. So doing the tests first helps you think about all the possibilities and avoid overengineering while coding.
Does this seem an impossible task? Y…</span>

This article provides a recipe for building fast look-up tables for huge CSV data sets in Python.
Look-up tables are meant to be read-only data structures used to search for a presence of a given key and to retrieve multiple values associated with existing keys. 
Recipe is meant to be a rough approach in contrast to a precise algorithm. 
Huge is relative and means significantly exceeding the amount of available RAM of a single machine, but comfortably fitting its storage.
Fast is subjective for a given use case and means quick enough to be used in stream processing or row-by-row batch processing.
The goal is achieved by calculating numeric representations of target keys, sorting and indexing the data set, doing binary se…</span>

iPhone as a phone is one with so many updates and changes brought in every time. Before the year 2022 and before the official release of the iPhone13, some leakages on information about iPhone 14 got out of the company.
No Notch and New Face ID Hardware Design








Body Design






As concerned with the design, the iPhone 14 is expected to look like iPhone 13. Some features like volume buttons of round shape and thickness unlike features like the size and quality of the material being made with will be updated.
There will be no 5.4-inch iPhone in 2022 because Apple is doing away with the &quot;mini&quot; line following lacklustre sales. The iPhone 13 mini will be the last of the mini phones and going forward, Apple is expected to focus on larger-sized iPhones.

From the Flutter site on the 3rd of February, a major update on flutter was made guess what it is? 
Windows and Flutter
Windows support arrives with Flutter 2.10 and in the coming months, you’ll hear more from Flutter on completing stable support for macOS and Linux, making the full set of desktop, web, and mobile platforms available for your production Flutter apps.
Performance improvements
This release of Flutter includes initial support for dirty region management provided by Flutter community member Knopp. He’s enabled partial repaints for a single dirty region on iOS/Metal. This change reduced 90th and 99th percentile rasterization times on a few benchmarks by an order of magnitude, and reduced GPU utilization on these benchma…</span>

                    <span>Hello, wonderful people of the internet and welcome to my first post in dev.to community.
Well, I and a couple of friends had in mind to build a bot to stay updated on the prices and upcoming releases of the sneakers. The biggest problem was finding the right API, but we managed to find a guy who did a huge job, put together: StockX FlightClub, Goat, and Stadium Goods API, cool right?
Sneaks-API by @druv5319
First create an application and a bot from here and in auth -&gt; general check bot and Administrator, save the bot token in the bot page.
Invite the bot in your discord server
git clone https://github.com/LucaArgentieri/Shoe-Discord-Bot.git

Run
npm i
Create a .env file and put bot token
BOT_TOKEN_KEY&#x3D;DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE

Run
npm run start
Use commands in chat! 🎉
This is the list of all commands at this moment. I&#x27;m here to show you and take new ideas for upgrading my bot.
$help For information on generic resell prices or based on the desired number.
$retail Yeezy(example) To get information about a shoe at retail.
$nextDrop To stay updated on upcoming releases.
$todayDrop To stay updated on the releases of the day.
$monthDrop To stay updated on the releases of the current month.
$infoShoesNumber Yeezy 11(example) To get information about a shoe with number.
$mostPopular To see the most popular scapre in the last three months.
This is a personal project that I use to learn, everyone is free to use it and can contribute to the code.
I let you the link to my repo and thank you for reading, see you in the next post.
Bye!</span>

                    <span>Since its release in 1994, the Design Patterns book continues to be a seminal work in building software. The book created a new shared vocabulary and named these repeated solutions we see all over different codebases. So much so there have been multiple other books on design patterns, documenting even more examples. You can quickly explain that your solution is an Adapter for anyone who has read about it without detailing what an Adapter is.
The material, as expected, isn&#x27;t without critique, Peter Novig wrote his analysis on how many of these patterns are unnecessary or replaceable by simpler constructs in dynamic languages. The book was written mainly using C++ (and some Smalltalk), focusing on covering what was available in C++, so dynamic languages change or remove the need for some of …</span>

                    <span>Wordle, the new online viral game everyone&#x27;s talking about, at first glance, seems to be not such a difficult feat for an average programmer.
In this post, I will be talking about a mistake that even experienced developers make when coding Wordle and how it can be fixed.
The rules of Wordle are straightforward:
Guess the secret word wihin 6 tries.
Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:
GREEN: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
YELLOW: The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
GRAY: The letter is not in the word in any spot.
So why are most hobbyists and even content creators such as Web Dev Simplified and Burke Holland from Visual Studio Code getting it wrong?*

                    <span>美国要替换华为和中兴设备，却没钱没设备

为替换华为和中兴的设备，美国联邦通信委员会的“安全可信通信补偿计划”为拥有 1000 万以下用户的运营商提供补偿，预算为 19 亿美元。然而在三个月的申请期间收到了 56 亿美元的申请，这就需要美国国会重新解决资金问题了。此外，除了 资金问题之外，准备提供替换设备的思科、Juniper 也不能及时提供设备产能，他们表示可能要 1-2 年的时间才能生产出来。


老王点评：如果真的有后门，这么长时间想做什么都做完了吧。




Meta 正考虑退出欧洲市场

伴随着《欧洲通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）的生效，美国的隐私保护法规被认为不符合规定。在欧盟法院的一项重要裁决之后，宣告欧盟-美国之间的有关个人数据的隐私盾协议无效。这一裁决影响到每一家美国公司，包括 Meta、谷歌、微软和亚马逊等。在近日提交的一份 SEC 文件中，Meta 说如果它不能与美国的业务、应用程序和数据中心分享欧洲用户的数据，将对其有针对性的在线广告能力产生破坏性影响，它或将干脆完全 撤出欧洲。


老王点评：或许广告盈利模式会有一些新的变化和博弈，但是我想本质上不会变，用户获得免费服务的代价总是以某种形式支付。




AI 已经威胁到有声书行业的从业者

与 传统的人工配音 相比，AI 配音的有声书成本要低得多。但是将失去工作的不仅仅是配音员，而是整个有声书配音生态。根据美国音频出版商协会的最新数据，美国 2020 年出版的有声书超过 7.1 万本，但只占当年出版的印刷书籍数量的一小部分。专业的配音员认为自己所从事的是艺术，然而这并不能阻止出版商越来越多的采用 AI 来配音。


老王点评：和很多即将被 AI 取代的工作一样，我觉得与其抱怨和反对，倒不如想想如何让 AI 更好的配音，重新定位自己的角色。</span>

                    <span>Falkon 的最新版本带来了截屏功能和基于 PDFium 的 PDF 阅读器以及其他改进。




如果你是 KDE 的粉丝，你肯定接触过，甚至使用过 Falkon。所以，你一定会惊喜地发现，KDE 已经成功地为他们的网络浏览器发布了新的重大升级。

与其他主流网络浏览器不同，Falkon 的更新并不频繁。这个最新发布的版本是一个令人兴奋的更新，在间隔了近三年之后！

补充一句，Falkon 是一个建立在 QtWebEngine 上的简单的开源网络浏览器。它最初被称为 QupZilla，后来在 KDE 旗下被重新命名为 Falkon。

虽然并不是新浏览器，它早在 2010 年就发布了，但它为普通用户提供了一种极简的浏览体验。



Falkon 3.2.0 有什么新内容？

即使你现在安装的是最新版本，Falkon 也没有定期提供安全更新。

因此，你可以考虑将 Falkon 作为满足特定要求的浏览器或作为辅助浏览器。

下面是这个版本的新内容：

截屏和 PDF 阅读器支持

最新的版本带来了急需的截屏功能和可选的基于 PDFium 的 PDF 阅读器。这两个都是基于 Qt 5.13 的版本。

主题和插件

对下载主题和扩展的初步支持也被添加进来了，同时偏好菜单也显示了对 KDE 商店的链接。此外，用户现在也可以删除本地安装的主题和插件。



书签

由于有了上下文菜单项，用户现在可以创建文件夹并存储书签。人们已经注意到，填充书签栏和创建顶级的书签的能力已经没有了。

其他功能


在 Falkon 中添加的一个非常常见但又必不可少的功能是暂停或恢复下载的能力。

更新的 CookieManager 现在允许同时选择一个以上的 cookie。

首选项扩展现在可以筛选查找。

用户现在可以通过上下文菜单分离标签。

现在包括 NetworkManager 集成。


要了解更多关于所有的技术变化，你可以参考 官方发布说明。



总结

Falkon 的最新版本表明 KDE 仍然计划继续支持它。这对 KDE 爱好者来说是个好消息，特别是对那些使用 Falkon 的人来说。但是，现在说他们是否计划定期推送更新，使其成为日常浏览的理想选择，还为时过早。

如果你觉得一个简单的、轻量级的网络浏览器就可以，而且有很好的广告屏蔽功能，一个与 KDE 桌面融合的浏览器，Falkon 是一个必须尝试的东西。

安装是非常直接的。你可以在你的软件库中找到它，或者使用 Flatpak 或 Snap 包 安装它。如果你想知道，它也可用于 Windows 用户。

                    <span>提供一个适当的 CMake 配置文件来使其他人可以更容易地构建、使用和贡献你的项目。




这篇文章是使用开源 DevOps 工具进行 C/C++ 开发系列文章的一部分。如果你从一开始就把你的项目建立在一个功能强大的工具链上，你的开发会更快和更安全。除此之外，这会使别人更容易地参与你的项目。在这篇文章中，我将搭建一个基于 CMake 和 VSCodium 的 C/C++ 构建系统。像往常一样，相关的示例代码可以在 GitHub 上找到。

我已经测试了在本文中描述的步骤。这是一种适用于所有平台的解决方案。

为什么用 CMake ？

CMake 是一个构建系统生成器，可以为你的项目创建 Makefile。乍一看简单的东西可能相当地复杂。在较高的层次上，你可以定义你的项目的各个部分（可执行文件、库）、编译选项（C/C++ 标准、优化、架构）、依赖关系项（头文件、库），和文件级的项目结构。CMake 使用的这些信息可以在文件 CMakeLists.txt 中获取，它使用一种特殊的描述性语言编写。当 CMake 处理这个文件时，它将自动地侦测在你的系统上已安装的编译器，并创建一个用于启动它的 Makefile 文件。

此外，在 CMakeLists.txt 中描述的配置，能够被很多编辑器读取，像 QtCreator、VSCodium/VSCode 或 Visual Studio 。

示例程序

我们的示例程序是一个简单的命令行工具：它接受一个整数来作为参数，输出一个从 1 到所提供输入值的范围内的随机排列的数字。

$ ./Producer 10
3 8 2 7 9 1 5 10 6 4 


在我们的可执行文件中的 main() 函数，我们只处理输入的参数，如果没有提供一个值（或者一个不能被处理的值）的话，就退出程序。

相信大家已经都在对 Flutter 2.10 版本跃跃欲试，本篇就目前升级用 Flutter 2.10 版本遇到的问题做一些总结提炼。
事实上按照 Flutter 每个版本的投入使用规律，应该是第三个小版本最稳，以 Flutter 目前庞大的用户量，每次正式版的发布必然带来各种奇奇怪怪的问题，一般情况下我推荐 2.10 版本等到 2.10.3 发布再投入生产会更稳妥，但是如果你等不及官方 hotfix ，那么后面的内容可能可以帮助到你。
本次如果你是从 2.8 升级的到 2.10 ，那么 dart 层需要调整几乎等于零。
Kotlin 版本
首先就项目升级的第一个，也就是最重要的一个，就是升级你的 kotlin 插件版本，这个是强制的，因为之前的旧版本使用的基本都是 1.3.x 的版本，而这些 Flutter 2.10 强制要求 1.5.31 以上的版本。
buildscript {
-    ext.kotlin_version &#x3D; &#x27;1.3.50&#x27;
+    ext.kotlin_version &#x3D; &#x27;1.5.31&#x27;

这里需要注意，这次升级 Kotlin 版本，会带来一些 Kotlin 包的 API 出现一些 break 的变化 ，所以如果你本身 App 使用了较多 Kotlin 开发，或者插件里使用了一些 Kotlin 的包，就需要注意升级带来的适配成本，例如：
ProducerScope 需要 override 新的 trySend 方法，但是这个方法需要 return 一个 ChannelResult ， ChannelResult 是  @InternalCoroutinesApi 。
Gradle 版本
因为 Kotlin 版本升级了，所以 AGP 插件必须使用最低 4.0.0 配合 Gradle 6.1.1 的版本，也就是…</span>

                    <span>一、前言
当我们点击手机桌面上的应用图标，到手机桌面显示出应用主Activity界面而完成应用启动，看似很简单的过程其实包含了复杂的底层交互。整个启动过程，涉及了Android系统的很多核心知识点。
二、启动过程简介
首先，手机桌面就是一个APP应用，名称叫Launcher，是手机厂商提供的，不同的手机厂商开发出了一套自己UI风格的展示桌面。我们点击Launcher桌面的APP应用图标，可以打开其他的APP应用。
APP应用的启动过程，分为冷启动和热启动两种。
冷启动：APP应用进程未启动，系统会fork出一个子进程来加载APP应用的Application并启动Activity，这种启动方式就是冷启动。
热启动：APP应用进程已启动，已在后台运行。系统的所有工作就是将APP应用的 Activity 带到前台展示。
冷启动是应用完全从0开始启动，涉及到更多的内容，所以我们就从APP应用的冷启动过程展开讨论。
三、启动过程分析
一般来说，冷启动包括以下几个步骤：
启动APP进程：当我们点击Launcher桌面程序的APP图标时，Launcher程序会调用startActivity()函数，通过Binder跨进程通信，发送消息给system_server进程。在system_server进程中，由AMS通过socket通信告知Zygote进程fork出一个子进程(APP进程)。
开启APP主线程：APP进程启动后，会实例化一个ActivityThread，并执行其main函数，同时会创建ApplicationThread、Looper、Handler对象，开启主线程消息循环Looper.loop()。
创建并初始化Application和Activity：ActivityThread的main函数通过调用attach方法进行 Binder 通信，通知system_server进程…</span>

                    <span>冰墩墩好可爱啊！！！
虽然建模的过程很墨迹很痛苦，软件用的不是很熟练导致中间卡壳的地方很多，不过建出来之后的成就感还是无可比拟的！
做的模型与真正的冰墩墩还是有很大出入的，所以我管自己做的这个叫“冰汤圆”，因为它比冰墩墩更圆一些~
祝大家早日实现一人一墩！！！
（模型就不公开啦，不能侵犯版权，而且整个模型也是打印不出来的，很多结构只是视觉效果~）

“字节跳动 50 亿元收购 pico，宣布进军元宇宙”

这成为了同事，会不会给点优惠啊，翠翠这么想着，结果就有了内部员工福利 —— 原来 2599 的 Pico Neo 3 只要 1599，甚至到手写写测评还有金币～
本来就想着买买 VR 设备玩玩，坐对面的同事更是早就买了在持续打卡。这一手 50% off 简直就是打瞌睡遇枕头（浪费我钱财，Pico 你坏事做尽），买买买！
开箱
幸亏买的早 hhh 在 12 月底知道这个活动的时候就买了，随着折扣消息越传越开，周围同事纷纷加入抢购大军。据说隔壁组 Pico 覆盖率已经到 40% 了（笑哭）然后不出所料的在 刚在活动正式开始的十天内就断货了。
在此之前，我对 VR 的印象还停留在某年舍友送的生日礼物，当然造价也不是很高，也因此体验也相对比较一般，而且还是那种需要插入手机的，就导致每次安装都很麻烦，自然也就吃灰了。也不知道过了四五年，这个行业现在怎样。
受到盒子的时候感觉还是比较惊喜的，简洁感和科技感上来了 hhh 长这个样子

拆开康康～里面有一个主机和两个控制器

翠翠本人就不出镜了，给傻 fufu 套上让她试一试～

上手体验
硬件
没接触过 VR 设备的小伙伴，可能心里会有不少的疑问：

重不重，戴上会不会很累
戴眼镜还能用设备咩
会不会晕 3D

刚刚收到货的时候，俺也一样忐忑。不过收到硬件的时候还是挺惊喜的，上面担心的几点看起来都不是什么问题。
首先，重量控制得比较合适，而且后面有对应可以卡住的配重块，也就使得整个机器戴上后不会头重脚轻。
其次，并不会卡住眼镜，即使戴着眼镜再戴 VR，也比较舒适，眼镜会卡在大概这个位置。

而且一般情况，不是剧烈运动很长时间的时候也不会有眩晕感 —— 当然，如果一直戴一直打剧烈的运动，翠翠还是会有点点晕的，不过这个也因人而异吧。
但是有一个很有…</span>

                    <span>初见
我对电子墨水屏有初次认知是在初中的时候。那时，家里要换电器，就带上我一起去了苏宁电器。Kindle 的商铺就在入口不远处，一进门就能看见。
销售人员和我妈说了一堆话术，而我专注地把玩眼前的阅读器，只听见一句「最适合爱读书的人。」或许因为这句话，又或许是觉得能够省下一些实体书的钱，我妈才下定决心买给我。我一直不知道这款设备的型号——后来才知道是 Kindle PaperWhite 3——只知道这类设备有一个统称的名字：电纸书。
我确实用它看了不少书，比如《冰与火之歌》全套。这种设备，三年五年都不带坏的，加上我那时候信息闭塞，也就没有一直关注。直至 2018 年（我有了自己的电脑），我才在 TESTV 的一期节目中看到这种大屏的 E-Ink 设备。
看到它的第一眼，我觉得这就是我梦寐以求的设备啊！阅读 + 书写，完美。我把这个牌子记在心里，寻思出国我一定买一台。
（关于第一代的更多信息，你可以看@青雪唐元的这篇文章）
截自官方宣传片
2019 年到了美国之后，搜了官网，看了价格，觉得再考虑考虑，就在 Instagram 上关注了官方账号，接着忙学业去了。2020 年的某一天，我看到官方发布了第二代的宣传片：Next Generation Paper Tablet。我彻底心动了（请原谅我用自己翻译的视频）：
 
我赶紧去官网看了产品介绍，立刻预购了。
因为是预售，$399 包含本机 + 基础笔 + 基础保护套：
来自官网
我加钱换购了灰色编织的 Book Folio，总共是 $470，但现在已然不是这个价格了：

本以为能够像官方说的在五月份拿到，结果因为疫情和港口等原因，硬是生生拖到了十月下旬，让我整整等了七个月。

                    <span>我与iHOUR的结缘说来也很简单，在尝试使用打卡软件以形成自律人生的道路上愈挫愈无望，干脆转换思路，想知道我荒废的时间以什么样的方式流失，所以寻找了一款订购价格合理、设计简洁美观的时间记录软件。
在使用了一个月后，我在下面这篇文章中讲述了使用iHour进行时间记录与管理的起因、经过与结果，这篇关于iHour的文章也成为我加入少数派的敲门砖。
 
也许是与iHour注定的契合，文章中提到的一些我基于iHour原有功能自创的用法，竟然在此后的一次版本大更新（3.2.1版本）中成为了新增功能，进一步增加了实用性与个性化，我也更加坚定了长期使用iHour的决心。也要感谢少数派的文章作为载体，保留了之前版本的使用记录和截图，能够使得我将3.2.1版本前后作为对比，从使用30天到使用300天+，更为直观地记录我与iHour的一同成长。
版本迭代回顾：什么变了？
时间类别
在进行对比之前，我还是需要重申为什么把时间进行分类很有必要：这会让你在开始做一件事情前，会因为需要选择一个类别开始计时而被迫思考你做个事情的意义，这一点其实和B站的@老师好我叫何同学 在【这视频能让你戒手机】视频里的时间锁设计逻辑上不谋而合，想清楚你为什么要做这个事情，是做事情最高效的方式。对于我来说，可能用正向计时并记录的方式会更加直观和易于开始，倒计时限制时长反而增加了门槛。另外，做什么都有即时回馈是最理想的状态，最简单的实现方式就是，开始时带着目的，结束时记录时间。
在3.2.1版本前，每个时间类别是独立存在的，我会特意将学习工作类的图标选择蓝色系、悠闲类选择粉色系、琐碎放空类选择绿色，使得这些独立存在的时间投入能在最后呈现的饼状图上形成整体、有所区分（可参考下一小节配图）；而这一点在3.2.1版本中，被应用为支持总分类和子分类，比如在｛工作与学习｝大类下设｛数据分析｝｛论文写作｝｛阅读书籍｝等子分类。

啫喱：元宇宙版「微信」上线？

平台：iOS
关键词：虚拟社交、通讯、虚拟形象

@Snow：如果要盘一盘这两个月最火热的应用，《啫喱》绝对算得上其中之一，乘着「元宇宙」的东风，这款可爱度拉满的虚拟社交应用，吸引了许多人换装入住。
啫喱的启动页妥妥地向「小而美」致敬，站在月球上遥望着已经萌化的地球，在加入这个可爱的元宇宙之前，你需要为自己创造一个虚拟形象，是时候祭出玩 RPG 游戏攒下的传统艺能——捏脸。你可以调整自己的五官、发型，搭配各式各样的服饰，你可以直接调用整套穿搭节省时间，也可以细致地拣选每一件潮流单品，这里所有的装扮都没有性别之分，你可以自由地表达你的审美喜好。

虚拟形象设置完成，是时候开始找些事做了。应用目前提供了 28 种活动项目和情绪表达，你可以在这个元宇宙中随心所欲地躺平，毫无节制地干饭和吨吨吨，或是在马桶上蹲一天，当然你也可以塑造勤奋向上的人设，继续努力搬砖。这个空间也会随着自然时间的流逝，不断地变换色彩，蓬勃的朝晖和浪漫的晚霞，这里也可以看到。
这么自由的空间，一个人独乐乐岂不是有些可惜，把小伙伴们拉进来，一起蹲坑，一起摸鱼，这样才能创造更多乐趣。

虽然啫喱主打的并不是熟人社交，但并没有微信摇一摇那样的功能，你可以通过昵称、手机号、通讯录或是二维码等形式添加好友。添加后，你的好友就会和你共享一个元宇宙，虚拟小人们会开始互动，你们还可以共享个人状态、地理位置和手机电量…</span>

                    <span>春节假期结束了，不知道大家这个年过得怎么样？在疫情下，春节热闹十足的场面似乎已成了我们记忆里的宝藏。同样深埋在记忆里的，还有那些经典老片。
得益于电影工作者近年来的努力，曾经那些耳熟能详的经典电影现在很多都有了 4K 修复版。这些影片当中既包括红色经典影片，又包括动画片，还包括一些体育片、歌舞片。部分经典电影的 4K 修复版可以在网上观看，比如西瓜视频推出的 西瓜视频大风车小剧场 中有很多修复版的经典动画片；而另一部分则已经在院线上映，观众可以至影院观看。
当然，对于那些对经典影片情有独钟的观众，网易也有一个 公版影像典藏计划，目前该计划收集了中外 613 条影像内容。感兴趣的朋友也可以移步直接观看原版。
电影修复的老手艺与新科技
电影是第七艺术，其原理是利用了视觉暂留现象。在电影中，那些看似连续的画面实则是由一帧帧单独的照片组成，这一帧帧单独的照片构成了（下文中将会提到的）电影修复的基础。在人类迈向数字时代以前，胶片是记录电影的载体。无论是早期的无声电影，还是后期的有声电影，都是用电影胶片记录的。

电影胶片对环境的要求比较苛刻。绝大部分胶片的存储环境并不理想，导致其使用寿命大大缩短，并容易产生一系列的问题，比如「齿孔收缩、酸化、划痕、霉斑、药膜脱落」等。不知道你有没有留意过，童年村口大荧幕上的电影画面总是充满了斑驳与闪烁。（这种印象之深，以至于认为电影本该如此。）而实际上，这就是胶片电影在存放、使用与流转过程中发生的胶片受损。
老电影 修复 通常包括三个阶段：物理修复、数字扫描和数字修复。这里拣着感兴趣的点，我们一起来围观一下。
物理修复
我们先从胶片的物理修复看起。胶片的物理修复是一门老手艺。套用一句话「我在故宫修文物」，即「我在电影制片厂修胶片」。

                    <span>随着人们卫生意识的提高，人们越发重视「菊花」的清洁，市场上兼具清洁、烘干、加热功能的智能马桶也渐渐普及。便后冲洗，洗去残留的粪便，还带烘干，保证了肛周的干燥环境，这是人类在便后清洁这件事上的大进步。
但显然，并不是每个家庭中都有条件配备自动冲洗马桶，对于租房者来说，换装智能马桶盖的机会可能也没有。至于公共场所，就更难以寻得良厕。如此一来，想要呵护菊花、远离疾病，湿厕纸就成了方便快捷的不二之选。
「菊花」带来的问题
粪便是脏的，这是一个再浅显不过的常识。打小家长就教导我们，每次如厕之后都要擦干净，不然会生病。屁股擦不干净，粪便有残留，里面的细菌自然就容易滋生繁殖，进而引起疾病，甚至出现反复，比如胃肠道疾病，以及肛周疾病如肛周脓肿等。
正常情况，人体排出的粪便中 1/3 到 2/3 的固体成分都是肠道菌群，这些是共生在我们的肠道中，辅助我们消化吸收的「益生菌」，比如乳酸菌、消化性球菌、消化链球菌等等。而当人体本身患有胃肠道疾病时，粪便中便可能携带有害的细菌，即致病菌、病原菌。
粪便中常见的病原菌有引起痢疾的志贺菌属、引起食物中毒或败血症的沙门杆菌、也有致病性大肠杆菌、金黄色葡萄球菌等，都能引起程度不等的胃肠道疾病。早在 2001 年，美国亚利桑那大学的一项研究 发现，平均每条内裤含有 0.1 克的粪便，最高可达 10 克，而如果是一个感染了沙门杆菌的患者，这些残留在内裤的 0.1 克粪便，就可能含有 1 亿到 10 亿的沙门氏菌。致病性肠道细菌又往往通过粪口传播1，残留在粪便中的细菌，极可能会成为疾病传染的源头。
因此，便后擦干净，不仅是为了我们自己的肛周安全，也是为了身边人的健康着想。
但是在人类的进化史中，为了方便排便，肛周进化呈现为多褶皱的结构，「菊花」这个形象的代名词也是由此而来。这样褶皱多的菊花样结构也就决定了单纯的干纸擦拭，其实很难完全擦干净，且一旦用力过猛，很容易…</span>

汽车工业设计会把用户假设为二傻子的，这个二傻子会做很多匪夷所思的事情。包括但不限于把头伸进正在关闭的车窗中、用手摸摸点烟器有没有电、时速120km/h情况下按下熄火开关、油门刹车同时踩下去等等等。
汽车工业设计的逻辑是通过设计，在源头上避免二傻子这些操作产生不良后果，而不是寄希望于二傻子不去做这些匪夷所思的动作。

电子手刹在设计之初就考虑到了你可能会误操作，因此高速状态下的短暂误触操作会直接被行车电脑忽视。
长时间按下电子手刹按键会触发紧急制动，此时效果等同于我们全力踩刹车，同时ESP也会介入工作，保持车身稳定。
这时候的结果多严重，就要看命硬不硬了。
命硬的后方无车，不会追尾。
被命运安排好轮回的，可能后边就是一辆开了一晚上车的疲劳驾驶的司机驾驶的超载的并且拉了一车钢卷的濒临报废的大卡车。
唯一的好消息是，这个情况下追尾后车负全责。
珍爱生命，请勿高速上触发紧急制动。
汽车上的类似在设计上避免二傻子受伤害的功能还很多：

1、开车门自动挂入P档，防止溜车。
2、行驶中（时速11km/h以上）无法挂入P档、R档。
3、车窗、天窗、后备箱防夹功能。

4、行驶中误触点火开关不熄火。长按也会熄火，此时车辆会进入滑行状态。
5、刹车油门同时踩下去保证车能刹车，直到停下。
6、儿童安全锁，避免婴幼儿误触开车门造成危险。特别注意：行车自动落锁不能取代儿童安全锁使用，行车自动落锁后，车内依然能开门。
7、事故自动拨打求助电话。气囊弹出后，车机自动拨打博世救援平台电话。
8、不踩下刹车，无法挂入前进挡D档位。
9、天窗遇雨自动关闭。
10、车辆行车自动落锁。
11、车辆启动或通电状态下，无法在车外通过钥匙锁车。
12、座椅无论怎么调节，不会顶破风挡玻璃。
这个世界还是很有爱的，感谢工程师。
对了上帝设计人类也是这个逻辑，你无法自己憋气把自己窒息死亡。
（声明：并不是所有的车都具有我所说的上述功能，但是上述功能都是量产车中提供的功能。）

                    <span>大家好，我们是《师父》的开发团队Slocap，出于对中国功夫与中华文化的敬意与热爱，我们团队用心创作了《师父》这款游戏，真诚地希望你们能够喜欢！我们也将认真听取你们的反馈，尽最大努力改进游戏！ 

中国文化源远流长，有许多取之不尽、用之不竭的元素和符号，《师父》作为一款以中国风为设计主题、中国城市为故事背景的游戏，我们也加入了许多能够代表中华文化的意象，融入了游戏的玩法和UI设计之中，希望能够创造一种足够有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅！ 
例如在游戏中，玩家可以在关卡场景的一些角落发现一个闪着光的“玉玺”，玩家与其交互之后，就可以进入技能和能力成长系统，花费掉自己积攒的经验值来解锁更强力的招式与战斗技巧。一旦使用过之后，这个玉玺便会不再发光，玩家需要在之后的关卡中继续寻找另一个闪光玉玺，才能继续解锁能力、不断成长——玩家们，在地图之中时，可要瞪大眼睛了。 

例如在游戏中，玩家扮演的主角拥有死而复生的能力（在游戏序章就会展现出来），这样的能力来源于一个家族继承的宝物——我们把它设计成了一个五枚铜钱组成的坠饰。它会时刻挂在主角的腰间（玩家可以轻而易举地注意到，提醒自己余下的生命长度），当死亡次数达到一定的限度时，其中一枚铜钱便会崩裂，当五枚铜钱皆依次崩裂时，玩家将失去复生的能力，最后一次死亡将是永久的告别——玩家们，在酣畅战斗之时，也要注意自己腰间的铜钱所剩几何。 
还有更多中国文化相关的元素和设计潜藏在游戏中的方方面面，或许是墙上的标语、收音机中的新闻、主角武馆中的装潢等等，这些元素浸润在游戏之间，也是我们努力学习并尽力描绘出美丽的中华文化的成果——我们希望《师父》能够是一场令人难忘又热血沸腾的中国功夫之旅！

《师父》已经于2022年2月8日上线Epic商城和PlayStation商城，这是一款以中国功夫：白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的动作冒险游戏，追求拳拳到肉的战斗体验。玩家将扮演一位功夫学徒，不断成长与进步，最终战胜弑亲的凶手们。 
希望你们能够喜欢！

                    <span>大家好，我们是《师父》的开发团队Slocap，出于对中国功夫与中华文化的敬意与热爱，我们团队用心创作了《师父》这款游戏，真诚地希望你们能够喜欢！我们也将认真听取你们的反馈，尽最大努力改进游戏！ 
《师父》是一款以中国风作为设计主题、中国城市作为游戏背景、中国功夫白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的游戏。因此为了创造出一场真正具有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅，我们也潜行学习了中国功夫和中华文化，虽然掌握的可能只是九牛一毛，但依然希望能够给玩家带来令人印象深刻的记忆！ 

因此，在游戏《师父》中也有许多有趣的细节或是彩蛋—— 
1.不同于其他的时间循环与Roguelite机制，《师父》采用了一套独特的死亡与成长机制：当你在战斗中死去，你会再次复活，为此你付出的代价就是衰老。每一次死去，都会老去一点。玩家的初始年龄是20岁，经过多次倒下后，年龄最大上限为75岁左右（根据游玩方式来判定最大年龄），一旦超过这个界限，就将永久死亡。 
2.不断死去，不断衰老——玩家在不同的年龄段会有不同的战斗特点，最直观的影响就是：年龄越大，生命值越低、攻击力越强。

3.玩家扮演的功夫学徒腰间有一个五枚铜钱组成的坠饰，它代表了玩家拥有死而复生的能力，它会时刻挂在主角的腰间（玩家可以轻而易举地注意到，提醒自己余下的生命长度），当死亡次数达到一定的限度时，其中一枚铜钱便会崩裂，当五枚铜钱皆依次崩裂时，玩家将失去复生的能力，最后一次死亡将是永久的告别；类似的这些沉浸式UI还有很多，都是为了提醒玩家自己所处的年龄阶段，根据年龄来选择更有利的战斗方式。 
4.《师父》具有极高的重玩性与耐玩度，你在另一个地图关卡中可能会寻找到有关于另一个地图关卡的线索——它或许可以帮助你打开一扇封闭的门，绕过一大群敌人来抄近路，更快地找到关卡BOSS。

5.《师父》的动作指导是一位真正的白眉拳功夫大师：Benjamin Colussi——他曾经前往佛山，拜师于白眉拳大师刘伟新，学成之后回到法国开设了武馆，潜心钻研并传播中国功夫。 
6.《师父》中玩家所处的武馆里，有一个供奉师父的牌位，游戏中的对联是完全复刻于白眉拳大师刘伟新与其弟子Benjamin Colussi武馆中的装潢。上联：学武学艺学仁义；下联：尊祖尊师尊武德；横批：武学之道。现实中牌位上供奉的宗师是：佛山白眉拳一代宗师刘少良；而游戏中将牌位上供奉的照片换为了主角的父亲。

                    <span>Ao trabalhar com duas máquinas diferentes, podemos ficar acostumados com atalhos de uma não presentes na outra. No meu caso, trabalhando com Mac e Ubuntu, senti muita falta das gestures do trackpad do Mac na minha máquina Linux. Por exemplo, ao deslizar três dedos para cima no Mac, acessa-se o Mission Control, mostrando todas as janelas abertas. E eu também queria ter esse tipo de controle no Ubuntu.
Para resolver isso, instalei e configurei o fusuma, um projeto open-source para habilitar multitouch gestures no Linux. O README do fusuma é bem completo, mas vou deixar aqui o meu passo a passo e configurações.
Isso foi feito no Ubuntu 21.10 e fusuma v2.3.0.

Chrome Extensions are small programs, that can be installed to Google Chrome web browser to enrich its features. Usually, to install a Chrome Extension, a user should open Chrome Web Store, find the required extension, and install it from there. 
In this article, I will show, how to create a Chrome Extension from scratch. The extension which we will create today will use Chrome APIs to get access to the content of web pages, which opened in a web browser and extract different information from them. Using these APIs you can not only read content from web pages but also write content to them and interact with these pages, like, for example, automatically pressing buttons or following links. This feature can be used for a wide range of browser automation tasks like scrapping re…</span>

                    <span>TLDR: It’s not about the technical side, it’s about people!
Monoliths can be as good as anything... on the technical side, but something some people fail to consider is the Dev Experience.
People will be working with them, not only now, but in the future.
Even if you start small today, in a few years, maybe dozens or more people will have to use it... and well... they won’t like using it.
If you’re a developer... you’re probably nodding right now.
What would you say if I showed a 1500 lines file?
You would probably be like: “What the hell?”
Even with a proper organization... dozens or hundreds of classes and functions are something overwhelming.
Then why a monolith with dozens or hundreds of files is “not a problem”? Even with a proper organization, its scope is too big to grasp. 
And when…</span>

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;m a college student majoring in web development.
https://shihokazama-portfolio-miacan2021.vercel.app/
Today, I&#x27;ll share my experience of how I learned React. Hopefully, It will be helpful to someone who is a beginner at coding and struggling to understand React.
I entered my college in Apr 2021. 
https://eager-knuth-847dfa.netlify.app/
I started studying React in June but It didn&#x27;t work. I couldn&#x27;t understand React at all, even after watching several tutorials and googling &quot;React for beginners&quot; lots of times.
Some web developers said you don&#x27;t need to study Javascript a lot, we don&#x27;t use Javascript. We use React. So, you have to study React, not Javascript.
a JavaScript library. 
I wrote the whole code (add cart, delete cart, shop items are in class etc...) in Javascript. I didn&#x27;t copy others&#x27; code at all, I thought myself how I operate it in Javascript. I was sure I have a solid knowledge of vanilla JS at last!
https://gracious-khorana-5ef5d7.netlify.app/
I restarted my React learning in September. I could understand it easily!!!
I created my first React project in September it was a chatbot.
https://vigorous-hoover-828c01.netlify.app/
And I made a weather app using API in September.
https://happy-hawking-f6969d.netlify.app/
I wrote an article about React Hooks in December.
https://dev.to/miacan2021/my-memorandum-react-hooks-usecontext-usereducer-usememo-usecallback-useref-3i4k
And then, I created React Redux project in December.
https://focustube.vercel.app/
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m growing as a front-end developer very fast.
Through this process, I think I have escaped from being a complete programming beginner. I learned that understanding a programming language takes a certain amount of time and that it is important to build up a solid knowledge base.
Thank you.</span>

                    <span>React has two types of components - functional &amp; class. Traditionally, only class components were allowed to have state and lifecycle methods. However, that changed with the introduction of hooks in React 16.8.
Now functional components also have access to state and lifecycle methods. For simple states, we use the useState hook and for handling more complex states, we use the useReducer hook. For the lifecycle methods, we use the useEffect hook.
In this article, we will be covering the useState hook in an in-depth fashion. The ultimate goal of this article is to hopefully make sure that you don&#x27;t have to go elsewhere to learn more about useState.
Hooks were introduced to React in version 16.8. They are just regular JavaScript functions. Hooks helps us &quot;hook into&quot; state and lifecycle method…</span>

Unfortunately, although I&#x27;d love to answer everyone, I don&#x27;t have the time. Instead of answering everyone individually, I decided to write a detailed breakdown of how I became a developer advocate.
To be clear, people take many different routes into Developer Relations, so my route is not the only way and not the best. My path to DevRel could&#x27;ve been shorter and more straightforward. Similar to those asking me, I was also dying to figure out how to get into Developer Relations. A year ago, I was also sliding into DMs asking the same question.  Fortunately, I found plenty of informative content from DevRel lead…</span>

                    <span>A fim de tentar agilizar, minimamente que seja, o início de um dia de trabalho, procurei uma forma de automatizar a abertura do VS Code no projeto e o start do servidor da API.
Digitava esses comandos todas as vezes e agora só preciso digitar apiMission.sh que tudo fica pronto para codar no projeto.
O código abaixo foi salvo no arquivo apiMission.sh na pasta Scripts dentro da pasta do meu usuário na minha máquina.
echo &quot;🤖 Opening API project in VSCode...&quot;
cd /home/eraldo/Work/mission-brasil/api
code .
sleep 2
echo &quot;✅ Done!&quot;
sleep 1
echo &quot;🤖 Starting server...&quot;
sleep 1
yarn start:dev

Depois tornei esse arquivo executável.
sudo chmod +x apiMission.sh
Só com isso já poderia executar o ./apiMission.sh, dentro da pasta Scripts, que o projeto seria aberto no VSCode e o servidor iria iniciar.
Mas aí há a possibilidade de colocar essa pasta no path do sistema para digitar apiMission.sh em qualquer lugar para iniciar rodar o script.
No meu caso, que uso Linux, inseri a linha abaixo no arquivo .profile
PATH&#x3D;&quot;$PATH:/home/eraldo/Scripts&quot;
Agora é só abrir o terminal e rodar apiMission.sh para iniciar o projeto da API e começar a codar nele.
Observações:
Ainda é um script bem básico. Estarei verficando a possibilidade de retorno da mensagem de confirmação após o programa realmente abrir e, em caso de erro, parar a execução do script.. algo nessa linha.
Estou verificando se há a possibilidade de executar o script em um terminal e realizar comandos em outra janela... o intuito é abrir editor nos projetos e iniciar api e frontend rodando um único script.</span>

                    <span>Talking about Questions And Answers in software development is talking about stackoverflow.com (SO from now on). There&#x27;s a bad experience shared among many beginners in this site and that&#x27;s a shame. Instead of taking a gatekeeping attitude, my intention here is to explain several common errors and misconceptions that lead to this bad experience in SO and how to avoid them to get the most out of that great community.

If you&#x27;re an experienced user and have read/heard any rant about stack overflow you&#x27;ll instantly notice that most of the problems people have could be solved if they just read the guidelines.

                    <span>GitHub 推出赞助商专属存储库

几年前，GitHub 引入了赞助功能，允许任何人财务赞助开源开发者。而现在，GitHub 推出了 赞助商专属存储库，也就是只有赞助商才能访问的私人存储库。这些存储库可以分为不同的赞助级别。有了赞助商专属仓库，开发者不仅可以募集捐款，还可以更好地与赞助商（企业或其他）进行更深入、更个性化的接触。


老王点评：虽然这样使受益和付出更一致，但是，与开源的关系呢？我觉得将来的发展未必是人们所期望的。




Go 语言正在测试对泛型和模糊处理的支持

Go 1.18 本周发布了 第二个测试版。在 1.18 中，通过 Go 语言服务器和 VSCode 扩展可以支持泛型。此外，还引入了模糊处理和新的 Go 工作区模式。Go 1.18 的测试版被证明是非常可靠的，谷歌称，“事实上，我们已经在谷歌这里的生产中运行它”。候选发布版也有望在本月晚些时候发布，最终的 Go 1.18 版预计在 3 月发布。


老王点评：Go 这样活跃开发的语言，只要坐等就可以预期不断有很多新特性和性能提升。




GNU/Hurd 使用 NetBSD 驱动程序来支持硬件

GNU/Hurd 的硬件支持一直处于非常粗糙的状态，缺乏完整的 x86_64 支持，缺少 USB 支持，最近才有一定程度的对声音的支持。即使它比 Linux 内核存在的时间更长，仍然还有漫长的道路需要走。它的开发者在 FOSDEM 2022 上说，他们在微内核环境中重新使用 NetBSD 内核驱动，以扩大 Hurd 的硬件支持范围。


老王点评：Hurd 发展的太慢了，不过这样可以利用其它系统的硬件驱动倒是一个好主意。</span>

                    <span>安装、配置和运行 HAProxy，在几个网络或应用服务器之间分配网络流量。




不是只有在一个大型公司工作才需要使用负载平衡器。你可能是一个业余爱好者，用几台树莓派电脑自我托管一个网站。也许你是一个小企业的服务器管理员；也许你确实在一家大公司工作。无论你的情况如何，你都可以使用 HAProxy 负载平衡器来管理你的流量。

HAProxy 被称为“世界上最快和使用最广泛的软件负载平衡器”。它包含了许多可以使你的应用程序更加安全可靠的功能，包括内置的速率限制、异常检测、连接排队、健康检查以及详细的日志和指标。学习本教程中所涉及的基本技能和概念，将有助于你使用 HAProxy 建立一个更强大的、远为强大的基础设施。

为什么需要一个负载平衡器？

负载平衡器是一种在几个网络或应用服务器之间轻松分配连接的方法。事实上，HAProxy 可以平衡任何类型的传输控制协议（TCP）流量，包括 RDP、FTP、WebSockets 或数据库连接。分散负载的能力意味着你不需要因为你的网站流量比谷歌大就购买一个拥有几十万 G 内存的大型网络服务器。

负载平衡器还为你提供了灵活性。也许你现有的网络服务器不够强大，无法满足一年中繁忙时期的峰值需求，你想增加一个，但只是暂时的。也许你想增加一些冗余，以防一个服务器出现故障。有了 HAProxy，你可以在需要时向后端池添加更多的服务器，在不需要时删除它们。

你还可以根据情况将请求路由到不同的服务器。例如，你可能想用几个缓存服务器（如 Varnish）来处理你的静态内容，但把任何需要动态内容的东西，如 API 端点，路由到一个更强大的机器。

在这篇文章中，我将通过设置一个非常基本的 HAProxy 环境，使用 HTTPS 来监听安全端口 443，并利用几个后端 Web 服务器。它甚至会将所有进入预定义 URL（如 /api/）…</span>

                    <span>Maybe you&#x27;ve heard that playwright William Shakespeare contributed 1,700 new words to the English language. But did you know that he has an entire programming language as well?
SPL (Shakespeare programming language) was created to make source code resemble Shakespeare plays. It is an esoteric language, also known as an esolang. An esolang is a computer programming language designed to experiment with weird ideas, create a challenge for programmers, or simply serve as a source of amusement, rather than for practical use.

有时候选择比较少也是一件好事，例如在 React 中通常只盛行一到两个状态管理解决方案，而Flutter 自从 2020 年末开始，每个月似乎都有新的状态管理方案出现，因此这里主要罗列出它们的一些优劣，从而帮助你选择最适合的状态管理方案。
基础
一般在无需修改 pubspec.yaml文件的情况下，你默认有两种状态管理解决方案可以选择，大多数时候这就足够了。
setState

setState 仅在本地范围内有效，如果一个 Widget 需要改变它自己的状态，那么 setState 就是你最好的选择。
例如：修改开关是打开还是关闭，或者存储改变正在输入的文本内容，这种场景你真的不需要考虑任何其它状态管理包。
我的经验法则是：如果只在此 Widget 中需要有状态变量，或者在该控件树下恰好只有 1 个上下的 Widget，则它属于本地范围，这时候直接使用 StatefulWidget 是最合适不过。
如果你需要将状态在控件树内向下传递树，那么只需将变量放在子 Widget 的构造函数中；如果相同的变量需要传递到 2+  Widget 的构造函数，那么这时候才需要研究更高范围的状态管理。
InheretedWidget
前面我们在 setState 中讨论的那个开关，如果它是控制应用是处于暗模式还是亮模式，如果在这种情况下，你就需要将状态提升到可以更好地沿控件树传播的某个位置。
而在你使用第三方框架去完成这个需求时，让我们看一下 InheretedWidget 。
InheretedWidget 允许它下面的任何 Widget 访问它的属性，…</span>

                    <span>特别鸣谢：糖萌芦(Undertale Engine)。

这个教程为入门教程，旨在让小白通过Gamemaker制作第一个属于自己的审判战，为后期教程打下基础。

入门教程：创建敌人，给玩家背包添加物品，第一个回合，控制战斗框，简单的弹幕，控制屏幕，时间线（Timeline），复杂的弹幕，绘制（Draw），带特效的弹幕，着色器（Shader），扭曲的屏幕，骨头模板的使用。

学习此教程后，我们就能够理解UndertaleMaker的制作原理，从而在将来UTM出版的时候能更快的掌握。

                    <span>长期只用一边吃饭，时间长了，不仅毁牙，还会毁容哦。这位女士长期使用左侧牙齿偏侧咀嚼，那左边的牙齿就会双倍磨耗。右侧就会容易堆积牙结石。还会变成大小脸，左侧脸大，右侧脸小，右侧咬肌经常不用就会萎缩变小。
另外还会损伤颞下颌关节，就是两只耳朵的前方，把手指放在耳朵前面，然后张开嘴闭上嘴，就能感受到这个关节。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

本文会介绍如何通过 Shortcut 来从 Unsplash 中随机挑选一张壁纸。下面是 GIF 演示：

关于 Shortcut 的基本原理，我派已经有很多篇非常优秀的文章去解释了，本文不做过多讲解，只会贴一些如何配置的截图。
 
要想达成这个技巧，你至少需要准备以下工作：

注册 Unsplash 账号
获取 Unsplash 开发者 Access Key
了解基本的 Shortcut 使用方式

第三点不是必要的，因为我会在文末分享我的 Shortcut，你只需要在导入它的时候填一下你注册的 Access Key 就可以了。
本文为了方便，大部分 Shortcut 界面截图都是基于 macOS 12.1 的版本。如果你只有 iOS 设备，不要觉得陌生，在界面上应该差距不会太大。
那么我们开始吧～
获取 Unsplash Access Key
没有账号的话，需要先在官网注册。在注册成功后，回到主站，可以看到右上角的汉堡图标。
点击「汉堡」图标打开菜单
点击后就可以看到 Developers。

或者，你直接输入 https://unsplash.com/developers 就好了🌚
 
进入开发者站点后，我们点击 「your apps」。

接着点击 「New Application」。

条款界面全部选上即可。

接着就是输入你的 App 名字，我们就叫它 「My automation tool」吧～

点击「Create application」并成功进入开发者管理后台后，应该可以看到：

                    <span>随着「大魔头」奥密克戎的到来，全国的防疫局势都充满了不确定因素。在积极面对疫情的同时，不少深圳人也无奈地感慨：今年过年又回不了家了。
既然决定留深过年，总得找点风景怡人的地方逛一逛，深圳湾就是这样一个好地方。深圳湾公园毗邻蛇口、南山等深圳最繁华的区域，沿线能同时欣赏到漂亮的城市景观和自然风光；作为一处海滨开放式公园，深圳湾又有着怡人的空气和广阔的活动空间。不仅如此，深圳湾公园不是简单的步行通道，其沿线还有各种主题公园和活动场所，无论你想在假期期间一个人静静还是陪家人走走，亦或带孩子玩玩，深圳湾公园都是安全又舒适的好去处。
除了欣赏风景，深圳湾也是我进行街头摄影最多的去处，沿途能遇见各种各样有趣的人和场面，每次前往都能找到新鲜点。正因为去得多了，所以我对深圳湾非常熟悉，也充满感情。在本期城市漫步指南中，我想带你前往深圳湾，来一趟完整的深圳海滨之旅。

深圳湾公园在哪里？
深圳湾，又称「后海湾」，是位于深圳市和香港特别行政区之间的一个海湾，处于珠江的入海口末端。由于其被深圳蛇口半岛和香港元朗平原半包围而形成了一片夹在深圳和香港之间的半开放内海，也因此形成了深港隔海相望的独特景观。
深圳湾俯视图，北部区域为深圳，南部区域为香港，西侧则为珠江口。图片截取自 Google Maps
二十一世纪初，深圳市政府联合多家机构和单位，历经八年的规划和建设，在深圳湾沿海一带修建了深圳湾公园。深圳湾公园全称「深圳湾海滨城市公园」，南临深圳湾公路大桥，东至红树湾自然保护区，全长约十三公里。深圳湾公园整体分为「滨海休闲带」和「生态公园」两个部分，两者分别为南北、东西走向的两条通道，组合在一起恰好在地图上构成了一个标准的直角造型。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #效率 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

「效率」，放置在个人和整体中，这是一个做事的时候皆需要考虑的词。在个人层面上，我们谈论「效率」时，通常它的前面会有一个修饰语，比如「学习效率」、「工作效率」。在我们说提高效率的时候，指的是在做一件事时，能够用更快的速度，更简单的方式实现它。高效也是一个大多数人都关心的话题，而且「如何利用各种效率工具让自己变得更高效」，似乎已经成为了一个预设好的、默认的好的事情。
在 2021 年，我也不出意外地使用了很多软件、尝试了很多种工具，主要包括知识的获取和整理，时间和日程的管理。与之前不同，我的一大改变是不再追求更复杂更齐全的功能，更倾向使用简单的、但可以达到核心需求的工具。
效率背后的逻辑
在聊具体的效率工具之前，我们先捋一捋效率背后的逻辑。
有效、无效和半有效时间
提高效率，换一个说法就是节省时间。从时间这个角度出发，我们先分解我们平时在工作和学习时花费的时间，看看我们到底把时间花在了哪里。如果把工作或者学习的时间摊开来看，可以把整块时间分成三块，分别是有效时间、半有效时间和无效时间。
有效时间指的是那些真正有突出的进展的时间，它只占整块时间的很小一部分。突出的进展就类似解决了某个 bug，看懂了某个原理。这样的时间也可以被认为是做事时真正有用的时间。
所谓无效时间指的是做一件事情的过程中完全不用花的时间，这段时间纯粹是无用时间。举个例子，如果要使用远程服务器跑一段程序，那么设置 IDE 的远程连接可以说是在这个场景下最优的做法，而其他的方法，比如将代码文…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我们是《师父》的开发团队Slocap，出于对中国功夫与中华文化的敬意与热爱，我们团队用心创作了《师父》这款游戏，真诚地希望你们能够喜欢！我们也将认真听取你们的反馈，尽最大努力改进游戏！ 
《师父》是一款以中国风作为设计主题、中国城市作为游戏背景、中国功夫白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的动作冒险游戏。玩家将扮演一位踏上复仇之路的功夫学徒，独自一人闯入危机四伏的现代江湖。 我们渴望创造出一场真正具有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅。

如何评价我们的游戏，这个应该交由每一位玩家来定夺，这才是最为公允、客观的方式。作为制作了这款游戏的独立开发团队，我们只在这里简要介绍一下游戏的各个方面，来给新入手或者感兴趣的玩家一些指引和帮助吧！ 
游戏首发支持中文字幕，后续即将更新加入中文配音！我们认为《师父》作为一款以中国功夫、中华文化为主题的游戏，中国玩家的认可和支持是十分重要的，我们也在不断改善游戏的中文本地化，并且与上海的专业配音团队合作，努力为玩家带来优秀的中文游戏体验。 
我们努力让游戏的战斗玩法足够有趣、真实、丰富且具有挑战性！游戏的战斗系统，以中国传统功夫白眉拳作为基础的招式体系，追求拳拳到肉的爽快战斗体验。融合白眉拳刚强凶猛、变化莫测的特点，玩家作为一代功夫学徒，在战斗中会使用多种攻击方式， 经过经验积累，可以解锁丰富的招式技能：例如过肩摔、扫堂腿、回旋踢等传统功夫招式； 通过多种武器的综合使用，结合武器技能，创造独特的战斗方式； 格挡、闪避、架势（体系）条的设计，以及多种处决技，令攻防都需小心谨慎； 专注度可以提供一个“子弹时间”式的额外招式，打乱敌人的战斗节奏。

我们想要创作一个独一无二的成长与死亡系统。每次死亡会使年龄增长，并且解锁不同年龄下的战斗技能，使玩家能够构筑独一无二的玩法思路。本作采用十分独特的成长机制：玩家在生命值归零后，会短暂倒下，再次复苏时会使年龄增长； 年龄增长…</span>

Problem：
看来这个游戏的重点在*胜利*，全部战线上都不允许有任何败绩。商业投资和创业产业上要赢，爱与人际关系上要赢，政治上要赢，意识形态上要赢，妈的，甚至在性的方面也要赢。肯定还涉及了一大堆与物质相关的胜利 —— 你要把某件东西成功地搞到手，绝对不能弄丢。但问题来了：我们眼前并没多少赢家，绝大部分人都在溃败。怎么会这样？你又怎么可能立于*不败*之地呢？

本来想说，今年的年度总结在公司的公众号交了一篇差。那么再往后去探讨一些话题其实就没有必要了。但是在写作这篇文章开始的一周，到处传出来的却是裁员的声音。从心动开始，B站跟进。此外还有很多内部确认了但外部没有确认的消息在蔓延。
缩编，裁撤，项目停滞。这是2022年中国游戏行业的开端。与2021年Clubhouse的群贤毕至相比，2022年的前景显得并不是那么光明。
与之相对的是，我们仍然可以看到年会照片里堆成山的PS5，iPhone或是各式各样的高科技硬通货，由游戏行业参与者们所组成的二手交易群里仍然是火热的交易信息。在更早一些的时候，吉比特就传出过奖励明星项目制作人一套房子的新闻。如果你跟年轻一些的社群有交集的话，你会不可避免地发现，前来游戏行业淘金俨然是一种主流。
一方面是裁员的信息，一方面是仍然是直白的物质驱动。在2022年初这个时间点，作为局中人，我们很难说这会是很好过的一年；但要是与其它的行当相比，那么好像还有那么些侥幸可以去钻。



如此我们不得不回望2021年的国内游戏市场，这个市场到底是什么样的？

I was working on a NodeJS/Express application for practice and I remembered I pushed the .env file to my remote repository. While working on fixing this error, I thought about how many people would have made this error and it is going to stay somewhere in the commit histories even if the secrets eventually get unstaged.
GitHub search. While most of the results are not an actual connection string,  a good number of them are still alive and functional.

                    <span>If you want to develop SEO friendly and fast websites with React, you have two choices: server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).
There are some awesome frameworks like remix.run , next.js, astro or 11ty, which allow you to use one of (or both) techniques. So if you&#x27;re building a production app, I recommend using one of them because server-side rendering is quite hard to get right.
But if you want to understand how it works and what is happening under the hood in these frameworks, you definately should try it out. This article will focus on how SSR works and we will also go through a simple example of using SSR.
Server-side rendering means rendering the initial HTML on the server instead of waiting for the JavaScript to be loaded in the browser and then rendering.

                    <span>It’s been too long I have been researching for how to become a full stack developer by yourself I thought of sharing my experience with you all.
Many people ask the question “How to start developing?” because when you are beginner, you don&#x27;t know nothing about coding.
So, I decided to write a quick introduction to web development: How to start creating websites and apps even if you are a complete noob.
Everyone that want to become a great developer need to know at least the basics of HTML and CSS. These technologies are understood by the most famous chromes(Google Chrome, Firefox, internet explore, Brave and others). HTML will help to add elements and text and CSS will add style to it.
In addition you need to know javascript, because javascript technology beacause it will make the website …</span>

                    <span>A few weeks ago, I posted a review on The Choice, the first book for Dr. Edith Eger. It&#x27;s a book that is mostly an autobiography of a Holocaust survivor, but it&#x27;s much more than a recital of what happened to her during the year that she spent at death camps. 
The book was published in 2017, 72 years after she was deliberated at the age of 17. She had way more to share than the horror.
Her second book, The Gift is the condensed version of what the author learnt as a psychologist both from herself and from her patients about leading a happy life. A life that is not full of resentment and hate. A life in which you could let things go and forgive yourself and others.
The lessons, her messages are organized around 12 prisons you lock yourself up to.

                    <span>Learn what parameters, arguments, and return statements are with videos and animations.
Let’s understand what is a JavaScript Parameter &amp; Argument.
general idea of a function, function definition &amp; function invocation.
Table Of Contents:
JavaScript Variables in Functions

JavaScript Functions-Parameters &amp; Arguments

JavaScript return statement
JavaScript functions can also contain variables.
addNumbers() to demonstrate.
function addNumbers() {
const a &#x3D; 5;
const b &#x3D; 10;
const sum &#x3D; a + b; // 5 + 10
return sum;
}
console.log(addNumbers());


Code Explanation:
{}, we have 3 variables a, b and sum, with values.
return keyword.
addNumbers();.
But we can change the above code, using parameters &amp; arguments to replace variable declaration and assignment.
JavaScript function parameters are the names (placeholders) for values.
arguments are the actual values of parameters.
Let me explain it to you like we are having a street conversation, or talk in an informal language.
Parameters are variable names. The word parameter is just a fancy word for saying variable name in JS.
Arguments are the actual values of those variables. The word argument is just another fancy word for saying variable value

So we use parameters(variable names) to refer to argument (variable values)
Makes sense? Let&#x27;s see it in code, or better convert the above function&#x27;s variables &amp; their values to parameters &amp; arguments.
function addNumbers(a, b) {
const sum &#x3D; a + b; // 5 + 10
return sum;
}
console.log(addNumbers(5, 10));

Code Explanation:
{}.
().
addNumbers(5, 10).
Most people can’t see the relationship between parameters &amp; arguments (including myself).
Notice, we don’t need to use a JavaScript keyword const, let or var to declare the variables a and b, inside the () parentheses.
The JavaScript return statement as it sounds, it returns something.

                    <span>Why are databases important? When we access our favorite applications like Twitter and Instagram, we are able to log into our accounts and access our posts and those of the accounts we follow. 
The photos, comments, user information, etc. is data. To keep it available to everyone it needs to be stored somewhere so when I make a request to see Kanye West&#x27;s Instagram profile I can see everything he&#x27;s posted (that is, if he doesn&#x27;t delete all of his posts for his next Yeezy campaign).
If we think about what else would be stored in Instagram&#x27;s databases we would start to get overwhelmed (and we have every right to be, it&#x27;s a lot of data)! How can we store a large amount of information in a clean, concise way? We do this by creating a relational database.

                    <span>These problems appeared in leecode and featured in various blogs, i have just summarised and included them using ts-problems deck.
Numbers generally increase in a roman numeral notation from right to left, any subtractive number must also be smaller than our current res.
So we can avoid the need for an extra variable here. We do run into the case of repeated numerals causing an issue III, but we can clear that by multiplying num by any number between 2 and 4 before comparing it to res, since the numerals jump in value by 5x.
Once we know how to properly identify a subtractive numeral, it&#x27;s a simple matter to just iterate in reverse through given numeral to find and return the res.
function romanToInt(s: string): number {
  let res: number &#x3D; 0;
  const symbols &#x3D; {
    I: 1,
    V: 5,
    X: 10,
    L: 50,
    C: 100,
    D: 500,
    M: 1000,
  };
  s.split(&quot;&quot;)
    .reverse()
    .forEach((char) &#x3D;&gt; {
      let val: number &#x3D; parseInt(symbols[char]);
      if (res &gt; 4 * val) {
        res -&#x3D; val;
      } else {
        res +&#x3D; val;
      }
    });
  return res;
}

This solution uses a lookup table composed which can help in easier conversion and much simple compared to the above one.
function intToRoman(num: number): string {
  let res:string &#x3D; &quot;&quot;;
  const value:number [] &#x3D; [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];
  const numerals:string [] &#x3D; [&quot;M&quot;,&quot;CM&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;CD&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;XC&quot;,&quot;L&quot;,&quot;XL&quot;,&quot;X&quot;,&quot;IX&quot;,&quot;V&quot;,&quot;IV&quot;,&quot;I&quot;]
  for (let i &#x3D; 0; num; i++)
    while (num &gt;&#x3D; value[i]){
        res +&#x3D; numerals[i];
         num -&#x3D; value[i];
    }
  return res;
}

                    <span>In this post I will show you how to create a simple login page in Python with the flask library and finally with gunicorn.
let&#x27;s begin!
Create the virtual env:
in the project directory :
python3 -m venv myenv
Then the linux command to activate the new env:
source /myenv/bin/activate
Now we are in our dev env.
From here install the flask library :
pip install flask
Now we can start to develop our flask app.
Create a file that you can call mylogin.py
In this file :
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, request

app &#x3D; Flask(__name__)

@app.route(&#x27;/&#x27;, methods&#x3D;[&#x27;GET&#x27;, &#x27;POST&#x27;])

O Spring Framework fornece um modelo abrangente de programação e configuração para aplicativos corporativos modernos baseados em Java em qualquer tipo de plataforma de implantação.
Spring é o suporte de infra-estrutura no nível do aplicativo: o Spring se concentra no “encanamento” dos aplicativos corporativos, para que as equipes possam se concentrar na lógica de negócios no nível do aplicativo, sem vínculos desnecessários a ambientes de implantação específicos.

PWA (Progressive Web App): according to web.dev
Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they are capable, reliable, and installable. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application.
So, PWA seems like a native app for mobile and desktop platforms but it runs in browsers capabilities.

                    <span>App description needs to be updated to clearly state the source of information and whether the app represents the government entity.
When I first submitted my US Election Info app, I got rejected.

These are the details:
Disclaimer/Source: Missing Clear Source of Information/Disclaimer
So I dug a bit further and found the following requirement:
Requirements for apps that communicate government information
Since my app does not affiliate with any government, I refer to Unaffiliated apps that communicate government information section. There are 2 things that I need to do:
Clearly conveying the sources to users in the app description, and
Making clear that the app does not represent a government or political entity.
I wasn&#x27;t sure, and I googled this a bit. It turned out that I need to update my App description. So I added the disclaimer at the end of the app description.
This is the exact text that I added:
Disclaimer
(1) Information on this app comes from the Google Civic Information API, which aggregates data across the United States on elected officials in federal, state, county and local government offices.
(2) This app does not represent any government or political entity. Your use of this information provided on this app is solely at your own risk.

Please note that you can add link in the app decription using  tag.
This is how the texts look like at the bottom of my app description:

After updating the app description, it gets approved!

                    <span>经过近三年的等待，Peppermint OS 11 来了，放弃了以 Ubuntu 作为其基础，并删除了 LXDE 组件。看起来不错！




Peppermint OS 11 是 2022 年最值得期待的版本 之一，而它终于到来了！

2020年，其主要开发者 Mark Greaves 不幸去世，Peppermint OS 失去了它最重要的贡献者之一。

现在，经过近两年的时间，Peppermint 11 来了！这不仅仅是一次普通的升级，Peppermint 11 是它的第一个以 Debian 为基础的版本，抛弃了 Ubuntu。

让我在下面指出该版本的所有关键细节。

Peppermint 11 有什么新东西？

该版本的主要亮点是放弃 Ubuntu，使用 Debian 64 位作为其基础。

从技术上讲，它基于 Debian 11 “Bullseye” 的稳定分支。因此，你可以预期 Debian 的最新改进出现在 Peppermint OS 11 中。

除了新的基础之外，还有一些其他的变化，包括：

XFce 4.16.2，无 LXDE 组件



Peppermint OS 利用 XFce 桌面环境与 LXDE 组件来提供混合体验。

Peppermint 11 已经删除了所有的 LXDE 组件，专注于提供一个 XFce 驱动的桌面体验。

Calamares 安装程序取代了 Ubiquity



为了改善安装过程，Peppermint 11 使用了现代 Calamares 安装程序。

新的欢迎应用程序



为了让你有一个良好的开端，Peppermint OS 现在包括一个新的欢迎应用程序，让你了解更多关于所使用的系统/组件，并安装开始使用所需的软件。

例如，你在 Peppermint 11 中没有预装默认的网络浏览器。你可以快速启动软件包选择器，安装 Firefox、GNOME、Tor、Falkon 和 Chromium 等浏览器。



新的 Peppermint Hub

新的 Peppermint Hub 合并了设置和控制中心来保持整洁，帮助你轻松管理系统。



新的应用程序

该版本包括一个基于终端的广告屏蔽器，即 hblock，可以在需要时启用或禁用。



Nemo 取代了 Thunar 作为默认的文件管理器，它应该感觉很熟悉，对许多用户来说可以派上用场。

其他改进

总的来说，有了新的基础和更新的 Linux 内核 5.10，Peppermint 11 应该是一个令人兴奋的选择。

在 发布说明 中的一些其他变化包括：


在安装过程中包含了一套精简的桌面墙纸。下载额外的壁纸请进入 Peppermint 中。

包括一套精简的图标和 XFce 主题。


现在 Peppermint OS 11 来了，你会考虑在你的主系统上尝试一下吗？你已经试过了吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。

                    <span>苹果改变隐私设置将导致 Meta 明年损失一百亿美元

之前，苹果默认允许广告商在移动设备上跟踪用户，但用户可以手动关闭跟踪。去年苹果以隐私保护的理由改变了这一行为，要求应用向用户询问是否愿意被跟踪。调查显示，54% 的苹果用户在看到该通知之后选择不要跟踪。苹果的这一变动降低了定位广告的准确度，进而降低了对广告商的吸引力。Meta 称，这将导致该公司在 2022 年 损失一百亿美元，占到了 2021 年收入的 8%。而雪上加霜的是，谷歌也准备在安卓中引入了类似的变动。

顺便说一句，Facebook 18 年历史上它的 日活用户首次下降。


老王点评：虽然这保护了隐私，但是我觉得广告商们不会这样坐以待毙，或许我们会见到更多广告位？




Meta 将引入虚拟现实形象之间的强制性距离

Meta 公司 VR 应用“地平线世界”的测试用户抱怨在网上被摸，呼吁在他们的虚拟现实形象周围建立一个保护性的气泡。Meta 公司 周五宣布，它正在旗下两个 VR 应用上引入个人界限，人与人之间的距离将相当于 VR 中的四英尺。


老王点评：不过，某些场景下我们需要更近的距离，或许可以设置个亲密白名单。




微软正式禁用 MSIX 应用安装协议

微软 正式宣布，它已经禁用了 MSIX 应用安装程序协议（ms-appinstaller:）以防止恶意攻击。该协议允许用户直接从网络服务器上安装各种应用程序，而不需要先将其下载到本地。然而，这种 Windows 应用程序安装方式后来被发现用来分发恶意的 PDF 文件。微软表示，它正在研究如何在未来某个时候以安全的方式重新启用该协议，比如添加某些组策略。


老王点评：本意是出于方便，但是却被利用。很多事情都是这样，便利和安全彼此抵触。

                    <span>不同的 Linux 系统以不同的方式处理辅助技术。 这里是一些对视觉、听觉、打字等有用的设置。




当我在 20 世纪 90 年代开始使用 Linux 时，我已经 40 多岁了，无障碍性accessibility不是我非常关注的问题。然而现在，当我快到 70 岁时，我的需求已经改变了。几年前，我从 System76 购买了一个全新的 Darter Pro，它的默认分辨率是 1920x1080，而且也是高 DPI。系统附带了 Pop!_OS，我发现我必须修改它才能看到显示屏上的图标和文字。谢天谢地，桌面上的 Linux 已经变得比 90 年代更容易使用了。

我需要辅助技术，特别是在视觉和听觉方面。还有一些我不使用的领域，但对需要帮助打字、指点、点击和手势的人来说是有用的。

不同的系统，如 Gnome、KDE、LXDE、XFCE 和其他系统，对这些辅助技术的处理方式不同。这些辅助性的调整大多可以通过 “设置Settings” 对话框或键盘快捷键来实现。

文字显示

我需要帮助来显示较大的文字，在我的 Linux Mint Cinnamon 桌面上，我使用这些设置：



我还发现 Gnome “优化Tweaks” 可以让我对桌面体验的文字显示大小进行微调。我把我的显示器的分辨率从默认的 1920x1080 调整到更舒适的 1600x900。以下是我的布局设置：



键盘支持

我不需要键盘支持，但它们是现成支持的，如下图所示：



更多无障碍选项

在 Fedora 35 上，无障碍访问也是熟悉的。打开 “设置Settings” 菜单，选择让 “总是显示无障碍菜单Always show Accessibility Menu” 图标在桌面上可见。我通常会切换 “大字体Large Text”，除非我在一个大显示器上。还有许多其他选项，包括 “缩放Zoom”、“屏幕阅读器Screen Reader” 和 “声音键Sound Keys”。这里有一些：



当在 Fedora 的 “设置Settings” 菜单中启用了 “无障碍菜单Accessibility Menu”，就很容易从右上角的图标中切换其他功能：



有一些 Linux 发行版是专门为需要无障碍支持的人设计的。Accessible Coconut 就是这样一个发行版。Coconut 基于 Ubuntu Mate 20.04，并默认启用了屏幕阅读器。它装载了 Ubuntu Mate 的默认应用。Accessible Coconut 是 Zendalona 的作品，该公司专门开发自由开源的无障碍应用。他们所有的应用都是以 GPL 2.0 许可证发布的，包括 iBus-Braille。该发行版包括屏幕阅读器、各种语言的打印阅读、六键输入、打字辅导、放大器、电子书扬声器等等。



Gnome 无障碍套件 是一个开源软件库，是 Gnome 项目的一部分，为实现无障碍功能提供 API。你可以通过访问他们的维基来参与 Gnome 无障碍团队。KDE 也有一个 无障碍项目 和一个支持该项目的 应用 列表。你可以通过访问他们的 维基 来参与 KDE 无障碍项目。XFCE 也为用户提供了相关资源。Fedora 项目维基 也有一个可以安装在操作系统上的无障碍应用的列表。

Linux 适合所有人

自 20 世纪 90 年代以来，Linux 已经有了长足的进步，其中一个很大的进步就是对无障碍的支持。很高兴知道随着 Linux 用户的不断变化，操作系统也可以和我们一起变化，并做出许多不同的支持选项。

                    <span>带着 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS 和 KDE Plasma 5.23 的最新改进，Slackware 15.0 已经来到。




欢呼吧！Linux 粉丝们会很高兴地知道，传奇发行版 Slackware 在很久之后发布了一个新版本。或许你不知道，Slackware 上一个版本的发布要追溯到 2016 年。

当开发者在去年（2021 年）2 月宣布 Slackware 15.0 的计划时，整个 Linux 社区都为此感到兴奋。

从年初的 Alpha 版本开始，在过去的一年里，开发人员在 Slackware Linux 15.0 的开发中取得了快速进展。经过一段时间后，他们发布了其最后一个候选版本，但现在它发布了！

让我们来看看 Slackware 15.0 有哪些新内容。

Slackware 15.0 的新内容



如前所述，Slackware 15.0 有许多变化。不要忘了，在最终发布之前，它可是发布了一个测试版和两个候选发布版（RC）。

如果你一直在关注我们的报道，早在去年 4 月份你就可能已经看到了我们的 测试版 报道。

在测试版 / RC 版中，还有一些东西没有被披露。因此，在这里，我们会介绍它的所有重要内容。

Linux 内核 5.15 LTS

Slackware 15 的主要亮点是增加了最新的 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。这与我们在测试版中注意到的 Linux 内核 5.10 LTS 相比，有了很大的飞跃。



值得注意的是，Slackware 团队在确定使用 Linux 内核 5.15.19 之前测试了数百个 Linux 内核版本。在发布说明中提到：


在最终宣布 Slackware 15.0 稳定版的过程中，我们在过去一年里实际上构建了超过 400 个不同的 Linux 内核版本（相比之…</span>

最近项目需要用到无重启动态换肤功能，本来打算用github上star最多的 Android-skin-support
但仔细一看发现太复杂而且2年没维护+大量issues没解决，最终放弃
经过探索，发现 Databinding+LiveData 能低成本实现无重启换肤
无重启动态换肤(不需要recreate())
无需制作皮肤包
无额外依赖(Databinding+LiveData本身几乎开发必备)
低侵入性
AppCompat和Material组件默认支持(少量属性需要额外支持或适配)
自定义View/第三方View 适配过程简单(写个绑定适配器就行了)
不需要使用 LayoutInflater.Factory
定义皮肤
以下代码定义了三个皮肤Default,Day,Night,通过调用 AppTheme.update(theme) 就可以完成动态换肤
这里皮肤只支持ColorStateList，因为大部分场景只要 ColorStateList 就够了
如果想要，Drawable/String等各种资源都能支持
data class Theme(
    val content: Int,
    val background: Int,
)

object Themes {
    val Default &#x3D; Theme(Color.RED, Color.GRAY)
    val Day &#x3D; Theme(Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE)
    val Night &#x3D; Theme(Color.MAGENTA, Color.BLACK)
}

object AppTheme {
    val background &#x3D; MutableLiveData()

                    <span>前言：长文警告
如标题所说，这篇文章是过去一年以 Notion 为中心对自己二十几年人生整个的重新思考和梳理。虽然主要是理念、思路和方法，可为了能承载这些内容，篇幅还是像第一篇那样朝不受控制的方向去了——全文 20000 多字。
但如果你和我一样，常年饱受「事情太多越忙越乱」「兴趣宽泛难以专注」「做事没有头绪不能深入」「文件资料长期杂乱无章」「一直重复造轮子」这类问题的折磨和困扰，花点时间和耐心读完本文，相信会对你有帮助和启发。
阅读全文至少需半小时，请合理安排时间。祝阅读愉快！

2021 是毕业后的第三年。第一年，从用 Markdown（Typora）列计划到初识 Notion，有了搭建体系的意识；第二年，在紧张与慌乱下探索极简中的边界与平衡；今年（2021），体系逐渐趋于成熟稳定，可以高效良好地运转。
回看过去这一年。2 ~ 6 月份，春节开工后，公司不停加班，无论是工作中项目管理的混乱，还是生活中个人资料的混乱，只让人感觉像无头苍蝇一样做事越来越没有头绪；6 月份有时间后本想简单整理一下，才发现已经混乱到根本不是一两个月就能整理完。
除此之外，2019、2020 养成的很多习惯如写周记月记在前半年也都没能继续——不是习惯丢了，而是发现之前的模式和方法已经难以承载，需要探索一套更好的体系。有打破，就意为着要重建。所以从半年前开始了这个旷日持久的庞大工程。
为什么要极简
自己是那种兴趣爱好比较杂，乱七八糟想法比较多的性格。好处是涉猎面相对广，选择较多不容易抑郁；但与此同时困扰也非常多，尤其到了人生的这个阶段，问题越来越严重明显：
因为兴趣爱好杂，做事东一榔头西一棒槌，需要并行的越来越多
在整理时发现，很多曾经想做的事都是做了一半而没有继续推进，或者曾经想看某些电影但一直没看，再或者几年前特别喜欢某个演员，心想一定要多关注 Ta 的作品，现在看到才想起来早已忘在了天边。

                    <span>城市是一个复杂的有机体。流动的车辆和人流，变化的红绿灯，漂浮的云彩……我们一般会说「我在城市里」，是因为城市就是一个包括我们周围一切的世界。作为一个摄影爱好者，我每去到一座城市，都希望能够使用手中的相机去记录这座城市下这座城市独特的一面，但是也常常遇到一些挑战和难题。在拍摄过程中，我也积累了一些经验和教训。在这里，我将尝试从最初的拍摄想法构建开始再到拍摄过程，和大家分享一下我的城市摄影记录流程。

来到一座城市，第一件要干的事情不是拿起相机四处寻找可以拍摄的景点。请先放下一切让你觉得累赘的东西吧！随处逛逛，感受下城市的气息。放空自己，纯粹地观察眼前城市的一切。这座城市的道路是宽阔还是狭窄？空气中飘荡的味道是怎样的？这片街区流行什么色调？道路边种植的什么植物？建筑物是什么颜色和风格？我们对于城市的理解往往就会在这个过程中一点点地累积起来。
不同城市有着自己的风格，不同的人参观同一座城市也可能有不同印象。试试闭上眼睛，尝试概括一下城市带给你什么样的印象？不一定是某个抽象的词语，可以具体到某个物件或者某个特别的场景。
我来说说我对于一些城市的印象吧。
广州
是点心蒸笼上方氤氲的热气，是晚上巷子里趟拢门里飘出来电视节目和剁肉饼的声音。
广州 恩宁路
上海
是思南路两旁一眼看不到尽头的梧桐，是走在老公寓楼梯上的「吱呀吱呀」的声音。

北京
是一位老爷爷对着结冰的未名湖面朗诵诗歌，是故宫里的红墙黄瓦。

南京

城市风格通过特定的场景和物件来体现，游走在城市中，慢慢感受城市的温度，培养对城市风格的触觉非常重要。因为在街拍时，一切都在瞬息万变，并不会有一位耐心的模特等你构图，对焦，按下快门。你永远无法预知自己即将会面对什么情况。但是一般来说，你所想要表达的氛围和感情却是基…</span>

My favorite thing recently? The days are getting longer.
On our way to dinner tonight at 5:30p we were driving along and it was still light out! 
Then we got to sit inside at one of our favorite restaurants, and noted that we hadn’t been inside of the restaurant for two years. We’ve had takeout, and eaten many meals in the car in the parking lot, but tonight we actually got to sit down at a table inside. 
It was delightful.

Example 1:

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
To solve the question click here:(https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
The new thing that I learned in this question is about comparator interface in java. Using a comparator, we can sort the elements based on data members. For instance, it may be on roll no, name, age, or anything else.
In this question, I used comparator to sort the intervals according to the 1st interval.
Arrays.sort(intervals,(o1,o2)-&gt;{

                    <span>A great way to level up any application your building is to create a simple loading animation. Today, we&#x27;re going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.
Of course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we&#x27;re going to worry about creating the actual spinner!

For this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).
We start with just a very simple structure in our html.

  


Tip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.
To create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we&#x27;ll create a keyframe animation called spin:
 @keyframes spin {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
   100% {
     transform: rotate(360deg);
   }
 }

Now, let&#x27;s style our actual spinner!

We created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:
 .spinner {
   height: 100vh;
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
 }

Now, for the actual image:
 .img {
   height: 150px;
   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;
 }

Now we have a working spinner!

Node js is a popular backend nowadays! It&#x27;s fast and easy to write code. If you already know javascript, it can be easy to write node js. So we&#x27;re going to explore express js today with MongoDB for the database. We&#x27;ll create the rest API endpoints and implement CRUD operation for the to-do list. The example is quite basic, but we&#x27;re going to make a good project structure so that you can follow it for your other projects too! Let&#x27;s dive in -

In other words, HTTP is a method of sending messages from one program to another using the internet. 
In this article, I&#x27;ll cover HTTP terms, tools, and the structure of HTTP messages. I use analogies and metaphors, and explain things in multiple ways to try and provide helpful mental models. I&#x27;m currently working on A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to HTTP - Part 2: an App and a Server, in which I&#x27;ll dig into how to write the code to generate HTTP messages. After that, in A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to HTTP - Part 3: APIs, we&#x27;ll have a little fun with our app and some free to use APIs that other people have built for us.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s first see what Types are in Typescript.


Types are the easy way to refer the different properties and functions available to a value in the Typescript Code.
For eg: A vehicle of type Bike had certain properties such as two wheels whereas a vehicle of type Car has four wheels in general.
It is the code we add to the Typescript to make the compiler aware of the type of values variable will refer to.
let age : number &#x3D; 20;
let name: string &#x3D; &quot;Himanshu&quot;;
let isAdult: boolean &#x3D; true;

In the example above, we explicitly tell the typescript compiler that the variable age will be of type number, name will be of type string and isAdult would be of type boolean.
let likes : number &#x3D; 100;
let title: string &#x3D; &quot;Type Annotations and Inference&quot;
let isPublished : boolean &#x3D; true;

In this article, we are going to use what we&#x27;ve learned about HTML so far to create a portfolio, which you can use to tell the world about you and your projects. Without further ado, let&#x27;s get started.
First, create a work folder. This is what I did:

Everything related to the portfolio is inside the Portfolio directory. You can do this differently, but remember to be organized because we are going to add quite a few things in the future.
Next, go to Portfolio and create an HTML file. Let&#x27;s call it &quot;portfolio.html&quot;. Open it with a text editor, you can use the notepad that comes with your operating system if you want, but I recommend using a proper code editor like VS Code.

There have been many posts written about what is a Developer Advocate and many twitter spaces on how to get into DevRel so I won&#x27;t go into that in this post but link and embed some great resources at the end of the post that will help you if you are looking to get into DevRel or have just started your role as a Developer Advocate and don&#x27;t know where to start.
In this post I am going to share a bit about what I do as a Developer Advocate and what I love about it but it doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to have all these skills to be a Developer Advocate because
everyone is different and everyone brings different skills to the table.

                    <span>Introduction


In HTML, if you want a textbox with some initial text you wrap text inside the textarea tag like this  Hello World , this is fully editable, but if you try this in react you will get an error. Trying to use the defaultValue prop in react won&#x27;t work either. if you add a value prop to the textarea the value of the text will be displayed but then it won&#x27;t be editable, this is because the value prop is immutable.
Passing a value prop to textarea like this  , will display the text Hello World on the textbox, but it won&#x27;t be editable to make it editable we need to pass the a state to the value prop and update that state with the onChange prop like the code below.
import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

function TextBox () {

    const [text, setText] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;Hello World&#x27;);

   return (
            setText(e.target.value) }&gt;
          
         );

}

export default TextBox;


Inside the TextBox component, I initialize the text state with &#x27;Hello World&#x27; and passed it to the textarea as a value prop, this will be the initial text displayed in the text area. onChange&#x3D;{(e) &#x3D;&gt; setText(e.target.value) } this line of code updates the text state, with the new value.

console.log(count++)


....it&#x27;s...

0


 
The pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increment (or decrement) their operand by 1, and the value of the expression is the resulting incremented (or decremented) value.
Let&#x27;s look at what&#x27;s going on &quot;under the hood&quot;.
Here is a representation using a JavaScript class object.
postAdd &#x3D; {count++}
class Counter {
  constructor (){
    this.count &#x3D; 0
  }
  postAdd(){
    let oldCount &#x3D; this.count;
    this.count+&#x3D;1;
    return oldCount
  }
  preAdd(){
    this.count +&#x3D; 1;
    return this.count
  }
}

let count &#x3D; new Counter();

console.log(count.postAdd()) // 0

console.log(count.preAdd()) // 2 (the first console.log still increments!!!)


{variable}++ can be used when you don&#x27;t reference the increased variable in that function call and ++{variable} is useful when you need to reference the incremented variable immediately. -Zach Stone
Technically, pre incrementent is also faster since it is not creating a new variable each time.

                    <span>Object-oriented programming is a programming paragdigm that relies on the concept og objects. 
They are three types of methods in python:
Instance method
Class methed
Static method
Instance method is the most comman type of method used in python class. To call an instance method, you need to create an object of the class and with the help of that object you can access instance method.
On other hand, both class method and static method can be accessed directly by using class name i.e without creating object of class. Though you can also access these methods using object of a class.
Class and Static methods have some basic differences. Let&#x27;s have a look over the difference between class and static method.
A class method is a method which bounds to class rather than object or instance of the …</span>

                    <span>最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。
但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。

一、带宽进化的历史
我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。
56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。

我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。
后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。
21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。

ADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。
2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。

从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。
二、家庭的入户带宽
现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。

                    <span>5 年后，Slackware 发布大变样的 15.0

Slackware 是最古老的仍在维护的 Linux 发行版。它的上个版本是 2016 年发布的 14.2。作为一个古老的发行版在五年后发布的 版本，这个版本中有了大幅变化：提供了 5.15.19 LTS 内核；采用 PipeWire 替代了 PulseAudio；X11 之外还提供了 Wayland；用 Qt5 替换了 Qt4；采用 PAM 替代了纯 shadow 密码方式；Postfix 默认替换了 Sendmail；Dovecot 替换了老的 imapd 和 ipop3d；elogind 替换了 ConsoleKit2；带有 Rust 和 Python 3；独有的包管理器 pkgtools 有了很大改进；桌面环境提供了 Xfce 4.16 和最新的 Plasma 5；主要的编译器是 gcc-11.2 和 llvm 13.0；默认浏览器是 Firefox 91.5esr。并且，完全没有 systemd。


老王点评：简直是一夜之间告别过去，重新粉饰新家。明天我们或许会详细解读一下。




一半的英特尔芯片漏洞是员工内部发现的

英特尔在其 年度安全报告 中指出，在 2021 年发现的 226 个 CVE 漏洞中，有一半是英特尔员工在内部发现的，其余 113 个 CVE 中，有 86% 是通过他们的 Bug Bounty 计划从外部发现的。77% 的漏洞存在于硬件/固件中，70% 的英特尔软件安全问题是外部研究人员发现的。漏洞最多的产品是他们的图形硬件/驱动程序，其次是以太网产品和其他软件。最后，他们将 CVE 数量与 AMD 进行比较，英特尔在 2021 年称其 CPU 只有 10 个 CVE，而 AMD 共有 31 个；在图形类方面，AMD 在这一年有 27 个 CVE，而英特尔有 51 个。


老王点评：虽然这些年英特尔 CPU 出现了许多严重漏洞，但是看起来他们还是相当重视的。




Mozilla 关闭了其 VR 浏览器 Firefox Reality

这个开源浏览器允许用户通过单独的 VR 和 AR 头盔访问网络，用户可以访问标准的 URL，进行搜索，并最终在 2D 网站和沉浸式网络体验之间移动。Mozilla 解释 说，它决定关闭 Firefox Reality 的原因是计划将该技术放到其他社区和组织中，这样它就可以“像 WebAssembly、Rust 和 Servo 一样继续发展并为网络作出贡献。”


老王点评：在这个元宇宙大热的时间，Mozilla 却砍掉了其开源的 VR 浏览器，这是对自己的产品能力没有信心吗？</span>

                    <span>这并不是微软所承诺的……但也不全是坏事。




2007 年 1 月 30 日，也就是 15 年前，一再延期的 Windows Vista 发布了。

我们可以尽情地谈论 Vista 有多糟糕、人们有多讨厌它。它是有史以来最不受欢迎的版本之一，与 Windows ME 一样。但是，你今天运行的随便哪个现代 Windows，它都是 Vista 的后裔。

Vista 并没有微软像 2000 年承诺的那样，Windows “Whistler” 将合并 Windows 9x 和 Windows NT：这变成了 XP，每个人都记得 XP —— 基本上都是怀念。Windows Blackcomb 是 XP 的计划中的继任者。它从未面世。我们得到的是 Windows Longhorn。

Blackcomb 将有一个新的编程模型、一个新的用户界面，以及一个新的数据库驱动的存储引擎，“WinFS”……但它被延期了，然后被删除，最后被取消。

谈论 Vista 到底是什么更有意思。摆上货架的是技术上更保守的东西。

它有用户访问控制（UAC）：那些恼人的弹出式信息不断要求获得你的许可。（这实际上是微软意识到大部分的 Windows 机器都是独立的，没有连接到域。）

它有一个 3D 合成的用户界面，“Aero”，带有透明效果，尽管这确实使它变得有点慢。而当 Windows 7 推出时，人们很喜欢它 —— 所以微软将它从 Windows 8 中剥离了。（指的是外观，而不是合成过程；那仍然存在）。

它有一个包含“小部件”的侧边栏，这在 Windows 11 中又出现了。

尽管它在五年前就被干掉了，但 Vista 是 Windows 7 的基础。Vista 是 NT 的第 6 版；而 Windows 7 则是 Windows NT 6.1。

Windows 7 是经过调整的 Vista，响应速度更快。Windows 8 则是 Vista 2：是 Vista 的平板电脑版（它实际上相当不错）。

困难在于，人们已经习惯了台式机和鼠标，所以开始按钮又被迅速恢复了。Windows 8.1 则是 Vista 2.1。

Windows 10 是 Vista 3，Metro 现代应用程序被搁置，桌面应用程序再次成为中心。现在，Windows 11 删除了所有那些讨厌的、复杂的、混乱的东西，如垂直侧边栏。

Vista 是微软放弃其花哨的技术野心而开始简化事物的时候。现在有远见的人已经离开了。Surface 并没有彻底改变这个行业，它只是疏远了 OEM 厂商。

15 年过去了，微软仍在对 Vista 进行迭代。

                    <span>Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是离线学习和新的教育应用程序，为学校和学生提供帮助。




Zorin OS 16 是 2021 年最令人印象深刻的发行版之一。你或许想先了解一下 Zorin OS 16 和 Zorin OS 16 精简版 的信息。

现在，经过一段时间，Zorin OS 团队终于决定发布 Zorin OS 16 教育版。

可以预期包含 Zorin OS 16 的所有改进，以及为教育而量身定做的具体修改。

请注意，教育版的 Zorin OS 16 是完全免费下载的。对于旧电脑，你还可以使用精简教育版。

Zorin OS 16 教育版有什么新内容？

Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是以离线为先的学习体验。换句话说，它包括一个合格的教育内容集，不需要上网就可以访问。

为了实现这一目标，Zorin OS 16 包括了 Kolibri，这是一个自由开源的教育解决方案，支持自定进度的学习，并通过本地 Wi-Fi 网络进行同步/共享。

因此，即使没有互联网，你也可以依靠点对点的连接来分享教育内容，进行协作，并继续学习，不受任何干扰。

学校管理者还可以创建自己的课程，并从可汗学院、Open Stax、麻省理工学院等来源下载现成的资源。

当然，管理员需要互联网接入才能做到这一点。但是，一旦你下载了内容，就可以在没有互联网接入的情况下轻松地在本地网络上分享，从而使分发教育内容成为可能。

除了 Kolibri 之外，Zorin OS 16 还出炉了新的教育应用程序，其中一些是：

Minder：将想法和笔记可视化



与 Obsidian 和 Logseq 类似，Minder 是一个更简单有效的思维导图工具，帮助你将笔记和想法可视化，而进行头脑风暴会议。

Foliate：电子书阅读器



Foliate 是一个令人印象深刻的 Linux 电子书阅读器应用。它应该能让学生/教师提高阅读体验，也能在需要时提供公共领域书籍的下载。

OpenBoard：交互式白板



我最近报道了 OpenBoard，作为我们的应用亮点之一。它是一个自由开源的白板，应该会让老师和学生也感到有趣。

OpenBoard 应该有助于通过工具以及应用程序与多媒体内容互动的能力来改善学习过程。

Minuet：音乐教学

Minuet 专注于帮助你向学生教授音乐。你会发现视觉队列，以及和弦、音阶等方面的练耳练习。

其他改进措施

根据你的系统配置，可以选择 Zorin OS 16 教育版或 Zorin OS 16 精简教育版。

这两个教育版应该会带来更快、更漂亮的桌面体验，可以访问更多的应用程序。

Zorin OS 16 教育版支持到 2025 年 4 月。

你可以从其官方网站下载 Zorin OS 16 教育版及其精简版。

上一篇文章的Activity视图里面可以看得出，DecorView是activity窗口的根视图，每个activity都对应一个窗口window，这个窗口是PhoneWindow的实例，PhoneWindow对应的布局是DecorView，是一个FrameLayout，DecorView内部又分为两部分，一部分是ActionBar，另一部分是ContentParent，即activity在setContentView对应的布局。

DecorView的初始化
先从创建的MainActivity看，在onCreate方法中首先调用的是setContentView方法
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
}

MainActivity的父类是AppCompatActivity 的方法，最终会调用 AppCompatDelegateImpl 的 setContentView 方法：
// AppCompatDelegateImpl  
public void setContentView(int resId) {
    this.ensureSubDecor(); 
    ViewGroup contentParent &#x3D; (ViewGroup)this.mSubDecor.findViewById(16908290);
    contentParent.removeAllViews();

👉  万字长文 Flutter 运行机制白皮书
前面的几篇文章基本上把 Flutter 的三棵树说明白了，从三棵树的含义到三棵树的关联，从 Element 的更新到 Render 的布局。有了这些铺垫，再看 Flutter 的其他机制就更加清晰。
有人可能会问，这三棵树除了 Widget 之外，其他的离我们开发好远，看这些对我们开发有什么帮助吗？
我从下面几点来给大家抛砖引玉。
可以更好的看 Flutter 源码
Flutter framework 的源码大概分为五层：

Widgets 这一层将所有的机制都封装进了我们熟悉的 Widget 中，比如 ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget 封装了动画，CustomPaint 封装了绘制，GestureDetector 封装了手势机制等等。
开发过程中，免不了要追到源码中对比实现效果。前面我们知道 Widget 基本分为下面的几类，每一类都有基本的代码追踪策略。
StatelessWidget 代码追踪
StatelessWidget 是组合型的无状态 Widget，在build 方法中构造出子树。其对应的 Element 是 StatelessElement
此类型的 Widget，在显示层我们只需要关注其 build 方法，看构造的子树是谁。
以万金油的 Container 组件为例。
@override
Widget build(BuildContex…</span>

数据类
与Java等语言不同，kotlin创建只包含数据的类时，需要在类名前声明关键字：data。
data class KotlinBean (val brand : String)

在kotlin中，编译器会自动的从主构造函数中根据所有声明的属性提取以下函数：
· equals()
· hashCode()
· toString()
· componentN() functions (对应于属性，按声明顺序排列)
· copy()
如果这些函数已经在类中被明确定义了，或者从超类中继承而来，就不再会生成。不是所有的kotlin类都能声明为数据类，一般数据类声明都要满足以下条件：
· 主构造函数至少包含一个或多个参数；
· 所有的主构造函数的参数必须标识为val或var；
· 数据类不可声明为abstract，open，sealed或者inner；
· 数据类不能继承其他类(但是可以实现接口)。
Copy()
望词生意，此方法作用就是复制，我们可以使用该函数复制对象并修改部分属性，比如对于上面的KotlinBean类，实现类似下面示例：
fun copy(brand: String &#x3D; this.brand) &#x3D; KotlinBean(brand)

需要修改数据类的属性时用copy()，示例：
data class KotlinBean (val brand : String)

fun main(args: Array) {
    val jack &#x3D; KotlinBean(brand &#x3D; &quot;Jack&quot;)
    val olderJack &#x3D; jack.copy(brand &#x3D; &quot;olderJack&quot;)
    println(jack)
    println(olderJack)…</span>

📢前言

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第69天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：赎金信
给定一个赎金信 (ransom) 字符串和一个杂志(magazine)字符串，判断第一个字符串 ransom 能不能由第二个字符串 magazines 里面的字符构成。如果可以构成，返回 true ；否则返回 false。
(题目说明：为了不暴露赎金信字迹，要从杂志上搜索各个需要的字母，组成单词来表达意思。杂志字符串中的每个字符只能在赎金信字符串中使用一次。)
示例1:
输入：ransomNote &#x3D; &quot;a&quot;, magazine &#x3D; &quot;b&quot;
输出：false

示例2:
输入：ransomNote &#x3D; &quot;aa&quot;, magazine &#x3D; &quot;ab&quot;
输出：false

示例 3：
输入：ransomNote &#x3D; &quot;aa&quot;, magazine &#x3D; &quot;aab&quot;
输出：true

提示：
你可以假设两个字符串均只含有小写字母。
🌻C#方法：数组存储
利用数组储存字母出现次数，然后进行比较即可得出结果！
代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool CanConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        int[] alphabets &#x3D; new int[26];
        char[] m &#x3D; magazine.ToCharArray(), r &#x3D; ransomNote.ToCharArray();
        foreach (char c in m) {
            alphabets[c - &#x27;a&#x27;]++;
        }
        foreach (char c in r) {
            if (alphabets[c - &#x27;a&#x27;] !&#x3D; 0) alphabets[c - &#x27;a&#x27;]--;
            else return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：76 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了79.50%的用户
内存消耗：42.4 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了5.50%的用户

🌻Java 方法：数组存储
思路解析
使用a和b两个数组分别存储ransomNote和magazine每个字符出现的次数，
如果a里面每个字符出现的次数都小于等于b里面的
则判断为true，如果有一个大于b的则返回false
这样就可以完成需求啦！
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        int[] a &#x3D; new int[26];
        int[] b &#x3D; new int[26];
        char[] aChar &#x3D; ransomNote.toCharArray();
        char[] bChar &#x3D; magazine.toCharArray();
        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i  b[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：1 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了90.26%的用户
内存消耗：45.2 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了8.05%的用户

前言
电子邮件(email）是一种传统的互联网沟通和交流方式，目前仍在办公场所广泛使用。最近在负责一款邮件客户端APP的开发工作，接触到了一些邮件相关的代码和知识，抽时间就整理了一下邮件开发相关的开源库和资源。
正文
首先明确一下，邮箱从使用协议/类别上大致可以分为两种：
标准的IMAP/SMTP邮箱，如GMail、Outlook、Yahoo、QQ、163等邮箱。
Exchange，即Microsoft Exchange Server，是微软公司推出的邮件服务器，如Exchange 2010。应用程序可以使用EWS(Exchange Web Service)来访问Exchange服务器上的邮件、日程、联系人等。
mailcore2
MailCore2是一个用C语言编写的邮件协议封装库，能够运行在iOS、Android、Mac、Windows和Linux平台上，支持SMTP、IMAP、POP3、MIME和HTML消息渲染。MailCore2 API的调用都是异步的，即操作都在子线程中进行，不会阻塞当前主线程。
MailCore 2 provide a simple and asynchronous API to work with e-mail protocols IMAP, POP and SMTP. The API has been redesigned from ground up.
GitHub:
https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2
很多第三方邮件客户端收发邮件都是基于MailCore2开发的，如小巧精致，超高颜值的开源项目Mailspring

                    <span>TL;DR 太长不看

Vim 是强大高效灵活优雅的文本编辑器；
使用 Vim 是复利投资，也是有趣的探索；
所有常见操作系统都有 Vim，你的电脑里可能已经预装了它；
Vim 有无数强大插件可以提升你的编辑效率；
要开始使用 Vim，掌握几个基本功能就够了；
唯一需要的，是不断尝试、总结、改进的练习心态；

Vim 的最小必要知识

Vim 用户的最高理想，是以思考的速度编辑文本。也许没有人能真正实现这一理想，但是有些人的确很接近。
Vim 是世界上寿命最长的软件之一，至今已有 30 年历史，而且还在持续改进中。它的灵感之源是 Bill Joy 在上世纪七十年代所写的 vi，而 vi 的前身是伴随着 Unix 诞生的 ed。Vim，就是「Vi IMproved」。
使用 Vim 时无需鼠标。Vim 支持鼠标，但是 Vim 用户嫌弃鼠标拖慢了他们的速度。
Vim 有庞大的用户社区，是编辑器大战的阵营之一。另一方是 Emacs，第三方是其他所有编辑器：「编辑器之神」和「神之编辑器」，以及其它。
Vim 和其他常见文本编辑器的根本区别是「模式」。Vim 可以在几种模式中切换，但同一时间只能处于一种模式。大部分时候，Vim 处于「普通」(Normal) 模式。在这种模式下，按下键盘上的某个键将会触发一个命令，而不是把对应的字符显示在屏幕上。这是最困扰 Vim 初级使用者的。
Vim 有一个深刻洞察（从 vi 继承来的）：无论我们写程序、写小说，或者只是写个简单的说明书，花在修改上的时间总比花在写作上的时间多；而修改时花费时间最多的，是移动光标、选择或删除需要修改的对象。
Vim 有一个优雅设计（也是从 vi 继承来的）：文本结构化。一篇文章包括一个或多个段，每段包括一个或多个句子，一个句子包括一个或多个词，这些都是可以单独编辑的文本对象。程序代码也是如此，一对引号、一对括号、一对…</span>

                    <span>这篇记录自己LOFT装修的文章其实很久前就想写的，结果一拖再拖已经拖到入住房子两年了，趁着虎年春节假期事情相对少些才想起动笔。也好，入住两年，房子逐渐更加丰富些，也有些更多切身的感受可以分享，算是自己这一路以来的回顾和思考。想到哪儿写哪儿，会夹杂很多自己的感受甚至感悟，希望能以最真实的第一视角给有DIY装修想法的朋友一些信心和启发吧。
装修确实是个系统性工程，很多环节都可以展开介绍，但碍于篇幅有的会是一笔带过，第一次发文章，还是希望先把这个装修历程的环节都覆盖到，很多环节如果有机会可以后续再展开介绍。
大家也可以通过我的微博（@Dupleix）联络到我，除了装修之外，会记录些生活日常、效率工具、投资工作日常、越野跑、骑行、美食等话题...
〇、引子
先自我介绍啰嗦一下，作为为什么后来想自己设计、装修房子的铺垫。
90年，男，小时候学过点素描后浅尝辄止，这也是仅有的能和室内设计/装修扯上关系的技能了，但自认为头脑里还算有不少艺术细菌的，尤其比较喜欢建筑设计。高中无聊时喜欢看些杂七杂八的书，无意见看到一本关于安藤忠雄的画册，当时就很希望以后有机会能成为一名建筑师，黑白照片里灰白头发模样冷冷酷酷不苟言笑的那种。
高考的时候也是完全自己报的志愿想学建筑。因为人在帝都当时也有些青春期叛逆，不想离家里太近，所以“建筑老四校”里清华、天大很早就排除了1，剩下的东南、同济相比，自己更喜欢东南的底蕴，毕竟是国立中央大学亲儿子，老校区里古朴的建筑也是看了照片爱的不行，所以高考时候自己第一志愿直接写的东南建筑。北京是考前报志愿，自己的成绩当时还尚可，莽撞冲动的少年一模、二模后看了以往的分数线还是觉得东南建筑是比较稳的，所以高三里甚至高考前很大一部分时间是看各种建筑史的书籍/和学校里韩国人踢球/愣神儿憧憬即将到来的美好大学时光这种迷惑行为。
结果不出所料是骄兵必败，虽然进了东南，但没有达到建筑系的…</span>

10 分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
「和危险的动物接触」之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需…</span>

祝「光字片」，涅槃重生！

@潘誉晗 ：故事围绕着北方某城市「光字片」里一户周姓人家展开。七十年代末，为了响应国家的号召，父亲前往西南参加「大三线」的建设；长子则成为第一批下乡的知青；长女周蓉生性喜欢浪漫，偷偷前往心上人所在的贵州乡村下乡。不如哥哥姐姐般优秀的老幺，则在家中与母亲相依为命。之后五十年，他们的故事将与祖国发展紧紧相连。
那边的《开端》迎来了开年「第一炸」，这边的《人世间》也我们献上了中国普通老百姓的生活史。剧集改编自梁晓声同名小说，电视剧版汇聚了强大的阵容。由曾执导过《人民的名义》的李路导演，旁白由陈道明担任，主演则有雷佳音、辛柏青、宋佳等演技派的演员。在时…</span>

With game publishing becoming increasingly consolidated, Google has apparently changed tactics. A new report claims almost all of Google&#x27;s work on Stadia revolves around licensing the technology. If true, Stadia&#x27;s days as a consumer-facing platform are numbered.

                    <span>Using a websocket server is a great way to speed up your applications. APIs inherently come with their own HTTP overhead, which means every time you call an API, you have to wait a little bit for the HTTP response.
This is mostly fine, but if you have an application with a lot of time sensitive and frequent server requests, it can become a problem. A good example of this is a chat app, where you need to see what the other person is saying immediately. APIs can still work in this scenario, but it&#x27;s not the best solution for the job.
In this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up a websocket server in Vue.JS, using a websocket server built in Node.JS and express. Keep reading for more. I&#x27;ve also written another tutorial on how to create a websocket server in Express and Javascript here.…</span>

                    <span>Before going into what Git and Github is, lets go over version control systems and it&#x27;s appliction to the tech space. VCS is short for Version control system, it is a Version management system that tracks changes in files along with the order in which the changes to these files were made.

Git is an example of a Version control system (VCS), it allows you track all versions of your work and stored as repositories or repos for short. Github is different from Git, but since they are used side by side it is often confused for Git. Github is more like a shared hosting platform for all repositories and applies Git for effective collaboration within organizations and developers. Git hub provides good features for collaboration, one of this features is forking.

                    <span>Introduction


This is part of the UI Kit with React, TypeScript, Storybook and Tailwind, make sure you&#x27;ve checked out the previous entries in the series if you find anything confusing 😊.
In this series I aim to implement a basic text field and integrate it with Storybook.
Let&#x27;s start off by creating what&#x27;s necessary for the text field. I want my text field to support the basics of a simple text-input field. It should support being disabled, having a placeholder and so on. On top of that I want it to integrate with react-hook-form as that is one of my favorite form libraries for React.
In the end, I want it to look like this:

In the project, create the files:
src/components/TextField/TextField.tsx
src/stories/TextField/TextField.stories.tsx
First, we&#x27;ll create the necessary structure for…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s take a look at (what I think) is going to be one of the coolest parts of the upcoming React 18 release: startTransition. 
In a nutshell, startTransition is a new API in React 18 that&#x27;s going to allow us to keep our applications interactive and responsive, even while big updates are happening behind the scenes. Previously, if a user was to initiate an action that would trigger a component to update – such as a search that fetches a ton of new data to display – the whole page would just kind of hang while all that loading stuff was happening. This, as you can imagine, feels kind of awkward to users, so as developers we were forced to find other ways around it – skeleton UIs to make loads feel faster, debouncing, setTimeouts, etc. 
In React, all updates are rendered equally urgently – o…</span>

                    <span>Note: This is the first part of a 3 part series in which we&#x27;ll understand the transform property of CSS.
In this part, we&#x27;ll understand the value &#x27;rotate&#x27; of the transform property.
The transform property is most commonly used in animations as it allows us to do a ton of things such as moving an element, scaling it, rotating it etc.
There are 5 types of &quot;rotate&quot; in the transform property:
1. transform: rotate();
2. transform: rotateX();
3. transform: rotateY();
4. transform: rotateZ();
5. transform: rotate3d;

Let&#x27;s understand them one by one by applying these values on the below👇code:

Sharing Access, a non profit based in West Philly, and working on converting the surplus (5 million pounds) food that is often thrown out or goes to waste in one way or another and delivering that to local nonprofits and food pantries. 
They are approaching this problem in a unique way using open source using React to managing the operations in a PWA. 
The non-profit ecosystem in the USA is a $390 billion (based on 2016 numbers), but despite number operations and technical help can be lacking in the web interactions.

                    <span>AI 参加编程竞赛，成绩超过了一半的程序员

DeepMind 刚刚宣布了其最新打造的 AlphaCode 编程 AI。它参加了 Codeforces 的编程挑战，这是一个极具挑战性的编程平台，通过类似于国际象棋的 Elo 评级系统来分享每周问题和相关排名。最终 AlphaCode 针对 Codeforces 网站上 5000 名用户解决的十个挑战项目开展了测试，且拿下了平均名次位于前 54.3% 的成绩。DeepMind 估计该系统的 Codeforces Elo 为 1238，位居过去 6 个月在该网站上发起挑战的用户榜单的前 28% 。


老王点评：看来至少有一半的程序员可以考虑改行了。




树莓派操作系统发布 64 位版本

虽然 2016 年发布的树莓派 3 及后来的产品已经带有 64 位 CPU，甚至树莓派 Zero 2 也具有 64 位功能，但官方提供的树莓派操作系统一直是 32 位的。不过，64 位的操作系统可以支持更多内存，较新的指令集也有性能优势，此外，一些基于 Arm 的商业/二进制分发软件只支持 AArch64，因此树莓派基金会决定提供 64 位的树莓派操作系统。


老王点评：终于升级到 64 位了，虽然之前可以使用其他的 64 位操作系统。




Oracle Linux 出现在 Windows 商店

Oracle Linux 8.5 是 CentOS 8.5 的衍生发行版，以 WSL 的形式出现在 Windows 商店，这是红帽家族的发行版 首次 出现在 Windows 商店，尽管 Oracle Linux 不是红帽的。在 Windows 商店中，如果你搜索 Linux，你会发现 Ubuntu、SUSE/openSUSE、Debian、Kali、Alpine 等等，这都是为 WSL 开发的。但你不会看到 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL 之类的红帽系的 Linux，虽然有人为 WSL 中制作了 Fedora remix。


老王点评：我就说 Oracle Linux 是叛徒，对吧。</span>

                    <span>Nitrux 2.0.0 是一个令人兴奋的版本，它默认采用 XanMod 内核，并 带来了其他各种视觉和技术改进。




Nitrux Linux 轻松成为了 最漂亮的 Linux 发行版 之一。

上个月，我们点评了 Maui Shell，它也是由 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队所设计的。现在，Nitrux 2.0.0 已经发布，并带来了一些令人兴奋的变化。

让我在这里重点介绍一下基本变化。

Nitrux 2.0.0 有什么新东西？

这次升级包括一个新的 Linux 内核、更新的应用程序、桌面环境、固件改进，以及大大减小了 ISO 的大小。

你还会注意到布局和顶部面板等几处细微视觉变化。

XanMod 内核 5.16.3



XanMod 内核是为新一代硬件量身定做的，以获得尽可能好的桌面体验。

与许多其他 Linux 发行版中自带的 Linux 内核相比，你会发现它有一些自定义设置和新功能，可以提高你的使用体验。

在 Nitrux 2.0.0 中，默认选择了 XanMod 内核 5.16.3。当然你仍然可以选择最新的主线 LTS 或非 LTS（5.15.17、5.16.3）Linux 内核。

别忘了，如果你需要，你还可以安装 Liquorix 和 Libre 内核。

更新布局和面板的变化

顶部面板现在显示了窗口控制、标题、全局菜单和系统托盘区。

布局仍然与以前的版本相似，但有一些位置的调整，比如将应用程序菜单添加到基座dock中，应用程序菜单是 Launchpad Plasma（感谢 adhe）。



此外，你应会发现窗口装饰有了改进，所有窗口现在默认都是无边框的。你可以在外观设置下的窗口装饰选项中选择禁用无边框窗口模式。

可选的 Latte 布局也得到了更新，包括窗口控制、标题栏和全局菜单。

更新的软件包和驱动程序

出于显而易见的原因，这次升级包括 KDE Plasma 版本更新、KDE 框架、KDE 装备，以及其他必要的应用程序，如 Firefox 和 LibreOffice。

此外，为 AMD GPU 增加了内核软件包中没有的额外固件。他们还在可下载的 ISO 中增加了 i915、Nouveau 和 AMDGPU 驱动。

默认使用的是 MESA 21.3.5 稳定版，但如果你需要的话，可以安装最新的 MESA 22.0。

其他改进

在 Nitrux Linux 的这些变化之外，还有一些额外的技术改进，如：


减少了标准版和精简版的 ISO 文件大小。

Xbox One 控制器的工作原理与操纵杆没有冲突。

在精简版 ISO 中，JWM 取代了 i3 窗口管理器。


更多细节，你可以参考 官方公告。

今天 Dart  2.16 跟随 Flutter 2.10 正式发布，它不包含新的语言特性，但有一堆错误修复（包括对安全漏洞的修复），改进了 Dart 包在特定平台的支持，以及 pub.dev 的全新搜索体验。
Dart 2.16
今天与 Flutter 2.10 一起发布的 Dart 2.16 SDK 继续从传统的 Dart CLI 工具（dartfmt、dartdoc 等）过渡到新的组合 dart 开发工具，新的弃用工具是 dartdoc( use dart doc) 和 dartanalyzer (use dart analyze)。
在 Dart 2.17 中我们计划完全删除 dartdoc、dartanalyzer 和 pub 命令（在 Dart 2.15 中已弃用；使用 dart pub 或者 flutter pub）。有关详细信息请参阅#46100。
2.16 版本还包括了一个安全漏洞的修复和两个小的重大更改：
dart:io  中的 HttpClient API  允许为 authorization、www-authenticate、cookie 和 cookie2 设置可选标头，Dart 2.16 之前的 SDK 中重定向逻辑的实现存在一个漏洞，当跨域重定向发生时，这些 headers（可能包含敏感信息）会被传递，在 Dart 2.16 中这些 headers 被删除了。
dart:io 中的 Directory.rename API 已更改了在 Windows 上的行为：它不再删除与目标名称匹配的现有目录（#47653）。

自从推出 Flutter 以来，我们一直专注于为漂亮的定制应用提供跨平台解决方案，这些应用被编译为机器代码并充分利用设备的底层图形硬件功能。
今天这一愿景有了新的重大突破，第一个支持 Windows 的版本发布了。

目前有近 50 万个应用程序正在使用 Flutter……
到目前为止，我们已经看到了超出我们预期的势头，现已有近 50 万个已经发布的应用使用了 Flutter，其中包括来自 Betterment、BMW 和 ByteDance 等公司的大型应用程序，以及来自 Google 三十个团队所开发的应用。
Statista和SlashData等分析师衡量，2021 年 Flutter 已经成为最受欢迎的跨平台 UI 工具包：

在 2021 年的所有四个季度调查中，始终有92% 的 Flutter 开发人员对我们的工具表示积极满意。（对于另外 8% 的人，我们正在倾听你的反馈）
在调研数据中一个常见的请求就是对 Windows 的支持。
今天，我们很高兴地宣布在稳定版本中全面支持 Windows 应用。
Window and Flutter
几年前我们为 Flutter 制定了一个雄心勃勃的愿景，即从 iOS 和 Android 上的移动应用扩展到括 Web 和 Desktop 平台。
Flutter 跨平台的核心是：便携、 Skia 图形引擎、Flutter 渲染系统、动画、主题、文本输入和国际化以及 Flutter 提供的数百个控件 。
但桌面应用不仅仅是在更大屏幕上运行的移动应用：
它还有专用的输入设备，例如键盘和鼠标，并且有可调整大小的窗口，通常在宽屏显示器上运；

欢迎来到 Flutter 2.10 稳定版本的更新，自上次发布至今还不到两个月，但即使在这么短的时间内，Flutter 2.10 也关闭了 1,843 个 issues，合并了来自全球 155 位贡献者的 1,525 个 PR，所以非常感谢大家这段时间出色的工作，尤其是在 2021 年假期期间。
作为此版本的重要组成部分，这里有几件令人兴奋的事情要宣布，包括：
Flutter 对 Windows 支持的重大更新；
一些关于性能方面的重大改进；
关于对框架中图标和颜色相关的新功能支持；
一些开发工具方便的改进；
此外还有一些关于移除 dev channel 的更新、减少对旧版 iOS 的支持以及简短的重要变更列表等等。
为 Windows 上的生产应用做好准备
首先，Flutter 2.10 版本给我们带来了稳定版本的 Windows 支持，现在开发者可以不再通过设置 flag 来启用 Windows 的支持，因为在 Flutter 2.10 上现在默认支持编译生成 Windows 应用

当然，此版本还包括对文本处理、键盘处理和键盘快捷键相关的改进，以及更好地和 Windows 进行集成，支持命令行参数，全球化多语言文本输入和辅助功能等等。
有关 Windows 稳定版发布的更多信息，请参阅Flutter for Windows 博客文章，该文章描述了 Flutter 在 Windows 上的架构实现，让你了解目前有多少 Flutter 包和插件已经支持 Windows，你还可以查看我们的工具和应用合作伙伴在 Windows 上使用 Flutter 所做的一些 Demo！

                    <span>就在最近几年，一到年底几乎所有的 app 都会推送一份年度总结。
可这样的年度总结并不能戳中我的心：首先，这是一份虚假的年度总结，推送时它的数据来源还不完整，尚且无法代表这一年（也有不少 app 会更新数据来源，支持反复查询）；其次，因为一些偶发事件导致年度总结有所偏颇，俗称「没法看」。
我在 2019 年补标了很多书影音，实际上并没有在这一年真正看过。这一随手补标导致豆瓣年度总结失去了真实性，也失去了分享的意义。同年，我开始了个人记录的数字化尝试，并有幸读到了一位豆瓣友邻「没脚鸟」的可视化总结 「2018 数据可视化总结」 ，由此开启了个人生活的数字化与可视化化表达的尝试。
几种数字化与可视化的尝试
生活记录的数字化不需要你拥有特殊的技能，它和写日记一样，最困难的地方在于坚持。我目前使用的工具是 Microsoft Excel，如果你是技术大佬，那可以为自己提供一些更方便的记录方式。目前可以用于生活记录数字化的 app 有很多，舍弃它们，但可以通过它们想一想自己需要记录的内容有哪一些。
我正在记录的数字化内容有四项：必要摄入、不健康摄入、心情和活动。必要摄入即一日三餐，不过一日四五餐和一日两餐时有发生；不健康摄入主要指酒精、咖啡和奶茶。
下面和大家分享一下我的记录方式与可视化结果，以及记录过程中犯下的种种错误。
必要摄入
必要摄入表头
这是必要摄入的表头，由于英语水平不佳，暂不展示完整单词，一天中我需要记录10个原始数据。

Date：日期；
SF：具体摄入，例如：包子、馄饨、三明治、寿喜锅、妈妈烧的饭等；
BS、LS、DS：摄入分类，例如：中式日常、中式地方、西式、日式等；
Lo.：地点，例如餐饮店、食堂、家等。

在正式记录开始之前，我列举了一部分可能的摄入分类和地点，避免后续统计过程中种类过于繁杂。如果出现一日两餐，则没有吃的那一顿用「/」表示，如果出现一日四五餐，…</span>

2022 年 2 月 4 日，「新冠疫情爆发后首届如期举办的奥运会」——北京 2022 年冬奥会（大名：「第 24 届冬季奥林匹克运动会」英文「XXIV Olympics Winter Games Beijing 2022」，简称「北京冬奥会」）在「鸟巢」（国家体育场）正式拉开帷幕。春节期间，应该也有不少读者通过电视和网络直播「围观」过开幕式和国家体育场主火炬塔点燃的瞬间。
为了帮助你更好地观看北京冬奥会的比赛，这份包含观赛平台、赛程表等的冬奥观赛补给包特地为你准备好，为你的冬奥观赛助一臂之力。
这届冬奥会到底在哪里举办？
虽说是「北京冬奥会」，但实际上是由北京市联手河北省张家口市，由北京赛区、延庆赛区和张家口赛区共三个赛区共同举办 。北京赛区主管速度滑冰、短道速滑、冰壶、冰球、花样滑冰等冰上项目以及单板和自由式滑雪大跳台等雪上项目；延庆赛区举办高山滑雪、雪橇、雪车和钢架雪车四个分项；张家口赛区则承办冬季两项、越野滑雪等雪上项目。
你知道上面的小图标代表哪些场馆吗？
闭环管理是啥？
由于疫情原因，北京冬奥组委决定对运动员、随队官员和其他利益方人员（包括志愿者、记者等）进行闭环管理。闭环管理就是境外来华的人员，从入境进入海关后开始体温筛查，经过核酸采样，然后直接通过专用的交通工具送到奥运村或签约酒店。每个奥运村和签约酒店，都是一个独立的闭环。从入境到抵离，交通、餐饮、住宿、训练、比赛，包括媒体的采访，形成了多个闭环点，通过交通工具在这些闭环点连线移动进行活动和工作，就是一个完整的闭环。这样做可以有效避免闭环外人员被可能的病例感染。

                    <span>前两天和朋友在街边走的时候，她说起自己前段时间赶DDL赶到「一觉醒来眼睛突然什么都看不清楚」，最后跑来跑去检查眼底的故事。当时我们走在瑟瑟北风中，恰好路过一所中学，朋友感叹：你说现在的小朋友，每天都在看手机看电脑，他们的眼睛怎么能保持不近视啊？
我附和：是啊是啊。又提出一个严峻问题：你说，我们小时候不看手机也不怎么看电脑，电视都看得不算多，我们的眼睛怎么早早坏掉的？
沉思后我们得出两个结论：一，我们的眼睛，是真不行。二，保护视力人人有责。尤其是在这个被电子屏幕围追堵截的时代，保持一双明亮的眼睛，真是太难了。
所以今天就来唠唠，我这个十五年近视患者为了保护自己的眼睛（虽然成效不佳），这些年在e-ink产品上走过的道儿。如果你也有买墨水屏产品的需求，也许可以看看这篇文章。

 

 
推荐指数：⭐️⭐️⭐️ 无功无过
推荐人群：以阅读出版书籍为主，无pdf和专业书籍的读者。
 
kindle应该是e-ink入门跳不过的一个坑。
kindle我用过两款，一台15年左右的基础版，没有背光（现在kindle最便宜的青春版都有背光了，真好），一台18年换的paperwhite3。
这两台功能上除了背光没有太大差异。虽然ppw3在参数上提升到了300ppi分辨率，肉眼也可以看出细微差距，但也没有到天差地别的地步。
这是我很喜欢kindle的一个点：在基础功能保证的前提下划分价格区间，即使是入门款也足以覆盖大部分需求。
而促使我冷落kindle的原因，和其硬件无关，主要是闭源系统带来的局限性。Amazon自带商城资源覆盖了绝大部分出版书、畅销书，但如果是专业书籍和一些古旧版本书籍，很难在商城中找到资源，且这些书籍很多只有pdf格式的影印版，而kindle的尺寸决定了它看PDF只有两个字的下场：
难用。

@黎明前线 Alan：微软海洋环保鼠标
在微软去年的 Surface 新品发布会之后，就一直对这个号称「环保」、由海洋回收塑料瓶制成的树脂材料蓝色鼠标印象深刻。去年年底终于得偿所愿，入手了这款微软海洋环保鼠标。

撇开同样被微软设计成为方便残障人士开启的环保鼠标包装盒（暂且先不考虑残障人士会不会买这款鼠标），就鼠标本身来讲，微软海洋环保鼠标其实是让我非常失望的：首先就是堪称渲染图诈骗的实际鼠标颜色：实际观感鼠标更加淡灰色，黑色颗粒也会更加明显（但手感上没有区别）。

上面就是官方渲染图 &amp; 实际颜色效果（我已经将室内光源调整至最冷的模式，仍然比官方渲染图中那个洁白无瑕的颜色深了不少）。以至于在上手这款鼠标之后有朋友嘲笑：「你的鼠标是买洗衣粉送的吗？」，我的第一反应其实是「这个形容太准确了！」。

这款鼠标的手感更不值一提：鼠标本身很小巧，重量适中，如果你的手掌像我一样足够大的话可以手本身不移动就覆盖到整片屏幕操作，不过鼠标材质本身质感基本于一般廉价塑料鼠标无异，如果它的配色是纯黑色我的心理预期价位可能只有 ¥50。

所以不要期待太多：它的质感很廉价，闪闪放光芒的指示灯让我梦回初中电脑机房的双飞燕，手感当然也无从谈起，不能调节 DPI、没有辅助功能按键，它只是一个用普通 AAA 电池供电的普通小鼠标而已。
就是这样，即使价格已经很低（当然是相对于微软自家其他外设而言），但综合体验下来，微软海洋环保鼠标的体验大概是其他品牌百元价位鼠标的体验。真要说优势的话，大概还是它的设计我仍然很中意：这也…</span>

                    <span>数码产品爱好者，这是一个很宽泛的称呼，这个世界上有很多的数码产品种类，每个种类下更有不同的类别、等级，它们都很酷，但它们的酷体现在不同的方面，吸引着不同的群体。或许大众，或许冷门，但爱好者们终将找到自己梦想的归宿。
受到很多科幻电影的影响，我从小就迷小钢炮类型的设备——体积越小、性能越强，我就越爱它。原因无他，就很酷，人类总是对打破自己认知的东西有着别样的着迷——它体积这么小，性能怎么这么强？！大抵如此。
我读小学时候，家里购入的电脑还是一个傻大粗，那时候约莫是2006年上下，记不清了。上网还要听猫叫，盯着那台现在想起来不过十几寸的显像管，生疏地在机械键盘上敲着一个一个字符，是我对电脑的最初印象。
随着社会的发展，我从小学到了初中，我听说了有种玩意儿叫做「手提电脑」，它能把主机和显示器融合在一起，不插电就能工作两个小时；有种键盘叫做「薄膜键盘」，它很薄很轻，夹在腋下就能带走，整个键盘连着包装盒都没有机械键盘厚；有种鼠标叫「光学鼠标」，它没有传统鼠标的轨迹球，跟当时很流行的全透明玻璃电脑桌很配。
超酷，尽管现在我还是回到了机械键盘的怀抱，流行是一个圈，但那时候有个双飞燕薄膜键盘真的超酷。
跑题了。
偶然的一次机会，我在出游的火车上看到了一张宣传单，它打破了年轻的我对这个世界的认知。
我曾经以为在手提电脑上装windows XP打忍者神龟已经是最酷的事情了。
我错了。
有个东西它叫PDA，在彩色印刷的广告单上，它就一个巴掌大，滑盖的全键盘设计，跟当时最酷最炫的Nokia侧滑全键盘手机差不多大，但屏幕大得多。最重要的是，那个大小适中的4.5英寸屏幕上，是最新的windows Vista Home的桌面。
我 的 天 啊。
我至今记得那四个字母
V A I O，VAIO。
现在你可以在百度百科上找到它，VAIO的UMPC产品，VGN系列。
根据现在看到的配置来看，它在当时肯定是啥都…</span>

                    <span>《小狗钱钱》—— 一本理财天才童话
《小狗钱钱》是由德国作家博多·舍费尔所著，一本面向儿童的理财入门书籍。作者将理财观念，通过小狗“钱钱”的童话视角，传递给书中主人公吉娅。帮助吉娅实现了梦想，并且在很小的年纪便获得了理财上的成功。
但就目前教育的大环境而言，理财并不是应试教育中的必须，所以像我一样的大多数年轻人，成长到二十多岁才逐渐开始意识到理财的重要性。尽管近几年“如何在大学四年存款十万”“如何在大学赚到第一桶金”的帖子和视频火热，但是真正有意识和有能力做到的人，其实寥寥无几。
因此，尽管这是一本儿童读物，但是对于缺乏正确理财观念的我们大多数人来说，这依然是一本极好的入门秘籍。书中提到了非常多值得实操的方法，比如：把钱分成日常开销、梦想目标和金鹅账户三部分；进行明智的投资；成功日记；梦想储存罐等。（感兴趣的朋友可以仔细阅读哦！）
成功日记——更系统、更有效的帮助自己建立信心
舍费尔先生提到，同成功相比，我们更轻易地记住错误和失败，它们在我们大脑中留存的时间是成功的11倍。因此我们在自己心目中的形象总体上会比实际差得很多，而且我们周围的环境和我们所受的教育也宣扬这种消极倾向。
而一本成功日记可以让自己意识到自己有多优秀，帮助自己建立信心。往往自己的收入与自己自信的程度也息息相关，足够自信才有可能成功并获取更多收入。
那怎么记录成功日记呢？它其实是一个记录成功事件的日记。可以是自己所获得的每一次夸奖和每一次认可，也可以是自己遵守纪律，完成的一项任务，或者做了什么使某人快乐的事情，都可以记录在成功日记中。记录成功日记目的只有一个：更系统、更有效的帮助自己建立信心。
以我的成功日记为例，因为刚刚毕业参加工作，其实会有点迷茫，不知道现在的岗位是否合适，也不知道自己未来的方向在哪儿，更不知道自己有哪些能力能匹配什么样的工作。于是我在成功日记中尽可能的记录工作中完成得好的事项，一段时间…</span>

                    <span>我们实践卡片笔记法已近两年时间，How to take smart notes一书及中文版《卡片笔记写作法》前前后后也翻了好几遍，也与许多朋友们不断在探讨实践中的收获与困扰。近来，我们反思了自己在实践中遇到的主要困难，相应地调整了自己的笔记类型。我们的新系统更加重视项目笔记和索引笔记，探索实现“自下而上”模式和“自上而下”模式的互动和平衡。本文主要介绍我们近期对建立笔记体系的反思和调整后的基本框架。考虑到篇幅问题，本文分上下两篇，上篇介绍我们对笔记的再分类，下篇介绍笔记间的互动和笔记体系的构建。
卡片笔记实践中的三个困境
卡片笔记写作法通常以德国社会学教授Niklas Luhmann的笔记系统为例，强调卡片式的笔记方法，每条笔记短小而完整，笔记与笔记间充分建立链接。卡片笔记法的核心思想不是记笔记的技巧和窍门，而讲求一套完整的从笔记到写作的流程。卢曼教授将笔记分为闪念笔记（Fleeting notes）、永久笔记（Permanent notes）、文献笔记（Literature notes）、项目笔记（Project notes）和索引笔记（Index）。闪念笔记类似于我们的随手记，需要定期整理成永久笔记，整理后即可销毁。文献笔记记录文献信息和对该文献核心思想的简要总结。永久笔记是卡片笔记的核心，也是写作的基础。索引笔记为这些永久笔记提供检索途径，也有单独的卡片盒保存。项目笔记则记录与具体项目相关的笔记，项目完成后也可以销毁。
我们在实践初期尽可能安装书中介绍的方式操作，从中不断获益，但也不断遇到了一些困扰，似乎卢曼教授的操作并不完全适合我们的实际需求，主要有以下三大问题。
闪念笔记（Fleeting notes)用完就丢弃嘛？
《卡片盒笔记写作法》书中强调（p.192)要分清几类笔记，而其中闪念笔记主要是对收集的信息起提醒作用，可以用任何一种方式书写（活页本、便签本，甚至餐…</span>

@黎明前线 Alan：微软海洋环保鼠标
在微软去年的 Surface 新品发布会之后，就一直对这个号称「环保」、由海洋回收塑料瓶制成的树脂材料蓝色鼠标印象深刻。去年年底终于得偿所愿，入手了这款微软海洋环保鼠标。

撇开同样被微软设计成为方便残障人士开启的环保鼠标包装盒（暂且先不考虑残障人士会不会买这款鼠标），就鼠标本身来讲，微软海洋环保鼠标其实是让我非常失望的：首先就是堪称渲染图诈骗的实际鼠标颜色：实际观感鼠标更加淡灰色，黑色颗粒也会更加明显（但手感上没有区别）。

上面就是官方渲染图 &amp; 实际颜色效果（我已经将室内光源调整至最冷的模式，仍然比官方渲染图中那个洁白无瑕的颜色深了不少）。以至于在上手这款鼠标之后有朋友嘲笑：「你的鼠标是买洗衣粉送的吗？」，我的第一反应其实是「这个形容太准确了！」。

这款鼠标的手感更不值一提：鼠标本身很小巧，重量适中，如果你的手掌像我一样足够大的话可以手本身不移动就覆盖到整片屏幕操作，不过鼠标材质本身质感基本于一般廉价塑料鼠标无异，如果它的配色是纯黑色我的心理预期价位可能只有 ¥50。

所以不要期待太多：它的质感很廉价，闪闪放光芒的指示灯让我梦回初中电脑机房的双飞燕，手感当然也无从谈起，不能调节 DPI、没有辅助功能按键，它只是一个用普通 AAA 电池供电的普通小鼠标而已。
就是这样，即使价格已经很低（当然是相对于微软自家其他外设而言），但综合体验下来，微软海洋环保鼠标的体验大概是其他品牌百元价位鼠标的体验。真要说优势的话，大概还是它的设计我仍然很中意：这也…</span>

                    <span>Amazon Prime started out as a subscription for free shipping for online orders, but over the years has expanded into other benefits and categories, like extra features on Twitch and Prime Video. The ever-increasing benefits in turn has helped Amazon justify increased prices for Prime, and now the service is becoming more expensive yet again.

                    <span>今天是大年初三，第四集，先给大家拜个年。
几集播完，引发的一波波舆论有我们想到的、没想到的，千言万语化作一句话“咱老李啥时候有过这热度？”也许是我们一路来收到太多关于老李的负面言论，这么一下子我们都有些不适应。不过还请珍惜雪儿的独角戏。
另一方面从我个人而言，受邀来此只为了和大家分享，我会很认真的对待，有些评论虽然言语激烈但是说的在理，忠言逆耳再难听也得听着，听完还得寻思寻思，反手再说句谢谢。但对于那些只为发泄的言论，只能表示理解。
回归正题！先给大家放几张图。

当时我们寻思疗伤这事儿咋样能好玩有看点，又不能太肆意妄为，因为事儿赶着事儿，不能太放纵喽。所以感谢舒导啊，强烈建议美人出浴搞点福利，并带着我反复研究学习女神塞隆著名的某广告，最终成功被删减，不过万幸，没有全部删掉。

这些则是最后一场戏的删减，其实还好，只是删了特写和全景中尸体的数量，无非是最后的冲击力少了些。但难受的是我们“有始有终”的巴也，他的死亡特写删掉替换成破损的单钺，我怕有人误会他跑了，其实没有，他走了，还走得特别不安详doge，他的死状请记住，死的方式很有特点，会是谁的功法呢~
再说说最后一场戏巴也率人追来，不知道大家觉得压迫感如何，那场戏的气氛灵感来自英剧《浴血黑帮》，几个身着黑衣面容阴郁的挺拔男子，伴随着身后工厂的滚滚蒸汽大步行来，让我备受震撼。



再有个有意思的就是，姬如雪被巴也一脚跺晕，一开始踩的是肚子，但总感觉从构图到反应都不够冲击力，于是略作调整后，看到这里的同事无不以“卧槽”开头，尤其是磊哥，“卧槽！这TM都踩胸上了！”巴也这脚踩的有多狠，他后面走的就有多刺激。
最后再跟大家唠唠这一集最精彩的段落，姬如雪的“鸿门宴”。
不知道有没有小伙伴看过上映前，有一个叫“兖州大殿”的场景PV。那里面都是我们一开始的设想，偌大的破败古庙，两侧监国锦衣持刀而立，行注目礼，压力直给。那是美好的设想，压迫感是来了，但最后要是无双也太没意思（其实就是人多拍不起）。于是我们加入了巴也四徒（四人面具是喜怒哀乐，有看出来的嘛），设计了一场3D立体打姬。
运镜、动作编排这些就不细说了，好不好观众评判，这次从耳朵出发——音效和音乐。
首先音效，这场戏是多人混战，同时武器驳杂调度也大，特别适合作为例子来聊。在那个追着我要头发的音效师那里是第一步……

我们需要把细节、比例、大小、方向全部处理好，好的音效就是让你注意不到，同画面永远是一体的，是最真实的表达。但是当离开录音棚，离开拥有高解析和声场的监听级设备，很多东西就会被捏在一起，不是每个人都有好几千的耳机或音响设备去体验的，所以就来到了最后一步，就是我需要带上一个平价的耳机同时使用电脑自带的音响，再处理一遍音效。主要处理声音的重点，尽量保留细节同时把距离感和力度突出来，这种处理方式会有损音效本身的精度，但会让大部分设备都能更直接感受到我们所想表达的内容。放假走的匆匆，没拍照，有机会给大家看看剪辑软件上音轨的调整画面~
音乐也是同理，甚至更甚，毛大师那边就会用好几种喇叭模拟各种设备的效果，当然架不住坏的啊。记得刚播出那天，模型有个小姑娘看完输出的mov，跑过来慌慌张张告诉我
“李导李导，OP的声音有问题呀，念白听不清楚啊。”
我都惊了，急匆匆赶去拿起她的耳机，她告诉我
“导儿，用左耳，右耳是坏的”
我好像意识到什么，但还是拿起左耳带上，传出的声音就跟把你裹着被子沉海里一样，左边的解析一样有问题。所以啊，咱们有条件我强烈推荐戴耳机观看，稍稍在意一下自己的体感，求求了~
接着音乐部分，这一集可真是把我纠结死了，为姬如雪单独写了首《巾帼》，如果看到片尾的小伙伴可能会发现，片尾的曲子与姬如雪独战是一个旋律，它们都是《巾帼》。最终通过版其实是片尾这一首，从姬如雪拄剑站起，拔出匕首，大家可以试试把这个音乐贴上去，递进感更强更燃更合适，但问题是！音乐中的两次高潮，旋律是一样的，从姬如雪撞断柱子“而是，让他带我走！”这里开始，本想所有动效都摘掉，全靠音乐炸起来，结果，结果就是没炸起来……

当时我意识到，这种问题给毛大师淦碎了也没用，周期不等人，所有环节继续，到最终定剪时，我一咬牙，决定取上一版Demo的前半段保留最终版的后半段，在旋律上做些区别，音效也配合垫上一些，尽可能加大前后落差以增强冲击力。我都做好前面直接用Demo的准备了，毛大师知道后，赶在交片前重新录制调整，才有了两首不一样的《巾帼》，感谢毛亮老师，你简直是我们的HERO！
这些问题都是不到最后感觉不到的，突发状况，最后将进击版《巾帼》放在片尾我觉得还挺酷的，本来这集是要放原点的嘿嘿，再等等，下一集更合适！

介绍
App Startup是一个可以用于加速App启动速度的一个库。
出现的原因
以前初始化第三方库会在Application的onCreate中。
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        LitePal.initialize(this)
        AAA.initialize(this)
        BBB.initialize(this)
        CCC.initialize(this)
DDD.initialize(this)
EEE.initialize(this)
    }
    ...
}

现在越来越多的库在ontentProvider来初始化。
class MyProvider : ContentProvider() {

    override fun onCreate(): Boolean {
        context?.let {
            LitePal.initialize(it)
        }
        return true
    }
    ...
}



这样写逻辑不会有什么问题。
但是ContentProvider越来越多，启动就慢了。
关于ContentProvider的耗时，Google官方也有给出一个测试结果：

原理
把这些库放置到一个ContentProvider。
以前：

现在：

                    <span>好像，「XX 是一种生活方式」这样的句型要被用烂了。但是我实在想不到一个更好的方法去总结我接下来要写出来的这篇文章。毕竟，在少数派的写作本身，就是我生活的一部分，而我的生活方式中的确有不少成分是围绕写作这个目的去展开的。尽管我不是职业作家（天哪，我觉得如果我有那个自律的能力的话，我很想成为一名自由撰稿人），但是写作已经超越了爱好的范畴 —— 所以我只好把它定义为生活方式。
去年年底，我恰好迷上了美剧《Sex and the City》。这部美剧以 Carrie Bradshaw，纽约一家报纸的专栏作家，书写她自己和朋友们的罗曼史，作为展开的方式。当然了，这部美剧以其开放大胆的镜头著称，但是我却总是为主角 Carrie 写作的方式（时间、地点）而着迷：有的时候她是在窗边，看着对面的一对情侣做着不可描述的事情；有的时候是坐在床上，点着一根烟，开始冥想；有的时候是因为受不了公寓的拥挤不堪，出门去咖啡馆看着来来往往的人群 —— 或许正是这份写作时无拘无束的自由，让我最为渴望吧。

阅读是写作的开始
获取信息可能是输出信息的第一步 —— 我反正是这么觉得。自由的写作本身就来自大量的泛读，怪不得人们常说「天下文章一大抄」。套路都摆在那里，写作的时候留心借鉴，的确是事半功倍的。
我的阅读来源其实还算不上太「广泛」，只有一些会经常关注的媒体 / up / YouTuber，作为信息来源我个人认为已经足够，同时也不会每天感到信息过载。由于个人感兴趣的点主要集中在科技 / 数码方面，关注的媒体网站也大多数在此列。
YouTuber / B 站 up
现在是一个视频的时代，对吧？所以免不了的，我也关注了一些 YouTuber 和 B 站 up，主要也是有关科技的。关注视频类的账号，其实主要是因为有些时候看文字测评很容易睡着，视频其实从形式上有趣、直接…</span>

Sony has announced that it has cut its PS5 sales outlook, and that has nothing to do with demand. You can blame the continued shortage of PlayStation 5 machines on the chip shortage.
