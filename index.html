                    <span>Deno is a modern JavaScript runtime, competing with Node.js, that promises features like secure I/O and built-in TypeScript support. Ryan Dahl, Node.js&#x27; original creator, created Deno, building it in Rust.

In Ryan Dahl&#x27;s talk Ten things I regret about Node, he talked about many problems with Node. This includes things like Node&#x27;s failure to embrace web standards, security, Node&#x27;s way of compiling native modules (GYP), and NPM. Then, he revealed Deno. Deno was a new project that fixed many of the problems Ryan Dahl had earlier mentioned, along with extra advantages like built-in TypeScript support. Ryan Dahl initially built Deno in Go but later switched to Rust.
Since Deno was first announced, it has made significant progress. 1.0 was released in August 2020, and companies like Slack have …</span>

And sure, before I tried out the JetBrains ecosystem, I would’ve completely agreed. I would’ve even offered up my left kidney, fighting for the fact that VS Code was superior (just like M1 Pro Macs are) to any other IDE on the market. Now just a bit of background, I work at Blankly where we enable people to build trading algorithms on hedge-fund level cloud infrastructure in minutes instead of months. During one of our daily stand-up meetings, my co-worker, Emerson, was adamant about the JetBrains ecosystem and extended the meeting trying to convince one of us to give it a whirl.

                    <span>Introduction


Having a style guide is a very useful way of having a clear and consistent form of writing that can be improved over time. This guide is mostly useful for technical writers. I&#x27;ll be sharing a few things I learned so far, writing for an open-source community (Fastify).
There are a few things you need to know and consider when writing your style guide.
Even though it is necessary to have a style guide, knowing why can help you figure what needs documenting. Speaking with your community members, developers, or a lead (Could be a program/project manager or a developer advocate if there is one), can help you identify your organisation needs.
Perhaps, you want a style guide for open-source community members who contribute to existing documentations or intended for developers who w…</span>

                    <span>In a world driven by software applications web applications took a lot more importance over the last years, every business wanted to have an access throw internet . Having a portal on the internet is very important for your business so web development held a-lot more value than ever.
Any web application contains of two main components ( Client - Server )
Client can be the interface that a user use to interact with your application, this client can be web that exists in the browsers like (chrome , safari , etc…)
All this applications need  server that provides the logic require to power this users interfaces with functionality. 
So if I want to be a good backend engineer in 2022 what should I learn ? In the end of the article I will give you suggestion to work with but let&#x27;s first discuss what backend server is ? 
to simplify the case backend is a code or program written in certain language that is hosted on a server that can be accessed through the internet and because the internet has no state (it will forget you and your data so this data should be stored on a disk not in the memory 
To restore a data on a disk and retrieve it through-code databases are used. 

So when you request a thing from a client you trigger some code that make certain logic and data can be stored in the database or retrieved from it then response is sent to client.

So this was a simple friendly entry to the world of web development [backend] I tried to discuss the main idea in a simple way and in the next articles we will talk more in details about every component in the cycle of backend that can take you from rocky level to be an expert in the backend development .

                    <span>We made alwane.io a web-based tool giving you the ability to extract colors from a website URL or an existing CSS code, regroup/order colors, then generate a palette including a CSS/Sass file. A simple and handy tool to build your next project&#x27;s colors, get inspiration, and examine your website&#x27;s color palette.

It&#x27;s a simple web application to help you generate palettes for your projects. It uses a color sorting algorithm to gather colors from a website&#x27;s CSS or any other existing CSS code and regroup them into color classes. 
You can then order these colors, generate a CSS or SASS code, and start using it in your project. The tool also offers some other useful features: 
Colors can be extracted from an existing CSS code (the one used by the website) or from any other CSS code. 


Colors can be sorted and regrouped from a list of Hexadecimal codes.


Colors can be saved in sets: you can therefore create multiple lists of colors so that you can easily manage them. 


You have complete control of the pallet, where you can remove one color or a group of colors. 



I hope you like the tool. I’d be happy to answer any questions, and I welcome your feedback.</span>

                    <span>Today we will learn how to create our own Pipe or the Custom Pipe. If you are unaware about what a Pipe is in Angular then I would recommend you to go through the previous articles I wrote on Pipe. You can start from here
The need of custom pipe comes when the built in pipe does not meet our requirement.
✩ So now lets see how can we create our first Pipe ✩
The CLI command to create a Pipe is -
ng generate pipe 
the shorthand -
ng g p 
Lets open the command prompt in the project root and type in the below command -
ng g p custom-pipe-demo
custom-pipe-demo


One more line we can see in the command prompt which tells that the app.module.ts has been updated. 

So lets see how the pipe looks like -
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service.
It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. This chapter will give you an introduction to Spring Boot and familiarizes you with its basic concepts.
Spring Boot enables developers to build applications that are ready to use right away. By embedding a web server like as Tomcat or Netty into your program during the initialization phase, you may create independent applications that function without the need for an external web server.

                    <span>So you&#x27;ve written your Ethereum smart contract, and now you may be wondering how to deploy it. I recommend first deploying the contract to a Test Network (testnet), such as Rinkeby, before deploying it to Ethereum Main Network (mainnet). You can deploy to both testnet and mainnet by using the Remix web app.
Testnets behave similarly to the Ethereum Main Network, but the ETH required to transact with them is free to get from a &quot;faucet.&quot; Faucets are apps where you can input your testnet wallet address and receive testnet assets like ETH. (I like Chainlink&#x27;s Faucet and refer to it in the instructions below.) Testnet ETH enables you to pay the gas to deploy your smart contract to testnet and make test transactions.

As you probably know, the web browser, for the most part, is single-threaded, which means all the heavy lifting is done in a single thread, a.k.a the main thread.
That said, the web browser executes JavaScript code in the main thread, the same thread where parsing, layout, and paint happen.
This means if you have a large JavaScript file, the main thread will be busy evaluating your code before the user will be able to interact with the page.
She would have to wait, even though she won&#x27;t need every single functionality in that bundle right at the beginning.
So, a large JS file &#x3D; slower page load.

                    <span>三星 Tizen 应用商城已永久关闭

去年 6 月，三星公司关闭了 Tizen 应用商城的注册，并使商店只对现有用户开放，他们只能获得以前下载的应用程序。在 2021 年 12 月 31 日之后，Tizen 应用商店 永久关闭，不再对新用户和现有用户开放。最后一部运行 Tizen 的手机是三星在 2017 年发布的 Z4 手机。Tizen 公布于 2012 年 2 月，是英特尔 MeeGo 系统与三星 LiMo 系统的混合体。2016 年，Tizen 曾一度是全球第四大手机操作系统。由于三星电视全球巨大的出货量，Tizen 目前仍旧是 第一大电视操作系统。

TIOBE 宣布年度最佳编程语言是 Python

TIOBE 发布公告宣布了这一消息，该奖项被授予在一年内获得最高评级增长的编程语言。2021 年初，Python 从 TIOBE 指数的第 3 位开始，把 Java 和 C 都甩在身后，成为了 第一名。TIOBE 指数是基于一种编程语言在流行搜索引擎中的搜索结果数量的指数，并不表明最好或最有效率的编程语言，也不衡量整个互联网上用一种语言编写的代码量，并且不考虑非英语语言。


老王点评：这是一个趣味性排行榜，你不应该用这个来指导你学习哪种编程语言。




“快速内核头文件”项目 V2 进一步将构建速度提高了 88%

之前我们 报道过，“快速内核头文件” 项目会清理内核头文件依赖关系，大大加快 Linux 内核的构建速度。它可能会成为 2022 年最伟大的 Linux 内核功能之一。周末，该项目发布了 V2 版本，根据 Linux 5.16-rc8 上游状态进行了重构。值得注意的是，现在也支持用 LLVM Clang 编译器进行编译，这使得内核构建过程加快了 88%! 而之前使用 GCC 编译提升了 77%。


老王点评：积极关注这个项目，就是不知道内核社区对它的看法如何？毕竟牵涉太大了。</span>

                    <span>Audacity 是开源软件世界中的一个经典的强大工具，可以用于录音、编辑等对声音进行操作。




Audacity 声音编辑器是填补了一个似乎没有人意识到的空白的开源应用程序。它最初是在卡内基梅隆大学开发的，当时很多人还认为电脑只是用来办公和学习的，要进行严肃的多媒体工作需要特殊的 DSP 外围设备。Audacity 认识到，普通计算机用户偶尔也需要编辑音频。在此后的 20 年里，Audacity 团队一直为录音和清理声音打造这个开源的应用程序。

我经常使用 Audacity，作为一个受过培训的编辑，我已经习惯了在我的应用程序中使用重要的、通常是单键的键盘快捷键。通过围绕单个字母建立快捷键，你可以一只手放在鼠标上，一只手放在键盘上，所以选择一个工具或一个重要功能和点击鼠标之间的延迟仅仅是几毫秒而已。在本文中，我将专门给出我在 Audacity 中使用的键盘快捷方式，如果你想优化自己的设置可以参考。

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity

在大多数 Linux 发行版上，Audacity 都可以从你的软件包管理器中获得。在 Fedora、Mageia 和类似的发行版上：

$ sudo dnf install audacity


在 Elementary、Mint 和其他基于 Debian 的发行版上：

$ sudo apt install audacity


然而，我是以 Flatpak 方式来使用 Audacity 的。

在 Windows 或 macOS 上，可以从 Audacity 网站 下载一个 Audacity 安装程序。

它最近有一个叫做 Tenacity 的复刻版本，是另外的开发者团队准备延续 Audacity 的传统而开发的。在写这篇文章的时候，两者基本上是相同的应用程序，所以这篇文章同样适用于两者。以后是否…</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 大流行使一家联网温度计制造商 Kinsa 成为全国知名企业，因为它提供了一个可能了解疾病传播的窗口。




一家名为 Kinsa 的公司正在利用 物联网 技术来创建一个连接温度计的网络，收集大量的匿名健康数据，这些数据可以为了解当前和未来的流行病提供帮助。

该公司创始人兼首席执行官 Inder Singh 表示，能够近乎实时地跟踪美国各地的发烧水平，对于广大公众以及医疗保健部门和政府的决策者来说，都可能是一条至关重要的信息。

该系统的联网技术相对简单 —— 温度计通过蓝牙连接到用户手机上的一个应用程序，该应用程序通过互联网将匿名数据报告给 Kinsa 的云。Singh 强调说，该公司只整理到县一级的数据，并声称通过 Kinsa 的数据识别个人几乎是不可能的。

“我们不提供个人身份信息，我们不提供识别数据，”他说。“这款应用程序只会引导你找到你需要的护理和服务。”

有了体温读数和一些关于体温测量者的基本人口统计信息以及他们的其他症状，这款应用程序可以提供基本的指导，比如是否需要去看医生，以及用户所在的区域是否出现了异常的发烧程度。

然而，真正的价值在于 Kinsa 在其 美国健康天气地图 上分析和细分的聚合数据，这些数据是从该公司生态系统中的 100 多万个温度计收集而来的。根据 Singh 的说法，这个想法是为了给公众提供一种方式，让他们对自己的健康做出更明智的决定。

“这是一个参与性很强的活动，”他说。“每个人都能得到数据，每个人都能做出反应。”

Kinsa 仍然直接向消费者销售温度计，但该公司正计划与地方政府、卫生部门甚至学区进行更密切的合作——辛格说，Kinsa 已经与美国两个州（他拒绝透露其名称）以及包括佛罗里达州的圣奥古斯丁在内的多个市政府合作。

他说：“我们的希望是，我们能够找出如何建立一个可扩展的模型 —— 我们永远不会只靠卖 20 美元的温度计就可以在全球范围内扩展。”。我们的目标是使该产品能够广泛应用，从而成为医疗保健部门有意义的早期预警系统。

                    <span>这个真实的世界从来不是一个摆拍摄影棚，日常拍照的时候总会有些不如人意的元素「乱入」，比如脸上冒出的一颗痘、洁白墙上沾染的一块污渍、那些避之不及避无可避的人流…… 你或许可以通过调整角度、放大裁剪，以及耗时耗力的等待来拍摄一个相对完美的画面，那有没有更便捷的解决方式呢？「图片修复」是其中一个答案。
我最早接触此类功能，还是在 2014 年桌面端 Photoshop 中的「内容识别填充」，时至今日这依然是 Photoshop 中我使用频率最高的功能之一。而近几年在移动端，这一功能也非常成熟了，比如今天介绍的这款 TouchRetouch，就是一款专注于图片修复的应用。
TouchRetouch 可以通过算法，巧妙地将图片上你觉得碍眼的元素遮盖掉。近期推出的 5.0 版本，除了继续提升颜值外，还在操作细致度和修复智能性上作出进一步优化。如果说以前各类综合性修图软件的「修复」功能正在逐步赶上 TouchRetouch，那这次更新它又狠狠地将同行「甩在身后」。
UI 变化
TouchRetouch 5.0 外观的变化，主要集中在深浅配色和选择照片页两个地方。自从 iOS 13 设置深色模式以来，深浅双色主题已经成为许多应用的标配，TouchRetouch 算是姗姗来迟的那位。你可以在「设置 - 外观」调整主题，以及不同配色的图标。如果你对 5.0 回归拟物化的图片不太满意，就可以在这里换回之前的版本。
由于 TouchRetouch 此前一直为深色主题，所以双色主题的加入主要在于提升颜值和与系统的契合程度。而选图界面的变化，则更偏向功能性了。新版的选图界面支持 3 种不同的预览模式，点击左下角的切换按钮会在正方形和原始比例两种预览模式下切换，如果你在某一素材上使用双指打开手势还可以切换为大图预览模式。正方形预览是大多修图应用默认的拣选模式，整齐划一、突出中心元素又充分利用屏幕空间，可…</span>

是个人就有说话的需求。除了说「有用」的话之外，人们也需要说废话。微博是个用来向朋友乃至整个互联网喋喋不休倾倒废话的平台，但人们有时会发现，有些废话实在太废了，废到自己都不好意思让别人看到，这就催生了微博——以及朋友圈、豆瓣广播等——种种「某某可见」的废话权限管理体系。
然而这依旧不够。对包括我在内的大部分人来说，朋友圈和微博始终是个「对外开放」的窗口——无论隐私状态是「仅自己可见」还是「所有人可见」，只要进入这些平台，你就感觉自己光着屁股来到了沙滩上，哪怕披着隐形衣，熙熙攘攘的围观群众依旧在对你施加压力。这样一种「有人看着呢」的心理暗示，使得你无论如何也没法放飞自我，畅所欲言。
那么，哪里有专供人说废话的「私人微博」，只包含一个朋友的「朋友圈」，乃至没有任何人际互动的「广播」呢？
我开始感到这种需求，是因为用了一段时间的 flomo。虽然最终也没输出啥成果，但那种随时随地、想说就说的体验，委实让我欲罢不能。这种欲罢不能并非来自什么「知识的复利」——而是单纯的畅所欲言、释放自己话痨本性的快感。
然而 flomo 是付费产品（虽然免费也可用），而且数据在自家的服务器（而非本地或自己的云盘）上，至少对我来说，总归有点不安稳。我于是开始寻找更好的选择。
「私人微博」的标准
在试用和评价之前，我们先要搞清楚一点：我们想要的到底是什么？「私人微博」应用具备怎样的功能属性？在厘清我们的需求以及满足这种需求的功能之后，我们才能开始一种有的放矢的评估。
我想，既然名叫「微博」，轻量化必然是这些产品的首要属性，最好是能做到打开就写，关闭即存。我就因此…</span>

                    <span>TLDR: This tutorial explains how to add search functionality to your Hugo Website
After writing multiple blog posts, I quickly realized that more pages meant more clutter. If someone wants to find a post, they&#x27;d have to manually search for it by digging through each page. Imagine if I have 10 pages, with 6 blog posts per page. Finding an article would be difficult and a bad user experience. Adding a search bar, as well as tag filters, would fix this issue, so I did some research on how to implement this for my website.
I&#x27;m using Hugo as my static site generator and the documentation isn&#x27;t the best. Their docs show multiple options for implementing search, but their explanations are pretty bad. Some options include: using native Javascript, Elasticsearch, lunr.js, etc. But I went with a thi…</span>

A working grasp of JavaScript.
A good understanding of Node.js.
A working knowledge of MongoDB or another database of your choice.
Postman and a basic understanding of how to utilize it.
Security uses authentication and authorization, especially when gaining access to a system. But there&#x27;s a big difference between getting into a house (authentication) and what you can do once you&#x27;re there (authorization).
Authentication is the process of confirming a user&#x27;s identity by obtaining credentials and utilizing those credentials to validate the user&#x27;s identity. If the certificates are valid, the authorization…</span>

                    <span>In this small tutorial, we&#x27;ll take a closer look at using Gorilla WebSocket to write our own websocket server, at a more functional level than the basic example and easier to understand than the chat example.
What will our server be able to do?
Send new messages from clients to callback
Keep active connections and close / delete inactive
Send messages to active connections
First, we use the standard http help server net/http so that we can catch connection requests:
package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;html&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, echo)
    http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8080&quot;, nil)
}

func echo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, &quot;Hello, %q&quot;, html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
}

In order to build a professional web application, optimization and performance are two important things you need to care about.
There are many tips and techniques used to increase the performance of a web application, such as Debouncing and Throttling.
When it comes to debouncing and throttling, developers often confuse.
During this blog, I will go throw these two techniques in details using react.js, but it is the same principle for vanilla JavaScript or any other JavaScript framework.  
Before dive deep into debouncing, let&#x27;s see a simple and normal example that implement a search box that allows users to search something without clicking any button.
function App() {

  const handleChange &#x3D; e &#x3D;&gt; {
    console.log(&#x27;api call...&#x27;)
  }

                    <span>Happy new year! We start this year with an epic showdown. Today, we&#x27;ll teach a computer to play Tic-tac-toe with us by looking at different approaches from a dumbed down version of everything to a highly sophisticated AI. I&#x27;ll play five rounds of 50 games each against the computer and see who&#x27;s the ultimate Tic-tac-toe champion!
Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!
Most people have played Tic-tac-toe, or Noughts and crosses (is there a trademark? I don&#x27;t know, hopefully not), at least once in their life. It&#x27;s played by two players on a 3 by 3 grid. The goal is to get 3 of your own symbols (either O or X, hence &quot;Noughts and crosses&quot;) either on the diagonals, a row or a column. The turn-based game starts out with an empty board where the first player can set their symbol (usually X) on any cell they l…</span>

But before that, we need to know the difference between compilation and Interpretation.
The entire Source code is converted into machine code at once and written to a binary file 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s which can be executed later processor.

The Source Code gets Complied and covert the portable file (machine code) and then its portable files get executed and we are now able to run the program.


It&#x27;s a 2 step process 1. compilation and 2. Execution.


Always remember the execution would take place after compilation only.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been a software developer for over 8 years. I feel very confident and comfortable in Javascript ecosystems, especially ReactJS. But I&#x27;ve also worked in many more frameworks and languages, including Python, Ruby on Rails, C++, C#, PHP, WordPress, and straight up HTML and CSS. I&#x27;ve deployed and administrated servers using Heroku, Digital Ocean, and AWS. I&#x27;ve created and maintained loads of websites over the years.
However in many ways I feel I&#x27;m just scratching the surface. The more I learn about software, the more I learn there is to learn.
But today I want to press rewind and reflect on some of the things that helped me get to where I am today, and hopefully provide some useful tips if you&#x27;re trying to get a job as a developer.
I&#x27;ve always loved tinkering and messing with computers. G…</span>

                    <span>Metrics surround us. Whether you&#x27;re building the next big thing and need to measure customer churn, retention rates, etc. you will always need numbers to really back it up. This is the same when we are building trading strategies. We need easy and straightforward ways of analyzing whether or not our model is actually doing well. Now before we go into understanding various portfolio metrics, we have to first really understand the point of having good metrics. And for that, we have to understand what it means for a model to &quot;do well&quot;.
For some of you readers out there, you probably already know what you want out of a strategy and what metrics you may want to do. For that, feel free to skip ahead to the various metrics and their implementations.

                    <span>Time literally flies when you&#x27;re having fun!
I recently celebrated my first year anniversary at Amazon. My role as a Developer Advocate for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been all about meeting people - and I have found this to be an unbelievably fulfilling aspect of this role. 
In looking back on this first year, I had been considering writing about my experience as a Developer Advocate so far. 
It is nothing short of inspiring how the AWS user groups from this region continued to meet - virtually - during what continued to be a very challenging year for all of us.
Pretoria | Jozi | Ghana | Nigeria | Kenya were formed before the pandemic; these groups were able to continue to meet virtually.

                    <span>Hey, this is Mohammad Hassani 😃
if you are developing with Linux and wanna import database to docker with terminal you can use this tutorial...
first of all you should copy your .sql file to var/lib/docker/volumes/blog_blogmysql/_data
in terminal:
cp DATABASE.sql var/lib/docker/volumes/blog_blogmysql/_data

// Replace DATABASE to your database file name
now your database is ready to import, in this step execute docker in terminal,
dockstation for Linux, they are similar. and then you can execute there)
also in terminal:
docker exec -it CONTAINERNAME bash

// Replace CONTAINERNAME to your container name like site_mysql_1
now open mysql in terminal:
mysql -uroot -p DATABASENAME

if you dont have database in container you can use




mysql -uroot -p

and then:
CREATE DATABASE DATABASENAME;

// Replace DATABASENAME to your database name
ok! everything is set now and ready to go...
source var/lib/mysql/DATABASE.sql

it maybe take some time depends on your .sql file size and your computer.
you can use this code instead of step 3 and 4:




mysql --init-command&#x3D;&quot;set autocommit&#x3D;0&quot; DATABASENAME &lt; var/lib/mysql/DATABASE.sql

that&#x27;s it!
if you have another way, leave a message :)
Be happy! ;)</span>

                    <span>Developers building software with media features must store the media somewhere and, in most cases, transform and optimize it for the best experience possible. All the tasks involved they can perform with Cloudinary&#x27;s end-to-end image- and video management solution.
However, while building a Spring Boot REST API a while ago, I found that integrating with Cloudinary was a struggle, for it took a lot of time combing through GitHub repositories and debugging errors. In addition, although the Cloudinary documentation is pretty good, it does not describe the workflow for Spring Boot, and I had to figure that out on my own.
This tutorial walks you through the process of programmatically uploading media to Cloudinary from a Spring Boot application, saving you the time and effort I had to put in t…</span>

while sharing my content on other platforms I got a thought what if I can show my latest content on my GitHub profile? if people are visiting my GitHub profile and from there if they get to know my latest content that would be great right. so I started looking for how I can show my latest blogs on my GitHub profile. I found two solutions (two GitHub Actions) that we will be discussing in this article.
before jumping into solutions let&#x27;s first discuss what are GitHub actions and what they are used for.

                    <span>英国的植物出口 IT 系统只适用于旧版本的 IE 浏览器

英国政府部门要求，将植物和种子等产品从英国运往欧盟必须使用它们的 IT 系统来提前登记。但是，该系统 只能在 IE 浏览器 上正常工作，即使你使用最新的，还在支持期的 IE 11，你也必须在向后兼容模式下运行，因为该网站是 2000 年建设的。据统计，2021 年 12 月，IE 在全球的使用份额仅为 0.46%。IE 11 将于今年 6 月 15 日停止支持。


老王点评：看到国外政府部门也是这样，我就放心了。




Canonical 正在重构 Snap 应用

相比传统 Linux 安装包，Snap 更具可移植性，但它也有很多问题。除了这种容器式软件包固有的体积大、加载慢等缺陷，Snap 还不支持自定义软件库，必须通过 Canonical 的 Snap 商店分发。Linux Mint 就完全阻止了 Snap 应用程序的安装，并和其他一些发行版支持 RedHat 发明的 Flatpak 软件包。Canonical 正在计划 把 Snapcraft 拆成更小、更模块化和可重复使用的组件，以在一系列不同的产品中利用。软件包构建者可以使用通用的部件，并将添加的 Snapcraft 功能作为一个单独的层使用。


老王点评：我还以为 Canonical 会放弃 Snap，转向 Flatpak 呢。




Fedora 36 考虑放弃对 ifcfg 脚本的支持

虽然修改 ifcfg 脚本来管理网络连接已经基本上成为过去，NetworkManager 和类似的软件现在对大多数用户来说都很好用。NetworkManager 保留了对 ifcfg 脚本的支持，但如何处理这些文件是个麻烦，维护这种支持是个负担。ifcfg 脚本的设计没有前瞻性，导致了巨大的复杂性，而且其支持代码多达 13 万行，这还不包括巨大的测试套件，一直是各种错误的来源。因此，Fedora 36 考虑放弃 对这些脚本的支持。


老王点评：虽然这是一件好事，但是不可避免的，越来越多的老旧的、遵循古典 UNIX 哲学的东西会慢慢淘汰，这是 UNIX 哲学的没落么？</span>

                    <span>这篇文章讨论了安装 NumPy，然后创建、读取和排序 NumPy 数组。




NumPy（即 Numerical Python）是一个库，它使得在 Python 中对线性数列和矩阵进行统计和集合操作变得容易。我在 Python 数据类型的笔记中介绍过，它比 Python 的列表快几个数量级。NumPy 在数据分析和科学计算中使用得相当频繁。

我将介绍安装 NumPy，然后创建、读取和排序 NumPy 数组。NumPy 数组也被称为 ndarray，即 N 维数组的缩写。

安装 NumPy

使用 pip 安装 NumPy 包非常简单，可以像安装其他软件包一样进行安装：

pip install numpy


安装了 NumPy 包后，只需将其导入你的 Python 文件中：

import numpy as np


将 numpy 以 np 之名导入是一个标准的惯例，但你可以不使用 np，而是使用你想要的任何其他别名。

为什么使用 NumPy? 因为它比 Python 列表要快好几个数量级

当涉及到处理大量的数值时，NumPy 比普通的 Python 列表快几个数量级。为了看看它到底有多快，我首先测量在普通 Python 列表上进行 min() 和 max() 操作的时间。

我将首先创建一个具有 999,999,999 项的 Python 列表：

&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list &#x3D; range(1, 1000000000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(my_list)
999999999


现在我将测量在这个列表中找到最小值的时间：

&gt;&gt;&gt; start &#x3D; time.time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(my_list)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#x27;Time elapsed in milliseconds: &#x27; + str((tim…</span>

                    <span>在 Linux 或 BSD 操作系统上设置基本的实时流媒体服务器。




实时视频流越来越流行。亚马逊的 Twitch 和谷歌的 YouTube 等平台拥有数百万用户，这些用户消磨了无数小时的来观看直播和录制视频。这些视频服务通常可以免费使用，但需要你拥有一个帐户，并且一般会将你的视频内容隐藏在广告中。有些人不希望他们的视频提供给大众观看，或者想更多地控制自己的视频内容。幸运的是，借助强大的开源软件，任何人都可以设置直播服务器。

入门

在本教程中，我将说明如何使用 Linux 或 BSD 操作系统设置基本的实时流媒体服务器。

搭建实时流媒体服务器不可避免地提到系统需求问题。这些需求多种多样，因为实时流媒体涉及许多因素，例如：


流媒体质量： 你想以高清流媒体播放还是标清视频就可以满足你的需求？

收视率： 你的视频预计有多少观众？

存储： 你是否打算保留已保存的视频流副本？

访问： 你的视频流是私有的还是向全世界开放的？


在硬件要求方面没有固定规则，因此我建议你进行测试，以便找到最适合你需求的配置。本项目中，我将服务器安装在配有 4GB 内存、20GB 硬盘空间和单个 Intel i7 处理器内核的虚拟机上。

本项目使用实时消息传递协议Real-Time Messaging Protocol（RTMP）来处理音频和视频流。当然还有其他协议可用，但我选择 RTMP 是因为它具有广泛的支持。鉴于像 WebRTC 这样的开放标准变得更加兼容，我比较推荐这条路线。

同样重要的是，要明白“实时”并不总是意味着即时。视频流必须经过编码、传输、缓冲和显示，这通常会增大延迟。延迟可以被缩短或延长，具体取决于你创建的流类型及其属性。

设置 Linux 服务器

你可以使用许多不同的 Linux 发行版，但我更喜欢 Ubuntu，因此我…</span>

@宛潼：升级改造也值得记录
自从离职之后，我才有了更多时间来整理自己的桌面。但目前来说还不算是特别满意，主要是有很多细节和基础上的东西没有完善，例如桌子不够大、一些产品的外观或使用体验还没达到预期等等。因此，你在这里看到的其实是我正在升级改造中的版本，等到未来各方面基本达到了我满意的效果之后，再来写一篇文章和大家分享。

生产力套件
桌面必不可少的就是电脑、显示器和键鼠「生产力四大件」了。
由于我日常的工作多偏向于文字类型，同时还有开 Windows 虚拟机玩游戏（上古的 RTS 游戏，对配置要求不高）的需求，因此电脑依然还是旧的 Mac mini 2018 款，并没有升级到 M1。这台 Mac mini 购买时是最低的 8GB 内存，我自己升级到了 32GB，目前使用来说还是十分流畅，没有出现过爆内存的问题。

显示器则是我自己 DIY 的一款显示器，面板是 LG 32UL950 的同款，4K 的分辨率，Nano IPS 技术，色域达到了 98% 的 Display P3。同时，我还选用了一个与 Pro Stand 风格类似的底座，从正面看上去的效果非常棒。不过，显示器的背壳和驱动板我还没有很满意，日后会针对这两个部分进行升级，主要是换成原装显示器的雷电 3 驱动板，再自己去定做一个纯平的阳极氧化铝背板，最终实现全铝合金的外观。

键鼠我选用的是罗技的 MX 套装 —— MX Keys 和 MX Master 3。鼠标这一块不用多说，配合 Logi Options+ 可以实现触控板上的所有操作，而且握持感也非常不错。键盘则是近期更换的，因…</span>

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人：
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

从自我介绍开始
我是 津津乐道播客网络 的创始人朱峰，从 2000 年开始创业，津津乐道算是我的第五个创业项目。津津乐道是一个播客制作机构，我们希望通过声音这个媒介，让各领域的专业人士分享他们的所见所闻和有意思的经验、观点。通过播客，让专业人士建立属于自己的个人品牌和影响力。截止到现在，我们已经制作了十多档节目，围绕一、二线城市，3–5 年工作经验的 TMT 从业者，提供他们感兴趣的音频内容。

分享一件今年让你印象最深刻或者意义最重大的事
如果五年后回头看，2021 年一定是平淡、承上启下的一年，我们经历了 2020 年疫情的震惊、对每个人生活的重大改变，2021 年我们都在尽力尝试建立新的秩序和生活方式，我不觉得 2021 年会有什么「重大」的事情，大家都在努力适应后疫情的新世界，可能就是 2021 最令人印象深刻的事情吧。
过去一年，有没有哪些城市或地方是您想再去一次的？
曾经津津乐道最受欢迎的节目类目是旅行，但因为疫情，大家将近 3 年没有出过国门了，而国内时常爆发的小范围疫情也让人很难下决心来一场远游。我们希望在疫情后，可以重新拜访我们曾经去过的每一座城市，看看那里的人、那里的事有了什么改变。为了这个计划，我们跟大约20多个城市的听友都约定好，到时候一定回去再看一看，与他们聊一聊疫情给大家带来了什么。
如果让你用一个词概括自己的 2021 年，你会用什么词？
「且看」——这是津津乐道节目的一个梗，很多无法当时给出结论的事情，我们都会用这个词来概括，而整个 2021，其实也映衬了这个词的必要性：多看少做，苟下来静观市场的变化，比盲目下结论、做决定重要得多。
今年有学到什么新方法或新技能吗？
今年我们系统性地学习和梳理了播客节目制作的 SOP，把我们这五年积累的经验变成标准，希望能够把绝大多数的节目制作变成一个可以复制的工业化流程，降低大家制作播客、参与播客的门槛，让每位并不精通内容制作的专业人士也能利用播客这个媒介讲出他们自己的故事。
谈谈你的年度照片吧
我们的节目又一次帮助一个创业团队完成了冷启动，这是一家现饮精酿啤酒品牌——BlueArk，通过播客节目的介绍，让用户、投资者在更多维度上更深入的认识、了解了他们，完成了他们的 MVP 验证和第一轮融资。这是抖、快这类「快内容」完全做不到的事情，我们很自豪。

谈谈你的你的年度的电影吧
非常惭愧的是，这一年读得书太少，唯一几本也是专业领域的书籍，似乎对大家没有特别大的推荐价值。但倒是可以给大家推荐一部电影——《大空头》。这部电影诞生于 2015 年，不是一部新片。但故事表达的观点在今天看来却是极具价值的：当大家都在狂欢的时候，冷静与理性是极为宝贵的。这一年，播客行业经历了很多事情，年初，「风口」这个关键词一次又一次的被提及，一度让大家觉得播客即将是下一个抖快，马上就要被风吹起来了。而年末的一地鸡毛告诉大家，理智的市场判断远比一次又一次的追逐风口宝贵得多，在现下的市场环境下，排除噪音，做好判断可能会比盲目的投入、扩张更为考验创业团队的经验。

云鲸拖地机器人。扫地机器人很成熟了，但如果经常做家务你肯定会发现其实扫地以外，拖地更是刚需，而扫地机器人的拖地能力实在是比较鸡肋的，直到我们遇到这款几乎专门为拖地设计的设备。 因为工作特别忙，几乎不可能抽出时间每天拖地，现在只需要定时设置一个拖地任务，当扫地机器人工作完毕，就放出来云鲸来拖地。尤其是有宠物的家庭，懂的都懂。

Data exploration and analysis is a time-consuming process. We’ll continue to explore the Telco Customer Churn dataset to get a brief overview of data by using the descriptive statistical analysis method.
Recap

Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive statistical analysis
Conclusion
In part 2 of the series, Guide to Churn Prediction, we explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify dependent and independent features, find missing values, and understand their mechanisms.
Let’s understand the 2 common terms that we often hear when dealing with data.

Data collected from the entire population is known as population data. The population is dynamic (it changes continuously), so it’s practically impossible to gather population data.

                    <span>A crucial part of every project is planning. Luckily for us, it&#x27;s also where the most fun is! 
Contrary to popular belief, design is not about drawing, but about making assumptions, validating them and deciding how your service will work.
There are various ways of doing it and, chances are, you&#x27;ll come up with your own. Therefore, just to give you something to start with, I&#x27;ll share the way I do it.
I call it lazy developer design 🤪, but you can refer to it as agile data driven user-first continuous design and development methodology 🤯 if you must.
It boils down to the principle of doing as little design as possible, then doing as little coding as possible, rinse and repeat.
So, what are we building today?

                    <span>Developing the &quot;onboarding&quot; process for a new person in an engineering team takes a lot of dedication, and keeping this process fluid takes even more work (with as little friction as possible).
This issue is challenging for any team working full time, it is even worse for Open Source projects where contributors usually work in their spare time. We should make this process as fluid as possible so that people don&#x27;t get discouraged by the complexity of getting up there and testing, until they make their first pull request.
Every developer has a different way of setting up a development environment, even if it is in a popular technology (programming language) with lots of documentation, text editor extensions (emacs, vim, vscode, ...), etc.
We developers are used to “our way” of doing things, …</span>

I recently posted a tutorial on how to better manage and maintain the lifecycle of Azure resources, automating resource decommissions by using a simple Decommission tag with a date value, and an Azure serverless Function App. The tutorial also includes how to track successful and failed decommissions using the function apps own storage account by recording the decommission events into table storage.

                    <span>Continuing on with my last post, I want to look at another function which I consider particularly elegant, the psi combinator:
const psi &#x3D; (f) &#x3D;&gt; (g) &#x3D;&gt; (x, y) &#x3D;&gt; g(f(x), f(y));

In TypeScript:
const psi &#x3D; (f: (x: A) &#x3D;&gt; B) &#x3D;&gt;
  (g: (x: B, y: B) &#x3D;&gt; C) &#x3D;&gt;
  (x: A, y: A): C &#x3D;&gt;
  g(f(x), f(y));

This is also called on in Haskell.
What it does is map a function over both arguments of a binary(two-argument) function. This is similar to the B combinator but changed to work on binary functions.
The quintessential usage is when sorting records:
// given a compare function
const localeCompare &#x3D; (item1: string, item2: string): number &#x3D;&gt;
  item1.localeCompare(item2);

// and some accessor function that drills into a data structure
const getName &#x3D; (person) &#x3D;&gt; person.name;

// compose that accessor with the compare function to drill both sides
const compareNames &#x3D; psi(getName)(localeCompare);

// which can be passed to a sort method for an array of that structure
people.sort(compareNames)

Interestingly, this is equivalent to doing a map and then sort, but using psi is theoretically more memory efficient:
// generates an extra array
people.map(getName).sort(localeCompare)

Look out for other opportunities to use psi and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find them. Particularly if you&#x27;re doing data aggregation or processing. 
Pedantic Disclaimer: Psi is usually defined with the binary function as the first argument but I preferred the similarity  to B combinator when taking the mapping function as the first.</span>

The easiest way is using the pip install, by executing:

Also, remember to add this line to your python code, so you can be able to use the SDK

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re going to build out a random number generator using JavaScript. Random number generators are a fantastic beginner JavaScript project. You get to work with some of the important basics while creating something that serves an actual use!

I&#x27;ve been asked before about when we would actually use a random number generator. Sure, it&#x27;s a fun quick, project, but what are some of the real life use cases?
Typically, you would use it as a standalone app like we&#x27;ve created here. It would likely be used within a larger application. A function such as randomNum() would return a random number, which could in turn do something like grab a specific item from an array (at the index of the random number returned). This allows you to create a basic lottery style system within an application.

本周话题：一个程序员的财务独立之路
本周，推荐一篇美国程序员的文章。
作者20岁时第一次当实习生，发现在 IT 行业，普通人有可能在30多岁就实现&quot;财务独立&quot;，不再为维持生计和支付日常账单而劳碌。以前，他一直以为每个人都需要工作到退休。
从此，他就将财务独立作为自己的人生目标。

2009年，他大学毕业了，没有任何积蓄，进入英特尔公司担任初级工程师。当时的年薪是10万美元，年支出3.8万美元，再扣掉税，第一年就有了3.5万美元的净资产。
以后，他每年都记账。在这篇文章里面，他公开了收入和支出（见下表）。十二年以后的2021年，他已经是亚马逊的高级工程师，年薪62.5万美元（含股票），年支出7.8万美元，净资产达到了240万美元（含股票）。

他详细说了，自己怎么经过十二年的奋斗，在35岁做到财务独立，我觉得很有借鉴意义。
（1）首要的努力方向，就是追求工资提升。 普通人的收入来源，主要还是本职工作，如果工资很低，根本不可能实现财务独立，所以必须想方设法提高工资。
一般来说，大厂的高级职位可以拿到稳定的高工资。所以，他要求自己一定要进大厂，并且做到高级工程师。
（2）每过三年，就到别处面试。 他一般三年换一家公司，这样可以获得显著的加薪和晋升。他说每次换公司，收入至少增加30%。另外，还可以让自己始终拥有一种进取的心态，不断…</span>

                    <span>本田汽车的时钟穿越回 20 年前，且无法修复

本田和讴歌车主报告说，他们的时钟和日历被卡在 2002 年的 某个时间。本田公司说它正在调查，如果它没有找到修复方法，时钟应该在 8 月的某个时候自行纠正。这可能是配备的导航系统的 GPS 导致的。一位用户发现，它的 GPS 日期被设置为 2002 年 5 月 19 日，也就是过去的整整 1024 周。GPS 从一个纪元开始测量时间，然后广播一个代表一周的数字，这个数字最大为 1024，每 19.6 年达到最大值之后会回滚。虽然上次回滚是 2019 年 4 月 6 日，但可能本田汽车的 GPS 增加了一个偏移量，因而在 2022 年第一周发生了回滚。


老王点评：虽然千年虫问题已经人尽皆知了，但是还是有粗心的程序员总是出现各种溢出问题。




聊天机器人仍然很蠢

50 年前，AI 专家曾经预测几年内会出现“相当于普通人类水平的通用智能机器”，然而并没有。根本障碍 在于，尽管计算机算法确实非常善于识别统计模式，但它们不知道这些模式意味着什么。大型语言模型（LLM）可能是由统计学驱动的。与 Google 最先进的聊天机器人 LaMDA 的对话令人印象深刻，非常像人类的口吻，但是它们不过是“流利的废话喷井”，或者是“随机鹦鹉”罢了。


老王点评：这些聊天机器人只是知道“应该”怎么回答，但是它其实并不知道说的是什么。




英国警方扣押了超过 4 亿美元比特币

根据 披露的信息，英国警方扣押了价值超过 4 亿美元的比特币和其它加密货币。英国警方缴获了这些加密货币并将其出售：一半交给英国内政部，另一半用于重新投入调查。

另外，据报告，2021 年加密货币相关犯罪的规模 高达 140 亿美元，而 2020 年才 78 亿美元。


老王点评：这比打击一般的违反犯罪行为的缴获更多，警察们也更有动力。

                    <span>最近，多数读者可能已经了解到了一些关于 Log4j 漏洞的信息，这个漏洞自从 12 月 9 日披露出来之后，不断给系统管理员增加烦恼。这个漏洞比较容易利用，可以用来进行远程代码执行，而且整个互联网上的服务器中到处都有这个问题。把它称为近年来被披露的最糟糕的漏洞之一，并不算夸张。从某种意义上来说，从 Log4j 中得到的教训并没有什么新的内容，但这个漏洞确实进一步明确地突出了自由软件生态系统中的一些问题。

出了什么问题？

有很多文章详细描述了这个 bug 的机制，以及如何利用，在这个 页面 上就收集了很多。简而言之：Log4j™ 是一个 Java 日志软件包，由 Apache 软件基金会注册了商标并进行发布。它已经被包含进了许多其他项目，在互联网上到处都可以找到 Log4j。事实上，根据这篇 文章，Log4j 已经被下载了超过 2800 万次（仅仅统计了过去四个月里的情况）并且是将近 7000 个其他项目的依赖项。因此，Log4j 中的漏洞很可能就会成为碰巧使用了它的那些其他系统中的漏洞。

正如 Apache 软件基金会在 6 月份自豪地发出的一条 推文 所说，它甚至也存在于火星上的灵巧号直升机之中。

通常情况下，人们认为一个日志工具应该只是把感兴趣的数据接收下来并可靠地记录下来。Log4j 似乎做到了这一点，但它也做了一些可以说是任何日志系统都不应该做的事情：它主动地对要记录的数据进行解释、并相应地采取行动。它可以做的事情之一就是查询远程服务器的数据，并将其纳入日志信息中。例如，它可以从 LDAP 服务器获取信息并加入到日志中，这样在人们希望在日志中加入某个用户的详细账户信息的数据时，这个功能就会很有用。

然而，事实上远程目录服务器可以提供更多形式的数据，比如说可以提供一个序列化处理（serialized）的 Java 对象，被后续重新组装起来进行执行。…</span>

今年，我们刊登了几篇关注商业中的开源的好文章。这些文章展示了开源作为工具、平台或集成点在商业中的力量。让我们回顾一下 2021 年的一些顶级开源商业故事。

《我最喜欢的开源项目管理工具》

如果你在办公环境中管理过项目，你很可能使用微软 Project 来跟踪任务和分配。然而，开源社区已经创造了许多跟踪项目的选项。对于你的 项目管理需求，Frank Bergmann 写了关于使用 Redmine、project-open、ProjectLibre、GanttProject、TaskJuggler 和 ProjeQtOr。

《使用 Apache Superset 进行开源商业智能报告》

通过商业智能，你可以通过对数据进行分类、安排结果和显示上下文信息来更好地了解你的信息。对于任何想要做出“数据驱动”决策的组织来说，商业智能（BI）是一项关键技术。Maxime Beauchemin 的文章讨论了 Apache Superset，以及它如何成熟地成为一个领先的开源 BI 解决方案。

《6 个用于餐馆和零售商的 WordPress 插件》

这场大流行病可能永久性地改变了许多人喜欢做生意的方式。餐馆和其他当地的零售机构不能再像以前那样依赖上门交易了。网上订购食品和其他物品已经成为一种常态和期望。当大流行结束后，消费者不太可能背弃电子商务的便利。Don Watkins 写了 六个开源插件，帮助你创建一个 WordPress 网站，满足你的客户对网上购物、路边取货和送货的偏好。它还可以建立你的品牌和你的客户群。

《试试 Chatwoot，一个开源的客户关系平台》

在任何有面向客户的业务中，保持与客户的互动是至关重要的。我们最后一次接触这个客户是什么时候，或者他们最后一次接触我们是什么时候？我们的组织中谁做了回应？什么服务水平协议制约着这种关系？这些和其他问题最好在客户关系管理系统（CRM）中进行管理。Nitish Tiwari 介绍了 Chatwoot，一个用 Ruby 和 Vue.js 构建的开源客户关系平台。Chatwoot 是从零开始写的，目的是让客户关系团队建立端到端的票据管理和支持平台。本文将介绍 Chatwoot 的架构、安装和主要功能。

《试试 Dolibarr，一个开源的客户关系管理平台》

无论你是经营零售店、餐厅、酒吧、超市、健身房还是其他业务，你都需要一个可靠的方式来与你的客户保持联系。毕竟，他们是客户，因为他们喜欢你做的事情，如果他们与你分享了他们的联系信息，他们想听到更多关于你所提供的东西。Pradeep Vijayakumar 介绍了 Dolibarr 项目，一个开源的企业资源规划（ERP）和客户关系管理（CRM）软件。Dolibarr 提供了一整套 ERP 功能，包括销售点（POS）、发票、存货和库存管理、销售订单、采购订单和人力资源管理。

《微软 Exchange 的一个开源替代品》

多年来，微软 Exchange 作为群件环境的必然选择。然而，在 2020 年末，一个奥地利的开源软件开发商推出了 grommunio，它是一个群件服务器和客户端，其外观和感觉为 Exchange 和 Outlook 用户所熟悉。Markus Feilner 写了关于 grommunio 如何在企业中取代 Exchange，成为群件的一个强大而功能齐全的选择。

《用这个开源工具简化发票的指南》

许多 IT 项目在开发过程中会延迟、超出预算，并出现巨大的变化。这些问题使开具发票成为 IT 领域最费力的活动之一。Frank Bergmann 写了一篇关于开源项目如何 简化开票过程 的文章。如果你决定成为自雇人士或成立一个创业公司，Frank 的文章也可以作为处理财务工作的指南。

开源是好生意

开源软件不仅仅是为开发者服务的。企业也可以利用开源软件的力量。事实上，开源是许多商业领域的一个主要驱动力。你今天使用的工具可能本身就是开源软件，或者使用开源作为堆栈的一部分。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-14155-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                    <span>Linux Mint 20.3 “Una” 有一些细微的视觉变化，弥补了现代外观，以及新的应用改进。




代号为 “Una” 的 Linux Mint 20.3 终于来了。官方公告应该很快就会跟进，但它现在已经可以下载了！

虽然 Linux Mint 20.2 有一些令人印象深刻的改进，但 Linux Mint 20.3 看起来也是一个不错的版本。

在这里，我会重点指出 Linux Mint 20.3 的关键变化。

Linux Mint 20.3 的新变化



在这个版本中，Linux Mint 20.3 包含了最新的 Cinnamon 5.2，一些细微的视觉变化，以及其他各种改进。

请注意，在 Xfce 和 MATE 版中的变化是一样的（不包括桌面环境的具体改进）。

Cinnamon 5.2 桌面环境

在 Cinnamon 5 中，增加了一些调整和管理桌面环境所消耗资源的功能。

这一次，升级的重点是几个新功能。日历小程序增强了功能，当你点击系统时间/日期图标时，可以直接从系统托盘上显示事件。

如果你使用 GNOME 日历或在线账户（如 Google 日历），这些事件应该是同步的。



除此以外，你还会发现 Nemo 文件管理器的改进和窗口动画的细微变化。

还有一些必要的错误修复和总体上的小改进。

新的背景

新的版本、新的壁纸，总是令人耳目一新。而且，Mint 20.3 也不会让你失望。



你会得到一个精心策划的美妙的壁纸集，你可以选择使用。

视觉主题刷新及深色模式



在 Linux Mint 20.3 中，主题已经进行了改造，对重点颜色轻微进行了重新处理（使其更时尚一些），并从一些小部件中删除了它。

与窗口的圆角一起，这构成了一个更干净和现代的外观。

总的来说，包括新的图标，Linux Mint 20.3 带来了一个新的主题包。

如果你想要同样的外观，同时保持其他的优点，你可以简单地从仓库安装传统主题包并应用它。



一旦你安装了传统主题包，就可以在选择中找到它了。



不仅如此，你可以注意到，我更喜欢用深色模式的截图来写文章，因为 Linux Mint 20.3 终于把更多的注意力放在深色模式上！

一些默认的应用程序，如 Hypnotix、Gnome 终端、Celluloid，都是在启用深色模式的情况下启动的。如果你愿意，你可以永久地禁用它们。

新的 Thingy 应用程序

当 Clem（Linux Mint 的首席开发者）暗示会有一个新的惊喜应用时，我们 很快就在 Linux Mint 20.3 里发现了它。

在稳定版更新之前，测试版就已经确认了它。



新的 Thingy 应用程序也被称为 “Library”，它实际上是 Linux Mint 默认的文档管理器。你可以下载电子书和其他 PDF 文件，Library 应用应该会自动从下载目录中检测到它。

应用程序的改进



一些默认的应用程序，如 Hypnotix IPTV 播放器和便签现在可以分别让你搜索频道或便签。

其他改进

其他一些改进有助于提高性能，更好地节省电力，以及更多。

考虑到它是基于 Ubuntu 20.04.3 的，带有 Linux 内核 5.4 LTS。



你可以在官方公告帖子中找到更多关于这些变化的信息。

下载 Linux Mint 20.3

你可以从官方主页上下载 ISO。他们还没有更新下载页面，但你可以从他们的 Torrent 下载页面 找到最新的 ISO。

如果你想要直接的下载链接，你可以看一下 全球镜像 来获得所有的 Linux Mint 版本。

[美剧] 波巴·费特之书

关键词：动作 / 科幻 / 冒险
片长：60 分钟（单集）× 7 集；豆瓣链接

史上最强，赏金猎人。

@潘誉晗：事实证明，只要迪士尼认真起来就还是「业内大佬」。作为《曼达洛人》的衍生剧，《波巴·费特之书》用剧集本身的热度和口碑完美诠释了什么叫做「衍生剧的衍生剧，也可以很好看」。
剧集的主人公波巴·费特是「星球大战」IP 里非常著名的角色之一，他是银河系最令人闻风丧胆的赏金猎人詹戈·费特的克隆体。在《星球大战 2：克隆人的进攻》里的克隆人战争爆发的前十年，詹戈以自己作为克隆人模版为条件，要求获得一个未经任何改造的、和其他克隆人不一样的复制体，这个复制体就是后来的波巴。而本剧的主要内容就是讲述在贾巴去世之后…</span>

                    <span>引言
时值期末季，不少读者或许还保留着当年寒假前领取成绩单的回忆。那张薄纸上的数字和话语，代表着对我们前一个阶段表现的评价。
在科技行业中，Apple 可谓是被评价最为频繁的公司之一。由于影响力之广、用户数之多，似乎谁都能点评出一两句来。用户当然有权评价，但这样的评论确实容易偏于零散和即兴——Apple 的业务涉及好几条不同产品线、上百种不同型号，横跨软件、硬件和服务领域，它在不同方面的表现必然有高低之分；关于 Apple 的资讯动态连篇累牍，但同一件产品、同一个事件分别放在出现当时和一段时间之后观察，很可能就有不同的意义。
因此，像成绩单那样，将过去一个时间段的整体表现分为多个「科目」、分别给予评价，或许是更有参考性、更能反映规律的做法。
这也正是我们想要提出的问题：对于 Apple 在 2021 年的各方面表现，你打几分？
需要说明，这一模式并不是我们的原创。从 2015 年开始，国外知名 Apple 领域博主 Jason Snell 每年均会制作称为《Apple Report Card》的同类选题（今年的结果尚未发表），已经形成了比较完善的格式，且积累了一定的趋势数据。
然而，Jason Snell 调查的基本都是美国用户，其结果反映的也必然是美国用户的观点。作为在 Apple 用户中举足轻重的另一群体，中文用户理应发出体现自己独特视角的声音。
为此，我们借鉴了这种模式，在 2021 年底，向 20 名具有一定影响力的中文 Apple 用户发出问卷，请他们从九个维度对 Apple 在 2021 年的表现作出评价。

受访者中，既有 Apple 生态耕耘多年的开发者，也有见多识广的投资人；既有平时从事科技测评、影像制作的「专业」用户，也有用 Apple 产品处理日常工作学习的建筑行业、学术圈用户；其中不少还是少数派读者熟悉和喜爱的熟面孔。我们相信，这能比较全面地反映不同…</span>

一点必要的声明：

虽然本文不涉及，但是修改卡内金额和未经同意复制他人卡片都属于违法行为。

这篇文章拖了又拖，一开始是我把事情想复杂了。所以这里不写原理只写做法，有用就行。
本文仅是对自己折腾门禁卡的总结，希望针对两种情况给大家提供一点思路：

自家门禁卡不够用，去物业办理又太麻烦或者太贵1
想把门禁卡放在手机上或手环上

把门禁卡放手机、手环上主要原因有两个：一是预防忘带钥匙（门禁卡）的情况，比如临时下楼取快递、外卖，出门着急忘带门禁卡用不了电梯；二是减少一样随身物品，毕竟用指纹锁已经可以少带钥匙了，但是门禁卡还得带在身上。另外冬天去兜里或者包里掏门禁卡这个小东西并不方便，而手机总在手上。
回到门禁卡。本文所讨论的门禁卡，最常用的有两种，ID 卡和 IC 卡，其中 ID 卡无法用手机模拟，但可以通过贴纸来实现；iPhone 暂时不支持复制门禁卡，也可以通过贴纸来实现或者去物业写入，最后会补充；Android 手机通常可以在手机系统自带的「钱包」应用里看看，如果有创建空白卡功能，则大概率可行。
下面展开讲讲。
简单确认门禁卡类型
门禁卡种类繁多，但我们没必要了解太多专业知识。这里简单将我们日常生活中主要会用到的门禁卡分为 ID 卡和 IC 卡两种。
ID 卡是比较早期的门禁卡，卡上面一般会有 00 开头的十个数字。这种卡卡里只存一个号码，很容易复制。它们的外观参考这样：
ID 卡通常有「00」开头的十位数字卡号
不过也有例外，除了上图这种常见的水滴卡，还有长方形大卡片、滴胶卡等等。
IC 卡同样也可能采用水滴形设计，但卡片上一般…</span>

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
进入12月后，勇士队遭遇了一波进攻寒潮。11月，他们还能打出114.8分的百回合得分，而到了12月就只剩下了110.5分，在1月的三场比赛中更是低到了107.4分。相应地，球队核心库里也“难辞其咎”，个人百回合得分从11月的116.4分跌落到了12月的112.1、1月的110.2分，真实命中率更是从63.9%跌到了58.1%，1月份更是惨不忍睹的39.4%。
对于造成勇士和库里如此下滑的原因，首先当然是库里个人的消耗问题。本赛季，库里在每回合之中、特别是进攻端的移动距离，比之17-18、18-19赛季，都有了一定的上涨。在曾经的勇士2.0时代，库里已经是一个拥有大量无球跑动、不断进行换位移动的进攻手，而本赛季的他则在本已不小的跑动量上进一步提高，来到了后卫中进攻跑动第九多的位置，且年过三十的年龄，也在加兰、科尔安东尼、德章泰穆雷等一众年轻人之中，显得格外突出。而在防守端，由于勇士一贯采取的集体换防策略，库里的跑动量自然也不会少，18-19赛季就有着后卫中第八多的防守移动，而本赛季也只是相对下降了0.07米。况且，我们还需要考虑到库里为了增强防守对位能力而采取的增重，对身体造成更大的负担。

年龄的增加、体重的上升、移动的剧化，随着赛季的深入，这些问题逐渐开始影响库里，拉低了他的表现稳定性。这是每一个核心球星都必然面对的生涯阶段，出现波动，并不算非常离奇。而在此前的赛程中，勇士队也及时地找到了能为库里排忧解难、分担压力的替代者，乔丹普尔成为了球队的二号持球手，策动了相当比例的挡拆回合，也成为了比威少之于詹姆斯来得性价比远高的解压存在。
然而，这样的良好趋势，却在12月开始，特别是到了1月份的几场比赛，开始出现了裂痕。对此，我们可以从阵容搭配中的变量来做初步把握。球队进攻最为气势如虹的11月，乔丹普尔场均拥有31.5分钟的出场时间，14.7次出手，…</span>

还换了名字
呸！恶心
我都降价清库存
这种事儿你们可以花点儿钱嘛

就是一句话！恶心！
钱肯定是挣不着啦
恶心！恶心！

好了，抖机灵结束，回归正题。
与2021款理想One上市时刚买了老款的车主维权类似，这两件事的背后其实都反映了同一个问题——在脱离了传统的4S店销售模式后，新入局的玩家们如何在销售端处理好新老车型交替。
问题根源是没处理好车型新老交替时的销售策略
传统车企是怎么做的
俗话说“早买早享受，晚买有折扣”。
以往，传统车企在新款车型上市前夕，一般都会对店内库存的老款车型进行降价促销，用0库存来迎接新车的到来，否则新车上市后老车就砸手里了。
比如在新款奥迪A3上市前，老款A3的裸车价一度低至14万。
等新款上市后，初期一直都保持着20万的价格，即使到现在，最低报价也仍然在18万左右。
因此，虽然新A3相比老A3升级了很多内容，但是买老A3的用户看在6万块的差价上也不会觉得自己亏了。
当然，也有部分车型销量异常的好，直至生命周期末尾可能都没有优惠，但是这类车待新款上市后往往都需要加价排队提车。
所以老款还是会比新款便宜。
新势力们有哪些区别
但是随着越来越多的新势力入局之后，原先“车厂——4S店；4S店——用户”的交付链路变成了如今的“车厂——直营店/app——用户”。
车辆的终端售价也由原先“车企和4S店共同决定”变成了现在的“车企单独决定”。
但是为了保持品牌形象，新势力往往又不会主动选择在老款车型即将停产时降价。
再加上如今随着电动化、智能化的快速发展，汽车更新换代速度也明显要比以前快得多，消费者根本想不到一台车这么快就会成为老款。
这两个因素一叠加，在新款上市之际原价买了老款的用户自然觉得自己是被割了韭菜。
所以对于选择直营的企业来说，如果管理好用户的预期非常重要。
是不是所有新势力都没处理好？
也并不是，比如蔚来在这方面我认为还是处理得不错的。
一方面，蔚来通过“卖期货”这种方式让潜在消费者了解自己在未来半年或一年内的产品发布规划，防止打用户一个措手不及。
比如蔚来在2021年一月份就发布了ET7，并且开放了预定，而直到2022年1月才启动锁单。
对于ET7的潜在用户来说，如果在这期间看上了别的车，随时可以退预定金；而对于预定现有NT1.0产品的用户，他们也一定是在权衡了新技术和早提车之后才做出了选择。
另一方面，虽然蔚来不会主动调整车辆指导价，但是当现有老款车型竞争力不足时，蔚来会采用置换补贴、贴息以及其他商业优惠来变相降价。
因此，直营并不代表就无法妥善处理新老交替导致的销售问题。
售后问题
至于售后，老车主们还真不用太担心，毕竟赛力斯只是改了个名字，运营主体并没有变。
问界就是赛力斯，赛力斯就是问界。

                    <span>Elliott Marquez challenged me to write a redux controller on the Lit &amp; Friends slack.

I work on Developer experiences at Chrome and closely with the web platform
    
So let&#x27;s get cracking!
First step let&#x27;s make a new project and import some dependencies to help us develop.
mkdir controllers
cd controllers
git init
npm init --yes
npm i -D typescript lit
touch reducer.ts

Ok next we&#x27;ll set up the controller class in reducer.ts
import type { ReactiveController, ReactiveControllerHost } from &#x27;lit&#x27;;

export class ReducerController implements ReactiveController {
  constructor(
    public host: ReactiveControllerHost,
  ) {
    host.addController(this);
  }

  hostUpdate()?: void;
}

That hostUpdate signature is just to keep typescript from complaining. 🤷.
Our controller essentially bolts some statefullness onto a function which takes some state T and some action A and returns some other or the same state T. So let&#x27;s formalize that:
type Reducer &#x3D; (state: T, action: A) &#x3D;&gt; T;

The controller should take that reducer, along with some initial state, and pin them to the class instance.
export class ReducerController implements ReactiveController {
  public state: T;

  constructor(
    private host: ReactiveControllerHost,
    public reducer: Reducer,
    public initialState: T,
  ) {
    this.host.addController(this);
    this.state &#x3D; initialState;
  }

  hostUpdate?():void
}

Believe it or not we&#x27;re pretty much done. The last piece we need is to implement a dispatch method which takes an action A and updates the host.
dispatch(action: A): void {
  this.state &#x3D; this.reducer(this.state, action);
  this.host.requestUpdate();
}

And, as Chef John would say, that&#x27;s it!
If we want to use our controller, we just create it on a compatible host (like LitElement) and we&#x27;re off to the races:

                    <span>Introduction


This article will show you how to quickly create an ESP32 based &quot;smart device&quot;, using Arduino, by creating a simple application that basically connects your WiFi router, then a MQTT server, and publishes a message every five seconds.
Of course, you can use any other WiFi enabled board.
http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?Id&#x3D;1126
First, we need to add support to our ESP32 board.
In the Arduino preferences, in the Additional Boards Manager URLs field, add: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

In the Tools menu, open the Boards Manager and look for esp32, then install it.
Still in the Tools menu, choose your board (TTGO LoRa32-OLED V1 in my case)
In the Sketch menu, select Manage Libraries...

Install library PubSubClient

Installing RSpec, FactoryBot, Faker gems and configuring for testing environment. 
Ruby 3.0.1 + Rails 7.0.0
Let&#x27;s get right to it...
rails new projectname -d postgresql
cd projectname
git add -A
git commit -m &quot;initial commit&quot;

rails db:create
rails s

git checkout -b rspec

In Gemfile add...
group :development, :test do
  # See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#debugging-with-the-debug-gem
  gem &quot;debug&quot;, platforms: %i[ mri mingw x64_mingw ]
  gem &quot;rspec-rails&quot;
  gem &quot;factory_bot_rails&quot;
  gem &quot;faker&quot;
end

Back in terminal/command line...
bundle install
rails g rspec:install

Create &#x27;support&#x27; directory in &#x27;spec&#x27; directory and create two files
spec/support/factory_bot.rb
spec/support/chrome.rb

And then one file in the spec directory for factories.
spec/factories.rb

Configure FactoryBot
# spec/support/factory_bot.rb

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
end

Configure driver
# spec/support/chrome.rb

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:each, type: :system) do
    if ENV[&quot;SHOW_BROWSER&quot;] &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;true&quot;
      driven_by :selenium_chrome
    else
      driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome, screen_size: [1400, 1400]
    end
  end
end

Require support files in rails_helper.rb
# spec/rails_helper.rb

require_relative &#x27;support/factory_bot&#x27;
require_relative &#x27;support/chrome&#x27;

When you generate a User model (or any model) RSpec will generate a factory for you in your factories.rb file.
# spec/factories.rb

FactoryBot.define do
  factory(:user) do
    email { Faker::Internet.email }
    password { Faker::Internet.password }
  end
end

Run rspec command in the terminal and you should see it run and output some green text.

                    <span>Hiring a DevOps Engineer for the first time? Knowing what to look for in a talented engineer can be a challenge. In this article, I discuss what you can expect from a DevOps Engineer in today&#x27;s marketplace. I share some of my own experiences hiring DevOps Engineers in today&#x27;s competitive labor market. Finally, I talk about cheaper alternatives to hiring a full-time DevOps Engineer. 
In my past articles,  I&#x27;ve discussed DevOps release pipelines, stacks, and stages in-depth. A release pipeline is a software-driven process that development teams use to promote application changes from development into production. The pipeline creates multiple stacks - full versions of your application - across multiple stages of deployment.

                    <span>This is not some kind of paid promotion. Just that sometimes are curious about what other people use in a daily basis.
When I ask, I get different responses and is cool to have this variety.
So I present my favorite apps/software of the last year
A sleep and meditation app, has a ton of meditation exercises and calm music. Really an amazing app , i wish it has a better web app but for now it’s ok.
This password manager is really useful. By now it makes all that it needs to do. Also it has VPN, and a dark web email analyzer. It is a really great password manager.
It is a time tracker useful when working on different projects and clients. For me i use it to know how many time i spent on different topics.
Another time tracker, this really blows my mind. It can track without specifying some task. When i open my PC it begins to track, really useful.
This was the year i began to use linux. Ubuntu has make things easier in development, although i had audio related issues, and the os freeze sometimes.

                    <span>Have you ever wanted to create a Python package so you can type the following?
pip install my-awesome-package

If so, this tutorial is for you. 
Poetry is a system package you can use to very easily manage your Python Packages. 
It makes handling your packages super easy. I have 9 Python packages under my name, and this is by far the best solution. 
First, you need to install Poetry on your system. 
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -

(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -

Now you can type poetry --version to see the version you&#x27;re running. If this doesn&#x27;t work for you, try closing and re-openin…</span>

                    <span>Online courses are everywhere, and every day there are more. 
In a series of articles, I will explain my approach to online education. 
This is written in a personal way, maybe you can relate. It wasn&#x27;t always perfect, I was really slow and the start.
In my first year, I discover online courses, but I didn’t see it as a way that can help me at the time. 
I would only say to myself, this looks good but I don’t feel pressured to finish it, maybe someday, like when I am looking for a job I will have better reasons
As you may know, my way of thinking was not very mature, and it wasn’t because I was at school with so many hours and for me, it was not a big deal to finish.
The topics that interested me at the time were mainly programming and business. I enroll in 3 free udemy courses and paid for 3. I remember that I just completed 2 but because it was 2 hours or less, so no big deal.
As you may know, some Udemy Courses can get through 30 hours of content, and this makes it hard to finish. At the time I thought that more content meant that the course was better, but obviously, I was mistaken.
Finally, it is important to say that I just took courses from Spanish speakers instructors so as you may think, the offer was not very high back then.
This series will continue.

                    <span>What


The State is a Object where we store our values that belongs to the Component.
But what are Objects🤔 ??
So we have heard about the variables , they are the containers which used to store the data values.
Objects are also Variable but they can contain many values.
Like,
const car &#x3D;
{
    color:&quot;Red&quot;,
    Model:&quot;3&quot;,
    Name:&quot;Tesla&quot;
}

But we already have props then why we need the State.
Props used to pass data to Component but we can’t change the data once passed.
But state is used to store the Dynamic data .
It’s helps in making the Dynamic Web Application.
Also we need something which keep track what is happing in our Application.
State is Designed to Change in Response to the Event.

As u can see in the above example the uses of state.
We use state to find out like whether a use…</span>

                    <span>There’s a sad running gag in our industry: “Looking for junior developer with five years of experience.” (Examples: 2019, 2020, 2021.)
You can tell the contradiction: We can have close to no expectations of junior or, generally speaking, young and inexperienced developers.
Any expectations we do set change the profile we’re hiring for. To stick with the popular example, if we’re looking for someone with five years of experience, we’re looking for a medior. Not a junior. If we keep these expectations up insisting on hiring a junior, a working student, or even an intern, it gets ridiculous (and exploitative).

We’ve always known that the way colors are represented on a monitor doesn’t encompass the full width and breadth of colors that the human eye can perceive. As always, art is limited by the technology of the time – ages ago, color decisions were limited based on the relative expense of various dyes or paint colors to produce. That’s why purple is associated with royalty in many western cultures; purple dyes used to be quite expensive, so wearing purple clothes was a real flex! Similarly, early computers were limited to green text on a black background because the monochrome monitors used phosphor, and green phosphor was the brightest and had the longest afterglow (which helped disguise the low refresh rates). Heck, if you’ve been doing web design or development for a while, you p…</span>

When Evernote launched the idea of an online notebook as a sort of &quot;second brain&quot; more than a decade ago, it resonated so much with what I had been trying to achieve for a while. By then I already had tons of bookmarks, text files with read-it-later links, notes I had taken across multiple devices, sketches I had taken on physical paper and drafts of articles or papers I was working on. All of this content used to be sparse across many devices, it was painful to sync, and then Evernote came like water in a desert.
I have been a happy Evernote user until ~5-6 years ago, when I realized that the company had run out of ideas, and I could no longer compromise with its decisions. If Evernote was supposed to be my second brain then it should have been very s…</span>

I wrote this letter precisely a year ago, as a gift to myself.

There were some things I could not have envisioned and some things I was absolutely right about.
Let&#x27;s go through this together, shall we?
... reading my letter ...
It&#x27;s funny. I start with wanting to spend more time in nature, and I hope my past self is glad to hear we actually did spend a lot more time in nature and offline.
The big thing about the time when writing this letter was the travel bans, and one year later, we still have a lot of travel bans in place.
But needless to say, I&#x27;m writing this today from a tropical island, on which ironically enough, we got stuck 😂.

Why system design for Front-End?
Front-End is getting complex day by day.The line between Backend and Front-End is fading out. As well as, it is expected that Front-End should contribute to the design decisions of the project. Front-End developers should flag in the design meetings if Backend/APIs folks are ignoring any important aspect in the design.
What interviewers are looking for?
As a Front-End developer do you understand
How the application should be designed E2E?


What are the important parts of any application?


Do you understand which resource is the right fit and why


Do you understand the pros-cons of the design decisions

Hello Devs, if you want to learn Microsoft Azure in 2022 and looking for the best resources like online courses, books, tutorials, etc then you have come to the right place. 
Earlier, I have shared the best cloud computing courses and best free Azure courses but many of you asked for more comprehensive and in-depth Azure courses and here we are with the list of the 5 best Microsoft Azure courses in 2022.  
Microsoft Azure is, as the name implies, Microsoft&#x27;s answer to Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. What that means is that it provides a wide range of cloud services like computing, storage, analytics, and networking…</span>

Let&#x27;s start by creating an SST app.
$ npx create-serverless-stack@latest rest-api
$ cd rest-api

By default our app will be deployed to an environment (or stage) called dev and the us-east-1 AWS region. This can be changed in the sst.json in your project root.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;rest-api&quot;,
  &quot;stage&quot;: &quot;dev&quot;,

                    <span>Today, I got feedback from a code review and learned something new. It was about &quot;magic numbers&quot;, which are unique values with unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could (preferably) be replaced with named constants.
I&#x27;ve known about the concept of using constants rather than hard-coding values, but I didn&#x27;t think of that for &quot;magic number&quot; situations. It&#x27;s a pretty simple concept but I just wanted to share what I learned.

                    <span>A Progressive Web App requires a web app manifest, a JSON file that contains the details of your app (things like the name and icons of your PWA). 
An app manifest must have an array of icons. Each of these icons has a purpose set to either monochrome, any ormaskable or a combination of these three values.
Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a few PWA app manifests displaying a warning that until mid-2021 didn&#x27;t exist (those created with Progressier always work great though!): 
Declaring an icon with purpose &quot;any maskable&quot; is discouraged. It is likely to look incorrect on some platforms due to too much or too little padding.

We expose a single class Copy_With_Style that can be instantiated as follows in client side Javascript. For example:
const clipboard &#x3D; new Copy_With_Style({ button: document.getElementById(&quot;button_to_copy&quot;),

                    <span>CSS variables, also known as custom properties(official name) or cascading variables, are a useful CSS feature that allows you to set a value once and reference it many times throughout an HTML document. As with other programming languages, variables are a valuable tool that helps reduce redundant tasks and hold values that can be used or changed later. CSS variables were introduced in 2016 with the release of Chrome 49, and are now supported across all modern web browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer.
It will make writing and maintaining your CSS easier. Most websites have a color palette that is repeated throughout. Now imagine you have a website and want to change the color palette. In a complex website you&#x27;d have to update the colors in the many places it&#x27;s used. That is a t…</span>

                    <span>Greetings, everyone!
Just like every Tuesday, I had to go out for my physical therapy session, so I couldn&#x27;t work as much today. However, I still managed to get a decent amount of work done on my company webpage such as adding alternative contact methods in case the message form doesn&#x27;t work and adding a hover overlay on the portfolio project images that says &quot;View Project.&quot;


Anyway, let&#x27;s move on to my daily report!
I passed my Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam and got certified. Also, I planned out the work I&#x27;ll be doing for this week, mostly regarding the business page.
I added call-to-action for alternative contact methods, specifically email and phone number, if ever the contact form doesn&#x27;t work.
I placed a hover overlay on top of the portfolio project images.
read some articles about Scrum, particularly about the role expectations in an organization, as well as other people&#x27;s experiences of being a Developer and Scrum Master at the same time.
Thank you for reading! Have a good day!

How do you manage being a Scrum Master and Developer at the same time?
What can I expect my Scrum Master to do?

                    <span>研究人员“开源”免专利的新冠疫苗

由美国德克萨斯儿童医院和贝勒医学院的研究人员开发的新型新冠疫苗 Corbevax，正以无专利约束的形式提供给世界各地的疫苗制造商。人体试验证明该疫苗安全有效，印度已批准使用该疫苗，使该国的疫苗产量增加到每月超过 1 亿剂。该疫苗使用了一种传统的基于蛋白质的技术，这种技术已安全使用几十年，一直被用于生产乙型肝炎疫苗。该疫苗甚至比阿斯利康 Covishield 疫苗更好，对 Delta 变体有效性至少为 80%。


老王点评：或许这不是最有效的疫苗，但是更重要的是，它一个免专利的、可以让所有疫苗厂商生产制造的疫苗。




AI 的 6 种劣化情况

AI 专家称，不需要恶毒的独裁者，AI 就可能会自然而然地出现 6 种劣化情况，这包括：深度伪造等技术用虚假替代了现实；忽视了数据安全和对社会造成的危害；被用来进行监控和跟踪；算法定义了人类所接受的信息；AI 自身的局限性和偏见造成的限制；过度监管限制了 AI 带来的好处。


老王点评：我觉得这些能认识到的问题其实都还属于可以解决的问题，倒也不必杞人忧天。




哈勃太空望远镜已运行超 10 亿秒

虽然詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜已经开始了它的漫长部署过程，但 1990 年 4 月 25 日从发现号航天飞机的货舱中展开的哈珀望远镜已经运行 31 年多了。这台望远镜在2021 年 1 月 1 日超过了 10 亿秒大关，目前已经进行了超过 150 万次的科学观测。哈珀望远镜的设计寿命是 15 年寿命，虽然不大可能再运行 10 亿秒了，但是 NASA 希望它还可以坚持几年。


老王点评：缝缝补补又三年，这几年 NASA 为了让它恢复工作，简直是操尽了心。</span>

                    <span>英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中引入一个特殊的变化，可以在不重启系统的情况下更新系统固件。




去年发现的几个安全漏洞，使得系统管理员很难在不停机的情况下迅速修补系统。

如果能做出一些改进，在不重启系统的情况下更新一些关键组件以提高安全/性能呢？

英特尔旨在通过其新的 PFRUT（平台固件运行时更新和遥测Platform Firmware Runtime Update and Telemetry）驱动程序来实现这一目标。

英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中提供 PFRUT

虽然 Linux 内核 5.16 将在本周晚些时候发布，不过英特尔的目标是将这一新的功能合并到即将发布的 Linux 内核 5.17 稳定版。

但是，它究竟是什么？

有了 PFRUT 驱动，特定组件（或系统固件）可以在系统运行时进行更新，而不需要重新启动。

最初，英特尔倾向于将其称为“无缝更新”解决方案。然而，随着最近被添加到 Linux 电源管理的 linux-next 分支中的 Linux 内核提交，他们可能会继续使用一个厂商中立的名字，即 pfrut_driver。

顺便说一句，linux-next 分支代表着这些变化将进入下一个 Linux 内核稳定版（5.17）。

在技术上，这个 提交 对该变化的解释如下：


用户应该提供 EFI 封包，并通过将该封包写入设备的特殊文件以将其传递给驱动程序。驱动程序在特定的 ACPI 平台固件运行时更新ACPI Platform Firmware Runtime Update设备（INTC1080）的 ACPI _DSM 方法的帮助下，将封包传输到平台固件，而实际的固件更新是由平台固件中的低级管理模式代码进行的。


就像人们通常期望的那样，这应该可以消除停机时间，可以对解决任何安全和性能改进的固件进行基本更新。而且，系统固件更新可以很容易地直接通过操作系统（这里是 Linux）进行。

正如其中一个 详细说明其工作原理的 PDF 文件 中强调的那样，驱动程序的遥测部分是为了 “从 MM 中检索日志信息，以进行监控并找出问题的根本原因”。

请注意，这只有在 Linux 系统和英特尔芯片上才能实现。

考虑到当你需要修补系统固件以抵御安全问题时，等待系统上的任务完成不是一种理想状况，这种能力的增加应该是非常方便的。

这是为 Linux 桌面或服务器准备的吗？

该改进主要是为服务器专用硬件量身定做的。

英特尔的官方文件指出，这是为具有高服务水平协议（SLA）的系统准备的，这种 SLA 需要尽量减少重启。

然而，这对拥有企业级系统的特定桌面用户群应该也是有用的。

虽然这可能不是桌面 Linux 发行版必不可少的东西，但它可能是改善用户体验的一个令人兴奋的开始。特别是对于热衷于保持系统固件更新而不严重干扰其工作的用户。

这也应该可以引入更多类型的更新的可能性，当涉及到 BIOS 或 UEFI 时，可以由操作系统而不是主板处理。

这不仅限于为你的桌面配置服务器级别的硬件的 Linux 桌面用户。

虽然目前只限于 Linux 系统，但这也应该很快可以用于 Windows 和其他操作系统。

你对英特尔推出的这一变化有何看法？你认为这是对系统固件更新处理方式的一个重大改进吗？

欢迎在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

                    <span>这组文章展示了企业如何与开源软件连接。




开源软件不仅仅创造了专有软件的替代品。在商业方面，开源已经成为一个“力量的倍增器”来改变组织的经营方式。同时，越来越多的公司开始采用更多的开源方法，甚至在管理团队和流程方面。

在过去的一年里，我们发表了许多优秀的文章，展示了企业如何与开源软件相联系。以下是一些阅读量最大的文章：

《开源给你带来竞争优势的 4 种方式》

为了在当今快节奏的世界中取得成功，企业必须对数字解决方案进行明智的投资，使他们能够更快地行动并提高运营的灵活性。这正是越来越多的各种规模和各种行业的组织拥抱开源解决方案的原因。根据麦肯锡的一份报告，开源的采用是表现优异的组织的最大差异化因素。Jason Blais 写了采用开源技术可以帮助组织推动竞争优势和体验更好的业务成果的 四个原因。

《为什么 Crate.io 回归其纯粹的开源根源》

开源技术提供企业级的可扩展性、性能、安全性和可靠性。信任就在那里，而且是当之无愧的。但除了顽固的开源信徒之外，较少被人称道的是日常社区贡献的内部运作，在原子级别建立了这些宏观利益。对于那些提供开源技术的人来说，社区不断的用户驱动的测试和加固将这些技术锻造成强大和成熟的解决方案。Crate.io 的联合创始人 Bernd Dorn 写道，该组织从“开放核心” 转变 为采用 Apache 2.0 许可的纯开源。

《为什么非营利组织选择开源软件》

随着科技和数据安全意识的提高，开源软件比以往任何时候都更成为各阶层组织的首选。非营利组织在财务方面尤其脆弱，同时又要处理重要的社会和环境问题。Michael Korotaev 以 Nextcloud 和 ONLYOFFICE为 例，写了关于在非营利组织中 采用开源协作技术 的文章。

《管理开源产品路线图》

客户，以及与他们交谈的销售和营销团队，都喜欢一个路线图。它让他们了解什么是现实的，什么是不现实的。路线图也是一个产品的核心。Scott McCarty 写了关于 管理开源产品路线图 的文章，以及为什么专有产品的路线图与建立在开源供应链上的产品没有什么不同。产品经理与客户交谈，对他们的需求进行排序，制定路线图，然后找出如何通过建设、购买和合作来提供能力。

《将开源产品推向市场》

产品营销和计划中的信息传递的作用对于一个成功的发布至关重要。Scott McCarty 继续他关于开源供应链中的产品管理的系列文章，讨论了 开源和产品营销的交叉点。

                    <span>使用场景
一年之计在于春。元旦已过，新春将至，是时候投入到新一年的规划中。为此，不妨用些可量化的方式提醒时光易逝，激励自己珍惜时间——比如不时算算「今年过去了百分之几」。
当然，这么简单的问题并不需要依赖那些营销号帮我们做算术；利用自带的快捷指令，完全可以做到随手查看年度百分比，顺便还能画出一个「年度进度条」。
使用步骤
下载：年度百分比
下载后直接运行即可。你也可以直接说「嘿 Siri，年度百分比」来运行。

制作思路
如上所述，这个快捷指令要解决的问题并不困难，但问题是很容易做得繁琐。加上快捷指令的操作至今不算特别方便，如果思路不清晰，很容易在步骤堆积之后手忙脚乱。
为此，我们首先根据预期的输出结果——年度百分比和年度进度条——对该快捷指令所需的功能进行分解，可以大致拆分出如下问题：

如何获取当前日期与年初的天数差值；
如何计算已经过天数占全年天数的百分比，进而转化为进度条；
如何汇总和输出结果。

下面分别介绍本快捷指令的解决思路。
如何获取当前日期与年初的天数差值
对于这个问题，最简单粗暴的方法当然是获取当前日期、构造一个当年 1 月 1 日的日期，然后用「获取时长」的步骤求差值。但以上三步其实可以通过一步来实现。这里的技巧在于，快捷指令中的日期变量都是可以自行指定格式的，并且可以在格式表述中将特定的日期部件改为固定值。
具体而言，我们将「获取时长」步骤的前后两个空位都选为「当前日期」。然后，选择前一个日期（起始日期），将其「日期格式」改为「自定」，然后在下方输入yyyy-01-01。其中，yyyy 是 ISO-8601 标准下的「年」变量，这种格式意味着所得结果的年份随实际年份而变，但月和日则固定为 1 月 1 日。后一个日期（结束日期）保持不变，即输出当前的年月日。
这样一来，这个「获取时长」步骤的输出结果直接就是今天与年初的天数差值。

如何绘制进度条

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人：
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

自我介绍环节
大家好，我是 214，一名自由摄影师。我已经发表的作品有《晚风》《下河》和《离婚之后》等，目前还在继续拍摄新的照片和项目。

分享一件你印象最深刻的、关于 2021 年的记忆吧
我奶奶过世。
你过去的一年你最长待的一个城市在哪里？你在这个地方有发生一些什么故事和经历吗？
我最近住在贵州的关岭，但是我想推荐贵州的紫云县，它是一个宗教气氛比较浓的地方。它处于贵州比较罕见的地震带上，所以它的喀斯特的地貌就会非常的明显。我和张文心去了很多次紫云，那里有很多原始的山洞，没有人工的灯光，很好玩、很有趣，如果有机会大家可以去一下。
如果让你用一个词概括自己的 2021 年，你会用什么词？
懒吧，我今年比较懒。
谈谈你的年度照片吧
也不能说它是年度照片，但是看这个问题之后，我就想到了这张。照片里那个西瓜是我给他们，因为买了没有吃完，所以正好他们在旁边洗澡，说给他们分一点，他们就拿去分给其他的小伙伴吃。

谈谈你的你的年度的书籍、电影或者音乐吧
书的话推荐汪曾祺的小说；电影我推荐《灵媒》和《南巫》。这两部都挺不错，一个是纯粹的恐怖片，一个则带一点社会议题，它们的影像的呈现方式和我之前拍过的一些照片非常像；音乐我推荐 Kanye West 的新专辑。

推荐一个你的年度好物
我买的新电脑 MacBook Air。我以前的电脑连我现在用 A7R4 拍的 RAW 都处理不了，打不开。PS 点开以后要等半小时，很痛苦。新电脑很顺畅，节约了很多时间。
展望一下你的 2022 年吧
2022 年我要出一本新书。我把我以前拍的照片整合了一下，做成一本书，它和《下河》《晚风》不太一样，它更加随机，更像我生活中的那种随手拍，不以项目或者系列为前提。但是我想了一个线索，把它们整合起来，做成一本书。

这个冬天，我从居住了快一年的大理动身回到了东南老家。因为原定的日程被疫情打断，于是在家要待的时长比起计划来要多出很久。我想不如趁着这个机会，来给老家的孩子们上一些课吧。联络了几位在老家教书的同学，成功招募到了五位基础很棒的小学生，定好时间来参加训练。又有在香港的师妹帮我召集了五位正在念 IB 课程的初中生，约定时间上远程课。
「讲课」之类的事情，我在各种不同的场景里都做过。年轻的时候去北大找朋友们玩，可以随便找个空教室借黑板粉笔一用，大谈例如三国吴时的鼓吹曲之类话题。后来落拓江湖，有时候合作方也会带着一些 MBA 学员，来体验一次「设计入门」。这一类的讲课都是对着成年人，想讲什么就讲什么，无需顾虑正误。但这次是给孩子们上课，这样子随随便便可不行。因此，哪怕是两手空空，既无教室，又无专门的设备，也还是得想法子解决才行。一番折腾，其中体验突然让我觉得很有趣，于是写成本文。由于这个课程的地点时常变动，我把它叫做游牧教室。
这篇文章跟之前介绍「学问入门课」的系列不同，着重记述一点实际动手的体验，尤其希望能够帮助到读者当中为人父母或老师的诸位。
我所知道的那些上课方法
世界上有许多种上课的方法，有时候相差极大。比如说习惯了学校——教室、老师——黑板(或投影屏幕）这种配置的人，就很难想象到《星球大战》电影当中尤达大师到底是怎样教导卢克·天行者原力的奥秘与技巧的，既没有教科书（或者说明书），又没有思维导图（拆书稿、大纲），甚至连口头指导都只有寥寥无几的几句话（还是倒装的，这些话）。上述两位都是「绝地武士」，他们的古老对手「西斯」其实也差不多。在…</span>

谷歌搜索 「Android 优化工具」，你会找到很多与此相关的内容。他们的问题在于要么是内容高度重复、要么是直接讲使用方法，很少会给你介绍整体性的架构，一不小心就会让人会种「一个工具搞定一切」的错误认知。以笔者团队的多年经验来看，在性能分析领域这种银弹级别的工具是不存在的。工具在发展，老问题会以新的方式变样出现，不掌握核心逻辑的话始终会让你浮于技术的表面。 
本文首先系统性的梳理性能分析中的可观测性技术，它涵盖数据类型、抓取方法以及分析方法等三部分内容，之后是介绍谷歌提供的「三大件」分析工具。目的是想让你了解不变的理论性的知识，以及与之对应的在安卓环境中可用的工具，这些可以让你少走一些弯路，直接复用前辈们的经验。 
需要特别说明的是，对于性能优化肯定不止有这三个工具可用，但这个三个工具是我们平时用到的「第一手工具」。进行进一步分析之前，你都需要依赖这三个工具进行瓶颈定位，之后才应不同领域特性选择对应的工具进行下钻分析。</span>

靠着长达一年的马屁，我成了导师的得意门生。
谁料，我却在庆功宴上喝多，当众亲了他儿子。
1.
我的研究生导师，是业界响当当的大牛。
一年多的鞍前马后，我终于成了他的“得意门生”。
但就在一场庆功宴上，我喝高了。
“明教授，有这样的成果全仰仗您的指导，您就是我再生父亲。啊不，亲爸爸。”
导师也喝了不少，没和我计较。
所以晕晕乎乎的我转向了他一旁安静吃菜的儿子：“明奕。”
对方诧异地转过头挑了挑眉。
“得空多替我谢谢咱爸。”
此话一出，四座皆惊。
只有当事人仍然淡定，轻轻一笑，微点了点头。
然后，我一时忘形，俯下身捧着他的脸吻了上去。
第二天早上，头脑仍有些昏昏沉沉的我打开微信，看到置顶消息顿时清醒：
“唐倩，解释一下昨天晚上跟我儿子的事情。”
我心凉了。
老师，我说我馋他很久了，会被您开除吗？
2.
在这次社死之前，我发誓，我原本的形象一直都是内向文静的。
直到遇到明奕才破了功。
一年前那场沉闷尴尬的破冰宴，在他到来的一刻全然变了景象。
“各位别客气，全部由明教授买单。”
我原本正扮隐形人，手里却莫名被塞了一份菜单。
“学妹喜欢吃什么啊？这个虾怎么样？”这个剑眉星目的浓颜帅哥自来熟得仿佛小区相亲角的大妈。
“都，都行。”
我向来都不擅长跟陌生人交际，瞬间红了脸。
他自问自答着在我身边落座，又去招呼其他人，靠着无比强大的社交技能带动了全场的氛围。
后来，我们甚至互相敬起了酒。
3.
饭后玩真心话大冒险时，我比先前放松了不少，但抽中“亲在场任意异性一口”还是原地石化。
周围人看到我瞬间面色又变得通红，愈发来了劲，起哄催我抓紧。
“我豁出去了。”明奕伸手点了点我肩膀，微微一笑，“我不跟你们导师，多半见不到，不怕尴尬。”
“快快快亲一个！”
于是，我眼睛一闭，横下心，嘴唇在他脸颊一侧轻轻一印。
接近他的那一刻，鼻端被一阵似有似无的薄荷香气萦绕。只是短短的一瞬，却好像在分开…</span>

A lot of those people are choosing software as their next career. You may even be among them.
Why software?
There is a myriad of reasons why people choose to enter software development:
The joy of creating things from scratch
The thrill of problem solving
The lifelong journey of continuing education
and...
There is a lot of money to be made in the field.

Data from 2018 already showed that the average software developer earned 3 times more than other working individuals in the United States.
Yet, entering software as a second career developer can often be overwhelming and intimidating.

When you code in a Django web framework, we all know that you won’t directly work with databases. There is an ORM (Object relational mapping) who will interact with database using migration and SQL operation. So, I want in this tutorial to show you how to implement an ORM manager from scratch.
Object–relational mapping (ORM) in computer science is a technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages in order to create virtual database objects.
Python is a programming language that enables you to design freely anything that you want.
And honestly I was able to implement a Mini ORM manager merely within 3 hours.

                    <span>Observability


If you do software-as-a-service development and you have paying customers, you at some point learn about the need for operational monitoring and observability. Personally, I went through a process something like this:
Service has some basic logging and an uptime alert.
Service has a health-check endpoint, is deployed in triplicate behind a load balancer.
Logs are real-time shipped to Splunk / ELK Stack.
Metrics set up in Datadog / Prometheus with paging.
Distributed Tracing set up for debugging across services.
And so on.
Each step requires more work to set up and has some additional benefits. I moved through each step by necessity as my service handled more requests and became more important to customers.

                    <span>DragonRuby Game Toolkit (DRGTK) is a 2D game engine built with mRuby, SDL, and LLVM. It&#x27;s meant to be tiny, fast, and allow you to turn out games quickly using Ruby.
Unfortunately, since the documentation is focused on making games quickly, I sometimes get lost when trying to figure out how to do things that should be simple. DragonRuby seems to have borrowed Perl&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s more than one way to do it&quot; philosophy because for anything you want to do with the API there are several ways to do it.
The documentation and examples tend to focus on the simplest forms (which is fine) but then require digging and experimentation to figure out the rest.
To help explain/document the different API options, this post will go through different methods of rendering images (well, rectangles mostly).

setInterval() repeatedly calls a function with a fixed time delay between each call. So you can utilize to do something like I mentioned above (producing x amount of resources every x seconds) or for animations! You can use it in a way to have your picture move from one position to the other every x amount of seconds (hint hint... you might maybe see this in our upcoming project). 
Let&#x27;s get into how to use setInterval() in your code now.

                    <span>React fragments were a feature released in React 16.2. They have been around for a while now but have been a relatively lesser used feature. Let us explore the what and why the feature exists.
React fragments are a syntax addition to React that allow wrapping or grouping of multiple HTML elements without the need for any additional DOM nodes. We mostly come across this situation when a React component needs to return multiple elements.
The traditional approach has been to wrap them in a div element because a React component can return only one element. This behavior results in useless additional markup and also makes the DOM tree heavy with additional layers of divs.
The traditional solution to render 3 child components in a single component would have been:
const App &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {

Go to the Azure App service instance, find the Configuration in the Settings tab, select Application Settings section.


Here are two kinds of it. Application Settings and Connection Strings. There is only one case for using strings instead of settings, more detailed information can be found by the link. Use Application settings and click on +New application setting.

Hello👋 Its Rohan Kadam😊
Maybe you are a newbie to coding👩‍💻 or programming, maybe experienced👴 or maybe a FrontEnd Developer or BackEnd Developer you all have may have come across the word Design Pattern as a principle or as a concept. The design pattern is a way or approach to writing code or developing an application. In this article, we try to answer certain questions What is Design Pattern? Why implement a design pattern? How to implement a Design pattern (Factory)?

Design patterns are the solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-fabricated blueprints that we can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
They are not pieces of code or libraries that can be imported and used in the development of software or …</span>

                    <span>What are the most important unsupervised machine learning algorithms?


In this blog post, we will list what we believe to be the top 8. 
Unsupervised machine learning means that there is no predefined outcome or label for any data point during training. Without a labeled data set, how does one know which algorithm should be used? There are many possible answers to this question and it all depends on the type of problem you need to solve.
The goal of this blog post is to help you figure out which unsupervised machine learning algorithm is best for your problem. We will provide a brief overview and examples as well as details about which algorithms are better suited for specific types of data sets.
Top unsupervised machine learning algorithms include:

                    <span>Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that deals with the study of computational algorithms and statistical models to perform tasks through patterns and interference instead of explicit tasks. The machine (Your computer) takes in the data and algorithm, learns from it, and then could use it to predict for other new instances. Machine learning is a set of tools used to build models on data that could help predict new types of the same data. Machine learning models are now very popular everywhere.

But nowadays companies need the fastest way to develop native apps. To develop native apps, we must know JAVA for android and SWIFT for ios which waste our time. React native and flutter give us the advantage to write a single code and deploy it to various platforms.
From a single codebase in a flutter, we create natively-compiled apps for mobile and desktop. Google has recently developed cross-platform mobile app development. Dart is the programming language used by flutter. It enables the creation of expressive and flexible user interfaces with native performance.

                    <span>新的插件可以防止从网上复制代码

JetBrains 发布了一个 AntiCopyPaster 开源插件，可以防止复制和粘贴代码。研究人员观察到，虽然“复制和粘贴构成了编写代码的一个重要部分”，但这样做会导致代码维护、安全问题和许可证问题。由于开发者倾向于抄袭，有很多重复的代码在四处飘荡。截至 2017 年，GitHub 上约有 70% 的代码 来自复制的文件。AntiCopyPaster 会监控 IDE 中的粘贴代码，并扫描目标文件中的 Java 方法以找出重复的内容。该插件在粘贴操作后会等待一段时间，以允许对复制的代码进行编辑。只有当克隆的代码没有被改变时，该插件才会继续检查粘贴的片段是否原样复制的代码。


老王点评：看来以后 ICP 程序员难混咯。




阿里巴巴为 Linux 内核调度器提出组平衡器概念

越来越多的组织为了发展云计算等业务而配置他们的服务器在应用程序之间共享 CPU 核心/资源，而不是将某个 CPU 核心专门分配给单个应用程序/任务。阿里巴巴为 Linux 内核调度器提出一个新的“组平衡器”概念，以提升系统资源利用。这个平衡器的重点是在各组 CPU 核心之间平衡各组任务。这是一种缓解共享模式下冲突的方法，使组尽可能地排他，以获得性能和资源效率。在一台 128 核 CPU 服务器上的基准测试发现，与标准共享模式相比，Redis 在组平衡器模式下可以提升 2~10% 的性能。


老王点评：现在越来越多的看到了中国开发者在内核前沿做出更深入的探索和研究。




夸大其词的 CleanCache 补丁将在十年后从 Linux 内核中删除

CleanCache 是由 Oracle 开发的，在推出时他们宣称它是“非常酷的东西，有巨大的潜力超级优化运行的虚拟机的性能，是相当多的研究和实验的结果。”它有可能在许多环境中以可忽略的成本大幅提高许多工作负载的页面缓存效率。十年后的今天，CleanCache 已经没有任何内核代码在使用它们了，因此，它很可能在 Linux 5.17 中 被主线移除。


老王点评：这种新陈代谢挺好，要不 Linux 内核越来越臃肿了。</span>

                    <span>随着最新版本的发布，Pinta 终于带来了视觉上的更新和改进、移植到了 GTK 3 和 .NET 6。




新的一年的一周，你是否正在期待一些最新的开源应用发布。

你很幸运，Pinta 在新年前就宣布了他们的重大升级版本。

Pinta 是一个轻量级的绘画应用，可以作为一个简单的图像编辑工具。作为 顶级开源绘画应用 之一，Pinta 的新版本将其基础转移到 GTK3 和 .NET 6，并带来了一些新的功能和用户界面改进。

它是一个跨平台的开源应用程序，可用于 Linux、Windows 和 MacOS。

让我们来看看 Pinta 2.0 提供了什么。

有什么新变化？



GTK3 移植

如上所述，Pinta 现在已经被移植到了 GTK3，应该可以支持 GTK3 主题。虽然这可能不会带来巨大的变化，但作为一个 Linux 的原生应用程序，肯定会对体验有所改善。

GTK 对话框和小工具也得到了相应的调整。这包括增加了 GTK 字体选择器，取代了旧的文本工具，并使用了平台原生的文件对话框。

用户界面的改进

在用户界面方面，有许多变化和改进。其中一些包括：


使用 HiDPI 显示器的用户或许遇到的问题更少

一些工具现在使用旋转按钮而不是组合框

可以在状态栏上查看位置、缩放和调色板等信息

调色板现在显示最近使用的颜色

使用鼠标中键，你可以轻松地缩放和平移画布

取消了 “插件” 和 “最近打开” 菜单项


如果你使用 macOS，你可以注意到它使用了全局菜单而不是应用程序菜单，使其看起来更干净。

其他改进措施

这个版本还改进了油漆桶、选择工具和魔杖工具的性能，也修复了大量的错误。

Windows 和 macOS 版本也得到了改进和更新。

你可以参考 官方发布说明 了解更多技术细节。

下载 Pinta 2.0

我觉得将 Pinta 移植到 GTK3 的决定会受到用户的欢迎，但由于 GTK 4.0 已经崭露头角，是否有点太晚了？让我们拭目以待。

总的来说，这个版本为用户的桌面外观提供了统一性。Pinta 2.0 看起来是一个做了有益改进的可靠版本。

你可以以 Flatpak、Snap、Tarball 等以及其它用于 Linux 的软件包格式下载 Pinta 2.0。

Windows 和 macOS 用户可以使用各自的安装程序，现在它捆绑了所有必要的依赖，如 GTK 和 .NET / Mono。

                    <span>无论你在寻找什么工具，都有大量的开源软件的替代品供你选择。




2021 年又是一个主要在网上度过的年份，但这对开源世界来说并不新鲜。在任何地方工作的能力是我们的 DNA，在大流行之前，远程工作就已经进入了主流。

然而，今年在屏幕前的所有时间使我们的社区考虑开源的替代方案。无论你需要什么样的工具，许多流行的供应商都不是你唯一的选择。

如果你对 Zoom 感到厌倦，想要一个非 Salesforce 家的 CRM，或者想要一个非谷歌的分析工具，请继续阅读。我们有推荐了 2021 年最受读者喜爱的开源替代品的文章。

我最喜欢的开源项目管理工具

如果你在管理一个项目，可能看起来你有无穷无尽的工具可以选择。随着甘特图跨入敏捷领域，现在更常见的是看到它们被部署在大型项目的服务中。

如果你认为微软 Project 是你唯一的选择，别担心，Frank Bergmann 分享了几个 开源替代品，供单个用户计划和跟踪大型单一项目。Redmine、ProjectLibre 和 TaskJuggler 都是这个列表中涉及的开源替代品。

微软 Exchange 的一个开源替代品

微软 Exchange 在群件中的主导地位可能即将结束。2020年，一位奥地利的开源开发者建立了 grommunio，作为 Exchange 的开源替代品。

在 Markus Feilner 的 对 grommunio 的评论中，他分享了该工具提供的大量功能清单。集成的原生 exchange 协议使 Outlook 和智能手机能够像连接到 Exchange 一样连接到 grommunio。在这个强大的列表中，日历管理、视频会议和会议功能是由 Jitsi 提供的。

                    <span>Pixelmator Photo 在问世之初仅仅是一个图片编辑工具，在浩如烟海的同类 App 中并没有什么竞争的优势。不过，随着 Pixelmator Photo 在更新到 2.0 版本后拥有了全新设计的照片浏览器，而 iPhone 版本也获得了桌面级的图片编辑体验，这样的双重身份让它在我的首屏拥有了一席之地，甚至替代了系统相册的位置，让我在同一个 App 中就可以完成对图片的一站式处理。

宛如原生，「果」味十足
在 2.0 版本中，Pixelmator Photo 的照片浏览器经过了全新的设计，乍一看，和 iOS 系统原生的照片 App 可以说是如出一辙。不管是在第一个标签页「所有照片」还是在第二个标签页「相簿」，很多时候我都分不清自己到底是在使用 Pixelmator Photo 还是照片 App，所以在 UI 设计上 Pixelmator Photo 的照片浏览器做到了和 iOS 系统的高度统一。
上：照片 App；下：Pixelmator Photo。
在交互方面，Pixelmator Photo 也与系统照片 App 有非常多的相似之处：长按图片可以呼出右键菜单，「选择」模式下滑动可以多选图片，双击图片放大/缩小局部……

另外，Pixelmator Photo 可以通过「收藏」按钮将图片添加至「收藏」标签页，用来作为一个筛选机制也是一个不错的用法。

技术不够，AI 来凑
Pixelmator Photo 最大的卖点之一，就是从同门兄弟 Pixelmator Pro 那里继承了很多通过人工智能实现的实用功能。在移动平台上编辑图片，便捷是核心，而这些 AI 技术帮助我们可以在 iPhone 上快速出图。
点击任意图片进入编辑界面，就可以看到不少 AI 技术的身影。首先，右上…</span>

                    <span>想要深入使用 Notion 数据库，函数一定是绕不开的话题。它有点像 Excel 里的公式，根据几个单元格的值计算出一个新值，又有点像一些编程语言。12 月 18 日，theBlock 联合 Notion 中文社区举办了一次「和我一起写函数 • Write Formulas With Me」线上直播活动。我们针对宣传期间的问卷调查结果，期望可以让大家收获一些学习函数的方法和解决问题的思路。如果你错过了直播，那不妨跟随我们的文字版记录，一起探索 Notion 数据库函数吧～
函数可以做什么
在 Notion 数据库中新建一列，将属性类型修改为函数（Formula），点击这一列任意一格就会弹出函数编辑窗口，输入 1+1 然后点击 Done，就完成了一个函数的编写，这一列所有值都会显示为 2。

这就是一个简单的函数，但我们显然不满足于让一列函数只显示相同的结果，因此，我们可以调用这个数据库中其他的属性，作为函数属性的值，只需要用 prop(&quot;属性名称&quot;) 即可。例如在这个水果价格表中，直接用 prop(&quot;单价&quot;) 获得单价属性的值，你也可以直接在函数编辑窗左侧的选项中点击或回车来插入。

既然可以调用其他属性，我们就能用函数来实现一些运算：例如想要获得每种水果的总价，我们知道只需要 单价 * 数量 即可，因此 prop(&quot;单价&quot;) * prop(&quot;数量&quot;) 就能获得每种水果的总价。

这就是一个简单的函数例子，我们对于每一行不同的水果，对不同的单价和数量，用一个相同的函数，得到了每种水果的总价。Notion 数据库中的函数（Formula）就是用相同方法解决多个同类问题。数据库的每一行都是一个独立的问题，但可以用同一个函数解决。不止是数字，文本、日期等等，Notion 中有非常多的函数来解决各种问题。
函数应该怎么写
写好函数，需要遵循一定的语法格式，我们首先来看看函数的组成。…</span>

🍰 Android 13 前瞻

现在聊起 Android 13 更新确实是太早了，毕竟开始大范围推送 Android 12 更新的手机厂商两只手都能数过来，现在就开始聊关于 Android 13 的更新动态可能确实有点 …… 早。
但随着新一年已经到来，下一个 Android 测试版本预计也会在二月至三月期间发布：今年的 Android 12 早在二月初爆出重要渲染图：证实了两个关键更新 —— Material You 主题取色系统以及大改版的桌面小组件系统的存在。甚至还从某种程度上印证了 Pixel 6 的 ID 设计。
关联阅读：具透 | Android 12 来了：首个开发者预览版都有这些看点
即使在首个 Android 12 正式版发布之后这份曝光的可信度都存疑，但如今回顾，这份曝光中的几乎所有新功能都已经在 Android 12 最终正式版中出现。

说回 Android 13：从去年年底开始，我们就看到了来自多个信源的 Android 13 功能曝光：不仅有对于目前 Android 12 锁屏时钟样式的重新设计、还有关于蓝牙音频传输协议的功能加入，在 Android 12 大幅改进原生 UI 之后，Android 13 将重新聚焦于更多功能上的细枝末节。
从来自其中一份曝光来看，Android 13 正在开发一项代号为「Panlingual」的新功能…</span>

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

介绍一下你自己
你好吗！新年快乐！我是熊小默，一个视频创作者和短片导演。

我以前做过杂志主编，呆过互联网公司，发过当艺术家的梦，但目前占据我生活最大块的是旅行和拍摄。我对设计史和摄影史很感兴趣，收藏珍版唱片和机械钟表，我的视频也太多围绕设计、艺术和流行文化展开。
为什么喜欢机械表、怎么想到要做一档关于机械表的视频栏目？
现在很多人把表看作是展现身份的奢侈品，一种阶层符号。但作为一个从初中开始就迷恋钟表的人，我把它看作机械奇迹。时间本身是不可客观度量的，但钟表能把它等块切分，靠的只是齿轮咬合。而在我们人类历史的很长一段时间里，报时的权力属于国王或教会，现代钟表则是把这种权力交还给普通人。

我有一档视频栏目叫《HAND ON》，就是希望以诗歌化的语言，唯美的微观画面，来和大家分享在设计或历史意义上有值得一提之处的腕表。
 
2021 年让你印象深刻的腕表或相关品牌？
有几块风格迥异的腕表我很喜欢：
HUBLOT 和村上隆的新一代合作款。

OMEGA 的多用途计时器超霸 Chronoscope 腕表。

宝珀的 5008D 无辐射版五十噚。

希望通过《拍照的人》系列传达什么样的观点或者思考？
《拍照的人》这组短片是想去纪录全国各地在拍照的年轻人，他们对于摄影有全新的理解，也把它用作不同于以往的表达手段。
  
在系列短片里，我很有意地避开「摄影师」这三个字，因为我不想把拍照这件事塑造成为职业化的，需要特殊训练的，有天赋才艺的人才能做的事。我希望展现拍照这个动作里直觉、本能、生活化的特质。

拍照是每个现代年轻人命中注定的行为，只不过我希望这组短片能给大家一些寻找表达出口的启发。另外，这组短片也是希望密切地和地理发生关系的，能展现主人公和他们的家乡的关联。我们去了黔南、辽西、山西、潮汕地区、黑龙江，就是为了分享这种地理的差异性如何启发拍照。
推荐 3 位你最喜欢的视频博主？
@cbvivi、@苏兆阳Sudo、@flypig。
从眼镜到腕表再到数码产品，你推荐过很多精美有趣的物件，你平时出门会带或者常用哪些装备？
表我肯定会戴，我可以做到连续七周每天换表不重样。
照相机我一般也会带，有拍摄工作时带 FX3，没有工作时我会带徕卡（但是是胶卷相机，而不是那台花了我很多钱的 M10-R black paint，非常让人失望的粗制滥造产品，买来基本没用）。还有润唇膏和耳塞，我基本时时刻刻在听点有的没的。

推荐 3 样你的年度好物，并简单说说理由。
DJI 新出的麦克风，非常好用，我们现在录播客已经全面改用这款无线麦了。

永璞咖啡的榛果味胶囊，我的年度最大发现，便宜好喝香，泡起来很简单。
Astell &amp; Kern 的蓝牙音箱 Acro BE100，很美、很动听，还不贵。

用一个词概括你的 2021 年，为什么？
半空半满。
我今年做了很多让自己骄傲的项目，但是呢，又感觉它们其实本来也在我能力之内，并没有太多进步。
对于新的一年有哪些期待？
希望2022可以学到、看到全新的东西。增加生命体验。

游记：从坏运气开始，在满意中归家
坏运气的依旧
在出发前的一个月，我自己都觉得运气十分差。虽然只是我的感觉，但似乎真的有许多事情都没办法正常完成。往往都是十分难受。于是这俩月我的口头几乎都离不了「运气差」。
许多事情做不成，心情有些低落，加上一段时间没有什么「好消息」光顾，也显得精神上有些疲惫。于是想要出门转运就成了一个合适的借口。
临行前一周，突发高烧。因为肠胃原因发烧，所以还是清醒的，但是难受却也是久违的难受。已经多年没有这样烧过了，不敢去医院，也只能在家养着。加上一直在吃药，饮食方面也有许多忌口，于是这一周也就变得十分煎熬与悲伤。
吃不下东西，也消化不动，除了卧倒休息等待自然好转，似乎也没有任何更好的办法。
出发前三天，终于做了决定定了票。此时一查，余票两张，出不了门的定律要在这里打破——好家伙，买完票又窜回 39 度⋯⋯
心态几近崩溃，甚至已经想直接放弃退票了，毕竟不到 48 小时的出发时限就在那里。
有些时候，下定了决心还是有用的，第二天晚上，恰逢 F1 意大利大奖赛。虽然提起精神来看比赛，但脑子还是顶不住这样的双重折磨。于是早早就躺在了床上，吃了些药睡了下去。
只记得那天晚上有个神奇的梦，感觉手脚都被不同的人管着（黑暗大法师），然后一次次写报告要求控制手脚，跟每个人都交易了某些特定的东西，才让手脚活动起来。于是醒来，已经来到了第二天，12 点出头。我坐在床上稳定了很久，脑子里还是嗡嗡响，仿佛被庞大的信息量塞了个水泄不通⋯⋯毕竟刚才做了那么多的事才把自己的控制权要回来。一看温度计，体温正常了。
此时看着窗外的天空，敲了敲…</span>

                    <span>常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。
 
其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。


Part 1|咨询前
 确认专业资质和能力 

1. 教育经历
 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。
比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。
而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。



国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：

精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；
临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；
学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；
私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。

在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。
2.执业资格
除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。
2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。



但即便有证书，也…</span>

                    <span>众所周知，MOBA游戏网络效应好、社区属性强，自然增长极快。然而其初期推广难、用户累积慢、运营成本高等问题又总是令让众多厂商纷纷折戟。到今天，纵观市场，似乎只有《王者荣耀》和《无尽对决》曾杀出重围，获得人气与价值的双丰收。其他产品却没有这样好的运气了，不管是网易的《决战！平安京》，还是腾讯的《Arena of Valor》，纵使承载着极高期望和投入，却都没能够翻起太大水花，最终也不过是淹没于茫茫游戏之海，被众人所遗忘。

2020年6月，腾讯和Pokemon Company共同宣布联手打造基于宝可梦IP的轻度MOBA手游《宝可梦大集结》，欲二度冲击海外市场。游戏于2021年7月登录Switch平台，同年9月登录移动端平台。令人惊讶的是，本作并没有照搬腾讯天美信手拈来的Dota式核心战斗模式，而是迎合轻度玩家喜好，从诸如《风暴英雄》和《Splatoon 2》的类MOBA游戏中汲取灵感，将游戏的重心，从杀敌推塔，转移到了收集能量、达阵得分上，让MOBA游戏走上了休闲娱乐的全新道路。腾讯希望依赖宝可梦的全球影响力来吸引到IP粉丝/泛用户，逐步扩圈，培养出更大的欧美MOBA玩家市场。那么，此番采用全新玩法与独特画风、针对不同目标用户群的《宝可梦大集结》，有没有帮助腾讯再下一城呢？

从数据来看，上线三个月的《宝可梦大集结》在海外市场的表现可谓是高开低走。在声势浩大的首周发布后，游戏逐步暴露出新用户获取乏力、现有用户流失多、长期付费不如意等问题。这究竟是什么原因呢？本期《庖丁解游》就将为大家解析一下这款游戏：《宝可梦大集结》。


（一）游戏循环：单局对战贯穿始终

《宝可梦大集结》游戏核心循环示意如图，MOBA类游戏的核心循环简单明了，主要以单局对战为基础，在对战—变强—继续对战的链条上衍生诸多其他机制。对《宝可梦大集结》来说，在对战之外，玩家还可以在对战中累计胜场、获得金币，从而…</span>

                    <span>CodeNewbie Challenge 2022 begins on January 31st. Register for Cohort 1 by January 30th.





In early 2020, DEV acquired an incredible, supportive community for early-career software developers and people learning to code called CodeNewbie. 
Since then, we&#x27;ve embarked on many exciting adventures together including two entirely virtual CodeLand conferences and the creation of CodeNewbie Community: the official home of CodeNewbie built on Forem.
In 2021, we relaunched the CodeNewbie Challenge together. This collection of email-based challenges including (&quot;Start Coding&quot;, &quot;Code More&quot;, &quot;Write More&quot;, and &quot;Get a Job&quot;) existed long before DEV and CodeNewbie joined forces, but together, we updated it and added in additional support options and a central hub on CodeNewbie Community. Those who participated benefitted from structure, public accountability, inspiration, and ample learning opportunities to reach their goals.
CodeNewbie Challenge for 2022 (#CNC2022).



#CNC2022 returns on January 31st. This time, we&#x27;re making a few changes, including:
A pre-registration, cohort-based model that allows you to stay in tighter communication with others participating in your chosen challenge
Updated resources
A brand new &quot;Learn in Public&quot; challenge that will give you the guidance you need to turn your technical learning journey into a tool for others
If you want to make a change in your career or coding journey, we highly encourage you to sign up for Cohort 1 of #CNC2022. 
Learn more, pick your challenge, and sign up for Cohort 1 here by January 30th. The challenge officially kicks off on January 31st, 2022. 
Cheers to starting to code, coding more, writing more, getting a job, and learning in public with the CodeNewbie Challenge in 2022 ⭐️</span>

                    <span>Profiling is integral to any code and performance optimization. Any experience and skill in performance optimization that you might already have will not be very useful if you don&#x27;t know where to apply it. Therefore, finding bottlenecks in your applications can help you solve performance issues quickly with very little overall effort.
In this article we will look at the tools and techniques that can help us narrow down our focus and find bottlenecks both for CPU and memory consumption, as well as how to implement easy (almost zero-effort) solutions to performance issues in cases where even well targeted code changes won&#x27;t help anymore.

                    <span>If you want to get started in DevOps, Jenkins is most important and handy software you should learn.In this article, I will run you through how to install Jenkins and create first  Pipeline
Jenkins can be installed in numerous ways, I will be using  docker to run the jenkins locally.
To run the below command you need docker.
docker run --name jenkin-master


This command downloads the jenkins:jdk11 image and runs it, -v create a volume to maintain data persistence, runs the Jenkins in port 8080 with name jenkin-master
Go to http://localhost:8080 to access the Jenkins. You will see below screen

To access the path given in the Jenkins page, we need to log into the docker image with below command
docker exec -it jenkin-master /bin/bash
-it stands for interactive terminal

                    <span>Since I started learning frontend development more than a year ago, I often read the term &quot;agile methods&quot;. This caught my attention, and soon I started reading the Scrum Guide. 
I was interested in this kind of working methods since I heard during my studies (I studied Japanese Studies at University of Vienna) that the Japanese started to develop and use Kanban board, a scheduling system, in the late 1940s to improve their productivity at Toyota.

I liked the idea behind it and soon realized that this is something that companies in Europe (and I guess all over the world) are working with nowadays as well.
When job searching, I kept reading the job title &#x27;Scrum Master&#x27;, so it must be a job itself, I thought. And not because I want to become a Scrum Master myself, but to understand how Scrum…</span>

                    <span>1. Explicitly


Using the square bracket notation. This is probably the most common way of creating an Array.
const arr &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];

Using the ES6 notation you can create a copy of another array. Specially useful in functional programming to avoid side effects (i.e. modifying the original array).
const numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];

const copyOfNumbers &#x3D; [...numbers];

// You can also join 2 arrays into one:
const numbersTwice &#x3D; [...numbers, ...numbers];
// This will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

JavaScript defines an Array constructor that allows you to specify the length of the array. This method is useful if you know how large your array is going to be. Note that the constructor will create an array where all the elements are empty (not undefined).
const emptyArray &#x3D; new Array(5);

console.log(emptyArray);
// [  ]

console.log(emptyArray.length);
// 5

This method accepts an iterator (which can be another array or a set) and creates a new array with the same elements.
const copiedArray &#x3D; Array.from([1, 2, 3]);

This method accepts an unlimited number of parameters that will be used as elements of the new constructed array.
const paramsArray &#x3D; Array.of(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;);</span>

Let us learn the differences between a traditional function and an arrow function expression in JavaScript? If not, then prepare to learn the differences in this article. We will discuss the differences between both and share the pros and cons to help us better understand when is the right time to use one over the other. 

Introduction
Function Expression
Arrow Function Expression
Conclusion
In JavaScript, there are a few ways we can declare a function. One widespread and traditional way is function expressions. We can name our expression whatever we want to, but it&#x27;s recommended to name functions precisely what it is intended to do for best practice. To help prevent confusion later on. 
So how exactly do we accomplish this? Well, let us look at how a function expression is …</span>

The world can be a scary place and more and more companies are beginning to turn to Chaos Engineering to proactively poke and prod their systems and in doing so are improving their reliability and guarding against unexpected failures in production and unplanned downtime. 
During my career I dealt with my fair share of outages, including one that caught me mid-song during a bout of karaoke and far too many that woke me up at 02:00. As the co-founder and CTO at Gremlin, I do my best to make sure no other engineers have to suffer sleepless nights worrying about their product. 
But the question remains, what is Chaos Engineering and where did it come from?

                    <span>Execution Context-




Execution context is the environment that enables JavaScript code to execute. It decides which piece of code currently gets access to all the functions, variables and objects used in the code for its execution.
In this the code gets evaluated line by line, variables &amp; objects etc get stored in the Memory heap that are then used during the execution of that piece of code thus forming an environment that enables execution of the JS code.
Call Stack is a data-structure that maintains the list of the functions being called and executed/ the execution context currently being executed by the JavaScript engine.
It follows a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, meaning that the last function called gets to the top of the call stack and once execution is finished, it pops fro…</span>

                    <span>Linux 内核 2021 年成绩总结

Linux 内核的代码仓库已经有 106 万次提交，来自约 24.3 万个不同的作者。源代码树目前由 3,220 万行组成，涉及 74,300 个文件。但仅从单纯的数据上来说，要比往年低一些。在 2021 年只有 7.37 万次提交；而 2020 年提交量为 9.02 万次，上一次低于 7.3 万次提交还要追溯到 2013 年，当时提交量为 7.09 万。2021 年内核增加了 320 万行，删除了 130 万行，也低于 2020 年的 400 万行和 150 万行。不过，从内核贡献者的邮件地址数量来看，2021 年，有 4421 个电子邮件，2020 年有 4603 个，2019 年有 4383 个，都大致相当。


老王点评：之所以数量降低，更多的原因应该是 2021 年只完成了 5 个主要版本，而其它年份往往有 6 个主要版本。主要版本发布会带来大量的代码行数和提交数量变化。




KDE 发布 2022 年路线图

KDE 2021 年的路线图已经顺利完成，现在发布了新的 2022 年路线图：


Wayland 会话争取可以完全取代 X11 会话。

对 Breeze 图标集进行大修。

完善多显示器支持。

15 分钟错误计划修复更多错误，“15 分钟错误”指用户在使用桌面的 15 分钟内容易遇到的小问题。

系统设置区域中的语言和格式页面合二为一。


……等等。


老王点评：相比其它更大更闪亮的变化，我更重视这个 15 分钟错误计划。




Mozilla 创始人臭骂 Mozilla 基金会接受加密货币支付

Jamie Zawinski 是最初的 Netscape 开发者之一，因此也被视作 Mozilla 项目的创始人之一。在 Firefox 的开发者宣布他们接受狗狗币、比特币和以太坊等加密货币支付后，对 Mozilla 大骂：“（消音……）每个参与项目的人都应该为这个决定感到羞愧，因为他们与地球上的庞氏骗徒合作。”


老王点评：非常有个性的一位编程高手，但是我觉得对加密货币这个事情，现在下论断还太早。顺便说一句，昨天，1 月 3 日是比特币创始区块的挖出日期。</span>

                    <span>当你点击 Ubuntu 网站 上的下载按钮时，它会给你几个选项。其中两个分别是 Ubuntu 桌面版和 Ubuntu 服务器版。

这可能会让新用户感到困惑。为什么会有两个（实际上是四个）？应该下载哪一个？Ubuntu 桌面版还是服务器版？它们是一样的吗？有什么区别？



我将解释 Ubuntu 的桌面版和服务器版的区别。我还会解释你应该使用哪个变体。

Ubuntu 桌面版与 Ubuntu 服务器版



要了解 Ubuntu 桌面版和服务器版的区别，你应该了解桌面操作系统和服务器操作系统的区别。

桌面操作系统

桌面电脑Desktop是指个人电脑（PC）。桌面电脑操作系统带有一个图形用户界面，以便用户可以使用鼠标和键盘操作。桌面电脑的主要目的是给你一个系统，可以用来浏览网页、编辑文档、查看/编辑图片和视频、编码和游戏。基本上，就是为个人、终端用户或家庭成员提供了一个通用的计算机。

我在这里使用桌面电脑这个术语，但这并不意味着它不能用于笔记本电脑。桌面电脑是个人电脑的通用术语。

服务器操作系统

另一方面，服务器操作系统是专门为托管网站、应用程序、媒体服务器、数据库等网络服务而打造的。

通常情况下，服务器操作系统不带有图形界面。如果是基于 Linux 的操作系统，你就得通过终端的命令来使用该系统。

这里的好处是，服务器操作系统不需要（浪费）大量的内存和计算能力，因为它们不使用 图形化桌面环境。除此以外，服务器操作系统的软件包配置也不同。

现在你对服务器和桌面的区别有了一些了解，让我们看看 Ubuntu 服务器版和桌面版的区别。

用户界面

Ubuntu 服务器版和桌面版之间最明显的区别是用户界面。

Ubuntu 桌面版的特点是采用 GNOME 桌面环境的图形化用户界面。这使得它在鼠标点击的帮助下更容易使用。

                    <span>Samba 是一种灵活的文件共享工具，它将你可能在组织中运行的所有不同平台结合在一起。




在我接触 Linux 的早期，我是纽约州一个小型学前教育学区的技术总监。我们的技术预算总是捉襟见肘。我们是一个 Windows 2000 活动目录域，但我们的中央服务器磁盘空间有限，而且没有教师的主目录。此外，我们经历过十几次员工电脑硬盘故障。

我正在寻找一种方法，以最小的成本保存员工的工作。这时我发现了 Samba。在那之前，我一直将 Linux 用于内容过滤，不知道我们的 Windows 工作站可以连接到服务器并保存文件备份。

Samba 项目 自 1992 年以来一直存在。当我开始试验这个项目的时候，这个项目已经有 10 年历史了，我对如何配置它一无所知。我买了一本书并阅读了如何实现它，然后我从我们的电脑柜中取出一台旧电脑，购买了一个 300G 的希捷 IDE 驱动器，安装了 Linux，并配置了 Samba。我使用了一个简单的配置，并且它成功了。在向我们的一个 IT 助理展示后，我们部署了这个解决方案。硬盘故障的问题继续存在，但我们的员工不再需要担心失去他们所有的辛苦工作。

Samba 采用 GPL 许可证，并在大多数 Linux 发行版上广泛使用。Samba 有很好的 文档，Fedora 用户可以查阅这份在 Fedora 上配置 Samba 的文档。

在 Linux 上安装 Samba

你可以使用你的发行版的包管理器来安装 Samba。

在 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL、Mageia 和类似的系统上：

$ sudo dnf install samba


在 Debian, Linux Mint 和类似系统上：

$ sudo apt install samba


用 Samba 创建一个共享文件夹

                    <span>编注：本文包含对性内容的描述。本文探讨的议题非常沉重且现实，在留言讨论前，请慎重考量自己的言辞。

色情数字内容在中国违法，但在不少国家是合法的。
以日本色情影像界为例，在拍摄前，男女演员就知道色情内容将用于贩卖，法律、经纪人公司和工会会保障演员权益。行业规范要求演员定期进行体检，确保健康。演员充分了解拍摄作品会在贩卖店上架，也会上传到流媒体平台供付费用户观看。
可是，对大多数人来说，私密时刻是只属于两个人的愉悦，偷拍是不可容忍的恶行，更不用说传播到互联网。这也是为何，酒店中时不时曝出的针孔摄像机丑闻不断挑动人们的神经。偷拍行为，或者未经当事人同意并传播性内容，违反大部分国家的法律，与色情业是否合法并无关联。
在关于此类议题的一众声音中，我始终坚持这样一个观点：问题不在色情，而在知情，或者说同意。韦恩斯坦和爱泼斯坦激发的「#MeToo」运动，重中之重就在于未曾得到同意。当我们讨论酒店摄像头，那些愤怒与恐惧正是来自对隐私的侵犯与剥夺，它让当事人心中原本的温存与快乐变成了步步紧逼的噩梦，甚至会伴随终生。
她们对此有两层不知情。第一，不知道发生关系时拍下照片或视频。第二，即使知道被拍下照片或视频，也不知道会传播出去。
这些性内容传播的重灾区就在臭名昭著的草榴社区和 91porn。

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人：
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

介绍一下你自己
Hello 大家好，我是 B 站科技区的大狸子切切里，大家也可以叫我切里~
我平时会做一些数码产品还有游戏主机的视频，手机也做得比较多。不过我自己平时做视频的选题也比较随意啦，比如改造智能家居，分享一些游戏，甚至分享一些莫名其妙的小玩意儿。
我做视频一般会喜欢从贴近生活的体验小细节出发吧，分享一些有趣的功能，一些我自己的理解和看法。可能不是很专业，但是我会用比较有趣的方式分享给大家。
推荐一本书 / 游戏
推荐一本书的话，我当然是推荐《三体》啦！太佩服大刘的想象力了！
图 / 豆瓣
最近最喜欢的其实是游戏《死亡搁浅》以及游戏内收录的歌曲，但它不是一部电影啦。是一部非常有特色的电影化叙事的游戏。我觉得游戏和电影是两种截然不同的艺术形式，《死亡搁浅》是真的能让我感受到为什么说游戏是第九艺术。

在订阅哪些服务 / 应用
在订阅的应用和服务有 Apple Music 和 iCloud。（Apple Music 的音质真的太棒了！iCloud 就更不用说了，作为一名视频制作者，手机里的素材简直不要太多🤣。）
分享一件今年让你印象最深刻的事 / 对你意义最重大的事
这一年对我来说意义最重大还是五月份的时候，托王也老师的福，在上海北京走动了一圈，和各位前辈大佬们见面取经！和 LKS、小鹿米老师、Tim 还有小鱼都合影成功😬
今年对我来说印象最深刻的就是 8 月份的时候，播放突破百万的两个视频。可以说那是我做视频的两年以来，最开心的一段时间了。一方面视频得到了大家的认可，一方面也是自己终于做出了点小成就，内心得到了满足，自信心也大大地提升了。在自己漫长的成长路上，有了方向有了动力，也更有想法去创造更好的未来。
突破百万播放的 2 个视频
过去一年你的城市中有什么经常去的地方 / 想再去一次的地方？
深圳内最经常去的地方好像是……机场？😅
想要再去一次的地方大概是东部华侨城吧~大学兼职的时候拿着工资去过一次，园区内真的好适合拍照嘻嘻。因为疫情的原因不能再出国旅游啦，于是第一次出国旅游去的日本，也成了我想要在夏天再去一次的地方。
推荐一个年度产品（好物）
PS5！索尼太牛了！最顶级的游戏体验还是得在 PS5。
 
用一个词概括你的 2021，应该是什么？为什么？
幸运。
其实我做视频的第一年一直都平平淡淡没有什么起色，今年一年内涨粉到 50w。我觉得并不是我今年比去年更努力，而是我坚持走下来了。很幸运跌跌撞撞后走上了一条相对正确的方向。
如果你觉得你走的路是对的，请相信自己，勇敢的走下去。
你心目中的年度照片

有什么今年新学会的技能 / 思维 / 方法论？
我之前视频里也有跟小伙伴们说过，克服完美注意拖延症。
拖延症大家多多少少都有点，其实我觉得人之常情。但是还有一种更可怕的，完美主义拖延症。我之前做事情就喜欢把事情计划到 100% 再来行动，我要把所有事情想的尽可能周全，比如做视频我要先列大纲再列时间表，再写好详细计划。这种做事方式就让很多事情最后因为要求太高而不了了之。
后来我发现行动力比计划重要。我需要先动手做，才能发现我会遇到的问题，再从已经做了的部分向前推进。道理看上去简简单单，但是真的贯穿我做频道的每一个阶段，有很多项目迟迟没有进展，最后发现其实还是只停在计划阶段，甚至还没有做第一步的落地。我就会提醒自己，诶？这不是老毛病了？
展望 2022
我能看到我和大佬们还有很大的差距，有时候看一些视频真是热血沸腾。我觉得我的视频里还少了一点这样的震撼吧～
2022 年也是我的本命年，希望能做出更加有深度更加有趣的内容，也希望自己能够多走出家门，拍些不一样的题材，也能多多运动！身体是革命的本钱，大家也一定要保重身体！
希望 2022 年结束，频道能做到 100 万粉丝吧！加油！！！冲鸭！！！

2021 年 12 月 9 日，备受时尚界关注的潘通（PANTONE）公司终于 公布 了 2022 年度代表色——长春花蓝（PANTONE 17-3938 Very Peri），一种红得发紫的蓝。

PANTONE 17-3938 长春花蓝含括蓝色的特质，同时又保有紫红的基调，展现一种机灵、愉悦的态度与充满活力的风貌，激发勇气十足的创意与想象丰富的表现。
——彩通色彩研究所副总裁 Laurie Pressman

对于很多人来讲，尤其是和色彩相关的同学来讲，每年看潘通的年度代表色发布已经成为了一种习惯。而实际上来讲，这也确实已经成为了一种习惯。从 1999 年开始，每年的 12 月份，潘通都会公布下一年的年度代表色，至今已经有 23 年了。也就是讲，从 2000 年开始至即将到来的 2022 年，每年都有一款年度代表色。
今天的这篇文章，我们聊一聊颜色与年度代表色以及它们背后的故事。
关于潘通的一些小知识
在开始正文之前，我们先了解一些关于潘通的小知识。「潘通」二字并不是 Pantone 的正式官方名称。它只是公众根据英文「PANTONE」而来的一个通俗的音译译名，而实际上「潘通」公司官方正式的名称为「彩通」。在实际的传播中，「潘通」的影响力早已超越了「彩通」，甚至于出现只知「潘通」不知「彩通」的情况。为了叙事方便，下文中如果没有特别指出，「潘通」等同于「彩通」。
潘通（Pantone LLC）是一家总部位于美国新泽西州卡尔士达特市（Carlstadt）的有限责任公司，目前它是 爱色丽 的全资子公司。潘通以其彩通配色系统（PANT…</span>

iOS 14 爆出 HomeKit 严重漏洞
国外一名研究人员于去年 8 月向 Apple 提交了一个存在 iOS 系统中的漏洞，当 Homekit 设备名称采用了非常长的字符串时，加载该设备的 iOS 或者 iPadOS 就会重新启动并导致无法正常使用。由于Homekit 设备名称会被存储到 iCloud 并同步，从而会导致漏洞反复出现。据悉该漏洞可影响 iOS 14 设备。虽然在 iOS 15 后限制了 HomeKit 的设备名称长度，但如果通过 iCloud 同步此前的 HomeKit 数据则依旧会受到影响，…</span>

                    <span>一转眼2021年又很快地过去了，在汽车行业内卷越来越厉害的今天，大家基本上都卷出了风格、卷出了水平。
但也有部分车企比较叛逆，要么是另辟蹊径，要么是划水躺平，反正就是读不懂用户的心。
所以，接下三斤哥就为大家总结下我眼中2021年上市车型中最好和最差的几款，暨第二届“金轱辘奖”年度车型评选颁奖典礼。
写在最前（评选原则）

本次评选纯主观，如有不同意见纯属正常；
所有候选车型均为2021年新上市正式交付用户的车型；
上述新上市不含年度改款或变化幅度较小的中期改款；
候选车型尽可能从较为常见的品牌中选取；
……

第二届“金轱辘奖”最佳车型
纯电组——极氪001

获奖理由：如果你想买一台BBA，那你真的可以来看一看极氪001
其实极氪001自从上市以来就收获了很多关注，并且随着时间的推移，还得到了各种各样的吐槽，一度有不少人觉得极氪001是个非常大的坑。
但是让我们回归理性，极氪001这台车是不是真的像网友说得那么神 or 那么坑？
那么在我看来，如果只进行简单的选配的话，WE版的性价比其实还是非常非常高的。
即使是现在订车，WE版乞丐版扣除补贴后的售价应该是在28万左右，那么28万你可以得到什么？

一个我个人认为还不错的外观、无框车门、电动尾门；
媲美C级车的内部空间、可调节的后排座椅；
Model 3P级别的加速 or 蔚来标价12.8万的100度电池；
越级的内饰用料；
比传统豪华品牌更智能的车机和辅助驾驶系统；
……

以上这一切的落地价都没有超过30万，而30万落地的BBA又有什么呢？
插电混动组——比亚迪 秦DM-i

获奖理由：秦plus DM-i的上市让一切关于混动车是否更划算的争吵失去了意义
如果有人穿越到2021年初告诉你，今年有一款均价10万+的自主品牌A级轿车可以连续几个月进入轿车销量榜前十，你会相信吗？
可能大多数人都不会相信，但是秦plus做到…</span>

                    <span>(未来的) 梦幻团队

凭借 ZZT 的成功，Epic MegaGames 正式成立。在命名新公司时，Tim 认为玩家的第一印象很重要，公司名字听起来像是“大”公司，这样才产生信任，而且要够酷够“狠” (badass)，最后把 Epic (史诗) 和 Mega (大) 组合起来，就有了 Epic MegaGames 的名字。
尽管 ZZT 销售情况很不错，但 Epic MegaGames 还只是 Tim 一个人的公司。Tim 需要开始下一款产品的开发和销售，产生收入。他看到 id Software 的指挥官基恩 (Commander Keen) 后大受启发。指挥官基恩是 John Carmack 受任天堂超级马里奥启发后开发，在 1990 年推出的一款 2D 横版卷轴过关游戏。指挥官基恩流畅的动作和画面给 Tim 带来了深刻印象，认为他下一款游戏需要突破 ZZT 这样的简单风格。Tim 找来了两位美术和一位作曲，开发了一款游戏机制和指挥官基恩相似的游戏 Jill of the Jungle，由玩家操纵女性角色 Jill 在森林中冒险闯关。Jill of the Jungle 的销量对比 ZZT 也上了一个新台阶，在发售初期每天能卖出 20 到 30 份。
  
Jill of the Jungle 游戏画面

除了自己继续进行游戏开发以外，Tim 也在考虑扩张团队。Mark Rein 会逢其适地出现了。Mark Rein 是一位狂热玩家，在 1990 年体验过指挥官基恩之后，他联系上了 id Software 创始人之一 John Romero 表达了自己对这个系列的喜爱。John Romero 也因此邀请他测试还在开发中的指挥官基恩 4。经过近距离交流，John Romero 认为 Mark Rein 具备 id 所代表的“黑客精神” (hacker mentality)…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
笔者实在没有半夜赶稿子的能耐，毕竟是一条社畜。一早起来就看到 @呆呆兽星君 的文章，细读之后，叹为观止。既然珠玉在前，笔者也就谈一下本次更新中另一位出手的女性——陆玲珑，以及她所依凭的全真功法，是如何给她自信上岛一闯的？

玲珑师承：大道至简  独全其真
陆玲珑所修习的是被金庸誉为”玄门正宗“的全真派功夫。

全真派源流
全真一脉是道家现存最大的两大流派之一（另一个就是正一派），由金代王重阳(公元1112年—1170年)创立，主张儒、佛、道三教合一，即以“三教圆融、识心见性、独全其真”为宗旨，相比正一派的祖师张道陵（公元34年－156年）晚了千年的时光。但是其开创的全真道流派却能够在千年之后与正一道分庭抗礼，其主旨所推推崇“以无为为主”，即注重个人修炼，相比入世甚深的正一派，则是回归老庄清静无为的思想。

白云观——全真三大祖庭之一
虽然相比正一派的入世风格，全真派恪守戒律，对于世事不会多做介入，但全真派始终坚持“贵生”的理念。陆玲珑师承全真龙门派，其拜师的北京白云观正是全真教三大祖庭之一。当年丘处机赴雪山应成吉思汗聘，成吉思汗问他如何治理天下，他回答应以“敬天爱民”为本；问长生久视之道，回答以清心寡欲为要。后回京居太极宫，元太祖因其道号长春子，诏改太极宫为长春宫。及丘处机羽化，弟子尹志平等在长春宫东侧营建下院，即今白云观，并于观中构筑处顺堂，安厝丘处遗蜕。

成吉思皇帝敕真人丘师：省所奏应诏而来者，备悉。惟师：道踰三子，德重多端。命臣奉厥元纁，驰传访诸沧海。时与愿适，天不人远。两朝屡诏而不行，单使一邀而肯起。谓朕天启，所以身归。不辞暴露于风霜，自愿跋涉于沙碛。书章来上，喜慰何言？军国之事，非朕所期；道德之心，诚云可尚。朕以彼酋不逊，我伐用张。军旅临试，边陲底定。来从去背，实力率之故然；久逸暂劳，冀心服而后已。是用载扬威德，略驻车徒。重念云轩既发于蓬莱，鹤驭可游于…</span>

                    <span>Today was my first day on the new project team. Although today&#x27;s focus was on the setup, I already learned a lot of (useful) things and tools that I didn&#x27;t know before. (I guess that&#x27;s the great part of always working in other project teams).
Let me describe today in more detail 🤓
Daily Scrum Meeting
I had been assigned a mentor 🥰 with whom I set up my laptop. By the way, this is an additional laptop, there is an extra laptop for each project for security reasons. I was given all the access to the tools they use, Microsoft Teams, GitLab, etc.
Jira
Jira, an agile management tool, with Scrum board (there are also other boards like Kanban). There all current issues are entered in the Scrum Backlog, active ones were assigned to a Dev, in the Product Backlog you can find the whole list of all issues. Jira is a very clear and good tool to work effectively as a Scrum team.
As you can see, Scrum is very present, so I recommend you to get familiar with the framework before your first job. It will definitely come across well in the interview if you have already dealt with it. 
Jenkins
CMD Shortcuts
GitLens
NVM
nvm use 16.13.1.
Today was great. 🥳 I learned so many new things without writing a single line of code. I&#x27;m really looking forward to finally getting started with my issue. 

Thanks for your reading and time. I really appreciate it!</span>

                    <span>To be a great developer you don&#x27;t need just knowing how to code , and hard tech skills, but also you must have a good soft skills ,so I share with you a list of 7 soft skills that will help you in your work.
1 - Problem-solving: you need to have the ability to know  the reason that caused  the probleme , then searching on solution and  fix it .
2 -Communication: is most important skill for any developer, becuase you need  to speak  with your colleagues,  managers, customers ,  and also  in meeting , for that  you need to speak clearly with confidence ,therefor spend mush time listening to others persones  and don’t interrupt while somebody is talking,adding to this you need to be patient and focused.
3 - Time management: before start your work should to write your to- do-list and set the the priority goals and period time of any task ,moreover take a balance between a work and personal live.
4 - Creativity: to be a creative developer you need to try and discover 
5 - Patience: you need to be able to keep calm When your code isn’t working and you can’t figure it out, Or when a code review is taking a long time,  and also when you start to  learn something  new .
6 - Teamwork: as a developer, you will work with a wide variety of teams and people for that you need to have a good social skills and communication ,rather than a good speaker and listener.
7 - Help other: helping your colleagues and customers is the most thing that make you building a good reputation and relationship in your work .

                    <span>Mi intención con esto es explicar como animar el corazón sin tener que dibujarlo con CSS3, en este caso es solo importar un icono o una imagen, esto va más que todo orientado a las personas que están comenzando a probar keyframes ya posteriormente en otro post explicaré como crear el corazón con puro CSS.
Font Awesome y tomando este icono  con esto ya tendremos el HTML.

Ahora, como soy medio flojo agarre un color gradiente de una página web llamada CSS Gradient y seleccione el que más me gusto, ustedes pueden hacer lo mismo, luego al body le di estos estilos para poder centrar el elemento. 
height: 100vh;

Hasta este momento vamos de esta forma:

Siguiendo con el corazón, usaré la clase que ya trae cuando importamos el icono para así darle su estilo y luego poder animarlo.
.fa-heart {


Ya tenemos un corazón.
 
Pasemos a la etapa final que es animarlo para que parezca que está latiendo.
CSS utilizando la misma clase anterior.
.fa-heart {

Sigamos ahora con el keyframe y le diremos que cuando tenga un 25% tenga una propiedad transform y que escale 1.2 su tamaño original.
@keyframes heart {






Ya con esto parecerá que está latiendo como un corazón normal, como pueden ver es algo sencillo y para nada difícil emplear una animación bien simple.

Today we&#x27;re going to be building an accessible menu system in Nuxt using recursion! You&#x27;ll be able to use this pattern in a variety of ways: navigation drop-downs, nested sidebar navigations, and plenty of others.
We&#x27;ll be building it in the context of a sidebar navigation. Think &quot;multiple sub-level navigation menus&quot; akin to what you would expect to see in the sidebar of a documentation site.
Those can get nested and messy very quickly, but we&#x27;re going to build two components to handle the whole thing!
Note: The accessible menu portion of this article is based on this article by none other than Heydon Pickering

                    <span>What is Matrix?


In order to get an understanding of what Matrix really is, it&#x27;s the best to check it out directly from the official documentation.
However, to put it in layman&#x27;s terms, Matrix lets you choose the (public)server that you want to use it on. It even allows you to host and use it on your server! So, you won&#x27;t be locked to a specific server. And you can also communicate with your friends who are on different Matrix servers or different Matrix clients altogether. In fact, you can even communicate with friends who are using other messenger apps via Bridges.
Other messenger apps, on the other hand, won&#x27;t let you choose the server/provider you want to use their services on. For example, if you use WhatsApp, you have no option to choose the server/channel. And you can&#x27;t communicate…</span>

                    <span>Although both the Solana Tool Suite and Anchor have already got good native support for the M1 architecture, there are currently no official binary builds for the new Macs.
In this guide, we will go through all the steps needed to compile and install the tools on your machine natively, without having to set up a cumbersome Rosetta environment.
First, you will need to install the Rust toolchain.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt


This should be all what we need.
Before compiling the Solana Tool Suite, you will need coreutils installed on your computer in case you don’t have it:
brew install coreutils

Now let’s clone the Solana repository. I’m using shallow cloning to speed up things since the entire commit history is not needed.
# grab only the repo state at the v1.9.2 tag
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.9.2 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git

Then, go into the directory and run the cargo-install-all.sh script.
cd solana
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .
echo &quot;export PATH&#x3D;$PWD/bin:\$PATH&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc


This will take a while, but after it is finished, you can verify if the installation is successful with:
solana --version

There used to be an issue with solana-test-validator on M1 Macs, but the problem has been solved. You can try to spin it up to make sure it works.

Anchor is the recommended framework for Solana programs.
Note that Anchor uses Yarn v1 to manage Javascript dependencies in your project, so make sure you already have it installed on your computer.
Since there’s no official binary available for the M1 architecture, we’ll also need to build from source:
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.19.0 anchor-cli --locked

Then, you can verify if the installation is successful with:
anchor --version


And that’s it. Have fun building with Solana on your M1 Mac natively!

                    <span>Configuration is always a chore, but an unfortunately necessary evil. And configuring a package for CommonJS (CJS) and ES Modules (ESM) can be a waking nightmare—not least because it has changed a dozen times in half as many years.
As one of the implementers for Node.js Loaders, touching much of Node’s internal ESM code, I get asked quite frequently “how do I make this work!?” (often with angry tears); but yet more frequently I come across packages that are just misconfigured.
My name is Jacob, and I’m here to help.
I have confirmed all the provided package.json configurations (not specifically marked “does not work”) work in Node.js 12.22.x (v12 latest, the oldest supported line) and 17.2.0 (current latest at the time)1, and for grins, with webpack 5.53.0 and 5.63.0 respectively. I’ve pre…</span>

⚔️ Over the years, observing the world of technologies, I could not help but feel that it is a great material for creating a separate universe that could become the basis for an extremely interesting story 
🗺️ This project is purely for fun. Using real data, such as the number of NPM downloads, stars on github or website traffic, I tried to measure the &quot;power&quot; of a given technology and visualize it with quasi-historical maps.
🛡️ Anyway - if you&#x27;re curious about what front-end technologies visualized as states would look like, read on.
And if you have any idea how this story and this universe could become more interesting, or more in line with real statistics related to the front-end - let me know in the comment!

                    <span>Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It has been a de facto choice for creating a web-server application in Node.js. Read these series if you want to use Express in your application.
Let&#x27;s see how you can make Express more secure.
Old versions of Express have vulnerabilities like Path traversal (CVE-2017-14849). The best practice is to use the latest stable packages to mitigate such vulnerabilities. You can use the npm audit command to find out known vulnerabilities in your Nodejs application. Then you can fix them by running the npm audit fix command. Make sure to get 0 vulnerabilities in the report of the npm audit command.

                    <span>Nuxt 3 beta dropped few months ago and with it, several modules have been updated to work well with a new Nuxt 3 architecture. For the previous version of Nuxt (also the most stable right now), we had a repository template for building new Nuxt 2 modules with it. These modules could be then released as NPM packages and easy downloaded for the users to provide useful functionality like PWA, i18n, Google Analytics and many more that you can check here. As there is no Nuxt 3 module template repository nor an article how to create one, I thought it would be a good idea to create one. 
In this article, we will be taking a look at @nuxtjs/strapi module as it is Nuxt 3 compatible, very well developed and documented.

                    <span>String slicing lets you slice into Python strings, and work with their slices, or substrings—instead of the whole string.
As strings in Python are immutable, you cannot change them in place. In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn to slice Python strings and work with substrings.
[start:stop:step]

The above line of code:
Returns a slice of the string —starting at index start, extending up to stop-1 in steps of step.
The start index is optional: the slice starts from the beginning of the string by default.
The stop index is also optional: the slice extends up to the end of the string by default.
The step value is optional too. The default value of step is 1 and includes all characters in the string.

                    <span>So, After reading  How To Mint an NFT - A Step-by-Step Guide To Creating Your First NFT by @Favor Onuoha, I decided to Mint my  Hashnode award badges as my first NFT and I will be showing you how I did it.
I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s actually a good idea, but who cares, that&#x27;s what I feel like minting.
Minting simply means to create something new on the blockchain, so in this article, you will experience how I created my first ever NFT on the blockchain.
Let&#x27;s get started.
I will be making use of metamask and opensea
balance/authentication/authorization
In case you are hearing about MetaMask for the first time, MetaMask is basically a cryptocurrency wallet holder that allows you to interact with your Ethereum blockchain wallet account and can be used to connect to other blockchain applications.…</span>

                    <span>Sourcegraph is a search tool that enables developers to search, explore and better understand all of their public and private code. It supercharges developer productivity and automates large-scale code changes. 
In this article, I’ll explore some Sourcegraph search gems with you. 
Here are 8 Sourcegraph search features you should know about!
By default, all search queries on Sourcegraph are treated as literal patterns. If you know the exact string you’re looking for in the codebase, then all you need to do is paste it in the query box and search.
Sourcegraph interprets this search pattern literally (as the name defines it) to simplify searching for words or punctuation in your codebase.
With literal search, you can find function calls, error messages, comments, notes etc. For instance, if …</span>

                    <span>Asynchronous operations are crucial when working with web applications. We can all agree how easy async/await has made our lives while dealing with asynchronous operations. 
In this post, we are going to see how to use loops with async/await. 
Before we dive into it, here are the utility functions I used for the demo

// creates a logger function to print logs with function name
function getLogger(fnName) {
  return function logger(value, diffInMS) {
    return console.log(
      &#x60;${fnName}: Item ${value} finished waiting ${Math.round(
        diffInMS / 1000
      )} seconds later.&#x60;
    );
  };
}

// simulates an async flow, a network request for example
async function waitFor(seconds) {
  // used to create the fancy waterfall

                    <span>This is an English translation of my article in Japanese.
Previously, we compiled a Go program into a WebAssembly and then converted it into C++ files to make it run on Nintendo Switch. Now, I have succeeded in compiling a Go program into a native binary for Nintendo Switch, and also running a game there. I replaced system calls with C function calls using the -overlay option. Also, I have developed a new package Hitsumabushi to generate JSON content for this.

                    <span>人工智能重新“创造”了历史

人工智能越来越多的做到了之前 无法做到的事情。谷歌使用机器学习创建了克里姆特 1900 年的画作《哲学》，而之前它只有一幅黑白照片传世。也有人利用 AI 重建了伦勃朗著名的《守夜人》边缘的缺失板块，并在夏天将它们暂时安装在原画旁边。还有人利用 3D 打印和 AI 重建了隐藏在毕加索《盲人餐》下面的早期画作。以及，德国波恩的一个管弦乐队完整地“演奏”了贝多芬的第十首未完成的交响曲，这个版本是由一个算法编写的。


老王点评：AI 修“旧”如“新”，这真的是原来的历史么？




新的补丁集将清理 Linux 内核的“依赖地狱”

这项名为“快速内核头文件”的工作花费了一年时间整理，包含了多达 2297 个补丁，完全重塑了 Linux 内核的头文件层次结构。其目标是加快内核的构建，同时清理构建过程，以解决“依赖地狱”问题。Linux 内核中大约有 1 万个主要的头文件，在过去的 30 多年里，它们已经成长为一套复杂而痛苦的交叉依赖关系。这套庞大的补丁涉及到大部分的 Linux 内核代码库。根据测试数据，启用了“快速内核头文件”的内核要比原始的内核构建性能有可能提高 50-80%。这个庞大的补丁系列已经在 x86/x86_64、SPARC、MIPS 和 ARM64 等多种架构上进行了测试。这可能是 有史以来代码规模最大 的一个 Linux 内核功能调整。


老王点评：这是一项功在千秋的工作，确实需要清理一下瓶瓶罐罐了。




Canonical 招聘 Linux 桌面游戏产品经理

据 Steam Play 最新数据，Linux 上的游戏用户占比为 1.11%，虽然略有下降。而 Ubuntu 背后的厂商 Canonical 也将目光放在了 Linux 桌面游戏上了，现在正在 招聘 Ubuntu 的桌面游戏产品经理的新职位，希望“使 Ubuntu 成为最适合游戏的 Linux 桌面”，将围绕 Ubuntu 的桌面图形驱动选择，致力于与 GPU 供应商和其他 IHV/ISV 的合作。


老王点评：Linux 还是不甘心在桌面上退让啊，让我们看看 Linux 能不能复制在服务器等领域的成功。</span>

                    <span>2022 年已至，是时候期待一些激动人心的发行版更新了！这里我们挑选了一些值得关注的发行版选择。




是时候和 2021 年说再见了。

如果你错过了 2021 年的 Linux 大事件，现在你也可以去回顾一下。

不过，考虑到 2021 年已有许多令人印象深刻的发行版推出，2022 年，对于较新的 Linux 发行版以及现有版本的更新，人们的期待值已经直达顶峰。

与十年前相比，Linux 发行版如今更加注重用户体验。这不仅仅关乎资源占用，更关系到发行版的外观及对现代桌面硬件的兼容性。

先来简单回顾一下 —— elementary OS 6.1、Zorin OS 16、Pop!_OS 21.10 和 Linux Mint 20.3 都是于 2021 年推出的大型 Linux 发行版的更新版。这些发行版都专注于改善用户体验、改进视觉、优化生产力。

毫无疑问，你可以选择上述发行版并感受前所未有的桌面体验，也可以获取 最佳 Linux 发行版 的最新更新。

所以，到了 2022 年，你又应该期待什么？是否会有一个能让用户体验更上一层楼的发行版呢？

答案是肯定的，这里就有一些你值得关注的发行版。在此我列出了清单，重点强调 2022 年这些发行版的计划更新内容。

2022 年最值得期待的发行版

请注意：这里列出的大部分发行版的官方信息暂时缺失，不过本文章将定期更新以补充最新消息。

1、Slackware 15



Slackware 是至今为止 最长寿的活跃发行版。Slackware 15 Beta 版已在去年发布，稳定版将于 2022 年初发布。

对于新手级桌面用户来说，这并不那么吸引人，不过如果你想要一款支持旧硬件，或者能够有效利用资源的发行版，Slackware 可以成为你的候选方案。

再次强调一下，Slackware…</span>

iPad mini 6：一台怎么拿都舒服的 iPad，也许是今年最「香」的新品

全面屏是今年 iPad mini 的一项重要升级，这不仅意味着 iPad 产品设计风格的进一步统一，也让这款产品在继续维持小尺寸设计的基础上，拿得更舒服、变得更好「看」了。
得益于全面屏设计，新款 iPad mini 在屏幕变大之后，设备尺寸反而变得更小：第六代 iPad mini 的高度和宽度分别为 195.4 毫米和 134.8 毫米，第五代 iPad mini 则为 203.2 毫米和 134.8 毫米；为了让它能够「装」上第二代 Apple Pencil，厚度又略有增加。对了，300 克不到 (297 克) 的重量，相比前代产品也降低了 10 克左右。
因此，iPad mini 依然会是一台怎么拿都舒服的 iPad。拿着 iPad Pro，你可能会担心它「砸」在脸上；拿着 iPhone，你可能会觉得屏幕太小。这个时候，这台 iPad mini 就显得恰到好处。

However, there’s a notable feature that still isn’t supported on any of the AirPods models — lossless

                    <span>While a lot of programming languages that have a &quot;nullish&quot; type (null, nil, etc.) debate about avoiding it, JavaScript is the only popular one that has two, you read that right, two nullish types. One of the most common recommendations is to stick to using only one, and my recommendation is to only use undefined and avoid null. In this article, we will go over the reasons you might also want to avoid null in JavaScript and TypeScript.
As Douglas Crockford put it in one of his talks, JavaScript itself uses undefined all the time, so let&#x27;s use the one the language uses:
let something; // This is undefined!

const otherThing &#x3D; {
    foo: &quot;hi&quot;,
};
otherThing.bar; // This is also undefined

const aFunction &#x3D; anArgument &#x3D;&gt; {

En este artículo exploraremos a fondo las características de los JSON Web Tokens, su composición y su implementación utilizando Minimal APIs y ASP.NET Identity.
El código de ejemplo lo podrás encontrar en este repositorio en mi github. Espero les sea de utilidad.
Un JSON Web Token (JWT) es un estándar (RFC 7519) que define una forma segura y compacta de transmitir información entre dos entidades en forma de un objeto JSON.
Esta información puede ser verificada y es confiable ya que está firmada digitalmente. Los JWTs pueden ser firmados utilizando una llave privada (con un algoritmo HMAC) o con llaves públicas y privadas utilizando RSA o ECDSA.
Aquí veremos un par de escenarios donde es útil y recomendable utilizar los JWTs:

                    <span>If you develop with IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, GoLand, or other JetBrains IDEs,  it’s likely you’ve waited for “indexing” to complete after opening a project. While this may be annoying, it’s necessary for IntelliJ and other heavy-weight IDEs to have features such as code search, highlighting, refactoring, and code completion.
Waiting for an IDE to finish indexing a project might not be a big problem for many workflows. After the first load, indexes are cached and subsequent runs are faster. However, indexing time can be a huge blocker for developers, especially in these cases:
large projects (monorepos, many dependencies, monolithic applications)


running old/slow machines (indexing is CPU-intensive)


ephemeral developer workspaces (containers, remote IDEs)

                    <span>OVERVIEW


Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open-source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. It’s usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. Some well-known open-source projects include Django, Postgres, MongoDB, Vue, Go, Ruby, TypeScript, Git and so many more.
There is a variety of good reasons to release something under an open-source license, from “more perspectives make better software” to “establishing a standard.” It is important to build a sustainable project to consider your reasons for publish…</span>

                    <span>At Blankly, we pride ourselves not just for the product that we are building, but also towards cultivating a community of quant enthusiasts which no one else is doing in this field right now. We identified a critical void that many Discord servers currently suffer from: low member engagement. That said, to elevate the overall experience of using the Blankly package and fix the problem identified earlier, we decided to roll out three Discord bots each of which specializes in something unique. We will dive into the Blankly Connect Bot in this article.
To give the users a taste of our product, we created this bot using a virtual sandbox and our in-house Blankly Connect API—the single source to connect, unify, and trade across all exchanges—which aims at simulating what the actual product will…</span>

                    <span>I’ve been working on eaf-linter for about a few days now, and it already has 6 stars and 2 forks. My other project that I&#x27;ve been working on, the Backend Server, has 14 stars, 9 forks, and nearly 10 outside contributors. That might not sound like a lot, but both of these projects are only about a week old.
So, how did I do it?
The most important thing has been issues, which I talked about here. But, the second most important thing has been designing a great readme. 
A good readme is the difference between someone staring your project and someone ignoring it. If you have badges, easily understandable features, and lots of images, you have a star worthy repository. 
First, you need to have badges. If you don&#x27;t know what a badge is, it&#x27;s the little image that says how many stars, downloads, etc. a project has. These are also known as shields, and you can get them from this website. If you have a ton of them and they all say good things, it increases the confidence that someone has in your project. 
Secondly, you need easily understandable features. If you look at my newest repository, eaf-linter, you will see that all of the features have a simple headline and they link to a new page. This is very important. If your feature can link to a more in depth description of the feature, it will increase the confidence that the possible contributor has in your project. 
Finally, images are super important. In my backend server, I have a ton of really eye-catching images. These images increase the likelihood that someone will keep looking through your readme, and the longer that the person stays on your page, the more likely they are to star your repository. 
There will be more tips like this coming tomorrow and the day after, so if you liked hearing this, make sure to follow me, so you can see more tips as they come out.

                    <span>Have you ever wondered how can you utilize your Java skills in the serverless world?
JBang.
JBang
Properly configured AWS CLI with Access and Secret key
Terraform - latest/newest release would work.
I would not like to go through how these tools should be installed, I assume these things are a piece of cake.
❯ jbang version
0.86.0
❯ aws --version
aws-cli/1.22.5 Python/3.9.5 Linux/5.15.8-76051508-generic botocore/1.23.5
❯ terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.0
on linux_amd64

JBang is a powerful tool which lets you create .java files with your requested dependencies, and with different commands you will be able to build and export .jar files and native binaries.
Okay okay, we have Maven and Gradle, why would I need this?

                    <span>AWS s3 SDK and NodeJS read/write streams makes it easy to download files from an AWS bucket. However, what if you wanted to stream the files instead? 
There is a timeout on connections to an AWS s3 instance set to 120000ms (2 minutes). Unless you have very small files, this just won&#x27;t cut it for streaming. 
One option is to simply raise that timeout, but then how much should you raise it? Since the timeout is for the total time a connection can last; you would have to either make the timeout some ridiculous amount, or guess how long it will take to stream the file and update the timeout accordingly. This is also not taking into account the stream closing due to HTTP(S)&#x27;s own timeout reasons as well.
Instead of making guesses and fighting random bugs, we can make use of the NodeJS Stream AP…</span>

                    <span>Previously, I talked about how to create easily an Entity (ex:JOB) using a simple command line make:Entity and answering a few question(fields,type…).
This article will be about saving data to, fetching data from, the database.
To do so, we need to use a service provided by Doctrine, called EntityManagerInterface. The command  symfony console  debug:autowiring doctrine shows all doctrine services available.
Type-hint an argument $em to EntityManagerInterface, create an Object (ex $job), set all its properties then call persist and flush methods.

Calling persist() method tells Doctrine that we want to save the object, no query is executed yet. We call this method as many time as objects that we have, once we call flush() method, Doctrine execute the queries needed to insert to database.
We can check if data has been inserted with : symfony console doctrine:query:sql &#x27;select * from job&#x27;

Getting data(objects) from db is even easier, one way to do that is by using JobRepository $jobRepo as an argument in our method. 

The repository class offers many helper methods to get our data from db like : findBy, findOneBy... We can also add custom methods to have complex queries, more about that in my next article. 
Finally, I like to mention that Profiler provides a lot of tools to use when developing an app, for doctrine, it shows all queries executed :

Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my article on my passion project for the last year (and several years prior in different forms/codebases).
I&#x27;ve recently completed 52 weekly streams in 2021 as I worked on coding my app, from Hello World to what it is today.




Today (Jan 2nd) was the day of my first stream one year ago so I felt it was a good day to do this release. I will be having a LIVE 🔴 Release Party Stream later TONIGHT, (Jan 2nd, 2022) at 9 PM PT to celebrate finally getting the code live and also to answer any questions or comments anyone may have.




I&#x27;m also going to be answering questions throughout the 1st week of 2022 as I will post on several sub reddits that may find this project interesting. Today I have posted on /r/reactjs so fe…</span>

                    <span>É possível utilizar desestruturação para variáveis ao invés de sempre criar novas.
Por exemplo, caso tenhamos um objeto como o a seguir:
const user &#x3D; { name: &quot;Eduardo&quot;, age: 39 };

Podemos fazer a desestruturação com a seguinte sintaxe:
const { name, age } &#x3D; user;

console.log(name); // Eduardo

console.log(age); // 39

Porém se as variáveis name e age já tiverem sido declaradas no mesmo escopo, será necessário desestruturar e renomear ao mesmo tempo:
const { name: newName, age: newAge } &#x3D; user;

console.log(newName); // Eduardo

console.log(newAge); // 39

Para atribuir a desestruturação para as variáveis declaradas anteriormente, utiliza-se a seguinte sintaxe (parênteses na declaração):
let name &#x3D; &quot;Fulano&quot;,
  age &#x3D; 22;

({ name, age } &#x3D; user);

console.log(name); // Eduardo

console.log(age); // 39</span>

My partner and I have been talking about doing an ambitious project for 2022. We&#x27;ve decided to build 12 products in 12 months.
There are a lot of reasons I&#x27;m excited about this project. The first one was mentioned above.
I&#x27;m a builder. Creating things excites me. It makes me feel alive. I love everything from naming products, designing logos, writing bits of code, and setting up deployments. Every bit of the process is a fun way to flex my creativity. It brings me joy.

I would admit that, at start, I was quite happy that I could mentor 3 interns at the same time. It was my first official experience practicing mentorship at work, so I was very happy that my capability was recognised by my superior. However, I found that I was too naive. More mentees means greater responsibilities and I would need to spare more time from my work to provide mentorship.

Recently I felt like I wanted to branch out and learn something new. I&#x27;ve always been interested in the practical and creative side of programming, so being able to deploy a project that is public facing was an exciting departure from the myriad of bespoke and educational Python scripts I&#x27;ve written.
Django was exciting to me for a few reasons: 
Popular and Scalable (Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox)
Excellent Documentation
Embraces Test Based Development 
I started my journey by cozying up with the official Django tutorial which teaches you how to write a simple poll app. This was a good intro, and opened my eyes to the simplicity and beauty of writing unit tests in Django. However, I wanted something a bit friendlier – something in-between a drawn out 4 hour monetised Youtube video,…</span>

                    <span>Many students ask me about web development project ideas for their college or resume. Even most of my friends are confused what projects they should make. 
Well after reading this article I hope you will have no doubt about it. And after adding these projects in your resume, you will get job offers like me. 
Students think that they should make something extraordinary. That they loose their time about thinking their extraordinary project. But this is wrong. 
You should make a common project but add something unique feature in it that other students don&#x27;t do. I will share the features with you. 
E-commerce website is a common project. You can make a e-commerce website and add some extra feature that others don&#x27;t. 
You can add premium membership feature in the e-commerce website. Like if the…</span>

When run-time binding of the implementation is required.
To support a proliferation of classes resulting from a coupled interface and numerous implementations,
To share an implementation among multiple objects and to map orthogonal class hierarchies.
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

The Bridge pattern is an application of the old advice, &quot;prefer composition over inheritance&quot;. It becomes handy when you must subclass different times in ways that are orthogonal with one another. Say you must implement a hierarchy of colored shapes. You wouldn&#x27;t want to subclass Shape with Rectangle and Circle and then subclass Rectangle with RedRectangle, BlueRectangl…</span>

                    <span>Forms! Forms! Forms!
Forms are an integral part of any web application. We can&#x27;t imagine an application without forms. Generally, we use forms for
User registration
User login
Subscription
Contact Form
Adding/Updating/Removing any kind data to or from the database
In this article, we learn how to create an HTML form.  And we also go through how to handle the form validation. This article will not cover the backend APIs required to Post the data into the application. It&#x27;ll only cover the frontend part.
Lets take a look at this code quickly

Do you want start your blog where you educate others, or may be you want a blog as a repository of all the information you’ve gathered over the years. Anyway, blogs can be a great source of information providers for others as well as yourself. It can really help you connect deep with the content you want to consume. Setting up a blog is easy, especially if you’re a programmer. You can create your own blog with Next.JS and MDX. In this article, I will show you exactly how to do that!
By the end of this article, we will have a blog site for ourselves, which is going to look like this. You can off course make it look more beautiful, but for the sake of tutorial, I made it look very simple.

This article got you covered, not only will it introduce you to the advanced git concepts, but also show you how to use them in a real-world scenario! Let&#x27;s dive in.
Let&#x27;s first check the definition:
Git stash is a built-in command with the distributed version control tool in Git that locally stores all the most recent changes in a workspace and resets the state of the workspace to the prior commit state.
The stash can be thought of as a temporary storage for the changes you made, but did not commit. 
The real-world use case for this feature would be when you are not done working on the changes, but need to pull the updates from the remote repository.
To use stash, you need to add the fi…</span>

I decided to recreate an old Mongolian game that I used to play with my cousins while we spent our days in the countryside. The rules are pretty simple once you get used to it due to the similarities to UNO, a more familiar game to most. 
I would love feedback and comments about the game. Even if you don&#x27;t really have feedback, but want to let me know if you enjoyed the game or not, I would love to know if people played it.

Hashicorp Vault is an opensource software from Hashicorp. Vault is used to manage secrets. 
Secrets can be considered as anything that one uses to authenticate, authorize themselves. Secrets are also pieces of information that are private to any user. 
Examples of secrets:
Username, password
API Tokens
Database credentials
TLS certificates
Credit card information
Applications use a lot of credentials to connect to various external services like databases, message brokers &amp; cloud services. These credentials tend to stay in the config files, source code, version control systems like Github, log files, and plain text files. This form of exposing the secrets and making them vulnerable to unintended access is known as &#x27;state of secret sprawl&#x27;. Vault tries to solve this problem.

1. Centralization of secrets:
2. Access control via ACLS:
3. Audits:
4. Encryption of secrets:
5. Dynamic secrets:
6. Encryption as a service
7. High availability:

                    <span>How to design a URL shortening service like TinyURL?
Software engineers usually struggle with system design interviews partly due to their lack of experience developing large-scale systems and partly due to the unstructured nature of system design interviews. Even advanced and experienced developers find system design interviews challenging since the design questions are open-ended and have no standard answer. To help with that, in my previous post, we discussed a step-by-step approach for solving system design interview questions. Let’s follow that approach to solve a classical system design question: Designing a URL shortening service like TinyURL.
Question Statement: Let’s design a URL shortening service like TinyURL. This service will provide short aliases redirecting to long URLs.

                    <span>微软 Exchange 服务器出现 “2022 年错误”

许多使用 Exchange 邮件系统公司在元旦期间接到了一条 错误报告： “FIP-FS 扫描引擎加载失败，无法将 2201010001 转换为长整型。”这是因为微软在 2022 年伊始发布了新的更新：2201010001 其中 220101 代表 2022 年元旦。而微软在内部使用了一个 32 位的有符号长整型来存储这个版本号，但是有符号的长整型最大值为 2,147,483,647，因此这个版本号溢出了，出现了没有预料到的 “2022 年错误”。为了解决该问题，微软发布了 新的更新 2112330001 —— 嗯这意思 2021 年 12 月 33 日吧。


老王点评：之前我们刚刚说过 glibc 还没默认解决 2038 年错误，没想到微软就赶快站出来表示 2022 年也有问题。




Nvidia 称其智能网卡速度已经超过了存储的世界纪录

Nvidia 的智能网卡配置的 Bluefield 包括了一颗不错的 CPU ，因此它可以运行防火墙或加密引擎等工作负载，这样主板的 CPU 就可以被释放出来用于更重要的任务。在 Nvidia 的一些测试中，数据的移动速度比使用英特尔的 Optane 存储级内存的本地存储更快。Nvidia 称，该结果轻松地超过了“以前使用专有存储产品创造的 1000 万 IOPS 的世界纪录”，达到了 4150 万 IOPS，可以使 400Gb/s 的网络达到饱和。当然，他们也承认，这项测试并没有模拟真实世界的工作负载。


老王点评：智能网卡技术是近年来的网络技术发展的重要发现，这个技术突破很厉害。




Haiku 可以通过 Wine 运行 Windows 应用程序

作为 BeOS 的继任者，Haiku 已经开发了 20 年，在将 Wine 移植到 Haiku 上运行方面正在取得 巨大进展，能够通过 Wine 运行 Windows 应用程序。


老王点评：作为小众操作系统，兼容主流操作系统是非常有必要的。</span>

                    <span>这些应用程序可能不是绝对的必需品，但我很高兴在 2021 年发现了它们。




在这个 2021 年，我目睹了数百个有趣的 Linux 应用程序的开发取得了进展，并因此获得了更多用户。虽然其中一些已经止步，但其它的应用还在继续发展，不断地获得更多的关注和新功能。

虽然我希望我可以对所有这些应用都有所了解，但显然这是不可能的。不过，我已经挑选了 5 个我最喜欢的应用，并在这里与你分享它们。它们可能不会被列入 必需的 Linux 应用程序名单，但我却十分青睐它们。

在开始之前，应该注意的是，所有这些应用程序，除了 EverSticky 之外，都是融合性的，这意味着它们同样适用于桌面和移动 Linux 设备。随着 PinePhone 和 Librem 5 等设备变得越来越流行，我认为融合性应用是相当重要的，看到这么多的此类应用正在开发中，真是太好了。

言归正传，让我们来看看第一个应用程序。

Index



早在 2016 年，当 KDE 发布 Kirigami 时，很明显，它是 KDE 的应用程序的未来。不幸的是，将成千上万的应用程序转换到一个新的 UI 工具包是相当困难的，这导致了 KDE 应用程序之间严重的不一致。

五年后的今天，作为桌面级应用的 UI 工具包，我们终于看到 Kirigami 被真正重视起来，这在文件管理器 Index 中得到了完美的体现。这个漂亮的应用程序能成为 Plasma Mobile 和 Nitrix Linux 的默认文件管理器，自然有原因的。

虽然不像 KDE 的默认文件管理器 Dolphin 那样功能丰富，但它有集成终端、文件预览、标签和分割视图模式等功能。这使得它可以和 Gnome 的 Nautilus 相提并论，同时它还有融合性和基于 Kirigami 的明显优势。

                    <span>探索 Kubernetes 中不同容器日志记录模式的工作原理。




服务器和应用程序日志记录是开发人员、运维人员和安全团队了解应用程序在其生产环境中运行状态的重要工具。

日志记录使运维人员能够确定应用程序和所需组件是否运行平稳，并检测是否发生了异常情况，以便他们能够对这种情况做出反应。

对于开发人员，日志记录提供了在开发期间和之后对代码进行故障排除的可见性。在生产环境中，开发人员通常依赖于没有调试工具的日志记录工具。在加上系统的日志记录，开发人员可以与运维人员携手合作，有效地解决问题。

日志记录工具最重要的受益者是安全团队，尤其是在云原生的环境中。能够从应用程序和系统日志中收集信息使得安全团队能够分析来自身份验证、应用程序访问恶意软件活动的数据，并在需要时进行响应。

Kubernetes 是领先的容器平台，越来越多的应用程序通过 Kubernetes 部署到生产环境。我相信了解 Kubernetes 的日志架构是一项非常重要的工作，每个开发、运维和安全团队都需要认真对待。

在本文中，我将讨论 Kubernetes 中不同容器日志记录模式的工作原理。

系统日志记录和应用日志记录

在深入研究 Kubernetes 日志记录架构之前，我想探索不同的日志记录方法以及这两种功能如何成为 Kubernetes 日志记录的关键特性。

有两种类型的系统组件：在容器中运行的组件和不在容器中运行的组件。例如：


Kubernetes 调度者和 kube-proxy 运行在容器中。

kubelet 和容器运行时不在容器中运行。


与容器日志类似，系统容器日志存储在 /var/log 目录中，你应该定期轮换它们。

在这里，我研究的是容器日志记录。首先，我看一下集群级别的日志记录以及为什么它对集群运维人员很重要。集群日志提供有关集群如何执…</span>

@甜約翰：机智医生生活 第二季

作品信息：2021-06 / 韩国 / 剧集 / 剧情 / 90 分钟 × 12 集 / 豆瓣链接
获奖理由：时隔一年，《机智医生生活》第二季如约而至。本季延续了第一季的剧情，继续讲述律帝医院里，医生、护士、患者们之间平凡琐碎却又温暖人心的故事。吵吵闹闹的「99s」全员回归 —— 搞笑担当李翼俊、理想主义安正元、冷面毒舌金俊完、十级社恐杨硕亨，以及机医五人组的精神支柱、「灵魂歌者」蔡颂华，剧集保持了「机智的请回答宇宙」一以贯之的高品质，是念念不忘又恋恋不舍的个人年度最佳。
不同于传统的医疗职业剧，《机智医生生活》第二季延续了「请回答」系列和「机智」系列的风格 —— 聚焦人、描绘人、挖掘人。本剧以非常规的叙述视角，精准的细节刻画，出人意料的各式反转，性格鲜明的人物群像，以及演员亲自演唱的 OST，把友情、爱情、人情写进了被称为「人生缩影」的医院里，并且较好地平衡了现实主义的无奈与理想主义的浪漫。
剧中没有勾心斗角的职场恩怨，而是一种可以每天吃吃喝喝、每周坚持练团，令人羡慕的成年人的「神仙友情…</span>

在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

自我介绍环节
大家好，我是赵赛坡，我把自己定位为一名内容生产者。
过去十年的时间里，我做过记者、参与过公众号的内容创业。2017 年之后，我开始专注使用邮件通讯（Newsletter）的形式，系统输出我的发现与思考。
我所创建的「Dailyio」是一份由读者付费支持的邮件通讯（Newsletter）产品，每周通过两到三封风格不同、主题迥异的邮件通讯（Newsletter），探讨新时代里的人机关系：

「iPad Power User」聚焦如何使用机器。以 iPad 为平台，关注使用数字工具（机器）及其背后的方法与逻辑；
「AI Insider」以人工智能发展为切入口，记录新技术和技术新趋势带给各行各业的机遇与挑战；
「Deep Reading」以反碎片化阅读的形式，推荐一系列聚焦机器如何定义社会的长文与图书。

撰写了那么多期 Newsletter 以后，你对这种内容形式有什么看法吗？
首先，邮件通讯（Newsletter） 并不是新鲜产品，即便是基于互联网的 邮件通讯（Newsletter） 的历史也非常古老。
其次，最近两年邮件通讯（Newsletter） 的火热，其实是建立在这样一个背景之下：强大的社交媒体（比如 FB）与算法分发（比如 FB 和今日头条）平台，改变了内容链条上的创作者与消费者的关系。
某种意义上说，创作者成…</span>

                    <span>tl;dr? -- Cut to The Chase
Having spent 40 years in the software industry -- as a documentor, developer, and test automator -- I can&#x27;t see that any of the work I did, however relevant at the time, survives:  Nothing beside remains.
Well, it&#x27;s now almost five years since I got retired.  For the first three of those, I worked on projects of my own, blogged, posted here, and contributed some to Ruby&#x27;s spec project.  As for the posts to my blog and posts here, it&#x27;s amazing how quickly the search engines learn to ignore your posts and cast them into the darkness-- think red shift.
Then in September 2019 I came to my senses, and started doing something that will last: contributing enhanced RDoc for the Ruby project itself.
So far, in the Ruby documentation I&#x27;ve:
Added &quot;What&#x27;s Here&quot; sections for about 20 classes and modules.
Re-written the introductory material for about 15 classes and modules.
Re-written entirely the methods documentation for about 15 classes.
Added separate documents for bsearch, dig, and implicit conversion.
From time to time I&#x27;ll post here, linking to some of these changes.
Happy new year!</span>

There are many types of software developer jobs from web developer to data science which is also included in the software field.

This learning journey started for me a few years back but my focus then was around virtualisation platforms and cloud based technologies, I was looking mostly into Infrastructure as Code and Application configuration management with Terraform and Chef. 
Fast forward to March 2021, I was given an amazing oppurtunity to concentrate my efforts around the Cloud Native strategy at Kasten by Veeam.

                    <span>p5.js is a fun JavaScript library for drawing on an HTML5 canvas, and it has some of the clearest tutorials I have seen. It gives you functionality for things like image manipulation, drawing lines and shapes, displaying images, working with trigonometry, and more. And it is especially popular for generative art, such as fractals.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to use p5.js to convert an image like this:

to a mosaic of dots like this:

This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of JavaScript and familiarity with pre-algebra, but prior knowledge of p5.js isn&#x27;t strictly necessary. You can follow along on this by creating an account on the p5.js online editor and logging in. The finished product can be found here.

                    <span>JavaScript single-threaded model


everyone knows that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. In other words, JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.
The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. JavaScript creates the execution contexts and pushes and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution process.
If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function’s execution because the page hangs.
A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions of the webpage, such as mouse click.
A blocking function can be a function that downloads a file from a remote server or …</span>

                    <span>Pluggy makes it so easy to allow users to modify the behavior of a framework without thier specific feature needing to be implemented in the framework itself.
I&#x27;ve really been loving the workflow of frameworks built with pluggy.  The first one that many python devs have experience with is pytest.  I&#x27;ve never created a pytest plugin, and honestly at the time I looked into how they were made was a long time ago and it went over my head.  I use a data pipelining framework called kedro, and have build many plugins for it.
super easy to do
As long as the framework document the hooks that are available and what it passes to them it&#x27;s so easy to make a plugin.  Its just importing the
hook_impl, making a class with a function that represents one of the hooks,
from framework import hook_impl

My goal this year was to beat Bower by the number of downloads. We were able to achieve this goal in November:

pnpm was downloaded about 3 times more in 2021 than in 2020:

These stats don&#x27;t even measure all the different ways that pnpm may be installed!

We collect some unpersonalized stats from our docs using Google Analytics.

Most of our users are from the United States and China.

Our main GitHub repository received +5,000 stars this year.

Our biggest new user this year is Bytedance (the company behind TikTok).

Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Simple! 😉
There are several ways to implement it, but the easiest for me is using Draper gem.
&gt; rails new decorator-rails

&gt; bundle add draper

Well, from this moment when we create a controller it will automatically create our decorator file in app/decorator folder.
&gt; rails g scaffold User first_name last_name

Among other files, the file app/decorators/user_decorator.rb has been created automatically.
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb

class UserDecorator &lt; Draper::Decorator

                    <span>The computing world had periods of obsession with &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; a few times. One such period was during the late 1970s and 1980s when &quot;logic programming&quot; was the big AI idea.
It was so huge and it failed so dismally that by now not only it is largely forgotten, but people rarely even know it ever happened.
Let&#x27;s take a dive into the history of AI, and check Prolog - the language at the center of those AI attempts, and while it&#x27;s not any in-depth analysis, we&#x27;ll bump into a few reasons why it all failed.
Prolog does logic programming, but it also has some basic ability to do regular programming like I/O and so on. Many Prologs also have builtin constraint solver libraries similar to Z3. I&#x27;ll stay away from those parts and mostly focus on the core Prolog.

As you guys know, Python is a popular language that is assisting developers in creating PC, games, mobile, and other types of applications. This is possible due to its libraries that are almost more than 137,000 in number. Crazy right? Moreover, in this world that revolves around data where buyers demand relevant information while buying, big companies or even small start-ups require &quot;data scientists&quot; to get valuable insights by processing massive data sets.

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a linter right now, and one of the requested features for it was code duplication detection. I made an issue for it already, but I need to start working on it. And, that&#x27;s where my question lies. 
I can either build the system to detect the duplications based on plain text. This is how most systems work because it is the simpler of the two options. But, it is also the most failure prone. For instance, this system would fail if there was the same exact code in two places, but there was a comment in the middle of one of them- it would not register as a duplicate.  
Alternatively, I can use an abstract syntax tree to detect the duplications. But, theres another problem there- what is the most-lightweight and all-around-best javascript parser out there? I&#x27;m planning on using the babel parser but I&#x27;m already running into a problem because it doesn&#x27;t parse the comments in a way I would like. 
So, if you have an opinion on what I should do, please leave a comment below. Also, please star the project and contribute if you have time. If you can, that would be amazing, and I thank you so much!</span>

What is OO and why we use ?

Bundling data with the functionality that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some components.
Did we had encapsulation before the OO Languages ? Yes, in C we had perfect encapsulation. The header file contained the signatures of functions and data structures, on the other hand the a .c file would implement them.
The users of our functions and data structures would include  the header file never knowing anything about our implementation. Code exemple:

深度学习不可信

过去 20 年，深度学习透过一系列商业应用逐渐主导了人工智能研究和应用。专家认为，该技术是 不可信的，因为它无法解释，而且不适用于某些应用，因为它会经历灾难性的遗忘。换言之，如果算法有效，无法理解它为什么有效。而当该工具慢慢学习新数据库时，其学习记忆的任意部分可能会突然崩塌。因此在任何攸关生死的应用（例如医疗应用）上使用深度学习都可能存在风险。


老王点评：虽然 AI 也确实在很多领域发挥了重要作用，或具有神奇的效果，但或许我们现在对 AI 的认识还只是盲人摸象。

                    <span>如果你最开始使用的是 Windows 电脑，你很可能会使用“文件夹folder”这个术语。

但当你换到 Linux 时，你会发现文件夹通常被称为“目录directory”。

这可能使一些新的 Linux 用户感到困惑。你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？它们有区别吗？

事情是这样的。如果你愿意，你可以叫它文件夹，如果你喜欢，也可以叫它目录。这没有什么区别。

但是，如果你想知道为什么文件夹在 Linux 中被称为目录，这里有一些解释。

为什么在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录？

在我解释之前，让我们回顾一下文件夹和目录在现实世界中的用途。

在现实中，文件夹（封套）可以用来保存几个文件（或其他项目）。而目录则可以用来维护项目的索引，这样你就可以找到哪个项目位于哪里。



现在，让我们回到目录。这个词甚至在 Linux 存在之前就已经存在了。它来自 UNIX 时代。Linux 继承了 UNIX 的很多东西，这只是其中的一个。

现在让我告诉你一些可能让你吃惊的事情。目录并不是真的把文件放在里面。目录是一个“特殊的文件”，它知道文件在存储中的位置（通过 inode）。

这就说明了为什么它被称为目录。目录用来保存项目的索引，而不用保存项目本身。Linux 和 UNIX 中的目录并不保存它里面的文件。它们只是记录文件位置的信息。

如果你想了解更多关于它的信息，我这篇关于 硬链接 的文章应该可以帮助你。

那么，为什么它被称为文件夹呢？依我看，这是视角的原因。当你在一个图形环境中时，你会将事物可视化。在这里，文件可以像页面一样被可视化，这些文件页面被存储在一个封套（文件夹）中。

当操作系统开始使用图形元素时，我认为一些术语也相应地发生了变化，目录 -&gt; 文件夹就是其中之一。

你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？

这完全取决于你。你可以按你的习惯使用这两个术语。

然而，如果你正在学习 Linux 命令行或经常使用它，使用目录这个术语可能会有一点帮助。

有一些 Linux 命令，如 mkdir、rmdir 等，术语 “dir” 给出了一个提示，即这些命令与目录有关。

同样，许多 Linux 命令和 bash 脚本会使用选项 -d 表示目录，-f 表示文件。

甚至终端中的文件属性也会通过在目录前面加上字母 “d” 来区分文件和文件夹（目录）。

拿这个例子来说，我有一个名为 some 的文件和一个名为 something 的文件夹/目录。请注意各种 Linux 命令是如何用 “dir” 或 “d” 来区分文件和目录的。



所有这些让我觉得，在使用 Linux 命令时，使用 “目录” 这个术语会有好处。你的潜意识会更容易将 “dir” 和 “d” 与目录联系起来。

再说一次，你想叫它文件夹或目录这完全取决于你。人们会明白你指的是什么。

我刚刚对目录一词的历史渊源做了一些分析，这应该会给你一些提示，为什么人们说 “在 Linux/UNIX 中，所有东西都是一个文件”。

现在我结束了我的胡言乱语，我请你对它进行评论。如果你发现任何技术上的不准确之处，请告诉我。

                    <span>除了 System76 宣布了基于 RUST 的新桌面环境之外，还有别的团队也给桌面 Linux 用户带来了一些新东西。




过去的几年里，我们很欣慰地看到 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队正在扩大他们对 Linux 社区的影响。如今，伴随着全新 Maui Shell 的发布，他们的影响也已经得到了进一步扩大。

让我们一起来看看吧！

关于 Maui 项目的一些背景介绍



作为由 Nitrux Linux 团队原班人马创建、开发、维护的项目，Maui 项目已经开发了许多基础应用。实际上，他们的文件管理器 Index 甚至成功进入了我们的 2021 年五大应用列表 之中！

他们的所有应用均使用 MauiKit 这款定制框架开发。基于 Kirigami 的 MauiKit 专注于跨终端融合性，因此开发出来的应用可以在电脑和手机端拥有一致的体验。此外，它为开发者提供了更多的预置组件，因此创建应用可以更加便捷。

目前 Maui 项目开发的部分应用包括：


Index（文件管理器）

Nota（文本编辑器）

VVave（音乐播放器）

Clip（视频播放器）

Pix（图片查看器）


虽然这些自制应用本身质量不错，但它们在 Nitrux Linux 的默认桌面环境 KDE Plasma 里总显得不合群。因此，Maui Shell 应运而生。

Maui Shell 介绍



借助与 Maui 应用相同的 MauiKit 和 Qt 技术底层，Maui Shell 是 Nitrux 在桌面环境领域的一个新尝试。从上面的截图可以看出，它在很大程度上受到了 GNOME Shell 的启发，这在使用过程中也确实有所体现。

但，这并不意味着 Maui Shell 没有原创的地方。从底部上滑可打开类似于 GNOME “活动”的概览界面。与此相邻的是一个小 Dock，可以通过相当美观的启动器来启动应用。右上角有一个与 macOS 相似的控制中心，内有精心设计的菜单和许多控制功能。

在我使用它的过程中，一切都是如此精致、自然。我感觉这与它极致现代、扁平的设计美学有关，我甚至认为 Maui Shell 已经超越了 GNOME 和 KDE Plasma 等同类软件。说到 Plasma，与 Nitrux 的默认 Plasma 版本相比，Maui Shell 在低端设备（和虚拟机）上的反应更加灵敏。

总的来说，我预测 Maui Shell 将依靠其实用性成为 “Linux 桌面环境之王”。然而，我还没谈到 Maui Shell 最核心的特性：跨终端自适应性Convergence。

主流之中的融合

许多人可能还记得 2010 年 Canonical 开发了一款类似的跨终端桌面环境 Unity，它最终以失败落幕，到 2018 年则被完全淘汰了。但是，Unity 和 Maui Shell 有一个共同特性 —— 那就是跨终端融合性。

随着 Linux 在移动端的开发力度逐渐加大，跨终端支持变得尤为重要。由此来看，一个新的桌面环境竟能同时支持桌面端和移动端，的确不可思议。

这一点必须依靠大量的跨终端应用实现，而 Maui 已经处在了完美的衔接点上。这仅仅是我相信 Maui Shell 能成为 Linux 桌面未来的原因之一。

立即试用 Maui Shell

与其他新发布的软件不同，Maui Shell 已经预装于新发布的 Nitrux 1.8。如果你想亲自尝试一下，那请随时从下方链接中获取 ISO 镜像。但是，在尝试之前，请务必知晓：Maui Shell 仍处于早期开发阶段。

尽管 Maui Shell 拥有许多特色功能，但部分功能可能存在问题、尚未实现，要么就是缺失了，其中包括：


蓝牙支持

PulseAudio 支持

网络开关

媒体控制（MPRIs）

拖放支持

多显示器支持

设置应用

XWayland Shell 插件


因此，我暂时不能建议你使用 Maui Shell 作为主力桌面环境。为此，你可能需要等待 2022 年秋季发布的正式版本。

在此之前，我仍将持续关注 Maui Shell。对于这款桌面环境，你的评价如何？欢迎在评论区说出你的想法！

在使用 iPad mini 6 的这一个多月时间里，我发现我又重新拥有了平板电脑。
是的，我太久没有使用过「平板电脑」了，这几年我一直都在使用 iPad Pro 12.9 搭配妙控键盘，它几乎一年 365 天没有离开键盘的时刻，我早已习惯地把 iPad Pro 当成一台触屏电脑使用，而不是可以捧在手中的平板。
iPad mini 6 在我眼里就像是久而未见的老朋友，陌生却又熟悉，让我找回了平板最初的形态，很好地融入了生活。

一.让我们聊聊尺寸
这台小设备有许多可以聊的地方，我想先从「小」这个话题开始讲起，
尺寸是一切
iPad mini 6 的核心在于尺寸，8.3 吋是无压力手持的黄金尺寸。
很多人形容 iPad mini 6 是一个「便携」设备，我觉得这个形容词不够准确。如果我每天都背双肩包上班，那我觉得 12.9 吋的 iPad Pro 很便携；如果我每天只背小挎包出街，那 iPad mini 6 称得上便携。如果我想每天无负担出门，那只有手机还算便携。所以你看，每个人的通勤场景都不一样，对于便携的理解是不一致的。

我的定义是：这一个非常适合手持的阅读设备。无论是两只手捧着，还是单手举着，我都能找回以前看小开本书籍的感觉。
我可以在通勤时拿起它看书，可以在如厕时捧着它消遣，也可以在睡觉前回顾信息。大尺寸 iPad 并不适合在这些场景下使用。

只要我出门带包的情况下，我都会背着 iPad mini 6，因为我总能在包里找一个合适的位置放置它。一定程度上，携带一台 iPad mini 6 并不会给我带来太大负担，这也是 iP…</span>

                    <span>This year, I tried doing Advent of Code for the first time. My goal was to write code solutions in Haskell and JavaScript with more or less equivalent implementations. I have been learning functional programming academically for five or six years, so Advent of Code gave me an opportunity to practice what I have been learning. Unfortunately, things didn&#x27;t go exactly as planned, so here are some of the lessons I learned:
Don&#x27;t rush learning
Just start somewhere
Functional programming has different flavors
Functional programming in JavaScript is meh
Use the strengths of the language



The first two days of Advent of Code went according to plan. I came up with relatively concise solutions in Haskell that translated to idiomatic JavaScript, then wrote blog posts summarizing my approach. Day th…</span>

                    <span>Anayo Debugging 2
This is one simpler issue, but the simplest bug can be the biggest at times, so I made sure I document it and can help anyone out there too.
In my react project&#x27;s root I have a GitLab-ci.yml file that automatically runs whenever I push a commit to the server. It triggers a notification to the runner I specified, and then it processes the series of tasks I specified.
Which involves building and deploying.
This is a legacy React project, and had long been updated. After upgrading the packages I git committed. Build built successfully but deployment failed. With the following error:

I read through the error to understand what the problem really was, and I found it:
Module.createRequire is not a function

That was the only error that was reasonably clear indeed and meant something.
So I Googled it, and I found out that it&#x27;s an issue with Create React App, it&#x27;s always on or looking for the latest, which means the Node engine version has to always be the latest and that includes my npm version, else some things might break.
So in essence whatever machine running that project has to have Node &gt;&#x3D; 14.0.0 and npm &gt;&#x3D; 5.6
My GitLab-ci.yml contains a Docker image with a node version of 10.15.3, so there is a need to upgrade.




image: giona69/node-10.15.3-aws-eb

And I temporarily replaced the docker image with the latest node.




image: node:14.18.2

Rebuilt Node-Sass
I added 
npm rebuild node-sass 
And Voila!! That fixed the issue. These weeks has been simple, this is the issues I have been experiencing.
My name is Anayo Oleru, I specialise in Backend Development(NodeJS &amp; ExpressJS), but I am experienced with Web frontend(ReactJS) and mobile(React-native). And I am open to offers in these fields.
You can follow me on Twitter at @anayooleru or send an email to: anayo_oleru@outlook.com

We will leave 2021 in a few more hours. Is it just me? I feel like 2021 is much shorter than the previous years.
I participated in Polywork&#x27;s #My2021Highlights and created My 2021 Highlights collection. And that&#x27;s when I realize (again) how I grow so much within 1 year!
I had ups and downs, but all of those were worth it.
growing pains. 😄
I&#x27;m writing this post to remind me of what I achieved and overcame throughout this year. It will be something that I will look back to when I have hard times and keep me motivated.

I started to write in November 2020, but not until 2021 when my articles and me, as a writer, started to get recognized. How I achieved so much within one year:
My articles got into CodeNewbie&#x27;s newsletter several times throughout the year since January.

                    <span>This will be multi part post where I will take you through understanding what is NAS? How to setup NAS on your own using Raspberry Pi.
Part 1: Motivation
Part 2: Bake the Pi
Part 3: Install OpenMediaVault
(coming soon...)
Recently I felt a need to have NAS which I can access on my local network and eventually expose it over internet for things like backing up my photos, videos, backups etc. 
But I was hoping it to be more than just a regular NAS. I want it to run other services likes password manager, media player server which I can access on my mobile phone, tv and other devices.
Buying NAS is a good option but it is very costly. So I decided to build one myself. 
This multi-part post is share my experience and steps I followed to setup one for myself.

                    <span>Today we will learn how to create our own directives in Angular. In my previous posts I discussed all the built-in directives which Angular provided. If you are unaware, I would highly suggest you to start from the part_1 ( of the 6 series post).
So the first question that can strike you is why we need a custom directive when Angular already provided us with 6 amazing directives. The simple reason is there can be multiple scenarios where the exact requirements are not met using the built-in directives. In those cases we need to write our own logic to meet the requirement and custom directives comes to the rescue.
Now, lets see how we can create our own custom directive.

                    <span>Today, especially since a deadly epidemic has struck the world, the Internet and smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. We use our phones for almost every day. We used to shop at malls, line up at banks, and plan our trips at agencies. But now, we can do all these things in our homes using smartphones. All of this is made possible by a high-level programming language called Java.
Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) used on the Internet. Java is a high-level language that is also easy to read and understand. Using it, developers can write once and run anywhere, which means that compiled Java code runs on all Java-compatible platforms without the need to recompile.
James Gosling and Sun Microsystems invented the Java programming language in 1991. James wrote…</span>

React is  a Java-script Library used to build UI(User Interfaces)
It is a Open-source project Developed by meta.
In React we built Component that can be Reused.
In React our Focus is to built Components and by combining smaller component we make bigger Components.
Declarative Approach → We Just have to tell the React What to do we don’t have to worry about how it do.
Component-based Design → In React we use Re-useable component so we have to write the less code.
Virtual DOM → So DOM is like a big tree which have the many elements and manipulating the DOM takes time , so what React does is It directly make changes in the Java-script then update in the DOM so that React can Stay Fast.

本周话题：产品化思维
上周四，华为发布了一款血压手表，戴在手腕上就能测血压。

它的实现很独特，可能是第一个这么设计的手表。

大家看上图，它的表带里面有一个垫层，那是一个微型气囊。
测血压时，手表向气囊充气，使它鼓起来挤压手腕（下图），从而感受到心跳和血压。

我看着这个设计，觉得似曾相识，这不就是腕式血压计吗？


华为的这块血压手表，简直就是腕式血压计的迷你版。但是，大家知道吗，两者的差价有多大？前者的官方定价是2988元，后者只要100多元人民币。
当然，我知道不能这样比较，血压手表是智能产品，有许多其他功能。但是，它的主要卖点不就是测血压吗？这一点上，它并不比腕式血压计强太多。你只需要5%的钱，就能得到一个方便程度差不多、测量结果可能更准确的设备。
我并不是说华为这个手表不好，只是感叹两者的差价这么大。为什么那些血压计厂商就没有想到，血压计可以做成一块手表呢？ 
既然已经可以戴在手腕上，为什么不索性做得再小一点呢？加入计时功能，配上彩色屏幕和操作系统，马上就变成了血压手表，价格可以提升一个数量级啊。
这么显而易见的一个产品思路，那么多血压计厂商怎么会无人想到呢？
这就是缺乏&quot;产品化思维&quot;的表现，不善于把功能提升为产品，然后推向市场。 如果腕式血压计的厂商具备产品化思维，看到自己的产品，就会想到手表市场，甚至可穿戴设备市场。反过来，华为的产…</span>

[电影] 爱情神话

关键词：剧情 / 喜剧 / 爱情
片长：112 分钟；豆瓣链接

这就是成年人的爱情啊！

@宇宙浪费指南：《爱情神话》可以说毁誉参半，也可以说叫好不叫座，看电影前我也比较忐忑，鼎鼎大名的「爱在三部曲」我欣赏不来，同类型的片也难有让我惊叹的，不过，这部电影倒是有些超出预期。
这不是一部传统的电影类型片，很多地方它反常规，更多地方也不遵循套路，这里没有两女争一男的俗套戏码，也没有描述中年离异男女生活里的鸡飞狗跳，或许电影的故事发生地设定在上海，沪语的氛围加上上海的格调，才能把文艺中年的爱情拍得有格调但也接地气吧。
很多人用「灵啊」来形容这部电影，不光因为这是一句上海话，也是对导演灵气的夸赞。作为一个外地人，她把上海的精致、文艺和包容力展现得…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70694">

                    <span>搬家到一个陌生的城市，往往意味着对周边一无所知。不仅如此，连社会关系都需要重新构建。在完全适应新生活、找到新的朋友圈之前，如果想要一个人探索新城市，有哪些地方可以去呢？
希望这篇文章可以为你提供一些「新城市中可去之处」的灵感，去哪里、怎么探索，以及如何在新城市迅速找到感兴趣的目的地。
探索的边界
在列出一些可能的目的地之前，可能需要思考一下，你能去到最远的地方是哪里？不同的城市规模也不同，根据偏好的出行方式，即使是同样的出行时间也能去到不同距离的地方。
如果喜欢步行，就可以先从周边的社区开始探索；如果不讨厌公共交通，那隔壁区甚至全市的景点都能去到；可以开车的话，能去的地方就更多了——时间充裕的情况下，连郊区和隔壁城市都能探索一下。
不同的交通工具带来了不同的边界，每个人愿意踏出的距离也不同。如果不常出门的话，不妨从自己舒适的边界内开始探索，习惯了出门再把活动半径慢慢向外延展，用最舒服的方式感受新城市的魅力。
可以去哪里？
可供探索的地方有许多不同的分类方式，在这里我把它们分成了「固定设施」和「限期活动」两类。
「固定设施」指的是那些相对而言固定的建筑，在很长一段时间内都不会有关门谢客的顾虑，什么时候去都可以（不包括疫情这样的意外情况）。除了建筑之外，当地的景观和特色美食也属此列。
「限期活动」则是说只在限定时间内开展的活动，过期不候，像是艺术展或快闪店。对这些活动来说，消息来源是重中之重，我相信谁都不会希望「喜欢的艺术家要来开展了但是我看到 repo 已经是展览结束三天后了」这样的情况发生。
这两类地方的特点和探索方式略有不同，因此会在下面分别介绍。
固定设施
想要从头探索一座城市，最简单的做法是跟随游客的脚步，看看这里的知名景点。
地标景点通常承载了这座城市的历史和文化，在某种程度上，是这座城市过去、现在和未来的缩影。另外，正因为这些景点是大部分游客都不会避开的存在，相关…</span>

                    <span>在我的知识星球「玉树芝兰」上，有一位名叫 Kevin 的朋友提了这样一个问题（简明起见，问题原文经过编辑）：

我是一名工具爱好者，但一直没怎么接触过电脑；对于稍微懂些计算机的人看来是很常识性的东西，我却感到力不从心、没有把握。由于不了解相关的计算机知识和底层逻辑，我虽然也能使用 Zotero、DEVONthink、Obsidian 等生产力工具，但总是浅尝辄止，难以到位；这让我在创作时感到一定的负担，无法达到「随心所欲」的状态。
其实我的要求也不高，就是希望弥补自己的计算机知识，达到足以理解当前所使用工具的程度。但不知道为此需要学习哪些背景知识，例如简明的 Python 语言课程或者计算机通识书籍。很希望老师能推荐一些经典、优质的资源。

我觉得这是个很有代表性的问题，所以在此把答案分享给你。以下是我的答复（有改动）。

Kevin 你好！
我们把问题梳理一下。如果你的需求刚好和工具提供的功能匹配，我想你是不会感觉到「力不从心」的，也不必去顾虑自己对计算机底层逻辑和计算机语言知识欠缺，正常使用就好。你有这个疑问，很可能是因为你的需求与工具功能不完全一致。所以，你想做的，是打造个性化的高效工作流，需要对工具进行改动、补充或者综合。如果我的理解不准确，欢迎你补充。
「懂」与「不懂」，差别在哪？
想想看为什么我们会喜欢效率工具，其实它帮助我们包裹了一些实现细节，给我们提供了好用的功能。如果你对计算机底层了如指掌，那大可不必去追逐工具的更新，或者天天尝试新工具，而应该自己来改造甚至全新设计合适于自己的工具。
就拿编辑器来说，VS Code 出现之前，计算机界「自古以来」有两大阵营，分别是 Vim 和 Emacs 。

Emacs 就是个典型的可扩展工具，号称是「伪装成了编辑器的操作系统」。如果你掌握了 Lisp 语言，那么可以自己开发上面的各种宏和插件，简直就是千变万化。你看，那…</span>

                    <span>自从疫情大流行以来，我们一直就在见证着改变历史的种种大事，从大到政治军事小到口罩文化，对整个世界都产生了不小的影响。而在疫情笼罩下的这一年，足坛也发生了太多事，足以改变和影响未来，年终了我们就来盘一盘，今年的足坛里发生了哪些称的上是“蝴蝶效应”，足够影响未来足坛的事件。
新冠疫情的影响继续，哪天是个头
新冠疫情是这两年全球都逃不开的大背景。不论是国内还是国外，太多人的生活在2020年疫情开始后就彻底改变了命运线，足坛也是如此。
就在我写下这些文字的时候，疫情的影响使得德国等国足球联赛又开始实行空场政策，西班牙等国也重新开始限制观众入场人数，而因为疫情导致多队赛程推迟的英超尽管没有通知停赛或者空场，但像皇马、切尔西、曼联这样人才储备丰富的球队因新冠也面临无人可用。

（图）国际新闻里疫情重新影响足坛
球队缺兵少将是新冠对球队带来的直接冲击，从长远来看，新冠疫情直接影响了足球这项运动赖以生存的场景，也就是与球迷观众形成的互动。
毕竟足球只有在有球迷观众时，流量热度和商业价值才能有的放矢。
据《镜报》报道，疫情影响欧洲足球俱乐部共遭遇87亿欧元损失，其中顶级联赛72亿欧元，其余级别15亿欧元。按收入类别，球票收入损失40亿欧元，赞助收入减少27亿欧元，转播收入减少14亿欧元。报告还表示，整个欧洲共有15家顶级联赛球队37家次级联赛球队申请破产，这一数字超过了2011年35家破产的纪录。


（图）欧足联主席切费林今年“吃”相也很难看
前不久拜仁名宿鲁梅尼格也表示，每进行一次空场比赛时，拜仁会遭受四百多万欧元的收入损失。想想对于拜仁这种家大业大的球队，疫情带来的损失就这么严重，那么对于一些中小俱乐部，几乎就是灭顶之灾。
更令人有所担忧的是，那些已经感染过新冠的球员到底有没有后遗症，有没有后续并发症的影响这个还是个隐藏的不安因素。

                    <span>Whaddup folks! It&#x27;s that time of year again where I do the very very very terrible decision of going to a shooting range and explosives field to destroy USBS and man this year was fun, I got to mess with A C I D and a few toxic folks from tiktok (No you won&#x27;t get my tiktok, ever) to give suggestions on how to destroy, mangle, melt and vaporize my USBS this year... those were some terrible choices, glad I brought earplugs haha.
So first off, I decided I&#x27;d use music to my advantage and I got a very special type of chemical in my posession that quite literally acts like an acid when you sing or play a Bb next to it.
For the rest of my USBS, I decided I&#x27;d go ahead and use a sniper rifle on half, and explode the rest using low grade C4 (learned my lesson from last year using high grade!) and man was that fun!
I can&#x27;t say too much about the rest but I will probably post an image or two to twitter later!
Jonyk5 OUT!

Hi everyone, today is the last day of year 2021 and I wanted to do a year end review and also share my plans for the next year with you all.
Amidst all the chaos of pandemic that 2020 brought upon us, I did not plan extensively for 2021 but instead I focused on a theme.
I wanted the year of 2021 to be my year of YES.
I decided to not hesitate when new opportunities come up and go for exploring new things in life.
There were three high-level things which I wrote to focus on 1st January 2021 in my journal, they were: 
Health
Career
Growth 
I had multiple health issues and I wanted to focus on improving it. 
What did I do about it? 
I did meditation, walking and kept my diet in check for most of the days. And also took consultation from a Doctor whos…</span>

                    <span>The certain situation the world has been in for the past almost two years has affected a lot of us devs all around the globe. This hasn&#x27;t stopped us from delivering amazing software and do good deeds though - Au contraire! Think of global remote hackathons, local efforts to create services that help people in need, providing schools with old laptops, the list goes on. 
Arguably, the tech industry has adapted rather quickly. Video calls became a widespread norm, employees of some companies, like Twitter, can now work from home forever if they want.
(As a little disclaimer: I&#x27;ll use the word &quot;remote&quot; in this post to describe non-onsite things in general, even if you&#x27;re in the same town as your peers.)

                    <span>In this article, we are going to learn how to build a blog and or add a blog section to an already existing Next.js project. To create the content of the blog we are going to be using an extension of the Markdown syntax: MDX.
When using Markdown in a website, there is always a compile step in which all the syntax markdown is converted into the HTML that the browser can understand. The problem with using plain Markdown is that you are limited to the handful amount of HTML elements that markdown is aware of. With MDX, you can extend those elements with your custom React components. It looks something like this:
import {Chart} from &#x27;./snowfall.js&#x27;
export const year &#x3D; 2018

# Last year&#x27;s snowfall In {year}, the snowfall was above average.

                    <span>I’ve been working on a project recently and a bunch of people suggested that I should start using a testing system. This testing system was working for a while but then someone else suggested that I should start using a linter. The linter ended up breaking all of my testing code, and before long I had spend nearly three hours getting them working together. 
Here was the project if you want to check it out
After that, I was told that the code was inconsistently formatted, so I needed to add a prettier system. All of my engineers are now telling me that they have lost countless man-hours battling against this new integration system.
So, I’m getting rid of it. My entire linter system, code grading, beautifier, etc. is gone. And, I’m replacing it with my own solution- if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. 
I want to hear what struggles you have had with your “systems to boost efficiency”, or if you think I am completely wrong and should shut up.</span>

                    <span>As a beginner programmer, it’s difficult to decide which programming language to learn first. The software development industry is fast-paced, and the market is constantly changing. There are over 700 programming languages in use, and each of those languages has its own advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. 
So, how do you decide where to begin? 
Well, the good news is that learning any language will open up doors and create new opportunities for you. In this article, we’ll explore the different types of programming languages, along with how to choose the best first language for your personal and professional goals. Then, we’ll give an overview of some of the most popular languages in use today.
Let’s get started!

                    <span>I wanted to make a compilation of some of the nicest Python projects that have gained popularity on GitHub this week.
As his creator defined, SQLModel is a Python library for interacting with SQL databases. It is based on Python type hints, and it uses Pydantic and SQLAlchemy internally. We can argue that SQLModel is just a layer on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.
SQLModel was created by the same person who created FastAPI, so you can expect a pleasant and flawless integration between both.
Although SQLModel was launched no more than 4 months ago (at the time of writing this), it already offers many features, and some others are already being developed, I encourage you to give it a try.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re looking to learn a new programming language, I recommend checking out Elixir. Elixir is a process-oriented, functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). The language was influenced by Ruby. This inspiration can be seen and felt in Elixir&#x27;s ecosystem and tooling options. Elixir is known to be easy to learn and widely applicable within the software development industry. 
In this beginner&#x27;s tutorial, I&#x27;ll walk you through the Elixir language and discuss its use cases, tools, syntax, and much more.
Let&#x27;s get started!
We’ll cover:
What is Elixir?
Elixir vs Erlang
Elixir features, tools, and uses

                    <span>While some of us might be back to work already after a glorious holiday, some of us will be back after the New Year&#x27;s holiday and will face the inevitable. I am one of the latter and is definitely not quite ready yet.
I am curious on what did you do during the long holiday - either personal and professional wise. Below is my story. 
Spent my leave on staycation. I hang out with the family and in-laws. Lots of shopping and ice skating.


Ate a bunch of unhealthy food I shouldn&#x27;t be eating - more than what I imagined. Major diet after New Year to follow. 😊


Finally, wrote couple of ReactJS articles here at dev.to and created a video version that I am very proud of (still honing my video recording skills). Below are the links if you want to check it out. 



Thanks for the dev.to community for a great, warm support of the articles.

我深怕自己本非美玉，故而不敢加以刻苦琢磨，却又半信自己是块美玉，故又不肯庸庸碌碌，与瓦砾为伍。于是我渐渐地脱离凡尘，疏远世人，结果便是一任愤懑与羞恨日益助长内心那怯弱的自尊心。

也许，很多人初识《山月记》甚至初识中岛敦，都是因为这段话吧，我也是被这个狠狠戳中，才找来原书看。
简单来说，《山月记》可以被认为是一本同人文，小说取材于中国古典故事，如《左传》《论语》《庄子》《史记》《西游记》及唐传奇。中岛敦将古典人物抽离出来，重新灌注以思想，在这本书里，历史不是主线，更不是背景板，主角只有一个个古籍里的人物，有在自傲与自卑之间无所逃遁最终异化为老虎的李征，有不停追问生命意义的沙僧悟净，也有战败被俘后被迫投降的李陵......他笔下的人物超越了史书中刻板印象，变成一个个真实、有血有肉的形象。
有人说，这本书能帮助青年们对抗虚无主义，的确，我们从这些人物中感受到他们在时代和自我之间的对抗、感受孤独、悲悯和勇气。
在李征篇，书中通过他的大量心理对白把他的自恋和自伤展现得淋漓尽致，一个自卑又自负的诗人鲜活的站在我们眼前，而他想一边想入仕一边又鄙夷的想法也深深刺痛一直在懦弱的自尊心和自大的羞耻心之间来回拉扯的读者们；而李陵篇中，书里的三个主角司马迁、李陵和苏武虽是我们耳熟能详的历史人物，中岛敦对他们的故事也有自己的解读，在他的笔下，司马迁不再是那个即使遭遇了如此磨难也毫不动摇的完成《史记》的人，他崩…</span>

                    <span>在前不久举办的 2021 腾讯年度游戏大会（TGDC）上，有不少与游戏行业相关的专业人士都做为嘉宾登台发言，站在他们的领域和角度阐述了自己对游戏发展的看法，其中一个相对冷门的角度却引发了我们的兴趣——青少年网络防沉迷。
在不少家长心中，网络和游戏依然是洪水猛兽。面对家长、社会和孩子之间围绕「如何正确使用网络」而产生的矛盾，我们也不禁思索：拔网线、砸电脑，真的可以挽救已经沉迷网络的孩子吗？到底是什么原因让青少年沉迷网络呢？有没有一些客观的衡量标准来判断一个青少年——甚至一名成人——是否已经沉迷网络？在本期节目中，我们邀请到了中国青少年研究中心少年儿童研究所所长孙宏艳，和我们详细聊聊青少年网络防沉迷的相关话题。

                    <span>科技是一种人文素养，我认为 Swift Playgrounds App 的核心定位正是如此。
未来世界创新、创业、创造的大门，需要我们用一种有着人文温度的方式去开启。
我自己从初中开始看硅谷三大春晚——Apple WWDC 开发者大会、谷歌I/O 大会、微软Build 大会；在高中的时候，虽然身为文科生，但是开始了装「黑苹果」、自学编程的神秘炼金术之旅。Swift 因此成了我的计算机语言母语，而大学时期也很幸运地入选了 WWDC18 奖学金计划，能够带着我们团队自己开发的 App 见到了库克。我们后来休学创业，拿了几轮融资，至今还在这个波诡云谲却充满魔力的创业场拼搏。
这些过去的经历，都成了乔布斯所说的「connecting the dots」的一部分。我和一家做少儿素质与编程教育的机构也有着不少的合作，也带过几支天才少年队伍，看着他们忘我地投入，看着他们迸发着颠覆性创造力的光芒。
由 Apple 推出的编程工具 Swift Playgrounds 近期推出了 4.0 大版本，我使用它开发了一个简单的疫情数据看板 App，并以此作为一次简单的体验，将过程中的思考和体悟和大家分享。
我们为何学习编程、如何学习创造，Apple 给了我们他们的思考。虽然 Swift Playgrounds 现在还充满了各种瑕疵，但我们也看到了全新的可能：AR、AI、传感器、多维交互、物联网，这些前沿的技术，以及伴随其中的人文主义光辉，都能够在这个小小的设备中，经由每一个开发者的研磨，如同坩埚一般，炼就出自己的结晶。
让我们开始吧。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

少数派的朋友们大家好，我是名字很正直的朴步成，名字扒自郭德纲老师的著名相声，是于谦老师众多称呼中，本人最喜欢的一个。是老麦的颜粉，是少数派的读者，看到城市漫游指南系列之后，忍不住想要与大家分享我的小城市，Plymouth 普利茅斯。
机缘巧合我来到了这座海滨城市上大学，对于在海口生活了二十余年的人而言，确实是一件新鲜事。记录一些陪我们走过青春的，一座小城的往事；分享一些对今后，有缘前往南英格兰的朋友们，未必有用的帮助。
英国非著名港口城市 - 普利茅斯

普利茅斯位于南英格兰德文郡（Devon），临近盛产小精灵的康沃尔郡（Cornwall），和如果不查资料无论如何想不起来的：萨默塞特郡、多塞特郡。
苦于其尴尬的城市定位，普利茅斯只能一度自称英国最安全的城市之一，但这没有任何吸引力和含金量的榜单，甚至 2016 年以后也未能再见到普利茅斯的名字。更何况作为旅游目的地，不如可以便宜购物的卡迪夫、「天涯海角」 彭赞斯；求学而言，比起周围的埃克塞特、巴斯，南安普顿和布里斯托又差了不少。

普利茅斯的话，若是独行，便不必去了。
—— 鲁迅
铁轨与行人几乎是触手可及的距离
从伦敦希思罗出了航站楼，直达普利茅斯最舒服的方法是坐大巴，但你若是一个旅行者，绝不能错过驶向南英格兰的火车。切记坐在南边靠窗的位置，火车上最能感受南英格兰壮丽的海岸线。
关于普利茅斯，其实可以不说的一些事儿

这是一个信息爆炸的时代，大多数人陷入信息洪流难以自拔。为了避免这种情况的发生，我们不得不使用一些手段捍卫自己的信息流。

我们需要阅读工作流

每天，我们睁开眼后的第一件事不是上厕所，而是打开手机。手机屏幕已经有十几条早间新闻推送在等候我们的阅读。在通勤路上，我们如果不是在刷短视频，便是在微博、知乎等平台查看一些实时热点。到工作单位以后，我们打开经常访问的网站，查看需要阅读的内容，并将其保存至书签或者稍后读软件。即便是在短暂的如厕时间，打开微博等资讯平台刷一刷早已成为标准操作。
直到睡前的最后一刻，我才发现尽管我每天一直在不停地阅读各种信息，然而绝大部分阅读内容却成为过眼烟云。各种信息如流沙般随风而逝，我甚至想不起我十分钟之前的阅读内容。在饕餮快感之外，我几乎没有多少阅读所得，可能唯一的收获便是阅读内容时所激起情绪涟漪。

那么，如何在信息过载时代高效地处理信息流呢？

从长期来看，自然是提高我们选择、查找、评估和利用信息的技巧和能力，也就是所谓的提高信息素养。然而，提高信息素养并非一朝一夕之事，需要经过一定的训练和长期的实战。从短期来看，比较实用的办法便是建立阅读工作流，以对抗信息流沙。一个可靠的、标准化的阅读流程，可以使我们在尽量减少意志力、情感等精力消耗的情况下，辅助我们高效完成日常的信息管理。

我的信息管理工具
从信息管理的流程来看，我们可以从信息获取、信息阅读和信息处理这三个阶段对信息管理进行分解。

                    <span>I recently made a video covering speedrunning Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s Security Breach, but in the short time since, ALREADY several new tricks have been discovered to slash down FNAF Security Breach completion time to even less than 3 minutes! Won&#x27;t be long till we get close to 2 minutes at this rate!

Team RAR just busted 100 SUPERHERO MYTHS in 24 Hours (https://youtu.be/iurmE2h2r7U) but today we have some unsettling news: someone has broken into the Team RAR Mansion and destroyed the World&#x27;s Tallest Trampoline Tower!!! Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world&#x27;s tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn&#x27;t see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town. Everyone has filmed with this trampoline tower from @David Dobrik, @Drew Dirksen, @Bryce Hall, @Jordan Matter, @Unspeakable, @Ben Azelart and …</span>

                    <span>Today we completely break Cuphead speedruns by using the Mugman Army glitch. This glitch allows us to spawn unlimited Mugman clones, and can results in some extremely fast fights. This speedrun is one of my favorites

My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!

This speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto” tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Celebrate with Miranda, Beatriz and the rest of the “Encanto” family streaming now on Disney+.

                    <span>I’ve been working on building a non-profit, open-source organization for a while now and we have gotten to a solid point in the backend code. We have authentication, an event and rsvp system, profile picture generator, etc. If you want to check it out, you can here. 
I’m also working on a frontend, but I’m at a stage where I can change the stack for it completely, so I wanted to hear your suggestions! You can check out the code so far here, and the domain for the website is fairfieldprogramming.org. 
Do you think I should switch to react, pure html/css, or should I use vue? And how do you think I should communicate with the server?</span>

                    <span>Hello guys, 
instead of a new article, I&#x27;d like to share two printable cheatsheets with you. 
I hope you&#x27;ll find these useful.
The first cheatsheet shows a common development workflow when working on a development project. Among these are:
How to initialize a Git repository
How to add and remove files from the Git repos
How to manage code changes over several new features

Get the PDF from my Git repos: https://github.com/tq-bit/dev-cheatsheets/blob/main/q-bit_cheatsheets_git_and_github_IGit%20Cheatsheet_I.pdf
The second cheatsheet shows you a common, distributed development pattern and visualizes how several maintainers work on the same codebase. 
It attempts to answer the questions about: 
How does a pull request work?
How are local and remote repositories synchronized?
How to delete a remote branch?

                    <span>2021 has been a very challenging and exciting year at the same time but at the end I managed to do the switch I always wanted... 
10 years ago I started my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Information Technology but due to life circumstances I was never able to pursue that career as sometimes life gets in the middle you see. 
I remember, 6 years ago, I was talking with friends and they were asking me what I want to do, what is the dream job for me.. and I remember I was just smiling and I was saying &quot;Web development&quot; and everyone was telling me that I need to focus on that and follow my heart. But in life things aren&#x27;t as straight forward sometimes. 
I was at a point in my life where I didn&#x27;t have the space to think or dream about anything, but I had to do what I had to do in order to pay my bills. Bu…</span>

                    <span>Perhaps the greatest lesson I&#x27;ve learned from creating Agrippa so far is just how important tests are. Of course I knew they were important before - everybody does - but it&#x27;s so easy to just push it aside and focus on more exciting code, or write some perfunctory tests that don&#x27;t really, well, test anything. Eventually, however, slacking off on testing comes back to bite you; for me, luckily, it did when things were only getting started, but the point was clear - writing good tests is a top priority.
For Agrippa, however, writing good tests is far from trivial - it&#x27;s a CLI for generating React components based on a project&#x27;s environment (dependencies, existence of config files, etc.), as well as an optional .agripparc.json config. In other words, a lot of its work is reading &amp; parsing comm…</span>

                    <span>Object-Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming


Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language. Generally, we love object-oriented (OOP) programming! Object-oriented programming makes our code readable, reusable, modular, and is generally pretty simple paradigm to get our heads around.
In Ruby, everything is an object. We generally divide up our code into Classes and Instances, so this isn&#x27;t an unfamiliar concept. Really, everything!
Let&#x27;s try it out!
self
# &#x3D;&gt; main

self.class
# &#x3D;&gt; Object

nil.class
# &#x3D;&gt; NilClass

true.class
# &#x3D;&gt; TrueClass

Even nil? Yes, nil is the singleton instance of NilClass.
Okay, what is this main thing? Well, main is the default top level context provided to us in Ruby. Since everything is an object, we call this the global object. But even our global…</span>

At Facets.cloud we are planning to have a series of articles that aim to explain some of the complex cloud pricing logic and when you need to use them.
AWS RIs are a great way to obtain a discount on your always running workloads (base compute) by committing for certain duration like 1 year or 3 years. Typically, you would look at your base on-demand compute to determine how many RIs to purchase at any time. This is all great in the normal course i.e. your business is growing and you are increasing the cloud spend and possibly buying more RIs time-to-time.
For AWS too, it is a good deal as they get assured future business and lock-in. Another important point to note is that for cloud providers, the cost of an instance, storage or any other services reduces year on year. This…</span>

These eight productivity tips will supercharge your productivity as developer. You&#x27;ll save hours of time which you can then invest in other activities.
This is not a complete list of everything you should be doing, but these things alone will drastically improve your productivity if you are not already doing them.
Lets say you are writing code in an old Java monolith and your flow for every change you make looks something like this:
Save file (1 second)
 Build Project in IDE (5 seconds)
 Deploy application war file into old J2EE container (30 seconds)
For every change it takes 36 seconds before you can get feedback and try out your changes. This might not sound like a lot, but if you are doing this for every change this might happen 50 or more times per day. That&#x27;s 1800 seco…</span>

                    <span>INTRODUCTION
Have you ever run into the red screen of horror while debugging a flutter app?

I mean, if you haven’t, are you a Flutter developer at all?
Out of numerous reasons for your app to relay your error in such a manner, null errors are one of the most common. In an attempt to eliminate this and the numerous null errors that occur while building/debugging your app, the great Flutter and Dart team introduced Null Safety.
In simple terms, Null Safety allows the dart analyser to detect possible null errors pre-compilation, that is, before you even run your app. It ensures proper notifications of possible null data that could break your app while running.
This article is for you, if
You understand the basics of data types in Dart.

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago, I nearly scrolled past this gem on my twitter feed: sync-contribution-graph, by @kefimochi. Go have a look! 
You can use this tool to have your GitHub contribution graph accurately reflect contributions from other accounts you make use of. For example, outside of work I use the handle mtfoley, but I have a separate account I use for my job. I like the idea that I could use this to accurately reflect my activity level, and that no private information about that work handle is revealed.
The way it works is pretty straightforward.  When you configure it with a username and a time frame (year), it performs an HTTP request to the appropriate URL, and parses the HTML in the response for the dates/counts of contributions (these correspond to those little green squares).  Ba…</span>

                    <span>引言
11 月底，一则 「微信更新外链规则」 的新闻在国内引发了不小的涟漪。在《关于〈微信外部链接内容管理规范〉的更新说明》中，微信宣布，将在点对点聊天中允许直接访问外部链接，而在群聊中试行允许直接访问电商类链接。
尽管这条新闻细读之下有些讽刺——本意促进互联互通的链接，竟然要受制于一个平台的生杀予夺，而微信的调整也有点不情不愿、半遮半掩，但这总算是往健康、开放的方向迈了一步。
而同一时间，国外也有一群人在为「链接」的未来发出呼吁。不过，他们想得要更远一些。
12 月初，一份名为 《泛在链接宣言》（Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking）的文档出现在互联网上。简而言之，这份《宣言》（正文翻译见文末附录）向开发者呼吁：通过调整界面设计、提供 API 等方式，让用户能方便地通过链接访问应用内资源，从而提高工作效率、维持专注。

打个比方，如果你在笔记里写了一句「参见周一的会议记录」，那么应该能给「会议记录」四个字加上链接，点击后就能直接打开当时做记录的 Word 文档；在任务清单里写了一条「阅读某篇论文」，应该可以把「论文」链接到想要看的那份 PDF 文件。更理想地，你应该还能在上述 Word 或 PDF 文件中加一个反方向的链接，点击即可直接打开提到了它们的笔记或清单，方便继续写作、标记任务完成等。

如果你对近年红得发紫的「双向链接」笔记有所耳闻，应该会觉得上面的描述看着挺眼熟——这差不多就是将笔记场景中的双向链接推广和化用到了系统的各个角落。
确实，这些效果本来也不是什么「黑科技」，目前都能在某种程度上实现，只是远不够完美：要么依赖于应用和平台的特殊支持，但老死不相往来；要么薄如蝉翼，容易随着文件移动、设备更换而失效；要么晦涩难用，让普通用户一看就打消了学习的念头。
《泛在链接宣言》所呼吁的，正是让这种灵活的链接用法变得更通用、开放、稳固和易用。…</span>

                    <span>在每年的最后一个季度，下一年的新手帐本就逐渐上市，我会在预售阶段就挑选好新年的手帐。近些年来手帐市场不断回暖，不少人都准备在手帐上开启新的一年。手帐已经成为我生活中很重要的一部分。我用它规划时间、记录生活，随时随地写下自己的所见所感。在一年结束之时，面对满满一本的字迹与拼贴，回忆这一年里的点点滴滴，总能有别样感受。
什么是手帐？为什么需要一本手帐？
「手帐」（手帳，techō）是一个日语词，在中文中与之最相近的概念应当是「行事历」，但近年来手帐的流行趋势已经和只关注规划、待办事项的行事历有了区别。这件事同样体现在西方的手帐社区。当大家提及手帐时，使用的不只是代表行事历的「Planner」，更多的还有「Journal」——它除了记录待办事项、规划生活之外，还可以作为日记进行生活记录，用文字、插图、贴画等等一系列内容填充带有分区设计的本子，形成一个属于自己的生活轨迹地图。

手帐文化中，「自由度」是非常重要的元素。本质上，选择一本手帐的过程，就是设计自己的生活笔记体系的过程。每个人的需求各有不同，手帐社区中有不少人常常分享自己的手帐体系（比如上图的视频作者 AmandaRachLee，知名文具/日志/美妆 YouTuber），介绍手帐本的各种用法。也有很多资深用户在使用大量的量产手帐之后，选择自己购买空白本，从零开始设计这一年的手帐体系。所以我在这里需要强调，如果你想记录自己的生活，并不一定要购买专门的手帐本，你需要的只是一份持之以恒的心思，以及对自己生活的一些关注与反思，就能设计出最最适合自己的手帐体系。
但对于此前从未接触过手帐的人来说，想要入门手帐体系，最好还是从现成的专门手帐本入手。尤其已经经历大量市场考验的手帐品牌与型号，它们的本子设计已经经过了无数次调整（甚至每年都有…</span>

                    <span>2021 年已然接近尾声，以 Notion 为代表的「块编辑器」经过多年的发展也早已不是新鲜概念，成为了新兴文字编辑器的 de facto 交互选择。
Craft 在 1.0 时代就因其完整的文字编辑功能、优秀的共享协作体验，以及拥有非 electron-based 的跨 macOS、iOS、iPadOS 三大平台的原生客户端而饱受好评。Craft 让文字工作者在 Apple 生态圈中首次拥有了支持多人协作的原生「块编辑器」，且 Craft 目标明确 —— 专心做好以「原生客户端」为重心的线上文档协作、个人文档撰写的最佳工具。

少数派 2020 年度应用：这 16 款年度应用，和往年不太一样
在 iOS、macOS 和 iPadOS 三端都拥有原生客户端的 Craft。
事实上，Craft 1.0 也做到了这一点：专注文字撰写，放弃做一个「大一统」应用，让使用 Craft 的我们专注于自己的个性化 workflow，而非以应用本身为中心来调整自己。但我们在工作学习中，不可能全程使用同一个应用，我们需要浏览网站、浏览其他应用来获取信息，需要在应用中处理、编辑内容，需要将内容导出、发布、分享、汇总。为此，在 Craft 2.0 大版本更新中，Craft X —— Craft 自己的「插件、扩展系统」应运而生。
Craft X 设计理念
Craft eXtension，简称 Craft X，是 Craft 2.0 时代的重磅更新，为 Craft 核心编辑体验带来更多可能性。Craft X 的重点是一套完整的 Craft API，用来辅助我们在 Craft 中的工作流。其中我们在前文的介绍中所讲，Craft X 的设计理念…</span>

它是做卫生的大魔王工具
是的，我认为它是整理家庭卫生的「大魔王」。没有它处理不了的污渍。无论是泼在地上的汤汤水水，还是洒在地上的颜料，抑或是顽固的油污，抱歉，蒸汽拖把没在怕的。有它在基本上不存在解决不了的地面污渍。
出国在外，很长一段时间家里是我妈在做卫生，所以我一直不知道家里卫生是怎么做的。等我回来，我才发现家里换了个我没见过的玩意儿。后来才知道是蒸汽拖把。回来后就换我做家里的卫生，于是第一项任务就是解决家里厨房那被油烟熏入味儿的地面。
怎么说那个地面呢，就像是地表有一层浅浅的胶水，拖鞋走上去、抬起来，会发出「嘶啦」的声音，粘滞感有，但没有那么强，属于那种让你能感觉得到，却不会造成你行动不便的程度。毫不夸张地说，拖一遍以后，地砖就发出了光泽。你能明显感觉到那股粘滞感已经基本消失。拖鞋踩在上面再也没有那种「嘶啦声」发出。一切顺滑，恢复了地砖该有的平滑感觉。
效果真的显著
它是洗地机吗
先说结论，它「不是」洗地机。
借着这次搬家，我才想着说，把这东西拎出来讲一讲。一开始我以为这东西挺冷门，最后在飞书群一问，挺多人想看看的。
可能初看很多人都会认为这是个洗地机。其实它是蒸汽拖把哒（DIO 脸）！最常见的洗地机我相信大家都看过，就是某些型号的洒水车。我们平时路上会见到那种车身两边带着旋转型刷头的那种洒水车，就是比较常见的「洗地机」。体积笨重、需要一定的操作能力。然后再简化一下，就是家用的洗地机了。
比较好一点的家用洗地机，就是 KARCHER 的洗地机。刚解除隔离的那天，我就迫不及待地驱车去家附近的山姆会员店逛逛了。刚好电器区有 KAR…</span>

                    <span>Nearly a year ago I deployed a multiplayer feature for Farmhand, an open source and web-based farming game that I created. Since that initial deployment, the multiplayer system has experienced no downtime or service degradation. And best of all, I&#x27;ve paid nothing to host the service and therefore I am able to allow others to play for free. This article is an overview of how I designed this system from the ground up.
In short, Farmhand is a game that mixes farming and market mechanics. The goal is to buy seeds for a low price, plant and harvest them, and then sell the crops at a high price. Prices fluctuate from day-to-day, so you&#x27;ll have to be smart about your buy/sell decisions.
Farmhand was initially designed as a single-player game and seed/crop values were randomly generated at the sta…</span>

                    <span>Interviewee: José Valim, the creator of Elixir, Chief Adoption Officer at Dashbit;
Japanese Translation
Hi, José,
Masakazu Mori (He made a presentation at ElixirConf US 2021 [1]) and I lecture the course &quot;Programming Theory&quot; at the University of Kitakyushu, including the mainstream programming paradigms: imperative programming, OOP, and functional programming, relating to the history of the architecture of the computer systems. Of course, one of the course&#x27;s main topics is &quot;Why Elixir?&quot;. In Programming Elixir [2], Dave Thomas said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to hide data. I want to transform it.&quot; I identified this consideration as a new programming paradigm instead of functional programming: The data transformation paradigm.
So, I want to interview you about the history of what you consider about desig…</span>

                    <span>When I first moved to vim from and ide like vscode or sublime text one of my very first issues was trying to preview my website at localhost:8000.  There had always just been a button there to do it in all of my other editors, not vim.  There are not many buttons for anything in vim.  While there is probably a plugin that can run a webserver for me in vim, it&#x27;s not necessary, we just need the command line we are already in.
You will need a way to run another process alongside vim, here are a couple ideas to get you going that are not the focus here.style
use background jobs


c-z to send a job to the background
fg to bring it back

                    <span>Depois de várias tentativas sem sucesso, enfim consegui virtualizar um macOS para fazer testes em um aplicativo iOS no qual eu estava trabalhando.
Mas antes de continuar, é necessário saber que essa não é uma solução estável e possue diversos problemas de desempenho, porém, para meu propósito consegui fazer o que queria.
Nós utilizaremos o QEMU para emular um macOS e dentro dele, utilizaremos o xCode para emular um iOS, só nisso você já consegue perceber que não vai ser uma coisa leve.
O repositório no github do Docker OSX tem uma explicação de como usar um iPhone via usb ao invés de emular, mas eu não tenho iPhone :p

But now!!!! when I see back in time currently I m doing great progress and easily learning new technologies😁.
But actually what I did or steps I took cause of which I m doing great progress within a year.

Many things helped me learning new technical things but let start this first article let me share with you how Open Source helped me
How I m Learning new Technologies so Quickly is coming soon...)

                    <span>Last time, we successfully generated a DNS Query and get the results from the DNS server.
I would like to analyze this result, but this data is compressed.
In this Section. I&#x27;ll explain about dns compression.
According to  (RFC1035)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035], We can specify the location to be referenced by OFFSET in the following format.
a domain name represented as a sequence of labels, where each label consists of a length octet followed by that number of octets.  

The domain name terminates with the zero length octet for the null label of the root.

                    <span>Oh the technical interviews, I am a 15 years experienced software engineer and I&#x27;m still afraid of them!. So we as human beings fear the unknown, but a good interview should be more like a conversation instead of a police interrogation.
Interviewers have asked me if I know S.O.L.I.D. principles, unit testing in deep and even I&#x27;ve been asked to use graph theory to solve a problem. When I got the job, there is a high dependency on a specific dll that do a lot of different things (This by it&#x27;s own violates all SOLID principles), I never used anything they asked me, so what&#x27;s the need to make the technical interview unnecessarily complex and tedious?. When I am interviewing a candidate I try to make a conversation like: Tell me about your experience, the latest project you are working on, what technology you like the most, and why. I guess that they are trying to emulate top-tech companies like GAFAM, what I have heard about these companies is that the technical interviews are very focused on data structures and problem-solving (not sure if they are used in daily work).
My point is: if your company focuses on a specific product, ask what you&#x27;re looking for, ask for the technologies you are currently using, please stop doing stupidly complex technical tests unless your company is currently using these techniques to solve complex problems.
And as always, happy coding!.</span>

                    <span>This tutorial was originally published here.
Welcome to the Secrets of MicroPython tutorial series! MicroPython is an incredible tool for rapidly prototyping and iterating on hardware projects. It&#x27;s similar to Arduino but instead of using C++, which you have to re-compile each time you make a code change, it runs on the Python interpreter which allows you to run code changes immediately. The quick feedback cycle enabled by MicroPython will, I believe, power the future of embedded development.
What is the &quot;hello world&quot; of embedded software? Why, blinking an LED, of course! In this first tutorial, we&#x27;ll get you acquainted with the fundamentals of MicroPython and more importantly, the online simulator we&#x27;ll be using for all the tutorials.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on my website for some time now, but it felt like there was something missing. I wasn&#x27;t really sure what it was, so I ignored it for a bit of time. Later that week, I was hanging out with friends and we started making puns about ducks- &quot;wisequacks&quot;. That&#x27;s when I had a moment of realization. 
I decided to drop everything that I was doing and build a really simple API for duck jokes. Right now the API has a couple of jokes, but we need some more, so if you want to submit some, you can respond to this issue or you can just drop a pull request on this repository. 
You can check out the joke API here and you can use it in any of your projects if you would like. All of the code for the project can be found in the linked repository and it is all under the MIT license if you want to use it in your own project. Cheers! 
Make Sure to Drop the Repository a Star if You Like It!

                    <span>现在你已经很难找到一款带有 3.5mm 耳机插孔的数码设备了。
这或许是厂商「希望」听音乐不再有线材的束缚，也或许是真的技术发展所致导致设备已经容纳不了一个小小的 3.5mm 耳机接口了，似乎真的要和有线耳机拜拜了？除了换成「真无线耳机」之外，有没有什么办法让我们耗费巨资购买的有线耳机也能赶上时代，重新在手机上继续发光发热，甚至可以兼顾无线耳机的便携性以及高保真耳机的高音质呢？
传统耳机也能「无线听歌」
上面一大段并非是个人臆想，而是自己的亲身经历——拥有一条四千块大洋拿下的威士顿 W50，又换上了索尼的 MUC-M12SM2 耳机线——我希望既不需要更换手上的高品质设备，又能「无线听歌」。
好在威士顿 W50 采用的是 MMCX 插孔的可换线设计，因此变成蓝牙耳机其实并不复杂——再买一个索尼 MUC-M2BT1 蓝牙耳机的适配器就可以秒变挂脖式的蓝牙耳机。因为原生支持 LDAC 无线蓝牙技术，这样实现即保证了音质（CD 级别的无损音频传输），又摆脱的线材的束缚。不过这种解决方案也存在不方便之处，一方面是想再次换回 3.5mm 耳机插孔的时候，需要频繁地换线插拔接口，另一方面就是无法预测蓝牙适配器的电量使用情况，经常听到一半突然没电。更重要的是，我的索尼 MUC-M12SM2 耳机线就无用武之地了。
可将任意 2.5/3.5mm 有线耳机「蓝牙化」
所以拿到飞傲 BTR5 2021 时，我第一时间就是将耳机线接了回去，然后将它和我的安卓手机进行蓝牙配对——BTR5 2021 支持 LDAC 蓝牙音频协议，至少保证了最为基本的无损音质（接近 CD 品质的无损音频），而 3.5mm 耳机口的输出让我不用频繁换线就能继续使用我的 W50。
也可有线获得更高音质
BTR5 2021 还标配一个小夹子水晶壳，出街的时候可以非常方便地夹在衣服或者裤子口袋中，还自带一个小的麦克风，有电话…</span>

                    <span>人类种植稻米的历史起源于中国。大米作为市面上最常见也是最为人所熟知的主食，经过数以千年记的发展、改良和创新，已经成为全球产量第二的食物。1中国自古就有「鱼米之乡」等词汇，充分体现了大米对于中国百姓生活的影响。而法国名厨乔治斯·奥古斯特·艾斯可菲（1848–1935）也曾感叹：「米饭是世界上最好、最营养的——而且毫无疑问，它也是最普遍的主食。」由此不难看出，无论对于东方还是西方人，米饭都有这独特而浓厚的吸引力。
那么，作为一种看似平凡却又历史悠久的食物，我们又有哪些方法可以在家庭餐桌上折腾出新花样呢？今天本文就列举一些好吃又好看的碳水大餐！
开篇之前：袁隆平大米上架少数派商城啦
蒸一碗热腾腾的米饭，再炒两个快手菜，能让胃和身体都温暖起来，驱走冬日的严寒。我们也专门为我派读者们准备了由国货品牌「隆平农场」出品的高品质大米「袁隆平大米」。这款大米产自东北辽河，从苗种到耕种都经过精心培育，好吃不贵。
「袁隆平大米」5 公斤装原价 79 元，我派商城特惠价 69 元。

基础材料和准备
既然聊米饭的烹饪，那重头戏当然就是米啦。我家的口味是喜欢吃东北大米，口感圆润，极富光泽感，颗粒分明又入口软糯，看着一碗可爱蓬蓬的、发亮的米饭总是会有幸福感，有时都不需要太多配菜，好的米干吃起来都不至于乏味涩嘴，并且煮干煮稀都适用，既可以粒粒分明也可以浓浓汤水。
我认为好好吃饭是生活中看似日常却会潜移默化影响身心的事情，越基础的食材越重要。有时宁愿多肥两斤，也不愿放弃碳水的快乐。

家电厨具就是电饭煲、砂锅等一般家庭中都有配备的用品，只是煮白米饭的话用电饭锅就可以了，方便又快捷。不过依据我的个人经验，电饭煲的价格、工艺对煮出来的饭确实是有一定影响的，在米本身处于及格线的情况下，更好的材质、设计、用料能让同一款米的食用体验更上档次。
砂锅作为传统烹饪工具，在有时间的情况下选用它更能…</span>

Apple Music：2021 音乐回忆
如往常一样，Apple Music 2021 音乐回忆带你回顾一年中最爱的音乐与艺人。在 Apple Music 的「现在就听」页面下拉至底部，就能找到「音乐回忆」栏目。这一歌单其实在今年 2 月份就已经支持添加到资料库了，并且支持每周动态更新。
如果你没有找到，可以点击 这个链接 在网页端打开后生成「音乐回忆 2021」播放列表，并添加到资料库。
「音乐回忆」会根据你在 Apple Music 上的所有听歌记录，统计两类年度数据，分别是播放次数最多的歌曲排行 Top 100、累计播放时间最长的艺人排行。对于单首歌曲、艺人，还会标注累计的总时长信息。除了查看官方生成的「音乐回忆」外，你还可以将「音乐回忆」添加到 Apple Music 形成播放列表。

除了「音乐回忆」外，在 12 月 1 日，Apple 上线了 2021 年 Apple Music 榜单。你可以在 Apple Music 搜索「2021 Top songs」或者是「百大」等关键词查看。2021 年 Apple Music 全球榜中最受欢迎的歌曲是防弹少年团的 Dynamite，其次是 Ariana Grande 的 Positions，接下来是史墨克的 For The Night 。
除了全球外，Apple Music 还针对不同国家和地区推出了 Top 100，比如 中国大陆地区 依然是被周杰伦霸榜，甚至 Top 10 中有 9 首都是周杰伦的歌曲。港澳地区 Top 1 则是林家谦 一人之境 in C maj…</span>

作为如今生活中不可或缺的一种文件格式，PDF 承载了太多内容形式 —— 海报、画册、宣传页、合同、报价单、教科书…… 其中可能需要签字、修改、阅读、批注的，也不在少数。现在，一直以来仅在 Windows 上有客户端的 PDF 标注软件 Drawboard PDF 也已经登陆 iOS 和 iPadOS，就让我们一探究竟。

在 iOS 和 iPadOS 上，Drawboard PDF 用起来怎么样？和 iPadOS 自带的 PencilKit，或者是 GoodNotes 一类笔记软件相比，Drawboard PDF 有什么优劣？在 iOS 上批注 PDF 方式如此之多的今日，Drawboard 是否值得迁移？

相信看完这篇文章，上面的几个问题，你的心中都会有满意的答案。
从各处打开 PDF 文档，还可以免费创建空白文档
如果你和我一样是 Drawboard 的新用户，打开 Drawboard PDF 的那一刻，app 会提示登录账户。除了可以使用传统的邮箱注册之外，当然也可以使用 Apple ID 来登录；或者，Drawboard PDF 也提供了不登录直接使用 Essentials 基本功能的选项。如果在体验后你发现自己无需使用高级功能，那么不注册账号也完全不会影响到 Drawboard PDF 的使用 —— 清爽、简单、直接，这也是 Drawboard PDF 给我的第一感觉。

2021 年 11 月 12 日早上 9:09，还没有把工位的椅子捂热乎，我收到了三周前预定的新 MacBook Pro 14。

这篇文章的主角不是它，但也因它而起。
在这之前，我自己的主力机是 2015 年的 MacBook Pro 13，和一台 15 年组装的 PC ，显卡还是 750 Ti。今年 618 的时候，买了一台明基 PD2705Q 2K 显示器替换掉了原来的 AOC 的某款忘记型号的 1080P 显示器。因为知道下半年 Apple 一定会发布新的 MacBook Pro，所以我在挑选显示器的时候，除了色彩之外最看重的可能就是 Type-C 反向供电功能了，我不太想本来就很小的桌面空间上还有各种各样的线。
但是都 2021 年了，我为什么还要买一台 2K 分辨率的显示器呢？看我当时的主力设备就知道了，老 Mac 加老 PC 组合，我尝试过 4K 显示器，买的是 PHILIPS-279C9，买回来之后发现有一些色偏，背光不均匀以及电脑会卡……于是我就退掉了，换成现在这款，他满足了我对色彩、价格、Type-C 供电等等一切需求，唯有分辨率是硬伤了。
不过 2K 也还好，PC 下没有问题，老 MBP 上也可以开启 HiDPI，并没有感到有很强的颗粒感。对于 Intel 系列的 MacBook Pro 开启 HiDPI 的方式，是按照我派的 这一篇文章 进行设置的。
一切的美好都在我连上了新的 MacBook Pro 之后结束了……

                    <span>2021 年是 Epic Games 公司成立 30 周年，在科技产业，这足以称得上是一家“老”公司。但这家公司为更广泛的科技圈以及大众所认知，好像也就只在最近几年。在过去一段时间里，元宇宙 (metaverse) 概念兴起，Epic 凭借虚幻引擎 (Unreal Engine, UE) 和社交游戏堡垒之夜 (Fortnite: Battle Royale)，从一家游戏开发商的定位，跃升到了离元宇宙最近的少数几家公司之一。
玩家群体对 Epic Games 当然不陌生，不少 3A 级的游戏都通过虚幻引擎开发。对于海外玩家来说，Epic 旗下的堡垒之夜最高月活跃用户在 2020 年超过了 8000 万，是海外最受欢迎的竞技类游戏。在过去几年，美国的中学和大学举办电竞，最多人参与的项目必然是堡垒之夜。对于中国玩家来说，备受关注的黑神话：悟空就是使用 UE5 开发，并且得到了 Epic 官方的技术支持。Epic Games 也在不同场合秀出 UE5 的“肌肉”，包括在 PS5 主机上的实机展示，最近也有黑客帝国：觉醒的 demo 供玩家体验。

在相当一段时间以来，Epic 是我最感兴趣的公司之一。我在美国读书的时候，学校离 Epic 总部只有 20 分钟车程。Epic 所在的北卡州 Cary 市是一个富人小镇，也是一个 foodie town。虽然我也偶尔去 Cary 饕餮一番，但却没有机会走近 Epic 一睹真容。但因为离得不远，也结识了几个在 Epic 工作的朋友。

少年极客


Tim Sweeney 1970 年出生于美国东海岸马里兰州 Potomac 市，是家中三兄弟里面年纪最小的一个。Tim 的两个哥哥分别比他年长 15 岁和 10 岁——当 Tim 开始读小学时，两个哥哥离家读大学甚至已经毕业了，因此 Tim 在成年以前的大部分时间更像是家中独子，受到父母的关照。


和很多天才极客的成长故事类似，Tim Sweeney 在年幼的时候就喜欢捣鼓各类工具和机械设备。他曾经把家里的收音机、电视机和割草机 (一般美国家庭用来除草和平整草坪) 逐一拆解，来研究机械的运作原理。在五岁时，Tim 把家里的割草机拆解，然后再重新组装成一辆能够驾驶的卡丁车。他对于各种机械的兴趣，后来也逐渐延伸到了计算机和各类技术领域。


七十年代，电子游戏行业开始逐渐在美国建立。Noland Bushnell 在 1972 年创立雅达利 (Atari) 公司，并且相继推出了第一款在商业上取得成功的街机游戏 Pong 和后来风靡全球的 Space Invaders (国内玩家称为“小蜜蜂”，雅达利从日本大东公司购买了版权)，依靠投币式街机的游戏厅也开始在美国流行。Tim 十岁时，离家里不远处开了一家游戏厅，和很多青少年一样，Tim 也在里面流连忘返。后来，父母干脆买了一台 Atari 2600 家…</span>

DIO，美国重金属摇滚乐队，成立于1982年。成员包括主唱罗尼·詹姆斯·迪欧(DIO)、吉他手安东尼·伊奥米、鼓手威廉·沃德、贝斯手泰伦斯·巴特勒马龙·白兰度（Marlon Brando），美国著名影视演员、导演。代表作《教父》
乔纳森·乔斯达
大乔的形象应该出自原创，但名字的来历就有很多说法了
起初，荒木老师在06年特别访谈中说是家庭餐厅的名字（Jonathan)，因为最初在这家餐厅与编辑讨论漫画，所以以此命名。这应该是大家都听说过的
不过后来，荒木又在JOJOVELLER HISTORY中亲口否认了这点。椛岛良介也表示最初是在另一家餐厅进行磋商的，连载途中才变更到Jonathan。 
JOJOVELLER HISTORY
但事实上，日本关东确实有一个大型连锁家庭餐厅，名字也确实是乔纳森
Jonathan
关于前后表述不一问题，荒木老师本人是这样解释的 ↓↓↓
JOJOVOLLER HISTORY
别问，问就是老师自己也忘了
P.S：网上流传有另一种说法：在著名吸血鬼题材小说，爱尔兰作家斯托克的《德古拉》中，有一名重要角色名字即为乔纳森。
威廉·A·齐贝林
齐贝林家族的姓氏，来自于英国摇滚乐队Led Zeppelin（齐贝林飞艇）

                    <span>提到JOJO中的超自然力量，大概诸位都会想到替身、波纹、与吸血鬼
不过，你是否会想到罗马占卜术，暗杀风水学呢？
这篇文章，会粗浅整理JOJO世界观下的超自然力量体系。展现一个，JOJO式的奇妙世界之冰山一角

本文分三部分，分别为『基本世界』『新世界』『番外』
顾名思义，基本世界为1-6部，新世界为第七部往后的作品，番外则是《岸边露伴一动不动》《死神之Q》等非正篇内容

起点——基本世界

由吸血鬼对人类或尸体进行转化，制造出的物种，身体力量强于人类，听命于制造者
2、夜之一族（闇之一族）
アイアイアァァァ
上古生物，族人被称为『柱中人』，位于地球食物链顶端的生物，是一切生物的天敌，以吸血鬼为食
身体强度极强，拥有比吸血鬼更强大的力量，速度，和细胞活性。能通过接触同化细胞的方式吞噬其他生物
2.1、流法
夜之一族（柱男）通过开发身体完成的，近似于魔法的技术
2.2、石鬼面（石之假面）

                    <span>身为一名替身使者你应该了解的知识
替身，STAND，JOJO系列作品中最核心的设定，也是日本战斗漫画史上的一个独特旗帜
本文将深入整理讨论替身设定，围绕替身体系最基础的『规则』展开
八代JOJO合影以及混入其中的贾一乐
目录

基础设定（来自飙马野郎第十卷）
替身规则与逾矩者
STAND or 幽波纹？
你可以这样成为替身使者
替身的分类

一、基础设定
“无”中生不出“有”来，此乃世人常用的表现句子之一
不过那是“仅止于过去的表现句”
现代物理学已经证实在毫无一物的“无”&#x3D;“绝对真空”当中……有时会突然产生出名为“素粒子”的超微小粒子[1]
而……“素粒子”能够变化出能量来，也就是说素粒子会突然变成能量，然后突然又凭空消失
刚刚所提到的“素粒子”并不是发生在遥远的宇宙彼端，或仅存于理论当中的事情
而是在这地球的日常生活当中，也随时随地都在发生，相当不足为奇的事情
以上述这些知识为前提，在《JOJO的奇妙冒险》这部作品当中，为求方便，个人便将由人类所引发出来的这股精神能量称之为“替身”
本作品将以绘画（或是影像）来表现这股目不可视的“精神能量”
例如会有这样的表现方式：

在人类或动物的背后，其精神层面将会以经过设计的角色图案浮现出来
此角色（指疯狂钻石）要是以拳头攻击，现实世界的物质就会遭到破坏

有时其精神层面会依附在“刀剑”或“手枪”等武器当中再浮现出来
也有些会附着在“人偶”、“卡片、扑克牌”、“船”、“车”、“锁”、“文字”等道具或日常物品当中。它们都会有所动作，或是进行攻击
（图中为阿努比斯神、性感手枪、黑檀木恶魔、欧里西斯神、力、命运之轮、心锁、天堂之门。对应黑体字）

也有的精神层面是以很小型，数量却很多的形状表现出来
有的会以部分肉体显露出来
（图中为收成者、女皇、迷途猫）
而拥有以心灵看见“替身”的才能之人……称为“替身使者”

                    <span>【小记】
一场疫情似乎把所有出境旅行的计划都打破了，但却让我们又一次发现我大中华的锦绣山河，这么的绝美又壮阔；它的云朵不像 瑞士 ，山脉不像阿尔卑斯，它不用模仿任何地方，它有属于自己的名字，它就叫 新疆 巩留 …


【快乐的定格照片】
对于 新疆 的印象是从小时候姥爷给我带回来的红色花帽，色彩浓烈，挂满了漂亮的玻璃珠子~再后来就是跟AJ恋爱后一起去的 喀纳斯 跟 禾木 村，零下40°的冬天，坐雪地摩托他直接把脸冻伤了哈哈哈。
这次来 巩留 就是无意间看到了云杉林，自驾在 新疆 的无界草原可以拥抱最清新的氧气，没有过多的游客，是一片还没沾染凡尘的人间仙境…
忘不了泛着青蓝色湖水的恰甫其海…

忘不了光着脚踩在 库尔 德宁的秘密森林…

忘不了阳光白云下的云杉林...

忘不了下着暴雨，雪山渐渐隐去的恰西山顶…

忘不了 塔里 木途中的原始哈萨克木屋…

忘不了经常拦路的羊咩咩和牧羊人，有时候还有牧羊犬...

我遗忘在那里的记忆太多太多，以至于现在看到某张照片会突然笑起来，阳光天也好，暴雨倾盆也罢，都是旅行画笔下的一抹彩虹。

巩留 ，这是在 伊犁 的一个小县城，但真论起来它也不小，土地面积4528平方千米你感受一下哈哈。静静的坐落在 伊犁 河谷中，于 伊犁 河的上游而生，网上关于它的信息特别少，所以我做足了攻略才决定出发。

【行程】
Day1： 北京 — 伊犁 — 巩留
Day2：恰甫其海— 库尔 德宁
Day3： 塔里 木风景区—恰西风景区
Day4：野核桃沟—蝶湖
Day5： 巩留 — 伊犁 市区— 北京
【交通】
1、 北京 — 伊宁 — 巩留
我是从 北京 出发，首都机场飞 伊宁 （中途会在 克拉玛依 经停），飞行时长6H左右；然后自驾前往 巩留 2H。
2、 上海 / 江苏 —（ 乌鲁木齐 ）— 伊宁 — 巩留
我有小伙伴从 上海 或者 江苏 其他省份最方便的…</span>

                    <span>You missed THIS in Gladiator. When Maximus makes his first appearance in the Colosseum, he asks the men fighting with him if any of them “ever served in the army” to which one replies that he served with him at Vindobona. This shows that even though Maximus has been trying to keep his identity a secret, at least one other prisoner has known who he was the entire time and never said a thing, because that’s how much respect Maximus commanded from his men.

                    <span>Watch as Marines surprise this World War Two veteran.

When Marines arrived in Port Everglades for Fleet Week, the local sheriff informed them that there was a true war hero who lived nearby, and that he had a very particular problem the Marines might be able to help him with. 

The man was a Marine aviator who piloted planes in World War Two and had over a hundred combat missions in the Korean War. Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. 

Captain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.</span>

Cache Poisoning at Scale
           
Cache Poinsoning is basically tricky CDN to generate a bad content for the same cache key, by leveraging a vulnerability where the servers and the cache key isn’t consistent.  Even though Web Cache Poisoning has been around for years, the increasing complexity in technology stacks constantly introduces unexpected behaviour which can be abused to achieve novel cache poisoning attacks

Hello, people! You probably already saw or read one of those articles like “Web developer roadmap in 2021”, “How to become a web developer”, etc. So, I also wanted to share my perspective on this topic that might be useful to some people who are at the start of their exciting journey or open some discussion with others.

Learning Web in 2021 is not a straight line (Photo by Mark König on Unsplash)
I want to start with the most basic and the important, as well as, sometimes, overlooked part of the Web — HTML. Why overlooked? Thanks to some great JavaScript frameworks, like React, web developers frequently deal with “components” rather than HTML elements. However, it is important to understand semantic HTML and accessibility and many…</span>

A lot of performance issues can be improved using cache, there is a lot of tools out here but for this brief tutorial I&#x27;ll choose the well-known Nginx.
You can clone the branch nginx-cache or follow this tutorial (I&#x27;ll only cover the nginx stuff)

How is a world created? (Worldbuilding)
In Worldbuilding there is two methods of creation, the first is called &quot;top-down&quot;, where you create the world&#x27;s cultures, its inhabitants, civilizations and then the geographic features, it&#x27;s the option that i will try to avoid, since i want to create the world historically, so from year 0 to year i-dont-know. The other method is the first but inverted, so it&#x27;s called &quot;bottom-up&quot;, where you create the geographic features, such as continents, tectonic plates, biomes and then the cultures, civilizations and more. I will try to use the &quot;bottom-up&quot; method, it&#x27;s just what i want. 
I want to create a world organically, so as i&#x27;m going to use the &quot;bottom-up&quot; method, i will create the world terrain first and then adapt the cultures on it. So, …</span>

                    <span>Heya! The final part of this twitter bot series is here. 
In the first part of this series, we&#x27;ve taken a look at creating a twitter bot in .NET that listens to particular tweets and retweets them. For the second part we created Api endpoints for  it, so it now has the capability to change its tweet stream rules whilst listening at the same time. This final part is where we deploy our twitter bot to the Pi, lets go!
his is the link to the repo (here). It includes the previous changes as well as what will occur during the course of this blog.
In order for this to work, we will need a couple of things to have at hand:
A Raspberry Pi
Setting up the Pi with SSH (link here)


Please take note of the OS chosen during the setup for later

                    <span>Hello! Welcome to this first post in a series where we try to build our own deep learning library in Python.
In this post, we will go begin to write a simple feedforward neural network. 
We will only work on the forward pass in this post and we will work on training our network in the next post.
This post will cover how basic feedforward neural networks take in a input and produce an output from it. 
Neural networks are a machine learning technique which is loosely inspired by the model of the brain.
As with all machine learning techniques, it learns from a dataset which contains inputs and their corresponding outputs.
Neural networks consist of layers. Each layer is connected to the next layer with weights and biases. These weights and biases are used by the network to calculate the outpu…</span>

                    <span>Any developer knows how difficult it can be to find the right code online that is safe, secure and reliable. We use these building blocks as a basis to build programs, but searching for this code online can be time consuming, not to mention untrustworthy. You may spend precious time sourcing code that turns out to be outdated or unsafe, leading to a lot of wasted time that could have been avoided. 
At Codiga, we firmly believe that whether you work alone or with a team of developers, coding should be a truly collaborative experience.

                    <span>O Que é o Sentry?
Basicamente, o sentry é uma ferramenta que nos auxilia na captura de erros que acontecem nas nossas aplicações em modo debug e também em produção.
é só isso mesmo!!!
Bora ver como isso funciona?

Crie uma conta no sentry


Vai em Criar um projeto e selecione a plataforma ( no nosso caso, REACT NATIVE ) e clica em Criar projeto.





  
  
  Agora no nosso projeto React Native


1 - Instalar a biblioteca de integração do Sentry com o React Native.
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
# or
yarn add @sentry/react-native

2 - Adicionar o Sentry no nosso aplicativo
Você pode adicionar a chamada do sentry no seu app.js ou app.ts da seguinte maneira:
import * as Sentry from &quot;@sentry/react-native&quot;;

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SUA_DSN_AQUI
});

Sua DSN aparece logo após você criar o seu projeto React Native na plataforma do Sentry
3 - Faça o build da sua aplicação novamente
 yarn android 
 ou
 yarn ios

E pronto, sua aplicação agora está sendo monitorada pelo sentry, e qualquer erro ele vai te mostrar em uma dashboard da plataforma.
Você também consegue ver algumas métricas do dispositivo do usuário, como:
Nível de bateria, network que estava sendo utilizada no momento do crash, IP e etc...
É isso galera, qualquer dúvida deixe nos comentários :D</span>

                    <span>Hello.
We will create a simple white-board with a web-socket.
The white-board is just an empty screen to draw lines.
We need an SVG to draw lines and a web-socket to keep shearing the image.
Let’s get it started.
First we need to create the client side.
To use a web-socket we need to create a WebSocket object.
To get data from the server we need to subscribe to the message events.
To send data use the “send” method.
To draw a line we press the left mouse button at the start of a line and release at the end.
In the mouse up event handler we create a string from a template.
Now we need the server.
Create a new WebSocketObject.
To start the server open the folder and type “node index.js”.
Let’s check it out.
Thank you for watching to the end. 
script.js
const socket &#x3D; new WebSocket(&#x27;ws://localhost:8080&#x27;);
const svg &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;svg&#x27;);
const path &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;path&#x27;);
let e0;

socket.addEventListener(&#x27;message&#x27;, e &#x3D;&gt; {
   path.setAttributeNS(null, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x60;${e.data}&#x60;);
});

svg.addEventListener(&#x27;mousedown&#x27;, e &#x3D;&gt; e0 &#x3D; e);

svg.addEventListener(&#x27;mouseup&#x27;, e &#x3D;&gt; {
   socket.send(&#x60;M ${e0.offsetX} ${e0.offsetY} L ${e.offsetX} ${e.offsetY}&#x60;);
});

index.js
import {WebSocketServer} from &#x27;ws&#x27;;

const wss &#x3D; new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});
const connections &#x3D; [];
let d &#x3D; &#x27;&#x27;;

wss.on(&#x27;connection&#x27;, ws &#x3D;&gt; {
    connections.push(ws);
    ws.on(&#x27;message&#x27;, onMessage);
    ws.send(d, {binary: false});
});

const onMessage &#x3D; data &#x3D;&gt; {
    d +&#x3D; data;
    connections.forEach(ws &#x3D;&gt; ws.send(d, {binary: false}));
};

/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
Check your path and make sure path includes your brew location.


Check path: echo $PATH | tr &quot;:&quot; &quot;\n&quot;\n

Brew location: which brew

(Probably something like /opt/homebrew/bin)
If the location is missing, then add it to your ~/.zshrc, like this: export PATH&#x3D;/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH

brew install starship
echo &#x27;eval &quot;$(starship init zsh)&quot;&#x27; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc

值得关注的 App
虽然少数派一直在为大家发发现和介绍各平台上的优质 App，但仍有不少设计、功能、交互、体验都非常优秀的 App，还没有被我们发掘和介绍。它们可能是一款老 App，也可能是近期上架的新 App，我们会在这里介绍给你。
NoteCircle：把你想做的事装进一个地方

平台：iOS / iPadOS
关键词：任务管理、待办清单、提醒事项

@Vanilla：又是待办事项 App？我相信很多人看到这一类 App 已经开始出现天然的抗拒感，一方面是因为待办事项 App 已经多如牛毛，另一方面是大多数人已经破除了对这一类工具的迷信。就算真的需要待办事项工具，绝大部分人的需求都可以在任意一个简单的工具上实现，所以选择时的痛点已经转化成了平台选择和设计选择，换句话说就是选一个好看的、能用的就行。今天要介绍的 NoteCircle 就是一个设计别致以及勉强能用的待办事项 App。
NoteCircle 借鉴了纸质笔记本的设计，通过标签将主要功能分为了 Todo、Routine、Event、Checklist 四大部分。
Todo 就是待办事项，添加时只能设置名称、时间和日期、提醒等简单的选项，操作时也只能勾选完成或者取消勾选两个动作，没有其它的手势操作。如果需要对待办事项重新排序，需要点击右上角的排序按钮进入相应的界面，通过拖动来将它们放到我想要的位置。在 Todo 模块还有一个每周目标的功能，创建后会可以固定在 Todo 界面的顶部，然后将 To…</span>

                    <span>Windows 8 及 Windows Phone 时代微软引入了应用商店，彼时在部分 Windows 版本中应用商店更是唯一安装应用的途径。不过微软显然高估了自己在开发者当中的号召力，商店中应用寥寥。之后微软给出了传统应用转制商店应用的解决方案换来了些许生机，但从来没打开过 Microsoft Store 的 Windows 用户至今不在少数。
今年 6 月，微软终于放下了执念，宣布 推出一个更加开放，有着更多 App 的应用商店：接受采用各种 API、各类打包方式的应用，商店的抽成也大幅度降低。在这之后，每隔一段时间就有某些知名的 App 上架 Microsoft Store 的新闻。现在的 Microsoft Store 或许终于能满足用户绝大多数应用的下载需求了。
本文就带大家概览目前在 Microsoft Store 上架的那些优秀应用。知名应用会几句话带过，若少数派有相关文章本文也会一并附上，算是带领大家做一个回顾。
部分应用可能需要将Windows 区域设置为其他国家或地区（比如美国）才能检索到。
为什么选择 Microsoft Store
我想每一个 Windows 用户都希望有一个官方的安全便利的应用下载途径，正如业务主管 Panos Panay 在 谈及 Microsoft Store 时所说：

我非常憧憬这样一种体验：打开商店，键入 App 的名字，然后你就能下载到想要的 App。

犹记得刚刚接触 Windows，我会在搜索引擎中检索应用名，蠢蠢地点击下载站提供的「高速下载」按钮，双击下载的文件后，弹出的不是应用安装向导，而是默认勾选名字炫酷的游戏和安全卫士的 xx 高速下载器。直到今天，各类下载站仍然盘踞在搜索结果的前列。

相较于下载站，使用由微软提供的应用商店显然更让人放心。而相较于四处寻找官网或者软件包管理器，在 Microsoft Sto…</span>

                    <span>究竟使用什么样的器材或者什么样的器材才算足够好得拍好照片，是一直困扰着很多人的问题。机缘巧合之下，我拿到了一台来自于十六年前的相机：佳能的 EOS 350d。它诞生于 2005 年，机身和镜头总重量为 500 克，拥有一块 800 万像素的传感器，7 点对焦系统，搭配的是一支 18mm-55mm 的镜头，采用 cf 卡进行记录，有一块 1.8 英寸的屏幕。
无论是多么宽容的人，都会承认这是一台性能全方面落伍的相机。我拿到手的时候，简单检查了一下，发现右手握持部分的胶皮已经没有了，储存卡的弹窗已经没有了弹力，镜头上全是手指印，甚至镜头盖也没有了。这进一步让我对这台相机的成像素质不敢抱有什么期望。
可以说是相当的 old fashion 了
因为工作关系，我需要用它来拍摄一些报道的图片。于是我突发奇想，为什么不看看我把这台相机一整天都带在身边会拍出什么样的图片呢？于是乎，一整个周六我都一直把它带着，用完两块电池，也拍了不少照片。这里，我邀请大家和这台十六岁的相机一起陪我度过一个普通的周六。在放出图片的同时，我也会把当时图片拍摄前的想法一起分享出来，也复盘一下当时拍摄的心境。
前期准备
毕竟这是一台上了年纪的相机，所以在拍摄方面也不能够按照现在相机的标准去苛求它的表现。因为这台相机只有 7 个对焦点，往往只有中间的对焦点才采用对焦比较精准的十字对焦点，所以我在拍摄的时候一般采用中心对焦点对焦然后重新构图的方式进行对焦。
在拍摄模式方面，主要采用 a 档（光圈优先）和 p 档（程序优先）进行拍摄。同时，本机没有自动 ISO 功能，所以我只能手动调整，在白天的时候感光度定在 100 或者 400 ，晚上或者室内的时候感光度定在800（最高感光度是 1600 ）。
8:00 AM 赶路和车站
如果需要在赶路的时候拍照，拍到是最重要的。这个时候我一般把感光度设置成 400，采用程序优先模…</span>

                    <span>虽然大家总在吐槽微信的各种不方便，但无论是工作、学习还是生活，我们总是难以完全摆脱它。最近，微信推出了网页版「文件传输助手」，允许用户在不登陆电脑客户端的情况下，实现手机和电脑的文件互传。
编注：经测试，WeChat（微信海外版）用户可能无法登录网页版「文件传输助手」，建议使用微信国内版账户登录。
怎么用，好用吗？
在浏览器中打开 https://filehelper.weixin.qq.com/ 并扫码登录即可使用网页版文件传输助手，登录之后会显示如下图的对话框。与客户端的「文件传输助手」一样，你只需要输入文字、拖动文件就能在电脑和手机之间相互传输，几乎没有上手门槛。

在使用体验上，网页版「文件传输助手」与客户端差别不大。不过网页版有一个优势在于不会占用登录名额。微信在此前推出了多端登录功能，但实际上只支持「手机 + 平板 + 电脑」各一台，用户不能登录两台同一类别的设备（比如同时登录两台电脑，先登录的那一端就会强制下线）。
网页版「文件传输助手」则不会占用这个登录名额，你可以通过网页版文件传输助手来实现多端同时在线。如果在网页端上传了一份文件，其他所有客户端都会显示传输了该文件。
除了不占用登录名额外，网页版「文件传输助手」还有两个优势：

泛用性：只要有浏览器就可以使用。在大学教室等公共场合，不需要为了传输文件而单独安装一个微信客户端。
私密性：不知道你有没有遇到过，在公共场合登录微信，结果聊天记录被同步过去而导致的「社死」现场。而网页版「文件传输助手」只能用于文件传输，并不同步联系人信息、聊天记录，在公共场合使用时能够保护你的隐私数据不被他人看到。

可以传多大的文件？
与客户端相同，网页版「微信传输助手」支持传输最大 1GB 的文件。但如果所传输的是一个大文件，需要在客户端进行点击「接收文件」才会开始下载。这一点需要特别注意，避免发生文件传输了，但是在需要用的时候发现还没下载，甚至已经过期的尴尬情况。
当文件从网页版微信上传之后，除了可以「接受文件」下载之外，还可以在不下载的情况下，直接一键将文件转发给需要的联系人。点进文件详情页面，点击下方的「发送给朋友」即可直接选择好友发送。
也就是说，如果你想通过微信将某个电脑文件发给微信好友，你可以通过网页版「文件传输助手」将它发送给自己，随后直接转发给对方，省去了下载的麻烦。

总结
在一定程度上，网页版「文件传输助手」很好地解决了在公共场合、他人电脑上传输文件所带来的不便和尴尬。而且，当你关闭「文件传输助手」窗口后，原本的传输记录也会一并消失。既可以达到传输文件的目的，又可以避免了个人隐私的泄漏。
总的来说，网页版「文件传输助手」算是解决了微信跨平台传输文件的痛点。再加上它的低门槛和隐私性，以后去打印店打印东西，或者在公共场合的电脑上传文件再也不用担心变「社死」现场了。

韦伯望远镜发射升空，将观测宇宙初期状态
美国东部时间 12 月 25 日上午 7 点 20 分，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜（James Webb Space Telescope, JWST）在经过多次延期后，在法属圭亚那航天中心由阿丽亚娜五号火箭运载升空。接下来，韦伯空间望远镜还需要滑行约一个月、顺利进入预定轨道后方可开展观测工作。
韦伯空间望远镜是哈勃太空望远镜和斯皮策空间望远镜的后继计划。但与绕近地轨道公转的哈勃望远镜不同，韦伯望远镜放置于遥远的第二拉格朗日点，将在距地球 150 万公里处绕太阳轨道运行。
韦伯空间望远镜主要的任务是调查大爆炸理论的残余红外线证据（宇宙微波背景辐射），即观测今天可见宇宙的初期状态。为此，它拥有一个总直径 6.5 米，被分割成 18 面镜片的主镜，面积为哈勃空间望远镜的5倍以上；此外，附带了高灵敏度红外电传感器、光谱器、可折叠遮光板等。
韦伯望远镜的最早发射日期定在 2007 年，预算为 5 亿美元，而如今实际花费已经超过百亿美元，是国际空间站之后最昂贵的太空设施项目。来源

荷兰监管机构要求 Apple 允许约会类应用使用第三方支付系统处理内购
荷兰消费者和市场管理局于 12 月 24 日发布了一项最新的裁决，要求 Apple 必须允许「约会类」应用（如 Tinder）使用非 Apple 的支付系统处理内购。如果 Apple 在 2022 年 1 月 15 日之前未能执行该裁决，则将会面临巨额的罚款，罚款金额最高可达 5000 万欧元。这项新裁决不适用其他应用类别，例如游戏类以及其他应用类的内购。
对此，Apple 表示不会认可这项裁决，并已经提起上诉。此前，在美国与 Epic 的诉讼案中，法院支持了 Epic 关于开放第三方支付的诉求，但该判决在 Apple 提交上诉后被上诉法院暂缓执行。来源

                    <span>作为题主问题中截图人之一（李靓莉），我必须要来答一下。
我们所谓“喝汤没营养”是有前提的，也从没有否认祖国美食博大精深。广东人煲汤我也很爱喝啊！也不是站在“对立面”而是区分优先级~
就来说说我主要说的：婴幼儿群体。为什么说对婴幼儿来说，喝汤没营养？
一、为什么不推荐孩子喝汤？
1、孩子胃容量很有限，汤的营养密度太低
孩子的口味太小了，所以要把有限的胃容量给到对生长发育更重要的食物。比如奶、富含蛋白质的动物性食物，以及可以有效快速供能的主食类。
所以我们会提倡给孩子优先提供“高营养密度”的食物。尤其是一些生长发育不是很好，体重增加比较缓慢的宝宝，我们会说，能吃干的就别吃水的。也就是说，能吃饭的别喝粥，能吃固体的，就别吃流质。也就是这个道理，同等的体积下，让孩子可以摄入更多的能量和营养物质。帮助孩子的生长发育。
2、汤真的没那么重要
对一岁内的孩子来说，优先保证奶量是最重要的。在此基础上是动物性食物，主食。蔬菜水果对一岁内的孩子来说，如果胃口有限，都不是必需的，更别提汤了。


二、汤有营养吗？
有，水分居多。
很多人会觉得汤有营养，尤其是白白的一层。这其实也是我们长久以来的误区。比如白色的骨汤汤，联想到了白色的骨头，喝白色的骨头汤&#x3D;能补钙&#x3D;长骨头、长高。
骨头汤是熬制猪骨后的汤水，汤水颜色发白，味道浓郁（我承认是蛮好喝的… ）。骨头虽然是富含钙的食材，可并不代表骨头熬汤可以把骨头里的钙给析出。
骨头汤在熬制的时候，被析出的只有骨头里的骨髓，其中就含有大量的脂肪。
经过高温反复滚煮后就变成了奶白色，而浓郁的味道同样是脂肪带来的（想想全脂奶 vs 脱脂奶）。
除了脂肪被大量析出，会有极少量的蛋白质和微量元素也会被析出。
至于钙？
除非你把猪骨嚼碎了吃下去（恐怕也是吸收不了的呢）。
和骨头汤类似被认为特别有营养的汤还有鱼汤、小排汤和鸡汤。对于这些荤汤，如果你只喝汤水不吃肉，那同样是在喝一锅富含脂肪的汤水。
哺乳期的妈妈如果喝多了，还会增加堵奶风险！

三、那不能喝汤了吗？
当然不是。
汤虽然不是宝宝每餐要有的食物，但如果可以保证奶量的基础上，并且每餐的完成度也不错。其实根据家庭的饮食习惯还是可以喝的。
一岁以下的宝宝：
不要经常喝。由于肠胃功能不完善，经常喝汤是不可取的。本不大的胃喝汤之后，也会影响其他食物的摄入。并且在辅食添加的初期，喝汤无法锻炼孩子的咀嚼能力。
至于一岁以上的宝宝：
适当增加。保证其他食物摄入的前提下，在平时的饮食中增加一些汤羹类食物，也是丰富孩子餐桌形式的方式。
当然，喝汤更要吃汤里的东西。相比很稀的汤，我更推荐浓稠一些的类型。
【宝宝罗宋汤】

罗宋汤是一道经典的汤羹。酸酸甜甜的底味能够很大的勾起孩子的食欲，让人大开胃口。这道汤中除了番茄酱（可自制番茄酱）不可替换外，其余食材都是可以自由变换的哦～无添加的番茄酱品牌：「笑厨」、「西域日记」供参考。


【丝瓜鳕鱼蛋花汤】
鳕鱼不仅可以蒸和煎，还能放在汤里噢。总体的食材搭配均衡，完成度也很棒，这汤当然可以喝。



好啦，今天就到这里！
总之，我们不是站在“对立面”而是区分优先级~~

                    <span>食了冬至圆
就长大一岁啦
今天是冬至，今年的最后一个节气。说起冬至，你会想起什么画面呢？
杜甫说：“云物不殊乡国异，教儿且覆掌中杯”；汪曾祺写：“家人闲坐，灯火可亲”。这一年中最漫长的黑夜，要回到家里，跟亲人一起度过。

南方的冬至，湿冷气直往骨子里钻，暮色更显沉重，所以大人早早下班，小孩早早放学，关门闭窗，万家灯火通明。是团聚，给予人们抵御“至暗时刻”的勇气。
虽然是最深的黑夜，却也是转折之时。过了冬至，日头渐长，春意从此萌动。可能正是因为这特殊时刻的特殊触感，南方人十分重视这一天，“冬至大如年”呀，晚上一起搓圆子，早上醒来还要拜祭祖先神灵。





在南方人眼里，冬至还能预测未来的气候。最有趣的是南京人这句谚语：“邋遢冬至干净年，干净冬至邋遢年”，不是指人的穿着，而是说冬至晴好，则过年有雨雪，反之亦然。今年你们那儿的冬至，又是什么天气呢？
因为重视，所以南方的冬至风味也格外丰富。当大部分北方人依然用一盘饺子问候冬至时，南方各地，家家户户的门窗里，飘出的是五花八门的冬至味道——





带馅的、不带馅的，甜的、咸的，大的、小的汤圆，每一颗都是团团圆圆的希冀；广东的糯米团子，浙江的年糕、糯米饭同样寓意满满；苏州人在饮冬酿酒，全年只此一杯；湖南、江西人在吃熏腊肉，烟熏风味此刻最美；四川人独爱一碗热气腾腾的羊汤，广东人架起一桌好菜，鸡鸭鱼肉应有尽有。





冷风中熬过冬至，不需要靠一身正气，家人在身旁，热汤热菜在嘴边，总有一味温暖人心。


不只是汤圆
南方到底有多少种“团子”？
“家家捣米做汤圆，知是明朝冬至天”，搓圆子吃汤圆，南方冬至夜的第一要事。不只是汤圆，很多地方吃的糯米团子，也是冬至常客，所以这句诗还有另一种说法：“家家捣米做米团，定是明日冬至节”。





浙江朋友告诉我，南方团子的差异大得离谱，尤其是加上方言之后：浙南地区的人叫冬至圆，潮汕地区的人叫冬节…</span>

                    <span>怒花近4万检测费，测了15款鸭血，用实测结果告诉你：咱们吃的鸭血，到底是真是假。


前段时间测了真假羊肉串后，后台一直有朋友问：魏老爸，听说鸭血也有假的，还有的会加胶水！顺道儿给测测呗？



鸭血有假，这事儿确实不假，前几个月还有监管部门曝出：某知名火锅店用了假鸭血。



身边也有同事作证，他老家的环境不适宜养鸭子，当地也不兴吃鸭子。
据他的圈内好友说，当地吃的鸭血，九成九都是假的。



正好这天气冷了，火锅里的各种食材确实得安排上了，ok，那咱就给大家来测一测！ 
我们在各大买菜平台、菜市场、知名火锅店、楼下麻辣烫店等各个渠道购买了14份鸭血。



还专门拜托开头的同事，代购了他家当地卖的鸭血。



最后，集齐了15款鸭血，然后送去实验室，检测了它们的“真实身份”。
全家福如下：

样品费1069.23 元 +检测费38240元 &#x3D;合计39309.23元
这些鸭血到底是真是假？鸭血里面真的会加胶水吗？还能不能愉快地涮火锅了？
我们一起往下看结果。

一、我们吃的鸭血，到底是真是假？
假鸭血一般都是用牛血、猪血冒充的，原因很简单，它们个头大、血量多，价格自然就低了。
之前某明星的火锅店爆雷，就是因为被曝出用了牛血冒充鸭血。
也有一些黑作坊，会用鸡血来冒充鸭血。



所以我们这次把15款鸭血的猪、牛、鸡、鸭四种源性全部测了一遍。



结果让人大吃一惊：16款鸭血，居然有15款都是真的。
连同事代购的不养鸭子、不吃鸭子的家乡当地鸭血，都是真的。（心在滴血，钱包在流泪！！！）

只有2号鸭血检出了鸡血成分：



 结果翻出存样后，我不禁陷入了沉思......原来人家早就“老实交代”了，早早就在配料表中标出了【鸡血】成分。



我们拆开这份鸭·鸡血，和普通鸭血做了对比，发现他们的颜色、质地几乎没啥差别，看来光从外观上是很难区分了。

建议大家在买鸭血时，还是得多…</span>

                    <span>每到冬天的时候，我都会去到更冷的地方旅行，原因是我想看看那句“北国风光，千里冰封，万里雪飘”的真正光景，毕竟零下20度的冰雪世界，北京是肯定看不见的啦~
但在黑河，我能一眼望到俄罗斯~

我们是怎么做到一脚跨两国咧~
行程： 
DAY1：五大连池—温泊—北引泉 
DAY2：瑷珲汽车越野赛—瑷珲条约纪念馆—瑷珲知青馆 
DAY3：四嘉子满族乡“颁金节”—关东民俗村 
DAY4：俄罗斯布拉戈维申斯克市
（ps：我是2018年末的时候去的，现在想去的小伙伴一定要问清楚当地的防疫政策呀~）





从北京出发，乘飞机到哈尔滨机场，原计划直接从哈尔滨继续飞五大连池，但航司临时变动，下午的飞机被调到早晨，所以只能取消。所以我们直接从哈尔滨开车到五大连池，大概3个多小时~



高中地理老师说的五大连池
高中地理老师天天念叨的五大连池，这次终于见了第一面~它并不是单指五湖池水，而是一大片区域。大概在1719年-1721年间，火山喷发阻塞河道，形成五个相互连接的湖泊，所以叫五大连池。









就在我们去的温泊，大概零下20度+，遇到超好看的雾凇、冰挂，再加上8°+的温泊水，真真有种童话世界的感觉。







中间有出树上因为冰雪积压成了冰挂，刚刚好弯成一圈~逆光的时候透过晶莹剔透的冰挂折射出超美的冰挂。Emmm，有一瞬间觉得自己是仙境里的小仙女哈哈~



50公分厚结冰上的冬捕
每年冬天黑河这边都会有冬捕，最重要的是人们从四面八方赶来，趁着捕鱼时节图个好彩头。



捕鱼前的传统仪式很有喜庆的味道，锣鼓声天和冰上的民族舞，都颇有一番民俗的风味~









我估计附近的、旅行的人都来凑热闹了，人群太大，我真的挤不进去哈哈哈，透着人缝看到渔民正在收网，据说冬捕的头鱼能被拍卖到8888哈哈，真假不知道，但大家图个头彩的乐子我倒是领教了~

                    <span>各位许久不见，我是片冈智！
有关《水仙》的（实拍）电影化，这里也稍稍写下我个人的感想。


事实上至今为止，无论是日本还是美国的制片商，都曾有过电影化的提案。
而最终拒绝的理由，虽然有好几个……但其中最重要的，则是故事最后“让濑津美的病治好了”的结局设计吧。
有关最后（濑津美）走向大海的情节，如果是将其做暧昧处理的话倒还可行，然而“治好病了真好呢！”这种“廉价的结局”却是难以容许的。
我想做出这种结局设计的理由可能有“更讨喜观众”或者其他商业上的考虑……但对于那些只会想着“人死了就是悲剧！就是坏结局（Bad End）！”的人，恐怕《水仙》原本就不会是他们能理解的作品吧。


有关这点，本次负责电影化的导演则是纯粹地喜欢着《水仙》，对于何为《水仙》的“核心”也很能理解，我也十分放心。
哪怕有设定上的变更，只要“核心”不变的话就没问题。


反之，仅仅只有设定或者表面上的故事情节依循原作，结局却魔改成“病治好了！幸福结局！”的话可太糟糕了＞＜
如果不那么做就没法受观众欢迎、商业角度很难成功的话，那还不如别电影化了。


如果不那么做就很难找到赞助商的话，那还不如用更低的预算、花上更多的时间去“自由”地创作要来得更好。
而我自己也会竭尽全力协助的。


我想作为（权利）签约方的sekai project，也是能同意这种做法的。
毕竟对于过去我很少同意Nekoneko Soft作品动画化的理由，他们也是知情的。


简而言之，对于《水仙》电影化这件事，某种程度上还请大家放心！
作为原作者来说我信任着本次企划的导演，而事先做剧本监修的时候，要是有实在不行的内容我也会提出意见。


再说一个很现实的情况，这次电影化我自己是拿不到一分钱的w
但之所以仍然要做，既是作为原作者的自尊、也是为了尽到对喜欢本作的朋友们的义务。





お久しぶり、片岡ともです！
ナルキ映画化について、少し長いけど書いてみますね！
実は今までにも、日本とアメリカからも映画化のオファーがありました。
断った理由は幾つかありますが……
ラストシーンで「セツミの病気が治る」エンディングを希望されたのが大きいです。
ラストで海に入るシーンを、曖昧にするくらいならＯＫですが、
病気が治って良かった！な「安易なエンディング」は許容できません。
恐らく「観客ウケ」や商業的なことも考えた上でのことかも知れませんが……
そもそも人が死ぬ＝悲劇だ！　バッドエンドだ！としか思えない方に、
理解できるような作品なのでしょうか？　ナルキは？

それに対して今回の監督さんは、純粋にナルキ好きの方だと思っています。
何がナルキの「芯」であるか？を理解している方なら、自分は安心しています。
幾つかの変更点があったとしても「芯」がブレなければ。
逆に、設定・表層の出来事だけ原作通りだったとしても、
ラストで病気が治った！ハッピーエンド！とかダメすぎ＞＜
そうしないと観客ウケ・商業的に厳しいなら、映画化しない方が良い。
そうしないとスポンサーが付かないのなら、低予算で何年かかっても「自由」に作って貰える方がうれしいです。
自分も出来る限り協力しますし。
たぶん契約元のsekai projectさんも、それでＯＫと言うはずです。
自分がねこねこ作品のアニメ化も、滅多に許可しないことを、よくご存じですし。

そんなわけでナルキ映画化については、ある程度ご安心下さいませ！
自分としては監督を信頼していますし、
事前の脚本チェックでダメすぎる場合は、自分も意見すると思います。
あと、ぶっちゃけですが、映画化しても自分には１円もお金は入って来ませんよw
でもこれは作者としてのプライドと、作品を気に入ってくれた方への義務だと考えています。

                    <span>HELLO FRIENDS!! A portion of this video was premiered during the Streamys, so thank you so much to the Streamys for featuring us! You can check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zI64cM3sogg

Here is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I’ve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own — and though I’m not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??

Also, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron &amp; I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!

This video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea &amp; Megan for letting us film at your store!

We continue working on Matt’s Recovery Jeep this week as a 2nd Jeep arrives for us to disassemble and salvage parts for the Banana! We get the fenders, all 4 doors from the donor Jeep and grille all prepped. We get the hood braced with a new latch mechanism working. Last but not least we are able to remove the Banana&#x27;s roof panel while we prep the new one from the parts Jeep!  We have made a lot of progress and finally get all the parts primed!</span>

                    <span>How to make the disney.com landing page in under 90 minutes - part 1


Hello, and welcome to my awesome blog! 😊
This blog is part 1, of my under 90 min YouTube tutorial where I am going to show you how you can copy the disney.com landing page only using vanilla html and css. This project also focuses heavily on flexbox, so if you want to get some practice with that then this is the perfect tutorial!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6SUBhdvK31A 
In this first part, I&#x27;m showing you how to set up the html, and the styling for the mobile version of the website. In the second part I am going to show you how to make the page fully responsive and look good on desktop.
I have made a git repository that you can clone to follow along the tutorial (which I recommend)

https://github.com/SebCodesTheWeb/disneyclone
Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I&#x27;m a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since christmas brake finally arrived, I&#x27;ve decided to start a challenge for myself! I&#x27;m going to code for the coming 20 days.
I&#x27;m following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I&#x27;m currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch). I started this project to get some practice with css flexbox.
By the end of the 20 days I&#x27;m hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself and making tutorials on my 
YouTube-channel .
It would be awesome if you would follow along me on my journey and learn with me. You can follow my  blog  and subscribe to my  YouTube channel. And if you liked the YouTube video then it would really make my day if you left a comment or liked this post.

Keep Coding.</span>

                    <span>What is OSI?


OSI stands for Open System Interconnection, it’s a conceptual framework for how application communicate over a network. The purpose of the OSI model is to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software. OSI has a stack of seven layers within the model and the layers are used to help user identify what is happening within a networking system.
What is OSI layer?


The OSI layer are typically described from the top layer down. With the help of layering we decompose the problem of building a network into manageable components (layers), these layers help with modular design and easy troubleshooting. Going down and up the stack is called encapsulating and decapsulating respectfully. The layers are:

                    <span>The next iteration or feature I have implemented in my react theme is a view counter which shows the number of views each one of my posts is getting on my WordPress site. The number of views is a number value that is held against each post on my WordPress site using what is known as post meta. Post meta is a mechanism that WordPress provides that will let you store some additional data with each post and is normally set behind the scenes for you by custom PHP code running in either a theme or a plugin.
In my case I have set up a filter inside my functions.php file to increment a post views value by 1 each time a request is made to retrieve data for a specific post via the Rest API. The Rest API is a handy out of the box feature that WordPress provides that will let you access your pages an…</span>

                    <span>Overview


One of the important things in creating a REST API is the validation of data coming from the frontend. That is, whenever our APIs are subject to receiving data from the request body (for example) it is always good to ensure that we are receiving the necessary properties and that the data types are correct.
And in golang we have some libraries that help us with this purpose and in this article we are going to use the validator library, which besides being perhaps the most popular, is the one that contains a good number of resources for us to learn on the internet.
In today&#x27;s example we&#x27;ll create a simple API, but then we&#x27;ll proceed with implementing a middleware to validate the data before proceeding to the next handler.
First let&#x27;s install the following dependencies:

This is where Datasette comes in. Datasette is a great EDA (exploratory data analysis) tool for any arbitrary SQLite dataset. You can use it to build your own Twitter analytics!
Today, at Simon Willison&#x27;s prompting, I decided to try to replicate his 2018 work in analyzing his own Twitter network.

                    <span>In my previous post, I explained how you can mint an NFT using Solidity. But what if you don&#x27;t want to learn Solidity? 
Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that b*tch.
You want to stick with your ol&#x27; pal JavaScript. Let me tell you that there&#x27;s a way to do it. I present to you thirdweb - a library of smart contracts, SDK, and UI components that developers can use in their app.
How cool would it be if you could just call a mint function, give the token&#x27;s metadata as an argument, and it mints an NFT for you? All without writing a single line of Solidity code. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s possible.
The first thing you need to learn about is the concept of projects and modules. In short, projects are smart contracts that act as containers for your modules. On the other hand, modules are packages that contain sma…</span>

专注力是一个我很想在《少数派报告》里分享的话题。作为一名 ADHD 患者，我一直都饱受注意力缺失的困扰，尤其在近两年工作压力增大之后，我甚至已经察觉到自己出现了阅读障碍。
在研究和治疗 ADHD 的过程中，我也或主动或被动地了解和掌握了大量关于注意力的知识，并且积累了一些实践经验。当下，人类对于人脑的研究整体还处于较为初级的阶段，市面上关于注意力的图书和文献中的内容也或深或浅，各有说辞，没有绝对的定论。因此，在筹划本文的过程中，我的核心目标就是在尽可能不涉及专业术语和晦涩理论的前提下，清楚地将注意力的原理和概念阐释出来，带你以更简单的方式了解注意力的特点和由来。
在这篇《注意力使用不完全报告》中，我会从注意力的基本概念出发，最终延伸到有效提升专注力的办法，希望可以帮你在学习和工作中提升状态，提高效率，减少失误。
需要注意的是，文中的重点会集中在探讨注意力的底层原理，读起来可能会有些吃力。不要着急，放慢阅读速度。在理解了专注力从哪里来、到哪里去之后，相信你也能结合自身工作和学习环境，创造属于自己的专注力保持体系。
我们开始吧。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

当游船行驶到湖中，很容易就会想起梭罗在《瓦尔登湖》里写下的那句「天空跃于头顶，而又俯于足下」。
阳澄湖
若换成更具本土特色的说法，那就是「落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色」。
所剩无几的江南水乡
阳澄湖的一潭湖水上承自古太湖水系的支脉，在江南风景里已涌动了数千年。湖水清澈，碧波荡漾。大闸蟹是这里享誉天下的特产，初秋季节的头等珍馐佳肴。每年金九银十，浩浩荡荡的顺丰冷链车就从上海和苏州市区驶来，驶过美人腿、莲花岛半岛，将蟹农们饲养一年的宝贝收集装箱，发往全国各地。肥美的蟹挥舞着蟹钳落入滚烫的蒸锅沸水里，捞起时飘香在空中的已是满屋蟹黄蟹膏的味道。
名满天下的阳澄湖大闸蟹
但可惜的是，世人只知名誉在外的大闸蟹，却忽视了阳澄湖本身的美。《沙家浜》有汪曾祺的名句：「朝霞映在阳澄湖上，芦花放稻谷香岸柳成行」。如今从阳澄湖上向四围望去，除了比人高的芦荡、临湖而立的大树，此岸与彼岸的土地上也多出了连绵成片的城市楼宇，苏州市区和昆山在这里拱湖相望。疏影横斜间，留下的是城市化进程中所剩无几的江南水乡。
现代水乡
本期游记，是我数次往返阳澄湖后的经验总结，希望能向你展示出一篇详尽的吃蟹指南，以及一幅不仅限于大闸蟹的阳澄湖的样貌。当然，作为一个没有那么标准化商业化的景点，阳澄湖并没有标准游玩路线，更不需要按点打卡。一个简单的周末，肆意地漫游，便是最适合阳澄湖的打开方式，也是我最推崇的旅行心态。散步在稻谷田野里，心情便像宁静的湖水一样，在日光云影下缓缓舒展开来。

                    <span>Watch the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope—the most powerful space telescope ever made. This mission is scheduled to lift off at 7:20 a.m. EST (12:20 UTC), Dec. 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.

With revolutionary technology, Webb will observe a part of space and time never seen before, providing a wealth of amazing views into an era when the very first stars and galaxies formed––over 13.5 billion years ago.

It can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and study the atmospheres of distant worlds. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more! It’s the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built.

Webb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make Webb a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries!

                    <span>Watch The Duchess of Cambridge and Tom Walker perform &#x27;For Those Who Can&#x27;t Be Here&#x27; at Westminster Abbey for Royal Carols: Together At Christmas.

The performance took place in The Chapter House inside Westminster Abbey in December 2021. The song was played as part of the Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, a carol service that reflected upon the difficult past 18 months for people across our nation, and particularly for those who might be more vulnerable, isolated or have limited access to support.

#TogetherAtChristmas was a moment to recognise those who have struggled during the pandemic, as well as to celebrate the individuals and organisations who carried out inspirational acts of kindness and incredible feats to help those in need in our communities.

                    <span>Building an application can be hard depending on how you do it, as our career passes and the knowledge we get, more information and good practices we use for creating and improving the software we maintain.
Some good practices are in SOLID Principles, a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
Is good to be clear, SOLID has been created with Object-Oriented Programming in mind, so we are adapting to Elixir, a functional programming language, we are going to see that the benefits do not depend on the programming paradigm.

To explain better how we use the solid principles on elixir, I am gonna create a module and for each principle, we refactor it, the module is called Animals and is responsible to create …</span>

                    <span>As we know, there are no conditional statements in CSS, but this may soon change with new @when and @else operator
Currently, the only way to perform a conditional statement was to use media queries like this:
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  /* ... */ 
}
@media (max-width: 599px) {
  /* ... */
}

It works perfectly, but in the new proposal it looks much cleaner and very similar to many programming languages.
@when media(min-width: 600px) {
  /* ... */ 
}
@else {
  /* ... */ 
}

We can do multiple conditions as well by using multiple @else statements, and not just use @media, but @supports too.
@when media(width &gt;&#x3D; 600px) and media(pointer: fine) and supports(display: grid) {
  /* A */
} @else supports(caret-color: red) and supports(background: double-rainbow()) {
  /* B */
} @else {
  /* C */
}

There may be questions about the naming of this new feature. Some people think that @if would be a better name than @when, the reason behind this naming is probably that Sass already uses @if, and it would be annoying to many developers if they had to refactor their Sass logic.
The bad news is that it&#x27;s not supported by any browser at this moment, it&#x27;s not even listed on caniuse.com.
What do you think about this new proposal?</span>

                    <span>I did a lot of C and C++ early in my career.  Among other thing, I worked on an RPG named &quot;Mantra&quot; with my high-school friends.  I still have the source code, and looking back on it, I&#x27;m pretty impressed: good comments, nice structure, and even tests.  I&#x27;m not sure the code I wrote today is 25 years better!
Pointers are used all over in C and C++, and a critical part of using them safely is to understand how long a pointer will be valid.  Getting this wrong results in use-after-free bugs or memory leaks, both of which plague C/C++ programs.
C++ offers some tools to do this kind of thing automatically -- smart pointers, RAII, and so on.  But in C, the language is generally no help, and it&#x27;s up to the programmer to understand the situation.  This is generally handled with long, explicit comm…</span>

                    <span>Logo is a programming language all the way from the 1960s aimed at teaching kids programming. The most notable feature of Logo are &quot;turtle graphics&quot; - simple commands that draw lines on screen by moving an imaginary &quot;turtle&quot;.
One issue with covering Logo is that it&#x27;s meant for interactive use in some Logo GUI environment, and these are platform specific and don&#x27;t last very long, so every variant of Logo will be quite different. And it&#x27;s not just their fancy features like 3D graphics, interactivity, and so on. Even very basic commands like like changing color are going to be different in each Logo.
I&#x27;ll be using in-browser papert Logo, so all examples will work in papers. Different Logo implementations will need some adjustments. I&#x27;ll try to mention when something is implementation-specific…</span>

They are offering 3 crucial services free for their users. Now you can add unlimited sites, unlimited bandwidths and unlimited request for free. You don&#x27;t have to pay a dime, even if you are receiving a huge number of page views in your site daily.
The offer is very lucrative. Isn&#x27;t it ? So to test this out, In this tutorial we are going to deploy a Next.js website in Cloudflare pages.
Now the question is why Next.js not a simple create-react-app website ? This is because, Next.js is the most popular framework among JAMstack developers.

It is the current trending topic in IT domain as this vulnerability made millions of sites vulnerable to RCE(Remote Code Execution). Lets try to understand what is Log4j and what vulnerability is exploited to gain RCE.
Log4J is a Java-based open source component maintained by the Apache Foundation that is commonly incorporated into Java applications. It allows to record traceability of operations at a functional and operational level in a multitude of services, even from a security point of view. So basically it is a library used for logging(maintaining a record of events occurred in a application) in applications.

                    <span>Sometime in JavaScript we need a function that executes only once and never again. Basically a function that disappears right after its called once. How can we achieve this? for example we could do this:
const func1 &#x3D; function(){
             console.log(&#x27;this function will never run again!&#x60;)
                }
 func1();

But we definitely can call this func1() again if we want. This is NOT what we want to do. We want to execute a function immediately without having to save it somewhere.
function(){
console.log(&#x27;This function will never run again&#x27;)
}

if we run this, we would get an error function statements require a function name an that&#x27;s because JavaScript expects a function statement, but we simply start a new line of code with the function keyword.
Here we can still trick JavaScript into thinking that this is just an expression. We do that by simply wrapping all of this into GROUPING OPERATOR().
(function(){
   console.log(&#x27;This is will never run again!&#x27;)
});

so we basically transform the previous statement into an expression. But the function didn&#x27;t execute yet. To execute the function we need to call it like this (adding &#x27;()&#x27; next to it, like we do with regular function call).
(function(){
   console.log(&#x27;This is will never run again!&#x27;)
})();

So we create a function expression and we immediately call it. which is why this pattern is called Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE).
The same would also work for an arrow function this way.
(() &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;This function will never run again!&#x27;))();

This will also never run again.
so this is not really a feature, of the JavaScript.
it&#x27;s more of a pattern, that some developers come up with and it is widely used.
This design pattern is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.
Self-Executing -&gt; it executes the moment it is created.

@Kostya：Nanoleaf Essentials 灯带

购买渠道：Apple Store 在线商店
价格：338 元 （近期 Nanoleaf 天猫期舰店的价格比较好）

目前在 Apple Store 在线商店的 HomeKit 配件，可谓是少之又少。本来，HomeKit 配件就以高价格让人望而却步，加上大部分智能家居配件又只能工作在 2.4GHz 的 Wi-Fi 网络下，我一直都对智能家居有那么一些抗拒。只不过，最近正好一个人搬到了出租屋，公寓里面的照明不仅单调，而且开关也比较死板，就种草了 Nanoleaf 的 Shapes 六角灯和 Essentials 灯带。正值年末，我也狠下心来，买了这两款灯具。上一篇「新玩意」，我已经介绍了 Nanoleaf Shapes 六角灯奇光板，这篇就来说说 Essentials 灯带吧。

自从搬进了出租屋，夜间的照明问题其实一直困扰着我。靠近床的那个灯开关离床还是有那么一点远，每次我都要伸长手过去够不说，如今我用上了一分二的插座转换器，这个开关被彻底挡住了。除此之外，这个灯真的很亮，如果是晚上突然打开，我总是会被突然增加到 max 的亮度闪到；就算是开灯阅读或者是玩手机，白色的灯本身也过于寒冷。所以，我一直想买一款能够融入环境，同时亮度也足够的夜间照明用灯。
Nanoleaf Essentials 灯带默认提供 2m 的长度，自带双面胶可以粘贴在光滑的表面，因此我买来之后就贴在了床头。如果日后需要，还可以接续。不过，目前的效果是，灯亮起来…</span>

                    <span>我曾经在少数派写过不少关于将米家接入 HomeKit 的教程，尽管方法和步骤越来越简单，但无一例外都需要通过代码来进行操作。这对于有编程基础的朋友来说不难，但对大部分不懂代码的人来说就有较高的门槛。一个明显的案例是，每当我发表完一篇教程后，私信里都是各种求助，希望我能够帮他们看看到底是因为什么原因导致的代码报错。
随着智能家居平台和协议的日渐成熟，终于在如今，米家和 HomeKit 之间的互通迎来了一个新的维度：我们已经完全可以在图形化的界面下，来实现过去这些繁琐的操作。在这个过程中，你不会接触到任何一条代码或脚本，只需要用鼠标轻点，就能完全绝大部分的工作。

从 HomeBridge 到 Home Assistant
在过去，我选择将米家接入 HomeKit 的方案一直是 HomeBridge。但这一次我们则要舍弃它，转投到 Home Assistant 的怀抱中。关于二者的原理和差别，这里就不展开细说，主要来了解一下，为什么要转投到一个新的平台上。
首先，Home Assistant 丰富的开发者和生态环境，是这次能够实现无代码操作的根本。虽然如今 HomeBridge 也在往无代码操作的方向努力，但由于不少旧插件作者已经不再更新，自然就不会再支持图形化编辑。所以，选择 HomeBridge 大都还是无法摆脱写 config.json 文件的命运 —— 而这正好是新手最容易出错的地方。
标有 Verified 的就是可以图形化操作的插件，但是一些老旧的插件就无法使用了
其次是 Home Assistant 更加丰富的接入类型。如果是用 HomeBridge，则每个设备必须要有一个对应的插件，否则便无法接入。例如米家后续推出的一些基于蓝牙 Mesh 网络产品，HomeBridge 完全没辙，至今都找不到对应的插件。但 Home Assistant 属于来者不拒，无论是 Z…</span>

Letra:
[Verso 1]
Yo sé que soy un c@brón
Que no merezco tu perdón
Te juro que no e&#x27; mi intención
Pero si escucha&#x27; esta canción

[Coro]
Te deseo lo mejor
Ojalá que te olvides de mí-í-í-í-í
Yo sé que fui lo peor
Y tú mereces ser feli&#x27;-i&#x27;-i&#x27;-i&#x27;
Me voy antes de que sea tarde
Y el corazón te destroce otra ve&#x27;
Ya sé que soy un cobarde
Si quiere&#x27; haz quе no me conoce&#x27;, está biеn

[Verso 2]
Otra ve&#x27; no cumplí lo que te prometí
Otra ve&#x27; te fallé, otra ve&#x27; te mentí, eh-eh
Otra ve&#x27; me toca ser el malo
¿De qué valen la&#x27; flore&#x27; y lo&#x27; regalo&#x27;?
Si soy culpable de tu dolor
Y por mí ahora ere&#x27; peor
No quiere&#x27; que más nadie te hable de amor
Pero yo—

[Coro]
Te deseo lo mejor
Ojalá que te olvides de mí-í-í-í-í
Yo sé que fui lo peor
Y tú mereces ser feli&#x27;-i&#x27;-i&#x27;-i&#x27;
Me voy ante&#x27; de que sea tarde
Y el corazón te destroce otra ve&#x27;
Ya sé que soy un cobarde
Si quiere&#x27; haz que no me conoce&#x27;, está bien, eh

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto” tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Celebrate with Miranda, Beatriz and the rest of the “Encanto” family streaming now on Disney+.

                    <span>In this article, we will learn how to change the Build path of a React application. Here I&#x27;m using a shell script for moving the contents inside the build folder to another location. 
Create a {file-name}.sh file inside the root directory of your react app. 


Open to your package.json file.


Just beneath the build script, add a new one called &quot;postbuild&quot; with a value &quot;./{file-name}.sh&quot;.




if you are using Windows, use bash before executing the script.

This shell script is executed right after the build process, and the actual magic happens inside the shell script.
#If the folder exists, remove it first, then copy the files
if [ -d &quot;./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/&quot; ]; then

    rm -rv ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/*
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/

#Else make a new folder and then move the files.
else
    mkdir -p ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/
fi


In my case, I just wanted to move the build folder contents to my server folder.
This script can be customized to your need. Just go through some simple shell-script tutorials. Here what is helping us is the &#x27;postbuild&#x27; script that will be automatically executed after the build command.

  What is Dev-Sec-Ops?


DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It&#x27;s an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.
It is a endless field. Here we only focus about Infra and DevOps level security. We will discuss on both OSS and Paid tools which we can implement on CICD pipeline to make secure.
The Centre for Internet Security (CIS) provides a standardized set of security benchmarks to identify and refine effective security measures for specific set of tools and technologies.

It provides security benchmark and the National Checklist Program (NCP), defined by the NIST

We&#x27;ll start from the installation of Python and cover mathematical operations, strings, user input, string operations, variables, and In place operators.
If you don&#x27;t know, this blog post and all other future posts in the Python series are part of  this Udemy course. Do check it out.
Before starting if you don&#x27;t have Python installed on your computer, install the latest version of Python 3 from their website and a corresponding IDE to code which we&#x27;ll use for writing big programs, you can either go with VS Code or Pycharm.
We&#x27;ll start with the basic Hello World program. So open your Python console and follow the article -

                    <span>A while back ⁣I decided that I wanted to automate the flow of blog posts to my email list (which is basically nobody right now by the way 😅).
I found that Mailchimp has a feature for automatically sending to an email list based on RSS feed updates on a website.
A RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized way.
RSS feeds are usually generated for you in website builders and other tools but since my site was built from scratch I needed to make my own.
Here is what I needed to do:





That was a fun, quick project to work on for a few hours and saved me an exponential amount of time in the future. 💪🏾

                    <span>Introduction


In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll be building a login authentication using React and FastApi. This will help show how we can use both packages for a login authentication process but before that, let&#x27;s take at React and also what FastApi is.
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous actions, as well as data validation, authentication, and interactive API documentation, all of which are powered by OpenAPI. It comes with exciting features like:
React is a user interface development library. It can construct full-stack apps by talking with a server/API and operates as an SPA (single page app) on the client. Because it is competent and directly equivalent to frameworks like Angular or Vue, React …</span>

                    <span>Today we will cover another important structural directive provided by the Angular Team - ngFor
ngFor
Lets see that in practice-
structural-directive-demo.component.ts file and add the below code -
itemsToBuy &#x3D; [&#x27;Pencil&#x27;, &#x27;Notebook&#x27;, &#x27;School bag&#x27;, &#x27;Eraser&#x27;];

and in component template file add the below code -

  {{ item }}


Now if you start the application and open localhost:4200 in the browser you would see the below output -

*ngFor&#x3D;&quot;let item of itemsToBuy&quot; 
&#x3D; operator.
itemsToBuy is the array we declared in the component TS file. We use the for-of syntax to loop through the array. Every item in the array is assigned to the variable item which is then printed in between div tag by using the {{item}}. The loop is auto incremented and moves to the next item until all the items are printed.
item variable holds a string value.
list of objects. 
A word of Caution
For example ngIf and ngFor at the same div element is not allowed.
That&#x27;s all about ngFor. Hope you enjoyed the post.
Cheers!!!

How is it that a little over 35000 java packages, amounting to 8% of the Maven Central Repository has been impacted due to the log4shell vulnerability. How is it that a vulnerability in a logging library could result in a CVSS score of 10[the highest it can go is 10]. This classic java logging library hitting mainstream feels so odd. Two different worlds that shouldn&#x27;t be meeting.
In this blog, let&#x27;s understand what is log4j and what exactly is this log4shell vulnerability and why it happened? 

What is log4j?


Apache Log4j is one of the most utilized logging library in the Java ecosystem. If you ever worked within a Java application, you&#x27;ve probably seen log4j in action. Log4j along with the basic log…</span>

                    <span>You may wonder who I am after reading the title. I’m a 16 year old who is in high school, with the dream of becoming a quant developer. This is my dream as I know this role comes with many flexible tasks, it uses math &amp; finance which I find very interesting and where I can, apply my coding skills. 
I have been developing computer programs since I was 11 years old. The first programming language I learned was html if you even dare to call it one. Quickly after this, I learned JavaScript, Python and then C. Python is by far my favourite programming language, since it’s easy to use, clear and has many powerful libraries. 
I started to make my own programs and discovered that I could use Python libraries to speed up development. From this, I learned about open-source projects which helped me a…</span>

                    <span>Install Linux Mint
Undoubtedly, Linux Mint is one of the best Linux distributions for beginners. It is easy to use, does not consume much system resources and has a lot of software available.
There are three different ways we can install Linux Mint. Linux Mint installation methods are:
Install Linux Mint in VirtualBox on Windows like a regular desktop application.
We are using the Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon edition. However, the steps work for installing other versions of Mint and desktop types such as Xfce and MATE. The screenshot taken from the Linux Mint installation steps may look a little different, but the steps are the same.
A USB with a capacity of at least 4 GB. You can also use a DVD.
Minimum system requirements for Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon default version:

本周话题：下一个内卷的行业
一年多以前，周刊讨论过，&quot;内卷&quot;这个词到底是什么意思？
当时的结论是，内卷的原义是&quot;向内发展&quot;，因为向外发展受到了阻碍，就开始向内部要效益。结果往往是恶性竞争，因为 蛋糕做不大了，大家只能争夺对方的份额。

一年过去了，内卷已经成了常见词。
很多行业早就出现了内卷，比如培训业、电商、视频、直播等等。这样的行业，都有一个共同点：市场没有扩张，利润没有增长，但是从业人员却越来越忙、越来越累，业务开展越来越难。
下一个内卷的行业，会是谁？
我也不卖关子，直接说吧，很可能是游戏业。

你可能不相信这个结论：游戏业非常赚钱，而且一直在高速增长，怎么会内卷呢？
我本来也不相信，但是上周发布的《2021年中国游戏产业报告》，公布了中国游戏市场的两个增长率：
销售收入增长 6.40%，达到2965亿。
游戏用户增长 0.22%，达到6.66亿。

这两个增长率都非常低。
销售收入虽然增长6.4%，但如果考虑到游戏业的投入，每年都在增加，就意味着，今年的行业利润没有增长，可能还有下跌。
更要命的是，用户总数只增长了0.22%。这是有史以来最低的增长率，以前每年游戏人口都要增长几千万，今年只增长了100多万，接近零增长了。

这就是说，国内的游戏用户可能已经到天花板了，市场饱和了。玩游戏的人口大概就是这个数量了，国内的游戏市场以后就没有增量用户了。
虽然游戏行业还是会成长，因为每个用户的游戏支出会增加。但是，一个行业…</span>

[电影] 雄狮少年

关键词：动画 / 喜剧 / 剧情
片长：104 分钟
观看渠道：院线上映中；豆瓣链接

终于有一部题材特别的国产动画了。

@一只索狗：第一次看到预告片的时候就关注到这部作品，主要是因为它特别的题材背景，是我们的传统文化舞狮，我也在心里默默感叹：「终于有人拍些除了西游、古代神话故事之外的题材了。」
剧情讲述了留守少年阿娟和好友阿猫、阿狗在退役狮王咸鱼强的培训下参加舞狮比赛，最终「咸鱼翻身」的故事，主旨就是追逐梦想和生活现实的矛盾冲突。努力、热血、感动这些剧情关键词听起来有些套路，但本片处理方式得当…</span>

                    <span>双旦将至，身边的朋友陆陆续续开始讨论起「该送什么礼物给家人 / 伴侣 / 朋友 / 宠物...」，而正当我为挑选礼物苦恼的时候，编辑 Tp 给我发了这篇选题，也为我提供了全新的送礼思路。
此前我对于乐高的印象，只有「购买套装回来自己拼」，以及它的英文名 LEGO 是来自于丹麦语「LEg GOdt」，意为「Play Well」，玩得开心。
而在仔细逛完坐落在广州正佳广场，全球最大的乐高品牌旗舰店之后，我不仅拥有了属于自己的「定制小人仔」，还发现了「自选拼搭颗粒」「马赛克像素画定制」等独特的玩法。在这篇文章中，我将以广州正佳广场的旗舰店为例，来聊聊我们逛乐高旗舰店时，除了买套装，我们还可以留意的东西，希望能为你的双旦礼物挑选补充一个有趣的选择～

定制小人仔
哪个乐高玩家不想拥有一个专属于自己的定制人仔呢？前段时间 Tp 在 新玩意 分享了自己定制的乐高人仔，身在广州的我，自然也不会错过可以在家门口定制人仔的机会。于是在和 Tp 约稿之后，我也终于拥有了一个独一无二的乐高人仔。

定制人仔的步骤很简单，主要有以下几步：
购买

在收银台购买乐高小人仔工厂套装。

以广州乐高旗舰店为例，想要定制一个属于自己的人仔，首先要到收银台购买一个乐高小人仔工厂套装，定价是 99 元 / 个。完成付款之后，工作人员会递给自己一个包装盒，拿着包装盒到定制台进行扫描就可以开始定制啦。如果你去的时候人比较多，可能需要先跟工作人员签到排号，并且可能会限制你的定制时间。

个性化定制

在小人仔工厂机器上扫描套装，输入你的姓名，开始设计吧。

将购买好的包装盒放在定制台上，屏幕会出现「输入你的姓名」的提示，系统内置中文输入法并支持中文混排。输入好名字之后会打印在一个 1x3 的砖块上，可以作为小人仔的站台。

开始定制之后，我们可以对小人仔上装的正反面进行设计，而头部、裤部…</span>

享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

享乐
推荐好的游戏音乐，希望更多人因为音乐对游戏产生兴趣（我就是）。

                    <span>这是少数派与国民好物 aigo 联合推出的信息储存设备的科普系列文章。作为国内早期的存储设备制造商及佼佼者，感谢 aigo 对本文提供的一系列支持，包括但不限于技术知识指导、市场难寻的老物件以及作者用于拆解介绍的最新产品等。
我们希望通过最简洁通俗的描述，带领大家了解信息储存设备的基本原理，知道那些复杂的参数，如何挑选购买适合自己的存储设备，又是如何更好地使用，更安全稳定地保存我们的数据，以及未来我们能够用上什么技术。 另本系列虽然与 aigo 联合发起，但所有内容不涉及任何品牌指导或要求的商业营销。

上一章我们了解到了另一种特殊的储存介质，运行内存的方方面面，本章我们就继续来介绍除了机械硬盘和固态硬盘外，我们常用的一些储存设备，包括 U 盘、内存卡、移动硬盘和手机储存芯片。它们都是使用 NAND 颗粒来储存数据，并且有着相同的工作结构，不过形态和实际性能却截然不同。
U 盘的结构原理和常见参数
说完运行内存，接下来再说一个大家更加熟悉的东西 —— U 盘（很多人也叫它优盘）。从学生时代开始，这玩意儿估计是大部分人必备的一个东西，带着我们重要的文档（或许还有病毒~），流连在各个电脑的 USB 接口之间。比如底下这个超经典的金士顿 U 盘，应该都曾经拥有或者见过别人用这个吧：
经典的红色透明金士顿 Kingston U 盘，型号是 DT101G2
如果你年纪比较小，那经典的 U 盘应该换成这个：
新经典金属外壳金士顿 Kingston U 盘，型号是 DTSE9/DTSE9G2
也许现在大部分人用的还是好几年前的 U 盘，但其实除了我们印象中的那些经典 U 盘，现在的 U 盘已经发展得更加成熟，稳定性和速度都有了很大提升，还出现了新的品类。接下来我就给大家详细介绍一下 U 盘的结构原理和一些我们需要了解的参数。

                    <span>​年关将至，如果说回头看这一年联盟出现了什么变化，或许现在高居东部第五的骑士队会是个值得关注的惊喜。
虽然这么说有点马后炮，但这支球队自小比克斯塔夫接手之后就隐隐约约给人一种将要崛起的气质。
人们总喜欢从成功的结果往前倒推复盘，然后总结出各种各样的理由，但最后得出的结论往往既没有参考性也没有可复制性，因为球队的发展不是加减乘除的方程式，每一个做出影响的因素都不是固定的常量，变量太多的事情你怎么复制？
给骑士的成功总结原因其实没多大意思，比起事后吹捧他们怎样慧眼识珠凑到这套阵容，不如讨论一下他们现在到底强在哪里？
从数据上看，新赛季骑士最好的环节是防守：目前他们每百回合只丢103.5分，这个数字排在联盟第3，仅次于勇士和太阳两支胜率在80%以上的独一档球队。



而骑士防守出彩很大程度上与他们的三高体系有关。有趣的是，由于活塞曾经有不堪入目的三高失败案例，“德拉蒙德+约什-史密斯+门罗”攻不能守不行，所以骑士实施三高体系的初期并不被球迷看好。
这也很难说是球迷没有眼光，因为把阿伦+莫布里+马尔卡宁的组合冠以“三高“的标签存在一定的误导性。
虽然他们的身高都超过2米11，但良好的机动性使得他们不能与普通的内线的球员混为一谈。
实质上，骑士”三高“内核里藏着的是“小球”，三高确实是高，但他们却具备“小球时代”最强调的核心竞争力——防守的伸缩性。
阿伦谈到骑士的长人体系这样说：“也许球风回到2001年不是坏事”，但骑士看似古早的篮球哲学只是表象，踩准现代篮球获益点才是他们真正做成的事情。
尤其是阿伦作为三高体系的代言人，他或许是这个“反差萌”的最佳代表。为什么这么说？因为莫布里和马尔卡宁虽然都是7尺长人，但他们本身就在4-5号位摇摆，甚至能漂移到3号位的现代独角兽。而阿伦属于典型的传统护框型内线，但传统的外衣下却是反差极大的，适应小球时代的可塑性。

by 乌合之子但愿君
☆本文包括对大量影视、动画作品的反派的剧透，请谨慎阅读。☆
反派死于话多，其实还有两句话，一句是主角胜于嘴炮，一句是主角死于不补刀。但是本文是讲反派的，所以关于主角的故事，等下次有机会我们再分析吧。
反派为什么死于话多呢？这句话到底是怎么来的呢？
本着打破砂锅问到底的精神，我进行了一番仔细的考证，发现了一个记入影视评论书的来源。美国影评达人罗杰·伊伯特（Roger Ebert）的书《我知道你们又来这一套》里收录了这个词条。

全文如下：
Fallacy of the Talking Killer。
The villain wants to kill the hero. He has him cornered at gunpoint. All he has to do is pull the trigger. But he always talks first. He explains the hero&#x27;s mistakes to him. Jeers. Laughs. And gives the hero time to think his way out of the situation, or be rescued by his buddy. Cf. most James Bond movies.[1]
反派死于话多之误。反派一直梦想杀掉主角。他已经用枪把主角逼到了墙角，只需轻轻一扣扳机就大功告成了；但他开始详细地阐述主角所犯的错误，然后嘲讽一番、冷笑几声。而所有这些嘴炮存在的意义就是为了让主角有充足的时间思考该如何逃生，或者成功地被同伴解救。007系列电影中的詹姆斯·邦德先生就是这种现象的受益者。
这本书里还收录了很多奇奇怪的词条，比如：

                    <span>你好，我是射手夸夸。
如果你想在游戏中掌控局势，那么请与我一起让更多ADC成为ADC吧。
笔者曾用烬（场数占比70%+）打上艾欧尼亚最强王者段位，也常使用烬上分。本篇为戏命师·烬的英雄攻略文章，其中内容涵盖英雄优劣势分析、版本解读、符文与装备选择、技能理解与分析、打法技巧以及对线不同ADC的一些经验。
烬在国服较为冷门，即便他往往能成为赛场中的宠儿、版本里的顶流。我相信烬能受到召唤师们的喜爱，于是我在去年8月份，通过图文、视频的形式，较为完整地创作了烬的英雄攻略，或许有朋友已在之前看过，不过不必担心，这篇文章在许多地方有了优化更新，也增添了一些内容。
射手夸夸：戏命师·烬！万字攻略教你玩好“艺术家”
相信会有更多人喜欢烬，也相信大家都能成为一名高手烬。
（此为11.2-11.3版本所作，而现在3月4日版本已更新，故有些地方与当下有别，除版本外不影响阅读，之后版本更新对烬有较大影响时，会将文字优化更新）
英雄优劣、版本、符文与装备

烬于2016年2月18日登场，成为召唤师峡谷的第129名英雄，登场第一年就拥有了冠军皮肤，SKT-T1-烬。
之前有朋友问我喜欢用哪个皮肤，哪个皮肤手感好，我个人推荐暗星尊，至于之后的新皮肤就需要用过才知道了。

许多玩家对他有一个身体上的误解，他其实不是瘸子，走路一瘸一拐是因为他把武器拆分放在身上，武器太重所以导致走路姿态异常，在开大的时候就会掏出并进行组装。
官方也说过烬是个健全的人，机械那半边只是护臂，是减轻枪后坐力用的，肩膀上突出来的一块是武器组件。当然一些玩家也已习惯称呼烬为瘸子了，我想他这个用枪当作画笔的艺术家不会在意。

我于杀戮之中盛放，一如黎明中的花朵。烬的魅力不仅源于台词和沈磊老师的配音，同时烬的名称戏命师以及各个技能和效果的名称也非常酷。

                    <span>No framework Vue, na sua atual versão 3, é possível utilizar a API de composição do Vue (Composition API) para lidar com possíveis cenários de repetição de código. 
Agora o Vue conta com funcionalidades importadas do framework, para ser utilizado somente aquilo que será necessário. A abordagem é um pouco parecida com os &quot;react hooks&quot; para quem vem do mundo do React.js.
Aqui vai um exemplo:
global.js
   import { reactive } from &#x27;vue&#x27;;

   const state &#x3D; reactive({ count: 0 })

   const incrementCount &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; state.count++;

   export default { state, incrementCount };

No código acima é importada uma função que vai lidar com a reatividade do objeto, que é passado como argumento contento o atributo &quot;count&quot;. Dessa forma qualquer alteração no atributo &quot;count&quot; será reativo, ou seja, qualquer lug…</span>

My only experience before this course was the FCC HTML course and a part of the JS course, so I knew already some of the things that were shown, but it was still a good training and also taught many things I didn&#x27;t knew.
All in all I can recommend this course.</span>

                    <span>Today we will continue our journey in understanding the other built in Angular directives mainly the Structural Directives.
structural directives. 
The first directive which we will understand is the ngIf directive.
The structural directives always starts with an asterisk * 
*ngIf
A point to note
The element is completely removed from the DOM if the condition executes to false. It will not occupy any space in the DOM.
Now lets see in practice-
structural-directive-demo.
post.

To be precise add the variable myAge and assign the value 18 to it.
export class StructuralDirectiveDemoComponent implements OnInit {

  myAge &#x3D; 18;

  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit(): void { }
}

Now open the corresponding html template file and paste in the below code-
&#x3D; 18&quot;&gt;I am an Adult!
I am a CHILD
&#x3D; 18&quot;&gt;I am an Adult!
&#x3D; 18 returns true which is assigned to the directive ngIf. Since true is assigned to the directive ngIf the p tag is visible.
myAge variable value to say 17 so that the above condition is false but the second line of code 
I am a CHILD
 returns true.
Now if you open the browser you will see that the output changes.
p tag is not shown/ hidden while the second p tag is shown which was hidden when the model value was 18.

  checkAge() {
    if (this.myAge &gt;&#x3D; 18) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

and in html template file you can call the function inside ngIf like below -
I am an Adult!

Note
Any values like false, null, undefined, empty string when assigned to ngIf will result in hiding the element.
Hope you enjoyed the post.
Cheers!!!
Happy Coding</span>

In this blog i will tell you how to add react-gtm-module in your PWA Studio storefront project. So there are some steps which need to be followed.
Your must have a storefront project in pwa studio. You can also create a new one by using command yarn create @magento/pwa or npm init @magento/pwa. 
You must install Fooman VeniaUiOverrideResolver for PWA Studio either by using yarn add @fooman/venia-ui-override-resolver or by using npm i @fooman/venia-ui-override-resolver. The main reason behind installing Fooman extension is we need to override a component file where we will add our gtm module.

It&#x27;s no secret that the job market is competitive. You need to stand out from the crowd in order to get noticed and nab an interview. But what if you&#x27;re struggling with where to start? What should you do? The answer lies in your side hustle!
A side hustle, or &quot;hustle&quot; for short, is any project or venture you take on outside of your day job (or night job) that provides supplemental income. It could be something as simple as making candles at home; it could also be a full-time business like running a bakery.
Hustling is the act of making money outside of your 9-5 job or business. Side hustles are usually small ventures that provide supplemental income, but they can also turn into full-time gigs

React.Js is an open-source JavaScript UI library for building user interfaces. Nowadays React is the most popular for frontend design. It’s especially used to building single-page applications. You can create large applications in React that can transform data without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is fast, scalable, and simple. Literally, React has the ability to use several clever technics to minimize costly DOM operations required to update the UI. But for some large applications, you need to optimize your React application performance. There are several ways to speed up your React applications, let’s learn about them -

Knowledge is power! 
Knowing what events have taken place in your Netlify project, and being able to trigger actions based on those events, is pretty bloomin’ powerful too!
Netlify creates a variety of events throughout the lifecycle of your site deployments and for other services we provide for your sites, such as form submissions. Each of these events can create notifications and trigger actions elsewhere.
Combining tools and services using events and triggers opens up all kinds of fun possibilities for your projects!

                    <span>How to UI?


Art of UI creation is so common I guess. Many people ignore the part of UI planning and directly hopes into HTML and CSS. What is fascinating is that planning and creating a design template is better as it allows you to check which font and colors suit your website and style, because it&#x27;s not easy to change theme of whole website once it&#x27;s somewhat or maybe completely built as compare to UI creation tools.

Using such tools like FIGMA and Adobe XD allows us to quickly do those changes and finalize the design, all then is left to implement them in real-time website.
*1. Icons *
https://www.flaticon.com/ that I personally use when it comes to icons and small vectors to aid website looks.

2. Theme and colors
https://flatuicolors.com/ as it provides best colors and combos that are so perfect when actually implemented. It&#x27;s easy and free to use :)

3. Images
https://unsplash.com/ although you might already know about it. But something that you might not be knowing is that they also provide users with an API that provide aesthetic images by artists for you to implement in your source code.

4. Fonts. YES! please
https://fonts.google.com/ or https://fontawesome.com/ (font awesome provides icons as well).

Hope all this was useful to you and I hope you&#x27;ll apply these in your projects so they would look even more attractive.

There is so much out there. It can be paralyzing. I already used a variety of frontend frameworks: React (CRA, Gatsby, NextJS), Vue, Angular, Svelte (SvelteKit).

@北鸮：Paperwill 2022 纸志地球模型台历

购买渠道：天猫
入手价格：168 元

2022 年眼看就到了，最近几天一直盘算着买个日历。原本是想整个台历，记点儿每天的什么重大事件的，后来想想好像有手机有手帐，我也没什么再整个记事台历的必要，于是就奔着桌面摆件的方向去找。原本是相中了即刻出的那款「今天是周五吗」，但当我看到的时候，它就早早卖空了。
本着达成「桌面摆件」和「每天撕一页的仪式感」两个原则，我最终入手了这款 Paperwill 出产的「纸志地球」。

就我的理解，本质上这应该是借鉴日本 TRIAD Inc. 几年前大火的 OMOSHIROI BLOCK 纸雕便签系列。当时那款纸雕便签从边缘一层层揭下逐渐露出京都清水寺的设计让人眼前一亮。稍有差别的是纸志地球由于纸雕最终成球形，是以中心为轴，日历纸做成三角，旋转排布，逐渐露出地球的纸雕。

这个日历还配备一个亚克力罩子，撕完扣上可以直接当成展示盒。扯下来的纸张其实也可以当成小便签贴在显示器下面。很显然，它唯一的实用价值就是一眼看明白今天是几号。对我来说，它最大的作用就是好看，早起撕一页开始新一天，神清气爽。
由于我没有那个上来就把所有日历就撕掉直接看纸雕的魄力，而且还想看看露到一半的地球是个什么样子，这里就只能把店铺的成品图搬过来了。纸雕看起来还是比较细腻的，大尺度的海拔变化也有体现，想想一年后我就能有一个可爱的纸雕地球摆件，还是有点期待的。

                    <span>在上一篇油猴脚本使用指南中，我为大家简单介绍了用户脚本的前世今生，以及用户脚本的一些能力介绍。在这一篇中，我将就两个主要话题继续分享一下：一个是移动端浏览器使用用户脚本，另一个则是一些脚本的推荐。
关联阅读：油猴使用指南 01：传说中的「油猴」与用户脚本
移动端浏览器使用用户脚本
想要在移动端浏览器使用用户脚本，我们一般而言有两类选择：一是使用支持扩展插件的浏览器，通过安装扩展插件（如 Tampermonkey）来支持用户脚本；而如果浏览器不支持扩展插件，则可以直接支持用户脚本。
下面我也按照这两大类别简单介绍一下。
支持扩展插件的移动端浏览器
这里本来想展开写一下，但是发现 jijiali 和克莱德珠玉在先，已经写了这篇文章。我这里就不展开写了，仅作为省流助手，列几款常见的支持扩展插件的移动端浏览器。

Firefox：使用 Firefox 应用商店，使用自己的 Gecko 浏览器核心
Yandex：来自俄罗斯的应用，使用 Chrome 应用商店
Kiwi Browser：基于Chromium 核心，使用 Chrome 应用商店
神马浏览器（Sleipnir Mobile）：使用自己的应用商店

此外，最近还有这个浏览器值得一看——Iceraven：基于火狐同款的 Gecko 内核开发，支持扩展程序（Firefox 应用商店），如果你下载 Iceraven 会发现这两个界面几乎都一样，甚至 Iceraven 还支持火狐账户同步。

题外话：你可能会纳闷，Iceraven 和 Firefox 有什么区别呢？

根据 Iceraven 自己的 介绍，它有两个核心的区别：

Iceraven 可以访问 about:config 页面来做一些修改和调整
Firefox 只限制了部分附加组件在 Android 端使用，Iceraven 支持更多的附加组件。

                    <span>上次谈练字这件事已经是 四年前 了。彼时我并没有想到，未来的生活会和手里的纸笔越来越远。尤其是成功读研后，我的生活就和纸笔完全断了联系。脱离了需要一直手画重点的医学课本，电子版文献的数量剧增让我不得不告别此前什么资料都要打印出来的习惯，再一步步进化到完全在 iPad 上批注、听讲、做笔记，直到毕业了开始工作了，我手里还是有一大把没用完的墨水和笔芯。
这还只是摆在我桌面上的一部分
重提练字这件事，开始于前几天和因为钢笔认识的朋友聊天之后。他的工作内容比较传统，每天需要大量开会，几乎随时与纸笔为伴，随手写的笔记也字字有形——拉马克的「用进废退」理论用来直接解释进化论非常扯淡，映照在个体的生活中反而十分合理。如同缺乏日常使用的我几乎把本就不多的数学知识忘了个精光，等我尝试去好好写几个字，才发现握了笔，我的手都有点抖。
肌肉记忆也是需要唤醒的。我尝试着寻找了新的工具与合适的方法，重启我的练字之路。这篇文章我将主要从几个常常讨论到的问题出发，聊一聊现在还想练字的我们可能会考虑到、会发出疑惑的细节。
我能用平板和手机练字吗？
先说结论：不能。其原因和 这篇 英文书法入门指南中提到的类似。
或许你在各种社交平台见过那些在 iPad 上创作各种养眼的手写作品的影像，请记住，这些作者绝对不是在 iPad 上练好字才发出来的，而是先前已经有了写字的底子。iPad 对于会写字的人来说是一个只需要简单熟悉的新工具，而对于「不会写字」需要练字的我们来说，它并不是一个好的起点。
对于起源于象形符号，且正统书法审美来源于软笔书法的中文来说，即使在已经广泛使用硬笔作为书写工具的现在，想要更快抓住中文书写的要领，还是应当采用能够明确给予物理反馈的纸笔。如果以之前西文书法探讨的内容作为类比，中文书法，即使在使用硬笔时，也时时刻刻在采用基于「点尖」的书法技巧。如果你去观察一个正经现代书法家书写的钢笔字帖，就会发…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

因为我喜欢时常记录自己的生活，除了一堆所思所想的文字内容外，照片应用里也记录下了这几年的点点滴滴。除了偶尔怀旧，我也不会盯着相册的日日累积，只是任由相册占用的 iCloud 空间扩充着。
直到有一天，听到朋友为几万张照片的整理和去留烦恼时，翻看手机才意识到我的照片也已经超过了一万张。我决定给自己的相册瘦个身，主要是为了保证自己能够在海量的照片中快速定位到想找的内容，毕竟在此之前我就已经经历过很多次照片翻找不到的情况。但整理照片这件事情，我不需要一劳永逸，我更喜欢细水长流，有空的时候能够整理一下其实就足够了。
翻找应用，意外中意上国货「减法相册」
比起纯手动的 Slidebox，Cleanup 和 Gemini 的设计显然更得我心，但仅仅增加了重复照片这项功能就收价不斐，让我有些犹豫。近些年来，国人开发者的声量逐渐提升，照片处理领域就没有好的作品吗？
减法相册简洁的首页
答案显然是不，很快我就在社交平台上发现了「减法相册」这款应用，即使才发布了第一个正式版本，功能值得说道的同时颜值过关，可以说是质量不错的「国货应用」了。
减法相册看到了「随手」整理的需求
不是所有人的照片都会规规矩矩地拍好，修好，传到社交网站、社区平台的，大多数人是像我一样，拍完即走，偶尔修修，看心情发送的普通人。但这并不意味着普通人没有整理的需求，相反，普通人的相册更加需要整理，减法相册找到了这群人对于整理的不同层次的需求，也恰好匹配了我的想法。
我对于照片整理的首要需求是，能够让我以时间的维度纵观整体相册待整理内容，同时「细嚼咽慢」地整理相册，边看边回味边整理。…</span>

                    <span>Hi Everyone, I started Dream.In.Code 21 years ago when I was in high school. Since then the site grew to be one of the premier programming help sites on the internet in the mid-2000&#x27;s being the #1 site on google for dozens of &quot;[Language] Help&quot; and &quot;Programming Help&quot; searches with millions of visitors a month. We&#x27;ve had an incredible team of moderator and admins over the years that have kept the site clean, organized, and helped with thousands and thousands of questions. 



Dream.In.Code was originally just me learning how to install a forum and it turned in to a thriving community. Over the years, other sites have grown and changes in search rankings have seen traffic decline which also means advertising...

                    <span>Finding a cheap laptop that does everything you want it to do is not an easy task. Buying something at an affordable price inherently means corners have to be cut, so you have to look hard for something that fits your needs. That’s all the more true for gaming laptops, which need to have certain

                    <span>本文由西甲官方提供合作支持，首发 @体育产业生态圈 


前些天，一位西甲联盟的工作人员突然给我发了条消息：“有没有兴趣写篇文章，聊聊我们上赛季是如何帮助格拉纳达击败巴萨的？”
我当即愣在了原地，用不停颤抖的手指做出了回复：“这个……真的是能放到台面上讲的事情吗？”
等到对方发来一大堆资料和视频的时候，我才焕然大悟。原来故事是这样的：格拉纳达教练团队的分析师阿尔瓦罗-加西亚近期谈到了球队回到西甲后这两个赛季的成功里，数据分析起到了至关重要的作用。更神奇的是，他们的数据分析系统并不是俱乐部自己搭建的，而是西甲联盟对所有西甲和西乙球队免费开放的平台Mediacoach。
作为例子，他重点提到的就是今年四月格拉纳达客场2-1击败巴萨的那场比赛。


【那场比赛里发生了什么？】
已经过去了8个月的时间，可能不少球迷已经不太有印象了，所以咱们先简单回顾一下剧情：巴萨当时与皇马、马竞之间的西甲冠军竞争日趋白热化，那场比赛他们也牢牢掌握了控球权。上半场各种围攻并且由梅西打进一球，但下半场被马奇斯和莫里纳连入两球逆转。
那是格拉纳达队史首次在诺坎普击败巴萨，之前他们在这里的成绩惨到25场全败，连一分都没有拿到过。也是因为这场爆冷输球，巴萨错过了登顶积分榜首的绝佳机会，后来丢掉心气率先退出了冠军争夺。

那么问题来了，这场比赛和那个叫Mediacoach的数据平台有什么关系呢？
再来简单科普一下这个平台，这是由西甲联盟开发的数据分析可视化系统，通过架设在西甲和西乙42队主场的高速摄像头来采取每场比赛里的专业数据，最终形成一个庞大的数据库系统和大量自动生成的报告。
重点来了：这个平台对每一家俱乐部都完全开放，免费、没有VIP和白金会员，甚至还不停呼吁你们赶紧来白嫖。

有的俱乐部坚信天下没有白吃的午餐，本身也不怎么把数据分析当回事，但也有人产生了浓厚的兴趣，比如格拉纳达。系统上线时，这家来自安…</span>

                    <span>Is it even possible for 2 people to fully repopulate the Earth? According to Adam and Eve, it is, but there are some serious dangers of inbreeding that could kill off the next generation before they even get started. Don&#x27;t miss today&#x27;s new experiment to find out if the Bible creation story could actually be true.

We couldn&#x27;t have done it without the help of our realtors Monica and Laura @ realtor_monicasinger ! Im so thankful for this and couldn&#x27;t have done it without you perras either!!

                    <span>Companies that do business in the native language of their customer build better customer relationships. Although this may seem fairly obvious, it&#x27;s easier said than done.
After all, when your customer base is spread around the world, how do you scale your customer service?
Unbabel has built their business around the idea that customer service can be delivered in any language quickly and efficiently with the right blend of AI and human intelligence, creating a platform they call &quot;Language Operations&quot; or LangOps.
Jonathan Sowler, VP of Engineering at Unbabel, joins Dev Interrupted to talk about machine learning, what it takes to build a product that seamlessly integrates AI and human-powered translations, and why the future of language involves emojis.
Dan and Jonathan also rundown LinearB metrics and why Jonathan believes implementing LinearB has improved the health of Unbabel&#x27;s engineering team.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



What is LangOps?
How ML can be applied to different brands
Unbabel&#x27;s use of WorkerB

Why Unbabel chose to implement LinearB metrics

Jupyter emerged and gained respect for being an easy-to-install solution, in addition to bringing the proposed use to facilitate coding and visualization of the code, a form of interactive computing aimed at usability. With the success of Python, other market tools started to support this language and compete directly with Jupyter.
Now that I spoke well about jupyter, let’s go to the competition… :)

This post is a list of extensions and themes for Microsoft Visual Studio Code that I’ve used and recommend.
About VS Code
Visual Studio Code is an open-source editor developed and maintained by Microsoft, one of the most used and popular editors at the moment. Its popularity is mainly:
Possibility of “debug” by the editor.


Integration with GIT.


Lots of cloud integrations like Azure and GCP.


Possible to use with DevOps solutions such as Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes.


Having supported Windows, Linux, and Mac.


It supports the possibility of development for several languages like C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, and runtimes like .NET and Unity.

                    <span>React.memo() is one of those things that should be a part of every React developer&#x27;s arsenal. It gives us the ability to memoize a React component. As with any tool, before we delve into how to use React.memo(), let&#x27;s understand the problem first.
Memoization is a general concept which basically means caching the results of some kind of computation for later use. It is an optimization technique which is used quite extensively in the programming world.
An important point to remember is that whenever memoization is used, there must be a criteria which would dicate when the cached results are no longer valid and the computation must be done again.
To understand the problem this solves, consider the following React component:
import { useState, Fragment } from &quot;react&quot;;

                    <span>This blog was originally published on CodeCast.
To a lot of people, a new year means new potential. It feels like a fresh start and the drive to make changes and do well is at an all-time high. A lot of that is because after the madness of the holidays and reflecting on the year behind us, we’re able to take a slight break before going back into our routine - and often, we’d like that routine to change.
Resolutions are nothing new. They have been around for a very long time and even though a lot of people make resolutions they end up breaking, the idea behind the resolution is what we find important.
Striving to grow and change and be a better version of ourselves is something we should all be doing throughout our entire lives. It keeps everyone constantly moving forward and adapting, and …</span>

                    <span>Pytube is a great little Python utility for downloading videos from youtube as .mp4 files. It has a command-line interface that makes downloading videos as simple as entering the following command:
$ pytube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;....

Replace the URL with the Youtube URL of the video you want to download.
To make things even easier, I wrote a shellmarks wrapper script for this that provides an intuitive GUI form.

Simply paste in the URL and press “Download”, and it will download the video to your “Downloads” directory.
Pytube installation instructions can be found here.
The TLDR of the install instructions, if you have Python 3 already installed, is to open Terminal and enter:
$ pip install pytube

If pip happens to be the python2 version, you can try

I started programming for the web in the days of ASP (Active server pages). It was done using Visual Basic syntax so it was very basic. The form post to server and response was simple even though we didn&#x27;t do the fancy Javascript stuff we are doing today. 
Netscape navigator was the ruler among browsers then.
Lately I&#x27;ve been doing fontend with GWT and now React for the last couple of years. I love React but doing form, collecting server state and keeping state in sync on the client has been very challenging. I&#x27;ve used Redux, Jotai, Cerebral JS, Overmind JS (favorite) to name a few state libraries.

Data visualization libraries can make this process easier for you by providing tools and functions for creating charts and graphs from your dataset.

🟦 Material Design Award 2021

经过了多年的演进与迭代，Material Design 如今也已不再局限于简单的 Android 应用 UI 设计指南那样简单。为了启发更多开发者在 Material Design 现有的基础上进行创新、同时适应随时代变化的应用设计需求，Material Design 官方设计团队每年都会根据不同的设计准则来为评奖，借此鼓励在 Material Design 设计领域作出创新的 App —— 这一奖项即是 Material Design Award。
今年临近尾声，Material Design Award 2021 的评选也已经出炉。

由于稍早之前我们已经在少数派发布了关于的此次评选的专题文章，所以在本期周报中仅作相对简单的补充说明。虽然今年 MD Award 以暗色主题、大屏版本适配、动效设计而非 Android 12 中的 Material You 为评选参考这一标准略显奇怪，但更奇怪的其实一直是 Google 评选这些年度 App 的标准：今年上榜的三款除了 Post-it 与 Todoist 都是相对老生常谈的工具类 App 之外，另一个因暗色模式适配而上榜的 Meetly 更是一款在 Play 商店中不温不火的视频会议应用。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70537">

                    <span>无论是 Windows、macOS、Linux 还是在其他更小众的操作系统当中，文件管理器一定是最为常见也最为常用软件之一。
而在 Windows 平台，从古早时代的「我的电脑」到 Windows 7 的「计算机」，再到 Windows 10 时代的「此电脑」，Windows 资源管理器经过多年的更新和开发后已经拥有了较为完善的功能。随着 Windows 11 的发布，微软为资源管理器带来了一套全新的设计语言，但不少人所期待的标签页、文件标签、更好用的文件预览等特性依然缺席，也难免引来「换汤不换药」的质疑。
如果你和我一样对 Windows 资源管理器有着更多的需求，不妨来看看这款既有颜值、功能又十分强大的第三方文件资源管理应用 —— Files。

优雅是它给人的第一印象
与 Windows 原生的文件资源管理器相比，Files 进行了不少的界面优化。作为更加「现代」的文件管理器，它引入了大量的微软流畅设计语言，界面元素之间的间距更加舒适，还去掉了不少系统文件管理器中残留的过时设计。
与此同时，Files 依然严格遵循并跟进了 Windows 11 的最新特性，包括新的上下文菜单交互逻辑和最新的 API 接口。在这些特性的加持下，Files 颜值更高的同时也有着非常纯正的「原生味儿」。
例如，左侧原生的文件资源管理器中，鼠标移到图标上还会有 Windows 7 时代残留的蓝色选中框，而 Files 已经全面采用 Windows 11 的设计语言
不过要说二者在 UI 上最大的不同，还是对地址栏、搜索栏和快速操作栏的 UI 调整。在 Files 中，文件夹的定位按钮、地址栏和搜索栏的层级显然是更高的，针对具体文件的操作按钮和浏览方式按钮则下放到了与文件浏览界面的同一层级。个人认为，从逻辑上来说这样的布局方式是更加符合文件管理直觉的，操作时也能带来更强的条理感。

                    <span>我等了三年，就是要等一个机会，我要争一口气，不是证明我了不起，我是要告诉大家，我曾经失去的我一定要拿回来。

2021 年 10 月 28 日晚八点，尼康新品发布会。我正在上课，所以没有机会认真看完发布会的全部内容。但是当我看到开始铺天盖地在网上转发的尼康 z9 的信息后，心里面属实有点感慨。我慢慢地靠在椅子后背上，缓缓地舒了一口气。
千呼万唤的 Z9 终于来了（来自尼康官网）
小马哥等了三年，但是尼康等待了可远不止三年。这个曾经的巨人，在数据相机时代的冲击下一直显得有点力不从心，踉踉跄跄地想要站稳脚跟。作为一个消费者，和一个对尼康品牌有着特殊感情的人，他的努力我都看在眼里。但是我心里也清楚，在市场上，光有情感的支持并不能解决什么问题，尼康的产品一直给我一种想要努力赶上相机界一流水平的愿望，但是每次都差那么一点，差距还越来越大。甚至曾经有一段时间「尼康倒闭了吗」作为一个半调侃半认真的消息在中国互联网上疯传。

其实联想起它曾经的辉煌历史，和现在的对比往往会更加心酸。他曾经用自己高超的光学设计和先进的相机性能，谱写了相机界一个又一个近乎传奇的故事。对老用户近乎宠溺的照顾，既是口口相传的佳话，又是自缚的囚笼。
想要了解尼康的现在，就得了解他的过往。让我们先把时间拨回过去，回到100年前吧。
诞生在硝烟中
尼康的诞生与战争密不可分。1917 年，也许是因为在第一次世界大战预想到日后的战争需求，日本军方在军事仪器领域大力推进国产化。受此影响，东京测量仪器制造厂（東京計器製作所）的光学部门与岩城玻璃制造厂（岩城硝子製造所）的反射镜部门，在三菱集团（当时还称为三菱合資会社）社长岩崎小弥太的出资支持下集成，设立了日本光学工业股份公司（日本光學工業株式會社）。

想自己拍个视频、录个 Vlog，没人帮忙盯着构图，那就买一个无线图传？相机图传、监视器，少则几百，多则几千，对于业余玩家或者是刚入门的 UP 主来说，是一笔不小且非必要的支出。我们可以利用相机自带的 app，或者是第三方的附件、app，将我们的手机变成相机的监视器，方便在拍摄视频时进行构图。
使用相机自带的 App 连接
佳能、尼康、索尼、富士、松下 等品牌都为自家的相机提供了无线控制功能，只要手中的相机有蓝牙与 Wi-Fi 连接功能，即可在手机与相机配对后进行操控。
索尼 Imaging Edge Mobile
以索尼相机的 Imaging Edge Mobile 为例，打开相机的「智能遥控」app，使用手机或平板连接到相机的 Wi-Fi 热点后打开 Imaging Edge Mobile，点击「开始」或「连接新拍摄装置」，等待 app 自动连接。
但大部分入门级乃至中档的相机，内置的 Wi-Fi 都仅支持 2.4GHz 频段，信号功率并不算强，当距离稍远或周围的信号干扰一强，乃至转个身走远几步，就会出现卡顿、断连的问题，着实让人头大。（在这里点名批评索尼）
利用采集卡输入视频信号到手机
采集卡这种方法比较特别，通过相机的 HDMI 接口输出视频信号，经由视频采集卡借助 UVC 协议（USB video device class，支持 UVC 协议的数码设备可以在不安装驱动的情况下直接使用，实现免驱）输入到 Android 设备中，目前仅使用于支持 OTG 功能的 Android 手机，如果手机或平板支持 HDMI 信号直接输入…</span>

                    <span>谢邀~2021年从河西走廊到甘南，我有爱上甘肃的一万种理由~



【爱上甘肃的一万种可能】
我曾经想过一万种爱上甘肃的可能
却唯独忘记了它骨子里的桀骜不驯


在多年以后
只是见到它的一瞬间
我变沉沦了
——【小纪】自驾外星谷






【初识】
当初去兰州也只是匆匆一面，我甚至忘记曾经去过两次这件事，只是依稀记得当年上大学，坐着火车躺在卧铺上就出发了，沿途从夏天到冬天，绿色变成黄土坡，偶尔还有雪山。
后来我穿着破洞裤站在兰州站，寒风飕飕的往里刮，瑟瑟发抖。


【我怀念的】
从甘肃回来的半个月里，我一直都不能忘记旅途中的那种感受，从惊喜、到震撼、再到敬畏，怀念至今。
七彩丹霞，中国的大地彩虹。





外星谷，穿越宇宙吧！必去！必去！必去！！！






冰沟丹霞，被低估的嶙峋美





平山湖大峡谷，“媲美克罗拉多大峡谷”





甘加秘境，我大概会永远记得见到它第一面的震撼，庞然大物般的白石崖垂直在面前。









【自驾行程表】
Day1：落地张掖
Day2：张掖—七彩丹霞—冰沟丹霞；自驾约300km
Day3：外星谷—平山湖大峡谷—山丹军马场；自驾约327km
Day4：山丹军马场骑马—骊轩古城—武威；自驾约268km
Day5：天梯山石窟—永泰古城—兰州；自驾约400km
Day6：兰州—米拉日巴佛阁——尕秀村—郭莽湿地—郎木寺；自驾约350km
Day7：郎木寺—扎尕那；自驾约2650km
Day8：桑科草原—拉卜楞寺—甘家秘境；自驾约160km
Day9：甘家秘境—兰州（返程）；自驾约340km


【交通】
——飞机：去程是北京飞张掖；返程是兰州飞北京
——自驾：中途全程自驾，我们开的是理想ONE，好多人问我担心电车充电不方便，也担心不能跑西北。但其实理想ONE油电混合，可以跑880km左右。
在市区充满电就行，加油站也挺多。颠簸感很低…</span>

I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube for the Beem Team. I&#x27;ve built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob&#x27;s house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I&#x27;ve never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can&#x27;t wait for you to see what is next. 

If you’re reading this you’re a real one! 
Comment “Fortnite Chapter 3!&quot; so I can notice you!

Not Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a Real Life Fortnite Battle Bus to celebrate the release of Fortnite Chapter 3!</span>

Alright so in this video I made some custom minecraft bosses and got a real mod developer to react to/review my designs. I ended up making bosses for the amethyst geodes, mountains, and nether biomes. They turned out really good! Sorry this video took so long to come out, we&#x27;re working on some big things! My mental health is on an unbelievably sharp decline, so I don’t know when I will be back, but I love making videos so I won’t be gone forever

                    <span>This was very emotional for me and my family. We flew in from Hawaii to surprise our family in Missouri with the exciting news!! They had absolutely no idea we were coming. They thought we couldn&#x27;t make it to Thanksgiving, but we figured out their plans and showed up anyway. Telling them was one of the most fun things we have ever done!

iOS「辅助功能」里你可能不知道的那些小技巧

🔋 充电量：98
作者：JLDUAN

大家是否还记得，在那个 iPhone 操作依赖 Home 键的时代，有些朋友为了延长 Home 按键的寿命，特意打开了辅助设置中的 AssistiveTouch 。随着 iPhone 交互与设计的不断进化，带 Home 键的 iPhone 已经逐渐被全面屏 iPhone 所取代。
时至今日，已经很少再见到有人启用 AssistiveTouch 了。除了 AssistiveTouch 之外，辅助功能里还隐藏着这些有趣的小功能，值得大家一试。

编辑荐语（Tp）：对于 iOS 用户而言，「辅助功能」就像金银岛一样，有着许多「宝藏」却鲜为人知。尽管辅助功能最初的目的是为了方便特殊群体使用 iPhone，但其中的不少功能对于大众而言也具有实用价值。作者在这篇文章中为我们搜集了 8 个值得一试的功能，从「广为人知」的轻点背面到系统级白噪音，这些功能总会让作为 iOS 用户的你发现新天地。
其中的引导式访问虽然是从非常早期的 iOS 版本就已经存在，但它依然是许多人未能搞懂的功能。它除了能防止他人在用你手机时瞎划乱动，还可以帮你更好地…</span>

这样画思维导图最有用
 
辛辛苦苦工作一年，工作又多又杂，但在写年终总结时，偏偏又感觉总是没办法一一写到？如果能用思维导图来梳理工作成绩，一定能让你的年终总结显得有条理，又详细。
通过思维导图，我们可以快速厘清思路，或者发散自己的想法。但是你有没有想过，在绘制思维导图的时候采用的方法都是正确的吗？很多人在绘制思维导图的时候都有着这样或那样的误区，如果能够注意到这些问题，就可以让思维导图更好地发挥作用。
作者 @Megabits 结合个人的学习和实践总结出一套优秀的思维导图利用方案，编写了《这样画思维导图最有用》系列教程。希望可以让更多人用对思维导图这样一个有趣又有效的思维工具。

                    <span>今年国庆期间，我上线了一款用来记录性生活的 App —— Aphrodite，除了因为切中目标用户的需求痛点而获得夸赞之外，我被问到最多的问题就是「为什么要开发这样一款应用」，以及「记录性生活有什么意义？为什么要记录？」。
在我已知的大部分人的观念里，「性生活」都是足够隐秘甚至禁忌的话题，相应地，「记录性生活」也被认为是荒唐之举，因此在 Aphrodite 上线后，我在社媒上照例去「吹嘘」的时候，收获更多的是来自于朋友们的质疑与不理解…… 这也是我写这篇文章的初衷之一，我想聊聊开发 Aphrodite 背后的故事，以及我所理解的「记录性生活的意义」。

Aphrodite 背后的故事
在 Aphrodite 之前，我一直使用 iPhone 自带的健康应用来记录我的性生活，通过快捷指令它可以很便捷地记录性生活发生的时间及是否使用保护措施，但也仅限于此。我用了什么姿势、在哪里发生、时长、是否使用道具等等，一次性生活中值得被记录下来的参数有太多太多，iPhone 自带的健康应用完全无法满足我的需求。而当我尝试在 App Store 搜索后却失望地发现，整个应用商店的几百万 App 里，在做这件事儿的只有寥寥几款 App。
Aphrodite 提供详细的记录功能，甚至贴心地准备了「自慰记录」
在一切都数字化的今天，记录饮水、记录运动的 App 比比皆是，甚至记录排便也可以在 App Store 搜到一长串结果，但同样作为与身体健康密切相关、成人生活中必不可少的重要组成部分，性生活记录的相关应用却少得可怜——这是不合理的。
尽管在立项之初就认识到这一定是一个很小众的 App，甚至能否过审都是未知（后来在提审时确实也经历了各种坎坷），但无论是从自己的需求出发还是本着作为产品经理「想要做一些有意义的产品」的初心，我都不得不把它做出来。
这是我开发…</span>

前言
关于圣诞，我一直有许多想象，冰岛就是这些想象之中的耶路撒冷。
两年前的今天，我刚刚适应了异国读书的生活，眼看着迎来第一个圣诞长假，思来想去还是决定把目的地设在冰岛。和女友商量一番并试图拉来更多伙伴同行未果后，我们最终决定两人一车自驾游玩。一方面是来读书前开过一段时间车，手还没太生，另一方面觉得不自驾或许会辜负了美景。两年之后回忆起来，这着实是个疯狂而又值得的决定。
因为各种原因，当下出境游玩对大家来说都变得越来越不好实现。也因此，这段冰岛自驾的经历也在我心里愈发闪光。虽然行前做了完备的计划，但我一直没有从头到尾地总结过此事，只零散地发过 一些照片。借着又到圣（re）诞（du），这次好好回顾一下这个近期很难再有的经历。
这篇的属性更接近于攻略而非游记。事实上，少数派上能搜到许多自驾相关内容，@老麦 半年前还非常系统地分享了 西南自驾之旅，特别好特别推荐。这些内容在我整理本篇时帮助都非常大，推荐大家去看看的同时，也感谢各位的分享。
想写这篇的原因也在于，看了这些我发现自己的经验和各位还是有很多不重叠的部分，我也会更侧重地写这些不重叠的、针对冰岛冬季自驾的部分，或许也可以覆盖一些冬季在国内东北、西北的自驾场景。
在读之前，我希望你在脑中能对冰岛冬季自驾有一个大概的轮廓：

冰岛是左舵右行，高速公路只有双向两车道；
城镇密度低，没有太多像样的休息区；
圣诞节前后每天日照时间少于五小时；
冬季海风非常非常大，「风暴」很常见；
天气阴晴不定，雨雪后路面非常滑，时常封路；
……

可能这份攻略你一时半会都还用不上，但我们总有下一个冬天。

【1】
“公主，快起身吧，再晚就要挨训了。”小寅子急得已经半个身子踏出门槛，回首大声催促着。
“急什么，这就快了。太后最宠我们公主了，多晚也不打紧。”阙儿一边说着，脚下左半步右半步来回踱着，仔细检查我的妆容。
半晌，待阙儿终于满意了，对着镜子里的我说，“我们公主真真儿是娇俏明艳，今儿晚定能艳杀四方。”
我扑哧一声笑了出来。
皇宫里就我一个公主，这是要艳过母后呢，还是压一头皇祖母？


到了宫宴上，太后看我慈笑道，“婉扬来啦，你今天可是来晚了，元辰刚闹着要挨着本宫坐，把你的玉案抢去了呢。”
我朝上看去，那本来是我专属的青玉案上果然坐着元辰那个小矮子。他刚准备用小肉手去够吃食，突然听到有人喊他名字，呆在那里一脸傻懵。
环顾四周，只有靠角落一个空座位了。
脚下止了一瞬，转而又大步走了过去。
半步的迟疑是因为那个案台旁座，是顾胤良。


我和顾胤良的第一段梁子也是源于一场宫宴。
那年我五岁，顾胤良六岁。
酒足饭饱后，台下的大臣们愣是从南疆边境纷争聊到了东沧国太子新得了一颗三钱大的冠螺珠。
那时的我天生懒骨，走哪都是歪着倒着，正趴在太后的膝上打盹。
“说到世间珍宝，当属顾大人家的暖香玉。炎暑中自散馥香，冰寒天玉暖生烟。”
听罢，我从迷迷糊糊中起了精神，眼里慢慢聚起精光。
“顾大人，那暖香玉是供奉在在府中吗，哪天领我们一饱眼福？”
已然微醺的顾尚书摆摆手，笑道，“唉，一块玉石而已，谈不上稀奇，一直戴在小儿身上。”
至此我已经趁众人不注意，径自冲向台下。
顾家公子我认识，就是那一堆小人儿里稍微好看一点的那个。
我伸着手，直直的就往顾胤良扑过去，企图去拽他脖颈里的吊绳。
彼时顾胤良一脸惊恐，本能的一手护住自己的衣领，一手把我往外推。
嘿，我，楮婉扬，大楮皇室十三子嗣里唯一的掌上明珠，大名鼎鼎的嘉垣公主，自打生下来…</span>

                    <span>甘肃，最“瓷实”的模样，最悠然的姿态，藏在早餐里。
这是一个狭长的省份，当最东边的庆阳看到第一缕阳光时，西边的敦煌还是明月高悬。巨大的经纬跨越，也扩大了早餐的选择范围，当甘肃人迎着日出逐渐醒来，他们手里的早餐，可能完全不同。


尽管如此，早餐赋予的是同样的朝气，以及，不管甘肃哪里的早餐，都长得十分“瓷实”。瓷实，是因为重视，甘肃有多重视早餐呢？这么说吧，牛肉面，甘肃最扎实，最著名的一碗面，兰州人就留给了早晨。
寻常的油条包子菜夹馍，是早餐中的一种吃法，如果你有心留意，走进甘肃各地街头巷尾热气蒸腾的早餐店里，会进入一个甘肃特色的早餐江湖——



当兰州人早上“扎”起一碗牛肉面，酒泉人在吃浓稠的糊锅，武威人在吃“硬核”菜面，张掖人在吃牛肉小饭，陇西人在吃热凉面，陇南人在吃面皮，天水人出门吃呱呱，在家就着干馍喝罐罐茶......

夜市的热闹被黑夜稀释殆尽，吃早餐的甘肃人平平淡淡，轻言细语，却是一份实在的温情。悠闲的人们，三言两语问候邻里，坐在店里吃完，再捎一份带将出去。分量超足的早餐吃完，甘肃人元气满满的一天，才正式开始。


 早上吃面，“肃面朝天”！
面条在外地，大多拿来当午餐或者晚餐，可甘肃人“固执”地认为，面条在早上口感最佳。兰州牛肉面能成为甘肃美食“一哥”，很大原因就是它在早餐界雷打不动的地位。不过，甘肃绝不只有牛肉面，各地都能看到早上“咥面”的场景，尤其是河西走廊各地，纷纷端出自己的牛肉面“改造款”。



不来个“牛大碗”，这床白起了！
在兰州，公认的主流早餐就三个字：牛肉面，再亲切些，两个字也行——牛大。许多兰州人每天开口说的第一句话，大概都是：“老板，来一碗牛大”！





每天的清晨六点半左右，数以千计的牛肉面馆同时开门营业，黄河两岸的大街小巷里，到处飘荡着牛肉面诱人的香味。
对于兰州人来说，牛肉面是可以私人定制的早餐，“师傅，下个二细，辣子多些蒜苗多…</span>

                    <span>肉的质地一直是个神奇的命题。
有的人烧出来的肉软硬适中，有的人照着同样的菜谱却死活做不出来。烧菜的火力、时间，甚至油、淀粉的使用都对肉的质地产生重要的影响。
肉是嫩还是老，核心点是温度，因为它决定了熟肉的2个核心要素：肌纤维的状态和水含量
回到上面这个提问来，我们先来看看肉越炖越烂、越炒越硬背后的原因。
也就是说，温度是怎么影响肉里面肌纤维状态和水含量的？


肉其实是个“水货”，肉重量的70-80%都是水。

可是这个“水货”伪装的特别好，即使它里面大部分是水，你却看不出来。
因为水不会流出来。
为什么不流出来呢？这就跟肌肉的结构有关系了。

肌肉是由一束束肌原纤维组成的，就是上图右上角的Myofibril，水就存在肌原纤维里面。
一般情况下，水是被紧紧包裹在里面的，即使你用力挤也挤不出来。
“时间就像肌肉里的水，你怎么挤也挤不出来”--开尔文
但是，如果肉的温度上升的话，里面的肌球蛋白和肌动蛋白就会因为聚集而失去弹性 (蛋白变性)，这种强悍的储水能力就消失了。

上图是牛肉在不同温度下逐步失水和变硬的过程，总的来说是有两轮的变化。
第一轮变化是在115-120°F (46-49°C)开始的，肉的体积开始缩小，因为肌球蛋白开始变性聚集了；
第二轮变化是在150-163°F (66-73°C) 开始，肉的体积开始进一步缩小，这回是肌动蛋白变性聚集了。
在整个变化的过程中，牛肉中的肌纤维在持续的聚集、收缩，把里面储存的水“挤”了出来。
原来被肌纤维包裹的“非自由水”变成了可以流动的“自由水”。
所以我们在用筷子捅一下半熟的牛排，能看到红色的血水渗出来。

就像上图一样，鸡肉的纤维在加热前是比较饱满的，在水煮或者焙烤后都发生了不同程度的脱水和皱缩。
也就是说，在温度上升时肉在同时经历变熟和变老的过程。
在原理上，食品安全和美味似乎是无法兼得的。
但努力的吃货们总有办法把这两种冲突错开。

比如我们针对肉片的大火爆炒。
在肌肉纤维收缩之前把肉煮熟了，然后在肉汁大量流出之前熄火，尽可能地保留肉片的口感。
但是对于厚度比较大的肉块，这样会增大肉块内外部的温差。
比如，大火煎一块厚牛排的时候，内外部的温差可能会达到40度以上，煎完时可能会出现下图中Blue rare这样的情况。

如果想做成左下角Medium rare这种效果呢？
那就得小火慢煎，将内外部的温差控制在15度以内，这样才比较好达到外焦里嫩的效果。
但是，对于炖煮了一两个小时的肉来说，上面的原理好像不完全适用。
明明已经长时间加热的肉，为什么还能保持不变老呢？
一是因为炖煮时候火候控制的比较好，水的损失比较少；
二是有一种新的物质代替了水，赋予了肉润滑的口感。
它就是结缔组织溶解后产生的明胶


在长时间的炖煮中，捆绑住肌纤维束的结缔组织会发生溶解.
这些新生成的明胶给我们的口腔提供了一种润滑的口感。
但是，被过度加热的明胶同样会被煮干，润滑的作用也会消失。
为什么烧完的肉反复加热会越来越老？
那是因为水和明胶被煮干了，肉变柴了，润滑的口感也消失了。
最典型的例子就是用微波炉加热剩菜。
因为微波炉加热的速度太快、过程中也没法观察，所以一不留神就会出现过度加热的情况。
用微波炉热好的肉菜，尤其是不带汤那种，拿出来时候容易会变得又干又硬。
所以，二次加热时候同样需要注意控制火候，避免过度加热。
这也是烧完的肉反复加热会变老的原因。

总结

温度是影响肉质地的关键，因为它决定这肌纤维的状态和肉的含水量。
温度上升时，肉在同时地变熟和变老。
大火爆炒、小火慢煎、炖煮等方法的恰当使用可以减少肉质变老。
二度加热时候要同样注意，避免过度加热把肉煮硬。

                    <span>说到「社交牛逼症」，我狼哥必须拥有姓名。
这人上过山，下过海，扛过枪，受过伤，手下百十号兄弟。
而我是个卖家发错货都不愿联系客服退换货的重度「社交恐惧症」患者。
我跟狼先生的感情之所以能维系至今，有两个重要原因：
一是我社恐得连分手都懒得说，二是他牛逼得没工夫搭理我。
1、
我叫小猫，一个长得有一点点儿好看，但命运不咋好看的女子，十八岁那年死过一次，后来又偷活了一生。
现在我三十六岁，在东北某新一线城市的风景区有一栋半山别墅，城区两端共有三套高层河景房，有一辆撒哈拉，一辆大指挥官，一辆指南者。
我这双手曾握过撬棍，抡过扳手，当过修车工，现在我是专职小说作者，大多数时间都在敲键盘，不敢自诩成功，但足以养活自己和自己的爱好。
可因为我至今独自生活，不喜欢与人交流，所以被贴了一身标签，剩女，败犬女，女汉子，单身主义，不婚主义，女权主义，诸如此类，不胜枚举。
其实这些都不是我，我不信奉任何主义，只是单纯地喜欢自由，没有活成这世界对女性定义的样子而已。
我喜欢硬派车，喜欢山河远阔，这是因为我在十八岁那年，傍上了一位四十岁的硬汉大佬。
没错，不是大款，是大佬，有那个社交牛逼症，兄弟一大堆，大的管叫他狼一，小的管他叫老大，我在这里就叫他狼先生。
而我与他初见时没有记忆，所以也没有名字，一切都是后来他给我的。
十八年前我们在一场婚礼上相遇，新郎是他一个兄弟，新娘是一位好心的小姐姐。
小姐姐叫江菲，是个文艺女青年，在济南一所大学门口开书店，通过交笔友爱上了一位兵哥哥杨一帆。
那年杨一帆退役，两人订好了年底结婚，她想招个临时看店的，而我就像个游魂一样，阴差阳错地闯了进来。
江菲说我当时简直惨得不像样，脸色惨白，头上包着绷带，不记得自己是谁，但很饿，急需一个吃饭的地方，隔壁饭店的人说她在招工，我就来了。
江菲胆子真大，不但收留了我，带我去医院换药，还帮我寻找家人，但最终没有结果，于是就在出嫁的时…</span>

红烧肉，中国餐桌的绝对主角。无论哪位厨子、无论哪种菜系，当与红烧肉狭路相逢的时候，所有的个性、技法、风格、创意，都要为这道国民大菜妥协让路。红亮、酥糯，五味调和、香气绵长，这是中国菜对红烧肉的共同标准，也是中国人对红烧肉的集体记忆。如果说麻婆豆腐、葱烧海参、白切鸡和蟹粉狮子头，分别代表了川、鲁、粤、淮扬的门面味道，是中国食谱里最受瞩目的四根台柱。那么红烧肉，无疑是凌驾其上的，更重要的国菜栋梁。一沽好酒一盅肉，一江明月一江秋。






No.1 壹
红亮的颜色，是红烧肉最诱人的标签，也是无数人为之垂涎的理由。吊诡的是，提供红烧肉颜色的主要成分：焦糖，却是无味的。无论是冰糖炒制的糖色，还是添加了焦糖的老抽酱油，它们的主要成分，是糖类受热碳化之后产生的焦糖酐(C12H18O9) 焦糖烯 (C36H50O25) 焦糖素(C125H188O80)等有机化合物。






它们几乎不提供人类能吸收利用的有效成分，所以人的味蕾也不易感受到它们的味道——有经验的厨师都知道，熬糖色，有甜味就是火候未到、有苦味就是熬得过头。真正恰到好处的糖色，应该尝不到任何味道。为什么这种无味的天然色素，被添加进平平无奇的炖肉中，却能让人的眼睛主观觉得“好吃”“香”“鲜美”？



其中原因，可能是人类大脑对美拉德反应带来的棕化物质，与焦糖这两种颜色外表相近的有机化合物产生了误判。众所周知，蛋白质是由多个氨基酸，以固定结构组成的肽链。人类只能吸收分散打碎的氨基酸，无法吸收其他生物的蛋白质：这是很多消化功能不好的人，会对部分高蛋白食物产生异体过敏的本质原因。一部分蟹、虾、蚝、贝，即便极简烹饪，或者生吃，也能感受到其中氨基酸鲜甜味，是因为低等生物的蛋白质结构相对简单，白酒、醋、姜蒜等简单腌料和人类的唾液，就能打碎它们的肽链。

                    <span>In the final round of the 2021 PNC Championship, Team Woods fired a 15-under 57 to get to 25-under par for the tournament and finish solo second.

This week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.

                    <span>In the opening round of the 2021 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods card a 10-under 62 to sit three shots back after Saturday in Orlando.

This week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.

                    <span>That was crazy...
Today I robbed banks and during the heist I would switch into NPC clothes to confuse the cops. The plan surprisingly worked and led to some insane events happening. There are a ton of funny moments in this GTA 5 episode, enjoy!

                    <span>我们通常以抢断和封盖来作为评价一名球员防守能力的指标，如果一个球员能够做到场均抢断封盖1+1，那么他很可能会是个不错的防守人。
​赛季至今，除去那些出场数不足的球员，总共有13人能做到抢断封盖1+1。如果把筛选条件收紧，要求至少抢断1.7+封盖1.1，目前就只有一人达标，那就是76人前锋赛布尔。
精英级别的防守是赛布尔在NBA立足的卖点，而在费城球队无法使用本-西蒙斯的当下，如何让赛布尔发挥能量势必会成为教练组内部讨论的重要议题。
我们也不妨就着这一话题展开讨论，探讨赛布尔使用上的确定性。
从2019年季后赛对位伦纳德以后，西蒙斯就确定了自己防守核心的战术地位。那么在西蒙斯缺席的当下，能否利用赛布尔的防守能力，弥补西蒙斯不在带来的影响？
在给出答案之前，我们或许可以看看赛布尔这赛季在防守端的角色，看看他在防守端都做了些什么事情。
比如在刚结束的对阵篮网的比赛，赛布尔就被指派了单防杜兰特的任务。赛布尔之所以能被赋予如此重要的防守职能，无非是对他防守能力的信赖，而他的能力也有数据支撑：赛季至今，和赛布尔对位的进攻球员平均命中率只有35.4%。



你也可以看到，即便是强如杜兰特，对上赛布尔也很少采用拉开一对一的方式，因为赛布尔足够强壮，可以顶住进攻球员的背身；横移速度够快，也不吃晃，想拉开强突不容易，同时有一对长臂和不俗的瞬间爆发力来干扰进攻球员的投篮，想要一对一占到便宜实在很难。
或许下面这个进攻回合，你可以感受到赛布尔单防的压力：当杜兰特原地干拔投篮，赛布尔顺势举手上前干扰，而他举手干扰的高度是真的可以挡到杜兰特投篮视野的。
杜兰特投篮被干扰的情景，好像不常见吧？



杜兰特当然知道防他的小伙子是个强者，所以他也没有非要用一对一这种吃力不讨好的方式展开进攻。
面对赛布尔的防守，杜兰特更多是采用无球跑动甩开，再接队友的传球攻筐，或者持球利用队友设置的掩护，借此绕开赛布尔的…</span>

本周话题：音乐是反社交
Spotify 的前产品经理有一天在推特发言，总结自己这些年在音乐行业的心得。
第一条心得就很震撼。
&quot;本质上，音乐不是社交产品，而是反社交的。&quot;

我看到以后，愣了一下，马上意识到，这句话说得太对了。音乐和社交是对立的，音乐产品不合适加入社交功能。
听音乐的时候，绝大多数都是一个人，而且都是静静地听，没人喜欢在吵闹的环境听。音乐是一种心灵对话，是孤独时候的陪伴，不具有社交性。

聚会时，大家不会一起听音乐。音乐从来不是社交活动，相比之下，美食、逛街、旅游、甚至看电影，这些才是社交行为，一个人去做没有乐趣。
音乐不具有社交性，还有一个原因，那就是很少有人对你听什么音乐感兴趣。你真的在意，朋友喜欢听哪一首歌吗？
因此，音乐产品应该是个人化产品，关注的重点是个人使用，而不应该加入社交元素。
世界最大的两个音乐应用 Spotify 和 Apple Music 都没有社交元素，界面都很清爽，几乎没有听音乐以外的功能。


它们有全世界最庞大的用户群，最精准的兴趣匹配算法，却没有提供任何的交友和社区功能。这是他们的产品经理没有想到，还是觉得就不应该添加这种功能？
形成鲜明对照的是，国内的音乐大厂&quot;网易云音乐&quot;，主打功能就是社交。打开它的 App，处处都有社交元素，可以查看每首歌的网友点评，收听他人的歌单和电台，还可以加好友、聊天、建社交圈。

网易云音乐的官方定位是&quot;一个快速发展的云生态音乐社区&quot;，口号是&quot;和超8亿有趣的人听歌看…</span>

                    <span>电影《雄狮少年》今天终于上映了！从2019年到今天，经过两年多的时间，今天终于要和大家见面了，关于对于这部电影的评价，我想把它交给观众。今天我想跟大家分享一下这部电影一些创作点滴和自己的一些背景。
根据我们故事的风格和特点，我们整个美术风格是偏写实的，卡通程度没有那么高。镜头里的场景，光影，氛围都在尽量还原真实的岭南村庄。而我们的角色必须融入这个环境，没有违和感，而且用他们演绎一个这么烟火气的故事必须可信。
狮头我们完全是按照真实狮头来的，没有加入过多设计，因为我们觉得真实狮头的设计就已经非常经典了。而真实的南派狮头是有多种风格的，因此我们在电影里采用了三种不用造型的狮头：“传统狮头”（陈壮成、年轻时的咸鱼强使用的狮头）“新派狮头”（阿娟使用的狮头）和“鹤山狮头”（无极狮队使用的狮头）


关于人物

刚开始尝试了很多版本，每个角色大概都有7-8稿吧，有些设计是很成熟的，但总觉得没有画出我们心中那种有烟火气的市井的感觉。
后来我们找到了光圈，他的设计风格正好和我们的需求完美契合，每个角色几乎都是第一稿就能确定方向。
最终定版人物形象的原因：小人物的故事、突出小人物的朴素感、结合故事背景是乡村少年、故事中的人物最终也要打破偏见


关于场景

因为我们大部分故事是发生在乡下，所以我们跑遍了广州周边各种村落。
最后我们在顺德找到了两个最符合我们想象的村子：百丈村和北水村，这里有鱼塘，村里的房子就散布在大大小小的鱼塘上，非常漂亮。而且还有一些很有历史的祠堂和老宅子，最重要的是，这里还有很多村民居住，很有生活气息。

有些村子虽然很有历史，但已经变成旅游景点，村民基本已经不在那里生活了，感觉只剩一个壳，没有灵魂了。






然后我团队就开始一遍遍去这两个村子里采风，搜集各种村民生活的细节，还有了解村里的植被，南方乡村的植被是很有特点的，非常丰富。
我们要了解这里植被的种类，墙上的青苔是怎样的，缝隙里的小草是怎样的，有哪些常见的树，怎样分布的。




还有这些植物的四季变化，因为我们故事的时间跨度有一年多，我们的采风也持续了一年。
同时我们还开发了一系列的技术流程去呈现这些内容，为了研究木棉的生长规律，我们特效总监甚至把电脑搬去一棵木棉树下去工作了两天。

最后呈现出来的效果我们都非常满意，观看有些画面时甚至都能闻到村子里的味道。大家都觉得这些付出很值得。


关于舞狮

首先是动作的问题，舞狮有很多技巧，专业性很强，要通过肢体动作去表现狮子各种各样的神态，之前我们是完全不了解的。为了弥补这个问题，我们导演组和动画师特意去专业的舞狮队做了培训，然后才开始设计舞狮相关的动作场面。为了打起来更漂亮，我们还融合了一些武术和舞蹈动作，做了适当的夸张。
然后就是布料和毛发的解算问题，狮子身上的毛发非常多，而且是多层布料解算（舞狮队员身上有衣服，然后外面还要披上狮尾），再加上狮尾复杂的剪裁方式（现代的狮尾结构很复杂，中间还加了橡皮筋增加弹性，在舞狮的时候可以伸缩）是一个非常复杂的系统工程。我们都一一作了仔细的研究和测试，最终在三维软件中模拟出完美的动态。
最后就是渲染，毛发渲染一向是三维渲染中最耗时的工作之一，一两头狮子还好。但我们的决赛有130多头狮子出现，现场看台上有1800多个观众，再加上公园里围观的1000多名游客，还有大量茂密的植被......想想就是一件很可怕的事情，最初我们都不确定能不能渲染出来，我们做了大量的研究和开发工作才能保证决赛镜头的顺利渲染。
我们这部电影在条件有限的情况下，大家都憋足了一口气要做最棒的作品，这种感觉太棒了，能和他们一起创作是我的荣幸。

要特别说一句的是我们音乐总监栾慧，他为了这部作品推掉了很多工作，专门从东北老家来到广州在我们楼下宾馆里搭建了一个工作室和我们一起工作了半年多，所以这次我们的音乐和画面契合度非常高，因为我随时都能下楼和他一起讨论关于音乐的想法，而且他随时都能上楼看到我们最新的画面，甚至有很多重要戏份的剪辑都是根据他的音乐，我和他一起做了精确的调整，达到音乐和画面的完美匹配。
而且我们在制作中经历了疫情封锁，我们公司所在的芳村正好处于疫情中心，一夜之间整个区域停止一切活动，我们只能居家办公，也因此导致了制作的延期，当时的绝望情绪现在还历历在目，还好政府迅速控制住了疫情，而我们也利用这次延期的机会做了一些很重要的修改，让我们的作品更进一步，也算是因祸得福吧。
   很荣幸这一路遇到了很多志同道合的朋友们，也感谢那些与我们素未谋面的观众们的喜爱和支持。希望更多人也能关注到我们国产原创动画，也希望中国传统文化被更多年轻人追逐。

                    <span>想来聊点背后的故事。或许有生之年很难再遇上像2020东京奥运一样的情形了（也别再来了）。
 备赛四年变五年。记不清是央视采访哪位运动员来着，她说，“那天一早去训练馆，瞅着倒计时牌从100多天跳成了400多天。一下泄了劲儿，特崩溃”。100%的真实回应，不分项目，也无关国籍。
就我而言，多出来的一年，比前面四年难得多的多。撇开年龄和体能，最大的顾虑是家庭。因为疫情，得全封闭训练。其实我家就住天津，离不远的，两个女儿都还小外加老人，本是最需要我的时候，担子却全落在了妻子身上。
艳子曾经也是一名举重运动员，所有的纠结和挣扎她最懂。后来，她反倒跑来宽慰我说，“就暂时把你交给国家了。（其他）别担心。”这话，是真扎到我心里了，同时也是继续坚持的最大动力。
 说回备战，变化很多。先是时隔20年首次级别调整。我那会考虑到岁数大之后你降体重，肯定对各方面有影响。索性打81，上了4公斤。但实际上，我和余导对把增加的体重转换成更稳定的技术这方面，什么经验都没有。
 东奥最棘手还有个什么呢，是国际举联修改的新积分规则，要求必须在2018年11月-2020年4月的三个比赛区间内完成6站积分赛。相当于每两个月就得打一次高强度比赛。就这段时间，我遭遇了生涯内最艰难的一场比赛。也是给自己逼到绝境的一场。
 2019年9月的泰国芭提雅积分赛，决定拿不拿得到东奥入场券的关键比赛。抓举我开把是165，有点着急了，往前迈了两步掉了，把腰扭了。一个小关节的错位，当时没感觉太出来。第三把，我和小14岁的队友李大银都抓了171。一切就看挺举了。
 两项间歇时，身体反应就显出来了。动不了，腰肌一下子缩到一团，弯腰都弯不下去。没办法，只能把挺举第一把从计划的200降到191，想着先保个总成绩吧。杠一扔，痛感爆发，走路都走不了，人被架着下场了。
当时余导过来劝，要不放弃吧，别把身体搞坏了。怎么说呢，没来及想什么多的，就一条，不想放弃每一把，边趴着敷冰袋边回：“不可能，确实不能（弃）”。完了第二把直接加到了205。因为是最高重量，可以等全部人举完再上，也算是战术给自己换多点休息时间。
 205，是刷新世界纪录的重量。完全是咬死了牙才撑起来的。杠一扔，人就往一边歪了，勉强没倒地。没多久，大银最后一把举过了206，二刷纪录。当时全场就剩我的第三把，顶了个207。这是一个我从来没有在国际比赛上挑战过的重量，但能不能去东京就此一举了。再怎么疼，也不想留遗憾，必须再试一把，给它拼了！

要说犹没犹豫过腰伤呢，也犹豫，但一上台感觉就来了。也不是纯说胜负欲吧，就是想把最好的一面展现给全世界热爱举重的人看。我是真喜欢台上的感觉。
 说到胜负欲，对2016年的里约奥运，是有的。五年来继续坚持的理由，有它一份，想再较量一把，还是有那么点不服气吧。
 说个东奥决赛开场前的小插曲，也是后来少见开把没成的教训。权当给大伙避雷。
 那会中国举重队已经收了三个级别的冠军，我是有压力的。后台区就一直在调情绪，调着调着感觉要爆棚了，还跑去跟余导提“要不开抓170吧”。没同意，依旧165，完了没带起来（兴奋过头随意了）。下场余导很严肃说要重视，我也跟自己说：“就两把了，不能再乱来了。”静下来一步步想动作，怎么带，怎么展。抓举成绩稳在了170。

 挺举开把实话说有瞬间，闪过了2016年的画面。抬杠那下，还是有点害怕掉了的，咬牙硬顶。197一过，心态就完全放开了。第二把204，从握杠就憋足了气，完事锁定金牌后，是有点小喜悦的，趁着斗志又报了210。翻站的时候调铃没有调好，稍微歪了点，丢了。有点可惜。
 评价什么的不敢讲，比赛很享受，但过程真的很难很难。最想说的是，这份荣誉不光属于个人，而是实实在在地属于整个中国举重队。
 我是吕小军，一个像热爱生命一样热爱举重的中国人。

                    <span>总要有人去做一些不同的事
——写于国重成立十周年
计算机体系结构国家重点实验室（以下简称国重）成立十年了，这是一个里程碑。在脑海中回忆着和国重相关的事，一幕幕场景浮现，甚至包括2003年第一次到计算所参加研究生复试的场景。那时，计算所历经沧桑的大门还在，而自己还是一张科研白纸，不知道如果被计算所录取了，将来会在这里干什么。幸运的是跌跌撞撞地通过计算所的面试，正式成为一名“计算所人”，从此开启了科研人生，也开始认识和体会计算所的使命感。
在和国重相关的众多回忆中，有一句话反复浮现：“总要有人去做一些不同的事”。这是国重主任孙凝晖院士平日里和大家交流时对使命感的一种通俗的解读——当大多数人都去做相同的事、都去追求相同的东西时，国重要鼓励和支持有人去做一些不同的事。我是国重这种发展理念的积极响应者，也是这种理念的最大受益者之一，我的成长就是去做了不同阶段国重所鼓励的、和主流有点不同的事。
（一）
2006年以前，计算所的系统方向一直都是专注于承担龙芯、曙光这样的大项目。但从2006年起，计算所开始重视在计算机体系结构基础研究上布局。于是在2006年，国重的前身——中科院计算机系统结构重点实验室（院重）成立了。那时国内还是SCI论文盛行，时任计算所所长的李国杰院士认为不应该追求SCI论文，而是呼吁要重视在国际顶级会议上发表论文。
明确了方向和目标，大家的努力便开始逐渐起成效了：2006年、2007年先后突破了计算所第一篇SC和SPAA，2008年又突破了HotChips、SIGMETRICS、ICS，2009年顶会论文又上一个台阶（HPCA、SC、ICS、DSN、2篇CGO），2010年继续一路高歌（2篇ISCA、PLDI、HPCA、3篇CGO等）……
那段时间我也是积极响应，把发表顶会论文作为目标，也有所收获，在2008年发表了SIGMETRICS，2010年发表了HPCA，也因…</span>

While being on a steady rise for years, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased reported cases of poor mental health significantly. KFF reports that the implications of the pandemic have resulted in 4 in 10 adults reporting symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

                    <span>新晋网红店铺开了一茬又一茶，北京很少是首选，搞得饱妹经常只能眼馋上海的朋友，偷偷留下羡慕的口水泪水。


这次盼星星盼月亮，终于盼来了长沙代表队的中式点心店：虎头局渣打饼行。于是网红拔草栏目回归！跟着福桃，让你好汉不吃网红亏！





饱情提示：本文全程无广，可放心食用。
虽然饱妹买得多，架不住饱弟吃得也多啊！
（都吃完了，没浪费的意思）
和大多把选址锁定在三里屯周边的店铺不同，虎头局的北京首店选在了五棵松华熙LIVE，从五棵松地铁站B口出来，穿过“灯红酒绿”的走廊，直达五棵松华熙LIVE。





汤城小厨的广告牌如同饱妹寒冷冬日里的一盏明灯，看见它便是找到了对的方向，进入旁边的门，虎头局渣打饼行就在左手边。





饱妹到店门口的时间是工作日的10：23，店内外加起来仍排了十个人左右，跟游乐园一样的S型排队通道还未开启。





▲恰好在饱妹点单时，后面进来了一位免排队的孕妇
通道内摆放有“孕妇免排队”的标志牌，队尾有店员负责测温和扫码的工作，还有一份菜单供顾客提前了解产品。





店门口陈列着菜单中在售的点心，饱妹问过店员后得知：这些点心都不是模型，而是和售卖的点心同批出炉的产品，葡挞、盘挞和白玉卷这类原材娇弱的会每日更换，其余则是通过外貌来判断当日是否更换，展示品不会进行售卖（想到销毁有点心疼）。





饱妹观察买到手的顾客，基本都是一大袋子起步，两大袋子是标配，颇有置办年货的气势。饱妹点完单的时间是10：51，店门外开始使用S型通道进行排队，除了菜单外，还有店员在队列中分发“预点单”和为顾客提供建议，节省在点单处的时间。





▲人多时会使用的预点单
拿到点心的顾客也许是因为经历了排队和装袋的等待，都会先掏出手机给点心拍照，喜悦之情溢于言表，颧骨升天说明了一切。









▲就算戴着口罩打了码也能感受到他们的快乐
点完单可以在店的周围等…</span>

                    <span>In this blog post, we will learn how to build a TypeScript util type, that exposes all the key paths of an object, including the nested ones.
Have you ever built TypeScript function that receives a specific property of an object, by specifying the object and the path to that object&#x27;s property? Something like this:
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,
  dog:{
    name: &quot;Rex&quot;,
  }
}

function get(object: ObjectType, path: string){
  const keys &#x3D; path.split(&#x27;.&#x27;);
  let result &#x3D; object;
  for (const key of keys) {
    result &#x3D; result[key];
  }
  return result;
}

get(person, &quot;dog.name&quot;) // Rex

Well, obviously this works very well, but you aren&#x27;t taking full advantage of TypeScript! You can easily do a typo on the second argument (path) and lose some precious type with debug…</span>

                    <span>The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object&#x27;s prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.
let us look at an example

let person &#x3D; {};

person.name &#x3D; &quot;David&quot;;
person.age &#x3D; 45;

person.eat &#x3D; function() {
console.log(&#x60;person is eating&#x60;);
}

Here we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.

When you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.
So the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.
When a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:
Returns undefined (if you tried to access a property).
Throws an error (if you tried to call a method).</span>

                    <span>The bundler configuration for a Chrome Extension can be pretty complex. When I started making Chrome Extensions, they were small projects for clients who wanted to automate a task. I was starting a new Chrome Extension almost every week, and it took too much time to configure a new project. Then I thought, &quot;We already have a manifest; why do we need more config files?&quot;
That&#x27;s the idea behind rollup-plugin-chrome-extension, also known as RPCE. My name is Jack Steam, and I&#x27;ve been hard at work over the last few months adding Vite support to RPCE. So today, I&#x27;m excited to invite you to try out RPCE with Vite.
RPCE makes it easy to set up a Chrome Extension project with a modern development experience. How easy? Let me show you.

Branding yourself online has become increasingly important as landing a role in the tech industry is constantly getting more competitive. If you want to freelance, creating a personal brand is the absolute best way to land roles, but it’s still important for those of us looking to gain more traditional roles. Creating a strong online presence that is clearly branded will help employers and clients understand exactly what you can do for them. It will also create a strong sense of skill and authenticity, as well as display your communication skills. Plus, it’s a great way to network.
So what exactly goes into creating a personal brand? The good news is that you don’t need to be a marketing expert to accomplish this, you just need to spend a bi…</span>

We’re going to expand our application so that it provides the same RESTful HTTP API as a json-server.
We’re not going to deeply examine Fielding&#x27;s definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn&#x27;t RESTful. Instead, we’ll take a simplified view and concern ourselves with how RESTful APIs are understood in web applications.
One convention is to create the unique address for resources by combining the name of the resource type with the resource&#x27;s unique identifier.

                    <span>What is a Linked List?


Linked List is a fundamental and linear data structure which is known for it&#x27;s high performance on insertion &amp; deletion. It is commonly used as a building block in other data structures like Queues, Graphs and Trees. With that, we can also say Linked List is an important step to understand these data structures - as well as building custom ones.
There are different variations of Linked Lists: Singly Linked List (or we just say Linked List unless it is specified), Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List, and more. For more details on variations, take a look at the Wikipedia page: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
Among variations, Singly and Doubly Linked Lists are the most common ones. In this article we will be focusing on Singly Linked Lists.

                    <span>Improving performance is an art. To me, chasing performance issues feels like it flexes the same muscles as debugging. You&#x27;re wading into the unknown with only a sliver of information. But instead of understanding why it does that one weird thing, you&#x27;re asking adjacent questions: Where is it slow? Why is it slow? Then of course, How can it be improved?
This post will be the first in a series outlining how I approach improving performance, specifically for laggy UIs built with React. Even though this will mention tools and techniques specific to React, a fair amount of this would transfer to general-purpose optimization work. No matter the environment or tools, I&#x27;m trying to answer the same questions.

                    <span>The field of Machine Learning has become an extremely hot topic, both in academia and in industry. Its far-reaching applications include autonomous vehicles, smart home technology, Speech-to-Text APIs and software, fraud detection, streaming service recommendations, image recognition, and much more.
As more advances are made in Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, expect these applications to become even more far reaching and ingrained into our everyday lives.
This post looks at some of the top Machine Learning conferences planned for 2022. 2021 saw the return of some in-person conferences, though most remained hybrid in-person/virtual events at the very least. Expect this trend to continue in 2022 as well.
This list of conferences includes the highly technical, li…</span>

                    <span>As I decided to create my blog I choose Next.js as my framework of choice, as a backend I use markdown files stored in a git repo. 
To render my files I use React Markdown. It&#x27;s an awesome component that can render markdown files without any config.
After a few posts, I figured out that I need some custom components rendered with my posts. One was for images, to make them zoomable for phones and the second one was a syntax highlighter for code snippets. 
React has a huge amount of components that can help us with both of these. I decided to use  react-zoom-pan-pinch for image zoom and react-syntax-highlighter for syntax highlight.
Ok. I have my components, not how to render them from our markdown files. Fortunately, React Markdown has us covered. It allows us to do a custom rendering of so…</span>

                    <span>Vagrant, topluluk tarafından fazla bilinmese de aslında tıpkı Docker gibi bir sanallaştırma aracı. Ancak tabii ki Docker&#x27;dan daha eski ve aralarında temel olarak ayrışmış farklar var.
Bunlardan en bilineni, Docker sistem ve ağ servislerinin kullanımında geride kalırken Vagrantın tıpkı yeni bir sanal makineymiş gibi bu servisleri de beraberinde getirerek tamamen gerçekçi test ortamları sağlaması.
Örneğin test ederken çeşitli sistem servislerini görüntülemeniz gereken bir yazılım geliştiriyorsanız, Vagrant sizin için bulunmaz bir nimetken Docker biraz daha geri planda kalıyor.
Bu yazıda da Docker&#x27;dan daha yavaş çalışan, daha çok kaynak kullanan ancak gerekli durumlarda bir kahramana dönüşen Vagrant&#x27;ın en çok kullanılan sunucu dağıtımlarından biri olan Ubuntu 20.04 üzerine nasıl kurulacağında…</span>

                    <span>每年的下半年是各种考试的密集区——对于学生党来讲是一年之中的大考，考个好分数，开心好过年；而对于职场人来讲，下半年，各类的专业技术能力考试与职业资格考试充斥，而且不少公司内部也有各种形式的让人开心的内部测验。
但凡是场考试，基本上都是绕不过去的。只有考和考，这样一个选项，所以备考的功课多多少少是要做的。
然而工作了之后，每天真正能够用于学习的时间却是非常少的。而当有了结婚生子之后，可利用的时间又会在非常少的基础之上，再度减少。做点属于自己的事情就要见缝插针。
针对这样的情况，结合我自身的经历，我对自己学生时代的备考方法进行一下调整，在备考过程中用起来还不错。我就把它整理了一下，于是就有了这篇分享。这当中的部分做法不仅可以用在备考之中，也可以用于其他笔记记录。
我的方法主要包括两部分，一是基于 A4 稿纸基础之上的笔记整理，另一个是基于错题整理基础之上的知识体系重构。
我整理的一本备考笔记，类似的我还有好几本
关于考试与测验
我们日常参加的各种考试一般分为两种：一种是测试过关能力测试，一种是选拔人头。感兴趣的可以去了解效标参照性标准体系与常模参照性指标体系。
为了便于理解，这里举个栗子。老师组织了一场考试，60 分及以上视为合格，分数最高的人可以获得一等奖。这里「60 分及以上视为合格」就是属于前者，完成通关任务就行；而「一等奖」这种大事一般来讲只会有一个人，无论难易。听到规则之后，每个人都会根据自身的情况进行评判并作出相应的决策，或是稍微躺平，或是努力奋斗。
讲这个的主要目的其实就是，我们的时间与精力是有限的，对于那些属于过关类的考试不要全部押宝上去，合理分配，以实现相对最优的投入产出比。
考试，不管是四六级考试、研究生考试，还是职业资格考试、专业技术资格考试（职称考试）都会有各种各样的辅导班。不少人也会去选择报名这样的辅导班。当然无论辅导班是否对自己的考试有助力，最终的考…</span>

                    <span>Windows 11 带来了全新的视觉、听觉体验和不少令人耳目一新的功能。不出所料的是，这些更新还搀杂了各种全新的 Bug 和特性。当然这似乎是一种潮流：几家科技巨头都热衷于在发布会和宣传片上炫耀新功能，却留下各类恼人的 Bug 或「特性」供开发人员修复到猴年马月。更何况 Windows 只占微软整体收入一小部分，市场中又没有任何产品足以与之竞争，指望微软官方短时间内有动力提供更好的系统体验太过不切实际。
不过使用 Windows 时的遇到诸多不顺自有应对之道。如果你苦恼于莫名宕机的开始菜单，存在感极强但作用不大的 Teams 和小组件，亦或者愤满于微软高筑的软件迁移门槛，那么下面的这些技巧或许能帮助到你。部分技巧同样适用于 Windows 10。
通过文件和链接类型更换默认浏览器
是的，更换默认浏览器竟然再次成为了需要拿出来说的东西。
如果你是从 Windows 10 升级到 Windows 11，那么你的浏览器设置将会被保留。而如果你的 Windows 11 为全新安装，现在想从 Edge 切换到其他的浏览器，在目前（22000.348）版本中，你会发现原来的「默认程序」界面不再提供切换默认浏览器功能。这显然是为了提高用户从 Edge 迁出的门槛。

现版本如果想要切换某浏览器为默认，需要更多的步骤。假设我们想要将 Liberwolf 设定为默认浏览器，需打开设置面板，进入 应用 &gt; 默认应用 &gt; Liberwolf，将 .html、.htm、HTTP 和 HTTPS 四个条目设置为 Liberwolf。

微软的这种举动倒逼部分厂商做出回应。从官网下载的 Firefox 用户目前可直接的浏览器设置中将 Firefox 设置为默认。Windows 应用商店中 Firefox 则无此功能。

                    <span>和 Android 系统一样，很多 Android 应用也会选择将源码进行开放，一方面供开源社区对代码进行审查保证安全性，另一方面也能「集思广益」，经其它开发者之手发展、演变出更多有意思的代码分支和功能。
更重要的是，因为源码人人可获取，当这些应用的商店版本（如 Play 商店）因为各种原因更新缓慢，或原始分支不再维护时，我们也可以直接绕过商店、借助源码编译「原汁原味」的最新版本。
本文就为大家介绍一种相对简单、能够自给自足的 Android 应用编译方法。
自己编译应用需要哪些工具？
要想编译 Android 项目，首先我们就先来看看项目源码的一般目录结构，了解我们需要一些什么样的编译工具。

编程语言：2021 年 Android 项目主要支持的编程语言是 Java 和 Kotlin。两者语言都是运行在 JVM 环境中，都需要各自的编译器 javac 和 kotlinc 把源码编译为 JVM 的字节码。
包管理器：Android 项目常见的包管理器是 Gradle，它负责管理和下载项目的第三方依赖，并且构建出可安装运行的 Android 安装包 (apk)。
开发套件：开发套件在图中是一个隐藏的依赖 —— Android SDK 。在大部分的平台架构上开发 GUI 程序，基本绕不开平台的 SDK。
至此，我们了解清楚了我们所需要的工具，那么下一个问题就是从哪里获取这些工具。
传统编译方法比较麻烦在哪里？
传统的办法编译 Android 项目是下载 Android Studio 集成开发环境，作为一个 IDE 它包含了上述所需要的全部的工具，但是它也有以下的弊端：

从 Android Studio 下载指定的 Android SDK 版本也还需要一定的步骤
Android Studio 自带的 Java 版本较新，不一定能编译通过旧代码
Gradle 下载依赖的时候由于…</span>

Android 12L Beta 1 发布

本周，Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本已经发布，但其实 Android 12L 对于大部分 Android 爱好者其实也都不算太陌生：毕竟如果你有仔细看周报的话，上一次提到 Android 12L，大家想到的可能都是关于 Google 折叠屏手机项目（又称 Pixel Fold）搁浅的新闻。

 
但作为 Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本，我们还是可以借此了解更多 Android 12L 中的新特性：毕竟除了面向大屏/高 DPI 显示所做的优化之外，Android 12L 本身也有「Android 12.1」这一另一层含义，因此也包括一些对于原生 Android 12 使用体验上的改进。

在 UI 细节上，Android 12L 为了应对大屏使用，类似壁纸设置 UI 等二级菜单都采用了浮窗而非先前的全屏设计，最近应用页面中的「清除所有应用」按钮也加上了 Android 12L 风格的圆角矩形边框，很多 UI 操作细节都变得更加顺滑自然；符合 Android 12 整体对于 UI 动效的调整风格。触觉反馈的调整也更加柔和，这些本身都是 Pixel 系列的强项，Android 12L 中只是进一步优化了体验细节。

另外，在 Android 12 正式版中没有的投…</span>

                    <span>Most people tend to prioritize choosing the best CPUs and the best graphics card over anything else while building a PC. The decision of picking the best PC case is often overlooked and is usually considered an afterthought. While the core components like the CPU, GPU, motherboard, etc. are important for the build, we think

                    <span>这个原因其实非常简单：
如果你看过2017年，ssg夺冠之路，我相信你也会非常喜欢这支队伍。
如果各位刚好有时间，我就凭记忆回顾一下S7都发生了什么，然后你就明白为什么管泽元（包括我）喜欢ssg，喜欢crown了
本身2017年我也是全年在看LCK，一场不落，而管泽元也经常去解说lck的比赛。我们都见证并经历了SSG的传奇！（这个教练非常厉害 ，还有替补haru是狮子狗本命，据说只拿狮子狗上王者，后来我记得很多lck比赛他拿狮子狗必赢的，这就叫本命英雄）

三星是S7的3号种子，可以说是从悬崖下又爬上来的，一路过关斩将，拿到了最后一个名额，为了拿这个名额，不容易，都是劲敌，但时间久远，我忘了都是什么队了，反正都很厉害。
补充：鉴于很多朋友比较关心，我查询并记起了当年ssg拿三号种子的大致过程。
2017年的lck是SSG，AFS，MVP三支队伍打冒泡赛，其中的胜者再和kt打，才能获得最后一个名额。
当时LZ一号种子，SKT二号种子。然后ssg赢了afs和mvp中的胜者后（我印象中好像是afs赢了），还要和kt再打才有资格拿到三号种子。而kt众所周知是当时的银河战舰，看看这豪华阵容：
smeb是当时世界第一上单，即便在s8也能按着duke杀，和巅峰the shy打得有来有回。打野score是老牌野王了，中路是刚从edg回去的佛祖pawn将军，下路飞行员deft+号称最强大脑的曾获得S4世界冠军的fmvp获得者mata。当时kt还有个笑话，叫LPL三杰，意思是：从LPL回来的三个都是菜逼（pawn，mata，deft），全靠smeb和老队长在c

再看看afs有多强？SKT刚拿下三冠，风头正盛，lck也是当之无愧第一赛区，而当时afs是全世界对skt胜率最高的队伍！比抗韩奇侠闪电狼还高不少！我记得那年春季赛afs遇到skt基本没输过，把我看蒙了，心想马大头打老东家是真滴狠。

                    <span>最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。

与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。

虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。



游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。



《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。
最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。
说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。

虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。

Let&#x27;s face it. You can&#x27;t do everything. Or at least not efficiently in time. And time is one of the most valuable resources you have. That&#x27;s why many founders will tell you to find a co-founder for your idea. In most cases a mix of technical and sales based skillset would be very helpful. 
Since I work as a developer, it seems easy to find someone else with a technical background. And that&#x27;s how I met your... my co-founder.
There probably are a ton of todo apps out there. And thats okay. Everyone has its own preferences and tastes when choosing a new product. In many cases you will use the most famous product which seems to solve 80 % of t…</span>

                    <span>Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. 
Our mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future. Join our platform to learn more about what opportunities Interniac can offer you!

                    <span>BY NOW, most of the internet knows about the famous Log4Shell exploit, and if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s easy to get a sense of how disastrous it&#x27;s been. To drive the point home: the US Department of Homeland Security is warning people about it.
There&#x27;s been a lot of hand-wringing about how open source software, the lifeblood of many businesses today, is often totally unpaid and unthanked work, with some hot takes like &#x27;Open source needs to grow the hell up.&#x27; and &#x27;Open source&#x27; is broken.
What I want to touch on is something that&#x27;s been bothering me for the past few days, and solidified after seeing Bloomberg&#x27;s piece–the fact that the log4j developers had this massive security issue dumped in their laps, with the expectation that they were supposed to fix it. How did that happen? How did a group of sm…</span>

                    <span>When dealing with SQL databases, users will have to interact with different data types and schemas depending on the project&#x27;s requirements. Since databases are used in many different applications and support multiple platforms, devices, and users, there may be differences in how data is entered, even in a simple field like a phone number.
For example, one set of users will enter the phone number with the country code, while the others may simply ignore the country code. Therefore, it is essential for database users to know how to clean data in a SQL database. In this post, we will see how to utilize SQL string operations on phone number fields to properly clean, format, and extract data.
Data comes in all forms and sizes. Most of the time, it will be raw data, without proper formatting. Da…</span>

                    <span>I often read the term &quot;tutorial hell &quot; and I always wonder why so many people get stuck while I have so many ideas in my head for my own projects. Let me explain why I&#x27;ve never ended up in tutorial hell and how I come up with so many different ideas.
Of course, I watched a lot of tutorials during my learning journey, and I still do to gain more knowledge about certain things and improve my skills on a daily basis.
But even as I&#x27;m watching and following along with the tutorial, I&#x27;m already taking in the good things I could use from that tutorial in my head and thinking about how I could use them in one of my own projects.
A good example is the To Do List tutorial, which everyone seems to have enough of already. And actually, I don&#x27;t quite understand. If you watch a really good tutorial on h…</span>

                    <span>I had someone recently reach out to me to ask &quot;What is Suspense in the general sense?&quot; They said all they could find was React resources. And I told them that made sense they coined the term. But looking around I realized it was more than that.
When I look at the topic as explained in most articles it talks about the symptoms of the Suspense component but not really what it is. So I&#x27;m going to try to show today why it is so much more than a component that renders placeholders.
Consistent display of information is a fundamental expectation of a good user interface. If you show users inconsistent information within the same page(without indicating it) it erodes trust.

                    <span>To improve my Go Programming skills and become a better Go engineer, I have recently purchased an excellent on-demand education from Ardan Labs. Materials are created by an expert Go engineer, Bill Kennedy.

I have decide to record my process of learning how to write more idiomatic code, following Go best practices and design philosophies. 
This series of posts will describe channel patterns used for orchestration/signaling in Go via goroutines.
The main idea behind Drop Pattern is to have a limit on the amount of work that can be done at any given moment.

                    <span>不久前某刚到深圳的工友咨询深圳有无「正常」的披萨，就是只有番茄奶酪罗勒烤出来的，没有那些稀奇古怪顶料的简单披萨，大家推荐了许多店但几乎都不能完全满足这看似没有需求的需求。而我认为大家既然都已经是成熟的大人了，不妨自给自足？
有人戏说披萨就是中式馅饼的变种——它把馅儿给裹在了饼外面，或许是因为这个原因，以必胜客为主的中低端披萨店会给其做一些莫名其妙的改良，什么咖喱、麻辣甚至烤鸭披萨都常能见到，反而一些最基础的传统披萨被隐藏在菜单角落，并且味道也非常一般。
尝试过在家制作一次披萨后，大概猜到那些莫名其妙的「创意披萨」或许并不全是为了迎合中式饮食的噱头，而是基础披萨虽然制作简单并且食材普通，但它却非常需要耐心——而这往往是普通披萨店成本最高的地方。所以我想通过这篇文章和你分享如何在家自制披萨，我想你应该能学会，而我相信当你吃过这块「一点都不快」的披萨之后，再也对街边的披萨店提不起任何兴趣。
哪种披萨最好吃
当看到我说「在家自制披萨」时，想必你一定满头问号——做什么披萨？且不论前文提到出现在国内各个快餐店里稀奇古怪的创意披萨，就算是所谓的「传统披萨」，也分为美式披萨和意式披萨两大流派，再往下根据不同国家不同城市的流行饮食文化还演变出了各式各样的风味披萨，我不知道这世上有没有字面意思上「吃过所有披萨」的人，但我估计我这辈子都做不到。
所以在知道披萨种类其实非常丰富之后，我也和你一样问过同样的问题：哪种披萨最好吃？而现在其实我和工友一样只喜欢「正常披萨」，也就是那不勒斯披萨。
那不勒斯披萨从某种意义上你可以把它理解为意大利披萨的一种，它起源于意大利的那不勒斯，并且是受到了意大利官方承认和保护的饮食，类似于我们常听到的「非物质文化遗产」。而在 1984 年成立的「那不勒斯披萨认证协会（ACPN, Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana）」更是把那不勒斯披萨推…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 12 月 2 日，群晖在线上举办了名为 Synology 2022 AND BEYOND 的在线活动，和去年类似，由于疫情等诸多原因，群晖依旧选择在线上举办其发布会，相比去年 2021 年的发布会，群晖在本次线上发布会上介绍了未来的诸多软硬件更新内容，例如 DSM 7.1、C2 云服务、SRM 1.3 等，当然还正式发布了两款硬件产品，那么下面我们一起来回顾下本次线上发布会的诸多亮点和更新吧。
DSM 7.1
在过去的 2021 年，群晖正式发布了近年来其 DSM 操作系统最大的一次版本更新：DSM 7.0。全新的外观、更为安全的访问以及诸多系统新特性使得群晖 NAS 在更可靠安全的同时，也变得更为易用。而在 2022 年，群晖还会基于 DSM 7.0 推出其首个功能更新：DSM 7.1，主要聚焦在以下几个使用痛点上：
管理大规模部署
在 DSM 7.0 中，群晖发布了基于共有云的 web 端监控平台 Active Insight，你可以通过这个平台有效地了解到你的 NAS 设备的运行情况，而在 DSM 7.1 中，Active Insight 将会得到进一步的增强，比如说你可以用它来对多台设备进行大规模的集约化部署，统一管理系统更新和套件软件的更新。

同时在 Active Insight 还整合了更为智能的验证系统，可以根据使用习惯还预测并判断潜在的可疑登录，尤其是当登录地点和时间变得异常或者所有用户账户突然变成活动状态时，会及时通知 Active Insight 的管理员，并提供相对应的操作建议。

另外 Active Insight 还将加入监控 Hyper Backup 备份任务，这样对于需要管理多台设备的管理员，可以在一个界面下集中管理而无需手动检查每一台设备。进一步减少检查和管理的工作量。
带外管理功能
这项功能将基于现有运维人员操作的基础上来进…</span>

                    <span>在国内定制系统几乎都已经经历过一轮变革的 2020 年年底，横空出世的 OriginOS 虽然难免给人一种「来晚了」的感觉，彼时它所交出的答卷依然让人惊喜，而如果站在现在的角度去看当时的 OriginOS，则不难发现它在启动器布局、桌面微件（widget）和自定义风格上的改造思路和实现路径甚至还有那么几分预见性：桌面微件在 iOS 和 Android 生态内重新得到重视、个性化表达在 Android 12 中成为一大主题……
OriginOS 对启动器主屏的重构令人印象深刻
2021 年，华容网格、原子组件、变形器，这几个在 OriginOS 中让人眼前一亮并迅速成为堪称 vivo 手机标志性功能的特性，又将迎来哪些打磨和创新？
12 月 9 日刚刚亮相的 OriginOS Ocean，就像它跳出常规「版本号」框架的命名方式那样，又一次在定制系统阵营中吹起了这么一阵新风。
玩转「符号」，将系统做成一本杂志
对去年少数派发布的 OriginOS 评测还有印象的朋友，应该知道 OriginOS 当初在大刀阔斧改造 vivo 手机系统桌面启动器的同时，也留下了不少让人担心的小问题，其中最明显的自然是系统整体设计风格上的割裂：华容网格和原子组件构建的新体验需要大量的第三方适配进行支撑、变形器虽然做得非常细致但依然没有处理好一些设计细节、启动器之外的其它部分缺少与之配位的打磨和润色……
关联阅读：OriginOS 上手体验：三个概念与它们所对应的问题
归根结底，虽然 OriginOS 在华容网格、原子组件等概念上极具巧思，但它们需要一套能够将整个 OriginOS 统一起来的设计语言。在我看来，这正是 vivo 在 OriginOS Ocean 中引入符号化设计语言的原因。这套符号化设计语言的理念源自杂志，参考对象的选择依然很巧妙——和大部分需要仔细阅读、浏览的内容相似，用排版设计的…</span>

背景概述
每次我想打盹儿的时候，几乎百分百会被媳妇的电话闹醒，但是困的时候老是忘记提前给媳妇打招呼，然后就被一阵巨大的响铃给震醒，导致不愉快。很多时候连勿扰模式也忘记开，还会被其它骚扰电话和钉钉电话闹醒。
最近研究了一下 iOS 15 推出的专注模式，结合日常生活场景做了这么个快捷指令，顺便把制作方法分享一下。
功能场景说明：运行后，手动选择计划小憩时长 30 分钟或其它时长，同时设置一个 30 分钟闹钟，发送一段文字内容通过短信和微信的方式通知给媳妇，时间到了自动结束小憩专注模式，顺便响起闹钟。

懒得看文章的可以快速自取 ：我要小睡一会儿

快捷指令
一个女朋友及其手机号码和微信好友

配置过程
设置专注模式
所有 app 都不允许通知，所有设备之间共享，就是包括 Mac 电脑以及 Apple Watch 都同步状态。

选项配置，连三分钟内第二个来电都要禁止，因为前些年用手机号注册过法人，日均十个各类骚扰电话，打不通他们大概率还会再打一次，所以必须关闭。

快捷指令取变量做信息
整体逻辑就是，打开的时候选择想要小憩的时长，然后自动化其它操作。所以，第一部分就是选择时长的指令，这块也能自己改成一个手动输入项目，选择自己想睡的时长。

然后，需要两个在短信通知中发送给媳妇的重要变量——从 X 点睡到 Y 点，即通知超过这个时间之后电话才可以被打通。
通过「日期」脚本就能获取实时时间，通过「调整日期」就可以把时间修改为结束小憩的时间。通过一个「文本」脚本即可把两个关键变量和信息文案进行整理。

注意在时间变量可以按下图配置一下，这样就可以把冗余的日期信息去除了，短信内容结果呈现就是 xx:xx。

消息发送
第一个「信息发送」脚本就不多说，第二个「微信发送」在 Mac 端是不支持的，操作方法是在手机端先用 Siri 喊一句：

微信发送「要说的话」给「具体对象名字」。

Siri 这么操作成功一次之后，在快捷指令的脚本建议里面就自动出来了可选项，然后按「信息发送」脚本一样操作即可。

其它自动化
这部分就用默认的脚本选择专注模式结束时间，以及创建闹钟基础脚本即可。

心得体会及踩坑
Mac 端和 iOS 端的脚本还是存在一些割裂和 bug，例如我在 iOS 上设置了微信发送，在 Mac 端打开了一下工程文件，手机上再打开就会默认变成了企业微信发送消息，企业微信好友没有媳妇微信然后就报错了（那说明也可以用企业微信定时来给真领导发送汇报了）。

Mac 端无法直接使用闹钟脚本，搜半天发现压根就不在候选里面，微信和企业微信也是没法直接搜到的。

                    <span>3 年前，Apple 发布了 Apple Watch Series 4，升级了更大显示屏的同时，也带来了心电图功能。然而，国行版本的手表却与它无缘 —— 倒不是说硬件不支持，而是在软件上需要适配及审核。
直到今天，Apple 在最新的 iOS 15.2 和 watchOS 8.3 系统中，终于将过审已久的心电图功能带到国行 Apple Watch 上。除了心电图之外，iOS 15.2 其实还有不少值得关注的功能，一起来看看吧。
国行 Apple Watch 支持心电图
盼望着，盼望着，心电图终于来了。只要你的手表是 Apple Watch S4 及之后的款式，在升级了 watchOS 8.3 和 iOS 15.2 之后，就可以在 iOS 设备的「健康 &gt; 浏览 &gt; 心脏」中打开它。稍等一会，Apple Watch 上便会出现心电图 App。
如果你先前已经通过各种方式开通了心电图功能，更新后不会受到影响。

要使用心电图也很简单，只需佩戴好手表后打开心电图 App，将另一只手的食指放在数码表冠上，30 秒之后就能完成检测，同时检测结果也会即时同步到 iOS 设备的健康 App 中。你可以在健康 App 中将心电图导出为 PDF 文件提供给医生作为参考。
不过需要重点注意：Apple Watch 并非专业医疗设备，心电图检测的结果只能参考，不能用于诊断心脏病等疾病。如果对检测的结果有疑问或有身体不适，还是尽快咨询医生为好。

另外值得一提的是，此次国行 Apple Watch 的心电图功能，全称为「移动心电图房颤提示软件」，且软件版本为 V1，支持检测正常心率下的房颤。而目前最新的软件版本为 V2，除了支持 V1 版本的功能外，还能够检测高心率下的房颤。

Apple 推送一系列正式版系统更新
12 月 14 日，Apple 开始向旗下产品推送新一轮正式版系统。
iOS/iPadOS 15.2 新增了 Apple Music 声控方案，还包括了「App 隐私报告」与 Apple ID「数字遗产」等功能。iPhone 13 Pro 与 iPhone 13 Pro Max 用户现在可以在设置中启用微距照片控制，用于切换到超广角镜头拍摄微距照片与视频。iPadOS 15.2 允许用户将快速备忘录的触发角改为左下角。此外还包括一系列功能与错误修复。
macOS Monterey 12.1 正式上线 SharePlay 功能，并修复了播放 HDR 视频可能导致崩溃、MagSafe 充电失灵等问题。值得一提的是「通用控制」再次延期，未能在该版本上线。此外，Apple 为老机型推送了 macOS Big Sur 11.6.2 以及 macOS Catalina 安全更新 2021-008，该补丁修复了一个可以绕过 macOS 安全机制的重大问题。
HomePod 15.2 软件更新增加了荷兰语及俄语 Siri，并支持新推出的 Apple Music 声控方案。
watchOS 8.3 除隐私报告与声控方案等更新外，还带来了此前获批的 ECG 功能。Apple Watch Series 4 及以后的机型（除 Apple Watch SE 外）现可使用移动心电图房颤提示软件，单通道心电图波形与相关分类及症状都会记录在「健康」App 中。来源

                    <span>便利店无美食推荐指南
比如总是被“夸”的便利店便当


好像大家对便利店盒饭总是有莫名的期待
而全家、711、罗森的便当，鸡腿、猪排、意面…
从外表看，确实让人很有食欲


这么多肉，却只卖十几块
花很少的钱，就能吃饱又吃好



“世界上竟然有这种好事儿”
当这个想法出现时
故事的走向一般都是
“果然没有这种好事儿”



2年多前，胖崽做过一次全家便当的差测评
这次我又用了大概一周的时间
吃了全家所有的便当



你们觉得这些好看的便当皮囊下
有几款藏着“好吃”的灵魂


西式口味饭

芝士猪排咖喱饭、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭、黑椒香煎猪排饭
这三款饭，无论名字还是卖相
看上去，都觉得真香
…
但眼见就一定为实吗
那我追过的cp，就不会怎么看都真的是爱
实际却根本不存在



1、芝士猪排咖喱饭

13块8
与2年前比，猪排口感有进步
虽然同样比较干，但更像“肉”了
味道依然完全不像肉，吃出了点咸味



猪排勉强能吃，咖喱真的难吃
全家，你是在画咖喱吗
颜色像咖喱，味道跟咖喱根本不相关
吃起来很奇怪，味道很复杂
有点点奶，有点点咸，完全不下饭



2、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭

15块8
这个皮，感觉应该烤箱再烤20分钟
而不是微波炉加热就能吃
唉，这是鸡腿皮，又不是脸皮
为什么我也想不要呢



本来鸡腿够大，还有甜味香肠
这款饭吃起来还挺饱，挺满足
但，饭里又加了同款怪味咖喱
这个咖喱吃起来的感觉
真的让我误会是不是加了恒河水
复杂、一言难尽



3、黑椒香煎猪排饭

12块8
啊，这猪排，真的成了精
我这凡人之躯，确实感受不出猪的原型
不知道自己在吃什么肉



但粉丝跟豆角味道还算正常
有蛋味跟油味的煎蛋
是全家盒饭里，最好的荤菜



中式口味饭

西式的饭不太行，吃吃看中式口味



1、香冒肥牛饭

14块8
来，你们看看这片肉
隔着屏幕，吃不到，是不是很难受
那我们感同身受
…
因为我看着这片肥牛
却也吃不出肥牛的味道



味道偏辣
对于广东胃来说，是非常辣
比较下饭吧



2、孜然牛肉鸡排双拼饭

奥尔良鸡肉、孜然牛肉、蛋皮、甜洋葱、胡萝卜…
聚在一起，什么都有
然后，每一款都做得不怎么样
这不是盒饭，是饭堂
即使只卖15块8，我也觉得不值



烩饭

烩饭是全家新款便当
一盒13块8
两款都比较清淡


菌菇鸡肉烩饭

味道像清鸡汤味的浓汤宝


番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭

基本就是微微的酸味
可以吃吧



面
吃完了饭，我们来吃面
一共吃了5款
包含意面、拌面、泡面、不知道什么面

其实都不用说出口
煮好，冷藏，微波炉再加热吃的面条
这是做好了，等ta，等到冷掉的饭菜
确实热热还能吃，但就是吃得不开心啊
所有的面条口感都很糟糕，大部分很软





1、奥尔良风味鸡肉意面

11块8
这盒面，要上天



“您好，这是本次航班配送的餐食”



完全就是经济舱鸡肉意面的样子跟味道
鸡肉就是飞机餐鸡肉口感
调味酸酸甜甜
只有翱翔在蓝天，才愿意下咽



2、大块鸡排京味炸酱干拌面

11块8
本来炸鸡排的口感应该是：说出“我喜欢你”前一刻的心跳
热切，跳个不停
用微波炉翻热的炸鸡排
…
是听到“对不起”后一刻的心跳
心如死灰的静
…
完全不香
京味炸酱就吃出了咸


3、港式餐蛋捞丁

这11块8，花得不值
午餐肉，薄到，我都害怕
它会从我的牙缝溜走
…
唯一的优点是捞丁用的酱
有蒜蓉，所以味道没那么单调



4、黑椒牛肉炒意面

只要9块8
所以买不了吃亏买不了上当
诶诶诶，想啥呢
不该花的钱一分不能花
这盒面，很干，还只吃出黑胡椒的冲辣



5、黑椒牛柳拌面

最好，也最贵，13块8
虽然主要也是黑胡椒味
但酱汁拌匀后，面条比较湿润，口感会好一些




总 结
分量来说，全家的盒饭
大部分一个都吃不饱



非要选的话，如果旁边没有超市快餐
饭我选番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭
面的话，嗯，不如选便利店里的车仔面


最后，发自内心地说
其实全家的便当非常适合我吃
因为社畜，就该吃些非人的食物




这次重测，一大原因是上次测评发出后的回应，让那篇测评可以归入“我找骂系列测评”。
所以这期，我先“反击”



以上纯味道评价，你可以认为好吃，但别用“加班后深夜的全家”等附加情感因素反驳我；
因为用“感情”反击，从“道理”上，就已经输了

                    <span>记者从退役军人事务部了解到，退役军人事务部近日正式印发《退役军人、其他优抚对象优待证管理办法（试行）》（以下简称《优待证管理办法》）。
《优待证管理办法》指出，为规范退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象优待证（简称优待证）制发、使用和服务管理，维护持证人权益，提高优待服务管理水平，依据《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》和国家有关规定，制定本办法。
《优待证管理办法》明确，优待证分为“中华人民共和国退役军人优待证”、“中华人民共和国烈士、因公牺牲军人、病故军人遗属优待证”两种，分别面向符合条件的退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象发放。优待证是持证人彰显荣誉的载体、享受优待的凭证。
据了解，2020年1月，退役军人事务部等20部门联合印发《关于加强军人军属、退役军人和其他优抚对象优待工作的意见》，提出“建立优待证制度”，逐步为退役军人和“三属”（烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属）统一制作颁发优待证。2021年1月1日起施行的《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》，将国家发放优待证写入法律。
《优待证管理办法》共9章、52条，3个部分。第一部分为总体要求，包含第一、二章，共16条。明确了优待证制发的目的依据、相关定义、适用范围、工作原则、信息支持、职责分工、功能等。
第二部分为优待证各个环节的工作要求，包含第三至八章，共32条。明确了申请、审核、制发、补换、收回、监督管理等全周期过程的要求。
第三部分为附则，即第九章，共4条。明确了遗属界定、施行时间等。（人民网记者何淼）

                    <span>一证虽小，意义非凡！！
自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。
因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。
退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： 
一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇
当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。
退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。

在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。
但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。

二、光荣的象征
 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。
 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。
对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。
三、身份的证明
 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。
 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。
 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。
四、全国通用
近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。
而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。
不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 
退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。

而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！

The Marvel Phase 4 Film starring Tom Holland (Peter Parker), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Doc Ock (Doctor Octopus Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Sandman, &amp; The Lizard.

Nicolas Cage stars as... Nick Cage in the action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones. With a career built for this very moment, the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nick Cage.</span>

The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the universe seems empty. Devoid o…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched! And I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to come up with a game plan for where the Multiplayer should be headed from here on out. This is more or less, what I think 343i should do and prioritize for the next... however long. So check the time stamps if there&#x27;s something in particular you want to see me talk about.

                    <span>Data Structures and Algorithms are a very important topic for every beginner programmer to learn about. 
Data structures and algorithms are two terms that are often mentioned in the same sentence. In a data structure, you will find the different types of data, such as arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, and trees. What exactly are they? How do they work? How can you use them to solve real-world problems? 
To answer these questions, this article will provide 8 types of data structures and algorithms that you might encounter in your everyday life. The article starts by giving the basics for each data structure or algorithm before explaining its function. As an example for each type of data structure or algorithm, we’ve included a brief case study where it has been used.

                    <span>Context


This post is a short made-up, based on a real experience. It aims to show different approaches to developing and maintaining React components in an application.
In order to use react-select in a french government project, we have to translate placeholders and other default options. As far as I know, there is no i18n extension for react-select; anyway, it may not have fit our need since there may be some domain-specific text. Here we go, let&#x27;s use the component&#x27;s props:
 &quot;Chargement…&quot;}
  noOptionsMessage&#x3D;{() &#x3D;&gt; &quot;Aucun résultat&quot;}
  placeholder&#x3D;&quot;Choisissez une valeur&quot;
  // …
/&gt;

It works. 
👉 Now, we want to re-use this component with same options elsewhere, then everywhere else.
We could create a MySelect that has some default options. Since the only …</span>

                    <span>Written by Chiamaka Umeh ✏️
React Hooks provide us with access to core React functionalities within the context of function components. Traditionally, to optimize React, developers have had to switch between function and class components, however, React Hooks allow us to use function components throughout projects to build both small and large applications.
If you’re a React developer who likes to write function components over class components, then this article is for you; we’ll look at three helpful yet somewhat underrated React Hooks that you might not be so familiar with, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, and useDebugValue. We’ll explore their use cases, syntax, and a few code examples. Let’s get started!

                    <span>Vendure is a modern headless e-commerce framework written in TypeScript and built on top of the excellent NestJS framework.
By &quot;headless&quot; we mean that it exposes an API (GraphQL in the case of Vendure), which allows you to build your storefront using your favourite front-end technology, be it Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or anything else you like!
Headless e-commerce has a somewhat justified reputation of being more complex and development-intensive than off-the-shelf SaaS solutions like Shopify. But with Vendure we aim to cut down your development time to the bare minimum with a combination of:
a rich set of features
integrations with existing solutions
optimal developer experience
modern technologies and workflows

                    <span>Monads were created by mathematicians in 1960 and rediscovered by computer scientists in 1990 as a new way to handle effects. Let&#x27;s write some examples, imagine a function that gets the tail from a list like this:

The problem here is obvious, this function can fail if he receives an empty list, now imagine that for any reason we&#x27;re using this function in our program to work with lists and for some reason, it receives an empty list, in this case, our program will break and the language compiler will give to us an exception, so how to solve this? to solve this we can use the Maybe Monad, let&#x27;s write this:

Now we have the function safeTail which is total, which means that this function will never fail, even if receives an empty list. As you can see Maybe Monad is like a box that encapsulate…</span>

                    <span>Hi guys, this is my first post and I will help to install Neovim for MacOS. In this case, the plugins to install will be mostly backend development (Python and Go).
Personally, my primary motivation to try out Neovim was: 
Reducing load on my machine.
Have the experience of using Vim/NeoVim as my IDE.
To be curios about why Vim/Neovim is so special.
Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim source code to achieve the following goals:
Simplify maintenance to improve the speed that bug fixes and features get merged.
Split the work among multiple developers.
Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any modifications to the core source.
Improve the extensibility power with a new plugin architecture based on coprocesses. Plugins will be written in any pr…</span>

                    <span>As all those of us involved in the field of Computer Science know or should know, Git is by far the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. We utilized it in our everyday routine to keep track of our code changes and helps us to work with other developers simultaneously and independently. 

Although modern IDE and various tools provided by GitHub, Atlassian and other provide us an easy to use way to perform many git commands nothing compares to the power a terminal provides. Bellow you can find a list of my top git commands.
# This will pop up an editor window allowing us to pass the new commit message
git commit -amend 

# This will not pop up the editor
git commit -amend -m &quot;Your new commit message&quot;

# Add the file
git add the_file_you_want_to_add
# Amend without changing commit message
git commit --amend --no-edit

git reset --hard 

git cherry-pick 

git log -n 
# example git log -n 3
# or
git log -
# example git log -3

                    <span>In this articles I would like to share with you the process of development of the latest game that I developed called Cuzzle (cube + puzzle &#x3D; Cuzzle) ReactJS, this game was inspired by the original game called cuzzle developed by Redline Games
In this first part, I&#x27;m going to show you about the game and the different options it has.
In the second part, we are going to talk about the technical aspects and challenges in the development of this game.

You can play the game online here: https://cuzzle-react.vercel.app/
Cuzzle ReactJS is an isometric puzzle game, inspired by Sokoban, the 1981 transport puzzle game in which the player has to push boxes around a warehouse to get them into different locations. Cuzzle ReactJS add collapsing floors, switches, and some nice graphics.

                    <span>These last days, I tried to send an SMS with a Guile script.
Since the code is just a simple HTTP POST request, the longest part should have been the creation of the Twilio account (with a Regulatory Bundle and a phone number).
But in the end, it took me about one evening[1] to set up a development environment with the right dependencies, and then two more evenings to figure out which HTTP headers were needed.
Anyway, here is the script:

                    <span>Data Science is a growing field that has made it possible to extract meaningful information from data. Data scientists need programming languages in order to have the necessary tools for their job. In this blog post, we will talk about the best programming languages for data science and why they are so important!
R Language
Python
C++
Java
Wolfram Language
R, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.
Data science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code. These two languages are used by over half of all Fortune 500 companies so they&#x27;re worth getting acquainted with!

Shortery：Mac 上的快捷指令自动化工具

平台：macOS
关键词：快捷指令、自动化

@huhuhang：快捷指令作为 iPhone 上出色的效率应用，终于在今年被 Apple 带到 Mac 平台。从长期来看，快捷指令也大有替代 Mac 原本的 Automator 的趋势。当然，由于 iOS 和 macOS 平台的属性不同，快捷指令在二者中的功能也不完全一致，并非简单的移植。例如你可以从菜单栏和访达中快速访问 Mac 版本的快捷指令，同时又缺失了 iOS 版本具有的自动化功能。

虽然官方尚未在 Mac 版的快捷指令中添加自动化触发选项，但第三方应用 Shortery 正好可以弥补这点不足。

Shortery 提供了七种不同的触发器来运行快捷指令：

应用程序启动和退出：当你启动或退出一个应用程序时运行快捷指令。
时间：设置快捷指令运行的时间，并定义它的重复频率。
唤醒和睡眠：在你的 Mac 进入睡眠或醒来后运行快捷指令。
登录：用户登录时触发，开始全新的一天。
键盘：定义一个全局热键并从任何应用程序中触发它。
外观：当你的 Mac …</span>

                    <span>「互联网正在着火」？
如果你多少关注信息安全资讯，或许在最近几天已经频繁听到 Log4Shell 这个漏洞的名字——或者一些更具传播性的说法，诸如「互联网正在着火」「过去十年最严重的漏洞」「现代计算机历史上最大漏洞」「难以想到哪家公司不受影响」之类（参见《洛杉矶时报》，12 月 10 日）。

这个被报道得神乎其神的 Log4Shell 漏洞（CVE-2021-44228）所针对的，是一个极为常用的 Java 库 Log4j（详见后文说明）。值得一提，这个漏洞最初是由一名中国工程师、阿里云安全团队的 Chen Zhaojun（微博）在 11 月下旬发现并提报的。
有记录的利用 Log4Shell 漏洞发起的攻击开始于 12 月 9 日，最初是针对微软的 Minecraft 游戏 Java 版。但人们很快发现 Log4Shell 的波及范围远不止于此。根据 GitHub 仓库 YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface 中的攻击案例截图，Apple iCloud、QQ 邮箱、Steam 商店、Twitter、百度搜索等一系列国内外主流服务或平台均存在该漏洞。

好在，Log4j 已经于 12 日发布 2.15.0 版本，修复了漏洞，并且对于暂不能升级的旧版提供了临时应对方案。
受影响的大型平台也作出快速响应。10 日，Minecraft 发布 1.18.1 版，说明已修复了漏洞；亚马逊发出安全警告称，「正积极监控该问题，并已在寻求解决方案」；IBM、Red Hat、甲骨文、VMware 等知名科技公司也宣称正在部署补丁；Apple 尽管没有官方回应，但根据 11 日的测试，原本受到影响的 iCloud 似乎也已经修复。此外，目前暂无因该漏洞导致重大安全事故的报道。
然而，由于该漏洞影响范围之广，受影响服务完成更新或修补仍需不少时间，因此近期内风险仍不可忽视。事…</span>

                    <span>不论是患者还是家属，对重症监护病房（ICU）那道厚厚的门档充满了恐惧，ICU 常被描述为「有去无回」的地方，现实中的「人间地狱」。在很多人的眼里，ICU 中各种生命支持设备维持下的患者是没有「灵魂」的，ICU 的医护人员是没有「人情」的，要问整个医院中最没有人文关怀的科室，ICU 必定站上榜首。
作为一名 ICU 医生，希望能通过这篇文章，带大家一起了解现代医疗下的 ICU 是怎样的一个地方。
重症监护病房的历史
ICU 在整个现代医学的发展中属于一股新生力量，在 1950 年左右，为了拯救脊髓灰质炎导致呼吸衰竭的患者，才出现第一批具有现代医学意义上的 ICU 雏形。随着医疗技术的逐步发展，才在之后的数十年中逐步创立了重症监护病房。而中国第一个 ICU 病房则是在 1982 年于北京协和医院设立的，创建之初是只有 1 张床位的外科ICU，之后的 2 年，才创立了拥有 7 张床的 ICU 中心，从此开启了中国重症监护医学的元年。
在创立之初，由于患者需要大量的麻醉治疗、呼吸机治疗等方面的支持，ICU 大部分医生是由麻醉医生构成的，此时的ICU更多扮演着麻醉科附属科室的角色。随着 2003 年严重呼吸系统综合征 SARS、2005 年禽流感、2008 年汶川地震等重大公共卫生安全事件的相继爆发，大量危重症患者需要 ICU 的支持治疗，使得重症医学迅速发展壮大，2009 年正式认定为临床医学的二级学科，成为中国现代医学重要的组成部分。

经过接近一个月的开发工作，Switshot 2.0 版本终于正式地与大家见面。
相较于「简陋」的 Switshot 1.x 版本，Switshot 2.0 可以说是完全重构的版本。不仅在 1.x 版本中出现的诸多问题被统一修复，新版本还新增快捷指令功能，并为之后的媒体管理增强功能打下基础。
首先，介绍一下 Switshot
Nintendo Switch 11.0.0 固件更新为 Nintendo Switch 带来「发送至智能手机」功能。这个功能本质上是在 Switch 上启动一个 WLAN 热点和一个 Web 服务器，让手机连接到热点并访问服务器的资源（截屏和录制）。但是这个功能并没有想象中那么好用：除了需要扫描两次 QR 码之外，它将截屏和录制保存到手机上的方式也很原始：给你一个网页，让你长按保存……
老任啊，你这个发送功能，是来搞笑的吗？
后来，有人做了一款 Android app，可以直接读取 Switch 发送过来的媒体列表然后直接保存。对老任这个传输网页进行一点点 inspect 工作，发现 Switch 实际上会提供一个 JSON 列表，列表中包括在 Switch 中传过来的文件地址。
那么，下面就是「我上我也行」时间。我当即做了一个 快捷指令，自动读取 JSON 列表然后保存到图库。
最开始做 Switshot 非常机缘巧合：它是我做另外一款 app、等待 App Store 审核期间花半天时间摸出来的玩意，目的和上面提到的 app 和快捷指令一样：只需要扫一次码，就能一次性地把媒体保存起来。之后，我收到身边朋友…</span>

严重远程代码执行漏洞影响国内外大型公司服务
12 月 10 日，一个旧版 Apache Log4j 2 远程代码执行漏洞细节被公开。Log4j 是一个用来记录日志信息的 Java 框架，被大量项目用于业务系统开发。该漏洞利用了 Log4j 对日志内容的递归解析功能，使得攻击者无需特殊配置即可直接构造恶意请求，触发远程代码执行漏洞，漏洞利用。受到影响的服务包括微软的 Minecraft 游戏、亚马逊的 AWS 云服务多项功能，Apple iCloud 以及国内的百度搜索、QQ 邮箱等服务经测试亦受影响。

目前 Apache Log4j 官方已发布安全通告（CVE-2021-44228），并发布 Log4j 2.15.0 版本，对主要引发漏洞的 JNDI 功能强化默认安全设置，从而修复了漏洞，并针对旧版提出了补救建议，但受影响厂商完成更新或修补预计仍需时间。来源

                    <span>大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。
非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。
我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。
首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。



其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~

厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。

对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。
最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～

                    <span>如此有价值的一个问题不光没几个人答，而且先前仅有的两个回答居然都在胡说八道……这不能忍，怒答一发。
羽毛球世界杯赛的“停办”在历史上一共有两次，一次是1997-2005的暂时停办，一次就是2006年后至今的无限期永久停办，而这两次停办背后的原因其实是完全不同的。
这项赛事最初的举办是在1981年——那一年的另外一个重大历史事件就是原国际羽联IBF和原世界羽联WBF正式合并成新的国际羽联IBF（也就是现在我们熟悉的新世界羽联BWF的前身），而它的首次停办是在1997年，这期间一共举办了17次比赛，但可能出乎很多人常识认知范畴之外的是，这17次比赛的主办方其实并不是世界羽联IBF，而是总部位于美国纽约的国际管理集团IMG。

由此我们也可以得知，1997年的羽毛球世界杯赛停办，其背后的根本原因应当是由于作为主办方的IMG集团内部的业务变更与项目调整，尽管具体的情况目前已不得而知，但可以想见国际羽联对于这次停办的话语权应当不是很大的。
然而新世纪以来在湖南益阳分别于2005年和2006年举办的第18和第19届世界杯赛的情况以及世界杯赛在那之后的第二次停办，其背后的原因则与前文所述大相径庭。

首先不同于以往的是，这两届世界杯赛事的重启已经不再经过原本作为赛事主办方的IMG集团的点头，而是在当时由国际羽联IBF方面自行牵头、并同时联合我国的一些大型国有企业与地方私营企业（譬如中国移动和赛琪体育等）进行合作规划从而最终得以实现的，同时在性质上也被重新认定是不计世界排名积分的“邀请赛”——尽管从届数上这两次比赛仍按第18、19届世界杯进行顺延，也就是名义上仍继承了此前于1997年停办的老世界杯赛的衣钵，但由于整个比赛重启之后一直带着一股抹不去的“非正式赛事”的味道，因此在公众看来其在此后进行常态化办赛的前景始终是不明朗的。
其次也是最主要的一点就是这两届“新世界杯”的赛制与赛事性质的定…</span>

Usually people search for patterns to follow but some of them are searching for the anti-patterns to avoid, In my opinion both are equally important, as by knowing them you are leveling up your skills in programming using a specific tool.
To understand what are the anti-patterns we need first to define what is a pattern. a pattern is usually a well known solution for a recurring problem, or we can first talk about the concept through a food metaphor.
This plate (for people who don&#x27;t know) is a street Egyptian food called &quot;Koshary&quot;, I picked it because it has quite a lot of ingredients including rice, pasta, hummus, lentil, tomato sauce, and more.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re just getting started with data science, then Python programming is a great language to start with. It&#x27;s the most popular programming language for data scientists and it has many powerful packages, libraries and frameworks that are designed specifically for their needs. In this post, we&#x27;ll take a look at some of the best tools out there - so read on if you want to get up-to-speed quickly!
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides an efficient and comprehensive array-processing facility that can handle large multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy also contains high-level mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and other operations.

                    <span>First, create a new project.
CD into the project folder and run npm init. Follow those steps until you&#x27;re done.
Run: npm i mongodb. This will install the official MongoDB driver for Node.
Create an index.js, or main.js, depending on your main file when you ran npm init.
Inside there: add this:
const {MongoClient} &#x3D; require(&quot;mongodb&quot;);
const mongouri &#x3D; &#x27;mongodb://your_connection_string&#x27;;
const client &#x3D; new MongoClient(mongouri);

client.connect().then(console.log(&quot;Connected to MongoDB&quot;));

Congrats, if you run node ., you should see &#x27;Connected to MongoDB&#x27;.
Let&#x27;s create a quick question database by using an asynchronous function. Add this above client.connect().then(console.log(&quot;Connected to MongoDB&quot;)); and under the constants:

My player has a fraction of the functionalities a player like Youtube has, and yet I was already drowning in endless &quot;pages&quot; of events.
Next.js / React.js


Mostly because is what I&#x27;m used to... and since I&#x27;m using React, no reason not to go with Next, even though I&#x27;m not actually using anything it offers.
Chakra UI


I love the developer experience of Chakra UI. I mean... what&#x27;s more intuitive than fontSize&#x3D;{[1em&#x27;, &#x27;1.2em&#x27;, &#x27;1.5em&#x27;]} to handle breakpoint values?

                    <span>After going through the material here, you would&#x27;ve learned a lot about Blockchain and What it is all about. Let&#x27;s dive in 🚀.
A Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger network that is cryptographically secured.
Think of it as a database where different features can be built on such as coins, apps etc and no single entity has control over it. This allows for transparency, security and gives everyone full control of their assets.
We have 3 major types of networks in computing, they are:

In a centralized network, all the data and information is regulated by a single entity. Example Facebook, WhatsApp etc they are all centralized.
In a decentralized network, different nodes on the network have equally control and the source of Truth is checked on the network to ensure that everyone …</span>

                    <span>Podemos identificar padrões em uma cadeia de caracteres usando Expressões Regulares (Regular Expression ou RegEx).
Para validar o formato de um CPF, por exemplo, é necessário que esteja no seguinte padrão:
xxx.xxx.xxx-xx (cada x corresponde à um dígito decimal)
Então através de uma RegEx conseguimos identificar se esse padrão foi seguido ou não.
Usando a linguagem de programação Python, importa-se o módulo re que fornece operações de expressões regulares.
import re

Cria-se uma função validar a qual recebe uma string cpf, ela retorna válido ou inválido.
def validar(cpf):
    validador &#x3D; expressao.match(cpf)
    if validador:
        return &#x27;válido&#x27;
    return &#x27;inválido&#x27;

                    <span>For release 0.4, I decided to take the the time to participate in the 2021 GitHub Action hackathon and continue to contribute to Telescope.
About the same time we worked on integrating GitHub Continuous Integration into our SSG project, GitHub announced they are holding 2021 GitHub Action hackathon in collaboration with Dev. This year, we’re encouraged to utilize existing GitHub Actions to create workflows solutions other developers can utilize to solve problems with open source. My submission was a workflow to run code linter and formatter on only changed files and run test on only changed workspaces of a monorepo. I used what learned from building an SSG in OSD600 to build this project. After all, I walked away having a deeper understanding of GitHub actions, from exploring many existing actions, to building a useful one and publishing it to GitHub marketplace.
The other contributions were for improving website accessibility and responsiveness in Telescope. These fixed some of the minor issues I encountered while using Telescope myself.

                    <span>Do you want to perform sentiment analysis with Python but don&#x27;t know how to get started? Not to worry. In this article, I&#x27;ll demonstrate and explain how you can make your own sentiment analysis app, even if you are new to Python.
If you&#x27;ve been following programming and data science, you&#x27;ll probably be familiar with sentiment analysis. If you&#x27;re not, here the definition:
The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer&#x27;s attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
Sentiment analysis programs have become increasingly popular in the tech world. It&#x27;s time you make one for yourself!

                    <span>One of the major challenges in software engineering is documentation. After all, software is not only about code but the documentation that comes with it. It is a manual, costly process which should be human legible and comprehensible.
So why is documentation so important ? 
In this blog we will talk about some of the ways we can document code functionality in Python. 
Since Python is a dynamically typed language, coding modules for example a piece of code for a function can take any parameter values without any validations or checks. In some cases, the function name and parameters may be self-explanatory but how the parameters and function work may be unknown unless the code is read which can contain large number of complexities.Therefore having documentation on inputs and outputs of a fu…</span>

We are trying to build an alarm clock that will call users and solve a riddle. It&#x27;d not cut the call unless they got it correct. But there is a chance of saying no if they don&#x27;t want to wake up at that point. This blog will be vast if I complete the full features.

Npm (for installing packages)
Express js (For the API development) 
Ejs (templating language for HTML)
TailwindCSS (for styling)
Dasha (for making alarm clock interesting with the help of conversational AI)
Vscode (code editor)

                    <span>Windows 沙盒是内置于 Windows 部分版本中的一次性 Windows 虚拟机，它简单免费，启动速度快，并且用完即删。在需要使用不适合安装在实体机器上的应用、亦或者测试安全性未知的文件时，Windows 沙盒都是非常实用的工具。
然而，和真正的虚拟机相比，它的自定义空间「似乎」很小：沙盒默认屏蔽了摄像头和打印机，如此一来部分应用就无法运行；想要在沙盒中安装软件要么从主机复制安装包，要么再次下载；由于沙盒是一次性的，有用的文件还要在销毁沙盒前手动复制进主机……
幸运的是，以上问题都能通过专属于 Windows 沙盒的配置文件解决。Windows 沙盒配置文件为纯文本，后缀名 .wsb，可以用于定义沙盒的 vGPU 状态、网络信号、文件夹映射等属性。下文将通过三个具体实例演示配置文件的使用方法。最后一节会列出所有可用配置项供大家参考。
Windows 沙盒的开启方法请参考此文：

Windows 10 五月更新即将推送，浅色模式、沙盒和新的搜索功能都要来了

用例一：允许沙盒应用使用摄像头，临时运行视频会议应用
让我们从最简单的例子开始讲起，介绍配置文件的新建和使用流程。
假设我们需要在沙盒中运行一个视频会议软件，默认情况下，鉴于一些安全问题，沙盒屏蔽了应用对摄像头的访问。因而下面我们需要配置沙盒允许视频输入。

在桌面通过右键新建一个文本文件。确保你能看到该文件的后缀名 .txt。如果看不到，需要勾选 文件资源管理器 &gt; 查看（顶部） &gt; 显示 &gt; 文件扩展名。

双击此文件进入编辑界面。输入：

 Enable


沙盒的配置文件非常好理解，字母大小写任意，结构类似俄罗斯套娃：最外面一层   …</span>

                    <span>每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。
当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。
总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……

作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。
从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。

大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。
锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。

然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。
早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？
据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。

其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。
以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。

在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！

                    <span>The Vision, which was often carefully cleaned with flannel, had once been taken away from Arataki Itto.
But Itto has never been discouraged. On the contrary, after overcoming various hardships to regain his elemental power, his fighting spirit has burned even brighter.
Yes, that&#x27;s right. I guess his mettle is exactly what makes him the boss of the Arataki Gang.

                    <span>One thing I&#x27;ve seen across many designer/design studio websites are a cool custom cursor in place of your default computer one. Recently, I added one to my website aswell.
I had to write one from scratch (using some internet resources of course!), since all the NPM libraries I found were either outdated, or didn&#x27;t support SSR.
After adding the cursor to my own website, I had an idea to create an NPM package for it for a while. This weekend, I had some freetime from school &amp; got to work!
This library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js &amp; Remix)
Want a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak &amp; experiment around with values!
To download the library, head over to your terminal:
yarn add custom-pointer-react

Next, import the cursor component into your file &amp; customise it! Don&#x27;t forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.
import { Cursor } from &#x27;custom-pointer-react&#x27;
...
const Cursor &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    ...
    
    ...
  )
}
...
export default App

All parameters are optional, &amp; here&#x27;s a list of the different parameters which you can customise: 



Parameter
Description
Default




color
The background colour of the cursor
#000000


showRing
Controls whether to show the ring around the cursor
true


ringSize
Controls the size of the ring around the cursor
50px


cursorSize
Controls the size of the cursor
10px


ringBorder
Controls the width of the ring&#x27;s border
2px



Need help finding the right parameters? Check out the demo website!
Now, go into your app &amp; import the MouseContext provider.
import { MouseContextProvider } from &#x27;custom-pointer-react&#x27;
...
ReactDOM.render(
  
    
  ,
  document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)
)
...

Your custom cursor should be good to go!</span>

                    <span>Integrations play a huge role in communicating across different services. In this guide, we&#x27;ll build a marketing analytical dashboard with Twitter and Youtube integrations. This dashboard can be used to track stats across both platforms in a single view. 
We&#x27;re looking to build something like this 👇

We&#x27;ll be using:
React for building the frontend.
Blueprint as our UI Library
Backend template from Canonic
GraphQL for fetching the data.
React-chartjs-2 for building charts.
Step 1: Getting started with the project
To create the project, we&#x27;ll use create-react-app. Execute the command below in a terminal to create the basic boilerplate setup. We&#x27;ll name our project marketing-dashboard.
npx create-react-app marketing-dashboard

                    <span>A new commit was made to the ParseJS repository, it contains an update that will prevent smaller tokens from potentially wrongfully being placed.
This is the bug in question:
parse_string(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, [&quot;Hell&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;]);
// Produces: [Symbol(Hell), &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, ...]

// But, this--
parse_string(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hell&quot;]);
// -- produces: [Symbol(Hello), &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;, ...]

Now, in this update, the order won&#x27;t matter, the longer token is always chosen if it can be.</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t write much about Angular but as I am working on a project that uses Angular at the moment I thought why not share a thing or two that I found interesting.
As someone who is definitely not an Angular expert I was looking for a clean solution on how to listen for element events that are part of a child component&#x27;s template.
This is of course quite a trivial thing but it might be of value to people who are starting with Angular and are facing the same problem.
Let&#x27;s start.
Situation:
We want to listen to child component input element&#x27;s events inside of the parent component. (do something with it in the parent)
Parent template code: (parent.component.html)

Child template code: (child.component.html)

                    <span>Hi Devs,
This is sort of new for me. I&#x27;ve never really been a business guy - more the kind of dude that just codes away behind the scenes - but I&#x27;ve been working on a really cool project and thought it fit to show the community. We also hit #1 on Hacker News, so I figured there was a fair bit of crossover :-)
Short description
1SecondPainting is an artificial intelligence art generator that lets people create their own, stunning quality paintings in seconds.  You can then purchase canvas prints, framed posters, or digital downloads (for NFTs). Every painting sold is 100% unique - you&#x27;re in full control of your art.
I combined some pretty cutting edge ML with a proprietary post-processing pipeline to deliver probably the highest quality art of this kind (in my opinion, though of course I&#x27;m biased).
A lot of people have called it unsettling &amp; kind of scary, which I agree with! If you&#x27;re interested, you can try it for yourself here. Let me know what you think :)
Thanks,
Nick</span>

It is coded with Go and it is available on my GitHub: https://github.com/antsanchez/go-download-web 
I normally use it to: 
Back up any website (at least the rendered part of the website)
Create copies of websites for accessing them offline
It also allows you to change the URL of the downloaded website, which can be very helpful when moving an existing static website from a domain to another. 
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

                    <span>In the process of setting up the development environment for Nuvolaris, I decided to switch from virtual machines to containers, leveraging the devcontainer feature of VSCode. Then I built a Docker image that is a perfect fit for our needs: there everything is in it to build our project.
But, I almost went on panic when I realized that, since a key component is an operator, and a cli that interacts with Kubernetes, we need to be able to access a Kubernetes cluster for development FROM a container.
In my initial plans, I would have setup a cluster Kubernetes in the virtual machine itself. But now, that everything is in a container?

                    <span>故事要從 Python 的語言特性說起，因為 Python 是動態型別的，所以一個在同一個區塊（命名空間）內的變數 x，可以一下是字串，一下是整數：
x &#x3D; 4
print(type(4)) # at this moment, x points to an integer

x &#x3D; &quot;Hello, world&quot;
print(type(x)) # and at this moment, x points to a string

這樣的特性降低了 Python 的學習曲線，但在程式專案變複雜後，對於「值」與「型態」的掌握會越來越難以駕馭。
大約在 Python 3.5 起引入了 type hints，華文叫類型提示或型態提示，它讓我們得以聲明變數的型態，也可以聲明函式回傳值的型態。
有了 type hints，IDE 或是靜態分析工具就可以幫助我們偵測型態上的錯誤，也因為它只是 hints，所以它終究無法讓 Python 變成靜態型別語言，只是一種輔助而已。
下面是最基本的 type hints 範例：
name: str &#x3D; &quot;world&quot;

def greeting(name: str) -&gt; str:
    return &quot;Hello &quot; + name

greeting(name)

上面我們用 : str 聲明 name 為字串，以及在函式我們用 -&gt; str 聲明 greeting() 回傳的也是字串，當然還有更複雜的用法，可以參見〈Python Type Hints 從入門到實踐〉。
以上為前情提要，下面開始談本文的主角 Pydantic 。
Pydantic 是以 type hints 為基礎，幫我們做資料型態驗證的套件，我們可以用它定義「Model」：
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EmployeeModel(…</span>
