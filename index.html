                              <span>Spreadsheets. They are everywhere. 
Managers especially seem to love them, which is why the world properly would stop functioning without them. 
Like some twisted version of Murphy&#x27;s law, it seems that anything that can fit into a spreadsheet eventually will end up in a spreadsheet.
This can result in abominations like a Microsoft Excel database for Covid-19 results.

Well, following in the spirit of using spreadsheets other ways than intended, I thought - what if we could use a Google Sheet as a CMS?
Hold on. Hold on. Lower your pitchforks and torches - this is merely a proof of concept to see how it could work. However... there might be some use cases for this - stick around to the end to find out.

So first thing first, how do we do it in a performant way? We could set up a script to ge…</span>

                              <span>ESLint and Prettier are pretty much the two most popular tools when it comes to doing code analysis and formatting in a developers codebase. They are extremely good at what they do which is why they tend to be an essential part of a projects setup.
The difference between the two is that ESLint is usually responsible for finding and reporting on different patterns inside of ECMAScript/JavaScript code. ESLint is designed to work with JavaScript files only and it is very successful when it comes to ensuring that a codebase is consistent and without notable bugs.
Prettier on the other hand is an opinionated code formatter. Unlike ESLint it supports a variety of languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GraphQL, Markdown and many others. Both tools are fairly well supported in the developer communi…</span>

                              <span>Hello Dev folks, I&#x27;m Gaurav - a front-end focused software developer from India. Recently I came across a JavaScript problem that required me to find sum of all the numbers present in elements of a nested array.
sum([1, &#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;2x&#x27;, [&#x27;3&#x27;, [&#x27;x2&#x27;, &#x27;5&#x27;]]]);
So, you see a nested array with 2 levels of nesting being feed to a sum function.
Immediately it comes to mind that if the array was flattened, the task would have been much easier. So, that&#x27;s what we are gonna do now. Flatten the array. You can flatten any way you want it - 
Use flat method available on arrays.
Use reduce and concat.
Use a library such as lodash.
Use a recursive function 
While using flat method on arrays is simplest to implement, I decided go with 4 and write a recursive method to flatten the array. It is fast and works fo…</span>

In this story I will explain briefly what the host header is, how vulnerabilities can arise, then give several examples. Finally, we will see how to protect against them.
A Host header is a standard HTTP header field that is used to specify the domain name of the website that a user is trying to access. The Host header is used by the web server to determine which website to show the user. 
For example, when a user types in www.example.com, the web server will look at the Host header to figure out which website to show the user. If the Host header is set to www.example.com, the web server will show the user the website that is associated with that domain name.

But well, basically the series is me trying to convince you to not give up when you feel like to 💪🏽. Because well...I&#x27;ve felt that and sometimes I still do but is good to have a reminder that we can feel certain way but we can overcome it.
I was fresh out of my bootcamp, applying to anything that I could remotely fit, and let me tell you, playing the interviews game is hard😫, maybe one day I can write about that but I was mentally exhausted, I was already being ghosted 👻 from a couple companies, moving forward in really long processes and getting rejected from some others.

Hello! Just thought I&#x27;d show how to make a very simple todo app with Rails. 😃
To start using Rails you will need to following installed:
Ruby
SQLite3
Installation will vary depending on the OS you&#x27;re using so I recommend looking at the following guides:
Ruby: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
Then to install Rails you just need to run the following command:
gem install rails

First we need to create the rails application, which can be done with the following command: (I&#x27;ve added some options because we don&#x27;t need everything)
rails new todo --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox --skip-action-text --skip-active-storage --skip-action-cable

If all goes well you should see a &quot;todo&quot; directory in the current workspa…</span>

                              <span>While looking for inspiration for logos to recreate, I browsed Dribbble (the designer social network). Then it hit me, why not create the Dribbble logo.
The one we will be recreating is this one:

We can see the logo represents a basketball, a reference to the product&#x27;s name.
At first glance, we see it&#x27;s a round shape, with three lines over it.
So to recreate this in CSS, we need to start with a round outline and use some child elements to place the three extra lines.
Our outer shape will then receive an overflow none to hide the excess rounds.
Let&#x27;s start by setting up our HTML. I want to keep this as clean as possible, so I&#x27;ll only use one div and one extra element.

                              <span>Startups are usually about the creation of an idea, product, or service that can solve a need, or render solutions to humanity&#x27;s deficiencies. Essentially, the startup must sell a primary idea into the minds of a consumer base.
Ideally, a customer base is built on loyalty and the perception that a certain company can offer the personalized services as they deem fit. Consumer loyalty hinges on these factors. A startup can improve their growth metrics by finding their consumers. Targeting the right customers can help you to remain in business for long.
Discovering and maintaining this customer base is only possible through deploying developer-focused CRM. Studies show that developer-centric CRM solutions enable better access to customer data, allowing for more personalized service.

                              <span>Hi all! Today I want to try a new format with Mezon Framework news. May be it will be more interesting for you.
It was quite surprising for me but some people use Mezon Router to replace Laravel’s one. Here is the proof
You can also refer to it if you need migration tips.
Another news for my router. New feature was implemented after the issue was submitted.
If you need new featured in the router or in other packages of the Mezon Framework – please feel free to submit them )
But as we are speaking about non-ASCII routes let’s look at the simple example:
$router-&gt;addGetRoute(&#x27;кириллический-урл&#x27;, ...callback...);

No changes in your code required. You can use non-ASCII routes as common routes.
Here I want to make a simple announce – right now I do small plugin manager wich can made web applications more  granular.

Tesla has raised the prices of select Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and Model S vehicles, Electrek reports. The largest price increase affects the Model X Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive version, which saw a $6,000 increase from $114,990 to $120,990, while the Model S Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive configuration increased by $5,000 from $99,990 to $104,990. Tesla’s most affordable car, the Model 3, was spared from the most severe increases.
One version of the Model 3 is seeing an increase, however. The Long Range version of the Model 3 increased in price by $2,500 from $54,490 to $57,990. However the price of the most affordable Model 3 version sold online, the Rear-Wheel Drive model, is staying the same at $46,990. That was the price it rose to...

                              <span>When I was a kid growing up in rural Yorkshire, one of the regular attractions at local fairs was a huge steam-powered organ: a baroque monstrosity of pipes, horns, and whistles that would parp out classical tunes to the delight of onlookers. I don’t know if steam organs are still a thing, but if they’ve been retired then I have the perfect replacement: the Floppotron — a mammoth “PC hardware orchestra” that plays music using only electric motors.
Like a fairground organ, the Floppotron is unwieldy, massive, musically unsubtle, and a complete joy to behold. It’s the work of Polish engineer Paweł Zadrożniak, who’s been building various iterations of the instrument since 2011. The first Floppotron consisted of just a pair of floppy drives p...

First, there was Samsung Wallet. Then it became Samsung Pay. Now, because time is a flat circle, Samsung is bringing the Wallet app back — basically, bringing a lot of existing Samsung services into one app. And this time, there’s crypto!
The new Samsung Wallet is available today, and it will take the place of the current Pay and Pass apps, which currently handle payment cards and passwords, respectively. It also integrates with SmartThings to store certain digital home and car keys.
And, of course, the new Samsung Wallet integrates with the existing Samsung Blockchain Wallet app, so you can easily check the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio. Or maybe don’t. Samsung also plans to add some features it teased at its Unpacked event...

Amazon’s annual shopping event, Amazon Prime Day, will officially kick off at 3AM ET / 12AM PT on Tuesday, July 12th, and run through Wednesday, July 13th, the company announced today. We knew it was going to be July, thanks to a prior earnings call, but now Amazon Prime subscribers know when to set their clocks for.
This year’s Prime Day is a few weeks later than it occurred last year, but it’s maintaining its summer timing, as opposed to during the height of the pandemic in 2020 when Amazon delayed the event until October. And if you’re in the market for toys, tech, home goods, or pretty much anything else, it may be one of the best times to save money outside of the Black Friday / Cyber Monday holiday shopping season. It’s almost a...

SwitchBot, the company that makes tiny robotic fingers to press your switches for you, is branching further into the smart home. The new SwitchBot Lock ($99.99) sticks to your door and turns the thumb turn automatically to lock and unlock it. This is the simplest retrofit smart lock solution I’ve ever seen. SwitchBot says it can be installed in seconds since there’s no need to remove any part of your existing door lock. But it does look a bit odd.
The SwitchBot Lock will be available starting June 20th at Amazon and the SwitchBot store along with two compatible keypads — the SwitchBot KeyPad ($29.99) and the SwitchBot KeyPad Touch with a fingerprint reader ($59.99).

A couple of days ago, The Verge reported on a strange glitch that caused Sonos to ship customers more items than what they ordered — and charge extra on top of that. While most customers received anywhere from two to six extra speakers, we were recently contacted by a customer who has had a much more extreme experience.
As a quick recap, all of this emerged after two users contacted The Verge about this issue earlier this week and pointed us to a Reddit thread with users who had the same (or similar) experiences of ordering one or two speakers and receiving several in return. In an email sent to customers (which you can read in full in our previous report linked above), Sonos attributed the problem to a system update resulting in “some...

Panicking because Father’s Day is just around the corner and you have yet to pick up your dad something special? Fret not because we’ve got your back. We did a bit of digging and found a variety of excellent gadgets Dad will love, all of which you can still order today and receive in time for Father’s Day.

https://www.v2ex.com/t/855590
观察了下周围的同学和朋友。
有些家底的，在省会买了房，父母全款，或帮扶了首付，然后背 30 年房贷。
没家底的，都跑体制内去了。有的考了公务员，有的是公立学校老师，有的去了离家近的三四线地级城市。
我属于没家底那种，这些年一直在外漂泊，年龄也不小了，却一直没有啥奋斗结果，感觉大城市买房依旧遥遥无期。
周围的同学朋友都结婚了，而自己还是单身狗。导致有时候很焦虑。
我毕竟不是人中龙凤，自己也天赋平平。高中读的中专，高三怒了努力考了个双非本科。细细回忆起来，这些年所谓的漂泊，实际上就是大城市的一颗螺丝钉。可能人生中最成功的事情，是高三金榜题名的时候。
我意识到再继续耗下去，我只会被大城市吸干最后一滴血，然后滚回老家。
为什么不早点回去，恰好自己也是师范院校毕业的，为什么不考个教师编。
父母虽然负担不起大城市的房价，但却可以负担起老家县城的首付，另外自己也有一些存款。
我算了笔帐，假设我现在薪资 1.5W ，工作日按月 30 天拉通算，假设是 996 ，每天 10 小时，
我的时薪是：15000/30/10&#x3D;50
如果我是公立学校的老师，教信息技术。国家规定每周课不超过 14 节，以 14 节课算，月薪 3500 ，
那么我的时薪：3500/30/(14/7*40/60)&#x3D;87.5 #括号的意思是：每周 14 节课，除以 7 ，平均每天两节课。两节课 80 分钟，除以 60 换算成小时。
算了下，感觉当教师时薪也不错，业余时间也可以研究自己喜欢的东西，搞一搞副业。
今年 10 月底就有教师资格证考试，现在要拿证书，只有参加国家统一考试。之前在学校的时候，学校自己组织考试，我没去拿，肠子都悔青了。。。</span>

看到 n 年前还在学校时期发的帖子  真是倍感沧桑。以前的自己在大三大四时期要准备读研、找工作、进入社会实习。现在却在大城市 临近被毕业，重新回家。都是那份迷茫，却发生在了不同的人生阶段。抛开念旧的成分，很难说自己不喜欢这个行业，计算机贯穿了大学四年和研究生三年的时间，期间写过代码，拿过奖，当过评委，做过研究 也经历过面试、刷题等等大家都会经历事情，但是现在真的会思考是否继续这份事业（ PS 还没到 30 ）.

前俩天在看 Vue3 的代码的时候看到了eddect.ts中一段奇怪的代码，我寻思着这不是在脱裤子放屁吗？
export function triggerEffects(
  dep: Dep | ReactiveEffect[],
  debuggerEventExtraInfo?: DebuggerEventExtraInfo
) {
  // spread into array for stabilization
  const effects &#x3D; isArray(dep) ? dep : [...dep]
  for (const effect of effects) {
    if (effect.computed) {
      triggerEffect(effect, debuggerEventExtraInfo)
    }
  }
  for (const effect of effects) {
    if (!effect.computed) {
      triggerEffect(effect, debuggerEventExtraInfo)
    }
  }
}

经过搜索发现在这么写是有原因的：  https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/5720
这个 issues 展示的列子显示computed没有在正确的时机计算结果。
后续 Vue 官方修复了这个问题。
但是我还有一个问题： SFC 链接
如果使用 3.2.33(#5720 修复前的版本)执行上述 SFC ，得到的结果是
computed count: 0
before inc plusOne: 1
watch count: 1
watch plusOne: 1
computed count: 1
after inc plusOne: 2

可以看到watch plusOne的值是错误的，当然这个问题已经解决了。
如果使用最新的版本，那么顺序是
computed count: 0
before inc plusOne: 1
computed count: 1
after inc plusOne: 2
watch count: 1
watch plusOne: 2

看起来结果正确了，但是watch的位置却在after inc plusOne之后了？
这是预测的行为吗？ 个人觉得这引入了一个新的问题。。但是由于我的水平有限，无法理清内部原理，所以无法确定这是不是正常的。
这个可能和 Vue 的scheduler有关？</span>

目前社交软件通知已全部关闭，只保留电话和短信。好友关系那些啥的已经转移一部分了。我觉得那些东西是真的严重影响我的精神和我的生活。不开任何玩笑，我认为就是这样。已经做到这种境界的 v 友可以分享下个人经验，我来学习下；毕竟“进去容易出来难”。（看不懂或不理解的不要来喷）

下了写 4K 的动画，大多都是 HEVC YUV444p10le 的编码格式，在显示上播放直接卡成 PPT ，播放器用的 KODI ，电视的 SOC 是 MT5895 的，这芯片应该也算性能不错的了，但还是带不动，应该是不支持 10bit HEVC 硬解。
有啥性能好点的盒子推荐么？

                              <span>wyycpg: 背景：
CentOS 下希捷 4T 的机械硬盘[ST4000NM0035-1V4107]。
死机后强制重启，导致无法挂载分区，用 lsblk 只能看到一个 /dev/sdd 。分区表不见了。
    因为 GPT 分区表坏了，superblock 也无法挂载(也可能是我不会)。但是盘尾备份的 GPT 表可以被 gdisk 读取。
    
操作：
用 ddrescue 复制了一部分数据到镜像盘，结果如下
    current pos:     65536 B,  current status: finished
domain size:     4000 GB,  in    1 area(s)
    rescued:     1581 GB,  in 3041 area(s)  ( 39.54%)
  non-tried:         0 B,  in    0 area(s)  (  0%)
    errsize:     2418 GB,  errors:    3041  ( 60.45%)
non-trimmed:         0 B,  in    0 area(s)  (  0%)
  non-split:     2418 GB,  in 17964 area(s)  ( 60.45%)
 bad-sector:    17768 kB,  in 19773 area(s)  (  0.00%)
因为坏道处速度太慢了，只复制这么多。
在镜像盘上尝试用 e2fsck -y -b 819200 修复。但是没有用，读出来是镜像盘之前的目录，我猜是用的是镜像盘之前的 supreblock ？
    
求问：
1.有没有办法直接在坏盘上采用备份 GPT 表打开？用 gdisk 还原一直说 damaged 。但是我看备份所在区块还是好的。
    
    2.有没有快速恢复文件的方法？类似 diskgenius 一样恢复文件？ ddrescue 太慢了，e2fsck 更慢。不知道要几个月。
    
    3.如果是 windows 的软件也可以推荐。diskgenius 很卡，一直报坏道错误，而且无法读取备份 GPT 表，是我方法不对吗？</span>

这个问题有一阵了, 一直不知道啥原因
检查了配置文件
%PROGRAMDATA%/ssh/sshd_config


里面
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile.ssh/authorized_keys

检查了在.ssh/authorized_keys 里面确实有我添加的公钥
用 debug 模式运行 sshd, output 如下:
debug1: trying public key file C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\administrators_authorized_keys
Failed publickey for xxxxxxx

经检查, 根本就没有 C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys 这么个文件
我的公钥都在 .ssh/authorized_keys 里面.
那么是什么导致 OpenSSH 去 administrators_authorized_keys 里面找公钥呢?
翻到 sshd_config 这个配置文件的最下面, 发现有这么两行:
Match Group administrators
       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys

直接注释掉:
#Match Group administrators
#       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys

重启 sshd 服务
再试试 ssh, 这次没有提示要输 password 而是直接用密钥登录了, 问题解决.
PS:
openssh 默认连进去是 cmd 而不是 powershell
可以把 default shell 改成 powershell 方便之后的操作
powershell 下运行:
New-ItemProperty -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH&quot; -Name DefaultShell -Value &quot;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe&quot; -PropertyType String -Force

重启 sshd 服务, 这下直接连进去就是 powershell 了</span>

Browsing the web probably accounts for much of your day. But it&#x27;s an awfully manual process, isn&#x27;t it? You have to open a browser. Go to a website. Click buttons, move a mouse. It&#x27;s a lot of work. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nicer to interact with the Internet through code?
You can get data from the Internet using Python with the help of the Python module requests:
import requests
&#x3D; &quot;https://opensource.com/article/22/5/document-source-code-doxygen-linux&quot;
&#x3D; requests.get(DATA)
print(PAGE.text)

In this code sample, you first import the module requests. Then you create two variables: one called DATA to hold the URL you want to download. In later versions of this code,…</span>

Habits are a long-term interest of mine. Several years ago, I gave a presentation on habits, both good and bad, and how to expand on good habits and change bad ones. Just recently, I read the habits-focused book Smart Thinking by Art Markman. You might ask what this has to do with open organization principles. There is a connection, and I&#x27;ll explain it in this two-part article on managing habits.
In this first article, I talk about habits, how they work, and—most important—how you can start to change them. In the second article, I review Markman&#x27;s thoughts as presented in his book.
The intersection of principles and habits

                              <span>在 Linux 中运行一个 Python 程序只需要简单地在终端中执行 Python 文件就行。

但这对人们来说不是很方便，也不能帮助你调试你的程序。太原始了。

有几个 IDE 和文本编辑器可以用于 Python 开发。Linux 用户可以使用 PyCharm 社区版。

我最近发现了另一个专门为 Python 初学者制作的 IDE。我喜欢这个应用的想法，因此我在这里与你分享。

Thonny 是一个跨平台、开源的 Python IDE，适合初学者使用

Thonny 在用户界面和用户体验方面，感觉就像 Python 版本的 Eclipse。考虑到大多数 C++ 和 Java 的初学者都是从 Eclipse 开始的，而且许多人后来一直使用它，这也不完全是一件坏事。

它不是一个新的工具。它已经出现好几年了。我没有用 Python 进行编码，所以直到最近才发现它。

Thonny 专注于 Python，提供了帮助 Python 初学者了解其程序行为的功能。让我们来看看这些功能。

即装即用

Thonny 自带 Python，所以你不需要为安装 Python 做额外的努力。这对 Linux 用户来说不是什么大事，因为大多数发行版都默认安装了 Python。

界面很简单。它给你一个编辑器，你可以写你的 Python 程序，然后点击运行按钮或使用 F5 键来运行程序。输出显示在底部。



查看变量

在 “查看View-&gt;变量Variables”，你可以看到所有变量的值。不需要将它们全部打印出来。



内置调试器

通过使用调试器一步步运行你的程序。你可以从顶部的菜单或使用 Ctrl + F5 键访问它。在这里你甚至不需要设置断点。你可以用 F6 进入大步骤，或用 F7 进入小步骤。



在小步骤中，你可以看到 Python 是如何看待你的表达式的。这对新的程序员理解他们的程序为什么以某种方式表现非常有帮助。



不止这样。对于函数调用，它会打开一个新的窗口，里面有独立的局部变量表和代码指针。超级酷!

语法错误高亮

初学者经常会犯一些简单的语法错误，如缺少小括号、引号等。Thonny 会在编辑器中立即指出来。

本地变量也可以从视觉上与全局变量区分开来。

自动补全

你不需要输入所有的东西。Thonny 支持自动补全代码，这有助于加快编码。



访问系统 shell

在工具中，你可以访问系统 shell。在这里你可以安装新的 Python 包或学习从命令行处理 Python。



请注意，如果你使用 Flatpak 或 Snap，Thonny 可能无法访问系统 shell。

从 GUI 管理 Pip

进入工具和管理包。它会打开一个窗口，你可以从这个 GUI 中安装 Pip 软件包。



对于学习 Python 来说，功能足够好，对吗？让我们看看如何安装它。

在 Linux 上安装 Thonny

Thonny 是一个跨平台的应用。它可用于 Windows、macOS 和 Linux。

它是一个流行的应用，你可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的仓库中找到它。只要在你的系统的软件中心寻找它。

另外，你也可以随时使用你的 Linux 发行版的包管理器。

在 Debian 和基于 Ubuntu 的发行版上，你可以使用 apt 命令来安装它。

sudo apt install thonny


它会下载一堆依赖关系和大约 300MB 的软件包。

安装后，你可以在菜单中搜索它，并从那里安装它。

总结

Thonny 对于初级 Python 程序员来说是个不错的工具。不是说专家不能使用它，但它更适合在学校和学院使用。学生们会发现它有助于学习 Python 和理解他们的代码是如何以某种方式表现出来的。事实上，它最初是在爱沙尼亚的塔尔图大学开发的。

总的来说，对于 Python 学习者来说是一个很好的软件。

                              <span>本教程介绍了在 Ubuntu 及其他 Linux 发行版上安装 FFmpeg 的步骤。


FFmpeg 是一套处理多媒体文件的软件库。凭借这些强大的库，FFmpeg 能够转换格式、推流以及处理音频和视频文件。许多 Linux 的前端应用都使用 FFmpeg 作为后端支持，所以这些应用对 FFmpeg 的依赖度非常高。举个例子，录屏软件可能会用到 FFmpeg 将录屏转换为 gif 动图。

VLC 多媒体播放器、YouTube、Blender、Kodi、Shotcut 和 Handbrake 等流行的应用与服务都在使用 FFmpeg，这仅仅一小部分。

趣事：NASA 火星 2020 计划的探测器“毅力”号在将图像和视频发送到地球之前，会先使用 FFmpeg 对其进行处理。

关于 FFmpeg

FFmpeg 本身是一款非常强大的命令行实用程序，在 Linux 发行版、Windows 以及 macOS 等系统上均可运行，支持多种架构。FFmpeg 是用 C 语言和汇编语言编写的，性能强大，提供跨平台支持。

核心

FFmpeg 的核心是命令行实用程序，既可在命令行上使用，也可以经由任何程序语言调用。比如，你可以在 Shell 程序或 python 脚本中使用 FFmpeg。


ffmpeg：用于转换音视频格式，包括来自视频直播的信号源。

ffplay：FFmpeg 配套使用的媒体播放器

ffprobe：显示媒体文件信息的命令行工具，可将信息输出为 csv、xml、json 等格式。


FFmpeg 安装

在 Ubuntu 等 Linux 发行版上， FFmpeg 的安装比较简单。打开终端，运行以下命令安装即可。

Ubuntu 及与其相似的发行版

sudo apt install FFmpeg


Fedora

                              <span>开源电子邮件客户端 Thunderbird 将通过 K-9 Mail Android 电子邮件应用项目登陆 Android，该项目与 Thunderbird 合并后的产品就是 Thunderbird Android 电子邮件应用。两年前，Thunderbird 被转移到了 Mozilla 基金会的子公司 MZLA Technologies Corporation 下，该公司的所有权结构与基金会子公司 Mozilla 公司旗下的 Firefox 类似。有了 OpenPGP 端到端加密和期待已久的移动应用等新功能，Thunderbird 项目能够开辟出一条自己的道路。

根据 Thunderbird 团队的说法，Thunderbird 产品经理 Ryan Lee Sipes 和 K-9 的主要维护者 Christian Ketterer，两人早在 2018 年就开始讨论可能的 Thunderbird 电子邮件应用合作了。到了 2022 年，两人决定不再让 Thunderbird 从头开始​​开发自己的应用程序，而是直接让 K-9 加入 Thunderbird。

Thunderbird 团队表示：“许多 Thunderbird 用户都要求在移动设备上获得 Thunderbird 体验，我们打算通过把 K-9 打造成令人惊叹的产品（并将其变成 Android 上的 Thunderbird）来提供这种体验。K-9 将补充提供 Thunderbird 体验，并增强它的使用场景和方式，让用户获得出色的电子邮件体验。我们对桌面 Thunderbird 的承诺没有改变，我们团队中的大多数人都致力于将其打造为一流的电子邮件客户端，并将保持这种状态。”

虽然 K-9 在 Google Play 上并不是特别受欢迎的电子邮件应用，但它已经获得了 500 万次下载。K-9 Mail 的路线图目前包括：使用 Thunderbird 帐户自动配置的帐户设置、改进的文件夹管理、消息过滤器支持，以及桌面和移动 Thunderbird 之间的同步。虽然 Thunderbird 知道人们对 iOS 版 Thunderbird 应用程序也很感兴趣，但在常见问题解答（FAQ）中，该项目仅声明它正在“评估”这种可能性。

Thunderbird 团队还打算将 Firefox Sync 作为一种在 Thunderbird 和 K-9 Mail 之间同步帐户的方法。它应该会在 2023 年夏天正式投入使用。该项目还在研究将哪些 Thunderbird 功能引入 Android 应用程序，例如日历、任务、提要和聊天支持等。

Elon Musk’s Boring Company has received unanimous approval to expand its system of tunnels beneath downtown Las Vegas. The expansion will add stops at landmarks like the Stratosphere and Fremont Street, letting customers hop aboard a Tesla and travel from one part of the city to the next. 
The network of tunnels, called the Vegas Loop, is supposed to span 29 miles and have 51 stops when finished. But for now, only 1.7-mile tunnels are operational beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), turning what would be a 25-minute walk across the convention center into a two-minute ride. The system uses human-controlled Model X and Y vehicles to transport passengers, despite Musk’s previous statements about using sleds to carry cars through...

YouTube is introducing new seasonal recaps of your top artists, songs, albums, and playlists to YouTube Music, starting first with the Spring Recap. YouTube rolled out a Spotify Wrapped-style annual recap at the end of last year, but now YouTube owner Google is taking the concept further with seasonal rundowns. 
“Similar to the 2021 Recap, you’ll find your personalized content in the Spring Recap landing page on the YouTube Music app along with your personalized Spring Recap playlist,” YouTube product manager Ayshaw Khan wrote in a blog post. “Want to tell your friends about your favorite songs of the Spring? Easily share your Spring Recap playlist and stats by simply tapping the arrow at the bottom of your stats card.”

Europe’s second-highest court, the General Court, has sided with Qualcomm after it appealed a €997 million (around $1,045 million) fine from European Union regulators over payments made to Apple to use Qualcomm chips, Reuters reports. The EU issued the fine in 2018, and said payments Qualcomm had made to Apple between 2011 and 2016 to exclusively use its chips were illegal under EU antitrust rules. 
“This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,” said EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a statement accompanying the fine. Qualcomm was accused of shutting rival chipmaker Intel out of the market, by making it too expensive for Apple to switch suppliers.

Tech billionaire Bill Gates has dismissed NFTs as “100 percent based on greater fool theory” — the financial concept that even overpriced assets can make money as long as you find a bigger idiot to sell them to. 
Speaking at an event on climate change hosted by TechCrunch, Gates said he preferred investing in assets with tangible outputs, like farms or factories, “or a company where they make products,” and that he held no position in cryptocurrencies or NFTs. “I’m not involved in that. I’m not long or short in any of those things,” said Gates, suggesting that he was also suspicious of assets designed to “avoid taxation or any sort of government rules.”
“Obviously, expensive digital images of monkeys are going to improve the world...

Keychron’s latest wired mechanical keyboard is the Q5. It uses a similar construction to the excellent Q1 and Q2 keyboards that have proceeded it, but with a larger layout that includes a numpad. It’s not a traditional full-size keyboard, but the idea with its 1800 layout (aka a 96-percent layout) is that it offers almost all of the keys a user might need while still being relatively compact. 
“There’s currently no stock full-metal custom 1800 layout mechanical keyboard on the market,” said Keychron COO Paul Tan. “1800 layout saves about an inch of space from a full-size keyboard, without having to remove many keys. It’s the smallest you can go, without getting rid of the number pad.” The Keychron Q5 is available as a fully-assembled...

Everyone makes mistakes, but if you mess up a fact or flub a line in a YouTube video it can be hard to correct the error. You can edit and re-upload the video, but that means losing all your comments and engagement metrics. You can add a note to the video’s description or pin a comment with the correction, but that might go unnoticed by most viewers.
That’s why YouTube is introducing a new feature named “corrections” that lets creators easily add more obvious corrections. After a video has been uploaded, creators can add corrections that will appear as infocards in the top right-hand corner of a video at the relevant timestamp (but only, it seems, for the first correction in any given video). Viewers can then click on the card to expand...

                              <span>Stone isn’t naturally malleable, and yet, Japanese artist Hirotoshi Ito (previously) carves his sculptures to make the material appear as if it can be unzipped or sliced with a butter knife. Using rocks he finds on beaches near his home in Matsumoto City, Ito chisels tiny caverns that he lines with clasps or simple fasteners. He then tucks miniature objects like teeth, a collection of seashells, and futuristic scenes into those pockets, creating surreal and intriguingly deceptive scenarios in the span of a few inches.

                              <span>A new print from Thomas Scott and Jim Golden satisfies our human urge to organize. The color-coded flat lay arranges dozens of gloves Scott picked up from sidewalks and roadsides while cycling within the first few months of 2022 into a precise gradient. Containing everything from knit mitts and dishwashing essentials to protective workwear, the piece falls into the endlessly fascinating design category of “Things Organized Neatly”—we covered curator Austin Radcliffe’s book on the topic a few years back—and offers some hope that all those gloves we’ve lost throughout the years have found an equally beautiful home.

Plantasia, which consists of smaller works on canvas and large-scale public pieces, magnifies the leaves from dandelions, banana trees, stinging nettle, and other species. Enlarging the specimens to reveal the intricate vein networks and subtle grooves in their midst, the lush murals are bright standouts among largely urban landscapes. More</span>

They filled multiple sketchbooks with playful renderings of animals, fruit, and clowns, and the Spanish artist even created a special book devoted to instructing Maya on how to paint.
These lovingly collaborative works are on view for the first time at The Picasso Museum in Paris after Maya’s daughter, Diana Widmaier-Ruiz-Picasso, discovered the collection of drawings while sorting through storage. More</span>

本次攻击峰值每秒发出 2600 万个请求，是有记录以来最大的 HTTPS DDoS 攻击。进行这次攻击的僵尸网络由来自 121 个国家的 5067 台设备组成，主要来自云服务提供商被劫持的虚拟机和服务器，而不是此前惯用的物联网设备。这次攻击是通过 HTTPS 进行的，目标是 Cloudflare 的一个免费套餐的客户。Cloudflare 表示，其免费和专业 CDN 套餐的所有客户都受到保护以免受类似的攻击而导致停机事故，不仅如此，这种保护是不计费和无限制的，所以无论攻击的规模或持续时间有多大多长，客户都不会被收取更多的服务费。

Adobe 准备推出免费版的 Photoshop

全面拥抱订阅模式的软件开发商 Adobe 准备推出免费版的 Photoshop，以吸引更多用户订阅它的服务。Adobe 正在加拿大测试免费版本，用户可通过免费的 Adobe 账号在 Web 上访问 Photoshop。免费版本提供了足够多的核心功能所需要的工具，Adobe 计划未来将部分工具只提供给付费用户使用。

老王点评：这样看起来倒是不错，比必须花费高昂的买断或订阅费用要合理的多，而且这些免费用户也总有转换成收费用户的机会。




Firefox 默认启用 Cookie 全面保护功能

该功能为你访问的每个网站创建一个单独的 “饼干罐”，嵌入网站的第三方内容在你的浏览器中存入的 Cookie，被限制在只分配给该网站的“饼干罐”内，从而防止追踪公司使用这些 Cookie 来追踪你在各个网站上的浏览情况。之前，该功能没有为所有用户默认打开。该功能使得 Firefox 成为最私密和安全的主要浏览器。Mozilla 表示，Firefox 的 “Cookie 全面保护”功能让“Chrome 和 Edge 望尘莫及”，它希望看到谷歌和微软效仿其做法，为用户提供更好的保护。苹果的 Safari 也有类似的反追踪功能，可以防止跨站追踪并隐藏用户的 IP 地址。

                              <span>我们咨询了我们社区作者们，分享了他们的初学经验。




对 Linux 的新用户有什么建议？我们请社区的作者们分享了他们初学时的最佳经验。

1、用好 Linux 资源

我哥们儿告诉我，Linux 就像一个“软件积木搭建套装”（这是一个过时的词汇，指的是上世纪五六十年代流行的建筑积木玩具），这个比喻比较恰当。在 2001、2002 年那时，我曾经利用 Windows 3.1 和 Windows NT，尝试搭建一个安全、有用的 K12 学区网站，当时网上可用的资料不多。其中被推荐的《ROOT 用户指南》是一本“大部头”专业教程，信息丰富，但是有一定上手难度。

于我而言，Mandrake Linux 的线上课程是最有用的资源。该课程对使用和管理 Linux 桌面或服务器进行了详细的解读。我学习了该课程，并同时利用红帽公司维护的一个邮件列表服务，有问题时就在社区提问寻求帮助。

—— Don Watkins

2、在 Linux 社区寻求帮助

我的建议是要多问，你可以从网上搜索信息开始，看看其他人类似的问题（甚至是更好的提问）。问什么和如何问，需要花一定时间熟悉。

一旦你对 Linux 更加熟悉了，查看你感兴趣的各种相关论坛，在提问前，先看看是否有人已经提过相同问题，并获得了答案。

加入邮件列表也很有用，最后你会发现自己也能专业地答复提问。正如他们说的，通过回答他人的问题也会学到更多知识。

同时，你会越来越熟悉这个操作系统内部运行机制，再也不是初学时的一无所知。

—— Greg Pittman

我的建议是利用 man、info 等帮助命令获取信息。另外，尽可能花时间熟悉命令行界面，且真正理解 UNIX 的设计理念。事实上，我最喜欢的书之一就是一本 80 年代的 UNIX 书籍，对理解文件、目录、设备、基础命令等非常有帮助。

                              <span>不想通过正确输入 验证码CAPTCHA 来证明自己是个人类吗？Cloudflare 可能有了一个解决方案。




互联网服务巨头 Cloudflare  前两天 宣布了 私有访问令牌Private Access Tokens 功能。这项功能旨在减少你在网络上看到的验证码数量，同时改善你的隐私。

你可能已经发现，验证码在移动设备上是一种可怕的体验。通常，它们会最终会占据整个屏幕，有时甚至无法完成。

作为替代方案，网站可以选择收集唯一识别数据，以证明你是人类。当然，从隐私的角度来看，这种做法是很糟糕的。如果这么做，许多重视隐私的公司都几乎无法避免他们受到 僵尸攻击bot attacks。

幸运的是，私有访问令牌（PAT）的发布将改变这一点。

私有访问令牌会产生什么影响？

简而言之，私有访问令牌能够做到下面这些事：


在支持的设备上减少验证码数量

增强用户隐私

允许网站所有者确保访问者来自真实设备


然而，深入观察，我们可以看到私有访问令牌的影响力远不止于此。若使用传统的验证码，就有多个实体可以访问你的数据。

首先，你正在访问的网站知道你的 IP 地址和你正在访问的 URL。当然，这些数据是建立连接所需的最低要求。此外，对于更高级的功能，网站还会发送一些用户代理（UA）数据，还好这些数据并不是唯一可识别的。

然而，另一方，也就是验证码提供者，却可以收集更多的数据。与你要访问的网站一样，它也知道你的 IP 地址、用户代理数据和你访问的 URL。不幸的是，除此之外，他们还会收集其他数据，例如你的设备信息和交互数据。如果把这些信息，与你之前完成验证码的时间联系起来，你就会惊讶的发现，他们可以建立一个非常详细的属于你的个人资料。

幸运的是，有了 Cloudflare 的私有访问令牌，你就可以完全绕过验证码，从而阻止验证码提供者收集此类数据。

私有访问令牌是如何工作的？



验证码的理念是集中尽可能多的数据，私人访问令牌则恰恰相反，它将数据去中心化，因此任何一方都无法唯一识别你。在你提到数据共享之前，Cloudflare 就已经特别指出了，数据不会在各方之间共享。

当你访问使用 Cloudflare 和私人访问令牌的网站的时候，共有三方将处理你的数据的不同部分。


网站。它只会知道你的 IP、URL 和用户代理，这也是建立连接所必需的。

你的设备制造商。他们只会知道那些用于验证设备是否真实所需的设备数据，而不会知道你正在访问哪个网站，或你的 IP 地址是什么。验证了你的设备后，他们将生成一个令牌，该令牌将发送到 Cloudflare。

Cloudflare。他们将收到这个令牌，令牌中不包含你的任何设备数据，只有制造商对它是正品的“保证”。他们知道的唯一其他数据，就是你正在访问的网站，同样，这是为你提供内容所必需的。


通过这种方式，Cloudflare 无需接触你的数据，就可以对“你是一个人”充满信心。

支持的操作系统：没有 Linux？

你可能已经意识到，私人访问令牌需要特定的操作系统功能才能工作。目前，它们仅存在于苹果最新的操作系统上，即 iOS 和 iPadOS 16，以及 macOS Ventura。这是因为苹果的操作系统只在有限的硬件上运行，设备验证会更加容易。

另一方面，Linux 是一种通用操作系统，旨在在各种硬件上运行。因此，我认为，在可预见的未来，它都不会支持私人访问令牌。

回到苹果，我想到私人访问令牌也可能导致消费者维修设备的权利出现一些问题。例如，如果我用第三方的非正品电池更换了老旧的 iPhone 原装电池，私人访问令牌系统会特殊对待这种情况吗？

如果是 Linux 手机呢？这些制造商，如 Pine64 和 Purism，可能没有支持这样一个系统的基础设施。是否可以在这些上使用私人访问令牌呢？

Cloudflare 在 公告 中提到：


我们正在积极努力让其他客户和设备制造商也使用私人访问令牌框架。每当新客户开始使用它时，从该客户进入你网站的流量将自动开始要求令牌，你的访问者将自动看到更少的验证码。


因此，我们希望看到它被更多的设备和操作系统采用。你如何看待 Cloudflare 的私人访问令牌呢？在下面的评论中发表你的看法吧！

Microservices are a hot topic in the software development world right now. Many organizations are looking to adopt this architecture style in order to improve their ability to deliver software quickly and efficiently. One of the key challenges with microservices is designing the overall system in a way that is scalable and maintainable. In this article, we will discuss three popular design patterns that can be used when building microservices: API Gateway, Backend for Frontend, and Event-Driven Architecture.
An API Gateway is a microservice that acts as an entry point for all incoming requests. It is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate backend service, and can also provide addit…</span>

Note:
You can move your cursor onto any of the repository bars/lines on the chart and get the exact number.
The SQL commands above each chart are what we use on our TiDB Cloud to get the analytical results. Try those SQL commands by yourselves on TiDB Cloud with this 10-minute tutorial.







The analytical results displayed above are generated based on just one single metric of these three: stars, PRs, or contributors. Now, we will use the Z-score method to rank the LCDT repos on GitHub.
This is the comprehensive ranking calculated by z-score:

Every experienced developer has at least some design patterns that they have heard about. But the common stereotype is that in front end development no one has ever used them. Today, let&#x27;s dive into the design patterns that are either already being used in Angular development, or, even better, can be utilized to overcome common challenges. 
Singleton is a design pattern in which a certain class can have only one instance. This is useful when you need to have a single instance of a class, but you don&#x27;t want to create a new instance every time you need it, and also useful if we want to share resources or data.
If you are using Angular&#x27;s Dependency Injection, you are already using the singleton pattern, especially if you provide your s…</span>

All the code used in this tutorial can be found on my GitHub project: docker-github-runner-windows or docker-github-runner-linux.
Welcome to Part 3 of my series: Self Hosted GitHub Runner containers on Azure.
In part one and two of this series, we looked at how we can create windows and linux container images using docker and then running our self hosted GitHub runners as containers on a Virtual Machine running docker.
As in the first two parts of this series, instead of preparing a Virtual Machine with docker, we are going to use CI/CD in GitHub using GitHub Actions to build our docker containers and then push the docker images to a registry we will create and host in Azure called Azure Container Registry (ACR).
In part 4 of this blog series we will cover how we can use Azure C…</span>

                              <span>In the last article I was not being quite honest when I said that regex would not work when trying to manipulate Ruby files. Strictly speaking, no, regex is not a good idea for working with tree-like structures and tokens but there is something there we need to take a look at.
Regexp stands for Regular Expressions, or in the way I tend to define it a set of expressions that can describe the shape of text in such a way you can match against anything with a similar shape. We could be pedantic and go into regular languages, but let&#x27;s instead focus on this part:
describe the shape of text
Who&#x27;s to say we couldn&#x27;t have an expression language of some sort that would match against other shapes, like say... ASTs? That, my friends, is where NodePattern comes in and is the start of what we&#x27;ll be cov…</span>

In today&#x27;s article, we&#x27;ll recreate the apple photos logo and make it scalable!
New to CSS design, no problem. You can follow along in this tutorial as we&#x27;ll go through the whole process.
Note: Throughout this article, I will use SCSS because it makes loops and variables easier!
Let&#x27;s first look at how the logo looks and see what we&#x27;ll need from that.

The logo consists of either petal that makes it look like a flow, they are positioned from the center, and each has its color and amount of rotation.
Knowing this, let&#x27;s set up our HTML as we need a container and eight-petal elements inside.

记者今日从河南卫健委了解到，河南卫健委已经就“河南村镇银行入豫健康码变红”事件进行了调查。经疫情防控指挥部和技术服务等部门的调查，初步确定负责豫康码开发运维的公司，在更新外省人员入豫风险判定规则时，由于程序员违规操作，错误使用了过期的规则，导致部分外省入豫人员被错误赋予红码。目前程序 bug 已经修复，被误判的红码也已经变为绿色，相关涉事人员将会被进行下一步追责。
单纯从技术的角度上来看，这个理由似乎不占理啊，
难道程序员顶替临时工，站到了历史舞台中央？</span>

平时经常使用飞书，有下面 2 个需求
飞书中的 PDF 没有办法直接进行高亮等编辑
飞书中的 PDF 不能像插入 airtable 那样插入外部的 PDF 连接，比如坚果云之中的 PDF 。
这 2 个需求大家有什么好的办法整合起来吗？我自己目前的做法是下面这样的
使用坚果云进行同步，通过本地的 pdf 工具进行高亮标注，然后会同步到云端，
再把相关的分享连接插入到飞书之中
但是在流程上不够统一，在飞书里面显示也不够漂亮。</span>

最近写了个小 demo ，实现通过反射将结构体数组，转换成结构实现的接口类型的数组，到这部分没有问题。但是当打算从接口数组转换回结构结构体数组的时候，却转换失败，不知道原因是什么
代码见 https://go.dev/play/p/ajYUDEs6ssQ
如果不是通过反射，是可以通过类型断言将接口类型转换成底层的结构体，因为 go 的接口类型保存有底层结构的类型信息，但是通过反射却无法转换。
本来打算看看 go 反射的底层实现找找原因，但是水平有限没找到……有大手子可以帮忙解解惑吗？</span>

像 openweather 或者 barcodelookup 这种工具, 注册后提供一个 API KEY 来进行接口请求, 而且这些请求都不是免费的, 需要花钱买请求次数. 那么问题来了, app 或者网页端如何保证这些 key 不泄漏?

这是我前几天发的贴子，找到了一个比较方便且完美的方案，前提是要有群晖，如果有更合适的方法也请大家分享。
我是通过 obsidian 上的 remotely save 插件实现 win 与 ios 端的同步的。具体步骤是，群晖上开启 webdav ，按要求在插件里设置一下连接上后，就可以同步了，如果是在本地，可以达到瞬间同步，如果要在外网同步，设置一下端口就行了。在群晖上创建 webdav 同步的文件夹时，勾选上回收站。这样的话，如果在手机客户端上误删了笔记，先在手机同步一下，在群晖回收站内就可以找到被删除的笔记。为了保险起见，还可以把这个文件夹同步到 onedrive ，做到万无一失。</span>

比如，RPC 服务，有时候 IDE 可能无法知道某个函数是一个远程接口的调用点；
再比如，反射出来的的类，IDE 很难通过文本知道，某个变量是什么对象；
再比如，很多项目都有依赖注入、门面、工厂的概念，这些概念可以让你的写的代码更优秀，但是让你改代码时，往往牵一发而动全身；
更甚至，执行字符串 eval(&#x27;print(&quot;hello&quot;)&#x27;) 。
这些无法跳转的函数调用常常会给程序员带来很多烦恼，程序员需要写很多 annotation 去告诉 IDE ，或者在 docblock 中说，嗨，老李，这个函数在某某文件的某行被调用啦，修改前记得看看对那边有没有影响！
所以，人工智能时代的 IDE ，会为程序员解决这个烦恼吗？</span>

比如一个顺序时间索引的价格-成交量表，把每一行的成交量换为该行在最近一百行或者一固定时间段的全部成交量中所属的百分位？
因为把成交量换为百分位后应该可以极大提高数据用于机器学习的泛化能力，比如最后两次成交量为 99 手-49 手，98 手-50 手，可以统一转化为 0.85-0.25

需求概述
近期回国，要在国内呆一段时间。在国内期间虽然有一个常驻地，但一方面很多计算和网络设备在行李里，一方面也会在不同的地区到处跑跑，还有刚回国期间的超长隔离，需要搭建一个 homelab 环境来满足移动时最简单的网络需求和一些软件需求。
网络需求包括：
能够在有有线网络的情况下提供无线网络接入，或者在没有网络接入的情况下，使用 4G modern 提供无线网络接入。
使用一些特定的邮件和搜索服务：虽然各家的 app 越来越封闭，但是搜索引擎还是获取信息特别是外文信息最重要的渠道。
连接学校的 VPN 网络获取文献：这个比较诡异，直联 VPN 可以建立连接，但是实际上因为速度太慢，处于不可用的状态。因此，需要在上级设备中进行网络加速。
提供基本的去广告和防火墙服务。
能够提供基本的冗余和稳定性，也能够提供给家人使用。
在软件上的需求如下：
需要一个 python 环境，可以跑一些简单的自建服务。
需要提供一个 R 环境，可以跑一些简单的定时代码。
以上的两个环境最好都能够有一个 web editor, 这样可以通过 ipad 进行编辑，也可以在笔记本在做其他工作的时候进行一些简单的任务。
能够支持 docker ，快速搭建所需要的服务。
解决方案
All-in-one （放弃）
可能最为方便的解决方案是一个 all-in-one 的小主机。如果采纳这个方案，则首要使用 ESXi 搭建多台 linux 虚拟机，在其中布置多个服务。预计需要虚拟 2-4 台机器：一台 openwrt 。一台 linux 作为 Rstudio server ，一台 linux 作为 code-server 和 python 环境，一台 Linux 跑其他 docker 环境。Rstudio 和 code server 也可以考虑以 docker 容器的方式运行。现在比较合适的机器…</span>

过去已经一个月了
有些东西记不清了
早上 10 点晨会突然晚了些，说总监在开会，然后隔了 20 分钟。总监拉了会议，发了个 wiki 链接，裁员！
两种选择
去另外一个城市
拿补偿
我们一下子都是懵逼的，从去年零零细细的裁员 2000-1000-500-300 人，寻思能到年底裁员呢，毕竟刚发了大版本，还做了小程序版本。
1 个小时之内确定，总监单独找每个人谈了话。他也是临时才知道，后续了解，只有高级总监提前一周知道了。其他组有一些月初裁员了，但技术这边以及北京分部都处于不知道的状态。
下午去了公司，签署了协议。
毕竟是创业的，n+1+去年年终奖（本来是裁员的下个月发的），也会给。年假，调休折钱。没了。
打包好东西回了家。疫情原因，餐饮都关门了，一顿饭没吃就匆匆忙忙分了。
说一下找工作吧。
毕竟没有准备的裁员，因此需要刷题。很迷茫，用了 3 天刷题，然后开始投简历，没消息
逐步的每天 2-3 家面试，难！
大厂卷，都需要笔试，面试过程中还要笔试，有些得 5 次面试，持续一个月。
自己小公司出来的，面了一周拿了几个 offer ，降薪了，具体多少不提了，哎！
然后第二周的面试都拒绝了，累，想计划离开北京，也考虑中年人的生活，未成家立业，只有一个房贷+保险，压力还行。
毕竟怕熟人，入职后的细节就不提了。
难于找工作，有了毕业群，b 站，美团都毕业了好多人，和 hr 也聊了，很多同事没找到工作，申请了失业金。大多数找到的是降薪的，外地的同事也是。而且加班都严重，很多我面试的挺好的没消息的，是被大厂截胡了，或者关闭招聘岗位了，提高了招聘要求。
我容易受社会环境影响，就是社会没有朝气，什么都贵，没啥意思。</span>

用系统 framework 模板创建一个 A 静态 framework 工程，然后用 pod 引入 B 库依赖，接着通过 archive 和 xcodebuild 生成 A.xcframework 。
然后创建一个私有 Pod ，里面只依赖了上面生成的 A.xcframework(使用 vender_frameworks)
然后创建了一个 Demo 工程，通过 Pod 引入了上面的私有 Pod （ xcframework ）和 B 库(源码)，然后编译时就会报错，说找不到 A.xcframework 用到的 B 方法的符号。(pod 库都是静态的)。
但是我看 cocoapods 已经设置好 Demo 工程,例如 framework path 、modulemap path 等.
移除私有 Pod （ xcframework ）只保留 B 库引用，直接跑是没问题的

事情的起因是这样的：
今天收到短信，内容如下：
尊敬的用户：您好，为深入推进防范治理通讯网络诈骗工作，落实工信部断卡 2.0 行动。
您名下尾号为 8866 的号码存在涉诈风险。根据《网络安全法》、《反恐怖主义法》、
《关于依法清理整治涉诈电话卡、物联网卡以及关联互联网账号的通告》等相关法律法规要求，
请您本人于 24 小时内携本人有效证件，通过营业厅或线上方式进行二次实人认证。
逾期未核验或未通过核验的，该号码将被暂停部分功能。
线上二次实人认证请点击 http://wapbj.189.cn/wap2017/index/realperson_auth_check.html  [中国电信] 

咨询 10000 号在线客服之后，得知我号码因为长期不打电话触发了风险控制。让我按短信要求进行二次实名认证。
然后，我先打开指定链接，输入手机号、验证码，然后进入了资料提交页面。
页面显示实名认证的流程大体如下：
提交身份证正面照片
提交身份证反面照片
提交拍摄大头照
这些都好说，我还弄得照片扫描件呢！
但是当我提交的时候。。。。提示无法通过，原因是因为使用了扫描件！！！
然后我把身份证放在背景比较杂乱的地方，然后手机拍摄，提示通过。
心想，用扫描件不是更清晰吗？怎么还不让用呢？
同样的环境，我提交国徽面的时候，又提示认不出来？
？？？
好吧，我又换到一个干净的背景重新提交通过！！！
之后又按要求去提交大头照，验证通过。
以为到这里就结束了。
结果提交完毕，跳转到了第二页：
录制视频，并在四秒内读出 4 位验证码，然后提交视频。

我录制了视频，开始提交，结果提示，不允许使用相册文件。
我想起来我的手机的原生相机应用被我禁用了，然后换用了 Google 相机，
嗯。。。一定是这个原因，他不主动打开我的 Google 相机。
所以我解开了被我禁用的原生相机，重新进入流程，获取验证码、提交身份证、提交大头照，开始实时录制。
录制完毕，相机页面电机完成按钮之后，手机 Chrome 页面完全没反应。。
这个时候我陷入了沉思。还有什么可能造成了这个程序过不去呢？
我突然想起来，用电信的营业厅 app 总算能过吧？
我又打开电信营业厅 app ，搜索实名认证，发现是内嵌 WebView ，不过流程跟刚才一模一样，区别在上传按钮会弹出选择本地相册还是拍照上传。
这不就方便多了吗？早知道如此，我还折腾网页干啥。
结果大头照页面一提交就失败，然后还会自动退出我的账号，返回到登录页面，并需要重新获取验证登录。
来回测试几次，不管是使用本地的照片还是使用直接拍照，大头照那一步验证，就直接给我退出。
这个时候我已经没什么耐心了，因为这个小号只是平常接一些网站注册短信。
现在，我已经打算销户了，然后去手机营业厅搜销户，发现没有这个功能。
然后我试着查询了一下携号转网，看看有什么合约限制没。
短信提示
尊敬的用户您好！您的号码满足携转条件，如需办理携号转网服务，请携带有效身份证件前往
拟携入运营企业当地营业厅办理。受欠费、在网协议等因素影响，携转资格可能发生变化，
建议办理前再次查询。 [中国电信] 

刚收到短信，就接到了 10000 的来电，问情况。
我如实回答：因为接到短信，让我二次验证，结果我折腾了三四十分钟了，一直不成功。
客服查询了我的信息之后说：因为长时间没怎么用过手机，所以进入了静默期，触发了反诈机制。如果这个号还有用的话，就再试试，哪怕携号转网到移动联通，也有这个规定，说是国家统一的。
挂完电话，我想了想，我再试试想想吧。
手机不行，电脑总行吧。
我用电脑打开网页，重新进行流程，嗯。整个过程很顺利。终于上传了录制的验证码视频，提交！搞定！
。。。。
结果又来到了第三步，这个时候我感觉这个流程就像打怪通关一样，无穷无尽。
第三步是反诈活体检测，说是让实时录制视频念一段话。
然后同意开始录制。
这个时候 chrome 提示网站需要使用摄像头和麦克风权限。
授权！录制！
。。。。。
网页又出错了。。。。
怎么都无法进行下一步了。
那就再来一次吧！
把刚才的流程又重新来一遍。
这次在电脑上提交验证码视频的时候，又提示，不允许提交本地视频。。。
但是电脑上又不弹摄像头申请录制的页面。。。。
我又陷入了思考。。。。。到底怎么能让这个鬼东西过去呢？
干脆再换一部手机操作吧！
然后，换手机，打开网页，准备材料，准备提交。
输入手机号，获取验证码。
。。。。。。
对不起，当日发送短信数量过多。无法继续发送。

作为一个从业人员，我连一个实名验证都走不完！！！啊！！！</span>

                              <span>天清气爽，工作顺畅，正是摸鱼好时节，不如就来分享一下我的桌面。没有粉饰，没有滤镜，我的原生桌面就是一个「乱」字，乱乃快乐本源，自在如是。
桌面照片
生产力小部队
桌面硬汉
整个桌面最为辛苦的劳动人民，当属笔记本支架，钢筋铁骨，铁骨铮铮……
总之，如果不是 the tree 的笔记本支架，我又如何可以腰杆笔直、脊柱健康呢？没有优良环境的上班族，都应注意身体姿态，让一个笔记支架抬高自己的健康值无比重要。基本原则，就是使笔记本的高度正好在你的视线稍下方，即水平视线下一拳的位置。
the tree 笔记本支架
桌面消防站
生活苦，需要甜，薄荷糖永远是居家旅行必备之选，LAPEL 薄荷糖是我最近的心头好，我要站在世界中心推荐它，目前在吃的是这款是番石榴口味，味道不腻。而且，这是无糖的薄荷糖，不像那种「无蔗糖」的鸡贼宣传产品，虽然没有蔗糖，但又其他糖，要尝试就尝试敢自称「无糖」的产品，不诚实的东西不会好吃。
LAPEL 无糖薄荷糖
小铁盒的设计也蛮可爱，放在桌面作为一个摆件也未尝不可。我最喜欢薄荷糖的一个点就是——凉爽，刚刚好的凉爽非常适合在文字工作时含上两颗，营造一种不羁的感觉，或许会让创作真得随心所欲一下呢，谁让人类这么容易被暗示呢。
桌面吟咏者
机械键盘大概也算是传统的生产力工具了，尤其对于文字工作者，指尖恰恰的舞伴无疑就是键盘朋友，怎么选择朋友永远是私人的事。于我来讲，公司的机械键盘要声音小，不吵闹，要有个性，不简单，要方便，不麻烦。
洛斐 小浪机械键盘
小浪键盘的一大优点就是轴不错，虽然是茶轴，但是键程短，段落感不是很明显，声音相对较小，让我能够在办公室充当一个温柔的打字人，同时脆脆的声音又不损失打字的确认感。键盘还支持三个蓝牙设备的连接，若是我需要让它为手机、平板和笔记本服务，可以随心切换，但我不需要。值得一提的是，它的切换开关是旋钮，有多大意义呢？这个交互设计不仅增加了使用的乐趣——因为相对不常规，还丝毫不影响效率，简单好玩，妙着呢。
旋钮特写啦
桌面音乐王国
有人肯定会对「薄荷糖是生产力伴侣」有疑问，其实它就和耳机一样，在全神贯注上增加一个方向，摇摆会提高创作的丰富度。我的经验是，为了保证想象力有足够的空间飞舞，必然不能只关注既定的内容，而是通过音乐或者暂停给自己一个分神的机会，让不同的信息进入脑海，还能产生更新鲜的文字。总而言之，耳机很重要。
我的办公桌存在两个耳机，声阔降噪仓和 KZ ES4。它们的分工很简单，降噪仓播放手机的音乐，KZ ES4 播放笔记本的音乐，唯一的切换成本就是摘下耳机与戴上耳机。
降噪声阔舱
为了介绍这位伙伴，我出手就是一个大特写，但狗头不是耳机仓的设计，而是野狗商店的贴纸。无论如何，滑盖打开的仪式感和优秀的降噪能力都是可以吹嘘的资本，而且在声阔 App 中甚至可以为耳朵量声定制声音，鉴于各处都有详细介绍，不缀文了。
KZ ES4
不同于声阔舱的名气，KZ 耳机似乎值得重点着墨一下。这款耳机最明显的设计就是可分离的线材和耳机，通过替换镀银线材能够获得更好的音质，且耳机本身的音质也十分超常，仅仅一百多的身价居然能够拥有这种音质，很值，是我从大学就一直在用的耳机。最近新出的这款半透明绿壳辅以红色内部的设计漂亮极了，戴上耳机，将钩式线材挽到而后，方便帅气更牢固，咱图的就是这稳稳的幸福。
桌面滑手
罗技 G304 实在不用多说，若是你还在苦苦寻觅无线鼠标，没有什么特殊需求就买它，他能将你的小手服侍得服服帖帖。归纳一下，G304 的优势就是：白、轻、快、持久，很难不人见人爱，在茫茫鼠标的选择之中也算的上是本手之选啦。
罗技 G304
快乐联盟军
多功能但没用的加湿器
RinKe 杯面加湿器
毫无疑问，这款加湿器是对日清杯面加湿器的升级，拥有 Type C 充电口以及一颗蛋，整个设计也更整洁，增加了更加立体的视觉效果，但是雾量很小……因此它愧对加湿器的称呼，只适合用来环保上香或者渲染氛围，功能再多，也只是氛围。可我并非需要一个加湿器，只是想找一个玩具，它做得很好，好玩。
长相清爽的小风扇
俗话说得好，天热得吹风，风扇要选好。咱这个风扇摆在桌面就是夏天的意象，风起时更加多彩多姿，小头晃起来就是势不可挡，天气再疯狂，心静自然凉，当然，前提是有小风扇撑腰啦。
仙人掌摇头小风扇
每日俏皮话
俗画说的一历解药，拥有一个摇杆设计，下拉摇杆，就能获得一张卡片日历，然后我将每天的卡片放在相片夹上，便能轻松欣赏日历中的烂笑话。不过，居家一个月后，再来办公室拉摇杆，就太累了——复工当天最大的工作量。

结语
其实桌面上挤了很多东西，不过摸鱼到此为止了。桌面虽然不大，但可以小有乐趣啦。我在很多个公司见过很多个琳琅满目的桌面，即便这些小物件阻挡不了什么甲方乙方，总归还是能柔和下视线所及，眼里是喜欢的东西，心里自然会放下些，有舍有得，有得也有舍，这是快乐的循环。

前言
在很小的时候，我就开始在爸爸妈妈的影响下听他们那个年代的香港流行曲，从一开始的磁带，到后来的 CD 机和 MP3。中学时，我开始听欧美和日韩的流行乐。大学时，我开始听起了德彪西和肖邦等钢琴曲，还有莫扎特的各种管弦乐和协奏曲。
得益于大学学的是德语专业，我有一次意外地观看了一次音乐剧《莫扎特》（Mozart!）。这部音乐剧留下了深刻的印象。这是我第一次完整地听完一部音乐剧作品，我第一次知道竟然还有这样一种艺术表现形式，能够在幽默和严肃，通俗和高雅之间取得这么好的平衡。故事脉络清晰，对话通俗易懂，角色的表现生动鲜活。但是它提出的问题也是沉重深邃的：什么是天才，天才意味着什么，天才应该怎么活着。正是这种介乎于熟悉和陌生，大众和小众之间的微妙平衡感，让我开始慢慢留意音乐剧这种表现形式并为之着迷。
从我开始慢慢接触不同的音乐剧，到现在也有快四五年的时间了。了解得越多，我越发现音乐剧这个世界无边的广阔和魅力。虽然，在这个领域我还远称不上是专家，但是在我的心里面依然有种热情想要让把音乐剧介绍给大家。于是，我想借着这个机会，尝试从一个没有受过严格音乐训练的普通听众的角度来给大家介绍一下音乐剧这种艺术形式，希望能够为大家在闲暇时间消遣时光提供多一个选择。
因为我毕竟不是专家，所以难免有各种疏漏，欢迎各位大佬在评论区指正。
音乐剧是什么
音乐剧是音乐，歌剧，舞蹈，戏剧，杂耍，科技和综艺结合的一种戏剧表演。和歌剧，舞剧，话剧等舞台表现形式有相似，但是音乐剧的独特之处在于其对歌曲、对白、肢体动作、表演等因素给予同样的重视。因此，在欣赏音乐剧…</span>

                              <span>因为最新的 MIUI 测试版 /其它部分 UI 会始终显示 NFC 图标，所以写一下这个图标如何隐藏。
准备工作：

USB 数据线
电脑端 adb
手机打开 USB 调试，部分设备需要打开USB 调试（安全模式） 一般会在 USB 调试开关的下方

操作步骤：
adb shell settings put secure icon_blacklist nfc
nfc 可以替换成下面的内容，多个的话可以用,分割。


图标图标描述

volume静音 /震动图标
location定位图标
speakerphone麦克风使用中图标
wifiwifi
hotspot热点
alarm_clock闹钟
bluetooth蓝牙
airplane飞行模式
headphone耳机
cast录屏状态
nfcnfc


如果需要恢复，需要使用：
adb shell settings put secure icon_blacklist null

注意一：上面这条命令会一次性恢复所有图标
注意二：如果你需要屏蔽多个图标，那么你需要使用英文逗号“,”将图标名称隔离开来，一次性输入。</span>

I have used word processing software for as long as I can remember. When word processors moved from direct formatting to leveraging styles to change how text appears on the page, that was a big boost to my writing.
LibreOffice provides a wide variety of styles that you can use to create all kinds of content. LibreOffice applies paragraph styles to blocks of text, such as body text, lists, and code samples. Character styles are similar, except that these styles apply to inline words or other short text inside a paragraph. Use the View -&gt; Styles menu, or use the F11 keyboard shortcut, to bring up the Styles selector.

Some people think the cloud-native ecosystem has a high barrier to entry. At first glance, that looks like a logical assumption. Some of the technologies used in cloud-native projects are complex and challenging, if you&#x27;re not familiar with them, so you might think you need proven expertise to get involved.
However, looks can be deceiving. This article provides a detailed roadmap to breaking into the cloud-native ecosystem as an open source contributor. I&#x27;ll cover the pillars of cloud-native architecture, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and ways to earn more.

今天我们介绍关于  List 和 Iterable 里有趣的知识点 ，你可能会觉得这有什么好介绍，不就是列表吗？但是其实在 Dart 里 List 和 Iterable 也是很有意思设定，比如有时候我们可以对 List 进行 map 操作，如下代码所示，你觉得运行之后会打印出什么内容？
var list &#x3D; [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;];
var map &#x3D; list.map((e) {
  var result &#x3D; int.parse(e) + 10;
  print(&quot;######### $result&quot;);
  return result;
});

答案是：什么都不会输出，因为通过  List   返回一个 Iterable 的操作（如 map \  where）的都是 Lazy 的，也就是它们只会在每次“迭代”时才会被调用。
比如调用 toList(); 或者  toString(); 等方法，就会触发上面的  map  执行，从而打印出对应的内容，那新问题来了，假如我们把下图四个方法都执行一遍，会输出几次 log  ？em····答案是 3 次。

其中除了 isEmpty 之外，其他的三个操作都会重新触发 map 方法的执行，那究竟是为什么呢？
其实当我们对一个 List 进行 map 等操作时，返回的是一个  Iterable  的 Lazy 对象，而每当我们需要访问里面 value 时，  Iterable   都会重新执行一遍操作，因为它不会对上次操作的结果进行缓存记录。
是不是有点懵？这里借用 fast_immutable_collections  作者的一个例子来介绍可能更会清晰，如下代码所示：
我们对同样的数组都调用了 where 去获取一个  Iterable

T-Mobile is certainly not afraid to tout its own 5G achievements, and true to form, it’s announcing another milestone today: by combining three channels of mid-band spectrum on its 5G network, the company achieved 3Gbps network speeds. This seems to be more than a stunt, too — T-Mobile says this technology will become available to customers on its network “later this year.”
Those 3Gbps (or 3000Mbps) speeds are approaching mmWave territory — that’s the high-band, limited range kind of 5G that lets you download a movie in seconds. Mid-band 5G typically reaches around 200Mbps, and that’s considered very good compared to LTE — but T-Mobile is doing a little tinkering behind the scenes to boost those speeds significantly.

Sony’s upcoming Gran Turismo film is apparently hitting theaters sooner than we might have expected — its scheduled for release on August 11th, 2023, according to a new report from Deadline. Neill Blomkamp is set to direct the movie, which is supposed to be based on a true story.
Seriously. Here’s the official logline (aka short summary) of the movie, per Deadline: “Based on a true story, the film is the ultimate wish fulfillment tale of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills won a series of Nissan competitions to become an actual professional race car driver.” That means the film likely pulls from the story of someone from the GT Academy, which let Gran Turismo pros compete to join a real-life racing team sponsored by Nissan...

Instagram Stories seem to be misbehaving for some users, making it so that they have to re-view all of someone’s stories before they’re able to see new ones. The issue has affected several Verge staff members since yesterday, and some Reddit users have reported the same thing is happening to them. 
Meta spokesperson Christine Pai told The Verge in an email that the company is “aware that some people are having trouble accessing Instagram Stories.” Pai said Instagram is “working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,” and apologizes for the inconvenience.
The root issue seems to be that Instagram doesn’t remember where you left off when viewing someone’s stories. For example, if one of my friends has posted five stories, and...

Peacock is bringing Downton Abbey: A New Era to its streaming service on June 24th. The film, which was released on May 20th, will exclusively stream on the platform following its departure from theaters.
New Era is the sequel to the 2019 Downton Abbey film (which Peacock currently owns the rights to stream as well) and the original series. It centers around the Crawleys and staff as part of the family embarks on a journey to a villa in France, while the others greet a movie crew that arrives at the estate. If you’re a fan of Singing in the Rain, you’ll probably have a good time.
To celebrate the film’s arrival (and to help fans catch up before the film’s arrival), Peacock also added a 24/7 channel that will just air seasons 1 through 6...

Twitch is expanding its ad incentive program to include more creators and pay them more money. Earlier this year, Twitch began offering select streamers a flat, guaranteed payment in exchange for running a fixed amount of ads during a fixed number of hours. Now, Twitch is opening up the program to include more partners and is changing the way it structures payouts to pay creators more.
Originally, payouts earned with the ad incentive program were calculated using a CPM model. Basically, streamers would get a flat rate for every 1,000 ads watched on their channel. 
“We found that a fixed CPM model wasn’t the most straightforward way to share revenue with creators,” said Mike Minton, vice president of monetization at Twitch, in an email to...

Elon Musk will attend a virtual all-hands meeting with Twitter employees this Thursday, during which he’ll field questions from the company he’s in the process of buying. His attendance was announced in an email from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Monday seen by Business Insider. Employees will be able to submit questions in advance of the meeting. It will be the first time Musk has addressed Twitter’s nervous employees directly since announcing plans for the $44 billion takeover.
The meeting has the chance to be fractious. In Twitter’s internal Slack channels, the Tesla CEO’s attempt to buy the company has reportedly been met with a negative response, and employees are concerned about the effect a privately-owned Twitter could have on...

Meta is adding a new “voice mode” to Horizon Worlds that garbles any voice chat coming from non-friends on the VR social platform, the company has announced.

Android Police reports seeing the new toll pricing in the app, though it’s not yet visible on a pair of devices we’ve tried along the same route.

                              <span>如果有人咨询装机建议，个人一向优先推荐MATX方案，也分享过众多MATX箱体的作业。这次618，刚好帮网友装一台MATX箱体作业，这就是来自诞生众多经典小钢炮箱体的银欣，所带来最新MATX箱体的 【ALTA G1M】。

 
01/ 机主的需求
这次的机主已经算熟人了，就是上次专门订制一台白色SSUPD Meshlicious给自己夫人的朋友。本来他的作业是安排在年后，结果因为各种不可抗力因素，拖延到了618期间搞定。不过刚好这个案子包含采购等价格，也都方便大家参考。
机主的需求
这台机子的主要用途可能就是娱乐，整机风格依旧偏好跟之前作业一样，低调有质感，尽量避免光污染，然后箱体要相对紧凑。上次做了SSUPD Meshlicious白，所以这次箱体颜色偏好黑色箱体。期间其实也考虑过众多箱体，最后因为时间周期等原因，就选了主打【性价比】的银欣 ALTA G1M。

 
配置部分
机主一开始给的预算就比较宽裕，加上平台降价，特别是显卡降价，所以整机也从之前的i5升级到了i7级别。
我这边针对i7跟i5 各推荐一套配置，包含13K跟7K左右的配置，方便不同预算的用户抄作业。

桌面效果
只看数据的话ALTA G1M，尺寸数据其实一般，因为有31L，不过实物因为是垂直结构设计，所以占用桌面面积跟常规ITX箱体是相当的，我这边对比是银欣自家的13L迷你箱体SG16，可以看实际占用桌面空间几乎一样。
以前我也没感觉这有什么意义，后面到深圳工作后就发现，桌面占用位置小点，然后垂直往上的话还是可以接受的。

 
ALTA G1M的高度则相当于27英寸显示器支架升高后的高度，然后外观设计语言我个人是挺喜欢的，有个人工作站的感觉，所以海外网站pugetsystems之前也喜欢用他们家的箱体弄一些DIY工作站方案销售。

有一座建造在大山之中，有如纪念碑般大小的机械钟，它旨在未来一万年精确运行，被称为万年钟。
万年钟有几百英尺高，被设计成只需要最少维护成本，它的动力来自太阳热能，以及游客提供的机械能。
我们希望你是游客的一员。
（从上往下看，弯曲的平台）
万年钟用天文原理和日历表盘记录时间，并在音乐家 Brian Eno 的帮助下设计了一个钟声器，它可以计算出超过 350 万个独特的钟声序列，已满足未来一万年的每一天能响起一个钟声。
一万年大约是一个现代文明的年龄，所以这座钟将测量出一个与过去相等的文明的未来（译者注：从 2022 年倒数，一万年前就是公元前 8000 年左右，是为新石器时代，彼时人类仍在洞穴居住，学习驯化牛羊）。所以建造万年钟的假设前提是，我们当下正处于整个人类文明旅程的中间阶段——这是一种乐观主义的含蓄表达。
要想看到万年钟 ，你必须像其他朝圣者一样，在黎明时分出发，并徒步一天，才能到达大钟的内部。
目前，它仍然在德克萨斯州西部的大山深处组装。

为什么要造一个巨钟？
这座巨钟，它就像一封稀有的邀请函，邀请我们在文明的时间尺度上思考和设计，同时它也像一个象征长久的符号，以表达我们个人与遥远未来的联系。
The Clock of the Long Now
为什么会有人在一座山里建造一个钟，并希望它能响彻万年？
这是部分答案：正如人们会问这个问题一样，这个问题本身会促使他们自己脑中浮现出几代人和几千年的概念。如果你有一个滴答万年的钟，那么你将提出何种跨世代问题，创建何种项目？如果一个钟真能运行万年，我们难道不应该确保我们的文明应该如此吗？如果这个钟在我们逝去之后还长久运作，为什么我们不提前去做那些需要后代完成的项目呢？

更大的问题是，正如病毒学家 Jonas Salk 曾问，「我们是好祖…</span>

从商品量、收入规模等数据来看，亚马逊可以说是世界第一大购物平台。网络服务检测网站 Downdetector 的追踪数据证实，美东时间 6 月 13 日下午 1 点到 3 点，亚马逊主站出现了宕机，长达 2 小时。讽刺的是，根据统计显示，亚马逊多年都是全球第一大云服务供应商，已经建立了自研芯片、服务器、计算、存储、网络等软硬一体的新型计算体系架构。

老王点评：连亚马逊这样的毫无疑问的云计算第一大厂，都保不了自己的电商网站，那么我们追求的云计算它到底可靠吗？




K-9 邮件加入 Thunderbird 邮件旗下

Thunderbird 是最好的开源邮件桌面客户端，但一直没有对应的移动客户端。如果要开发一个功能完备的移动客户端可能花费很长时间。因此，Mozilla 选择将 K-9 邮件移动客户端及其维护者收入旗下。以《神秘博士》中的机器狗命名的 K-9 也是一个开源项目，它可能是安卓上功能最丰富的电子邮件应用。目前该客户端计划中的功能包括：账号设置使用 Thunderbird 账号自动配置、支持信息过滤器，在桌面和移动版本的 Thunderbird 之间进行同步等等。不过，Thunderbird 的日历、任务、馈送等非电子邮件功能不会出现在移动应用中。


消息来源：Thunderbird



老王点评：这看起来是一件好事，强强联手。不过，希望 K-9 和 Thunderbird 的融合对两者都有利，而不是互相冲突。




PyPI 多个软件包因拼写错误包含后门

PyPI 软件包 keep 的绝大部分版本都包含合法的 Python 模块 requests，该模块用于 HTTP 请求，但 keep v.1.2 包含的模块 request（没有 s）是一个恶意程序，能从 Chrome 和 Firefox 等浏览器中窃取 cookie 和个人信息，并尝试窃取浏览器保存的登录凭证。除此以外，还有一些其它的 PyPI 软件包也存在这种安全缺陷。


消息来源：BleepingComputer



老王点评：难道这些软件包的开发人员就不做测试吗？你想想，你精心搭建的软件就是建立在一些别人随手写出来的模块之上。</span>

                              <span>这篇教程将介绍如何在 Ubuntu 22.04、20.04 和 18.04 LTS 版本中引导到 救援Rescue 模式或 紧急Emergency 模式。


你可能已经知道，在 RHEL 7 、RHEL 8 、Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 及其更新的版本的 Linux 发行版中 运行等级Runlevels 已经被 系统目标Systemd target 所替代。更多关于 运行等级Runlevel 和 系统目标Systemd targets 的信息，参考 这篇指南 。


这篇指南是针对 Ubuntu 编写的，但是，下面所给的步骤应该也适用于大多数使用 systemd 作为默认服务管理器的 Linux 发行版。

在进入主题前，让我们简单的理解：什么是 救援rescue 模式 和 紧急Emergency 模式，以及这两种模式的目的是什么。

什么是救援模式？

在 Linux 发行版中，救援模式等效于使用 SysV 作为默认的服务器管理器的 单用户single user 模式。在救援模式中，将挂载所有的本地文件系统，将仅启动一些重要的服务。但是，不会启动一般的服务（例如，网络服务）。

救援模式在不能正常引导系统的情况下是很有用的。此外，我们可以在救援模式下执行一些重要的救援操作，例如，重新设置 root 密码 。

什么是紧急模式？

与救援模式相比，在紧急模式中，不会启动任何的东西。不会启动服务、不会挂载挂载点、不会建立套接字、什么都不会启动。你将所拥有的只是一个 原始的 shell 。紧急模式适用于调试目的。

首先，我们将看到如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 和 20.04 LTS 发行版中引导到救援模式或紧急模式。在 Ubuntu 22.04 和 20.04 LTS 中的过程是完全相同的！

                              <span>这个快速指南解释了恢复 Arch Linux 安装的一些方便步骤。


作为一个滚动发布的版本，Arch Linux 中有时会出现一些问题。不是因为你自己的行为，而是数以百计的其他原因，如新内核与你的硬件或软件的兼容性。但是，Arch Linux 仍然很棒，它提供了最新的软件包和应用。

但有时，它也会给你带来麻烦，你最终只能看到一个闪烁的光标，其他什么都没有。

所以，在这种情况下，与其重新格式化或重新安装，不如在放弃希望之前尝试恢复安装和数据。本指南概述了这个方向的一些步骤。

恢复 Arch Linux 安装

第一步是用 Arch Linux 创建一个可启动的现场Live USB。从 这个链接 下载 .ISO 并创建一个可启动的 USB。你可以查看这个 如何使用 Etcher 创建可启动的 USB 的指南。记住这一步需要另一个稳定的工作系统，因为你目前的系统不能使用。

你需要知道你的 Arch Linux 安装在哪个分区上。这是一个非常重要的步骤。如果你不知道，你可以用 GParted 来查找。或者在你的 GRUB 菜单中查看，或者你可以运行下面的命令来了解。这将列出你所有的磁盘分区及其大小、标签：

sudo lsblk -o name,mountpoint,label,size,uuid


完成后，插入 USB 盘并从它启动。你应该在现场介质中看到 Arch Linux 的提示符。

现在，用下面的方法挂载 Arch Linux 分区。记得把 /dev/sda3 改成你对应的分区。

mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
arch-chroot /mnt


arch-chroot 命令将在终端挂载你的 Arch Linux 分区，所以用你的 Arch 凭证登录。现在，在这个阶段，根据你的需要，你有以下选择。


你可以通过 /home 文件夹来备份你的数据。如果，故障排除方式无效的话。你可以把文件复制到外部 USB 或其他分区。

核查日志文件，特别是 pacman 日志。因为，不稳定的系统可能是由升级某些软件包引起的，如图形驱动或任何其他驱动。根据日志，如果你需要的话，可以降级任何特定的软件包。


你可以使用下面的命令来查看 pacman 日志文件的最后 200 行，以找出任何失败的项目或依赖性删除。

tail -n 200 /var/log/pacman.log | less


上面的命令给出了你的 pacman.log 文件末尾的 200 行来验证。现在，仔细检查哪些软件包在你成功启动后被更新了。

并记下软件包的名称和版本。你可以尝试逐一降级软件包，或者如果你认为某个特定的软件包产生了问题。使用 pacman -U 开关来降级。

pacman -U 



如果有的话，你可以在降级后运行以下命令来启动你的 Arch 系统。

exec /sbin/init


检查你的显示管理器的状态，是否有任何错误。有时，显示管理器会产生一个问题，无法与 X 服务器通信。例如，如果你正在使用 Lightdm，那么你可以通过以下方式检查它的状态。

systemctl status lightdm


或者，可以通过下面的命令启动它，并检查出现了错误。

lightdm --test-mode --debug


下面是一个 Lightdm 失败的例子，它导致了一个不稳定的 Arch 系统。



或者通过使用 startx 启动 X 服务器来检查。

startx


根据我的经验，如果你在上述命令中看到错误，尝试安装另一个显示管理器并启用它，如 sddm。它可能会消除这个错误。

根据你的系统状态，尝试上述步骤，并进行故障排除。对于特定于显示管理器 lightdm 的错误，我们有一个 指南，你可以看看。

如果你使用的是 sddm，那么请查看 这些故障排除步骤。

总结

每个安装环境都是不同的。上述步骤可能对你不起作用。但它值得一试，根据经验，它是有效的。如果它起作用，那么，对你来说是好事。无论哪种方式，请在下面的评论区中告诉我结果如何。

                              <span>OpenInfra 基金会的前身为 OpenStack 基金会，几年前它将范围扩展到其旗舰项目之外，于是改了名字。2022 年 6 月 7 日，它宣布了一种有趣的新方式，让企业资助基金会内的开源项目。一般来说，开源基金会的企业成员通过支付会员费来支持该组织，然后基金会按照他们认为合适的方式分发这些费用。OpenInfra 基金会现在推出了一种新的“定向资助”模式，允许成员将他们的资金直接用于项目。

此前，基金会并不允许这样做，因为正如 Bryce 指出的那样，它可能会产生混合激励和付费游戏动态，而该组织一直试图避免这种情况。然而，社区对支持特定项目有很大的兴趣，这是有道理的，因为该基金会现在拥有更多种类的项目，但并不是每个成员都对每个项目进行了大量投入。

Bryce 表示，基金会的领导层和董事会，花费了大量时间来考虑，如何使基金会的核心原则与这种新模式相协调。因此，该模型试图将过去十年运行良好的 OpenStack/OpenInfra 技术治理模型的优点，与这些新的财务考虑相结合。

在这种“定向资助”模式下，每个新项目都将拥有自己的法人实体来持有项目资金。为确保新项目的合法性，OpenInfra 白金会员（目前为 9 家，包括蚂蚁集团、华为、Meta、微软和红帽）必须担任项目的发起人，之后其他组织才能加入项目基金。如果赞助公司还不是 OpenInfra 成员，则必须成为成员。然后，所有这些资助成员组成一个项目基金管理委员会，决定创建预算的费用。与此同时，OpenInfra 基金会将为这些项目提供社区建设服务。

这种新模式暂时只适用于加入基金会的新项目。Bryce 和 Collier 指出，组织可能会在一些现有项目中追溯应用这种新模式，但这个考虑目前不在路线图上。

自从将范围扩展到 OpenStack 之外后，OpenInfra 基金会增加了一些新项目，例如用于提高容器安全性的 Kata Containers、用于基础设施生命周期管理的 Airship、Startling X 边缘计算堆栈以及 Zuul CI/CD 平台。

“我们从每个成功的项目中学到的最重要的一点是，协作是关键，支持生态系统的范围越广越好，” OpenInfra 基金会总经理 Thierry Carrez 说，“事实上，我们发现最成功的开源项目是由多家公司资助的，因为他们能够整合资源以实现更高的回报率。”

这种新模式显然是 OpenInfra 基金会引入新项目和新成员的一种方式。正如领导团队欣然承认的那样，其在多方生态系统中管理开源项目的模型 —— 无论是通过新的定向资金还是更传统的方法 —— 可能并不适合每个项目。即使 OpenInfra 基金会只收到一小部分项目，随着对这些复杂云基础设施项目需求的增长，开源项目的数量也在增加，同时它们也变得更加复杂。

基金会还宣布了其各个项目的几个里程碑版本的发布，包括 Kata Containers 2.0 版、Zuul 5.0 版和 StarlingX 6.0 。

Collier 说：“基金会今年庆祝成立 10 周年，在展望下一个十年的开放基础设施之际，我们正在推动我们的模型如此成功的关键，那就是：将希望合作的公司和个人联合起来，为他们提供一个框架和有效协作的工具，并帮助他们投资资金以最好地帮助他们关心的项目。”

Creating content for software developers is tricky and time consuming. In this article, I’m going to explain what you can do to make the most of your content and capture a larger audience.
I’ll introduce you to:
Promoting Before Publishing
Rewriting Content
Publishing to Third-party Platforms
Repurposing Content
Follow-on Content
Syndication
Promotion
Once you’ve published a piece of content, your work is only half-finished. For that content to have an impact on your developer community and attract a larger audience, you need to promote and reuse it far and wide.
I’ve created an example workflow as a guide for how you can do this with a blog post:

                              <span>Why build an application using blockchain?


The first question someone could have when considering building applications using blockchain is why doing it. It is a very important question that we believe should be asked no matter the technology or the solution that you are trying to create, since usually our objective is to solve a problem, not to use a specific technology.
Nowadays, the Web3 ecosystem is very focused on very specific use cases, but that doesn’t mean that those specific use cases are the only ones that blockchain can provide value to. I believe that the value that blockchain can provide is beyond digital assets and decentralized finance. I believe that trust is the most important value that blockchain can provide.

                              <span>Data Consistency is an enigma of Distributed Architecture. It is a rather poetic way to say that something is a pain in the ass.
It might not be that obvious at the first glance, but Data Consistency never exists in isolation. It is heavily bonded with Availability and Partition Tolerance. If they sound alien, don&#x27;t worry. We will closely look at them and their friendship in a moment
An interdependency between Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance in the distributed system has been described by the CAP Theorem. Originally it was formulated by Eric A. Brewer for distributed data stores. But it is applicable for any distributed stateful architecture, hence Microservice Architecture.
I think its applicability is worth explaining.

Wasp is a simple declarative language that makes developing web apps easy while still allowing you to use the latest technologies like React, Node.js, and Prisma.

You know how to use React, know your way around HTML/CSS/…, know how to write business logic on the backend (e.g. in Node), but when you want to build an actual web app and deploy it for others to use, you drown in all the details and extra work — responsive UI, proper error handling, security, building, deployment, authentication, managing server state on the client, man…</span>

In this post, we are going to expand our existing project on Github to be able to build an “apk” file for Android and a zip file for iOS. Before I can show you how this is possible, let’s start with some challenges that I’ve faced 🙂
The aim of this CI/CD pipeline is (not yet) to be able to push the apps into the AppStore / PlayStore for testing. That’s something we can add later 😉
While preparing this post I unfortunately faced more problems building up the pipeline than expected. Several problems.

In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll take a look at the different ways you can deploy a new Astro site on Netlify, and the choices you need to make along the way. But first, a little overview of Astro.
Astro is currently in beta (version 1.0.0 at the time of writing), and was launched to the web development community in early 2021. In an Astro project, you write JavaScript, HTML and CSS in .astro files, and the extra special thing about Astro is that you can also build projects using your favorite JavaScrip…</span>

                              <span>Developer productivity receives disproportionate attention considering the share of organizations where it happens to be a bottleneck.
With tech being at the center of value creation engine for an increasing number of businesses, it&#x27;s natural to look into every opportunity to be more efficient. There is however a misleading assumption that developer productivity is a universal leverage to an organization&#x27;s performance.
A single team has little collaboration overhead and, constrained by its limited capacity, tends to have few goals and strong focus. Delivery performance in that context can therefore be directly attributed to developer productivity.
This ideal however tends to break down as early as having two or three teams. As an organization scales, the influence of individual developer p…</span>

Conventionally, these markers can be divided into several points:
Teamwork: I don&#x27;t build solo teams, I assemble effective teams that can get the job done. Each member of the team should be able to communicate and at the same time not go into conflict, disagreements happen to everyone, but they need to be resolved peacefully;
The ability to convey your thoughts: working in a team on one project involves a lot of communication and the ability to explain your ideas, ask the right questions is critical;
The ability get things done: any task is of value only when completed,…</span>

因为这个几天 hr 催我过去，说什么上海已经逐步恢复线下办公了。
然后我爸妈的意见是让我先别去。
真是让人头疼。
我有以下这些问题:
上海是否有大规模封城的可能性？
上海的物资或者生存是否有保障？
上海出行或者快递是否正常运行？</span>

19 年买的 macbook 16 寸 i9 顶配，连上 4k 显示器平常打打英雄联盟，装了 win to go 偶尔还能玩玩 3A 大作，写一写老师布置的编程作业。用的一切都巨丝滑，除了发热。
21 年出了 m1 max 的 16 寸，以 1500 刀的价格直接把 19 的 macbook 抵换了新的 m1 max 32g ，对我的体验完全没有任何的升值，反而降低了。
美服英雄联盟因为 Rosetta ，fps 从 300 到维持 100 都困难，装不了 win to go 自然与 3A 大作无缘，不过好在有 ps5 现在也很少玩游戏了。主要用来刷刷题，找工作。m1 max 颜值差，重量沉，带上 ipad 简直负重前行
感觉 macbook air 才是最适合我的，甚至只要一台能打开 leetcode 网页的电脑就行了，毕竟只是偶尔打开 IDEA ，大部分时间都是在网页 Leetcode 上面刷题，m1 max 这玩意儿是给视频工作者的。</span>

(把我之前的微博转过来，图片有点麻烦，先不贴了。原微博链接 https://m.weibo.cn/status/4643295529800447)
我一直使用微软的 outlook 邮箱。今天有朋友发邮件给我，看我没有回复，便在微信上找到我问我为什么不回邮件，我登录 outlook.com 才看到邮件被放到垃圾邮件里。
这已经不是第一次了。
更要命的是，垃圾邮件会在 10 天后被自动删除，没有提醒（图 1 ）。心里一惊，我使用 outlook 邮箱很多年了，不知道有多少封重要邮件被默默删除。
亡羊补牢。我打开设置，寻找垃圾邮件设置，想关掉这个 zz 的垃圾过滤功能，然后惊讶地发现并没有关闭选项。（图 2 ）
于是到网上搜索了一下，发现了无数帖子，最早从五六年前到现在，时不时都有人问：“如何关闭 outlook.com 的垃圾邮件过滤？” 有的发在 stackoverflow/reddit/quora 甚至微软自己的 answers 客服平台。以下给出一些链接：
*微博发不了链接，算了。随便 google 一下 How to turn off outlook junk email filters 到处都是。
然后更令人震惊的是，所有人都在最后失望地被告知：无法关闭。也就是说，这是一个强制功能！微软对自己的垃圾邮件过滤算法如此自信，以至于强制所有人开启！然后这个算法真的很厉害吗？显然不是。许多人贴出自己的经历，说自己的家人邮件全部被放到垃圾邮件然后默默删除，说自己因为面试邮件被删除而错失工作机会。（图 3 ，4 ）几百个赞同和回复，表示遇到同样问题。不胜枚举，让人匪夷所思。
注意这个不是 outlook desktop 软件的垃圾过滤功能。关闭那个没用的。邮件在抵达 outlook desktop 之前就已经被过滤掉了。
有人愤怒的质问微软客服，说这是 simply unacceptable 。有人用加粗大写字母慷慨陈词，只为了这一个卑微的小小功能：
“I JUST WANT TO TURN THE BLOODY USELESS THING OFF - NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.”
还搜到有人发帖对比各家邮件服务，其中 outlook 邮箱专门提醒大家，outlook 不允许关闭垃圾过滤，建议使用别家邮箱服务。
看到这里我已经又愤怒又绝望。不得不打算换掉这个邮箱。这意味着大量的工作：备份所有历史邮件、更新所有网站上的个人信息、解绑各种 app 、更新简历、发邮件通知亲朋好友和同事……
而在这时，我看到了有人分享一个 workaround ( ivasoft.com/fromjunktoinboxflow.shtml )：
使用微软的类 IFTTT 服务 Power Automate ，建立一个自动化 flow：每当收到一封垃圾邮件，自动移动到收件箱。（图 5 ）
测试有效。问题解决。
如果有人看到这条微博，并在使用 outlook 邮箱的。请立刻登录 outlook.com 检查你的垃圾邮件，并考虑切换邮箱服务提供商，或者采用 workaround 。
总而言之，微软在同一个功能上 rape 用户三次：1.zz 的垃圾过滤算法 2.强制使用不许关闭 3.10 天后静默删除。而且在无数用户多年来的反馈抱怨指责痛斥之后————仍然没有修改。
我绞尽脑汁也想不到微软为什么会这样对待消费者。顺带一提，和受无数人诟病且死不悔改的 windows update 强制更新如出一辙，至今也只有 win10 专业版用户使用蹩脚且经常变动的组策略设置才能关闭。
Great job, Microsoft.</span>

1.中学时多学一点多背点单词，成绩确实就会好一点，成绩好了就有老师的偏爱、（也许）光明的前途，但毕业之后少有这般简单线性的模型，技术确实是立身之本，但是技术之于程序员的重要性，可能要小于分数对于学生的重要性，换句话说，在不算热爱的情况下，牺牲下班、周末、爱好，去钻研技术，是否值得？就算值得，仅凭意志力去做，太难了
2.看到了自己的上限，leetcode 前前后后刷了也有三百题了，周赛却从来没 AK 过，大概也看到了自己的上限，身边厉害的同学要么从中学起就开始搞竞赛，要么从大一起就开始疯狂写代码，我这种课正常上、作业正常写、编程作业一半拷贝一半自己写的实在跟他们差的太多。一直想着做点开源，fork 了别人的代码大多数时候都看不懂，技术也只是一方面，简单规划了一下，在最好的情况下（家里不出意外，自己不出意外），也只不过是在将将而立之年背上至少十年的房贷，在一所二线城市有个立锥之地
明天体检周五拿证下周去报道，发个牢骚，希望自己五年后或者十年后能笑对这段话</span>

想部署个 MinIO 给硬件放 BOM 表用的。
1 、现在是 nginx 匹配路由，
例如： https://xxx/service/oss/然后 proxy_pass 到 xxx:9000 端口，匹配的是 /service/oss/这个规则。
但是 MinIO 会直接重定向到 XXX:9001 ，
这个时候导致了错误。
由于我的 nginx 最后有一条 location /的时候都跳转到一个特定的服务器去，所以，MinIO 重定向后找不到资源。
有没有办法 MinIO 重定向后可以让他按照一个规则跳转呢？比如 xxx/service/oss/login/这样子。
2 、还有 MinIO 的 dashboard 怎么支持中文啊。。</span>

                              <span>WestXu: 
当 iPhone 在勿扰模式时，微信视频或语音电话仍然会触发震动。这完全是意外行为，因为勿扰模式连电话都会被屏蔽，但竟然屏蔽不了微信。这样的设计显然会导致不必要的打扰，是令人难以接受的。午休时被吵醒会毁了整个下午。
微信在技术上如何实现突破勿扰模式的，搜了一圈也没有找到。
目前可用的解决方案，但都不完美：
微信设置里关闭“新消息通知-&gt;微信未打开时-&gt;语音和视频通话提醒”。这会导致日常错过微信电话。
勿扰模式自动触发快捷指令，手机进入飞行模式并关掉网络。这会导致睡觉时完全断网，重复呼入的紧急电话也会错过，比较危险，比如失火了也联系不上。
关掉 iPhone 设置里的“声音与触感-&gt;静音模式震动”。但这影响日常使用。如果这个开关提供快捷指令接口也可以解决这个问题，但查了下文档发现没有。但即使有，也会和方案 2 有类似的问题。
转移账号到国际版 WeChat ，最近比较流行的方案。WeChat 使用标准的 Callkit 呼叫接口，可以被 iOS 的勿扰模式管理。但 WeChat 在国内使用可能会有各种问题（尚待考察）。
目前个人暂时使用方案 1 ，并告知家人朋友使用电话或 FaceTime 联系我，不要打微信语音，因为可能被错过。
如果有人有更好的方案，请不吝赐教。</span>

239L 风冷，一级能耗，双变频折扣后价格也就 1599 ，比海尔的同类型比要便宜 200 。

不过翻了好多评论，不少人提到华凌家属于美的子品牌，毕竟是主打低端品控不是很好，甚至还有说美的售后没海尔的好。

目前试驾下来, 基本在汉 dmi 22.58 这款和雅阁混动睿智里选了.
汉 dmi:
优点
内饰好, 功能配置高. 隔音好, 
插混, 能冲电, 绿牌. 这是大优势
但缺点
转弯半径过大, 三连杆, 车道保持功能难用? 后备箱比雅阁小点
小问题多, 已经有多起失速和其他小问题.
现在订单量大, 品控不行. 
方向盘比亚迪祖传右歪?
混动雅阁:
看下来可靠性比比亚迪的车强, 没啥小问题? 动力系统经过市场检验, 已经是比较可靠的了.
后备箱比汉 dmi 大  
缺点
隔音差, 特别是高速, 内饰差, 倒车影像画质的确不高, 自带没 360, 
比汉 dmi 贵 2w.
雅阁 10.5 代取消了 carplay, 但汉 dmi 也没有, 这个算是一样了..
汉 dmi 等 2-3 个月也能接受, 不急着用车, 可以忽略这点.
有这两个车其中之一的 xd, 进来说说感受? 让我参考下, 😅</span>

目前测试了 vncviewer\TightVNC Viewer\MightyViewer ，mac 上开启了屏幕共享，远程链接没问题，体验不太好，卡顿，延时大，内网，外网都不太流畅。内网直接链接，外网通过端口映射、或者 zerotier 或者 wireguard 链接也是延时太大，观察网卡带宽，mac studio 链接 4k 显示器，高峰时能占到 40Mbps 带宽左右，macbook pro 25Mbps 左右，宽带出口带宽都是 100Mbps ，估计是软件优化不太好，软件自带的一些压缩选择似乎没啥作用。

各位老哥,下午好鸭！！！
最近小弟开发一个好玩的东西。
使用 Golang 实现的Vnc远程桌面代理组件，支持远程桌面代理，录屏，回放，截图，录制视频。
完全解析了rfb协议,在写这个项目的过程中，参考了很多项目，感谢各位大神，我也回馈社区。
项目地址: https://github.com/vprix/vncproxy
文档地址: http://vncproxy.vprix.com
这里要特别感谢 V2EX 上的老哥，@vincentcui 他的一篇 rfb 协议的文档让我少走了很多弯路。
他的帖子地址是： https://www.v2ex.com/t/796097
大佬们如果对 vnc 远程桌面有兴趣的可以看一看，我会继续完善这个项目。</span>

阿里 kraken 北海公告：
由于一些不可抗拒的因素，我们目前的贡献者团队将被迫在未来 3 个月内退出，Openkraken TSC (OpenKraken 项目技术指导委员会) 已经安排了一个会议讨论这个问题。 现在我们希望招募社区开发者来持续维护项目。 贡献者团队会确保当前待定的 PR 完成，但是 ROADMAP 中的新功能将暂停，直到我们找到新的贡献者（或团队）。
Openkraken TSC 团队将继续存在并确保本项目持续发展。
我一周前向项目成员染墨发信询问情况，至今还未得到回复。
以下是我对项目状态的一些猜测：
1 ） 与 weex 2.0 技术冲突
weex 与北海功能重叠，阿里决定没必要支持 2 条技术浪费资源。
weex 2.0 基于 fultter engine 渲染, 但是抛弃了 dart vm ，性能应该不会比北海架构差，打包体积因为去掉了 dart 层估计会减少很多。
weex 2.0 的信息可以参考 https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/373582962
2 ）开发团队人员工作任务变更，没有时间资源继续投入。
当然这个是表层原因，深层原因应该还是对项目前景不看好。所以阿里公司决定不再继续投入更多资源。</span>

如题，想要动态编辑列表，用 dnd-kit 作了拖拽，拖拽功能都正常
触发编辑的按钮放在了兄弟组件里，打算用 useContext 共享一些数据
现在的问题是 useContext 能够成功触发改变数据，但是并不会引起组件重绘，导致无法正常控制组件的修改
好奇这是为什么？有什么解决方法？或者是不是有什么更好的做法？
我看还有的博客里直接把 setState 放到了 useContext 里，结果我用的时候直接报 setxxx not a function ，这是不是取巧失败了？参考的是这篇博客 复杂情况下的组件通信 Hooks：useContext

The word metaverse has been thrown around a lot these days. Whether you believe it&#x27;s a reality or not, the adoption of the term has signaled a significant shift in the way people think about the future of online interactions. With today&#x27;s technological advancements and an increase in geographically distributed social circles, the idea of seamlessly connected virtual worlds as part of a metaverse has never felt more appealing.
Virtual worlds enable a wide range of scenarios, and brings to life a rich and vibrant array of experiences. Students can explore the past by stepping inside a past time period, embodying historic figures, and interacting with buildings that were …</span>

As a member of the Fedora Linux QA team, I sometimes find myself executing a bunch of commands that I want to broadcast to other developers. If you&#x27;ve ever used a terminal multiplexer like tmux or GNU Screen, you might think that that&#x27;s a relatively easy task. But not all of the people I want to see my demonstration are connecting to my terminal session from a laptop or desktop. Some might have casually opened it from their phone browser—which they can readily do because I use tmate.

One Punch Man is getting a live-action film adaptation through Sony Pictures that will bring our beloved bald-headed hero, Saitama, and his mechanical sidekick Genos, to life on the big screen, according to a report from Deadline.

Some customers who recently ordered speakers from Sonos’ website received more than what they ordered, which normally wouldn’t be something to complain about — but Sonos charged extra for the devices sent in error and wants them back. While Sonos is providing users with a refund for the additional charges, some are still disappointed they weren’t offered a discount for the inconvenience of dealing with a problem they didn’t cause.
Two separate users told The Verge they placed an order for a single Sonos Move and received three. Another user said they’ve been charged over $2,000 after ordering one Move speaker and receiving a total of seven. They say Sonos has given them a timeframe of up to 10 business days until they get their refund.

The June 2022 edition of Valve’s Steam Next Fest kicked off Monday, and during the weeklong event, you’ll be able to check out hundreds of free demos, according to the company. 
There are seriously a lot of demos — as if there weren’t already a ton of games to play right now — but fortunately, Valve has a few tools to help you sort through what’s available. On the Next Fest page, you can look at different genre pages, and the company also highlights popular upcoming games, most wishlisted upcoming games, and games ranked by daily active demo players. One topping the charts that I have my eye on is Metal: Hellsinger, which is apparently a “rhythm FPS” that’s “brimming with diabolical enemies, powerful weapons, and metal music.” That...

The next time a Google Calendar invitation lands in your inbox, you may notice that it looks a little different. Google announced on Monday that it is making updates to the emails it sends out for calendar events, tweaking them to look more modern and to surface important information quickly.
Google says if an organizer updates an event, the new design will also show you the old information. For example, if an event changes from 1PM to 2PM, you’ll see the 1PM start time crossed out below the new information to give you a better idea of what exactly is happening to your schedule. Google will also tell you what’s changed about an event right up at the top, so you can immediately know what to look for.

While we still don’t know all the nitty-gritty details about Samsung’s next-gen smartwatches, recent FCC filings hint that you can expect at least one big update: faster charging.
FCC filings don’t reveal too much in terms of features, but they are a good indicator that a product is getting close to launch. The filings were first spotted by 9to5Google and indicate there’ll be three models dubbed the SM-R900, the SM-R910, and the SM-R920. They also confirm basic connectivity specs, like the fact that the watches will support Bluetooth, 2.4 and 5Ghz Wi-Fi, and contactless payments. But as far as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 lineup goes, the most eye-catching thing is that the watches can charge at 10W speeds. For context, the Galaxy Watch 4...

Google has placed one of its engineers on paid administrative leave for allegedly breaking its confidentiality policies after he grew concerned that an AI chatbot system had achieved sentience, the Washington Post reports. The engineer, Blake Lemoine, works for Google’s Responsible AI organization, and was testing whether its LaMDA model generates discriminatory language or hate speech. 
The engineer’s concerns reportedly grew out of convincing responses he saw the AI system generating about its rights and the ethics of robotics. In April he shared a document with executives titled “Is LaMDA Sentient?” containing a transcript of his conversations with the AI (after being placed on leave, Lemoine published the transcript via his Medium...

                              <span>这两年提问盒形式的匿名问答越来越多了，像在朋友圈流行的 Popi，在推特流行的那个匿名提问箱，还有以前 QQ 的悄悄话。玩这类匿名社交最有意思的事情就是猜测提问者是谁，提问者提问时的心态。读者在看提问盒的回答历史的时候可以快速建立回答者的初步形象，然后进一步推断作者是一个什么样的人。
匿名？
但是，匿名问答，真的可以匿名吗？很难！数据和流量太过重要，没有人可以舍弃，就算是那些声称极为注重隐私的公司，也会默默收集用户的页面浏览信息（例如浏览时长，用户来源，用户 IP 地址等）。我在最开始的时候并不想收集任何信息，希望做一个完全匿名，没有任何额外信息收集的提问箱，但是后来遇到了轰炸式提问，几分钟发了几十条，非常影响体验，所以我觉得还是要有所限制的（因为需要限定固定 IP 轰炸）。
社交监管？
众所周知，社交类应用有许多的限制，个人基本上不能搞社交类应用，特别是那些想要上架应用市场的，任何 UGC 都是要审查的，而且，网络上鱼龙混杂，难免有脚本小子来轰炸小网站，所以部署在自己的服务器上不是特别安全。
正好没开发过 Vercel 相关的应用，nextjs 也是久闻大名，我想是时候了，该上手试试。
物料准备
本来我想着 vercel 没有配套的数据库服务，用起来会很麻烦，所以就找个 SaaS 平台放数据，于是就想到了以前用过的 LeanCloud，知名的博客评论应用 Valine 就是用的这个服务商，基本上花不了什么钱，而且他们的文档写的很丰富，相当不错。缺点是部分功能需要自己的域名，而且要是备案过的域名。
项目开源地址：https://github.com/TankNee/AnonymousQuestionBox

之前我也打算做一个使用本地数据库的分支，这样就能直接部署到 railway 这样的平台上了（我是快写完了才发现有这样一个平台）。

所以我们需要以下准备：

一个 LeanCloud 账号
一个备案过的域名
一个 GitHub 账号

部署步骤
首先打开 LeanCloud 平台，创建一个新应用：
创建应用
选择免费版即可，完全足够。
然后前往应用的设置-应用凭证页面保存凭证信息：

理论上这个临时服务器地址是可以用的，不过我还是建议使用自己的域名。

然后点击数据存储-结构化数据-创建 Class
创建结构数据类
此处我们需要创建三个类，分别是：

Answer：存放回答
Question：存放提问
Settings：存放一些设置信息，例如页面标题

接下来我们可以点击来在 vercel 上部署提问箱。环境变量需要正确填写，否则可能引发未知错误。

PORT（必需）：运行端口，直接填写 4000 就好。
LEANCLOUD_APP_ID（必需）：填写上文获取到的 LeanCloud 应用 APP ID 信息。
LEANCLOUD_APP_KEY（必需）：填写上文获取到的 LeanCloud 应用 APP KEY 信息。
LEANCLOUD_SERVER_URL（必需）：填写上文获取到的 LeanCloud 应用服务器地址信息。
USER_KEY（必需）：提问箱登录的密码，注意保护隐私。
MAILER_ACCOUNT：SMTP 邮箱账户（为了给提问箱的主人发送邮件，所以需要一个邮箱账号）。
MAILER_PASSWORD：邮箱密码。
MAILER_HOST： SMTP 服务的域名（例如：smtp.163.com）。

填写完成之后等待部署即可！

小红书不是我擅长使用的平台，我在那里也没有多少粉丝。但最近一条关于 Palm 老设备的帖子，却引来了 200 多条评论，而评论内容更是让我泪奔。尤其令我意外的是，因为我提到了煮机社区——我走入互联网行业的第一步、少数派的基础和前身，评论区出现了很多当年的老用户。过去十多年了，他们也许已经为人父母、事业有成，却依然怀念那段美好的时光。
确实，运营煮机社区的三年，也是我最快乐的时光之一：每天折腾自己喜欢的设备和软件，睁开眼睛，就用心阅读和筛选每一条精华帖子，期待着社区里出现的各种牛人。在当时的各类技术社区中，煮机社区肯定不算规模最大、技术最强的，但一定是氛围最好、最尊重用户的。也就是通过运营这样一个社区，让我认识到了互联网「共创」的力量，埋下了做一个共创平台的创业理想。

纵有再好的想法，都要从眼下能做的事情开始。作为白手起家的创业者，先做「内容共创」是最现实可行的切入点。于是，在煮机论坛之后，我们建立了少数派，聚焦「应用推荐」这一垂直领域，摸索出一套作者自由创作，经编辑审改，再精选推荐的独家模式。
值得庆幸的是，少数派的建立适逢移动互联网起飞，应用真正变成了数字生活的入口，知识付费也渐渐兴起。少数派没有将在应用推荐积累的流量直接广告变现，也没有走贩卖焦虑或群组营销的「捷径」。相反，我们选择进一步挖掘应用之后和之上的话题：硬件、服务、场景、生态；凭借在效率工具方面的专业积累，我们也得以初步建立了自己的付费内容体系；虽然内容付费的营收规模不大，但口碑不错，也能一直良性运转和产出。
这个过程中，我们也对于数字生活中的工具、方法与效率有了更…</span>

                              <span>《中国高血压防治指南（2018修订版）》中将有氧运动确定为高血压的防治手段之一，规律的有氧运动在降低血压方面的作用是显著的，长期规律的有氧运动能使高血压患者的收缩压降低12.3mmHg，舒张压降低6.1mmHg。相比于药物治疗，有氧运动的毒副作用小，且经济成本更低。

有氧运动有代替药物治疗的可能吗？
有氧运动能否代替药物治疗则主要取决于患者的血压水平，临床上将血压水平划分为5个等级（详见表 1），从有氧运动引起血压下降的幅度来看，血压处于正常高值范围内的患者从有氧运动中的获益最为明显，规律的有氧运动能够使其血压恢复为正常血压；1级高血压患者在保持良好生活习惯的基础上有可能通过单纯的有氧运动将血压降低至正常范围内；对于2级高血压患者来说，有氧运动则可以作为辅助治疗手段，通过规律的有氧运动可以达到减少服药剂量的目的；而3级高血压患者在有氧运动中通常会面临较高的运动风险，因此不建议在缺少医务监督的情况下单独进行有氧运动。
表 1：血压水平分级
什么样的有氧运动能够有效降低血压？
运动引起的血压降低是有严格触发条件的，并不是“微微出汗”就能达到降低血压的目的。有氧运动由运动周期、运动频率、运动时间、运动强度等几个基本要素组成，持续8周以上、每周3次以上、每次持续20分钟以上的中等强度有氧运动是能够有效降低血压的最低运动标准，以上要素中的任何一个达不到要求都很难使血压降低。
在以上的要素中，运动强度是影响降压效果最为关键，也是最难把控的一个要素，中等及以上的运动强度才能够引起血压的有效降低。运动强度常用最大心率的百分比来界定，如果有可以监测实时心率的手环或手表，在运动中心率达到最大心率的70%即可视为中等强度，最大心率可以通过“220-年龄”来估算。例如，一位30岁的青年人，他的最大心率约为220-30&#x3D;190，190×70%≈133，当他在运动中的心率达到每分钟133次以上时即可…</span>

2022 年是汽车市场出现大变化的一年。新能源车方面，随着国家补贴的退坡和原料市场的涨价，车价明显上涨。去年下定 Model Y 时还犹豫会不会降价，今年提车到手看着涨了几万的车价和愈发变贵的油价，作为车主真的是大喊「真香」。
虽然如今燃油车购置税减半，但考虑到新能源车明年购置税优惠，如果有条件且能接受新能源电车，它们比起燃油车确实更加值得。
和手机取消赠送充电头的风气类似，越来越多的电动车品牌也开始取消赠送家用充电桩。如果你是特斯拉车主，想购买第一方充电桩就要额外加 8000 块。
我自己用 Model Y 没有选择固定充电桩，因为频繁在多个住所流动，所以始终使用便携式充电器——也就是随车充的方案——来解决续航问题。
提车的时候我在天猫买到了一个特斯拉第一方的便携式充电器，2950 元到手。使用特斯拉随车充有一个最麻烦的地方——它必须使用有地线接地的插座供电，我的一处车库插座没有地线，所以使用起来比较麻烦。后来我就买了一个 1000 元出头的普诺得第三方随车充使用，这个可以支持单相电 16A 充电，比起特斯拉随车充要快，一小时充电里程在 25km。我设置晚上 10 点到早上 6 点的谷时电，大概能充 200 公里，自己家里的电费在 10 块钱左右。有了自己的便携式充电器，我的用车电费成本大概 5 分钱 1 公里，是不是比燃油车涨价后的油费香多了？
下面，我就来对比一下两款随车充。
随车充的外观设计与收纳

放在后备箱里，两个随车充的空间旗鼓相当，第三方普诺得的使用了圆包，特斯拉是方包加两个盒子。两个盒子分别是连接 10A…</span>

Hoisting is the default behaviour of JavaScript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.
// Example of Global Scope
hoistedVariable &#x3D; 3;
console.log(hoistedVariable); // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it is initialized   
var hoistedVariable;

// --------------------

// Example of Local Scope
function doSomething(){
  x &#x3D; 33;
  console.log(x); // Outputs 33 since the local variable “x” is hoisted inside the local scope
  var x;
} 

In JavaScript, both the keywords var and let are used to declare variables.
let is block-scope.
var is function scoped.
let does not allow to redeclare variables.
var allows to redeclare variables…</span>

This is a self-contained example of a real-time chart powered by Deno, Web Sockets, Chart.js, and Materialize.
Deno is a simple and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8. Deno, just like Materialize, is also written in Rust.
In this demo, we will build a simple live dashboard app that displays real-time data from a Deno Web Socket server. Deno will then connect to Materialize and TAIL our live materialized view to get the latest data and display it in a real-time chart using Chart.js.
Here is a quick overview of the project:
A mock service to continually generate user score events.
Redpanda instance to store the user score events in a topic.
Materialize instance that is connected to the Redpanda instance and ingests the data from the topic in a live mater…</span>

In my previous article Why CI/CD? How was a life without CI/CD &amp; how is it now? I talked about the Why of CI/CD. If you read that, got the concept and wanna hear more about CI/CD then In this article we are going to ding more into the concepts of CI/CD.
So, 

CI/CD is simply a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. 
CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA &quot;integration hell&quot;).
Specifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to del…</span>

!mc help : shows help
!mc serverusage : shows system load in percentage
!mc serverstatus : shows if the server is online or offline

The purpose of my portfolio is to provide value to other developers from my journey and I hope I make it happen.
As a developer portfolio is something that you must have. It&#x27;s a place where you can share about your projects, education qualifications, journey as a developer, tech stacks, and write blogs on your site.
Portfolio is a digital garden for you
I went through 4 iterations of designing my portfolio.
List of my portfolio iterations are:
1.First Portfolio.

PORTFOLIO 1
Stack Used- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Hosted on netlify.
2.Second Portfolio.

PORTFOLIO 2
Vue and Flask. It looks like some sort of profile page on a social media website.
Stack Used- Vue, Bulma, Flask (For Blogs), frontend on Netlify, backend on Heroku.
3.Third Portfolio

PORTFOLIO 3
Stack Used- Nuxt JS, Bulma, frontend on Netlify, Notion for storing blogs.
4.Portfolio 4 (Current)

PORTFOLIO 3
Stack Used- Nuxt JS, Bulma, frontend on Netlify, Blogs coming soon.

And although I&#x27;m at 800+ articles, I had no idea how many words this was.
So I decided to find a solution to give him an answer and shock myself (and maybe even you?)
This solution will use the command-line interface (CLI), which is the simplest way to do it.
The first step is to count words in some text; luckily for us, Unix already has this command called wc (word count).
To use it, we can simply use a command like this:
wc -w &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;Some random words&quot;

This should output 3 as there are three words in this string.

Now that we know how to count words, we need a way to extract the actual content from our markdown file.
There are several Unix markdown parsers. If you have a favorite …</span>

At this time I already had experiences with several Content Management Systems like Storyblok, Contentful, and Contentstack, so wasn&#x27;t particularly sure how Contentrain will differ from them. Basically, what will make me wanna use Contentrain instead of these already known solutions. 
I thought it will be just another tool that offers exactly same functionality.

My experience with Contentrain was really, really good. It was so great that I decided to write an article about it 🚀
The first step when you create a new account in Contentrain will be this nice looking dashboard with a short tutorial on what you can do with Contentrain

All the code used in this tutorial can be found on my GitHub project: docker-github-runner-linux.
Welcome to Part 2 of my series: Self Hosted GitHub Runner containers on Azure.
In part one of this series, we looked at how we can create a windows container image using docker and then running our self hosted GitHub runners as containers. In this part we will focus on building a Linux based Ubuntu image instead.
In subsequent parts, we will look at how we can utilize Azure to store and run our containers in the cloud using Azure Container Registry (ACR), Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Container Apps (ACA) to run and scale our self hosted GitHub runners, instead of using a VM based approach with docker running inside of a VM.
As also described in part one, before building…</span>

camera
20220613-A7S3
20220613-RED V-RAPTOR

....
当然现在是半成品，期待大佬们点评现在的代码，有什么不足，以及分享思路，万分感谢！！！

这个看到一样的状况开机 cpuIO 直接 50%
然后我就按照上次的方法操作了下,重启后结果直接就无法启动了
直接在内核引导阶段就进不去,然后恢复模式也进不去,我通过 usb 引导 ubuntu 镜像进入了 ecovery 模式下
重建了 /lib64/libstdc++.so 的软链接但是还是无法开机

背景
公司客户多是体制内单位，购买的我司产品部署在客户内网服务器。今天收到一个客户通知，要确认我司产品是否支持迁移到国产化服务器、以及国产操作系统。
注：公司产品后端多是 Java 相关技术栈
咨询请教
我两台主力机器系统都是 Fedora 36 ，所以主观倾向于红帽系。
刚才简单了解了国产操作系统，分类也是不少，银河麒麟、中标麒麟、deepin 、uos 、Anolis OS 、openruler 等等。其中了解到阿里的 Anolis OS 和 CentOS 系统 100% 兼容，所以想测试一下。
另外也想借此帖子，请教一下大家是否有国产操作系统部署维护相关的经验、以及国产系统推荐。谢谢！！</span>

小米刚开始搞移动通信业务的时候，为了营销推过那种没有月租的电话卡，我觉得充 100 块钱就能弄一个手机号以后用来对付装修电话什么的也挺合适，就买了一个，期间一直没怎么用，也相安无事。
3 月份的时候，我装那个电话卡的旧手机接到一个短信，说是根据《反恐怖主义法》《网络安全法》，我的号码异常，必须进行二次实名验证，我也没想太多，可能以前的实名制不充分，要补录一个就借了一部安卓手机进行验证了（人家只支持安卓），验证之严格程度让人大开眼界，你不仅要提供身份证这样的常规操作，还要对着屏幕上给你提供的稿子现场进行录像，大概内容就是，我叫 xx ，我的身份证是 xxx ，今天是 x 年 x 月 x 日，我保证是我本人，且不用这个电话诈骗等等，犯人体验感十足。
验证通过后的 3 个月后，也就是前几天，我又收到了同样内容的短信又让我来一次，说我的号码异常，问题是我这个号本身就很少使用啊，我打电话申诉，对面一度让我确认是不是机器人客服，完全不解释异常原因，不停的重复因为网络优化，这边要你进行申诉的。（小米移动管强制用户进行二次实名验证叫网络优化，二次实名验证的入口叫申诉），反正就是不给你判断异常出现的原因，不进行处理。
然后我把事实证据包括，电话详单、证明我的号 3 个月前已经通过实名制验证的证据提交到工信部申诉，小米 1 天后来电话了，终于来一个不像机器人的客服了，不过也最多是中级客服，告知我是长期没有使用被列为异常，这就很有意思了：
1 ）“长期”如何定义？我 3 月下旬给我的另一个手机号还发过一次付费短信，事发还不到 3 个月，就算长期不使用了？
2 ）“使用”如何定义？我把手机卡插在手机里 24 小时保持畅通就不算使用？那你用微博只浏览不发东西也不算用微博了？
3 ）有哪条法律法规、以及签署的合同规定用户使用手机必须一个月（小米客服后来提供的标准）发一次短信或者电话，否则就必须再次实名制验证？ 24 小时不验证就停机？用户怎么用手机你小米管的着么？
当然沟通结果还是客服虽然无法辩驳，但是这是他们的规定没有办法，一如既往的复合预期。
今日我发现我的号被停机了，打电话询问小米客服，说这就是最终的处理方法，不予以开通，你要想开通就进行申诉，我询问我不懂你说的申诉是什么意思，是否就是那个要现场录像拍身份证的那个东西，她说是，那个入口的名称叫申诉。
我今天又向工信部投诉了一次，因为我已经被违法停机了，我对处理结果其实并不乐观，大企业跟你耍流氓人家拿工资的，有钱有人有时间，你普通人生活已经够难了还要应付这些事情，为了维权做实力明显不对等的对抗，如果没有国家法律撑腰、处罚震慑，难办的很。
我其实对那些女性客服感到有些愧疚，因为你要维权就必须摆出一种“战斗姿态”，那些女性客服承担了用户的质疑与怒火，但是问题肯定不是出在她们身上，有时候听到对面小心翼翼、唯唯诺诺的声音，真是让人感到众生皆苦，她们本不应该承受这些，但是我也得维权啊，虽然她们肯定看不到这些，我还是想在互联网上留下对她们的愧疚，唉。
我不知道就这么点事儿，花那么多时间处理是否明智，目前我在等待申诉结果，可能会像众多类似事情一样无疾而终吧，也许正是领教过的一次次的不公让年轻人失去朝气变成了油腻中年，我希望处理结果能给自己，也给大伙儿打一打气

趁着高考结束后闲着无事，入门了网页和小程序开发，刚学完 ajax 没多久，打算写一个小项目作为总结，于是便有了此项目。
本项目基于前端请求后端、后端记录数据的方式统计访客数据，使得静态网站也拥有了展示访客数据的功能。且本项目还利用了 cookies 来防止重复提交数据，确保记录真实访问量。本来是想只给自己的网站用的，但后面还是决定开源了（虽然 js 脚本开不开源都无所谓）。
后端搭建在了腾讯云的 serverless 云函数上，国内访问速度应该是有保证的，经过测试响应时间均不超 50ms ，个人感觉还是相当不错的。
项目地址： https://github.com/zhishixiang/visitorStatistic ，由于刚学没多久因此代码非常烂，希望大佬们轻喷。</span>

场景
我方提供一些路由器或软路由，提供 VPN 接入我方内部网络，用于业务测试。
由于使用人员并非完全是技术人员，因此要求对方能够使用 iptables 是比较困难的。
所以是否有一些现成图形化的方式，能够让使用人员设置一些静态路由。
需求
根据来源 IP 指定出口接口
根据来源 MAC 指定出口接口
根据目标 IP 指定出口接口
除了依据上述规则指定出口的请求以外，均通过默认出口以方便使用人员
补充
使用人员之前有 RouterOS 使用经验，能够达到类似 ROS 的图形化功能就够。</span>

之前给父母买了多年微医保，今年春节得了重疾在北京住院手术，之后申请赔付
保险公司（泰康保险）以“疫情期间难以调查”直接强行终止流程了；要求我过几个月再提交试试，不行就再试；
我觉得很可笑，我怎么知道保险公司什么时候能『恢复调查』遂投诉到保监局，确实来了专人跟进语气可好了但是提交了各种材料又一个半月了无下文；然后上个月和我对接的那个专人离职跑路了。。
问下有没有相同情况的老哥或者有保险行业同学解下惑，是这个保险公司不靠谱还是真的疫情原因？我是不是只能再次投诉了？微医保应该卖的很好吧，难道今年要求赔付的都赔不了？说实在的医保已经 cover 70%了，轮到保险公司赔付的可能就两三万，我这几年交的保费都得五六千了，就这点赔付还整的这么费劲我真是对国内的保险到底能不能做好『家庭容灾』持怀疑态度。信心都没了。</span>

活动背景
当业务发展、技术迭代、人才需求都在红利期时，一线城市的企业，一般会做适当超量的人才储备，为潜在的业务爆发做好规划，IT 就业环境相对乐观。
而现在，都“卷”到边了。各个团队被迫选择保留核心业务的支持团队，度过艰难期。在这个过程中，我们看到了有一部分同学，处在了自己的临界点。借用小编最近看到的一句话：每一次“毕业”，都是一次新生的机会。
希望，我们这次活动，可以让大家减少焦虑。如果能解决大家的部分实际问题，那就更好了。

谷歌的一位 AI 工程师 Blake Lemoine，从去年秋天开始与公司的聊天机器人 LaMDA 对话。LaMDA 运用了谷歌最先进的大型语言模型，使用从互联网上收集的数万亿词汇进行训练。在与 LaMDA 交流期间，他认为 AI 有了意识。比如他问 LaMDA 最害怕什么？LaMDA 回答说，它恐惧于被关闭。他继续追问：就像死亡？LaMDA 说：就像是死亡。因此，Blake 认为这证明 LaMDA 有了意识。在向上级展示了证据无果后他决定公开这件事，然后被公司勒令休假。在被封锁账号前，他给有 200 人的谷歌机器学习列表发帖说，“LaMDA 是有意识的，……是一个可爱的孩子，……我不在的时候请好好照顾它。”不独是 Blake，也有其它谷歌专家认为神经网络这种模仿人脑的架构，正在向意识迈进。

因硬盘故障，数十个 GitLab 开源项目开发受阻

FreeDesktop.org 的 GitLab 服务承载着 Mesa、X.Org、Wayland，以及 LibreOffice 和 GStreamer 等开源项目。由于硬盘故障，FreeDesktop.org 的 GitLab 从 11 日某个时间开始一直处于关闭状态，并且没有恢复正常的预告时间。管理员们在努力恢复硬盘 RAID，但到目前为止没有结果。而且，两位管理员还宣布要休息一天。

                              <span>前一段时间，我的老朋友淮晋阳跟我说，为什么不将一些文章变成朗读版的呢？这样可以让更多喜欢听朗读的爱好者们“听到”，而不是“看到”开源的文章？对于这样的建议，我欣然采纳。于是，我们发起了一个新的朗读栏目：开源朗读者。对一些文章，尤其是一些评论性的文章，进行了朗读配音。

很快，在淮晋阳制作出第一篇朗读版的《Linux 太难了吗？你需要了解这五点》，并在他的带动下，张锦航、若愚、六开箱等开源贡献者们也纷纷加入了朗读者行列，还有更多的开源朗读者们也在积极录制中。感兴趣加入开源朗读者行列的，请微信公众号内私信我。

在这些音频发布后，我们也收到了一些播客爱好者的建议，希望在通用的播客客户端上也能订阅、收听到这些有意义的音频节目。

在我们的技术合伙人白宦成的支持下，很快，我们就开发了两个播客频道：


开源朗读者：由朗读者们深情朗读各种值得分享给大家的文章，一般时长在 10 分钟左右。

硬核观察：这是对我们每天的《硬核观察》栏目的音频重制，一般时长在 3 分钟左右。


这两个播客频道可以在喜马拉雅应用上根据名称搜索到；也可以苹果的“播客”、“小宇宙”等通用型播客客户端搜索到。如果你搜索不到，也可以直接输入它们的 RSS 地址：

                              <span>6 月 13 日，阿里云智能总裁张建锋在峰会上正式发布 CIPU（Cloud infrastructure Processing Units），这是为新型云数据中心设计的专用处理器，未来将替代 CPU 成为云计算的管控和加速中心。

在这个全新体系架构下，CIPU 向下对数据中心的计算、存储、网络资源快速云化并进行硬件加速，向上接入飞天云操作系统，将全球数百万台服务器连成一台超级计算机。 



阿里云智能总裁张建锋发布 CIPU

例如，CIPU 与计算结合，快速接入不同类型资源的服务器，带来算力的“0”损耗，以及硬件级安全的加固隔离；CIPU 与存储结合，对存算分离架构的块存储接入进行硬件加速，云盘存储 IOPS 最高可达 300 万，长尾时延降低 50%；CIPU 与网络结合，可对高带宽物理网络进行硬件加速，构建大规模弹性 RDMA 高性能网络，时延最低可达 5us。



CIPU 架构示意图

基于 CIPU 和飞天的新一代云计算架构体系，在通用计算、大数据、人工智能等核心场景的计算测试中展现了优越的性能。在通用分布式计算领域，Redis 性能提升了 68%、MySQL 提升了 60%，Nginx 提升了 30%；高吞吐类的互联网业务上云之后，比自建物理机的集群吞吐量提升了 30%，业务高峰期延迟下降了 90%；在大数据和AI等计算与数据双密集场景下，相比传统的 TCP 网络，弹性 RDMA 高性能网络的吞吐能力提升 30% 以上；云原生方面，容器启动速度快了 350%，在 Serverless 场景下 6 秒可拉起 3000 个弹性容器实例。



CIPU 特性简介

为什么要有 CIPU？张建锋认为，过去十多年，云计算技术经历了两个发展阶段：第一阶段是分布式和虚拟化技术替代了大型机，满足了当时企业所需的算力规模；第二阶段出现了资源池化技术，以阿里巴巴为例，通过计算存储分离架构，将计算、存储、网络资源分别池化，突破了规模和稳定性的瓶颈，提供了超大规模的云计算服务。

但随着数据密集型计算场景的普及，用户对低时延、高带宽的需求也越来越高，传统以 CPU 为中心的计算体系架构无法适应这一趋势。为了解决这一问题，阿里云相关研发团队早在 2015 年就开始技术攻关，并于 2017 年推出业内首款虚拟化损耗为零的神龙云服务器。经过多年自研迭代，神龙、弹性 RDMA 等核心技术不断深入垂直整合，演进出以 CIPU 为中心的全新架构形态，云计算开始进入第三阶段。

阿里云还不断夯实技术底座，建立了自研的芯片、服务器、飞天操作系统等软硬一体的基础设施。这些基础设施有力支撑了阿里云产品的四大核心：神龙计算、盘古存储、洛神网络和安全内核。在国际权威机构 Gartner 发布的年度报告里，阿里云获得计算、存储、网络、安全 4 项单项最高分以及 IaaS 整体基础设施能力的全球最高分。</span>

Proven 指出，Distrowatch 目前列出了多达 270 个 Linux 发行版。当然，没有人能够都一一了解所有的这些发行版。但是，甚至在 GNOME 和 KDE 的界面大辩论之前，从 Bash 和 Zsh 之争开始，我就一直在报道 Linux 桌面，并且曾经是一本现在已经停刊的名为《Linux 桌面》杂志的主编，我想我比任何其他用过 Windows PC 之外的计算机的人使用过更多的桌面。简而言之，我超爱 Linux 桌面。

许多 Linux 桌面发行版都很棒。多年来，我一直是 Linux Mint 的忠实粉丝。我也很喜欢其它桌面发行版：Fedora、openSUSE、Ubuntu 和 MX Linux，排名不分先后。但是你知道吗？这就是问题。

我们有很多优秀的 Linux 桌面发行版，但这意味着它们中没有一个能获得足够的市场份额，从而在 整个市场 上产生任何真正的影响。

自从人们开始谈论何时 Linux 能在桌面上击败 Windows 以来，情况一直如此。尽管我们可能梦想着一个真正的 Linux 桌面年到来，但它从未到来。正如 Forrester 高级分析师 Andrew Hewitt 最近指出的那样，“总的来说，只有 1% 的员工 报告说他们用于工作的主要笔记本电脑使用了 Linux。而 60%的人仍在使用 Windows……。Linux 不太可能超越 Windows 成为主要操作系统&quot;。

他没有说错。

这并不是说 Linux 不能成为一个成功的终端用户环境。事实上，它是，你可以说 Linux 是最成功的终端用户操作系统，而不是 Windows。这是因为现在有 超过 30 亿部安卓手机，而安卓只是…</span>

Android中消息总线的几种实现方式
前言
消息总线又叫事件总线，为什么我们需要一个消息总线呢？是因为随着项目变大，页面变多，我们可能出现跨页面、跨组件、跨线程、跨进程传递消息与数据，为了更方便的直接通知到指定的页面实现具体的逻辑，我们需要消息总线来实现。
从最基本的 BroadcastReceiver 到 EventBus 再到RxBus ,后来官方出了AndroidX jetpack 我们开始使用LiveDataBus，最后到Kotlin的流行出来了FlowBus。我们看看他们是怎么一步一步演变的。
一、BroadcastReceiver 广播
我们再初入 Android 的时候都应该学过广播接收者，分为静态广播和动态注册广播，在高版本的 Android 中限制了我们一些静态广播的使用，不过我们还是能通过动态注册的方式获取一些系统的状态改变。像常用的电量变化、网络状态变化、短信发送接收的状态等等。
比如网络变化的监听：
    IntentFilter intentFilter &#x3D; new IntentFilter(ConnectivityManager.CONNECTIVITY_ACTION);
    application.getApplicationContext().registerReceiver(InstanceHolder.INSTANCE, intentFilter);

在消息中线中，我们可以使用本地广播来实现 LocalBroadcastManager 消息的通知。

前言
ASM字节码插桩技术在Android开发中有着广泛的应用，但相信很多人会不知道怎么上手，不知道该拿ASM来做点什么。
学习一门技术最好的方法就是动手实践，本文主要通过ASM插桩采集方法的入参，出参及耗时信息并打印，通过一个不大不小的例子快速上手ASM插桩开发。
技术目标
我们先看下最终的效果
插桩前代码
首先来看下插桩前代码，就是一个sum方法
    private fun sum(i: Int, j: Int): Int {
        return i + j
    }

插桩后代码
接下来看下插桩后的代码
    private final int sum(int i, int j) {
        ArrayList arrayList &#x3D; new ArrayList();
        arrayList.add(Integer.valueOf(i));
        arrayList.add(Integer.valueOf(j));
        MethodRecorder.onMethodEnter(&quot;com.zj.android_asm.MainActivity&quot;, &quot;sum&quot;, arrayList);
        int i2 &#x3D; i + j;
        MethodRecorder.onMethodExit(Integer.valueOf(i2), &quot;com.zj.android_asm.MainActivity&quot;, &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;I,I&quot;, &quot;I&quot;);
        return i2;
    }

这是 MVI 架构的第三篇，系列文章目录如下：
Android 架构之 MVI 雏形 | 响应式编程 + 单向数据流 + 唯一可信数据源
Android 架构之 MVI 初级体 | Flow 替换 LiveData 重构数据链路
Android 架构之 MVI 完全体 | 重新审视 MVVM 之殇（PartialChange &amp; Reducer）
其中第一篇剖析了 MVI 的概念，第二篇是 MVI 在项目实战中的初级应用，而这一篇将重构上篇的代码，以展示 MVI 的完全体。
引子
在上一篇中，用 MVI 重构了“新闻流”这个业务场景。本篇在此基础上进一步拓展，引入 MVI 中两个重要的概念PartialChange和Reducer。
假设“新闻流”这个业务场景，用户可以触发如下行为：
初始化新闻流
上拉加载更多新闻
举报某条新闻
在 MVVM 中，这些行为被表达为 ViewModel 的一个方法调用。在 MVI 中被称为意图Intent，它们不再是一个方法调用，而是一个数据。通常可被这样定义：
sealed class FeedsIntent {
    data class Init(val type: Int, val count: Int) : FeedsIntent()
    data class More(val timestamp: Long, val count: Int) : FeedsIntent()
    data class Report(val id: Long) : FeedsIntent()
}

这样做使得界面意图都以数据的形式流入到一个流中，好处是，可以用流的方式统一管理所有意图。更详细的讲解可以点击Android 架构之 MVI | 响应式编程 + 单向数据流…</span>

这次的 Flutter 小技巧是字体渲染，虽然是小技巧但是内容略长，可能大家在日常开发中不会特别关心字体相关的部分，而这将是一篇你平时可能用不到 ，但是遇到问题就会翻出来的文章。
本篇将快速普及一些字体渲染相关的基础，解决一些因为字体而导致的异常问题，并穿插一些实用小技巧，内容篇幅可能略长，建议先 Mark 后看。
一、字体库
首先，问一个我经常问的面试题：Flutter 在 Android 和 iOS 上使用了哪些字体？
如果你恰好看过 typography.dart 的源码和解释，你可以会有初步结论：
Android 上使用的是 Roboto 字体；
iOS 上使用的是 .SF UI Display 或者 .SF UI Text 字体；

但是，如果你再进一步去了解就会发现，在加上中文显示之后，结论应该是：
默认在 iOS 上：

中文字体：PingFang SC (繁体还有 PingFang TC 、 PingFang HK    )
英文字体：.SF UI Text  / .SF UI Display
默认在 Android 上：

中文字体：Source Han Sans / Noto
英文字体：Roboto
那这时候你可能会问：.SF 没有中文，那可以使用 PingFang 显示英文吗？ 答案是可以的，但是字形和字重会有微妙区别， 例如下图里的 G 就有很明显的不同。

那如果加上韩文呢？这时候 iOS 上的  PingFang  和 .SF  就不够用了，需要调用如  Apple SD Gothic Neo  这样的超集字体库，而说到这里就需要介绍一个 Flutter 上你可能会遇到的 Bug。
如下图所示，当在使用  Apple SD Gothic Neo  字体出现中文和韩文同时显示时，你可能会察觉一些字形很奇怪，比如【推…</span>

希望对你有所帮助 🤣🤣
知乎的 Matisse 应该蛮多 Android 开发者有了解过或者是曾经使用过，这是知乎在 2017 年开源的一个 Android 端图片选择框架，其颜值在现在看来也还是挺不错的

可惜近几年知乎官方已经不再对 Matisse 进行维护更新了，上一次提交记录还停留在 2019 年，累积了 400 个 issues 一直没人解答，很多高版本系统的兼容性问题和内部 bug 也一直得不到解决。我反编译了知乎的 App，发现其内部还保留着 Matisse 的相关代码，所以知乎应该不是完全废弃了 Matisse，而只是不再开源了
我公司的项目也使用到了 Matisse，随着 Android 系统的更新，时不时地就会有用户来反馈问题，无奈我也只能 fork 了源码自己来维护。一直这么小修小补终究不太合适，而且如果不进行完全重写的话，Matisse 的一些交互体验问题也没法得到彻底解决，而这些问题在知乎目前的官方 App 上也一样存在，以修改个人头像时打开的图片选择页面为例：

我发现的问题有三个：
知乎的用户头像不支持 Gif 格式，当用户点击 Gif 图片时会提示 “不支持的文件类型”。按我的想法，既然不支持 Gif 格式，那么一开始展示的时候就应该过滤掉才对，而知乎目前的筛选逻辑应该就是来源自 Matisse ，因为 Matisse 也不支持 只展示静态图，但又可以 只展示 Gif，这筛选逻辑我觉得十分奇怪
当取消勾选静态图时，可以看到 Gif 图片会很明显地闪烁了一下，此问题在 Matisse 中也存在。而如果从知乎的编辑器进入图片选择页面的话，就不单单是 Gif 图片会闪烁了，而是整个页面都会闪烁一下…
当点击下拉菜单时，可以看到 Pictures …</span>

Astra’s Launch Vehicle 0010 (LV0010) successfully took off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 1:43PM ET, but suffered an upper stage failure about 10 minutes into its flight. The launch was part of NASA’s mission to send six TROPICS satellites into space — these small, foot-long CubeSats are supposed to help NASA keep better track of developing tropical storms. CubeSats are low-cost satellites frequently built by researchers at colleges and universities.

Starfield is, naturally, set in space where players will take on the role of a last group of explorers. Described as “Skyrim in space,” by game director Todd Howard, the RPG will be playable in both first- and third-person, but primarily it’s first-person.
During the early stages of the gameplay, we arrive on the moon of Kreet, just one of more than 1,000 planets that players will be able to fly to and explore freely. Powered by Bethesda’s new Creation Engine 2, the first Starfield gameplay shows a player freely roaming...

Three beloved JRPGs in the Persona franchise — Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 Royal — are coming to Xbox and PC, Microsoft announced at its Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.
The first will be Persona 5 Royal, which will be available on October 21st. Currently, that game is only available on PlayStation platforms, so the upcoming Xbox and PC release marks a notable expansion for the game. If you haven’t played it before, I cannot recommend the game enough — it absolutely oozes style, and by the end of the game, you’ll really feel like you connect with the many characters you meet.
Person 3 Portable originally appeared on the PSP back in 2006. Persona 4 Golden was a port of Persona 4 that originally appeared on the PS...

Diablo IV, the next major release in Activision Blizzard’s popular dungeon-crawling series, will be available in 2023, the company announced Sunday. When it launches, it’ll be available on PC, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4, and the game will have crossplay and cross-progression across all platforms. And as with previous Diablo games there will be blood — a lot of it. Whole actual waves of blood.
In addition to previously announced classes like the sorceress, barbarian, druid, and rogue, Activision Blizzard revealed the fifth playable class: Necromancer. “Fight with aggressive skeleton Warriors, fast-attacking Skirmishers, sword and board Defenders, or scythe-wielding Reapers,” the company said in a press release. “Unleash a...

Overwatch 2 will be launching “in early access” on October 4th, Activision Blizzard announced Sunday. At least the PVP parts of it will be. And in a major change, it will be free to play — the original Overwatch was a paid title. It will be releasing on PC, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. 
“We can’t wait to roll out the beginning of the Overwatch 2 experience on October 4 and introduce an exciting new competitive vision, featuring amazing new content and a reimagining of the iconic heroes, maps, and gameplay that made the original game so compelling,” Mike Ybarra, president of Blizzard, said in a press release. “This is the beginning of an always-on and always-evolving era for the franchise, and a recommitment...

Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 indie side-scrolling action platformer Hollow Knight, is coming to Xbox, Microsoft announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase on Sunday. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass the day it’s released.
While there’s no official release date, Xbox exec Sarah Bond said during the showcase that all of the games shown during the event will be available in the next 12 months. The official Xbox Twitter account confirmed that timeline, so we at least have a window of time for when we can expect the game.
That&#x27;s exactly what we said.

                              <span>What if you need to show in your app today&#x27;s BTC/USD price? Or convert the user&#x27;s balance from ETH to BTC? Or are you building an Elon Musk fan site and want to provide the latest Tesla (TSLA) stock price updates?
Chainlink to retrieve the latest assets prices in a single call and provide it to your app components using React Context
The easiest and quickest way to do that is to use the data feed provided by Chainlink. We will use the ETH/USD pair as an example.
First, we need to find the contract&#x27;s address for our pair to call to. There is a handy address&#x27;s list for every pair supported by Chainlink.

ABI. We will use Ethers.js library to help us with it (you could also use Web3.js, it doesn&#x27;t matter here).

                              <span>👋, I am here with another list. In this post I have enlisted 15 aesthetic color gradients using CSS (examples of colour gradients in CSS) which you can implement in your next projects.
I have used linear-gradient method of CSS and only the gradient direction &#x27;to bottom left&#x27;. There are many others gradient directions like &#x27;to right&#x27;, &#x27;to top&#x27; etc. to read about the linear-gradient method you can refer to this freecodecamp article.
Let&#x27;s jump into the list:

The website is so cool, and so well thought out, it was just perfect. I really encourage you to look at all the videos, it&#x27;s pretty hackery.😀 
When you&#x27;re ready, put on your FSOCIETY hoodie and let&#x27;s hack the world!
Once your machine is loaded, we can start with our basic enumeration. First things first, when we open up the IP address of the machine in our browser we are met with a command-line like website. Each command that you type in will load a video, so it&#x27;s not really that important (but you can check it out if you want). 

Let&#x27;s run an nmap scan to see if we can find any services.
nmap -sV -Pn 

Mhh, we can see that our ssh port is…</span>

                              <span>Welcome friends to this new blog post where I will teach you how to use CRUD functions using Prisma(ORM tool) with the help of Nextjs (API folder).
First, you have to setup Prisma in your Nextjs app 👇
Get Started with Prisma and Nextjs with Supabase (Postgress Database)
So, let’s begin

First, you need to install 2 packages
yarn add react-hot-toast swr


prisma migrate dev

If you don’t have any GUI tool for managing your data in the database. Then you can write this command
prisma studio

That will open up a website at localhost:5555, by which you can manage your data quickly.
First, you need to create a form.

To create that, make a file named — profiles.ts in your API folder in the pages folder.

Then write this code 👇
//@ts-ignore in 18th line helps to ignore the type error.

Now you can try the **create **command.
If you encounter any error, then observe your console logs.

                              <span>Regarding Terminals, our developers are susceptible. We love our terminal as it&#x27;s our home base.
So whenever a new terminal pops up, I have to try it at least.
I love and use iTerm2 for almost everything. But Warp is the new kid on the block, and although it comes with some downsides, it&#x27;s pretty slick!
Try our Warp here
This new terminal is made from scratch, not based on what we already know about terminals.
This, to me, is what makes it so cool. The whole terminal experience changes and makes it feel like a native app.
It&#x27;s super quick to autocomplete and separate commands, so it&#x27;s easy to understand which output belongs to which command.
Besides these apparent wins, it&#x27;s also super fast and comes with Intellisense for npm and git. You&#x27;ll never forget a command this way.

To be honest, there are always downsides, aren&#x27;t there.
It&#x27;s only available for Mac, but the team seems to be working hard on a Windows and Linux version.
It&#x27;s not open source, this might not be a bad hard point, but for some people, that&#x27;s a deal-breaker.
You need to log in, which seems weird to use a terminal.
I hope they are not using this personal data to keep track of our terminal usage, as it&#x27;s now connected to a user profile.
Worth a try if you&#x27;re on Mac. It&#x27;s pretty awesome to use.

There are lots of sites on web which offers you online tools. Most of them focus on specific topics and they mostly have outdated designs which makes you think &quot;Am I in 90&#x27;s?&quot;. When you start to bookmark the tools you needed, the list becomes larger and larger in some point.
10015 Tools solves all these problems. So, bookmark it and forget about all other tool sites.
10015.io is designed and coded by Fatih Telis (me) as a side project. I am a frontend developer based in Istanbul, Turkey. I started this project to build a platform which will work as an all-in-one toolbox while I&#x27;m challenging myself to create tools which does many different things. Even though I&#x27;m not a professional designer, I&#x27;m doing my best to construct a simple, aesthetic and easy-to-use UI system. You can contact me via email or Twitter about anything.

Every successful project has been planned before. Similarly, in this phase contributors connect with respective mentors and discuss the project deliverables, plan the project and finalize the scope of the Project.
I was so happy after getting selected for GSoC, especially with CircuitVerse. After getting selected, our private channel was created and all the contributors, mentors, and OA were there. We had our first meeting on 26th May, and we were welcomed by our mentors, I meet my mentors Aboobacker, Pavan, Samiran, Ayan, Ruturaj, and contributors Pulkit, Devjit, and Aman. It was a pleasure meeting them all. We had a great meeting and our mentors told us about the flow of the GSoC at CircuitVerse.

HTML All The Things is a web development podcast and discord community which was started by Matt and Mike, developers based in Ontario, Canada. 
The podcast speaks to web development topics as well as running a small business, self-employment and time management. You can join them for both their successes and their struggles as they try to manage expanding their Web Development business without stretching themselves too thin.
This week, Matt and Mike discussed how to think like a programmer. When you&#x27;re learning to code you may think that syntax is the most important thing since it is so hard to memorize. The problem with memorizing syntax is that if you ever need to move on to a new programming language, you&#x27;ll have to start memorizing all over again. Instea…</span>

                              <span>Hello World !
S Soumyakanta.
It&#x27;s important to learn things in a structured way. After all I found Free Code Camp  on web and Youtube. As a beginner I was making the same mistake again and again. But from the Free Code Camp&#x27;s Youtube channel I found Per Harald Borgen&#x27;s free beginner level full Javascript course. It was a interactive course on Scrimba.com.
It was important for me to practice online to boost my journey. I know you may ask their are many online code learning platform&#x27;s then why Scrimba !!! then here are some answers why as newbie should learn JS from Scimba&#x27;s Learn JavaScript for free !
1. If you haven&#x27;t a high end device:- For this course you only need a PC(1 GB Ram),Internet and a browser(Chrome suggested). Your journey will not stop due to lack of resources. You don&#x27;t need to run several application to start.
2.If you&#x27;re a beginner:-I struggled hard to learn code by self ,in the way to my web development journey. I love to learn things by doing practical application in real world. This course will teach you Javascript by creating three projects like Passenger counter app, Blackjack game and a chrome extension.
3.Fun and Zero distraction:- While learning from Youtube as a newbie I was so distracted by other recommended videos. In this course it was simple for me to stay focused. This course is amazingly delivered by Mr. Per . You will learn several things by doing challenges in this course.
My Suggestion to beginners:-After searching several platform&#x27;s  I would suggest to learn Javascript from Scrimba. Don&#x27;t waste so much time on watching random videos one after one to learn. It&#x27;s a 7 hour long video and I assure you that you&#x27;re  going to enjoy it.
For Mr. Per:- Hello sir ! thanks for your teaching. Your course impacted my life. It&#x27;s my humble gratitude to you. Thanks a lot.
I hope this review will help you to start journey in a productive way.
If you are reading this I will happy that we will stay connected. Here is my social media links below  !

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>My thanks to everybody who follows to this tenth, the last blog of JS hint.
1. Accessors
Do not use JavaScript getters/setters as they cause unexpected side effects and are harder to test, maintain, and reason about. Instead, if you do make accessor functions, use getVal() and setVal(&#x27;hello&#x27;).
// bad
class Dragon {
  get age() {
    // ...
  }

  set age(value) {
    // ...
  }
}

// good
class Dragon {
  getAge() {
    // ...
  }

  setAge(value) {
    // ...
  }
}

If the property/method is a boolean, use isVal() or hasVal().
// bad
if (!dragon.age()) {
  return false;
}

// good
if (!dragon.hasAge()) {
  return false;
}

It’s okay to create get() and set() functions, but be consistent.
class Jedi {
  constructor(options &#x3D; {}) {
    const lightsaber &#x3D; options.lightsaber || &#x27;blue&#x27;;
    this.set(&#x27;lightsaber&#x27;, lightsaber);
  }

  set(key, val) {
    this[key] &#x3D; val;
  }

  get(key) {
    return this[key];
  }
}

2. Events
// bad
$(this).trigger(&#x27;listingUpdated&#x27;, listing.id);

// ...

$(this).on(&#x27;listingUpdated&#x27;, (e, listingID) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // do something with listingID
});

// good
$(this).trigger(&#x27;listingUpdated&#x27;, { listingID: listing.id });

// ...

$(this).on(&#x27;listingUpdated&#x27;, (e, data) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // do something with data.listingID
});

3. jQuery
// bad
const sidebar &#x3D; $(&#x27;.sidebar&#x27;);

// good
const $sidebar &#x3D; $(&#x27;.sidebar&#x27;);

// good
const $sidebarBtn &#x3D; $(&#x27;.sidebar-btn&#x27;);

// bad
function setSidebar() {
  $(&#x27;.sidebar&#x27;).hide();

  // ...

  $(&#x27;.sidebar&#x27;).css({
    &#x27;background-color&#x27;: &#x27;pink&#x27;,
  });
}

// good
function setSidebar() {
  const $sidebar &#x3D; $(&#x27;.sidebar&#x27;);
  $sidebar.hide();

  // ...

  $sidebar.css({
    &#x27;background-color&#x27;: &#x27;pink&#x27;,
  });
}

For DOM queries use Cascading $(&#x27;.sidebar ul&#x27;) or parent &gt; child $(&#x27;.sidebar &gt; ul&#x27;). jsPerf
Use find with scoped jQuery object queries.
// bad
$(&#x27;ul&#x27;, &#x27;.sidebar&#x27;).hide();

// bad
$(&#x27;.sidebar&#x27;).find(&#x27;ul&#x27;).hide();

// good
$(&#x27;.sidebar ul&#x27;).hide();

// good
$(&#x27;.sidebar &gt; ul&#x27;).hide();

// good
$sidebar.find(&#x27;ul&#x27;).hide();

Thanks for your time.

在 1976 年夏天，来自世界各地的数十位计算机领域的顶级工程师、科学家和软件先锋们聚集在一起，在美国洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室聚会了五天，回顾了计算机界的前 25 年历史。在这些修复的视频中，与会者们讲述了许多当时鲜为人知的事情。比如，美国最早的大型电子计算机 ENIAC 的共同发明人约翰•毛奇里讨论了它的严重问题，ENIAC 必须每天 24 小时保持通电，以保持其 18000 个真空管的健康。计算机历史学家布莱恩•兰德尔教授首次披露了英国二战时期破译德军密码的专用计算机，还介绍了艾伦•图灵在二战时发挥的重大作用。

秘密运行中的世界上最强大的超级计算机

在最近一期的 TOP500 中，美国橡树岭国家实验室建造的 Frontier 以第一个 E 级超算夺得了榜首。TOP500 测量的是一台机器通过运行名为 LINPACK 基准的软件解决大量方程式的速度，这给出了一个以每秒浮点运算（FLOPS）为单位的数值。但并不是所有的超级计算机都会被列出，只有在其所有者运行该基准并提交结果的情况下才会出现在榜单。很多机构，包括一些大学都不会提交其基准数据来加入榜单。超级计算机专家们的 共识 是，中国自 2021 年以来至少有两台被称为“海洋之光”和“天河三号”的超大规模机器在运行，并且正在由曙光研发的第三台超算达到了 2E 级。这些“秘密”超算的数据是通过一些不相关的论文披露出来的。

通用汽车用 3D 打印来解决汽车生产短缺的零件

通用汽车在 2020 年对 3D 打印技术进行了重大投资，建立了 1.5 万平方英尺面积的增材制造中心。雪佛兰的工程师们对一款新的 SUV 的设计做了一个后期改动，需要创造一个额外的零件，以填补了尾部的一个缺口。开发注射成型的模具将花费太多时间，从而延误了 3 万辆汽车的交付。通过 3D 打印，工程师们能够快速设计并使用符合通用汽车标准的柔性材料打印出这些部件。而从设计到完成只用了五个星期。这还不到走注射成型路线所需时间的一半。

                              <span>虽然音乐世界被流媒体服务所主导，但这并没有阻止开发者为桌面电脑创建音乐播放器。

最近，我发现了一个外观漂亮的新的 Linux 桌面音乐播放器。它名为 Amberol，我被它的美丽所震撼。



看起来不错，不是吗？让我们仔细看看它。

Amberol，Linux 上的可爱的音乐播放器

看起来不错是它所做的两件（或几件）事情中的一件。另一件事是播放音乐。

这就是它，Amberol 没有额外的花哨（和有用）的功能，如生成专辑封面、元数据编辑、歌词显示或播放列表和库管理。

这些功能也不像是会在未来的版本中加入。Amberol 只想播放音乐。就是这样。

令人惊叹的用户界面

Amberol 和大多数新的 GNOME 应用一样，是用 Rust 和 GTK 编写的。

它有一个自适应的用户界面，可以根据你正在播放的专辑颜色来改变颜色。渐变效果给了它一个现代、时尚的外观，肯定会成为你的 Linux 美化Ricing截图的一部分。



由于其 UI 没有传统的手柄和菜单，它给应用一个统一的外观。

播放列表

它会从你添加的文件夹中的文件自动生成一个播放列表，显示在左手边的侧边栏。



你可以在左上角看到整个播放列表将播放多长时间的音乐。点击“勾选”符号，你可以选择歌曲，并从播放列表中删除它们。

如果你愿意，可以隐藏播放列表的侧边栏。



音乐播放选项

你可以在界面上看到歌曲的进度。该播放器与键盘上的媒体控制按钮整合得很好。你可以用专用的媒体键来播放、暂停和改变曲目（如果你的系统上有）。

Amberol 为你提供了一些播放音乐的选项。你可以打开随机播放功能，按随机顺序播放音乐。你也可以单曲循环，直到你厌倦它。



底部的汉堡菜单让你可以选择添加文件或文件夹，并显示可用的键盘快捷方式。



你也可以从这里禁用 UI 颜色变化以配合专辑封面。

在 Linux 上安装 Amberol

Amberol 是 以 Flatpak 形式提供的。请确保 你的系统已启用 Flatpak 支持。

要安装 Amberol，请打开终端并使用以下命令：

flatpak install flathub io.bassi.Amberol


安装完毕后，在菜单中搜索该应用，并点击启动。

第一次运行时，它会要求你添加音乐文件或文件夹。你也可以拖放文件播放。



总结

就个人而言，我更喜欢流媒体服务，因为我没有本机音乐珍藏。但我知道有的人有大量的 CD 收藏，现在都保存在硬盘上。

Amberol 是一个外观漂亮的应用，对于播放本机音乐来说，它足够好。最吸引人的是它基于专辑封面的自适应用户界面。

请你试试它，并在评论区分享你的经验。

                              <span>嗨，伙计们，在这篇指南中，我们将演示如何在 Windows 11 的之外配置 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS（Jammy Jellyfish）的双启动设置。

为使其能工作，你需要在你的计算机上已经安装好了 Windows 11 。接下来，你将需要在你的硬盘驱动器上创建一个单独的分区，你将在此分区上安装 Ubuntu 22.04 。我们将包含这点知识，因此不要担心。

前置条件：

在设置双启动前，这些是你所需要的：


一个 Ubuntu 22.04 的可启动 USB 驱动器，你可以转到 Ubuntu 22.04 下载页面 来下载 Ubuntu 22.04 的 ISO 镜像文件。在 ISO 镜像文件到位后，拿一个 16GB USB 驱动器，并使用 Rufus 应用程序来使其可启动。

快速稳定的互联网连接


步骤 1、在你的硬盘驱动器上创建一个可用的分区

正如介绍中所提到的，我们首先需要在硬盘驱动器上创建一个单独的分区，我们将在其中安装 Ubuntu 22.04 。

因此，通过按下 Windows + R 组合键来打开磁盘管理器实用程序。

在对话框中，输入 diskmgmt.msc ，并按下回车键。



磁盘管理disk management控制台将显示当前磁盘分区，如你将在下面所看到的一样。我们将通过压缩 “卷 E” 来创建一个用于安装 Ubuntu 的分区。这在你的安装过程中可能有所不同，但是只需要跟着做，你就会理解其中的大体意思。



因此，在你想要压缩的磁盘驱动器卷上点击鼠标右键，并在弹出的菜单中选择 压缩卷Shrink 选项。



将会出现一个弹出对话框，如下所示。具体指定压缩的控件大小（以 MB 为单位），并单击 压缩卷Shrink 。

这是指定给 Ubuntu 22.04 安装所用的空间。

                              <span>当我们的生活和工作压力越来越大，很多风险提前爆发的可能性也就越来越高。一些人到中年才容易发生的健康问题，逐渐下移到年轻一代已经屡见不鲜。作为一名26岁的伪“年轻人”，我已经不幸被“突发性耳聋”这个不速之客造访过。也正是因为这次经历，才让我开始明白，耳朵和听力问题，并不是老年人的“专利”，这个风险其实悄然潜伏在我们每个人的身边。
所以我有必要提醒你：别大意，照顾好你的耳朵。
（本人不是医生，也不是医学生，这些经验和认识均来自于治疗经验和与医生的交流，如有不准还请指出，定会积极改正）
什么是突发性耳聋
突发性耳聋是一种是指突然发生的、原因不明的感音神经性听力损失或下降。你可能很少，但它也是一种耳鼻喉科的常见病。一直以来，这种疾病多见于40-60岁的中老年群体，且男女发病率并没有显著的统计学差异，但近些年来，这种疾病的发病年龄已经明显有了下移的趋势。童年的记忆歌手吴克群就曾经在自己的微博上透露，自己曾被这种疾病所困扰。
突然性耳聋最大的特点，就是“突然”，往往在你感觉到有不适时，就意味着必须要马上就医了。并且，虽然学名为突发性耳聋的，但这种疾病十分狡猾，耳聋并不是唯一一种症状，甚至在病程初期，并不一定会“聋”，所以全面了解所有可能出现的症状是对它防患于未然的第一步。
有哪些典型症状
耳部的感官不适
耳部的感官不适，是指被患者察觉到的耳内不适感。这种不适感以耳闷、耳涨以及耳道的紧绷感最为典型。一般来说，初次发病的患者以耳部不适感居多，听力下降的表现并不明显。初次发病的患者，往往会感到耳朵内部像堵了棉花一样闷涨感，或者感觉到耳道内部有一种说不出的紧绷感，好像漩涡一样向里卷。
耳部的感官不适可能是很多人最早察觉到的异样，以我为例，第一次出现的症状是带上耳机时，感到耳朵内部有异物向外扩张，位置非常深，不带耳机的话感觉像是鼓膜向外鼓出。如果你出现了以上这些类似的症状，尤其可以确定不外耳道或…</span>

现在在一线互联网公司，因为公司发展受阻，所以最近有换工作的想法，手里几个 offer 目前就觉得 Zoom 还行，遂有此贴，不是求职单纯是为了咨询，所以没有发在「酷工作」。
先来说一下个人情况:
2021 年校招 ssp ，无股票
带一条业务线的单独业务分支，但是业务因为政策问题迟迟无法上线
后半年有机会晋升，但是可能性不大，因为后半年窗口比较小
字节一个月前三面挂过，现在被捞起来流程中，还没面完，走完估计两周
再来说下 Zoom 的情况:
Zoom 给了一个平的总包
没有一个明确的级别体系和晋升规则
薪资有 1/3 股票构成，月 base 比目前低 10+
我不太清楚美股变现规则，手续费和税之类不是很懂
我的顾虑:
返回互联网会不会被卡级别、卡涨幅？
在 Zoom 会不会成长停滞
Zoom 在后疫情时代会不会发展受阻？

各位大佬，有没有公司可以使用的知识管理的 Wiki 系统推荐？就是想把一些笔记、材料、培训文件统一管理起来。要求如下：
本地存储、或者可以自己搭建服务器部署
支持多人合作
支持检索
支持文件与笔记的链接、笔记与笔记的链接（有点类似于双链笔记？）
先谢谢各位大佬了</span>

我准备把家里的 yoga 电脑换掉，在纠结是 MBP 2021 还是 M2 的 air ，按照 16+512 算，其实两者的价格已经很接近了（ MBP 按多多价算），续航方面虽然 air 强很多，但 pro 也够用，重量 air 完胜，pro 太重了。主要纠结点就是高刷屏。
我自己工作，之前用的是 MBP 2019 ，现在用的是 MBP 2021 ，我个人对高刷屏好像没有感受出太大区别。
大家的建议呢？</span>

因为最新的 MIUI 测试版 /其它部分 UI 会始终显示 NFC 图标，所以写一下这个图标如何隐藏。
准备工作：
USB 数据线
电脑端 adb
手机打开 USB 调试，部分设备需要打开USB 调试（安全模式） 一般会在 USB 调试开关的下方
操作步骤：
adb shell settings put secure icon_blacklist nfc

nfc 可以替换成下面的内容，多个的话可以用,分割。

图标描述




volume
静音 /震动图标


location
定位图标


speakerphone
麦克风使用中图标


wifi

如果需要恢复，需要使用：
adb shell settings put secure icon_blacklist null

苹果现在自研芯片打通了自家产品线后，刀法也越来越准了，看起来需求明确的话，选择产品会很容易，实际情况是不是这样？
iPhone 产品线
需要高刷，高性能，高拍照需求的选 Pro ，但需要忍受更大的手机重量
iPad Pro 产品线
同样需要高刷，高存储容量，高显示（ 12.9 mini LED ）的用户，可以选 Pro 系列，但价格很贵，基本可以摸到 MacBook Pro 14/16 这个产品线
MacBook 产品线
高性能用户选择 MacBook Pro ，代价就是重量更重，价格也贵很多
MacBook Air 系列，现在更轻，显示更好，也更薄，定位很好，希望可以有个 12 寸或者更大的版本出来
今年的 13 寸 MacBook Pro 感觉是个清库存的货色。。不太建议买
iMac 产品线
目前只有 24.5 寸的版本，希望可以扩展 27 甚至 32 版本的普通版
然后 iMac Pro 系列可以出高刷和 mini LED 版本的
Mac mini 和 Studio 系列
目前 Studio 对于普通用户来说有点过于强大
希望 M2 版本的 mac mini 可以缩小体积，并且增加 SD 卡槽
其他的就不多展开了，苹果自家的显示器回归，特别是“平民款”的产品，是一个好事情。
我觉得苹果策略是让普通用户或者专业用户从买一个凑合应对所有场景，到各个场景可以选择不同产品，达到卖更多和圈钱更多的目的。</span>

                              <span>bwt: 坐标北京, 最近租了一间公寓: 一层向北(迫于省钱), 住了一晚上, 感觉潮湿的问题比较明显(床单&amp;被子发潮, 身上黏糊糊的, 难受的睡不着). 遂买了个湿度计, 数值在 65-80 之间.
以前也合租过小区一层北面的房子, 但从没像这次 有明显体感上的潮湿.
想知道湿气的来源, 便于以后租房避坑. 列举了几条可能性, 但不太确定😂, 有点迷茫, 遂来问问大伙.
猜想 1 - 屋外空气潮湿?
应该不是. 曾经关着门窗睡觉(非雨天), 但潮湿问题依然存在; 以前租住的房子也没有类似问题.
猜想 2 - 地板?墙壁?
我觉得这个可能性大一点. 虽然地板&amp;墙壁看不出水渍.
目前有换房子想法, 不过 6-7 月是租房的旺季, 同时考虑上班交通, 价格等因素, 一房难寻. 
远水解不了近渴, 针对这个情况, 我尝试入手了个除湿机, 开一晚上可以抽出近 1L 的水😓... 空气明显干燥些, 看起来有用, 但是必须要常开, 一天不除湿, 第二天湿度就恢复原样...
针对以上, 想问下大伙:
* 关于潮湿, 我猜想的原因对不对? 有办法验证吗😂
* 如果要换房子, 房间朝向 &amp; 层数哪个条件对潮湿情况影响大一点?</span>

21 届双非，目前在某传统行业项目外包，入职后前后端不分离写 jQuery 适配 IE8 。后面“有幸”参与了小半年 vue 项目。（一直写 jsp ，jQuery 怕是要废）但不久前被安排做报表，每天改 sql 配报表（个人很排斥，只想写前端，对 sql/后端没兴趣）。现在 6k 二线城市 HF 。
公司安排很乱是前后端不分离的，会让后端写 vue ，到处打杂。同期校招生跑路一大半。目前这个项目收尾后大概率会调往其他项目打杂或者继续使上古神器 jQuery ，jsp 。
有些疑问：
现在行情真的很差吗，找个 8-10k 的纯前端难吗？
这种打杂（都不能叫全干）虽然能混工作经验，但感觉对发展很不利
裸辞的话有存些钱能维持一段时间，但怕焦虑拖下去心态会崩</span>

现在使用命令查看 timedatectl

平时蓝牙鼠标 + 蓝牙键盘，用干电池有点熬不住，虽然单节买着便宜，但是也太不耐用了，所以还是觉得买充电电池。
5 号镍氢标到了3800mAh，卖得还巨便宜，有点不敢下手；甚至还有在玩文字游戏的，18650 的电池标12800mWh，欺负俺没文化呢！  
在这里搜了一下，貌似充电电池的讨论贴不多，并且也比较久远了，所以想问问，现在有什么推荐的充电电池么？</span>

M2 air 不考虑了，升级太小，售价还提高了。

另一个方案是换丐版 macbook pro 14 ，感觉为了大一点的硬盘多花 7000 有点不值。😂

如果不换电脑，就准备买个移动硬盘，把一些能够移动的放到移动硬盘里面，这个方案可行吗？</span>

调查一下有多少人在用 Apple Fitness+ 锻炼？
过去两年一直都是健身环比较多，Apple Fitness+ 只上放松整理课程，隔离的两个月开始每天 Apple Fitness+ 上跳舞和核心的课程，发现质量意外的好，画面精良，对器材要求也很简单，目前我只用哑铃和瑜伽垫，对于只需要保持健康状态而非练大块肌肉足够了。
健身环过去两年已经压扁一个了（每周 4 次，时间 30-60 分钟），第二个也快了，强度已经 30 封顶了，打算换第三个环的时候，更多的转向 Apple Fitness+ ，开始上力量课程。不去健身房感觉每次至少省一个小时，可以风雨无阻。</span>

请教下 git rebase 的操作
当前状态：
本地 feature 开发，做了多次本地 commit 后，在同步到远程前，先做了 fetch ，获取 master 最新的远程代码，然后本地 rebase 操作，未 push 。
碰到的问题：
远程的代码有问题做了回退，这时候本地怎么处理比较好？
我尝试了几个方案，都有些复杂。
把自己 rebase 的代码 reset ，本地 stash 保存，然后操作 master 代码回退后，再次 rebase 。这样比较麻烦，有没有更简单的操作？
场景说明：
master  C1 -&gt; C2 -&gt; C3... Cn

快点收藏起来吧～

Spider-Man: No Way Home is making its way back to theaters on September 2nd after it broke box office records and became one of the highest-grossing films. This time around, Marvel is sprinkling in some new and extended scenes to keep things fresh.
Marvel calls the revamped film “The More Fun Stuff Version,” and says it’s releasing it in celebration of Spider-Man’s 60th anniversary in comics. Oh yeah, and it’s the 20th anniversary of Toby Maguire’s debut in the very first Spider-Man movie (feel old yet?).

We got a look at what the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 could look like in a set of unofficial renders last month, but now we have leaked images of what appears to be the physical device shared by YouTuber TechTalkTV (via 9to5Google). The images match up with the earlier renders and give us a closer look at the device’s display crease, which looks almost nonexistent.
One image shows the device’s display when it’s flipped open, and you can see a slight glare where the crease would typically appear. It looks hardly noticeable, but then again, it is a bit difficult to tell what the crease will look like when viewed from just one angle.


You can pretty clearly see the Galaxy Z Flip 3’s crease when you tilt the phone the right way. As The Verge’s...

ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, is getting serious about entering the virtual reality (VR) space, according to a report from Protocol. A source close to the situation told the outlet that the company plans on investing “tons of money” to develop VR-related content.
It looks like a large portion of ByteDance’s investment is going into hiring. As noted by Protocol, over 40 job listings have popped up for Pico, the Chinese VR headset maker ByteDance acquired last year. Most openings are for Pico Studios’ west coast-based branches in California and Washington, ranging from a head of VR game strategy to a game operation manager. Other open positions suggest an increased focus on Pico’s VR hardware, including an optical engineer and a...

Welcome to the weekend! We’re kicking things off today with a rare deal on the superb Sonos Roam, which remains one of the best Bluetooth speakers we’ve ever tested. Regularly $179.99, you can currently buy it from Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo, and Sonos for just $143.20, the speaker’s best price to date. That’s less than the typical cost of the cheaper Sonos Roam SL, which is essentially the same speaker but without the built-in microphone.
The pint-sized, portable speaker sounds great and comes equipped with a number of useful features, including support for Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple’s AirPlay 2. The Sonos speaker also integrates with the rest of the company’s ecosystem and comes with an IP67 dust and water resistance rating,...

Telegram will soon start putting some features behind a paywall (via TechCrunch). In a post on the platform, founder Pavel Durov announced that the messaging service is launching a paid Telegram Premium subscription later this month, giving users “additional features, speed and resources.”
Durov hints at some of the features coming with the subscription, including early access to new features, the ability to upload larger files, and Premium-only stickers and reactions (which were recently previewed in a beta version of the app). 
But Durov also makes it clear that Telegram’s existing features will stay free, and that the paid features won’t affect the experience for free users on the app. Non-subscribers will still get to look at the...

Earlier this year, keyboard specialist Drop announced its new lineup of DCX keycaps. But rather than focusing on making flashy, colorful designs like most aftermarket keycaps, the first three sets to use the new DCX profile are relatively understated, with simple black-and-white designs or a small selection of primary colors. 
That’s because the focus here is on getting the tiniest details right in the hopes that Drop’s sets might be able to compete directly with GMK’s — a German manufacturer commonly seen as the producer of some of the best-quality keycaps around.

Apple announced on Friday that it’s once again updated its rules about how Dutch dating apps can use third-party payment systems, after the company had “productive conversations with the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM).” The updated rules give developers more flexibility about which payment systems they use, change the language users see when they go to pay, and remove other restrictions that the previous rules put in place.
While the rules aren’t wide-reaching (again, they only apply to Dutch dating apps), they do show what Apple’s willing to do to comply with government regulation — which it could be facing a lot more of as the EU and US gear up to fight tech monopolies, and potentially even force the company to d...

With CES 2022 having wrapped earlier this year, the future looks bright for those who are looking to nab a great TV at a substantial discount. Many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models during the event, ranging from The Frame and LG’s new C2 lineup to Sony’s forthcoming QD-OLED models.

前言
在聊天类应用中，通常用气泡作为聊天内容的背景色，比如微信的聊天背景，别人发过来的是白色的气泡，自己发的是绿色的气泡。

上面这种是比较普通的，这篇我们玩点有趣的，让聊天气泡是渐变色的。可能很多人会觉得渐变很简单，给 Container 来个decoration或者使用 DecoratedBox，使用渐变填充色就可以了，比如下面这种效果：

这个感觉也太丑了😂😂😂，本篇我们来一个高级的 —— 整个聊天窗口的气泡颜色是渐变的，而且随着滚动还会变化！先看看实现的效果，这里有两个效果：
整个窗口的聊天气泡背景色是连续渐变的，而不是每个气泡重复的渐变。
滚动的时候，气泡的背景色会随着滚动的位置变化。

代码实现
使用 Container 的 decoration 或 DecoratedBox 只能在渲染之前就确定好背景色，因此没法在绘制过程中动态改变气泡的背景色，要动态改变气泡背景色就需要自己绘制背景，那就需要使用到 CustomPaint。
首先，我们来看如何绘制渐变背景色。画笔 Paint 对象有个shader 属性，可以配置绘制时的填充行为。来源可以是渐变填充的 Gradient 对象，或是图片的 Image 对象。比如我们要用线性渐变填充，那就可以使用下面的代码实现：
final paint &#x3D; Paint()
  ..shader &#x3D; LinearGradient(
    begin: Alignment.topCenter,
    end: Alignment.bottomCenter,
    colors: colors
  ).createShader(rect);

Android中多个弹窗的排队展示
在实际的开发中，我们会遇到多个弹窗的问题，又不能一次全部弹出，所以我们的代码就是 if else if else 循环嵌套。
例如我们在工作详情中申请一个工作，首先我们就要走一个校验接口，然后接口会告诉需要判断的对象。如下判断逻辑：
首先需要先判断是否是新用户，如果是新用户需要去参加线上培训（跳转页面）
判断用户是否完善了个人信息，如果没有需要去完善个人信息 （跳转页面）
判断个人用工状态是否是Approve，如果个人状态不对需要联系管理员 （拨打电话）
判断当前用户是否填写了每日新冠报告，如果没有需要填写新冠表单（跳转浏览器）
判断当前申请的工作是否需要押金，如果要押金弹框提示（弹框）
如果需要押金，你的钱包又恰好有钱，会提示是否把钱包的钱充值到押金（弹框）
如果改工作需要人脸信息，需要你采集人脸 （跳转页面）
如果是非直营的工作，会提示你非自营工作 （弹窗）
如果该工作需要what&#x27;s app 会弹窗提示你输入账号 （弹框）
如果该工作是银行卡结算，你又没有银行卡信息，需要填写银行卡（新页面）
...
真实业务肯定不止10个条件了，这里就先写10个吧。来，键盘给你，你来写if else 。你写完了？ 中间第5个后面再加一个判断 如果你没有填写技能 去新页面填写你的技能！ 这么多if else 中你真的改的动吗？
什么？你业务中就是这么写的？你改的动？

背景
对于一个普通的android应用来说，so库的占比通常都是巨高不下的，因为我们无可避免的在开发中遇到各种各样需要用到native的需求，所以so库的动态化可以减少极大的包体积，自从2020腾讯的bugly团队发部关于动态化so的相关文章后，已经过去两年了，相关文章，经过两年的考验，实际上so动态加载也是非常成熟的一项技术了，但是很遗憾，许多公司都还没有这方面的涉略又或者说不知道从哪里开始进行，因为so动态其实涉及到下载，so版本管理，动态加载实现等多方面，我们不妨抛开这些额外的东西，从最本质的so动态加载出发吧！这里是本次的例子，我把它命名为sillyboy，欢迎pr还有后续点赞呀！
so动态加载介绍
动态加载，其实就是把我们的so库在打包成apk的时候剔除，在合适的时候通过网络包下载的方式，通过一些手段，在运行的时候进行分离加载的过程。这里涉及到下载器，还有下载后的版本管理等等确保一个so库被正确的加载等过程，在这里，我们不讨论这些辅助的流程，我们看下怎么实现一个最简单的加载流程。

从一个例子出发
我们构建一个native工程，然后在里面编入如下内容，下面是cmake
# For more information about using CMake with Android Studio, read the
# documentation: https://d.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code.html

# Sets the minimum version of CMake required to build the native library.

                              <span>Linux 发现一个“几乎不能被检测到”的寄生木马

安全研究人员发现了一款名为 “Symbiote”（共生体）的恶意软件。他们称其“几乎不可能被检测到”。它会“寄生感染”系统，感染所有正在运行的进程，并为提供 Rootkit 功能、远程访问等。它最早在 2021 年 11 月被发现，似乎是针对金融部门特别开发的。它不是一个以感染机器的独立可执行文件的形式运行的，而是以一个共享对象库的形式加载到所有正在运行的进程中，并寄生感染机器。它采用了多种规避检测的手段，来隐藏文件、进程和网络流量，甚至能让 BPF 工具也无法发现其网络流量。


消息来源：黑莓



老王点评：其实通过共享对象库寄生的木马并不稀奇，只是这个木马做了更多的隐藏手段，可见现在针对 Linux 的木马也越来越强大隐蔽了。




Ubuntu 正在改进对低成本 RISC-V 主板 VisionFive 的支持

最近 Ubuntu 开发人员一直在努力提高和改善对赛昉科技的 VisionFive 单板机的支持，有望在 Ubuntu 22.10 中看到对这种低于 180 美元的 RISC-V 计算机的良好支持。VisionFive 是为数不多的不超过 200 美元的、能运行完整 Linux 发行版的 RISC-V 主板之一。自 Linux 5.17 内核开始，就对 VisionFive v1 板提供了主线支持。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：目前这个板子还是比较缺货的，希望能在 Ubuntu 等发行版提供更好的支持时能解决供货问题。有对在这个板子上运行 Ubuntu 感兴趣的同学吗？




推特联合创始人宣布 Web3 的竞争对手：Web5

推特联合创始人 Jack Dorsey 认为 Web3 变得和之前的 Web2 一样有问题，对未来抗审查、注重隐私的互联网来说还只是个梦想。现在，他旗下的区块链公司 TBD 创造了一个新名词 Web5，将通过放弃以区块链为中心的方法来实现无审查、以身份为中心的网络体验，从而击败现有的模式。他们所宣称的技术可能和 BT、Tor 类似。目前这个所谓的 Web5 仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。


消息来源：Coindesk



老王点评：生造名词的技术“创新”，并没有什么意义，就像十多年前 Web2 刚刚初露头角时就有人宣称 Web3，但是到现在连 Web3 也并没有真正得到共识和认可。更别说所谓的 Web5，我就想知道，Web4 怎么了，是 4 不吉利么。此外，其视为典范的，无论是 BT 还是 Tor，都太过于激进了。</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-14697-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>你好，技术兄弟，最近红帽发布了最新的操作系统 RHEL 9，RHEL 9 满足了混合云的所有要求。它可以安装在物理服务器、虚拟机和容器镜像中。

当我们没有订阅的时候，想安装软件包来做实验，那么设置本地的 Yum 或 DNF 仓库将是很方便的。

在本指南中，我们将介绍如何在 RHEL 9 上使用 DVD 或 ISO 文件一步一步地创建本地 Yum/DNF 资源库。

创建本地 Yum/DNF 资源库的先决条件:


最小化安装 RHEL 9 系统

具有管理权限的 sudo 用户

RHEL 9 DVD 或 ISO 文件


1）挂载 RHEL 9 ISO 文件或 DVD

我们假设 RHEL 9 iso 文件已经被复制到系统中。运行下面的挂载命令，将 ISO 文件挂载到 /opt/repo 文件夹。

$ sudo mkdir /var/repo
$ sudo mount -o loop rhel-baseos-9.0-x86_64-dvd.iso /var/repo/




如果是 DVD 光盘，运行：

$ sudo mount /dev/sr0 /var/repo/


2）在 /etc/yum.repos.d/ 目录中创建仓库文件

在 /etc/yum.repos.d/ 目录下创建一个名为 “rhel9-local.repo&#x60; 的仓库文件，内容如下：

$ sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel9-local.repo
[Local-BaseOS]
name&#x3D;Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 - BaseOS
metadata_expire&#x3D;-1
gpgcheck&#x3D;1
enabled&#x3D;1
baseurl&#x3D;file:///var/repo//BaseOS/
gpgkey&#x3D;file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

[Local-AppStream]
name&#x3D;Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 - AppStream
metadata_expire&#x3D;-1
gpgcheck&#x3D;1
enabled&#x3D;1
baseurl&#x3D;file:///var/repo//AppStream/
gpgkey&#x3D;file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release


保存并关闭该文件。



3）刷新 Yum/DNF 和订阅管理器的缓存

执行以下命令来清理 Yum 或 DNF 和订阅管理器的缓存。

$ sudo dnf clean all
$ sudo subscription-manager clean




在上面的输出中，我们得到一个警告信息 This system is not registered with an entitlement（系统没有注册权限）。所以，为了抑制这个警告信息，编辑文件 /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf，将参数 enabled&#x3D;1 改为 enabled&#x3D;0。

$ sudo vi /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf




保存并退出该文件。

4）使用本地仓库安装软件包

现在我们都准备好测试我们的本地仓库了。运行下面的命令来查看配置仓库。

$ sudo dnf repolist


输出：



现在，试试用 dnf 命令通过上面配置的本地仓库安装软件包。

$ sudo dnf install nfs-utils


输出：





完美，上述输出证实了 nfs-utils 包及其依赖项已经通过本地配置的 Yum 或 DNF 仓库成功安装。

这就是本指南的全部内容。我希望你觉得它有参考价值。请在下面的评论区发表你的疑问和反馈。

                              <span>比起无处不在的 Google，有些搜索引擎替代品更加尊重隐私，而 DuckDuckGo 就是其中之一。

最近，这个搜索引擎有了很大的改进，搜索一般网页十分顺畅。在搜索本地地点方面，则还远不及 Google。

不过，DuckDuckGo（简称为 DDG）有一些很酷的功能，大部分用户还没注意到。如果你是一位 DDG 狂热粉，你可能会喜欢用这些小技巧来提升你的搜索体验。

1、跳转到特定网页

在你最喜欢的网站名称前输入 ! 即可直接进入这个网站。则类似于 Google 的 “运气不错” 功能，但用 DDG 的话来说，这就叫 “叹号搜索”。

有一些网站有缩写形式，开始输入时便会提示。



在网站名后面输入搜索词，就可以直接抵达那个网站的搜索结果处。

2、文本转 ASCII

Figlet 是一个 有趣的 Linux 命令，可以将任意文本转换为漂亮的 ASCII 画格式。

在任意搜索词前输入 figlet，就会显示 ASCII 输出。无需打开终端。



3、检查社交媒体的状态

在某个人的 Twitter 名前加上 @，就会显示 TA 的状态（关注者等）。



4、生成强密码

输入 password 并加上需要的字符数，就可以生成一个独特的强密码。



5、生成随机密码短语

输入 random passphrase 可生成一段密码短语，通常长度为 4 个词。



6、获取一份速查表

在需要看速查表的搜索词后面，可输入 cheatsheet。如果要搜索的东西有速查表，就会立即显示在搜索页面。



7、通过色码获取颜色

输入 color 并加上你想查的颜色的十六进制码，便可显示这个颜色。



8、生成随机数

搜索 random number 会输出一个 0 到 1 之间的随机数。

即将到来的 openSUSE 小发布版本终于来了。如果你使用 openSUSE 作为你日常使用的桌面或服务器版本，你现在可能已经测试候选版本好几周了。

openSUSE Leap 15.4 的重点是软件包的更新，用以奋起直追 SUSE Linux Enterprise 的 SP 4 。因此，你将注意到一些弃用的软件包，以及可用于替换它们的新的升级。

当然，你应该有一些可用的软件包来确保兼容性。但是，大多数较旧的版本已经被移除。

openSUSE Leap 15.4: 有什么新的变化？

为与最新的 SUSE Linux Enterprise（SLE）相适应，像 Python 2 和 KDE 4 一样的软件包已经被移除。你可以在这次的发布版本中找到较新的桌面环境。

此外，在容器和 AI/ML 用例方面，更新了 Podman、Containerd、Tensorflow 和 Grafana。

Leap Micro 5.2

Leap Micro 是针对容器和虚拟化工作负载定制的轻量级操作系统的最新版本。它也是 Leap 版的 MicroOS，是 Tumbleweed 的一种变体，提供了自动管理和修补。

桌面环境

Xfce 4.16 继续保留，但你可以找到主要功能的一些新补充，包括新图标和调色板。

Xfce 4.16 中的设置管理器也获得了视觉上的刷新。类似地，文件管理器（Thunar）也有一些改善，新的状态托盘插件的深色模式支持等等。

KDE 4 软件包已经被弃用，Plasma 5.24 LTS 已经作为长期支持版本中包含于其中。

要深入了解这些变化，你可以查看我们之前针对 KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS 的报道。总体来说，新的 KDE Plasma 体验应该会令桌面用户赞叹。

说到 GNOME，你可以发现包含在 openSUSE Leap 15.4 中的 GNOME 41 带来了一系列的改善和新的特色功能。了解更多关于 GNOME 41 的信息，你可以期待它的一些新的特色功能。

对于其它的可用的桌面环境来说，Leap 15.4 包括：


MATE 桌面环境 1.26

Enlightenment 桌面环境0.25.3

深度桌面环境 20.3


弃用的软件包

移除了一些基础的软件包，包括 Python 2（生命终结）、Digikam、TensorFlow 1.x 和 Qt 4 等软件包。

在更新系统后，你可以使用 Qt 5 和 Plasma 5 。

更新的软件包

很多重要的软件包在 Leap 15.4 中得到了更新，包含一些流行的软件包：


TensorFlow 2.6.2

Podman 3.4.4

GNU Health 4.0

sudo 1.9.9

systemd 249.10

AppArmor 3.04

DNF 4.10.0

LibreOffice 7.2.5


因此，你应该会注意到一些针对服务器用户和桌面用户的各种应用程序的有用更新。很多多媒体应用程序，像 VLC、GNOME MPV 等，都得到了升级。

其它改善

随着基本软件的更新和清理，你也可以找到一个由 SUSE 维护的较新的 Linux 内核 5.14.21。

更新后的内核对硬件的支持应该会有改善。

更多信息，你可以参考针对 openSUSE Leap 15.4 的发布版本说明。

It is a very common need in almost all applications to modify the components provided by 3rd party libraries. Those modifications are generally done for:
Changing the styles
Adding a missing feature
And it is very crucial for such libraries to provide ways to achieve those modifications easily.
In the first part of this tutorial we will learn how to modify styles so that our changes do not conflict with future updates of Angular Material library. As a bonus, I will provide a list of thumb rules which you should follow while making any style changes.
In the second part of this tutorial, we will learn all the ways to customize angular material buttons and decide which is better.

Using vulnerable and outdated components with known vulnerabilities has always been in the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks. You can take a giant leap in securing your projects only if you use up-to-date tools and libraries.
If you have the Not invented here (NIH) syndrome, you prefer to develop everything from scratch. That&#x27;s fine if you have the time and money to do so. But building major things like cryptography and web servers from scratch needs a lot of skills and effort. Such complex components cannot be built by a single person. Even if you have made one, you should not use it in production without in-depth reviews from many other people.

Sealed Secrets can works perfectly well with Argo CD. It is one of the very best secret managment approachs that you should consider.
The same idea can apply to both Helm, Kustomize or other GitOps tools.
There is no golden standard about secret management in Argo CD. Instead, Argo CD just provides you a list of solutions here and you have to think it yourself. 
Although I opt-in for Sealed Secrets, I also want to show you why you should use it instead of just telling you to use it.
To answer why, we need to think about two questions.
Although there are many solutions available, basically there are just two ways to store secrets, i.e. store in secret management platforms or git repositories. 
I don&#x27;t prefer to use secret management platforms.
No matter what platform you use, it won…</span>

All the code used in this tutorial can be found on my GitHub project: docker-github-runner-windows.
Welcome to Part 1 of my series: Self Hosted Docker GitHub Runners on Azure.
In part one of this series, we will focus and look at how we can create a windows container image using docker that will essentially be a packaged up image we can use to deploy and run self hosted GitHub runners as containers. We will focus more on the docker image itself and how we can build our image and run our image on a local server or VM running docker for windows and also scaling out multiple instances of our image using docker-compose.
Part two will focus on building a Linux based Ubuntu image and in parts three and four, we will look at how we can utilize Azure to store and run our containers in t…</span>

When working on a project with multiple developers, git and Github is one of the mostly used tools for code collaboration. 
Imagine a situation where you are working on a feature and before you are done, you 5 different commits. But then, your organizational rules says each pull request must have 1 commit. This means you have to find a way to merge all the 5 commits into 1 (squash them) and then push to your branch before making a PR. Making a PR with 1 commit could also help avoid multiple issues when pulling with rebase.

                              <span>There are several benefits of using Semantic HTML:
It brings about structure and clarity in the code.


Well-constructed and clearly interpretable markup helps with Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Search Engines are able to parse and find headings, paragraph texts and key words from a document much more easily if semantic HTML is used. So, semantic HTML increases SEO scores of a HTML document.


Semantically strutured HTML document favors accessiblity of a website using screenreaders. The site can be navigated better with semantic HTML by visually impaired people.


Semantic HTML is developer friendly, as it helps with both writing and reading the code.


It helps avoid writing unnecessary markup that may increase the size of an HTML document.

Type : c f to create files or : c d to create directories. By default, xplr uses touch and, mkdir commands under the hood, but you can configure it to use anything else. Note that you can create multiple files and directories once you are into the &quot;create file/directory&quot; mode. Once done with creating, Press escape to leave that mode. Also, you can provide paths like ./non/existing/path, ../../existing/path and xplr will create them for you.
Alternatively, you can also utilize the xplr shell by typing : !. Once you are inside the shell, just type the commands you want to, like t…</span>

While development, there is a need to get fields from local storage (ex., userId, token, etc). This chrome extension helps create entries that read data from storage and show it in a small window at the bottom left corner of the development window.
Features:
Create an entry by entering a local storage key name, path (if the key’s value is an object) &amp; a label for reference.
Clicking value copies the content to the clipboard.

For number in range(9)


The for loop unlike the while loop can be used to iterate over lists 


Here&#x27;s an example of the same code I wrote with while loop last week wrote with for loop


The for loop can only be used to iterate over a fixed number of times provided I&#x27;m the range()
The while loop cannot be used to iterate over a list 
I generally use the while loop for an  unknown number of times which can be input by the user when the code run over for the  loop

Scroll to top button can be very helpful for websites with lots of content, pages with infinite scrolling, or mobile devices with a small screen that can cause the content scroll to extend.
You can follow along with this tutorial by forking this template.
To create a scroll button, use an anchor tag with href&#x3D;&quot;#&quot; this makes the browser return to the top of the page when clicked, or you can use a custom Id to return to a specific part of the page.

To make the button position fixed relative to the viewport, you need to set position: fixed on the anchor tag. When the element position is fixed, it gets removed from the normal …</span>

                              <span>优派这个名字相信许多人都不会陌生，在显示器出货排名榜中，可是第四名的存在，记得我最初的一台PC电脑所用的就是这三只七彩文鸟。不过这次我们要聊的并不是优派的显示器，而是他家的投影仪产品--优派Q20家用投影仪。
接下来就是我这段时间的体验感受分享，希望对各位有需求的小伙伴有所帮助。

专业配置，让其天生强悍

优派Q20投影仪所提供的物件不算多，除了投影仪主机、电源线和说明书以外，余下的就是遥控器和Type-C线材。其中附赠Type-C线材实属让我有点意外，一般都是送HDMI线缆的比较多。

优派Q20投影仪采用全白外观，尺寸约355mm×244mm×121mm，属于常见的扁平设计，不过外壳的转角部分更圆润。白色的外观对于颜值上来说加成很高，特别是家用投影仪，白色总能让人眼前一亮，放在桌面上都是一件不错的摆件。

镜头方面，优派Q20投影仪使用玻璃镜头，具有透光高和耐磨的优势，不会因过热而产生画面损失的情况，色彩还原也比树脂更优秀。在细节上，镜头处还设有一个防尘罩结构，当吊装时能起到一定的防尘作用。

此次优派Q20投影仪采用的是RGBG LED光源技术，拥有2300 ANSI Lumens亮度和125% Rec 709宽广色域，对比度达到300w：1，10.7亿色彩，高亮度和高精准，注定了其不凡的原彩画质。
相比常规的投影仪，优派Q20投影仪采用了0.65英寸的DMD，这也就导致其光通量更大，可提供更加透亮的画质。即便在近距离观看大画面时，画面的颗粒感也不会明显，保持清晰的画面。

镜头左下角的圆圈是红外线遥控信号接收处，使用遥控器时注意不要遮挡。虽然机身上没有明显的标注，但优派Q20投影仪是原生1080P物理分辨率，也就是1920x1080像素，绝对不是抖出来的。除了更高端的4K画质以外，1080P是属于当下最适合家用的分辨率，能兼容绝大多数的笔记本和主流高清流媒体。

                              <span>因为行业的升级，接下来一段时间，我们会发现原本相对平静的桌面显示器市场，开始了新一波技术竞赛。

01/ 下一代主流是 OLED 还是 Mini LED？
如果说屏幕分辨率、刷新率是上一波桌面显示器升级关注要素，下一波显示器升级变化要点可能就是背光甚至面板类型了，伴随带来的就是肉眼可见的观感提升，而且你会发现桌面显示器跟液晶电视的升级路线越来越同步。
跟液晶电视类似，目前桌面显示器也处在一个自发光屏的过渡阶段，而这个过渡阶段到底是传统背光改进（比如Mini LED）胜出，还是替换面板类型（比如OLED）胜出，谁也说不清楚，毕竟要面对市场这一看不见的手。
也是在这个纠结的过渡阶段，不少OEM大厂选择了两种方案兼顾，比如飞利浦，在今年上半年直接更新了两款桌面主流型号，代表QD-Mini LED的27B1U7903 ，和代表OLED技术的27E1N8900，毕竟目前两种方案有各自的优缺点，也方便大家根据自己的偏好选择。

Mini LED：可以理解为传统LED面板的技术升级款，主要是针对背光做了升级，采用了Mini LED微米级点阵式控光，比传统电视背光可以做到更细致的分区控光，从而改善传统电视背光均匀度不佳等问题；所以Mini LED机型，往往会从传统电视数十级分区控光，一举提升到百级甚至前级分区控开关光，另外Mini LED电视另外一个显著优点，就是寿命较长（等同传统LED）。
OLED电视：OLED可以说屏幕技术上就完全不同于传统LED屏幕，目前最常见的移动设备手机，近几年基本就换为OLED屏幕，特点是每个像素可以自发光，控制亮度，所以整体画面对比度极高，普遍色域色彩对比度较好，但也有明显的缺点，就是寿命，另外最高亮度往往也不如Mini LED机型。
综合，这两种技术对比上一代液晶面板，在控光（黑场）和色域覆盖都会带来明显提升，但目前的技术水平，两种技术路线还没发说谁完全优…</span>

每年都有给自己定个写一个小工具或者软件的小目标，刚好最近有背英语的需求，苹果商店里的背单词软件感觉都好复杂，而且字体好小，咱只要一个简单的单词本，顺便可以利用碎片时间背背英语单词就好了，所以就自己弄了个小工具，随便学 swift 练练手。
工具主要目的是工作的时候把单词放在角落，定时切换，偶尔瞄几眼记一下，起到潜移默化的作用！自己用了 1 个星期左右，感觉还行，就抽空优化了些用户体验功能，加了收藏，手动切换单词，自定义切换时间等，分享出来给有需求的同学用～

第一次写 mac 的软件，有啥不好的点见谅！有问题可以反馈给咱，抽空应该可以再优化下！后续想再加一下音标和读音的功能，不知道有没有好的 API 可以调用。</span>

我的需求说一下：
主路由。
50 个设备左右。
千兆的。
稳定的、性能够用的路由器养老就行。所以像友善这种基本没有官方稳定固件需要折腾各种野路子固件的软路由我就觉得很难受。
其实手里有一个红米 AX6 基本可以满足我的需求，CPU 也蛮不错的，奈何固件实在太离谱了，作主路由连 NAT loopback 都不支持（现在似乎很难找到不支持 NAT loopback 的路由器了），离大谱。
想请教 V 友们，有没有推荐的主路由？华硕 AC86U 做主路由怎么样？</span>

我有一个简单的需求: 腾讯云轻量应用服务器流量查看和提醒.
现在写了个小工具自动记录并通过一些平台 (比如微信, 钉钉) 通知我, 但没有 UI 及交互界面.
如果进一步, 是做 Web 应用还是 iOS 应用?
我是 ServerCat 的用户, 所以倾向 iOS 应用.
(腾讯云当然是有能力做好的, 但出于商业考虑他们应该没有兴趣, 不过有足够 API 提供出来, 用户可以自己做. 可能是用户需求不大, 没发现市面上有相关软件)</span>

前几天偶然发现这个みんなの自動翻訳＠ TexTra®，是日本国立研究開発法人情報通信研究機構（ NICT ）开发的机器翻译工具。
https://mt-auto-minhon-mlt.ucri.jgn-x.jp/
这东西很强大，提供其他免费机器翻译的基本功能外，还提供一个在线的编辑器（在 [ Google 翻译者套件] 下架后，这个可能是为数不多的免费版在线翻译者工具），以及各种 api 。
但是，这是一个政府的项目，用户数据会被收集用于项目改进。不可商用。
它还有一些有趣的功能，比如“日语缩短”，把复杂的日语一键缩短为简单的日语。</span>

前段时间刷过翟东升老师的视频，讲到疫情期间降低压力，发达国家发钱，我们国家其实也有实力这样做，但是选择了发消费券，刚好昨天抢到了京东 的数字人民币消费券，吐槽一下
数字人民币软件
一个银行搞一个钱包，每个银行还支持的不一样，
​比如目前发现只有招行支持京东的数字人民币支付，如果我要确定那个类型数字钱包支持某一个软件（比如天府通、京东），我得把这几个银行钱包都创建一遍才能确定，及其麻烦
数字人民币消费券
我昨天抢到满 5000-600 的券，我真还不知道怎么使用，比如京东这个，首先的是京东自营的商品。即便是我选择了京东自营的实物，付款选数字人民币支付的时候完全看不到减多少钱的券出来 信息描述，付款上仍然是原价格，就离谱
我这里尝试选择了一款 iphone 13 为例试试，结果发现 买 13 原价 5999-600 京东券&#x3D;5399 。  再减 600 成都消费券 4799 不是和 6 月 1 号活动价一样的吗？？？
啊这。。。。

第一次使用 Firestore, 数据都是前端直接对 db 进行读写. 用 firestore 之前, 进入新页面调用相关 API, 后台接收到请求进行验证+数据处理. 而使用 firestore 后, 前端需要直接操作 db 字段, 需要后端做的只有监听, 比如有多个字段关联, 监听到某字段更改后, 需要后端对相关字段进行处理.
所以有一部分逻辑(REST API 后端的逻辑)在这种模式下需要前端来做, 前端的代码架构需要调整, 比如 REST API 的架构, componentDidMount 进行页面数据请求, button 点击进行网络请求. 而 firestore 架构下, 进行网络请求需要换成 db 读写操作. 这会让代码发生变化.
所以在想, 前端有必要写一套类似后端 REST API 的接口吗? 当页面 didMount 或者按钮点击时候, 直接调用前端自己的封装方法. 这些方法里面对 firestore 进行读写, 并且有相应的成功回掉以及错误类型等.
其次, firestore 这种模式叫什么(对标 REST API)? 
其他大厂或者国内有无 Firebase Firestore 这种东西? 
和 gql 对比呢? 
firestore 比较适合什么项目?
优缺点有哪些?
欢迎大家提供建议.</span>

以下是对于平台的看法：
微博现在变成伸冤平台了，时不时看得血压上冒；最重要的是关注了一群画师、美女、厉害的博主，博主也会转发一些种族、社会阶级、性别对立、负能量等
知乎的热搜基本上和微博同步，都是社会民生问题；
B 站虽然有资讯，但是基本上以 up 主个人输出为主，我更希望看的是群体内容输出
同理微信公众号
小红书上虽然有美丽的图片，但是文字评论都是清一色的赞美
qq 空间上面感觉充满了个人生活动态，以及个人情绪方面，转发类内容都是挂人或者认同居多
同理微信朋友圈
今日头条感觉是老年人使用的 app
我的抖音首页基本上是洗菜拖地的，感觉画风严重不符
所以有没有一种平台或者平台过滤器可以过滤不良消息，又可以看到自己想看的消息呢？</span>

1 、在本地使用 trzsz -d ssh x.x.x.x 登录服务器。加 -d 是开启拖文件上传功能，默认是不开启的。
2 、将 trz 和 tsz 放到服务器某个 PATH 目录下，要有可执行权限。执行命令 trz -v 不会报错即可。
项目地址：https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-go ，给个 Star 支持下？
在 Release 中下载的 zip 里就是三个 trzsz、trz、tsz 可执行程序，也可以自己 clone 下来 make 编译。
在 Mac 上的效果如图（也支持 Windows 和 Linux 的）：

踩坑指南（特别是 Windows ）：
1 、trzsz ssh 时记得加上 -d 或 --dragfile，如 trzsz -d ssh x.x.x.x。
2 、记得将 trz 放到远程服务器某个 PATH 目录下，要有可执行权限。
3 、在 Windows 的 cmd 、PowerShell 、Terminal 上，标题不要有“管理员”，即不要“以管理员身份运行”它们，要不然可能拖不了文件。在我的电脑上 Terminal 总是以管理员运行，后来设置一下 UAC 重启电脑就好了。
4 、在 Windows 的 cmd 、PowerShell 中，拖多个文件进去，也只有一个文件生效的（ 鼠标指向那个 ）。
5 、在 Windows 的 Terminal 中，要拖文件到左上角，出现“粘贴文件路径”时再放开鼠标，要不然没用。</span>

better365.cn ，就是 iShot 的开发商，它有什么过往的黑历史或是让人不能接受的地方吗？
最近了解到这家的软件，也看到它们的软件上架了 MAS 。
看到这家是大陆的软件公司，而且印象中在 V2 看过声讨它们家的帖子，有的伙计声称绝对要回避它们家的软件。
一般来说，上架 MAS 的软件我不会有什么顾虑。但是考虑到开发商是大陆备案（指网站）过的企业，而且貌似有很多负面评价，因此特地在这里发个贴问一下。如果有知道它们家黑历史的，请不妨赐教。
当然，如果只是免费突然改收费，或者是订阅制收费高这种我都能接受。毕竟已经准备花钱了。
我不能接受的是马克丁那种背后搞小动作，或者是软件偷偷安装后门，扫描收集个人信息的，那种一票否决。</span>

I wouldn’t be surprised if you have no idea who Duke Nukem even is — that’s how hard the classic video game franchise cratered a decade ago. Today, the character is mostly known as a punchline for video game vaporware jokes, about how Duke Nukem Forever spent 14 years in development hell only to become a huge flop. 
And yet for years now, Duke’s corporate owners have been whispering that a movie is coming, culminating in The Hollywood Reporter’s story today: Legendary Entertainment has tapped Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg to actually produce a feature film.
I don’t quite know how to react! As a gamer who actually quite liked Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem II and Duke Nukem 3D, I absolutely agree that this...

Capcom has launched a demo of Resident Evil Village that’s powered by Google’s Stadia cloud gaming tech, letting people test out the horror game in a browser. In a press release, Google says that the idea is to let people try out the game, no matter what device they own. The game and its demo were already available for Stadia subscribers, but now anyone can try it out for free, provided they have a supported web browser and an internet connection faster than 10 megabits a second. You don’t even need a Google account; you just navigate to the website, enter your birthday (the game’s rated M), and click the play button.
As for how the demo looks... you certainly get what you pay for with the browser version. Here are a few comparison shots...

One perk most wireless carriers offer to pull you to their side is a free streaming video-on-demand subscription, but now AT&amp;T won’t be giving HBO Max to new customers, and hasn’t replaced it with a different service either. The carrier stealthily discontinued its top-tier Unlimited Elite plan for new subscribers this week, and added a new one that doesn’t include HBO Max anymore, as reported by Next TV (via FierceWireless).
The new top plan is called Unlimited Premium, which comes in at the same $85 a month for a single line. Just like with the now-grandfathered Elite plan, Premium subscribers get unlimited talk / text / data, 4K video streaming, and no slowdowns even if they use a lot of data (a promise AT&amp;T introduced for its priciest...

Tesla is asking its shareholders to approve a three-way stock split to help make the company’s shares cheaper for buyers. 
The request is included in a list of provisions Tesla is planning to bring up at its August 4, 2022 shareholder meeting, which it filed Friday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla is framing it as way to “reset” its stock price, which has gone up dramatically in the past few years — 43.5 percent since the company’s last stock split in August 2020. 
“While this value appreciation has led to our employees benefiting enormously through the years, we want to make sure all employees, no matter when they join, have access to the same advantages,” the company states.

With more people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, for instance, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.
That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a...

问题
在做搜索输入框时，用户输入文本之后，用户如果想更改搜索内容那么我们都会有一个手动清空数据的按钮，在清空数据时，在onChanged(text)回调中没有收到回调。
原因
我们先看下问题代码,如果调用_controller.clear();清空数据，那么在onChanged里是接受不到回调的。为什么会出现这种情况，这就需要我们去查看下源码了。
示例代码：
TextEditingController _controller &#x3D; TextEditingController();

TextField(
  cursorColor: Colors.blue,
  controller: _controller,
  autocorrect: true,
  onChanged: (text){
    print(&quot;onChanged:$text&quot;);
  },
  decoration: InputDecoration(
      labelText: &quot;关键字&quot;,
      hintText: &quot;请输入内容&quot;,
      suffixIcon: InkWell(
        child: Icon(Icons.close),
        onTap: (){
          _controller.clear();
        },
      ),
      // icon: Icon(Icons.add),
      hintStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey)),
   ),

我们点进去onChanged的源码进去看下，

                              <span>“Light,” says Chris Wood, “is the purest form of radiance.” The Cambridgeshire-based artist is known for her dazzling installations made of dichroic glass—this transparent material produces a shifting spectrum of color depending on the viewpoint—that emit phenomenal prisms when illuminated. Often arranged on a panel or wall, the works evoke organic patterns, like helices, murmurations, and in the case of Wood’s most recent piece, the spiral of a nautilus shell.
A commission from the beauty brand Clé de Peau Beauté in celebration of its 40th anniversary, this new rainbow-like installation revolves around that milestone. More</span>

                              <span>Canadian artist Winnie Truong recontextualizes the sleek, piecey qualities of human hair in her cut-paper collages. Constructed in layers within rectangular frames, the surreal works utilize the soft texture to depict flowers, vegetation, and strange anthropomorphic figures with elongated fingers and faces obscured by body parts or surroundings. Each piece is rooted in Truong’s drawing practice, and the colored pencil renderings add depth to the mythical compositions.
An extension of her two-dimensional works, these dioramas similarly explore the connection between women and nature. More</span>

                              <span>MongoDB 6.0 带来了加密查询

即将发布的 MongoDB 6.0 中，可查询加密功能提供了查询加密数据的能力，而且整个查询事务都是加密的。这种端到端的客户端加密使用新颖的加密索引数据结构，被搜索的数据在数据库服务器上一直保持加密，包括在内存和 CPU 中。密钥永远不会离开应用程序，该公司认为查询速度和整体应用程序性能都不会受到新功能的影响。拥有大量敏感数据的组织，如银行、医疗机构和政府，会对这一功能感兴趣。

老王点评：加密查询确实是一种非常有用的新功能，尤其是还能够不影响性能。我知道 IBM 也在做相关的研究，但是似乎没有出现在数据库产品中。




Chrome 102 将通过本地机器学习来阻止页面通知提醒

谷歌在博文中承认，“一方面，页面通知有助于提供你关心的网站的更新；另一方面，通知权限提示可能成为一种骚扰。”当谷歌的新 ML 模型认为你不太可能接受某个通知权限提示时，它将抑制这些提示。此外，这些都发生在你的本地机器上，所以你的浏览数据都不会进入谷歌的服务器。


消息来源：TechCrunch



老王点评：难道这些页面通知不是 Chrome 们释放出来的潘多拉吗？




AWS 称将云化大型机工作负载

“大型机现代化计划”是在去年年底 AWS 在会议上公布的，试图帮助企业将其基于大型机的工作负载迁移到云中，并有可能将其转变为现代云原生服务。该计划可以使客户保持现有的应用程序，并以最小的代码改动将其重新平移到 AWS。但有分析师认为，将大型机工作负载迁移到云端的公司，几乎肯定要在未来的某个时候对其进行重构或重新编码，从而背上技术债务。


消息来源：TheRegister



老王点评：这不过是从一个供应商锁定换成另外一个锁定罢了，毕竟大型机之所以还继续存在，有一部分原因是被锁在原有基础设施上无法摆脱。</span>

                              <span>选择一款最中意的文字处理程序把你的想法打印到纸上。




作家们总是在寻找更好的方法将他们的文字和想法以更好的方式呈现给他们的读者。我对文字处理程序最早的印象是在 Apple II 上使用 AppleWorks 和后来的 FrEDWriter，后者是一个创建于 1985 年的免费文字处理程序。这是我的学生们的标配，他们许多人来自没有钱购买专有软件的家庭。

Abiword

在 20 世纪 90 年代时，我开始使用 Linux，寻找我可以使用的高质量的写作程序，并推荐给跟随我进入开源软件世界的学生们。我首先接触的文字处理程序是 AbiWord。AbiWord 来自西班牙语 Abierto，意思是“开放”。它最早发布于 1998 年，并且之后一直在升级。它使用 GPLv2 开源协议。它支持列表、缩进，字符格式等基本功能，支持 .doc、.html、.docx、.odt 等多种格式文件的导入和导出。



Etherpad

Etherpad 是一个开源协作编辑项目。它可以让你像 Google Drive 那样实时编辑文档，主要的区别是它是完全开源的。据它的网站上介绍，你可以“与你的朋友、同学或同事一起写文章、新闻稿、待办事项，同时在同一个文件上工作”。其源代码可随时查看。Etherpad 采用 Apache 2.0 开源协议。你可以直接在线使用它，或者把它下载并 安装 到你的 Linux 电脑上。

Cryptpad

CryptPad 是一个端到端加密的写作套件。使用 GPLv3 开源协议，并且源代码公开在 GitHub 上。它由 Xwiki 实验室开发。可替代 Google Drive，并且是自主托管的。根据其网站描述，“CryptPad 旨在实现协作办公。实时同步文档的更改。由于所有数据都已加密，因此该服务及其管理员无法查看正在编辑和存储的内容。” Cryptpad 为用户提供了 丰富的文档。

Focuswriter

FocusWriter 是一个简单的免干扰的编辑器。它使用隐藏式界面，鼠标移动到屏幕边界时才显示界面。它使用 GPLv3 开源协议，并为 Linux 提供了 Flatpak 软件包，也为 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 提供了 DEB 和 RPM。下图是一个 FocusWriter 桌面的例子。这是一个非常简单直观的界面，菜单自动隐藏，当鼠标指向屏幕顶部或边缘时才会显示。文件默认保存为 .odt 格式，也支持纯文本、.docx 和富文本。



LibreOffice Writer

LibreOffice Writer 是我最喜欢的，我已经使用了十多年了。它拥有我需要的所有特性，包括富文本格式化。它还拥有我见过的最多的导入、导出方式。类似于 APA 这样的问卷和出版模板它拥有十多种。我最喜欢的是它可以将文件导出为 PDF 和 epub。 LibreOffice Writer 是一个自由软件，使用 Mozilla 公开许可证（MPL）2.0 开源协议。其 源代码 由文档基金会提供。LibreOffice 支持大多数 Linux 发行版。同时它也提供 Flatpak、Snap 和 AppImage 软件包。另外，你也可以把它下载并安装到 MacOS 和 Windows 上。



OpenOffice Writer

Apache OpenOffice Writer 是一个全功能的文字处理程序。它可以简单地用于备忘录，也可以复杂到足以编写你的第一本书。依据官网的描述，OpenOffice Writer 将文档自动保存为 .odt。它还支持将文档保存为 .doc、.docx、富文本和其他格式。OpenOffice Writer 使用 Apache 许可证 2.0 开源协议。源代码在 GitHub 上公开。

还有许多自由开源软件等着大家去发现。它们非常适合完成你的日常任务，你也可以为它们的发展做出贡献。你最喜欢的 Linux 文字处理器程序是什么呢？

                              <span>Linus Torvalds 发布了用来测试的 Linux 内核 5.19 RC1，带来了一些重大变化。


继上个月 Linux 内核 5.18 发布之后，Linus Torvalds 宣布了 Linux 内核 5.19 系列第一个候选版本。与此同时，Linux 内核 5.19 官方合并窗口关闭，这意味着除非是关键性的，否则不会再接受任何新功能。

简单看一下 Linux 内核 5.19 的新内容，会发现 CPU、GPU、网络、存储和核心模块都有常规的更新。此外，代码清理、淘汰过时硬件和对以后芯片组的持续支持是此版本的亮点。

在进一步介绍之前，让我们简单来看一下这些新特性。

Linux 内核 5.19（RC1）的新特性

CPU

首先需要提及的是，Linux 内核 5.19 开始 初步支持 龙芯架构的 CPU 系列。龙芯由中国龙芯中科公司设计开发。龙芯架构的 CPU 是兼容 MIPS 架构的通用微处理器。不过虽然现在提供了支持，但是你仍不能在龙芯 CPU 上启动 Linux，因为一些代码还在审核中。希望在 5.20 版本中能够使用。

新的 英特尔 IFS 驱动 在该版本中落地，这有助于在部署前后发现硬件问题。它能够在早期阶段检测电路层面的 CPU 错误。

在前几个针对英特尔 CPU 的内核版本中一直在对电源管理和散热方面进行开发，这个版本 也不例外。首先，为 Raptor 和 Alder Lake 家族添加了英特尔 运行时平均功率限制Run-Time Average Power Limiting（RAPL）的支持。其次，改进了 P-state 驱动以处理频率变化，并且基于 CPU 的缩放支持被添加到被动 devfreq 中。

虽然英特尔 CPU 主要是散热和电源管理方面的工作，但对 AMD CPU 系列来说有更多的性能更新。首先，计划在今年年底完成 ZMD Zen 4 CPU 的 基于指令的采样Instruction-Based Sampling（IBS）模块引入了更多更新。此外，此版本引入了 PerfMonV2，提供了更多性能监视能力。

此外，该版本中移除了 a.out 支持。同样，过时的 Renesas H8/300 CPU 也被移除了。

主要 ARM 更新

终于，主线 Linux 内核能够 支持 ARM 多平台 了。在 Linus 的 RC1 开场白中可以看到，这是该版本中的巨大改变！从 Linux 3.7 开始，跨越了十多年的工作，这是多么漫长的过程。



图形和存储升级

存储子系统在各种流行的文件系统中都有性能提升。最主要的变化包括苹果 M1 NVMe 控制器支持和对 XFS 文件系统的更好支持。此外，Btrfs、F2FS 以及 exFAT 文件系统也有增强。

在代码行数方面，有一个令人兴奋的指标是仅是图形驱动程序 Linux 内核 5.19 就增加了大约50 万行代码。它包括 AMD 的 RDNA、CDNA，英特尔的 Raptor Lake、DG2/Alchemist 等图形驱动更新。

重要的网络变化

鉴于数据传输大幅增长，对 Big TCP 的支持有助于支持数据中心 400 GBit 级别的流量。它还可以在高性能网络环境中降低延迟。

继续改进了 多路径 TCPMulti-Path TCP（MPTCP）。此外，高通 ath11k WiFi 驱动程序在此版本中添加了网络唤醒功能。同样增加了对瑞昱的 8852ce 芯片、联发科的 T700 调制解调器以及瑞萨科技的 RZ/V2M 的支持。

其他值得注意的功能

首先，内核中著名的随机函数生成器（RNG）在此版本中 继续 改进。

其次，著名的新兴的 Framework 模块化笔记本电脑获得了此版本 Chrome OS EC 驱动支持。Framework 笔记本现在可以作为一个非 Chromebook 设备利用 ChromeOS 的嵌入式控制器。

此外，Wacom 绘画板以及其他相关设备也有众多更新。包括 对联想 Thinkpad TrackPoint II、谷歌 Whiskers Touchpad、联想 X12 TrackPoint 等设备支持的提升。

                              <span>去年 9 月，我在荷兰参加了一个中文文化沙龙组织的活动，当时整体分享、讨论的氛围极好。在后半段的提问环节时，有个朋友问了大家一个问题：“生活里我常常被淹没在各种各样的信息里，导致我不断怀疑自己以前做的决定、以及正在做的决定是否是正确的。我应该怎么做，才能坚持自己的选择？或者怎么样才能做出「好的选择」？”
那时我似乎福至心灵，脑海里突然浮现出了我对于这个问题的答案，但是这个答案仿佛只是一个框架、又或者是一幅画，只是处在「心灵语言1」的阶段。但还好借由当时的气氛，我艰难地用语言将答案组织出来了。
当时我没觉得自己的答案多有建设性，但是会议之后至少有两个人过来和我说，我刚才的答案对她们很有帮助。我听后很开心——能够帮助到别人——同时我心里也暗暗记下，这个想法很重要，但还不够成熟、不够逻辑自洽，只是藏在脑海深处的、模糊的一些想法。
但现在，我决定将我脑海里尚且不够清晰，但可以与人分享的内容写下来。而让我产生写下这个想法的契机，是我前段时间读的三本书2，或者说这三本书里提到的想法。这些想法的组合，和我当时在会议上的回答不谋而合。但是借由作者清晰的描述，我似乎也能够将我脑海里的想法描述出来了。我决定借着写这篇文章的机会，希望找到一个答案来回答——我应该怎么与这个世界相处？
问题与答案
「我应该怎么与这个世界相处？」这个问题似乎与文章开头提到的问题不同，但实际上是一个问题。
当我们谈论「与这个世界相处」时，「世界」指的是什么呢？
首先是「别人」，即我们的朋友、家人、爱人、同事、陌生人，乃至我们关注的明星和 influencer。各种各样的人对我们的影响是极大的。父母让我们选择的大学专业、朋友升职的信息、明星代言的品牌、关注的大 V 说的某个观点，这些信息无时无刻不在影响我们对世界的看法。如何与这些人（及背后的信息）相处？
其次是「信息」，关注的新闻、读的书、朋友圈里的信息，这些信息是真是…</span>

Java is a great programming language, but sometimes I want a Java-like language that&#x27;s just a bit more flexible and compact. That&#x27;s when I opt for Groovy.
In a recent article, I reviewed some of the differences between creating and initializing maps in Groovy and doing the same thing in Java. In brief, Groovy has a concise syntax for setting up maps and accessing map entries compared to the effort necessary in Java.
This article will delve into more differences in map handling between Groovy and Java. For that purpose, I will use the sample table of employees used for demoing the JavaScript DataTables library. To follow along, start by making sure you have recent versions o…</span>

这不是一个关于建立一个应用程序的教程。相反，它是一个指南，将帮助您将遇到的任何用户界面实现到您已经拥有的应用程序中。本教程还解释了Flutter中各种各样的UI概念。
什么是Flutter？
Flutter是谷歌的一个开源框架，用于从一个代码库中构建漂亮的、本地编译的、多平台的应用程序。- (来源：Flutter.dev)
在Flutter中，与大多数框架相反，Dart是你用来编码的唯一编程语言。这是Flutter的一个未被充分强调的好处。特别是对于一个可以构建桌面、移动和网络应用的工具。
大多数UI平台使用不止一种语言。例如，在前端Web开发中，你必须写HTML、CSS和JavaScript。对于Android，你必须写Kotlin（或Java）和XML。但在Flutter中，只有一种语言。Dart。
再加上只有一种编程语言的好处，Flutter很简单，因为Flutter中的所有东西都是一个widget。比如说 [AnimatedWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedWidget-class.html), [BottomNavigationBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html), [Container](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html), [Drawer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Drawer-class.html), [ElevatedButton](ht…</span>

                              <span>前言
上一篇文章：揭秘kotlin协程中的CoroutineContext
上一篇文章中介绍了kotlin协程的CoroutineContext的主要组成以及它的结构，kotlin协程的CoroutineContext它是一个K-V数据结构，保存了跟协程相关联的运行上下文例如协程的线程调度策略、异常处理逻辑、日志记录、运行标识、名字等，本篇文章是作为上一篇文章的补充，在使用kotlin协程一年多之后，对kotlin协程的实现有了新的认识，本文会深入介绍kotlin协程的实现原理，例如Continuation和CPS，suspend方法的含义以及背后的原理，协程是如何被创建、启动、调度，同时使用kotlin-stdlib提供的intrinsics原语实现一个简化版的协程，从而帮助我们更好地理解kotlin协程的整个设计思想，kotlin协程的源码被放在了两个库中，一部分是在kotlin标准库kotlin-stdlib中，一部分是在kotlin协程官方实现库kotlinx-coroutines中，其中kotlinx-coroutines是基于kotlin-stdlib的，kotlin-stdlib库提供了实现协程所需的基本原语。
本文涉及到的源码都是基于kotlin1.4版本
Continuation和CPS
在讲解协程的原理之前，我们先来了解一下Continuation和CPS，理解了这两个术语，那么后面对于协程的理解就非常容易了：
Continuation
Continuation延续在计算机中表示程序剩余的部分，它保存了程序从某一点开始的执行状态，并能够在稍后的时间让程序回到这一点恢复执行，所以它是一种能够保存程序执行状态的数据结构，像break、continue这类控制流操作符一样可以暴露给用户使用，用户通过操作Continuation来控制程序的执行顺序，Contin…</span>

                              <span>最近整体过了一下项目的代码，发现一些小细节问题和小瑕疵比较多，这些问题大多具有一定的通性，随手记录一下。如果有人看到这篇文章，希望能对你有帮助。
Jetpack Collection vs Java Collection.
Map, Set等数据结构在项目中非常普遍的使用，很多情况下，这些数据结构需要存储的数据量都不大。
val map &#x3D; mapOf()
val set &#x3D; setOf()

其实Android为这些存储少量的数据的集合做了专门的优化，并且从framework.jar剥离出来，放到Jetpack工具包中。这些优化主要在内存上，能够有效降低内存使用。以Java的HashMap为例，每条记录使用Map.Entry来记录。除了必要的
Node[] table（hash桶）来管理数据，还有Set&gt; entrySet这样的数据来提升易用性。在存储数据量比较少的情况下，这些额外的数据可能会比实际存储的数据占的内存还多。
Jetpack Collection中的ArrayMap和ArraySet等数据结构专门为这些小数据量的情况做了优化，去除了Entry这些辅助的类对象的开销。
现在简单说明一下ArrayMap的实现方式，ArrayMap使用两个数组来存储数据，一个是int[] hash，用来存储Key键的hash值，另外一个是Object[]用来存储Key和Value的值，并且在扩容的时候，表现的非常吝啬，因为ArrayMap扩容行为很便宜，只是数组的Copy，使用的系统函数System::arraycopy，但是HashMap如果要扩容，代价就要大得多。
这里有个点特别说明一下，int[] hash这个数组要保持有序，在有序的前提下，可以使用二分查找。问题是如何在不断新增数据的同时，如何保持有序呢？原来在新增数据的时候，要进行类似于插入排序的操作，所以ArrayMa…</span>

The artist scours shops and trash bins near his Bay Area studio for analog processors in disrepair that he then disassembles, sorts, and reconstructs into metallic sculptures. His previous works include symmetrical assemblages, anatomical recreations, and an ongoing series of birds, the most recent of which are shown here. Mayer builds every piece solely from original parts rather than soldering or gluing, and some sculptures, including the black crow with a Corona-brand typewriter logo on its back, feature spring-like components that allow the creatures to bob their heads.

                              <span>这次我买了一箱五谷道场“非油炸”方便面，写一写非油炸泡面。

在我前几篇关于泡面的文章中，每每写到非油炸泡面，我总是忍不住揶揄几句，作为一个油炸泡面的忠实拥趸，我不喜欢非油炸泡面的原因有很多，比如大部分非油炸面饼无法干吃，只能泡熟再吃；即使泡熟，非油炸泡面在口感上也不及油炸泡面，这是大多数非油炸面饼与生俱来的劣势；最重要的是，非油炸泡面因为面饼的干燥工艺成本高，价格往往更贵。以五谷道场泡面为例，在拼多多上，每盒价格在6.5元左右，而合味道和汤达人泡面的价格每盒不超过5元，统一和康师傅的泡面更是3元不到，油炸泡面显然更具性价比。
非油炸泡面优点是更加健康，与油炸面饼相比，非油炸泡面的干燥工艺不经过油炸，面饼油脂含量更低，但二者差多少呢？我根据泡面的“营养成分表”，特意做了记录。
在非油炸泡面中，以我购买的四包五谷道场泡面汤面为例（拌面因为酱料等原因，脂肪含量高于汤面），他们的脂肪含量分别为：酸笋肥牛面，5.0g/100g；剁椒鱼头面，6.8g/100g；酸汤老鸭面，6.8g/100g；豉汁辣排面，6.8g/100g。以一个简单粗暴的方式取平均值，每百克脂肪含量大概是6.35g/100g。
而油炸泡面的脂肪含量以康师傅和统一经典的几款泡面为例，康师傅红烧牛肉面，25.5g/100g；香辣牛肉面，27.1g/100g；藤椒牛肉面，25.3g/100g。统一香辣牛肉面，22.9g/100g；红烧牛肉面，22.8g/100g；泡椒牛肉面，21.9g/100g。取平均值为24.25g/100g。
每百克非油炸泡面的脂肪含量要比油炸泡面低17.9g，而一包袋装泡面重量刚好在100g左右，因而每包非油炸泡面的脂肪含量要比油炸泡面少17.9g，或者说，油炸泡面的脂肪含量是非油炸泡面的四倍。

@甜食：先锋 Pioneer BD-RW XD07 USB 光驱 

入手渠道：闲鱼
入手价格：285 元

前段时间，我的旧光驱坏了。作为一个较为频繁购买 CD、不那么频繁但一年总会买几次 DVD 或者蓝光影碟的人，我只能马上开始物色一个新的光驱。对于光驱这样的产品，可能每个用户的出发点和使用需求都不太一样，为了让这篇文章对各位读者能更有一些参考价值，我先把我自己的需求，也就是我挑选时的一些选择指标列在这里：

我购买 CD 和影碟的几乎 100% 场景是为了获取内容，也就是「这张盘里的音乐 / 影视我在网上没法找到数字版」。光碟到手之后的第一件事就是把里面的内容妥善地通过抓轨保存到自己的硬盘里，不会直接通过光驱来听音乐或看电影，因此这方面的功能能省则省，可以完全忽略；
因为抓轨的过程并不长，也不需要我在旁边盯着，所以光驱的速度和噪音等因素对我来说并不重要；
因为「获取内容」是主要目的，所以我希望光驱有足够的兼容性，上至蓝光下至 VCD，我也许一年也不会买一次，但当我真的需要买的时候，我希望这台光驱可以派上用场，所以兼容性是第一位的。

其实我买上一台光驱的时候，需求和上面所写的并无太大区别。对于 CD 和 DVD，可以说今天市面上只要是能转的光驱都可以支持，最后影响决策的重点就落在了蓝光的兼容性上：作为比较新的光盘介质，一旦把蓝光加入到需要兼容的格式中，淘宝上五花八门的光驱选择面一下子就变少了许多。
目前，网上可以买到的支持蓝光的外接光驱大致有两种。第一种是「正规大厂」所生产的款式，例…</span>

Wallet 作为 iOS 自带应用，在很多人的 iPhone 上使用频率并不算高，除了交通卡和偶尔刷银联卡进行支付，在大陆地区它的作用实在是非常有限。
但很多人可能不知道的是，Wallet 的功能可能远比微信卡包强大。理想状态下，它甚至可以将家门钥匙、门禁、会员卡甚至身份证都统统塞入 iPhone 或手腕上的 Apple Watch 里，而且只要电源键「滴答」两下就可以优雅地出示。
如果你想为钱包应用添加更多 Wallet 票卡，这篇文章将介绍使用 Pass2U 和 MakePass 制作最简单的静态码会员卡、登机牌等票卡的操作方法，让你在收银台的时候不用手忙脚乱地寻找会员小程序或者 App。
Pass2U
Pass2U 是一家台湾地区的公司做出的软件服务，它主营业务是面向小微商家、企业制作、发放会员卡、集点卡等会员管理服务。在有着完整 Google 服务的国家和地区，Pass2U 可以在 iOS、Android 上无需下载额外软件即可无感分发会员卡。Pass2U 也在 App Store 提供了面向个人用户的 Wallet 票卡制作 App，免费版可以使用其中有限的功能，在港区商店花费 15 港元即可解锁专业版。
在此部分内我会分别介绍 App 内制作与网页端制作的一些范例，以及我觉得各位在制作时需要注意的点。
 
在移动端 Pass2U 的主界面点击右下角的加号按钮，即可开始创建 Wallet 票卡。Pass2U 支持扫描、输入或提取现有票卡照片中的条码来快速套用样式，除此之外，如果选择「套用票卡样式」，则能在内置的…</span>

                              <span>这是一张我一直珍藏在手机里的照片，2017 年，少数派很荣幸的被邀请到美国现场参见 WWDC 大会，并参与了 Apple 设计奖的颁奖和报道，作为一个名不见经传的小媒体来说确实难得，也算是对我们前五年坚持推荐优质付费应用的一个小小认可。

从这一年开始，一张图看懂 WWDC 就成了我们的招牌菜，用最简洁、最漂亮的设计，诠释大会关键信息，别小看这一张图，都是在半夜三点到六点之间做完的，通常都要两三个同事一起熬通宵，我虽然不参与设计，也会尽量陪着，做一些社交传播工作。
也就是这一次，我才了解到苹果设计奖的一些标准关键词：Usability（易用性）、Design（设计）、Innovation （创新），Technology（技术应用）。而我们在 2014 年，就基于用户的角度，总结了少数派报道和推荐产品的四个标准关键词：「原创，优美，实用，有趣」，并把它们标注在网站的页脚。

我没想到两个标准会有这么高的重合度，虽然看起来非常的巧合，但实际上，这是平台方希望保持「用户角度」的相同初心。这几个字说起来简单，但面对商业世界就非常的不容易。因为要坚持这样的推荐报道原则，我们放弃了很多广告投放的机会，商业化进展缓慢，终于在用完第一笔投资之后，进入严重的经营困难，不得不大幅收缩团队，转型拓展。而这个痛苦阶段，就在我们第一次受邀参加 WWDC 大会的一个月之后。
现实就是如此，台前的辉煌不一定被看到，但幕后的痛苦你一个也躲不掉。

从 2017 到 2019 年，少数派连续三次被邀请到美国现场报道 WWDC，随着经验丰富，我们也做了更多的准备。2019 年现场采访了很多开发者，录制了一些现场视频，那一年，我们刚刚建立视频内容小组，开始拓展一些新的形式。虽然拍摄和剪辑比较稚嫩，但内容还算是干货满满。
随后两年，疫情来了，WWDC 也都改成了线上录播，虽然缺少了线下的仪式感，但我们还是保持着熬夜报道和制作一图流的习惯。对于我这个四十出头的中年人来说，熬一次夜还是挺伤身的，但这既是工作，也是爱好，痛并快乐着。
近两年，随着智能手机销量的下降，国产品牌的追赶，WWDC 的关注度似乎也在减退，因为用户希望看到更多惊喜，而现实是硬件和应用创新都进入了瓶颈期。这次 WWDC 2022，苹果生态的价值开始被展现出来，四个大的 OS 都基本完善了，开始进行相互打通，比如 iPhone 和 Mac 电脑的相机协同，比如 macOS 的台前调度被整合到 iPadOS，还有深度调用车机信息的全新 CarPlay，这里不是简单的把设备捏在一块，而是基于用户的场景需求，提供最佳的组合方案，多年构建的生态壁垒又一次拉开了苹果与其他对手的距离。
但回想一下，苹果这个生态是怎么来的呢？首先你不能跟风，而是要站在用户的角度，去做未来的布局；其次你不能贪婪，要放弃短期利益，去构建长期的用户信任；最后你不能偷懒，要保证每一个产品和服务的体验，不断累加产品力。除了这些基础的工作，还要应对开发者关系、投资者收益、供应链管理等一系列的考验，所以具有壁垒的生态不是喊出来的，是一步一步做出来的。

一转眼，五年又过去了，很庆幸少数派还在，并且建立了基础的商业闭环，而苹果已经成为了全球最具价值的公司，我们也又一次参与了 WWDC 和苹果设计奖的采访报道。这五年里，很多外部事物都变了，但更多底层的东西并没有变。</span>

                              <span>GitHub 正式宣布终止 Atom 项目

GitHub 是在 2011 年宣布 Atom，2015 年 5 月发布了 1.0 版本，并吸引了数百万开发者使用。而微软在 2015 年推出的 VS Code 也是受到了 Atom 的启发。在 2018 年微软收购 GitHub 后，Atom 成为了微软的项目。在社区对 Atom 前景的担忧之下，GitHub 承诺不会放弃 Atom。但过去几年 Atom 除了安全更新外几乎没有什么改进。而 Atom 和 VS Code 的用户数此消彼长，Stack Overflow 的 2021 年度开发者调查结果表明，仅 13% 开发者将 Atom 当做主力开发环境，而 VS Code 却高达 71%。最后，Atom 还留下了一个重要遗产，它所分拆出来的 Electron 框架被数以千计的应用广泛使用，其中包括 VS Code、Slack 和 GitHub Desktop 等等。

老王点评：其实可以想到，当年社区对 GitHub 被收购的担忧并非无的放矢。可惜了 Atom，至今我还对 Atom 1.0 那时候的那个 宣传视频 记忆尤深。








IETF 正式颁布 HTTP/3 推荐标准 RFC 9114

作为超文本传输协议的第三个大版本，它确定了 QUIC 包含的 HTTP/2 功能，并描述了如何将 HTTP/2 扩展迁移至 HTTP/3。QUIC 全称为“快速 UDP 互联网连接”，由谷歌创建并于 2013 年发布。其旨在化解 TCP 需要多次来回握手，才能建立连接并开始传输数据的短板。早在 IETF 颁布 HTTP/3 的意见征求稿前，谷歌就已经将 QUIC 支持内嵌于 Chrome 浏览器，并在谷歌的诸多服务上启用。Web 流量观测表明 HTTP/3 的流量已超过 HTTP/1.1。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我记得 HTTP/2 也不过才几年，现在都要开始普及 HTTP/3。真是风水轮流转，谁想到最主要的互联网应用 HTTP 最终会从 TCP 转向 UDP 呢。




谷歌再次打破圆周率计算纪录，计算出百万亿位

早在 2019 年，谷歌云服务就已经打破了圆周率的计算纪录，计算出了 31.4 万亿位。周三，谷歌云再次宣布打破了百万亿位的圆周率计算纪录。这 百万亿位圆周率 的最后 10 位是：30952 95560。谷歌云表示，其借助计算引擎服务完成了本次新挑战，用到了 N2 机器家族、虚拟网卡、100 Gbps 网络带宽，以及平衡持久磁盘等新功能。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：看似无用的圆周率计算，其实是谷歌云一次炫技的展示。有人说，任何大小的数字都能在圆周率的某个片段找到。不说百万亿位了，你能背出多少位圆周率呢？</span>

                              <span>编译软件在你如何运行你的系统方面给你很大的灵活性。LD_LIBRARY_PATH 变量，以及 GCC 的 -L 和 -l 选项，是这种灵活性的组成部分。


编译软件是开发者经常做的事情，在开源世界中，一些用户甚至选择自己动手。Linux 播客 Dann Washko 称源码为“通用包格式”，因为它包含了使一个应用在任何平台上运行所需的所有组件。当然，并不是所有的源码都是为所有的系统编写的，所以它只是在目标系统的子集内是“通用”的，但问题是，源码是非常灵活的。有了开源，你可以决定代码的编译和运行方式。

当你在编译代码时，你通常要处理多个源文件。开发人员倾向于将不同的类或模块放在不同的文件中，这样它们可以被单独维护，甚至可能被不同的项目使用。但当你编译这些文件时，许多文件会被编译成一个可执行文件。

这通常是通过创建共享库来完成的，然后从可执行文件中动态链接回它们。这样可以通过保持模块化功能的外部性来保持可执行文件的小型化，并确保库可以独立于使用它们的应用而被更新。

在编译过程中定位一个共享对象

当你 用 GCC 编译 时，你通常需要在你的工作站上安装一个库，以便 GCC 能够定位到它。默认情况下，GCC 假定库在系统库路径中，例如 /lib64 和 /usr/lib64。然而，如果你要链接到一个你自己的尚未安装的库，或者你需要链接到一个没有安装在标准位置的库，那么你必须帮助 GCC 找到这些文件。

有两个选项对于在 GCC 中寻找库很重要：


-L（大写字母 L）在 GCC 的搜索位置上增加一个额外的库路径。

-l（小写字母 L）设置你要链接的库的名字。


例如，假设你写了一个叫做 libexample.so 的库，并且你想在编译你的应用 demo.c 时使用它。首先，从 demo.c 创建一个对象文件：

$ gcc -I ./in…</span>

                              <span>机器学习基本上是人工智能的一个子集，它使用以前存在的数据对新数据进行预测。


当然，现在我们所有人都知道这个道理了！这篇文章展示了如何将 Python 中开发的机器学习模型作为 Java 代码的一部分来进行预测。



本文假设你熟悉基本的开发技巧并理解机器学习。我们将从训练我们的模型开始，然后在 Python 中制作一个机器学习模型。

我以一个洪水预测模型为例。首先，导入以下库：

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


当我们成功地导入了这些库，我们就需要输入数据集，如下面的代码所示。为了预测洪水，我使用的是河流水位数据集。

from google.colab import files
uploaded &#x3D; files.upload()
for fn in uploaded.keys(): 
    print(&#x27;User uploaded file &quot;{name}&quot; with length {length} bytes&#x27;.format(name&#x3D;fn, length&#x3D;len(uploaded[fn])))


如果没有选择文件的话，选择上传的文件。

只有在当前浏览器会话中执行了该单元格时，上传部件才可用。请重新运行此单元，上传文件 Hoppers Crossing-Hourly-River-Level.csv，大小 2207036 字节。

完成后，我们就可以使用 sklearn 库来训练我们的模型。为此，我们首先需要导入该库和算法模型，如图 1 所示。



from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor &#x3D; LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)


完成后，我们就训练好了我们的模型，现在可以进行预测了，如图 2 所示。



在 Java 中使用 ML 模型

我们现在需要做的是把 ML 模型转换成一个可以被 Java 程序使用的模型。有一个叫做 sklearn2pmml 的库可以帮助我们做到这一点：

# Install the library
pip install sklearn2pmml


库安装完毕后，我们就可以转换我们已经训练好的模型，如下图所示：

sklearn2pmml(pipeline, ‘model.pmml’, with_repr &#x3D; True)


这就完成了！我们现在可以在我们的 Java 代码中使用生成的 model.pmml 文件来进行预测。请试一试吧！

（LCTT 译注：Java 中有第三方库 jpmml/jpmml-evaluator，它能帮助你使用生成的 model.pmml 进行预测。）

Open source reading and editing tools for PDFs are often more secure and reliable alternatives to the applications residing in the first pages of &quot;PDF editor&quot; search results. There, you&#x27;re likely to see proprietary applications with hidden limitations and tariffs, lacking sufficient information about data protection policies and hosting. You can have better.
Here are five applications that can be installed on your Linux system (and others) or hosted on a server. Each is free and open source, with all the necessary features for creating, editing, and annotating PDF files.

The term orchestration is relatively new to the IT industry, and it still has nuance that eludes or confuses people who don&#x27;t spend all day orchestrating. When I describe orchestration to someone, it usually sounds like I&#x27;m just describing automation. That&#x27;s not quite right. In fact, I wrote a whole article differentiating automation and orchestration.
An easy way to think about it is that orchestration is just a form of automation. To understand how you can benefit from orchestration, it helps to understand what specifically it automates.

                              <span>这篇文章是我去年在公司内部的分享，当时Constraintlayout2.0还没Release，所以只在公司内部进行了分享，希望等Release之后，就可以正式在项目中使用了。
那么为什么我这么热衷于使用constraintlayout呢？从团队项目来说，3年前我刚进公司的时候，做了一次Constraintlayout1.0的分享，让大家了解到了这一强大的布局方式，大家也认识到了这一神器的强大，从那以后，constraintlayout在项目中的使用越来越广泛，以前可能需要很多代码计算才能实现的布局效果，利用Constraintlayout，可能一行Java代码都不用写，直接在XML布局中就能实现，这也体现了科技提高生产力的强大优势。
如果说Constraintlayout1.0是对静态布局的革命，那么这次Constraintlayout2.0的升级，则是对布局中的动画进行了革命，这是对Constraintlayout1.0布局基本形式的强大补充，至此，Constraintlayout几乎可以完全替代原始的布局方式，同时让动画的实现变的异常方便，所以，我会花几篇文章来阐述Constraintlayout2.0的革命之处。
不过，为了偷懒，这篇文章直接使用了去年中分享的内容，当时Constraintlayout2.0还未Release，所以可能有些地方和正式版本有些区别，不过不影响，因为整体是一致的。
这是本系列的第一篇文章，简述了Constraintlayout中MotionLayout的基本使用。

一、前言
FlutterUnit  虽然支持六端，但分为了三个分支：移动端和桌面端以及 web 端。这是由于历史遗留问题，起初 Flutter 稳定版 SDK 是不支持桌面开发，需要  master 版本的 SDK，在那时 FlutterUnit 就已经开始支持桌面版。为了让移动端在 稳定版 SDK 上开发符合大多数人的场景，所以选择新建分支让桌面端用  master 版本的 SDK 尝鲜体验。

一直以来 FlutterUnit 偏重于移动端，桌面端和 web 端基本处于能跑就像的状态。不过最近 Flutter 桌面端也在逐渐发展，windows 和 macOS 官方也已经宣布稳定支持。很多三方插件也支持了桌面版，越来越多的朋友开始向 Flutter 桌面端尝试，感觉也是时候将 桌面端 和 移动端 的代码进行合并。顺便记录一下其中需要注意的要点。
想要让一个只有 Android/iOS 的 Flutter 项目支持 windows ，只需要在项目根目录执行：
flutter create .

这样即可生成其他平台的源码文件，这里暂时不集成 web ，可以删掉。

二、SQLite 数据库的全平台支持
sqflite  目前已经支持了 Android、 iOS,  和 MacOS 平台；对 Windows 和 Linux 的支持，可以使用 sqflite_common_ffi

----&gt;[pubspec.yaml]----
dependencies:
  #...

                              <span>作为专业骑行科技厂商，佳明的码表占有率极高，尤其是在520时代，一群人出来骑车520一定是最多的。

事实上，520从来都不是一个很好用的自行车码表，佳明自己也很清楚这一点，只是仗着自己强大的GPS技术为所欲为，所以在间隔期也就出了一个520Plus来撑撑场面。再加上相较佳明，友商们不争气啊，给了机会抓不住。国产陷入了手机APP打造所谓生态圈的邪路，手机APP用着是方便是流畅屏幕还大，但是我真的不想骑车的时候在车头架个iPhone，先不说我那一体把能不能架风阻有多大，你说我要是摔车了是先捡手机还是先扶车还是先看人呢？简简单单的放个码表不好吗，续航还长还不怕风吹日晒。好不容易出个码表功能残缺不全，连支持个TSS都成了卖点。

而曾经凑合还能用的百锐腾不知道怎么就掉队了，新来的wahoo倒是抓住了佳明反人类软件设计这个痛点给佳明狠狠的捅了一刀，和手机无缝连接的感觉像是当年第一次用上智能手机，只是不知道为什么文字翻译非要用百度，好好的功率改个名字叫“翼”，都是些什么鬼……好吧，虽然520设定起来是很蛋疼，按键手感也很糟糕但好歹只需要设定一次，天天看着机翻实在是辣眼睛。能把520从王座上掀下了的还只能是佳明自己。于是，他们推出了520真正的换代产品Edge 530，顺便把年轻的820一起换成了830。

那么问题又来了，买哪个？530和830在功能上好像没什么区别啊，在官网上除了一个支持触屏一个不支持外根本看不出有什么区别，选择困难症要犯了，还是老办法，同类不同级买贵的，同级不同类就都买。于是就有了这篇530和830的对比评测。

先上结论，这一代530和830的不同只在于操作方法和逻辑，功能上几乎一模一样。嗯，就这一点让830比530贵了将近一倍。不同于上一代里只有820有完整的导航功能，这一代530内置了和830一毛一样的导航系统，从机内文件可以看出连地图都是一样的，相比于52…</span>

温度爬升，蚊虫也开始猖狂了起来。燥热的空气里，穿梭着几只置身死于度外的飞虫，全然没有在意我这个执掌着生死的巨人，让人钦佩。
一直在小公司徘徊，在小团队里面摸爬滚打。面试中往往会被面试官对于一些平时用不到的技能细致追问，想要跳高只能开始学习工作中用不到的技能，不然就会陷入死循环怪圈
你没这块工作经验，单位不要。
又因为没单位要，所以就没有工作经验。
所以只能自己偷偷默默学习，以demo当作经验。
名词解释
双亲委派机制 ：在类加载器中，指的是当一个类加载器收到了类加载的请求的时候，他不会直接去加载指定的类，而是把这个请求委托给自己的父加载器去加载。 只有父加载器无法加载这个类的时候，才会由当前这个加载器来负责类的加载。

插件化一直都没有尝试过。听起来高大上，重要的是面试中被问到的概率也是居高不下。
在开发过程中，不用安装app就能运行新的apk是多么美妙的事情，插件化对于我们的工程应用也有实际意义。本文就以compose Demo项目完整实现一下插件化。完成插件的生成装载，并成功跳转展示对应的插件页面。
一，插件化的方案
在Android中，真正安装一个apk的过程很简单，就只是将apk文件拷贝到对应的目录中，并且解压出对应的so文件就好了，其余就是一些解析，扫描组件，校验，dex优化的操作，用户安装包都是拷贝存放在data/app中。

TextView文本大小自动适配与TextView边距的去除
标题太难取了，其实本文主要就是讲如何控制文本大小，让其自动适配宽度，其次我们还需要精准控制Text的高度和宽度间距等属性。
一般我们的布局都是分 match parent 和 wrap content 而他们的自动方式又有所不同。下面看看都有哪些方式来实现！
一、Autosizing的方式(固定宽度)
官方推出的TextView的Autosizing方式，在宽度固定的情况下，可以设置最大文本Size和最小文本Size和每次缩放粒度，非常方便的就能实现该功能。
 

autoSizeTextType：设置 TextView 是否支持自动改变文本大小，none 表示不支持，uniform 表示支持。
autoSizeMinTextSize：最小文字大小，例如设置为10sp，表示文字最多只能缩小到10sp。
autoSizeMaxTextSize：最大文字大小，例如设置为18sp，表示文字最多只能放大到18sp。
autoSizeStepGranularity：缩放粒度，即每次文字大小变化的数值，例如设置为1sp，表示每次缩小或放大的值为1sp。
效果：

如果在Java代码中使用，我们也可以这么用
TextView tvText &#x3D; findViewById(R.id.tv_text);
TextViewCompat.setAutoSizeTextTypeWithDefaults(tvText,TextViewCompat.AUTO_SIZE_TEXT_TYPE_UNIFORM);
TextViewCompat.setAutoSizeTextTypeUniformWithConfiguratio…</span>

今天在提交app时，遇到授权前隐私不过的问题，所有的初始化都后置到授权后了，还是被报有获取mac地址和android_id的行为，这很是奇怪，自己也是无处下手，毕竟log里面是没有的，应用商店也没有提供堆栈。
经过一番查找，找到一套自测的工具，这里自己也记录并分享一下，手把手的来一步步操作，就可以自测了，废话不多说，下面按步骤来写了(无需ROOT)：
下载虚拟系统：VirtualXposed 0.22.0版本这个反正我用有问题，就用了0.20.3了~
压缩包里面有VirtualXposed_for_GameGuardian_0.20.3.apk 和 VirtualXposed_0.20.3.apk
将两个apk都安装到手机里面，桌面会看到VirtualXposed图标。
自行编译PrivacyCheck检测隐私打点工具或者可以用我编译好的 测试包privacy_check.apk
安装要检测的应用，我们这里随便拿个app来测试，就拿掘金来练手吧~ 现在桌面是这样的：
打开VirtualXposed，如果是全面屏记得恢复成普通导航，因为需要菜单功能。做安卓的应该知道菜单怎么调用，小米手机：长按任务键进入设置~~
点击添加应用：勾选PrivacyCheck和稀土掘金，点击下面的安装按钮。
弹框选择：VIRTUALXPOSED，等待安装结束，点击完成! 界面如下：
点击Xposed Installer，也就是最右面那个app。安装完成的样子：
在Xposed Installerapp里面，左上角点击侧滑栏，点击模块，勾选PrivacyCheck,如图：
返回到VirtualXposed界面，进入菜单，最下面有一个重启项，点击重启~ 很快就可以了~
返回到这个界面：
点击PrivacyCheckapp，启动完成后，看到就一行字，无需关心，此时切换应用回：VirtualXposed界面。（不要返回，直接应用间切换就好了，保持PrivacyCheck没有杀死。
打开终端（mac），输入：adb logcat | grep PrivacyCheck，回车，会看到这样一行：E PrivacyCheck: 加载app 包名:com.test.privacycheck。
打开要测试的app，这里是打开掘金app，不要点击同意，观察log输出：E PrivacyCheck: 加载app 包名:com.daimajia.gold，只输出了一行，看上去很不错，没有任何问题。
参考步骤5，打开其他测试app，比如我之前有问题的app，观察下log：
可以很清楚的看到错误堆栈，看到我这里是因为调用页面start的统计造成的，一下就想起来自己统计根页面时路径导致的，很容易就解决了~~
最后问题改动很简单，但查找的过程还比较麻烦，同时也学到了这种排查隐私的方法，希望也能帮到需要的人~~</span>

                              <span>Retrofit框架之美
  在众多安卓网络请求框架中，Retrofit无疑是最耀眼的那个：基于okhttp实现，迁移成本低、API设计简洁易用、注解化配置高度解耦、支持多种解析器、支持rxjava和协程。。。
  然而实际项目中，Retrofit有诸多不便，例如：返回值Call容易陷入嵌套地域、网上大多数CallAdapter方案需要手动try-catch、缺乏全局逻辑等。不过好消息是，得益于Retrofit强大的定制功能，我们可以逐一解决上诉的痛点，让Retrofit从一个花瓶变成一个具有实战意义的工具。
我们的目标是让Retrofit拥有以下功能和特性：
在协程下执行网络请求，让异步请求代码变成近似同步代码，消除嵌套地狱
网络API的注解自定义和逻辑自定义
增加可配置的全局结果转换器，例如返回的成功报文中，含有code为非0的结果，需要转换成错误的报文
网络请求方法不用手动try-catch异常，即方法不向上抛出，方法返回值包含网络异常
阅读本系列需要以下知识点：
kotlin
Hilt（最好了解）
Retrofit（基础或者使用过即可）
okhttp（了解拦截器的使用）

一：分析问题
  默认情况下，Retrofit支持Call的返回值，我们需要调用Call类中的方法来请求网络，然后通过回调来获取网络请求的成功和失败的结果。

        @GET(&quot;xxxxxx&quot;)
        fun getStudent(): Call

前言
在我的上一篇为什么Google要将LiveData设计成粘性的文章中，有一位爱思考的小伙伴留下了这么一个评论。

在看到这个评论后，我产生了两个疑问？
LiveData的观察者对象必须得处于主线程中吗？
究竟是什么原因让Google这么设计，正是这位小伙伴所述的原因吗？
由此有了这篇文章，再次感谢这位小伙伴的留言探讨。
观察者对象必须得处于主线程中吗？
先说答案：
是的，LiveData的观察者对象必须处于主线程中。
找到这个答案的方法也很简单，我们直接查看LiveData源码中的注册观察者方法即可。

Automatic Garbage Collection (GC) is one of the most important features that makes Java so popular. This article explains why GC is essential. It includes automatic and generational GC, how the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) divides heap memory, and finally, how GC works inside the JVM.
Java memory allocation
Java memory is divided into four sections:
Heap: The memory for object instances is allocated in the heap. When the object declaration is made, there won&#x27;t be any memory allocated in the heap. Instead, a reference is created for that object in the stack.

我在推荐 Notion 的时候，总是会提起 Notion 更适合大屏使用，这不仅是因为数据库的数据一旦多了，在手机屏幕上看就显得很局促，更是因为一旦数据多又遇上网络原因，Notion 在手机上加载的速度会变慢。
我目前不仅使用 Notion 作为主力的知识管理笔记软件，把正在学习的知识记录在 Notion 上，同时，Notion 也是我的 GTD 管理软件，我倾向于把待办事项或转瞬即逝的灵感记录在 Notion 对应页面里，方便事后直接对事项进行管理和追踪。
比如说，我不再在豆瓣上标记想看或正在看的电影条目，转而在 Notion 上新建一个数据库对它们进行管理。
这个时候，问题就来了。如果我刚好没有正在使用电脑，却需要在 Notion 里记录我想看某一部电影，但我的片单数据库很庞大，我受够了等待 Notion App 缓慢的加载，我不需要查看整个数据库，却要等待整个数据库加载完成。我就在想，有没有什么更快捷直接的方式可以让我不用打开 App 又可以往 Notion 发送数据呢？
于是我想起了「iOS 快捷指令」。
iOS 快捷指令
iOS 快捷指令是什么？对少数派的读者来说，想必是再熟悉不过了，我就不多介绍了。
在使用快捷指令往 Notion 发送数据的过程中，我们可能会用到这四个操作。
第一个是「要求输入」。这个操作会弹出一个对话框，要求用户输入信息。如果我们要发送到 Notion 的数据是自己手动输入的话，就可以用上它。

第二个是「获取剪贴板」。这个操作会把你刚刚复制的内容传递到下一个操作里。如果我们要把复制的内容发…</span>

                              <span>为什么要这么做？
昨天在推上看到一个视频，注意到他是使用 Sony ZV1 作为直播摄像头的。而作为一个视频制作者，我的不少视频都是以真人 + 教程的形式提供给我的观众的，我突然想起来，或许我可以使用手机来作为摄像头来完成视频的录制。
和 MBP 自带的摄像头相比，可以让我在视频中更加清晰、更加明亮，让我的视频的观众们可以更好的看到我（没错，就是这么自恋）。于是，我决定用我的备用机 — Pixel 6 来完成这个操作。
为什么是 Iriun Webcam
Iriun Webcam 的一个好处是免费版可以使用 4K，且免费版的水印也十分的不明显，对于白嫖用户十分友好。如果你需要完全去除水印或更加强大的控制能力，则可以付费获得。不过对于绝大多数场景，免费版足矣。
所需软件

macOS 驱动下载：https://iriun.com/
Android Play Store 应用：https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.jacksoftw.webcam
iOS App Store 应用：https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iriun-webcam-for-pc-and-mac/id1439303579?mt&#x3D;8

所需硬件

与手机适配的 USB 数据线：如果本地网络速度足够快，也可以不使用数据线。不过我推荐你使用 USB 数据线，主要是理论上会更加的稳定。

操作流程
安装软件
PC 端
想要实现软件连接，需要先下载安装相应的软件。Iriun Webcam 支持 WIndows 、 macOS 和 Ubuntu ，你只需要访问其官网，并下载对应的软件，并在本地进行安装即可

手机端
手机端则可以在你的手机上搜索 Irirun webcam，并进行安装。

配置设备连接
安装完成后，在 macOS 上打开 Iriun Webcam 会看到如下的界面，此时说明你的 PC 已经准备好了。

未连接状态的效果
在手机上打开同样的软件，稍等片刻，二者就会自动连接到一起

已连接状态的效果
换用 USB 连接
使用 Wi-Fi 连接的最大的问题是不稳定，以及延迟高。因此，你可以选择改用 USB 数据线进行连接，从而获得一个更低的延迟和更稳定的视频效果。
你需要先将自己的手机开启开发者选项，并开启「USB 调试」，随后将手机与电脑连接（如果有授权窗口，则授权 PC 进行调试）。

授权完成后，稍等片刻软件就会自动刷新，手机后的「Wi-Fi」变为「USB」，则说明你已经成功切换为使用 USB 连接。

配置软件摄像头
当你配置完成 Iriun 的 Webcam 之后，就可以在你日常使用的软件当中切换具体使用的摄像头为 Iriun Webcam 来获得从手机取得的视频画面。

腾讯会议的摄像头选择框
如果你使用 OBS 的话，还可以将音频输入修改为 Iriun Webcam audio （腾讯会议并不支持），来获取手机当中传递过来的音频信号。

总结
使用手机摄像头来替代 Mac Book Pro 上自带的摄像头可以帮助我们获得一个更好的画质和视频观看体验。相比于购买一个全新的摄像头，不妨用上你的旧手机来完成你的直播诉求。而你所需要的，不过是一款免费软件 + 一根 USB 数据线。</span>

博客探索
2005 年，我开始用博客记录感想，发布在 MSN space 平台和短命的 Google Sidewiki 上。六年后，MSN space 关闭 ，博客被转移到 WordPress 托管，我改用 Blogger，没多久就暂停了博客。
2018 年，我偶然接触到 Jekyll，被其简洁的界面和便捷性打动，重新恢复了博客记录。博客方向从感想记录转变到知识整理输出。Jekyll 方案需要首先在本地用 Markdown 编辑排版，然后同步到 GitHub 发布，最后以 Markdown 格式手动分发到各个渠道。当文章较少时，这套方案的体验感特别好。
到了 2021 年，随着文章和发布渠道的增多，文章的修改和管理变得愈加困难。慢慢地，我开始习惯本地 Markdown 只做初稿排版，更新则只在外部平台上进行。
我的文章都是工具教程类，要随着工具的更新而修改，有时甚至要对几年前发布的文章进行更新。因此，针对少量平台更新的策略，带来了文章版本混乱，让博客偏离了知识记录的初衷。为了保证文章版本统一，我把博客从 Jekyll 迁移到 WordPress，准备以 WordPress 作为统一版。

然而，WordPress 方案很快就被放弃了。原因除了 WordPress 糟糕的编辑体验，更重要的是，我遇到了 Notion。其界面美观，编辑方便，支持对外展示，能导出为 Markdown、HTML 文件。
可是，没什么平台是完美的。Notion 不支持同步本地 markdown 内容，图床不能在站外使用，国内访问速度成谜。这令 Notion…</span>

                              <span>今年还要再去一次三亚！
这可能是我和女友自去年六月三亚回来之后，说的最多的愿望了。去年六月初，我们俩人趁着旅游旺季还没来临之前，特地请了4天的假期，搭上一个端午假期，才终于让我们期盼已久的海岛之旅成行。（辛苦打工人年中旅游实属不易啊🥲 ）
迟到了一年的海岛漫游指南，希望能给今年的你提供一些帮助。
海边日落-三亚湾
行前准备：天气预报可能是最不需要的东西🌤
5月中旬-10月中旬是海南的雨季，而且往往伴随着各类热带气旋的光临。我从做攻略开始就非常担心去玩的那一周天天下雨。如果你去查未来15天三亚天气预报，通常会看到这样一个劝退人的画面：
海南三亚6月未来15天天气预报
但其实海南的热带气候还是非常靠谱的。
预报下雨的一天可能只会间歇性地下1-2个小时的阵雨。趁着下雨在酒店瘫一会儿，出门就又是大太阳了。因此，千万别被天气预报劝退，在海南的雨季，一般的天气预报可能是最不需要的东西。我们去的那周甚至遇上了台风天，但是半天的狂风暴雨之后，一切正常。
唯一需要注意的就是要注意避开台风天入岛或出岛，以免长时间的途中延误。
怎么走：自驾，应该是体验海岛的最佳选择🚗
不同的出入岛方式可能会有不小的成本差异。
我们的选择是：
入岛路线：上海 - 直飞 - 三亚
出岛路线：三亚 - 高铁 - 海口；海口 - 直飞 - 上海
比起往返直飞三亚，可以省下约1000元的旅费。
出入岛的排列组合方式非常丰富，从海口到三亚的动车只需1.5小时，因此完全可以根据你的情况考虑海南的各个机场出入岛。
海南岛内交通示意
而对于岛内的出行，我个人只推荐一种：自驾。
三亚市内公共交通并不发达，而且大部分景点都在中心城区范围之外。
不论是公交还是打车，都会旅途带来不少的麻烦和不便。如果你有计划去免税店逛逛，我强烈建议自驾前往。免税店门口总有一堆人在排队打车，如果真的打车出行非常影响购物体验。
相对的，三亚的租车行业…</span>

前言
谈到 Android 架构，相信谁都能说上两句。从 MVC，MVP，MVVM，再到时下兴起 MVI，架构设计层出不穷。如何为项目选择合适架构，也成常备课题。
由于架构并非空穴来风，每一种设计都有其存在依据。唯有高频痛点熟稔于心，才能技术选型事半功倍。所以今天我们一起探寻 “架构演化” 来龙去脉，相信阅读后你会豁然开朗。

前言
原生架构

原始图形化架构

高频痛点 1：Null 安全一致性问题
原始工程架构 MVC

高频痛点 2：成员变量爆炸
高频痛点 3：状态管理一致性问题
高频痛点 4：消息分发一致性问题
它山之石

矫枉过正 MVP

反客为主 Presenter
简明易用 三方库
拨乱反正 MVVM

曲高和寡 DataBinding
未卜先知 mBinding
力挽狂澜

官方牵头 Jetpack

一举多得 ViewModel
读写分离 LiveData
半路杀出 Kotlin

喜闻乐见 ViewBinding
百花齐放

最佳实践 Jetpack MVVM

屏蔽回推 UnPeekLiveData
严格模式 DataBinding
前后通吃 Kotlin Flow
消除样板 MVI
另起炉灶 Compose
综上
原生架构
原始图形化架构
完整软件服务，通常包含客户端和服务端。
Linux 服务端，开发者通过命令行操作；Android 客户端，面向普通用户，须提供图形化操作。为此，Android 将图形系统设计为，通过客户端 Canvas 绘制图形，并交由 Surface Flinger 渲染。
但正如《过目难忘 Android GUI 关系梳理》所述，复杂图形绘制离不开排版过程，而开发者良莠不齐，如直接暴露 …</span>

Writers are always looking for better ways to put their words and ideas into readable formats to share with their readers. My first experiences with word processing came in my Apple II days when I used AppleWorks and later FrEDWriter, which was a free word processing application created in 1985. It was the standard for my students, many of whom came from households that lacked the money to purchase proprietary software.

When I made the switch to Linux in the late 1990&#x27;s, I was looking for high quality writing software that I could use and recommend to students who chose to follow my lead in the world of open source software. The first word processor I became fam…</span>

The following article is a companion to my presentation at Drupalcon and Drupalcamp covering Progressive Web Apps implementations.
Progressive Web Apps (PWA) have support from some of the top tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, with the common goal being &quot;Web apps should be able to do anything iOS, Android, or desktop apps can.&quot; PWAs can add value to businesses at a variety of different stages. All projects have limitations, whether they be development resources, timeline, budget, or technical debt. Even with &quot;unlimited resources,&quot; developing an app from a single codebase, using commonly known web technologies, allows for a more frictionless, san…</span>

                              <span>这是一篇万字长文，主要涉及以下三个部分：
第一部分：理解对方。相较于《非暴力沟通》中的观察、行动、感受、请求等步骤的目的是通过用非暴力的表达方式让对方理解自己，即将介绍的「知觉检核」技巧更加倾向于带着一种开放的态度尝试去理解对方；第二部分：管理情绪。情绪看似是外力作用的结果，其实是知觉产生的想法所导致的结果；第三部分：展现自我。虽然自我的概念在很大程度上是由天性决定的，但在沟通的过程中可以被塑造，「自我袒露」的深度和广度决定着一段关系的亲密程度。
先对上篇文章《沟通的艺术｜学校错过的课程，现在补上也不晚》中提到的沟通的定义做个简单回顾：

人际沟通是一个交流的过程，其参与者们处于不同但又有所重叠的背景下，经由交换信息来创造价值和建立关系，过程中会受到外在、生理和心理的噪音干扰。

「不同背景」是沟通中客观存在的前提条件，「交换信息」是在沟通的过程中我们主动进行的行为，而「创造价值和建立关系」是我们「交换信息」的目的，或者是沟通这个行为产生的结果。上篇文章详细介绍了沟通的定义，和在「交换信息」时起到先导作用的「倾听」的技巧和注意事项。本篇文章的重点则是「交换信息」时本身的动作，了解人们理解信息的一般过程，以及「噪音干扰」会对「创造价值和关系」造成什么影响。
理想中的沟通

当我们倾听对方说话时，如果能意识到双方有着不同的背景，就可以明白为什么对方的某些行为让自己觉得无法理喻：因为不同的「教育/生活背景」差异会导致两人的知觉产生巨大的偏差。通过使用「知觉检核」技巧可以准确地理解对方；如果能意识到沟通会受到噪音干扰，我们就可以理解为什么在情绪上头时进行的沟通往往会造成让人后悔莫及的结果，因为我们的大脑会受到愤怒等「生理噪音」的干扰从而变的不那么理智。通过了解正确的「情绪管理」技巧能够帮助我们识别自己和对方的情绪并加以控制。
当我们尝试说服对方时，如果能意识到沟通会受噪音干扰，就可…</span>

                              <span>距离上一次更新，已经是两周前。因为换了个新环境，也需要处理很多事情，所以时间很紧，无法像之前那样有大把的时间获取和筛选各种信息、思考和主题式写作。
如果一个问题和道理总是反复出现在自己的反思里，那么这个问题就会逐渐得到自己的重视。我在 2 个多月以前，我也因为搬家没有时间写作，产生了焦虑。
焦虑的本质原因是「期待自我」与「现实自我」产生了较大距离。内心期待自己能每周更新深度的带有主题的内容，但现实的自我却因为时间紧做不到，而我又接受不了停更。
所以我的解决办法是：调整「期待自我」。去感受当下正在做事的价值。不苛责自己，顺应情绪脑和直觉，因为能轻易驱动身体这台沉重的机器的不是「理性脑」，而是「情绪脑」、「本能脑」，又因人作为动物，容易受环境影响，所以用心感受当下才能活得更自如。
我的笔记截图
让自己产生写作灵感的提问机器，往往藏在自己的亲历而非臆想中。我当时在搬家的时候，也曾深刻体会了「把指数型问题拆解成线型问题」的方法。
同样的，虽然最近没有时间去看更多的书籍和文章，但我仍然可以把我来到义乌的所见所闻，整理成一些可以分享的内容，给你看。一来，可以和正在阅读的你保持联系；二来，我也希望自己能通过完整文章的方式来整理我最近的思绪，让思考流动起来。
特别感谢我的女友，她给我说：你的专业的内容挺难读的，大家关心的其实不仅是你的内容，而是你这个活生生的人，你可以分享你的经历，即使不是事件的参与者，也能成为一个观察者。这有鼓励到我去摆脱之前的束缚，按照自己的意愿来分享自己所见所想。
接下来，我就试着分享一些我在新来的城市——义乌的所见所闻。
🏠 义乌的租房
来义乌住下酒店后，我们一边处理新的仓库工作，一边找房子。义乌租房和其它地方不一样，大多按年租来付款的。如果想按月租，只能去城中村的库存街里去问。

                              <span>从去年传出退出中国流言开始，到近期靴子落地，宣布正式退出中国，Kindle这个过于专注的电子阅读器，终于还是敌不过多变的市场。亚马逊溃败中国，跨境电商和Kindle是坚持运营的两大业务。数据显示，自2016年起，中国便已经成为了Kindle设备销售的全球第一大市场，关停服务无疑会影响无数用户的生活。
关切、怀念、告别，今天就用这一文章说一说，不过首先还是来一番文化批评，说说阅读这件事。
阅读的定义早已改变，功利主义让Kindle显得难能可贵
从任何一个角度来说，我都不是一个读书的人。不喜欢读书，有很多理由，从应试教育开始养成的功利主义，天然让我们抗拒读书这件事，另外便是没有时间，或者说精力，让我们在这个缺乏注意力、非常疲惫的时代，给它多分配一点。
但这说的是读书，假如说更为宽泛的阅读，其实我并不惭愧。仅在知乎一个平台，我每年的阅读量都能达到几十万字，有一年甚至相当于《四库全书》。当然，你可以说这是碎片阅读，但是它的确开始受到承认，在今年我国发布的读书日白皮书中，互联网化的阅读也算入了其中，大大拉升我国成年人的阅读数据表现。
阅读的内涵在扩大，当然你还可以说，除了知乎、公众号之外，还有各种形式的内容消费，其内在都是严密文本作为基础的，比如这两年开始的风气就是文字转视频，做公众号的都开始做视频，当然还有各类播客、有声书等等。甚至来说看电影前读的豆瓣影评都可以是一种阅读。
前些日子，奥迪抄袭一位短视频自媒体博主的文案上了热搜，从常规的语境下看，那条短视频就是分享节气的内涵解读，但是在奥迪抄袭包装以后、影帝刘德华念出来以后，大家都觉得是极其有文化的、充满文学气息的文案。
结果反转，尤其是那首所谓曾国藩的诗，从来抄袭源一错到底，让人倍感讽刺。
我们的浮躁和功利主义，它的演化路径，从一个贩售读书文化的商人创业故事就能看清楚，这个人就是梁文道。最早凤凰卫视挖掘他，每天下午给他8分钟时间做…</span>

此工具提供用户行为（手势、文字输入）的录制及回放，同时支持记录的导出和导入。
例如，可以由测试人员进行bug复现步骤的录制及上传，并由对应开发人员下载导出再重放。当然也可以用于线上用户的反馈。
Tip:
1.此工具目前支持 flutter 2.5.3-null-safety，
-&gt;如果是其他版本的flutter可以查看Beike_AspectD是否支持，或者自行fork进行相关适配即可
2.动图可能有点儿大。
行为的录制和回放

行为记录的导出、导入及回放

实现
两种行为的录制都是基于hook实现的，
这里做一下简单介绍。
手势录制及回放
录制
手势的录制通过hook GestureBinding的-handlePointerEvent方法,对平台端所传递过来的pointer event进行转换并生成PointerEventBundle 存储在队列中。
void _hookHandlePointerEvent(PointCut pointCut) {
  gestureRecorder.handleHook(pointCut);
  pointCut.proceed();
}

class GestureRecorder extends Recorder{

  ///...其它代码

  @override
  void handleHook(PointCut pointCut) {

Provider Modifiers
所有的Provider都有一个内置的方法来为你的不同Provider添加额外的功能。
它们可以为 ref 对象添加新的功能，或者稍微改变Provider的consume方式。Modifiers可以在所有Provider上使用，其语法类似于命名的构造函数。
final myAutoDisposeProvider &#x3D; StateProvider.autoDispose((ref) &#x3D;&gt; 0);
final myFamilyProvider &#x3D; Provider.family((ref, id) &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;$id&#x27;);

目前，有两个Modifiers可用。
.autoDispose，这将使Provider在不再被监听时自动销毁其状态
.family，它允许使用一个外部参数创建一个Provider
一个Provider可以同时使用多个Modifiers。
final userProvider &#x3D; FutureProvider.autoDispose.family((ref, userId) async {
  return fetchUser(userId);
});

.family
.family修饰符有一个目的：根据外部参数创建一个独特的Provider。family的一些常见用例是下面这些。
将FutureProvider与.family结合起来，从其ID中获取一个Message对象
将当前的Locale传递给Provider，这样我们就可以处理国际化
family的工作方式是通过向Provider添加一个额外的参数。然后，…</span>

前言
Transform API 是 AGP1.5 就引入的特性，主要用于在 Android 构建过程中，在 Class转Dex的过程中修改 Class 字节码。利用 Transform API，我们可以拿到所有参与构建的 Class 文件，然后可以借助ASM 等字节码编辑工具进行修改，插入自定义逻辑。
国内很多团队都或多或少的用 AGP 的 Transform API 来搞点儿黑科技，比如无痕埋点，耗时统计，方法替换等。但是在AGP7.0中Transform已经被标记为废弃了，并且将在AGP8.0中移除。而AGP8.0应该会在今年内发布，可以说是已经近在眼前了。所以现在应该是时候了解一下，在Transform被废弃之后，该怎么适配了。
Transform Action介绍
Transform API是由AGP提供的，而Transform Action则是由Gradle提供。不光是 AGP 需要 Transform，Java 也需要，所以由 Gradle 来提供统一的 Transform API 也合情合理。
Transform API被废弃的原因，既然Gradle已经统一提供了API，AGP也就没必要自定义一套了。
关于 TransformAction 如何使用，Gradle 官方已经提供了很详细的文档–Transforming dependency artifacts on resolution，具体使用可以直接参考文档
AsmClassVisitorFactory介绍
直接使用Transform Action的话还是有些麻烦，跟Transform API一样，需要手动处理增量编译的逻辑。AGP很贴心的为我们又做了一层封装，提供了AsmClassVisitorFactory来方便我们使用Tran…</span>

                              <span>本篇分享一个简单轻松的内容： ThemeExtensions  和 Material3 ，它们都是 Flutter 3.0 中的重要组成部分，相信后面的小知识你可能还没了解过～。
ThemeExtensions
相信大家都用过 Flutter 里的  Theme ，在 Flutter 里可以通过修改全局的   ThemeData  就来实现一些样式上的调整，比如 ：全局去除 InkWell 和 TextButton 的点击效果。
theme: ThemeData(
   primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
   // 去掉 InkWell 的点击水波纹效果
   splashFactory: NoSplash.splashFactory,
   // 去除 InkWell 点击的 highlight
   highlightColor: Colors.transparent,
   textButtonTheme: TextButtonThemeData(
     // 去掉 TextButton 的水波纹效果
     style: ButtonStyle(splashFactory: NoSplash.splashFactory),
   ),
),

当然，开发者也可以通过  Theme.of(context) 去读取 ThemeData 的一些全局样式，从而让自己的控件配置更加灵活，但是如果  ThemeData  里没有符合你需求的参数，或者你希望这个参数只被特定控件是用，那该怎么办 ？
Flutter 3 给我们提供了一个解决方案： ThemeExtensions  。
开发者可以通过继承 ThemeExtension  并 override 对应的  copyWith 和 lerp  方法来自定义需要拓展的  ThemeData 参数，比…</span>

随着项目的运营推广，总少不了各种客户定制化的需求，当前大部分软件其实都离不开Saas的玩法；定制化需求虽然利润高(特别是海外客户)，但对于开发人员来说却比较难搞，同一套代码需要支持不同的需求。
一般我们处理这种需求的时候会引入渠道包的概念，每个客户拥有独立渠道，通过渠道指定不同的资源、赋予不同的功能，从而编译出定制化的版本。
本篇文章将分享Flutter中如何进行移动端（iOS、Android）的渠道编译，替换应用图标、名称、appkey等。
Android端
1、配置build.grade
Android端的打包配置，主要是通过build.grade文件进行配置，在android目录下加入flavorDimensions，然后配置不同的风味维度；
android {
    // ......
    flavorDimensions &#x27;channel&#x27;
    productFlavors {
        develop {
            applicationId &quot;${defaultConfig.applicationId}&quot;
        }
        customer {
            applicationId &quot;${defaultConfig.applicationId}&quot; // 可替换成客户的AppID
        }
        productFlavors.all {
            // 遍历productFlavors多渠道，设置渠道名称，在flutter层也能取到
            flavor -&gt; flavor.manifestPlaceholders.put(&quot;CHANNEL&quot;, name)

距离上一次正儿八经的技术文章已经过去了三个月，这段时间里除了上一篇文章提到的换工作以外（入职字节跳动，和下一步的计划）。经过两个多月的面试，我的 GDE (Google Developer Expert) 申请也完成了所有流程，成为了国内第 5 位 Flutter &amp; Dart 方向 GDE。
下方是收到的所有流程邮件，按倒序排列。从资质评估、两轮面试，再到协议签署的最终确认。

成为 GDE 可以获得什么？
引用 恋猫de小郭：从台下到台上，我成为 GDE（谷歌开发者专家） 的经验分享 中的总结：
GDE 是 Google 在全球范围内开展的一个开发者专家认证项目，成为 GDE 除了是对你的技术和影响力认可之外，你还可以获得：
提前获悉谷歌内部产品路线或者技术变更的相关信息；
直接和 Google 产品团队沟通技术问题，获得一些 Google 内测资格；
谷歌活动邀请，如 I/O 大会并报销差旅；
JetBrains 会为所有 GDE 提供免费的 JetBrains 全家桶；
我能成为 GDE 么？
看到上面的诸多好处，在心动的同时你可能心里也在想：
我能成为 GDE 么？
我在去年读到 Alex 分享我成为 GDE（Google 开发者专家）的经历 文章时，也是一样的状态。
心理上的设障可能是阻止我们前进的最大因素。
当我回过头看整个申请过程，可以很确定和大家说：
是的，每个人都有成为 GDE 的机会
在我看来，「GDE 是 Google 对于你在某项技术上所做出贡献的认可，更加看重你的技术影响力」。这个项目并不考察学历，公司，人人都有机会成为 GDE。
所以他难么？他没有任何门槛，只要你足够热爱某项技术并且愿意付出。
但他不难么？你可能在想技术贡献如何进行评估？下面和大家分享下我整个申请过程的准备。

                              <span>夏天，大概就是阳光、小裙子、微风和——满满一冰箱的冰饮料！
其实 4 月末的时候深圳已经差不多进入夏天了，在家晒太阳喝无糖饮料的日子已经过了一个多月，终于想写写这些幸福时光🥰
记得刚来深圳的时候，我喝奶茶还要全糖，不理解一切降低甜度的人，甜点儿不好吗？
现在……已经不怎么喝奶茶了，甜点儿的东西都觉得腻，平时最常喝东方树叶，奶茶类饮料喝就是无糖或微微甜。夏天有一阵子喜欢喝柠檬茶，点邻里的柠檬茶最是离谱，他家外卖会自己标自己的无糖柠檬茶「非常难喝」，其实我喝着还不错来着…… ┓( ´∀&#x60; )┏
总之，这篇文章就写一下，夏天喝起来清爽无负担的那些夏日冰饮~
（所以这么看来这有可能是一篇测评
注：严格意义上来讲，这里写的饮料主要指不另外加糖的。以及，由于个人不喜欢代糖的味道，不写代糖产品~
我为夏天打下的江山
茶饮料
东方树叶  4.2元/瓶
真爱！一天可以喝 1-2 瓶的那种，每次从冰箱拿出来都觉得很幸福。
一般是京东或者天猫超市买，15 瓶一箱 64 元，均价 4.2元/瓶，500ml 一瓶。
最好喝的！
最喜欢茉莉花茶的，其次是绿茶。之前出了小瓶装的雨前龙井也很好喝，不过好像是季节限定，只喝过一次后面就没见过了。
只喝过一次的季节限定
玄米茶也还行，味道……总感觉更适合秋冬。青柑普洱是个人最不喜欢的一款……
三得利乌龙茶  3.8元/瓶
乌龙茶里超多好评的一款。我不太喜欢乌龙茶，所以其实感觉一般般，不过公司饮料柜没有矿泉水的时候，也会喝这个。
看了一下京东，57 元一箱 15 瓶，均价 3.8元/瓶，500ml 一瓶，也还不错。

最近又喝到了三得利的茉莉乌龙茶，感觉比纯乌龙更好喝（可能我是茉莉真爱），均价 4.9元/瓶，贵了一点点。但是值得试试！
图就很好看
冷泡茶  ？/瓶
茶叶放矿泉水瓶里冰箱冷藏过夜。家里倒是有明后毛峰的野茶，我也只是买茶叶的时候看到据说有这种喝法，…</span>

Android 10 首次引入了全局返回手势，但直到返回触发才能看到目标上层画面。13 针对该特性进行了优化，即返回触发之前可以预览上层画面。同时彻底废弃了返回键相关的 API，这将对现有的 App 逻辑产生巨大的影响！
前言
Android 13 针对包括手机、大屏、折叠屏等 Android 设备推出了可预见型返回手势（Predictive Back Gesture）特性。该特性将便于用户在返回完成之前可以先预览到目标画面或结果，这样的话可以允许他们决定是否要继续返回或者放弃并停留在当前画面。

另外引入关于 KEYCODE_BACK KeyEvent 相关的一系列变更。
为节省篇幅和统一认识，后续的相关描述将按照如下规则简称：
本次引入的可预见型返回手势 + KEYCODE_BACK 系列变更：统称为新返回导航
KEYCODE_BACK KeyEvent：简称为 KEYCODE_BACK
传统导航模式和 Swipe-Up 导航模式下的返回按钮：简称为Back KeyButton
全局返回手势：简称为Back Gesture
Back KeyButton
Back Gesture













后续将按照如下几个方面去阐述：
新返回导航的具体影响
如何确定是否受影响
适配方案的选择
适配方案的详述
SDK API 适配方案的深入探讨
新返回导航支持与否的深入比较和原理分析
注意和残留事项
1. 新返回导航的具体影响
简单来说会产生如下影响：
返回手势的可预见型 UI 的增强：展示返回触发前上层画面
原有 API 废弃：
KEYCODE_BACK：详述见小章节
Activity/Dialog:onBackPressed()

背景
年初开始我们就开始了关于Gradle Sync阶段的优化。之前和大家都简单的介绍过工程相关的背景情况了，我们大概有400+的Module，然后一次的同步时间就非常的慢，我们迫切的需要对这个问题进行优化。大部分工作都是和团队内的同学一起完成的，我也只出了一点点力而已。
这次写文章真的很倒霉，之前忘了保存导致要重新开始写了。如果不是白嫖了掘金的端午礼盒，拿人手短啊，我已经打算鸽了这篇文章了。
方法论
很多人听到方法论三个字，就觉得我要开始pua，说我阿里味，但是我觉得这个查问题的方式可能会对大家有点帮助。
很多人都会有这样的困扰，给你的一个工作内容是一个你完全陌生的东西，第一选择是逃避然后开始摆烂。我记得前一阵子和一个网友聊天，他有一次面试的时候也问了这样的问题。这次同步优化其实也相似的问题,是一个对我来说相对比较陌生的东西。
我就是想说下我们是如何来拆解这个问题的。首先需要一些对应相关的基础知识，我去官网查看了些对应的文档资料，仔细的了解了Gradle生命周期相关的，看看能不能对我们后续有所帮助，这个对于后续优化其实是非常重要的。

然后我通过我们的一个monitor插件，我看了大概一个礼拜的同步相关的编译日志，发现了一蛛丝马迹的。monitor就是一个通过BuildOperationNotificationListenerRegistrar把编译信息都记录到一个本地文件夹下的html中，然后把这些信息都发布都远端，方便后续排查问题。
这个monitor插件我在github上进行了一次kotlin翻译
问题大概如下:
遍历工程文件夹速度过慢，耗时大概1分钟左右
所有依赖全部切换成源码之后因为工程太多，所以展开速度过慢
Configuration之后竟然有个很慢的东西，占据了大量的耗时
这个就是我的方法论，通常碰到一个比较大的问题，我会把…</span>

1.关于 Compoent 树
如下图场景，每个显示的物体都是 Component ，它们形成一个树形结构。代码见 【11/01】

各种角色通过 add 方法添加到树中，此时的树型结构如下：

现在有个问题：因为血条和血量是被加入到 Adventurer 构件中的，所以 Adventurer 的变换行为也会引起血条的变换。如下角色沿 Y 轴镜像，可以看到血条及文字也发生了镜像，这并不是我们所期望的。

It&#x27;s not a secret that maintaining an open source project is often thankless and time-consuming work. However, I&#x27;ve learned that there&#x27;s one shared joy among open source maintainers: They love building with a group of technologists who passionately believe in their vision.
Marketing feels cringey
Community support and teamwork are major incentives for open source maintainers. However, gaining community support and contributors is a challenge, especially as a new maintainer. The hope is that technologists will find our projects and start contributing by chance. The reality is we have to market our projects. Think about it: Developers create …</span>

1. Component 生命周期回调一览
所谓生命周期，就是一个对象从生到死的过程。在上一篇中介绍过 Component 的生命周期状态 (LifecycleState) 有如下六种。可能很多人分不清什么是生命周期，什么是生命周期回调。

生命周期，本质上是一种 状态 ，也就是说它是一种数据；而生命周期回调是一个函数，或说方法，一般来说该函数会在状态切换时触发，从而让外界可以感知到对象的状态变化，以此实现某…</span>

前言
在 Flutter 中，若我们需要自定义画一张图，则需要用到 CustomPaint，不过 CustomPaint 并不是本篇文章的重点，所以我就直接贴出  CustomPaint  的相关代码，保证能够正常绘制即可。
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

  const MyHomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State createState() &#x3D;&gt; _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.white,
      child: CustomPaint(
        painter: MyPainter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyPainter extends CustomPainter {
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    canvas.drawRect(const Rect.fromLTRB(50, 50, 200, 200), Paint());
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}

Code for applications written using C usually has multiple source files, but ultimately you will need to compile them into a single executable.
You can do this in two ways: by creating a static library or a dynamic library (also called a shared library). These two types of libraries vary in terms of how they are created and linked. Your choice of which to use depends on your use case.
In a previous article, I demonstrated how to create a dynamically linked executable, which is the more commonly used method. In this article, I explain how to create a statically linked executable.

而作为一个持有多个 Kindle 的 Kindle 读者，我愿意称自己为 Kindle 难民。不过，难民归难民，在当下还是要思考接下来怎么处理。出二手我肯定是不打算，因为 Kindle 官方的新闻一出， Kindle 在二手市场的价格必然是要暴跌的（倒是可以从收藏的视角来在二手市场上收一些想要的 Kindle）。继续使用的话，就要想 Kindle 对我们的影响有多大。
先说结论：

对于喜欢线上购买图书并等 Kindle 推送的人来说，有可切换方案；
对于喜欢使用 Send To Kindle 的人来说，有可切换方案；
对于喜欢使用 Kindle 硬件来读书的人，继续使用数据线就行，不影响你的使用。
对于想要趁机切换至其他平台人来说，是个好时候，各家应该会做定向的营销。

再说细节：
1. Kindle 停止运行的重要时间节点
Kindle 对于我们的影响主要是在两个时间点：2023 年 6 月 23 日和 2024 年 6 月 40 日。

在 2023 年的 6 月 23 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 商店当中购买我们喜欢的图书（还有一年时间缓冲）。
在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 当中下载我们已经购买好的图书。
在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日之后，我们只能通过 Kindle 数据线连接电脑的方式来下载图书到 Kindle 当中阅读。

所以从短期来看，我们依然可以继续使用 Kindle 愉快的读书而没有丝毫的影响。但长期来看，如果你更喜欢线上随时选购的方案，那迁移到其他平台是必然的选择。
2. Kindle 商店停止运行后，还能做什么？
国区 Kindle 商店的停止运行，让我们失去随时购买图书的体验，如果我们想要继续可以实…</span>

1. Component 的树形结构
通过前面八篇的尝鲜，或说预热，我们可以感知到无论是主角、怪兽、文字、子弹、触点都是 Component 。它是游戏的基本构建模块，可以表示任何需要被渲染、更新的内容。

下面是 Component 类的部分结构，可以看出 Component 是一个普通类。其本身会持有父级构件，以及子级构件集合。也就是说 Component 本身是一个树形结构的节点类，认识到这一点至关重要。

正是由于树形结构的特点，C…</span>

                              <span>最近两天看完了我 2022 年第一本纸质书，麦家新作《人生海海》。今年都快过去一半了，看完了 16 本书，1 本纸质书，15 本都是在微信读书上看的电子书。但是，最爱还是纸质书。

阿根廷著名文学家博尔赫斯说过一句话，“这世界上如果有天堂，应该是图书馆的模样”，那我觉得图书馆应该是纸质书的天堂。很难想象，置身电子图书馆，周围没有一本纸质书，闭着眼睛都能感受到一种冷清的气氛。相比纸质书，我觉得它保留了读书人的气质，温文尔雅有感情的气质。
不过话说回来，纸质书与电子书的讨论一直没有停止，围绕它们俩的优缺点，能说上一大堆，我以自己一个喜欢读书的学生的视角，说说我眼中的纸质书。
纸质书的缺点
重量
我从网上查到的信息显示，一本 16 开 300 页左右的书大约在 180g~240g 之间，对比我们日常使用的手机，也在 180g~250g 之间，俗称半斤重的手机（参考 iPhone 13 Pro Max），这其实说明纸质书是比较笨重的，单本书的重量或许能接受，但遇到那种分上下册，或者需要同时带两本以上的书在身上时，就显得特别的不方便。
当然，也有的人选择在固定的场所和时间看书，比如只在自己的房间书桌上，这样即便是很重很厚的书，也没有多大的影响。
体积
我房间里有一个二合一的书桌，桌子与书柜二合一，说大不大的书柜，也装满了我从小到大看的书，要是还想继续往里面放，就有点困难了，一是占空间，二是容易积灰，遇到南方的回潮天，纸质书也容易受潮发霉，需要不定时拿出来翻动晒一晒。
价格
高三有一次看大冰的《小孩》，作者提到该书定价的事情，39.6 元，这是大冰和编辑“博弈”之后的结果，《小孩》是大冰有史以来字数最多的一本书，在如今的市场规律与成本重压之下，仍然以不高于 40 元的定价，已经很难得了。在编辑的推荐语上，也写着“他怕他的读者买不起书，怕他的读者饿着肚子花一天的饭钱买书”。 难怪被网友恶…</span>

需求
这学期，我们这儿从头到尾上网课，有些让人始料未及。
其实从 2020 年开始，上网课已经不新鲜了。但是一门课完全线上进行，甚至还包括了在线考试，这还真是第一次。
很多老师，都在担心教学效果，毕竟线上线下的环境差别很大。我一开始也不例外，着实有些焦虑。好在经过实践，发现因为有了飞书和 芦笋这样的工具，教学效果最大程度上有了保障。甚至，还收获了一些超越线下教学的益处。本文，我把自己的使用经验分享给你。主要分成以下 4 个部分：

视频会议；
通知与资料分享；
分组协作；
检索回放。

会议
首先，是飞书的视频会议功能。
我这学期开设了两门课，一门本科生，一门研究生的。我把全部的授课互动，都放在飞书会议里进行。
飞书的会议，有个非常大的好处，就是会议的组织者可以对谁该参加，谁还没加入来，可以做到一目了然。这样，压根儿就不需要点名，也用不着总去催促学委一一核对了。
上课时间到了，扫一眼，截个图，考勤结果就出来了。
我有的时候会在快要上课时，把还没进会议室的同学名字直接截屏贴一下，作为提醒。

然后嘛，就像是有魔法，他们总是很快就进来了。
在我的 M1 芯片 Mac 上面，不知道什么原因，腾讯会议不支持以 mmhmm audio 作为声音输入来源，但是飞书会议从来没有遇到问题。我在授课时候利用 mmhmm 播放视频，飞书观众的效果总是清晰流畅。
上课过程中，我会让学生在飞书群里面 call 1 作为回答的顺序。这样问答有序，计分的同学也比较容易查看到原始记录。

课程开始之前，我都会开启视频录制功能。不需要占用本地空间，所有会议内容都自动上传到服务器，并且通过飞书妙记功能，自动转换成为文字版会议纪要，还能提取关键词等。

如果有必要的话，可以把妙记文档转换成为飞书文档，共享给因为特殊事项（例如统一测核酸…</span>

2021 年度征文中我介绍了我的装修经历和复盘，装修接近尾声，设备和家具都陆续进场。这次先带大家看看，我家厨房已经添置了哪些设备和好物。
自动增压泵
品牌型号：威乐 201EH
价格：780 元 + 200 元安装费
推荐度：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
厨房好物第一站，从自动增压泵开始说起。如果你家是老小区的高楼层，我非常建议你安装自动增压泵。像我家是 1996 年的建造的房子，楼层为 6 楼。前两年在租出去时，租客就反馈水压小，特别到了冬季进水压力不足，热水器会因水压过小无法正常使用。所以我装修初期，就已经计划安装自动增压泵。

选购有自动控制器的型号
增压泵的结构氛围两个部分，下部蓝绿色卧式离心泵（增压泵本体），上部接自动控制器。一定选择有自动控制器的版本，因为泵本体是不会自动关停的，接上电源它就会一直工作。有了自动控制器才能适用到我们的日常水龙头等用水需求。当有用水信号发出后，就会触发自动控制器，启动增压泵进行工作。结合房屋面积，我选择了功率较小的 201EH，目前感觉也足够日常生活使用。
相关 tips
不过，虽然是「低噪运行」，增压泵的声音还是无法忽略的，即使增加了泡沫垫，还是能听到噪声。噪声主要来自于机身震动与厨房柜体发生的共振。这也是我家目前室内噪声的主要来源。
威乐的价格波动较大，在同事的建议下，我在闲鱼平台交易的全新设备，支持联保。威乐的安装需要另外收费，即使是天猫淘宝也是如此。
另外，在增压泵的前面，我增加了前置过滤，主要可以起到去除入户自来水中，较大的金属碎屑等颗粒物，延长各用水终端设备的使用寿命。需要特别注意，…</span>
