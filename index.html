                    <span>In this article, we will learn how to change the Build path of a React application. Here I&#x27;m using a shell script for moving the contents inside the build folder to another location. 
Create a {file-name}.sh file inside the root directory of your react app. 


Open to your package.json file.


Just beneath the build script, add a new one called &quot;postbuild&quot; with a value &quot;./{file-name}.sh&quot;.




if you are using Windows, use bash before executing the script.

This shell script is executed right after the build process, and the actual magic happens inside the shell script.
#If the folder exists, remove it first, then copy the files
if [ -d &quot;./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/&quot; ]; then

    rm -rv ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/*
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/

#Else make a new folder and then move the files.
else
    mkdir -p ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/
fi


In my case, I just wanted to move the build folder contents to my server folder.
This script can be customized to your need. Just go through some simple shell-script tutorials. Here what is helping us is the &#x27;postbuild&#x27; script that will be automatically executed after the build command.
Happy Coding 🥳</span>

  What is Dev-Sec-Ops?


DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It&#x27;s an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.
It is a endless field. Here we only focus about Infra and DevOps level security. We will discuss on both OSS and Paid tools which we can implement on CICD pipeline to make secure.
The Centre for Internet Security (CIS) provides a standardized set of security benchmarks to identify and refine effective security measures for specific set of tools and technologies.

We&#x27;ll start from the installation of Python and cover mathematical operations, strings, user input, string operations, variables, and In place operators.
If you don&#x27;t know, this blog post and all other future posts in the Python series are part of  this Udemy course. Do check it out.
Before starting if you don&#x27;t have Python installed on your computer, install the latest version of Python 3 from their website and a corresponding IDE to code which we&#x27;ll use for writing big programs, you can either go with VS Code or Pycharm.
We&#x27;ll start with the basic Hello World program. So open your Python console and follow the article -

                    <span>A while back ⁣I decided that I wanted to automate the flow of blog posts to my email list (which is basically nobody right now by the way 😅).
I found that Mailchimp has a feature for automatically sending to an email list based on RSS feed updates on a website.
A RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized way.
RSS feeds are usually generated for you in website builders and other tools but since my site was built from scratch I needed to make my own.
Here is what I needed to do:





That was a fun, quick project to work on for a few hours and saved me an exponential amount of time in the future. 💪🏾

                    <span>Introduction


In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll be building a login authentication using React and FastApi. This will help show how we can use both packages for a login authentication process but before that, let&#x27;s take at React and also what FastApi is.
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous actions, as well as data validation, authentication, and interactive API documentation, all of which are powered by OpenAPI. It comes with exciting features like:
React is a user interface development library. It can construct full-stack apps by talking with a server/API and operates as an SPA (single page app) on the client. Because it is competent and directly equivalent to frameworks like Angular or Vue, React …</span>

                    <span>Today we will cover another important structural directive provided by the Angular Team - ngFor
ngFor
Lets see that in practice-
structural-directive-demo.component.ts file and add the below code -
itemsToBuy &#x3D; [&#x27;Pencil&#x27;, &#x27;Notebook&#x27;, &#x27;School bag&#x27;, &#x27;Eraser&#x27;];

and in component template file add the below code -

  {{ item }}


Now if you start the application and open localhost:4200 in the browser you would see the below output -

*ngFor&#x3D;&quot;let item of itemsToBuy&quot; 
&#x3D; operator.
itemsToBuy is the array we declared in the component TS file. We use the for-of syntax to loop through the array. Every item in the array is assigned to the variable item which is then printed in between div tag by using the {{item}}. The loop is auto incremented and moves to the next item until all the items are printed.
item variable holds a string value.
list of objects. 
A word of Caution
For example ngIf and ngFor at the same div element is not allowed.
That&#x27;s all about ngFor. Hope you enjoyed the post.
Cheers!!!

How is it that a little over 35000 java packages, amounting to 8% of the Maven Central Repository has been impacted due to the log4shell vulnerability. How is it that a vulnerability in a logging library could result in a CVSS score of 10[the highest it can go is 10]. This classic java logging library hitting mainstream feels so odd. Two different worlds that shouldn&#x27;t be meeting.
In this blog, let&#x27;s understand what is log4j and what exactly is this log4shell vulnerability and why it happened?

Apache Log4j is one of the most utilized logging library in the Java ecosystem. If you ever worked within a Java application, you&#x27;ve probably seen log4j in action. Log4j along with the basic log…</span>

There are three different ways we can install Linux Mint. Linux Mint installation methods are:
Install Linux Mint in VirtualBox on Windows like a regular desktop application.
We are using the Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon edition. However, the steps work for installing other versions of Mint and desktop types such as Xfce and MATE. The screenshot taken from the Linux Mint installation steps may look a little different, but the steps are the same.

本周话题：下一个内卷的行业
一年多以前，周刊讨论过，&quot;内卷&quot;这个词到底是什么意思？
当时的结论是，内卷的原义是&quot;向内发展&quot;，因为向外发展受到了阻碍，就开始向内部要效益。结果往往是恶性竞争，因为 蛋糕做不大了，大家只能争夺对方的份额。

一年过去了，内卷已经成了常见词。
很多行业早就出现了内卷，比如培训业、电商、视频、直播等等。这样的行业，都有一个共同点：市场没有扩张，利润没有增长，但是从业人员却越来越忙、越来越累，业务开展越来越难。
下一个内卷的行业，会是谁？
我也不卖关子，直接说吧，很可能是游戏业。

你可能不相信这个结论：游戏业非常赚钱，而且一直在高速增长，怎么会内卷呢？
我本来也不相信，但是上周发布的《2021年中国游戏产业报告》，公布了中国游戏市场的两个增长率：
销售收入增长 6.40%，达到2965亿。
游戏用户增长 0.22%，达到6.66亿。

这两个增长率都非常低。
销售收入虽然增长6.4%，但如果考虑到游戏业的投入，每年都在增加，就意味着，今年的行业利润没有增长，可能还有下跌。
更要命的是，用户总数只增长了0.22%。这是有史以来最低的增长率，以前每年游戏人口都要增长几千万，今年只增长了100多万，接近零增长了。

这就是说，国内的游戏用户可能已经到天花板了，市场饱和了。玩游戏的人口大概就是这个数量了，国内的游戏市场以后就没有增量用户了。
虽然游戏行业还是会成长，因为每个用户的游戏支出会增加。但是，一个行业…</span>

[电影] 雄狮少年

关键词：动画 / 喜剧 / 剧情
片长：104 分钟
观看渠道：院线上映中；豆瓣链接

终于有一部题材特别的国产动画了。

@一只索狗：第一次看到预告片的时候就关注到这部作品，主要是因为它特别的题材背景，是我们的传统文化舞狮，我也在心里默默感叹：「终于有人拍些除了西游、古代神话故事之外的题材了。」
剧情讲述了留守少年阿娟和好友阿猫、阿狗在退役狮王咸鱼强的培训下参加舞狮比赛，最终「咸鱼翻身」的故事，主旨就是追逐梦想和生活现实的矛盾冲突。努力、热血、感动这些剧情关键词听起来有些套路，但本片处理方式得当…</span>

                    <span>双旦将至，身边的朋友陆陆续续开始讨论起「该送什么礼物给家人 / 伴侣 / 朋友 / 宠物...」，而正当我为挑选礼物苦恼的时候，编辑 Tp 给我发了这篇选题，也为我提供了全新的送礼思路。
此前我对于乐高的印象，只有「购买套装回来自己拼」，以及它的英文名 LEGO 是来自于丹麦语「LEg GOdt」，意为「Play Well」，玩得开心。
而在仔细逛完坐落在广州正佳广场，全球最大的乐高品牌旗舰店之后，我不仅拥有了属于自己的「定制小人仔」，还发现了「自选拼搭颗粒」「马赛克像素画定制」等独特的玩法。在这篇文章中，我将以广州正佳广场的旗舰店为例，来聊聊我们逛乐高旗舰店时，除了买套装，我们还可以留意的东西，希望能为你的双旦礼物挑选补充一个有趣的选择～

定制小人仔
哪个乐高玩家不想拥有一个专属于自己的定制人仔呢？前段时间 Tp 在 新玩意 分享了自己定制的乐高人仔，身在广州的我，自然也不会错过可以在家门口定制人仔的机会。于是在和 Tp 约稿之后，我也终于拥有了一个独一无二的乐高人仔。

定制人仔的步骤很简单，主要有以下几步：
购买

在收银台购买乐高小人仔工厂套装。

以广州乐高旗舰店为例，想要定制一个属于自己的人仔，首先要到收银台购买一个乐高小人仔工厂套装，定价是 99 元 / 个。完成付款之后，工作人员会递给自己一个包装盒，拿着包装盒到定制台进行扫描就可以开始定制啦。如果你去的时候人比较多，可能需要先跟工作人员签到排号，并且可能会限制你的定制时间。

个性化定制

在小人仔工厂机器上扫描套装，输入你的姓名，开始设计吧。

将购买好的包装盒放在定制台上，屏幕会出现「输入你的姓名」的提示，系统内置中文输入法并支持中文混排。输入好名字之后会打印在一个 1x3 的砖块上，可以作为小人仔的站台。

开始定制之后，我们可以对小人仔上装的正反面进行设计，而头部、裤部…</span>

享乐
推荐好的游戏音乐，希望更多人因为音乐对游戏产生兴趣（我就是）。

                    <span>这是少数派与国民好物 aigo 联合推出的信息储存设备的科普系列文章。作为国内早期的存储设备制造商及佼佼者，感谢 aigo 对本文提供的一系列支持，包括但不限于技术知识指导、市场难寻的老物件以及作者用于拆解介绍的最新产品等。
我们希望通过最简洁通俗的描述，带领大家了解信息储存设备的基本原理，知道那些复杂的参数，如何挑选购买适合自己的存储设备，又是如何更好地使用，更安全稳定地保存我们的数据，以及未来我们能够用上什么技术。 另本系列虽然与 aigo 联合发起，但所有内容不涉及任何品牌指导或要求的商业营销。

上一章我们了解到了另一种特殊的储存介质，运行内存的方方面面，本章我们就继续来介绍除了机械硬盘和固态硬盘外，我们常用的一些储存设备，包括 U 盘、内存卡、移动硬盘和手机储存芯片。它们都是使用 NAND 颗粒来储存数据，并且有着相同的工作结构，不过形态和实际性能却截然不同。
U 盘的结构原理和常见参数
说完运行内存，接下来再说一个大家更加熟悉的东西 —— U 盘（很多人也叫它优盘）。从学生时代开始，这玩意儿估计是大部分人必备的一个东西，带着我们重要的文档（或许还有病毒~），流连在各个电脑的 USB 接口之间。比如底下这个超经典的金士顿 U 盘，应该都曾经拥有或者见过别人用这个吧：
经典的红色透明金士顿 Kingston U 盘，型号是 DT101G2
如果你年纪比较小，那经典的 U 盘应该换成这个：
新经典金属外壳金士顿 Kingston U 盘，型号是 DTSE9/DTSE9G2
也许现在大部分人用的还是好几年前的 U 盘，但其实除了我们印象中的那些经典 U 盘，现在的 U 盘已经发展得更加成熟，稳定性和速度都有了很大提升，还出现了新的品类。接下来我就给大家详细介绍一下 U 盘的结构原理和一些我们需要了解的参数。

                    <span>​年关将至，如果说回头看这一年联盟出现了什么变化，或许现在高居东部第五的骑士队会是个值得关注的惊喜。
虽然这么说有点马后炮，但这支球队自小比克斯塔夫接手之后就隐隐约约给人一种将要崛起的气质。
人们总喜欢从成功的结果往前倒推复盘，然后总结出各种各样的理由，但最后得出的结论往往既没有参考性也没有可复制性，因为球队的发展不是加减乘除的方程式，每一个做出影响的因素都不是固定的常量，变量太多的事情你怎么复制？
给骑士的成功总结原因其实没多大意思，比起事后吹捧他们怎样慧眼识珠凑到这套阵容，不如讨论一下他们现在到底强在哪里？
从数据上看，新赛季骑士最好的环节是防守：目前他们每百回合只丢103.5分，这个数字排在联盟第3，仅次于勇士和太阳两支胜率在80%以上的独一档球队。



而骑士防守出彩很大程度上与他们的三高体系有关。有趣的是，由于活塞曾经有不堪入目的三高失败案例，“德拉蒙德+约什-史密斯+门罗”攻不能守不行，所以骑士实施三高体系的初期并不被球迷看好。
这也很难说是球迷没有眼光，因为把阿伦+莫布里+马尔卡宁的组合冠以“三高“的标签存在一定的误导性。
虽然他们的身高都超过2米11，但良好的机动性使得他们不能与普通的内线的球员混为一谈。
实质上，骑士”三高“内核里藏着的是“小球”，三高确实是高，但他们却具备“小球时代”最强调的核心竞争力——防守的伸缩性。
阿伦谈到骑士的长人体系这样说：“也许球风回到2001年不是坏事”，但骑士看似古早的篮球哲学只是表象，踩准现代篮球获益点才是他们真正做成的事情。
尤其是阿伦作为三高体系的代言人，他或许是这个“反差萌”的最佳代表。为什么这么说？因为莫布里和马尔卡宁虽然都是7尺长人，但他们本身就在4-5号位摇摆，甚至能漂移到3号位的现代独角兽。而阿伦属于典型的传统护框型内线，但传统的外衣下却是反差极大的，适应小球时代的可塑性。

                    <span>能说总是好事，不管正派还是反派
by 乌合之子但愿君
☆本文包括对大量影视、动画作品的反派的剧透，请谨慎阅读。☆
反派死于话多，其实还有两句话，一句是主角胜于嘴炮，一句是主角死于不补刀。但是本文是讲反派的，所以关于主角的故事，等下次有机会我们再分析吧。
反派为什么死于话多呢？这句话到底是怎么来的呢？
本着打破砂锅问到底的精神，我进行了一番仔细的考证，发现了一个记入影视评论书的来源。美国影评达人罗杰·伊伯特（Roger Ebert）的书《我知道你们又来这一套》里收录了这个词条。

全文如下：
Fallacy of the Talking Killer。
The villain wants to kill the hero. He has him cornered at gunpoint. All he has to do is pull the trigger. But he always talks first. He explains the hero&#x27;s mistakes to him. Jeers. Laughs. And gives the hero time to think his way out of the situation, or be rescued by his buddy. Cf. most James Bond movies.[1]
反派死于话多之误。反派一直梦想杀掉主角。他已经用枪把主角逼到了墙角，只需轻轻一扣扳机就大功告成了；但他开始详细地阐述主角所犯的错误，然后嘲讽一番、冷笑几声。而所有这些嘴炮存在的意义就是为了让主角有充足的时间思考该如何逃生，或者成功地被同伴解救。007系列电影中的詹姆斯·邦德先生就是这种现象的受益者。
这本书里还收录了很多奇奇怪的词条，比如：

                    <span>你好，我是射手夸夸。
如果你想在游戏中掌控局势，那么请与我一起让更多ADC成为ADC吧。
笔者曾用烬（场数占比70%+）打上艾欧尼亚最强王者段位，也常使用烬上分。本篇为戏命师·烬的英雄攻略文章，其中内容涵盖英雄优劣势分析、版本解读、符文与装备选择、技能理解与分析、打法技巧以及对线不同ADC的一些经验。
烬在国服较为冷门，即便他往往能成为赛场中的宠儿、版本里的顶流。我相信烬能受到召唤师们的喜爱，于是我在去年8月份，通过图文、视频的形式，较为完整地创作了烬的英雄攻略，或许有朋友已在之前看过，不过不必担心，这篇文章在许多地方有了优化更新，也增添了一些内容。
射手夸夸：戏命师·烬！万字攻略教你玩好“艺术家”
相信会有更多人喜欢烬，也相信大家都能成为一名高手烬。
（此为11.2-11.3版本所作，而现在3月4日版本已更新，故有些地方与当下有别，除版本外不影响阅读，之后版本更新对烬有较大影响时，会将文字优化更新）
英雄优劣、版本、符文与装备

烬于2016年2月18日登场，成为召唤师峡谷的第129名英雄，登场第一年就拥有了冠军皮肤，SKT-T1-烬。
之前有朋友问我喜欢用哪个皮肤，哪个皮肤手感好，我个人推荐暗星尊，至于之后的新皮肤就需要用过才知道了。

许多玩家对他有一个身体上的误解，他其实不是瘸子，走路一瘸一拐是因为他把武器拆分放在身上，武器太重所以导致走路姿态异常，在开大的时候就会掏出并进行组装。
官方也说过烬是个健全的人，机械那半边只是护臂，是减轻枪后坐力用的，肩膀上突出来的一块是武器组件。当然一些玩家也已习惯称呼烬为瘸子了，我想他这个用枪当作画笔的艺术家不会在意。

我于杀戮之中盛放，一如黎明中的花朵。烬的魅力不仅源于台词和沈磊老师的配音，同时烬的名称戏命师以及各个技能和效果的名称也非常酷。

                    <span>No framework Vue, na sua atual versão 3, é possível utilizar a API de composição do Vue (Composition API) para lidar com possíveis cenários de repetição de código. 
Agora o Vue conta com funcionalidades importadas do framework, para ser utilizado somente aquilo que será necessário. A abordagem é um pouco parecida com os &quot;react hooks&quot; para quem vem do mundo do React.js.
Aqui vai um exemplo:
global.js
   import { reactive } from &#x27;vue&#x27;;

   const state &#x3D; reactive({ count: 0 })

   const incrementCount &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; state.count++;

   export default { state, incrementCount };

No código acima é importada uma função que vai lidar com a reatividade do objeto, que é passado como argumento contento o atributo &quot;count&quot;. Dessa forma qualquer alteração no atributo &quot;count&quot; será reativo, ou seja, qualquer lug…</span>

The element is completely removed from the DOM if the condition executes to false. It will not occupy any space in the DOM.

&#x3D; 18&quot;&gt;I am an Adult!
I am a CHILD
&#x3D; 18&quot;&gt;I am an Adult!
&#x3D; 18 returns true which is assigned to the directive ngIf. Since true is assigned to the directive ngIf the p tag is visible.
myAge variable value to say 17 so that the above condition is false but the second line of code 
I am a CHILD
 returns true.
Now if you open the browser you will see that the output changes.
p tag is not shown/ hidden while the second p tag is shown which was hidden when the model value was 18.

  checkAge() {
    if (this.myAge &gt;&#x3D; 18) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

and in html template file you can call the function inside ngIf like below -
I am an Adult!

Note
Any values like false, null, undefined, empty string when assigned to ngIf will result in hiding the element.
Hope you enjoyed the post.
Cheers!!!
Happy Coding</span>

                    <span>Disclaimer: I have created this tutorial on Mac and have used yarn because it is recommended by PWA Studio. 
In this blog i will tell you how to add react-gtm-module in your PWA Studio storefront project. So there are some steps which need to be followed.
Your must have a storefront project in pwa studio. You can also create a new one by using command yarn create @magento/pwa or npm init @magento/pwa. 
You must install Fooman VeniaUiOverrideResolver for PWA Studio either by using yarn add @fooman/venia-ui-override-resolver or by using npm i @fooman/venia-ui-override-resolver. The main reason behind installing Fooman extension is we need to override a component file where we will add our gtm module. For example if we want to add our gtm module in our main.js file then inside our src folder …</span>

                    <span>Introduction
It&#x27;s no secret that the job market is competitive. You need to stand out from the crowd in order to get noticed and nab an interview. But what if you&#x27;re struggling with where to start? What should you do? The answer lies in your side hustle!
A side hustle, or &quot;hustle&quot; for short, is any project or venture you take on outside of your day job (or night job) that provides supplemental income. It could be something as simple as making candles at home; it could also be a full-time business like running a bakery.
Hustling is the act of making money outside of your 9-5 job or business. Side hustles are usually small ventures that provide supplemental income, but they can also turn into full-time gigs
Either way, there are many ways for software developers to make money outside of thei…</span>

                    <span>Today we will learn about Optimize React Application Performance in this tutorial.
React.Js is an open-source JavaScript UI library for building user interfaces. Nowadays React is the most popular for frontend design. It’s especially used to building single-page applications. You can create large applications in React that can transform data without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is fast, scalable, and simple. Literally, React has the ability to use several clever technics to minimize costly DOM operations required to update the UI. But for some large applications, you need to optimize your React application performance. There are several ways to speed up your React applications, let’s learn about them -

Knowledge is power! 
Knowing what events have taken place in your Netlify project, and being able to trigger actions based on those events, is pretty bloomin’ powerful too!
Netlify creates a variety of events throughout the lifecycle of your site deployments and for other services we provide for your sites, such as form submissions. Each of these events can create notifications and trigger actions elsewhere.
Combining tools and services using events and triggers opens up all kinds of fun possibilities for your projects!

                    <span>How to UI?


Art of UI creation is so common I guess. Many people ignore the part of UI planning and directly hopes into HTML and CSS. What is fascinating is that planning and creating a design template is better as it allows you to check which font and colors suit your website and style, because it&#x27;s not easy to change theme of whole website once it&#x27;s somewhat or maybe completely built as compare to UI creation tools.

Using such tools like FIGMA and Adobe XD allows us to quickly do those changes and finalize the design, all then is left to implement them in real-time website.
*1. Icons *
https://www.flaticon.com/ that I personally use when it comes to icons and small vectors to aid website looks.

2. Theme and colors
https://flatuicolors.com/ as it provides best colors and combos that are so perfect when actually implemented. It&#x27;s easy and free to use :)

3. Images
https://unsplash.com/ although you might already know about it. But something that you might not be knowing is that they also provide users with an API that provide aesthetic images by artists for you to implement in your source code.

4. Fonts. YES! please
https://fonts.google.com/ or https://fontawesome.com/ (font awesome provides icons as well).

Hope all this was useful to you and I hope you&#x27;ll apply these in your projects so they would look even more attractive.

First of all: I love frontend development. It is the direct touchpoint to the user for websites / -apps. It is the first impression for the user.
There is so much out there. It can be paralyzing. I already used a variety of frontend frameworks: React (CRA, Gatsby, NextJS), Vue, Angular, Svelte (SvelteKit). And as far as styling goes, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things too: CSS (modules), SASS, CSS-in-JS, Material, Bootstrap, Bulma, Quasar, Tailwind…</span>

@北鸮：Paperwill 2022 纸志地球模型台历

购买渠道：天猫
入手价格：168 元

2022 年眼看就到了，最近几天一直盘算着买个日历。原本是想整个台历，记点儿每天的什么重大事件的，后来想想好像有手机有手帐，我也没什么再整个记事台历的必要，于是就奔着桌面摆件的方向去找。原本是相中了即刻出的那款「今天是周五吗」，但当我看到的时候，它就早早卖空了。
本着达成「桌面摆件」和「每天撕一页的仪式感」两个原则，我最终入手了这款 Paperwill 出产的「纸志地球」。

就我的理解，本质上这应该是借鉴日本 TRIAD Inc. 几年前大火的 OMOSHIROI BLOCK 纸雕便签系列。当时那款纸雕便签从边缘一层层揭下逐渐露出京都清水寺的设计让人眼前一亮。稍有差别的是纸志地球由于纸雕最终成球形，是以中心为轴，日历纸做成三角，旋转排布，逐渐露出地球的纸雕。

这个日历还配备一个亚克力罩子，撕完扣上可以直接当成展示盒。扯下来的纸张其实也可以当成小便签贴在显示器下面。很显然，它唯一的实用价值就是一眼看明白今天是几号。对我来说，它最大的作用就是好看，早起撕一页开始新一天，神清气爽。
由于我没有那个上来就把所有日历就撕掉直接看纸雕的魄力，而且还想看看露到一半的地球是个什么样子，这里就只能把店铺的成品图搬过来了。纸雕看起来还是比较细腻的，大尺度的海拔变化也有体现，想想一年后我就能有一个可爱的纸雕地球摆件，还是有点期待的。

                    <span>在上一篇油猴脚本使用指南中，我为大家简单介绍了用户脚本的前世今生，以及用户脚本的一些能力介绍。在这一篇中，我将就两个主要话题继续分享一下：一个是移动端浏览器使用用户脚本，另一个则是一些脚本的推荐。

移动端浏览器使用用户脚本
想要在移动端浏览器使用用户脚本，我们一般而言有两类选择：一是使用支持扩展插件的浏览器，通过安装扩展插件（如 Tampermonkey）来支持用户脚本；而如果浏览器不支持扩展插件，则可以直接支持用户脚本。
下面我也按照这两大类别简单介绍一下。
支持扩展插件的移动端浏览器
这里本来想展开写一下，但是发现 jijiali 和克莱德珠玉在先，已经写了这篇文章。我这里就不展开写了，仅作为省流助手，列几款常见的支持扩展插件的移动端浏览器。

Firefox：使用 Firefox 应用商店，使用自己的 Gecko 浏览器核心
Yandex：来自俄罗斯的应用，使用 Chrome 应用商店
Kiwi Browser：基于Chromium 核心，使用 Chrome 应用商店
神马浏览器（Sleipnir Mobile）：使用自己的应用商店

此外，最近还有这个浏览器值得一看——Iceraven：基于火狐同款的 Gecko 内核开发，支持扩展程序（Firefox 应用商店），如果你下载 Iceraven 会发现这两个界面几乎都一样，甚至 Iceraven 还支持火狐账户同步。

题外话：你可能会纳闷，Iceraven 和 Firefox 有什么区别呢？

根据 Iceraven 自己的 介绍，它有两个核心的区别：

Iceraven 可以访问 about:config 页面来做一些修改和调整
Firefox 只限制了部分附加组件在 Android 端使用，Iceraven 支持更多的附加组件。

                    <span>上次谈练字这件事已经是 四年前 了。彼时我并没有想到，未来的生活会和手里的纸笔越来越远。尤其是成功读研后，我的生活就和纸笔完全断了联系。脱离了需要一直手画重点的医学课本，电子版文献的数量剧增让我不得不告别此前什么资料都要打印出来的习惯，再一步步进化到完全在 iPad 上批注、听讲、做笔记，直到毕业了开始工作了，我手里还是有一大把没用完的墨水和笔芯。
这还只是摆在我桌面上的一部分
重提练字这件事，开始于前几天和因为钢笔认识的朋友聊天之后。他的工作内容比较传统，每天需要大量开会，几乎随时与纸笔为伴，随手写的笔记也字字有形——拉马克的「用进废退」理论用来直接解释进化论非常扯淡，映照在个体的生活中反而十分合理。如同缺乏日常使用的我几乎把本就不多的数学知识忘了个精光，等我尝试去好好写几个字，才发现握了笔，我的手都有点抖。
肌肉记忆也是需要唤醒的。我尝试着寻找了新的工具与合适的方法，重启我的练字之路。这篇文章我将主要从几个常常讨论到的问题出发，聊一聊现在还想练字的我们可能会考虑到、会发出疑惑的细节。
我能用平板和手机练字吗？
先说结论：不能。其原因和 这篇 英文书法入门指南中提到的类似。
或许你在各种社交平台见过那些在 iPad 上创作各种养眼的手写作品的影像，请记住，这些作者绝对不是在 iPad 上练好字才发出来的，而是先前已经有了写字的底子。iPad 对于会写字的人来说是一个只需要简单熟悉的新工具，而对于「不会写字」需要练字的我们来说，它并不是一个好的起点。
对于起源于象形符号，且正统书法审美来源于软笔书法的中文来说，即使在已经广泛使用硬笔作为书写工具的现在，想要更快抓住中文书写的要领，还是应当采用能够明确给予物理反馈的纸笔。如果以之前西文书法探讨的内容作为类比，中文书法，即使在使用硬笔时，也时时刻刻在采用基于「点尖」的书法技巧。如果你去观察一个正经现代书法家书写的钢笔字帖，就会发…</span>

因为我喜欢时常记录自己的生活，除了一堆所思所想的文字内容外，照片应用里也记录下了这几年的点点滴滴。除了偶尔怀旧，我也不会盯着相册的日日累积，只是任由相册占用的 iCloud 空间扩充着。
直到有一天，听到朋友为几万张照片的整理和去留烦恼时，翻看手机才意识到我的照片也已经超过了一万张。我决定给自己的相册瘦个身，主要是为了保证自己能够在海量的照片中快速定位到想找的内容，毕竟在此之前我就已经经历过很多次照片翻找不到的情况。但整理照片这件事情，我不需要一劳永逸，我更喜欢细水长流，有空的时候能够整理一下其实就足够了。
翻找应用，意外中意上国货「减法相册」
比起纯手动的 Slidebox，Cleanup 和 Gemini 的设计显然更得我心，但仅仅增加了重复照片这项功能就收价不斐，让我有些犹豫。近些年来，国人开发者的声量逐渐提升，照片处理领域就没有好的作品吗？
减法相册简洁的首页
答案显然是不，很快我就在社交平台上发现了「减法相册」这款应用，即使才发布了第一个正式版本，功能值得说道的同时颜值过关，可以说是质量不错的「国货应用」了。
减法相册看到了「随手」整理的需求
不是所有人的照片都会规规矩矩地拍好，修好，传到社交网站、社区平台的，大多数人是像我一样，拍完即走，偶尔修修，看心情发送的普通人。但这并不意味着普通人没有整理的需求，相反，普通人的相册更加需要整理，减法相册找到了这群人对于整理的不同层次的需求，也恰好匹配了我的想法。
我对于照片整理的首要需求是，能够让我以时间的维度纵观整体相册待整理内容，同时「细嚼咽慢」地整理相册，边看边回味边整理。…</span>

Since then the site grew to be one of the premier programming help sites on the internet in the mid-2000&#x27;s being the #1 site on google for dozens of &quot;[Language] Help&quot; and &quot;Programming Help&quot; searches with millions of visitors a month. We&#x27;ve had an incredible team of moderator and admins over the years that have kept the site clean, organized, and helped with thousands and thousands of questions. 



Dream.In.Code was originally just me learning how to install a forum and it turned in to a thriving community. Over the years, other sites have grown and changes in search rankings have seen traffic decline which also means advertising...

                    <span>本文由西甲官方提供合作支持，首发 @体育产业生态圈 


前些天，一位西甲联盟的工作人员突然给我发了条消息：“有没有兴趣写篇文章，聊聊我们上赛季是如何帮助格拉纳达击败巴萨的？”
我当即愣在了原地，用不停颤抖的手指做出了回复：“这个……真的是能放到台面上讲的事情吗？”
等到对方发来一大堆资料和视频的时候，我才焕然大悟。原来故事是这样的：格拉纳达教练团队的分析师阿尔瓦罗-加西亚近期谈到了球队回到西甲后这两个赛季的成功里，数据分析起到了至关重要的作用。更神奇的是，他们的数据分析系统并不是俱乐部自己搭建的，而是西甲联盟对所有西甲和西乙球队免费开放的平台Mediacoach。
作为例子，他重点提到的就是今年四月格拉纳达客场2-1击败巴萨的那场比赛。


【那场比赛里发生了什么？】
已经过去了8个月的时间，可能不少球迷已经不太有印象了，所以咱们先简单回顾一下剧情：巴萨当时与皇马、马竞之间的西甲冠军竞争日趋白热化，那场比赛他们也牢牢掌握了控球权。上半场各种围攻并且由梅西打进一球，但下半场被马奇斯和莫里纳连入两球逆转。
那是格拉纳达队史首次在诺坎普击败巴萨，之前他们在这里的成绩惨到25场全败，连一分都没有拿到过。也是因为这场爆冷输球，巴萨错过了登顶积分榜首的绝佳机会，后来丢掉心气率先退出了冠军争夺。

那么问题来了，这场比赛和那个叫Mediacoach的数据平台有什么关系呢？
再来简单科普一下这个平台，这是由西甲联盟开发的数据分析可视化系统，通过架设在西甲和西乙42队主场的高速摄像头来采取每场比赛里的专业数据，最终形成一个庞大的数据库系统和大量自动生成的报告。
重点来了：这个平台对每一家俱乐部都完全开放，免费、没有VIP和白金会员，甚至还不停呼吁你们赶紧来白嫖。

有的俱乐部坚信天下没有白吃的午餐，本身也不怎么把数据分析当回事，但也有人产生了浓厚的兴趣，比如格拉纳达。系统上线时，这家来自安…</span>

Jesus said to love one another and that we should be servants to each other, so I would ask that you all do that in the comment section. Be respectful. We are a community. That means more to me than anything. Thank you.

                    <span>Is it even possible for 2 people to fully repopulate the Earth? According to Adam and Eve, it is, but there are some serious dangers of inbreeding that could kill off the next generation before they even get started. Don&#x27;t miss today&#x27;s new experiment to find out if the Bible creation story could actually be true.

                    <span>Since I moved out here, my goal was to get the rest of my family out here with me. I was scared of how long it would take, if I&#x27;d have enough money to help, what the process was going to be like, pero mira! A little over a year, both my sister and I finally did it!!! We couldn&#x27;t have done it without the help of our realtors Monica and Laura @ realtor_monicasinger ! Im so thankful for this and couldn&#x27;t have done it without you perras either!! In this video we surprise my parents with the home and get their reaction!

                    <span>Companies that do business in the native language of their customer build better customer relationships. Although this may seem fairly obvious, it&#x27;s easier said than done.
After all, when your customer base is spread around the world, how do you scale your customer service?
Unbabel has built their business around the idea that customer service can be delivered in any language quickly and efficiently with the right blend of AI and human intelligence, creating a platform they call &quot;Language Operations&quot; or LangOps.
Jonathan Sowler, VP of Engineering at Unbabel, joins Dev Interrupted to talk about machine learning, what it takes to build a product that seamlessly integrates AI and human-powered translations, and why the future of language involves emojis.
Dan and Jonathan also rundown LinearB metrics and why Jonathan believes implementing LinearB has improved the health of Unbabel&#x27;s engineering team.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



What is LangOps?
How ML can be applied to different brands
Unbabel&#x27;s use of WorkerB

Why Unbabel chose to implement LinearB metrics

Building a platform that integrates AI &amp; human intelligence

Jupyter emerged and gained respect for being an easy-to-install solution, in addition to bringing the proposed use to facilitate coding and visualization of the code, a form of interactive computing aimed at usability. With the success of Python, other market tools started to support this language and compete directly with Jupyter.
Now that I spoke well about jupyter, let’s go to the competition… :)

The company Jetbrains developed Pycharm, a Python development solution containing a development wizard, support for Django, Flask, Google App Engine, Pyramid, and web2py web frameworks, support for other languages ​​such as JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Cython, SQL, HTML / CSS, template languages, AngularJS, Node.js, test and debugg…</span>

This post is a list of extensions and themes for Microsoft Visual Studio Code that I’ve used and recommend.
About VS Code
Visual Studio Code is an open-source editor developed and maintained by Microsoft, one of the most used and popular editors at the moment. Its popularity is mainly:
Possibility of “debug” by the editor.


Integration with GIT.


Lots of cloud integrations like Azure and GCP.


Possible to use with DevOps solutions such as Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes.


Having supported Windows, Linux, and Mac.


It supports the possibility of development for several languages like C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, and runtimes like .NET and Unity.

                    <span>React.memo() is one of those things that should be a part of every React developer&#x27;s arsenal. It gives us the ability to memoize a React component. As with any tool, before we delve into how to use React.memo(), let&#x27;s understand the problem first.
Memoization is a general concept which basically means caching the results of some kind of computation for later use. It is an optimization technique which is used quite extensively in the programming world.
An important point to remember is that whenever memoization is used, there must be a criteria which would dicate when the cached results are no longer valid and the computation must be done again.
To understand the problem this solves, consider the following React component:
import { useState, Fragment } from &quot;react&quot;;

                    <span>This blog was originally published on CodeCast.
To a lot of people, a new year means new potential. It feels like a fresh start and the drive to make changes and do well is at an all-time high. A lot of that is because after the madness of the holidays and reflecting on the year behind us, we’re able to take a slight break before going back into our routine - and often, we’d like that routine to change.
Resolutions are nothing new. They have been around for a very long time and even though a lot of people make resolutions they end up breaking, the idea behind the resolution is what we find important.
Striving to grow and change and be a better version of ourselves is something we should all be doing throughout our entire lives. It keeps everyone constantly moving forward and adapting, and …</span>

                    <span>Pytube is a great little Python utility for downloading videos from youtube as .mp4 files. It has a command-line interface that makes downloading videos as simple as entering the following command:
$ pytube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;....

Replace the URL with the Youtube URL of the video you want to download.
To make things even easier, I wrote a shellmarks wrapper script for this that provides an intuitive GUI form.

Simply paste in the URL and press “Download”, and it will download the video to your “Downloads” directory.
Pytube installation instructions can be found here.
The TLDR of the install instructions, if you have Python 3 already installed, is to open Terminal and enter:
$ pip install pytube

If pip happens to be the python2 version, you can try

                    <span>This is my first blogpost ever, and I never actually thought I would write one. Remix.run is the root cause, because it got me so  excited that I could not resist. Let me explain!
I started programming for the web in the days of ASP (Active server pages). It was done using Visual Basic syntax so it was very basic. The form post to server and response was simple even though we didn&#x27;t do the fancy Javascript stuff we are doing today. 
Netscape navigator was the ruler among browsers then.
Lately I&#x27;ve been doing fontend with GWT and now React for the last couple of years. I love React but doing form, collecting server state and keeping state in sync on the client has been very challenging. I&#x27;ve used Redux, Jotai, Cerebral JS, Overmind JS (favorite) to name a few state libraries.

There are many different types of visualizations, but one popular type is a chart or graph that displays information in the form of symbols, shapes, colors etc. 
Data visualization libraries can make this process easier for you by providing tools and functions for creating charts and graphs from your dataset. 
In this blog post, we will discuss five interesting Python data visualization libraries which should provide you with some inspiration when it comes to building your next project!

                    <span>Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)


The nullish coalescing operator is amazing when working with possibly undefined data.
// returns &#x27;default value&#x27;
null ?? &#x27;default value&#x27;

This operator can be used to define a default value for possibly nullish data, avoiding verbose code checking if some data is not defined.
// if &#x27;name&#x27; is not defined,
// we pass a default string into our function.
customFunc(name ?? &#x27;default&#x27;)

A lot of people think this is what the OR (||) operator does.
falsy, not just nullish. This includes data such as 0 and &#x27;&#x27;.
Using optional chaining, when accessing properties, if any property reference is nullish, the expression returns undefined instead of causing an error.
const object &#x3D; {
  property1: {
    name: &#x27;P1&#x27;
  }
}

Refresh 周报编辑部：每当出现各种 CES 新品预热以及「年度**回顾」时，这一年就真的马上要结束了。

🟦 Material Design Award 2021

经过了多年的演进与迭代，Material Design 如今也已不再局限于简单的 Android 应用 UI 设计指南那样简单。为了启发更多开发者在 Material Design 现有的基础上进行创新、同时适应随时代变化的应用设计需求，Material Design 官方设计团队每年都会根据不同的设计准则来为评奖，借此鼓励在 Material Design 设计领域作出创新的 App —— 这一奖项即是 Material Design Award。
今年临近尾声，Material Design Award 2021 的评选也已经出炉。

由于稍早之前我们已经在少数派发布了关于的此次评选的专题文章，所以在本期周报中仅作相对简单的补充说明。虽然今年 MD Award 以暗色主题、大屏版本适配、动效设计而非 Android 12 中的 Material You 为评选参考这一标准略显奇怪，但更奇怪的其实一直是 Google 评选这些年度 App 的标准：今年上榜的三款除了 Post-it 与 Todoist 都是相对老生常谈的工具类 App 之外，另一个因暗色模式适配而上榜的 Meetly 更是一款在 Play 商店中不温不火的视频会议应用。

这些应用的能够被评选出…</span>

                    <span>无论是 Windows、macOS、Linux 还是在其他更小众的操作系统当中，文件管理器一定是最为常见也最为常用软件之一。
而在 Windows 平台，从古早时代的「我的电脑」到 Windows 7 的「计算机」，再到 Windows 10 时代的「此电脑」，Windows 资源管理器经过多年的更新和开发后已经拥有了较为完善的功能。随着 Windows 11 的发布，微软为资源管理器带来了一套全新的设计语言，但不少人所期待的标签页、文件标签、更好用的文件预览等特性依然缺席，也难免引来「换汤不换药」的质疑。
如果你和我一样对 Windows 资源管理器有着更多的需求，不妨来看看这款既有颜值、功能又十分强大的第三方文件资源管理应用 —— Files。

优雅是它给人的第一印象
与 Windows 原生的文件资源管理器相比，Files 进行了不少的界面优化。作为更加「现代」的文件管理器，它引入了大量的微软流畅设计语言，界面元素之间的间距更加舒适，还去掉了不少系统文件管理器中残留的过时设计。
与此同时，Files 依然严格遵循并跟进了 Windows 11 的最新特性，包括新的上下文菜单交互逻辑和最新的 API 接口。在这些特性的加持下，Files 颜值更高的同时也有着非常纯正的「原生味儿」。
例如，左侧原生的文件资源管理器中，鼠标移到图标上还会有 Windows 7 时代残留的蓝色选中框，而 Files 已经全面采用 Windows 11 的设计语言
不过要说二者在 UI 上最大的不同，还是对地址栏、搜索栏和快速操作栏的 UI 调整。在 Files 中，文件夹的定位按钮、地址栏和搜索栏的层级显然是更高的，针对具体文件的操作按钮和浏览方式按钮则下放到了与文件浏览界面的同一层级。个人认为，从逻辑上来说这样的布局方式是更加符合文件管理直觉的，操作时也能带来更强的条理感。
上：原生文件…</span>

                    <span>我等了三年，就是要等一个机会，我要争一口气，不是证明我了不起，我是要告诉大家，我曾经失去的我一定要拿回来。

2021 年 10 月 28 日晚八点，尼康新品发布会。我正在上课，所以没有机会认真看完发布会的全部内容。但是当我看到开始铺天盖地在网上转发的尼康 z9 的信息后，心里面属实有点感慨。我慢慢地靠在椅子后背上，缓缓地舒了一口气。
千呼万唤的 Z9 终于来了（来自尼康官网）
小马哥等了三年，但是尼康等待了可远不止三年。这个曾经的巨人，在数据相机时代的冲击下一直显得有点力不从心，踉踉跄跄地想要站稳脚跟。作为一个消费者，和一个对尼康品牌有着特殊感情的人，他的努力我都看在眼里。但是我心里也清楚，在市场上，光有情感的支持并不能解决什么问题，尼康的产品一直给我一种想要努力赶上相机界一流水平的愿望，但是每次都差那么一点，差距还越来越大。甚至曾经有一段时间「尼康倒闭了吗」作为一个半调侃半认真的消息在中国互联网上疯传。

其实联想起它曾经的辉煌历史，和现在的对比往往会更加心酸。他曾经用自己高超的光学设计和先进的相机性能，谱写了相机界一个又一个近乎传奇的故事。对老用户近乎宠溺的照顾，既是口口相传的佳话，又是自缚的囚笼。
想要了解尼康的现在，就得了解他的过往。让我们先把时间拨回过去，回到100年前吧。
诞生在硝烟中
尼康的诞生与战争密不可分。1917 年，也许是因为在第一次世界大战预想到日后的战争需求，日本军方在军事仪器领域大力推进国产化。受此影响，东京测量仪器制造厂（東京計器製作所）的光学部门与岩城玻璃制造厂（岩城硝子製造所）的反射镜部门，在三菱集团（当时还称为三菱合資会社）社长岩崎小弥太的出资支持下集成，设立了日本光学工业股份公司（日本光學工業株式會社）。

想自己拍个视频、录个 Vlog，没人帮忙盯着构图，那就买一个无线图传？相机图传、监视器，少则几百，多则几千，对于业余玩家或者是刚入门的 UP 主来说，是一笔不小且非必要的支出。我们可以利用相机自带的 app，或者是第三方的附件、app，将我们的手机变成相机的监视器，方便在拍摄视频时进行构图。
使用相机自带的 App 连接
佳能、尼康、索尼、富士、松下 等品牌都为自家的相机提供了无线控制功能，只要手中的相机有蓝牙与 Wi-Fi 连接功能，即可在手机与相机配对后进行操控。
索尼 Imaging Edge Mobile
以索尼相机的 Imaging Edge Mobile 为例，打开相机的「智能遥控」app，使用手机或平板连接到相机的 Wi-Fi 热点后打开 Imaging Edge Mobile，点击「开始」或「连接新拍摄装置」，等待 app 自动连接。
但大部分入门级乃至中档的相机，内置的 Wi-Fi 都仅支持 2.4GHz 频段，信号功率并不算强，当距离稍远或周围的信号干扰一强，乃至转个身走远几步，就会出现卡顿、断连的问题，着实让人头大。（在这里点名批评索尼）
利用采集卡输入视频信号到手机
采集卡这种方法比较特别，通过相机的 HDMI 接口输出视频信号，经由视频采集卡借助 UVC 协议（USB video device class，支持 UVC 协议的数码设备可以在不安装驱动的情况下直接使用，实现免驱）输入到 Android 设备中，目前仅使用于支持 OTG 功能的 Android 手机，如果手机或平板支持 HDMI 信号直接输入…</span>

                    <span>谢邀~2021年从河西走廊到甘南，我有爱上甘肃的一万种理由~



【爱上甘肃的一万种可能】
我曾经想过一万种爱上甘肃的可能
却唯独忘记了它骨子里的桀骜不驯


在多年以后
只是见到它的一瞬间
我变沉沦了
——【小纪】自驾外星谷






【初识】
当初去兰州也只是匆匆一面，我甚至忘记曾经去过两次这件事，只是依稀记得当年上大学，坐着火车躺在卧铺上就出发了，沿途从夏天到冬天，绿色变成黄土坡，偶尔还有雪山。
后来我穿着破洞裤站在兰州站，寒风飕飕的往里刮，瑟瑟发抖。


【我怀念的】
从甘肃回来的半个月里，我一直都不能忘记旅途中的那种感受，从惊喜、到震撼、再到敬畏，怀念至今。
七彩丹霞，中国的大地彩虹。





外星谷，穿越宇宙吧！必去！必去！必去！！！






冰沟丹霞，被低估的嶙峋美





平山湖大峡谷，“媲美克罗拉多大峡谷”





甘加秘境，我大概会永远记得见到它第一面的震撼，庞然大物般的白石崖垂直在面前。









【自驾行程表】
Day1：落地张掖
Day2：张掖—七彩丹霞—冰沟丹霞；自驾约300km
Day3：外星谷—平山湖大峡谷—山丹军马场；自驾约327km
Day4：山丹军马场骑马—骊轩古城—武威；自驾约268km
Day5：天梯山石窟—永泰古城—兰州；自驾约400km
Day6：兰州—米拉日巴佛阁——尕秀村—郭莽湿地—郎木寺；自驾约350km
Day7：郎木寺—扎尕那；自驾约2650km
Day8：桑科草原—拉卜楞寺—甘家秘境；自驾约160km
Day9：甘家秘境—兰州（返程）；自驾约340km


【交通】
——飞机：去程是北京飞张掖；返程是兰州飞北京
——自驾：中途全程自驾，我们开的是理想ONE，好多人问我担心电车充电不方便，也担心不能跑西北。但其实理想ONE油电混合，可以跑880km左右。
在市区充满电就行，加油站也挺多。颠簸感很低…</span>

I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube for the Beem Team. I&#x27;ve built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob&#x27;s house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I&#x27;ve never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can&#x27;t wait for you to see what is next. 

If you’re reading this you’re a real one! 
Comment “Fortnite Chapter 3!&quot; so I can notice you!

Not Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

Alright so in this video I made some custom minecraft bosses and got a real mod developer to react to/review my designs. I ended up making bosses for the amethyst geodes, mountains, and nether biomes. They turned out really good! Sorry this video took so long to come out, we&#x27;re working on some big things! My mental health is on an unbelievably sharp decline, so I don’t know when I will be back, but I love making videos so I won’t be gone forever

                    <span>This was very emotional for me and my family. We flew in from Hawaii to surprise our family in Missouri with the exciting news!! They had absolutely no idea we were coming. They thought we couldn&#x27;t make it to Thanksgiving, but we figured out their plans and showed up anyway. Telling them was one of the most fun things we have ever done!

iOS「辅助功能」里你可能不知道的那些小技巧

🔋 充电量：98
作者：JLDUAN

大家是否还记得，在那个 iPhone 操作依赖 Home 键的时代，有些朋友为了延长 Home 按键的寿命，特意打开了辅助设置中的 AssistiveTouch 。随着 iPhone 交互与设计的不断进化，带 Home 键的 iPhone 已经逐渐被全面屏 iPhone 所取代。
时至今日，已经很少再见到有人启用 AssistiveTouch 了。除了 AssistiveTouch 之外，辅助功能里还隐藏着这些有趣的小功能，值得大家一试。

编辑荐语（Tp）：对于 iOS 用户而言，「辅助功能」就像金银岛一样，有着许多「宝藏」却鲜为人知。尽管辅助功能最初的目的是为了方便特殊群体使用 iPhone，但其中的不少功能对于大众而言也具有实用价值。作者在这篇文章中为我们搜集了 8 个值得一试的功能，从「广为人知」的轻点背面到系统级白噪音，这些功能总会让作为 iOS 用户的你发现新天地。
其中的引导式访问虽然是从非常早期的 iOS 版本就已经存在，但它依然是许多人未能搞懂的功能。它除了能防止他人在用你手机时瞎划乱动，还可以帮你更好地…</span>

这样画思维导图最有用
 
辛辛苦苦工作一年，工作又多又杂，但在写年终总结时，偏偏又感觉总是没办法一一写到？如果能用思维导图来梳理工作成绩，一定能让你的年终总结显得有条理，又详细。
通过思维导图，我们可以快速厘清思路，或者发散自己的想法。但是你有没有想过，在绘制思维导图的时候采用的方法都是正确的吗？很多人在绘制思维导图的时候都有着这样或那样的误区，如果能够注意到这些问题，就可以让思维导图更好地发挥作用。
作者 @Megabits 结合个人的学习和实践总结出一套优秀的思维导图利用方案，编写了《这样画思维导图最有用》系列教程。希望可以让更多人用对思维导图这样一个有趣又有效的思维工具。

                    <span>今年国庆期间，我上线了一款用来记录性生活的 App —— Aphrodite，除了因为切中目标用户的需求痛点而获得夸赞之外，我被问到最多的问题就是「为什么要开发这样一款应用」，以及「记录性生活有什么意义？为什么要记录？」。
在我已知的大部分人的观念里，「性生活」都是足够隐秘甚至禁忌的话题，相应地，「记录性生活」也被认为是荒唐之举，因此在 Aphrodite 上线后，我在社媒上照例去「吹嘘」的时候，收获更多的是来自于朋友们的质疑与不理解…… 这也是我写这篇文章的初衷之一，我想聊聊开发 Aphrodite 背后的故事，以及我所理解的「记录性生活的意义」。
关联阅读：派评 | 近期值得关注的 App
Aphrodite 背后的故事
在 Aphrodite 之前，我一直使用 iPhone 自带的健康应用来记录我的性生活，通过快捷指令它可以很便捷地记录性生活发生的时间及是否使用保护措施，但也仅限于此。我用了什么姿势、在哪里发生、时长、是否使用道具等等，一次性生活中值得被记录下来的参数有太多太多，iPhone 自带的健康应用完全无法满足我的需求。而当我尝试在 App Store 搜索后却失望地发现，整个应用商店的几百万 App 里，在做这件事儿的只有寥寥几款 App。
Aphrodite 提供详细的记录功能，甚至贴心地准备了「自慰记录」
在一切都数字化的今天，记录饮水、记录运动的 App 比比皆是，甚至记录排便也可以在 App Store 搜到一长串结果，但同样作为与身体健康密切相关、成人生活中必不可少的重要组成部分，性生活记录的相关应用却少得可怜——这是不合理的。
尽管在立项之初就认识到这一定是一个很小众的 App，甚至能否过审都是未知（后来在提审时确实也经历了各种坎坷），但无论是从自己的需求出发还是本着作为产品经理「想要做一些有意义的产品」的初心，我都不得不把它做出来。
这是我开发…</span>

前言
关于圣诞，我一直有许多想象，冰岛就是这些想象之中的耶路撒冷。
两年前的今天，我刚刚适应了异国读书的生活，眼看着迎来第一个圣诞长假，思来想去还是决定把目的地设在冰岛。和女友商量一番并试图拉来更多伙伴同行未果后，我们最终决定两人一车自驾游玩。一方面是来读书前开过一段时间车，手还没太生，另一方面觉得不自驾或许会辜负了美景。两年之后回忆起来，这着实是个疯狂而又值得的决定。
因为各种原因，当下出境游玩对大家来说都变得越来越不好实现。也因此，这段冰岛自驾的经历也在我心里愈发闪光。虽然行前做了完备的计划，但我一直没有从头到尾地总结过此事，只零散地发过 一些照片。借着又到圣（re）诞（du），这次好好回顾一下这个近期很难再有的经历。
这篇的属性更接近于攻略而非游记。事实上，少数派上能搜到许多自驾相关内容，@老麦 半年前还非常系统地分享了 西南自驾之旅，特别好特别推荐。这些内容在我整理本篇时帮助都非常大，推荐大家去看看的同时，也感谢各位的分享。
想写这篇的原因也在于，看了这些我发现自己的经验和各位还是有很多不重叠的部分，我也会更侧重地写这些不重叠的、针对冰岛冬季自驾的部分，或许也可以覆盖一些冬季在国内东北、西北的自驾场景。
在读之前，我希望你在脑中能对冰岛冬季自驾有一个大概的轮廓：

冰岛是左舵右行，高速公路只有双向两车道；
城镇密度低，没有太多像样的休息区；
圣诞节前后每天日照时间少于五小时；
冬季海风非常非常大，「风暴」很常见；
天气阴晴不定，雨雪后路面非常滑，时常封路；
……

可能这份攻略你一时半会都还用不上，但我们总有下一个冬天。

【1】
“公主，快起身吧，再晚就要挨训了。”小寅子急得已经半个身子踏出门槛，回首大声催促着。
“急什么，这就快了。太后最宠我们公主了，多晚也不打紧。”阙儿一边说着，脚下左半步右半步来回踱着，仔细检查我的妆容。
半晌，待阙儿终于满意了，对着镜子里的我说，“我们公主真真儿是娇俏明艳，今儿晚定能艳杀四方。”
我扑哧一声笑了出来。
皇宫里就我一个公主，这是要艳过母后呢，还是压一头皇祖母？


到了宫宴上，太后看我慈笑道，“婉扬来啦，你今天可是来晚了，元辰刚闹着要挨着本宫坐，把你的玉案抢去了呢。”
我朝上看去，那本来是我专属的青玉案上果然坐着元辰那个小矮子。他刚准备用小肉手去够吃食，突然听到有人喊他名字，呆在那里一脸傻懵。
环顾四周，只有靠角落一个空座位了。
脚下止了一瞬，转而又大步走了过去。
半步的迟疑是因为那个案台旁座，是顾胤良。


我和顾胤良的第一段梁子也是源于一场宫宴。
那年我五岁，顾胤良六岁。
酒足饭饱后，台下的大臣们愣是从南疆边境纷争聊到了东沧国太子新得了一颗三钱大的冠螺珠。
那时的我天生懒骨，走哪都是歪着倒着，正趴在太后的膝上打盹。
“说到世间珍宝，当属顾大人家的暖香玉。炎暑中自散馥香，冰寒天玉暖生烟。”
听罢，我从迷迷糊糊中起了精神，眼里慢慢聚起精光。
“顾大人，那暖香玉是供奉在在府中吗，哪天领我们一饱眼福？”
已然微醺的顾尚书摆摆手，笑道，“唉，一块玉石而已，谈不上稀奇，一直戴在小儿身上。”
至此我已经趁众人不注意，径自冲向台下。
顾家公子我认识，就是那一堆小人儿里稍微好看一点的那个。
我伸着手，直直的就往顾胤良扑过去，企图去拽他脖颈里的吊绳。
彼时顾胤良一脸惊恐，本能的一手护住自己的衣领，一手把我往外推。
嘿，我，楮婉扬，大楮皇室十三子嗣里唯一的掌上明珠，大名鼎鼎的嘉垣公主，自打生下来…</span>

这是一个狭长的省份，当最东边的庆阳看到第一缕阳光时，西边的敦煌还是明月高悬。巨大的经纬跨越，也扩大了早餐的选择范围，当甘肃人迎着日出逐渐醒来，他们手里的早餐，可能完全不同。


尽管如此，早餐赋予的是同样的朝气，以及，不管甘肃哪里的早餐，都长得十分“瓷实”。瓷实，是因为重视，甘肃有多重视早餐呢？这么说吧，牛肉面，甘肃最扎实，最著名的一碗面，兰州人就留给了早晨。
寻常的油条包子菜夹馍，是早餐中的一种吃法，如果你有心留意，走进甘肃各地街头巷尾热气蒸腾的早餐店里，会进入一个甘肃特色的早餐江湖——



当兰州人早上“扎”起一碗牛肉面，酒泉人在吃浓稠的糊锅，武威人在吃“硬核”菜面，张掖人在吃牛肉小饭，陇西人在吃热凉面，陇南人在吃面皮，天水人出门吃呱呱，在家就着干馍喝罐罐茶......

夜市的热闹被黑夜稀释殆尽，吃早餐的甘肃人平平淡淡，轻言细语，却是一份实在的温情。悠闲的人们，三言两语问候邻里，坐在店里吃完，再捎一份带将出去。分量超足的早餐吃完，甘肃人元气满满的一天，才正式开始。


 早上吃面，“肃面朝天”！
面条在外地，大多拿来当午餐或者晚餐，可甘肃人“固执”地认为，面条在早上口感最佳。兰州牛肉面能成为甘肃美食“一哥”，很大原因就是它在早餐界雷打不动的地位。不过，甘肃绝不只有牛肉面，各地都能看到早上“咥面”的场景，尤其是河西走廊各地，纷纷端出自己的牛肉面“改造款”。



不来个“牛大碗”，这床白起了！
在兰州，公认的主流早餐就三个字：牛肉面，再亲切些，两个字也行——牛大。许多兰州人每天开口说的第一句话，大概都是：“老板，来一碗牛大”！





每天的清晨六点半左右，数以千计的牛肉面馆同时开门营业，黄河两岸的大街小巷里，到处飘荡着牛肉面诱人的香味。
对于兰州人来说，牛肉面是可以私人定制的早餐，“师傅，下个二细，辣子多些蒜苗多…</span>

                    <span>肉的质地一直是个神奇的命题。
有的人烧出来的肉软硬适中，有的人照着同样的菜谱却死活做不出来。烧菜的火力、时间，甚至油、淀粉的使用都对肉的质地产生重要的影响。
肉是嫩还是老，核心点是温度，因为它决定了熟肉的2个核心要素：肌纤维的状态和水含量
回到上面这个提问来，我们先来看看肉越炖越烂、越炒越硬背后的原因。
也就是说，温度是怎么影响肉里面肌纤维状态和水含量的？


肉其实是个“水货”，肉重量的70-80%都是水。

可是这个“水货”伪装的特别好，即使它里面大部分是水，你却看不出来。
因为水不会流出来。
为什么不流出来呢？这就跟肌肉的结构有关系了。

肌肉是由一束束肌原纤维组成的，就是上图右上角的Myofibril，水就存在肌原纤维里面。
一般情况下，水是被紧紧包裹在里面的，即使你用力挤也挤不出来。
“时间就像肌肉里的水，你怎么挤也挤不出来”--开尔文
但是，如果肉的温度上升的话，里面的肌球蛋白和肌动蛋白就会因为聚集而失去弹性 (蛋白变性)，这种强悍的储水能力就消失了。

上图是牛肉在不同温度下逐步失水和变硬的过程，总的来说是有两轮的变化。
第一轮变化是在115-120°F (46-49°C)开始的，肉的体积开始缩小，因为肌球蛋白开始变性聚集了；
第二轮变化是在150-163°F (66-73°C) 开始，肉的体积开始进一步缩小，这回是肌动蛋白变性聚集了。
在整个变化的过程中，牛肉中的肌纤维在持续的聚集、收缩，把里面储存的水“挤”了出来。
原来被肌纤维包裹的“非自由水”变成了可以流动的“自由水”。
所以我们在用筷子捅一下半熟的牛排，能看到红色的血水渗出来。

就像上图一样，鸡肉的纤维在加热前是比较饱满的，在水煮或者焙烤后都发生了不同程度的脱水和皱缩。
也就是说，在温度上升时肉在同时经历变熟和变老的过程。
在原理上，食品安全和美味似乎是无法兼得的。
但努力的吃货们总有办法把这两种冲突错开。

比如我们针对肉片的大火爆炒。
在肌肉纤维收缩之前把肉煮熟了，然后在肉汁大量流出之前熄火，尽可能地保留肉片的口感。
但是对于厚度比较大的肉块，这样会增大肉块内外部的温差。
比如，大火煎一块厚牛排的时候，内外部的温差可能会达到40度以上，煎完时可能会出现下图中Blue rare这样的情况。

如果想做成左下角Medium rare这种效果呢？
那就得小火慢煎，将内外部的温差控制在15度以内，这样才比较好达到外焦里嫩的效果。
但是，对于炖煮了一两个小时的肉来说，上面的原理好像不完全适用。
明明已经长时间加热的肉，为什么还能保持不变老呢？
一是因为炖煮时候火候控制的比较好，水的损失比较少；
二是有一种新的物质代替了水，赋予了肉润滑的口感。
它就是结缔组织溶解后产生的明胶


在长时间的炖煮中，捆绑住肌纤维束的结缔组织会发生溶解.
这些新生成的明胶给我们的口腔提供了一种润滑的口感。
但是，被过度加热的明胶同样会被煮干，润滑的作用也会消失。
为什么烧完的肉反复加热会越来越老？
那是因为水和明胶被煮干了，肉变柴了，润滑的口感也消失了。
最典型的例子就是用微波炉加热剩菜。
因为微波炉加热的速度太快、过程中也没法观察，所以一不留神就会出现过度加热的情况。
用微波炉热好的肉菜，尤其是不带汤那种，拿出来时候容易会变得又干又硬。
所以，二次加热时候同样需要注意控制火候，避免过度加热。
这也是烧完的肉反复加热会变老的原因。

总结

温度是影响肉质地的关键，因为它决定这肌纤维的状态和肉的含水量。
温度上升时，肉在同时地变熟和变老。
大火爆炒、小火慢煎、炖煮等方法的恰当使用可以减少肉质变老。
二度加热时候要同样注意，避免过度加热把肉煮硬。

                    <span>说到「社交牛逼症」，我狼哥必须拥有姓名。
这人上过山，下过海，扛过枪，受过伤，手下百十号兄弟。
而我是个卖家发错货都不愿联系客服退换货的重度「社交恐惧症」患者。
我跟狼先生的感情之所以能维系至今，有两个重要原因：
一是我社恐得连分手都懒得说，二是他牛逼得没工夫搭理我。
1、
我叫小猫，一个长得有一点点儿好看，但命运不咋好看的女子，十八岁那年死过一次，后来又偷活了一生。
现在我三十六岁，在东北某新一线城市的风景区有一栋半山别墅，城区两端共有三套高层河景房，有一辆撒哈拉，一辆大指挥官，一辆指南者。
我这双手曾握过撬棍，抡过扳手，当过修车工，现在我是专职小说作者，大多数时间都在敲键盘，不敢自诩成功，但足以养活自己和自己的爱好。
可因为我至今独自生活，不喜欢与人交流，所以被贴了一身标签，剩女，败犬女，女汉子，单身主义，不婚主义，女权主义，诸如此类，不胜枚举。
其实这些都不是我，我不信奉任何主义，只是单纯地喜欢自由，没有活成这世界对女性定义的样子而已。
我喜欢硬派车，喜欢山河远阔，这是因为我在十八岁那年，傍上了一位四十岁的硬汉大佬。
没错，不是大款，是大佬，有那个社交牛逼症，兄弟一大堆，大的管叫他狼一，小的管他叫老大，我在这里就叫他狼先生。
而我与他初见时没有记忆，所以也没有名字，一切都是后来他给我的。
十八年前我们在一场婚礼上相遇，新郎是他一个兄弟，新娘是一位好心的小姐姐。
小姐姐叫江菲，是个文艺女青年，在济南一所大学门口开书店，通过交笔友爱上了一位兵哥哥杨一帆。
那年杨一帆退役，两人订好了年底结婚，她想招个临时看店的，而我就像个游魂一样，阴差阳错地闯了进来。
江菲说我当时简直惨得不像样，脸色惨白，头上包着绷带，不记得自己是谁，但很饿，急需一个吃饭的地方，隔壁饭店的人说她在招工，我就来了。
江菲胆子真大，不但收留了我，带我去医院换药，还帮我寻找家人，但最终没有结果，于是就在出嫁的时…</span>

红烧肉，中国餐桌的绝对主角。无论哪位厨子、无论哪种菜系，当与红烧肉狭路相逢的时候，所有的个性、技法、风格、创意，都要为这道国民大菜妥协让路。红亮、酥糯，五味调和、香气绵长，这是中国菜对红烧肉的共同标准，也是中国人对红烧肉的集体记忆。如果说麻婆豆腐、葱烧海参、白切鸡和蟹粉狮子头，分别代表了川、鲁、粤、淮扬的门面味道，是中国食谱里最受瞩目的四根台柱。那么红烧肉，无疑是凌驾其上的，更重要的国菜栋梁。一沽好酒一盅肉，一江明月一江秋。






No.1 壹
红亮的颜色，是红烧肉最诱人的标签，也是无数人为之垂涎的理由。吊诡的是，提供红烧肉颜色的主要成分：焦糖，却是无味的。无论是冰糖炒制的糖色，还是添加了焦糖的老抽酱油，它们的主要成分，是糖类受热碳化之后产生的焦糖酐(C12H18O9) 焦糖烯 (C36H50O25) 焦糖素(C125H188O80)等有机化合物。






它们几乎不提供人类能吸收利用的有效成分，所以人的味蕾也不易感受到它们的味道——有经验的厨师都知道，熬糖色，有甜味就是火候未到、有苦味就是熬得过头。真正恰到好处的糖色，应该尝不到任何味道。为什么这种无味的天然色素，被添加进平平无奇的炖肉中，却能让人的眼睛主观觉得“好吃”“香”“鲜美”？



其中原因，可能是人类大脑对美拉德反应带来的棕化物质，与焦糖这两种颜色外表相近的有机化合物产生了误判。众所周知，蛋白质是由多个氨基酸，以固定结构组成的肽链。人类只能吸收分散打碎的氨基酸，无法吸收其他生物的蛋白质：这是很多消化功能不好的人，会对部分高蛋白食物产生异体过敏的本质原因。一部分蟹、虾、蚝、贝，即便极简烹饪，或者生吃，也能感受到其中氨基酸鲜甜味，是因为低等生物的蛋白质结构相对简单，白酒、醋、姜蒜等简单腌料和人类的唾液，就能打碎它们的肽链。

                    <span>In the final round of the 2021 PNC Championship, Team Woods fired a 15-under 57 to get to 25-under par for the tournament and finish solo second.

This week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.

                    <span>In the opening round of the 2021 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods card a 10-under 62 to sit three shots back after Saturday in Orlando.

This week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.

Today I robbed banks and during the heist I would switch into NPC clothes to confuse the cops. The plan surprisingly worked and led to some insane events happening. There are a ton of funny moments in this GTA 5 episode, enjoy!

                    <span>我们通常以抢断和封盖来作为评价一名球员防守能力的指标，如果一个球员能够做到场均抢断封盖1+1，那么他很可能会是个不错的防守人。
​赛季至今，除去那些出场数不足的球员，总共有13人能做到抢断封盖1+1。如果把筛选条件收紧，要求至少抢断1.7+封盖1.1，目前就只有一人达标，那就是76人前锋赛布尔。
精英级别的防守是赛布尔在NBA立足的卖点，而在费城球队无法使用本-西蒙斯的当下，如何让赛布尔发挥能量势必会成为教练组内部讨论的重要议题。
我们也不妨就着这一话题展开讨论，探讨赛布尔使用上的确定性。
从2019年季后赛对位伦纳德以后，西蒙斯就确定了自己防守核心的战术地位。那么在西蒙斯缺席的当下，能否利用赛布尔的防守能力，弥补西蒙斯不在带来的影响？
在给出答案之前，我们或许可以看看赛布尔这赛季在防守端的角色，看看他在防守端都做了些什么事情。
比如在刚结束的对阵篮网的比赛，赛布尔就被指派了单防杜兰特的任务。赛布尔之所以能被赋予如此重要的防守职能，无非是对他防守能力的信赖，而他的能力也有数据支撑：赛季至今，和赛布尔对位的进攻球员平均命中率只有35.4%。



你也可以看到，即便是强如杜兰特，对上赛布尔也很少采用拉开一对一的方式，因为赛布尔足够强壮，可以顶住进攻球员的背身；横移速度够快，也不吃晃，想拉开强突不容易，同时有一对长臂和不俗的瞬间爆发力来干扰进攻球员的投篮，想要一对一占到便宜实在很难。
或许下面这个进攻回合，你可以感受到赛布尔单防的压力：当杜兰特原地干拔投篮，赛布尔顺势举手上前干扰，而他举手干扰的高度是真的可以挡到杜兰特投篮视野的。
杜兰特投篮被干扰的情景，好像不常见吧？



杜兰特当然知道防他的小伙子是个强者，所以他也没有非要用一对一这种吃力不讨好的方式展开进攻。
面对赛布尔的防守，杜兰特更多是采用无球跑动甩开，再接队友的传球攻筐，或者持球利用队友设置的掩护，借此绕开赛布尔的…</span>

本周话题：音乐是反社交
Spotify 的前产品经理有一天在推特发言，总结自己这些年在音乐行业的心得。
第一条心得就很震撼。
&quot;本质上，音乐不是社交产品，而是反社交的。&quot;

我看到以后，愣了一下，马上意识到，这句话说得太对了。音乐和社交是对立的，音乐产品不合适加入社交功能。
听音乐的时候，绝大多数都是一个人，而且都是静静地听，没人喜欢在吵闹的环境听。音乐是一种心灵对话，是孤独时候的陪伴，不具有社交性。

聚会时，大家不会一起听音乐。音乐从来不是社交活动，相比之下，美食、逛街、旅游、甚至看电影，这些才是社交行为，一个人去做没有乐趣。
音乐不具有社交性，还有一个原因，那就是很少有人对你听什么音乐感兴趣。你真的在意，朋友喜欢听哪一首歌吗？
因此，音乐产品应该是个人化产品，关注的重点是个人使用，而不应该加入社交元素。
世界最大的两个音乐应用 Spotify 和 Apple Music 都没有社交元素，界面都很清爽，几乎没有听音乐以外的功能。


它们有全世界最庞大的用户群，最精准的兴趣匹配算法，却没有提供任何的交友和社区功能。这是他们的产品经理没有想到，还是觉得就不应该添加这种功能？
形成鲜明对照的是，国内的音乐大厂&quot;网易云音乐&quot;，主打功能就是社交。打开它的 App，处处都有社交元素，可以查看每首歌的网友点评，收听他人的歌单和电台，还可以加好友、聊天、建社交圈。

网易云音乐的官方定位是&quot;一个快速发展的云生态音乐社区&quot;，口号是&quot;和超8亿有趣的人听歌看…</span>

                    <span>电影《雄狮少年》今天终于上映了！从2019年到今天，经过两年多的时间，今天终于要和大家见面了，关于对于这部电影的评价，我想把它交给观众。今天我想跟大家分享一下这部电影一些创作点滴和自己的一些背景。
根据我们故事的风格和特点，我们整个美术风格是偏写实的，卡通程度没有那么高。镜头里的场景，光影，氛围都在尽量还原真实的岭南村庄。而我们的角色必须融入这个环境，没有违和感，而且用他们演绎一个这么烟火气的故事必须可信。
狮头我们完全是按照真实狮头来的，没有加入过多设计，因为我们觉得真实狮头的设计就已经非常经典了。而真实的南派狮头是有多种风格的，因此我们在电影里采用了三种不用造型的狮头：“传统狮头”（陈壮成、年轻时的咸鱼强使用的狮头）“新派狮头”（阿娟使用的狮头）和“鹤山狮头”（无极狮队使用的狮头）


关于人物

刚开始尝试了很多版本，每个角色大概都有7-8稿吧，有些设计是很成熟的，但总觉得没有画出我们心中那种有烟火气的市井的感觉。
后来我们找到了光圈，他的设计风格正好和我们的需求完美契合，每个角色几乎都是第一稿就能确定方向。
最终定版人物形象的原因：小人物的故事、突出小人物的朴素感、结合故事背景是乡村少年、故事中的人物最终也要打破偏见


关于场景

因为我们大部分故事是发生在乡下，所以我们跑遍了广州周边各种村落。
最后我们在顺德找到了两个最符合我们想象的村子：百丈村和北水村，这里有鱼塘，村里的房子就散布在大大小小的鱼塘上，非常漂亮。而且还有一些很有历史的祠堂和老宅子，最重要的是，这里还有很多村民居住，很有生活气息。

有些村子虽然很有历史，但已经变成旅游景点，村民基本已经不在那里生活了，感觉只剩一个壳，没有灵魂了。






然后我团队就开始一遍遍去这两个村子里采风，搜集各种村民生活的细节，还有了解村里的植被，南方乡村的植被是很有特点的，非常丰富。
我们要了解这里植被的种类，墙上的青苔是怎样的，缝隙里的小草是怎样的，有哪些常见的树，怎样分布的。




还有这些植物的四季变化，因为我们故事的时间跨度有一年多，我们的采风也持续了一年。
同时我们还开发了一系列的技术流程去呈现这些内容，为了研究木棉的生长规律，我们特效总监甚至把电脑搬去一棵木棉树下去工作了两天。

最后呈现出来的效果我们都非常满意，观看有些画面时甚至都能闻到村子里的味道。大家都觉得这些付出很值得。


关于舞狮

首先是动作的问题，舞狮有很多技巧，专业性很强，要通过肢体动作去表现狮子各种各样的神态，之前我们是完全不了解的。为了弥补这个问题，我们导演组和动画师特意去专业的舞狮队做了培训，然后才开始设计舞狮相关的动作场面。为了打起来更漂亮，我们还融合了一些武术和舞蹈动作，做了适当的夸张。
然后就是布料和毛发的解算问题，狮子身上的毛发非常多，而且是多层布料解算（舞狮队员身上有衣服，然后外面还要披上狮尾），再加上狮尾复杂的剪裁方式（现代的狮尾结构很复杂，中间还加了橡皮筋增加弹性，在舞狮的时候可以伸缩）是一个非常复杂的系统工程。我们都一一作了仔细的研究和测试，最终在三维软件中模拟出完美的动态。
最后就是渲染，毛发渲染一向是三维渲染中最耗时的工作之一，一两头狮子还好。但我们的决赛有130多头狮子出现，现场看台上有1800多个观众，再加上公园里围观的1000多名游客，还有大量茂密的植被......想想就是一件很可怕的事情，最初我们都不确定能不能渲染出来，我们做了大量的研究和开发工作才能保证决赛镜头的顺利渲染。
我们这部电影在条件有限的情况下，大家都憋足了一口气要做最棒的作品，这种感觉太棒了，能和他们一起创作是我的荣幸。

要特别说一句的是我们音乐总监栾慧，他为了这部作品推掉了很多工作，专门从东北老家来到广州在我们楼下宾馆里搭建了一个工作室和我们一起工作了半年多，所以这次我们的音乐和画面契合度非常高，因为我随时都能下楼和他一起讨论关于音乐的想法，而且他随时都能上楼看到我们最新的画面，甚至有很多重要戏份的剪辑都是根据他的音乐，我和他一起做了精确的调整，达到音乐和画面的完美匹配。
而且我们在制作中经历了疫情封锁，我们公司所在的芳村正好处于疫情中心，一夜之间整个区域停止一切活动，我们只能居家办公，也因此导致了制作的延期，当时的绝望情绪现在还历历在目，还好政府迅速控制住了疫情，而我们也利用这次延期的机会做了一些很重要的修改，让我们的作品更进一步，也算是因祸得福吧。
   很荣幸这一路遇到了很多志同道合的朋友们，也感谢那些与我们素未谋面的观众们的喜爱和支持。希望更多人也能关注到我们国产原创动画，也希望中国传统文化被更多年轻人追逐。

                    <span>想来聊点背后的故事。或许有生之年很难再遇上像2020东京奥运一样的情形了（也别再来了）。
 备赛四年变五年。记不清是央视采访哪位运动员来着，她说，“那天一早去训练馆，瞅着倒计时牌从100多天跳成了400多天。一下泄了劲儿，特崩溃”。100%的真实回应，不分项目，也无关国籍。
就我而言，多出来的一年，比前面四年难得多的多。撇开年龄和体能，最大的顾虑是家庭。因为疫情，得全封闭训练。其实我家就住天津，离不远的，两个女儿都还小外加老人，本是最需要我的时候，担子却全落在了妻子身上。
艳子曾经也是一名举重运动员，所有的纠结和挣扎她最懂。后来，她反倒跑来宽慰我说，“就暂时把你交给国家了。（其他）别担心。”这话，是真扎到我心里了，同时也是继续坚持的最大动力。
 说回备战，变化很多。先是时隔20年首次级别调整。我那会考虑到岁数大之后你降体重，肯定对各方面有影响。索性打81，上了4公斤。但实际上，我和余导对把增加的体重转换成更稳定的技术这方面，什么经验都没有。
 东奥最棘手还有个什么呢，是国际举联修改的新积分规则，要求必须在2018年11月-2020年4月的三个比赛区间内完成6站积分赛。相当于每两个月就得打一次高强度比赛。就这段时间，我遭遇了生涯内最艰难的一场比赛。也是给自己逼到绝境的一场。
 2019年9月的泰国芭提雅积分赛，决定拿不拿得到东奥入场券的关键比赛。抓举我开把是165，有点着急了，往前迈了两步掉了，把腰扭了。一个小关节的错位，当时没感觉太出来。第三把，我和小14岁的队友李大银都抓了171。一切就看挺举了。
 两项间歇时，身体反应就显出来了。动不了，腰肌一下子缩到一团，弯腰都弯不下去。没办法，只能把挺举第一把从计划的200降到191，想着先保个总成绩吧。杠一扔，痛感爆发，走路都走不了，人被架着下场了。
当时余导过来劝，要不放弃吧，别把身体搞坏了。怎么说呢，没来及想什么多的，就一条，不想放弃每一把，边趴着敷冰袋边回：“不可能，确实不能（弃）”。完了第二把直接加到了205。因为是最高重量，可以等全部人举完再上，也算是战术给自己换多点休息时间。
 205，是刷新世界纪录的重量。完全是咬死了牙才撑起来的。杠一扔，人就往一边歪了，勉强没倒地。没多久，大银最后一把举过了206，二刷纪录。当时全场就剩我的第三把，顶了个207。这是一个我从来没有在国际比赛上挑战过的重量，但能不能去东京就此一举了。再怎么疼，也不想留遗憾，必须再试一把，给它拼了！

要说犹没犹豫过腰伤呢，也犹豫，但一上台感觉就来了。也不是纯说胜负欲吧，就是想把最好的一面展现给全世界热爱举重的人看。我是真喜欢台上的感觉。
 说到胜负欲，对2016年的里约奥运，是有的。五年来继续坚持的理由，有它一份，想再较量一把，还是有那么点不服气吧。
 说个东奥决赛开场前的小插曲，也是后来少见开把没成的教训。权当给大伙避雷。
 那会中国举重队已经收了三个级别的冠军，我是有压力的。后台区就一直在调情绪，调着调着感觉要爆棚了，还跑去跟余导提“要不开抓170吧”。没同意，依旧165，完了没带起来（兴奋过头随意了）。下场余导很严肃说要重视，我也跟自己说：“就两把了，不能再乱来了。”静下来一步步想动作，怎么带，怎么展。抓举成绩稳在了170。

 挺举开把实话说有瞬间，闪过了2016年的画面。抬杠那下，还是有点害怕掉了的，咬牙硬顶。197一过，心态就完全放开了。第二把204，从握杠就憋足了气，完事锁定金牌后，是有点小喜悦的，趁着斗志又报了210。翻站的时候调铃没有调好，稍微歪了点，丢了。有点可惜。
 评价什么的不敢讲，比赛很享受，但过程真的很难很难。最想说的是，这份荣誉不光属于个人，而是实实在在地属于整个中国举重队。
 我是吕小军，一个像热爱生命一样热爱举重的中国人。

                    <span>总要有人去做一些不同的事
——写于国重成立十周年
计算机体系结构国家重点实验室（以下简称国重）成立十年了，这是一个里程碑。在脑海中回忆着和国重相关的事，一幕幕场景浮现，甚至包括2003年第一次到计算所参加研究生复试的场景。那时，计算所历经沧桑的大门还在，而自己还是一张科研白纸，不知道如果被计算所录取了，将来会在这里干什么。幸运的是跌跌撞撞地通过计算所的面试，正式成为一名“计算所人”，从此开启了科研人生，也开始认识和体会计算所的使命感。
在和国重相关的众多回忆中，有一句话反复浮现：“总要有人去做一些不同的事”。这是国重主任孙凝晖院士平日里和大家交流时对使命感的一种通俗的解读——当大多数人都去做相同的事、都去追求相同的东西时，国重要鼓励和支持有人去做一些不同的事。我是国重这种发展理念的积极响应者，也是这种理念的最大受益者之一，我的成长就是去做了不同阶段国重所鼓励的、和主流有点不同的事。
（一）
2006年以前，计算所的系统方向一直都是专注于承担龙芯、曙光这样的大项目。但从2006年起，计算所开始重视在计算机体系结构基础研究上布局。于是在2006年，国重的前身——中科院计算机系统结构重点实验室（院重）成立了。那时国内还是SCI论文盛行，时任计算所所长的李国杰院士认为不应该追求SCI论文，而是呼吁要重视在国际顶级会议上发表论文。
明确了方向和目标，大家的努力便开始逐渐起成效了：2006年、2007年先后突破了计算所第一篇SC和SPAA，2008年又突破了HotChips、SIGMETRICS、ICS，2009年顶会论文又上一个台阶（HPCA、SC、ICS、DSN、2篇CGO），2010年继续一路高歌（2篇ISCA、PLDI、HPCA、3篇CGO等）……
那段时间我也是积极响应，把发表顶会论文作为目标，也有所收获，在2008年发表了SIGMETRICS，2010年发表了HPCA，也因…</span>

While being on a steady rise for years, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased reported cases of poor mental health significantly. KFF reports that the implications of the pandemic have resulted in 4 in 10 adults reporting symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorders. The increase in cases has a risk to further stress the US’s overburdened mental health system. Advancements of AI in health care could show promising results for the tre…</span>

                    <span>新晋网红店铺开了一茬又一茶，北京很少是首选，搞得饱妹经常只能眼馋上海的朋友，偷偷留下羡慕的口水泪水。


这次盼星星盼月亮，终于盼来了长沙代表队的中式点心店：虎头局渣打饼行。于是网红拔草栏目回归！跟着福桃，让你好汉不吃网红亏！





饱情提示：本文全程无广，可放心食用。
虽然饱妹买得多，架不住饱弟吃得也多啊！
（都吃完了，没浪费的意思）
和大多把选址锁定在三里屯周边的店铺不同，虎头局的北京首店选在了五棵松华熙LIVE，从五棵松地铁站B口出来，穿过“灯红酒绿”的走廊，直达五棵松华熙LIVE。





汤城小厨的广告牌如同饱妹寒冷冬日里的一盏明灯，看见它便是找到了对的方向，进入旁边的门，虎头局渣打饼行就在左手边。





饱妹到店门口的时间是工作日的10：23，店内外加起来仍排了十个人左右，跟游乐园一样的S型排队通道还未开启。





▲恰好在饱妹点单时，后面进来了一位免排队的孕妇
通道内摆放有“孕妇免排队”的标志牌，队尾有店员负责测温和扫码的工作，还有一份菜单供顾客提前了解产品。





店门口陈列着菜单中在售的点心，饱妹问过店员后得知：这些点心都不是模型，而是和售卖的点心同批出炉的产品，葡挞、盘挞和白玉卷这类原材娇弱的会每日更换，其余则是通过外貌来判断当日是否更换，展示品不会进行售卖（想到销毁有点心疼）。





饱妹观察买到手的顾客，基本都是一大袋子起步，两大袋子是标配，颇有置办年货的气势。饱妹点完单的时间是10：51，店门外开始使用S型通道进行排队，除了菜单外，还有店员在队列中分发“预点单”和为顾客提供建议，节省在点单处的时间。





▲人多时会使用的预点单
拿到点心的顾客也许是因为经历了排队和装袋的等待，都会先掏出手机给点心拍照，喜悦之情溢于言表，颧骨升天说明了一切。









▲就算戴着口罩打了码也能感受到他们的快乐
点完单可以在店的周围等…</span>

                    <span>In this blog post, we will learn how to build a TypeScript util type, that exposes all the key paths of an object, including the nested ones.
Have you ever built TypeScript function that receives a specific property of an object, by specifying the object and the path to that object&#x27;s property? Something like this:
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,
  dog:{
    name: &quot;Rex&quot;,
  }
}

function get(object: ObjectType, path: string){
  const keys &#x3D; path.split(&#x27;.&#x27;);
  let result &#x3D; object;
  for (const key of keys) {
    result &#x3D; result[key];
  }
  return result;
}

get(person, &quot;dog.name&quot;) // Rex

Well, obviously this works very well, but you aren&#x27;t taking full advantage of TypeScript! You can easily do a typo on the second argument (path) and lose some precious type with debug…</span>

                    <span>The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object&#x27;s prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.
let us look at an example

let person &#x3D; {};

person.name &#x3D; &quot;David&quot;;
person.age &#x3D; 45;

person.eat &#x3D; function() {
console.log(&#x60;person is eating&#x60;);
}

Here we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.

When you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.
So the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.
When a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:
Returns undefined (if you tried to access a property).

                    <span>The bundler configuration for a Chrome Extension can be pretty complex. When I started making Chrome Extensions, they were small projects for clients who wanted to automate a task. I was starting a new Chrome Extension almost every week, and it took too much time to configure a new project. Then I thought, &quot;We already have a manifest; why do we need more config files?&quot;
That&#x27;s the idea behind rollup-plugin-chrome-extension, also known as RPCE. My name is Jack Steam, and I&#x27;ve been hard at work over the last few months adding Vite support to RPCE. So today, I&#x27;m excited to invite you to try out RPCE with Vite.
RPCE makes it easy to set up a Chrome Extension project with a modern development experience. How easy? Let me show you.

Branding yourself online has become increasingly important as landing a role in the tech industry is constantly getting more competitive. If you want to freelance, creating a personal brand is the absolute best way to land roles, but it’s still important for those of us looking to gain more traditional roles. Creating a strong online presence that is clearly branded will help employers and clients understand exactly what you can do for them. It will also create a strong sense of skill and authenticity, as well as display your communication skills. Plus, it’s a great way to network.
So what exactly goes into creating a personal brand? The good news is that you don’t need to be a marketing expert to accomplish this, you just need to spend a bi…</span>

We’re going to expand our application so that it provides the same RESTful HTTP API as a json-server.
We’re not going to deeply examine Fielding&#x27;s definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn&#x27;t RESTful. Instead, we’ll take a simplified view and concern ourselves with how RESTful APIs are understood in web applications.
One convention is to create the unique address for resources by combining the name of the resource type with the resource&#x27;s unique identifier.
Let&#x27;s assume that the root URL of our service is example.com/api.

                    <span>What is a Linked List?


Linked List is a fundamental and linear data structure which is known for it&#x27;s high performance on insertion &amp; deletion. It is commonly used as a building block in other data structures like Queues, Graphs and Trees. With that, we can also say Linked List is an important step to understand these data structures - as well as building custom ones.
There are different variations of Linked Lists: Singly Linked List (or we just say Linked List unless it is specified), Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List, and more. For more details on variations, take a look at the Wikipedia page: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
Among variations, Singly and Doubly Linked Lists are the most common ones. In this article we will be focusing on Singly Linked Lists.

                    <span>Improving performance is an art. To me, chasing performance issues feels like it flexes the same muscles as debugging. You&#x27;re wading into the unknown with only a sliver of information. But instead of understanding why it does that one weird thing, you&#x27;re asking adjacent questions: Where is it slow? Why is it slow? Then of course, How can it be improved?
This post will be the first in a series outlining how I approach improving performance, specifically for laggy UIs built with React. Even though this will mention tools and techniques specific to React, a fair amount of this would transfer to general-purpose optimization work. No matter the environment or tools, I&#x27;m trying to answer the same questions.
So, you have a UI that feels slow. Where do you start? This post will cover two big chunk…</span>

                    <span>The field of Machine Learning has become an extremely hot topic, both in academia and in industry. Its far-reaching applications include autonomous vehicles, smart home technology, Speech-to-Text APIs and software, fraud detection, streaming service recommendations, image recognition, and much more.
As more advances are made in Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, expect these applications to become even more far reaching and ingrained into our everyday lives.
This post looks at some of the top Machine Learning conferences planned for 2022. 2021 saw the return of some in-person conferences, though most remained hybrid in-person/virtual events at the very least. Expect this trend to continue in 2022 as well.

                    <span>As I decided to create my blog I choose Next.js as my framework of choice, as a backend I use markdown files stored in a git repo. 
To render my files I use React Markdown. It&#x27;s an awesome component that can render markdown files without any config.
After a few posts, I figured out that I need some custom components rendered with my posts. One was for images, to make them zoomable for phones and the second one was a syntax highlighter for code snippets. 
React has a huge amount of components that can help us with both of these. I decided to use  react-zoom-pan-pinch for image zoom and react-syntax-highlighter for syntax highlight.
Ok. I have my components, not how to render them from our markdown files. Fortunately, React Markdown has us covered. It allows us to do a custom rendering of so…</span>

                    <span>Vagrant, topluluk tarafından fazla bilinmese de aslında tıpkı Docker gibi bir sanallaştırma aracı. Ancak tabii ki Docker&#x27;dan daha eski ve aralarında temel olarak ayrışmış farklar var.
Bunlardan en bilineni, Docker sistem ve ağ servislerinin kullanımında geride kalırken Vagrantın tıpkı yeni bir sanal makineymiş gibi bu servisleri de beraberinde getirerek tamamen gerçekçi test ortamları sağlaması.
Örneğin test ederken çeşitli sistem servislerini görüntülemeniz gereken bir yazılım geliştiriyorsanız, Vagrant sizin için bulunmaz bir nimetken Docker biraz daha geri planda kalıyor.
Bu yazıda da Docker&#x27;dan daha yavaş çalışan, daha çok kaynak kullanan ancak gerekli durumlarda bir kahramana dönüşen Vagrant&#x27;ın en çok kullanılan sunucu dağıtımlarından biri olan Ubuntu 20.04 üzerine nasıl kurulacağında…</span>

                    <span>每年的下半年是各种考试的密集区——对于学生党来讲是一年之中的大考，考个好分数，开心好过年；而对于职场人来讲，下半年，各类的专业技术能力考试与职业资格考试充斥，而且不少公司内部也有各种形式的让人开心的内部测验。
但凡是场考试，基本上都是绕不过去的。只有考和考，这样一个选项，所以备考的功课多多少少是要做的。
然而工作了之后，每天真正能够用于学习的时间却是非常少的。而当有了结婚生子之后，可利用的时间又会在非常少的基础之上，再度减少。做点属于自己的事情就要见缝插针。
针对这样的情况，结合我自身的经历，我对自己学生时代的备考方法进行一下调整，在备考过程中用起来还不错。我就把它整理了一下，于是就有了这篇分享。这当中的部分做法不仅可以用在备考之中，也可以用于其他笔记记录。
我的方法主要包括两部分，一是基于 A4 稿纸基础之上的笔记整理，另一个是基于错题整理基础之上的知识体系重构。
我整理的一本备考笔记，类似的我还有好几本
关于考试与测验
我们日常参加的各种考试一般分为两种：一种是测试过关能力测试，一种是选拔人头。感兴趣的可以去了解效标参照性标准体系与常模参照性指标体系。
为了便于理解，这里举个栗子。老师组织了一场考试，60 分及以上视为合格，分数最高的人可以获得一等奖。这里「60 分及以上视为合格」就是属于前者，完成通关任务就行；而「一等奖」这种大事一般来讲只会有一个人，无论难易。听到规则之后，每个人都会根据自身的情况进行评判并作出相应的决策，或是稍微躺平，或是努力奋斗。
讲这个的主要目的其实就是，我们的时间与精力是有限的，对于那些属于过关类的考试不要全部押宝上去，合理分配，以实现相对最优的投入产出比。
考试，不管是四六级考试、研究生考试，还是职业资格考试、专业技术资格考试（职称考试）都会有各种各样的辅导班。不少人也会去选择报名这样的辅导班。当然无论辅导班是否对自己的考试有助力，最终的考…</span>

                    <span>Windows 11 带来了全新的视觉、听觉体验和不少令人耳目一新的功能。不出所料的是，这些更新还搀杂了各种全新的 Bug 和特性。当然这似乎是一种潮流：几家科技巨头都热衷于在发布会和宣传片上炫耀新功能，却留下各类恼人的 Bug 或「特性」供开发人员修复到猴年马月。更何况 Windows 只占微软整体收入一小部分，市场中又没有任何产品足以与之竞争，指望微软官方短时间内有动力提供更好的系统体验太过不切实际。
不过使用 Windows 时的遇到诸多不顺自有应对之道。如果你苦恼于莫名宕机的开始菜单，存在感极强但作用不大的 Teams 和小组件，亦或者愤满于微软高筑的软件迁移门槛，那么下面的这些技巧或许能帮助到你。部分技巧同样适用于 Windows 10。
通过文件和链接类型更换默认浏览器
是的，更换默认浏览器竟然再次成为了需要拿出来说的东西。
如果你是从 Windows 10 升级到 Windows 11，那么你的浏览器设置将会被保留。而如果你的 Windows 11 为全新安装，现在想从 Edge 切换到其他的浏览器，在目前（22000.348）版本中，你会发现原来的「默认程序」界面不再提供切换默认浏览器功能。这显然是为了提高用户从 Edge 迁出的门槛。

现版本如果想要切换某浏览器为默认，需要更多的步骤。假设我们想要将 Liberwolf 设定为默认浏览器，需打开设置面板，进入 应用 &gt; 默认应用 &gt; Liberwolf，将 .html、.htm、HTTP 和 HTTPS 四个条目设置为 Liberwolf。

微软的这种举动倒逼部分厂商做出回应。从官网下载的 Firefox 用户目前可直接的浏览器设置中将 Firefox 设置为默认。Windows 应用商店中 Firefox 则无此功能。

                    <span>和 Android 系统一样，很多 Android 应用也会选择将源码进行开放，一方面供开源社区对代码进行审查保证安全性，另一方面也能「集思广益」，经其它开发者之手发展、演变出更多有意思的代码分支和功能。
更重要的是，因为源码人人可获取，当这些应用的商店版本（如 Play 商店）因为各种原因更新缓慢，或原始分支不再维护时，我们也可以直接绕过商店、借助源码编译「原汁原味」的最新版本。
本文就为大家介绍一种相对简单、能够自给自足的 Android 应用编译方法。
自己编译应用需要哪些工具？
要想编译 Android 项目，首先我们就先来看看项目源码的一般目录结构，了解我们需要一些什么样的编译工具。

编程语言：2021 年 Android 项目主要支持的编程语言是 Java 和 Kotlin。两者语言都是运行在 JVM 环境中，都需要各自的编译器 javac 和 kotlinc 把源码编译为 JVM 的字节码。
包管理器：Android 项目常见的包管理器是 Gradle，它负责管理和下载项目的第三方依赖，并且构建出可安装运行的 Android 安装包 (apk)。
开发套件：开发套件在图中是一个隐藏的依赖 —— Android SDK 。在大部分的平台架构上开发 GUI 程序，基本绕不开平台的 SDK。
至此，我们了解清楚了我们所需要的工具，那么下一个问题就是从哪里获取这些工具。
传统编译方法比较麻烦在哪里？
传统的办法编译 Android 项目是下载 Android Studio 集成开发环境，作为一个 IDE 它包含了上述所需要的全部的工具，但是它也有以下的弊端：

从 Android Studio 下载指定的 Android SDK 版本也还需要一定的步骤
Android Studio 自带的 Java 版本较新，不一定能编译通过旧代码
Gradle 下载依赖的时候由于…</span>

Android 12L Beta 1 发布

本周，Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本已经发布，但其实 Android 12L 对于大部分 Android 爱好者其实也都不算太陌生：毕竟如果你有仔细看周报的话，上一次提到 Android 12L，大家想到的可能都是关于 Google 折叠屏手机项目（又称 Pixel Fold）搁浅的新闻。

 
但作为 Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本，我们还是可以借此了解更多 Android 12L 中的新特性：毕竟除了面向大屏/高 DPI 显示所做的优化之外，Android 12L 本身也有「Android 12.1」这一另一层含义，因此也包括一些对于原生 Android 12 使用体验上的改进。

在 UI 细节上，Android 12L 为了应对大屏使用，类似壁纸设置 UI 等二级菜单都采用了浮窗而非先前的全屏设计，最近应用页面中的「清除所有应用」按钮也加上了 Android 12L 风格的圆角矩形边框，很多 UI 操作细节都变得更加顺滑自然；符合 Android 12 整体对于 UI 动效的调整风格。触觉反馈的调整也更加柔和，这些本身都是 Pixel 系列的强项，Android 12L 中只是进一步优化了体验细节。

另外，在 Android 12 正式版中没有的投…</span>

                    <span>这个原因其实非常简单：
如果你看过2017年，ssg夺冠之路，我相信你也会非常喜欢这支队伍。
如果各位刚好有时间，我就凭记忆回顾一下S7都发生了什么，然后你就明白为什么管泽元（包括我）喜欢ssg，喜欢crown了
本身2017年我也是全年在看LCK，一场不落，而管泽元也经常去解说lck的比赛。我们都见证并经历了SSG的传奇！（这个教练非常厉害 ，还有替补haru是狮子狗本命，据说只拿狮子狗上王者，后来我记得很多lck比赛他拿狮子狗必赢的，这就叫本命英雄）

三星是S7的3号种子，可以说是从悬崖下又爬上来的，一路过关斩将，拿到了最后一个名额，为了拿这个名额，不容易，都是劲敌，但时间久远，我忘了都是什么队了，反正都很厉害。
补充：鉴于很多朋友比较关心，我查询并记起了当年ssg拿三号种子的大致过程。
2017年的lck是SSG，AFS，MVP三支队伍打冒泡赛，其中的胜者再和kt打，才能获得最后一个名额。
当时LZ一号种子，SKT二号种子。然后ssg赢了afs和mvp中的胜者后（我印象中好像是afs赢了），还要和kt再打才有资格拿到三号种子。而kt众所周知是当时的银河战舰，看看这豪华阵容：
smeb是当时世界第一上单，即便在s8也能按着duke杀，和巅峰the shy打得有来有回。打野score是老牌野王了，中路是刚从edg回去的佛祖pawn将军，下路飞行员deft+号称最强大脑的曾获得S4世界冠军的fmvp获得者mata。当时kt还有个笑话，叫LPL三杰，意思是：从LPL回来的三个都是菜逼（pawn，mata，deft），全靠smeb和老队长在c

再看看afs有多强？SKT刚拿下三冠，风头正盛，lck也是当之无愧第一赛区，而当时afs是全世界对skt胜率最高的队伍！比抗韩奇侠闪电狼还高不少！我记得那年春季赛afs遇到skt基本没输过，把我看蒙了，心想马大头打老东家是真滴狠。

                    <span>最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。

与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。

虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。



游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。



《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。
最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。
说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。

虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。

Let&#x27;s face it. You can&#x27;t do everything. Or at least not efficiently in time. And time is one of the most valuable resources you have. That&#x27;s why many founders will tell you to find a co-founder for your idea. In most cases a mix of technical and sales based skillset would be very helpful. 
Since I work as a developer, it seems easy to find someone else with a technical background. And that&#x27;s how I met your... my co-founder.
There probably are a ton of todo apps out there. And thats okay. Everyone has its own preferences and tastes when choosing a new product. In many cases you will use the most famous product which seems to solve 80 % of t…</span>

                    <span>Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. 
Our mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future. Join our platform to learn more about what opportunities Interniac can offer you!

                    <span>BY NOW, most of the internet knows about the famous Log4Shell exploit, and if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s easy to get a sense of how disastrous it&#x27;s been. To drive the point home: the US Department of Homeland Security is warning people about it.
There&#x27;s been a lot of hand-wringing about how open source software, the lifeblood of many businesses today, is often totally unpaid and unthanked work, with some hot takes like &#x27;Open source needs to grow the hell up.&#x27; and &#x27;Open source&#x27; is broken.
What I want to touch on is something that&#x27;s been bothering me for the past few days, and solidified after seeing Bloomberg&#x27;s piece–the fact that the log4j developers had this massive security issue dumped in their laps, with the expectation that they were supposed to fix it. How did that happen? How did a group of sm…</span>

                    <span>When dealing with SQL databases, users will have to interact with different data types and schemas depending on the project&#x27;s requirements. Since databases are used in many different applications and support multiple platforms, devices, and users, there may be differences in how data is entered, even in a simple field like a phone number.
For example, one set of users will enter the phone number with the country code, while the others may simply ignore the country code. Therefore, it is essential for database users to know how to clean data in a SQL database. In this post, we will see how to utilize SQL string operations on phone number fields to properly clean, format, and extract data.
Data comes in all forms and sizes. Most of the time, it will be raw data, without proper formatting. Da…</span>

Of course, I watched a lot of tutorials during my learning journey, and I still do to gain more knowledge about certain things and improve my skills on a daily basis.
But even as I&#x27;m watching and following along with the tutorial, I&#x27;m already taking in the good things I could use from that tutorial in my head and thinking about how I could use them in one of my own projects.
A good example is the To Do List tutorial, which everyone seems to have enough of already. And actually, I don&#x27;t quite understand. If you watch a really good tutorial on h…</span>

                    <span>In my last blog post on Airtable, I showed how to send a text message in under one minute with no code using the Send SMS Airtable App--but did you know that you can also write scripts in Airtable and make automations that run in a variety of intervals? In this post you’ll learn to automate text messages from Airtable using Twilio Studio and JavaScript.

                    <span>I had someone recently reach out to me to ask &quot;What is Suspense in the general sense?&quot; They said all they could find was React resources. And I told them that made sense they coined the term. But looking around I realized it was more than that.
When I look at the topic as explained in most articles it talks about the symptoms of the Suspense component but not really what it is. So I&#x27;m going to try to show today why it is so much more than a component that renders placeholders.
Consistent display of information is a fundamental expectation of a good user interface. If you show users inconsistent information within the same page(without indicating it) it erodes trust.

                    <span>不久前某刚到深圳的工友咨询深圳有无「正常」的披萨，就是只有番茄奶酪罗勒烤出来的，没有那些稀奇古怪顶料的简单披萨，大家推荐了许多店但几乎都不能完全满足这看似没有需求的需求。而我认为大家既然都已经是成熟的大人了，不妨自给自足？
有人戏说披萨就是中式馅饼的变种——它把馅儿给裹在了饼外面，或许是因为这个原因，以必胜客为主的中低端披萨店会给其做一些莫名其妙的改良，什么咖喱、麻辣甚至烤鸭披萨都常能见到，反而一些最基础的传统披萨被隐藏在菜单角落，并且味道也非常一般。
尝试过在家制作一次披萨后，大概猜到那些莫名其妙的「创意披萨」或许并不全是为了迎合中式饮食的噱头，而是基础披萨虽然制作简单并且食材普通，但它却非常需要耐心——而这往往是普通披萨店成本最高的地方。所以我想通过这篇文章和你分享如何在家自制披萨，我想你应该能学会，而我相信当你吃过这块「一点都不快」的披萨之后，再也对街边的披萨店提不起任何兴趣。
哪种披萨最好吃
当看到我说「在家自制披萨」时，想必你一定满头问号——做什么披萨？且不论前文提到出现在国内各个快餐店里稀奇古怪的创意披萨，就算是所谓的「传统披萨」，也分为美式披萨和意式披萨两大流派，再往下根据不同国家不同城市的流行饮食文化还演变出了各式各样的风味披萨，我不知道这世上有没有字面意思上「吃过所有披萨」的人，但我估计我这辈子都做不到。
所以在知道披萨种类其实非常丰富之后，我也和你一样问过同样的问题：哪种披萨最好吃？而现在其实我和工友一样只喜欢「正常披萨」，也就是那不勒斯披萨。
那不勒斯披萨从某种意义上你可以把它理解为意大利披萨的一种，它起源于意大利的那不勒斯，并且是受到了意大利官方承认和保护的饮食，类似于我们常听到的「非物质文化遗产」。而在 1984 年成立的「那不勒斯披萨认证协会（ACPN, Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana）」更是把那不勒斯披萨推…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 12 月 2 日，群晖在线上举办了名为 Synology 2022 AND BEYOND 的在线活动，和去年类似，由于疫情等诸多原因，群晖依旧选择在线上举办其发布会，相比去年 2021 年的发布会，群晖在本次线上发布会上介绍了未来的诸多软硬件更新内容，例如 DSM 7.1、C2 云服务、SRM 1.3 等，当然还正式发布了两款硬件产品，那么下面我们一起来回顾下本次线上发布会的诸多亮点和更新吧。
DSM 7.1
在过去的 2021 年，群晖正式发布了近年来其 DSM 操作系统最大的一次版本更新：DSM 7.0。全新的外观、更为安全的访问以及诸多系统新特性使得群晖 NAS 在更可靠安全的同时，也变得更为易用。而在 2022 年，群晖还会基于 DSM 7.0 推出其首个功能更新：DSM 7.1，主要聚焦在以下几个使用痛点上：
管理大规模部署
在 DSM 7.0 中，群晖发布了基于共有云的 web 端监控平台 Active Insight，你可以通过这个平台有效地了解到你的 NAS 设备的运行情况，而在 DSM 7.1 中，Active Insight 将会得到进一步的增强，比如说你可以用它来对多台设备进行大规模的集约化部署，统一管理系统更新和套件软件的更新。

同时在 Active Insight 还整合了更为智能的验证系统，可以根据使用习惯还预测并判断潜在的可疑登录，尤其是当登录地点和时间变得异常或者所有用户账户突然变成活动状态时，会及时通知 Active Insight 的管理员，并提供相对应的操作建议。

另外 Active Insight 还将加入监控 Hyper Backup 备份任务，这样对于需要管理多台设备的管理员，可以在一个界面下集中管理而无需手动检查每一台设备。进一步减少检查和管理的工作量。
带外管理功能
这项功能将基于现有运维人员操作的基础上来进…</span>

                    <span>在国内定制系统几乎都已经经历过一轮变革的 2020 年年底，横空出世的 OriginOS 虽然难免给人一种「来晚了」的感觉，彼时它所交出的答卷依然让人惊喜，而如果站在现在的角度去看当时的 OriginOS，则不难发现它在启动器布局、桌面微件（widget）和自定义风格上的改造思路和实现路径甚至还有那么几分预见性：桌面微件在 iOS 和 Android 生态内重新得到重视、个性化表达在 Android 12 中成为一大主题……
OriginOS 对启动器主屏的重构令人印象深刻
2021 年，华容网格、原子组件、变形器，这几个在 OriginOS 中让人眼前一亮并迅速成为堪称 vivo 手机标志性功能的特性，又将迎来哪些打磨和创新？
12 月 9 日刚刚亮相的 OriginOS Ocean，就像它跳出常规「版本号」框架的命名方式那样，又一次在定制系统阵营中吹起了这么一阵新风。
玩转「符号」，将系统做成一本杂志
对去年少数派发布的 OriginOS 评测还有印象的朋友，应该知道 OriginOS 当初在大刀阔斧改造 vivo 手机系统桌面启动器的同时，也留下了不少让人担心的小问题，其中最明显的自然是系统整体设计风格上的割裂：华容网格和原子组件构建的新体验需要大量的第三方适配进行支撑、变形器虽然做得非常细致但依然没有处理好一些设计细节、启动器之外的其它部分缺少与之配位的打磨和润色……
关联阅读：OriginOS 上手体验：三个概念与它们所对应的问题
归根结底，虽然 OriginOS 在华容网格、原子组件等概念上极具巧思，但它们需要一套能够将整个 OriginOS 统一起来的设计语言。在我看来，这正是 vivo 在 OriginOS Ocean 中引入符号化设计语言的原因。这套符号化设计语言的理念源自杂志，参考对象的选择依然很巧妙——和大部分需要仔细阅读、浏览的内容相似，用排版设计的…</span>

背景概述
每次我想打盹儿的时候，几乎百分百会被媳妇的电话闹醒，但是困的时候老是忘记提前给媳妇打招呼，然后就被一阵巨大的响铃给震醒，导致不愉快。很多时候连勿扰模式也忘记开，还会被其它骚扰电话和钉钉电话闹醒。
最近研究了一下 iOS 15 推出的专注模式，结合日常生活场景做了这么个快捷指令，顺便把制作方法分享一下。
功能场景说明：运行后，手动选择计划小憩时长 30 分钟或其它时长，同时设置一个 30 分钟闹钟，发送一段文字内容通过短信和微信的方式通知给媳妇，时间到了自动结束小憩专注模式，顺便响起闹钟。

懒得看文章的可以快速自取 ：我要小睡一会儿

准备内容

快捷指令
一个女朋友及其手机号码和微信好友

配置过程
设置专注模式
所有 app 都不允许通知，所有设备之间共享，就是包括 Mac 电脑以及 Apple Watch 都同步状态。

选项配置，连三分钟内第二个来电都要禁止，因为前些年用手机号注册过法人，日均十个各类骚扰电话，打不通他们大概率还会再打一次，所以必须关闭。

快捷指令取变量做信息
整体逻辑就是，打开的时候选择想要小憩的时长，然后自动化其它操作。所以，第一部分就是选择时长的指令，这块也能自己改成一个手动输入项目，选择自己想睡的时长。

然后，需要两个在短信通知中发送给媳妇的重要变量——从 X 点睡到 Y 点，即通知超过这个时间之后电话才可以被打通。
通过「日期」脚本就能获取实时时间，通过「调整日期」就可以把时间修改为结束小憩的时间。通过一个「文本」脚本即可把两个关键变量和信息文案进行整理。

注意在时间变量可以按下图配置一下，这样就可以把冗余的日期信息去除了，短信内容结果呈现就是 xx:xx。

消息发送
第一个「信息发送」脚本就不多说，第二个「微信发送」在 Mac 端是不支持的，操作方法是在手机端先用 Siri 喊一句：

微信发送「要说的话」给「具体对象名字」。

Siri 这么操作成功一次之后，在快捷指令的脚本建议里面就自动出来了可选项，然后按「信息发送」脚本一样操作即可。

其它自动化
这部分就用默认的脚本选择专注模式结束时间，以及创建闹钟基础脚本即可。

心得体会及踩坑
Mac 端和 iOS 端的脚本还是存在一些割裂和 bug，例如我在 iOS 上设置了微信发送，在 Mac 端打开了一下工程文件，手机上再打开就会默认变成了企业微信发送消息，企业微信好友没有媳妇微信然后就报错了（那说明也可以用企业微信定时来给真领导发送汇报了）。

Mac 端无法直接使用闹钟脚本，搜半天发现压根就不在候选里面，微信和企业微信也是没法直接搜到的。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70345">

                    <span>3 年前，Apple 发布了 Apple Watch Series 4，升级了更大显示屏的同时，也带来了心电图功能。然而，国行版本的手表却与它无缘 —— 倒不是说硬件不支持，而是在软件上需要适配及审核。
直到今天，Apple 在最新的 iOS 15.2 和 watchOS 8.3 系统中，终于将过审已久的心电图功能带到国行 Apple Watch 上。除了心电图之外，iOS 15.2 其实还有不少值得关注的功能，一起来看看吧。
国行 Apple Watch 支持心电图
盼望着，盼望着，心电图终于来了。只要你的手表是 Apple Watch S4 及之后的款式，在升级了 watchOS 8.3 和 iOS 15.2 之后，就可以在 iOS 设备的「健康 &gt; 浏览 &gt; 心脏」中打开它。稍等一会，Apple Watch 上便会出现心电图 App。
如果你先前已经通过各种方式开通了心电图功能，更新后不会受到影响。

要使用心电图也很简单，只需佩戴好手表后打开心电图 App，将另一只手的食指放在数码表冠上，30 秒之后就能完成检测，同时检测结果也会即时同步到 iOS 设备的健康 App 中。你可以在健康 App 中将心电图导出为 PDF 文件提供给医生作为参考。
不过需要重点注意：Apple Watch 并非专业医疗设备，心电图检测的结果只能参考，不能用于诊断心脏病等疾病。如果对检测的结果有疑问或有身体不适，还是尽快咨询医生为好。

另外值得一提的是，此次国行 Apple Watch 的心电图功能，全称为「移动心电图房颤提示软件」，且软件版本为 V1，支持检测正常心率下的房颤。而目前最新的软件版本为 V2，除了支持 V1 版本的功能外，还能够检测高心率下的房颤。

App 隐私报告可视化
在以往的 iOS 15 系统中，App 隐私报告这一功能就已经存在了。只不过彼时我们只能选择导出…</span>

Apple 推送一系列正式版系统更新
12 月 14 日，Apple 开始向旗下产品推送新一轮正式版系统。
iOS/iPadOS 15.2 新增了 Apple Music 声控方案，还包括了「App 隐私报告」与 Apple ID「数字遗产」等功能。iPhone 13 Pro 与 iPhone 13 Pro Max 用户现在可以在设置中启用微距照片控制，用于切换到超广角镜头拍摄微距照片与视频。iPadOS 15.2 允许用户将快速备忘录的触发角改为左下角。此外还包括一系列功能与错误修复。
macOS Monterey 12.1 正式上线 SharePlay 功能，并修复了播放 HDR 视频可能导致崩溃、MagSafe 充电失灵等问题。值得一提的是「通用控制」再次延期，未能在该版本上线。此外，Apple 为老机型推送了 macOS Big Sur 11.6.2 以及 macOS Catalina 安全更新 2021-008，该补丁修复了一个可以绕过 macOS 安全机制的重大问题。
HomePod 15.2 软件更新增加了荷兰语及俄语 Siri，并支持新推出的 Apple Music 声控方案。
watchOS 8.3 除隐私报告与声控方案等更新外，还带来了此前获批的 ECG 功能。Apple Watch Series 4 及以后的机型（除 Apple Watch SE 外）现可使用移动心电图房颤提示软件，单通道心电图波形与相关分类及症状都会记录在「健康」App 中。来源

比如总是被“夸”的便利店便当


好像大家对便利店盒饭总是有莫名的期待
而全家、711、罗森的便当，鸡腿、猪排、意面…
从外表看，确实让人很有食欲


这么多肉，却只卖十几块
花很少的钱，就能吃饱又吃好



“世界上竟然有这种好事儿”
当这个想法出现时
故事的走向一般都是
“果然没有这种好事儿”



2年多前，胖崽做过一次全家便当的差测评
这次我又用了大概一周的时间
吃了全家所有的便当



你们觉得这些好看的便当皮囊下
有几款藏着“好吃”的灵魂


西式口味饭

芝士猪排咖喱饭、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭、黑椒香煎猪排饭
这三款饭，无论名字还是卖相
看上去，都觉得真香
…
但眼见就一定为实吗
那我追过的cp，就不会怎么看都真的是爱
实际却根本不存在



1、芝士猪排咖喱饭

13块8
与2年前比，猪排口感有进步
虽然同样比较干，但更像“肉”了
味道依然完全不像肉，吃出了点咸味



猪排勉强能吃，咖喱真的难吃
全家，你是在画咖喱吗
颜色像咖喱，味道跟咖喱根本不相关
吃起来很奇怪，味道很复杂
有点点奶，有点点咸，完全不下饭



2、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭

15块8
这个皮，感觉应该烤箱再烤20分钟
而不是微波炉加热就能吃
唉，这是鸡腿皮，又不是脸皮
为什么我也想不要呢



本来鸡腿够大，还有甜味香肠
这款饭吃起来还挺饱，挺满足
但，饭里又加了同款怪味咖喱
这个咖喱吃起来的感觉
真的让我误会是不是加了恒河水
复杂、一言难尽



3、黑椒香煎猪排饭

12块8
啊，这猪排，真的成了精
我这凡人之躯，确实感受不出猪的原型
不知道自己在吃什么肉



但粉丝跟豆角味道还算正常
有蛋味跟油味的煎蛋
是全家盒饭里，最好的荤菜



中式口味饭

西式的饭不太行，吃吃看中式口味



1、香冒肥牛饭

14块8
来，你们看看这片肉
隔着屏幕，吃不到，是不是很难受
那我们感同身受
…
因为我看着这片肥牛
却也吃不出肥牛的味道



味道偏辣
对于广东胃来说，是非常辣
比较下饭吧



2、孜然牛肉鸡排双拼饭

奥尔良鸡肉、孜然牛肉、蛋皮、甜洋葱、胡萝卜…
聚在一起，什么都有
然后，每一款都做得不怎么样
这不是盒饭，是饭堂
即使只卖15块8，我也觉得不值



烩饭

烩饭是全家新款便当
一盒13块8
两款都比较清淡


菌菇鸡肉烩饭

味道像清鸡汤味的浓汤宝


番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭

基本就是微微的酸味
可以吃吧



面
吃完了饭，我们来吃面
一共吃了5款
包含意面、拌面、泡面、不知道什么面

其实都不用说出口
煮好，冷藏，微波炉再加热吃的面条
这是做好了，等ta，等到冷掉的饭菜
确实热热还能吃，但就是吃得不开心啊
所有的面条口感都很糟糕，大部分很软





1、奥尔良风味鸡肉意面

11块8
这盒面，要上天



“您好，这是本次航班配送的餐食”



完全就是经济舱鸡肉意面的样子跟味道
鸡肉就是飞机餐鸡肉口感
调味酸酸甜甜
只有翱翔在蓝天，才愿意下咽



2、大块鸡排京味炸酱干拌面

11块8
本来炸鸡排的口感应该是：说出“我喜欢你”前一刻的心跳
热切，跳个不停
用微波炉翻热的炸鸡排
…
是听到“对不起”后一刻的心跳
心如死灰的静
…
完全不香
京味炸酱就吃出了咸


3、港式餐蛋捞丁

这11块8，花得不值
午餐肉，薄到，我都害怕
它会从我的牙缝溜走
…
唯一的优点是捞丁用的酱
有蒜蓉，所以味道没那么单调



4、黑椒牛肉炒意面

只要9块8
所以买不了吃亏买不了上当
诶诶诶，想啥呢
不该花的钱一分不能花
这盒面，很干，还只吃出黑胡椒的冲辣



5、黑椒牛柳拌面

最好，也最贵，13块8
虽然主要也是黑胡椒味
但酱汁拌匀后，面条比较湿润，口感会好一些




总 结
分量来说，全家的盒饭
大部分一个都吃不饱



非要选的话，如果旁边没有超市快餐
饭我选番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭
面的话，嗯，不如选便利店里的车仔面


最后，发自内心地说
其实全家的便当非常适合我吃
因为社畜，就该吃些非人的食物




这次重测，一大原因是上次测评发出后的回应，让那篇测评可以归入“我找骂系列测评”。
所以这期，我先“反击”



以上纯味道评价，你可以认为好吃，但别用“加班后深夜的全家”等附加情感因素反驳我；
因为用“感情”反击，从“道理”上，就已经输了

《优待证管理办法》指出，为规范退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象优待证（简称优待证）制发、使用和服务管理，维护持证人权益，提高优待服务管理水平，依据《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》和国家有关规定，制定本办法。
《优待证管理办法》明确，优待证分为“中华人民共和国退役军人优待证”、“中华人民共和国烈士、因公牺牲军人、病故军人遗属优待证”两种，分别面向符合条件的退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象发放。优待证是持证人彰显荣誉的载体、享受优待的凭证。
据了解，2020年1月，退役军人事务部等20部门联合印发《关于加强军人军属、退役军人和其他优抚对象优待工作的意见》，提出“建立优待证制度”，逐步为退役军人和“三属”（烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属）统一制作颁发优待证。2021年1月1日起施行的《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》，将国家发放优待证写入法律。
《优待证管理办法》共9章、52条，3个部分。第一部分为总体要求，包含第一、二章，共16条。明确了优待证制发的目的依据、相关定义、适用范围、工作原则、信息支持、职责分工、功能等。
第二部分为优待证各个环节的工作要求，包含第三至八章，共32条。明确了申请、审核、制发、补换、收回、监督管理等全周期过程的要求。
第三部分为附则，即第九章，共4条。明确了遗属界定、施行时间等。（人民网记者何淼）

                    <span>一证虽小，意义非凡！！
自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。
因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。
退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： 
一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇
当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。
退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。

在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。
但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。

二、光荣的象征
 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。
 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。
对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。
三、身份的证明
 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。
 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。
 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。
四、全国通用
近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。
而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。
不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 
退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。

而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！

Nicolas Cage stars as... Nick Cage in the action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones. With a career built for this very moment, the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nick Cage.</span>

The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the universe seems empty. Devoid o…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched! And I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to come up with a game plan for where the Multiplayer should be headed from here on out. This is more or less, what I think 343i should do and prioritize for the next... however long. So check the time stamps if there&#x27;s something in particular you want to see me talk about.

                    <span>Data Structures and Algorithms are a very important topic for every beginner programmer to learn about. 
Data structures and algorithms are two terms that are often mentioned in the same sentence. In a data structure, you will find the different types of data, such as arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, and trees. What exactly are they? How do they work? How can you use them to solve real-world problems? 
To answer these questions, this article will provide 8 types of data structures and algorithms that you might encounter in your everyday life. The article starts by giving the basics for each data structure or algorithm before explaining its function. As an example for each type of data structure or algorithm, we’ve included a brief case study where it has been used.

                    <span>Context


This post is a short made-up, based on a real experience. It aims to show different approaches to developing and maintaining React components in an application.
In order to use react-select in a french government project, we have to translate placeholders and other default options. As far as I know, there is no i18n extension for react-select; anyway, it may not have fit our need since there may be some domain-specific text. Here we go, let&#x27;s use the component&#x27;s props:
 &quot;Chargement…&quot;}
  noOptionsMessage&#x3D;{() &#x3D;&gt; &quot;Aucun résultat&quot;}
  placeholder&#x3D;&quot;Choisissez une valeur&quot;
  // …
/&gt;

It works. 
👉 Now, we want to re-use this component with same options elsewhere, then everywhere else.
We could create a MySelect that has some default options. Since the only …</span>

                    <span>Written by Chiamaka Umeh ✏️
React Hooks provide us with access to core React functionalities within the context of function components. Traditionally, to optimize React, developers have had to switch between function and class components, however, React Hooks allow us to use function components throughout projects to build both small and large applications.
If you’re a React developer who likes to write function components over class components, then this article is for you; we’ll look at three helpful yet somewhat underrated React Hooks that you might not be so familiar with, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, and useDebugValue. We’ll explore their use cases, syntax, and a few code examples. Let’s get started!

                    <span>Vendure is a modern headless e-commerce framework written in TypeScript and built on top of the excellent NestJS framework.
By &quot;headless&quot; we mean that it exposes an API (GraphQL in the case of Vendure), which allows you to build your storefront using your favourite front-end technology, be it Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or anything else you like!
Headless e-commerce has a somewhat justified reputation of being more complex and development-intensive than off-the-shelf SaaS solutions like Shopify. But with Vendure we aim to cut down your development time to the bare minimum with a combination of:
a rich set of features
integrations with existing solutions
optimal developer experience
modern technologies and workflows

                    <span>Monads were created by mathematicians in 1960 and rediscovered by computer scientists in 1990 as a new way to handle effects. Let&#x27;s write some examples, imagine a function that gets the tail from a list like this:

The problem here is obvious, this function can fail if he receives an empty list, now imagine that for any reason we&#x27;re using this function in our program to work with lists and for some reason, it receives an empty list, in this case, our program will break and the language compiler will give to us an exception, so how to solve this? to solve this we can use the Maybe Monad, let&#x27;s write this:

Now we have the function safeTail which is total, which means that this function will never fail, even if receives an empty list. As you can see Maybe Monad is like a box that encapsulate…</span>

                    <span>Hi guys, this is my first post and I will help to install Neovim for MacOS. In this case, the plugins to install will be mostly backend development (Python and Go).
Personally, my primary motivation to try out Neovim was: 
Reducing load on my machine.
Have the experience of using Vim/NeoVim as my IDE.
To be curios about why Vim/Neovim is so special.
Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim source code to achieve the following goals:
Simplify maintenance to improve the speed that bug fixes and features get merged.
Split the work among multiple developers.
Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any modifications to the core source.
Improve the extensibility power with a new plugin architecture based on coprocesses. Plugins will be written in any pr…</span>

                    <span>As all those of us involved in the field of Computer Science know or should know, Git is by far the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. We utilized it in our everyday routine to keep track of our code changes and helps us to work with other developers simultaneously and independently. 

Although modern IDE and various tools provided by GitHub, Atlassian and other provide us an easy to use way to perform many git commands nothing compares to the power a terminal provides. Bellow you can find a list of my top git commands.
# This will pop up an editor window allowing us to pass the new commit message
git commit -amend 

# This will not pop up the editor
git commit -amend -m &quot;Your new commit message&quot;

# Add the file
git add the_file_you_want_to_add
# Amend without changing commit message
git commit --amend --no-edit

git reset --hard 

git cherry-pick 

git log -n 
# example git log -n 3
# or
git log -
# example git log -3

                    <span>In this articles I would like to share with you the process of development of the latest game that I developed called Cuzzle (cube + puzzle &#x3D; Cuzzle) ReactJS, this game was inspired by the original game called cuzzle developed by Redline Games
In this first part, I&#x27;m going to show you about the game and the different options it has.
In the second part, we are going to talk about the technical aspects and challenges in the development of this game.

You can play the game online here: https://cuzzle-react.vercel.app/
Cuzzle ReactJS is an isometric puzzle game, inspired by Sokoban, the 1981 transport puzzle game in which the player has to push boxes around a warehouse to get them into different locations. Cuzzle ReactJS add collapsing floors, switches, and some nice graphics.

                    <span>These last days, I tried to send an SMS with a Guile script.
Since the code is just a simple HTTP POST request, the longest part should have been the creation of the Twilio account (with a Regulatory Bundle and a phone number).
But in the end, it took me about one evening[1] to set up a development environment with the right dependencies, and then two more evenings to figure out which HTTP headers were needed.
Anyway, here is the script:

                    <span>Data Science is a growing field that has made it possible to extract meaningful information from data. Data scientists need programming languages in order to have the necessary tools for their job. In this blog post, we will talk about the best programming languages for data science and why they are so important!
R Language
Python
C++
Java
Wolfram Language
R, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.
Data science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code. These two languages are used by over half of all Fortune 500 companies so they&#x27;re worth getting acquainted with!

Shortery：Mac 上的快捷指令自动化工具

平台：macOS
关键词：快捷指令、自动化

@huhuhang：快捷指令作为 iPhone 上出色的效率应用，终于在今年被 Apple 带到 Mac 平台。从长期来看，快捷指令也大有替代 Mac 原本的 Automator 的趋势。当然，由于 iOS 和 macOS 平台的属性不同，快捷指令在二者中的功能也不完全一致，并非简单的移植。例如你可以从菜单栏和访达中快速访问 Mac 版本的快捷指令，同时又缺失了 iOS 版本具有的自动化功能。

虽然官方尚未在 Mac 版的快捷指令中添加自动化触发选项，但第三方应用 Shortery 正好可以弥补这点不足。

Shortery 提供了七种不同的触发器来运行快捷指令：

应用程序启动和退出：当你启动或退出一个应用程序时运行快捷指令。
时间：设置快捷指令运行的时间，并定义它的重复频率。
唤醒和睡眠：在你的 Mac 进入睡眠或醒来后运行快捷指令。
登录：用户登录时触发，开始全新的一天。
键盘：定义一个全局热键并从任何应用程序中触发它。
外观：当你的 Mac …</span>

                    <span>「互联网正在着火」？
如果你多少关注信息安全资讯，或许在最近几天已经频繁听到 Log4Shell 这个漏洞的名字——或者一些更具传播性的说法，诸如「互联网正在着火」「过去十年最严重的漏洞」「现代计算机历史上最大漏洞」「难以想到哪家公司不受影响」之类（参见《洛杉矶时报》，12 月 10 日）。

这个被报道得神乎其神的 Log4Shell 漏洞（CVE-2021-44228）所针对的，是一个极为常用的 Java 库 Log4j（详见后文说明）。值得一提，这个漏洞最初是由一名中国工程师、阿里云安全团队的 Chen Zhaojun（微博）在 11 月下旬发现并提报的。
有记录的利用 Log4Shell 漏洞发起的攻击开始于 12 月 9 日，最初是针对微软的 Minecraft 游戏 Java 版。但人们很快发现 Log4Shell 的波及范围远不止于此。根据 GitHub 仓库 YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface 中的攻击案例截图，Apple iCloud、QQ 邮箱、Steam 商店、Twitter、百度搜索等一系列国内外主流服务或平台均存在该漏洞。

好在，Log4j 已经于 12 日发布 2.15.0 版本，修复了漏洞，并且对于暂不能升级的旧版提供了临时应对方案。
受影响的大型平台也作出快速响应。10 日，Minecraft 发布 1.18.1 版，说明已修复了漏洞；亚马逊发出安全警告称，「正积极监控该问题，并已在寻求解决方案」；IBM、Red Hat、甲骨文、VMware 等知名科技公司也宣称正在部署补丁；Apple 尽管没有官方回应，但根据 11 日的测试，原本受到影响的 iCloud 似乎也已经修复。此外，目前暂无因该漏洞导致重大安全事故的报道。
然而，由于该漏洞影响范围之广，受影响服务完成更新或修补仍需不少时间，因此近期内风险仍不可忽视。事…</span>

                    <span>不论是患者还是家属，对重症监护病房（ICU）那道厚厚的门档充满了恐惧，ICU 常被描述为「有去无回」的地方，现实中的「人间地狱」。在很多人的眼里，ICU 中各种生命支持设备维持下的患者是没有「灵魂」的，ICU 的医护人员是没有「人情」的，要问整个医院中最没有人文关怀的科室，ICU 必定站上榜首。
作为一名 ICU 医生，希望能通过这篇文章，带大家一起了解现代医疗下的 ICU 是怎样的一个地方。
重症监护病房的历史
ICU 在整个现代医学的发展中属于一股新生力量，在 1950 年左右，为了拯救脊髓灰质炎导致呼吸衰竭的患者，才出现第一批具有现代医学意义上的 ICU 雏形。随着医疗技术的逐步发展，才在之后的数十年中逐步创立了重症监护病房。而中国第一个 ICU 病房则是在 1982 年于北京协和医院设立的，创建之初是只有 1 张床位的外科ICU，之后的 2 年，才创立了拥有 7 张床的 ICU 中心，从此开启了中国重症监护医学的元年。
在创立之初，由于患者需要大量的麻醉治疗、呼吸机治疗等方面的支持，ICU 大部分医生是由麻醉医生构成的，此时的ICU更多扮演着麻醉科附属科室的角色。随着 2003 年严重呼吸系统综合征 SARS、2005 年禽流感、2008 年汶川地震等重大公共卫生安全事件的相继爆发，大量危重症患者需要 ICU 的支持治疗，使得重症医学迅速发展壮大，2009 年正式认定为临床医学的二级学科，成为中国现代医学重要的组成部分。

经过接近一个月的开发工作，Switshot 2.0 版本终于正式地与大家见面。
相较于「简陋」的 Switshot 1.x 版本，Switshot 2.0 可以说是完全重构的版本。不仅在 1.x 版本中出现的诸多问题被统一修复，新版本还新增快捷指令功能，并为之后的媒体管理增强功能打下基础。
首先，介绍一下 Switshot
Nintendo Switch 11.0.0 固件更新为 Nintendo Switch 带来「发送至智能手机」功能。这个功能本质上是在 Switch 上启动一个 WLAN 热点和一个 Web 服务器，让手机连接到热点并访问服务器的资源（截屏和录制）。但是这个功能并没有想象中那么好用：除了需要扫描两次 QR 码之外，它将截屏和录制保存到手机上的方式也很原始：给你一个网页，让你长按保存……
老任啊，你这个发送功能，是来搞笑的吗？
后来，有人做了一款 Android app，可以直接读取 Switch 发送过来的媒体列表然后直接保存。对老任这个传输网页进行一点点 inspect 工作，发现 Switch 实际上会提供一个 JSON 列表，列表中包括在 Switch 中传过来的文件地址。
那么，下面就是「我上我也行」时间。我当即做了一个 快捷指令，自动读取 JSON 列表然后保存到图库。
最开始做 Switshot 非常机缘巧合：它是我做另外一款 app、等待 App Store 审核期间花半天时间摸出来的玩意，目的和上面提到的 app 和快捷指令一样：只需要扫一次码，就能一次性地把媒体保存起来。之后，我收到身边朋友…</span>

严重远程代码执行漏洞影响国内外大型公司服务
12 月 10 日，一个旧版 Apache Log4j 2 远程代码执行漏洞细节被公开。Log4j 是一个用来记录日志信息的 Java 框架，被大量项目用于业务系统开发。该漏洞利用了 Log4j 对日志内容的递归解析功能，使得攻击者无需特殊配置即可直接构造恶意请求，触发远程代码执行漏洞，漏洞利用。受到影响的服务包括微软的 Minecraft 游戏、亚马逊的 AWS 云服务多项功能，Apple iCloud 以及国内的百度搜索、QQ 邮箱等服务经测试亦受影响。

目前 Apache Log4j 官方已发布安全通告（CVE-2021-44228），并发布 Log4j 2.15.0 版本，对主要引发漏洞的 JNDI 功能强化默认安全设置，从而修复了漏洞，并针对旧版提出了补救建议，但受影响厂商完成更新或修补预计仍需时间。来源

                    <span>大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。
非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。
我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。
首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。



其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~

厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。

对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。
最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～

                    <span>如此有价值的一个问题不光没几个人答，而且先前仅有的两个回答居然都在胡说八道……这不能忍，怒答一发。
羽毛球世界杯赛的“停办”在历史上一共有两次，一次是1997-2005的暂时停办，一次就是2006年后至今的无限期永久停办，而这两次停办背后的原因其实是完全不同的。
这项赛事最初的举办是在1981年——那一年的另外一个重大历史事件就是原国际羽联IBF和原世界羽联WBF正式合并成新的国际羽联IBF（也就是现在我们熟悉的新世界羽联BWF的前身），而它的首次停办是在1997年，这期间一共举办了17次比赛，但可能出乎很多人常识认知范畴之外的是，这17次比赛的主办方其实并不是世界羽联IBF，而是总部位于美国纽约的国际管理集团IMG。

由此我们也可以得知，1997年的羽毛球世界杯赛停办，其背后的根本原因应当是由于作为主办方的IMG集团内部的业务变更与项目调整，尽管具体的情况目前已不得而知，但可以想见国际羽联对于这次停办的话语权应当不是很大的。
然而新世纪以来在湖南益阳分别于2005年和2006年举办的第18和第19届世界杯赛的情况以及世界杯赛在那之后的第二次停办，其背后的原因则与前文所述大相径庭。

首先不同于以往的是，这两届世界杯赛事的重启已经不再经过原本作为赛事主办方的IMG集团的点头，而是在当时由国际羽联IBF方面自行牵头、并同时联合我国的一些大型国有企业与地方私营企业（譬如中国移动和赛琪体育等）进行合作规划从而最终得以实现的，同时在性质上也被重新认定是不计世界排名积分的“邀请赛”——尽管从届数上这两次比赛仍按第18、19届世界杯进行顺延，也就是名义上仍继承了此前于1997年停办的老世界杯赛的衣钵，但由于整个比赛重启之后一直带着一股抹不去的“非正式赛事”的味道，因此在公众看来其在此后进行常态化办赛的前景始终是不明朗的。
其次也是最主要的一点就是这两届“新世界杯”的赛制与赛事性质的定…</span>

Usually people search for patterns to follow but some of them are searching for the anti-patterns to avoid, In my opinion both are equally important, as by knowing them you are leveling up your skills in programming using a specific tool.
To understand what are the anti-patterns we need first to define what is a pattern. a pattern is usually a well known solution for a recurring problem, or we can first talk about the concept through a food metaphor.
This plate (for people who don&#x27;t know) is a street Egyptian food called &quot;Koshary&quot;, I picked it because it has quite a lot of ingredients including rice, pasta, hummus, lentil, tomato sauce, and more.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re just getting started with data science, then Python programming is a great language to start with. It&#x27;s the most popular programming language for data scientists and it has many powerful packages, libraries and frameworks that are designed specifically for their needs. In this post, we&#x27;ll take a look at some of the best tools out there - so read on if you want to get up-to-speed quickly!
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides an efficient and comprehensive array-processing facility that can handle large multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy also contains high-level mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and other operations.

                    <span>First, create a new project.
CD into the project folder and run npm init. Follow those steps until you&#x27;re done.
Run: npm i mongodb. This will install the official MongoDB driver for Node.
Create an index.js, or main.js, depending on your main file when you ran npm init.
Inside there: add this:
const {MongoClient} &#x3D; require(&quot;mongodb&quot;);
const mongouri &#x3D; &#x27;mongodb://your_connection_string&#x27;;
const client &#x3D; new MongoClient(mongouri);

client.connect().then(console.log(&quot;Connected to MongoDB&quot;));

Congrats, if you run node ., you should see &#x27;Connected to MongoDB&#x27;.
Let&#x27;s create a quick question database by using an asynchronous function. Add this above client.connect().then(console.log(&quot;Connected to MongoDB&quot;)); and under the constants:

My player has a fraction of the functionalities a player like Youtube has, and yet I was already drowning in endless &quot;pages&quot; of events.
Next.js / React.js


Mostly because is what I&#x27;m used to... and since I&#x27;m using React, no reason not to go with Next, even though I&#x27;m not actually using anything it offers.
Chakra UI


I love the developer experience of Chakra UI. I mean... what&#x27;s more intuitive than fontSize&#x3D;{[1em&#x27;, &#x27;1.2em&#x27;, &#x27;1.5em&#x27;]} to handle breakpoint values?

                    <span>After going through the material here, you would&#x27;ve learned a lot about Blockchain and What it is all about. Let&#x27;s dive in 🚀.
A Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger network that is cryptographically secured.
Think of it as a database where different features can be built on such as coins, apps etc and no single entity has control over it. This allows for transparency, security and gives everyone full control of their assets.
We have 3 major types of networks in computing, they are:

In a centralized network, all the data and information is regulated by a single entity. Example Facebook, WhatsApp etc they are all centralized.
In a decentralized network, different nodes on the network have equally control and the source of Truth is checked on the network to ensure that everyone …</span>

                    <span>Podemos identificar padrões em uma cadeia de caracteres usando Expressões Regulares (Regular Expression ou RegEx).
Para validar o formato de um CPF, por exemplo, é necessário que esteja no seguinte padrão:
xxx.xxx.xxx-xx (cada x corresponde à um dígito decimal)
Então através de uma RegEx conseguimos identificar se esse padrão foi seguido ou não.
Usando a linguagem de programação Python, importa-se o módulo re que fornece operações de expressões regulares.
import re

Cria-se uma função validar a qual recebe uma string cpf, ela retorna válido ou inválido.
def validar(cpf):
    validador &#x3D; expressao.match(cpf)
    if validador:
        return &#x27;válido&#x27;
    return &#x27;inválido&#x27;

                    <span>For release 0.4, I decided to take the the time to participate in the 2021 GitHub Action hackathon and continue to contribute to Telescope.
About the same time we worked on integrating GitHub Continuous Integration into our SSG project, GitHub announced they are holding 2021 GitHub Action hackathon in collaboration with Dev. This year, we’re encouraged to utilize existing GitHub Actions to create workflows solutions other developers can utilize to solve problems with open source. My submission was a workflow to run code linter and formatter on only changed files and run test on only changed workspaces of a monorepo. I used what learned from building an SSG in OSD600 to build this project. After all, I walked away having a deeper understanding of GitHub actions, from exploring many existing actions, to building a useful one and publishing it to GitHub marketplace.
The other contributions were for improving website accessibility and responsiveness in Telescope. These fixed some of the minor issues I encountered while using Telescope myself.

                    <span>Do you want to perform sentiment analysis with Python but don&#x27;t know how to get started? Not to worry. In this article, I&#x27;ll demonstrate and explain how you can make your own sentiment analysis app, even if you are new to Python.
If you&#x27;ve been following programming and data science, you&#x27;ll probably be familiar with sentiment analysis. If you&#x27;re not, here the definition:
The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer&#x27;s attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
Sentiment analysis programs have become increasingly popular in the tech world. It&#x27;s time you make one for yourself!

                    <span>One of the major challenges in software engineering is documentation. After all, software is not only about code but the documentation that comes with it. It is a manual, costly process which should be human legible and comprehensible.
So why is documentation so important ? 
In this blog we will talk about some of the ways we can document code functionality in Python. 
Since Python is a dynamically typed language, coding modules for example a piece of code for a function can take any parameter values without any validations or checks. In some cases, the function name and parameters may be self-explanatory but how the parameters and function work may be unknown unless the code is read which can contain large number of complexities.Therefore having documentation on inputs and outputs of a fu…</span>

We are trying to build an alarm clock that will call users and solve a riddle. It&#x27;d not cut the call unless they got it correct. But there is a chance of saying no if they don&#x27;t want to wake up at that point. This blog will be vast if I complete the full features.

Npm (for installing packages)
Express js (For the API development) 
Ejs (templating language for HTML)
TailwindCSS (for styling)
Dasha (for making alarm clock interesting with the help of conversational AI)
Vscode (code editor)

                    <span>Windows 沙盒是内置于 Windows 部分版本中的一次性 Windows 虚拟机，它简单免费，启动速度快，并且用完即删。在需要使用不适合安装在实体机器上的应用、亦或者测试安全性未知的文件时，Windows 沙盒都是非常实用的工具。
然而，和真正的虚拟机相比，它的自定义空间「似乎」很小：沙盒默认屏蔽了摄像头和打印机，如此一来部分应用就无法运行；想要在沙盒中安装软件要么从主机复制安装包，要么再次下载；由于沙盒是一次性的，有用的文件还要在销毁沙盒前手动复制进主机……
幸运的是，以上问题都能通过专属于 Windows 沙盒的配置文件解决。Windows 沙盒配置文件为纯文本，后缀名 .wsb，可以用于定义沙盒的 vGPU 状态、网络信号、文件夹映射等属性。下文将通过三个具体实例演示配置文件的使用方法。最后一节会列出所有可用配置项供大家参考。
Windows 沙盒的开启方法请参考此文：

Windows 10 五月更新即将推送，浅色模式、沙盒和新的搜索功能都要来了

用例一：允许沙盒应用使用摄像头，临时运行视频会议应用
让我们从最简单的例子开始讲起，介绍配置文件的新建和使用流程。
假设我们需要在沙盒中运行一个视频会议软件，默认情况下，鉴于一些安全问题，沙盒屏蔽了应用对摄像头的访问。因而下面我们需要配置沙盒允许视频输入。

在桌面通过右键新建一个文本文件。确保你能看到该文件的后缀名 .txt。如果看不到，需要勾选 文件资源管理器 &gt; 查看（顶部） &gt; 显示 &gt; 文件扩展名。

双击此文件进入编辑界面。输入：

 Enable


沙盒的配置文件非常好理解，字母大小写任意，结构类似俄罗斯套娃：最外面一层   …</span>

                    <span>每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。
当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。
总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……

作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。
从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。

大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。
锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。

然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。
早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？
据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。

其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。
以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。

在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！

                    <span>The Vision, which was often carefully cleaned with flannel, had once been taken away from Arataki Itto.
But Itto has never been discouraged. On the contrary, after overcoming various hardships to regain his elemental power, his fighting spirit has burned even brighter.
Yes, that&#x27;s right. I guess his mettle is exactly what makes him the boss of the Arataki Gang.

                    <span>One thing I&#x27;ve seen across many designer/design studio websites are a cool custom cursor in place of your default computer one. Recently, I added one to my website aswell.
I had to write one from scratch (using some internet resources of course!), since all the NPM libraries I found were either outdated, or didn&#x27;t support SSR.
After adding the cursor to my own website, I had an idea to create an NPM package for it for a while. This weekend, I had some freetime from school &amp; got to work!
This library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js &amp; Remix)
Want a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak &amp; experiment around with values!
To download the library, head over to your terminal:
yarn add custom-pointer-react

Next, import the cursor component into your file &amp; customise it! Don&#x27;t forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.
import { Cursor } from &#x27;custom-pointer-react&#x27;
...
const Cursor &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    ...
    
    ...
  )
}
...
export default App

All parameters are optional, &amp; here&#x27;s a list of the different parameters which you can customise: 



Parameter
Description
Default




color
The background colour of the cursor
#000000


showRing
Controls whether to show the ring around the cursor
true


ringSize
Controls the size of the ring around the cursor
50px


cursorSize
Controls the size of the cursor
10px


ringBorder
Controls the width of the ring&#x27;s border
2px



Need help finding the right parameters? Check out the demo website!
Now, go into your app &amp; import the MouseContext provider.
import { MouseContextProvider } from &#x27;custom-pointer-react&#x27;
...
ReactDOM.render(
  
    
  ,
  document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)
)
...

Your custom cursor should be good to go!</span>

                    <span>Integrations play a huge role in communicating across different services. In this guide, we&#x27;ll build a marketing analytical dashboard with Twitter and Youtube integrations. This dashboard can be used to track stats across both platforms in a single view. 
We&#x27;re looking to build something like this 👇

We&#x27;ll be using:
React for building the frontend.
Blueprint as our UI Library
Backend template from Canonic
GraphQL for fetching the data.
React-chartjs-2 for building charts.
Step 1: Getting started with the project
To create the project, we&#x27;ll use create-react-app. Execute the command below in a terminal to create the basic boilerplate setup. We&#x27;ll name our project marketing-dashboard.
npx create-react-app marketing-dashboard

                    <span>A new commit was made to the ParseJS repository, it contains an update that will prevent smaller tokens from potentially wrongfully being placed.
This is the bug in question:
parse_string(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, [&quot;Hell&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;]);
// Produces: [Symbol(Hell), &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, ...]

// But, this--
parse_string(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hell&quot;]);
// -- produces: [Symbol(Hello), &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;, ...]

Now, in this update, the order won&#x27;t matter, the longer token is always chosen if it can be.</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t write much about Angular but as I am working on a project that uses Angular at the moment I thought why not share a thing or two that I found interesting.
As someone who is definitely not an Angular expert I was looking for a clean solution on how to listen for element events that are part of a child component&#x27;s template.
This is of course quite a trivial thing but it might be of value to people who are starting with Angular and are facing the same problem.
Let&#x27;s start.
Situation:
We want to listen to child component input element&#x27;s events inside of the parent component. (do something with it in the parent)
Parent template code: (parent.component.html)

Child template code: (child.component.html)

                    <span>Hi Devs,
This is sort of new for me. I&#x27;ve never really been a business guy - more the kind of dude that just codes away behind the scenes - but I&#x27;ve been working on a really cool project and thought it fit to show the community. We also hit #1 on Hacker News, so I figured there was a fair bit of crossover :-)
Short description
1SecondPainting is an artificial intelligence art generator that lets people create their own, stunning quality paintings in seconds.  You can then purchase canvas prints, framed posters, or digital downloads (for NFTs). Every painting sold is 100% unique - you&#x27;re in full control of your art.
I combined some pretty cutting edge ML with a proprietary post-processing pipeline to deliver probably the highest quality art of this kind (in my opinion, though of course I&#x27;m biased).
A lot of people have called it unsettling &amp; kind of scary, which I agree with! If you&#x27;re interested, you can try it for yourself here. Let me know what you think :)
Thanks,
Nick</span>

It is coded with Go and it is available on my GitHub: https://github.com/antsanchez/go-download-web 
I normally use it to: 
Back up any website (at least the rendered part of the website)
Create copies of websites for accessing them offline
It also allows you to change the URL of the downloaded website, which can be very helpful when moving an existing static website from a domain to another. 
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

                    <span>In the process of setting up the development environment for Nuvolaris, I decided to switch from virtual machines to containers, leveraging the devcontainer feature of VSCode. Then I built a Docker image that is a perfect fit for our needs: there everything is in it to build our project.
But, I almost went on panic when I realized that, since a key component is an operator, and a cli that interacts with Kubernetes, we need to be able to access a Kubernetes cluster for development FROM a container.
In my initial plans, I would have setup a cluster Kubernetes in the virtual machine itself. But now, that everything is in a container?

                    <span>故事要從 Python 的語言特性說起，因為 Python 是動態型別的，所以一個在同一個區塊（命名空間）內的變數 x，可以一下是字串，一下是整數：
x &#x3D; 4
print(type(4)) # at this moment, x points to an integer

x &#x3D; &quot;Hello, world&quot;
print(type(x)) # and at this moment, x points to a string

這樣的特性降低了 Python 的學習曲線，但在程式專案變複雜後，對於「值」與「型態」的掌握會越來越難以駕馭。
大約在 Python 3.5 起引入了 type hints，華文叫類型提示或型態提示，它讓我們得以聲明變數的型態，也可以聲明函式回傳值的型態。
有了 type hints，IDE 或是靜態分析工具就可以幫助我們偵測型態上的錯誤，也因為它只是 hints，所以它終究無法讓 Python 變成靜態型別語言，只是一種輔助而已。
下面是最基本的 type hints 範例：
name: str &#x3D; &quot;world&quot;

def greeting(name: str) -&gt; str:
    return &quot;Hello &quot; + name

greeting(name)

上面我們用 : str 聲明 name 為字串，以及在函式我們用 -&gt; str 聲明 greeting() 回傳的也是字串，當然還有更複雜的用法，可以參見〈Python Type Hints 從入門到實踐〉。
以上為前情提要，下面開始談本文的主角 Pydantic 。
Pydantic 是以 type hints 為基礎，幫我們做資料型態驗證的套件，我們可以用它定義「Model」：
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EmployeeModel(…</span>

年末囤货是广大人民群众喜闻乐见的一种娱乐形式，「双十一」的网购热潮还没完全消退，各大电商平台就已经纷纷开始为即将到来的「双十二」开启预热了。谈及两大购物节优惠力度最大的商品品类，笔记本电脑绝对是绕不过的话题。近年来，主流品牌的「静坐战争」、供应链的极尽成熟和 AMD Ryzen 处理器的强势崛起为众多非传统笔电厂商的入局创造了条件，因 COVID-19 新冠疫情防治工作而催生的居家办公和网课教育等专业需求则有力的推动了笔记本电脑的技术进步和市场细分，日薄西山的笔电行业竟在一夜之间「垂死病中惊坐起」，然而「铁马冰河入梦来」的滚滚矿潮很快将显卡乃至固态硬盘等核心硬件的缺货荒蔓延到了笔电市场，在市场价格与用户需求持续走高的大环境下，电商平台的年末大促俨然成了各大厂商的主战场，至于如何在这片战场上长驱直入和全身而退就成了用户需要考虑的问题。
想要购买到一台让自己心仪的笔记本电脑，在按下「立刻购买」前需要做的准备工作无外乎理清需求、估计预算、比较规格和确认细节，而在实际选购的过程中，以上四点中的前两者为必要条件，后两者则为充分条件。考虑到现在的笔电产品在目标价位和硬件规格上的表现相对直观，所以本文将从容易受到忽视的产品定位和设计细节进行筛选，本着宁缺毋滥的原则，为少数派们推荐一些称心好用的笔电产品。

                    <span>Intro


Learning how to use cloud servers and utilizing cloud computing is one of the must-have skills in current-day software development. There are plenty of options when it comes to cloud service providers, for example, Heroku, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services etc. Today, I am going to show how to spin up a cloud server on AWS, one of the most popular options and is used by many software companies.
First of all, AWS is very complicated and it has many tools that you will never need to use. For the purpose of just hosting a cloud server, we are going to focus on the tool AWS EC2.
Prerequisite: Make sure you already have an AWS account (duh)
Step1: Login to AWS and search EC2 and create an instance
Once you logged in to AWS, you are very likely to get lost from all of its options and …</span>

                    <span>What is Federated Learning


Federated learning is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.
Horizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples. For example, two regional banks may have very different user groups from their respective regions, a…</span>

It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve written on DEV.to but here I am again :)
GitHub Copilot is one of the most discussed matters in programming universe nowadays and I&#x27;ve finally got my hands on it.
During the time I&#x27;ve spent testing this awesome miracle I&#x27;ve thought about many things simultaneously and once I was thinking straight again I got frightened. It is a strange feeling how much programming has evolved since the days I&#x27;ve begun to program, how much the tools advanced, how much the frameworks and libraries became more efficient and made programming more enjoyable and easier. But then comes this revolutionary revolution! I know there were other AI code assistants before GitHub&#x27;s Copilot but this one is really something else.

Deciding a use case you want to predict or know more about.
The objective is the first step which is decided based on business requirements.
Defining the objective sheds light on what kind of data should be gathered. It also helps us in judging what kind of observations are important while doing exploratory data analysis.

In this article, I will go through the step-by-step process of how you can automate your Laravel app deployment on a VPS, for free of course.
I am a part of a small team working on a Laravel project which is deployed on a VPS. Each of our team members will work on a particular task and when it&#x27;s ready for production there is always a need for someone access to the server to deploy each change that is being pushed to our GitHub repo.
This become a very repetitive and unpleasant task for all of us and a solution was needed within our scale and budget, that&#x27;s when we turned to the mighty Github Actions to automate our workflows.
Let&#x27;s dive into the simplified version of our workflow setup guide.

                    <span>Adding CSS To Your HTML


For beginners … very picture heavy since CSS is such a visual discipline!
### Getting CSS Into Your HTML
To connect your CSS sheet to your HTML page, use the link tag like so.
Many developers use External pre-written CSS stylesheets for consistent design.
You can connect multiple stylesheets.
CSS Selector : Applies styles to a specific DOM element(s), there are various types:
Type Selectors : Matches by node name.
-   Class Selectors : Matches by class name.
-   ID Selectors : Matches by ID name.
-   Universal Selectors : Selects all HTML elements on a page.
-   Attribute Selectors : Matches elements based on the prescence or value of a given attribute. (i.e. a[title] will match all a elements with a title attribute)

Along the way, SRE engineers have become one of the most sought after engineering roles in tech. 
The role is traditionally understood as ensuring that services are reliable and unbroken, but reliability and uptime aren’t perfect metrics. Perhaps what organizations should be asking themselves is what their customers think of their service.

                    <span>What is SaaS?
SaaS, or Software as a service, alongside IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service), maybe a way of cloud-computing service delivery, where clients buy software, hosted on a foreign server, per each use or subscribers on a monthly or a yearly basis. There are three storage modes: public-cloud — when infrastructure is hosted by third-party data centers, private-cloud — within the companies network, and hybrid — a mixed approach.
The popularity of SaaS has been growing for thirty years. It appeared within the 70-is because computers were huge and very expensive, and many companies couldn&#x27;t afford to possess one. At that point, it had been called the &quot;time-sharing system&quot;- an early sort of the web as we all know it today. Within the next 20 years, despi…</span>

                    <span>In this post, we will create an SVG donut chart with clickable slices/parts. I will first explain the problem with the common way to implement an SVG donut chart (using stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset). 
stroke-dasharray implementation


Salomone Baquis talks about this in this post. This method uses the stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties to draw a slice of border around SVG circles. Read the post to see how he do it.
The problem is that we can&#x27;t interact we the slices. For example, we can&#x27;t change the color of the slice on hover or do something when the slice is clicked. 
z-index hides all the other elements below it. Have a look at the illustration below, and pay attention to the ID of the circle that is highlighted (42).

本周话题：元宇宙会成功吗
前不久，脸书的老板扎克伯格接受专访。
记者提问，为啥你们公司要改名为 Meta（元宇宙）？

记者的言下之意是，元宇宙这么虚幻的东西，科幻小说家炮制出来的概念。改成这个名字，你们会不会是一时头脑发热，追求时髦，能做成功吗？

扎克伯格的回答很棒，没有说外交辞令，而是说了两个很实在的理由，表明他认真算计过成功的可能性。
他说，根据统计，大多数美国成年人每天看电视（包括流媒体）或者玩电子游戏的时间，长达几个小时。电视节目或电子游戏，本质上都是提供了一个虚拟世界，让观众和玩家脱离现实，感受到快乐。
这表明人们愿意在虚拟世界里面，每天待上几个小时，哪怕现在的体验还非常初级。

第二个理由是，疫情期间，许多人都在家办公。以前，上班的目的地是办公室，现在变成了键盘和显示器。
这表明，人们可以在计算机前面工作8小时。如果能够提供更好的虚拟办公条件，这8小时完全可以在虚拟空间里面度过。

扎克伯格的结论就是，人们愿意待在虚拟世界，进行娱乐和工作。 元宇宙的需求真实存在，而且这种需求很大，只要能够创造更好的体验，就会诞生一个空前的市场。

我被扎克伯格说动了，突然意识到，虚拟世界真的很受欢迎，这是元宇宙可能成功的最大原因。
甚至可以这么说，如果我们把虚拟世界等同于元宇宙，那么可以发现，元宇宙早就成功了。
西游记是元宇宙。
星球大战是元宇宙。…</span>

                    <span>写在前面：

笔者对本作的体验覆盖了游戏首发至今的各版本，本文对游戏内容的描述基于最新的 1.31 版本；
本文包含情节、机制上的完全剧透，不建议未通关的玩家直接阅读；另外本文还包含了对剧集《真探 第一季》、小说集《猎魔人 - 命运之剑》中短篇小说《别的东西》的部分剧透，请酌情阅读相关文段；
本文的探讨仅围绕游戏内容，其产品宣传、不同平台质量差异等游戏外因素，均不属于本文涉及的范围；
由于笔者判断本作的中文翻译存在一些精准性问题，部分情况下可能遗漏、曲解英文表意，故下文涉及任务名称等处将优先使用英文。

相信对不少和笔者一样玩家来说，作为《巫师（The Witcher）》游戏系列的爱好者，在开启《赛博朋克 2077（Cyberpunk 2077）》（以下简称《2077》）的体验前，可能多多少少都抱着与对前者类似的预期。
关联阅读：风口浪尖上的 CDPR 和《赛博朋克 2077》，到底怎么了？
然而与期待大相径庭是，《2077》展现给玩家的将是比《巫师》更加直白、更加复合、更加深刻，甚至是更加苦涩的情绪体验。
断断续续差不多一年的游玩之后，在《2077》满周岁的这个档口，笔者终于完成了此文，试图从游戏的机制、流程、情绪传达等方面入手，探讨《2077》如何带给玩家一段美丽而永不消逝、令人难以忘怀的体验。

如同游戏标题所昭示的，本作的故事主要发生在近未来的公元 2077 年，核心舞台是公司资本浇筑而成的超级都会「夜之城（Night City）」，在这个时代缩影般的一方天地里，玩家将扮演野心勃勃的佣兵 V，尝试扎根夜之城，最终，在自我价值实现、牵扯进公司阴谋、生命进入倒计时、与强尼·银手（Johnny Silverhand）建立起微妙关系等经历交织的漩涡中，踩出一条属于自己的出路。

                    <span>简单谈一谈个人的看法。
电影里的励志、鸡汤，其本身都不是原罪。重要的是，作品的励志与鸡汤是否真正地站在真实性的基础之上。只有客观而忠实地反映了真实，作品才有了励志与鸡汤的基本说服力。
《雄狮少年》，不是完全彻底的励志向作品，而它给出的真实反映水平，也是“不完全”的：拥有了对真实表象的呈现，却未能走到表象之下。理想与现实，传统文化与当代社会，精神信仰与物质压力，一系列的冲突，也就此停留在了“足够客观的表象展现”程度上。表象客观全面，已经在同类、国产作品里颇为少有，可称“不错”；而缺乏深度细化，则阻碍了它向更优秀之处的攀登脚步，必须报以一声“遗憾”。

这部作品的第一组镜头，便强化了自身的现实属性。在旁白的介绍里，舞狮是中国传统文化的象征存在，代表着曾经时代的光辉。然而，随着一句“主角却不是他”，就将现实的时代做了切换——一个长镜头跟随着骑车的男主角，扫过了破落的农村街景，以及衣衫褴褛的民众，让当代社会的时态呈现出来。曾经以舞狮为骄傲的传统时光已经不复存在，取而代之的，是在物质压力下被迫的生存之道，经济落后地区的家庭为了赚钱，家长只能背井离乡，去大城市打工，而诞生无数的留守家庭。
包括此时出现的主角形象，都在强调着现实的因素。他不是动漫主角常有的大眼美男，而是生活里比较普遍的单眼皮少年，其后，这种形象也延伸到了女主角扁塌的鼻梁上。这样的形象，让人物彻底回归了现实感最强的“普通”之中——他没有任何突出的地方，外形都如此平庸，也就不具备所谓的“被选中之子”之类的潜藏天赋。
而主角随后的遭遇，更是让这个信息有了更明确的落地。心怀舞狮憧憬的他，被称为病猫。而抢走他红包的舞狮队成员，一方面体现着舞狮这样的传统文化于物质化当代的变质，同时也反过来说明了舞狮衰落的原因——忙于赚钱的人们，不再对舞狮这样的东西抱有兴趣，这便让历史悠久的陈家村舞狮队，也丧失了自己本应具有的骄傲，物质功利了起来，以…</span>

                    <span>再平凡的菜
都值得被“包”起来
东北贼顶饿的大包子，老~老~老~香了。
在江浙沪，包子似点心，生煎、小笼、灌汤包，脸上写着小巧、精致和娇滴滴；





在东北，包子继承了东北菜量大、实惠的特色，变得狂放不羁，不仅大大大，馅料的花样更是多了去了：从普普通通的白菜猪肉、韭菜鸡蛋，到稍稍奇特的酸菜油滋、红烧排骨，再到奢华的虾仁海肠、龙虾帝王蟹，仿佛啥都能往包子里包。
流淌着东北基因的大包子，以无所不“包”的姿态，承包下了东北人的胃。



每一个东北包子里
都包得下一盘菜
但凡能上桌的，一多半的菜都能被东北人包进包子里。



无论是绿油油的韭菜鸡蛋，还是油汪汪的酸菜白肉，哪怕是红烧排骨、大龙虾这种硬货，都是东北包子馅料的选项。


大菜包能有多少花样？
东北人对蔬菜有着非常庞大的定义，不是肉肉的，都算蔬菜家族。
但对于菜包子的定义来说，就没那么精准了。馅料全是蔬菜的，是菜包子；但以蔬菜为主，肉来增香的，也可以算进菜包子。





韭菜包、白菜包、酸菜包、大头菜包、茴香包和萝卜包、豆腐包等等，都是东北很常见的菜包子，根据个人喜好，还可以搭配上粉丝、鸡蛋或者猪肉碎。
尤其是酸菜，不仅能和白肉组成酸菜猪肉包，还能和白肉的二代产物——“油滋啦”组成油滋酸菜包。





冬季杀年猪后，东北人家会用猪肥肉来炼猪油，炸后的“油滋啦”不仅没有白肉那么油腻，还增添了一份脆爽的口感，和酸菜做包子馅，更是喷香十足。
再者，豆角猪肉包也是东北包子的一大特色。此豆角可非彼豆角：在南方，豆角多指豇豆；在东北，豆角多是那种短粗的扁豆、豆王或者叫芸豆，不同地方名字略有不同。



东北的豆角猪肉包，做起来有个关键要素，豆角要用热水焯成半熟，能很好的祛除豆腥味，也更容易蒸熟。豆角包在面皮里，不仅有一股豆香气，也让包子的口感更加丰富。
在东北大包中，玉米面菜包也很有特色。

                    <span>柯娜是一款小品级游戏，也是一款美丽的游戏，但游戏毕竟不是画，不能光好看。作为一款ARPG，它在游戏性的表现上，距离它的美术水平就差得太远了。
先附上大师难度的几个BOSS战，很可能你看着都很无聊。

目录

战斗深度不足

战斗变化不够
弱点位置很微妙
镜头与目标

剧情的薄弱
迷题，缺少巧妙感
无用的收集
不会再出现的怪物
结论

战斗深度不足
作为一款动作游戏，战斗自然是重点，关于此，柯娜可以说是 不及格 。随着时间的推移，战斗体验没有一点可以刺激玩家的因素增加。前期的战斗非常匮乏，而后期同样匮乏。
战斗缺少变化
柯娜虽然有技能树，但能够带来战斗变化的技能几乎没有，除了拉弓的子弹时间。几乎所有解锁的技能，要么是可用性低，要么是伤害不够。
大多数的精英怪或BOSS战都有弱点，攻击弱点后，它会硬直一长段时间，这时候肯定是输出打伤害的最佳时机，像任天堂的大多数游戏都遵循这个套路，甚至有些还只能靠这个时候才能制造伤害，但是柯娜在这个时候，两手空空，不管你用重攻击还是腐灵锤，伤害区别都不太大，很憋屈。
疾跑重攻击，完美蓄力攻击
其实，技能的伤害变化不大没有关系，既然被攻击到弱点硬直了，好歹增加点弱点伤害，也是可以接受的。有时候多死几次后，我就想寻找一下有没有什么技能可以提升这种情况下的伤害，但并没有。
很直白，从游戏开始到结束，全程基本上都是在刮沙。
弱点位置很微妙
首先需要区分一下“不容易”和“无法”这两个概念。不容易是说机会出现了，但不容易好抓住，而无法是出现的机会都极少或是没有。柯娜就是后者，很多的精英怪弱点在背上，但它会永远面对着你，不管你跑得多快，甚至开启子弹时间，都很难攻击到。设计上，要有，就得给我明确的机会，要么就不要给。我有时候为了打弱点，把自己人头送了，都没有打到，很有摔手柄的冲动。还有就是，这个弱点带来的收益很小，除了能够阻止一次敌人的行动，外加一点点额外的伤害，真的是一点点，没看出来有多大的区别。
镜头与目标
镜头的问题其实是可以通过设置关闭的，但这个默认开启的选项，就是一个错误。前面的最多是让你不够爽快，那这个问题，就是在让你抓狂，虽然出现在的情况不多，但出现的时候很可能就是很重要的时刻。
表现为：镜头有一个弱机制，就是会帮助朝向目标，但当需要转向寻找补血的花时，有时候镜头会自动的拉回目标，这很可能会让你失去补血的时间。同理，在多个目标存在的情况下，这问题也同样存在。
我一向对于逆反馈的设计很反感，不太明白这个设计的用意。
剧情的薄弱
要说战斗设计不太行，那好好的讲讲故事也可以，但并没有。一共3段，每段取得3个信物，然后就可以和被腐化的灵魂战斗，目的就是解放他们。听上去是不是很像任天堂的游戏，但是这三段并没有啥联系，讲道理，直接去杀最终BOSS也没什么必要前提条件。那这些都是在告诉我们什么呢？什么都没有，就连主角的情况也基本上没有说明，最后就是玩了个寂寞，啥也没明白。
迷题
说它有，它确实有，但也可以说没有，因为不够巧妙的迷题的意义与作用并不大，而且类型太过相同。给你制造了一些关卡，但却不需要你思考，甚至可以说连想都不会让你想一下，靠感觉就可以了。比如说按顺序点灯，提示都在很明显的位置，而且只是提示，没有任何逻辑。

无用的收集
可收集一共有3个：腐灵，冒子和那个什么（太不重要，名字都记不得）。除了腐灵可以增加使用次数，冒子和那个什么的目的是同一个，那就是给地上的腐灵戴冒子，光找到冒子还不行，还得用那个什么去买。到最后，我都没有把那个什么用出去。
这明显有充数的嫌疑。
不会再出现的怪物
场景里清掉的怪，就不会再出现，不管是否再次进入该区域，只能重新游戏。之所以我把它拧出来说，是因为有奖杯要求，如：“物归原主”。

如果你在路上错过了，那你只能开新周目再来了。
我当时还是为了做这个奖杯，在农田那边找到了目标怪物，但因为一个不小心，把它打死了，然后，本周目就无法完成了。
难道是为了帖合主题，腐化净化了，怪物消灭后就不再出现了？不可思议。这是游戏啊，同志们。
结论
本文的战斗部分，我是在普通通关，大师难度未开始这段时间写的。现在是我大师难度通关后，因此，我可能需要对战斗部分做一些补充，虽然它无法影响我对于战斗设计问题的大方向，但我仍然看到了另一个点，那就是它的战斗核心： 反应挑战 。 没有宏大的场景、炫酷的招式、华丽的必杀，有的只是见招拆招的反应。它并不一定好，但却是一个很重要的战斗本质 。
实话实说，BOSS战我打得很尽兴，那种必须要面对的招式，就得全神贯注，大师难度通关后，成就感满满。

                    <span>德章泰-莫里在12月10日对阵掘金的比赛里拿到20分8篮板9助攻，从而成为马刺队史最快完成3000分+1500篮板+1000助攻的球员。
这条纪录里的“最快”对于如今重建的马刺来说似乎隐含了特殊意义，一名职业运动员的生涯长度总是有限的，而“最快”意味“用时最短”，那么一名运动员能用更短的时间比其他人完成更多的工作，按照这个趋势那不就意味着他的整个职业生涯能比其他人创造更多的价值？也就说明他是更好的球员？
已经迈入重建期的马刺，需要未来的想象空间，但同时也需要在当下看到其中的确定性，前者固然重要，但后者是让人相信前者能实现的基础。
而25岁已经达到3000+1500+1000的莫里无疑是二者兼备的存在，莫里正在用赛场上的进化说服球迷们相信他是值得下注的那个人。



许多球评都把莫里列入了新晋全明星的选择，甚至最佳进步球员也应该有他的一席之地，在这份热烈的舆论氛围里，我们不妨来探讨莫里这赛季在哪些方面的实质性进化给他带来了好评？
我认为，针对这个问题一言以蔽之就是：莫里变成了更好的组织后卫。
如果展开来谈莫里做了什么让自己变成了“更好的组织后卫”，可以用北京时间12月7日马刺惜败太阳的比赛来作为观察的样本。
这场比赛马刺的3连胜被终结，而作为马刺战术核心的莫里则随着比赛进程经历了“从打击防守到被防守限制“的起伏，既能看到莫里进化后的姿态，也能看到莫里尚待打磨的不足。



本赛季，莫里完全接过了进攻组织的主动权，他过去三年场均触球数从56.4到69再到现在的88，展示了他从德罗赞小弟成长为马刺大哥的过程。
人称杨队的塞德斯-杨这样评价莫里：”他每个夜晚都在很好地运营球队”，这里的运营包括场外也包括场内，场外的事情我们局外人不便多说，场内的事情作为观众我们可以略窥一二。
面对总决赛球队的防线，莫里送出了赛季次高的14次助攻，这14次助攻则是他运营比赛的具体展现。而莫里本赛季助攻…</span>

                    <span>昨晚，我窝在沙发，看乒乓球世界杯男单决赛，樊振东对阵张本智和，看着看着，我的注意力忽然被张本智和的名字吸引：TOMOKAZU HARIMOTO

唾沫……卡组，哈里……摩托？我照着念了出来，与此同时，电视里的解说员仍在说：“张本智和这一板抢攻很果断，但是……”
我：？？？不是TOMOKAZU HARIMOTO吗？张本在哪？智和又在哪？


之前在别的比赛里也看过类似的情况，评论员说的名字，跟画面显示出来的英文名读音完全不一样。


这也太奇怪了吧？英文名字Micheal翻译成迈克或者迈克尔，好歹读音差不多啊。

而且很久以前，我就注意到，像“波多野结衣”，明明念作“哈他挪雨衣（Hatano yui）”，根本就没有“波多”，也没有“结衣”，那为啥大家叫她“波多老师”呢？波多在哪儿呢？为什么不叫哈老师呢？


带着这个疑问，我看完比赛就立刻去查了一下资料，发现背后的缘由还蛮有意思。


通俗解释一下：张本智和为什么是&quot;哈里摩托&quot;

很久很久以前，日本只有语言，没有文字，大家就是愣说，不写。
但有时候没有文字确实不太方便，于是人们开始试着造文字，但是实在太特么难了。

后来他们发现：这个世界上已经有了一种叫“汉字”的东西，用它的人都非常厉害，个个都是人才。日本的官修史书《日本书纪》记载着：公元258年，一个叫王仁的博士（真的是个博士），把汉籍传入日本（其中据说有《论语》）。
诶，既然汉字这么博大精深，那就直接拿汉字来用吧！
但是他们很快发现，汉字太坑了——同一个字，居然有好多种读音！
因为不同朝代的发音有区别，以及传过去的人是不同地方的，说话可能有地方口音，同一篇文章，让一个广东羊，和让一个胡建棱或者北京人儿来念，那肯定不一样的，所以日文里的汉字就出现很多种读法，汉音、吴音、唐音、古训、俗训等等。
但是大体上分成两派：
“音读”一派主张按照传入时的汉语发音，或者模仿相…</span>

                    <span>中国男篮大胜日本赛后，杜锋指导与教练组专程在大巴前等候，与球员一一击掌，还对张镇麟上演摸头杀，网友纷纷赞叹：“名帅气度”“成功不是偶然”“有仪式感很好”

这样的细节绝不是临时起意的花架子，4年前，杜指导执教中国男篮蓝队，在金砖运动会上不敌俄罗斯屈居亚军，赛后他就在更衣室与每一位球员击掌鼓励。可紧接着的亚洲杯，蓝队面对澳大利亚下半场崩盘，杜指导的赛后仪式便也在舆论中石沉大海，葬身批评指责之中了。
2018年男篮对抗赛对伊朗
从2012年退役开始做国家队助教，2013年成为广东主帅，杜指导的教练生涯比之球员时代坎坷复杂得多，即便是2017年他将广东重新带回了总决赛，但遭遇新疆横扫，加上国家队的失利，他的眼前都是一片黯淡。
彼时的他，彼时的大家都猜不到短短4年后，风评逆转。对一名教练来说，口碑逆转可能只需要他获得荣誉赢得胜利的那一个夜晚便足够，可那一场胜利的背后，需要的往往是教练、球员、球队持续多年的试炼和等待。
你们还记得，那些年“任性”的杜指导和广东的后卫荒吗？

我们选取的是2015年12月27日对阵青岛的比赛，为什么是这一场？15-16赛季，正好是京粤争霸结束，广东连续输给北京，杜指导声望最低之时。对青岛这一场，广东先赢后输被逆转，遭遇极为罕见的3连败，自从广东崛起以来这近20年，常规赛3连败似乎仅此一回，那时几乎是全网热议广东是否会换帅。
回到那场比赛，让我们来看看不被理解的杜指导的篮球哲学，和他所遭遇的理想与现实的极度反差。
广东的首发阵容：周湛东、周鹏、朱芳雨、埃克-迪奥古、易建联，由于威尔-拜纳姆带伤，杜指导决定打1小4大。
在成为主帅后，杜指导不止一次表达过自己提速的理念，“我希望加快球队进攻的速率，打灵活式的篮球，而不是摆桩子。勇士就是这种风格，这也是国际篮球的一个发展趋势。”

提速通常需要一些必备要素，比如经验丰富的后卫，攻击力出众的锋线，或者移动能力强…</span>

                    <span>中国人懂吃，举世闻名，外国人不服不行。
具体有多出名呢？联合国教科文组织曾在全球范围内，认证了一批“世界美食之都”。截至2021年11月，全球共有19个闪闪发亮的美食之都，中国就占了其中5个：成都、顺德、澳门、扬州，以及前不久刚刚“进群”的淮安。



淮安，位于江苏省北部，古称“山阳”或“淮阴”，地处淮河与京杭大运河的交汇点，自古以来便是水运枢纽、南北要冲，素有“运河之都、九省通衢”之称。





这里，也正好位于中国南北地理分界线上。从古至今，这里车水马龙，天南地北的人与食材，在此交流碰撞，最终孕育出了这座美食之城，以及声名远扬的八大菜系之一——淮扬菜。





这座“不南不北”的城市，人文荟萃，名家辈出。西汉大将韩信，在此受漂母舍饭，终成汉初三杰；晚明奇才吴承恩，在此闭关求索，终成旷世奇书《西游记》；开国总理周恩来，以此为生命起点，终成新中国奠基人之一，更秉持着对家乡滋味的念怀，促成“开国第一宴”。
淮安，究竟有什么魔力，能以厚重历史和精妙美味征服世界，连联合国都流了口水？


淮扬菜，南北吃货大战的终结者
也许你对淮安不熟，但你一定吃过淮扬菜。



在中国八大菜系之中，淮扬菜非常特别：不以所在省份命名。这让不少人以为，淮扬菜就是淮安、扬州一带的风味菜——如此认知，是时候刷新一下了。





淮扬菜的“淮”字，指的是以淮安为代表的淮河中下游流域；“扬”字，则指代以扬州为代表的扬子江（长江）流域。广义的淮扬菜系，包括整个长江中下游、淮河及连接两者的京杭大运河流域，是一片很广阔的地域。



这块土地，除了物产丰隆、人文繁盛，更拥有水网密布、四通八达的地理优势。淮河东西奔流，大运河沟通南北，恰好在此相会；它们邂逅之处，便是今天的淮安。南来北往的食客与食材在此碰撞，撞出了中国最会吃的一群人，以及考究的淮扬美味。



若论淮扬菜的江湖地位，开国第一宴由它唱主角，这名…</span>

You hold the gun I take the wheel
If you say go you know I will
And though this love has its flaw
We’re forever outlaws
You Messed around but I forgave ya
Why do they still want me to hate ya
Cause if im choosing to forget it
Why cant they just mind they business
Cause I’m stuck, stuck like glue
Cause I can’t I can’t I can’t stop lovin you

I wanna see my dawgs on the mountain tops
Them niggas only ballin when they album drop
I gotta line of cars wrap around the block
And …</span>

                    <span>The world’s favorite blue hedgehog is back for a next-level adventure in SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2. After settling in Green Hills, Sonic is eager to prove he has what it takes to be a true hero. His test comes when Dr. Robotnik returns, this time with a new partner, Knuckles, in search for an emerald that has the power to destroy civilizations. Sonic teams up with his own sidekick, Tails, and together they embark on a globe-trotting journey to find the emerald before it falls into the wrong hands. From the filmmakers behind The Fast and the Furious and Deadpool, SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2 stars James Marsden, Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, and Jim Carrey returning, alongside new additions Shemar Moore, with Idris Elba as the voice of Knuckles, and Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey as the voice of Tails.

Letra: 

¿Qué me hizo usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar…

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido, oh - oh

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres …</span>

                    <span>Everything we do is online. We bank online, access healthcare, pay our taxes, build our businesses -  and along the way we put trust in companies to keep us protected.
Unfortunately, companies aren’t great at writing secure software. Contrast Security wants to change that.
Jeff Williams, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Contrast Security, and Steve Wilson, CPO, join the Dev Interrupted podcast to discuss the future of application security (AppSec), the importance of security automation and why the traditional way of doing security - where you scan app after app a few times a year - is over.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



By the numbers: the average application is attacked 13,000 times a month

And has over 35 vulnerabilities

The reasons AppSec should to be automated
How to reduce the cost of AppSec
Why shifting left doesn&#x27;t result in more secure code

Many systems require sending emails to notify users. And testing these notifications manually is a pain. So it&#x27;s one of the best use cases for integration testing. First, let&#x27;s create strongly typed model for our Welcome email:
public class Welcome
{
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}

And we create a Razor template for the email in EmailTemplates/Welcome.cshtml:
@model EmailSnapshotTesting.EmailTemplates.Welcome
@{
    Layout &#x3D; &quot;~/EmailTemplates/_Layout.cshtml&quot;;
}

Welcome @Model.FullName
Welcome to our wonderful service!

And this is how the layout is going to look like in EmaiTemplates/_Layout.cshtml:

                    <span>I&#x27;m planning to start a series of posts showing my first impressions as someone inexperienced in programming who had his first impressions in Python. I&#x27;ll try to post every time I finish studying so that the original feeling is still clear.
While messing around on Discord, I found a discussion about this language and how it was useful in web development. It wasn&#x27;t very long and not all that interesting, but they said something that really caught my attention. 

I really like python and my focus is on web development, so why not try it out?
This thought was what made me start looking for online resources, a task that apparently I&#x27;m not intelligent enough to do, so I asked on Discord.
PHP is a scripting language specialized in web development and that can be embedded inside HTML and is executed on the server, meaning no shady scripts running on the client computer and more freedom working with sensitive data.

PHP can be manually installed by itself, or so I was told, but the easiest way when learning is through those already configured packages, like WAMP, LAMP and XAMPP. People from discord recommended using XAMPP, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with it for now. Having installed it, everything left is understanding how it works.</span>

                    <span>Set up Neovim for Full Stack Development


You&#x27;ll need:
Coc 
emmet
install neovim


Install vim-plug (or any other plugin manager)
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug


I recommend checking out my dotfiles which has lots of comments so you can find any extra features that might be helpful for you.



I will write another post for a more in-depth description of getting started with neovim...
To install Coc, you&#x27;ll want to follow their instructions at the link below. It is 
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
With neovim open, type the following:
:CocConfig coc-html coc-tsserver coc-json coc-emmet  coc-prettier
Coc tsserver is for javascript, typescript, and JSX support
You&#x27;ll want to create a shortcut for :call CocAction(&#x27;format&#x27;). I have the following shortcut so that I can format my projects with space + f:
nnoremap f :call CocAction(&#x27;format&#x27;)
head over to the Node.js downloads page and follow their installation instructions. You can also use your package manager to install Node. 
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo pacman -S nodejs
I highly recommend installing tmux so you can run your frontend, backend, neovim, and git cli in the same terminal window which makes it way easier to keep your workspace clear. Tmux is great because you can name your sessions and easily navigate to the right spot for what you&#x27;re looking to do.</span>

                    <span>I planned how to contribute to an open source project last week and wrote about it in my previous blog. In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!
For the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I&#x27;ve decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college&#x27;s C language course notes. The issue I&#x27;m working on is about &quot;Standardize frontmatter across all pages&quot;. When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.
I&#x27;ve done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:
Added id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages
Each property of frontmatter was unified in order
Unified format of description
Shortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the  inside the 
tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)
Added &quot;Standardize frontmatter&quot; to the CONTRIBUTING.md file
PR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143




  
  
  Getting reviews and change requests


One of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo&#x27;s owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I&#x27;m familiar with the course notes, but I wasn&#x27;t very good at C language.
The goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn&#x27;t change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.</span>

                    <span>TLDR


Responsible AI uses AI to empower individuals and put people’s values first. Its ethical deployment is essential to fight against algorithmic bias.
Intro
What is Responsible AI?
Steps for Responsible AI
Responsible AI in practice
The rapid development of AI will have a big impact on nearly every aspect of private and professional life. The determination of that impact’s success should be judged by how ethically and responsibly the technology is created. With laws not being able to keep up with the pace that AI is being developed, it falls on companies and developers to make a responsible product.

The power of AI is in its ability to be deployed quickly across the world; however, this could also be AI’s greatest threat, as algorithms can spread bias on a massive scal…</span>

                    <span>We&#x27;re going to go over three of the logical operators that Javascript uses:



The benefit of a logical operator is to connect two (or more!) expressions so that the value of the total (all of the expressions you just connected) is dependent on those expressions. 
These operators are used within code to compare variables and values when creating various logic methods, often using their boolean values. When used within functions it gives more logic options for the code to use and change based on user behavior. This can also help DRY up code in condensing functions.
The NOT ! operator is generally used as a boolean. Logical NOT will have truthy value if the operator it&#x27;s called on (like !(6 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) is false and vice-versa (like !(6 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 6) is considered a false value. Here&#x27;s a different way of…</span>

                    <span>Managing Dependencies with go.mod


A project&#x27;s dependencies are declared in the go.mod file. This is where the modules are stored when you do go get . You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. 
When you clone a Go project from github, for example, you&#x27;ll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you&#x27;re coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. 
You may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn&#x27;t have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project&#x27;s go.mod file. 
For example:
github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn&#x27;t have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc. You would then have github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc // indirect in your project&#x27;s go.mod file. 
note: the above is a hypothetical scenario, you won&#x27;t actually have any indirect dependencies with github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2
go.sum includes the checksum for the dependencies to make sure that you&#x27;re installing the exact same dependency as the author used. 
To create a new Go project where you can have a go.mod file, you need to set it up on your GOPATH with a name for your project. 
Running go mod init 
You need to run go mod init before you&#x27;re able to get dependencies for your project with go get</span>

                    <span>Hey there, my name is Tiago and I am the host of Wannabe Entrepreneur (a podcast about what it&#x27;s like to bootstrap a company).  
The great thing about having a podcast is that I have an &quot;excuse&quot; to ask questions to people I admire and want to learn from!
Recently I got to interview Cassidy Williams (@cassidoo
) and she has more than 170K followers on Twitter!! I won&#x27;t lie, I was quite nervous... But she was super nice and the interview went really well.
Here are the top 3 things I learned from Cassidy:
1- Be humble and genuine
2- Some companies want access to your social media
she keeps all the control over her social media. With more than 170K followers I guess that many companies could use it for personal marketing...
3- Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment
that rule is BS! Cassity was never afraid to leave a job where she was not happy and that gave her the opportunity to experiment with different types of companies and find which ones she prefers to work at.
These are just 3 of a lot of lessons I took from my casual chat with Cassidy Williams. Would love to hear your thoughts on the interview. What questions did I miss? You can listen to the full chat here</span>

                    <span>What is Conductor


Conductor is a Microservices orchestration platform from Netflix, released under Apache 2.0 Open Source License.
jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.
Conductor allows you to create tasks that can process JSON payloads in your workflows without writing custom code using jq.  
JSON is a popular format of choice for data-interchange. It is widely used in web and server applications, document storage, API I/O etc. It’s also used within Conductor to define workflow and task definitions and passing data and state between tasks and workflows. This makes a tool like JQ a natural fit for processing task rel…</span>

                    <span>This article will go over the basics of the .NET compiler platform feature for analyzing the C# syntax tree, using F#.
.NET provides a Syntax API that can read any C# or Visual Basic source file and provide the corresponding Syntax Tree for that code.
Why would someone need to traverse the C# syntax tree?
Well, it can be for a number of reasons, maybe you want to gather statistics about how many classes, namespaces and methods you have, maybe you want generate code based on what is already written, maybe you want to create new tools like a new linter or a tool like Swagger. All these things can be done by analyzing the syntax tree.
Recently I found myself using the Syntax API for finding Attributes above certain methods and classes, and based on the name and arguments of the Attributes, I …</span>

Now it&#x27;s time to create our component. So, let&#x27;s make that.

                    <span>从十月份开始，下半年购物季就拉开了帷幕。作为一个购物季扎堆的半年，不知道你有没有注意到这样的一个现象：我们彼此之间互相交流买买买、一起吐槽各路平台与商家套路的时候总是穿杂着一个话题—— 「XX 肯定在偷听我们说话，它广告推送的就是我们那天讨论的」。实际上，这是一个老生常谈的话题。抛开双十一这个特定的时间点，即便是在其他时候我们也能够听到类似的吐槽。
一说到「偷听」，人们马上就会想到隔墙有耳，两只耳朵竖起来的状态。过往的那些不美好的人生经验就会随之浮现并不断提醒自己提高警惕性。这种源自内心深处的不安让我们感到害怕。在马斯洛的需求层次理论当中，安全的需要是仅次于生理的。所以我们很自然地就会给予高度的关注。
荣格与共时性，图片来自维基百科
1920 年代，瑞士心理学家荣格提出了「共时性」的概念。荣格认为：

这些表面上无因果关系的事件之间有着非因果性、有意义的联系，这些联系通常取决于人的主观经验。人总是对巧合印象深刻。

不过，有时候仔细的考量一下，似乎广告推送的也并不总是那么准。这种「偷听」会不会又是一种巧合呢？就是说，App 推送的内容与我们工作与生活中遇到的一些事情恰巧重叠在一起，我们根据自身的人生经验将他们联系到了一起。我们所在意地精准推送又会不会像荣格的共时性中讲的那样？
那么，这些被吐槽的平台到底是否在偷听我们说话？或者更进一步讲，它们是否通过偷听我们说话，进而进行分析并精准广告推送呢？
通过手机「偷听」说话，进行精准推送的可能性有多大？
就单纯的技术而言，手机偷听其实并不是一件很难的事情，但同时，它也并不是一件很容易的事情。究竟通过「偷听」来进行精准的广告推送的可能性有多大，我们逐一往下看。
一般来讲手机悄悄地进行录音通常包括两种情况：一种是（用户授权后的）后台静默监听，一种是突破系统权限进行监听。
对于前者，App 通过静默在后台进行偷听的技术难度大，手机自带的操…</span>

🎁 十二月 Pixel Feature Drop

作为 Pixel 用户，除了 Google 第一方待遇的系统更新支持，另一个众所周知的好处就是你的手机还能随着每个季度发布的 Pixel Feature Drop 收到更多新功能，即便是较早发布的设备往往也不例外。
本周，十二月份的 Pixel Feature Drop 正式开始面向现有 Pixel 手机推送，加入了一系列新功能，也包括对现有 Bug 的修复。
除了 Google 与宝马合作为 Pixel 6 系列新增的车钥匙功能之外，Pixel 6 Pro 还在本次更新之后启用了 UWB 超宽频功能，但目前只能用于提升 Nearby Share 就近分享功能的识别速度。
另一个本次新增功能是用于帮助听障困难者在嘈杂环境下对话的应用 Sound Amplifier：它可以使用手机的机器学习算法来自动过滤掉除对话内容之外的环境噪声：只需要在对话前将手机摄像头对准你与之交谈的对象并选取，放下手机之后便可以在嘈杂环境下正常对话，尽可能地降低外部噪音给听障用户带来的沟通困难。

基于离线模型识别附近播放歌曲的「Now Playing」功能也得到增强：Pixel 4 系列用户现在也可以将本地模型无法正确识别的歌曲手动上传至云端数据库来识别；同时也可以直接将识别出的歌曲标记为喜欢方便后续整理。

                    <span>就像我之前一直说的，即便是电动车，也一样拥有驾驶乐趣，特别是在优秀的调校加持下，更是如此。
作为一个小马力前驱车驾驶员，能得出这样的结论，跟我前不久驾（bai）驶（嫖）的一台车有很大关系，那就是小鹏的P7高性能版，那期节目相信很多人都还有印象。

1.底盘结构影响操控感
其实，要搞懂这个问题，我们最先该聊的，根本就不是动力形式，而最重要的东西，是底盘设计。
什么样的底盘才是“键盘值最高”或者说比较理想的结构呢？这个问题可能问100个人会有100种答案，但是放心，其中出镜率最高的，绝对是两种，双叉臂和多连杆。考虑到造车理念，成本还有布置空间等一系列的问题，现在市面上能见到的，“最具键盘值”的底盘结构非前双叉臂后多连杆莫属了。

保时捷确实前桥使用的麦弗逊，但是人家的调校功力和开发预算并非常规厂家能比的，因此它的厉害并不影响我们以上的结论。

这个结构市场上确实不算是很多见，但是其实有这么几款电动车都用了这个结构，像特斯拉Model 3、小鹏P7、蔚来ET7等这些车型。



而且在使用这个结构的同时，基本上都顺手把能用铝合金的部件都用上了铝合金。这其实跟这些“新势力”厂商开发新车基本上都没有上代车型有很大关系，我要是造车从零开始的话，我肯定也会选择用一个至少从理论上要表现更好的结构啊。


2.调校也很重要
结构不错是个基础，但是接下来的调校也是一关考验，就好像一个钢琴，再是好牌子，调音师是个业余的门外汉，出来的产品也并不会非常优秀的。都说保时捷造车造的好，开着感受好，其实，里面不光是投资，更是有着一个优秀且专业的团队在背后默默付出。什么？你说养不起这么大的团队？那好办，保时捷旗下的保时捷工程公司能够随时成为你的供应商，帮你调车。

没错，保时捷旗下有这么一家名为保时捷工程的公司，这家公司的技术团队有保时捷工程是的实力，这个团队不造车，但是会参与到有需求的厂家的造车过程中，也…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计师Calvin。大约2010年，我有幸涉足了DNF、QQ炫舞、疾风之刃、QQ飞车等产品的影视宣传，随即便入了游戏行业的坑，直奔琳琅天上工作室（也就是现在的天美），开启了我十年的游戏美术设计生涯。
作为老飞车玩家，秉持着对飞车的喜爱，这十年来，我一直从事QQ飞车的制作。从起初的端游场景赛道设计，到现在端/手游双端场景设计、IP包装、CG........每一个环节都留下了我努力搬砖的身影。
工作之余，我喜欢画画、模玩、游戏，也喜欢旅游，因此看到这个话题，我想我可以简单地向大家分享一下我的观点。
先说结论，我认为游戏是有潜力带动旅游业的，尤其是在疫情隔离的影响之后，如何鼓励人们从宅在家，到有意愿出去散心走走，一个好的办法，就是让大家在游戏中去看见，甚至体验旅游景地的美好风景与人文温度。
身为休闲赛车游戏《QQ飞车手游》的美术负责人，近几年我们一直在尝试将游戏与现实中的景点结合，比如今年我们与四川省旅游宣传促进中心合作，在游戏里推出了“梦回古蜀”与“云游天府”两条全新赛道，去一站式、沉浸式地呈现现实中的三星堆博物馆与四川的人文风貌。

“梦回古蜀”赛道展示的“古”，是四川的历史沉淀。玩家驾车驶入庞大的三星堆博物馆，在曲折幽暗的地宫回廊中穿梭，一路经过巨大的青铜立人像与太阳神鸟，去丈量和感受那神秘厚重的古蜀文明，体验一种冒险感。




与之相比，“云游天府”赛道则展现的是“今”，是四川的现代生活。在乐山大佛的脚下，坐卧着岁月静好的山城，有川剧变脸、蜀绣隽美、熊猫嬉闹，也有火锅串串的飘香、麻将的热闹、宽窄巷子的风情，体验一种安逸巴适，人间烟火的生活氛围。




在社交平台和部分随机问卷调查中，有不少玩家称赞了四川主题赛道的设计，并希望我们推出更多地域文化与传统文化的联名赛道，并为自己的家乡打call。这确实让我们感到十分欢喜，也认定“游戏”与“文化旅游…</span>

先码住～下周整理下思路详细回答
顺便 @没有文化的俗人 《街球江湖》漫画的编剧一起～回忆下这段痛并快乐着的日子呗～

2021/12/8     追加评论：
谢邀， 其实之前就想写写《街球江湖》的事，但每次提笔便放下，这真是个很难回答到问题：有太多想说的，关于创作本身，关于对行业的看法，关于一直以来我们团队所奉行的模式理念这些，但每次都是千头万绪无法找到开头的感觉。
直到上上周看到这个问题，忽然脑海中就崩出来上面那段总结，花了两周时间顺着上面这个思路重新捋了一下自己对《街球江湖》的看法



                               part1: 《街球江湖》是一部在慢慢变好看的漫画
创作背景
每次提到《街球江湖》创作，它的诞生背景总是个无法绕开的话题 —— 街球连载以来在读者中得到了很多好评，但客观来讲，从专业角度看，这部作品还存在很多不足。尽管如此，我也无论如何也想让大家知道，在它诞生但背后有一个为之倾注来了极大热情与专注，无论怎样都想让它变得更好的团队在不断滴努力。
街球项目起始于17年夏天，彼时我正经历第一次漫画创业的低谷，寄予厚望的《超级绿》因为资方战略调整而无奈终止，和助理们搬进朋友公司的二楼小隔间里，一边安抚大家一边寻找新项目。 
一个朋友发来一个漫画项目的委托问我有没有兴趣：一家影视公司想做篮球ip，提供剧本，找团队做成漫画。 


接下这个项目的原因有三个：
1. 篮球主题：可能是我的一厢情愿，我总认为自己可能是国漫圈里最适合制作篮球漫画的作者之一（实在是太不要脸来），也急需一部能炫技和展现实力的与众不同的漫画来东山再起。
2. 影视公司为开发篮球ip而制作漫画：对方影视公司希望先以漫画形式把故事内容展现给大众并获取一定影响力和观众反馈。这种在早期就开始…</span>

                    <span>Every legacy. Every rivalry. Leads to this. Cobra Kai S4 premieres globally Dec 31, only on Netflix. 

COBRA KAI takes place over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). Season 4 finds the Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang dojos joining forces to take down Cobra Kai at the All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament... and whoever loses must hang up their gi. As Samantha and Miguel try to maintain the dojo alliance and Robby goes all in at Cobra Kai, the fate of the Valley has never been more precarious. What tricks does Kreese have up his sleeve? Can Daniel and Johnny bury their decades-long hatchet to defeat Kreese? Or will Cobra Kai become the face of karate in the valley?

With winter fast approaching, the theme of this video is utterly lit so kick back, pull out some marshmallows and roast a few over the open flames from our brand new Super Troop, Super Dragon.  Joining him is a brand new Siege Machine, the Flame Flinger.

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape &#x27;Life B4 Fame&#x27; with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.</span>

                    <span>The protocol that powers the web is known as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A connection can exist between the two programs to send and receive data. 
A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers. Networks have to follow these rules to successfully transmit data.
Python provides a library called sockets to make connections and communicate data between connections.

Sometimes I find my models cluttered with a lot of things: relationships, attributes casting, scopes, custom methods, etc. 
When this happens, one thing I like to do is move my scopes in a dedicated builder. This post will show you how I do that. 
We are working with bunnies because cats are all over the place already and because of the pressure I get from Coton the Tige. 🐰

Let&#x27;s spin up our artisan command to create the model with the migration flag (-m) and the factory flag (-f):
php artisan make:model Bunny -mf

Now let&#x27;s define the data structure of our fleecy table (gist):
Schema::create(&#x27;bunnies&#x27;, function (Blueprint $table) {

                    <span>Dashboards are great for visualization and keeping track of what&#x27;s going on. Managing a repository for a team can be cumbersome and keeping a track of all the pull requests even so. One potential solution could be the dashboard, dashboards are great for visualization and keeping track of what&#x27;s going on. 
In this article, we will discuss how to create a Github Pull Requests Dashboard using ReactJS and Material UI.
Setting up React
Let&#x27;s begin by creating a boilerplate using the create-react-app
npx create-react-app github-pr-dashboard

Install Material UI
We will be using Material UI as a UI library. It boosts up the speed of development as we won&#x27;t have to manually write CSS.

                    <span>Somewhere buried in my dusty basement lives a signed copy of Dan Cederholm&#x27;s classic book Bulletproof Web Design. I purchased it during my first trip to An Event Apart in 2007. This book meant a lot to me back then, and almost 15 years later, many of its concepts still hold true.
The premise of the book is that designs should be &quot;bulletproof&quot; to accommodate the many ways they can be used.
I&#x27;m using the term bulletproof partly to describe flexibility—in other words, designs for the web that can easily accommodate various text sizes and amounts of content, designs that expand or contract along with whatever is placed within them.
I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for many years. More recently, my focus has been on building design systems. Although a lot has changed on the World Wide Web over the…</span>

When a project has a sophisticated multi-stage review process, the workflow quickly goes out of hand - pull requests get lost, and the review time grows, leading to unhappy contributors.
For example, In Doka&#x27;s case, we have four sections of our website, each with a dedicated editor: HMTL, CSS, JS, and tools. On top of that, there is a responsible for demos, an illustrator, and a publishing editor. We wanted to have one place where they can go to understand what job is pending.

                    <span>Introduction


If you run Node in production, sooner or later you&#x27;ll come across a common bug known as a memory leak.
This was the case with my current side project, expose. I wrote a popular article Six Ways To Drastically Boost Your Productivity As A Node Developer which mentioned it, then suddenly the server was overloaded.
During the period of high load, I could see that a memory leak was forming.
expose?


expose is a command line app that makes its simple to give a public URL to any web based app you have running locally on your machine. So if you have a local API runnig at http://localhost:8000 and you then run expose 8000, it will generate a public URL that you can then share.
It works by creating a websocket connection between the client and the expose service, which listens with …</span>

Summary: Make your toy web apps more robust and manageable by following the Twelve-Factor App methodology.
This is the second part in a series of posts detailing the 12 Factor App. In the last post we looked at:
Your codebase and made it deployable across different environments
Dependencies and why they’re important in reproducibility
Configuration files and how to make them useful across different environments
Backing services, what they are and how decoupling gives your app more flexibility
If you need a refresher or aren’t familiar with the above already, take a look at the last post. Many of the earlier concepts are used as building blocks for the concepts in this post.

I believe I am not the only who has read tens of express guides and never really found the perfect way of implementing it.
In fact, I am confident to say that every Node.js developer has read at least 5 to 6 different guides on writing Express applications. How to make it work is not really a problem nowadays. However, have you ever asked yourself what is the right way to do it? 
With that in mind, I decided to create a boilerplate that would summarize all the best practices used nowadays in the software industry, ensuring reliability, maintainability and scalability. This is what Bulletproof Express tries to accomplish. These are the features currently provided:

Acra allows configuring data masking to certain database fields. Data fields stay encrypted in the database, but look masked/anonymized when reading through Acra.
💡 Data masking is useful whether anonymizing datasets for reporting or exchanging the data with untrusted third parties. Acra supports full or partial data masking, allowing customization of mask format.

So, with data masking, data stays encrypted, but could be easily shared with untrusted parties without revealing it.

Why pay a translator or purchase an expensive translation app when you can build an effective multilingual translator with python in 5 minutes?
Going furthermore, we’ll make this translator even more fun by adding a text to speech capability to it. This will also make it easy for one to use this translator to learn a new language. Sounds interesting right?
Talk is cheap..I know right? Well then let’s get down to the business of the day. To build this amazing translator with python, we’ll be needing a few python modules:

                    <span>2021-2022 的秋季校招又拉开了帷幕。在今年的秋招中，我依然作为业务条线代表参与了全职和暑假实习生的简历筛选、面试和终选的全过程。这几年来，我都会在四季度集中经手两百余份简历。作为一个面试官，我每年都会为不少面试者扼腕叹息：从简历上我可以看得出申请人资质非常不错，但是他/她却不经意间犯了一个或多个「小错误」，导致最后我不得不忍痛割爱。而且，这些错误往往不会在常见的简历教程中提到。
在展开下文之前，我还是想强调一下：简历是非常个性化的产物，因人而异，因公司、岗位、行业而异，切不可一概而论。本文旨在从一家金融机构面试官的角度讨论类似行业的简历「避坑指南」，仅供参考。
你的简历在第一关会经历什么
申请者在网站上提交申请资料之后，人力资源部（HR） 会在网申临近结束或结束以后将资料全部导出，并进行第一步筛选。第一步筛选一般由电脑自动完成，主要确保申请者符合岗位的基本要求（如毕业年度、学历、材料是否齐全等）。如果有在线测试（如 SHL）的话，HR 也会设置一条分数线进行初步筛选。但从多年的经验来看，在线测试的分数线更像是一条及格线（比如 60 分），并不会过于苛刻。
在初步筛选之后，所有的网申材料都会打包提交给业务部门进行第二轮的筛选。这第二轮的筛选就是由业务经理进行的人工筛选了。一般我们会以简历为主，结合网申材料、开放式问题、在线测试成绩和近两年新增的视频回答进行一轮筛选，并给申请人分为三类：Yes、No、Maybe。在每一位的申请材料都审阅完毕后，我们会先考虑各个面试官手中标明 Yes 的应聘者，然后综合讨论所有的待定应聘者，填补剩余的面试席位。
在之后每一轮的面试、活动当中，之前所有的材料（包括网申、简历、以及每一轮评审的评论）都会一起交给下一轮的面试官。在这当中，简历又是每一轮面试官在见到本人之前，最直接了解应聘者的机会。因此，简历的重要性不言而喻。

                    <span>众所周知，去年的 macOS Big Sur 再一次更新了视觉设计风格，其中一项改动就是「焕然一新」的工具栏。至于焕然一新在哪……最明显的地方就是更大的额头。

这样的设计好不好看见仁见智，但有一点是肯定的：这么多的空间如果浪费就太可惜了。 以文件管理器 Finder 为例，尽管系统已经提供了一系列功能图标来充实工具栏，但仍不一定能满足我们的要求。
实际上，Finder 一直以来都允许用户向工具栏添加任意文件夹、文件或者应用程序图标。 这项功能宣传得很少，但实用性很强，在「大额头」设计的今天更是显得尤其应景。
至于方法，也极其简单，按住 Command ⌘ 键，然后将任何文件夹、文件或者应用程序的图标拖拽到想要安放的位置，松手即可。

通过这种方法添加到工具栏中的文件夹和应用，在功能上类似于 Dock 中的图标，兼有「传送门」和「篮子」两种功能，换言之：

如果直接点击，则可以打开对应的文件夹或启动应用程序
如果将某个文件图标拖动到图标上，则可以将该文件移动到对应的文件夹内，或用对应的应用程序打开该文件。

由于工具栏的「区位优势」，通过这种方法适当添加常用文件夹和应用图标，可以有效减少在整理、编辑文件时需要拖动鼠标的距离，优化操作效率。
如果想让工具栏排布显得更有序，还可以在工具栏空白处点击右键，选择「自定义工具栏」，然后拖拽添加一些「间隙」，为图标建立视觉上的分组效果。
个人而言，我习惯在工具栏添加「桌面」和「下载」文件夹图标，这样可以随时切换到这两个常用位置或将文件移动过去；应用程序图标则添加了 VS Code 和 iTerm 2，以便快速以纯文本形式查看文件，或者切换到命令行环境继续操作。
如果在添加图标后想要重新调整顺序，可以再次按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标拖动。如果想要删除已添加的图标，按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标将图标扔出工具栏即可。</span>

                    <span>鸭屎香、狗浇尿、鸡屎藤，没错这些可都是美食

最近，平地刮起一阵“鸭屎”风。一款叫“鸭屎香”的茶异军突起，突然横扫了大大小小奶茶店的菜单。
某些头部奶茶品牌直接玩起“花活儿”，把一系列“鸭屎香”做底的奶茶丢进菜单。C位的鸭屎香宝藏茶包装更叫勇猛，“鸭屎香”三个硕大的黑字印在橙色的纸杯上，旁边还此地无银地注明“我真的很香”。


微博上，话题“鸭屎香奶茶到底有多好喝”快被网友玩坏了。有的网友秉持考据精神，发帖称“帮你们试过了，没有鸭屎味”；有的则随性表示“鸭屎香真好喝，我又激情下单了”。


这款顶着“鸭屎”之名的茶到底是什么？它所代表的“名称劝退”派食物在中国是一个隐藏的狠人派别，各种硬核气味、诡异生物在这个门派中争奇斗艳。敢不敢上车来一波？


战胜鸭屎香，
还有一堆来自洪荒的气味在等你
鸭屎香的走红，一半以上的功劳来自“鸭屎”二字，猎奇的名字是打开年轻人心扉的钥匙，但鸭屎香，它到底是鸭屎味，还是香味？


鸭屎香到底是什么味？
鸭屎香名字虽野，却正儿八经出身名门，是潮汕茶叶大族凤凰单枞的直系。凤凰单枞产于潮州凤凰山附近，是乌龙江湖里出了名的耐冲泡、强回甘、香气高扬，江湖人称“茶中香水”，香到经常被误会加了香精的那种。

甚至有粉丝放过狠话：“铁观音‘七泡有余香’就让人津津乐道了，而凤凰单枞茶，你完全可以把前七泡直接倒掉！连最普通的凤凰单枞都可以冲十二泡以上。”算你狠！
凤凰单枞甚至直接用香型来命名品种，只要在市面上看到什么黄枝香、芝兰香、蜜兰香、桂花香、肉桂香、茉莉香，那都是凤凰一族的。
从这种意义上来说，鸭屎香还真的没有虚假宣传，它是真的香。

至于为什么以“鸭屎”命名，流行的说法有两种。一说它引进后种在“鸭屎土”（即黄土壤）上；二说因为当地人喝过之后都说好，茶农怕被人偷去，便丑化命名，谎称这叫鸭屎香。

鸭屎香虽然不是最老的品种，但这些年在凤凰家族里已小有名气。它易…</span>

                    <span>被子弹击穿的水壶
急救包、绷带、医疗剪……在展柜中依次整齐排列。


它们曾属于同一个人：年轻的卫生员贠宝山。


紧挨着医疗剪，一只金属水壶静静安放，壶身上浑圆的弹孔，铭刻着一段浸透血色的往事。


1951年秋天，抗美援朝战场上，炮火连绵，鲜血浸染了中马山的泥土。贠宝山穿过硝烟，抚摸一具具失去声息的身体，找寻还存活的战友救治。


战斗胶着，敌人动用了大量飞机火炮，向战场上倾泻数万吨炮弹，呛人的烟尘弥漫在阵地之上，携着火光的弹头肆无忌惮地穿梭飞射，贠宝山远远望见几十米外，班长倒在地上。


枪林弹雨，火光冲天。这短短几十米想要越过去，却难过万水千山。


就在此时，一颗炮弹猝不及防在贠宝山身旁爆炸，他一瞬间晕了过去。


等贠宝山恢复意识时，他的肠子已经顺着鲜血流到地上……


那场战斗中，贠宝山用尽最后的力气，挣扎着爬到班长身边，想要拿起水壶喂水时，却发现那只水壶早就被子弹击穿，里面的水几乎流尽。贠宝山就握着这个被击穿的水壶，永远遗憾地合上了双眼。


展柜里，被封存的水壶早已洗去血痕，或许只有斑驳的磨痕和凹凸的表面，还残留着那段烽火岁月的印记。


一旁展板上，短短数十字介绍，铭刻了一个年轻生命的终点。黑白图案定格了贠宝山的面容。照片上那个圆脸稚嫩的年轻人，牺牲于22岁的秋日——


1951年9月7日，中马山战斗中，志愿军第42军第125师第375团9连卫生员贠宝山奋勇抢救伤员，负伤后坚持不下火线，因伤势过重牺牲。立特等功，授“一级英雄”荣誉称号。


2020年10月，为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战70周年，中国人民革命军事博物馆举办主题展览，将贠宝山的故事和那只水壶纳入其中。


2020年11月，抗美援朝纪念馆网站中，一位名叫贠佳峰的网友在线上烈士名录中找到了贠宝山的名字，留言道：“致敬英雄！致敬我的爷爷！您是中国人民的骄傲！是我们永远的榜样！”

                    <span>When the Arataki Gang is involved, even the most traditional repertoire may usher in a new twist.
Although some in the audience have enjoyed such a surprise, it has caused quite the trouble for the Tenryou Commission.
Let&#x27;s see who will get the last laugh this time: Arataki Itto with his booming laughter, or the soldiers who are swift at maintaining law and order.

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok &quot;For You Page&quot;! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!

Hi all,
It’s almost the end of year. BetterDev has been 3 years. I never focus on growing it. All I do is just send out newsletter from thing I think will help everyone level up.
Next year, it’s going to change a bit. I will put more personal opinion on the issue. If you prefer a neutral one, as in just a list of link then let me know in the reply
How Does NTP Work?
           
NTP is a protocol intended to synchronize all computers participating in the network to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The core of the protocol is NTP’s clock discipline algorithm that adjusts the local computer’s clock time and tick frequency in response to an external source.

                    <span>Hi all,
I recently got myself into the situation where all my local git repos had the wrong remote addresses.  This was caused by a change up on our git account.  
You can see the url that git is currently using by opening the &#x27;config&#x27; file in the .git folder.  You&#x27;ll see it under the &#x27;[remote &quot;origin&quot;]&#x27; section.
Luckily this is pretty trivial to fix.  You can either update the url directly in the config file, or run the following command...
git remote set-url origin new.git.url/xyz</span>

                    <span>Destroyer is a console game I made for my codecademy CSC 101 final project. It is very similar to the game battleship. It uses 2D list to represent the board classes and objects to organize and simplify the code. I know it&#x27;s sloppy, and I&#x27;m sure more experienced devs will look at it like what is this, but it works well and I&#x27;m happy that I made it 😀

                    <span>Let&#x27;s me explain with a simple example:
console.log(&#x27;First log&#x27;);
console.log(&#x27;Second log&#x27;);
console.log(&#x27;Third log&#x27;);

As we can see, every line of code will waits for previous line to complete execution before execute next line. this is called with synchronous.
Here another example:
console.log(&#x27;First log&#x27;);
setTimeout(()&#x3D;&gt;{
    console.log(&#x27;Second log&#x27;);
},2000)
console.log(&#x27;Third log&#x27;)

setTimeout function will wait for milisecond time that set in second argument and executes anonymous function in the first arguments
First log
Third log
undefined
Second log

As we can see, Third log does not wait for Second log to execute, the method of not waiting for the previous code to complete is called asynchronous.
The best way to use asynchronous is when your website working with server to fetching data or getting response, instead of waiting all data from server fully loaded that maybe takes more than one minutes (depend on speed of your internet and server speed to resolve request) you could use asynchronous to make sure that code ahead will execute and javascript will not waiting server response to complete.</span>

I&#x27;ll be covering how to create a resell item feature to your marketplace, since this was an issue to me and to other developers to whom I have talked to. 
First, in the NFT contract, we&#x27;ll add a function to transfer the token. You may be asking why I don&#x27;t just simply use ERC721&#x27;s tranferFrom function. And the reason is that when I tested my functions, in some situations requests reverted with &quot;transfer caller is not owner nor approved&quot;, even though msg.sender &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ownerOf(tokenId) asserted true. So my solution was to write a custom transfer function. But feel free to share the solution for this stra…</span>

                    <span>Help users with vision disabilities find a search


Usually we know how to place a search for users without vision disabilities. But how should we do that for users with disabilities?
There is a special search role in the WAI-ARIA standard that we should add for the form element. In this case screen readers will start to display search in the &quot;Regions list&quot; mode that is used by users for navigation.
Pay attention, if we don&#x27;t do that search will not be displayed in this mode. So it will hamper users start interaction with search. They will have to find a search using common keys. It&#x27;s much longer than if they use the &quot;Regions list&quot; mode.

Did you think sometimes about how better to move focus when users open elements such as modals or dialogs?

                    <span>Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.
A couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. 
The specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh
 posted this:
Dev.to as a headless CMS
Visakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read
#react
        #javascript
        #webdev
        #opensource
      
This was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.
You&#x27;ve probably noticed several deprecations lately. It&#x27;s all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.</span>

                    <span>Hello Friends.
I finally did it. Happened about a month and a half ago. I was ✨ promoted ✨ to a senior level engineering position. Want to know the most frustrating part about it? It didn&#x27;t feel like I deserved it. Yes, imposter syndrome sticks with you.
I started my career as a software engineer five years ago after working a job as a developer at a small startup that just needed hands and thoughts which I kinda see as my boot camp experience.
I started my &quot;engineering&quot; career at a larger, yet still small startup in San Francisco, where I learned a lot, but not enough to become a senior there. I did primarily backend work with a spattering of frontend excursions. I got close to senior at that company. So close that my manager wasn&#x27;t able to pinpoint anything specific to work on.

Reverse Proxy
Reverse Proxy Implementation


Step 1: Create origin server
Step 2: Create a reverse proxy server
Step 3: Forward a client request to the origin server (via reverse proxy)
Step 4: Copy origin server response to the client (via reverse proxy)
Common errors
Conclusion



Proxy server is a server that provides a gateway between the client (Alice) and the origin server (Bob). Instead of connecting directly to the origin server (to fulfill a resource request), client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required action a origin server on the client behalf (e.g. get current time).

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。
下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。

一、历史回顾
Web 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。

Web 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。

二、Web3 的特征
Web3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。

我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。
Web 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。
娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。
在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。
三、虚拟世界
所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。
到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。
四、Web3 是分布式的
这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！
这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：
（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；
（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。
五、区块链的作用
如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。
这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。
一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。
另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。
六、数字资产
区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。
如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。

举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。
我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。
我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。
创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说：&quot;Web3 就是所有权&quot;，就是这个意思。

如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。
目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。

                    <span>树莓派是一个小巧的设备，由英国树莓派基金会开发的微型单板，设计的目标是以低价硬件和自由软件促进学校的基本计算机科学教学。麻雀虽小，树莓派本身也是一个五脏俱全的计算机，并且提供通用的 USB 接口、RJ45 网口以及 GPIO 排针接口予以扩展。且由于其较低的售价，受到了各种人群的喜欢。
但是，并不是喜欢树莓派的所有人都有计算机科学的背景，相当大一部分小白都在通过关注极客玩家们的教程，一步一步跟着教程操作来复刻他们做出来的东西。可是，尽管有了教程的帮助，小白在实际操作的过程中也还是会遇到很多失败的情况且不知道如何独立解决。
所以我打算向大家介绍 Balena 这个一站式的解决方案。
Balena： 完整的生态
Balena 是一套完整用于开发、部署、管理 IOT 设备，并提供了云用于连接这些 IOT 设备们的工具和服务。它包括了：

balenaEngine 是一个为嵌入式设备优化的运行引擎，等同于 Docker 的存在，但胜在软件体积更小，需要传输的镜像层更小，内存占用也更少。
balenaOS 是一个极简的 Linux 系统，不同于 Raspberry Pi OS，仅包含了 balenaEngine 以及一些必要的系统组件，使得硬件资源能够被最大化目标软件的使用，但借助 Balena 的其他服务，又可以很轻松的部署我们想要的工具。。
balenaHub 是一个类似 Github 的地方，开发者把软件装载进 balenaOS 中并发布到这里，用户可以从这里免费下载已经打包好的「系统镜像」。
balenaEtcher 是一个开源跨平台的系统镜像烧录工具，有精美易用的 UI 界面，可以把上述系统镜像烧录到 tf 卡中，然后插入树莓派直接开始使用。
balenaFin 一个建立于树莓派计算模块之上的开发板，有更好的存储和电源扩展等。

                    <span>前言
随着安全和隐私意识的增强，越来越多的人已经在提供手机号、银行卡号时越发慎重，也知道每一个服务都要尽量使用不同的随机强密码。相比之下，邮箱地址的安全性此前受到的关注并不够充分。其实，邮箱地址也是个人信息的一部分，在交出之前值得多加提防。想象一下，如果能每一次注册都使用不同的随机匿名邮箱，是不是也很酷？
其实，这样的匿名邮箱服务正在变得主流。在 9 月推出的 iOS 15 上，Apple 更新了「iCloud+」功能，其中就包含一项名为「Hide My Email」的匿名邮箱服务；11 月 16 日，Firefox 浏览器也推出了类似的 Firefox Relay 功能。算上之前入局的 Fastmail、DuckDuckGo 等，匿名邮箱的选择前所未有地多。本文中，我们就对这些主流的匿名邮箱服务做一比较，帮助大家选择。
邮箱别名——简易版邮箱匿名方案
在正式对比之前，有必要简单提几句「邮箱别名」（alias）功能。这项功能早在很久之前就被不少邮箱服务所支持，可以看作一种简易版的匿名邮箱方案。具体而言，别名相当于邮箱地址的一个「小号」或「昵称」，发到别名的邮件会和主邮箱共享收件箱。
加号地址
创建别名最简单、通用的方法就是在邮箱地址的域内部分（即俗话说的用户名）后面加上加号（「+」）和任意字符串，常用的 Gmail、Outlook、iCloud 等邮箱服务均支持这个技巧。（加号地址是由 RFC5233 标准定义的，该标准并没有限制用什么符号作为别名的分隔符，但实践中绝大多数邮件服务都采用加号。）
举个例子，你有一个邮箱地址是 sspai@gmail.com，那么发送给 sspai+aaa@gmail.com、sspai+bbb@gmail.com 的邮件都会发送到 sspai@gmail.com 这个地址。
方便是方便，但如果是出于隐私保护而这么做，会有两个问题：

                    <span>事实上，平台的老旧对产品品质的影响还是很重要的，所以我们在买车的时候非常有必要了解对意向车型的生产平台进行了解。
举例，比如一款车换代车型即将上市，旧款（上一代）车型依然在售，如果这时候买了旧款就有些可惜了，相当于是买到了上一代的技术。那如果二手车呢？举个典型例子，都是登记日期在2018-2020年之间的丰田卡罗拉，价格差别不大，车况各有不同。如果你了解12代卡罗拉来自TNGA平台，11代卡罗拉于2019年7月停产，在车况和价格没有太大差别情况下，就一定要选择车身铭牌的出厂日期在2019年7月之后的12代卡罗拉(也可以看后悬架，扭力梁的都是老平台车型)。

为什么？当然是冲着TNGA平台啊，比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构（更准确说法是架构）所产车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。这也就是说来自TNGA架构的第12代卡罗拉，操控性能和驾驶乐趣，包括安全性方面比上一代车型有了显著提高。同样的，这也适用于凯美瑞，只是凯美瑞两代车型之间外观内饰有明显区别，比较不容易混在一块儿（买二手车时）。

尽管平台的最大意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而帮企业节省成本，但从消费者的角度，理论上，新的造车平台比旧（上一代）的更加先进和高级。因此，他也能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。
比如说，大众现在MQB平台的车型，比上一代PQ25/35平台产品在轻量化方面就有了明显提高，用户获得的好处自然是节约了油费。前面也提到了，丰田TNGA架构下的新一代车型，操控方面都比以往有了显著提高，哪怕卡罗拉这样的标准“买菜车”，开起来也不再平庸乏味。
再看现在流行的电动车，以往很多电动车往往是“油改电”的过渡性产品，会在电机、电池摆布、车内空间、行驶及安全品质等方面出现很多不够完善的地方，而来自全新的纯电车造车平台的电动车就很好地解决了这一问题。

总的来说，新旧平台的产品尽量选新的，但凡事没绝对，某些新平台车型的某些细节甚至还不如旧平台车型，比如PQ46的斯柯达昊锐，反而比MQB平台的速派，在底盘厚重感、转向手感方面主观感受更好。此外，老款车型在产品生涯末期往往有较大优惠，如果一些产品点上的差异消费者本身也不是很敏感，那倒也没有什么。  

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。
目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

路上偶然遇见的河




这一次，我们两家、六人、一辆房车，从丽江出发到拉萨，然后原路返回。美景的图片集锦已经发过了，今天就发一发这一路记录的日记吧。。。
28日 第一天 大理到丽江到香格里拉
早上7点半，我们迎着大理的朝霞出发了，第一站就是去丽江的房车生活家提车点取房车。
在沟通了解房车事项近五个小时之后，我们终于出发了，奔向我们的目的地，西藏。这对于我们，对于四岁的孩子们来说，将是一个未知又充满惊喜的挑战！
特意从丽江玉龙雪山脚下转了一圈后，晚上我们到达香格里拉古城附近的广场。逛了夜晚的独克宗古城，给开了一天车的爸爸们补充能量，吃了一顿牦牛肉大餐。
夜晚的香格里拉真冷啊，让我们几个大人有了一种回到大学宿舍的感觉，水是刺骨的，但想象着我们领略着世界第三极绝美的风光，心中就充满了期待。

Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one. Because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy ten minute videos and unfortunately, reality is, well, complicated.

my 30-day online filmmaking &amp; storytelling class just launched! Enrollment is open now until December 27.  the class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience, designed to teach you everything I know about filmmaking and storytelling, i&#x27;m going to share with you my entire creative process from start to finish. You&#x27;re going to follow along with me as I create 2 brand new movies from scratch... from how I come up the ideas, all the way through exporting the final videos.

over the month, you&#x27;ll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 2 original, shareable films of your own.  its is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. I spent the past year working on it, and I&#x27;m extremely proud of the result. It&#x27;s designed to level you up whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a more experienced filmmaker.

The class officially starts on January 10, 2022, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you&#x27;re interested

                    <span>Background


I just finished creating a few small lambda functions using Python.
My project needed the following libraries:
requests for making HTTP requests.
pysftp for creating SSH connections to different servers. 
If you need a different library, the approach should be the same, assuming it&#x27;s installable using pip or pip3. 
Unfortunately we didn’t have access to Container Registry (ECR) so we couldn&#x27;t create a docker container, which would have allowed us to install the dependencies as part of the docker container creation.
We instead had to create &amp; upload a zip file containing our application code and dependencies.
While we could include the application dependencies in the zip we upload, this has a few disadvantages:
It slows down each upload, which is not ideal as you might end up u…</span>

In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll build a dashboard on top of postgresSQL database. This is a simple dashboard showing a view of projects and users stored in the database. We&#x27;ll use React for frontend, semantic-ui for UI library, Canonic for creating APIs, and to add some graphics we&#x27;ll use recharts library.

It was a regular screening interview with someone from another part of the world sitting in the same-furniture office.
Rainy weather in winter does not help to focus at all, and I go to get some coffee. Being sleepy is something I want to avoid at all costs. Pouring over Columbian coffee gives a brain energy spike. It is important to have fifteen minutes before the interview starts. You need to switch focus away from the routine. 
A notebook with a pen are prepared to record the candidate&#x27;s answers, emotions, body language, and my quick feedback.

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Dec. 2nd we had our second Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 2. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.
Did any of the types listed surprise you?
What great examples have you seen of a particular content type? What stands out about it?
Sarah Rainsberger mentioned she found the distinction between a “Tutorial” and a “How to Guide” interesting. She liked that the book made these two content types distinct.

                    <span>Probably, you have used the speedtest website before, but did you know that speedtest has a python library.
In this tutorial, We will learn to use the speedtest library to test your internet Speed. We&#x27;ll also learn how to use speedtest command lines.
Let&#x27;s get started. 
To install speedtest via pip, follow this command:
pip install speedtest-cli

After installing the speedtest package. Now, let&#x27;s see how to use it with the code.
In the following code, I&#x27;ll test my internet download speed.
import speedtest

# Speed test
st &#x3D; speedtest.Speedtest()

# Download Speed
ds &#x3D; st.download()

print(ds)

let me explain.
First, we import the speedtest package. Then, called Speedtest() class. Next, test my download speed using the download() method. Finally, print the result.

I bet you got that. #Smartdev
What is version control?
What is git?
How does git work?
What is GitHub?
What is the difference between git and GitHub?
It is a way to document the code you use for analysis. 
Git is a distributed Version Control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux Kernel, that makes tracking code over time easy and effortless.
Git:
Tracks iterative change that&#x27;s made to the code one tells it to manage. Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.


It facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. 


Easily switches between Versions of your code.


Easily undo changes.




  
  
  What is GitHub?🤔


First, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
Git is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.
Git is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.
Can&#x27;t be any simpler than that!!

                    <span>I was working around a few days back, managing the release of the project with versioning and proper tags associated with it which results in writing the python code.
I have written a simple python function that will call the API of GitHub and will Create/Fetch /Delete the release on GitHub.
Note** You can manage the same with CURL command too but I was facing some authentication issue, so haven’t done, I haven’t tried with explicitly passing the auth token in header by -H tag, you can give a try.
Have a look at the below snippet of code which can be easily integrated with Jenkins pipeline
&#x60;# Begin
user &#x3D; &quot;&quot;             #username of github account
https://api.github.com&quot;
Here, tag_name and releaseId variables are only required if you want to delete a particular release, which you will rarely come across.
# Fetch latest release from github


The above code will be used to fetch the latest release present on GitHub.
# Create latest release on github


This snippet of code is used to create the release on GitHub, which contains payload in JSON format.

Even with this payload, you can easily create prerelease of the master branch, which can be tested in the Staging environment.
# Delete release from github by passing tag_name &amp; releaseId


The above deletion method is not often required.

                    <span>What is Samba ?


We know that when you think of samba, you immediately think of happy Brazilians dancing.

But.. We are so sorry because situation here is not quite what you think. (We know that you are trying to hide your bewilderment because we experienced the same at the beginning.)
So it always happens like this...

Now let&#x27;s come to our main topic, what is the real samba we are talking about?
SAMBA is a project developed in 1991 by re-adapting the SMB network protocol as free software with reverse engineering methods.
However, it is also worth mentioning that the difference from the default SMB protocol to which it is implemented progresses in a path and version map.
For example, SAMBA 3 released in 2003, enabled the integration of file and printer services between GNU/Linux systems …</span>

                    <span>One of my least favorite code review comments to give or receive is 
&quot;This is great, but we already have code to do this over here...&quot;
Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m glad the comment happened when it did. It is better than never getting it, but think about the time that was just lost. 😱
As the reviewer, I treat this as a smell. What can we do better to make this reusable code more obvious? 
Better documentation? 
As the author, I feel lazy. How did I miss that we already do this? 
I am new to my current codebase, and I have had this happen a few times already. I knew the codebase at my previous company like the back of my hand. I would tell new folks to assume the code you need to write is already there. Sometimes it is true, sometimes not. But it was a healthy assumption that saved them time an…</span>

                    <span>继 Beats Studio Buds 在 7 月推出之后，没想到还没半年时间，Beats 今年还有新品发布。与前者一样，Beats 最新推出的 Beats Fit Pro 是一款真无线蓝牙降噪耳机，不同的是，这款耳机搭载了 Apple H1 芯片，除了主动降噪和通透模式，它还支持空间音频、iCloud 同步、自动切换等新功能，售价 1,599 元。

外观设计
Beats Fit Pro 的充电盒与 2019 年推出的 Powerbeats Pro 类似，方形圆润的设计，尺寸比后者稍小、比 AirPods Pro 的充电盒更大一些。类肤质材质的运用也是现在 Beats 产品的「标配」。类肤质材质表面的缺点也很明显，容易沾染指纹、油污，需要经常清洁；当然，好处是不容易产生划痕等不可修复的损伤。

虽然充电盒尺寸接近 Powerbeats Pro，Beats Fit Pro 的耳机大小可是实实在在地小了不少，尺寸与 AirPods Pro 和 AirPods 可以说是差不多一致。同样作为入耳式耳机，由于没有「侵入感」明显的耳挂式设计，Beats Fit Pro 的佩戴体验自然比 Powerbeats Pro 要好上不少，个人认为与 AirPods Pro 的入耳感受接近。不同的是，Beats Fit Pro 用上了一个全新的耳翼式设计。

此前市面上采用耳翼式设计的耳机，多是提供了多个尺寸的可更换耳翼选择，以让用户实现稳定舒适的佩戴体验。Beats Fit Pro 则直接通过柔韧性更好的软性硅胶材料打造通用型耳翼，让耳翼能够根据不同耳形大小达到灵活弯折的效果，让不同用户都能轻松佩戴。
据 Beats 介绍，Beats Fit Pro 的耳翼基于人体工学设计，外形和选材经过大量用户的运动数据测试和验证，不仅耐用、稳定，还优化了耳机的佩戴贴合度和⻓时间佩戴的舒适度，确保声学性能不…</span>

在我卖掉 iPad Air 3 而买了 iPad mini 6 之后，就一直在为其物色一款合适的键盘。
之前 Air 3 一直使用的都是官方 Smart Keyboard：价格奇贵、手感奇差、还不能保护背面。但无需充电、吸上即用，拥有任何其他键盘都无法相比的一体性。
可惜的是，Apple 并未给 iPad mini 提供官方的键盘解决方案，而是仅注明了其支持「蓝牙键盘」。
iPad mini 仅支持蓝牙键盘
这并不奇怪，毕竟 iPad mini 的尺寸决定了它更偏向于一款内容消费设备，而非生产设备。不过这也不妨碍我为 mini 选配一款便携式的蓝牙键盘，以随时随地完成轻量的文字处理任务。
那些被我淘汰的备选项
我最先看中的是 Logitech 的 Keys-To-Go 键盘。作为上架 Apple Store 的产品，这款键盘有着简洁漂亮的外观和专为 iOS 设备优化的快捷键。同时，作为非折叠式的传统键盘，Keys-To-Go 的尺寸也只有 24.2*13.7 cm，仅仅比 iPad mini 6 (19.5*13.5 cm) 大上一点。抛开略显昂贵的售价 (¥480) 不谈，它的确是 iPad mini 的理想搭档。

不过，经过一番搜索，我也成功被 Keys-To-Go 的问题劝退了。首先是耐用性。有不少网友（1, 2, 3, 见评论区）都表示 Keys-To-Go 在使用一两年之后，可能会出现按键鼓包等现象，这样的耐用性让我很难把它当作「传家宝」。
有关按键鼓包的评论不少

                    <span>作为一个主打内容创作的社区，少数派中大家讨论最多的可能就是写作工具了，而其中以语法简单，专注于内容创作著称的 Markdown 编辑器则是其中的焦点，从以优雅的设计和易用性著称的 Ulysses 和 MWeb，再到主打同步的 Bear 等一系列写作工具，其实都向我们展示了 Markdown 这样一款语法简单的语言是如何真正的提高文字创作者效率的。而作为一位「老少数派」，我则从 2015年开始全面转向 Markdown 写作，只不过一开始我就在使用本文的主角—— Typora，一开始选择其实最看重的跨平台特性：在 Windows 平台上很难再找到一款颜值上线的 Markdown 编辑器了。

在发布首个测试版的之后的第六年，这款「纯粹」的 Markdown 编辑器也正式发布了首个 1.0 正式版。同时上线的还有其收费计划——买断式付费，可激活三台设备，如果大版本更新可能还要另外收费，费用为 89 元人民币。在习惯性「白嫖」六年后，正式宣布收费也引起了不小的争议，那么这样一款纯粹的 Markdown 编辑器是否真的值得付费？或许看完本篇全方面的测评，你会在心中留下你自己的答案。
真正意义上的全桌面平台支持
相比某些只是支持单一平台的 Markdown 编辑器，Typora 在最早期就开始对多个平台的支持，除了最为常见的 macOS 以及 Windows 之外，还支持 Linux 桌面环境，并且所有的平台的外观以及功能都保持了高度的一致。

而在本次 1.0 正式版中，Typora 进一步提供了几乎全桌面平台的支持，这里不仅仅是系统层面的，还包括系统架构。除了包含了在此前测试版中我们就已经熟知的 x86 /x86-64，还加入了对 ARM64 版 Windows 以及 Linux 的支持，尤其是在类似树莓派这样的单板电脑中，也有了设计美观的 Markdown 可用。

                    <span>我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。
我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。
为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。
翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：
随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug
还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：
可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动
这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。
展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：
这个项目放弃前的一段录屏
我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。
所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！

                    <span>游戏音频，即是存在于游戏世界里的一切声音，然而大家是否能够想象，在如今的一款开放大世界游戏中，存在的声音文件数量也许不是以千计，也不是以万计，而是以十万计。
在越来越庞大且复杂的游戏面前，游戏音频早已不是什么隐于背景中的音乐，仅由几位神秘的音乐艺术家就能闭门完成。在才华与灵感之外，AI 算法、机器学习、Object-Based Audio 技术、跨国合研等先进技术与模式，也已悄然融入游戏音频这块依旧让人略感陌生的领域。

游戏音频到底是什么？正在经历哪些新趋势？未来将如何发展？我们邀请到了来自天美音频中心的六位音频专家，其中有一直与天美共同成长的中国设计师，也有来自海外 3A 游戏厂商的外籍专家。他们将与我们分享对游戏音频的热爱，以及对其未来发展的展望。


—— 我认为非线性声音设计是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
大家好！我是 Beej Paz，我已经在游戏行业摸爬滚打了 13 年，加入天美之前，我在育碧担任音频总监。
游戏音频是我毕生热爱的事业，我认为非线性声音设计，是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
当玩家在游戏中的决策/行动有了意义时，我们就能以此为切入点，让音频发挥作用。如果声音设计能够更贴近玩家、更具有意义，那么我们也能顺利建立起与玩家之间连接的纽带和信任。
音频带来的愉悦和沉浸感可以让玩家得到情感上的满足，塑造一个又一个的“感觉棒极了”的时刻。我们为玩家打造出的这些“魔力”时刻，不仅能够启发灵感，还将影响下一代从业者对未来游戏音频的观念。
我们总是从过去和现在的那些伟大前辈们身上得到启发，收获灵感。这是一种传承，我们这代游戏音频人就是这么过来的。

                    <span>写在前面：感谢天美同事帮我把想法翻译成了中文跟大家交流。以下所有配图都是公开图片，仅供专业探讨，所以请不要指望这里可以看到拳头或者育碧的机密信息；）
大家好，我是 Francois Dallaire，坐标新加坡，目前是天美 F1 工作室的技术美术专家（Principal Tehnical Artist），已有过十多年的技术美术从业经验。
多年来，中国手游在海外的成绩一直很亮眼，但直到近一两年，我们才逐渐看到中国游戏公司在 AAA 游戏研发上与日俱增的兴趣。
在此之前，很多 AAA 大作都有中国开发者参与，但大多是负责部分模块或者作为外包团队，很少能主导完整的项目。现在中国工作室开发自己的 AAA 项目，招揽和借助全球 AAA 人才的经验来起步也是很正常的事情。在西方，这种 AAA 公司间的人才流动早已成为常态。
与此同时，中国游戏公司在研发技术上的进步也很引人注目。比如 2018 年在游戏开发者大会（GDC）上亮相的虚拟人 Siren，展现了中国游戏公司对于次世代研发技术的探索，吸引了许多像我一样的全球游戏研发从业者的注意。我相信中国游戏开发者已经做好准备，迎接新的挑战。

随着中国游戏公司加入 AAA 游戏的全球化研发潮流，这成为了一个双向选择的过程。游戏公司在寻找特定领域的资深人才，而人才也在寻找有潜力的项目。
就我所知，技术相关的岗位往往最先受到关注，比如技术美术、技术动画等。经过种种考虑，我选择加入了有 13 年自研积累的天美，相信这里的项目会为我带来更广阔的职业前景。
全球化研发潮流下的技术美术
放在 15 年前，游戏行业还不存在技术美术（Technical artists，以下简称 TA）岗位，但随着行业的发展，TA 已越来越受重视，并成为当前中国游戏行业最紧缺的岗位之一。
我从事 TA 已有十余年的时间，入行之初也经历过一些变化。最初，我在动视做游戏测试（te…</span>

                    <span>Boxing superstar and five-time world champion Gervonta “Tank” Davis put his boxing skills on display, winning a rousing 12-round round unanimous decision over the relentless Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz to retain his WBA Lightweight World Title in front of a star-studded, sellout crowd of 15,850 at STAPLES Center live on SHOWTIME Pay-Per-View. 
 
There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
“That’s my style. ‘Pitbull’ is always going to be on the attack,” said Cruz. “I think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.”
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis’ ribs.

                    <span>A few days ago, my friend made me a scavenger hunt on the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players&#x27; hearts... Will I be Solving my Friend&#x27;s Impossible Minecraft Puzzle...

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. 

Thanks to @Vort3xDragon for making the scavenger hunt, this was epic!

                    <span>what&#x27;s up typescript enthusiasts 👋
as seen in this tutorial?
1- Install @types/node in your project
$ yarn add @types/node -D

// or using npm

$ npm i @types/node -D

2- First of all, download the VSC extension TS Env Typings
3- Specify env-typings.json file in the root of your project.

4- Add path field to your development .env file

That&#x27;s it, Enjoy!
1- Specify path for the generated output using output field in the JSON config.

2- Auto detect env variable type so that It can give you a nice example in the intellisense on how to use and parse it.
so as an example if you&#x27;ve a number env variable It&#x27;ll tell you to use parseInt to parse it before using it cause env variables are always read as strings.

3- Variants for an env variable, so you tell the extension what are the possible values for an env variable so It can generate better types for it and recommend you a nicer example to use

add a comment at the end of the env line that includes &quot;# variants:&quot;


specify the different variants for your variable seperated by a &quot;|&quot; like you would in typscript


quotes are optional around the variants values




That&#x27;s it.
Hope you&#x27;ve a great day, curios to see your feedback 🤗</span>

                    <span>A while back, someone asked me in an interview to print &quot;Hello World&quot; in the console 50 times without using a loop.
Afterward, I start pondering... let&#x27;s find out?
If you want to check it out: https://github.com/Noriller/js-console.log
I&#x27;ve made a repository and used jest to test if everything was working, I&#x27;ve also used this auxiliary function:
function Log() {
  console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}

Most were just variations of the same thing... but I did manage to make it work in some unexpected ways.
Because... why not?
Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log…</span>

                    <span>Things rarely go as planned, especially in the world of programming. Errors are unavoidable when writing code, which can be frustrating at times. 
via GIPHY
In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to handle exceptions in Python.
An exception is an error that occurs while the program is running. In some cases, an exception may cause the program to stop or produce unexpected results. For example, taking a look at Fig 1.0. This program gets two numbers from the user and divides the first number by the second number, and displays the result. However, when the program is run, an exception occurs as shown in Fig 1.1.

Fig 1.0



Fig 1.1


The error message displayed in Fig 1.1 is called a traceback. A traceback provides information about the line number(s) that resulted in the exception. In Fig. 1.1,…</span>

                    <span>Episode 11: Use the Filesystem Class to Read a Directory



In this episode, we create a Post model class and move the post finding code from the route definition to the Mode class method find(). We add another method all() to this class where we fetch all posts from the resource/posts directory. We use the Laravel File Facades Illuminate\Support\Facades\File fetch all the files from a directory into an array. 
Contributed to the Blog project:
Move post finding logic from route def to a Model class
Make the posts index page dynamic by getting file contents using the Laravel File Facades
Before:
Route::get(&#x27;/posts/{post}&#x27;, function ($slug) {
    $path &#x3D; __DIR__.&quot;/../resources/posts/{$slug}.html&quot;;

No fear, this is not a tutorial. This is more of a strategic guide. Decision makers will continue reading. Apply these concepts to your project.
Opinion. After deploying countless websites, you will see the narrow difference between tech stacks. Python, PHP, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, and others all write HTTP responses. This uniformity means developers can pass all HTTP handling through a standardized web server interface like Apache/NGINX.
 
Web servers are a MUST and highly optimized for driving web traffic. Apache/NGINX fulfill common needs such as simultaneous requests, encryption, and &quot;path rewriting&quot; (sales). Businesses that do not use quintessential web servers are doomed to face early scaling issues.

Read more about Conductor here: https://github.com/Netflix/conductor
Visit our codebase and give us a star, it helps! :)
Conductor can orchestrate HTTP services out of the box without implementing any code.  We will use that to create and run our first workflow.
To follow the steps in this article we will need to have Conductor running on your local. We can do that by following the steps here
This is a sample workflow that we can leverage for our test.

                    <span>The terminal can be an intimidating place for anyone, like me, who has spent most of their life living in a ✨Graphical User Interface✨ paradise. 
In the GUI, it seems like nothing can really go that wrong. However, on the command line, it feels like a single cat-on-keyboard moment can bring everything crashing down. 🐱🔥
It is my belief that the terminal itself is not what frightens us, but the unfamiliarity of it all. Once you build up your confidence, the terminal can, and will, be your new best friend. 👯 I promise!
The first time I entered the terminal, I had no idea where I was. You don&#x27;t believe me? Look at the first 15 commands I ever ran: 
 Unfortunately, hello and where am i, yielded no results. You know what did? Making a ton of mistakes, which I like to call, &quot;practice.&quot; (I real…</span>

                    <span>At Arbington.com we use Stripe.com to handle all of our payments. 
It&#x27;s secure, fast, and honestly it&#x27;s a developers dream.
For this, you should be familiar with Ajax/Fetch requests and being able to work with an API. We use Python on the backend, so we use Stripes&#x27;s Python API. 
We will show some demo code, but you&#x27;ll need to fill in the blanks. 
First, you&#x27;ll need a Stripe.com account. It&#x27;s free to setup, and they give you two sets of API keys:
A test pair of public and private keys 
A live pair of public and private keys 
The test keys will make payments to your test account, and toggling between testing data and real payment data is as easy as clicking a toggle button in their dashboard. 
Two things to note about Stripe:

                    <span>In honour of Hannukah this year, I undertook to write 8 web components tips, one for each night of the festival. Tonight is the 8th and final night of the festival. The mystics said that this night combines and contains aspects of each of the seven previous nights, so I&#x27;d like to share a compilation of those tips with the dev community.
Wishing you and yours a fully Lit Hannukah!
Did you know you can add reactive controllers to an element via a class or field decorator? You don&#x27;t even need to assign it to an instance property!

  return function(klass) {

                    <span>The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays. Array is a special type of object that is mutable and it is used to store multiple values.
In this article, we will implement our own array methods from scratch. These implementations don&#x27;t intend to replace the existing methods but to provide a better understanding of how these methods work and their uses.



Methods
Description




indexOf()
Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, otherwise returns -1.


lastIndexOf()
Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, otherwise returns -1.


reverse()
Returns the reversed array.


forEach()
Executes a provided function once for each array element.

                    <span>近期，Mental Canvas 这款特殊的 iPad 绘画 App 凭借其独特的画作展示效果闯入了公众视野。

简单来说，这是一款拥有「3D 画布」的草图绘画工具，你可以将图层分别放置于立体空间中的不同位置，最后得以通过运动的「摄像机」来展示整个画作。

Mental Canvas 目前提供的功能数量不算多，本文将逐一详细介绍，作为简单的使用教程提供给各位参考。  
界面排布
Mental Canvas 除了画布界面外没有设置其他界面，在打开 App 时会立刻创建一个新项目。操作界面中的按钮排布和交互设计的逻辑与大多同类产品存在较大出入，说实话这让我在刚上手时有一点懵。
界面中设有「顶部工具栏」、左侧的「画布及图层列表」、底部的用于定位摄像机的「时间轴」，共三个板块。顶部工具栏从左至右可以分为「操作区」「绘制区」「定位区」和「模式切换开关」四个区域。（当然，这些都是我自拟的名字。）

绘制区
在顶部工具栏中的绘制区可以点选使用「画笔工具」「橡皮擦工具」「油漆桶工具」来进行作画。选中画笔工具后再次点击该按钮可以展开画笔设置界面，提供了更改画笔类型和调节画笔粗细的选项。

这三个按钮右侧有「调色盘」按钮，展开后可以进行取色或自定义颜色。

选取调整界面
位于绘制区最左侧的是「选取调整」按钮，选中后会在顶部工具栏置换为一系列新按钮，实质上是进入了选取调整界面。顶部工具栏左侧的区域为「选取区」，右侧为「调整区」。

选取区
选取区的按钮用于选取图层内的部分内容以便调整，其中提供了「按笔画选取」和「套索选取」两种选取方式，分别可以选择画面中一部分笔画或选择圈选的部分区域作为选区。其余的按钮分别为「向选区添加」「从选区减去」「取消选取」「反选」。
调整区
调整区包含几种对选区的调整操作，从左至右分别是用于修改选区部分颜色的「重上色」、清除选区内容的「删除」、启用后会使后几个调整改为对…</span>

2021 年 11 月 12 日，宫崎英高又一次「跌入」神坛。这次倒也没别的，只是万代南梦宫于 2019 年 E3 游戏展上亮相的新作《艾尔登法环》终于开始了发售前的首次封闭网络测试。虽然仍在监修的游戏内容在封测中的表现依然需要打磨，但其优秀的总体质量和极高的媒体热度已然将玩家们对游戏跳票的不满冲刷殆尽，万代南梦宫甚至宣布该作的首发预期销量高达 400 万份，综合宫崎英高作品一贯的强口碑和高销量，这个数字似乎还显得保守了那么一点。
如今作为世界知名游戏发行商的万代南梦宫同时也是任天堂的最强游戏代工厂，其下属的工作室有半数以上为任天堂开发游戏。仅在 NS 平台，除去万代南梦宫自家发售的各类粉丝向冷饭之外，《马力欧赛车 8》这样的第一方大作有半数以上的内容由万代南梦宫参与制作，而《任天堂全明星大乱斗：特别版》这样的爆款游戏则是全盘交给万代南梦宫承包。众所周知，万代南梦宫在玩家群体中一直被归类为「任黑」，但这两家公司在游戏开发事务上的密切关系却形成了一种奇怪的 CP 感，不禁让人直呼「磕到了」。
相比起万代的小红标，这个 Logo 在游戏行业中更加为人熟知。
万代南梦宫由成立于 1950 年的万代和 1955 年的南梦宫合并而成，这两家公司是日本游戏产业的两大支柱，虽然侧重的领域有所不同，但它们都有过一个共同的合作伙伴和竞争对手：任天堂。与 1988 年就使用「替身攻击」欧拉任天堂的南梦宫不同，万代从一开始并没有那么勇。 FC 时代，作为任天堂授权厂商之一的万代自然也不满于任天堂不近人情的审查机制，与任天堂发生了一点小摩擦，不过二者之间…</span>

For the first time in the cinematic history of Spider-Man, our friendly neighborhood hero&#x27;s identity is revealed, bringing his Super Hero responsibilities into conflict with his normal life and putting those he cares about most at risk. When he enlists Doctor Strange’s help to restore his secret, the spell tears a hole in their world, releasing the most powerful villains who’ve ever fought a Spider-Man in any universe. Now, Peter will have to overcome his greatest challenge yet, which will not only forever alter his own future but the future of the Multiverse.

                    <span>This is the story and theory of the origin story of the Minecraft Villager. Who is he? And what is his secrets? That&#x27;s what we uncover in this Minecraft Video. This theory / lore was wild! Minecraft&#x27;s most evil villager used to be just another innocent humble villager. He and his followers would eventually become the illagers.

                    <span>So, C++ extends C, and as that being the case, the implementation of varargs persisted (and hasn&#x27;t changed, since it could break already existing code).
In C, you could do #include , which included some functions for navigating the arguments.
.h files are deprecated (in C++).
So I&#x27;m wondering, what&#x27;s the effective way of using varargs in C++?</span>

                    <span>In this post I&#x27;ll demonstrate a way to understand, analyse and reduce the time complexity on algorithms, specially on nested loops.
The examples will use Ruby but it can be translated to any programming language.
Working throughout a variety of projects, it&#x27;s not rare to stumble on pieces of code like the following, a &quot;nested loop&quot;, which is a loop under another loop:
for group in groups
  for user in users
    # do something with the group and user
  end
end

Analysing the above code, and assuming we have 100 groups and 100 users:
for each group (100 times) we iterate over all users (100 times), which leads 100 * 100 &#x3D; 10000 iterations
each iteration has a cost to the CPU, so the more iterations we do, the more our algorithm will perform worse
if the lists grow over time, we can face seri…</span>

                    <span>The third minor version of Agrippa, the React component CLI, is finally out!
Since v1.2.0 came out, Agrippa has seen tremendous growth - counting the difference in stars on the GitHub repo, for example, we&#x27;ve grown by 120% (154 stars) over the course of just over 40 days! 
This is a good opportunity to say that I&#x27;m truly grateful for everyone who have tried Agrippa out and joined the community; I&#x27;m delighted to see Agrippa growing and being used, and I&#x27;m super excited for it to grow and improve further in the future.
So, thanks everyone!
Get started here.
As for the new version, this one was in the works for longer than the previous two; integration tests, in particular, were a challenge to implement.

As a developer, integrating APIs into your project is imperative. I recently integrated PayPal&#x27;s payment gateway on a side project and plan on sharing how to do it.
PayPal is well known for online payments. Its credibility and developer experience have convinced many users to use it. 
client-side. And the second one is server-side integration.
If I talk about the reading resources:
A developer won&#x27;t need anything further than visiting this page. I really don&#x27;t think you need anything else. Documentation
Reasons to consider this resource-
The workflow is very well explained.
The code sample is available
Steps to test out provided.
Talking about the video resources:





This is a pretty short and concise video. 
It is from the official channel of Paypal.
This video very well explains the concept of different ways to integrate on any website.
Covers all the cases and is easy to follow up.
There is one more resource, that developers can follow up. I am not promoting their channel in any manner but I liked their flow and ease to follow.
Paypal Official Source
I will not be getting into the benefits of applying on Client or Backend. That is up to the developer&#x27;s choice of preference. If I had to recommend one, then I would have to say an easy way to implement would b the first one.
Getting on to the resource, this video takes care of most of the integration:




API integration I would say. I used this node module paypal-checkout
Installing it was very easy.
The npm page was
also very helpful and informative.
This resource has Video tutorials.
Demo app space and much more cool stuff.
This was all enough for integration I think. Moving ahead, I will be sharing my reviews of my experience. Learning was also easy as I expected, the official support and documentation were very helpful. But the

                    <span>CircleCI is not the most popular CI/CD platform for open source contributors today, but it is widely used by many big sharks in the industry. So we have to keep in mind how to accurately configure it. 
CircleCI offers several execution environments. Those bold nerds from San Francisco call them executors. An executor defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job. Set up your jobs to run in the docker, machine, macos or windows executor and specify an image with the tools and packages you need.

Also, CircleCI provide using so-called orbs with its platform. Orbs are open-source, shareable packages of parametrizable reusable configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. You may involve orbs to reduce configuration complexity and help you integrate …</span>

I either end up over or under evaluating myself. This is due to who I think I am maybe completely different how other people actually perceive me to be.
I used a few different ways to identify my strengths and weaknesses. This consisted of:
Asking my peers and those around me: this helped me create a less self-serving bias list. I avoided asking people that I wasn’t too close with as they would give me vague and ‘nicer’ strengths and weaknesses. 
Taking an MBTI test: this helped me understand my personality better and how this can be reflected in my strengths and weaknesses

                    <span>When I started my first developer role about a year ago, I was both excited and worried. Excited to code on the job, and worried that they&#x27;d fire me when they found out that I didn&#x27;t actually know how to code. 
I had just written my first lines of JavaScript a couple months ago, and the knowledge gaps I had seemed infinite. It felt strange to call myself an Engineer when others who started with me clearly knew so much more than me. 
At first, I attributed these self-doubts and feelings of insecurity to my career change. After all, people&#x27;s professions often form an important part of their identity, and mine had just changed completely. But over time, I realised that a lot of people around me felt the same, regardless of their background.

                    <span>写了两篇关于消费的文章，这次回归产品经理主业，聊聊个人管理。
做好个人管理和做好产品经理这两件事在我看来是相辅相成的。首先，我们身边的大部分人都是毕业就开始打工（甚至还没毕业已经在打工了），大部分的时间都花在了工作上，一方面是为了生存，通过劳动我们会获得报酬，另一方面也可以说是实现自我价值或者其他你觉得重要的点。总之我们的生活方式以及整个人都在不知不觉间被工作塑造了。
以我自己为例，产品经理这个岗位的其中一项职能是项目管理，虽然有的公司会细分出「项目经理」岗，但大部分中小型公司的产品都在兼任或曾经兼任过项目经理。所以在产品经理工作中，我逐渐养成了项目管理的思维模式：使项目能够在有限资源限定条件下，实现或超过设定的需求和期望的过程，而个人管理是我们每个人最独一无二的项目。

百度百科：在个人管理中，个体既是管理者，也是被管理者。

背景
一开始我的个人管理诉求源于我对现实生活的不满，毕业后我留在家乡工作，住在家里。因为无法随时所欲地生活，就十分想拥有自己的住所，然后我制定了一个 3 年买房计划。可当时的我不知道个人管理怎么做，更没有认清现实，只是内心有一个很想实现的目标，其他全凭感觉，每天的日子还是过得浑浑噩噩，不仅没有缩短跟目标之间的距离，还在走弯路。
工作中的管理实践
所幸我的工作是自己喜欢的，因为能接触到更多的信息，并不断学习新东西。我需要每天在工作前明确当前是项目的什么阶段，写下今天要完成什么任务，要跟谁沟通以及得到怎样的结果，然后在每天结束工作后记录当天任务的完成情况并复盘：是否存在风险？该如何安排明天的工作？——当然你也可以把这些简称为「日报」。除此以外，我还要去了解行业发展趋势和热点，国内外优秀互联网公司最近又推出了什么新 App、新功能等等，就需要有工具去整理并归纳这些资料以及尽量高效。
通过工作，我首先接触并掌握的个人管理内容是信息管理也可称为知识管理。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。
中山纪念堂
「城市漫步」（citywalk）通常会有一个领队带十多个人在城市中走一段固定路线，以此观察和了解城市的历史、建筑和文化景观，这种旅行方式在日本和欧洲国家比较流行。但国内目前只有上海有比较多团队组织城市漫步活动，但其实中国还有很多城市同样特别适合漫步，比如中山。
中山城区保留了许多老街老巷，历史丰富的老式民居藏匿于其中，路边是为行人遮阴的高高的行道树，城市中还有平靓正的美食，这些让中山成为一座十分适合行走的城市。而也我因为在中山生活而爱上了城市漫步，在中山生活的四年多时间里也走过许多的大大小小的街巷，喜欢上用行走的方式了解一座城市，去旅行的时候总是先往老城区的巷子里钻。于是我编辑了这篇文章来分享了自己在中山漫步经验，希望为大家认识城市提供一种新的视角。
俯瞰中山
一、以历史文化景观为中心的城市漫步
中国东南沿海地区的许多建筑都受民国时期南洋华侨带来的建筑风潮的影响，比如下面要提到的碉楼和骑楼，以及随处可见的各式民居。这些建筑在吸收外来建筑审美的同时又结合了当地传统的文化，并在建造中因地制宜的产生了多种多样的形态，每栋建筑都有自己独特的个性，成为中山街头独特的风景，而这些都是只有通过城市漫步的方式才能体验到。

民居
漫步路线：仁厚里、永安里、龙母庙街、拱辰路、水关街、下河泊、弓箭巷、华贵坊、从善坊
由于核心城区没有受到很大程度的开发，中山保留了大片的老住宅区，这些住宅区的交通网络交错纵横四通八达，许多历史悠久、形态各异的民居就扎根在这些街巷深处。中山现存的老民居不…</span>

                    <span>When someone says Apple Watch, the first thing that comes to the minds of a lot of people is fitness. And this makes total sense, considering Apple mostly markets the health features of the watch. However, there’s a lot more to this smartwatch than just tracking your activity, workouts, and the data revolving around them.

                    <span>大家好，我是《秦时明月》的执行制片人薛小明。首先还是对各位喜欢《秦时明月》的秦迷朋友表示感谢。《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》十五周年版，已经播出第三集，相信大家都看到了一段精彩的打戏，不知道看得过瘾不过瘾。相信大家从中也能看出，我们在这个版本上花费的心血。

对于这部作品的意义，正如沈导之前回答提过，这次的十五周年版是在《秦时明月》播出十五周年之际，答谢秦迷和观众朋友的一份回馈。为了更好的效果，这次《新秦时明月》的制作也有很多不易，除了用我们最新的技术提升了画面的质感和各方面的细节之外，我们还进一步提高了打戏的观感。对一部武侠作品来说，打戏毫无疑问是至关重要的。而与注重特效的影视作品不同，《秦时明月》一直是那种“拳拳到肉”的写实武学实践者，相信看完第3集的观众就更能够感受到这种风格。

这一集的打戏占比是比较高的，从前面无双与项家子弟的切磋，中间少羽和无双单挑，到最后危急关头盖聂的一剑救场，可以说既还原了我们第一部的经典剧情，又增加了很多亮点。在武戏上，我们着重表现人物的特色以及更真实的打击感、紧迫感。为此，我们加快了打戏的节奏并尽可能的展现出角色见招拆招的设计，比如少羽和无双的这段打戏，无双的特点是力量强又有着钢筋铁骨，一旦被他抓住就很难脱身反击，所以少羽更多是依靠身法的灵活躲闪去进攻他的薄弱部位。且不管是无双还是少羽，所做出来的很多组合动作以及运镜都是经过不断地调整，同时是连续镜头，这样可以看出人物的连贯动作。

为了这些效果，我们的武戏部会与我们的动捕演员深入交流，所以武戏这方面，我们确实是花了很多力气去做。我想这也是秦时明月传统武学的魅力之一。
在正片的最后，大家可能注意到这是一段在旧版《秦时明月》中没有出现过的镜头，即盖聂找到天明并保护他的这段回忆。这段回忆是我们对剧情细节的一个补充，也是为了让盖聂这个角色更立体。相信通过这些细节的补充，可以让观众对盖聂为什么会叛离秦王宫的原因有了更多自己的理解。

这一集中主要涉及到的点就是以上这些，后续的剧集中还会有更多精彩丰富的内容呈现，希望大家能够多多支持我们。在此也感谢粉丝和观众为我们提出的建议，之后我们一定会继续努力，为大家带来更好的作品。

                    <span>大家好，我从2006年进入游戏行业，长期从事开放世界游戏开发的美术及技术美术工作。对于游戏内容生产工具以及研发流程管线方面，我有着长期使用以及开发经验，直接参与过多个知名AAA游戏的研发，同时也支持其他研发团队的工作。来到天美技术中心后，我正在负责技术美术工具流程和技术方案的研发、推广落地以及技术支持。
近几年，开放世界游戏项目遍地开花，开放世界游戏的海量内容对数字内容设计和生产带来了两个大的挑战：一是内容制作量的大幅提升，二是内容品质提升，包括美术的高品质，丰富多样性、独特新颖性等要求。这两个挑战促使游戏从业者研究探索更多新的技术工具和工作流程来应对。
程序化生成是国内游戏制作方面的热门话题，还记得我曾参与制作一款海外大型开放世界游戏，当时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能比较简单，一个开放世界关卡美术可以制作和迭代一平方公里的关卡地图。
而两年后，我又参与了另一款开放世界游戏的制作，此时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能已经被迭代优化，一个关卡美术可以制作五平方公里的关卡地图。从中可以看出，先进的工具和流程，对提高数字内容生产效率的助力非常明显。
程序化生成通过在工具中设置一些程序化规则，去自动生成游戏内容，确实能在一定程度上提高制作效率。完善的工具和流程使得团队能够高效地制作出很多规模宏大且高品质的游戏内容，但是近些年，程序化生成工具和流程也逐渐显现出了一些限制和弊端。
首先，程序化生成的内容往往比较重复和单调。程序化生成通常由技术美术或者技术动画，通过观察归纳总结现实世界的现象效果，来制定生成规则，但是现实世界的丰富性和多样性会使得完全原样重现的规则过于复杂或者代价太高，所以在实际过程中，我们通常会简化规则，而简化规则以后，自动生成的效果就会丢失很多细节和变化。
举一个例子，在真实世界中，植被生长和分布的因素很多，例如降雨量、温度、湿度、经纬度、海拔、光照、风向、土壤环。而当我…</span>

                    <span>回答此问题前，我们可以先看看，其他传统形式是呈现科幻题材的好载体么？
郭帆的影视团队对中国科幻的工业化影视改编做了拓荒性质的探索，团队选取了刘慈欣《流浪地球》这篇2.2万字中篇的其中一段进行了改编。从电影工业化来看，它的置景、服化道和特效真正做到了对叙事的辅助和增强（甚至还在半途成立了UI部门来解决呈现问题），他们的努力使得电影的世界可信、幻想合理，作为当代科幻电影可以说是合格了，但不少观众会批判其人物和剧情过于套路，而另一些观众则认为其格局过小、背离原著精神。
《爱，死亡与机器人》是以动画短篇形式对科幻呈现的探索，第一季18集中的16集背后都有科幻小说原著支撑，包括广受好评的《齐马蓝》。不少观众喜欢其恢弘浪漫的视觉表达和返璞归真的禅意，但原著中作者阿拉斯泰尔·雷诺兹还有一层探讨，是关于记忆的载体，由肉体记录的不稳定记忆和由机器记录的精确记忆，究竟哪一个才是人之为人的关键。有些科幻读者与学者惋惜于这部分探讨被完全抹去，但也有影评人认为这一取舍令此作品封神。
对于最近刚刚上映的《沙丘》意见分化更是严重，路人观众对于一群掌握空间旅行技术的人用冷兵器打群架十分困惑，认为其节奏缓慢、剧情拖沓。但也不乏喜欢其美术风格者，和包括我在内的对其精准还原了原著风貌与精神的科幻爱好者。
而最近火热的“元宇宙”概念，最早来自尼尔·史蒂文森的《雪崩》，这一科幻概念的落地已不再局限于单一载体，而是涵盖了多样载体与技术的现实社会。当然，有人认为这是人类发展的未来，也有人认为这个概念被过度解读，变成了什么都能装的口袋概念。
除此之外，《诗云》的广播剧、《三体》的舞台剧、《闭环》改编的剧本杀《星落五丈原》、综艺节目《火星情报局》等，都是对科幻题材落地形式的探索，但孰优孰劣，相信每一个欣赏体验过的人都有不同的看法。
 


对于游戏载体，这些问题也同样存在。

                    <span>不知不觉在游戏开发行业已过十年，从刚入行的技术小白，到现在依然什么都不懂的技术搬砖工，见证了一个时代的游戏技术变革。我本人先后做过游戏开发SDK，端游MMO，休闲手游，重度手游，大世界手游，大世界端游等各品类产品，现在是天美F1工作室技术中台引擎程序团队负责人。
游戏行业发展很快，玩家对游戏的要求越来越高，游戏对技术的要求也越来越高，开发量也越来越大。我现在所在的天美F1工作室正在开发3A级全平台的大世界游戏，这是一件非常具有挑战的事情。
本人作为游戏引擎程序，深知技术更新之快，需要不断的学习才能接受这个挑战。所幸我们已经提前在多个方向积累了对标国际3A大厂的技术能力，并且还在全球招募了不少具有3A项目研发背景的各方面人才。通过不断的夯实技术基础，我们有能力也有信心接受新的挑战。在我们储备的技术中，PCG的技术是目前大世界游戏必不可少的一种技术，现在做一些简单介绍。
PCG（Procedural content generation过程化内容生成）技术是最近比较热的提升游戏生产效率的一类技术。它是什么意思呢？
网络百科给出的答案：过程生成（英语：procedural generation）是计算机科学中一种使计算机自动制造一类数据的算法。在计算机图形学中，它也被称为随机生成，常用于制作材质贴图和三维模型资源，并在电子游戏领域中用于自动制造大量游戏内容。过程化生成有着减小文件体积、扩大内容量、增强游戏随机性等优点。
我个人的理解：如果在游戏中应用，简单说，过程化内容生成就是利用算法来自动生成游戏内容。原有的游戏内容需要美术和策划花费大量的精力制作，过程化的方式可以大大降低人工成本，除了可以节省一些重复的人工劳动之外，甚至可以自动创作出一些新的设计内容。试想如果有一个程序可以自动生产游戏，那是多么有意思的一件事情，也许那天到来，游戏开发者都下岗了。

                    <span>作为社恐人士，看看我这小眼神就知道我是自愿回答的！


因为直到开播前都很兴奋，所以前几天都没怎么睡，思维到现在都还有点乱，就随便闲聊下吧。


我们跟腾讯动漫算是合作很久了，他们在我们大火鸟还没什么名气的时候就给了很多机会，加上这次能得到《大王饶命》这个项目，真的很感激也很开心。


我还记得当初ASK老师和我第一次说这个项目的时候，我就觉得这是我们团队的荣耀，而且碰巧ASK老师和肘子老师还有我三个都是白羊座,生日还刚好挨着，就觉得这缘分也太巧了。


说来有点不好意思，在还没见到本人前，我以为肘子老师是那种特别严肃的老人家，没想到碰面后反而有种一见如故的感觉。于是我就追着他问了很多关于小说创作的事，一番交流下来，我算是深刻地领会到了什么叫头部作者。


光是我们这几个小时的聊天就足够让我学到了很多平时压根不可能注意的故事创作细节，而且他最厉害的就是可以在极短的时间里想到一段非常有意思的梗，大王第一话开头的吕树怼糖葫芦师傅就是肘子老师几分钟内蹦出来的创意，真的是让人非常佩服。


话说回来，虽说能接到这个项目很让人兴奋，但兴奋劲过头随之而来的就是不安了。因为这部小说的知名度很高，加上肘子老师对我们的期待很高，所以我们必须拿出全部实力去完成它才行。


最终在燃尽了全部精力后，作品顺利上线了，从那刻起，我心里的不安也就渐渐消散了，真心希望大家能够喜欢上《大王饶命》的动画版。


说起动画版的亮点，这两天被大家热议的OP肯定是一个重头戏。实话实说，其实我并没有刻意去做什么布局之类的、与创作无关的事。我只是给了一群爱玩的朋友一个足够的空间，让大家可以在其中尽情玩耍，玩得开心。


我确实没想到会火到这个程度，毕竟我每次做OP/ED的初衷就是让创作者尽情表达自己的创作欲，我相信只有完全释放激情和灵感的作品才是好作品。这也是我为什么特别喜欢跟无念聊创作的事，因为每当我跟他聊起OP时，我能够感受到他眼里是有光的，这是他真心喜欢做的东西，就像他说在制作过程里并没有遇到什么太大的难题，反而更像是水到渠成。


至于正片内容，对我来说比较难的是如何让吕树的怼人场景比较贴合我们的现实世界，因为如果过度追求搞笑效果的话，很容易就会变成那种烂大街的搞笑喜剧。然而这部作品的内核并不是搞笑，所以我们最初开始制作的时候就定下了偏写实的方向，只有这样才能让吕树这个角色显得更加立体。在初期讨论时尤其让我最印象深刻的是ASK老师说“麻烦导演你把第一季做的穷一些，要那种从里到外的穷感。”


真是让人头大.jpg。


一部好剧肯定少不了好细节，我们现在每次要制作新作时，在正式开始前都会去相关地点进行场景、道具的取材，《大王饶命》也不例外，这次为了构建出吕树的房子，我们收集了相当多的资料，所以最后出来的场景美术设定所有人看了都很满意。比较可惜的是我们没能赶上庙会的时间，所以没能体会到原汁原味的庙会氛围，有点可惜。


除了吕树的房子外，像是比较重要的学校场景也在精心收集了很多资料后对它进行了高度的还原，尤其是道元班的设计，我是真的苦恼了很久，最终才定下了方案。而且因为疫情的缘故，在取材结束后我们就匆匆回到了广州，在那之后因为各种原因也没能再去一次，所以后面的很多场景就只能参考之前拍的照片，通过回忆和讨论尽可能地还原了。


最后，再次感谢腾讯动漫，谢谢肘子老师，给了我们这次参与《大王饶命》动画化项目的机会！

                    <span>写在开头
其实笔者本不想探讨关于《一人之下》中人战力高低的问题，因为这类问题往往会沦于骂战，但是看到题主的这个问法“十年空窗期打掉一众十年修为的”，笔者觉得有点意思。
就在此处做一个小小分析，希望各位读者在看待一人之下中的战斗时能够从更多方面去考虑，也算是抛砖引玉了。
先说结论——打架要靠脑子的
张楚岚到底有多强？并不强。
其实细细分析，张楚岚的各方面纸面战力其实都很一般，刨除个别本来就不擅长战斗的同龄人外(没觉醒双全手的吕良），甚至说可以比同龄人还略弱。
但是真正面对战斗时，还包含很多因素，比如战斗智商、心性果决程度、布局算计以及悟性。
而这些非纸面战力，都能够在具体的战斗中扭转乾坤，改变局面。

何谓纸面战力：
包括功法、修为年限、战斗经验、对各门各派功夫的熟悉程度以及肉体和灵魂的强韧程度。
那么张楚岚的纸面战力怎么样呢？
张楚岚现年19岁（虚岁），出生于1997年2月4日，由于并不知道张楚岚是几岁时候得炁开始修炼的，但是参考同龄的诸葛青7岁得炁开始修炼。张楚岚只能更早，假设是在5岁（2001年）。

张楚岚7岁时，张怀义过世（2004年甲申年）。他就停止了修炼，连静功都停止了，从而瞒过公司，一直以普通人的身份活到了19岁。


那么张楚岚的修炼总时长为：2001年-2004年期间，满打满算4年时间。

功法：
金光咒、雷法、老农功【相比其他门派的功法略强】
修为年限：
4年【同龄人10年起步】
战斗经验：
4-5次（罗天大醮期间）【同龄人大多有各门派切磋学习，经验远多于此】

对各门各派功夫的熟悉程度：
龙虎山本门（只教授了术法，没解释含义）、藏龙提供的少量其他门派情报【同龄人大多会有同门长辈传授经验典故】


肉体和灵魂的强韧程度：
由于并非训练肉体的横练或者是性命双修的全真龙门，张楚岚的肉身强度为一般水准，但是灵魂的坚韧强度在同龄人中是出类拔萃的。【同龄人被擤气攻…</span>

I Hate You

SZA

[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y&#x27;all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping &#x27;bout your whereabouts
I can&#x27;t keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don&#x27;t want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can&#x27;t shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin&#x27;
Heavy on the missin&#x27; you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain&#x27;t no findin&#x27; us
I&#x27;ve been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to makе me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just likе this?

[Verse 2]
Used to be too solid &#x27;til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent &#x27;til you ambushed me
Now I&#x27;m out here wildin&#x27; with you
Now I&#x27;m out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin&#x27; boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don&#x27;t ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin&#x27;
Heavy on the missin&#x27; you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain&#x27;t no findin&#x27; us
I&#x27;ve been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape &#x27;Life B4 Fame&#x27; with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.</span>

Continuing from our last post, I talked about how ANSI Game Engine is a colourful telnet server. We left off with needing to fork the engines telnet server.
Time to level up our telnet server and make it multi-player with some knify forky.

I&#x27;ve added in the strftime identifier from Perl&#x27;s POSIX module to help with time stamping the output. The setsid identifier is for starting a new session and group ID for each forked process. A.K.A, the child process. :sys_wait_h is for returning without wait after the child process has exited, using the WNOHANG flag when calling waitpid(). This provides non-blocking wait for all pending zombie children.

A machine learning (ML) model is only as good as its input data. In a world of inequity, developers must ensure they build responsible models void of bias.
Introduction
What is algorithmic bias?
Societal harm
Closing thoughts
As artificial intelligence (AI) begins to integrate itself into daily life, it’s essential that the technology be created for equitable and ethical use. Creating a responsible product is essential and failure to do so can have very real consequences. While neutral in theory, algorithms are at risk to become as biased as the world they were created from.
Algorithmic bias occurs when computers make systematically biased and unfair decisions based on the data they&#x27;re given. AI has the power to be a tool for the implementation of diversity and inclusion in many fac…</span>

Microsoft launched the fully managed Azure service for performance test engineers and developers to perform high scale load testing called Azure Load Testing, currently in preview mode. It is quite a big announcement for performance engineers. Let us see whether Azure Load Testing fulfills our needs or not in this blog post.
What is Azure Load Testing?
As foretold, aptly put, Azure Load Testing is an offering for the customers who are in the Azure ecosystem. Even if you are not in Azure, you can still spin up the load test resource for performance testing. But the catch is, PRICING. We can discuss the pricing in another blog post.

                    <span>One of the advantages of using containers is the ability to have images with our environment pre configured and ready to go with our application code. These images is what allows us to run a container on our laptop and then run the same image on a container in the cloud. But building this images is not a trivial task, and we tend add useless tasks or overhead to the images we create. This entry is to share some of the best practices that has work for me in the past when building docker images.
First of all we need to define what a docker image is. A docker image is a unit of packaging that may includes Operating systems constructs or packages, application dependencies and libraries and application code.

That&#x27;s why the minds behind Range are on a mission to keep teams connected, focused and productive no matter where they&#x27;re working.
Dan Pupius, CEO and co-founder of Range, joins us this week to discuss the need for better, more collaborative tools as work becomes increasingly team and project based. Dan believes software development was the vanguard to the 21st century work model: when a distinction between &#x27;normal&#x27; work and hybrid work will no longer exist because all work will be hybrid work.

                    <span>It was the first day in my last year of tech high school. The new programming teacher arrived and stood silent for a second, and then he started the lesson:
This year we will create a state machine with persistence using C++. This state machine will be a light-bulb that can be turned on, or off.
We all just look at each other thinking &quot;ok, that will be easy&quot;... and then he dropped the bomb:
There&#x27;s a catch: You&#x27;ll not be allowed to use if or for for it.
Now the class was clearly confused. Flow control is one of the first things we all learn as programmers. The main objective of that teacher was to teach us that we need to stop thinking conditions as if, repetitions as for, and so on, and instead be more abstract with the logic on our code. In JavaScript we have:

                    <span>In 2021, we launched product improvements and various community initiatives to help the academic research community succeed in their research studies with Twitter data. In this post, I present a recap of all the API launches and programs - from Twitter as well as the academic research community - that has made it easier for researchers to do research with Twitter data.
Launched in January 2021, the academic research product track is one of the biggest updates to the Twitter API v2 for the academic research community. It provides qualified academic researchers free access to the full-archive of public Tweets (previously, academics had to use the paid premium API to get Tweets older than 7 days). In addition to access to the full-archive search functionality, academics get 10 million Tweets …</span>

西班牙巴塞罗那的圣家堂大教堂，本周在尖塔顶端安装了一颗12角玻璃星，将在新年前夕被聚光灯照亮。这座建筑是联合国世界遗产，已经造了130多年，估计还要好几年才能土建完工。（via）
本周话题：低纬度，高海拔，气候优势
上个月，我在四川旅行。离开成都以后，一路向南，就到了攀枝花。
那是一个很奇特的地方，气候与周边截然不同。

从成都开始，就一直是阴天，但到了攀枝花，天天都是阳光明媚的大晴天。而且很暖和，当时已经是10月底，北方都下雪了，那里白天的最高气温却还在25度以上，可以穿短袖。
总之，天气好得让人怀疑。我就去查了，果然是有原因的，大家看下面这幅中国年平均气温图。

上图中，颜色越深，年平均气温越高（越热）。注意看，在成都和昆明之间，箭头所指的地方，有一块异常的深色区域，气温显著高于周边，比南边的昆明还要高，接近西双版纳的颜色（温度）了。那就是攀枝花。
为什么这里气温高？
书上的解释是，主要原因是独特的地理环境，这里是 &quot;低纬度、高海拔的盆地&quot;。纬度低，接近北回归线，所以冬天不冷；平均海拔1000米以上，所以夏天不热；
更主要的是，这里地处金沙江河谷，周围都是高山，空气不易流动，风比较小，所以比同纬度的地方更热。而且，高山挡住了水汽，所以很少下雨，晴天多。

（图片说明：旅馆窗口望出去的景象，城市被高山包围。）
这样的地理条件，使得冬天的气候非常舒服，暖洋洋的。当地政府现在把康养产业（养老）当作主要产业，一到冬天，大量外地人口涌入过冬。
仔细想一下，国内符合&quot;低纬度、高海拔&quot;这个条件的城市，没有几个的，可能都在云贵高原。这些城市都非常…</span>

引言
作为一部手腕上的计算设备，Apple Watch 能给我们的生活带来很多方便。遗憾的是，Apple Watch 本身的操作逻辑还有很大的改进空间。
例如，从初代 Apple Watch 一路用上来，我始终困惑于为什么操作手表始终需要用到两只手：你必须把佩戴手表的手腕端正抬着，用另一只手在表盘的方寸江山上指点。
即使是在双手空闲的情况下，这么操作也会显得窘迫，更不要提撑雨伞、提重物这种一只手被占据的情况了。（用鼻子或者下巴点过屏幕的读者请举手。）
这个问题终于在今年得到了解决——尽管是通过一种「曲线救国」的方式。在 watchOS 8 中，Apple 将多种新的「辅助功能」带到了 Apple Watch 上，其中就包括 iOS 用户熟悉的「辅助触控」。
在辅助触控的帮助下，用户可以用捏指、握拳等手势代替触控操作；换言之，用一只手就可以使用 Apple Watch 上的所有功能。
先来看看 Apple 的官方介绍视频：
 
是不是颇有些「呼风唤雨」的魔术色彩？
诚然，「辅助功能」的设计初衷是方便那些有肢体不便的用户，但这并不意味着普通用户不能从中受益；从某种意义上说，「一只手被占用」本身就是一种肢体不便的情形。本文中，我们就将介绍如何利用这一新增的辅助触控功能，单手掌控 Apple Watch。
注： 请注意「辅助触控」功能仅适用于 2020 年起推出的型号，即 Apple Watch Series 6 或以上，以及 Apple Watch SE。
开启手势和基本操作
启用 Apple Watch 的辅助触控功能其实只需简单几步。在 iPhone 上打开 Watch App，进入「辅助功能」&gt;「辅助触控」，然后打开「辅助触控」开关。接着，点击「手势」，再打开其中的「手势」开关。

@SHY：时间是 2011 年，舞台是美国佛罗里达州。空条徐伦在与恋人兜风途中遭遇交通事故，而后被律师与法官联手陷害，因谋杀罪获刑 15 年，押入别名「水族馆」的州立绿海豚街重警备监狱。束手无策之际，徐伦却从父亲空条承太郎托付的护身符中觉醒了不可思议的力量。然而，将家族秘辛和盘托出的承太郎，在营救徐伦越狱时因失去主角光环遭到敌人暗算，沦为失去替身和记忆的植…</span>

                    <span>作为不记账就会焦虑星人，我在使用 iPhone 时曾大力赞扬 MOZE 这款记账应用，不是因为 MOZE 有多强大或多完善，而是它具备了许多特别人性化、符合实际情况的功能细节。
在回归 Android 平台后，我一直在「吹毛求疵」般寻找记账应用。可无论是大厂知名产品还是无数来自独立开发者之手的优秀作品，使用起来它们都有地方会让我皱一下眉头——并非是不够强大（有的产品甚至可以用于资产管理），而是缺少了那些贴心细节。所以当我体验到小星记账时，那些细节让我产生了一种「平行时空里的我开发了这样一款记账应用」的错觉。
基础功能常规但足够好用
从应用本身来看，小星记账仍然是常规的记账工具，它将账目概览、账户信息、统计报表这三个核心功能分成三个页面展示，低频和进阶功能则收纳进了侧滑菜单，整个记账流程足够顺畅，账目类型、金额分类以及附属信息在一个屏幕中就可以完成，结合规范的 UI 设计，日常使用使用起来逻辑感很强。
不过有几个地方也能看出来小星记账有它自己的想法，比如它没有像大多数同类产品一样提供日历视图，以及它将四则运算收纳进了数字键盘的二级菜单中，记账老手们应该会比较不习惯，不过体验一段时间之后我发现，这两个功能似乎并没有我想象中那样常用。

记账是为了了解自己的消费习惯，所以定期查阅详单和报表非常重要。小星记账在报表方面的逻辑也非常明确：概览和图表一目了然、详单可以通过筛选查看。小星记账也提供了收支差额（可以看作结余）的计算，另外每类图表下方还会「一言以蔽之」简要概括这段时间的财务状况。详单部分也比较完善，对应大类、小类、账户或者不同时间段的结余详单都能查看到。最近一次更新后小星记账在搜索功能中新增了「高级筛选」，用户可以通过自定义时间、金额、分类、账户等等信息筛选对应账单，完全可以满足我们统计和对账的使用需求了。

除了常规功能，小星记账支持报销管理和周期事件，更新后也在记账页面提…</span>

                    <span>按：今天是 12 月 3 日，国际残疾人日。根据世界银行的数据，全球约 10 亿人患有某种形式的残疾。
诚如联合国在今年纪念活动的说明中指出，技术和创新越发促进着可访问性（accessibility）和可用性（usability）；辅助设备和辅助技术对于残疾人士发挥着关键的「促进平等」作用。其实，早在 2006 年，联合国通过、中国参与签署的《残疾人权利公约》就承认，获得辅助技术是一项人权。
在少数派，我们关注技术，也强调包容。在内容出品中，我们重视推广无障碍设计、介绍辅助工具的选题；与读者互动时，我们常常感动于那些虽然视听、行动不便，但依靠坚忍与才智活出别样精彩的故事。
值此残疾人日之际，我们特将网站中无障碍相关的优秀内容以合集形式呈现，希望为促进无障碍方面助人和自助的意识和技能，略尽绵薄之力。

一、无障碍技术综合讨论
怎样打造互联网「无障碍」

互联网为很多人打开了认识世界的另一扇门。对于残障人士来说，互联网不仅仅是丰富生活的方式，更是为了让他（她）们全身心投入到工作、生活、沟通、聆听、创作的桥梁。那么，为了实现这种互联网「无障碍」，厂商、社会组织都做了哪些努力？信息无障碍应当满足哪些标准？不同操作系统的无障碍设计和教程资源应该去哪查阅？本文一一为你解读。

我们为什么要关注包容性设计

包容性设计（inclusive design）是「一种能够充分利用并实现人类多样性的方法」。它包含无障碍设计，但又高于无障碍设计。世卫组织指出，残疾是一种个人属性，不仅仅只是健康问题，而还是一个环境问题，反映了身体特征与社会特征之间的相互作用。因此，每个人都可能在某种场景下成为「残疾人」。这篇译文从设计角度出发，探讨了包容性设计的实践方式，但对于任何用户都可以产生启发和触动。

《瞎玩菌的游戏周报》是我对游戏领域的观察和点评。具有以下特点：

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

游戏本身就是一种互动娱乐，我非常鼓励读者通过评论互动参与进来，而不是仅仅当个「读」者。

奥密克戎至少有32处变异，而之前的德尔塔不过是2个变异。
但这里我需要澄清一个广泛存在的误解，所谓的32处变异指的是通过基因测序，但这并不代表奥密克戎的刺突蛋白的外形的变化一定就会大过德尔塔。

对身处蒙特利尔的从业者来说，中国游戏公司在规模和投入上的准备程度是以往很少见到的。这种投入往往意味着可以打造极好的团队，而好的团队是好作品必不可少的。中国研发工作室的到来无疑为蒙特利尔注入了新鲜血液。

就我个人而言，决定加入天美是个天时地利人和的故事。此前，我在育碧蒙特利尔待了近 15 年的时间，有意尝试新的项目和环境。
天美蒙特利尔工作室的 AAA 项目恰好是我感兴趣的类型。深入交流后，我发现双方志趣相投，也都希望打造一部好作品。综合考虑下，我来到了天美蒙特利尔，这里的一切正处于启动阶段，充满挑战与活力，让我感觉非常兴奋。
目前，我负责为游戏设计概念图，探索游戏的美术风格和基调。由于仍在项目早期，所以人数尚少的概念美术团队可以充分发挥想象力，互相交流与克服困难，相互尊重专业，氛围非常融洽，我觉得这是个很好的开始。

AAA 游戏的概念设计
大家也许会好奇，AAA 游戏的概念美术设计过程是怎样的。其实并没有想象中复杂，我仅分享自己的一些个人经验。
概念美术设计的第一步，往往是从美术总监处，得到关于设计需求的简报。我会根据这份简报，去尽可能提出问题，理解对方想要的画面。在这之后，我会去寻找各种参考素材，主要用于以下层面：设计，氛围，配色，光影，构图，灵感 …… 进而我要决定用什么路径方法。

而路径方法的选择，取决于概念图的类型和目的：是用来展现氛围，还是具体设计？是游戏故事中的…</span>

                    <span>大家好，又是我。
我是《大王饶命》的动画监制askask，感谢大家对这部动画的关注，希望大家喜欢这部动画。
关于原作
 我在知乎也混了挺长时间了，感觉知乎的网文用户还是挺多的，所以第一个问题就先来说说原作吧。
其实我并不能算是一个传统的网文读者，除了很多年前追过一阵子紫川这种极早期作品之外，中间一直都没有关注过网文作品，《大王饶命》这本书老实讲也是因为工作相关才开始看的，但没想到一看就喜欢上了。那已经是几年前的事了，其实因为这本书我才去下载了起点app，然后这几年开始越来越关注新的网文作品，也追更了很多新的好书。
熟悉我的朋友可能知道我是一个极老极老的“老二次元”了（可能是很多人阿姨辈的那种），这本书给我的第一印象就是非常适合“二次元”方向的改编，不管是人设、剧情、战斗体系的设定等各方面。熟悉国漫的朋友应该知道我们现在的动画改编还是有很大比例是倾向于使用3D制作的，但《大王饶命》这本书我是看完之后马上确定了使用2D制作，并且很快敲定了现在的动画制作团队，简直是太合适了。
在制作中原作的改编其实有两个比较大的难点：一是搞笑，二是战斗戏。关于搞笑的问题上其实我们纠结了很久，可能更多的原著粉在看书的时候脑补出来吕树的怼人和比较贱的态度是会比较直接和更有冲击力的那种，但从人物的长线塑造和剧情角度考虑，我们还是处理成了现在的风格，前期PV放出的时候也注意到有些原作粉感到有些意外，但相信慢慢看下去，大家会逐渐理解我们的用意！而战斗戏份则是我们这一季重点打造的部分，尤其在后半进入遗迹之后，会有大量非常大规模的精彩战斗场面，为了这部分的制作导演已经跳楼几次被人民群众抬了回来（不是），最终还是让原作者替他摔断了腿（纯属胡扯）。没有啦，不过头发掉了大概有几车应该是真的。

关于OPED
这两天提前放出的OPED相信大家已经看到了，也掀起了不小的反响。

                    <span>从07年初到现在，已经快15年了。还在这一行。就从我自身的经历说说行业这些年的变化，以及未来的趋势吧。
第一份工作是在完美世界，进去的时候公司还叫完美时空。那时候全国比较知名的游戏公司是盛大、九城之类的代理公司，大型的游戏开发公司还是很少的。完美时空那时也只有200多人，上线的项目只有完美世界、武林外传、诛仙。直到我入职半年后公司才在纳斯达克上市，随后迅速扩张起来。
那个时期可以说是3D端游刚刚在国内兴起，只要有技术能做出画面不错而且网络稳定的3dMMO，市场基本是随意收割的状态。完美当时采用的快速复制新产品抢占市场的方式，虽然被诟病为完美七胞胎，但确实是最适合当时国内游戏市场的打法。

当然，好日子没几年就开始变了，入局MMO的公司越来越多，一次重要的转变是史玉柱的征途登场，买卖数值的模式越来越成为网游的收入重心，自动寻路等小白的操作和刺激玩家PK也渐渐取代了探索大世界的游戏内容为主的设计方式。

另一个则是完美的老对头畅游的崛起，天龙八部的活动玩法和卖宝石等也迅速成为跟风对象。这两家京城游戏公司互相挖角也堪称一乐，双方的核心骨干基本都对着换了N次家。
这个阶段大概持续了五六年左右，在业内的体验基本是MMO游戏的画面技术在提高，但设计整体在下沉化和氪金化。对那些怀着初衷要做暴雪式游戏的国内开发者来说，大多会感觉日子越来越不好过和行业世风日下。然而谁能想到再过几年真的暴雪也要黄了呢。
但是随着竞争的激烈，因为大家都做了活动、卖数值，pk，社交这些容易模仿的下沉设计，这些设计也很快失去了异军突起的效果，于是大厂也出现了一股下血本提高品质的浪潮，不再急于推出项目，而是反复打磨游戏内的画面、战斗、副本等内容，以靠近国际水平。这时候有代表的作品比如腾讯的斗战神，西山居的剑3，网易的天下，完美的笑傲江湖等。如果按这个趋势发展下去，中国的端游确实是有可能走向国际3A的道路。
可惜这个趋…</span>

                    <span>先说结论吧，在射击游戏的领域，游戏策划的门槛确实在逐渐提高。工作以来我一直在从事射击游戏的设计，快8年了，我自己也是FPS游戏的重度爱好者，能把爱好与工作完美的结合也是一件幸运和开心的事儿。那么就从射击游戏领域的游戏策划工作，聊一聊这些年面临的一些挑战吧。

射击游戏一直是游戏的一大分支，从TGA近5年的获奖者来看，包含射击元素的游戏几乎占据了半壁江山，‘枪车球’的地位显而易见。并且每隔1-2年，都会有突破性的射击游戏产品诞生，TitanFall、OW、PUBG、2077等无一不给玩家带来相当程度的震撼。而像COD/BF这类超高质量的年货产品，更是牢牢占据领先的位置。射击品类可谓百花齐放。
 


而作为一个非常成熟的品类，在全球研发领域，射击游戏已经有了近30年的研发历史，无论在设计理论、技术成熟度和生产管线上，都已经有非常惊人的积累。国内的射击游戏研发真正爆发，也大约是从BR（BattleRoyal）时代开始，越来越多的工作室投入了射击品类的研发，而国内最早一批自研射击游戏的项目，可以追溯到2008年大连金山团队的反恐行动，到逆战迎来了更大的影响力，紧接而来的手游时代将竞争战场转向了移动端。

短短不到10年，国内的厂商通过努力似乎来到了弯道超车的拐点，但在移动端的超越更多是来自“端转手”的红利，随着越来越多的端游在移动端移植完毕，真正考验作游戏设计者的创造能力/设计能力的时代慢慢来临，能够脱颖而出的产品越来越难，尤其是在全球化市场的竞争中，新的手游甚至要以端游的品质或体验为目标，才能在这个时代获得成功。

天美J3工作室在移动端做出了《使命召唤手游》《穿越火线手游》这样的射击游戏作品，在玩家和市场上都取得了不错的成绩，一群热爱射击游戏的人一直在这个方向积累深耕。
随着射击品类的快速进化和走向全球游戏市场，我们也在布局新的产品方向，在开放世界、写实大战场和风格化游戏等领…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是 Steven Rhee，韩国人，是一名坐标北美的灯光美术（lighting artist）。个人曾在 EA 和动视等公司任职，积累了 15 年的游戏光照设计经验，目前加入天美洛杉矶工作室，从事 AAA 项目研发。我不懂中文，所以请天美同事帮忙翻译，给大家分享一些我的看法。
大家也许已经注意到，中国游戏厂商正在全球各地成立工作室，招募当地的 AAA 人才。在我看来，这本质是研发全球化的必然趋势，而且西方早就开始了。
过去十年，游戏已成为当前科技领域最关键，最具创新能力的行业之一，为全球近 20 亿人提供了极具沉浸感与惊艳感的娱乐形式，也让“娱乐产业（entertainment industry）”这个词不再限于指代好莱坞和电影。
随之而来的是，游戏研发的规模在不断扩大，尤其是对 AAA 级游戏而言，幕后成员往往超过上千人，需要多个工作室合作开发，才可能将游戏在规划期限内完成。早在许多年前，Rockstar Games、EA、育碧等厂商就已经开始在本土之外布局研发团队了。

经过长时间的积累，不管是从中国市场还是全球市场看，中国游戏研发进展迅速。面向全球市场，中国游戏行业自然向着 AAA 游戏研发领域扩张。游戏公司也在通过全球化研发布局的方式扩充人才池，提升团队多元化程度，来建立自己的竞争优势。
在个人层面，我认为研发人才加入新的开发环境是件很正常的事情，特别是受到资源、能力、决心的吸引。比如我，在跟天美接触中没有过多犹豫，我觉得加入天美会极大地帮助我个人的成长。
全球协作研发和团队多元化
我曾在 EA 和动视工作，负责多款游戏的光照效果，包括《星球大战：前线》以及《麦登橄榄球》，《战地》和《极品飞车》等系列。
其中的 13 年里，我一直都是《麦登橄榄球》系列的灯光主美，因此与 EA 上海工作室有过多年的协作研发（Co-dev）经验。

协作研发有不少优势，比如说…</span>

                    <span>我从事游戏行业17年，先后任职于上海育碧和蒙特利尔育碧, 从PS2，Xbox时代的游戏开始，经历了PS3，PS4，Xbox 360，Xbox one等的变迁，也参与过多部当时所谓的“次世代”作品，比如《幽灵行动》，《I am alive》，《细胞分裂》和《孤岛惊魂》系列等等。做过关卡，VFX/shader TA，技术美术总监，期间负责过多个项目重大对外节点（如E3，gamescom等）的攻坚。
接触天美J3还是2019年的时候，当时美术总监 @BrianTao 和技术总监 @Shadow 找到我，给我展示了目前在研的几款游戏，我为手机上能呈现如此的品质而惊叹！
要知道出国前我对手游的印象还停留在《愤怒的小鸟》和《部落冲突》这类休闲品类上。之后我们又谈到了工作室今后的规划和发展，“大世界”，“工业化”是提到最多的关键词，这也正是与我过往的经验和想做的事不谋而合！
由于疫情关系，我最终在2020年底回国，有幸加入了天美J3大家庭，目前担任技术美术负责人。
说到工业化，虽然我经历过多款AAA“次世代”，但是从游戏的内容量品质，团队人员配置和流程上讲，它们同样有着天壤之别。行业也已经在过去这段时间里经历了几次重大革新。  记得早些年，在主机上（如PS2，Xbox）开发第一人称射击游戏，团队规模往往在百人以内，开发周期在1年左右。开发流程上也非常线性和简洁明了，比如游戏分为多个关卡，每个关卡由各自的关卡设计和关卡美术负责，在技术美术总监的指导下，效果得到艺术总监认可，性能在规定范围内就可以了。
至于里面的细节，只要不是违背大的技术框架，可以由该关卡的负责人按照自己的习惯就行，而资产（source data/raw data）管理，流程管理等也并没有规定得那么死板。在开发中遇到的问题，可以通过非常灵活的定向研发的方法逐一攻破。

                    <span>很多年前我在知乎给过一个论述，今天再稍微做一次复读机：
工业水平决定爆款上限
受众特质决定爆款呈现
囿于写这个论述的时候，我对于游戏产业的工业化其实理解是有一定偏差的。所以今天我对这个论述稍微修正一下：
在创意行业中，工业水准决定表达形态。
当然还是要说明，我自己并非游戏开发，本职工作现在更接近发行；很多涉及开发本身的事情我的回答会显得班门弄斧，请大家多多指正。
-
如何定义工业化？
我的定义就是在项目上建立高效的自动化系统，拥有成熟的开发技术栈，优化的开发工具，并利用成熟的系统高效地生产游戏内容。
工业化其实更多是生产方式的区别，重点在于效率的提升，而并非是产出的游戏本身的大区别。——在这个意义上来说，某些大作其实并非工业化生产，或者最多是纺织工人用上了珍妮纺织机，但离真正意义上的工业化生产，还有很多距离。
回归到问题“如何看待工业化对游戏产业发展的重要意义？“本身，在这个回答中，我想谈三个事情。
其一，是产能的提升。
产能其实是两个维度，第一是能做什么，第二是同样的时间能做多少。
实际上是存在一个反-工业化的叙事的。那就是“小作坊”生产。而大家都在鼓吹工业化生产，或者至少认为工业化生产是一个好东西的时候，我们面临的现状是大多数的游戏开发都以小作坊式生产为主。
这个倒不是说大家条件艰苦云云，而是说开发模式还是以堆人力，怼资源的模式为主。
在这种情况下，决定产品上下限的，都是团队整体每一个人的能力。在这种情况下来说，人员的稳定性和能力水平就非常致命。
同时，团队能力的下限也在非常大的程度上决定了你能做什么样的东西。
而开发的工业化在一定程度上是能够解决这个问题的，成熟的开发管线可以让内容的生产效率更高，也让内容生产更不依赖于某个/些特定人才。
这点在于游戏产品质量需求提升明显的今天，是尤其重要的：尽快完成开发工业化的厂商/工作室，一方面能够更快的追随市场的喜好，生产表现力更强的游戏产品；另一方面则显然能够有更大的腾挪空间，对市场的适应性更高。
其二，是管理模式的改变。
工业化的生产，势必引领更工业化的管理模式。这点在逻辑上还是很明显的。产能提升其实能够显著避免micro-management。项目管理的重要性也越来越多。
倒不是说某一种或者某几种项目管理模式就一定行。但以往关键角色一言堂的情况，在更高的产能下，其实会有一定的衰减——因为在高产能的环境下，leverage资源比对项目直接bb要更紧迫。
囿于我本身并非管理者，所以我对于这点的诠释并不全面。但我能够清楚且欣喜地看到，工业化能够带来的是更先进，也更能发挥每个人能力的管理模式。
其三，则是成本以及行业场景的远期变化。
有群友回答说，未来的游戏行业会有明显的两极分化现象。这点我非常同意——但是原因跟工业化的生产方式其实关系不大。更多的原因在于需求的变化：即使是在F2P领域，玩家亦需要表现力更佳的“大”游戏。
诚然，对于多数厂商来说，将自己舒适区内的开发模式更替为更工业化的开发模式，确实会有段时间的成本上升以及转型的阵痛。但长期来看，工业化的产能是能够在一定程度上降低成本的。
君不见EA，Ubi等等海外开发商，即使在海外他们的人力成本已经跟国内持平甚至更低了。但单纯从开发能力来看，国内还没有哪家公司敢说他们比海外厂商强的。
更近一步讲。即使对于个人/独立开发者来说，工业化体系下催生的产品，也会对他们的开发提供便利——君不见，Unity的普及让我们其实前所未有地容易开始做游戏了（当然真不真的去做又是另一回事）。
这最终导致的是游戏开发的商业电影-艺术电影分化，不肯找到自己真实地位的厂家被大浪淘沙。

                    <span>感谢邀请。确实，从目前趋势看，国内各大游戏厂商和工作室都陆续在海外布局，在海外设立自研工作室并大力引进海外高端人才。海外工作室的建立，可以一定程度上进行产能扩容，减轻游戏内容的研发压力。
更重要的是，海外一线专家的加入，可以带来老牌游戏开发商在高品质内容生产上的方案和经验，对于快速完成生产管线改造和核心研发能力升级上有比较大的参考意义。对于国内游戏厂商来说，加入全球化研发无疑是加速团队成长与探索AAA生产模式的机遇。
但挑战总是与机遇并存，全球化研发的趋势对游戏研发团队和个人，都会带来更多新的要求。不论是国内的游戏工作室，还是海外游戏厂商，目标都是建立“快速量产AAA品质游戏内容”的能力。只是各自的原始积累不一样，努力的方向也不尽相同。
对于我们来说，想在游戏研发全球化的大趋下守住优势并脱颖而出，不论在技术与工具的积累和探索上，还是在生产模式的摸索和迭代上，都应该以兼容并包的心态，吸收国内外的先进经验，快速建立自己的产研优势。
我们工作室在技术革新和前沿探索上一直比较积极，我自己也经历过数次大规模的技术升级和管线改造，目前也在负责新项目的技术迭代的规划和落地，可以分享一下我们在这个过程中的想法和经验，希望能提供给大家作个参考。
准备一：搭建工业化管线 — 流程标准化与生产自动化
随着玩家对高品质游戏内容量的需求增长，未来精品游戏项目的研发必然需要超大规模团队的承载和支撑，也呈现着跨地区多团队配合的趋势。这也正是全球化研发的本质。
跟单一团队生产不一样，跨地区多团队的联合研发，对于生产流程标准化的要求会非常高，以避免低效沟通带来生产成本的极大代价。
海外厂商在多地团队联合研发上有其经验和优势，值得我们借鉴和学习。 同时在游戏内容生产方面，自动化生成代替纯人工生产也将成为大趋势，通过程序化的方式可以大幅减少在内容生产上的人力成本，并提高整个项目的研发效率，以适应市场的快速变化。…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计专家Inkling，年轻人都喜欢叫我in老师。我从剑3开始职业生涯，在腾讯J3参与过逆战和穿越火线手游，可以说，国内原创科幻游戏的星星之火正是由我们这拨人点燃的。
我从小喜欢画画，更是个资深游戏玩家，从04年走出校园踏足游戏圈到现在，见证过国产游戏辉煌的成功，投身过行业中激烈竞争的战场......既然说到游戏美术的竞争力，我有些简单的想法想和大家分享。

这个问题之前，我觉得先需要回答下什么是游戏美术，什么是美术。如果一说到游戏美术，大家只能想到引擎和渲染的话，那这个行业未免有点无趣。
美术是一个大概念，游戏美术和其它几千年传统行业的美术，没什么本质区别。
做的都是让 —— 大到世界，小到物件 —— 的外表“好看”的工作。
让东西变好看的能力，每个人都有吗？如果我有这样的能力，怎么才能比别人更强？
我觉得可以从三个方面去说：执行，判断，观点。美术的竞争力就是提高自己这三个方面的优势，游戏美术也一样。

执行
执行就是实际美术工作的熟练度，执行力就是控制的能力。控制的能力就是让元素出现在它们该出现的地方，能够让色彩不乱，线条漂亮。疏密关系、明暗对比，这些已经是老生常谈，真正落到实处的时候，就是经验和练习量。
基础的战斗力，没有太多大道理可讲，选择行业需求的方向，尽最大可能花费时间锻炼。不管是软件技能还是绘画技法。所谓一万小时定律，说的就是机械的能力，而机械的能力就是靠机械的时间积累获得的。
实际执行能力的竞争，无非就是投入时间的赛跑，同样资质的人，多投入时间的一方一定会胜利。资质不好怎么办？那就投入更多时间试试。同时也要注意，专注在一件事上是对的，但是也需要留意其它领域，一专多能 vs. 一专，永远有优势。

判断
判断就是能知道什么是好看的，什么是不好看的，有审美。这个已经超越了美术范畴，审美和一个人的知识储备和阅读量密切相关。
我们不可能期待…</span>

                    <span>我是在传统老牌的西方 AAA 公司工作 15 年后加入中国游戏研发工作室的，我结合自己的观察和体验，尝试回答这个问题。
近几年，中国的游戏公司有很大的变化，逐渐向重视原创、追求更高品质、打造具有中国文化特色的游戏产品转变。最近经常听到这样一句话“中国游戏玩家的口味越来越高，国内的游戏公司也开始卷起来了。”
“卷”这个词用在这样的语境下，我认为不是件坏事，它代表着随着市场需求的变化，中国的游戏厂商对于品质的重视程度变得越来越高。
国外的 AAA 厂商已经这样“卷”了十几年了：游戏的画面越来越接近影视化，内容丰富度和体量越来越高，争相进行技术上的探索和突破，同时创新的作品也层出不穷。我很高兴看到中国的游戏公司也以这样的方式“卷”起来，让中国的游戏产品在各个维度上与国外的 AAA 大作掰一掰手腕。

我相信这样的转变，对于许多海内外从事 AAA 游戏开发的人才选择加入中国游戏公司，是一个至关重要的前提。 
AAA 游戏的开发是一个先慢后快的过程。一个非常有经验的 AAA 游戏团队，也可能要花费 1-2 年的时间来完成概念和创意方面的探索，2-3 年左右的时间进行试生产（Pre-production），这里主要包括设计方面的验证和技术管线的搭建。
所以，经常会出现游戏开发了 4、5 年，看起来却只有一个垂直切片以及一大堆白盒和临时资源的情况。但接下来会是神奇的一段时间，通常 80% 的游戏内容，都是在最后的 1 年到 1 年半时间里完成的。
这种“神奇”有一个前提条件，就是整个团队可以沉下心来，完成前面提到的创意设计和试生产环节，否则最后的全面投产（Full-production）将会是一场灾难。
每一部 AAA 游戏的开发都是一趟漫长的旅程，耐心，信心和决心三样缺一不可。而我已经在国内的游戏厂商中看到了这三样东西，所以我回来了。

                    <span>游戏是我从一而“衷”的选择。我大学毕业就一头扎进了游戏行业，从业至今，由一名普通设计师成长为主美，大约16年多点。这份选择从最初到如今或是将来，都不会变，所以在这里，我用了衷于初心的“衷”而不是终点的“终”。
游戏和动漫是我的两大爱好。与很多80后一样，在成长的时光里，我都是在棚里看别人玩《魂斗罗》，或是在街机厅打《街霸》中度过的。记得在作文作业里，我还写过一篇从8位机开始一路到当时的SFC 32位机的游戏主机发展史这种让老师一脸懵逼的作文。所以，我自认为一直是一名游戏爱好者。但可能喜好更偏向于动作，冒险且有剧情的游戏类型。
与此同时，我对动漫的热情也从未减少。因此在读书阶段，自己的休息和考试奖励基本都是被允许画漫画和游戏里的角色。后来，我有了让中国动漫形象席卷全球的愿望。这个愿望或许有些太大了，但自己始终在期盼这一天的到来。
大学毕业答辩时，我的论文题目是《如何推广中国卡通形象》。当时我感觉国内在这块的整个产业链还不完善，想要从动漫衍生出高认知，高流传度的形象或是文化理念会比较缓慢。所以在论文里，我是把游戏这样一个商业化相对成熟的产品放在第一推广位，然后再同步动漫周边等。这也是为什么我会直接选择游戏行业而不是其他行业。
入行后，我在第一家公司做的是手游，现在自己仍在开发手机游戏，感觉有些事情可能确实讲究点机缘。加入腾讯之前，除手游外，我还参与过PC和各类掌机，以及08到11年期间所有主流主机游戏的开发。但始终我都在做欧美向的设计。
直到进了腾讯，我才真正开始参与到国人自己的游戏研发中去。然而在刚开始的时候，我参与的项目在美术风格上依旧是偏欧美的。
直到2012年末，我在天美开始参与第一批风格全民化的微信游戏开发。从那时起，通过一个又一个的项目，我才逐渐将自己的美术风格往亚洲审美上靠。
最终在17年8月，我们研发的国风战争策略手游——《乱世王者》顺利上线了。（以下简称《乱世…</span>

                    <span>Old or new to the crypto world, you have probably already met with some cryptocurrencies. But how about creating one? That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do in this tutorial.
First, what is ERC-20? Some kind of android? No! Besides the difficult name, it is just a protocol to define what basic structure, rules and functionalities your fungible token (like crypto currencies) must have to properly interact with the world. But good news! You don&#x27;t have to write it from scratch, because OpenZeppelin already has a bunch of secure boilerplate smart contracts written and audited by the community developers, so you just have to import it in your code and extend your contract so it inherits the ERC-20 basic properties and methods.
To properly interact with the world your token needs some basic rules, such a…</span>

                    <span>After solving a Advent of Code challenge by treating the input as a program last year, I wanted more this year. The opportunity came today and I decided to take it. Instead of Parlet and Ruby, though, I decided to use Elixir/Erlang tooling to get the job done.
In the Day 2 this year you need to pilot your submarine. This is done by a series of commands, such as this:
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2

We have a command, followed by a number - one pair per line. There are three commands:
forward moves the submarine horizontally by number


down moves it down, increasing the depth we&#x27;re at
up does exactly the opposite of down



A series of commands - that&#x27;s a program! To execute it, we need basically 3 things: a lexer, a parser and an interpreter. Fortunately, Elixir gives us…</span>

1. Common HTTP request that we will use
2. Inheritable and non-inheritable properties in CSS
3. HTTP respond Header 
4. Common HTTP respond status code

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

Using LottieFiles you have a choice to make your own animations using Lottie Editor, buying animations from creators on Lottie Marketplace or using Free Animations to get LottieFile(s) completely free of charge to add them into you project.
Unfortunately, Lottie animations cannot be added directly to SwiftUI view without some work prior to that. In order to add Lottie animation to SwiftUI, you need to implement UIViewRepresentable protocol which is a wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate Lottie view into your Sw…</span>

                    <span>Starting with a new framework can be really tedious sometimes. Don&#x27;t get me started about the starter files you have to build. 
In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to set up tailwind css easy peasy, without having to dig too much through the internet. We&#x27;ll start from making sure you have node installed in your computer, easy/awesome terminal tricks, right down to making sure you are set to start using tailwind in your code.
Side note: You do not need any knowledge of node to use tailwind. We&#x27;ll just use it for necessary installations.
To check if you already have node installed, then run the following command in your terminal.
node -v
If node was previously installed, then it should display the current version after you hit enter. If it wasn&#x27;t, then you&#x27;ll have to install node. You can get…</span>

                    <span>Optimising code for high performance can be exhausting; where can you squeeze that last bit of speed out of your code? How can you be faster than that one piece of code you found online?
For that, let&#x27;s take a look at the following example of our Rust crate:
pub fn new(values: &amp;Vec) -&gt; MathVector {
    let mut len: f64 &#x3D; 0;
    for i in values {
        len +&#x3D; i * i;
    }
    MathVector { values:    values.clone(),
                 dimension: values.len(),
                 length:    len.sqrt() }
}

Among other things - like the for loop for example - one thing is the problem. Can you spot it? The answer is: len.sqrt(). Getting the square root of a number is performance-wise extremely expensive - how should we get rid of it? You might guess, that we could implement something like the…</span>

Dustin Moody is a mathematician in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security Division, where he leads the post-quantum cryptography project. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 2009. His area of research deals with elliptic curves and their applications in cryptography.
In this episode, we talk about the resignation of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and Apple’s new self-service repair announcement. Then we explore the looming threat of post-quantum cryptography.

                    <span>Since starting as a full time SWE, I&#x27;ve found myself using multiple note-taking apps:
Notion. Mostly use for meeting notes. I love the organization and search features. I love that you can add attendees and other properties. But the tablet app is painful to use with a stylus. And because it&#x27;s so structured, I&#x27;m less likely to add notes that don&#x27;t fit in a predefined section.
Samsung Notes. For daily tasks and reminders. This replaced the Cambridge Quad notebooks I used to buy in bulk. I bought a Samsung tablet, and now I&#x27;m stuck. The handwriting recognition is the best of multiple apps I&#x27;ve tried. Unfortunately the people at Samsung make it impossible to access and edit your notes on desktop or the web.
OneNote. Which I&#x27;ve been trying to use because it&#x27;s there and easy to save random screenshots to. But the lack of basic editing features and plugins sucks. The forced notebook and page structure is also pretty limiting. I hate clicking around to find notes and the view easily feels cluttered.
Random sticky notes. For random thoughts, customer service case numbers, git commands to refer back to, etc.
I would love to use one app that does everything these 4 apps do:
Organize my notes into groups and structures that I can easily search and get back to
Be workable on tablet. I&#x27;m not asking for much here. Just let me take notes. Recognize my handwriting and let me edit on desktop or the web.
Simple interface that doesn&#x27;t inhibit random notes or reminders I want to jot down.
Someone suggested Obsidian. Never used it before, but would love to get some feedback from those who have. If there&#x27;s another app that you swear, please let me know!

                    <span>A product&#x27;s ability to capture the user&#x27;s attention is crucial, and dynamic prompts/notification is one such efficient way to engage users.✨
It allows you to communicate with users by directing their attention to the navigation bar and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for announcing business news, showing off the best features, generating leads, and so on. 
This article will guide you step by step to build your own Dynamic Prompts/Notifications bar. 👩‍💻
We used React for the frontend, Canonic for the Part backend.

Lets start with creating a new react project - Use create-react-app

Next, to create a basic skeleton, just edit src/App.js

I asked a question whose answer I would like to share. I am not a professional transcriber or translator, so take that into account when reading the following answer.
Adolfo Neto: Do ​​you particularly prefer statically typed or dynamically typed languages ? If it were just for taste, not for saying what&#x27;s better or worse for developers.
José Valim: Dynamically typed. I agree a lot with the response from the creators of Erlang. When someone asks &quot;why isn&#x27;t Erlang statically typed?&quot;, a lot of people say it is &quot;because the theory for statically typing ever…</span>

@南鱼祭酒：realme Book 海岛灰
买这种手机厂商推出的首款笔记本电脑，是需要一定的勇气的。对于我来说，做勇士，其实是一个明确自己需求的必然结果。

购买渠道：realme 京东自营旗舰店
入手价格：4399（原价 4699）
下单及签收日期：10 月 27 日下定金，31 日付尾款，11 月 1 日发货，3 日收到

我一直有台式 Windows 电脑兜底，所以在笔记本方面只需要考虑轻薄即可。上一台 win 本是 vaio z，在 19 年底的时候 C 面有一点点鼓，就送回京东返修了（京东自营，我作为京东 plus，不修白不修），结果京东表示修不好，可以按购入价八折赔付给我，然后机器销毁。用了一年半的笔记本能有这样一个结果，对于消费者来说显然很值了。于是在之后的一年时间里，我的移动设备就变成了一台华硕的 Chromebook 和 iPad Air 第三代。这样的组合在家里当然无所谓，但是一旦要出门，一旦要出门而且要跟他人进行文件交换，Chromebook 和 iPad 的不足就体现出来了。恰逢苹果推出了全新的 M1，于是我在 20 年年底斥巨资购入了一台 MacBook Air M1 16+512（官网 24 期分期免息，四舍五入不要钱……）。
但是，在接下来的将近一年时间里，我发现 MacBook 并不适合我。

最值得称道的高性能 M1，我用不上。笔记本在我这里主要作用就是文档编辑器 + 浏览器，M1 杀鸡用牛刀了。
高续航我用不上，甚至轻薄我也用不上。我在今年（21 年）4…</span>

                    <span>12 月 2 日，App Store 正式公布 2021 年度 App 奖项。与去年一样，今年的 App Store 年度 App 奖项分为「年度 App」「年度游戏」「年度趋势」3 个部分；不同的是，今年的年度 App 奖项由过去的「App Store Best of」正式更名为「App Store Awards」。
在 App Store Awards 2021 奖项名单中，每个部分各有 5 款 App 获奖，获奖的开发团队同样会收到一块由 Apple 设计和制作的实物荣誉奖牌，奖牌背面会刻上获奖者的名字；奖牌由 100% 可回收再生铝合金制造，设计灵感来源于 App Store 的蓝色图标。

注：以下 App 仅标注 Apple 生态支持平台，部分应用和游戏还支持更多平台，你可以自行前往 App 官网进行了解。
年度 App
在年度 App 奖项中，我们能够看到许多少数派读者的「老朋友」，比如之前多次介绍过的笔记工具 Craft 以及天气应用 CARROT Weather 等等。
年度 Mac app：Craft

App Store

以精致设计和动效著称的新兴笔记工具 Craft，在推出的一年多时间里获得了 App Store 与国内外媒体的多次推荐，也是 少数派评选出的 2020 年度 App，也在今年获得了 Apple Design Awards「交互」主题奖项提名。

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

关联阅读：设计精美、功能强大，Apple 用户的文档工具新选择：Craft
 
年度 iPad app：LumaFusion

                    <span>快捷指令的加入拓宽了 macOS 自动化的疆域，但只有「随叫随到」的自动化才是有用的。好消息是，macOS 上快捷指令的运行方式相比 iOS 有增无减，不仅可以融入 Dock 图标、菜单栏等 macOS 专有的界面，而且还能与 AppleScript、终端命令等传统自动化途径打通。本文将结合实例，整理这些运行方式的设置方法和适用场景，帮助读者将快捷指令安置到最合适的位置。

                    <span>如果是 Steam 忠实老粉，那么 Wallpaper Engine 你应该也不陌生。这款 Windows 的动态壁纸软件，可谓是把 Windows 桌面和 Steam 社区强大的生产力结合在了一起 —— 桌面壁纸动起来了，似乎也给 Windows 增加了一份动感。不然，每天盯着死气沉沉的 Windows 方格视窗，也真的是有些腻。
不过如今，Wallpaper Engine 也登陆 Android 了。
熟悉的配方，熟悉的味道
在 Android 设备上，Wallpaper Engine 默认仍然保留了几个经典的壁纸，比如「Fantastic Car」「Razer Vortex」和「Neon Sunset」。这些壁纸也都为移动设备的屏幕大小做了优化，同时可以在应用内一键设置为锁屏或者主屏幕壁纸。难能可贵的是，桌面版对于壁纸本身极高的自定义程度也在 Android 版本中得到了保留：以 Neon Sunset 为例，用户可以自定义各种颜色、比例以及播放速度，自定义程度完全不输 PC。
除此之外，移动端 Wallpaper Engine 支持「对运动作出反应」—— 你可以选择让壁纸根据手机陀螺仪读取数字的变化而变换，有点儿像 iOS 的「透视」效果；也可以通过在不同主屏幕之间切换来滚动显示（比较适合横向的动态壁纸）。

此外，Wallpaper Engine 在 Android 上也支持通过播放列表的形式自动更换壁纸。在主页的某一款壁纸上长按，就可以把它添加进入播放列表。播放列表可以设置为按照顺序播放或者随机播放，并且可以设置每款壁纸持续的时间。
当然，我们也可以选择设备上的 mp4 视频、gif 动图或者是照片等，来通过 Wallpaper Engine 创建自己的动态壁纸。说不定你可以把自己家猫的卖萌视频做成壁纸，再加入播放列表循环播放～

文字版 📝
在上周刚拿到这把少数派定制的联名 Keychron K3 并简单拍了段视频分享到一些社交平台之后，不出所料，我收到了蛮多相似的疑问：
「为什么我们还需要一把矮轴机械键盘？」
和传统的机械键盘相比，矮轴机械键盘确实算得上是个新事物，从罗技 G913 把这类产品带到主流市场以来也不过三四年时间。但另一方面呢，不管是 TTC、凯华还是佳达隆，国内几家轴厂也都相继推出了矮轴产品。所以我们第一个话题，就来聊聊矮轴键盘到底好在哪。

虽然伴随着游戏和电竞行业的大热，机械键盘席卷外设圈十多年，但仍然有不少用户坚守着薄膜键盘的阵地：相比于前者主打的指尖爽感，也有一部分人对于更轻松快速的输入体验更加在意。
直白点说，不管是线性还是段落，传统机械轴体 4mm 左右的键程在长时间使用之后是会有一点「腻」的，所以为了结合机械轴体和薄膜键盘各自的优势，矮轴机械键盘诞生了——保留了机械轴的触发原理，但是大大降低了轴体高度和按键行程，使输入体验更加贴近薄膜键盘的轻松高效，同时也保证了一定的机械键盘的手感。

我拿到的这把少数派定制 K3 是佳达隆矮青轴版本。在相比传统轴体大幅缩短的 2.75mm 键程里，这把键盘依然可以感受到清晰紧实的段落感，之后也有足够的键程来完成柔和的触底，而不至于像薄膜键盘一般在「敲钢板」。偏大的回弹力度也比较符合我的喜好，段落声更是短促且清脆（打字声实录可以参考视频 3：35 处）。
当然手感是一件见仁见智的事情，矮轴的诞生姑且算是给了部分用户追求敲击感时一个折中的选择。在此之外，这类产品还有另外一个显而易见的特性，也正是这个特性使其进一步对应了非游戏人群的办公需求——肉眼可见的轻薄使得矮轴键盘类产品在便携性上有着得天独厚的的优势。

相信我派有不少存在如此困扰的读者——对于经常带着笔记本电脑甚至是 iPad Pro 出差并且码字比…</span>

前言｜拍完的照片怎么办
拍完的照片怎么办？这个问题困扰了我很久。
长久以来，至少对于业余摄影师，朋友圈、即刻、图虫等等就是照片最终的归宿。我后来发现更糟的是，翻来覆去不过是换个平台传上去而已，最多一周以后就再难有人问津，包括自己。想想连家里那些落灰的旧影集，时不时还会被拿出来翻翻，我就觉得这些新鲜的记忆不能埋在网络里就算了。
我不专门学摄影，也相对少交流，过去几年都在瞎拍，这种草根性一定程度上影响了我了解「摄影集」这一概念的进程。从「影集」变成「摄影集」，好像专业度提高了不少。
绕了很多弯路，也庆幸得到了很多帮助，我最终完成了。搜了搜我派上没有系统的教程，仅有一篇 @kokdemo 前辈所做的台历教程，读后也觉得受益匪浅，经历了许多相似的困难。我许久没码字了，这次抛砖引玉但从头到尾地聊聊怎么做一本摄影集。

以下内容可能比较业余，只是分享过程。
挑选｜重新翻一遍库存
作为一个毫无资历的小法师，我无法指导大家拍摄，更多是如何挑选一系列适合放进摄影集的照片。如果你一直有非常好的图片管理习惯，那么这一步就会非常容易。要是没有的话，做本摄影集其实也是个很好的开始，挑选的过程本身也是图片管理的过程。

当然要符合自己的审美，选自己最喜爱的那些照片。

在中国现有的五座“世界美食之都”里，顺德是最特殊的。澳门的后缀是“特别行政区”，成都、扬州、淮安的后缀都是“市”，只有顺德的后缀是“区”。看起来，顺德似乎天生就比其他四位低上一级，更像一个“小地方”。很多人不知道的是，站在顺德区背后的，是佛山市——如果说顺德这个“小地方”，是粤菜皇冠上的明珠，那么佛山，就是皇冠本冠无疑。由高明濑粉、禅城柱侯牛杂、西樵牛奶浸鸡、大良野鸡卷、勒流水蛇羹、九江煎堆、三水蛋散、白坭冬瓜盅、伦教糕、石湾及第粥、盐步秋茄、三洲烧鹅、均安蒸猪、陈村粉等等所组成的佛山版“报菜名”，不仅反映了这里丰饶的物产和讲究的烹饪艺术，更彰显了深植于地理人文之上的，源远流长的饮食传统。

在大多数人眼里，佛山是一座与黄飞鸿、叶问、李小龙高度绑定的城市，在文弱谦退的中国南方，它是少有的，被打上了尚武、悍勇标签的地方。一个不易察觉的细节是，这三位“武林高手”，似乎都没怎么饿过肚子：黄飞鸿十六岁开设武馆给人授艺，生意始终兴隆，早早当上了老板；叶问十七岁赴香港读书，接受西式教育，电影《叶问》一开场，他就过着喝茶、练武、住别墅的神仙日子；而李小龙，则从出生起就是美国华侨，在移民热土旧金山的独栋独院里长大。在那个多数中国人都挣扎在贫困线上的年代，这三位佛山人毫无疑问是“人上人”的代表。



事实上，有钱有闲、生活洋派，不仅是黄飞鸿、叶问和李小龙的个人状态，更折射了佛山地区一直以来的富庶和开放。佛山的地理位置很特殊，珠江最重要的两大支流：西江和北江在此交汇，它们带来了南岭山区的大量腐殖质，并冲击出一片河网密布的巨大三角洲。相比上游城市清远、肇庆，佛山的土地平旷而肥沃；相比下游的江门、中山和珠海，这里又因为远离海洋而没有海蚀侵袭、土壤盐碱化的困扰。对农耕文明来说，这是一块不可多得的宜居区。

                    <span>是否有领导力，可以按照领导力的定义判断，这里给出一份领导力模型的参考，主要包含做「事」、做「人」以及整合「人」和「事」三个层面

「事」的层面
核心能力1： 项目推动能力（关注问题识别和推动执行，强调对外）
子维度包括： 

敏锐洞察：随时了解竞争对手和业内同行的动态，敏锐识别市场机会和风险，通过分析性、阐释性、评鉴性思考，集思广益，解决问题；制定的方案经得起时间的考验；善于发现创新想法。 
追求成效：具有不屈不挠的进攻精神，不达目标绝不放弃，坚定不移地推动自己和他人为取得成效而努力。 

核心能力2：任务分解能力（关注资源调配和规划分解，对内） 
子维度包括： 

目标分解：围绕任务目标，组织下属制定计划、分解目标，讨论和优化工作开展方式，使效率提升并保障任务的完整执行。 
资源整合：面对市场机会，果断决策，合理配置人力、物力、预算等资源，指导并带领下属团队以最快的速度达成目标。 

「人」的层面
核心能力3：沟通和跨部门协作能力（对外）： 
子维度描述： 

沟通能力：以积极主动、换位思考的思维方式和娴熟的沟通技巧，妥善处理与他人的关系，促成相互理解，获得支持与配合。
组织影响力：针对组织内外部情况，使用复杂的策略方法，产生影响，营造良好的内部工作氛围和外部合作环境，以完成工作目标。 

核心能力4：人才培养能力（对内）： 
子维度描述： 

选才育人：慧眼识人，发现和关注有潜力的员工；付出时间和精力支持全公司的高潜力人才发展。 
组建高效团队：通过授权、激励等管理手段充分发挥团队成员优势，促进团队合作，解决人员冲突，激发团队成员的动力，营造良好团队氛围。 

整合「事」与「人」的专业精神
核心能力5：专业精神
子维度描述： 

把事情做到极致：不断挑战更高标准，超越目标，在互联网领域创造出更为持久和非凡的成就。 
拥抱变化：面对复杂多变的外部环境，不畏难、不退缩，主动调整、寻求改变，引领团队朝着新的具有挑战性的方向转变。 

正如领导力大师约翰.科特所说，“管理是确定具体的计划，然后配备人员等组织资源，并监督和控制执行过程；领导则是确定长远的方向，联合群众朝着此方向前进，并激励和鼓舞他们。” 领导力不是领导的专利，领导力是一种影响别人的艺术。所以，我们每个人无论职位高低，无论是否管理者，都可能随时在某种场合扮演“领导者”的角色，影响我们身边的人，都需要“领导力”。

                    <span>动画明天就上线了。
本来我还兴高采烈的准备追更，结果腿突然摔断了，只能躺着追更了……
很多人会私下问我，动画好看不好看，大家都以为我是看过了的，其实没有。
我还没有看过动画，只是制作的过程里看过一些分镜，参与了剧本的创作。
我始终认为，专业的事情一定要由专业的人来做，我虽然是原作者，但我擅长的是文字表达，而不是动画语言的表达。
对此，我是完全的信任监制、导演、创作团队。
现在，我作为原作者，其实就像普通观众在等新番一样，比较激动。
昨天看到op之后更激动了。
这个op是我近几年看过最好的，从作画精致程度、设计之巧妙，都让我眼前一亮。
而且，我还自己参与了一部分作词……
如果有个什么“年度最佳op”的评选，我感觉这个op一定可以入选……
当初刚与腾讯动漫、大火鸟合作的时候，他们就专门来了洛阳。
一开始我还挺担心沟通会有问题，毕竟行业里资本支配原作者的传说屡见不鲜，哈哈。
但后来发现我多虑了，监制ask和导演少爷都很好沟通，都是超级有意思的人。
沟通基本就是在吃吃喝喝、欢声笑语里结束的。
其中聊了怎么把握大王饶命里的人物关系，怎么把握搞笑元素的呈现方式，剧情脉络。
大家都很尊重原著，甚至过于尊重原著。
我一直在跟他们聊，原著从文字转换动画，肯定要有所改变，所以未必要全都按照原著来……
但ask和少爷对此很谨慎，他们怕丢失了原著的味道。
所以总体来说，整个动画制作过程对我来说，是开心且愉快的。
最后，希望明天动画上线后可以大火大爆哈哈，毕竟我献祭了一条腿，一定要制霸一整年！

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
在之前的文章里，就提到过勇士的防守死穴：对上真正顶级天赋的大个子，他们的体系会被强拆。这也是勇士以夺冠为目标情况下，面临的最大隐患。而今天对太阳的比赛里，这种更多停留在“讨论”阶段的隐患，终于露出了危险的一角。全场比赛，在防守端，108.3分的百回合失分也远差于大样本下联盟第一的100.4分。
而将勇士的防守打到这个地步的，是布克或保罗的挡拆持球攻吗？布克只打了15分钟，保罗的回合占有率也只有18.2%，并没有像惯常预计的那样，接过布克留下来的球权，包揽一场比赛的进攻。真正让勇士无法防守的，是中锋艾顿，打出了远远超出常规赛20.2%水平的30.1%回合占有率，真实命中率也保持在57.8%，而他的得分方式却并没有比平时有所进化，83.3%都来自于油漆区，且两分球受助攻率72.7%，依然是我们印象中的那个出手范围较为狭窄的篮下终结点。

更多需要控球手“喂饼”的艾顿，常理上讲似乎不应该成为勇士防守的障碍，反而是勇士最喜欢的那种进攻方式。本赛季的勇士，将小阵容提到了常规使用的程度，正牌中锋鲁尼只有18.3分钟的时间，18.8分钟的奥托波特、14.9分钟的别利查，分别在五号位打了53%和100%的时间。这套小阵容对上线持球人的压制能力极强，几乎可以在任何对位中都不被抓住防守弱点，且可以兼顾到对侧翼的轮转。对持球人的局部空间以人数压缩，对侧翼依靠轮转补位，外扩的防守风格可能出现的篮下空虚问题，则由对持球人的传球线路的封锁来缓解。由此，勇士便做到了对对手进攻组织与串联的切割，对发动机有重点施压，对弱侧也有人员顾到，让对手无法通过个人威胁与顺畅传导盘出足够合理的进攻回合，被迫打成高难度的单打和出手。
本赛季，勇士有53.9%的防守回合处在篮下15FT以外，集体外扩程度排名联盟第四。而在效果上，与勇士对阵的球队场均只能拿到21.6次助攻，联盟第四，被防到42.…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://www.zhihu.com/question/470254023/answer/2009702302?utm_campaign&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_content&#x3D;title">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>其实把“野外露营”和“精致露营”作为对比选项，就像把“西餐”和“水果”拿来对比一样，在概念的内涵和外延上，怎么说都有点“差辈”。


基本上，露营可以分为三种：


第一种，Bushcraft露营，更倾向于荒野求生。
Bush是澳大利亚对森林的称呼，Craft则是技能的意思。所以Bushcraft也就是那种住山洞，或者拿树枝搭个窝棚，最不济带一块油布搭个避难所的露营。

这是回归原始生活的一种露营，什么现代化工具都没有，什么钻木取火了，什么用树皮做绳索了，什么拿木头挖陷坑了，玩就玩最野的，没有足够的知识、经验、体魄、意志，是做不到的：
赤身裸体户外露营，夜晚如何取暖御寒_哔哩哔哩_bilibili

当然，在国内，怎么钻木取火荒野求生，那都是动嘴的，实际上绝大部分Bushcraft爱好者连公园都没睡过，真动手的都是买买买，什么2000块钱的英国手工斧子，什么1500块钱的美国煤油灯，什么3000块钱的瑞典柴火炉。没钱的就买什么战术鱼钩、钛合金火柴盒啥的，逐渐沦为COSPLAY艺术、手工艺品收藏，和YY了。

这其实不是Bushcraft露营，而是Bushcraft风格露营，也就是牛奶和牛奶风味饮料的区别了。


另外从环保的角度说，古人这么露营是没办法，从现代露营的角度来说，明明是从大都市开着越野车进林子，明明有20块钱、200多克一个，一个能用两天的气罐不带，非要带好几斤重的斧子去乱砍树木，破坏环境，就为了烧起一堆柴火感觉很炫酷，我个人是对此相当持保留意见的。



无痕山林的准则，不说全都对，但既然你要去露营，最好还是要了解一下：
1.事前充分的规划与准备，
2.在可承受地点行走宿营，
3.适当处理垃圾维护环境，
4.保持环境原有的风貌，
5.减低用火对环境的冲击，
6.尊重野生动植物，
7.考虑其他的使用者。





第二种，经典露营/常规露营。
也就是最为我们熟知…</span>

Welcome to another Marley Rainbow Six Siege best funny moments video, full of waffle, one taps, aces, and clutches... But the main focus is trying the new meta, not shotgun meta, but the sniper meta! Operation High Calibre is out but before we try out the new operator Thorn and the new gun, the Uzi, I wanted to see if we would vibe with Kali and Glaz.</span>

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are not FOUR hunters but FIVE instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost AND my friend awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It&#x27;s a race, and it&#x27;s super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we&#x27;ll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

                    <span>Introduction
Push notifications are alerts that are &quot;pushed&quot; to a user&#x27;s device by apps, even when those apps aren&#x27;t open. In the case of web push notifications, the web app receives messages pushed to it from a server at any time. This includes when the application is active or inactive or not open in the browser and when the browser is inactive. Firebase Cloud Messaging is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send these messages at no cost.
In this tutorial, we are going to be walking through how to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging to receive web push notifications in your React.js app.

                    <span>If the mobile app doesn’t correspond to the latest design trends, it will probably be out of users’ interest.
Making the app look modern and beautiful is challenging, considering that trends never stay the same, and there is always a new trend to appear. But following the design trends is a must for every app developer.
We understand that It is not always possible to keep track of all the tendencies and trends in the industry. There are always new guidelines, animation content, video, new approaches to illustrations, and many other concepts you need to find time to study and test first.
We have completed this task for you and collected 10 top design trends and ideas to use in 2022 and make your apps’ design stand out:

                    <span>Tailoring a user experience for different devices can get complicated. There are many approaches to rendering a different view for mobile, tablet and desktop users.
This post presents a way to offer a tailored render for different breakpoints in the same component.
The benefit of this approach is useful when you need to render the same content components in an app and have them render a specific set of HTML based on viewport size.
Firstly, the breakpoints need defining. This sets the viewport widths and the render function to use at this breakpoint.
const breakpointConfig &#x3D; {
  reactive: false,
  breakpoints: {
    992: { method: &#x27;renderTablet&#x27; },
    768: { method: &#x27;renderMobile&#x27; },

                    <span>Sometimes mining can seem to be too complex for the average computer user, so I thought about putting together a quick guide to get you excited about mining cryptocurrency and LINK in particular.
Anyone can start mining Chainlink LINK with any laptop in under 5 minutes using this guide, regardless of your technical skill level you will be able to increase your crypto knowledge and start mining LINK with your CPU and GPU today!!
Chainlink is a decentralized blockchain oracle network like Tellor built on Ethereum. The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts.

Continuous integration, continuous development, and ANOTHER CD. As expected in DevOps fashion, the two CDs are often treated interchangeably. In reality, they need to be set apart as their own processes. If organizations want to be bleeding edge and match the productivity of large corporations like Amazon, Facebook, and Google - hopefully not their arguably unethical coding practices - they need to embrace all three facets. The final CD is seen as somewhat of a unicorn in the industry as of now. However, it is gaining levels of normalization at select firms.
So what are all three tenets?
We will walk through each step and their implementations with specific open-source tools and their respective use-cases.

                    <span>Factory Method(virtual constructor) provides an interface for creating objects in a super-class, but defers instantiation to sub-classes.
Consider an application which has to access a class, but does not know which class to choose form among a set of sub-classes of the parent class. The application class can’t predict the sub-class to instantiate as the choice might depend on numerous factors, such as the state of the application at run-time or its configuration.
The Factory method pattern solves this problem by encapsulating the functionality of selecting and instantiating the appropriate class inside a designated method, which we refer to as the factory method.
The factory method pattern can be used in cases where:
A class can not know or predict the object it must create

                    <span>Lately, we started a project to improve the performance of our main app. We identified a few API calls we were calling a lot. Results of these calls can change but not very very often so it&#x27;s not an issue to cache the result for a minute or so.
So I implemented a very easy cache that will reuse active promises and returns already resolved results for a minute after an initial resolution.
This article will go over the code in detail.
function getData(key){
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    console.log(&#x27;starting get &#x27; + key)

    setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {

Easy enough.
Now we need a few variables where we store our promises, results, and resolution times. We will also create a new function that …</span>

Say whatever you will about the world of app creation, but there is no denying that it is exceptionally vast and contains practically endless possibilities within itself. 
What is important here is the fact that the vastness of possibilities the world of app creation provides is what allows you to enter it seamlessly. And, even more than that, it allows you to create great life-improving applications and significantly improve your finances as well.

While I’m still a junior developer through and through, I’ve started to get more comfortable with where I am at. Looking back I can see a lot of things I wish I had done differently, which is great, to be honest. Being able to recognize that I’ve changed and grown as a developer is fantastic. 
I previously wrote a post about some of the common mistakes that junior developers make. Since then, I’ve come up with a new list of mistakes I see myself and others making, so I thought it was the perfect time to write a second part. Without further ado, let’s get into it!

In this project, we&#x27;ll be using Tailwind - CSS framework, that&#x27;ll help us in rapidly building the interface for release notes.
Next, by using npm, we install all the tailwind dependencies and set up its configuration file. 
All you have to do is follow the simple instructions at tailwind CSS documentation.

                    <span>冲动购买 Flip3 之后，我遇到一个大问题。
我之前的两台手机都有双 SIM 卡支持，以至于我完全忘记了「实体双 SIM 卡也是一个特性」这件事。到手前一小时我才发现，这块小家伙不光没有大电池，还没有第二张 SIM 卡的容身所。本着不要多花钱的原则，我试着用了几天闲置的 iPhone 6s，可它实在服役太久，换过的电池和屏幕相继出问题。实在忍受不了点击不到的边角按钮和用到 40% 就突然消失的电量的我，做了一个现在看起来非常差劲，甚至有点离谱的决定：
我买了 2018 年上市的黑莓 KEY2，满足自己对实体全键盘最后的执念。

实体全键盘，遗失的美好
其实购买的时候，我就没对它抱有多大期望。因为即使成色再新，它也是一部 2018 年发布的手机了。我当然还有其他选择，比如发布时间更近的 Unihertz Titan 与 Pocket，可它们一来配置没有优秀多少，二来那块正方形的屏幕据说会带来不少兼容性问题。综合考虑下，现在市面上的全键盘手机，最适合我的就只剩下 KEY2。想来稍微有点悲哀。
有朋友说 TCL 代工的黑莓已经不再是原汁原味的黑莓了，但 KEY2 的外形与手感仍然带着我熟悉的味道。骁龙 660 处理器，和我因为卡顿淘汰的坚果 Pro 2 一样。我这么说可能有些奇怪，但这两部手机都像是对千篇一律的圆角直板全触屏提出的抗议，当然下场也一样，它们都停留在时代进步的扬尘里。相比之下，坚果可能还显得更先进一些，KEY2 基本就是电子设备的活化石。

我到现在还是认为，对于大部分一般消费者来说，黑莓的意义就是那些黑莓一样的小小按键。这也是到手之后我急着确认的第一件事。作为持有 9790 的前黑莓用户，我并不觉得 KEY2 的键盘手感有什么明显的差距，除了那一颗空格。不知道是不是因为集成了指纹识别器，它的晃动十分明显，打字时都能明显感到跷跷板。至于其他小键，在我看来和 979…</span>

🏆 Users’ Choice 2021 榜单出炉

到了十二月，今年的 Play Store 的应用评选榜单 Users’ Choice 2021 也照例发布。
按照惯例，今年的 Users’ Choice 评选出的 App 虽然对于大部分国内 Android 玩家讲未必全是熟悉的应用/游戏，而且不同地区之间的奖项也略有区别，但作为 Android 最大应用分发平台 Play Store 每年推出的评选，这份榜单往往具有很强的「时效性」，能反映出过去一年 Android 应用生态以及全球社会的各种变迁，因此仍有很多看点。
值得特别注意的一个改变是：今年应用榜单针对 Google TV、Android 平板以及 WearOS 手表等泛 Android 平台应用，为其加入了专属的评选奖项，让这些原本一直属于相对「边缘化」的应用需求也终于走上台前，得以被更多用户所知。这也与 Google 近两年一直在推动的改变不谋而合。
游戏部分，《宝可梦大集结》（Pokémon UNITE）与《英雄联盟手游）（League of Legends: Wild Rift）这两款国内玩家也不会很陌生的现象级游戏也很自然地榜上有名。

后续我们也会推出关于此次应用评选结果的专题文章，敬请期待。

                    <span>少数派会员今年 6 月 1 日正式上线，到现在已经整整半年了。对于这个新生的板块，我们一方面满怀信心和诚意，同时也深知经验有限，无法一开始就尽善尽美。因此，会员上线以来，我们始终没有停止过搜集反馈、回顾反思；会员计划的内容和形式也经历了诸多微调。在此特别感谢已经购买会员并给我们提出了宝贵建议的朋友们。
站在这个半年的节点上，我想亲自跟新老会员聊聊会员计划的成长历程，谈谈我们目前为止的发现和思考，希望大家耐心看完。

从梦想到实践，少数派付费内容的早期尝试
尽管「内容免费分享」的理念似乎已经根植于互联网文化之中，但这种模式是以早期小规模、精英化的互联网生态为前提的。在用户多元化、信息爆炸以至冗余的当下，「既要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草」是难以保证持久、优质的输出的。尽管内容从业者通过各种方式绕过付费这道坎，希望通过推广和带货来为内容生产输血，但实践表明这种模式并不容易形成稳定循环，潜在利益冲突也容易侵蚀媒体的信任根基。
基于这样的思考，我们很早就开始尝试探索健康、公允的内容付费模式。早在 2017 年、少数派的商业前景尚不明朗之际，我们仍然坚持投入大量心血，推出了第一套付费教程——《用更现代的方式做任务管理：Todoist 完全使用指南》。
当时，少数派不仅没有专门的付费栏目模块，连支付系统也尚未建立。然而，凭借教程本身的质量和忠实用户的信任，我们依靠一篇介绍文章、一个收款表单，也获得了五万元的销售收入。
五万元不算多，去掉给作者的分成，留给网站的收益更少。但这次尝试为我们验证了教程内容的价值，给了我们信心在内容付费这条路上走下去——哪怕再小众的领域，都有付费内容存在的空间；这本来就是少数派应该做的事。
第一次成功的试水后，我们在之后的一年中陆续推出了 设计课、信息管理 等付费栏目，受到了不少好评。但与此同时…</span>

                    <span>前言
如果没有亲自尝试过下面这款 App，你可能会对这个画面感到迷惑。它既不简单，又不复杂；你不知道它究竟能做什么，但它看起来又不是完全无法预测，毫无规律。

这个 App 的全名是 Uzu, An Interactive Light Show。简单来说，它充分地利用了 multi-touch 多点触摸屏的特性：根据触点的个数及其移动轨迹来给予用户不同的反馈，让屏幕上的发光粒子跟着你的手指上演一场流光溢彩的灯光秀。
如今，multi-touch 对于大多数人来说早已不是什么神奇的技术，但在 iPhone 和 iPad 刚刚诞生的那几年里，它却如同魔法。当 Jobs 在舞台上首次展示如何在 iPhone 上利用手指「推动」一个菜单列表，从而实现页面滚动时，观众的惊叹就说明了一切。
自诞生以来，iPhone 就被认为是当之无愧的「智能」手机，即 smart phone。而 smart 这个词，除了「智能」以外，更有一层「耳聪目明」的意思。从 multi-touch 屏幕，到加速度感应器，再到后来的罗盘仪、原深感摄像头系统，历代 iOS 设备无不体现着这样对外界变化的灵敏反应。而宽大多彩的屏幕，又从输出的方面丰富了人们对「手机这个物件能做什么」的期待。
这些神奇的技术当然吸引了众多的 App 开发者。不同于今天强调专业性或「生产力」的市场，在早期的 App Store 中，大量的 App 都是「炫酷为主，功能为辅」，处处强调着这些新设备为 App 开发给予的极大灵活性，从而也吸引了一批又一批的新用户购入了他们的第一台智能设备，其中也包括我。
直至今日，当我们回顾这些功能简单，但制作精良的 App 时，我们仍然会被它们的「浪漫」所打动。它们体量不大，但总能做好自己的一件事，在如今看来就更是难能可贵。幸运的是，它们中的一些直到今天都还能在 iOS 15 上运行，让大家有机会随着我的这…</span>

成为一名优秀的声音工作者，并不是一件易事。而能够变现，其实更是难上加难。要想达到专业程度的有声书录制，还是建议至少要准备电容麦克风+独立声卡+配置尚可的主机。笔记本由于散热问题可能会突然起飞，所以不是很推荐，必须要用的话也建议放得远点并且和麦克风隔开。大机箱风道相对较好，日常使用自然不会有太大的噪音，如何选择还是建议看个人情况。

大部分的专业声卡都是为音乐工作者所设计的，比如说像乐器输入接口就完全用不到。而且稍微可用的价格都小几千，初期整体投入没个大几千下不来，不是一般人能承受的。

正好哥们最近就开始录书了，这半年也是把家里的儿童房改造了下，虽然是匆匆忙忙上场但是现在也够用了。来让我们看看这个录书工作角到底是如何配置的吧，如果有入行的兴趣建议收藏下避避雷。

                    <span>下班回家再看，不过作为“JOJO小鬼”，我觉得第六部的替身都非常值得一说，我是说这些替身名字的来源。一个一个来。
Stone Free
从第四部荒木老贼开始使用欧美音乐（专辑or单曲）作为替身来源开始，其主角的替身往往都有着非同一般的意义。第四部的“Crazy Diamond”是来自Pink Floyd的专辑《Wish You Were Here》的《Shine On You Crazy Diamond》，这个歌曲贯穿整张专辑，长达26分钟的大长篇；而第五部的“Gold Experience”这是来自老贼最喜欢的歌手之一Prince的专辑《The Gold Experience》。也就是说，主角的替身选用，老贼是有很大的私心的，基本都是他极为欣赏的。
而到了第六部，也是延续了这个思路。老贼给空条徐伦的替身《Stone Free》正是吉他之神Jimi Hendrix在The Jimi Hendrix Experience乐队时期所创作的《Stone Free》，所在专辑为《Are You Experienced?》。

课后提问，第五部也有一个用Jimi歌曲当替身的人，请问这个替身使者是谁。
Goo Goo Dolls
替身名字源自同名美国另类摇滚乐队Goo Goo Dolls，也可能来自乐队首专《Goo Goo Dolls》。这支乐队在国内知名度并不算太高，其实在国外首专和二专名声也不是很响，直到那首歌的出现直接让Goo Goo Dolls一炮而红，即《Iris》，还是因为尼古拉斯·凯奇主演的《天使之城》。

Manhattan Transfer
荒木老贼涉猎广泛的代表，你以为只有摇滚乐队？上来就是一个合唱团。名字来自美国爵士合唱团The Manhattan Transfer。
所以后来《第八部》有了流行音乐的Born This Way也算是意料之中了。

Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It is an expression of culture, our parents&#x27; love and a means of celebration or comfort. That’s why it hits a special nerve when we are told we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change. One of the most delicious foods, meat, gets the worst press. It doesn’t help that the topic is really hard to properly research yourself and debates get emotional quickly. But clearly science can give us an answer! 

The reality is, well, it’s complic…</span>

Filled with new life experience, two more Grammys than last year, and a few less of her infamous one-liners, Billie Eilish truly is happier than ever. From hosting the Met Gala to being the reason Oscar de la Renta no longer sells fur, watch to see how much Billie has grown since her first interview in 2017 with Vanity Fair.

                    <span>Lately, I&#x27;ve been tending to lean more towards employing a monolithic approach in system architecture. On paper, using micro-services seems like an ideal solution. The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I&#x27;ve watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.
I&#x27;m not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn&#x27;t really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.
So my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?</span>

                    <span>Let me start by saying.... I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING.
Literally, developing a game engine is not on my resume... yet! So any code or ways of doing anything you read here, is just what I&#x27;ve figured out and works for me, which by no means should suggest to you that it is the proper way to do what ever it may be. Please consult your local guru first.
OK, now that we have that established... Please consider the following as entertainment and should you lean along the way with me, that&#x27;s wonderful!
Now, by the time of writing this article, I am several months into this undertaking. I&#x27;ll describe in future posts what the engine is capable of, but for today, let me tell you about what happened over the last 2 weeks. I will likely break them up into separate posts for easier consumption.

                    <span>Video is one of the best ways for capturing audience attention. Product demonstrations, property tours, tutorials, and keynotes all make great content—provided that they’re readily searchable by your team and visitors alike. Even though tagging and categorization help organize videos and make them easy to find, the labeling process is labor intensive, taking time away from key tasks like creating new videos.
The solution? Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content. Video tagging extends image classification to image sequences, capable of detecting types of scenes (cities, mountains, the seaside) and objects (people, cars), and even inferring whether the content is appropriate for public viewing.

, we wanted to give you a massive kudos for bravely sharing your story of exhaustion throughout the interviewing process. I invite everyone reading this roundup to take a look at Sam&#x27;s post as I&#x27;m sure we can all relate to the feelings shared there. DEV is a place to be vulnerable and we&#x27;re honored when you feel supported enough to do so.

                    <span>Functional components in React are most beautiful because of React Hooks. With Hooks, we can change state, perform actions when components are mounted and unmounted, and much more.
While all these are beautiful, there is a little caveat (or maybe not) that is a little bit frustrating when working with useEffect hook.
Before we look at this issue let&#x27;s do a quick recap on the useEffect hook.
The useEffect hook allows you to perform actions when components mount and unmount.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // actions performed when component mounts

  return () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // actions to be performed when component unmounts
  }
}, []);

The callback function of the useEffect function is invoked depending on the second parameter of the useEffect function.
The second parameter is an array of dependencies. You…</span>

                    <span>Bienvenidos a un nuevo post de experiencias siendo developer. Mi nombre es Axel Valdez, licenciado en diseño de interacción y multimedia en la UADE,  actualmente UI designer y frontend developer en Circular.
En este post les voy a contar la experiencias de cómo fue la experiencia de haber sido desvinculado, o despedido según el país donde viven, de una empresa/agencia. La idea de este post es acompañarlos en forma de guía para que sepan que cosas hay que hacer y qué no durante todo el proceso.

                    <span>Just wrapped up Day 2 of Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent and from the Midnight Madness concert, to building an AI-Powered Image Processor during Talia Nassi&#x27;s workshop, to catching up with the amazing Adrienne Tacke from MongoDB....there is a TON going on Vegas! 
In this episode of the Tech Stack Playbook, I&#x27;ll be sharing more about AWS re:Invent - the year&#x27;s largest global tech conference that brings together leaders, builders, innovators, and creators from cloud, DevOps, serverless, app development, and software engineering from all around the world.
Also, I built an AI-Powered image processing application that can take images and analyze certain features about the uploaded images…so that was pretty cool 😱
In this blog post and the blog posts to come this week, my hope is to vlog through the entire week and share all that I&#x27;m learning and building with you all so whether you are attending virtually or in person, this AWS re:Invent series on the Tech Stack Playbook will help you gain skills, level up in tech, and boost your software engineering abilities from the sessions I&#x27;m attending throughout the conference.
Here’s a glance at what you’ll learn in this blog post:




It&#x27;s going to be a major week for cloud and tech in general, so I am so excited to bring you along for the ride.
What do you want to know about AWS, serverless, and DevOps? 💭

                    <span>Using Existing Tooling to Make Changes Reversible


This morning I deployed a major change to the production servers of DEV.to. 
Feature update: Feed - DEV Community.


Adjusting the feed is a big deal. It’s the front door of DEV.to.
We wanted to gather information about the impact of changing the front door. At Forem we use the Field Test gem. This allows us to run different experiments. I configured Field Test to assign 20% of the folks to the new strategy and 80% of the folks to the prior strategy.
To insulate from upstream libraries, we often wrap those libraries in our own implementations. This helps with the principle of least exposure; rely on the narrowest interface possible. I wrote the AbExperiment class to be the wrapper around Field Test. With the wrapper, I allowed for the sys…</span>

                    <span>悲观主义哲学家叔本华曾说：

生命是一团欲望，不满足则痛苦，满足则无聊，人生就在痛苦和无聊之间摇摆。

不知他如果穿越到 2021 年，见识了一个被短视频包围，在微博和豆瓣鹅组左右横跳，以第一时间吃瓜的现代社会之后，还会坚持自己的观点吗？
但其实「无聊」一词，有着丰富的内涵。它不是一种无所事事的虚无，而应该是一种有意为之，为「有聊」而蓄力的状态。
说起「有聊」，又是一个被消费主义重新定义（或者说是被创造出来的）的词。何为「有聊」?难道春天去樱花树下、夏天去海边冲浪、秋天去山林里露营、冬天去雪山滑雪，就是所谓的「有聊」吗?
无聊抑或有聊，值得得好好聊聊。
第七期再读播客，我们请到《你有权保持无聊》一文的作者 @Shooca （当然也是 @重新想象Lab 专栏主理人），来一起聊聊关于「无聊」的话题。
「再读」是由少数派数字工具组出品的「读书会式」播客，以少数派发布的文章为线索，以播客的形式对文章中所讨论的话题和内容，进行延展和反思，以拓宽文章所涉及的范围。

作为一个苹果全家桶用户，Apple Music 是我欣赏音乐的不二选择。比起国内的音乐 App 那些「花里胡哨」的社交和直播功能，它干净且纯粹的听歌体验和低廉的价格获得了身边不少朋友的好评。然而，我所使用的 Apple Music 却和别人的有那么点「不一样」：尽管 Apple Music 的曲库已经在不断完善，而我也开了大陆和香港两个地区的订阅，但在我的 iPhone 和 iPad 上，「同步资料库」的按钮却一直是关闭的。
没错，在 2021 年的今天，我依旧坚定着拒绝着音乐订阅制，还在用着 20 年前的方式来听歌：购买 &gt; 下载 &gt; 同步 &gt; 欣赏。所以从某种角度上来看，iPod 这个东西的灵魂一直都存在于我的 iPhone 和 iPad 中，未曾消逝过。

而谈到「音乐订的订阅制」，往往离不开的另一个词语便是「流媒体」。要分清楚的是，我并不拒绝流媒体，因为它本质是一种技术，指的就是服务提供商可以将一系列的媒体文件打包压缩之后放到服务器上，经由互联网实时传输来让用户欣赏内容，而不需要耗费大量的时间在下载这件事情上。简单来说，一切「在线欣赏」的媒体、游戏内容，都归属于流媒体的范畴。我虽然没有开启 iCloud 资料库同步，但我却并不拒绝使用这种技术来欣赏媒体内容。
但音乐订阅制不同，它最核心的一个特点是「租赁」。也就是说，你所拥有的仅仅只是在服务商所规定的生效时段内聆听这首音乐的权利。这些音乐服务商就像你所租房的房东一样，给钱就能留下，不给钱就说再见。只不过一般而言，流媒体音乐服务商们不会因为你拖欠房租而「赶你出门」—— 因为根…</span>

                    <span>点进来的时候是不是以为，我写的肯定不是「把手机时间调早四个小时，给足心理暗示，就算十点起也是一种六点起」这种自欺欺人的方法？
……不好意思啊，还真就是调表这么简单。只不过我是反着调的，而且只调了两个小时。
所以现在每天早上八点闹钟准时把我叫醒，按照正常世界的时间流速，我真的是早上六点起来的。
你到底为什么会有这种奇怪的想法啊
最初当然是因为英国绝望的冬令时制度，十月最后的周日晚上，夏令时结束，时间往后调一小时，回到了格林尼治标准时间（Greenwich Mean Time, GMT）。
这也带来了所有住在高纬度地区人类的共同烦恼：天黑太早，特别致郁。NHS 还专门有一个网页，提供季节性抑郁（Seasonal Affective Disorder, SAD）的相关信息。
现在只是十一月中，然而每天下午四点钟的时候天就黑了，并且还在不断提前中。加上英国特有的阴雨天气，曾经一月有几次三点出门就天黑得不行。没有光明的时间里，无论实际时间如何，常给我一种「到了入睡时间」的感觉，想要做事都提不起精神来。

我刚来英国的时候十六七岁，整个人有用不完的能量，伦敦又是个远超我此前居住地的国际大都市，娱乐和学习上头的时候哪管白天黑夜，加上一个人住没人管我，通宵达旦还能神清气爽，面不改色吃光半桶炸鸡。哪懂什么熬夜胸口痛啊，脱发啊，长痘啊，留学就是好山好水好寂寞啊——「网上的人都在说什么屁话！」1
就是报应来得太快，人生哪有第二个十七岁呢……！
四点多天黑这件事在我的认知里，从「以前开膛手杰克就是在这里杀人的吧，好刺激」「在图书馆里开灯学习，好有氛围」变成了「我不会走路上被人杀了吧」「天黑了学什么习，我要睡觉」。
两年前的某一个下午，上了一天学回家的我走在路灯下，脑子里不断想着长长的 to-do-list，得出的结论是「世界和我快点有一个完蛋吧」。回到家提不起精神学习，想找朋友聊天，却因为时差的缘…</span>

笔者按：本文有视频版本，但视频文案与本文有较多区别。文章对理论的阐述更清晰，视频则宽泛且综合些。若对理论感兴趣，更推荐阅读文章。
 
一直以来，我对于「如何构筑系统」都有着深厚的兴趣，前后也写了一些自己的思考和实践。几个月前，我发表了一篇名为《打造宿舍收纳系统》的文章，尝试从桌搭入手讲述一些建立收纳系统的思路。文章收获了一些好评，不过我始终觉得有的地方还是没说到位，对方法论的描述不够具体，介绍产品太多，谁若想要借鉴，很多信息可能难以复用。
《东西我都装好了｜由极致性价比打造的宿舍收纳系统》
现在，当毕业后回顾曾经的宿舍生活，我终于逐渐参悟埋藏于产品背后的收纳逻辑。所以，这次我想再来聊一聊，到底如何构筑收纳系统。
先解构后建构
「收纳」本质上是解决「人」和「环境」之间的矛盾。任何收纳都是协调的结果，是一种谈判，是在有限空间前提下的排列组合。同时，既然解构是一切建构的前提，那么要「构筑收纳系统」，就要分别理解「人」和「环境」这两大因素。
生活中「人」的需求
早起来不及吃早饭，会觉得饿，于是学会提前一晚准备面包；存放面包需要空间，于是在桌面上随手一丢……这是很常见的做法。这也是最基本的收纳逻辑：「人」产生需求，需求需要产品来满足，而「环境」容纳产品。所以，在讨论如何使桌面井井有条之前，首先要明白自己的生活需求有哪些。
列需求，这项工作有些像产品经理。做产品的一项重要工作是为需求排序，确立优先级。我们也要做同样的事，所以别急着漫无目的地空想，还是采用些理论更成体系——试试大名鼎鼎的「马斯洛需求层次」吧。

                    <span>谢邀。
从业30年，这问题我可能能答108条？
但是最初的，总是最难忘的。那是一切的起点……那时，我还不是漫画家。
回忆001-“画王和他的姐姐”

这幅画来自遥远的1994年，创作时间是1月，还在《雪椰》之前……那年我17。
它诞生的原因，来自我在某小学旁的小书店，发现了《画书大王》的第七期。我被封面的《龙珠》瞬间秒到，很快就买下了它。原本以为这是盗版书商学习香港杂志搞出来的盗版作品合集，但当我翻开它时，竟意外地发现它上面竟刊登着真真切切的国产漫画作品！而且，它它它……居然还接受投稿！！！

彼时一直在找寻能投稿平台的我，恨不得当场就给它跪了！
我扫荡了书店里所有的过期《画王》，回家细读。然后就发现了这个：

“先把这玩意参加咯，然后就投稿！”我这么想着，一分钟也没耽搁，立刻铺开画纸开始设计。
从小就喜欢不按规则行事的我，一口气就画下了“两个画王”。然后振振有词地在设计说明里写了老大一篇：“私以为画王不应只有一人，亦应考虑女性读者需求，所以应为其设计一位姐姐，画王11岁，姐姐14，5，既让女读者也能找到共鸣点，又能照顾年龄稍大之读者的阅读感受……至于为甚给“画王”设计姐姐而不是妹妹，是因为除年纪外尚要考虑角色个性，11岁男童要可爱合适懵懂淘气，小大人乖乖仔会惹人厌恶。而出于性格互补另一角色应温柔知性，此种性格用于姐姐身上合适……且不应互换，知性哥哥和调皮妹妹不讨喜……“
光角色说明，我当年就写了2大页吧……？也不知有没吓着《画王》编辑……
我再找出自己平常的一些习作画稿，塞了至少有个6，7页进信封；（你们懂那种年少时拿着自己上百幅自认的惊世之作恨不得全给塞进去的心情不？哈哈哈……）又另写了一封3页纸阐述自己如何喜爱漫画，吹捧《画王》，并问询如何投稿的心里话……直至把信封塞爆……
换了新信封后，我用透明胶把它给封了两层边，才出街丢进邮筒，怀着对回信的憧憬，屁颠屁颠地蹦回了家。
两周后，我竟然收到了主编大人的亲笔回信！我被告知：”很可惜，你的稿件寄到时，画王设计征集活动早已截至。因此，基于公平原则，你的设计我们不能采纳。“但是：”我们觉得你的画很不错哦！你愿意尝试画个短篇故事投稿试试吗？你需要先……“
那天，我在我的小屋里，抓着回信，高举过头，发出了青春的咆哮！
不喜欢按规则行事的我，开始了《雪椰》的策划……并在回信里给主编说：“对不起……短篇我一时没有头绪，我想了个长篇您要不要看看……？”

咳咳，作为前几天实地蹲点摸排的人员之一，在去在这里涉事人出租屋去搜查违规军服和伪造文件时，我惊呆了！震惊的主要原因是：这么假，怎么能有人信？


在这里，有必要为广大战友正名，我们现役军人是不会拍这么多个人照的（宣传干事们不要打我……），更不会在网上发布带有军种符号标志和军衔的照片。其次，兄dei，你的肩章都要歪到天上去了，“穿了龙袍也不像太子”说的就是这哥们本人了，周身气质着实与军人不符啊！还有营长，是少校配置，这一毛三有点着急啊。

还穿着常服四处剪彩，这行为也属实迷醉。因为警备纠察的范围，只能对人员身份进行核查，并调查清楚军装来源与穿着目的，对违规军装进行没收，并没有执法权，所以涉事人已经被移交给“警察叔叔”立案处理了。后续有结果，小编也会第一时间告诉大家。军人，军装不容抹黑，欢迎大家加入发现“假军人”的打假队伍。
科普一下：根据我国《刑法》第三百七十二条【冒充军人招摇撞骗罪】规定：冒充军人招摇撞骗的，处三年以下有期徒刑、拘役、管制或者剥夺政治权利；情节严重的，处三年以上十年以下有期徒刑。日子挺有判头……

由于比邻的地缘格局和相近的文化传统，东亚各国在饮食习惯上有着很多共性。比如用筷子、喝粮食酒、蘸酱油调味、吃辣椒酱、吃腌渍蔬菜、吃白米饭、吃狗肉……几乎所有被中国人打上了鲜明标签的本民族餐桌元素，都能在朝鲜、韩国、日本、越南找到共鸣。腐乳，也许是唯一的例外。






这种由豆腐腌制发酵而来的小菜，廉价、鲜美、用途广泛。同时，它还完美解决了豆制品不耐存储运输的问题，是中国各地最常见的小菜之一。但神奇的是，同样对豆腐怀有热爱的朝鲜、韩国、日本和越南，却几乎见不到腐乳的影子。不吃腐乳，他们各有理由，诸如“有异味”“高盐”“不健康”，但似乎全然忘记了异味更大的日本纳豆，与含盐量同样高的韩国泡菜。历史上与中国有着千丝万缕联系的冲绳群岛，至今倒是依然流行着一种名为“豆腐糕“的食物。和腐乳一样，它依赖发酵改良豆腐的口感。



因为豆腐糕不能太咸，所以其制作过程只能依靠酒精来控制霉菌的滋生。在加入冲绳本地烈酒“泡盛“后，大量有益菌群被杀死，这就导致豆腐糕的发酵程度不够深，空有腐乳的质感，缺乏氨基酸为腐乳带来的，爆炸般的鲜味。本质上，冲绳豆腐糕只是一种类似腐乳的点心，它远远达不到腐乳的味觉高度。究竟是怎样的土壤，成就了酵变于腐乳之中的中餐滋味、隐藏于腐乳之外的华夏风韵、搭建于腐乳之上的汉唐美学？

制造腐乳的的原材料是豆腐，并且豆腐的含水量不能太高，需要达到一定的固形物密度。日本人发明的“绢豆腐”，是无法制造腐乳的。盐卤，是制作腐乳的先决要素。



虽然这种由氯化钾、氯化镁和溴化镁等杂质构成的制盐废料，具有一定的化学毒性，经常被当成健康饮食的反面教材。但没有朴素的盐卤参与，就无法“点”出干湿适度、软硬合宜的豆腐。纵观众多历史久远的腐乳产地，诸如浙江绍兴、广西桂林、山东临清、云南楚雄、福建莆田……它们有一个共同特点…</span>

《红楼梦》里，有一段耐人寻味的场景。香菱与一群小丫鬟玩，不慎弄脏了身上的“石榴红绫”裙子，小丫头们吓得一哄而散。“妇女之友”贾宝玉留了下来，拿了袭人的同款裙子给香菱。“（香菱）接了裙子，展开一看，果然同自己的一样。又命宝玉背过脸去，自己叉手向内解下来，将这条系上。香菱拉他的手，笑道：‘这又叫做什么？怪道人人说你惯会鬼鬼祟祟使人肉麻的事。’”成年人读到这里，总会露出一脸姨母笑。袭人什么身份？和贾宝玉试过“云雨情”的通房丫头。贾宝玉拿了袭人的裙子给香菱，香菱不但不避嫌，还当着男人的面换裙子。换完了，俩人还手拉手笑嘻嘻说话，嗔怪对方“肉麻”。曹雪芹同志就差把“性暗示”三个字写在纸上了。



石榴裙，是这则故事里的关键道具。事实上，在汉语言文字里，“石榴裙”三字在大多数语境下，都带着浓郁的桃色气息。它暗藏了中国人对性事只可意会不可言传的微妙观念，以及对石榴这种水果既充满向往、又随意亵玩的矛盾态度。作为一个外来物种，石榴也许不是在中国混得最好的水果，但它一定是最能融入汉文化的水果。

根据西晋张华《博物志》记载，石榴是张骞出使西域时，从石国带回来的植物。所谓“石国”，有可能是地处南疆至中亚的古国。今天，当地许多地名里，如喀什（kashgar）、克什米尔（kashmir）、塔什干（tashkent），依然常见许多带有“石”（sh）的音节。虽然石榴是不是张骞带回的植物已经不可考，但它源自西域却是肯定的。公元前十世纪，所罗门王就在肥沃的新月地带，栽种了石榴，并且爱饮用石榴汁榨的香酒。《雅歌》甚至用石榴来形容所罗门王喜爱的姑娘：“你的两颊裹在帕子内，如同一块石榴”。



湮灭了两千年的所罗门王神殿遗址，如今考古学家还在苦苦探索，地面上几乎没有蛛丝马迹可以追寻。但所有人都没想到的是，它跨越山海，来到中国，并在中华文化里，留下了深…</span>

                    <span>傲慢与偏见——谈谈2021年的轻厉和轻小说
既然去年头脑一热写了那个轻厉总结帖，那今年也延续一下习惯写点字，我的能力和眼界也不足以去谈轻小说的趋势、格局这种大东西，更没资格去评价排名是否公正，那就讲讲今年轻厉前10我读过的书，还有进了前100的我觉得还行的和没有进轻厉但我私心偏爱的书吧。毕竟今年前100姑且看过48本，但感觉很多非新作或者新作里觉得只是平平无奇没特别深印象甚至“我为啥花钱买这本”的就不列了，多数书其实只是原先写的感想抄过来改改，部分觉得有必要的可能会写点感想以外的东西。反正想到哪写到哪，聊的也是和标题一样充满了纯主观的傲慢与偏见的内容，大家就当图一乐好了，如果能真的顺着这篇文章发现可能自己会喜欢的书那就太好了。
关于轻厉和协力者本身的介绍和看法在去年帖子就已经说了，所以这里就讲下今年的变化，一是协力者从去年81人扩容到96人（但去年的协力者有不少今年没续投，毕竟30+的社畜还得肝GBF打原神哪有那么多时间读书，所以通过重新招募补充了30-40人左右的新规），而且协力者的选定标准也第一次披露（年间60册或者日常在当轻小说博主管人就有资格评选），反正协力者本身也只是按照自己的喜好投票的读者，投票结果一如既往会公布，直接买本看看大家投啥就行了。二是web票必须投满5部作品，否则视为无效，造成了有效票从去年的10000票下降到了今年的6000票，不过去年本身就有约1/3票是只投了1部作品的，所以相比去年参与者也不算下降，但必须投5票的确可能导致实际上没读那么多就投点凑数的热门书就是了。废话说完，下面开始按照不分文库单行本的总排名随便写写自己看过的那些书了，如果协力者和WEB进前30了会标注下，我自己投了哪些也会标注（排名微博上有）：

飞机是怎么完成复杂的飞行动作的呢？其实这些高超的飞行表演，都和飞机的超机动性有着密切的关系。那什么是飞机的超机动性呢？
简单来说，我们生活当中开车是在二维空间里进行，而飞机是在三维空间里运动。为了进一步弄清楚超机动性，我们要先了解什么是传统的机动飞行。传统机动飞行主要是指以空气动力为升力所形成的过载完成的曲线运动。而超机动性是在空气动力较弱的区间完成的过失速机动动作。
超机动飞行可在三维空间内完成任意角度、方向的机动飞行。这就要求超机动飞行必须在能量足够的情况下才能完成。普通航空发动机提供的推力方向是固定的，而矢量推力发动机可将推力方向做垂直或水平调整，采用矢量推力用于直接推力，完成飞机的各种复杂机动动作，才能实现超机动飞行。详情点击：

                    <span>20世纪90年代初，美国旧金山一家华人超市门口。一位清瘦的古稀老妪在中华小吃店门口停了下来。她的牙齿已经龋坏，医生建议少吃淀粉含量高的食物，但“刘记葱油饼”几个汉字依然牢牢抓住了她的眼睛。虽然油是植物油，不是喷香的猪油；葱也是美国流行的chives（四季葱），不是国内常见的小葱。但葱油二字组合起来，自然而然地表达了故土之思。她说：“味道比不了上海的，但真是解乡愁的雪中送炭”。老妪的名字，叫张爱玲。






在中国960万平方公里的土地上，口味差异、食材差异、烹饪技术差异，呈现出鲜明的地理适性。所谓“中餐”，很少拥有滋味和外观上的共性，更多时候代表的是基于国家认同下的广泛饮食聚落。但葱油也许是个例外：葱属植物和油脂，这两种滋味、形态、质素有巨大差异的食材，只要到了中国人手中，便成为天作之合：无论是下里巴人的葱油饼、葱油酥、葱油拌面，还是文雅内秀的葱油鸡、葱油肉，又或者是入室登堂的葱油海参、葱油鲥鱼，在加持一勺爆香的葱油之后，都成了地道的中国味儿。孤帆远影碧空尽，举国上下爱葱油。

从植物学的分类看，葱与韭菜、大蒜、薤（藠头）都是同一科的近亲。它们天然富含被称为蒜素或葱素的刺激性成分。实质上，无论蒜素还是葱素，都是由丙烯硫醚、丙烯二硫、硫醇等成分，以不同比例构成的硫化合物。嗅觉敏感的人，常常对啃过葱、嚼过蒜的人避之不及，形容对方“嘴里有屎味”。某种程度上说，这也没错，排泄物的气味里，硫化物也做出了相当贡献。出家人不能吃“五荤“，本质上是认为这些刺鼻的气味影响人的清修。



但奇妙的是，惹人嫌恶的葱素、蒜素，在受热并接触油脂后，会发生脱胎换骨的蜕变。脂肪与硫化物快速分解、结合，成为新的风味物质，脂香四溢、葱味缭绕，这是大多数人都难以拒绝的诱惑。口有同嗜，这种高度契合的食材组合，其实在全球范围内广泛存在。日本人以切碎的大葱搭配味噌汤，依靠大豆和鱼肉…</span>

                    <span>『车田漫画里需要的不是起承转合，如何让读者感到惊讶才是最重要的』
———by 车田正美



这是整个车田宇宙的核心，也是圣斗士成为经典的核心。


也许当年就真吃这套，天马行空的设定比故事本身更受关注。车田这么做了，也确确实实的做到了，打造了一个跨世纪的经典。


车田以他自己那套独创的模式开拓了一片新天地。「开头→叙述→转折→结尾」这种死板的形式，在车田宇宙里可不太常见。


各种荒诞无稽的设定，夸张的必杀，独特的战斗表现集合成所谓的『车田節』。凭借这些独特之处，堆砌了圣斗士世界。



▽
当然，光有核没有精美外壳想必也无法做到风靡世界。其中，星座的实体化无疑是圣斗士成为经典的最重要因素。


在生活中，星座早已成为如同十二生肖般的必然存在。当时，多少朋友通过圣斗士把十二星座倒背如流。


星座通过防具【圣衣】得到实体化。再配上美型男与其搭配，这是男女通杀的妙招，无一幸免。


圣衣的定位本身也是一个亮点，它增大了星座实体化的魅力！



『最初打算用日本武士铠甲型防具，战斗模式就像空手道对决那样。威力过于强大，所以需要穿戴防具。


但感觉普通的防具太土。烦恼之际，脑中突然浮现出希腊神话，觉得把防具做成星座的形状那绝对很酷。


防具定位于西洋风那种带曲线的设计。现在看来狮子座艾欧里亚的黄金圣衣，应该是最接近当初所构思的印象吧』



圣衣效仿西洋风甲胄，但未照搬样式。反倒是削弱了笨重感，进行了更贴身的改良，就像穿戴的服装一样。


动画版中的圣衣设计，更是改良得凸显了美型男的完美身体曲线。这样的视觉冲击，也是促进人气暴涨的重要因素吧。
其中，荒木伸吾与姫野美智的功劳甚大


圣衣根据等级还体现着不同的风格。而这种等级差异，车田直接用对身体的覆盖率，进行了体现。



『当初对圣斗士有个大概的年龄设定。青铜为初中，白银为高中，黄金为大学。对应身高约在165，175，180左右。


另外，圣衣的等级如同军队里的官阶。青铜为尉级，白银为校级，黄金则是将级。


一般印象中，低等兵大都穿戴像作业服那种比较短款的服装，长官级是夹克之类的，而将领级则是长款大衣那种吧。


如此，仅凭穿着就可能判断出级别。当时就是这样考虑的』


圣斗士中青铜最低级，看着也最凉快。白银稍微严实点，黄金则露出更少，神圣衣基本就约等于全身覆盖了。



虽然是防具，但圣衣更像是一种时尚。圣衣的命名『cloth』也算是回应了此特征。


似衣非衣，即使不穿戴圣衣，它依靠着星座本来的造型依然能独立炫酷的存在。这样的设计超级有魅力，即便现在也依旧拉风。


▽
如此独特的设定，没有足够大的空间，想必也难以展现出它全部的魅力。


圣斗士宏大的世界观，就为圣衣提供了一个完现魅力的『时尚平台』。圣衣在无形中仿佛拉近了传说与现实的距离。



车田用一个『超』字把众多神话串联起，所有神话被归纳成同宗。各家神话在圣斗士世界里就相当于从宗家衍生出的支派。


但在未普及互联网，信息较闭塞的当时也很难能了解到这部分内容。


而圣斗士的历史背景，其尺度远比当时所理解的要大得多得多，被称之为『大圣战史』。


》宇宙的诞生
》生命的诞生
》雅典娜的诞生
》波塞冬的初次圣战，圣斗士与圣衣诞生
》巨人族之战
》阿瑞斯的圣战
》and so on………


在正篇开始之前，还有这么一大段迷一般的历史存在。这一切在作品中基本都未提及，而是记载于此刊物中。



当了解到这一大段历史后，有种圣斗士的尺度又被放大了一倍的感觉。就是在这样一个大世界里，光芒万丈的圣衣照亮着每个角落。
《圣斗士星矢》中的众神体系是怎么样的？

▽
比起圣斗士的世界观，它的故事则显得要简单得多。但依靠这来自独特灵感的设计，依旧让此作如凤凰烈火般火红。


因为车田一直致力于让观众感受到震撼！


他破天荒的才能，对当时的观众来说也许是恰到好处。仿佛是艾欧洛斯附身，用暗影之箭束缚了世界各地观众的心。


时代在变，那份情怀却难以忘怀。那句口号依旧响彻云霄，被喊出了跨世纪的经典：


燃えろ、俺のコスモよ！

像我的人生是个典型的弯路合集，选错了专业，多花一年本科毕业。从错误的方法减肥，还好年轻没留下毛病。尝试了很多完全不适合自己的造型，幸好都在我做自媒体之前。
说到形象管理我真的想提醒各位妹妹，大学里很自由但也有很多杂音。特别是当你解锁屏幕打开大门，看到的都是大家对某种潮流趋之若鹜的时候，就要多问问自己：这么做是为了自己好，还是为了迎合大众的眼光。

                    <span>答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。
首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。
再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。
其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。
比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。

例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。
举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……
说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。

普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。
当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   
那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？

答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

Hi all,
It has been 3 weeks without an issue and I miss BetterDev myself. We’re planning for some new release of a new version of BetterDev to also contribute useful content on its own instead of just being a link collector :-). So stay tune. BetterDev is here to stay and defintely not giving up on helping our subsribe become a better programmer.

                    <span>Next.js is a React framework that provides a lot of useful features out of the box. One of these powerful features is API routes, which allows you to make an API/backend entirely within your Next.js application.
// pages/api/hello.js
//   requests to /api/hello return {&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Hello, World!&quot;}
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: &#x27;Hello, World&#x27; })
}

Services like Vercel and Netlify manage your API routes in a serverless environment, meaning you get a very scalable API and your code can be deployed globally. 
In this post, we&#x27;ll create an authenticated API route that looks like this:
// pages/api/whoami.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // check if the request contains a valid token
    await requireUser(req, res)

                    <span>I often find myself in the need of a very basic open/close transition in React for components like dialogs, side sheets, or dropdowns. The goto solution for a while seemed to be React Transition Group, which I never understood how to use properly. An excellent solution for animations is react-spring, but I&#x27;d consider it an overkill for a basic CSS powered open/close transition (but it&#x27;s great for animations in something like an image viewer).
This is why I’ve ended up writing my own hook: react-css-transition-hook
It is used like this:
const { isOpen } &#x3D; useMenu();
const [isVisible, props] &#x3D; useTransition(isOpen, {
  entering: &quot;transition ease-out duration-100 transform opacity-0 scale-95&quot;,

                    <span>TLDR


Accuracy tells you how many times the ML model was correct overall. Precision is how good the model is at predicting a specific category. Recall tells you how many times the model was able to detect a specific category.
Introduction
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
How to determine if your model is doing well
When to use precision or recall
Conclusion
Most machine learning (ML) problems fit into 2 groups: classification and regression. The main metrics used to assess performance of classification models are accuracy, precision, and recall.

To demonstrate each of these metrics, we’ll use the following example: We’re a mage on a quest to save the villagers from a horde of monsters. There are 100 monsters attacking the village. We’re going to use machine learning to pr…</span>

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss some patterns for organizing a global state in a React application.
Writing about how to organize global state implies that there is such a thing as disorganized state. Truth be told, there are several issues that can spring up from an unorganized, unprincipled global state.
As a basic example, the global state may contain a response payload from an API request, and it may contain some UI state about whether certain components are visible. These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.
When these distinctions aren&#x27;t made, you can run into trouble. For example, if you create a top-level property for every screen/experience, you can duplicate the storage of the API responses that support those experiences:

                    <span>Google Analytics can provide a lot of insight into traffic and about users visiting your website. A lot of this data is available in nice format in web console, but what if you wanted to build your own diagrams and visualizations, process the data further or just generally work with it programmatically? That&#x27;s where Google Analytics API can help you, and in this article we will look at how you can use it to query and process realtime analytics data with Python.
Before jumping into using some specific Google API, it might be a good idea to first play around with some of them. Using Google&#x27;s API explorer, you can find out which API will be most useful for you, and it will also help you determine which API to enable in Google Cloud console.

                    <span>A product roadmap summarizes how a product strategy leads to the actual implementation and charts out your product&#x27;s vision and direction.
This article will guide you through each step you need to build a roadmap tool using React for your SaaS startup.
📩 Step 1: Installing React
create-react-app.
npx create-react-app roadmap

📝Step 2: Create a roadmap component
We&#x27;ll create a component - Roadmap - that&#x27;ll contain our display and API logic - src/components/Roadmap.
Create respective Roadmap.js, index.js and Roadmap.css files. Add following code in respective order.
import React from &quot;react&quot;;

import &quot;./Roadmap.css&quot;;

function Roadmap() {
  const columnMap &#x3D; [

PostgreSQL v14 was recently released with some major improvements. Some of these improvements include enhancements for heavy workload performance, improved support for distributed workload, and security enhancements.
One of the most exciting releases is enhanced support for JSON, which will be the focus of this blog post.
Before we delve into these improvements, let’s get a good understanding of how JSON has been used in PostgreSQL. This will help us to appreciate the improvements better.
JSON was first introduced in Postgres with its v9.2 release. While it was a very exciting development, its implementation was not perfect. Postgres basically validated that the JSON to be stored is valid JSON and stored it as a text string.
A major improvement came with t…</span>

This workflow builds a Java project, runs all JUnit tests, runs JaCoCo to generate a test coverage report, uses the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action to generate instructions coverage and branches coverage badges from the JaCoCo coverage report, uploads the JaCoCo report as a workflow artifact, and if the workflow run is associated with a PR it then comments on the PR with the computed coverage percentages.
The coverage badges are generated with the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator, which I have been developing and maintaining for a while now. Initially, it was strictly a badge generator, but its functionality has expanded over time to include optional support for PR checks that can be used to fail workflow runs if coverage is below a target threshold or if cover…</span>

                    <span>DynamoDB (DDB) is a compelling datastore choice for Serverless developers for a few key reasons. Dynamo offers a HTTP API, IAM Authorization, serverless pay-per-use billing, and almost unlimited scale when used properly. But there&#x27;s more to DynamoDB than a convenient way to store and fetch data for Lambda users.
If you&#x27;re new to DynamoDB and Serverless, you may not yet have come across DynamoDB Streams yet. Perhaps you have, but are a bit unclear on how to apply them to your applications. Like the OP of this twitter thread, the compelling use cases for DynamoDB Streams may not be clear to you.
Fear not! In this post we&#x27;ll briefly cover what DynamoDB Streams are, and spend most of the post covering specific applications and examples. By the end, you&#x27;ll know how and when to use streams to im…</span>

                    <span>During my time as a developer I&#x27;ve created a lot of &quot;typed&quot; code. One particular issue has come up repeatedly and I finally had a moment of clarity.
Whenever I write something like this ...
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType; // ERROR HERE
  [key: string]: string;
}

... I get the following error on the commented line above.
Property &#x27;config&#x27; of type &#x27;ConfigType&#x27; is not assignable to &#x27;string&#x27; index type &#x27;string&#x27;.
The issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.
I&#x27;ve seen something like the following ...
export interface Person {
  id: number;
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
  [key: string]: string | number;
}

... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.
I came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.
This approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export type DataModel &#x3D; {
  config: ConfigType;
} &amp; {
  [key: string]: string;
};

The following code is another resolution.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType;
  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;
}

This approach has the &quot;issue&quot; that a new &quot;key&quot; could be used with another ConfigType.
As I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.
If anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.</span>

@Noah_Choi：想必各位玩家的 Steam 库中一定会有 Wallpaper Engine 这个强大的动态壁纸工具，它帮无数玩家美化了自己的电脑桌面、营造了一个或炫酷或可爱的娱乐氛围。不过话说回来，动态壁纸可是 Android 平台的强项，所以在近日，Wallpaper Engine 发布了 Android 版本，我们手里的手机或者平板电脑也能享受到创意工坊里无穷无尽的动态壁纸了。
使用 Wallpaper Engine 的 Android 版非常简单，它直接使用了 Android 系统动态壁纸接口，我们可以在壁纸设置中找到 Wallpaper Engine 服务，或者通过应用内设置壁纸。Wallpaper Engine 已经内置了 9 款基础壁纸，可以看作是一个基础功能展示。每种壁纸都会有一些自定义选项，例如修改配色、元素选择等等，在电脑上使用过 Wallpaper Engi…</span>

同福客栈日历 2022
几乎每隔一段时间，我都能听到不同的朋友说又开始重刷《武林外传》了。作为国民下饭神剧，《武林外传》的周边产业也是风生水起、热热闹闹。从原声播客到搞笑博主，应有尽有。同福客栈 2022 日历就是由 @同福客栈知识竞答 推出的。

《同福客栈2022日历》在每一天都精选了一句剧中台词，光看这文字就有画面了，难怪自称「有声日历」。所选取的句子都与当天的日期有所关联，至于到底是什么样的联系，我看必须得是《武林外传》五级学者才能真正发掘出其中的奥妙。

除了台词之外，每页日历底下还有一道知识考验。出题点都是来自剧中不起眼的一点剧情，比如「西铺米街被盗几捆大葱？」，等等…… 我竟然都不知道有西铺米街的存在？！

《同福客栈2022日历》日历页包含阴历阳历、以及星期和节假日，可以说是非常齐全了。全彩插图避开了剧中的人物与场景，不过配色鲜艳丰富，也是来自同福客栈里的各种颜色。

你可以在店铺 同福客栈知识竞答 购买《同福客栈2022日历》售价 98 元。
五金行日历 2022
中断一年后，品牌设计公司 Five Metal Shop 总算是推出《五金行日历 2022》了。

《五金行日历 2022》沿用了一如即往的高级设计。这本日历最与众不同的便是采用了大量鲜艳的配色，来自 10 种全新Pantone 颜色，包含五种霓虹色、两种金属色、两种特殊色和一种粉彩色。

它们有夜市闪烁的霓虹紫、盥洗台上的牙膏粉绿、年节餐桌上的乌鱼子红、每天追着跑的垃圾车黄。受到这些来…</span>

                    <span>前言
不知道你有没有设想过，躺在沙发上就能让卧室的电脑帮你下载想看的电影、说一句话就能让电脑打开想玩的游戏……这些看似「科幻」的操作，在智能家庭逐渐普及的当下，显然已经不是什么难事了。
不过，依赖第三方解决方案往往很难满足自身的所有需求。以我自己为例，我的 PC 作为家用游戏机，一直连接在电视上。想舒服的进行遥控，要么使用无线键鼠，要么使用远程桌面，终归费时费力。无意瞄到桌面摆放的 HomePod，开始思考能不能使用语音去进行遥控。呀，用语音进行控制 Windows 电脑，好像是个很酷的事情耶～
想到就做，但想法是美好的，事实是残酷的。就这样一个简单的需求，局限于设备平台以及系统权限，需要付出大量心血才能实现。愿意折腾的玩家或许会享受这个过程，但作为普通人的我们，就想简单快速的满足自己，那有没有好方案呢？
有的，而且很简单。下面请允许我将这个「魔法」剖析给你，助你成为家里的魔术师🪄
工具介绍

Quicker：Windows 平台上的效率工具，亮点在于用户可以通过可视化编程的方式编写属于自己的动作；
快捷指令：Apple 生态中系统级效率「神器」；

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

过去的我并不认为一个足够安静的写作环境能为自己带来效率的提升——这个想法一直持续到我开始在少数派写作，然后就没有然后了。在少数派发文两个月，我逐渐意识到在写作过程中排除干扰对于保持思考的重要性。所谓「灵感」只不过是个一闪而过的念头，而抓住这个念头的难度并不比在热门视频中精准定位到一条弹幕要更容易一点——视频可以回退和暂停到进度条的任何位置，但人的想法却没有「精确回溯」这一说。既然主观上无法作为，想要更加容易的捕捉灵感，就得从客观条件的方向着手改善：在来自外界的无数干扰中，最容易被消除的当属无休止的环境噪音；而至于那些内在的杂乱想法，就只得「时时勤拂拭，勿使惹尘埃」了。
抱着如此的想法，我开始在市面上寻找一款能够满足长时专注需求的无线消噪耳机。在此之前，我曾经使用过 FreeBuds 3 及 AirPods Pro——前者在佩戴的体验上显得轻松愉快，但消噪功能的作用范围比较有限；后者的消噪效果处于该品类的第一梯队，然其悬挂入耳的设计依然会让我在使用超过三十分钟后明显感觉到耳道的「力不从心」——即使使用最小的硅胶耳塞时也不例外。当下无线消噪耳机的出货主力都是些有一定技术实力的手机厂商，这些优先适配自家硬件设备和软件生态的产品自然也会受到各种各样意想不到的限制和约束 除了 AirPods Pro 不支持 Apple Music 的无损音频，所以我将眼光投向了传统声学厂商推出的同类产品，这其中恰好有一款产品满足了我对于无线消噪耳机的全部期待——Bose QuietComfort Earbuds，通俗一点的名称则是「Bose 大鲨」。

央行解读收款二维码新规
据新华社报道，央行有关人士近日就上月发布的《中国人民银行关于加强支付受理终端及相关业务管理的通知》进行解读，针对「微信、支付宝收款码将不能用于经营收款」的说法做出澄清。该通知的主要内容之一是将条码支付纳入监管范围，对个人收款条码的使用规范做出具体规定，并将于 2022 年 3 月 1 日起施行。
根据央行说法，上述规定的背景是，此前一些商户收款使用「码牌」或者打印封装的二维码，此类「个人静态收款条码」收款安全性较低，容易被犯罪分子利用，因此要求向收款服务机构（如微信、支付宝等）申请转为商用收款码；同时，要求不得通过个人收款条码为具有明显经营活动特征的个人提供经营活动相关收款服务。
至于哪些用户属于「具有明显经营特征」，中国支付清算协会正在研究制定相关标准。人民银行有关人士表示，在相关要求实施之前，支付服务机构必须要全面、充分评估客户正常支付需求，制定配套服务解决方案，确保服务成本不升、服务质量不降。收款服务机构有义务免费为商户提供商用收款码，商户只需要提供必要的身份核实信息。来源
互联网广告新规征求意见，启动播放、视频插播、弹出等广告须确保一键关闭
11 月 26 日，市场监管总局就《互联网广告管理办法（征求意见稿）》向全社会公开征求意见。
根据《意见稿》，互联网广告应当具有可识别性，能够使消费者辨明其为广告。通过互联网媒介，以竞价排名、新闻报道、经验分享、消费测评等形式，或者附加购物链接的其他形式推销商品、服务的，应当显著标明「广告」。以启动播放、视频插播、弹出等形式发布的互联网广告，应当显著标明关闭标志，确保一键关闭。
《意见稿》还禁止了一系列「影响一键关闭广告」的行为，包括没有关闭标志或者需要倒计时结束才能关闭；关闭标志虚假、不可清晰辨识或定位；实现单个广告的关闭，须经两次以上点击；在浏览同一页面过程中，关闭后继续弹出广告；…</span>

如果回到那个时代生活，我宁愿孩子们都不要坐它！因为那个时候的汽车座椅并非现在的「免死金牌」，而是一个不折不扣、骇人听闻的「儿童杀手」。
下面我就用多图来带大家看看，儿童汽车安全座椅有着怎样令人深感震撼的的百年曲折发展史。
❤️ 阶段一：座椅？打包带！
1. 啼笑皆非的早期原型
上世纪30年代能开上车的，那可真不是一般人，人们普遍认为，巨大坚硬、风雨无阻的汽车本身就是最厉害的。
当时的克莱斯勒汽车广告上俨然写着： 
 “亲爱的爸爸，你看我在100公里每小时（60迈/小时）的车上还能写字哎。” 
“是的儿子，我们现在乘坐的就是无坚不摧的钢铁大桥号。”
而且无论大人小孩，一律没有安全保护措施。

这在今天就是典型的反面教材，但那时候人们的交通安全意识基本为零。当时的汽车就算有任何安全设施，也完全不是从乘客的健全和舒适角度出发，而是为了驾驶者的方便。
比如，Bunny Bear公司在1933年发明的第一台儿童汽车座椅，只需要用绑绳捆在座位上。娃坐的高了、看得远了，注意力被转移了。大人开车也就不容易被打扰了。

到了40-60年代，家长可以花1-5刀买一个更加便携轻便的可折叠座椅。
它通常是像下面这样，用铁架子加帆布、麻布、塑料板或木箱做成的。靠两个铁钩子挂在座位靠背上，酷似一个“带钩子的内裤”。

单看乘坐的部分有点像如今的跳跳椅。不过从结构上更像一个吹风机挂篮的放大版。随意程度简直令人怀疑历史。

还有的人为了进一步增加娱乐效果，让孩子站在车座上模仿大人开车。
我们大概不需要通过撞击模拟实验也可以猜出，当意外发生时，这种挂钩座椅…</span>

                    <span>相信绝大多数职场人在平时的工作中，免不了需要参与各种规模、各种性质的会议，有团队内部的、团队之间的、跨职能、向上级汇报工作等等，如何在这些会议中能够游刃有余的有效发言，这是每一个职场人都要学的一门学问，其中很有讲究
这里对会议发言上常见的问题进行一个归类，看是否有遇到过类似经历

想说却不敢说
对 topic 不是很了解，跟不上讨论的节奏，没有办法发言，或者在场的人比较多，有一些资深的或者气场比较强的人存在，此时轮到自己发言时会语无伦次，语言能力急剧下降
敢说却不会说
发言经常被打断，等你阐述完自己的观点后，没有人对你的发言回应直接进入后面的环节或者全场雅雀没有正面或负面的反馈，试图对自己的观点补充几次后，反而自己说的重点没有了
敢说也知道怎么说，犹豫该不该讲
这种经常发生在跟上级汇报工作的场景，有的时候上司会因为缺少一些上下文，问的问题或发表的评论不一定在点子上，此时资历比较浅的人会努力的去迎合、回答解释，而不是当面指出，以此避免正面的冲突，害怕对方下不来台

要解决这些问题，首先需要明确开会的意义，以及在开会时有效发言的意义
根据会议不同的目的，可以将其分为如下 3 类：

日常例会，此类会议的主旨是在团队内同步各项目的进展，目的是找到影响工作进程的阻碍项，通过调整后续策略，以此提高团队整体执行效率
为了做某项决定而开的会，解决一些矛盾的观点，这种会议中会有不同意见直接的碰撞，目的是在会议结束时，能够让与会人都能同意某一种决定做法
征询意见的会议，集思广益来提高负责人实施方案的质量，比如在互联网公司常见的技术评审 review

会议中发言的重要性
常常听到有同学说是为了刷「存在感」，这个可能有一些片面，从侧面也反映出自身在职业发展上还没有找到突破口和契机

首先开会是一个自我学习的途径，在会议中，需要保持自己听懂或者同意会议所做的决定，这会直接影响到自己平时的工作，如…</span>

                    <span>前两天看到了网上流传的清朝的微积分课本中的几页，其中的所有数学表达式都是用中文书写的。虽然整个过程不忍直视，但还是感觉蛮有趣的。于是我打算写篇文章翻译一下这几页。[1][2]
下面我们先来看到第一页：
第一页
请您上眼。乍一看大家肯定觉得：这都啥啊？这样的公式好丑，怎么能记得住呢？而且这里面居然还有完全不认识的字？比如一个双人旁一个天念啥？
下面我就要使用魔法将这些丑丑的公式翻译成能看的懂的形式了。
在翻译之前，我们要明确的一个 大原则 是：在清朝，“分数”的“分子”是分母，“分母”是分子 。也就是说，如果看到“分数”，则我们取它的倒数就可以得到现代意义下的分数 。
提示：这条大原则全文适用 。
首先映入眼帘的是：
 
这明显是一个函数，它翻译成英语就是：
 
啊，看着舒服多啦～这道例题提到了“...求其微分之式，则可依blabla...”。害，无所谓依啥了，我们自己就可以搞定。求  这个函数的微分函数比较容易的。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
与：

做比较可以得到以下破译密码：

双人旁  
一  
长得像垂直符号的符号  
訥  

第一个公式的破译工作就完成啦～很顺利是不是！但是，下一个公式就很难破译了。没错，就是它：

这个公式，堪称我破译工作中最可(**)爱(**)的一个。先不管天啊，地啊啥的。从刚才的破译密码中我们得知的信息是 双人旁  ，于是问题就出现了这里面有  ，  以及  。咦？这么快就跳到全微分啦？但仔细不看不对啊，这跟全微分完全不沾边啊。于是我推测，这不是全微分，而是刚才例题的推广，因为我在下面的结果中看到了天的地次方：  ：

此处的天和地不能再理解为  和  了，而是应该理解为  与  ，说白了，就是对函数：
 
求导（ 这个表达简直了。。。哈哈哈哈哈哈哈）。
像破译第一个公式一样，这里我们如法炮制即可。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
将式  进一步化简可得：
 
现在我们将  除到左边之后与之前所提到的 大原则 一起可得：
 
将式  与：

做比较可得：

戍  
天/地  

这样第一页我们就完全破译啦！下面开始第二页的破译～
第二页
这一页的破译工作会异常轻松。首先我们看到了“积分”这个字眼，并且他说“啥啥（就是那个怪怪的公式），要必为简式”才可求其积分。所以我们不妨先来看看：

这是个啥？
由之前所总结的破译密码可知，天一定代表一个“变量”。而且我们还知道长得像垂直符号的那个符号等价于加法，因此我们推测：

长得像转置符号的那个符号  

而甲，乙，丙...啥的自然表示的就是常数  等等。至于寅卯午巳这些字，如果你愿意，可以定义为  等等，它们也都表示常数。因此，我们可以将其破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
同理，我们可以将：

破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
聪明的你一定发现了：

表达的就是不定积分的分部积分法：
 
破译密码为：

禾  
戌/亥  

最后是第三页：
第三页
有了之前两页的经验，相信这一页大家一定得心应手啦。在这一页中，所有的汉字数字与阿拉伯数字的含义是一致的。而天，地，人（这应该是人吧）表示的都是变量。因此我们可以设：
 
因此：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
而：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
显然，式  是式  的一个原函数。而丙上面加一个点表示的是积分常数  ，与普通的丙表示的  是不一样的（二丙，看起来像麻将）。
现在让我们看到最右边的：

这表示的显然是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
我一度认为左边是二阶导数。。。后来一想不对，如果是二阶导数的话“分母”上的二应该在双人旁后面。因此：

表示的是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
然后后面说可以将  ，进而：

表示的就是（注意 大原则 ）：

                    <span>It&#x27;s in the name, duh. But, what does it actually mean? In a nutshell, you code everyday for at least an hour and document everything that you learnt. It&#x27;s from the 100DaysOfCode website.
Well, I&#x27;m new to to the Web Development world and have yet to learn many things. So, this is to make up somewhat for that gap in knowledge.
As the rules suggest, I&#x27;ll code for at least one hour everyday and share my status on social media. This will also act as a timeline blog of my journey as a Web Developer.

在北京待了差不多半年，本想写北京，但其实细想，我似乎很难在北京找到一种放松的感觉。胡同的静是属于游客和大爷的，很难属于在这个城市工作的外来者。咖啡吧和下午茶是精致的悠闲，按摩不了紧绷的神经，长居城市的我们，偶尔也需要离开社交层面的部分自我，与自然进行一次近距离对话。
此外，漫步北京也许是容易的，漫步国庆却不是那么简单。于是我和朋友们选择在国庆「出逃」北京，途沿火山和草原，一路向西，到鄂尔多斯的沙漠折返，经过呼和浩特和山西大同，最终回到北京，在北京的西边画一个圈。
在北京的西边画一个圈
前期准备：自驾+住宿
越往城市边缘走，路上的风景就越多样，相比其他出行方式，自驾也许最合适来「走西口」
对比了各类租车软件后，我们最终选定在「神舟租车」上租一辆「宝沃BX5」。国庆五天的价格大概在 2640 元，平分到我们 4 个人大概是 660 元/人。这是国庆的价格，我看了一下大概在平常日价格的 3 倍以上，如果多人一起在平常日子里出游那真是很香了。
自驾过程中总共加了 2 次油，总价算到个人大概是 100+。这里要提醒大家的是，最后还车的时候记得一定要去加油站加满油，不然平台会扣除格外 100 元加油服务费。

住房上，我们有三晚住的是平常的旅店，另外一晚住的是蒙古包，都是两个人一间。出乎意料，最后每个人每天在住宿上花的价格大概在 100 元左右。下面是住宿的支出合计：

10.2 北京-草原天路-乌兰察布
10 点出发-下午经草原天路（桦皮林东入口-野狐岭出口）往乌兰察布-十点到达白影察干镇

革命不是请客吃饭、不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致、那样从容不迫。
但并不是所有的沃尔夫斯堡人都有这样的觉悟，他们抗拒这样的现实，所以坚定的改革派、大众集团 CEO Herbert Diess 又一次处在漩涡中心。
根据路透社消息，大众工会主席 Daniela Cavallo、大股东皮耶希、保时捷家族的代表，会在周二举办的监事会执行委员会议上讨论 Diess 的去留问题，并在 12 月 9 日前做出最后决定。这场危机距离 Diess 获得工作合同延长，雄心勃勃地发布 2030「NEW AUTO」战略，赢得改革的阶段性胜利仅仅过了 4 个月。

对于大众这种级别的巨人，大变革下的转身必然阵痛，注定不会平静。
百年未有之变局
2021 年是智能电动车继续狂飙突进的一年。国内市场新能源渗透在 9 月历史性地突破了 20%，而距离上一次突破新能源渗透率的历史性门槛「10%」，仅仅相差 5 个月。站在这波历史性的风口上，国内造车新势力三强「蔚小理」先后突破十万辆大关，0 到 1 的蜕变已经完成，并开始把触手伸向大众的欧洲大本营。

特斯拉一骑绝尘，上海工厂产能拉满，将弹药源源不断地输送到中国和欧洲市场，万亿美元的市值高过丰田、大众、通用等十余家传统车企之和。掌舵着财大气粗的大众集团，Diess 也不禁感叹，「特斯拉因为其高估值，可以无限地获得资金和资源。」
当然，大众已经是传统车企中转型电动化最积极的那一个，纯电品台 MEB 的 ID. 家族产品已经打向中欧美三大市场。Diess 可以在内部讲话中安抚大众员工，在中国，他们的电动产品第三季度销量比…</span>

                    <span>大家好，万维猫的老王又来啦。嗯，到这集为止，年番的第一个小副本结束了，也按照之前约定的，和大家聊聊这次年番剧本创作的一些想法。
矿场篇的五集在年番中属于比较短的段落篇幅，优点是铺垫不用很长，该收的线很容易收回来，节奏也会比较紧凑。从燕家堡特别篇开始全面接手导演和编剧工作以来，我就在思考和试验，真人风格的动画表现形式，对于节奏的要求显然比电视剧要快，但又不能一味的快，人物刻画和情绪渲染也很重要。所以我们会在年番中更注重人物的复杂性。比如这一集里给陈师姐加的这种欲言又止的情感，还有之前给宣乐赋予的理想主义瞬间，其实又何尝不是给韩立增加了一些情绪的锚点。
很多人物，如果你不看他，他可能就是个路人，但略微驻足，就能看到他们身上的种种线索思绪。正如出现在我们生命里的每个看似不经意的相遇，都会给我们带来无限的可能。所谓一期一会，见众生如见己，就是如此。
凡人的整体基调不能说是欢快的，终其一生，韩立都是过客，不是归人。他所探寻的，既是未知的尽头，也是存在的意义。当然，过程中的升级舔包这些喜闻乐见之事也可成为短暂的快乐源泉，但此行漫漫不知所终的未知与伤情，还有那些必将来到却无法改变的离别，才是韩立日复一日需要面对的大道无情，这与我们的一生又何其相似。
也许这就是为何很多纪元以后，身在仙界的韩天尊，还会偶然想起那个在天南山间乘舟凌水而行的黄昏，还有那盛开在漫山遍野的白色野菊花。

Adding SASS / SCSS support
Setting up Eslint and Prettier
Setting up Eslint to run automatically before every commit (via a Git hook)
Setting up Semantic Commits (via a Git hook)
Any of the above items are optional and can be skipped during the process. For example, if you are not familiar with Semantic Commits or do not plan to use it, you can skip that part and move on to another.

                    <span>It’s a tale as old as time, as a software engineer, you write some code, you’re happy with it and then you deliver it. End of story, right? No more work to be done! As usual there’s many more layers to deal with and one of those many layers is maintenance……boooooo!!!!!
I know this isn’t the most amazing topic to write about, but it solves a real-world problem for me and I’m hoping for some of you too.
I’m a backend engineer and write a lot of C#, which means I end up with solutions relying on NuGet packages. These do need to be updated all the time because there are other engineers out there doing amazing work keeping their packages up to date and I like to keep my dependencies up to date. This is where I find myself, with the problem of having to create a branch, update the packages, comm…</span>

                    <span>Today, I had time to do some coding 🧑🏼‍💻 😀
I started my Saturday early, with a 6am presentation (my time) to one of our Twitter Developer Communities, in India. It was a fun run through of what’s available in the brand new version of the Twitter API, with a live demo using our Postman Collection 💻 I also took some really great questions from the folks in the live stream, so I appreciated the opportunity.
@andypiper

      
After that (and, several cups of ☕), I thought I’d have a play with something that caught my eye a couple of weeks ago - the new Glitch in Bio starter template from the great folks over at Glitch. I&#x27;d seen the news about it, and the follow-up post about the generated sites being Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and I had been keen to have a play for a few days... but Re…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s hard to maintain a state. Harder to maintain a UI. And near impossible to keep a user happy.
No matter how well you plan, disintegration always happens.
React is a well-known web UI library with a long history of state implementation. Components shape the application. But it&#x27;s a state&#x27;s job to keep it inside the sanity borders.
That is unless it drives the developer insane before achieving this goal!
We know how the seasons pass. In spring, flowers bloom. In summer, sweats run down the armpits. With autumn, leaves leave the branches. And who will forget the snowy days of winter? (Hint: People who live after global warming makes its debut!)

                    <span>Polar charts often look impressive, which makes some people think that creating them is a tricky process demanding plenty of skills and expertise. Well, I am going to debunk this myth right now! Let me show you how to easily visualize data in a beautiful interactive JavaScript Polar Chart.
Fundamentally, a polar chart is a variation of a circular graph drawn with polar coordinates. It can also work well to visualize some sorts of categorical data for comparisons, which is exactly the case I want to demonstrate now. In this tutorial, I will build a column polar chart, with the bars growing from the center of the diagram to represent values with their length.

Technically I&#x27;ll count this as a Sed episode.
Sed is a very simple limited-purpose programming language which supports regular expressions and some really few other things. A sed script, usually a shell one-liner, is run separately on every line of input. It&#x27;s still used in many shell scripts where one command produces some text, then sed reshuffles it a bit with regular expressions, then another command consumes it.
I don&#x27;t really approve of this style of programming, and I think you&#x27;re better off using proper script in Ruby, Python, or Perl pretty much every single scenario - it will be much clearer, actually testable, and very often more concise as w…</span>

                    <span>Javascript always has some surprises in store. for example, typeof [] return object and not array. This has historical reasons. But this can be very confusing
How can you then properly check if something is an array?
For example, you could check if the constructor is an array.
([]).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
(new Array).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
({}).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(true).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(null).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError
(undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError

As you can see this has a problem. With null and undefined a TypeError is thrown. 
You could catch this for example with a try/catch.
try {
  (undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
} catch(e) {
}

But you don&#x27;t want that.

                    <span>If the C: drive is running out of space, we can move our WSL2 file system to another drive in a few steps.
If we are using an user different than root, we need to know it, running the whoami command (WSL side):

Also we need to know the distro name and WSL version, running the wsl --list --verbose command on PowerShell (Windows Side):

Knowing the username: equiman, the linux distribution: Ubuntu, and confirm that we are using the WSL 2 version, we are ready to...

All next steep need to be done on PowerShell (Windows Side).
First we need to shutdown WSL to avoid data corruption. Close all WSL terminals that are using it and then run the wsl --shutdown command.
Next we are going to create a backup from our Ubuntu linux distribution.
mkdir D:\backup
wsl --export Ubuntu D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

Don&#x27;t worry if you not see progress indicators. This can be take a while depending how much data you have. Maybe it&#x27;s good idea take a rest.

When finish, we need to to unregister the linux distribution from C: drive. It will also release the disk space.
wsl --unregister Ubuntu

And then, import again on our new disk. I&#x27;ll use D: disk as an example.
mkdir D:\WSL
wsl --import Ubuntu D:\WSL\ D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

By default Ubuntu will use root as default user, to switch to our user (equiman in my case) we need to run this commands.
cd $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
ubuntu config --default-user equiman

Ensure replacing equiman with yours.
Restart WSL running wsl command and it&#x27;s done.
That’s All Folks!

                    <span>今年称得上是「游戏小年」，这点想必喜欢玩游戏的读者们都有同感；从去年同期到现在，整个业界尚未拿出一款投入高质量强，既叫好又叫座的高水平作品。那几款玩家们盼望已久的超级大作，发售后却接连遭遇口碑上的滑铁卢；而更多让人翘首以待的作品，全都抢着把发售档期排到了 2022 年。
不过，虽然超大型制作没能带来亮眼表现，但今年值得一玩的作品并不少。它们要么内容扎实，可以支撑你玩上很长一段时间；要么有着独特的创意和新奇的玩法，能让你体验到特别的乐趣。
每年的这个时候，都是游戏厂商们疯狂打折促销的日子，各个平台也会推出主题促销活动；有意思的是，今年 Steam 的秋季特卖还比之前延长了 1 天，12 月 1 日才会结束。
这次我们也为大家整理了一些值得入手的史低游戏，不妨趁着「黑五」特惠，用便宜的价格买下几款心仪的作品；在为今年划上圆满句号的同时，也能用一颗充满期待的心去迎接未来。
注意：不同平台的折扣截止日期不一致，具体详情请以对应平台的商店页面信息为准。
双人成行

想必这会是很多人心中的年度最佳作品之一，它拥有充满天马行空般想象力的关卡设计，以及令人眼花缭乱的各式玩法；而无论小游戏还是 Boss 战，它也充分利用了二人协作的机制，没有将这一卖点流于纸面。
本作在 Steam、Xbox 和 PS 平台上皆有折扣，支持本地双人同屏或者联网游戏。值得一提的是，第二个玩家通过「好友通行证」即可和你一同畅玩，不需要买两份。
此外，你也可以通过办理 EA Play 玩到本作。

前言
如今市面上笔记类或者知识管理类软件太多，甚至每个月都能看见一款新产品的上线。工具本身并没有优劣，它们只是反映了工具使用者的需求和工作流。虽然不应该舍本逐末般沉迷于工具本身的研究，但依然不妨碍我们去探索和寻找新的工具来完善自己的信息管理。
今年年初的时候，我偶然间知道了 Anytype 这款知识管理软件，瞬间被它的「本地化 Notion」的用户评价所吸引，于是立即填写 表格，加入 Anytype 的测试计划。
Anytype 目前可以填写申请表格，每个月大概40-50人
六月份的时候，我收到了测试邀请（onboarding program），但是由于时差的缘故没法参加在线介绍。当我在十一月收到新的测试邀请时，没有丝毫地犹豫就加入了。
来自 Anytype 工程师的邀请邮件
在产品说明会议里，CEO Zhanna Sharipova 简单介绍了 Anytype 的发展路径、当前主要功能以及未来愿景，工程师 Enda Crowley 实时展示了一些基本操作。

会议结束之后，Enda 立即发送了 Anytype 的下载和对应社区邀请链接。有趣的是，本周Anytype 又推出了 iOS 测试版本。截至 2021 年 11 月，Anytype 目前支持桌面端有 MacOS、Windows 以及 Linux，移动平台有 Android 以及 iOS。

                    <span>One way is using function parameter and another way is using extension function.
There could be more than 2 ways to implement binding adapters, but this is what I know. Let&#x27;s look at what binding adapters are first.
Binding adapter is used for implementing custom attribute in your layout file. For example, instead of using the defaultandroid:text attribute, you want to customize it by creating a new attribute app:customText.

app:customText

                    <span>Introduction


Software engineering is a field that is regularly changing. Thus, developers must be continual learners to stay sharp.
However, motivating yourself to learn and creating a lasting habit can be difficult, especially if you&#x27;re self-studying outside of school or work.  Below are four techniques that I use to stay motivated while learning.
Set deadlines
Gamify
Spice it up
Identify the end goal
Learning without structure can feel like an endless task with no end in sight; it&#x27;s often nice to have a sense of progress. I&#x27;ve found that artificial deadlines give me something to work toward and cleanly mark progress.
Here are some examples of deadlines you could set for yourself:
I will study Python for 30 minutes by the end of the day
I will complete one module of my online JavaScript…</span>

                    <span>We all want to see a return on our investment, especially when creating applications, which require significant resources.
You spent money, your time, put in a lot of effort, and finally, your app is ready. Now comes the new challenge: what to charge for your app?
The decision depends on many factors. The number of working hours, testing costs, marketing and promotion, purchase of any licenses are some aspects that define the overall cost of development. Calculate the costs first, then set the price for the app.
To put an adequate price tag on your product, first, let&#x27;s look at the different pricing models.
Understanding the pros and cons of pricing models will help you choose the best option for you.
It is essential to find the balance between the price that customers are ready to pay and…</span>

                    <span>Context


Our company has organized &quot;Secret Santa&quot;, pre-covid times. I got the name of a nerdy colleague and a friend. I decided to gift him Amazon gift coupon. Like people usually do - hiding gift somewhere in desk, I instead created an online puzzle like a treasure hunt using some automation. If he solves he will receive gift on his email.
Printed a bar code on a paper and put it on my friend&#x27;s workstation desk. Upon scanning, it redirects to a simple website I&#x27;ve created using wixsite.com.
Here&#x27;s the picture of printed barcode along with other gifts -


The landing page shows following instruction -
 
To get your gift all you need is an email address.
Before I tell you more, why don&#x27;t you give a try yourself to find the email address? Here&#x27;s the link after scanning barcode - https://turantsephele.wixsite.com/giftgenerator

Once you click &quot;Get email address&quot;, it redirects you to another page which shows a timer and nothing else. And with a small hidden button somewhere in page.
If you are able to find the button and click, it redirects you to brainfuck visualizer with some pre-populated code. 
I&#x27;ve written this code in brainfuck and when you run it outputs next hint.
That brainfuck code outputs a simple string -
Decode:747572616e7473657068656c6540676d61696c2e636f6d

After decoding, it gives you the email address.
I have created a IFTTT flow which triggers when there is an incoming email with subject &quot;HOG RIEEDERRRRR&quot; and it is from my friend&#x27;s email address.
Once this condition matches, IFTTT sends an email back with gift coupon details.
Once timer ran out it reveals a link to brainfuck visualizer code.
If he can&#x27;t solve the puzzle in 3 days, an email triggers and sent gift coupon details to friend&#x27;s email address. Again using IFTTT.
That&#x27;s all folks!

                    <span>Many modern web platforms leverage on maps and location-based features to provide services to users. Some popular examples of this are Uber and Airbnb. 
With the  TomTom Maps SDK , including a map in your website has never been easier. The toolkit enables access to various mapping features including street maps, real-time traffic conditions, fuzzy search and route planning for travellers.
As a developer, you can leverage on TomTom&#x27;s APIs methods to build and customize maps in your web or mobile application.
Let&#x27;s walkthrough the process of adding a map to your website using the TomTom Maps SDK. In the end, I&#x27;ll include a link to the source code for this project for reference.

After creating an account at npmjs.com I used the command npm login from the terminal to link my npm account.
I changed the version in package.json to 1.0.0 and also added a tag to my latest commit with:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &quot;1.0.0 Release&quot;

I then published my project using the command npm publish. 
After I made some changes to the repo, I decided to unpublish the package and start from the beginning. I decided to rebrand the project from &quot;dodo-ssg&quot; to &quot;static-dodo&quot; and publish it with the new name.
Gus McCallum tested the program on his computer by installing it with:
npm install -g static-dodo

It was interesting to see how a new user approaches getting and learning how to use the tool. Gus ran th…</span>

                    <span>Overview


Linear Regression is the first algorithm in the Demystifying Machine Learning series and in this article we&#x27;ll be discussing Linear Regression using Normal equation. This article covers what is Linear Regression, how it works, the maths behind the normal equation method, fixing some edge cases, handling overfitting and code implementation.
Linear Regression in simple terms is fitting the best possible linear hypothesis (a line or a hyperplane) on the data having a linear relationship so that we can predict the new unknown data point with the least possible error. It&#x27;s not necessary to have a linear relationship in data but having such can lead to approximately close predictions. For a reference take a look at the below representation.

Eleven weeks ago when I started in Open Source Development 600 at Seneca I never thought I would get to the point of actually releasing something into the wild. Over the term we have been working on our individual static site generators. The purpose of these tools is to take a text file or Markdown file and parse it into a valid HTML document. 
It can include a variety of features depending on the student, but some of the options for my own textToHTML include stylesheets, using a config file instead of the command line, and having an output option to specify a folder to put the HTML documents into.
Throughout the weeks, we have been contributing to Open Source projects on GitHub and making pull requests. Included in this is the idea of contributing to each other&#x27;s SSG&#x27;s. Coll…</span>

The main reason for this is because I have a certain development methodology that either produces less bugs, catches them at a unit test level, or makes tracking them down much easier.
Here are my tips...
1. Write your own COS cheat-sheet.
This is mainly for anyone that is new to COS. One of the biggest bug hazards is not knowing how certain commands and functions work. Take the time to play with a language and try out all of its variances. The process of then documenting your own cheat-sheet will cement the knowledge and provide a quick reference review tool. Not only will you become more productive, but you will certainly write less of those a…</span>

I have found that having a tangible end goal increases my odds of project completion by nearly 100%. In this case, the goal is to create a command line program that simply POSTs requests to my personal notes application engram.
This is not just a learning or for fun project as I recently realized that the command line is a great place for the input of quick notes. When I’m working, I sometimes find myself investigating something in the terminal and realize that I have a thought that I’d …</span>

本周话题：美国宪法拍卖，一个区块链案例
上周四（11月18日），美国纽约有一场拍卖会，拍卖第一版印刷的美国宪法。这件事很有意思，因为它跟区块链有关。
两百多年前，美国打赢了独立战争，13个殖民地的代表聚在一起开会，起草了宪法，决定建国。

宪法通过后，一共印刷了500份，让代表们带回各州。留存到现在的有13份，其中只有一份在私人手里，这次拍卖的就是它。


一个区块链爱好者看到了这件事。晚上在群里聊天，他随口提了一句，有人就说：&quot;我们集资去参加吧！&quot;
大伙一听，觉得很好玩，通过区块链，向全世界的网友集资，去竞标一件古董。以前没人这么干过，就让我们试试看，证明技术有这个潜力。
说干就干，他们就在区块链上成立了一个组织，叫做&quot;宪法 DAO&quot;（ConstitutionDAO），专门负责这件事，相当于项目公司。
他们注册了域名 ConstitutionDAO.com，整个网站只有一个页面（下图），解释了整件事情。

下面就是最关键的部分了，怎么才能收到钱呢？
令人意想不到的是，这反而是最容易的部分。专门的区块链工具，都已经开发出来了，在互联网上公开提供服务，可以直接拿来用。
集资服务叫做 Juicebox（下图）。它将每个项目的合约，写入区块链，并提供一个钱包接收资金。所有提供资金的人，会收到项目的代币，作为出资证明，享受相应的权益。

有了集资账户还不够，还必须让大家相信，项目组织者不会卷款跑路。大伙转账以后，组织者将这些钱转到他的个人钱包，那可…</span>

笼子和翅膀，你更喜欢哪一个？

@潘誉晗：电影以音乐剧作曲家乔纳森·拉森的故事为蓝本，讲述了 1990 年为了梦想而不断奋斗的乔。即使工作不是一帆风顺，即使走商业路线可以给他带来更好的生活，可他始终没有放弃，只因那不是他心里真的想要呈现给观众的故事。
我相信，即使观众对于乔纳森·拉森没有特别了解，可是当听到开场的旁白「在获得托尼奖之前，在获得普利策戏剧奖之前，在《吉屋出租》这出剧的票被卖完之前，我们就已经失去乔了」时，心里还是会突然感到一阵刺痛。
首次在电影中自弹自唱的加菲表现得棒极了，他身上的那股少年气让他在 38 岁的年纪饰演 29 岁的乔也足以让人信服，还有天…</span>

这些 App 值得买
Affnity
今年，Affinity 提供了全场 7 折优惠活动，这里包括桌面应用、插件、工作手册等内容，另外针对 iPad 应用提供更为给力的 5 折优惠！对于从事图形设计、排版的用户来说，由于 Affinity 的创意设计应用均采用了一次买断制，也许是比 Adobe 更为实惠的选择。

台式机应用
支持 Windows 以及 macOS，三款套件 Affinity Photo、Affinity Designer、Affinity Publisher 分别对标 Adobe Photoshop、Adobe illustrator、Adobe InDesign，涵盖图像处理、矢量图设计以及桌面排版，但 Affinity 系列整体上要比 Adobe 套件轻量得多。

Affinity Designer（ ¥348 → ￥248）

iPadOS 版 Affnity 应用
iPadOS 版的 Affinity Photo 和 Affinity Designer 拥有与台式机版同样强大的功能，其便携性非常适合将 iPad 带出去完成工作。

2021.11.26 尽量每周五更新
《瞎玩菌的游戏周报》是我对游戏领域的观察和点评。具有以下特点：

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

享乐
「享乐（yuè ）」版块是为了推荐好的游戏音乐，「享」字体现「分享」音乐和「享受」音乐两重意思。我衷心希望也许有人因为音乐从而对游戏产生兴趣（我就是）。也欢迎读者评论推荐你们喜欢的游戏音乐，我将会在后续的游戏周报中分享。
《Unlocked Memories》 - Berlinist

这是来自游戏《笼中窥梦(Moncage)》的原声音乐。你可以在 Bandcamp | Spotify | YouTube Music | QQ 音乐 | 网易云音乐 | Steam 收听整张专辑（共 9 首曲目），或者按名称在你喜欢的音乐服务中搜索。
要闻
「要闻」版块为你带来游戏领域最重要的话题性事件，除了展示足够丰富的细节，还有我的主观点评、吐槽或提问。游戏本身就是一种互动娱乐，我非常鼓励读者通过评论互动的方式，参与到话题中来，而不是仅仅当个「读」者。

作为 2019 年才入坑 F1 的萌新车迷，我想借本文分享一下自己的入坑经历和路径推荐。如果有小伙伴因为近期大热的中国车手周冠宇而对 F1 产生了一点兴趣，可以通过这篇文章更快地进入 F1 的世界。我也会在文中简单介绍一下目前的 F1 格局和规则，老车友亦可温故知新。
引言
随着周冠宇加入 F1 阿尔法罗密欧车队的消息正式公布，史上第一位来自中国大陆的正式车手将要征战下赛季 F1 的新闻一夜刷屏。在关于中国车手的讨论中，有人为华人在赛车领域的成就而喝彩，也有部分网友质疑他是花钱「买」位置、「带资进组」等，引发了一些争议。
那么，对于一个不了解 F1 比赛的人来说，这个坑到底值不值得入呢？
我们还是先了解一下，F1 到底是啥比赛，以及好看在哪儿。
F1 是什么？看点在哪里？
很多小伙伴一听到 F1，基本第一反应就是舒马赫和法拉利，毕竟这是 F1 几十年历史中最为成功的车手和车队。但除此之外，大部分非爱好者就了解不多了，可能只会偶尔在体育新闻里零星听到过奔驰车队夺得几连冠、刘易斯汉密尔顿拿到个人第 100 个大奖赛冠军之类的新闻。
F1 是什么比赛
F1 全称为 Formula One，中文名叫一级方程式赛车，是一个由 国际汽车联盟 举办的最高等级的 赛车 比赛。名称中「方程式」是指一组所有参赛车辆都必须遵守的规则。F1 一年为一个赛季，包括一系列二十多场大奖赛（Grand Prix），每场比赛的结果算入积分系统并以此确定两个年度世界冠军：一个颁予车手，一个颁予车队1。
F1 被很多人认为是赛车界最重要的赛事，同时也是最昂贵的体育运动…</span>

OPPO 新品发布会

OPPO 于 11 月 25 日正式发布全面升级的人像视频手机 OPPO Reno7 系列手机，新机前置猫眼镜头采用了和索尼一同研发的全新 RGBW 传感器——IMX709，从根本上提升感光能力，传感器逻辑层上内置 OPPO 自研硬件级 IP 即 RGBW 图像处理单元，同时采用DTI像素隔离技术，显著减少了像素之间的信号串扰，从而有效提升信噪比，避免偏色、伪色等现象，这使得该机目前成为了前置摄像头感光能力最强的手机，相对 Reno6 感光能力提升 60%，同时画面噪点降低 35%。且得益于硬件级 DOL-HDR 功能支持，IMX709 具备更强的动态范围能力，在暗光、逆光环境下对人像细节的捕捉和呈现比传统 RGGB 传感器也更具优势。

后置镜头部分则搭载 OPPO 与索尼联合开发的 IMX766 旗舰级主摄，带来更丰富的拍摄玩法，人像模式 2.0 能够实现接近单反的人像虚化和光斑效果，开启 AI 场景增强后能根据暗光、逆光等复杂环境下，自动调用月光夜景算法与 Live-HDR 算法，深度还原人脸肤色与背景。

工艺上首次将航天级光刻工艺应用于手机后盖，通过激光显影技术在晶钻工艺基础上二次光刻，形成 120 万道细密光栅纹理，让玻璃后壳具备流星雨般的视觉观感和立体触感。在机身正面，Reno7 系列采用行业领先的极窄边框工艺，将屏占比提升至 92.8%，镜头模组上引入光纤热弯工艺，将 1mm 直径的光纤环绕主摄系统一周形成呼吸灯效果，并采用陶瓷彩镀镜圈，实现光哑一体设计，将主摄镜头的防刮耐磨性能提升至普通金属的 10 倍。

硬件配置上，Reno7 Pro 和 Reno7 分别搭载天玑 1200-MAX 和骁龙 778G；前者为游戏玩家带来了 90 FPS 极限稳帧、超级闪电启动 2.0 和全场景网络优化，内置 4500 mAh …</span>

                    <span>写在开头的话
其实早在情报贴放出来的时候，讨论群里面关于人吃人的话题早已吵翻天了，但是直到看到完整的漫画正文，笔者收获到的却是一份更为沉重的感悟，米二真正想告诉读者的并不是吃人肉这种猎奇向的噱头，而是探讨长生不老之人如何做到对”初心“的坚守。

初心，也就是笔者之前在其他分析文中提到过的”道“。如果有兴趣的读者可以回去看下笔者关于”道“的分析。在此就不多做赘述了，开始本期的分析。
如何看待无根生的“道”
一、长生不老的诱惑
在中西方各个文明圈中，“长生不老”都是一个永恒且共通的话题。古今中外都有无数的人为之疯狂，希望去寻找答案。古人寻找修仙之法、寻找灵丹妙药；现代的科学家探索细胞分裂，研究人类的基因，也寄希望于能够找到永生的答案。
东方求长生
自古就有所谓当了皇帝想成仙，我真的还想再活五百年之类的愿望。
《太上纯阳真经·了三得一经》：“天一生水，人同自然，肾为北极之枢，精食万化，滋养百骸，赖以永年而长生不老。”
从秦始皇派徐福出海寻找蓬莱、瀛洲诸仙山上的仙人，欲求长生不老药为开端。而其后二千多年的帝王们，在追求长生不老药这件事上献出生命者络绎不绝。
汉武帝刘彻在追求长生不死的帝王队伍中也是“出类拔萃”的一位，甚至比秦始皇嬴政还疯狂。汉武帝追求长生不死在《史记·武帝本纪》中有很多篇幅。几乎一半的篇幅都在讲汉武帝终其一生如何宠信方士，如何劳师动众追求仙药。[1]
唐太宗，这又是一位千古一帝，历史上有名的明君，但也一心追求长生不老。唐太宗曾嘲笑过秦始皇和汉武帝，说秦始皇想求长生被方士骗了，说汉武帝求神仙，把女儿也嫁给了方士。可惜没想到的是晚年的唐太宗也迷恋上了长生不老，长生不死，甚至还被所谓的“不老神药”毒死。新旧唐书和资治通鉴都有唐太宗晚年食丹药的记载，类似吃长生不老药。史料记载，“服胡僧药，遂致暴疾不救”。[2]
跟唐太宗一样，嘉靖皇帝也迷恋长生不老，长生不死，大量服食丹药。…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched but even though it has been 6 years since the release of Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is STILL making the same mistakes. It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. 

I saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.

Halo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. 

So again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release

Landing your first engineering role after getting a degree in computer science (or software engineering) is a challenging process. 
There are so many software engineering vacancies, but a significant majority of them are for those with at least 2+ years of experience. There are not enough junior positions on the market, so the competition for entry-level roles is high. Yet, it is still possible to land an engineering role, even without experience. 
The following tips are mainly dedicated to computer science or software engineering graduates looking to land their first engineering role. However, self-taught developers and boot-camp graduates can still benefit from this article.
I&#x27;m going to list five actionable steps that I hope can help you land your first …</span>

Testing it: check the console in inspect to see how it increments and decrements.

This repo shows the use of redux it could be one a proper way with the store and multiple reducers their own folders.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://dev.to/daholino/fetch-and-display-the-latest-git-commit-hash-in-your-ios-apps-1fp2">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.
Displaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.
In this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.
The procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.
The first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.
When you move it, you can paste this code for the script:
GIT&#x3D;&#x60;xcrun -find git&#x60;
GIT_REV&#x3D;&#x60;${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD&#x60;
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c &quot;Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}&quot; &quot;${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}&quot;

In the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.
Now, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.
To display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:

This article presents an open-source Flask Dashboard crafted with authentication, database, and Docker support on top of Azia Admin, a colorful dashboard template. The product can be used to prototype fast a new dashboard on top of the existing codebase. For newcomers, Flask is a leading framework written in Python used to code from simple websites to microservices, APIs, or complex eCommerce solutions. 
Thanks for reading!

👉 Flask Azia Admin - LIVE Demo

Azia Dashboard is a beautifully designed admin template featuring a fine selection of useful Bootstrap components and elements. The pre-built pages of the templates are intuitive and very well-designed.
Azia features many essential utility classes that can help cut down CSS bloat and modify CSS components instantly.
The product requires a minimal programming kit to be present and properly installed in the workstation in order to clone and compile the sources:
Python3 - the language that powers Flask
GIT - used to download the sources from Github
A modern editor like VsCode or Atom


Docker - (optional) for an automatized setup
Probably the most easier way to use the product is via Docker, a popular virtualization and containerization software.
👉 Step #1 - Download the source code
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-azia-dashboard.git
$ cd flask-azia-dashboard

👉 Step #2 - Start in Docker
$ docker-compose pull   # download dependencies 
$ docker-compose build  # local set up
$ docker-compose up -d  # start the app 

Once all the above commands are executed, we should see the starter running in the browser at the address http://localhost:85

                    <span>Storecle is a neat uni-directional app state management for React and Solid (❤️).
Storecle uses a simple mental model which lets you access app-wide actions and their results by using Context API.
To improve the code re-usability, Data Suppliers use a middleware pattern. They are executed in the order you specify and pass a snapshot of Store from one to another, letting you split the logic into small, specified functions.
It works with both React and Solid (it&#x27;s framework agnostic to certain degree).
It uses Context API and useEffect / createEffect to provide action re-triggers based on specified Store changes.
It facilitates splitting the business logic into granual, re-usable functions by applying a middleware pattern.
It simplifies naming and reduces noise by letting you access action r…</span>

The term CRUD comes from  &quot;Create,&quot; &quot;Read,&quot; &quot;Update&quot;, and &quot;Delete.&quot;  We create CRUDs Applications using the HTTP Verbs. In this tutorial we are also going to learn how to connect and use  a MongoDB Database in a Nodejs application. In this tutorial we assume that you have some JavaScript knowledge. We also assume that you have read something about MongoDB. You can take this tutorial as a second part for our Nodejs and Express Tutorial. Now let us start learning.

I am a backend software engineer in N26, Barcelona office. In N26 we use kotlin and we build microservices, as you can imagine, to run the digital bank.
We were working on a backoffice microservice, that somehow handled some data about our customers and exposed some endpoints to change them (like a CRUD but not exactly).
So I cannot tell the problem using the same data because those are privileged, but I can explain the same problem using a simpler example.
Suppose you have a model in your application to store information about a Person:
data class Person(
 val name: String, 
 val address: Address
)

data class Address(
 val streetName: String, 
 val number: String, 
 val city: String
)

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin. Today, I&#x27;d like to talk about my experience of publishing my static site generator to NPM. It&#x27;s quite a fun experience as I finally made my project up and running in public.
I&#x27;ve used this as instruction to publish it to NPM.
You can check it out here
Because I already built my project for quite a long time so, I can skip most of the steps, and just focus on this step and some steps that help me understand the semantic versioning and dist-tags. 
When I first start using command line npm publish to publish the project, I had to sign up and log in to NPM. But I encountered an error where it said something like this
npm ERR! code E403

                    <span>If you were building an application consisting of a user interface and an API, what technology choices would you make and why?
I&#x27;ll go first.
1. TypeScript
2. React &amp; Next.js
React is a battle-tested library for building UI&#x27;s. It has good documentation and a large community. There are so many components already implemented and ready to use, so you don&#x27;t have to build everything yourself.
Next.js has been around for only a couple of years, but it is already one of the most popular tools in the React ecosystem. Next.js offers you so much out of the box. SSR, file-system-based routing, has the potential to improve metrics such as time-to-first-draw (TTFD) and so much more...
3. PostgreSQL or MongoDB

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but I fall asleep every time I’m trying to read typescript documentation. There is something in the way it is written that signals to my brain that I should not even attempt to comprehend it until I had a good night’s sleep, three coffees, and ideally some chocolate to stimulate the brain cells. I think I now found my purpose for the next few months: I want to re-write typescript documentation in a way that is actually understandable by a casual reader 😊
Let&#x27;s start with one of the pain points many developers are struggling with: generics! And we’re going to start with a bottom-up approach: let’s implement a component without generics, and introduce them only when we need them.
