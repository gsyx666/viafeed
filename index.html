                    <span>Think about this for a moment. You can find a great deal of reasons to make side projects – such as learning, having fun or creating something that will be used and appreciated by others. It requires an ample amount of creativity and hard work. 
Even though some may disagree, I think that there is way more pros than cons to this. In this series, we are going to write a little bit of code together and see what can be accomplished.
Our first project is called React Digital Display. As the name suggests, it is a React component, which displays text. Although it looks quite simple, we will add one lovely feature: it will be able to take different components as display modules and use them under the hood. For example, it can be a 7-segment module, or a dot matrix, or anything you can imagine. I…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.JSON is &quot;self-describing&quot; and easy to understand. JavaScript objects are an integral part of the React app, so they need to get accessed from JSON files/data to be uses in components.
This blog will demonstrate how to get a JavaScript object from a JSON file or access it using a fetch() HTTP request.
Create one sample JSON file as given below, and save it as data.json
{
&quot;employees&quot;:{
&quot;employee1&quot;: {&quot;firstName&quot;:&quot;John&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Doe&quot;},
&quot;employee2&quot;: {&quot;firstName&quot;:&quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Smith&quot;},
&quot;employee3&quot;: {&quot;firstName&quot;:&quot;Peter&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;}

Even amid such an upsurge, from the beginning of 2021 till now, a lot of cryptocurrencies have made very good returns to their investors. According to data from Coinmatrics, there are 35 cryptocurrencies that have given an average return of 2,400% this year.

On top of this comes the name of Axie infinity, which is a Play To Earn Blockchain game that has given a tremendous 17,213% returns this year, same category Blockchain gaming project Sandbox has also given 13,832% returns.
Matic, which is working on Ethereum&#x27;s Layer 2 Solution, has given 12,133% to its investors. Investors&#x27; eyes are very much on Matic as it is contributing hugely to scaling Ethereum and right now Matic is also working on many projects. It is working, due to which the investor expects it will increase further.
During so many difficulties, the world&#x27;s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, did not anger people too much, from the beginning of this year to the end, Bitcoin has given a return of 62%, while the second number cryptocurrency Ethereum has given a return of 433%.
As awareness is increasing among people about NFT, DeFi, its biggest advantage will be the leader cryptocurrency of this category, Ethereum. Everyone is eagerly waiting for Ethereum 2.0. With its arrival, Ethereum&#x27;s network will see a lot of booms, and people will get rid of the high gas fees and its slow transaction speed.
Its developers are working on Ethereum 2.0, it is expected that it will be completed by 2022, after which there will be no one to compete with Ethereum.
Disclaimer
Do not invest your money in any cryptocurrency without doing your own research, as you will find many crypto projects that will lure you to give you high returns, but you should not invest money anywhere without doing research.</span>

Amazon is the big wheel of eCommerce. In 2021, it had more than 146,396 million U.S. dollars sales, which is expected to grow over 162K million U.S. Dollars by 2022. All the amazon businesses dream of being on page one, and it is obvious that the company listed on page one will have more visibility, so have more leads to convert. But how to hold a place on Amazon page one? The answer is- Amazon SEO. You need to learn and master Amazon Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This is the most reliable method to generate sales compared to Amazon PPC, influencer partnerships, other paid ads, etc.

                    <span>Okay, I am fairly new to GitHub. And initially, I used to struggle a lot with adding my local projects to GitHub. 
Git on your local machine
Here is a neat article to help with that.
Do not initialize .gitignore or readme at this point.
In this file, add all the folder and the file extensions that you wouldn&#x27;t want in the remote repository. 
*.class

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.ear

# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml
hs_err_pid*

#folders
logs/
target/

#other
*.classpath
*.project
*.settings
*.pdf

In your local, navigate to the project folder from your favorite command prompt 
git init -b main
git add .
git status
git commit -m &quot;commit message&quot;
On a side note, it&#x27;s a great practice to keep committing to your local in small increments. That way, if you see that a code change is breaking and don&#x27;t know which line did that, it&#x27;s easy to revert back to a stable version.
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo
git push origin main
git pull origin main
That&#x27;s it, you did it :)</span>

                    <span>At some point in your journey as a developer, you might have come across this error.

The above error occurs as a result of trying to use the forEach array method on an htmlCollection.
Well, an htmlCollection is a live and ordered list of nodes that represents a collection of HTML elements extracted from the DOM. 
The htmlCollection may seem very much like an array, but it is not. That’s why whenever you try to use array methods like forEach(), push(), or join() on an htmlCollection, you get different types of errors similar to the one above.
Another collection of objects that happens to be very similar to the htmlCollection, is the nodeList. While they may both be an array-like list of html elements, the htmlCollection is a live list while the nodeList can either be live or static.

                    <span>Most software companies struggle with releasing quality code that doesn&#x27;t break critical user workflows.
Companies invest significant dollars in testing their product to counter this but often ship a P0 bug anyway.
Here are 5 root causes for software bugs.
A common mistake and often a harder one to fix during the nascent phases of software.
Naturally, if the pre-production environment never hits an edge case that can occur in production, it is impossible to validate enhancements accurately.
Thought: Deploy a snapshot of the production environment as a pre-release environment.
Engineering teams write code to work in the &quot;present&quot; and the &quot;future&quot;, making version testing hard. Software should not be forward-facing.
Example: Release #1 deploys software with a v1 dependency, and release #2 now uses a v2 version of the dependency. This change is non-idempotent - we wipe out a variable value by storing only the latest state. 
What happens to the deployed state that works with a v1 dependency? Does it break or work with the new release?
Thought: Always support X states of existing data. Streamline rollbacks.
As more folks campaign for infrastructure as code, we move towards automating infrastructure deployments.
But does a change in automation break existing infrastructure?
Thought: Can backward compatibility testing solve this problem?
Assuming the network behaves the same irrespective of time and region is a recipe for software failure.
Thought: Can Edge Testing gauge pre-release software inconsistencies?
With the microservices architecture, a change in one service can cause a failure in unrelated user functionality. Testing a new release in a silo for a fixed subset of features doesn&#x27;t help.
Thought: Replay tests for all critical user workflows for every release to generate an accurate failures heatmap.
Let me know if you&#x27;ve solved any of these mistakes and how.
Until later! :)</span>

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen syntax like this before where properties are omitted using commas:
const fruits &#x3D; [&#x27;🍎&#x27;, &#x27;🥭&#x27;, &#x27;🍉&#x27;, &#x27;🍋&#x27;]
const [,,,lemon] &#x3D; fruits
console.log(lemon) // 🍋

To me this looks messy. A developer has to look at the number of commas to understand which property was taken from the array and if you need grab a few values not next to each other it can become very unwieldy.
Thankfully, in JS, arrays are really just obj…</span>

                    <span>In May, RippleX invited the developer community to provide feedback on our proposal to enhance NFT support on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
We believe crypto and blockchain are powerful levelers in unlocking access and equity for everyone. The rapid rise and growth of non-fungible tokens – or NFTs – is key to that vision. On track to surpass $17B in global sales by the end of this year, it’s clear that NFTs are here to stay with many in the industry already building toward a tokenized future that allows new business models to prosper and people to engage more deeply with the communities and things they care most about.
Today the NFT-Devnet is available, making it possible for all developers to learn about and experiment with the native NFT capabilities introduced with XLS-20d. Developers are welc…</span>

                    <span>Recently I decided to take on the task of automating my site&#x27;s build and deployment process through GitHub Actions. I&#x27;m using my own static site generator Cleaver to handle that, which requires both Node + PHP to be installed in order to run the asset compilation and build process. Now, GitHub Actions supports both of those runtimes out of the box, but I had just created a perfectly good Docker image for using Cleaver, and instead wanted to use that.
Ultimately it was a mixture of just wanting the fine-grain control that a single Docker image provides, and because, well I just wanted to see how to do it!
So, you&#x27;re able to actually use Docker images in GitHub actions, but by default you&#x27;re only able to use them one of two ways.

                    <span>I have developed a small social network web app for educational purpose and want to share this with the community. This app is built with ReactJS for frontend, Java Spring Boot for backend and MongoDB as the database.
The app tries to mimic a few functions of Twitter, including:
Create post with text and image
The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters
Like, comment and re-post a post
View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post
Comments are toggle
The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters
Follow, un-follow someone
See who are following us and follow them back
Check who we are following
View all posts of an individual
View our own posts
List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)
Other functions:
Due to limited storage space, client app compresses the uploaded image to the maximum of 250px (width or height) 
User avatar is created by hashing user id and convert that hash code into a hexagonal image
Authentication and authorization use JWT
Responsive frontend for desktop and mobile devices
Technical stack:
Frontend: ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Bootstrap
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Database: MongoDB
Hope you enjoy it and if this project is useful for you , please give me a ⭐ Github star ⭐ for my effort!

                    <span>The Problem
One big Con of working remotely is the lack of an office vibe and team spirit.
Many try going to physical Co-Working spaces but they tend to be expensive and noisy and for digital nomads that jump around constantly it&#x27;s hard to develop meaningful relationships.
Virtual Co-Working Space
To fix that I started building a remote co-working space that entrepreneurs can access no matter where they are.
Now I have more than 50 members and some have even already met in person.
Besides having the slack channel we also have always available virtual rooms where people can work or hang together and events like hackathons, random coffees, and workshops.
Would love to hear your thoughts on the idea. Would you see yourself using such a service?
Cheers</span>

                    <span>If you ever get error messages in the command line interface after creating a new react app with the create-react-app command, just like the image below, then this fix might help you out.

The first thing we do is deleting the starter files in the src path except the index.js and app.js files, ending up with the result in the below image.

The next step involves deleting every starter file in the public path except the index.html file just like below

In The next step, we will delete some code in the index.js file so that we don&#x27;t have dependency imports that might trigger errors. 

We will also delete some code in the index.html file to get rid of some of the deleted dependencies.

After you are finished with finding all the imports that are not used anymore and removing them, there should not be any more errors in the terminal. I hope this helped you out.
Thanks.</span>

                    <span>A while back I remember coming across one example online for finding a case-insensitive letter that looked like this:
/[A-z]/

Just to make sure it&#x27;s crystal clear, that&#x27;s a range from uppercase A to lowercase z.
I thought this would be a great and concise way to do the job, but I came to realize it was not quite doing what I thought it would.
/[A-z]/


While I initially thought this would be fine, I was getting some unexpected results when I used it. Here&#x27;s a screenshot from Rubular showing what I started seeing:

The expression is successfully finding lowercase and uppercase letters, but it&#x27;s also grabbing a few extra symbols. Where is this coming from?
Well if we take a look at the ASCII table, we&#x27;ll notice that the uppercase alphabetical letters are codes 65 through 90, and that the lo…</span>

                    <span>React-router is the standard library for routing in react js. It allows users of a react app to move between different sections (components) of the app.
The react-router team  announced the release  of a stable version of react-router version 6 (v6) towards the end of 2021, but switching from react-router version 5 (v5) to v6 may be difficult due to some big breaking API changes. In this article, we will walk through what is new in v6 and how to upgrade an existing React project from v5 to v6.
To upgrade the version of the react-router package in our app, we navigate to the project folder and run
npm install react-router-dom@[VERSION_NUMBER]
Replace VERSION_NUMBER with the version we want to install, or with “latest” if we want the latest version, like so:
npm install react-router-dom@6

小弟最近在学习 react,在做一个 demo 的时候遇到一个问题: 点击 header 组件的 full screen 按钮,将整个应用都全屏.
使用了 ahooks 的一个useFullscreen.

现在的难点在于:我如何使用 ref 获得到最外层的组件(APP).

尝试了 forwordRef 好像只能从外往内(app--&gt;header)也就是从 app 可以获得 header 的 ref
而不能从内往外(header--&gt;app)不能从 header 获得 app 的 ref.
小弟也刚开始学习 React,也不知道表述的清楚不清楚.在线求大佬们解答!!!</span>

一加 8P ，氢 OS + TWRP + root ，想刷个 ColorOS 12 玩玩。
找到了内测包，OTA 包里面是 payload.bin ，用 payload dumper 直接解包。
接下来我犯了个致命错误，没有进 fastboot 刷而是进到了 TWRP 的 fastbootd 里刷，关机之后直接变砖，屏幕不亮，无论是按键还是充电都无反应，连 usb 到电脑也没发现新设备，自然高通的 9008 模式也没用。
无奈约了售后（现在一加的售后全交给 OPPO 了），售后小哥拆机拔电池（为了强制关机）再连也没反应，说只能换主板，要 2k+，只能作罢……
有没有大佬能分析下到底发生了什么事？搞机也不是一天两天了，在不同的手机上刷过好多系统，刷机能把硬件搞坏还是第一次遇到。</span>

试着把离 iPad 最近的 AP 关了，发现就好了，然后再把 AP 开起来也没问题，但是只要重启 iPad 问题又回来了。试过用之前在用的 Mesh 路由，也是可以复现一样的问题，关掉最近的节点可以解决，再打开也没事。最开始怀疑是 802.1r 的兼容性有关，但是神奇的是家里别的所有苹果设备都没这个问题，仅仅是这台 iPad ，又让我觉得可能是硬件问题。
不知道有没有朋友碰到过一样的情况，显然这个拿去 Apple Store 也很难当场复现，网上问客服也就是让重置网络设置 /重启路由器。虽然只要不重启就不影响使用吧，但是感觉还是很难受，尤其是之后返工也没法开关场所里的固定 AP ，等于说没法带出门用。。。
iOS 版本：15.2 
AP：U6-LR-US
Mesh：RBK852</span>

                    <span>mz: 背景：
有一个 name.com 注册的域名，但不想折腾各种博客程序，想通过 301 隐形转发到一个固定的 page 页来当博客。
问题：
1 ）通过 name.com 隐性转发是否可用？国内能生效吗？
2 ）按照 dnspod 的转发，需要对域名、服务器北岸。域名可以北岸，但服务器如果是 notion 无法北岸。
3 ）是否有可用的免北岸支持 301 隐性转发的服务商？

                    <span>lerry: 统招本科，13 年毕业，大学时开始自学 Python ，这些年做后端和前端的时间各一半吧。
技术，在经历过的团队里都算不错的。不止一次有以前的上司创业要拉我去当技术负责人，或者同事要拉我入伙搞事情。
自驱力，还可以，期间也做过几个月的远程工作，之前写博客，后来都是在笔记软件上写东西。
带团队，从 15 年开始，前端和 Python 都带过，最多的时候四五个人，也独立负责过项目。
英语，读写没问题，口语一般，用的少。
自我评价，自认为是个靠谱的人，每一份工作都是真心把产品当作自己的作品来对待的。
个人更倾向于做后端，不排斥转语言，Golang 自学过一些也挺喜欢。

17 年毕业，在福州工作，20 年 7 月裸辞，只待过一家公司。
（ 21 年出了些事，比较抑郁，最近才开始准备。）
目前问题：
1 、技术太渣。
在前公司薪资都不到 10k ，项目基本上做的单体应用+一个很 low 的网关（用 spring cloud gateway 简单做转发），都没体会到微服务。
所以最近边看八股文，边重写网关优化下，还打算去看看 SpringCloud 源码。估计下个月才能开始找工作。
2 、纠结去厦门找双休公司，还是直接去一线城市。
因为都说现在内卷很严重，自己看了那些面试题发现好多不会，所以打算过完年先在福州面试看看，然后直接去厦门找非外包+互联网公司（目标 13k ），待到年底，再去杭州 /北京。
不知道这个计划怎样，毕业后没出去面试过，加上紧张，我估计前期面十家都没 offer ，或者连面试机会都没有。
211 毕业，看着同学们慢慢去大厂开始准备买房买车，现在有点焦虑。。
希望大家能给一些建议，，然后想问下行情怎么样，特别是厦门 /杭州</span>

前两年都在一家做交换机的工作负责一些底层开发，使用 C 语言，主要做数据分析这一类，然后今年回家了，准备在老家找工作
问题：
根本就找不到对口工作，老家这边几乎没有用 C 开发底层的工作，也基本没有通讯设备开发
    
目前设想的解决方案：
1. 先把差不多对口的职业发完简历，面试完
2. 不行就准备去学一些新的东西，通过在招聘平台看了一圈，这边比较多的是 java ，嵌入式，PLC （本人是自动化专业的，所以做 PLC 也可以）但是不是很确定如果转头做这些，又需要多久入门

万事开头难啊，从大城市往小城市走，工作内容不对口的弊端在程序猿这个行业好像暴漏的淋漓尽致的。以前的很多知识和经验感觉都都用不上了</span>

                    <span>yaoyao1128: 
2 月回韩复学，这两年的网络技术变化感觉比较快，因此想了解一下是否有必要在宽带上硬件防护。
同时也比较好奇现在的这个计算机发展状态下硬件防护对于家庭 /团队 /小型企业是否还有必要性。
以及想要了解，硬件防护在上面的场景中与“pfsense / OPNsense / Linux + iptables / Windows Server 的路由功能”对比，优势还有哪些。
背景信息：
宽带上下行对等
根据现有的商品介绍和当年的实际测试，能够获取两个动态公网 IPv4 地址（但是没有 IPv6 ）
宽带 16 年的时候几乎无拦截（包括 25 端口）
当时主流宽带是 1Gbps ，但是现在也出现了差价不大的 2.5Gbps 产品，以及最高 10Gbps 的家庭宽带
大一放了一个小服务器，最开始接触的时候没做防护被各种攻击过，后来从 openwrt 开始，转移到 debian 自己搭建。最后用的 pfsense （那时候还没有 OPNsense ），在 1Gbps 的宽带下跑满没问题，外网速度也接近满速（学校-&gt;家）。
准备 80+443 对外。
附带求教：
如果准备接入 2.5Gbps 的宽带，是用中古 Intel 的服务器万兆电口网卡（不支持 2.5G ）+万兆交换机好呢，还是螃蟹家的全新 2.5G 网卡加 2.5G 交换机好呢？
万兆 /2.5G 交换机消费级除了 TPLINK 的还有相对低价的产品推荐吗？</span>

前提：北方，集中供暖（地暖），使用面积 98 平米
1 、看参数的话，风量 300 应该够了，但是考虑到新风产生的噪声，是不是选 400 左右的更好，这样抵挡运行声音更小？
2 、北方冬季不考虑辅热的话，体验如何？
3 、计划在北侧墙上装，北侧和南侧使用起来区别大吗？
4 、准备壁挂新风+空气净化器（已买小米净化器 max 增强版）+无雾加湿器这样的组合，顺便帮忙推荐一款壁挂新风和大加湿量的加湿器？
5 、其他可以分享的经验或者踩的坑。

                    <span>让 macOS 直接运行 iOS 程序已经不是什么新鲜的事情了。自从 M1 系列的 Mac 问世以来，我们在 Mac App Store 甚至可以直接下载安装受支持的 iOS 应用，并用键盘鼠标来模拟触摸操作在 macOS 上使用这些 iOS 应用。虽然已经有很多 iOS 应用直接支持了在 macOS 上的安装，还是有一些应用开发者为了减少开发成本或者担心其他因素，选择将自己的 iOS 应用从 Mac App Store 上移除。
如果我们依旧希望在系统架构完全支持的 M1 系列 Mac 上面使用这些应用，那么就需要特殊的手段 —— 旁加载，也就是 sideloading —— 才能安装这些 iOS 应用。这是 macOS 11.2.3 之前的常规操作，我们称这段时期为「前 macOS 旁加载」时代。
显然，Apple 并不想让我们轻松地就将未经验证、不受支持的 iOS 应用直接在 macOS 上成功运行。曾被允许的简单「旁加载」在 macOS 11.3 的更新中被 Apple 禁用，自然最新的 macOS Monterey 12.1 也不受支持。因此，在「后 macOS 旁加载」时代，我们需要 PlayCover —— 一个专门用于在 M1 Mac 上安装 iOS 应用的辅助程序的帮助，才能够完整地在 M1 Mac 上面安装并体验未受支持的 iOS 应用。

一种幸运
有些时候我会这么想：人生中开到的第一台车是 Mini Cooper，这本身需要足够的幸运。
在开车回家的路上，想起来了向老爸借钥匙泡夏树的拓海，在这些年逐渐的成长过程中理解了重野秀一笔下的青春。终有一天，我们也会变成这既最好也最坏的时代中的，那个深夜里望着车发呆的人。
始终要轮到自己开车，轮到自己去看看广阔的世界，也要载着朋友、家人一起出发。
MINI 在 BMW 化之后的今天似乎又有了诸多的改变（从小写变成了大写），而在经过了一段时间的熟悉之后，（我与）这辆车终于准备好了。
这样一台 2011 年的经典三门 Mini Cooper Excitement（代号 R56），搭载 120 马力横置直列四缸 1.6L 自然吸气 N12B16BA 引擎与爱信 6 速手自一体变速箱，原配倍耐力 195/45 R16的星标防爆轮胎，至今已经行驶了十一万公里。

本文仅以 2021 年少数派线下聚会与老麦的约定为契机，谨献所有对 Mini Cooper 依然抱有兴趣的人们。
2021 年双 11 傍晚，与老麦再度相见，终有机会一起合影
关于 Mini Cooper 的 Q&amp;A
Q：你喜欢这辆车吗？
A：爱恨交加。要说爱有多深，恨就有多切。事实上，我并不喜欢开车这件事，甚至也因为停车困难和保养的麻烦一度抵触开车。但在马路上驰骋的和弯道上的快乐是不会忘记的，Mini 也当然是一辆能够令我笑出声的好车。
Q：Mini 适合女性吗？
A：Mini 适合所有人，但并不是每一代都是如此。女性标签是 Mini 的重要特色之一，但却不是最重要的。我在…</span>

                    <span>谢邀！
很荣幸能来和大家分享《紫川》的创作历程，我叫陈闻，我和李振锋李导，共同任职《紫川》项目的导演。首先跟大家同步一个消息，原本预定18号上线的互动剧第2章《血修罗》，在本周播出的第五集中，看“一”送“二”，提前和观众见面了，大家别忘记看哈！
《紫川》上线以来，我和李导关注了平台上的各种反馈，对于观众的意见和建议，我们都一一记在了小本本上，很感谢大家的反馈，那些都是我们未来努力的方向。 其中有一个意外，那就是《紫川》讨论词条中的最多的竟然是“互动隐藏剧”，怎么说呢，这个意外真的很让人意外……其实，和大家评论的一样，《紫川》的互动形式，属于轻互动，就是在正集一些特殊的剧情点，增设了不影响主线的“隐藏剧集”按钮，观众老爷无论是选择“穿越”观看，还是看完正集，再返回来观看，都是可以的。（宝，你什么都是对的.jpg）
“番剧互动”这样的概念，我们其实是在项目策划初期就已经提出。我们主要是想给观众更多的选择，但是经过测试，发现剧集暂停→观众选择→剧集播出→剧集暂停→观众选择，这样的形式，不仅影响剧情节奏，还非常废手，尤其是废的还是观众老爷的手，这就得慎重考量了。（正义由我来守护.jpg）
之后，我们发现《紫川》第一部《紫川三杰》更偏群像戏，比如说，虽然紫川秀是男主角，但其他两位“斯特林”和“帝林”的戏份也非常重要，可是他们常常各自为战，主角紫川秀没有在他身边，导致剧情不是由主角推动的，这会让故事有割裂感。[让人头秃.jpg]
综合考量后，团队决定将一些主角没有参与，但是非常重要的戏份，以及一些不同时间线的比较精彩的戏份，规划到了隐藏剧环节，比如隐藏互动剧《血修罗》中，冷酷铁血的帝林军团为了胜利，就地掠夺以战养战；为了永绝后患，将身高超过车轮的魔族全部杀掉，播种“恐惧”；为了保证军团作战利益最大化，将奴隶军团送上前线……这段故事中，有充满魅力的人设，外加大规模群集特效、丰富的兵种、血肉对拼的攻城战氛围，虽然游离在主角主线之外，非常经典可看！于是我们将这段戏份单独做成了隐藏互动剧集，和正集一起呈现给观众。
可以这么理解，《紫川》中，正剧是还原原著剧情主线，互动隐藏剧主要是为了细化扩展重点人物故事！ [就这么愉快的决定了.jpg]
 好吧，编不下去了，我摊牌了！《紫川》看“一”送“二”的行为，纯粹就是为了能让观众老爷多看点！[不管你信不信，反正我信了.jpg]

                    <span>Test-driven development (TDD) and test automation are great ways to reduce bugs arising from subsequent changes.
It&#x27;s widespread to run tests inside the continuous integration (CI) pipeline. It takes away a ton of precious developer time from the repetitive testing tasks.
A fantastic option we have to build CI pipelines is GitHub Actions. Using GitHub as the code repository, you can set triggers and run tasks in a workflow. These tasks automatically start whenever you push changes to the repository.
Despite solving a complex problem, GitHub Actions are surprisingly straightforward to configure. In this short article, I&#x27;ve discussed,

Some of them I learned while doing some research for this blog post, which was my hope to motivate myself to learn more shortcuts. It&#x27;s great how a little key binding can really boost your productivity and fun while coding. Many of these will be familiar, but they are techniques I wish I had known on day one!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been running my website on Azure Static Web Apps for a while and it is pretty cool.
When you create a Static Web App on Azure you get asked for the github repo of your source code and even the branch to use.

Once you have selected this, you get asked for the type of code to deploy, mine is Blazor Web Assembly but you can use Angular, React or Vue.

I get something like this

  push:
    branches:

But if you&#x27;re unsure, VoIP systems basically refer to technologies that allow voice and video communication via internet connection.
But here is where it gets complicated, it turns out that there are VoIP and Non VoIP phone numbers, I will try to explain this as best as possible as it is a bit confusing at the beginning.
VoIP and Non VoIP belong to one category: Virtual Numbers, and they both have the same technology have in common.
But first of all. What are virtual phone numbers? They are those that allow people to communicate through the internet, and using this valuable tool you can communicate with any number in the world and still be as cheap as calling from…</span>

                    <span>I wrote my first end-to-end functioning web application using Ruby on Rails in a class at MIT (6.170) in 2013. There were things that Rails automatically handled for me that I didn’t even realize were hard to do. Running rails new just set up a completely functioning application. I never had to consider all of the components I would need to string together. Database migrations, routing, run and deploy scripts, tests, handling static assets, and more worked out of the box and the documentation clearly described how to build every part of my application. In fact, I assumed that writing web applications should always be this easy because I had never tried to write one from scratch.

Olá, me chamo João e me encontrei com um grande problema. Estava desenvolvendo um projeto no qual consumia uma API, para ser mais exato, está API era disponibilizada pela rapidApi. Como sou um mero mortal(e estudante), estava utilizando do plano gratuito. Contudo, esse disponibiliza apenas 500 requests por mês. Sério, consegui estourar esse limite em um dia kkkkk.Seria impossivel desenvolver o app com tantas poucas requisições.
Para recriar o ambiente no qual estava, criarei uma API super simples com Express, utilizarei do Axios para fazer as requisições e claro, faremos os testes com o Jest.
A api ficou bem simples. Basicamente criei uma rota que recebe um query e retorna um JSON. Além disso fiz uma funç…</span>

Weak references are not often used in JavaScript due to how the language is designed. However, in certain circumstances, they can prove vital, such as when developers must store additional data and need to automatically manage the memory usage.
In this post, we’ll learn about these weak references in JavaScript and how we can use them by utilizing two objects within the language: WeakMap and WeakSet.
Let’s start by taking a look at what a normal, or strong, reference is in JavaScript. In its simplest definition, a strong reference is a reference that keeps an object in memory. Let’s take a look at this in practice to understand what we are talking about:
let dog &#x3D; { name: &quot;badger&quot; };

const pets &#x3D; [dog];

dog &#x3D; null;

console.log(pets); // [{ name: &quot;badger&quot; }]

                    <span>What is DevSecOps methodology?


DevSecOps—short for development, security, and operations—adds security-first thinking into every phase of the software development pipeline, helping engineering teams deliver secure software with speed and at scale. 
Previously, development teams performed security testing after the development cycle, meaning they handed work over to separate QA and security teams for final inspection. As software development teams adopted DevOps practices, particularly continuous integration and deployment, security reviews created costly bottlenecks by backloading important work at the final stages of the delivery pipelines. Teams only uncovered issues after features had been built, meaning they were costlier and more difficult to debug and fix.

                    <span>开源开发者自毁其广泛使用的依赖库

开源库 colors.js 和 faker.js 被广泛使用。在 NPM 上，colors.js 的周下载量超过 2000 万次，有近 19000 个项目依赖它。前几天，它的开发者在这些库的最新版本中加入了无限循环和乱码，依赖它的项目会在控制台看到不停打印的非 ASCII 字符。他将这两个库的 自毁版本 推送到了 GitHub 和 NPM，因而导致多个使用这些依赖库的软件出现故障，其中包括亚马逊的 AWS CDK。这位开发者似乎是因为没有得到使用他的开源软件的大公司的 付费，而专门做了这种破坏。这件事引来了业界和社区的激烈讨论。


老王点评：我认为，你可以因没有得到报酬而放弃项目，但是这不是你蓄意报复的理由。如果一开始就想着获益，请发布你的商业版本。这种最初遵循开源许可证和开源文化的开源软件，在邀名不成、获利不得后恼羞成怒地大肆破坏，或许没有违反许可证和法律，但是却给整个开源文化泼了一盆脏水。我对这种行为持反对意见。




Mozilla 基金会其实从 2014 年就开始接受加密货币捐款

之前我们报道过，Mozilla 基金会官方 Twitter 账号在 1 月 1 日提醒粉丝它接受加密货币，如比特币、以太坊的捐款，但这一声明招致了 猛烈批评，最终迫使 Mozilla 基金会宣布 暂停 接受加密货币捐款。但实际上 Mozilla 基金会从 2014 年就开始 接受加密货币捐款，当时 Mozilla 还列举了其它接受加密货币捐款的组织，如可汗学院、电子前沿基金会、绿色和平组织和维基媒体基金会。到今天，只有绿色和平组织停止接受加密货币捐款。


老王点评：加密货币是否该死，我觉得不能用政治正确来评判。




Windows 11 上仍能使用软驱和软盘

去年发布的 Windows 11 系统，调整了硬件安装需求，很多硬件都不再支持，需要使用较新的 CPU 和 TPM 2.0 等等。但是，有用户发现，Windows 11 上居然还可以成功使用索尼 5.25 寸软盘。这意味着，Windows 11 对外部设备还保留了不错的兼容性。


老王点评：虽然 5.25 寸、3.5 寸软盘已经基本退出历史舞台，可在特定领域依然有用武之地，但这个反差让我有些吃惊。</span>

                    <span>有 几个可用于 Linux 的截图工具，我喜欢 使用 Flameshot 进行截图 和 Shutter 来编辑现有的截图。

但不幸的是，Flameshot 不能在 4K 屏幕上工作。因此，我不得不使用默认的 GNOME 截图工具，它在我的带有超高清屏幕的戴尔 XPS 上工作得非常好。



这一“被迫之举”让我意识到，如果你知道如何正确使用，GNOME 截图 并不是一个糟糕的工具。

在这里，我指的是用键盘快捷键来使用它，因为这样可以节省大量的时间。

让我展示一下如何像专家一样用那些方便的键盘快捷键来使用 GNOME 截图应用。

我假定你没有改变这里的默认的截图的键盘快捷键。

对整个屏幕进行截图：使用 Prt Scr 键

这是最简单的操作。在你的键盘上找到 Prt Sc（或称 Prt Scr、Prt Scn）键并按下它。它将对整个屏幕进行截图，并将其保存在你的主目录下的图片文件夹中。



在某些发行版（或版本）中，你可能会看到是否要保存截图的选项，但大多数情况下，它会自动保存屏幕截图。

这里需要注意的另一件事是，如果你有多个屏幕连接到系统上，它会把所有的屏幕一起截图。这意味着，你会得到一个超宽的图像。

但是，如果你只想对某个应用进行截图，而不是对整个屏幕进行截图呢？

给一个应用程序的窗口截图：使用 Alt+Prt Scr 键

要给正在运行的图形应用截图，你需要这样做：

点击正在运行的应用，使其获得焦点。现在，按住 Alt 键并按 Prt Scr 键。

它将得到应用窗口的截图，并保存到图片目录中。



这样获取的截图也有一个阴影效果，看起来很不错。

这很好，但如果你只想给某个特定区域截图，而不是整个屏幕呢？这也有一个技巧。

对屏幕的选定区域进行截图：使用 Shift+Prt Scr 键

按住 Shift 键。然后按 Prt Scr 键。你会看到屏幕上出现一个选框。将鼠标移动到所需的区域，开始拖动光标。它将高亮显示该区域，并在你释放鼠标后立即进行截图。



复制截图到剪贴板而不是保存它们

当你在和别人聊天时，要和对方分享屏幕截图时，这非常有用。



首先截图，但没必要将保存的截图文件附在聊天工具中。相反，你可以直接将截图复制到剪贴板，然后使用 Ctrl+V 快捷键将图像（从剪贴板）粘贴到聊天工具。

这样，你的系统就不会保留不必要的截图，你也可以节省一些鼠标点击次数。

要把截图保存到剪贴板，以便你能把它们粘贴到聊天工具、绘图工具或文档中，你必须把 Ctrl 键和你在前面几节中看到的其他截图快捷键一起使用。


Ctrl+Prt Scr：将整个屏幕的截图复制到剪贴板上。

Ctrl+Alt+Prt Scr：将应用窗口的截图复制到剪贴板上。

Ctrl+Shift+Prt Scr：将选定区域的截图复制到剪贴板上


我必须补充一点，在这种情况下，使用像 Flameshot 这样的工具 甚至更好一些，因为它允许你在将截图保存到剪贴板之前对其进行注释。这样，你可以很容易地高亮屏幕的重要部分。

在截图中添加延迟，以便对下拉菜单进行截图

到目前为止，一切都很好。你只需按下几个键，就可以随心所欲地进行截图了。

问题是，当你要对下拉菜单或右键动作等进行截图时。当你按下屏幕截图键时，想要的项目可能会消失。

为了处理这种情况，你可以对该区域或整个屏幕进行截图，但要有一个延迟。



在 GNOME 屏幕截图工具中，你可以选择添加这个延迟。例如，你添加了 6 秒的延迟。你点击截图按钮，有 6 秒时间来做/显示你想做的事情。6 秒后，它就会自动截图了。

你有什么技巧吗？

这就是我使用 GNOME 截图工具的所有技巧。如果你还没有广泛地使用它，你应该会发现它很有帮助。如果你已经是一个专家，也许你知道一些可以添加到本文中的东西？请在评论区与我们其他人分享吧。

                    <span>使得 DNS 难以理解的事情之一是它是 分布式的。有成千上万（也许是几十万？我不知道！）的权威性域名服务器authoritative nameserver，以及至少 1000 万个解析器。而且它们正在运行许多不同的软件！不同服务器运行着不同的软件意味着 DNS 的工作方式有很多不一致的地方，这可能导致各种令人沮丧的问题。

但是，与其谈论这些问题，我更感兴趣的是弄清楚 —— 为什么 DNS 是分布式的是一件好事？

为什么 DNS 是分布式的是件好事？

一个原因是 可扩展性 —— DNS 的分布式设计使其更容易扩展，对故障的恢复能力更强。我发现，尽管 DNS 已经有近 40 年的历史，但它的扩展性仍然很好，这真是令人惊讶。这一点非常重要，但这并不是这篇文章的主题。

相反，我想说的是，它是分布式的意味着你可以 控制 你的 DNS 的工作方式。你可以向巨大而复杂的 DNS 服务器中添加更多的服务器！添加你控制的服务器！

昨天我 在 Twitter 上问 为什么你要运行自己的 DNS 服务器，我得到了很多很好的答案，我想在这里总结一下。

你可以运行 2 种类型的 DNS 服务器

你可以运行 2 种主要类型的 DNS 服务器：


如果你拥有一个域名，你可以为该域名运行一个 权威名称服务器

如果你有一台电脑（或一个有很多电脑的公司），你可以运行一个 解析器 来为这些电脑解析 DNS。


DNS 不是静态数据库

我经常看到 DNS 的 “电话簿” 比喻，域名就像人名，IP 地址就像电话号码。

这是一个不错的思维模型。但是，“电话簿” 思维模型可能会使你认为，如果你对 google.com 进行 DNS 查询，你将永远得到相同的结果。而这是不正确的。

你在 DNS 查询中得到的记录可能取决于：

APM 提供帧率的相关数据，即 FPS(Frames Per Second) 数据。FPS 在一定程度上反映了页面流畅程度，但 APM 提供的 FPS 并不是很准确。恰逢手淘低端机性能优化项目开启，亟需相关指标来衡量对滑动体验的优化，帧率数据探索实践就此拉开。
在探索实践中，我们遇到了许多问题：
高刷手机占比相对不低，影响整体 FPS 数据
非人为滑动数据参杂在 FPS 中，不能直接体现用户操作体验
计算平均数据时，卡顿数据被淹没在海量正常数据中，一次卡顿是否只影响一个 FPS 值还是一次用户操作体验？
经过一段时间的探索，我们沉淀下来了一些指标，其中包括：滑动帧率、冻帧占比、scrollHitchRate、卡顿帧率。除了相关帧率指标之外，为了更好的指导性能优化，APM 还提供了帧率主因分析，同时为了更好的定位卡顿问题，也提供了卡顿堆栈。

下面是 APM 基于平台的特性，对帧率相关探索实践的详细介绍，希望本文可以给大家带来一些帮助。
系统渲染机制
在介绍指标的实现之前，首先需要了解系统是如何做渲染的，只有知晓系统渲染机制，才能帮助我们更好的进行帧率数据计算处理。
渲染机制是 Android 中重要的一部分，其中又牵扯甚广，包括我们常说的 measure/layout/draw 原理、卡顿、过度绘制等，都与其相关。在这里我们主要是对渲染流程进行整体了解，知晓后续需要计算哪几部分、通过系统 API 得到了哪几部分，以便计算出目标数据。
渲染流程

我们都知道，当触发渲染后，会走到 ViewRootImpl 的 scheduleTraversals。这时，scheduleTraversals 方法主要是向 Choreographer 注册下一个 VSync 的回调。当下一个 VSync 来临时，Choreographer 首先切到主线程（传 VSync 上来…</span>

                    <span>或许你跟我都有过同样的想法，就是之前市面上的显卡扩展坞，要是做成ITX主机该有多好，外观简约且特别同时尺寸也很紧凑，这次装的这台ITX主机，一定程度就实现了类似的效果。

01/ 机主的需求
这次机主算是“熟人”了，因为在19年的时候就找我定制组装过一台银欣的【小乌鸦】，时隔两年多，这次准备又弄台新机子。

机主的需求：整机预算10K范围，主要用于玩游戏，游戏分辨率锁定2K144（会决定显卡），可接受又灯光，但要求纯色简约。箱体一开始锁定ATX\MATX塔式箱体，后面又考虑希望有一定的方便性，所以改为ITX方案，所以除了箱体其余配置最终定为下面这样。

CPU：i7 11700
主板：微星B560I GAMING EDGE WIFI
显卡：XFX RX6600XT海外版
内存：芝奇皇家戟DDR4 16G*2
SSD：西数SN550 1T
电源：银欣 SX700-G
机箱：乔思伯V11
散热：乔思伯HX6200D
风扇：迎广 皇冠CROWN140
附件：火星MOD装机实验室定制线

 
其它平台选择建议
AMD方案：替换zen3+B550I即可，不过选AMD ZEN3平台会有问题，一个是B550I经常缺货（微星就经常没），另外就是价格也贵一点（对比11代主板要贵几百），而且没核显。所以当时这台机子就锁定了11代。
12代：这价位如果换i5 12600KF+Z690I也OK，价格大概贵几百（主要还是主板），性能略微高一点（对比11700），优势是未来升级空间，缺点是无核显跟贵一点。机主当时觉得没必要，所以就还是11代。大家抄作业可以按自己需求考虑。

 
02/ 关于乔思伯V11
这次的方案箱体选了乔思伯V11，对于ITX装机作业来说，箱体重要性类似汽车的底盘，会决定你其它配置如何搭配选择，所以按需选择是非常重要的。
前面说过机主的需求，最高性能需求就是游戏，所…</span>

MenubarX：菜单栏中的模块化浏览器

平台：macOS
关键词：菜单栏、浏览器

对于 macOS 来讲，「菜单栏」是系统交互中一个非常重要的组件，这里可以展示大量关键信息，而无需直接跳转到应用内；这一概念本身就与浏览器中的「书签」在设计逻辑上有一定的相似之处。MenubarX 就是将浏览器部分功能整合进 macOS 菜单栏的小工具。

就像浏览器中的书签栏概念一样，MenubarX 也能同时将多个网页开启，并以图标的方式，缩略展示在菜单栏中（目前实际测试中会有部分网页图标未能正确识别），方便用户快速启动。用户可以手动设置显示彩色图标，或是看起来会更加简洁的单色图标。

你还可以手动设置网页刷新时间，用来保存 / 随时同步某些网页信息：比如刷微博 / Twitter 等时间线属性的社交媒体平台，相当于在菜单栏便捷的基础上更进一步。
对于有对移动端做适配的网页，可以使用更多设备分辨率的显示模式：目前已经支持包括 iPhone SE、iPhone 8 / 11、iPad mini 以及桌面版多种显示比例。也可以更换 iOS / macOS 两种用户端代理。
除了方便网页开发人员快速预览之外，对于 PWA 适配度较高的网页：例如 Instagram，还可以以非常接近移动端 App 的体验来使用。

实际体验中，只要是有网页支持的服务，基本都可以使用 MenubarX 来固定到菜单栏中：包括但不限于音乐服务、股票动态，以及电商平台。如果你愿意，甚至还…</span>

                    <span>尽管疫情依然在全球肆虐，但值得庆幸的是今年 CES 全球消费电子展依然成功地在线下举办。虽然有相当一部分科技公司缺席线下展会，也让今年大展少了一些「炫酷」的概念产品露出；但是今年参展的大厂商依然在这一年一度的全球舞台上，展示了不少全新的技术。今年的 CES 消费电子展大致可以分为 5 个大类进行发布和展出：芯片、汽车、屏幕、智能家居和机器人，接下来就一起来看看他们到底画了那些有意思的「大饼」吧。
雷蛇模块化一体式电脑桌
雷蛇在今年的 CES 上推出的概念产品，基本都非常炫酷。首先是雷蛇口罩的全新升级款：雷蛇 Zephyr Pro 口罩。

去年雷蛇推出的概念口罩确实进行了量产，但和 CES 2021 上展示的原型产品相比，缺少扬声器，从而导致使用上还是存在着一些不便。今年的升级款总算是补完了这个功能，并且雷蛇宣布将会在 2022 年某些时候进行量产，售价 199.99 美元，包含一个 Zephyr Pro 口罩和 99 天的 N95 过滤器启动包。
而雷蛇 Zephyr Pro 口罩只是一个开胃菜，最吸引人发眼球的还是雷蛇全新的 Sophia 概念电竞桌。

雷蛇的 Sophia 概念电竞桌采用模块化设计，用户可根据自己的使用需求，定制桌面上的各个功能模块。它包含了 13 个可更换模块，其中包括温度显示屏、用于启动应用的触摸屏、用于 IM 聊天和显示日历的专用显示屏，配备手写笔的平板电脑，混音模块，Qi 无线充电模块，杯子加热器，CPU 和 GPU 参数显示屏，可更换的磁吸机箱，一个65 英寸或 77 英寸显示器……当然还少不了的颇具雷蛇特色的 RGB 跑马灯（RGB YES！）。

模块化设计在工程领域一向都是技术人员的噩梦，但不可否认它确实是极客用户以及客制化产品用户的 dream desk。不过一想到它量产的可能性，我还是先入手 199.99 美元的雷蛇口罩 Pro …</span>

对于 2019-nCoV 疫情前的世界最大的怀念，就是你几乎可以去世界上任何一个地方旅行，无奈那时候还是学生的我也缺乏环游世界的能力，不过也留下了足够回味许久的旅行碎片。最近我将过往的旅行摄影作品整理成了自己的第二本画册《喜歡跑來跑去》，收录了旅途中充满触感的自然体验以及狂妄的城市冒险，而这篇「城市漫步指南」就先聚焦一下城市，分享那些我游历在大阪、新加坡、纽约过程中捕捉的画面。
大阪 ：「百鬼夜行」
在大阪的几日几乎都在围绕吃，首站就是道顿堀。

虽然早在日剧和电影里看到这片区域无数次，但真实抵达的时候还是会有一种奇妙的穿越氛围。日本商业街有一种奇妙的密集感，说的倒不是游人，而是店家和琳琅满目的广告灯箱，再加上空中的电线系统，无论是主街还是拐角进入的某一巷，你都能感觉哪怕是看上去像小平楼的建筑中似乎也能容纳无数的食客，怎样也探索不完。

去日本的那年我沉迷于浓烈光影的街头摄影，大阪的夜晚是另一种美，除了拥挤的灯箱，擦得油亮的出租车在夜晚会反射并倒映丰富的光线，很容易拍出「大都会」的繁华感觉，但美丽的东西也是昂贵的，记得离开日本的那天从京都的晴鸭楼旅店打车到大阪机场，那是我此生最贵的出租车账单。

在道顿堀吃了许多东西，印象很深的有两个，一个就是主街上非常不起眼的章鱼烧店，只有一个窗口，卖点是每一只章鱼烧都有一整只小章鱼，而非寻常的章鱼脚，一口一个能得到丰富的咀嚼感受。最重要的是，做章鱼烧的小哥留着长发，加上胡须真的很像我当时非常迷恋的小田切让，如今关于口感和店名的记忆已经…</span>

我其实没有使用智能手表的需求，原来佩戴的西铁城五局电波表已经非常好用了：不需要充电、不需要手动校时，搭配定制表带当作装饰品也非常好看。
原装钢表带与定制牛皮表带
所以这是一次「深思熟虑」过的冲动消费，一方面是需要用消费让自己更快乐一些，另一方面也是希望补完三星全家桶，体验「Galaxy Ecosystem」到底能不能打。当然，Galaxy Watch4 一定要有让我眼前一亮的特性或功能，我才会像「陨石打到头」那般点击付款，其中就包括全新 Wear OS 以及发布会上看似非常厉害的「身体成分检测」功能。
现在这块手表在我手上使用也有两个月时间了，下面就来说说 Galaxy Watch4（以下简称 Watch4）给我带来了什么。
智能手表终究是一块表
相比传统手表，智能手表已然属于电子数码产品的范畴，但其本质还是一块表。手表就要守「表德」：颜值姣好、佩戴舒适、查看方便。Watch4 作为手表算是合格。
我手上这一块是 Watch4 44mm 幽谷绿版本，视觉上更偏向军绿色。三星产品虽然没有 Apple Watch 那般配件丰富，不过好在它采用了快拆表带，能够支持不少通用配件。直径 44mm 对我个人来说还是有点秀气了，Classic 46mm 版本倒是非常符合我的审美，但它除了配备物理旋转表圈以外，无论是性能还是续航都没有什么优势。唯一一点让我不满意的是，三星自家手机都属于窄边框领头羊，Watch4 又有何理由还在让边框停航母呢？
光照好的情况下会呈现军绿色
第一眼看上去，Watch4 非常薄，不过这只是在视觉讨巧罢了，三星利用表身最…</span>

数字人民币 App 上架，获支持在零售交易等场景试点

近日，数字人民币（试点版）App 正式在各大应用商店（包括 App Store 和国内 Android 应用商店）上线。数字人民币目前在深圳、苏州、雄安、成都、上海、海南、长沙、西安、青岛、大连及冬奥会场景（北京、张家口）开展试点，其他地区暂时无法注册。
截至目前，京东、美团、饿了么、天猫超市、滴滴出行等多家主流平台已接入数字人民币系统。
此外，1 月 6 日，国务院办公厅发布《关于印发要素市场化配置综合改革试点总体方案的通知》，其中提出「支持在零售交易、生活缴费、政务服务等场景试点使用数字人民币」。
此前在 2020 年，深圳、苏州等地曾向居民发送过数字人民币红包；数字人民币 App 曾开展过内测（可阅读本站作者的体验文章）。来源
国家版权局约谈数字音乐相关企业，要求终止独家音乐许可交易
1 月 6 日，国家版权局在京约谈主要唱片公司、词曲版权公司和数字音乐平台等，要求数字音乐产业各方协力维护数字音乐版权秩序，构建数字音乐版权良好生态。
约谈强调，各唱片公司、词曲版权公司、数字音乐平台应采取符合音乐传播规律、公平合理原则和国际惯例规则的授权模式，应通过保底金加实际使用量分成模式结算，除特殊情况外不得签署独家版权协议；完善内部版权管理制度，授权音乐作品应当曲库目录明确、版权权属清晰，维护音乐作品著作权人和相关权利人合法权益；优先通过协商、调解等方式解决数字音乐产业各方之间的版权纠纷；积极探索新场景、新业态音乐作品授权使用机制；建立符合市场需求的数字音乐版权运营模式。
在去年 7 月，市场监管总局曾责令腾讯控股有限公司解除网络音乐独家版权，并处以 50 万元的罚款。同年 8 月，腾讯发布声明，宣布已遵守相关规定进行调整，以非独家方式与上游版权方继续保持合作，并就非独家合作事宜与上游版权方进行协商。来源…</span>

                    <span>Deno is a modern JavaScript runtime, competing with Node.js, that promises features like secure I/O and built-in TypeScript support. Ryan Dahl, Node.js&#x27; original creator, created Deno, building it in Rust.

In Ryan Dahl&#x27;s talk Ten things I regret about Node, he talked about many problems with Node. This includes things like Node&#x27;s failure to embrace web standards, security, Node&#x27;s way of compiling native modules (GYP), and NPM. Then, he revealed Deno. Deno was a new project that fixed many of the problems Ryan Dahl had earlier mentioned, along with extra advantages like built-in TypeScript support. Ryan Dahl initially built Deno in Go but later switched to Rust.
Since Deno was first announced, it has made significant progress. 1.0 was released in August 2020, and companies like Slack have …</span>

                    <span>Call me crazy if you have to. You’d think that after five years of coding in one IDE, I would be out of my mind to leave the VS Code. And sure, before I tried out the JetBrains ecosystem, I would’ve completely agreed. I would’ve even offered up my left kidney, fighting for the fact that VS Code was superior (just like M1 Pro Macs are) to any other IDE on the market. Now just a bit of background, I work at Blankly where we enable people to build trading algorithms on hedge-fund level cloud infrastructure in minutes instead of months. During one of our daily stand-up meetings, my co-worker, Emerson, was adamant about the JetBrains ecosystem and extended the meeting trying to convince one of us to give it a whirl.

                    <span>Introduction


Having a style guide is a very useful way of having a clear and consistent form of writing that can be improved over time. This guide is mostly useful for technical writers. I&#x27;ll be sharing a few things I learned so far, writing for an open-source community (Fastify).
There are a few things you need to know and consider when writing your style guide.
Even though it is necessary to have a style guide, knowing why can help you figure what needs documenting. Speaking with your community members, developers, or a lead (Could be a program/project manager or a developer advocate if there is one), can help you identify your organisation needs.
Perhaps, you want a style guide for open-source community members who contribute to existing documentations or intended for developers who w…</span>

                    <span>In a world driven by software applications web applications took a lot more importance over the last years, every business wanted to have an access throw internet . Having a portal on the internet is very important for your business so web development held a-lot more value than ever.
Any web application contains of two main components ( Client - Server )
Client can be the interface that a user use to interact with your application, this client can be web that exists in the browsers like (chrome , safari , etc…)
All this applications need  server that provides the logic require to power this users interfaces with functionality. 
So if I want to be a good backend engineer in 2022 what should I learn ? In the end of the article I will give you suggestion to work with but let&#x27;s first discuss what backend server is ? 
to simplify the case backend is a code or program written in certain language that is hosted on a server that can be accessed through the internet and because the internet has no state (it will forget you and your data so this data should be stored on a disk not in the memory 
To restore a data on a disk and retrieve it through-code databases are used. 

So when you request a thing from a client you trigger some code that make certain logic and data can be stored in the database or retrieved from it then response is sent to client.

5.Back-end framework [nodeJS , GO , laravel].

So this was a simple friendly entry to the world of web development [backend] I tried to discuss the main idea in a simple way and in the next articles we will talk more in details about every component in the cycle of backend that can take you from rocky level to be an expert in the backend development .

                    <span>We made alwane.io a web-based tool giving you the ability to extract colors from a website URL or an existing CSS code, regroup/order colors, then generate a palette including a CSS/Sass file. A simple and handy tool to build your next project&#x27;s colors, get inspiration, and examine your website&#x27;s color palette.

It&#x27;s a simple web application to help you generate palettes for your projects. It uses a color sorting algorithm to gather colors from a website&#x27;s CSS or any other existing CSS code and regroup them into color classes. 
You can then order these colors, generate a CSS or SASS code, and start using it in your project. The tool also offers some other useful features: 
Colors can be extracted from an existing CSS code (the one used by the website) or from any other CSS code. 


Colors can be sorted and regrouped from a list of Hexadecimal codes.


Colors can be saved in sets: you can therefore create multiple lists of colors so that you can easily manage them. 


You have complete control of the pallet, where you can remove one color or a group of colors. 



I hope you like the tool. I’d be happy to answer any questions, and I welcome your feedback.</span>

                    <span>Today we will learn how to create our own Pipe or the Custom Pipe. If you are unaware about what a Pipe is in Angular then I would recommend you to go through the previous articles I wrote on Pipe. You can start from here
The need of custom pipe comes when the built in pipe does not meet our requirement.
✩ So now lets see how can we create our first Pipe ✩
The CLI command to create a Pipe is -
ng generate pipe 
the shorthand -
ng g p 
Lets open the command prompt in the project root and type in the below command -
ng g p custom-pipe-demo
custom-pipe-demo


One more line we can see in the command prompt which tells that the app.module.ts has been updated. 

So lets see how the pipe looks like -
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service.
It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. This chapter will give you an introduction to Spring Boot and familiarizes you with its basic concepts.
Spring Boot enables developers to build applications that are ready to use right away. By embedding a web server like as Tomcat or Netty into your program during the initialization phase, you may create independent applications that function without the need for an external web server.

                    <span>So you&#x27;ve written your Ethereum smart contract, and now you may be wondering how to deploy it. I recommend first deploying the contract to a Test Network (testnet), such as Rinkeby, before deploying it to Ethereum Main Network (mainnet). You can deploy to both testnet and mainnet by using the Remix web app.
Testnets behave similarly to the Ethereum Main Network, but the ETH required to transact with them is free to get from a &quot;faucet.&quot; Faucets are apps where you can input your testnet wallet address and receive testnet assets like ETH. (I like Chainlink&#x27;s Faucet and refer to it in the instructions below.) Testnet ETH enables you to pay the gas to deploy your smart contract to testnet and make test transactions.

As you probably know, the web browser, for the most part, is single-threaded, which means all the heavy lifting is done in a single thread, a.k.a the main thread.
That said, the web browser executes JavaScript code in the main thread, the same thread where parsing, layout, and paint happen.
This means if you have a large JavaScript file, the main thread will be busy evaluating your code before the user will be able to interact with the page.
She would have to wait, even though she won&#x27;t need every single functionality in that bundle right at the beginning.
So, a large JS file &#x3D; slower page load.

                    <span>三星 Tizen 应用商城已永久关闭

去年 6 月，三星公司关闭了 Tizen 应用商城的注册，并使商店只对现有用户开放，他们只能获得以前下载的应用程序。在 2021 年 12 月 31 日之后，Tizen 应用商店 永久关闭，不再对新用户和现有用户开放。最后一部运行 Tizen 的手机是三星在 2017 年发布的 Z4 手机。Tizen 公布于 2012 年 2 月，是英特尔 MeeGo 系统与三星 LiMo 系统的混合体。2016 年，Tizen 曾一度是全球第四大手机操作系统。由于三星电视全球巨大的出货量，Tizen 目前仍旧是 第一大电视操作系统。

TIOBE 宣布年度最佳编程语言是 Python

TIOBE 发布公告宣布了这一消息，该奖项被授予在一年内获得最高评级增长的编程语言。2021 年初，Python 从 TIOBE 指数的第 3 位开始，把 Java 和 C 都甩在身后，成为了 第一名。TIOBE 指数是基于一种编程语言在流行搜索引擎中的搜索结果数量的指数，并不表明最好或最有效率的编程语言，也不衡量整个互联网上用一种语言编写的代码量，并且不考虑非英语语言。


老王点评：这是一个趣味性排行榜，你不应该用这个来指导你学习哪种编程语言。




“快速内核头文件”项目 V2 进一步将构建速度提高了 88%

之前我们 报道过，“快速内核头文件” 项目会清理内核头文件依赖关系，大大加快 Linux 内核的构建速度。它可能会成为 2022 年最伟大的 Linux 内核功能之一。周末，该项目发布了 V2 版本，根据 Linux 5.16-rc8 上游状态进行了重构。值得注意的是，现在也支持用 LLVM Clang 编译器进行编译，这使得内核构建过程加快了 88%! 而之前使用 GCC 编译提升了 77%。


老王点评：积极关注这个项目，就是不知道内核社区对它的看法如何？毕竟牵涉太大了。</span>

                    <span>Audacity 是开源软件世界中的一个经典的强大工具，可以用于录音、编辑等对声音进行操作。




Audacity 声音编辑器是填补了一个似乎没有人意识到的空白的开源应用程序。它最初是在卡内基梅隆大学开发的，当时很多人还认为电脑只是用来办公和学习的，要进行严肃的多媒体工作需要特殊的 DSP 外围设备。Audacity 认识到，普通计算机用户偶尔也需要编辑音频。在此后的 20 年里，Audacity 团队一直为录音和清理声音打造这个开源的应用程序。

我经常使用 Audacity，作为一个受过培训的编辑，我已经习惯了在我的应用程序中使用重要的、通常是单键的键盘快捷键。通过围绕单个字母建立快捷键，你可以一只手放在鼠标上，一只手放在键盘上，所以选择一个工具或一个重要功能和点击鼠标之间的延迟仅仅是几毫秒而已。在本文中，我将专门给出我在 Audacity 中使用的键盘快捷方式，如果你想优化自己的设置可以参考。

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity

在大多数 Linux 发行版上，Audacity 都可以从你的软件包管理器中获得。在 Fedora、Mageia 和类似的发行版上：

$ sudo dnf install audacity


在 Elementary、Mint 和其他基于 Debian 的发行版上：

$ sudo apt install audacity


然而，我是以 Flatpak 方式来使用 Audacity 的。

在 Windows 或 macOS 上，可以从 Audacity 网站 下载一个 Audacity 安装程序。

它最近有一个叫做 Tenacity 的复刻版本，是另外的开发者团队准备延续 Audacity 的传统而开发的。在写这篇文章的时候，两者基本上是相同的应用程序，所以这篇文章同样适用于两者。以后是否…</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 大流行使一家联网温度计制造商 Kinsa 成为全国知名企业，因为它提供了一个可能了解疾病传播的窗口。




一家名为 Kinsa 的公司正在利用 物联网 技术来创建一个连接温度计的网络，收集大量的匿名健康数据，这些数据可以为了解当前和未来的流行病提供帮助。

该公司创始人兼首席执行官 Inder Singh 表示，能够近乎实时地跟踪美国各地的发烧水平，对于广大公众以及医疗保健部门和政府的决策者来说，都可能是一条至关重要的信息。

该系统的联网技术相对简单 —— 温度计通过蓝牙连接到用户手机上的一个应用程序，该应用程序通过互联网将匿名数据报告给 Kinsa 的云。Singh 强调说，该公司只整理到县一级的数据，并声称通过 Kinsa 的数据识别个人几乎是不可能的。

“我们不提供个人身份信息，我们不提供识别数据，”他说。“这款应用程序只会引导你找到你需要的护理和服务。”

有了体温读数和一些关于体温测量者的基本人口统计信息以及他们的其他症状，这款应用程序可以提供基本的指导，比如是否需要去看医生，以及用户所在的区域是否出现了异常的发烧程度。

然而，真正的价值在于 Kinsa 在其 美国健康天气地图 上分析和细分的聚合数据，这些数据是从该公司生态系统中的 100 多万个温度计收集而来的。根据 Singh 的说法，这个想法是为了给公众提供一种方式，让他们对自己的健康做出更明智的决定。

“这是一个参与性很强的活动，”他说。“每个人都能得到数据，每个人都能做出反应。”

Kinsa 仍然直接向消费者销售温度计，但该公司正计划与地方政府、卫生部门甚至学区进行更密切的合作——辛格说，Kinsa 已经与美国两个州（他拒绝透露其名称）以及包括佛罗里达州的圣奥古斯丁在内的多个市政府合作。

他说：“我们的希望是，我们能够找出如何建立一个可扩展的模型 —— 我们永远不会只靠卖 20 美元的温度计就可以在全球范围内扩展。”。我们的目标是使该产品能够广泛应用，从而成为医疗保健部门有意义的早期预警系统。

前言
现代的 Android 项目都是 Gradle 工程，所以大家都习惯于用 Gradle Module 来划分和组织代码，Module 的大量使用也带来一个问题，一个大项目往往几十上百的 Module，但是当数量众多的 Module 之间的依赖关系不合理时，仍然会严重拖慢工程的编译速度，如何更科学地组织 Gradle Module 是 Android 开发领域的普遍需求。
从事 Android 开发的同学可能都听说过 Clean Architecture，即所谓整洁架构。Google 推荐大家使用它对 MVVM 进行更合理的分层。整洁架构的概念出自以下这本书（国内译本：代码整洁之道），关于这本书以及作者 Bob 大叔的大名这里就不多介绍了，说这是软件架构方面的圣经也不为过。

除了优化 MVVM 这样的业务架构，这本书在组件设计方面也产出了不少最佳实践和方法论，可用来优化 Gradle 这样的工程架构。本文就来讨论如何基于整洁架构中的各种设计原则来设计我们的 Gradle Module。
文章目录如下：
Module 粒度划分

复用发布等价原则（REP）
共同封闭原则（CCP）
共同复用原则（CRP）
三原则的权衡
Module 依赖关系

无环依赖原则（ADP）
稳定依赖原则（SDP）

稳定度公式
稳定抽象原则（SAP）

抽象度公式
不稳定度与抽象度的关系

痛苦区与无用区
总结
Module 粒度划分
参考 Clean Architecture 中对组件的定义：
组件是软件的部署单元，是整个软件系统在部署过程中可以独立完成部署的最小实体。例如，对于 Java 来说，它的组件是 jar 文件。而在 Ruby 中，它们是 gem 文件。在 .Net 中，它们则是 DLL 文件。

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(0 min)</span>
                    <span>多态
多态是编程语言支持的一种特性，这种特性使得静态的代码运行时可能产生动态的行为，这样一来编程时不需要为类型所烦恼，可以编写统一的处理逻辑而不是依赖特定的类型。”
在星巴克消费的时候就会发生多态，多态方便了顾客。不管是现金，支付宝，亦或是微信，顾客不需要关心每种支付背后的细节，只需递交支付工具即可。服务员是产生多态行为的关键，他把同样的递交行为在结账机上动态地和不同的支付方式做了交接。
深入结账机内部，假设它使用如下方式实现支付的多态：
class PayManager {
    fun pay(type: String){
        if (type &#x3D;&#x3D; 现金){
            payByCash()
        } else if (type &#x3D;&#x3D; 支付宝) {
            payByAli()
        } else if (type &#x3D;&#x3D; 微信) {
            payByWechat()
        }
    }
}

通过 if-else 实现，其实称不上多态，而且这样实现会遇到不少麻烦。
if-else 之殇：无扩展性
新增支付方式时，得重新生产结账机。
因为if-else是在编译时新增行为，即当代码编译完成后，就生成了一张PayManager.pay()的 PDF 快照，它无法在运行时动态地改变，要新增行为就得重新编译，所以这种新增行为是静态的，无扩展性可言。
与 编译时新增行为 对应的是运行时新增行为，即当运行不同的上层代码，PayManager.pay()会表现出不同的行为（多态）。
策略模式就适用于当前场景，策略模式将具体的行为和行为的使用者隔离，当行为发生变化时，行为的使用者不需要随之而变。
// 用接口定义抽象支付行为
interface Pay {
    fun pay()
}

前言
了解过Compose的同学都知道，只需要添加一个@Compose注解就可以将函数转化成Compose函数，同时Compose函数也只能在Compose函数中运行。这看起来似乎跟协程比较像，@Compose是不是也像协程一样，往函数中添加了一些参数呢？
我们就一起来看下，@Compose到底做了什么，又是怎么做到的。
前置知识
一看到@Compose注解，我们很容易就想到注解处理器，但是@Compose的解析并不是通过注解处理器来实现的，因为注解处理器只能生成代码，不能修改代码
KCP（Kotlin Compiler Plugin）：即kotlin编译插件，支持跨平台，android开发可以将它类比为kapt+transform机制，既可以生成代码，也可以修改代码
@Compose注解的解析就是通过KCP来实现的
什么是KCP
Kotlin编译过程简单来说，就是将Kotlin源码编译成字节码的过程，具体步骤如下所示：

而Kotlin编译期插件则在编译过程中提供Hook时机，让我们可以解析符号，修改字节码生成结果等。
Kotlin库中的不少语法糖都用到了KCP，比如Kotlin-android-extension，@Parcelize等，@Compose注解同样也是通过KCP解析的
相比KAPT，KCP主要有以下优点：
KAPT是基于注解处理器的，它需要将Kotlin代码转化成Stub再解析注解生成代码，常常转化成Stub的时间比生成代码还要长，而KCP则是直接解析Kotlin的符号，因此在编译速度上KCP比KAPT要强的多
KAPT只能生成代码，不能修改代码，而KCP不仅可以生成代码，也可以修改代码，可以看作是kapt+transorm机制
而KCP的缺点则在于，KCP 的开发成本太高，涉及 …</span>

                    <span>引子：这一次，咱们来聊聊摩托车
首先，作为少数派 Matrix 社区的新人作者，在新的一年里，向大家问好。
关注少数派很长时间了，有幸能看到这么多优秀的人和优秀的文章，也许是由于少数派是以科技和效率为主的网站，尽管在分享「生活方式」的文章中，有关「摩托」的话题也不是很多。（当然除了摩托罗拉），所以在这里我想和各位少数派的朋友分享一下「我为什么骑摩托车」。
不得不说，确实是刘德华主演的电影《烈火战车》给我埋下了摩托车的种子，但是在家人眼中，摩托车常常与「危险、浮躁、不正经」等贬义词挂钩。好在我从没提过想骑摩托车，所以也免去了在购买前和家人辩论的过程。
《烈火战车》剧照，图片来自豆瓣
随着近几年短视频的兴起，机车文化得到了一定的传播和发展，并且得益于各地「禁摩令」不同程度地取消，摩托车也成为了越来越多人的出行和生活方式，如果你也有兴趣入坑机车，那本文会有我的一些建议可供参考，另外为了提升易读性，本文不涉及动力、扭矩等参数。推荐入坑前可以关注「哈罗摩托」、「骑士网」等相关网站获取更专业的信息。如果有问题也可以直接在评论或私信中向我提问。
从复古车型到入手爱车
尽管很多摩友入坑的多数目的是追求速度与激情，但是我一直认为速度附带的刺激程度和危险系数是同等的，刺激和危险并不能形成对冲关系，所以在选购方面，我第一时间排除了仿赛车型（偏速度），只留意复古车型。

                    <span>时间如飞般流逝，我们挥别2021，迎来了2022，又到了一年回首的时刻。回顾过去，记录文字，不仅能让我汲取力量，更好地应对现在与未来，它也是一种我试图与消逝的时间相抗衡的方式，想要留下一些更久远隽永的东西。
回首2021，我所践行的生活信条用一个词形容，大概是「平衡」，这篇文章我将谈谈我的平衡生活方式理念、打造方法与各方面的收获感悟。文章较长，大家如果无法阅读完全文，可以大概扫一下各级标题和加粗文字，希望能够给你启发与共鸣。

为什么选择平衡
选择 平衡 or 极致，是一个价值观取向的问题，毕竟，life is all about trade-off，人生是一个取舍的过程。而就我个人而言，我不喜欢「all or nothing」的价值观，我更相信平衡才能走得更远。
极度的专注于某事确实能让人获得“专注红利”，可能给我们带来更高的回报，但另一方面，它也可能导致“管窥”心态，产生“隧道视野”，我们的视野变窄，那些存在于“管子”视野之外的事物被抑制了，其他重要但不紧急的事就会被我们搁置，譬如专注于工作而忽视身体与家人，等出现意外状况才发现得不偿失，在我看来，这样的生活方式是不具备反脆弱性的，就像投资，all in 押注于某一个标的，可能暴富也可能承受毁灭性打击。
我所理解的平衡生活
那平衡就是生活各个方面平均分配时间精力吗？并不是这样。我所理解的平衡生活，不是平均分配，而是把人生的各个重要方面拉入我们的视野，构成我们的日常生活，分配的比重可以根据我们的偏好与状态决定。虽然分配比例不一，但每一项都有一个最低限度需要达到，实际上在一些事务上我们只要坚持投入小的时间精力就能有不错的改善（帕累托法则），可以避免出现过度倾斜与失衡。
哪些是生活的重要方面？每个人的定义与分类都不同，以我自己为例。我在《一份个人复盘指南——成为更好的自己》中提到过一个生命之花模型，将生活分为了8个板块：

                    <span>这个真实的世界从来不是一个摆拍摄影棚，日常拍照的时候总会有些不如人意的元素「乱入」，比如脸上冒出的一颗痘、洁白墙上沾染的一块污渍、那些避之不及避无可避的人流…… 你或许可以通过调整角度、放大裁剪，以及耗时耗力的等待来拍摄一个相对完美的画面，那有没有更便捷的解决方式呢？「图片修复」是其中一个答案。
我最早接触此类功能，还是在 2014 年桌面端 Photoshop 中的「内容识别填充」，时至今日这依然是 Photoshop 中我使用频率最高的功能之一。而近几年在移动端，这一功能也非常成熟了，比如今天介绍的这款 TouchRetouch，就是一款专注于图片修复的应用。
TouchRetouch 可以通过算法，巧妙地将图片上你觉得碍眼的元素遮盖掉。近期推出的 5.0 版本，除了继续提升颜值外，还在操作细致度和修复智能性上作出进一步优化。如果说以前各类综合性修图软件的「修复」功能正在逐步赶上 TouchRetouch，那这次更新它又狠狠地将同行「甩在身后」。
UI 变化
TouchRetouch 5.0 外观的变化，主要集中在深浅配色和选择照片页两个地方。自从 iOS 13 设置深色模式以来，深浅双色主题已经成为许多应用的标配，TouchRetouch 算是姗姗来迟的那位。你可以在「设置 - 外观」调整主题，以及不同配色的图标。如果你对 5.0 回归拟物化的图片不太满意，就可以在这里换回之前的版本。
由于 TouchRetouch 此前一直为深色主题，所以双色主题的加入主要在于提升颜值和与系统的契合程度。而选图界面的变化，则更偏向功能性了。新版的选图界面支持 3 种不同的预览模式，点击左下角的切换按钮会在正方形和原始比例两种预览模式下切换，如果你在某一素材上使用双指打开手势还可以切换为大图预览模式。正方形预览是大多修图应用默认的拣选模式，整齐划一、突出中心元素又充分利用屏幕空间，可…</span>

是个人就有说话的需求。除了说「有用」的话之外，人们也需要说废话。微博是个用来向朋友乃至整个互联网喋喋不休倾倒废话的平台，但人们有时会发现，有些废话实在太废了，废到自己都不好意思让别人看到，这就催生了微博——以及朋友圈、豆瓣广播等——种种「某某可见」的废话权限管理体系。
然而这依旧不够。对包括我在内的大部分人来说，朋友圈和微博始终是个「对外开放」的窗口——无论隐私状态是「仅自己可见」还是「所有人可见」，只要进入这些平台，你就感觉自己光着屁股来到了沙滩上，哪怕披着隐形衣，熙熙攘攘的围观群众依旧在对你施加压力。这样一种「有人看着呢」的心理暗示，使得你无论如何也没法放飞自我，畅所欲言。
那么，哪里有专供人说废话的「私人微博」，只包含一个朋友的「朋友圈」，乃至没有任何人际互动的「广播」呢？
我开始感到这种需求，是因为用了一段时间的 flomo。虽然最终也没输出啥成果，但那种随时随地、想说就说的体验，委实让我欲罢不能。这种欲罢不能并非来自什么「知识的复利」——而是单纯的畅所欲言、释放自己话痨本性的快感。
然而 flomo 是付费产品（虽然免费也可用），而且数据在自家的服务器（而非本地或自己的云盘）上，至少对我来说，总归有点不安稳。我于是开始寻找更好的选择。
「私人微博」的标准
在试用和评价之前，我们先要搞清楚一点：我们想要的到底是什么？「私人微博」应用具备怎样的功能属性？在厘清我们的需求以及满足这种需求的功能之后，我们才能开始一种有的放矢的评估。
我想，既然名叫「微博」，轻量化必然是这些产品的首要属性，最好是能做到打开就写，关闭即存。我就因此…</span>

                    <span>TLDR: This tutorial explains how to add search functionality to your Hugo Website
After writing multiple blog posts, I quickly realized that more pages meant more clutter. If someone wants to find a post, they&#x27;d have to manually search for it by digging through each page. Imagine if I have 10 pages, with 6 blog posts per page. Finding an article would be difficult and a bad user experience. Adding a search bar, as well as tag filters, would fix this issue, so I did some research on how to implement this for my website.
I&#x27;m using Hugo as my static site generator and the documentation isn&#x27;t the best. Their docs show multiple options for implementing search, but their explanations are pretty bad. Some options include: using native Javascript, Elasticsearch, lunr.js, etc. But I went with a thi…</span>

                    <span>In this tutorial, we will learn how to authenticate users, secure endpoints and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in NodeJs.
You&#x27;ll need the following to follow along with this tutorial: 
A working grasp of JavaScript.
A good understanding of Node.js.
A working knowledge of MongoDB or another database of your choice.
Postman and a basic understanding of how to utilize it.
Security uses authentication and authorization, especially when gaining access to a system. But there&#x27;s a big difference between getting into a house (authentication) and what you can do once you&#x27;re there (authorization).
Authentication is the process of confirming a user&#x27;s identity by obtaining credentials and utilizing those credentials to validate the user&#x27;s identity. If the certificates are valid, the authorization…</span>

                    <span>In this small tutorial, we&#x27;ll take a closer look at using Gorilla WebSocket to write our own websocket server, at a more functional level than the basic example and easier to understand than the chat example.
What will our server be able to do?
Send new messages from clients to callback
Keep active connections and close / delete inactive
Send messages to active connections
First, we use the standard http help server net/http so that we can catch connection requests:
package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;html&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, echo)

}

func echo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, &quot;Hello, %q&quot;, html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
}

                    <span>Introduction


In order to build a professional web application, optimization and performance are two important things you need to care about.
There are many tips and techniques used to increase the performance of a web application, such as Debouncing and Throttling.
When it comes to debouncing and throttling, developers often confuse.
During this blog, I will go throw these two techniques in details using react.js, but it is the same principle for vanilla JavaScript or any other JavaScript framework.  
Before dive deep into debouncing, let&#x27;s see a simple and normal example that implement a search box that allows users to search something without clicking any button.
function App() {

  const handleChange &#x3D; e &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>Happy new year! We start this year with an epic showdown. Today, we&#x27;ll teach a computer to play Tic-tac-toe with us by looking at different approaches from a dumbed down version of everything to a highly sophisticated AI. I&#x27;ll play five rounds of 50 games each against the computer and see who&#x27;s the ultimate Tic-tac-toe champion!
Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!
Most people have played Tic-tac-toe, or Noughts and crosses (is there a trademark? I don&#x27;t know, hopefully not), at least once in their life. It&#x27;s played by two players on a 3 by 3 grid. The goal is to get 3 of your own symbols (either O or X, hence &quot;Noughts and crosses&quot;) either on the diagonals, a row or a column. The turn-based game starts out with an empty board where the first player can set their symbol (usually X) on any cell they l…</span>

But before that, we need to know the difference between compilation and Interpretation.
The entire Source code is converted into machine code at once and written to a binary file 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s which can be executed later processor.

The Source Code gets Complied and covert the portable file (machine code) and then its portable files get executed and we are now able to run the program.


It&#x27;s a 2 step process 1. compilation and 2. Execution.


Always remember the execution would take place after compilation only.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been a software developer for over 8 years. I feel very confident and comfortable in Javascript ecosystems, especially ReactJS. But I&#x27;ve also worked in many more frameworks and languages, including Python, Ruby on Rails, C++, C#, PHP, WordPress, and straight up HTML and CSS. I&#x27;ve deployed and administrated servers using Heroku, Digital Ocean, and AWS. I&#x27;ve created and maintained loads of websites over the years.
However in many ways I feel I&#x27;m just scratching the surface. The more I learn about software, the more I learn there is to learn.

                    <span>Metrics surround us. Whether you&#x27;re building the next big thing and need to measure customer churn, retention rates, etc. you will always need numbers to really back it up. This is the same when we are building trading strategies. We need easy and straightforward ways of analyzing whether or not our model is actually doing well. Now before we go into understanding various portfolio metrics, we have to first really understand the point of having good metrics. And for that, we have to understand what it means for a model to &quot;do well&quot;.
For some of you readers out there, you probably already know what you want out of a strategy and what metrics you may want to do. For that, feel free to skip ahead to the various metrics and their implementations.

                    <span>Hey, this is Mohammad Hassani 😃
if you are developing with Linux and wanna import database to docker with terminal you can use this tutorial...
first of all you should copy your .sql file to var/lib/docker/volumes/blog_blogmysql/_data
in terminal:
cp DATABASE.sql var/lib/docker/volumes/blog_blogmysql/_data

// Replace DATABASE to your database file name
now your database is ready to import, in this step execute docker in terminal,
dockstation for Linux, they are similar. and then you can execute there)
also in terminal:
docker exec -it CONTAINERNAME bash

// Replace CONTAINERNAME to your container name like site_mysql_1
now open mysql in terminal:
mysql -uroot -p DATABASENAME

if you dont have database in container you can use




mysql -uroot -p

and then:
CREATE DATABASE DATABASENAME;

// Replace DATABASENAME to your database name
ok! everything is set now and ready to go...
source var/lib/mysql/DATABASE.sql

it maybe take some time depends on your .sql file size and your computer.
you can use this code instead of step 3 and 4:




mysql --init-command&#x3D;&quot;set autocommit&#x3D;0&quot; DATABASENAME &lt; var/lib/mysql/DATABASE.sql

that&#x27;s it!
if you have another way, leave a message :)
Be happy! ;)</span>

                    <span>英国的植物出口 IT 系统只适用于旧版本的 IE 浏览器

英国政府部门要求，将植物和种子等产品从英国运往欧盟必须使用它们的 IT 系统来提前登记。但是，该系统 只能在 IE 浏览器 上正常工作，即使你使用最新的，还在支持期的 IE 11，你也必须在向后兼容模式下运行，因为该网站是 2000 年建设的。据统计，2021 年 12 月，IE 在全球的使用份额仅为 0.46%。IE 11 将于今年 6 月 15 日停止支持。


老王点评：看到国外政府部门也是这样，我就放心了。




Canonical 正在重构 Snap 应用

相比传统 Linux 安装包，Snap 更具可移植性，但它也有很多问题。除了这种容器式软件包固有的体积大、加载慢等缺陷，Snap 还不支持自定义软件库，必须通过 Canonical 的 Snap 商店分发。Linux Mint 就完全阻止了 Snap 应用程序的安装，并和其他一些发行版支持 RedHat 发明的 Flatpak 软件包。Canonical 正在计划 把 Snapcraft 拆成更小、更模块化和可重复使用的组件，以在一系列不同的产品中利用。软件包构建者可以使用通用的部件，并将添加的 Snapcraft 功能作为一个单独的层使用。


老王点评：我还以为 Canonical 会放弃 Snap，转向 Flatpak 呢。




Fedora 36 考虑放弃对 ifcfg 脚本的支持

虽然修改 ifcfg 脚本来管理网络连接已经基本上成为过去，NetworkManager 和类似的软件现在对大多数用户来说都很好用。NetworkManager 保留了对 ifcfg 脚本的支持，但如何处理这些文件是个麻烦，维护这种支持是个负担。ifcfg 脚本的设计没有前瞻性，导致了巨大的复杂性，而且其支持代码多达 13 万行，这还不包括巨大的测试套件，一直是各种错误的来源。因此，Fedora 36 考虑放弃 对这些脚本的支持。


老王点评：虽然这是一件好事，但是不可避免的，越来越多的老旧的、遵循古典 UNIX 哲学的东西会慢慢淘汰，这是 UNIX 哲学的没落么？</span>

                    <span>这篇文章讨论了安装 NumPy，然后创建、读取和排序 NumPy 数组。




NumPy（即 Numerical Python）是一个库，它使得在 Python 中对线性数列和矩阵进行统计和集合操作变得容易。我在 Python 数据类型的笔记中介绍过，它比 Python 的列表快几个数量级。NumPy 在数据分析和科学计算中使用得相当频繁。

我将介绍安装 NumPy，然后创建、读取和排序 NumPy 数组。NumPy 数组也被称为 ndarray，即 N 维数组的缩写。

安装 NumPy

使用 pip 安装 NumPy 包非常简单，可以像安装其他软件包一样进行安装：

pip install numpy


安装了 NumPy 包后，只需将其导入你的 Python 文件中：

import numpy as np


将 numpy 以 np 之名导入是一个标准的惯例，但你可以不使用 np，而是使用你想要的任何其他别名。

为什么使用 NumPy? 因为它比 Python 列表要快好几个数量级

当涉及到处理大量的数值时，NumPy 比普通的 Python 列表快几个数量级。为了看看它到底有多快，我首先测量在普通 Python 列表上进行 min() 和 max() 操作的时间。

我将首先创建一个具有 999,999,999 项的 Python 列表：

&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list &#x3D; range(1, 1000000000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(my_list)
999999999


现在我将测量在这个列表中找到最小值的时间：

&gt;&gt;&gt; start &#x3D; time.time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(my_list)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#x27;Time elapsed in milliseconds: &#x27; + str((tim…</span>

                    <span>在 Linux 或 BSD 操作系统上设置基本的实时流媒体服务器。




实时视频流越来越流行。亚马逊的 Twitch 和谷歌的 YouTube 等平台拥有数百万用户，这些用户消磨了无数小时的来观看直播和录制视频。这些视频服务通常可以免费使用，但需要你拥有一个帐户，并且一般会将你的视频内容隐藏在广告中。有些人不希望他们的视频提供给大众观看，或者想更多地控制自己的视频内容。幸运的是，借助强大的开源软件，任何人都可以设置直播服务器。

入门

在本教程中，我将说明如何使用 Linux 或 BSD 操作系统设置基本的实时流媒体服务器。

搭建实时流媒体服务器不可避免地提到系统需求问题。这些需求多种多样，因为实时流媒体涉及许多因素，例如：


流媒体质量： 你想以高清流媒体播放还是标清视频就可以满足你的需求？

收视率： 你的视频预计有多少观众？

存储： 你是否打算保留已保存的视频流副本？

访问： 你的视频流是私有的还是向全世界开放的？


在硬件要求方面没有固定规则，因此我建议你进行测试，以便找到最适合你需求的配置。本项目中，我将服务器安装在配有 4GB 内存、20GB 硬盘空间和单个 Intel i7 处理器内核的虚拟机上。

本项目使用实时消息传递协议Real-Time Messaging Protocol（RTMP）来处理音频和视频流。当然还有其他协议可用，但我选择 RTMP 是因为它具有广泛的支持。鉴于像 WebRTC 这样的开放标准变得更加兼容，我比较推荐这条路线。

同样重要的是，要明白“实时”并不总是意味着即时。视频流必须经过编码、传输、缓冲和显示，这通常会增大延迟。延迟可以被缩短或延长，具体取决于你创建的流类型及其属性。

设置 Linux 服务器

你可以使用许多不同的 Linux 发行版，但我更喜欢 Ubuntu，因此我…</span>

PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛
起因
新年要来了，看电影是我们新年中必不可少的娱乐项目，那么看电影的时候你是否有想过选座位的空间是如何实现的呢，今天就带你研究。
compose的绘制系列在两个月前就已经学习完成了，但是仅限于api的熟练，因此今天打算做一个仿淘票票选电影座位的自定义ui。
效果查看
先看一下支付宝客户端的实现吧

我们发现选座位的主要点就是座位的绘制、选择座位的逻辑、双指手势缩放、单指长按后拖动效果
既然说到这里了提取吧我们实现的效果也放出来吧：

实现要点
绘制座位
本身绘制座位我么可以使用drawRoundRect api来实现，不过为了增加难度本例中我是使用path拼接而成的座位。这样做的目标也是为了方便将来将座位扩展成其它形状
构建path的代码：
val path &#x3D; Path().apply {
        moveTo(boundStart.x, boundStart.y + radius)
        addArc(//绘制圆弧
            Rect(Offset(boundStart.x + radius, boundStart.y + radius), radius),
            180f,
            90f,
        )
        lineTo(boundEnd.x - radius, boundStart.y)
        arcTo(
            Rect(Offset(boundEnd.x - radius, boundStart.y + radius), radius),
            270f,
            90f,
            false
        )
        lineTo(boundEnd.x, boundEnd.y - radius)
        arcTo(Rect(Offset(boundEnd.x - radius, boundEnd.y - radius), radius), 0f, 90f, false)
        lineTo(boundStart.x + radius, boundEnd.y)
        arcTo(Rect(Offset(boundStart.x + radius, boundEnd.y - radius), radius), 90f, 90f, false)
        close()
    }

drawpath：
drawPath(
        path,
        if (seat.type &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) Color(0xfff4d9bd) else Color(0xffc3d9e9),
        style &#x3D; Stroke(strokeWidth)//使用Stroke可以保证我们的path绘制出来是线妆的效果
    )

双指操作手势
手势的使用可以参考之前我写过的文章，传送门
使用双指手势需要使用如下两个Modifier操作符：
.graphicsLayer
.transformable(state &#x3D; state)

实现代码如下：
 var scale by remember { mutableStateOf(1f) }
    var offset by remember { mutableStateOf(Offset.Zero) }
    val state &#x3D; rememberTransformableState { zoomChange, offsetChange, rotationChange -&gt;
        scale *&#x3D; zoomChange
        offset +&#x3D; offsetChange
    }
    Box(
        Modifier
            .fillMaxSize(),

        contentAlignment &#x3D; Alignment.Center
    ) {
       内容部分
       ....
    }

一. Android渲染知识
1.1 绘制原理
Android系统要求每一帧都要在 16ms 内绘制完成，平滑的完成一帧意味着任何特殊的帧需要执行所有的渲染代码（包括 framework 发送给 GPU 和 CPU 绘制到缓冲区的命令）都要在 16ms 内完成，保持流畅的体验。这个速度允许系统在动画和输入事件的过程中以约 60 帧每秒（ 1秒 / 0.016帧每秒 &#x3D; 62.5帧/秒 ）的平滑帧率来渲染。

如果你的应用没有在 16ms 内完成这一帧的绘制，假设你花了 24ms 来绘制这一帧，那么就会出现掉帧的情况。

系统准备将新的一帧绘制到屏幕上，但是这一帧并没有准备好，所有就不会有绘制操作，画面也就不会刷新。反馈到用户身上，就是用户盯着同一张图看了 32ms 而不是 16ms ，也就是说掉帧发生了。
1.2 掉帧
掉帧是用户体验中一个非常核心的问题。丢弃了当前帧，并且之后不能够延续之前的帧率，这种不连续的间隔会容易会引起用户的注意，也就是我们常说的卡顿、不流畅。引起掉帧的原因非常多，比如：
花了非常多时间重新绘制…</span>

前言
这次更新进度时间间隔有点长，主要原因呢，找可用的API数据源，这玩意竟然占了耗时大头……最终效果还未知，到时候再说吧……另外，由于阅读器模块的基本结束，所以开发方向转向整体APP开发，所以设计搭建框架，选择合适的辅助工具，思考该做成什么样子，也占用了一定时间；
当然以上不是为了给天天摸🐟 找借口，你们要信我啊；
回正题，在APP设计上，我想在首页上仿Soul的那个星球效果来做个推荐页面，这次就来实践一下
设计
首先呢，搜了下 github 好像并没有相关的Flutter控件可以直接拿来用，不过如果放宽到 Android 上面，倒是有一大批，那么这块实现方案也不用自己设计了，直接照抄就完事了；
不过抄的过程中，发现这玩意好像也没那么好抄～～抄这玩意的第一件事，是翻出曾经的数学课本，预习一下向量和空间坐标这部分的东西；
不过所幸，核心原理其实不复杂，用一句话就能说明：
全程围绕 罗德里格旋转矢量公式 来搞，通过更新向量、旋转角度，并带进公式中，就能实现需要的效果；
实现与踩坑
实现部分：
在实现方式上：使用的是 Stack 做主体，结合 Transform 来处理位移、缩放、透明度等部分；其build方法就这样：

在 initState 的时候初始化AnimationController，通过设置监听器的方式调用 setState 来更新UI：

计算逻辑就是用那个公式来搞就完事了：

一些小坑
虽然上面说的挺轻松的样子，但是其中还是遇到了一些小坑需要处理：
由于引入了Z轴的概念，所以正如第一张图中注释说的那样，要根据Z轴重新排个序，来正确处理点击事件等部分；

手势竞争这块还有个小问题，由于最外层是一个TabBarView，所以是可以左右滑动的，而星球本身是可以任意方向拖动的，由此带来了一个横向的手势冲突问题：
这个问题的解决方法有很多，不过我使用的是修改Pan手势竞争器判断阈值的方式来做的处理，用这种做法的人应该比较少吧：

结语
现在来看下效果：

好像debug模式下在30fps左右，虽说及格线吧，但是明显手动拖动的时候好很多，可能也是20张图片+transform有点多？也有可能图片这块可以做下优化？后续看看profile模式下的表现，分析下表现耗时再看看；
这次看看标题写的装逼点，效果咋样，不过可没做标题党，说300行就300行，没有故意压缩行数，用的AS的通用代码模版，甚至到最后还有一点空余：</span>

                    <span>这个系列的文章，是笔者和朋友在30天自驾环游中国西线时候所发生的故事。希望你能从我们的故事中获得一些有用的信息。也希望这些旅途中的见闻和思考能带动各位观众和读者能够自己去探索自己旅途中的故事。
本期我们主要讲述一下，解决完矛盾之后我们前往广西的所见所闻，本篇我们讲述的时间线是2021年1月15日-1月16日，承接上一个篇章，即我们在渡轮上发生矛盾之后的事情。由于我们也知道当天是没有办法在拍摄到日出了，所以我们就直接不去桂林了，而是直接前往了阳朔西街，在阳朔西街逗留了片刻，然后去相公山住宿，第二天拍摄一下相公山的山水景色。在本篇中，你将会获取一些我们在阳朔西街和相公山两个地方的一些信息，虽然会有些碎片化，但是还是正在阅读的你们能够获取到一些有用的信息，在未来能够应用到自己的旅行中去。
本系列在B站上也做了视频，如果大家喜欢影音接收信息的话，可以移步到B站观看我们的视频栏目，如果你是偏好文字的读者，在这里你也可以获取我们的节目内容，这里也可以看成是对视频做的一种笔记。

本文采取核心内容+感性叙述的方式来展现，文章的前半部分主要分享核心的信息点给大家，文章的后半部分主要从我个人的视角来叙述内容和过程，感性部分比较多。大家可以根据自己的阅读偏好，来选择阅读到哪里。
当日计划
2021年1月15日，我们从徐闻港的渡轮下来之后，已经是当天的12点半，准备好出发已经将近一点钟。得益于上一期矛盾的解决，我和“不可”在那之后的行动方案非常统一。于是我们商量好，当天15号的任务是，放弃桂林的日落，直接去阳朔西街看看，毕竟已经来不及赶到桂林了。在完成阳朔西街的游历后，当天晚上直接去到相公山住下，第二天爬山，然后拍一些山水风景的画面。
“不可”也表示同意，服从安排。于是我们当…</span>

钱浩：《是什么让我们难以领略音乐的艺术》

音乐是我们生活中不可或缺的事物，但是人们对于音乐的理解总是欠缺的。这种缺憾在于我们对音乐的认知与了解实在有限。对于音乐的各类术语——调性、节奏、曲式等，我们实在很难说出一二三来，这就使得我们在很多情况下无法辨别音乐的“好坏”。我记得Mr.Miss的杜凯在节目结束之后，曾说自己受到很大打击：自己认为最好的作品反向平平（《你怎么不上天呢》），但自己无奈加入专辑中的糊口作品却受到观众的喜爱（秋别）。而钱浩在书中给读者给出了一个问题的答案，就是我们如何学习欣赏音乐的作品，尤其是更为复杂的音乐作品。
在我看来，作者最有价值的地方在于点出了我们欣赏范式的陈旧，以及我们对于旋律的执着。书中举的例子主要是古典乐。为何古典乐的门槛高？在某种程度上，它的艺术创作动机是非自然的，所以需要一定的练习才能欣赏。一如，我们需要学习才能理解人类的某个方向上的钻研与突破。作者在书中强烈推荐读者一定要学习“和声学”，而我也在这种“学习”的思路下，买了后浪出版的大部头——[美] 罗杰·凯密恩的《听音乐》。
其实，在十多年前，当年的好朋友曾送给我一本《All of Music》（好像是这一本），但是我却一直未曾读过，惭愧惭愧。
刘勃：《司马迁的记忆之野》《失败者的春秋》

刘勃的历史文化随笔，非常接地气，同时又非常具有现代性。从阅读的友好度来说，刘勃的作品算是十分不错的科普读物。去年读了这个系列写作中的两本，阅读体验都非常好。在读库的作者群中，刘勃的作品总给人带来一些惊喜。作为一个历史作家，刘勃作品中的文学性是专业研究者在面向大众写作时需要学习的部分。一如在2021年过世的史景迁，以一种非虚构的文学性的创作手法，来展现自己的历史研究。
有关历史的作品，总是会吸引我们读下去的。大家的“吃瓜”心理不仅会投射在现代人物上，也会投射在历史人物身上，从两千年前到现在，…</span>

从日本综艺的小窗口 wipe 演出，到各路吃播、热剧、综艺、舞台，甚至当你点进一个直播间，主播都有可能正在看别的主播直播，再附加自己的点评......这种双视窗画面的视频对当下的我们来说并不陌生。在此文中，我们将其称为反应类视频（Reaction video）。
本文将反应类视频的生产与观众的互动当作一类互联网文化实验，试图分析上传者的诉求，以及在“Watching People Watching People Watching”链条背后的受众心态。
一个关于蛋炒饭的 Reaction 视频，怎么就引发了全网议论？
似乎很难想到，一碗蛋炒饭也能够成为学术研究的对象。在刚刚过去的11月，武汉大学媒体发展研究中心推送了国内跨文化传播学者的一篇研究论文，在其中，对炒饭教程的 reaction 视频被比喻成为“参与式狂欢”的样本，助推了一起典型跨文化事件在舆论场上的发酵与热议。
一顿香喷喷的蛋炒饭，怎么就激发了东西文化差异的争论？先让我们将时钟拨回两年前，缕情事情的来由。
故事最初发生在2019年4月，当时 BBC Food 频道在 Facebook 上发布了一条4分钟的炒饭视频。视频中，印度美食博主 Hersha Patel 展示着从煮饭到滤水，再到炒饭出锅的全过程，起初并没有受到太多讨论。
而在一年多之后，一名马来西亚华裔喜剧演员 Nigel Ng 在自己的 Youtube 上发布了一则 Reaction 视频，直指原视频里的做法“不正宗”，完全是“老外蛋炒饭”。在视频里，他坐在桌子前，与电脑中的视频画面同步做出各种或惊讶或“槽多无口”的表情。
例如，在最初加水的环节，观众就能感受到博主小哥的“暴躁”：他一边紧盯着自己的手指，一边说“为什么用英国茶杯量水？要用手指量啊！”

当看到美食博主用滤网沥米饭的时候，Ng 的…</span>

                    <span>写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢“用产品思维解构生活”的，花生酱。你也可以叫我Jeff。
2022年的我，是一枚7岁的产品经理，也是一个公众号的主理人，同时还是一名效率产品领域的作家。我曾对信息获取、方法论总结如痴如狂，却从未对“获得信息”感到满足。
截止到去年，我已经读了产品领域90%的书籍，订阅了500+公众号及付费阅读产品，并且还在持续每周花50小时在电子设备上摄取内容。但我仍然觉得空虚，焦虑，以及，不满足。
海量的信息在我脑海飘过，我害怕错失任何一点点“有用”的部分，试图抓住全部，却几乎遗忘了全部。
但最近半年，我好多了。
我重新审视了自己的工具、方法，以及自己对信息的期待、和信息的关系，进而找到了一些蛛丝马迹，并进一步对自己的“效率生活”进行了重构，终于和“信息处理”步入了近乎“握手言和”的阶段。
所以，这篇文章，想讲讲这一路的心得，供君参考。
从“刚下飞机”聊起
不记得什么时候开始，“刚下飞机”，已经成为了一个经典的时间点。
这种叙事来自于：“万物互联”和“移动化”这两件事，已经把我们的生活搬到了飞速向前的生产线滑轨上。而“飞机上”这个断网的环境，或许是现阶段共识的、唯一可以打破这种互联的场景。所以“刚下飞机”这样的表述，多多少少表现出，我们对“飞速向前和海量信息”的应对方式（至少我），是略显被动和僵硬的。
信息太多，没有办法专心。概念太多，没有办法熟悉。更多的情况下，我们被“无限降低的注意力门槛”拖着走，看着最热内容里面一个个光鲜的“头部案例”，感觉自己知晓了一切，而自己的生活却仍是马太效应中的长尾典型。
信息从脑海中穿堂而过，不留丝毫停歇。而人本身，更像是一个站在白雾茫茫中，吹着四面八方来风的旗子，四处飘扬，等于没在飘扬。
本能的反应是，我们要追逐效率。只要处理得够快，信息就追不上我们。
我们试图用工具和方法论，让自己快速清理掉这些信息。比如试图用“5秒的短视频”…</span>

                    <span>自从Struggle with Me开始关注记笔记这个话题， 我们经常收到朋友们关于如何记笔记的问题。粗略概括一下，这些问题大概分为三类：

我也试过记笔记，但是对我没什么帮助。记笔记到底有什么用呢？
我发现记笔记对我是有帮助的，但是很麻烦，效果也没有大家说得那么神奇。记笔记到底怎样才能简单又高效呢？
我看了不少人的笔记经验介绍都觉得特别好，但自己一用就觉得不顺手。怎样打造一套适合自己的简单又高效的笔记系统呢？

这篇文章就结合我们这几年记笔记的心得，简要地回答这几个问题。希望能帮到对记笔记有疑惑的朋友。
一、记笔记有什么用？
没用的笔记各有各的没用，有用的笔记只需做到两件事：收集和整理。收集帮助我们清空大脑，专注当下；整理帮助我们连接笔记，加速知识的积累和碰撞。
收集
收集，就是把我们所有的想法都捡起来放在一起。
我周边很多朋友都对收集自己的想法嗤之以鼻。大学的时候有一位朋友会在酒席饭桌上随时掏出笔记本来写两句。周围的人都笑他：你是天才嘛？有什么灵感必须这会儿记下来？这是好多人都有的思维误区。大家以为只有天才需要随时随地记笔记；因为只有天才才有灵感，而只有灵感才值得记录。其实，值得记下来的不仅仅是灵感。最需要记笔记的或许不是天才，而是我们这些普通人。
我们可以试着先问一下自己，忙碌的间隙，我们都想了些什么呢？好多人会说：“我在想今天吃什么。” 没错，大脑就是天生的规划狂魔，无时不刻不在设想下一步该做什么。所以我们很多有意无意的想法都跟未来有关，包括但不限于计划、提醒、担心和问题。而所谓的灵感，通常只占其中很小的一部分。反倒是那些琐碎的计划、提醒、担心、问题等等占据了我们的大脑。只有把这些琐碎的念头都记下来，我们的大脑才能轻装上阵。
举两个啰嗦的例子做对比，方便大家明白。
例子一，没有收集想法的工作日上午。

                    <span>最初的标题是「试论学习效率」，但仔细一想又觉得技巧与工具大同小异，讲与效率相关的拖延症也是老生常谈。因此在这里试图抛砖引玉，探讨这个至今我难以解答的问题：为什么我们会对有关「提高效率」，「提升自我」这一课题无法自拔。
为什么关注效率？
首先，为什么要关心效率？自我反省下来，原因不多：

人一生的时间是有限的。
每个人的一天都是24个小时
为了在更短的时间内，比别人学得更多，然后获得某种意义上的胜利。

最后一点的无奈之处在于，只有「更多」才能在他人面前表现出来。因为即便是浅层的理解，通常在面试和聊天环境下也不会过于深入的讨论。
但是我们都清楚， 质量更为重要。
高效率 &#x3D; 完成更多；高效率 ≠ 高质量？
在这集 How to Structure Your Writing Day with Francesco Cirillo @ Become a Writer Today 播客里，主持人邀请了番茄钟的创始人来分享他对时间管理的看法：「我们应该把时间看作朋友而不是敌人，否则就失去了对自我的掌控。」
在博客里，他分享了番茄钟常见的错误使用：

设置超长番茄钟：把一个番茄钟的时常限制在40分钟以内的原因是为了能让今天的第一个番茄钟和最后一个番茄钟能进行同等质量的工作。
忽视短休息的重要性：人们通常跳过短休息，亦或者在休息期间没有放空大脑（依旧想着手头上的事）。

产生这两个错误的原因归根结底其实就是害怕会打断心流，害怕我们要因为重新酝酿（或等待）「动力」而浪费时间，但是往往这么做反而让自身在工作面前失去了掌控力。因为当你开始害怕被打断时，时间就成为了你的敌人，而你要让时间成为你的盟友。
在 Paul Graham 的 博客 How to Work Hard 里提到，努力最重要的是质量，时间（effort）和天赋（talent）占比不大。这与卡尔·纽波特的《深度工作》核心观点一致，其…</span>

@宛潼：升级改造也值得记录
自从离职之后，我才有了更多时间来整理自己的桌面。但目前来说还不算是特别满意，主要是有很多细节和基础上的东西没有完善，例如桌子不够大、一些产品的外观或使用体验还没达到预期等等。因此，你在这里看到的其实是我正在升级改造中的版本，等到未来各方面基本达到了我满意的效果之后，再来写一篇文章和大家分享。

生产力套件
桌面必不可少的就是电脑、显示器和键鼠「生产力四大件」了。
由于我日常的工作多偏向于文字类型，同时还有开 Windows 虚拟机玩游戏（上古的 RTS 游戏，对配置要求不高）的需求，因此电脑依然还是旧的 Mac mini 2018 款，并没有升级到 M1。这台 Mac mini 购买时是最低的 8GB 内存，我自己升级到了 32GB，目前使用来说还是十分流畅，没有出现过爆内存的问题。

显示器则是我自己 DIY 的一款显示器，面板是 LG 32UL950 的同款，4K 的分辨率，Nano IPS 技术，色域达到了 98% 的 Display P3。同时，我还选用了一个与 Pro Stand 风格类似的底座，从正面看上去的效果非常棒。不过，显示器的背壳和驱动板我还没有很满意，日后会针对这两个部分进行升级，主要是换成原装显示器的雷电 3 驱动板，再自己去定做一个纯平的阳极氧化铝背板，最终实现全铝合金的外观。

键鼠我选用的是罗技的 MX 套装 —— MX Keys 和 MX Master 3。鼠标这一块不用多说，配合 Logi Options+ 可以实现触控板上的所有操作，而且握持感也非常不错。键盘则是近期更换的，因…</span>

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人：
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

从自我介绍开始
我是 津津乐道播客网络 的创始人朱峰，从 2000 年开始创业，津津乐道算是我的第五个创业项目。津津乐道是一个播客制作机构，我们希望通过声音这个媒介，让各领域的专业人士分享他们的所见所闻和有意思的经验、观点。通过播客，让专业人士建立属于自己的个人品牌和影响力。截止到现在，我们已经制作了十多档节目，围绕一、二线城市，3–5 年工作经验的 TMT 从业者，提供他们感兴趣的音频内容。

分享一件今年让你印象最深刻或者意义最重大的事
如果五年后回头看，2021 年一定是平淡、承上启下的一年，我们经历了 2020 年疫情的震惊、对每个人生活的重大改变，2021 年我们都在尽力尝试建立新的秩序和生活方式，我不觉得 2021 年会有什么「重大」的事情，大家都在努力适应后疫情的新世界，可能就是 2021 最令人印象深刻的事情吧。
过去一年，有没有哪些城市或地方是您想再去一次的？
曾经津津乐道最受欢迎的节目类目是旅行，但因为疫情，大家将近 3 年没有出过国门了，而国内时常爆发的小范围疫情也让人很难下决心来一场远游。我们希望在疫情后，可以重新拜访我们曾经去过的每一座城市，看看那里的人、那里的事有了什么改变。为了这个计划，我们跟大约20多个城市的听友都约定好，到时候一定回去再看一看，与他们聊一聊疫情给大家带来了什么。
如果让你用一个词概括自己的 2021 年，你会用什么词？
「且看」——这是津津乐道节目的一个梗，很多无法当时给出结论的事情，我们都会用这个词来概括，而整个 2021，其实也映衬了这个词的必要性：多看少做，苟下来静观市场的变化，比盲目下结论、做决定重要得多。
今年有学到什么新方法或新技能吗？
今年我们系统性地学习和梳理了播客节目制作的 SOP，把我们这五年积累的经验变成标准，希望能够把绝大多数的节目制作变成一个可以复制的工业化流程，降低大家制作播客、参与播客的门槛，让每位并不精通内容制作的专业人士也能利用播客这个媒介讲出他们自己的故事。
谈谈你的年度照片吧
我们的节目又一次帮助一个创业团队完成了冷启动，这是一家现饮精酿啤酒品牌——BlueArk，通过播客节目的介绍，让用户、投资者在更多维度上更深入的认识、了解了他们，完成了他们的 MVP 验证和第一轮融资。这是抖、快这类「快内容」完全做不到的事情，我们很自豪。

谈谈你的你的年度的电影吧
非常惭愧的是，这一年读得书太少，唯一几本也是专业领域的书籍，似乎对大家没有特别大的推荐价值。但倒是可以给大家推荐一部电影——《大空头》。这部电影诞生于 2015 年，不是一部新片。但故事表达的观点在今天看来却是极具价值的：当大家都在狂欢的时候，冷静与理性是极为宝贵的。这一年，播客行业经历了很多事情，年初，「风口」这个关键词一次又一次的被提及，一度让大家觉得播客即将是下一个抖快，马上就要被风吹起来了。而年末的一地鸡毛告诉大家，理智的市场判断远比一次又一次的追逐风口宝贵得多，在现下的市场环境下，排除噪音，做好判断可能会比盲目的投入、扩张更为考验创业团队的经验。

推荐一个你的年度好物
云鲸拖地机器人。扫地机器人很成熟了，但如果经常做家务你肯定会发现其实扫地以外，拖地更是刚需，而扫地机器人的拖地能力实在是比较鸡肋的，直到我们遇到这款几乎专门为拖地设计的设备。 因为工作特别忙，几乎不可能抽出时间每天拖地，现在只需要定时设置一个拖地任务，当扫地机器人工作完毕，就放出来云鲸来拖地。尤其是有宠物的家庭，懂的都懂。

展望一下你的 2022 年吧
2021 年末，我们拿到了第一笔融资，团队也有所扩大。而播客仍旧是一个小众市场，我们希望通过我们的努力，帮助作者、主播们建立他们的内容优势，不仅在内容制作层面，在技术层面我们也准备把我们内部运营很多年的节目分发、托管平台拿出来给大家免费使用，还为此开发了动态广告投放的系统，帮助主播们更轻松的获得正反馈，鼓励他们把内容持续的做下去。2022 年可能仍旧是困难的一年，但我们总会看到希望的，不是么？

Data exploration and analysis is a time-consuming process. We’ll continue to explore the Telco Customer Churn dataset to get a brief overview of data by using the descriptive statistical analysis method.

Conclusion
In part 2 of the series, Guide to Churn Prediction, we explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify dependent and independent features, find missing values, and understand their mechanisms.

                    <span>A crucial part of every project is planning. Luckily for us, it&#x27;s also where the most fun is! 
Contrary to popular belief, design is not about drawing, but about making assumptions, validating them and deciding how your service will work.
There are various ways of doing it and, chances are, you&#x27;ll come up with your own. Therefore, just to give you something to start with, I&#x27;ll share the way I do it.
I call it lazy developer design 🤪, but you can refer to it as agile data driven user-first continuous design and development methodology 🤯 if you must.
It boils down to the principle of doing as little design as possible, then doing as little coding as possible, rinse and repeat.
So, what are we building today?

                    <span>Developing the &quot;onboarding&quot; process for a new person in an engineering team takes a lot of dedication, and keeping this process fluid takes even more work (with as little friction as possible).
This issue is challenging for any team working full time, it is even worse for Open Source projects where contributors usually work in their spare time. We should make this process as fluid as possible so that people don&#x27;t get discouraged by the complexity of getting up there and testing, until they make their first pull request.
Every developer has a different way of setting up a development environment, even if it is in a popular technology (programming language) with lots of documentation, text editor extensions (emacs, vim, vscode, ...), etc.
We developers are used to “our way” of doing things, …</span>

I recently posted a tutorial on how to better manage and maintain the lifecycle of Azure resources, automating resource decommissions by using a simple Decommission tag with a date value, and an Azure serverless Function App. The tutorial also includes how to track successful and failed decommissions using the function apps own storage account by recording the decommission events into table storage.
The full tutorial can be found here:

                    <span>Continuing on with my last post, I want to look at another function which I consider particularly elegant, the psi combinator:
const psi &#x3D; (f) &#x3D;&gt; (g) &#x3D;&gt; (x, y) &#x3D;&gt; g(f(x), f(y));

In TypeScript:
const psi &#x3D; (f: (x: A) &#x3D;&gt; B) &#x3D;&gt;
  (g: (x: B, y: B) &#x3D;&gt; C) &#x3D;&gt;
  (x: A, y: A): C &#x3D;&gt;
  g(f(x), f(y));

This is also called on in Haskell.
What it does is map a function over both arguments of a binary(two-argument) function. This is similar to the B combinator but changed to work on binary functions.
The quintessential usage is when sorting records:
// given a compare function
const localeCompare &#x3D; (item1: string, item2: string): number &#x3D;&gt;
  item1.localeCompare(item2);

// and some accessor function that drills into a data structure
const getName &#x3D; (person) &#x3D;&gt; person.name;

// compose that accessor with the compare function to drill both sides
const compareNames &#x3D; psi(getName)(localeCompare);

// which can be passed to a sort method for an array of that structure
people.sort(compareNames)

Interestingly, this is equivalent to doing a map and then sort, but using psi is theoretically more memory efficient:
// generates an extra array
people.map(getName).sort(localeCompare)

Look out for other opportunities to use psi and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find them. Particularly if you&#x27;re doing data aggregation or processing. 
Pedantic Disclaimer: Psi is usually defined with the binary function as the first argument but I preferred the similarity  to B combinator when taking the mapping function as the first.</span>

The OCI python SDK allows us to write code to manage resources in Oracle cloud
You can download the SDK from:

PIP Install
The easiest way is using the pip install, by executing:

Also, remember to add this line to your python code, so you can be able to use the SDK

If you have follow until here, you may encounter an error, when trying to use any command on the SDK, and why is that? - well, in order to connect to OCI resources, you need:

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re going to build out a random number generator using JavaScript. Random number generators are a fantastic beginner JavaScript project. You get to work with some of the important basics while creating something that serves an actual use!

I&#x27;ve been asked before about when we would actually use a random number generator. Sure, it&#x27;s a fun quick, project, but what are some of the real life use cases?
Typically, you would use it as a standalone app like we&#x27;ve created here. It would likely be used within a larger application. A function such as randomNum() would return a random number, which could in turn do something like grab a specific item from an array (at the index of the random number returned). This allows you to create a basic lottery style system within an application.

本周话题：一个程序员的财务独立之路
本周，推荐一篇美国程序员的文章。
作者20岁时第一次当实习生，发现在 IT 行业，普通人有可能在30多岁就实现&quot;财务独立&quot;，不再为维持生计和支付日常账单而劳碌。以前，他一直以为每个人都需要工作到退休。
从此，他就将财务独立作为自己的人生目标。

2009年，他大学毕业了，没有任何积蓄，进入英特尔公司担任初级工程师。当时的年薪是10万美元，年支出3.8万美元，再扣掉税，第一年就有了3.5万美元的净资产。
以后，他每年都记账。在这篇文章里面，他公开了收入和支出（见下表）。十二年以后的2021年，他已经是亚马逊的高级工程师，年薪62.5万美元（含股票），年支出7.8万美元，净资产达到了240万美元（含股票）。

他详细说了，自己怎么经过十二年的奋斗，在35岁做到财务独立，我觉得很有借鉴意义。
（1）首要的努力方向，就是追求工资提升。 普通人的收入来源，主要还是本职工作，如果工资很低，根本不可能实现财务独立，所以必须想方设法提高工资。
一般来说，大厂的高级职位可以拿到稳定的高工资。所以，他要求自己一定要进大厂，并且做到高级工程师。
（2）每过三年，就到别处面试。 他一般三年换一家公司，这样可以获得显著的加薪和晋升。他说每次换公司，收入至少增加30%。另外，还可以让自己始终拥有一种进取的心态，不断…</span>

                    <span>本田汽车的时钟穿越回 20 年前，且无法修复

本田和讴歌车主报告说，他们的时钟和日历被卡在 2002 年的 某个时间。本田公司说它正在调查，如果它没有找到修复方法，时钟应该在 8 月的某个时候自行纠正。这可能是配备的导航系统的 GPS 导致的。一位用户发现，它的 GPS 日期被设置为 2002 年 5 月 19 日，也就是过去的整整 1024 周。GPS 从一个纪元开始测量时间，然后广播一个代表一周的数字，这个数字最大为 1024，每 19.6 年达到最大值之后会回滚。虽然上次回滚是 2019 年 4 月 6 日，但可能本田汽车的 GPS 增加了一个偏移量，因而在 2022 年第一周发生了回滚。


老王点评：虽然千年虫问题已经人尽皆知了，但是还是有粗心的程序员总是出现各种溢出问题。




聊天机器人仍然很蠢

50 年前，AI 专家曾经预测几年内会出现“相当于普通人类水平的通用智能机器”，然而并没有。根本障碍 在于，尽管计算机算法确实非常善于识别统计模式，但它们不知道这些模式意味着什么。大型语言模型（LLM）可能是由统计学驱动的。与 Google 最先进的聊天机器人 LaMDA 的对话令人印象深刻，非常像人类的口吻，但是它们不过是“流利的废话喷井”，或者是“随机鹦鹉”罢了。


老王点评：这些聊天机器人只是知道“应该”怎么回答，但是它其实并不知道说的是什么。




英国警方扣押了超过 4 亿美元比特币

根据 披露的信息，英国警方扣押了价值超过 4 亿美元的比特币和其它加密货币。英国警方缴获了这些加密货币并将其出售：一半交给英国内政部，另一半用于重新投入调查。

另外，据报告，2021 年加密货币相关犯罪的规模 高达 140 亿美元，而 2020 年才 78 亿美元。


老王点评：这比打击一般的违反犯罪行为的缴获更多，警察们也更有动力。

                    <span>最近，多数读者可能已经了解到了一些关于 Log4j 漏洞的信息，这个漏洞自从 12 月 9 日披露出来之后，不断给系统管理员增加烦恼。这个漏洞比较容易利用，可以用来进行远程代码执行，而且整个互联网上的服务器中到处都有这个问题。把它称为近年来被披露的最糟糕的漏洞之一，并不算夸张。从某种意义上来说，从 Log4j 中得到的教训并没有什么新的内容，但这个漏洞确实进一步明确地突出了自由软件生态系统中的一些问题。

出了什么问题？

有很多文章详细描述了这个 bug 的机制，以及如何利用，在这个 页面 上就收集了很多。简而言之：Log4j™ 是一个 Java 日志软件包，由 Apache 软件基金会注册了商标并进行发布。它已经被包含进了许多其他项目，在互联网上到处都可以找到 Log4j。事实上，根据这篇 文章，Log4j 已经被下载了超过 2800 万次（仅仅统计了过去四个月里的情况）并且是将近 7000 个其他项目的依赖项。因此，Log4j 中的漏洞很可能就会成为碰巧使用了它的那些其他系统中的漏洞。

正如 Apache 软件基金会在 6 月份自豪地发出的一条 推文 所说，它甚至也存在于火星上的灵巧号直升机之中。

通常情况下，人们认为一个日志工具应该只是把感兴趣的数据接收下来并可靠地记录下来。Log4j 似乎做到了这一点，但它也做了一些可以说是任何日志系统都不应该做的事情：它主动地对要记录的数据进行解释、并相应地采取行动。它可以做的事情之一就是查询远程服务器的数据，并将其纳入日志信息中。例如，它可以从 LDAP 服务器获取信息并加入到日志中，这样在人们希望在日志中加入某个用户的详细账户信息的数据时，这个功能就会很有用。

然而，事实上远程目录服务器可以提供更多形式的数据，比如说可以提供一个序列化处理（serialized）的 Java 对象，被后续重新组装起来进行执行。…</span>

今年，我们刊登了几篇关注商业中的开源的好文章。这些文章展示了开源作为工具、平台或集成点在商业中的力量。让我们回顾一下 2021 年的一些顶级开源商业故事。

《我最喜欢的开源项目管理工具》

如果你在办公环境中管理过项目，你很可能使用微软 Project 来跟踪任务和分配。然而，开源社区已经创造了许多跟踪项目的选项。对于你的 项目管理需求，Frank Bergmann 写了关于使用 Redmine、project-open、ProjectLibre、GanttProject、TaskJuggler 和 ProjeQtOr。

《使用 Apache Superset 进行开源商业智能报告》

通过商业智能，你可以通过对数据进行分类、安排结果和显示上下文信息来更好地了解你的信息。对于任何想要做出“数据驱动”决策的组织来说，商业智能（BI）是一项关键技术。Maxime Beauchemin 的文章讨论了 Apache Superset，以及它如何成熟地成为一个领先的开源 BI 解决方案。

《6 个用于餐馆和零售商的 WordPress 插件》

这场大流行病可能永久性地改变了许多人喜欢做生意的方式。餐馆和其他当地的零售机构不能再像以前那样依赖上门交易了。网上订购食品和其他物品已经成为一种常态和期望。当大流行结束后，消费者不太可能背弃电子商务的便利。Don Watkins 写了 六个开源插件，帮助你创建一个 WordPress 网站，满足你的客户对网上购物、路边取货和送货的偏好。它还可以建立你的品牌和你的客户群。

《试试 Chatwoot，一个开源的客户关系平台》

在任何有面向客户的业务中，保持与客户的互动是至关重要的。我们最后一次接触这个客户是什么时候，或者他们最后一次接触我们是什么时候？我们的组织中谁做了回应？什么服务水平协议制约着这种关系？这些和其他问题最好在客户关系管理系统（CRM）中进行管理。Nitish Tiwari 介绍了 Chatwoot，一个用 Ruby 和 Vue.js 构建的开源客户关系平台。Chatwoot 是从零开始写的，目的是让客户关系团队建立端到端的票据管理和支持平台。本文将介绍 Chatwoot 的架构、安装和主要功能。

《试试 Dolibarr，一个开源的客户关系管理平台》

无论你是经营零售店、餐厅、酒吧、超市、健身房还是其他业务，你都需要一个可靠的方式来与你的客户保持联系。毕竟，他们是客户，因为他们喜欢你做的事情，如果他们与你分享了他们的联系信息，他们想听到更多关于你所提供的东西。Pradeep Vijayakumar 介绍了 Dolibarr 项目，一个开源的企业资源规划（ERP）和客户关系管理（CRM）软件。Dolibarr 提供了一整套 ERP 功能，包括销售点（POS）、发票、存货和库存管理、销售订单、采购订单和人力资源管理。

《微软 Exchange 的一个开源替代品》

多年来，微软 Exchange 作为群件环境的必然选择。然而，在 2020 年末，一个奥地利的开源软件开发商推出了 grommunio，它是一个群件服务器和客户端，其外观和感觉为 Exchange 和 Outlook 用户所熟悉。Markus Feilner 写了关于 grommunio 如何在企业中取代 Exchange，成为群件的一个强大而功能齐全的选择。

《用这个开源工具简化发票的指南》

许多 IT 项目在开发过程中会延迟、超出预算，并出现巨大的变化。这些问题使开具发票成为 IT 领域最费力的活动之一。Frank Bergmann 写了一篇关于开源项目如何 简化开票过程 的文章。如果你决定成为自雇人士或成立一个创业公司，Frank 的文章也可以作为处理财务工作的指南。

开源是好生意

开源软件不仅仅是为开发者服务的。企业也可以利用开源软件的力量。事实上，开源是许多商业领域的一个主要驱动力。你今天使用的工具可能本身就是开源软件，或者使用开源作为堆栈的一部分。

                    <span>Linux Mint 20.3 “Una” 有一些细微的视觉变化，弥补了现代外观，以及新的应用改进。




代号为 “Una” 的 Linux Mint 20.3 终于来了。官方公告应该很快就会跟进，但它现在已经可以下载了！

虽然 Linux Mint 20.2 有一些令人印象深刻的改进，但 Linux Mint 20.3 看起来也是一个不错的版本。

在这里，我会重点指出 Linux Mint 20.3 的关键变化。

Linux Mint 20.3 的新变化



在这个版本中，Linux Mint 20.3 包含了最新的 Cinnamon 5.2，一些细微的视觉变化，以及其他各种改进。

请注意，在 Xfce 和 MATE 版中的变化是一样的（不包括桌面环境的具体改进）。

Cinnamon 5.2 桌面环境

在 Cinnamon 5 中，增加了一些调整和管理桌面环境所消耗资源的功能。

这一次，升级的重点是几个新功能。日历小程序增强了功能，当你点击系统时间/日期图标时，可以直接从系统托盘上显示事件。

如果你使用 GNOME 日历或在线账户（如 Google 日历），这些事件应该是同步的。



除此以外，你还会发现 Nemo 文件管理器的改进和窗口动画的细微变化。

还有一些必要的错误修复和总体上的小改进。

新的背景

新的版本、新的壁纸，总是令人耳目一新。而且，Mint 20.3 也不会让你失望。



你会得到一个精心策划的美妙的壁纸集，你可以选择使用。

视觉主题刷新及深色模式



在 Linux Mint 20.3 中，主题已经进行了改造，对重点颜色轻微进行了重新处理（使其更时尚一些），并从一些小部件中删除了它。

与窗口的圆角一起，这构成了一个更干净和现代的外观。

总的来说，包括新的图标，Linux Mint 20.3 带来了一个新的主题包。

如果你想要同样的外观，同时保持其他的优点，你可以简单地从仓库安装传统主题包并应用它。



一旦你安装了传统主题包，就可以在选择中找到它了。



不仅如此，你可以注意到，我更喜欢用深色模式的截图来写文章，因为 Linux Mint 20.3 终于把更多的注意力放在深色模式上！

一些默认的应用程序，如 Hypnotix、Gnome 终端、Celluloid，都是在启用深色模式的情况下启动的。如果你愿意，你可以永久地禁用它们。

新的 Thingy 应用程序

当 Clem（Linux Mint 的首席开发者）暗示会有一个新的惊喜应用时，我们 很快就在 Linux Mint 20.3 里发现了它。

在稳定版更新之前，测试版就已经确认了它。



新的 Thingy 应用程序也被称为 “Library”，它实际上是 Linux Mint 默认的文档管理器。你可以下载电子书和其他 PDF 文件，Library 应用应该会自动从下载目录中检测到它。

应用程序的改进



一些默认的应用程序，如 Hypnotix IPTV 播放器和便签现在可以分别让你搜索频道或便签。

                    <span>虽然很爱看大家的年终总结，但今年自己还是不写了吧，因为或多或少每天都在总结。
翻看自己去年年初的 #202 (2021 的 3 个小目标) 发现很多都没完成，去年的目标不知不觉又变成了今年的目标，但我还是相信这一点，无论怎样，烂计划都是强于无计划的。
前些时候看到了一篇文章，触动到谈不上，但真的从中获益了很多，这种获益体现在，此刻我在打这篇文章 -- 我的个人 OKR 实践 01, 是的，一直随心所欲的我今年也开始定 OKR 了，对于 OKR 我更多的是关注自身，希望自己不会因为年龄的增长变得油腻，变得世故，变成了曾经眼里的傻逼
关于奖励
完成这三个的 KR1 就奖励自己个 AirPods Pro 吧
完成这三个的 KR2 就奖励自己个 HHKB 吧
完成这三个的 KR3 就奖励自己个 XBOX 吧
OKR1 学日语
自己想学好日语太久了，也放弃太多次了，最多的一次学到初级下第 3 课，从小时候玩游戏，读村上春树开始就一直想学好，不用受汉化的束缚，回忆起来，大一时候第一次背 50 音图，10 多年过去了，还是没学成，不想说什么最好的时候就是 10 年前和今天 ，但真的想学学，嗯。现在水平是初级上，希望今年能多进步些，作为 OKR1 也代表自己的决心吧。
KR1 每天背单词，总结语法，过三级，7月份考
KR2 过三级后坚持每天学习，看 1-2 集动漫，额外学习 1 小时
KR3 考 2级
OKR2 身体
虽然天天跑步，天天做俯卧撑，但自己也天天喝酒，搞的自己成了个健壮的胖子，体检报告也开始不理想，虽然一年也没生病，但看到好的身材快的速度还是羡慕，哎，又减肥了
KR1 瘦到 140 并保持 --&gt; 具体的跑步和饮食计划（评论）
KR2 瘦到 125
KR3 回到自己 ins 头像的身材，或者更好 ins --&gt; https://www.instagram.com/yihonghaha/
OKR3 编程
不多解释，吃饭和兴趣
KR1 学习 Rust, 自己项目保持更新，多贡献好玩的项目，写日语命令行的新项目
KR2 学 database 学常见算法，学分布式
KR3 500 lines 常见的完成</span>

前言
刚把 MVC , MVP , MVVM 深入理解了一波,最近又开始各种推送 MVI 的文章,碰巧谷歌又发布了最新的 Android应用架构指南 ,大致看了下发现正式最近正火的 MVI ！这可真是巧巧的妈妈生巧巧,于是上手实践了一下,只能说有规范就是好,真香
指南帮助我解决了以前开发过程中遇到的很多疑惑点,再也不怕和小伙伴争论了,直接指南怼脸，舒坦
架构概述
最新架构基于 界面和数据分离 和 数据模型驱动界面 两个原则,将应用分为三层

其中最主要的是 界面层 和 数据层
界面层
职责
将应用数据转换为界面数据,显示在UI上
提供状态容器(ViewModel)
处理界面事件
重点
业务逻辑和界面逻辑
业务逻辑决定着如何处理状态变化。业务逻辑通常位于网域层或数据层中，但绝不能位于界面层中。
界面行为逻辑(界面逻辑) 决定着如何在屏幕上显示状态变化。例如点击按钮跳转,消息提示等
界面逻辑（尤其是在涉及 Context 等界面类型时）应位于界面中，而非ViewModel中.
同一应用的业务逻辑在不同移动平台或设备类型上保持不变，但界面行为逻辑在实现方面可能有所不同。界面层页定义了这些类型的逻辑
界面事件处理
事件划分
界面事件：应在界面层处理的操作
用户事件：用户在与应用互动时生成的事件
ViewModel 通常负责处理特定用户事件的业务逻辑
事件决策树

如果操作是在界面树中比较靠下一层生成的，例如在 RecyclerView 项或自定义 View 中，ViewModel 应仍是处理用户事件的操作。
界面状态和状态容器
界面状态
界面状态需要包含界面显示的全部信息
界面状态定义不可变
只有数据源或数据所有者才应负责更新其公开的数据
状态容器
负责提供界面状态，并且包含执行相应任务所必需的逻辑。状态容器有多种大小…</span>

                    <span>引子
在文章的开始，若要简单讲述我要叙说的「在地感」关于什么，是不需耗费多少笔墨的：它的核心即为强调人与特定生活场景的联系，以达到「在此地，做某事，生何情」的状态。我们或许听说过「不要在卧室做别的事情，有助于快速入睡」的生活实用贴士，也听说过 「 自由职业的危险主要来自于床和桌子离得太近  」 的段子，常常涉及的「工作和生活分区」就是我要讲述的「在地感」的其中一个部分。
在将近两年有意无意的尝试中，我已经基本建立了自己的一套系统和模式。在我的观念中，「在地感（A Sense of Place）」的营造不仅仅局限于地理空间与空间设置，而有意识地使用设备、注重设备使用方法和频繁自我沟通同样是可行的好办法。
本文将探讨我对于将「在地感」引入个人生活尤其数字生活的缘起和经历。注意：该名称并非本意即指这样的生活管理方法论，而类似于“工作生活分区”这样的思想也早就存在，我试图做到的是用该术语代指更为概括化的此类方法论，从而让其适用更为广泛，形成一个类似于「数字极简」、「低碳生活」等有明确所指的简洁词汇，便于分享与实行。
写作本篇文章时，正处于西安封城期间，在公寓里有限的空间里我通过这种意识，还算没有失去正常生活的节奏：这种节奏感无论于心理健康还是生活趣味都极为关键。我将会在简单阐述这种意识后，说一说我是如何实际操作并且从中受益的。

 
那么究竟什么是「在地感」？
「Sense of Place」在维基百科中文词条显示为「 场所感 」。它在各个学科、不同领域均有相似内核而具备不同细节的内涵，而我最初接触该术语起源于文化遗产管理领域。在文化遗产管理中，人们会对于文化遗产的所在地具备情感、故事、私人联系，以及围绕着场景产生的故事；而在 2012 年，有 学者 提出，在环境心理学中人们通常对于地点具备依恋感（attachment），并且使地点具备其意义。
在我眼中，人与社会具备相对健康的联系…</span>

[美剧] 波巴·费特之书

关键词：动作 / 科幻 / 冒险
片长：60 分钟（单集）× 7 集；豆瓣链接

史上最强，赏金猎人。

@潘誉晗：事实证明，只要迪士尼认真起来就还是「业内大佬」。作为《曼达洛人》的衍生剧，《波巴·费特之书》用剧集本身的热度和口碑完美诠释了什么叫做「衍生剧的衍生剧，也可以很好看」。
剧集的主人公波巴·费特是「星球大战」IP 里非常著名的角色之一，他是银河系最令人闻风丧胆的赏金猎人詹戈·费特的克隆体。在《星球大战 2：克隆人的进攻》里的克隆人战争爆发的前十年，詹戈以自己作为克隆人模版为条件，要求获得一个未经任何改造的、和其他克隆人不一样的复制体，这个复制体就是后来的波巴。而本剧的主要内容就是讲述在贾巴去世之后…</span>

                    <span>引言
时值期末季，不少读者或许还保留着当年寒假前领取成绩单的回忆。那张薄纸上的数字和话语，代表着对我们前一个阶段表现的评价。
在科技行业中，Apple 可谓是被评价最为频繁的公司之一。由于影响力之广、用户数之多，似乎谁都能点评出一两句来。用户当然有权评价，但这样的评论确实容易偏于零散和即兴——Apple 的业务涉及好几条不同产品线、上百种不同型号，横跨软件、硬件和服务领域，它在不同方面的表现必然有高低之分；关于 Apple 的资讯动态连篇累牍，但同一件产品、同一个事件分别放在出现当时和一段时间之后观察，很可能就有不同的意义。
因此，像成绩单那样，将过去一个时间段的整体表现分为多个「科目」、分别给予评价，或许是更有参考性、更能反映规律的做法。
这也正是我们想要提出的问题：对于 Apple 在 2021 年的各方面表现，你打几分？
需要说明，这一模式并不是我们的原创。从 2015 年开始，国外知名 Apple 领域博主 Jason Snell 每年均会制作称为《Apple Report Card》的同类选题（今年的结果尚未发表），已经形成了比较完善的格式，且积累了一定的趋势数据。
然而，Jason Snell 调查的基本都是美国用户，其结果反映的也必然是美国用户的观点。作为在 Apple 用户中举足轻重的另一群体，中文用户理应发出体现自己独特视角的声音。
为此，我们借鉴了这种模式，在 2021 年底，向 20 名具有一定影响力的中文 Apple 用户发出问卷，请他们从九个维度对 Apple 在 2021 年的表现作出评价。

受访者中，既有 Apple 生态耕耘多年的开发者，也有见多识广的投资人；既有平时从事科技测评、影像制作的「专业」用户，也有用 Apple 产品处理日常工作学习的建筑行业、学术圈用户；其中不少还是少数派读者熟悉和喜爱的熟面孔。我们相信，这能比较全面地反映不同…</span>

2022.1.7 尽量每周五更新
《瞎玩菌的游戏周报》是我对游戏领域的观察和点评。具有以下特点：

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

享乐
推荐好的游戏音乐，希望更多人因为音乐对游戏产生兴趣（我就是）。

一点必要的声明：

虽然本文不涉及，但是修改卡内金额和未经同意复制他人卡片都属于违法行为。

这篇文章拖了又拖，一开始是我把事情想复杂了。所以这里不写原理只写做法，有用就行。
本文仅是对自己折腾门禁卡的总结，希望针对两种情况给大家提供一点思路：

自家门禁卡不够用，去物业办理又太麻烦或者太贵1
想把门禁卡放在手机上或手环上

把门禁卡放手机、手环上主要原因有两个：一是预防忘带钥匙（门禁卡）的情况，比如临时下楼取快递、外卖，出门着急忘带门禁卡用不了电梯；二是减少一样随身物品，毕竟用指纹锁已经可以少带钥匙了，但是门禁卡还得带在身上。另外冬天去兜里或者包里掏门禁卡这个小东西并不方便，而手机总在手上。
回到门禁卡。本文所讨论的门禁卡，最常用的有两种，ID 卡和 IC 卡，其中 ID 卡无法用手机模拟，但可以通过贴纸来实现；iPhone 暂时不支持复制门禁卡，也可以通过贴纸来实现或者去物业写入，最后会补充；Android 手机通常可以在手机系统自带的「钱包」应用里看看，如果有创建空白卡功能，则大概率可行。
下面展开讲讲。
简单确认门禁卡类型
门禁卡种类繁多，但我们没必要了解太多专业知识。这里简单将我们日常生活中主要会用到的门禁卡分为 ID 卡和 IC 卡两种。
ID 卡是比较早期的门禁卡，卡上面一般会有 00 开头的十个数字。这种卡卡里只存一个号码，很容易复制。它们的外观参考这样：
ID 卡通常有「00」开头的十位数字卡号
不过也有例外，除了上图这种常见的水滴卡，还有长方形大卡片、滴胶卡等等。
IC 卡同样也可能采用水滴形设计，但卡片上一般…</span>

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
进入12月后，勇士队遭遇了一波进攻寒潮。11月，他们还能打出114.8分的百回合得分，而到了12月就只剩下了110.5分，在1月的三场比赛中更是低到了107.4分。相应地，球队核心库里也“难辞其咎”，个人百回合得分从11月的116.4分跌落到了12月的112.1、1月的110.2分，真实命中率更是从63.9%跌到了58.1%，1月份更是惨不忍睹的39.4%。
对于造成勇士和库里如此下滑的原因，首先当然是库里个人的消耗问题。本赛季，库里在每回合之中、特别是进攻端的移动距离，比之17-18、18-19赛季，都有了一定的上涨。在曾经的勇士2.0时代，库里已经是一个拥有大量无球跑动、不断进行换位移动的进攻手，而本赛季的他则在本已不小的跑动量上进一步提高，来到了后卫中进攻跑动第九多的位置，且年过三十的年龄，也在加兰、科尔安东尼、德章泰穆雷等一众年轻人之中，显得格外突出。而在防守端，由于勇士一贯采取的集体换防策略，库里的跑动量自然也不会少，18-19赛季就有着后卫中第八多的防守移动，而本赛季也只是相对下降了0.07米。况且，我们还需要考虑到库里为了增强防守对位能力而采取的增重，对身体造成更大的负担。

年龄的增加、体重的上升、移动的剧化，随着赛季的深入，这些问题逐渐开始影响库里，拉低了他的表现稳定性。这是每一个核心球星都必然面对的生涯阶段，出现波动，并不算非常离奇。而在此前的赛程中，勇士队也及时地找到了能为库里排忧解难、分担压力的替代者，乔丹普尔成为了球队的二号持球手，策动了相当比例的挡拆回合，也成为了比威少之于詹姆斯来得性价比远高的解压存在。
然而，这样的良好趋势，却在12月开始，特别是到了1月份的几场比赛，开始出现了裂痕。对此，我们可以从阵容搭配中的变量来做初步把握。球队进攻最为气势如虹的11月，乔丹普尔场均拥有31.5分钟的出场时间，14.7次出手，…</span>

恶心！恶心！

好了，抖机灵结束，回归正题。
与2021款理想One上市时刚买了老款的车主维权类似，这两件事的背后其实都反映了同一个问题——在脱离了传统的4S店销售模式后，新入局的玩家们如何在销售端处理好新老车型交替。
问题根源是没处理好车型新老交替时的销售策略
传统车企是怎么做的
俗话说“早买早享受，晚买有折扣”。
以往，传统车企在新款车型上市前夕，一般都会对店内库存的老款车型进行降价促销，用0库存来迎接新车的到来，否则新车上市后老车就砸手里了。
比如在新款奥迪A3上市前，老款A3的裸车价一度低至14万。
等新款上市后，初期一直都保持着20万的价格，即使到现在，最低报价也仍然在18万左右。
因此，虽然新A3相比老A3升级了很多内容，但是买老A3的用户看在6万块的差价上也不会觉得自己亏了。
当然，也有部分车型销量异常的好，直至生命周期末尾可能都没有优惠，但是这类车待新款上市后往往都需要加价排队提车。
所以老款还是会比新款便宜。
新势力们有哪些区别
但是随着越来越多的新势力入局之后，原先“车厂——4S店；4S店——用户”的交付链路变成了如今的“车厂——直营店/app——用户”。
车辆的终端售价也由原先“车企和4S店共同决定”变成了现在的“车企单独决定”。
但是为了保持品牌形象，新势力往往又不会主动选择在老款车型即将停产时降价。
再加上如今随着电动化、智能化的快速发展，汽车更新换代速度也明显要比以前快得多，消费者根本想不到一台车这么快就会成为老款。
这两个因素一叠加，在新款上市之际原价买了老款的用户自然觉得自己是被割了韭菜。
所以对于选择直营的企业来说，如果管理好用户的预期非常重要。
是不是所有新势力都没处理好？
也并不是，比如蔚来在这方面我认为还是处理得不错的。
一方面，蔚来通过“卖期货”这种方式让潜在消费者了解自己在未来半年或一年内的产品发布规划，防止打用户一个措手不及。
比如蔚来在2021年一月份就发布了ET7，并且开放了预定，而直到2022年1月才启动锁单。
对于ET7的潜在用户来说，如果在这期间看上了别的车，随时可以退预定金；而对于预定现有NT1.0产品的用户，他们也一定是在权衡了新技术和早提车之后才做出了选择。
另一方面，虽然蔚来不会主动调整车辆指导价，但是当现有老款车型竞争力不足时，蔚来会采用置换补贴、贴息以及其他商业优惠来变相降价。
因此，直营并不代表就无法妥善处理新老交替导致的销售问题。
售后问题
至于售后，老车主们还真不用太担心，毕竟赛力斯只是改了个名字，运营主体并没有变。
问界就是赛力斯，赛力斯就是问界。

ElliottFollow

    
I work on Developer experiences at Chrome and closely with the web platform
    
So let&#x27;s get cracking!
First step let&#x27;s make a new project and import some dependencies to help us develop.
mkdir controllers
cd controllers
git init
npm init --yes
npm i -D typescript lit
touch reducer.ts

Ok next we&#x27;ll set up the controller class in reducer.ts
import type { ReactiveController, ReactiveControllerHost } from &#x27;lit&#x27;;

export class ReducerController implements ReactiveController {
  constructor(
    public host: ReactiveControllerHost,
  ) {
    host.addController(this);
  }

  hostUpdate()?: void;
}

That hostUpdate signature is just to keep typescript from complaining. 🤷.
Our controller essentially bolts some statefullness onto a function which takes some state T and some action A and returns some other or the same state T. So let&#x27;s formalize that:
type Reducer &#x3D; (state: T, action: A) &#x3D;&gt; T;

The controller should take that reducer, along with some initial state, and pin them to the class instance.
export class ReducerController implements ReactiveController {
  public state: T;

  constructor(
    private host: ReactiveControllerHost,
    public reducer: Reducer,
    public initialState: T,
  ) {
    this.host.addController(this);
    this.state &#x3D; initialState;
  }

  hostUpdate?():void
}

Believe it or not we&#x27;re pretty much done. The last piece we need is to implement a dispatch method which takes an action A and updates the host.
dispatch(action: A): void {
  this.state &#x3D; this.reducer(this.state, action);
  this.host.requestUpdate();
}

And, as Chef John would say, that&#x27;s it!
If we want to use our controller, we just create it on a compatible host (like LitElement) and we&#x27;re off to the races:

                    <span>Introduction


This article will show you how to quickly create an ESP32 based &quot;smart device&quot;, using Arduino, by creating a simple application that basically connects your WiFi router, then a MQTT server, and publishes a message every five seconds.
Of course, you can use any other WiFi enabled board.
http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?Id&#x3D;1126
First, we need to add support to our ESP32 board.
In the Arduino preferences, in the Additional Boards Manager URLs field, add: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

In the Tools menu, open the Boards Manager and look for esp32, then install it.
Still in the Tools menu, choose your board (TTGO LoRa32-OLED V1 in my case)
In the Sketch menu, select Manage Libraries...

Install library PubSubClient

Installing RSpec, FactoryBot, Faker gems and configuring for testing environment. 
Ruby 3.0.1 + Rails 7.0.0
Let&#x27;s get right to it...
rails new projectname -d postgresql
cd projectname
git add -A
git commit -m &quot;initial commit&quot;

rails db:create
rails s

git checkout -b rspec

In Gemfile add...
group :development, :test do
  # See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#debugging-with-the-debug-gem
  gem &quot;debug&quot;, platforms: %i[ mri mingw x64_mingw ]
  gem &quot;rspec-rails&quot;
  gem &quot;factory_bot_rails&quot;
  gem &quot;faker&quot;
end

Back in terminal/command line...
bundle install
rails g rspec:install

Create &#x27;support&#x27; directory in &#x27;spec&#x27; directory and create two files
spec/support/factory_bot.rb
spec/support/chrome.rb

And then one file in the spec directory for factories.
spec/factories.rb

Configure FactoryBot
# spec/support/factory_bot.rb

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
end

Configure driver
# spec/support/chrome.rb

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:each, type: :system) do
    if ENV[&quot;SHOW_BROWSER&quot;] &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;true&quot;
      driven_by :selenium_chrome
    else
      driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome, screen_size: [1400, 1400]
    end
  end
end

Require support files in rails_helper.rb
# spec/rails_helper.rb

require_relative &#x27;support/factory_bot&#x27;
require_relative &#x27;support/chrome&#x27;

When you generate a User model (or any model) RSpec will generate a factory for you in your factories.rb file.
# spec/factories.rb

FactoryBot.define do
  factory(:user) do
    email { Faker::Internet.email }
    password { Faker::Internet.password }
  end
end

Run rspec command in the terminal and you should see it run and output some green text.

                    <span>Hiring a DevOps Engineer for the first time? Knowing what to look for in a talented engineer can be a challenge. In this article, I discuss what you can expect from a DevOps Engineer in today&#x27;s marketplace. I share some of my own experiences hiring DevOps Engineers in today&#x27;s competitive labor market. Finally, I talk about cheaper alternatives to hiring a full-time DevOps Engineer. 
In my past articles,  I&#x27;ve discussed DevOps release pipelines, stacks, and stages in-depth. A release pipeline is a software-driven process that development teams use to promote application changes from development into production. The pipeline creates multiple stacks - full versions of your application - across multiple stages of deployment.

When I ask, I get different responses and is cool to have this variety.
So I present my favorite apps/software of the last year
A sleep and meditation app, has a ton of meditation exercises and calm music. Really an amazing app , i wish it has a better web app but for now it’s ok.
This password manager is really useful. By now it makes all that it needs to do. Also it has VPN, and a dark web email analyzer. It is a really great password manager.
It is a time tracker useful when working on different projects and clients. For me i use it to know how many time i spent on different topics.
Another time tracker, this really blows my mind. It can track without specifying some task. When i open my PC it begins to track, really useful.
This was the year i began to use linux. Ubuntu has make things easier in development, although i had audio related issues, and the os freeze sometimes.

Poetry is a system package you can use to very easily manage your Python Packages. 
It makes handling your packages super easy. I have 9 Python packages under my name, and this is by far the best solution.

                    <span>Online courses are everywhere, and every day there are more. 
In a series of articles, I will explain my approach to online education. 
This is written in a personal way, maybe you can relate. It wasn&#x27;t always perfect, I was really slow and the start.
In my first year, I discover online courses, but I didn’t see it as a way that can help me at the time. 
I would only say to myself, this looks good but I don’t feel pressured to finish it, maybe someday, like when I am looking for a job I will have better reasons
As you may know, my way of thinking was not very mature, and it wasn’t because I was at school with so many hours and for me, it was not a big deal to finish.
The topics that interested me at the time were mainly programming and business. I enroll in 3 free udemy courses and paid for 3. I remember that I just completed 2 but because it was 2 hours or less, so no big deal.
As you may know, some Udemy Courses can get through 30 hours of content, and this makes it hard to finish. At the time I thought that more content meant that the course was better, but obviously, I was mistaken.
Finally, it is important to say that I just took courses from Spanish speakers instructors so as you may think, the offer was not very high back then.
This series will continue.

                    <span>What


The State is a Object where we store our values that belongs to the Component.
But what are Objects🤔 ??
So we have heard about the variables , they are the containers which used to store the data values.
Objects are also Variable but they can contain many values.
Like,
const car &#x3D;
{
    color:&quot;Red&quot;,
    Model:&quot;3&quot;,
    Name:&quot;Tesla&quot;
}

But we already have props then why we need the State.
Props used to pass data to Component but we can’t change the data once passed.
But state is used to store the Dynamic data .
It’s helps in making the Dynamic Web Application.
Also we need something which keep track what is happing in our Application.
State is Designed to Change in Response to the Event.

As u can see in the above example the uses of state.
We use state to find out like whether a use…</span>

                    <span>There’s a sad running gag in our industry: “Looking for junior developer with five years of experience.” (Examples: 2019, 2020, 2021.)
You can tell the contradiction: We can have close to no expectations of junior or, generally speaking, young and inexperienced developers.
Any expectations we do set change the profile we’re hiring for. To stick with the popular example, if we’re looking for someone with five years of experience, we’re looking for a medior. Not a junior. If we keep these expectations up insisting on hiring a junior, a working student, or even an intern, it gets ridiculous (and exploitative).

We’ve always known that the way colors are represented on a monitor doesn’t encompass the full width and breadth of colors that the human eye can perceive. As always, art is limited by the technology of the time – ages ago, color decisions were limited based on the relative expense of various dyes or paint colors to produce. That’s why purple is associated with royalty in many western cultures; purple dyes used to be quite expensive, so wearing purple clothes was a real flex! Similarly, early computers were limited to green text on a black background because the monochrome monitors used phosphor, and green phosphor was the brightest and had the longest afterglow (which helped disguise the low refresh rates). Heck, if you’ve been doing web design or development for a while, you p…</span>

When Evernote launched the idea of an online notebook as a sort of &quot;second brain&quot; more than a decade ago, it resonated so much with what I had been trying to achieve for a while. By then I already had tons of bookmarks, text files with read-it-later links, notes I had taken across multiple devices, sketches I had taken on physical paper and drafts of articles or papers I was working on. All of this content used to be sparse across many devices, it was painful to sync, and then Evernote came like water in a desert.
I have been a happy Evernote user until ~5-6 years ago, when I realized that the company had run out of ideas, and I could no longer compromise with its decisions. If Evernote was supposed to be my second brain then it should have been very s…</span>

                    <span>And to be precise, from my past self.
I wrote this letter precisely a year ago, as a gift to myself.

There were some things I could not have envisioned and some things I was absolutely right about.
Let&#x27;s go through this together, shall we?
... reading my letter ...
It&#x27;s funny. I start with wanting to spend more time in nature, and I hope my past self is glad to hear we actually did spend a lot more time in nature and offline.
The big thing about the time when writing this letter was the travel bans, and one year later, we still have a lot of travel bans in place.
But needless to say, I&#x27;m writing this today from a tropical island, on which ironically enough, we got stuck 😂.
My wedding was the most beautiful day. It was exactly as I would have envisioned it, heck, even better.

Why system design for Front-End?
Front-End is getting complex day by day.The line between Backend and Front-End is fading out. As well as, it is expected that Front-End should contribute to the design decisions of the project. Front-End developers should flag in the design meetings if Backend/APIs folks are ignoring any important aspect in the design.
What interviewers are looking for?
As a Front-End developer do you understand
How the application should be designed E2E?


What are the important parts of any application?


Do you understand which resource is the right fit and why


Do you understand the pros-cons of the design decisions

Hello Devs, if you want to learn Microsoft Azure in 2022 and looking for the best resources like online courses, books, tutorials, etc then you have come to the right place. 
Earlier, I have shared the best cloud computing courses and best free Azure courses but many of you asked for more comprehensive and in-depth Azure courses and here we are with the list of the 5 best Microsoft Azure courses in 2022.  
Microsoft Azure is, as the name implies, Microsoft&#x27;s answer to Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. What that means is that it provides a wide range of cloud services like computing, storage, analytics, and networking…</span>

Let&#x27;s start by creating an SST app.
$ npx create-serverless-stack@latest rest-api
$ cd rest-api

By default our app will be deployed to an environment (or stage) called dev and the us-east-1 AWS region. This can be changed in the sst.json in your project root.

                    <span>Today, I got feedback from a code review and learned something new. It was about &quot;magic numbers&quot;, which are unique values with unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could (preferably) be replaced with named constants.
I&#x27;ve known about the concept of using constants rather than hard-coding values, but I didn&#x27;t think of that for &quot;magic number&quot; situations. It&#x27;s a pretty simple concept but I just wanted to share what I learned.

                    <span>A Progressive Web App requires a web app manifest, a JSON file that contains the details of your app (things like the name and icons of your PWA). 
An app manifest must have an array of icons. Each of these icons has a purpose set to either monochrome, any ormaskable or a combination of these three values.
Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a few PWA app manifests displaying a warning that until mid-2021 didn&#x27;t exist (those created with Progressier always work great though!): 
Declaring an icon with purpose &quot;any maskable&quot; is discouraged. It is likely to look incorrect on some platforms due to too much or too little padding.

We expose a single class Copy_With_Style that can be instantiated as follows in client side Javascript. For example:
const clipboard &#x3D; new Copy_With_Style({ button: document.getElementById(&quot;button_to_copy&quot;),

                    <span>CSS variables, also known as custom properties(official name) or cascading variables, are a useful CSS feature that allows you to set a value once and reference it many times throughout an HTML document. As with other programming languages, variables are a valuable tool that helps reduce redundant tasks and hold values that can be used or changed later. CSS variables were introduced in 2016 with the release of Chrome 49, and are now supported across all modern web browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer.
It will make writing and maintaining your CSS easier. Most websites have a color palette that is repeated throughout. Now imagine you have a website and want to change the color palette. In a complex website you&#x27;d have to update the colors in the many places it&#x27;s used. That is a t…</span>

                    <span>Greetings, everyone!
Just like every Tuesday, I had to go out for my physical therapy session, so I couldn&#x27;t work as much today. However, I still managed to get a decent amount of work done on my company webpage such as adding alternative contact methods in case the message form doesn&#x27;t work and adding a hover overlay on the portfolio project images that says &quot;View Project.&quot;


Anyway, let&#x27;s move on to my daily report!
I passed my Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam and got certified. Also, I planned out the work I&#x27;ll be doing for this week, mostly regarding the business page.
I added call-to-action for alternative contact methods, specifically email and phone number, if ever the contact form doesn&#x27;t work.
I placed a hover overlay on top of the portfolio project images.
read some articles about Scrum, particularly about the role expectations in an organization, as well as other people&#x27;s experiences of being a Developer and Scrum Master at the same time.
Thank you for reading! Have a good day!

How do you manage being a Scrum Master and Developer at the same time?
What can I expect my Scrum Master to do?

由美国德克萨斯儿童医院和贝勒医学院的研究人员开发的新型新冠疫苗 Corbevax，正以无专利约束的形式提供给世界各地的疫苗制造商。人体试验证明该疫苗安全有效，印度已批准使用该疫苗，使该国的疫苗产量增加到每月超过 1 亿剂。该疫苗使用了一种传统的基于蛋白质的技术，这种技术已安全使用几十年，一直被用于生产乙型肝炎疫苗。该疫苗甚至比阿斯利康 Covishield 疫苗更好，对 Delta 变体有效性至少为 80%。


老王点评：或许这不是最有效的疫苗，但是更重要的是，它一个免专利的、可以让所有疫苗厂商生产制造的疫苗。




AI 的 6 种劣化情况

AI 专家称，不需要恶毒的独裁者，AI 就可能会自然而然地出现 6 种劣化情况，这包括：深度伪造等技术用虚假替代了现实；忽视了数据安全和对社会造成的危害；被用来进行监控和跟踪；算法定义了人类所接受的信息；AI 自身的局限性和偏见造成的限制；过度监管限制了 AI 带来的好处。


老王点评：我觉得这些能认识到的问题其实都还属于可以解决的问题，倒也不必杞人忧天。




哈勃太空望远镜已运行超 10 亿秒

虽然詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜已经开始了它的漫长部署过程，但 1990 年 4 月 25 日从发现号航天飞机的货舱中展开的哈珀望远镜已经运行 31 年多了。这台望远镜在2021 年 1 月 1 日超过了 10 亿秒大关，目前已经进行了超过 150 万次的科学观测。哈珀望远镜的设计寿命是 15 年寿命，虽然不大可能再运行 10 亿秒了，但是 NASA 希望它还可以坚持几年。


老王点评：缝缝补补又三年，这几年 NASA 为了让它恢复工作，简直是操尽了心。</span>

                    <span>英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中引入一个特殊的变化，可以在不重启系统的情况下更新系统固件。




去年发现的几个安全漏洞，使得系统管理员很难在不停机的情况下迅速修补系统。

如果能做出一些改进，在不重启系统的情况下更新一些关键组件以提高安全/性能呢？

英特尔旨在通过其新的 PFRUT（平台固件运行时更新和遥测Platform Firmware Runtime Update and Telemetry）驱动程序来实现这一目标。

英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中提供 PFRUT

虽然 Linux 内核 5.16 将在本周晚些时候发布，不过英特尔的目标是将这一新的功能合并到即将发布的 Linux 内核 5.17 稳定版。

但是，它究竟是什么？

有了 PFRUT 驱动，特定组件（或系统固件）可以在系统运行时进行更新，而不需要重新启动。

最初，英特尔倾向于将其称为“无缝更新”解决方案。然而，随着最近被添加到 Linux 电源管理的 linux-next 分支中的 Linux 内核提交，他们可能会继续使用一个厂商中立的名字，即 pfrut_driver。

顺便说一句，linux-next 分支代表着这些变化将进入下一个 Linux 内核稳定版（5.17）。

在技术上，这个 提交 对该变化的解释如下：


用户应该提供 EFI 封包，并通过将该封包写入设备的特殊文件以将其传递给驱动程序。驱动程序在特定的 ACPI 平台固件运行时更新ACPI Platform Firmware Runtime Update设备（INTC1080）的 ACPI _DSM 方法的帮助下，将封包传输到平台固件，而实际的固件更新是由平台固件中的低级管理模式代码进行的。


就像人们通常期望的那样，这应该可以消除停机时间，可以对解决任何安全和性能改进的固件进行基本更新。而且，系统固件更新可以很容易地直接通过操作系统（这里是 Linux）进行。

正如其中一个 详细说明其工作原理的 PDF 文件 中强调的那样，驱动程序的遥测部分是为了 “从 MM 中检索日志信息，以进行监控并找出问题的根本原因”。

请注意，这只有在 Linux 系统和英特尔芯片上才能实现。

考虑到当你需要修补系统固件以抵御安全问题时，等待系统上的任务完成不是一种理想状况，这种能力的增加应该是非常方便的。

这是为 Linux 桌面或服务器准备的吗？

该改进主要是为服务器专用硬件量身定做的。

英特尔的官方文件指出，这是为具有高服务水平协议（SLA）的系统准备的，这种 SLA 需要尽量减少重启。

然而，这对拥有企业级系统的特定桌面用户群应该也是有用的。

虽然这可能不是桌面 Linux 发行版必不可少的东西，但它可能是改善用户体验的一个令人兴奋的开始。特别是对于热衷于保持系统固件更新而不严重干扰其工作的用户。

这也应该可以引入更多类型的更新的可能性，当涉及到 BIOS 或 UEFI 时，可以由操作系统而不是主板处理。

这不仅限于为你的桌面配置服务器级别的硬件的 Linux 桌面用户。

虽然目前只限于 Linux 系统，但这也应该很快可以用于 Windows 和其他操作系统。

你对英特尔推出的这一变化有何看法？你认为这是对系统固件更新处理方式的一个重大改进吗？

欢迎在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

                    <span>这组文章展示了企业如何与开源软件连接。




开源软件不仅仅创造了专有软件的替代品。在商业方面，开源已经成为一个“力量的倍增器”来改变组织的经营方式。同时，越来越多的公司开始采用更多的开源方法，甚至在管理团队和流程方面。

在过去的一年里，我们发表了许多优秀的文章，展示了企业如何与开源软件相联系。以下是一些阅读量最大的文章：

《开源给你带来竞争优势的 4 种方式》

为了在当今快节奏的世界中取得成功，企业必须对数字解决方案进行明智的投资，使他们能够更快地行动并提高运营的灵活性。这正是越来越多的各种规模和各种行业的组织拥抱开源解决方案的原因。根据麦肯锡的一份报告，开源的采用是表现优异的组织的最大差异化因素。Jason Blais 写了采用开源技术可以帮助组织推动竞争优势和体验更好的业务成果的 四个原因。

《为什么 Crate.io 回归其纯粹的开源根源》

开源技术提供企业级的可扩展性、性能、安全性和可靠性。信任就在那里，而且是当之无愧的。但除了顽固的开源信徒之外，较少被人称道的是日常社区贡献的内部运作，在原子级别建立了这些宏观利益。对于那些提供开源技术的人来说，社区不断的用户驱动的测试和加固将这些技术锻造成强大和成熟的解决方案。Crate.io 的联合创始人 Bernd Dorn 写道，该组织从“开放核心” 转变 为采用 Apache 2.0 许可的纯开源。

《为什么非营利组织选择开源软件》

随着科技和数据安全意识的提高，开源软件比以往任何时候都更成为各阶层组织的首选。非营利组织在财务方面尤其脆弱，同时又要处理重要的社会和环境问题。Michael Korotaev 以 Nextcloud 和 ONLYOFFICE为 例，写了关于在非营利组织中 采用开源协作技术 的文章。

《管理开源产品路线图》

客户，以及与他们交谈的销售和营销团队，都喜欢一个路线图。它让他们了解什么是现实的，什么是不现实的。路线图也是一个产品的核心。Scott McCarty 写了关于 管理开源产品路线图 的文章，以及为什么专有产品的路线图与建立在开源供应链上的产品没有什么不同。产品经理与客户交谈，对他们的需求进行排序，制定路线图，然后找出如何通过建设、购买和合作来提供能力。

《将开源产品推向市场》

产品营销和计划中的信息传递的作用对于一个成功的发布至关重要。Scott McCarty 继续他关于开源供应链中的产品管理的系列文章，讨论了 开源和产品营销的交叉点。

                    <span>市面上常见的摄像头悬浮窗，如微信、手机QQ的视频通话功能，有如下特点：
整屏页面能切换到一个小的悬浮窗
悬浮窗能运行在其他app上方
悬浮窗能跳回整屏页面，并且悬浮窗消失
我们探讨过用CameraX打开摄像头预览，结合可改变大小和浮动的activity，实现了应用内摄像头预览悬浮Activity。这个悬浮Activity是在应用内使用的。要让悬浮窗在其他app上，需要结合悬浮窗 System Alert Window。
本文用CameraX实现摄像头预览悬浮窗，能显示在其他app上方，可拖动，可跳回activity。

这个例子的相关代码放进了单独的模块。使用时注意gradle里的细微差别。

                    <span>1.1.1.  什么是点击防抖？
  在应用日常使用过程中，短时间内超过一次点击某个按钮会触发多次这个按钮的后续逻辑代码运行，这时加入某些手段屏蔽掉除第一次以外的点击事件去重复触发逻辑的控制称为点击防抖。
1.1.2.  为什么需要添加点击防抖?
  正如上面介绍的，在没有添加点击防抖的情况下短时间内多次点击某按钮会多次触发相关逻辑，比如多次打开某个页面，多次提交某些网络请求等等，这些通常不是我们所期望的，而且有些逻辑多次触发也有可能引起程序卡顿、数据异常、应用崩溃等问题。
  综上所述，我们在某些场景下是需要添加点击防抖的，以此来进行限制用户有意或无意的短时间内频繁点击按钮的操作，来规避由此产生的期望外的运行结果。
1.1.3.  点击防抖的间隔
  点击防抖的间隔是否越长越好呢？当然不是，过长的点击防抖间隔会给用户造成按钮点击无效的感觉，通常点击防抖的间隔不宜大于500ms。
  点击防抖的间隔是否越短越好呢？当然也不是，间隔过短，点击防抖也就失去了意义，点击防抖本身的意义就是通过屏蔽短时间的连续点击来规避异常逻辑，如果点击防抖间隔过短，那这个设置本身就失去了他自身的意义。通常点击防抖的间隔应大于100ms。
  综上所述，通常情况下点击防抖间隔应取100ms到500ms之间，但是这个值并非固定值，需要根据实际的业务场景进行调整，一般原则是和你的点击事件处理逻辑时间成正比，逻辑处理时间越长，则点击间隔应该越长，逻辑处理时间越短，则点击间隔应该尽量短。比如点击逻辑是打开页面，这个逻辑只有100ms，则点击间隔应该尽量短，比如点击逻辑是打开蓝牙，这个逻辑有800ms，则点击间隔就需要适量增加。

1.1.4.  是否所有点击都需要点击防抖？
  并不是，通常我们需要添加点击防抖都是根据实际业务去填加，并不建议所有按钮都统一添加，这是因为有很多按钮都是实时操作的，如果添加了点…</span>

                    <span>写在前面
老实说这篇年终总结一开始写得并不顺利，一直没有什么好的思路。
简单回忆了一下 2021 年经历的几件大事：跳槽、离职旅行、搬家、爷爷去世。现在心境相比 2021 年初已经有了很大的改变，可能这就是所谓的「成长」吧。
这次打算用「重新认识自己」——「继续热爱生活」——「做自己」——「变优秀」——「学会和自己和解」来组成这篇年终总结。
重新认识自己
工作
在 2021 年的 6 月我结束了毕业后的第一份工作，选择从国企离职，进入了一家互联网公司。国企与互联网带给我的工作体验是完全不一样的，详情写在了这里：从国企到互联网，一个初入职场将近一年半工作经验程序员的「得」与「失」。
但在新公司待了快半年，意识到其实自己也不喜欢现在的这份工作。因为带自己的 mentor 被裁，导致自己平时工作遇到难点几乎找不到同事寻求帮助，一而再地受到打击，得不到工作上的成就感，渐渐地自己开始厌倦现在这份工作以及这个职业。其实自己也知道，又有多少人真正喜欢工作呢，打工还不是为了混口饭吃。但是我觉得自己还年轻，还想多尝试尝试。
想起来之前和一位朋友讨论过职业规划的问题，我觉得大部分人没有一定阅历是规划不出什么的，因为不知道自己真正喜欢的是什么，但是不规划怎么又能有丰富的阅历做支撑呢。我觉得这是一个悖论，唯一的解决方法是有一个你信得过且对你很了解的前辈告诉你应该选什么方向做什么类型的工作，但是这样就不是自己的人生了。
比如我之前在国企，做的是 ToG 相关的工作，经历过后发现一点也不喜欢条条框框的限制。现在在一家互联网公司做内部系统开发，氛围很自由，只是当前的工作内容并不太喜欢。
但依然没有想好自己真正想做什么，可能还是不敢勇敢迈出那一步吧。还需要多找些行业前辈进行交流与请教，过来人的经验真的很有用。最近和一位做产品的朋友交流，意识到各行各业都没有外人看上去那么光鲜亮丽，不要抱有太高的期望，结果往…</span>

2020年一月，一场疫情将人类社会冻结。工作冻结、生活冻结。人们被关在家里没法出门，也不能参与到工作当中。也正是因为这样，催生出了「远程办公」这样的模式，让一直不被大家重视的「协同办公」走到了历史的舞台最前方，展现出了不一样的魅力。
传统的协同办公，自然要提到 Google Workspace 这个远程协同办公的老大哥。在日本的公司里，经常需要讨论教案或者上课的一些新方法，有些时候需要整理成文档。公司有订阅 Workspace ，所以我们都在其上面讨论或者通过文档来交流对于教案的看法。
同样因为疫情受到影响的，还有我们上课的流程。以往都是线下面授课，疫情期间全部改为用 Zoom 给学生上网课，这个时候就涉及到了板书问题。线下可以写在白板上，线上怎么办呢？在使用飞书以前，我的解决办法是用 iPad 加入会议，然后再用 iPad 来共享屏幕进行板书。这样确实很方便，却也存在一个不可调和的问题——画面同步差到极致。往往一个流畅的书写过程被卡顿的屏幕共享硬生生切成了三个分解动作；往后流畅地翻页被其分解成了 PPT 没有过度特效的翻页。
总之，一切的一切，都迫使我停止使用 iPad 来作为板书工具，并且急需一个替代品。这个代替品既能起到「板书」的作用，同时还能兼顾 PDF 阅读器的职能。最好还能在 PDF 文件上做标记。
开始尝试使用飞书
需求有了，接下来就是对比市面上的产品了。学生年龄在初中阶段，用 Coda 或者 Worspace 不太合适，他们可能并没有太多精力去研究这两个东西到底怎么用；用 Notion 的话导入 PDF 又非常不便； iPad 更是不再考虑，它最多只能作为一个辅助性的工具。
找到飞书是个巧合，完全是在研究工作流的时候碰到了飞书，并且被这个远程办公的模式启发，觉得可以用在我的课堂上。说干就干，于是我从本地将我目前保留的教案全…</span>

                    <span>使用场景
一年之计在于春。元旦已过，新春将至，是时候投入到新一年的规划中。为此，不妨用些可量化的方式提醒时光易逝，激励自己珍惜时间——比如不时算算「今年过去了百分之几」。
当然，这么简单的问题并不需要依赖那些营销号帮我们做算术；利用自带的快捷指令，完全可以做到随手查看年度百分比，顺便还能画出一个「年度进度条」。
使用步骤
下载：年度百分比
下载后直接运行即可。你也可以直接说「嘿 Siri，年度百分比」来运行。

制作思路
如上所述，这个快捷指令要解决的问题并不困难，但问题是很容易做得繁琐。加上快捷指令的操作至今不算特别方便，如果思路不清晰，很容易在步骤堆积之后手忙脚乱。
为此，我们首先根据预期的输出结果——年度百分比和年度进度条——对该快捷指令所需的功能进行分解，可以大致拆分出如下问题：

如何获取当前日期与年初的天数差值；
如何计算已经过天数占全年天数的百分比，进而转化为进度条；
如何汇总和输出结果。

下面分别介绍本快捷指令的解决思路。
如何获取当前日期与年初的天数差值
对于这个问题，最简单粗暴的方法当然是获取当前日期、构造一个当年 1 月 1 日的日期，然后用「获取时长」的步骤求差值。但以上三步其实可以通过一步来实现。这里的技巧在于，快捷指令中的日期变量都是可以自行指定格式的，并且可以在格式表述中将特定的日期部件改为固定值。
具体而言，我们将「获取时长」步骤的前后两个空位都选为「当前日期」。然后，选择前一个日期（起始日期），将其「日期格式」改为「自定」，然后在下方输入yyyy-01-01。其中，yyyy 是 ISO-8601 标准下的「年」变量，这种格式意味着所得结果的年份随实际年份而变，但月和日则固定为 1 月 1 日。后一个日期（结束日期）保持不变，即输出当前的年月日。
这样一来，这个「获取时长」步骤的输出结果直接就是今天与年初的天数差值。

如何绘制进度条

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人：
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

自我介绍环节
大家好，我是 214，一名自由摄影师。我已经发表的作品有《晚风》《下河》和《离婚之后》等，目前还在继续拍摄新的照片和项目。

分享一件你印象最深刻的、关于 2021 年的记忆吧
我奶奶过世。
你过去的一年你最长待的一个城市在哪里？你在这个地方有发生一些什么故事和经历吗？
我最近住在贵州的关岭，但是我想推荐贵州的紫云县，它是一个宗教气氛比较浓的地方。它处于贵州比较罕见的地震带上，所以它的喀斯特的地貌就会非常的明显。我和张文心去了很多次紫云，那里有很多原始的山洞，没有人工的灯光，很好玩、很有趣，如果有机会大家可以去一下。
如果让你用一个词概括自己的 2021 年，你会用什么词？
懒吧，我今年比较懒。
谈谈你的年度照片吧
也不能说它是年度照片，但是看这个问题之后，我就想到了这张。照片里那个西瓜是我给他们，因为买了没有吃完，所以正好他们在旁边洗澡，说给他们分一点，他们就拿去分给其他的小伙伴吃。

谈谈你的你的年度的书籍、电影或者音乐吧
书的话推荐汪曾祺的小说；电影我推荐《灵媒》和《南巫》。这两部都挺不错，一个是纯粹的恐怖片，一个则带一点社会议题，它们的影像的呈现方式和我之前拍过的一些照片非常像；音乐我推荐 Kanye West 的新专辑。

推荐一个你的年度好物
我买的新电脑 MacBook Air。我以前的电脑连我现在用 A7R4 拍的 RAW 都处理不了，打不开。PS 点开以后要等半小时，很痛苦。新电脑很顺畅，节约了很多时间。
展望一下你的 2022 年吧
2022 年我要出一本新书。我把我以前拍的照片整合了一下，做成一本书，它和《下河》《晚风》不太一样，它更加随机，更像我生活中的那种随手拍，不以项目或者系列为前提。但是我想了一个线索，把它们整合起来，做成一本书。

这个冬天，我从居住了快一年的大理动身回到了东南老家。因为原定的日程被疫情打断，于是在家要待的时长比起计划来要多出很久。我想不如趁着这个机会，来给老家的孩子们上一些课吧。联络了几位在老家教书的同学，成功招募到了五位基础很棒的小学生，定好时间来参加训练。又有在香港的师妹帮我召集了五位正在念 IB 课程的初中生，约定时间上远程课。
「讲课」之类的事情，我在各种不同的场景里都做过。年轻的时候去北大找朋友们玩，可以随便找个空教室借黑板粉笔一用，大谈例如三国吴时的鼓吹曲之类话题。后来落拓江湖，有时候合作方也会带着一些 MBA 学员，来体验一次「设计入门」。这一类的讲课都是对着成年人，想讲什么就讲什么，无需顾虑正误。但这次是给孩子们上课，这样子随随便便可不行。因此，哪怕是两手空空，既无教室，又无专门的设备，也还是得想法子解决才行。一番折腾，其中体验突然让我觉得很有趣，于是写成本文。由于这个课程的地点时常变动，我把它叫做游牧教室。
这篇文章跟之前介绍「学问入门课」的系列不同，着重记述一点实际动手的体验，尤其希望能够帮助到读者当中为人父母或老师的诸位。
我所知道的那些上课方法
世界上有许多种上课的方法，有时候相差极大。比如说习惯了学校——教室、老师——黑板(或投影屏幕）这种配置的人，就很难想象到《星球大战》电影当中尤达大师到底是怎样教导卢克·天行者原力的奥秘与技巧的，既没有教科书（或者说明书），又没有思维导图（拆书稿、大纲），甚至连口头指导都只有寥寥无几的几句话（还是倒装的，这些话）。上述两位都是「绝地武士」，他们的古老对手「西斯」其实也差不多。在…</span>

靠着长达一年的马屁，我成了导师的得意门生。
谁料，我却在庆功宴上喝多，当众亲了他儿子。
1.
我的研究生导师，是业界响当当的大牛。
一年多的鞍前马后，我终于成了他的“得意门生”。
但就在一场庆功宴上，我喝高了。
“明教授，有这样的成果全仰仗您的指导，您就是我再生父亲。啊不，亲爸爸。”
导师也喝了不少，没和我计较。
所以晕晕乎乎的我转向了他一旁安静吃菜的儿子：“明奕。”
对方诧异地转过头挑了挑眉。
“得空多替我谢谢咱爸。”
此话一出，四座皆惊。
只有当事人仍然淡定，轻轻一笑，微点了点头。
然后，我一时忘形，俯下身捧着他的脸吻了上去。
第二天早上，头脑仍有些昏昏沉沉的我打开微信，看到置顶消息顿时清醒：
“唐倩，解释一下昨天晚上跟我儿子的事情。”
我心凉了。
老师，我说我馋他很久了，会被您开除吗？
2.
在这次社死之前，我发誓，我原本的形象一直都是内向文静的。
直到遇到明奕才破了功。
一年前那场沉闷尴尬的破冰宴，在他到来的一刻全然变了景象。
“各位别客气，全部由明教授买单。”
我原本正扮隐形人，手里却莫名被塞了一份菜单。
“学妹喜欢吃什么啊？这个虾怎么样？”这个剑眉星目的浓颜帅哥自来熟得仿佛小区相亲角的大妈。
“都，都行。”
我向来都不擅长跟陌生人交际，瞬间红了脸。
他自问自答着在我身边落座，又去招呼其他人，靠着无比强大的社交技能带动了全场的氛围。
后来，我们甚至互相敬起了酒。
3.
饭后玩真心话大冒险时，我比先前放松了不少，但抽中“亲在场任意异性一口”还是原地石化。
周围人看到我瞬间面色又变得通红，愈发来了劲，起哄催我抓紧。
“我豁出去了。”明奕伸手点了点我肩膀，微微一笑，“我不跟你们导师，多半见不到，不怕尴尬。”
“快快快亲一个！”
于是，我眼睛一闭，横下心，嘴唇在他脸颊一侧轻轻一印。
接近他的那一刻，鼻端被一阵似有似无的薄荷香气萦绕。只是短短的一瞬，却好像在分开…</span>

                    <span>We are living in the midst of the great resignation. More people are actively transitioning out of careers and into new fields now than perhaps at any other time in recent memory.
A lot of those people are choosing software as their next career. You may even be among them.
Why software?
There is a myriad of reasons why people choose to enter software development:
The joy of creating things from scratch
The thrill of problem solving
The lifelong journey of continuing education
and...
There is a lot of money to be made in the field.

Data from 2018 already showed that the average software developer earned 3 times more than other working individuals in the United States.
Yet, entering software as a second career developer can often be overwhelming and intimidating.

The hyperautomation playbook yields benefits for enterprise leaders in the year ahead. This strategy seeks to rapidly identify, vet and automate as many processes as possible.
In the world of software development, there&#x27;s a lot of discussion about automation. Automated workflows impact so many different parts of the software development life cycle — CI/CD pipelines, testing, code suggestions, code scaffolding, and even writing documentation.

                    <span>Introduction


When you code in a Django web framework, we all know that you won’t directly work with databases. There is an ORM (Object relational mapping) who will interact with database using migration and SQL operation. So, I want in this tutorial to show you how to implement an ORM manager from scratch.
Object–relational mapping (ORM) in computer science is a technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages in order to create virtual database objects.
Python is a programming language that enables you to design freely anything that you want.
And honestly I was able to implement a Mini ORM manager merely within 3 hours.

If you do software-as-a-service development and you have paying customers, you at some point learn about the need for operational monitoring and observability. Personally, I went through a process something like this:
Service has some basic logging and an uptime alert.
Service has a health-check endpoint, is deployed in triplicate behind a load balancer.
Logs are real-time shipped to Splunk / ELK Stack.
Metrics set up in Datadog / Prometheus with paging.
Distributed Tracing set up for debugging across services.
And so on.
Each step requires more work to set up and has some additional benefits. I moved through each step by necessity as my service handled more requests and became more important to customers.

                    <span>DragonRuby Game Toolkit (DRGTK) is a 2D game engine built with mRuby, SDL, and LLVM. It&#x27;s meant to be tiny, fast, and allow you to turn out games quickly using Ruby.
Unfortunately, since the documentation is focused on making games quickly, I sometimes get lost when trying to figure out how to do things that should be simple. DragonRuby seems to have borrowed Perl&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s more than one way to do it&quot; philosophy because for anything you want to do with the API there are several ways to do it.
The documentation and examples tend to focus on the simplest forms (which is fine) but then require digging and experimentation to figure out the rest.
To help explain/document the different API options, this post will go through different methods of rendering images (well, rectangles mostly).

setInterval() repeatedly calls a function with a fixed time delay between each call. So you can utilize to do something like I mentioned above (producing x amount of resources every x seconds) or for animations!

                    <span>React fragments were a feature released in React 16.2. They have been around for a while now but have been a relatively lesser used feature. Let us explore the what and why the feature exists.
React fragments are a syntax addition to React that allow wrapping or grouping of multiple HTML elements without the need for any additional DOM nodes. We mostly come across this situation when a React component needs to return multiple elements.
The traditional approach has been to wrap them in a div element because a React component can return only one element. This behavior results in useless additional markup and also makes the DOM tree heavy with additional layers of divs.
The traditional solution to render 3 child components in a single component would have been:
const App &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (

In the previous article, we have already created an Azure App service instance. And now you are able to see the Microsoft Azure default page by the link. This time we are going to migrate Strapi app, Next.js app and Mongo DB to Azure. 
Your project probably has specific environment variables. They should be added to Azure.
Go to the Azure App service instance, find the Configuration in the Settings tab, select Application Settings section.


Here are two kinds of it. Application Settings and Connection Strings. There is only one case for using strings instead of settings, more detailed information can be found by the link. Use Application settings and click on +New application setting.

Some examples include: streaming ETL, real-time analytics, fraud detection, API microservices integration, fraud detection activity tracking, real-time inventory and recommendations, and click-stream, log file, and IoT device analysis.
Streaming data architectures are built on five core constructs: data sources, stream ingestion, stream storage, stream processing, and destinations.

Hello👋 Its Rohan Kadam😊
Maybe you are a newbie to coding👩‍💻 or programming, maybe experienced👴 or maybe a FrontEnd Developer or BackEnd Developer you all have may have come across the word Design Pattern as a principle or as a concept. The design pattern is a way or approach to writing code or developing an application. In this article, we try to answer certain questions What is Design Pattern? Why implement a design pattern? How to implement a Design pattern (Factory)?

Design patterns are the solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-fabricated blueprints that we can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
They are not pieces of code or libraries that can be imported and used in the development of software or …</span>

                    <span>What are the most important unsupervised machine learning algorithms?


In this blog post, we will list what we believe to be the top 8. 
Unsupervised machine learning means that there is no predefined outcome or label for any data point during training. Without a labeled data set, how does one know which algorithm should be used? There are many possible answers to this question and it all depends on the type of problem you need to solve.
The goal of this blog post is to help you figure out which unsupervised machine learning algorithm is best for your problem. We will provide a brief overview and examples as well as details about which algorithms are better suited for specific types of data sets.
Top unsupervised machine learning algorithms include:

                    <span>Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that deals with the study of computational algorithms and statistical models to perform tasks through patterns and interference instead of explicit tasks. The machine (Your computer) takes in the data and algorithm, learns from it, and then could use it to predict for other new instances. Machine learning is a set of tools used to build models on data that could help predict new types of the same data. Machine learning models are now very popular everywhere. You must have once wondered how Facebook knew that you know someone, or how Spotify got that really cool jam recommended to you. Well, that is machine learning and the same way Facebook could pop up someone you do not know is based on the fact that machine-learning models are not …</span>

This article presents a few commands we can execute inside the Flask Shell that might help us understand the structure and the business logic of a legacy web app. We might need this when we start working on a new project designed or coded in the past or when our own web app is getting bigger.
Thanks for reading! Topics covered:

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Getting started with Flask is pretty easy. Once we have Python3 installed and a modern code editor like VsCode or Atom we can write our first web app.

But nowadays companies need the fastest way to develop native apps. To develop native apps, we must know JAVA for android and SWIFT for ios which waste our time. React native and flutter give us the advantage to write a single code and deploy it to various platforms.
From a single codebase in a flutter, we create natively-compiled apps for mobile and desktop. Google has recently developed cross-platform mobile app development. Dart is the programming language used by flutter. It enables the creation of expressive and flexible user interfaces with native performance.

                    <span>新的插件可以防止从网上复制代码

JetBrains 发布了一个 AntiCopyPaster 开源插件，可以防止复制和粘贴代码。研究人员观察到，虽然“复制和粘贴构成了编写代码的一个重要部分”，但这样做会导致代码维护、安全问题和许可证问题。由于开发者倾向于抄袭，有很多重复的代码在四处飘荡。截至 2017 年，GitHub 上约有 70% 的代码 来自复制的文件。AntiCopyPaster 会监控 IDE 中的粘贴代码，并扫描目标文件中的 Java 方法以找出重复的内容。该插件在粘贴操作后会等待一段时间，以允许对复制的代码进行编辑。只有当克隆的代码没有被改变时，该插件才会继续检查粘贴的片段是否原样复制的代码。


老王点评：看来以后 ICP 程序员难混咯。




阿里巴巴为 Linux 内核调度器提出组平衡器概念

越来越多的组织为了发展云计算等业务而配置他们的服务器在应用程序之间共享 CPU 核心/资源，而不是将某个 CPU 核心专门分配给单个应用程序/任务。阿里巴巴为 Linux 内核调度器提出一个新的“组平衡器”概念，以提升系统资源利用。这个平衡器的重点是在各组 CPU 核心之间平衡各组任务。这是一种缓解共享模式下冲突的方法，使组尽可能地排他，以获得性能和资源效率。在一台 128 核 CPU 服务器上的基准测试发现，与标准共享模式相比，Redis 在组平衡器模式下可以提升 2~10% 的性能。


老王点评：现在越来越多的看到了中国开发者在内核前沿做出更深入的探索和研究。




夸大其词的 CleanCache 补丁将在十年后从 Linux 内核中删除

CleanCache 是由 Oracle 开发的，在推出时他们宣称它是“非常酷的东西，有巨大的潜力超级优化运行的虚拟机的性能，是相当多的研究和实验的结果。”它有可能在许多环境中以可忽略的成本大幅提高许多工作负载的页面缓存效率。十年后的今天，CleanCache 已经没有任何内核代码在使用它们了，因此，它很可能在 Linux 5.17 中 被主线移除。


老王点评：这种新陈代谢挺好，要不 Linux 内核越来越臃肿了。</span>

                    <span>随着最新版本的发布，Pinta 终于带来了视觉上的更新和改进、移植到了 GTK 3 和 .NET 6。




新的一年的一周，你是否正在期待一些最新的开源应用发布。

你很幸运，Pinta 在新年前就宣布了他们的重大升级版本。

Pinta 是一个轻量级的绘画应用，可以作为一个简单的图像编辑工具。作为 顶级开源绘画应用 之一，Pinta 的新版本将其基础转移到 GTK3 和 .NET 6，并带来了一些新的功能和用户界面改进。

它是一个跨平台的开源应用程序，可用于 Linux、Windows 和 MacOS。

让我们来看看 Pinta 2.0 提供了什么。

有什么新变化？



GTK3 移植

如上所述，Pinta 现在已经被移植到了 GTK3，应该可以支持 GTK3 主题。虽然这可能不会带来巨大的变化，但作为一个 Linux 的原生应用程序，肯定会对体验有所改善。

GTK 对话框和小工具也得到了相应的调整。这包括增加了 GTK 字体选择器，取代了旧的文本工具，并使用了平台原生的文件对话框。

用户界面的改进

在用户界面方面，有许多变化和改进。其中一些包括：


使用 HiDPI 显示器的用户或许遇到的问题更少

一些工具现在使用旋转按钮而不是组合框

可以在状态栏上查看位置、缩放和调色板等信息

调色板现在显示最近使用的颜色

使用鼠标中键，你可以轻松地缩放和平移画布

取消了 “插件” 和 “最近打开” 菜单项


如果你使用 macOS，你可以注意到它使用了全局菜单而不是应用程序菜单，使其看起来更干净。

其他改进措施

这个版本还改进了油漆桶、选择工具和魔杖工具的性能，也修复了大量的错误。

Windows 和 macOS 版本也得到了改进和更新。

你可以参考 官方发布说明 了解更多技术细节。

下载 Pinta 2.0

我觉得将 Pinta 移植到 GTK3 的决定会受到用户的欢迎，但由于 GTK 4.0 已经崭露头角，是否有点太晚了？让我们拭目以待。

总的来说，这个版本为用户的桌面外观提供了统一性。Pinta 2.0 看起来是一个做了有益改进的可靠版本。

你可以以 Flatpak、Snap、Tarball 等以及其它用于 Linux 的软件包格式下载 Pinta 2.0。

Windows 和 macOS 用户可以使用各自的安装程序，现在它捆绑了所有必要的依赖，如 GTK 和 .NET / Mono。

                    <span>无论你在寻找什么工具，都有大量的开源软件的替代品供你选择。




2021 年又是一个主要在网上度过的年份，但这对开源世界来说并不新鲜。在任何地方工作的能力是我们的 DNA，在大流行之前，远程工作就已经进入了主流。

然而，今年在屏幕前的所有时间使我们的社区考虑开源的替代方案。无论你需要什么样的工具，许多流行的供应商都不是你唯一的选择。

如果你对 Zoom 感到厌倦，想要一个非 Salesforce 家的 CRM，或者想要一个非谷歌的分析工具，请继续阅读。我们有推荐了 2021 年最受读者喜爱的开源替代品的文章。

我最喜欢的开源项目管理工具

如果你在管理一个项目，可能看起来你有无穷无尽的工具可以选择。随着甘特图跨入敏捷领域，现在更常见的是看到它们被部署在大型项目的服务中。

如果你认为微软 Project 是你唯一的选择，别担心，Frank Bergmann 分享了几个 开源替代品，供单个用户计划和跟踪大型单一项目。Redmine、ProjectLibre 和 TaskJuggler 都是这个列表中涉及的开源替代品。

微软 Exchange 的一个开源替代品

微软 Exchange 在群件中的主导地位可能即将结束。2020年，一位奥地利的开源开发者建立了 grommunio，作为 Exchange 的开源替代品。

在 Markus Feilner 的 对 grommunio 的评论中，他分享了该工具提供的大量功能清单。集成的原生 exchange 协议使 Outlook 和智能手机能够像连接到 Exchange 一样连接到 grommunio。在这个强大的列表中，日历管理、视频会议和会议功能是由 Jitsi 提供的。

                    <span>Java内存模型 &amp; JVM内存分区
线程之间的通信
在命令式编程中，线程之间的通信机制有两种共享内存和消息传递。
共享内存：线程之间通过写-读内存中的公共状态来隐式进行通信，典型的共享内存通信方式就是通过共享对象进行通信。
消息传递：线程之间没有公共状态，线程之间必须通过明确的发送消息来显式进行通信，在java中典型的消息传递方式就是wait()和notify()，notifyAll()。
Java内存模型
Java的并发采用的是共享内存模型，JMM决定一个线程对共享变量的写入何时对另一个线程可见。
JMM(Java Memory Model)是Java虚拟机规范定义的，用来屏蔽掉Java程序在各种不同的硬件和操作系统对内存的访问的差异。
Java虚拟机规范中试图定义一种Java内存模型来屏蔽掉各种硬件和操作系统的内存访问差异。
---《深入理解Java虚拟机》

这组规则是控制程序中各个变量在共享数据区域和私有数据区域的访问方式，围绕原子性，有序性、可见性展开；Java内存模型中规定所有变量都存储在主内存， 主内存是共享内存区域，所有线程都可以访问，但线程对变量的操作(读取赋值等)必须在工作内存中进行;
线程之间的共享变量存储在主内存（main memory）中，每个线程都有一个私有的本地内存（local memory），本地内存中存储了该线程以读/写共享变量的副本。本地内存是JMM的一个抽象概念，并不真实存在。它涵盖了缓存，写缓冲区，寄存器以及其他的硬件和编译器优化。
如何从工作内存同步到主内存之间的实现细节，Java内存模型定义了以下八种操作来完成,而且这8个操作必须是原子性的。
数据同步八大原子操作
lock（锁定）：作用于主内存的变量，把一个变量标识为一条线程独占状态。
unlock（解锁）：作用于主内存变量，把一个处于锁定状态的变量释放出来，释放后的变量才可以…</span>

如果您更喜欢通过视频了解此内容，请 点击此处 查看。
在本文中，您将会学习 Gradle 的 Task、Provider、Property 以及使用 Task 进行输入与输出。同时您也将进一步完善您的插件，并学习如何使用新的 Artifact API 访问各种构建产物。
Property
假设我想要创建一个插件，该插件可以使用 Git 版本自动更新应用清单文件中指定的版本号。为了达到这一目标，我需要为构建添加两个 Task。第一个 Task 会获取 Git 版本，而第二个 Task 将会使用该 Git 版本来更新清单文件。
让我们从创建名为 GitVersionTask 的新任务开始。GitVersionTask 需要继承 DefaultTask，同时实现带有注解的 taskAction 函数。下面是查询 Git 树顶端信息的代码。
abstract class GitVersionTask: DefaultTask() {
   @TaskAction
   fun taskAction(){
       // 这里是获取树版本顶端的代码

前言
之前一篇我们讲了 Flutter组合动画实现的方式 —— 交错动画，如需了解原理的可以查看下面这篇：做出 GIF 图片的效果 —— Flutter 交错动画（Staggered Animation）简介。借助 GIF 和绘图技巧是可以做到类似 GIF 那种效果的。本篇我们来一个应用实例，我们让轮子在草地滚动着前进，而且还能粘上“绿色的草”，运行效果如下动画所示。

动画解析
上面实现的效果实际上有三个动画组成：
轮子前进的动画
轮子滚动
轮子的边缘颜色渐变（由黑色变成绿色）
这三个动画是同时进行的，因此需要使用到交错动画，即使用一个 AnimationController来控制三个 Tween 对象实现上述的动画组合。
编码实现
首先是轮子组件的定义，为了让轮子转动的效果能够看到，我们给轮子填充了线性的渐变色，然后轮子的尺寸、旋转速度（time）和边框颜色由上级组件来控制。整个实现很简单，就是一个加了装饰的 Container 而已。
class Wheel extends StatelessWidget {
  final double size;
  final Color color;
  final double time;
  const Wheel({
    Key? key,
    required this.size,
    required this.time,
    required this.color,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

                    <span>Android资源的含义
Android使用xml文件描述各种资源，包括字符串、颜色、尺寸、主题、布局、甚至是图片（selector，layer-list）
资源可分为两部分
属性
在APK程序中，属性定义在res/values/attrs.xml中，在系统中属性位于framework/base/core/res/res/values/attrs.xml文件中

    
    
    
    


styleable相当于一个属性集合，其在R.java文件中对应一个int[]数组，aapt为styleable中的每个attr（属性）分配一个id值，int[]中的每个id对应着styleable中的每一个attr。
中的Window相当于属性集合的名称。
中的windowBackground相当于属性的名称
属性名称在应用程序范围内必须唯一
如果一个attr后面仅仅有一个name，那么这就是引用；如果不光有name还有format那就是声明。
windowBackground是属性的声明，其不能在其他styleable中再次声明；windowTitle则是属性的引用，其声明是在别的styleable中
值
常见的值一般有以下几种：
String，Color，boolean，int类型：在res/values/xxx.xml文件中指定
Drawable类型：在res/drawable/xxx中指定
layout（布局）：在res/layout/xxx.xml中指定
style（样式）：在res/values/xxx.xml中指定
值的类型大致分为两类，一类是基本类型，一类是引用类型
对于int，boolean等类型在声明属性时使用如下方式：

ArrayMap是谷歌推出的在安卓等设备上用于替代HashMap的数据结构，和HashMap相比，具有更高的内存使用率，因此适合在Android等内存较为紧张的移动设备，下面结合源码分析ArrayMap实现原理，主要分为添加数据、查找数据、删除数据以及缓存四部分，注意本文基于api29。
正文
构造函数
首先先来来康康ArrayMap的构造函数如下：
/** {@hide} */
public ArrayMap(int capacity, boolean identityHashCode) {
    mIdentityHashCode &#x3D; identityHashCode;

    // If this is immutable, use the sentinal EMPTY_IMMUTABLE_INTS
    // instance instead of the usual EmptyArray.INT. The reference
    // is checked later to see if the array is allowed to grow.
    if (capacity 
初始化了两个空数组，其中mHashes是用来升序存放key的hash值，mArrays 是用来存放key和value的，所以的mArrays的长度是mHashes的两倍，key和value是紧挨着存放的，如果将key所对应的hash在mHashes的位置记作为index，key在 mArrays 中的位置记作 keyIndex,value在 mArrays 中的位置记作valueIndex,他们之间有如下关系:
keyIndex &#x3D; index
添加数据
添加数据主要看下put方法,提取部分关键代码如下：
public V put(K key, V value) {

                    <span>前言
我之前在 Newsletter 里分享了用 Craft X Snippets 记录晨间日记的方法，评论区收到一个关于 Daily Notes 如何归档整理的小问题，回复中也思考了一番 Craft 这个应用本身。作为我在过去的一年中最喜爱、又带给我很大帮助的应用，想在新年伊始为它当一回「传教者」，在此展开讲讲，它有哪些特别之处，我为何喜欢它，以及一些使用上的研究和小技巧；当然，也会有它的不足。

Craft 是去年 Apple 评选的 Mac App of the Year，也获得了 Apple Design Award「交互」赛道提名，足以说明它一定有值得称道之处。少数派在 App Store Awards 2021 这篇文章中说它是：

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

是的，Craft 在 2020 年 11 月正式上线，到今天也就差不多一年的工夫。团队的精心打磨，使得它一上线就有着非常高的完成度。而过去一年中又陆续发布了 21 个大更新和 26 个小更新，也就是说，几乎每 2-2.5 周就会有一个大更新。我是从 iOS App Store 推荐知道它的，抱着试一试的态度，拿到手就被教学关近乎完美的动效吸引。在花了一点点时间探索，并看了帮助文档后，知道了很多令人心动的小细节，不免对这个应用心生好感，随即陆续把自己的笔记都搬了过来。
在使用 Craft 的一年里，时不时收到官方发来的「我们又更新了」的邮件，带来许多令人欣喜的 feature（很多时候刚好在想「要是有 xx 功能就好了」，结果真的更新了），并且他们的 更新说明 写得非常漂亮，读起来是一种享受，…</span>

                    <span>跨保读研半年，周围人对我的评价多围绕：理智有计划，做事有条理。但深入追踪我的决策与执行会发现，相比于一个模糊的目标，一个清晰地有符合科学依据的计划更不容易被我执行。
换句话说，我有能力制定一个完美的计划，但产生之后，我不愿意去执行它。
这就很难搞。
然后我发现我会倾向于先有一个清晰的终点目标，然后将实现路径模糊化，保持大方向是对的，剩下就随机碰撞，这样的计划很不完美，很不符合SMART原则和OKP法则，但对我很有效。
同时又产生了另一个问题，实现路径的模糊化很容易带来得过且过、自欺欺人和自我感动，于是又想出了另一个办法，在执行时忠实地记录。
所以记录下这个红黑榜，更多的是面对真实的我，没有自负，也不自我贬低。
完美的对立面不是不完美，而是真实。

看了一些书，并且开始有深度


也犯过急于求成的毛病啊，想标榜自己一年看完很多很多书，再不济也可以做到一周一本。
但我很快发现这样看书很容易让数量掩盖另一些可能性：比如深度，比如多线并开式读书（我看书看累了会换一本书看，但想到一周的时间不够了就会犹豫）。
后来在B站上看【哈佛john】的视频时发现一周一本书还会让自己在选择书籍时倾向于选择一周能读完的书，觉得分析得很透彻，然后就放弃掉追求数量的想法。
还会在自己看书特别快的时候敲一下自己的脑壳，慢下来，贪多嚼不烂。
这样下来我实际看完的书反而比原定计划要多，有些一气呵成的小说（比如《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》）读起来也一气呵成，有些可以碎片化阅读的文字（比如《戴老师的魔性诗词课》）也没花什么专门的功夫就读完了。或许这就是无痛阅读？

                    <span>Pixelmator Photo 在问世之初仅仅是一个图片编辑工具，在浩如烟海的同类 App 中并没有什么竞争的优势。不过，随着 Pixelmator Photo 在更新到 2.0 版本后拥有了全新设计的照片浏览器，而 iPhone 版本也获得了桌面级的图片编辑体验，这样的双重身份让它在我的首屏拥有了一席之地，甚至替代了系统相册的位置，让我在同一个 App 中就可以完成对图片的一站式处理。

宛如原生，「果」味十足
在 2.0 版本中，Pixelmator Photo 的照片浏览器经过了全新的设计，乍一看，和 iOS 系统原生的照片 App 可以说是如出一辙。不管是在第一个标签页「所有照片」还是在第二个标签页「相簿」，很多时候我都分不清自己到底是在使用 Pixelmator Photo 还是照片 App，所以在 UI 设计上 Pixelmator Photo 的照片浏览器做到了和 iOS 系统的高度统一。
上：照片 App；下：Pixelmator Photo。
在交互方面，Pixelmator Photo 也与系统照片 App 有非常多的相似之处：长按图片可以呼出右键菜单，「选择」模式下滑动可以多选图片，双击图片放大/缩小局部……

另外，Pixelmator Photo 可以通过「收藏」按钮将图片添加至「收藏」标签页，用来作为一个筛选机制也是一个不错的用法。

技术不够，AI 来凑
Pixelmator Photo 最大的卖点之一，就是从同门兄弟 Pixelmator Pro 那里继承了很多通过人工智能实现的实用功能。在移动平台上编辑图片，便捷是核心，而这些 AI 技术帮助我们可以在 iPhone 上快速出图。
点击任意图片进入编辑界面，就可以看到不少 AI 技术的身影。首先，右上…</span>

                    <span>想要深入使用 Notion 数据库，函数一定是绕不开的话题。它有点像 Excel 里的公式，根据几个单元格的值计算出一个新值，又有点像一些编程语言。12 月 18 日，theBlock 联合 Notion 中文社区举办了一次「和我一起写函数 • Write Formulas With Me」线上直播活动。我们针对宣传期间的问卷调查结果，期望可以让大家收获一些学习函数的方法和解决问题的思路。如果你错过了直播，那不妨跟随我们的文字版记录，一起探索 Notion 数据库函数吧～
函数可以做什么
在 Notion 数据库中新建一列，将属性类型修改为函数（Formula），点击这一列任意一格就会弹出函数编辑窗口，输入 1+1 然后点击 Done，就完成了一个函数的编写，这一列所有值都会显示为 2。

这就是一个简单的函数，但我们显然不满足于让一列函数只显示相同的结果，因此，我们可以调用这个数据库中其他的属性，作为函数属性的值，只需要用 prop(&quot;属性名称&quot;) 即可。例如在这个水果价格表中，直接用 prop(&quot;单价&quot;) 获得单价属性的值，你也可以直接在函数编辑窗左侧的选项中点击或回车来插入。

既然可以调用其他属性，我们就能用函数来实现一些运算：例如想要获得每种水果的总价，我们知道只需要 单价 * 数量 即可，因此 prop(&quot;单价&quot;) * prop(&quot;数量&quot;) 就能获得每种水果的总价。

这就是一个简单的函数例子，我们对于每一行不同的水果，对不同的单价和数量，用一个相同的函数，得到了每种水果的总价。Notion 数据库中的函数（Formula）就是用相同方法解决多个同类问题。数据库的每一行都是一个独立的问题，但可以用同一个函数解决。不止是数字，文本、日期等等，Notion 中有非常多的函数来解决各种问题。
函数应该怎么写
写好函数，需要遵循一定的语法格式，我们首先来看看函数的组成。…</span>

🍰 Android 13 前瞻

现在聊起 Android 13 更新确实是太早了，毕竟开始大范围推送 Android 12 更新的手机厂商两只手都能数过来，现在就开始聊关于 Android 13 的更新动态可能确实有点 …… 早。
但随着新一年已经到来，下一个 Android 测试版本预计也会在二月至三月期间发布：今年的 Android 12 早在二月初爆出重要渲染图：证实了两个关键更新 —— Material You 主题取色系统以及大改版的桌面小组件系统的存在。甚至还从某种程度上印证了 Pixel 6 的 ID 设计。

即使在首个 Android 12 正式版发布之后这份曝光的可信度都存疑，但如今回顾，这份曝光中的几乎所有新功能都已经在 Android 12 最终正式版中出现。

说回 Android 13：从去年年底开始，我们就看到了来自多个信源的 Android 13 功能曝光：不仅有对于目前 Android 12 锁屏时钟样式的重新设计、还有关于蓝牙音频传输协议的功能加入，在 Android 12 大幅改进原生 UI 之后，Android 13 将重新聚焦于更多功能上的细枝末节。
从来自其中一份曝光来看，Android 13 正在开发一项代号为「Panlingual」的新功能…</span>

                    <span>来自 Matrix 机器人
在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

介绍一下你自己
你好吗！新年快乐！我是熊小默，一个视频创作者和短片导演。

我以前做过杂志主编，呆过互联网公司，发过当艺术家的梦，但目前占据我生活最大块的是旅行和拍摄。我对设计史和摄影史很感兴趣，收藏珍版唱片和机械钟表，我的视频也太多围绕设计、艺术和流行文化展开。
为什么喜欢机械表、怎么想到要做一档关于机械表的视频栏目？
现在很多人把表看作是展现身份的奢侈品，一种阶层符号。但作为一个从初中开始就迷恋钟表的人，我把它看作机械奇迹。时间本身是不可客观度量的，但钟表能把它等块切分，靠的只是齿轮咬合。而在我们人类历史的很长一段时间里，报时的权力属于国王或教会，现代钟表则是把这种权力交还给普通人。

我有一档视频栏目叫《HAND ON》，就是希望以诗歌化的语言，唯美的微观画面，来和大家分享在设计或历史意义上有值得一提之处的腕表。
 
2021 年让你印象深刻的腕表或相关品牌？
有几块风格迥异的腕表我很喜欢：
HUBLOT 和村上隆的新一代合作款。

OMEGA 的多用途计时器超霸 Chronoscope 腕表。

宝珀的 5008D 无辐射版五十噚。

希望通过《拍照的人》系列传达什么样的观点或者思考？
《拍照的人》这组短片是想去纪录全国各地在拍照的年轻人，他们对于摄影有全新的理解，也把它用作不同于以往的表达手段。
  
在系列短片里，我很有意地避开「摄影师」这三个字，因为我不想把拍照这件事塑造成为职业化的，需要特殊训练的，有天赋才艺的人才能做的事。我希望展现拍照这个动作里直觉、本能、生活化的特质。

拍照是每个现代年轻人命中注定的行为，只不过我希望这组短片能给大家一些寻找表达出口的启发。另外，这组短片也是希望密切地和地理发生关系的，能展现主人公和他们的家乡的关联。我们去了黔南、辽西、山西、潮汕地区、黑龙江，就是为了分享这种地理的差异性如何启发拍照。
推荐 3 位你最喜欢的视频博主？
@cbvivi、@苏兆阳Sudo、@flypig。
从眼镜到腕表再到数码产品，你推荐过很多精美有趣的物件，你平时出门会带或者常用哪些装备？
表我肯定会戴，我可以做到连续七周每天换表不重样。
照相机我一般也会带，有拍摄工作时带 FX3，没有工作时我会带徕卡（但是是胶卷相机，而不是那台花了我很多钱的 M10-R black paint，非常让人失望的粗制滥造产品，买来基本没用）。还有润唇膏和耳塞，我基本时时刻刻在听点有的没的。

推荐 3 样你的年度好物，并简单说说理由。
DJI 新出的麦克风，非常好用，我们现在录播客已经全面改用这款无线麦了。

永璞咖啡的榛果味胶囊，我的年度最大发现，便宜好喝香，泡起来很简单。
Astell &amp; Kern 的蓝牙音箱 Acro BE100，很美、很动听，还不贵。

用一个词概括你的 2021 年，为什么？
半空半满。
我今年做了很多让自己骄傲的项目，但是呢，又感觉它们其实本来也在我能力之内，并没有太多进步。
对于新的一年有哪些期待？
希望2022可以学到、看到全新的东西。增加生命体验。

游记：从坏运气开始，在满意中归家
坏运气的依旧
在出发前的一个月，我自己都觉得运气十分差。虽然只是我的感觉，但似乎真的有许多事情都没办法正常完成。往往都是十分难受。于是这俩月我的口头几乎都离不了「运气差」。
许多事情做不成，心情有些低落，加上一段时间没有什么「好消息」光顾，也显得精神上有些疲惫。于是想要出门转运就成了一个合适的借口。
临行前一周，突发高烧。因为肠胃原因发烧，所以还是清醒的，但是难受却也是久违的难受。已经多年没有这样烧过了，不敢去医院，也只能在家养着。加上一直在吃药，饮食方面也有许多忌口，于是这一周也就变得十分煎熬与悲伤。
吃不下东西，也消化不动，除了卧倒休息等待自然好转，似乎也没有任何更好的办法。
出发前三天，终于做了决定定了票。此时一查，余票两张，出不了门的定律要在这里打破——好家伙，买完票又窜回 39 度⋯⋯
心态几近崩溃，甚至已经想直接放弃退票了，毕竟不到 48 小时的出发时限就在那里。
有些时候，下定了决心还是有用的，第二天晚上，恰逢 F1 意大利大奖赛。虽然提起精神来看比赛，但脑子还是顶不住这样的双重折磨。于是早早就躺在了床上，吃了些药睡了下去。
只记得那天晚上有个神奇的梦，感觉手脚都被不同的人管着（黑暗大法师），然后一次次写报告要求控制手脚，跟每个人都交易了某些特定的东西，才让手脚活动起来。于是醒来，已经来到了第二天，12 点出头。我坐在床上稳定了很久，脑子里还是嗡嗡响，仿佛被庞大的信息量塞了个水泄不通⋯⋯毕竟刚才做了那么多的事才把自己的控制权要回来。一看温度计，体温正常了。
此时看着窗外的天空，敲了敲…</span>

                    <span>常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。
 
其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。


Part 1|咨询前
 确认专业资质和能力 

1. 教育经历
 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。
比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。
而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。



国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：

精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；
临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；
学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；
私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。

在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。
2.执业资格
除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。
2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。



但即便有证书，也…</span>

                    <span>众所周知，MOBA游戏网络效应好、社区属性强，自然增长极快。然而其初期推广难、用户累积慢、运营成本高等问题又总是令让众多厂商纷纷折戟。到今天，纵观市场，似乎只有《王者荣耀》和《无尽对决》曾杀出重围，获得人气与价值的双丰收。其他产品却没有这样好的运气了，不管是网易的《决战！平安京》，还是腾讯的《Arena of Valor》，纵使承载着极高期望和投入，却都没能够翻起太大水花，最终也不过是淹没于茫茫游戏之海，被众人所遗忘。

2020年6月，腾讯和Pokemon Company共同宣布联手打造基于宝可梦IP的轻度MOBA手游《宝可梦大集结》，欲二度冲击海外市场。游戏于2021年7月登录Switch平台，同年9月登录移动端平台。令人惊讶的是，本作并没有照搬腾讯天美信手拈来的Dota式核心战斗模式，而是迎合轻度玩家喜好，从诸如《风暴英雄》和《Splatoon 2》的类MOBA游戏中汲取灵感，将游戏的重心，从杀敌推塔，转移到了收集能量、达阵得分上，让MOBA游戏走上了休闲娱乐的全新道路。腾讯希望依赖宝可梦的全球影响力来吸引到IP粉丝/泛用户，逐步扩圈，培养出更大的欧美MOBA玩家市场。那么，此番采用全新玩法与独特画风、针对不同目标用户群的《宝可梦大集结》，有没有帮助腾讯再下一城呢？

从数据来看，上线三个月的《宝可梦大集结》在海外市场的表现可谓是高开低走。在声势浩大的首周发布后，游戏逐步暴露出新用户获取乏力、现有用户流失多、长期付费不如意等问题。这究竟是什么原因呢？本期《庖丁解游》就将为大家解析一下这款游戏：《宝可梦大集结》。


（一）游戏循环：单局对战贯穿始终

《宝可梦大集结》游戏核心循环示意如图，MOBA类游戏的核心循环简单明了，主要以单局对战为基础，在对战—变强—继续对战的链条上衍生诸多其他机制。对《宝可梦大集结》来说，在对战之外，玩家还可以在对战中累计胜场、获得金币，从而…</span>

                    <span>CodeNewbie Challenge 2022 begins on January 31st. Register for Cohort 1 by January 30th.





In early 2020, DEV acquired an incredible, supportive community for early-career software developers and people learning to code called CodeNewbie. 
Since then, we&#x27;ve embarked on many exciting adventures together including two entirely virtual CodeLand conferences and the creation of CodeNewbie Community: the official home of CodeNewbie built on Forem.
In 2021, we relaunched the CodeNewbie Challenge together. This collection of email-based challenges including (&quot;Start Coding&quot;, &quot;Code More&quot;, &quot;Write More&quot;, and &quot;Get a Job&quot;) existed long before DEV and CodeNewbie joined forces, but together, we updated it and added in additional support options and a central hub on CodeNewbie Community. Those who participated benefitted from structure, public accountability, inspiration, and ample learning opportunities to reach their goals.
CodeNewbie Challenge for 2022 (#CNC2022).



#CNC2022 returns on January 31st. This time, we&#x27;re making a few changes, including:
A pre-registration, cohort-based model that allows you to stay in tighter communication with others participating in your chosen challenge
Updated resources
A brand new &quot;Learn in Public&quot; challenge that will give you the guidance you need to turn your technical learning journey into a tool for others
If you want to make a change in your career or coding journey, we highly encourage you to sign up for Cohort 1 of #CNC2022. 
Learn more, pick your challenge, and sign up for Cohort 1 here by January 30th. The challenge officially kicks off on January 31st, 2022. 
Cheers to starting to code, coding more, writing more, getting a job, and learning in public with the CodeNewbie Challenge in 2022 ⭐️</span>

                    <span>Profiling is integral to any code and performance optimization. Any experience and skill in performance optimization that you might already have will not be very useful if you don&#x27;t know where to apply it. Therefore, finding bottlenecks in your applications can help you solve performance issues quickly with very little overall effort.
In this article we will look at the tools and techniques that can help us narrow down our focus and find bottlenecks both for CPU and memory consumption, as well as how to implement easy (almost zero-effort) solutions to performance issues in cases where even well targeted code changes won&#x27;t help anymore.
It&#x27;s good to be lazy when it comes to performance optimization. Instead of trying to figure out which part of a codebase is making an application slow, we c…</span>

This command downloads the jenkins:jdk11 image and runs it, -v create a volume to maintain data persistence, runs the Jenkins in port 8080 with name jenkin-master
Go to http://localhost:8080 to access the Jenkins. You will see below screen

I was interested in this kind of working methods since I heard during my studies (I studied Japanese Studies at University of Vienna) that the Japanese started to develop and use Kanban board, a scheduling system, in the late 1940s to improve their productivity at Toyota.

I liked the idea behind it and soon realized that this is something that companies in Europe (and I guess all over the world) are working with nowadays as well.
When job searching, I kept reading the job title &#x27;Scrum Master&#x27;, so it must be a job itself, I thought. And not because I want to become a Scrum Master myself, but to understand how Scrum…</span>

                    <span>1. Explicitly


Using the square bracket notation. This is probably the most common way of creating an Array.
const arr &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];

Using the ES6 notation you can create a copy of another array. Specially useful in functional programming to avoid side effects (i.e. modifying the original array).
const numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];

const copyOfNumbers &#x3D; [...numbers];

// You can also join 2 arrays into one:
const numbersTwice &#x3D; [...numbers, ...numbers];
// This will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

JavaScript defines an Array constructor that allows you to specify the length of the array. This method is useful if you know how large your array is going to be. Note that the constructor will create an array where all the elements are empty (not undefined).
const emptyArray &#x3D; new Array(5);

console.log(emptyArray);
// [  ]

console.log(emptyArray.length);
// 5

This method accepts an iterator (which can be another array or a set) and creates a new array with the same elements.
const copiedArray &#x3D; Array.from([1, 2, 3]);

This method accepts an unlimited number of parameters that will be used as elements of the new constructed array.
const paramsArray &#x3D; Array.of(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;);</span>

Let us learn the differences between a traditional function and an arrow function expression in JavaScript? If not, then prepare to learn the differences in this article. We will discuss the differences between both and share the pros and cons to help us better understand when is the right time to use one over the other. 

Introduction
Function Expression
Arrow Function Expression
Conclusion
In JavaScript, there are a few ways we can declare a function. One widespread and traditional way is function expressions. We can name our expression whatever we want to, but it&#x27;s recommended to name functions precisely what it is intended to do for best practice. To help prevent confusion later on. 
So how exactly do we accomplish this? Well, let us look at how a function expression is …</span>

The world can be a scary place and more and more companies are beginning to turn to Chaos Engineering to proactively poke and prod their systems and in doing so are improving their reliability and guarding against unexpected failures in production and unplanned downtime. 
During my career I dealt with my fair share of outages, including one that caught me mid-song during a bout of karaoke and far too many that woke me up at 02:00. As the co-founder and CTO at Gremlin, I do my best to make sure no other engineers have to suffer sleepless nights worrying about their product. 
But the question remains, what is Chaos Engineering and where did it come from?

                    <span>Google her yıl düzenlediği I/O etkinliğinde bu sene biz Android geliştiricilerine bir süpriz yaptı. 17-19 Mayıs tarihleri arasında düzenlenen I/O 2017 etkinliğinde Android için yeni bir programlama dilini tanıttı. Bu dil JetBrains firmasının geliştirmiş olduğu Kotlin Programlama dili.Bu dil aynı java gibi JVM (Java Virtual Machine) üzerinde çalışabilen bir dildir. Yani bir defa yaz her platformda çalıştır mantığıyla çalışmaktadır.

                    <span>Execution Context-




Execution context is the environment that enables JavaScript code to execute. It decides which piece of code currently gets access to all the functions, variables and objects used in the code for its execution.
In this the code gets evaluated line by line, variables &amp; objects etc get stored in the Memory heap that are then used during the execution of that piece of code thus forming an environment that enables execution of the JS code.
Call Stack is a data-structure that maintains the list of the functions being called and executed/ the execution context currently being executed by the JavaScript engine.
It follows a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, meaning that the last function called gets to the top of the call stack and once execution is finished, it pops fro…</span>

                    <span>Linux 内核 2021 年成绩总结

Linux 内核的代码仓库已经有 106 万次提交，来自约 24.3 万个不同的作者。源代码树目前由 3,220 万行组成，涉及 74,300 个文件。但仅从单纯的数据上来说，要比往年低一些。在 2021 年只有 7.37 万次提交；而 2020 年提交量为 9.02 万次，上一次低于 7.3 万次提交还要追溯到 2013 年，当时提交量为 7.09 万。2021 年内核增加了 320 万行，删除了 130 万行，也低于 2020 年的 400 万行和 150 万行。不过，从内核贡献者的邮件地址数量来看，2021 年，有 4421 个电子邮件，2020 年有 4603 个，2019 年有 4383 个，都大致相当。


老王点评：之所以数量降低，更多的原因应该是 2021 年只完成了 5 个主要版本，而其它年份往往有 6 个主要版本。主要版本发布会带来大量的代码行数和提交数量变化。




KDE 发布 2022 年路线图

KDE 2021 年的路线图已经顺利完成，现在发布了新的 2022 年路线图：


Wayland 会话争取可以完全取代 X11 会话。

对 Breeze 图标集进行大修。

完善多显示器支持。

15 分钟错误计划修复更多错误，“15 分钟错误”指用户在使用桌面的 15 分钟内容易遇到的小问题。

系统设置区域中的语言和格式页面合二为一。


……等等。


老王点评：相比其它更大更闪亮的变化，我更重视这个 15 分钟错误计划。

                    <span>当你点击 Ubuntu 网站 上的下载按钮时，它会给你几个选项。其中两个分别是 Ubuntu 桌面版和 Ubuntu 服务器版。

这可能会让新用户感到困惑。为什么会有两个（实际上是四个）？应该下载哪一个？Ubuntu 桌面版还是服务器版？它们是一样的吗？有什么区别？



我将解释 Ubuntu 的桌面版和服务器版的区别。我还会解释你应该使用哪个变体。

Ubuntu 桌面版与 Ubuntu 服务器版



要了解 Ubuntu 桌面版和服务器版的区别，你应该了解桌面操作系统和服务器操作系统的区别。

桌面操作系统

桌面电脑Desktop是指个人电脑（PC）。桌面电脑操作系统带有一个图形用户界面，以便用户可以使用鼠标和键盘操作。桌面电脑的主要目的是给你一个系统，可以用来浏览网页、编辑文档、查看/编辑图片和视频、编码和游戏。基本上，就是为个人、终端用户或家庭成员提供了一个通用的计算机。

我在这里使用桌面电脑这个术语，但这并不意味着它不能用于笔记本电脑。桌面电脑是个人电脑的通用术语。

服务器操作系统

另一方面，服务器操作系统是专门为托管网站、应用程序、媒体服务器、数据库等网络服务而打造的。

通常情况下，服务器操作系统不带有图形界面。如果是基于 Linux 的操作系统，你就得通过终端的命令来使用该系统。

这里的好处是，服务器操作系统不需要（浪费）大量的内存和计算能力，因为它们不使用 图形化桌面环境。除此以外，服务器操作系统的软件包配置也不同。

现在你对服务器和桌面的区别有了一些了解，让我们看看 Ubuntu 服务器版和桌面版的区别。

用户界面

Ubuntu 服务器版和桌面版之间最明显的区别是用户界面。

Ubuntu 桌面版的特点是采用 GNOME 桌面环境的图形化用户界面。这使得它在鼠标点击的帮助下更容易使用。

                    <span>Samba 是一种灵活的文件共享工具，它将你可能在组织中运行的所有不同平台结合在一起。




在我接触 Linux 的早期，我是纽约州一个小型学前教育学区的技术总监。我们的技术预算总是捉襟见肘。我们是一个 Windows 2000 活动目录域，但我们的中央服务器磁盘空间有限，而且没有教师的主目录。此外，我们经历过十几次员工电脑硬盘故障。

我正在寻找一种方法，以最小的成本保存员工的工作。这时我发现了 Samba。在那之前，我一直将 Linux 用于内容过滤，不知道我们的 Windows 工作站可以连接到服务器并保存文件备份。

Samba 项目 自 1992 年以来一直存在。当我开始试验这个项目的时候，这个项目已经有 10 年历史了，我对如何配置它一无所知。我买了一本书并阅读了如何实现它，然后我从我们的电脑柜中取出一台旧电脑，购买了一个 300G 的希捷 IDE 驱动器，安装了 Linux，并配置了 Samba。我使用了一个简单的配置，并且它成功了。在向我们的一个 IT 助理展示后，我们部署了这个解决方案。硬盘故障的问题继续存在，但我们的员工不再需要担心失去他们所有的辛苦工作。

Samba 采用 GPL 许可证，并在大多数 Linux 发行版上广泛使用。Samba 有很好的 文档，Fedora 用户可以查阅这份在 Fedora 上配置 Samba 的文档。

在 Linux 上安装 Samba

你可以使用你的发行版的包管理器来安装 Samba。

在 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL、Mageia 和类似的系统上：

$ sudo dnf install samba


在 Debian, Linux Mint 和类似系统上：

$ sudo apt install samba

前言
本来是继续准备再回顾一下View的绘制流程，说到这个都能脱口而出什么onMeasure、onLayout等方法，但是从来没有考虑过这些方法是在什么地方调用的，所以先来看一下这些基本知识。
正文
首先就是从大体上来说一下这几个东西在View绘制流程上关系，其他属性就不用多说，内容太多，我们精简一下，方便后续我们回顾View的绘制流程即可。
大体的架构就是Activity包含Window实例，具体就是PhoneWindow实例，然后PhoneWindow中又拥有DecorView实例，这个在之前事件分发中即说过。
Activity &amp; window &amp; DecorView
这3者的关系其实作为Android开发都非常熟悉了，直接放个图：

ViewRoot
在源码中具体实现是ViewRootImpl类，
//源代码
public final class ViewRootImpl implements ViewParent,
        View.AttachInfo.Callbacks, ThreadedRenderer.DrawCallbacks,
        AttachedSurfaceControl {
    private static final String TAG &#x3D; &quot;ViewRootImpl&quot;;
    private static final boolean DBG &#x3D; false;

这部分代码相当复杂，不过我们发现它是实现ViewParent类的，这个接口有很多熟悉的方法：
public interface ViewParent {
    
    public void requestLayout();
    
    //...

比如requestLayout等等。
这有啥用呢 当我们…</span>

一、Kotlin调用Java
1.1 互操作性与可空性
Java世界里所有对象都是null，当一个Kotlin函数返回String类型值，它是可空的。
建立一个 Java 类
class JavaUser {
    public String userInfo(){
        return &quot;Java-帅次&quot;;
    }
    //返回null
    public String family(){
        return null;
    }
}


Kotlin 调用 Java 方法
fun main() {
    var user &#x3D; JavaUser()
    println(user.userInfo())//
    //使用时报错：NullPointerException
//    println(user.family().length)

    //平台类型，可能为null
    var fam &#x3D; user.family()
    //当fam为null时，fam?.length返回null
    println(fam?.length)//null
}


1.2 类型映射
代码运行时，所有的映射类型都会重新映射回对应的Java类型。
Java定义属性类型
class JavaUser {
    public String name &#x3D; &quot;Java&quot;;
    ...
}


Kotlin 查看类型
fun main() {
    println(user.name.javaClass)//查看类型：class java.lang.String
}

1.3 属性访问
刚才使用public修饰属性，在Kotlin可以直接调用，那么我们…</span>

                    <span>前言
业务场景为，在摄像机的播放画面上，按下手指左右上下滑动，摄像机跟随滑动。
由于播放页面使用了photo_view提供了画面图片的放大缩小和拖拽功能，导致和嵌套的要实现监听滑动的GestureDetector存在冲突的问题。
最终实现的解决方案为，在photo_vew默认状态下，让GestureDetector接收手指滑动事件，摄像机跟随旋转；在photo_vew放大状态下，GestureDetector不接收事件，让photo_vew处理放大图片的拖拽。比较好的解决了用户的使用场景问题
问题描述
onPanDown实现
首先，正常思路肯定是直接在Photoview的外部包裹GestureDetector，然后重写onPanDown，onPanUpdate方法，如下
body: GestureDetector(
        onPanDown: (e) {
          print(&#x27;fuxiao:按下 $e&#x27;);
        },
        onPanStart: (e) {
          print(&#x27;fuxiao:开始 $e&#x27;);
        },
        onPanCancel: () {
          print(&#x27;fuxiao:取消&#x27;);
        },
        onPanEnd: (e) {
          print(&#x27;fuxiao:结束&#x27;);

🍰 Android 13 前瞻

现在聊起 Android 13 更新确实是太早了，毕竟开始大范围推送 Android 12 更新的手机厂商两只手都能数过来，现在就开始聊关于 Android 13 的更新动态可能确实有点 …… 早。
但随着新一年已经到来，下一个 Android 测试版本预计也会在二月至三月期间发布：今年的 Android 12 早在二月初爆出重要渲染图：证实了两个关键更新 —— Material You 主题取色系统以及大改版的桌面小组件系统的存在。甚至还从某种程度上印证了 Pixel 6 的 ID 设计。
关联阅读：具透 | Android 12 来了：首个开发者预览版都有这些看点
即使在首个 Android 12 正式版发布之后这份曝光的可信度都存疑，但如今回顾，这份曝光中的几乎所有新功能都已经在 Android 12 最终正式版中出现。

说回 Android 13：从去年年底开始，我们就看到了来自多个信源的 Android 13 功能曝光：不仅有对于目前 Android 12 锁屏时钟样式的重新设计、还有关于蓝牙音频传输协议的功能加入，在 Android 12 大幅改进原生 UI 之后，Android 13 将重新聚焦于更多功能上的细枝末节。
从来自其中一份曝光来看，Android 13 正在开发一项代号为「Panlingual」的新功能…</span>

                    <span>2021年是我重启知识管理的一年。因为微信读书的推荐，我读了《卡片笔记写作法》，又因为《卡片笔记写作法》知道了 flomo, 再由 flomo 逐渐扩充自己的管理流程，具体的工具介绍可见《我的知识管理工具》。
在这篇文章里，我想谈一谈藏于工具背后的认知，也算是对自己21年知识管理实践的一次复盘。
全文无图警告。
一、内在驱动——为什么要做笔记
我们为什么要做笔记？
这个问题的答案，我认为就是我们选择工具、使用工具的根本指导。
追求美观、个性与追求效率导向的结果是不同的。对于前者，一本纸质的手账本配上各种文具可以玩出花来，对于后者而言，一个.txt 文件就可以满足需求。
对于我而言，做笔记是为了更好的输出。
其实一直以来自己的阅读量并不算低，微博、知乎、小红书……这些平台都有刷，微信读书上看的书也不算少，纸质书也读了挺多，输入是够多的。
可是我却一直遇到一个问题：到想写点什么的时候，总会遇到「诶，这个点子我之前想过，是什么来着？」「我之前看到过这个素材，是在微博还是在知乎上来着？」……脑子里是留下了痕迹，但早已被其他记忆轧得无法分辨了。
遗憾的次数多了，不免就变成后悔：如果那些想法、素材我当时能记下来呢？
大概在16、17年的时候，自己也接触过 PKM 这些知识，也买过印象笔记的教程，但因为那时并没有太强的输出欲望，所以也不是很注重搭建一个完整的闭环，属于那种「只剪藏」的人，其实我也不知道自己的印象笔记里到底放了什么。
可能是随着阅读的增加，年龄的增长，自己的输出欲望也越来越明显，所以那种想写却忘记的遗憾与日俱增，最终让我下决心，要重整知识管理体系。
现在回看自己这一年的重建历程，以写作为目的其实贯穿了我的整个搭建过程，在不自觉中完成了一次目标导向的学习。
对于如何搭建自己的知识管理体系，我的第一个建议是：找到内在驱动。
二、不要过分追求完美工具

一种幸运
有些时候我会这么想：人生中开到的第一台车是 Mini Cooper，这本身需要足够的幸运。
在开车回家的路上，想起来了向老爸借钥匙泡夏树的拓海，在这些年逐渐的成长过程中理解了重野秀一笔下的青春。终有一天，我们也会变成这既最好也最坏的时代中的，那个深夜里望着车发呆的人。
始终要轮到自己开车，轮到自己去看看广阔的世界，也要载着朋友、家人一起出发。
MINI 在 BMW 化之后的今天似乎又有了诸多的改变（从小写变成了大写），而在经过了一段时间的熟悉之后，（我与）这辆车终于准备好了。
这样一台 2011 年的经典三门 Mini Cooper Excitement（代号 R56），搭载 120 马力横置直列四缸 1.6L 自然吸气 N12B16BA 引擎与爱信 6 速手自一体变速箱，原配倍耐力 195/45 R16的星标防爆轮胎，至今已经行驶了十一万公里。

本文仅以 2021 年少数派线下聚会与老麦的约定为契机，谨献所有对 Mini Cooper 依然抱有兴趣的人们。
2021 年双 11 傍晚，与老麦再度相见，终有机会一起合影
关于 Mini Cooper 的 Q&amp;A
Q：你喜欢这辆车吗？
A：爱恨交加。要说爱有多深，恨就有多切。事实上，我并不喜欢开车这件事，甚至也因为停车困难和保养的麻烦一度抵触开车。但在马路上驰骋的和弯道上的快乐是不会忘记的，Mini 也当然是一辆能够令我笑出声的好车。
Q：Mini 适合女性吗？
A：Mini 适合所有人，但并不是每一代都是如此。女性标签是 Mini 的重要特色之一，但却不是最重要的。我在…</span>

我其实没有使用智能手表的需求，原来佩戴的西铁城五局电波表已经非常好用了：不需要充电、不需要手动校时，搭配定制表带当作装饰品也非常好看。
原装钢表带与定制牛皮表带
所以这是一次「深思熟虑」过的冲动消费，一方面是需要用消费让自己更快乐一些，另一方面也是希望补完三星全家桶，体验「Galaxy Ecosystem」到底能不能打。当然，Galaxy Watch4 一定要有让我眼前一亮的特性或功能，我才会像「陨石打到头」那般点击付款，其中就包括全新 Wear OS 以及发布会上看似非常厉害的「身体成分检测」功能。
现在这块手表在我手上使用也有两个月时间了，下面就来说说 Galaxy Watch4（以下简称 Watch4）给我带来了什么。
智能手表终究是一块表
相比传统手表，智能手表已然属于电子数码产品的范畴，但其本质还是一块表。手表就要守「表德」：颜值姣好、佩戴舒适、查看方便。Watch4 作为手表算是合格。
我手上这一块是 Watch4 44mm 幽谷绿版本，视觉上更偏向军绿色。三星产品虽然没有 Apple Watch 那般配件丰富，不过好在它采用了快拆表带，能够支持不少通用配件。直径 44mm 对我个人来说还是有点秀气了，Classic 46mm 版本倒是非常符合我的审美，但它除了配备物理旋转表圈以外，无论是性能还是续航都没有什么优势。唯一一点让我不满意的是，三星自家手机都属于窄边框领头羊，Watch4 又有何理由还在让边框停航母呢？
光照好的情况下会呈现军绿色
第一眼看上去，Watch4 非常薄，不过这只是在视觉讨巧罢了，三星利用表身最…</span>

                    <span>编注：本文包含对性内容的描述。本文探讨的议题非常沉重且现实，在留言讨论前，请慎重考量自己的言辞。

色情数字内容在中国违法，但在不少国家是合法的。
以日本色情影像界为例，在拍摄前，男女演员就知道色情内容将用于贩卖，法律、经纪人公司和工会会保障演员权益。行业规范要求演员定期进行体检，确保健康。演员充分了解拍摄作品会在贩卖店上架，也会上传到流媒体平台供付费用户观看。
可是，对大多数人来说，私密时刻是只属于两个人的愉悦，偷拍是不可容忍的恶行，更不用说传播到互联网。这也是为何，酒店中时不时曝出的针孔摄像机丑闻不断挑动人们的神经。偷拍行为，或者未经当事人同意并传播性内容，违反大部分国家的法律，与色情业是否合法并无关联。
在关于此类议题的一众声音中，我始终坚持这样一个观点：问题不在色情，而在知情，或者说同意。韦恩斯坦和爱泼斯坦激发的「#MeToo」运动，重中之重就在于未曾得到同意。当我们讨论酒店摄像头，那些愤怒与恐惧正是来自对隐私的侵犯与剥夺，它让当事人心中原本的温存与快乐变成了步步紧逼的噩梦，甚至会伴随终生。
她们对此有两层不知情。第一，不知道发生关系时拍下照片或视频。第二，即使知道被拍下照片或视频，也不知道会传播出去。
这些性内容传播的重灾区就在臭名昭著的草榴社区和 91porn。
达盖尔的讽刺

在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

介绍一下你自己
Hello 大家好，我是 B 站科技区的大狸子切切里，大家也可以叫我切里~
我平时会做一些数码产品还有游戏主机的视频，手机也做得比较多。不过我自己平时做视频的选题也比较随意啦，比如改造智能家居，分享一些游戏，甚至分享一些莫名其妙的小玩意儿。
我做视频一般会喜欢从贴近生活的体验小细节出发吧，分享一些有趣的功能，一些我自己的理解和看法。可能不是很专业，但是我会用比较有趣的方式分享给大家。
推荐一本书 / 游戏
推荐一本书的话，我当然是推荐《三体》啦！太佩服大刘的想象力了！
图 / 豆瓣
最近最喜欢的其实是游戏《死亡搁浅》以及游戏内收录的歌曲，但它不是一部电影啦。是一部非常有特色的电影化叙事的游戏。我觉得游戏和电影是两种截然不同的艺术形式，《死亡搁浅》是真的能让我感受到为什么说游戏是第九艺术。
图 / 豆瓣 @sosovipp
在订阅哪些服务 / 应用
在订阅的应用和服务有 Apple Music 和 iCloud。（Apple Music 的音质真的太棒了！iCloud 就更不用说了，作为一名视频制作者，手机里的素材简直不要太多🤣。）
分享一件今年让你印象最深刻的事 / 对你意义最重大的事
这一年对我来说意义最重大还是五月份的时候，托王也老师的福，在上海北京走动了一圈，和各位前辈大佬们见面取经！和 LKS、小鹿米老师、Tim 还有小鱼都合影成功😬
今年对我来说印象最深刻的就是 8 月份的时候，播放突破百万的两个视频。可以说那是我做视频的两年以来，最开心的一段时间了。一方面视频得到了大家的认可，一方面也是自己终于做出了点小成就，内心得到了满足，自信心也大大地提升了。在自己漫长的成长路上，有了方向有了动力，也更有想法去创造更好的未来。
突破百万播放的 2 个视频
过去一年你的城市中有什么经常去的地方 / 想再去一次的地方？
深圳内最经常去的地方好像是……机场？😅
想要再去一次的地方大概是东部华侨城吧~大学兼职的时候拿着工资去过一次，园区内真的好适合拍照嘻嘻。因为疫情的原因不能再出国旅游啦，于是第一次出国旅游去的日本，也成了我想要在夏天再去一次的地方。
推荐一个年度产品（好物）
PS5！索尼太牛了！最顶级的游戏体验还是得在 PS5。
 
用一个词概括你的 2021，应该是什么？为什么？
幸运。
其实我做视频的第一年一直都平平淡淡没有什么起色，今年一年内涨粉到 50w。我觉得并不是我今年比去年更努力，而是我坚持走下来了。很幸运跌跌撞撞后走上了一条相对正确的方向。
如果你觉得你走的路是对的，请相信自己，勇敢的走下去。
你心目中的年度照片

有什么今年新学会的技能 / 思维 / 方法论？
我之前视频里也有跟小伙伴们说过，克服完美注意拖延症。
拖延症大家多多少少都有点，其实我觉得人之常情。但是还有一种更可怕的，完美主义拖延症。我之前做事情就喜欢把事情计划到 100% 再来行动，我要把所有事情想的尽可能周全，比如做视频我要先列大纲再列时间表，再写好详细计划。这种做事方式就让很多事情最后因为要求太高而不了了之。
后来我发现行动力比计划重要。我需要先动手做，才能发现我会遇到的问题，再从已经做了的部分向前推进。道理看上去简简单单，但是真的贯穿我做频道的每一个阶段，有很多项目迟迟没有进展，最后发现其实还是只停在计划阶段，甚至还没有做第一步的落地。我就会提醒自己，诶？这不是老毛病了？
展望 2022
我能看到我和大佬们还有很大的差距，有时候看一些视频真是热血沸腾。我觉得我的视频里还少了一点这样的震撼吧～
2022 年也是我的本命年，希望能做出更加有深度更加有趣的内容，也希望自己能够多走出家门，拍些不一样的题材，也能多多运动！身体是革命的本钱，大家也一定要保重身体！
希望 2022 年结束，频道能做到 100 万粉丝吧！加油！！！冲鸭！！！

2021 年 12 月 9 日，备受时尚界关注的潘通（PANTONE）公司终于 公布 了 2022 年度代表色——长春花蓝（PANTONE 17-3938 Very Peri），一种红得发紫的蓝。

PANTONE 17-3938 长春花蓝含括蓝色的特质，同时又保有紫红的基调，展现一种机灵、愉悦的态度与充满活力的风貌，激发勇气十足的创意与想象丰富的表现。
——彩通色彩研究所副总裁 Laurie Pressman

对于很多人来讲，尤其是和色彩相关的同学来讲，每年看潘通的年度代表色发布已经成为了一种习惯。而实际上来讲，这也确实已经成为了一种习惯。从 1999 年开始，每年的 12 月份，潘通都会公布下一年的年度代表色，至今已经有 23 年了。也就是讲，从 2000 年开始至即将到来的 2022 年，每年都有一款年度代表色。
今天的这篇文章，我们聊一聊颜色与年度代表色以及它们背后的故事。
关于潘通的一些小知识
在开始正文之前，我们先了解一些关于潘通的小知识。「潘通」二字并不是 Pantone 的正式官方名称。它只是公众根据英文「PANTONE」而来的一个通俗的音译译名，而实际上「潘通」公司官方正式的名称为「彩通」。在实际的传播中，「潘通」的影响力早已超越了「彩通」，甚至于出现只知「潘通」不知「彩通」的情况。为了叙事方便，下文中如果没有特别指出，「潘通」等同于「彩通」。
潘通（Pantone LLC）是一家总部位于美国新泽西州卡尔士达特市（Carlstadt）的有限责任公司，目前它是 爱色丽 的全资子公司。潘通以其彩通配色系统（PANT…</span>

但也有部分车企比较叛逆，要么是另辟蹊径，要么是划水躺平，反正就是读不懂用户的心。
所以，接下三斤哥就为大家总结下我眼中2021年上市车型中最好和最差的几款，暨第二届“金轱辘奖”年度车型评选颁奖典礼。
写在最前（评选原则）

本次评选纯主观，如有不同意见纯属正常；
所有候选车型均为2021年新上市正式交付用户的车型；
上述新上市不含年度改款或变化幅度较小的中期改款；
候选车型尽可能从较为常见的品牌中选取；
……

第二届“金轱辘奖”最佳车型
纯电组——极氪001

获奖理由：如果你想买一台BBA，那你真的可以来看一看极氪001
其实极氪001自从上市以来就收获了很多关注，并且随着时间的推移，还得到了各种各样的吐槽，一度有不少人觉得极氪001是个非常大的坑。
但是让我们回归理性，极氪001这台车是不是真的像网友说得那么神 or 那么坑？
那么在我看来，如果只进行简单的选配的话，WE版的性价比其实还是非常非常高的。
即使是现在订车，WE版乞丐版扣除补贴后的售价应该是在28万左右，那么28万你可以得到什么？

一个我个人认为还不错的外观、无框车门、电动尾门；
媲美C级车的内部空间、可调节的后排座椅；
Model 3P级别的加速 or 蔚来标价12.8万的100度电池；
越级的内饰用料；
比传统豪华品牌更智能的车机和辅助驾驶系统；
……

以上这一切的落地价都没有超过30万，而30万落地的BBA又有什么呢？
插电混动组——比亚迪 秦DM-i

获奖理由：秦plus DM-i的上市让一切关于混动车是否更划算的争吵失去了意义
如果有人穿越到2021年初告诉你，今年有一款均价10万+的自主品牌A级轿车可以连续几个月进入轿车销量榜前十，你会相信吗？

凭借 ZZT 的成功，Epic MegaGames 正式成立。在命名新公司时，Tim 认为玩家的第一印象很重要，公司名字听起来像是“大”公司，这样才产生信任，而且要够酷够“狠” (badass)，最后把 Epic (史诗) 和 Mega (大) 组合起来，就有了 Epic MegaGames 的名字。
尽管 ZZT 销售情况很不错，但 Epic MegaGames 还只是 Tim 一个人的公司。Tim 需要开始下一款产品的开发和销售，产生收入。他看到 id Software 的指挥官基恩 (Commander Keen) 后大受启发。指挥官基恩是 John Carmack 受任天堂超级马里奥启发后开发，在 1990 年推出的一款 2D 横版卷轴过关游戏。指挥官基恩流畅的动作和画面给 Tim 带来了深刻印象，认为他下一款游戏需要突破 ZZT 这样的简单风格。Tim 找来了两位美术和一位作曲，开发了一款游戏机制和指挥官基恩相似的游戏 Jill of the Jungle，由玩家操纵女性角色 Jill 在森林中冒险闯关。Jill of the Jungle 的销量对比 ZZT 也上了一个新台阶，在发售初期每天能卖出 20 到 30 份。

除了自己继续进行游戏开发以外，Tim 也在考虑扩张团队。Mark Rein 会逢其适地出现了。Mark Rein 是一位狂热玩家，在 1990 年体验过指挥官基恩之后，他联系上了 id Software 创始人之一 John Romero 表达了自己对这个系列的喜爱。John Romero 也因此邀请他测试还在开发中的指挥官基恩 4。经过近距离交流，John Romero 认为 Mark Rein 具备 id 所代表的“黑客精神” (hacker mentality)…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
笔者实在没有半夜赶稿子的能耐，毕竟是一条社畜。一早起来就看到 @呆呆兽星君 的文章，细读之后，叹为观止。既然珠玉在前，笔者也就谈一下本次更新中另一位出手的女性——陆玲珑，以及她所依凭的全真功法，是如何给她自信上岛一闯的？

玲珑师承：大道至简  独全其真
陆玲珑所修习的是被金庸誉为”玄门正宗“的全真派功夫。

全真派源流
全真一脉是道家现存最大的两大流派之一（另一个就是正一派），由金代王重阳(公元1112年—1170年)创立，主张儒、佛、道三教合一，即以“三教圆融、识心见性、独全其真”为宗旨，相比正一派的祖师张道陵（公元34年－156年）晚了千年的时光。但是其开创的全真道流派却能够在千年之后与正一道分庭抗礼，其主旨所推推崇“以无为为主”，即注重个人修炼，相比入世甚深的正一派，则是回归老庄清静无为的思想。

白云观——全真三大祖庭之一
虽然相比正一派的入世风格，全真派恪守戒律，对于世事不会多做介入，但全真派始终坚持“贵生”的理念。陆玲珑师承全真龙门派，其拜师的北京白云观正是全真教三大祖庭之一。当年丘处机赴雪山应成吉思汗聘，成吉思汗问他如何治理天下，他回答应以“敬天爱民”为本；问长生久视之道，回答以清心寡欲为要。后回京居太极宫，元太祖因其道号长春子，诏改太极宫为长春宫。及丘处机羽化，弟子尹志平等在长春宫东侧营建下院，即今白云观，并于观中构筑处顺堂，安厝丘处遗蜕。

成吉思皇帝敕真人丘师：省所奏应诏而来者，备悉。惟师：道踰三子，德重多端。命臣奉厥元纁，驰传访诸沧海。时与愿适，天不人远。两朝屡诏而不行，单使一邀而肯起。谓朕天启，所以身归。不辞暴露于风霜，自愿跋涉于沙碛。书章来上，喜慰何言？军国之事，非朕所期；道德之心，诚云可尚。朕以彼酋不逊，我伐用张。军旅临试，边陲底定。来从去背，实力率之故然；久逸暂劳，冀心服而后已。是用载扬威德，略驻车徒。重念云轩既发于蓬莱，鹤驭可游于…</span>

                    <span>Today was my first day on the new project team. Although today&#x27;s focus was on the setup, I already learned a lot of (useful) things and tools that I didn&#x27;t know before. (I guess that&#x27;s the great part of always working in other project teams).
Let me describe today in more detail 🤓
Daily Scrum Meeting
I had been assigned a mentor 🥰 with whom I set up my laptop. By the way, this is an additional laptop, there is an extra laptop for each project for security reasons. I was given all the access to the tools they use, Microsoft Teams, GitLab, etc.
Jira
Jira, an agile management tool, with Scrum board (there are also other boards like Kanban). There all current issues are entered in the Scrum Backlog, active ones were assigned to a Dev, in the Product Backlog you can find the whole list of all issues. Jira is a very clear and good tool to work effectively as a Scrum team.
As you can see, Scrum is very present, so I recommend you to get familiar with the framework before your first job. It will definitely come across well in the interview if you have already dealt with it. 
Jenkins
CMD Shortcuts
GitLens
NVM
nvm use 16.13.1.
Today was great. 🥳 I learned so many new things without writing a single line of code. I&#x27;m really looking forward to finally getting started with my issue. 

Thanks for your reading and time. I really appreciate it!</span>

                    <span>To be a great developer you don&#x27;t need just knowing how to code , and hard tech skills, but also you must have a good soft skills ,so I share with you a list of 7 soft skills that will help you in your work.
1 - Problem-solving: you need to have the ability to know  the reason that caused  the probleme , then searching on solution and  fix it .
2 -Communication: is most important skill for any developer, becuase you need  to speak  with your colleagues,  managers, customers ,  and also  in meeting , for that  you need to speak clearly with confidence ,therefor spend mush time listening to others persones  and don’t interrupt while somebody is talking,adding to this you need to be patient and focused.
3 - Time management: before start your work should to write your to- do-list and set the the priority goals and period time of any task ,moreover take a balance between a work and personal live.
4 - Creativity: to be a creative developer you need to try and discover 
5 - Patience: you need to be able to keep calm When your code isn’t working and you can’t figure it out, Or when a code review is taking a long time,  and also when you start to  learn something  new .
6 - Teamwork: as a developer, you will work with a wide variety of teams and people for that you need to have a good social skills and communication ,rather than a good speaker and listener.
7 - Help other: helping your colleagues and customers is the most thing that make you building a good reputation and relationship in your work .

                    <span>Mi intención con esto es explicar como animar el corazón sin tener que dibujarlo con CSS3, en este caso es solo importar un icono o una imagen, esto va más que todo orientado a las personas que están comenzando a probar keyframes ya posteriormente en otro post explicaré como crear el corazón con puro CSS.
Font Awesome y tomando este icono  con esto ya tendremos el HTML.

Ahora, como soy medio flojo agarre un color gradiente de una página web llamada CSS Gradient y seleccione el que más me gusto, ustedes pueden hacer lo mismo, luego al body le di estos estilos para poder centrar el elemento. 
height: 100vh;

Hasta este momento vamos de esta forma:

Siguiendo con el corazón, usaré la clase que ya trae cuando importamos el icono para así darle su estilo y luego poder animarlo.
.fa-heart {


Ya tenemos un corazón.
 
Pasemos a la etapa final que es animarlo para que parezca que está latiendo.
CSS utilizando la misma clase anterior.
.fa-heart {

Sigamos ahora con el keyframe y le diremos que cuando tenga un 25% tenga una propiedad transform y que escale 1.2 su tamaño original.
@keyframes heart {






Ya con esto parecerá que está latiendo como un corazón normal, como pueden ver es algo sencillo y para nada difícil emplear una animación bien simple.

Today we&#x27;re going to be building an accessible menu system in Nuxt using recursion! You&#x27;ll be able to use this pattern in a variety of ways: navigation drop-downs, nested sidebar navigations, and plenty of others.
We&#x27;ll be building it in the context of a sidebar navigation. Think &quot;multiple sub-level navigation menus&quot; akin to what you would expect to see in the sidebar of a documentation site.
Those can get nested and messy very quickly, but we&#x27;re going to build two components to handle the whole thing!

Random Forest is one of the extremely useful algorithm since it works for both classification and regression tasks.

                    <span>What is Matrix?


In order to get an understanding of what Matrix really is, it&#x27;s the best to check it out directly from the official documentation.
However, to put it in layman&#x27;s terms, Matrix lets you choose the (public)server that you want to use it on. It even allows you to host and use it on your server! So, you won&#x27;t be locked to a specific server. And you can also communicate with your friends who are on different Matrix servers or different Matrix clients altogether. In fact, you can even communicate with friends who are using other messenger apps via Bridges.
Other messenger apps, on the other hand, won&#x27;t let you choose the server/provider you want to use their services on. For example, if you use WhatsApp, you have no option to choose the server/channel. And you can&#x27;t communicate…</span>

                    <span>Although both the Solana Tool Suite and Anchor have already got good native support for the M1 architecture, there are currently no official binary builds for the new Macs.
In this guide, we will go through all the steps needed to compile and install the tools on your machine natively, without having to set up a cumbersome Rosetta environment.
First, you will need to install the Rust toolchain.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt


This should be all what we need.
Before compiling the Solana Tool Suite, you will need coreutils installed on your computer in case you don’t have it:
brew install coreutils

Now let’s clone the Solana repository. I’m using shallow cloning to speed up things since the entire commit history is not needed.
# grab only the repo state at the v1.9.2 tag
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.9.2 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git

Then, go into the directory and run the cargo-install-all.sh script.
cd solana
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .
echo &quot;export PATH&#x3D;$PWD/bin:\$PATH&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc


This will take a while, but after it is finished, you can verify if the installation is successful with:
solana --version

There used to be an issue with solana-test-validator on M1 Macs, but the problem has been solved. You can try to spin it up to make sure it works.

Anchor is the recommended framework for Solana programs.
Note that Anchor uses Yarn v1 to manage Javascript dependencies in your project, so make sure you already have it installed on your computer.
Since there’s no official binary available for the M1 architecture, we’ll also need to build from source:
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.19.0 anchor-cli --locked

Then, you can verify if the installation is successful with:
anchor --version


And that’s it. Have fun building with Solana on your M1 Mac natively!

                    <span>Configuration is always a chore, but an unfortunately necessary evil. And configuring a package for CommonJS (CJS) and ES Modules (ESM) can be a waking nightmare—not least because it has changed a dozen times in half as many years.
As one of the implementers for Node.js Loaders, touching much of Node’s internal ESM code, I get asked quite frequently “how do I make this work!?” (often with angry tears); but yet more frequently I come across packages that are just misconfigured.
My name is Jacob, and I’m here to help.
I have confirmed all the provided package.json configurations (not specifically marked “does not work”) work in Node.js 12.22.x (v12 latest, the oldest supported line) and 17.2.0 (current latest at the time)1, and for grins, with webpack 5.53.0 and 5.63.0 respectively. I’ve pre…</span>

After learning Python basics, you&#x27;ll find yourself being overwhelmed with a lot of information, and this can be very hard to go on. It becomes easier to get trapped in the Tutorial Hell 🔥.
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 
In other words, The Flask Framework is a Python platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications using Python Programming language. 
If your goal is to use Python for Web Development apps, Flask is what you need (sort of) for the J…</span>

                    <span>🐉 Hi to all! My name is Michał and apart from being a web developer adn MDB founder I am also a huge fan of history, maps and fantasy 
⚔️ Over the years, observing the world of technologies, I could not help but feel that it is a great material for creating a separate universe that could become the basis for an extremely interesting story 
🗺️ This project is purely for fun. Using real data, such as the number of NPM downloads, stars on github or website traffic, I tried to measure the &quot;power&quot; of a given technology and visualize it with quasi-historical maps.
🛡️ Anyway - if you&#x27;re curious about what front-end technologies visualized as states would look like, read on.
And if you have any idea how this story and this universe could become more interesting, or more in line with real statistics related to the front-end - let me know in the comment!

                    <span>Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It has been a de facto choice for creating a web-server application in Node.js. Read these series if you want to use Express in your application.
Let&#x27;s see how you can make Express more secure.
Old versions of Express have vulnerabilities like Path traversal (CVE-2017-14849). The best practice is to use the latest stable packages to mitigate such vulnerabilities. You can use the npm audit command to find out known vulnerabilities in your Nodejs application. Then you can fix them by running the npm audit fix command. Make sure to get 0 vulnerabilities in the report of the npm audit command.
Proper HTTP headers can prevent security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting, Click-jacking, Packet sniffing and, informa…</span>

                    <span>Nuxt 3 beta dropped few months ago and with it, several modules have been updated to work well with a new Nuxt 3 architecture. For the previous version of Nuxt (also the most stable right now), we had a repository template for building new Nuxt 2 modules with it. These modules could be then released as NPM packages and easy downloaded for the users to provide useful functionality like PWA, i18n, Google Analytics and many more that you can check here. As there is no Nuxt 3 module template repository nor an article how to create one, I thought it would be a good idea to create one. 
In this article, we will be taking a look at @nuxtjs/strapi module as it is Nuxt 3 compatible, very well developed and documented.

                    <span>String slicing lets you slice into Python strings, and work with their slices, or substrings—instead of the whole string.
As strings in Python are immutable, you cannot change them in place. In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn to slice Python strings and work with substrings.
[start:stop:step]

The above line of code:
Returns a slice of the string —starting at index start, extending up to stop-1 in steps of step.
The start index is optional: the slice starts from the beginning of the string by default.
The stop index is also optional: the slice extends up to the end of the string by default.
The step value is optional too. The default value of step is 1 and includes all characters in the string.

In this article, I’ll explore some Sourcegraph search gems with you. 
Here are 8 Sourcegraph search features you should know about!
By default, all search queries on Sourcegraph are treated as literal patterns. If you know the exact string you’re looking for in the codebase, then all you need to do is paste it in the query box and search.
Sourcegraph interprets this search pattern literally (as the name defines it) to simplify searching for words or punctuation in your codebase.
With literal search, you can find function calls, error messages, comments, notes etc. For instance, if …</span>

In this post, we are going to see how to use loops with async/await. 
Before we dive into it, here are the utility functions I used for the demo

// creates a logger function to print logs with function name
function getLogger(fnName) {
  return function logger(value, diffInMS) {
    return console.log(

                    <span>人工智能重新“创造”了历史

人工智能越来越多的做到了之前 无法做到的事情。谷歌使用机器学习创建了克里姆特 1900 年的画作《哲学》，而之前它只有一幅黑白照片传世。也有人利用 AI 重建了伦勃朗著名的《守夜人》边缘的缺失板块，并在夏天将它们暂时安装在原画旁边。还有人利用 3D 打印和 AI 重建了隐藏在毕加索《盲人餐》下面的早期画作。以及，德国波恩的一个管弦乐队完整地“演奏”了贝多芬的第十首未完成的交响曲，这个版本是由一个算法编写的。


老王点评：AI 修“旧”如“新”，这真的是原来的历史么？




新的补丁集将清理 Linux 内核的“依赖地狱”

这项名为“快速内核头文件”的工作花费了一年时间整理，包含了多达 2297 个补丁，完全重塑了 Linux 内核的头文件层次结构。其目标是加快内核的构建，同时清理构建过程，以解决“依赖地狱”问题。Linux 内核中大约有 1 万个主要的头文件，在过去的 30 多年里，它们已经成长为一套复杂而痛苦的交叉依赖关系。这套庞大的补丁涉及到大部分的 Linux 内核代码库。根据测试数据，启用了“快速内核头文件”的内核要比原始的内核构建性能有可能提高 50-80%。这个庞大的补丁系列已经在 x86/x86_64、SPARC、MIPS 和 ARM64 等多种架构上进行了测试。这可能是 有史以来代码规模最大 的一个 Linux 内核功能调整。


老王点评：这是一项功在千秋的工作，确实需要清理一下瓶瓶罐罐了。




Canonical 招聘 Linux 桌面游戏产品经理

据 Steam Play 最新数据，Linux 上的游戏用户占比为 1.11%，虽然略有下降。而 Ubuntu 背后的厂商 Canonical 也将目光放在了 Linux 桌面游戏上了，现在正在 招聘 Ubuntu 的桌面游戏产品经理的新职位，希望“使 Ubuntu 成为最适合游戏的 Linux 桌面”，将围绕 Ubuntu 的桌面图形驱动选择，致力于与 GPU 供应商和其他 IHV/ISV 的合作。


老王点评：Linux 还是不甘心在桌面上退让啊，让我们看看 Linux 能不能复制在服务器等领域的成功。</span>

                    <span>2022 年已至，是时候期待一些激动人心的发行版更新了！这里我们挑选了一些值得关注的发行版选择。




是时候和 2021 年说再见了。

如果你错过了 2021 年的 Linux 大事件，现在你也可以去回顾一下。

不过，考虑到 2021 年已有许多令人印象深刻的发行版推出，2022 年，对于较新的 Linux 发行版以及现有版本的更新，人们的期待值已经直达顶峰。

与十年前相比，Linux 发行版如今更加注重用户体验。这不仅仅关乎资源占用，更关系到发行版的外观及对现代桌面硬件的兼容性。

先来简单回顾一下 —— elementary OS 6.1、Zorin OS 16、Pop!_OS 21.10 和 Linux Mint 20.3 都是于 2021 年推出的大型 Linux 发行版的更新版。这些发行版都专注于改善用户体验、改进视觉、优化生产力。

毫无疑问，你可以选择上述发行版并感受前所未有的桌面体验，也可以获取 最佳 Linux 发行版 的最新更新。

所以，到了 2022 年，你又应该期待什么？是否会有一个能让用户体验更上一层楼的发行版呢？

答案是肯定的，这里就有一些你值得关注的发行版。在此我列出了清单，重点强调 2022 年这些发行版的计划更新内容。

2022 年最值得期待的发行版

请注意：这里列出的大部分发行版的官方信息暂时缺失，不过本文章将定期更新以补充最新消息。

1、Slackware 15



Slackware 是至今为止 最长寿的活跃发行版。Slackware 15 Beta 版已在去年发布，稳定版将于 2022 年初发布。

对于新手级桌面用户来说，这并不那么吸引人，不过如果你想要一款支持旧硬件，或者能够有效利用资源的发行版，Slackware 可以成为你的候选方案。

再次强调一下，Slackware…</span>

前言
现在的 Android 项目中几乎少不了对 LiveData 的使用。MVP 时代我们需要定义各种 IXXXView 实现与 Presenter 的通信，而现在已经很少见到类似的接口定义了，大家早已习惯了用响应式的思想设计表现层与逻辑层之间的通信，这少不了 LiveData 的功劳, 因为它够简单好用。但如果将它用在 Domain 甚至 Data 层中就不合适了，但是现实中确实有不少人会这么用。
1. 为什么有人在 Repository 中使用 LiveData ?
当我在同事代码中发现并指出 Repository 中不应使用 LiveData 时，对方会理直气壮的拿官方文档反击我。这可能就是为什么不少人喜欢这样用的原因，因为这曾经是官方文档的推荐做法：
 
 https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide
 
 https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/blob/master/GithubBrowserSample
上面这些都是曾经在官网文档和Sample中出现过的代码，而且连 Jetpack Room 也对 LiveData 进行了支持，可以为 DAO 生成 LiveData 接口的 API。可见，正是由于官方的推荐，这样的用法才深入人心。
如今的态度
时过境迁，如今官方已经不再这样推荐，而且在最新的文档中对 LiveData 的使用范围做了明确限制，其中特别强调了应该避免在 Repo 中的使用

是个人就有说话的需求。除了说「有用」的话之外，人们也需要说废话。微博是个用来向朋友乃至整个互联网喋喋不休倾倒废话的平台，但人们有时会发现，有些废话实在太废了，废到自己都不好意思让别人看到，这就催生了微博——以及朋友圈、豆瓣广播等——种种「某某可见」的废话权限管理体系。
然而这依旧不够。对包括我在内的大部分人来说，朋友圈和微博始终是个「对外开放」的窗口——无论隐私状态是「仅自己可见」还是「所有人可见」，只要进入这些平台，你就感觉自己光着屁股来到了沙滩上，哪怕披着隐形衣，熙熙攘攘的围观群众依旧在对你施加压力。这样一种「有人看着呢」的心理暗示，使得你无论如何也没法放飞自我，畅所欲言。
那么，哪里有专供人说废话的「私人微博」，只包含一个朋友的「朋友圈」，乃至没有任何人际互动的「广播」呢？
我开始感到这种需求，是因为用了一段时间的 flomo。虽然最终也没输出啥成果，但那种随时随地、想说就说的体验，委实让我欲罢不能。这种欲罢不能并非来自什么「知识的复利」——而是单纯的畅所欲言、释放自己话痨本性的快感。
然而 flomo 是付费产品（虽然免费也可用），而且数据在自家的服务器（而非本地或自己的云盘）上，至少对我来说，总归有点不安稳。我于是开始寻找更好的选择。
「私人微博」的标准
在试用和评价之前，我们先要搞清楚一点：我们想要的到底是什么？「私人微博」应用具备怎样的功能属性？在厘清我们的需求以及满足这种需求的功能之后，我们才能开始一种有的放矢的评估。
我想，既然名叫「微博」，轻量化必然是这些产品的首要属性，最好是能做到打开就写，关闭即存。我就因此…</span>

iPad mini 6：一台怎么拿都舒服的 iPad，也许是今年最「香」的新品

全面屏是今年 iPad mini 的一项重要升级，这不仅意味着 iPad 产品设计风格的进一步统一，也让这款产品在继续维持小尺寸设计的基础上，拿得更舒服、变得更好「看」了。
得益于全面屏设计，新款 iPad mini 在屏幕变大之后，设备尺寸反而变得更小：第六代 iPad mini 的高度和宽度分别为 195.4 毫米和 134.8 毫米，第五代 iPad mini 则为 203.2 毫米和 134.8 毫米；为了让它能够「装」上第二代 Apple Pencil，厚度又略有增加。对了，300 克不到 (297 克) 的重量，相比前代产品也降低了 10 克左右。
因此，iPad mini 依然会是一台怎么拿都舒服的 iPad。拿着 iPad Pro，你可能会担心它「砸」在脸上；拿着 iPhone，你可能会觉得屏幕太小。这个时候，这台 iPad mini 就显得恰到好处。

                    <span>2021 已经过去，趁着元旦假期，回顾一下 2021，随意一些，想到哪里写哪里吧. 主要是对 2021 年的一个回顾，以及 2022 年的展望，2021 年当了爸爸，换了工作（中间还居家无聊了好久），收获了更多的朋友，也算是过的还可以
不过在个人成长方面，甚至感觉有点退步，这让我觉得有点慌，学如逆水行舟，不进则退，2022 年是需要好好深耕的一年，希望能和看到这篇文章的同学一起进步，共勉
另外也盘点了一下知识分享相关的数据、分享了一下这方面的收入、推荐的硬件、推荐的软件等，感兴趣的可以自取</span>

                    <span>While a lot of programming languages that have a &quot;nullish&quot; type (null, nil, etc.) debate about avoiding it, JavaScript is the only popular one that has two, you read that right, two nullish types. One of the most common recommendations is to stick to using only one, and my recommendation is to only use undefined and avoid null. In this article, we will go over the reasons you might also want to avoid null in JavaScript and TypeScript.
As Douglas Crockford put it in one of his talks, JavaScript itself uses undefined all the time, so let&#x27;s use the one the language uses:
let something; // This is undefined!

const otherThing &#x3D; {
    foo: &quot;hi&quot;,
};
otherThing.bar; // This is also undefined

const aFunction &#x3D; anArgument &#x3D;&gt; {

En este artículo exploraremos a fondo las características de los JSON Web Tokens, su composición y su implementación utilizando Minimal APIs y ASP.NET Identity.
El código de ejemplo lo podrás encontrar en este repositorio en mi github. Espero les sea de utilidad.
Un JSON Web Token (JWT) es un estándar (RFC 7519) que define una forma segura y compacta de transmitir información entre dos entidades en forma de un objeto JSON.
Esta información puede ser verificada y es confiable ya que está firmada digitalmente. Los JWTs pueden ser firmados utilizando una llave privada (con un algoritmo HMAC) o con llaves públicas y privadas utilizando RSA o ECDSA.
Aquí veremos un par de escenarios donde es útil y recomendable utilizar los JWTs:

                    <span>If you develop with IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, GoLand, or other JetBrains IDEs,  it’s likely you’ve waited for “indexing” to complete after opening a project. While this may be annoying, it’s necessary for IntelliJ and other heavy-weight IDEs to have features such as code search, highlighting, refactoring, and code completion.
Waiting for an IDE to finish indexing a project might not be a big problem for many workflows. After the first load, indexes are cached and subsequent runs are faster. However, indexing time can be a huge blocker for developers, especially in these cases:
large projects (monorepos, many dependencies, monolithic applications)


running old/slow machines (indexing is CPU-intensive)


ephemeral developer workspaces (containers, remote IDEs)

                    <span>OVERVIEW


Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open-source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. It’s usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. Some well-known open-source projects include Django, Postgres, MongoDB, Vue, Go, Ruby, TypeScript, Git and so many more.
There is a variety of good reasons to release something under an open-source license, from “more perspectives make better software” to “establishing a standard.” It is important to build a sustainable project to consider your reasons for publish…</span>

                    <span>I’ve been working on eaf-linter for about a few days now, and it already has 6 stars and 2 forks. My other project that I&#x27;ve been working on, the Backend Server, has 14 stars, 9 forks, and nearly 10 outside contributors. That might not sound like a lot, but both of these projects are only about a week old.
So, how did I do it?
The most important thing has been issues, which I talked about here. But, the second most important thing has been designing a great readme. 
A good readme is the difference between someone staring your project and someone ignoring it. If you have badges, easily understandable features, and lots of images, you have a star worthy repository. 
First, you need to have badges. If you don&#x27;t know what a badge is, it&#x27;s the little image that says how many stars, downloads, etc. a project has. These are also known as shields, and you can get them from this website. If you have a ton of them and they all say good things, it increases the confidence that someone has in your project. 
Secondly, you need easily understandable features. If you look at my newest repository, eaf-linter, you will see that all of the features have a simple headline and they link to a new page. This is very important. If your feature can link to a more in depth description of the feature, it will increase the confidence that the possible contributor has in your project. 
Finally, images are super important. In my backend server, I have a ton of really eye-catching images. These images increase the likelihood that someone will keep looking through your readme, and the longer that the person stays on your page, the more likely they are to star your repository. 
There will be more tips like this coming tomorrow and the day after, so if you liked hearing this, make sure to follow me, so you can see more tips as they come out.

                    <span>Have you ever wondered how can you utilize your Java skills in the serverless world?
JBang.
JBang
Properly configured AWS CLI with Access and Secret key
Terraform - latest/newest release would work.
I would not like to go through how these tools should be installed, I assume these things are a piece of cake.
❯ jbang version
0.86.0
❯ aws --version
aws-cli/1.22.5 Python/3.9.5 Linux/5.15.8-76051508-generic botocore/1.23.5
❯ terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.0
on linux_amd64

JBang is a powerful tool which lets you create .java files with your requested dependencies, and with different commands you will be able to build and export .jar files and native binaries.
Okay okay, we have Maven and Gradle, why would I need this?

                    <span>AWS s3 SDK and NodeJS read/write streams makes it easy to download files from an AWS bucket. However, what if you wanted to stream the files instead? 
There is a timeout on connections to an AWS s3 instance set to 120000ms (2 minutes). Unless you have very small files, this just won&#x27;t cut it for streaming. 
One option is to simply raise that timeout, but then how much should you raise it? Since the timeout is for the total time a connection can last; you would have to either make the timeout some ridiculous amount, or guess how long it will take to stream the file and update the timeout accordingly. This is also not taking into account the stream closing due to HTTP(S)&#x27;s own timeout reasons as well.
Instead of making guesses and fighting random bugs, we can make use of the NodeJS Stream AP…</span>

                    <span>Previously, I talked about how to create easily an Entity (ex:JOB) using a simple command line make:Entity and answering a few question(fields,type…).
This article will be about saving data to, fetching data from, the database.
To do so, we need to use a service provided by Doctrine, called EntityManagerInterface. The command  symfony console  debug:autowiring doctrine shows all doctrine services available.
Type-hint an argument $em to EntityManagerInterface, create an Object (ex $job), set all its properties then call persist and flush methods.

Calling persist() method tells Doctrine that we want to save the object, no query is executed yet. We call this method as many time as objects that we have, once we call flush() method, Doctrine execute the queries needed to insert to database.
We can check if data has been inserted with : symfony console doctrine:query:sql &#x27;select * from job&#x27;

Getting data(objects) from db is even easier, one way to do that is by using JobRepository $jobRepo as an argument in our method. 

The repository class offers many helper methods to get our data from db like : findBy, findOneBy... We can also add custom methods to have complex queries, more about that in my next article. 
Finally, I like to mention that Profiler provides a lot of tools to use when developing an app, for doctrine, it shows all queries executed :

Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my article on my passion project for the last year (and several years prior in different forms/codebases).
I&#x27;ve recently completed 52 weekly streams in 2021 as I worked on coding my app, from Hello World to what it is today.




Today (Jan 2nd) was the day of my first stream one year ago so I felt it was a good day to do this release. I will be having a LIVE 🔴 Release Party Stream later TONIGHT, (Jan 2nd, 2022) at 9 PM PT to celebrate finally getting the code live and also to answer any questions or comments anyone may have.




I&#x27;m also going to be answering questions throughout the 1st week of 2022 as I will post on several sub reddits that may find this project interesting. Today I have posted on /r/reactjs so fe…</span>

                    <span>É possível utilizar desestruturação para variáveis ao invés de sempre criar novas.
Por exemplo, caso tenhamos um objeto como o a seguir:
const user &#x3D; { name: &quot;Eduardo&quot;, age: 39 };

Podemos fazer a desestruturação com a seguinte sintaxe:
const { name, age } &#x3D; user;

console.log(name); // Eduardo

console.log(age); // 39

Porém se as variáveis name e age já tiverem sido declaradas no mesmo escopo, será necessário desestruturar e renomear ao mesmo tempo:
const { name: newName, age: newAge } &#x3D; user;

console.log(newName); // Eduardo

console.log(newAge); // 39

Para atribuir a desestruturação para as variáveis declaradas anteriormente, utiliza-se a seguinte sintaxe (parênteses na declaração):
let name &#x3D; &quot;Fulano&quot;,
  age &#x3D; 22;

({ name, age } &#x3D; user);

console.log(name); // Eduardo

console.log(age); // 39</span>

My partner and I have been talking about doing an ambitious project for 2022. We&#x27;ve decided to build 12 products in 12 months.
There are a lot of reasons I&#x27;m excited about this project. The first one was mentioned above.
I&#x27;m a builder. Creating things excites me. It makes me feel alive. I love everything from naming products, designing logos, writing bits of code, and setting up deployments. Every bit of the process is a fun way to flex my creativity. It brings me joy.

This is a great experience to me and to be honest, I also learnt a lot while giving mentorship. So today, I&#x27;d like to share some of my ideas about mentoring junior software engineers.
I would admit that, at start, I was quite happy that I could mentor 3 interns at the same time. It was my first official experience practicing mentorship at work, so I was very happy that my capability was recognised by my superior. However, I found that I was too naive. More mentees means greater responsibilities and I would need to spare more time from my work to provide mentorship.

Recently I felt like I wanted to branch out and learn something new. I&#x27;ve always been interested in the practical and creative side of programming, so being able to deploy a project that is public facing was an exciting departure from the myriad of bespoke and educational Python scripts I&#x27;ve written.
Django was exciting to me for a few reasons: 
Popular and Scalable (Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox)
Excellent Documentation
Embraces Test Based Development 
I started my journey by cozying up with the official Django tutorial which teaches you how to write a simple poll app. This was a good intro, and opened my eyes to the simplicity and beauty of writing unit tests in Django. However, I wanted something a bit friendlier – something in-between a drawn out 4 hour monetised Youtube video,…</span>

                    <span>Hello programmers, 
Do you want start your blog where you educate others, or may be you want a blog as a repository of all the information you’ve gathered over the years. Anyway, blogs can be a great source of information providers for others as well as yourself. It can really help you connect deep with the content you want to consume. Setting up a blog is easy, especially if you’re a programmer. You can create your own blog with Next.JS and MDX. In this article, I will show you exactly how to do that!
By the end of this article, we will have a blog site for ourselves, which is going to look like this. You can off course make it look more beautiful, but for the sake of tutorial, I made it look very simple.

                    <span>Have you gotten accustomed to the basics of git, but the advanced concepts make you scratch your head?

This article got you covered, not only will it introduce you to the advanced git concepts, but also show you how to use them in a real-world scenario! Let&#x27;s dive in.
Let&#x27;s first check the definition:
Git stash is a built-in command with the distributed version control tool in Git that locally stores all the most recent changes in a workspace and resets the state of the workspace to the prior commit state.
The stash can be thought of as a temporary storage for the changes you made, but did not commit. 
The real-world use case for this feature would be when you are not done working on the changes, but need to pull the updates from the remote repository.
To use stash, you need to add the fi…</span>

                    <span>This is my first finished python project. I started learning Python from Codecademy&#x27;s Computer Science career path and for my portfolio final project, I was tasked to create a basic terminal game. 
I decided to recreate an old Mongolian game that I used to play with my cousins while we spent our days in the countryside. The rules are pretty simple once you get used to it due to the similarities to UNO, a more familiar game to most. 
I would love feedback and comments about the game. Even if you don&#x27;t really have feedback, but want to let me know if you enjoyed the game or not, I would love to know if people played it.

Hashicorp Vault is an opensource software from Hashicorp. Vault is used to manage secrets. 
Secrets can be considered as anything that one uses to authenticate, authorize themselves. Secrets are also pieces of information that are private to any user. 
Examples of secrets:
Username, password
API Tokens
Database credentials
TLS certificates
Credit card information
Applications use a lot of credentials to connect to various external services like databases, message brokers &amp; cloud services. These credentials tend to stay in the config files, source code, version control systems like Github, log files, and plain text files. This form of exposing the secrets and making them vulnerable to unintended access is known as &#x27;state of secret sprawl&#x27;. Vault tries to solve this problem.

1. Centralization of secrets:
2. Access control via ACLS:
3. Audits:
4. Encryption of secrets:
5. Dynamic secrets:
6. Encryption as a service
7. High availability:
In the upcoming episodes, we will look into

                    <span>How to design a URL shortening service like TinyURL?
Software engineers usually struggle with system design interviews partly due to their lack of experience developing large-scale systems and partly due to the unstructured nature of system design interviews. Even advanced and experienced developers find system design interviews challenging since the design questions are open-ended and have no standard answer. To help with that, in my previous post, we discussed a step-by-step approach for solving system design interview questions. Let’s follow that approach to solve a classical system design question: Designing a URL shortening service like TinyURL.
Question Statement: Let’s design a URL shortening service like TinyURL. This service will provide short aliases redirecting to long URLs.

                    <span>微软 Exchange 服务器出现 “2022 年错误”

许多使用 Exchange 邮件系统公司在元旦期间接到了一条 错误报告： “FIP-FS 扫描引擎加载失败，无法将 2201010001 转换为长整型。”这是因为微软在 2022 年伊始发布了新的更新：2201010001 其中 220101 代表 2022 年元旦。而微软在内部使用了一个 32 位的有符号长整型来存储这个版本号，但是有符号的长整型最大值为 2,147,483,647，因此这个版本号溢出了，出现了没有预料到的 “2022 年错误”。为了解决该问题，微软发布了 新的更新 2112330001 —— 嗯这意思 2021 年 12 月 33 日吧。


老王点评：之前我们刚刚说过 glibc 还没默认解决 2038 年错误，没想到微软就赶快站出来表示 2022 年也有问题。




Nvidia 称其智能网卡速度已经超过了存储的世界纪录

Nvidia 的智能网卡配置的 Bluefield 包括了一颗不错的 CPU ，因此它可以运行防火墙或加密引擎等工作负载，这样主板的 CPU 就可以被释放出来用于更重要的任务。在 Nvidia 的一些测试中，数据的移动速度比使用英特尔的 Optane 存储级内存的本地存储更快。Nvidia 称，该结果轻松地超过了“以前使用专有存储产品创造的 1000 万 IOPS 的世界纪录”，达到了 4150 万 IOPS，可以使 400Gb/s 的网络达到饱和。当然，他们也承认，这项测试并没有模拟真实世界的工作负载。


老王点评：智能网卡技术是近年来的网络技术发展的重要发现，这个技术突破很厉害。




Haiku 可以通过 Wine 运行 Windows 应用程序

作为 BeOS 的继任者，Haiku 已经开发了 20 年，在将 Wine 移植到 Haiku 上运行方面正在取得 巨大进展，能够通过 Wine 运行 Windows 应用程序。

                    <span>这些应用程序可能不是绝对的必需品，但我很高兴在 2021 年发现了它们。




在这个 2021 年，我目睹了数百个有趣的 Linux 应用程序的开发取得了进展，并因此获得了更多用户。虽然其中一些已经止步，但其它的应用还在继续发展，不断地获得更多的关注和新功能。

虽然我希望我可以对所有这些应用都有所了解，但显然这是不可能的。不过，我已经挑选了 5 个我最喜欢的应用，并在这里与你分享它们。它们可能不会被列入 必需的 Linux 应用程序名单，但我却十分青睐它们。

在开始之前，应该注意的是，所有这些应用程序，除了 EverSticky 之外，都是融合性的，这意味着它们同样适用于桌面和移动 Linux 设备。随着 PinePhone 和 Librem 5 等设备变得越来越流行，我认为融合性应用是相当重要的，看到这么多的此类应用正在开发中，真是太好了。

言归正传，让我们来看看第一个应用程序。

早在 2016 年，当 KDE 发布 Kirigami 时，很明显，它是 KDE 的应用程序的未来。不幸的是，将成千上万的应用程序转换到一个新的 UI 工具包是相当困难的，这导致了 KDE 应用程序之间严重的不一致。

五年后的今天，作为桌面级应用的 UI 工具包，我们终于看到 Kirigami 被真正重视起来，这在文件管理器 Index 中得到了完美的体现。这个漂亮的应用程序能成为 Plasma Mobile 和 Nitrix Linux 的默认文件管理器，自然有原因的。

虽然不像 KDE 的默认文件管理器 Dolphin 那样功能丰富，但它有集成终端、文件预览、标签和分割视图模式等功能。这使得它可以和 Gnome 的 Nautilus 相提并论，同时它还有融合性和基于 Kirigami 的明显优势。

                    <span>探索 Kubernetes 中不同容器日志记录模式的工作原理。




服务器和应用程序日志记录是开发人员、运维人员和安全团队了解应用程序在其生产环境中运行状态的重要工具。

日志记录使运维人员能够确定应用程序和所需组件是否运行平稳，并检测是否发生了异常情况，以便他们能够对这种情况做出反应。

对于开发人员，日志记录提供了在开发期间和之后对代码进行故障排除的可见性。在生产环境中，开发人员通常依赖于没有调试工具的日志记录工具。在加上系统的日志记录，开发人员可以与运维人员携手合作，有效地解决问题。

日志记录工具最重要的受益者是安全团队，尤其是在云原生的环境中。能够从应用程序和系统日志中收集信息使得安全团队能够分析来自身份验证、应用程序访问恶意软件活动的数据，并在需要时进行响应。

Kubernetes 是领先的容器平台，越来越多的应用程序通过 Kubernetes 部署到生产环境。我相信了解 Kubernetes 的日志架构是一项非常重要的工作，每个开发、运维和安全团队都需要认真对待。

在本文中，我将讨论 Kubernetes 中不同容器日志记录模式的工作原理。

系统日志记录和应用日志记录

在深入研究 Kubernetes 日志记录架构之前，我想探索不同的日志记录方法以及这两种功能如何成为 Kubernetes 日志记录的关键特性。

有两种类型的系统组件：在容器中运行的组件和不在容器中运行的组件。例如：


Kubernetes 调度者和 kube-proxy 运行在容器中。

kubelet 和容器运行时不在容器中运行。


与容器日志类似，系统容器日志存储在 /var/log 目录中，你应该定期轮换它们。

在这里，我研究的是容器日志记录。首先，我看一下集群级别的日志记录以及为什么它对集群运维人员很重要。集群日志提供有关集群如何执…</span>

@甜約翰：机智医生生活 第二季

作品信息：2021-06 / 韩国 / 剧集 / 剧情 / 90 分钟 × 12 集 / 豆瓣链接
获奖理由：时隔一年，《机智医生生活》第二季如约而至。本季延续了第一季的剧情，继续讲述律帝医院里，医生、护士、患者们之间平凡琐碎却又温暖人心的故事。吵吵闹闹的「99s」全员回归 —— 搞笑担当李翼俊、理想主义安正元、冷面毒舌金俊完、十级社恐杨硕亨，以及机医五人组的精神支柱、「灵魂歌者」蔡颂华，剧集保持了「机智的请回答宇宙」一以贯之的高品质，是念念不忘又恋恋不舍的个人年度最佳。
不同于传统的医疗职业剧，《机智医生生活》第二季延续了「请回答」系列和「机智」系列的风格 —— 聚焦人、描绘人、挖掘人。本剧以非常规的叙述视角，精准的细节刻画，出人意料的各式反转，性格鲜明的人物群像，以及演员亲自演唱的 OST，把友情、爱情、人情写进了被称为「人生缩影」的医院里，并且较好地平衡了现实主义的无奈与理想主义的浪漫。
剧中没有勾心斗角的职场恩怨，而是一种可以每天吃吃喝喝、每周坚持练团，令人羡慕的成年人的「神仙友情…</span>

在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

自我介绍环节
大家好，我是赵赛坡，我把自己定位为一名内容生产者。
过去十年的时间里，我做过记者、参与过公众号的内容创业。2017 年之后，我开始专注使用邮件通讯（Newsletter）的形式，系统输出我的发现与思考。
我所创建的「Dailyio」是一份由读者付费支持的邮件通讯（Newsletter）产品，每周通过两到三封风格不同、主题迥异的邮件通讯（Newsletter），探讨新时代里的人机关系：

「iPad Power User」聚焦如何使用机器。以 iPad 为平台，关注使用数字工具（机器）及其背后的方法与逻辑；
「AI Insider」以人工智能发展为切入口，记录新技术和技术新趋势带给各行各业的机遇与挑战；
「Deep Reading」以反碎片化阅读的形式，推荐一系列聚焦机器如何定义社会的长文与图书。

撰写了那么多期 Newsletter 以后，你对这种内容形式有什么看法吗？
首先，邮件通讯（Newsletter） 并不是新鲜产品，即便是基于互联网的 邮件通讯（Newsletter） 的历史也非常古老。
其次，最近两年邮件通讯（Newsletter） 的火热，其实是建立在这样一个背景之下：强大的社交媒体（比如 FB）与算法分发（比如 FB 和今日头条）平台，改变了内容链条上的创作者与消费者的关系。
某种意义上说，创作者成…</span>

                    <span>tl;dr? -- Cut to The Chase
Having spent 40 years in the software industry -- as a documentor, developer, and test automator -- I can&#x27;t see that any of the work I did, however relevant at the time, survives:  Nothing beside remains.
Well, it&#x27;s now almost five years since I got retired.  For the first three of those, I worked on projects of my own, blogged, posted here, and contributed some to Ruby&#x27;s spec project.  As for the posts to my blog and posts here, it&#x27;s amazing how quickly the search engines learn to ignore your posts and cast them into the darkness-- think red shift.
Then in September 2019 I came to my senses, and started doing something that will last: contributing enhanced RDoc for the Ruby project itself.
So far, in the Ruby documentation I&#x27;ve:
Added &quot;What&#x27;s Here&quot; sections for about 20 classes and modules.
Re-written the introductory material for about 15 classes and modules.
Re-written entirely the methods documentation for about 15 classes.
Added separate documents for bsearch, dig, and implicit conversion.
From time to time I&#x27;ll post here, linking to some of these changes.
Happy new year!</span>

There are many types of software developer jobs from web developer to data science which is also included in the software field.

Day 1 of our 90 days and adventure to learn a good foundational understanding of DevOps and tools that help with a DevOps mindset. 
This learning journey started for me a few years back but my focus then was around virtualisation platforms and cloud based technologies, I was looking mostly into Infrastructure as Code and Application configuration management with Terraform and Chef. 
Fast forward to March 2021, I was given an amazing oppurtunity to concentrate my efforts around the Cloud Native strategy at Kasten by Veeam.

It gives you functionality for things like image manipulation, drawing lines and shapes, displaying images, working with trigonometry, and more. And it is especially popular for generative art, such as fractals.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to use p5.js to convert an image like this:

to a mosaic of dots like this:

This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of JavaScript and familiarity with pre-algebra, but prior knowledge of p5.js isn&#x27;t strictly necessary. You can follow along on this by creating an account on the p5.js online editor and logging in. The finished product can be found here.

                    <span>JavaScript single-threaded model


everyone knows that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. In other words, JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.
The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. JavaScript creates the execution contexts and pushes and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution process.
If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function’s execution because the page hangs.
A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions of the webpage, such as mouse click.
A blocking function can be a function that downloads a file from a remote server or …</span>

                    <span>Pluggy makes it so easy to allow users to modify the behavior of a framework without thier specific feature needing to be implemented in the framework itself.
I&#x27;ve really been loving the workflow of frameworks built with pluggy.  The first one that many python devs have experience with is pytest.  I&#x27;ve never created a pytest plugin, and honestly at the time I looked into how they were made was a long time ago and it went over my head.  I use a data pipelining framework called kedro, and have build many plugins for it.
super easy to do
As long as the framework document the hooks that are available and what it passes to them it&#x27;s so easy to make a plugin.  Its just importing the
hook_impl, making a class with a function that represents one of the hooks,
from framework import hook_impl

My goal this year was to beat Bower by the number of downloads. We were able to achieve this goal in November:

pnpm was downloaded about 3 times more in 2021 than in 2020:

These stats don&#x27;t even measure all the different ways that pnpm may be installed!

We collect some unpersonalized stats from our docs using Google Analytics.

Most of our users are from the United States and China.

Our main GitHub repository received +5,000 stars this year.

Our biggest new user this year is Bytedance (the company behind TikTok).

Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Simple! 😉
There are several ways to implement it, but the easiest for me is using Draper gem.
&gt; rails new decorator-rails

&gt; bundle add draper

Well, from this moment when we create a controller it will automatically create our decorator file in app/decorator folder.
&gt; rails g scaffold User first_name last_name

Among other files, the file app/decorators/user_decorator.rb has been created automatically.
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb

class UserDecorator &lt; Draper::Decorator

                    <span>The computing world had periods of obsession with &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; a few times. One such period was during the late 1970s and 1980s when &quot;logic programming&quot; was the big AI idea.
It was so huge and it failed so dismally that by now not only it is largely forgotten, but people rarely even know it ever happened.
Let&#x27;s take a dive into the history of AI, and check Prolog - the language at the center of those AI attempts, and while it&#x27;s not any in-depth analysis, we&#x27;ll bump into a few reasons why it all failed.
Prolog does logic programming, but it also has some basic ability to do regular programming like I/O and so on. Many Prologs also have builtin constraint solver libraries similar to Z3. I&#x27;ll stay away from those parts and mostly focus on the core Prolog.

As you guys know, Python is a popular language that is assisting developers in creating PC, games, mobile, and other types of applications. This is possible due to its libraries that are almost more than 137,000 in number. Crazy right? Moreover, in this world that revolves around data where buyers demand relevant information while buying, big companies or even small start-ups require &quot;data scientists&quot; to get valuable insights by processing massive data sets.

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a linter right now, and one of the requested features for it was code duplication detection. I made an issue for it already, but I need to start working on it. And, that&#x27;s where my question lies. 
I can either build the system to detect the duplications based on plain text. This is how most systems work because it is the simpler of the two options. But, it is also the most failure prone. For instance, this system would fail if there was the same exact code in two places, but there was a comment in the middle of one of them- it would not register as a duplicate.  
Alternatively, I can use an abstract syntax tree to detect the duplications. But, theres another problem there- what is the most-lightweight and all-around-best javascript parser out there? I&#x27;m planning on using the babel parser but I&#x27;m already running into a problem because it doesn&#x27;t parse the comments in a way I would like. 
So, if you have an opinion on what I should do, please leave a comment below. Also, please star the project and contribute if you have time. If you can, that would be amazing, and I thank you so much!</span>

What is OO and why we use ?
Lets begin with the “Pillars”
Bundling data with the functionality that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some components.
Did we had encapsulation before the OO Languages ? Yes, in C we had perfect encapsulation. The header file contained the signatures of functions and data structures, on the other hand the a .c file would implement them.
The users of our functions and data structures would include  the header file never knowing anything about our implementation. Code exemple:

深度学习不可信

过去 20 年，深度学习透过一系列商业应用逐渐主导了人工智能研究和应用。专家认为，该技术是 不可信的，因为它无法解释，而且不适用于某些应用，因为它会经历灾难性的遗忘。换言之，如果算法有效，无法理解它为什么有效。而当该工具慢慢学习新数据库时，其学习记忆的任意部分可能会突然崩塌。因此在任何攸关生死的应用（例如医疗应用）上使用深度学习都可能存在风险。


老王点评：虽然 AI 也确实在很多领域发挥了重要作用，或具有神奇的效果，但或许我们现在对 AI 的认识还只是盲人摸象。

事情是这样的。如果你愿意，你可以叫它文件夹，如果你喜欢，也可以叫它目录。这没有什么区别。

但是，如果你想知道为什么文件夹在 Linux 中被称为目录，这里有一些解释。

为什么在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录？

在我解释之前，让我们回顾一下文件夹和目录在现实世界中的用途。

在现实中，文件夹（封套）可以用来保存几个文件（或其他项目）。而目录则可以用来维护项目的索引，这样你就可以找到哪个项目位于哪里。



现在，让我们回到目录。这个词甚至在 Linux 存在之前就已经存在了。它来自 UNIX 时代。Linux 继承了 UNIX 的很多东西，这只是其中的一个。

现在让我告诉你一些可能让你吃惊的事情。目录并不是真的把文件放在里面。目录是一个“特殊的文件”，它知道文件在存储中的位置（通过 inode）。

这就说明了为什么它被称为目录。目录用来保存项目的索引，而不用保存项目本身。Linux 和 UNIX 中的目录并不保存它里面的文件。它们只是记录文件位置的信息。

如果你想了解更多关于它的信息，我这篇关于 硬链接 的文章应该可以帮助你。

那么，为什么它被称为文件夹呢？依我看，这是视角的原因。当你在一个图形环境中时，你会将事物可视化。在这里，文件可以像页面一样被可视化，这些文件页面被存储在一个封套（文件夹）中。

当操作系统开始使用图形元素时，我认为一些术语也相应地发生了变化，目录 -&gt; 文件夹就是其中之一。

你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？

这完全取决于你。你可以按你的习惯使用这两个术语。

然而，如果你正在学习 Linux 命令行或经常使用它，使用目录这个术语可能会有一点帮助。

有一些 Linux 命令，如 mkdir、rmdir 等，术语 “dir” 给出了一个提示，即这些命令与目录有关。

同样，许多 Linux 命令和 bash 脚本会使用选项 -d 表示目录，-f 表示文件。

甚至终端中的文件属性也会通过在目录前面加上字母 “d” 来区分文件和文件夹（目录）。

拿这个例子来说，我有一个名为 some 的文件和一个名为 something 的文件夹/目录。请注意各种 Linux 命令是如何用 “dir” 或 “d” 来区分文件和目录的。



所有这些让我觉得，在使用 Linux 命令时，使用 “目录” 这个术语会有好处。你的潜意识会更容易将 “dir” 和 “d” 与目录联系起来。

再说一次，你想叫它文件夹或目录这完全取决于你。人们会明白你指的是什么。

我刚刚对目录一词的历史渊源做了一些分析，这应该会给你一些提示，为什么人们说 “在 Linux/UNIX 中，所有东西都是一个文件”。

现在我结束了我的胡言乱语，我请你对它进行评论。如果你发现任何技术上的不准确之处，请告诉我。

                    <span>除了 System76 宣布了基于 RUST 的新桌面环境之外，还有别的团队也给桌面 Linux 用户带来了一些新东西。




过去的几年里，我们很欣慰地看到 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队正在扩大他们对 Linux 社区的影响。如今，伴随着全新 Maui Shell 的发布，他们的影响也已经得到了进一步扩大。

让我们一起来看看吧！

关于 Maui 项目的一些背景介绍



作为由 Nitrux Linux 团队原班人马创建、开发、维护的项目，Maui 项目已经开发了许多基础应用。实际上，他们的文件管理器 Index 甚至成功进入了我们的 2021 年五大应用列表 之中！

他们的所有应用均使用 MauiKit 这款定制框架开发。基于 Kirigami 的 MauiKit 专注于跨终端融合性，因此开发出来的应用可以在电脑和手机端拥有一致的体验。此外，它为开发者提供了更多的预置组件，因此创建应用可以更加便捷。

目前 Maui 项目开发的部分应用包括：


Index（文件管理器）

Nota（文本编辑器）

VVave（音乐播放器）

Clip（视频播放器）

Pix（图片查看器）


虽然这些自制应用本身质量不错，但它们在 Nitrux Linux 的默认桌面环境 KDE Plasma 里总显得不合群。因此，Maui Shell 应运而生。

Maui Shell 介绍



借助与 Maui 应用相同的 MauiKit 和 Qt 技术底层，Maui Shell 是 Nitrux 在桌面环境领域的一个新尝试。从上面的截图可以看出，它在很大程度上受到了 GNOME Shell 的启发，这在使用过程中也确实有所体现。

但，这并不意味着 Maui Shell 没有原创的地方。从底部上滑可打开类似于 GNOME “活动”的概览界面。与此相邻的是一个小 Dock，可以通过相当美观的启动器来启动应用。右上角有一个与 macOS 相似的控制中心，内有精心设计的菜单和许多控制功能。

在我使用它的过程中，一切都是如此精致、自然。我感觉这与它极致现代、扁平的设计美学有关，我甚至认为 Maui Shell 已经超越了 GNOME 和 KDE Plasma 等同类软件。说到 Plasma，与 Nitrux 的默认 Plasma 版本相比，Maui Shell 在低端设备（和虚拟机）上的反应更加灵敏。

总的来说，我预测 Maui Shell 将依靠其实用性成为 “Linux 桌面环境之王”。然而，我还没谈到 Maui Shell 最核心的特性：跨终端自适应性Convergence。

主流之中的融合

许多人可能还记得 2010 年 Canonical 开发了一款类似的跨终端桌面环境 Unity，它最终以失败落幕，到 2018 年则被完全淘汰了。但是，Unity 和 Maui Shell 有一个共同特性 —— 那就是跨终端融合性。

随着 Linux 在移动端的开发力度逐渐加大，跨终端支持变得尤为重要。由此来看，一个新的桌面环境竟能同时支持桌面端和移动端，的确不可思议。

这一点必须依靠大量的跨终端应用实现，而 Maui 已经处在了完美的衔接点上。这仅仅是我相信 Maui Shell 能成为 Linux 桌面未来的原因之一。

立即试用 Maui Shell

与其他新发布的软件不同，Maui Shell 已经预装于新发布的 Nitrux 1.8。如果你想亲自尝试一下，那请随时从下方链接中获取 ISO 镜像。但是，在尝试之前，请务必知晓：Maui Shell 仍处于早期开发阶段。

尽管 Maui Shell 拥有许多特色功能，但部分功能可能存在问题、尚未实现，要么就是缺失了，其中包括：


蓝牙支持

PulseAudio 支持

网络开关

媒体控制（MPRIs）

拖放支持

多显示器支持

设置应用

XWayland Shell 插件


因此，我暂时不能建议你使用 Maui Shell 作为主力桌面环境。为此，你可能需要等待 2022 年秋季发布的正式版本。

在此之前，我仍将持续关注 Maui Shell。对于这款桌面环境，你的评价如何？欢迎在评论区说出你的想法！

在使用 iPad mini 6 的这一个多月时间里，我发现我又重新拥有了平板电脑。
是的，我太久没有使用过「平板电脑」了，这几年我一直都在使用 iPad Pro 12.9 搭配妙控键盘，它几乎一年 365 天没有离开键盘的时刻，我早已习惯地把 iPad Pro 当成一台触屏电脑使用，而不是可以捧在手中的平板。
iPad mini 6 在我眼里就像是久而未见的老朋友，陌生却又熟悉，让我找回了平板最初的形态，很好地融入了生活。

一.让我们聊聊尺寸
这台小设备有许多可以聊的地方，我想先从「小」这个话题开始讲起，
尺寸是一切
iPad mini 6 的核心在于尺寸，8.3 吋是无压力手持的黄金尺寸。
很多人形容 iPad mini 6 是一个「便携」设备，我觉得这个形容词不够准确。如果我每天都背双肩包上班，那我觉得 12.9 吋的 iPad Pro 很便携；如果我每天只背小挎包出街，那 iPad mini 6 称得上便携。如果我想每天无负担出门，那只有手机还算便携。所以你看，每个人的通勤场景都不一样，对于便携的理解是不一致的。

我的定义是：这一个非常适合手持的阅读设备。无论是两只手捧着，还是单手举着，我都能找回以前看小开本书籍的感觉。
我可以在通勤时拿起它看书，可以在如厕时捧着它消遣，也可以在睡觉前回顾信息。大尺寸 iPad 并不适合在这些场景下使用。

只要我出门带包的情况下，我都会背着 iPad mini 6，因为我总能在包里找一个合适的位置放置它。一定程度上，携带一台 iPad mini 6 并不会给我带来太大负担，这也是 iP…</span>

                    <span>This year, I tried doing Advent of Code for the first time. My goal was to write code solutions in Haskell and JavaScript with more or less equivalent implementations. I have been learning functional programming academically for five or six years, so Advent of Code gave me an opportunity to practice what I have been learning. Unfortunately, things didn&#x27;t go exactly as planned, so here are some of the lessons I learned:
Don&#x27;t rush learning
Just start somewhere
Functional programming has different flavors
Functional programming in JavaScript is meh
Use the strengths of the language



The first two days of Advent of Code went according to plan. I came up with relatively concise solutions in Haskell that translated to idiomatic JavaScript, then wrote blog posts summarizing my approach. Day th…</span>

This is one simpler issue, but the simplest bug can be the biggest at times, so I made sure I document it and can help anyone out there too.
In my react project&#x27;s root I have a GitLab-ci.yml file that automatically runs whenever I push a commit to the server. It triggers a notification to the runner I specified, and then it processes the series of tasks I specified.
Which involves building and deploying.
This is a legacy React project, and had long been updated. After upgrading the packages I git committed. Build built successfully but deployment failed. With the following error:

I read through the error to understand what the problem really was, and I found it:
Module.createRequire is not a function

That was the only error that was reasonably clear indeed and meant something.
So I Googled it, and I found out that it&#x27;s an issue with Create React App, it&#x27;s always on or looking for the latest, which means the Node engine version has to always be the latest and that includes my npm version, else some things might break.
So in essence whatever machine running that project has to have Node &gt;&#x3D; 14.0.0 and npm &gt;&#x3D; 5.6
My GitLab-ci.yml contains a Docker image with a node version of 10.15.3, so there is a need to upgrade.




image: giona69/node-10.15.3-aws-eb

And I temporarily replaced the docker image with the latest node.




image: node:14.18.2

Rebuilt Node-Sass
I added 
npm rebuild node-sass 
And Voila!! That fixed the issue. These weeks has been simple, this is the issues I have been experiencing.
My name is Anayo Oleru, I specialise in Backend Development(NodeJS &amp; ExpressJS), but I am experienced with Web frontend(ReactJS) and mobile(React-native). And I am open to offers in these fields.

                    <span>Hello Everyone 👋,
We will leave 2021 in a few more hours. Is it just me? I feel like 2021 is much shorter than the previous years.
I participated in Polywork&#x27;s #My2021Highlights and created My 2021 Highlights collection. And that&#x27;s when I realize (again) how I grow so much within 1 year!
I had ups and downs, but all of those were worth it.
growing pains. 😄
I&#x27;m writing this post to remind me of what I achieved and overcame throughout this year. It will be something that I will look back to when I have hard times and keep me motivated.

I started to write in November 2020, but not until 2021 when my articles and me, as a writer, started to get recognized. How I achieved so much within one year:
My articles got into CodeNewbie&#x27;s newsletter several times throughout the year since January.

                    <span>This will be multi part post where I will take you through understanding what is NAS? How to setup NAS on your own using Raspberry Pi.
Part 1: Motivation
Part 2: Bake the Pi
Part 3: Install OpenMediaVault
(coming soon...)
Recently I felt a need to have NAS which I can access on my local network and eventually expose it over internet for things like backing up my photos, videos, backups etc. 
But I was hoping it to be more than just a regular NAS. I want it to run other services likes password manager, media player server which I can access on my mobile phone, tv and other devices.
Buying NAS is a good option but it is very costly. So I decided to build one myself. 
This multi-part post is share my experience and steps I followed to setup one for myself.

                    <span>Today we will learn how to create our own directives in Angular. In my previous posts I discussed all the built-in directives which Angular provided. If you are unaware, I would highly suggest you to start from the part_1 ( of the 6 series post).
So the first question that can strike you is why we need a custom directive when Angular already provided us with 6 amazing directives. The simple reason is there can be multiple scenarios where the exact requirements are not met using the built-in directives. In those cases we need to write our own logic to meet the requirement and custom directives comes to the rescue.
Now, lets see how we can create our own custom directive.

We use our phones for almost every day. We used to shop at malls, line up at banks, and plan our trips at agencies. But now, we can do all these things in our homes using smartphones. All of this is made possible by a high-level programming language called Java.
Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) used on the Internet. Java is a high-level language that is also easy to read and understand. Using it, developers can write once and run anywhere, which means that compiled Java code runs on all Java-compatible platforms without the need to recompile.

React is  a Java-script Library used to build UI(User Interfaces)
It is a Open-source project Developed by meta.
In React we built Component that can be Reused.
In React our Focus is to built Components and by combining smaller component we make bigger Components.
Declarative Approach → We Just have to tell the React What to do we don’t have to worry about how it do.
Component-based Design → In React we use Re-useable component so we have to write the less code.
Virtual DOM → So DOM is like a big tree which have the many elements and manipulating the DOM takes time , so what React does is It directly make changes in the Java-script then update in the DOM so that React can Stay Fast.

本周话题：产品化思维
上周四，华为发布了一款血压手表，戴在手腕上就能测血压。

它的实现很独特，可能是第一个这么设计的手表。

大家看上图，它的表带里面有一个垫层，那是一个微型气囊。
测血压时，手表向气囊充气，使它鼓起来挤压手腕（下图），从而感受到心跳和血压。

我看着这个设计，觉得似曾相识，这不就是腕式血压计吗？


华为的这块血压手表，简直就是腕式血压计的迷你版。但是，大家知道吗，两者的差价有多大？前者的官方定价是2988元，后者只要100多元人民币。
当然，我知道不能这样比较，血压手表是智能产品，有许多其他功能。但是，它的主要卖点不就是测血压吗？这一点上，它并不比腕式血压计强太多。你只需要5%的钱，就能得到一个方便程度差不多、测量结果可能更准确的设备。
我并不是说华为这个手表不好，只是感叹两者的差价这么大。为什么那些血压计厂商就没有想到，血压计可以做成一块手表呢？ 
既然已经可以戴在手腕上，为什么不索性做得再小一点呢？加入计时功能，配上彩色屏幕和操作系统，马上就变成了血压手表，价格可以提升一个数量级啊。
这么显而易见的一个产品思路，那么多血压计厂商怎么会无人想到呢？
这就是缺乏&quot;产品化思维&quot;的表现，不善于把功能提升为产品，然后推向市场。 如果腕式血压计的厂商具备产品化思维，看到自己的产品，就会想到手表市场，甚至可穿戴设备市场。反过来，华为的产…</span>

                    <span>高效工作，品质生活——这句藏在少数派网站标题结尾的朴素口号，却是少数派的读者和作者们相聚于此的初心。就像你最爱的那张专辑总有 AB 两面一样，效率与生活也是岁月这张磁带的一体两面，无论哪面都记录着动人的乐章。2021 年的飞轮即将呼啸而过，和往年一样，我们也想邀请你从效率和生活中挑选一面、倒带与我们分享过去这年录下的旋律——

技术正以前所未有的速度和力度，嵌入和支撑了每个人的日常。见证着飞速变迁的技术景观，你如何更新工作学习的工具和方法，看待层出不穷的名词和概念？置身于不断冲刷的信息洪流，你怎样过滤和整理外界输入，让自己保持专注、清醒和宁静？我们渴望在「效率」这面品读你的心得。
走过又一个变数与希望并存、沉思与喜悦交替的年头，人们都学会了格外珍惜当下、关照内心。今年你的轨迹留下了怎样的弧线，对生活有什么新的感悟和思考？有什么美食和物件点缀着你的日历，又有哪些风景和瞬间照亮了你的回忆？我们愿意在「生活」这面中静听你的倾诉。

当然，我们也是有备而来的。今年少数派准备了总价值超过 50000 元的丰厚奖品以及额外的活动参与奖励。
如果你已经跃跃欲试但觉得需要一些灵感和启发，也可以先看看我们过去几年的征文获奖作品：2020 年、2019 年、2018 年。这并不是要让大家追随特定的范文或格式——我们非常盼望看到别出心裁、不拘一格的讨论——但或许能让你在动笔前对一篇「好」分享所应有的质量了然于心。
本次征文活动从 2022 年 1 月 1 日起至 2022 年 2 月 28 日（截止时间 2 月 28 日 23:59）截止。

@宇宙浪费指南：《爱情神话》可以说毁誉参半，也可以说叫好不叫座，看电影前我也比较忐忑，鼎鼎大名的「爱在三部曲」我欣赏不来，同类型的片也难有让我惊叹的，不过，这部电影倒是有些超出预期。
这不是一部传统的电影类型片，很多地方它反常规，更多地方也不遵循套路，这里没有两女争一男的俗套戏码，也没有描述中年离异男女生活里的鸡飞狗跳，或许电影的故事发生地设定在上海，沪语的氛围加上上海的格调，才能把文艺中年的爱情拍得有格调但也接地气吧。
很多人用「灵啊」来形容这部电影，不光因为这是一句上海话，也是对导演灵气的夸赞。作为一个外地人，她把上海的精致、文艺和包容力展现得…</span>

                    <span>搬家到一个陌生的城市，往往意味着对周边一无所知。不仅如此，连社会关系都需要重新构建。在完全适应新生活、找到新的朋友圈之前，如果想要一个人探索新城市，有哪些地方可以去呢？
希望这篇文章可以为你提供一些「新城市中可去之处」的灵感，去哪里、怎么探索，以及如何在新城市迅速找到感兴趣的目的地。
探索的边界
在列出一些可能的目的地之前，可能需要思考一下，你能去到最远的地方是哪里？不同的城市规模也不同，根据偏好的出行方式，即使是同样的出行时间也能去到不同距离的地方。
如果喜欢步行，就可以先从周边的社区开始探索；如果不讨厌公共交通，那隔壁区甚至全市的景点都能去到；可以开车的话，能去的地方就更多了——时间充裕的情况下，连郊区和隔壁城市都能探索一下。
不同的交通工具带来了不同的边界，每个人愿意踏出的距离也不同。如果不常出门的话，不妨从自己舒适的边界内开始探索，习惯了出门再把活动半径慢慢向外延展，用最舒服的方式感受新城市的魅力。
可以去哪里？
可供探索的地方有许多不同的分类方式，在这里我把它们分成了「固定设施」和「限期活动」两类。
「固定设施」指的是那些相对而言固定的建筑，在很长一段时间内都不会有关门谢客的顾虑，什么时候去都可以（不包括疫情这样的意外情况）。除了建筑之外，当地的景观和特色美食也属此列。
「限期活动」则是说只在限定时间内开展的活动，过期不候，像是艺术展或快闪店。对这些活动来说，消息来源是重中之重，我相信谁都不会希望「喜欢的艺术家要来开展了但是我看到 repo 已经是展览结束三天后了」这样的情况发生。
这两类地方的特点和探索方式略有不同，因此会在下面分别介绍。
固定设施
想要从头探索一座城市，最简单的做法是跟随游客的脚步，看看这里的知名景点。
地标景点通常承载了这座城市的历史和文化，在某种程度上，是这座城市过去、现在和未来的缩影。另外，正因为这些景点是大部分游客都不会避开的存在，相关…</span>

                    <span>在我的知识星球「玉树芝兰」上，有一位名叫 Kevin 的朋友提了这样一个问题（简明起见，问题原文经过编辑）：

我是一名工具爱好者，但一直没怎么接触过电脑；对于稍微懂些计算机的人看来是很常识性的东西，我却感到力不从心、没有把握。由于不了解相关的计算机知识和底层逻辑，我虽然也能使用 Zotero、DEVONthink、Obsidian 等生产力工具，但总是浅尝辄止，难以到位；这让我在创作时感到一定的负担，无法达到「随心所欲」的状态。
其实我的要求也不高，就是希望弥补自己的计算机知识，达到足以理解当前所使用工具的程度。但不知道为此需要学习哪些背景知识，例如简明的 Python 语言课程或者计算机通识书籍。很希望老师能推荐一些经典、优质的资源。

我觉得这是个很有代表性的问题，所以在此把答案分享给你。以下是我的答复（有改动）。

Kevin 你好！
我们把问题梳理一下。如果你的需求刚好和工具提供的功能匹配，我想你是不会感觉到「力不从心」的，也不必去顾虑自己对计算机底层逻辑和计算机语言知识欠缺，正常使用就好。你有这个疑问，很可能是因为你的需求与工具功能不完全一致。所以，你想做的，是打造个性化的高效工作流，需要对工具进行改动、补充或者综合。如果我的理解不准确，欢迎你补充。
「懂」与「不懂」，差别在哪？
想想看为什么我们会喜欢效率工具，其实它帮助我们包裹了一些实现细节，给我们提供了好用的功能。如果你对计算机底层了如指掌，那大可不必去追逐工具的更新，或者天天尝试新工具，而应该自己来改造甚至全新设计合适于自己的工具。
就拿编辑器来说，VS Code 出现之前，计算机界「自古以来」有两大阵营，分别是 Vim 和 Emacs 。

Emacs 就是个典型的可扩展工具，号称是「伪装成了编辑器的操作系统」。如果你掌握了 Lisp 语言，那么可以自己开发上面的各种宏和插件，简直就是千变万化。你看，那…</span>

                    <span>自从疫情大流行以来，我们一直就在见证着改变历史的种种大事，从大到政治军事小到口罩文化，对整个世界都产生了不小的影响。而在疫情笼罩下的这一年，足坛也发生了太多事，足以改变和影响未来，年终了我们就来盘一盘，今年的足坛里发生了哪些称的上是“蝴蝶效应”，足够影响未来足坛的事件。
新冠疫情的影响继续，哪天是个头
新冠疫情是这两年全球都逃不开的大背景。不论是国内还是国外，太多人的生活在2020年疫情开始后就彻底改变了命运线，足坛也是如此。
就在我写下这些文字的时候，疫情的影响使得德国等国足球联赛又开始实行空场政策，西班牙等国也重新开始限制观众入场人数，而因为疫情导致多队赛程推迟的英超尽管没有通知停赛或者空场，但像皇马、切尔西、曼联这样人才储备丰富的球队因新冠也面临无人可用。

（图）国际新闻里疫情重新影响足坛
球队缺兵少将是新冠对球队带来的直接冲击，从长远来看，新冠疫情直接影响了足球这项运动赖以生存的场景，也就是与球迷观众形成的互动。
毕竟足球只有在有球迷观众时，流量热度和商业价值才能有的放矢。
据《镜报》报道，疫情影响欧洲足球俱乐部共遭遇87亿欧元损失，其中顶级联赛72亿欧元，其余级别15亿欧元。按收入类别，球票收入损失40亿欧元，赞助收入减少27亿欧元，转播收入减少14亿欧元。报告还表示，整个欧洲共有15家顶级联赛球队37家次级联赛球队申请破产，这一数字超过了2011年35家破产的纪录。


（图）欧足联主席切费林今年“吃”相也很难看
前不久拜仁名宿鲁梅尼格也表示，每进行一次空场比赛时，拜仁会遭受四百多万欧元的收入损失。想想对于拜仁这种家大业大的球队，疫情带来的损失就这么严重，那么对于一些中小俱乐部，几乎就是灭顶之灾。
更令人有所担忧的是，那些已经感染过新冠的球员到底有没有后遗症，有没有后续并发症的影响这个还是个隐藏的不安因素。

                    <span>Whaddup folks! It&#x27;s that time of year again where I do the very very very terrible decision of going to a shooting range and explosives field to destroy USBS and man this year was fun, I got to mess with A C I D and a few toxic folks from tiktok (No you won&#x27;t get my tiktok, ever) to give suggestions on how to destroy, mangle, melt and vaporize my USBS this year... those were some terrible choices, glad I brought earplugs haha.
So first off, I decided I&#x27;d use music to my advantage and I got a very special type of chemical in my posession that quite literally acts like an acid when you sing or play a Bb next to it.
For the rest of my USBS, I decided I&#x27;d go ahead and use a sniper rifle on half, and explode the rest using low grade C4 (learned my lesson from last year using high grade!) and man was that fun!
I can&#x27;t say too much about the rest but I will probably post an image or two to twitter later!
Jonyk5 OUT!

Hi everyone, today is the last day of year 2021 and I wanted to do a year end review and also share my plans for the next year with you all.
Amidst all the chaos of pandemic that 2020 brought upon us, I did not plan extensively for 2021 but instead I focused on a theme.
I wanted the year of 2021 to be my year of YES.
I decided to not hesitate when new opportunities come up and go for exploring new things in life.
There were three high-level things which I wrote to focus on 1st January 2021 in my journal, they were: 
Health
Career
Growth 
I had multiple health issues and I wanted to focus on improving it. 
What did I do about it? 
I did meditation, walking and kept my diet in check for most of the days. And also took consultation from a Doctor whos…</span>

                    <span>The certain situation the world has been in for the past almost two years has affected a lot of us devs all around the globe. This hasn&#x27;t stopped us from delivering amazing software and do good deeds though - Au contraire! Think of global remote hackathons, local efforts to create services that help people in need, providing schools with old laptops, the list goes on. 
Arguably, the tech industry has adapted rather quickly. Video calls became a widespread norm, employees of some companies, like Twitter, can now work from home forever if they want.
(As a little disclaimer: I&#x27;ll use the word &quot;remote&quot; in this post to describe non-onsite things in general, even if you&#x27;re in the same town as your peers.)
With the new remote situation came a few hurdles, though. And in this post I want to discus…</span>

                    <span>In this article, we are going to learn how to build a blog and or add a blog section to an already existing Next.js project. To create the content of the blog we are going to be using an extension of the Markdown syntax: MDX.
When using Markdown in a website, there is always a compile step in which all the syntax markdown is converted into the HTML that the browser can understand. The problem with using plain Markdown is that you are limited to the handful amount of HTML elements that markdown is aware of. With MDX, you can extend those elements with your custom React components. It looks something like this:
import {Chart} from &#x27;./snowfall.js&#x27;
export const year &#x3D; 2018

# Last year&#x27;s snowfall In {year}, the snowfall was above average.

                    <span>I’ve been working on a project recently and a bunch of people suggested that I should start using a testing system. This testing system was working for a while but then someone else suggested that I should start using a linter. The linter ended up breaking all of my testing code, and before long I had spend nearly three hours getting them working together. 
Here was the project if you want to check it out
After that, I was told that the code was inconsistently formatted, so I needed to add a prettier system. All of my engineers are now telling me that they have lost countless man-hours battling against this new integration system.
So, I’m getting rid of it. My entire linter system, code grading, beautifier, etc. is gone. And, I’m replacing it with my own solution- if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. 
I want to hear what struggles you have had with your “systems to boost efficiency”, or if you think I am completely wrong and should shut up.</span>

                    <span>As a beginner programmer, it’s difficult to decide which programming language to learn first. The software development industry is fast-paced, and the market is constantly changing. There are over 700 programming languages in use, and each of those languages has its own advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. 
So, how do you decide where to begin? 
Well, the good news is that learning any language will open up doors and create new opportunities for you. In this article, we’ll explore the different types of programming languages, along with how to choose the best first language for your personal and professional goals. Then, we’ll give an overview of some of the most popular languages in use today.
Let’s get started!

                    <span>I wanted to make a compilation of some of the nicest Python projects that have gained popularity on GitHub this week.
As his creator defined, SQLModel is a Python library for interacting with SQL databases. It is based on Python type hints, and it uses Pydantic and SQLAlchemy internally. We can argue that SQLModel is just a layer on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.
SQLModel was created by the same person who created FastAPI, so you can expect a pleasant and flawless integration between both.
Although SQLModel was launched no more than 4 months ago (at the time of writing this), it already offers many features, and some others are already being developed, I encourage you to give it a try.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re looking to learn a new programming language, I recommend checking out Elixir. Elixir is a process-oriented, functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). The language was influenced by Ruby. This inspiration can be seen and felt in Elixir&#x27;s ecosystem and tooling options. Elixir is known to be easy to learn and widely applicable within the software development industry. 
In this beginner&#x27;s tutorial, I&#x27;ll walk you through the Elixir language and discuss its use cases, tools, syntax, and much more.

                    <span>While some of us might be back to work already after a glorious holiday, some of us will be back after the New Year&#x27;s holiday and will face the inevitable. I am one of the latter and is definitely not quite ready yet.
I am curious on what did you do during the long holiday - either personal and professional wise. Below is my story. 
Spent my leave on staycation. I hang out with the family and in-laws. Lots of shopping and ice skating.


Ate a bunch of unhealthy food I shouldn&#x27;t be eating - more than what I imagined. Major diet after New Year to follow. 😊


Finally, wrote couple of ReactJS articles here at dev.to and created a video version that I am very proud of (still honing my video recording skills). Below are the links if you want to check it out. 



Thanks for the dev.to community for a great, warm support of the articles.

@宇宙浪费指南：《山月记》 

我深怕自己本非美玉，故而不敢加以刻苦琢磨，却又半信自己是块美玉，故又不肯庸庸碌碌，与瓦砾为伍。于是我渐渐地脱离凡尘，疏远世人，结果便是一任愤懑与羞恨日益助长内心那怯弱的自尊心。

也许，很多人初识《山月记》甚至初识中岛敦，都是因为这段话吧，我也是被这个狠狠戳中，才找来原书看。
简单来说，《山月记》可以被认为是一本同人文，小说取材于中国古典故事，如《左传》《论语》《庄子》《史记》《西游记》及唐传奇。中岛敦将古典人物抽离出来，重新灌注以思想，在这本书里，历史不是主线，更不是背景板，主角只有一个个古籍里的人物，有在自傲与自卑之间无所逃遁最终异化为老虎的李征，有不停追问生命意义的沙僧悟净，也有战败被俘后被迫投降的李陵......他笔下的人物超越了史书中刻板印象，变成一个个真实、有血有肉的形象。
有人说，这本书能帮助青年们对抗虚无主义，的确，我们从这些人物中感受到他们在时代和自我之间的对抗、感受孤独、悲悯和勇气。
在李征篇，书中通过他的大量心理对白把他的自恋和自伤展现得淋漓尽致，一个自卑又自负的诗人鲜活的站在我们眼前，而他想一边想入仕一边又鄙夷的想法也深深刺痛一直在懦弱的自尊心和自大的羞耻心之间来回拉扯的读者们；而李陵篇中，书里的三个主角司马迁、李陵和苏武虽是我们耳熟能详的历史人物，中岛敦对他们的故事也有自己的解读，在他的笔下，司马迁不再是那个即使遭遇了如此磨难也毫不动摇的完成《史记》的人，他崩…</span>

                    <span>在前不久举办的 2021 腾讯年度游戏大会（TGDC）上，有不少与游戏行业相关的专业人士都做为嘉宾登台发言，站在他们的领域和角度阐述了自己对游戏发展的看法，其中一个相对冷门的角度却引发了我们的兴趣——青少年网络防沉迷。
在不少家长心中，网络和游戏依然是洪水猛兽。面对家长、社会和孩子之间围绕「如何正确使用网络」而产生的矛盾，我们也不禁思索：拔网线、砸电脑，真的可以挽救已经沉迷网络的孩子吗？到底是什么原因让青少年沉迷网络呢？有没有一些客观的衡量标准来判断一个青少年——甚至一名成人——是否已经沉迷网络？在本期节目中，我们邀请到了中国青少年研究中心少年儿童研究所所长孙宏艳，和我们详细聊聊青少年网络防沉迷的相关话题。

                    <span>科技是一种人文素养，我认为 Swift Playgrounds App 的核心定位正是如此。
未来世界创新、创业、创造的大门，需要我们用一种有着人文温度的方式去开启。
我自己从初中开始看硅谷三大春晚——Apple WWDC 开发者大会、谷歌I/O 大会、微软Build 大会；在高中的时候，虽然身为文科生，但是开始了装「黑苹果」、自学编程的神秘炼金术之旅。Swift 因此成了我的计算机语言母语，而大学时期也很幸运地入选了 WWDC18 奖学金计划，能够带着我们团队自己开发的 App 见到了库克。我们后来休学创业，拿了几轮融资，至今还在这个波诡云谲却充满魔力的创业场拼搏。
这些过去的经历，都成了乔布斯所说的「connecting the dots」的一部分。我和一家做少儿素质与编程教育的机构也有着不少的合作，也带过几支天才少年队伍，看着他们忘我地投入，看着他们迸发着颠覆性创造力的光芒。
由 Apple 推出的编程工具 Swift Playgrounds 近期推出了 4.0 大版本，我使用它开发了一个简单的疫情数据看板 App，并以此作为一次简单的体验，将过程中的思考和体悟和大家分享。
我们为何学习编程、如何学习创造，Apple 给了我们他们的思考。虽然 Swift Playgrounds 现在还充满了各种瑕疵，但我们也看到了全新的可能：AR、AI、传感器、多维交互、物联网，这些前沿的技术，以及伴随其中的人文主义光辉，都能够在这个小小的设备中，经由每一个开发者的研磨，如同坩埚一般，炼就出自己的结晶。
让我们开始吧。
本文概要

Swift Playgrounds 更新了4.0大版本，可以在 iPad 中实现 App 的开发并发布到 App Store。
我尝试着在上面写了一个疫情数据实时看板 App，并将代码开源在了 GitHub。

开发体验充满了惊喜与迷思。虽然 SwiftU…</span>

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

少数派的朋友们大家好，我是名字很正直的朴步成，名字扒自郭德纲老师的著名相声，是于谦老师众多称呼中，本人最喜欢的一个。是老麦的颜粉，是少数派的读者，看到城市漫游指南系列之后，忍不住想要与大家分享我的小城市，Plymouth 普利茅斯。
机缘巧合我来到了这座海滨城市上大学，对于在海口生活了二十余年的人而言，确实是一件新鲜事。记录一些陪我们走过青春的，一座小城的往事；分享一些对今后，有缘前往南英格兰的朋友们，未必有用的帮助。
英国非著名港口城市 - 普利茅斯

普利茅斯位于南英格兰德文郡（Devon），临近盛产小精灵的康沃尔郡（Cornwall），和如果不查资料无论如何想不起来的：萨默塞特郡、多塞特郡。
苦于其尴尬的城市定位，普利茅斯只能一度自称英国最安全的城市之一，但这没有任何吸引力和含金量的榜单，甚至 2016 年以后也未能再见到普利茅斯的名字。更何况作为旅游目的地，不如可以便宜购物的卡迪夫、「天涯海角」 彭赞斯；求学而言，比起周围的埃克塞特、巴斯，南安普顿和布里斯托又差了不少。

普利茅斯的话，若是独行，便不必去了。
—— 鲁迅
铁轨与行人几乎是触手可及的距离
从伦敦希思罗出了航站楼，直达普利茅斯最舒服的方法是坐大巴，但你若是一个旅行者，绝不能错过驶向南英格兰的火车。切记坐在南边靠窗的位置，火车上最能感受南英格兰壮丽的海岸线。
关于普利茅斯，其实可以不说的一些事儿
「五月花号」离岗的海湾，也是每个旅行者必拍的景色

这是一个信息爆炸的时代，大多数人陷入信息洪流难以自拔。为了避免这种情况的发生，我们不得不使用一些手段捍卫自己的信息流。

我们需要阅读工作流

每天，我们睁开眼后的第一件事不是上厕所，而是打开手机。手机屏幕已经有十几条早间新闻推送在等候我们的阅读。在通勤路上，我们如果不是在刷短视频，便是在微博、知乎等平台查看一些实时热点。到工作单位以后，我们打开经常访问的网站，查看需要阅读的内容，并将其保存至书签或者稍后读软件。即便是在短暂的如厕时间，打开微博等资讯平台刷一刷早已成为标准操作。
直到睡前的最后一刻，我才发现尽管我每天一直在不停地阅读各种信息，然而绝大部分阅读内容却成为过眼烟云。各种信息如流沙般随风而逝，我甚至想不起我十分钟之前的阅读内容。在饕餮快感之外，我几乎没有多少阅读所得，可能唯一的收获便是阅读内容时所激起情绪涟漪。

那么，如何在信息过载时代高效地处理信息流呢？

从长期来看，自然是提高我们选择、查找、评估和利用信息的技巧和能力，也就是所谓的提高信息素养。然而，提高信息素养并非一朝一夕之事，需要经过一定的训练和长期的实战。从短期来看，比较实用的办法便是建立阅读工作流，以对抗信息流沙。一个可靠的、标准化的阅读流程，可以使我们在尽量减少意志力、情感等精力消耗的情况下，辅助我们高效完成日常的信息管理。
我的信息管理方案
我的信息管理工具
从信息管理的流程来看，我们可以从信息获取、信息阅读和信息处理这三个阶段对信息管理进行分解。
工欲善其事，必先利其器。经过一段时间的摸索，我找到了以建立阅读工作流为目的的信息管理流程。

                    <span>So happy to share probably the most important and special moment of our entire lives.. I hope you guys enjoyed being able to watch. I look forward to looking back on this video a few years from now.
WARNING, this video WILL have you crying.

We also shared some personal information with you guys and why this baby is so much more meaningful to us.
This baby literally saved both of our lives and it was something we didn&#x27;t know we needed.

We&#x27;ll see you all again soon! With a school skit 🤪

Thank you for being apart of this new journey and chapter in our lives and we&#x27;ll definitely keep you updated!

                    <span>I recently made a video covering speedrunning Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s Security Breach, but in the short time since, ALREADY several new tricks have been discovered to slash down FNAF Security Breach completion time to even less than 3 minutes! Won&#x27;t be long till we get close to 2 minutes at this rate!

Team RAR just busted 100 SUPERHERO MYTHS in 24 Hours (https://youtu.be/iurmE2h2r7U) but today we have some unsettling news: someone has broken into the Team RAR Mansion and destroyed the World&#x27;s Tallest Trampoline Tower!!! Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world&#x27;s tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn&#x27;t see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town. Everyone has filmed with this trampoline tower from @David Dobrik, @Drew Dirksen, @Bryce Hall, @Jordan Matter, @Unspeakable, @Ben Azelart and …</span>

                    <span>Today we completely break Cuphead speedruns by using the Mugman Army glitch. This glitch allows us to spawn unlimited Mugman clones, and can results in some extremely fast fights. This speedrun is one of my favorites

My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!

This speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto” tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Celebrate with Miranda, Beatriz and the rest of the “Encanto” family streaming now on Disney+.

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 
HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Metadata etc.
BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.






    

    
     
    


: This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.
All the HTML elements that can be used inside the 
element are:

The  HTML element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one  element in a document.

I’m also working on a frontend, but I’m at a stage where I can change the stack for it completely, so I wanted to hear your suggestions! You can check out the code so far here, and the domain for the website is fairfieldprogramming.org. 
Do you think I should switch to react, pure html/css, or should I use vue? And how do you think I should communicate with the server?</span>

                    <span>Hello guys, 
instead of a new article, I&#x27;d like to share two printable cheatsheets with you. 
I hope you&#x27;ll find these useful.
The first cheatsheet shows a common development workflow when working on a development project. Among these are:
How to initialize a Git repository
How to add and remove files from the Git repos
How to manage code changes over several new features

Get the PDF from my Git repos: https://github.com/tq-bit/dev-cheatsheets/blob/main/q-bit_cheatsheets_git_and_github_IGit%20Cheatsheet_I.pdf
The second cheatsheet shows you a common, distributed development pattern and visualizes how several maintainers work on the same codebase. 
It attempts to answer the questions about: 
How does a pull request work?
How are local and remote repositories synchronized?
How to delete a remote branch?

                    <span>2021 has been a very challenging and exciting year at the same time but at the end I managed to do the switch I always wanted... 
10 years ago I started my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Information Technology but due to life circumstances I was never able to pursue that career as sometimes life gets in the middle you see. 
I remember, 6 years ago, I was talking with friends and they were asking me what I want to do, what is the dream job for me.. and I remember I was just smiling and I was saying &quot;Web development&quot; and everyone was telling me that I need to focus on that and follow my heart. But in life things aren&#x27;t as straight forward sometimes. 
I was at a point in my life where I didn&#x27;t have the space to think or dream about anything, but I had to do what I had to do in order to pay my bills. Bu…</span>

                    <span>Perhaps the greatest lesson I&#x27;ve learned from creating Agrippa so far is just how important tests are. Of course I knew they were important before - everybody does - but it&#x27;s so easy to just push it aside and focus on more exciting code, or write some perfunctory tests that don&#x27;t really, well, test anything. Eventually, however, slacking off on testing comes back to bite you; for me, luckily, it did when things were only getting started, but the point was clear - writing good tests is a top priority.
For Agrippa, however, writing good tests is far from trivial - it&#x27;s a CLI for generating React components based on a project&#x27;s environment (dependencies, existence of config files, etc.), as well as an optional .agripparc.json config. In other words, a lot of its work is reading &amp; parsing comm…</span>

                    <span>Object-Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming


Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language. Generally, we love object-oriented (OOP) programming! Object-oriented programming makes our code readable, reusable, modular, and is generally pretty simple paradigm to get our heads around.
In Ruby, everything is an object. We generally divide up our code into Classes and Instances, so this isn&#x27;t an unfamiliar concept. Really, everything!
Let&#x27;s try it out!
self
# &#x3D;&gt; main

self.class
# &#x3D;&gt; Object

nil.class
# &#x3D;&gt; NilClass

true.class
# &#x3D;&gt; TrueClass

Even nil? Yes, nil is the singleton instance of NilClass.
Okay, what is this main thing? Well, main is the default top level context provided to us in Ruby. Since everything is an object, we call this the global object. But even our global…</span>

At Facets.cloud we are planning to have a series of articles that aim to explain some of the complex cloud pricing logic and when you need to use them.
AWS RIs are a great way to obtain a discount on your always running workloads (base compute) by committing for certain duration like 1 year or 3 years. Typically, you would look at your base on-demand compute to determine how many RIs to purchase at any time. This is all great in the normal course i.e. your business is growing and you are increasing the cloud spend and possibly buying more RIs time-to-time.
For AWS too, it is a good deal as they get assured future business and lock-in. Another important point to note is that for cloud providers, the cost of an instance, storage or any other services reduces year on year. This…</span>

These eight productivity tips will supercharge your productivity as developer. You&#x27;ll save hours of time which you can then invest in other activities.
This is not a complete list of everything you should be doing, but these things alone will drastically improve your productivity if you are not already doing them.
Lets say you are writing code in an old Java monolith and your flow for every change you make looks something like this:
Save file (1 second)
 Build Project in IDE (5 seconds)
 Deploy application war file into old J2EE container (30 seconds)
For every change it takes 36 seconds before you can get feedback and try out your changes. This might not sound like a lot, but if you are doing this for every change this might happen 50 or more times per day. That&#x27;s 1800 seco…</span>

                    <span>INTRODUCTION
Have you ever run into the red screen of horror while debugging a flutter app?

I mean, if you haven’t, are you a Flutter developer at all?
Out of numerous reasons for your app to relay your error in such a manner, null errors are one of the most common. In an attempt to eliminate this and the numerous null errors that occur while building/debugging your app, the great Flutter and Dart team introduced Null Safety.
In simple terms, Null Safety allows the dart analyser to detect possible null errors pre-compilation, that is, before you even run your app. It ensures proper notifications of possible null data that could break your app while running.
This article is for you, if
You understand the basics of data types in Dart.

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago, I nearly scrolled past this gem on my twitter feed: sync-contribution-graph, by @kefimochi. Go have a look! 
You can use this tool to have your GitHub contribution graph accurately reflect contributions from other accounts you make use of. For example, outside of work I use the handle mtfoley, but I have a separate account I use for my job. I like the idea that I could use this to accurately reflect my activity level, and that no private information about that work handle is revealed.
The way it works is pretty straightforward.  When you configure it with a username and a time frame (year), it performs an HTTP request to the appropriate URL, and parses the HTML in the response for the dates/counts of contributions (these correspond to those little green squares).  Ba…</span>

                    <span>引言
11 月底，一则 「微信更新外链规则」 的新闻在国内引发了不小的涟漪。在《关于〈微信外部链接内容管理规范〉的更新说明》中，微信宣布，将在点对点聊天中允许直接访问外部链接，而在群聊中试行允许直接访问电商类链接。
尽管这条新闻细读之下有些讽刺——本意促进互联互通的链接，竟然要受制于一个平台的生杀予夺，而微信的调整也有点不情不愿、半遮半掩，但这总算是往健康、开放的方向迈了一步。
而同一时间，国外也有一群人在为「链接」的未来发出呼吁。不过，他们想得要更远一些。
12 月初，一份名为 《泛在链接宣言》（Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking）的文档出现在互联网上。简而言之，这份《宣言》（正文翻译见文末附录）向开发者呼吁：通过调整界面设计、提供 API 等方式，让用户能方便地通过链接访问应用内资源，从而提高工作效率、维持专注。

打个比方，如果你在笔记里写了一句「参见周一的会议记录」，那么应该能给「会议记录」四个字加上链接，点击后就能直接打开当时做记录的 Word 文档；在任务清单里写了一条「阅读某篇论文」，应该可以把「论文」链接到想要看的那份 PDF 文件。更理想地，你应该还能在上述 Word 或 PDF 文件中加一个反方向的链接，点击即可直接打开提到了它们的笔记或清单，方便继续写作、标记任务完成等。

如果你对近年红得发紫的「双向链接」笔记有所耳闻，应该会觉得上面的描述看着挺眼熟——这差不多就是将笔记场景中的双向链接推广和化用到了系统的各个角落。
确实，这些效果本来也不是什么「黑科技」，目前都能在某种程度上实现，只是远不够完美：要么依赖于应用和平台的特殊支持，但老死不相往来；要么薄如蝉翼，容易随着文件移动、设备更换而失效；要么晦涩难用，让普通用户一看就打消了学习的念头。
《泛在链接宣言》所呼吁的，正是让这种灵活的链接用法变得更通用、开放、稳固和易用。…</span>

                    <span>在每年的最后一个季度，下一年的新手帐本就逐渐上市，我会在预售阶段就挑选好新年的手帐。近些年来手帐市场不断回暖，不少人都准备在手帐上开启新的一年。手帐已经成为我生活中很重要的一部分。我用它规划时间、记录生活，随时随地写下自己的所见所感。在一年结束之时，面对满满一本的字迹与拼贴，回忆这一年里的点点滴滴，总能有别样感受。
什么是手帐？为什么需要一本手帐？
「手帐」（手帳，techō）是一个日语词，在中文中与之最相近的概念应当是「行事历」，但近年来手帐的流行趋势已经和只关注规划、待办事项的行事历有了区别。这件事同样体现在西方的手帐社区。当大家提及手帐时，使用的不只是代表行事历的「Planner」，更多的还有「Journal」——它除了记录待办事项、规划生活之外，还可以作为日记进行生活记录，用文字、插图、贴画等等一系列内容填充带有分区设计的本子，形成一个属于自己的生活轨迹地图。

手帐文化中，「自由度」是非常重要的元素。本质上，选择一本手帐的过程，就是设计自己的生活笔记体系的过程。每个人的需求各有不同，手帐社区中有不少人常常分享自己的手帐体系（比如上图的视频作者 AmandaRachLee，知名文具/日志/美妆 YouTuber），介绍手帐本的各种用法。也有很多资深用户在使用大量的量产手帐之后，选择自己购买空白本，从零开始设计这一年的手帐体系。所以我在这里需要强调，如果你想记录自己的生活，并不一定要购买专门的手帐本，你需要的只是一份持之以恒的心思，以及对自己生活的一些关注与反思，就能设计出最最适合自己的手帐体系。
但对于此前从未接触过手帐的人来说，想要入门手帐体系，最好还是从现成的专门手帐本入手。尤其已经经历大量市场考验的手帐品牌与型号，它们的本子设计已经经过了无数次调整（甚至每年都有…</span>

                    <span>2021 年已然接近尾声，以 Notion 为代表的「块编辑器」经过多年的发展也早已不是新鲜概念，成为了新兴文字编辑器的 de facto 交互选择。
Craft 在 1.0 时代就因其完整的文字编辑功能、优秀的共享协作体验，以及拥有非 electron-based 的跨 macOS、iOS、iPadOS 三大平台的原生客户端而饱受好评。Craft 让文字工作者在 Apple 生态圈中首次拥有了支持多人协作的原生「块编辑器」，且 Craft 目标明确 —— 专心做好以「原生客户端」为重心的线上文档协作、个人文档撰写的最佳工具。

事实上，Craft 1.0 也做到了这一点：专注文字撰写，放弃做一个「大一统」应用，让使用 Craft 的我们专注于自己的个性化 workflow，而非以应用本身为中心来调整自己。但我们在工作学习中，不可能全程使用同一个应用，我们需要浏览网站、浏览其他应用来获取信息，需要在应用中处理、编辑内容，需要将内容导出、发布、分享、汇总。为此，在 Craft 2.0 大版本更新中，Craft X —— Craft 自己的「插件、扩展系统」应运而生。
Craft X 设计理念
Craft eXtension，简称 Craft X，是 Craft 2.0 时代的重磅更新，为 Craft 核心编辑体验带来更多可能性。Craft X 的重点是一套完整的 Craft API，用来辅助我们在 Craft 中的工作流。其中我们在前文的介绍中所讲，Craft X 的设计理念…</span>

它是做卫生的大魔王工具
是的，我认为它是整理家庭卫生的「大魔王」。没有它处理不了的污渍。无论是泼在地上的汤汤水水，还是洒在地上的颜料，抑或是顽固的油污，抱歉，蒸汽拖把没在怕的。有它在基本上不存在解决不了的地面污渍。
出国在外，很长一段时间家里是我妈在做卫生，所以我一直不知道家里卫生是怎么做的。等我回来，我才发现家里换了个我没见过的玩意儿。后来才知道是蒸汽拖把。回来后就换我做家里的卫生，于是第一项任务就是解决家里厨房那被油烟熏入味儿的地面。
怎么说那个地面呢，就像是地表有一层浅浅的胶水，拖鞋走上去、抬起来，会发出「嘶啦」的声音，粘滞感有，但没有那么强，属于那种让你能感觉得到，却不会造成你行动不便的程度。毫不夸张地说，拖一遍以后，地砖就发出了光泽。你能明显感觉到那股粘滞感已经基本消失。拖鞋踩在上面再也没有那种「嘶啦声」发出。一切顺滑，恢复了地砖该有的平滑感觉。
效果真的显著
它是洗地机吗
先说结论，它「不是」洗地机。
借着这次搬家，我才想着说，把这东西拎出来讲一讲。一开始我以为这东西挺冷门，最后在飞书群一问，挺多人想看看的。
可能初看很多人都会认为这是个洗地机。其实它是蒸汽拖把哒（DIO 脸）！最常见的洗地机我相信大家都看过，就是某些型号的洒水车。我们平时路上会见到那种车身两边带着旋转型刷头的那种洒水车，就是比较常见的「洗地机」。体积笨重、需要一定的操作能力。然后再简化一下，就是家用的洗地机了。
比较好一点的家用洗地机，就是 KARCHER 的洗地机。刚解除隔离的那天，我就迫不及待地驱车去家附近的山姆会员店逛逛了。刚好电器区有 KAR…</span>

From Warner Bros. Pictures comes Matt Reeves’ “The Batman,” starring Robert Pattinson in the dual role of Gotham City’s vigilante detective and his alter ego, reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne. Starring alongside Pattinson (“Tenet,” “The Lighthouse”) as Gotham’s famous and infamous cast of characters are Zoë Kravitz (“Big Little Lies,” “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald”) as Selina Kyle; Paul Dano (“Love &amp; Mercy,” “12 Years a Slave”) as Edward Nashton; Jeffrey Wrig…</span>

                    <span>Nearly a year ago I deployed a multiplayer feature for Farmhand, an open source and web-based farming game that I created. Since that initial deployment, the multiplayer system has experienced no downtime or service degradation. And best of all, I&#x27;ve paid nothing to host the service and therefore I am able to allow others to play for free. This article is an overview of how I designed this system from the ground up.
In short, Farmhand is a game that mixes farming and market mechanics. The goal is to buy seeds for a low price, plant and harvest them, and then sell the crops at a high price. Prices fluctuate from day-to-day, so you&#x27;ll have to be smart about your buy/sell decisions.
Farmhand was initially designed as a single-player game and seed/crop values were randomly generated at the sta…</span>

Hi, José,
Masakazu Mori (He made a presentation at ElixirConf US 2021 [1]) and I lecture the course &quot;Programming Theory&quot; at the University of Kitakyushu, including the mainstream programming paradigms: imperative programming, OOP, and functional programming, relating to the history of the architecture of the computer systems. Of course, one of the course&#x27;s main topics is &quot;Why Elixir?&quot;. In Programming Elixir [2], Dave Thomas said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to hide data. I want to transform it.&quot; I identified this consideration as a new programming paradigm instead of functional programming: The data transformation paradigm.
So, I want to interview you about the history of what you consider about desig…</span>

                    <span>When I first moved to vim from and ide like vscode or sublime text one of my very first issues was trying to preview my website at localhost:8000.  There had always just been a button there to do it in all of my other editors, not vim.  There are not many buttons for anything in vim.  While there is probably a plugin that can run a webserver for me in vim, it&#x27;s not necessary, we just need the command line we are already in.
You will need a way to run another process alongside vim, here are a couple ideas to get you going that are not the focus here.style
use background jobs


c-z to send a job to the background
fg to bring it back
use a second terminal
use a second tab
use tmux and run it in a separate split/window

                    <span>Depois de várias tentativas sem sucesso, enfim consegui virtualizar um macOS para fazer testes em um aplicativo iOS no qual eu estava trabalhando.
Mas antes de continuar, é necessário saber que essa não é uma solução estável e possue diversos problemas de desempenho, porém, para meu propósito consegui fazer o que queria.
Nós utilizaremos o QEMU para emular um macOS e dentro dele, utilizaremos o xCode para emular um iOS, só nisso você já consegue perceber que não vai ser uma coisa leve.
O repositório no github do Docker OSX tem uma explicação de como usar um iPhone via usb ao invés de emular, mas eu não tenho iPhone :p

I would like to analyze this result, but this data is compressed.
In this Section. I&#x27;ll explain about dns compression.
According to  (RFC1035)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035], We can specify the location to be referenced by OFFSET in the following format.
a domain name represented as a sequence of labels, where each label consists of a length octet followed by that number of octets.  

The domain name terminates with the zero length octet for the null label of the root.

                    <span>Oh the technical interviews, I am a 15 years experienced software engineer and I&#x27;m still afraid of them!. So we as human beings fear the unknown, but a good interview should be more like a conversation instead of a police interrogation.
Interviewers have asked me if I know S.O.L.I.D. principles, unit testing in deep and even I&#x27;ve been asked to use graph theory to solve a problem. When I got the job, there is a high dependency on a specific dll that do a lot of different things (This by it&#x27;s own violates all SOLID principles), I never used anything they asked me, so what&#x27;s the need to make the technical interview unnecessarily complex and tedious?. When I am interviewing a candidate I try to make a conversation like: Tell me about your experience, the latest project you are working on, what technology you like the most, and why. I guess that they are trying to emulate top-tech companies like GAFAM, what I have heard about these companies is that the technical interviews are very focused on data structures and problem-solving (not sure if they are used in daily work).
My point is: if your company focuses on a specific product, ask what you&#x27;re looking for, ask for the technologies you are currently using, please stop doing stupidly complex technical tests unless your company is currently using these techniques to solve complex problems.
And as always, happy coding!.</span>

                    <span>This tutorial was originally published here.
Welcome to the Secrets of MicroPython tutorial series! MicroPython is an incredible tool for rapidly prototyping and iterating on hardware projects. It&#x27;s similar to Arduino but instead of using C++, which you have to re-compile each time you make a code change, it runs on the Python interpreter which allows you to run code changes immediately. The quick feedback cycle enabled by MicroPython will, I believe, power the future of embedded development.
What is the &quot;hello world&quot; of embedded software? Why, blinking an LED, of course! In this first tutorial, we&#x27;ll get you acquainted with the fundamentals of MicroPython and more importantly, the online simulator we&#x27;ll be using for all the tutorials. That&#x27;s right, an online simulator! No need to feel pre…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on my website for some time now, but it felt like there was something missing. I wasn&#x27;t really sure what it was, so I ignored it for a bit of time. Later that week, I was hanging out with friends and we started making puns about ducks- &quot;wisequacks&quot;. That&#x27;s when I had a moment of realization. 
I decided to drop everything that I was doing and build a really simple API for duck jokes. Right now the API has a couple of jokes, but we need some more, so if you want to submit some, you can respond to this issue or you can just drop a pull request on this repository. 
You can check out the joke API here and you can use it in any of your projects if you would like. All of the code for the project can be found in the linked repository and it is all under the MIT license if you want to use it in your own project. Cheers! 
Make Sure to Drop the Repository a Star if You Like It!

                    <span>一、前言
众所周知，Android中是通过WindowManger来添加、删除和更新视图，也就是WindowManager提供的addView、removeView和updateViewLayout方法。但是在添加或移除View的代码逻辑是啥，在这期间做了哪些工作，调用removeView方法就真的立刻删除view了吗？本文正是针对这些问题，对相关系统源码做了一次梳理和分析。作为一次学习源码过程，希望对相关知识点做到既能用，也明白底层原理。
在详细梳理代码前，首先我们先明确一下View的这些操作方法在哪里声明的，实现是怎样的，调用链路是啥。
1、「增删改」的View操作方法都是在ViewManager接口中声明的
public interface ViewManager
{
    /**
     * Assign the passed LayoutParams to the passed View and add the view to the window.
     * 
Throws {@link android.view.WindowManager.BadTokenException} for certain programming
     * errors, such as adding a second view to a window without removing the first view.
     * 
Throws {@link android.view.WindowManager.InvalidDisplayException} if the window is on a
     * secondary {@link Display} and the specified display can&#x27;t be found

                    <span>现在你已经很难找到一款带有 3.5mm 耳机插孔的数码设备了。
这或许是厂商「希望」听音乐不再有线材的束缚，也或许是真的技术发展所致导致设备已经容纳不了一个小小的 3.5mm 耳机接口了，似乎真的要和有线耳机拜拜了？除了换成「真无线耳机」之外，有没有什么办法让我们耗费巨资购买的有线耳机也能赶上时代，重新在手机上继续发光发热，甚至可以兼顾无线耳机的便携性以及高保真耳机的高音质呢？
传统耳机也能「无线听歌」
上面一大段并非是个人臆想，而是自己的亲身经历——拥有一条四千块大洋拿下的威士顿 W50，又换上了索尼的 MUC-M12SM2 耳机线——我希望既不需要更换手上的高品质设备，又能「无线听歌」。
好在威士顿 W50 采用的是 MMCX 插孔的可换线设计，因此变成蓝牙耳机其实并不复杂——再买一个索尼 MUC-M2BT1 蓝牙耳机的适配器就可以秒变挂脖式的蓝牙耳机。因为原生支持 LDAC 无线蓝牙技术，这样实现即保证了音质（CD 级别的无损音频传输），又摆脱的线材的束缚。不过这种解决方案也存在不方便之处，一方面是想再次换回 3.5mm 耳机插孔的时候，需要频繁地换线插拔接口，另一方面就是无法预测蓝牙适配器的电量使用情况，经常听到一半突然没电。更重要的是，我的索尼 MUC-M12SM2 耳机线就无用武之地了。
可将任意 2.5/3.5mm 有线耳机「蓝牙化」
所以拿到飞傲 BTR5 2021 时，我第一时间就是将耳机线接了回去，然后将它和我的安卓手机进行蓝牙配对——BTR5 2021 支持 LDAC 蓝牙音频协议，至少保证了最为基本的无损音质（接近 CD 品质的无损音频），而 3.5mm 耳机口的输出让我不用频繁换线就能继续使用我的 W50。
也可有线获得更高音质
BTR5 2021 还标配一个小夹子水晶壳，出街的时候可以非常方便地夹在衣服或者裤子口袋中，还自带一个小的麦克风，有电话…</span>

                    <span>人类种植稻米的历史起源于中国。大米作为市面上最常见也是最为人所熟知的主食，经过数以千年记的发展、改良和创新，已经成为全球产量第二的食物。1中国自古就有「鱼米之乡」等词汇，充分体现了大米对于中国百姓生活的影响。而法国名厨乔治斯·奥古斯特·艾斯可菲（1848–1935）也曾感叹：「米饭是世界上最好、最营养的——而且毫无疑问，它也是最普遍的主食。」由此不难看出，无论对于东方还是西方人，米饭都有这独特而浓厚的吸引力。
那么，作为一种看似平凡却又历史悠久的食物，我们又有哪些方法可以在家庭餐桌上折腾出新花样呢？今天本文就列举一些好吃又好看的碳水大餐！
开篇之前：袁隆平大米上架少数派商城啦
蒸一碗热腾腾的米饭，再炒两个快手菜，能让胃和身体都温暖起来，驱走冬日的严寒。我们也专门为我派读者们准备了由国货品牌「隆平农场」出品的高品质大米「袁隆平大米」。这款大米产自东北辽河，从苗种到耕种都经过精心培育，好吃不贵。
「袁隆平大米」5 公斤装原价 79 元，我派商城特惠价 69 元。

基础材料和准备
既然聊米饭的烹饪，那重头戏当然就是米啦。我家的口味是喜欢吃东北大米，口感圆润，极富光泽感，颗粒分明又入口软糯，看着一碗可爱蓬蓬的、发亮的米饭总是会有幸福感，有时都不需要太多配菜，好的米干吃起来都不至于乏味涩嘴，并且煮干煮稀都适用，既可以粒粒分明也可以浓浓汤水。
我认为好好吃饭是生活中看似日常却会潜移默化影响身心的事情，越基础的食材越重要。有时宁愿多肥两斤，也不愿放弃碳水的快乐。

家电厨具就是电饭煲、砂锅等一般家庭中都有配备的用品，只是煮白米饭的话用电饭锅就可以了，方便又快捷。不过依据我的个人经验，电饭煲的价格、工艺对煮出来的饭确实是有一定影响的，在米本身处于及格线的情况下，更好的材质、设计、用料能让同一款米的食用体验更上档次。
砂锅作为传统烹饪工具，在有时间的情况下选用它更能…</span>

Apple Music：2021 音乐回忆
如往常一样，Apple Music 2021 音乐回忆带你回顾一年中最爱的音乐与艺人。在 Apple Music 的「现在就听」页面下拉至底部，就能找到「音乐回忆」栏目。这一歌单其实在今年 2 月份就已经支持添加到资料库了，并且支持每周动态更新。
如果你没有找到，可以点击 这个链接 在网页端打开后生成「音乐回忆 2021」播放列表，并添加到资料库。
「音乐回忆」会根据你在 Apple Music 上的所有听歌记录，统计两类年度数据，分别是播放次数最多的歌曲排行 Top 100、累计播放时间最长的艺人排行。对于单首歌曲、艺人，还会标注累计的总时长信息。除了查看官方生成的「音乐回忆」外，你还可以将「音乐回忆」添加到 Apple Music 形成播放列表。

除了「音乐回忆」外，在 12 月 1 日，Apple 上线了 2021 年 Apple Music 榜单。你可以在 Apple Music 搜索「2021 Top songs」或者是「百大」等关键词查看。2021 年 Apple Music 全球榜中最受欢迎的歌曲是防弹少年团的 Dynamite，其次是 Ariana Grande 的 Positions，接下来是史墨克的 For The Night 。
除了全球外，Apple Music 还针对不同国家和地区推出了 Top 100，比如 中国大陆地区 依然是被周杰伦霸榜，甚至 Top 10 中有 9 首都是周杰伦的歌曲。港澳地区 Top 1 则是林家谦 一人之境 in C maj…</span>

作为如今生活中不可或缺的一种文件格式，PDF 承载了太多内容形式 —— 海报、画册、宣传页、合同、报价单、教科书…… 其中可能需要签字、修改、阅读、批注的，也不在少数。现在，一直以来仅在 Windows 上有客户端的 PDF 标注软件 Drawboard PDF 也已经登陆 iOS 和 iPadOS，就让我们一探究竟。

在 iOS 和 iPadOS 上，Drawboard PDF 用起来怎么样？和 iPadOS 自带的 PencilKit，或者是 GoodNotes 一类笔记软件相比，Drawboard PDF 有什么优劣？在 iOS 上批注 PDF 方式如此之多的今日，Drawboard 是否值得迁移？

相信看完这篇文章，上面的几个问题，你的心中都会有满意的答案。
从各处打开 PDF 文档，还可以免费创建空白文档
如果你和我一样是 Drawboard 的新用户，打开 Drawboard PDF 的那一刻，app 会提示登录账户。除了可以使用传统的邮箱注册之外，当然也可以使用 Apple ID 来登录；或者，Drawboard PDF 也提供了不登录直接使用 Essentials 基本功能的选项。如果在体验后你发现自己无需使用高级功能，那么不注册账号也完全不会影响到 Drawboard PDF 的使用 —— 清爽、简单、直接，这也是 Drawboard PDF 给我的第一感觉。

2021 年 11 月 12 日早上 9:09，还没有把工位的椅子捂热乎，我收到了三周前预定的新 MacBook Pro 14。

这篇文章的主角不是它，但也因它而起。
在这之前，我自己的主力机是 2015 年的 MacBook Pro 13，和一台 15 年组装的 PC ，显卡还是 750 Ti。今年 618 的时候，买了一台明基 PD2705Q 2K 显示器替换掉了原来的 AOC 的某款忘记型号的 1080P 显示器。因为知道下半年 Apple 一定会发布新的 MacBook Pro，所以我在挑选显示器的时候，除了色彩之外最看重的可能就是 Type-C 反向供电功能了，我不太想本来就很小的桌面空间上还有各种各样的线。
但是都 2021 年了，我为什么还要买一台 2K 分辨率的显示器呢？看我当时的主力设备就知道了，老 Mac 加老 PC 组合，我尝试过 4K 显示器，买的是 PHILIPS-279C9，买回来之后发现有一些色偏，背光不均匀以及电脑会卡……于是我就退掉了，换成现在这款，他满足了我对色彩、价格、Type-C 供电等等一切需求，唯有分辨率是硬伤了。
不过 2K 也还好，PC 下没有问题，老 MBP 上也可以开启 HiDPI，并没有感到有很强的颗粒感。对于 Intel 系列的 MacBook Pro 开启 HiDPI 的方式，是按照我派的 这一篇文章 进行设置的。
一切的美好都在我连上了新的 MacBook Pro 之后结束了……

                    <span>2021 年是 Epic Games 公司成立 30 周年，在科技产业，这足以称得上是一家“老”公司。但这家公司为更广泛的科技圈以及大众所认知，好像也就只在最近几年。在过去一段时间里，元宇宙 (metaverse) 概念兴起，Epic 凭借虚幻引擎 (Unreal Engine, UE) 和社交游戏堡垒之夜 (Fortnite: Battle Royale)，从一家游戏开发商的定位，跃升到了离元宇宙最近的少数几家公司之一。
玩家群体对 Epic Games 当然不陌生，不少 3A 级的游戏都通过虚幻引擎开发。对于海外玩家来说，Epic 旗下的堡垒之夜最高月活跃用户在 2020 年超过了 8000 万，是海外最受欢迎的竞技类游戏。在过去几年，美国的中学和大学举办电竞，最多人参与的项目必然是堡垒之夜。对于中国玩家来说，备受关注的黑神话：悟空就是使用 UE5 开发，并且得到了 Epic 官方的技术支持。Epic Games 也在不同场合秀出 UE5 的“肌肉”，包括在 PS5 主机上的实机展示，最近也有黑客帝国：觉醒的 demo 供玩家体验。
黑客帝国：觉醒 demo
在相当一段时间以来，Epic 是我最感兴趣的公司之一。我在美国读书的时候，学校离 Epic 总部只有 20 分钟车程。Epic 所在的北卡州 Cary 市是一个富人小镇，也是一个 foodie town。虽然我也偶尔去 Cary 饕餮一番，但却没有机会走近 Epic 一睹真容。但因为离得不远，也结识了几个在 Epic 工作的朋友。

少年极客


Tim Sweeney 1970 年出生于美国东海岸马里兰州 Potomac 市，是家中三兄弟里面年纪最小的一个。Tim 的两个哥哥分别比他年长 15 岁和 10 岁——当 Tim 开始读小学时，两个哥哥离家读大学甚至已经毕业了，因此 Tim 在成年以前的大部分时间更像是家中独子，受到父母的关照。


和很多天才极客的成长故事类似，Tim Sweeney 在年幼的时候就喜欢捣鼓各类工具和机械设备。他曾经把家里的收音机、电视机和割草机 (一般美国家庭用来除草和平整草坪) 逐一拆解，来研究机械的运作原理。在五岁时，Tim 把家里的割草机拆解，然后再重新组装成一辆能够驾驶的卡丁车。他对于各种机械的兴趣，后来也逐渐延伸到了计算机和各类技术领域。


七十年代，电子游戏行业开始逐渐在美国建立。Noland Bushnell 在 1972 年创立雅达利 (Atari) 公司，并且相继推出了第一款在商业上取得成功的街机游戏 Pong 和后来风靡全球的 Space Invaders (国内玩家称为“小蜜蜂”，雅达利从日本大东公司购买了版权)，依靠投币式街机的游戏厅也开始在美国流行。Tim 十岁时，离家里不远处开了一家游戏厅，和很多青少年一样，Tim 也在里面流连忘返。后来，父母干脆买了一台 Atari 2600 家…</span>

B.T
名“Dio”与姓“Brando”则来自分别现实中著名的重金属摇滚乐队DIO，以及著名演员马龙·白兰度
P.S：意大利语中，“dio”意为神明
DIO，美国重金属摇滚乐队，成立于1982年。成员包括主唱罗尼·詹姆斯·迪欧(DIO)、吉他手安东尼·伊奥米、鼓手威廉·沃德、贝斯手泰伦斯·巴特勒马龙·白兰度（Marlon Brando），美国著名影视演员、导演。代表作《教父》
乔纳森·乔斯达
大乔的形象应该出自原创，但名字的来历就有很多说法了
起初，荒木老师在06年特别访谈中说是家庭餐厅的名字（Jonathan)，因为最初在这家餐厅与编辑讨论漫画，所以以此命名。这应该是大家都听说过的
不过后来，荒木又在JOJOVELLER HISTORY中亲口否认了这点。椛岛良介也表示最初是在另一家餐厅进行磋商的，连载途中才变更到Jonathan。 
JOJOVELLER HISTORY
但事实上，日本关东确实有一个大型连锁家庭餐厅，名字也确实是乔纳森
Jonathan
关于前后表述不一问题，荒木老师本人是这样解释的 ↓↓↓
JOJOVOLLER HISTORY
别问，问就是老师自己也忘了
P.S：网上流传有另一种说法：在著名吸血鬼题材小说，爱尔兰作家斯托克的《德古拉》中，有一名重要角色名字即为乔纳森。
威廉·A·齐贝林
齐贝林家族的姓氏，来自于英国摇滚乐队Led Zeppelin（齐贝林飞艇）

                    <span>提到JOJO中的超自然力量，大概诸位都会想到替身、波纹、与吸血鬼
不过，你是否会想到罗马占卜术，暗杀风水学呢？
这篇文章，会粗浅整理JOJO世界观下的超自然力量体系。展现一个，JOJO式的奇妙世界之冰山一角

本文分三部分，分别为『基本世界』『新世界』『番外』
顾名思义，基本世界为1-6部，新世界为第七部往后的作品，番外则是《岸边露伴一动不动》《死神之Q》等非正篇内容

起点——基本世界

与传统血族不同的是，他们不惧怕流水，洋葱，银，十字架等等“吸血鬼克制物”。
1.1、尸生人
原文为『zombie』（僵尸）
由吸血鬼对人类或尸体进行转化，制造出的物种，身体力量强于人类，听命于制造者
2、夜之一族（闇之一族）
アイアイアァァァ
上古生物，族人被称为『柱中人』，位于地球食物链顶端的生物，是一切生物的天敌，以吸血鬼为食
身体强度极强，拥有比吸血鬼更强大的力量，速度，和细胞活性。能通过接触同化细胞的方式吞噬其他生物
2.1、流法
夜之一族（柱男）通过开发身体完成的，近似于魔法的技术
2.2、石鬼面（石之假面）
设定集

                    <span>身为一名替身使者你应该了解的知识
替身，STAND，JOJO系列作品中最核心的设定，也是日本战斗漫画史上的一个独特旗帜
本文将深入整理讨论替身设定，围绕替身体系最基础的『规则』展开

目录

基础设定（来自飙马野郎第十卷）
替身规则与逾矩者
STAND or 幽波纹？
你可以这样成为替身使者
替身的分类

一、基础设定
“无”中生不出“有”来，此乃世人常用的表现句子之一
不过那是“仅止于过去的表现句”
现代物理学已经证实在毫无一物的“无”&#x3D;“绝对真空”当中……有时会突然产生出名为“素粒子”的超微小粒子[1]
而……“素粒子”能够变化出能量来，也就是说素粒子会突然变成能量，然后突然又凭空消失
刚刚所提到的“素粒子”并不是发生在遥远的宇宙彼端，或仅存于理论当中的事情
而是在这地球的日常生活当中，也随时随地都在发生，相当不足为奇的事情
以上述这些知识为前提，在《JOJO的奇妙冒险》这部作品当中，为求方便，个人便将由人类所引发出来的这股精神能量称之为“替身”
本作品将以绘画（或是影像）来表现这股目不可视的“精神能量”
例如会有这样的表现方式：

在人类或动物的背后，其精神层面将会以经过设计的角色图案浮现出来
此角色（指疯狂钻石）要是以拳头攻击，现实世界的物质就会遭到破坏

有时其精神层面会依附在“刀剑”或“手枪”等武器当中再浮现出来
也有些会附着在“人偶”、“卡片、扑克牌”、“船”、“车”、“锁”、“文字”等道具或日常物品当中。它们都会有所动作，或是进行攻击
（图中为阿努比斯神、性感手枪、黑檀木恶魔、欧里西斯神、力、命运之轮、心锁、天堂之门。对应黑体字）

也有的精神层面是以很小型，数量却很多的形状表现出来
有的会以部分肉体显露出来
（图中为收成者、女皇、迷途猫）
而拥有以心灵看见“替身”的才能之人……称为“替身使者”

                    <span>【小记】
一场疫情似乎把所有出境旅行的计划都打破了，但却让我们又一次发现我大中华的锦绣山河，这么的绝美又壮阔；它的云朵不像 瑞士 ，山脉不像阿尔卑斯，它不用模仿任何地方，它有属于自己的名字，它就叫 新疆 巩留 …


【快乐的定格照片】
对于 新疆 的印象是从小时候姥爷给我带回来的红色花帽，色彩浓烈，挂满了漂亮的玻璃珠子~再后来就是跟AJ恋爱后一起去的 喀纳斯 跟 禾木 村，零下40°的冬天，坐雪地摩托他直接把脸冻伤了哈哈哈。
这次来 巩留 就是无意间看到了云杉林，自驾在 新疆 的无界草原可以拥抱最清新的氧气，没有过多的游客，是一片还没沾染凡尘的人间仙境…
忘不了泛着青蓝色湖水的恰甫其海…

忘不了光着脚踩在 库尔 德宁的秘密森林…

忘不了阳光白云下的云杉林...

忘不了下着暴雨，雪山渐渐隐去的恰西山顶…

忘不了 塔里 木途中的原始哈萨克木屋…

忘不了经常拦路的羊咩咩和牧羊人，有时候还有牧羊犬...

我遗忘在那里的记忆太多太多，以至于现在看到某张照片会突然笑起来，阳光天也好，暴雨倾盆也罢，都是旅行画笔下的一抹彩虹。

巩留 ，这是在 伊犁 的一个小县城，但真论起来它也不小，土地面积4528平方千米你感受一下哈哈。静静的坐落在 伊犁 河谷中，于 伊犁 河的上游而生，网上关于它的信息特别少，所以我做足了攻略才决定出发。

【行程】
Day1： 北京 — 伊犁 — 巩留
Day2：恰甫其海— 库尔 德宁
Day3： 塔里 木风景区—恰西风景区
Day4：野核桃沟—蝶湖
Day5： 巩留 — 伊犁 市区— 北京
【交通】
1、 北京 — 伊宁 — 巩留
我是从 北京 出发，首都机场飞 伊宁 （中途会在 克拉玛依 经停），飞行时长6H左右；然后自驾前往 巩留 2H。
2、 上海 / 江苏 —（ 乌鲁木齐 ）— 伊宁 — 巩留

                    <span>You missed THIS in Gladiator. When Maximus makes his first appearance in the Colosseum, he asks the men fighting with him if any of them “ever served in the army” to which one replies that he served with him at Vindobona. This shows that even though Maximus has been trying to keep his identity a secret, at least one other prisoner has known who he was the entire time and never said a thing, because that’s how much respect Maximus commanded from his men.

                    <span>Watch as Marines surprise this World War Two veteran.

When Marines arrived in Port Everglades for Fleet Week, the local sheriff informed them that there was a true war hero who lived nearby, and that he had a very particular problem the Marines might be able to help him with. 

The man was a Marine aviator who piloted planes in World War Two and had over a hundred combat missions in the Korean War. Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. 

Captain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.</span>

Hello, people! You probably already saw or read one of those articles like “Web developer roadmap in 2021”, “How to become a web developer”, etc. So, I also wanted to share my perspective on this topic that might be useful to some people who are at the start of their exciting journey or open some discussion with others.

Learning Web in 2021 is not a straight line (Photo by Mark König on Unsplash)
I want to start with the most basic and the important, as well as, sometimes, overlooked part of the Web — HTML. Why overlooked? Thanks to some great JavaScript frameworks, like React, web developers frequently deal with “components” rather than HTML elements.

A lot of performance issues can be improved using cache, there is a lot of tools out here but for this brief tutorial I&#x27;ll choose the well-known Nginx.
You can clone the branch nginx-cache or follow this tutorial (I&#x27;ll only cover the nginx stuff)

I&#x27;ll use an app from previous post of mine, which calculates the nth fibonacci result given a number. The app it self is very simple and you can see it very small piece of code from the (repository)[https://github.com/iamseki/dev-to] that I mentioned before.

How is a world created? (Worldbuilding)
In Worldbuilding there is two methods of creation, the first is called &quot;top-down&quot;, where you create the world&#x27;s cultures, its inhabitants, civilizations and then the geographic features, it&#x27;s the option that i will try to avoid, since i want to create the world historically, so from year 0 to year i-dont-know. The other method is the first but inverted, so it&#x27;s called &quot;bottom-up&quot;, where you create the geographic features, such as continents, tectonic plates, biomes and then the cultures, civilizations and more. I will try to use the &quot;bottom-up&quot; method, it&#x27;s just what i want. 
I want to create a world organically, so as i&#x27;m going to use the &quot;bottom-up&quot; method, i will create the world terrain first and then adapt the cultures on it. So, …</span>

                    <span>Heya! The final part of this twitter bot series is here. 
In the first part of this series, we&#x27;ve taken a look at creating a twitter bot in .NET that listens to particular tweets and retweets them. For the second part we created Api endpoints for  it, so it now has the capability to change its tweet stream rules whilst listening at the same time. This final part is where we deploy our twitter bot to the Pi, lets go!
his is the link to the repo (here). It includes the previous changes as well as what will occur during the course of this blog.
In order for this to work, we will need a couple of things to have at hand:
A Raspberry Pi
Setting up the Pi with SSH (link here)


Please take note of the OS chosen during the setup for later

                    <span>Hello! Welcome to this first post in a series where we try to build our own deep learning library in Python.
In this post, we will go begin to write a simple feedforward neural network. 
We will only work on the forward pass in this post and we will work on training our network in the next post.
This post will cover how basic feedforward neural networks take in a input and produce an output from it. 
Neural networks are a machine learning technique which is loosely inspired by the model of the brain.
As with all machine learning techniques, it learns from a dataset which contains inputs and their corresponding outputs.
Neural networks consist of layers. Each layer is connected to the next layer with weights and biases. These weights and biases are used by the network to calculate the outpu…</span>

                    <span>Any developer knows how difficult it can be to find the right code online that is safe, secure and reliable. We use these building blocks as a basis to build programs, but searching for this code online can be time consuming, not to mention untrustworthy. You may spend precious time sourcing code that turns out to be outdated or unsafe, leading to a lot of wasted time that could have been avoided. 
At Codiga, we firmly believe that whether you work alone or with a team of developers, coding should be a truly collaborative experience. Being able to share and receive code patterns from other developers that you trust can save you an infinite amount of time and minimize the amount of potential mistakes.

                    <span>O Que é o Sentry?
Basicamente, o sentry é uma ferramenta que nos auxilia na captura de erros que acontecem nas nossas aplicações em modo debug e também em produção.
é só isso mesmo!!!
Bora ver como isso funciona?

Crie uma conta no sentry


Vai em Criar um projeto e selecione a plataforma ( no nosso caso, REACT NATIVE ) e clica em Criar projeto.





  
  
  Agora no nosso projeto React Native


1 - Instalar a biblioteca de integração do Sentry com o React Native.
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
# or
yarn add @sentry/react-native

2 - Adicionar o Sentry no nosso aplicativo
Você pode adicionar a chamada do sentry no seu app.js ou app.ts da seguinte maneira:
import * as Sentry from &quot;@sentry/react-native&quot;;

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SUA_DSN_AQUI
});

Sua DSN aparece logo após você criar o seu projeto React Native na plataforma do Sentry
3 - Faça o build da sua aplicação novamente
 yarn android 
 ou
 yarn ios

E pronto, sua aplicação agora está sendo monitorada pelo sentry, e qualquer erro ele vai te mostrar em uma dashboard da plataforma.
Você também consegue ver algumas métricas do dispositivo do usuário, como:
Nível de bateria, network que estava sendo utilizada no momento do crash, IP e etc...
É isso galera, qualquer dúvida deixe nos comentários :D</span>
