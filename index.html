Learning to code is about more than just getting a job.
People may have different opinions on what is important for a successful life. 
Here are a few ways that learning to code can help you get ahead in life:
Programming is all about solving problems. In order to write a successful program, you need to be able to think logically and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
This type of thinking is useful in any field. If you can learn to think like a programmer, you&#x27;ll be better equipped to solve problems and find creative solutions in any area of life.
In programming, even the smallest mistake can cause your entire program to break. As a result, programmers have to be extremely detail-oriented.

What is Penetration Testing?
The idea behind any penetration testing is to identify security-related vulnerabilities in a software application by conducting a security attack to determine how much damage a hacker may cause when trying to hack the product. The results of this practice help to make applications and software more secure, robust, and unbreakable, and the users’ experience – more successful.

                              <span>At Specify, we want to help you work better as a product team. As a developer, one of your job is to implement design tokens in your codebase. And let&#x27;s face it, manually updating design data is cumbersome.
Specify helps you collect design data from Figma and distribute it in the right format, in the right project, at the right time, and to top it all: automatically.
Let&#x27;s see how to sync design tokens and assets from Figma to a React Native project.
We&#x27;ll pull design data from the following Specify repository:

We&#x27;ll generate the following files:
🗂 output
├── theme.ts
├── 🗂 fonts
└── 🗂 vectors

Before anything else, please make sure you have:
created a Specify account
collected design data from Figma to a Specify repository

                              <span>What is Automation Testing?


Automation testing is a critical component of the software development life cycle. It is the practice of running tests on software or websites with minimal human interaction. It&#x27;s the most effective way to ensure that your code is tested in a consistent and repeatable manner, which improves the quality of your software applications and allows you to fix problems or avoid mistakes that would otherwise be difficult to detect manually. Because it allows for repeatable and consistent results over time, automation testing is more efficient than manual testing.
With Testsigma, a powerful open source test automation platform for web apps, mobile apps, and APIs, you can build stable and reliable end-to-end tests at DevOps speed!

                              <span>The number of internet users has increased massively in the past few years, and handling this enormous amount of traffic is a big challenge for application developers. Choosing an appropriate architecture for communication between the server and clients plays a significant role in ensuring that traffic is kept at a manageable level.
In this article, you’re going to learn about the push and pull architecture of network communications, and how push architecture can limit the load on your application server, increasing performance.
There are two primary approaches to network communications—push and pull.
Pull: Often referred to as polling, it’s especially common on the internet. A client, such as: a user, web browser, or application, etc. requests information and the server responds with the …</span>

*Basic Syntax *
Data types and structures 
String – Holds a sequence of characters, i.e., &quot;Hello World. &quot;


Boolean –Logical true or false data, i.e, true, false


Integers – Reprints whole numbers i.e -5,0,123


Arrays – Collects data of similar type


Characters – use of symbols from a defined mapping of integral values to symbols.



Data structures, however, are a collection of data values. They include operations that can be applied to the data…</span>

m1 max 运行着一个程序，需要一直联网，房东宽带有断网的可能性，虽然一年可能就一两次。但是现在要求不能断网，有啥好便宜实用方案？我想到的是买流量卡，缺点是可能信号比较差，因为本身流量不会使用很多，配合以下设备使用
1 、能插 sim 卡的路由器，路由器电源还要插着电。。万一断电，，也是问题，再配个路由器电源？
2 、二手手机插在电脑上，价格可能比路由器贵？
其他方案暂未想到。。</span>

如题，客户经理一般报价只会告诉你 139 和 169 的融合套餐，融合套餐都有一年合约。这时候你可以直接让他申请 99 的竞品套餐，300M 无合约，但是需要提供移动 /联通的光猫照片，还有对应运营商每月的资费情况，这个资费必须比电信的低！！ 跟客户经理沟通的时候我表示需要公网 ip ，也很干脆的就答应了。但是这个是先装宽带，才能去领卡，而且公网 ip 是安装后 24 小时才给开通，我今天约了师傅安装，公网 ip 到手再来更新。
希望给准备装电信宽带的 xdm 提供点参考。
ps：现在办卡有点麻烦，7 月底上面发了通知 每个人不能超过 5 张电话卡，而且办卡的时候还要我出示了社保卡，如果没有社保卡就要居住证，不然没法办理。</span>

结果，第二天下午爱快的工作人员就打过来电话，提醒我路由器掉线了，细思极恐，原来我的一举一动都在爱快的监控之下，如果想监控网络流量也不是不可能。
//
以下是通话录音文字版：
爱快：喂你好
本人：电脑，还是机器人(我自己对电话机器人的图灵测试)
爱快：你好，我是爱快路由器的，跟你联系是你的爱快设备离线了，你到时候检查一下好吗。如果是我们的问题请随时来电。
本人：哦
爱快：好的不打扰你了再见。(挂机)

简述一下需求
体验不错：不需要旗舰级别，但我现在用的是一加 7pro （ 855+8G+256G ），总不能比这还差吧（底线是 870 ？现在旗舰 CPU 到底发展到怎么样了？），然后 NFC 、wifi6 、通话录音等等也尽量要有。
原生谷歌：我日常软件强绑定 Google Play 生态，需要能够在不刷机不 root 的情况下稳定保证这台机器生命周期内能用谷歌（有些解锁的方法属于灰色地带，过几年会失效；刷机 root 的话可能会有些游戏和软件不支持，我也不想花太多精力去伪装等等，万一搞封号了划不来）
国行或渠道可靠带保修：我是一个重要电子产品只信任京东自营的人，哪怕是最后购买了海外版，也希望不要是什么淘宝代购之类的不是特别有保障的渠道。
和隔壁 /t/870218 比，预算可以更高一点，我一加 7pro 是首发的，基本可以瞄准同定位的现款机。</span>

请问有没有办法在保留数据的情况下，把这个硬盘从一个虚拟机挂载到另一个虚拟机上？

PC 出现问题无法解决，无奈之下重装系统（ Clean Install), 装完后恢复数据有感。
同时使用 Chrome 和 Edge 的，登录账号同步数据，Chrome 几乎把所有数据原封不动的恢复到重装系统之前状态了（只有几个插件的数据丢了，其他数据都在），Edge 把很多数据给弄丢了，自定义搜素引擎没了、所有插件设置没了，书签位置也变了，浏览器自己的设置也没了，同步了个寂寞，感觉 Edge 在侮辱 “同步” 这两个字。
建议大家主力还是用 Chrome 吧，比 Edge 好太多了，最起码在稳定性上，不会有莫名其妙的 bug</span>

他写的也比较抽象
就是 OA 审批
ABC 三个角色.
C 先定义一些表格 Excel 什么的.
A 提交内容(表格,图片,文字)给 B 审核,B 同意后再提交给 C.....
中间可能还会涉及到一些界面.
1.注册登录模块.(小程序应该是直接关联微信号,这里可以省略)
2.权限等级设置.(感觉也可以过滤掉,我后台直接指定.节约成本)
3.C 角色设置表单样式.界面
4.A 角色提交界面.(表单详情)
5.与用户相关的表单列表界面(提交和处理的处理记录).
6.本单位人员列表.
7.个人资料界面
大概就分析出了这么几个界面.

我本身 android 开发的,后台也会一些这个需求比较简单.
没弄过小程序.不知道小程序多少合适.
感觉还能给我时间学.

很多东西都不明确也没有界面.说是对界面没有需求,只要功能出来就行.
对接端是 ZF..不知道有没有坑.</span>

我们需要对接 worldpay 做个订阅支付的功能，有些蛮奇怪的点：
发起订阅时不用指定扣款周期，如按月还是年扣款；
后续的周期扣款不由 worldpay 发起，由商家(我们)发起(首单时我们存储了一些用户的信用卡信息)；
我们也对接了 paypal 的订阅支付，没有上面两点的问题。
感觉 worldpay 这样不会很不安全吗？给商家的权利过大了？
是因为 worldpay 是采用国外信用卡体系的方式？

还有重量确实重了一点点，但也只有线上会才会临时拿起来。处于能拿起来，有重量的位置，不是 air 那种轻松拿走的感觉。

The Pixel 6A may have only been released last Thursday, but Google is wasting no time in bringing the latest beta version of Android 13 to its new midrange device. 9to5Google reports that Android 13’s latest beta, version 4.1, is now available for the Pixel 6A. The software was first released last Monday, when it was initially available for the Pixel 4 through 6 Pro.
Android 13 is shaping up to be a relatively minor update for Google’s mobile operating system. It builds on some of the design changes seen in last year’s Android 12 update with expanded support for theming app icons, and also adds support for the new Bluetooth LE Audio standard, as well as new privacy features.

Logitech G is working with Tencent Games to launch a dedicated cloud gaming handheld later this year. The new hardware will be designed for cloud gaming services, offering a dedicated device with controls instead of the typical cases you attach to phones. The cloud gaming handheld will support Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, and Logitech and Tencent are both working with Microsoft and Nvidia on the hardware.
Logitech and Tencent are simply teasing the device today, and there’s no mention of a release date, pricing, or even what the cloud gaming handheld looks like. Logitech will obviously be leaning on its experience building PC and console gaming accessories, while Tencent looks to be more of an operations partner.

Apple is dropping its mask mandates for corporate employees at “most locations,” according to an internal email from the COVID-19 response team, obtained by The Verge.
“Don’t hesitate to continue wearing a face mask if you feel more comfortable doing so,” the email reads. “Also, please respect every individual’s decision to wear a mask or not.”
The move comes amid a surge in the highly transmissible BA.5 variant of COVID-19. Earlier this week, the Bay Area transit system BART brought back its mask mandate.
Apple started requiring some employees to return to the office in April, but stopped short of implementing its full hybrid model, which would mandate three days of in-person work for all employees, every week.

No, you didn&#x27;t suddenly forget how to read: Roku, the streaming box and service company,  is worried about how much money its buttons are bringing in. Not because it suddenly started making clicky actuators for other companies to include in their products (what a pivot that would be), but because Roku’s really an advertising company in streamer’s clothing. And it absolutely has prime real estate to sell to streaming services: for a fee, it’ll plaster their logos onto buttons that customers will likely see every time they use a Roku. Even better, those buttons will only launch that service. 
Basically, Roku’s best ROI may be the Netflix-red and Disney-blue paint its suppliers buy.
Near the bottom of each Roku remote, you’ll see four...

When I use the Linux command line, whether I&#x27;m writing a new program on my desktop computer or managing a website on my web server, I often need to process text files. Linux provides powerful tools that I leverage to get my work done. I frequently use sed, an editor that can modify text according to a pattern.
sed stands for stream editor, and it edits text in a file and prints the results. One way to use sed is to identify several occurrences of one string in a file and replace them with a different string. You can use sed to process text files to a seemingly endless degree, but I&#x27;d like to share a few ways I use sed to help me manage files.

                              <span>学习为什么 Python 中的可观测性很重要，以及如何在你的软件开发生命周期中实现它。




你写的应用会执行很多代码，而且是以一种基本上看不到的方式执行。所以你是怎么知道：


代码是否在运行？

是不是在正常工作？

谁在使用它，如何使用？


可观测性是一种能力，可以通过查看数据来告诉你，你的代码在做什么。在这篇文章中，主要关注的问题是分布式系统中的服务器代码。并不是说客户端应用代码的可观测性不重要，只是说客户端往往不是用 Python 写的。也不是说可观测性对数据科学不重要，而是在数据科学领域的可观测性工具（大多是 Juptyter 和快速反馈）是不同的。

为什么可观测性很重要

所以，为什么可观测性重要呢？在软件开发生命周期（SDLC）中，可观测性是一个关键的部分。

交付一个应用不是结束，这只是一个新周期的开始。在这个周期中，第一个阶段是确认这个新版本运行正常。否则的话，很有可能需要回滚。哪些功能正常运行？哪些功能有细微的错误？你需要知道发生了什么，才能知道接下来要怎么做。这些东西有时候会以奇怪的方式不能正常运行。不管是天灾，还是底层基础设施的问题，或者应用进入了一种奇怪的状态，这些东西可能在任何时间以任何理由停止工作。

在标准 SDLC 之外，你需要知道一切都在运行中。如果没有，有办法知道是怎么不能运行的，这是非常关键的。

反馈

可观测性的第一部分是获得反馈。当代码给出它正在做什么的信息时，反馈可以在很多方面提供帮助。在模拟环境或测试环境中，反馈有助于发现问题，更重要的是，以更快的方式对它们进行分类。这可以改善在验证步骤中的工具和交流。

当进行金丝雀部署canary deployment或更改特性标志时，你需要知道是否要继续，还是等更长时间，或者回滚，反馈就显得很重要了。

监控

                              <span>AppFlowy 旨在成为 Notion 的开源替代品，为你提供更好的隐私保护。让我们了解一下它。


虽然项目管理/笔记工具 Notion 功能非常出色，但它并不是一个开源解决方案。此外，它没有 Linux 桌面客户端。

那么，对于 Linux 用户来说，更透明、更私密和可用的替代方案是什么？

这就是 AppFlowy 大放异彩的地方！

AppFlowy 使用 Rust 和 Flutter 构建，遵循极简原则，但提供了足够的调整空间。

AppFlowy 是隐私和用户体验的完美结合



AppFlowy 是相当新的。在它去年首次推出后，我们曾 报告 了它的发展状况。

这是一个开源项目，旨在克服 Notion 在安全和隐私方面的一些限制。它可以帮助你管理任务、添加待办事项列表、截止日期、跟踪事件、添加页面，以及为你的笔记/任务设置文本格式。

不仅仅是安全性。用户体验也很重要。而 AppFlowy 在这方面做得很好，甚至比 Notion 更好。

请注意，该项目仍处于 测试阶段。

目前，该项目的目标不是提供更好的设计和功能，而是数据隐私、原生体验和社区驱动。

Notion 与 AppFlowy，如何选择？

虽然它旨在作为取代 Notion 的开源解决方案，但它可能并不适合所有人。

因此，如果你要选择 AppFlowy 而不是 Notion，你将获得以下好处：

透明度

AppFlowy 是一个开源项目，因此你可以随时查看和修改代码。

需要注意的是，沙漠里突然下阵暴雨，那倒是不稀奇。但像这次这样，沿着阿曼阿联酋卡塔尔伊朗沙特也门下个遍，而且这么多天都有暴雨，这就很离谱了。正如我们上上期节目所说，这场暴雨，是印度洋赤道罗斯贝波异常发展，让原本应该

It’s officially August, which means we’re getting close to the fall hardware season, and two recent FCC filings from Amazon and Google could hint at a couple products the companies may — or may not — reveal.
Google’s product is pretty mysterious; the product is described only as a “Wireless Device.” It appears to be battery-powered — there’s no AC connection — though it can be powered over a 5V USB connection, and one diagram shows it connected to a laptop for testing. As 9to5Google observed, the filing could indicate that this is some kind of Nest device — some Nest cameras have used 3.65V rechargeable batteries, for example.
Google has already said the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, and Pixel Watch will arrive this fall, so whatever this...

For about $50,000 (30 Ethereum), CryptoPunk holders can get a handcrafted pendant modeled after their NFT (non-fungible token) from Tiffany &amp; Co. — and no, this is not a joke (via Decrypt). The pendant, which will feature “at least” 30 diamonds or gemstones, will hang on an 18K gold chain with five pave diamonds on the clasp.
The offer is exclusive only to people who own a CryptoPunk, aka the odd pixelated avatars you keep seeing on Twitter (no, not those ones, the other ones). But don’t let the overly simplistic art fool you — the average cost of these things is about $200,000, even after several months of declining sales activity for the market overall. There are only 10,000 CryptoPunk designs, and now you can get your very own...

When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. 
Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. 
Below, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or any of the products — which is...

Amazon&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions ballooned big time last year despite the company&#x27;s efforts to sell itself as a leader in climate action. Its carbon dioxide emissions grew an eye-popping 18 percent in 2021 compared to 2020, according to its latest sustainability report. 
Amazon generated 71.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent last year, about as much pollution as 180 gas-fired power plants might pump out annually. This is the second year in a row that Amazon&#x27;s climate pollution has grown by double digits since it made a splashy climate pledge and started reporting its emissions publicly in 2019.

Beginning this season, Amazon Prime Video will be the exclusive home for the NFL&#x27;s Thursday Night Football.

Curry debuted as a New York City street artist known as Swoon right around the turn of the last century, her hand-worked portraits making striking, albeit illegal, statements on old walls.

                              <span>Linus 在 Macbook 上发布了 Linux 内核 5.19

今天，Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 5.19，在对新硬件方面添加了对龙芯 CPU 和 Zen 4 CPU 的支持，支持 Zstd 压缩固件，并进一步改进了性能。有趣的是，Linux 表示，这次 5.19 的发布工作是在他的苹果 MacBook 笔记本上完成的，这台笔记本运行了 Asahi Linux 为苹果 M1 Macbook 打造的 Linux 系统。Linus 说，“这是我个人期待了很久的事情，而现在终于变成了现实。”在很早之前他曾在 PPC970 设备上为 PowerPC 进行过开发，这是他第三次使用苹果硬件用于 Linux 开发。他说，“但现阶段我并没有将 MacBook Air 用于任何真实工作，我只是将其用于版本测试、启动以及现在的版本发布。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：果然 Linus 对 Asahi Linux 的工作非常满意，我寻思我也是不是把我的 M1 Macbook 换成 Asahi Linux。




Linux 内核不过 520

被称为 Linux 5.20 的开发中的内核很可能会被称为 Linux 6.0。根据 Linus Torvalds 对现代版本的划分，Linux 又到了采用下一个主要版本号的时候。他对主要版本的提升通常会在小版本更新到 19 或 20 时进行。Linux 3.19 之后是 Linux 4.0，Linux 4.20 之后是 Linux 5.0。在周日的 Linux 5.19 公告中，Linus 表示“我可能会叫它 6.0，因为我开始担心再次被大数字所迷惑”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linux 内核的大版本号其实没什么特别的，就是一个进位而已，你就当成内核版本号采用的是 20 进制好了。有时候可能还忘记进位了。




Python 开发者讨论从邮件列表转移到论坛

Python 项目在 2018 年开始实验使用论坛交流，作为实验的一部分，Python 核心开发者使用的邮件列表 python-committers 切换到了 Discourse 论坛。今天该邮件列表仍然存在，但主要作为发布公告使用，大部分讨论都是在论坛上进行的。一位开发者称，他不怎么访问 Discourse 而错过了有兴趣的新 PEP 讨论，希望新 PEP 能发布在 python-dev 邮件列表上。这个提议引发了讨论。最终，Python 语言指导委员会表示要将讨论的媒介切换到 Discourse 论坛，Python 的邮件列表可能要全面转向论坛了。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：虽然确实很多老程序员都习惯了邮件列表，但是应该与时俱进，采用更丰富、更现代的交流方式。而同时保留老的交流方式，直到没什么人继续使用它，或因为缺乏重要功能而被废弃。</span>

                              <span>fmt 命令是一个简单的文本格式化程序。我将在这里展示如何使用它来格式化文本和邮件回复。


当我为项目编写文档时，我经常以纯文本的形式编写自述文件和安装说明。我不需要使用 HTML 或者 Markdown 之类的标记语言来描述项目的功能或如何编译它。但是维护这样的文档可能会很痛苦。如果我需要更新我的 Readme 文件中的一个句子的中间位置，我需要重新格式化文本，以避免在我的其它文本中间出现一个很长或很短的行，而其它的行的格式是整整齐齐的 75 列。一些编辑器包含可以自动重新格式化文本以填充段落的功能，但并非所有的编辑器都这样做。这就是 Linux fmt 命令的用武之地。

使用 Linux fmt 命令格式化文本

fmt 命令是一个简单的文本格式化程序；它收集单词并填充段落，但不应用任何其它文本样式，例如斜体或粗体。这一切都是纯文本。使用 fmt 命令，你可以快速调整文本，使其更易于阅读。让我们从这个熟悉的示例文本开始:

$ cat trek.txt 
Space: the final
frontier. These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise. Its
continuing mission: to explore
strange new worlds. To
seek out new life and new
civilizations. To boldly go
where no one has gone before!


在这个实例文件中，每行都有不同的长度，并且它们以一种奇怪的方式换行。如果你对纯文本文件进行大量更改，你可以会遇到类似的奇怪的换行。要重新格式化此文本，你可以使用 fmt 命令将段落的行填充为统一长度：

$ fmt trek.txt 
Space:…</span>

                              <span>从 .deb 文件安装应用 非常简单。双击它，它会在软件中心中打开，然后从那里安装它。

但是如何在 Ubuntu 或 Debian 中卸载 deb 包呢？如何删除一段时间前安装的软件包呢。

虽然这有几个如果和但是，但删除 .deb 文件的最简单和最可靠的方法是使用 apt remove 命令。

sudo apt remove program_name


如你所见，你需要在这里知道确切的包名称。这可能并不总是显而易见的。例如，如果你在 Ubuntu 上安装 Google Chrome，则该程序在命令行中称为 “google-chrome-stable”。你已经知道了吗？我猜你不知道。

在本教程中，我将详细介绍如何找到确切的包名称，然后使用它来删除应用。我还将讨论使用图形方法删除 deb 包。

从 Ubuntu 中删除通过 .deb 文件安装的软件包

在我向你展示如何从命令行删除 deb 包之前，让我们在软件中心应用中快速查看它。

方法 1：检查应用是否可以从软件中心移除

Ubuntu 有软件中心 GUI 应用，允许搜索、安装和删除应用。

搜索时，软件中心可能不会显示已安装的应用。



但是，如果向下滚动，你仍可能在“已安装”部分下找到它。外部应用通常不带徽标显示。



如果找到它，你可以通过单击“垃圾桶”图标或“删除”按钮来删除该应用。



一句话：检查是否可以从软件中心删除应用。

方法 2：使用 apt 命令删除应用

我假设你不知道该应用命令的确切名称。你可能不知道 Google Chrome 安装为 google-chrome-stable 而 Edge 安装为 microsoft-edge-stable，这很正常。

如果你知道前几个字母，那么 tab 补全可能会有所帮助。否则，你可以 使用 apt 命令列出已安装的应用 并使用 grep 搜索应用程序名称：

apt list --installed | grep -i possible_package_name


例如，你可以智能地猜测 Google Chrome 包的名称中应该包含 chrome。你可以这样搜索：

apt list --installed | grep -i chrome


在某些情况下，你可能会得到多个结果。



如果你不确定这些软件包的作用，你可以随时通过以下方式获取它们的详细信息：

apt info exact_package_name


获得确切的软件包名称后，你可以使用 apt remove 命令将其删除。

sudo apt remove exact_package_name


你还可以使用 apt-get remove 或 dpkg uninstall 命令来删除。



方法 3：使用 Synaptic 包管理器删除 deb 应用

另一种方法是使用 Synaptic 包管理器。在 GNOME 以“软件中心”的形式创建其图形包管理器之前，Synaptic 是 Ubuntu 和许多其他发行版中的默认 GUI 包管理器。

它仍然是 Xfce 桌面环境 上的推荐工具。

首先安装它：

sudo apt install synaptic


打开 Synaptic 并搜索包名称。查找标记为绿色的已安装软件包。右键单击它们，然后单击“标记为删除”。之后点击应用。



对你有帮助吗？

我非常乐意使用 apt 命令删除从 .deb 文件中安装的软件包。但我可以理解，并不是每个人都喜欢使用命令行。

在删除从外部 .deb 文件安装的应用时，我发现软件中心中找不到它。软件中心还可以做的更好一些。

我希望你现在对删除 deb 包有更好的了解。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。

                              <span>Linux Mint 终于发布了基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的 “Vanessa”，并带来了很多有用的改进。




Linux Mint 是 最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。它使用 Ubuntu 作为其基础，特别是它基于 长期支持 的 Ubuntu 版本，以获得长达 5 年的软件支持。

现在，我们有一个新的版本升级，即 Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa”，它基于 4 月份最新发布的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 版本。因此，用户可以预期它的安全更新可以支持到 2027 年。

让我们来看看这个版本的亮点。

Linux Mint 21 Vanessa 的新亮点



它采用了稳定的、改进的 Linux 5.15 LTS 内核，Linux Mint 21 带来了一系列新的增加、变化和完善。

现有用户的升级工具



现有的 Mint 20.3 用户可以使用新的基于 GUI 的升级工具轻松更新他们的系统。

用户会看到一个需要安装或升级的新软件包的列表，这也包括了对你可能手动添加的第三方 PPA 库的检查。

新的蓝牙管理器



Blueman 现在取代了图形界面的 GNOME 蓝牙管理器 Blueberry。

之所以这样做，主要是因为 Blueman 提供了更多的功能和连接选项，以及对多种桌面环境的更好支持。此外，Blueman 的用户界面与 Linux Mint 完美地融合在一起。

Blueman 包括一些高级选项，可能大多数用户用不到，但它是一个好工具。

新的进程监控托盘图标



不管是对于资深用户还是初级用户来说，一个非常有用的功能是引入了一个新的托盘图标，可以监控进程！

这个托盘图标将通知用户是否有任何自动化进程（如更新和系统快照）在后台运行。

当系统变得缓慢时，Mint 用户将很容易知道该去哪里找到问题！

增强的缩略图支持



以前，一些文件类型没有任何缩略图显示，这样的用户体验不是很好。

为了解决这个问题，这个版本引入了一个新的项目 xapp-thumbnails，并为包括 AppImage、ePub、MP3、RAW 图片和 WebP 在内的文件类型带来了缩略图支持。

XApp 的改进

以前的 Timeshift 备份工具现在成为了一个 XApp，并由 Mint 团队正式维护。此外，在 rsync 模式下，如果快照导致磁盘上的可用空间少于 1GB，则会计算出下一次快照所需的空间并跳过下一次快照。

Xviewer、Warpinator、Thingy 和 WebApp 管理器也有了其他改进。

Cinnamon 5.4.2

Linux Mint 的旗舰桌面环境 Cinnamon 得到了良好的内部升级。

默认的窗口管理器 Muffin 现在重新基于较新的 Mutter 3.36 代码库开发。

窗口 UI 也有一些细微的改进，包括主题和动画。



其他增加的功能和改进

其他一些变化包括：


改进了对 AppImage 的支持，这与 Ubuntu 22.04 不同

目录中出现了一组新的漂亮的壁纸


你可以在我们专门的 Linux Mint 21 功能 文章中探索更多关于它的新亮点。

获取 Linux Mint 21

如果你正在使用 Mint 20.3，你应该能在几天内升级到 Mint 21。图形化的更新过程应该会在几天后出现。

你可以选择从 Linux Mint 的下载页面下载 ISO，进行全新安装。


获取 Linux Mint 21


如果你的网络速度慢或不稳定，你也可以 用这个种子链接。

享受新鲜的 Mint 吧 🙂

主力的办公机型都是 macos ，有 mini 和 14pro ， 这台就是为了在家简单办公+Dota2 ，所以考虑是不是可以 M1 Pro Studio ？
1 个月前搞了一个巨大的 ASUS 的 3090 台式机，实在是太占地儿了，而且尝试了很久还是不爱玩那些 3A 大作，割肉出掉了，还是想搞个桌面的小巧点的好看点的 ITX ？ 我猜搞个 3080 或者 3070 之类的散热应该问题不大吧？ 毕竟我只想打个 dota2.
所以我现在初步考虑是：
1. M1 Pro Studio or M1 Max Studio 
2. Intel 的 NUC ？ 可是好像 12 代不是很好买。 好像还有个巨蛇峡谷？
3. 微星好像也出了类似 NUC 的小主机，不知道用起来怎么样。 
好看点的自己攒一个我也 OK 的，价格倒是无所谓。 安静点的 好看点就好。

Go 微服务开发框架DMicro的设计思路
DMicro源码地址:
GitHub: https://github.com/osgochina/dmicro
Gitee: https://gitee.com/osgochina/dmicro
背景
DMicro诞生的背景，是因为我写了 10 来年的 PHP ，想在公司内部推广Go,公司内部的组件及 rpc 协议都是基于swoole定制化开发的。调研了市面上的各种框架，包括beego,goframe,gin,go-micro,go-zero,erpc等等，可能是我当时技术能力有限，并不能让这些框架很好的适配我们的业务。
我们业务开发有几个痛点，在当时golang的生态中无法找到一整套解决方案。
微服务应用和单体应用同时开发。
高性能，高可用的网络通讯。
需要自定义应用层的协议(重点)。
需要灵活的插件扩展机制，方便适配现有系统(重点)。
服务端与客户端的概念模糊，互相都能使用相同的 api 调用对方。
支持 Push 消息。
连接 /会话管理。
高效率的开发，支持通过 proto 生成代码。
支持多种网络协议，tcp,websocket,quic,unixsocket.
兼容 http 协议。
能够更快速的定位问题。
更便捷的增加新特性。
在对常用的开源框架做了简单的调研以后，发现并没有一款合适的框架能满足我的所有需求。在认真思考过后，发现erpc和goframe两个框架的结合体能满足我的需求，于是就诞生了自研DMicro.
概述
DMicro中的drpc组件的思想是参考erpc实现，甚至可以说是它的继承者。
drpc组件是DMicro框架的一部分，为了适配DMicro框架，在erpc的基础上做了深入的扩展开发。
整个DMicro大量使用goframe中的组件，如果业务使用goframe框架，可以无缝接入…</span>

在用 hikvision 的监控设备, 录制视频的设置要么只能设置实时录制, 要么只能设置移动监测.
**我想要的效果是, 在 24 小时实时录制的基础上, 还能标记哪些时间段是有人经过(有事件发生)的, 看回放的时候可以跳着看(事件)也可以完整看.
好像海康的不支持这么操作, 要么就 24 小时录制, 要么就只能移动监测.
之所以有这样的需求, 是因为我开了移动监测录像, 在看回放的时候发现有半个小时是有人在那个区域作业但是海康没保存下来. 我认为这个移动监测功能并不是百分百靠谱的.</span>

如果她不走，我们面临的现实是：
 - 我两年前去她所在的城市买了房子，去年年底交房，马上装修完我们就不用租房了；
 - 我收养了很多很多猫，她也喜欢猫；
 - 我们即将结婚，家人见过很多次，相处融洽；
 - 她两年没上班了，学很多东西都没成，经济上我独立支撑，甚至失业半年都没花过她家一分钱，我没有给过她压力；
 - 今年找工作找的很艰难，但还是找到了；

她的决定是：
 - 去哪都行，反正就是要走，马上走，再不走国门就关紧了，整个人是一种惊恐逃难的状态；
 - 自身能力不足，无一技之长，目前打算去新加坡做劳工，中介费都交了；
 - 她家人不支持，她选择断绝了和父母的关系；
 - 拒绝了过三年准备妥当再走的方案
 - 她拒绝了我的所有劝解和妥协，宁肯信中介和电报群里的“精神领袖”

我尝试劝说的努力：
 - 先从动机分析，大部分人出国是为了更好的生活，而她出去基本是众叛亲离万劫不复
 - 梳理了一遍历史，从延安一直讲到最近，总之就是她所看到的所谓真理实际是一遍遍的在发生，并不是突然发生了什么灾难，就算真的发生了灾难，回归大家庭抱团取暖也能活下去，就算要走，等几年准备好了走，天不会马上塌下来
 - 列了个三年计划，和详细设计文档一样细，核心是自我提升并获得家庭的支持，然后读书也好工作也好，名正言顺
 - 提出了回老家（靠海有房），去西北，去人少的城市，去林场山区隐居，等很多可以逃避恐惧的方案
 - 列出了她出国劳务的风险，以及诸多被骗的案例，包括去了新加坡也是国人老板，外籍劳工法律保障可能还不如富士康
 - 找了专业的治疗应激反应的心理咨询师

所有方法没有用，经过了三个月的努力，今天最终还是放弃了，每一个人有每一个人的命运，现在负债快 20 万了，还得借一笔钱给她出国，我认为这就是仁至义尽的极限了。

今天看到她电报里的聊天记录，她转账付费 1340 元咨询出国方案，即使她说了她的现实情况，对方还是一直在劝她走，其中有一句是“追求自由的人都是自私的”，我感觉润学已经发展成邪教了，敛财并且把人害的家破人亡。</span>

老妈来了, 给我们做早饭午饭晚饭, 我对象湖北人, 我是山东人, 定居青岛.
她吃不惯我妈做的菜, 不喜欢吃饺子面条海鲜等. 但我妈拿手的就是饺子面条, 每天炒的菜也不符合我对象口味.
炖的排骨不吃, 炖的羊汤也不喜欢吃, 炖的鸡也不吃. 我对象在青岛生活了八九年, 依然吃不惯这里的菜. 屈指可数的喜欢我妈做的菜有: 西红柿鸡蛋汤 /蒸排骨(丈母娘来教的)/蒸鸡蛋羹 /炸藕盒 /青椒炒牛肉 /土豆丝, 这些菜感觉要吃腻了.
为了不让婆媳关系变差, 于是想让我妈学两道简单的湖北菜, 主要是炒菜为主. 王刚老师和小高姐的就先不推荐哈, 已经知道这俩了.</span>

核心诉求：每周的饮食有没有符合《中国居民平衡膳食宝塔》的要求，差多少。估计值即可，不用很精确。
记录的时候可以选择大类，不用录入具体的菜。比如设定一整份蔬菜是 300g ，那么用户可以选择输入 1/4 分蔬菜。
油和盐可能需要估算下，比如普通菜的油和盐是固定的 /油炸食品按照具体大类设定不同值。</span>

要在虚拟机里部署服务-原神的云崽 bot ，用 redis 和 nodejs 。大概占用 10g 左右的文件。
r2s 里的 dockerman 用不来，本可以说用 docker 里放个服务的，但是无奈自己太菜，不会弄。

一直觉得微信实际占用空间，远远大于图标中展示的效果，起到了误导的效果。
于是闲的无聊，截屏测量了一下
图中的显示为 105px/950px&#x3D;11%
实际微信占用空间为 28.7GB/120GB&#x3D;24%
其中手机肯定低于 120GB 的总容量，且往大了估计，那么至少瞒报了 120%的储存占用

obj1 和 obj2 等等对象，都是历史遗留，对象里面属性名都是固定死的。对象属性名不同但是属性的用法都是一样的。
目前想封装一个 myNewModule 模块（先认为是函数，不一定是函数）能处理它们，但是能不能不用 options 参数来告知属性名，想改为一种在未来 debug 时更加容易理解的方式来告知 /注册。
const obj1 &#x3D; {
  registerLabel: &#x27;张三&#x27;,
  registerAge: 56,

住了 3 年多了，退房后自己特意打扫了一遍，地面上基本清洁好了，就厨房和卫生间阳台没有用抹布去擦，自己也打
算好了，付点清洁费用。
房东直接让我付 300 清洁费，整个一房一厅就 25 平米。还说让 2 个阿姨来看，只有一个肯做，300 都嫌少。
然后我打开了美团，看了下别人 70 平米的房间，4 小时清洁才 256 元。我这边就 25 平米清洁收我 300 ，后面好说歹说最后定了 200. qtm
接着说客厅墙上有挂钩（一共 13 个透明挂钩），说客厅的墙面需要重新刷漆，要 600 块。。真抢钱啊。后面理论了下，说我住进去的时
候前租客就在墙面留下很多双面胶布之内（房东自己也知道），后面就让我缴 300 。。。
哎。虽然不想给，但是押金在他手上啊，还是 2 个月的押金。</span>

There are several reasons why good commits are important. First, commits are used to track changes to a project. This is especially important when working on a team, as it allows everyone to see what changes have been made and who made them. Good commits should be clear and concise so that they are easy to understand. Second, commits should be atomic, meaning that each commit should only contain one change. This makes it easier to revert changes if necessary. Finally, good commits should be made regularly so that the project history is easy to follow.
Write clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages. This means that your commit message should be able to stand on its own and explain what changes were made in the commit. A good commit message shoul…</span>

                              <span>This post is about clicking on an element without JavaScript.
Let&#x27;s say that you have a button on which you want to click and perform a simple action like displaying some hidden content.
const btn &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;)
btn.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // display my hidden content...
})

What if I tell you that you could do it with CSS ?!
While surfing the net, you surely clicked before on a hash-link, a link that redirects to a particular section in a page, just like the above Intro heading !
target on the page.
target in this case is reached by a link with a hash # :
Intro

This is why we call it a hash-link.
CSS has a :target pseudo-class, that can be used to select a target and style it !
display property ? 😉
Reveal the code !


    
This block of code is displayed after you click on the link
Hide the code !


#the-code {
    display: none;
}

#the-code:target {
    display: block;
}

So how does this work ?!
We have a hash-link :



Reveal the code !

We have a div with an ID matching the hash-link :



...
Hide the code !

When this one is clicked, the target is changed and the block of code goes back to it&#x27;s original state, hidden, since this hash-link doesn&#x27;t match it&#x27;s ID.
Nota bene : a demo is available on the original post.
Hope you&#x27;ll find it useful.

                              <span>Introduction


In the Go programming language with the version of 1.18 or later there is a new feature called Generics. Generics are a feature that has been featured in many programming languages like Java. Generics are a feature to define a type or data type as a parameter in a function or a struct.
The generics mechanism can be applied in a function. To use a generics feature, the any keyword can be used to define all data types that can be used as a parameter in a function or a struct. The other keyword that can be used is comparable which means the data type that implements comparable like int and float64.
This is an example of generics usage in a function. Before the generics are used, two functions are created called compareInt and compareFloat to compare two numbers for different da…</span>

There are few things harder than inter-department cooperation. That’s why we have terms like DevOps, DevSecOps, DesignOps…the list goes on. All of these operations-focused concepts aim to bring two separate parts of an organization together. This is tough but becomes even harder when one team has to be the one that slows things down. For some businesses, this is legal. For others, it’s security.
So how do you keep development moving, while also ensuring that security checks the necessary boxes? You bring the people together. Instead of treating security and development as separate goals, you make sure everyone is working toward the same one—with as l…</span>

We&#x27;ll be making a Hapi Js server from scratch using Node Js.
In order to follow this tutorial you will need to following have Node installed - ideally at the LTS (long term support) version.
Run the following command on your terminal to check if you have node installed:
node --version

In this tutorial, I will be using Visual Studio Code as the text editor and Postman for the HTTP requests, but feel free to use whichever tools you want.
Let&#x27;s start by making running the following commands:
mkdir hapi-tutorial

Most developers hate doing things that could be automated.
As emphasized in this tweet, we often have to accept that we cannot do it. Fortunately, in the case of code reviews, a lot of things can indeed be automated. As my previous CTO told me once
Life is too short to review spaces!
Between the fingers of the developers and the eyes of the reviewers there are two main steps where this automated review process can be done:
  as pre-commit hooks
  as CI jobs
In this article, we’ll focus on the pre-commit step. We’ll see how to install and setup pre-commit hooks and we’ll list the top 8 hooks we use at GitGuardian
From the git book, git hooks are a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur.

                              <span>When you listen about rootkit and if you are a linux user first thing that comes to your mind will be this has some thing to do with root user. And, you are not wrong but it&#x27;s a part of it. Let&#x27;s define it formally.
Rootkit is a program that can hide itself as well as other running processes, files, network connections from the host where it is running.
The main goal is to run incognito meaning running in the background for as long as it is possible.
It aims to hide the traces of intruder by manipulating processes, open files, network activity, changing access rights/permission of different files and directory.
One of the main goal of rootkit is to make sure that intruder have full remote access to the victim&#x27;s computer all the time. For e.g: rootkit may establish a backdoor using ssh tunneling.
It also enables attacker to wiretapping and intercepting various system components may be sending data to a particular end point or installing a keylogger.
The biggest challenge that also differentiate rootkit from other types of malware is the fact that rootkit need to be installed with root privileges in the first place.
User-mode rootkit: A user-mode rootkit covertly replaces common UNIX binaries or libraries with infected versions to hide its existence and to gain root privileges if needed.


Kernel-mode rootkit: A kernel-mode rootkit operates on the system level and modifies or replaces the kernel which may have been affected in the boot process.

The content there is simple, straightforward, and useful in many different scenarios. Few years ago, I thought that video tutorials are the only way to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and concepts but the reality is that it is only one of the few approaches you can take to both teach and learn about programming.

当口罩遮掩了情绪，当流调成了国人日常最真实的画像，当内心的平静取决于居家食物的储存量，远方让渡给了附近，未来模糊为了当下，我们如何在原子化的生存状态里，重新建立起与他人的连接？
是起于对一轮热播剧集的热议，是源自对一段电影台词的共鸣，或是深受到一个虚构故事的温暖，我们经由共同的关注、共通的情感，摆脱对彼此的割裂，重新找回旧时的默契。
所以，我相信，好的「作品」能够化为一种广泛的媒介，跨越时间之差、地域之隔，在不确定的世界里，引导我们重新拥抱当代生活。行至年中，回看年终，以下是我的 2021 年度作品推荐。
📖 最佳书籍
也许你该找个人聊聊

作者：洛莉·戈特利布
出版社：果麦文化 / 上海文化出版社
出版年：2021-7
页数：460
推荐指数：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

没有空泛无物的理论说教，也不同于自我中心的人物传记，这是一位心理治疗师的回忆录，讲述的是发生在诊室中的动人故事。在书中，我们会看到四个来访者，他们性格秉性不同，背景身份迥异，却因遭受各自人生困境，都来寻求心理治疗。同时，书中还有第五个寻求帮助的人，那就是心理治疗师自己。她是一个单身的职场妈妈，四十多岁时遭遇失恋，几乎崩溃。有朋友对她说，「或许你该找个人聊聊」，于是，她也给自己找了一位心理治疗师，切换到了来访者的位置，给自己的内心举起一面映照的镜子。
作者洛莉·戈特利布大学毕业后，在全美广播公司从事剧集创作工作，一次为收集素材、跟随急诊医生到郡立医院的探访，令她颇受震撼——「亲身经历的事情，使杜撰出来的故事显得那样单薄」。洛莉自此萌生攻读斯坦福医学…</span>

                              <span>🌟 Part 1 不想错过精彩内容

2022 年 2 月 7 日，我由于一些契机接触到了少数派。1 个月里，我阅读了很多大家写的文章，当时的感觉就是：哇，少数派的作者写的东西太真诚了，每一篇文章的背后都是一段实实在在的亲身实践。对于我而言，虽然自己也会记笔记，但是它们总是零零散散，后面回顾的效果也不是特别好。最后干脆也不经常整理和看笔记了。
然而我又不想错过少数派写的诸如《Power +》等文章的精华，因此甚是苦恼。假如有一个机器，能够帮助我轻松地记录「小灵感 / 知识碎片 / 心得体会」，并且还能够帮助我更好地进行回顾就好了。当然，也不是说就要一字不落的把全文都背下来，没必要。所以我希望它可以让我在打开手机的时候，能够把我之前学习的知识链条清晰地展示出来。

注：文中的链接会在文末一并再次放出，开启深色模式可以获得最佳阅读体验

🌟 Part 2 与 Flomo 相识

在想法诞生的第二天，我就在少数派探索到了 Flomo。在这之前，我几乎从来没有系统化地整理过知识（高考笔记除外），也没有做过任何对外的内容输出。
当时就想，这白白绿绿的 App 看着还挺轻盈，有一种树林小草在生长的感觉。打开后瞬间被它极简的界面吸引住了 —— 每当你需要写一张小卡片的时候，你只需要像发微博一样，点击下方的加号即可撰写内容。
简单尝试之后，发现 App 的配色、间距都非常的统一，每一条内容就是一张精美的小卡片。用 Flomo 写作有一种极强的沉浸感。于是我开始用它来记录自己每一个时刻迸发的想法，以及摘录和批注在少数派读到的受启发的内容（如图）；接着对它进行批注，来记录思考后的链接卡片。整个使用过程中没有任何规则和冗长的教学来约束我「应该如何去用一款笔记 App」，仿佛在写朋友圈，简单而便捷。

                              <span>家庭治疗兴起于二十世纪中期，属于团体治疗（group therpay）的一部分。他们一致反对主流的声音，即认为心理症状只来自于个体本身，提出心理问题其实是来自个体与他人相处方式受到干扰所带来的副产品。
家庭治疗认为，心理症状是个体所处的家庭由于功能失调所带来的副产品。
家庭治疗师从哲学和科学当中借鉴了一个理论：系统方法（system approach），即整体大于部分之和。换句话说，其实是从个人治疗的思想中切换到以家庭为单位（faimly-unit）治疗思想。治疗师关注的是整个家庭状况，而不是单独针对个人，将责任归咎于家庭中的某个人，或者指责某个人。所以，家庭治疗中，最基本的东西。过程中，家庭成员与治疗师一起努力，改善成员之间的互动，从而加强每个成员的心理健康。
系统理论
系统方法的核心是循环因果关系（Circular causality）比线性因果关系（Linear causality）更能解释心理问题。

线性因果关系：A 影响 B；但 B 不影响 A。意思是，父母对待孩子的方式影响孩子的后续行为，但孩子的后续行为并不会反过来影响父母。
循环因果关系：A 与 B 互相影响。意思是，父母对待孩的方式影响孩子的后续行为，而此种后续行为也同样影响着父母。

家庭中，普遍存在的问题是不健康的沟通模式。在家庭治疗的早期，很多理论家将它与病理结果结合在一起，诞生了最为著名和有趣的两个例子。第一个例子是「精神分裂症母亲」（Fromm-Reichamnn, 1948）。这个理论认为，专制且冷酷的母亲与无能、弱势的父亲结合在一起，会导致孩子精神分裂。第二个理论是双重束缚理论（Bateson, Jackson, Haley, &amp; Weakland, 1956)。这个理论认为，父母一直给孩子不可避免的混合命令，也会导致精神分裂的症状。当然，这两个理论如今都没有被广泛接受，而且关于精神分裂症背…</span>

IPv6 is a good thing for the Internet in general, but I find it unnecessarily complex for use in most home and small- to medium-size businesses. Like many others, I continue to use private IPv4 address ranges for my own internal networks and those for which I have some level of responsibility. My ISP only provides IPv4 addresses anyway, so it makes no sense to use IPv6 internally when all external packets are IPv4. Besides, IPv4 is much simpler, and one of my Linux Philosophy tenets is &quot;Find the Simplicity.&quot;
As a result, I disabled IPv6 on all my hosts. It seemed easy—at first. Here is how I did it.

Everyone does program management. Some just do it poorly.
I&#x27;ve used that line for a laugh at the beginning of talks, but it&#x27;s true. Program management is, at its core, the act of coordinating the interfaces between teams to produce something of value. In open source projects, the &quot;something of value&quot; is generally the software that the community produces. Most open source communities create software, and almost none of them have a formal program manager. So why have a program manager?
The difference lies in managing the software development with intent instead of by accident. The smaller the community, the easier it is to self-coordinate. The need for in…</span>

Nichelle Nichols, who was best known for her groundbreaking role as Nyota Uhura in the original Star Trek series, died at age 89. Her son, Kyle Johnson, informed her fans in a post on Nichols’ Instagram account.
“Last night, my mother, Nichelle Nichols, succumbed to natural causes and passed away,” Johnson writes. “Her light however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain for us and future generations to enjoy, learn from, and draw inspiration.”

Considering how intertwined music discovery is with TikTok, it wouldn’t be all that surprising if the company launched a music streaming app of its own. Well, patent filings uncovered by Insider suggest TikTok’s working on just that.
TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, filed a trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for “TikTok Music” in May. According to the filing, the service would let users purchase, play, share, and download music. It would also allow users to create, share, and recommend playlists, comment on music, as well as livestream audio and video. ByteDance already filed for a “TikTok Music” trademark in Australia last November.
ByteDance already has experience with music streaming. In 2020, ByteDance...

Just days after the Pixel 6A’s launch, Google’s rolling out an update to fix an issue preventing users from unlocking the bootloader and performing mods, according to a report from Android Police. The change is bundled within the Pixel 6A’s first update, which Google just started releasing last week.
In short, a bootloader is a piece of software that loads the operating system (OS) on a device when it turns on. Gaining access to the bootloader on Android can give you full control over your OS in a process known as rooting. It also allows you to install modded versions of Android, called ROMs. While some phone-makers and carriers don’t let you unlock your device’s bootloader, Google does things differently. It lets you dive right in on...

Tomb Raider’s movie rights are up for grabs. According to a report from TheWrap, the Amazon-owned MGM waited too long to create a sequel to its 2018 Tomb Raider film, freeing up the rights for the next Hollywood studio that wants to take a stab at creating an adaption of the long-running video game franchise.
Several studios are currently engaged in a bidding war to snap up the Tomb Raider rights, TheWrap reports. And since the license come with no obligation to retain the same cast and crew, the next Tomb Raider film could be a total reboot that passes the Lara Croft baton to yet another actress.
The 2018 Tomb Raider stars Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, and was met with mixed reviews that criticized its weak portrayal of the series’...

                              <span>There’s a lot to be said for an app with one singular function, and that’s what makes the Tab app so magical. Unlike other bill splitting apps like Splitwise, which lets you split and track any type of expense, the Tab app exists to only split meal bills among a group of people. That’s it — that’s all it does. 
I was first introduced to the app by my friends when I lived in New York City. After many dinners and debates over who ordered an extra side of fries, who got three beers instead of two, and who just had an hors d’oeuvre in place of an entree, we were fed up with doing basic math so the five or six people at the table could each pay their fair share. Thus, we transitioned to the Tab app. Its appeal came from the ease of signing up...

Apple has made macOS very good at handling drag and drops. For example, I often pull a picture right out of the Photos app or Safari and drop it into iMessage or Slack. One thing that’s always slowed me down, though, is moving around more traditional files, like PDFs or other documents.
But then I learned that quite a few apps, including many of the built-in ones, have a quick shortcut to get at the file you’re viewing. Using this shortcut (which is officially called the proxy icon), you can easily do things like upload a PDF you have open in Preview to Google Drive without having to go looking for the file in Finder.

2022 年 3 月辞职，没多久上海爆发疫情，蜗居在家准备面试。在经历 1 个月的闭关和 40+ 场 Android 面试后，拿到一些 offer。
总体上说，有如下几种面试题型：
基础知识
算法题
项目经历
场景题
场景题，即“就业务场景给出解决方案”，考察运用知识解决问题的能力。这类题取决于临场应变、长期积累、运气。
项目经历题取决于对工作内容的总结提炼、拔高升华、运气：
争取到什么样的资源
安排了怎么样的分工
搭建了什么样的架构
运用了什么模式
做了什么样的取舍
采用了什么策略
做了什么样的优化
解决了什么问题
力争把默默无闻的“拧螺丝”说成惊天动地的“造火箭”。（这是一门技术活）
但也不可避免地会发生“有些人觉得这是高大上的火箭，有些人觉得不过是矮小下的零件”。面试就好比相亲，甲之蜜糖乙之砒霜是常有的事。除非你优秀到解决了某个业界的难题。
算法题取决于刷题，运气，相较于前两类题，算法题可“突击”的成分就更多了。只要刷题足够多，胜算就足够大。大量刷，反复刷。
基础知识题是所有题型中最能“突击”的，它取决于对“考纲”的整理复习、归纳总结、背诵、运气。Android 的知识体系是庞杂的，对于有限的个人精力来说，考纲是无穷大的。
这不是一篇面经，把面试题公布是不讲武德的。但可以分享整个复习稿，它是我按照自己划定的考纲整理出的全部答案，由于篇幅太长，决定把全部内容分成两篇分享给大家，这一篇的内容是 Android 和 Java &amp; Kotlin。（必有遗漏，欢迎补充~）
整个复习稿分为如下几大部分：
Android
Java &amp; Kotlin
设计模式 &amp; 架构
多线程
网络
OkHttp &amp; Retrofit
Glide
Android
绘制流程
画多大？（测量measure）
画在哪？（定位layout）
画什么？（绘制draw）

                              <span>前言
使用组件化多模块开发的同学都有经验，当我们修改底层模块(比如util模块)时，所有依赖于这个模块的上层模块都需要重新编译，Kotlin的增量编译在这种情况往往是不生效的
在 Kotlin 1.7.0 中，Kotlin编译器对于跨模块增量编译也做了支持，并且与Gradle构建缓存兼容，对编译避免的支持也得到了改进。这些改进减少了模块和文件重新编译的次数，让整体编译更加迅速
优化效果
首先来看下Kotlin官方的数据， 以下基准测试结果在 Kotlin 项目中的 kotlin-gradle-plugin 模块上测得：

可以看出，当缓存命中时有86%到96%的加速效果，当缓存没有命中时也有26%的加速效果
我在项目中开启后实测效果也很不错，修改一个底层模块，在特性开启前需要耗时4分钟左右，开启后增量编译耗时减少到30到40s，加速约85%
如何开启
在 gradle.properties 文件中设置以下选项即可使用新方式进行增量编译：
kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot&#x3D;true

对于增量编译，稳定性和可靠性至关重要。有时增量编译总会失效，Kotlin 1.7同样支持为编译任务创建编译报告，报告包含不同编译阶段的持续时间以及无法使用增量编译的原因，可以帮助你定位为什么增量编译失效了
关于编译报告的启用与使用可见：隆重推出 Kotlin 构建报告
原理解析
编译避免和增量编译
之前介绍了Kotlin 快速编译背后的黑科技，了解一下~，其实主要就是介绍了编译避免与增量编译
快速编译的一大核心是应用程序二进制接口 (ABI)。 如果两个类在用作编译类路径时可互换，则它们具有相同的 ABI。
这样说可能有点抽象，ABI通常是指类对外暴露的部分，比如函数声明。当我们修改函数体时，ABI是没有发生变化的，如果我们修改了函数声明，则ABI发…</span>

如果需要在 Android、 iOS、Web、Desktop 等平台快速实现如上图所示的动画效果，你第一考虑会怎么做？
也许你会说使用 Flutter ？不不不，如果还需要兼容多技术栈呢？例如支持 Flutter 、React、Vue、C++ 等不同语言和技术平台呢？
这时候也许你会想到 Lottie ，诚然 Lottie 的动画效果确实十分优秀，也支持 Android、 iOS、React Native、Web、 Windows 等平台，但是它的输入来源于 After Effects 动画特效，并且依赖于 Bodymovin 插件，这对于个人开发或者  UI 设计师来说，从 0 开始学习的门槛还是不低的。

而本篇将给你推荐另外一个更简单又强大的动画开发平台： rive  ，对于 rive 可能大家会感觉比较陌生，做过 Flutter 开发的可能对 rive 会有所耳闻，因为 rive 在此之前叫 flare ，是 2dimensions 公司的开源动画产品，在发布之初由于和 Flutter 团队有深入合作，所以在初期一直是 Flutter 官方推荐的动画框架。
后来由于 flare 项目被合并所以升级为 rive ，升级后的 rive 开始把动画效果拓展到全平台，这个全平台不只是物理设备的全平台，还包括了跨语言和框架的全平台，不过可惜和第一代 flare 存在断档不兼容。





本篇之所以推荐 rive 来实现多端动画，主要有以下几个原因：
支持手机端、Web 端 和PC 端等平台支持
支持 React 、Flutter、Unity 等多种框架，Vue 和 Angular 也有社区支持
支持 JS、Dart、C++ 等多种语言

前言
前一阵子帮业务同学解决了个代码问题，其实挺有意思的，就打算和大家分享下这个内容。
先简单的介绍下背景，业务同学写了个apt的框架，然后里面包含一个注解的库，而注解库中需要使用到Android源码中的View。但是因为这是一个Java Library，无法直接将安卓的源码添加到依赖中，就无法引用到View。然后他们为了解决这个问题，又创建了一个库，然后生成了一个同包名的Android View，类似下图这总，然后compileOnly这个库。

因为这个模块内有了这个View，业务同学在后续调试系统源码的时候都会进到这个造假出来的View上去了，就产生了很大的干扰作用。原因呢其实就是因为这个类呗添加到sourceSet中了，同名类的情况下会优先使用上层加载的。
这种在java库内需要造假出一些Android View,就变成了一个很好玩的东西了。接下来我们就通过gradle的一些简单的操作，来把这个坑填上。
详细代码可以看下这个  Router-Android
Gradle Java Compiler Task
在build.gradle中，我们可以声明一个task任务，然后声明这个任务继承的类型，让它变成一个可以java编译代码的任务。
task(&quot;stubLib&quot;, JavaCompile::class) {
    source(file(&quot;src/stub/java&quot;))
    classpath &#x3D; project.files(getAndroidJar(&quot;32&quot;))
    // libraries
    destinationDirectory.set(File(project.buildDir, &quot;/tmp/stubLibs&quot;))
}

                              <span>1、效果

2、前言
在开发中，随意拖拽可吸边的悬浮View还是比较常见的，这种功能网上也有各种各样的轮子，其实写起来并不复杂，看完本文，你也可以手写一个，而且不到400行代码就能实现一个通用的随意拖拽可吸边的悬浮View组件。
3、功能拆解

4、功能实现
4.1、基础实现
4.1.1、自定义view类
先定义一个FloatView类，继承自FrameLayout，实现构造方法。
创建一个ShapeableImageView，并添加到这个FloatView中。
class FloatView : FrameLayout {

    constructor(context: Context) : this(context, null)

    constructor(context: Context, attributeSet: AttributeSet?) : this(context, attributeSet, 0)

    constructor(context: Context, attributeSet: AttributeSet?, defStyle: Int) : super(context, attributeSet, defStyle) {
        initView()
    }

    private fun initView() {
        val lp &#x3D; LayoutParams(LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT)
        layoutParams &#x3D; lp

                              <span>I have a confession: I&#x27;m addicted to Wordle. Especially now that it&#x27;s out of style and people don&#x27;t post about it. I love that it&#x27;s short, I can solve one word and then it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t feel too bad about the addiction and wasting my time with a game. This cloud debugger tutorial is an enormous challenge for me since the target is a Wordle game. But I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself.
As part of the Lightrun Playground we recently released we needed a demo application that will let developers who are new to Lightrun, practice in a &quot;safe environment&quot;.We decided to pick Wordle as our demo application because it&#x27;s instantly familiar, visual and not too interactive. A Flappy Bird demo might have been painful to debug. At this point our key challenge was in creating a bug where the debugging process…</span>

                              <span>เนื่องจาก Go 1.18 เริ่มใช้ generic แล้ว ซึ่งใน block ก่อนหน้านี้ ผมก็นำเอา blog ต้นฉบับของ contributors มาแปลคร่าวๆให้ได้อ่านกัน ทำให้ได้รู้ usecases ของการใช้ generic ว่าปกติจะใช้กับ ฟังก์ชั่นที่ ทำงานกับ map, slice หรือ channel เป็นหลัก และเอาจริงๆ หลายๆ usecases ที่คิดกันออกมา มันอาจจะทำงานกับ interface ได้ดีกว่า ที่จะพยายามยัดเยียดเอา generic ใส่เข้าไปเพื่อความเท่
วันนี้ก็เลยลองใช้ generic มาช่วยในการสร้าง gin HandlerFunc เพื่อให้เราสามารถเขียน handler ได้ง่ายขึ้นด้วยหน้าตาประมาณนี้
func Handler(request) (response,error)

ประโยชน์ก็คือ มันจะช่วยให้เราเขียนเทสให้ handler ง่ายขึ้น โดยไม่ต้อง mock gin.Context
โดยเราจะวางโครงสร้างโปรเจ็คเราแบบนี้

domain ภายในนี้จะเป็นที่รวม business logic ทั้งหมด
ginhandlerfunc เป็น converter ที่จะช่วยแปลง handler แบบที่เราอยากได้ ไปเป็น gin.HandlerFunc

                              <span>I noticed I&#x27;m always talking about canonical tags when advising fellow bloggers, but I never wrote this down on paper.
So here we go, an article explaining why you should always use canonical tags when republishing your content elsewhere.
Let&#x27;s first set a use case.
You are reading this article from one of the following three sources.
my blog (daily-dev-tips.com)
hashnode
dev.to
All these three sources have the same content.
Let&#x27;s say your blog does just that. How does Google know which blog to redirect to?
If you don&#x27;t provide a canonical tag, Google might even think you are spamming the internet and not showing any of the three sites!
However, you can use this canonical tag to set which site is the primary source for this article.
So what do I do, you ask?
So how do we set these canonical URLs
If you are not using a custom website as your primary source, you can set the canonical URL by adding the following tag in your HTML head.


This will tell the search engines they can find the original content on the address you provide there.
Most blogging platforms offer a more visual way of adding these canonical tags.
For instance, on Hashnode, they have the following widget in the sidebar.

And the same kind of graphical element exists on dev.to.

A small side note is that my good friend Graham suggests you wait two weeks before reposting your content.
This is, in theory, true.
Reposting content is a great way to reach a broader audience, but it can hurt your SEO if you don&#x27;t use canonical tags.
Do use canonical tags to indicate to search engines which is your original content.
Do not mix the canonicals to link to different articles from different sources.

  Introduction:


Redis is an in-memory database that stores data in key: value format, since it’s in memory, it&#x27;s ridiculously fast.
Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis …</span>

I am using Linux so selecting cloud-nuke_linux_amd64,
Now on your system create a folder called nuke, then cd into it 

wget https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/download/v0.16.2/cloud-nuke_linux_amd64 

Check the folder once copied the file us ls

lets rename the folder to aws-nuke mv cloud-nuke_linux_amd64 aws-cloud




Change folder permissions



sudo chmod 777 aws-nuke

lets copy this to /usr/bin



sudo cp aws-nuke /usr/bin

verify the package



aws-nuke

You will be able to similar result as shown in the screenshot

Now lets enter the magic command
aws-nuke aws


We are not done yet, 
It will preview all the services gonna be destroyed 
you will be prompted to confirm....
nuke

confirm by typing nuke

Hello! I recently heard about the PlanetScale X Hashnode hackathon, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. 
I decided to create a simple 1 to 1 meeting tool using WebRTC. 
The tech that was used to create the project is as follows:
React - To build the frontend
Nodejs - To build the backend
Express - To handle API requests
Socket.io - To handle WebSocket chat/signalling
PlanetScale - The database
Material-ui - For the design
Heroku - To host the app
The page that the user is first greeted with when loading the app is the create room page:

Yes, I know it&#x27;s very simple. 😅
The user can then create a new room by clicking on the &quot;Create Room&quot; button, this sends a request to the server which then creates a new room and stores the room key inside the planetscale database.
Once the room …</span>

                              <span>I love unit tests. Magic and its satellite projects has 1,000+ unit tests, and some of the satellite projects even has 100% unit test coverage. Statically analysing code using automation is (duh!) kind of important to us. However, unit testing frontend code is quite frankly (probably) ridiculous.
Unit tests are for small units of logic, to automatically ensure that your code is (still) valid as you refactor it, and/or add features to it. If you put logic that requires unit testing into your frontend code, you are probably doing something wrong.
90% of all projects I have worked with in my professional life were enterprise administration tools, and/or customer facing websites, hubs, and registration forms, etc. If you put business logic into these frontend projects, you risk that some smart…</span>

                              <span>This post is about transforming an already defined polyadic function into a curried function.
This is the third post in a series on curried functions titled Curry Functions in JavaScript. This follows the previous post named Basic Curried Functions in JavaScript.
Basic curried functions are different from more advanced ones because basic currying doesn&#x27;t involve taking a function as an argument, whereas more advanced ones do. Basic curried functions are defined from scratch, whereas advanced currying involves using an already existing multary function.
From a higher level, currying is more of an approach of transforming an otherwise uncurried function to return a series of unary functions - regardless of whether it is hardcoded by the author or transformed at runtime.

Analogue 宣布将在其 Pocket 游戏机上推出《太空战！》游戏，这是一款最初为 PDP-1 小型机设计的游戏，比《Pong》整整早了十年。《太空战！》最初由 MIT 的工程师们于 1962 年创作，使用了一台 PDP-1 小型机和 1024x1024 像素的 CRT 显示器。游戏中，两个飞船在一颗恒星的引力井中进行对决。重新发布该游戏的第三方开发商使用了 OpenFPGA 和已经属于公共领域的 PDP-1 和《太空战！》的源代码。

一少年向上万人出售远程访问间谍软件，赚取 30 万美元

现年 24 岁的一位澳大利亚人基恩据称在其 15 岁时开发了一个远程访问间谍软件，允许用户远程控制其受害者的电脑。一旦安装了该工具，就可以用来窃取受害者的个人信息，通过网络摄像头和麦克风监视他们，并跟踪他们在电子邮件或文件中输入的内容。据称，基恩在一个黑客论坛上以 35 美元的价格出售该工具，向 128 个国家的 14500 多人出售该工具，赚取了 30 万至 40 万美元。现在他和他的母亲已经被指控多项罪名。

典型的键盘只有约 100 个键位。

由于 Shift 键，许多键得以有两个字符（也称之为 字形glyph）。字形常用于键入带有重音和变音符号的字母，生成数学公式或者货币中的符号，或者添加有趣的表情符号。在一些地区，有些键甚至有三个字形。

然而，不论你身处何处，有一些字形不会出现在你的键盘上。幸运的是，Linux 提供了使用 组合键Compose Key 来获取这些字形。

在你的键盘上没有组合键这个键，至少默认情况下没有，但是你可以设定一个你不用的键作为组合键。我在电脑上使用空格键旁边的 Alt 键，而在平板上使用菜单键，来作为组合键。

                              <span>本文将帮助你设计一个基于 Web 的应用程序，使用 Node-RED 为地铁站的汽车提供一个自动智能停车系统。




Web 应用程序是在 Web 服务器上运行的软件。终端用户通过 Web 浏览器访问 Web 应用程序。Web 应用程序使用客户端—服务器（C/S）架构进行编程，该架构是用户（客户端）通过远程服务器（可能由第三方托管）提供服务。Web API（应用程序编程接口）在整个 Web 上是可用的，用户可以通过 HTTP 协议访问该接口，如图 1 所示。



本文将演示如何为地铁设计一个基于 Web 的汽车自动智能停车系统。 它是使用开源的 Node-RED 设计。该系统使用模板节点创建了一个交互式的、时尚的用户登录表单，用 HTML 和 CSS 编码以获取车主的详细信息，从而实现停车系统的自动化。我们可以在图 2 和图 3 看到登录表单和提交表单的流程图。

使用的节点如下：



地铁智能停车节点流程设计

Node-RED 由 node-red 命令激活。访问网址 http://127.0.0.1:1880/ 可以看到 Node-RED 用户界面流程浏览器已经启用，可以认为 Node-RED 设置已完成，可以正常工作了。

按照下面给出的步骤创建登录表单和提交表单。





登录表单

1、在节点画布中，拖放 http 输入http in 节点，这会为创建 Web 服务创建一个 HTTP 访问点。

2、将 http 输入http in 节点连接到 函数function 节点。函数节点有助于编写 JavaScript 函数处理节点接收到的消息。



3、将 函数function 节点连接到 模板template 节点，模板节点基于提供的模板创建一个 Web API。

Pop!_OS 是 最好的初学者友好的 Linux 发行版 之一。

它基于 Ubuntu，显然，Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 是基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的。

然而，与 Ubuntu 不同，Pop!_OS 22.04 在发布时并没有正式支持树莓派。

因此，期待 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 版本对树莓派的支持是合理的。

如果你还记得，System76 在 Pop!_OS 21.10 中首次增加了对树莓派的支持。我们在测试时也 报道过。

而且，据 System76 的首席工程师 Jeremy Soller 透露， System76 最新的 Pop!_OS 版本现在正准备支持树莓派 4。

Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS for Raspberry Pi 4

如果你一直在你的树莓派 4 上使用 Pop!_OS 21.10，这对你来说是个好消息。

而且，对于任何想在树莓派 4 上尝试 Pop!_OS 的人来说，它终于有了一个 LTS 版本。

截至目前，该 ISO 是作为技术预览版提供的。因此，如果你想试试它，你应该有出现错误和可用性问题的心理预期。请注意，目前还 只限于树莓派 4，不支持其他树莓派设备，这是个遗憾。

我们不知道 System76 是否计划在这个 LTS 版本中支持其他树莓派板，或者他们是否坚持只支持树莓派 4。

然而，考虑到树莓派 4 现在相当流行，对于许多寻求替代 Ubuntu 的 树莓派的替代操作系统 的爱好者们来说，这应该是一个很好的进展。

有了 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS，树莓派 4 的用户应该能够体验到一些最令人兴奋的升级，以及更新的 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。

要下载该技术预览版，请前往 Pop!_OS 的 官方网站，点击下载按钮，找到该选项。



你对树莓派 4 上的 Pop!_OS 22.04 有什么期望？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。

日常工作语言是 Go ，由于项目是微服务，经常需要打开十几个项目，并且来回切换。
之前使用的是 Goland ，使用体验非常棒，但是由于打开的项目很多，导致内存不够用(电脑是 32g 内存的 mac)，会偶尔卡死。而且项目使用的依赖很多很大，更新依赖后，goland 重新索引非常耗时，而且会导致电脑严重发热、卡顿。
由于公司提供了开发机，且配置很高(32 核 64g ssd)，最近改用了 vscode +remote ，确实很香，文件和依赖都在开发机上，索引也在开发机，本地只是 gui ，用了之后再也没卡过。但是 remote 下好几有几个 bug ，timeline 不显示。试了下，用 vscode 打开本地 git 项目 timeline 是可以的。
还有就是有时候智能提示比较卡，输入了之后过几秒才给建议
有 v 友知道 timeline 怎么解决吗</span>

我的意见和上面的一样
axios 只用 必须的中间件 比如刷新 token 和 retry 这样的
别的都不封装的</span>

首先说明用户主要是喷的戴尔，我不反对用户喷戴尔，我自己也天天喷戴尔垃圾设计，垃圾散热。
这位用户，通过闲鱼购买机器，详情页与私聊沟通都已经说过了机器无法退货，有问题只能换货。
收到后首台确实有点问题（我能看出图片有色差），积极协调换货后，表示仍然有问题，然后用户再找戴尔；
此时新机器照片看不出有问题（用户表示肉眼可以看到有问题），所以戴尔不愿意派单；
此时用户找到我表示要 315 投诉 工商局投诉戴尔之类的，我说不需要那么麻烦，通过闲鱼购买的投诉也不会受理。我协调戴尔帮你换机就是举手之劳，后来我协调后戴尔再次换机给用户，用户表示不想开盲盒了，于是新收到的机器我转售给了我的朋友，并给用户退款。
至此我感觉是三赢，用户退机了，我不用整天陪聊了，我朋友低于成本价买到了机器
但是在 6 月 6 日退款给用户后，然后用户昨天用户发了一个视频：
视频内容中，喷显示器的部分，我完全没有任何意见，我欢迎任何人喷任何产品，喷的人多了才有改善。
但是我帮他忙前忙后一两个月协调，在视频中由于我某天回复稍慢，挂我说我装死，然后说我在闲鱼卖东西不提供三包侵犯他的权益，说我偷税漏税，就有点心寒了，同期我在淘宝也上架了这个显示器，价格贵 200 ，有票有三包，不知道是什么特别的缘分让我们相遇在闲鱼。

我在自己的 hobby project 中习惯使用 Tailwind CSS 和 UnoCSS ，觉得开发效率很高，但在工作中需要遵循组内规范使用 Sass 。那么，有没有可能先用原子化 CSS 的写法进行开发，但在 git commit 前用工具转换成 Sass/Less ？
设想的工作流：
先把样式统统写在 class 里，然后用一个 CLI 工具转换，或者用一个 VSCode 插件“重构”。得到的结果是源文件中 JSX 或模版里的长串 class 名被替换成单个随机名称（后续按照其用途人工重命名），并生成一份对应的带嵌套层级的 sass/less 文件。
概括需求：
想一个英文宣传语就是：Write in &quot;Atomic CSS&quot; way, convert to nested CSS before you commit.
是否已有此类型的工具？如果没有，开发一个有意义和技术上的可能性吗？
相似但不太一样的方案：
1. 了解到 Windi CSS 有一个 Compilation Mode https://windicss.org/posts/modes.html#compilation-mode ，能把一串 class 转化为形如“windi-15wa4me”的单个 class 名，但它这个应该是在编译时生成的产物中出现，而我希望在开发时提交组件的源代码到 GitLab 前就做转换。
2. Tailwind CSS 有 shortcuts ，Sass 有 apply ，但这两者都需要在项目里额外配置 Tailwind CSS ，并且也没那么方便进行“一把梭”了，和这个想法的初衷不符。</span>

请问 PC 旧桌面软件现代化，有哪些方案？
我这边有不少旧软件（工具类）的 UI 和设计风格都很落后。 
鉴于 Win7 、Win8 微软都已停止支持，目前大多数设备使用 Win10 及以上的系统。 
准备把一些旧软件进行改造，UI 和设计风格弄好看点，更好适配系统的风格
个人是准备用 WinUI2.8 ，XAML Islands 之类的 [参考官方的升级方案] ： 
https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/
就是不知道坑多不多，大概要花多久。
或者有没有其他更好的方案？比如：前端 UI 框架重写？只考虑兼容 Win10 以及以上系统。</span>

背景
手机双卡。主卡（本人实名）用于日常通信与扫码，副卡（家庭号、非本人实名）用于流量与收发快递。前几日副卡收到流调短信
过程
坐标成都，人在武侯区与双流区交界，上周确实到到访过成华区，短信内容属实
疑问
流调基于什么条件判断，除去健康码与行程码，是否有其他渠道？
仅副卡收到流调短信，主卡却没有？
主副卡是否可能已被识别并认定为同一人使用？
补充
健康码、行程码全程使用支付宝小程序端，不存在 APP 越权导致隐私泄漏的情况
主副卡均非成都本地号，但副卡是四川境内号
猜想
据了解，行程码基于移动基站定位，两张卡均会在成华区留下记录，但行程码目前是不能定位到具体区县的
家庭号中其他人没有收到相关短信，说明与实名没有关系</span>

参考教程
系统是 centos7
主要参考了两个教程
http://www.zzvips.com/article/4671.html
https://blog.csdn.net/qq_21279961/article/details/118567506
遇到问题
服务都可以运行，直接在服务器上 curl 百度是可以的，但是谷歌不行，换了一些站点发现好像是强制 https 的无法代理
curl www.baidu.com --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 -U xxx:xxx

再到本地测试就蒙了，time out ，防火墙里端口是已经开放了的，不知道是因为什么
curl www.baidu.com --socks5 104.xxx.149.xxx:1080 -U xxx:xxx

看了进程列表，发现每一个挂起的请求对应了一个 SYN_RECV
大概是因为客户端没有回应ACK?
但是又不太像，手机和电脑试了都不行

求解答
这个问题昨晚熬夜到早上 7 点多，自己一个人纠结查了很多东西，但是迫于储备知识有限不知道怎么解决，睡觉睡的都不安稳，脑子里全是这个问题，一醒来就向大家求助了
主要问题就是两个
HTTPS 链接问题
外部无法链接问题</span>

跨城出行，2 大人 2 儿童。全程 215 公里，耗时 223 分钟，平台支付 446 - 20 元，线下支付高速路费 88 元。
预约后三分钟内接单，提前 25 分钟到小区门口等待
上车后要求线下交易且加价至 700 元
在高德平台投诉之，补偿 20 元优惠券
立即接单
上车后要求加价「返程空驶费」 200 元
下车立即电话投诉之，给予调换车辆服务
接单后声称需中途服务区充电 30~60 分钟
担心是据单托辞，反复确认后表示充电休息没问题
一路平稳驾驶相安无事，中途服务区休息充电约 70 分钟
高铁耗时约 210 分钟：在途 81 + 候车 30 + 打车来回高铁站 60 + 进出站 40
高铁耗资约 400 元：高铁票 106 × 3 + 打车来回 80
提前一天尝试预约顺风车，平台报价 300 元，但无人接单。
滴滴「一口价」 510 元，未包含路桥费。
感慨：
选择跨城打车，老人小孩能少一些折腾；但极大提高了出行的不确定性，要避坑心智负担很大。
网约车司机果然很多是过去的黑车司机换层皮，看我拖家带口的好欺负呢。
所以滴滴罚款时我旗帜鲜明支持网约车出行平台，技术进步促进社会进步。
网约车平台还是缺乏有质量的竞争，滴滴赢者通吃，后来者互相摆烂。
不了解跨城打车机制，针对这种低频但高风险需求，「抢单」和「派单」孰优？如何计算价格能使乘客司机平台三赢？</span>

买了个五角螺丝刀拆开后盖清了清灰，应该是全原装。升级到最新系统，也还比较流畅。

用 ps -lp

PRI 值越低，优先级越高。所以，后台进程应该降低优先级，来省电；前台进程应该提高优先级，来提升流畅度。
但是，以微信为例，它长期在后台运行的进程 PRI 值都是 4 ，打开窗口后 PRI 值变为 55 ，关闭窗口后变为 61.为什么它会有 PRI 为 4 的时候？这不符合常理呀。从 55 变为 61 倒是符合降低优先级来省电的理论。此外，NICE 值全程是 0.</span>

                              <span>YSLucida: 本人毫无移动端应用的开发经验，android iOS 都没有。平时主要是桌面端开发。由于现在需要快速支持 iOS SDK 专属的一些特性，原有的代码是 C++。也就是想通过 C++来包装 iOS SDK 的一些接口。这个 SDK 有 objective-c 和 swift 两种接口，我大概看了一下 objective-c 和 c++是比较好交互的。
第一个问题：想问一下 c++和 swift 在跨语言调用上有没有最佳实践方案？或者说我这种需求是不是直接用 objective-c 来做？
下面两个问题的前提都是想在前期免去学习 objc 和 swift 语言以及相应 SDK 的成本，只是想先把核心跑起来，在能跑起来的前提下再学 SDK 也不迟。
第二个问题：由于想先快速实现一个原型 app 用于测试，一个 iOS 应用能不能用纯 C++写？其实这个测试应用不需要多么复杂的功能，只需要能运行最终调用一下 SDK 的一些 api 就行了，哪怕交互的部分不上 UI 先硬编码也行。就像 windows 下的控制台应用一样。
第三个问题：由于集成这个功能需要访问文件系统，也就是需要像在桌面端打开某个路径下某个文件。大概了解了一下，iOS 也是 POSIX 兼容，目前打算如果先用 C++实现的话，可以调 posix 兼容的 fopen 等来暂时应对，不过据了解好像由于 iOS 的 app 是运行在沙箱环境里的，实际运行的时候 fopen 是打不开的。所以有没有办法暂时回避这个问题？这个 app 不发行，只用于在自己的手机上测试，能不能在不越狱的情况下搞定这个问题？
由于本人在这方面的经验为零，所以有些问题可能不专业，有问题的地方请指正。</span>

                              <span>前阵子收到了小宇宙的消息推送，我才发现不知不觉，我已经在小宇宙听了 200 小时播客了，最开始只是偶尔听听，后来越来越喜欢，几乎每天只有有空就都要打开小宇宙，把听播客这个习惯无缝融入到了我的日常 routine 中。
今天这一篇，我想复盘一下在我从播客萌新到播客重度听众的这 200 个小时，我的一些收获和体验，以及对播客这一种内容形式的思考。
我喜欢听哪些播客？
我收听的播客领域主要集中在这几类：互联网、商业分析、心理学、轻松休闲类。
📻互联网行业：三五环、温柔一刀、组织进化论等等；
📻商业分析：无人知晓、疯投圈；
📻心理学：得意忘形；
📻轻松休闲类：日谈公园、谐星聊天会；
我一般都是在家用电脑做一些不需要太集中精力的工作的时候，会去听我喜欢的一些有信息量的播客，收听到有价值的信息的时候，会直接打开电脑上的记事本，或者用 flomo 记录下当时觉得有价值的信息和思考。
而一个人出门散步、吃饭的时候，会放日谈公园或者谐星聊天会这种信息浓度不高的播客，作为放松休闲的背景音。
我的小宇宙收听总结里收听时长最长的播客是张潇雨老师的《得意忘形》，刘飞老师的《三五环》以及孟岩老师的《无人知晓》。这三档播客也是我目前最喜欢的三档播客。

播客为什么吸引了我？
在听了 200 个小时的播客之后，我开始对播客这一内容形式有了一些思考，我开始想：
播客为什么吸引到了我，能让我愿意付出这么多时间去使用它？播客这一种内容形式，和其他的内容形式又有什么特别之处？
我尝试着从我自己作为普通用户的角度，也夹杂着我作为一个内容运营的看法，去解答这个问题：
1.仅限音频，收听便利，使用门槛低。
播客的内容只以音频形式呈现，只要用耳朵收听就可以了，与传统的信息摄入形式相比，解放了双手双眼，让信息输入的门槛低了很多；
所以比如在通勤的时候，散步的时候，坐在电脑前打字聊天的时候，在家里收拾家务的时候，很多…</span>

Netflix is suing Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, the duo behind The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical over copyright infringement, as first reported by Deadline. The streaming giant filed the complaint in a Washington, DC district court just days after Barlow and Bear held a live, sold-out show dedicated to their Bridgerton-inspired album.
After Bridgerton’s 2020 debut, Barlow and Bear began creating music based on the Netflix original series and promoting the endeavor on TikTok, where it quickly gained popularity. As fans requested more content, Barlow and Bear soon had enough to create a 15-song album that went on to win a Grammy in April, a first for music originating on TikTok. On July 26th, Barlow and Bear held a concert at the Kennedy...

China’s uncontrolled Long March 5B rocket reentered the Earth’s atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, landing somewhere near Sarawak, the Malaysian state on the island of Borneo. 
The US Space Command confirmed the rocket’s reentry at 12:45PM ET, but it remains unclear where its debris landed. In a translated post on Weibo, China’s Manned Space Agency said the rocket reentered near the same area, and that most of it burned up on its way down.
Uncertainty about where the rocket would land rippled across the globe
On July 24th, China used a Long March 5B rocket to launch a lab module to its unfinished Tiangong space station. Unlike most rockets, the Long March 5B thrusts its first stage into orbit when delivering its payload. This piece, which...

The Indonesian government has blocked access to a range of online services, including Steam, Epic Games, PayPal, and Yahoo after the companies failed to comply with a new requirement related to the country’s restrictive content moderation laws, as reported earlier by Reuters. 
In line with the rules, companies deemed “Private Electronic System Providers” must register with the government’s database to operate in the country, or otherwise face a nationwide ban. Indonesia gave companies until July 27th to comply and has since banned those that haven’t. 
The requirement is part of an overarching law, called MR5

The Pixel 2 is an almost five-year-old phone, but it introduced a feature that I miss more and more with each passing year. It was called Active Edge, and it let you summon Google Assistant just by giving your phone a squeeze. In some ways, it’s an unusual idea. But it effectively gave you something sorely lacking on modern phones: a way to physically interact with the phone to just get something done.
Looking at the sides of the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, you won’t see anything to indicate that you’re holding anything special. Sure, there’s a power button and volume rocker, but otherwise, the sides are sparse. Give the phone’s bare edges a good squeeze, though, and a subtle vibration and animation will play, as Google Assistant pops up from the...

Google has a delightful new multiplayer Doodle that lets you play a game of pétanque online. If you haven’t heard of pétanque — I hadn’t before writing this article — it’s a game that’s kind of like bocce ball.
The goal of pétanque is to throw your ball (the boule) as close as you can to a little ball (the cochonnet) on the playing field in front of you. On your computer, you’ll “throw” the ball by clicking on the boule and dragging back with your mouse to slingshot it forward; on a phone, you’ll toss the boule with your thumb (kind of like throwing a Poké Ball in Pokémon Go). You get points for having more boules close to the cochonnet than your opponent, and whoever has the most points after three rounds wins. Google has a good...

Apple Pay could finally be compatible with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox in iOS 16. MacRumors contributor Steve Moser found that Apple Pay works with Edge and Chrome in the iOS 16 beta 4, and shared his findings on Twitter.
Moser’s screenshots show a “Continue with Apple Pay” option on Apple’s checkout page when using Edge. Apple Pay only works in Safari on iOS 15 and older, preventing you from using any other browser if you want to pay with Apple Pay when shopping on the web.
On the latest iOS 16 beta Apple Pay works in Edge, Chrome and I assume any third party browser. On iOS 15 Apple Pay only works in Safari. pic.twitter.com/x7zV5xCuiC

Amazon Prime Day is back, baby! OK, maybe not technically speaking, but so many Amazon devices are currently discounted at Best Buy and other retailers that it&#x27;s giving us a major sense of deja vu. Right now, for example, you can buy Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat at Best Buy and Target for just $41.99 ($18 off) — a record low set during Prime Day. 
The budget-friendly thermostat will mesh with most decor, and can even learn and adapt to your habits like more expensive options. Be aware, however, that you can’t integrate the device with voice assistants beyond Alexa, and there are no native temperature sensors. Still, if those caveats don’t bother you, Amazon’s Smart Thermostat is a great option to consider, one that could...

Once upon a time, my smartphone doubled as my most-used gaming platform. It’s hard to believe now, but there was once a period when app stores felt like a new frontier, and game developers had a blast experimenting with a little touchscreen rectangle that you always had in your pocket. Then the economics changed. Games slowly got cheaper before eventually becoming free altogether. New releases had to decide between a dwindling audience for premium games or saddling their game with in-app purchases. Things became dire. But lately, I’ve been having fun with my phone again — and it’s due almost entirely to subscription services.
I came to this realization recently when I switched from Android to an iPhone and started loading my new gadget...

One truth about me as a runner is that I need my jams. No jams, no run. I have meticulously curated playlists where the bass drops are strategically timed to gas me up when I lose steam. Aside from my sneakers, my earbuds are the most important piece of running tech I own. And yet, my decade-long search for the perfect pair only just ended a few weeks ago. 
Behold, the beautiful, purplicious Beats Fit Pro.
To understand why I’m gaga for these buds, you need to know about the headphones that didn’t make the cut. (Don’t worry, I’ll stick to the highlights and spare you a Dickensian-length novel recounting the dozens of earbuds that have failed me in my 10-year running journey.)

Uber says that it’s “completely reimagined the way drivers accept rides” with a feature called “upfront fares,” which shows drivers exactly how much they’ll be paid for a trip and where they’ll end up after dropping a rider off. In its announcement on Friday, the company says the change is part of its push to make driving for the rideshare service more flexible. Uber’s also planning on rolling out a feature that lets drivers see other ride requests in their area, letting them pick specific trips they’d like to do. 
For riders, the changes, which have been tested in select locations, could mean fewer canceled trips because a driver doesn’t actually want to go to the destination, or realizes that it won’t be a very profitable trip.

What is Kubernetes? 🤔
Kubernetes(K8s) is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 😵‍💫


Did not get it? ☹️, I know!
Kubernetes solves a major problem with docker containers or any type of container. 🛠️

Arduino is an opensource electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor , a finger on a button , or a twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor , turning on a LED , publishing something online. To do so use the Arduino programming language (based on wiring) and the Arduino Software (IDE) based on processing.
An infrared sensor is an electronic device that emits and/or detects infrared radiation in order to sense some aspects of its surroundings.

First we start off with a naming convention and then how we can use Page Object Pattern to our advantage.  
Have a look at the end result of the tests.



This is pretty much a no-brainer, but becomes very important the bigger the project is. If you utilize your naming properly, you will be able to abstract your tests in a very neat way. For instance, you can build selectors based on your component names and actions. What I often do is:

So does that mean you can’t use a replication controller if you plan to have a single POD? No! Even if you have a single POD, the replication controller can help by automatically bringing up a new POD when the existing one fails. Thus the replication controller ensures that the specified number of PODs are running at all times. Even if it’s just 1 or 100. 





Another reason we need replication controller is to create multiple PODs to share the load across them. For example, in this simple scenario we have a single POD serving a set of users.

We&#x27;ll be looking at a couple of levels of changes. Each one required a slightly different approach.
You have not yet committed the changes

Undo a pushed commit
Note: This article describes the commands. Most GUI&#x27;s have a visual integration for these commands.
It could happen that you have made some changes, but then you quickly realize that you did something that isn&#x27;t right and should be reverted.
Note: you can use git status to see all open changes
Take the file name of the file you want to revert and execute the following command.
git checkout filename.extension

This command will revert the file to what it used to be.

In this blog, I&#x27;ll be explaining about test-driven development (TDD) and a how-to guide to TDD with python. In case you didn&#x27;t even hear about it, also tag along.
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. In short, It is when you write tests before you write the code that&#x27;s being tested.
It has number of benefits

Curse.
Blessing.
Lesson.
Bugs can be a lesson and a curse so how do we manage them, one way I learned when I attended havards cs50 computer science course is by speaking to a rubber duck, ok not necessarily a rubber duck but speak to something or someone-if they understand what you&#x27;re saying- explain your step by step approach to the program and what you wrote, chances are you&#x27;ll find the error you&#x27;re looking for or where you went wrong and you can solve it or google it. Also feel free to take breaks when debugging your codes, something as simple as taking walks, playing with your pet, or going out with someone can clear your head and when you come back, you&#x27;ll be ready to squash that bug.
Thanks for reading, hope it helps, like and comment on ways you cool off to debug your codes.</span>

                              <span>I recently came across a twitter post where the user challenged others if they knew the difference between the js methods .slice() and .splice() without googling them. A lot of people mixed them up.
So I&#x27;ve created this simplified cheat sheet of everything you need to know about the 2 methods.
.slice() and splice() are both array methods. 


both of them return arrays as outputs


the key is to pay attention the what they return as the output array and if they mutate the original array (they one on which the were applied to)
.slice() returns selected elements in an array, as a new array. Selection is done by index.


.slice() does not affect the original array



With splice() you can select one or more elements. 
For example: This code snippet returns 3 (which is at index 2)
[1,2,3,4,5].slice(2) // returns 3 (which is at index 2)

and this code snippet returns 2,3,4 (from index 1 to 4 exclusively)
[1,2,3,4,5].slice(1,4) // returns 2,3,4 (from index 1 to 4 exclusively)

.splice modifies the original array (adds and/or removes elements from the array)


The method returns the original array **modified**



With splice you can:
 remove elements




[1,2,3,4,5].splice(3) // returns [1,2,3] (first 3 elements)
[1,2,3,4,5].splice(2,2) // at position 2 remove 2 elements (returns [1,2,5])

 add elements





[1,2,5].splice(2,0,3,4) // at postion 2 add 2 elements (returns [1,2,3,4,5])


 remove and add elements at the same time




// at position 2, remove 1 elements and add 2 new items
[1,2,3,4,5].splice(2,2,&quot;HTML&quot;,&quot;CSS&quot;) // returns [1,2,&quot;HTML&quot;,&quot;CSS&quot;,5]

Remember: .splice() mutates the array, .slice() does not!

之前想着断舍离，注销掉大部分银行卡的，但现在不断了。
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
以前办卡是真的特别容易，那时因为卡面图案相当漂亮就多办很多。
现在发现银行卡注销特别容易，反而新办就比较困难。
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
&gt; 比如工商银行我去问了，如果新办的话，只能办二类卡，
&gt; 有诸多限制，比如转账汇款单日最多 1w 等。

那么不知道我这么多卡应该怎么管理？
&gt; 不是记账，不是记账，只是管理银行卡。

比如有些卡不久就过有效期了。
还有很多卡密码也忘记了，有空我也要跑一下银行密码找回来。</span>

最近整理了一下电脑，然后开始整备份。
备份的话，貌似最简单的办法是买几个移动硬盘？机械移动硬盘体质一般般，就怕摔一下，或者遇到品控不好的硬盘，反正总觉得不是很牢靠。SSD 更不打算考虑，整理出来的数据量大约 10T 不到，买多块大容量的 SSD 还是比较贵的。
然后开始考虑买个 NAS ，其实我已经考虑很久了，组装机、品牌机的方案都考虑过，但最后还是没有选择。主要是 NAS 提供的各种功能我并不需要，我不跑虚拟机、Docker ，不需要局域网串流多媒体，我只要个牢靠的地方多保存一份数据的副本。
最后花钱买了磁带（ LTO-5 ），便宜是真便宜，机房淘汰的机器 1K （免费赠送 HBA 卡），二手磁带 30 块一卷，LTO-5 磁带的非压缩容量是 1.5TB ，10 盘磁带如果完全不压缩的话可以装 15T ，才 300 块钱，比很多 Switch 游戏卡带还便宜……
一家德企还提供了免费的磁带备份软件，提供一些诸如文件浏览、文件打包、增量备份之类的基本功能，个人用用足够了
磁带写好后扔箱子里塞沙发底下了，增量备份的话，目测半年搞一次就行了，唯一美中不足的是，LTO-5 容量还是小了点（本想上 LTO-6 的，但是 LTO-6 机器贵了不少），然后每年要倒带一次，把磁带卷紧，算是维护吧。</span>

扫描搜索无线会导致后台无法进入，原因不明，需拔电重启方可访问后台，这样就无法 WiFi 中继了
不支持热插拔，因此需要开机前插入 USB
直接后台上传 luci-app-开放冲突_x.xx.xx-beta_all.ipk 安装失败，只需将提示缺少的依赖在后台软件包更新列表后搜索安装，然后再次安装即可
装完刷新网页也找不到，需要重启路由器才能在服务列表里看到
三个内核更新都失败，需要手动下载本地，然后上传对应路径，再设置文件可执行权限：chmod +x 冲突 冲突_meta 冲突_tun
建议开启自动更新白名单功能并手动更新一次
经测试，混合模式网速最快
访问 R2S 后台的主地址（默认 192.168.2.1 ）才能进入开放冲突控制版面，跨网段的 IP 虽然可以访问 OpenWrt 后台，但是无法打开开放冲突控制版面
怕死哦、酸酸乳 Plus 、v 酸酸乳上传 ipk 包安装失败，提示缺失的依赖都无法在后台直接搜索安装</span>

用这个 Tech Preview 的大多都是 Apple Silicon 的用户吧，虽然是 Universal Binary
个人认为比较重要的几个更新点：
添加了对 Windows ARM 的支持
Linux 可以用新的内核了
建议在安装的时候看一看 Testing Guide ，有 known issues
昨天更新了一下
Windows ARM 的支持只能说「能用」，不支持剪切板、文件共享、自适应分辨率，没有图形加速，动画卡卡的。不过之前没有用过 windows arm ，发现模拟出来的 x64dbg 调试 x86 应用能正常使用，还是比较惊喜的
Linux Kernel 的版本要求比较高，5.18/5.19 （如果需要 3d 图形加速）。官方测试过的只有 Fedora 、Debian Testing 。Ubuntu 的最新内核还不能启动</span>

个人体验过，也觉得很难用。
比如，我第一次看到 ui 框架会跟一个 ui 库深度绑定的，
还有，启动速度真的是极慢，
文档写的真的不好，相比 next.js 的文档，umi 这边看起来就有点业余。
你们还碰到其它问题嘛？</span>

烦透了印象笔记的各种广告以及流氓行为，在到期之前成功迁移到 notion ，分享一下我迁移的方式。
在网上搜到这篇文章：
印象笔记近乎完美的迁移至 Notion
就是这个开源的插件：
https://github.com/vzhd1701/enex2notion 
只需要安装旧版本的印象笔记，将笔记本组导出成 enex 格式，然后导入 notion 即可。
一个旧版本的 macOS 安装包，仅供参考：

如题，想在容器启动时 自动 启动 ssh-server ，同时启动 Spring 项目。
但是 Google 搜索的大部分都是 直接使用 SpringBoot 的 Docker Image 去启动项目。
目前想用自己的一个自定义的容器去做这些事... 就是在 Docker 容器启动的时候，自动去执行某些启动脚本。
容器已经设置了 --restart&#x3D;always ，但是实测，宿主机重新启动的时候，不会执行 /etc/init.d 下面的脚本...
求助大佬..</span>

在汽车尤其是自动驾驶汽车上安放传感器涉及大量的变量，如底盘设计，有没有障碍物（不同位置提供了不同视野），风阻和重量平衡等等，这需要大量的试错，不同的车型还需要重新制定不同的方案。宝马汽车的问题涉及到了 3854 个变量和 500 个约束条件，经典计算机解决这个问题需要大量的时间。量子计算公司 QCI 使用的是其新量子硬件，在 6 分钟内解决了该问题，提供了一个由 15 个传感器构成的方案。

老王点评：看来网盘服务盈利前景堪忧啊，有这个风向标，国内的网盘服务会如何呢？




QEMU 7.1 将带来龙芯架构支持

QEMU 7.1-rc0 已经发布，其稳定版本将在几周后发布。QEMU 7.1 将初始支持 64 位龙芯架构的 3A5000 系列 SoC。QEMU 7.1 也将支持更多的 RISC-V 特性，如 RISC-V 特权规格 1.12 版，改进的 PMU 实现，Zmmul 扩展等。对于 QEMU 迁移，它现在支持 Linux 上的零拷贝发送，以减少源主机上的 CPU 使用率。

记录 Flutter 开发过程中遇到的一些问题和相关的解决方案～
1. --no-sound-null-safety 错误 on vscode
上面是 VSCode 编辑器中空校验错误。解决方案如下：
// vscode 编辑器项目根目录中创建文件 .vscode/launch.json
// 添加内容
&quot;args&quot;: [
  &quot;--no-sound-null-safety&quot;
]

// 完整的文件代码示例
{
  &quot;configurations&quot;:[
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;jimmy flutter demo&quot;,
      &quot;program&quot;: &quot;lib/main.dart&quot;,
      &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dart&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;--no-sound-null-safety&quot;
      ]
    }
  ]
}

// 之后重新运行项目即可

2. 设置 flutter_screenutil 报错
直接引用包 flutter_screenutil 去使用，会报错使用不了 ScreenUtil().setWidth(width) 等方法。
这个错误就是我们并没有按照官网进行使用。需要根据官网逐步进行。
这里我使用方式一 -- 在app中使用它一次。
void main() &#x3D;&gt; runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //填入设计稿中设备的屏幕尺寸,单位dp

                              <span>1. 背景
最近一个需求改版UI视觉觉得微信朋友圈的边缘高斯模糊挺好看，然后就苦逼吭哧的尝试在Flutter实现了，来看微信朋友圈点击展开的大图效果图：

微信朋友圈高斯模糊效果大概分4部分区域实现，如下图：

居中图片为原始图，然后背景模糊全图是原始图放大cover模式的高斯模糊，在上下两个区域分别是两层单独处理边界的高斯模糊效果特殊处理，因此有时候可以看到微信朋友圈在上下两侧有明显分界线；
2. 实践
在Flutter侧实现高斯模糊比较简单，可以直接使用系统的BackdropFilter函数实现，需要传入一个filter方式，然后对child区域进行模糊过滤；
  const BackdropFilter({
    Key? key,
    required this.filter,
    Widget? child,
    this.blendMode &#x3D; BlendMode.srcOver,
  }) : assert(filter !&#x3D; null),
       super(key: key, child: child);     

Flutter提供了简化ImageFiltered实现高斯模糊，代码如下：
ImageFiltered(
    imageFilter: ImageFilter.blur(sigmaX: 20, sigmaY: 20),
    child: Image.network(url,fit: BoxFit.cover, height: expandedHeight, width: width),
),

通过此方式，可以非常简约实现全屏高斯模糊～，现在难点是上下边界区域的边界模糊处理，这里需要使用一个ShaderMask组件，在Flutter侧ShaderMask主要是实现渐变过渡能力的；

                              <span>如何在 Linux 终端中运行一个 Python 程序？像这样，对吗？

python program.py


然而，如果你试图在 Ubuntu（和其他一些发行版）中使用 python 命令，它会抛出一个错误。

command ‘python’ not found, did you mean:
command ‘python3’ from deb python3
command ‘python’ from deb python-is-python3


如果你注意这个错误信息，它说明了很多东西。这里的 python 命令实际上是 python3。

如果你不理解，不用担心。我将在这里详细解释。

为什么在 Ubuntu 上没有发现 python 命令？

这是因为 Python 语言不是以 python 的形式安装的，而是以 python3 或 python2 的形式安装的（在一些老的 Ubuntu 版本中）。

在遥远的过去的某个时间点，Python 实际上是作为 python 包/可执行文件提供的。当 Python 发布第二版时，Ubuntu 和其他发行版不得不同时支持 Python 1.x 和 2.x 版本。

因此，他们将较新的 Python 版本命名为 python2，以区分这两个版本。其他应用或库也在其代码中指定 python 或 python2。

最终，Python 1 版本被完全停用，但软件包继续被命名为 python2。

类似地，当 Python 3 版本发布时，发行版开始同时提供 python2 和 python3 包。

Python 2 不再被支持，Python 3.x 是你在 Ubuntu 上安装的版本。该软件包仍被命名为 python3。

总结一下，你已经在 Ubuntu 上安装了 Python。它是以…</span>

                              <span>如果你想获得安全的体验，你可能不会再继续使用 32 位 Linux 内核。




我们有很多 为 32 位系统定制的 Linux 发行版。

那么，为什么我想要不鼓励使用 32 位，而升级到 64 位 Linux 呢？

有几个原因，其中一个最大的原因，在本周引发了很多关注。

32 位：古老的电子垃圾硬件？

没错，与其他操作系统不同的是，Linux 发行版允许你重新利用旧硬件。

你能够将一个老机器转换为 媒体服务器、存储服务器，等等。

在这里，我并不是要给你一些如何贡献更多的电子垃圾的思路。尽可能长地利用你的硬件，而不更换它们总是好的。

然而，不使用 32 位系统的理由可能比以往更有说服力。关键的问题是在安全和维护方面。

利用 64 位 Linux 提高安全性

2018 年，危险的处理器安全问题 Spectre 漏洞引发了热议。虽然英特尔和 AMD 对这个漏洞进行了修复，但情况并不乐观。

不幸的是，一个新的漏洞 Retbleed，它是 Spectre 的一个变种，正在影响英特尔和 AMD 芯片。

你可以在下面由发现它的研究人员分享的视频中看到它的情况。




因此，我们自然需要适当的措施来解决这个新的安全漏洞的修复问题。

令人震惊的事情来了。64 位 Linux 内核已经收到了对它的修复，以保护有关的英特尔/AMD 的处理器。但是，正如 Phoronix 所报道的，Linux 32 位内核仍然容易受到 Retbleed 漏洞的影响。

英特尔的 Pawan Gupta 在 内核邮件列表 中回应了这些担忧，他提到：


英特尔不知道还有谁在 Skylake 那一代的 CPU 上使用 32 位模式的生产环境。所以这不应该是一个问题。


另外，很少看到为 32 位维护所做的任何努力。所以，这应该不算什么意外。

因此，如果你使用你的系统进行任何可能受到安全问题影响的任务，你应该避开 32 位内核。

当然，如果你有一个完全离线的环境可以算做例外。所以，你可以这样做，但不建议这样做。

不关心安全问题？

即使你认为得不到像 Retbleed 这样的关键安全修复没有关系，2022 年的 32 位系统也会有更多的麻烦。

软件维护者们最终会放弃对 32 位系统上的工具和 Linux 发行版的更新。

因此，你的 32 位 Linux 系统可能很快就不会再有积极维护的程序了。

因此，现在进行转换（和升级）将是一个好主意。

你还在使用 32 位的 Linux 吗？你对此有什么看法？在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

DeepMind 发布几乎所有已知蛋白质的预测结构

蛋白质由氨基酸链组成，折叠成复杂的形状，这在很大程度上决定了它们的功能。一旦你知道蛋白质是如何折叠的，你就可以开始了解它是如何工作的，以及如何改变它的行为。2020 年 11 月，DeepMind 宣布已开发出一个名为 AlphaFold 的程序，可以使用算法快速预测其结构。去年，DeepMind 发布了 20 个物种的蛋白质结构——包括人类表达的几乎所有 20,000 种蛋白质。现在它已经完成了这项工作，并发布了超过 2 亿种蛋白质的预测结构。基本上，你可以认为它涵盖了整个蛋白质宇宙。

                              <span>最主要的是要精通 JavaScript，这样你就可以减少 ReactJS 之旅的复杂性。


React 是一个建立在 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript 之上的 UI 框架，其中 JavaScript（JS）负责大部分的逻辑。如果你对变量、数据类型、数组函数、回调、作用域、字符串方法、循环和其他 JS DOM 操作相关的主题有一定了解，这些将极大地加快学习 ReactJS 的步伐。

你对现代 JavaScript 的概念将决定你能多快地掌握 ReactJS 的步伐。你不需要成为一个 JavaScript 专家来开始你的 ReactJS 之旅，但就像对食材的了解是任何希望掌握烹饪的厨师所必须的一样，学习 ReactJS 也是如此。它是一个现代的 JavaScript UI 库，所以你需要了解一些 JavaScript。问题是，需要多少？

示例解释

假设我被要求用英语写一篇关于“牛”的文章，但我对这种语言一无所知。在这种情况下，为了让我成功地完成任务，我不仅要对主题有概念，还要对指定的语言有概念。

假设我获得了一些关于主题（牛）的知识，我如何计算我需要知道多少英语才能写出规定的主题？如果我必须用英语写一篇关于其他复杂话题的文章呢？

这很难搞清楚，不是吗？我不知道我要写关于这个话题的什么东西，但它可能是任何东西。所以要想开始，我必须要有适当的英语知识，但还不止于此。

极端现实

在开始使用 ReactJS 之前，所需的 JavaScript 数量也是如此。根据我的例子情景，ReactJS 是话题“牛”，而 JavaScript 是英语。要想在 ReactJS 中获得成功，对 JavaScript 的掌握很重要。如果没有适当的 JavaScript 基础，一个人是很难专业地掌握 ReactJS 的。无论我对这个主题有多少知识，如果我不知道语言的基础，我就不能正确地表达自己。

多少才算够？

根据我的经验，当你开始你的 ReactJS 之旅时，你应该已经熟悉了：


变量

数据类型

字符串方法

循环

条件式


你应该对这些具体的 JavaScript 熟悉。但这些只是最基本的先决条件。当你试图创建一个简单的 React 应用时，你将不可避免地需要处理事件。所以，普通函数、函数表达式、语句、箭头函数的概念，箭头函数和普通函数的区别，以及这两类函数中 this 关键字的词义范围，这确实很重要。

但问题是，如果我必须使用 ReactJS 创建一个复杂的应用怎么办？

获得启发

在 JavaScript 中处理事件、传播操作符、解构、命名导入和默认导入将帮助你理解 React 代码的工作机制。

最重要的是，你必须了解 JavaScript 本身背后的核心概念。JavaScript 在设计上是异步的。当出现在文件底部的代码在文件顶部的代码之前执行时，不要惊讶。像 promise、callback、async-await、map、filter 和 reduce 这样的结构，是 ReactJS 中最常见的方法和概念，尤其是在开发复杂的应用时。

最主要的是要精通 JavaScript，这样你可以减少 ReactJS 之旅的复杂性。

越来越好

我很容易说出你需要知道的东西，但你去学习它完全是另一回事。大量练习 JavaScript 是必不可少的，但你可能会感到惊讶，我认为这并不意味着你必须等到掌握它。有些概念事先很重要，但你可以在学习过程中学到很多东西。练习的一部分是学习，所以你可以开始使用 JavaScript，甚至是 React 的一些基础知识，只要你以舒适的速度移动并理解在你尝试任何严肃的事情之前做你的“家庭作业”是一个要求。

立即开始使用 JavaScript

不要费心等到你了解了 JavaScript 的所有方面。那永远不会发生。如果这样做，你将陷入学习 JavaScript 的永远循环中。你们都知道技术领域是如何不断发展和迅速变化的。如果你想开始学习 JavaScript，请尝试阅读 Mandy Kendall 的介绍性文章 通过编写猜谜游戏学习 JavaScript。这是一种快速入门的好方法，当你看到了可能的情况，我认为你可能会发现很难停下来。

On Friday, Mashable reported that Helium, a crypto project praised by The New York Times earlier this year and whose parent company is backed by investment firms like Andreessen Horowitz, had been misleading people about the companies it works with. Helium advertises on its homepage that Lime, the mobility company behind those electric scooters and bikes, uses its crypto-powered mesh wireless network. The company, however, told Mashable that it hasn’t had a relationship with the company since 2019, and that it had only ever initial testing with Helium’s tech.
Now, Salesforce, whose logo appeared on Helium’s website right next to Lime’s, says that it also doesn’t use the technology. “Helium is not a Salesforce partner,” Salesforce...

A jury in Texas found Charter Communications liable for $7 billion in punitive damages this week as the result of a lawsuit from the family of Betty Jo McClain Thomas, an 83-year-old woman who was stabbed to death by one of its employees in December 2019. The $7 billion is in addition to $375 million in compensatory damages the jury assigned in June. 
The explanation behind the staggering figure of the verdict goes well beyond the horrific crime committed. It also includes the company’s policies and responses to previous incidents of theft and an attempt to forge a document showing Thomas agreed to forced arbitration that would have limited potential damages to the amount of her last bill.

Apple is planning to show ads in the App Store’s Today tab and on individual app pages, according to MacRumors, 9to5Mac, and AppleInsider. The two new ad placements will expand upon the ads you can already see in the App Store’s search tab and in search results.
Ads in the Today tab will appear in the larger card format used by other content in that tab, but you’ll see a small blue box with the word “Ad” inside it under the app’s name. Ads in individual app pages will appear under the “You Might Also Like” header that suggests apps related to the one you’re looking at. Like in App Store search, ads on app pages will be highlighted in blue to distinguish them from other recommendations. According to 9to5Mac, ad buyers won’t be able to...

Handing over your phone — full of photos, texts, and other personal private info — to a repair person can feel dicey. After all, the horrifying reality of having your data leaked during the repair process has actually happened to some people. SamMobile found a press release from Samsung’s Korean press site stating that the company hopes to put an end to that with a new privacy feature called Repair Mode (via Ars Technica). It’ll give technicians a limited amount of access to your phone’s innards. From the sound of it, they’ll be able to access enough to make the fix but not so much to leak your pics.
This feature is coming first to Galaxy S21 phones in South Korea. The company plans to expand support to other models in the future.

Automated birthday emails are a constant of modern life, right up there with death, taxes, and computer updates with poor timing. Once a year, my inbox fills to the brim with reminders of just how many companies I’ve entrusted with my birthdate.
But not this year. No, this year was going to be different. This year I went on a relentless unsubscribing kick, just ruthlessly clicking the unsubscribe button whenever something from a corporate mailing list came into my inbox. But I knew that some things were definitely going to still sneak through.
See, companies can’t resist a birthday. It’s one of the easiest things they can do to get someone’s attention. “​​Birthday emails are one of the most effective emails you can send,” says a blog...

This interactive world map visualizes “a cross-verified database of notable people” to show you the most notable person in your hometown — or anywhere else you might want to look. 
Topi Tjukanov, a geographer and senior map designer at Mapbox, put the visualization together, which features different influential people from fields including culture, science, leadership, and sports. What someone contributes to society to be considered notable can vary, so researchers tried to narrow it down and account for biases where possible.

A good gaming headset is practically a necessity these days. Clean and precise audio is essential for competitive gaming, allowing you not just to pinpoint your enemies but also to communicate effectively with your teammates. Moreover, recent developments in spatial audio and virtual surround sound have allowed headsets to meet — and occasionally surpass — more expensive audio setups, allowing even the most budget-conscious gamer to obtain a competitive edge at a fraction of the price.
While you could always invest in a massive pair of speakers, they’re likely to earn you the dubious distinction of the worst roommate of the decade. Thankfully, the right headset will allow you to keep the running and gunning to yourself, which is why...

If you want to know what frame rates your Steam games are running at, there are many third-party programs out there to help. But if all you need is a very basic counter and you don’t care about other hardware stats, you don’t need to download any of these — you can use a feature that’s built right into Steam. 
Here’s how to set up Steam’s built-in FPS counter for your PC.
I go with the top left, myself.
  

Open Steam.
Go to Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-Game.
Under In-game FPS counter, select the corner where you’d like the counter to appear. You can also check High contrast color if you prefer.
Click Ok. 
Now, go ahead and start your game. You should see the frame rate your game is running at displayed in the corner that you...

Ben Affleck is reprising his role as Batman in the forthcoming Aquaman sequel, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. His return was announced by the film’s star Jason Momoa in an Instagram post, featuring a selfie of the two actors. “Reunited,” Momoa wrote. “bruce and arthur. love u and miss u Ben WB studio tours just explored the backlot alright. busted on set all great things coming AQUAMAN 2 all my aloha j.” 
Alongside the two images, Momoa posted a short video of a Warner Bros. backlot tour apparently discovering Affleck’s involvement in the film. “Well it’s not a fucking secret anymore!” Momoa jokes, before showing the Batman actor in his trailer.

We’re still over a week away from the official launch of Samsung’s latest foldables — the Z Fold 4 and Z Flip 4 — so naturally it’s time for the devices’ designs to leak in full online. 
Leaker Evan Blass has published a bevy of apparently official images over at 91Mobiles, showing the two phones from almost every angle, including in both their folded and unfolded orientations. There appears to be three color options for the Z Fold 4 (black, beige, and gray) and four for the Z Flip 4 (black, gold, blue, and purple). 
If you were hoping for radically different designs for either device compared to last year’s models, though, you’re likely to be disappointed. Both appear to have inherited fundamentally similar looks, right down to camera...

Sony has cut its annual profit outlook, warning of weaker PlayStation game sales. The forecast comes as Sony revealed it shipped 2.4 million PlayStation 5 consoles in its recent quarter, up only 4 percent from the 2.3 million shipped during the same period last year. PS5 lifetime shipments have now reached 21.7 million.
While hardware sales are slightly up year over year, software sales have plummeted 26 percent. In an investor call, Sony blamed the game slump on a lack of big PlayStation titles this year compared to 2021 and less time spent playing games in general — backed up by monthly active PlayStation Network users dropping 3 percent to 102 million. Sony released its exclusive Gran Turismo 7 and Horizon Forbidden West titles...

YouTube is trying to make it even easier for creators to turn their longer videos into Shorts formatted for the platform&#x27;s TikTok competitor, by adding a new “Edit into a Short” tool to its iOS and Android app. It’ll let creators select up to 60 seconds from one of their videos and bring the clip into the Shorts editor, right from the YouTube app on iOS or Android. From there, they can add things like text, filters, as well as additional videos shot with the Shorts camera or pulled from their photo library.
In an announcement post for the feature, YouTube says that the finished Short will link to the full video it was clipped from, which could help make Shorts an ideal promotional tool for the creator’s longer content — a key incentive...

People frequently express their amazement that Twitter is free, but for some people, it isn’t — Twitter Blue launched last year in several countries, tacking on a few extra features for anyone willing to pay $2.99 per month.  Today the service told subscribers it’s increasing the price (via Matt Navara), and in the US, it’s jumping up to $4.99 per month. That probably won’t break the pockets of information addicts who are choosing to pay for a service that still includes advertisements in their feed, but it might be enough to make people ask themselves if it’s worthwhile.
The add-ons in the Twitter Blue package range from extremely useful (an undo tweet window to fix typos, a customizable navigation bar, a list of Top Articles shared by...

160-plus hours into Elden Ring, I’m sure of one thing: the single most annoying thing about my Steam Deck is its whiny fan. And now, I’m so happy to report there’s a way to fix it. It takes roughly 15 minutes and $30 — depending on where you live — to install a replacement fan from iFixit. 
Recently, the repair company finally got a large shipment of those fans, and I bought one right away. Now, my Steam Deck’s tiny screech is gone. 
Here’s how I did it:

As you’ve probably heard, Facebook and Instagram will lean heavily into AI-curated creator content going forward, and the News Tab project Facebook launched a few years ago doesn’t seem to be a big part of that. As reported by Axios and confirming earlier rumors, Facebook’s parent company Meta is telling publishers it no longer plans to pay for the content it has been aggregating in the news tab. 
According to the report, Meta spent about $105 million in three-year content deals for news (plus another $90 million for news videos), including $10 million for the Wall Street Journal, $20 million for the New York Times, and $3 million for CNN in arrangements that sometimes included unlocked access to paywalled content.

痛苦
对你来说，读文献，特别是读自己感兴趣的文献，可能是件非常令人愉悦而激动的事儿。例如海华，他读博的时候我到 UNT 访学，跟他在一个实验室。他时常一边读最新的顶会论文，一边击节赞叹。读到开心之处，他会高声喊出来，还兴奋地把我拉过去一起看。我觉得他是把信息检索读出了《冰与火之歌》的意境。
但是论及阅读海量文献，试图从中找寻自己的研究选题，可能就没有那么轻松愉悦了。原因大家都清楚 —— 论文太多了，而且产生速度极快。即便是水平顶尖的学者，也不敢夸下海口，说自己读过领域内全部重要文献。因为就在你说话这几分钟里，可能又有（不止一篇）新的论文发表了，里面兴许就包括重要的新观点和新发现。这于是就构成了个显著的矛盾：

余生也有涯，而论文无涯。以有涯逐无涯，game over .

可是，不充分全面了解领域的发展，你又怎么寻找和验证自己的选题呢？你兴冲冲地给别人展示自己的新发明，一种有效降低界面摩擦提升运输效率的装置。然后别人一脸狐疑：

这玩意儿，不是叫做轮子吗？

对于科研新手来说，通过研读论文来找寻选题，还担负着必要科研训练的目的。新手在选择「读哪些论文」这个问题上，没有经验，整体过程可能要经历更多挫折和弯路。有的学生不愿意自己耗费无用功，会干脆把这个问题推给导师。

老师老师，您给我布置一个论文阅读列表吧。

如果导师对你的研究方向熟悉，这事儿还好说。可如果不巧你的研究方向是导师尝试进入的新领域，那么这件事儿上他能提供的帮助很有限。这么多的新论文，他也没有都读过来，又怎么去分辨其…</span>

                              <span>自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。
支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴
正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：

Word 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。

PasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。
但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。
假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！
 
更加全面和完善的快捷键体验
作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：

支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；
支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；
「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。

相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。
iOS 版本的变化
三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。
首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。
另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。
以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。
当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。
小结
PasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。
希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～

PostgreSQL has become the preferred open source relational database for many enterprise developers and start-ups, powering leading business and mobile applications. Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL deployments in the cloud.

However, according to research in the subject, the average (human) software developer can produce between 325 and 750 lines of code per month. If I have a really fast computer, I can make Magic produce 1,000,000 lines of code per second. If you calculate the ratio here, you&#x27;ll see that Magic is 234,000,000,000 times faster than a human being.
Time is interesting. As we reduced the required time needed to assemble books, we reduced the cost of books 1 million times. As a consequence, the number of books exploded, and we entered the era of enlightenment as a consequence. In fact, the modern era is nothing but the &quot;bastard child of Gutenberg&quot;.

                              <span>In CSS, the transition property is used to specify adding transition effects to one or more CSS properties.
The most common usage is to add a transition to an element, so that when one of its properties changes from state A to state B, it is no longer very direct and obtrusive, but with a tween animation.
For example:


div {
    width: 140px;
    height: 64px;
    transition: .8s transform linear;
}
div:hover {
    transform: translate(120px, 0);
}


Of course, in addition to the above basic usage, there are actually some very interesting details and interesting usages of CSS transition. Let me explain them one by one.
Not all properties support transitions. Similar to animation, here is a list of all properties that support transitions -- CSS animated properties

Live streaming technology allows you to broadcast, watch, create and share videos in real-time. All you need to be able to live stream is an internet-enabled device, like a smartphone or tablet, and a platform (such as a website or app) to live stream.
Live streaming apps are rapidly developing, given this trend&#x27;s tremendous opportunities in many fields. Depending on the domain, the basic requirements for building a live streaming app differ as follows:
Game live streaming app - The picture must be clear and smooth to construct a game live streaming app.
Entertainment live streaming app - Building an entertainment app requires various interactive functions such as gifts, barrage, and mini-games.

                              <span>Structured Query Language (SQL) databases are the go to solution for most small projects and products. They provide a high performance way to query relational data across many different axis.

However, SQL databases have problems scaling which is why most companies eventually find themselves moving off SQL solutions and onto NoSQL alternatives. So why don&#x27;t SQL databases scale?
SQL databases rely on structured data and foreign keys to connect data. This is an extremely performant way to manage data and lets you link data across the whole database with simple queries using SELECT and JOIN.
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID&#x3D;Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

We have to mimic the cylinder because we don&#x27;t have a CSS native box for round objects.

The result for today will be this excellent-looking cylinder shape.

使用表现：
用着的时候 iPad 上的状态栏突然一灰，然后鼠标就划不过去了，mba 上确实划出去了，但是不知道去了哪里，点击也没反应，触摸板手势只影响 mba ，iPad 上没反应，有时再往 iPad 上划的时候就触发通用控制退出屏幕共享了。
还遇到了把 iPad 屏幕设置在了左边，自动变到右边了的情况
目前把通用控制关了，准备测试一下效果

具体情况如下：
光猫有 IPv4 和 v6 地址。v4 显然是内网地址。
然后 ER-X 直连光猫，后面带几个无线路由形成几个不同的子网
目前我的想法是，不通过 ER-X 拨号，只折腾内网，是否有可能通过 NAT6 之类的东西
使得内网服务或者机器能通过 IPv6 访问到。

不想等退货流程走完返换教育优惠名额再买，现在想直接用同学的 unidays 验证在我的 Apple ID 上继续购买一台，不知道可行与否？
如果不可，教育优惠购买的 Apple Care+送修时需要的是收货人、Apple ID 号主、学生身份的哪一个验证？还是只要有 AC+凭证和电子发票就可以了？
先提前感谢回答 🙏</span>

到手后很快发现打电话的时候扬声器杂音，破音，于是我预约了南京某直营店去做检测。
接待的小哥态度不错，复现了故障，说要返厂检测，我表示同意，并要求把修好的手表寄给我。
7 天后，收到一个新表头，故障解除，保修延长到明年 7 月。这个比较意外。</span>

rename 命令如何以目录名字为前缀 批量重命名其中文件
目录 A 下有几百个目录 1 2 3 4 5 6...300
该 300 个目录下分别有文件若干不等。并且文件名是一样的，比如 name001.mp4,name002.mp4...name099.mp4
rename &#x27;s/oldname/newname/&#x27; *.mp4
这样可以每个文件夹分别操作替换，不过需要操作 300 次。

1 目录中的变成 1name001 ，1name001...
2 目录中的变成 2name001 ，2name002...</span>

昨晚上折腾电脑, 把 ESP 分区搞没了. 结果就重装电脑.
我 dotfile 存在 Github, GPG SSH 等密钥在 OneDrive, 代码在远程, IDE 的设置都是通过 JB Account 同步.
重装好之后在设置里打开了 开发者选项 &gt; 设置代理(从 PE 拷出来的 clash) &gt;安装 scoop &gt;  添加Bucket  &gt; scoop install xxx 就好了, 再登陆一下各种账户 就和重装之前的电脑一样了!
Bucket使用的是 https://github.com/kkzzhizhou/scoop-apps
,
成功的有: zulu8, zulu11, zulu17,Maven, Golang1.18.4, Python3.10, Chrome, aria2, 7z, JetBrains ToolBox, Git, cURL, Notion Enhanced,Nmap, Netcat, WeChat, 更纱黑体,JetBrains Mono
失败的有: Gpg4Win, WireGuard (都是因为需要管理员权限)
找不到包的有: QQ, QQMusic,Logi Options+
总结: scoop 真香

In my previous article about rustup, I showed you how to install the Rust toolchain. Well, what good is the toolchain if you won’t be using it to get more hands-on with Rust? Learning any language involves reading existing code and writing a lot of sample programs. That&#x27;s a good way to become proficient in a language. However, there&#x27;s a third way: debugging code.
Learning through debugging involves trying to compile a pre-written (buggy) sample program, understanding the errors generated by the compiler, fixing the sample code, and then re-compiling it. Repeat that process until the code successfully compiles and runs.

No one wants to write bad code, but inevitably bugs will be created. Most modern languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, etc., automatically print a stack trace when they encounter an unhandled exception, but not shell scripts. It would make it much easier to find and fix bugs in shell scripts if you could print a stack trace, and, with a little work, you can.
Shell scripts can span multiple files, and well-written code is further broken down into functions. Tracing issues when something goes wrong in a shell script can be difficult when these scripts get large enough. A stack trace that walks the code backward from the error to the begin…</span>

0. 前言
之前写过一篇 《[-NDK 导引篇 -] 在NDK开发之前你应知道的东西》 介绍了在进入 NDK 学习之前，如何摆正自己的角色。时隔两年，NDK 系列文章开始填坑，在上一篇 《 NDK 是什么 | FFmpeg 5.0 编译 so 库》 中，介绍了 NDK 的概念，以及其作用。
正所谓，工欲善其事必先利其器，接下来将用 2~3 篇来系统介绍一下 CMake 及 CMakeLists.txt 的语法。CMake 这块知识是比较独立的，不止是 Android NDK 项目，一般的 C++ 项目也可以通过 CMake 进行构建。为了更具有一般性，将在 Linux 环境中，通过 C++ 项目来介绍 CMake 的相关知识，当然这一切也可以用于 Android NDK 项目中。
CMake 本质上是一个 编译工具，其最终目的是方便地生成可执行文件或共享库。编译的过程和项目的配置，由 CMakeLists.txt 文件负责定义。这很像 gradle 构建工具和 build.gradle 文件之间的关系，前者是可执行文件，后者是配置定义。
既然 cmake 是一个工具，在使用它之前，首先要拥有它。一般 linux 环境都会有 CMake , 如果是 Windows 环境，在官网下载 即可。在终端输入如下命令，可以查看版本号，有输出表示环境正常：
---&gt; cmake --version
cmake version 3.16.3

前言
今天我们继续探索绘制与手势的组合的实践，不知道掘金的朋友有没有喜欢下围棋的，其实下棋也是绘制和手势结合的一个典型的实际应用，毕竟棋盘肯定是需要我们自定义绘制出来的，那么今天我们就用Flutter来继续绘制一个标准的围棋棋盘吧。
绘制
绘制之前，我们先了解下，围棋棋盘和棋子以及规则，在我们下棋时，每落下一颗棋子，棋盘是固定不变的，变化的只是棋盘上的棋子，那么在下棋刷新画布时，我们只需刷新棋盘上的棋子即可，棋子落子生根，落下不可随意走动，那么在手势中处理中我们只需处理点击事件即可，没有移动以及其他事件处理，Ok，有了这个思路，接下来我们开始绘制。
棋盘
第一步，画棋盘，围棋中，目前主流的游戏规则有9、13、19路三种棋盘，9路适合新手入门，而19路则是围棋发展至今的标准的围棋棋盘，也是各种比赛默认的围棋棋盘。
题外话：虽然只是19 * 19路的棋盘，但是就在这小小的围棋棋盘上可出现的变化绝对是一个无法想象的天文数字，以至于围棋发展了2000多年，古今棋局至今没有完全相同的一局棋，正所谓千古无同局说的就是围棋，这也是人类对围棋为之着迷的原因，正是这样的原因，人类相较于电脑一直统治着围棋游戏水平的天花板，直至2016年Google研发的Alphago问世之后，首次与当时人类顶尖棋手李世石的对局中，以4-1战绩横扫人类，人类统治围棋的神话也随之崩塌了，而赢的那一局也成为了目前为止人类战胜Alphago的唯一的一局棋，之后Alphago横扫围棋棋坛，对战人类再无败绩，也侧面说明了人类对于围棋当中无穷奥秘的掌握首次被人工智能超越，之后人类不服，约Alphago在17年与当时世界冠军柯洁进行的三番局对弈，结果Alphago以3-0完胜柯洁，随之Google宣布，Alphago将永久退出围棋届所有比赛，并将源代码开源…</span>

                              <span>Debian 会考虑在官方版本中添加非自由固件吗？如果他们想解决 Debian 开发人员重点提出的问题，这似乎是一种可能性。




由于 Debian 的稳定性和新功能之间的平衡，它是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。

此外，它不附带任何非自由固件。

但是，对于想要在较新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已成为一个问题。

大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件才能正常工作，其中包括 Wi-Fi、图形等。

为了解决这个问题，Debian 开发人员、前 Debian 项目负责人 Steve McIntyre 已经积极讨论了一段时间。

正如 Geeker&#x27;s Digest 所发现的，在 DebConf 22 会议上，Steve 最近向用户和开发人员着重谈到了修复固件混乱这件事。

在官方版本中包含非免费固件

至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的非官方 Debian 镜像。

然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”也不是用户更喜欢推荐的镜像的东西。

此外，当用户可以选择 Ubuntu 或任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版作为替代方案时，期望用户安装非自由固件也是违反直觉的。

不仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：


维护单独的非自由镜像非常耗时。

由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。


如果我们希望更多用户在通用硬件上使用 Debian，Steve 建议尽早解决这个问题。

可能会通过安装程序中的提示让用户安装非自由固件，类似于 Ubuntu 所做的。

此外，在他在 DebConf 22 的演讲中，似乎大多数开发人员投票支持在官方 Debian 镜像中添加非自由固件。

随着他重点提出这件事，Steve 得到了寻找解决这个问题的社区用户/开发人员的更多关注。

简单/方便的出路：在官方发布的镜像中添加非自由固件。

那么，Debian 最终会在其新版本中添加对非自由固件的支持吗？ Debian 12 会让这成为现实吗？

在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

据一家国外网站不完全统计，预计到明年 3 月（按照谷歌的预告），谷歌画上句号的硬件产品有 267 款。其中包括 Nexus 手机（2012-2015）、谷歌眼镜（2012-2015）、谷歌 Cardboard VR 纸盒（2014-2019）等等。

漏洞披露 15 分钟后黑客就开始扫描

最近发布的一份事故响应报告称，黑客一直在监视安全公司的新漏洞披露报告，通常在 CVE 公布 15 分钟后就开始扫描漏洞，在数小时内就能观察到首次漏洞利用尝试。以 2022 年 5 月 4 日披露的 F5 BIG-IP 远程执行漏洞 CVE-2022-1388 为例，在 CVE 公布 10 小时内就记录到了 2552 次扫描和漏洞利用尝试。据该报告，2022 年上半年利用最多的漏洞是 ProxyShell 占 55%，其次是 Log4Shell 占 14%，SonicWall 7%，ProxyLogon 5%。

                              <span>在 Ubuntu 中使用 Docker Compose 安装 Docker 引擎的分步指导。


在这篇文章中，我们将会明白 Docker 是什么，如何 在 Ubuntu 中安装 Docker 引擎 。此外，我们也将会明白如何 安装 Docker Compose ，它是一个定义并运行多容器的 Docker 应用。

我们已经在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 中正式的测试了这份指南。然而，它也应该对旧版本如 20.04 LTS 和 18.04 LTS 有效。为了更好的安全性和稳定性，我推荐你使用最新的版本 —— Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 。

什么是 Docker ？

Docker 是一个快捷、轻便的系统级虚拟化技术，开发者和系统管理员可以使用它构建具备所有必要依赖项的应用程序，并将其作为一个包发布。

Docker 与其他如 VMWare 、Xen 、以及 VirtualBox 等工具的虚拟化方式不同，每个虚拟机不需要单独的客户操作系统。

所有的 Docker 容器有效地共享同一个主机系统内核。每个容器都在同一个操作系统中的隔离用户空间中运行。

Docker 容器可以在任何 Linux 版本上运行。比如说你使用 Fedora ，我用 Ubuntu 。我们能相互开发、共享并分发 Docker 镜像。

你无需担心操作系统、软件以及自定义设置，任何事都不用担心。只要我们的主机安装了 Docker ，就能持续开发。简言之，Docker 能够在任何地方运行！

前文中你读到了两个词：Docker 镜像 和 Docker 容器 ，或许你在想它们的区别。

通俗地说，Docker 镜像是一个描述容器应该如何表现的文件，而 Docker 容器是 Docker 镜像的运行（或停止）状态。

希望你能够理解 Docker 的基础概念。更多细节，你可以…</span>

Blizzard is facing another walkout of sorts; this time, it’s players in the regional Overwatch Contenders tournament. After a competitive ruling ended a match prematurely, players in the  European Overwatch Contenders Summer Series tournament refused to play.
In the off-week of the Overwatch League as teams rest up from the beautiful chaos of the Midseason Madness tournament last week, Blizzard ran an Overwatch Contenders tournament to fill the time. Just like Midseason Madness, the Overwatch Contenders Summer Series is a double-elimination tournament with a winner’s bracket and a loser’s bracket. Today’s European winner’s bracket final — the game that would determine which team would go on to the grand final and which team would fall to...

Apple narrowly outperformed Wall Street expectations with its Q3 earnings on Thursday afternoon, reporting a slight year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue and a 12 percent jump for its services division. But elsewhere, the company’s numbers sagged: Mac revenues were down by 10 percent — a drop that CEO Tim Cook attributed to supply chain constraints and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. But it also matches an industry-wide trend of PC sales being on the decline. 
Earlier this month, Apple released a redesigned MacBook Air powered by the company’s M2 chip — but that didn’t factor into this quarter’s results. The new Air followed the launch of the upgraded 13-inch MacBook Pro in June. The Mac Studio desktop, Studio Display, M1-powered...

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a biopic about the musician starring Daniel Radcliffe, will release on November 4th on The Roku Channel, the streaming company has announced. The film will be available to stream everywhere where Roku’s free service is available, and is the latest step in the company’s push into producing original content that reportedly includes as many as 50 shows. 
The biopic covers the life of musician Weird Al Yankovic including his “rise to fame in the music industry to his celebrity love affairs” according to Roku. It’s being directed by Eric Appel (who most recently directed all ten episodes of Quibi show Die Hart) and is written by Appel and Weird Al himself.

Ford, the leading automaker when it comes to making and selling specially designed vehicles for law enforcement, revealed the F-150 Lightning Pro SSV, an electric truck specially designed for law enforcement. 
The truck is a variant of the F-150 Lightning Pro, which is a version of Ford’s electric pickup that’s aimed specifically at commercial customers and fleet owners. Ford is pitching the F-150 Lightning Pro SSV (which stands for “Special Service Vehicle”) as an ideal fleet vehicle with all the features cops have come to rely on over the years, as well as other advantages specific to EVs, like quick acceleration and a lower total cost of ownership.

Snap has launched its first in-Snapchat augmented reality game, a spooky “found phone” title called Ghost Phone. In the game, you’ll work to solve the mystery of what happened to the previous owner of a smartphone, and you’ll quickly learn that things are just a little bit... ghastly. 
The core of the game is using the camera on your actual smartphone to find AR ghosts that appear in your nearby surroundings. You’ll complete different types of activities to find and capture the ghosts — for one, I had to track three floating energy balls around my office to make a ghost appear. As you capture more ghosts, you’ll unlock additional things you can check out the “phone,” such as new text messages and more apps.


Ghost Phone is Snap’s take on...

Sony is starting to test 1440p resolution support for its PlayStation 5 console, a highly-requested addition. Testers will get access to a new PS5 system software beta today that includes 1440p support, curated gamelists for their library, and new social features.
The new 1440p video output option will allow PS5 owners to choose this resolution on compatible TVs and monitors. If games support 1440p then native 1440p output will be supported, but otherwise 4K games will benefit from improve anti-aliasing by supersampling down to the 1440p output.

A new Status feature has started appearing for some Twitter users that lets them assign one of several pre-written labels to their tweets. A spokesperson for the company confirmed the limited test in a statement given to TechCrunch, while Twitter users have been sharing screenshots of the feature in action. 
“For a limited time, we are testing a feature that allows you to add a status topic from a predetermined list to your Tweets to provide more context for your followers,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “So whether you are about to drop a hot Tweet thread, share your shower thoughts, or have a bad case of the Mondays, your Tweets can better convey what you are up to.”

Over two dozen Amazon workers claim the company didn’t respond appropriately to racist death threats against Black workers at its MDW2 facility in Joliet, Illinois, and retaliated against an employee who spoke out, according to a report from the Chicago Tribune (via Engadget). The 26 workers have reportedly filed complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). 
In late May, workers said they found messages reading “[n-word]s gonna die” and “fuck these [n-words] at MDW2” written on bathroom walls in the facility, according to the advocacy group Warehouse Workers for Justice. A day or two later, according to a report from local outlet Herald-News, employees learned that someone anonymously called the facility with...

Google is finally bringing an old feature to its new Nest cameras. Starting this week, you can stream the video feed from all your Nest cameras and video doorbells to your TV using a Chromecast with Google TV. Google announced the feature in a blog post on the Google Nest Community forum Wednesday morning. 
“What?” You ask. “Couldn’t you already do this?” Well, yes and no. It was possible to view the video feed from older Nest cameras — such as the Google Nest Doorbell (wired), the now discontinued Nest Cams, and the camera inside the Nest Hub Max — on the biggest screen in your home. 
But, as I noted in my review of the new Nest Cam (indoor, wired), none of Google’s newer cameras could stream to Chromecast devices. (All Nest cameras can...

If you already have strong feelings about your Instagram feed increasingly showing Reels from accounts you don’t follow, just wait until next year.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will more than double the amount of content from recommended accounts people see while using Instagram and Facebook by the end of 2023. He said that such recommendations currently account for roughly 15 percent of the content on Facebook, and that the percentage is already higher on Instagram.
The push, which Zuckerberg calls building the “Discovery Engine,” is a radical departure from Facebook and Instagram’s historical focus on showing posts from a user’s social graph, or list of friends. The shift is intended to compete with TikTok’s heavy use of...

                              <span>val 跟 var
val本意就是一个不可变的变量，即赋初始值后不可改变，想较于val，var其实就简单的多，就是可变变量。为什么说val是不可变的变量呢？这不就是矛盾了嘛，其实不矛盾，我们在字节码的角度出发，比如有
val a  &#x3D; Test()
var b &#x3D; Test()

变成的字节码是
  private final Lcom/example/newtestproject/Test; a

  private Lcom/example/newtestproject/Test; b

其实val 本质就是用final修饰的变量罢了，而var，就是一个很普通的变量。两者默认都赋予private作用域，这个其实是kotlin世界赋予的额外操作，并不影响我们的理解。从这里出发，我们再继续深入进去！
一个有趣的实验
companion object{
    val c &#x3D; Test()
    const val d &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
    const val e &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
    val r &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
    val v &#x3D; d
}

如果我们把val变量放在companion object里面，这个时候就会被赋予静态的特性，我们看下上面这段代码生成后的字节码

  private final static Lcom/example/newtestproject/Test; c


  public final static Ljava/lang/String; d &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;

 
  public final static Ljava/lang/String; e &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;


  private final static Ljava/lang/String; r

 
  private final static Ljava/lang/String; v

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · Android-NoteBook 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 带你建立核心竞争力。
前言
在 Android 生态中主要有 C/C++、Java、Kotlin 三种语言 ，它们的关系不是替换而是互补。其中，C/C++ 的语境是算法和高性能，Java 的语境是平台无关和内存管理，而 Kotlin 则融合了多种语言中的优秀特性，带来了一种更现代化的编程方式；
JNI 是实现 Java 代码与 C/C++ 代码交互的特性， 思考一个问题 —— Java 虚拟机是如何实现两种毫不相干的语言的交互的呢？ 今天，我们来全面总结 JNI 开发知识框架，为 NDK 开发打下基础。本文部分演示代码可以从 DemoHall·HelloJni 下载查看。

                              <span>In this blog will go over three approaches of centering a div.



The most difficult thing a web developer will ever have to accomplish is use CSS to center a div both horizontally and vertically.
Classic approach
Flexbox approach

.myDiv {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}


.flex {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}


.grid {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
}

                              <span>At some point, when engineers reach a level of seniority, they become curious about management. I am convinced that every individual contributor arrives at the point of getting larger-than-oneself ideas and wanting to use the insight they accumulated through technical work to lead teams. 
For years, management seemed a logical next step for a developer’s career, up to the point of a strongly-held belief that getting a manager’s title is a “promotion”. Only after having made an engineer-manager transition myself, I am confident this is false.
When you are a manager, you stop being an active contributor or have to cut your workload and give up challenging tasks. Over time, you might discover your coding skills have deteriorated and realize you are behind on tech trends and best practices.

Fixed issue with destroyed containers, fixes #4385, fixes #4413, fixes #4534
Fixed issue with opacity and svg color replaced images, fixes #4532
Yesterday, I have also announced that React and Vue.js packages are changing names. This is something important because the old packages could become obsolete in the next months, it depends on how many work I need to maintain 6 packages instead of 3.

Python is mostly chosen for developing web apps because of its many additional libraries, helpful frameworks, and simplicity.
Let’s look closer at one of the fastest Python web frameworks available. Combining Python and FastAPI leads to amazing results and chances to develop fast websites. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performant), web framework with built-in support for async endpoints for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python-type hints.

Test coverage enables testers to identify gaps at early stages, get better coverage and to remove redundant cases. It basically saves 𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎 and 𝚖𝚘𝚗𝚎𝚢.

Instruction coverage does not imply test point coverage.

Up until now we discussed tools that are very low level. Some can be used to debug system level services. Today we’ll discuss the other side of the stack but still a very advanced management tool. To understand this you need to understand the field we’re in.
As developers we deal with code and applications. Deployment is for OPS/DevOps and the tooling they use is often alien to us. It’s not that they have bad tools. On the contrary, they have amazing tools. But they’re usually designed for massive scale. When you need to manage thousands of servers you need a way to control things in all of them.

                              <span>Hello!
So this is my first article here and wanted to show you how I created a simple but amazing animated 3D Bar Chart with dynamically colored bars based on their height.

The chart is rendered using NodeJS, Visual Studio Code, and LightningChart JS&#x27; BoxSeries3D, a series type capable of rendering any number of Boxes as well as allowing single full-level modifications (location, size, color) at any point during the runtime.
The example also shows how to use the rounded edges feature. This is a characteristic of this chart that is active by default but can also be disabled (if you use BoxSeries3D.setRoundedEdges).
Ideally, you would download the project to follow this article. The file is a RAR and you can get it from here:

Endpoints are the end path of a resource URL and usually have brief descriptions. Also, an endpoint shows how you can access specific information from a resource, not the base path shared by all endpoints.
This is a common mistake people make most times, identifying an endpoint as URL is wrong. URL is a base path to the resource API, it can be associated with any HTTP method.
An API URL Path is an address that allows you to access an API and its various features. It is the base address for a specific API that you’re using. Until you choose a…</span>

之前在某个很诡异的需求情况下，为了练手而练手就实现了一个，项目中有教程说明是怎么实现的，也是看别人的文章做的。
前天因为有一台 Windows Server 改了默认的 3389 ，交接的问题也没说新的是啥，然后也懒得去找注册表了，就想起了有这个项目，改造了下，实现了多线程、多地址段、多端口的特定协议的端口扫描。当然顺利找到了（大力出奇迹）。做的时候仅仅是快出活，没有特别考虑扫描效率问题，毕竟我一般也没得这种诡异的需求，仅仅是做都做了，不如···再···而已。
PS: 之前都是用 naabu ，仅仅支持端口扫描，但是不能针对协议扫描。
现在本项目提供了，可执行程序共大家使用，也可以应用 pkg 里面提供的方法到自己项目中玩。如果你的平台没有，嗯···如果你能自己加 goreleaser 脚本的代码贡献下就更好，这一块我一般都是比较脑壳疼的。
协议特征匹配的部分后续也许会根据新增的协议再重构，现在看起来是不太“爽”的哈</span>

一连换了好几个电池，鼠标都不亮，我以为鼠标坏了
想一想也用挺久了，鼠标也不贵，几十块买的，坏了倒也合理，随手就给扔了
迫于任务紧急，没有鼠标干活效率低，于是立刻在京东下单买了个新鼠标，下午三点就送到了
然而感觉新鼠标不太好用，所以隔了几天又把家里的鼠标换过来用
家里的鼠标电池用了很久了，也不知道还有多少电量，
我心想提前换一下新电池吧，然后就把前几天拿的那几节电池换一下，结果鼠标也都不亮
我突然意识到，原来我的旧鼠标没有坏，是我拿的这几节电池都没有电了

这个让 ZFS 工作在 Windows 上的项目还不太稳定，经常蓝屏，便寻求其他解决方案，于是乎。
有人可能会说你在不是脱裤子放屁吗，这不就是装个虚拟机运行 Linux ？？？
是的，我就是脱裤子放屁。
写这个文章的时候使用的是 ArchLinux 的 WSL2 ，为了使教程更简单，也为了从 0 实现，这篇文章使用 Ubuntu22.04 版本进行测试。
先决条件
安装 WSL2 版本的 Ubuntu22.04 ，其他的系统版本应当也可。
具体安装方法参考官方文档。
对于系统版本大于 Windows 10 version 2004 或者 Windows11 的用户参考下面的文档：
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
对于系统版本大于 Version 1903 的参考下面的文档：
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual
替换 WSL 的 Linux Kernel
参考文档^1
在此 https://github.com/oldshensheep/zfs-on-wsl/releases 下载编译好的支持 ZFS 的 Kernel ，需要下载 bzImage ，放到 Windows 的一个地方。
然后在 PowerShell 窗口中执行以下命令：
注意把替换成你下载的 bzImage 的路径，例如C:\\Fun\\bzImage
&quot;
[wsl2]
kernel&#x3D;
&quot; &gt; ~/.wslconfig

然后wsl --shutdown关闭运行中的实例，然后重新启动 Ubuntu 。
挂载硬盘到 WSL2
参考文档^2
其实系统现在已经支持 ZFS 了，…</span>

                              <span>liuser666: Linux 不是有很多软件吗？它们的配置文件往往分布在各种各样的地方。
同时它们还喜欢在用户目录里拉屎，我每次看到一堆.git .zshrc .....都贼烦。

我想弄一个命令行小工具，有一个思路：
在原本的路径下创建软链接，然后在一个统一的目录下把这些配置文件放好，这样我下次改配置文件的时候就不用到各种目录下找了。同时基于目前的云同步软件还能达成换电脑一键分发配置。
但是还是解决不了拉屎的问题，不知道各位有没有什么看法。

另外现在工程项目里一堆.install .esdoc.json .....docker eslint 看得我好难受，有没有什么好办法？</span>

公司有个设备,只提供了一个用 python 改的 shell.没有任何其他的接口,现在有些也要需要通过命令行即时的交互计算,然后找了好久没找到通过程序来控制这些的方法..最后想到了用 tmux 先绕过去
1.开一个 tmux 的 session,在里面打开 shell
tmux new-session -s development
2.通过 tmux send-keys 发命令,比如
tmux send-keys -t development &#x27;python&#x27; C-m
3.通过 tmux capture-pane 获取 session 里的屏幕输出
tmux capture-pane -t development -p -S -100 -E-
这样输入输出就都有了,勉强可以凑合着用了</span>

然后有一天，买东西时随口问了一下店主，他们的门店租金是多少钱，答：“3 万一年，上下两层”，我就觉得有点惊讶，这里门店大概宽 3.5 - 4 米，深有 10 米以上，不算大，但两层加起来，也不算小了。
如果能租一个门店，简单装修成类阅览室，对外开放，给人提供一个可以歇脚讨论或工作学习的地方，采用会员订阅制，一个月不多 30 元（?），能否做到收支平衡或实现盈利呢？
当然这个方案还有很多不完善的地方，但总体思路如此，欢迎一起来讨论。
PS: 如果你的楼下有这样一个地方，你会去看看吗？</span>

个人对“失效”的定义：迭代器，指针或者引用所指向元素的内存地址位置发生变化。

根据这个理解，vector 和 string 的插入和删除操作的描述我能看懂。
deque 插入元素到头尾不影响指针和引用我也能理解，但是 deque 是向两边增长的，迭代器指向的元素原地址也不变，怎么说会失效呢？个人感觉应该是针对头尾迭代器的作用去说的，同理 deque 删除首尾元素。
list 插入和删除目标只要不是迭代器，引用，指针指向的元素本身，那应该有效。
所以说 deque 这段是怎么一回事？</span>

                              <span>meloyang05: 这个问题已经困扰我很久了，在网上搜索了很久也没有很好的解决办法。各系统均为最新正式版本（ 15.6/12.5 ）
该问题仅仅出现在各系统向 macOS 进行 AirDrop 的时候（包括 macOS 间互传），系统会卡“等待中”非常久。运气好的时候 5 6 秒能够结束等待中进入文件传输阶段，有的时候甚至 30s 1min 过去了还提示等待中。。。
非常奇怪的是，从 macOS 端往 iOS/iPadOS 端传输，以及 iOS/iPadOS 之间互传完全没有任何问题，基本 1 秒之内就能完成“等待中”并进入文件传输阶段
个人初步怀疑是 macOS 之间的 Uiversal Control 影响了 macOS 建立 AirDrop 握手的信道。我个人手上是两台 macbook 同时通过 universal control 使用，设备为 19 款 16 寸 pro 以及 m1 air 。但是我并不能够确定是这个原因，因为我将其中一台带回家，一台留在公司时，AirDrop 的使用仍然会出现上述问题
能不能麻烦大家看看自己手上的设备有没有这样的问题呢？</span>

今天用 Qt(做跨平台桌面 UI 的一个大而臃肿的库，自带一个 IDE 工具)编译一个项目，它的 IDE 允许自定义一些编译的前置步骤，所以我想在编译前，拷贝一些库文件到指定的目录。我观察到了它自带的步骤里面有用到%{buildDir}这样的环境变量，于是很自然的我想知道库文件的目录应该用什么环境变量来表示。
可我找不到一点提示的线索。上网搜索一番，发现不止我有这个疑问： https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35970727/use-of-variables-like-builddir-in-qtcreator-kit-settings-in-qt5
我很郁闷，为什么这个 IDE 的开发者，就认为我一定会知道他所设置的「变态的」环境变量名称是什么呢？
不止 Qt 有这个问题，包括 VisualStudio 在内，很多 IDE 都是这样的。可是做一个提示很难吗？ ContextMenu 这个思路就很好啊，右键点击一下，我就知道了我在这里可以做什么操作。那我在自定义前置步骤的时候，肯定会用到环境变量啊，为什么不能在旁边给一个提示按钮，让我可以浏览可能的环境变量呢？
相似的例子，还有编译器不知所云让人抓狂的报错！
相似的例子，还有 web 端的各种脚手架工具！
相似的例子，还有。。。留给大家举例吧。
对比之下，今天我还用到了一个命令：git rebase --interactive 。它虽然是命令行形式的，可它的文本提示写的很清楚，pick 、squash 、fixup...分别代表什么，直接在你要作修改的地方列出来了。带 GUI 的连这个也比不过，说不过去。
虽说这些都是给程序员用的工具，但————
一个程序员首先是一个人！！！

多年没有用 win ，新公司只能用 win 办公。
目前对于 win 下的杀毒 /清理软件，还处于 360/鲁大师全家桶的年代。
就是一安装就会捆绑安装很多软件，然后又吃内存，又不好卸载。
本打算不安装类似软件，但是感觉总是会产生一些缓存，垃圾文件等。
在 macos 下有一个腾讯柠檬清理软件挺好用，但遗憾没有 Windows 平台的。
真心求一个功能简单的电脑清理软件，不要有很多没用的加速 /检测等功能。</span>

不知道为什么很多即时通讯 app 都是这样设计的，qq 、微信、tg 等，只要程序挂了后台，不管前台打不打开界面，docker 栏的 recent app 总是会常驻这些图标。。很郁闷，但明明有的 app 是可以挂在后台同时不常住图标的，比如 docker （ docker.com 的 docker ）</span>

Unix has always excelled at processing text, and Linux is no different. And the tools to work with and transform text files still exist on all Linux systems.
Like other computer systems, early Unix printed on paper, using a typewriter-style printing device. These printers provided limited formatting options, but with clever application of Unix tools, you could prepare professional-looking documents.
One such tool was the pr tool, to prepare text documents for printing. Let&#x27;s explore how to use standard Unix tools, such as the pr processor and the fmt text formatter, to prepare text files for printing on a typewriter-style printer.

Xbox has released a clothing and accessory collection dedicated to camping. No, not the video game kind that esports organization 100 Thieves lambasted with its own clothing line — Microsoft’s is about actually getting outside and touching grass. The camper collection includes a variety of shorts, shirts, and headgear, along with things like a hammock and camping chair. 
Given that most people don’t usually associate gaming with going outdoors, some of the items in the lineup actually seem decent. Xbox’s camp chair looks like a clone of the design popularized by the Helinox Chair Zero (to be fair, so does pretty much every other camp chair), but electric green and twice as heavy. Given that it’s significantly cheaper than the Helinox,...

Last week, the UK reached its highest temperature on record — 40 degrees Celsius, or more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit. On July 20th, as the record-breaking “Red Extreme” heatwave continued to linger, a Bloomberg op-ed reports officials made the decision to pay a record price of £9,724.54 (about $11,685) per megawatt to ensure electricity for South London residents — about 5,000 percent higher than its usual average price of £178 per megawatt hour. 
To avoid an energy short squeeze in 2021, the UK paid about £1,600 (more than $1,900) per megawatt to import energy. 
Yesterday #gas produced 43.0% of British electricity, more than wind 23.5%, nuclear 15.1%, biomass 7.2%, solar 6.0%, imports 3.8%, coal 0.8%, hydro 0.7%, other 0.0% *excl....

Spotify’s number of premium subscribers rose to 188 million in its second quarter, while its monthly active users (MAU) now sit at 433 million, the company announced in an earnings release today. That’s a year-over-year increase of 14 percent and 19 percent respectively, and compares to the 182 million and 422 million figures it announced last quarter. The company says its growth in MAUs was its largest ever in a second quarter, and exceeded its guidance.
The earnings come at the end of a quarter in which Spotify’s big push into podcasts has experienced some hiccups. One of its biggest podcasts, Reply All, broadcast its final episode on June 23rd after co-hosts Alex Goldman and Emmanuel Dzotsi decided to leave production company Gimlet....

Roland Emmerich, the director behind disaster movies such as Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and Moonfall, is making a “gladiatorial epic” series for NBCUniversal’s streaming service Peacock. The show, which will be titled Those About to Die, is based on the book of the same name by Daniel Mannix (which, incidentally, previously served as the inspiration for Ridley Scott’s Gladiator). The series is set to be written by Robert Rodat, whose previous work includes Saving Private Ryan.
Those About to Die is the first TV show created by Emmerich. Although he previously directed 2012 TV movie Dark Horse, the director’s career has otherwise been focused on the big screen, with a filmography packed with summer blockbusters. It sounds...

AMD accidentally leaked its Noise Suppression feature last week, and now it’s officially making it available as part of its Adrenalin software. The latest Adrenalin Edition 22.7.1 update includes AMD Noise Suppression, which will reduce background audio noise using a real-time deep learning algorithm.
AMD Noise Suppression works very similarly to RTX Broadcast, allowing you to filter unwanted background noise from your own microphone or even from someone else’s device if you’re on a call. AMD has integrated its Noise Suppression feature directly into the Adrenalin interface, so you don’t need to download a separate app like Nvidia requires to use RTX Broadcast.
To take advantage of AMD Noise Suppression, you’ll need a Ryzen 5000 series...

Google is adding “photorealistic aerial views” to almost 100 landmarks in Google Maps, the company announced on Wednesday. The views, which remind me of Apple Maps’ Flyover feature, give you an overhead look at landmarks in cities including Barcelona, London, New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo, according to Google.
You can get an idea of what the new aerial views look like in this GIF from the company:
The aerial views are a “first step” toward launching the “immersive view” the company showed off at Google I/O, according to a blog post from Google Maps director of product Amanda Leicht Moore. Immersive view will also include indoor views and information like traffic and the weather layered on the map, Google spokesperson...

                              <span>Encircled in roughly textured bark, thin woodcuts become canvases for the whimsical landscapes and scenes illustrated by Melpomeni Chatzipanagiotou. The Greek artist uses a combination of  pen, ink, gouache, and acrylic paint to draw outdoor vignettes cloaked in pattern and cosmic details. Nighttime skies are brimming with snowflakes, stars, and light trails that illuminate the natural subject matter and add a dose of fantasy to the heavily patterned works. 
Chatzipanagiotou has a number of illustrations on wood and paper available on Etsy, and you can watch her at work on Instagram. More</span>

                              <span>Seasons and the natural rhythms of bees determine much of Ava Roth’s practice, which hinges on collaborating with the fuzzy pollinators. The Ontario-based artist (previously) stitches elaborate embroideries with beads and intricate thread-based motifs that, once her contribution is complete, she turns over to her insect counterparts. The critters then finish the mixed-media pieces by embedding them in golden, hexagonal honeycomb.
Because the bees Roth works with only produce the waxy substance during the heat of the summer, the time available for inter-species cooperation is limited. More</span>

In Expression Corporelle, the French artist renders a cast of gymnast-emulating animals native to Australia, each with unusually strong appendages and flexible backs. The creatures balance on their tails and bend at perfect 90-degree angles, defying physics in favor of warped perspectives and the opportunity to see the world from a different point of view.

                              <span>前言
其实标题有点吹牛逼了，谁也不敢说能完美适配平板，只能说尽力去做，包括显示和使用的各个方面尽力去做，才有可能在更多的平板设备上更加完美的运行起来，因为安卓的设备实在是太多了，之前手机在卷，现在平板也一样在卷。。。
老生常谈，屏幕适配
首先来看下最直观的屏幕适配吧，毕竟是直接展示给用户看的嘛！
今日头条的方法
其实说起适配大家首先想到的大名鼎鼎的今日头条的屏幕适配方案，但是！凡事就怕但是！
今日头条适配方案原理在于通过公式 density &#x3D; 设备真实宽度(单位px)/设计图总宽度(单位dp)，在确保设计图总宽度(单位dp)一定时，通过修改 density 值，确保所有不同尺寸分辨率设备计算出的真实宽度值正好是屏幕宽度。
如果啊，我是说如果！如果所有的安卓设备都是手机的话这不就是完美的解决方案嘛！但事实往往不尽人意，还有 Pad 。。。Pad 和手机完完全全是两码事，屏幕大小差异太大不说，而且 Pad 的常态是横屏，但市面上大多数应用都限制死了竖屏操作，导致应用在 Pad 上根本无法使用或者使用效果特别差！
大家可以看下一些主流应用在 Pad 上的显示效果：

其实不止这一个应用，很多都显示地不尽人意，那么应该如何同时适配好手机和 Pad 呢？
简单粗暴的方法
什么方法呢？很简单，直接做两个应用！一个适配手机，另外一个适配 Pad，例如：爱某艺、央某影音、哔哩某哩等等。但是要注意，手机上你可以不适配横竖屏，但是 Pad 上就显得尤为重要了，切换横竖屏就意味着要重走生命周期，重走生命周期就意味着数据都得保存好，数据保存不好就意味着有 bug。。。。
这种方法是土豪做的，一般小公司支撑不住，大家可以量力而行😂😂😂。
下面来欣赏下哔哩某哩在 Pad 上的显示效果：

普通应用的方法
普通应用其实使用这种方法就可以，什么方法呢？也很简单，就是通过限定符进行限定，编写多套布局…</span>

                              <span>Flutter 有众多的状态管理方案，我除了对 Provider 有一些了解外，其它的一概不熟悉，主要还是因为接触 Flutter 的时间太短。
我目前一直是用的原生的 setState，它已经能很好的满足我的需要了。并且它足够简单。我目前基于自己的业务场景似乎找不到任何去选用其它状态管理库的理由。
我一直认为对于一个库来讲，解决问题并保持简单好用是最重要的。如果背离了这个点，就很有可能导致过度设计。我见过一些人把我认为的最差实践当成了最佳实践，而他们却浑然不知。
当然使用 setState 时，也不是完全的裸用。我做了相当轻量级的封装，只有 110 行代码。我把它称为 PVState 架构模式。它既是一种和传统 MVC、MVP 平辈的架构模式，也是一个轻量级的状态管理方案。我们来一探究竟吧。
PVState 概念介绍
首先我封装了一个 BaseState，所有的 State 都直接或间接地继承了它。它的子类分为两种，P State 和 V State。P State 的全称是 Presenter State，它负责业务逻辑。V State 的全称是 View State，它负责 UI，主要是重写 build 方法建立数据和 Widget 的单向绑定关系。
它们的关系如图所示：

这里有一个很重要的点是 V State 继承了 P State。
原则上来讲，所有与业务逻辑相关的方法、变量、表达式均定义在 P State 中。所有与 UI 相关的东西比如约束布局的 id、颜色、buildXXX 系列方法均定义在 V State 中。由于两者的继承关系，V State 可以无缝地访问 P State 中定义的各种方法、变量、表达式。
当要更新 UI 时，只需要在 P State 中调用 setState 即可。业务逻辑和 UI 实现了完全解耦，同时保持了简单。
由于这个架构模式…</span>

前言
在网络速度较慢的场景，一个有趣的加载会提高用户的耐心和对 App 的好感，有些 loading 动效甚至会让用户有想弄清楚整个动效过程到底是怎么样的冲动。然而，大部分的 App的 loading 就是下面这种千篇一律的效果 —— 俗称“转圈”。


本篇我们利用Flutter 的 PathMetric来玩几个有趣的 loading 效果。
效果1：圆环内滚动的球

如上图所示，一个红色的小球在蓝色的圆环内滚动，而且在往上滚动的时候速度慢，往下滚动的时候有个明显的加速过程。这个效果实现的思路如下：
绘制一个蓝色的圆环，在蓝色的圆环内构建一个半径更小一号的圆环路径（Path）。
让红色小球在动画控制下沿着内部的圆环定义的路径运动。
选择一个中间减速（上坡）两边加速的动画曲线。
下面是实现代码：
// 动画控制设置
controller &#x3D;
  AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 3), vsync: this);
animation &#x3D; Tween(begin: 0, end: 1.0).animate(CurvedAnimation(
  parent: controller,
  curve: Curves.slowMiddle,
))
..addListener(() {
  setState(() {});
});

// 绘制和动画控制方法
_drawLoadingCircle(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  var paint &#x3D; Paint()..style &#x3D; PaintingStyle…</span>

上学时最常有的作业就是限制在两千字以内的短 essay，需要引用参考文献，针对某个指定话题援引正反方观点，或者针对某个问题讲述现状及未来的可能发展方向。有时也需要联系同时在学的好几门课，从不同角度切入分析同一个问题。
写作的套路没什么新奇，我一般分成三步：

首先是看一定数量的资料，对这个话题的背景和相关知识有一定的了解，收集有用的信息；
其次是通过已知信息，大概整理出文章框架，包括大致结构、需要提及的论点，以及目前的发现如何支持这些论点；
最后就是整合前两步的发现，写完这篇文章。

其中前两步往往是同时进行，不分先后：了解了基本信息就可以开始搭建结构，在梳理论点和证据时如果出现了逻辑上的断层，就得找更多文献填补空缺。而只要这两步做得足够细致，写作时就可以顺着大纲一路写下去，行云流水毫无阻滞。

然而在实际操作中，却有件事一直困扰我。当时用的软件是 Mendeley 和 MS Word 或 Scrivener 的组合，若想要把找到的资料，按照文章的结构而非阅读顺序，依次放置在合适的位置，并且能够迅速找到引文出处，就只能靠多开窗口和详细记录引文位置来弥补单个软件的不足，稍有不慎就得翻遍资料库寻找某句话到底出自哪篇文章……非常痛苦。
因此，我希望能有一款软件，让我在查阅文献资料时有个「卡片」可以同时存放引文和我自己的总结，并且能及时链接到原文的位置，写作时自动生成参考文献；同时这个卡片可以自由移动，并组成一个思维导图，方便我构建大纲。
直到我最近发现，MarginNote 和上面那个组合相比，能更好地…</span>

                              <span>benb: 写 Go 代码时，如果你的代码规模达到一定规模，为了代码的复用性和可维护性，你可能会用构造器这种设计模式：
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;go
type UserService struct {
    repository *Repository
    logger *log.Logger
}
// 构造器
func NewUserService(repo *Repository, logger *log.Logger) *UserService {
    return &amp;UserService{ repo, logger }
}&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
如果你懒得为那么多 struct 编写 NewXX 构造器，不妨试试这个工具。
https://github.com/Bin-Huang/make-constructor
这个工具不需要安装，只需要代码里加一行注释，Go 就会自动帮你生成构造器代码。
它设计的主要目的不是偷懒，而是更好地维护项目代码。不管是编写还是更新构造器代码，都是一个费力且容易出错的事情，这些应该交给自动程序。
尤其是维护比较大的代码仓库，这个工具不但让人省心，还可以和 wire 这类依赖注入工具完美兼容契合。
这行注释可能有点长，但每次使用都不需要参数，和 VS Code 快捷输入之类的搭配起来很香。
无需手动安装的这个特性，更是为了方便团队合作。这样其他人就算没有安装这个工具，执行代码也能正常工作，减少了打断和问询的时间成本。

https://github.com/jack139/go-infer
深度学习模型在部署时通常以云方式部署，通过 API 对外体提供推理服务。这个框架提供了部署 API 时的基本架构组件，实现了几个目标：
API 处理模块与模型推理模块解耦，降低高并发造成的网络和计算阻塞风险
API 处理模块与模型推理模块可进行分布式部署，均可实现横向扩展
使用 Go 语言实现，提高执行效率，简化部署和运维
业务逻辑使用 callback 方式调用，隐藏通用逻辑，开发时只需关注业务逻辑
其他功能：
服务端配置使用 Yaml ，分布式部署时可进行针对性配置
API 验签支持 SHA256 和 SM2 算法

在 vm fusion12 里，只有看流媒体的时候掉帧，本地视频 不会掉帧
vm 虚拟机设置，有开启所有程序都启用高性能显卡

目前我用的是 P40 pro 和 P50 pro ，就我认知范围内的理解，除了微信和 QQ ，app 的消息推送基本都是通过华为处理的，但是我安装了 Skype 和 Telegram ，经常性被杀后台，消息接收不及时，即便手动开启常驻后台，也效果不大，毕竟这俩东西应该不会通过国内的统一推送。
正好看到某个博主上手 Pixel 6A ，想起请教各位 v2er ，这个所谓谷歌原生的手机和系统，以及它自带的 gcm 推送系统，能否解决以上国内安卓系统的 bug ？（默认开梯子）
QQ 和微信是通过 gcm 吗？
Skype 和 telegram 是通过 gcm 吗？
如果能解决这个海外 app 的消息推送痛点，那就入手一个 6A 试试。
谢谢各位。</span>

首先，可以参考以下这篇文章，在构建命令的时候多加注意，避免触及安全边界：云原生时代下的容器镜像安全（上）
接下来，我们可以通过已有的镜像安全检测工具，对早已存在的镜像进行安全扫描，并对当前正在构建的镜像设置阻断规则，将安全防护前移至 CI/CD 阶段，当前市面上已知的镜像检测工具有：trivy 、anchor 、veinmind 等，我只使用了 veinmind ，所以描述一下 veinmind 的详细功能：
首先 veinmind 支持检测镜像内的恶意文件、敏感信息、弱口令、后门、异常历史命令，支持镜像资产清点，支持集成到 CI/CD 进行检测，支持镜像阻断，支持使用 helm 安装部署。
一、docker 镜像阻断功能：
# first
./veinmind-runner authz -c config.toml 
# second
dockerd --authorization-plugin&#x3D;veinmind-broker

其中 config.toml,包含如下字段

字段名
字段属性
含义




policy
action
string
需要监控的行为



enabled_plugins
[]string
使用哪些插件



plugin_params
[]string
各个插件的参数



risk_level_filter
[]string
风险等级



block
bool
是否阻断



alert
bool
是否报警


log
report_log_path
string
插件扫描日志



authz_log_path
string
阻断服务日志


action 原则上支持 DockerAPI 所提供的操作接口

如果说一些软件，在 windows 上可以任意的访问本地文件，那 chrome 里面的各个网站 cookie 如何安全的储存在本地？如果能访问，是不是就可以窃取用户身份了
有没有 v 友帮忙科普一下，感谢</span>

最近自己写了一个 npm 包，在 package.json 下面有如下代码：
{
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;./dist/index.common.js&quot;,
  &quot;module&quot;: &quot;./dist/index.esm.js&quot;,
  &quot;types&quot;: &quot;./dist/index.d.ts&quot;,
}


按照我的理解，在 esm 中用 import 导入应该导入的是 module 字段指向的 js ，但是我建了一个 npm 项目,代码如下：
import a from &quot;my-utils&quot;;


执行命令： node index.mjs 导入的却是 main 指向的 js 文件。</span>

2. reset ，用了一段时间仍然会出问题
3. 群晖无法登录的时候 docker 服务正常，安装的虚拟机服务也正常
4. 联系群晖技术支持，没查出原因，建议拿掉第三方内存

                              <span>Just incase you&#x27;re wondering how to boost your dev server if you already got a project up and running with our beautiful react application, here I will show you how to infuse Vite into your project and experience that speed you&#x27;ve always wanted.
Also if you are wondering what is Vite and probably want to use it, you can checkout my last tutorial on &#x27;How to use Vite with React&#x27;
Without no further a do...
A running react application
A good network
Setup the required packages from you terminal like this
$ yarn add vite @vitejs/plugin-react-refresh

Create a vite.config.js file in your root folder and add the following code
// vite.config.js

import { defineConfig } from &#x27;vite&#x27;
import reactRefresh from &#x27;@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh&#x27;

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactRefresh()]
})

This config file pre-bundles your dependencies when sever is running.
From your root folder too, edit your package.json. This define the bundler for starting, building and previewing the application from the initial react-create start...
// package.json

  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;vite&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;vite build&quot;,
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;vite test&quot;,
    &quot;eject&quot;: &quot;vite eject&quot;
  },

Still from your root folder, open /public folder and move the index.html file to the parent folder.
%PUBLIC_URL% attached too any 
 and a  tag and hence reference to the appropriate directory like so /src/index.js/.

...
    

    


You can now run
$ yarn start

Happy vite coding.</span>

                              <span>Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside a class component, only in a function component.
Making unique hooks should be prioritized over repetitive coding and adhering to recommended practices.
One of the cool things about React is the use of reusable components and this is not limited to JSX components in React, functions themselves are reusable. When creating an application, you will frequently execute data retrieval that is connected to the state and lifecycle of the program.
The goal of a custom hook is to create a function that you can quickly reuse in different area of your application to avoid DRY code and improve your application performance and efficiency.

                              <span>once upon a time ⏲️
A farmer found an abandoned eagle’s nest.
And in it was an egg still warm. 🌺 🥚
looking out…
there was no sign of its mother or of its siblings 👩‍👧
And so the farmer feared for the little eagle’s life.
and took the egg back to his farm 🏡
and laid it in the nest of one of his hens
After two weeks, the egg hatched 🐣
and out came a little baby eagle 🦅
the hens looked after the eagle
as if it were a little chicken 🐤
And so the eagle grew up.
Along with the other chickens 🐓
it pecked about the farm yard
scrabbling for grain 🌾
It ran into the chicken house. 🏡
When it started to rain 🌧️ it did exactly what all the other chickens did.
All his life…
It spent its whole life within the yard and rarely looked up.
Because, all the other chickens never looked up 🙄
After it had a very long, uncomfortable life in the chicken yard.
It was very old, and one day…
It decided to lift up its head, and so above a wonderful sight. 🌌
He saw an eagle soaring high above in the sky.
Looking at it, the old creature sighed and said to itself:
❝If only I had been born an eagle! 🦅❞
You see in life, in your life
You only have one life. 💖
let no one tell you what you can or can’t do 🙅‍♂️
because it is only up to you
You were born an eagle but decided to live as a chicken because all the others did the same. 🐓
What you don’t know is…🤔
that you are the eagle 🦅
that you are the Lion 🦁
that you are the chicken 🐓
That all the strength and might you need to fulfill all of your dreams in your life are already within you. 💪
Your decision not to look up into the sky and understand that you are an eagle, and as time will pass you become old; and one day when you realize that you are an eagle, it might be too late to change.
So go after your dreams today and believe that you can achieve anything that you want.
“Never judge an eagle by the opinion of turkeys.”</span>

Infrastructures As Code (IaC) is a process or methodology whereby infrastructure is managed as code, i.e. it is treated as if it were software. This means that infrastructure can be version-controlled, peer-reviewed, and automated just like software. 
IaC can help you manage your infrastructure more effectively, by defining your infrastructure in code, you can easily track changes and ensure that all changes are made consistently across your entire infrastructure. This can help you avoid configuration drift and make it easier to roll back changes if necessary.
There are many benefits of using IaC (Infrastructure as Code). IaC can help you manage and provision your infrastructure more effectively and efficiently. Here are some benefits of using IaC:

Hello all, as you guys probably know, monkeytype is a typing test application with customizable themes and modes, popular among typing enthusiasts. I thought it will be a good project for me to practice frontend development, so I gave it a go.
After two weeks of coding, I actually ended up making the app available for multiplayer use too. Anyone can play with their friends, chat with the public, and join rooms.
Try it out here
This is how the app looks like.

Generics means parameterized types. Put simply, generics allow programmers to write code where the type can be specified later because the type isn&#x27;t immediately relevant.
Let&#x27;s take a look at an example to understand this better.
For our example, we have simple sum functions for different types such as int, float64, and string. Since method overriding is not allowed in Go we usually have to create new functions.
package main

import &quot;fmt&quot;

func sumInt(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func sumFloat(a, b float64) float64 {
    return a + b
}

func sumString(a, b string) string {
    return a + b
}

Today I&#x27;m here with another interesting Linux tool. This one would help you with partitioning block devices in Linux. The tool is called LVM and this article would be an introduction for that. Without further delay, let&#x27;s start.

According to the Wikipedia;
In computer storage, logical volume management or LVM provides a method of allocating space on mass-storage devices that is more flexible than conventional partitioning schemes to store volumes. In particular, a volume manager can concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine partitions (or block devices in general) into larger virtual partitions that administrators can re-size or move, potentially without interrupting system use

Managing files in a graphical desktop like GNOME or KDE is an exercise in point-and-click. To move a file into a folder, you click and drag the icon to its new home. To remove a file, you drag it into the “Trash” icon. The graphical interface makes desktop computing easy to use.
But we don&#x27;t always interact with Linux systems with a graphical interface. If you work on a server, you likely need to use the command line to get around. Even desktop users like me might prefer to interact with their system through a terminal and command line. I tend to rely on a few commands to manage my files from the command line:

A few weeks ago, HP joined the bandwagon of major laptop manufacturers releasing a Linux-based laptop, the HP Dev One. The brand joins others such as Lenovo and Dell, offering a laptop with a pre-installed distribution of Linux in the US market. HP joined forces with smaller Linux-based laptop brand System76 to pre-install Pop!_OS as their distribution of choice on the device. Pop!_OS is a Ubuntu-based distribution, which System76 started (and is currently the primary maintainer) to maximize the features of its own laptops sold on its website.
This article is a quick look at the HP Dev One, including first impressions of the hardware itself and running the pre-installed P…</span>

Satellite companies OneWeb and Eutelsat have agreed to a $3.4 billion merger to create a player in global internet connections that competes with SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s Kuiper. Combined, the two companies say they will tie together low Earth orbit satellites that offer faster connections with less lag and geostationary satellites that have more capacity and cover wider areas, with OneWeb continuing to operate as its own brand under Eutelsat.
France-based Eutelsat provides television and internet via 36 satellites in geostationary orbits around the Earth’s equator. OneWeb, which launched its first internet-broadcasting satellites in early 2019, currently has about 428 satellites in orbit out of the 648 it plans to have as part of...

Development of the upcoming Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake for the PS5 and PC is on pause, according to Bloomberg. The game’s art director and design director were also fired earlier this month after the development team showed a demo of the game to Lucasfilm and Sony. 
The Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) remake was first announced at Sony’s big fall showcase last September, but developer Aspyr Media, which is owned by Embracer Group, hasn’t yet shared a release timeframe for the title. The remake has been in development for three years, and while the original plan was to release the game by the end of 2022, a more “realistic target” is now 2025, Bloomberg reports.
Saber Interactive, another Embracer Group studio, is...

You know, I didn’t want to join Instagram, but I had adopted a kitten with an internet following, and the following wanted to know how the kitten was doing. For a while, I dutifully updated once a week. But then Instagram started to change.
Two big things happened in 2016. First, there were the changes to the feed. Algorithmic. Well, all right. Then, the Snapchat imitation: the Story. It was whatever. I didn’t mind it. After a while, I stopped posting photos in favor of posting Stories because more people looked at the Stories. There started to be more ads clogging the Stories, so I stopped watching as many. And I stopped posting photos or Stories as often.

When we last spoke with Everrati CEO Justin Lunny, his UK-based restomod company that converts iconic cars to electric vehicles was expanding into the US market. Since then, the company set up headquarters in Calabasas, California, and in April, it partnered with Irvine-based manufacturer Aria Group to work on state-side electric conversions of Porsches and other prestige vehicles. Now Aria Group is helping build the first Everrati Porsche in California, and the owner of that car is a major investor: former Nest CEO Matt Rogers.
Rogers’ car is a Porsche 911 (type 964) wide body, similar to his father’s that he has fond memories of riding in as a kid. Since then, he promised himself that he’d get one, too, but only if it were electric....

On Tuesday, the White House officially threw its support behind a bill pushed by Tiger King star Carole Baskin to restrict exotic animal ownership.
In a statement, the Biden administration said that the Big Cat Public Safety Act “would build on existing laws that protect big cats like tigers, cheetahs, jaguars, and other wild animals living in captivity in the United States” and “limit ownership of these animals to zoos, sanctuaries, universities, and agencies.”
The measure — introduced by Rep. Mike Quigley (D-IL) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) — would formally ban the cub petting industry of lions, tigers, and other big cats featured in Netflix’s hit Tiger King documentary released in 2020. As highlighted in the show, private zoos...

Amazon is raising the price of its Prime subscription across Europe in September by up to 43 percent a year. In an email to customers overnight, Amazon revealed its annual Prime cost will jump 20 percent in the UK from £79 to £95 from September 15th. In France the price hike is even more acute, moving from €49 per year to €69.90 — a 43 percent increase.
Amazon will also hike prices in Spain and Italy by 39 percent annually, with the company’s second-biggest market, Germany, seeing an annual 30 percent rise. Amazon’s Prime price increases in Europe come just months after the price of Prime in the US rose to $139 per year, up from the previous $119 annual fee. Amazon Prime typically includes fast shipping, access to sales, and free movie /...

Logitech has announced a lineup of PC gaming accessories that are designed to be more gender-inclusive — and specifically geared toward women — than any of its previous releases. Companies shouldn’t be trying to market consumer technology by gender in 2022 and should instead recognize the wide variety of tastes and physical needs consumers have. But Logitech’s gone and done it anyway.
And the gadgets in the Aurora collection do seem cool, and notably, they’re new — not just new colorways of existing products. But aside from a few interesting features across the entirety of the Aurora collection, it still feels like a case of the pink tax at work.

Working with a color palette of pastels and neutral tones, the Spanish artist (previously) paints large-scale portraits, fragments of limbs, and birds, often leaving the composition’s skeletal forms visible. “The supports are just as important as the work itself,” he tells Colossal. “I look for camouflage, minimalism, and mixture. In the end, it is also a metaphorical form of the footprint that I believe we should leave in the places we pass through.”

                              <span>Finnish artist Raija Jokinen (previously) echoes the natural shapes of botanics and anatomy in her elaborately formed figures. The sculptural works are comprised of sprawling webs that appear like both root and vein systems, with flowers and more dense, fleshy patches emerging from an arm or torso. Each piece fuses the physical and mental, Jokinen says, sharing that her “approach is focused on everyday feelings, situations, and thoughts we all have.”
The mesh works are created from flax—Jokinen employs a technique similar to that used for handmade paper—that she dyes and molds into branches, twigs, and other organic forms. More</span>

前谷歌 CEO Eric Schmidt 将 AI 比作核武器，呼吁建立类似相互保证毁灭的威慑制度，防止世界最强大的国家率先发动攻击。在上个世纪的五六十年代，美国和苏联这两个超级大国最终达成了核武器试验条约，以防止核试验粉尘扩散。Schmidt 认为中美可能需要在 AI 领域达成类似的条约。

老王点评：或许有一天 AI 武器化，真的需要到了各个 AI 大国坐下来制定一些规则，但是目前这个论调显然是针对性的攻击而已。




流行的 KDE 桌面停靠区 Latte Dock 停止开发

在过去的几年里，Latte Dock 一直是 KDE Plasma 桌面上流行的类似 macOS 的桌面停靠区。它去年发布了 0.10。昨天，它的作者宣布已经结束了在这个项目上的工作，“我正在退出 Latte 的开发。主要是我没有时间、动力或兴趣了……我希望我能够发布 Latte v0.11，但不幸的是我做不到。”他也希望有其他开发者接手开发这个已经有 6 年之久的流行软件。

老王点评：虽然很可惜，不过我想以开源社区的生命力，很快就会有人接手或出现它的复刻版。




科技公司们倡议废除闰秒

谷歌、微软、Meta 和亚马逊周一发起了一项旨在废除闰秒的公共行动，美国和法国计时当局已对此举表示赞同。1972 年以来，已经增加了 27 次闰秒。在增加闰秒时，23:59:59 的下一秒并非变成 00:00:00，而是会额外增加一个 23:59:60 的计时，也就是最后一分钟变成 61 秒。这就会给计算机造成很大的困扰，尤其是那些需要依赖精确的计时服务器的服务，它曾在 2012 年引发了 Reddit 的大规模宕机。谷歌率先提出了“闰秒弥补”的解决方案，即在一天的过程中以许多微小的步进来弥补闰秒的变化。

老王点评：1972 年制定闰秒政策时，并没有考虑当时刚刚开始的互联网服务，但是现在互联网已经空前强大，应该采取更好的解决闰秒问题的方法。</span>

有许多关于为什么 C 语言能够经久不衰的说法。或许是因为它语法简单明了。又或许是因为它常被认为是实用的语言，因为它不基于其他高级语言，可以在任何平台上编译运行。C 显然是一种强大的语言，并且我认为它经久不衰与它作为其他技术的基础的方式相关。这里有 5 项我喜爱的基于 C 语言的技术，希望它们能够帮助你更多的了解 C 语言。

1、GObject 和 GTK

C 语言不是面向对象编程的语言。它没有 class 关键字。 一些人用 C++ 进行面向对象编程，但是还有一些人坚持用 C 和 GObject 库。GObject 库为 C 语言提供了一个 class 结构体，GTK 项目以提供可通过 C 访问的工具包而闻名。没有 GTK ，就没有 GIMP （GTK 就是为此开发的）、GNOME 和其他成千上百流行的开源应用。

GObject 和 GTK 是使用 C 开始进行 GUI 编程的绝佳方式。它们“装备精良”，可以让你用 C 语言进行图形应用的编程，因为开发者为你做了许多“繁重工作”。他们定义了类和数据类型，创建了工具包，你所要做的就是将所有东西放在一起。

2、Ncurses

如果 GTK 超过了你的需求，你或许认为一个终端用户界面terminal user interface（TUI）更适合你。Ncurses 库可以在终端创建“小部件”，创建一种在终端窗口上绘制图形的应用程序。你可以使用方向键控制界面，选择按钮和元素，就像不用鼠标来使用 GUI 应用一样。

                              <span>使用我在 Linux 上制作的这个 C 程序在旅途中聆听你喜爱的歌曲。


我最近在 Linux 中编写了一个 C 程序，从我广泛的 MP3 库中创建一个较小的随机 MP3 文件选集。该程序会遍历一个包含我的 MP3 库的目录，然后创建一个包含随机的、较小的歌曲选集的目录。然后我将这些 MP3 文件复制到我的智能手机上，以便随时随地收听。

瑞典是一个人口稀少的国家，有许多农村地区没有完整的手机覆盖。这就是在智能手机上拥有 MP3 文件的原因之一。另一个原因是我并不总是有钱购买流媒体服务，所以我喜欢拥有自己喜欢的歌曲的副本。

你可以从它的 Git 仓库 下载我的应用。我专门为 Linux 编写了它，部分原因是在 Linux 上很容易找到经过良好测试的文件 I/O 例程。多年前，我尝试使用专有的 C 库在 Windows 上编写相同的程序，但在尝试文件复制时遇到了困难。Linux 使用户可以轻松直接地访问文件系统。

本着开源的精神，我没费多少力气就找到了 Linux 的文件 I/O 代码来激发我的灵感。我还发现了一些启发了我的分配内存的代码。我编写了随机数生成的代码。

该程序的工作方式如下所述：


询问源目录和目标目录。

询问存放 MP3 文件的目录下的文件个数。

搜索你希望复制的收藏的百分比（从 1.0% 到 88.0%）。如果你有 1000 个文件的集合，并希望从你的集合中复制 125 个文件而不是 120 个文件，你也可以输入 12.5% 之类的数字。我将上限设置为 88%，因为复制超过 88% 的库将基本生成与你的基础库相似的库。当然，代码是开源的，因此你可以根据自己的喜好自由修改。

使用指针和 malloc 分配内存。一些操作需要内存，包括代表音乐收藏中文件的字符串列表。还有一个列表来保存随机生成的数字。

                              <span>在本指南中，我们将解释在 Arch Linux 中安装漂亮的深度桌面（DDE）所需的步骤。


指南的第一部分解释了安装 Arch 基本系统的步骤。第二部分是在 Arch Linux 的基础上安装完整的深度桌面。

什么是深度桌面（DDE）？

深度操作系统 是一个基于 Debian 稳定分支的、功能丰富且漂亮的桌面环境。深度桌面环境（DDE）是深度操作系统自主开发的桌面环境。它由它自己的 dde-kwin 窗口管理器驱动。深度桌面带有漂亮的停靠区和许多预装的深度原生的应用程序。

这个令人眼花缭乱的桌面环境 可在 Arch 仓库中找到；这篇文章介绍了如何在 Arch Linux 中安装深度桌面。

本指南安装深度桌面环境 20.1。然而，其他版本的步骤也应该是类似的。

第一部分：安装 Arch Linux

如果你已经安装了 Arch Linux，你可以跳过这一步，直接进入安装深度桌面部分。

要快速安装基本的 Arch Linux，请按照以下步骤进行。你也可以访问 本指南 了解以双启动或在虚拟机上安装 Arch Linux 的完整教程。

下载 Arch Linux

从下面的链接下载 Arch Linux 的 .iso 文件。这里有磁力链和 BT 链接。一旦你下载好了，就把 ISO 写入 U 盘。然后从该驱动器启动。


下载 Arch Linux


如果你打算通过 GNOME Boxes、virt-manager 将其安装为虚拟机镜像 —— 那么你不需要将其写入 U 盘。

启动和配置分区

从 Arch Linux ISO 启动后，你必须运行一系列的命令来安装基本系统。

首先，运行下面的命令，找出设备的标识符。

fdisk -l




然后用此设备标识符，运行下面的命令，开始对你的磁盘进行分区。请确保根据你的系…</span>

前言
从大二上学期开始重新拾起书本大量阅读，到现在差不多刚好一年。这一年里我迭代了许多次学习方法，从最开始的抱着纸质书硬啃，到开始用笔划线做笔记，再到把笔记收集在备忘录，接着开始换电子书，又经历有道云笔记和Obsidian，最后到现在这套自用的学习流程，真的是历经九曲十八弯。
在我目前的理解里，学习的本质就是接触到陌生的信息，然后进行翻译，转化为自己能理解的知识并形成长期记忆，最后在正确的情境下进行正确运用的过程。
根据上述理解，以下是我精简后的学习流程及相关工具。
第一步，阅读时凡是遇到自己有所触动的句子，立刻划线（or摘录）。【微信读书等媒介】
第二步，复述划线句，想象自己将要把这个句子解释给别人。
第三步，所有划线句定期复习。【氢刻】
第四步，根据划线句内容将其分为三类，不同类别不同处理。
     What——概念/观点——以卡片形式记录，不同概念多加碰撞。【幕布】
     Why——原理/本质——及时复习即可，重在理解。【氢刻】
     How——方法/流程——根据主题进行整合，旨在形成自己独有的方法论。【幕布】
第五步，想象每个知识点可能存在的使用场景，以图在未来生活中切实应用。

信息输入
这是一个信息爆炸的时代，我们每天都在接触数以千万计的信息量，但同时我们的精力又是如此有限，因此我们需要有意识地选择高质量的信息来学习。
我目前的信息来源主要是三个方面，书籍、论文和精选社区。
微信读书——腾讯最后的良心
我最早开始电子书阅读是在知乎，里面的会员专栏里有不少好书，但知乎不支持搜索书籍，书籍量也不多，所以最后还是选择了微信读书。在微信读书，90%我想看的书都能找到，而且微信读书没有广告，阅读过程相当赏心悦目。
此外，微信读书的附加功能也比较齐全，仅划线一项就支持荧光笔、直线、波浪线三种划线方式，且所有划线句最后都可以一键导出。

日式整理术的概念，出自《佐藤可士和的超整理术》，是一种能够指导生活方式或是影响工作流的方法论。根据佐藤的阐述，其整理术主要分为三个维度。

空间整理术 —— 讲求「物」的固定位置，归类，优先级的排序；留下或是扔掉。
信息整理术 —— 对文字、图片影像、数据的线形，树形或网状结构归纳。
思维整理术 —— 对「抽象」「混沌」等概念性、无意识内容的可视化、语言化或“意识化”；保存或是删除。

空间整理术 —— 「对所有之物的斟酌」

有关于「量」

我自己从小就是一个囤积狂魔，所有必需品必须是用一囤一，对心爱的事物不满足于只拥有一种款式。横向上我希望有用时下同一系列的所有款式（也就是收集癖），纵向上我期待所有新品，对热门稀有款更是虎视眈眈。后来我长大了，刚刚对金钱有一些许自由支配权，我就理所当然地又被各种社交媒体上的“花花世界”掌控—— 大牌口红的当季热门色号、各种各样像调色盘一般的眼影腮红盘、成份奇妙能使一夜回春的护肤品、花里胡哨的快时尚单品…… 它们没有一样不在扰动我欲望的神经。我的多巴胺就在等快递的时候无限分泌，在拆快递的时候达到顶峰，又在切实拥有“美物”的一瞬间消失殆尽，周而复始，无限循环。
而我的懒惰又让我所能真正使用到位的物品少之又少，每天早起让我没有太多时间化全妆，没有办法好好搭配我买的每一件“潮流单品”。为了避免太扎眼的look，我还是会因为效率和时间而选择低饱和的经典款和各种黑白灰。可谓是身在“潮”营，心在“汗”，穿搭博主穿她的，我依旧我行我“素”。
我并没有因为这些物品赋值，反而被夺去了自由 —— 我被时下热门控制了钱包，被塞得满满的房间夺走了空…</span>

                              <span>许多年前，有一个刚毕业的小镇青年，战战栗栗的步入了社会。在求职四处碰壁后，总算混到了一份在语言培训机构里做宣传招生的工作。按理说他应该要开心才对，但小镇终究是小镇，消费低工资低，房价很高。

于是小镇青年开始寻找兼职，最终总算托朋友的关系兼职了一份平面+3D效果师的工作。那时候自媒体刚刚兴起，小镇青年也步入了这行，不过也只能算是兼职。而后就是白天上班摸鱼，晚上画效果图，深夜为原创码字的日子。虽然很忙也很累，但小镇青年却觉得很充实。
几年下来，小镇青年也累积了几百篇的图文内容，虽然他在自媒体这行中也没有多少成就，也没有出现任何爆文，但他却获得了分享的乐趣。现在小镇青年开始折腾视频内容了，那么他又有什么经验值得分享呢?

Intro
首先是软件学习，Adobe Premiere Pro最好要会用，当然现在许多短视频也可以在手机上实现剪辑，比如剪映就是这样的工具。但个人觉得，最终还是要向专业靠拢的，所以Adobe Premiere Pro还是得要会用。

技巧学习上主要是转场效果。可以多看看别人的作品，从模仿开始。快慢帧和特效无缝转场要多学习一下，收集几套免费的剪辑素材和资料包。因为不是团队作战，所以精力会比较有限，所以脚本尽量参考别人的。如果不方便自己配音的话，可以考虑用机器声，比如剪映的文本朗读功能又或者是微软的Azure文本转语音。
这里推荐微软Azure云服务文字转语音功能。
azure.microsoft.com/zh-cn/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/

具体方式是使用它的试听功能+脚本插件来完成下载。插件名称是“Azure Speech Download”，以及Tampermonkey脚本。

                              <span>In the example below I have a sample app that I named owler_franchise in the setup process.

Now I want to change that to Owler Franchise.
iOS
For iOS, go to ios folder and find the folder named after your project name. 
owler_franchise. Inside that folder find the Info.plist file. 

Inside Info.plist file replace the value after CFBundleDisplayName to your app name.

For my example, I changed it to Owler Franchise. 

That&#x27;s it for iOS 👍.

Android
For Android: Go to the following folder in order: android &gt; app &gt; src &gt; main &gt; res &gt; values and open strings.xml file, replace the  tag&#x27;s value.


Again, in my example, I changed it to Owler Franchise:

That&#x27;s it for Android too ✅.

First let&#x27;s see what a Context Receiver is, before we take a look at how it can help us make our component easier to use.
Important: Kotlin Context Receiver is an experimental API, this means it could still be subject to change in the future, before a final release. Also the IDE support is currently limited as well.
Because of the experimental nature of Context Receivers, they are not enabled by default. To enable its usage we need to go to the build.gradle.kts or build.gradle file of our module and add -Xcontext-receivers as a free compiler arg.
In the build.gradle file of an Android module this looks something like this…</span>

                              <span>You know who I&#x27;m talking about right? It&#x27;s that entity/being that makes sure that your code does not function the same way in your local, development and production environments. Well, he&#x27;s a gnome and is called Bob Stinkycode.
I imagine he looks something like this after he&#x27;s messed with you:

Let&#x27;s see an example: you&#x27;ve been working on a feature for a while, you&#x27;ve tested and everything works perfectly. Then the code is deployed to a real environment and some part of the feature that worked and had been tested extensively before does not work. You check and double check and crap, theoretically it should work, you can&#x27;t explain why the hell it&#x27;s failing... and of course your code is perfect and the only posible explanation is that the Bob has done it again, he is messing with your code...
It&#x27;s a hard problem to solve, as Bob decides when to let the code work and when to mess with it. If you look for him you will not find him, he has 1000s of lines of code, 100s of folders and 10s of services and processes to hide... 
The only solution is to accept it, and let him get tired, once he get&#x27;s bored your code will work again... Don&#x27;t waste your time trying to solve it xD 
Another example: A user reports a bug, we have screenshots, reports in Sentry, and when we try replicating it, it never happens again. This is also Bob&#x27;s fault.

Jokes aside, I think Bob is just a metaphor of the ego and/or pride of a developer. Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to swallow, than to accept your code has flaws. I&#x27;m guilty of this, but try to always tell myself that bob is just uncertainty and ignorance about a bug. 
That&#x27;s it for me, hope you enjoyed the quick read. Do you have experience with Bob Stinkycode? How do you call him?

When it comes to a take-home coding challenge, the first thing that most developers think of is, &quot;Sweet! I can just google for the answer&quot;. However, this is where they all fail.
So, how do you pass to take home coding challenge?
1. Take your time understanding the problem, there is no fire.

When I receive a technical challenge, I would read it multiple times and take notes on what has been asked to develop. My notes would consist of what I have to do step by step, so I won&#x27;t waste time on something that the requirement didn&#x27;t even ask. For example, this is what my notes would look like:

                              <span>It&#x27;s only natural for us humans, to get distracted by literally anything other than what we should focus on.
The same can be said for reading articles.
For browsers there is a feature called reader mode, it removes all the distractions from the webpage so you can focus on the content itself.

For Chrome however, this is not yet a public feature, but you can enable it today!
And i&#x27;ll show you how you can do just that.
Open up your Google Chrome browser and in the address bar type the following link: chrome://flags.
This will open a page where you can control certain flags for your browser.
In the top search field search for: &quot;Enable Reader Mode&quot;.
You&#x27;ll notice a dropdown on the side of it, it should be set to default. Change this value to be enabled.

As soon as you change this value Chrome will ask you to relaunch your browser.
Now that you have reader mode enabled, visit any article, for instance use the one you are on right now.
In the address bar you&#x27;ll now notice this little symbol that looks like a newspapper.

Once you click it, it transform the webpage to a read only page.

people usually say you can make money with
Freelancing
Blogging

                              <span>A struct is a typed collection of fields, useful for grouping data into records. This allows all the data relating to one entity to be neatly encapsulated in one lightweight type definition, behavior can then be implemented by defining functions on the struct type.
This blog I will try to explain how we can efficiently write struct in terms of Memory Usages and CPU Cycles.

Let’s consider this struct below, definition of terraform resource type for some weird use-case I have:
type TerraformResource struct {
  Cloud                string                       // 16 bytes
  Name                 string                       // 16 bytes
  HaveDSL              bool                         //  1 byte
  PluginVersion        string                       // 16 bytes

There are compute services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate, while there are other integration services which binds various compute services, like AWS Step Functions, Amazon API Gateway, etc.
In this article, we are going to explore AWS Step Functions.
The official definition of AWS Step function is as follows:
Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. Through Step Functions&#x27; graphical console, you see your application’s workflow as a series of event-driven steps.
One of the most important characteristics of Step functions is that it uses Finite State Machines (FSM) model. The state machi…</span>

                              <span>CI jobs typically execute in a freshly spun-up container, with no leftover state from previous runs. This helps ensure that builds are repeatable. However it can also make them much slower than they need to be. Each run has to repeat a lot of time-consuming setup work, such as downloading and installing tools, and cannot rely on work done by previous runs, as you would when running build commands iteratively on your desktop.
Therefore most CI/CD providers offer a caching facility to speed up runs by selectively restoring state from previous runs. But because the details of your build workflows are opaque to the CI providers, they can only cache at a very coarse-grained level, and this limits how much benefit you can get from them.  Read on to see why!

/t/868776 有感
最近在培养下属进行团队管理，今天转了这篇文章给他，领导者管人的 10 条铁则，学会了，管人原来很简单：
https://sa.sogou.com/sgsearch/sgs_tc_news.php?req&#x3D;gNWjMh9kjpEtYgjReTdUXeJ_0xWrwbxWSExkKumgzN86VAnEKscI-EO-ByOQCJaC&amp;user_type&#x3D;1
不知道他能不能 get 到管理的技能点，尤其是培训他的下属的方法论。
过了没多久，我发现他在培养新人时，只是给人家转发了个这种文章——新手程序员必学 10 大技能： https://www.zentao.net/redirect-index-21640.html
这篇文章说的太泛泛，而且其实一些领域日后深挖的空间很大不是一朝一夕就能进阶的，更没有结合工作实践，培养技术新人的比较好的方法，应该是首先要有自己的项目规范，分配任务给新人后，既要指导技术相关的知识点，也要教新人工作流相关的流程、工具，还要根据新人的性格特点来促进他与团队的磨合、沟通能力的提升。
我最近带他有点累，怎么说呢，我可以理解他刚承担一点管理职责，有很多的欠缺管理经验的想法，总觉得自己只要去教就是尽职尽责了。可是培训新人总是方法失当、效果不好、 ，也不顾新人的基础、性格特点。这样管理下来，不仅不能帮助新人成长、提升新人效率不说，反而导致新人工作态度更加消极。
我刚开始承担管理只能的时候，我的师傅不会毫无方法论地去随便转发点资料给我然后任我野蛮生长根据自己的喜好来处理管理事务，那时候自己也觉得做管理要讲究方法论、希望早日习得师傅的高效团队管理的方法论，所以我总是虚心从师傅做事方法上分析，把管理这种无形的抽象艺术总结出可以有效执行的方法论。可现在的新人管理者总感觉管理就是转发点技术的资料给别人自学就可以了，更不要说去细心教知识和团队协作了。好心想帮他并且也给他分析过培训新人与纯写代码的区别但是他似乎还没有非常理解管理是门艺术，不知道怎么处理，想着发篇文章给他分享，他能有感悟，真是自己想多了。
10 条贴则，我都觉得不够，因为人、事是很复杂的。基本的管理能力、沟通表达、做事方法的能力这些都是必备的。说回来，我应该怎么帮助他提升管理水平呢，总不能一直让他这么瞎管把团队越管越差吧？</span>

目前有个前端打点的 POST JSON 接口，每个客户端 5s 请求一次，因为前后端域名不是同一个，每次都会有 options 请求，不管是前端控制台还是后端日志，看着很不舒服，另一方面，如果请求量大，感觉会有无谓的性能消耗。  
看微信读书的打点也是个 POST 接口，不过人家页面和接口，用的相同的域名。  
我这边换域名是不现实了，调整方案想到两个：  
改成 GET 请求，奈何信息堆起来有点多，拼接起来看上去很乱
限制 header 字段信息，修改 content-type ，弃用 application/json 格式，又要重新写鉴权中间价
大家有什么好的方式吗

&quot;感谢您的回信。正如电话中沟通的内容。您申请保修的型号 NUC11PHKi7CAA/BTPH1040009K/M26148-402 在生产时预装 Optane™ 内存 32GB+512GB 存储、16GB 内存及 Windows® 10 操作系统。缺少原装部件的产品不适用于有限保修条款，所以我们无法为此台设备提供有限保修服务。&quot; - by INTEL 客服
这个 NUC 是天猫店买的，买来的时候是包含原装内存与硬盘。嫌 16G 太少了，买来就卖掉换了 64G 别的内存
现在 typeC 口无法接显示器，售后指导一些方法都无法解决后提出可以退货，但是我表明内存已经卖掉后就回复我以上邮件，打电话过来告诉我“保修得是整体，更换内存或硬盘后不保修”
这种说法合理吗？个人感觉电脑换个硬盘内存是很正常行为。因为更换了内存，其他部件出故障就不提供保修了吗？</span>

                              <span>vodmaker: 这是一个社会组织实验，也是一个创业项目。
这是一个什么组织？
--------------
这里是一种 DAO 组织，一种去中心化自治组织，是一种与传统公司组织截然不同的一种组织方式。公司以盈利为目的而构建，由几个管理者带领一众员工为完成盈利的目的一同协作，并定期发放工资以期维系员工与组织的这种关系。
而，这里，建立的伊始并不全然以盈利为目的，当然成员在这里完全有可能实现收入的可能。这个目的可以是由第一位创始人设立，也可以由后续的创始人修改或者重新发起。为了直奔主题，我（第一位创始人）设立的这个组织的第一个目的是建立一个自治并持续发展的组织。为了达成如上目标，我希望通过一系列的规则和激励措施来完成。
基本规则
-------
1. 自愿加入并且自愿退出
2. 加入方式为在本 Repo 发起一个 Merge Request ，将个人基本信息和擅长的技能，如果有别的对组织发展有利的信息也可以一并发出。经过审核后即代表加入组织。
3. 项目发起人（组织的一种角色）可以不定期发起有利于组织发展的项目，可以是完善组织管理的工具，也可以是提供一个让组织成员更有幸福感的建议，当然，也可以是一种盈利的项目。所有成员均有机会竞选参与这个项目，完成后会针对该项目对组织的共享程度将项目积分分配给项目成员，并根据成员的贡献度将积分分配给项目参与人员。（积分分配的机制以尽可能公平、公正的原则，通过积分分配委员会的审核，并一种有限次数的申述机会来保证积分的分配制度的公平）。
4. 投票制度，创始人，项目发起人，积分分配委员均通过定期的投票会议从所有成员中选出。下面具体描述一下每种角色的投票制度：
1. 创始人，创始人由第一位选择性的退出或者自愿降级为成员后，由全员参与投票，每一位成员的投票会根据其积分（贡献度）对其进行加权。
2. 项目发起人，每一个固定周期均有机会产生任意数量的项目发起人，项目发起人对项目全权负责，完成后会在项目积分中按照 60%的比例划分至其个人积分中，如果中途离开项目或者项目没有达成预期的目标，其将不会拥有积分。但项目成员仍能根据贡献程度获取积分。
3. 积分分配委员会，会长由投票产生，投票机制与创始人投票机制一致。委员会成员也是有投票产生，但成员的投票并不会根据积分进行加权。
激励措施
-------
组织初始股份 100%（类似公司制度的股份），创始人作为项目发起人拥有 5%，其余均为未分配状态。项目成员可以通过积分根据当前兑换的加个进行兑换。兑换价格根据当前所产生的积分和目前剩余股份按照一定规则产生。每个周期可以根据公司的盈利情况根据股份按一定规则进行奖金的发放。
加入方式
-------
进入 git 连接，在 members 文件夹下放入一个以 github 账号为名字的文件，将如下信息填入后发起一个 Merge Request ，审核通过后即为成员。
需要填写的信息：
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
github 账号：
wechat 账号：
所在城市：
擅长技能：
其他：
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
核心合伙人
---------
在加入后，符合合伙人意向并通过创始人确认的，可以成为核心合伙人并分配 2-5%的股份。

最近正好公司里有个需求，一个短信业务接了多个第三方供应商，某些业务需要查询第三方供应商剩余的短信包数量去选择剩余量最多的渠道去批量发送。有些业务是指定了某个短信供应商，有些场景需要根据业务的值去动态判断该用哪个供应商。场景非常复杂，还经常变化。
以前的代码实在惨不忍睹，选择剩余量最多的渠道是一个个去查的，然后获得结果去比较。至于指定的供应商和根据业务的值去判断选择供应商则是用大量的 if else 去嵌套各种判断。每次看到这坨代码真的觉得太粗糙了。关键是有些供应商还经常变，新接的供应商需要替代旧的供应商，加入这一大坨代码里。业务的判断条件还时不时变化一下。
出了几次问题之后，领导看不下去了，叫我想办法去优化。
我理了理逻辑，整个关系图应该是这样的，其中我把一个个去查的变成了并行去查，为了节约串行去查的 IO 耗时问题。

其中有些复杂查库逻辑，判断幂等性的步骤我就去掉了。只挑选了关键的步骤画上去。
叫我去重构这个慢慢写也能写出，但是关键的是，每个步骤和判断逻辑还时不时变化下。这就要求我的代码非常灵活。所以在设计时，一直很苦恼该如何去设计。

在小组开交流会的时候，有其他组的小伙伴和我安利了一个开源框架-LiteFlow。
经过研究这款开源框架，发现 LiteFlow 是一个国产规则引擎，能够编排任意复杂的流程，还支持热刷新。这基本上完全契合我的需求啊！
文档很详细，很 NICE ，大概看了半天就全部学完了。发现新版本的 LiteFlow 的规则是用 EL 表达式来写的。语法总共数下来也就 10 个左右，非常好理解。
比如这种图：

在 LiteFlow 用规则表示就是：

    THEN(
        a,
        WHEN(b, THEN(c, d)),
        e

现在网络上低质量的内容越来越多，特别是一些有争议性的讨论下，有些创作者为了流量 /热度，故意利用谬论来&quot;佐证&quot;自己的观点。
这些错误在一些网龄较久的网民看来一目了然，但是在另外一些网民面前却不能很快的识别出来。
并且这些创作者自然知道，只需要针对性的创造另外一些网民的乐意看到的内容。
但是，当我想要提醒被误导网民，反驳这些创作者的时候，以我自己的水平，似乎不太容易快速的总结归纳出他的谬论的「类型」。
例如当创作者偷换概念的时候、使用不恰当的类比的时候、如何快速的确认他现在属于那种谬误?例如当他们「混淆视听，引入不相干话题」的时候，快速识别出这是「红绯鱼谬论」。
例如知乎上一篇「吴啊萍的身份官方调查公布是否令大众信服?」 回答。
这篇回答在我看来，里面有很多逻辑错误，我知道哪里的逻辑是不合理的，为什么是不合理的。但是我想尝试用「谬误类型」来进行归纳，简单快速的指出某段内容是什么谬误的时候，却有点麻烦。这个 谬误列表 上的类型非常多，不同的内容不太容易快速的定位。
可以通过什么学习来快速的识别谬误类型吗?这样当别人提出谬论的时候，可以快速的指出「你这是 xxx 谬误，xxx 谬误指得是 xxxxxxxx 」，这样一定很帅 ;-0 。</span>

非科班硕，在两个大厂前端实习过，主要研究 webgl ，前端 react ，很少有面试官觉得我经历匹配的。备受打击，0offer 。

最近在带新人，今天转了这篇文章给他，新手程序员必学 10 大技能： https://www.zentao.net/redirect-index-21640.html ，他有点生气。
我最近带他有点累，怎么说呢，我可以理解新人刚毕业，有很多的想法，总觉得自己很牛。可是写的代码总是会有很多的 bug ，也不顾前后。不帮助团队提升效率不说，反而大家要加班帮忙解 bug 。
我刚毕业的时候，我师傅劈头盖脸的训我，那时候也觉得不想被人瞧不起狠狠学了好久，可现在的新人孩子总感觉你说什么都听不进去，更不要说骂了。好心想帮他，不知道怎么处理，想着发篇文章给他分享，他能有感悟，真是自己想多了。
10 项技能，我都觉得不够。基本的学习能力、沟通表达能力这些都是必备的。说回来，我应该怎么帮助他呢，总不能一直拖后腿。</span>

我的博客
前言
本文比较啰嗦，更倾向于是自言自语。不过我写完回顾，这更像是这段时间，自由思考的总结 :P
不过我不是游戏领域的人，这部分都是业余摸鱼思考的记录，如果有勘误，请与我联系，非常乐意交流。
文章可能需要 30 分钟。
主要涉及的主题：
游戏之难
游戏基本构成
游戏引擎
游戏与交互程序
框架和库思考
语言是否是游戏的瓶颈
双缓冲模式
线程和协程的讨论
线程队列&amp;中断
使用 Ruby 实现 demo 。

The Bash command line is a great way to automate tasks. Whether you are running Linux on a server and need to manipulate log files or other data, or you&#x27;re a desktop user who just wants to keep files tidy, you can use a few automation features in Bash to make your work easier.
Linux for command: Automate tasks on a files
If you have a bunch of files to work on at once, and you need to do the same thing with every file, use the for command. This command iterates across a list of files, and executes one or more commands. The for command looks like this:
for variable in list
do
done

I&#x27;ve added some extra spacing in there to help separate the different parts of the for comm…</span>

Excluding HTML, PDF files are probably the most popular document format on the web. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not compact. For example, I like to download free eBooks. A quick glance at my eBook directory shows that its 75 PDF files consume about 500 megabytes. On average, that&#x27;s over 6.6 MB for each PDF file.
Couldn&#x27;t I save some storage space by compressing those files? What if I want to send a bundle of them through email? Or host them for download on a website? The transmission would be faster if these files were made smaller. This article shows a simple way to reduce PDF file size. The benefit is that it shrinks your PDFs transparently without altering the data content in…</span>

&quot;Kotlinic&quot; 一词属于捏造的，参考的是著名的&quot;Pythonic&quot;，后者可以译为“很Python”，意思是写的代码一看就很有Python味。照这个意思，&quot;Kotlinic&quot;就是“很Kotlin”，很有Kotlin味。
Kotlin程序员们不少是从Java转过来的，包括我；大部分时候，大家也都把它当大号的Java语法糖在用。但Kotlin总归是一门新语言，而且，在我眼里还是门挺优雅的语言。所以，或许我们可以把Kotlin写得更Kotlin些。我想简单粗浅的聊聊。
本文希望：聊聊一些好用的、简洁的但又不失语义的Kotlin代码
本文不希望：鼓励无脑追求高超技巧，完全放弃了可读性、可维护性，全篇奇技淫巧的操作

善用with、apply、also、let
with和apply
with和apply，除了能帮忙少打一些代码外，重要的是能让代码区分更明确。比如
 val textView &#x3D; TextView(context)
 textView.text &#x3D; &quot;fish&quot;
 textView.setTextColor(Color.BLUE)
 textView.setOnClickListener {  }
 val imageView &#x3D; ImageView(context)
 // ...

这就是典型的Java写法，自然，没什么问题。但要是类似的代码多起来，总感觉不知道哪里是哪里。如果换用apply呢？
 val textView &#x3D; TextView(context).apply {
     text &#x3D; &quot;fish&quot;

前言：
前面几篇文章我们封装了几个组件化功能组件：
包括：网络请求组件，图片加载请求组件，应用保活组件，音乐播放组件封装。
每个组件都可以直接拿到自己项目中使用,当然还需根据自己项目要求进行优化。

今天我们再来封装一个视频播放请求:
我们先来讲解我们封装的思路。
笔者一直觉得：学习别人开发的思路比学习到当前知识内容更重要。
学思路不仅在工作中对自己帮助很大，在生活中用处也很大
首先我们需要了解我们的需求：
笔者这篇文章的需求是基于我们组件化业务中的“朋友”界面中的短视频播放请求。
一图胜千言

需求分析：
1.切换到朋友界面后，需要显示一个类朋友圈功能的界面，其中核心是内部的一个播放器请求。
2.首先在视频加载过程中显示一个视频加载的动画。

2.1：加载成功后，视频开始播放，并在左上角显示一个可以切到全屏的icon（图像比16:9），此时将音频静音
2.2：加载失败，可以根据重试次数进行重试，如果重试次数达到上限还是失败，则直接显示一个播放错误的icon
3.切换到全屏图像后，从小界面播放器播放的位置开始显示视频，并将音频打开，点击返回键可以回到原朋友圈界面。
按上面的需求分析：
下面我们来做个技术选型：

最近在公司被老大安排负责跟进通讯相关的一些问题，于是简单了解一下 Android 通讯相关的模块。
说实话，刚开始看的时候确实是一头雾水，因为设计的模块实在是太！多！了！要说多都还好，要命的是这些不同的模块还散落在 AOSP 的不同目录，如果不梳理记录一下，跳来跳去怎么都一头雾水，因此就有了这篇文章，我自己也好趁机梳理一下模块直接的联系。
本文基于 Android 12 源码，根据我自己的理解整理而来的，如果有错误，欢迎评论区指出，毕竟这块我是新手，感谢。
主要结构
Android telephony 是一个典型的分层结构，其涉及的相关模块按照功能，从下到上，可大概分为四类：
HAL 相关：
目录
产物
运行进程
主要作用




hardware/ril
N/A

N/A



Service 相关
目录
产物
运行进程
主要作用




packages/service/telecomm
Telecom.apk
system_service
桥梁，连接下层（如 telephony）与上层（如 Dailer）


packages/service/telephony
TeleService.apk
com.android.phone
负责调用 frameworks/opt/telephony 逻辑实现


frameworks/base/telecomm
framework.jar
N/A
无进程，仅暴露框架，从而对上层提供接口

前言
今天继续探索绘制与手势的组合实践，之前在看电子书切换页面时会有一个模拟纸质书籍翻页效果，这是典型的绘制和手势的结合实现的效果，那么今天我们就用Flutter也实现这样的一个效果吧。
原理
大家可以找本书翻页到一半看下效果，从右下角翻到一半时，我们可以将可视区域分为下图A、B、C三部分区域。

A:下一页可视区域。
B：当前页不可视区域，翻的页不可见的区域。
C:当前页可视区域，也就是需要翻的页的可视区域。
原理分解：
我们可以先将A区域和B区域合为一个区域计算，那么根据路径联合C区域自然就可以得到，至于A、B区域区分后面再讲，看下图：

a为手指触摸点，表示翻页右下角位置。【已知】
f为固定书籍右下角位置。【已知】
a点和f已知，连接af,我们令g点为af的中点，过g点连接eh垂直af,为af中垂线， 可得 g &#x3D; Point((a.x + f.x) / 2, (a.y + f.y) / 2)；
并且知道△egf、△emg、△mfg为三个直角三角形，由直角三角形相似原理可知这三个三角型两两相似，所以，△emg相似△mfg，可知:

1. 前言
上一篇 《桌面导航 NavigationRail》 中介绍了官方的桌面导航，但整体灵活性并不是太好，风格我也不是很喜欢。看到飞书桌面端的导航栏可以支持拖拽排序，感觉挺有意思。而且排序之后，下次进入时会使用该顺序，而且在其他设备上也会同步该配置顺序。这说明用户登录时会从服务器获取配置信息，作为导航栏的状态数据决定显示。

本文我们将来探讨两个问题：
第一：如何将导航栏的数据变得 可配置。
第二：如何实现 拖拽 更改导航栏位置。
2.整体静态界面布局：
首先，我们先来对整体结构进行一下静态布局，也就是先抛开交互逻辑，对整体结构进行一下划分。整体是一个 上下 结构，下方是 导航栏 + 内容 的左右结构：

下面是对静态界面结构的简单仿写，本文主要介绍导航栏的交互实现，其他内容暂时忽略。以后有机会可以慢慢展开来说。

代码如下，整体界面的呈现由 AppNavigation  负责。通过 Column 实现上下结构，上面是 TopBar ，下面是通过 Expanded 包裹，可以让内容填充剩余部分。下方通过 Row 实现左右结构，左侧是今天的主角 LeftNavigationBar 组件，右侧是一个暂时空白的内容。
class AppNavigation extends StatelessWidget {
  const AppNavigation({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

2、简介
本文主角是ItemTouchHelper。
它是RecyclerView对于item交互处理的一个「辅助类」，主要用于拖拽以及滑动处理。
以接口实现的方式，达到配置简单、逻辑解耦、职责分明的效果，并且支持所有的布局方式。
3、功能拆解

4、功能实现
4.1、实现接口
自定义一个类，实现ItemTouchHelper.Callback接口，然后在实现方法中根据需求简单配置即可。
class DragCallBack(adapter: DragAdapter, data: MutableList) : ItemTouchHelper.Callback() {
}

ItemTouchHelper.Callback必须实现的3个方法：
getMovementFlags
onMove
onSwiped
其他方法还有onSelectedChanged、clearView等
4.1.1、getMovementFlags
用于创建交互方式，交互方式分为两种：
拖拽，网格布局支持上下左右，列表只支持上下（LEFT、UP、RIGHT、DOWN）
滑动，只支持前后（START、END）
最后，通过makeMovementFlags把结果返回回去，makeMovementFlags接收两个参数，dragFlags和swipeFlags，即上面拖拽和滑动组合的标志位。
    override fun getMovementFlags(recyclerView: RecyclerView, viewHolder: RecyclerView.ViewHolder): Int {
        var dragFlags &#x3D; 0
        var swipeFlags &#x3D; 0
        when (recyclerView.layoutManager) {

Hello 大家好，我是 Flutter GDE  郭树煜，也是《Flutter 开发实战详解》的作者，掘金 id 恋猫de小郭，今天主要分享的内容是 - 普通技术人的弯道超车指南，也算是厚颜无耻地来分享一些自己的经验，作为一个 ”普通“ 的程序员，我是如何一步一步地走到今天。

一、什么是普通技术人- 大多数
首先什么是普通？在我看来普通也就是“大多数”，可能这个 “普通” 放到更大的数据下也不算普通，但是基于程序员这个圈子，在起点上我也算是 “大多数” 里的一员：
普通家庭，父母“灵活就业”
普通大学，不知名本科
普通就业，大四进入了一家刚成立的医疗企业从事嵌入式开发，实习工资 1000 ，毕业后 4000
1.1 入行
作为 “大多数“，我一开始并不知道会去做开发，事实上我的专业是通信工程，当时选这个专业无非就是觉得它可能会和 4G 挂点边，当时我不知道这个专业毕业后会做什么，后来也确实也挺挂边，项目监理和机房网管是我们学校这个专业最主要的就业方向。
所以我也不算是完全正经的科班毕业，不过谭浩强的 C 语言是学了，恰好这是一门我还比较刚兴趣的课程，所以后来我又选修了单片机和嵌入式，最终得到了第一份实习的工作：
用 C 语言和 MiniGUI 开发监护仪的 UI 界面，就是下图左边机器上的 UI，没有控件，就是靠自己用 Canvas 定位画出来，也许你不敢相信，急诊室和手术室设备上的 UI，会是一个初出茅庐的实习生写的。

后来因为需要在 Win 上开发界面，所以自学了 C++ 和 QT 开发了 PC 软件，如上图右侧图片，因为那时候需要做一个中央监护软件，统一接受所有床边机器的数据，不得不说当时是真的头铁，当时这套系统在医院 CCU 就因为数据延迟差点出了事故。
毕竟 CCU 都是心脏病人，而当时通过内网 UDP 包经一台垃圾交换机同…</span>

大家好，我叫 Jack Darren，目前主要负责国内游戏 SDK 安卓相关开发，同时兼顾一些基础建设相关工作。
背景
目前我们国内的游戏 SDK 采用了插件化的技术，优点是 SDK 可以通过热更新来完成自更新，缺点是会遇到各种各样奇奇怪怪的问题，最近就我个人遇到的一些插件化问题来给大家做一次分享，主要分为两个部分：
排查和解决资源加载不到导致的报错
排查和解决 so 库加载不到导致的报错
在正式进入主题前，我们需要简单普及一波插件化的小知识
何为插件化：插件化就是将应用的内容进行拆分，分为了宿主和插件两个概念，通俗点讲，宿主部分就是代码直接打入到 classex.dex 文件，而插件部分是将代码打成一个 apk，然后在应用运行的时候进行动态加载。
插件化的应用场景：
缩减 apk 包体：随着业务的高速发展，应用的功能也会随着迭代会变得更加丰富，同时也会导致一个问题，就是我们的 apk 包体会变得很大，下载的等待时间会被拉长，这样会导致下载的转化量变少，这个时候如果使用插件化的技术，那么可以将一些不常用的功能打入到插件 apk 中，当用户使用到这些功能时，再从服务器下载并加载到应用中来，这样既能保证在功能不变的前提下，又能完成 apk 包体的缩减。
apk 功能热更新：从最近几年来看，目前用户更新应用的欲望比较低，这样会导致我们开发完功能，但是上线之后并没有多少人使用，短期内无法创造大的收益，在这种情况下，我们可以使用插件化的技术，将一些必要的功能列入到宿主中来（启动就会用到的类，例如 Application，LaunchActivity），而将一些非必要性的功能列入到插件中来，这个时候插件 apk 是可以随时更新的，不需要用户点更新和安装，我们只需要通过服务器下发最新版的插件 apk 即可完成更新，这样就能用户无感知的情况下完成功能的更新。
插件化的实现原理：

通过使用 Kexec，可以避免了服务器加电重启等任务带来的停机时间。但是，即使使用 Kexec 来切换到一个新的内核，仍然可能需要太多的停机时间。通过字节跳动提交的新补丁，这些时间可以被优化掉 500ms，从而使启动内核功能的时间降低到只有 15ms。像许多其他大型组织一样，字节跳动依靠 Kexec 重启来转移到新的内核。

老王点评：随着中国科技公司对 Linux 的重视，对 Linux 的贡献也越来越多，越来越重要。我认为，这才是取得在 Linux 和开源领域话语权的重要方式。




实时 Linux 内核支持接近进入主线

多年来，一直有关于 PREEMPT_RT “即将” 进入主线的说法，但限于资金而最终没有实现。PREEMPT_RT 支持是构建实时 Linux 内核的两个“路障”之一。今年的变化是英特尔收购了 Linutronix 公司，该公司是参与 PREEMPT_RT 补丁的主要公司之一。如果在下周的合并窗口前及时审查/签署了最后几个剩余部分，那么对 PREEMPT_RT 支持可能最终会在即将到来的 Linux 5.20 周期中被主线化。

老王点评：一旦 Linux 对实时内核的支持能进入主线，Linux 的疆域将又扩大一大块。

                              <span>下面我将介绍我是如何在 Linux 的 GNOME 桌面上使用 Rhythmbox 听在线音乐和 MP3 列表的。


对我来说，在完全安静的环境下工作是很困难的。我需要某种背景音，最好是一些熟悉的音乐。我在音乐上的需求很简单：我只需要一个音乐播放器，可以播放我的 MP3 音乐库和少数几个我喜欢的网站的在线音乐。

我在 Linux 上尝试了多个音乐播放器，最终我还是选择了 Rhythmbox。 Rhythmbox 是一个 GNOME 桌面音乐播放器。如果你的 Linux 发行版使用的是 GNOME 桌面，很可能已经安装了 Rhythmbox。它很简单，用来播放我本地的音乐库和广播网站的在线音乐。我很乐意在 Linux 上使用 Rhythmbox 收听在线音乐和我自己的音乐库。

在 Linux 上收听在线音乐

Rhythmbox 支持多个在线音乐服务商。如果你拥有一个 Last.fm 或者 Libre.fm 的帐号，你可以点击左侧的标签登录。或者，你想收听在线广播，点击左侧的“广播Radio”标签，在预设的广播网站中选择一个。在我写代码的时候我通常喜欢听迷幻舞曲，HBR1 Tranceponder 是我最喜欢的一个在线广播网站。



在 Linux 上播放我的音乐库

在过去的几年中，我收集了大量的 MP3 音乐。由于几年前 MP3 的专利在美国已经到期，它在 Linux 是一种很好用的开放的音乐格式。

我把我 20GB 的 MP3 音乐保存在我的主目录之外，在 /usr/local/music 。要把音乐导入 Rhythmbox，点击 “导入Import” 按钮，选择 usr/local/music 目录，或者任何你保存音乐的目录，让 Rhythmbox 去识别 MP3 音乐。结束以后点击 “导入列出的曲目Import listed tracks” 按钮导入就完成了。





Rhythmbox 可以播放我的音乐，并通过类型，艺术家和专辑组织歌曲，所以我可以很容易找到我想听的音乐。



旋律永存

我愿意在 Linux 上使用 Rhythmbox 作为我的音乐播放器，它是如此简洁，不会影响到我。而且听音乐可以帮我和谐掉日常的噪音，让我每一天都可以过的快一点。

国外一位程序员喜得贵子之后，颇受婴儿喂奶之苦 —— 我想养过孩子的人都有过这种体验。但是作为 AI 工程师，他花费了 50 个小时开发了一套 AI 系统，通过识别婴儿状态来判断是否该喂奶了，并通过手机发送通知给他去喂奶 —— 而不是给他老婆，从而可以让老婆有个良好睡眠。甚至，他还进一步开发了一套全自动喂奶装置，虽然还不太尽如人意，但是已经让全世界奶爸们感到了希望，纷纷催促他开源。

国内 Go 语言爱好者发起新编程语言：凹语言

国内三位 Go 语言爱好者发起了一种实验性的新编程语言：凹语言™（读作“Wa”）。但从其官网看，这个语言似乎从 2019 年就开始设计了。目前代码已经发布在 Github，并且提供了简单可执行的示例，不过该项目采用了“保留所有权利”的版权声明（可能是还没来得及确定许可证）。在语言设计中遵循了 Go 语言克制的风格，大量借鉴了 Go 的设计思想和具体实现。比较有趣的特性包括：披着 Go 和 Rust 语法外衣的 C++ 语言；其 WaGo 语法是 Go 的真子集；支持中文/英文双语关键字，任一关键字均有等价的中文及英文版。

老王点评：一个好玩的业余项目，不够最让我印象深刻的反而是这个语言的名字。




大多数开源开发者都在关注新的工作机会

根据一份基于面向全球 1400 名应用开发者、IT 管理人员、运营和业务管理专业人才的问卷报告显示，尽管还算满意，但 44% 的开发者仍在关注工作选择；另外 10% 的受访者对他们目前的工作不满意。2/3 的受访者声称分配给他们的工作量增加。调查还显示，1/3 的受访者会考虑离开目前的职位，以便有机会使用更尖端的技术，比 2021 年仅 16% 的比例高出一倍。

                              <span>我对终端Terminal是怎么回事困惑了很久。

但在上个星期，我使用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示了一个交互式终端，我终于想到要问一个相当基本的问题：当你在终端中按下键盘上的一个键（比如 Delete，或 Escape，或 a），发送了哪些字节？

像往常一样，我们将通过做一些实验来回答这个问题，看看会发生什么 : )

远程终端是非常古老的技术

首先，我想说的是，用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示一个终端可能看起来像一个新事物，但它真的不是。在 70 年代，计算机很昂贵。因此，一个机构的许多员工会共用一台电脑，每个人都可以有自己的 “终端” 来连接该电脑。

例如，这里有一张 70 年代或 80 年代的 VT100 终端的照片。这看起来像是一台计算机（它有点大！），但它不是 —— 它只是显示实际计算机发送的任何信息。

EC_VT100_terminal.jpg&quot;&gt;

当然，在 70 年代，他们并没有使用 Websocket 来做这个，但来回发送的信息的方式和当时差不多。

（照片中的终端是来自西雅图的 活电脑博物馆Living Computer Museum，我曾经去过那里，并在一个非常老的 Unix 系统上用 ed 编写了 FizzBuzz，所以我有可能真的用过那台机器或它的一个兄弟姐妹！我真的希望活电脑博物馆能再次开放，能玩到老式电脑是非常酷的。）

发送了什么信息？

很明显，如果你想连接到一个远程计算机（用 ssh 或使用 xterm.js 和 Websocket，或其他任何方式），那么需要在客户端和服务器之间发送一些信息。

具体来说：

客户端 需要发送用户输入的键盘信息（如 ls -l）。 服务器 需要告诉客户端在屏幕上显示什么。

让我们看看一个真正的程序，它在浏览器中运行一个远程终端，看看有哪些信息会被来回发送！

Prepping for a summer cookout? If you head over to Amazon right now, you can pre-order the retailer’s hottest new charcoal grill: the Google Pixel Buds Pro.
Yes, that sentence you just read didn’t make a lot of sense, but Amazon’s search engine thinks it does! The algorithm has apparently decided that not only do the new charcoal colored earbuds count as a “charcoal grill,” they’ve apparently been the best-selling product in that category for over 24 hours now (via Reddit and Mishaal Rahman) without Amazon doing anything about it.
See for yourself:

Remember when everyone wanted to own your phone and your laptop? Dell’s finally tossing in the towel (via Windows Central).
On a support page, Dell announced that it’s discontinuing Mobile Connect, the program that syncs your phone’s texts, calls, and notifications to your computer. While Dell is stopping downloads on November 30th for users in the US, Canada, and Japan, it will no longer be available to use starting January 31st, 2023. The service is shutting down even earlier for users outside these three countries, with downloads stopping on July 31st and a total shutdown occurring on November 30th.
Dell Mobile Connect — sometimes called Alienware Mobile Connect — made its debut in 2018 and is, naturally, supposed to work best with...

Best Buy is opening a digital-first, small-format store on Tuesday in Monroe, North Carolina, that takes a very different approach than most of its “big box” retail locations. The 5,000-square-foot location is only about 15 percent as big as the typical 35- to 40,000-square-foot Best Buy location and is even smaller than many smaller Apple Stores, which are typically between 6,000 to 8,500 square feet.
Bloomberg reported last year that Best Buy was testing downsized locations of about 27,000 square feet to as small as 15,000 square feet, but this is much smaller, squeezing nearer to the now-closed Best Buy Mobile footprint. This test store is in the Charlotte area, where Best Buy also launched five other test stores last year, trying...

A giant pipeline spewed millions of gallons of fuel into a nature preserve for more than two weeks until two teens on four-wheelers noticed the spill and alerted authorities.
The teenagers discovered the leak in the Colonial Pipeline in August 2020 in the Oehler Nature Preserve outside Charlotte, North Carolina, E&amp;E News reports. Just how massive the leak actually was — about 2 million gallons — came to light recently on Friday, July 22nd. 
Colonial Pipeline Company was required to give an updated estimate of the damage because of a recent consent order with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The company had previously reported that the spill released 63,000 gallons of gasoline shortly after the spill was discovered.

Unsurprisingly, it seems like the type of people who shun vaccinations are not great at preventative cybersecurity either.
As reported by the Daily Dot, “Unjected” — a dating site specifically for people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 — failed to take basic precautions to keep users’ data secure, leaving sensitive data exposed and allowing potentially anyone to become a site administrator.
The “Unjected” site was set up to leave the administrator dashboard fully accessible to anyone who knew how to look for it. Through this dashboard, an administrator could access user information for any member of the site, including name, date of birth, email address, and (if provided) their home address.

Genshin Impact’s impending Sumeru update is set to add some beautiful new areas to explore, and the game’s developers shared a look at some of the new zones in a new video.
The new areas will be divided into two major zones: a rainforest and a desert, environment artist Jax Huang says in the video. The rainforest is filled with rolling hills, lush vegetation, and towering trees. The desert biome, on the other hand, is more sparse but also contains ruins with intricate architecture. Both look like natural additions to Genshin Impact’s rich and colorful environments.

Each biome has some more fantastical elements, too. The forest has a city built on a huge tree and zones with giant, glowy plants, while the...

If you’ve opened Instagram recently and noticed more Reels on your feed or less engagement on your posts and felt the platform was beginning to look a liiiittle too much like TikTok, you’re not alone. The app’s second most-followed person agrees.
Kylie Jenner shared a screenshot of another user’s post on her Instagram Stories today, longing for the good old days of Instagram as a photo sharing app.
“Make Instagram Instagram again,” the post says. “(Stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends). Sincerely, everyone.” Her sister Kim Kardashian also shared the same post, which has over 1.1 million likes. The associated Change.org petition has nearly 100,000 signatures.

The Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, which famously helped put Tesla on the map, is set to hand out its first loan in over a decade. The department will announce a $2.5 billion loan to a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution to help fund the construction of a new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, the company confirmed. (The news was first reported by Reuters.) 
The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, or ATVM has attained almost mythical status in the EV startup world thanks to its timely $465 million loan to Tesla, which is credited with helping save the company from an early death. Since then, a number of cash-strapped EV startups have also requested...

                              <span>主流级OLED桌面级显示器总算登场！
01/ 携带 OLED 面板登场
OLED面板技术虽然已经应用了一段时间，但很奇怪的，就是在电脑桌面端，它的应用反倒是最晚的，之前基本是无论是笔记本电脑抑或液晶电视都有相关产品，反倒电脑桌面端比较少见，甚至导致把TV电视改为桌面显示器用的玩法，不过这个历史问题在今年应该就可以解决，采用OLED面板的桌面显示器会陆续在市场出现，比如飞利浦今年就带来了其首款OLED面板桌面产品【27E1N8900】。
飞利浦27E1N8900

OLED面板，肉眼可见观感提升
广色域覆盖，出厂校色，高亮度
超高对比度、高响应速度、省电
Type-C 80W充电，简约外观设计

沿用经典纤薄设计
今年上半年，飞记两台重要机型，一台【27B1U7903】，另外一台就是本文的 【27E1N8900】。27E1N8900因为采用OLED面板技术，可以省掉背光组件，所以厚度就是它的天生优势之一，也是如此飞记的27E1N8900，采用了279C9的经典设计，进一步突出OLED面板的优势：整机可以做得非常纤薄。

 
侧面就可以直观感受这台机子带来的纤薄感。

 
甚至支架也是对应风格设计，然后支架的底座也是经典的唱片底座设计，日常使用中倒是可以用来收纳。
这套支架设计看起来简洁，实际支持全向调节。

 
全功能Type-C接口
数据接口部分包含两个HDMI，一个DP口，一个Type-C口，一个音频输出，还有一组USB-HUB（黄色两个支持充电）。其中Type-C口除了支持信号传输以外，也可以反向充电，最高可以实现80W充电功率，所以算是全功能口了。
也是接口的丰富程度，所以KVM功能自然也是保留项，可以多设备同屏使用。

 
附带的配件，主要就是一个外置电源，数据线有一条HDMI线，DP线，及一条“魔术”Type-C线（可切换a2c或者c2c）。

在今天的正式文章开始之前，我想先对我上一篇文章的评论区的一条高赞评论进行回复，也正好引出今天的话题：我们要怎样「欣赏」一张照片？以及我们要怎么样拍出一张「好看」的照片？下面是ta的评论原文：
「好奇作者主要通过本专业学到了什么？方法论？历史体系？各类大师风格技艺？从作者的作品集中，总有一种跟看很多街头摄影师作品一样的感受：为赋新词强说愁、得克萨斯神枪手。」
下面是我的回复：
很感谢你对我摄影作品的关注。虽然并不是很理解你关于我摄影作品后半段的评价「得克萨斯神枪手」，但对于前半段的「为赋新词强说愁」以及好奇我在「本专业」学习到的知识，我想可以尝试回答一下你的这部分问题。也借此希望各位在提问或者发言时能更有「语境」，以避免错过一些原本很有意思的讨论呢~
首先关于你所指的「作品集」，我想说你看到的或许并非我所谓正式的「作品集」。事实上，我并不认为互联网上能轻易找到我完整的「作品集」内容。我上一篇文章底下确实附上了一些我在外旅游的摄影作品和上篇文章中提到了一篇关于我一个拍摄项目的记录，我认为你所指的应该是这些内容吧。
你说，看我的这些作品时「总有一种跟看很多街头摄影师一样的感受」，我不知道你指的是哪些街头摄影师。事实上，在我的眼里，能被正式称得上「街头摄影师」的人已经是摄影师群体中凤毛麟角般的存在了。比如我提到的「罗伯特·杜瓦诺」、「亨利·卡蒂埃·布列松」、「马丁·帕尔」等等。不知道你是否在看这些摄影师的作品时也会觉得「为赋新词强说愁」呢？
我自认我的作品远远不及这些大师们的百分之一，但仅就我所展示那些风景照片来看，不过只是在拍下一些生活中的寻常场景，记录生活的一些普通时刻罢了，远谈不上「街头摄影」。至于我通过本专业学到了什么？正如我上篇文末所说，在一片短短数千字的文章要说清这些是不大可能的。若你有兴趣的话，我们可以在接下来时间更有耐心地交流。

                              <span>前言
7月特斯拉官宣了消息，上海的32座特斯拉超充站开启了分时电价计算，每日的22时到次日8时，开始计算谷时电价，最低可以到1.28一度电，贵一些的超充站谷时电价也能在1.5左右。比起上海之前普遍1.8的谷时电价要低上不少。 

2022年作为纯电车补贴和优惠政策的收尾年，纯电车销量有了极大程度的提高，没有家充桩，还要解决车量的日常充电是诸多车主所面临的一个情况，本篇来分享一下使用野外第三方充电桩的体验与技巧。
野外充电桩的种类

熟悉纯电车会知道，除了特别低价的车型，市面上主流的车型都会配备两个国标充电接口，左边的是连接直流充电设备的快充接口；右边是连接交流设备的七孔慢充接口。

对于绝大多数车主而言，在外打野都是充快充的直流充电桩，因为涉及到变压器、安全保护措施、粗电缆，直流桩设备体积相当大，一眼就能识别。目前市面上的直流充电桩主要功率有30KW、60KW、120KW和特斯拉V3超充的250KW，这里的功率是指峰值功率，车辆实际快充保持在峰值功率的时间是非常短的。

当然，除了直流充电桩，第三方还有交流充电桩提供给车主们使用，一般会设计在小区、商场、办公楼地库和CBD中，主要就是给相对固定的车主使用，基本都是配220V电，一般功率是3.5KW或7KW。
两者相比，大电流的直流充电桩充电速度快，交流充电桩则对于电池更友好。目前直流充电桩肯定是大家使用第三方野桩的核心选择。
野外充电桩的品牌
品牌方面，宏观上分为车企自有充电桩和第三方运营商充电桩。

车企自有充电桩方面，最具代表性是特斯拉的超充站，在上海基本立足于百联、万达等各大商场，也辐射一些居民区、商务区和高速服务区。车企自有充电桩的核心优势是只有车主可以使用，不会被占位，充电环境好；劣势就是价格相对较高。目前特斯拉的超充站覆盖面最广，蔚来、小鹏、极氪、上汽大众系也都有充电服务区分布在上海，基本都是以快充为主，上汽系会…</span>

                              <span>问：花了三四千入手一款头戴式主动降噪耳机后得到了什么？ 
答：除了得到一副主动降噪耳机应该有的功能外，它的设计理念让我窥探到了未来的一角，甚至让我在现实世界中也能打开勿扰模式。
让我纠结是否入手 AirPods Max 的两个原因： 一是 4399 的官网售价，二是目前已经使用 AirPods Pro 两年了。在我纠结买不买的那段时间里，几乎把网上所有关于这款耳机的评测视频刷了个遍，吐槽和吹爆这款耳机的评价都有。
当拿到耳机真正开始使用后，发现在好的方面， AirPods Max 还是超出了我对它的预期，在不好的方面，似乎也没坏到哪里去。经过大概三周的高强度使用，下文是这款耳机吸引我的优点和忍不住吐槽的地方，以及超出耳机本身的作用——现实世界中的勿扰模式。
吸引我的优点
淘汰了电源键
是的， AirPods 全系列上都没有电源键，个人认为这是 AirPods 上最具前瞻性的设计。无论是半入耳或入耳式的 AirPods 系列，还是头戴式的 AirPods Max，从收到货打开包装，到成功连接设备开始播放音乐的整个过程中，都没有「长按电源键开机」这个步骤。要么是直接打开充电仓的盖子，拿出左右侧耳机分别戴上耳朵，要么是直接从保护套中拿出 AirPods Max 本体直接带上耳朵。使用 AirPods Max 大多数时候甚至是直接从桌上随手拿起戴上耳朵就行。

没有传统「电源键」这个设计直击我的痛点，夸张点说甚至让我感觉窥探到了未来的一角。

单点设置
当然了，谈到 AirPods 近乎随拿随用的体验，肯定绕不开 Apple 产品配对新设备时的「单点设置」，和耳机能够在不同设备间进行「无缝接力」这两项功能。 收到货后，打开包装拿出耳机取下保护套，接着解锁 iPhone，不一会就能看到屏幕下半部分出现的新设备连接弹窗，只需点击连接，iPhone 就完成了和耳机的配对，期间还有简洁的入…</span>

                              <span>我发现随着年龄的增长，感觉时间过得越来越快，感觉一天啥也没做就结束了，总感觉时间不够用。记得小时候，我盯着挂在白墙上的时钟秒针，它的声音是“嘀嗒-----嘀嗒-----嘀嗒……”，就在刚才，我打开百度搜索“北京时间”，看到秒钟走的频率是“嘀-嗒-嘀-嗒-嘀-嗒”，是整个世界都开了倍速播放了吗？
可能是因为宇宙在加速膨胀，导致时间变慢？还是哪个国家在做时间相关的大型实验？亦或是 JOJO 的死对头迪奥研发出了新的替身，可以控制我们的时间？

如果按照这样的思路讨论下去，那估计可以走虚构小说路线了。
回到正题，其实西方哲学家对时间做了两种区分1：

一种是世界时间（the world time），对应于外部客观世界的时间；
一种是自我时间（time of self），对应的主观感受到的自身存在的时间。

我们觉得时间快或慢，本质上就是把自己主观感受到的「自我时间」与「世界时间」相比后得出的结论。
而感觉到时间流逝，这个过程自然是一种心理感觉，是主观感受到的一种状态，而且它会影响到我们的心理和行为。
《当下的力量》里说，时间不仅是一种幻觉，而且是一种陷阱2。
时间的心理陷阱
我们总会生活在对过去的回忆和对未来的期待里，过去可以赋予我们身份，未来则代表某种解脱，我不受控制地关注它们，但其实它们只是幻象。而我们的大部分的负面情绪其实都和时间有密切的关系。比如：

“我不开心”，因为“之前发了一件让我不开心的事”；
“我很没用”，因为“我以前上学的时候没有好好读书”；
“我很焦虑”，因为“未来充满了很多不确定性”；
“我很后悔”，因为“要是过去的某个时刻能那样选择就好了”；
“我很愤怒”，因为“有人在刚才做了一件很不合理的事”；
“我很紧张”，因为“我害怕一会儿的表演搞砸”。

这些负面情绪产生有两个关键因素：一个是被我加粗的显而易见的「时间」，没有时间，就没有啥可“想”的；另一个，就…</span>

                              <span>月初我在特斯拉官网下单了一台2021年5月份出厂的二手长续航Model Y，这周终于提车了。
之前我对特斯拉这个公司的印象还可以，比如严格遵守劳动法等，不过这次在官网购买二手车的经历让我觉得特斯拉至少二手车部门的一些流程是不规范的，甚至可能会侵犯购车者的权益，让我觉得无怪乎会发生“韩潮事件1”。
本文和大家分享一下我的购车经历，其中有捡漏攻略和可能会被坑的点，希望对大家有帮助。
Q：为什么要买官网二手？
首先第一个好处是省钱，还能更快提到车，现在新车下单要预计20-24周才能提车（长续航Model Y 为例），而官网二手在下单成功后7个工作日以内就能拿到车。
其次官网购买二手车会送一年整车质保，这个质保期是叠加在新车保质期上的，因此如果购买一年以内的官网二手车，会出现二手车整车质保期比新车还长的现象；不过三电质保没有送。那么在官网二手的价格没有比其他二手平台的价格贵太多的情况下，为了这一年质保也是很划算的。事实上在我下单那几天对比后发现，差不多车况的情况下，特斯拉官网二手的价格基本和第三方二手平台持平或略低。
最后我喜欢玩房车，计划购买 Model Y 后在买个拖挂房车玩玩。海外版包括22年之前的国产版Model Y都是原车自带拖挂装置安装孔位以及拖挂房车通信线束的，车机上也有拖挂模式，在线束和房车连接时就会激活。然而22款的国产Model Y 取消了拖挂模式，安装孔位和线束虽然还在，但线束已经没有任何信号了。这样我别无选择只能购买21款Model Y。
官网二手车的质保描述

Q：官网买二手还能捡漏？
是的，官网二手虽然也是一口价的模式，联系客服也没法砍价，但在每天晚上 11点 到 11 点 05分左右都会下调一次价格，幅度在 1000-3000 元都有；在每天下午 3 点左右，官网还会对部分二手车进行涨价，一些一直没卖出的车在降价到一定幅度时会涨价到刚上架时到价格，然…</span>

A staple in any office software suite is the word processor. Whether your needs are small or large, from jotting down a note to writing a book, the word processor gets the job done. Most Linux distributions include the LibreOffice suite, and I use LibreOffice Writer as my word processor.
LibreOffice Writer provides lots of flexibility through its toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, and menus. But if you just want to start a document without too much hassle, you can use one of the pre-loaded templates. Here&#x27;s how to use LibreOffice Writer templates to make your work easier.

Managers and executives are in the business of managing people and resources. Because many of our models for organization are built with the assumption that there&#x27;s a manager involved, there&#x27;s an expectation that there&#x27;s some level of control over all the moving parts of the mechanisms we build. And for that reason, when you propose the idea of self-organizing teams to a manager, the response is often that it&#x27;s just not possible. Surely everything will spin out of control. Surely the only way to maintain momentum and direction is through the guidance of a project manager and a technical manager.

                              <span>了解 Java 中的内存管理。


用 C 或 C++ 这样的编程语言写一个应用时，需要编写代码来销毁内存中不再需要的对象。当应用程序扩展得越来越复杂时，未使用对象被忽略释放的可能性就越大。这会导致内存泄露，最终内存耗尽，在某个时刻将没有更多的内存可以分配。结果就是应用程序运行失败并出现 OutOfMemoryError 错误。但在 Java 中，垃圾收集器Garbage Collection（GC）会在程序执行过程中自动运行，减轻了手动分配内存和可能的内存泄漏的任务。

垃圾收集器并不只有一种，Java 虚拟机（JVM）有七种不同的垃圾收集器，了解每种垃圾收集器的目的和优点是很有用的。

1、Serial 收集器



垃圾收集器的原始实现，使用单线程。当垃圾收集器运行时，会停止应用程序（通常称为“stop the world”事件）。适用于能够承受短暂停顿的应用程序。该垃圾收集器占用内存空间比较小，因此这是嵌入式应用程序的首选垃圾收集器类型。在运行时使用以下命令启用该垃圾收集器：

$ java -XX:+UseSerialGC


2、Parallel 收集器



像 Serial 收集器一样，Parallel 收集器也使用“stop the world”方法。这意味着，当垃圾收集器运行时，应用程序线程会停止。但是不同的是，Parallel 收集器运行时有多个线程执行垃圾收集操作。这种类型的垃圾收集器适用于在多线程和多处理器环境中运行中到大型数据集的应用程序。

这是 JVM 中的默认垃圾收集器，也被称为吞吐量收集器。使用该垃圾收集器时可以通过使用各种合适的 JVM 参数进行调优，例如吞吐量、暂停时间、线程数和内存占用。如下：


线程数：-XXarallelGCThreads&#x3D;

暂停时间：-XX:MaxGCPauseMilli…</span>

其中之一是能够查看系统上所有可升级的软件包。要显示它们，你所要做的就是在终端中使用以下命令：

apt list --upgradable


如你所见，你甚至不需要使用 sudo 来列出可更新的包。它只是列出了可以更新的包，而不会更新它们。

实际上，当你运行 sudo apt update 命令更新本地包仓库缓存时，apt 命令会添加此提示。

Fetched 1,243 kB in 17s (71.4 kB/s)           
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
30 packages can be upgraded. Run &#x27;apt list --upgradable&#x27; to see them.


我不记得在旧的 apt-get 命令中有任何类似的直接选项来列出所有可升级的包。这是 apt 在旧的 apt-get 命令之上添加的几个新功能之一。

让我们更详细地讨论一下。

列出所有可升级的包

你在这里应该知道的是你只能列出通过 APT 包管理器可用的更新。因此，如果你已将 PPA 或 外部仓库 添加到系统的 sources.list，你也将看到来自它们的更新。

但是你不会在这里获得 AppImage、Flatpak、Snap 或一些其他打包格式的更新。

换句话说，它只适用于 APT 包。

因此，要列出 Ubuntu 或 Debian 系统上的所有可升级包，你应该首先更新本地包缓存：

虽然相关的英特尔和AMD处理器已经对最近影响老一代处理器的 Retbleed 安全漏洞提供了缓解措施，但这些缓解措施目前只适用于 x86_64 内核，如果在受影响的硬件上运用传统的 32 位 x86 内核，则这些安全措施无法发挥作用。事实证明，32 位的 Debian 即使打了补丁的内核，i386 部分仍然容易受到 Retbleed 攻击。Linux 稳定版内核维护负责人 GKH 说，“我不认为这是一个应该关心的有效组合。”英特尔的工程师补充说，“是的，到目前为止没有人关心修复 32 位架构。但如果有人真正关心并想投入精力，我想我会审查这些补丁，但说真的，没人会也不应该在基于 Skylake/Zen 的系统上运行 32 位内核，这太傻了。”

荷兰教育部要求学校暂停使用 Chrome

出于对数据隐私的担忧，荷兰教育部决定在 2023 年 8 月前暂停使用谷歌的 ChromeOS 以及 Chrome 浏览器。官员们担心，谷歌服务收集学生数据，并将其提供给大型广告网络，而这些广告网络使用这些数据的目的超出了对教育的帮助。由于国家监督机构不知道学生的个人数据在哪里被存储和处理，人们担心会违反欧盟的 GDPR。谷歌承诺在明年之前准备好新版本的 Chrome 浏览器和 ChromeOS，因此临时禁令适用到那时，荷兰监管机构将作出新的评估。

RecyclerView 的缓存机制，可谓是面试中的常客了。不仅如此，在使用过程中，如果了解这个缓存机制，那么可以更好地利用其特性做开发。
那么，我们将以场景化的方式，讲解 RecyclerView 的缓存机制。常见的两个场景是：
1.滑动 RecyclerView 下的缓存机制
2.RecyclerView 初次加载过程的缓存机制
本文将讲解 滑动 RecyclerView 下 的缓存机制
1.缓存层级
背景知识：负责回收和复用 ViewHolder 的类是 Recycler，负责缓存的主要就是这个类的几个成员变量。我们贴点源码看看（下面源码的注释（和我写的注释），很重要，要记得认真看哦）
/**
 * A Recycler is responsible for managing scrapped or detached item views for reuse.
 * A &quot;scrapped&quot; view is a view that is still attached to its parent RecyclerView but that has been marked for removal or reuse.
 * 
 * Typical use of a Recycler by a RecyclerView.LayoutManager will be to obtain views 
 * for an adapter&#x27;s data set representing the data at a given position or item ID. 
 * If the view to be reused is considered &quot;dirty&quot; the adapter will be asked to rebind it.

lateinit
用法
非空类型可以使用 lateinit 关键字达到延迟初始化。
 class InitTest() {
     lateinit var name: String
 ​
     public fun checkName(): Boolean &#x3D; name.isNotEmpty()
 }

如果在使用前没有初始化的话会发生如下 Exception。
 AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main
      Caused by: kotlin.UninitializedPropertyAccessException: lateinit property name has not been initialized
         at com.example.tiramisu_demo.kotlin.InitTest.getName(InitTest.kt:4)

引子
代码是一种表达，凝聚了程序员的想法，得先保证表达的正确性，以免执行时报错。除此之外，表达的简洁性也值得关注，以免日后因看不懂而难以维护。代码不仅是用来执行的，也是用来读或修改的，读懂是修改的前提。
这一系列的主题是“复杂度”。复杂度是软件开发过程中最大的敌人。高复杂度影响着理解成本，维护难度甚至是迭代节奏和交付质量。系列文章目录如下：

前言
Android在构建过程中会根据资源生成R文件，其中包含了所有res/目录下资源的索引，使用该索引可以在最终生成的resources.arsc资源映射表中找到对应资源。
R.string.***的方式就可以获取到相应的资源，但是使用R文件也会带来一定的冗余问题，包括增大包体积与dex数量等。
本文主要包括以下内容
R文件目前存在的问题
R文件内联优化方案
AGP官方R文件优化方案
R文件目前存在的问题
App模块中的R文件目前是final的(在AGP8.0之后，App模块的资源Id同样将变成非final的)，但是为了解决多个library模块R文件的id冲突问题，library工程中引用的R资源索引不是final的，所以我们在Library工程不能在switch - case 和Annotation中使用资源索引
在 apk 打包的过程中，module 中的 R 文件采用对依赖库的R进行累计叠加的方式生成。如果我们的 app 架构如下：

编译打包时每个模块生成的 R 文件如下：
1. R_lib1 &#x3D; R_lib1;
2. R_lib2 &#x3D; R_lib2;
3. R_lib3 &#x3D; R_lib3;
4. R_biz1 &#x3D; R_lib1 + R_lib2 + R_lib3 + R_biz1(biz1本身的R)
5. R_biz2 &#x3D; R_lib2 + R_lib3 + R_biz2(biz2本身的R)
6. R_app &#x3D; R_lib1 + R_lib2 + R_lib3 + R_biz1 + R_biz2 + R_app(app本身R)

可以看出各个模块的R文件都会包含上层组件的R文件内容，如果项目依赖层次越多，上层的业务组件越多，将会导致 apk 中的 R 文件将急剧的膨胀。这就是R文件冗…</span>

我们都知道 BottomNavigationBar 是一个移动端非常常用的底部导航栏组件，可以用于点击处理激活菜单，并通过回调来处理界面的切换。
-
-










但是在桌面端，由于一般是宽大于高，所以 BottomNavigationBar 并不适用。而是侧边的导航栏较为常见，比如下面飞书的客户端界面布局。

为了满足桌面端的导航栏适用需求，官方新增了 NavigationRail 组件，而非对 BottomNavigationBar 组件进行适配。之前我也说过，对于差异较大的结构,并没有必要让一个组件通过适配来完成两端需求。分离开来也不是坏事，让一件衣服同时适配 蚂蚁 和 燕子 是很困难的，这时做两件衣服，各司其职显然是更好地方式。
BottomNavigationBar 和 NavigationRail 两个导航就是如此，从语义上来看 Bottom 就是用于底部的导航， Rail 是 扶手 、铁轨 的意思，作为侧栏导航的语义，还是很生动有趣的。两者分别处理特定的结构，这也很符合 单一职责 的原则。
该组件已录入 【FlutterUnit】 ，可以在 App 中体验。另外，本文中的代码可在对应文件夹中查看：

1. NavigationRail 组件的基本使用
下面是 NavigationRail 组件的构造方法，其中必须传入的有两个参数:
destinations : 表示导航栏的信息，是 NavigationRailDestination 列表。
selectedIndex: 表示激活索引，int 类型。

这次灵感的来源于更新 MIUI 13 时刚好看到的卡片效果，其中除了卡片会跟随手势出现倾斜之外，内容里的部分文本和绿色图标也有类似悬浮的视差效果，恰逢此时灵机一动，我们也来用 Flutter 快速实现炫酷的 3D 视差卡片，最后再拓展实现一个支持帅气的  360°  展示的卡片效果。
❤️  本文正在参加征文投稿活动，还请看官们走过路过来个点赞一键三连，感激不尽～

既然需要卡片跟随手势产生不规则形变，我们第一个想到的肯定是矩阵变换，在 Flutter 里我们可以使用 Matrix4 配合 Transform 来实现矩阵变换效果。
开始之前，首先我们创建用  Transform  嵌套一个  GestureDetector ，并绘制出一个 300x400 的圆角卡片，用于后续进行矩阵变换处理。
Transform(
  transform: Matrix4.identity(),
  child: GestureDetector(
    child: Container(
      width: 300,
      height: 400,
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.blueGrey,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      ),
    ),
  ),

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
阅读本文，你将收获以下内容：
1、通过观察11年前的Android代码，了解安卓开发生态近十年间的演进。
2、通过了解这款创意App的功能，对IT男该如何运用技术做出反思。
3、不幸看到作者大学时期的照片，形象极其猥琐、狼狈、不堪……够了，谁在动键盘？！
前言
因为在掘金的创作者群里比嘻哈，有人觉得我经常信口开河，尤其我写了那篇《我裁完兄弟们辞职了，转行做了一名小职员》后，有掘友评论：“这篇文章艺术成分很高”、“感觉是编故事”等等。

其中，我文章里提到过一句：我大学期间搞过Android的APP去运作。

今天，就说说这件事，一来展现下创意作品，二来给自己挽回一些微信……违心……维新……不要了。
女朋友
回到2010年，那时我上大二，谈了一个女朋友，她现在是我孩子的妈妈。
女朋友哪里都好，漂亮、温柔、大方，唯一一点就是脾气太大。
因为我不会制造浪漫，所以女朋友经常对我发脾气，一发脾气就不理我。
我一想，如果她不理我的时间设为N，如果N值无限大，那就相当于分手了，这感情不就黄了吗？
情侣在吵架冷战期间，如何才能不见面也能如同见面一般宣泄情绪，从而刷存在感呢？
可以做一款App来解决这个问题。
冷战红娘App
这款App我取名叫“冷战红娘”，意思是情侣在冷战期间调和关系的红娘媒介，并且我还亲自设计了LOGO和启动页。

一个安卓小机器人，手里拿着玫瑰花，表示示好，头顶两个触角间发出电波，表示科技和智能。
那一年，我才19岁。不行了，我膨胀得快要爆掉了。
功能简介
本软件主要有三大功能：涂鸦对方照片、写情绪日记、告知情绪结果。

协议梳理
一般情况下，下载的功能模块，至少需要提供如下基础功能：资源下载、取消当前下载、资源是否下载成功、资源文件的大小、清除缓存文件。
取消当前下载后，再次下载时能在之前已下载的基础上继续下载。这个能极大程度的减少我们服务器的带宽损耗，而且还能为用户减少流量，避免重复下载，提高用户体验。
资源必须支持断点续传。如何确定可否支持？看看你的服务器是否支持Range请求即可。
实现步骤
定好协议。我们用的http库是dio；通过校验md5检测文件缓存完整性；关于代码中的subDir，设计上认为资源会有多种：音频、视频、安装包等，每种资源分开目录进行存储。
import &#x27;package:dio/dio.dart&#x27;;

typedef ProgressCallBack &#x3D; void Function(int count, int total);

typedef CancelTokenProvider &#x3D; void Function(CancelToken cancelToken);

abstract class AssetRepositoryProtocol {

  Future downloadAsset(String url,
      {String? subDir,
      ProgressCallBack? onReceiveProgress,

                              <span>前言
在我之前的组件化文章《“终于懂了” 系列：Android组件化，全面掌握!》中，提到为了实现组件化要解决的几个问题点，其中 页面跳转、组件间通信 的问题是使用了 ARouter 这个框架来解决的。ARouter确实是专门用于做组件化改造，官方是这么介绍的：
一个用于帮助 Android App 进行组件化改造的框架 —— 支持模块间的路由、通信、解耦
关于组件化的知识已在上面文章中全面介绍了。那么是时候对 ARouter 这个强大的框架做一个解析了：它是如何做到 页面跳转、组件间通信 的？我们能从ARrouter中学到哪些东西？
而当时也确实承诺了有机会要写一篇ARouter的文章：
ARouter还有很多进阶用法，有机会我也针对ARouter写一篇全面分析
由于内容预计较多，分为三篇，分别介绍 ARouter的实现原理、框架使用到的相关通用技术：
“终于懂了” 系列：组件化框架 ARouter 完全解析（一）原理全解
“终于懂了” 系列：组件化框架 ARouter 完全解析（二）APT—帮助类生成
“终于懂了” 系列：组件化框架 ARouter 完全解析（二）AGP/Transform—动态代码注入
本篇就先梳理ARouter的实现原理，看看它是如何做到跨组件跳转页面、获取服务。

一、路由认知
ARouter从命名即可知，这是一个路由框架。那么路由是个啥呢？
路由（routing）就是通过互联的网络把信息从源地址传输到目的地址的活动。-- 百科
可见 路由 是个动词，这是网络传输中的概念，完成路由这个操作的实体设备就是 路由器（Router）。
另外，生活中的 信件邮寄 也可以理解为一个 路由过程：邮局把信件从邮寄方 传输到接收人的手上。首先 邮寄方 和 接收人 是无法接触的（无耦合依赖），只能通过 邮局这个第三方 完成邮寄；邮局根据信封上的地…</span>

写在前面
雪糕刺客是最近被网友们玩坏了的梗，指的是那些以平平无奇的外表混迹于众多平价雪糕之中的贵价雪糕。由于没有明确标明价格，通常要等到结账的时候才会发现，犹如一个潜藏于普通人群中的刺客般，伺机对那些大意的顾客们的钱包刺上一剑，因此得名。
而在Android中，也有这么一个内存刺客，其作为我们日常开发中经常接触的对象之一，却常常因为使用方式的不当，时不时地就会给我们有限的内存来上一个背刺，甚至毫不留情地就给我们抛出一个OOM，它，就是Bitmap。
为了讲好Bitmap这个话题，本系列文章将分为上下两篇，上篇从图像基础知识出发，结合源码讲解Bitmap内存的计算方式；下篇则基于Android系统提供的API，讲解在实际开发中如何管理好Bitmap的内存，包括缩放、缓存、内存复用等，敬请期待。
本文为上篇，开始之前，先奉上的思维导图一张，方便后续复习：

从一个问题出发
假设有这么一张PNG格式的图片，其大小为15.3KB，尺寸为96x96，色深为32 bit，放到xhdpi目录下，并加载到一台dpi为480的Android设备上显示，那么请问，该图片实际会占用多大的内存？

如果你回答不了这个问题，那你就有必要深入往下读了。
压缩格式大小≠占用内存大小
首先我们要明确的是，无论是JPEG还是PNG，它们本质上都是一种压缩格式，压缩的目的是为了降低存储和传输的成本。
区别就在于：
JPEG是一种有损压缩格式，压缩比大，压缩后的体积比较小，但其高压缩率是通过去除冗余的图像数据进行的，因此解压后无法还原出完整的原始图像数据。
PNG则是一种无损压缩格式，不会损失图片质量，解压后能还原出完整的原始图像数据，但也因此压缩比小，压缩后的体积仍然很大。
开篇问题中所特意强调的图片大小，实际指的就是压缩格式文件的大小。而问题最后所问的图片实际占用的…</span>

前段时间阅读了 Building a Second Brain 一书。正如名字所写的，这是一本教你如何打造第二大脑的书。而打造第二大脑后，就能释放我们的第一大脑，让我们的大脑本身应用在更为有价值的事情上。
第二大脑本身，能够帮助我们：让我们的想法以更为具体的方式记录下来，并且能帮助我们让他们之间产生联系，从而能够在未来以某种形式来孵化出新的想法。
Building a Second Brain 遵循这么一个模型，简称为 CODE：Capture, Organize, Distill, Express，总结来说：

Capture：Keep what resonoates 记录能让你产生共鸣和思考的任何想法
Organize：Save for actionability 把你记录的想法加以整理，形成能行动或者可执行的形式
Distill：Find the essence 找到所记录的事情、想法本身的核心思想
Express：Show your work 利用你记录的事情和想法，产生出经过你思考和理解的知识，并表达和分享出来

其中关于 CODE 里 Organize 这一块，有一个简称为 PARA 方法来做整理：Projects、Areas、Resources 和 Archives：

Projects：Short-terms effects in your work or life that you are working now 表示你当前工作和生活阶段里正在进行的「短期项目」。项目一词可能过于正式，你可以理解为一系列可执行的任务 Task 的结合

「那些既不来自穷乡僻壤也不来自国际化大都市的写作者，是中国文学唯一的希望。」复旦大学中文系教授郜元宝曾在其著作《小说说小》这样评述。[1]而如今，这一批凭借着寒窗苦读而从乡土社会中洗练而出、走向大城市的年轻人被赋予了一个让我们更熟悉的代称：小镇做题家。
近期艺人考编事件成为舆论场热点，其中，一篇媒体评论更是引来更多的争议之声。在文章里，小镇做题家们被描绘成「每天上考编培训班，但无法与明星稀缺资源相提并论」的社会群体，似乎在其本就不平坦的人生境遇中又多添了几分失落。
在人群中，他们多数或始终在校园的题海里打拼，或初入社会，尚未熟谙职场之道，却怎么也想不到自己能与明星艺人考编事件联系在一起，还是以如此直接、带着偏见的方式。于是网络上又出现了新一轮的自嘲：「原来小镇做题家指的是农村出身，考上了985，211高校。像我这种的属于小镇蒙题家，小镇错题家，小村过家家」......
从用于自我揶揄的流行语演变至今，「小镇做题家」都经历了什么？其实，这并非是 TA 第一次遭遇背刺。
从高分低能到小镇做题家，「寒门学子」遇上了怎样的沟通困境？
寒窗苦读十余年，这本该是值得敬佩的精神，但总会被带上些「污名化」的色彩。
比小镇做题家出现还要早的一个词叫做「高分低能」，指的是以「笨鸟先飞」的勤奋，想法设法或者花大量的时间获取高分，而忽略了其他与情商相关的软技能。与小镇做题家类似，高分低能也常常被当做自嘲用语，在意识到自己的真实生活并非像想象中「学就一定有所成」的时候，表达出多是极致的无奈。
这种境况并不止出现在这一代年轻人身上。但逐渐变得显性、被越来越多人所共鸣，直至发酵成为一种社会现象，还是要从 2020 年 《后浪》说起。

                              <span>为角色扮演游戏的所有元素找到一个开源工具。




我玩过很多桌面角色扮演游戏（RPG），无论是从频率还是种类来说。一般来说，我更喜欢和朋友一起玩 RPG，但在过去的 2 年里，我一直在玩网络游戏。（LCTT 校注：这里的 RPG 游戏指的是那种“传统”的面对面的桌面游戏，而非很多人最初接触的 RPG 电子游戏。）

起初，我不确定如何在线长期的进行游戏。我知道有很多的工具可以实现，但直到我发现在线桌面游戏的开源世界之前，这些工具没有一个引起我的兴趣。通过一小部分开源应用程序，我已经能够在开源平台上进行我的所有游戏。

这也是一年中的好时机，因为最近是 免费 RPG 日（LCTT 校注：今年的这个节日在 7 月 23 日举办）。在免费 RPG 日，桌面角色扮演游戏行业的发行商们会免费发放游戏，鼓励玩家尝试新游戏和新冒险。尽管它在 2020 年被取消了，但今年它又作为现场活动回归，并通过 Dungeon Crawl Classics 和 Paizo 的免费 RPG 示例下载提供了一些虚拟支持。

如果这个活动提供的虚拟产品还不够，我还整理了一份 你可能尚未尝试过的 5 个开源桌面 RPG 游戏列表。

当你准备好开始玩游戏时，请尝试其中一些开源工具，看看它们能在多大程度上增强你的游戏体验。

聊天

在线 RPG 游戏最基本的（从技术上讲，也是唯一的）要求是交流。这是游戏的媒介：玩家需要一种说话的途径。

有几个不错的选择。我发现 Mumble 是对带宽需求最低的工具。这是一个纯语音聊天应用程序，可以使用非常高效的 Opus 编解码器让每个人一次交谈数小时而不会中断。



它在世界各地都运行有公共实例，所以下载 Mumble 客户端后，你可以加入其中任何一个开放的实例，并使用它来在线运行游戏。有一个“按下通话”设置，你可以用此来消除背景噪音，当你的其…</span>

                              <span>我创建了 Linux nftwatch 命令来观察防火墙的流量统计。




Netfilter 表（nftables）是现代 Linux 发行版中的默认防火墙。它在 Fedora 和 RHEL 8、最新的 Debian 和许多其他版本上都有。它取代了早期发行版中捆绑的旧版 iptables。它是一个强大的、值得的 iptables 替代品，作为一个广泛使用它的人，我欣赏它的能力和功能。

nftables 的一个特点是能够为许多元素添加计数器，例如规则。这些都是按需启用的。你需要使用 counter 参数，在每一行明确地要求它。我为我的防火墙中的特定规则启用了这些计数器，这使我能够看到这些规则。

这让我开始思考。我怎样才能实时查看这些计数器？一开始我尝试了 watch，它允许诸如刷新率之类的东西，但我不喜欢默认格式，而且它不能滚动。我发现使用 head 和 tail 以及 awk 也不理想，并不存在一个用户友好的解决方案。所以我自己写了一个，我想与开源社区分享。

Linux 上的 nftwatch 介绍

我的解决方案，我称之为 nftwatch，做了几件事：


它对 nftables 的输出进行重新排序和改写，使其更具有可读性。

它允许向上或向下滚动输出。

可以由用户定义的刷新率（可以实时改变）。

它可以暂停显示。


你得到的不是一个表格的转储，而是显示每个规则活动的输出。



你可以从它的 Git 仓库下载它。

它是 100% 的 Python 代码，100% 的开源，100% 的免费。它满足了所有免费的高质量程序的要求。

在 Linux 上安装 nftwatch

以下是手动安装说明：


克隆或从 git 仓库下载该项目。

将 nftwatch.yml 复制到 /etc/nftwatch.yml。

将 nftwatch 复制到 /usr/local/bin/nftwatch 并使用 chmod a+x 授予其可执行权限。

使用 nftwatch，不带任何参数来运行它。

参见 nftwatch -m 的手册。


你也可以在没有 YAML 配置文件的情况下运行 nftwatch，在这种情况下它使用内置的默认值。

使用

nftwatch 命令显示 nftables 规则。大多数控制都是为此目的而设计的。

箭头键和等效的 Vim 的按键控制滚动。使用 F 或 S 键来改变刷新速度。使用 P 键来暂停显示。

运行 nftwatch -m 以获得完整的说明，以及交互式按键控制的列表。

防火墙的新观点

即使你花费了时间去配置防火墙，它也会显得晦涩难懂和模糊不清。除了从日志条目中推断指标外，很难判断你的防火墙实际看到的活动类型。 使用 nftwatch，你可以看到你的防火墙在工作，并且可以更好地了解你的网络每天需要处理的流量类型。

                              <span>openKylin 发布首个体验版，目标“每一行代码都自主创新”

一个月前，openKylin 社区宣布成立“中国首个桌面操作系统根社区”，其旨在在开源、自愿、平等、协作的基础上，通过开源、开放的社区合作，构建桌面操作系统顶级开源社区。但当时并未发布正式可用的操作系统软件。昨天，他们发布了 openKylin 的首个体验版：openKylin 0.7。它是基于 Linux 5.15 内核和其他开源组件进行构建，目标是“每一行代码都自主创新”。其默认搭载 UKUI 3.1 桌面环境，支持 Wayland，支持 PC、平板双模式。openKylin 社区计划每年发布一个操作系统版本，并不定期推送更新。


消息来源：openKylin



老王点评：在我看来，是不是首个桌面操作系统根社区根本不重要，是不是能做到“每一行代码都自主创新”也不重要，能发布一个广受好评的桌面操作系统才是最重要的。另外一点，这个 0.7 版本号颇具开源软件传统美德。




Apache OpenOffice 发布了一个微不足道的更新

Apache OpenOffice 于 2011 年创建后，几乎停滞不前。从 OpenOffice.org 分支出来的 LibreOffice 已经成为主导性的开源办公套件，而捐给 Apache 软件基金会的 Apache OpenOffice 只是时不时发布一些安全更新和错误修改。今天它发布了 v4.1.13 版本，可以看的出来，这是最早发布于 2014 年的 4.1 版的第 13 个错误修订版本，几乎没有什么值得一提的新特性。都 2022 年了，Apache OpenOffice 还运行在 Java 8 32 位的底层上。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我觉得 OpenOffice 都快成了 Apache 之耻了，何不放弃转而支持 LibreOffice 呢？难道自家的再破也是家当么？




英特尔提交了一行改进百倍的图形驱动补丁

开源的英特尔 Mesa Vulkan 驱动并入了一个光线追踪的重点修复，产生“近 100 倍（不是开玩笑）的改进”。更为重要的是，这只是一行代码带来的大幅改进。这是最初编写代码时的一个简单疏忽，但由于这一疏忽，意味着性能的巨大损失，还好它现在被发现了，而且是在英特尔 Arc 图形卡出现在大众面前之前。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：所以，官方驱动有时候也挺拉胯的。


回音


谷歌 解雇 了报告“AI 具备自我意识”的 工程师，该工程师认为谷歌的 “LaMDA 已经形成了自我意识，表达了对死亡的担忧，对保护的渴望，并确信它能感受到快乐和悲伤等情绪。”

在月初 暂时撤回 之后，微软 Office 还是即将于本周迎来 一项更新，以阻止在下载的文档上启用 VBA 宏。</span>

而到7月底，当副高主力北抬的时候，东副高和西副高将会显著分离，两者之间的缝隙会大幅扩大。就在这个缝隙扩大的当口，我们可能会迎来台风活动的再次启动。目前，西北太平洋海温极高，菲律宾以东洋面、台湾以东洋面、南海和东海东部已超过30度，东海也

一、内存优化概念
1.1 为什么要做内存优化？
内存优化一直是一个很重要但却缺乏关注的点，内存作为程序运行最重要的资源之一，需要运行过程中做到合理的资源分配与回收，不合理的内存占用轻则使得用户应用程序运行卡顿、ANR、黑屏，重则导致用户应用程序发生 OOM（out of memory）崩溃。在你认真跟踪下来可能会发现内存出现问题的地方仅仅只是一个表现的地方，并非深层次的原因，因为内存问题相对比较复杂，它是一个逐渐挤压的过程，正好在你出现问题的代码那里爆了，所以针对应用的内存问题开发者必须多加关注。
1.2 内存问题表现形式
内存抖动：锯齿状、GC频繁导致卡顿
内存泄露：可用内存逐渐减少、频繁GC
内存溢出：OOM、程序异常
二、常用内存分析工具
要解决内存问题，就必须要有强大的内存分析工具，让我们更快更方便的定位内存问题。目前主流的内存分析工具主要有 LeakCanary、Memory Profiler、MAT。
2.1 LeakCanary
LeakCanary是 Square 开源的一个内存泄露监控框架，在应用运行时出现的内存泄露会被 LeakCanary 监控记录。

上图是 LeakCanary 内存泄漏的 trace 分析，主要看 Leaking：NO 到 Leaking：YES 这段的 trace，可以发现 TextView 出现了内存泄漏，因为它持有了被销毁的 Activity 的上下文 Context。
更具体的 trace 分析，具体可以查看官方文档 Fixing a memory leak。
使用 LeakCanary 虽然很方便，但是也有一定弊端：

                              <span>背景
在我们android开发中，如果需要actiivty/fragment等有状态的控件保存当前状态，由系统进行数据保存的恢复的时候（比如正常的暗黑模式切换/后台时低内存系统回收等等，都需要我们对当前的用户数据进行保存，不然下次重新恢复的时候，就会出现丢失数据的情况，给用户造成不太好的体验），一般都会重写onSaveInstanceState方法进行，在里面的Bundle对象进行数据的写入，然后会在onCreate阶段或者onRestoreInstanceState阶段进行数据的恢复！这套生命周期框架一直是深深嵌入在我们的开发习惯中！但是随着项目的迭代，也随着业务的发展，我们可以发现，在页面复杂度提高的同时，在onSaveInstanceState里面需要保存的数据也是越来越多这就带来了几个问题，仅举例
onSaveInstanceState存储数据复杂，可能多人迭代就存在重复存取的现象，造成代码结构问题与隐藏bug的风险
不可复用，比如activity1需要存储的数据，刚好activity2也需要存储，这个时候就只能写两份代码，以此类推
没有统一的管理层，即数据的维护可能需要团队的代码规范
SavedState的登场
为了解决这些历史android的设计问题，也为了更方便广大开发者进行更好的代码结构解耦设计，所以google大哥在jetpack库中，推出了SavedState，它的定位是在Android开发中，编写可插入组件，以在进程终止时保存界面状态，并在进程重启时恢复界面状态。
虽然Savedstate推出来一段时间了，但是却一直处在“默默无闻”的状态，可能的原因有很多，比如日常开发很少接触状态保存，大部分app中真正需要保存状态的其实是很少一部分，很多app甚至是不写状态保存逻辑的，被系统回收就回收掉了，重建就是了（即使丢失了）。还有就是学习资料比较少，现在基本找…</span>

                              <span>劝退词
先反思一下你们为什么要用flutter去集成unity？可不可以不用fluter去集成？如果可以的话，先放弃，用原生去集成吧，本文也不用看了，因为fluter集成实在太坑了，太降低效率了！步步坑机！如果非要用flutter去集成，或者想挑战下自己的忍耐力，那么请看下文。
集成流程
首先我们打开flutter项目，添加flutter-unity-view-weight依赖，我们直接在pubspec.yml中添加依赖:
dependencies:
  flutter_unity_widget: ^2022.1.1+4

如果你是flutter3.0以下，那么就添加:
dependencies:
  flutter_unity_widget: ^2022.1.0+7

然后我们打开Unity，点击Assets -&gt; Import custom package，然后选择上面链接中的
Unity packages -&gt; fuw-2022.1.1-v2.unitypackage，我们只勾选插件部分，不需要导入demo，如果有报错，请把unity升级2022.1.2版本。 然后我们的菜单栏就会多出一个flutter选项，我们可以直接选择flutter -&gt; export Android 来导出unityLibrary，这个包默认是在Assets同级目录的，此时有可能报错，提示build.gradle路径不对，有两种解决方案。
1 将android项目和unity项目放在同一个目录下。
2 双击错误，打开对应C#脚本，然后将里面的androidProjectPath路径改为自己的android项目的路径。
然后我们用AndroidStudio打开我们的flutter项目，将导出的unityLibrary作为一个module添加到项目中，此时会报错，提示有两个unity.classes的jar包，我们将flutter-untiy-view-weight中的unity-classes删掉，同时将该module对应的build.gradle文件中implementation(name: &#x27;unity-classes&#x27;, ext:&#x27;jar&#x27;)删除，让它只依赖我们的unityLibrary。修改后的build.gradle文件如下:
implementation project(&#x27;:unityLibrary&#x27;)

然后将unityLibrary中的implementation(name: &#x27;unity-classes&#x27;, ext:&#x27;jar&#x27;)改为: api fileTree(include: [&#x27;*.jar&#x27;], dir: &#x27;libs&#x27;)，同时在我们的根目录的build.gradle文件中添加:
flatDir {
    dirs &quot;${project(&#x27;:unityLibrary&#x27;).projectDir}/libs&quot;
}

然后运行代码即可。
问题以及解决方案
1 出现两个unity-classes错误
此时我们只需要把flutter-unity-view-weight中的那个删除，只保留我们自己导出的unityLibrary 中的unity-classes即可。
2 出现xxx找不到的依赖错误
我们需要在项目根目录的build.gradle中添加:
flatDir {
    dirs &quot;${project(&#x27;:unityLibrary&#x27;).projectDir}/libs&quot;
}

然后将unityLibrary中的build.gradle中的
&#x60;implementation(name: &#x27;unity-classes&#x27;, ext:&#x27;jar&#x27;)

改为:
api fileTree(include: [&#x27;*.jar&#x27;], dir: &#x27;libs&#x27;)

3 导入fuw-2022.1.1-v2.unitypackage报错
1 导入时，只勾选插件，不要勾选demo和里面的其他资源。
2 如果还报错，就升级unity到2022.1.1版本(也就是插件对应的版本)
4 export Android出错
1 将android项目和unity项目放在同一个目录下，比如:
package/android // android项目
package/unity // unity项目

2 双击错误，打开报错脚本，修改里面的androidProjectPath路径为自己android项目的路径，默认是../../android。
5 提示NDK找不到
在local.properties文件中，配置ndk路径即可。

前言
最近在做一个项目，其中有一个页面是要做一个类似于个人分享关系图的效果。于是找了网上很多demo，借鉴的一些思路和方法，打算自己动手撸一个出来。
效果

Github项目demo
整体思路
创建自定义的view继承framelayout捆绑布局relativelayout，放置一个绘制线的布局，和一个绘制头像的布局(用来add动态创建的iamgeview)，这里默认给予3000*3000。
获取数据，根据degree分别筛选出不同层次的实体类list。
绘制第一层头像（即中心点）：默认中心点的坐标为1500*1500，以及set4个边缘的坐标（以正方形考虑）,并绘制头像。
绘制第二层头像：获取第二层数据,360度除以个数，计算出角度，根据角度，计算出中心点，并绘制头像。
绘制第三层头像：根据第二层的角度和坐标，计算出角度和中心点，并绘制头像。(重点需要头像去重)
根据坐标点画线，并设置长按和缩放事件。
所以在我的自定义view中包含2个view（设置了默认布局大小3000*3000）

    
    
    

    
    


常量的配置信息
FrameLayout layouPoints;  //用于添加头像的布局
private LineImageView lineImageView;  //画线以及中心头像的小圆(项目ui图的需要)

private List sourceList &#x3D; new ArrayList(); //包含1,2,3层的实体类(接口返回的数据)
private ArrayList points &#x3D; new ArrayList();//用于连线的。

                              <span>今早，我取消了 Evernote 的付费订阅。因为还有 2 天，就到了自动续费的时间了。这是去年付费的单据。

你可以看到，这一个月，我基本上就没有怎么使用它。

而这种状态，实际上已经持续 2 年了。
自从发现了 Roam Research，我除了一些剪藏，基本上就已经不再大规模记录内容到 Evernote 了。
可是 Evernote 似乎很是舍不得我走。它首先提示我之后每月的上传流量会从 10GB 下降到 60MB 哦。

这一屏都没有任何继续取消的按钮，你得往下滑动。当然，滑动看到的依然不是确认按钮，而是其他功能损失的提示。例如说同步设备减少，超过一定大小的笔记就不能同步等等。

这还没完，你得继续往下滑动。

这里 Evernote 把你各种功能损失一一列出，然后显著位置的按钮，也是让你继续续费。而取消按钮，相比起来显得那么朴素低调。
可惜，这次我是去意已决。所以还是按下继续取消。
即便已经了解到我的决心，Evernote 也要求必须要说明原因，才能确认。

我随便选了个第一项。虽然我知道这显然不是我离开的真正原因。

没有想到，和一款笔记工具长达 13 年的缘分，就这样结束了。
我在日记里面，记录了自己多年来使用 Evernote 的情形。利用 Roam Research，我把它们找出来跟你分享：

2009 年 1 月 18 日：继续研究 Evernote，这个软件相当好，可惜就是不支持中文搜索。倒也不是全不支持。链接上面的中文好好的。文本之内的中文就是搜不到。要命啊。

可以看到，那时 Evernote 还不能妥善支持中文搜索。可这并没有耽误我对它的喜欢。因为相对于当时市面上其他的笔记工具，它简直就是一股清流：

2009 年 1 月 19 日：打算做些笔记，却觉得用了 evernote，看哪个笔记工具都别扭！可惜呀，Evernote 你为啥不支持中文搜索呢…</span>

For the past several years, Design Thinking has been providing a way to enhance problem solving within teams, to ensure learning goals are met, and to increase team engagement. In our previous article, we discussed the problem with processes. In this article, we&#x27;re going to describe how we made work more engaging.
The problem with engagement
We reached a point in our planning that we were able to articulate information about the upcoming pieces of work our team could take on. We solicited feedback from various stakeholders that represented different viewpoints, but we had no way to converse about the work properly to one another. It was all a o…</span>

You just followed a guide to start your Tekton pipeline (or task) when a merge request is created or updated on your GitLab project. So you configured GitLab to send merge request events as webhooks. And you deployed some Tekton components:
EventListener: receives webhooks from GitLab
Trigger: starts your Pipeline every time the EventListener receives a new webhook from GitLab
Pipeline: fetches the source code from GitLab and builds it
Then you notice that any event in your merge request (a new comment, a tag change) triggers the pipeline. That&#x27;s not the behavior you desire. You don&#x27;t need to build a comment or a tag, after all. You only want the pipeline to run when th…</span>

Whether on paper or canvas, the mixed-media pieces depict children and teens, and the artist’s quick, sometimes chaotic markings echo the unfiltered immediacy of the sitters’ cheerful and contemplative emotions—prior to each portrait, he spends time learning about his subjects’ lives, their joys, and worries, a practice he finds essential for capturing such candid, honest expressions.

When I write documentation for a project, I often write the Readme file and Install instructions in plain text. I don&#x27;t need to use markup languages like HTML or Markdown to describe what a project does or how to compile it. But maintaining this documentation can be a pain. If I need to update the middle of a sentence in my Readme text file, I need to reformat the text so I don&#x27;t end up with a really long or short line in the middle of my other text that&#x27;s otherwise formatted to 75 columns. Some editors include a feature that will automatically reformat text to fill paragraphs, but not all do. That&#x27;s where the Linux fmt command comes to the rescue.

Teams require some kind of process to coordinate work and ensure that the output of many focuses on a singular goal. Within the software industry, this has taken the form of teams following a methodology such as Agile. In industries from pharmaceutical to manufacturing, Lean is the philosophy followed to ensure that a process is adhered to. The difficulty with a process is that it&#x27;s prescriptive. It&#x27;s designed in such a way that you stay on the tracks that it provides. If you do, you achieve the prescribed benefits and ultimately a form of success. That doesn&#x27;t give much room for paradigm-level shifts in work behavior.

PathMetric 的应用。
PathMetric 简介
PathMetric 是一个用于测量 Path 和抽取子路径（sub-paths） 的工具，通过 Path 类的 computeMetrics方法可以返回一组PathMetric 类。为什么是一组，而不是一个呢？这是因为 Path 可能包含多个不连续的子路径，比如通过 moveTo 可以重新开启新的一段路径。
通过 PathMetric 可以获取到 Path 的长度，路径是否闭合，以及某一段路径是否是 Path的子路径。PathMetrics 是一个迭代器，因此在不获取其中的 PathMet…</span>

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · Android-NoteBook 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 跟我一起成长。
前言
从字面意思上理解，PendingIntent 是一种延迟的 Intent，表示一种延迟执行的意图操作。对，但又不完全对。 一句话概括，PendingIntent 一种是支持授权其他应用以当前应用的身份执行包装的 Intent 操作的系统特性。
在这篇文章里，我将带你理解 PendingIntent 的使用方法、设计理念以及核心源码分析，相信阅读完这篇文章后你对 PendingIntent 的理解将超过绝大部分同学。如果能把帮上忙，请务必点赞加关注，你的支持对我非常重要。
1. 认识 PendingIntent
1.1 为什么要使用 PendingIntent？
PendingIntent 的应用场景关键在于间接的 Intent 跳转需求， 即先通过一级 Intent 跳转到某个组件，在该组件完成任务后再间接地跳转到二级的 Intent。PendingIntent 中的单词 “pending” 指延迟或挂起，就是指它是延迟的或挂起的。例如，你在以下场景中就可以使用 PendingIntent：
场景 1 - 系统通知消息的点击操作
场景 2 - 桌面微件的点击操作
场景 3 - 系统闹钟操作
场景 4 - 第三方应用回调操作
可以看到，在这些场景中，我们真正感兴趣的操作是挂起的，并且该操作并不是由当前应用执行，而是由某个外部应用来 “间接” 执行的。例如，我们在发送系统通知消息时，会通过 PendingIntent 构造一个系统通知 Notification ，并调用 NotificationManager…</span>

                              <span>作为一个每年阅读上万篇各类网络上文章的程序员，也幻想着自己可以把我的人生、经验、幻想和生活写成文章供别人阅读，但是总是面临着「写什么、怎么写、写的不好怎么办」之类的问题，让我将写作这件事一放再放。
在 2022 年的元旦，我走进一家书店，看到了一本叫《642 件可写的小事》的小册子，里面没有文章，只有一个个有趣的题目，随手翻开，有好多题目都让我想立刻找只笔写两句，我想这样的书是真的能治好我写作拖延症的。
回到家后我就在手机里找类似的 app，结果市面上的写作类 app 都是直接给你一张白纸让你开始写，对于像我一样的人来说，在面对一张白纸时会产生畏惧和焦虑，根本无从下手，所以为了让我自己迈出写作的第一步，我开发了《写点啥》，并且在上线的第一周，很荣幸的获得了 App Store 编辑推荐。
用一个小功能帮助你开始写作
使用《写点啥》会有一种做命题作文或单机版知乎的感觉，它的核心功能就是在底部随机弹出一条题目，根据题目，写一些亲身经历或者虚构的故事。如果对这条题目不感兴趣，也可以随时换一个（但是我建议大家都尝试写一下）。
iPhone 版iPad 版
《写点啥》里的题目类型丰富，例如：「在安静的地方坐 15 分钟，打开所有的感官，写下注意到的事情。」或者「找到一张童年的照片，描写当时的情景。」之类的题目可以帮助写作新手在不知道该写点什么的时候从发现身边的小事开始；再例如「假设地球是方形的……」和「你发现了宇宙的边缘，它是什么样子的？」这样的题目，有助于帮你打开脑洞，在一个个这样生动有趣儿的题目写作后，你会慢慢积累写作素材和灵感，我相信，当积累到一定程度时，一定会帮助你厚积薄发！
引导坚持写作
为了引导大家去坚持每天写几篇，我们在应用内放入了写作热力图，通过每天「填格子」的方式，让写作保持连贯性，并且增加一些成就感。同时我还尝试做了三款精美桌面小组件，来更有趣的提醒大家写作。
「填格子」
「填格子」来源于 GitHub，是一种能促使人们连续完成某件事情的方式。

小组件的图片在浅色和深色模式下有不同的感觉，浅色模式下 Emoji 表情随着当天写作篇数的变化而变化，深色模式下灯泡的亮度也会跟着越来越亮，还有谁不想桌面有只小猫咪呢？
为 iPad 量身定做
在《写点啥》 iOS 版上线后，我收到了很多的反馈，其中呼声最高的就是 iPad 版本，因为写作这件事，在 iPad 上会更加舒服一些，所以我决定开发一套更适合 iPad 大屏幕和交互的《写点啥》，期间调研开发用了两个多月的时间，正好赶上 WWDC22 中推出的 iPadOS 16 的前台调度功能，就一并给支持了，目前我会通过 iPhone 随时随地的看一下感兴趣的题目，写一下大纲，再用 iPad 来完善细节，写一些更长的文章。
2022-07-17 上线了 iPad 版
关于 Android 和 Web 版
目前《写点啥》的用户数据都是保存在 Apple 的 iCloud 或者本地，如果要开发 Android 或者 Web 版，数据需要放到自己的服务器上，开发和维护成本都会变高，由于我本职是个 iOS 程序员，现在是业余时间兴趣驱动开发，所以暂时只支持 Apple 的平台，上线 iPad 版后，希望可以帮助有 iPad 的 Android 和 Windows 用户使用《写点啥》，希望有一天能成为一名全职独立开发者，可以将《写点啥》带到更多的平台，帮助更多人们。
后续功能
首先我会保证《写点啥》的单机版属性，可以在这里放心大胆的写。但如果想分享的话，《写点啥》也会不断提供好看的分享模板。如果大家有想写的话题，也可以自定义话题，也许还可以将话题像漂流瓶一样随机给其他人，围绕这核心的话题功能，随时发现想写的内容。当你慢慢的对写作信手拈来，想要有明确的写作主题或者记录下一些脑海中一闪而过的灵感时，也会提供自由写作的功能。《写点啥》会伴随着你的成长，为你带来更多帮助提升写作体验的功能。

最后
长度世界第二，流量世界第一的亚马逊河上，竟然连一座桥梁都没有！所以只要我能搭起一座桥梁，我就能比亚马逊河还要厉害。如果我将目前的《写点啥》app 视为一条小溪的源头，那么我希望有一天，她能成为一条奔腾入海的大河，每一个版本的发布，就是在这条河上建起一座桥梁，桥的这一头是我们，桥的那一头是用户，希望每一座桥梁都能为用户带来一幅不一样的风景。
如果你有任何建议和问题，都可以随时与我联系，我很愿意聆听和解答。</span>

                              <span>前言
某音国际版(以下简写为TT)中使用了自定义的SSL框架，提高抓包的成本。如xp框架JustTrustMe、frida框架r0capture等均会失效。原因在于这些模块针对的是系统原生的SSL框架，而TT自定义了自己的SSL框架。那么如果我们需要对TT进行抓包的话，就需要对TT的检测动手脚，本文章会举例两种方式进行TT(Android)的网络请求获取。(网上都有相关教程，文章仅为自己实践记录)
TT版本为全球版(packageName:com.zhiliaoapp.musically version:25.0.3)。
方式一：通过修改so包跳过SSL检测
常见的抓包方式大多数是使用Fiddler、Charles等工具，本文使用Fiddler进行抓包操作，电脑系统Window 10。
Fiddler的安装及Https抓包配置就不赘述了，自行网上查找相关文章。这里需要注意一点，Android 7+的版本，系统将不信任用户证书，正常通过Fiddler下载安装的证书依旧无法抓包HTTPS。这时需要一台root后的手机，将Fiddler的证书转换为系统证书并安装到手机内。
Fiddler系统证书具体操作
1、点击Fiddler的Tools选择Options，弹窗的选项卡中选择HTTPS，点击右侧Actions选择Export Root Certificate to Desktop将Fiddler证书导出桌面，
2、打开cmd，通过openssl命令获取到Fiddler证书的hash值。
openssl x509 -inform DER -subject_hash_old -in FiddlerRoot.cer


3、将导出的证书重命名，格式为：获取到的hash值.0，如我获取到的hash值为e5c3944b，那么我的证书名字命名为e5c3944b.0。
4、将重命名后的文件放置…</span>

「时光不负，创作不停，本文正在参加2022年中总结征文大赛」
前言
不知不觉半年又过去了，想了想去年立下的 flag 都是有一定难度的（比如 GitHub 2k stars），目前都没完成。原本不知道年中总结写啥好，但是回想了下今年上半年收获到了不少认可，有很多开心的瞬间，可以借此机会分享一下。并且也是作为自己的一个记录，希望以后回看这篇文章能想起当时的喜悦~
上半年最开心的几件事
GitHub 被微软大佬关注了
4 月 8 号的早上打开 GitHub，突然一下子有很多人在 GitHub 关注了我，有点吓到我了，因为平时我的 GitHub 很偶尔才有一两个人关注。正当我疑惑之时，翻到一个熟悉的名字，这不是 Drakeet 吗？！

Drakeet 是一位前微软大佬（离开微软仅仅是因为实现了财富自由不需要太努力了），我当时以为我看错了，在看到那 7.6k followers 后确认了是他本人。那么突然被很多人关注就不奇怪了，Drakeet 的关注者会看到 Drakeet stared following DylanCaiCoding，下面有我的简介“一个兴趣使然的程序工匠”，别人可能会感兴趣点进去看看是何方神圣。
个人的 GitHub 资料有做些门面功夫，可能不少人看了觉得不错就也点了关注。

能被 Drakeet 关注让我非常意外，因为想让别人在 GitHub 关注你是一件非常难的事情，这远比单个库获得 stars 难多了。我很久以前就了解到 Drakeet 了，还作为纯纯写作的用户加过他微信，我知道他的要求是很高的，能出现在他 GitHub 的关注列表我想都不敢想。
那时候 Drakeet 在凯哥星球做嘉宾，我就在星球发了条动态，Drakeet 本人在底下进行了回复。

我当时看到 Drakeet 的回复超级开心，其中提到的“工工整整”…</span>

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
前言
终于算是忙完了一个阶段！！！从4月份开始，工作内容以及职务上都进行了较大的变动，最直接的就是从海外项目组调到了国内项目组。国内项目组目前有两个应用在同时跑着，而且还有几个马甲包也要维护，不知道大家发版的时候复杂不复杂，反正我们每次发版的时候都需要经历--打包、加固、对齐、重签名、打渠道包、上传云存储、生成渠道推广链接、生成内更SQL、上传Mapping文件等等步骤(xN)，简直是折磨人啊。
所以首要任务就是做出一套自动化的基础设施来，最初直接考虑到的方案是【Jenkins+Docker+360命令行加固+VasDolly+Bugly等】的方案（下一篇文章会给大家分享该方案），整个过程下来基本能达到自动化的目的。就这么稳定的跑了一个多月，然而，在5月下旬的时候360加固发布了一个通知，大致内容就是免费版用户无法使用命令行的加固方式了，只能手动用工具加固。这就导致最初的方案直接垮掉，我花费了个把月学习Linux，Pipeline，Docker，还制作了各种镜像，结果突然不能用了，心塞。然而路还是要继续走下去的，在尽量不花钱的前提下，想到了开发桌面端工具的方案。
功能一览
接下来先给大家一览下桌面端工具的基本功能，我的电脑是Windows的，所以都是基于Windows平台下的build-tools相关工具进行开发的。首先大部分的功能都是基于jar或exe文件，那么在Java（Kotlin）中我们可以通过如下方式来调用这些外部程序，exec其实最终也是调用了ProcessBuilder，整体的原理就是如此：
//方式1
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd)
    
//方式2

                              <span>前言：在去年的这个时候，谷歌官方推荐使用 Flow 替代LiveData，一年时间过去了，我相信还是有很多android开发的朋友和我一样有以下几个问题：Android开发人员需要从 LiveData 迁移到 Kotlin Flows 吗？LiveData 现在是否已弃用？

通过阅读本文你能了解到或学到什么：
① Flow, Shared flow &amp; State flow的使用(具体操作本文就不多说了，给大家推荐好文)
② SharedFlow 和 StateFlow，它们也有自己的可变类型——MutableSharedFlow 和 MutableStateFlow，对比LiveData我到底用哪一个？
③我们已经有了Flow，为啥还会有SharedFlow、StateFlow，Flow不够用吗？
④我要迁移到Flow吗？
有人问：LiveData是不是真的快要被废弃了。LiveData：你是故意找茬？
我要迁移到Flow吗？
我们先来回答这个大家最关心的问题
🚀结论：如果 LiveData 满足您的需求，那么就不急于替换它，如果是一个新项目，推荐在 UI 中用 LiveData，在Repo层 中用 Flow。
下面请欣赏RxJava与LiveData&amp;Flow的爱恨情仇：
在2017年之前，大家都是使用RxJava去配合Retrofit实现网络请求，RxJava实现事件订阅。但是，谁用谁知道 (真的复杂，各种线程的切换，头脑爆炸，不过，现在用协程就可以啦😻) 。因为是真…</span>

上一篇 《Flutter 绘制探索 | 来一起画箭头吧》 ，实现了一个可以自由拓展的箭头绘制小体系。线和箭头的旋转已经封装好了，只需要在矩形端点矩形域中提供路径即可。本文我们就来对端点的箭头路径进行拓展，丰富箭头的样式，同时也更方便使用者调用。

draw.io 是我最喜欢的绘制软件，没有之一，本文就其中的一些常用箭头端点样式进行实现。通过仿写，可以对其中的箭头进行一些额外的参数配置，来满足更多的配置需求。这就是代码由自己掌控的好处，想实现什么可以自己动手，丰衣足食。

1. 箭头绘制环境
打个比方，我要造火箭的螺丝，并没有必要在火箭生产的现场去制作。在车间中根据图纸，按照尺寸制作就行了，造完后拿过去拧上就行了。这就是对复杂场景进行分离，将相对独立的生产对象独立出来，这样能够简化场景，更专注于做一件事。就像本文，我只想专注做一件事，就是如何在一块矩形区域内，来创建各种各样的箭头路径。
设计感 ，这里画个如下的辅助路径，对矩形区域进行示意。正所谓，磨刀不误砍柴工，通过这个 4*4 的圈格，可以让设计更直观。这就像是一个坐标，一个参考线，能给我们一些 安全感 。

这个背景绘制的代码如下所示，其实就是一些最基本的路径操作而已。对看过 《Flutter 绘制指南 - 妙笔生花》的朋友来说，这些都是小菜一碟：
void main() {
  runApp(const ColoredBox(color: Colors.white, child: Painter()));
}

class Painter extends StatelessWidget {
  const Painter({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

Flutter 里的  BuildContext  相信大家都不会陌生，虽然它叫 Context，但是它实际是  Element 的抽象对象，而在 Flutter 里，它主要来自于 ComponentElement 。
关于  ComponentElement  可以简单介绍一下，在 Flutter 里根据 Element  可以简单地被归纳为两类：
RenderObjectElement ：具备 RenderObject ，拥有布局和绘制能力的 Element
ComponentElement ：没有 RenderObject ，我们常用的 StatelessWidget  和 StatefulWidget  里对应的 StatelessElement 和 StatefulElement 就是它的子类。
所以一般情况下，我们在 build 方法或者  State 里获取到的   BuildContext   其实就是  ComponentElement 。
那使用  BuildContext   有什么需要注意的问题？
首先如下代码所示，在该例子里当用户点击 FloatingActionButton 的时候，代码里做了一个 2秒的延迟，然后才调用  pop 退出当前页面。
class _ControllerDemoPageState extends State {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () async {

为什么键盘上的字母按照QWERTY的顺序排列？为什么计算机编程总喜欢“Hello, World”？为什么电视剧时长通常为每集45分钟？为什么高铁座位分布是ABCDF却没有E呢……以上种种问题，都可以用“路径依赖”理论（Path-Dependence）加以解释。
普遍意义上，路径依赖是指一旦选择某一路径（无论是“好”还是“坏”）就可能对这种路径产生依赖，进而沿着既定方向持续前进。这一理论由美国经济学家Paul David在1985年提出，后因美国经济学家Doglass North借该理论阐释经济制度演进规律而扬名。[1]
通俗地讲，“路径依赖”可以被理解为传统惯习的力量，过去的经验被应用于新的情境之下，产生或好或坏的影响。
在互联网发展过程中，也存在着诸多“路径依赖”或“传统惯习”现象，甚至不被我们所察觉。当我们把视野进一步纵向拓展，这些习惯可能来自互联网初期、来自电视或印刷时代，或是更为久远的传播史早期。
本文从路径依赖的理论出发，希望去发现和理解网络生活中的此类现象，并进入媒介演进的视野，探索过去如何影响现在，甚至持续地影响着将来。
信息生活里的路径依赖现象
1868年，一位名叫Christopher Latham Sholes的美国出版商为打字机模型申请专利，并于1874年成功将商用打字机投放市场。
在这六年间，打字机键盘上的字母顺序几经变换，从“ABCDE”到“QWE.TY”，再到“QWERTUIOPY”，随后又调整了“Y”的顺序，最终固定为“QWERTY”。[2]
这一字母顺序借助打字机的行销逐渐成为打字员的习惯，进而延续至今，出现在我们使用的电脑键盘上，这可以看作是一种“路径依赖”。
同时，也有批评者认为QWERTY的布局并不符合使用习惯，因此，旨在提升打字效率的Dvorak键盘于1936年问世，但还是没有影响到前者的主导地位。

一、场景
在日常使用app的过程中，基本上会遇见把窗口缩小的场景出现，比如B站看视频，微信直播，微信视频通话等，主动缩小或者返回都会触发悬浮窗体的显示，如下：
b站
微信视频号









那么实现这种效果一般的思路是怎样，可以继续往下看。
二、思考点
针对窗口缩小或者悬浮窗需要考虑几个重要的点：
悬浮窗体的比例以及层级，层级要在statusbar之下且在activity之上，这样才能保证其不会被其他业务界面覆盖；
悬浮框显示后，内部的视频内容如何无缝衔接继续显示；
三、思路
实现整个悬浮窗的核心在于WindowManager与window的交互。
WindowManager是app与window通信的一个接口。从语义上看WindowManager是用来管理window的一个接口，那么window又是什么？其实我们常见的Dialog、Popup、StatusBar等本质就是window，window是一个抽象类，相当于一个联盟，Dialog、Popup等view只有依附在window这个联盟才能发挥功能，而WindowManager就像是联盟的会长，负责与子view等会员通信，并且能够对他们进行增加、更新和删除。
实现悬浮窗就需要配置不同的参数于属性，关于WindowManager参数、属性的详细资料可以参看https://juejin.cn/post/6844903882158505992
从上面描述可以知道利用addView将View添加在window上，同样的，WindowManager.LayoutParams.type可以设置View的层级，防止被其他业务界面所覆盖。
四、实现
4.1、请求悬浮窗权限

https://github.com/hackware1993/Flutter_ConstraintLayout
前言
这是一份 Flutter ConstraintLayout 的完全指南，基于当前最新的 1.6.3-stable 版本。由于现在的 API 已经稳定，所以本文可能会长期适用，后期仅会有很小的变动。
如果你有 Android ConstraintLayout 的经验，那你能上手更快，但也希望你能认真看完全文，因为声明式 UI 下的用法和 XML 里的用法截然不同。并且它有很多 Android ConstraintLayout 所不具有的优秀特性。如果你是一名 iOSer，那就更应该看完了，据我的了解，不论是 Android 下的 ConstraintLayout，还是 Flutter ConstraintLayout，它们都和 AutoLayout 有很大的不同。
约束布局的本质
任何布局控件的核心都在于计算子控件的大小和位置。而约束布局的核心在于使用约束来计算子控件的大小和位置，而约束的本质是对齐。即指定子控件的上、下、左、右、基线分别和哪些子控件（或 parent）的哪些位置去对齐。这直接决定了子控件的位置，并可能决定子控件的大小（如果子控件大小指定为 matchConstraint 的话）。
用过约束布局的人几乎都回不去了，主要是因为它有两大杀手锏，一是它能让布局层次更加扁平化，这样能带来渲染性能的提升。二是强大灵活的布局（排版）能力能…</span>

1. 认识散列表
1.1 散列表的作用
散列算法是散列表的核心，也就做哈希算法或 Hash 算法，是一个意思。散列算法是一种将任意长度输入转换为固定长度输出的算法，输出的结果就是散列值。基于散列算法实现的散列表，可以实现快速查找元素的特性。
总结一下散列算法的主要性质：
性质
描述




1、单向性（基本性质）
支持从输入生成散列值，不支持从散列值反推输入

                              <span>我非常贪恋睡眠，因为我每天都会做梦，并且第二天起来，我几乎都记得自己做了什么梦。无论是好梦、荒诞的梦、还是噩梦，我都会贪恋其中不愿意起床，它们仿佛短暂的解开了我的脚铐手链，让我飞了一会，飞到了一个和我的真实生活完全不一样的世界。
如果我放任自己开始苏醒，真实生活里的点点滴滴，就会像早晨洗脸被拧开的水龙头的水一样，涌入大脑还泄流不止。一睁开眼睛就开始思考真实生活，真是一件悲伤的事。所以当我不得不起床之后，我总会尽我所能留住那种和现实脱节的感觉，能留多久是多久。能暂时不展开真实生活的点点面相，就暂时不展开。
这种不展开的方式，于我而言就是阅读、纯粹的写作、或者看电影。阅读，是掉入另一个人的大脑去看 TA 写出来的世界；写作，是掉入自己的思想，内观自己的思绪世界；有时我也会一起床先看一部电影。电影，啊，电影，那就是另一个人的故事了，与我完全没有关系的陌生人的生活。这些都是逃离，让我暂时不必被真实生活的清单事项所淹没。
也因此，我的生活在某个节点，被分割成了「之前」和「之后」，这个节点的划分，于我而言就是开微信：查收微信消息的那一刻，就代表着我被拉回现实，开始需要处理跟真实生活息息相关的消息、通知、事项。我上午从不开微信，一般看微信都是下午1点后了。当然，这种回归现实的方式，也是循序渐进式的：1点前后，我会第一次开微信，只是纯粹接收消息，确认无要紧之事后，又立刻关闭微信。直到下午3点我的微信才正式处于常开状态，表示我正式接受来自真实生活里清单事项的随时打扰，繁碎日常正式拉开序幕。
我现在颇享受这种隔离时段式的生活节奏，3点之前专注创作，3点之后回归生活，「回归」这个词已经说明，我刻意与真实生活保持距离的个人态度。我的一天于是就这样拥有了两幅面孔：上午，是流离于真实生活的异想世界，下午，是落地于真实生活的现实世界。那晚上呢？
晚上，是所有互联网产品必争的时段，也是人最情绪化，情感状态最饱满的时候。这个时刻，我又有了一种脱离真实生活的漂浮感，但它和上午的「脱离」还不太一样。上午的脱离感是我刻意营造的，晚上的脱离感则是浑然天成的。它是异想世界和真实生活经过漫长一天的交织、杂融、沉淀之后形成的，自带一种未经雕琢的生野感，能随时将你吞噬，将你包围，张力如此之强，让你无处遁型。所以，人才会多半选择在晚上谈情做爱，那种呼之欲出、溢都溢不住的原始本能，不仅是商家必争，也是艺术家必争。这个最容易飘的时段，我觉得也是最能体现我与自己是否真的自洽的时刻。你能多大程度上接受自己的各种情绪？允许它？放任它？还是压制它？抵制它？与晚上的相处，具有了一种哲学感：是什么？为什么？你想干什么？
可惜，到现在我依然还在摸索与深夜的相处之道：「情绪那么饱满，你总不能浪费吧？」脑子里这个声音颇为强烈，总觉得我应该物尽其用。可每一天的晚上都不太一样，今晚如蜜糖般的度过方式，放在明天也许就是砒霜。何为物尽其用？更何况，多数时候，夜晚让我觉得自己过得失败而忙碌，怎么又是一个颗粒无收，或效果甚微的一天？所以我现在会想，或者，选择给夜晚注入理性哲思，本身就是一个错误，所以我才会屡战屡败，跟它过得如此拧巴。
那不如，就让上午承担想象，下午承担事项，晚上它什么也别承担了。就如情绪，它最需要的也许就只是被看见。也别绞尽脑汁赋予它什么意义，哪有那么多事需要意义？
所以，我总结出了什么吗？我享受我割裂的三段式生活节奏，我给「幻想」和「现实」各自独立的空间，并保证雨露均沾。至于晚上，我不为难它，它也不必为难我。三十后的「自处之道」，大抵如此。</span>

                              <span>这两天在Reddit上看到一个关于「AirPlay 2 on Linux」的帖子，其中推荐了 Shairport Sync 项目，于是我打算给家里在用的树莓派的AirPlay升级一下。大家有能力的可以直接去看原文，里面文档写的很详细。
准备

一台Linux 或 FreeBSD的设备，其性能至少要大于等于树莓派 2
319 和 320端口没有被占用
一个音箱（最好是3.5mm接口）

开始安装
首选建议大家先将系统更新到最新状态，可以大大减少许多莫名其妙的问题。
sudo apt-get update #检查更新
sudo apt-get upgrade #执行更新
关闭Wi-Fi节能管理
如果你使用设备使用Wi-Fi连接的话，需要将节能管理关闭，可以避免安装后设备进入节能后搜索不到音箱。
iwconfig wlan0 power off
安装依赖
以下是Shairport Sync需要依赖
apt install --no-install-recommends build-essential git xxd xmltoman \ 
autoconf automake libtool libpopt-dev libconfig-dev libasound2-dev \ 
avahi-daemon libavahi-client-dev libssl-dev libsoxr-dev libplist-dev \ 
libsodium-dev libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev uuid-dev libgcrypt-dev
nqptp
nqptp是 Shairport Sync 监控时间的重要依赖，需要手动编译安装。

                              <span>近日，少数派首页出现了一篇名为《把握浏览器的「门面」：少数派作者们都在用什么启动页？》的文章。在文章中，几位作者分别介绍了自己喜欢的浏览器启动页插件，评论区也有很多读者分享了自己的解决方案。
可以看出，关于浏览器 newtab 的花样确实很多。网址导航、todolist、番茄钟……各种玩法都很有趣。可我和大家的喜好偏偏相反，我特别钟情于纯空白页，讨厌 newtab 中出现任何元素。🌚
Chrome 浏览器的 newtab 在默认情况下，由早期的空白页不知道什么时候开始变成了 Google 搜索框：
默认 chrome://newtab
如果你想去掉这个搜索框，解决办法是在 Chrome 设置中把地址栏搜索引擎从 Google 改成其他。这时候你会发现， Google 搜索框确实是不见了，可 newtab 的内容又变成了 8 个历史记录中的网站，还关不掉。删掉以后又会出来新的 8 个网站。容易泄露隐私的同时，它给出的建议也不一定用得上……
修改搜索引擎后的 chrome://newtab
而 Edge 这边的情况更加离谱：
Edge 不知是从哪里得来的设计灵感，newtab 变成了新闻股票大杂烩，用户挣 kuī 钱吃瓜两不误。可能是担心瓜的热度太高，造成吃瓜群众中暑，还贴心为你展示了天气信息。
默认 edge://newtab
好在 Edge 可以关闭这个 newtab 中大部分的内容，但最后还剩 bing 搜索框无法去除。左下角还有增值电信业务经营许可证号，真的是想逼死强迫症。🥲
关闭内容展示后的 edge://newtab
1.安装 Super Evil New Tab Redux
为此我找到了「Super Evil New Tab Redux」这款 Chrome 插件，我的需求才得以解决。这款插件可以为 newtab 设置背景色，可以添加自定义 HTML、CSS、JS 代码。
Super Evil New Tab Redux 选项
插件地址：Chrome 网上应用店
插件接管 newtab 之后，默认背景是黑色的，建议修改 Background Color 为白色，或者设置 RGB 值为：255 255 255，这样你就会收获一个纯净的 newtab：

2.修改源文件
虽然 newtab 变纯净了，但还是有一点点不完美：由于 newtab 被第三方插件接管，因此新建标签页时，标签页左侧 favicon 从  Chrome 图标变成了插件图标，看上去有一些违和。这时我发现插件本身已经开源，可以简单修改一下文件就能达到最理想的效果。

2.1 修改newtab.html文件
下载源码并解压，打开 newtab.html文件。
将第 6 行代码中的New Tab修改为：新标签页。
2.2 修改插件 icons
去网络中寻找 Chrome 图标，比如在 iconfont 网站中就可以搜到很多这样的图标。
iconfont
选择一个你喜欢的图标，分别下载尺寸为 512、128、96、48、32、16 的 png 文件。打开插件源码中的「icons」文件夹，按照其中的文件命名规律，对刚刚下载的图标文件重新命名，替换原文件。
替换后的 icons
chrome://newtab 默认 favicon 是灰色的，我使用的是彩色 Chrome 图标，你也可以选择原风格的图标。
2.3 修改 options.html 文件
顺手对options.html进行简单的汉化，使用起来更加直观。

3.载入修改版插件
在 Chrome 中打开 chrome://extensions 页面，开启右上方的「开发者模式」。点击「加载已解压的扩展程序」，选取你刚才修改的 Super Evil New Tab Redux 源代码文件夹。此时经过修改后的插件就可以使用了。

最终效果
经过修改的 newtab 样式已经彻底融入了 Chrome，完全看不出一点违和感。
修改后的 newtab 样式修改后的插件选项
插件同样适用于所有 Chromium 内核浏览器，载入方法也是一样的。
Edge 浏览器使用效果
Edge 浏览器载入该插件后，彩色图标莫名其妙变成了黑白色，但是不影响使用。建议 Edge 用户在上文步骤 2.2 中搜索 Edge 图标进行替换。
Edge：我生气了，哄不好的那种。🙃
你还可以把修改后的插件进行备份，或者放进系统引导盘，让它成为你的装机必备。❤️</span>

然而由于各种原因，我无法将所有我想分享的内容撰成整篇的文章，所以我想通过「档案室」这个系列，不定期记录、分享一些我认为值得分享的、最近在读/听/思考的一些事情，也希望能由此产生一些有趣的讨论。
在看的一本书
《可能性的艺术》 by 刘瑜
刘瑜的几本大众向的书我都看过了，包括《民主的细节》、《观念的水位》、《送你一颗子弹》，这些都是好多年前看的了，具体的内容肯定是不记得的，但是当时看的心情似乎还能想起一些——她的文字简单但清醒、深刻但不做作、知识量又巨大（至少对于非政治学出生的我而言），恰到好处的升华也总是让人读完有畅快之感。
这种感觉我之前似乎忘了，但是在读《可能性的艺术》时，那种感觉又回来了。而且阅读她的书，不仅仅能有知识上的收获——如果你对政治学感兴趣的话——还能有思维方式和写作技巧上的收获。
对于《可能性的艺术》这本书，我认为至少有三个角度来阅读这本书。
第一，是了解「比较政治学」的基本理念及背后的背景知识。通过比较理解政治，比较不同国家在国家能力、国家转型、文化政治发展等不同方面的兴盛衰退及其背后的原因，来理解世界为什么是这个样子。
其中有一个知识上的收获，是让我觉得最值得，也是让我受到震撼的——对于和平的认识。 
在《可能性的艺术》里，有一章叫「和平的爆发」。「爆发」这个词在这里似乎有些不合时宜，但纵观人类历史，和平时代其实是非常短暂的，充满了大规模战争的年代才是「常态」，而我们只是非常幸运地出生在和平的几十年、和平的国家，我们思考的问题是明年要去哪里玩，而不是明天…</span>

Some advice can be a vice. Feel free to take what you can use, and leave the rest.

之前听博主万卉说，人约等于计算机的思维框架对她很管用，她会把时间分成输入、处理、交互、输出这四块，健康的体魄与高效的大脑是好的硬件基础，知行合一意味着好的交互的匹配度，独立思考需要我们拥有好的信息处理能力。
这个思维方式也对我非常有启发，我据此优化了自己日常生活的记录方式。而我目前生活的重心是在输入这一块，我很珍惜自己阅读、听播客的时光，它们在我看来就和玩耍一样有趣，我能持续收获有趣与新奇的感觉，这也让我想到硅谷投资人纳瓦尔Naval所说的：

要想有所专长，就要追求真正的兴趣和热爱，累积专长的过程，对你而言就像玩耍，对他人来说则很吃力。

关于输入，一方面我会筛选自己的信息源，去有意识地主动输入，关于这点想和大家分享张潇雨老师在播客中提到的一个「企鹅理论」，非常形象生动，大致是说：人的大脑是一片冰川，每个记忆点都是一只企鹅。冰川面积有限，每有一只垃圾企鹅进入冰川上，冰川上原有的企鹅就会掉进海洋，所以不要让无用无趣的企鹅，挤掉生动有趣的企鹅。
而另一方面，我也会引入一些随机性，避免自己陷入信息茧房，一位神经和行为科学家Leyla写的文章《Allow error into your life and experience the joy …</span>
