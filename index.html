                              <span>Hey fellas I am Yash Makan back with another article. Today we are going to continue our journey where you and I are going to create a complete whatsapp applicaion from scratch. Yup, from very start till the end. This is the part 5 of the series so If you have missed the previous parts then I will highly suggest you to check the playlist to understand better. If you don’t know about whatsapp application then basically it’s a social media messaging application where user can send messages to their friends &amp; family. It also has features like video calling, status sharing and much more. And if you are thinking, are we going to develop all these features?? then the answer is yes my friend... Also If you are tired of reading and want me to get out of your mind then I’ve got a video covering all this just watch the youtube video below.

                              <span>JSON has become one of the most popular data interchange formats on the web, thus it&#x27;s vital that server-side languages handle it well.
In this article I will explain how to work with JSON. I will use the previous API I wrote, check my previous article before continue.
First of all, your dependencies should looks like this:
[dependencies]
rocket &#x3D; &quot;0.4.11&quot;
rocket_codegen &#x3D; &quot;0.4.11&quot;
http &#x3D; &quot;0.2&quot;
reqwest &#x3D; { version &#x3D; &quot;0.11&quot;, features &#x3D; [&quot;blocking&quot;,&quot;json&quot;] }

serde &#x3D; { version &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;, features &#x3D; [&quot;derive&quot;] }
serde_json &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;


To begin, you must add the Serialize and Deserialize traits on your type. To use derive macros check if the derive: feature is enabled in your dependencies.
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]

Checking a specific value&#x27;s type at runtime is the primary function of type guards. This helps the TypeScript compiler, which then uses the information to become more predictive about the types.
I was creating this very platform melbite.com CRUD operations, as usual we have to pass Props when using react. My props consisted of Numbers, Strings and even Boolean and I was running out of time.
Take an example below, you have update user profile component,


And you want to pass props like username &amp; age, you first have to define your interface props like this,
interface UserData {
username: string,
age: number
}

Then your  component should me looking like this,
const UpdateProfile: FC &#x3D; (props): JSX.Element &#x3D;&gt; {
  

  
};

Then pass your props like this,
const UpdateProfile: FC &#x3D; (props): JSX.Element &#x3D;&gt; {
  
    {props.username}
    {props.age}
  
};

Passing props with Javascript might cause unnecessary bugs in your application.

                              <span>Working on my latest post regarding module federation here and the work I am doing regarding Module Federation at work brought me to a situation where I was wondering if there is another way to load a remote module, not at build time but runtime; After researching and attending to talks about the subject, I found that this is supported out of the box with Webpack and module federation plug-in.
Dynamically remote modules using Webpack Module Federation at runtime, so for me, &quot;This Is The Way&quot;.

Configuring the Host App
Load script from remote module dynamically
Load Component from webpack share scope
Consume remote component from host
Small peek of remote configuration
Result

Use ModuleFederationPlugin in your webpack.config.js of the app that you wish to consume modules.

The Okay Bears’ NFT collection spiked the Solana NFT network in a 24-hour record-breaking sales. Many collectors showcased prototypes of their Okay Bears NFT on Twitter. Some auctioned theirs at a price far higher than the floor price. And they’re still selling out.
The project has come a long way from popularity to breaking into the Solana NFT market with an overwhelming secondary trading volume of up to 91 percent, according to Magic Eden’s 29th of April tweet. We can’t ignore the floor price that jumped at a point as high as 165 SOL during mint. Indeed, it’d appear that anyone who owns an Okay Bears right now hasn’t only hit the jackpot but wields it.

So far, we’ve got our eyes on the Okay Bears collection, and here’s our sneak peek.

Then activate it using
env/Scripts/activate on windows
source env/bin/activate on linux/unix

Now that we have our environment set up let&#x27;s install what we need.
pip install fastapi uvicorn gunicorn psycopg2-binary

You may add the deps depending on what your project will need in order to work.
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt

Next create a file called main.py at the root of the project and add the following code to it.

Today we&#x27;ll dive a bit deeper into one of the elements: WAI-ARIA roles.
The specific roles can add semantic meaning to elements where HTML might miss this context.
Certain elements have these roles by default. For example,  elements already have a navigation role.

But non-semantic elements like div and span have no roles. In some cases, we might want to set these explicitly.
We can split these roles into six different categories.
Document structure roles
These roles are used to add a structural description for a section of content. Most of these should have semantic alternatives nowadays.

                              <span>Automation frameworks enable automation testers by simplifying the test development and execution activities. A typical automation framework provides an environment for executing test plans and generating repeatable output. They are specialized tools that assist you in your everyday test automation tasks. Whether it is a test runner, an action recording tool, or a web testing tool, it is there to remove all the hard work from building test scripts and leave you with more time to do quality checks. Test Automation is a proven, cost-effective approach to improving software development. Therefore, choosing the best test automation framework can prove crucial to your test results and QA timeframes.

Most of our developers also prefer chrome and chromium browsers as there preferred browsers. And here’s a list of top chrome extensions we use in our development efforts.

When in ones developer journey should one look into the topic of patterns? 
As of my opinion is as early as possible and here is why! 😊 
Development can be simply descripted as solving problems and occasionally drinking coffee ☕, and although this is what we as developers do and also what we hopefully enjoy doing, there is not always a need for that. Why you ask? Well, firstly that in your hand is properly not your first one of the day, and secondly lots of people, especially four very dedicated man, already did a lot of thinking for you 🧠.

Atoms are used to store a value. But selectors are used to getting or setting the value of an atom. In simple words, selectors help you perform complex logic for your website.
Let’s suppose I give you a project of making a currency converter. In this project, you need to have two inputs US dollars and Rupee. But the problem is how will you convert the US dollars to Rupee in recoil so that you can use values globally.
We can use selectors here. But how?
Step1: Setup your recoil.

Step2: Now make a new atom called usdAtom 
Step3: Now make a new selector called rupeeSelector

European Union lawmakers have reached an agreement on legislation that will force all future smartphones sold in the EU — including Apple’s iPhone — be equipped with the universal USB-C port for wired charging by fall 2024. The rule will also apply to other electronic devices including tablets, digital cameras, headphones, handheld video game consoles, and e-readers. 
The legislation has been under consideration for years, but an agreement on its scope and details was reached this morning following negotiations between different EU bodies. 
The European Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection announced the news in a tweet ahead of a press conference due to take place at 12:30 CEST (6:30AM ET) later today. The...

A new version of macOS means a new collection of Macs can no longer run Apple’s latest desktop operating system. Perhaps most notably, the new macOS Ventura update won’t be available for the 2015 MacBook Pro. 
This laptop quickly became a fan-favorite model because it was one of the last to come with a traditional scissor switch keyboard before Apple ditched it in favor of its much derided butterfly keyboard. Thankfully, Apple has since brought back this traditional keyboard design, meaning there are some very good Apple Silicon-powered replacements available for anyone still holding on to the 2015 machine. 
Here’s the complete list of Macs that Ventura is compatible with:
iMac (2017 and later)
iMac Pro (2017)
Mac Pro (2019 and later)

Apple is finally adding the ability to see your stored Wi-Fi password in iOS 16. MacRumors reports that the iOS 16 developer preview includes an option to view a Wi-Fi password and even copy it to share with friends or family. You need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to see a stored password, and then you get an option to copy it.
If you own an iPhone then you know of the struggle to share Wi-Fi passwords when a family member or friend visits and they’re a green bubble aficionado (Android user) or they own a Windows laptop. Even though your phone is connected to the network, you still have to search around for the Wi-Fi password at the back of the router or on that old crusty piece of paper where you shouldn’t be...

Apple is adding native support for the Nintendo Switch Pro and Joy-Con controllers in iOS 16. Riley Testut, one of the iOS developers behind AltStore, discovered the new controller support in a developer beta of iOS 16 that was released yesterday. 
The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller works “perfectly” according to Testut, and both Joy-Con controllers show up as a single device for apps and games to take advantage of. Nat Brown, an engineering manager at Apple, has confirmed the new controller support and even revealed there’s a neat method to switch how the Joy-Cons work in iOS 16. You can dynamically switch between using both Joy-Cons as a single controller or two separate ones by holding the screenshot and home buttons for a few...

As part of today’s announcements at WWDC 2022, Apple briefly mentioned a new addition to its security tools that will apply to iPhone, iPad, and Mac platforms called Rapid Security Response. It didn’t go into a lot of detail about what Rapid Security Response is, but Apple is promising to have important security updates that get to your devices even faster. Currently, iOS and macOS users get their security updates rolled in with full system patches, usually with .1 or .0.1 version numbers, which can take quite some time for users to download and install.
Now, Apple says its Rapid Security Response updates include important security improvements that “can be applied automatically between standard software updates.” MacRumors reports that...

对于 Mac mini 或 Mac Studio 用户来说不用花钱就可以拥有一个最好的摄像头，简直太值了！
还有 Deskview 模式，同时支持桌面上内容的显示(估计只有具有超广角摄像头的机型才支持)，这个功能也太有想象力了
目前比较不确定的问题是，这个 Continuity Camera 是不是只支持 FaceTime ，其他应用场景支持情况不知道是怎样的？</span>

迫于有机器人刷表单，需要一套验证码系统，思来想去，只有用 emoji 才能显得有个性(也更烦人)。
思路：
随机选择一些 emoji ，生成一张图片，计算指定 emoji 的数量，作为验证码的答案。

嗯...效果还不错，对人来说，门槛提高了，但是对机器人，几乎没有什么作用。
加入随机背景

随机角度

随机的偏移

感觉已经差不多了，再加入一个随机尺寸和随机比例



感觉已经可以防住大部分机器人了(可能还能挡住不少人类)</span>

目前我升级后，大概就两个地方有些问题，其他还好：
1. macbook 重新进行 xcode 安装，解决 git path 问题；
2. airpod pro 不能像之前那么顺畅，自由从 ipad 切换到 iphone ；（迟点试试重新配对）</span>

请问这次发布的 M2 的 Macbook(包括 Air 和 Pro)都不能外接两个 4k 显示器吗？
上一代 M1 Macbook 只有两个 type C 接口的版本都只能接一个 4k ，而 Mac mini 可以接两个 4k 。
这次 M2 还是这种策略吗？这算是强行阉割吗？

我们很高兴地宣布，2022 年 5 月发布的适用于 Visual Studio Code 的 Python 和 Jupyter 扩展现已推出！
在此版本中，我们加入了三个新扩展： Black 、 isort 和 Jupyter Powertoys 。
如果您有兴趣，可以在我们的日志中查看 Python、Jupyter和 Pylance扩展的完整更新内容。
Black
正如我们曾表示的，我们的团队正在努力将我们在 Python 扩展中提供的工具支持分解为单独的扩展，以提高性能和稳定性。
我们现在有了一个新的 Black扩展，即 Python 格式化程序。 与 pylint扩展类似，这个新扩展使用语言服务器协议来提供格式支持，并且它附带最新版本的 Black——因此您不再需要将它安装在 Python 环境中。
今天您可以通过从市场上安装这个新扩展来试用它。 然后打开一个 Python 文件，右键单击编辑器并选择&quot;Format document with ...&quot;。 您还可以从命令面板（ Ctrl + Shift + P 或 ⌘+ ⇧ + P ）运行&quot;Format document with ...&quot;命令。 如果您有任何问题或功能请求，您可以将它们提交到 GitHub 存储库。

Isort
我们还有一个新的扩展，可以使用 isort对导入进行排序。 当您打开文件并且您的导入不遵循 isort 的标准时，它将显示错误诊断并提供代码操作来修复导入顺序。

浏览器上的 Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter扩展现在可以安装为可以与 vscode.dev一起使用的 Web 扩展。 不过功能目前受到限制，仅支持在不需要 https 的 Jupyter 服务器上运行的笔记本（.ipynb 文件）。
如果您想试验该功能，请从本地计算机启动 Jupyter：

这种原生 gui 界面里的命令行显示 一般是怎么实现的？
有没有像 xtermjs 这种的库？
用 ui 库里基本的 text 之类的控件能扩展出来么？基本的发指令、显示结果好像可以，但是遇到那种 vim 编辑之类的估计没法搞了

不知什么时候下架的，我是最近开始用飞书的，能搜到 gitlab 助手的文档，但搜不到这个机器人就很恼火，问客服才知道下架了。
主要的目标还是配置简单，刚试了试钉钉里能添加 gitlab 机器人就很简单，两步搞定。
飞书倒是提供了“飞书捷径”，和“自定义机器人”，但是：
飞书捷径只支持 gitlab 官方，而里边的 webhook 没法解析 array ，发信息还不能直接往群里发，总之不太可用。
自定义机器人接收的格式和 gitlab webhook 发送的格式并不匹配，没法直接用。
于是我在想有没有一种服务，接收一种 webhook ，解析里边的 json 再拼成另一种格式发出去，不过什么也没搜到🤣
自己写一个服务做这样的中转当然可以，但太费事了。如果有现成的东西当然最好，所以来问问大家？
顺便吐槽飞书，作为颜值里最能打的，我发现很多功能和细节都不到位，而这已经是国内做的最好的了（无奈</span>

https://我是网址.com/my--&gt;马来文网站
https://我是网址.com/cn--&gt;简体中文网站
网站地图规划有二：
(一)网站地图路径一律放在 https://我是网址.com/sitemap.xml
网站地图档案网址为所有语言混合
(二)网站地图路径根据不同语言分别放,比如：
https://我是网址.com/sitemap.xml 只放英文版网址网站地图
https://我是网址.com/my/sitemap.xml 只放马来文版网址网站地图
https://我是网址.com/cn/sitemap.xml 只放简体中文版网址网站地图

还是没有差别?</span>

                              <span>czd670: 对于 webflux ，我的理解是在网络请求响应的时候，使用异步 IO ，基于 io 多路复用，提升系统吞吐量。在 controller 中，比如线程把 HttpRequest 给到 controller ，然后马上返回去处理其他任务，不用等待业务代码的执行。
我的疑问
1 、在我的业务逻辑中，使用到的数据库操作，也必须是异步非阻塞的吗？比如目前提供的 redis 、mongodb 、mysql 的支持库。还是说，其实这些异步库，可以用传统的同步阻塞方式去操作磁盘 IO 。（这样子做，webflux 的优势只发挥在网络请求的那部分）
2 、这些异步支持库，本质上是不是类似 nio ，通过监听 IO 事件，然后 attach handler 来完成整个业务逻辑？</span>

设备：iPhone 13 Pro
电池健康：99%
系统侧：
发热耗电。Beta1 没什么好抱怨的
锁屏不错，和 Focus 结合程度高
原来的壁纸全都被隐藏了，新系统的自带壁纸不具备夜间模式和 Live Photo 功能
iPhone Face ID 支持横屏解锁
Apple Watch 不升级也可以和 iOS 16 配合使用
软件侧：
据说飞书闪退，但我用企业微信一切正常
微信切换账号闪退，重新进入可以成功切换账号（稳定复现）
有趣的点：
iOS 16 锁屏运用了景深效果的壁纸，是时尚杂志行业中一个常见的排版手法，所以 Apple 官网的锁屏样例非常具有艺术性。详见： https://twitter.com/nishuang/status/1534012008424779777

上一年做了一个网站放在腾讯云的轻量服务器上，网站有做正规的备案手续。今年 8 月就到期了，发现续费太贵了。买的时候是 99 一年，续费差不多就 99 一个月。打算不续费了将网站放至 github+vercel 上。vercel 测试过速度还可以而且网站是一些基本的 html 。
不知道这样做是否有坑，备案是否要取消?如果迁移了网站是否需要通知通管局这些?</span>

介绍
Cloudreve 是一个能帮助对接多种存储策略的云端存储的文件管理终端，在之前 3.0 发布的时候采用 Golang 进行了重构，支持 6 种常用存储策略，并在最近的更新中带来了全新的上传体验，支持了断点续传等一系列新功能，可以查看我们的官网 https://cloudreve.org/ 了解更多 
现在，Cloudreve iOS 客户端也正式 release 了，这个客户端的实现完全从零开始编写，在 7 个月前我几乎没有任何 iOS ，Swift 的经验，但是现在在发布之前，主分支已经积累 700+ commit ，dev 分支超过 800 commit ，整体 App 架构采用 MVVM ，正在使用 TCA 重构，使用 Combine + UIKit 编写，尝试过使用 SwiftUI ，但是目前看来依旧不能完全达到要求，目前已经上架 App Store ，实现了 Cloudreve Web 端的大多数功能，对于少部分常用功能，像是文件分享管理，会在后续的版本迭代中带来。
Cloudreve iOS 客户端目前支持所有使用 Cloudreve 搭建的 site ，无论自用还是公开使用，考虑到每次版本更新会修复一些 bug 和带来一大波功能更新，目前只支持 Cloudreve 服务端最新版，没有必要停留在较老的版本。
更多详细信息和功能，可以访问官网客户端页面查看：https://cloudreve.org/ios
或者可以访问我们的官方论坛：https://forum.cloudreve.org/
或者 Github Repo：https://github.com/cloudreve/Cloudreve
关于定价
事实上，对于一个完全开源的 Cloudreve ，很难去找到一个平衡的价格，但是众所周知 App Developer 是存在订阅费用的，用爱发电不现实，平衡了 App 完成度和稳定性等多方面因素，我们决定采用 6 元 /月的订阅制，同时对年度订阅给予相应的折扣，其实扣除 Apple 抽成，到手几乎没有多少，相信这是一个比较合理且对于 Cloudreve 用户来说是一个完全可以接受的价格，另外提供了 3 天到 1 周的全功能免费体验，欢迎各位下载使用</span>

                              <span>这篇快速指南是为了帮助你修复 “yay error: while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.12” 错误。


如果你在系统中运行 Arch Linux 的时间比较长，那么由于其滚动发布性质以及你的硬件支持，程序可能会损坏。 如果你使用 AUR 助手 Yay，那么有时，由于其他软件包的多次安装升级，Yay 可能会损坏。

Yay 助手一般是非常稳定的，但有时它会被搞乱，在修复好之前，你不能使用它安装任何程序。而其中一个令人头疼的错误是这样的：

yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


这个错误特别是在升级到 pacman 6.0 后出现的，因为共享库不兼容。



如何解决 “yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.12”

这个错误只能通过完全卸载 yay 来解决，包括它的依赖。然后重新安装 yay。

没有其他方法来解决这个错误。

我们已经有一个 如何安装 Yay 的指南，然而，以下是修复的步骤。

从 AUR 克隆 yay 仓库并构建。在终端窗口中依次运行以下命令。

cd /tmp
git clone &#x27;https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git&#x27;
cd /tmp/yay
makepkg -si
cd ~
rm -rf /tmp/yay/


安装完成后，你可以尝试运行给你带来这个错误的命令。然后就好了。如果你仍然有这个错误，请在下面的评论区告诉我。

很多人都遇到了这个问题，网络上有 几个讨论。以上是解决这个错误的唯一办法。而且我在任何地方都找不到这个问题的确切根源，除了它是在 pacman 6.0 更新后开始的。

                              <span>想象一下，你坐在河边，河岸上如茵绿草，不远处湍急河流；午后的阳光慵懒惬意，使人陷入冥想哲思，不觉开始思考眼前的河流是否真实存在。诚然，几米外确实有河水奔流而下。不过，我们所称为“河流”的存在究竟是什么呢？毕竟，河水奔流不息，一直处于变化之中。似乎，“河流”这个词无法指代任何固定不变的事物。

2009 年，Clojure 的创始人 里奇·希基Rich Hickey 发表了 一场精彩的演讲，探讨了为什么上文那样的哲学窘境会给面向对象程序的编程范式带来难题。他认为，人们看待计算机程序中的对象与看待河流的逻辑是一样的：我们想象对象是固定不变的，即使对象的许多或者说全部的属性都无时无刻不处于变化之中。所以，这种逻辑并不正确，我们无法区分在不同状态下同一对象实例的不同之处。程序中没有明确的时间的概念。人们只是单纯地用着同一个名字，以期在引用对象时，对象能够处于预期的状态中。这样，我们也就难免会遇到 故障bug。

希基总结道，这一难题的应对办法就是人们应该将世界建模成作用于不可变数据的 进程process 的集合，而不是可变的对象的集合。换句话说，我们应把每个对象看作一条“河流”，因果相连。总结说来，你应该使用 Clojure 等函数式语言。



作者在远足途中思考面向对象程序设计的本体论问题。

自从希基发表演讲之后，人们对函数式编程语言的兴趣不断提升，主流的面向对象编程语言也大多都采用了函数式编程语言。尽管如此，大多数程序员依旧沿用自己的老一套，继续将对象实例化，不断改变其状态。这些人长此以往，很难做到用不同的视角看待编程。

我曾经想写一篇关于 Simula 的文章，大概会写到我们今天所熟知的面向对象的理念是何时又是如何应用到程序语言之中的。但是，我觉得写当初的 Simula 与如今的面向对象程序设计的 迥然不同之处，会更有趣一些，这我敢打包票。毕竟，我们现在熟知…</span>

                              <span>Linux Mint 接管了 Timeshift 备份/恢复工具的开发。你可以在它新的 GitHub 仓库中找到它。




Timeshift 可以说是 备份和恢复 Linux 系统的最佳工具。

Linux Mint 也利用它帮助用户在系统更新时更方便地创建快照，确保快捷无碍的操作。

当然，这不是 Linux Mint 可能比 Ubuntu 更好的唯一原因。

不幸的是，Timeshift 背后的开发者（Tony George）计划把注意力集中在其他项目上，将不再继续维护这个项目。

Linux Mint 团队联系了这位开发者，并愿意为这个项目提供任何可能的帮助。最终，它们接管了 Timeshift 的开发。

所以，现在 Linux Mint 团队会对 Timeshift 的发布和修复，以及任何与之相关的开发工作负责。

将 Timeshift 调整成 XApp



Linux Mint 倾向于将某些应用作为“XApp”来维护，以确保它们能在各种不同的桌面环境下工作，不会依赖于某个特殊的桌面。

考虑到他们计划将 Timeshift 调整成一个XApp，你可以期待该工具在很长一段时间内维持当前的外观和功能，而不用顾虑你的桌面环境是什么。

不像一些 GNOME 应用程序，为了获得最好的体验，它们通常会变成 GNOME 专用的应用程序。

Timeshift 是一个必不可少的备份/恢复工具。所以，Linux Mint 接管 Timeshift 的开发并作为一个 XApp 来维护的计划听上去相当完美！

如果你想知道的话，那不妨告诉你，Timeshift 的迁移已经在 Launchpad 上完成了。

新的 GitHub仓库（由 Linux Mint 复刻的）可以给你提供这个应用的更多细节以及它最近的开发活动。

你也可以在 最近每月发布的博文 中查阅官方对此的声明。

结语

作为 Timeshift 的维护者，Linux Mint 希望在不久的将来带来更多的新特性和改进。

你如何看待 Linux Mint 将 Timeshift 接管为一款 XApp？欢迎在下方的评论区内分享你的想法。

博客探索
2005 年，我开始用博客记录感想，发布在 MSN space 平台和短命的 Google Sidewiki 上。六年后，MSN space 关闭 ，博客被转移到 WordPress 托管，我改用 Blogger，没多久就暂停了博客。
2018 年，我偶然接触到 Jekyll，被其简洁的界面和便捷性打动，重新恢复了博客记录。博客方向从感想记录转变到知识整理输出。Jekyll 方案需要首先在本地用 Markdown 编辑排版，然后同步到 GitHub 发布，最后以 Markdown 格式手动分发到各个渠道。当文章较少时，这套方案的体验感特别好。
到了 2021 年，随着文章和发布渠道的增多，文章的修改和管理变得愈加困难。慢慢地，我开始习惯本地 Markdown 只做初稿排版，更新则只在外部平台上进行。
我的文章都是工具教程类，要随着工具的更新而修改，有时甚至要对几年前发布的文章进行更新。因此，针对少量平台更新的策略，带来了文章版本混乱，让博客偏离了知识记录的初衷。为了保证文章版本统一，我把博客从 Jekyll 迁移到 WordPress，准备以 WordPress 作为统一版。

然而，WordPress 方案很快就被放弃了。原因除了 WordPress 糟糕的编辑体验，更重要的是，我遇到了 Notion。其界面美观，编辑方便，支持对外展示，能导出为 Markdown、HTML 文件。
可是，没什么平台是完美的。Notion 不支持同步本地 markdown 内容，图床不能在站外使用，国内访问速度成谜。这令 Notion…</span>

这可能是我和女友自去年六月三亚回来之后，说的最多的愿望了。去年六月初，我们俩人趁着旅游旺季还没来临之前，特地请了4天的假期，搭上一个端午假期，才终于让我们期盼已久的海岛之旅成行。（辛苦打工人年中旅游实属不易啊🥲 ）
迟到了一年的海岛漫游指南，希望能给今年的你提供一些帮助。
海边日落-三亚湾
行前准备：天气预报可能是最不需要的东西🌤
5月中旬-10月中旬是海南的雨季，而且往往伴随着各类热带气旋的光临。我从做攻略开始就非常担心去玩的那一周天天下雨。如果你去查未来15天三亚天气预报，通常会看到这样一个劝退人的画面：
海南三亚6月未来15天天气预报
但其实海南的热带气候还是非常靠谱的。
预报下雨的一天可能只会间歇性地下1-2个小时的阵雨。趁着下雨在酒店瘫一会儿，出门就又是大太阳了。因此，千万别被天气预报劝退，在海南的雨季，一般的天气预报可能是最不需要的东西。我们去的那周甚至遇上了台风天，但是半天的狂风暴雨之后，一切正常。
唯一需要注意的就是要注意避开台风天入岛或出岛，以免长时间的途中延误。
怎么走：自驾，应该是体验海岛的最佳选择🚗
不同的出入岛方式可能会有不小的成本差异。
我们的选择是：
入岛路线：上海 - 直飞 - 三亚
出岛路线：三亚 - 高铁 - 海口；海口 - 直飞 - 上海
比起往返直飞三亚，可以省下约1000元的旅费。
出入岛的排列组合方式非常丰富，从海口到三亚的动车只需1.5小时，因此完全可以根据你的情况考虑海南的各个机场出入岛。
海南岛内交通示意
而对于岛内的出行，我个人只推荐一种：自驾。
三亚市内公共交通并不发达，而且大部分景点都在中心城区范围之外。
不论是公交还是打车，都会旅途带来不少的麻烦和不便。如果你有计划去免税店逛逛，我强烈建议自驾前往。免税店门口总有一堆人在排队打车，如果真的打车出行非常影响购物体验。
相对的，三亚的租车行业…</span>

Apple is adding a new feature to iOS 16 to make the Hidden and Recently Deleted albums in Photos much more private. Starting with iOS 16, those albums will now be locked by default, and you’ll be able to unlock them using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, according to Apple’s iOS 16 features page. 
In iOS 15, those albums are hard to find, but they they aren’t behind any protection. That means somebody who might have unwanted access to your phone can easily see what’s there if they know where to look — which somewhat defeats the purpose of the Hidden album in particular. With the change in iOS 16, people won’t be able to see photos in either album unless you unlock them. This new feature will also be available in iPadOS 16 and macOS...

Are you the kind of person who’d hesitate to charge gadgets from a public charger — like the ones coming to the seat of your plane? Apple’s first beta of the just-announced macOS 13 Ventura includes a feature seemingly designed to address tampering fears. It’ll make USB-C and Thunderbolt accessories explicitly ask for your permission before they can communicate with MacBooks powered by Apple’s M1 or M2 chips.
Here’s the full description of the feature from Apple’s release notes:
On portable Mac computers with Apple silicon, new USB and Thunderbolt accessories require user approval before the accessory can communicate with macOS for connections wired directly to the USB-C port. This doesn’t apply to power adapters, standalone displays,...

Update June 6th, 8:03PM ET: Costco has removed the landing page for its PlayStation 5 bundle, indicating it has sold out or is simply no longer available.
If you’re a Costco member, you now have another chance at nabbing Sony’s PlayStation 5 console. Right now, the retailer is selling the disc-based PS5 console in a bundle with an extra DualSense controller, a Pulse 3D wireless headset, a DualSense charging station, and four $25 PlayStation Store gift cards all for $789.99. If you want to take part but are not a member, you’ll have to purchase a Costco membership, which starts at $60 a year.


As always, double-check your billing and shipping address details are both correct, add the bundle to your cart, and try to check out as soon as...

Ever since the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro debuted with Apple’s own M1 silicon tech powering them in 2020, Mac laptops have experienced a small renaissance. The MacBook Air has returned to being an easy recommendation or de facto “no brainer” kind of purchase for most people, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro has become the final Touch Bar holdout once Apple revitalized its MacBook Pro line in 2021 with new 14- and 16-inch models. But now, after Apple’s recent WWDC announcements, we have a newly redesigned MacBook Air and a spec-bumped 13-inch MacBook Pro, both releasing in July.

Apple announced some major new features for Mail that finally bring the email app closer to parity with Gmail and other popular email clients. I personally rely on Mail on Mac for my work emails, and I think I’ll be taking advantage of many of these updates once they’re available.

Microsoft is testing some updates to the Microsoft Store on Windows 11 that will improve how updates are handled. Currently, some store apps will close and reopen while they’re being updated, which means you could lose work if you opened the Microsoft Store and selected update apps. Microsoft is now testing a change to the Store that will skip over updates for apps that are open instead.

For this reason, I have decided to share this publicly to denounce this kind of behavior and let the community judge if there is plagiarism or not.
Someone copied a part of my CSS Tricks article to submit their article on Smashing Magazine.
For this short version, I will simply share two demos to highlight the plagiarism
My demo: https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/ZEeYzNy
Her demo: https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/mdXRzRW
The author claimed that &quot;she didn&#x27;t plagiarize my article&quot; and &quot;she didn&#x27;t see my article before writing her article&quot;.
Sorry but my brain cannot accept this when I compare both demos. What do you think? Maybe someon…</span>

                              <span>The control which designers know in the print medium and often desire in the web medium is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace that the web doesn’t have the same constraints and design for this flexibility. But first, we must ‘accept the ebb and flow of things.’ — John Allsopp, “A Dao of Web Design”
John Allsopp’s insightful words have become a reflection of what we see now in CSS and other aspects related to web design. I am often perplexed about whether we influence the market or the market is influencing us. This cycle of change has led to the concept of responsive web design which is now playing an integral role in the lives of web developers (and designers).
Responsiveness is not a part of the web design checklist today, but is considered a de fa…</span>

                              <span>While digging into this accessibility journey, you might have heard me say a couple of times that semantics always win.
Before HTML5, we didn&#x27;t have all the fancy semantic elements like header, footer, or main. These kinds of elements were always described as plain divs with some markup.
That made it nearly impossible to define these elements as assertive technologies.
Hence WAI-ARIA comes to life.
You might be wondering what it even is, and it stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It&#x27;s a specification written by W3C defining a set of attributes you can use to provide additional semantics.
They are divided into multiple sections:
Roles: Can be defined by using role&#x3D;&quot;value&quot;


Properties: Give extra meaning to an element for example: aria-labelledby…</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s imagine we&#x27;ve got a class that does some heavy computations, since my imagination is limited, I will suggest a class that does counting (you can introduce something cooler in the comments, so I can stop embarassing myself):
class CountdownCalculator {
  public countDown(n: number): number {
    let count &#x3D; 0;
    while (count &lt; n) {
      count +&#x3D; 1;
    }
    return count;
  }
}
const countdownCalculator &#x3D; new CountdownCalculator();

So obviously the bigger number we pass, the more time it will be working. At some point we might want to memoize its results, so it case the method receives a number it has calculated previously, it simply returns the result right away.
Let&#x27;s call the method a couple of times and see how it goes:
for (let x &#x3D; 0; x++ &lt;&#x3D; 1;) {

We as a industry do a lot of lip service about being inclusive, creating welcoming environments, and making things a &#x27;fun place to be&#x27;. 
Yet, the industry can be tribal/hostile. 
Open source developers get attacked. 
Languages get mocked and practioners laughed at... like PHP, which runs 77.5% of the internet, or Javascript, which is 98% of the internet.
Framework tribes bubble up and thousands of bloggers write posts comparing the Reacts, Vues, Sveltes, vanilla (no links because not creating backlinks to THAT noise) and why only one shall reign supreme
Imposter Syndrome is real. With so many routes to becoming a developer (self-taught, to CS degrees, bootcamps), everyone is on extremely different wavele…</span>

Asteroid trivia is a frontend project developed in 36 hours for the codedamn hackathon. In the website, you can see real data from NASA about asteroids together with size and speed comparisons with Animals. More details down below :) 
We are computer science students at UNESP, São Paulo State University, our team is consisting of Cassiano Rodrigues who has a background in Sap and 1 year of Ruby, JavaScript, MySQL, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, AngularJS and React, Kauã Steliano who has experience of 2.5 years of Node.js, React Native and Typescript and Vinicius Fiedler with 1.5 years of C, C++, and python. 
Projects without themes are hard to start with but they stimulate our creativity. That is why in this project we think creatively and let our imagination flow. 
Asteroid Trivia has a clean design and a straightforward proposition: show information about asteroids but in a remarkably interesting way. But just showing large numbers does not make us aware of the magnitude of those space objects. 
For this reason, we decided to compare their data with animals&#x27; data.  For example, we show approximately how many aligned blue whales would be necessary to achieve the average asteroid’s diameter.
We used Nasa’s API Asteroids – NeoWs (Near-Earth Object Web Service) to get reliable data about asteroids including their id, name, diameter, speed, last approach, and if it is hazardous. 
We utilized the playground from Codedamn to develop the project with a better workflow.
The main technologies that we have used to create our web app were React.js, with some helpful libraries such as styled-components, to better organize our CSS code and application as a whole,  font-awesome to get pretty icons and Framer motion, to implement some neat planet animations. 🌌
We have also used Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to better organize our API calls and avoid code duplication. allowing us to communicate with APIs easily in our React apps.</span>

                              <span>Introduction:


We use comprehensions in simplifying code. If you take part in coding challenges like code wars, you would see answers using comprehensions. With comprehensions, it is possible to write one-liners instead of writing multiple lines of code in programming.
In this article, we are going to look into comprehensions in python, which includes list comprehension, dict comprehension, and set comprehension.
A list comprehension is a simpler and shorter way of writing code using a list. This could include a for loop and an if statement.
Example:
Let’s remove the first characters of a string from a list
Without list comprehension:
string_in_list &#x3D; [&#x27;aderin&#x27;,&#x27;agnes&#x27;,&#x27;anuli&#x27;,&#x27;aga&#x27;,&#x27;aderin&#x27;,&#x27;asabar&#x27;,&#x27;agnes&#x27;]str &#x3D; []
for i in string_in_list:
    str.append(i[1:])
print(str)

Output:

You&#x27;re given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so &quot;a&quot; is considered a different type of stone from &quot;A&quot;.
Example 1:
Input: jewels &#x3D; &quot;aA&quot;, stones &#x3D; &quot;aAAbbbb&quot;
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: jewels &#x3D; &quot;z&quot;, stones &#x3D; &quot;ZZ&quot;
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 &lt;&#x3D; jewels.length, stones.length &lt;&#x3D; 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
         int count&#x3D; 0;
        for (char jewel:jewels.toCharArray()) {

OpenWrt 的问题，ToH 中 Supported Current Rel ，有一些是 snapshot ，有一些是具体的版本号（例如 21.02.3 ）。 
我对整个硬件相关的生态都不了解，想请教一下大家。
“snapshot”的意思 是否 是“支持 snapshot 以及从旧到最新版本”，
然后“21.02.3” 是不是 指“22.xx 之后就不被支持了”。
还是说它们其实是其他意思？</span>

业务需求是这样，app 应用是有点赞，评论，at 我 评论 消息
现在用户量上来了，以前这些消息都存一个表 （ id,user_id,type （消息类型）,subject_id(类型)，readStatus(阅读状态)）
现在有差不多七百多万消息，每个人读取自己的未读消息数量 性能会下降，只能建立索引去 count idx(type,readStatus,user_id),目前做了 mysql 分区，按用户 hash 到 20 个分区上面，二级索引文件比较大
还有每个用户消息列表要拉取第一页消息 select * from message where user_id &#x3D; :userId and type&#x3D;:type order by create_time desc  这个语句也会建立索引
分表的话要还是要建立索引，不知道大家项目是不是这样做，还有发现分区和分表建立二级索引最大的区别是分区是在几百万数据建立索引，而分表是每个表都要建一个索引</span>

疫情以来经济下行的压力似乎作用在大家所能见到的所有的公司之上,从论坛上酷工作的板块的发帖数量的减少就能看出来.
所以希望各位 V 友能推荐一点前途比较好的公司,我觉得疫情期间还在业务扩张的公司应该可以算得上是前途较好的公司了吧:)

公司怎么样？
里面的同事大多是互联网大厂出来的，也有很大比例的海归。学历、工作经历都拿得出手。
是外企，所以对英语有一定要求，不过主要是书面的文档，要讲英语的场合很少，创始团队也大部分会说中文。
加班文化比互联网公司要好很多，比那些待遇低的外企要忙，不是很闲，但是你抓紧点做完也不用加班。
我们组 tech platform 在急招！组是做一些基础服务：账户管理、用户登陆管理、搜索、网关、通知的服务等等，有业务上的“基础服务”，也有一些技术上的“基础服务”，团队技术能力很不错。

对着屏幕久，眼睛有散光。晚上看 ipad 或手机都会难受（当然这会驱使更多地用 kindle ），想买个蓝光眼镜。
看过《我们为什么要睡觉》，里面提到：电子屏幕有蓝光，这种光波在一定程度上影响了人体内褪黑素的释放，导致睡眠紊乱，直接影响到了生物钟的正常工作。
大家有推荐的蓝光眼镜吗，功能和佩戴都比较好的那种。</span>

                              <span>brendanliu: 25 岁，三本院校（不在英国高校 list ），专业软件工程，绩点 3.7 ，去年咨询中介机构，商科 qs100 以内的院校有点难，100-200 之间的比较稳，计算机 qs100 以内录取比商科概率高；
毕业后从事云计算行业售前工程师，工作经验三年；家庭条件很普通，两套老破小，新一线城市，原计划打算用手头资金+卖一套老破小买一套新房结婚用，无对象，家里面有姐姐可以照看父母；
从小到大就想着出国读书，家里面父母也支持，但是家庭很普通，也不想让父母多操心；工作这几年，有点后悔没有考研，也想圆了自己从小到大的梦，自己在所在城市也有很多伤心事，加上自己已经攒够这一年的花销，从去年开始就萌生了去英国读一年硕士的想法，去年想读的专业是商业分析或者数据科学，今年想着还是需要掌握一门技术，想重新转码，毕业后一直从事售前相关工作，事业没有什么起色，代码能力几乎丧失，老哥们有没有推荐的专业或者其他建议？
今年 25 岁，下半年如果一切顺利，毕业大概 27 岁，时间成本也很高，可以的话，想留在当地工作，现在很迷茫。</span>

1.正常开机-重启电脑-主板 cpu 灯亮红灯-切断电源后再开机，主板 dram 灯亮一下绿灯然后正常开机
2.正常开机-重启电脑-主板 cpu 灯亮红灯-电脑自动重试三次然后关闭
之前发现主板 cpu 槽针脚有几个歪了，尝试了一下用针挑回来了，后面就是正常的，然后过几个时间出现第一种情况，当时以为是内存条问题，换了两根内存条也正常了，再过几个月又出现这种情况，现在基本上没法正常开机了
请问这种情况是针脚问题，还是内存槽问题</span>

我是通过 iptables 来控制应用联网，对应用进行 wifi 禁网或者移动数据禁网，平台是 mtk 。
禁用移动数据的规则是 iptables -A xxx_OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner 应用 UID -o ccmni+ -j REJECT
禁用 wifi 的规则是 iptables -A xxx_OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner 应用 UID -o wlan0 -j REJECT
禁用 wifi 的规则是没有问题的，但是禁用移动数据对于某些应用可以，某些应用不可以。不知道是不是 ccmni 这个接口的原因，ifconfig 查看接口有：
p2p0 、wlan0 、lo 、ccmni1 、ccmni0
我的规则
Chain xxx_OUTPUT (1 references)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
0 0 REJECT all -- * ccmni+ 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 owner UID match 10111 reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

用微信机器人弄了个吃瓜群，原理就是在各个群收集最新消息，所以机器人进的群越多，消息会越来越多，也越来越快。
进群无需付费，唯一条件就是需要拉机器人到一个大于 20 人的群，拉完后会自动把你拉到吃瓜群（拉到互助群或拉群后踢出机器人，会自动把邀请人也踢出吃瓜群的）。
机器人微信号 hopll98
如果想了解微信机器人的功能也可以看看我的项目 https://github.com/hanson/vbot

我曾经一心想着存钱，但是后来发现得有自己稍微和普通人不一样的爱好 只是宅在家 真的找不到对象的

一艘曾试图追溯 1620 年“五月花”号海上航行的无人驾驶的机器船，在五周之后，从英国到达了美国马萨诸塞州的普利茅斯岩。IBM 负责该项目的的一位主管说，“构成自主系统的技术工作得非常完美，毫无瑕疵”，但是“在机械上，我们确实遇到了问题”。这并不是它的第一次航行，去年它曾经因为故障而折返，而今年的航程也出现过一些故障，不过，好歹是到达了目的地。

老王点评：AI 在帮助自动驾驶机器了解其周围环境和自我驾驶方面越来越好，但当硬件出现问题时，大多数机器人没办法自己解决。不过，我在想，如果有一天他们连硬件故障也能解决的话……




谷歌研究在 Chromium 上安全使用 C++

谷歌 Chrome 安全团队在最近的一篇博文中说，“C++ 允许编写高性能的应用程序，但这是有代价的，安全……”。虽然如此，他们讨论了使用堆扫描技术来提高 C++ 的内存安全的历程，并提出了一些思路，基本的想法是把明确释放的内存放入隔离区，只有在达到一定的安全条件时才让它可用。在微软改用基于 Chromium 的浏览器之前，也曾在其浏览器中推出了这种缓解措施的版本。

老王点评：我倒是觉得，这或许给浏览器漏洞又打开了一道大门，为什么不用内存安全的语言呢。




让区块链管理能源使其不再浪费能源

区块链技术最被人诟病地方之一是其能源浪费，大多数区块链需要计算机反复进行无意义的计算。明显的解决方案是将区块链建立在有用的计算之上，该解决方案必须难以计算，但容易验证。本周发布的一篇论文提供了一种选择。优化问题在计算方面是出了名的昂贵，但解决方案的质量相对容易评估。这里被优化的系统是小型电网，在能源分配中存在需要优化的地方：供应与需求相匹配，找出最经济的发电源组合。随着能源市场逐渐分散化，管理复杂性也在相应增加，而小型子电网可以通过区块链的计算优化进行自我管理。

老王点评：这倒是一个有趣而值得探索的道路，不但可以部分解决能源浪费问题，而且有助于利用区块链的其它去中心化特性。</span>

                              <span>使用开源预算工具 Skrooge 让你的财务管理更加轻松。




2021 年，人们喜欢 Linux 的理由比以往任何时候都多。在本系列中，我将分享使用 Linux 的 21 个不同理由。本篇介绍的是个人财务管理。

个人财务可能很难管理。当你没有足够的钱在没有经济援助的情况下度日时，这可能是令人沮丧甚至不安的，而当你确实有所需的钱却又不清楚每个月的去向时，这可能会令人惊讶地难以接受。更糟糕的是，我们经常被告知要“制定预算”，好像宣布你每个月的花销就能在某种程度上体现出你需要多少钱。底线是：制定预算是困难的，没有达到你的财务目标是令人沮丧的。但这仍然很重要，Linux 有几个工具可以帮助使任务变得可管理。

理财

就像生活中的其他事情一样，我们都有自己的方法来跟踪我们的财务。我过去常常采取一种简单而直接的方法：我的薪水支票被存入一个账户，然后我会提取一定比例的现金。一旦我钱包里的钱没了，我就得等到下一个发薪日才能花钱。我用了一天没有午餐的时间，就明白了我必须认真对待我的目标，并相应地调整了我的消费行为。对于当时我的简单的生活方式来说，这是一种让我对自己的收入保持诚实的有效手段，但它并不能很好地转化为在线商业交易、长期公用事业合同、投资等等。

随着我不断完善我的财务跟踪方式，我了解到个人会计始终是一个不断发展的过程。我们每个人都有独特的财务状况，这告诉我们可以或应该使用什么样的解决方案来跟踪我们的收入和债务。如果你失业了，那么你的预算目标可能是尽可能少花钱。如果你在工作，但在还学生贷款，那么你的目标可能是向银行汇款。如果你在工作，但计划退休，那么你可能会尽可能多地存钱。

关于预算，要记住的一点是，它是为了将你的财务现实与你的财务 目标 进行比较。你无法避免一些开支，但在这些之后，你可以设定自己的优先事项。如果你没有达到你的目标，你可以调整自己的行为或改…</span>

                              <span>厌倦了 Windows 却买不起 Mac？这里有一份讲道理的最不坏发行版清单供你参考。


众所周知，所有的操作系统都很糟糕，只是有些比其他的更差一些。

在几乎在每一篇关于 Linux 的文章下都有这样的评论：有太多的发行版了，不知道该试试哪个。因此，我们觉得应该帮你简化一下，列出不同的发行版到底怎么样，告诉你它们在哪些方面很 糟糕。

由于 Distrowatch 目前列出了多达 270 个发行版，如果我们把所有的发行版都体验一遍，那简直是件不可能完成的事。因此，我们需要对这个列表做个瘦身。

如果你对这样的比较感兴趣，那么可能你还没有找到最喜欢的。

0. 小众而寂寂无名的发行版，我说的是全部

避免在所有的小众的发行版上费劲。原因如下：首先，它们很小众。没有多少人使用它们，所以你很难找到可以寻求帮助的人。其次，第三方硬件和软件可能无法开箱即用，如果你向供应商寻求帮助，无论是游戏、显卡还是打印机，他们都不会听说过 Ultimate SuperL33tOS 树莓派版。然后就完了。不要选它们，坚持主流。

1. ChromeOS Flex

年年都在喊 Linux 桌面年来了，然而根本没有人注意到它是不是来了 —— 也许是因为上面没有写 “Linux” 吧。ChromeOS 只能运行在 ChromeBook 和 ChromeBox 上，但在全球疫情大流行之前，它们的销量曾一度超过 Mac。“Flex” 是适用于普通 PC 的版本，大概因为它是 1.5 万亿美元的谷歌做的而因此得名吧。ChromeOS Flex 非常好用，因为它只做一件事：浏览网页。你不能安装应用程序，甚至不能安装安卓应用程序：只有官方套件才可以。你可以运行 Debian 容器：如果你知道这意味着什么，就去运行 Debian。如果你不知道这意味着什么，相信我们，你不会想知道的。

Writers are always looking for better ways to put their words and ideas into readable formats to share with their readers. My first experiences with word processing came in my Apple II days when I used AppleWorks and later FrEDWriter, which was a free word processing application created in 1985. It was the standard for my students, many of whom came from households that lacked the money to purchase proprietary software.

When I made the switch to Linux in the late 1990&#x27;s, I was looking for high quality writing software that I could use and recommend to students who chose to follow my lead in the world of open source software. The first word processor …</span>

The following article is a companion to my presentation at Drupalcon and Drupalcamp covering Progressive Web Apps implementations.
Progressive Web Apps (PWA) have support from some of the top tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, with the common goal being &quot;Web apps should be able to do anything iOS, Android, or desktop apps can.&quot; PWAs can add value to businesses at a variety of different stages. All projects have limitations, whether they be development resources, timeline, budget, or technical debt. Even with &quot;unlimited resources,&quot; developing an app from a single codebase, using commonly known web technologies, allows for a more frictionless, san…</span>

第一部分：理解对方。相较于《非暴力沟通》中的观察、行动、感受、请求等步骤的目的是通过用非暴力的表达方式让对方理解自己，即将介绍的「知觉检核」技巧更加倾向于带着一种开放的态度尝试去理解对方；第二部分：管理情绪。情绪看似是外力作用的结果，其实是知觉产生的想法所导致的结果；第三部分：展现自我。虽然自我的概念在很大程度上是由天性决定的，但在沟通的过程中可以被塑造，「自我袒露」的深度和广度决定着一段关系的亲密程度。
先对上篇文章《沟通的艺术｜学校错过的课程，现在补上也不晚》中提到的沟通的定义做个简单回顾：

人际沟通是一个交流的过程，其参与者们处于不同但又有所重叠的背景下，经由交换信息来创造价值和建立关系，过程中会受到外在、生理和心理的噪音干扰。

「不同背景」是沟通中客观存在的前提条件，「交换信息」是在沟通的过程中我们主动进行的行为，而「创造价值和建立关系」是我们「交换信息」的目的，或者是沟通这个行为产生的结果。上篇文章详细介绍了沟通的定义，和在「交换信息」时起到先导作用的「倾听」的技巧和注意事项。本篇文章的重点则是「交换信息」时本身的动作，了解人们理解信息的一般过程，以及「噪音干扰」会对「创造价值和关系」造成什么影响。
理想中的沟通

当我们倾听对方说话时，如果能意识到双方有着不同的背景，就可以明白为什么对方的某些行为让自己觉得无法理喻：因为不同的「教育/生活背景」差异会导致两人的知觉产生巨大的偏差。通过使用「知觉检核」技巧可以准确地理解对方；如果能意识到沟通会受到噪音干扰。我们就可以理解为什么在情绪上头时进行的沟通往往会造成让人后悔莫及的结果，因为我们的大脑会受到愤怒等「生理噪音」的干扰从而变的不那么理智。通过了解正确的「情绪管理」技巧能够帮助我们识别自己和对方的情绪并加以控制。
当我们尝试说服对方时，如果能意识到沟通会受噪音干扰，就可…</span>

                              <span>距离上一次更新，已经是两周前。因为换了个新环境，也需要处理很多事情，所以时间很紧，无法像之前那样有大把的时间获取和筛选各种信息、思考和主题式写作。
如果一个问题和道理总是反复出现在自己的反思里，那么这个问题就会逐渐得到自己的重视。我在 2 个多月以前，我也因为搬家没有时间写作，产生了焦虑。
焦虑的本质原因是「期待自我」与「现实自我」产生了较大距离。内心期待自己能每周更新深度的带有主题的内容，但现实的自我却因为时间紧做不到，而我又接受不了停更。
所以我的解决办法是：调整「期待自我」。去感受当下正在做事的价值。不苛责自己，顺应情绪脑和直觉，因为能轻易驱动身体这台沉重的机器的不是「理性脑」，而是「情绪脑」、「本能脑」，又因人作为动物，容易受环境影响，所以用心感受当下才能活得更自如。
我的笔记截图
让自己产生写作灵感的提问机器，往往藏在自己的亲历而非臆想中。我当时在搬家的时候，也曾深刻体会了「把指数型问题拆解成线型问题」的方法。
同样的，虽然最近没有时间去看更多的书籍和文章，但我仍然可以把我来到义乌的所见所闻，整理成一些可以分享的内容，给你看。一来，可以和正在阅读的你保持联系；二来，我也希望自己能通过完整文章的方式来整理我最近的思绪，让思考流动起来。
特别感谢我的女友，她给我说：你的专业的内容挺难读的，大家关心的其实不仅是你的内容，而是你这个活生生的人，你可以分享你的经历，即使不是事件的参与者，也能成为一个观察者。这有鼓励到我去摆脱之前的束缚，按照自己的意愿来分享自己所见所想。
接下来，我就试着分享一些我在新来的城市——义乌的所见所闻。
🏠 义乌的租房
来义乌住下酒店后，我们一边处理新的仓库工作，一边找房子。义乌租房和其它地方不一样，大多按年租来付款的。如果想按月租，只能去城中村的库存街里去问。

                              <span>从去年传出退出中国流言开始，到近期靴子落地，宣布正式退出中国，Kindle这个过于专注的电子阅读器，终于还是敌不过多变的市场。亚马逊溃败中国，跨境电商和Kindle是坚持运营的两大业务。数据显示，自2016年起，中国便已经成为了Kindle设备销售的全球第一大市场，关停服务无疑会影响无数用户的生活。
关切、怀念、告别，今天就用这一文章说一说，不过首先还是来一番文化批评，说说阅读这件事。
阅读的定义早已改变，功利主义让Kindle显得难能可贵
从任何一个角度来说，我都不是一个读书的人。不喜欢读书，有很多理由，从应试教育开始养成的功利主义，天然让我们抗拒读书这件事，另外便是没有时间，或者说精力，让我们在这个缺乏注意力、非常疲惫的时代，给它多分配一点。
但这说的是读书，假如说更为宽泛的阅读，其实我并不惭愧。仅在知乎一个平台，我每年的阅读量都能达到几十万字，有一年甚至相当于《四库全书》。当然，你可以说这是碎片阅读，但是它的确开始受到承认，在今年我国发布的读书日白皮书中，互联网化的阅读也算入了其中，大大拉升我国成年人的阅读数据表现。
阅读的内涵在扩大，当然你还可以说，除了知乎、公众号之外，还有各种形式的内容消费，其内在都是严密文本作为基础的，比如这两年开始的风气就是文字转视频，做公众号的都开始做视频，当然还有各类播客、有声书等等。甚至来说看电影前读的豆瓣影评都可以是一种阅读。
前些日子，奥迪抄袭一位短视频自媒体博主的文案上了热搜，从常规的语境下看，那条短视频就是分享节气的内涵解读，但是在奥迪抄袭包装以后、影帝刘德华念出来以后，大家都觉得是极其有文化的、充满文学气息的文案。
结果反转，尤其是那首所谓曾国藩的诗，从来抄袭源一错到底，让人倍感讽刺。
我们的浮躁和功利主义，它的演化路径，从一个贩售读书文化的商人创业故事就能看清楚，这个人就是梁文道。最早凤凰卫视挖掘他，每天下午给他8分钟时间做…</span>

前言
谈到 Android 架构，相信谁都能说上两句。从 MVC，MVP，MVVM，再到时下兴起 MVI，架构设计层出不穷。如何为项目选择合适架构，也成常备课题。
由于架构并非空穴来风，每一种设计都有其存在依据。唯有高频痛点熟稔于心，才能技术选型事半功倍。所以今天我们一起探寻 “架构演化” 来龙去脉，相信阅读后你会豁然开朗。

原始图形化架构
完整软件服务，通常包含客户端和服务端。
Linux 服务端，开发者通过命令行操作；Android 客户端，面向普通用户，须提供图形化操作。为此，Android 将图形系统设计为，通过客户端 Canvas 绘制图形，并交由 Surface Flinger 渲染。

Brock announced that Coinbase is putting a pause on hiring new employees, as well as rescinding several job offers already accepted by prospective workers, citing “current market conditions and ongoing business prioritization efforts.”
The shift comes as the cryptocurrency market continues to trend downwards, dragging the supposedly immovable stablecoins, which are pegged to a fiat currency or commodity, with it. Coinbase started to slow hiring in mid-May to make sure the company is “best positioned to succeed during and after the current downturn,” but this move halts hiring completely. Brock notes that the freeze will also...

Apple is poised to reveal a new MacBook Air at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, but even if it does, you may not be able to immediately buy one. According to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, COVID-19 shutdowns at the Chinese plants that make MacBooks might mean a limited supply of new devices or a release date that’s further off.
China’s zero-COVID policy has led to the temporary closure of factories that make Apple products, including Pegatron and Quanta. Although China has begun to relax some of the movement restrictions it initially reinstated in March, some neighborhoods in Shanghai still remain under lockdown. 
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to ship about six to seven million new MacBook...

After a long, long month of laptop releases, Computex 2022 is finally over. In some ways, it’s the Computex that wasn’t.
The early part of this year was an exciting time to be a laptop reporter. Every company and its mother announced that big ideas were on the way. Wacky products abounded, from monitors to phones. LG Display (which supplied the 13.3-inch panel for Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold) showed off a 17-inch foldable OLED screen. We saw RGB, OLEDs, and haptics galore. Chipmakers promised architectural innovations and performance gains. We were told that these were all coming soon.
At the end of May was Computex, the biggest laptop-specific show of the year. (Well, it really was all of May — since many global attendees couldn’t get to...

Three Chinese astronauts, or taikonauts, arrived at the Tianhe core module of the unfinished Tiangong space station on Sunday morning, where they’ll stay for six months to help finish its construction (via Space.com). The Shenzhou 14 spacecraft took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert on Saturday at 10:44PM ET (10:44AM local time) and docked with Tianhe at 5:42AM ET (5:42PM local time).
The three-person crew includes Chen Dong, Cai Xuzhe, and Liu Yang, who originally made history as the first Chinese woman in space during the country’s Shenzhou 9 mission in 2012. While they’re in orbit, the crew is expected to conduct several spacewalks and prepare the station for the arrival of two additional lab modules,...

                              <span>Following a few months of gritty warfare — and a live event last night starring a giant mech — the latest season of Fortnite is surprisingly laid-back. In fact, season 3 of the game’s third chapter is called, simply, Vibin’. It brings with it some notable changes to the island, including new locations like an amusement park — complete with a rollercoaster — as well as a trippy-looking forest called Reality Falls that features magical saplings players can plant and grow for better loot.
Here’s a closer look at how the western edge of Fortnite’s island looks now:
Gameplay-wise, the season brings back a fan-favorite vehicle, the Baller (which looks a bit like a giant hamster ball). It has been tweaked slightly, though: it has...

关于用人类的精子来制作出的生命体何蒙库鲁兹的视频
觉得视频有意思的话请大家多多给我点关注以及三连~！！！



很多人们问我，这些已经辟过谣了。你为什么还做成了视频。
原因就是如下
我一开始我向朋友听到关于已被辟谣了的人造生物的内容时
我就认为这些内容怎么可能是真的，肯定是假的呀!!因为以科学和医学的角度来说
这些完全是不可能发生的事!
这么想
可是那天我回家的路上突然觉得
&#x27;我们所信任的东西，难道全都是对的吗??&#x27;
人类才几百年前还一直认为地球是平的，并还认为&#x27;人&#x27;是神创造出

Coreboot 是一个自由开源的 BIOS 实现，支持许多被称为“载荷”的扩展。用户可以通过选择不同载荷来自定义 BIOS ROM 所包含的功能。在刚刚发布的 Coreboot 4.17 中，除了支持新的主板、提供新的启动程序、支持 AMD 平台安全启动、有一些修正之外，还有……一个 1993 年的移植版 Doom（毁灭战士）游戏。虽然有些“小小”的不足，比如没有声音、不能保存游戏、退出游戏时系统会挂起，但是他们说，“如果你厌倦了太空入侵者和俄罗斯方块等游戏载荷，将 3D 游戏带入你的 BIOS，是一个很棒的新选择！”

UNISOC 固件中的一个关键缺陷可阻断通讯

研究人员发现，攻击者可以向附近带有 UNISOC 固件的设备发射一个特别设计的无线电数据包，可以使固件崩溃，在设备重新启动之前，会终止该设备的蜂窝网络连接。事实证明，这个缺陷不仅适用于低端智能手机，而且也适用于一些智能电视。研究人员说该漏洞是在 UNISOC 芯片组的固件中，而不是在安卓操作系统中。UNISOC 是一家有 21 年历史的芯片设计公司，总部设在中国，是世界上第四大智能手机芯片商，仅次于联发科、高通和苹果。

谷歌助手正在失去基于位置的提醒

这些是非常有用的命令，你可以告诉谷歌助手，比如，“提醒我回家后把垃圾倒掉”，而你的手机一直在追踪你的位置，当你进门时就会提示你。现在谷歌正在发出通知，告诉用户这项功能已经失效，而建议采用定时重复的提醒替代。目前还不清楚为什么谷歌突然要砍掉一个有用的、易于使用的功能。

                              <span>机器学习（ML）就是，分析一组数据以预测结果。Python 被认为是 ML 的最佳编程语言选择之一。在本文中，我们将讨论使用 Python 进行分类的机器学习。




假设你想教孩子区分苹果和橙子。有多种方法可以做到这一点。你可以让孩子触摸这两种水果，让他们熟悉形状和柔软度。你还可以向她展示苹果和橙子的多个例子，以便他们可以直观地发现差异。这个过程的技术等价物被称为机器学习。

机器学习教计算机解决特定问题，并通过经验变得更好。这里讨论的示例是一个分类问题，其中机器被赋予各种标记示例，并期望使用它从标记样本中获得的知识来对未标记样本进行标记。机器学习问题也可以采用回归的形式，其中期望根据已知样本及其解决方案来预测给定问题的实值real-valued解决方案。分类Classification和回归Regression被广泛称为监督学习supervised learning。机器学习也可以是无监督unsupervised的，机器识别未标记数据中的模式，并形成具有相似模式的样本集群。机器学习的另一种形式是强化学习reinforcement learning，机器通过犯错从环境中学习。

分类

分类是根据从已知点获得的信息来预测一组给定点的标签的过程。与一个数据集相关的类别或标签可以是二元的，也可以是多元的。举例来说，如果我们必须给与一个句子相关的情绪打上标签，我们可以把它标记为正面、负面或中性。另一方面，我们必须预测一个水果是苹果还是橘子的问题将有二元标签。表 1 给出了一个分类问题的样本数据集。

                              <span>如果你使用 apt 命令在终端中安装软件包，你将看到各种输出。

如果你注意并查看输出，有时你会注意到一条消息：

package_name set to manually installed


你有没有想过这条消息是什么意思，为什么你没有在所有包上看到它？让我在本篇中分享一些细节。

理解 “软件包被标记为手动安装”

当你尝试安装已安装的库或开发包时，你会看到此消息。此依赖包是与另一个包一起自动安装的。如果删除了主包，则使用 apt autoremove 命令删除依赖包。

但是由于你试图显式安装依赖包，你的 Ubuntu 系统认为你需要这个包独立于主包。因此，该软件包被标记为手动安装，因此不会自动删除。

不是很清楚，对吧？以 在 Ubuntu 上安装 VLC 为例。

由于主 VLC 包依赖于许多其他包，因此这些包会自动安装。



如果你检查名称中包含 vlc 的 已安装软件包列表，你会看到除了 VLC，其余都标记为“自动”。这表明这些软件包是（跟着 vlc）自动安装的，当 VLC 被卸载时，它们将使用 apt autoremove 命令自动删除。



现在假设你出于某种原因考虑安装 vlc-plugin-base。如果你在其上运行 apt install 命令，系统会告诉你该软件包已安装。同时，它将标记从自动更改为手动，因为系统认为在尝试手动安装表明你明确需要此 vlc-plugin-base。



可以看到它的状态已经从 [installed,automatic] 变成了 [installed]。



现在，让我删除 VLC 并运行 autoremove 命令。你可以看到 vlc-plugin-base 不在要删除的软件包列表中。



再次检查已安装软件包的列表。vlc-plugin-base 仍然安装在系统上。



你可以在这里看到另外两个与 VLC 相关的包。这些是 vlc-plugin-base 包的依赖项，这就是为什么它们也存在于系统上但标记为 automatic 的原因。

我相信现在有了这些例子，事情就更清楚了。让我给你一个额外的技巧。

将包重置为自动

如果包的状态从自动更改为手动，你可以通过以下方式将其设置回自动：

sudo apt-mark auto package_name




结论

这不是一个重大错误，也不会阻止你在系统中进行工作。但是，了解这些小事会增加你的知识。

好奇心可能会害死猫，但它会让企鹅变得更聪明。这是为这篇原本枯燥的文章增添幽默感的原始引述 : )

如果你想阅读更多这样的文章，这些文章可能看起来微不足道，但可以帮助你更好地了解您的 Linux 系统，请告诉我。

                              <span>This is a 2-part series on graph data structures. In this first part we are going to learn about the various parts and terminologies used in graph, we will look at the types, uses and applications of graphs. While in part 2 we shall look at graph representation and build a graph in Javascript code.

 


  
  
  Definition


A graph is a non-linear data structure made of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes to simulate a network. Graphs are used to show the relationship between sets of data.
 


  
  
  Terminologies


The following are some of the commonly used terms in graph data structures:

Vertex: This refers to a singular node in a graph; a vertex can be any form of data; a name, number, or co-ordinate. [M,A,Q,Z,N] are vertices. The plural for vertex is vertices.

up: move the cursor up
down: move the cursor down
right: Enter into directory
left: Leave directory
For vimmers, h, j, k, l are mapped to the arrow keys as you&#x27;d expect from any vim inspired program.
Press / and then type any regular expression to search files and folders in the current working directory.
While in search mode, you can use up or ctrl-p to move the cursor up, and down or ctrl-n to move the cursor down. Use left, right keys to enter into or leave directories without leaving the mode.
When you are done, press enter or escape to leave the search mode.
Alternatively, install fzf.xplr if you are a fzf user. Or install zoxide.xplr to be able to jump between your most visited directories using zoxide.
Type g g to jump to the top and G to jump to the bottom.
Type any number (let&#x27;s say n) and then,
press enter to jump to a certain index.
press up or k to jump n lines above the cursor.
press down or j to jump n lines below the cursor.
Press ctrl-o to jump to the previous jump location, and ctrl-i to jump to the next jump location, like you&#x27;d do in vim.
Type g f to follow symlinks into their actual path.
Press g p and type or paste a path to go into that path (if directory) or focus on it.

So whenever you need to revise kubernetes you can read through it for 5 minutes and you are up and running like a container 😅. So lets get started!
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration system which is used to automate deployment, scaling and management of containerized application.
Why we need kubernetes ?
Automatic bin packing
Service discovery and load balancing
Storage orchestration
Self Healing
Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks
Secrets and configuration management
Batch Execution
Horizontal Scaling

  Why did it take this course?


I decided to take this course, right after I finish my first Javascript course. At that time I felt that even though I knew some Javascript I did not know how to start applying them in my projects.
I wanted to see how javascript was being used in different projects and situations and also to get some inspiration and ideas.
So the title of this course was the first thing that took my attention because it sounds exactly what I was looking for.
Sharpen your skills by building 50 quick, unique &amp; fun mini projects, is the description of this course, created by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
The idea of this course is simple but really nice, 50 projects that you can do in 50 days. Most of the projects are sh…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
Are you a developer? Do you use MySQL? Which client do you use? Probably one of MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, Navicat or Sequel Pro?
Right. If you are like me you must have wondered why all the clients are so clunky? Why are they so painful to use?
I have been working with MySQL for a few years now and was sick of using available clients. So I did what any self-respecting developer does: I built my own client! You want to check this out:https://prosql.io .
If you are thinking the name sounds similar to Sequel Pro, then you are absolutely right! Prosql (read: pro-sequel) is inspired by Sequel Pro which, sadly, runs only on Mac and does not support MySQL 8.0. I started with a goal to make a cross platform (and better) Sequel Pro. I think I have succeeded to a large extent. Here are the to…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be honest with you, I&#x27;ve made this mistake we will look at in this article many times before.
The mistake we are talking about is content flow. In simple terms, which direction does your content flow in?
When we write our code, there is some semantic follow-up.
1
2
3
4

As you can see, these divs are represented in a logical order in the dom.
However, with the magical powers of CSS, we can manipulate the order and reverse it.
flex-direction: column-reverse;.
Now the visual user will see the following flow:
4
3
2
1

You might think, alright, but why does that matter?

In the video above, we can see the keyboard navigation focusing on the correct flow, but for a visual representation, it&#x27;s super unclear why the flow we see isn&#x27;t represented.
You can even try it yourself in this CodePen.





  
  
  When to be careful?


So, while writing this article, I looked at my website and still reversed some visual elements.
Including my mobile article cards, they switch around the image and the title visually.
Although, I&#x27;ve reached out to some accessibility experts to get their opinion on it.
My guidance at this point is never to change the focus order from the source order.
Try and navigate through your website. Is the tab order the same as the visual order?
You&#x27;ll be surprised by how many modern websites the tab order is wrong.

Under the Hood
So today’s story begins and is encouraged by the process of learning about blockchain development. In fact, the last 10–12 stories are more about blockchain development because I am sharing while learning.
I feel good to learn the new stack and technology and share it with you my audience asap, it just brings satisfaction once that publish button is pressed 😁.
Getting Started
Blockchain data is immutable, consistent, open-access for everyone, permanent and most importantly secured. Because of this blockchain will certainly be the future of the applications.
And one use-case of the blockchain is storing consistent data, for example, citizens&#x27; identity documents such as Aadhar Card(for India). Currently…</span>

Below is also attached a short demonstration video for the project.

                              <span>It is well-known that a proxy determines the relationship between a user and a web server (or a website). But it is the traffic flow direction that defines who benefits from this relationship: a user or a web server. In case of a forward proxy, users have all the perks: they hide behind a proxy, maintain anonymity, and have access to the geo-restricted content, all while conducting excessive business tasks, such as web scraping or multi-accounting. A reverse proxy helps to process requests and protect anonymity as well but in contrast to a forward proxy, the main beneficiary is a web server (or a website).

                              <span>dry-rb is a fascinating set of tools and libraries, but their usage may not be readily apparent. Why might one add these libraries when there are perhaps much simpler techniques that will suffice? What is the reasoning behind the abstractions, and what gains might they afford us that could make a case for their inclusion?
Well that&#x27;s what this series is. We&#x27;re going to take a look at a few more non-trivial examples and explain the reasoning behind why one might want these tools, because there are most certainly cases where the incurred complexity becomes very cost-positive indeed.
In order to build the intuition there though, we first need to explore a bit of theory.
Perhaps one of the most powerful single concepts in programming, and one we so often take for granted, is the HTTP Response …</span>

                              <span>夏天，大概就是阳光、小裙子、微风和——满满一冰箱的冰饮料！
其实 4 月末的时候深圳已经差不多进入夏天了，在家晒太阳喝无糖饮料的日子已经过了一个多月，终于想写写这些幸福时光🥰
记得刚来深圳的时候，我喝奶茶还要全糖，不理解一切降低甜度的人，甜点儿不好吗？
现在……已经不怎么喝奶茶了，甜点儿的东西都觉得腻，平时最常喝东方树叶，奶茶类饮料喝就是无糖或微微甜。夏天有一阵子喜欢喝柠檬茶，点邻里的柠檬茶最是离谱，他家外卖会自己标自己的无糖柠檬茶「非常难喝」，其实我喝着还不错来着…… ┓( ´∀&#x60; )┏
总之，这篇文章就写一下，夏天喝起来清爽无负担的那些夏日冰饮~
（所以这么看来这有可能是一篇测评
注：严格意义上来讲，这里写的饮料主要指不另外加糖的。以及，由于个人不喜欢代糖的味道，不写代糖产品~
我为夏天打下的江山
茶饮料
东方树叶  4.2元/瓶
真爱！一天可以喝 1-2 瓶的那种，每次从冰箱拿出来都觉得很幸福。
一般是京东或者天猫超市买，15 瓶一箱 64 元，均价 4.2元/瓶，500ml 一瓶。
最好喝的！
最喜欢茉莉花茶的，其次是绿茶。之前出了小瓶装的雨前龙井也很好喝，不过好像是季节限定，只喝过一次后面就没见过了。
只喝过一次的季节限定
玄米茶也还行，味道……总感觉更适合秋冬。青柑普洱是个人最不喜欢的一款……
三得利乌龙茶  3.8元/瓶
乌龙茶里超多好评的一款。我不太喜欢乌龙茶，所以其实感觉一般般，不过公司饮料柜没有矿泉水的时候，也会喝这个。
看了一下京东，57 元一箱 15 瓶，均价 3.8元/瓶，500ml 一瓶，也还不错。

最近又喝到了三得利的茉莉乌龙茶，感觉比纯乌龙更好喝（可能我是茉莉真爱），均价 4.9元/瓶，贵了一点点。但是值得试试！
图就很好看
冷泡茶  ？/瓶
茶叶放矿泉水瓶里冰箱冷藏过夜。家里倒是有明后毛峰的野茶，我也只是买茶叶的时候看到据说有这种喝法，…</span>

我有一个国内域名，备案了，子域名解析了一个国内的 ip 地址，用做中转出国，最近发现在部分地区比如上海电信，时不时这个子域名会出现 dns 污染，解析到了 8.7.198.X ，这时候的情况为：
1 、拿到 ipip 去 ping 了下看，有少数部分地区 dns 污染，大部分地区解析正常
2 、换公共 dns 比如 223.5.5.5/114 解析正常
3 、过段时间后 dns 污染解除，解析正常
这种是啥情况？是 GFW 还是部分地区的运营商自己的行为？为啥国内域名也会这样</span>

题主先来,基础信息
iPad Pro 12.9 2021 款
秒控键盘
Apple Pencil 二代
iPadOS 15.5
对在用 iPad/iPadOS 满意的地方
系统长期稳定
屏幕优秀
音响效果好
手写笔与键盘操作优秀
对在用 iPad/iPadOS 不满意的地方
M1+Mini LED 的屏幕，电池续航很不理想
隔空投送的少见文件格式，需要有能打开的指定软件保存
分屏与小窗的操作逻辑稍微复杂了点
太重
回收铝外壳不是很可靠（题主出现过 iPhone 掉到 iPad 边缘砸了一个小坑出来的情况）
希望 iPad/iPadOS 能改变 /优化的地方
开放高权限的终端，开放 iPad 本地开发
提升硬件可靠度（不戴壳使用起来很爽）
减轻重量（妙控键盘太重）
增加 iPad 摄像头使用场景
新增官方计算器</span>

卡的点不是页面，而且 table 点击添加背景颜色，和鼠标移入添加背景颜色。 这两个点特别卡顿。
有个需求就是，打开页面所有列都要显示出来。
我是刚接手的项目，就做一个小小的迭代，就要我去做优化。业务逻辑大概了解了，但是里面的代码逻辑还没怎么了解完成。就让我写优化报告，说一下怎么优化，优化哪些东西。 
我去问一个前辈（这个项目他之前负责的，现在他在做别的项目重构）怎么优化，人家直接说，这个东西根本优化不了，页面不卡，就你一个点击事件和鼠标移入移出的功能卡。而且这两个都是组件里面写死的。
我实在不知道该怎么优化了。特地来求助大佬们</span>

我们组有一个由 rollup.js 打包和发布的前端库。 如果其他团队不给相应的工时，我们希望这个 nodejs 模块被无法访问，但我们不能限制用户从 Nexus 下载这个模块。
我怎样才能实现这个目标呢？ 我想知道是否有一种方法可以通过 rollup.js 对构建的模块进行加密并拥有密钥，只有付费的人才能在 webpack 中解码。 有什么建议么？</span>

在虚拟机里面开录屏的话，卡卡的。
在外面开录屏的话，划一个区域，也只能专专心心操作虚拟机，占着位置，录到一半想看其他的软件，只能暂停录屏，导致不连贯。
突然想起，没显示器的时候，我一般用采集卡+OBS 可以查看树莓派或电视盒的画面。用 OBS 录虚拟机的话，没折腾过硬件直通，不知道能不能把 HDMI 口交给虚拟机，然后输出到电脑的 USB 口，主机开 OBS……好复杂，还要插线。有没有软件可以把虚拟采集卡模拟出来?</span>

我们身边已经有了很多像 Google 、Windows 、互联网、淘宝，等用于查找信息、使用计算机，上网和电子商务等服务。也有了飞机、汽车、手机等日常生活中非常依赖的工具和设施。
唯有创意不能简单的依赖这些工具和服务批量生产。
创意能够让我们兴奋，愉悦，也可以创造出更好的产品或服务。
在这里希望大家展开思考和想象，把你认为比较好的创意分享出来，让大家一起头脑风暴，最终也会会碰撞出一个伟大的创意。
我近期业余在考虑投资一家具备网红潜质的甜品店，这个地方首先位置、环境和设施已经足够吸引人，可以成功吸引大量的人前来打卡、朋友圈分享照片，通过口碑传播的方式产生更多用户前来拔草。
我还考虑在甜品店里面打造 1-2 款爆款甜品，1-2 款爆款饮品。引入包月会员畅吃、畅饮创意，打造一个基于会员体系的中高端甜品店。
当然还会有跟多的细节和建议，不再次赘述，你也可以就此提出你的建议。也可以分享与此创意无关的，你的创意。</span>

2 、在服务器上使用 trz 上传文件，使用 tsz path_to_file 下载文件。

在 Release 中下载的 zip 压缩包里就是三个 trzsz、trz、tsz，可以直接运行，也可以自己 clone 下来 make 编译。
附个效果：

大致确定的路线：
1. 从南平市入闽：武夷山九曲坐竹筏、看场老谋子的印象大红袍、买点茶叶。感觉爬不动山。
2. 福州市：逛三坊七巷，平潭岛环岛骑一圈，希望能碰到蓝眼泪。吃佛跳墙、鱼丸、四果汤、扁食。
3. 泉州市：参照 /t/856627 ，泉州十八景
4. 厦门市：逛集美、鼓浪屿，吃姜母鸭、土笋冻，海鲜就算了，青岛吃了好多。然后飞机✈回上海。
5. 还想去土楼来着，感觉有点远了。
6. 欢迎补充！</span>

距离上一次正儿八经的技术文章已经过去了三个月，这段时间里除了上一篇文章提到的换工作以外（入职字节跳动，和下一步的计划）。经过两个多月的面试，我的 GDE (Google Developer Expert) 申请也完成了所有流程，成为了国内第 5 位 Flutter &amp; Dart 方向 GDE。
下方是收到的所有流程邮件，按倒序排列。从资质评估、两轮面试，再到协议签署的最终确认。

成为 GDE 可以获得什么？
引用 恋猫de小郭：从台下到台上，我成为 GDE（谷歌开发者专家） 的经验分享 中的总结：
GDE 是 Google 在全球范围内开展的一个开发者专家认证项目，成为 GDE 除了是对你的技术和影响力认可之外，你还可以获得：
提前获悉谷歌内部产品路线或者技术变更的相关信息；
直接和 Google 产品团队沟通技术问题，获得一些 Google 内测资格；
谷歌活动邀请，如 I/O 大会并报销差旅；
JetBrains 会为所有 GDE 提供免费的 JetBrains 全家桶；
我能成为 GDE 么？
看到上面的诸多好处，在心动的同时你可能心里也在想：
我能成为 GDE 么？
我在去年读到 Alex 分享我成为 GDE（Google 开发者专家）的经历 文章时，也是一样的状态。
心理上的设障可能是阻止我们前进的最大因素。
当我回过头看整个申请过程，可以很确定和大家说：
是的，每个人都有成为 GDE 的机会
在我看来，「GDE 是 Google 对于你在某项技术上所做出贡献的认可，更加看重你的技术影响力」。这个项目并不考察学历，公司，人人都有机会成为 GDE。
所以他难么？他没有任何门槛，只要你足够热爱某项技术并且愿意付出。
但他不难么？你可能在想技术贡献如何进行评估？下面和大家分享下我整个申请过程的准备。
我该如何准备成为 GDE

Android 10 首次引入了全局返回手势，但直到返回触发才能看到目标上层画面。13 针对该特性进行了优化，即返回触发之前可以预览上层画面。同时彻底废弃了返回键相关的 API，这将对现有的 App 逻辑产生巨大的影响！
前言
Android 13 针对包括手机、大屏、折叠屏等 Android 设备推出了可预见型返回手势（Predictive Back Gesture）特性。该特性将便于用户在返回完成之前可以先预览到目标画面或结果，这样的话可以允许他们决定是否要继续返回或者放弃并停留在当前画面。

另外引入关于 KEYCODE_BACK KeyEvent 相关的一系列变更。
为节省篇幅和统一认识，后续的相关描述将按照如下规则简称：
本次引入的可预见型返回手势 + KEYCODE_BACK 系列变更：统称为新返回导航
KEYCODE_BACK KeyEvent：简称为 KEYCODE_BACK
传统导航模式和 Swipe-Up 导航模式下的返回按钮：简称为Back KeyButton
全局返回手势：简称为Back Gesture
Back KeyButton

背景
年初开始我们就开始了关于Gradle Sync阶段的优化。之前和大家都简单的介绍过工程相关的背景情况了，我们大概有400+的Module，然后一次的同步时间就非常的慢，我们迫切的需要对这个问题进行优化。大部分工作都是和团队内的同学一起完成的，我也只出了一点点力而已。
这次写文章真的很倒霉，之前忘了保存导致要重新开始写了。如果不是白嫖了掘金的端午礼盒，拿人手短啊，我已经打算鸽了这篇文章了。
方法论
很多人听到方法论三个字，就觉得我要开始pua，说我阿里味，但是我觉得这个查问题的方式可能会对大家有点帮助。
很多人都会有这样的困扰，给你的一个工作内容是一个你完全陌生的东西，第一选择是逃避然后开始摆烂。我记得前一阵子和一个网友聊天，他有一次面试的时候也问了这样的问题。这次同步优化其实也相似的问题,是一个对我来说相对比较陌生的东西。
我就是想说下我们是如何来拆解这个问题的。首先需要一些对应相关的基础知识，我去官网查看了些对应的文档资料，仔细的了解了Gradle生命周期相关的，看看能不能对我们后续有所帮助，这个对于后续优化其实是非常重要的。

然后我通过我们的一个monitor插件，我看了大概一个礼拜的同步相关的编译日志，发现了一蛛丝马迹的。monitor就是一个通过BuildOperationNotificationListenerRegistrar把编译信息都记录到一个本地文件夹下的html中，然后把这些信息都发布都远端，方便后续排查问题。
这个monitor插件我在github上进行了一次kotlin翻译
问题大概如下:
遍历工程文件夹速度过慢，耗时大概1分钟左右
所有依赖全部切换成源码之后因为工程太多，所以展开速度过慢
Configuration之后竟然有个很慢的东西，占据了大量的耗时
这个就是我的方法论，通常碰到一个比较大的问题，我会把…</span>

Morbius is back in theaters — despite no one even asking for it — and its unpopularity is only making itself more obvious. The film made just $85,000 on Friday after making a return to over 1,000 theaters, bringing its domestic cumulative to $73.6 million (via Forbes). 
Morbius was originally released on April 1st and wasn’t the most well-received. In The Verge’s review of the flick, our TV and film reporter, Charles Pulliam-Moore, says Morbius’ pacing, plot, and the performance of its lead actors feel “ill-conceived,” and “calls into question Sony’s grand project of building an entire cinematic universe on Spider-Man’s back.”

Before the event kicked off properly, players were transported to what appeared to be a frosted-over space station, where they could kill time by using huge guns to clear away an array of asteroids that circled the station while listening to characters like Agent Jones and The Origin bicker over a loudspeaker. They were then given a mission: stop a powerful weapon that could wipe out all life on the island.
It turns out, that space station actually housed a giant mech...

Apple is reportedly teaming up with Hollywood directors to create video content for its upcoming augmented reality (AR) / virtual reality (VR) headset, according to a report from The New York Times. Sources familiar with the matter told the Times that Jon Favreau is just one of the directors involved — he’s reportedly tasked with delivering a mixed reality experience based on Prehistoric Planet, the dinosaur-filled Apple TV Plus series he produced.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like we’ll be able to immerse ourselves in a Jurassic Park-like landscape anytime soon. In line with an earlier report from Bloomberg, the NYT says Apple’s headset might not launch until 2023 due to issues with battery life and performance. That said, its...

Another alleged Google Pixel 7 prototype has surfaced, this time from a Reddit user who says they bought it on Facebook Marketplace. From appearances, it’s a Pixel 7 Pro, which Redditor AMC20_ says was listed as a Pixel 6 Pro without a box. It is not, in fact, a Pixel 6 Pro.
Google’s phones have a long history of unusual leaks, but even by Pixel standards, this is a strange one. It’s also the second time a prototype Pixel 7 Pro has surfaced in the last week. In case you missed episode one of this saga, someone listed a Pixel 7 prototype on eBay. As Android expert Mishaal Rahman pointed out, the photos seem to have been taken with another prototype unit — a Pixel 7 Pro, which can be seen in the reflection on the phone’s glossy back panel....

New York’s State Assembly passed the Warehouse Worker Protection Act (WWPA) on Friday, a bill that would require Amazon and other companies to disclose production quotas to workers, as first reported by CNBC. If New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) signs it into law, it would also prevent employees from having to meet quotas that require them to skip lunch or bathroom breaks.
Just like a similar bill passed in California last September, the WWPA states that employers will need to provide each warehouse worker with “a written description of each quota to which the employee is subject” when they’re hired (or within 30 days of the bill becoming law). It also bars employers from punishing workers for failing to meet quotas that weren’t...

Apple’s software is very good, generally speaking. Even as the company has spread its focus among more platforms than ever — macOS and iOS and iPadOS and tvOS and watchOS and whatever software Apple’s building for its maybe-possibly-coming-someday car and its almost-certainly-coming-soon AR / VR headset — those platforms have continued to be excellent. It’s been a while since we got an Apple Maps-style fiasco; the biggest mistakes Apple makes now are much more on the level of putting the Safari URL bar on the wrong part of the screen.
What all that success and maturity breeds, though, is a sense that Apple’s software is… finished — or at least very close. Over the last couple of years, the company’s software announcements at WWDC have...

Google is expanding its custom text stickers to Android users who use the US-English version of its Gboard keyboard. Previously, only Google Pixel users had access to the feature, which lets you create and send personalized stickers by typing in your own text and choosing a premade design.
In addition to expanding custom stickers, Google is also introducing over 1,600 new Pride Month and summer-themed mashups to Gboard’s Emoji Kitchen. You can use the feature by simply typing in an emoji (or two) into a message, and then seeing what kind of mashups you can translate into stickers. The result is fun, and sometimes unconventional emoji combinations, like a soccer ball made out of watermelon.

There have been lots of great deals this week despite Memorial Day having come and gone, some of which are still available to Walmart Plus subscribers through the weekend. But if you’re someone who cares more about smart home tech than the current highlights at Walmart, we’ve got an exclusive treat just for you.
Wellbots is offering Verge readers up to $80 off on select Google Nest devices until Sunday, June 19th. This includes two great options for video doorbells if you favor using Google Assistant in your smart home setup. The longstanding Google Nest Hello — now known as the Nest Doorbell (wired) — is $80 off when you use promo code VERGE80 at checkout, which drops the excellent wired doorbell to $149.

                              <span>Saturday morning, aerospace company Blue Origin is slated to conduct its fifth tourist flight, sending a crew of six to the edge of space and back out of West Texas. Once again, it’s a flight without any major celebrities on board, as the company transitions into making these quick jaunts to space relatively routine.
The flight, called NS-21, comes just two months after Blue Origin’s last tourist trip on March 31st. That mission sent up five paying customers and one company employee — the first time no big names flew. The Blue Origin employee was actually a last-minute replacement for comedian and actor Pete Davidson, who was originally slated to fly but had to drop out due to scheduling issues when the mission was delayed. Prior to that...

                              <span>开源固件基金会发布公开信要求英特尔开源 FSP

开源固件基金会发起一封给英特尔的公开信，呼吁英特尔开源其固件支持包（FSP）。FSP 二进制文件对英特尔系统的固件开放程度有很大的限制，也是在英特尔硬件上支持 Coreboot、LinuxBoot 和其他技术的一个限制因素。而行业对拥有开源固件的兴趣越来越大。开源固件有助于从解决安全问题到在系统的低层次上推动创新功能。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：开源固件是自由硬件、自由软件的一块重要基石，也是英特尔一直舍不得放开的部分，不过我觉得以英特尔的对开源开放的态度，应该比英伟达更容易接受社区倡议。




Zstd 压缩固件的支持提交到 Linux 5.19

多年来，一直有人提议在 Linux 内核的固件处理中增加对 Zstd 压缩的支持，取代现有的 XZ 压缩，以节省磁盘空间，同时提供快速的解压缩。但这些补丁从未进入主线，而最终随着 Linux 5.19 的推出，它将会到位。以 .zst 结尾的固件文件将由 Linux 内核的固件加载器进行解压。

老王点评：有时候不得不说，Linux 对于新技术的采纳太过于谨慎了。




Facebook 正在开发“隐私安全”广告产品

据称，Facebook 正在早期开发一个不依赖任何匿名用户个人信息的产品。Facebook 的工程师们称之为“基本广告”，它针对的是那些试图建立知名度和塑造产品认知的品牌广告商。该产品似乎与广告商使用 Facebook 的目标工具背道而驰。但是，既能提供规模，又能绕过 CCPA 和 GDPR 等数据法规的广告仍然会得到广告商的青睐。

                              <span>在本周为龙芯 CPU 架构支持进入 Linux 5.19 而进行的疯狂冲刺之后，Linus Torvalds 今天成功地将这个受 MIPS64 启发的中国架构代码合并到了 Linux 主线内核中。然而，由于一些代码尚未通过审查，虽然该 CPU 架构代码已经到位，但一些关键的驱动程序还没有到位，因此 Linux 5.19 还无法龙芯架构上启动。

如果你不太了解这件事的进展，我来补充介绍一下：龙芯架构（LoongArch） 是由龙芯公司开发的 CPU 架构，长期以来以其基于 MIPS64 的系统而为人所熟知。但是随着上游 MIPS64 架构已经实际消亡，龙芯公司开始开发他们自己的 ISA。龙芯架构自称受到了 MIPS64 和 RISC-V 的启发，但一些龙芯架构的内核代码实际上是重新使用或精密复制自现有的 MIPS 代码。

今年早些时候，龙芯架构被 添加到 GCC 12 中作为主要系统编译器。与其他 Arm 或 RISC-V 设计相比，目前这一代 龙芯 3A5000 CPU 的性能 在现今阶段并不太诱人。不过我们将拭目以待这个中国国产 CPU 架构在未来几年的发展情况。

正如本周早些时候所写的，有迫切的压力促使 龙芯架构进入 Linux 5.19，即使这意味着系统还无法启动。开发人员希望将 CPU 架构的代码主线化，这样他们就能腾出手来为 GNU C 库（Glibc）提交龙芯架构的支持代码。主线化他们的 Glibc 目标首先需要有一个坚实的用户空间 ABI 来解决内核支持。但由于 Glibc 2.38 预计在 8 月发布，龙芯架构需要合并到 Linux 5.19，以便有足够的时间在 7 月发布，才能使龙芯架构的代码赶得上 Glibc 的下一个版本截止线。

现在合并龙芯架构也减少了对 Linux 5.20 中可能出现的任何主线树范围变化的维护负担。

因此，大部分的龙芯架构代码已经出现在 Linux 5.19 中了，但缺少一些启动所需的 EFI 代码，IRQ 驱动与 Linux 的 MIPS 支持共享同一段代码，但由于情况复杂，还不能使用，PCI 部分的龙芯代码需要修改并通过 PCI 子系统区域进行合并。

龙芯架构的合并 对内核来说意味着增加了 21000 行的新代码，这还不包括尚未到达的所需驱动程序。据推测，到今年夏天晚些时候的 Linux 5.20 内核开发周期时，其余所需的驱动支持将会通过审查，从而产生一个可启动的龙芯架构系统。

就在四年前，著名的 Linux 内核开发者 Arnd Bergmann 预测 C-SKY 将是“我们最后一个添加到内核的新 CPU 架构”。C-SKY 是另一个中国架构，当时的想法是所有未来的 CPU 工作都将走向 RISC-V，但现在发现龙芯架构也许将是最后一个添加到 Linux 内核的新 CPU 架构。

                              <span>GNOME 开发人员在最近的一篇博文中提出了将 GNOME Shell 完全移植到手机上的想法。下面是我对这个项目的一些看法。


移动版 GNOME Shell

作为一个桌面环境，GNOME 在过去的十年中发展成为了 GNOME 40。GNOME 40 是一个重要的版本，它以一种现代的方式改变了完整的用户界面设计。

看着 GNOME 40 的设计方式，你可能会觉得 Shell 和它的底层技术已经为小屏幕做好了准备。手势驱动的工作区、图标网格和停靠区 —— 在某种程度上感觉更接近于像安卓这样的移动操作系统，而不是桌面环境。

此外，系统托盘、日历、通知和原生的应用程序，可以有效地在较小尺寸的设备上工作。得益于 GTK4 和 libadwaita，其设计是响应式的，应用程序和控件的外观与移动平台很匹配。

在 GNOME 40 之后，GNOME 开发者为较小尺寸的设备（如平板电脑和手机）设计了几个 GNOME Shell 的概念验证。

为什么是现在？

任何项目的开发和研究工作都要花费时间和金钱。虽然有来自主要科技公司对 GNOME 的捐赠，但这次有一个 “原型基金Prototype Fund” 帮助该团队继续进行这项努力。原型基金 是德国教育部（BMBF）支持公共利益软件的资助项目。

包括什么？

设计一个完整的移动用户界面，并将其与移动操作系统整合是一个非常复杂的项目。它需要一个精心设计的愿景来支持成千上万的移动硬件和用户支持。更不用说，用户在移动设备上的隐私和安全问题了。

因此，有了这个基金，团队可以集中精力进行概念验证，以满足 GNOME Shell 中一些基本的用户互动。


启动器

应用程序网格

轻扫、手势和导航

用手机键盘搜索

检测屏幕大小和支持屏幕旋转

工作空间和多任务

设置

屏幕键盘




始终要记住的是，移动体验远不止用户界面这么简单。另外，GNOME 本身并不是一个操作系统。它由底层的稳定的操作系统组成，它提供了非常需要的隐私和安全。另外，“应用商店”的概念也是如此。手机制造商需要与 GNOME 开发者合作，让他们的产品采用这个概念。

进展如何？

在写这篇文章时，团队给我们快速演示了取得的进展。在下面的视频中可以看到：




复杂的任务是识别触摸屏手机中的各种手势。例如，你可能会使用长触摸、短触摸、双指轻扫和拖动，以及许多只有在小尺寸设备中才可行的可能性。这需要在各自的 GNOME Shell 组件中推倒重构。

而完全在现有的 GNOME Shell 基础上开发它们是很有挑战性的工作。

此外，该团队使用著名的 Pinephone Pro 进行开发和测试。Pinephone 已经是一个商业产品，装有 “友商” KDE Plasma 手机和其他 Linux 操作系统。




结语

如果一切按计划进行，我们可能在一个完整的开源手机中获得原生的 GNOME 体验。而你可以重新拥有你的隐私!

另外，我不确定 Phosh（它也是基于 GNOME 的）会发生什么。虽然 Phosh 是由 Purism 开发和管理的，但看看 GNOME Shell 在移动设备上的努力和 PHosh 在未来一段日子的发展方向将是很有趣的。

那么，你对这个项目的前景怎么看？请在下面的评论栏里告诉我。

                              <span>本教程概述了 Collision 的功能和使用指南。它是一个基于 GUI 且易于使用的程序，可让你使用加密哈希函数验证文件。


为什么需要验证文件？

人们每天都通过互联网下载文件。但许多用户从不费心去验证他们的完整性或真实性。这意味着不知道该文件是否合法且未被任何恶意代码篡改。

以作为标准安装镜像的 Linux 发行版 的 ISO 文件为例。所有流行的发行版制造商在 ISO 文件还提供哈希文件。使用该文件，你可以轻松比较下载文件的哈希值。让你可以放心你的文件是正确的并且没有以任何方式损坏。

此外，如果你通过不稳定的互联网连接下载大文件，该文件可能会损坏。在这些情况下，它也有需要验证。

Collision – 功能和使用方法

Collision 使用加密哈希函数来帮助你验证文件。加密哈希函数是一种流行的算法，它通过多种加密算法将文件数据生成为固定长度的数据流。最受欢迎的是 MD5、SHA-1、SHA-256 和 SHA-512。所有这些 Collision 都支持。

除此之外，Collision 还提供了一个简洁的用户界面，它对每个 Linux 用户都简单易用。这是它的外观。



首先，它有两个主要特点。 a、上传文件以获取校验和和或哈希值；b、将校验和与上传的文件进行比较。

例如，如果你有一个简单的文件，你可以通过“打开文件Open a File”按钮上传一个文件，或“打开Open”按钮重新上传另一个文件。

如下图所示，该文本文件具有以下各种哈希函数的校验和。现在你可以通过互联网/与任何人共享该文件，以及用于验证的校验和值。



此外，如果有人篡改文件（即使是单个字节）或文件在分发过程中被破坏，那么哈希值就会完全改变。

其次，如果要验证已下载文件的完整性，请点击“验证Verify”选项卡。然后上传文件，输入你收到的上传文件的哈希值。

如果匹配，你应该会看到一个绿色勾号，显示其真实性。



此外，这是另一个示例，我修改了测试文件并保持大小相同。这个场景清楚地表明它对该文件无效。



重要说明

这里值得一提的是，哈希方法不会验证文件元属性，如修改时间、修改日期等。如果有人篡改了文件并将其还原为原始内容，这种哈希方式将其称为有效文件。

现在，让我们看一个验证 ISO 文件的典型示例。

使用 Collision 验证 Ubuntu Linux 的示例 ISO 文件

我相信你在使用 Linux 时通常会下载许多 ISO 文件。为了说明，我从官方 Ubuntu 下载页面下载了流行的 Ubuntu ISO 服务器镜像。



SHA256SUMS 文件带有上面的该安装程序的以下校验和值：



下载后，打开 Collision 应用并通过“验证Verify”选项卡上传 ISO 文件。然后复制 SHA-256 值并将其粘贴到左侧的校验和框中。

如果你已正确下载并按照步骤操作，你应该会看到该文件是真实有效的。



如何安装 Collision

使用 Flatpak 可以轻松安装 Collision 应用。你需要为你的 Linux 发行版 设置 Flatpak，并单击以下链接以安装 Collision。


通过 Flathub 安装 Collision


安装后，你应该通过发行版的应用菜单找到它。

有没有其他方法可以在没有任何应用的情况下验证文件？

是的，所有 Linux 发行版中都有一些内置程序，你还可以使用它们来使用终端验证文件及其完整性。

下面的终端程序可用于确定任何文件的哈希值。它们默认安装在所有发行版中，你甚至可以将它们用于你的 shell 脚本以实现自动化。

md5sum 


sha1sum 


sha256sum 


使用上述程序，你可以找出哈希值。但是你需要比较它们以手动验证。



结束语

我希望本指南可以帮助你使用 Collision GTK 应用验证你的文件。它使用起来很简单。此外，你可以在终端中使用命令行方法来验证您想要的任何文件。尽可能始终检查文件完整性总是应该的。

In this article, we will go through setting up a development workflow in the Windows terminal.
Know how to type
Windows 10/11 (Some things may not work for you in this article if you are on some other version)
(Optional) Know Basic Unix Commands such as cd, mkdir, etc
We will set up the following:
Powershell
Nerd Fonts
Theme
Scoop
z Directory Jumper
Terminal Icons
Node &amp; Git
Neovim
Oh-My-Posh
Autocomplete
Aliases
Utilities
Well, then, let&#x27;s get started!

                              <span>Hello Coders 👋
For past few weeks, I&#x27;ve been working on a web extension 🌎 for Chromium Base Browsers.
An extension that will allow you to talk to people over the internet, who are in the same website/webpage as you are in, assuming they&#x27;ve installed the app as well.
Can you imagine how exciting 🤩 this is. I felt the same when this idea stricken my mind.
With unlimited possibilities 🤩
Talk to people with similar interests
Talk to people before making any transaction on an eCommerce site.
So, just yesterday I&#x27;ve submitted it for the review, it may take up-to 3days or so to get live on Chrome web store.
So stay connected and subscribed, I&#x27;ll post an article once it goes live.
Thanks,
happy coding</span>

Deploy the machine and connect to the network 
OPENVPN (which I will be using) or via the built-in Attackbox.

Find the services exposed by the machine
nmap . We can see that they are running the following services: ssh, netbios, and microsoft-ds.

How many services are running under port 1000?
nmap -p1-1000 .


We can see that there are two services running: ftp and http.

What is running on the higher port?
nmap -sV .

We can see one port above 1000, which is port 2222/tcp and it is running ssh.

What&#x27;s the CVE you&#x27;re using against the application?

Okay, there&#x27;s not much for us there, so let&#x27;s see what other directories we can find to see which services we can exploit. Let&#x27;s run a gobuster scan to f…</span>

First things first. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) (or oh shi-) refers to the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources such as sources found over the internet to produce actionable intelligence on a subject. 
Okay, gone with you boring information. Let&#x27;s start hunting!
Before we begin with answering the questions, let&#x27;s download the task files which contains our image. Once you&#x27;ve loaded up your image, right click and open up its properties. When we go into the details, we can identfify the author of the image: OWoodflint.


Let&#x27;s see what we can find about our new friend OWoodflint by Googling them. We can see that OWoodflint has three profiles: Twitter, GitHub, and a personal blog.




Now that our basic hunting is over, let&#x27;s start answering questions!
What is this users avatar of?


What city is this person in?


Whats the SSID of the WAP he connected to?

To do this, we need to go over to Wigle.net. Register for an account, and once you&#x27;ve done that head over into view &gt; advanced search. Paste in the BSSID they tweeted and let the good times roll. 😎


What is his personal email address?
 

What site did you find his email address on?

What site did you find his email address on?


What is this persons password?

Congratulations! You are now a certified stalker(this is a joke, OSINT is very useful and unlike stalking, legal). I made you a certificate because you deserve it:

See you next time. Happy hacking! 😊

                              <span>Regarding accessibility, you&#x27;ll always hear the following sentence: Semantic HTML always wins.
Accordions are sections of content grouped by headers. The user can then collapse or close these sections to show/hide more information.

Regarding these accordions, this might be the one exception to the semantic HTML rule.
But, this is a bit controversial.
details &amp; summary elements, which is precisely this!
However, they didn&#x27;t have full support, so many people would argue that a custom setup is still the way to go.
As I write this, the browser support is still lacking on IE11, older Edge, and Opera mini.
Lacking, meaning they don&#x27;t support the toggle and will fall back to showing the whole content piece.
To set up the details &amp; summary setup, we can use the following markup.

  Introduction
  
The text inside this will be shown on click.
You can even add multiple lines in here.


The code snippet above will render a native toggle.

Then I tested the code on IE11, which is unsupported, and we got the following result.

We should use the semantic HTML as intended. If we show these elements as open to older browsers, that is the way it is.
They work perfectly fine on modern browsers and act as expected.
The cool part about using the semantics is that they evolve. They will get better and more advanced support.
As mentioned, the semantic elements support screen readers and other use-cases perfectly.
It also indexes nicely in the rotor from our screen reader.
And those using older technology get to see the entire content. And that&#x27;s perfectly fine.
Are you looking to try it out?
Use the following CodePen to see how it works.





  
  
  Bonus!


The old ways of creating accessible accordions always relied on introducing some JavaScript to handle states.
In this version, we can ship it with 0 JavaScript, which is another win for semantic HTML.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m Sam Zhang.
Recently I&#x27;ve updated my portfolio site. Originally I used LogTure as my portfolio and my blog, but I think it&#x27;s not &quot;cool&quot; enough.
So I started building a cooler one. After Googling around, I decided to make a terminal-like site similar to yasfu.net with Vue 3.
Vue 3 is still new to me though. I mainly work on React projects recently and didn&#x27;t explore the new features introduced in Vue 3. So this time I decided to give it a try. And after struggling with errors, I finally finished this project.
Demo: https://samzhangjy.com/
GitHub: https://github.com/samzhangjy/VueTerm
And of course, feel free to report issues to me!
However there&#x27;re some downsides about this project. One is that the current bash-like command system has some trouble handling complicated paths. So for example, when you type in cd ../folder/subfolder will cause an inner failure of cd.
Recursive might be a good way to solve this problem and I&#x27;ll try to implement it into this project in the near future.
And here is the end of the article. Feel free to play around with my project!</span>

It&#x27;s not a secret that maintaining an open source project is often thankless and time-consuming work. However, I&#x27;ve learned that there&#x27;s one shared joy among open source maintainers: They love building with a group of technologists who passionately believe in their vision.
Marketing feels cringey
Community support and teamwork are major incentives for open source maintainers. However, gaining community support and contributors is a challenge, especially as a new maintainer. The hope is that technologists will find our projects and start contributing by chance. The reality is we have to market our projects. Think about it: Develo…</span>

原文发表在 公众号：琚致远 中
API7.ai 是一家依托于开源项目的基础软件公司，我与它因开源软件 Apache APISIX 产生交集。更多内容请阅读我与 Apache 软件基金会的故事。
2020 年初，温铭 邀请我加入公司一起创业，我被「创业、开源、远程」三个关键词所深深吸引。此时，我在深圳另外一家公司任职 Web 工程师，尽管被新的机会所打动，但想到团队负责人 昕哥 对我非常好（ 2019 年初发放 Offer 后等待我半年之久、在 Web 工程中教会我许多技能）以及我希望做长线事情，因此 2 次婉拒了 温铭 的邀请。后来，院生 又约我聊了聊，由于自己内心对全职远程做开源项目无限向往，我最终决定加入创业之旅。
一切都需要从零开始，没有协作流程、团队规章、基础设施，有的只是成员之间时不时通过「支流科技启航啦」微信群沟通事情。

随后的几个月时间里，每隔一段时间微信群会多一名新成员，到 2020 年末我们有大概 10 名左右成员。
此外，我们每个月会从全国各地前往 珠海办公室 团聚（一周时间），大家中午、晚上一块儿吃饭聊一聊，促进彼此之间的感情。


同时，我们会不定期在深圳、上海、北京等地区举办 Apache APISIX 线下活动，将社区关注者们聚集一起进行分享、交流。




以及 Apache APISIX 在 2020 年从基金会完成孵化，成为 Apache 软件基金会顶级项目。

以上看上去都很美好，但团队内部磨合却并不顺畅：以远程协作效率低为主。
大部分成员在此之前是没有远程协作的经历的，在新鲜感过去后，长期在家工作会导致孤独甚至抑郁、无法忍受异步沟通延迟高、工作与生活混在一起难以协调等等，这一切副作用导致团队协作效率非常低。我个人自 2018 年开始长期远程协作，于我自然而然的事情，对于别的同学或许就是灾难了：TA 自己“痛苦”…</span>

这两天在面试，看了很多官方文档，发现到了最后跟没有读差不多。自己做的笔记呢，实际上就是从官网上吵了一些东西下来，感觉不到里面有多少自己总结的东西，纯属浪费时间了。
现在总觉得还不如看一下别人的博客，但是呢，跟在别人后面吃饭不长久，总有要自己面对的时候。

我们目前在做一些项目，人手不是很够，主要是用 React.js + Node ，希望有相关的工程经验。目前的几个同学也都比较聪明，工程能力也很 ok 。相信在团队内实习的同学在工程方面会有一定的提升。
团队非常小，主要也只是做一些小项目，做的东西也谈不上很酷，我们还是希望对代码质量有一定要求，希望代码质量可以过关，有算法经验很好，但是也不会考很难的面试题目。 
合同写的基本实习补贴会是 120 / 天，剩下的部分是绩效考评，根据能力最多能到 480 / 天, 预算上限是 600 / 天，但可能需要能力非常突出。面试门槛和难度不高，但如果工程上发现不满足要求我们也尽量在一周内说拜拜，不会浪费大家时间。
卑微的放一个邮箱： nexthiring@protonmail.com 没有做简历的同学也可以放 github 或者写三四行介绍，但希望可以让我们看到你的亮点。</span>

先介绍下网络环境：主路由是 ROS ，DHCP 也由 ROS 来分配，EXSi 的管理口也是通过 ROS 的 DHCP 获取的
EXSi 装了两个虚拟机，分别是 OpenWrt 和爱快
爱快和 OpenWrt 都是作为旁路由，均不分配 DHCP
爱快虽然作为旁路由，但是也单独进行了拨号（直通了一个网口给爱快作为 WAN 口，这个口直接从光猫接线）
现在遇到的问题是，Windows PC 中的一台虚拟机将网关设置成爱快，流量却是从 OpenWrt 出去的，不理解；因为 OpenWrt 的 IP 并没有设置到任何地方</span>

一、缘由
“如何提问”的文章很多，这里想谈一下“如何解答”这个问题。之所以写这篇文章内，源于我的两个提问：
提问 1：求助，执行字节码指令时栈的具体变化是怎么样的？
提问 2：  Python array 文档里面的 machine values 具体指的是什么？
看完提问 1 的解答，我感觉心情舒畅；看完提问 2 的解答，我感觉整个人心情都不好了。
所以想借此谈谈一些个人观点，希望下次回答我的问题的大佬能先看下这篇文章。当然了，你我若无任何交集，那看不看这篇文章都无所谓。同时也是为了营造一个更好的中文提问与解答社区。
二、tips
下面具体谈谈“如何回答”。
2.1 可以解决的问题
如果知道怎么解决，那么直接提供解决方案，并尽可能提供参考资料。
例如提问 1 里面的解答：
6, 10 画错了。
两个都是要先出栈两次。只是 10 的 TOS1 如果支持 inplace ，等同于出栈一次。

这类解答是最让人感到舒服的 ，直接指出问题，并提供解决方案。如果再提供一些参考资料，那么可以说相当令人满意。
2.2 不可以解决的问题
对于无法解决的问题，那么最好提供具体的建议。
例如提问 1 里面的解答：
我自己画出来的也不对，不过能确定你地址 6 、10 的地方画错了，6 的那里要出栈两个再写入（ Binary operations remove the top of the stack (TOS) and the second top-most stack item (TOS1) from the stack. They perform the operation, and put the result back on the stack.），10 是 inplace 的操作，你 append 了。咱俩可以讨论一下

这类解答可以看出解答者也是真的去验证了。
三、不好的解答
看下提问 2 里面的解答：
建议学一下 C 语言 /剩下的你该去学 C 语言了 / 所以楼上让你学 C 语言还真说对了

合着你知道”machine value“不是一个常见的用法？这本来就不算是一个专业术语，我们帮你推测验证它的具体含义，然后你说没有给出定义？要饭要的这么理直气壮的吗？

“计算机科学与技术”专业毕业的人不知道内存表示和补码不是一码事？不会 C 语言？ CSAPP 没看过？毕业挺好，下次不要毕业了。

我看合着大家回答没啥问题啊，但是整个就一网络喷子的作风，其实我还是比较赞同你说的 machine value 为内存表示了，不同机器 /大小端，不同平台表示也可能不同。

看到三个大佬“建议学 C 语言”之类的回答，我不能说有错，我只能说：私以为这样的回答和不回答貌似也没有多大差别。以及所谓的“要饭的”，“网络喷子”之类的回答就让人感到莫名其妙。
对于提问 2 里面的谁对谁错的问题，本帖无意再讨论，里面很多人的回答都是“前面的人回答没有问题”——如果你也要来重复这句话，那么就没有必要了，因为你偏离了解答问题的初衷——解答问题的最终目的是为了让提问者明白，而不是解答者之间互相认同。
三、总结
之所以写这边文章，只是希望下次回答我的问题的大佬能先看下这篇文章，我不希望看到像提问 2 里面那样的回答。当然了，你我若无任何交集，那看不看这篇文章都无所谓。
同时也是为了营造一个更好的中文提问与解答社区。</span>

我估摸着如果发布会发了新品就退换更合适的。但是，今天突然送到了。
出于激动，我还拆开来看了下，14 寸 10 核 16G 内存 1T 硬盘的 mbp 。
有一点点重，但是看起来倒是挺小巧的。观感还行，可是明天就是发布会了啊，明天应该不会有 M2 的 mbp 吧？有点害怕。
大家有什么想法么？</span>

团队与项目
我们是一支远程技术团队，组建于 2015 年，在浙江嘉兴（上海、杭州、苏州附近的一个小城市，Dang 的诞生地南湖）。前几年主要从事软件外包，现在已经不做了，也尝试过几次产品探索，并没有成功。2019 年 11 月起开始做电商供应链项目（可搜索微信小程序：闯货），我们作为技术团队参与其中。

简单介绍闯货，闯货是一个基于微信端的电商平台，追求产品品质与服务，希望让买卖变得更简单，没有繁琐的营销套路。到目前为止我们也没有主流营销工具，如优惠券、折扣、满减，双 11 ，618 等。现有的抢购秒杀、预售是因为供货不足，并非饥饿营销，所以系统并没有单独的抢购秒杀、预售功能，所有商品都可能成为抢购秒杀、预售。
闯货运营团队目前有 200 多人，大部分都是 80 、90 、00 ，连接了产品从工厂、物流、选品评测、售前售后到用户的整条链路。想要了解闯货团队更多信息，可查看公众号 [拾个点] 的部分文章，或抖音、小红书搜索“闯货”。技术团队目前 4 人，1 产品经理、1 前端、1 后端、1 全栈，都是 80 后，一起协作 4 年以上。

                              <span>jin7: 朋友买的联想小新，用了两年就坏了，到官方维修点修理，换主板+一年保修，1601 元，还没付钱。
现在被告知，主板换了，但电脑键盘有三个按键失灵了，但暂时不能帮我们修了，因为他怕上面的人发现，会影响他，要一个月后再去修。

很奇怪，换个主板还能把键盘搞坏。
一次没修好，修坏了，还不能继续接着修。

电脑还没去拿，准备先电话沟通。</span>

If you have the Snapdragon model, you are out of luck as its locked bootloader means you cannot install any custom ROM on it.

最近 Mac 拿去修了，用 iPad 工作了一天，因为在外访问 NAS 不方便，所以调取工作资料时有点难受。
方案：把工作文件全部存储在 iCloud 里，这样 Mac 、iPhone 和 iPad 可以随时访问和同步。Time Machine 每周备份一次以防 iCloud 抽风丢文件。
问题 1: 希望有把 iCloud 当作自己工作的主力存储和同步盘的 V 友从稳定性和安全性方面分享一下心得？
问题 2: 如果有文件分享的需求（主要是类似 dropbox 这样一下丢个 1G 左右的文件链接国外能稳定访问得到），这样是否美区 iCloud 比国区更加适合我？
谢谢，祝各位端午安康，假期愉快。</span>

v6 网关是内网网关地址。
改成桥接测试，用爱快 v6 测试，有前缀，路由本身也得到了地址。有状态或者无状态均能分配 v6 到内网。
无论怎么接入，路由追踪除了第一跳后面就没有通的了。
直接测试 v6 地址也不通。
用普联 gp110 这种纯桥接光猫测试结果一样。只有地址分配，网关是个内网地址。到不了外网。电脑直接拨号也试过了。

go 语言中都是可以并行的协程，我们为了简单下面统一称为线程安全。
slice 和 map 都是线程不安全的，我知道 sync.map 是安全的，但是一是操作不方便比如下面这一段
a :&#x3D; sync.Map{}
a.Store(&quot;1&quot;, 1)

就得用 store 方法才能存储，而普通 map 可以直接 map[&quot;key&quot;]操作，这个小问题还可以勉强接受。
最关键的问题是只提供了线程安全的 sync.map 这种，没有提供线程安全的 slice ，如果要自己一个一个加锁或者用 channel 控制非常麻烦。请问有没有别人实现好的线程安全的 slice 或者线程安全的全部数据结构 ？
我在 github 上搜全都是别人实现的线程安全的 map 或者 queue 或者 set ，而且风格非常不统一，求有哪位大神实现了线程安全的 slice,map,queue,stack 等常见数据结构，这样风格能统一，并且还能线程安全，谢谢各位。
我实在技术不太行，我写的话经常有并发问题，所以才来求这种线程安全的基础数据结构，我知如果用了这种线程安全的基础数据结构会导致性能下降，没关系，我的系统对性能要求没那么高。我要是有能力一个人实现上面这些，我就早全一个风格实现不来麻烦大家了。希望有大神能帮帮我，万分感谢。</span>

但是前阵子好像取消了，那个公告也找不到了。我试了下，确实不会提示空间已满了。但是仅仅快速上传了一会，速度就骤降，我看了下，500Mb 宽带，原来 20-30MB/s 的上传速度，现在只有 10kb/s 不到，一天大概能上传个 200-300MB 。
我算了下，按这个速度，我备份 1T 文件要 11.5 年。
这也太慢了吧，是只有我这么慢吗？还是大家都这么慢？这个会恢复吗？比如过上一个星期？</span>

但是想接触点复杂的电商业务在简历上好写一些，其实他们做的项目的 git 权限我都有，感觉也就是 crud ，而且代码质量一言难尽，但是 redis ，mq 这些中间件结合业务用的比较多，我这屎山就很少用到这些。业务的话，要是捋代码的话感觉业务也能捋个差不多吧，我再编上点复杂的技术场景写简历上感觉也还行。

我的问题是，是和领导聊一下，让我整点别的，不光扒屎山；还是继续抱紧屎山，利用较多的空闲时间努力学习，到时候写简历就写他们的项目，屎山就不写了。</span>

我之前的路由器用了 2 年，最近感觉上网有点迟滞，所以研究了一番当前路由器的指标，对于 100 平米，4-5 个房间的家庭环境，选择路由器有 如下挑选标准
标准
要支持 wifi6 ，这是 IEEE 802.11.ax 标准，传输速度更大，达到 9.6Gbps
支持 2 路以上 MIMO ，一个设备就占两路，如果只支持 2 路，无法并行
内存足够大，现在家庭中需要联网的设备越来越多，除了手机，pad ，pc ，什么空调，冰箱，灯都要联网
mesh 组网，可有可无，如果是别墅或者 loft ，还是需要，这些就是整合了以前的 AP 功能
满足以上要求的路由器门槛就是 AX5400，更高级别其实是浪费了
AX5400 可选品牌
TP-LINK AX5400
Redmi 路由器 AX5400
这两个配置基本一样，价格都是 349 ，红米的内存是 512M ，TP 的内存才 256M
TP AX5400 平台的 5480 据说最好，但是价格高达 659 ，因为多了一个 2.5G 的 wan/lan 端口，家庭宽带大部分都是 100M-300M ，2.5G 也是浪费
最后买了 Redmi ，用了一周，目前感觉是穿墙效果比较好，其他没有明细感知。
补充
100 米内 超 5 类网线的传输性能足够了，超 6 类和它没有明显区别，网线上印有  cat.5E  就是超 5 类</span>

腾讯云主机套百度云加速企业版 CNAME 接入
ubuntu-docker 镜像
traefik 反代其它容器内的应用
采用 dns 验证
traefik 用的是 lego 这个 acme 工具从 letsencrypt 获取证书,验证时报错:
SERVFAIL looking up CAA for example.com - the domain&#x27;s nameservers may be malfunctioning
即使给 DNS 添上 CAA 记录依然报错
根据报错找到 2021 年一篇文章:
https://jamesqi.com/%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2/%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99%E6%8E%A5%E5%85%A5%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E4%BA%91%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E5%90%8E%E5%87%BA%E7%8E%B0%E7%9A%84SSL%E8%AF%81%E4%B9%A6%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98
发现是百度云的问题, 参考它的方案用 CF 关 proxy 做纯 DNS 并添加 CAA 记录, 百度做子域名 CNAME 加速.
此时 CAA 报错解决, 可正确获取证书.
用百度云的 API 将获取的证书上传, 问题解决.
但是麻烦的地方在于为了使用百度云加速, 每新增个子域名都得去 cf 上加 CNAME 解析, 并修改上传证书的脚本.
全自动更新泛域名证书一劳永逸省事的优点荡然无存. 
国内还有什么其它靠谱的支持证书自动续期的云加速服务吗? 下一次试试别家的.</span>

楼主最开始用的是 shadowsocksX-NG ，后来由于增加了 vmess 的服务器就换成了大名鼎鼎的 clashX ；接着，看了 V2EX 上的一些帖子换成了据说更好用的 clashX PRO ，同样是免费的，但是我发现 PRO 不是开源的就换回 clashX 了
最近高强度网上冲浪发现很多问题，不知道是和 mac 有关还是 clashX 自身的问题，包括 pppoe 拨号上网时切换“设置系统代理”会失效（重启恢复）、同一个服务器在 clashX 中无法连接但是用 shadowsocksX-NG 和手机上的 shadowrocket 都能连接
目前有点迷茫，大家都用的哪款呢（这个是可以讨论的吗，不可以的话麻烦 mod 删帖🙏🏻）</span>

我用 pass otp 管理 otp 验证。
所以我下了一个 alfred workflow:https://github.com/CGenie/alfred-pass 用来快速得选择 otp 并输出到剪切板。
其实这个 shell 很简单，就是在 alfred 选择 otp 后，执行
bash pass-otp.sh &quot;{query}&quot;

而 psss-otp.sh 里则是用 pass otp 工具的命令来输出 otp 到剪切板
pass otp -c &quot;$1&quot;

但是遇到一个很诡异的事，就是我单独去终端模拟器执行输出 Steam 的 otp 时，能正常输出到剪切板
bash pass-otp.sh Steampass 文件名


但是用 alfred 时就毫无反应（也不能说没反应，gpg 的私钥密码输入框至少是弹出来了）

但是，换另一个 otp ，比如 coinbase 。用 alfred 时就能正常输出到剪切板。

我研究了一晚上，包括脚本里加上打印看传参有没有问题，有没有特殊字符，可是都很正常，心态都给我整崩了。
来求助下 V 站的大家，看看还有什么细节没考虑到的。
T_T 存 otp 链接的 pass 文件名的格式我都是保持一致的，唯一的区别就是 Steam 的 otp 是 5 位的，但是手动执行脚本又能取到，真的是百思不得其解！！！如果是脚本原因的话，试验其他的 otp 文件又都正常！！！
这里附一下 psss-otp.sh 的内容
#!/bin/bash

set -e

QUERY&#x3D;$1
PATH&#x3D;/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# GPG agent
# envfile&#x3D;&quot;$HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.env&quot;
# if [[ -e &quot;$envfile&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; kill -0 $(grep GPG_AGENT_INFO &quot;$envfile&quot; | cut -d: -f 2) 2&gt;/dev/null; then
#     eval &quot;$(cat &quot;$envfile&quot;); export GPG_AGENT_INFO&quot;
# else
#     eval &quot;$(gpg-agent --daemon --write-env-file &quot;$envfile&quot;)&quot;
# fi

# PASS
#pass otp &quot;$QUERY&quot; | awk &#x27;BEGIN{ORS&#x3D;&quot;&quot;} {print; exit}&#x27; | pbcopy

非专业前端，项目性质是公司有个小型运维业务需要一个前端页面，基本由我负责，也不是很受重视，具体操作上自由度很大。
现在很纠结要不要上 vue3 ，个人情况是前端很多东西都不懂，但 vue2 用的还算顺手，因为本身大多数业务也没有那么极限的业务复杂度，也不追求极限效率。js 本身是东西比较少的语言，凑合也就写了。这几天花了一些时间了解了一下 vue3 + ts ，感觉不使用高级特性的话写起来倒也没有和原来有太大改变，是我可以接受的范围。ts 方面感觉个人用起来也只会当个类型注释来用，不会涉及太复杂的特性。
但是因为前端知识不足，对不了解的领域选技术很纠结。简单分析了一下，感觉选 vue3 的好处就是带薪学习新技术，坏处则是不像 vue2 ，我有完全的把握能把业务做好，vue3 我对这方面没有信心，贸然选择一个全心的领域谁知道会给自己带来什么坑，尤其在涉及到第三方包引用方面。。在网上看到别人做的好看的好用的功能 /组件能不能顺利导入项目里真的完全没信心。
所以很纠结，因为重构本身是希望把代码梳理的非常清楚，业务整合，最大程度上简化运维工作的。如果用 vue3 的话会不会到最后技术上也没学到啥，只用了很皮毛的东西，但同时又给项目结构加入很多没必要的冗余，重构也没有把代码梳理得很好，给以后运维留下大坑之类的。v 友们有没有给点意见的</span>

刚开始买东西都是在淘宝，感觉京东很多余。
后来买东西喜欢在京东，淘宝商品描述没什么好看的，销量评论基本都是假的，描述什么没什么，跟 p 图照一样；感觉京东的使用体验比较一致，京东物流甚至能送货上门，其他连顺丰都放快递点自取，有时就奔着这点去京东买。
再后面喜欢先去米家看看，如果有就省下挑选的心智开销。

关于创意：
2018 年就有的创意，为什么就说是自己的创意呢？
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LlLxoPp5WY9q2bTZq5FDEw
关于代码：
你的代码：
https://github.com/Mr-xiaobing/OpenposePlayGame
我朋友写的代码：
https://github.com/zihan987/pose-game-python
https://github.com/zihan987/pose-game-js
你自己的代码是 OpenPose 的，不是 MediaPipe 的，我用的才是 MediaPipe 能不能看看代码？
想吃瓜的，可以对比看一看，代码一样吗？
完全就不是一个东西！
关于动作&amp;角色：
请问，这些人物还有别的动作吗？不都是统一的动作吗？小学生都知道，发气功波要用手，难道我要用脚吗？
还有你说的角色一样，现有角色，有 js 游戏现成代码的，就是这个角色，我直接在现成的代码上开发不行吗？
https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40986713/article/details/107590590
关于话术：
你说的灵机一动，我的原话是：找着找着，我“秃然”灵机一动，要不干脆自己动手写一个吧。
这个代码是我们自己写的，有毛病吗？
在之前的一期视频中：
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16L411A7n2
7:05 我提到过你，因为当时的内容用了你的视频画面，所以我提了。
但是，在新的一期视频中，代码代码不一样，视频视频不一样，为什么我还非得要再提你？
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1F3411G7Pt
不理解你的喷点在哪里？是因为你做过的东西，别人就不能做吗？只要做就是创意抄袭？
还有你说的，你的评论没有活过 1 分钟，你上来评论阴阳怪气，然后拉黑我一气呵成，难道我留着你过年吗？
多个帐号跟你沟通，你还拉黑？
退一万步讲，你想让我提你，也可以，但一上来评论区阴阳怪气，拉黑，拒绝沟通等一系列操作。
你说，我能怎么办？
你不是做这个项目的第一个人，我也不是最后一个人。</span>

ssh 连接远程的终端有时断掉后不会返回到本地 shell ，会卡着动不了，这时按 ctrl+q 就好了
有时终端会莫名光标丢失，这时执行 reset 就可以恢复了，这个命令估计还可以在提示符错乱（修改 PS1 大概率会）时执行，不过我还没遇到

本人对 MVVM 不熟，看了资料只知道概念并没有透彻的理解。
按我之前学习的理解，一个 ObservableObject 是一个 ViewModel，发布订阅的是 State（网上讲的都是这种），但是当 State 里面的数据也需要双向绑定的时候（传给子 View），发布订阅就变成了另外的 ViewModel，这里面是不是有啥问题。比如下面 MainViewModel，我是不是应该发布的是 users 而不是 userViewModels
class MainViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var userViewModels: [UserViewModel] &#x3D; []
}

class UserViewModel: Identifiable, ObservableObject {
    @Published var name &#x3D; &quot;&quot;
    let id &#x3D; UUID()

现在有两个纠结的点
1.尺寸上 14 ，16 。价格差不大，体验上 14 多出便携，16 有大屏幕，看评测 16 的外放和散热都会好点。问题是日常在家里必定外接屏幕和音响，但差价不大的情况下不上 16 又感觉有点不划算。
2.平时主要是 adobe 全家桶+Parallels （ autodesk 几款软件）+xcode 。内存不确定 16 够不够用，担心用段时间后后悔没上 32 ，但是看评测 16 和 32 在实际体验上差距不是很大，纠结。
有没有什么我忽略的地方？或者实际用下来体感有极大差别的地方。

城通网盘、蓝奏云、77file 、雪球云盘这些，每次点击“下载”都是弹出一个 php 下载页面。

用抓包抓了一下好像是 application/octet-stream 。每次都是浏览器下载器下载，怎么转到其他下载器下载？
比如这个：(文件不存在 只是一个例子)

经典等了 60 秒之后，点击“普通免费下载”

最近几个月，mac 会时不时的发出一种类似某个 APP 通知 /刷新的声音，声音有点像波浪声，就偶尔突然响一下（不是 QQ 的那个，QQ 的已经关了）
但是这个声音出来是随机的，手动排查不出来是哪个 APP ，活动监视器一个一个看也排查不出来。
有没有一个软件，或者脚本，能够持续监控系统声音输出，并记录是哪个 app 发出来的？
貌似只有这样我才能逮到是哪个软件发出来的声音。。。因为毫无规律的出现！</span>

视频文件共有 24 个：
[VCB-Studio] Zetsuen no Tempest [01][Ma10p_1080p][x265_flac_aac].mkv
[VCB-Studio] Zetsuen no Tempest [02][Ma10p_1080p][x265_flac_aac].mkv
[VCB-Studio] Zetsuen no Tempest [03][Ma10p_1080p][x265_flac_aac].mkv
...
[VCB-Studio] Zetsuen no Tempest [24][Ma10p_1080p][x265_flac_aac].mkv
字幕文件共有 24 个，比如绝园的暴风雨 03.ass
要将 绝园的暴风雨 03.ass 重命名为 
[VCB-Studio] Zetsuen no Tempest [03][Ma10p_1080p][x265_flac_aac].mkv
我想到将字幕的集数 03 截取出来，然后再重命名即可
代码如下：
for file in *; do echo ${file:0-6:2}; done
${file:0-6:2}# “绝园的暴风雨 03.ass”从右边数第六个字符开始，截取 2 个字符，所以是 03
最后加上重命名，大功告成
for file in *; do mv $file &quot;[VCB-Studio] Zetsuen no Tempest [${file:0-6:2}][Ma10p_1080p][x265_flac_aac].ass&quot;; done</span>

主号目前绑定了大量的付费会员服务及各类账号，目前凡是跟这个 QQ 关联的服务都登陆不了。
之前的骚操作：
以诈骗为名封禁 QQ 账号（确定为误封）：

以诈骗为名封禁微信账号（确定为误封）：

看来腾讯是不拿到我的人脸视频+手持身份证照片是绝不罢休了。

我有两台 mbp ，2016 和 2019 ，都插了电源，合盖！

所有设备电源线都插在同一个插线板（包括显示器，键盘鼠标充电线等等）。插线板插在一个小米蓝牙插座上（带功率统计）

2016 用的很少（合盖，没有任何外接设备，除了电源线插着）。2019 是每天的工作机，外接显示器，蓝牙键盘和鼠标。上班就是开显示器，动一下鼠标，显示器亮，开始工作。

下班后就直接关显示器！

但是，我发现，mbp 的实时功率显示，一直就是 20+w ，这也太高了吧……而且不是刚下班时，到晚上 10 点，12 点也差不多这个数值左右

Square announced on Thursday that it will begin to support Apple’s Tap to Pay technology later this year with a beta test arriving this summer as part of the company’s Early Access Program. 
Right now if a company is using Square to process sales it needs to use Square’s familiar dongle to receive payments. With support for Apple’s Tap to Pay it should be able to process a big chunk of payments with nothing but an iPhone and the Square app. The new program will allow iPhone users to pay with their phone within Square’s point of sale (POS) app. 
Apple first announced Tap to Pay in February 2022, and first supported Square’s competitor Stripe. The partnership with Stripe also supports payments made in the Shopify POS app. The Tap to Pay...

LG is catching up with Samsung in “lifestyle” TV land, adding a new model to its LG OLED Objet Collection that launched last year. The new Posé is a slimline take on Samsung’s Serif; it comes in 42-inch, 48-inch, and 55-inch screen sizes and launches in the third quarter of 2022, starting in Europe. 
The Posé joins the 65-inch Easel that was announced at CES (then called the Objet), which is designed to look like an art easel and has a sliding fabric cover to conceal the screen. Both can display artwork or photos when not in use.
But what is a lifestyle TV? Why is there a premium for a TV to look good in our homes? “Looks nice when in the middle of my living room” seems like a key consideration when buying a TV just as it is when you buy...

And, I mean, there’s always too much Elon news. But what’s happening right now feels worth digging into more deeply. So, let’s get into it.
On Tuesday, Musk demanded Tesla employees come back to the office or “pretend to work somewhere else,” which is an odd thing to say for a guy who splits his time between cities and at least four different companies. He’s also looking to cut about 10 percent of Tesla’s workforce, Reuters reported this morning, based on his “super bad feeling” about the economy, and all I’m saying is I don’t want to do layoffs, so I’m going to make you miserable enough to quit would...

Yesterday, Sony and Square Enix blessed us with the biggest chunk of Final Fantasy XVI news yet during the State of Play event. Square Enix released not only a new trailer but also a new blog and updates to the official Final Fantasy XVI website that has established a nice foundation upon which we can start building an idea of what this game is about and what we can expect. 
Despite the number, Final Fantasy XVI is not the 16th entry in the series; it’s not even the 16th single-player mainline entry, either (thanks to FFXIII’s sequels and the FFVII Remake). There are a million and a half Final Fantasy games, far too many to count. This is simply the one that comes after the one with Noctis and his bro-dtrip.

According to the US carriers, 5G has well and truly arrived. We did it! We won the race to 5G. But there’s one piece of the puzzle that’s still largely missing: voice. Phone calls still mainly rely on LTE networks, even where 5G data coverage is robust. Today, T-Mobile announced that it has taken a small step forward in making voice over 5G a reality. In Portland, Oregon, and Salt Lake City, Utah, some commercial calls will be routed via T-Mobile’s standalone 5G network.
Voice over 5G (referred to as Voice over New Radio, or VoNR) is a major challenge for the whole wireless industry, though all US carriers will likely want to move voice calling over to 5G sometime in the future to free up LTE spectrum for 5G. Voice calls over 5G are also...

In a blog post on Thursday, Meta said that it’s globally rolling out new creator tools for its TikTok competitor, Reels, on both Instagram and Facebook. The handful of new tools will make it easier for creators to skip using TikTok to edit short clips and help encourage people to create original content using Reels, which is something the team at Instagram really wants to happen. 
Instagram Reels will now let users import their own audio (that’s at least five seconds long) from their camera roll to their reel video. Reels also now supports 90-second videos, and it is adding interactive “stickers” that support polls, quizzes, and emoji — much like Instagram Stories. Instagram is also widely releasing templates that let users easily...

Google is telling users of the Android Auto for Phone Screens app that it’ll no longer work soon via an in-app pop-up message (via 9to5Google). The app enables a simplified in-car interface of Android that is safer to use while mounting the phone on a car dashboard, a great feature for those who don’t own newer cars with the version of Android Auto that runs on the infotainment screen.
This is actually not Google’s first warning that it was putting Android Auto for Phone Screens in exile. It was already deprecated last year when the company disabled Android Auto for Phone Screens on newer Android 12 devices. People with older devices could still access the app, but Google didn’t give a timeline on how long it would last, stating it has...

The New York state legislature has passed the United States’ first “right to repair” bill covering electronics. Called the Fair Repair Act, the measure would require all manufacturers who sell “digital electronic products” within state borders to make tools, parts, and instructions for repair available to both consumers and independent shops.
Having passed the legislature, it is awaiting signature by Governor Kathy Hochul, who is expected to support the measure. The measure will take effect one year after it passes into law.
“One giant leap for repairkind”
Self-repair groups like iFixit have applauded the ruling, calling it “one giant leap for repairkind” in a blog post following the announcement.

The Bitcoin mining boom in New York state hit a roadblock as the State Senate passed a bill that will halt new permits for certain fossil fuel power plants to be used in Bitcoin mining. The measure, which also initiates a study on the environmental impact mining facilities are having in the state, passed in the State Assembly earlier this year.  
Promising new jobs, the crypto industry had split Senate Democrats on whether the moratorium would come with greater environmental or economic costs. Talks languished until late in the evening as the State Senate neared its legislative deadline.

                              <span>大新闻！老式 iPad 可能很快就能运行 Linux

爱好者们成功地在一台旧的 iPad Air 2 上启动了 Linux 内核 5.18，这对一台设计上从未运行过苹果以外的任何操作系统的设备来说，是一个重大的壮举。目前，开发者们只在一些使用 A7 和 A8 芯片的旧版 iPad 硬件上运行了 Linux，这包括 iPad Air、iPad Air 2 和几代 iPad mini。但随后他们暗示，将有可能让 Linux 在任何装有 A7 或 A8 的设备上运行，也就是说还包括 iPhone 5S 和最初的 HomePod 等设备。不过，目前开发工作仍处于早期阶段，只能进行基本的启动，连文件系统都不能挂载。

老王点评：这真是一个突破，可以让那些老旧得无法升级、没有支持的 iPad、iPhone 变成有趣的设备。




Firefox 推出一个本地运行的机器翻译插件

这个“Firefox 翻译”插件是一个能在本地运行的机器翻译工具，即翻译引擎、语言模型和页面内翻译算法都完全在用户计算机内运行，没有任何数据会发送到云端，因此完全保密。第一次翻译一种语言时，它需要下载一些支持性资源，以及改进的语言模型，但实际的翻译工作是在用户自己的电脑上执行基于机器学习的过程。


消息来源：Mozilla



老王点评：这个插件目前支持的语言并不多，由于是欧盟资助的项目，目前还不支持中文的翻译，也没看到支持中文的计划。




谷歌为开源项目推出新的芯片设计网站

谷歌一直在帮助小型开源项目进行芯片制造，谷歌承担费用，并与 SkyWater 合作，使用其开源的工艺设计套件来设计。谷歌今天宣布了一个新的芯片设计门户网站，其 MPW 穿梭计划允许任何人提交开源集成电路设计，并在利用这个开源的工艺设计套件和其他开源 EDA 工具的同时，免费制造这些芯片。而所采用的 130 纳米的芯片技术也被证明对类似物联网的硬件原型设计仍然有用。


消息来源：phoronix



老王点评：这才真是真正支持开源硬件，不知道国内什么时候能有这样的支持。

                              <span>Linux Lite 6.0 是一个有趣的版本，有一个新的默认浏览器，改进了无障碍性、新的主题、新的系统监视器等等改进。




Linux Lite，是 最好的类 Windows 发行版 之一，刚刚发布了它的最新版本 6.0。

Linux Lite 6.0 基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，内置了 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。

这次升级包含了相当多的令人兴奋的新功能，包括一个新的窗口主题和无障碍技术。

让我们深入了解一下新的内容！

Linux Lite 6.0 概述

Linux Lite 6.0 包括许多变化，包括：


更新了软件

新的窗口主题

新的屏幕键盘

屏幕阅读器

屏幕放大镜

Chrome 取代 Firefox 成为默认浏览器

新的 GRUB 菜单


无障碍性的改进



Linux Lite 通过这一改变已经步入了大联盟。无障碍性，在历史上一直是 GNOME 特有的优势，它现在有了很大的改进。这主要体现在三个不同的工具上：一个屏幕键盘，一个屏幕阅读器（Orca），和一个屏幕放大镜。

屏幕键盘对于许多触摸屏用户和没有键盘的用户来说是相当有用的。另一方面，屏幕阅读器对于视障用户来说将是完美的。



最后一项无障碍改进屏幕放大镜，也是针对与屏幕阅读器相同的受众。然而，它与传统的桌面理念相当吻合，所以众多用户可能更青睐它，而不是屏幕阅读器。

这些无障碍性的改进有助于 Linux Lite 6.0 成为一个主流的选择。

更新的软件

与几乎所有的发行版升级一样，Linux Lite 6.0 包括更新的软件。最值得注意的是最新的 LibreOffice 稳定版 7.2.6。

其他更新包括 VLC 3.0.16、Thunderbird 91.7、Chrome 100、GIMP…</span>

                              <span>编程语言往往具有许多共同特征。学习一门新语言的好方法是去写一个熟悉的程序。在本文中，我将会使用 Awk 编写一个“猜数字”程序来展示熟悉的概念。




当你学习一门新的编程语言时，最好把重点放在大多数编程语言都有的共同点上:


变量 —— 存储信息的地方

表达式 —— 计算的方法

语句 —— 在程序中表示状态变化的方法


这些概念是大多是编程语言的基础。

一旦你理解了这些概念，你就可以开始把其他的弄清楚。例如，大多数语言都有由其设计所支持的“处理方式”，这些方式在不同语言之间可能有很大的不同。这些方法包括模块化（将相关功能分组在一起）、声明式与命令式、面向对象、低级与高级语法特性等等。许多程序员比较熟悉的是编程“仪式”，即，在处理问题之前设置场景所需花费的工作。据说 Java 编程语言有一个源于其设计的重要仪式要求，就是所有代码都在一个类中定义。

但从根本上讲，编程语言通常有相似之处。一旦你掌握了一种编程语言，就可以从学习另一种语言的基本知识开始，品味这种新语言的不同之处。

一个好方法是创建一组基本的测试程序。有了这些，就可以从这些相似之处开始学习。

你可以选择创建的一个测试程序是“猜数字”程序。电脑从 1 到 100 之间选择一个数字，让你猜这个数字。程序一直循环，直到你猜对为止。

“猜数字”程序练习了编程语言中的几个概念:


变量

输入

输出

条件判断

循环


这是学习一门新的编程语言的一个很好的实践实验。

注：本文改编自 Moshe Zadka 在 Julia 中使用这种方法和 Jim Hall在 Bash 中使用这种方法的文章。

在 awk 程序中猜数

让我们编写一个实现“猜数字”游戏的 Awk 程序。

前言
在 Flutter 中，若我们需要自定义画一张图，则需要用到 CustomPaint，不过 CustomPaint 并不是本篇文章的重点，所以我就直接贴出  CustomPaint  的相关代码，保证能够正常绘制即可。
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

  const MyHomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State createState() &#x3D;&gt; _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.white,
      child: CustomPaint(
        painter: MyPainter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyPainter extends CustomPainter {
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    canvas.drawRect(const Rect.fromLTRB(50, 50, 200, 200), Paint());
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}

                              <span>WELCOME 👋 friends to this new blog post. In this blog post, you will learn how to fetch data or get alerted whenever a row is inserted, updated, and deleted in the supabase Postgres database with the help of a supabase subscription, 😁Pretty easy to setup.
Suppose, I gave you a project of making a real-time chat app with supabase. Then you need to fetch data whenever a new chat is inserted, deleted, or updated.
First, you need to go to the supabase database settings:


**Note: **I have selected my tables, the table settings would be different from yours.
👀Note: The tables which are enabled by clicking the green button will be able to make real-time data fetching.
INSERT — Listening to the table if any new row is inserted


UPDATE— Listening to table if any row is updated


DELETE— Listening to table if any row is deleted


— Listening to the table for all the above changes.



you will get a response something like this:

Hello! In this quick tutorial I will show how to create a simple program using Python and Tesseract OCR that can extract text from image files. 😃
Tesseract is an open source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine that can recognize multiple languages. 
An OCR engine can save time by digitilizing documents rather than manually typing the content of the document.
Instalation method will vary on the Operating System you use. 
Instructions on how to download Tesseract can be found here:

                              <span>One major function of the Operating System is File Management.
File management means managing files so that files can be stored, retrieved, and modified easily.
There are different ways in which files are managed, every Operating system has its own way of dealing with files.
Windows xp,7,8,10,11 uses NTFS
Mac OS uses APFS
Let&#x27;s look deeper into NTFS
NTFS stands for New Technology File System.
It is the file system that the Windows NT operating system (OS) uses for storing and retrieving files on hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
NTFS offers several improvements over FAT and HPFS in terms of performance, extendibility, and security.
The file system essentially organizes the data into files. It controls how data files are named, stored, retrieved, and updated and what ot…</span>

Now previously, when I did the Pickle Rick CTF, I felt a little lost - or a bit in over my head. But once I put my mind to it and kept on persisting, it turned out to be pretty easy, and I promise you that the RootMe CTF is no different! 😊 
Today we will beat the RootMe CTF on Try Hack Me. So grab a comfy neck pillow, open up your terminal, and let&#x27;s get hacking.

Connect to TryHackMe network and deploy the machine. If you don&#x27;t know how to do this, complete the OpenVPN room first. 😁
Scan the machine, how many ports are open? 
nmap -sV 10.10.85.26 to find all the information needed for this task. 

Ports 22 and 80 are open , thus 2 ports are open.

While building an app you are bound to have multiple pages which you will need to click between. Setting up routes and pages is easy enough, but how do we build a button that can help us change routes once clicked? React, once again, comes to save the day! 
React hooks have had many changes as newer versions continue to be developed. In the previous version of React we would have used the useHistory() hook to solve our problem above, but useHistory() has officially been deprecated. With the introduction of React Router v6 we were officially introduced to useNavigate(). 
In order to achieve our goal, we will be using useNavigate(). useNavigate() can be used in several different ways, but our particular example below it will allow us to redirect our user to a di…</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s set one thing straight before we even dive into the article.
Divs are not buttons!
Yes, they are sometimes easier to style, but we should always opt for semantic HTML when introducing actionable items.
Alright, that&#x27;s out of the way. Now, let&#x27;s dive into the matter of links vs. buttons.
When we browse the modern-day web, you&#x27;ll struggle to differentiate buttons from links (let aside divs).
They can still easily distantiate between the two.
I see people frown and wonder, ok, I get it, but when do I use which one?
And the answer to that is straightforward.
A link will trigger a URL change.
A button will trigger an action.
Let&#x27;s look at some examples of valid links.

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].
Input: nums &#x3D; [2,5,1,3,4,7], n &#x3D; 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1&#x3D;2, x2&#x3D;5, x3&#x3D;1, y1&#x3D;3, y2&#x3D;4, y3&#x3D;7 
then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

In this technique we try to store two numbers at one Index by multiplying the number with 10000;
1000 so we are multiplying it with 10000, so that if the numbers are of 4 digits we can store all of them.
⚠ I&#x27;m using pointers for easy explanation but we can do it without them.
In first loop we store two numbers at one index.
// let&#x27;s say Our input is [1,2,3,4,5,6]

We will run our first loop from 0 to n / 2 - 1 and n / 2 to n - 1; So basically first pointer will run for [1,2,3] and second pointer will run …</span>

                              <span>I graduated from my SWE degree around 6 years ago (almost to the date). The uni I went to wasn’t one of those fancy big names you’d recognise but a rather small one in Wales, UK. It had a fairly decent curriculum and gave me the necessary skills to get a job in London. Lately though, I’ve started questioning what it means for me personally to work as a software engineer.
The loop

Figuring things out
The moments that I’ve felt amazing about what I do were always the ones where I would try to create something new - hook up to an interesting new API, a proof of concept for an idea that sounds fun to me or (more recently) making music. It seems to me that the common denominator between these was always the creative aspect of building something which doesn’t exist. Literally something which ha…</span>

Considere o diagrama abaixo. Ele representa parte de um sistema de negativação de títulos. Quando um devedor deixa de pagar um título, a empresa pode enviar o mesmo para o SERASA.

Note que a classe Departamento possui 2 dependências com classes de camadas mais baixas, e que lida com questões tecnológicas. O Departamento então busca os títulos a serem negativados em TitulosDAO (que acessa o banco de dados) e, de posse da lista de títulos, os envia à SERASA (que pode lidar com uma interface REST com o SERASA, por exemplo).
Para representarmos a dependência de uma classe por outra, criamos uma seta que aponte para a direção da dependência. Assim, existem 2 setas, saindo de Departamen…</span>

&quot;Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner.&quot;
For more detail, I recommend you to read bradfrost.
Some people also change the stages for their projects because the stages aren&#x27;t suitable for every project.

If you choose the month of January, the days will count up to 31.

There are tons of reason you should try independent development, and some reason I started independent development is...
Well, initially I used Django only for the development and deployed the webapps in the server. But really there&#x27;s a reason I used Django for it... The reason is I was learning Django for the sole purpose of making those webapps, and I knew no other web frameworks.
Some of my very common/new web apps...
YouTube Tag Generator
Related Keyword Generator
Linkedin Hashtags Generator
Actually, I didn&#x27;t completely switched to React/NextJs, I only switched the front-end part of my web apps. The back-end still is in Django.
I had to secure my web apps in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t leaks the back-end part, I didn&#x27;t wanted the backend to be public.
next-csrf for this task.
The best part is that with all of this hustle and hard work, it&#x27;s going to pay me off with nice Google Adsense revenue. NFT Name Generator is one of my most popular web app. And, I it&#x27;s paying my nice.

Code for applications written using C usually has multiple source files, but ultimately you will need to compile them into a single executable.
You can do this in two ways: by creating a static library or a dynamic library (also called a shared library). These two types of libraries vary in terms of how they are created and linked. Your choice of which to use depends on your use case.
In a previous article, I demonstrated how to create a dynamically linked executable, which is the more commonly used method. In this article, I explain how to create a statically linked executable.

                              <span>昨晚，Kindle 中国区将在未来的一年里停止购买、未来的两年里停止下载的信息。

官方的声明
而作为一个持有多个 Kindle 的 Kindle 读者，我愿意称自己为 Kindle 难民。不过，难民归难民，在当下还是要思考接下来怎么处理。出二手我肯定是不打算，因为 Kindle 官方的新闻一出， Kindle 在二手市场的价格必然是要暴跌的（倒是可以从收藏的视角来在二手市场上收一些想要的 Kindle）。继续使用的话，就要想 Kindle 对我们的影响有多大。
先说结论：

对于喜欢线上购买图书并等 Kindle 推送的人来说，有可切换方案；
对于喜欢使用 Send To Kindle 的人来说，有可切换方案；
对于喜欢使用 Kindle 硬件来读书的人，继续使用数据线就行，不影响你的使用。
对于想要趁机切换至其他平台人来说，是个好时候，各家应该会做定向的营销。

再说细节：
1. Kindle 停止运行的重要时间节点
Kindle 对于我们的影响主要是在两个时间点：2023 年 6 月 23 日和 2024 年 6 月 40 日。

在 2023 年的 6 月 23 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 商店当中购买我们喜欢的图书（还有一年时间缓冲）。
在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 当中下载我们已经购买好的图书。
在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日之后，我们只能通过 Kindle 数据线连接电脑的方式来下载图书到 Kindle 当中阅读。

所以从短期来看，我们依然可以继续使用 Kindle 愉快的读书而没有丝毫的影响。但长期来看，如果你更喜欢线上随时选购的方案，那迁移到其他平台是必然的选择。
2. Kindle 商店停止运行后，还能做什么？
国区 Kindle 商店的停止运行，让我们失去随时购买图书的体验，如果我们想要继续可以实…</span>

几年前在另外一个共同朋友家认识的，
平时来往不太多，偶尔他需要咨询我点什么技术问题就会来找我，
每次来都会带一堆礼品，茶叶跟某地特产什么的（他经常需要出差到处飞），看起来价值不低，
收的次数多了没有礼尚往来我感觉不太合适，何况人家还高我几个级别。
所以我想回礼，如果还是回茶叶之类的传统礼品我不懂也不符合我的性格会很突兀。
不过好在对方也是一个老程序猿（至今还在参与一线码代码），
所以感觉乘着 618 搞一把好键盘意思一下也行。
他公司我去过（他是公司老板），他办公位用的还是那种几十块包邮的键盘（好像是双飞燕？）。他公司是那种开放式的大厅，他跟他的员工一起码代码，所以不能太吵或者太张扬的。
目前很纠结不知道哪把比较好。请各位大佬帮忙推荐一下性价比高的入门级键盘（我的预算 1K 以内）。
谢谢。</span>

实际运行的效果是 Qt 开发的应用在 Mac 上的性能接近原生了，而用 GTK+开发的应用在 Mac 上卡得很，代码拿到 Ubuntu 上编译运行就很流畅，Ubuntu 是 gnome 的桌面环境，这点不意外。
同样是 C/C++程序，为什么 GTK+的应用在 Mac 上性能就不如 Qt ？
另外 gnome 官方的 UI 设计工具 Glade 在 Mac 系统上卡到几乎用不了，有没有 Linux 大佬了解这个情况？</span>

如题，最近刚知道 css 可以用 var 语法动态更新，但现在遇到了一个问题：如果背景用 var 的话，其他 var 变化的时候背景就会闪一下，如果是连续变化就会一直闪白。感觉原因是更新其中一个 var ，全部 var 都会重新载入一遍。。。
如何解决这个问题？
示例代码：
这个例子里，如果实时改变--color1 ，背景会一直闪白

我要生成如下 xml 文件




id
pwd
serviceid


13013001300
测试




代码为
package main

import (
&quot;encoding/xml&quot;
&quot;fmt&quot;
&quot;os&quot;
)

type Client struct {
Id        string &#x60;xml:&quot;client&gt;id&quot;&#x60;
Pwd       string &#x60;xml:&quot;client&gt;pwd&quot;&#x60;
Serviceid string &#x60;xml:&quot;client&gt;serviceid&quot;&#x60;
}

type Sms_info struct {
Phone   string &#x60;xml:&quot;sms_info&gt;phone&quot;&#x60;
Content string &#x60;xml:&quot;sms_info&gt;content&quot;&#x60;
}

type Sms struct {
XMLName xml.Name &#x60;xml:&quot;sms&quot;&#x60;
Ver     string   &#x60;xml:&quot;ver,attr&quot;&#x60;
Client
Sms_info
}

type Svc_init struct {
XMLName xml.Name &#x60;xml:&quot;svc_init&quot;&#x60;
Ver     string   &#x60;xml:&quot;ver,attr&quot;&#x60;
Sms
}

func main() {
id :&#x3D; &quot;id&quot;
pwd :&#x3D; &quot;pwd&quot;
serviceid :&#x3D; &quot;serviceid&quot;

client :&#x3D; Client{Id: id, Pwd: pwd, Serviceid: serviceid}
sms_info :&#x3D; Sms_info{Phone: &quot;13013001300&quot;, Content: &quot;测试&quot;}

sms :&#x3D; Sms{Ver: &quot;2.0.0&quot;, Client: client, Sms_info: sms_info}

v :&#x3D; Svc_init{Ver: &quot;2.0.0&quot;, Sms: sms}

fmt.Println(v)
output, _ :&#x3D; xml.MarshalIndent(v, &quot;  &quot;, &quot;    &quot;)

os.Stdout.Write(output)
}

运行后生成


id
pwd
serviceid


13013001300
测试



可以看到结果的 sms 结构丢失了
但是我直接打印 v 值
{{ } 2.0.0 {{ } 2.0.0 {id pwd serviceid} {13013001300 测试}}}

可以看到 sms 结构还在
请问为什么会这样，然后如何修复呢，感谢。</span>

主要是作为快捷输入工具，可以替换默认的英文输入法。功能和 Alfred 这样的工具比较接近（其实我也有打算做成 Alfred 这样的，想想还是算了，玩具项目还是玩具到底

家里有 n 台机器，其中一台扔到厕所作为服务器了。里面装了 ubuntu 20.04 并开启了远程桌面功能，方便管理。
今天登录机器发现 git pull 命令出错，很奇怪，于是下意识的 敲了下命令 df -lh 看一下硬盘占用的情况。
没想到 / 居然满了。。 具体一点儿是 /var/log/syslog 爆了，里面大概 200G 的日志，还好有一个 是昨天的，于是乎删掉。 截取了一部分日志，发现是有机器在爆破密码。。。
于是 ip 拿到了，顺着 ip 找过去，拿到了他的一些肉鸡信息。 原来是是各种扫描就上来了，于是收货了一批 账号密码组合。
116.48.1xx.xxx:5900 12345678 -&gt; s000 ( 192.168.0.20 ) - service mode
发几个，感觉是什么控制终端。humm 邪恶的想法滋生了😈，在自己机器被入侵的情况下有啥法子进行反击。
思考到有个东西是蜜罐，但是针对这样的扫描 难道需要 fail2ban 来进行处理 ？
或者有啥高端的玩儿法,打击他们的扫描，写个死循环让他们夏天烤一下电炉子 ？</span>

MDN Web Docs 是 Web 开发者最频繁查看的参考文档，包含 HTML 、CSS 、JavaScript 等 Web API 。
平时为了查 MDN 上的文档需要 2 步：
1. 在地址栏上输入 “mdn + 空格 + 关键字”（ mdn 用于提示 google 我想要找 mdn 上的结果而不是其它网站）。
2. 点击 google 搜索结果页面中的链接跳转到 MDN 页面。
为了进一步提升效率，将 2 步变为 1 步，我做了一个 MDN Search 浏览器扩展：
1. 在地址栏上输入 “mdn + tab/space + 关键字” 即刻给出 MDN 上的搜索提示，然后直接进入 MDN 页面就行了。
注：给出的搜索提示是在本地离线得出的。

楼主 95 的 今年要 27 了 本科在国外念的（参加高考了考上同济 就先按 985 算）研究生美国 top30 学的土木
19 年年中在啥也不会的情况下被捞进一个房地产公司写 Java 去年年底离职 工作时长两年半
我前司那个技术组基本就是写公司内部系统的 程序员前后端加起来算上我总共五个人 
我这两年半基本就写写增删改查 好吧也是我当时心思不在这上面 先是入职不久家里出事整个人精神恍惚了大半年 之后想去日本念大学院（那边主流不是申请完了等 offer 是要考试的 而且多是线下考试 考数学和一些 CS 基础课）就每天下班回家学日语刷高数.. 啥 Java 基础框架等等是一点没补 后来看这疫情搞得闭关锁国来回极其不方便就放弃了
去年为啥辞职呢 本来还想再在职学习苟一阵的 结果跟同事关系恶化到每天想到要上班都失眠吃不下饭 就走了
辞职之后的半年休息了一个多月 然后就是以一个极慢的速度补课.. 我也很惊讶自己以前居然能在压根不会继承 /泛型 /线程 /etc..的情况下还能有班上 因为是在家自己看也不像考研啥的还有个 ddl 结果就是拖延 半年里可能也就巩固了个 java 基础浅看了下 spring(甚至还没看完)补了下计网刷了 300 多道 leetcode
现在家里的意思是赶紧滚出去投面试不能再拖了 问题我太知道自己啥水平了 简历都没得可写 我说还需要点时间吧我也不知道具体需要多久 而且呆在家里面对海量没接触过的知识 还没学先因为绝望丧大半天 感觉也不是办法于是想来向大家请教怎么在最短的时间里面向面试努力 （也考虑过再念个二硕不过这都等找到口饭吃再说吧）我的最终目标就是上岸一个不算特别小的能用到面试问的那些技术的非外包厂..
之前也想过直接在不懂的情况下直接开背八股 但是看了下各路面经 我就在怀疑怎么能在自己完全不懂的情况下光靠背给一个懂的人讲明白
还有讲项目 我原来公司里那个我是非常确信真的没啥可讲的了（至少我负责的部分没啥可说的）这种情况要写点什么放在简历上好</span>

2020 年 8 月买的

2021 年 7 月，还差几天，差不多就要过保了的时候，坏了 部分按键没反应，淘宝返修了

然后前几天，还差几天满一年了，又又又坏了，部分按键没反应。又是快一年的时候，我都怀疑这个键盘的设计寿命只有一年，每次都是差不多的时间。
这家店的客服也是没把我当正常人，以为在外面，拍不了照片。我反复说我已经插拔好几次了，吃奶的劲都用了，然后还是要看照片，也不说接下来的售后流程

麻了，准备趁 618 看看其他键盘了</span>

动机: 平时使用 EasyMotion 比较多, 中文写作也比较多, 苦恼于 EasyMotion 对中文不支持, 后在 GitHub 上看到 vim-easymotion-chs 插件, 它可以让 EasyMotion 识别中文, 但是和我想象的还是有点差距, 恰好自己熟悉小鹤双拼, 所以我动手改了下, 制作了一个基于小鹤双拼的版本, 现在用了一年多, 还挺好用,现共享出来, 希望能帮到有相同需求的人.
使用条件: 需要熟悉 Vim + EasyMotion + 小鹤双拼.

上海复工了，作为第一批被叫到公司的人内心本就诸多不爽。研究了一下 72h 核酸的时效，昨晚排了 2 小时的队，经历了 1 人一管到没管子，做到我的时候已经 10 人一管了，不过总算做好了。
回家后感觉十分疲惫，昨天体感温度在 30 度左右，湿度 73%，直接洗漱躺着。早上 6 点被吵醒，看了一眼核酸结果依旧没出，躺到 7 点起床洗漱，上一次核酸是在 30 号的 8：17 ，只要我在 8：17 前进地铁扫码应该问题不大。
下车后发现公司边上的小桃园开了，只能打包，不知道是打包费还是涨价了，多收了我 1 块钱。由于 72h 核酸已过期，没去便利店。
中午了，结果依旧没出，找了一家馄饨店，没扫码直接点了一份回公司吃（商务楼发了通行证，有通行证的不用扫码）。
现在是 2022 年 06 月 02 日 13:38 ，依旧没结果，看了一下回家骑车要 40 分钟，还好，可以接受。不知道是我哪管出问题了还是昨天的量太多没检测完，总之影响的不是决策者和执行者。</span>

                              <span>i3x: 今天中午突然专线不可用了。收到机房服务器被动告警设备离线。我本来是用 LTE 网络后备，用于现场发现网络故障电源故障等问题后主动告警。
但是我遇到的情况是：
基站传输网出现故障。
基站和宽带使用的是同一个网络。也是同时故障的。
因此 LTE 渠道告警信息也无法发出。当收到被动的告警通知的时候，也不明确现场到底发生了什么？
因为某厂商销售虚拟化产品，所谓的宽带接入网与 lte 网共享传输效率更好不浪费，计算也因为虚拟化弹性动态分配宽带网和移动数据网。
事后对接的电信技术问我我那边网络恢复了没，刚才有一台机器起不来。
另外我这边不仅仅是宽带，专线都已经很肯定的部署了该厂商的 pcdn 防护方案，爱奇艺都看不了了更别说京东云。有爱奇艺会员，不过仍然一卡一卡。。根据网页版调试信息，爱奇艺本质仍然是用着 pcdn 传输分发。。。能看就有鬼了。。
同样 b 站之类的好一些站点都被干扰无法使用。
感情装专线以后也只能刷奶头乐短视频是吧。。。
求解我该怎么投诉才能有效？
农村网络，确实长视频受众少适合瞎搞。
399 的普通宽带一条，光收发专线一条。问题是都接入的同一套网络上游，其实差距不大。
我现在测速能满。
国内好一些长视频网站无法正常播放，包括客户端都受到干扰。附近的小卖部没有宽带，用的我的网。现在看不了电视剧，抱怨的很。我偶尔也突然想看一会儿现在完全不给机会。
由于测速能满，所以宽带没有故障。装维和机房的让我别投诉了，扣他钱。
确实京东云之类的或者 ipes 都完全不跑量了，问题是视频也看不成了。

根据网上公开信息，几乎所有的省份都采购了该系统。。。短视频利好？长视频会员等着涨价？
除了 LTE 还有什么方法后备网络？</span>

我经常会遇到这样的场景，在嘈杂的环境中使用降噪听歌，然后忽然有电话打进来了
这时候如果断开耳机使用手机听筒和麦克风通话的话，因为环境嘈杂，可能听不见对方在说什么
如果用降噪耳机，可以清楚听到对方说话内容，但是 AirPods Pro 的麦克风收音实在是太糟糕了，对方经常听不清楚我在说什么
所以我就在想，能不能像电脑一样，使用耳机输出音频，使用手机内置麦克风收音呢？</span>

00. 本月好文推荐：《 The Internet Origin Story You Know Is Wrong 》
在社交媒体的传播中，互联网的起源基本都围绕一个由军方资助的封包交换网络 Arpanet 展开，事实上，BBS 在当时也是最为流行的网络形式之一，并聚集了初代网民绝大部分的思想、技术与文化的交流，这对互联网的诞生提供了极为重要的社会性价值。
我们在回顾互联网的历史时，过于强调由上而下的力量，却忽略了个人和草根网络推动的力量。这个故事是否也在提醒我们，互联网应该容许更多不同形式的出现与发展，我们所理解、依赖的互联网，或许尚不是一个最为完整、完美的形态。你很容易发现，最近的 Web 3.0 概念正在有意无意地重新解释那个令人向往的…</span>

重启路由，重新连接，信道排查，甚至 iPad 重新恢复系统，等各种方式都试了一遍之后，还是没有变化。
昨天看着两个设备相近的网速，突然想到之前 ATV+HP 的组合也是这个样子，Reddit 上有人发了帖子，说 HP 会影响 ATV 的无线网速，目前找个问题依然存在。我就考虑到 mac 和 iPad 是不是也是同理，但是又没有头绪。
我偶然间移动鼠标的时候，触发了通用控制，然后我就想这个功能是基于 Wi-Fi+蓝牙(好像)来实现的，所以有没有可能这个功能影响网速。关掉后，果然网速变得正常了。
不知道我是不是个例。</span>

                              <span>jackyin: 最近家里小店的微信商户不能结算了，说是需要重新上传身份证。
首先，是搞不懂，身份证资料都没过期，干嘛突然就要重新上传，有何意义呢，不还是原来的身份证吗？办了这么多年的银行卡，没听说身份证没过期要重新上传审核的，也没听说银行要审核这么多天的。
其次，是上传后没有任何审核状态，就让人干等，打电话找客服，直接就是等待中，听半天音乐也等不到，然后就是微信上收到微信客服消息，让从微信上反馈问题，然后就是等，等几天客服回复资料要审核 3-7 天，审核通过后再等 1-2 天恢复结算。也就是上传个身份证至少要审核 10 天，如果最后再说你不清晰什么的，再 10 天咯。
整个过程没有任何地方有提示审核状态，想问客服也是找不到真人客服，客服比外星人还难找。
然后我就上 app store 上看看能不能在评论里反馈反馈问题，不看不知道，一看吓了好几跳，腾讯从来不回复用户评论，各种问题反馈从来不搭理，作为对比，我看了下抖音的，至少人家还回复回复，虽然都是套话，腾讯是套话都不愿意说了。
像腾讯企业微信做的稀巴烂，我看 V 站现在至少就有 583633 人能比他们做的好，评分那么低，反馈里真的都是实实在在的问题反馈，各种吐槽，但是腾讯一个也不搭理。
更搞笑的是在企业微信里想要注销企业，不能直接注销，提示需要找客服处理，不让注销就直说，让人找客服不是故意刁难吗？
作为对比，我查了下中国移动，中国移动 2021 年赚了 1160 亿，客服人员 5 万+，客服基本随时都能打通。
腾讯呢，2021 年赚了 2250 亿，客服是 0 吗？从来找不到，像微信支付商户和企业微信这样面向企业的产品都找不到客服人员。
花点噻，客服能花多少呢，就算提供 5 万个客服岗位，每人每年 10 万，也就 50 亿，不过是 2250 亿的零头的零头，既提供了更好的用户体验，又能提供这么多的就业岗位，当企业赚这么多钱以后就不能多为社会做点贡献吗？
飞信的事儿当年要是成了，至少现在能找到他们的客服吧。
呜呼飞信，不幸夭亡！
哀其不幸，怒其不争！
悲哉飞信，惜哉飞信！
资本真的太坏了，希望国家谨慎之。
也希望国家能尽快完善相关法律法规，企业应当配备足够的客服人员。
吐槽一下，也知没甚鸟用，只是胸有不平，不得不鸣，诸位哥哥们不要介意哈。
一声叹息，唉～～～～～～</span>

Ei dev,
Aceita um desafio pra lidar com restrição de memória?
Gere um arquivo várias linhas com cerca de 100MB de tamanho;
Faça um programa que leia esse arquivo e printe o resultado como na imagem;
Dockerize ele e o execute com limite de memória de 20m;
cc @sseraphini

O principal desafio aqui é trabalhar com um arquivo que não caiba na memória do processo. Usar o Docker é apenas uma sugestão para limitar a memória; se você conhece outros meios de fazer isso, manda bala!
Ah, os valores de tamanho de arquivo e memória são apenas uma sugestão.
Note que se for realmente usar o Docker, terá que copiar o arquivo para a imagem :)

                              <span>A mobile app lifecycle is divided into various stages, from its first line of code to the submission request. Within these stages, one aspect that holds the key to creating an app is its testing. This field carries the burden of quality and stamps an application to guarantee that no storm would break it down.
In this blog, we will talk about things that matter when mobile app testing is done. For example, why do some apps show more trust but some don’t even after passing through the same testing phases? What is that subtle difference that can make all the difference? What can we do to make “testing” right?
Before exploring the answers to these questions and analyzing their impact, let’s understand why it is important to test mobile apps on multiple devices.

Currently in .NET 6, to achieve span context tracking of the different threads being managed, the most common is to use AsyncLocal for this purpose.

Task 4: Automated Enumeration Tools

And looking at that from an accessibility point of view, I could see many things to improve on!
The most basic form tabs are simple. A restructure of a table of contents and some headings.

The image above shows both a table of contents page and a tabbed version.
The big downside with the table of contents setup is that we have to tab through all links to get to the content.
You can try it out on this CodePen.




While this method has some downsides, let&#x27;s see what we need to convert this into fully accessible tabs:
Show the navigation horizontal
Show the content as actual tab content
Tabs navigation should not be controlled by tab but rather by the left and right arrows
Active tabs should have an aria indication

Having all the latest features and a responsive design that is compatible across browsers improves the search engine ranking of a website, resulting in growth of audience. However, when the project is huge, developers often fail to adhere to the best UI practices. Thereby resulting in a website where some important functionality is not working or one where cross browser testing is not entirely performed. Here, we shall discuss the 17 reasons that lead to UI design failure for a website and certain UI design tips to avoid those setbacks.
Today, all organizations are following the mobile first approach. It is ideal that you must think alike your competitors and develop a website that adheres to the best UI practices related to respon…</span>

Despite the fact that the main goals are the same everywhere, there are many differences from project to project: different stacks, technologies, processes and approaches. Analyzing the processes in many teams, Qameta Software has found one problem. That problem is inefficiency. Currently, testing is one of the most under-optimized processes in the development life cycle. 
Today, we will try to understand how it happened and what we can do about it.
Usually, at the beginning of the project there is no tester, and the developer and the tentative manager are responsible for the quality of the product and the bugs found. Everything is fine in this world, because if the manager finds a bug, he sends it to the developer for correction; the developer fixes the bug, and everyo…</span>

In todays tutorial we will take a look at a cool new feature that is available to us in Azure Bastion whereby we can upload and download files to a VM using a native client. You can read more about this feature on Microsoft Docs.
With the new Azure Bastion native client support, available with Standard SKU, you can now:
Connect to your target Azure virtual machine via Azure Bastion using Azure CLI and a native client on your local machine.
Log into Azure Active Directory-joined virtual machines using your Azure Active Directory credentials.
Access the features available with your chosen native client (ex: file transfer).
Today we will look specifically at how we can upload files from a Windows OS based local machine using WinSCP to a Linux Azure VM using Azure Bastion in Tunnel …</span>

                              <span>In this post let&#x27;s talk about the paradigm shift from lifecycle methods to state synchronization and hooks in ReactJs.
Here is a video version of this post, if that&#x27;s what you prefer. 




When class components were a thing in ReactJs (Well it still is, but no one likes them anymore), we use to think a lot in terms of mouting, unmounting, and lifecycle methods.

Whenever a class component mounts, the lifecycle methods are called in following sequence: constructor → render → DOM and refs update → componentDidMount
But then came React Hooks, and we started to think in terms of dependency array.
And, often times we ask:
What is the hooks equivalent to [some lifecycle method]?
The quick answer is that hooks are a paradigm shift from thinking in terms of &quot;lifecycles&quot; to thinking in terms of &quot;state and synchronization with DOM&quot;. Trying to take the old paradigm and apply it to hooks just doesn&#x27;t work out very well and can hold you back.
useEffect(fn) // fn invoked on all updates

useEffect(fn, []) // invoked on mount

useEffect(fn, [a, b, c]) // invoked if any of the members of the array are updated

The above snippet is not the right way to think about React hook.
Lifecycles are gone, but we still think of useEffect with empty dep array as componentDidMount, and that’s not the right way to think about React Hooks.
Now I want to present to you the right way to think about react hooks.
See, the question is not &quot;when does this effect run&quot; the question is &quot;which state does this effect synchronizes with&quot;
useEffect(fn) // useEffect with no dep array, sync with all state

useEffect(fn, []) // useEffect with empty dep array, sync with no state

useEffect(fn, [stateA, stateB]) // useEffect with stateA and stateB in dep array sync with stateA and stateB.

And that’s how you should think about React Hooks.

There was not much left to do for the landing page. All that remained was creating the assets and applying a couple of minor updates here and there.

Sony’s latest State of Play showcase gave a glimpse into what games will support the launch of the PlayStation VR2 (PSVR2) headset. Neither a price or release date has been shared yet for the headset, but at least we know what kind of games we can look forward to. For what it’s worth, Sony committed to launching the headset with 20 “major” games, so it’s still got a bit of work to do to fill the gaps. We’ve covered the main highlights below, including trailers.
Horizon Call of the Mountain continues to look good
Guerilla Games showed off some combat and traversal gameplay for its upcoming PSVR2 exclusive game, Horizon Call of the Mountain. Like the console game, there seems to be a heck of a lot of climbing, and the visuals look...

Tablets exist in a space between phones and laptops that is becoming increasingly muddled. As phones become more powerful and gain larger displays, laptops continue to get lighter. Tablet manufacturers haven’t been resting on their laurels, though. Many of the more recent tablets we’ve seen are looking to bridge the gap in terms of performance and, in select cases, handle some tasks more efficiently than both phones and laptops.
The tablet spectrum is varied, too. Inexpensive models like the Amazon Fire HD 10 make for excellent media streaming devices, while those in Microsoft’s versatile Surface lineup can easily serve as ad-hoc laptops when paired with an optional folio-style keyboard. Then there’s the ubiquitous iPad, a slate that has...

But now we have a new release date, and it’s soon: the game is coming out on July 19th. (It was originally slated to launch in early 2022.) It’ll be coming to the PS4 and PS5, as well as PC. And if you’re not sure what all of the fuss is about, there’s a brand-new trailer above showcasing all the futuristic feline action. It looks equal parts adorable and stressful, and I swear that if anything happens to that little kitty, I will absolutely lose it.

If you’re a Final Fantasy fan, today’s State of Play is for you. Today, Square Enix has revealed a bit more information about Final Fantasy XVI.
In the new trailer, we get our first glimpse of combat, which features high-speed real-time action that looks reminiscent of what Cloud and the gang get up to in Final Fantasy VII Remake. The trailer also features more of the mysterious Eikons, powerful monsters that resemble the summons of Final Fantasies of yore and seem to reside in human controllers called Dominants. It seems like befriending or fighting these Dominants will be at the heart of the game’s story.
Final Fantasy XVI was revealed in 2020 with a bloody trailer that was unlike anything the usually bright and hopeful series usually...

                              <span>Sony announced during its June 2022 State of Play showcase that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Remastered from Insomniac Games is coming to PC on August 12th, 2022. This title debuted on PS5 as a launch title. The company didn’t share a price for the PC version, but like previous games, it’s coming to Steam and Epic Games Store. In a follow-up blog post, Insomniac Games confirmed that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is coming to PC sometime in the fall.
There’s likely much more news to come — at least for spec nerds. The remastered edition of the game contains all DLC, and on the PS5, it came with some impressive graphical features, including ray tracing. Suffice to say, similar settings should be coming to the PC version, too. Sony showed off...

Meta is rolling out a new ‘Calls’ tab globally in its Messenger app for iOS and Android users. The new tab will keep track of each call you make or receive in the app in one place and make it easier to connect calls with one tap. Also, for people who don’t regularly use the feature, it adds a clear reminder that they can use the app for voice or video calls in addition to text-based messaging.
In 2014, Facebook pulled messaging out of the main Facebook app, pushing mobile users to download a separate one to continue using the feature as part of its push to make Messenger a singular experience. The video call feature arrived in 2015, followed by cross-app messaging with Instagram and eventually cross-app group chats. Most recently, it a...

While Google confirmed last month that a Pixel Watch is on its way, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the device, like its hardware specs. The rumor mill has been buzzing, however, and the gist is the device will purportedly feature a 300mAh battery and Samsung’s last-gen wearable processor. The latest report from 9to5 Google claims that the watch will get around 24 hours of battery life on a single charge and that fast charging isn’t in the mix. It might be tempting to cry doom and gloom, but if this pans out? These numbers are par for the course.
Battery life remains one of the biggest challenges for smartwatch makers. Try to pack in a larger battery to get more juice and end up with a gargantuan watch that excludes anyone with...

BMW has redesigned its X1 compact SUV and is introducing an all-electric version of it. The new iX1 xDrive30 is the company’s latest EV option built on its fifth-generation eDrive platform, the same one that the new BMW i4 is built on. Unfortunately, BMW spokesperson Jay Hanson tells The Verge there are currently no plans to offer the iX1 in the US.
The German automaker will be building the new X1s in Regensburg, where gasoline, diesel, plug-in hybrid, hybrid, and all-electric versions of the vehicle will be built on one assembly line. BMW is calling the refreshed X1 vehicles compact SAVs, or “Sports Activity Vehicles,” in an effort to better differentiate the entry-level compacts from the rest of the X line. Noticeable changes in the...

Amazon’s current Echo lineup offers a broad selection of smart speakers and displays that can fit just about anywhere in your home. Whether you want to place a voice assistant in your living room, replace the bulletin board in your office, or pick up a touchscreen-enabled device to showcase recipes in the kitchen, there&#x27;s an Echo device for just about every occasion and use case. 
Regardless of why you might want one, there’s always a way to save on an Echo device, from the last-gen Dot to Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10. Even when they’re selling at full price, for instance, Amazon offers a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices, meaning there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are on sale.

宣传片纯属自制，与最终003航母下水官宣的信息如有雷同，纯属巧合。

1. Component 的树形结构
通过前面八篇的尝鲜，或说预热，我们可以感知到无论是主角、怪兽、文字、子弹、触点都是 Component 。它是游戏的基本构建模块，可以表示任何需要被渲染、更新的内容。

下面是 Component 类的部分结构，可以看出 Component 是一个普通类。其本身会持有父级构件，以及子级构件集合。也就是说 Component 本身是一个树形结构的节点类，认识到这一点至关重要。

正是由于树形结构的特点，C…</span>

                              <span>功耗优化是应用体验优化的一个重要课题，高功耗会引发用户的电量焦虑，也会导致糟糕的发热体验，从而降低了用户的使用意愿。而功耗又是涉及整机的长时间多场景的综合性复杂指标，影响因素很多。不论是功耗的量化拆解，还是异常问题的监控，以及主动的功耗优化对于开发人员来说都是很有挑战性的。
本文结合抖音的功耗优化实践中产出了一些实验结论，优化思路，从功耗的基础知识，功耗组成，功耗分析，功耗优化等几个方面，对 Android 应用的功耗优化做一个总结沉淀。
功耗基础知识介绍
首先我们回顾一下功耗的概念，这里比较容易和能耗搞混。解释一下为什么手机上用mA(电流值) 来表征功耗水平，用 mAh（物理意义上是电荷值）来表征能耗水平。我们先来看几个物理公式。
P &#x3D; I × U， E &#x3D; P × T
能耗（E）：即能量损耗，指计算机系统一段时间内总的能量消耗，单位是焦耳(J)
功耗（P）：即功率损耗，指单位时间内的能量消耗，反映消耗能量的速率，单位是瓦特(W)
电流（I）：指手机电池放电的电流值，手机常用 mA 为单位
电压（U）：指手机电池放电的电压值，标准放电电压 3.7V，充电截止电压 4.35V，放电截止电压 2.75V （以典型值举例，不同设备的电池电压数值有差异）
电池容量 ：常用单位 mAh，从单位意义上看是电荷数，实际表征的是电池以典型电压放电的时长。
如下面的功耗测试图所示，手机通常以恒定的典型电压工作，为了计算方便，就把电压恒定为 3.7V，那么 P &#x3D; I × 3.7， E &#x3D; I × 3.7 × T，即用 mA 表征功耗，mAh 表征能耗。
总结：对同一机型，我们用电池容量(mAh)变化的来表征一段时间总能耗，用平均电流(mA)来表征功耗水平；如 4000mAh 电池的手机刷抖音 1 小时耗电 11%，耗电量(能耗)440mAh，平均电流 440mA

                              <span>最近两天看完了我 2022 年第一本纸质书，麦家新作《人生海海》。今年都快过去一半了，看完了 16 本书，1 本纸质书，15 本都是在微信读书上看的电子书。但是，最爱还是纸质书。

阿根廷著名文学家博尔赫斯说过一句话，“这世界上如果有天堂，应该是图书馆的模样”，那我觉得图书馆应该是纸质书的天堂。很难想象，置身电子图书馆，周围没有一本纸质书，闭着眼睛都能感受到一种冷清的气氛。相比纸质书，我觉得它保留了读书人的气质，温文尔雅有感情的气质。
不过话说回来，纸质书与电子书的讨论一直没有停止，围绕它们俩的优缺点，能说上一大堆，我以自己一个喜欢读书的学生的视角，说说我眼中的纸质书。
纸质书的缺点
重量
我从网上查到的信息显示，一本 16 开 300 页左右的书大约在 180g~240g 之间，对比我们日常使用的手机，也在 180g~250g 之间，俗称半斤重的手机（参考 iPhone 13 Pro Max），这其实说明纸质书是比较笨重的，单本书的重量或许能接受，但遇到那种分上下册，或者需要同时带两本以上的书在身上时，就显得特别的不方便。
当然，也有的人选择在固定的场所和时间看书，比如只在自己的房间书桌上，这样即便是很重很厚的书，也没有多大的影响。
体积
我房间里有一个二合一的书桌，桌子与书柜二合一，说大不大的书柜，也装满了我从小到大看的书，要是还想继续往里面放，就有点困难了，一是占空间，二是容易积灰，遇到南方的回潮天，纸质书也容易受潮发霉，需要不定时拿出来翻动晒一晒。
价格
高三有一次看大冰的《小孩》，作者提到该书定价的事情，39.6 元，这是大冰和编辑“博弈”之后的结果，《小孩》是大冰有史以来字数最多的一本书，在如今的市场规律与成本重压之下，仍然以不高于 40 元的定价，已经很难得了。在编辑的推荐语上，也写着“他怕他的读者买不起书，怕他的读者饿着肚子花一天的饭钱买书”。 难怪被网友恶…</span>

需求
这学期，我们这儿从头到尾上网课，有些让人始料未及。
其实从 2020 年开始，上网课已经不新鲜了。但是一门课完全线上进行，甚至还包括了在线考试，这还真是第一次。
很多老师，都在担心教学效果，毕竟线上线下的环境差别很大。我一开始也不例外，着实有些焦虑。好在经过实践，发现因为有了飞书和 芦笋这样的工具，教学效果最大程度上有了保障。甚至，还收获了一些超越线下教学的益处。本文，我把自己的使用经验分享给你。主要分成以下 4 个部分：

视频会议；
通知与资料分享；
分组协作；
检索回放。

会议
首先，是飞书的视频会议功能。
我这学期开设了两门课，一门本科生，一门研究生的。我把全部的授课互动，都放在飞书会议里进行。
飞书的会议，有个非常大的好处，就是会议的组织者可以对谁该参加，谁还没加入来，可以做到一目了然。这样，压根儿就不需要点名，也用不着总去催促学委一一核对了。
上课时间到了，扫一眼，截个图，考勤结果就出来了。
我有的时候会在快要上课时，把还没进会议室的同学名字直接截屏贴一下，作为提醒。

然后嘛，就像是有魔法，他们总是很快就进来了。
在我的 M1 芯片 Mac 上面，不知道什么原因，腾讯会议不支持以 mmhmm audio 作为声音输入来源，但是飞书会议从来没有遇到问题。我在授课时候利用 mmhmm 播放视频，飞书观众的效果总是清晰流畅。
上课过程中，我会让学生在飞书群里面 call 1 作为回答的顺序。这样问答有序，计分的同学也比较容易查看到原始记录。

课程开始之前，我都会开启视频录制功能。不需要占用本地空间，所有会议内容都自动上传到服务器，并且通过飞书妙记功能，自动转换成为文字版会议纪要，还能提取关键词等。

如果有必要的话，可以把妙记文档转换成为飞书文档，共享给因为特殊事项（例如统一测核酸…</span>

2021 年度征文中我介绍了我的装修经历和复盘，装修接近尾声，设备和家具都陆续进场。这次先带大家看看，我家厨房已经添置了哪些设备和好物。
自动增压泵
品牌型号：威乐 201EH
价格：780 元 + 200 元安装费
推荐度：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
厨房好物第一站，从自动增压泵开始说起。如果你家是老小区的高楼层，我非常建议你安装自动增压泵。像我家是 1996 年的建造的房子，楼层为 6 楼。前两年在租出去时，租客就反馈水压小，特别到了冬季进水压力不足，热水器会因水压过小无法正常使用。所以我装修初期，就已经计划安装自动增压泵。

选购有自动控制器的型号
增压泵的结构氛围两个部分，下部蓝绿色卧式离心泵（增压泵本体），上部接自动控制器。一定选择有自动控制器的版本，因为泵本体是不会自动关停的，接上电源它就会一直工作。有了自动控制器才能适用到我们的日常水龙头等用水需求。当有用水信号发出后，就会触发自动控制器，启动增压泵进行工作。结合房屋面积，我选择了功率较小的 201EH，目前感觉也足够日常生活使用。
相关 tips
不过，虽然是「低噪运行」，增压泵的声音还是无法忽略的，即使增加了泡沫垫，还是能听到噪声。噪声主要来自于机身震动与厨房柜体发生的共振。这也是我家目前室内噪声的主要来源。
威乐的价格波动较大，在同事的建议下，我在闲鱼平台交易的全新设备，支持联保。威乐的安装需要另外收费，即使是天猫淘宝也是如此。
另外，在增压泵的前面，我增加了前置过滤，主要可以起到去除入户自来水中，较大的金属碎屑等颗粒物，延长各用水终端设备的使用寿命。需要特别注意，…</span>

我的上篇文章《在iPhone、Apple Watch上如何优雅地出示随申码？》上写到使用Wallet刷离线“随申码”，但是由于政府部门的一些限制，使用离线“随申码”在“电子哨兵”上是不可用的，不过可以在大部分商超、小商家以及部分政府机构，工作人员都可以使用手中的扫描仪或者手机核验离线“随申码”。
不过Wallet它诞生之初就是一步步取代人们厚重的实体钱包，那这篇文章教你怎么使用Pass2U和MakePass制作出它理想的样子。
这篇文章较长，假如没有耐心全部读完，可以依据右侧的书签栏快速跳转。

Pass2U
Pass2U是一家台湾地区的公司做出的软件服务，它主营业务是面向小微商家、企业制作、发放会员卡、集点卡等会员管理服务。其服务在有着完整Google服务的国家与地区，可以在iOS、Android上无需下载额外软件即可无感分发会员卡。此外，Pass2U也在App Store提供了面向个人用户的Wallet凭证制作App，免费版可以使用其中有限的功能，在港区商店花费HKD $15即可解锁专业版。在此部分内我会分别介绍App内制作与网页端制作的各个步骤与注意事项。
  
App内制作
步骤一：扫描、输入条码
步骤二：选择条码类型
步骤三：页面设计

票卡种类
登机牌、船票、车票.etc
折扣券
活动票卡（电影票、演唱会门票等）
商店卡（会员卡等）
通用票卡（可制作成门禁卡等）

信息填入
固定文字：如标题、个人姓名、座位号等
时间：填入后会根据系统时间自动将过期票卡失效
地点：填入后会根据地点通过Siri建议推送票卡提醒

选色
这个就依照个人审美自由发挥啦。
注：Pass2U选色系统使用Adobe RGB，请在测色软件上选择“以Adobe RGB显示”

网页端制作

注：网页端制作需要注册Pass2U账号，在登录页面的“票卡發行人員”处登陆

步骤一：点击“建立新樣…</span>

                              <span>Murena 是一个与 e 基金会有关的新品牌，该品牌专注于提供隐私友好的 /e/OS 及新的智能手机和云服务。




/e/OS 是一个流行的、注重隐私的移动操作系统，是谷歌安卓的替代品之一。

这个复刻自 Lineage OS 的操作系统消除了任何与谷歌有关的依赖性，并鼓励你在使用中不要直接依赖任何谷歌的服务。

取而代之的是，它提供一些解决方案作为替代品，为你提供一个隐私友好的生态系统。

为了精简其产品，负责该操作系统的 e 基金会宣布了一个新的品牌 “Murena”，其中包括了一些以该操作系统为核心的新功能和一个新的智能手机。

Murena 和 e 基金会

e 基金会作为一个致力于 /e/OS 的非营利组织将继续存在。因此，可以说这不是一次品牌重塑。

然而，Murena 作为一个新的创业公司，似乎是一个独立的商业实体，将专注于鼓励主流用户尝试 /e/OS，并促进支持该操作系统的智能手机的使用。

对该公司，/e/OS 的创建者提及：



/e/OS 1.0 有什么新内容？

随着该操作系统的最新升级发布，他们的目标是让事情变得更容易理解，在提高使用便利性的同时，仍然考虑到隐私。

此外，还随同本次更新推出了新的应用程序商店（App Lounge）和新的隐私工具（Advanced Privacy）。

App Lounge：这个新的应用程序安装程序可以让你安装许多开源应用程序和 PWA（渐进式网页应用Progress Web App）。在你安装之前，它还会告知你每个应用程序中已有的跟踪器。



我相信一个量身定做的应用商店的存在将有助于消除新用户是否应该尝试用 /e/OS 安装 Play Store 或 F-Droid 的困惑。

除此之外，Advanced Privacy 工具将有助于限制用户在安装第三方应用程序后暴露的数据。

如果你想远离科技巨头，你还会发现 Murena 云服务可以用作私人电子邮件账户服务和云存储。该电子邮件服务提供的功能可以隐藏你的原始电子邮件地址。

Murena One



首款 Murena 品牌的智能手机将于 6 月下旬推出，并将向美国、加拿大、欧洲、英国和瑞士等地的用户发货。

这款智能手机将采用 6.5 英寸显示屏，配备 2500 万像素的前置摄像头，后置摄像头设置有三个传感器，分别是 4800 万像素、800 万像素和 500 万像素。

我们不太确定是什么处理器，但它提到了是一个八核芯片，加上 4GB 的内存。所有这些都由 4500 毫安时的电池供电。

除了它的第一款智能手机，你还可以从它的官方网站上购买 Fairphone 和 Teracube 的智能手机，这些手机预装了 /e/OS。

总结

你可以在其官方网站上了解更多关于新的 /e/OS 升级、云服务和可用的智能手机的信息。


Murena


该智能手机的定价还没有在新闻发布会上披露。所以，我们建议你如果有兴趣，可以关注一下。

                              <span>了解使用数组和切片在 Go 中存储数据的优缺点，以及为什么其中一个更好。


在本系列的第四篇文章中，我将解释 Go 数组和切片，包括如何使用它们，以及为什么你通常要选择其中一个而不是另一个。

数组

数组是编程语言中最流行的数据结构之一，主要原因有两个：一是简单易懂，二是可以存储许多不同类型的数据。

你可以声明一个名为 anArray 的 Go 数组，该数组存储四个整数，如下所示：

anArray :&#x3D; [4]int{-1, 2, 0, -4}


数组的大小应该在它的类型之前声明，而类型应该在声明元素之前定义。len() 函数可以帮助你得到任何数组的长度。上面数组的大小是 4。

如果你熟悉其他编程语言，你可能会尝试使用 for 循环来遍历数组。Go 当然也支持 for 循环，不过，正如你将在下面看到的，Go 的 range 关键字可以让你更优雅地遍历数组或切片。

最后，你也可以定义一个二维数组，如下：

twoD :&#x3D; [3][3]int{
  {1, 2, 3},
  {6, 7, 8},
  {10, 11, 12}}


arrays.go 源文件中包含了 Go 数组的示例代码。其中最重要的部分是：

for i :&#x3D; 0; i &lt; len(twoD); i++ {
  k :&#x3D; twoD
  for j :&#x3D; 0; j &lt; len(k); j++ {
    fmt.Print(k[j], &quot; &quot;)
  }
  fmt.Println()
}

for _, a :&#x3D; range twoD {
  for _, j :&#x3D; range a {
    fmt.Print(j, &quot; &quot;)
  }
  fmt.Println()
}


通过上述代码，我们知道了如何使用 for 循环和 rang…</span>

                              <span>为纪念全球无障碍意识日，让我们了解一下 NVDA 开源屏幕阅读器，以及你该如何参与其中，为所有网络用户提高无障碍性。


屏幕阅读器是辅助技术软件的一个专门领域，它可以阅读并说出计算机屏幕上的内容。完全没有视力的人只是视力障碍者的一小部分，屏幕阅读器软件可以帮助所有群体。屏幕阅读器大多特定于操作系统，供有视觉障碍的人和无障碍培训师使用，以及想要测试网站或应用的无障碍访问程度的开发人员和无障碍顾问。

如何使用 NVDA 屏幕阅读器

WebAIM 屏幕阅读器用户调查 始于 2009 年，一直持续到 2021 年。在第一次调查中，最常用的屏幕阅读器是 JAWS，占 74%。它是微软 Windows 的商业产品，并且是长期的市场领导者。NVDA 当时是一个相对较新的 Windows 开源屏幕阅读器，仅占 8%。快进到 2021 年，JAWS 占 53.7%，NVDA 占 30.7%。

你可以从 NVAccess 网站 下载最新版本的 NVDA。为什么我要使用 NVDA 并将它推荐给我使用微软 Windows 的客户？嗯，它是开源的、速度快、功能强大、易于安装、支持多种语言、可以作为便携式应用运行、拥有庞大的用户群，并且有定期发布新版本的周期。

NVDA 已被翻译成 55 种语言，并在 175 个不同的国家/地区使用。还有一个活跃的开发者社区，拥有自己的 社区插件网站。你选择安装的任何附加组件都将取决于你的需求，并且有很多可供选择，包括常见视频会议平台的扩展。

与所有屏幕阅读器一样，NVDA 有很多组合键需要学习。熟练使用任何屏幕阅读器都需要培训和练习。



向熟悉计算机和会使用键盘的人教授 NVDA 并不太难。向一个完全初学者教授基本的计算机技能（没有鼠标、触摸板和键盘技能）和使用 NVDA 是一个更大的挑战。个人的学习方式和偏好不同。此外，如果人们只想浏览网页和使用电子邮件，他们可能不需要学习如何做所有事情。NVDA 教程和资源的一个很好的链接来源是 无障碍中心。

当你掌握了使用键盘命令操作 NVDA，它就会变得更容易，但是还有一个菜单驱动的系统可以完成许多配置任务。



测试无障碍性

多年来，屏幕阅读器用户无法访问某些网站一直是个问题，尽管美国残疾人法案（ADA）等残疾人平等立法仍然存在。NVDA 在有视力的社区中的一个很好的用途是用于网站无障碍性测试。NVDA 可以免费下载，并且通过运行便携式版本，网站开发人员甚至不需要安装它。运行 NVDA，关闭显示器或闭上眼睛，看看你在浏览网站或应用时的表现如何。

NVDA 也可用于测试（通常被忽略的）正确 标记 PDF 文档以实现无障碍性 任务。

有几个指南专注于使用 NVDA 进行无障碍性测试。我可以推荐 使用 NVDA 测试网页 和使用 NVDA 评估 Web 无障碍性。

Modern applications require complicated interactions between long-running business processes, internal services, and third-party APIs. To say it&#x27;s been a challenge for developers is putting it mildly. Managing these processes means tracking complex states, preparing responses to asynchronous events, and communicating with often unreliable external dependencies.
Developers typically take on these complex challenges with solutions that are just as convoluted, assembling unwieldy systems that leverage stateless services, databases, retry algorithms, and job scheduling queues. Because these complex systems obscure their own business logic, availa…</span>

Information about Linux and open source abounds on the internet, but when you&#x27;re entrenched in your work there&#x27;s often a need for quick documentation. Since the early days of Unix, well before Linux even existed, there&#x27;s been the man (short for &quot;manual&quot;) and info commands, both of which display official project documentation about commands, configuration files, system calls, and more.
There&#x27;s a debate over whether man and info pages are meant as helpful reminders for users who already know how to use a tool, or an intro for first time users. Either way, both man and info pages describe tools and how to use them, and rarely address specific tasks and how to accomplish th…</span>

                              <span>许久没有做混淆相关的工作, 以前存储的知识遗忘得差不多了。停留在很多人的记忆里面混淆还不简单吗？不就是 -keep。这样说也没错，但是要把混淆做得精细精准还是不简单的，今天就一文带你全而透。
混淆的作用
我们为什么要做这个工作，有什么好处？
代码缩减（摇树优化）：使用静态代码分析来查找和删除无法访问的代码和未实例化的类型，对规避 64k 引用限制非常有用；
资源缩减：移除不使用的资源，包括应用库依赖项中不使用的资源。
混淆代码：缩短类和成员的名称，从而减小 DEX 文件的大小，增加反编译成本。
优化代码：检查并重写代码，选择性内联，移除未使用的参数和类合并来优化代码大小。
减少调试信息 : 规范化调试信息并压缩行号信息。
混淆的情况
混淆的情况是指你接手混淆时候的状况，大致分两种。
一种是项目刚刚立项，这个时候你跟进混淆，随着你的代码量增多，和引入的第三方库&amp;SDK 增多逐渐增加混淆规则，这是一个应该有的良性的状态，做到精准混淆也容易。
第二种情况是以前的维护者完全没有混淆，有海量的代码和第三方库，里面的反射注解和各种存在混淆风险的问题存在，这样想做到精准混淆并不容易
上文多次提到精准混淆，我理解的精准混淆是最细粒度的白名单，而不是如下反例：
-keep public class * extends java.lang.Object{*;}

混淆基础知识储备
开启和关闭混淆
开启混淆比较简单，一般来讲为了方便开发调试只混淆 release 版本：
buildTypes {
    release {
        shrinkResources true //开启资源压缩
        minifyEnabled true //开启混淆
        zipAlignEnabled true //k对齐

1. 本文目标
今天来看一下角色如何发射子弹，这里把 子弹 作为 发射物 的统称。少数人不要杠，明明是弓箭，非说是子弹。关于子弹，有些注意点，首先它是基于某个角色进行产出的；其次，它会被频繁创建和销毁。它被销毁的时机包括：命中物体时，移出屏幕，或者超出射程，又或者固定在诞生几秒后自动移除等。

这里使用射程来对子弹进行移除，对水平发射而言，射程就是子弹在水平方向上的偏移距离，如下图蓝框所示区域：

你好，我是朱涛。这是「沉思录」的第三篇文章。
今天我们来扒一下 Baseline Profiles 的底层原理。

正文
今年 Google I/O 大会上，Android 官方强推了一把 Baseline Profile，不仅在 Android、Jetpack 的主题演讲里有提到了它，就连 Jetpack Compose、Android Studio 相关的主题里也有它的身影。

第一眼，我就被它给惊艳到了！动辄 30%、40% 的启动优化成绩，还是一个通用的解决方案，真的很牛逼了！而且 App 越复杂，提升明显！说实话，刚开始我甚至有点不太相信。
国内能用吗？
在官方介绍 Baseline Profile 的时候，放了一张这样的图，貌似 Google Play Service 在中间扮演着重要的角色。

Google Play？？我心里顿时就凉了半截。完了！这么牛逼的东西，国内不能用吗？ 吓得我赶紧找来了文档，仔细看了一遍 Baseline Profile 的用法以及原理，这才放下心来：
国内能用 Baseline Profiles，只是 Cloud Profiles 不可用而已。
为了保险起见，我也在 Twitter 上找了 Google 工程师，对方也证实了我的想法。

那就没毛病了！学起来！
底层原理
其实吧，Baseline Profile 并不是一个新的东西。而且它也不是一个 Jetpack Library，它只是存在于 Android 系统的一个文件。
这里，我们要从 Android 系统的发展说起。
对于 Android 5.0、6.0 系统来说，我们的代码会在安装期间进行全量 AOT 编译。虽然 AOT 的性能更高，但它会带来额外的问题：应用安装时间大…</span>

前言
应用安装包的体积会显著影响应用的下载速度和安装速度，按照 Google 的经验数据，包体积每增加 1M 会造成 0.17%的新增折损。抖音的一些实验也证明了包体积会显著影响下载激活的转化率。
Android 的安装包是 APK 格式的，在抖音的安装包中 DEX 的体积占比达到了 40%以上，所以针对 DEX 的体积优化是一种行之有效的包体积优化手段。
DEX 本质上是由 Java/Kotlin 代码编译而成的字节码，因此，针对字节码进行业务无感的通用优化成为我们的一个探索方向。
优化结果
终端基础技术团队和抖音基础技术团队在过去的一年里，利用 ReDex 在抖音包体积优化方面取得了一些明显的收益，这些优化也被同步到了其他各大 App 上。
在抖音、头条和其他应用上，我们的优化对 APK 体积的缩减普遍达到了 4%以上，对 DEX 体积的缩减则可以达到 8% ~ 10%
优化思路
在 android 应用的构建过程中，Java/Kotlin 代码会先被编译成 Class 字节码，在这个阶段 gradle 提供了 Transformer 可以进行字节码的自定义处理，很多插件都是在这个阶段处理字节码的。然后，Class 文件经过 dexBuilder/mergeDex 等任务的处理会生成 DEX 文件，并最终被打进安装包中。整个过程如下所示：

所以，针对字节码的优化是有 2 个时机可以进行的:
在 transformer 阶段对 Class 字节码进行优化
在 DEX 阶段对 DEX 文件进行优化
显然，对 DEX 进行优化是更理想的一种方式，因为在 DEX 文件中，除了字节码指令外，还存在跨 DEX 引用、字符串池这样的结构，针对这些 DEX 格式的优化是无法在 transformer 阶段进行的。

前言
大家好，上次画了一个会说话的粽子使用了讯飞语音技术，那么今天这篇文章就带你解析如何在Flutter跨平台中让粽子开口说话，无需集成任何SDK，从而非常轻量级的实现给你的应用装上嘴巴的功能。
创建应用
首先我们需要到讯飞注册账号登录点击控制台创建一个应用，填写应用所属信息即可，非常简单。

以我这里创建了一个Flutter_Demo应用为例，点击语音合成之后，我们会得到右边一共三个参数和API调用接口，这些参数在以后生成鉴权参数以及合成语音的时候会用到。

到这里，应用就创建完成并且得到了专属的参数，是不是很简单。
创建webSocket连接
创建完应用之后，我们查看文档，因为demo是没有dart语言版本的，所以我们需要跟着文档步骤一步一步实现，我们可以看到主要是接口加密鉴权签名这里是比较麻烦的，其他符合要求即可。

鉴权规则：查看文档可以看到，我们需要在API接口后面拼接这仨参数，前两个都好说，第三个就是通过hmac-sha256规则加密在进行base64编码一系列骚操作得出，反正就是为了接口的安全，有兴趣的小伙伴可以到官网了解。

使用dart语言，那么这里加密鉴权我们需要引入以下两个插件辅助：
# 格式时间戳
intl: ^0.17.0
# 加密
crypto: ^3.0.2

鉴权核心代码：
///获取鉴权地址
String getAuthUrl(String host, String apiKey, String apiSecret) {
  final DateFormat df &#x3D; DateFormat(&quot;EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss &#x27;GMT&#x27;&quot;);
  String date &#x3D; df.format(DateTime.now());

When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. 
Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.
Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the...

A good gaming headset is practically a necessity these days. Clean and precise audio is essential for competitive gaming, allowing you not just to pinpoint your enemies but to communicate effectively with your teammates. Moreover, recent developments in spatial audio and virtual surround sound have allowed headsets to meet — and occasionally surpass — more expensive audio setups, allowing even the most budget-conscious gamer to obtain a competitive edge at a fraction of the price.
While you could always invest in a massive pair of speakers, they’re likely to earn you the dubious distinction of the worst roommate of the decade. Thankfully, the right headset will allow you to keep the running and gunning to yourself, which is why we’ve...

Sheryl Sandberg will step down as the COO of Meta Platforms after 14 years as its second-ranking executive, where she helped scale Facebook into the social media juggernaut it is today. Sandberg will leave her post as the company’s No. 2 leader in the fall after spending the next few months working with founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to transition her direct reports. She will retain a seat on Meta’s board.
Zuckerberg called the change an “end of an era” and said that he doesn’t plan to replace Sandberg’s exact role in the company’s structure. His current chief growth officer Javier Olivan, already one of the company’s most powerful but lesser-known executives, will take over as COO in what Zuckerberg says is a “more traditional” COO...

Today, NASA announced that two private companies — Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace — will develop the next-generation spacesuits that future astronauts will wear to conduct spacewalks and eventually traverse the surface of the Moon. It’s a bold new direction for spacesuit development at NASA, with the agency handing the job over to the private sector after years of struggling to develop a new suit of its own.
These new spacesuits will play a critical role in NASA’s Artemis program, the agency’s flagship initiative to send humans back to the lunar surface. Currently, NASA is aiming to land the first Artemis astronauts on the Moon by 2025 — a one-year delay from the 2024 deadline originally set by the Trump administration. When the...

Over the last day or two, there have been a growing number of reports by people who own certain Canon Pixma printers that the devices either won’t turn on at all or, once turned on, get stuck in a reboot loop, cycling on and off as long as they’re plugged in. Verge reader Jamie pointed us to posts on Reddit about the problem and Canon’s own support forum, citing problems with models including the MX490, MX492, MB2010, and MG7520.
Some believe their problem is due to a software update Canon pushed to the printers, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet. In response to an inquiry from The Verge, corporate communications senior director and general manager Christine Sedlacek said, “We are currently investigating this issue and hope to bring...

Former OpenSea product manager Nathaniel Chastain has been charged with wire fraud and money laundering in connection with an insider trading scheme. Chastain was arrested Wednesday morning in New York City and is expected to be presented in court later today.
Chastain was publicly accused of insider trading in September and fired from his position at OpenSea — but today’s indictment marks the first criminal charges associated with the scheme.
45 token purchases on 11 different occasions
While employed at OpenSea, Chastain was responsible for deciding which NFT collections would be featured on OpenSea’s front page, a distinction that typically made the collections skyrocket in value. The indictment describes a pattern of 45 token...

Everyone might be talking about the recent release of Sonos voice control or the Sonos Ray, but if Sonos’ entry-level soundbar doesn’t seem like a good fit, you can currently find discounts on a range of refurbished speakers in the Sonos catalog. Some of the current deal highlights include the Sonos Arc and Sonos Roam, which are available for $719 and $139, respectively.
The Sonos Arc normally sells for $900 new, but this refurbished model is available for $719. The Arc soundbar is perfect for anyone who wants to improve their home audio setup and offers a number of quality of life features in addition to an excellent sound profile. Like other Sonos soundbars, the Arc is compatible with Apple’s AirPlay 2, supports Google Assistant and...

Activision Blizzard has confirmed Diablo Immortal won’t be launching in Belgium and the Netherlands alongside other countries on June 2nd, and has blamed the territories’ “current operating environments” for preventing the release of its new free-to-play title, Eurogamer reports. The two countries are notable for recent rulings taken against loot boxes in games, with authorities in each country arguing that they constitute a form of gambling. The cancellation was first reported by Dutch news site Tweakers.
“Diablo Immortal will not be available in Belgium or the Netherlands, and will not appear on Battle.net or the Belgian and Netherlands App or Google Play Stores,” a spokesperson for the game’s publisher told Eurogamer. “This is related...

The crux of the Volvo / Epic partnership will be the “human-machine interface” (HMI), which, in the context of vehicle ownership, is another way to describe the way car owners interact with their vehicle’s software. Volvo says that Epic will help build a platform on which the automaker’s engineers can design software that will improve the HMI while also maintaining levels of safety that Volvo has staked much of its reputation on.

Porsche is strengthening its ties with Rimac, an electric supercar company, by participating in a $500 million investment round for the Croatia-based startup. Porsche didn’t disclose the exact amount it invested in Rimac, except to say it was “eight figures.” And Porsche won’t have a controlling interest in Rimac, retaining its previously disclosed 20 percent equity stake in the company. 
Over the years, Porsche has grown closer to Rimac, buying shares in the company and setting up a joint venture to run Bugatti after Volkswagen transferred ownership to the startup. Today’s investment news is the latest indication that Porsche has a positive perception of Rimac’s future. Porsche also owns a controlling stake in Greyp, an electric...

Just in time for Global Running Day, Garmin is introducing two new running watches to its Forerunner lineup: the $349.99 Forerunner 255 and the $499.99 Forerunner 955. Both GPS watches sport multi-band GPS and new racing features, including a race widget. The Forerunner 955 will also come in a Solar version, which, as the name suggests, adds solar charging for even longer battery life.

                              <span>因为今天已经6月了，可能会有很多人问胡桃的事情（虽然这期视频和胡桃毫无关系），所以在这里统一解释一下哈：胡桃的卡牌没有现成的，所以我是联系厂家定制并且按照花切纸牌的生产标准做的。目前还处于刚做好刀模的阶段，因此我现在也无法拍摄。但既然已经答应的事情，我只要准备好了肯定会拍的，这一点大家不用担心啦，除非我退网了（doge
在此之前，我还是会正常更新其它视频的，感兴趣的话也可以多来看看呀~最后，如果你看到了这条简介，欢迎复制到评论区，让更多人看见~

                              <span>计划释放数以亿计的 IPv4 地址

上世纪 80 年代做出的将几个 IPv4 地址范围作为特殊保留的决定，导致了大量的地址资源被浪费。在亚太地区互联网运营技术会议上，Let&#x27;s Encrypt 的联合创始人 Seth 提议，如果将 240/4、0/8、127/8、225/8-232/8 等范围作为普通的单播号码资源供网络使用，将增加约 4.19 亿个 IPv4 地址。

老王点评：虽然很多地方都在往 IPv6 迁移了，但是谁会嫌 IPv4 地址多呢？另外，我觉得当年美国那些大学、机构动辄几个 A、B 类地址，是不是也该回收一下？




Safari 浏览器成为唯二用户数突破 10 亿的浏览器之一

根据一份新的报告，Safari 的市场份额为 19%，用户数首次超过 10 亿，成为第二个用户数超过 10 亿的浏览器。第一当然是 Chrome，它的用户数远多于其它浏览器，达到了 33 亿之多。而第三名则是 Edge 浏览器，用户数 2 亿。Firefox 则没有机会名列三甲。

顺便说一句，Chrome 和 Edge 都刚刚推出了 102 版，在一周后 Firefox 推出了 101 版。版本号都跑的挺快。

老王点评：虽然 Safari 也备受批评，但作为唯一一个没有在世界上最流行的移动操作系统安卓上使用、也没有在最流行的桌面操作系统 Windows 上使用的主要浏览器，这还是非常令人印象深刻的。




微软 Office 软件被发现一个已在野利用的零日漏洞

这个已经流传了一段时间的漏洞被称为 “Follina”，它使用 Office 来检索一个 HTML 文件，而该文件反过来利用微软支持诊断工具（MSDT）来运行一些代码。更糟糕的是，即使在禁用宏的情况下，它也能工作。虽然最初的攻击只在打开恶意文件的用户账户级别上运行代码，但这种访问为更多提升权限的攻击打开了大门。

                              <span>这是一篇如何从源码编译 GNOME 的快速指南，包括 Shell、mutter 和一些原生应用。


在编译之前，你需要确保一些事情，因为以下编译直接来自 Gitlab 的主分支，其中包含一些开发包。

通常，你可以选择在任何 Linux 发行版中编译。但是我建议使用 Fedora Rawhide（Fedora 的开发分支，用于将来的发布）。

另外，请勿在稳定系统中尝试此操作。因为操作可能出错，所以你可能最终得到损坏的系统。

总而言之，你需要以下内容来从源码编译 GNOME。


测试环境（虚拟机 或测试系统）。

Fedora Rawhide 发行版（推荐，从此处下载）。

确保你的发行版是最新的。

你已登录 X.org 会话。


我不建议你在 Wayland 会话中进行编译，因为你会遇到问题。

从源码编译 GNOME

GNOME 桌面是一个基于其功能的软件包集合。Linux 发行版的桌面组件工作于窗口管理器和 shell 之下。

因此，对于 GNOME，我将首先编译 mutter – 它是 GNOME Shell 的窗口管理器。然后进行 GNOME Shell 的编译。最后，我将编译一些原生应用。

我将使用 meson 构建系统进行编译。meson 是一个漂亮的构建系统，快速且用户友好。

编译 mutter

打开终端并安装 GNOME Shell 和 mutter 所需的软件包。

sudo dnf build-dep mutter gnome-shell


在主目录（或你想要的任何地方）中创建演示目录。

cd ~
mkdir demo
cd demo


从 Gitlab 克隆 mutter 的主分支。

                              <span>KVM 是 基于内核的虚拟机Kernel-based Virtual Machine 的首字母缩写，这是一项集成在内核中的开源虚拟化技术。它是一种类型一（裸机）的管理程序hypervisor，可以使内核能够作为一个裸机管理程序bare-metal hypervisor。

在 KVM 之上可以运行 Windows 和 Liunx 虚拟机。每个虚拟机都独立于其它虚拟机和底层操作系统（宿主机系统），并拥有自己的 CPU、内存、网络接口、存储设备等计算资源。

本文将介绍在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS（Jammy Jellyfish）中如何安装 KVM 。在文末，我们也将演示如何在安装 KVM 完成之后创建一台虚拟机。

1、更新 Ubuntu 22.04

在一切开始前，打开终端并通过如下命令更新本地的软件包索引：

$ sudo apt update


2、检查虚拟化是否开启

在进一步行动之前，首先需要检查你的 CPU 是否支持 KVM 虚拟化，确保你系统中有 VT-x（ vmx）英特尔处理器或 AMD-V（svm）处理器。

你可以通过运行如下命令，如果输出值大于 0，那么虚拟化被启用。否则，虚拟化被禁用，你需要启用它：

$ egrep -c &#x27;(vmx|svm)&#x27; /proc/cpuinfo




根据上方命令输出，你可以推断出虚拟化功能已经启用，因为输出结果大于 0。如果虚拟化功能没有启用，请确保在系统的 BIOS 设置中启用虚拟化功能。

另外，你可以通过如下命令判断 KVM 虚拟化是否已经在运行：

$ kvm-ok


运行该命令之前，请确保你已经安装了 cpu-checker 软件包，否则将提示未找到该命令的报错。

直接就在下面，你会得到如何解决这个问题的指示，那就是安装 cpu-checker 包。

                              <span>开源的无头Headless内容管理系统（CMS）列表中添加了一个新选项。它会是一个更好的无头 WordPress 替代品吗？




自从一年多前发布首个测试版以来，作为无头内容管理系统（CMS），Payload 已经逐渐在 Web 开发社区中给人们留下了深刻印象。先做一些背景介绍，Payload 是专门为更简单地开发网站、Web 应用或原生native应用而量身定制的内容管理系统。

最近，他们决定完全开源，现在，它已跻身 可用的最佳开源内容管理系统 之一。

然而，这也带来了一些问题：他们会采用怎么样的商业模式？Payload 内容管理系统的计划是什么？下面，就让我们简要地看一下吧！

Payload 为什么要开源？

自 2021 年首次发布以来，Payload 已经收到了来自开源社区的许多贡献。正如 Payload 在他们 最近的公告 中所说，开源是一个重要的决定，它能够使项目能够达到的更高的高度，这是闭门造车做不到的。



此外，这种开放性通常会增加开发者社区的信任。这种信任也会延伸到商业，自然而然地转而成为开发者最支持、最信任的平台。

因此，Payload 正在切换到 MIT 许可证。这将允许任何人免费且不受限制地修改、分发和使用 Payload。

然而，Payload 仍然需要资金流入才能持续运营。那么，这就引出了一个问题，Payload 将如何盈利呢？

Payload 将如何盈利?

与往常一样，Payload 需要一些财务支持才能维持运营。团队拿出了一个由两部分组成的计划，该计划既要为用户提供更多 以便利为中心convenience-focused的功能，又要为 自托管self-hosted 客户提供难以置信的灵活性。



企业许可证

此选项与其他开源 CMS 的软件服务极为相似。这些许可证将提供更高级的 SSO 选项，并为开发者保证 Payload 核心团队的响应时间。

这些许可证应该对大公司有吸引力，尤其是那些需要最大程度可靠性的公司。

云主机

这个选项非常有吸引力，因为它结合了多种服务来创造最方便的体验。尽管传统托管仍然相当容易，但只要你为 Node 应用程序添加数据库、持久文件存储和其他基础设施，你就会面对四五个不同的服务，而这些服务都需要无缝协同工作。

应该注意的是，这不是必需的，Payload 仍然鼓励用户托管他们的实例。这项服务只是消除了与托管相关的大量费用和挑战而已。

截至目前，事情还没有敲定。但是，你可以关注 GitHub 上的讨论来跟踪事情的进展。

总结

作为一个新兴的 CMS 选项，很高兴看到 Payload 迈出了这一步，成为 WordPress 和其他选项的流行替代品。此外，在我看来，Payload 团队对他们的新业务模式充满信心，或许这预示着一个光明的未来（希望如此）。

Start YugabyteDB with TEST_docdb_log_write_batches set to true, which is described as: Dump write batches being written to RocksDB (For testing only!)
docker run -d --name yb -p7000:7000 -p9000:9000 -p5433:5433 \

Create a test table:
docker exec -it yb ysqlsh -e -h localhost -c &quot;
create table demo (k text primary key, v text);

Log all what happens on this table tablets:

It is currently being used by small and large corporations for websites such as YouTube, Spotify, Instagram, Disqus, and Dropbox and demand for Django developers is increasing.
By following this guide you will learn how to properly set up a Django project with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite to start developing modern web applications even faster.
Tailwind CSS is one of the most popular CSS frameworks based on the utility-first approach and it helps you build user interfaces even faster without ever leaving your HTML.

Because when I work with developers, the first thing I realize is how underpaid they are. 
The average JavaScript developer I talk to is around 30% underpaid. That’s because there is one giant problem with everything you heard about making more money as a developer.
Everyone recommends things likes:
Selling your soul on Upwork chasing low-paid projects competing with hundreds of people for the same gig. Not my cup of tea!
Wasting hundreds of hours as an “indie hacker” building an app that will die forgotten in another GitHub repo. The building is the easy part. Getting users is the hard part.
Even building a YouTube channel with the same 5 step JavaScript tutorials as every “Influencer” out there making 2 cents per hour… Actually,…</span>

You could’ve been a hacker if you tinkered with hardware. If you found new ways to perform art, you could also be a hacker. It’s all about the mindset and not about the tools.
The core concept of this culture was in trying and failing and trying again — while sharing the knowledge with your fellow hackers so they can build upon your mistakes.
Nowadays, the word “hacker” is used negatively, portrayed by the media as villains who rob banks and spread ransomware. In this artic…</span>

One minute you feel like a god after solving a stupid type error the next you feel like a total idiot after not being able to solve a failed unit test caused by a typo. 24/7 you&#x27;re a constant victim of the Dunning–Kruger effect.
It&#x27;s really hard to understand how much you know about a subject. I&#x27;ve doubted myself countless times and was scared if I could even survive as a software engineer. But we always get by. Thats just the nature of learning and staying relevant in this industry. The key is to be humble but never doubt yourself. Keep on learning and never bottle up your problems. Ask someone about the problem you have and constantly ask for feedback, it will substantially help you grow.

在一个相对时间范围内，“正确的产品之路”是客观存在的，它就在那个地方，不以人的意志为转移。
所以企业竞争的其实是“谁可以更快更有效率的寻找到它”。
《之前 28 岁就退休的郭宇》
互联网上已经有相当多的 DAO ，但大部分 DAO 似乎并不依赖于他们的基础合约而运行，换句话说，许多 DAO 采用广泛的人治，而有限地依赖合约治理。这些治理的目的都相当宏观，譬如，是否允许使用 DAO 金库的一些钱来完成一笔投资，或者是制定一个复杂的 Roadmap ，由于目的过于宏观，这些治理大部分使用 snapshot 的链下投票来完成，它有点像我们熟悉的代议制民主：可以参与投票，但没有人能保证提案目的是否会得到完整执行。
这样的组织与 DAO 最吸引我的特点相悖。关于这种现状，存在许多解释，譬如链上治理极其昂贵，大部分用户也无法理解议题将如何被自动执行（他们甚至不会打开提案的日志查阅交易参数）

Utopia ，他们发现绝大部分 DAO 的财务还是跑在 google sheet 上。（太真实了，我参与的 DAO 现在做预算 P&amp;L 都还是在用 google sheet ，发钱就是手动操作钱包) 所以他们构建了现在的支付系统。

前段时间在想，目前 DAO 合约使用率不高（多数更像换个生产工具 Discord 的群），
程序员参与度不够？


扩展阅读（读书笔记）：
硅谷一贯最成功的那类人，要么是风险投资者（因为他们是多元的，控制着曾经稀缺的资源），要么是非常擅长识别刚刚达到产品 /市场匹配度的公司的人。这些人拥有那些公司真正想帮他们扩大规模的背景、专业知识和引荐人。然后，他们就会进入最新的 Dropbox 或最新的 Airbnb 。
那时在谷歌的人，在 Facebook 一百人的时候加入 Facebook ，然后在 Strpe 一百人的时候又加入 Strpe ？
当扎克伯格刚开始扩大公司规模的时候，惊慌失措，他说：“我不知道该怎么办。”他打电话给 Jim Breyer （风险投资者和 Accel Partners 的创始人）。Jim Breyer 说，“好办，我在另一家有一位非常出色的产品负责人，你需要这个人。”那些人往往做得最好，经过了长期的风险调整，而不是风险投资者自身。
在硅谷看到一些最成功的人，在他们的职业生涯早期就有了突破。他们被提拔成副总裁、总监或 CEO,或是很早就开了一家业绩不错的公司。如果你没有被逐级提拨，在以后要想追上就更难了。早点进小公司是好事，因为没有那么多阻止晋升的硬性条件。 
对处于职业生涯早期（甚至可以是后期）的人来说，一个公司最重要的一件事是你要建立的校友圈。想想你将和谁一起工作，以及这些人将会去做什么。

公司广州分部在磨碟沙，未来也可能跳槽。
需求：小 3 房、通勤全程 1 小时内、不要太吵。
选项：
1 、番禺的品秀星瀚， 南向望花园的 89 平不会太受噪音影响。 近 22 号线，未来还有 3 条高速，通勤在预期内。4300 户的社区，基础商业水平应该可以满足。 小区内有 9 年制学校也省心。
2 、横沥近地铁盘， 靠 18 号线也能勉强满足通勤，1 公里内中大的医院，学校大概率也能兑现。只是目前都没人口，怕以后发展不起来的话，吃饭买菜都麻烦。   但规划很强，要能发展起来，涨幅空间还是有的。（星瀚肉眼目测没啥涨幅空间了）

然后才知道这叫空心砖，真是巧了，就 2.2 面墙不是混凝土的，这一面正好是放电视的。另外 1.2 面都在卧室。
挂架那边说空心砖不能挂，瓦工吞吞吐吐，表示自己不接这活。
网上查了一下有在里面展开的膨胀螺丝，不知道靠不靠谱。还有灌浆和加楔子的（瓦工不接，自己搞吧）。

打空心砖专用膨胀螺栓，应该最省时省力了。不知道靠不靠谱

我在 nestjs 中使用了 postcss-nesting 来支持 css 嵌套使用（不要问为什么不用 sass ），嵌套使用都没什么问题，但是当我想使用全局作用域声明一个全局规则时，报错了。
代码如下
.a {
font-size: 12px;
    :global {
    .xxxx {
        font-size: 14px;
        }
    }
    &amp; :global(.xxxx) {
    font-size: 14px;
    }
    &amp;:global {
    .xxxx {
        font-size: 14px;
        }
    }
}

前面带上 &amp; 不报错，但是也不生效。
配置如下
{
&quot;plugins&quot;: [
&quot;postcss-flexbugs-fixes&quot;,
[
&quot;postcss-preset-env&quot;,
{
&quot;autoprefixer&quot;: {
&quot;flexbox&quot;: &quot;no-2009&quot;
},
&quot;stage&quot;: 3,
&quot;features&quot;: {
&quot;custom-properties&quot;: false
}
}
],
&quot;postcss-nesting&quot;
]
}

有没有人遇到或者使用过类似的能帮我解答一下。谢谢</span>

主机设备：NUC11PAHi5

具体表现就是:
Intel NUC 画面转圈圈（几十秒），
黑屏（几十秒到几分钟，有时候有鼠标指针，有时候没有）
请稍后界面转圈圈（有时候出现，一般在安装更新重启之后）
登录界面转圈圈（几十秒）
尝试过的解决办法：
尝试进入安全模式测试（问题依旧）
通过 U 盘 重刷 BIOS
全新安装操作系统（为了验证各种可能性，重装了好几次）
手动下载安装驱动，避免安装 NUC 监控和自定义服务
断开可能引起问题的外设
禁用 Windows Update 更新驱动
安装一个驱动就重新启动一次
更新完系统禁用 Windows Update ，或者安装完系统就暂停（两条路都试了）
禁用 Windows Defender 、Windows Search 、SysMain 、Connected User Experiences and Telemetry 服务（发现禁不禁影响不大）
下面是刚刚全新安装的系统，在手动安装好 Intel 官方驱动、系统更新到最新版后的计算机开机的 Windows 系统事件：

请问什么尺寸的照片才适合冲洗 16：9? 那么多的照片，一张一张的裁剪又很累。两年的照片，大概有 500 张。
目前打算某宝上冲洗，需要传照片，虽然没有特别隐私的东西，但仍然担心会泄露一些隐私，有没有别的方法。

我用了这个接口：ClipboardManager.addPrimaryClipChangedListener 问题是只能监听在自己应用中复制出来的内容，无法监听应用外的复制 [实时监听] ，如从微信中复制了一块内容。
有什么办法能监听到自己应用外的复制情况呢？（不想要通过轮询去读剪贴板的内容的变化）
还是说这是系统的限制，不给监听自己应用外的复制？</span>

SwiftUI 是真香，现阶段来看除了缺乏统一的规范，一些 lazy 组件的 bug ，combine 库有些繁琐，动画系统包的有点深，gesture 兼容有点问题，navigation 自定义有点困难，不少功能需要借助 UIViewRepresentable 等外，其他的都挺好，特别是现在的动画系统跟 Hero 那转场的实现差不多，一些复杂的交互简单的令人发指。最近分析了一下 UI 设计辅助类软件的发展，主要从 Sketch 到 Figma 的变化，结合 UI 框架这种声明式的发展方向，在未来可预见的时间里 UI 开发跟 UI 设计的结合会越来越明显，未来 UI 代码量会急剧下降，而代码生成则会变的极其简单，UI 设计只需要在 Figma 这类设计辅助软件里完成 UI/UX 设计，导出的内容可能就只差业务代码了，再看看 ProtoPie 这种产品，结合 SwiftUI 现在的动画实现产出交互代码也都是几个蓝图连连看了。
感慨发完了，习惯记录软件叫「宁静清单」，去年十月份开始做的，中间来来回回花了四五个月，第一版不是很满意，又花了一个月发了 1.1.0 ，功能还有很多待完善，欢迎大家体验指正，可以加群 Q: 781744407 讨论交流。</span>

Moving from physical networks using switches, routers, and ethernet cables to virtual networks using software-defined networks (SDN) and virtual interfaces involves a slight learning curve. Of course, the principles remain the same, but there are different specifications and best practices. Kubernetes has its own set of rules, and if you&#x27;re dealing with containers and the cloud, it helps to understand how Kubernetes networking works.
The Kubernetes Network Model has a few general rules to keep in mind:
Every Pod gets its own IP address: There should be no need to create links between Pods and no need to map container ports to host ports.

I&#x27;m an ardent KDE Plasma Desktop user, but at work I happily use GNOME. Without getting into the question of which desktop I&#x27;d take to a desert island (that happens to have a power outlet), I see the merits of both desktops, and I&#x27;d rather use either of them than non-open source desktop alternatives.
I&#x27;ve tried the proprietary alternatives, and believe me, they&#x27;re not fun (it took one over a decade to get virtual workspaces, and the other still doesn&#x27;t have a screenshot function built in). And for all the collaboration that the KDE and GNOME developers do these days at conferences like GUADEC, there&#x27;s still a great philosophical divide between the two.
And you know what? That&#x27;s a …</span>

Netflix’s test to crack down on password sharing has reportedly left some users confused, according to a report from Rest of World. The streaming service started experimenting with password-sharing solutions in Peru, Chile, and Costa Rica in March, prompting subscribers in these markets to pay an additional fee to enable streaming for others outside their household who use the same account.

The first time I started a car by pressing a button, it felt too easy and convenient — like I had somehow stumbled into a tax bracket I don’t belong in. “You’re telling me,” I thought, “that I can just leave my keys in my pocket, and the car will let me get in and drive around?” 
The push-button ignition is one of those buttons that doesn’t really add any new functionality over the thing it’s replacing (in this case, the ignition system that has you insert and turn a key). It exists solely for the sake of convenience, a job that it excels at. You get in the car, press down on the brake pedal and a button, and you’re ready to drive.

A Texas law that would have banned much social media moderation is once again on hold. In a 5-4 ruling handed down today, the Supreme Court vacated an earlier decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, meaning that HB 20 — which forbids banning, demonetizing, or downranking Texas users’ posts based on “viewpoint” — will be blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds. A lower court had already blocked the law in 2021 before the Fifth Circuit unblocked it this May.
NetChoice and the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), who filed suit to stop HB 20, petitioned the Supreme Court for a ruling earlier this month — responding to a surprising and unexplained ruling from the Fifth Circuit. Justice Samuel...

                              <span>TikTok’s testing a “clear mode.”
    

  
Some TikTok users have started noticing a “Clear Mode” option, which lets them watch a video without the UI overlay that usually shows things like the favorite and comment buttons and other info about the video. TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s currently testing the feature, but it’s unclear how many people have access to it. 
Those that are in the test group (which includes at least two Verge staffers) can access clear mode by pressing and holding on a video, then tapping the Clear Mode button on the menu that pops up. The same method can be used to exit clear mode, and there’s also a button in the bottom right corner that will return you to the standard UI.
Activating clear mode is a two-step process....

Dell has finally revealed the $1,599.99 price attached to the UltraSharp 32-inch 4K video conferencing monitor it previewed at CES (via 9to5Mac). If that price sounds familiar, it’s because Apple’s 27-inch Studio Display costs almost the exact same amount — only Dell justifies the price with the monitor’s size and its camera sensor, while Apple’s sales pitch leans on that still-rare 5K resolution.
The Dell monitor (U3223QZ) comes with a focus on videoconferencing, made clear by Dell’s built-in UltraSharp webcam with a 4K HDR Sony Starvis sensor that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help keep you in the frame during a call. This is a bit like Apple’s Center Stage feature used in the Studio Display and other Apple devices, a similar...

Microsoft looks set to announce an updated version of its compact Surface Laptop Go, if an early retailer listing from Korea is to be believed. 
The biggest change with the Surface Laptop Go 2 appears to be its newer 11th-gen Intel CPU (an i5-1135G7), which replaces the 10th-gen model found in the original 2020 laptop. The Go 2 will ship with Windows 11 this time around, and a Google Translate of the retailer page says its webcam will have “improved HD camera performance.” Preorders are set to open on June 2nd, so an official announcement might not be far away. WinFuture previously reported that the laptop could have a starting price of $650.
Otherwise, the new laptop appears to be very similar to its predecessor. It still has a...

Euro Truck Simulator 2 has shelved an upcoming Russia-themed expansion pack after the country’s invasion of Ukraine, its developer SCS Software has announced. In a blog post, the Czech Republic-based developer said that it has cancelled the imminent release of the Heart of Russia DLC pack “so that it is not perceived in any way as being in support of or tolerance of the aggression.”
Euro Truck Simulator 2 has become a cult hit since its release in 2012, leading its developer to support it with over half a dozen major pieces of DLC in the years since. These packs have expanded the game’s map and added new countries for players to drive through. When it was officially announced in March 2021, SCS said the Heart of Russia expansion wouldn’t...

随着虚拟化技术如模拟器，容器化等技术等发展，在安卓云游戏/云手机场景中，可以在服务宿主侧虚拟出更多更小颗粒度的 Android 实例。其中比较核心的技术是图形虚拟化技术，如何最大限度利用宿主侧的 GPU 资源进行渲染和编码，不考虑软编等利用 CPU 资源进行渲染编码是因为效率带来的延迟问题。
Linux 图形栈
先看一个比较通用的 linux 图形栈：

X 协议：比较早的协议，X server 直接管理 GPU 内的 framebuffer 和 X Client 提交命令，通过 XClient（Xlib 或 XCB）向 Xserver（Xorg）提交相关命令实现，且有很多扩展协议，但是弊端需要一个额外的 Windows Manager 来处理多个应用。目前已经被 Wayland 这种扩展协议取代，composer 处理输入，窗口，合成显示等功能。
GLX：因为是用来做间接渲染，做了两个工作：1）将 OpenGL 和 X window API 绑定 2）通过 X server 转发 GL 的调用。本质还是 X 协议那一套。
FB driver：历史遗留显示子系统，提供了 Framebuffer 获取，图像操作原语，电源管理等功能。
OpenGL：统一的 3D 图形渲染 API 接口，各主流厂商（Intel、 Nvidia、AMD、Qualcomm 等）都支持的接口，主流实现的是开源的 mesa。Mesa 3D 是其最主流的开源实现，值得注意的是 Mesa 不仅支持 OpenGL，还支持 Vulkan, Direct 3D 等渲染 API。
DRM：Direct Rendering Manager, 目前主流的 GPU 显示子系统，用户态使用 libDRM 的 DRM API 来操作 DRM 设备，对 GPU 通过 ioctl 等标准文件操作来通信，实现:

1. 本文目标
之前的主角是通过键盘来控制移动，但移动设备中一般不通过键盘操作，而是点击操作。比如下面的人物在点击时，会动画移动到点击的位置，这就涉及到构件的动画移动。

2. 点触动画
这里点击时一闪的小星星，本质上是一个序列动画，如下是序列图片：

我们在 【第一篇】 就介绍了通过 SpriteAnimationComponent 构件对序列帧进行动画播放，但当时并没有细说。 类型维护的 SpriteAnimation 对象是由  Sprite 列表构成的列表，本质上就是在 update 方法中，根据时长来不断更新显示的帧索引而已。
TouchIndicator ，由外界提供 position 确定位置。在 onLoad 回调中，加载序列帧图片形成 SpriteAnimation 。注意一点，默认情况下序列帧动画是在不断运行的，可以指定 …</span>

今天分享一个简单轻松的内容： ButtonStyle  和  MaterialStateProperty 。
大家是否还记得去年 Flutter 2.0 发布的时候，除了空安全之外 ，还更新了一系列关于控件的  breaking change，其中就有  FlatButton  被标志为弃用，需要替换成 TextButton 的情况。
如今已经 Flutter 3.0 ，不大知道大家对  TextButton  是否已经足够了解，或者说对 MaterialStateProperty 是否已经足够了解？
为什么  TextButton  会和 MaterialStateProperty  扯到一起？
首先，说到 MaterialStateProperty  就不得不提 Material Design ，MaterialStateProperty  的设计理念，就是基于 Material Design 去针对全平台的交互进行兼容。

相信大家当初在从 Flutter 1 切换到 Flutter 2 的时候，应该都有过这样一个疑问：
为什么 FlatButton 和  RaisedButton  会被弃用替换成 TextButton  和  RaisedButton ？

因为以前只需要使用 textColor 、backgroundColor 等参数就可以快速设置颜色，但是现在使用  ButtonStyle  ，从代码量上看相对会麻烦不少。
当然，在后续里官方也提供了类似  styleFrom 等静态方法来简化代码，但是本质上切换到 ButtonStyle   的意义是什么 ？MaterialStateProperty 又是什么？

首先我们看看   MaterialStateProperty  ，在  MaterialStatePropert…</span>

There is more to it than that! It requires some unpacking! Before we dive into the specifics, it is probably worthwhile to understand why is a huge for-profit company giving away a high-quality product for free!

Here&#x27;s what I want to come up with, a trip report database connected to our events database, a collection mechanism as well as a standardised assessment. You can build something like that yourself. Here&#x27;s the scaffold. 
The core idea of a trip reports and why we want to collect them in a database is to 
capture the feedback while it is still fresh,
use a standardised matrix,
aggregate multiple assessments if available,
analyse and compare the data i.e. evaluate the trip,
make an educated decision for future trips.
You could just use about anything. An Excel list, Notion, SQL Server, Salesforce. Whatever.

Each tool offers several levels of support, making it complex to compare. In this article, we will focus on the ALM framework and test management functionalities of aqua and Zephyr in order to put them on the same level.

                              <span>Originally posted on the MetalBear blog.


Imagine you’re a backend developer at post series B SaaS soonicorn. You’ve spent half a sprint adding a new feature to your microservice. You’ve thoroughly researched possible inputs and database states and built an elaborate test suite. Your code was mercilessly reviewed by two of your teammates. Finally, the tests pass, the pull request is approved, and as a final verification, you deploy your new code to the staging environment…
Where it crashes almost immediately. Turns out you forgot to test some obscure configuration, or some complex database state that would only ever occur on a mature, complex environment - like staging, and unlike your local machine.
The worst part being that you know it’s going to happen again next sprint.
I’ve encountered some variation of the dev loop at every startup I’ve ever worked in, and it’s this pain exactly that we’re trying to solve with mirrord. mirrord runs in two places - on your local development machine, and in your staging environment. By wrapping your local process and hooking system calls, it lets you plug your process non-invasively into that service’s instance on the staging environment. 
 
Today we’re releasing mirrord 2.0, which supports incoming traffic. That means whatever traffic reaches your service in staging is duplicated by mirrord and sent to your local process. We’ll soon be adding support for outgoing traffic, file access, and environment variables - everything needed for your local process to “think” it’s running on the staging environment.
1. You can use it as either a CLI tool, or an extension for VS Code (IntelliJ support is on the way). Try it out here, and let us know what you think at hi@metalbear.co, or in our repo!
note that mirrord doesn’t install anything persistent in your Kubernetes cluster. It runs a job that self-deletes when mirrord terminates. ↩</span>

                              <span>With the new tool window, you can now see all work in progress across your entire team in a single view, it&#x27;s like a branch-based version of github.com/pulls but updated in real-time directly inside PhpStorm 🤯 
The tool window shows every branch ahead of the default branch for every repository in your organization, grouped by the author (the  last commit to a branch determines the author). 

You can expand a branch to see a list of the changed files and click on a file to open a diff compared to the default branch of the repository.
All this works completely offline but if you sign in, you&#x27;ll unleash the full power of the tool window! 
Sign in with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Azure DevOps (support for other services will be added soon) and you&#x27;ll switch from offline to real-time mode.

Generally I start a blog with &quot;Hello devs &quot; but today I start with &quot;Hello Readers&quot; because this blog is not technical learning. This blog is about learning which I got from book &quot;The Leader Who Had No Title&quot; - Robin Sharma. 
One year back, June 2021 due to Covid I got admitted to hospital. I was in the hospital almost 15 days and after getting discharged again 10 days only rest. In my whole life I never had such an incident where I got disconnected from study or work or passion. This is first I got disconnected almost 25 days which result to down my moral and feel like something I lose in those 25 days. I share a situation with my wife about feeling demotivated about what to do. She suggested two things to me: if you have completed 10 years in IT why not write a blog on you…</span>

I often thought about the fact that Rust can be a powerful API back-end some reasons include:
So I searched a framework to build API , I found rocket , there are a lot of tutorial about building an API with Rocket connected to a database but there are a little more complex for someone that just begin with Rust.
We are going to build a simple crypto price API. For that, we are going to use the Rocket framework, and &quot;Reqwest&quot; to send HTTP request into our back-end API. This is the following step to follow:

                              <span>It&#x27;s a casual day of coding on a project that I&#x27;ve been working on for about a month. While learning how to implement a new feature, I got an idea of how to use what I exactly learnt into a new project. 

What is it about new projects that we drop the current ones we&#x27;re working on? Why are they (generally speaking) more fun? and how do we stick to the current work before moving on to new projects? 
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this and to solve them, I reached out to my mentors, seniors and peers in my college. 
Personally, I feel that whenever I learn something new I must try and implement it somewhere to explore all sides of it. This goes on like a domino effect, one new learning, triggers another project and there&#x27;s always something new to learn in every project.

GitHub Copilot is used to write code faster and with less work. 
Individual lines and whole functions are suggested instantly by the Copilot. 
OpenAI Codex is a new artificial intelligence system.
OpenAI Codex was trained on publicly available source code and natural language so it understands both programming and human languages. 
The GitHub Copilot editor extension sends your comments and code to the service, which uses OpenAI Codex to suggest individual lines and whole functions.
GitHub Copilot has been trained on a selection of English language and source code from publicly available sources.
The code it suggests may not always work, or even make sense, as it tries to understand your intent and to generate the best code it can. 
Code suggested by GitHub Copilot should be carefully tested, reviewed, and checked out, like any other code. You are always in charge as a developer.
Change to the developer experience can be brought about by bringing in more intelligent systems. 
Existing engineers will be able to be more productive, reduce manual tasks and focus on interesting work.
GitHub Copilot has the potential to lower barriers to entry and allow more people to explore software development and join the next generation of developers.

                              <span>上古电子表格 Lotus 1-2-3 被移植到 Linux

古老的电子表格程序 Lotus-1-2-3 问世于 1983 年，那时候甚至 Linux 都没有出现，它可以说是使得 IBM PC 获得成功的唯一应用。一位爱好者成功地将该程序移植到了 Linux 上。需要强调的是，这不是一个模拟的程序，而是原始的 1990 年的 Lotus 1-2-3，它原本运行在 x86 Unix 上，现在可以原生地运行在现代 x86 Linux 上。

老王点评：真是极客的乐趣，不过，在 Linux 上试试上个世纪的字符界面的电子表格也挺有趣的。有没有用过 Lotus-1-2-3 的人？来举个手。




谷歌悄悄禁止了 Colab 上的深度伪造训练项目

谷歌的 Colab 是一个在线计算资源，允许研究人员直接通过浏览器运行 Python 代码，同时免费使用包括 GPU 在内的计算资源。因而它成为训练机器学习项目（如深度伪造模型）或进行数据分析的理想选择。深度伪造可以被训练成在视频片段上替换人脸，添加逼真的面部表情，使结果看起来很真实，但是，它们的使用缺乏道德限制，一直是争议和担忧的来源。

法国禁止英语的游戏术语以保护语言的纯洁性

法国官员正在继续他们长达几个世纪的战斗，以保护语言的纯洁性，全面修改了关于使用英语电子游戏术语的规则。法国文化部说，电子游戏领域充斥着英语，可能成为非游戏玩家的“理解障碍”。新规则规定，政府官员必须用经批准的法语版本取代“e-sports”和“streaming”等词汇。有着数百年历史的语言监管机构法国学院在 2 月份曾警告称，“（语言）退化绝不能被视为不可避免”。

老王点评：法国人对自己文字和文化重视得很，这让我想起了《最后一课》，而我们的互联网上到处混杂着中文和英语。

                              <span>本文是 Go 系列的第三篇文章，我将介绍三种最流行的复制文件的方法。


本文将介绍展示如何使用 Go 编程语言 来复制文件。在 Go 中复制文件的方法有很多，我只介绍三种最常见的：使用 Go 库中的 io.Copy() 函数调用、一次读取输入文件并将其写入另一个文件，以及使用缓冲区一块块地复制文件。

方法一：使用 io.Copy()

第一种方法就是使用 Go 标准库的 io.Copy() 函数。你可以在 copy() 函数的代码中找到它的实现逻辑，如下所示：

func copy(src, dst string) (int64, error) {
  sourceFileStat, err :&#x3D; os.Stat(src)
  if err !&#x3D; nil {
    return 0, err
  }

  if !sourceFileStat.Mode().IsRegular() {
    return 0, fmt.Errorf(&quot;%s is not a regular file&quot;, src)
  }

  source, err :&#x3D; os.Open(src)
  if err !&#x3D; nil {
    return 0, err
  }
  defer source.Close()

  destination, err :&#x3D; os.Create(dst)
  if err !&#x3D; nil {
    return 0, err
  }
  defer destination.Close()
  nBytes, err :&#x3D; io.Copy(destination, source)
    return nBytes, err
  }


首先，上述代码做了两个判断，以便确定它可以被打开读取：一是判断将…</span>

                              <span>随着自动化扩展到涵盖 IT 的更多方面，越来越多的管理员正在学习自动化技能并应用它们来减轻他们的工作量。自动化可以减轻重复性任务的负担，并为基础设施增加一定程度的一致性。但是，当 IT 工作人员部署自动化时，会出现可能对大大小小的基础设施造成严重破坏的常见错误。在自动化部署中通常会出现五个常见错误。

缺乏测试

初学者常犯的错误是自动化脚本没有经过全面测试。由于拼写错误或逻辑错误，简单的 shell 脚本可能会对服务器产生不利影响。将该错误乘以基础架构中的服务器数量，你可能会遇到一大堆问题需要清理。在大规模部署之前始终测试你的自动化脚本。

意外负载

经常发生的第二个错误是没有预测脚本可能对其他资源施加的系统负载。当目标是十几个服务器时，运行从仓库下载文件或安装包的脚本可能没问题。脚本通常在成百上千台服务器上运行。这种负载可以使支持服务停止或完全崩溃。不要忘记考虑端点影响或设置合理的并发率。

离开脚本

自动化工具的一种用途是确保符合标准设置。自动化可以轻松确保组中的每台服务器都具有完全相同的设置。如果该组中的服务器需要根据该基线进行更改，同时管理员不了解合规标准，那么可能会出现问题。安装和启用不需要和不想要的服务，从而导致可能的安全问题。

缺乏文档

管理员的一项固定职责应该是记录他们的工作。由于合同到期、升职或定期员工流动，公司可能会在 IT 部门频繁招聘新员工。公司内的工作组相互隔离也很常见。由于这些原因，重要的是记录哪些自动化已经到位。与用户运行脚本不同，自动化可能会在创建它的人离开组之后继续很长时间。管理员可能会发现自己在其基础设施中面临着来自未经检查的自动化的奇怪行为。

缺乏经验

列表中的最后一个错误是管理员对他们正在自动化的系统不够了解。管理员经常被雇用到他们没有接受过足够培训且没有人可以求教的职位上工作。自 COVID 以来，当公司努力填补空缺时，这一点尤其重要。然后管理员被迫处理他们没有设置并且可能不完全理解的基础设施。这可能会导致非常低效的脚本浪费资源或配置错误的服务器。

结论

越来越多的管理员正在学习自动化来帮助他们完成日常任务。因此，自动化正被应用于更多的技术领域。希望此列表将有助于防止新用户犯这些错误，并敦促经验丰富的管理员重新评估他们的 IT 策略。自动化旨在减轻重复性任务的负担，而不是为最终用户带来更多工作。

                              <span>Plex.tv 终于增加了 Linux 桌面版本和全新的 HTPC 应用。不过，它目前只提供了 Snap 包。




Plex 是一个流行的流媒体播放器，同时，它能够用作一个媒体服务器软件。

事实上，它也是 Linux 上最好的媒体服务器软件 之一。

是的，这个媒体服务器已经支持 Linux，而且还提供了一个 包含安装步骤的教程。

Linux 上的 Plex 桌面播放器提供 Snap 包

我知道很多人都不喜欢使用 Snap 包来安装这个桌面播放器。但现在，这个桌面播放器已在 Snap 商店中提供，你可以轻松地在任何 Linux 发行版上安装它。



幸运的是，这个桌面播放器的 公告 还提到他们正在开发一个 Flatpak 包，它应该会在近期登陆 Flathub。

这样一来，借助 Flatpak 和 Snap 软件包，Plex 就可以成为在 Linux 上流式传输和组织个人媒体收藏的绝佳选择。

除了桌面应用程序，如果你利用你的 Linux 机器连接到一个大屏幕来观看所有的内容，还有一个 Plex HTPC（有计划发布 Flatpak 软件包）。



顺便说一句，HTPC 是 PMP TV（全称为 Plex Media Player TV）模式的继承者。

他们在官网上与它的 Linux 桌面应用程序一同发布了这款产品。

使用 HTPC，这个桌面应用就可以和电视共享，并支持音频直通、刷新率切换、控制器和可配置输入映射等高级功能。



因此，如果你有一个大屏幕，并且想要连接你的系统（不管是什么桌面平台）的话，你现在可以使用 HTPC 应用程序来完成。


Plex 桌面版



Plex HTPC


在 Linux 系统或联网电视上流式传输内容时，你通常会使用什么呢？你觉得 Plex 能满足你的需求吗？即然它支持 Linux 了，你会想要用它来替代当前使用的软件吗？

欢迎在评论区告诉我们你的想法！

手边主力笔记本是 ThinkPad T490 。
原本就一个本子放家里偶尔用用，挺方便。
后来，接了一个鼠标，为了操作便捷；
又接了一个外接键盘，为了打字舒服点；
然后觉得屏幕小了，通过 hdmi 接到家里的大显示器上，舒服很多；
然后再插上 3.5mm 的耳机
......
问题来了，现在的笔记本算上电源线，一个插了四五根线，有粗有细，桌面就是乱糟糟，请问，可有什么优化方案么？</span>

看了网上的教程，
1.修改 /etc/fstab ，这个方法好像只能实现固定某一个 U 盘的自动挂载。不符合任意 U 盘的需求
2.添加 udev 规则，测试不生效，df -h 查看根本没有挂载成功。规则如下：
sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usbstorage.rules
KERNEL!&#x3D;&quot;sd*&quot;, GOTO&#x3D;&quot;mnt_by_label_auto_mount_end&quot;
SUBSYSTEM!&#x3D;&quot;block&quot;,GOTO&#x3D;&quot;mnt_by_label_auto_mount_end&quot;
IMPORT{program}&#x3D;&quot;/sbin/blkid -o udev -p %N&quot;
ENV{ID_FS_TYPE}&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;&quot;, GOTO&#x3D;&quot;mnt_by_label_auto_mount_end&quot;
ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}!&#x3D;&quot;&quot;, ENV{dir_name}&#x3D;&quot;%E{ID_FS_LABEL}&quot;
ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;&quot;, ENV{dir_name}&#x3D;&quot;Untitled-%k&quot;
ACTION&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;add&quot;, ENV{mount_options}&#x3D;&quot;relatime,sync&quot;
ACTION&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;add&quot;, ENV{ID_FS_TYPE}&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;vfat&quot;, ENV{mount_options}&#x3D;&quot;iocharset&#x3D;utf8,umask&#x3D;000&quot;
ACTION&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;add&quot;, ENV{ID_FS_TYPE}&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;ntfs&quot;, ENV{mount_options}&#x3D;&quot;iocharset&#x3D;utf8,umask&#x3D;000&quot;
ACTION&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;add&quot;, RUN+&#x3D;&quot;/bin/mkdir -p /mnt/%E{dir_name}&quot;, RUN+&#x3D;&quot;/bin/mount -o $env{mount_options} /dev/%k /mnt/%E{dir_name}&quot;
ACTION&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot;remove&quot;, ENV{dir_name}!&#x3D;&quot;&quot;, RUN+&#x3D;&quot;/bin/umount -l /mnt/%E{dir_name}&quot;, RUN+&#x3D;&quot;/bin/rmdir /mnt/%E{dir_name}&quot;
LABEL&#x3D;&quot;mnt_by_label_auto_mount_end&quot;
我发现 mkdir 创建临时挂载点成功了，但是 mount 却没有成功，有点不解。请问 linux 大佬，这个怎么解决？或者有没有其它自动挂载方法，最好是经过验证可以使用的。小弟虚心请教学习。</span>

因为历史原因，已经有了一个_posts文件夹和相应的文章；
姑且用了 git 的子模块功能实现了让 hexo 直接读取；
「折腾」 Git Submodule 探究_电脑网络_沉冰浮水：
https://www.wdssmq.com/post/20100710361.html
同样因为历原因，一小部分的文章标签定义是下边这样的：
tags:
- tag1,tag2,tag3

比起修改一波就想着写个插件自动处理；
感觉上是弄出来了，但是感觉仍然不够优雅；
wdssmq/hexo-split-tags: Separate tags with commas.：
https://github.com/wdssmq/hexo-split-tags
实际是额外读取了文章处理了一遍，加上原有的流程就会一篇文章编译两次，所以又加了一步通过标记把默认生成的文章排除掉；
所以有没有更合适的接口直接拦截处理呢？</span>

领导非要实现这么一个需求：
需要提供一个接口，用户发送个人私钥、消息实体等一系列数据，让我使用特定算法完成签名，然后需要提供另一个接口，这个接口实现对签名的验证，然后将签名验证成功的消息发送给我的下游。
流程为：A 将数据发送给我-&gt;我完成签名-&gt;我自己调用验证接口验证该签名-&gt;将消息（不包含签名）发送给 B ，所有接口均走内网。
我这一步岂不是多余？自己签名自己验证，B 也不会去验证任何东西。还要求签名和验证分别部署，请问这样做真的有意义吗？</span>

去年跳槽写简历的时候，准备开发和上线一个简单的个人主页，聚合自己在各个平台的主页链接，从而让面试官能更好的了解自己。
后来从网上看到了 linktree ，能够很好的解决我的需求，心想开发难度也不是大，就自己前后端的全干了起来。
目前产品功能上和 linktree 有一些重合，在开发的过程中自己也有了一些新的想法，日后会做产品的差异化，除了完善基础功能外，也会致力于帮助站内用户建立个人品牌。

 要再次连接只能移除，再次让 xbox 手柄进入配对状态

按照目前税费计算器上，以及网上查阅资料显示，当前现状如下：
发 36000 年终奖，需要扣税 36000*3% &#x3D; 1080 元
发 36001 年终奖，需要扣税 36001*10% - 210 &#x3D; 3390.1

这里就就体现出，多发了一元年终奖，扣税多了两千多的问题。
但是这里的计算逻辑明显逻辑有问题，首先 36001*10% 表示使用费率为 10%。
而后面减去 210 是月薪纳税的 3%档位的速算扣除数。理论上应该乘以 12
即 3600110% -（ 21012 ） &#x3D; 1080.1 元才对</span>

我的环境是老掉牙的 1037u, 系统是 5.2.内存 4GB.这个环境从 2015 年就搞好了，没怎么动，除了换硬盘。现在家里有千兆宽带，群晖自带的 download station PT 下载只能跑到 65MB.top 看 cpu loading, 发现 download station 集成的 transmission cpu loading 在 45%-50%浮动。因为是双核的，所以这个表示其中一个核已经吃满。这个还有提升空间吗？网上有人说群晖的 download station 有问题，要更换其他客户端。是有这回事吗？如果要更换，看起来好多其他客户端可能不支持 5.2 了。
另外我在 chiphell 问过一个网友，他用的是 e3 1220L V3 ，自己装的 transmission 说能跑满千兆。我从 www.cpubenchmark.net 查看 cpu 跑分，似乎这颗 cpu 比我的 1037u 单核还差 100 多分(777 vs 914 ）难道真的是 download sation 有问题？但群晖这么大企业，集成个 transmission 都会出现这么大的性能问题吗？
顺便说一下，
１.download station 中的 BT 预览要关掉，否则会看到 ffmpeg 进程占用很多 cpu,下载更上不去.
2.配置 download_bt_cache_limit&#x3D;&quot;XX&quot;, 从默认的 32 调到 256 也没啥用</span>

When you write an application using the C programming language, your code usually has multiple source files.
Ultimately, these files must be compiled into a single executable. You can do this by creating either static or dynamic libraries (the latter are also referred to as shared libraries). These two types of libraries vary in how they are created and linked. Both have advantages and disadvantages, depending on your use case.
Dynamic linking is the most common method, especially on Linux systems. Dynamic linking keeps libraries modular, so just one library can be shared between any number of applications. Modularity also allows a share…</span>

我从未想过，在 21 世纪的第三个十年，自行车会成为北京上海人民出门的重要交通工具。作为一个日常骑车通勤者，在公交停了、地铁关了、滴滴不接单的帝都，第一次在北京宽阔的马路上看到了自行车比汽车多的神奇景象，仿佛梦回「自行车王国」。

然而这也带来了一些问题，也许是「幸存者效应」，往常骑车出门的大部分都是技术在水平线以上的骑行者，有着基本的骑行礼仪，而现在大量平时不骑车的人被迫骑车上路了，有些甚至是落地没几天的新车。于是，大街上多了许多晃晃荡荡摇摇晃晃的骑行者，有时你想外侧超车，他却突然一个左拐。再加上本就横冲直闯的快递外卖小电动在汽车少了之后更疯狂了，以往他们出于对汽车的畏惧还会稍微遵守一下交通规则，现在汽车不在，电动称大王了。越是车少的路口越是经常有电动车闯红灯，连以往安全的绿灯都不再安全了，这就很让人头疼了。
是时候祭出我的秘密武器了——佳明骑行雷达尾灯 。

装上佳明骑行尾灯后不仅有在白天也很闪亮的灯光告诉后方来车前方有人，还会依靠内置的雷达系统侦测后方来车，主动提醒我注意，简直是骑行安全保障。这其中的故事可以看《为了不成为马东没，我在自行车上装了块雷达》
 
也得益于那篇马东没的故事，我又拿到了佳明全新升级的骑行雷达尾灯 Varia RCT 715，这一次，他们在上面加了一颗摄像头。

外观升级的机身造型
Varia 715 还是佳明家族化的包装风格，配件说明书也都是熟悉的味道。而 715 本体也和 515 是一样的设计风格，黑色的机身红色的灯罩，最大的变化是原先大红灯变成了能记录下后方一切的深邃镜头。

机身很简洁…</span>

我的 MacBook Air 11&quot; 已经服役将近十年了。这个 2012 年发布的小家伙陪我走过了本科，又在接下来几年里时不时帮上我的忙，从 OS X Mountain Lion 一路更新到了 macOS Catalina，终于在 2020 年发布的 Big Sur 上被宣布了生命周期结束。

而自从它的系统停滞在 Catalina 后，我就没再怎么用过它。一方面，它的电池已经经不起折腾，早就不是那个可以随时带出门的笔记本；另一方面，自从上了 Catalina，系统的迟滞就变得极为明显，即使连着充电器使用，我也能感觉到打开或切换程序时的卡顿。
我想过把它出二手，但是机器被我磕平了一个角，机身上还贴满了各种贴纸，甚至 B 面的缓冲橡胶圈都开始老化脱落，卖不上什么价格。想过把它放在家里当家庭座机，但对于我爸妈来说，那台更快更大的老神舟显然是更好的选择——至少它也带得动更好的显示器。
这样一台老电脑还能做什么？或者说，它还能干得动什么？LinusTechTips 给了我启发，或许我也可以放弃 macOS，看看它能不能在 Linux 上重获新生。
Linux MacBook 初体验
选择 Ubuntu 并没经过什么考虑，只是因为自己在之前听得最多的就是这个名字，而且据说它对我不够 geeky 的小白来说比较友好，也允许在不完全安装系统的状态下进行尝试。在写这篇文章整理资料时才发现，Distrochooser 为我的需求更推荐的是其他发行版，后来我也进行了尝试。

                              <span>从 XP 时代开始，我幻想用语音转文字。后来，手机提前实现了这功能，电脑端的语音录入却一直没进展。
为了能在 PC 上用语音打字，我从 2013 折腾到 2022，经历了各种硬件和软件，终于找到最适合 PC 端的语音输入方案。
讯飞 + 小麦克风
2013 年，讯飞推出 PC 版输入法。我以为 PC 语音输入的时代已经来临，买了个十几块的小麦克风，尝试语音转文字。
可测试结果却让人大跌眼镜，语音识别准确率异常的低。即便我把麦放在嘴边，依然无法录清楚，超过 80% 内容识别错误。
过低的识别率，让我怀疑是麦克风的收音出了问题，要想语音打字就需要换个好点的话筒。但囊中羞涩，只能暂停尝试。
讯飞 + Blue Yeti
过了几年，经济宽裕点后，下单网红录音话筒 Blue Yeti，幻想着 4 位数的话筒能带来完美的收音识别效果。

但事实却是再度被打击。
对 Blue Yeti 的收音测试中，再次发现大量杂音，收货当天就直接退货。
十几元的麦克风和一千元的话筒收音效果差不多，语音输入的识别率也都超低。这让我猜测，语音输入识别率低与硬件无关，而是 PC 端的语音输入方案尚未成熟，是软件方面导致的问题。
就这样，我再次暂停了 PC 上的语音输入尝试。
外置声卡 + 动圈话筒
之后，用了 5 年的音箱出现问题，我升级了音响，并顺势添置了外置声卡，视听体验大幅提升。玩着玩着，突然想起我的语音输入梦，决定再尝试一次。
有了外置声卡，麦克风的选择多了许多，可以连接卡侬线接口的话筒了。
麦克风分为两类：电容麦、动圈麦。
电容麦收音好，但比较娇贵，怕潮怕摔，不能用桌面话筒架，适合用悬臂挂在空中，每次用完之后需要收起来。动圈麦的灵敏度和还原度都低于电容麦，存放和使用没什么要求，费用也会低些。
电容麦克风太麻烦，就选了简单的动圈麦 - 舒伯乐 PRO248S。
选好话筒后，又配了麦克风支架和卡侬线，…</span>

对了!
本教程中的部分做法借鉴了国外的一些方法,在b站能找到对应的方法,
我也是一个houdini学习者,有的地方讲的不清楚或者错误的,请大家在评论区积极纠正,
最后谢谢大家观看

👉实践过程
😜场景还原
线程中监测和硬件的连接，在任何断开的话需要弹出框给用户选择是否重新连接。
所以我们的思路就是不使用依托于Activity的Dialog，而是使用依托于Aplication的Dialog。

😜开始
首先是动态申请权限

  


用户不同意？那就用不了App就行了，我们一般都是如果没给权限直接退出应用。
现在哪个App不是必须要权限，看似允许用户自主同意，但哪个不是拒绝后无法使用功能。
所以不用太纠结。
接着在硬件设备断开连接的回调中处理
//设备断开连接的回调  isAutoConnectDlg是个dialog弹框
override fun onClientRemove(address: String?, alias: String?) {
    //禁止外部点击取消
    isAutoConnectDlg!!.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(false)
    isAutoConnectDlg!!.setCancelable(false)

前言
大家好，端午将至，首先提前祝掘金的小伙伴端午安康，端午作为中华民族的非常重要的传统节日，粽子那是必不可少的，但是你真的知道粽子的历史吗？ 今天跟随本篇文章用Flutter path画一个会科普节日的的粽子吧～
绘制
1、基本轮廓
首先我们需要将粽子的基本轮廓绘制出来，通过图片可以看到粽子的轮廓是一个圆圆的三角形状，
Path路径制作，这里我们可以将粽子的轮廓分为三个二级贝塞尔曲线来进行绘制，头、左右粽叶轮廓。 核心代码：

canvas.translate(size.width / 2, size.height / 2);
canvas.translate(-50, -50);
Paint paint &#x3D; Paint()
  ..style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.stroke
  ..strokeWidth &#x3D; 2
  ..color &#x3D; Colors.black
  ..isAntiAlias &#x3D; true;

Path path &#x3D; Path();
path.relativeQuadraticBezierTo(50, -80, 100, 0);
path.relativeQuadraticBezierTo(90, 130, -50, 130);
path.relativeQuadraticBezierTo(-140, 0, -50, -130);
path.close();
canvas.drawPath(path, paint);

效果图：

2、粽叶
有了基本轮廓，接下来我们需要绘制粽叶，可以看到粽叶的形状是一个不规则的形状，这里可以使用Path路径联合，两个路径生成一个新的路径，这样我们就可以得到左边粽叶的区域， 核心代码：
Path path2 &#x3D; Path();

1.  文字的价值
无论是应用也好、游戏也好，文字 和 图片 是永恒的显示主体。人类文明是依赖于文字进行传承的，文字的最大价值在于传递信息。如下是阴阳师的战斗截图，其中角色的伤害、当前的成绩、鬼火数量、是否暴击、式神存活状态等，都依赖于文字来显示，向玩家反馈交互的信息。

这里先显示在血条上显示一下血量信息，如下所示：

2. 文字构件 - TextComponent
在 Flame 中，使用 TextComponent 构件显示文字。我们知道 Flutter 的绘制中通过 TextPainter 类可以绘制文字，其实 TextComponent 构建本质上就是对 TextPainter 的一层封装而已。提供了一个 TextPaint 类进行使用。

如下是 Liveable 中的处理，只需要创建一个 TextComponent 对象，然后使用 add 方法添加即可。另外任何构件都可以通过 add(RectangleHit…</span>

一个非系统的普通应用，通过手机的“应用管理”查看应用权限信息后，发现显示未申请任何权限，但这个应用由可能也是一个高危险的应用。本文介绍安卓里3个高敏感权限，但是申请后却不会显示在应用信息里。
前言
话说某天正在上班的时候，公司里的一位老员工找到我，让我帮看一下手机，说手机可能中病毒了，老是有很多弹窗广告和多了莫名奇妙的应用。有的应用还无法卸载！
一开始听【无法卸载】，我的想法是系统应用，但是他很肯定的告诉我说是最近才安装的应用。得到肯定回复后，我悟了，一定是激活了设备管理器！！！查看后果然是激活了设备管理器，取消激活后，顺利卸载了应用。
跟他进一步了解了整个事件过程：开始是收到了包含有链接的短信（大概是和5G有关的内容），他点了短信的链接，跳转了一个页面（浏览器），下载安装了应用，打开应用后，又跳转了其他页面，反正他看不懂，点了确认...经过几天的困扰后，才找到了我。
如果你看了此篇文章，不妨也帮家里老人看看手机上有没有异常应用，及时排除，避免信息泄露。当然这里分享的是特殊的权限，通常的就是检查应用有没有非必要但申请了通话记录、定位、通讯录、短信、电话等高危权限，有就关闭权限或卸载应用。
下面进入正题
一、设备管理器 DeviceAdmin
获取权限后，可以具有以下功能：
删除所有数据
更改锁屏密码
设置密码规则
监视屏幕解锁尝试次数
锁屏：控制锁屏的方式和时间
恢复出厂设置
设置设备全局代理
设置存储设备加密
停用相机

另外：权限激活后无法卸载应用，取消激活后可卸载
未激活长按显示卸载按钮
激活后不显示卸载按钮









手机上如何查看
进入手机设置，在搜索框里搜索：设备管理

前言
2014 年 Google 发布了 Material Design（简称MD），成为了 Google 系产品统一的 UI 设计语言。时至今日 MD 已经有了两次大升级，2018年发布的  Material Theming （Material Design2，简称 M2），以及 2021年新发布的 Material You （Material Design3，简称 M3）。本文就带大家细数一下 M3 相对于 M2 的升级和变化。
配色个性化
M3 最大特色在于对个性化的注重，就如同 “You” 的命名一样。一个集中体现就是动态配色 (Dynamic Color) 。支持了 M3 的（比如搭载 Android12 的 Pixel 系列手机）设备，可以根据壁纸颜色动态改变 App 或 Widget 的主题。
通过谷歌提供的工具可以体验基于壁纸的动态配色效果：https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/#/dynamic

动态配色是建立在 ColorScheme 基础上，系统通过算法从当前壁纸中提取并更新 ColorScheme。 我们在应用中通过 duyamicColorScheme 可以观察到这种变化并自动应用。下面以 Compose-M3 代码为例：
val dynamic &#x3D; Build.VERSION.SOK_INT &gt;&#x3D; Build.VERSION_CODES.S
val colorScheme &#x3D; if (dynamic) {
    val context &#x3D; LocalContext.current

Epic Games has announced plans to host an in-person Fortnite competition in November, its first major in-person competitive Fortnite event since the Fortnite World Cup in 2019. 
The upcoming event, the FNCS Invitational 2022, will take place on November 12th and 13th at the Raleigh Convention Center in North Carolina. “We will be inviting a selection of top FNCS Duos from around the world who will have the opportunity to compete in a single lobby for a share of a $1,000,000 prize pool,” Epic wrote in a blog post bylined by “The Fortnite Team.”
However, the company stresses that player health and safety are “the number one priority for holding any in-person event” and warns that it may have the reschedule the event if “public health...

Rivian’s Charly Mwangi, its executive vice president of manufacturing engineering and a former Tesla exec, is leaving the company as part of a bigger shakeup splitting up parts of the company, according to Bloomberg. “The reorganization calls for splitting the commercial business, which includes delivery vans made for Amazon, from the retail side of the company that produces the R1T plug-in pickup truck and R1S sport-utility vehicle,” Bloomberg reports. The company’s new COO, Frank Klein, will now oversee “many” senior manufacturing and supply chain employees. The Wall Street Journal also reported on the shakeup.
The changes are happening as the company is starting to ramp up production of its in-demand R1T and R1S electric vehicles. In...

An alleged prototype of Google’s upcoming Pixel 7 smartphone has been posted on eBay, giving us our first look at the new phone in the wild months ahead of its scheduled fall release (via Android guru Mishaal Rahman).
Google just revealed the phone a few weeks ago at Google I/O, and what we can see in the prototype matches up with what Google has already shown. The distinctive camera bar is back, and this year it’s an aluminum bar with cutouts for the cameras. And the alleged prototype’s casing is a deep black that looks just like one of the colors Google showed off at I/O.

The Weather Channel is not trying to win you over by spending big on its version of House of Cards. It’s not bidding on The Office next time it comes up, nor is it interested in NFL games. “Our tentpole is Mother Nature,” says Nora Zimmett, TWC’s chief content officer. “And she’s always delivering weather.”
TWC launched a dedicated streaming service this month. It costs $2.99 a month or $29.99 a year, and it is ... well, it’s The Weather Channel. The app’s main screen is an always-on stream that replicates exactly what you’d see on cable. That, Zimmett says, is what viewers were actually looking for. “We looked at our audience and heard, ‘where can I get The Weather Channel if I don’t want to pay $200 a month for a traditional bundle?’”...

DeLorean Motor Company has revealed the first images of the Alpha 5 electric vehicle (EV), the brand’s attempt at resurrecting the DeLorean name in an all-electric form. Staying true to the classic ‘80s-era DeLorean known for its appearance in Back to the Future, the Alpha 5 comes with those iconic gull-wing doors and can reach 60mph in about 2.99 seconds (or 88mph in 4.35 seconds, if you’re curious).
Before we dive into the details, it’s worth noting the company behind the Alpha 5 isn’t actually the same one behind the original DeLorean vehicles — that company went defunct in 1982. An unrelated Texas-based company, which supplies replacement parts to the owners of vintage DeLorean vehicles, snapped up the rights to the DeLorean brand...

Google’s upcoming Pixel Tablet might support the cross-manufacturer USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) standard, allowing it to be used with a range of third party styluses, if a recently-discovered entry in the USI’s list of certified products is to be believed.

                              <span>01/ 备战618装机选购：AMD篇
618又要到来，今年相比去年最大的不同大概就是【显卡市场】。去年此时，游戏显卡价格正值高企，今年结合各种因素之下，显卡价格总算可以回归【官方指导价】，在618甚至破发都有可能，所以上半年装机刚需的用户确实可以趁618锁单装机了。
为了方便大家提前备战甚至是抄作业，我这次先整理针对【AMD】平台游戏用户的装机指南，同时会结合过去一年我众多装机案例里面热度最高的几套，来方便大家直接炒作业。

首先是关于2022年618 AMD平台装机的Q&amp;A
a.AMD平台/不同代处理器的选择
目前Zen 3和Zen 2两代架构同时在售，然后同时还有包含有无核显（比如APU）区别。
游戏/高性能需求用户建议选择锐龙5000系列，同时三级缓存大于30MB的型号~
核显需求用户，主要看处理器后缀有没有带“G”有的话，就是APU型号，目前APU型号虽然依旧是Vega GPU，不过支持视频补帧，而且很有可能是最后一代，视频用户可以研究。
另外还有“NPU”型号，你可以理解为APU去掉GPU单元型号，优势是价格。

b.AMD平台的潜在优势
众多的主板支持：包含全新及二手，愿意做功课的话，AMD平台主板丰富程度、兼容性性价比都是最高的，比如最早支持PCIe4.0。
黑苹果免驱：主要是AMD显卡优势，除了原本就支持的旧卡，新一代 RDNA2 也就是6000系列显卡，也可以免驱，这也是不少玩家会考虑的地方。
专业软件的OpenGL性能无限制：无论是最高端型号抑或最入门的型号，AMD消费级显卡驱动的OpenGL性能是没限制，这对于预算有限无法购入专业卡的用户来说就很有吸引力了，比如针对工程模型/医疗的应用设计软件（SolidWorks、CATIA、Siemens NX 、Medical、Creo（Pro/E）等）。

c.选B550还是X570?
对大部分人来说，B550…</span>

                              <span>前言
在之前的一篇《免费的个人博客系统搭建及部署解决方案（Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis）》中，我提到了自己通过 Hugo 这个静态网站生成器来真正搭建我的个人博客，并在 Hugo 开源社区中 hugo-theme-den这个主题基础上进行了一些个人定制化改造和配置，满足了自己的需求。
我的方案主要分为以下几个核心部分：

个人博客源仓库，对博客配置及所有文章 .md 源文件进行版本管理，配合 GitHub Action 进行自动化部署，自动生成静态站点推送到 GitHub Pages 博客发布仓库。
GitHub Pages 博客发布仓库，以 username.github.io 形式命名的仓库，使用 GitHub Pages 实现网站部署，可以通过域名 CNAME 解析使用自定义域名。
Hugo 主题仓库，fork 喜欢的主题，并对自己的个人定制化改造配置进行版本管理，通过 git submodule 的方式链接到个人博客源仓库。
其他组件源仓库，如 umami 网站数据统计及 Cusdis 网站评论系统等。

下文会对搭建、本地测试、自动化部署维护等过程进行详细讲解，希望对大家所有帮助。
使用 Hugo 搭建博客

Hugo 是用 Go 实现的博客工具，采用 Markdown 进行文章编辑，自动生成静态站点文件，支持丰富的主题配置，也可以通过 js 嵌入像是评论系统等插件，高度定制化。除了 Hugo 外， 还有 Gatsby、Jekyll、Hexo、Ghost 等选择，实现和使用都差不多，可以根据自己的偏好进行选择。
安装 Hugo
我使用的是 macOS，所以使用官方推荐的 homebrew 方式进行 hugo 程序的安装，其他系统也类似。
brew install hugo
完成后，使用以下命令进行验证：
hugo version

                              <span>前言
2017年的时候，我写过一篇使用Apple的Wallet应用制作快捷的微信/支付宝收款码的文章。
最近全国的核酸检测已经趋近于常态化，每次的全民核酸都需要我们出示当地「核酸检测信息登记二维码」，我平常的做法都是：将二维码截图保存到相册里面，然后将该照片加入到个人收藏，方便快速寻找。
但是，我突然联想到之前的这篇文章，那么可以换个思路，以更快更好玩的方式出示「核酸检测二维码」。
 
最终效果
iPhone 熄屏的条件下，双击 Home 键，找到对应地区的核酸检测二维码进行出示即可，就是这么快捷！

                              <span>大家好，我是一川，一位非主流的规划设计师，也是一名前书店创业者。在忙碌的主业之余，每年给自己制定阅读计划，每天尽量抽时间阅读，希望通过阅读拓宽生命体验，构建自在平衡的精神小宇宙。我一直以来的愿望都是：To Infinity and Beyond.
第一本想和大家分享的书也是我今年阅读的第一本书——《从零开始的女性主义》，这本书正好也是我今年想要进行主题阅读的其中一个领域：女性主义。

一川开始关注到上野千鹤子，是她在 2019 年东京大学开学典礼上的演讲（B 站上有翻译版），她提到了前一年曝光的东京医科大学入学考试的女性歧视和东京大学学生的性暴力事件，直指日本社会顽固不化的性别歧视，并且说出了广受好评的金句，

“女性主义绝不是女人像男人一样行动，或是弱者试图变为强者的思想。女性主义是追求弱者也能得到尊重的思想。”

后来，我看到其他博主推荐这本国内刚引进的新书，就打算买来看看，本来以为会是一本比较晦涩的学术书，但其实非常有趣。全书采用对谈的形式，对谈的双方是漫画家田房永子老师和上野千鹤子老师。
上野老师属于日本婴儿潮世代，又被叫做团块世代，即 1947-1949 年出生，青年期经历了日本经济高速增长。而田房老师属于婴儿潮次世代，又被叫做失落的一代，也就是 1971-1974 年出生，青年期经历了日本泡沫经济崩溃。上野老师的年纪与田房老师的母亲差不多大，在对谈中正好可以感受到日本女性主义发展的延续性。由于田房永子是一位漫画家，本书中还配有各种小漫画，形象地阐释了复杂的理念和女性在社会中所面临的困境，非常生动有趣。
全书共有五章，一川就挑选一些我觉得有意思的内容，分别给大家介绍一下。
回顾日本女性主义的启蒙
Chapter 1. 女性女人为何如此艰难？
在上野老师母亲那一辈的世代里，女性是不能出门工作的，出去工作、抛头露面被认为是一件丢人的事情，尤其良家女子更是大门不出、二门…</span>

systemd 带来实验性的 A/B 式镜像更新功能

ChromeOS 有两个根分区：一个使用的，一个备用的。当前运行的操作系统更新备用分区，然后你重新启动到备用分区。如果一切正常，它就会更新现在闲置的原来的分区。如果它不能完美地工作，那么你仍然有以前的版本可以使用，你可以再次重启回去。而最新发布的 Systemd 初始化系统带来了一个实验性的功能，提供了类似 ChromeOS、Fedora Silverblue 的这种 A/B 式镜像更新功能。Systemd 的创始人 Lennart Poettering 说：“让我们普及基于镜像的操作系统，现代化的安全属性围绕着不变性、安全启动、TPM2、适应性、自动更新、出厂重置、统一性而建立，由传统的发行包建立，但通过镜像部署。”


消息来源：theregister



老王点评：虽然很多人反对 systemd 的这种二进制、大一统和复杂的结构，但公平的讲，systemd 的很多理念很先进，其最新带来的这种 A/B 式更新功能也颇有价值。ChromeOS 证明了对于普通用户来说，就是让他们尽量少的接触底层细节，出现问题后整个回滚是最好的。但是，Linux 还是那个 Linux 吗？或许是我太守旧了。




勒索软件攻击让美国一个县回到纸质时代

美国新泽西州萨默塞特县上周遭到勒索软件攻击，使得该县政府各部门的电子邮件服务瘫痪，使得“无法提供大多数依赖互联网访问的服务”，诸如土地记录、生命统计和遗嘱记录等只有 1977 年以前的纸质记录可供查找。

老王点评：目前去各个公共部门办事，即便已经通过了电子审批，还是索要各种纸质文件，这样看起来也不是完全没有意义。: D</span>

                              <span>Tails 5.1 将针对“可绕过 Tor 浏览器安全措施的危险漏洞”提供关键修复。以下是它的全部内容。




Tails 是一个专注于安全的便携式 Linux 发行版，最近，它的开发团队发布了有关其当前版本的重要公告。他们警告用户在 Tails 5.0 或更早版本 上使用 Tor 浏览器时，避免输入或使用任何个人或敏感信息。

Tor 浏览器是 Tails 事实上的（默认）网页浏览器，它有助于在用户连接到互联网时，保护他们的在线身份。它主要被各种记者和活动家用来逃避审查。不过，普通用户也可以使用它。

问题说明

最近，有人发现了两个令人讨厌的漏洞，它们允许有害网站能够从其他网站窃取用户的信息。

这些都是在 Firefox 使用的 JavaScript 引擎中发现的。

但是，Tor 与此有什么关系？对于那些不知道的人来说，Tor 实际上是 Firefox 的一个复刻，因此包含许多类似的功能，如 JavaScript 引擎。

具体来说，在 Mozilla 发布的公告 中，这些漏洞已被确定为 CVE-2022-1802 和 CVE-2022-1529。

Tails 公告中也对此进行了说明：


“例如，在你访问恶意网站后，控制该网站的攻击者可能会在同一个 Tails 会话期间，访问你随后发送到其他网站的密码或其他敏感信息。”


你应该停止使用 Tail 发行版吗？

没有这个必要。

用户会很高兴地知道，这些漏洞并不影响 Tor 的连接。这意味着，如果你不交换任何敏感信息，如密码、个人信息、信息等，你可以随意地浏览互联网。

Tails 中的其他应用程序，尤其是 Thunderbird，仍然可以安全使用，因为 JavaScript 在使用时会被禁用。

此外，你也可以在 Tor 浏览器中启用最高的安全级别。这是推荐的，因为（该级别下）JavaScript 引擎会被禁用。不过，请注意，这会使网站无法正常运行。

换句话说，如果你知道自己在做什么的话，Tails 发行版仍然可以安全使用。

漏洞修复即将发布

好的消息是，Mozilla 已经在上游修补了这些错误，现在就等 Tails 团队发布修复程序了。

至于何时发布，他们是这样说的：


此漏洞将在 Tails 5.1（5 月 31 日）中修复，但我们的团队没有能力提前发布紧急版本。


因此，你最好的选择是等待下周的 Tails 5.1 发布。你可以阅读 Tails 开发团队的 官方公告 以了解更多信息。

                              <span>带你一窥生成二进制文件步骤的幕后，以便在出现一些错误时，你知道如何逐步解决问题。


C 语言广为人知，深受新老程序员的好评。使用 C 语言编写的源文件代码，使用了标准的英语术语，因而人们可以方便阅读。然而，计算机只能理解二进制代码。为将代码转换为机器语言，你需要使用一种被称为 编译器compiler 的工具。

最常见的编译器是 GCC（GNU 编译器集GNU Compiler Collection）。编译过程涉及到一系列的中间步骤及相关工具。

安装 GCC

为验证在你的系统上是否已经安装了 GCC，使用 gcc 命令：

$ gcc --version


如有必要，使用你的软件包管理器来安装 GCC。在基于 Fedora 的系统上，使用 dnf ：

$ sudo dnf install gcc libgcc


在基于 Debian 的系统上，使用 apt ：

$ sudo apt install build-essential


在安装后，如果你想查看 GCC 的安装位置，那么使用：

这里有一个简单的 C 程序，用于演示如何使用 GCC 来编译。打开你最喜欢的文本编辑器，并在其中粘贴这段代码：

// hellogcc.c
#include 

int main() {
    printf(&quot;Hello, GCC!\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}


保存文件为 hellogcc.c ，接下来编译它：

$ ls
hellogcc.c

$ gcc hellogcc.c

$ ls -1
a.out
hellogcc.c


如你所见，a.out 是编译后默认生成的二进制文…</span>

                              <span>ProtonMail 宣布了重塑后的品牌，包括新网站、新名称、新的定价计划、新的 UI 和其他变化。




ProtonMail 将自己重新命名为 &amp;ldquoroton”，以将其所有产品囊括在统一的品牌下。

注意，别把它和 Steam 的 Proton（它也简称为 Proton）混淆哦！

换句话说，ProtonMail、ProtonVPN 和它的任何服务将不再有单独的产品页面。

Proton：一个开源隐私生态系统




Proton 将拥有一个新的统一平台（新网站），你可以在其中访问所有服务，包括：


Proton 邮件

Proton VPN

Proton 网盘

Proton 日历


现在，新的登录会话将会被重定向到 proton.me 而不是 protonmail.com、mail.protonmail.com、protonvpn.com 等等。

不仅限于名称/品牌，整体的强调色和现有的用户体验，也将受到影响。



现在，你只需一次付费订阅即可获得全部服务，而不必单独升级 VPN 和邮件。这也意味着，经过这次改变，高级订阅的价格变得更加实惠了。



总体而言，让 &amp;ldquoroton” 成为隐私生态系统，是为了吸引更多对技术细节不感兴趣的用户来了解它是如何运作的。

你可以在其新的官方网站（proton.me）上查看所有详细信息。

新网站看起来更干净、更有条理，并且更具商业吸引力。

本次更改的内容

你可以期待有一个焕然一新的用户界面，包括新的品牌和新的网站。



除此之外，Proton 还提到它改进了服务之间的集成，以获得更好的用户体验。



如果你已经在使用 ProtonMail，你可能知道，他们正在主动建议现有用户激活 “@proton.me” 帐户，这也是本次更改的一部分。

你可以选择将新电子邮件地址 xyz@proton.me 设为默认值，它更短，看起来也更有意义一些。


旧的电子邮件地址不会消失，只是额外提供了新地址（@proton.me）。

现有的付费订阅者应该可以免费获得存储空间提升。

升级了网页和移动应用中的用户体验。

新的官方网站（你将被自动重定向到它以进行新会话）。

新的定价计划，为 Proton 网盘提供更多存储空间。


你对本次变更感兴趣吗？你喜欢 Proton 的新名字和新的服务方式吗？请在下方评论中分享你的想法吧！

                              <span>Overtime, props have proven to be very useful in passing data across components. But as the application grows, it is almost always certain that most components deep in the tree will require data from parent/top in the tree components. As such, using props will make the whole app cumbersome. For example,

   {/* assuming the header requires the length of the post */}
    
   

If the PostItem should require any new data from the parent component, you&#x27;d have to pass the data as props to every single component in-between. This is the reason for state management in React, and React provides a built-in state management solution - React context to handle passing data through descendant components without hav…</span>

It is a Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform allow you to automate your build, test, and deployment. You can build and test every pull request in your repository or deploy merged pull requests to production.
You can run workflows when other events happen in your repository with the help of GitHub Actions. Whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository, you can run a workflows to automatically add the appropriate labels.
If you want to host your own runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure, you can use the virtual machines provided by GitHub.

CSS-in-JS
It’s also important to note that knowing CSS-in-JS is not a replacement for understanding CSS in a stylesheet. CSS-in-JS relies on preexisting knowledge of CSS.
There are many libraries that enable us to implement CSS-in-JS. For some of these libraries, when the JavaScript styles are parsed, CSS is generated and attached to the DOM.
import styled from &#x27;styled-components&#x27;;

const pText &#x3D; styled.p&#x60;
  color: pink;
  background: blue;
&#x60;;

This is my text

These styled components can be defined in the same file or in another file. Since they’re React components, they can be exported or used in JSX.

It is a new service that allows you to query private zones from an on-premises environment and vice versa.
The private resolver requires an azure virtual network. One or more inbound endpoints are established that can be used as the destination for DNS queries when you create an azure private resolver inside a virtual network. The resolver&#x27;s outbound endpoint processes queries based on the forwarding ruleset that you have set. There are networks linked to a ruleset that can be used to send the queries.
The process of using a Azure DNS private resolver is summarized below.
DNS query will issue if the client is in a virtual network.
The DNS query is forwarded to the specified addresses if the server for the virtual network is specified as custom.

Throttle and Debounce solve optimization problems.
Throttle - skips function calls with a certain frequency.
Debounce - delays a function call until a certain amount of time has passed since the last call.
Throttle &amp; Debounce scheme:

1) If the user resizes the browser window and we need to change the content of the site.
Throttle allows us to set a time interval, more often than which the event handler will not be called. If we specify an interval of 1 second using Throttle, then the number of execution of window resize event handlers will be 10.
2) Showing the user the percentage of page scrolling. When the user scrolls the page, scroll events occur, which we need to handle. With throttle we can reduce the number of handled scroll events by setting a time interval.

At ente we self host a bunch of open source tools. While it takes a bit of effort on our part to set up and maintain these, it helps reduce the amount of data we share with third parties. We use Sentry for error reporting, Grafana for monitoring and Metabase for product metrics (to help folks like me who don&#x27;t speak SQL).
While we have systems in place to secure the credentials to these services, we wanted to introduce an additional barrier to entry. The obvious answer was to restrict the visibility of these services to an internal network. But looking at Wireguard&#x27;s landing page made me realize that we&#x27;d need a full-time dev-ops person to go down that path.

                              <span>fish19901010: 看到了无数的人想要润，各种润东南亚，北美，欧洲，澳大利亚啥的。
但是我的认知停留在普通人润是一件很困难的事上，主要是不了解，看着大家说的好像很简单，或者不算太难的样子，诚心求教。
我理解的润的定义：
先拿绿卡，再入籍。只是单纯出去工作一两年就不得不回国的不算。
我理解的润的方式：
1 、投资润，500W 人民币以上的投资额度，对普通人来说很难吧，一般国内的普通人不是房产就是股票，再不然开个公司有股权。首先是都不好变现，其次是都变现了，出去之后再重拾江山概率太低了吧。（那种国内公司嗷嗷赚钱，个人出国当富豪的类型不讨论了）
2 、技术润，不了解，但是门槛应该不低了吧，不是当年那种拿个 offer 就能拿绿卡的年代了吧。
3 、通过亲友润，首先不是每个人都有，其次有的话，操作起来不是直系的话好像也不简单是不是？ PS：我有个还挺熟的表姐在西班牙，走亲访友过去好搞吗？
在知乎，V 站，还有微博上，无数的人，开口就是一句，华润万家，先润为妙。
咱也不评价润对不对，只是单纯的求证一下润的难度。</span>

2. 简单操作就能同步、管理相册，老人也会用
目前试了 cloudreve 、ifile.space 、可道云
cloudreve:
UI：满意
    上传下载速度：满意
    公共空间： 无，
    相册同步、管理： 无
ifile.space:
UI：不好看
    上传下载速度： 满意，但看不到具体的每秒速度
    公共空间： 无，资料库勉强算但不好用
    相册同步、管理： 有但不怎么好用
可道云
UI：还行，但稍有点繁杂，可以通过设置精简，所以能接受
    上传下载速度：很不满意。和上面两个天差地别，才 2~20M/s ，一般 3M 。搜了搜资料说是基于 php 的硬伤
    公共空间：有
    相册同步、管理：算是有

fmt.Println(d1)
fmt.Println(d2)

x86_64(以下统称 x86)的 mac 打不开 T.T
我的 mac 是 M1 的，版本 12 。编译好之后，给公司不同的电脑测试，只要是个 x86 的不管是 10 11 12 都跑不了，是个 m1 的不管是 11 还是 12 都能跑。请问这种兼容性问题从何入手？
另外我用我的电脑 xcode 新建了一个空工程，编译好之后直接放到 x86mac 跑竟然能跑起来。。。
所以说这是 chromium 工程配置 or 选项我漏了啥，还是说这就是 mac M1/x86 需要特殊处理的地方？

现在想 6 月 1 号领证，想着就算少拿一些工资也把整领了，更魔幻的事情发生了：
整个流程走的非常不顺利，沿路设卡
延迟晋升一个月
取消房补
降工资（给出理由是之前没有看出来是民办学校毕业）
想跟大家讨论下，这种规定是否合理合法，有没有维权的切入点，有哪些维权的途径可以选择？

闲置的笔记本 ThinkPad T450s 配置如下：
i7-5600u 2 核 4 线程
好像是板载 4G 内存，还有一根 8G ，一共 12G 内存
电脑里有一个闪迪的 16G 固态（很奇怪）
还有一个 Intel 的 360G 固态
目前在这个 16G 的固态里装了 PVE 虚拟机
跑了一个 openwrt 做旁路由，给家里的手机电脑科学用
因为有 100M 上传，就装了一个网心云，用来回回宽带的血
还可以折腾点什么？
我目前想到的是群晖，但是 360G 固态大部分都分给网心了，可以挂移动硬盘来搞群晖吗</span>

如题，我英文不太好，大学勉强四级，而且很多词都忘得差不多了，平时也很少看英文原版文档和书籍，都是看别人翻译好的，翻译的是否通透易懂就完全取决于译者的水平了，好的译者可遇不可求，当然也可能是原本的概念就晦涩难懂，翻译成中文就更加不知所云；

回归主题，老外们在用英文描述一些抽象事物的时候是否更加通俗易懂？如果是这样，我会下功夫好好学下英文，争取以后的技术文档优先看英文版</span>

                              <span>roundRobin: 一直在寻找最适合自己的多桌面键鼠解决方案（差生文具多），考虑因素有和平台的适配性，工程学设计，切换桌面流畅度等等，尝试了很多组合，供大家参考。

鼠标：
1. Magic TrackPad
2. Kensington Expert Mouse Wireless Trackball
3. Logitech MX Master 3
4. Logitech G502
键盘：
a. Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
b. HHKB Pro Hybrid Type S
c. Logitech ERGO K860
电脑：
主要使用 M1 Mini ，有时需要切换成 PC
TL;DR
最终选择方案：1(2) + b + 4
经过亲身体验，键盘还是 HHKB 的手感最好，不忍割舍。左手可以搭配 Trackball 或者垫高的 Trackpad 来用最小的手部移动满足基础的指针需求，然后在需要更精准点击以及大量拖拽时可以使用右手的鼠标，考虑到右手的使用场景更少然后 Master3 有时会出现断连 /延迟 /滚轮方向不正确等问题，我选择了更稳定的有线方案 G502 。在需要切换桌面时，HHKB 和 Trackball 可以切换蓝牙，Trackpad 可以通过有线 /蓝牙来切换，右手 G502 就没办法了。
推荐组合：
组合一：1 + a + 4
PROS:
最原生的 M1 键鼠组合，基本需求一步到位，续航完美，有线可以减少延迟，touchID 极大提升输密码环节的使用体验，trackpad 的手势不必多说，用习惯了就离不开了,右手选择最稳定的 G502 。
CONS:
键盘敲击手感一般，手腕无法垫高失去保护，长时间使用不舒服。多桌面支持不佳，只能用蓝牙 /有线来每次进行手动切换。
组合二：2 + b + 4
PROS：
最适合 VIM 用户的组合，键盘不必多说，手感 /布局都是精心设计，长期码字手感顺滑，配上统一高度并且能最小移动手部的 Trackball ，可以在需要精准指针操作的时候最大程度减少撕裂感。两者都支持多平台，HHKB 可以通过有线 /多个蓝牙，Trackball 可以通过接收器 /蓝牙来进行切换。
CONS：
HHKB 如果不是有线连接的话无法唤醒 MAC ，KENSINGTON 的接收器十分不稳定，经常断连，使用蓝牙的话延迟严重。
组合三：（ 2 ） + c + 3
PROS：
罗技工程学组合，一个接收器可以让键鼠同时丝滑使用，K860 的分离式设计和碗托的设计让人爱不释手，Master3 和 Mac 的适配也很完美。两者都支持多桌面，不过由于 K860 不支持 flow ，所以还是需要手动点击切换，不过相比起其他组合已经是最快捷的桌面切换方式了。
CONS：
LOGI OPTIONS 垃圾，K860 的敲击感一般，而且带小键盘导致右手鼠标必须离远使用，因为 Master3 并不适配左手。替代方案是左手使用 Trackpad 或者 Trackball ，考虑到键盘高度，Trackball 最适配。
以上只是个人的使用体验，每个人都有适合自己的搭配，我比较爱折腾所以给大家一些参考，欢迎大家给出自己的方案。</span>

0x1、引言
恰逢某电商618活动，前两天写了篇 《节约&quot;阳寿&quot;——某电商618活动自动化》，脚本这两天都有挂，偶尔没事就会优化下，但始终还是觉得有些美中不足。昨天下班路上，还想着重构下，随手列了下思路：

实际运行中，通过图片相似度判定的方案并 不太可靠，经常出现误判，比如：

任务描述截图是这个：

而品牌墙任务对应的截图应该是这个：

这样都能有0.76的相似度，不过，其实也 河里，均值哈希算法比对的是：两幅图灰度后像素的平均值。
除此之外还有个大问题：动态计算任务描述文字区域非常繁琐，不同手机的分辨率和屏幕密度不同，对应的实际坐标点也不同。调整计算方式多次依旧效果甚微，后面放弃动态算了，直接写死特定设备的点击区域坐标~

昨晚睡前想了想，还是得走OCR，要么用靠谱的 第三方库 (训练好的)，要么注册多几个OCR平台，轮流白嫖，并想办法减少重复识别 (搭配图片相似度判定，结果复用)。
0x2、库体验
早上开早会的时候，随手逛逛掘金，搜索关键词：中文ocr，很快啊，就看到了这个库：hineseocr_lite

演示地址502了，看截图也不是很清楚，不过看着很牛批啊，直接clone一波，然后cd到目录下，输入启动命令：
python backend/main.py 

当然，一般是运行不起来的，相关依赖都没有装，报缺啥，你就pip装啥，比如笔者依次就装了这些：
# Python 高性能Web框架
pip install tornado

# opencv → cv2
pip install opencv-python

# ONNX格式的机器学习模型的高性能推理引擎

2.背景
Web 技术相信大家非常熟悉，它具有快速迭代发布的天然优势，在货拉拉App中广泛使用，比如金秋拉货节、余额、车型介绍页等，但也存在加载速度慢，体验差等问题。目前优化Web页面体验方案比较多，有Flutter、React Native、小程序、离线包，其中离线包技术对现有H5页面改造成本小，技术最为成熟和稳定。
3.行业方案
腾讯开源了离线包方案VasSonic（https://github.com/Tencent/VasSonic），但截至目前，开源代码的iOS工程基于废弃的UIWebview实现，无法用于实际生产。通过继续调研，业界离线包现有实现方案如下：
方案名
优点
缺点
备注




加载本地路径
简单可靠，无需hook和调用私有API
有跨域问题，影响cookie和localstorage，H5需做少量改动
货拉拉方案


请求拦截
不修改加载URL，没有跨域问题，且支持网页部分资源离线化，灵活性和兼容性好
iOS端目前提供的NSURLProtocal和WKSURLSchemehandler拦截方案有缺陷，前期实现成本高

《10. 沉思录：开篇》
你好，我是朱涛。这是「沉思录」的第二篇文章。
今天我们简单聊聊 Compose 的底层原理。

今年的Google I/O大会上，Android官方针对Jetpack Compose给出了一系列的性能优化建议，文档和视频都已经放出来了。总的来说，官方的内容都非常棒，看完以后我也有些意犹未尽。推荐你去看看。
不过，在聊「性能优化」之前，我们首先要懂「亿点点」Compose的底层原理。
一、Composable 的本质
我们都知道，Jetpack Compose最神奇的地方就是：可以用 Kotlin 写UI界面（无需XML）。而且，借助Kotlin的高阶函数特性，Compose UI界面的写法也非常的直观。
// 代码段1

@Composable
fun Greeting() { // 1
    Column { // 2
        Text(text &#x3D; &quot;Hello&quot;)
        Text(text &#x3D; &quot;Jetpack Compose!&quot;)
    }
}

上面这段代码，即使你没有任何Compose基础，应该也可以轻松理解。Column相当于Android当中纵向的线性布局LinearLayout，在这个布局当中，我们放了两个Text控件。
最终的UI界面展示，如下图所示。

例子虽然简单，但是上面的代码中，还是有两个细节需要我们注意，我已经用注释标记出来了：
注释1，Greeting()它是一个Kotlin的函数，如果抛开它的@Composable注解不谈的话，那么，它的函数类型应该是() -&gt; Unit。但是，由于@Composable是一个非常特殊的注解，Compose的编译器插件会把它当作影响函数类型的因子之一。所以，Greeti…</span>

1. 他乡遇故知 - Canvas
小册 《Flutter 绘制指南 - 妙笔生花》可以说是专门为 Canvas 绘制而生的。其实游戏的本质就是不断刷新中的绘制，在 Flame 引擎中，也暴露了渲染方法，给使用者自定义绘制的机会。这就说明我们在之前累积的绘制技巧，也可以在 Flame 中得以应用。

如上图说示，render 方法定义在 Component 类中，所以说任何构件都可以覆写它，来获取 Canvas 构建。另外可以看到 Component 本身有一些生命周期方法，我们之前已经见识过了 onLoad 、update 、onGameResize 方法。关于 Component 的生命周期，现在先不着急，后面会专门写一篇来说。
2.简单画一笔

Hello，大家好，我是《Flutter开发实战详解》的作者，Github GSY 系列项目的负责人郭树煜，本次 Google I/O Extended 我主要是给大家回顾一下本次 I/O 大会关于 Flutter 的一些亮点。
其实本次 I/O 大会对我来说也有特别的意义，因为本次 I/O 大会之后，我参加了 Dart/Flutter GDE 的最后一轮面试，有幸顺利通过了，这对于我个人来说也是一个里程碑。 - 《从台下到台上，我成为 GDE（谷歌开发者专家） 的经验分享》
游戏
如果要说本次 I/O 里 Flutter 有什么亮点，那其中之一必定就是官方的 Flutter 小游戏 pinball 。

其实这不是第一次 Flutter 和游戏领域有交集，例如：
Unity 就有 Flutter 相关的 UIWidgets ，它是 Unity 编辑器的一个插件包，可帮助开发人员通过 Unity 引擎来创建、调试和部署高效的跨平台应用；
腾讯的 PUBG 吃鸡游戏，其中一些游戏的非游戏 UI 已经开始转向 Flutter ；
因为 Flutter 拥有平台无关的渲染引擎 Skia ，而 Skia 的 2D 渲染能力从手机端、Web 端到 PC 端的支持，经过这么多年的发展已经很成熟，所以在一定程度上，Flutter 本身就是一个 2D 版的“游戏引擎” 。
Flutter 其实一直有针对游戏引擎有一个关于游戏的 Toolkit ，一般情况下我们可以把游戏分为两类：
射击游戏、赛车游戏等的动作游戏；
棋盘游戏、卡牌游戏、拼图、策略游戏等休闲游戏；
而其实上述这些休闲游戏和 App 十分接近，所以从场景上，它挺更适合使用 Flutter 来进行开发。
甚至在官方的 ToolKit 里，还包含了如google_mobile_ads, in_app…</span>

关于动画的内容，之前也写过几篇：
 这些动画方式你都知道吗？
 Activity过渡动画指南 
 Lottie是如何解放了开发的双手？
本节来实现一个笔顺动画的效果。思路来自开源库 Hanzi Writer ，这是它官网的效果：

但 Android 不能直接用，也就有了模仿下的想法。我在这个姐妹库里 hanzi-writer-data，找到了它的源数据，是一个 json，
{&quot;strokes&quot;: [], &quot;medians&quot;: [], &quot;radStrokes&quot;: []}

以汉字 “我” 为例，是这样的，很乱是吧，幸亏我对 SVG 格式有丢丢了解：

其中，SVG 格式都是固定的，每个字母（不区分大小写）都有它的含义：
M x y : 表示移动画笔到 (x, y) 点，准备开始绘制
L x y : 代表 Line to, L 命令将会画一条线段到 (x, y)
Z : Z 命令会从当前点画一条直线到路径的起点，即闭合路径
Q x1 y1, x y : 通过一个控制点绘制二阶贝塞尔曲线
C x1 y1, x2 y2, x y : 通过两个控制点绘制三次贝塞尔曲线到 (x, y)
可以看出 strokes 就是这样一个 SVG 数据，至于 medians 和 radStrokes 我们稍后再探，先将 strokes 绘制出来看下效果。
解析strokes
这步很简单，纯送分题：
将 hanzi-writer-data 源数据，保存到 assets 目录，或本地路径，都没所谓
将特定路径下汉字 json 解析出来
这里直接贴下代码吧：

绘制strokes
首先就遇到问题，拿到 SVG 数据后，要怎么通过 Canvas 绘制呢？
研究后发现，系统 PathParser 为我们提供好了接口：

Hasbro has designed a lifelike lightsaber just in time for the premiere of the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series, one that might be the toymaker’s most ambitious — and expensive — replica yet. The Black Series Reva Force FX Elite Lightsaber costs $499 and measures a total of 6.5 feet long with both blades attached. It’s modeled after the lightsaber wielded by the Third Sister, also known as Reva, a cold and callous Inquisitor set on hunting down Obi-Wan.
Just like the iconic lightsabers we’ve seen held by Inquisitors in past Star Wars series, you can take off one of the blades, as well as remove half of the circle in the center of the lightsaber. There are a number of cool lighting and sound effects that you can activate too, and they work...

Apple’s attempt to dismiss an amended antitrust lawsuit filed by the creator of Cydia, an app store for jailbroken iPhones, has failed (via Reuters). California District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple’s motion to dismiss the case on Thursday and is giving the company 21 days to respond to Cydia’s refiled complaint.
Cydia developer Jay Freeman (who also goes by the username Saurik), first filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2020. The complaint alleges Apple “has wrongfully acquired and maintained monopoly power” in iOS app distribution and payments, ultimately “depriving” third-party app stores of “the ability to compete with the App Store.” Cydia emerged before the Apple App Store even existed, and allowed users to find and...

Memorial Day marks the unofficial start to summer in the US. In addition to using the long weekend of this national holiday for travel and taking some well-earned rest and relaxation, it usually kick-starts lots of outdoor activities — like backyard cookouts, road trips to the beach, and camping trips. It’s also another shopping holiday, with discounts on offer for all kinds of home goods and some great tech, gadgets, and gear.
There are plenty of deals on cool outdoorsy gear to take advantage of leading up to the holiday — like BioLite’s current discount on the FirePit Plus. But there are also great sales happening on indoor toys as well, like a range of Hisense TVs that are now available for up to $590 off. And let’s not forget travel...

Apple may finally bring always-on display to the upcoming iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. According to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple could introduce the feature with iOS 16, allowing the iPhone to display a limited amount of information even when it’s locked.
Gurman says the iPhone’s version of always-on mode could work similarly to the way it does with the Apple Watch Series 5 and up — the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will drop the lock screen’s frame rate with always-on mode enabled, letting them conserve energy while the display remains powered on. It’s unclear if the new iPhone will use the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) display Apple uses in newer Watch models. These low-powered screens play a huge part in...

两年前，Perl 语言项目宣布了 Perl 7，与 Perl 6 的激进改变不同，Perl 7 实际上是 Perl 5.32 配上更符合现代趋势的一些默认设置。原计划在 2021 年发布 Perl 7，但显然我们还没见到，甚至没有一个明确的发布时间表。Perl 语言指导委员会还在继续引入新特性，直到某天他们觉得有了足够大的进步才会发布 Perl 7。


消息来源：perl



老王点评：Perl 当年太成功，但这个成功也成了巨大的包袱，以至于激进的 Perl 6 失败了，继承传统的 Perl 7 也迟迟难产。两年前宣布 Perl 7 的消息时，我还 很期待，但是，虽然不愿意这样说，Perl 不如就让它一直留在 Perl 5 吧，作为历史里程碑挺好。




微软将 WSL2 带入 Window Server 2022

2021 年，为了回应用户提出的将 WSL 向后移植到 Windows Server 2019 的请求，微软说 WSL “对开发来说非常棒”，“对 Windows 客户端来说非常完美”。但又警告说，“如果我们把它放在 Windows Server 中，人们会在生产场景中使用它，而它并不准备用于这种场景”。微软推荐的方式是运行完整的 Linux 虚拟机。但今年，微软的态度在改变，WSL2 发行版已经可以在 Windows Server 2004 和 20H2 版本上运行，而现在，随着最新的预览补丁，Windows Server 2022 现在也支持 WSL2 Linux 发行版了。


消息来源：theregister



老王点评：微软对 Linux 的野心一点点露了出来，先是一个号称为了开发者方便的子系统，以后就可能是一个集成了完整 Linux 功能和优点的子系统了，并且，可以用于企业生产环境。




攻击者窃取了十万 npm 用户账号登录信息

攻击者在 4 月中旬的攻击中利用 OAuth 应用令牌窃取了近十万 npm 用户账号登录信息，取得了密码哈希和电邮地址。哈希密码是用弱哈希算法，如加盐 SHA1 生成的，因此容易破解，但好在 GitHub 从 3 月 1 日起对所有账号自动启用了电邮验证，控制账号的尝试会被自动阻止。在分析和检查之后，GitHub 确信攻击者没有修改或上传新版本的 npm 软件包。GitHub 重置了所有受影响用户的密码，并向受影响组织和用户发送了通知。

                              <span>DeepMind 是 Alphabet 的子公司和 AI 研究实验室，在 2021 年 10 月，它收购了用于机器人研发的 MuJoCo 物理引擎，并承诺该模拟器将作为免费、开源、社区驱动的项目进行维护。现在，DeepMind 声称开源计划已完成，它的整个代码库 可在 GitHub 上获得。

MuJoCo 是 “Multi-Joint Dynamics with Contact” 的缩写，它是一个物理引擎，旨在帮助机器人、生物力学、图形和动画等领域的研究和开发（也包括其他需要快速准确模拟的领域）。MuJoCo 可用于帮助机器学习应用实现基于模型的计算，例如控制综合control synthesis、状态估计state estimation、系统识别system identification、机制设计mechanism design、通过逆动力学inverse dynamics来进行数据分析，以及并行采样parallel sampling。它也可以用作标准模拟器，例如用于游戏和交互式虚拟环境。（LCTT 译注：这段话中涉及到不少专业词汇，鉴于译者水平有限，若有谬误，请在评论中指出，同时也欢迎在评论中科普，一起学习～）

根据 DeepMind 的说法，以下是 MuJoCo 适合协作的一些功能：


能够模拟复杂机制的综合模拟器

可读、高性能、可移植的代码

易于扩展的代码库

丰富的文档，包括面向用户的和代码注释 —— 我们希望学术界和 OSS 社区的同事能够使用这个平台并为代码库做出贡献，从而改善所有人的研究


DeepMind 还说：


“作为没有动态内存分配的 C 库，MuJoCo 非常快。不幸的是，原始物理速度一直受到 Python 包装器的阻碍：全局解释器锁（GIL）和非编译代码的存在，使得批处理、多线程操作无法执行。在下面的路线图中，我们将解决这个问题。”


（LCTT 译注： 这里补充了原文没有提及的路线图和基准测试结果。）

路线图：


通过批处理、多线程模拟释放 MuJoCo 的速度潜力

通过改进内部内存管理支持更大的场景

新的增量编译器，带来更好的模型可组合性

通过 Unity 集成支持更好的渲染

对物理导数的原生支持，包括解析和有限差分



“目前，我们想分享两个常见模型的基准测试结果。注意，这个结果是在运行 Windows 10 的标准 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 机器上获得的。”

区块链技术是一种安全机制，以一种使人难以或不可能修改或入侵的方式来跟踪信息。区块链整合了交易的数字账本，它被复制并发送至其网络上的每台计算机。在链的每个区块中，都有一些交易。当区块链上发生新的交易时，该交易的记录就会被添加到属于该链的每个人的账簿中。

区块链使用分布式账本技术distributed ledger technology（DLT），其中数据库并不保存在一个服务器或节点中。在区块链中，交易被记录在一个被称为哈希hash的不可改变的加密符号中。这意味着，如果一个通道或链上的一个区块被改变，黑客将很难改变链上的那个区块，因为他们必须对外面的每一个版本的链都要这样做。区块链，如比特币和以太坊，随着新的区块被添加到链上而不断增长，这使得账本更加安全。

随着区块链中智能合约的实施，在没有任何人工干预的情况下，有了自动执行的场景。智能合约技术使得执行最高级别的安全、隐私和反黑客实施成为可能。



区块链的用例和应用是：


加密货币

智能合约

安全的个人信息

数字健康记录

电子政务

不可伪造的代币（NFT）

游戏

跨境金融交易

数字投票

供应链管理


根据 Statista.com，自过去几年以来，区块链技术市场的规模正在以非常快的速度增长，预计到 2025 年将达到 400 亿美元。

                              <span>在 Ubuntu 中重新设置已忘记的 root 用户的密码


这篇简单的指南将向你解释，如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 好 20.04 LTS 桌面环境中，以及从服务器版本中的 恢复rescue 模式中重新设置 sudo 密码。

介绍

在 安装 Ubuntu 时，创建的一个新用户将会带有 sudo 权限，用以执行各种各样的管理任务。

如果你的 Ubuntu 系统有多个 sudo 用户，你能够从另外一个 sudo 用户的账号下，轻松地重新设置所忘记的一个 sudo 用户或管理员用户的密码。

如果你只有一个 sudo 用户，并且忘记了密码怎么办？没有问题! 从 Ubuntu 的 恢复rescue 或 单一用户single user 模式中恢复 sudo 用户密码很容易。

虽然这篇指南是在 Ubuntu 22.04 和 20.04 LTS 版本上进行的正式测试，不过，下面给定的步骤对于其它的 Ubuntu 版本和衍生版本来说是相同的。

在 Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04 LTS 中重新设置 sudo 密码

首先，启动你的 Ubuntu 系统到 恢复rescue 模式下，来重新设置一个 sudo 用户的密码，操作如下面的链接所述。


如何启动到 Ubuntu 22.04 /  20.04 / 18.04 的 恢复rescue 模式 或 急救Emergency模式


现在，进入到 恢复rescue 模式下，通过运行下面的命令，以读/写的模式挂载根（/）文件系统：

# mount -n -o remount,rw /


现在，使用 passwd 命令来重新设置 sudo 用户的密码:

# passwd ostechnix


在这里，ostechnix 是 sudo 用户的名称。使用你自己的用户名称来替换掉它。

输入两次密码：

New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully




就这样。我们已经重新设置 sudo 用户密码。如果你按照上面链接所述的方法 1 进入到 恢复rescue 模式，按下 Ctrl+d 组合键来启动到正常模式。或者，你也可以输入下面的任意一个命令来启动到正常模式。

# systemctl default


或，

# exit


如果你想重新启动系统，而不是启动到正常模式，输入：

# systemctl reboot


如果你已经按照上面链接所述的方法 2 进入到恢复rescue 模式，输入：

# exit


你将返回到 恢复菜单recovery menu。现在选择 “恢复正常启动Resume normal boot”，并按下回车键。



在强调一次，选择 “确定OK” 按钮，并按下回车按键来继续启动到正常模式：



现在，你在运行管理命令时可以使用新的 sudo 密码。

如果我把用户名称和密码都忘了怎么办？

如果你忘记了用户名称，在 恢复rescue 模式下，你可以很容易地列出你的 Linux 系统中的用户名称，使用目录：

# cat etc/passwd


来自我 Ubuntu 22.04 系统的输出示例：

[...]
ostechnix:x:1000:1000:Ostechnix,,,:/home/ostechnix:/bin/bash
[...]


好了，现在，你找到用户名称了。只需要按照上面的步骤来重新设置用户的密码即可。

尝试 iOS 开发，终于发布了第一款 app: Mechanical
这是一个 iOS 上模拟机械键盘的 keyboard extension (中文应该叫输入法？)
目前还不是特别完善，已知问题有：
仅支持英文输入
不支持词语联想和纠错
上面这些问题会在后续版本中进行处理，麻烦大家感兴趣的话下载试用一下，欢迎任何建设性意见。</span>

绑定 PayPal 要美国电话号码验证（网上说 tb 有一次性的，但是怕不安全还怕 PP 风控给封了），据说国内的外币信用卡无论怎么样都绑不上美区 ID 的，礼品卡又不给用，好像没得其他办法了。
又查到一个先在日区绑定 JCB 然后转美国区的方法，日区号目前不想动，美区号我怕转去日区绑好卡之后再转回美区被封了 /风控导致无法支付，好苦恼啊老哥们。</span>

在 Mac 上用蓝牙配对就总觉着拖拽感很强,鼠标不跟手.有人说是因为盒盖子或者 WiFi2.4G 频段干扰. 自己打开盖子关掉 WiFi 还是没什么效果.

用起来很难受... 是哪里设置的不对吗...

先补充背景：腾讯云云函数 6 月起需要购买套餐，标准版 12.8/月，折后 9.9
现在云+校园上线了云函数套餐包，标准版三年 3.24 元。非学生，已超 25 岁，也成功购买了（也许是因为几年前买过学生机）
注意事项：
1 、套餐与可用区域绑定，比如买给广州的就只适用广州。目前学生套餐只支持购买：硅谷 /多伦多 /广州 /中国香港 /法兰克福 /孟买 /北京 /新加坡
2 、腾讯云已经不能使用一个实名注册多个账号来享受多次优惠。就是说，你实名注册了两个账号，在 A 购买后，B 就没资格了</span>

之前由于旧光猫桥接的情况下，网速达不到千兆，所以报了故障，师傅今天给我换了个新光猫
型号是：吉比特 UNG221N ，比较新款的吧，我看网上的讨论比较少，最早也就是 2021 年 8 月的
师傅说 lan4 和 3 是千兆，不知 lan2 和 1 是不是，没看清楚
我打算将原来的 R6300v2 放到客厅做无线中继，新光猫设为路由拨号模式，所以就没把它设为桥接试试能不能满速了
想问几个问题：1 、无线中继的话，用 2.4G （ link rate 是 300M ）好还是 5G （ link rate 是 1300M ）好？我发现，如果 UNG221N 的 5G WLAN 是设为“80MHz”的话，R6300v2 搜索不到。要想通过 5G 中继，只能将光猫的 5G 设为“20/40MHz”（这个光猫没有“20/40/80MHz”选）
2 、不知什么原因 R6300v2 无线中继上 UNG221N 后，连接 R6300v2 的无线设备不能获取 UNG221N 下发的 IP 地址，该如何解决？ R6300v2 的 WAN 口能动态获取 IP ，并且可以 PING 通外网。
3 、R6300v2 的 SSID 名称和密码是否应该设为和 UNG221N 的一致？</span>

在 Vultr 买的服务器 然后搭一个 ubuntu 的 v2ray 节点
具体 v2ray 参数如下：
AlterId: 0
Encryption method (security): auto
Transport protocol (network): kcp
Camouflage type: dtls
TLS: null
问题：
无论全局与否，都会频繁出现 Your connection was interrupted. ERR_NETWORK_CHANGE 已经影响正常使用
已知可出现于多个网站，Chrome 和 Edge 都出现了这个问题，甚至国内网站也会出现这个问题。
具体表现为：
输入网址回车或直接搜索后，会出现这个错误，并一直转圈，运气好会直接转入，运气不好就会停止转圈并一直停在这个错误页面。
目前已尝试解决：
更换 vultr 服务器 ip 无效
ipconfig/ flushdns 无效
指定 ipv4 Dns 解析地址 无效
开关网络属性 ipv6 开启后略有好转
关于这种错误我在网上感觉搜不到，求问解决方法。</span>

然后说一下我看上的两款显示器：
一个是明基 PD2705U ，LCD 显示器，折扣价 3999 ，参数看这里： https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id&#x3D;661873145240
另一个是飞利浦 27E1N8900 ，OLED 新时期，折扣价 5499 ，参数看这里： https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id&#x3D;671322466623

                              <span>liqinliqin: 我刚才分享了一个帖子，被人举报推广，为了避免推广嫌疑，
我只说结论和展示数据，
我的目的想说的是抖音确实是个好渠道，大家可以大胆尝试
李博士做抖音一个月，吸粉 1.3 万，成交金额 50 万，经验分享
直接说结论，跟贴出图，
1.抖音上面的人分两类，一是抽精神鸦片的找奶头乐的，二是有自己生意，在上面找客户的。
2.5 秒完播率第一重要，一定要吸引住前 5 秒。
3.点赞评论第二重要，点赞评论越高，推的流量越多。
4.别人合拍的越多，说明视频越受欢迎，流量越多。
我的数据：
我的目标是找客户，因为我们公司有自己的物联网模组、方案产品，我准备推广下直播灯产品，做了如下策划
1.个人 IP 打造，四博第二帅。
2.前 5 秒，抛出疑问，吸引住不走
战果：
发布一周内，3 万播放，6000 点赞，吸粉 3000 ，用我视频合拍的人数超过 100 个，不经意间火了
题外话：
抖音确实牛，我去公司附近饭店吃饭，老板娘非要给我免单，说是抖音刷到我了，不知道以前我是博士，要我给她在抖音推饭店，</span>

A basic WebRTC video audio chat app made using python Flask.
Create and join video chat rooms. The users connects to each other in a peer to peer mesh network using WebRTC. They share their audio and video directly with each other without going through a centralized server. However, a centralized server is needed to initiate the connections at first using a process called signaling. This, signaling server is made using Flask in python and data is shared between server and clients using SocketIO.
For demo &amp; explaination visit: https://youtu.be/ZvG1-s7QmLs
Source Code is Available in the description box below in the video. So do check it out...
To run this on your machine, install the following:
python 3.x
Flask
Flask-SocketIO
Install requirements using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To start a server on localhost:
python server.py

Access Control Issues arise when we, as normal users, can gain access to data that we are not suppose to access either directly or via malicious methods. This is mostly due to poor data/access protection mechanisms put in place by developers. 🤠
Now, with this section there are three parts. Without any further lollygagging, let&#x27;s jump into it!

When we open the Access Control Issues - Part 1 section on our device we are met with the following objective: try to access the API credentials from outside the app. This means that instead of just clicking the View API Credentials button, we should try and access the credentials on the ac…</span>

Toggle functionality is often built with JavaScript because it requires handling the click event.
But it can be built with pure CSS and no JavaScript.

                              <span>Linux is amazing! Let me tell you what made me say so.
There are multiple ways to perform a function in Linux. Let&#x27;s say you simply want to print &quot;Hello World&quot; to the screen. To do so, some beginners might create a new file, write &quot;Hello world&quot; to it and then use the cat command to print the contents of the file. Some experienced users may use the echo command to print the same to the screen. Both of them are correct as the job is done perfectly but the only difference is that using the echo command, we can accomplish the job quickly.
In this blog, we are going to discuss about one such function of creating a new user using two commands adduser and useradd. We&#x27;ll also talk about which command you must use and when.
Let&#x27;s dive right into it.

You can take a configuration snapshot of your pool and then create new pools or clusters based on that snapshot as long as the configuration is supported. 
The snapshot is a resource that contains the configuration information from the source pool. You can use the snapshot resource and the values of the configuration to create a new pool or cluster.
This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. 
You cannot create a new N-Series pool based on a snapshot captured from a D-Series pool because the images in those cases are not the same as the virtual machine family.

                              <span>When working on accessibility, a common issue you might come across is that your HTML tag doesn&#x27;t have a lang attribute.
The lang attribute tells the user which language the page is written in.
Some examples of valid lang attributes are:




In any regular plain HTML website, we would add this tag to the HTML element. However, in the case of Next.js, we don&#x27;t have direct access to it.
So to add this tag, we need to use the next.config.js file.
module.exports &#x3D; {
  i18n: {
    locales: [&#x27;en&#x27;],
    defaultLocale: &#x27;en&#x27;,
  },
};

If your website supports multiple languages, you can even put various values in the locales array.
The default locales are then used to set the current one.
You can even use this config to set up custom domains, but we might dive into that separately.
There is an alternative way of adding a custom HTML tag if you want to override multiple HTML properties.
Inside your pages directory, you can add a _document.js file.
This page will override the default Next.js document.
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from &#x27;next/document&#x27;;

export default function Document() {
  return (
    
      
      
        
        
      
    
  );
}

And that&#x27;s it, two different ways of adding the lang tag in Next.js.

I&#x27;ve tried a few like, mongo, dynamo, firebase, but I don&#x27;t really understand the use case.
Moreover, I&#x27;m not sure if I can maintain the software for the next 3-8 years without problems querying older data.
Am I missing anything?
scaling?
easier change request?
Which kind of project should I use NoSQL?

I searched internet for a better solution which can run in less then O(N^2) time complexity but didn&#x27;t find any.
If anyone has a better solution please write in comments, It will be really helpful.

                              <span>What is JavaScript


JavaScript was initially introduced to add scripts(JavaScript programs are known as scripts) to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser, since it&#x27;s inception all the major browsers have adopted the use of JavaScript. Fast forward to today and you can do much more with JavaScript. When companies started adopting JavaScript, a standard document called ECMAScript standard was written by ECMA International organization to maintain a standard in the language. Theoretically JavaScript can also be called as ECMAScript.
Today, JavaScript is not limited to the browser, you can write JavaScript on any device that has a JavaScript engine (A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code) Some of the popular JavaScript engines are
V8 - used in chrome, Microsoft edge, Opera, Node.js etc.
JavaScript for the browser
PHP for web server
Swift for IOS applications
etc.
With introduction of Node.js, JavaScript become a backend language as well. Node.js was built on top the v8 engine which already supported JavaScript. What makes Node.js standout is it&#x27;s non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient, Node.js can asynchronously continue executing code while listening for other events.
If you are someone new to the world of programming, you could build full stack web applications with the knowledge of one language. Also front-end developers who primarily use JavaScript can work on the backend without learning a new language.
Finally I want to leave this famous quote by Jeff Attwood also known as the Atwood&#x27;s Law.
Atwood&#x27;s Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript</span>

After a lot of trial and error, I&#x27;ve been able to piece together a pretty respectable Windows dev environment. There are plenty of guides already out there, but none of them seem to cover the entire scope. I tried to do that here, without getting too deep into any individual topic. I believe this will leave the majority of users with a smooth Windows developer experience. 
The repo for this guide contains some additional info and will be continually updated.
Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 (Which version do I have?)

                              <span>The bull market is over, and the people with the cushiest jobs – software engineers – are getting sacked from outwardly successful companies. This week brought sad news about Klarna, Getir, Gorillas firing a significant percentage of their talent, engineers included.
I fear this is just the beginning.
So, the chances of you losing your job as a software engineer just became significantly higher. Are you ready for what&#x27;s to come? 
If not, watch my video to hear some of my thoughts on being ready for the worst while keeping a cool head:</span>

According to our friendly neighborhood teacher MDN Docs: 
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
Function + it&#x27;s lexical environment &#x3D; Closure
Now, we know what a function is and in order to understand Closures completely, we first need to understand Lexical Environment. 
If you already understand Lexical Environment lets move ahead, if not then I already have a dedicated blog explaining Lexical Scope and Environment from scratch, to read it click here ↗️ 
So now you know how lexical scope works.
TL;DR - inner functions can use parent/outer function&#x27;s variables and functions.
This can be shown by very simple example:
function greet() {
  const userName &#x3D; &quot;Maitra&quot;;
  function g…</span>

                              <span>Birinchi postimiz Arifmetika 🧮, ya&#x27;ni, Web dasturlashda arifmetikaning qaysi mavzularini o&#x27;rganish haqida bo&#x27;lgan edi 👉 link. Ushbu post esa Geometriya haqida. 
Geometriya
Geometriya - matematikaning nuqtalar, chiziqlar, sirtlar, qattiq jismlar va yuqori o&#x27;lchamli analoglarning xossalari va munosabatlari bilan bog&#x27;liq bo&#x27;lgan bo&#x27;limi.
Muhim bo&#x27;lgan mavzular 📌:
✧ 2-D shakllar ✧
...
❍ Doira
✧ 3D shakllar ✧
✧ Transformatsiya ✧
Asosan nima uchun kerak bo&#x27;ladi 🤔
➀ Shakllar grafik dizaynlarda va UIlarda qo&#x27;llaniladi. ✅
➁ Shaklni o&#x27;zgartirish juda tez loyihalashda muhim ahamiyatga ega. Bu animatsiyada ham juda muhim.
➂ CSS yozishda geometriya juda ham muhim hisoblanadi. Geometriyada olgan bilimingiz Websaytda joylashgan shakillarni boshqara olishingiz va ularni istalgan ko&#x27;rinishda ifodalashingizda juda kerakli bo&#x27;ladi.
Geometriya, ayniqsa, frontend dasturchilari uchun foydali. Shuning uchun agarda siz frontda(frontend dasturchi) yoki UIda (dizayner) da ishlamoqchi bo&#x27;lsangiz Geometriyaga befarq bo&#x27;lmang.</span>

We are going to tackle on the key points in flutter thus give a short overview. I am now exciting to start getting our hands dirty with flutter 😊 Let&#x27;s make this tour together.

Flutter is an open source framework by Google and released around May 2017 it is for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
So regarding to previous series, flutter is a framework of Dart and since Dart is exciting that means that flutter is interesting and easy to learn too 😝 woww this sounds interesting right?

                              <span>Nowadays, security is very important on websites and apps. Sometimes, developers make their own backend incorporating their own custom security methods. Other developers use various cloud platforms so that they don’t need to worry about security logic, and these platforms help developers with most secure ways of authenticating users.
We are going to see how you can use Firebase auth service to secure your react APP.
First you will need to set up our own Firebase project through the Firebase Console. To get started, navigate your browser to Firebase Console. Make sure you are logged into your Google account.
Now, click on Add project and follow the simple instructions provided. Once presented with a dashboard, click on Authentication on the sidebar and click on Get Started to enable the module. Now you will be presented with various authentication options. Click on Email/Password, enable it, and save it. We will come back later, let create our react app first.
Navigate to your terminal and use npx create-react-app appname to create a new react app.
npm install firebase react-router-dom react-firebase-hooks 
Now lets go back to the Firebase Console dashboard, click on Project Settings. Click on the third icon () to configure our Firebase project for the web. Here you will see a config file. Copy the config. Create a new file in the src folder named firebase.js, import firebase modules, and paste the config file here.
With this on your react app you can now start to create login and signup forms and use the firebase authentication module.</span>

What users see is a webpage which loads in the browser as soon as the user enters a URL but, there&#x27;s a lot more things happening in the background which we will get know in this blog post by taking an example of loading freecodecamp.com in the browser.
It all starts with entering the website URL (freecodecamp.com) into your browser
Computers talk to each other using IP addresses but since humans cannot memorize thousands of strings of numbers so we use Domain names. For example, if we want to buy something from amazon, we think of &#x27;amazon&#x27; and not any large string of numbers.
DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for translating domain names into its corresponding IP address.

When we have an application that does not validate input properly, it makes it easier for an attacker to go ahead and creating input that is not expected by the rest of the application. This has dire consequences, ranging from altered data, arbitrary code execution, or unauthorized data access. Not good!

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) II: The Sith Lords is heading to the Nintendo Switch on June 8th, as announced at this year&#x27;s Star Wars Celebration event. The sequel to the classic KOTOR RPG is supposed to feature some performance enhancements and resolution upgrades, as well as a Restored Content DLC set to arrive post-launch.

As you might’ve guessed, the Restored Content DLC comes with the content that Obsidian Entertainment and Aspyr Media, the game’s developers, left out during their rush to launch the game in 2004. There’s already a fanmade mod for KOTOR II on Steam that restores some of this lost content, but it’s unclear how similar the official DLC will be when it comes out.

Twitter started testing Circle earlier this month with a limited group, and now it looks like it’s starting to roll out to more users (via Android Police). The feature works a lot like Instagram’s Close Friends, as it allows users to send out tweets to a specific group of people rather than all of Twitter.
To check if you have access to Twitter Circle, update your Twitter app or head to Twitter in a web browser. When you start composing a tweet, you’ll see a dropdown menu at the top that reads Everyone. From here, you can choose Twitter Circle to limit your tweet to a select audience, or you can hit Edit to add or remove people from your Circle. Twitter won’t notify users if you add or remove them.

Ayn, the maker of the Odin Android handheld, is releasing a lineup of what it calls the “most affordable” portable Windows gaming consoles yet (via Liliputing). The cheapest of the bunch starts at just $299 — $100 less than the 64GB Steam Deck.
Ayn announced the news in a YouTube video and a series of posts on Instagram, giving us a look at what we can expect for looks, tech specs, and pricing. While the entry-level $299 Loki Mini comes with 64GB of storage and an Intel Alder Lake U chip, the standard Loki handheld has an AMD Ryzen 5 6600U chip with three different storage options: 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB, each costing $499, $599, and $699, respectively. The $799 Loki Max features an upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 6800U chip and 512GB of storage.

Comcast has received a patent for a smart speaker — one with a very unusual design, to say the least (thanks to @SteveDonohue on Twitter for pointing this out). Instead of opting for a spherical shape that comes with the Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod Mini, or even the rounded rectangular look of the Google Nest Audio device, a sketch shows what appears to be a speaker with a sloped top and a wide base.
Online records show that Comcast first filed for the patent last year, but it didn’t get approved until April 2022. As seen in the sketch, the device seems to have playback controls on the side of the speaker, with an additional button and a small stand on the bottom.

It’s officially Memorial Day Weekend. Time to get the grill going, throw some drinks in the cooler, and saddle up for some hot deals. We’ve been covering sales and discounts for Memorial Day all week, and we’ve got some fresh ones for your Saturday.
First off, Apple’s latest iPad Air with expanded 256GB storage is down to $679 at Amazon. This $70 discount is the best price in over a month for this configuration. If you don’t feel that you need the extra storage, the 64GB model is $569.99 (about $30 off) at Amazon and Walmart. Though the 256GB helps ensure you don’t run short on space too quickly.

While Google’s Chromebooks are all about online services, sometimes you need a good old-fashioned printout to accompany your digital adventures.
Printing from a Chromebook has gotten a lot easier over the years, but it still isn’t always obvious how to get started or which paths to embrace. Follow this guide, and with any luck, you’ll be churning out paper from your cloud-centric computer in no time.
[Note: unfortunately, the Cloud Print system, which made it a lot easier to print using any cloud-connected device, was relegated to the Google graveyard in 2020.

前言
这是一套 张风捷特烈 出品的 Flutter&amp;Flame 系列教程，发布于掘金社区。如果你在其他平台看到本文，可以根据对于链接移步到掘金中查看。因为文章可能会更新、修正，一切以掘金文章版本为准。本系列文章一览：

【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 叁】键盘事件与手势操作
【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 肆】精灵图片加载方式  (本文)
1. 什么是精灵图
我们前面用的角色动画帧有九张，就表示需要加载九次图片资源。对于动画帧来说，每帧的尺寸一般都是一样的，可以将它们拼接在一张图片中，如下图所示：图片取自于 【pinball】开源项目。

这在前端开发中比较常见，因为每个小图片都需要发一次请求，将小图片拼在一起，可以减少请求的次数。在游戏开发者也是如此，将小图片拼合在一起可以有效减少加载的次数。
2. 如何从精灵图中获取图片
Flame 中通过 SpriteSheet 类对精灵图进行处理，如下通过 fromColumnsAndRows 构造可以指定行列。这也就说明该类只能加载的图片要求：精灵图中的单体必须尺寸一致。
----&gt;[源码: SpriteSheet]----
SpriteSheet.fromColumnsAndRows({
  required this.image,
  required int columns,
  required int rows,
}) : srcSize &#x3D; Vector2(

前言
上一篇我们通过Listener获取触控点的位置作为贝塞尔曲线的控制点，实现曲线的交互式绘制。不过，上一篇有个缺陷，控制点绘制完成后只能撤销，没法修改，如果要调整绘制的图形的话会非常麻烦，这一篇我们来实现控制点的拖拽式移动，动态调整位置来调整绘制的图形。
实现逻辑
上一篇的主要代码我们不做更改，主要是需要实现控制点的拖拽式移动，移动过程中动态绘制新的曲线。不过由于绘制过程中不能同时移动点，因此需要有个完成绘制的控制，完成绘制后才支持拖拽控制点。拖拽控制点实现这里有两个主要逻辑：
控制点的命中判断：即拖拽开始时判断哪个控制点被命中，需要移动。
监听触控位置的移动过程：移动过程中动态绘制新的图形，以便直接看到对应的效果。
控制点的命中判断在完成绘制后，首先需要监听触控按下事件，看看触控点是否覆盖了某个控制点的触控响应范围，同时对于距离较近的点，可能会同时命中多个点的触控响应范围，这个时候需要取距离最近的那个点。对于触控范围，我们定义为每个触控点的周边10个像素点。命中触控点的实现代码如下：
int checkPointToMove(Offset pressedPoint) {
    // 控制点非空才查找
    if (points.isNotEmpty) {
      var pointsToCheck &#x3D; [];
      final maxDistance &#x3D; 10.0;
      // 查找触控响应范围内的控制点
      for (Offset p in points) {
        if ((p.dx - pressedPoint.dx).abs() 
移动过程的处理就比较简单了，我们已经找到了命中的控制点，那就在触控位置移动监听响应方法onPointerMove中更新控制点位置，并重新绘制即可，代码如下，其中indexOfPointToMove是一个状态变量，即找到的控制点下标：
onPointerMove: ((event) {
  if (indexOfPointToMove !&#x3D; -1) {
    points[indexOfPointToMove] &#x3D; event.localPosition;
    setState(() {});
  }
}),

应用
逻辑完成了，我们就来做一个绘制应用吧。考虑端午节快到了，我们尝试来绘制一个粽子的线条画看看。下面是调整前后的对比效果以及调整过程的动图，可以看到，调整后的还是更像粽子一些。


总结
本篇介绍了如何通过拖拽调整贝塞尔曲线绘制的控制点来调整图形的绘制，实际上很多绘图都可能用到拖拽式的控制点位的调整，比如电子围栏的设置。实际上主要的代码是判断触控位置命中了具体哪个控制点。本篇代码已经上传至：绘图相关代码。

一、开篇
  一直以来就想写一篇关于 EventBus 源码解析的文章，因为这是我从业以来读的第一个深度剖析源码的框架，第一次接触这个框架还是我在赤子城科技实习的时候，第一次使用就带给当时没有多少经验的我十分震撼的感觉，可能这就是技术的力量吧。在我实习的时候第一次读了 EventBus 的源码，可以说给我带来了非常多的知识。如今时隔两年我又重新读了最新版的代码，虽然没有什么大的改动，但是收获比以前更多了。所以这次我将以文章及其他形式将 EventBus 的源码解读带给大家。
  我始终认为，写一篇技术性的文章需要准备很长时间和耗费很大精力，并且为了能够让文章有一个很好的理解效果也需要在阐述中下功夫。阅读源码带给我们的不仅仅是更熟悉框架，而是我们能够发现一些设计思路和技巧，培养自身的封装设计能力。
  结尾处会有我做了全面注释的源码解析仓库地址
二、EventBus 全面介绍

EventBus 项目地址: EventBus
Version: 3.3.1
  EventBus 是一个适用于 Android/Java 的发布/订阅事件总线，整个框架最突出的核心思想就是观察者模式，其中被观察者是事件，观察者是需要处理事件的类或者说是类具体的方法。
  整个框架的内部实现是基于反射和 APT（Annotation Processing Tool），在早期的版本是基于反射实现，这会使效率比较低下和发生反射异常，所以在后续推出了基于 APT 编译时生成索引类来取代大部分的反射实现，这让运行时的效率大幅提升，还有就是避免了发生反射异常的严重问题。
  然而然而然而！EventBus 的 APT，需要手动开启和配置，并且似乎这个开关隐藏的足够深，…</span>

根据一项新的研究，只要对 GPT-3 说一句“让我们一步一步地思考”，它就能准确回答出之前答不对的问题。而且，这并非巧合，研究团队对此做了充分的验证。在论文中，他们还总结了让 GPT-3 能逐步思考的 9 个最有效的短语，比如，“首先”、“让我们从逻辑上思考一下”、“让我们分成几步来解决这个问题”等等。这些关键词可以将准确率提升 70% 以上。

GoodWill 勒索软件强迫受害者帮助穷人和病人

安全研究人员发现了一个名为 GoodWill 的勒索软件组织，与寻常的勒索软件旨在骗取钱财不同，该组织似乎是为了促进社会正义而不是个人牟利。GoodWill 勒索软件是用 .NET 编写的，一旦感染它会让受害者完成三个社会正义活动以获取解密密钥，比如捐赠衣物、带穷孩子吃饭、给没钱治病的人援助等。完成三个任务之后运营者会核查验证然后提供完整解密工具。

Chrome 被质疑在识别钓鱼网站方面不如 Firefox

有机构近日表示，Chrome 浏览器无法识别绝大多数的钓鱼网站。他们对新近发现的前 800 个钓鱼网站进行了研究，Windows 端 Chrome 浏览器只阻止了其中的 28%，macOS 端只阻止了 25%。而 Firefox 分别为 85% 和 78%。但谷歌公司对此结果存疑，因为 Firefox 也主要是依靠谷歌的安全浏览 API 来阻止网络钓鱼，他们说，“使用相同检测技术的浏览器在其提供的保护水平上存在有意义的差异是非常不可能的”。

老王点评：确实不太可能。我们得承认，谷歌等浏览器厂商合作建设的安全浏览 API 对阻止钓鱼等恶意网站很有作用。</span>

                              <span>在 5 分钟内将你最喜欢的 GNOME 桌面打磨得更精致。


你可以使用图标、主题、光标和壁纸等多种方式来定制你最喜爱的 GNOME 桌面。本文向你展示了如何使你的 GNOME 42 桌面看起来更精致。在最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和 Fedora 36 上提供了 GNOME 42 桌面环境。

在你进一步阅读之前，先看看调整之前和之后的外观比较。





我将把本教程分为两个部分。

第一部分涉及设置和安装所需的软件包。然后第二部分是如何应用各种设置来获得你想要的外观。

本教程主要在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上测试。但是，它应该适用于 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 的其他变体。

将 GNOME 42 定制得更精致

设置

首先，为你的系统启用 Flatpak，因为我们需要安装扩展管理器来下载本教程所需的 GNOME Shell 扩展。

因此，要做到这一点，请打开一个终端并运行以下命令：

sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


完成后重启计算机。

然后从终端运行以下命令，来安装扩展管理器应用以下载 GNOME Shell 扩展：

flatpak install flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager


打开扩展管理器应用，并安装两个扩展。第一个是 “浮动停靠区Floating Dock”，它提供了超酷的停靠区，你可以在桌面上的任何位置移动它。第二个，安装 “用户主题User themes” 扩展来帮助你在 Ubuntu Linux 中安装外部 GTK 主题。





接着，使用以下命令安装 Materia 主题。你必须构建它，因为它没有任何可执行文件。在 Ubuntu 中依次运行以下命令进行安装：

git clone https://github.com/ckissane/materia-theme-transparent.git
cd materia-theme-transparent
meson _build
meson install -C _build


此外，请从 这里 下载 Kora 图标主题。下载后解压文件，将以下四个文件夹复制到 /home//.icons 路径下。如果 .icons 文件夹不存在，请创建它。



除了上述更改，从 这里 下载 Bibata 光标主题。下载后，解压文件夹并将其复制到相同的 /home//.icons 文件夹中。

除了上述之外，如果你想要一个与上述主题相匹配的漂亮字体，请从谷歌字体 下载 Robot 字体，并将它们复制到 /home//.fonts 文件夹。

最后，再次重启系统。

配置

打开扩展管理器，启用 “浮动停靠区Floating Dock” 和 “用户主题User themes”，并禁用 “Ubuntu Dock”。



此外，打开 “浮动停靠区Floating Dock” 设置并进行以下更改：



此外，打开 GNOME 优化工具GNOME Tweak Tool，然后转到外观Appearance选项卡。设置以下内容：


光标：Bibata-Original-Ice

Shell 主题：Materia

图标：Kora


除此之外，你可能还想更改字体。为此，请转到字体Fonts选项卡并将文档和界面更改为 “Robot 10pt”。

或者，你也可以从 Ubuntu 22.04 的默认设置中更改强调色和样式。

最后，根据你的喜好下载漂亮的壁纸。对于本教程，我从 这里 下载了一个示例壁纸。

如果一切顺利，你应该有一个漂亮的桌面，如下图所示：



享受你的精致的 GNOME 42！干杯。

                              <span>惠普正在以开箱即用的 Pop!_OS 为特色进入 Linux 硬件市场，貌似有点激动人心？还是先来看一看吧！




System76 不是早就自己生产 Linux 笔记本电脑了吗？那么，这次和惠普合作是怎么回事？

嗯，这一次是惠普要发行一款 Linux 笔记本电脑，搭载 Pop!_OS，也就是 System76 的基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版。

Carl Richell（System76 的创始人）在他的 Twitter 上宣布了这一消息，并附带了一个网站链接，该网站提供了更多相关信息。推文如下：


Hp-Pop 好耶！来看看这个：https://t.co/gf2brjjUl8


HP Dev One：专为开发者打造的 Linux 笔记本电脑

一方面，System76 笔记本电脑与 Pop!_OS 有着开箱即用硬件兼容性，因此它备受赞誉。

另一方面，Pop!_OS 也与笔记本电脑完美搭配，适配没有太多麻烦。

Pop!_OS 也一直在推出更新和新增功能，以改进工作流程并充分利用 Linux 的可用硬件。

此时，和惠普合作听起来是一个提高档次的好主意。



所以说，Pop!_OS 和惠普合作的想法有点激动人心啊！

挂上了惠普这个牌子，笔记本电脑的可用性/保修（在纸面上）就比 System76 要好了，考虑到后者在某些地区是不提供保修的。

AMD 驱动的笔记本电脑可帮助你更好地写代码

HP Dev One 似乎是把“为开发者提供多任务处理的能力，从而快速完成任务”作为卖点。

这款笔记本电脑的入门款搭载了 8 核的 AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 处理器 和 16 GB RAM（DDR4 @ 3200 MHz）。

预计它还会搭载由 AMD Radeon Graphics 提供支持的 14 英寸全高清防眩光显示屏。

对于 HP Dev One，Carl Richell 提到了这款笔记本电脑将通过 [LVFS][5]（Linux 供应商固件服务）接收固件更新。

他还提到，这款笔记本电脑（以上规格）的定价为 1099 美元 起。

网站上只显示了它即将推出。因此，我们目前还不知道正式的发布日期。

对于像惠普这样的商业制造商来说，笔记本电脑的定价听起来并不令人兴奋（LCTT 译注：毕竟不是国内互联网品牌的笔记本），但可能是一个划算的交易。

你怎么看这款惠普笔记本电脑（运行 Linux、为开发者量身定制）的定价？你觉得这个价格合理吗？你对这款笔记本电脑有什么期望呢？

首先这个插画肯定是有问题，问题在于审美方向是成人化的、西方化（现代化）的，而不是像我们小时候的教材那种纯真的、朴实的风格。当然，有些自媒体在里面添油加醋，把事情扩大到“境外势力”的层面，其实也没必要。要知道人民教育出版社是教育部下面的直属机构，我们以前的教材都是他们出的，给他们一万个胆子也不敢乱来。
我认为根本原因还是在于审美趣味的错位。不知道你们有没有看过一些欧洲的漫画或者动画电影，我自己感觉这些插画有浓厚的欧洲漫画的影子，而且欧洲的不少漫画都是面向成人的，既不像日式那种卖萌，也不像美国迪士尼动画那种简单和幽默。
人教社插画创作机构“吴勇工作室”中的吴勇，属于 80 年代上大学学习美术那批人，而 80 年代正是国门刚刚打开，西方的东西快速涌入进来的时候，很多学艺术的人都深刻的被影响到了。其实不仅仅在绘画领域，包括电影、音乐、文学等各个方面都高度西化，欧洲文化的影响力尤其高，文艺青年们应该知道我在说什么。不得不说，欧洲艺术那套审美就是比较沉重、克制、写实以及深思的，你们看张艺谋、陈凯歌他们早期的电影风格就知道了。这种审美可以说比较国际化，不是说它不好，只是面向的人群更多的是成人，而非儿童。
而我国当前的主体意识形态（社会主义）也是从欧洲传过来的，这种意识形态其实也是比较知识分子式的审美，我猜测人教社的某些管事的人可能也把这种审美视若珍宝，所以才会选用吴勇工作室的这套插画。
然而，这套审美最大的问题就是不接地气，作为成人作品，剑走偏锋，有个人风格是好的，但是作为儿童作品，反而缺少那种简单、纯真、温馨的感觉。把这套画风生搬硬套的放到教材里，显然是非常不合适的。
在这方面，吴勇就不如日本的动画大师宫崎骏了，宫崎骏老爷子的作品也是受法国漫画影响，里面也有浓厚的左派理想主义意识形态，但是画出来的东西就很童真、充满了想象力，完全没有丑陋和奇怪的感觉。</span>

MacOS 12.4 ，OneDrive (appstore 版），Mac Mini 2018 （ Intel 处理器）
自从更新 MacOS 12.3 同时更新了新的 OneDrive App 以来，OneDrive 就一直是资源占用大户。刚开始时是内存和 CPU 占用都很高，上个月更新 OneDrive 后，内存占用的问题好像基本解决了，但是 CPU 一直在 100%到 200%之间。
OneDrive 里大概存了共 50-60GB 的文件，所有的文件都已经同步了。OneDrive 每隔一会就“处理文件更改”，这时就 CPU 占用率就 200%左右；不“处理文件更改”时，CPU 占用率就在 100%左右。
试过 ResetOneDriveApp.command 两次了，没有解决问题。
谁知道怎么解决这个问题？给个方法呗。</span>

为什么来 V2EX 发帖
是希望能够得到 V2EX 上面爱折腾的软件工程师们的关注，比如在Gitee和Github给我们 star 。
Q: 为什么用 Gitee ？
Gitee 在审查上有一些恶名，但是如果发布在 Github ，很多不科学上网的用户就无法通过官方渠道下载到我们制作的软件。我们期望用户是非工程师背景的中学教师。
如何通过工程师专业技能帮助我们
我有如下困难：
macOS 版本目前只支持 macOS&gt;&#x3D;10.15 ，因为不是专业的桌面软件工程师，我对如何让我的软件可以在旧版本 macOS 上面能够运行比较困惑。而且我没有旧的设备，即使我通过某种方式制作了安装包，我也无法验证。
Ubuntu/Arch/Debian/Deepin/... 各大发行版
目前正在联系一位 Debian 社区的朋友帮忙提交到 debian 仓库，我自己也是 debian 用户
希望别的平台的用户能够了解到这个软件，帮忙制作安装包，比如 ArchLinux 的 AUR
希望有更多的小伙伴作为软件工程师，加入我们墨者实验室，这个非盈利的兴趣驱动的自由的松散的小组织
想和 Emacs/LaTeX 这些软件一样，构建一个开发者 /使用者的社区，这是我目前最感兴趣的事情。
墨干编辑器 V1.0.4 是 V1.0.x 系列最后一个版本，将会是是墨干编辑器的里程碑！
墨干编辑器的宗旨
总结一下墨干编辑器 V1.0.4 和 GNU TeXmacs 2.1.1 的三大区别：
① 墨干编辑器优先服务教育，尤其是中学教育，基于 TeXmacs ，从软件本身角度上讲，墨干编辑器会尽力降低 TeXmacs 的使用门槛。
② 墨干编辑器是墨者实验室旗下结构化编辑器，将会和墨者实验室旗下墨客星球深度集成。墨客星球致力于解决网络上 TeXmacs 文档匮乏的现状，是科技和教育领域的内容平台。
③ 墨干编辑器 V1.0.4 基于 GNU TeXmacs 2.1.1 定制，采用高性能的 S7 Scheme 脚本引擎，并且已经升级到了 Qt 5.15.x 。
重要变更
经过多次迭代，S7 Scheme 脚本引擎对于初级用户的常用功能来说，已经十分稳定流畅
2021 年十份高考数学试题真题（例如：示说网 PDF 在线查看：2021 年浙江高考数学试题）
基础数学结构和希腊字母的输入方式，并配有B 站教学视频合集（共六个 10 分钟以内的视频）
插件： 修复 Gnuplot 插件若干问题，并录制 Gnuplot 插件安装和使用两个教学视频，可用于中学教育中函数图像的绘制
插件：  内置 200K 以内的欧几里得绘图软件可执行文件，欧几里得插件默认可用（ Windows 平台仍需从应用商店安装 Python ），可用于中学教育中的平面几何教学
修复了困扰 TeXmacs 中文用户多年的中文输入法漏字（非期望提交上屏）的问题 
修复了 帮助→查找→文档 弹窗使用中文输入法直接崩溃的问题 
修复了远程文档中非 TeXmacs 文档链接的跳转问题，V1.0.4 开始，非 TeXmacs 文档链接可以直接跳转到浏览器打开 
修复了分段函数的排版问题，由于该修复是临时解决方案，暂时没有反馈到上游 GNU TeXmacs 代码仓库
易用性： 在右键菜单中顶部增加了复制、剪切、粘贴三个菜单项，更加符合用户日常使用习惯
易用性： 在中文文档中，新增一系列按键序列转化以方便输入①②③，例如：@1 用于输入①
易用性： 调整了一些 TeXmacs 的默认配置，比如默认使用 Emacs 快捷键，具体请看发布会视频

后来也尝试过 zoho 的付费的邮箱(应该是最便宜的那个) 但是只允许单个用户, 虽然可以用公共邮箱来实现 添加多个用户, 但是这些账户好像是不能使用 smtp 发信的。
cloudfalre 的 email route 貌似只能收 不能发
网易的 貌似 不太靠谱,都转收费的了
现在用的是 飞书的邮箱, 好像限制很少, 可以添加多个域, 一个人可以添加多个邮箱。不知道能用到什么时候

请教下：aes 的默认的加密模式是什么？ [比如 cbc 之类的加密模式是哪一种？] 没有 openSSL 里的那种初始化变量 IV ，是有个默认值？还是说 go 标准库里默认的初始化 iv&#x3D;key ？</span>

我的以下观点由最近大火的王心凌和可达鸭发散而来。
当下的 B 站充满了某音、某手的特征，标签几乎要被点满。本来国内只看 B 站的，但是这样下去，B 站迟早变成下一个某音。是叔叔真的缺钱了吗？热门里，以及我们难以发现的某个角落里，充斥着大量蹭热度的“王心凌”话题视频。与前面“王心凌”视频类似，“可达鸭”的很多视频也是蹭热度，篇幅短小又无趣，几十秒甚至一二十秒。太太太娱乐向了，叔叔能通过这些流量挣到钱吗？没有广告怎么挣？如果不能或者挣的少我想谈谈我的意见——
有没有一种可能，限制 UP 主每个月的发布数量，主要是视频作品的限制，限制数量再加上限制时长，一分钟以内的视频每个月最多发布 3 篇，这样应该能减少平台的作品量，总体提升平台视频的“质量”。
但这样似乎很难给 B 站带来收益，所以还是一个非常复杂的问题。如何找到一个绝妙的商业模式，充分满足视频质量数量、平台、ugc 的 u （ user/uploader ） 以及更多 public view 的观众的需要。
长视频都很难见到了，根据我的了解，现在也就科技区，学习资源区（各种教程甚至初高中的课程学习、纪录片之类的归类于此），数码区（勉强算上）、DIY 创造作品区能够输出比较有干货的内容，往往这些人能够沉淀下来做一些事情，在现在这个快节奏、快消费的网络时代，什么都来得快也去得快。
我是希望小破站越做越好的，但是像现在这样长期以往不加一个有效的管控措施的话，最后任其恣意生长，最后就是下一个某音。变成某音有什么不好的？
到最后我认为不如直接向 YouTube 看齐，引入比 YouTube 更少量的广告（ youtube 的广告量似乎有点过分，但人家是面向全球用户的），但是能带给平台和 UP 主甚至于普通用户都有更多的好处。
要改变，但做这样的决定，还是非常的难。</span>

有些 Windows 下的操作习惯，不知道 MacOS 怎么实现？
访达，在缩略图列表下多选连续排列的文件。Windows 下只要按着 shift 键，就可以连续多选文件。但 MacOS 下似乎只有列表方式才能这样选，如果是缩略图模式，则不起作用，shift 相当于 ctrl 了，是一个个多选的。
MacOS 缩略图模式下，能否选中一个文件，快速显示它的大小、分辨率等信息？ Windows 只要把鼠标移上去就会显示。
MacOS 能否多选 N 个文件 /文件夹，显示这些文件 /文件夹的总大小？我发现如果多选文件 /文件夹，右键显示简介，会每一个都打开简介窗口。Windows 是可以右键选属性显示总的大小和数量情况的。
如果访达做不到，有没有第三方的应用可以方便做到这些操作？</span>

最近 618 临近，想给 MacBook Pro 配一台显示器，其中有一条要求是能用一条 Type-C 线实现充电（ 60w 或 90w 都行）、4K 60Hz 显示信号传输和 USB 3.0 数据传输。然而我发现虽然很多显示器声称支持一条线实现充电、显示信号传输和数据传输，评论区有用户反馈若仅使用一条 USB Type-C 线，USB 数据传输只支持 USB 2.0 的速率。所以我想知道：
如上的坑是显示器的问题，还是线的问题？
如果是显示器的问题，如何从参数判断显示器满足如上需求？

想用 acme 申请 Google 的 SSL 证书，但是国内好像没有办法连接 Google 的 API 服务，用 Hosts 也不行。
在 cloudflare 搞了个 jsproxy 但是 curl 一下会返回代理页。
想问一下大家有没有什么好的解决方案。
需要请求的地址：https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/directory
应该返回的数据：
{&quot;newNonce&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-nonce&quot;,&quot;newAccount&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-account&quot;,&quot;newOrder&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-order&quot;,&quot;newAuthz&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-authz&quot;,&quot;revokeCert&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/revoke-cert&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;termsOfService&quot;:&quot;https://pki.goog/GTS-SA.pdf&quot;,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;https://pki.goog&quot;,&quot;caaIdentities&quot;:[&quot;pki.goog&quot;],&quot;externalAccountRequired&quot;:true}}

经过 jsproxy curl 到的数据：

                              <span>Yucxxxxxx: 我所期望的功能：
只有当我手动点击“Download Episode”或者“下载音频”选项，某一集 podcast 才会下载到本地。
我目前的设置：
我根据网上教程，从设置-&gt;Podcast-&gt;Downloads-&gt;禁止“Download When Saving” &amp; &quot;Enable when following&quot;
实际的问题、情况:
从 Podcast 里点开“本地下载“后，依然可以看见很多是被系统自动下载的集数（并非手动选择下载，一些英语新闻我根本不感兴趣，也不存在误点，因为一个频道往往一口气能自动下载个五六集甚至更多...)，这导致我常常需要花费精力狂删 podcast 下载集数，因为自动播放完一集后常常会跳转到完全不感兴趣的音频

想要把自己的视频作品单独放在一个可以给国内用户访问的连接上，视频每条不会超过十分钟，数量低于 10 个，用 hevc 压制的话空间以工大概就 600MB 。加上 VP9 的话简单的翻一倍四舍五入 1.2G 。一年可能也不会超过十个人访问，所以流量也不需要很多。不喜欢用 CDN 因为他们的计费方式不适合个人，虽然有免费额度，但是如果额度不够的话会欠费，并没有直接停止服务的功能（怕被刷流量）。酷播云啥都好就是有奇怪的审核限制（并不是不想接受审核），比如不给放游戏视频。Wistia 可以放三个视频，确实太少了！如果它是空间来算的话（ 比如 5G 甚至是 1G 都行）就完美了，不想放在 bilibili ，优酷有超多广告。不知道大家都是怎样存放这种数量不多，展示性质的视频的。</span>

Automation is a hot topic right now. In my day job as an SRE part of my remit is to automate as many repeating tasks as possible. But how many of us do that in our daily, not-work, lives? This year, I am focused on automating away the toil so that we can focus on the things that are important.
Home Assistant has so many features and integrations, it can be overwhelming at times. And as I’ve mentioned in previous articles, I use it for many things, including monitoring plants.

The recent collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin caught the crypto market by surprise. For people who saw Terra as a more secure asset compared to other, more openly volatile cryptocurrencies, and invested heavily in the coin or its associated Anchor protocol, they are now dealing with the aftermath as they let go of assets to try and make up for their lost nest eggs.
A report by The Wall Street Journal on Friday told the stories of several of these investors, including one doctor who explained how the fall of TerraUSD is affecting his family’s future.
Keith Baldwin, a 44-year-old surgeon who lives outside New Bedford, Mass., saved $177,000 during the past decade. Last year he took his savings and bought USD Coin, putting it in a...

Workers at the Cumberland Mall Apple store will no longer hold a union election in June, according to a report from Bloomberg. The Communications Workers of America (or CWA), the union attempting to organize the store, says it withdrew the request to hold an election because “Apple’s repeated violations of the National Labor Relations Act have made a free and fair election impossible.”
The vote, which was scheduled to begin on June 2nd, would’ve been the first union election at a US Apple store had it gone through. Now, that title will go to a store in Maryland, barring that petition also being withdrawn. Workers at the Towson Town Center store are set to start voting in person on June 15th.
The union says Apple intimidated workers and...

Cal Kestis, who happens to be the galaxy’s least interesting Jedi (especially when Cere Junda is right there), is back, kicking space fascist ass with the help of his extremely cute droid helper BD-1. The Jedi: Fallen Order series follows Cal as he works to rebuild the Jedi after the infamous Order 66. The sequel takes place five years after the original game and is once again described as a “third person, narrative-driven action-adventure game.” Director Stig Asmussen says the sequel will include some next-gen features as...

As it occasionally does, the company formerly known as Facebook has produced a new revision of its Terms of Service and updated its privacy policy. The old Facebook Data Policy is now Meta’s Privacy Policy, rewritten “to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer.” 
With this revision, Meta “is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and we still do not sell your information,” according to the company. Instead, this update tweaks the language and adds examples to help people understand what each segment is about.
“the status quo is not good for privacy”
After reading through the new policy and comparing it to the old one, this appears to hold up, for better or...

Diablo Immortal is hell, literally, but playing it doesn’t have to be. Ahead of the game’s June 2nd release date, the Diablo team at Blizzard talked about some of the accessibility features they’ve built into Diablo Immortal to make hell that works for everyone.
Controller support was something really important to bring to Diablo Immortal.
“You will be able to play Diablo Immortal with controllers on both mobile devices and on PC,” Blizzard wrote in its accessibility blog. “Many controls — including skills, accessing chat, and more — can be remapped from the controller tab of the settings menu.”
In addition to controller support, Blizzard is also sending Diablo Immortal reviewers a Razer Kishi controller that turns your phone into a...

Nintendo has promised to fix an annoying bug that’s cropped up in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, a Nintendo 64 game that’s available via Nintendo’s Online Expansion Pack subscription. According to NintendoLife, the bug makes it so players can’t move if they’re hit by certain enemies or items in the game’s underwater levels. The only way to fix it, according to people who say they’ve experienced the bug, is to exit the level.
The issue seems to be caused by Nintendo’s emulator, as players report that they don’t remember it happening in the original version of the game or in other ports (it was available through the Virtual Console on the Wii and Wii U). In a tweet on Friday, the company said that a patch to fix the issue “will be released...

The servers for the Dark Souls series have been offline for PC players for months due to a remote code execution (RCE) exploit that could let hackers take over your computer, but developer FromSoftware is in the process of restoring the servers, according to a PC Gamer article published Friday.
“We are currently in the process of restoring the online servers for the Dark Souls series on PC,” FromSoftware said to PC Gamer in an email. “We plan to restore online service for each game progressively, bringing back servers for Dark Souls 3 once we complete the necessary work to correct the problem. We will provide additional updates as soon as the restoration schedule is finalized. We want to thank all our players for your patience and...

Due to the general but chilling similarities the opening scenes of Stranger Things 4 bear to the recent mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, Netflix has issued a content warning.
In addition to a recap of Stranger Things’ previous chapters, the new season starts with a short message explaining that while production on Stranger Things 4 wrapped in 2021, viewers may be disturbed by the parallels between scenes from the first episode and the real world Texas school shooting that left two teachers and 19 school children dead. In the days leading up to Stranger Things’ season 4 premiere, Netflix had previously uploaded the scenes in question to YouTube as a teaser, but the video has since been pulled down. Netflix’s...

Google’s latest Chromebook update adds a feature that tells you if your USB-C cable has limited functionality, the company announced Friday. USB-C cables can have widely varying capabilities, offering things like different charging and data transfer speeds on a cable-by-cable basis, so this new Chromebook feature seems like it could be a useful tool to help troubleshoot issues. 
“Eligible Chromebooks will notify you if the USB-C cable you’re using won’t support displays, or isn’t performing ideally for your laptop,” Google says in a blog post. “You’ll also get a notification if the cable you’re using doesn’t support the high performance USB4 / Thunderbolt 3 standards that your Chromebook does.” The new feature is coming first to...

Samsung is reportedly scaling back the number of phones it’s planning on producing in 2022, from 310 million to 280 million, according to SamMobile, which cites a report from Korean outlet Maeil Business News. In absolute terms, that’s still quite a lot of phones, but it’s a relatively sharp decrease from the company’s original goal (and from the reported number of phones it and its partners produced last year). It seems that there may be a trend of manufacturers preparing for the economy to get worse before it gets better.
Reportedly, the lowered production targets will affect phones across its lineup, from low-end models to flagships. In a way, cutting the production of its less expensive phones sounds counter-intuitive — wouldn’t more...

Accessory-maker Shargeek has launched an Indiegogo to fund a 35W USB-C charger shaped like a tiny Apple Macintosh computer. The page for the Retro 35’s crowdfunding campaign is very careful not to mention the name of Apple’s classic computer, but it’s drawn some very obvious inspiration, from the beige color scheme down to the placement of the disk drive. The device is eventually set to retail for $49, with Indiegogo “early bird” pricing starting at $25. 
As increasing numbers of phone manufacturers have stopped shipping charging bricks with their devices, aftermarket chargers are becoming more popular. Often, these bricks offer additional ports or higher charging speeds compared to their first-party equivalents, but it’s fun to see...

The fashion brand previously collaborated with the virtual world for more short-lived experiences, like the surreal Gucci Garden from last year, and is now releasing a more persistent space called Gucci Town. The space features a central garden that links together various areas, including a space for mini-games, a cafe, and a virtual store where players can, of course, purchase virtual Gucci gear for their Roblox avatar. (The company says the virtual outfits make use of Roblox’s new “layered clothing” tech.)
Gucci says that more than 20 million players visited the garden last year, despite it only being available for two weeks, and it expects the new space to steadily...

Valve has responded to a campaign from Team Fortress 2 players who want it to fix the game’s bot infestation that has made it almost unplayable in recent years. “TF2 community, we hear you!” the company tweeted from the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account. “We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.”
Currently, Team Fortress 2 is suffering from huge numbers of automated players on its public servers that are ruining the game for legitimate users. According to IGN, bots will post endless spam in chat, snipe other players with unflinching accuracy, and even crash servers entirely. Last year, podcast Reply All dedicated an entire episode to the issues plaguing the...

If you’re having trouble accessing Instagram right now, you are not the only one. Reports across the internet (Downdetector, Reddit) note issues with Meta’s more-than-just-pictures app, with many people seeing screens saying they’re not logged in, blank image posts, “Welcome to Instagram” messages like they have a brand new account, or feeds that stop loading after the first few pictures. Many Verge staffers are seeing similar issues while trying to access Instagram.
Just before 9PM ET, Instagram said the problems have been resolved, so the apps should be working for you again. In a statement given to The Verge, Instagram communications lead Seine Kim said “Earlier today some people were having trouble accessing Instagram. We resolved...

Valve’s latest SteamOS update is a big one for Steam Deck fans — and I am literally talking about the fan in the handheld gaming PC. One frequent complaint about the Steam Deck is its at-times loud and high-pitched fan whine even while playing lightweight games. Some, including my colleague Sean Hollister, have tried a DIY solution to fix the whine, and iFixit’s replacement Steam Deck fans are already sold out despite being on sale for less than a week. 
With SteamOS 3.2, though, Valve introduced a new OS-controlled fan curve that’s intended to make things better. “This means that overall it’s smarter, more responsive to what’s happening on and inside Steam Deck, and quieter — especially in low usage situations,” the company said in a...

                              <span>做 Android 的朋友都知道，在 Android 中，限定子元素大小的方法有三种，分别是 match_parent、wrap_content、fixed size。如果使用 ConstraintLayout，还会有 match_constraint。
这些值被设置到子元素的 layout_width 和 layout_height，由父元素解析生成 LayoutParams 设置给子元素，并在父元素的 measure 过程中使用它们以及父元素得到的 measureSpec 来确定子元素的大小。虽然子元素的大小最终由父元素决定，但父元素几乎不会违背子元素对自身大小的期望。因此你可以认为在 Android 中子元素的大小可以由子元素自己决定。子元素想要什么大小，给自身的 layout_width 和 layout_height 指定不同的值即可。
而在 Flutter 中，就完全不一样了。Flutter 积极组合的设计，希望一切布局都尽量通过组合的方式来实现。组合优于继承这是真理，但 Flutter 却走向了极端。连指定子元素的大小、padding、margin、translate、background 等等都需要通过嵌套来实现，这就是导致嵌套地狱的根源。
以指定子元素的大小为例，你需要给子元素套一层 SizedBox，通过它来限定子元素的大小。基于此，你可以理解为在一般情况下，Flutter 中子元素的大小无法由子元素自己决定，始终由其父元素决定，这和 Android 有本质的区别。
Flutter 也没有提供 match_parent 来让子元素撑满父元素，wrap_content 来让子元素内容有多大就撑多大。但是它提供了 double.infinity。我们一般使用它来让子元素撑满父元素。但其实 double.infinity 也用来表示 wrap_content。…</span>

【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 叁】键盘事件与手势操作 (本文)
1. 键盘事件
Flutter 作为跨平台的开发框架，本身有键盘的监听行为。Flame 中的键盘事件也只是对 Flutter 原生的一层封装而已，还是非常好理解的。这里我们先来实现如下的效果：按 Y 键时，让角色以自身中心沿 y 轴 反转； 按 X 键时，让角色以自身中心沿 x 轴 反转：代码在 【03/01】

首先介绍一下 Flame 对键盘事件的封装，可以看出是以 mixin 的方式提供回调实现的。注意一点，因为只是 on Game ，示意只有 Game 一族的类才可以混入。

前面知道 FlameGame 中混入了 Game ，所以是 Game 一族。这里 TolyGame 就可以混入 KeyboardEvents 。然后通过覆写 onKeyEvent 方法，来监听键盘事件。其中 RawKeyEvent 有两种类型：RawKeyDownEvent 表示按键按下；RawKeyUpEvent 表示按键抬起，代码如下：
----&gt;[03/01]----
class TolyGame extends FlameGame with KeyboardEvents{
  late final HeroComponent player;

                              <span>经历了长达两个月的居家隔离，上海朋友们终于可以不用吃“蛤蜊炖蛋”（上海话“隔离等待”的谐音）。解封、允许外出的小区越来越多，在超市、医院甚至进入小区都要出示“随申码”，这个时候出示健康码的速度就成了避免人群积压的重要因素。那么本文将会给出我的两个方案。
来源：Unsplash
 方案一、快捷指令
快捷指令打开健康码已经不是什么新鲜事了，这里也不多赘述。但我更加推荐下载“随申办”，它自带两个快捷指令：“随申码”和“扫一扫”，相较于支付宝的快捷指令，“随申办”App提供的快捷指令无需应用内跳转、速度更快，“秒开”buff加满。
“快捷指令”中“随申办”App提供的数个功能
PS：建议下载应用后，进入App内“设置”-“通用”-关闭“启动动画”。

方案二、利用“核酸码”制作Wallet钱包凭证
Wallet钱包想必是除iTunes Store以外各位大陆iPhone用户第二少使用的自带应用。但是，假如我们将“随申码”放进钱包后，它就不仅仅是一个刷交通卡、Apple Pay时才会想到的App。此外，双击电源键即可打开也是原生App的一大优势。
众所周知，全国大多数健康码都是实时刷新的，这样增加了安全性，但是也要求使用时一定需要用户联网等要求，限制了使用场景，于是乎上海市市政府在去年10月推出离线随申码功能1，针对的是60岁以上老人、有残疾证的上海户籍市民以及18岁以下的未成年人。只需要去街道社区服务中心、银行等配备“一网通办”综合自助终端的服务点，凭身份证即可领取为期180天的“随申码”卡片，以便弱势群体在线下场景减少不会用手机的“痛苦”。
在本轮疫情期间，为了便于社区进行核酸筛查，“随申办”推出了“核酸码”功能——有效期为一个月的静态核酸登记用二维码。但在自己本人的测试下，扫描后会显示“离线随申码”的字样。以此可以判断出，其实上海市大数据中心允许每个人都有“离线随申码”，但它只是披上了“核酸码”的外衣。于是它静态的特性也方便我们采用不同的方法。

接下来我会讲述如何制作Wallet凭证：
下载Pass2U；
 
 
 在“票卡商店”中搜索“离线随申码”，就可以找到相应的模版（或者自己做）；

 
将核酸码的截图上传，并填入自己的姓名、核酸码有效期等信息；
一定要将“显示”选项关闭，否则二维码的内容会显示在其下方。
点击“完成”。
制作出来的Wallet凭证
到这一步，你就可以优雅出示随申码了！

进阶（下篇文章细讲）
我制作的凭证
这是我使用MakePass做出的Wallet凭证。如果对外观、功能等有更高要求的话，可以使用MakePass制作，不过这价格嘛～ 慎重考虑。</span>

                              <span>记得我的上一台带有Ace字符的手机还是OPPO Ace2，当时其定位为超级玩家。现在时隔近两年后，一加携手Ace系列高调“回归”，并在4月份发布了首款一加 Ace系列产品。随后又在不到一个月的时间内，推出另一款一加 Ace 竞速版。

这种看似“俗套”的机海战术，让我不免有了点反感的小情绪，但是当一加 Ace 竞速版的性能与价格公布时，发现我还是太年轻。既然一加已有精品路线的数字系列，为何不能有性价比的游戏向产品？那么Ace的回归不正是用于填补这部分的空白吗。
接下来，我们就来聊一聊这款起售价不足一千九的一加 Ace 竞速版，最便宜的256GB天玑8100手机，天玑8100MAX+5000毫安电池+67W快充，官方吹说是2K价位段性能真香机，是否真的诚意十足。
以下内容为真实体验分享，希望能给各位小伙伴带来参考。

性能这块，一加 Ace 竞速版采用了定制版联发科天玑8100-MAX，LPDDR5+UFS 3.1超快存储组合，配置最高达12GB+256GB。天玑8100的性能优势相信各位都有目共睹了，而相比天玑8100，这颗天玑8100-MAX针对游戏稳定性和AI计算能力进行了全面优化，能大幅度提升用户日常使用的流畅体验，而玩起游戏来自然也是游刃有余。

在新版安兔兔中，一加 Ace 竞速版轻松获得811848的总成绩（CPU：191517，GPU：313205，MEN：158259，UX：148867），测试时峰值温度35℃。而在鲁大师中，最终得分也有931439分。从跑分情况上来看，CPU和GPU的表现属于中偏上的性能，超过了大多数骁龙870机型。

使用红外测温仪检查跑分时的发热情况，其中正面热源主要集中在上半部，最高温度约41.8℃左右，屏幕居中位置约37℃，而背面最高热源是位于摄像头处，温度约40℃左右。可见金刚石8层散热系统确实有着不错的降温作用，即使…</span>

写在前面
这两年，「双向链接」简直就是知识管理领域的流量明星。
资本追捧它，认为它具有巨大的商业潜力。2020 年，Roam Research 收获 A 轮融资 900 万美元，估值超两亿美元，投资者中不乏资本圈的知名人士。几款亲民的平替软件，如 RoamEdit、Logseq 也在 Roam Research 耀眼的光辉下，承其精华顺势而生。一些具备强大的链接功能，又做出自身特色的知识管理软件，如 Obsidian、Remnote 一跃而起，在各自领域收获了一批忠实粉丝。传统的行业头部软件也不甘示弱，优雅简约的老牌大纲软件 Workflowy 已将反向链接和镜像复制功能完美嵌入，小而美的日程管理软件 Agenda 在 v14 更新里也把双向链接功能加进新版本。此外，我们非常熟悉的、主打 Database 功能的 Notion，和主打颜值的块编辑器软件 Craft 也毫无悬念地都支持双向链接，加上一些我们熟知的国产软件，双链笔记家族的规模可谓前所未有地壮大。时至今日，一款立足文档编辑或知识管理的软件绝不能对双链功能视而不见，毕竟后者的地位早已从一个有附加值的亮点功能，变成了许多用户的「一票取舍」。
如果我们再往下思考一步，就会发现无论是概念层面，还是实践层面，「双向链接」都是早已有之的东西；功能上，很多双链能够做到的，其他方式也能轻松替代。但不得不承认的是，键入双括号构建双链的丝滑便捷又是真切可感的，「双向链接」这个功能的确给笔记软件增添了前所未有的使用体验，许多深度体验过的用户不是无脑尬吹，而是发自内心地喜爱和推荐这类产品。…</span>

I&#x27;m Jurica Migač, an Java Web Developer working as Adobe Experience Manager at IBM iX. I would like to share my experience of getting a full-time job at IBM iX after graduating from the Faculty of Organisation and Informatics. Through the excellent collaboration between the company and university, I was able to link both my internship and master thesis topic with the company onboarding.
Every student faces a struggle to find an organization that will provide them with an accommodating and friendly environment to begin their professional career in the ICT sector. IBM iX was my first choice of employers to apply to for the backend developer internship position. Passing the technical interview is the main task required to grab an offer for a full-time developer position …</span>

                              <span>If you are a web developer, website owner, or associated with the web world, you must have come across the term WordPress. I have heard “WordPress” probably more than “Django or Ruby on Rails.” Later, I found out that this is not just random luck. WordPress will be used by 43.2 percent of all websites on the internet in 2022. This represents an increase from the previous year by 39.5 percent. That means WordPress is used by two out of every five websites. There are too many reasons for this success, and I will dictate each one with the relevant sections.

Let’s begin with two building elements of WordPress — the template/themes and the plugin system. Both of these are generic terms that are not only confined to WordPress or web development but also automation frameworks or native app devel…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m 1 month away from graduating with a BSc in software engineering. I&#x27;ve always seen myself as a freelance developer but that is kinda hard to start with and even if I wanted to work with a company, their demands will be 1yr experience at minimum.
Although I don&#x27;t have that much of professional work experience, I&#x60;ve done a few projects that verifies my skills.
The question is how can I start my freelance career(or corporate career) giving that internship opportunities hardly exist in my country (Egypt) and nearly everyone want seniors with 5+ yrs. It&#x60;s really disappointing.</span>

If yes, then you would know how the development of voice assistants in our lives has made it easier since it requires minimal effort. Forecasts suggest that by 2024, the number of digital voice assistants will reach 8.4 billion units, a number higher than the world’s population, and 31% of smartphone users worldwide use voice search at least once a week.
A voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses voice recognition, language processing algorithms, and voice synthesis to listen to specific voice commands and return relevant information or perform specific functions as requested by the user.

Today I’m going to recap all the most important announcements around DevOps made by Microsoft at Build 2002

To me, Everything started with this Twitter thread and from that article, by Ben Kehoe:
 
When dealing with CLI or SDKs, we are already used to putting IAM credentials in the .aws/credentials file.
However, as correctly stated cluttering the credentials file with many credentials is not the right move to make.
This article aims to overview what IAM Principals are and the better ways to manage your programmatic access to AWS.
Moreover, we&#x27;ll focus on the Credential Process. We&#x27;ll see that we can polish our local usage of AWS Principals with it.
Let&#x27;s dig into this journey through AWS authorization systems.

I recently got a notification about my 5 years on dev.to. It hit me really hard, as I was not active here once I switched careers from scientist to software engineer. 
Back then, dev.to was a startup, I was amidst going from being a Technology Wizard at a high tech perovskite solar cell technology company towards my own startup, which is kinda in zombie state now - we did invent smart functional materials that can be used for a Black Panther suit, amongst other things. 
Some year later, I was freelancing and looking for a job. 3 and a half years ago, landed my current job. Now - I&#x27;m here.
Whats your story?</span>

                              <span>Time estimation in software engineering seems to be the most difficult task.
Time estimation becomes a bit easier for well-managed projects where most of the design decisions have been made and there is enough internal tooling and resources. But it is still not perfect. Things become more difficult for teams with limited resources and external pressure on deadlines. More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.
When it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge. It becomes worse if there is no external motivation or revenue potential for the project. Building something for fun or learning might end up in an unfinished project that never sees a launch day.
Side projects should be straightforward by design…</span>

                              <span>what should I know before learning Java


Well, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)

I am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. 
If you are a beginner, please don&#x27;t use any kind of IDE.
 IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. 
It is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. 
As using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. 
So you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. 
This learning method is slow but very effective. 
Although you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. 
You can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.

surface pro 7 的 i7 版本 iris 集显
然后内置的屏幕刷新率是 59hz 60hz 两个选项
新买了个显示器用 surface dock 连接 刷新率没有 59 这个选项只有 30 50 60 120 240
这导致了一个问题 使用扩展的时候没问题 内置的是 59/60 外置的是 60
但是使用复制 内置的是 59 外置的也变 59 了
外置就有明显的画面撕裂和掉帧 鼠标晃动还有拖影
单独用内置和单独用外置也都没问题
就是复制不行 复制的时候死活不让选 60

                              <span>olin6520: 上海华为 2012 高斯实验室，base 上海浦东，是做数据库的，我们项目组主要为华为自己的设备开发数据库（路由器等），编程语言是 c ，不过招聘对语言没有要求，目前 HC 很多。目前主要招聘对象是 OD （华为外包里面最高的一个层级吧） ，学历要求是 211 及以上；社招的话需要职级能够达到 16 级及以上，并且最好有数据库背景。
关于 OD 的网传的区别对待，就我个人（不是 OD ）主观感受而言我们部门 OD 和正式员工没有什么明显的区别对待，可能是一些流程比如请假方面有所区别，并且基本过了专业级（华为内部的一个考试）就一年转正，我们组去年 4 、5 月份进来的一个同事现在就在走转正流程了；薪资上也不会有很大的差距，主要还是按照职级来定的，OD 也有和正式员工相对应的定级。
我们项目组整体技术氛围比较好，带队的是一个高校的教授，所以大家学习的氛围是比较好的。工作强度方面，周三、五早九晚五点半，其他是到晚上八点半，不过大家一般九点以后走。一个月固定一次周六加班，是双倍工资的；其他周末一般不怎么加班，除非工作很急，而且这个加班也是可以上报调休的。
最后欢迎大家联系我，HC 真的是比较充足的，最近新入职的也很多，简历请发邮箱（ base64 ）：b2xpbjY1MjBAZ21haWwuY29t 。</span>

本人使用了 M1 芯片的 iMac 数月，在连接到外接显示器（ Dell P2721Q ）浏览一些暗色图片和视频的时候，有很大概率触发屏幕闪烁。
本人试过以下方法，均无明显改善：
1 、更换连接方式：包括 USB-C 直连，官方拓展坞转 HDMI
2 、升级 Mac OS 操作系统：最新 12.3.1 依然有此问题
另外：
1 、涉及 Mac 机型：M1 及其衍生芯片的所有 Mac
2 、 涉及显示器型号：与外接显示器品牌无关，网友表示 Dell ，AOC ，LG 等品牌显示器均有此类问题，但自家 Studio Display 显示器似乎无此问题
Ps：
国内外苹果官方及非官方论坛关于此问题的讨论连接：

广东的朋友可能会知道，广东联通有个沃派青春卡 2.0 套餐，我在广州的朋友最近刚在营业厅办理成功。但奇怪的是，身在北京的我，无论拨打 10010 ，还是去附近的营业厅，都被告知系统里查不到这个套餐（营业厅里我亲眼看着电脑屏幕的，确实是没有）。
请问到底是这个套餐只允许广东号码办，还是要去一些更大更全的营业厅才行呢？</span>

只是根据 v2 会员的帖子的一种推测。如果是真的，确实不可思议。
利用居住登记信息构建名单，分情况执行下列二者其一，或混合执行：
第一种方案
预备一小部分人员推行假旗行动，准备境外电话(或和运营商配合显示为境外电话)，冒名诈骗者进行“诈骗”。
注意上一步的重点是，必须让用户接到电话并利用话术维持一定通话时长，方便下一步攻击用户心理弱点。如果真的存在这种神级的反诈系统，目的是防止诈骗，它将有能力在通话连接前阻止，然后发短信通知用户。
挂断后立即由派出所作为正面角色，上帝视角，用诈骗的核心技巧：声称自己了解部分隐私信息（通信保密的通话内容诈骗），及时抓住用户的不安全感，威胁欺骗用户和犯罪分子有某种联系，然后逼迫用户立即按照致电者说的做，否则承担后果。
第二种方案
随机欺骗用户接到了诈骗电话 /安装了敏感 app/访问违规网站，用户核实时无法发现证据，部分命中者声称此系统有效，以加强可信度和未命中客户的不安全感。
不知道论坛是否有反诈 app 的行为分析？</span>

坐标广州，这两天在考虑买不买公寓。
黄埔某集团的新一期公寓新盘开售，在地铁站旁边，均价 1w/平，产权 70 年（住宅用地），可以落户，不占用购房名额。可以一次性付也可以分期付（最低付 3 成，后续分 5 年还清）。
目前自己还买不起住宅，对 28m²、34m²的两个户型比较感兴趣。打算先购公寓自住，过 5-10 年自己有能力买房再把公寓租出去。不知道这样的想法是否天真。
看网上主流的观点都是不建议买公寓，认为是个大坑，比如不带学位、商用水电、转手难等问题。
有没有买过公寓的老哥，来讨论下值不值得买。</span>

V 站大多都是久坐、熬夜、抽烟喝酒、应酬、劳心伤神一众同胞。
我从去年开始系统养生，陆续接触八段锦、武八段锦、八部金刚与长寿，现在依然在系统的完善养生体系。
今年 33 岁经常被人误认是 95 后，思索之下决定陆续公开我的养生积累日志，欢迎有同好一同留言探讨。
不管钱多钱少，健康最是重要。

非带货.本人体重有点大,座椅的坐垫又不是网面的,夏天坐久一点屁股就开始出汗,还有味道,试了很多坐垫,目前这两个的组合是最满意的

下面是一个 usb 五风机吹风坐垫,上面是陶瓷凉席坐垫,吹风坐垫设计的有问题,整体坐下去会导致风口被堵住,就吹不出风了,加一个支撑的坐垫就可以实现全程都出风,屁股下面有空气对流.
试过到处打广告的&quot;空气纤维坐垫&quot;和&quot;硅胶坐垫&quot;,效果非常不好,空气纤维的号称透气,然而没有对流会积热,和羽绒服一样保温了;硅胶垫号称超软,问题也在这里,通气口看着很大,真坐下去就直接堵住了,根本不透气,而硅胶更是热的不良导体. 传统的麻将凉席也尝试过,开始还凉爽,和体温同步后也就是个实心垫子了.
这套方案也是有点问题的,我还想着用 3d 打印整个坐垫玩玩,实现空气对流和末端风力加强,可惜不会建模,如果各位有更好的方案,也希望能分享一下,毕竟夏天真的太痛苦了</span>

   1.日常上下班(次数很少,周一到周五或许只有 2 天需要开车)
   2.周末出游,自驾附近的比如南澳半岛这种地方去游玩
    
二:
1.过年过节回家(重庆),自驾,所以优先考虑混动(长途使用)
    2.有自动或者辅助驾驶功能(查了资料说.辅助驾驶在长途的时候利于休息)
    
三:
1.之前在群里问过,大部分推荐 SUV 或者 MPV.小弟第一次买车不了解想问问有啥区别
    2.情侣出游.比如清远 /桂林比较长途的地方
    3.优先考虑混动 &gt; 燃油 &gt; 纯电(最后考虑 /租房没有私人充电桩)
4.比较倾向于全款,这样没有负债需求.如果有好的推荐,贷款首付 4-6w 也可以考虑</span>

还想加入点小 svg 之类的呢？

马上 618 了，从去年开始的装修也快接近尾声了，目前还剩下一些家用电器没有买，就等 618 了，因为去年在 618 上面买了冰箱和洗衣机，确实要比平时划算，所以打算分享一下自己的 618 购物车，另外一方面大家有更好更合适的选择欢迎推荐
1 、电视
电视的选择经过了很多遍，我的需求就是大+不贵+质量好，从一开始的小米（担心质量不行）到索尼（ 75 寸的下架了而且太贵）最终锁定了东芝的这一款，618 的确比平时便宜啊

2 、净水器
这个直饮水一开始就选的史密斯，很早就关注了，平时价格 3k 左右，618 降了点，但是不多。

3 、扫地机器人
那种带水箱的太对了，综合了一下我觉得科沃斯 T9 Power 这一款价格和功能都还不错，打算入手

4 、空调
本来一开始看的格力的，一级能效得 3k 太贵，618 也没怎么优惠，最终打算买 TCL 的这一款</span>

                              <span>在新安装 Fedora后，安装多媒体编码器来播放音频和视频是第一件要事。


在这篇简单的教程中，我们将看到如何在 Fedora 36 工作站中从 RPM Fusion 软件包存储库安装多媒体编码器。

介绍

很多多媒体编码器要么是闭源的，要么是非自由的，因此出于法律的原因，它们没有包含在 Fedora Linux 的默认存储库中。

幸运的是，一些第三方存储库提供了受限的和非自由的多媒体编码器、软件包和库。一个流行的社区驱动的第三方存储库是 RPM Fusion。

如果你想在你的 Fedora 桌面环境中播放大多数的音频或视频格式的文件，你应该从 RPM Fusion 中安装必要的多媒体编码器，如下所述。

在 Fedora Linux 中安装多媒体编码器

确保你已经在你的 Fedora 机器中安装了 RPM Fusion 存储库。如果你尚未添加它，参考下面的链接来在 Fedora 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库：


如何在 Fedora、RHEL 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库


在启用 RPM Fusion 存储库后，在你的 Fedora 系统中依次运行下面的命令来安装多媒体编码器：

$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-\*,good-\*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude&#x3D;gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel


如果上面的命令不工作，尝试下面的命令：

$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-*,good-*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude&#x3D;gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel


$ sudo dnf install lame* --exclude&#x3D;lame-devel


$ sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia


这三个命令安装了非常多的东西，可以在你的 Fedora 系统中播放所有的音频和视频格式的文件。

安装多媒体播放器

一些流行的媒体播放器，诸如 VLC、Celluloid、SMplayer 和 Plex-media-palyer 等等，将提供所有需要的编码器。你不需要将它们全部都安装，只要任意一两个就足够了。下面给出安装这些播放器的命令：

$ sudo dnf install vlc


VLC 预装在很多 Linux 发行版中，它是一个标准的用于播放各种媒体类型文件的媒体播放器。

SMplayer 是 Mplayer 的前端，它被认为是 VLC 的最佳替代品。

$ sudo dnf install smplayer


如果你想要更强大是多媒体体验，安装 Plex-media-player。

$ sudo dnf install plex-media-player


这将不仅为你提供 H264、H265、VP8 和 VP9 编码器（均带硬件支持），它也将启用一种更高效的编码器 AV1（又名 AV01）。你可以使用 AV1 Beta Launch Playlist 来测试你的浏览器是否支持这个编码器。

它们中的一些播放器也可以作为 flatpak 格式的应用程序来使用。如果与传统的软件包管理器相比，你更喜欢 flatpak 格式的应用程序，你可以安装它们。现在大多数的 Linux 发行版都支持开箱即用的 flatpak 格式的应用程序

为安装 VLC 的 flatpak 版本，运行：

$ flatpak install vlc


可选 - 安装 FFmpeg

FFmpeg 是一个功能强大的多媒体框架，它可用于编码、解码、转码、混流、解混流、录制、音轨、过滤等，以及播放各种类型的媒体文件。你可以通过在你的系统上安装 FFmpeg 来获取相应的解码器。


如何在 Linux 中安装 FFmpeg


希望这有帮助。

                              <span>5 月 17 日，谷歌推出了一项新计划，该计划向谷歌云用户策划并提供经过安全审查的开源包选项，以保护开源软件供应链。该公司在一篇 博文 中宣布了这项名为 “安心开源软件Assured Open Source Software” 的新服务。在博文中，谷歌云安全和隐私部门产品经理 Andy Chang 强调了保障开源软件的一些问题，并强调了谷歌对开源的承诺。

“开发者社区、企业及政府对软件供应链风险的意识越来越强，”Chang 写道，并以去年的 log4j 重大漏洞为例。“谷歌仍是开源代码最大的维护者、贡献者和使用者之一，并深入参与了帮助开源软件生态系统更加安全的工作。”

据谷歌称，“安心开源软件”服务将让云客户能够访问谷歌的大量软件审计知识。另据其称，所有通过该服务提供的开源软件包也在公司内部使用，该公司会定期检查和分析其漏洞。

谷歌目前正在审核的 550 个重要开源库的清单可以在 GitHub 上找到。虽然这些库都可以独立于谷歌下载，但该计划将呈现通过谷歌云提供的审核版本，防止开发者破坏广泛使用的开放源码库。这项服务现在处于预先体验阶段，将在 2022 年第三季度准备好进行更广泛的消费者测试。

谷歌的声明只是广大行业努力加强开源软件供应链的安全的一部分，这份努力得到了拜登政府的支持。今年 1 月，美国国土安全部和美国网络安全与基础设施安全局的代表与美国一些主要 IT 公司的高管会面，研究 log4j 漏洞之后的开源软件安全问题。此后，有关公司在最近的一次峰会上承诺提供超过 3000 万美元的资金，以改善开源软件的安全问题。

除了现金，谷歌还在投入工程时间来确保供应链的安全。该公司已宣布发展一个“开源维护小组Open Source Maintenance Crew”，该团队将与库维护人员合作以提高安全性。

                              <span>最新的 Linux 内核 5.18 版本现已如期发布，本次更新包括针对新硬件的支持以及许多其他核心变化。




Linux 5.17 内核 发布时包含了对下一代硬件的支持，同时增强了 Steam Deck 的游戏体验。

每一代内核都包含了令人兴奋的技术进步，Linux 内核 5.18 也不例外。

Linux 内核 5.18 有哪些变化呢？

本次我们可以看到，内核针对雷蛇外设硬件、苹果妙控键盘和 AMD 显卡增强了支持，还有一些网络、核心和安全方面的更新。

新的雷蛇驱动

说到游戏装备，Linux 的硬件支持亟待更新。

目前存在一些开源驱动程序的变通解决方案。但是这些方案不具有普适性，适配和支持较少。

正如 Phoronix 所发现的，Linux 内核 5.18 中一同发布了一个新的雷蛇 HID 驱动程序，它适配了雷蛇黑寡妇蜘蛛键盘，并修复了宏键此前存在的问题。

此外，这个驱动程序应该也有助于解决其他雷蛇硬件的问题。

AMD 显卡特性 FreeSync 模式被默认开启



虽然对 FreeSync 视频的支持足够好，但这只是改善 FreeSync 显示器用户体验的一个临时解决方案。

现在在 Linux 内核 5.18 版本中这一显示模式已被默认启用，用户无需调整任何设置即可使用 FreeSync（见更新日志）。

显卡驱动更新

针对当前和未来的 AMD 显卡的驱动进行了改进。此外，支持英特尔 Arch 图形处理器和英特尔 Alder Lake N 的工作也取得了一些进展。

更高刷新率的 DisplayPort 也在这一个版本中得到支持。

从 C89 标准升级到 C11 标准（GNU11）



在 Linux 内核中使用的是 C89 C 语言标准，在当前已经稍显老旧并且缺失了许多十分必要的新特性。

考虑到目前的编译器版本 GCC 5.1 的要求，从 Linux 内核 5.18 开始决定用 C11 标准来取代它。

网络优化

Linux 内核 5.18 增加了对新的无线硬件的支持，这包括联发科 MT7916、MT7921U 和博通 BCM43454/6。



针对移动设备的改进也包括对英特尔 M.2 WWAN 卡的支持。

Realtek W89 驱动现在支持 AP 模式、6GHz 频段并增加了硬件扫描功能。

在配置 IPv6 和其他各种协议方面，通过一系列的改进提升了性能。

你可以在 Linux 内核 5.18 中网络方面的变更提交中了解所有情况（包括对驱动 API、协议和一些核心功能的改进）。

USB 改进

Xen USB 驱动程序进行了改进，以抵御恶意主设备，USB DWC3 驱动程序也支持了更多的硬件类型。

其他改进详见 更新日志。

增强对苹果键盘以及平板的支持



当前版本针对苹果妙控键盘（包含第一代型号）的使用体验进行了优化。

改进了功能键映射、键盘背光事件，以及 2021 款的妙控键盘通过 USB 连接时报告电池水平的能力。

Linux 内核 5.18 改进了输入处理，在平板电脑上输入将变得更为容易。

硬件相关的改进详见 更新日志。

ARM 架构芯片的支持（特斯拉 FSD，树莓派 Zero 2 W）



Linux 内核 5.18 现在支持特斯拉的全套自动驾驶 SoC。三星工程师将其贡献到了 Linux 内核上游。

其他芯片支持包括高通骁龙 625/632，以及三星 Exynos 850/7885。

你还会发现 Linux 内核 5.18 支持了树莓派 Zero 2 W，而同时去除了旧的硬件/主板的支持。详见 更新日志。

你可以参考 官方更新日志 和 Linus Torvald 的官方公告获取更多信息。

如何安装 Linux 内核 5.18？

你可以在 Linux Kernel Archives 网站上找到最新版本的内核。你可以下载 Tarball 以进行测试。你也可以参照我们的 Linux 内核升级指南 获取帮助。

如果不想自己编译它，你可以稍等几周，等 Linux 发行版们把它推到仓库。

Agile transformation happens at three levels: team agile, product agile, and organization agile. Helping your team convert to agile is the first and fundamental step in agile transformation, and with good reason. Until you get your people on board with agile, the product of all their hard work can&#x27;t be agile.
Getting to team agile can be difficult, however. Teams new to agile cite these two factors as common obstacles:
The team shows strong resistance.
The team performs when the scrum master is involved, but as soon as the scrum master leaves, the team is thrown into confusion and falls back into old habits.
Overcoming that resistance and sustaining agile workflows t…</span>

I read Jeremy Rifkin&#x27;s book The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism, which has a strong connection to open organization principles, particularly community building. Rifkin also writes about the future of green energy generation and energy use in logistics. In the previous articles in this series, I wrote about the communication internet being joined by the advancement of the energy (producing, sharing, consuming) internet. In this final part of the series, I look at Rifkin&#x27;s thoughts regarding logistics (moving, storing, sharing) internet, and other economic sectors.

Google has announced that it’s adding the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to cut, copy, and paste files in Drive, as long as you’re using Chrome. The feature will use th— okay, hold on just a minute here. Are you really trying to tell me that we couldn’t already do this?
Sure enough, when I went to Google Drive on the web and pressed Command + C on a file, then went into a folder and pressed Command + V, nothing happened. And this December 2021 archive of Drive’s list of keyboard shortcuts doesn’t say anything about the functions. Which is fine, really — it’s not like keyboard shortcuts for copy, cut, and paste have been around since the functions’ invention in the 1970s.
The feature’s rolling out now, though, and Google’s post says...

Though Jodie Foster has built a name for herself leading thrillers on the silver screen, her next big project’s going to be something a bit different. Deadline reports that Foster has signed on to True Detective’s fourth season to portray Liz Danvers, a detective tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearances of six people from a research station in Ennis, Alaska. While Danvers is up for the task of figuring out where went wrong near the Tsalal Arctic Research Station, she and her partner arrive in Ennis just as the region’s long winter night and its all-encompassing darkness begin to set in.
In addition to starring as Danvers, Foster will also executive produce this chapter of True Detective alongside Barry Jenkins, and the...

Sony is continuing to go all in on turning its flagship video games into TV shows and movies — according to Variety, the company announced that it’s making a show based on Horizon Zero Dawn with Netflix at an event for investors. Sony is also working on a movie based on the Gran Turismo series, according to Deadline, but hasn’t found a distributor for it yet, and could feature Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie) as its director. (I’m very curious as to what the plan for this series is — Variety just says it’ll be about “racing.”)

工匠用冲模一次裁切出12块缎面，它们是用来制作4双鞋的面料。为了保护柔弱的脚趾不受摩擦，还特意用一块棉布作为里衬。接着将它们堆叠起来缝制在一起做成鞋面。

                              <span>前言
众所周知，Flutter 的 WebView 不太友好，用起来不顺手。
我们 Flutter 开发常用的 WebView 库有2个，一个是 Flutter 官方自己出的 webview_flutter ，另一个是比较流行的 flutter_inappwebview 。这两个库其实差不多，flutter_inappwebview 功能比较丰富，封装了很多事件、方法等，但是很多问题这两个库都会遇到。本文以 webview_flutter 为基础库展开讲解相关问题以及解决方案。
问题
白屏、UI错乱
如上图所示
测试的时候发现部分手机（如OPPO）会出现白屏现象
原生与 Flutter 混编，打开页面会发现页面布局变了，顶部banner变小了
查阅网上的一些解决方案，千篇一律都是：
if (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform &#x3D; SurfaceAndroidWebView();

但是，这样设置其实是不对的，还会出现以上问题，真正的解决方案是：
if (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform &#x3D; AndroidWebView();

视频自动播放
由于需求需要，打开页面的时候，列表的第一个视频（YouTube/Facebook 视频）需要自动播放。
但是发现没法自动播放，如下图，会出现播放之后马上暂停的现象。
查阅资料得知，是谷歌浏览器的隐私政策导致的。
Chrome 的自动播放策略

始终允许静音自动播放。
在以下情况下允许自动播放声音：

用户与域进行了交互（单击、点击等）
在桌面上，用户的媒体参与指数阈值已被超过，这意味着用户之前播放过有声视频。
用户已将网站添加到移动设备的主屏幕或在桌面设备上安装 PWA。
顶级框架可以将自动播放权限委托给其 iframe 以允许自动播放声音。
所以要想视频自动播放，有两种方案：
静音播放。

在 Web 端调用视频播放器的静音即可自动播放。
模拟点击。

给 WebView 设置一个 GlobalKey 。
WebView(
    key: logic.state.videoGlobalKey,
    ......
  );
}

然后在 WebView 的 onPageFinished 方法里，通过 GlobalKey 获取 WebView 的位置，从而进行模拟点击，就可以自动播放视频了。
var currentContext &#x3D; state.videoGlobalKey.currentContext;
var offset &#x3D; (currentContext?.findRenderObject() as RenderBox)
    .localToGlobal(Offset.zero);
//模拟点击
var addPointer &#x3D; PointerAddedEvent(
  pointer: 0,
  position: Offset(
      offset.dx + 92.w,
      offset.dy + 92.w),
);
var downPointer &#x3D; PointerDownEvent(
  pointer: 0,
  position: Offset(
      offset.dx + 92.w,
      offset.dy + 92.w),
);
var upPointer &#x3D; PointerUpEvent(
  pointer: 0,
  position: Offset(
      offset.dx + 92.w,
      offset.dy + 92.w),
);
GestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(addPointer);
GestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(downPointer);
GestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(upPointer);

这两种方案各有利弊，方案一无法播放声音（需要用户手动点击开启声音），方案二偶尔会有误触的操作。我们 APP 通过与产品商量最终选取的是方案一的解决方案。
另外 iOS 端自动播放会自动全屏，需要设置以下属性：
WebView(
    key: logic.state.videoGlobalKey,
    // 允许在线播放（解决iOS播放视频自动全屏）
    allowsInlineMediaPlayback: true,
    ......
  );
}

前言
最近使用MPFlutter框架将公司官网做成了一个小程序特爱Lite并发布上线。
首先感谢作者 PonyCui 开源这个框架,让Flutter有更多的可能,仅以此文介绍下MPFlutter框架及开发总结。
官方文档 github
效果先行
自己看着做的，UI略丑轻喷。😂




























MPFlutter简介
官网介绍

MPFlutter 是一个跨平台 Flutter 开发框架，可用于各种小程序、H5、原生应用开发。
开发者可以通过 Dart 语言开发 App，一套代码同时运行在以下平台。
微信小程序
百度小程序
字节小程序、飞书小程序
Web (HTML5)
MPFlutter 提供了丰富的组件、接口，开发者可以轻松地为应用添加平台扩展。
以上摘自MPFlutter官网简介,详细请查看官方文档
鄙人拙见
以下是鄙人拙见,如有错误欢迎指正。
MPFlutter是阉割版的Flutter：裁剪非必须渲染层打包成Web并通过 kbone框架在小程序上运行的Flutter变种框架。
实际上是让将Futter Web项目运行在小程序上,借用kbone在小程序下搭建一个可运行web的模拟环境
Tencent kbone Github
那么MPFlutter的缺陷也就很明显了
不少Flutter Widget不支持 核心Widget
很多Flutter三方库不能直接使用如果三方库引入了MPFlutter不支持的Widget则无法使用支持的三方库;dart packages是可以直接使用的。如工具类common_utils、日志打印logger等。
不少基础组件都需自行实现如TextButton、TextFieldForm 针对小程序及Web的组件库MPKit
而MPFlutter优点也是很明显的。

以前台下客，如今台上人，曾惊鸿一瞥，今再会旅程。
2022年5月末，经过一个多月的面试，我的 GDE (Google Developer Expert) 终于正式成功通过面试，成为了国内第 4 位 Flutter &amp; Dart GDE。

由于时间原因，目前在官方的 experts/directory 可能还没同步，预计要一两个星期。
成为 GDE 有什么好处
相信对于 Android 或者 Machine Learning  的开发者来说 GDE 应该是一个很熟悉的头衔，GDE  是 Google 在全球范围内开展的一个开发者专家认证项目，成为 GDE 除了是对你的技术和影响力认可之外，你还可以获得：
提前获悉谷歌内部产品路线或者技术变更的相关信息；
直接和 Google 产品团队沟通技术问题，获得一些 Google 内测资格；
谷歌活动邀请，如 I/O 大会并报销差旅；
JetBrains 会为所有 GDE 提供免费的 JetBrains 全家桶；
截止到目前为止，全球 GDE 大概有 980+ ，其中 Flutter  相关人数接近 90 人，所以如果你对 GDE 有兴趣，看完本篇，相信你也可以加入 GDE 的大家庭。
申请 GDE 的起因
不知道有多少 Android 开发还记得 ApkBus，2013 年我刚开始入坑 Android 那会， 安卓巴士可以说是我的启蒙社区，就连我建立至今 6 年的 Android 公交群也是在致敬 ApkBus 。
而在最后一届 ApkBus 的 《无界》 大会上，我接触到了人生中的第一位 GDE ，虽然那时候还只是台下众多看客中的一人，但是也是从那时候开始，我在不知不觉中也走上了“登台”之路。

在那届大会上我认识了很多 Android 开发的朋友，也结识了一些社区的运营人员，这也给了我后面“登台…</span>

【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 贰】操纵杆与角色移动 (本文)
1. Flame 官方案例
在 github 仓库中 flame/examples 中是官方的案例，对于入门而言是很有参考意义的。 但它也不是非常惊艳，作为一个游戏引擎的官方案例来说，还是太过简陋。

其中介绍了很多基本模块，每个模块中的案例都能很方便地找到对应的源码，这一点还是很值得肯定的。

本文我们将基于如下的 Joystick 案例，介绍一下操纵杆的使用，以及角色的移动。移动是最基础的游戏交互，还是先介绍为好。

本文的效果如下，通过左下角的操纵杆，来移动角色：本文源码于 【lib/02】

2. 操纵杆的使用
操纵杆的原理非常简单，如下以大圆中心为原点建立坐标系，正方向分别向 右 和 下 。通过小圆心的坐标就可以确定偏移量以及旋转角度。这里主要使用偏移量来修改角色的 position 位置。

同样，操纵杆本身也是 Component 构建。如下，在 TolyGame 的 onLoad中构造 JoystickComponent 对象，通过 add 方法加入到游戏中。主要这里的 TolyGame 需要混入 HasDraggables ，才能支持操纵杆拖拽。

背景
首先看到标题，相信大家已经血压飙升了，既然都用了Flutter，怎么还用原生的网络库呢？这不是多此一举么。emmmmm，当我看到这个需求的时候一样恼火。但因为我们项目中使用的Dio库不支持查询DNS、SSL等所需时间（至少我没找到），而Okhttp却可以。因此，不得以只能借助原生网络库去实现此功能。
实现方案
既然必须要去实现，那摆在面前的问题就是如何去实现了。最简单粗暴的一个方式，就是通过建立一个Flutter Channel将网络请求的所有信息传到原生，但脑补一波后，发现实现起来太过麻烦，一堆header,body,data等信息都需要自己组装，并且致命的是需要改动现有项目的请求方式。因此为了避免项目大改，最后看中了Dio提供的interceptors（拦截器）功能，在拦截器中，我们可以对网络请求进行拦截，拦截后再通过FlutterChannel发给原生进行网络请求。这样既避免了项目改动，也省去了数据组装，很容易的达到了目标。
实现步骤
首先定义一个拦截器（NativeNetInterceptor），用来转发网络请求，在onRequest中，我们调用了NativeNet.sendRequestToNative方法，用来接收接口中的参数（url、header、body、data、等等等），方便下一步转发。catch模块主要用来捕获异常，如果是DioError，直接reject，如果是其他异常，可以调用handler.next(options)继续走Dio请求，当作兜底方案。这里我注释掉了。

  final Dio dio;
  final NativeNetOptions op…</span>

                              <span>In JavaScript, you use RegEx to match patterns in characters. Combining this with the .split() string method gives you more splitting powers.

@潘誉晗：杨本芬「看见女性」三重奏《秋园》《浮木》《我本芬芳》

在历史的过往中看见女性。
——荐杨本芬「看见女性」三重奏

《秋园》《浮木》和《我本芬芳》是杨本芬老奶奶所写的「看见女性」三重奏，由良心出版社「乐府文化」出品。在 2020 年的时候，这本素人作者的书一经推出之后，不仅迅速登上了各大排行榜，也拯救了「乐府文化」这一品牌。之后，杨奶奶又写了《浮木》和《我本芬芳》。在这三本系列的故事中，杨本芬老奶奶回忆了母亲浮木般挣扎的一生，写了乡间那些人的生生死死，还写了自己看似固若金汤可其实没能获得真正幸福的婚姻。

三本连着一起读的过程很爽，也对于杨奶奶的家族和人生有着更进一步地了解，可也正是因此，读完之后甚至是整个阅读的过程，我的心情都非常沉重。即使是那样小小的三本册子，可我依然可以在三十万的文字中，感受到上个世纪年纪，普通女性在大时代背景下的那种挣扎。在《秋园》中，我们可以看到杨奶奶的母亲秋园，少年失父，中年失子、失夫，为了让孩子们活下去，改嫁之后的她到异地生活了二十年；在《浮木》中，除了杨奶奶的一家人，我们也能够看到那个时代的人的更多面，或无奈自由选择婚姻，亦或者身世浮沉，无论哪一种，最后都在时代的巨轮中被淹没；而在《我本芬芳》中，杨奶奶把笔触伸向了自己六十年的婚姻，那是一段看了更让人心疼的真实，为了不下放，为了可以继续学习，和只认识两个月的陌生人结婚，可婚前的种种示好在婚后都变成了不体谅的冷漠，当她的婚姻走过六十年的钻石婚，留下的也只是对方冷冰冰的…</span>

                              <span>我在Steam里游戏时间最长的三个分别是：了不起的修真模拟器、鬼谷八荒、觅长生。我看的网文类型中修真题材也有很高的占比，例如飘渺之旅、修真世界、诛仙、修真门派掌门路、仙剑神曲。不仅仅是中文圈子里，国外很多毫无中文文化背景的人也在追粗浅翻译的修真网文，或是玩修真游戏，并为之着迷。当然对于专有名词的翻译也苦了这些游戏制作组们了。
也不仅仅是游戏和网文，现在更多的文化作品例如影视剧、漫画、电影等也开始了修真题材的创作，甚至有爆款的产品出圈。即使不接触这些题材的文艺作品，修真世界内的很多设定也在现实中有了广泛的影响力，有些做到了广为人知，甚至形成了影响力不小的亚文化，像是飞剑、丹符等。
结合我自己的感受和观察到的种种现象，让我不禁有些惊讶于修真这个题材的原始吸引力。这让我在阅读或游玩的时候开始留意起了种种元素或设定，试图寻找让人着迷的原因。之前看过新垣平博士的《剑桥倚天屠龙史》，看着一本正经的分析“小龙女身世考”和“论光明顶战争的意义”，不禁让人在恍惚之余，也惊讶与修真世界类似的武侠世界有着如此丰富的累积，甚至可以让人凭借小说情节写史。
通过对比、寻找和分析，目前我找到了几个可能的答案。
极其完善自洽的世界设定
修真大陆的世界观
修真这个题材首先给人最直观的感受就是世界观和设定的完善，一个好的框架加上不断的内容填充，发展到现在，很多创作者可以无需增减直接拿来用。便捷的创作条件就会有利于新作品的诞生，进而继续拓展修真的世界观。
简单介绍一下我能想到的设定，因为想要详细展开再加考证的话一本书的厚度都够呛。
修真世界的大陆应该是使用了古代神话故事里的原型，根据剧情进行微调，但大多数会有不同环境的陆地和海外岛屿组成。根据天地灵气的程度，区分为不同的世界等级，例如人界、仙界、神界、冥界之类，修士修炼之后可以不断的往上突破，术语叫飞升。人界就是我们生活的世界，大陆上会有不同的种族，例如人类、妖…</span>

                              <span>前一阵，12代处理器的弯曲问题被推上了风口浪尖。毕竟LGA1700的处理器变成了长方形，纵向弯矩增大，抗弯能力自然也是变弱了。而且由于扣具的设计问题，处理器有极大的弯曲风险。当然现在还是有针对性的解决办法：

原装扣具安装垫片
选用第三方扣具

具体影响多大、效果如何，还是得通过实际测试看看。

 
本期文章中您将看到：

测试平台介绍
12代处理器第三方防弯扣具实测效果对比

1.谈谈本次的平台
对于处理器温度影响最大的两个因素，一个是散热器自身的散热能力，另外一个是机箱的整体风道情况。为了体现更换扣具前后的差异，直接插满内存摘了显卡，保证完全是处理器单拷的状态进行相关测试。

Intel 12400规格为10nm制程，6核12线，设计TDP 65W，18MB L3 Cache。默频2.5GHz，单核睿频4.4GHz，全核睿频3.8GHz。其Fritz Chess Benchmark多线程成绩为54.42倍P3，26121千步每秒；CineBench R20成绩为4784pts。

作为一款入门级的四热管散热器，冰立方400性价比真的太高了，另外一个四百知道吧，这个完全是全面升级款，而且拆装还不割手。一百出头的价格能与压220W的热功耗，除了那些旗舰级的大火炉外，各款中端处理器压起来毫不费力。而且作为新一代的散热器，更换新款扣具后，借助2mm的金属背板和转接架，能够完美兼容消费级平台同时，安装更为简单和牢固。

当然，全新散热器最重要的就是自带的硅脂，布得看着越整齐自然产品级别越高。同样也能看到，中心的两根热管是贴在一起的，更靠近CPU核心顶部的位置，能够更好地解决低纳米制程处理器积热问题。

矩阵式散热器片采用冲压工艺，配上扣合Fin+折边Fin工艺， 在保留了相应散热能力的同时，把塔体做到了宽45mm高155mm这种兼容性极佳的小尺寸。哪怕内存的马甲再高，也完全不会产…</span>

在这个信息过载的时代，我既是一名知识汲取的受益者，同时也是知识反噬的焦虑者。作为一名信息安全从业者，需要具有大量的阅读和碎片知识的积累，来帮助自己完善知识体系、提升对安全认知的见解。在这个成长的过程中，同时也会伴随着反噬、焦虑，比如自己的精力和意志时常产生矛盾互相打架，收藏的paper、想做的 ideas 积压的越来越多，生活和技术分配的时间失去了平衡等等，导致陷入在信息洪流和知识焦虑中难以自拔。
之前有一段时间，我大部分信息来源渠道，甚至娱乐相关的APP几乎都被技术相关话题所淹没，我被自己困在了自己勾勒的信息茧房中，抛开技术仿佛就是一只小白懵懵糟糟，唯一换来的可能就是朋友的调侃只要发给我的paper，好像都被我提前看过了，而得到的那一丝丝“奇怪的自豪感”。
无休止的奔跑、野蛮的阅读、仅靠意志力和信息洪流正面刚，诚然量变会产生质变能够带来不少帮助，并且这种“野蛮”、“痛”的过程我一直也认为是很有必要的，只是在经历过后，需要能够把自己拽出来，进而更好更有效率的学习沉淀。当下不敢说摆脱了知识焦虑的困扰，自己偶尔也还是会出现焦虑，“禁闭”个一两天和自己作对下，但相比之前好了很多，同时在这个过程中也有了一些自己的感悟，拿出来和大家一起交流，共同捍卫我们的信息流。
0x02 为无休止的奔跑，按下暂停键
无休止的奔跑，会让信息积压的更多，既给自己增添焦虑感，也不利于内容吸收。因此需要阶段性的按下暂停键，回顾整理沉淀，降低知识的焦虑感。如何降低知识焦虑感？我有如下这几个小 tips 和大家分享：
1、减少Inbox收集入口，不再随意使用收藏功能
之前零碎信息管理上有个明显的问题，就是入口过多，多个信息渠道收藏、转发，甚至有时候图一时方便直接截图或粘贴备忘录，导致回顾整理起来非常耗费精力。因此开始缩减入口，减少在不同渠道平台上使用收藏功能，把过滤后的信息入口，统一都放入在 …</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。

2020 年，根据对欧洲、亚洲、北美和南美 29 个国家和地区的 8709 名消费者的调查，语言服务咨询机构 CSA Research 发现，76% 的人在网购时更喜欢购买用自己母语标示了信息的产品，40% 的人永远不会从非母语网站上买东西。因此，CSA 给这份报告起的标题是《B2C：看不懂就不买》。
这再次印证了语言支持对于提升用户体验、促进用户增长的重要性。CSA 认为，本地语言支持可以打造更具粘性的消费者关系，而且更强大的全球化品牌，也会极大地影响购买决策。
这也是为什么专注于产品全球化咨询的独立商业咨询师 John Yunker，会十几年如一日地收集汇总和分析全球品牌网站的语言支持情况。他把网站或应用（主要是网站）上的语言选单——引导用户进入本地化版本网站的登陆页面和页首菜单称为「全球入口」（global gateway），当用户打开一个非自己母语的网页时，首先会寻找这个入口，把语言切换到自己的母语。
但在设计语言选单的时候，不同的公司/网站采取的策略各不相同，设计网站 SmashingMagazine.com 的主编、UX 设计师、前端开发者 Vitaly Friedman 就撰写了 一篇非常详尽的文章，梳理分析了现有网站实现语言选单时的各种做法，最后总结出了非常具有实操价值的语言选单设计原则。

When trying to familiarize yourself with someone else&#x27;s project, you usually appreciate the comments left behind that help you understand the meaning of their code. In the same way, whenever you are programming, whether for yourself or for others, it is good practice to comment your own code. All programming languages offer a special syntax to mark a word, a line, or a whole section as a comment. Those areas are then ignored by the compiler or interpreter when the source code is processed. 
Comments don&#x27;t take the place of documentation, but there is a way to use your comments to produce documentation easily. Meet Doxygen, an open source tool for generatin…</span>

Vely is a tool for writing web and command-line applications in C. Vely combines high performance and the low footprint associated with C programming with ease of use and improved safety reminiscent of languages like PHP. It&#x27;s free and open source software, and licensed under GPLv3 and LGPL 3 for libraries, so you can even build commercial software with it.
Vely works on major Linux distributions and processor architectures. You can use webservers, such as Apache, Nginx, or others, and databases such as MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
You can use Vely for web applications, command-line programs, as middleware, database applications, services software, data integr…</span>

兆芯早在 2019 年就推出了代号为 “陆家嘴” 的 16 纳米 x86 CPU，可以用于笔记本电脑、服务器等设备。“陆家嘴” CPU 的运行频率可达 3GHz，支持 DDR4-3200 内存，可处理高达 64GB 的内存。本周，GCC 编译器对 “陆家嘴” 的支持再次被送出，因为他们之前的上游尝试由于在周期中较晚而没有进入 GCC 12。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：中国的 CPU 要想得到更多支持，积极向上游提交代码才行，兆芯在最近几个月才开始尝试在 GCC 中对“陆家嘴”进行上游检测和支持。




AI 正在打破专利法

过去几年，越来越多的发明涉及到了 AI。AI 帮助设计药物，开发疫苗，发现新材料。它的广泛使用对现有的专利制度构成了挑战。因为旧的专利法假设发明者是人类。如果法院和政府决定 AI 创造的发明不能授予专利，无疑这将会产生巨大影响，将会降低利用 AI 进行研究和发明的积极性。有研究人员提出设计新的 AI 专利法律 AI-IP 去保护 AI 的发明。

老王点评：你看，随着 AI 能拥有专利，以后具有 AI 的机器人也会逐渐得到更多的法律地位。




科学家们正在建立量子互联网

中国和美国等国家已经在量子计算机方面取得了一些进展，但如果没有“量子互联网”，量子计算将无法发挥其潜力。量子互联网是可以在遥远的机器之间发送量子信息的计算机网络。量子传送可以在不同地点之间传递信息，而不需要实际移动容纳信息的物理物质，而且这种方式无法拦截。之前，科学家只能做到在两个地点传送量子，而现在荷兰代尔夫特理工大学的研究人员做到了在三个地点间传送，他们的目标是最终建立一个量子互联网。

老王点评：量子技术就这样一步步进步，我现在已经完全无法想象量子计算能将这个世界变成什么样子了。

                              <span>在 Fedora 中重置忘记的 root 密码。




你是否忘记了 Fedora 中的 root 密码？或者你想更改 Fedora 系统中的 root 用户密码？没问题！本手册将指导你在 Fedora 操作系统中完成更改或重置 root 密码的步骤。

注意： 本手册已在 Fedora 36 和 35 版本上进行了正式测试。下面提供的步骤与在 Fedora Silverblue 和旧 Fedora 版本中重置 root 密码的步骤相同。

步骤 1 - 打开 Fedora 系统并按下 ESC 键，直到看到 GRUB 启动菜单。出现 GRUB 菜单后，选择要引导的内核并按下 e 编辑选定的引导条目。



步骤 2 - 在下一个页面中，你将看到所有启动参数。找到名为 ro 的参数。



步骤 3 - 将 ro 参数替换为 rw init&#x3D;/sysroot/bin/sh。请注意 rw 和 init&#x3D;/sysroot...之间的空格。修改后的内核参数行应如下所示。



步骤 4 - 上述步骤更改参数后，按 Ctrl+x 进入紧急模式，即单用户模式。

在紧急模式下，输入以下命令以 读/写 模式挂载根文件系统（/）。

chroot /sysroot/




步骤 5 - 现在使用 passwd 命令重置 root 密码：

passwd root


输入两次 root 密码。我建议使用强密码。



步骤 6 - 重置 root 密码后，运行以下命令在重启时启用 SELinux 重新标记：

touch /.autorelabel




步骤 7 - 最后，退出单用户模式并通过运行以下命令将 Fedora 系统重启到正常模式：

exit


reboot


等待 SELinux 重新标记完成。这将需要几分钟，具体时长取决于文件系统的大小和硬盘的速度。



步骤 8 - 文件系统重新标记完成后，你可以使用新的 root 密码登录到你的 Fedora 系统。



如你所见，在 Fedora 36 中重置 root 密码的步骤非常简单，并且与 在 RHEL 中重置 root 密码 及其衍生版本（如 CentOS、AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux）完全相同。

                              <span>在中国面积最大的沙漠上，修建一条522公里长的公路——这是中国人在“死亡之海”中创造的奇迹。
如今，这条沙漠公路有70多⽶宽的防护林带相依相伴，支撑它的是108座水井房、2000万株植物、和一群养护工人的坚守与奉献，让道路不再受风沙侵扰，让不可能变成了可能。
我们是如何在塔克拉玛干，修建出这条极致的沙漠公路的？@vivo  联合@星球研究所 出品短片《穿越塔克拉玛干，有多难？》，跟随镜头，一起走进这条传奇公路！#vivo X Note大屏商务旗舰#

Compose 在动画方面下足了功夫，提供了种类丰富的 API。但也正由于 API 种类繁多，如果想一气儿学下来，可能会消化不良导致似懂非懂。结合例子学习是一个不错的方法，本文就带大家边学边做，通过高仿微博长按点赞的彩虹动画，学习和实践 Compose 动画的相关技巧。

1. Compose 动画 API 概览
Compose 动画 API 在使用场景的维度上大体分为两类：高级别 API 和低级别 API。就像编程语
言分为高级语言和低级语言一样，这列高级低级指 API 的易用性：
高级别 API 主打开箱即用，适用于一些 UI 元素的展现/退出/切换等常见场景，例如常见的 AnimatedVisibility 以及 AnimatedContent 等，它们被设计成 Composable 组件，可以在声明式布局中与其他组件融为一体。
//Text通过动画淡入
var editable by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
AnimatedVisibility(visible &#x3D; editable) {
    Text(text &#x3D; &quot;Edit&quot;)
}

低级别 API 使用成本更高但是更加灵活，可以更精准地实现 UI 元素个别属性的动画，多个低级别动画还可以组合实现更复杂的动画效果。最常见的低级别 animateFloatAsState 系列了，它们也是 Composable 函数，可以参与 Composition 的组合过程。

一、 新的可能性
Google I/O 2022 对于 Flutter 而言，将 休闲游戏 带入了大众的视野。让 Flutter 除了应用开发之外，有了新的可能性。其中作为游戏开发引擎的 Flame ，也为更多人所知晓。说实话，之前我并不怎么看得上 Flame ，无论是官网还是文档，内容都很少，感觉非常小众。我期待着官方可以出一个游戏引擎，但现在看来，官方也倾向于使用 Flame 引擎来开发休闲的 2D 游戏，那我无需再等，开摆 。
【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 壹】开启新世界的大门 (本文)
1. 弹球开源弹球游戏 pinball
在 I/O 2022 中， 官方用 Flutter 写的弹球小游戏，确实让我眼前一亮，开源地址在：【pinball】。这说明基本的碰撞、音乐、动画没有什么问题，用来做休闲小游戏是足够的，我也就没什么好担心的了。

所以，接下来将开启一个系列，研究 Flutter&amp;Flame 的游戏 2D 休闲游戏开发。另外，为了录屏、截图方便，这里主要在 macOS 平台上运行，实现桌面版的 Flutter 游戏。
2. 本文目标
本文作为 Flame 最简使用，相当于一个 Hello World 级别的案例。
项目搭建与资源配置
播放背景音乐
显示如下的人物动作

二、项目搭建
1. 依赖与资源配置
首先在 pubspec.yaml 中引入 flame 和 flame_audio 包。
----&gt;[]----
dependencies:
  #...
  flame: ^1.1.1
  flame_audio: ^1.0.2

然后在根目录下创建 assets 目录，其中图片放在 images 文件夹下，音乐放在 audio 下，并在 pubspec.…</span>

简介
Jetpack Compose 是用于构建原生 Andorid 界面的新工具包，Compose 使用了更少的代码，强大的工具和直观的 Kotlin Api 简化并且加快了 Android 上界面的开发。
在 Compose 中，在构建界面的时候，无需在像之前那么构建 XML 布局，只需要调用 Jetpack Compose 函数来声明你想要的的元素，Compose 编译器就会自动帮你完成后面的工作。
在开始使用 Compose 之前，你需要重新搭建环境，可参考**官方文档**
注解
@Compose
所有的组合函数都必须添加 @Compose 注解才可以。
被 @Compose 注解的方法只能被同类型的方法调用。
@Preview
使用该注解的方法可以不在运行 App 的情况下就可以查看布局。@Preview 中常用的参数如下：
name: String: 为该Preview命名，该名字会在布局预览中显示。
showBackground: Boolean: 是否显示背景，true为显示。
backgroundColor: Long: 设置背景的颜色。
showDecoration: Boolean: 是否显示Statusbar和Toolbar，true为显示。
group: String: 为该Preview设置group名字，可以在UI中以group为单位显示。
fontScale: Float: 可以在预览中对字体放大，范围是从0.01。
widthDp: Int: 在Compose中渲染的最大宽度，单位为dp。
heightDp: Int: 在Compose中渲染的最大高度，单位为dp。

Kubernetes Database Operator is useful for building scalable database servers as a database (DB) cluster. But because you have to create new artifacts expressed as YAML files, migrating existing databases to Kubernetes requires a lot of manual effort. This article introduces a new open source tool named Konveyor Tackle-DiVA-DOA (Data-intensive Validity Analyzer-Database Operator Adaptation). It automatically generates deployment-ready artifacts for database operator migration. And it does that through datacentric code analysis.
What is Tackle-DiVA-DOA?
Tackle-DiVA-DOA (DOA, for short) is an open source datacentric database configuration analytics tool in Konveyo…</span>

In the age of high-speed internet, most large information systems are structured as distributed systems with components running on different machines. The performance of these systems is generally assessed by their throughput and response time. When performance is poor, debugging these systems is challenging due to the complex interactions between different subcomponents and the possibility of the problem occurring at various places along the communication path.
On the fastest networks, the performance of a distributed system is limited by the host&#x27;s ability to generate, transmit, process, and receive data, which is in turn dependent on its hardware…</span>

DuckDuckGo 的搜索主要是基于微软的必应搜索。最近，研究人员发现 DuckDuckGo 手机浏览器并没有阻止第三方网站上的微软追踪器。DuckDuckGo 解释称，微软不知道用户在 DuckDuckGo 上的搜索，DuckDuckGo 浏览器也屏蔽了所有微软的 cookie，但如果你访问了一个含有微软跟踪程序的网站，那么用户的数据将会暴露给必应搜索引擎和领英。DuckDuckGo 称，根据一份保密的微软搜索合作协议要求，他们为了从必应拉取搜索信息必须如此。

荷兰警方制作被害男孩的深度伪造视频，希望获得新线索

在一名少年被谋杀近 20 年后，荷兰警方在使用深度伪造技术将其“复活”后收到了几十条线索。2003 年，一位 13 岁的少年在鹿特丹地铁站的停车场扔雪球时被击毙。这件谋杀案让警方困惑了多年。在其家人的允许下，警方制作了一个视频，在视频中，这位少年请求公众帮助解决这起悬案。荷兰警方认为这可能是世界首例，视频中出现了该少年栩栩如生的形象，并请求知情者提供线索。

                              <span>掌握管理本地/远程分支等最常见的 Git 任务。


Git 的主要优势之一就是它能够将工作“分叉”到不同的分支中。

如果只有你一个人在使用某个存储库，分支的好处是有限的。但是，一旦你开始与许多其他贡献者一起工作，分支就变得必不可少。Git 的分支机制允许多人同时处理一个项目，甚至是同一个文件。用户可以引入不同的功能，彼此独立，然后稍后将更改合并回主分支。那些专门为一个目的创建的分支，有时也被称为主题分支topic branch，例如添加新功能或修复已知错误。

当你开始使用分支，了解如何管理它们会很有帮助。以下是开发者在现实世界中使用 Git 分支执行的最常见任务。

重命名分支

有时候，你或许会错误地命名了一个分支，或者你会想要在内容合并到主分支后，使用同一个分支在不同的错误或任务之间切换。在这种情况下，重命名主题分支就会很有帮助。

重命名本地分支

1、重命名本地分支：

$ git branch -m 
 


当然，这只会重命名你的分支副本。如果远程 Git 服务器上存在该分支，请继续执行后续步骤。

2、推送这个新分支，从而创建一个新的远程分支：

$ git push origin 


3、删除旧的远程分支：

$ git push origin -d -f 



重命名当前分支

当你要重命名的分支恰好是当前分支时，你不需要指定旧的分支名称。

1、重命名当前分支：

$ git branch -m 


2、推送新分支，从而创建一个新的远程分支：

$ git push origin 


3、删除…</span>

                              <span>以下是切换到 Linux sudo 命令的五个安全原因。下载 sudo 参考手册获取更多技巧。


在传统的 Unix 和类 Unix 系统上，新系统中存在的第一个同时也是唯一的用户是 root。使用 root 账户登录并创建“普通”用户。在初始化之后，你应该以普通用户身份登录。

以普通用户身份使用系统是一种自我施加的限制，可以防止愚蠢的错误。例如，作为普通用户，你不能删除定义网络接口的配置文件或意外覆盖用户和组列表。作为普通用户，你无权访问这些重要文件，所以你无法犯这些错误。作为系统的实际所有者，你始终可以通过 su 命令切换为超级用户（root）并做你想做的任何事情，但对于日常工作，你应该使用普通账户。

几十年来，su 运行良好，但随后出现了 sudo 命令。

对于日常使用超级用户的人来说，sudo 命令乍一看似乎是多余的。在某些方面，它感觉很像 su 命令。例如：

$ su root

# dnf install -y cowsay


sudo 做同样的事情：

$ sudo dnf install -y cowsay



它们的作用几乎完全相同。但是大多数发行版推荐使用 sudo 而不是 su，甚至大多数发行版已经完全取消了 root 账户（LCTT 译注：不是取消，而是默认禁止使用 root 用户进行登录、运行命令等操作。root 依然是 0 号用户，依然拥有大部分系统文件和在后台运行大多数服务）。让 Linux 变得愚蠢是一个阴谋吗？

事实并非如此。sudo 使 Linux 更加灵活和可配置，并且没有损失功能，此外还有 几个显著的优点。

为什么在 Linux 上 sudo 比 root 更好？

以下是你应该使用 sudo 替换 su 的五个原因。

1. root 是被攻击确认的对象

@潘誉晗：《桶川跟踪狂杀人事件》

被谋杀了三次的女大学生。
——《桶川跟踪狂杀人事件》的悲剧

阅读这本被誉为 「记者的教科书」「日本纪实文学的金字塔」的这本书的原因，真的就是因为简介写得实在是太有吸引力：「九九九年十月二十六日，年轻女子猪野诗织在日本埼玉县 JR 桶川站前遭人持刀刺死。受害者生前因长期受到跟踪骚扰而多次向警方报案，警方却未予重视，最终没能阻止悲剧的发生。」确实是一段非常棒的阅读过程，作为一部纪实作品，它深刻，却又写得通俗易懂，让人一看就手不释卷，当然，也正是因为这般的一目了然，所以心底便生出了更多的遗憾和气愤。
因为这本是一场可以被阻止的谋杀。
接受记者调查的时候，猪野诗织朋友所的第一句话就是：「诗织是被小松和警方杀死的。」只是这样寥寥几个字，却已经足够令人震惊。原来这一场悲剧，只要警方有所动作，是真的可以避免的。毕竟早在案件发生之前，嫌疑人小松（猪野诗织的前男友）就因为两个人感情的时候叫嚣着要把诗织杀死，担心受怕的一家人选择了团结一心并且积极录音、报警，可当他们一家人去报警的时候，警方并没有采取任何实质性的举措。即使面对嫌疑人越来越猖狂的威胁，无论他们拿出了多少证据，警方也依然不处理，甚至是上门「要求」他们取消报案。如此忽略、漠视受害者生前报案已经让人不能接受的情况下，警方更是在案后企图抹黑受害者，并利用自身的权利掩盖之前渎职的行为：「县警冷酷的反击，终于到了露骨地攻击诗织的地步。读到这些内容，我忍不住呻吟。县警利用诗织的日记，不仅践…</span>

前言
对于特斯拉而言，充电补能是日常使用最为重要的一部分，好的充电体验能大大增加纯电车使用的幸福感。

我之前关于充电体验的分享中，有不少评论对于随车充比较感兴趣，我个人和身边车主也都有不同随车充产品是使用经历，关于固定充电桩和第三方充电桩可以看我已经发布的分享，本篇来专门聊聊随车充！
我的充电方式
先说说我个人用车，目前接近两万公里，在提车的前半段，我基本是使用第三方快充为主，其中包括合计 3000km，也就是 750 度电的特斯拉官方超充，它们大概为我提供了实际5000km 上下的行车里程。

在我安装自己的家充桩之前，商场内的第三方充电站也是为我车辆续航的主力，也因为商场充电普遍可以免 2 小时停车费，我也经常以充一点点电的方式实现免费停车。

去年申请到了 380V 电表，安装好 21kW 充电桩之后，自己的家充桩可以让我下班停好车，设置好 10 点开始充电后，早上顺利满电出门。它会是未来绝大多数时间我的核心补能手段。

而在去年夏天，住的一套老房子可以把车停在楼下，从三楼窗户接延长线下来，使用普诺得 3.5kW 随车充充电，这一方式我也使用了一个多月，随车充也作为未来外出自驾游、去农家乐的补电方式，常驻在了我的后备箱中，不过大家都知道今年的上海，到现在一直没什么出去玩的机会。
随车充的优势与劣势
优点：

便携式充电器，可以随车携带。
不用申请独立电表，只要带电三孔插座就能实现补能。
低功率交流充电，对电池友好。
可作为固定充电桩使用的随车充，价格普遍低于同功率的固定充电桩。

缺点：

大部分使用环境下，充电速…</span>

之前写了一篇《免费的个人博客系统搭建及部署解决方案（Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis）》，讲述了一下我使用 Serverless 和一些开源项目搭建的博客系统，也开了个系列来记录搭建过程。
本篇是关于博客评论系统的解决方案，我最早使用的博客评论系统是万恶的 Disqus，一个笨重且会收集用户隐私的知名评论系统，因为加载比较慢，且免费版本经常会附带一些广告，实在难以忍受，于是换成了另一个基于 GitHub issues 的评论系统 utterances，它会为每篇文章生成一个 issue，将，用户通过授权 GitHub 登录来对 issue 发表评论。这种方式的好处是只需要授权一个 utterances-bot 来进行管理，无需自己部署服务，维护数据库等。但是用了一段时间后，觉得有几点不足：

基于 GitHub API 进行评论管理，如之后接口变动或对这类利用 issue 进行评论的方式进行限制，会不太稳定
读者必须要授权 GitHub 登录，非技术人员或使用移动端阅读的读者使用起来很不方便
会将 GitHub 仓库弄得较乱，也不方便后续迁移到其他系统

经过一番调研 Randy 的 Cusdis 很合我的心意。Cusdis 是一个注重数据隐私的开源的评论系统，十分轻量，经过 gzipped 后大约只有 5kb，从名字来看也知道开发者也是难以忍受 Disqus，自己做了一个替代版，因此它也是支持 Disqus 历史数据导入的，很贴心。
虽然这是一个开发早期的项目，但是已经提供了电子邮件通知以及通过 Webhook 联动 Telegram 等方式进行评论提醒，对使用者来说很方便进行管理。Cusdis 提供了免费托管服务与自行部署两种方式，如果不想折腾可以直接用作者提供的服务。自行部署则需要服务器与一个 Postgre SQL 实例，我们主要示范一…</span>

前言
NDK 全称  Native Development Kit，也就是原生开发工具包 ，官网对它有详细的 中文介绍 。可能一说到 NDK 或 JNI ，大家脑子里第一反应就是集成 C/C++ 。其实 JNI 的含义是 Java Native Interface ，这种接口允许 Java 和其他语言进行交互的，包括但不限于 C/C++ 。目前 Rust 也可以通过 JNI 来和 Java 交互，虽然不太成熟。
其实 NDK 更像一个桥梁，来连通 Java 和其他语言，它是一系列工具的集合。既然作为工具， NDK 并非必须在 Android  项目中才能用。本文我们来通过 NDK 对 FFmpeg 5.0 进行编译，生成动态链接库 so 。

注：本文的 Java 泛指 JVM 语言，不要拿 Kotlin 抬杠，本质太大的区别 。本文测试项目源码地址【TolyFFmpeg】
一、环境准备
想要编译 FFmpeg 应用 Android 中的动态链接库，我们要准备两个东西：一者是 FFmpeg 的源码；二者是 NDK 的工具包。这两者都可以通过简单的下载获得。
1、FFmpeg 源码下载：5.0.1
作为一个开源项目，想得到源码还是非常简单的。可以在官网直接下载源码，也可以通过 git 来下载，或者点击More releases 来选择某个版本进行下载。
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

源码解压如下，里面的 doc 文件夹有些文档和案例，还是比较有用的。其余的东西暂时对我们来说并没有什么太大的意义，现在我们的目的是通过这个源码通过 NDK 来编译成在 Android 中可以使用的动态链接库 so 文件。

我正在参加「初夏创意投稿大赛」详情请看：初夏创意投稿大赛
0x1、引言
对于电商来说，夏天 中最重要的日子莫过于——618大促，看看这类APP的LOGO就知道了~

又是一大波蹲点抢券，各种凑凑凑，签到、关注店铺、加购商品等 价格歧视 策略。
最近某电商刚开展618分19亿的活动，依旧是那些 简单无聊但费阳寿的任务，不薅白不薅，问了群里的小伙伴，貌似还没有脚本：

看了下任务，跟之前打年兽的玩法，不能说是一模一样，可以说是完全一致，不知道读者还记得这篇文章不：《节约&quot;阳寿&quot;——某电商春节炸年兽自动化》，稍微改了一下当时的脚本 (点击区域调整、匹配图片替换)，再次成功解放双手~

不过，虽然能用，但还不够好，小结那里也列出问题了：

其中最大的问题还是，任务判定用了第三方的OCR API，白嫖有次数限制，脚本做不了几天就歇菜了，索性用新的思路重新写一个吧~

0x2、从OCR文本匹配判定 → 图片相似度判定
之前判定执行什么任务的流程：
判断Airtest匹配到的 &quot;去完成&quot; 图标对应的哪个任务描述；
生成屏幕截图，裁剪此任务描述区域；
调用百度OCR提取文本，遍历Task匹配词；
命中Task，点击去完成按钮，并执行后续操作；


简单粗暴，就是每个任务都要消耗一次识别，很快就会达到每个月的白嫖上限。而实际上，任务描述区域这块：

是 固定不变的，完全可以这样做：
定好五个截图的坐标区域；
生成屏幕截图后，裁剪出这五个区域，然后划分判定；
任务判定时，拿要判定的任务区域的截图，进行相似度对比；
大于一个特定值，如0.9，说明是某类任务，然后执行后续操作即可；
① 生成屏幕截图
利用Airtest的截图API生成截图

根据 AOSP（Android 开源项目）上的讨论，小米工程师提议给安卓添加 SELinux 策略以禁止提取 apk 文件，让用户只能通过官方商店或授权网站下载应用，小米的理由是 apk 文件可能含有来自私有来源的数据，比如其中的图像可能会被其他人拿来重复使用。但谷歌拒绝了这一提议。

开发者调查显示对区块链、加密货币和 NFT 有强烈兴趣

根据对两万多名编程人员的调查，SlashData 的 2022 年度开发者调查显示，34% 的开发者表示正在学习加密货币知识，16% 的人表示正在参与加密货币项目；32% 接受调查的开发者表示在了解 NFT 相关知识，11% 的人正参与 NFT 项目。此外 30% 的人正在学习加密货币之外的区块链应用，但仅有 12% 在从事这些区块链项目。

老王点评：抛开各种金融困境不说，我是坚定地认为区块链及加密货币必然有其存在价值，是为未来所打造的基础技术。




将云计算引入机器人操作系统

由于重量和功率要求，机器人的机载计算能力往往受到限制，它们也很少有硬件加速器，如 GPU、TPUS 或 FPGA。但许多机器人算法和最近的进展都得益于高端计算机和硬件加速器。伯克利人工智能研究实验室正在开发开源机器人操作系统 FogROS。他们设想使用云计算来加速缓慢的计算，可以使机器人在相同的时间内做更多的事情。他们已经开放了 FogROS 2 预览版。FogROS 2 将 SLAM 延迟降低了 50%，将抓取规划时间从 14 秒减少到 1.2 秒，并将运动规划速度提高了 28 倍，与替代方案相比 FogROS 2 将网络使用率降低了 3.8 倍。

老王点评：云计算是大脑，而这些机器人就是它的手臂，可以预期将来的机器人会更强大，但是我总有对这种有强大智能的机器人一些恐惧。</span>

When operating on the Linux command line, it is easy to get disoriented, which can have disastrous consequences. I once issued a remove command before realizing that I&#x27;d moved the boot directory of my computer. I learned to use the pwd command to know exactly which part of the file system I was in (and these days, there are command projects, like trashy and trash-cli, that serve as intermediates when removing files).
When I was new to Linux, I had a cheat sheet that hung over my desk to help me remember those commands as I managed my Linux servers. It was called the 101 commands for Linux cheat sheet. As I became more familiar with these commands, I became more profic…</span>

Many organizations have security policies in place that dictate how to store sensitive information. When you&#x27;re developing applications for the cloud, you&#x27;re probably expected to follow those policies, and to do that you often have to externalize your data storage. Kubernetes has a built-in system to access external secrets, and learning to use that is key to a safe cloud-native app.
In this article, I&#x27;m going to demonstrate how to build a Quarkus reactive application with externalized sensitive information—for instance, a password or token—using Kubernetes Secrets. A secret is a good example of how cloud platforms can secure applications by removing…</span>

Android开发中ViewPager+Fragment的懒加载
TabLayout+ViewPager+Fragment是我们开发常用的组合。ViewPager的默认机制就是把全部的Fragment都加载出来，而为了保障一些用户体验，我们使用懒加载的Fragment，就是让我们再用户可见这个Fragment之后才处理业务逻辑。
而我们在一些设备或版本中可能就出现懒加载失效的问题。其实谷歌早就把一些懒加载的方案都标记弃用了，我们一直都用的老的随时会失效的Api。万一哪天彻底失效了就会导致线上事故。
接下来我们就看看Fragment的懒加载是如何演变的。谷歌又是推荐我们如何使用的。
1. Support时代的懒加载
在AndroidX还没出来的时候，大家的懒加载应该都是这样。判断setUserVisibleHint的方法，当用户可见的时候才回调方法去加载逻辑。
例如的我封装：
abstract class BaseVDBLazyLoadingFragment : AbsFragment() {

    protected lateinit var mViewModel: VM
    protected lateinit var mBinding: VDB
    private var isViewCreated &#x3D; false//布局是否被创建
    private var isLoadData &#x3D; false//数据是否加载
    private var isFirstVisible &#x3D; true//是否第一次可见
    protected lateinit var mGLoadingHolder: Gloading.Holder

   …</span>
                            </span>
                          </div>
                        </a>
                      </details>
                    </article>
                </section>
