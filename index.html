本周话题：元宇宙会成功吗
前不久，脸书的老板扎克伯格接受专访。
记者提问，为啥你们公司要改名为 Meta（元宇宙）？

记者的言下之意是，元宇宙这么虚幻的东西，科幻小说家炮制出来的概念。改成这个名字，你们会不会是一时头脑发热，追求时髦，能做成功吗？

扎克伯格的回答很棒，没有说外交辞令，而是说了两个很实在的理由，表明他认真算计过成功的可能性。
他说，根据统计，大多数美国成年人每天看电视（包括流媒体）或者玩电子游戏的时间，长达几个小时。电视节目或电子游戏，本质上都是提供了一个虚拟世界，让观众和玩家脱离现实，感受到快乐。
这表明人们愿意在虚拟世界里面，每天待上几个小时，哪怕现在的体验还非常初级。

第二个理由是，疫情期间，许多人都在家办公。以前，上班的目的地是办公室，现在变成了键盘和显示器。
这表明，人们可以在计算机前面工作8小时。如果能够提供更好的虚拟办公条件，这8小时完全可以在虚拟空间里面度过。

扎克伯格的结论就是，人们愿意待在虚拟世界，进行娱乐和工作。 元宇宙的需求真实存在，而且这种需求很大，只要能够创造更好的体验，就会诞生一个空前的市场。

我被扎克伯格说动了，突然意识到，虚拟世界真的很受欢迎，这是元宇宙可能成功的最大原因。
甚至可以这么说，如果我们把虚拟世界等同于元宇宙，那么可以发现，元宇宙早就成功了。
西游记是元宇宙。
星球大战是元宇宙。…</span>

                    <span>Everything we do is online. We bank online, access healthcare, pay our taxes, build our businesses -  and along the way we put trust in companies to keep us protected.
Unfortunately, companies aren’t great at writing secure software. Contrast Security wants to change that.
Jeff Williams, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Contrast Security, and Steve Wilson, CPO, join the Dev Interrupted podcast to discuss the future of application security (AppSec), the importance of security automation and why the traditional way of doing security - where you scan app after app a few times a year - is over.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



By the numbers: the average application is attacked 13,000 times a month

And has over 35 vulnerabilities

The reasons AppSec should to be automated
How to reduce the cost of AppSec
Why shifting left doesn&#x27;t result in more secure code

Many systems require sending emails to notify users. And testing these notifications manually is a pain. So it&#x27;s one of the best use cases for integration testing. First, let&#x27;s create strongly typed model for our Welcome email:
public class Welcome
{
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}

And we create a Razor template for the email in EmailTemplates/Welcome.cshtml:
@model EmailSnapshotTesting.EmailTemplates.Welcome
@{
    Layout &#x3D; &quot;~/EmailTemplates/_Layout.cshtml&quot;;
}

Welcome @Model.FullName
Welcome to our wonderful service!

And this is how the layout is going to look like in EmaiTemplates/_Layout.cshtml:

                    <span>I&#x27;m planning to start a series of posts showing my first impressions as someone inexperienced in programming who had his first impressions in Python. I&#x27;ll try to post every time I finish studying so that the original feeling is still clear.
While messing around on Discord, I found a discussion about this language and how it was useful in web development. It wasn&#x27;t very long and not all that interesting, but they said something that really caught my attention. 

I really like python and my focus is on web development, so why not try it out?
This thought was what made me start looking for online resources, a task that apparently I&#x27;m not intelligent enough to do, so I asked on Discord.
PHP is a scripting language specialized in web development and that can be embedded inside HTML and is executed on the server, meaning no shady scripts running on the client computer and more freedom working with sensitive data.

PHP can be manually installed by itself, or so I was told, but the easiest way when learning is through those already configured packages, like WAMP, LAMP and XAMPP. People from discord recommended using XAMPP, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with it for now. Having installed it, everything left is understanding how it works.</span>

                    <span>Set up Neovim for Full Stack Development


You&#x27;ll need:
Coc 
emmet
install neovim


Install vim-plug (or any other plugin manager)
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug


I recommend checking out my dotfiles which has lots of comments so you can find any extra features that might be helpful for you.



I will write another post for a more in-depth description of getting started with neovim...
To install Coc, you&#x27;ll want to follow their instructions at the link below. It is 
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
With neovim open, type the following:
:CocConfig coc-html coc-tsserver coc-json coc-emmet  coc-prettier
Coc tsserver is for javascript, typescript, and JSX support
You&#x27;ll want to create a shortcut for :call CocAction(&#x27;format&#x27;). I have the following shortcut so that I can format my projects with space + f:
nnoremap f :call CocAction(&#x27;format&#x27;)
head over to the Node.js downloads page and follow their installation instructions. You can also use your package manager to install Node. 
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo pacman -S nodejs
I highly recommend installing tmux so you can run your frontend, backend, neovim, and git cli in the same terminal window which makes it way easier to keep your workspace clear. Tmux is great because you can name your sessions and easily navigate to the right spot for what you&#x27;re looking to do.</span>

                    <span>I planned how to contribute to an open source project last week and wrote about it in my previous blog. In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!
For the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I&#x27;ve decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college&#x27;s C language course notes. The issue I&#x27;m working on is about &quot;Standardize frontmatter across all pages&quot;. When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.
I&#x27;ve done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:
Added id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages
Each property of frontmatter was unified in order
Unified format of description
Shortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the  inside the 
tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)
Added &quot;Standardize frontmatter&quot; to the CONTRIBUTING.md file
PR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143




  
  
  Getting reviews and change requests


One of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo&#x27;s owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I&#x27;m familiar with the course notes, but I wasn&#x27;t very good at C language.
The goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn&#x27;t change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.</span>

                    <span>TLDR


Responsible AI uses AI to empower individuals and put people’s values first. Its ethical deployment is essential to fight against algorithmic bias.
Intro
What is Responsible AI?
Steps for Responsible AI
Responsible AI in practice
The rapid development of AI will have a big impact on nearly every aspect of private and professional life. The determination of that impact’s success should be judged by how ethically and responsibly the technology is created. With laws not being able to keep up with the pace that AI is being developed, it falls on companies and developers to make a responsible product.

The power of AI is in its ability to be deployed quickly across the world; however, this could also be AI’s greatest threat, as algorithms can spread bias on a massive scal…</span>

                    <span>We&#x27;re going to go over three of the logical operators that Javascript uses:



The benefit of a logical operator is to connect two (or more!) expressions so that the value of the total (all of the expressions you just connected) is dependent on those expressions. 
These operators are used within code to compare variables and values when creating various logic methods, often using their boolean values. When used within functions it gives more logic options for the code to use and change based on user behavior. This can also help DRY up code in condensing functions.
The NOT ! operator is generally used as a boolean. Logical NOT will have truthy value if the operator it&#x27;s called on (like !(6 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) is false and vice-versa (like !(6 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 6) is considered a false value. Here&#x27;s a different way of…</span>

                    <span>Managing Dependencies with go.mod


A project&#x27;s dependencies are declared in the go.mod file. This is where the modules are stored when you do go get . You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. 
When you clone a Go project from github, for example, you&#x27;ll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you&#x27;re coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. 
You may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn&#x27;t have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project&#x27;s go.mod file. 
For example:
github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn&#x27;t have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc. You would then have github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc // indirect in your project&#x27;s go.mod file. 
note: the above is a hypothetical scenario, you won&#x27;t actually have any indirect dependencies with github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2
go.sum includes the checksum for the dependencies to make sure that you&#x27;re installing the exact same dependency as the author used. 
To create a new Go project where you can have a go.mod file, you need to set it up on your GOPATH with a name for your project. 
Running go mod init 
You need to run go mod init before you&#x27;re able to get dependencies for your project with go get</span>

                    <span>Hey there, my name is Tiago and I am the host of Wannabe Entrepreneur (a podcast about what it&#x27;s like to bootstrap a company).  
The great thing about having a podcast is that I have an &quot;excuse&quot; to ask questions to people I admire and want to learn from!
Recently I got to interview Cassidy Williams (@cassidoo
) and she has more than 170K followers on Twitter!! I won&#x27;t lie, I was quite nervous... But she was super nice and the interview went really well.
Here are the top 3 things I learned from Cassidy:
1- Be humble and genuine
2- Some companies want access to your social media
she keeps all the control over her social media. With more than 170K followers I guess that many companies could use it for personal marketing...
3- Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment
that rule is BS! Cassity was never afraid to leave a job where she was not happy and that gave her the opportunity to experiment with different types of companies and find which ones she prefers to work at.
These are just 3 of a lot of lessons I took from my casual chat with Cassidy Williams. Would love to hear your thoughts on the interview. What questions did I miss? You can listen to the full chat here</span>

                    <span>What is Conductor


Conductor is a Microservices orchestration platform from Netflix, released under Apache 2.0 Open Source License.
jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.
Conductor allows you to create tasks that can process JSON payloads in your workflows without writing custom code using jq.  
JSON is a popular format of choice for data-interchange. It is widely used in web and server applications, document storage, API I/O etc. It’s also used within Conductor to define workflow and task definitions and passing data and state between tasks and workflows. This makes a tool like JQ a natural fit for processing task rel…</span>

.NET provides a Syntax API that can read any C# or Visual Basic source file and provide the corresponding Syntax Tree for that code.
Why would someone need to traverse the C# syntax tree?
Well, it can be for a number of reasons, maybe you want to gather statistics about how many classes, namespaces and methods you have, maybe you want generate code based on what is already written, maybe you want to create new tools like a new linter or a tool like Swagger. All these things can be done by analyzing the syntax tree.

                    <span>Markdown (MD) 是现在最流行的文档书写语言格式，用户只需一些非常「简单易记」的语法就能写出一篇具有良好排版和可读性的文章，因此大受欢迎，渐渐已成为互联网写作的新潮流。
而 Markdown 写作语法非常简单易上手，譬如两个星号包围文字可实现**加粗效果**，_斜体_，三个减号- - -输出一条分割线等。在写作时打字跟排版能一气呵成，配合 Typora、MWeb 等高效的写作软件，熟练后行云流水的输入绝对让你有抛弃 Word 之类“重量级”软件的冲动……

一、主要功能介绍
复制摘录：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发，复制摘录文字或图片，支持多选后批量触发，支持文档模式下点击摘录使用，双击改为复制标题，配合快贴使用可以检测到多个复制信息（包括文本和图片）
欧陆词典：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发，或选中文字后点击按钮触发，自动调用欧路词典查询单词或翻译句子
标题摘录转化：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发，支持多选，也支持文档模式下点击摘录后触发
MD Link：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发￼￼，自动复制为markdown链接格式，文字为卡片标题，链接为该卡片url，无标题则显示为notitle，支持多选后复制，也支持文档模式下点击摘录后触发，双击复制为纯URL
二、 迷你模式
该插件支持在标准与迷你模式间切换，迷你模式下仅显示为一列图标，点击图标后触发的功能与标准模式下一致


IMG_09012732×2048 611 KB


三、其它设置
垂直位置调整：
可将插件面板上下移动以满足需求
位置切换：
点击后会在三种位置上切换（屏幕左侧，文档与脑图分界线，屏幕右侧）
位置跟随：
启动该模式后，会根据手指位置自动选择合适的高度和屏幕位置，以达到方便点击的目的（ps：mn的文档定位有bug，所以这功能并不是很好用）
是否贴边：
关闭贴边则会与屏幕边缘留下一点距离，以免挡住mn插件面板或手写工具栏
四、技术说明
插件基于CopySearch和ohmymn开发，并集成了SwitchTitle、SearchInEudic等功能，主要在其基础上增加了一些功能，比如复制为Markdown格式的链接，选中文字后即可点击调用欧路词典来查词和翻译，复制摘录功能可主动识别并复制摘录图片或摘录文本。理念是在尽量不遮挡屏幕的情况下（迷你模式）通过点击触发每个动作而不是自动触发（这样容易误触发）。
五、更新日志
version：1.1.0
OneClick_1.1.0.mnaddon (20.4 KB)
更新“复制摘录”功能的批量触发，更新双击“复制摘录”按钮会额外复制卡片标题的功能
更新双击“MD Link”按钮会复制纯链接的功能
切换文档后页面不会关闭

                    <span>Hi！MarginNote 团队又与大家见面啦！
今天是世界备份日（World Back Up Day），在这个由 Reddit 发起的，愚人节前一天的，口号为“别做愚人，备份你的数据“的节日里，我们将和大家分享你可以如何利用 5 道防线，保护你 MarginNote 中的数据安全，避免成为一个愚人～
请耐心看到最后，文末有福利哦。
一，历史存档——自动化的抵御大部分常规风险
便捷性：
安全性：
历史存档是 MarginNote 中内置的一个“时光照相机”，你可以利用它来保存某一时刻某笔记本的状态。如出现了误操作，你可以通过历史存档，打开之前的笔记。必要之时，还可以双开MarginNote，进行文档的对比。
它操作简单，同时也节省存储空间。通过历史存档给一个 300 MB 的脑图笔记本“拍照”，只会占用 8 MB 左右的空间。是不是很厉害？
不过，历史存档也有无能为力的地方。存档的数据仅被会被保存在本地，因而它只能应对本设备出现的误操作、同步冲突等问题。如果设备丢失或者损坏，那么你将无法恢复重要的笔记数据了:-(


d3a955ea-4c98-4e1d-aecd-e5c1ec63ff411366×1024 635 KB


二，高频笔记本独立备份——最常用且最可靠的保护之道
便捷性：
安全性：
在 iCloud 云同步和历史存档之外，在每完成一个阶段的记录后，你还可以考虑把重要的笔记本单独导出，进行备份。这种方式非常安全，而且十分灵活。这样，就算出现了系统 bug 或者是误操作，你重要的数据也不会受到影响。
你可以在很多的地方存储笔记本备份：你可以选择上传至百度网盘、通过 QQ 分享给好友、或者是存储到本地文件之中。每多存储一个地方，你的数据也就多了一层保险。


2021-03-31 20.22.031600×1200 4.07 MB


三，iCloud 云同步——刀尖上的舞者
便捷性：
安全性：
严格来讲，iCloud 云同步并不是一种增加数据安全的方法。由于笔记本数据可以在多地访问，不小心就有可能造成数据冲突，甚至造成笔记丢失。但是，它最大的缺点也是它的最大的优点：笔记会被同步到云端，因而就算一个设备彻底丢失，你也可以在其他设备上找到你珍贵的笔记。
在利用了可靠的云端存储之外，iCloud 云同步相比于其他的备份方式，在使用起来也十分方便。只需在 MarginNote 中打开 iCloud 云同步，你就可以轻松享受数据多设备同步等诸多好处。但值得注意的是，如果你正在进行非常重要的考试，关闭iCloud将是更稳妥的选择。
自动历史存档就是为iCloud同步的潜在问题而生的，历史存档会在检测到大量笔记变化时自动进行。


2021-03-31 20.17.361600×1200 6.1 MB


四，全局备份——需要数据线拷贝却最令人安心的庞然大物
便捷性：
安全性：
如果你想要一次性备份所有的文档与笔记，你可以选择全局备份。这听起来很费事，但实际上只需要几秒钟，MarginNote 就能轻松导出全局所有文档与笔记的备份。之后，你便可以把文件压缩并上传至百度网盘，或者存储在你认为安全的地方。


2021-03-31 20.23.161600×1200 5.32 MB


五，iCloud云备份——最后的救命稻草
便捷性：
安全性：
iCloud 云备份是通过苹果的 iCloud 备份对 MarginNote 的完整数据库和文档的备份。你可以在 iOS 或者 iPadOS 的系统设置中进行设置。在 iCloud 设置中，打开备份之后，在管理 iCloud 存储空间界面里，点按备份，并选择当前设备。在这里面，你可以打开 MarginNote 对应的开关。开启后，你的 iPad 会在接通电源并且有互联网连接时，自动把数据备份到 iCloud 之中。
这种方式操作复杂，同时恢复也很麻烦。但是，它非常的安全，能够帮助你在设备丢失、MarginNote 数据库崩溃的情况下，找回自己珍贵的笔记。

后记
在过去，我们 MarginNote 的客服团队帮助了不少丢失笔记的小伙伴们找回了他们的笔记。然而，巧妇难为无米之炊，良好的备份习惯是防止笔记丢失最佳的方式。今天是世界备份日，我们希望大家能够养成定期备份笔记的好习惯。
为了大家自己的数据安全，也为了让更多人看到如何更好地保护 MarginNote 中的数据，仔细阅读本文，在评论中抽取一位小伙伴们获得 MarginNote 3 iOS 版兑换码 + OCR Pro 兑换码一套。
希望大家永远都不要丢失数据～</span>

                    <span>从十月份开始，下半年购物季就拉开了帷幕。作为一个购物季扎堆的半年，不知道你有没有注意到这样的一个现象：我们彼此之间互相交流买买买、一起吐槽各路平台与商家套路的时候总是穿杂着一个话题—— 「XX 肯定在偷听我们说话，它广告推送的就是我们那天讨论的」。实际上，这是一个老生常谈的话题。抛开双十一这个特定的时间点，即便是在其他时候我们也能够听到类似的吐槽。
一说到「偷听」，人们马上就会想到隔墙有耳，两只耳朵竖起来的状态。过往的那些不美好的人生经验就会随之浮现并不断提醒自己提高警惕性。这种源自内心深处的不安让我们感到害怕。在马斯洛的需求层次理论当中，安全的需要是仅次于生理的。所以我们很自然地就会给予高度的关注。
荣格与共时性，图片来自维基百科
1920 年代，瑞士心理学家荣格提出了「共时性」的概念。荣格认为：

这些表面上无因果关系的事件之间有着非因果性、有意义的联系，这些联系通常取决于人的主观经验。人总是对巧合印象深刻。

不过，有时候仔细的考量一下，似乎广告推送的也并不总是那么准。这种「偷听」会不会又是一种巧合呢？就是说，App 推送的内容与我们工作与生活中遇到的一些事情恰巧重叠在一起，我们根据自身的人生经验将他们联系到了一起。我们所在意地精准推送又会不会像荣格的共时性中讲的那样？
那么，这些被吐槽的平台到底是否在偷听我们说话？或者更进一步讲，它们是否通过偷听我们说话，进而进行分析并精准广告推送呢？
通过手机「偷听」说话，进行精准推送的可能性有多大？
就单纯的技术而言，手机偷听其实并不是一件很难的事情，但同时，它也并不是一件很容易的事情。究竟通过「偷听」来进行精准的广告推送的可能性有多大，我们逐一往下看。
一般来讲手机悄悄地进行录音通常包括两种情况：一种是（用户授权后的）后台静默监听，一种是突破系统权限进行监听。
对于前者，App 通过静默在后台进行偷听的技术难度大，手机自带的操…</span>

🎁 十二月 Pixel Feature Drop

作为 Pixel 用户，除了 Google 第一方待遇的系统更新支持，另一个众所周知的好处就是你的手机还能随着每个季度发布的 Pixel Feature Drop 收到更多新功能，即便是较早发布的设备往往也不例外。
本周，十二月份的 Pixel Feature Drop 正式开始面向现有 Pixel 手机推送，加入了一系列新功能，也包括对现有 Bug 的修复。
除了 Google 与宝马合作为 Pixel 6 系列新增的车钥匙功能之外，Pixel 6 Pro 还在本次更新之后启用了 UWB 超宽频功能，但目前只能用于提升 Nearby Share 就近分享功能的识别速度。
另一个本次新增功能是用于帮助听障困难者在嘈杂环境下对话的应用 Sound Amplifier：它可以使用手机的机器学习算法来自动过滤掉除对话内容之外的环境噪声：只需要在对话前将手机摄像头对准你与之交谈的对象并选取，放下手机之后便可以在嘈杂环境下正常对话，尽可能地降低外部噪音给听障用户带来的沟通困难。

基于离线模型识别附近播放歌曲的「Now Playing」功能也得到增强：Pixel 4 系列用户现在也可以将本地模型无法正确识别的歌曲手动上传至云端数据库来识别；同时也可以直接将识别出的歌曲标记为喜欢方便后续整理。

                    <span>就像我之前一直说的，即便是电动车，也一样拥有驾驶乐趣，特别是在优秀的调校加持下，更是如此。
作为一个小马力前驱车驾驶员，能得出这样的结论，跟我前不久驾（bai）驶（嫖）的一台车有很大关系，那就是小鹏的P7高性能版，那期节目相信很多人都还有印象。

1.底盘结构影响操控感
其实，要搞懂这个问题，我们最先该聊的，根本就不是动力形式，而最重要的东西，是底盘设计。
什么样的底盘才是“键盘值最高”或者说比较理想的结构呢？这个问题可能问100个人会有100种答案，但是放心，其中出镜率最高的，绝对是两种，双叉臂和多连杆。考虑到造车理念，成本还有布置空间等一系列的问题，现在市面上能见到的，“最具键盘值”的底盘结构非前双叉臂后多连杆莫属了。

保时捷确实前桥使用的麦弗逊，但是人家的调校功力和开发预算并非常规厂家能比的，因此它的厉害并不影响我们以上的结论。

这个结构市场上确实不算是很多见，但是其实有这么几款电动车都用了这个结构，像特斯拉Model 3、小鹏P7、蔚来ET7等这些车型。



而且在使用这个结构的同时，基本上都顺手把能用铝合金的部件都用上了铝合金。这其实跟这些“新势力”厂商开发新车基本上都没有上代车型有很大关系，我要是造车从零开始的话，我肯定也会选择用一个至少从理论上要表现更好的结构啊。


2.调校也很重要
结构不错是个基础，但是接下来的调校也是一关考验，就好像一个钢琴，再是好牌子，调音师是个业余的门外汉，出来的产品也并不会非常优秀的。都说保时捷造车造的好，开着感受好，其实，里面不光是投资，更是有着一个优秀且专业的团队在背后默默付出。什么？你说养不起这么大的团队？那好办，保时捷旗下的保时捷工程公司能够随时成为你的供应商，帮你调车。

没错，保时捷旗下有这么一家名为保时捷工程的公司，这家公司的技术团队有保时捷工程是的实力，这个团队不造车，但是会参与到有需求的厂家的造车过程中，也…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计师Calvin。大约2010年，我有幸涉足了DNF、QQ炫舞、疾风之刃、QQ飞车等产品的影视宣传，随即便入了游戏行业的坑，直奔琳琅天上工作室（也就是现在的天美），开启了我十年的游戏美术设计生涯。
作为老飞车玩家，秉持着对飞车的喜爱，这十年来，我一直从事QQ飞车的制作。从起初的端游场景赛道设计，到现在端/手游双端场景设计、IP包装、CG........每一个环节都留下了我努力搬砖的身影。
工作之余，我喜欢画画、模玩、游戏，也喜欢旅游，因此看到这个话题，我想我可以简单地向大家分享一下我的观点。
先说结论，我认为游戏是有潜力带动旅游业的，尤其是在疫情隔离的影响之后，如何鼓励人们从宅在家，到有意愿出去散心走走，一个好的办法，就是让大家在游戏中去看见，甚至体验旅游景地的美好风景与人文温度。
身为休闲赛车游戏《QQ飞车手游》的美术负责人，近几年我们一直在尝试将游戏与现实中的景点结合，比如今年我们与四川省旅游宣传促进中心合作，在游戏里推出了“梦回古蜀”与“云游天府”两条全新赛道，去一站式、沉浸式地呈现现实中的三星堆博物馆与四川的人文风貌。

“梦回古蜀”赛道展示的“古”，是四川的历史沉淀。玩家驾车驶入庞大的三星堆博物馆，在曲折幽暗的地宫回廊中穿梭，一路经过巨大的青铜立人像与太阳神鸟，去丈量和感受那神秘厚重的古蜀文明，体验一种冒险感。




与之相比，“云游天府”赛道则展现的是“今”，是四川的现代生活。在乐山大佛的脚下，坐卧着岁月静好的山城，有川剧变脸、蜀绣隽美、熊猫嬉闹，也有火锅串串的飘香、麻将的热闹、宽窄巷子的风情，体验一种安逸巴适，人间烟火的生活氛围。




在社交平台和部分随机问卷调查中，有不少玩家称赞了四川主题赛道的设计，并希望我们推出更多地域文化与传统文化的联名赛道，并为自己的家乡打call。这确实让我们感到十分欢喜，也认定“游戏”与“文化旅游…</span>

顺便 @没有文化的俗人 《街球江湖》漫画的编剧一起～回忆下这段痛并快乐着的日子呗～

2021/12/8     追加评论：
谢邀， 其实之前就想写写《街球江湖》的事，但每次提笔便放下，这真是个很难回答到问题：有太多想说的，关于创作本身，关于对行业的看法，关于一直以来我们团队所奉行的模式理念这些，但每次都是千头万绪无法找到开头的感觉。
直到上上周看到这个问题，忽然脑海中就崩出来上面那段总结，花了两周时间顺着上面这个思路重新捋了一下自己对《街球江湖》的看法



                               part1: 《街球江湖》是一部在慢慢变好看的漫画
创作背景
每次提到《街球江湖》创作，它的诞生背景总是个无法绕开的话题 —— 街球连载以来在读者中得到了很多好评，但客观来讲，从专业角度看，这部作品还存在很多不足。尽管如此，我也无论如何也想让大家知道，在它诞生但背后有一个为之倾注来了极大热情与专注，无论怎样都想让它变得更好的团队在不断滴努力。
街球项目起始于17年夏天，彼时我正经历第一次漫画创业的低谷，寄予厚望的《超级绿》因为资方战略调整而无奈终止，和助理们搬进朋友公司的二楼小隔间里，一边安抚大家一边寻找新项目。 
一个朋友发来一个漫画项目的委托问我有没有兴趣：一家影视公司想做篮球ip，提供剧本，找团队做成漫画。 


接下这个项目的原因有三个：
1. 篮球主题：可能是我的一厢情愿，我总认为自己可能是国漫圈里最适合制作篮球漫画的作者之一（实在是太不要脸来），也急需一部能炫技和展现实力的与众不同的漫画来东山再起。
2. 影视公司为开发篮球ip而制作漫画：对方影视公司希望先以漫画形式把故事内容展现给大众并获取一定影响力和观众反馈。这种在早期就开始…</span>

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape &#x27;Life B4 Fame&#x27; with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.</span>

                    <span>This month, return to the sands of Tatooine. The Book of Boba Fett, an all-new Original series, starts streaming December 29 on @DisneyPlus.

“The Book of Boba Fett,” a thrilling Star Wars adventure teased in a surprise end-credit sequence following the Season 2 finale of “The Mandalorian,” finds legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett and mercenary Fennec Shand navigating the galaxy’s underworld when they return to the sands of Tatooine to stake their claim on the territory once ruled by Jabba the Hutt and his crime syndicate.

 

“The Book of Boba Fett” stars Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen. Jon Favreau, Dave Filoni, Robert Rodriguez, Kathleen Kennedy and Colin Wilson are the executive producers. Karen Gilchrist and Carrie Beck serve as co-executive producers, with John Bartnicki producing and John Hampian as co-producer.

                    <span>The protocol that powers the web is known as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A connection can exist between the two programs to send and receive data. 
A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers. Networks have to follow these rules to successfully transmit data.
Python provides a library called sockets to make connections and communicate data between connections.

Sometimes I find my models cluttered with a lot of things: relationships, attributes casting, scopes, custom methods, etc. 
When this happens, one thing I like to do is move my scopes in a dedicated builder. This post will show you how I do that. 
We are working with bunnies because cats are all over the place already and because of the pressure I get from Coton the Tige. 🐰

Let&#x27;s spin up our artisan command to create the model with the migration flag (-m) and the factory flag (-f):
php artisan make:model Bunny -mf

Now let&#x27;s define the data structure of our fleecy table (gist):
Schema::create(&#x27;bunnies&#x27;, function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;id();
    $table-&gt;string(&#x27;n…</span>

                    <span>Dashboards are great for visualization and keeping track of what&#x27;s going on. Managing a repository for a team can be cumbersome and keeping a track of all the pull requests even so. One potential solution could be the dashboard, dashboards are great for visualization and keeping track of what&#x27;s going on. 
In this article, we will discuss how to create a Github Pull Requests Dashboard using ReactJS and Material UI.
Setting up React
Let&#x27;s begin by creating a boilerplate using the create-react-app
npx create-react-app github-pr-dashboard

Install Material UI
We will be using Material UI as a UI library. It boosts up the speed of development as we won&#x27;t have to manually write CSS.
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

                    <span>Somewhere buried in my dusty basement lives a signed copy of Dan Cederholm&#x27;s classic book Bulletproof Web Design. I purchased it during my first trip to An Event Apart in 2007. This book meant a lot to me back then, and almost 15 years later, many of its concepts still hold true.
The premise of the book is that designs should be &quot;bulletproof&quot; to accommodate the many ways they can be used.
I&#x27;m using the term bulletproof partly to describe flexibility—in other words, designs for the web that can easily accommodate various text sizes and amounts of content, designs that expand or contract along with whatever is placed within them.
I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for many years. More recently, my focus has been on building design systems. Although a lot has changed on the World Wide Web over the…</span>

                    <span>Doka is a Russian web developer&#x27;s newest open-source handbook. We are new, so we had to create our workflow from scratch. We are demanding labels users, and we can hook you up too!
When a project has a sophisticated multi-stage review process, the workflow quickly goes out of hand - pull requests get lost, and the review time grows, leading to unhappy contributors.
For example, In Doka&#x27;s case, we have four sections of our website, each with a dedicated editor: HMTL, CSS, JS, and tools. On top of that, there is a responsible for demos, an illustrator, and a publishing editor. We wanted to have one place where they can go to understand what job is pending.

                    <span>Introduction


If you run Node in production, sooner or later you&#x27;ll come across a common bug known as a memory leak.
This was the case with my current side project, expose. I wrote a popular article Six Ways To Drastically Boost Your Productivity As A Node Developer which mentioned it, then suddenly the server was overloaded.
During the period of high load, I could see that a memory leak was forming.
expose?


expose is a command line app that makes its simple to give a public URL to any web based app you have running locally on your machine. So if you have a local API runnig at http://localhost:8000 and you then run expose 8000, it will generate a public URL that you can then share.
It works by creating a websocket connection between the client and the expose service, which listens with …</span>

Summary: Make your toy web apps more robust and manageable by following the Twelve-Factor App methodology.
This is the second part in a series of posts detailing the 12 Factor App. In the last post we looked at:
Your codebase and made it deployable across different environments
Dependencies and why they’re important in reproducibility
Configuration files and how to make them useful across different environments
Backing services, what they are and how decoupling gives your app more flexibility
If you need a refresher or aren’t familiar with the above already, take a look at the last post. Many of the earlier concepts are used as building blocks for the concepts in this post.

I believe I am not the only who has read tens of express guides and never really found the perfect way of implementing it.
In fact, I am confident to say that every Node.js developer has read at least 5 to 6 different guides on writing Express applications. How to make it work is not really a problem nowadays. However, have you ever asked yourself what is the right way to do it? 
With that in mind, I decided to create a boilerplate that would summarize all the best practices used nowadays in the software industry, ensuring reliability, maintainability and scalability. This is what Bulletproof Express tries to accomplish. These are the features currently provided:

Why pay a translator or purchase an expensive translation app when you can build an effective multilingual translator with python in 5 minutes?
Going furthermore, we’ll make this translator even more fun by adding a text to speech capability to it. This will also make it easy for one to use this translator to learn a new language. Sounds interesting right?
Talk is cheap..I know right? Well then let’s get down to the business of the day. To build this amazing translator with python, we’ll be needing a few python modules:

                    <span>2021-2022 的秋季校招又拉开了帷幕。在今年的秋招中，我依然作为业务条线代表参与了全职和暑假实习生的简历筛选、面试和终选的全过程。这几年来，我都会在四季度集中经手两百余份简历。作为一个面试官，我每年都会为不少面试者扼腕叹息：从简历上我可以看得出申请人资质非常不错，但是他/她却不经意间犯了一个或多个「小错误」，导致最后我不得不忍痛割爱。而且，这些错误往往不会在常见的简历教程中提到。
在展开下文之前，我还是想强调一下：简历是非常个性化的产物，因人而异，因公司、岗位、行业而异，切不可一概而论。本文旨在从一家金融机构面试官的角度讨论类似行业的简历「避坑指南」，仅供参考。
你的简历在第一关会经历什么
申请者在网站上提交申请资料之后，人力资源部（HR） 会在网申临近结束或结束以后将资料全部导出，并进行第一步筛选。第一步筛选一般由电脑自动完成，主要确保申请者符合岗位的基本要求（如毕业年度、学历、材料是否齐全等）。如果有在线测试（如 SHL）的话，HR 也会设置一条分数线进行初步筛选。但从多年的经验来看，在线测试的分数线更像是一条及格线（比如 60 分），并不会过于苛刻。
在初步筛选之后，所有的网申材料都会打包提交给业务部门进行第二轮的筛选。这第二轮的筛选就是由业务经理进行的人工筛选了。一般我们会以简历为主，结合网申材料、开放式问题、在线测试成绩和近两年新增的视频回答进行一轮筛选，并给申请人分为三类：Yes、No、Maybe。在每一位的申请材料都审阅完毕后，我们会先考虑各个面试官手中标明 Yes 的应聘者，然后综合讨论所有的待定应聘者，填补剩余的面试席位。
在之后每一轮的面试、活动当中，之前所有的材料（包括网申、简历、以及每一轮评审的评论）都会一起交给下一轮的面试官。在这当中，简历又是每一轮面试官在见到本人之前，最直接了解应聘者的机会。因此，简历的重要性不言而喻。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70331">

                    <span>众所周知，去年的 macOS Big Sur 再一次更新了视觉设计风格，其中一项改动就是「焕然一新」的工具栏。至于焕然一新在哪……最明显的地方就是更大的额头。

这样的设计好不好看见仁见智，但有一点是肯定的：这么多的空间如果浪费就太可惜了。 以文件管理器 Finder 为例，尽管系统已经提供了一系列功能图标来充实工具栏，但仍不一定能满足我们的要求。
实际上，Finder 一直以来都允许用户向工具栏添加任意文件夹、文件或者应用程序图标。 这项功能宣传得很少，但实用性很强，在「大额头」设计的今天更是显得尤其应景。
至于方法，也极其简单，按住 Command ⌘ 键，然后将任何文件夹、文件或者应用程序的图标拖拽到想要安放的位置，松手即可。

通过这种方法添加到工具栏中的文件夹和应用，在功能上类似于 Dock 中的图标，兼有「传送门」和「篮子」两种功能，换言之：

如果直接点击，则可以打开对应的文件夹或启动应用程序
如果将某个文件图标拖动到图标上，则可以将该文件移动到对应的文件夹内，或用对应的应用程序打开该文件。

由于工具栏的「区位优势」，通过这种方法适当添加常用文件夹和应用图标，可以有效减少在整理、编辑文件时需要拖动鼠标的距离，优化操作效率。
如果想让工具栏排布显得更有序，还可以在工具栏空白处点击右键，选择「自定义工具栏」，然后拖拽添加一些「间隙」，为图标建立视觉上的分组效果。
个人而言，我习惯在工具栏添加「桌面」和「下载」文件夹图标，这样可以随时切换到这两个常用位置或将文件移动过去；应用程序图标则添加了 VS Code 和 iTerm 2，以便快速以纯文本形式查看文件，或者切换到命令行环境继续操作。
如果在添加图标后想要重新调整顺序，可以再次按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标拖动。如果想要删除已添加的图标，按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标将图标扔出工具栏即可。</span>

                    <span>鸭屎香、狗浇尿、鸡屎藤，没错这些可都是美食

最近，平地刮起一阵“鸭屎”风。一款叫“鸭屎香”的茶异军突起，突然横扫了大大小小奶茶店的菜单。
某些头部奶茶品牌直接玩起“花活儿”，把一系列“鸭屎香”做底的奶茶丢进菜单。C位的鸭屎香宝藏茶包装更叫勇猛，“鸭屎香”三个硕大的黑字印在橙色的纸杯上，旁边还此地无银地注明“我真的很香”。


微博上，话题“鸭屎香奶茶到底有多好喝”快被网友玩坏了。有的网友秉持考据精神，发帖称“帮你们试过了，没有鸭屎味”；有的则随性表示“鸭屎香真好喝，我又激情下单了”。


这款顶着“鸭屎”之名的茶到底是什么？它所代表的“名称劝退”派食物在中国是一个隐藏的狠人派别，各种硬核气味、诡异生物在这个门派中争奇斗艳。敢不敢上车来一波？


战胜鸭屎香，
还有一堆来自洪荒的气味在等你
鸭屎香的走红，一半以上的功劳来自“鸭屎”二字，猎奇的名字是打开年轻人心扉的钥匙，但鸭屎香，它到底是鸭屎味，还是香味？


鸭屎香到底是什么味？
鸭屎香名字虽野，却正儿八经出身名门，是潮汕茶叶大族凤凰单枞的直系。凤凰单枞产于潮州凤凰山附近，是乌龙江湖里出了名的耐冲泡、强回甘、香气高扬，江湖人称“茶中香水”，香到经常被误会加了香精的那种。

甚至有粉丝放过狠话：“铁观音‘七泡有余香’就让人津津乐道了，而凤凰单枞茶，你完全可以把前七泡直接倒掉！连最普通的凤凰单枞都可以冲十二泡以上。”算你狠！
凤凰单枞甚至直接用香型来命名品种，只要在市面上看到什么黄枝香、芝兰香、蜜兰香、桂花香、肉桂香、茉莉香，那都是凤凰一族的。
从这种意义上来说，鸭屎香还真的没有虚假宣传，它是真的香。

至于为什么以“鸭屎”命名，流行的说法有两种。一说它引进后种在“鸭屎土”（即黄土壤）上；二说因为当地人喝过之后都说好，茶农怕被人偷去，便丑化命名，谎称这叫鸭屎香。

鸭屎香虽然不是最老的品种，但这些年在凤凰家族里已小有名气。它易…</span>

                    <span>被子弹击穿的水壶
急救包、绷带、医疗剪……在展柜中依次整齐排列。


它们曾属于同一个人：年轻的卫生员贠宝山。


紧挨着医疗剪，一只金属水壶静静安放，壶身上浑圆的弹孔，铭刻着一段浸透血色的往事。


1951年秋天，抗美援朝战场上，炮火连绵，鲜血浸染了中马山的泥土。贠宝山穿过硝烟，抚摸一具具失去声息的身体，找寻还存活的战友救治。


战斗胶着，敌人动用了大量飞机火炮，向战场上倾泻数万吨炮弹，呛人的烟尘弥漫在阵地之上，携着火光的弹头肆无忌惮地穿梭飞射，贠宝山远远望见几十米外，班长倒在地上。


枪林弹雨，火光冲天。这短短几十米想要越过去，却难过万水千山。


就在此时，一颗炮弹猝不及防在贠宝山身旁爆炸，他一瞬间晕了过去。


等贠宝山恢复意识时，他的肠子已经顺着鲜血流到地上……


那场战斗中，贠宝山用尽最后的力气，挣扎着爬到班长身边，想要拿起水壶喂水时，却发现那只水壶早就被子弹击穿，里面的水几乎流尽。贠宝山就握着这个被击穿的水壶，永远遗憾地合上了双眼。


展柜里，被封存的水壶早已洗去血痕，或许只有斑驳的磨痕和凹凸的表面，还残留着那段烽火岁月的印记。


一旁展板上，短短数十字介绍，铭刻了一个年轻生命的终点。黑白图案定格了贠宝山的面容。照片上那个圆脸稚嫩的年轻人，牺牲于22岁的秋日——


1951年9月7日，中马山战斗中，志愿军第42军第125师第375团9连卫生员贠宝山奋勇抢救伤员，负伤后坚持不下火线，因伤势过重牺牲。立特等功，授“一级英雄”荣誉称号。


2020年10月，为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战70周年，中国人民革命军事博物馆举办主题展览，将贠宝山的故事和那只水壶纳入其中。


2020年11月，抗美援朝纪念馆网站中，一位名叫贠佳峰的网友在线上烈士名录中找到了贠宝山的名字，留言道：“致敬英雄！致敬我的爷爷！您是中国人民的骄傲！是我们永远的榜样！”

Although some in the audience have enjoyed such a surprise, it has caused quite the trouble for the Tenryou Commission.
Let&#x27;s see who will get the last laugh this time: Arataki Itto with his booming laughter, or the soldiers who are swift at maintaining law and order.

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok &quot;For You Page&quot;! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!

Hi all,
It’s almost the end of year. BetterDev has been 3 years. I never focus on growing it. All I do is just send out newsletter from thing I think will help everyone level up.

                    <span>Hi all,
I recently got myself into the situation where all my local git repos had the wrong remote addresses.  This was caused by a change up on our git account.  
You can see the url that git is currently using by opening the &#x27;config&#x27; file in the .git folder.  You&#x27;ll see it under the &#x27;[remote &quot;origin&quot;]&#x27; section.
Luckily this is pretty trivial to fix.  You can either update the url directly in the config file, or run the following command...
git remote set-url origin new.git.url/xyz</span>

                    <span>Destroyer is a console game I made for my codecademy CSC 101 final project. It is very similar to the game battleship. It uses 2D list to represent the board classes and objects to organize and simplify the code. I know it&#x27;s sloppy, and I&#x27;m sure more experienced devs will look at it like what is this, but it works well and I&#x27;m happy that I made it 😀

                    <span>Let&#x27;s me explain with a simple example:
console.log(&#x27;First log&#x27;);
console.log(&#x27;Second log&#x27;);
console.log(&#x27;Third log&#x27;);

As we can see, every line of code will waits for previous line to complete execution before execute next line. this is called with synchronous.
Here another example:
console.log(&#x27;First log&#x27;);
setTimeout(()&#x3D;&gt;{
    console.log(&#x27;Second log&#x27;);
},2000)
console.log(&#x27;Third log&#x27;)

setTimeout function will wait for milisecond time that set in second argument and executes anonymous function in the first arguments
First log
Third log
undefined
Second log

As we can see, Third log does not wait for Second log to execute, the method of not waiting for the previous code to complete is called asynchronous.
The best way to use asynchronous is when your website working with server to fetching data or getting response, instead of waiting all data from server fully loaded that maybe takes more than one minutes (depend on speed of your internet and server speed to resolve request) you could use asynchronous to make sure that code ahead will execute and javascript will not waiting server response to complete.</span>

&#x27;s great tutorial on how to create a NFT Marketplace on Ethereum with Polygon. So, if you haven&#x27;t started from there, I suggest you do. 
I&#x27;ll be covering how to create a resell item feature to your marketplace, since this was an issue to me and to other developers to whom I have talked to. 
First, in the NFT contract, we&#x27;ll add a function to transfer the token. You may be asking why I don&#x27;t just simply use ERC721&#x27;s tranferFrom function. And the reason is that when I tested my functions, in some situations requests reverted with &quot;transfer caller is not owner nor approved&quot;, even though msg.sender &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ownerOf(tokenId) asserted true. So my solution was to write a custom transfer function. But feel free to share the solution for this stra…</span>

                    <span>Help users with vision disabilities find a search


Usually we know how to place a search for users without vision disabilities. But how should we do that for users with disabilities?
There is a special search role in the WAI-ARIA standard that we should add for the form element. In this case screen readers will start to display search in the &quot;Regions list&quot; mode that is used by users for navigation.
Pay attention, if we don&#x27;t do that search will not be displayed in this mode. So it will hamper users start interaction with search. They will have to find a search using common keys. It&#x27;s much longer than if they use the &quot;Regions list&quot; mode.

Did you think sometimes about how better to move focus when users open elements such as modals or dialogs?

Na Convenia utilizamos o Docker Swarm para gerenciar alguns containers em produção e o Docker Swarm entrega esse tipo de deploy &quot;Zero Down Time&quot; através de uma simples configuração, porém após alguns testes em uma API sob stress constatamos que sempre ocorriam alguns erros no momento do deploy.

                    <span>Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.
A couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. 
The specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh
 posted this:
Dev.to as a headless CMS
Visakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read
#react
        #javascript
        #webdev
        #opensource
      
This was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.
You&#x27;ve probably noticed several deprecations lately. It&#x27;s all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.</span>

                    <span>Hello Friends.
I finally did it. Happened about a month and a half ago. I was ✨ promoted ✨ to a senior level engineering position. Want to know the most frustrating part about it? It didn&#x27;t feel like I deserved it. Yes, imposter syndrome sticks with you.
I started my career as a software engineer five years ago after working a job as a developer at a small startup that just needed hands and thoughts which I kinda see as my boot camp experience.
I started my &quot;engineering&quot; career at a larger, yet still small startup in San Francisco, where I learned a lot, but not enough to become a senior there. I did primarily backend work with a spattering of frontend excursions. I got close to senior at that company. So close that my manager wasn&#x27;t able to pinpoint anything specific to work on.

Forward Proxy
Reverse Proxy
Reverse Proxy Implementation


Step 1: Create origin server
Step 2: Create a reverse proxy server
Step 3: Forward a client request to the origin server (via reverse proxy)
Step 4: Copy origin server response to the client (via reverse proxy)
Common errors
Conclusion



Proxy server is a server that provides a gateway between the client (Alice) and the origin server (Bob). Instead of connecting directly to the origin server (to fulfill a resource request), client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required action a origin server on the client behalf (e.g. get current time).

                    <span>互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。
下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。

一、历史回顾
Web 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。

Web 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。

二、Web3 的特征
Web3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。

我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。
Web 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。
娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。
在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。
三、虚拟世界
所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。
到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。
四、Web3 是分布式的
这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！
这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：
（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；
（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。
五、区块链的作用
如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。
这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。
一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。
另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。
六、数字资产
区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。
如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。

举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。
我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。
我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。
创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说：&quot;Web3 就是所有权&quot;，就是这个意思。

如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。
目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。

                    <span>树莓派是一个小巧的设备，由英国树莓派基金会开发的微型单板，设计的目标是以低价硬件和自由软件促进学校的基本计算机科学教学。麻雀虽小，树莓派本身也是一个五脏俱全的计算机，并且提供通用的 USB 接口、RJ45 网口以及 GPIO 排针接口予以扩展。且由于其较低的售价，受到了各种人群的喜欢。
但是，并不是喜欢树莓派的所有人都有计算机科学的背景，相当大一部分小白都在通过关注极客玩家们的教程，一步一步跟着教程操作来复刻他们做出来的东西。可是，尽管有了教程的帮助，小白在实际操作的过程中也还是会遇到很多失败的情况且不知道如何独立解决。
所以我打算向大家介绍 Balena 这个一站式的解决方案。
Balena： 完整的生态
Balena 是一套完整用于开发、部署、管理 IOT 设备，并提供了云用于连接这些 IOT 设备们的工具和服务。它包括了：

balenaEngine 是一个为嵌入式设备优化的运行引擎，等同于 Docker 的存在，但胜在软件体积更小，需要传输的镜像层更小，内存占用也更少。
balenaOS 是一个极简的 Linux 系统，不同于 Raspberry Pi OS，仅包含了 balenaEngine 以及一些必要的系统组件，使得硬件资源能够被最大化目标软件的使用，但借助 Balena 的其他服务，又可以很轻松的部署我们想要的工具。。
balenaHub 是一个类似 Github 的地方，开发者把软件装载进 balenaOS 中并发布到这里，用户可以从这里免费下载已经打包好的「系统镜像」。
balenaEtcher 是一个开源跨平台的系统镜像烧录工具，有精美易用的 UI 界面，可以把上述系统镜像烧录到 tf 卡中，然后插入树莓派直接开始使用。
balenaFin 一个建立于树莓派计算模块之上的开发板，有更好的存储和电源扩展等。
balenaCloud 就是承载了上述的开发交…</span>

                    <span>前言
随着安全和隐私意识的增强，越来越多的人已经在提供手机号、银行卡号时越发慎重，也知道每一个服务都要尽量使用不同的随机强密码。相比之下，邮箱地址的安全性此前受到的关注并不够充分。其实，邮箱地址也是个人信息的一部分，在交出之前值得多加提防。想象一下，如果能每一次注册都使用不同的随机匿名邮箱，是不是也很酷？
其实，这样的匿名邮箱服务正在变得主流。在 9 月推出的 iOS 15 上，Apple 更新了「iCloud+」功能，其中就包含一项名为「Hide My Email」的匿名邮箱服务；11 月 16 日，Firefox 浏览器也推出了类似的 Firefox Relay 功能。算上之前入局的 Fastmail、DuckDuckGo 等，匿名邮箱的选择前所未有地多。本文中，我们就对这些主流的匿名邮箱服务做一比较，帮助大家选择。
邮箱别名——简易版邮箱匿名方案
在正式对比之前，有必要简单提几句「邮箱别名」（alias）功能。这项功能早在很久之前就被不少邮箱服务所支持，可以看作一种简易版的匿名邮箱方案。具体而言，别名相当于邮箱地址的一个「小号」或「昵称」，发到别名的邮件会和主邮箱共享收件箱。
加号地址
创建别名最简单、通用的方法就是在邮箱地址的域内部分（即俗话说的用户名）后面加上加号（「+」）和任意字符串，常用的 Gmail、Outlook、iCloud 等邮箱服务均支持这个技巧。（加号地址是由 RFC5233 标准定义的，该标准并没有限制用什么符号作为别名的分隔符，但实践中绝大多数邮件服务都采用加号。）
举个例子，你有一个邮箱地址是 sspai@gmail.com，那么发送给 sspai+aaa@gmail.com、sspai+bbb@gmail.com 的邮件都会发送到 sspai@gmail.com 这个地址。
方便是方便，但如果是出于隐私保护而这么做，会有两个问题：

                    <span>事实上，平台的老旧对产品品质的影响还是很重要的，所以我们在买车的时候非常有必要了解对意向车型的生产平台进行了解。
举例，比如一款车换代车型即将上市，旧款（上一代）车型依然在售，如果这时候买了旧款就有些可惜了，相当于是买到了上一代的技术。那如果二手车呢？举个典型例子，都是登记日期在2018-2020年之间的丰田卡罗拉，价格差别不大，车况各有不同。如果你了解12代卡罗拉来自TNGA平台，11代卡罗拉于2019年7月停产，在车况和价格没有太大差别情况下，就一定要选择车身铭牌的出厂日期在2019年7月之后的12代卡罗拉(也可以看后悬架，扭力梁的都是老平台车型)。

为什么？当然是冲着TNGA平台啊，比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构（更准确说法是架构）所产车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。这也就是说来自TNGA架构的第12代卡罗拉，操控性能和驾驶乐趣，包括安全性方面比上一代车型有了显著提高。同样的，这也适用于凯美瑞，只是凯美瑞两代车型之间外观内饰有明显区别，比较不容易混在一块儿（买二手车时）。

尽管平台的最大意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而帮企业节省成本，但从消费者的角度，理论上，新的造车平台比旧（上一代）的更加先进和高级。因此，他也能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。
比如说，大众现在MQB平台的车型，比上一代PQ25/35平台产品在轻量化方面就有了明显提高，用户获得的好处自然是节约了油费。前面也提到了，丰田TNGA架构下的新一代车型，操控方面都比以往有了显著提高，哪怕卡罗拉这样的标准“买菜车”，开起来也不再平庸乏味。
再看现在流行的电动车，以往很多电动车往往是“油改电”的过渡性产品，会在电机、电池摆布、车内空间、行驶及安全品质等方面出现很多不够完善的地方，而来自全新的纯电车造车平台的电动车就很好地解决了这一问题。

总的来说，新旧平台的产品尽量选新的，但凡事没绝对，某些新平台车型的某些细节甚至还不如旧平台车型，比如PQ46的斯柯达昊锐，反而比MQB平台的速派，在底盘厚重感、转向手感方面主观感受更好。此外，老款车型在产品生涯末期往往有较大优惠，如果一些产品点上的差异消费者本身也不是很敏感，那倒也没有什么。  

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。
目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

路上偶然遇见的河




这一次，我们两家、六人、一辆房车，从丽江出发到拉萨，然后原路返回。美景的图片集锦已经发过了，今天就发一发这一路记录的日记吧。。。
28日 第一天 大理到丽江到香格里拉
早上7点半，我们迎着大理的朝霞出发了，第一站就是去丽江的房车生活家提车点取房车。
在沟通了解房车事项近五个小时之后，我们终于出发了，奔向我们的目的地，西藏。这对于我们，对于四岁的孩子们来说，将是一个未知又充满惊喜的挑战！
特意从丽江玉龙雪山脚下转了一圈后，晚上我们到达香格里拉古城附近的广场。逛了夜晚的独克宗古城，给开了一天车的爸爸们补充能量，吃了一顿牦牛肉大餐。
夜晚的香格里拉真冷啊，让我们几个大人有了一种回到大学宿舍的感觉，水是刺骨的，但想象着我们领略着世界第三极绝美的风光，心中就充满了期待。







29日 香格里拉到梅里雪山
前一晚的房车睡眠着实让人为接下来越来越冷的行程捏一把汗，一边担心孩子们受冻着凉，一边又不甘心就这样放弃掉。好在云南冬日的阳光总是让人感觉到温暖，上午推开房车门的阳光消除了所有的担心，我们决定带着孩子坚持走下去。
洗漱完毕就踏上了最爱的菜市场环节，香格里拉的菜市场，有堆成尖的奶酪，有黄色的白色的，我们在好奇心驱使下买了一块“甜的奶酪”，结果让人难以入口，像吃坏掉的奶渣一样，可能这种美食我们的嘴是无福消受了。但是买到的牦牛肉、藏香猪和苹果让我们重拾信心，出发前我们就定好了要买这边的肉做烤肉，买到了就刻不容缓，直奔野营地——浓雾顶。那是在图片上才能看到平视梅里雪山的地方，运气好就能看到日出金山和梅里雪山的顶峰。带着几分祈祷，我们又踏上了路途。
晚上周转了很久才在寻问下找到了露营地，可惜太晚了天已经黑了，我们围坐在篝火旁，吃起了新鲜的牦牛肉，孩子们在旁边刨坑挖土，做着扮演…</span>

Stepping into a DMV when you&#x27;re about to take your first driver&#x27;s test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral &quot;drivers license&quot; (hence the DMV locale and its &quot;interesting vibes.&quot;) Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and so…</span>

Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one. Because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy ten minute videos and unfortunately, reality is, well, complicated. The question of how we deal with that, is central to what we do on this channel and something we think about a lot.

                    <span>casey neistat film school enrollment at https://monthly.com/casey

my 30-day online filmmaking &amp; storytelling class just launched! Enrollment is open now until December 27.  the class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience, designed to teach you everything I know about filmmaking and storytelling, i&#x27;m going to share with you my entire creative process from start to finish. You&#x27;re going to follow along with me as I create 2 brand new movies from scratch... from how I come up the ideas, all the way through exporting the final videos.

over the month, you&#x27;ll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 2 original, shareable films of your own.  its is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. I spent the past year working on it, and I&#x27;m extremely proud of the result. It&#x27;s designed to level you up whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a more experienced filmmaker.

The class officially starts on January 10, 2022, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you&#x27;re interested

(also In the video, I say it&#x27;s $300, but it&#x27;s actually $249)

                    <span>Background


I just finished creating a few small lambda functions using Python.
My project needed the following libraries:
requests for making HTTP requests.
pysftp for creating SSH connections to different servers. 
If you need a different library, the approach should be the same, assuming it&#x27;s installable using pip or pip3. 
Unfortunately we didn’t have access to Container Registry (ECR) so we couldn&#x27;t create a docker container, which would have allowed us to install the dependencies as part of the docker container creation.
We instead had to create &amp; upload a zip file containing our application code and dependencies.
While we could include the application dependencies in the zip we upload, this has a few disadvantages:
It slows down each upload, which is not ideal as you might end up u…</span>

In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll build a dashboard on top of postgresSQL database. This is a simple dashboard showing a view of projects and users stored in the database. We&#x27;ll use React for frontend, semantic-ui for UI library, Canonic for creating APIs, and to add some graphics we&#x27;ll use recharts library.
We&#x27;re looking to create something like this:

It was a regular screening interview with someone from another part of the world sitting in the same-furniture office.
Rainy weather in winter does not help to focus at all, and I go to get some coffee. Being sleepy is something I want to avoid at all costs. Pouring over Columbian coffee gives a brain energy spike. It is important to have fifteen minutes before the interview starts. You need to switch focus away from the routine. 
A notebook with a pen are prepared to record the candidate&#x27;s answers, emotions, body language, and my quick feedback.

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Dec. 2nd we had our second Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 2. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.
Did any of the types listed surprise you?
What great examples have you seen of a particular content type? What stands out about it?
Sarah Rainsberger mentioned she found the distinction between a “Tutorial” and a “How to Guide” interesting. She liked that the book made these two content types distinct.

                    <span>Probably, you have used the speedtest website before, but did you know that speedtest has a python library.
In this tutorial, We will learn to use the speedtest library to test your internet Speed. We&#x27;ll also learn how to use speedtest command lines.
Let&#x27;s get started. 
To install speedtest via pip, follow this command:
pip install speedtest-cli

After installing the speedtest package. Now, let&#x27;s see how to use it with the code.
In the following code, I&#x27;ll test my internet download speed.
import speedtest

# Speed test
st &#x3D; speedtest.Speedtest()

# Download Speed
ds &#x3D; st.download()

print(ds)

let me explain.
First, we import the speedtest package. Then, called Speedtest() class. Next, test my download speed using the download() method. Finally, print the result.

I bet you got that. #Smartdev
What is version control?
What is git?
How does git work?
What is GitHub?
What is the difference between git and GitHub?
It is a way to document the code you use for analysis. 
Git is a distributed Version Control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux Kernel, that makes tracking code over time easy and effortless.
Git:
Tracks iterative change that&#x27;s made to the code one tells it to manage. Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.


It facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. 


Easily switches between Versions of your code.


Easily undo changes.




  
  
  What is GitHub?🤔


First, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
Git is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.
Git is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.
Can&#x27;t be any simpler than that!!

                    <span>I was working around a few days back, managing the release of the project with versioning and proper tags associated with it which results in writing the python code.
I have written a simple python function that will call the API of GitHub and will Create/Fetch /Delete the release on GitHub.
Note** You can manage the same with CURL command too but I was facing some authentication issue, so haven’t done, I haven’t tried with explicitly passing the auth token in header by -H tag, you can give a try.
Have a look at the below snippet of code which can be easily integrated with Jenkins pipeline
&#x60;# Begin
user &#x3D; &quot;&quot;             #username of github account
https://api.github.com&quot;
Here, tag_name and releaseId variables are only required if you want to delete a particular release, which you will rarely come across.
# Fetch latest release from github


The above code will be used to fetch the latest release present on GitHub.
# Create latest release on github


This snippet of code is used to create the release on GitHub, which contains payload in JSON format.
release.json will look something like below,
{


Even with this payload, you can easily create prerelease of the master branch, which can be tested in the Staging environment.
# Delete release from github by passing tag_name &amp; releaseId


The above deletion method is not often required.
The full script is available in the below repository.
Github Link: https://github.com/nik0811/github-release-api.git
Feel free to comment below, if you will found any mistakes or required any type of modifications/enhancement. The code is fully tested so hopefully, you will not find any issues.</span>

                    <span>What is Samba ?


We know that when you think of samba, you immediately think of happy Brazilians dancing.

But.. We are so sorry because situation here is not quite what you think. (We know that you are trying to hide your bewilderment because we experienced the same at the beginning.)
So it always happens like this...

Now let&#x27;s come to our main topic, what is the real samba we are talking about?
SAMBA is a project developed in 1991 by re-adapting the SMB network protocol as free software with reverse engineering methods.
However, it is also worth mentioning that the difference from the default SMB protocol to which it is implemented progresses in a path and version map.
For example, SAMBA 3 released in 2003, enabled the integration of file and printer services between GNU/Linux systems …</span>

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m glad the comment happened when it did. It is better than never getting it, but think about the time that was just lost. 😱
As the reviewer, I treat this as a smell. What can we do better to make this reusable code more obvious? 
Better documentation? 
As the author, I feel lazy. How did I miss that we already do this? 
I am new to my current codebase, and I have had this happen a few times already. I knew the codebase at my previous company like the back of my hand.

                    <span>继 Beats Studio Buds 在 7 月推出之后，没想到还没半年时间，Beats 今年还有新品发布。与前者一样，Beats 最新推出的 Beats Fit Pro 是一款真无线蓝牙降噪耳机，不同的是，这款耳机搭载了 Apple H1 芯片，除了主动降噪和通透模式，它还支持空间音频、iCloud 同步、自动切换等新功能，售价 1,599 元。

外观设计
Beats Fit Pro 的充电盒与 2019 年推出的 Powerbeats Pro 类似，方形圆润的设计，尺寸比后者稍小、比 AirPods Pro 的充电盒更大一些。类肤质材质的运用也是现在 Beats 产品的「标配」。类肤质材质表面的缺点也很明显，容易沾染指纹、油污，需要经常清洁；当然，好处是不容易产生划痕等不可修复的损伤。

虽然充电盒尺寸接近 Powerbeats Pro，Beats Fit Pro 的耳机大小可是实实在在地小了不少，尺寸与 AirPods Pro 和 AirPods 可以说是差不多一致。同样作为入耳式耳机，由于没有「侵入感」明显的耳挂式设计，Beats Fit Pro 的佩戴体验自然比 Powerbeats Pro 要好上不少，个人认为与 AirPods Pro 的入耳感受接近。不同的是，Beats Fit Pro 用上了一个全新的耳翼式设计。

此前市面上采用耳翼式设计的耳机，多是提供了多个尺寸的可更换耳翼选择，以让用户实现稳定舒适的佩戴体验。Beats Fit Pro 则直接通过柔韧性更好的软性硅胶材料打造通用型耳翼，让耳翼能够根据不同耳形大小达到灵活弯折的效果，让不同用户都能轻松佩戴。
据 Beats 介绍，Beats Fit Pro 的耳翼基于人体工学设计，外形和选材经过大量用户的运动数据测试和验证，不仅耐用、稳定，还优化了耳机的佩戴贴合度和⻓时间佩戴的舒适度，确保声学性能不…</span>

在我卖掉 iPad Air 3 而买了 iPad mini 6 之后，就一直在为其物色一款合适的键盘。
之前 Air 3 一直使用的都是官方 Smart Keyboard：价格奇贵、手感奇差、还不能保护背面。但无需充电、吸上即用，拥有任何其他键盘都无法相比的一体性。
可惜的是，Apple 并未给 iPad mini 提供官方的键盘解决方案，而是仅注明了其支持「蓝牙键盘」。
iPad mini 仅支持蓝牙键盘
这并不奇怪，毕竟 iPad mini 的尺寸决定了它更偏向于一款内容消费设备，而非生产设备。不过这也不妨碍我为 mini 选配一款便携式的蓝牙键盘，以随时随地完成轻量的文字处理任务。
那些被我淘汰的备选项
我最先看中的是 Logitech 的 Keys-To-Go 键盘。作为上架 Apple Store 的产品，这款键盘有着简洁漂亮的外观和专为 iOS 设备优化的快捷键。同时，作为非折叠式的传统键盘，Keys-To-Go 的尺寸也只有 24.2*13.7 cm，仅仅比 iPad mini 6 (19.5*13.5 cm) 大上一点。抛开略显昂贵的售价 (¥480) 不谈，它的确是 iPad mini 的理想搭档。

不过，经过一番搜索，我也成功被 Keys-To-Go 的问题劝退了。首先是耐用性。有不少网友（1, 2, 3, 见评论区）都表示 Keys-To-Go 在使用一两年之后，可能会出现按键鼓包等现象，这样的耐用性让我很难把它当作「传家宝」。
有关按键鼓包的评论不少

                    <span>作为一个主打内容创作的社区，少数派中大家讨论最多的可能就是写作工具了，而其中以语法简单，专注于内容创作著称的 Markdown 编辑器则是其中的焦点，从以优雅的设计和易用性著称的 Ulysses 和 MWeb，再到主打同步的 Bear 等一系列写作工具，其实都向我们展示了 Markdown 这样一款语法简单的语言是如何真正的提高文字创作者效率的。而作为一位「老少数派」，我则从 2015年开始全面转向 Markdown 写作，只不过一开始我就在使用本文的主角—— Typora，一开始选择其实最看重的跨平台特性：在 Windows 平台上很难再找到一款颜值上线的 Markdown 编辑器了。

在发布首个测试版的之后的第六年，这款「纯粹」的 Markdown 编辑器也正式发布了首个 1.0 正式版。同时上线的还有其收费计划——买断式付费，可激活三台设备，如果大版本更新可能还要另外收费，费用为 89 元人民币。在习惯性「白嫖」六年后，正式宣布收费也引起了不小的争议，那么这样一款纯粹的 Markdown 编辑器是否真的值得付费？或许看完本篇全方面的测评，你会在心中留下你自己的答案。
真正意义上的全桌面平台支持
相比某些只是支持单一平台的 Markdown 编辑器，Typora 在最早期就开始对多个平台的支持，除了最为常见的 macOS 以及 Windows 之外，还支持 Linux 桌面环境，并且所有的平台的外观以及功能都保持了高度的一致。

而在本次 1.0 正式版中，Typora 进一步提供了几乎全桌面平台的支持，这里不仅仅是系统层面的，还包括系统架构。除了包含了在此前测试版中我们就已经熟知的 x86 /x86-64，还加入了对 ARM64 版 Windows 以及 Linux 的支持，尤其是在类似树莓派这样的单板电脑中，也有了设计美观的 Markdown 可用。

                    <span>我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。
我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。
为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。
翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：
随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug
还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：
可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动
这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。
展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：
这个项目放弃前的一段录屏
我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。
所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！

                    <span>游戏音频，即是存在于游戏世界里的一切声音，然而大家是否能够想象，在如今的一款开放大世界游戏中，存在的声音文件数量也许不是以千计，也不是以万计，而是以十万计。
在越来越庞大且复杂的游戏面前，游戏音频早已不是什么隐于背景中的音乐，仅由几位神秘的音乐艺术家就能闭门完成。在才华与灵感之外，AI 算法、机器学习、Object-Based Audio 技术、跨国合研等先进技术与模式，也已悄然融入游戏音频这块依旧让人略感陌生的领域。

游戏音频到底是什么？正在经历哪些新趋势？未来将如何发展？我们邀请到了来自天美音频中心的六位音频专家，其中有一直与天美共同成长的中国设计师，也有来自海外 3A 游戏厂商的外籍专家。他们将与我们分享对游戏音频的热爱，以及对其未来发展的展望。


—— 我认为非线性声音设计是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
大家好！我是 Beej Paz，我已经在游戏行业摸爬滚打了 13 年，加入天美之前，我在育碧担任音频总监。
游戏音频是我毕生热爱的事业，我认为非线性声音设计，是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
当玩家在游戏中的决策/行动有了意义时，我们就能以此为切入点，让音频发挥作用。如果声音设计能够更贴近玩家、更具有意义，那么我们也能顺利建立起与玩家之间连接的纽带和信任。
音频带来的愉悦和沉浸感可以让玩家得到情感上的满足，塑造一个又一个的“感觉棒极了”的时刻。我们为玩家打造出的这些“魔力”时刻，不仅能够启发灵感，还将影响下一代从业者对未来游戏音频的观念。
我们总是从过去和现在的那些伟大前辈们身上得到启发，收获灵感。这是一种传承，我们这代游戏音频人就是这么过来的。

                    <span>写在前面：感谢天美同事帮我把想法翻译成了中文跟大家交流。以下所有配图都是公开图片，仅供专业探讨，所以请不要指望这里可以看到拳头或者育碧的机密信息；）
大家好，我是 Francois Dallaire，坐标新加坡，目前是天美 F1 工作室的技术美术专家（Principal Tehnical Artist），已有过十多年的技术美术从业经验。
多年来，中国手游在海外的成绩一直很亮眼，但直到近一两年，我们才逐渐看到中国游戏公司在 AAA 游戏研发上与日俱增的兴趣。
在此之前，很多 AAA 大作都有中国开发者参与，但大多是负责部分模块或者作为外包团队，很少能主导完整的项目。现在中国工作室开发自己的 AAA 项目，招揽和借助全球 AAA 人才的经验来起步也是很正常的事情。在西方，这种 AAA 公司间的人才流动早已成为常态。
与此同时，中国游戏公司在研发技术上的进步也很引人注目。比如 2018 年在游戏开发者大会（GDC）上亮相的虚拟人 Siren，展现了中国游戏公司对于次世代研发技术的探索，吸引了许多像我一样的全球游戏研发从业者的注意。我相信中国游戏开发者已经做好准备，迎接新的挑战。

随着中国游戏公司加入 AAA 游戏的全球化研发潮流，这成为了一个双向选择的过程。游戏公司在寻找特定领域的资深人才，而人才也在寻找有潜力的项目。
就我所知，技术相关的岗位往往最先受到关注，比如技术美术、技术动画等。经过种种考虑，我选择加入了有 13 年自研积累的天美，相信这里的项目会为我带来更广阔的职业前景。
全球化研发潮流下的技术美术
放在 15 年前，游戏行业还不存在技术美术（Technical artists，以下简称 TA）岗位，但随着行业的发展，TA 已越来越受重视，并成为当前中国游戏行业最紧缺的岗位之一。
我从事 TA 已有十余年的时间，入行之初也经历过一些变化。最初，我在动视做游戏测试（te…</span>

                    <span>Boxing superstar and five-time world champion Gervonta “Tank” Davis put his boxing skills on display, winning a rousing 12-round round unanimous decision over the relentless Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz to retain his WBA Lightweight World Title in front of a star-studded, sellout crowd of 15,850 at STAPLES Center live on SHOWTIME Pay-Per-View. 
 
There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
“That’s my style. ‘Pitbull’ is always going to be on the attack,” said Cruz. “I think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.”
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis’ ribs.

This is part 2 of my Halo Infinite Multiplayer review! Where I mostly talk about the positives and great innovations that 343i have made. Despite the lackluster content, Infinite is an exceptional Halo title. The foundation is laid and I can&#x27;t wait to see what is built on top of it.

                    <span>A few days ago, my friend made me a scavenger hunt on the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players&#x27; hearts... Will I be Solving my Friend&#x27;s Impossible Minecraft Puzzle...

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. 

Thanks to @Vort3xDragon for making the scavenger hunt, this was epic!

                    <span>what&#x27;s up typescript enthusiasts 👋
as seen in this tutorial?
1- Install @types/node in your project
$ yarn add @types/node -D

// or using npm

$ npm i @types/node -D

2- First of all, download the VSC extension TS Env Typings
3- Specify env-typings.json file in the root of your project.

4- Add path field to your development .env file

That&#x27;s it, Enjoy!
1- Specify path for the generated output using output field in the JSON config.

2- Auto detect env variable type so that It can give you a nice example in the intellisense on how to use and parse it.
so as an example if you&#x27;ve a number env variable It&#x27;ll tell you to use parseInt to parse it before using it cause env variables are always read as strings.

3- Variants for an env variable, so you tell the extension what are the possible values for an env variable so It can generate better types for it and recommend you a nicer example to use

add a comment at the end of the env line that includes &quot;# variants:&quot;


specify the different variants for your variable seperated by a &quot;|&quot; like you would in typscript


quotes are optional around the variants values




That&#x27;s it.
Hope you&#x27;ve a great day, curios to see your feedback 🤗</span>

                    <span>A while back, someone asked me in an interview to print &quot;Hello World&quot; in the console 50 times without using a loop.
Afterward, I start pondering... let&#x27;s find out?
If you want to check it out: https://github.com/Noriller/js-console.log
I&#x27;ve made a repository and used jest to test if everything was working, I&#x27;ve also used this auxiliary function:
function Log() {
  console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}

Most were just variations of the same thing... but I did manage to make it work in some unexpected ways.
Because... why not?
Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log…</span>

                    <span>Things rarely go as planned, especially in the world of programming. Errors are unavoidable when writing code, which can be frustrating at times. 
via GIPHY
In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to handle exceptions in Python.
An exception is an error that occurs while the program is running. In some cases, an exception may cause the program to stop or produce unexpected results. For example, taking a look at Fig 1.0. This program gets two numbers from the user and divides the first number by the second number, and displays the result. However, when the program is run, an exception occurs as shown in Fig 1.1.

Fig 1.0



Fig 1.1


The error message displayed in Fig 1.1 is called a traceback. A traceback provides information about the line number(s) that resulted in the exception. In Fig. 1.1,…</span>

                    <span>Episode 11: Use the Filesystem Class to Read a Directory



In this episode, we create a Post model class and move the post finding code from the route definition to the Mode class method find(). We add another method all() to this class where we fetch all posts from the resource/posts directory. We use the Laravel File Facades Illuminate\Support\Facades\File fetch all the files from a directory into an array. 
Contributed to the Blog project:
Move post finding logic from route def to a Model class
Make the posts index page dynamic by getting file contents using the Laravel File Facades
Before:
Route::get(&#x27;/posts/{post}&#x27;, function ($slug) {
    $path &#x3D; __DIR__.&quot;/../resources/posts/{$slug}.html&quot;;

No fear, this is not a tutorial. This is more of a strategic guide. Decision makers will continue reading. Apply these concepts to your project.
Opinion. After deploying countless websites, you will see the narrow difference between tech stacks. Python, PHP, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, and others all write HTTP responses. This uniformity means developers can pass all HTTP handling through a standardized web server interface like Apache/NGINX.
 
Web servers are a MUST and highly optimized for driving web traffic. Apache/NGINX fulfill common needs such as simultaneous requests, encryption, and &quot;path rewriting&quot; (sales). Businesses that do not use quintessential web servers are doomed to face early scaling issues.

Read more about Conductor here: https://github.com/Netflix/conductor
Visit our codebase and give us a star, it helps! :)
Conductor can orchestrate HTTP services out of the box without implementing any code.  We will use that to create and run our first workflow.
To follow the steps in this article we will need to have Conductor running on your local. We can do that by following the steps here
This is a sample workflow that we can leverage for our test.

                    <span>The terminal can be an intimidating place for anyone, like me, who has spent most of their life living in a ✨Graphical User Interface✨ paradise. 
In the GUI, it seems like nothing can really go that wrong. However, on the command line, it feels like a single cat-on-keyboard moment can bring everything crashing down. 🐱🔥
It is my belief that the terminal itself is not what frightens us, but the unfamiliarity of it all. Once you build up your confidence, the terminal can, and will, be your new best friend. 👯 I promise!
The first time I entered the terminal, I had no idea where I was. You don&#x27;t believe me? Look at the first 15 commands I ever ran: 
 Unfortunately, hello and where am i, yielded no results. You know what did? Making a ton of mistakes, which I like to call, &quot;practice.&quot; (I real…</span>

                    <span>At Arbington.com we use Stripe.com to handle all of our payments. 
It&#x27;s secure, fast, and honestly it&#x27;s a developers dream.
For this, you should be familiar with Ajax/Fetch requests and being able to work with an API. We use Python on the backend, so we use Stripes&#x27;s Python API. 
We will show some demo code, but you&#x27;ll need to fill in the blanks. 
First, you&#x27;ll need a Stripe.com account. It&#x27;s free to setup, and they give you two sets of API keys:
A test pair of public and private keys 
A live pair of public and private keys 
The test keys will make payments to your test account, and toggling between testing data and real payment data is as easy as clicking a toggle button in their dashboard. 
Two things to note about Stripe:

                    <span>In honour of Hannukah this year, I undertook to write 8 web components tips, one for each night of the festival. Tonight is the 8th and final night of the festival. The mystics said that this night combines and contains aspects of each of the seven previous nights, so I&#x27;d like to share a compilation of those tips with the dev community.
Wishing you and yours a fully Lit Hannukah!
Did you know you can add reactive controllers to an element via a class or field decorator? You don&#x27;t even need to assign it to an instance property!

  return function(klass) {

                    <span>The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays. Array is a special type of object that is mutable and it is used to store multiple values.
In this article, we will implement our own array methods from scratch. These implementations don&#x27;t intend to replace the existing methods but to provide a better understanding of how these methods work and their uses.



Methods

                    <span>近期，Mental Canvas 这款特殊的 iPad 绘画 App 凭借其独特的画作展示效果闯入了公众视野。

简单来说，这是一款拥有「3D 画布」的草图绘画工具，你可以将图层分别放置于立体空间中的不同位置，最后得以通过运动的「摄像机」来展示整个画作。

Mental Canvas 目前提供的功能数量不算多，本文将逐一详细介绍，作为简单的使用教程提供给各位参考。  
界面排布
Mental Canvas 除了画布界面外没有设置其他界面，在打开 App 时会立刻创建一个新项目。操作界面中的按钮排布和交互设计的逻辑与大多同类产品存在较大出入，说实话这让我在刚上手时有一点懵。
界面中设有「顶部工具栏」、左侧的「画布及图层列表」、底部的用于定位摄像机的「时间轴」，共三个板块。顶部工具栏从左至右可以分为「操作区」「绘制区」「定位区」和「模式切换开关」四个区域。（当然，这些都是我自拟的名字。）

绘制区
在顶部工具栏中的绘制区可以点选使用「画笔工具」「橡皮擦工具」「油漆桶工具」来进行作画。选中画笔工具后再次点击该按钮可以展开画笔设置界面，提供了更改画笔类型和调节画笔粗细的选项。

这三个按钮右侧有「调色盘」按钮，展开后可以进行取色或自定义颜色。

选取调整界面
位于绘制区最左侧的是「选取调整」按钮，选中后会在顶部工具栏置换为一系列新按钮，实质上是进入了选取调整界面。顶部工具栏左侧的区域为「选取区」，右侧为「调整区」。

选取区
选取区的按钮用于选取图层内的部分内容以便调整，其中提供了「按笔画选取」和「套索选取」两种选取方式，分别可以选择画面中一部分笔画或选择圈选的部分区域作为选区。其余的按钮分别为「向选区添加」「从选区减去」「取消选取」「反选」。
调整区
调整区包含几种对选区的调整操作，从左至右分别是用于修改选区部分颜色的「重上色」、清除选区内容的「删除」、启用后会使后几个调整改为对…</span>

2021 年 11 月 12 日，宫崎英高又一次「跌入」神坛。这次倒也没别的，只是万代南梦宫于 2019 年 E3 游戏展上亮相的新作《艾尔登法环》终于开始了发售前的首次封闭网络测试。虽然仍在监修的游戏内容在封测中的表现依然需要打磨，但其优秀的总体质量和极高的媒体热度已然将玩家们对游戏跳票的不满冲刷殆尽，万代南梦宫甚至宣布该作的首发预期销量高达 400 万份，综合宫崎英高作品一贯的强口碑和高销量，这个数字似乎还显得保守了那么一点。
如今作为世界知名游戏发行商的万代南梦宫同时也是任天堂的最强游戏代工厂，其下属的工作室有半数以上为任天堂开发游戏。仅在 NS 平台，除去万代南梦宫自家发售的各类粉丝向冷饭之外，《马力欧赛车 8》这样的第一方大作有半数以上的内容由万代南梦宫参与制作，而《任天堂全明星大乱斗：特别版》这样的爆款游戏则是全盘交给万代南梦宫承包。众所周知，万代南梦宫在玩家群体中一直被归类为「任黑」，但这两家公司在游戏开发事务上的密切关系却形成了一种奇怪的 CP 感，不禁让人直呼「磕到了」。
相比起万代的小红标，这个 Logo 在游戏行业中更加为人熟知。
万代南梦宫由成立于 1950 年的万代和 1955 年的南梦宫合并而成，这两家公司是日本游戏产业的两大支柱，虽然侧重的领域有所不同，但它们都有过一个共同的合作伙伴和竞争对手：任天堂。与 1988 年就使用「替身攻击」欧拉任天堂的南梦宫不同，万代从一开始并没有那么勇。 FC 时代，作为任天堂授权厂商之一的万代自然也不满于任天堂不近人情的审查机制，与任天堂发生了一点小摩擦，不过二者之间…</span>

For the first time in the cinematic history of Spider-Man, our friendly neighborhood hero&#x27;s identity is revealed, bringing his Super Hero responsibilities into conflict with his normal life and putting those he cares about most at risk. When he enlists Doctor Strange’s help to restore his secret, the spell tears a hole in their world, releasing the most powerful villains who’ve ever fought a Spider-Man in any universe. Now, Peter will have to overcome his greatest challenge yet, which will not only forever alter his own future but the future of the Multiverse.

                    <span>This is the story and theory of the origin story of the Minecraft Villager. Who is he? And what is his secrets? That&#x27;s what we uncover in this Minecraft Video. This theory / lore was wild! Minecraft&#x27;s most evil villager used to be just another innocent humble villager. He and his followers would eventually become the illagers.

                    <span>So, C++ extends C, and as that being the case, the implementation of varargs persisted (and hasn&#x27;t changed, since it could break already existing code).
In C, you could do #include , which included some functions for navigating the arguments.
.h files are deprecated (in C++).
So I&#x27;m wondering, what&#x27;s the effective way of using varargs in C++?</span>

                    <span>In this post I&#x27;ll demonstrate a way to understand, analyse and reduce the time complexity on algorithms, specially on nested loops.
The examples will use Ruby but it can be translated to any programming language.
Working throughout a variety of projects, it&#x27;s not rare to stumble on pieces of code like the following, a &quot;nested loop&quot;, which is a loop under another loop:
for group in groups
  for user in users
    # do something with the group and user
  end
end

Analysing the above code, and assuming we have 100 groups and 100 users:
for each group (100 times) we iterate over all users (100 times), which leads 100 * 100 &#x3D; 10000 iterations
each iteration has a cost to the CPU, so the more iterations we do, the more our algorithm will perform worse
if the lists grow over time, we can face seri…</span>

                    <span>The third minor version of Agrippa, the React component CLI, is finally out!
Since v1.2.0 came out, Agrippa has seen tremendous growth - counting the difference in stars on the GitHub repo, for example, we&#x27;ve grown by 120% (154 stars) over the course of just over 40 days! 
This is a good opportunity to say that I&#x27;m truly grateful for everyone who have tried Agrippa out and joined the community; I&#x27;m delighted to see Agrippa growing and being used, and I&#x27;m super excited for it to grow and improve further in the future.
So, thanks everyone!
Get started here.
As for the new version, this one was in the works for longer than the previous two; integration tests, in particular, were a challenge to implement.

As a developer, integrating APIs into your project is imperative. I recently integrated PayPal&#x27;s payment gateway on a side project and plan on sharing how to do it.
PayPal is well known for online payments. Its credibility and developer experience have convinced many users to use it. 
client-side. And the second one is server-side integration.
If I talk about the reading resources:
A developer won&#x27;t need anything further than visiting this page. I really don&#x27;t think you need anything else. Documentation
Reasons to consider this resource-
The workflow is very well explained.
The code sample is available
Steps to test out provided.
Talking about the video resources:





This is a pretty short and concise video. 
It is from the official channel of Paypal.
This video very well explains the concept of different ways to integrate on any website.
Covers all the cases and is easy to follow up.
There is one more resource, that developers can follow up. I am not promoting their channel in any manner but I liked their flow and ease to follow.
Paypal Official Source
I will not be getting into the benefits of applying on Client or Backend. That is up to the developer&#x27;s choice of preference. If I had to recommend one, then I would have to say an easy way to implement would b the first one.
Getting on to the resource, this video takes care of most of the integration:




API integration I would say. I used this node module paypal-checkout
Installing it was very easy.
The npm page was
also very helpful and informative.
This resource has Video tutorials.
Demo app space and much more cool stuff.
This was all enough for integration I think. Moving ahead, I will be sharing my reviews of my experience. Learning was also easy as I expected, the official support and documentation were very helpful. But the

                    <span>CircleCI is not the most popular CI/CD platform for open source contributors today, but it is widely used by many big sharks in the industry. So we have to keep in mind how to accurately configure it. 
CircleCI offers several execution environments. Those bold nerds from San Francisco call them executors. An executor defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job. Set up your jobs to run in the docker, machine, macos or windows executor and specify an image with the tools and packages you need.

Also, CircleCI provide using so-called orbs with its platform. Orbs are open-source, shareable packages of parametrizable reusable configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. You may involve orbs to reduce configuration complexity and help you integrate …</span>

I either end up over or under evaluating myself. This is due to who I think I am maybe completely different how other people actually perceive me to be.
I used a few different ways to identify my strengths and weaknesses. This consisted of:
Asking my peers and those around me: this helped me create a less self-serving bias list. I avoided asking people that I wasn’t too close with as they would give me vague and ‘nicer’ strengths and weaknesses. 
Taking an MBTI test: this helped me understand my personality better and how this can be reflected in my strengths and weaknesses

                    <span>When I started my first developer role about a year ago, I was both excited and worried. Excited to code on the job, and worried that they&#x27;d fire me when they found out that I didn&#x27;t actually know how to code. 
I had just written my first lines of JavaScript a couple months ago, and the knowledge gaps I had seemed infinite. It felt strange to call myself an Engineer when others who started with me clearly knew so much more than me. 
At first, I attributed these self-doubts and feelings of insecurity to my career change. After all, people&#x27;s professions often form an important part of their identity, and mine had just changed completely. But over time, I realised that a lot of people around me felt the same, regardless of their background.

                    <span>写了两篇关于消费的文章，这次回归产品经理主业，聊聊个人管理。
做好个人管理和做好产品经理这两件事在我看来是相辅相成的。首先，我们身边的大部分人都是毕业就开始打工（甚至还没毕业已经在打工了），大部分的时间都花在了工作上，一方面是为了生存，通过劳动我们会获得报酬，另一方面也可以说是实现自我价值或者其他你觉得重要的点。总之我们的生活方式以及整个人都在不知不觉间被工作塑造了。
以我自己为例，产品经理这个岗位的其中一项职能是项目管理，虽然有的公司会细分出「项目经理」岗，但大部分中小型公司的产品都在兼任或曾经兼任过项目经理。所以在产品经理工作中，我逐渐养成了项目管理的思维模式：使项目能够在有限资源限定条件下，实现或超过设定的需求和期望的过程，而个人管理是我们每个人最独一无二的项目。

百度百科：在个人管理中，个体既是管理者，也是被管理者。

背景
一开始我的个人管理诉求源于我对现实生活的不满，毕业后我留在家乡工作，住在家里。因为无法随时所欲地生活，就十分想拥有自己的住所，然后我制定了一个 3 年买房计划。可当时的我不知道个人管理怎么做，更没有认清现实，只是内心有一个很想实现的目标，其他全凭感觉，每天的日子还是过得浑浑噩噩，不仅没有缩短跟目标之间的距离，还在走弯路。
工作中的管理实践
所幸我的工作是自己喜欢的，因为能接触到更多的信息，并不断学习新东西。我需要每天在工作前明确当前是项目的什么阶段，写下今天要完成什么任务，要跟谁沟通以及得到怎样的结果，然后在每天结束工作后记录当天任务的完成情况并复盘：是否存在风险？该如何安排明天的工作？——当然你也可以把这些简称为「日报」。除此以外，我还要去了解行业发展趋势和热点，国内外优秀互联网公司最近又推出了什么新 App、新功能等等，就需要有工具去整理并归纳这些资料以及尽量高效。
通过工作，我首先接触并掌握的个人管理内容是信息管理也可称为知识管理。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。
中山纪念堂
「城市漫步」（citywalk）通常会有一个领队带十多个人在城市中走一段固定路线，以此观察和了解城市的历史、建筑和文化景观，这种旅行方式在日本和欧洲国家比较流行。但国内目前只有上海有比较多团队组织城市漫步活动，但其实中国还有很多城市同样特别适合漫步，比如中山。
中山城区保留了许多老街老巷，历史丰富的老式民居藏匿于其中，路边是为行人遮阴的高高的行道树，城市中还有平靓正的美食，这些让中山成为一座十分适合行走的城市。而也我因为在中山生活而爱上了城市漫步，在中山生活的四年多时间里也走过许多的大大小小的街巷，喜欢上用行走的方式了解一座城市，去旅行的时候总是先往老城区的巷子里钻。于是我编辑了这篇文章来分享了自己在中山漫步经验，希望为大家认识城市提供一种新的视角。
俯瞰中山
一、以历史文化景观为中心的城市漫步
中国东南沿海地区的许多建筑都受民国时期南洋华侨带来的建筑风潮的影响，比如下面要提到的碉楼和骑楼，以及随处可见的各式民居。这些建筑在吸收外来建筑审美的同时又结合了当地传统的文化，并在建造中因地制宜的产生了多种多样的形态，每栋建筑都有自己独特的个性，成为中山街头独特的风景，而这些都是只有通过城市漫步的方式才能体验到。

民居
漫步路线：仁厚里、永安里、龙母庙街、拱辰路、水关街、下河泊、弓箭巷、华贵坊、从善坊
由于核心城区没有受到很大程度的开发，中山保留了大片的老住宅区，这些住宅区的交通网络交错纵横四通八达，许多历史悠久、形态各异的民居就扎根在这些街巷深处。中山现存的老民居不…</span>

                    <span>When someone says Apple Watch, the first thing that comes to the minds of a lot of people is fitness. And this makes total sense, considering Apple mostly markets the health features of the watch. However, there’s a lot more to this smartwatch than just tracking your activity, workouts, and the data revolving around them.

                    <span>大家好，我是《秦时明月》的执行制片人薛小明。首先还是对各位喜欢《秦时明月》的秦迷朋友表示感谢。《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》十五周年版，已经播出第三集，相信大家都看到了一段精彩的打戏，不知道看得过瘾不过瘾。相信大家从中也能看出，我们在这个版本上花费的心血。

对于这部作品的意义，正如沈导之前回答提过，这次的十五周年版是在《秦时明月》播出十五周年之际，答谢秦迷和观众朋友的一份回馈。为了更好的效果，这次《新秦时明月》的制作也有很多不易，除了用我们最新的技术提升了画面的质感和各方面的细节之外，我们还进一步提高了打戏的观感。对一部武侠作品来说，打戏毫无疑问是至关重要的。而与注重特效的影视作品不同，《秦时明月》一直是那种“拳拳到肉”的写实武学实践者，相信看完第3集的观众就更能够感受到这种风格。

这一集的打戏占比是比较高的，从前面无双与项家子弟的切磋，中间少羽和无双单挑，到最后危急关头盖聂的一剑救场，可以说既还原了我们第一部的经典剧情，又增加了很多亮点。在武戏上，我们着重表现人物的特色以及更真实的打击感、紧迫感。为此，我们加快了打戏的节奏并尽可能的展现出角色见招拆招的设计，比如少羽和无双的这段打戏，无双的特点是力量强又有着钢筋铁骨，一旦被他抓住就很难脱身反击，所以少羽更多是依靠身法的灵活躲闪去进攻他的薄弱部位。且不管是无双还是少羽，所做出来的很多组合动作以及运镜都是经过不断地调整，同时是连续镜头，这样可以看出人物的连贯动作。

为了这些效果，我们的武戏部会与我们的动捕演员深入交流，所以武戏这方面，我们确实是花了很多力气去做。我想这也是秦时明月传统武学的魅力之一。
在正片的最后，大家可能注意到这是一段在旧版《秦时明月》中没有出现过的镜头，即盖聂找到天明并保护他的这段回忆。这段回忆是我们对剧情细节的一个补充，也是为了让盖聂这个角色更立体。相信通过这些细节的补充，可以让观众对盖聂为什么会叛离秦王宫的原因有了更多自己的理解。

这一集中主要涉及到的点就是以上这些，后续的剧集中还会有更多精彩丰富的内容呈现，希望大家能够多多支持我们。在此也感谢粉丝和观众为我们提出的建议，之后我们一定会继续努力，为大家带来更好的作品。

                    <span>大家好，我从2006年进入游戏行业，长期从事开放世界游戏开发的美术及技术美术工作。对于游戏内容生产工具以及研发流程管线方面，我有着长期使用以及开发经验，直接参与过多个知名AAA游戏的研发，同时也支持其他研发团队的工作。来到天美技术中心后，我正在负责技术美术工具流程和技术方案的研发、推广落地以及技术支持。
近几年，开放世界游戏项目遍地开花，开放世界游戏的海量内容对数字内容设计和生产带来了两个大的挑战：一是内容制作量的大幅提升，二是内容品质提升，包括美术的高品质，丰富多样性、独特新颖性等要求。这两个挑战促使游戏从业者研究探索更多新的技术工具和工作流程来应对。
程序化生成是国内游戏制作方面的热门话题，还记得我曾参与制作一款海外大型开放世界游戏，当时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能比较简单，一个开放世界关卡美术可以制作和迭代一平方公里的关卡地图。
而两年后，我又参与了另一款开放世界游戏的制作，此时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能已经被迭代优化，一个关卡美术可以制作五平方公里的关卡地图。从中可以看出，先进的工具和流程，对提高数字内容生产效率的助力非常明显。
程序化生成通过在工具中设置一些程序化规则，去自动生成游戏内容，确实能在一定程度上提高制作效率。完善的工具和流程使得团队能够高效地制作出很多规模宏大且高品质的游戏内容，但是近些年，程序化生成工具和流程也逐渐显现出了一些限制和弊端。
首先，程序化生成的内容往往比较重复和单调。程序化生成通常由技术美术或者技术动画，通过观察归纳总结现实世界的现象效果，来制定生成规则，但是现实世界的丰富性和多样性会使得完全原样重现的规则过于复杂或者代价太高，所以在实际过程中，我们通常会简化规则，而简化规则以后，自动生成的效果就会丢失很多细节和变化。
举一个例子，在真实世界中，植被生长和分布的因素很多，例如降雨量、温度、湿度、经纬度、海拔、光照、风向、土壤环。而当我…</span>

                    <span>回答此问题前，我们可以先看看，其他传统形式是呈现科幻题材的好载体么？
郭帆的影视团队对中国科幻的工业化影视改编做了拓荒性质的探索，团队选取了刘慈欣《流浪地球》这篇2.2万字中篇的其中一段进行了改编。从电影工业化来看，它的置景、服化道和特效真正做到了对叙事的辅助和增强（甚至还在半途成立了UI部门来解决呈现问题），他们的努力使得电影的世界可信、幻想合理，作为当代科幻电影可以说是合格了，但不少观众会批判其人物和剧情过于套路，而另一些观众则认为其格局过小、背离原著精神。
《爱，死亡与机器人》是以动画短篇形式对科幻呈现的探索，第一季18集中的16集背后都有科幻小说原著支撑，包括广受好评的《齐马蓝》。不少观众喜欢其恢弘浪漫的视觉表达和返璞归真的禅意，但原著中作者阿拉斯泰尔·雷诺兹还有一层探讨，是关于记忆的载体，由肉体记录的不稳定记忆和由机器记录的精确记忆，究竟哪一个才是人之为人的关键。有些科幻读者与学者惋惜于这部分探讨被完全抹去，但也有影评人认为这一取舍令此作品封神。
对于最近刚刚上映的《沙丘》意见分化更是严重，路人观众对于一群掌握空间旅行技术的人用冷兵器打群架十分困惑，认为其节奏缓慢、剧情拖沓。但也不乏喜欢其美术风格者，和包括我在内的对其精准还原了原著风貌与精神的科幻爱好者。
而最近火热的“元宇宙”概念，最早来自尼尔·史蒂文森的《雪崩》，这一科幻概念的落地已不再局限于单一载体，而是涵盖了多样载体与技术的现实社会。当然，有人认为这是人类发展的未来，也有人认为这个概念被过度解读，变成了什么都能装的口袋概念。
除此之外，《诗云》的广播剧、《三体》的舞台剧、《闭环》改编的剧本杀《星落五丈原》、综艺节目《火星情报局》等，都是对科幻题材落地形式的探索，但孰优孰劣，相信每一个欣赏体验过的人都有不同的看法。
 


对于游戏载体，这些问题也同样存在。

                    <span>不知不觉在游戏开发行业已过十年，从刚入行的技术小白，到现在依然什么都不懂的技术搬砖工，见证了一个时代的游戏技术变革。我本人先后做过游戏开发SDK，端游MMO，休闲手游，重度手游，大世界手游，大世界端游等各品类产品，现在是天美F1工作室技术中台引擎程序团队负责人。
游戏行业发展很快，玩家对游戏的要求越来越高，游戏对技术的要求也越来越高，开发量也越来越大。我现在所在的天美F1工作室正在开发3A级全平台的大世界游戏，这是一件非常具有挑战的事情。
本人作为游戏引擎程序，深知技术更新之快，需要不断的学习才能接受这个挑战。所幸我们已经提前在多个方向积累了对标国际3A大厂的技术能力，并且还在全球招募了不少具有3A项目研发背景的各方面人才。通过不断的夯实技术基础，我们有能力也有信心接受新的挑战。在我们储备的技术中，PCG的技术是目前大世界游戏必不可少的一种技术，现在做一些简单介绍。
PCG（Procedural content generation过程化内容生成）技术是最近比较热的提升游戏生产效率的一类技术。它是什么意思呢？
网络百科给出的答案：过程生成（英语：procedural generation）是计算机科学中一种使计算机自动制造一类数据的算法。在计算机图形学中，它也被称为随机生成，常用于制作材质贴图和三维模型资源，并在电子游戏领域中用于自动制造大量游戏内容。过程化生成有着减小文件体积、扩大内容量、增强游戏随机性等优点。
我个人的理解：如果在游戏中应用，简单说，过程化内容生成就是利用算法来自动生成游戏内容。原有的游戏内容需要美术和策划花费大量的精力制作，过程化的方式可以大大降低人工成本，除了可以节省一些重复的人工劳动之外，甚至可以自动创作出一些新的设计内容。试想如果有一个程序可以自动生产游戏，那是多么有意思的一件事情，也许那天到来，游戏开发者都下岗了。

                    <span>作为社恐人士，看看我这小眼神就知道我是自愿回答的！


因为直到开播前都很兴奋，所以前几天都没怎么睡，思维到现在都还有点乱，就随便闲聊下吧。


我们跟腾讯动漫算是合作很久了，他们在我们大火鸟还没什么名气的时候就给了很多机会，加上这次能得到《大王饶命》这个项目，真的很感激也很开心。


我还记得当初ASK老师和我第一次说这个项目的时候，我就觉得这是我们团队的荣耀，而且碰巧ASK老师和肘子老师还有我三个都是白羊座,生日还刚好挨着，就觉得这缘分也太巧了。


说来有点不好意思，在还没见到本人前，我以为肘子老师是那种特别严肃的老人家，没想到碰面后反而有种一见如故的感觉。于是我就追着他问了很多关于小说创作的事，一番交流下来，我算是深刻地领会到了什么叫头部作者。


光是我们这几个小时的聊天就足够让我学到了很多平时压根不可能注意的故事创作细节，而且他最厉害的就是可以在极短的时间里想到一段非常有意思的梗，大王第一话开头的吕树怼糖葫芦师傅就是肘子老师几分钟内蹦出来的创意，真的是让人非常佩服。


话说回来，虽说能接到这个项目很让人兴奋，但兴奋劲过头随之而来的就是不安了。因为这部小说的知名度很高，加上肘子老师对我们的期待很高，所以我们必须拿出全部实力去完成它才行。


最终在燃尽了全部精力后，作品顺利上线了，从那刻起，我心里的不安也就渐渐消散了，真心希望大家能够喜欢上《大王饶命》的动画版。


说起动画版的亮点，这两天被大家热议的OP肯定是一个重头戏。实话实说，其实我并没有刻意去做什么布局之类的、与创作无关的事。我只是给了一群爱玩的朋友一个足够的空间，让大家可以在其中尽情玩耍，玩得开心。


我确实没想到会火到这个程度，毕竟我每次做OP/ED的初衷就是让创作者尽情表达自己的创作欲，我相信只有完全释放激情和灵感的作品才是好作品。这也是我为什么特别喜欢跟无念聊创作的事，因为每当我跟他聊起OP时，我能够感受到他眼里是有光的，这是他真心喜欢做的东西，就像他说在制作过程里并没有遇到什么太大的难题，反而更像是水到渠成。


至于正片内容，对我来说比较难的是如何让吕树的怼人场景比较贴合我们的现实世界，因为如果过度追求搞笑效果的话，很容易就会变成那种烂大街的搞笑喜剧。然而这部作品的内核并不是搞笑，所以我们最初开始制作的时候就定下了偏写实的方向，只有这样才能让吕树这个角色显得更加立体。在初期讨论时尤其让我最印象深刻的是ASK老师说“麻烦导演你把第一季做的穷一些，要那种从里到外的穷感。”


真是让人头大.jpg。


一部好剧肯定少不了好细节，我们现在每次要制作新作时，在正式开始前都会去相关地点进行场景、道具的取材，《大王饶命》也不例外，这次为了构建出吕树的房子，我们收集了相当多的资料，所以最后出来的场景美术设定所有人看了都很满意。比较可惜的是我们没能赶上庙会的时间，所以没能体会到原汁原味的庙会氛围，有点可惜。


除了吕树的房子外，像是比较重要的学校场景也在精心收集了很多资料后对它进行了高度的还原，尤其是道元班的设计，我是真的苦恼了很久，最终才定下了方案。而且因为疫情的缘故，在取材结束后我们就匆匆回到了广州，在那之后因为各种原因也没能再去一次，所以后面的很多场景就只能参考之前拍的照片，通过回忆和讨论尽可能地还原了。


最后，再次感谢腾讯动漫，谢谢肘子老师，给了我们这次参与《大王饶命》动画化项目的机会！

                    <span>写在开头
其实笔者本不想探讨关于《一人之下》中人战力高低的问题，因为这类问题往往会沦于骂战，但是看到题主的这个问法“十年空窗期打掉一众十年修为的”，笔者觉得有点意思。
就在此处做一个小小分析，希望各位读者在看待一人之下中的战斗时能够从更多方面去考虑，也算是抛砖引玉了。
先说结论——打架要靠脑子的
张楚岚到底有多强？并不强。
其实细细分析，张楚岚的各方面纸面战力其实都很一般，刨除个别本来就不擅长战斗的同龄人外(没觉醒双全手的吕良），甚至说可以比同龄人还略弱。
但是真正面对战斗时，还包含很多因素，比如战斗智商、心性果决程度、布局算计以及悟性。
而这些非纸面战力，都能够在具体的战斗中扭转乾坤，改变局面。

何谓纸面战力：
包括功法、修为年限、战斗经验、对各门各派功夫的熟悉程度以及肉体和灵魂的强韧程度。
那么张楚岚的纸面战力怎么样呢？
张楚岚现年19岁（虚岁），出生于1997年2月4日，由于并不知道张楚岚是几岁时候得炁开始修炼的，但是参考同龄的诸葛青7岁得炁开始修炼。张楚岚只能更早，假设是在5岁（2001年）。

张楚岚7岁时，张怀义过世（2004年甲申年）。他就停止了修炼，连静功都停止了，从而瞒过公司，一直以普通人的身份活到了19岁。


那么张楚岚的修炼总时长为：2001年-2004年期间，满打满算4年时间。

功法：
金光咒、雷法、老农功【相比其他门派的功法略强】
修为年限：
4年【同龄人10年起步】
战斗经验：
4-5次（罗天大醮期间）【同龄人大多有各门派切磋学习，经验远多于此】

对各门各派功夫的熟悉程度：
龙虎山本门（只教授了术法，没解释含义）、藏龙提供的少量其他门派情报【同龄人大多会有同门长辈传授经验典故】


肉体和灵魂的强韧程度：
由于并非训练肉体的横练或者是性命双修的全真龙门，张楚岚的肉身强度为一般水准，但是灵魂的坚韧强度在同龄人中是出类拔萃的。【同龄人被擤气攻…</span>

I Hate You

SZA

[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y&#x27;all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping &#x27;bout your whereabouts
I can&#x27;t keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don&#x27;t want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can&#x27;t shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin&#x27;
Heavy on the missin&#x27; you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain&#x27;t no findin&#x27; us
I&#x27;ve been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to makе me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just likе this?

[Verse 2]
Used to be too solid &#x27;til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent &#x27;til you ambushed me
Now I&#x27;m out here wildin&#x27; with you
Now I&#x27;m out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin&#x27; boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don&#x27;t ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin&#x27;
Heavy on the missin&#x27; you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain&#x27;t no findin&#x27; us
I&#x27;ve been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape &#x27;Life B4 Fame&#x27; with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.</span>

Continuing from our last post, I talked about how ANSI Game Engine is a colourful telnet server. We left off with needing to fork the engines telnet server.
Time to level up our telnet server and make it multi-player with some knify forky.

I&#x27;ve added in the strftime identifier from Perl&#x27;s POSIX module to help with time stamping the output. The setsid identifier is for starting a new session and group ID for each forked process. A.K.A, the child process. :sys_wait_h is for returning without wait after the child process has exited, using the WNOHANG flag when calling waitpid(). This provides non-blocking wait for all pending zombie children.

A machine learning (ML) model is only as good as its input data. In a world of inequity, developers must ensure they build responsible models void of bias.
Introduction
What is algorithmic bias?
Societal harm
Closing thoughts
As artificial intelligence (AI) begins to integrate itself into daily life, it’s essential that the technology be created for equitable and ethical use. Creating a responsible product is essential and failure to do so can have very real consequences. While neutral in theory, algorithms are at risk to become as biased as the world they were created from.
Algorithmic bias occurs when computers make systematically biased and unfair decisions based on the data they&#x27;re given. AI has the power to be a tool for the implementation of diversity and inclusion in many fac…</span>

Microsoft launched the fully managed Azure service for performance test engineers and developers to perform high scale load testing called Azure Load Testing, currently in preview mode. It is quite a big announcement for performance engineers. Let us see whether Azure Load Testing fulfills our needs or not in this blog post.
What is Azure Load Testing?
As foretold, aptly put, Azure Load Testing is an offering for the customers who are in the Azure ecosystem. Even if you are not in Azure, you can still spin up the load test resource for performance testing. But the catch is, PRICING. We can discuss the pricing in another blog post.

                    <span>One of the advantages of using containers is the ability to have images with our environment pre configured and ready to go with our application code. These images is what allows us to run a container on our laptop and then run the same image on a container in the cloud. But building this images is not a trivial task, and we tend add useless tasks or overhead to the images we create. This entry is to share some of the best practices that has work for me in the past when building docker images.
First of all we need to define what a docker image is. A docker image is a unit of packaging that may includes Operating systems constructs or packages, application dependencies and libraries and application code.

That&#x27;s why the minds behind Range are on a mission to keep teams connected, focused and productive no matter where they&#x27;re working.
Dan Pupius, CEO and co-founder of Range, joins us this week to discuss the need for better, more collaborative tools as work becomes increasingly team and project based. Dan believes software development was the vanguard to the 21st century work model: when a distinction between &#x27;normal&#x27; work and hybrid work will no longer exist because all work will be hybrid work.

                    <span>It was the first day in my last year of tech high school. The new programming teacher arrived and stood silent for a second, and then he started the lesson:
This year we will create a state machine with persistence using C++. This state machine will be a light-bulb that can be turned on, or off.
We all just look at each other thinking &quot;ok, that will be easy&quot;... and then he dropped the bomb:
There&#x27;s a catch: You&#x27;ll not be allowed to use if or for for it.
Now the class was clearly confused. Flow control is one of the first things we all learn as programmers. The main objective of that teacher was to teach us that we need to stop thinking conditions as if, repetitions as for, and so on, and instead be more abstract with the logic on our code. In JavaScript we have:

                    <span>In 2021, we launched product improvements and various community initiatives to help the academic research community succeed in their research studies with Twitter data. In this post, I present a recap of all the API launches and programs - from Twitter as well as the academic research community - that has made it easier for researchers to do research with Twitter data.
Launched in January 2021, the academic research product track is one of the biggest updates to the Twitter API v2 for the academic research community. It provides qualified academic researchers free access to the full-archive of public Tweets (previously, academics had to use the paid premium API to get Tweets older than 7 days). In addition to access to the full-archive search functionality, academics get 10 million Tweets …</span>

西班牙巴塞罗那的圣家堂大教堂，本周在尖塔顶端安装了一颗12角玻璃星，将在新年前夕被聚光灯照亮。这座建筑是联合国世界遗产，已经造了130多年，估计还要好几年才能土建完工。（via）
本周话题：低纬度，高海拔，气候优势
上个月，我在四川旅行。离开成都以后，一路向南，就到了攀枝花。
那是一个很奇特的地方，气候与周边截然不同。

从成都开始，就一直是阴天，但到了攀枝花，天天都是阳光明媚的大晴天。而且很暖和，当时已经是10月底，北方都下雪了，那里白天的最高气温却还在25度以上，可以穿短袖。
总之，天气好得让人怀疑。我就去查了，果然是有原因的，大家看下面这幅中国年平均气温图。

上图中，颜色越深，年平均气温越高（越热）。注意看，在成都和昆明之间，箭头所指的地方，有一块异常的深色区域，气温显著高于周边，比南边的昆明还要高，接近西双版纳的颜色（温度）了。那就是攀枝花。
为什么这里气温高？
书上的解释是，主要原因是独特的地理环境，这里是 &quot;低纬度、高海拔的盆地&quot;。纬度低，接近北回归线，所以冬天不冷；平均海拔1000米以上，所以夏天不热；
更主要的是，这里地处金沙江河谷，周围都是高山，空气不易流动，风比较小，所以比同纬度的地方更热。而且，高山挡住了水汽，所以很少下雨，晴天多。

（图片说明：旅馆窗口望出去的景象，城市被高山包围。）
这样的地理条件，使得冬天的气候非常舒服，暖洋洋的。当地政府现在把康养产业（养老）当作主要产业，一到冬天，大量外地人口涌入过冬。
仔细想一下，国内符合&quot;低纬度、高海拔&quot;这个条件的城市，没有几个的，可能都在云贵高原。这些城市都非常…</span>

引言
作为一部手腕上的计算设备，Apple Watch 能给我们的生活带来很多方便。遗憾的是，Apple Watch 本身的操作逻辑还有很大的改进空间。
例如，从初代 Apple Watch 一路用上来，我始终困惑于为什么操作手表始终需要用到两只手：你必须把佩戴手表的手腕端正抬着，用另一只手在表盘的方寸江山上指点。
即使是在双手空闲的情况下，这么操作也会显得窘迫，更不要提撑雨伞、提重物这种一只手被占据的情况了。（用鼻子或者下巴点过屏幕的读者请举手。）
这个问题终于在今年得到了解决——尽管是通过一种「曲线救国」的方式。在 watchOS 8 中，Apple 将多种新的「辅助功能」带到了 Apple Watch 上，其中就包括 iOS 用户熟悉的「辅助触控」。
在辅助触控的帮助下，用户可以用捏指、握拳等手势代替触控操作；换言之，用一只手就可以使用 Apple Watch 上的所有功能。
先来看看 Apple 的官方介绍视频：
 
是不是颇有些「呼风唤雨」的魔术色彩？
诚然，「辅助功能」的设计初衷是方便那些有肢体不便的用户，但这并不意味着普通用户不能从中受益；从某种意义上说，「一只手被占用」本身就是一种肢体不便的情形。本文中，我们就将介绍如何利用这一新增的辅助触控功能，单手掌控 Apple Watch。
注： 请注意「辅助触控」功能仅适用于 2020 年起推出的型号，即 Apple Watch Series 6 或以上，以及 Apple Watch SE。
开启手势和基本操作
启用 Apple Watch 的辅助触控功能其实只需简单几步。在 iPhone 上打开 Watch App，进入「辅助功能」&gt;「辅助触控」，然后打开「辅助触控」开关。接着，点击「手势」，再打开其中的「手势」开关。

@SHY：时间是 2011 年，舞台是美国佛罗里达州。空条徐伦在与恋人兜风途中遭遇交通事故，而后被律师与法官联手陷害，因谋杀罪获刑 15 年，押入别名「水族馆」的州立绿海豚街重警备监狱。束手无策之际，徐伦却从父亲空条承太郎托付的护身符中觉醒了不可思议的力量。然而，将家族秘辛和盘托出的承太郎，在营救徐伦越狱时因失去主角光环遭到敌人暗算，沦为失去替身和记忆的植…</span>

                    <span>作为不记账就会焦虑星人，我在使用 iPhone 时曾大力赞扬 MOZE 这款记账应用，不是因为 MOZE 有多强大或多完善，而是它具备了许多特别人性化、符合实际情况的功能细节。
在回归 Android 平台后，我一直在「吹毛求疵」般寻找记账应用。可无论是大厂知名产品还是无数来自独立开发者之手的优秀作品，使用起来它们都有地方会让我皱一下眉头——并非是不够强大（有的产品甚至可以用于资产管理），而是缺少了那些贴心细节。所以当我体验到小星记账时，那些细节让我产生了一种「平行时空里的我开发了这样一款记账应用」的错觉。
基础功能常规但足够好用
从应用本身来看，小星记账仍然是常规的记账工具，它将账目概览、账户信息、统计报表这三个核心功能分成三个页面展示，低频和进阶功能则收纳进了侧滑菜单，整个记账流程足够顺畅，账目类型、金额分类以及附属信息在一个屏幕中就可以完成，结合规范的 UI 设计，日常使用使用起来逻辑感很强。
不过有几个地方也能看出来小星记账有它自己的想法，比如它没有像大多数同类产品一样提供日历视图，以及它将四则运算收纳进了数字键盘的二级菜单中，记账老手们应该会比较不习惯，不过体验一段时间之后我发现，这两个功能似乎并没有我想象中那样常用。

记账是为了了解自己的消费习惯，所以定期查阅详单和报表非常重要。小星记账在报表方面的逻辑也非常明确：概览和图表一目了然、详单可以通过筛选查看。小星记账也提供了收支差额（可以看作结余）的计算，另外每类图表下方还会「一言以蔽之」简要概括这段时间的财务状况。详单部分也比较完善，对应大类、小类、账户或者不同时间段的结余详单都能查看到。最近一次更新后小星记账在搜索功能中新增了「高级筛选」，用户可以通过自定义时间、金额、分类、账户等等信息筛选对应账单，完全可以满足我们统计和对账的使用需求了。

除了常规功能，小星记账支持报销管理和周期事件，更新后也在记账页面提…</span>

                    <span>按：今天是 12 月 3 日，国际残疾人日。根据世界银行的数据，全球约 10 亿人患有某种形式的残疾。
诚如联合国在今年纪念活动的说明中指出，技术和创新越发促进着可访问性（accessibility）和可用性（usability）；辅助设备和辅助技术对于残疾人士发挥着关键的「促进平等」作用。其实，早在 2006 年，联合国通过、中国参与签署的《残疾人权利公约》就承认，获得辅助技术是一项人权。
在少数派，我们关注技术，也强调包容。在内容出品中，我们重视推广无障碍设计、介绍辅助工具的选题；与读者互动时，我们常常感动于那些虽然视听、行动不便，但依靠坚忍与才智活出别样精彩的故事。
值此残疾人日之际，我们特将网站中无障碍相关的优秀内容以合集形式呈现，希望为促进无障碍方面助人和自助的意识和技能，略尽绵薄之力。

一、无障碍技术综合讨论
怎样打造互联网「无障碍」

互联网为很多人打开了认识世界的另一扇门。对于残障人士来说，互联网不仅仅是丰富生活的方式，更是为了让他（她）们全身心投入到工作、生活、沟通、聆听、创作的桥梁。那么，为了实现这种互联网「无障碍」，厂商、社会组织都做了哪些努力？信息无障碍应当满足哪些标准？不同操作系统的无障碍设计和教程资源应该去哪查阅？本文一一为你解读。

我们为什么要关注包容性设计

包容性设计（inclusive design）是「一种能够充分利用并实现人类多样性的方法」。它包含无障碍设计，但又高于无障碍设计。世卫组织指出，残疾是一种个人属性，不仅仅只是健康问题，而还是一个环境问题，反映了身体特征与社会特征之间的相互作用。因此，每个人都可能在某种场景下成为「残疾人」。这篇译文从设计角度出发，探讨了包容性设计的实践方式，但对于任何用户都可以产生启发和触动。

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

游戏本身就是一种互动娱乐，我非常鼓励读者通过评论互动参与进来，而不是仅仅当个「读」者。
享乐
推荐好的游戏音乐，希望更多人因为音乐对游戏产生兴趣（我就是）。

                    <span>奥密克戎一发现就得到世卫组织的最高待遇，其中最关键的原因就是奥密克戎变种与原始的新冠病毒相比变异的地方特别特别多。
奥密克戎至少有32处变异，而之前的德尔塔不过是2个变异。
但这里我需要澄清一个广泛存在的误解，所谓的32处变异指的是通过基因测序，但这并不代表奥密克戎的刺突蛋白的外形的变化一定就会大过德尔塔。

大家好，我是坐标蒙特利尔的 Gilles Beloeil，是一名有近 20 年经验的美术从业者，如今在天美 F1 工作室担任概念美术专家。

蒙特利尔一直以 AAA 研发领域的人才密集和产业成熟而知名。过去数年，许多世界各地的游戏开发商来到蒙特利尔，在这里研发游戏，其中也有越来越多中国游戏公司的的身影。
对身处蒙特利尔的从业者来说，中国游戏公司在规模和投入上的准备程度是以往很少见到的。这种投入往往意味着可以打造极好的团队，而好的团队是好作品必不可少的。中国研发工作室的到来无疑为蒙特利尔注入了新鲜血液。

就我个人而言，决定加入天美是个天时地利人和的故事。此前，我在育碧蒙特利尔待了近 15 年的时间，有意尝试新的项目和环境。
天美蒙特利尔工作室的 AAA 项目恰好是我感兴趣的类型。深入交流后，我发现双方志趣相投，也都希望打造一部好作品。综合考虑下，我来到了天美蒙特利尔，这里的一切正处于启动阶段，充满挑战与活力，让我感觉非常兴奋。
目前，我负责为游戏设计概念图，探索游戏的美术风格和基调。由于仍在项目早期，所以人数尚少的概念美术团队可以充分发挥想象力，互相交流与克服困难，相互尊重专业，氛围非常融洽，我觉得这是个很好的开始。

AAA 游戏的概念设计
大家也许会好奇，AAA 游戏的概念美术设计过程是怎样的。其实并没有想象中复杂，我仅分享自己的一些个人经验。
概念美术设计的第一步，往往是从美术总监处，得到关于设计需求的简报。我会根据这份简报，去尽可能提出问题，理解对方想要的画面。在这之后，我会去寻找各种参考素材，主要用于以下层面：设计，氛围，配色，光影，构图，灵感 …… 进而我要决定用什么路径方法。

而路径方法的选择，取决于概念图的类型和目的：是用来展现氛围，还是具体设计？是游戏故事中的…</span>

                    <span>大家好，又是我。
我是《大王饶命》的动画监制askask，感谢大家对这部动画的关注，希望大家喜欢这部动画。
关于原作
 我在知乎也混了挺长时间了，感觉知乎的网文用户还是挺多的，所以第一个问题就先来说说原作吧。
其实我并不能算是一个传统的网文读者，除了很多年前追过一阵子紫川这种极早期作品之外，中间一直都没有关注过网文作品，《大王饶命》这本书老实讲也是因为工作相关才开始看的，但没想到一看就喜欢上了。那已经是几年前的事了，其实因为这本书我才去下载了起点app，然后这几年开始越来越关注新的网文作品，也追更了很多新的好书。
熟悉我的朋友可能知道我是一个极老极老的“老二次元”了（可能是很多人阿姨辈的那种），这本书给我的第一印象就是非常适合“二次元”方向的改编，不管是人设、剧情、战斗体系的设定等各方面。熟悉国漫的朋友应该知道我们现在的动画改编还是有很大比例是倾向于使用3D制作的，但《大王饶命》这本书我是看完之后马上确定了使用2D制作，并且很快敲定了现在的动画制作团队，简直是太合适了。
在制作中原作的改编其实有两个比较大的难点：一是搞笑，二是战斗戏。关于搞笑的问题上其实我们纠结了很久，可能更多的原著粉在看书的时候脑补出来吕树的怼人和比较贱的态度是会比较直接和更有冲击力的那种，但从人物的长线塑造和剧情角度考虑，我们还是处理成了现在的风格，前期PV放出的时候也注意到有些原作粉感到有些意外，但相信慢慢看下去，大家会逐渐理解我们的用意！而战斗戏份则是我们这一季重点打造的部分，尤其在后半进入遗迹之后，会有大量非常大规模的精彩战斗场面，为了这部分的制作导演已经跳楼几次被人民群众抬了回来（不是），最终还是让原作者替他摔断了腿（纯属胡扯）。没有啦，不过头发掉了大概有几车应该是真的。

关于OPED
这两天提前放出的OPED相信大家已经看到了，也掀起了不小的反响。

                    <span>从07年初到现在，已经快15年了。还在这一行。就从我自身的经历说说行业这些年的变化，以及未来的趋势吧。
第一份工作是在完美世界，进去的时候公司还叫完美时空。那时候全国比较知名的游戏公司是盛大、九城之类的代理公司，大型的游戏开发公司还是很少的。完美时空那时也只有200多人，上线的项目只有完美世界、武林外传、诛仙。直到我入职半年后公司才在纳斯达克上市，随后迅速扩张起来。
那个时期可以说是3D端游刚刚在国内兴起，只要有技术能做出画面不错而且网络稳定的3dMMO，市场基本是随意收割的状态。完美当时采用的快速复制新产品抢占市场的方式，虽然被诟病为完美七胞胎，但确实是最适合当时国内游戏市场的打法。

当然，好日子没几年就开始变了，入局MMO的公司越来越多，一次重要的转变是史玉柱的征途登场，买卖数值的模式越来越成为网游的收入重心，自动寻路等小白的操作和刺激玩家PK也渐渐取代了探索大世界的游戏内容为主的设计方式。

另一个则是完美的老对头畅游的崛起，天龙八部的活动玩法和卖宝石等也迅速成为跟风对象。这两家京城游戏公司互相挖角也堪称一乐，双方的核心骨干基本都对着换了N次家。
这个阶段大概持续了五六年左右，在业内的体验基本是MMO游戏的画面技术在提高，但设计整体在下沉化和氪金化。对那些怀着初衷要做暴雪式游戏的国内开发者来说，大多会感觉日子越来越不好过和行业世风日下。然而谁能想到再过几年真的暴雪也要黄了呢。
但是随着竞争的激烈，因为大家都做了活动、卖数值，pk，社交这些容易模仿的下沉设计，这些设计也很快失去了异军突起的效果，于是大厂也出现了一股下血本提高品质的浪潮，不再急于推出项目，而是反复打磨游戏内的画面、战斗、副本等内容，以靠近国际水平。这时候有代表的作品比如腾讯的斗战神，西山居的剑3，网易的天下，完美的笑傲江湖等。如果按这个趋势发展下去，中国的端游确实是有可能走向国际3A的道路。

                    <span>先说结论吧，在射击游戏的领域，游戏策划的门槛确实在逐渐提高。工作以来我一直在从事射击游戏的设计，快8年了，我自己也是FPS游戏的重度爱好者，能把爱好与工作完美的结合也是一件幸运和开心的事儿。那么就从射击游戏领域的游戏策划工作，聊一聊这些年面临的一些挑战吧。

射击游戏一直是游戏的一大分支，从TGA近5年的获奖者来看，包含射击元素的游戏几乎占据了半壁江山，‘枪车球’的地位显而易见。并且每隔1-2年，都会有突破性的射击游戏产品诞生，TitanFall、OW、PUBG、2077等无一不给玩家带来相当程度的震撼。而像COD/BF这类超高质量的年货产品，更是牢牢占据领先的位置。射击品类可谓百花齐放。
 


而作为一个非常成熟的品类，在全球研发领域，射击游戏已经有了近30年的研发历史，无论在设计理论、技术成熟度和生产管线上，都已经有非常惊人的积累。国内的射击游戏研发真正爆发，也大约是从BR（BattleRoyal）时代开始，越来越多的工作室投入了射击品类的研发，而国内最早一批自研射击游戏的项目，可以追溯到2008年大连金山团队的反恐行动，到逆战迎来了更大的影响力，紧接而来的手游时代将竞争战场转向了移动端。

短短不到10年，国内的厂商通过努力似乎来到了弯道超车的拐点，但在移动端的超越更多是来自“端转手”的红利，随着越来越多的端游在移动端移植完毕，真正考验作游戏设计者的创造能力/设计能力的时代慢慢来临，能够脱颖而出的产品越来越难，尤其是在全球化市场的竞争中，新的手游甚至要以端游的品质或体验为目标，才能在这个时代获得成功。

天美J3工作室在移动端做出了《使命召唤手游》《穿越火线手游》这样的射击游戏作品，在玩家和市场上都取得了不错的成绩，一群热爱射击游戏的人一直在这个方向积累深耕。
随着射击品类的快速进化和走向全球游戏市场，我们也在布局新的产品方向，在开放世界、写实大战场和风格化游戏等领…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是 Steven Rhee，韩国人，是一名坐标北美的灯光美术（lighting artist）。个人曾在 EA 和动视等公司任职，积累了 15 年的游戏光照设计经验，目前加入天美洛杉矶工作室，从事 AAA 项目研发。我不懂中文，所以请天美同事帮忙翻译，给大家分享一些我的看法。
大家也许已经注意到，中国游戏厂商正在全球各地成立工作室，招募当地的 AAA 人才。在我看来，这本质是研发全球化的必然趋势，而且西方早就开始了。
过去十年，游戏已成为当前科技领域最关键，最具创新能力的行业之一，为全球近 20 亿人提供了极具沉浸感与惊艳感的娱乐形式，也让“娱乐产业（entertainment industry）”这个词不再限于指代好莱坞和电影。
随之而来的是，游戏研发的规模在不断扩大，尤其是对 AAA 级游戏而言，幕后成员往往超过上千人，需要多个工作室合作开发，才可能将游戏在规划期限内完成。早在许多年前，Rockstar Games、EA、育碧等厂商就已经开始在本土之外布局研发团队了。

经过长时间的积累，不管是从中国市场还是全球市场看，中国游戏研发进展迅速。面向全球市场，中国游戏行业自然向着 AAA 游戏研发领域扩张。游戏公司也在通过全球化研发布局的方式扩充人才池，提升团队多元化程度，来建立自己的竞争优势。
在个人层面，我认为研发人才加入新的开发环境是件很正常的事情，特别是受到资源、能力、决心的吸引。比如我，在跟天美接触中没有过多犹豫，我觉得加入天美会极大地帮助我个人的成长。
全球协作研发和团队多元化
我曾在 EA 和动视工作，负责多款游戏的光照效果，包括《星球大战：前线》以及《麦登橄榄球》，《战地》和《极品飞车》等系列。
其中的 13 年里，我一直都是《麦登橄榄球》系列的灯光主美，因此与 EA 上海工作室有过多年的协作研发（Co-dev）经验。

协作研发有不少优势，比如说…</span>

                    <span>我从事游戏行业17年，先后任职于上海育碧和蒙特利尔育碧, 从PS2，Xbox时代的游戏开始，经历了PS3，PS4，Xbox 360，Xbox one等的变迁，也参与过多部当时所谓的“次世代”作品，比如《幽灵行动》，《I am alive》，《细胞分裂》和《孤岛惊魂》系列等等。做过关卡，VFX/shader TA，技术美术总监，期间负责过多个项目重大对外节点（如E3，gamescom等）的攻坚。
接触天美J3还是2019年的时候，当时美术总监 @BrianTao 和技术总监 @Shadow 找到我，给我展示了目前在研的几款游戏，我为手机上能呈现如此的品质而惊叹！
要知道出国前我对手游的印象还停留在《愤怒的小鸟》和《部落冲突》这类休闲品类上。之后我们又谈到了工作室今后的规划和发展，“大世界”，“工业化”是提到最多的关键词，这也正是与我过往的经验和想做的事不谋而合！
由于疫情关系，我最终在2020年底回国，有幸加入了天美J3大家庭，目前担任技术美术负责人。
说到工业化，虽然我经历过多款AAA“次世代”，但是从游戏的内容量品质，团队人员配置和流程上讲，它们同样有着天壤之别。行业也已经在过去这段时间里经历了几次重大革新。  记得早些年，在主机上（如PS2，Xbox）开发第一人称射击游戏，团队规模往往在百人以内，开发周期在1年左右。开发流程上也非常线性和简洁明了，比如游戏分为多个关卡，每个关卡由各自的关卡设计和关卡美术负责，在技术美术总监的指导下，效果得到艺术总监认可，性能在规定范围内就可以了。
至于里面的细节，只要不是违背大的技术框架，可以由该关卡的负责人按照自己的习惯就行，而资产（source data/raw data）管理，流程管理等也并没有规定得那么死板。在开发中遇到的问题，可以通过非常灵活的定向研发的方法逐一攻破。

                    <span>很多年前我在知乎给过一个论述，今天再稍微做一次复读机：
工业水平决定爆款上限
受众特质决定爆款呈现
囿于写这个论述的时候，我对于游戏产业的工业化其实理解是有一定偏差的。所以今天我对这个论述稍微修正一下：
在创意行业中，工业水准决定表达形态。
当然还是要说明，我自己并非游戏开发，本职工作现在更接近发行；很多涉及开发本身的事情我的回答会显得班门弄斧，请大家多多指正。
-
如何定义工业化？
我的定义就是在项目上建立高效的自动化系统，拥有成熟的开发技术栈，优化的开发工具，并利用成熟的系统高效地生产游戏内容。
工业化其实更多是生产方式的区别，重点在于效率的提升，而并非是产出的游戏本身的大区别。——在这个意义上来说，某些大作其实并非工业化生产，或者最多是纺织工人用上了珍妮纺织机，但离真正意义上的工业化生产，还有很多距离。
回归到问题“如何看待工业化对游戏产业发展的重要意义？“本身，在这个回答中，我想谈三个事情。
其一，是产能的提升。
产能其实是两个维度，第一是能做什么，第二是同样的时间能做多少。
实际上是存在一个反-工业化的叙事的。那就是“小作坊”生产。而大家都在鼓吹工业化生产，或者至少认为工业化生产是一个好东西的时候，我们面临的现状是大多数的游戏开发都以小作坊式生产为主。
这个倒不是说大家条件艰苦云云，而是说开发模式还是以堆人力，怼资源的模式为主。
在这种情况下，决定产品上下限的，都是团队整体每一个人的能力。在这种情况下来说，人员的稳定性和能力水平就非常致命。
同时，团队能力的下限也在非常大的程度上决定了你能做什么样的东西。
而开发的工业化在一定程度上是能够解决这个问题的，成熟的开发管线可以让内容的生产效率更高，也让内容生产更不依赖于某个/些特定人才。
这点在于游戏产品质量需求提升明显的今天，是尤其重要的：尽快完成开发工业化的厂商/工作室，一方面能够更快的追随市场的喜好，生产表现力更强的游戏产品；另一方面则显然能够有更大的腾挪空间，对市场的适应性更高。
其二，是管理模式的改变。
工业化的生产，势必引领更工业化的管理模式。这点在逻辑上还是很明显的。产能提升其实能够显著避免micro-management。项目管理的重要性也越来越多。
倒不是说某一种或者某几种项目管理模式就一定行。但以往关键角色一言堂的情况，在更高的产能下，其实会有一定的衰减——因为在高产能的环境下，leverage资源比对项目直接bb要更紧迫。
囿于我本身并非管理者，所以我对于这点的诠释并不全面。但我能够清楚且欣喜地看到，工业化能够带来的是更先进，也更能发挥每个人能力的管理模式。
其三，则是成本以及行业场景的远期变化。
有群友回答说，未来的游戏行业会有明显的两极分化现象。这点我非常同意——但是原因跟工业化的生产方式其实关系不大。更多的原因在于需求的变化：即使是在F2P领域，玩家亦需要表现力更佳的“大”游戏。
诚然，对于多数厂商来说，将自己舒适区内的开发模式更替为更工业化的开发模式，确实会有段时间的成本上升以及转型的阵痛。但长期来看，工业化的产能是能够在一定程度上降低成本的。
君不见EA，Ubi等等海外开发商，即使在海外他们的人力成本已经跟国内持平甚至更低了。但单纯从开发能力来看，国内还没有哪家公司敢说他们比海外厂商强的。
更近一步讲。即使对于个人/独立开发者来说，工业化体系下催生的产品，也会对他们的开发提供便利——君不见，Unity的普及让我们其实前所未有地容易开始做游戏了（当然真不真的去做又是另一回事）。
这最终导致的是游戏开发的商业电影-艺术电影分化，不肯找到自己真实地位的厂家被大浪淘沙。

                    <span>感谢邀请。确实，从目前趋势看，国内各大游戏厂商和工作室都陆续在海外布局，在海外设立自研工作室并大力引进海外高端人才。海外工作室的建立，可以一定程度上进行产能扩容，减轻游戏内容的研发压力。
更重要的是，海外一线专家的加入，可以带来老牌游戏开发商在高品质内容生产上的方案和经验，对于快速完成生产管线改造和核心研发能力升级上有比较大的参考意义。对于国内游戏厂商来说，加入全球化研发无疑是加速团队成长与探索AAA生产模式的机遇。
但挑战总是与机遇并存，全球化研发的趋势对游戏研发团队和个人，都会带来更多新的要求。不论是国内的游戏工作室，还是海外游戏厂商，目标都是建立“快速量产AAA品质游戏内容”的能力。只是各自的原始积累不一样，努力的方向也不尽相同。
对于我们来说，想在游戏研发全球化的大趋下守住优势并脱颖而出，不论在技术与工具的积累和探索上，还是在生产模式的摸索和迭代上，都应该以兼容并包的心态，吸收国内外的先进经验，快速建立自己的产研优势。
我们工作室在技术革新和前沿探索上一直比较积极，我自己也经历过数次大规模的技术升级和管线改造，目前也在负责新项目的技术迭代的规划和落地，可以分享一下我们在这个过程中的想法和经验，希望能提供给大家作个参考。
准备一：搭建工业化管线 — 流程标准化与生产自动化
随着玩家对高品质游戏内容量的需求增长，未来精品游戏项目的研发必然需要超大规模团队的承载和支撑，也呈现着跨地区多团队配合的趋势。这也正是全球化研发的本质。
跟单一团队生产不一样，跨地区多团队的联合研发，对于生产流程标准化的要求会非常高，以避免低效沟通带来生产成本的极大代价。
海外厂商在多地团队联合研发上有其经验和优势，值得我们借鉴和学习。 同时在游戏内容生产方面，自动化生成代替纯人工生产也将成为大趋势，通过程序化的方式可以大幅减少在内容生产上的人力成本，并提高整个项目的研发效率，以适应市场的快速变化。…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计专家Inkling，年轻人都喜欢叫我in老师。我从剑3开始职业生涯，在腾讯J3参与过逆战和穿越火线手游，可以说，国内原创科幻游戏的星星之火正是由我们这拨人点燃的。
我从小喜欢画画，更是个资深游戏玩家，从04年走出校园踏足游戏圈到现在，见证过国产游戏辉煌的成功，投身过行业中激烈竞争的战场......既然说到游戏美术的竞争力，我有些简单的想法想和大家分享。

这个问题之前，我觉得先需要回答下什么是游戏美术，什么是美术。如果一说到游戏美术，大家只能想到引擎和渲染的话，那这个行业未免有点无趣。
美术是一个大概念，游戏美术和其它几千年传统行业的美术，没什么本质区别。
做的都是让 —— 大到世界，小到物件 —— 的外表“好看”的工作。
让东西变好看的能力，每个人都有吗？如果我有这样的能力，怎么才能比别人更强？
我觉得可以从三个方面去说：执行，判断，观点。美术的竞争力就是提高自己这三个方面的优势，游戏美术也一样。

执行
执行就是实际美术工作的熟练度，执行力就是控制的能力。控制的能力就是让元素出现在它们该出现的地方，能够让色彩不乱，线条漂亮。疏密关系、明暗对比，这些已经是老生常谈，真正落到实处的时候，就是经验和练习量。
基础的战斗力，没有太多大道理可讲，选择行业需求的方向，尽最大可能花费时间锻炼。不管是软件技能还是绘画技法。所谓一万小时定律，说的就是机械的能力，而机械的能力就是靠机械的时间积累获得的。
实际执行能力的竞争，无非就是投入时间的赛跑，同样资质的人，多投入时间的一方一定会胜利。资质不好怎么办？那就投入更多时间试试。同时也要注意，专注在一件事上是对的，但是也需要留意其它领域，一专多能 vs. 一专，永远有优势。

判断
判断就是能知道什么是好看的，什么是不好看的，有审美。这个已经超越了美术范畴，审美和一个人的知识储备和阅读量密切相关。
我们不可能期待…</span>

                    <span>我是在传统老牌的西方 AAA 公司工作 15 年后加入中国游戏研发工作室的，我结合自己的观察和体验，尝试回答这个问题。
近几年，中国的游戏公司有很大的变化，逐渐向重视原创、追求更高品质、打造具有中国文化特色的游戏产品转变。最近经常听到这样一句话“中国游戏玩家的口味越来越高，国内的游戏公司也开始卷起来了。”
“卷”这个词用在这样的语境下，我认为不是件坏事，它代表着随着市场需求的变化，中国的游戏厂商对于品质的重视程度变得越来越高。
国外的 AAA 厂商已经这样“卷”了十几年了：游戏的画面越来越接近影视化，内容丰富度和体量越来越高，争相进行技术上的探索和突破，同时创新的作品也层出不穷。我很高兴看到中国的游戏公司也以这样的方式“卷”起来，让中国的游戏产品在各个维度上与国外的 AAA 大作掰一掰手腕。

我相信这样的转变，对于许多海内外从事 AAA 游戏开发的人才选择加入中国游戏公司，是一个至关重要的前提。 
AAA 游戏的开发是一个先慢后快的过程。一个非常有经验的 AAA 游戏团队，也可能要花费 1-2 年的时间来完成概念和创意方面的探索，2-3 年左右的时间进行试生产（Pre-production），这里主要包括设计方面的验证和技术管线的搭建。
所以，经常会出现游戏开发了 4、5 年，看起来却只有一个垂直切片以及一大堆白盒和临时资源的情况。但接下来会是神奇的一段时间，通常 80% 的游戏内容，都是在最后的 1 年到 1 年半时间里完成的。
这种“神奇”有一个前提条件，就是整个团队可以沉下心来，完成前面提到的创意设计和试生产环节，否则最后的全面投产（Full-production）将会是一场灾难。
每一部 AAA 游戏的开发都是一趟漫长的旅程，耐心，信心和决心三样缺一不可。而我已经在国内的游戏厂商中看到了这三样东西，所以我回来了。

                    <span>游戏是我从一而“衷”的选择。我大学毕业就一头扎进了游戏行业，从业至今，由一名普通设计师成长为主美，大约16年多点。这份选择从最初到如今或是将来，都不会变，所以在这里，我用了衷于初心的“衷”而不是终点的“终”。
游戏和动漫是我的两大爱好。与很多80后一样，在成长的时光里，我都是在棚里看别人玩《魂斗罗》，或是在街机厅打《街霸》中度过的。记得在作文作业里，我还写过一篇从8位机开始一路到当时的SFC 32位机的游戏主机发展史这种让老师一脸懵逼的作文。所以，我自认为一直是一名游戏爱好者。但可能喜好更偏向于动作，冒险且有剧情的游戏类型。
与此同时，我对动漫的热情也从未减少。因此在读书阶段，自己的休息和考试奖励基本都是被允许画漫画和游戏里的角色。后来，我有了让中国动漫形象席卷全球的愿望。这个愿望或许有些太大了，但自己始终在期盼这一天的到来。
大学毕业答辩时，我的论文题目是《如何推广中国卡通形象》。当时我感觉国内在这块的整个产业链还不完善，想要从动漫衍生出高认知，高流传度的形象或是文化理念会比较缓慢。所以在论文里，我是把游戏这样一个商业化相对成熟的产品放在第一推广位，然后再同步动漫周边等。这也是为什么我会直接选择游戏行业而不是其他行业。
入行后，我在第一家公司做的是手游，现在自己仍在开发手机游戏，感觉有些事情可能确实讲究点机缘。加入腾讯之前，除手游外，我还参与过PC和各类掌机，以及08到11年期间所有主流主机游戏的开发。但始终我都在做欧美向的设计。
直到进了腾讯，我才真正开始参与到国人自己的游戏研发中去。然而在刚开始的时候，我参与的项目在美术风格上依旧是偏欧美的。
直到2012年末，我在天美开始参与第一批风格全民化的微信游戏开发。从那时起，通过一个又一个的项目，我才逐渐将自己的美术风格往亚洲审美上靠。
最终在17年8月，我们研发的国风战争策略手游——《乱世王者》顺利上线了。（以下简称《乱世…</span>

                    <span>Old or new to the crypto world, you have probably already met with some cryptocurrencies. But how about creating one? That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do in this tutorial.
First, what is ERC-20? Some kind of android? No! Besides the difficult name, it is just a protocol to define what basic structure, rules and functionalities your fungible token (like crypto currencies) must have to properly interact with the world. But good news! You don&#x27;t have to write it from scratch, because OpenZeppelin already has a bunch of secure boilerplate smart contracts written and audited by the community developers, so you just have to import it in your code and extend your contract so it inherits the ERC-20 basic properties and methods.
To properly interact with the world your token needs some basic rules, such a…</span>

                    <span>After solving a Advent of Code challenge by treating the input as a program last year, I wanted more this year. The opportunity came today and I decided to take it. Instead of Parlet and Ruby, though, I decided to use Elixir/Erlang tooling to get the job done.
In the Day 2 this year you need to pilot your submarine. This is done by a series of commands, such as this:
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2

We have a command, followed by a number - one pair per line. There are three commands:
forward moves the submarine horizontally by number


down moves it down, increasing the depth we&#x27;re at
up does exactly the opposite of down



A series of commands - that&#x27;s a program! To execute it, we need basically 3 things: a lexer, a parser and an interpreter. Fortunately, Elixir gives us…</span>

                    <span>&quot;To become a Web Frontend Developer, we can never survive without Computer network knowledges. Frontend is never solely about Javascript or CSS. We work closely with network protocol and http request daily&quot;
1. Common HTTP request that we will use
2. Inheritable and non-inheritable properties in CSS
3. HTTP respond Header 
4. Common HTTP respond status code 
5. Key differences between HTTP&#x3D;1.0, HTTP&#x3D;1.1, 2.0

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

                    <span>Using Lottie animations is an easy and popular way to add animations to your app to have that modern look and feel. All sorts of companies use Lottie animations, from startups all the way to the big boys, such as Google, Microsoft, Spotify, and Netflix to name the few.
Using LottieFiles you have a choice to make your own animations using Lottie Editor, buying animations from creators on Lottie Marketplace or using Free Animations to get LottieFile(s) completely free of charge to add them into you project.
Unfortunately, Lottie animations cannot be added directly to SwiftUI view without some work prior to that. In order to add Lottie animation to SwiftUI, you need to implement UIViewRepresentable protocol which is a wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate Lottie view into your Sw…</span>

                    <span>Starting with a new framework can be really tedious sometimes. Don&#x27;t get me started about the starter files you have to build. 
In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to set up tailwind css easy peasy, without having to dig too much through the internet. We&#x27;ll start from making sure you have node installed in your computer, easy/awesome terminal tricks, right down to making sure you are set to start using tailwind in your code.
Side note: You do not need any knowledge of node to use tailwind. We&#x27;ll just use it for necessary installations.
To check if you already have node installed, then run the following command in your terminal.
node -v
If node was previously installed, then it should display the current version after you hit enter. If it wasn&#x27;t, then you&#x27;ll have to install node. You can get…</span>

                    <span>Optimising code for high performance can be exhausting; where can you squeeze that last bit of speed out of your code? How can you be faster than that one piece of code you found online?
For that, let&#x27;s take a look at the following example of our Rust crate:
pub fn new(values: &amp;Vec) -&gt; MathVector {
    let mut len: f64 &#x3D; 0;
    for i in values {
        len +&#x3D; i * i;
    }
    MathVector { values:    values.clone(),
                 dimension: values.len(),
                 length:    len.sqrt() }
}

Among other things - like the for loop for example - one thing is the problem. Can you spot it? The answer is: len.sqrt(). Getting the square root of a number is performance-wise extremely expensive - how should we get rid of it? You might guess, that we could implement something like the…</span>

                    <span>Since starting as a full time SWE, I&#x27;ve found myself using multiple note-taking apps:
Notion. Mostly use for meeting notes. I love the organization and search features. I love that you can add attendees and other properties. But the tablet app is painful to use with a stylus. And because it&#x27;s so structured, I&#x27;m less likely to add notes that don&#x27;t fit in a predefined section.
Samsung Notes. For daily tasks and reminders. This replaced the Cambridge Quad notebooks I used to buy in bulk. I bought a Samsung tablet, and now I&#x27;m stuck. The handwriting recognition is the best of multiple apps I&#x27;ve tried. Unfortunately the people at Samsung make it impossible to access and edit your notes on desktop or the web.
OneNote. Which I&#x27;ve been trying to use because it&#x27;s there and easy to save random screenshots to. But the lack of basic editing features and plugins sucks. The forced notebook and page structure is also pretty limiting. I hate clicking around to find notes and the view easily feels cluttered.
Random sticky notes. For random thoughts, customer service case numbers, git commands to refer back to, etc.
I would love to use one app that does everything these 4 apps do:
Organize my notes into groups and structures that I can easily search and get back to
Be workable on tablet. I&#x27;m not asking for much here. Just let me take notes. Recognize my handwriting and let me edit on desktop or the web.
Simple interface that doesn&#x27;t inhibit random notes or reminders I want to jot down.
Someone suggested Obsidian. Never used it before, but would love to get some feedback from those who have. If there&#x27;s another app that you swear, please let me know!

                    <span>A product&#x27;s ability to capture the user&#x27;s attention is crucial, and dynamic prompts/notification is one such efficient way to engage users.✨
It allows you to communicate with users by directing their attention to the navigation bar and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for announcing business news, showing off the best features, generating leads, and so on. 
This article will guide you step by step to build your own Dynamic Prompts/Notifications bar. 👩‍💻
We used React for the frontend, Canonic for the Part backend.

Lets start with creating a new react project - Use create-react-app

Next, to create a basic skeleton, just edit src/App.js

I asked a question whose answer I would like to share. I am not a professional transcriber or translator, so take that into account when reading the following answer.
Adolfo Neto: Do ​​you particularly prefer statically typed or dynamically typed languages ? If it were just for taste, not for saying what&#x27;s better or worse for developers.
José Valim: Dynamically typed. I agree a lot with the response from the creators of Erlang. When someone asks &quot;why isn&#x27;t Erlang statically typed?&quot;, a lot of people say it is &quot;because the theory for statically typing ever…</span>

@南鱼祭酒：realme Book 海岛灰
买这种手机厂商推出的首款笔记本电脑，是需要一定的勇气的。对于我来说，做勇士，其实是一个明确自己需求的必然结果。

购买渠道：realme 京东自营旗舰店
入手价格：4399（原价 4699）
下单及签收日期：10 月 27 日下定金，31 日付尾款，11 月 1 日发货，3 日收到

我一直有台式 Windows 电脑兜底，所以在笔记本方面只需要考虑轻薄即可。上一台 win 本是 vaio z，在 19 年底的时候 C 面有一点点鼓，就送回京东返修了（京东自营，我作为京东 plus，不修白不修），结果京东表示修不好，可以按购入价八折赔付给我，然后机器销毁。用了一年半的笔记本能有这样一个结果，对于消费者来说显然很值了。于是在之后的一年时间里，我的移动设备就变成了一台华硕的 Chromebook 和 iPad Air 第三代。这样的组合在家里当然无所谓，但是一旦要出门，一旦要出门而且要跟他人进行文件交换，Chromebook 和 iPad 的不足就体现出来了。恰逢苹果推出了全新的 M1，于是我在 20 年年底斥巨资购入了一台 MacBook Air M1 16+512（官网 24 期分期免息，四舍五入不要钱……）。
但是，在接下来的将近一年时间里，我发现 MacBook 并不适合我。

最值得称道的高性能 M1，我用不上。笔记本在我这里主要作用就是文档编辑器 + 浏览器，M1 杀鸡用牛刀了。
高续航我用不上，甚至轻薄我也用不上。我在今年（21 年）4…</span>

                    <span>12 月 2 日，App Store 正式公布 2021 年度 App 奖项。与去年一样，今年的 App Store 年度 App 奖项分为「年度 App」「年度游戏」「年度趋势」3 个部分；不同的是，今年的年度 App 奖项由过去的「App Store Best of」正式更名为「App Store Awards」。
在 App Store Awards 2021 奖项名单中，每个部分各有 5 款 App 获奖，获奖的开发团队同样会收到一块由 Apple 设计和制作的实物荣誉奖牌，奖牌背面会刻上获奖者的名字；奖牌由 100% 可回收再生铝合金制造，设计灵感来源于 App Store 的蓝色图标。

注：以下 App 仅标注 Apple 生态支持平台，部分应用和游戏还支持更多平台，你可以自行前往 App 官网进行了解。
年度 App
在年度 App 奖项中，我们能够看到许多少数派读者的「老朋友」，比如之前多次介绍过的笔记工具 Craft 以及天气应用 CARROT Weather 等等。
年度 Mac app：Craft

App Store

以精致设计和动效著称的新兴笔记工具 Craft，在推出的一年多时间里获得了 App Store 与国内外媒体的多次推荐，也是 少数派评选出的 2020 年度 App，也在今年获得了 Apple Design Awards「交互」主题奖项提名。

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

年度 iPad app：LumaFusion

                    <span>如果是 Steam 忠实老粉，那么 Wallpaper Engine 你应该也不陌生。这款 Windows 的动态壁纸软件，可谓是把 Windows 桌面和 Steam 社区强大的生产力结合在了一起 —— 桌面壁纸动起来了，似乎也给 Windows 增加了一份动感。不然，每天盯着死气沉沉的 Windows 方格视窗，也真的是有些腻。
不过如今，Wallpaper Engine 也登陆 Android 了。
熟悉的配方，熟悉的味道
在 Android 设备上，Wallpaper Engine 默认仍然保留了几个经典的壁纸，比如「Fantastic Car」「Razer Vortex」和「Neon Sunset」。这些壁纸也都为移动设备的屏幕大小做了优化，同时可以在应用内一键设置为锁屏或者主屏幕壁纸。难能可贵的是，桌面版对于壁纸本身极高的自定义程度也在 Android 版本中得到了保留：以 Neon Sunset 为例，用户可以自定义各种颜色、比例以及播放速度，自定义程度完全不输 PC。
除此之外，移动端 Wallpaper Engine 支持「对运动作出反应」—— 你可以选择让壁纸根据手机陀螺仪读取数字的变化而变换，有点儿像 iOS 的「透视」效果；也可以通过在不同主屏幕之间切换来滚动显示（比较适合横向的动态壁纸）。

此外，Wallpaper Engine 在 Android 上也支持通过播放列表的形式自动更换壁纸。在主页的某一款壁纸上长按，就可以把它添加进入播放列表。播放列表可以设置为按照顺序播放或者随机播放，并且可以设置每款壁纸持续的时间。
当然，我们也可以选择设备上的 mp4 视频、gif 动图或者是照片等，来通过 Wallpaper Engine 创建自己的动态壁纸。说不定你可以把自己家猫的卖萌视频做成壁纸，再加入播放列表循环播放～

                    <span>视频简介 &amp; 打字音 🎥
 
文字版 📝
在上周刚拿到这把少数派定制的联名 Keychron K3 并简单拍了段视频分享到一些社交平台之后，不出所料，我收到了蛮多相似的疑问：
「为什么我们还需要一把矮轴机械键盘？」
和传统的机械键盘相比，矮轴机械键盘确实算得上是个新事物，从罗技 G913 把这类产品带到主流市场以来也不过三四年时间。但另一方面呢，不管是 TTC、凯华还是佳达隆，国内几家轴厂也都相继推出了矮轴产品。所以我们第一个话题，就来聊聊矮轴键盘到底好在哪。

虽然伴随着游戏和电竞行业的大热，机械键盘席卷外设圈十多年，但仍然有不少用户坚守着薄膜键盘的阵地：相比于前者主打的指尖爽感，也有一部分人对于更轻松快速的输入体验更加在意。
直白点说，不管是线性还是段落，传统机械轴体 4mm 左右的键程在长时间使用之后是会有一点「腻」的，所以为了结合机械轴体和薄膜键盘各自的优势，矮轴机械键盘诞生了——保留了机械轴的触发原理，但是大大降低了轴体高度和按键行程，使输入体验更加贴近薄膜键盘的轻松高效，同时也保证了一定的机械键盘的手感。

我拿到的这把少数派定制 K3 是佳达隆矮青轴版本。在相比传统轴体大幅缩短的 2.75mm 键程里，这把键盘依然可以感受到清晰紧实的段落感，之后也有足够的键程来完成柔和的触底，而不至于像薄膜键盘一般在「敲钢板」。偏大的回弹力度也比较符合我的喜好，段落声更是短促且清脆（打字声实录可以参考视频 3：35 处）。
当然手感是一件见仁见智的事情，矮轴的诞生姑且算是给了部分用户追求敲击感时一个折中的选择。在此之外，这类产品还有另外一个显而易见的特性，也正是这个特性使其进一步对应了非游戏人群的办公需求——肉眼可见的轻薄使得矮轴键盘类产品在便携性上有着得天独厚的的优势。

相信我派有不少存在如此困扰的读者——对于经常带着笔记本电脑甚至是 iPad Pro 出差并且码字比…</span>

前言｜拍完的照片怎么办
拍完的照片怎么办？这个问题困扰了我很久。
长久以来，至少对于业余摄影师，朋友圈、即刻、图虫等等就是照片最终的归宿。我后来发现更糟的是，翻来覆去不过是换个平台传上去而已，最多一周以后就再难有人问津，包括自己。想想连家里那些落灰的旧影集，时不时还会被拿出来翻翻，我就觉得这些新鲜的记忆不能埋在网络里就算了。
我不专门学摄影，也相对少交流，过去几年都在瞎拍，这种草根性一定程度上影响了我了解「摄影集」这一概念的进程。从「影集」变成「摄影集」，好像专业度提高了不少。
绕了很多弯路，也庆幸得到了很多帮助，我最终完成了。搜了搜我派上没有系统的教程，仅有一篇 @kokdemo 前辈所做的台历教程，读后也觉得受益匪浅，经历了许多相似的困难。我许久没码字了，这次抛砖引玉但从头到尾地聊聊怎么做一本摄影集。

挑选｜重新翻一遍库存
作为一个毫无资历的小法师，我无法指导大家拍摄，更多是如何挑选一系列适合放进摄影集的照片。如果你一直有非常好的图片管理习惯，那么这一步就会非常容易。要是没有的话，做本摄影集其实也是个很好的开始，挑选的过程本身也是图片管理的过程。

在中国现有的五座“世界美食之都”里，顺德是最特殊的。澳门的后缀是“特别行政区”，成都、扬州、淮安的后缀都是“市”，只有顺德的后缀是“区”。看起来，顺德似乎天生就比其他四位低上一级，更像一个“小地方”。很多人不知道的是，站在顺德区背后的，是佛山市——如果说顺德这个“小地方”，是粤菜皇冠上的明珠，那么佛山，就是皇冠本冠无疑。由高明濑粉、禅城柱侯牛杂、西樵牛奶浸鸡、大良野鸡卷、勒流水蛇羹、九江煎堆、三水蛋散、白坭冬瓜盅、伦教糕、石湾及第粥、盐步秋茄、三洲烧鹅、均安蒸猪、陈村粉等等所组成的佛山版“报菜名”，不仅反映了这里丰饶的物产和讲究的烹饪艺术，更彰显了深植于地理人文之上的，源远流长的饮食传统。

在大多数人眼里，佛山是一座与黄飞鸿、叶问、李小龙高度绑定的城市，在文弱谦退的中国南方，它是少有的，被打上了尚武、悍勇标签的地方。一个不易察觉的细节是，这三位“武林高手”，似乎都没怎么饿过肚子：黄飞鸿十六岁开设武馆给人授艺，生意始终兴隆，早早当上了老板；叶问十七岁赴香港读书，接受西式教育，电影《叶问》一开场，他就过着喝茶、练武、住别墅的神仙日子；而李小龙，则从出生起就是美国华侨，在移民热土旧金山的独栋独院里长大。在那个多数中国人都挣扎在贫困线上的年代，这三位佛山人毫无疑问是“人上人”的代表。



事实上，有钱有闲、生活洋派，不仅是黄飞鸿、叶问和李小龙的个人状态，更折射了佛山地区一直以来的富庶和开放。佛山的地理位置很特殊，珠江最重要的两大支流：西江和北江在此交汇，它们带来了南岭山区的大量腐殖质，并冲击出一片河网密布的巨大三角洲。相比上游城市清远、肇庆，佛山的土地平旷而肥沃；相比下游的江门、中山和珠海，这里又因为远离海洋而没有海蚀侵袭、土壤盐碱化的困扰。对农耕文明来说，这是一块不可多得的宜居区。

                    <span>是否有领导力，可以按照领导力的定义判断，这里给出一份领导力模型的参考，主要包含做「事」、做「人」以及整合「人」和「事」三个层面

「事」的层面
核心能力1： 项目推动能力（关注问题识别和推动执行，强调对外）
子维度包括： 

敏锐洞察：随时了解竞争对手和业内同行的动态，敏锐识别市场机会和风险，通过分析性、阐释性、评鉴性思考，集思广益，解决问题；制定的方案经得起时间的考验；善于发现创新想法。 
追求成效：具有不屈不挠的进攻精神，不达目标绝不放弃，坚定不移地推动自己和他人为取得成效而努力。 

核心能力2：任务分解能力（关注资源调配和规划分解，对内） 
子维度包括： 

目标分解：围绕任务目标，组织下属制定计划、分解目标，讨论和优化工作开展方式，使效率提升并保障任务的完整执行。 
资源整合：面对市场机会，果断决策，合理配置人力、物力、预算等资源，指导并带领下属团队以最快的速度达成目标。 

「人」的层面
核心能力3：沟通和跨部门协作能力（对外）： 
子维度描述： 

沟通能力：以积极主动、换位思考的思维方式和娴熟的沟通技巧，妥善处理与他人的关系，促成相互理解，获得支持与配合。
组织影响力：针对组织内外部情况，使用复杂的策略方法，产生影响，营造良好的内部工作氛围和外部合作环境，以完成工作目标。 

核心能力4：人才培养能力（对内）： 
子维度描述： 

选才育人：慧眼识人，发现和关注有潜力的员工；付出时间和精力支持全公司的高潜力人才发展。 
组建高效团队：通过授权、激励等管理手段充分发挥团队成员优势，促进团队合作，解决人员冲突，激发团队成员的动力，营造良好团队氛围。 

整合「事」与「人」的专业精神
核心能力5：专业精神
子维度描述： 

把事情做到极致：不断挑战更高标准，超越目标，在互联网领域创造出更为持久和非凡的成就。 
拥抱变化：面对复杂多变的外部环境，不畏难、不退缩，主动调整、寻求改变，引领团队朝着新的具有挑战性的方向转变。 

正如领导力大师约翰.科特所说，“管理是确定具体的计划，然后配备人员等组织资源，并监督和控制执行过程；领导则是确定长远的方向，联合群众朝着此方向前进，并激励和鼓舞他们。” 领导力不是领导的专利，领导力是一种影响别人的艺术。所以，我们每个人无论职位高低，无论是否管理者，都可能随时在某种场合扮演“领导者”的角色，影响我们身边的人，都需要“领导力”。

                    <span>动画明天就上线了。
本来我还兴高采烈的准备追更，结果腿突然摔断了，只能躺着追更了……
很多人会私下问我，动画好看不好看，大家都以为我是看过了的，其实没有。
我还没有看过动画，只是制作的过程里看过一些分镜，参与了剧本的创作。
我始终认为，专业的事情一定要由专业的人来做，我虽然是原作者，但我擅长的是文字表达，而不是动画语言的表达。
对此，我是完全的信任监制、导演、创作团队。
现在，我作为原作者，其实就像普通观众在等新番一样，比较激动。
昨天看到op之后更激动了。
这个op是我近几年看过最好的，从作画精致程度、设计之巧妙，都让我眼前一亮。
而且，我还自己参与了一部分作词……
如果有个什么“年度最佳op”的评选，我感觉这个op一定可以入选……
当初刚与腾讯动漫、大火鸟合作的时候，他们就专门来了洛阳。
一开始我还挺担心沟通会有问题，毕竟行业里资本支配原作者的传说屡见不鲜，哈哈。
但后来发现我多虑了，监制ask和导演少爷都很好沟通，都是超级有意思的人。
沟通基本就是在吃吃喝喝、欢声笑语里结束的。
其中聊了怎么把握大王饶命里的人物关系，怎么把握搞笑元素的呈现方式，剧情脉络。
大家都很尊重原著，甚至过于尊重原著。
我一直在跟他们聊，原著从文字转换动画，肯定要有所改变，所以未必要全都按照原著来……
但ask和少爷对此很谨慎，他们怕丢失了原著的味道。
所以总体来说，整个动画制作过程对我来说，是开心且愉快的。
最后，希望明天动画上线后可以大火大爆哈哈，毕竟我献祭了一条腿，一定要制霸一整年！

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
在之前的文章里，就提到过勇士的防守死穴：对上真正顶级天赋的大个子，他们的体系会被强拆。这也是勇士以夺冠为目标情况下，面临的最大隐患。而今天对太阳的比赛里，这种更多停留在“讨论”阶段的隐患，终于露出了危险的一角。全场比赛，在防守端，108.3分的百回合失分也远差于大样本下联盟第一的100.4分。
而将勇士的防守打到这个地步的，是布克或保罗的挡拆持球攻吗？布克只打了15分钟，保罗的回合占有率也只有18.2%，并没有像惯常预计的那样，接过布克留下来的球权，包揽一场比赛的进攻。真正让勇士无法防守的，是中锋艾顿，打出了远远超出常规赛20.2%水平的30.1%回合占有率，真实命中率也保持在57.8%，而他的得分方式却并没有比平时有所进化，83.3%都来自于油漆区，且两分球受助攻率72.7%，依然是我们印象中的那个出手范围较为狭窄的篮下终结点。

更多需要控球手“喂饼”的艾顿，常理上讲似乎不应该成为勇士防守的障碍，反而是勇士最喜欢的那种进攻方式。本赛季的勇士，将小阵容提到了常规使用的程度，正牌中锋鲁尼只有18.3分钟的时间，18.8分钟的奥托波特、14.9分钟的别利查，分别在五号位打了53%和100%的时间。这套小阵容对上线持球人的压制能力极强，几乎可以在任何对位中都不被抓住防守弱点，且可以兼顾到对侧翼的轮转。对持球人的局部空间以人数压缩，对侧翼依靠轮转补位，外扩的防守风格可能出现的篮下空虚问题，则由对持球人的传球线路的封锁来缓解。由此，勇士便做到了对对手进攻组织与串联的切割，对发动机有重点施压，对弱侧也有人员顾到，让对手无法通过个人威胁与顺畅传导盘出足够合理的进攻回合，被迫打成高难度的单打和出手。
本赛季，勇士有53.9%的防守回合处在篮下15FT以外，集体外扩程度排名联盟第四。而在效果上，与勇士对阵的球队场均只能拿到21.6次助攻，联盟第四，被防到42.…</span>

                    <span>其实把“野外露营”和“精致露营”作为对比选项，就像把“西餐”和“水果”拿来对比一样，在概念的内涵和外延上，怎么说都有点“差辈”。


基本上，露营可以分为三种：


第一种，Bushcraft露营，更倾向于荒野求生。
Bush是澳大利亚对森林的称呼，Craft则是技能的意思。所以Bushcraft也就是那种住山洞，或者拿树枝搭个窝棚，最不济带一块油布搭个避难所的露营。

这是回归原始生活的一种露营，什么现代化工具都没有，什么钻木取火了，什么用树皮做绳索了，什么拿木头挖陷坑了，玩就玩最野的，没有足够的知识、经验、体魄、意志，是做不到的：
赤身裸体户外露营，夜晚如何取暖御寒_哔哩哔哩_bilibili

当然，在国内，怎么钻木取火荒野求生，那都是动嘴的，实际上绝大部分Bushcraft爱好者连公园都没睡过，真动手的都是买买买，什么2000块钱的英国手工斧子，什么1500块钱的美国煤油灯，什么3000块钱的瑞典柴火炉。没钱的就买什么战术鱼钩、钛合金火柴盒啥的，逐渐沦为COSPLAY艺术、手工艺品收藏，和YY了。

这其实不是Bushcraft露营，而是Bushcraft风格露营，也就是牛奶和牛奶风味饮料的区别了。


另外从环保的角度说，古人这么露营是没办法，从现代露营的角度来说，明明是从大都市开着越野车进林子，明明有20块钱、200多克一个，一个能用两天的气罐不带，非要带好几斤重的斧子去乱砍树木，破坏环境，就为了烧起一堆柴火感觉很炫酷，我个人是对此相当持保留意见的。



无痕山林的准则，不说全都对，但既然你要去露营，最好还是要了解一下：
1.事前充分的规划与准备，
2.在可承受地点行走宿营，
3.适当处理垃圾维护环境，
4.保持环境原有的风貌，
5.减低用火对环境的冲击，
6.尊重野生动植物，
7.考虑其他的使用者。





第二种，经典露营/常规露营。

Welcome to another Marley Rainbow Six Siege best funny moments video, full of waffle, one taps, aces, and clutches... But the main focus is trying the new meta, not shotgun meta, but the sniper meta! Operation High Calibre is out but before we try out the new operator Thorn and the new gun, the Uzi, I wanted to see if we would vibe with Kali and Glaz.</span>

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are not FOUR hunters but FIVE instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost AND my friend awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It&#x27;s a race, and it&#x27;s super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we&#x27;ll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

                    <span>Introduction
Push notifications are alerts that are &quot;pushed&quot; to a user&#x27;s device by apps, even when those apps aren&#x27;t open. In the case of web push notifications, the web app receives messages pushed to it from a server at any time. This includes when the application is active or inactive or not open in the browser and when the browser is inactive. Firebase Cloud Messaging is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send these messages at no cost.
In this tutorial, we are going to be walking through how to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging to receive web push notifications in your React.js app.

                    <span>If the mobile app doesn’t correspond to the latest design trends, it will probably be out of users’ interest.
Making the app look modern and beautiful is challenging, considering that trends never stay the same, and there is always a new trend to appear. But following the design trends is a must for every app developer.
We understand that It is not always possible to keep track of all the tendencies and trends in the industry. There are always new guidelines, animation content, video, new approaches to illustrations, and many other concepts you need to find time to study and test first.
We have completed this task for you and collected 10 top design trends and ideas to use in 2022 and make your apps’ design stand out:

                    <span>Tailoring a user experience for different devices can get complicated. There are many approaches to rendering a different view for mobile, tablet and desktop users.
This post presents a way to offer a tailored render for different breakpoints in the same component.
The benefit of this approach is useful when you need to render the same content components in an app and have them render a specific set of HTML based on viewport size.
Firstly, the breakpoints need defining. This sets the viewport widths and the render function to use at this breakpoint.
const breakpointConfig &#x3D; {
  reactive: false,
  breakpoints: {
    992: { method: &#x27;renderTablet&#x27; },
    768: { method: &#x27;renderMobile&#x27; },

                    <span>Sometimes mining can seem to be too complex for the average computer user, so I thought about putting together a quick guide to get you excited about mining cryptocurrency and LINK in particular.
Anyone can start mining Chainlink LINK with any laptop in under 5 minutes using this guide, regardless of your technical skill level you will be able to increase your crypto knowledge and start mining LINK with your CPU and GPU today!!
Chainlink is a decentralized blockchain oracle network like Tellor built on Ethereum. The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts.

Continuous integration, continuous development, and ANOTHER CD. As expected in DevOps fashion, the two CDs are often treated interchangeably. In reality, they need to be set apart as their own processes. If organizations want to be bleeding edge and match the productivity of large corporations like Amazon, Facebook, and Google - hopefully not their arguably unethical coding practices - they need to embrace all three facets. The final CD is seen as somewhat of a unicorn in the industry as of now. However, it is gaining levels of normalization at select firms.
So what are all three tenets?
We will walk through each step and their implementations with specific open-source tools and their respective use-cases.

                    <span>Factory Method(virtual constructor) provides an interface for creating objects in a super-class, but defers instantiation to sub-classes.
Consider an application which has to access a class, but does not know which class to choose form among a set of sub-classes of the parent class. The application class can’t predict the sub-class to instantiate as the choice might depend on numerous factors, such as the state of the application at run-time or its configuration.
The Factory method pattern solves this problem by encapsulating the functionality of selecting and instantiating the appropriate class inside a designated method, which we refer to as the factory method.
The factory method pattern can be used in cases where:
A class can not know or predict the object it must create

                    <span>Lately, we started a project to improve the performance of our main app. We identified a few API calls we were calling a lot. Results of these calls can change but not very very often so it&#x27;s not an issue to cache the result for a minute or so.
So I implemented a very easy cache that will reuse active promises and returns already resolved results for a minute after an initial resolution.
This article will go over the code in detail.
function getData(key){
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    console.log(&#x27;starting get &#x27; + key)

    setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {
        console.log(&#x27;ending get &#x27; + key)
        resolve(key);
    }, 1000);
  })
}

Easy enough.
Now we need a few variables where we store our promises, results, and resolution times. We will also create a new function that …</span>

Say whatever you will about the world of app creation, but there is no denying that it is exceptionally vast and contains practically endless possibilities within itself. 
What is important here is the fact that the vastness of possibilities the world of app creation provides is what allows you to enter it seamlessly. And, even more than that, it allows you to create great life-improving applications and significantly improve your finances as well.

                    <span>It’s been a year since I graduated from my Bootcamp and about 8 months of working at CodeCast. While I’m still a junior developer through and through, I’ve started to get more comfortable with where I am at. Looking back I can see a lot of things I wish I had done differently, which is great, to be honest. Being able to recognize that I’ve changed and grown as a developer is fantastic. 
I previously wrote a post about some of the common mistakes that junior developers make. Since then, I’ve come up with a new list of mistakes I see myself and others making, so I thought it was the perfect time to write a second part. Without further ado, let’s get into it!

In this article, we will discuss how you can create the release note tools using ReactJS.
Step 1: Installing React

Step 2: Installing Tailwind
In this project, we&#x27;ll be using Tailwind - CSS framework, that&#x27;ll help us in rapidly building the interface for release notes.
Next, by using npm, we install all the tailwind dependencies and set up its configuration file. 
All you have to do is follow the simple instructions at tailwind CSS documentation.

These sorts of divisive claims bring about nothing but toxicity to our community, and only alienate the junior developers who are new to it. Especially for the profit of some traffic on Twitter or elsewhere, it&#x27;s despicable.
They paint a completely wrong image of the web dev scene, too - being a web developer is much more about the perpetual process of self-improving, learning new tools &amp; technologies and experimenting with methods to combine them in the best way, rather than knowing some constant list of terms (which are often occasionally useful at best).

                    <span>最新的MN3增加了画笔的上限。可以使用七支笔。
偶然想到，可不可以用来画画呢？
就试了一下。
结论是，橡皮几乎不能用。因为是不分图层擦除。
所以，还是打好草稿，确定不太走形，然后一点点把线条堆上去。
另外，无意间试了性能的上限——线条复杂到这种程度，就有点卡。

                    <span>冲动购买 Flip3 之后，我遇到一个大问题。
我之前的两台手机都有双 SIM 卡支持，以至于我完全忘记了「实体双 SIM 卡也是一个特性」这件事。到手前一小时我才发现，这块小家伙不光没有大电池，还没有第二张 SIM 卡的容身所。本着不要多花钱的原则，我试着用了几天闲置的 iPhone 6s，可它实在服役太久，换过的电池和屏幕相继出问题。实在忍受不了点击不到的边角按钮和用到 40% 就突然消失的电量的我，做了一个现在看起来非常差劲，甚至有点离谱的决定：
我买了 2018 年上市的黑莓 KEY2，满足自己对实体全键盘最后的执念。

实体全键盘，遗失的美好
其实购买的时候，我就没对它抱有多大期望。因为即使成色再新，它也是一部 2018 年发布的手机了。我当然还有其他选择，比如发布时间更近的 Unihertz Titan 与 Pocket，可它们一来配置没有优秀多少，二来那块正方形的屏幕据说会带来不少兼容性问题。综合考虑下，现在市面上的全键盘手机，最适合我的就只剩下 KEY2。想来稍微有点悲哀。
有朋友说 TCL 代工的黑莓已经不再是原汁原味的黑莓了，但 KEY2 的外形与手感仍然带着我熟悉的味道。骁龙 660 处理器，和我因为卡顿淘汰的坚果 Pro 2 一样。我这么说可能有些奇怪，但这两部手机都像是对千篇一律的圆角直板全触屏提出的抗议，当然下场也一样，它们都停留在时代进步的扬尘里。相比之下，坚果可能还显得更先进一些，KEY2 基本就是电子设备的活化石。

我到现在还是认为，对于大部分一般消费者来说，黑莓的意义就是那些黑莓一样的小小按键。这也是到手之后我急着确认的第一件事。作为持有 9790 的前黑莓用户，我并不觉得 KEY2 的键盘手感有什么明显的差距，除了那一颗空格。不知道是不是因为集成了指纹识别器，它的晃动十分明显，打字时都能明显感到跷跷板。至于其他小键，在我看来和 979…</span>

🏆 Users’ Choice 2021 榜单出炉

到了十二月，今年的 Play Store 的应用评选榜单 Users’ Choice 2021 也照例发布。
按照惯例，今年的 Users’ Choice 评选出的 App 虽然对于大部分国内 Android 玩家讲未必全是熟悉的应用/游戏，而且不同地区之间的奖项也略有区别，但作为 Android 最大应用分发平台 Play Store 每年推出的评选，这份榜单往往具有很强的「时效性」，能反映出过去一年 Android 应用生态以及全球社会的各种变迁，因此仍有很多看点。
值得特别注意的一个改变是：今年应用榜单针对 Google TV、Android 平板以及 WearOS 手表等泛 Android 平台应用，为其加入了专属的评选奖项，让这些原本一直属于相对「边缘化」的应用需求也终于走上台前，得以被更多用户所知。这也与 Google 近两年一直在推动的改变不谋而合。
游戏部分，《宝可梦大集结》（Pokémon UNITE）与《英雄联盟手游）（League of Legends: Wild Rift）这两款国内玩家也不会很陌生的现象级游戏也很自然地榜上有名。

后续我们也会推出关于此次应用评选结果的专题文章，敬请期待。

                    <span>少数派会员今年 6 月 1 日正式上线，到现在已经整整半年了。对于这个新生的板块，我们一方面满怀信心和诚意，同时也深知经验有限，无法一开始就尽善尽美。因此，会员上线以来，我们始终没有停止过搜集反馈、回顾反思；会员计划的内容和形式也经历了诸多微调。在此特别感谢已经购买会员并给我们提出了宝贵建议的朋友们。
站在这个半年的节点上，我想亲自跟新老会员聊聊会员计划的成长历程，谈谈我们目前为止的发现和思考，希望大家耐心看完。

从梦想到实践，少数派付费内容的早期尝试
尽管「内容免费分享」的理念似乎已经根植于互联网文化之中，但这种模式是以早期小规模、精英化的互联网生态为前提的。在用户多元化、信息爆炸以至冗余的当下，「既要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草」是难以保证持久、优质的输出的。尽管内容从业者通过各种方式绕过付费这道坎，希望通过推广和带货来为内容生产输血，但实践表明这种模式并不容易形成稳定循环，潜在利益冲突也容易侵蚀媒体的信任根基。
基于这样的思考，我们很早就开始尝试探索健康、公允的内容付费模式。早在 2017 年、少数派的商业前景尚不明朗之际，我们仍然坚持投入大量心血，推出了第一套付费教程——《用更现代的方式做任务管理：Todoist 完全使用指南》。
当时，少数派不仅没有专门的付费栏目模块，连支付系统也尚未建立。然而，凭借教程本身的质量和忠实用户的信任，我们依靠一篇介绍文章、一个收款表单，也获得了五万元的销售收入。
五万元不算多，去掉给作者的分成，留给网站的收益更少。但这次尝试为我们验证了教程内容的价值，给了我们信心在内容付费这条路上走下去——哪怕再小众的领域，都有付费内容存在的空间；这本来就是少数派应该做的事。
第一次成功的试水后，我们在之后的一年中陆续推出了 设计课、信息管理 等付费栏目，受到了不少好评。但与此同时…</span>

                    <span>前言
如果没有亲自尝试过下面这款 App，你可能会对这个画面感到迷惑。它既不简单，又不复杂；你不知道它究竟能做什么，但它看起来又不是完全无法预测，毫无规律。

这个 App 的全名是 Uzu, An Interactive Light Show。简单来说，它充分地利用了 multi-touch 多点触摸屏的特性：根据触点的个数及其移动轨迹来给予用户不同的反馈，让屏幕上的发光粒子跟着你的手指上演一场流光溢彩的灯光秀。
如今，multi-touch 对于大多数人来说早已不是什么神奇的技术，但在 iPhone 和 iPad 刚刚诞生的那几年里，它却如同魔法。当 Jobs 在舞台上首次展示如何在 iPhone 上利用手指「推动」一个菜单列表，从而实现页面滚动时，观众的惊叹就说明了一切。
自诞生以来，iPhone 就被认为是当之无愧的「智能」手机，即 smart phone。而 smart 这个词，除了「智能」以外，更有一层「耳聪目明」的意思。从 multi-touch 屏幕，到加速度感应器，再到后来的罗盘仪、原深感摄像头系统，历代 iOS 设备无不体现着这样对外界变化的灵敏反应。而宽大多彩的屏幕，又从输出的方面丰富了人们对「手机这个物件能做什么」的期待。
这些神奇的技术当然吸引了众多的 App 开发者。不同于今天强调专业性或「生产力」的市场，在早期的 App Store 中，大量的 App 都是「炫酷为主，功能为辅」，处处强调着这些新设备为 App 开发给予的极大灵活性，从而也吸引了一批又一批的新用户购入了他们的第一台智能设备，其中也包括我。
直至今日，当我们回顾这些功能简单，但制作精良的 App 时，我们仍然会被它们的「浪漫」所打动。它们体量不大，但总能做好自己的一件事，在如今看来就更是难能可贵。幸运的是，它们中的一些直到今天都还能在 iOS 15 上运行，让大家有机会随着我的这…</span>

近两年，由于疫情和经济形势，让很多人把更多时间消费待在家中。有个副业打底，成了不少人的想法。不过想是想，做是做，真正能搞的副业有哪些呢？这次老锅来带你看看录制有声书这个行当，门槛不算很高，但变现也没有知乎上面各种看似回答实则软文说的那么简单。凡事说让你轻轻松松赚多少多少的，那指定是要拉进来后噶韭菜了。

 
成为一名优秀的声音工作者，并不是一件易事。而能够变现，其实更是难上加难。要想达到专业程度的有声书录制，还是建议至少要准备电容麦克风+独立声卡+配置尚可的主机。笔记本由于散热问题可能会突然起飞，所以不是很推荐，必须要用的话也建议放得远点并且和麦克风隔开。大机箱风道相对较好，日常使用自然不会有太大的噪音，如何选择还是建议看个人情况。

大部分的专业声卡都是为音乐工作者所设计的，比如说像乐器输入接口就完全用不到。而且稍微可用的价格都小几千，初期整体投入没个大几千下不来，不是一般人能承受的。

正好哥们最近就开始录书了，这半年也是把家里的儿童房改造了下，虽然是匆匆忙忙上场但是现在也够用了。来让我们看看这个录书工作角到底是如何配置的吧，如果有入行的兴趣建议收藏下避避雷。

                    <span>下班回家再看，不过作为“JOJO小鬼”，我觉得第六部的替身都非常值得一说，我是说这些替身名字的来源。一个一个来。
Stone Free
从第四部荒木老贼开始使用欧美音乐（专辑or单曲）作为替身来源开始，其主角的替身往往都有着非同一般的意义。第四部的“Crazy Diamond”是来自Pink Floyd的专辑《Wish You Were Here》的《Shine On You Crazy Diamond》，这个歌曲贯穿整张专辑，长达26分钟的大长篇；而第五部的“Gold Experience”这是来自老贼最喜欢的歌手之一Prince的专辑《The Gold Experience》。也就是说，主角的替身选用，老贼是有很大的私心的，基本都是他极为欣赏的。
而到了第六部，也是延续了这个思路。老贼给空条徐伦的替身《Stone Free》正是吉他之神Jimi Hendrix在The Jimi Hendrix Experience乐队时期所创作的《Stone Free》，所在专辑为《Are You Experienced?》。

课后提问，第五部也有一个用Jimi歌曲当替身的人，请问这个替身使者是谁。
Goo Goo Dolls
替身名字源自同名美国另类摇滚乐队Goo Goo Dolls，也可能来自乐队首专《Goo Goo Dolls》。这支乐队在国内知名度并不算太高，其实在国外首专和二专名声也不是很响，直到那首歌的出现直接让Goo Goo Dolls一炮而红，即《Iris》，还是因为尼古拉斯·凯奇主演的《天使之城》。

Manhattan Transfer
荒木老贼涉猎广泛的代表，你以为只有摇滚乐队？上来就是一个合唱团。名字来自美国爵士合唱团The Manhattan Transfer。
所以后来《第八部》有了流行音乐的Born This Way也算是意料之中了。

                    <span>&quot;I&#x27;m so much more open to stuff now.&quot; On the verge of 100 million followers, Billie Eilish is ready to step back into the world as the most comfortable version of herself. Filled with new life experience, two more Grammys than last year, and a few less of her infamous one-liners, Billie Eilish truly is happier than ever. From hosting the Met Gala to being the reason Oscar de la Renta no longer sells fur, watch to see how much Billie has grown since her first interview in 2017 with Vanity Fair.

                    <span>Lately, I&#x27;ve been tending to lean more towards employing a monolithic approach in system architecture. On paper, using micro-services seems like an ideal solution. The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I&#x27;ve watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.
I&#x27;m not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn&#x27;t really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.
So my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?</span>

Literally, developing a game engine is not on my resume... yet! So any code or ways of doing anything you read here, is just what I&#x27;ve figured out and works for me, which by no means should suggest to you that it is the proper way to do what ever it may be. Please consult your local guru first.
OK, now that we have that established... Please consider the following as entertainment and should you lean along the way with me, that&#x27;s wonderful!
Now, by the time of writing this article, I am several months into this undertaking. I&#x27;ll describe in future posts what the engine is capable of, but for today, let me tell you about what happened over the last 2 weeks. I will likely break them up into separate posts for easier consumption.

                    <span>Video is one of the best ways for capturing audience attention. Product demonstrations, property tours, tutorials, and keynotes all make great content—provided that they’re readily searchable by your team and visitors alike. Even though tagging and categorization help organize videos and make them easy to find, the labeling process is labor intensive, taking time away from key tasks like creating new videos.
The solution? Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content. Video tagging extends image classification to image sequences, capable of detecting types of scenes (cities, mountains, the seaside) and objects (people, cars), and even inferring whether the content is appropriate for public viewing.

                    <span>Functional components in React are most beautiful because of React Hooks. With Hooks, we can change state, perform actions when components are mounted and unmounted, and much more.
While all these are beautiful, there is a little caveat (or maybe not) that is a little bit frustrating when working with useEffect hook.
Before we look at this issue let&#x27;s do a quick recap on the useEffect hook.
The useEffect hook allows you to perform actions when components mount and unmount.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // actions performed when component mounts

  return () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // actions to be performed when component unmounts
  }
}, []);

The callback function of the useEffect function is invoked depending on the second parameter of the useEffect function.
The second parameter is an array of dependencies. You…</span>

                    <span>Just wrapped up Day 2 of Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent and from the Midnight Madness concert, to building an AI-Powered Image Processor during Talia Nassi&#x27;s workshop, to catching up with the amazing Adrienne Tacke from MongoDB....there is a TON going on Vegas! 
In this episode of the Tech Stack Playbook, I&#x27;ll be sharing more about AWS re:Invent - the year&#x27;s largest global tech conference that brings together leaders, builders, innovators, and creators from cloud, DevOps, serverless, app development, and software engineering from all around the world.
Also, I built an AI-Powered image processing application that can take images and analyze certain features about the uploaded images…so that was pretty cool 😱
In this blog post and the blog posts to come this week, my hope is to vlog through the entire week and share all that I&#x27;m learning and building with you all so whether you are attending virtually or in person, this AWS re:Invent series on the Tech Stack Playbook will help you gain skills, level up in tech, and boost your software engineering abilities from the sessions I&#x27;m attending throughout the conference.
Here’s a glance at what you’ll learn in this blog post:




It&#x27;s going to be a major week for cloud and tech in general, so I am so excited to bring you along for the ride.

                    <span>Using Existing Tooling to Make Changes Reversible


This morning I deployed a major change to the production servers of DEV.to. 
Feature update: Feed - DEV Community.


Adjusting the feed is a big deal. It’s the front door of DEV.to.
We wanted to gather information about the impact of changing the front door. At Forem we use the Field Test gem. This allows us to run different experiments. I configured Field Test to assign 20% of the folks to the new strategy and 80% of the folks to the prior strategy.
To insulate from upstream libraries, we often wrap those libraries in our own implementations. This helps with the principle of least exposure; rely on the narrowest interface possible. I wrote the AbExperiment class to be the wrapper around Field Test. With the wrapper, I allowed for the sys…</span>

                    <span>话说现在密码泄露事件层出不穷，为了以后账户密码不怕被一锅端，很多人都想办法针对不同网站设置多个不同的密码 (我们专门为此撰写过一篇文章)，这样虽然更安全，但也稍微带来了记忆上的负担。
对于密码的存储与管理，我们之前介绍过 KeePass 和 LastPass，前者就是开源的本地帐号密码存储管理工具，后者提供浏览器插件，可记录下你每个网站的帐密并自动填写登录。不过由于 LastPass 所有密码数据都是保存在网上的，很多人都担心其安全性。而今天介绍的 1Password 则集多家之长，支持手机、电脑多平台同步，密码保存在本地，是目前我认为是我见过的最完美的密码管理解决方案……

                    <span>悲观主义哲学家叔本华曾说：

生命是一团欲望，不满足则痛苦，满足则无聊，人生就在痛苦和无聊之间摇摆。

不知他如果穿越到 2021 年，见识了一个被短视频包围，在微博和豆瓣鹅组左右横跳，以第一时间吃瓜的现代社会之后，还会坚持自己的观点吗？
但其实「无聊」一词，有着丰富的内涵。它不是一种无所事事的虚无，而应该是一种有意为之，为「有聊」而蓄力的状态。
说起「有聊」，又是一个被消费主义重新定义（或者说是被创造出来的）的词。何为「有聊」?难道春天去樱花树下、夏天去海边冲浪、秋天去山林里露营、冬天去雪山滑雪，就是所谓的「有聊」吗?
无聊抑或有聊，值得得好好聊聊。
第七期再读播客，我们请到《你有权保持无聊》一文的作者 @Shooca （当然也是 @重新想象Lab 专栏主理人），来一起聊聊关于「无聊」的话题。

作为一个苹果全家桶用户，Apple Music 是我欣赏音乐的不二选择。比起国内的音乐 App 那些「花里胡哨」的社交和直播功能，它干净且纯粹的听歌体验和低廉的价格获得了身边不少朋友的好评。然而，我所使用的 Apple Music 却和别人的有那么点「不一样」：尽管 Apple Music 的曲库已经在不断完善，而我也开了大陆和香港两个地区的订阅，但在我的 iPhone 和 iPad 上，「同步资料库」的按钮却一直是关闭的。
没错，在 2021 年的今天，我依旧坚定着拒绝着音乐订阅制，还在用着 20 年前的方式来听歌：购买 &gt; 下载 &gt; 同步 &gt; 欣赏。所以从某种角度上来看，iPod 这个东西的灵魂一直都存在于我的 iPhone 和 iPad 中，未曾消逝过。

而谈到「音乐订的订阅制」，往往离不开的另一个词语便是「流媒体」。要分清楚的是，我并不拒绝流媒体，因为它本质是一种技术，指的就是服务提供商可以将一系列的媒体文件打包压缩之后放到服务器上，经由互联网实时传输来让用户欣赏内容，而不需要耗费大量的时间在下载这件事情上。简单来说，一切「在线欣赏」的媒体、游戏内容，都归属于流媒体的范畴。我虽然没有开启 iCloud 资料库同步，但我却并不拒绝使用这种技术来欣赏媒体内容。
但音乐订阅制不同，它最核心的一个特点是「租赁」。也就是说，你所拥有的仅仅只是在服务商所规定的生效时段内聆听这首音乐的权利。这些音乐服务商就像你所租房的房东一样，给钱就能留下，不给钱就说再见。只不过一般而言，流媒体音乐服务商们不会因为你拖欠房租而「赶你出门」—— 因为根…</span>

                    <span>点进来的时候是不是以为，我写的肯定不是「把手机时间调早四个小时，给足心理暗示，就算十点起也是一种六点起」这种自欺欺人的方法？
……不好意思啊，还真就是调表这么简单。只不过我是反着调的，而且只调了两个小时。
所以现在每天早上八点闹钟准时把我叫醒，按照正常世界的时间流速，我真的是早上六点起来的。
你到底为什么会有这种奇怪的想法啊
最初当然是因为英国绝望的冬令时制度，十月最后的周日晚上，夏令时结束，时间往后调一小时，回到了格林尼治标准时间（Greenwich Mean Time, GMT）。
这也带来了所有住在高纬度地区人类的共同烦恼：天黑太早，特别致郁。NHS 还专门有一个网页，提供季节性抑郁（Seasonal Affective Disorder, SAD）的相关信息。
现在只是十一月中，然而每天下午四点钟的时候天就黑了，并且还在不断提前中。加上英国特有的阴雨天气，曾经一月有几次三点出门就天黑得不行。没有光明的时间里，无论实际时间如何，常给我一种「到了入睡时间」的感觉，想要做事都提不起精神来。

我刚来英国的时候十六七岁，整个人有用不完的能量，伦敦又是个远超我此前居住地的国际大都市，娱乐和学习上头的时候哪管白天黑夜，加上一个人住没人管我，通宵达旦还能神清气爽，面不改色吃光半桶炸鸡。哪懂什么熬夜胸口痛啊，脱发啊，长痘啊，留学就是好山好水好寂寞啊——「网上的人都在说什么屁话！」1
就是报应来得太快，人生哪有第二个十七岁呢……！
四点多天黑这件事在我的认知里，从「以前开膛手杰克就是在这里杀人的吧，好刺激」「在图书馆里开灯学习，好有氛围」变成了「我不会走路上被人杀了吧」「天黑了学什么习，我要睡觉」。
两年前的某一个下午，上了一天学回家的我走在路灯下，脑子里不断想着长长的 to-do-list，得出的结论是「世界和我快点有一个完蛋吧」。回到家提不起精神学习，想找朋友聊天，却因为时差的缘…</span>

笔者按：本文有视频版本，但视频文案与本文有较多区别。文章对理论的阐述更清晰，视频则宽泛且综合些。若对理论感兴趣，更推荐阅读文章。
 
一直以来，我对于「如何构筑系统」都有着深厚的兴趣，前后也写了一些自己的思考和实践。几个月前，我发表了一篇名为《打造宿舍收纳系统》的文章，尝试从桌搭入手讲述一些建立收纳系统的思路。文章收获了一些好评，不过我始终觉得有的地方还是没说到位，对方法论的描述不够具体，介绍产品太多，谁若想要借鉴，很多信息可能难以复用。
《东西我都装好了｜由极致性价比打造的宿舍收纳系统》
现在，当毕业后回顾曾经的宿舍生活，我终于逐渐参悟埋藏于产品背后的收纳逻辑。所以，这次我想再来聊一聊，到底如何构筑收纳系统。
先解构后建构
「收纳」本质上是解决「人」和「环境」之间的矛盾。任何收纳都是协调的结果，是一种谈判，是在有限空间前提下的排列组合。同时，既然解构是一切建构的前提，那么要「构筑收纳系统」，就要分别理解「人」和「环境」这两大因素。
生活中「人」的需求
早起来不及吃早饭，会觉得饿，于是学会提前一晚准备面包；存放面包需要空间，于是在桌面上随手一丢……这是很常见的做法。这也是最基本的收纳逻辑：「人」产生需求，需求需要产品来满足，而「环境」容纳产品。所以，在讨论如何使桌面井井有条之前，首先要明白自己的生活需求有哪些。
列需求，这项工作有些像产品经理。做产品的一项重要工作是为需求排序，确立优先级。我们也要做同样的事，所以别急着漫无目的地空想，还是采用些理论更成体系——试试大名鼎鼎的「马斯洛需求层次」吧。

                    <span>谢邀。
从业30年，这问题我可能能答108条？
但是最初的，总是最难忘的。那是一切的起点……那时，我还不是漫画家。
回忆001-“画王和他的姐姐”

这幅画来自遥远的1994年，创作时间是1月，还在《雪椰》之前……那年我17。
它诞生的原因，来自我在某小学旁的小书店，发现了《画书大王》的第七期。我被封面的《龙珠》瞬间秒到，很快就买下了它。原本以为这是盗版书商学习香港杂志搞出来的盗版作品合集，但当我翻开它时，竟意外地发现它上面竟刊登着真真切切的国产漫画作品！而且，它它它……居然还接受投稿！！！

彼时一直在找寻能投稿平台的我，恨不得当场就给它跪了！
我扫荡了书店里所有的过期《画王》，回家细读。然后就发现了这个：

“先把这玩意参加咯，然后就投稿！”我这么想着，一分钟也没耽搁，立刻铺开画纸开始设计。
从小就喜欢不按规则行事的我，一口气就画下了“两个画王”。然后振振有词地在设计说明里写了老大一篇：“私以为画王不应只有一人，亦应考虑女性读者需求，所以应为其设计一位姐姐，画王11岁，姐姐14，5，既让女读者也能找到共鸣点，又能照顾年龄稍大之读者的阅读感受……至于为甚给“画王”设计姐姐而不是妹妹，是因为除年纪外尚要考虑角色个性，11岁男童要可爱合适懵懂淘气，小大人乖乖仔会惹人厌恶。而出于性格互补另一角色应温柔知性，此种性格用于姐姐身上合适……且不应互换，知性哥哥和调皮妹妹不讨喜……“
光角色说明，我当年就写了2大页吧……？也不知有没吓着《画王》编辑……
我再找出自己平常的一些习作画稿，塞了至少有个6，7页进信封；（你们懂那种年少时拿着自己上百幅自认的惊世之作恨不得全给塞进去的心情不？哈哈哈……）又另写了一封3页纸阐述自己如何喜爱漫画，吹捧《画王》，并问询如何投稿的心里话……直至把信封塞爆……
换了新信封后，我用透明胶把它给封了两层边，才出街丢进邮筒，怀着对回信的憧憬，屁颠屁颠地蹦回了家。
两周后，我竟然收到了主编大人的亲笔回信！我被告知：”很可惜，你的稿件寄到时，画王设计征集活动早已截至。因此，基于公平原则，你的设计我们不能采纳。“但是：”我们觉得你的画很不错哦！你愿意尝试画个短篇故事投稿试试吗？你需要先……“
那天，我在我的小屋里，抓着回信，高举过头，发出了青春的咆哮！
不喜欢按规则行事的我，开始了《雪椰》的策划……并在回信里给主编说：“对不起……短篇我一时没有头绪，我想了个长篇您要不要看看……？”

咳咳，作为前几天实地蹲点摸排的人员之一，在去在这里涉事人出租屋去搜查违规军服和伪造文件时，我惊呆了！震惊的主要原因是：这么假，怎么能有人信？


在这里，有必要为广大战友正名，我们现役军人是不会拍这么多个人照的（宣传干事们不要打我……），更不会在网上发布带有军种符号标志和军衔的照片。其次，兄dei，你的肩章都要歪到天上去了，“穿了龙袍也不像太子”说的就是这哥们本人了，周身气质着实与军人不符啊！还有营长，是少校配置，这一毛三有点着急啊。

还穿着常服四处剪彩，这行为也属实迷醉。因为警备纠察的范围，只能对人员身份进行核查，并调查清楚军装来源与穿着目的，对违规军装进行没收，并没有执法权，所以涉事人已经被移交给“警察叔叔”立案处理了。后续有结果，小编也会第一时间告诉大家。军人，军装不容抹黑，欢迎大家加入发现“假军人”的打假队伍。
科普一下：根据我国《刑法》第三百七十二条【冒充军人招摇撞骗罪】规定：冒充军人招摇撞骗的，处三年以下有期徒刑、拘役、管制或者剥夺政治权利；情节严重的，处三年以上十年以下有期徒刑。日子挺有判头……

由于比邻的地缘格局和相近的文化传统，东亚各国在饮食习惯上有着很多共性。比如用筷子、喝粮食酒、蘸酱油调味、吃辣椒酱、吃腌渍蔬菜、吃白米饭、吃狗肉……几乎所有被中国人打上了鲜明标签的本民族餐桌元素，都能在朝鲜、韩国、日本、越南找到共鸣。腐乳，也许是唯一的例外。






这种由豆腐腌制发酵而来的小菜，廉价、鲜美、用途广泛。同时，它还完美解决了豆制品不耐存储运输的问题，是中国各地最常见的小菜之一。但神奇的是，同样对豆腐怀有热爱的朝鲜、韩国、日本和越南，却几乎见不到腐乳的影子。不吃腐乳，他们各有理由，诸如“有异味”“高盐”“不健康”，但似乎全然忘记了异味更大的日本纳豆，与含盐量同样高的韩国泡菜。历史上与中国有着千丝万缕联系的冲绳群岛，至今倒是依然流行着一种名为“豆腐糕“的食物。和腐乳一样，它依赖发酵改良豆腐的口感。



因为豆腐糕不能太咸，所以其制作过程只能依靠酒精来控制霉菌的滋生。在加入冲绳本地烈酒“泡盛“后，大量有益菌群被杀死，这就导致豆腐糕的发酵程度不够深，空有腐乳的质感，缺乏氨基酸为腐乳带来的，爆炸般的鲜味。本质上，冲绳豆腐糕只是一种类似腐乳的点心，它远远达不到腐乳的味觉高度。究竟是怎样的土壤，成就了酵变于腐乳之中的中餐滋味、隐藏于腐乳之外的华夏风韵、搭建于腐乳之上的汉唐美学？

制造腐乳的的原材料是豆腐，并且豆腐的含水量不能太高，需要达到一定的固形物密度。日本人发明的“绢豆腐”，是无法制造腐乳的。盐卤，是制作腐乳的先决要素。



虽然这种由氯化钾、氯化镁和溴化镁等杂质构成的制盐废料，具有一定的化学毒性，经常被当成健康饮食的反面教材。但没有朴素的盐卤参与，就无法“点”出干湿适度、软硬合宜的豆腐。纵观众多历史久远的腐乳产地，诸如浙江绍兴、广西桂林、山东临清、云南楚雄、福建莆田……它们有一个共同特点…</span>

《红楼梦》里，有一段耐人寻味的场景。香菱与一群小丫鬟玩，不慎弄脏了身上的“石榴红绫”裙子，小丫头们吓得一哄而散。“妇女之友”贾宝玉留了下来，拿了袭人的同款裙子给香菱。“（香菱）接了裙子，展开一看，果然同自己的一样。又命宝玉背过脸去，自己叉手向内解下来，将这条系上。香菱拉他的手，笑道：‘这又叫做什么？怪道人人说你惯会鬼鬼祟祟使人肉麻的事。’”成年人读到这里，总会露出一脸姨母笑。袭人什么身份？和贾宝玉试过“云雨情”的通房丫头。贾宝玉拿了袭人的裙子给香菱，香菱不但不避嫌，还当着男人的面换裙子。换完了，俩人还手拉手笑嘻嘻说话，嗔怪对方“肉麻”。曹雪芹同志就差把“性暗示”三个字写在纸上了。



石榴裙，是这则故事里的关键道具。事实上，在汉语言文字里，“石榴裙”三字在大多数语境下，都带着浓郁的桃色气息。它暗藏了中国人对性事只可意会不可言传的微妙观念，以及对石榴这种水果既充满向往、又随意亵玩的矛盾态度。作为一个外来物种，石榴也许不是在中国混得最好的水果，但它一定是最能融入汉文化的水果。

根据西晋张华《博物志》记载，石榴是张骞出使西域时，从石国带回来的植物。所谓“石国”，有可能是地处南疆至中亚的古国。今天，当地许多地名里，如喀什（kashgar）、克什米尔（kashmir）、塔什干（tashkent），依然常见许多带有“石”（sh）的音节。虽然石榴是不是张骞带回的植物已经不可考，但它源自西域却是肯定的。公元前十世纪，所罗门王就在肥沃的新月地带，栽种了石榴，并且爱饮用石榴汁榨的香酒。《雅歌》甚至用石榴来形容所罗门王喜爱的姑娘：“你的两颊裹在帕子内，如同一块石榴”。

                    <span>傲慢与偏见——谈谈2021年的轻厉和轻小说
既然去年头脑一热写了那个轻厉总结帖，那今年也延续一下习惯写点字，我的能力和眼界也不足以去谈轻小说的趋势、格局这种大东西，更没资格去评价排名是否公正，那就讲讲今年轻厉前10我读过的书，还有进了前100的我觉得还行的和没有进轻厉但我私心偏爱的书吧。毕竟今年前100姑且看过48本，但感觉很多非新作或者新作里觉得只是平平无奇没特别深印象甚至“我为啥花钱买这本”的就不列了，多数书其实只是原先写的感想抄过来改改，部分觉得有必要的可能会写点感想以外的东西。反正想到哪写到哪，聊的也是和标题一样充满了纯主观的傲慢与偏见的内容，大家就当图一乐好了，如果能真的顺着这篇文章发现可能自己会喜欢的书那就太好了。
关于轻厉和协力者本身的介绍和看法在去年帖子就已经说了，所以这里就讲下今年的变化，一是协力者从去年81人扩容到96人（但去年的协力者有不少今年没续投，毕竟30+的社畜还得肝GBF打原神哪有那么多时间读书，所以通过重新招募补充了30-40人左右的新规），而且协力者的选定标准也第一次披露（年间60册或者日常在当轻小说博主管人就有资格评选），反正协力者本身也只是按照自己的喜好投票的读者，投票结果一如既往会公布，直接买本看看大家投啥就行了。二是web票必须投满5部作品，否则视为无效，造成了有效票从去年的10000票下降到了今年的6000票，不过去年本身就有约1/3票是只投了1部作品的，所以相比去年参与者也不算下降，但必须投5票的确可能导致实际上没读那么多就投点凑数的热门书就是了。废话说完，下面开始按照不分文库单行本的总排名随便写写自己看过的那些书了，如果协力者和WEB进前30了会标注下，我自己投了哪些也会标注（排名微博上有）：

飞机是怎么完成复杂的飞行动作的呢？其实这些高超的飞行表演，都和飞机的超机动性有着密切的关系。那什么是飞机的超机动性呢？
简单来说，我们生活当中开车是在二维空间里进行，而飞机是在三维空间里运动。为了进一步弄清楚超机动性，我们要先了解什么是传统的机动飞行。传统机动飞行主要是指以空气动力为升力所形成的过载完成的曲线运动。而超机动性是在空气动力较弱的区间完成的过失速机动动作。
超机动飞行可在三维空间内完成任意角度、方向的机动飞行。这就要求超机动飞行必须在能量足够的情况下才能完成。普通航空发动机提供的推力方向是固定的，而矢量推力发动机可将推力方向做垂直或水平调整，采用矢量推力用于直接推力，完成飞机的各种复杂机动动作，才能实现超机动飞行。详情点击：

在中国960万平方公里的土地上，口味差异、食材差异、烹饪技术差异，呈现出鲜明的地理适性。所谓“中餐”，很少拥有滋味和外观上的共性，更多时候代表的是基于国家认同下的广泛饮食聚落。但葱油也许是个例外：葱属植物和油脂，这两种滋味、形态、质素有巨大差异的食材，只要到了中国人手中，便成为天作之合：无论是下里巴人的葱油饼、葱油酥、葱油拌面，还是文雅内秀的葱油鸡、葱油肉，又或者是入室登堂的葱油海参、葱油鲥鱼，在加持一勺爆香的葱油之后，都成了地道的中国味儿。孤帆远影碧空尽，举国上下爱葱油。

从植物学的分类看，葱与韭菜、大蒜、薤（藠头）都是同一科的近亲。它们天然富含被称为蒜素或葱素的刺激性成分。实质上，无论蒜素还是葱素，都是由丙烯硫醚、丙烯二硫、硫醇等成分，以不同比例构成的硫化合物。嗅觉敏感的人，常常对啃过葱、嚼过蒜的人避之不及，形容对方“嘴里有屎味”。某种程度上说，这也没错，排泄物的气味里，硫化物也做出了相当贡献。出家人不能吃“五荤“，本质上是认为这些刺鼻的气味影响人的清修。



但奇妙的是，惹人嫌恶的葱素、蒜素，在受热并接触油脂后，会发生脱胎换骨的蜕变。脂肪与硫化物快速分解、结合，成为新的风味物质，脂香四溢、葱味缭绕，这是大多数人都难以拒绝的诱惑。口有同嗜，这种高度契合的食材组合，其实在全球范围内广泛存在。日本人以切碎的大葱搭配味噌汤，依靠大豆和鱼肉…</span>

                    <span>『车田漫画里需要的不是起承转合，如何让读者感到惊讶才是最重要的』
———by 车田正美



这是整个车田宇宙的核心，也是圣斗士成为经典的核心。


也许当年就真吃这套，天马行空的设定比故事本身更受关注。车田这么做了，也确确实实的做到了，打造了一个跨世纪的经典。


车田以他自己那套独创的模式开拓了一片新天地。「开头→叙述→转折→结尾」这种死板的形式，在车田宇宙里可不太常见。


各种荒诞无稽的设定，夸张的必杀，独特的战斗表现集合成所谓的『车田節』。凭借这些独特之处，堆砌了圣斗士世界。



▽
当然，光有核没有精美外壳想必也无法做到风靡世界。其中，星座的实体化无疑是圣斗士成为经典的最重要因素。


在生活中，星座早已成为如同十二生肖般的必然存在。当时，多少朋友通过圣斗士把十二星座倒背如流。


星座通过防具【圣衣】得到实体化。再配上美型男与其搭配，这是男女通杀的妙招，无一幸免。


圣衣的定位本身也是一个亮点，它增大了星座实体化的魅力！



『最初打算用日本武士铠甲型防具，战斗模式就像空手道对决那样。威力过于强大，所以需要穿戴防具。


但感觉普通的防具太土。烦恼之际，脑中突然浮现出希腊神话，觉得把防具做成星座的形状那绝对很酷。


防具定位于西洋风那种带曲线的设计。现在看来狮子座艾欧里亚的黄金圣衣，应该是最接近当初所构思的印象吧』



圣衣效仿西洋风甲胄，但未照搬样式。反倒是削弱了笨重感，进行了更贴身的改良，就像穿戴的服装一样。


动画版中的圣衣设计，更是改良得凸显了美型男的完美身体曲线。这样的视觉冲击，也是促进人气暴涨的重要因素吧。
其中，荒木伸吾与姫野美智的功劳甚大


圣衣根据等级还体现着不同的风格。而这种等级差异，车田直接用对身体的覆盖率，进行了体现。



『当初对圣斗士有个大概的年龄设定。青铜为初中，白银为高中，黄金为大学。对应身高约在165，175，180左右。


另外，圣衣的等级如同军队里的官阶。青铜为尉级，白银为校级，黄金则是将级。


一般印象中，低等兵大都穿戴像作业服那种比较短款的服装，长官级是夹克之类的，而将领级则是长款大衣那种吧。


如此，仅凭穿着就可能判断出级别。当时就是这样考虑的』


圣斗士中青铜最低级，看着也最凉快。白银稍微严实点，黄金则露出更少，神圣衣基本就约等于全身覆盖了。



虽然是防具，但圣衣更像是一种时尚。圣衣的命名『cloth』也算是回应了此特征。


似衣非衣，即使不穿戴圣衣，它依靠着星座本来的造型依然能独立炫酷的存在。这样的设计超级有魅力，即便现在也依旧拉风。


▽
如此独特的设定，没有足够大的空间，想必也难以展现出它全部的魅力。


圣斗士宏大的世界观，就为圣衣提供了一个完现魅力的『时尚平台』。圣衣在无形中仿佛拉近了传说与现实的距离。



车田用一个『超』字把众多神话串联起，所有神话被归纳成同宗。各家神话在圣斗士世界里就相当于从宗家衍生出的支派。


但在未普及互联网，信息较闭塞的当时也很难能了解到这部分内容。


而圣斗士的历史背景，其尺度远比当时所理解的要大得多得多，被称之为『大圣战史』。


》宇宙的诞生
》生命的诞生
》雅典娜的诞生
》波塞冬的初次圣战，圣斗士与圣衣诞生
》巨人族之战
》阿瑞斯的圣战
》and so on………


在正篇开始之前，还有这么一大段迷一般的历史存在。这一切在作品中基本都未提及，而是记载于此刊物中。



当了解到这一大段历史后，有种圣斗士的尺度又被放大了一倍的感觉。就是在这样一个大世界里，光芒万丈的圣衣照亮着每个角落。
《圣斗士星矢》中的众神体系是怎么样的？

▽
比起圣斗士的世界观，它的故事则显得要简单得多。但依靠这来自独特灵感的设计，依旧让此作如凤凰烈火般火红。


因为车田一直致力于让观众感受到震撼！


他破天荒的才能，对当时的观众来说也许是恰到好处。仿佛是艾欧洛斯附身，用暗影之箭束缚了世界各地观众的心。


时代在变，那份情怀却难以忘怀。那句口号依旧响彻云霄，被喊出了跨世纪的经典：


燃えろ、俺のコスモよ！

                    <span>【不要过分迎合潮流、因为焦虑改变自己。】
大学当然是用来探索、成长和改变的，但是年轻有一个弊端，就是常常回不经意走入歧途。
像我的人生是个典型的弯路合集，选错了专业，多花一年本科毕业。从错误的方法减肥，还好年轻没留下毛病。尝试了很多完全不适合自己的造型，幸好都在我做自媒体之前。
说到形象管理我真的想提醒各位妹妹，大学里很自由但也有很多杂音。特别是当你解锁屏幕打开大门，看到的都是大家对某种潮流趋之若鹜的时候，就要多问问自己：这么做是为了自己好，还是为了迎合大众的眼光。
但真正喜欢你的人关心的是你是不是健康舒服，不管你什么样子他总会在你的身上看到光芒，会温和的提醒你的错误、陪伴着你成长。只有喜欢面子的人才会不管不顾得要自己的女朋友24小时光鲜亮丽。

上到大学，在纠结要不要选班委，所以要不要选呢？
大学晚归被通报批评，没脸见人了怎么办。？</span>

                    <span>答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。
首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。
再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。
其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。
比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。

例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。
举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……
说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。

普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。
当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   
那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？

答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

请问，哪个品牌的汽车，方向盘助力做的较好，能不能比较一下？（方向盘比较轻柔，不用费太大力气。）？
为什么大部分汽车的方向盘不在中间？</span>

                    <span>Next.js is a React framework that provides a lot of useful features out of the box. One of these powerful features is API routes, which allows you to make an API/backend entirely within your Next.js application.
// pages/api/hello.js
//   requests to /api/hello return {&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Hello, World!&quot;}
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: &#x27;Hello, World&#x27; })
}

Services like Vercel and Netlify manage your API routes in a serverless environment, meaning you get a very scalable API and your code can be deployed globally. 
In this post, we&#x27;ll create an authenticated API route that looks like this:
// pages/api/whoami.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // check if the request contains a valid token
    await requireUser(req, res)

                    <span>I often find myself in the need of a very basic open/close transition in React for components like dialogs, side sheets, or dropdowns. The goto solution for a while seemed to be React Transition Group, which I never understood how to use properly. An excellent solution for animations is react-spring, but I&#x27;d consider it an overkill for a basic CSS powered open/close transition (but it&#x27;s great for animations in something like an image viewer).
This is why I’ve ended up writing my own hook: react-css-transition-hook
It is used like this:
const { isOpen } &#x3D; useMenu();
const [isVisible, props] &#x3D; useTransition(isOpen, {
  entering: &quot;transition ease-out duration-100 transform opacity-0 scale-95&quot;,

                    <span>TLDR


Accuracy tells you how many times the ML model was correct overall. Precision is how good the model is at predicting a specific category. Recall tells you how many times the model was able to detect a specific category.
Introduction
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
How to determine if your model is doing well
When to use precision or recall
Conclusion
Most machine learning (ML) problems fit into 2 groups: classification and regression. The main metrics used to assess performance of classification models are accuracy, precision, and recall.

To demonstrate each of these metrics, we’ll use the following example: We’re a mage on a quest to save the villagers from a horde of monsters. There are 100 monsters attacking the village. We’re going to use machine learning to pr…</span>

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss some patterns for organizing a global state in a React application.
Writing about how to organize global state implies that there is such a thing as disorganized state. Truth be told, there are several issues that can spring up from an unorganized, unprincipled global state.
As a basic example, the global state may contain a response payload from an API request, and it may contain some UI state about whether certain components are visible. These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.
When these distinctions aren&#x27;t made, you can run into trouble. For example, if you create a top-level property for every screen/experience, you can duplicate the storage of the API responses that support those experiences:

                    <span>Google Analytics can provide a lot of insight into traffic and about users visiting your website. A lot of this data is available in nice format in web console, but what if you wanted to build your own diagrams and visualizations, process the data further or just generally work with it programmatically? That&#x27;s where Google Analytics API can help you, and in this article we will look at how you can use it to query and process realtime analytics data with Python.
Before jumping into using some specific Google API, it might be a good idea to first play around with some of them. Using Google&#x27;s API explorer, you can find out which API will be most useful for you, and it will also help you determine which API to enable in Google Cloud console.

PostgreSQL v14 was recently released with some major improvements. Some of these improvements include enhancements for heavy workload performance, improved support for distributed workload, and security enhancements.
One of the most exciting releases is enhanced support for JSON, which will be the focus of this blog post.
Before we delve into these improvements, let’s get a good understanding of how JSON has been used in PostgreSQL. This will help us to appreciate the improvements better.
JSON was first introduced in Postgres with its v9.2 release. While it was a very exciting development, its implementation was not perfect. Postgres basically validated that the JSON to be stored is valid JSON and stored it as a text string.

This workflow builds a Java project, runs all JUnit tests, runs JaCoCo to generate a test coverage report, uses the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action to generate instructions coverage and branches coverage badges from the JaCoCo coverage report, uploads the JaCoCo report as a workflow artifact, and if the workflow run is associated with a PR it then comments on the PR with the computed coverage percentages.
The coverage badges are generated with the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator, which I have been developing and maintaining for a while now. Initially, it was strictly a badge generator, but its functionality has expanded over time to include optional support for PR checks that can be used to fail workflow runs if coverage is below a target threshold or if cover…</span>

                    <span>DynamoDB (DDB) is a compelling datastore choice for Serverless developers for a few key reasons. Dynamo offers a HTTP API, IAM Authorization, serverless pay-per-use billing, and almost unlimited scale when used properly. But there&#x27;s more to DynamoDB than a convenient way to store and fetch data for Lambda users.
If you&#x27;re new to DynamoDB and Serverless, you may not yet have come across DynamoDB Streams yet. Perhaps you have, but are a bit unclear on how to apply them to your applications. Like the OP of this twitter thread, the compelling use cases for DynamoDB Streams may not be clear to you.

                    <span>During my time as a developer I&#x27;ve created a lot of &quot;typed&quot; code. One particular issue has come up repeatedly and I finally had a moment of clarity.
Whenever I write something like this ...
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType; // ERROR HERE
  [key: string]: string;
}

... I get the following error on the commented line above.
Property &#x27;config&#x27; of type &#x27;ConfigType&#x27; is not assignable to &#x27;string&#x27; index type &#x27;string&#x27;.
The issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.
I&#x27;ve seen something like the following ...
export interface Person {
  id: number;
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
  [key: string]: string | number;
}

... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.
I came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.
This approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export type DataModel &#x3D; {
  config: ConfigType;
} &amp; {
  [key: string]: string;
};

The following code is another resolution.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType;
  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;
}

This approach has the &quot;issue&quot; that a new &quot;key&quot; could be used with another ConfigType.
As I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.
If anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.</span>

Wallpaper Engine：万众期待的动态壁纸引擎上线 Android 版

平台：Android / Windows
关键词：壁纸、动态壁纸

@Noah_Choi：想必各位玩家的 Steam 库中一定会有 Wallpaper Engine 这个强大的动态壁纸工具，它帮无数玩家美化了自己的电脑桌面、营造了一个或炫酷或可爱的娱乐氛围。不过话说回来，动态壁纸可是 Android 平台的强项，所以在近日，Wallpaper Engine 发布了 Android 版本，我们手里的手机或者平板电脑也能享受到创意工坊里无穷无尽的动态壁纸了。
使用 Wallpaper Engine 的 Android 版非常简单，它直接使用了 Android 系统动态壁纸接口，我们可以在壁纸设置中找到 Wallpaper Engine 服务，或者通过应用内设置壁纸。Wallpaper Engine 已经内置了 9 款基础壁纸，可以看作是一个基础功能展示。每种壁纸都会有一些自定义选项，例如修改配色、元素选择等等，在电脑上使用过 Wallpaper Engi…</span>

编注：如无特殊说明，以下日历产品可以直接在电商平台搜索和购买。
同福客栈日历 2022
几乎每隔一段时间，我都能听到不同的朋友说又开始重刷《武林外传》了。作为国民下饭神剧，《武林外传》的周边产业也是风生水起、热热闹闹。从原声播客到搞笑博主，应有尽有。同福客栈 2022 日历就是由 @同福客栈知识竞答 推出的。

《同福客栈2022日历》在每一天都精选了一句剧中台词，光看这文字就有画面了，难怪自称「有声日历」。所选取的句子都与当天的日期有所关联，至于到底是什么样的联系，我看必须得是《武林外传》五级学者才能真正发掘出其中的奥妙。

除了台词之外，每页日历底下还有一道知识考验。出题点都是来自剧中不起眼的一点剧情，比如「西铺米街被盗几捆大葱？」，等等…… 我竟然都不知道有西铺米街的存在？！

《同福客栈2022日历》日历页包含阴历阳历、以及星期和节假日，可以说是非常齐全了。全彩插图避开了剧中的人物与场景，不过配色鲜艳丰富，也是来自同福客栈里的各种颜色。

你可以在店铺 同福客栈知识竞答 购买《同福客栈2022日历》售价 98 元。
五金行日历 2022
中断一年后，品牌设计公司 Five Metal Shop 总算是推出《五金行日历 2022》了。

《五金行日历 2022》沿用了一如即往的高级设计。这本日历最与众不同的便是采用了大量鲜艳的配色，来自 10 种全新Pantone 颜色，包含五种霓虹色、两种金属色、两种特殊色和一种粉彩色。

它们有夜市闪烁的霓虹紫、盥洗台上的牙膏粉绿、年节餐桌上的乌鱼子红、每天追着跑的垃圾车黄。受到这些来…</span>

                    <span>前言
不知道你有没有设想过，躺在沙发上就能让卧室的电脑帮你下载想看的电影、说一句话就能让电脑打开想玩的游戏……这些看似「科幻」的操作，在智能家庭逐渐普及的当下，显然已经不是什么难事了。
不过，依赖第三方解决方案往往很难满足自身的所有需求。以我自己为例，我的 PC 作为家用游戏机，一直连接在电视上。想舒服的进行遥控，要么使用无线键鼠，要么使用远程桌面，终归费时费力。无意瞄到桌面摆放的 HomePod，开始思考能不能使用语音去进行遥控。呀，用语音进行控制 Windows 电脑，好像是个很酷的事情耶～
想到就做，但想法是美好的，事实是残酷的。就这样一个简单的需求，局限于设备平台以及系统权限，需要付出大量心血才能实现。愿意折腾的玩家或许会享受这个过程，但作为普通人的我们，就想简单快速的满足自己，那有没有好方案呢？
有的，而且很简单。下面请允许我将这个「魔法」剖析给你，助你成为家里的魔术师🪄

                    <span>Matrix 首页推荐
Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

过去的我并不认为一个足够安静的写作环境能为自己带来效率的提升——这个想法一直持续到我开始在少数派写作，然后就没有然后了。在少数派发文两个月，我逐渐意识到在写作过程中排除干扰对于保持思考的重要性。所谓「灵感」只不过是个一闪而过的念头，而抓住这个念头的难度并不比在热门视频中精准定位到一条弹幕要更容易一点——视频可以回退和暂停到进度条的任何位置，但人的想法却没有「精确回溯」这一说。既然主观上无法作为，想要更加容易的捕捉灵感，就得从客观条件的方向着手改善：在来自外界的无数干扰中，最容易被消除的当属无休止的环境噪音；而至于那些内在的杂乱想法，就只得「时时勤拂拭，勿使惹尘埃」了。
抱着如此的想法，我开始在市面上寻找一款能够满足长时专注需求的无线消噪耳机。在此之前，我曾经使用过 FreeBuds 3 及 AirPods Pro——前者在佩戴的体验上显得轻松愉快，但消噪功能的作用范围比较有限；后者的消噪效果处于该品类的第一梯队，然其悬挂入耳的设计依然会让我在使用超过三十分钟后明显感觉到耳道的「力不从心」——即使使用最小的硅胶耳塞时也不例外。当下无线消噪耳机的出货主力都是些有一定技术实力的手机厂商，这些优先适配自家硬件设备和软件生态的产品自然也会受到各种各样意想不到的限制和约束 除了 AirPods Pro 不支持 Apple Music 的无损音频，所以我将眼光投向了传统声学厂商推出的同类产品，这其中恰好有一款产品满足了我对于无线消噪耳机的全部期待——Bose QuietComfort Earbuds，通俗一点的名称则是「Bose 大鲨」。

央行解读收款二维码新规
据新华社报道，央行有关人士近日就上月发布的《中国人民银行关于加强支付受理终端及相关业务管理的通知》进行解读，针对「微信、支付宝收款码将不能用于经营收款」的说法做出澄清。该通知的主要内容之一是将条码支付纳入监管范围，对个人收款条码的使用规范做出具体规定，并将于 2022 年 3 月 1 日起施行。
根据央行说法，上述规定的背景是，此前一些商户收款使用「码牌」或者打印封装的二维码，此类「个人静态收款条码」收款安全性较低，容易被犯罪分子利用，因此要求向收款服务机构（如微信、支付宝等）申请转为商用收款码；同时，要求不得通过个人收款条码为具有明显经营活动特征的个人提供经营活动相关收款服务。
至于哪些用户属于「具有明显经营特征」，中国支付清算协会正在研究制定相关标准。人民银行有关人士表示，在相关要求实施之前，支付服务机构必须要全面、充分评估客户正常支付需求，制定配套服务解决方案，确保服务成本不升、服务质量不降。收款服务机构有义务免费为商户提供商用收款码，商户只需要提供必要的身份核实信息。来源

                    <span>汽车安全座椅在小朋友的眼中，也许是这样的：

其实在1940年前后，一小部分有车家庭就开始使用了。但如果我跟你说，当时的画风是这样的，你还敢坐嘛？

是的，那个时候它的长相和功能和现在相距甚远。严格来说还称不上是一个“安全座椅”，最多算是“汽车座椅”。

如果回到那个时代生活，我宁愿孩子们都不要坐它！因为那个时候的汽车座椅并非现在的「免死金牌」，而是一个不折不扣、骇人听闻的「儿童杀手」。
下面我就用多图来带大家看看，儿童汽车安全座椅有着怎样令人深感震撼的的百年曲折发展史。
❤️ 阶段一：座椅？打包带！
1. 啼笑皆非的早期原型
上世纪30年代能开上车的，那可真不是一般人，人们普遍认为，巨大坚硬、风雨无阻的汽车本身就是最厉害的。
当时的克莱斯勒汽车广告上俨然写着： 
 “亲爱的爸爸，你看我在100公里每小时（60迈/小时）的车上还能写字哎。” 
“是的儿子，我们现在乘坐的就是无坚不摧的钢铁大桥号。”
而且无论大人小孩，一律没有安全保护措施。

这在今天就是典型的反面教材，但那时候人们的交通安全意识基本为零。当时的汽车就算有任何安全设施，也完全不是从乘客的健全和舒适角度出发，而是为了驾驶者的方便。
比如，Bunny Bear公司在1933年发明的第一台儿童汽车座椅，只需要用绑绳捆在座位上。娃坐的高了、看得远了，注意力被转移了。大人开车也就不容易被打扰了。

到了40-60年代，家长可以花1-5刀买一个更加便携轻便的可折叠座椅。
它通常是像下面这样，用铁架子加帆布、麻布、塑料板或木箱做成的。靠两个铁钩子挂在座位靠背上，酷似一个“带钩子的内裤”。

单看乘坐的部分有点像如今的跳跳椅。不过从结构上更像一个吹风机挂篮的放大版。随意程度简直令人怀疑历史。

还有的人为了进一步增加娱乐效果，让孩子站在车座上模仿大人开车。
我们大概不需要通过撞击模拟实验也可以猜出，当意外发生时，这种挂钩座椅…</span>

                    <span>相信绝大多数职场人在平时的工作中，免不了需要参与各种规模、各种性质的会议，有团队内部的、团队之间的、跨职能、向上级汇报工作等等，如何在这些会议中能够游刃有余的有效发言，这是每一个职场人都要学的一门学问，其中很有讲究
这里对会议发言上常见的问题进行一个归类，看是否有遇到过类似经历

想说却不敢说
对 topic 不是很了解，跟不上讨论的节奏，没有办法发言，或者在场的人比较多，有一些资深的或者气场比较强的人存在，此时轮到自己发言时会语无伦次，语言能力急剧下降
敢说却不会说
发言经常被打断，等你阐述完自己的观点后，没有人对你的发言回应直接进入后面的环节或者全场雅雀没有正面或负面的反馈，试图对自己的观点补充几次后，反而自己说的重点没有了
敢说也知道怎么说，犹豫该不该讲
这种经常发生在跟上级汇报工作的场景，有的时候上司会因为缺少一些上下文，问的问题或发表的评论不一定在点子上，此时资历比较浅的人会努力的去迎合、回答解释，而不是当面指出，以此避免正面的冲突，害怕对方下不来台

要解决这些问题，首先需要明确开会的意义，以及在开会时有效发言的意义
根据会议不同的目的，可以将其分为如下 3 类：

日常例会，此类会议的主旨是在团队内同步各项目的进展，目的是找到影响工作进程的阻碍项，通过调整后续策略，以此提高团队整体执行效率
为了做某项决定而开的会，解决一些矛盾的观点，这种会议中会有不同意见直接的碰撞，目的是在会议结束时，能够让与会人都能同意某一种决定做法
征询意见的会议，集思广益来提高负责人实施方案的质量，比如在互联网公司常见的技术评审 review

会议中发言的重要性
常常听到有同学说是为了刷「存在感」，这个可能有一些片面，从侧面也反映出自身在职业发展上还没有找到突破口和契机

首先开会是一个自我学习的途径，在会议中，需要保持自己听懂或者同意会议所做的决定，这会直接影响到自己平时的工作，如…</span>

                    <span>前两天看到了网上流传的清朝的微积分课本中的几页，其中的所有数学表达式都是用中文书写的。虽然整个过程不忍直视，但还是感觉蛮有趣的。于是我打算写篇文章翻译一下这几页。[1][2]
下面我们先来看到第一页：
第一页
请您上眼。乍一看大家肯定觉得：这都啥啊？这样的公式好丑，怎么能记得住呢？而且这里面居然还有完全不认识的字？比如一个双人旁一个天念啥？
下面我就要使用魔法将这些丑丑的公式翻译成能看的懂的形式了。
在翻译之前，我们要明确的一个 大原则 是：在清朝，“分数”的“分子”是分母，“分母”是分子 。也就是说，如果看到“分数”，则我们取它的倒数就可以得到现代意义下的分数 。
提示：这条大原则全文适用 。
首先映入眼帘的是：
 
这明显是一个函数，它翻译成英语就是：
 
啊，看着舒服多啦～这道例题提到了“...求其微分之式，则可依blabla...”。害，无所谓依啥了，我们自己就可以搞定。求  这个函数的微分函数比较容易的。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
与：

做比较可以得到以下破译密码：

双人旁  
一  
长得像垂直符号的符号  
訥  

第一个公式的破译工作就完成啦～很顺利是不是！但是，下一个公式就很难破译了。没错，就是它：

这个公式，堪称我破译工作中最可(**)爱(**)的一个。先不管天啊，地啊啥的。从刚才的破译密码中我们得知的信息是 双人旁  ，于是问题就出现了这里面有  ，  以及  。咦？这么快就跳到全微分啦？但仔细不看不对啊，这跟全微分完全不沾边啊。于是我推测，这不是全微分，而是刚才例题的推广，因为我在下面的结果中看到了天的地次方：  ：

此处的天和地不能再理解为  和  了，而是应该理解为  与  ，说白了，就是对函数：
 
求导（ 这个表达简直了。。。哈哈哈哈哈哈哈）。
像破译第一个公式一样，这里我们如法炮制即可。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
将式  进一步化简可得：
 
现在我们将  除到左边之后与之前所提到的 大原则 一起可得：
 
将式  与：

做比较可得：

戍  
天/地  

这样第一页我们就完全破译啦！下面开始第二页的破译～
第二页
这一页的破译工作会异常轻松。首先我们看到了“积分”这个字眼，并且他说“啥啥（就是那个怪怪的公式），要必为简式”才可求其积分。所以我们不妨先来看看：

这是个啥？
由之前所总结的破译密码可知，天一定代表一个“变量”。而且我们还知道长得像垂直符号的那个符号等价于加法，因此我们推测：

长得像转置符号的那个符号  

而甲，乙，丙...啥的自然表示的就是常数  等等。至于寅卯午巳这些字，如果你愿意，可以定义为  等等，它们也都表示常数。因此，我们可以将其破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
同理，我们可以将：

破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
聪明的你一定发现了：

表达的就是不定积分的分部积分法：
 
破译密码为：

禾  
戌/亥  

最后是第三页：
第三页
有了之前两页的经验，相信这一页大家一定得心应手啦。在这一页中，所有的汉字数字与阿拉伯数字的含义是一致的。而天，地，人（这应该是人吧）表示的都是变量。因此我们可以设：
 
因此：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
而：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
显然，式  是式  的一个原函数。而丙上面加一个点表示的是积分常数  ，与普通的丙表示的  是不一样的（二丙，看起来像麻将）。
现在让我们看到最右边的：

这表示的显然是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
我一度认为左边是二阶导数。。。后来一想不对，如果是二阶导数的话“分母”上的二应该在双人旁后面。因此：

表示的是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
然后后面说可以将  ，进而：

表示的就是（注意 大原则 ）：

As the rules suggest, I&#x27;ll code for at least one hour everyday and share my status on social media. This will also act as a timeline blog of my journey as a Web Developer.

「时光不负，创作不停，本文正在参加2021年终总结征文大赛」
前言
又到了一年一度的年终总结，每到这个时间点,都是大家总结盘点一年的收获并立下新的一年的Flag的时候~
Flag与2021年的实现情况，并分享一些实现目标，战胜拖延症的实用方法，希望对大家有所帮助
2020年立下的Flag与完成情况

Flag就立在这里，下面我们来看下完成情况
[x] 掘金升级到LV4
[x] 做一个100以上star的Github开源项目
[x] 读几本计算机原理，计算机网络，数据结构等基础领域的书
[ ] 掌握flutter的使用与相关原理
[ ] 掌握android性能监控与优化的原理与使用
[x] 继续坚持ARTS打卡
[x] 继续坚持每周的总结与下周规划
可以看出，有些计划如期完成了，有些则不然,我感觉对于一年的长期计划来说，完成得还算不错
Flutter的学习由于决定先学习Compose于是被搁置了。而性能监控与优化，今年主要学习总结了布局优化，启动优化，内存优化等.
但还有不少内容如稳定性优化，网络优化等没有涉及到，同时感觉还有深入的空间,所以不能算完成。
2021年的收获
说实话，其实在2020年立下的Flag到底能不能实现，其实当时心里也是没什么底的，但今年一步一步走来,积少成多，的确有了一些小收获~
参加了掘金不少活动，集齐了衬衣，卫衣，搪瓷杯，抱枕等掘金周边（掘金yyds）
成功升级到掘金LV4（去年这个时候我还是个卑微的LV2）
Github拿到了大概400个Star(超预期完成)
学习并掌握了Compose的基本原理与使用，开源了多个Compose项目
读完了《图解Http》,《HeadFirst设计模式》,《深入理解Kotlin协程》等书
坚持了ARTS打卡与每周总结与下周规划
顺便打个广…</span>

在北京待了差不多半年，本想写北京，但其实细想，我似乎很难在北京找到一种放松的感觉。胡同的静是属于游客和大爷的，很难属于在这个城市工作的外来者。咖啡吧和下午茶是精致的悠闲，按摩不了紧绷的神经，长居城市的我们，偶尔也需要离开社交层面的部分自我，与自然进行一次近距离对话。
此外，漫步北京也许是容易的，漫步国庆却不是那么简单。于是我和朋友们选择在国庆「出逃」北京，途沿火山和草原，一路向西，到鄂尔多斯的沙漠折返，经过呼和浩特和山西大同，最终回到北京，在北京的西边画一个圈。
在北京的西边画一个圈
前期准备：自驾+住宿
越往城市边缘走，路上的风景就越多样，相比其他出行方式，自驾也许最合适来「走西口」
对比了各类租车软件后，我们最终选定在「神舟租车」上租一辆「宝沃BX5」。国庆五天的价格大概在 2640 元，平分到我们 4 个人大概是 660 元/人。这是国庆的价格，我看了一下大概在平常日价格的 3 倍以上，如果多人一起在平常日子里出游那真是很香了。
自驾过程中总共加了 2 次油，总价算到个人大概是 100+。这里要提醒大家的是，最后还车的时候记得一定要去加油站加满油，不然平台会扣除格外 100 元加油服务费。

住房上，我们有三晚住的是平常的旅店，另外一晚住的是蒙古包，都是两个人一间。出乎意料，最后每个人每天在住宿上花的价格大概在 100 元左右。下面是住宿的支出合计：

10.2 北京-草原天路-乌兰察布
10 点出发-下午经草原天路（桦皮林东入口-野狐岭出口）往乌兰察布-十点到达白影察干镇

革命不是请客吃饭、不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致、那样从容不迫。
但并不是所有的沃尔夫斯堡人都有这样的觉悟，他们抗拒这样的现实，所以坚定的改革派、大众集团 CEO Herbert Diess 又一次处在漩涡中心。
根据路透社消息，大众工会主席 Daniela Cavallo、大股东皮耶希、保时捷家族的代表，会在周二举办的监事会执行委员会议上讨论 Diess 的去留问题，并在 12 月 9 日前做出最后决定。这场危机距离 Diess 获得工作合同延长，雄心勃勃地发布 2030「NEW AUTO」战略，赢得改革的阶段性胜利仅仅过了 4 个月。

对于大众这种级别的巨人，大变革下的转身必然阵痛，注定不会平静。
百年未有之变局
2021 年是智能电动车继续狂飙突进的一年。国内市场新能源渗透在 9 月历史性地突破了 20%，而距离上一次突破新能源渗透率的历史性门槛「10%」，仅仅相差 5 个月。站在这波历史性的风口上，国内造车新势力三强「蔚小理」先后突破十万辆大关，0 到 1 的蜕变已经完成，并开始把触手伸向大众的欧洲大本营。

特斯拉一骑绝尘，上海工厂产能拉满，将弹药源源不断地输送到中国和欧洲市场，万亿美元的市值高过丰田、大众、通用等十余家传统车企之和。掌舵着财大气粗的大众集团，Diess 也不禁感叹，「特斯拉因为其高估值，可以无限地获得资金和资源。」
当然，大众已经是传统车企中转型电动化最积极的那一个，纯电品台 MEB 的 ID. 家族产品已经打向中欧美三大市场。Diess 可以在内部讲话中安抚大众员工，在中国，他们的电动产品第三季度销量比…</span>

                    <span>大家好，万维猫的老王又来啦。嗯，到这集为止，年番的第一个小副本结束了，也按照之前约定的，和大家聊聊这次年番剧本创作的一些想法。
矿场篇的五集在年番中属于比较短的段落篇幅，优点是铺垫不用很长，该收的线很容易收回来，节奏也会比较紧凑。从燕家堡特别篇开始全面接手导演和编剧工作以来，我就在思考和试验，真人风格的动画表现形式，对于节奏的要求显然比电视剧要快，但又不能一味的快，人物刻画和情绪渲染也很重要。所以我们会在年番中更注重人物的复杂性。比如这一集里给陈师姐加的这种欲言又止的情感，还有之前给宣乐赋予的理想主义瞬间，其实又何尝不是给韩立增加了一些情绪的锚点。
很多人物，如果你不看他，他可能就是个路人，但略微驻足，就能看到他们身上的种种线索思绪。正如出现在我们生命里的每个看似不经意的相遇，都会给我们带来无限的可能。所谓一期一会，见众生如见己，就是如此。
凡人的整体基调不能说是欢快的，终其一生，韩立都是过客，不是归人。他所探寻的，既是未知的尽头，也是存在的意义。当然，过程中的升级舔包这些喜闻乐见之事也可成为短暂的快乐源泉，但此行漫漫不知所终的未知与伤情，还有那些必将来到却无法改变的离别，才是韩立日复一日需要面对的大道无情，这与我们的一生又何其相似。
也许这就是为何很多纪元以后，身在仙界的韩天尊，还会偶然想起那个在天南山间乘舟凌水而行的黄昏，还有那盛开在漫山遍野的白色野菊花。

Adding SASS / SCSS support
Setting up Eslint and Prettier
Setting up Eslint to run automatically before every commit (via a Git hook)
Setting up Semantic Commits (via a Git hook)
Any of the above items are optional and can be skipped during the process. For example, if you are not familiar with Semantic Commits or do not plan to use it, you can skip that part and move on to another.
You may want to bookmark this article and use it as a reference when creating your projects. I will try to keep it up to date, and when I discover a new useful feature, I will include it here.
Let&#x27;s get started.

And a difference between the many programming languages you can choose from, is that they have different sets of rules for how you work with different data types. Those rules, are called type systems, or typing d…</span>

                    <span>Today, I had time to do some coding 🧑🏼‍💻 😀
I started my Saturday early, with a 6am presentation (my time) to one of our Twitter Developer Communities, in India. It was a fun run through of what’s available in the brand new version of the Twitter API, with a live demo using our Postman Collection 💻 I also took some really great questions from the folks in the live stream, so I appreciated the opportunity.
@andypiper

      
After that (and, several cups of ☕), I thought I’d have a play with something that caught my eye a couple of weeks ago - the new Glitch in Bio starter template from the great folks over at Glitch. I&#x27;d seen the news about it, and the follow-up post about the generated sites being Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and I had been keen to have a play for a few days... but Re…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s hard to maintain a state. Harder to maintain a UI. And near impossible to keep a user happy.
No matter how well you plan, disintegration always happens.
React is a well-known web UI library with a long history of state implementation. Components shape the application. But it&#x27;s a state&#x27;s job to keep it inside the sanity borders.
That is unless it drives the developer insane before achieving this goal!
We know how the seasons pass. In spring, flowers bloom. In summer, sweats run down the armpits. With autumn, leaves leave the branches. And who will forget the snowy days of winter? (Hint: People who live after global warming makes its debut!)

                    <span>Polar charts often look impressive, which makes some people think that creating them is a tricky process demanding plenty of skills and expertise. Well, I am going to debunk this myth right now! Let me show you how to easily visualize data in a beautiful interactive JavaScript Polar Chart.
Fundamentally, a polar chart is a variation of a circular graph drawn with polar coordinates. It can also work well to visualize some sorts of categorical data for comparisons, which is exactly the case I want to demonstrate now. In this tutorial, I will build a column polar chart, with the bars growing from the center of the diagram to represent values with their length.

                    <span>Time for some regular expressions! Just like with the CSS episode, we won&#x27;t use them for intended purpose, we&#x27;ll use them for programming!
Technically I&#x27;ll count this as a Sed episode.
Sed is a very simple limited-purpose programming language which supports regular expressions and some really few other things. A sed script, usually a shell one-liner, is run separately on every line of input. It&#x27;s still used in many shell scripts where one command produces some text, then sed reshuffles it a bit with regular expressions, then another command consumes it.
I don&#x27;t really approve of this style of programming, and I think you&#x27;re better off using proper script in Ruby, Python, or Perl pretty much every single scenario - it will be much clearer, actually testable, and very often more concise as w…</span>

                    <span>Javascript always has some surprises in store. for example, typeof [] return object and not array. This has historical reasons. But this can be very confusing
How can you then properly check if something is an array?
For example, you could check if the constructor is an array.
([]).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
(new Array).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
({}).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(true).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(null).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError
(undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError

As you can see this has a problem. With null and undefined a TypeError is thrown. 
You could catch this for example with a try/catch.
try {
  (undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
} catch(e) {
}

But you don&#x27;t want that.
There is also this exotic possibility to check if it is …</span>

                    <span>If the C: drive is running out of space, we can move our WSL2 file system to another drive in a few steps.
If we are using an user different than root, we need to know it, running the whoami command (WSL side):

Also we need to know the distro name and WSL version, running the wsl --list --verbose command on PowerShell (Windows Side):

Knowing the username: equiman, the linux distribution: Ubuntu, and confirm that we are using the WSL 2 version, we are ready to...

All next steep need to be done on PowerShell (Windows Side).
First we need to shutdown WSL to avoid data corruption. Close all WSL terminals that are using it and then run the wsl --shutdown command.
Next we are going to create a backup from our Ubuntu linux distribution.
mkdir D:\backup
wsl --export Ubuntu D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

Don&#x27;t worry if you not see progress indicators. This can be take a while depending how much data you have. Maybe it&#x27;s good idea take a rest.

When finish, we need to to unregister the linux distribution from C: drive. It will also release the disk space.
wsl --unregister Ubuntu

And then, import again on our new disk. I&#x27;ll use D: disk as an example.
mkdir D:\WSL
wsl --import Ubuntu D:\WSL\ D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

By default Ubuntu will use root as default user, to switch to our user (equiman in my case) we need to run this commands.
cd $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
ubuntu config --default-user equiman

Ensure replacing equiman with yours.
Restart WSL running wsl command and it&#x27;s done.
That’s All Folks!
Happy Coding 🖖</span>

                    <span>今年称得上是「游戏小年」，这点想必喜欢玩游戏的读者们都有同感；从去年同期到现在，整个业界尚未拿出一款投入高质量强，既叫好又叫座的高水平作品。那几款玩家们盼望已久的超级大作，发售后却接连遭遇口碑上的滑铁卢；而更多让人翘首以待的作品，全都抢着把发售档期排到了 2022 年。
不过，虽然超大型制作没能带来亮眼表现，但今年值得一玩的作品并不少。它们要么内容扎实，可以支撑你玩上很长一段时间；要么有着独特的创意和新奇的玩法，能让你体验到特别的乐趣。
每年的这个时候，都是游戏厂商们疯狂打折促销的日子，各个平台也会推出主题促销活动；有意思的是，今年 Steam 的秋季特卖还比之前延长了 1 天，12 月 1 日才会结束。
这次我们也为大家整理了一些值得入手的史低游戏，不妨趁着「黑五」特惠，用便宜的价格买下几款心仪的作品；在为今年划上圆满句号的同时，也能用一颗充满期待的心去迎接未来。
注意：不同平台的折扣截止日期不一致，具体详情请以对应平台的商店页面信息为准。
双人成行

想必这会是很多人心中的年度最佳作品之一，它拥有充满天马行空般想象力的关卡设计，以及令人眼花缭乱的各式玩法；而无论小游戏还是 Boss 战，它也充分利用了二人协作的机制，没有将这一卖点流于纸面。
本作在 Steam、Xbox 和 PS 平台上皆有折扣，支持本地双人同屏或者联网游戏。值得一提的是，第二个玩家通过「好友通行证」即可和你一同畅玩，不需要买两份。
此外，你也可以通过办理 EA Play 玩到本作。

前言
如今市面上笔记类或者知识管理类软件太多，甚至每个月都能看见一款新产品的上线。工具本身并没有优劣，它们只是反映了工具使用者的需求和工作流。虽然不应该舍本逐末般沉迷于工具本身的研究，但依然不妨碍我们去探索和寻找新的工具来完善自己的信息管理。
今年年初的时候，我偶然间知道了 Anytype 这款知识管理软件，瞬间被它的「本地化 Notion」的用户评价所吸引，于是立即填写 表格，加入 Anytype 的测试计划。
Anytype 目前可以填写申请表格，每个月大概40-50人
六月份的时候，我收到了测试邀请（onboarding program），但是由于时差的缘故没法参加在线介绍。当我在十一月收到新的测试邀请时，没有丝毫地犹豫就加入了。
来自 Anytype 工程师的邀请邮件
在产品说明会议里，CEO Zhanna Sharipova 简单介绍了 Anytype 的发展路径、当前主要功能以及未来愿景，工程师 Enda Crowley 实时展示了一些基本操作。
产品介绍 Zoom 会议（Onboarding Session）
会议结束之后，Enda 立即发送了 Anytype 的下载和对应社区邀请链接。有趣的是，本周Anytype 又推出了 iOS 测试版本。截至 2021 年 11 月，Anytype 目前支持桌面端有 MacOS、Windows 以及 Linux，移动平台有 Android 以及 iOS。

If he dies, his world is deleted. Will he survive? Yea,  because he probably wouldn&#x27;t upload the video if he didn&#x27;t. Enjoy and stay notable!

                    <span>One way is using function parameter and another way is using extension function.
There could be more than 2 ways to implement binding adapters, but this is what I know. Let&#x27;s look at what binding adapters are first.
Binding adapter is used for implementing custom attribute in your layout file. For example, instead of using the defaultandroid:text attribute, you want to customize it by creating a new attribute app:customText.

                    <span>Introduction


Software engineering is a field that is regularly changing. Thus, developers must be continual learners to stay sharp.
However, motivating yourself to learn and creating a lasting habit can be difficult, especially if you&#x27;re self-studying outside of school or work.  Below are four techniques that I use to stay motivated while learning.
Set deadlines
Gamify
Spice it up
Identify the end goal
Learning without structure can feel like an endless task with no end in sight; it&#x27;s often nice to have a sense of progress. I&#x27;ve found that artificial deadlines give me something to work toward and cleanly mark progress.
Here are some examples of deadlines you could set for yourself:
I will study Python for 30 minutes by the end of the day
I will complete one module of my online JavaScript…</span>

                    <span>We all want to see a return on our investment, especially when creating applications, which require significant resources.
You spent money, your time, put in a lot of effort, and finally, your app is ready. Now comes the new challenge: what to charge for your app?
The decision depends on many factors. The number of working hours, testing costs, marketing and promotion, purchase of any licenses are some aspects that define the overall cost of development. Calculate the costs first, then set the price for the app.
To put an adequate price tag on your product, first, let&#x27;s look at the different pricing models.
Understanding the pros and cons of pricing models will help you choose the best option for you.
It is essential to find the balance between the price that customers are ready to pay and…</span>

                    <span>Context


Our company has organized &quot;Secret Santa&quot;, pre-covid times. I got the name of a nerdy colleague and a friend. I decided to gift him Amazon gift coupon. Like people usually do - hiding gift somewhere in desk, I instead created an online puzzle like a treasure hunt using some automation. If he solves he will receive gift on his email.
Printed a bar code on a paper and put it on my friend&#x27;s workstation desk. Upon scanning, it redirects to a simple website I&#x27;ve created using wixsite.com.
Here&#x27;s the picture of printed barcode along with other gifts -


The landing page shows following instruction -
 
To get your gift all you need is an email address.
Before I tell you more, why don&#x27;t you give a try yourself to find the email address? Here&#x27;s the link after scanning barcode - https://turantsephele.wixsite.com/giftgenerator

Once you click &quot;Get email address&quot;, it redirects you to another page which shows a timer and nothing else. And with a small hidden button somewhere in page.
If you are able to find the button and click, it redirects you to brainfuck visualizer with some pre-populated code. 
I&#x27;ve written this code in brainfuck and when you run it outputs next hint.
That brainfuck code outputs a simple string -
Decode:747572616e7473657068656c6540676d61696c2e636f6d

After decoding, it gives you the email address.
I have created a IFTTT flow which triggers when there is an incoming email with subject &quot;HOG RIEEDERRRRR&quot; and it is from my friend&#x27;s email address.
Once this condition matches, IFTTT sends an email back with gift coupon details.
Once timer ran out it reveals a link to brainfuck visualizer code.
If he can&#x27;t solve the puzzle in 3 days, an email triggers and sent gift coupon details to friend&#x27;s email address. Again using IFTTT.
That&#x27;s all folks!

                    <span>Many modern web platforms leverage on maps and location-based features to provide services to users. Some popular examples of this are Uber and Airbnb. 
With the  TomTom Maps SDK , including a map in your website has never been easier. The toolkit enables access to various mapping features including street maps, real-time traffic conditions, fuzzy search and route planning for travellers.
As a developer, you can leverage on TomTom&#x27;s APIs methods to build and customize maps in your web or mobile application.
Let&#x27;s walkthrough the process of adding a map to your website using the TomTom Maps SDK. In the end, I&#x27;ll include a link to the source code for this project for reference.

                    <span>This week I successfully published my Static Site Generator static-dodo as an NPM package.
After creating an account at npmjs.com I used the command npm login from the terminal to link my npm account.
I changed the version in package.json to 1.0.0 and also added a tag to my latest commit with:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &quot;1.0.0 Release&quot;

I then published my project using the command npm publish. 
After I made some changes to the repo, I decided to unpublish the package and start from the beginning. I decided to rebrand the project from &quot;dodo-ssg&quot; to &quot;static-dodo&quot; and publish it with the new name.
Gus McCallum tested the program on his computer by installing it with:

Linear Regression is the first algorithm in the Demystifying Machine Learning series and in this article we&#x27;ll be discussing Linear Regression using Normal equation. This article covers what is Linear Regression, how it works, the maths behind the normal equation method, fixing some edge cases, handling overfitting and code implementation.
Linear Regression in simple terms is fitting the best possible linear hypothesis (a line or a hyperplane) on the data having a linear relationship so that we can predict the new unknown data point with the least possible error. It&#x27;s not necessary to have a linear relationship in data but having such can lead to approximately close predictions. For a reference take a look at the below representation.

Eleven weeks ago when I started in Open Source Development 600 at Seneca I never thought I would get to the point of actually releasing something into the wild. Over the term we have been working on our individual static site generators. The purpose of these tools is to take a text file or Markdown file and parse it into a valid HTML document. 
It can include a variety of features depending on the student, but some of the options for my own textToHTML include stylesheets, using a config file instead of the command line, and having an output option to specify a folder to put the HTML documents into.
Throughout the weeks, we have been contributing to Open Source projects on GitHub and making pull requests. Included in this is the idea of contributing to each other&#x27;s SSG&#x27;s. Coll…</span>

                    <span>Does anyone NOT use a debugger? I can&#x27;t remember the last time I did. It&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t dislike them, I just don&#x27;t need to use them. The main reason for this is because I have a certain development methodology that either produces less bugs, catches them at a unit test level, or makes tracking them down much easier.
Here are my tips...
1. Write your own COS cheat-sheet.
This is mainly for anyone that is new to COS. One of the biggest bug hazards is not knowing how certain commands and functions work. Take the time to play with a language and try out all of its variances. The process of then documenting your own cheat-sheet will cement the knowledge and provide a quick reference review tool. Not only will you become more productive, but you will certainly write less of those a…</span>

This post will cover some of the things I learned along the way. I mostly from a TypeScript/Node background and will make comparisons between the two where applicable.
I have found that having a tangible end goal increases my odds of project completion by nearly 100%. In this case, the goal is to create a command line program that simply POSTs requests to my personal notes application engram.
This is not just a learning or for fun project as I recently realized that the command line is a great place for the input of quick notes. When I’m working, I sometimes find myself investigating something in the terminal and realize that I have a thought that I’d …</span>

本周话题：美国宪法拍卖，一个区块链案例
上周四（11月18日），美国纽约有一场拍卖会，拍卖第一版印刷的美国宪法。这件事很有意思，因为它跟区块链有关。
两百多年前，美国打赢了独立战争，13个殖民地的代表聚在一起开会，起草了宪法，决定建国。

宪法通过后，一共印刷了500份，让代表们带回各州。留存到现在的有13份，其中只有一份在私人手里，这次拍卖的就是它。


一个区块链爱好者看到了这件事。晚上在群里聊天，他随口提了一句，有人就说：&quot;我们集资去参加吧！&quot;
大伙一听，觉得很好玩，通过区块链，向全世界的网友集资，去竞标一件古董。以前没人这么干过，就让我们试试看，证明技术有这个潜力。
说干就干，他们就在区块链上成立了一个组织，叫做&quot;宪法 DAO&quot;（ConstitutionDAO），专门负责这件事，相当于项目公司。
他们注册了域名 ConstitutionDAO.com，整个网站只有一个页面（下图），解释了整件事情。

下面就是最关键的部分了，怎么才能收到钱呢？
令人意想不到的是，这反而是最容易的部分。专门的区块链工具，都已经开发出来了，在互联网上公开提供服务，可以直接拿来用。
集资服务叫做 Juicebox（下图）。它将每个项目的合约，写入区块链，并提供一个钱包接收资金。所有提供资金的人，会收到项目的代币，作为出资证明，享受相应的权益。

有了集资账户还不够，还必须让大家相信，项目组织者不会卷款跑路。大伙转账以后，组织者将这些钱转到他的个人钱包，那可…</span>

笼子和翅膀，你更喜欢哪一个？

@潘誉晗：电影以音乐剧作曲家乔纳森·拉森的故事为蓝本，讲述了 1990 年为了梦想而不断奋斗的乔。即使工作不是一帆风顺，即使走商业路线可以给他带来更好的生活，可他始终没有放弃，只因那不是他心里真的想要呈现给观众的故事。

这些 App 值得买
Affnity
今年，Affinity 提供了全场 7 折优惠活动，这里包括桌面应用、插件、工作手册等内容，另外针对 iPad 应用提供更为给力的 5 折优惠！对于从事图形设计、排版的用户来说，由于 Affinity 的创意设计应用均采用了一次买断制，也许是比 Adobe 更为实惠的选择。

台式机应用
支持 Windows 以及 macOS，三款套件 Affinity Photo、Affinity Designer、Affinity Publisher 分别对标 Adobe Photoshop、Adobe illustrator、Adobe InDesign，涵盖图像处理、矢量图设计以及桌面排版，但 Affinity 系列整体上要比 Adobe 套件轻量得多。

Affinity Designer（ ¥348 → ￥248）
Affinity Photo（¥348 → ¥248）
Affinity Publisher（¥348 → ¥248）

iPadOS 版 Affnity 应用
iPadOS 版的 Affinity Photo 和 Affinity Designer 拥有与台式机版同样强大的功能，其便携性非常适合将 iPad 带出去完成工作。

Affinity Designer for iPad（¥148 → ￥68）

作为 2019 年才入坑 F1 的萌新车迷，我想借本文分享一下自己的入坑经历和路径推荐。如果有小伙伴因为近期大热的中国车手周冠宇而对 F1 产生了一点兴趣，可以通过这篇文章更快地进入 F1 的世界。我也会在文中简单介绍一下目前的 F1 格局和规则，老车友亦可温故知新。
引言
随着周冠宇加入 F1 阿尔法罗密欧车队的消息正式公布，史上第一位来自中国大陆的正式车手将要征战下赛季 F1 的新闻一夜刷屏。在关于中国车手的讨论中，有人为华人在赛车领域的成就而喝彩，也有部分网友质疑他是花钱「买」位置、「带资进组」等，引发了一些争议。
那么，对于一个不了解 F1 比赛的人来说，这个坑到底值不值得入呢？
我们还是先了解一下，F1 到底是啥比赛，以及好看在哪儿。
F1 是什么？看点在哪里？
很多小伙伴一听到 F1，基本第一反应就是舒马赫和法拉利，毕竟这是 F1 几十年历史中最为成功的车手和车队。但除此之外，大部分非爱好者就了解不多了，可能只会偶尔在体育新闻里零星听到过奔驰车队夺得几连冠、刘易斯汉密尔顿拿到个人第 100 个大奖赛冠军之类的新闻。
F1 是什么比赛
F1 全称为 Formula One，中文名叫一级方程式赛车，是一个由 国际汽车联盟 举办的最高等级的 赛车 比赛。名称中「方程式」是指一组所有参赛车辆都必须遵守的规则。F1 一年为一个赛季，包括一系列二十多场大奖赛（Grand Prix），每场比赛的结果算入积分系统并以此确定两个年度世界冠军：一个颁予车手，一个颁予车队1。
F1 被很多人认为是赛车界最重要的赛事，同时也是最昂贵的体育运动…</span>

OPPO 新品发布会

OPPO 于 11 月 25 日正式发布全面升级的人像视频手机 OPPO Reno7 系列手机，新机前置猫眼镜头采用了和索尼一同研发的全新 RGBW 传感器——IMX709，从根本上提升感光能力，传感器逻辑层上内置 OPPO 自研硬件级 IP 即 RGBW 图像处理单元，同时采用DTI像素隔离技术，显著减少了像素之间的信号串扰，从而有效提升信噪比，避免偏色、伪色等现象，这使得该机目前成为了前置摄像头感光能力最强的手机，相对 Reno6 感光能力提升 60%，同时画面噪点降低 35%。且得益于硬件级 DOL-HDR 功能支持，IMX709 具备更强的动态范围能力，在暗光、逆光环境下对人像细节的捕捉和呈现比传统 RGGB 传感器也更具优势。

后置镜头部分则搭载 OPPO 与索尼联合开发的 IMX766 旗舰级主摄，带来更丰富的拍摄玩法，人像模式 2.0 能够实现接近单反的人像虚化和光斑效果，开启 AI 场景增强后能根据暗光、逆光等复杂环境下，自动调用月光夜景算法与 Live-HDR 算法，深度还原人脸肤色与背景。

工艺上首次将航天级光刻工艺应用于手机后盖，通过激光显影技术在晶钻工艺基础上二次光刻，形成 120 万道细密光栅纹理，让玻璃后壳具备流星雨般的视觉观感和立体触感。在机身正面，Reno7 系列采用行业领先的极窄边框工艺，将屏占比提升至 92.8%，镜头模组上引入光纤热弯工艺，将 1mm 直径的光纤环绕主摄系统一周形成呼吸灯效果，并采用陶瓷彩镀镜圈，实现光哑一体设计，将主摄镜头的防刮耐磨性能提升至普通金属的 10 倍。

硬件配置上，Reno7 Pro 和 Reno7 分别搭载天玑 1200-MAX 和骁龙 778G；前者为游戏玩家带来了 90 FPS 极限稳帧、超级闪电启动 2.0 和全场景网络优化，内置 4500 mAh …</span>

                    <span>写在开头的话
其实早在情报贴放出来的时候，讨论群里面关于人吃人的话题早已吵翻天了，但是直到看到完整的漫画正文，笔者收获到的却是一份更为沉重的感悟，米二真正想告诉读者的并不是吃人肉这种猎奇向的噱头，而是探讨长生不老之人如何做到对”初心“的坚守。

初心，也就是笔者之前在其他分析文中提到过的”道“。如果有兴趣的读者可以回去看下笔者关于”道“的分析。在此就不多做赘述了，开始本期的分析。
如何看待无根生的“道”
一、长生不老的诱惑
在中西方各个文明圈中，“长生不老”都是一个永恒且共通的话题。古今中外都有无数的人为之疯狂，希望去寻找答案。古人寻找修仙之法、寻找灵丹妙药；现代的科学家探索细胞分裂，研究人类的基因，也寄希望于能够找到永生的答案。
东方求长生
自古就有所谓当了皇帝想成仙，我真的还想再活五百年之类的愿望。
《太上纯阳真经·了三得一经》：“天一生水，人同自然，肾为北极之枢，精食万化，滋养百骸，赖以永年而长生不老。”
从秦始皇派徐福出海寻找蓬莱、瀛洲诸仙山上的仙人，欲求长生不老药为开端。而其后二千多年的帝王们，在追求长生不老药这件事上献出生命者络绎不绝。
汉武帝刘彻在追求长生不死的帝王队伍中也是“出类拔萃”的一位，甚至比秦始皇嬴政还疯狂。汉武帝追求长生不死在《史记·武帝本纪》中有很多篇幅。几乎一半的篇幅都在讲汉武帝终其一生如何宠信方士，如何劳师动众追求仙药。[1]
唐太宗，这又是一位千古一帝，历史上有名的明君，但也一心追求长生不老。唐太宗曾嘲笑过秦始皇和汉武帝，说秦始皇想求长生被方士骗了，说汉武帝求神仙，把女儿也嫁给了方士。可惜没想到的是晚年的唐太宗也迷恋上了长生不老，长生不死，甚至还被所谓的“不老神药”毒死。新旧唐书和资治通鉴都有唐太宗晚年食丹药的记载，类似吃长生不老药。史料记载，“服胡僧药，遂致暴疾不救”。[2]
跟唐太宗一样，嘉靖皇帝也迷恋长生不老，长生不死，大量服食丹药。…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched but even though it has been 6 years since the release of Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is STILL making the same mistakes. It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. 

I saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.

Halo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. 

So again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release

Landing your first engineering role after getting a degree in computer science (or software engineering) is a challenging process. 
There are so many software engineering vacancies, but a significant majority of them are for those with at least 2+ years of experience. There are not enough junior positions on the market, so the competition for entry-level roles is high. Yet, it is still possible to land an engineering role, even without experience. 
The following tips are mainly dedicated to computer science or software engineering graduates looking to land their first engineering role. However, self-taught developers and boot-camp graduates can still benefit from this article.

import &quot;./index.css&quot;;
import App from &quot;./App&quot;;
import reportWebVitals from &quot;./reportWebVitals&quot;;

Testing it: check the console in inspect to see how it increments and decrements.

                    <span>If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.
Displaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.
In this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.
The procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.
The first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.
When you move it, you can paste this code for the script:
GIT&#x3D;&#x60;xcrun -find git&#x60;
GIT_REV&#x3D;&#x60;${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD&#x60;
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c &quot;Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}&quot; &quot;${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}&quot;

In the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.
Now, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.
To display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:
let revision &#x3D; Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: &quot;REVISION&quot;) as? String 

In Objective-C we would do it like this:
NSString *revision &#x3D; [NSBundle.mainBundle objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@&quot;REVISION&quot;];</span>

This article presents an open-source Flask Dashboard crafted with authentication, database, and Docker support on top of Azia Admin, a colorful dashboard template. The product can be used to prototype fast a new dashboard on top of the existing codebase. For newcomers, Flask is a leading framework written in Python used to code from simple websites to microservices, APIs, or complex eCommerce solutions. 
Thanks for reading! 
👉 Flask Azia Admin - product page
👉 Flask Azia Admin - LIVE Demo

Azia Dashboard is a beautifully designed admin template featuring a fine selection of useful Bootstrap components and elements. The pre-built pages of the templates are intuitive and very well-designed.
Azia features many essential utility classes that can help cut down CSS bloat and modify CSS components instantly.
The product requires a minimal programming kit to be present and properly installed in the workstation in order to clone and compile the sources:
Python3 - the language that powers Flask
GIT - used to download the sources from Github
A modern editor like VsCode or Atom


Docker - (optional) for an automatized setup
Probably the most easier way to use the product is via Docker, a popular virtualization and containerization software.
👉 Step #1 - Download the source code
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-azia-dashboard.git
$ cd flask-azia-dashboard

👉 Step #2 - Start in Docker
$ docker-compose pull   # download dependencies 
$ docker-compose build  # local set up
$ docker-compose up -d  # start the app 

Once all the above commands are executed, we should see the starter running in the browser at the address http://localhost:85

                    <span>Storecle is a neat uni-directional app state management for React and Solid (❤️).
Storecle uses a simple mental model which lets you access app-wide actions and their results by using Context API.
To improve the code re-usability, Data Suppliers use a middleware pattern. They are executed in the order you specify and pass a snapshot of Store from one to another, letting you split the logic into small, specified functions.
It works with both React and Solid (it&#x27;s framework agnostic to certain degree).
It uses Context API and useEffect / createEffect to provide action re-triggers based on specified Store changes.
It facilitates splitting the business logic into granual, re-usable functions by applying a middleware pattern.

                    <span>Now we are going to learn how to create a Nodejs and express CRUD application. A CRUD application is the simplest web  application that we can create. The term CRUD comes from  &quot;Create,&quot; &quot;Read,&quot; &quot;Update&quot;, and &quot;Delete.&quot;  We create CRUDs Applications using the HTTP Verbs. In this tutorial we are also going to learn how to connect and use  a MongoDB Database in a Nodejs application. In this tutorial we assume that you have some JavaScript knowledge. We also assume that you have read something about MongoDB. You can take this tutorial as a second part for our Nodejs and Express Tutorial. Now let us start learning.
In this tutorial we are going to build the simplest Nodejs and express application. Applications like this serve as part of  more complex applications. The application will be a list…</span>

I am a backend software engineer in N26, Barcelona office. In N26 we use kotlin and we build microservices, as you can imagine, to run the digital bank.
We were working on a backoffice microservice, that somehow handled some data about our customers and exposed some endpoints to change them (like a CRUD but not exactly).
So I cannot tell the problem using the same data because those are privileged, but I can explain the same problem using a simpler example.
Suppose you have a model in your application to store information about a Person:
data class Person(
 val name: String, 
 val address: Address
)

data class Address(
 val streetName: String, 
 val number: String, 
 val city: String
) 

Now imagine you have an endpoint and so a do…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin. Today, I&#x27;d like to talk about my experience of publishing my static site generator to NPM. It&#x27;s quite a fun experience as I finally made my project up and running in public.
I&#x27;ve used this as instruction to publish it to NPM.
You can check it out here
Because I already built my project for quite a long time so, I can skip most of the steps, and just focus on this step and some steps that help me understand the semantic versioning and dist-tags. 
When I first start using command line npm publish to publish the project, I had to sign up and log in to NPM. But I encountered an error where it said something like this
npm ERR! code E403
npm ERR! 403 403 Forbidden - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/cv-ssg - Forbidden

                    <span>If you were building an application consisting of a user interface and an API, what technology choices would you make and why?
I&#x27;ll go first.
1. TypeScript
2. React &amp; Next.js
React is a battle-tested library for building UI&#x27;s. It has good documentation and a large community. There are so many components already implemented and ready to use, so you don&#x27;t have to build everything yourself.
Next.js has been around for only a couple of years, but it is already one of the most popular tools in the React ecosystem. Next.js offers you so much out of the box. SSR, file-system-based routing, has the potential to improve metrics such as time-to-first-draw (TTFD) and so much more...
3. PostgreSQL or MongoDB

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but I fall asleep every time I’m trying to read typescript documentation. There is something in the way it is written that signals to my brain that I should not even attempt to comprehend it until I had a good night’s sleep, three coffees, and ideally some chocolate to stimulate the brain cells. I think I now found my purpose for the next few months: I want to re-write typescript documentation in a way that is actually understandable by a casual reader 😊
Let&#x27;s start with one of the pain points many developers are struggling with: generics! And we’re going to start with a bottom-up approach: let’s implement a component without generics, and introduce them only when we need them.

AWS CodePipeline helps in orchestrating CI/CD pipeline all the way from building and testing to deploying applications, from development to production environments.
However, one of the limitations of AWS CodePipeline is its inability to dynamically execute or skip any pipeline action.
This post demonstrates how to setup a CI/CD pipeline to dynamically orchestrate and execute actions based on inputs
This solution uses the following AWS services:
AWS CodeCommit – Source Control
AWS CodeBuild – Build System
AWS CodePipeline – Continuous Delivery
AWS Step Functions - Workflow automation using state machines
A change or commit to the code in the CodeCommit application repository triggers CodePipeline with the help of a CloudWatch event.
The pipeline downloads the code from the Co…</span>

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve just studied html, css and basic javascript and are starting with some framework that uses node, like react, you may have some doubts about managing dependencies. 
So let&#x27;s take a look at some useful commands and get rid of the fear of play with package.json!
First, let&#x27;s create the package.json file using the following command in the terminal:
npm init -y
With this command, we generate a standard package.json file like this:
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;project-name&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;
}

When working with node, some dependencies are used for development purposes and others will remain until the end. So we will have two…</span>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shifting recruiting from a human to largely computer-based process. AI is being used to assist HR in the entire process of candidate selection — from curating job descriptions to conducting early-stage interviews. While this can greatly reduce the number of applications that employers shift through, some have voiced legal and ethical concerns when it comes to AI-based recruiting.

                    <span>.NET SDKs including .NET Core, .NET 5 and .NET 6 support cross-platform. For some reason, you might feel like removing the latest preview version of SDK or a certain version of SDK. You can then use many different methods to delete the SDK and runtime. In this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss the manual way of removing a specific version of the .NET SDK and runtime from MacOS.
In your terminal in Mac OS, type the command, dotnet --list-sdks, and you will see the whole list of .NET SDKs you&#x27;ve installed so far, including the full path.

This time, run the command, dotnet --list-runtimes, to get the whole list of the installed .NET runtimes.

Did you find some differences between SDKs and runtimes, other than the paths? That&#x27;s right. Although you say .NET 6, the SDK and the runtime versions are sl…</span>

很多读者都会好奇少数派的编辑们到底平时都「买了啥」。我们希望通过「编辑部的新玩意」介绍编辑部成员们最近在用的新奇产品，让他们自己来谈谈这些新玩意的使用体验究竟如何。

@北鸮：华硕 ROG 游侠 RX 光学机械键盘

购买渠道：淘宝自购
入手价格：649 元

和手感显在、特点鲜明的段落轴相比，线性轴体之间的手感差异就非常微妙了。除去按键时能直接感受到的压力克数的差别，线性轴的手感差异还体现在弹簧回弹速度（一定程度上决定了轴体是否「跟手」）、轴心稳定性（影响按在边角处的力度变化）、材质和模具精度（会影响轴体的声音与顺滑程度）等等。我自己很爱线性轴，一直希望用上一个压力克数不高、高速回弹、轴心稳定性极好、还能超级顺滑的轴体——其实我也没这么龟毛，是个线性轴我就能用，但之前能最接近我个人所有手感需求的轴体，只有我自己换了更轻的双段弹簧、全面润滑的、新换完模具的樱桃黑轴。我自己都嫌麻烦，这么折腾出来够拼一把键盘的轴就给我累个够呛，发誓再也不弄了。
之所以看上这把 ROG 的光轴键盘，是因为它搭载的 RX 光轴在许多个键盘评测视频里被称作「最强量产线性轴」，作为一个线性轴爱好者，我一直盯着它却不忍心下手。一号那天，ABS 键帽版的游侠 RX 突然从 899 降到了 599，新的 PBT 键帽版本也只要 699 元（我找到的 649 价格已经卖没了）——光这套替换键帽本身就要 200 块，看见这个价格，我想都没想，直接下单。
超长的左 Ctrl 是主要特征
朋友们，到手试机的一瞬间，我就明白之前 ROG 那只大眼睛收来的税都用来干吗了。
ROG 自研的 RX 光轴用了火山口的结构，中置 LED，这样的结构上次见到还是在被我喷得狗血淋头的罗技自研的 Romer-G。Ro…</span>

                    <span>随着感恩节而来的，就是黑色星期五了。这被等同于「海外双十一」的购物节即将来临，不知道你海淘的心有没有荡漾起来？我们挑选了一些数字生活圈子里面一些叫得上名字的东西，看看它们在黑五期间有怎样的折扣和优惠～
智能手机
Google Pixel
Google Pixel 近年以来的热度可以说是只增不减，从它在少数派新玩意栏目的出现频率，已经是可见一斑了。凭借 Google 神一般的优化，Google Pixel 利用并非出色的硬件达到了相当令人满意的流畅度与智能体验，同时整体的机身设计也常常是令人称赞。当然了，整个 Pixel 系列的拍照表现也一直是手机摄影界个中翘楚，而且大陆也没得买，所以 Google Pixel 也成为了海淘手机时很多人的首选。
Pixel 6

Pixel 6 尽管上市不久，但是其亚马逊海外购的价格已经开始下降。如今，128 GB 版本的黑色 Pixel 6 在 亚马逊海外购 已经是 4329.17 元的价格（预估税费为 399.29 元），从英国发货。除了发货时间比较长（1-2 个月）之外，这个价格本身已经是比较合适的价格了。Google Pixel 6 采用 Google 自研的 Tensor 处理器，尽管在实际性能上可能比不过 Snapdragon 888，但是在 Google 的调教下，Android 12 的流畅度是自不用说的。
Pixel 5a

Pixel 5a 本身相对于 5G 版 Pixel 4a 的升级并不大：高通骁龙 765G、6GB RAM，在流畅使用上基本不会有什么问题，主要在续航上有了不小的改进。如今在 Google Store，黑五折扣的情况下，Pixel 5a 的价格还下调了 50 美元，来到了 399 美元；但是需要找到靠谱的转运才能够购买。在 亚马逊海外购 上，Pixel 5a 的价格是 3720 元（预估税费为 372.…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70123">

                    <span>1Password 在少数派绝对算得上是一个「多数派」。作为一款 2006 年发家于 macOS 平台的密码管理应用，可以说是引领着同类应用发展的「老大哥」。然而这位德高望重的老大哥却在今年「翻车」了，如果你还不清楚前因后果，可以 点击此处 了解。
在这样沸沸扬扬的争议声中测试了半年，开发团队终于正式发布全新的 1Password 8 版本（8.4.0），不知是亟待 Windows 用户认可，还是 Electron 框架真的高效，首次面向大众的竟然是 Windows 版本（macOS 现在处于 公开测试阶段）。怎么说也是三年磨一剑的大版本更新，不如让我们将主观印象先放一边，来看看 1Password 8 到底带来了哪些变化。
界面风格统一，更活泼多彩的外观设计
以往应用评测都会把不同平台区分清楚，以免造成混淆，但由于 1Password 8 统一使用 Electron 编写 UI，Windows 版和 macOS 版几乎是从一个模子里刻出来。除了窗口三键位置默认不同，以及 Windows 版将 macOS 版集成在系统菜单栏中的功能移到了左侧栏右上角的「…」中，其他 UI 设计和交互逻辑不能说十分相似，只能说完全一致。想想自己一篇评测能当两篇用，忽然理解 AgileBits 为什么死磕 Electron 了（并不是）。
开发者介绍文档从「全新」的锁屏开始，那我们就如他所愿。1Password 8 锁屏将 7.X 上下打开的解锁动画改回了更早的左右开启，并增加了用户头像，以后与你密切相关的不再是各种「独立库」，而是绑定订阅账号，从这个界面似乎就能读出开发者的更新方向。

解锁后的主界面，新版依旧保留了三栏设计，最左侧是分类目录和管理项，第二栏是项目清单，第三栏则是具体的项目数据和功能服务。新版相较于此前布局更宽松，清扫了一些划分空间的线条，还加入各种彩色小图标，尤其是「新建项…</span>

在 文科博士生眼里的资料管理、阅读和笔记系统 中我介绍了我的笔记系统的搭建，然而在具体的实践中如何进行操作呢？这次我想就阅读和写读书笔记的阶段，分享一下个人的经验。
读书习惯的养成
作为研究者，每天读书写作搞研究就是本职工作了，然而想要维持日复一日地读书写作可并不是个容易的事情。尤其在状态不好时，长时间没有产出时，被研究内容折磨地头秃时……我想如果作为纯粹作为兴趣爱好的读书学习，可能更容易坚持吧，但却可能更难达到更高深度和更大强度。
为什么我们都知道读书学习对我们人生的重大意义，却难以持之以恒呢？《掌控习惯》(Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break, James Clear, 2018) 这本书告诉我们是时候正视作为一个普通人类的好逸恶劳，好易恶难的本性，这样才能通过策略来帮助自己成为自己想成为的人。而这本书中给我们提供一些建议是：设置良好的工作环境，减小任务难度以降低阻力等。
这些建议应该如何运用到读书学习这件事上呢？我的方法是：

将读书学习的任务切分为一两个小时内可以完成的小任务。譬如在内容上将一本书切分成章节，每个章节是一个任务；在过程上切分读书、做笔记、整理复习等步骤，每个步骤是单独的任务。eg：阅读《xx》书 xx 章；整理《xx》书 xx 章笔记；复习并总结《xx》书 xx 章。
根据任务的性质，为每个任务的顺利实施创造良好的环境。
为每个任务分配时间，根据日程为每天分配任务。至少分配并完成一个，对此进行打卡记录，长期坚持形成习…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是沈乐平导演。今天我们《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》正式上线了，今天正好是感恩节，在此首先感恩大家的关注，也和大家做一番交流。很多人关心，我们为什么会在这个时间点推出《秦时明月》的十五周年版？我想说，最主要的原因正是感恩和回馈。
熟悉秦时明月和玄机的观众都知道，这次的秦时明月十五周年版其实已经是秦时明月第一部的第二次重制。百步飞剑到目前已有三个版本。每一次的重制，我们都将其当作对长久支持我们的观众和粉丝的一份礼物和回馈。


其中一个很重要的原因，是我们发现很多月饼不仅自己会经常回顾这部作品，也会向身边的朋友推荐这部曾带给他感动和启发的作品；但确实15年前制作这部动画的技术，从模型的精度甚至到画面的比例，和今天比已不可同日而语。所以这次的秦时明月十五周年版，我们用现在所掌握的最新技术进行了全面优化，以期给大家呈现全新的面貌。通过这些版本的比较，相信大家也能看出玄机在大家支持、鼓励和鞭策下，不断前进，努力做更好的自己。

秦时明月对于玄机的意义是非凡的。应该说玄机在行业中很长一段时间属于比较独特的公司——整整十年时间只做一部作品秦时明月。这一方面是因为行业发展和团队发展的阶段性；但另一方面，通过这样一段时间的沉淀和团队经验累积，我们也更深刻的理解“十年磨一剑”这句话的意义。我们觉得自己很幸运，能够在15周年的时候，有机会和能力再一次重新打磨这部作品。大家可以看到，这部作品相比原来的版本是一个脱胎换骨的升级——从每一个道具、场景的模型，每一个分镜还有动画，包括光影的处理，实际上都是全新的制作。

十五周年版我们内部专门成立了一个极致动画部，主要聚焦动画的表现，如口型、表情、布料物理运算的提升。十五周年版加强的并不是我们已经受肯定较多的场景、建模和光影特效等方面，主要加强的是角色表演的生动性、细腻度和流畅性。这三方面其实不仅仅在角色，更是一个全方位的体现，比如场景，大家可以看…</span>

                    <span>The cool thing about having an entrepreneurial-related podcast is that I get to speak with very knowledgeable people inside the startup and bootstrapping world.
Arvid Kahl is a multi-talented business professional working as an expert software engineer, a successful entrepreneur, and an energetic writer. And here are the 9 lessons I got from our interview:
The audience-first approach is a much more effective way of gaining success in your venture.
It involves finding a niche or a problem prevalent in an existing target market and creating a product for it.
It is imperative that you understand whom you are creating products for, what their critical problems are, and how your product can solve those problems. 
Every bootstrap founder needs to research the market before starting the project.

                    <span>What is JavaScript?


JavaScript, is also known as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
Vanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.
JS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.
JavaScript can be used for the following:
 Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.
 Creating web and mobile applications.
 Building web servers and developing server applications.
 Game Development
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.
 TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.
 TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.
 JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.
 TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn&#x27;t need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.

The benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:
 Supports Class and Modules.
 Static Type-checking
 ES6 Feature Support
 Clear Library API definition.
 Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.
 Superset of JavaScript

As TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.</span>

                    <span>For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There&#x27;s a global crypto object that&#x27;s available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
&quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you&#x27;re on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&quot;crypto&quot;);
randomUUID(); // &quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;

It&#x27;s cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!
You can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.</span>

                    <span>Bit of a late blog this week. I was deep into some coding until late last night, and then got absolutely flattened by my body&#x27;s immune response to the COVID booster I received around lunchtime. I went from fine to feeling sicker than I&#x27;ve been in a long time in the span of about five minutes. I&#x27;m taking a sick day from work today, and with two more days off for the Thanksgiving holiday, I have plenty of time to lay around and recover. Maybe I&#x27;ll get some solid learning in, too!
This past week started with a whimper: some personal frustrations boiled over and I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot done for a couple days. However, some long days on the tail end of the week helped me regain momentum.

                    <span>一年一度的黑色星期五促销已经开始了，各大海外电商纷纷推出了自己的优惠措施，不知道刚刚经历双十一的血雨腥风的你还有多少力气来参战这场购物节。少数派的作者们推荐了一些正在促销的购物平台，为你的海淘提供一些参考。
亚马逊海外购
🔗 网站链接 &gt;
@鹿额：虽然亚马逊中国内地的电商业务在 2019 年已经停止运营，但其中专营跨境电商的海外购业务依然保留了下来。目前，亚马逊海外购的商品品类囊括了服装、计算机、美妆、玩具等等 12 大类，主要由海外的亚马逊美国/英国/日本/德国负责销售并直邮中国内地，并且在「黑色星期五」期间会有不小的折扣。

相比于自己亲自海淘或是进行转运，亚马逊海外购的一大优点便是相对更加省心，因为购物过程中无需顾虑支付和转运上的一些问题。一些经常海淘的朋友可能曾遇到过这样的情况：在某些美国的品牌官网或是电商网站进行购物时，商家出于一些因素的考虑会对由中国大陆发行的信用卡支付的订单、信用卡账单地址与运输地址不一致的订单或是商品运输地址明显为转运仓库地址的订单进行「砍单」处理，从来带来一些不必要的麻烦以及时间成本。

使用亚马逊海外购则无需担心上述问题，亚马逊网站会在商品详情页清楚地标注商品由哪个国家的亚马逊发货，同时在显著的位置标识商品价格、预估进口税费、预计送达日期区间、是否支持无理由退货等信息，下单付款后等待收货即可，除了商品国际运输所花费的时间稍长（通常约为 7-14 天）、售后服务凭订单收据进行外，其他体验与从国内电商平台购物并无太大区别。
值得一提的是，亚马逊海外淘的预估关税采用「多退少不补」的原则，结算时支付的预估关税如果比实际关税高，亚马逊后续会提供退款，结算时支付的预估关税如果少于实际关税，亚马逊则不会再额外要求你补款（至少我们目前没有遇到过这种情况）。
另外如果你是亚马逊的 Prime 会员或者订单金额满 300 元，运费也可以得到豁免。

                    <span>每天睡好觉真的很难做到，除了从自身角度进行身心平衡，解决病理性问题之外，床品体验也非常重要，枕头更是尤为重要。一只好的枕头会给内心带来扎实的安全感，舒服到身心完全释放。想必挑选到合适枕头的人应该都有过这种感受吧，特别是刚刚换上它的第一晚，那种体验上的升华，扑面，啊不，扑颈而来的幸福感，有一种一夜暴富的喜悦感，后悔它没有早点来。
☁️ 挑选枕头的维度
为了满足不同人群对于枕头的不同需要，挑选枕头需要考虑很多方面。市面上真的有很多种枕头供大家选择，完全不用担心找不到买新款可能比不过自己床上的陈年旧枕。比如从枕头的特性来说，有软硬度的差异，枕头高低的不同，丰富的枕头材质同时还能满足更多体验上的需求。除此之外，还有贴心的细节加以辅助，比如添加抗菌成分或者面料更亲肤，透气性好，睡起来不热等。枕头的材质也有很多讲究，有些人对羽毛过敏会选择乳胶枕、软管枕或者记忆枕，有洁癖的人会更倾向于挑选容易清洗的枕头等等。
众所周知，挑选一款适合自己的枕头，要用自己的喜好和身体的真实感受去匹配枕头的基本情况。人的感官不尽相同，也就需要考虑不同枕头能带来的不同特征。
我把枕头的基本特征分成了以下几个维度：

尺寸——正常情况下，至少要比肩膀宽一些。太小的枕头翻身就会超过它，无法支撑颈部，影响睡眠质量和安全感；
高度——根据身材体型（身材胖瘦、肩膀宽窄以及颈椎的生理弧度等），加上自己对高度的习惯挑选，更贴合自己的颈椎曲度和肩颈空间。更合适的枕头应该贴近肩部，和头颈充分接触；
软硬度——主要考虑是否处在自己舒适的感官范围，也可能会影响枕头的支撑度和对头颈肩的包裹力；
支撑度——支撑度对颈椎尤为重要，办公室久坐的朋友或者颈椎已经出现问题的人，都需要额外注意枕头对颈椎的支撑度。支撑度要认真感受枕上后对颈椎的支撑力是否足够，以及是否可以持续提供支撑，不会因为时间和压力改变而塌陷变瘪，失去支撑力。
材质——是需要综…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 11 月 17 日，Apple 宣布了一项新的服务：Self Service Repair（以下简称自助维修）。
根据 Apple 发布的 新闻稿， 该计划将从 2022 年初开始在美国率先启动，并在 2022 年或更晚推广到其他国家。届时，将允许顾客从 Apple Self Service Repair Online Store 上获取 Apple 原装零件与工具，自行修理设备。除此之外，消费者也可以将更换下来的受损零件交给 Apple 进行回收，并且获得一些鼓励性的购买补贴，将自助维修和 Apple 整体的环保计划进行了一次结合。
至于该计划覆盖的设备范围，Apple 称该计划将首先应用于 iPhone 12 与 iPhone 13 系列产品，搭载 M1 芯片的 Mac 电脑也将很快加入。但是另外两条重要的产品线——iPad 和 AirPods 系列并未被提及。（从它们的结构设计和第三方拆解的结果来看，我猜测这是因为 Apple 还不愿放手让顾客自行维修易弯的 iPad 和容易出现奇妙小问题的 AirPods。）
不出意料，消息发布后引起了热烈的关注和讨论。有观点认为，Apple 这项态度上的「大转弯」是在提前应对美国呼声渐响的「维修权」（right to repair）立法趋势，以及监管机构不断增加的压力。
本文不意在对 Apple 此项变化的动机作出推测和评论，而是想从我作为一个维修爱好者的角度，尝试分析这项服务推出后，对于维修市场和个人用户可能造成的影响。
Apple 是怎么把 iPhone 变得越来越难修的？
众所周知，Apple 曾经对于「维修」这件事的态度并不好——准确来讲，是对于「不经过 Apple 的维修」不友好——这件事甚至从上世纪八十年代便已经开始了。 1984 年发布的第一代 Macintosh 电脑是一款极具乔布斯个人色彩的产品，其…</span>

何谓「数字生活」
二十年前，乔布斯在一次日本节目的采访中提到，他认为个人电脑的发展有三个阶段，分别是针对企业的生产力阶段、针对家庭用户的互联网阶段，以及针对个人的数字生活阶段。在最后一个阶段里，个人电脑作为数码相机、手机等一系列电子设备的数字中心，不仅能帮助人们处理数据表格、邮件等工作方面的事宜，还能够帮助所有人用更丰富的方式表现自己。去创作音乐，去拍照片，去剪辑视频，去表达自己独特的情感。这也是乔布斯一直信奉的价值观，即「站在科技和人文的交叉口上」。
二十年过去，他所设想的早已成真。「数字生活」的时代终于到来，没有人可以例外。
说真的，尽管问题重重，我还是很喜欢自己的数字生活。它让我感知到自我的延伸，以一种现实不能达到的方式。诚然，文字本就是主观的描述，音乐、摄影等一切艺术皆然；而被创作出的数字生活，和真实总有不能避免的差距。但就算「看见美好」和「描述美好」是容易产生误解的表达过程，前者依然使后者具备了价值。这也是我对生活的理解：记录，创作，这是热爱的表现。故而，唯有创作，才能沟通理想，抵御虚无。
关注自我是第一步。在此前的文章里，我介绍了许多记录自我的方法：比如 用 Notion 记下吃过的每一顿饭、构建自己的观影评分体系、用设计软件画下居住过的房间、建立桌面产品收纳的系统 等。这一次，我想做点略超出「自我」范畴外的：为陪伴我的猫猫小耳朵建立一个数字生活中心。

                    <span>松露，是个很无厘头的汉语译名。


顾名思义，它被比喻为松树凝出的露水。但这种生长在地下的真菌，既不在松树枝干上生长，也不依附松针松根形成的自然生态。橡树、榛树、椴树、榉树、桦树、松树、白杨都可以成为松露的生存环境。松树与松露，从没有必然联系。


事实上，直到上世纪80年代，松露在中国的名字依然充满了下里巴人的气息，“土茯苓”“无娘果”“猪拱菌”“臭鸡枞”……松露两字，最早出现在改革开放后的欧美文学译作里。


也许在中国的翻译家眼中，最珍贵最美味的食用真菌，天然就应该与松树搭上关系，比如松茸、松树蕈、松蘑、松耳；而露珠本身，则与可食用真菌一样，隐含着无根无蒂、无体无形，采纳天地灵气和日月精华而生的意蕴。


一个美丽的名词，从诞生之初，就夹带着狗血的误会。







No.1 壹


作为一种食物，Truffle准确的译名不是松露，而是“块菌”。从生物学的分类来看，块菌与羊肚菌的亲缘关系很接近，整个欧亚大陆和北美大陆各地，都能出产这种生长在土壤下的真菌。它是一种典型的世界性生物。


但东西方对它的态度，却有着天壤之别。西方有着悠久的松露食用史，4000年前，生活在两河流域的苏美尔人，就用楔形文字记载了一个孩子将这种食物献给国王的故事。而到了公元1世纪的古罗马时代，美食家阿比西斯在他的传世名作《厨艺》中，已经详细介绍了松露的吃法：煮熟后串起来，加盐烘烤出焦香；另将葡萄酒、橄榄油、胡椒、蜂蜜、鱼酱和酸葡萄汁一起煮沸，加入淀粉后做成蘸酱；最后在松露上用针刺出小孔，泡进蘸酱里吸取味道。


即便到了今天，人工培植相对困难，主要靠野外采集的松露，依然是餐桌上的珍品。但在2000年前，古罗马人已经实现了松露的常态化食用。一方面，贵族的奢靡生活，反映了古代欧洲封建国家的富庶和强大；另一方面，也证明了欧洲人珍视松露的饮食传统。







在中国，松露的应用就落后很多。上下五千…</span>

Synopsis: Set in modern-day America, Bel-Air is a serialized one-hour dramatic analogue of the 90’s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” that leans into the original premise: Will’s complicated journey from the streets of West Philadelphia to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.

This Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / tiktok / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.16.4, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.16.5 in 2021!

The goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, camman18 from twitch / tiktok / twitter , playing Minecraft Java 1.16.5 and not Minecraft Bedrock.

THIS IS THE GREATEST CLIP EVER!!!!!</span>

                    <span>What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in react?


To put simply, controlled components have their data being handled with a react component whereas an uncontrolled component&#x27;s data is being handled with the DOM itself. Let&#x27;s dig into this answer a bit more though starting at the basics and including a few visual examples. 
Form elements are rendered with HTML within React components where data is being accessed and manipulate. When we are discussing uncontrolled and controlled components these are terms that are specifically discussing the way in which the form created is handling and accessing that said data. The data handling can be done a few different ways but is commonly seen using typed elements like,  and  or selected elements such as…</span>

                    <span>Overview:


Machine Learning (ML) and data science applications are in high demand. When ML algorithms offer information before it is known, the benefits for business are significant. Integrating machine learning algorithms for inference into production systems is a technological barrier hence the need for deploying ML models as API&#x27;S. 
In this short article, we implement AI based models to detect COVID-19 in Chest X-rays and CT Scans using four Deep Learning Algorithms: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception. Note, we shall focus mainly on implementing the api and not the model creation. 
To test my live endpoint, send a POST request to the following URL with an x-ray image appended to the body of the request. You will get the following sample output if request was successful:

                    <span>Article by Jay Allen
Learning AWS is complicated enough. But learning AWS is made more challenging when you&#x27;re also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. 
In simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. 
Stacks can be stood up manually. However, it&#x27;s better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…</span>

Slate.js is a highly customizable platform for creating rich-text editors, also known as WYSIWYG editors. It enables you to create powerful, intuitive editors similar to those you’ve probably used in Medium, Dropbox Paper, or Google Docs. These are quickly becoming standard features for many web apps, and tools like Slate make them easier to implement, ensuring your program won’t get bogged down in complexity.
Although Slate is still in beta at the time of writing, it’s natural to ask whether it has the potential to replace more mature platforms like Quill and Draft.js. The short answer is that it&#x27;s far too early to tell, but here are a few facts to support why it could.

Introduction
What are SHAP values?
Walkthrough example
How does Mage explain models?
Conclusion
Machine learning models are usually seen as a “black box.” It takes some features as input and produces some predictions as output. The common questions after model training are:
How do different features affect the prediction results?
What are the top features that influence the prediction results?
The model performance metrics look great, but should I trust the results?
Whatever you say Prince Ali (Source: Giphy)


Thus, model explainability plays an important role in the machine learning world. Model insights are useful for the following reasons:

Informing feature engineering
Directing future data collection
Informing human decision-making

                    <span>So, you&#x27;ve spent hours, weeks, or even months on a project you believe in, and you are damn proud of it. It is capable of solving problems every developer faces, the test coverage is about 110%, and the code itself is just shy of a work of art. But then, as you push your last commit, you remember that, lurking in the shadows of your IDE, was a holdup most developers underestimate: documentation.
Ok, maybe it is not as scary as I make it sound, but still something you should respect, after all, every programmer has, at some point in their life, come across a poorly documented library or package, spent a few minutes of guesswork trying to make it work, maybe even tried reading a bit of the source code, just to finally give up on using it. Turns out, most of the time, an undocumented applicat…</span>

                    <span>Ready? Round 2! ❤️
Hi! Remember when in the previous post I told you what HTML was, what it looked like and what the attributes were? well, it&#x27;s time to start playing with it. So grab paper and pencil and let&#x27;s get started! 
Ok, we know that the tags look like this:
    
 ....... some content .....
 as . 
Tags are generally always lowercase. 
We must close the tags so that they always work.
Well this is the basic structure :

         
            
Hello World    
                  
               …</span>

                    <span>Have you ever googled something, no matter what it is, a recipe, a meme or even a school assignment, and prayed that the answer would show up on a web page? I have too, and that&#x27;s why on more than one occasion I&#x27;ve wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.
Okay! to start with this:
HTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it &quot;programming language&quot; should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a &quot;markup language&quot; because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.
As I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :
content

However this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :


But that&#x27;s not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like &quot;upgrades&quot; of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.
content.

It seems interesting, doesn&#x27;t it? Well, don&#x27;t worry, in the next posts I&#x27;ll be telling you a little more so you won&#x27;t be left wanting. See you in the next one ! and remember to do what you love every day.</span>

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第5天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
🔥 一、组件化
作为一个单工程撸到底的开发人员，想试着将项目进行组件化改造，说动就动。毕竟技术都是写出来的，看着文章感觉懂了，但是实际开发中还是能遇到各种各样的问题，开始搞起来。
💥 1.1 为什么使用组件化
一直使用单工程撸到底，项目越来越大导致出现了不少的问题：
查找问题慢：定位问题，需要在多个代码混合的模块中寻找和跳转。
开发维护成本增加：避免代码的改动影响其它业务的功能，导致开发和维护成本不断增加。
编译时间长：项目工程越大，编译完整代码所花费的时间越长。
开发效率低：多人协作开发时，开发风格不一，又很难将业务完全分割，大家互相影响，导致开发效率低下。
代码复用性差：写过的代码很难抽离出来再次利用。
💥 1.2 模块化与组件化
🌀 1.2.1 模块
将一个程序按照其功能做拆分，分成相互独立的模块，以便于每个模块只包含与其功能相关的内容，比如登录模块、首页模块等等。
🌀 1.2.2 组件
组件指的是单一的功能组件，如登录组件、视频组件、支付组件 等，每个组件都可以以一个单独的 module 开发，并且可以单独抽出来作为 SDK 对外发布使用。可以说往往一个模块包含了一个或多个组件。
💥 1.3 组件化的优势
组件化基于可重用的目的，将应用拆分成多个独立组件，以减少耦合:
加快编译速度：每个业务功能都是一个单独的工程，可独立编译运行，拆分后代码量较少，编译自然变快。
解耦：通过关注点分离的形式，将App分离成多个模块，每个模块都是一个组件。
提高开发效率：多人开发中，每个组件模块由单人负责，降低了开发之间沟通的成本，减少因代码风格不一而产生的相互影响。
代码复用：类似我们引用的第三方库，可以将基础组件…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(0 min)</span>
                    <span>疑问的开端
大家有没有想过一个问题：在浏览器里打开某个网页，网页上有一个按钮点击可以唤起App。

这样的效果是怎么实现的呢？浏览器是一个app；为什么一个app可以调起其他app的页面？
说到跨app的页面调用，大家是不是能够想到一个机制：Activity的隐式调用？
一、隐式启动原理
当我们有需要调起其他app的页面时，使用的API就是隐式调用。
比如我们有一个app声明了这样的Activity：

    
        
        
    


其他App想启动上边这个Activity如下的调用就好：
val intent &#x3D; Intent()
intent.action &#x3D; &quot;mdove&quot;
startActivity(intent)

我们没有主动声明Activity的class，那么系统是怎么为我们找到对应的Activity的呢？其实这里和正常的Activity启动流程是一样的，无非是if / else的实现不同而已。
接下来咱们就回顾一下Activity的启动流程，为了避免陷入细节，这里只展开和大家相对“耳熟能详”的类和调用栈，以串流程为主。
1.1、跨进程
首先我们必须明确一点：无论是隐式启动还是显示启动；无论是启动App内Activity还是启动App外的Activity都是跨进程的。比如我们上述的例子，一个App想要启动另一个App的页面。
注意没有root的手机，是看不到系统孵化出来的进程的。也就是我们常见的为什么有些代码打不上断点。

追过startActivity()的同学，应该很熟悉下边这个调用流程，跟进几个方法之后就发现进到了一个叫做ActivityTread的类里边。
ActivityTread这个类有什么特点？有main函数，就是我们的主线程。
很快我们能看到一个比较常见类的调用：Instrumentation：
// Activ…</span>

前言：有做过完整项目的小伙伴应该都知道，随着业务的发展，app的运营需求会越来越多（比如：根据运营活动动态更换页面的UI）。这就要求我们的app要尽可能的满足市场的运营的动态化需求，通过这篇文章你将了解到：
1. Flutter动态化的方案使用和效果对比；
2. 针对中小型团队，该如何最小成本、最高效的实现app的动态化需求。
动态化的常用方式和实现原理
首先什么是动态化？即不依赖程序安装包，就能进行动态实时更新页面的技术。
一般大家都会想到webview，这确实是最常用的方式，但也是动态化中最不稳定的方式；webview的体验比较差，同时需要做大量设备的兼容。
基于 GPL 的 Native 增强。 GPL即通用编程语言，比如我们常见的Dart、JavaScript等，通过这些通用语言来为Native功能增强动态化能力。通俗的举个例子解释：运营者动态更改线上的js文件，Flutter应用通过网络拉取更新后动态渲染，这就是基于GPL的Native增强。
基于 DSL 的 Native 增强。 DSL即专用领域语言，为了解决某些特定场景下的任务而专门设计的语言,比如xml、json、css、html。通过生成简单的DSL语言文件，通过解析协议对页面进行动态配置。
腾讯开源的 MXFlutter
58同城开源的 Flutter Fair
阿里巴巴开源的 北海Kraken
同时我还会介绍另外两种比较通用的方式：
webview增强 【植入腾讯 X5内核，模型升级改造】
UI库模板化
各大厂动态化架构对比

Flutter Fair
Fair是“58同城”为Flutter设计的动态化框架，通过Fair Compiler工具实现JSON配置和原生Dart源文件的自动转化，从而动态更新Widget Tree和State。

                    <span>因为官方deepl插件太多不方便的地方，因此在论坛东拼西凑搞出了个目前比较满意的修改版本。
目前google版本只有iphone使用时才是最新版本翻译，ipad版本因为marginnote本身的webview的user agent 设定依然停留在ios13.3，因此翻译结果会非常残破（旧版google翻译）。 希望能用上新版google翻译的大家就请跟我一起向官方反应这个状况吧，这个插件是解决不了的。

                    <span>今年的十一假期期间我没有继续宅在家里，而是选择打破两点一线的工作日生活，去探寻不一样的城市和自然美景——当然除了感受异地的人文风景之外，我还有另外一个目的：作为「村长」，为了更好地建设村落而积累更多的「步数」。
这或许是我第一次因为一款游戏而「运动」。

一个用「步数」建成的「猫猫村」
比起那些需要不断氪金或者让你看广告的手游，我更喜欢《猫猫村》这种「无负担」的「健康手游」——没有虚拟世界里的激烈竞争，也没有让我沉迷到不可自拔的关卡，整个游戏玩下来的感觉只有一个：原来只要健康生活就可以满足你所建设的这个《猫猫村》中村民们的需求，让这些可爱的「像素猫」可以开心愉悦地生活。

而如何建设你的猫猫村？答案就在自己脚下——尽力地在现实世界中坚持运动来获得步数，就可以用来在游戏中建设房屋、道具、家具等，并以此让猫猫村中村民生活得更惬意，而村民们如果对当前的生活感到满意就会产生「爱心」：这同样也是一种重要的建设资源，随着爱心获取越多，你可以一步步地解锁更高级的建筑以及道具，从而让你的村落设施更全面，进一步地扩大村落吸引更多的村民入住。

我不知道这样以运动步数作为游戏中重要资源的设计是否更符合现代年轻人的「佛系生活方式」，但不得不说《猫猫村》让我们每天的步数有了更多的使用场景，使得每天的运动可能不再仅仅是蚂蚁森林中新增的绿地、微信运动中每日的步数排行榜，或者是 Apple Watch 获得的运动成就徽章……

这款游戏为那些看似日常的运动赋予了一种新的使命感——让自己的努力为游戏中的「他们」带来美好的生活，这又何不是另一种类型的自我心灵疗愈？
像素画风下的温馨小村
不仅仅是游戏要素，从画面上《猫猫村》就完全有别于我玩过的任何一款游戏，甚至你可能会觉得它无论在画面上还是设置方面都显得有些「简陋」——八位像素风格的画面，整个场景设计成了横板卷轴，因而整个村落的建设完全是在一个 2D 的平面中进行铺设，甚至在建设玩法上实际更像是在一个线上依次摆设——既不能调整建筑的大小，也不能调整建筑或者家具的位置。

当然对于喜欢像素风游戏的朋友而言，《猫猫村》又是很独特的，类似早年八位机游戏的文本互动方式在现在看来，显得是那么地复古与时尚。

这种画面上的简单让你不由得会想到早年的像素风游戏甚至是那些横板过关的游戏——因此游戏的发展进行或者是场景的解锁都是向两侧进行，比如你可以根据猫猫村民 NPC的提示来扩展村落边界，或者是通过建设不同的建筑来创建更多的子场景，而这些分散的子场景让游戏随着时间推进一步步地变得更加丰富有趣。

每天就玩十分钟：真的不能再多了！
如果你每天都抽出时间玩上一会儿《猫猫村》，你可能会觉得他是你见过的最「佛系」、最不会让人上瘾的游戏了。

游戏中的玩法其实非常简单，你需要带领一群像素猫猫建立一个自己的村庄，而最初的生产资料就是你每日的步数，我们需要使用步数来兑换最为基础的建筑，比如水井、树等等，通过和猫猫们的共同努力来建设村落中的第一栋房屋。

随着游戏的进行，猫猫们在村落生活的同时开始产生大量的「❤️」，同样作为生产资料，你可以使用「❤️」来安装抵御偷心贼的武器，也可以用来兑换一系列的新建筑，而猫猫 NPC 也会随着时间推移给出相应的建设请求，并一步步地提醒你建设新的建筑与设施。

当你真正上手之后就会发现，实际上整个《猫猫村》的节奏并不快，相比那些几个小时就开始提醒你继续建设的放置类手游，《猫猫村》的平均游玩时间可以说非常短，而我每一次的游戏时间也在十几分钟左右，在完成 NPC 给的小任务之后往往更多的是点触村民猫猫来进行互动。

随着游戏的进行，你可以建造的建筑以及家具就会又来越多，这些建筑物或者家具其实也暗藏玄机，比如你可以使用幸运转盘进行抽奖，甚至你可以通过将记事板放到房间里，并使用密码锁给房间上锁，在猫猫村中撰写你的「私密日记」。

结语
在上手《猫猫村》之后，我带上村民回到了自己生活的城市，回到了那些用钢铁水泥构筑的森林和那封闭的格子间，好在手机的那一头还有一些用像素构成的小猫在等着我，等着我在疲累的工作之余，和他们简单地来一次互相治愈的游戏。

                    <span>比起早年的功能的增加和设计语言的迭代，这两年的 iOS 更新显然更具有时代的印记 —— 疫情时代下（尤其是 Apple 所在的美国），无法预知的明天和不能见面的彼此，要怎样才能继续保持真切的沟通和高效的工作？经过一年的思考，Apple 终于在 iOS 15 的更新概览页面给出了答案 ——「更有聊，更专注」这六个大字，已经定下了整个 iOS 15 更新的基调。

更有聊，自然指的是同播共享和 FaceTime、信息中的各种分享功能；而更专注，自然就是下面要详细聊到的「专注模式」了。
实际案例
相信大部分读者都已经不止一次地看过专注模式的详解，但这些「详解」往往显得有些不够「接地气」，普通用户看完也很难创建属于自己的专注模式。
下面我们就结合实际的案例，来具体分析都用到了哪些操作。更重要的是，这些案例希望能对你设定自己的专注模式提供思路，起到一个抛砖引玉的作用。
写稿模式
作为一个自由撰稿人，写稿几乎已经成为了生活中最日常的事情，而它正好也需要我长时间保持状态，所以为它创建一个专注模式是再合适不过了。
首先，我们进入专注模式的页面，点击右上角创建一个新的专注类型。系统本身会为你建议几种专注模式，不过这里我们就直接选择自定。命名并做好个性化操作之后，点击下一步就可以正式进入详细的设置选项。
一般来说，电话和信息已经不是我的主要联系方式，因此我只给家人添加到了允许列表中，其它的都选择了不允许。当然，为了能让他人在真的有急事时能联系到我，我也会打开允许重复来电的选项。

接下来是设定允许通知的 App。毕竟是个需要长时间集中精力的活，写稿模式下的通知提醒自然是越少越好。因此诸如微信、微博、Instagram 这类社交应用自然是排除在外的，仅仅允许一些较重要的 App 和时效性的通知推送。值得一提的是，这里面的 App 其实不仅包括了 iPhone、iPad App，还包括了 Appl…</span>

                    <span>为期一周的 Adobe MAX 2021 创意大会 已落下帷幕。同往年一样，由于疫情，本次大会转为线上举办，而大会的重头戏无疑是 Adobe Sensei 为 Creative Cloud apps 提供的大量新功能，利用人工智能，简化用户的操作，把用户从一些重复、繁杂的工作中解放出来，从而激发他们的创造力与想象力。

注：

文中提及的 Lightroom、Photoshop、After Effects、Premiere Pro，以及其它 Creative Cloud apps，其新功能已上线正式版，订阅用户可在 Creative Cloud 中更新；
文中的 Gif 图片有做加速处理，具体处理时间会因电脑配置有所差异。

Lightroom &amp; LrC
新的蒙版面板
在 Lightroom 2022 的蒙版面板中，除原有的「画笔、径向滤镜、渐变滤镜」，新增了「选择主体、选择天空、颜色范围、明亮度范围、深度范围」五个蒙版工具，相信大家对「选择主体」并不陌生，在 Photoshop CC 中，借助由 Adobe Sensei 驱动的选择主体（Select Subject）功能，可以轻松地选中图像中的物体，此次 Adobe 将这一功能下放至 Lightroom 与 Lightroom Classic 终于肯将牙膏挤给 Lightroom，进一步提高摄影后期的工作效率。
Lightroom：新蒙版面板
选择主体功能
在 Lightroom 2021 及以往版本，如果需要对照片中的某一物体进行分区处理，只有两种方法 —— 导出 DNG 后导入到 Photoshop 处理，或者是「手搓蒙版」。遇到复杂物体时，真的是要「笑嘻嘻」了。
当用户更新至 Lightroom 2022 后，可根据需要选择照片中的主体、天空，以及根据明亮度、颜色进行抠像处理。

但凡能摆个桌子有点地方，大家都有把东西收拾收拾弄个漂亮桌面的想法。但理想总是很丰满， 现实一直很骨感，大部分人对于怎么收拾桌子根本就无从下手。笔者根据自己的布置经验，来给大家说说要注意的几个点。

01 桌面结构拓扑
设备拓扑还请见图，具体内容在下面的小节中展开。

02 理线与思路
俗话说得好：简约风格靠藏，极简风格靠扔。设备众多，自然各种设备的线缆缠在一块就堪比盘丝洞了。桌面的布置，不管是有线还是无线化，需要注意的都是把线捋好顺下去。一堆不同粗细和外皮材质的线在桌面上盘根错节，那可太难看了。那自然，整洁的第一步自然是把桌面的线缆都尽量放在桌后/下。

不过线缆本身就有长度和重量，很多设备还需要适配器，光用线自己坠着肯定会一股脑全掉下来。这个时候这种桌下理线槽的作用就体现出来了：适配器直接放在架子上，一些软质线材绑好后放在架子上，硬质线材就卷在架子上面，这样布置好就不会乱糟糟一团了。只要足够长，就不存在放不下的情况。

另外关于供电：一个是插座的插孔一定要互不干涉，方便尽量全部都能安排上；二是也要放在桌后/下不在视野内出现。符合这样要求的自然就是 PDU 插座了。像是升降桌这种有有横承桌子，就可以用扎带直接绑住 PDU 两边的耳朵固定。

那么从桌下转到桌上。现在显示器是明基 EW3270U，日常使用情况下是要接入三根线的：一根电源线，一根 HDMI 线和一根 Type-C 线，分别用于供电和设备连接。如果直接使用显示器自身的支架和木制增高架的话，建议将线捋好后用扎带绑紧，再由后部垂下以达到藏线的效果。而是用悬臂支架就省事了，只…</span>

Lyrics:
Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies yeah
I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her maybe
Did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain’t it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits
And ain’t it funny
How you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don’t look like it

Allows you to transform JSON data into an object whose members can be queried using the member access operator. Unlike json.dumps in the standard library that returns a dictionary object, this library returns a JSONObjectMapper object. The attributes of these objects are defined by the contents of the JSON data provided to it
It can be installed using pip 
pip install json2obj
https://github.com/trumpowen/json2obj

import datetime
from json2obj import JSONObjectMapper 

person &#x3D; JSONObjectMapper(&quot;&quot;&quot;{ &quot;name&quot; : &quot;trumpowen&quot; , &quot;age&quot; : 125 }&quot;&quot;&quot;) 
person.name &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;trumpowen&quot; # true
person.age &#x3D;&#x3D; 125 # true 
# replaces and overwrites 
person.name &#x3D; {} 
person.name.first_name &#x3D; &quot;Wilkins&quot; 
person.name.last_name &#x3D; &quot;Owen&quot; 
person.name.other_names &#x3D; [&quot;Trump&quot;]

# add new attribute. If this is not desired, you can initialize the object with readonly set to True. This will prevent the addition of new attributes and changing the values of existing attributes 
person.dob &#x3D; datetime(1900, 12, 6) 
json_data &#x3D; str(person) # returns a string representation 
json_as_dict &#x3D; person.to_dict() # returns a dictionary representation 

Use help(obj) , where obj is an instance of JSONObjectMapper</span>

                    <span>Diariamente o ser humano vem procurando e criando meios para acelerar a evolução, e aqui eu vou passar um pouco de 3 pilares que eu tenho utilizado evoluir cada vez no meu desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional.
A falta de foco e uma das piores pedras no caminho dos devs quando se trata de evolução, o grande leque de tecnologias que surgem diariamente faz com que muitos devs(principalmente os iniciantes) não tenham um foco especifico em uma stack e isso acaba atrapalhando a evolução de muita gente.
Não se trata qual e a melhor tecnologia, se trata de qual tecnologia você e melhor desenvolvendo.
Mantenha sua atenção no que você esta estudando no momento.
ouvir uma frase uma vez que falava que longevidade &gt; intensidade
E para você evoluir com tecnologia que você escolheu não basta só ter foco se você não exercita, e necessário MUITA PRATICA, e a pratica que acelera o seu desenvolvimento.
Programação e uma disciplina pratica, e ela que vai te da toda bagagem e experiência para vencer os desafios que você enfrenta no seu dia a dia e te transforma e um profissional muito mais capacitado no mercado.
A teoria só funciona quando você sabe quando e onde aplicar.
A sensação de esta apenas copiando código e super normal para quem ta começando, mas a repetição se transforma em repertorio e todo o código começa a fazer sentido
Ter pessoas ao seu lado, vivendo o mesmo contexto que você e o melhor combustível que um dev pode receber, o aprendizado compartilhado e a troca de experiências faz a sua evolução se tornar mais leve e divertida.
Quem nunca teve um bug que não resolvia a dias e um amigo ajudou a resolver. Esta ao lado de devs mais experientes faz com que você esteja sempre atualizado com as melhores praticas e tecnologias do mercado

                    <span>These are some rules that I have lazily picked up over the past four years of professional development on angular.
I generally work on small to medium projects without the time to integrate a formal state management system.
It is for this reason that there are data services that try to solve the problem of carrying communication around. If anyone has any further questions or curiosities regarding these points feel free to leave a comment.
methods must be extracted into functions until nothing can be extracted anymore
the component logic shold refer only to local resources of the component as much as possible
dataservices deal with data I/O with the server
the business Logic must live within the dataservice and all components should be of assistance to the business Logic, visualization assistance and small local logics to visualize and modify data
components (internal to the feature internal to the root component) must implement the root dataservice or receive data as input (observables are strongly preferred)
avoid multi-level handovers through inputs, it slows you down and makes refactoring a hassle
if the data as input changed hands more than twice use a dataservice,
each feature must have its own module and declare components related only to that feature
putting the general dataservice next to the feature module is the best way to indicate the root from which to start exploring the code
the beginning of the end of the data flow must take place within the dataservice

the substrate cache-services for API calls must live in the provide of the feature module they belong to and refer to
components  can be interaction contexts between dataservices but services are preferred when possible
interaction services can be interaction contexts between dataservices</span>

                    <span>Esse exercício recebe dois inputs iniciais: um integer N, relativo à quantidade de números em um array, e um integer M, relativo a um subarray deslocável que fará a &quot;varredura&quot; dentro do array principal.

N &#x3D; quantidade de números do array
Dessa forma, os arrays estruturados com M &#x3D; 3 serão:
[5, 3, 5]
Como todos os subarrays precisam ter M números, nesse caso esses serão os subarrays possíveis.
Depois disso, precisamos que o programa contabilize qual é o máximo de números únicos existentes em um subarray de tamanho M.
[5, 3, 5] &#x3D; 2 números únicos
Sendo assim, o máximo de números únicos em um subarray será 3. Esse precisa ser o output.

So here I would like to share with you my favorite image and video placeholder Place Corgi. As you can guess I am a Corgi lover and this image placeholder is just perfect for me, and everyone who loves dogs and especially Corgis.
It is easy to use, just a link to Place Corgi site with a width and optional height specified after the URL.
http://placecorgi.com/width/height
Also, we can place a video as a placeholder. To do that, we would add /v to the URL along with width and height
http://placecorgi.com/v/width/height
You can add the Place Corgi js file to your application, which will automatically replace any img tags that have the class corgi with images from Place Corgi.

                    <span>Introduction


Have you ever wondered how search engines like Google, fetch data from different parts of the web and serve it to you as a user, based on your query? The method used by applications like this is termed crawling. 
Search engines work and by crawling and indexing billions of web pages using different web crawlers called web spiders or search engine bots. What these web spiders do is follow links from each web page that have been indexed to discover new ages.
In this short article, you will be building out your own web crawler using Python and its popular web framework for extracting the data you need from websites.
Also, in this tutorial, developers tend to be confused with web crawling and web scraping. We would learn the difference between these two concepts and examine some…</span>

                    <span>The Prometheus.yml:
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label &#x60;job&#x3D;&#x60; to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: &#x27;prometheus&#x27;

    # metrics_path defaults to &#x27;/metrics&#x27;
    # scheme defaults to &#x27;http&#x27;.

    static_configs:
      - targets: [&#x27;localhost:9090&#x27;]

  - job_name: &#x27;node-exporter&#x27;

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - :9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net&#x3D;&quot;host&quot; --pid&#x3D;&quot;host&quot;  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot;  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs&#x3D;/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type&#x3D;bind,source&#x3D;/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination&#x3D;/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published&#x3D;9090,target&#x3D;9090,protocol&#x3D;tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.</span>

Cloud computing has boomed in the last decade and cloud adoption is at the top of every tech exec’s to do list. More and more companies are considering migrating to the cloud, but what does cloud migration mean, what does the process involve, and what are the benefits and challenges? In this article we will cover this topic and explain how Gennovacap can help your company with cloud migration services.

                    <span>Imagine you have a large set of news articles, and want to provide a way to allow your users to search through them. For example, here are 5 random articles from the Economist:
An investment bonanza is coming
Who governs a country’s airspace?
What is a supermoon, and how noticeable is it to the naked eye?
What the evidence says about police body-cameras
Who controls Syria?
Let’s think about what kind of queries potential users issue and the articles that we would want to return.
A search for “investment” should return the 1st article.
A search for “supermoon” should return the 3rd article.
A search for “syria” should return the 5th article.
This is quite simple to implement with traditional information retrieval techniques, since these queries have keyword matching.

It&#x27;s adopted to asp.net core server implementation (Hot Chocolate) and it&#x27;s a glimpse of how it might look and be used in your next GraphQL application.
Mostly, the mentioned article is about separating &quot;errors&quot; into categories:
errors (e.g. Internal Server Error)
results (Deleted User, Unavailable in Country)
Later on, it encourages to use union types for response modeling. It also highlights the pros of this approach and shows the cons of using the default approach.
GraphQL errors mostly look like this one.

Let&#x27;s start with something easier. The next cases will help us to understand the concept of infer. Ok, look at the piece of code:
let a &#x3D; 10;

TypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it&#x27;s a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it. By the way, where will be another type in case of const usage. Try it by yourself. I&#x27;m waiting for your explanation in the comments. This is a small interactive with a reader)
Ok, we&#x27;ve just found out, TypeScript is pretty smart. If a value corresponds to a specific condition, TS can make a decision about its type. Somethi…</span>

When people visit your webpage, they don&#x27;t want to wait for 10 minutes until the page (and all the images) load.

                    <span>Interviews are always a nerve-wracking thing to do! You spend hours upon hours studying Data Structures and Algorithms, Youtube top programming interview questions and answers, and think of all of the possible questions the interviewer can ask you. 
Thanks to Flatiron School, I was able to prepare for a mock interview to go through these same trials and tribulations as my peers. I am writing this blog post to encourage my fellow aspiring software developers to take every interview opportunity that you can, because just like programming, practice makes perfect. Here is how my mock interview went.
1) The Meet - n - Greet 
2) Technical Q&amp;A

During the technical Q&amp;A portion of my interview, I was asked a handful of React questions. Here were some of the questions that I was asked:

                    <span>Let me describe my coding journey to build a Social Proof component from Frontend Mentors. Frontend Mentors is a online platform that provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs.
The goal is to build this:

The first coding hurdle was setting up the HTML &amp; CSS to create the initial layout and then testing if it flowed decently between mobile and desktop as intended. 
My first decision was deciding between CSS Grid, Flexbox, or a combination of the two. Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool
My tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas.

Screen-shot of the Layout

The next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.
Screen shot of app in development, no styling

Now for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. 
The one thing I didn&#x27;t know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time.

You can play with the solution here
I learned how to add multiple background images at one time. 
I was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: 
Design a responsive layout
Build a foundation with HTML
Add content
Style with CSS, section by section
End with functionality (JavaScript &amp; CSS animation/transitions)
This &quot;Ground up&quot; methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra &quot;Slow is Fast&quot;.

                    <span>What do I do?


We often see technical blog posts from experienced developers sharing their insights from years of coding, hardly ever from someone just starting out. The hardest part of beginning a project is actually imagining a project to start, at least for me. So, I sought inspiration from the internet. (codecademy&#x27;s final project)
Codecademy&#x27;s Final Project in python was to create some terminal program. This was my first project completely from scratch. Of the options at codecademy I decided on the blackjack game. Making a blackjack game seemed fairly challenging but within my grasp. So I got to work. BTW, you can find the source code here
I began by establishing what I would actually need to play blackjack in real life. That being a deck of cards and some people to play with. I didn…</span>

  level of challenge 4/10


A string is a palindrome when it is the same 
For example:
Write a function named palindrome that takes a single string as its parameter.
def palindrome(string):
    pal_string &#x3D; list( string.casefold() )
    rev_string &#x3D; list( reversed(pal_string) )

    if pal_string &#x3D;&#x3D; rev_string:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(palindrome(&quot;aba&quot;))

def palindrome(string):
    while len(string) &gt; 1:
      head &#x3D; string[0]
      tail &#x3D; string[-1]
      string &#x3D; string[1:-1]
      if head !&#x3D; tail:
        return False
    return True

def palindrome(string):
  if len(string) &lt; 2:
    return True
  return string[0] &#x3D;&#x3D; string[-1] and palindrome(string[1:-1])

def palindrome(string):
  return string &#x3D;&#x3D; string[::-1]

Let’s make a query for a temperature api using javascript fetch
First let’s create the interface, we’ll do something simple, using just HTML.

  
  


To present the data we have a div with two spans, one to represent the city and the other to represent the temperature.

I didn&#x27;t want to make the previous post too long, so I didn&#x27;t touch the multistage builds. Here is the post where I will show you how to improve the Dockerfile even more, using multistage builds. Using stages in your builds is not hard to use, but there are some things where the below knowledge may help you 😃

                    <span>Olá!
Este é mais um post da seção Design, e nele vamos tratar de um pattern bastante útil em cenários com múltiplas condições, o Chain of Responsibility (CoR, ou Cadeia de Responsabilidade, em tradução livre). Veremos também como integrá-lo ao container de injeção de dependência do ASP.Net Core.
Vamos lá!
Antes de mais nada, precisamos entender qual a utilidade do pattern, ou seja, qual problema ele resolve. Patterns são soluções cabíveis para um dado tipo de problema, e com o CoR não é diferente.
Imagine um cenário onde, para atender a uma dada requisição (ou comando) a satisfação de diversas condições seja necessária e que, para cada condição, pode haver um dado processamento específico a ser realizado ou um tipo de resultado a ser retornado.
Soa estranho? Explico.

不容错过的新 App
虽然少数派一直在为大家发发现和介绍各平台上的优质 App，但仍有不少设计、功能、交互、体验都非常优秀的 App，还没有被我们发掘和介绍。它们可能是一款老 App，也可能是近期上架的新 App，我们会在这里介绍给你。
Quit All：在 Mac 上一键退出应用程序

平台：macOS
关键词：应用管理、活动监视、后台管理

@huhuhang：在使用 Mac 处理工作时，往往需要打开非常多的应用，但同时也会拖慢系统性能。此外，像我这样有一些「强迫症」的人，总是喜欢把暂时不用的应用一一手动退出。

Quit All 这款主打应用退出痛点的小工具非常实用，你可以把它理解成 Mac 自带「活动监视器」的易用版本。它支持从菜单栏非常方便地退出当前正在运行的应用，或者「一键退出」全部应用。同时，Quit All 提供了过滤后台应用、不弹出退出确认框等个性化选项。一键退出不仅可以满足强迫症，还能够有下班仪式感，每天下班时我都会执行 Quit All。

除了 Quit All，顺带推荐一下应用退出小工具 Quitter。Quitter 和知名播客客户端 Overcast 是同一个开发者。Quitter 主打定时退出，对于处于未激活状态的应用，你可以设置自动退出倒计时。Quitter 对于低频应用特别实用，避免我们忘记手动退出。有了 Quit All 和 Quitter 的完美搭配，退出应用变得无比轻松。

                    <span>10 月的某天，我家楼下的布告栏贴了一张通知，告知住户 10 月 18 日小区要停电一天。虽然此前这种事情也曾发生过，但是也就是停一会儿而已，所以我也就没拿当回事。然而，这次停电持续了将近一整天，在我黑灯瞎火地做饭的时候，我真真切切地感受到电已经渗透到生活的方方面面，没有电是万万不能的（事后了解到，这次是涉及小区供电的一个变压器调整）。这次停电的「阴影」之大，直接唤醒了我儿时的停电记忆。
曾经的停电记忆
在《沿海地区的山珍漫游指南：盘点家乡那些奇怪的美食》一文中，我曾简要地介绍过我老家的一些情况。在细聊限电应对措施之前，我想先聊聊我小时候见过、用过的那些「原始」的应对停电的方案。
因为电力紧张（或者村民们拖欠电费），我儿时经常会遇到停电。每当停电的时候，我经常会点起火油（煤油）灯，火油的那股味道挥之不去。除了火油灯，也有用瓦斯灯（电石灯）的。伴随着忽闪忽闪的火油灯，我经常在微光下赶作业。再到后来，遇到停电的时候用起了蓄电池的灯。这就是之前应对停电时照明的措施。
除了照明受影响，停电其实对于我们日常的饮食、取暖影响其实并不算大。
作为一个深处胶东腹地的山村，我们当地日常的燃料主要是苹果树的枝条及各种作物的秸秆藤蔓，「果木炭烤」再平常不过了。农村烧火做饭顶多用一下鼓风机来助燃（有些家庭甚至还在使用传统的、节能环保的风箱），所以停电时候把鼓风机变成用扇子扇，不影响炭火正常燃烧。
每家每户必备的取暖设备则是火炕。火炕可以将灶台做饭时产生的多余热量引导至炕内，用来给室内供暖。虽然现在很多人家里使用上了液化气、添置了土暖气、空调，但火炕始终是一个标配。因此，停电对于取暖的影响也算不上大，除了极少数喜好电热毯的人。
胶东地区民居中很常见的火炕，利用厨房余热取暖
停电也不影响村里供水。村民们的日常用水来自井水，而且每家都有一个储水用的大水缸，所以几乎不存在停水一说。
整体上来讲，停电对于传…</span>

                    <span>正所谓「硬件是基建，软件生产力」，在软件正版化理念逐渐成为主流的当下，免费好用的「开源」软件也成了不少人的选择。对于个人用户来说，使用开源软件有如下优势：

更便宜：降低软件授权费用，节约使用成本；
更安全：相对于闭源的软件来说，我们无法看到其内部代码，对个人隐私的顾虑只能依靠软件厂商的诚信度和法规，而开源软件公开了源代码，就算我们自己不会看，也会有其他程序员朋友帮助甄别筛选，相对更可靠一些；
更稳定：本文介绍的软件大部分是比较老牌的软件，持续运营多年具有稳定性。

作为已经过了「不当家不知柴米油盐」年纪的普通用户，应对当前大势所趋的订阅及超前消费的方式就是选择适合自己的开源软件。其次，作为折腾软件十余年但不会编程的「玩家」，天然对开源软件有亲切感，非常喜欢这种奔着相对纯粹目的完善能够造福更多人的工具。
最后，「实用为王」能够解决实际问题且符合自己使用习惯的开源软件会作为我的首选。本人日常工作生活主要用到 Windows 和 macOS 平台，偶尔还需要折腾 Linux。本文本着「完全无需付费，也能很好用」这一原则，我挑选了个人使用过的 18 款开源软件分享给大家。
文本工具
Simplenote：跨平台文本收集工具

平台: Windows / macOS / Linux / 移动端
官网: https://simplenote.com/
软件性质: 开源

当你想要快速记录稍纵即逝的灵感时，肯定不会喜欢需要繁琐操作步骤才能记录或者启动缓慢的 App。如果能够更进一步，能够把随时随地记录自动同步或聚合就更好了。为了实现这一目标，我试用了多款收费及开源工具，最终保留了 Simplenote 作为主力碎片文本收集和同步工具。相比其他软件，Simplenote 具备如下优势：

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

前言
在日常使用中我们会因为种种原因，从各种地方保存图片、动图和视频，而在 iOS 的默认 App「照片」中，它们大部分时候都会被存放在同一个文件夹——系统相册中。虽然有的 App 会独立创建文件夹，但那对于日常使用和相册管理来说只是杯水车薪，你的系统相册里还是十分混乱。
相册内容之多，靠手动的 Slidebox 已经拯救不了了
我在 2017 年转到 iOS 之前一直是个安卓用户，当时用的手机会默认把「相机相册」和剩下全部图片分开储存，在我眼中是一个很好甚至必须的功能。从逻辑上也更加合理：保存的图片与拍摄的照片本就是不同的内容，自然要保存到不同的位置。
将照片独立出来的好处不止分类，在翻看相册时也会拥有更好的体验，在看着照片触动回忆时不会被无关的图片干扰。值得一提的是，iOS 的「照片」里其实是有分类的，遗憾的是「媒体类型」中从视频到动图的 11 个分类里，没有一个是「相机相册」。
系统相册自带的分类功能
虽然如此，我们还可以用苹果自己在 Mac 端的工具「智能相簿」，曲线救国凭空造出一个「相机相册」出来。
正文
通过 iCloud 照片和 Mac 端「照片」App 在独有的「智能相簿」功能，可以在苹果设备创建一个所谓的「相机相册」。方法如下：
1. 左侧分栏——相簿——点击加号
Mac版「照片」App 的边栏
2. 新建智能相册——条件——相机型号——包括——iPhone。
如果曾拥有多部 iPhone手机（如曾用 iPhone 8 现用 iPhone 13）选择 iPhone 会将系列的照片全部包括
如果手机里有其他设备（如 iPad，单反相机或其他手机）拍摄的照片并且也希望保存的话，重复第二步，将最后的 「iPhone」改为相机型号，分别建立智能相簿。
3. 因为系统会把你在 iPhone 上的屏幕截图认定为是 iPhone 拍摄的照片，所以我们需要给智能相簿再添加一个条件：
光圈——在范围内——ƒ/1.8至ƒ/32（即全部范围）
因为屏幕截图和保存的图片不会带有光圈信息，所以这一条可以过滤掉手机中无关的保存图片
4. 当所有相机型号的智能相簿都被建立后，仿照第一步新建一个普通相簿，将之前建立的几个「智能相簿」拖拽进去。 合并成一个完整的相簿。
编注：在 Mac 上创建的「智能相簿」不会 显示 在 iPhone 或 iPad 上的「照片」中，因此需要第四步以及后续维护。
5. 现在，你终于有了你本就该有的「相机相册」。
6. 因为第四步中合并出的「完整相簿」并非智能相簿，所以它需要不定期更新。方法也很简单：想起来的时候顺手把装着 iPhone 照片的智能相簿（第二步创建的相册）再拖进「完整相簿」就可以完成更新，新的照片会被添加，旧的照片不会重复。
尾声
第一次在少数派写文章，如有疏忽漏洞还敬请谅解，欢迎在评论区讨论话题与指出问题。
感谢老麦点赞我的微博想法，不然我也不会完善我的想法并把文章出来。其实契机只是自己整理相册的时候被气得忍无可忍了还搜不到教程而已。
虽说绕了一大圈终于把心心念念的相机相册弄了出来，但如此基本的设置苹果没有做还是很让人沮丧，还是希望苹果早日浪子回头。

                    <span>开发者来强答一波
《物理世界》的灵感诞生于CIGA Game Jam 2019上。
当时的题目是一张这样的图片：



（看到图片的我亿脸蒙蔽XD）
但没办法，题还是要做的哇，所以我就在想，这爱心到底怎么插入小人中奖的三角形？

一般正常情况下看到这个问题，肯定是会想到“父母的爱对孩子来说太沉重”，“看起来好的东西不一定适合自己”一类的观点，但可能是我苦于物理荼毒久已，导致我第一时间想到的事居然是——

爱心通过怎样的形态变化能成为三角形，最终契合进小人的内心？我脑内闪过了一万个公式，发现都没有办法解决我的疑惑。
进而，我联想到了《Baba is you》——一款通过不同的组合方式产生不同的效果，最终解决谜题的作品。




虽然和物理世界不尽相同，但通过不同组合方式，改变角色行动逻辑，最终让角色成功移动到终点的解谜内核触动了我。彼时的我已经把题目图片抛之脑后，满脑子只想的是“我要把各种物理公式嵌进一款解谜游戏中”，让玩家再次体验被物理课堂所支配的......
就这样，初版的物理世界诞生了。

（老版本的物理世界，当时主角还不是盒娘）

尽管Game Jam很快就结束了，我们对继续制作《物理世界》的热情却丝毫没有熄灭。
首先，我们决定更换美术素材——黑板的绿底白字让人感觉过于古板，于是我们打算采用更卡通的风格让画面更有活力。


Game Jam上制作的版本中的地图的地形均为直接绘制，这不利于后续关卡的搭建和维护。我们首先换用了TileMap插件来搭建地形和绘制方块。但它的自由度不是很高，有些比较不规则的图形无法实现。于是我们又换用了更加自由的SpriteShapeController来编辑地形。


继续制作解密游戏最重要的一点就是丰富关卡内容了。为了扩充关卡内容，我们在接下来的时间里制作了更多的关卡，包括摩擦力关卡、浮力关卡、圆周运动关卡以及动量关卡。

 摩擦力关卡

浮力关卡

圆周运动关卡

动量关卡
一切关卡的设计思路以有趣为前提，为此我们也都是绞尽脑汁，不断迭代我们的作品。
当内容逐渐丰富之后，游戏主要矛盾逐渐转移到了用户的游玩体验之上。
在游玩《Baba is you》的过程中，尽管你会被他惊艳的创意所折服，但有时也会莫名其妙的过关弄昏头脑。
如果玩家与设计者的脑洞没有对上，关卡的乐趣就会骤减，原本精妙的解谜关卡设置在玩家眼中可能会“过于电波系”，让玩家一头雾水，卡关的挫败感也许会让他们不再打开这部作品。

为了解决这样的问题，在设计比较复杂的关卡的时候，我们或有意或无意地留下了多于一种的过关方式。




在这个关卡中，你可以选择黄色和紫色方块中任何一个用于垫脚

我们加入了提示系统以避免避免玩家长时间的卡关导致失去兴趣的情况出现，但于此同时，我们也不会给予玩家包办式的过关引导——玩家依然需要去考虑如何实现提示系统中的各条提示，它们一般都不会太难，只是需要花点时间。


同时，为了玩家能够更好地get到我们设计时的脑洞，我们也特地的在靠前的引导关卡中以更简单的方法呈现给玩家。

这个关卡的过关方式中需要用方块将红色小旗撞下来。
在本作最开始的测试中，许多玩家第一次看到这样的关卡时，往往无法第一时间悟到本关的解谜机制，最终会因为定式思维卡关很久。
我们注意到了这点，于是在较为前面的关卡中加入了这样的一关来进行引导。

这关需要玩家用蓝色方块将红色小旗撞下
这样一来，玩家能更容易地理解并利用这样的机制进行解密。
在游戏进行测试的过程中我们发现，有的玩家在一开始就难以理解这个游戏的机制——用物理公式来控制场上的物体。甚至在第一关就不知所措。于是我们又额外增加了教程关卡来解决这个问题。


教程关中通过文字一步步的指导，让玩家了解游戏的机制以及游玩思路——这成功地降低了游戏的上手难度，也让这部作品能够得以有机会被更多用户所看到。
一起来体验《物理世界》的美妙吧！

                    <span>屠龙勇者终成恶龙，一种循环何时结束？
注：为求简单，本文许多处会称呼索尔斯克亚为索肖。
新教练上任，欣欣向荣，一切向好，给人希望。但在执教中期，教练技战术在锐意革新与固执保守中打转。在执教末期，教练自掘坟墓式地弃用可用之人，一步步把自己宽裕的手牌变成买人不利阵容太薄。这一集，你是不是已经看过无数遍了？这样循环播放的戏码，在后弗格森时代不断上演，以致于按下快进键也不会漏掉关键剧情。
这，就是这些年的曼联。
作为球员，索尔斯克亚与曼联共同拼下过至高荣誉，也陪俱乐部一起经历过短暂重建的低谷。作为教练，他受命于危难之际，一度曾经展现过从二流向一流进化的希望，但因一念之差选择了虚假的弗格森传统，并没有搞清曾经的荣光岁月因何而成功，在自己团队本该最擅长的长期建队和进攻上不断摇摆，不断退化，最终跳水成为三流之选，并不冤枉。
以前看过我总结的朋友，这篇文章可能会出现大量你见到过的段落，就当是回顾一下往事吧。
一、什么应该是真正的弗格森理念？
这一次的文章，我们改一下顺序，首先讲明白，我们期待在弗格森以后的教练身上看到什么？要弄清楚这一点，不得不探讨：什么才是真正的弗格森理念？是全力进攻吗？是本土化吗？是坚持青训DNA吗？是前锋中卫扛大旗，边路两翼齐飞释放压力，中场只要会分边会站位就行吗？
如果你回想起弗格森懂权变、能屈能伸的战术变化，如果你回想起基恩、哈格里夫斯甚至弗莱彻短暂带来给曼联的腰板，如果你回想起范佩西、贝尔巴托夫、维迪奇、埃弗拉、年轻版C罗甚至争议极大的特维斯、范尼斯特鲁伊、基恩等等外来球员带来的比赛场面，恐怕你很难认同上述的任何一条。可惜的是，这些有争议的弗格森理念，一条不落地被现任曼联教练组奉若圭臬。
弗格森真正的理念是什么？我妄自揣摩，只有一个字，就是“赢”。如果用两个字形容的话，就是“求胜”。用更多字形容的话，就是管你用什么方法，怎么能赢怎么来。

                    <span>车田宇宙中如此文艺范儿，且带有一定现实意义的作品实属稀有。随中华风飘荡，空气中还弥漫着浓浓的欧洲文艺气息。


本作最终BOSS 机械皇帝，可以说是效仿文艺复兴，实施了他的人类复兴。也就是他追求的人类再生『Human Renaissance』。


但在他眼里的文艺复兴，如同办家家酒已被贬得一文不值，根本不配冠以复兴之名。



机械皇帝制造的 B’T ，其原型是他在卫星内培养的人工生命体（Homunculus）！


Homunculus  的制法本就是文艺复兴时期的炼金术师所著。


这些被培养的细胞，又都被冠以了文艺复兴时期的众多天才之名。









其中孵化成功的仅有ラファエロ。音译有拉法罗或拉法尔。但此名字也正是文艺复兴后三杰中拉斐尔的名字。


机械皇帝距今700 多年前就已存在。因为十六世纪中期，他在佛罗伦萨遇到娜夏与米夏的时候，就已经存活了200年以上。






追溯回去，他出生以及成长的时期，正是处于文艺复兴的十四世纪。


▽
或许是他拥有远远超出常人的才华，其理想在当时的世人看来，是如此荒唐，亦或被当作邪道。


即便是现在，想必也难以苟同。


但他对此的反馈是『对超出认知的东西，人们往往都会用恶魔来定义』。



人类的生命无永恒，可看作是被神所分配的行使权利。对于机械皇帝来说，或许这就是一种『封建制度』。


他毅然的举起了反『封建』的新文明运动的旗帜。只为创造一个他所谓的理想世界，一个以他为神的永生世界。


作为对抗机械皇帝的力量，首当其冲的是以中国神话四灵为模型的存在。


想必在ACG中，四神更为常见，且出境率更高也更讲究方位。



为何选择四灵不得而知。但四灵为瑞兽，有吉祥之兆，这或许是在暗示，四灵是为人类带来稳定吉祥的象征吧。


四灵又以麒麟为首，麒麟现身，也就代表了盛世安康。这可能也是，为什么麒麟是主角的原因之一。

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
This series is inspired by Wadzee and Luke TheNoteable Hardcore Minecraft Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it&#x27;s actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.

Introduction
Shaders
Setup
Shader Code
Conclusion
For those of you who love rabbit holes, learning graphics programming is a pretty deep one. There’s always some new thing to learn, there’s a bunch of different new languages and toolsets to know, and on top of all that, there’s math. Like anything else in programming, you pick up momentum with each new thing you build, so I found a tutorial and started making shaders. I know very little about this. However, I’m writing what I’m learning, so don’t come for me if I’m off on anything. 



A shader is a program that runs on the GPU as part of the graphics pipeline. We’re going to focus primarily on shaders in Unity. There are other ways to tackle this, but Unity gives an easy setup to get started quickly. For the context o…</span>

                    <span>Over two years ago (gulp), I posted a walkthrough of my Rust implementation of todo-mvp by @gypsydave5
 demonstrating how to build a simple Rust API without a framework.  The core functionality was built using hyper, a lower-level HTTP library instead of a full-blown framework.
It turns out I wrote that post about six months too early.  I published it in May 2019, and in November, Rust released 1.39.0 containing async/await syntax.  Womp womp.
My intent here was to simply upgrade the existing application to use the new syntax where applicable and call it a day.  But, you know that thing that happens when you go back and review code you wrote years ago?  Yeah, that thing happened. 
Our result functions almost identically to the implementation in the previous post, so some of this code will …</span>

When I did start bothering about it... what was my surprise when everywhere I saw they would just resize the screen and call it a day.
Granted, it was usually because one thing was being explained and most of the time... it will be enough...
Sometimes just resizing your desktop browser isn&#x27;t enough... you have to use it on the real thing.
And if that&#x27;s the case... what if I told you, you could have your desktop debugging experience in your phone?

But that&#x27;s not all, some of the programming languages I will create for purpose of this series. So if you follow along, you&#x27;ll see not just a lot of different programming languages, but you might also learn a thing or two about how to create your own.
I won&#x27;t be shy about my opinions, and I might be even exaggerating a bit. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.
Episodes will all be indepedent. Target audience is people who know programming, but don&#x27;t know a 100 difference languages, so I&#x27;ll often use some less idiomatic ways of doing things if I think it&#x27;s clea…</span>

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It helps us to write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it&#x27;s mostly used as a state management tool with React.
According to the official documentation,

I spent this weekend playing around with Scala.js and learning how to manipulate browser cookies with it.
Check out the live demo at cookies.awwsmm.com.
The source is available at github.com/awwsmm/CookiesScalaJS.
There are a few cool Scala flairs here, particularly this bit which pattern matches on a regular expression
  def clearAllCookies(): Unit &#x3D; {
    val Cookie &#x3D; &quot;([^&#x3D;]+)&#x3D;.+&quot;.r
    document.cookie.split(&quot;; &quot;).foreach {
      case Cookie(key) &#x3D;&gt; clearCookie(key)
      case other &#x3D;&gt; err.println(s&quot;Couldn&#x27;t parse &#x27;$other&#x27; as a key&#x3D;value cookie pair&quot;)
    }
  }

In order to ensure that users don&#x27;t include the ; or &#x3D; characters in their cookie keys and values (which confuses the parser), I&#x27;ve also added these two little safeguards, as well
    // prevent the user from typing &#x27;;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; into the input
    input.addEventListener(&quot;keypress&quot;, (e: dom.KeyboardEvent) &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (e.key &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;;&quot; || e.key &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;&#x3D;&quot;) {
        e.preventDefault()
      }
    })

    // prevent the user from pasting &#x27;;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; into the input
    input.addEventListener(&quot;paste&quot;, (e: dom.ClipboardEvent) &#x3D;&gt; {
      val text &#x3D; e.clipboardData.getData(&quot;text&quot;)
      if (text.contains(&quot;;&quot;) || text.contains(&quot;&#x3D;&quot;)) {
        e.preventDefault()
      }
    })

What do you think? Anyone else on DEV doing anything cool with Scala.js?</span>

Introduction

Typescript is superset of Javascript which means it is an extension of Javascript, adding new features and syntax on top of the core language.
Typescript is a strongly typed, object-oriented &amp; compiled language.
Typescript is designed to be compiled into fully compatible Javascript, so it works in any browser, any host, and any OS. 
We need typescript compiler to compile it to Javascript code because browsers do not understand typescript.
Typescript strongly encouraged static-typing which means it will validate all the assertions before the code executes. It allows you to do a type check during…</span>

                    <span>After months of hard work, I have finally released my NFT collection called Extravagant Whales. 
At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about NFTs, but the more I dived into the NFT world, the more I was convinced about finishing my collection.
NFTs are unique tokens which can be images, videos, audio files, and any other types of digital files. NFTs are deployed on the blockchain and use blockchain technology to generate a public proof of ownership.
I didn&#x27;t create my NFTs for the money or the fame of being recognized. I did it for the learning process and what&#x27;s behind creating NFTs.
I&#x27;m not an artist, so I used programming and some tools which were already created by some awesome people such as Daniel Eugene Botha (HashLips) and Rounak Banik (Scrappy Squirrels) to generate my collection. I did c…</span>

Some familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.
Arrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.
The Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.
Below is a typical example of how the filter function is used:
var arr1 &#x3D; [1,2,3,4],
    arr2 &#x3D; [2,4],
    res &#x3D; arr1.filter(item &#x3D;&gt; !arr2.includes(item));

console.log(res);

When this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array.

这篇文章从“五种特性”的角度向大家介绍我的Marginnote-Zotero学术写作工作流，Applescript脚本、Alfred插件以及Obsidian插件是连通这两样工具的桥梁。
我希望从阅读、摘录、整理、成稿的整个环节全面补齐Marginnote在学术写作方面的短板。有了Zotero的支持，Marginnote不再是无根之木、无源之水，而是处处有据可考、处处有证可依的内容发掘工厂与思维孵化器。。你可以在一个笔记本中绑定多篇pdf进行专题性的文献阅读，也可以先使用子脑图划分不同出处的摘录，最后再通过引用卡片，在新的框架中迭代整合，进而获得获得系统性的梳理文稿。
过去的“边写边引”变成“自动识别引用”、“自动生成参考文献列表”，阅读时分神来回切换阅读器和文献管理工具进行参阅和引用彻底成为过去式。以Markdown为载体的写作更专注于内容，结合Obsidian的Pandoc插件一键完成优雅的终稿排版。

                    <span>不少读者可能会有同时使用多个浏览器的习惯，比如在 Windows 上使用 Microsoft Edge、在 macOS 上使用 Safari、在移动端则使用 Chrome。在这种使用场景下，实现不同浏览器之间的书签同步也是个不小的需求——毕竟书签内容往往会随着我们的浏览行为发生变化，每次切换平台、浏览器都进行一次导出、导入还是比较麻烦。
作为一个多平台、多浏览器都在使用的用户，在今天的文章中我将分享一些能够在不同浏览器之间实现书签同步的解决方案。
Chrome、Edge 以及 Firefox 的书签同步
在桌面端，基于 Chromium 内核的浏览器（主要是 Chrome、Edge）与 Firefox 因为都有着丰富的扩展生态支持，因此也可以通过浏览器扩展来实现书签管理与同步。
个人比较推荐的是以下两款：
xBrowserSync
如果你想要开箱即用的多浏览器书签同步服务，最佳选择就是 xBrowserSync。
这款工具支持的浏览器包括 Firefox 以及各种基于 Chromium 的浏览器，只需在对应浏览器的扩展商店中搜索 xBrowserSync 并安装即可。

在扩展中点击 xBrowserSync 开始设置同步，直接点击 next 然后会让你输入对应的密码——之后服务会自动生成一个同步 ID，默认同步的服务器为主服务器，当然 xBrowserSync 也提供多个镜像同步服务器（服务器列表）方便我们进行选择，你可以根据具体的网络情况点击下方的 Switch Service 来切换到更为稳定的服务器。

输入两遍密码之后，你当前浏览器的书签会以书签文件的形式自动同步到 xBrowserSync 服务器中。点击扩展程序栏中的 xBrowserSync 图标，你可以对书签进行管理，设定相关的同步服务。比如对在线书签进行搜索、添加当前标签页为书签等等。

在系列的第三期文章《玩转 Obsidian 03：如何记录「间歇式日记」》中介绍过如何通过「间歇式日记」管理自己的日常工作和生活：

「间歇式日记」是著名的生产力教练 Coach Tony 在2017 年发表的《Replace Your To-Do List With Interstitial Journaling To Increase Productivity》文章中提出的一个概念。他认为「间歇式日记」可以更好的帮助自己集中精力更聪明的工作。「间歇式日记」既不同于常规的「日记」，也不同于常规的「任务管理软件」，它更强调围绕着「工作流」打造一个「正反馈描述」从而提高「生产力」。

「间歇式日记」的运作方式其实很简单，一句话总结：

在每个「工作间歇」，以「时间戳」为单位，采用类似「日记」的形式做的笔记。

在实际使用中「间歇式日记」也不会有太多负担，因为适当总结和梳理总是会帮助我们「理清现状」并开始下一个行动。但是，在使用「间歇式日记」一段时间后我发现了几个问题。
间歇式日记的问题
问题1：笔记优先法则 Vs 文件夹管理
在《玩转 Obsidian 04：为什么推荐使用 Obsidian 做知识管理》文章中专门提到 Obsidian 遵循「笔记优先法则」，这是它的优势之一：
笔记优先法则
「笔记优先法则」要求我们我们完全不需要考虑文件「存到哪里」这件事，只需要关注文件的「双向链接」以及 Tag 即可。并且借助 Obsidian 强大的搜索和关联能力，我们可以很方便的找到各种笔记。
在实际使用场景中，每天的「间歇式日记」经常要关联…</span>

                    <span>For a lot of useful State Related Hooks, Checkout my Library merced-react-hooks
To quick setup application wide state in your app just make a file called src/GlobalState.js in your react app.
GlobalState.js
import { useState, createContext, useContext } from &quot;react&quot;

// The initial state, you can setup any properties initilal values here.
const initialState &#x3D; {
    count: 0
}

// create the context object for delivering your state across your app.
const GlobalContext &#x3D; createContext(null)

// custom component to provide the state to your app
export const GlobalState &#x3D; props &#x3D;&gt; {
  // declare the GlobalState
  const [globalState, setGlobalState] &#x3D; useState({})

  // create a function that&#x27;ll make it easy to update one state property at a time
  const updateGlobalState &#x3D; (key, newValue) &#x3D;&gt; {
    setGlobalState(oldState &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (oldState[key] !&#x3D;&#x3D; newValue) {
        const newState &#x3D; { ...oldState }
        newState[key] &#x3D; newValue
        return newState
      } else {
        return oldState
      }
    })
  }

  return (
    {props.children}
  )
}

// custom hook for retrieving the provided state
export const useGlobalState &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; useContext(GlobalContext)

then you just have wrap your application with the GlobalState component in index.js

    


then in any component you can use the state. Below is an example of a counter component using the GlobalState.
import {useGlobalState} from &quot;../GlobalState.js&quot;

function Counter(props){

    const [globalState, updateGlobalState] &#x3D; useGlobalState()

    return 
{globalState.count}
 updateGlobalState(&quot;count&quot;, globalState.count + 1)}&gt;Add One
     updateGlobalState(&quot;count&quot;, globalState.count - 1)}&gt;Subtract One
    

}

There you go, now you can share state across your app in an easy that you can customize to your needs.</span>

                    <span>When you are working on a project, it is very useful to know the history of the modifications using git. If you are coding on Visual Studio Code like me, you should activate git blame by following these steps :
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Press Ctrl+Shift+X (windows) or ⇧⌘X (Mac)
- Type blame
- Click install on Git Blame
Now, you can see at the bottom of the vs code window who is responsible for the line of code you have your cursor on, as you can see on the image below: line 37 Sara Ounissi (that would be me), pushed this code 1 day ago.

However, the aim of this option is not just to see who wrote the code, but why and when. You can click on the name of the person, this will open a pop-in, the button View will then redirect you to the git repository where you will see the whole modification, the name of the commit, etc… Hopefully, that will help you get more context.</span>

So every now and then i see something that catches my eye. Recently that seems to be Linux Distributions, over the last few months i have changed my distribution&#x27;s a few times to try and find one i&#x27;m comfortable with. I moved from my iMac (getting a bit sluggish) to Ubuntu originally and it worked but i didn&#x27;t &quot;enjoy it&quot;, i then tried Manjaro, then Pop!_OS and then finally thought id have a go with Elementary OS.
So far i am really enjoying it! it feels a bit &quot;Mac&#x27;ish&quot;, Looks nice and feels quick!
But compared to Ubuntu its a little bit different with the Setup of the dev environment, so i thought id write up a little tutorial on setting a Laravel Dev Environment on Elementary OS.
So as with any tutorial i do with Linux, we start with an update/upgrade.

                    <span>Node.JS is a technology that has transformed JavaScript, which is familiar to all web developers, from a client-side scripting language to a general-purpose language that has a large number of application use cases.
 
At the heart of how Node works.js is asynchronous. In addition to non-blocking I / O, this allows a server-side application on Node.js can handle much more client requests per unit of time than a similar application developed on most other server-side development technologies.
What does this mean for your business?
You can start your own project with relatively low costs for the server infrastructure.
With the right architecture, this allows you to scale your business without investing a lot of money.

                    <span>First let us get over with the debate of Authentication vs Authorization.
It is the process to verify if the user is telling the truth. For example: when we log into our account with some username and password, the process of verifying those credentials with the stored information in database and knowing that the user is really whom he/she claims to be is called Authentication.
It is a security process to know what information user has access to. Giving someone permission to download a particular file on a server or providing individual users with administrative access to an application are good examples of authorization.
In this article we are going to look into two different methods of User Authentication with NodeJS
Sesssion Based Authentication

                    <span>(This was a talk at The ephemeral miniconf, here are the slides)
Once upon a time, 
a guy named Larry Wall 
created a language called Perl.

He became the BDFL 
of this PL 
which values are TIMTOWTDI, 
DWIM, 
POLA 
and as all UNIXes: 
KISS 
and DOTADIW.

Perl enhances some key concepts 
of AWK, 
SED 
or GREP 
and even provides ACK 
and leads industry standard REGEX 
(PCRE).

PPL started to ❤️ Perl, 
meeting in PM groups 
and calling themself JAPH.

Eventually, big-sized meetings appeared 
like YAPC, 
TPC 
and TPRCIC 
(or chartreuse-sized ones like PTS).

There were also associations 
like TPF 
or EPO 
and individuals 
like YOU 
and ME.

FYI in 2021, 
I decided to organize TEM 
because hey, YOLO!

Technically speaking, 
you can say Perl 
or perl 
but not PERL 
nor the horrific PEARL... 😱

And if you don&#x27;t know, 
go on IRC 
and ask PURL! 🤖 

People say 
&quot;Only perl can parse Perl&quot; 
but there is PPI, 
PPR 
and PLS.

Interfacing w/ native extensions is easy 
with FFI, 
XS, 
SWIG 
or WASM 
(and even easier with NCI in Raku).

Perl lovers contribute 
to the CPAN w/ ❤️  
via PAUSE 
so Perl users can use CPANP, 
CPANM 
or CPM 
to DRY.

You can browse MetaCPAN 
for DBI, 
EUMM, 
MB, 
LWP 
or PDL 
or even some idiot ACME.

Each DIST 
contains a whole lot of DOC 
in a format named POD 
and even a dedicated RT Q.

If you&#x27;re in trouble, 
have a look at HOP 
or PBP.

IMHO 
it is a good PPT, 
but maybe a bit WTF... 
IDK 🤷
THX for attending 
and FWIW 
here is a well deserved GIF.

There are many pages wich explain what the Spread Operator (also know as three dots) and Rest Parameters are. 
It is an operator that I really like and I would like to share with you some ways that I use it.
📓 Spread Operator
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (print as array)

When we use the spread operator we get the values ​​independently:
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( ...numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; 1 2 3 4

Add an array to another:
let customers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27; ];
let otherCustomers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ];

customers.push( ...otherCustomers );
console.log( customers );

                    <span>IBM i is a robust and reliable operating environment. It is still used by many organizations today, especially for data-heavy applications.
Over the years, businesses have heavily customized IBM i applications to suit their business processes.
Most of these applications, however, run on an RPG code format that outputs to monolithic 5250 green screens. These screens contrast starkly with modern software expectations.
While 5250 green screens are effective, they don’t provide the rich UX-based experience users demand from modern software applications. In addition, because of the knowledge gap and dwindling talent pool of IBM i developers, most organizations run on multiple computing systems.
They generally have a different IBM i development team siloed from developers working on other comput…</span>

水一篇
这个应该是今年最后一篇文章了，卷累了打算明年在卷了。
年中的时候帮部门招人，发现很多候选人对于我们部门还是很青睐的。也对鸡架部门做的事比较感兴趣，所以今天这篇水文主要就给大家梳理下基架的面试题以及基础架构组涉及的sdk相关。
因为最近几年面试经常被人吊打，所以也有了总结面试题的习惯。之后加上之前帮候选人的面试总结，今天给大家再卷一波。
也不是别的啥就是想要毛面试题的流量了呢。
SDK相关
面试的时候我觉得哦，这些sdk有任意其实你研究的比较深入就行了，应该能在面试中表现的很好了。还有就是个人建议最好还是在单一方向研究的更深入一点，别的只要大概知道干什么的就行了。
配置中心以及灰度测试
app必备工具之一，配置中心主要负责的就是动态化的配置，比如文本展示类似这些的。sdk提供方需要负责的是提供动态更新能力，这里有个差异化更新，只更新dif部分，还有就是流量优化等等需要开发同学考虑的。然后可以考虑下存储性能方面的提升等。
而abtest也是app必备工具之一了，动态的下发实验策略，之后开发同学可以切换实验的页面。另外主要需要考虑灰度结果计算，分桶以及版本过滤白名单等等。这里只是一个简单的介绍不展开，因为我只是一个使用方。
调试组件
个人还是更推荐滴滴的Dokit，功能点比较多而且接入相对来说比较简单。而且提供了很多给开发同学定制的能力，可以在debug情况下增加很多业务相关的测试功能，方便测试同学，核心还是浮窗太方便了。
当然很多实验性的预研功能等其实都可以直接接在这里，然后在测试环境下充分展开，之后在进行线上灰度方案。还有一些具有风险的hook操作，个人也比较建议放在debug组件上。
性能监控框架
这部分有几个不同的方面，首先是异常崩溃方面的，另外则是性能监控方面的，但是他们整体是划分在一起的，都属于线上性能监控体系的。

                    <span>掐指算来，Apple 正式将其桌面端设备的系统架构从 X86 转移到 ARM 也已经有一年左右的时间。这个过程之中 Apple 不仅通过 Rosetta 2 巧妙地解决了原来 X86 应用的兼容性问题，与此同时越来越多的应用开发商也适时地更新应用加入了对 Apple silicon 的原生支持。但对应的则是硬件架构上带来的封闭——虽然提供了所谓的一整套虚拟化实现接口，但一年多来支持 Apple silicon 的虚拟化软件却屈指可数。
作为 Mac 平台上较为老牌的商业虚拟化软件，VMware Fusion 在推进基于 M1 架构 Mac 虚拟机应用的进展却一直不快，一直到 2021 年 9 月才推出了首个技术预览版。再对比今年四月初就已推出基于 M1 架构正式版虚拟化软件的 Parallels Desktop，VMware Fusion 对于个人用户而言最大的优势可能就是免费了。
VMware Fusion 更新之后，我也在第一时间下载了 VMware Fusion 首个基于 M1 架构技术测试版，来看看这款商业虚拟化软件在 M1 架构下的表现如何。
能安装哪些系统
因为基于 ARM64 架构，因此和 Parallels Desktop 类似，VMware Fusion for Apple silicon Public Tech Preview 也只支持同架构下的系统模拟。也就是说，安装的虚拟机系统也必须是基于 ARM64 的。
但相比 Parallels Desktop 官方原生支持 Windows ARM64，VMware Fusion for Apple silicon Public Tech Preview 明确说明将不会「官方」支持 ARM64 架构的 Windows 系统，仅支持基于 ARM64 的 Linux 发行套件。官方给出的解释则是微软并没有推出零售版…</span>

天气渐渐转凉，吃得也比以前多了起来。但吃归吃，还是不希望自己发胖或影响身体健康。接触「Locabo Diet 低糖质饮食」的概念有一段时间，也进行了相关尝试，但因为我并不是会做饭的人，所以想分享一下市面上就能轻松购买到的相关好物。只需简单的替换，就能减少许多糖和热量的摄入。
什么是 Locabo，什么是糖质
Locabo 严格意义上是日本一个 健康协会 的登录商标，名称来源于 low-carbohydrate（低碳水饮食），但观念有所不同，他们不提倡极端控制碳水，而是适量、健康、美味地进行摄取，因此称自己为 Locabo。

糖质指的是碳水化合物中去除不参与代谢的食物纤维，其他的能参与代谢、产生能量的部分。

Locabo 协会认为现代人饮食中摄取的糖质太多了。一餐饭中，两个饭团+一杯蔬果汁就有 100 g 糖质，而健康的糖质摄取量应该为一餐 20-40 g，再加上加餐 10 g，一天的摄入量应该控制在 70-130 g 之间。
为此，需要做到：1. 米饭半碗；2. 多吃菜、鱼、肉；3. 使用低糖质的甜味剂代替砂糖。综合实践下来，采用低糖质替代品来减糖还是相对容易的，但减少主食的摄入量可能不那么容易，尤其是胃口大的人。不过不要紧，我们可以采用 Locabo 的部分理念来践行减糖活动。
万变不离其宗：无热量甜味剂取代砂糖
少数派作者的 这篇文章 中，「甜味剂的分类和无糖的概念」这一节，介绍了生活中常见的甜味剂。有些甜味剂使用少量即可产生强效甜味，但热量极低，可以作为糖的良好替代品。生活中会用到糖，主要是饮品（如奶茶）、烹饪（如糖醋菜…</span>

                    <span>Even though Apple is slowly migrating from the Lightning port to USB Type-C, many of its older and existing devices still use the Lightning port for charging and data transfer. And the company supplies a Lightning cable with pretty much every product that needs it, but Apple cables are notoriously flimsy and very often break.

                    <span>大家好，我是游戏的作者炒饭。
发布的这个星期情绪波动很大，补了一个长觉到现在终于缓过来了。
到现在为止，游戏卖了大概两万份，很多很多了
虽然距离回本还有距离（抱歉，我烧太多）但希望还是有的。


至于怎么评价自己的游戏，现在还没办法说。
目前的状态很像刚刚考完试的学生，对一切还是懵的。
做项目很像考试，不同的环节是不同的题。


有些题你有把握，做的很顺畅；有的题没把握，瞎写了个答案。
有的题目不会但你蒙对了，有些题本来可以对粗心做错了。
还有些题呢，超出了你的能力范畴，想蒙个答案都不知道怎么写。


反正现在成绩出来了，分数还行。
之前做好了不及格的准备，做好了暴死的准备。
后路也准备好了，简历写了好几份，打工的地方也联系过。
现在看来……虽然中间一波三折，但暂时应该不用去打工了。


回过头看去，项目里问题很多，
系统的，设计上的，剧本里节奏的，人物设计上的都有。
还有大家很诟病的结局，结尾的都合降神，段子太多建政水平低，
这些问题无法辩驳，狡辩找理由也没啥意义。


借口也好找——受限于时间也受限于水平，
就像考试的时候遇到难题，超出了你的水平和知识储备，
这种题你只能强行答，答完了检查多少遍，也未必能改对。


接着往下说估计又要开始哭穷了，说点梦想啊之类的场面话，
但这两年大家都不容易，谁都穷，谁也都有梦想。
与其说那些，不如说点更有意思的。


其实最早这是个卖萌的游戏，篇幅很短（2-3小时时长），
当时手上钱不多，做外包垫了一些钱回不来，不敢做规模大的企划。
正好去日本旅游（购物旅行团）了几天，认识了很多做代购的大妈，
那几天梦见自己去阴间做代购，代购什么黄泉化妆品孟婆汤阴间树叶。
后来就根据这个写了个小故事，男主角是个骗子，骗了个兔子精去做代购。
故事也没啥主题，就是纯卖萌，日常，搞笑，带点小温馨。


然后剧本我刚开了个头，疫情来了。作为武汉人很崩溃。

  What is Open edX® ?


Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:
Ansible Playbooks which has 1 or multiple roles. Imaging Playbook as full instructions on how to install your software, it&#x27;s components and how the set them up to work properly.
Ansible Roles. Each component in your stack has it&#x27;s own role. for example if your are using Djang…</span>

                    <span>Looking back...


Last week in class we added automated testing to our Static Site Generators (mine is called textToHTML). This included some tests for Jest which make sure the core functionality of our programs work as expected.
After writing our tests, if you run npm run test from the command line it will run the tests. But... what if someone who is contributing to your repository forgets to run the tests before committing? 
Introducing continuous integration (I&#x27;m using the GitHub version). 
This allows you to set up a .github folder containing a .yml file to configure your tests to run automatically on any push or pull request to your repository. The above linked article shows step by step how to set up the configuration folder and file for either Node.js or Python.

                    <span>YouTube is testing changes in its platform that could affect one of the most classic indicators about the temperature of a video: dislikes. From their Twitter account they explained that these are some new design changes in which the amount of dislikes on videos will not be shown, but curiously the button will remain there.
At the moment, YouTube says that this will be a &quot;small experiment&quot; that some users may see during the next few weeks. However, creators will still be able to see the exact number of &#x27;likes&#x27; and &#x27;dislikes&#x27; from YouTube Studio.
The equivalent of &quot;review bombing&quot; on YouTube, these are campaigns where users go en masse to click the &#x27;dislike&#x27; button on a video. YouTube says it has implemented this change after talking to creators who have been victims of such campaigns.

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Nov. 18th, we had our first Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 1. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.
How do you currently collect user experience data?
What works well with your approach? 
What&#x27;s still challenging?
Megan Sullivan and Amber Matz both mentioned feedback widgets embedded in the docs they worked on. These widgets ask if the page was helpful. They also offer an open text field to add more comments. 
Sarah Rainsberger and I both mentioned receiving feedback from our communities directly.

                    <span>After several weeks of writings about Kubernetes, I want to write a short post about React, about libraries, because man can not live only on Kubernetes. 
These are some of the libraries that I consider most useful and cool in React. For obvious reasons, React-router, Redux, and other well-known ones are excluded. As well as some React Frameworks such as Gatsby, Nextjs, Frontity, and others.
Ant Design
Ant design is beautiful, yes, there is not much that can be deepened using text. It has tons of components that are visually pleasing and very stylish: buttons, sliders, progress bars, layouts, you know, the basics. Make sure to visit their site and see for yourself all that Ant design has to offer when you are done reading this post, of course.

Docker has quickly become an essential platform for application containerization. By empowering developers to rapidly deploy apps and host them in the cloud, Docker has simplified the dev cycle by expediting the process of building scalable, modern applications.
Docker Compose
Compose For Local Development
Docker Compose takes the convenience of containers one step further, by streamlining each service’s building and runtime config into a single process. With Compose, it’s as simple as:
Define how to build your app’s services with a 
Dockerfile
Define how to run your app’s services in the 
docker-compose.yaml
Build and run your app with docker-compose up

We have a div and inside we have a label, an input and a ul, this input will be where we will type the information and when the information matches the list we have it will be displayed in ul

本周话题：政府的存储需求有多大？
最近，有一条新闻吸引了我的注意。
美国达拉斯警察局迁移内部数据，不小心误删了 22TB 的数据，后来找回 14TB，剩下的 8TB 确认丢失。
丢失的数据里面，有一个谋杀案的所有文档、图像、视频。证据没了无法起诉，而嫌疑人又不认罪，警方正在讨论怎么办，最后很可能只能把他放了。

大家觉得上面这条新闻，什么地方值得注意？
不是误删数据，那种事情每天都在发生。我觉得，重点是警察局的数据超过了 22TB。这个容量不算小，说明它的硬盘保存了很多东西，而且应该是有一个自己的存储系统，搞不好还有机房。
达拉斯的人口是130多万，警察局的存储超过了 22TB，整个美国的人口是3亿多，你说所有警察局的存储空间加在一起，该有多大？
美国的警察局属于州政府，国家一级的治安机关是联邦调查局 FBI，它的存储恐怕更大，此外还有其他政府部门（比如国防部、财政部、中央情报局......）。这么一想，美国政府单位消耗的硬盘真是不得了，恐怕是一个天文数字。

我接着想到，中国政府单位的存储需求，也是天文数字吧。好在这可以查，政府采购需要招标，招标公告一般发布在政府采购网。

我全文搜索&quot;存储&quot;，过去半年有11431条采购公告。

各省的各种单位都有，采购金额从几十万到几百万不等，大家可以去看。我随便摘录几条。

[美剧] 黄石 第四季

关键词：剧情 / 西部
片长：50 分钟（单集）× 7 集；豆瓣链接

民风淳朴哥谭市，热情好客黄石人～

@潘誉晗：相信不少剧迷都认为《黄石》是更加现实的《西部世界》，的确，比起后者，在一个游戏世界中建立秩序寻找人性这样的设定，《黄石》是更为接近西部荒蛮却真实的存在。它包括家族、政治、不同立场之间的斗争，也不乏西部的野性和叛逆。
剧集围绕达顿家族展开，当家人约翰是坐拥全美最大牧场黄——石牧场的牧场主，而牧场得天独厚的地理位置和自身发展所带来的巨大财富，自然也引来了许多人的觊觎。比如企图把这里发展成新城市的开发商；认为这里应该属于印第安人的拥有印第安血统的政治家；还有想分一杯羹的政府。在…</span>

                    <span>在如今的日常生活中，我们总是离不开各式各样的 App。你也许并不喜欢这个 App，但往往又陷入「不得不用」的困境。你或许不知道，我们每天都在用的这些 App，它们却藏着许多实用的小功能。这篇文章就将带大家一同探寻那些每日 App 中的「隐藏操作」，希望能帮你提升这些 App 的使用体验。
小……功能做的不错的微信
提到「每日 App」，小而美微信或许是许多人又爱又恨的存在。虽然大家总在吐槽微信的各种限制，但作为「国民级 App」的它也确实有着一些鲜为人知的实用功能。
发送视频不被压缩
想必不少人都曾因微信发送视频时被压缩、损伤画质的事情而苦恼，再加上有文件大小在 100M 以内的限制，当不得不在微信传输视频文件时，我们需要借助一些外部的网盘等 App 才能实现。
在对话框中选择下方的文件，打开后在上方切换需传输的文件的位置，可以是手机相册或者是来自 iCloud（Android 则会显示为「手机存储」），即可将视频直接以「文件」的格式发送，无损画质也没有大小限制。

对于有些打工人来说，尽管非常抗拒使用微信办公，有时候也会被迫使用微信接收或者发送文件，甚至常会出现你和你的同事在飞书、企业微信等 OA 软件办公，但却需要将文件在微信上发送给老板。
虽然对于明明有 OA 但非要用微信的行为不理解，作为一个人在屋檐下的打工人却别无他法，比如我们公司，明明电脑上没有权限安装微信，却总有同事要在微信里拉群发送消息。
对于以上这种场景，用手机上的微信传送电脑文件变成了一个强需求，这时候可以先将文件传到 iCloud 云盘，再从「微信 - 文件 - iCloud」中发送，文件大小也没有限制（传输速度比百度网盘快得多），即使发送的文件为压缩包，只要手机里有安装对应的解压软件，也可以打开。

值得一提的是，iOS 上有不少应用都支持了 iCloud Drive，你可以直接在「文件」应用的「浏…</span>

It&#x27;s &#x27;normal&#x27; to be &#x27;disabled&#x27;
残疾是正常的

几乎是几周前（指相对于原文的写作时间 9 月 27 日——译注），我偶然注意到欧洲的一个每年举办一次的活动：包容周（ Inclusion Week），这个活动的时间是 9 月 27 日到 10 月 3 日，旨在庆祝生活中各种各样的「包容」。
这个意外的发现让我思考：包容对我（设计师）而言意味着什么？或者说，包容性设计意味着什么？
什么是包容性设计？
作为设计师我们要清楚，我们做出的每一个设计决策都不一定会包括我们的最终用户。
包容性设计强调理解用户的多样性，并乐于接纳不同的用户真正参与到你的产品、服务甚至组织当中。包容性设计的理念不仅考虑了「普通」或「典型」用户的文化，社交和需求；还考虑了「不正常」，「非典型」的边缘群体。
根据微软的说法：包容性设计是「一种能够充分利用并实现人类多样性的方法。最重要的是，这意味着包容和学习不同的观念。」
1. 包容性设计和无障碍是一回事吗？
包容性设计不是为所有人只做一件事，正如微软设计主管 Susan Goltsman 所说：

包容性设计并不意味着你为所有人设计一件同样的产品；而是说你设计了可以让不同人以不同的方式参与进来的方式，并确保了每个人都…</span>

中国文艺网：习近平总书记在文艺工作座谈会上发表了重要讲话，您个人感觉对我国戏曲事业和戏曲工作者来说具有什么样的意义？
尚长荣：我反复地学习总书记的讲话。我觉得，这次讲话长了戏曲人的志气，长了中华优秀传统文化的志气。总书记的讲话是指针，给文艺工作指引了方向，给广大文艺家、文…</span>

                    <span>16 日，「中共中央关于党的百年奋斗重大成就和历史经验的决议」全文发布，这是中共成立100年以来的「第三个历史决议」，引发全球媒体进一步解读。彭博社称，这份具有里程碑意义的决议，将决定世界第二大经济体的发展方向。「纽约时报」称，决议没有认可任何外国政客对中国外交政策的批评。
为什么全世界都在关注中国？清华大学国家战略研究院资深研究员谢茂松告诉观察者网，中国现在是世界经济最大的引擎。而中国共产党是引领中国经济的重要因素，国际社会当然会对中国崛起和中国共产党未来的路线进行「特别关照」。另外，「中国又不同于美国的「功利主义」，中国打造的是共同体，带动比如发展中国家共同发展。所以全世界都在关注中国」。

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
这场比赛的焦点，在于浓眉对字母在攻防两端的表现。相比起字母哥的在球场两端的发挥，浓眉看上去似乎落了下风。“美国杨毅”史密斯怒斥了浓眉的“回击乏力”，虎扑湖人区更是以“浓眉夺冠赛季后的堕落不自律”为主题，进行了心理与身体状态上的大讨论。然而，如果细究比赛进程，从全局出发，浓眉在进攻端还是发挥出了重要的作用，而在防守端对字母的防守丢分，也更多来自于一种体系中定位的无奈。相应地，威少的进攻端表现则受到了沃格尔的表扬，“打出了湖人生涯最好的一场比赛”。
那么，浓眉的作用是如何发挥的？威少的表现上升，与浓眉有无关联？本场比赛的湖人，是否有一些让人看到一些希望——他们最需要这个，最起码得有“盼头”——的比赛内容呢？

在这支湖人队中，浓眉的防守任务是非常沉重的。在近期的比赛中，湖人常规性地使用了三后卫的阵容。这一排法，当然是为了在现有资源的现实前提下、尽量为威少缓解防守压力。本赛季，威少在防守挡拆持球人时，平均每回合让对手得到0.83分，每场需要完成3.6个回合，占他总防守比例的35.1%.而同队的布拉德利与里弗斯，防守挡拆的回合数比威少还略多0.1和0.2，每回合对手得分只有0.79和0.57分。
而在防守轮转后的弱侧盯人中，威少也往往难以做出正确的判断----他已经在执行湖人防守体系的换防要求，大量增加了防守中的移动，每个防守回合中的移动距离排名队内第一，并非在每个回合中都是蹲篮下等待篮板的懒散存在，但却由于对进攻阅读的不准、防守沟通的不力，他在移动上往往显得犹犹豫豫、去而复返，无效跑动很多，加上运动能力的消耗，便很难执行出坚决、效率的到位换防，防守端的平均移动速度排名队内倒数第三。这就导致了威少在防守端制造的“窟窿”效果：上场时，对手每百回合可以得到109.9分，而下场后湖人反而压到了103.8分。

威少在场上的正向作用主要是进攻端的球权消化，在防…</span>

                    <span>Your CTO handed you a project to revamp or build your product’s notification system recently. You realized the complexity of this project around the same time as you discovered that there’s not a lot of information online on how to do it. Companies like LinkedIn, Uber, and Slack have large teams of over 25 employees working just on notifications, but smaller companies like yours don’t have that luxury. So how can you meet the same level of quality with a team of one? This is the third post in our series on how you, a developer, can build or improve the best notification system for your company.

                    <span>For release 0.3, I worked on IPC144 as my internal project contribution. The issue is Add Progressive Web App (PWA) support.  
I started to install PWA plugin, but Docusaurus, I had some version not matching issue. It turns out that the current project is using an older version of Docusaurus (2.0.0-beta.2). The PWA plugin version has to match the version of Docusaurus to work.
I created another pull request for upgrading Docusaurus to version (2.0.0-beta.8). After the pull request got merged, I can start working on the PWA feature.
To implement PWA, we first need an icon for 192x192  and 512x512. After that, we need to create a manifest.json to add all the settings for PWA.

                    <span>Introduction


While waiting for reviews in my recent pull request, I decided to find a different project. After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.
A quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties&#x27; blogs about anything open-source. 
For my task, I had to customize Telescope&#x27;s build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:
Add header and side navigation bar
Change side navigation default logo into Telescope logo
Update link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./




  
  
  Working on the issue


After setting up the development environment using Telescope&#x27;s documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.
I began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn&#x27;t break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. 
Since I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn&#x27;t break or miss anything.
Similar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.
Cheers! 🍻</span>

                    <span>Section 2: Functions ⚙


Wondering, what&#x27;s up with this weird ancient art? Well, they help portray how civilization evolved much like how we learned to evolve our ways to talk to machines. Like us humans divided our society to do specific tasks say carpenters to work with wood, barbers to trim our hairs, similarly, we can ask machines to work specifically on something or take a specific action when some work is given. As an example imagine, when we wake up, we follow the below step -
Get your bed done &gt; Brush your teeth &gt; Wash your face &gt; Dry your face
For machines, these are described as functions. To understand what a function is imagine a set of instructions that needs to be done when something happens.
Now you might think why do we need to have functions? It&#x27;s simple, however much we l…</span>

                    <span>For release 0.3, I started to contribute on Heptagram repo. The notice that they migrated their website into React. I found out that they do not have prettier set up for the new React project. So I created an issue and asked to be assigned to work on that issue ✨❓ Feature Request: Add Prettier config. 
I first started to install prettier, and add a script for it, one for checking and the other one for writing.
 &quot;prettier&quot;: &quot;prettier --write \&quot;./**/*.{md,jsx,json,html,css,js,yml}\&quot;&quot;,
 &quot;prettier-check&quot;: &quot;prettier --check \&quot;./**/*.{md,jsx,json,html,css,js,yml}\&quot;&quot;

After that, I made .prettierrc.json and add some rules.
{
    &quot;arrowParens&quot;: &quot;always&quot;,
    &quot;bracketSpacing&quot;: true,
    &quot;embeddedLanguageFormatting&quot;: &quot;auto&quot;,
    &quot;endOfLine&quot;: &quot;lf&quot;,
    &quot;htmlWhitespaceSensitivity&quot;: &quot;css&quot;,
    &quot;insertPragma&quot;: false,
    &quot;jsxSingleQuote&quot;: false,
    &quot;proseWrap&quot;: &quot;preserve&quot;,
    &quot;quoteProps&quot;: &quot;as-needed&quot;,
    &quot;requirePragma&quot;: false,
    &quot;singleQuote&quot;: true,
    &quot;tabWidth&quot;: 4,
    &quot;trailingComma&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,
    &quot;useTabs&quot;: false,
    &quot;vueIndentScriptAndStyle&quot;: false,
    &quot;printWidth&quot;: 100
}

I committed and pushed my change to remote, then I created a PR for asking if the prettier format is ok before I run a prettier on all files which change the whole project file format. 
After receiving confirmation that everything is okay. I run npm run prettier to change all the files and commit my change then after a few hours my PR got merged.</span>

                    <span>But why do we need it?


As the frontend becomes larger, while holding multiple domains of responsibilities (for example — navigation, user, authorization, e. g. ), the frontend application is developed, deployed and hosted as a single application. 
Micro-frontends allows us to use those different applications not just on the code base, but also in development, deployment and serve, in order to provide:
Loosely coupled applications
Faster development, debugging, and testing flows
Performance — smaller chunks
Full Isolation while testing, developing, and deploying

During this article we will review the frontend application that is built out of the shell and 3 applications that represent a domain:

                    <span>Changing your company&#x27;s culture can be difficult, especially if you are persuading your boss, company, or leadership team to open source a project. The hard truth is that businesses care about finances, specifically how to acquire and retain money.  Their concerns are valid. Without financial stability and growth, the company is at risk of coming to a halt, which affects its employees and customers. The goal of a business is to stay in business. Perhaps, you understand that, and you see that open sourcing a project will help the company thrive more, but you&#x27;re unsure how to help your employer recognize the value in open sourcing a project.
Here are four concerns your boss may have and responses you can use to alleviate their worries:

I was hesitating in going because I&#x27;m sort of an introvert and going into a room full of strangers is not what I imagine when I think about doing something fun. Fortunately, I pushed myself to go, thinking that, at least, I would listen to what the speakers had to say.
To my surprise, I enjoyed the experience quite much. I didn&#x27;t do much networking, but I could see and hear about people from different backgrounds trying to start (and continue) their careers in software development. The Meetup was focused on junior developers, so the discussion was focused on how to get jobs and the first steps after getting a job.

                    <span>Django is a top Python web-framework known for its features, scalability, and flexibility.
In this guide, we&#x27;ll walk through how you can deploy your Django projects with Cleavr.io.
Before proceeding, you&#x27;ll need to have an active Cleavr.io account and have a server provisioned and ready-to-go.
Add a new NodeJS SSR site to your server in Cleavr.
We&#x27;re using NodeJS SSR as the site&#x27;s app type as it will install Node AND PM2 to the server. PM2 manages more than just node applications, so we&#x27;ll take advantage of this to serve our Django app and keep it alive.
In the Django project, locate the settings.py file, or wherever you have ALLOWED_HOSTS defined, and add the domain used in the previous step to the list of allowed hosts.
For example, this is what our example looks like:
ALLOWED_HOSTS &#x3D; [&#x27;…</span>

We previously made a post about all of our favourite keyboard shortcuts that can help everyone make their daily workflow easier. Now we want to give the developers our favourite shortcuts to make working with your code a breeze. 
We&#x27;re big fans of Visual Studio Code at CodeCast, so I can only say for sure that some of these work on there, but working on virtual code editors, I have had most of them work for me with no issue. So, without further ado, let&#x27;s get started listing some of our favourite keyboard shortcuts for developers.

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第18天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
前言
在 Dart 编码中，我们会经常遇到需要处理 null 的场合。Dart 2.12版本引入 null safety 以后，对 null 的处理有了新的规范。关于 null safety 特性，可以阅读本人的另一篇文章：升级踩坑，聊聊 Dart 的 null safety，本篇介绍如何正确处理 null。
规范1：不要显式地将变量初始化为 null
如果一个变量声明的时候是 non-null 的话，赋值为 null 时，编译器会报错；而如果一个变量声明为 nullable 的话，会隐式地以 null 初始化，因此如果再赋值 null 那就是多此一举了。在 Dart 中不存在未初始化的内存问题，因此没必要初始化为 null。
// 正确示例
Item? bestDeal(List cart) {
  Item? bestItem;
  // ...
}

// 错误示例
Item? bestDeal(List cart) {
  Item? bestItem &#x3D; null;
  // ...
}

规范2：不要为函数参数设置 null 默认值
如果设置一个函数的参数是 nullable 的话，同样的，也会隐式地复制 null，因此没必要重复设置默认值。
// 正确示例
void error([String? message]) {
  print(message ?? &#x27;未知错误&#x27;);
}

// 错误示例
void error([String? message &#x3D; null]) {
  print(message ?? &#x27;未知错误&#x27;);
}

规范3：使用 ?? 操作符将 null 转换为布尔值

@南鱼祭酒：realme Watch T1 橄榄绿 

购买渠道：realme 京东自营旗舰店
入手价格：橄榄绿、活力黑均为原价 699，首发 599；黑薄荷无首发优惠，且仅限 OPPO 商城购买
下单及签收日期：10 月 26 日下定金，31 日付尾款，11 月 1 日发货，2 日签收

今年双十一到手的第一个大货，就是 realme 新发布的第一款智能穿戴产品 T1 手表。T1 共有三种配色，传统的橄榄绿和活力黑，以及颇有 realme 特色的黑薄荷（OPPO 商城独占）。我买到的是橄榄绿配色。

我之前用过的智能手环 / 手表只有三只：索尼 SWR30 手环、跃我（Amazfit）GTR 手表和 OPPO 手环（时尚版），所以我这里比较的对象主要就是它们仨，其它产品我了解得不够全面，如有说错，欢迎大家和气指出。

买这只 T1，对于我个人来说主要原因有这么几个方面：

我的主力手机是 realme X50 Pro，自家的东西理应配合得天衣无缝对吧；
可以离线听歌。据我所知，目前市面上可以离线听歌的安卓手表，价格都要一千起步，T1 标准价 699 首发 599，这个价格太有竞争力了；
可以接听手机。这个功能其实我不太需要（把手腕抬到嘴边说话还有点特工的意思，举到耳边则看起来有点尴尬）；
支持 110 种运动方式（有必要吗？），该有动力运动起来了吧；
最重要的，好看。Realme 的设计风格是冲着年轻人去的，设计师水平也不低，比荣耀、跃我之类的中老年手表好看太多了。

                    <span>这是个信息轰炸的时代，除了必要的信息过滤手段外，每个人都应该构建属于自己的个人知识库。
一、个人数据库避坑指南
前两天有个用户给我邮件问了一些问题，我觉得非常有意思，也很有代表性，所以聊聊这个事情。
为免隐私问题，我把一些内容打码了，请勿对号入座。
使用过笔记类软件的朋友都知道，这位朋友遇到的可能是一个共性问题，也就是：我们自己的笔记究竟该如何处理才最方便、最有助于个人成长？不同的软件有不同的理念，有的服务注重开放性，能够与市面上的其他服务共通，便于定制自己的知识空间；有的软件则认为自己的知识整理理念独一无二且非常优秀，因此相对封闭，便于吸引用户且留住用户。在这篇文章中，针对笔记和知识整理领域，我们来共同探讨关于个人数据整理的问题：

究竟什么样的个人数据存储方案才是好的？
如何构建适合自己的数据存储空间？
构建自己的个性化服务应该注意哪些内容？

1. All-in-one VS All-in-all

先来看第一个问题：什么样的存储方式才是「好」的？
现在是 21 世纪，因为疫情，云服务在这两年大热。在这两年，不少云存储服务也百花齐放。但说到存储，首先要搞清楚我们要存储些什么东西？既然是要存，我们希望的自然是能够「在我想要的时候找到它」，减少损坏、降低遗失的几率。各家云服务为我们提供了随时获取自己数据的权利，但也带来一个问题，那就是：我们存到云端的数据，还是我们的吗？随着不少云服务供应商的政策变化，我们越来越注意到，放在云端，虽然方便获取，但也方便丢失了。靠谱的供应商还给你数据导出和备份的机会，不靠谱的，直接关掉你的账户，你的数据、记忆、情感、心血，可能一瞬间就灰飞烟灭。所以，这两年回归本地仓储的声音也越来越高。因为，放到云里，实在太不稳定了。
那么，多备份几份数据不就好了？
是这样，一个服务商丢了，我们可以从另一家获取。我的还是我的。这就是 All-in-all 的存…</span>

                    <span>浏览器是我们网上冲浪必不可少的工具之一，不管你在用的是哪一款，新标签页往往都是我们进入网络世界的重要入口。因此市面上已经有了不少对新标签页进行美化或增强的第三方扩展程序，比如少数派介绍过的 Momentum、Infinity 等。这些新标签页扩展很多又会以「个性化定制」为卖点，我们在点开浏览器图标的同时，只属于自己的网络浏览体验就已经准备好了。

也正是因为类似的原因，Google 近日推出的 Tab Maker 才如此具有吸引力——作为 Chrome 背后的缔造者，Google 推出的这款小工具将选择权完全交给用户，让我们即便没有任何代码基础也能制作一款只属于自己的新标签页扩展。

和大多数「零代码」工具一样，Tab Maker 为我们提供了非常直观的分步引导和图形化定制界面。在 Tab Maker 官网选择 Make your own 进入在线编辑器页面后，我们首先需要从 11 种预置模板中选择一种进行编辑（也可以导入其它人分享过来的 .zip 文件）。

随后 Tab Maker 会引导我们创建一个用于页面内容搭建的 Google Sheet 表格模板。我们此刻需要做的是生成一份这份表格的副本，并将其保存到自己的 Google Drive 存储中。

然后就是在 Google Sheet 中自由发挥的时候了：

表格中每一行都代表着一个标签页，我们可以为其添加上页面的背景图片、在每个区块中添加上我们想添加的文字或图片（图片需为链接的形式）
也可以为每个区块附加上超链接，这样区块就具备了点击跳转至目标链接的能力

为了避免大家在 Google Sheet 和 Tab Maker 中来回跳转，表格的左上角还贴心地加上了我们选择的模板样式缩略图。
编辑完表格内容后，接下来我们需要将表格转为公开形式：依次点击左上角菜单 File &gt; Share &gt; Publish to we…</span>

                    <span>很多人都会在浏览器收藏夹里常备一个网速测试工具。每当连上一个新网络需要测试效果，或是感觉网络卡顿需要排查故障，这类工具就能派上用场。
但是，这个「裁判员」的选择并不应该是随意的。如果用运营商提供的测速页面，则只能反应到城域网关这一小段的连通性，以此代表实际网速无异于自欺欺人；另一方面，如果测速平台的规模太小，经常匹配到一个远在天边的节点，也会出现「误诊」的问题。
目前，比较常见的选择是 Ookla 旗下的 Speedtest.net；Netflix 开设的 fast.com 也被广泛使用。但是，就国内使用而言，前者并非在所有城市都能找到合适的测速节点，而后者的可访问性则较差。
好消息是，从今年的 macOS Monterey 开始， macOS 已经内置了一个网络情况测试工具 networkQuality。这个工具利用 Apple 遍布全球的 CDN（内容分发网络）服务器来测速，比较客观准确，在很多场景下可以免去寻找第三方工具的麻烦。同时，它还会对当前网络的拥堵情况作出直观的高低评价，帮你快速估测此地是否适合打电话、玩游戏。
基本使用
networkQuality 是一个命令行工具，需要使用「终端」App（或者你首选的其他终端模拟器）运行。方法是：
首先，点按「程序坞」（Dock）中的「启动台」（LaunchPad）图标，在搜索栏中键入「终端」，然后点按「终端」图标。
（或者，在「访达」中，打开 /应用程序/实用工具 文件夹，然后双击「终端」。）
在打开的终端窗口中，输入 networkQuality（注意大小写），然后回车。

此时，系统会开始同时测试下载和上传速度，并将当前速率实时显示在终端窗口中，形如：
current download capacity: 247.850 Mbps - current upload capacity: 9.545 Mbps

                    <span>平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。
首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。
《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。
其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。
然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）
1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。

游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。
2. 关于形状的错觉。

一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。
3. 颜色的错觉。


这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）
4. 负空间。

在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。
5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）

虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。
6. 倒影或平面变成实体

挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。
7. 透过遮罩的场景

我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？
8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方

这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。
游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。
第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。

                    <span>《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。
番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。
当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。
至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。
第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。
第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。
最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。
以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。

                    <span>这是透视相机。 




 
这是笼中窥梦。 




 
这是正交相机。 




 
这是纪念碑谷。 




 
这是平面素材。 




 
这是画中世界。（其实是固定位置的透视相机！不是平面素材那么简单的！） 




 
你发现了吗？透视相机是近大远小的，离镜头比较近的地块要明显大一些。它和人眼在现实中的观察是一致的，所以在绝大多数3D游戏中，你都是用《笼中窥梦》的这种视角去观察周围的世界。 





对于《笼中窥梦》这种解谜游戏来说，选择透视相机和自由视角其实会让设计难度暴增。因为视角稍稍变动，物体的大小就会发生改变。想要找到一个适合做谜题的角度，需要精挑细选，反复琢磨。当然，这也给了谜题设计极大的自由度，能够容纳更有趣的点子。 



而正交相机就比较有意思了：无论物体距离距离有多远，在场景中的大小都能够保持一致。 
所以这种投影模式经常被用来做2.5D游戏，也会用来渲染一些2D场景，使其更有立体感。 



《纪念碑谷》也正是凭借着正交相机的这个特点，将原本分离的两个结构在视错觉下巧妙地组合到一起，进而构建出优秀的谜题： 





平面绘图的画中世界则更加直观。横版游戏都会这样把视角固定在水平面上，优秀的代表作品同样百花齐放： 




 
也同样复杂。 
即使视角固定，《画中世界》也充分利用了透视相机镜头拉远/推近带来的纵深感，设计出高难的谜题。不要真的以为是简单的平面素材啦！《笼中窥梦》的谜题设计思路和它是一脉相承的，也难怪《笼中窥梦》的设计师曾经向《画中世界》的设计师Jason Roberts请教谜题设计的方法。 
《画中世界》镜头推进

所以你会发现，《笼中窥梦》、《纪念碑谷》、《画中世界》虽然分别利用了不同的操纵视角与投影技术，却同样完成了“视觉欺骗”这一艺术效果，各自形成了各自的特色。 
《画中世界》有独特的视觉风格，有将两幅画叠加到一块来推进解谜这种平面艺术独有的思路；《纪念碑谷》依托正交相机，可以肆意改变场景的结构而不变形，为艾达公主用想象不到的方式开山搭桥；《笼中窥梦》解放了视角和操纵的限制，可以在游戏内容中塞入固定视角游戏难以承载的细节，在为谜题设计提供更多可能的同时，支撑起了一个元素众多，情节曲折的明暗线叙事。 




 
视错觉解密游戏为何如此令人着迷？我想，因为绝大部分的游戏也许都是对现实的模仿，但视错觉是对现实的超越。它创新，因为它挑战人的思维边界，因为它是属于电子游戏才能创造出来的独特乐趣。实话说，我很高兴能够看到，我们也能出现一个做出《笼中窥梦》的Optillusion工作室，能在Optical illusion（视觉欺骗）这个领域贡献一些独到精美的东西，和优秀的前辈作品们站在一起也不逊色。

                    <span>The introduction of Infrastructure as Code or IaC has transformed the way you can provision and deploy high-performance cloud-based IT infrastructures.
IaC tools, such as Terraform, have been integrated into DevOps toolchains, saving DevOps IaC teams from the excessive manual effort.
While these tools undoubtedly help accelerate building IT infrastructures, their limitations can impact DevOps’ ability to optimize and improve control of their IaC processes supporting future business needs.
In this article, you’ll learn about IT infrastructure limitations that IaC DevOps teams deal with on a daily basis and how Spacelift is able to get past them.
One of the most frequent challenges while using more generic IaC tools is the non-intuitive workflow driven by its reliance on pull requests. Some …</span>

                    <span>Between meetings today, I learned about Django and continued my journey to a Javascript certificate from FreeCodeCamp.
I started today with working on FreeCodeCamp tutorials for about an hour. I then had to prepare for a couple meetings I had today. Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.
At the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.
I will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.
I also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week&#x27;s worth of changes. 
A little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I&#x27;m not too upset about it. 
A clean slate, a new approach!
I am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it&#x27;s really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. 
Complicated state management between components. I still haven&#x27;t quite nailed it down.
That&#x27;s all for today! Thanks for following, if you have any suggestions, please leave them in the comments below!</span>

  ⚙️ Entendendo um pouco do contexto Geral.


Na computação temos um Tipo chamado: &quot;Booleano&quot;. O que é: Booleano? 
Aqui estamos falando tipo primitivo do TypeScript: &quot;Boolean&quot;. (⊙.☉)7
Ser do tipo (Booleano) significa que algum valor, isto é, alguma variável, constante ou qualquer coisa que possuí em si um valor desse tipo pode ser: 
Verdadeiro (Isto é, true) 👍
Falso (Isto é, false) 👎
O nome &quot;Booleano&quot; (Boolean em TypeScript) faz uma homenagem ao Matemático &amp; Filósofo George Boole, ele &quot;construiu&quot; a base algébrica necessária para a criação Lógica Algébrica que podemos usar para: Operações lógicas (em booleanos) como conjunção (||), disjunção (&amp;&amp;), disjunção exclusiva ((p &amp;&amp; !q) || (!p &amp;&amp; q)), equivalência lógica (&#x3D;&#x3D;) e negação (!), que corres…</span>

                    <span>Problem: Conditional Ellipsis without CSS


I want to add an ellipsis to data that&#x27;s brought in from a service without having to use CSS&#x27; text-overflow: ellipsis feature, since it&#x27;s unreliable and could break overtime if not monitored during refactoring.
Slice Pipe



  
  
  Determine character max overflow limit



Determine max overflow by number of characters (instead of max-width)
Example: max overflow characters 20 (inclusive, aka 20 or more)
I use slice pipe where you add the start and end of the slice to the interpolated string






  {{ item.name | slice: 0 : 20 }}


span



Conditional span is based on data&#x27;s length

                    <span>Isn&#x27;t it wonderful how VS Code grays out obsolete lines of code? Oops, my return statement is on line 3. Line 4 won&#x27;t run... But I haven&#x27;t called the function yet. So how in the world does VS Code know which lines of code won&#x27;t be used in the future, when the code finally does run?

If we have a conditional statement, VS Code accurately evaluates the potential for us to hit the code outside of it:

bool could turn out to be false after all. But if we change the condition to true VS Code knows we will always run that block and (if there is an inevitable return inside) never reach the final line:

It&#x27;s almost as if VS Code has the ability to understand the semantics of code. But under the hood VS Code uses code to do this! How?

  Audience


This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I&#x27;ve tried to make it approachable for beginners but it&#x27;s really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.
In this series we&#x27;re going to start with no authentication and then you&#x27;ll add a very basic authentication system. Then you&#x27;ll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…</span>

然而 1Password 毕竟要付费，也有人会担心这类工具有隐私泄露的风险。其实，如果你有一台自己的 VPS 服务器，那么就能用开源的 Bitwarden 部署搭建一个私人专属的密码管理服务来代替 1Password！这样不仅免费，重要的是，所有的数据均保存在自己服务器上，更加放心……

序言
fish_redux 2.0 FlowAdapter 功能优化，整体业务落地后，我们着手fish_redux新一轮的优化与架构演进。fish_redux 3.x 版本最终的目标保持fish_redux的“生命力”，在框架的易用性，可扩展，核心能力部分做到可持续发展。本文分为三大主题，3.0版本首轮优化部分，架构的思考，后续fish_redux可持续输出部分。
​
fish_redux 3.0.1
关于涉及应用开发领域，相信绝大多数同学都听过或多或少了解MVC模型。MVC 是一个架构的描述，它有不少变种，如MVP， MVVM等，但本质上这些都属于MVC的范畴。MVC的定义或解释，不同的语言/领域/框架，又有不同的解释。MVC模式（Model–View–Controller）是软件工程[1]中的一种软件架构[2]模式，把软件系统分为三个基本部分：模型（Model）、视图（View）和控制器（Controller）。
当 视图（View）从传统的直接操作GUI对象 变为声明式UI/响应式UI。 会带来两个巨大的变化（MVVM变种）： 1）视图（View）层，对开发者，抹去了GUI的中间状态，复杂度进一步降低 2）MVC的之间的结构关系得到简化和解耦，模型（Model）和控制器（Controller）不再依赖视图（View）。
易用性和可维护性，往往是两个层面的考虑：
•易用性是对过往的归纳总结；•可维护性是对场景需求的进一步的抽象演绎；
​
那么以fish_redux为例：
•State定义 &amp; Reducer函数 对应 Model层•Effect函数对应Controller层•View函数对应View层
fish_redux3.0目的是解决由于客户端/前端应用层软件墒快速上升, 提升软件可维护性, 提高团队协作效率。 客户端/前端 应用层软件复杂度…</span>

                    <span>大力智能技术团队-客户端 都梁人
前言
本文旨在通过实际业务场景阐述如何使用Kotlin Flow解决Android开发中的痛点问题，进而研究如何优雅地使用Flow以及纠正部分典型的使用误区。有关Flow的介绍及其操作符用法可以参考：异步流 - Kotlin 语言中文站，本文不做赘述。基于LiveData+ViewModel的MVVM架构在某些场景下（以横竖屏为典型）存在局限性，本文会顺势介绍适合Android开发的基于Flow/Channel的MVI架构。
背景
大力智能客户端团队在平板端大力一起学App上深度适配了横竖屏场景，将原先基于Rxjava的MVP架构重构成基于LiveData+ViewModel+Kotlin协程的MVVM架构。随着业务场景的复杂度提升，LiveData作为数据的唯一载体似乎渐渐无法担此重任，其中一个痛点就是由于模糊了“状态”和“事件”的界限。LiveData的粘性机制会带来副作用，但这本身并不是LiveData的设计缺陷，而是对它的过度使用。
Kotlin Flow是基于kotlin协程的一套异步数据流框架，可以用于异步返回多个值。kotlin 1.4.0正式版发布时推出了StateFlow和SharedFlow，两者拥有Channel的很多特性，可以看作是将Flow推向台前，将Channel雪藏幕后的一手重要操作。对于新技术新框架，我们不会盲目接入，在经过调研试用一阶段后，发现Flow确实可以为业务开发止痛提效，下文分享这个探索的过程。
痛点一：蹩脚地处理ViewModel和View层通信
发现问题
当屏幕可旋转后，LiveData不好用了？
项目由MVP过渡到MVVM时，其中一个典型的重构手段就是将Presenter中的回调写法改写成在ViewModel中持有LiveData由View层订阅，比如以下场景：

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第3天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
🔥 介绍
本文通过OkHttp+Retrofit+Rxjava+Hilt实现一个网络请求框。
💥 最终代码
        iWanAndroidService.register(map)
                .compose(ResponseTransformer.obtain())
                .subscribe(registerData -&gt; {
                    //请求成功
                }, new ErrorConsumer() {
                    @Override
                    protected void error(ApiException e) {
                        //请求失败
                    }
                });

是不是特别省事。
💥 项目结构

🔥 OkHttp
💥 OkHttp是什么
OkHttp 是一个默认高效的 HTTP 客户端：
HTTP/2 支持允许对同一主机的所有请求共享一个 socket。
连接池减少了请求延迟（如果 HTTP/2 不可用）。
透明 GZIP 可缩小下载大小。
响应缓存完全避免网络重复请求。
网路出现问题后，OkHttp会保持不变，自动从问题中恢复。
官方文档
简单使用+源码解读
OkHttp的时候就不单独介绍了。
缺陷：
网络请求的接口配置繁琐，尤其是需要配置复杂请求body，请求头，参数的时候;
数据解析过程需要用户手动拿到responsbody…</span>

OCR pro 对标点符号的识别真的是差强人意，这其实恰恰是很多人标点符号使用上会出现的问题，所以才会有 pangu.js 的出现，pangu.js 的作用就是优化中英文排版问题，具体规范可见 中文文案排版指北，其中自然包括了中英文之间的空格问题和半角全角标点符号使用。
通过 pangu.js，我们很容易实现对摘录文本和标题的排版优化，我只做了很小的工作，相当于把 pangu.js 引入 Marginnote 中，基础代码修改自 Autotitile，感谢。
使用
本插件默认开启摘录优化，不支持关闭，我认为这是必不可少的过程。
提供按键开启点击卡片优化标题和摘录。但很遗憾，目前提供的 API 点击卡片后只能获取到卡片内第一个笔记以及标题，所以无法优化卡片内所有的摘录和评论，不过你可以点击文章中的摘录来触发。当然，从现在开始，你摘录的所有文字都将得到排版优化。

最后，提供一个批量制作选题题到anki的思路，就是在Mac上对选题的Word文档进行格式调整，在修改上快捷指令的基础上（比如删除开头有关Python脚本的引用，从获得粘贴板开始），就能实现Mac端复制，iPad端粘贴制卡，5秒就能搞定。
以上代码适合大多数题目的制作，总得门槛不算很高，对于快捷指令的修改，我在指令里有说明，我也是代码小白一名，希望能和大家一块交流学习，有兴趣的朋友可以尝试一下。</span>

                    <span>如果一件事物真的流行了起来，就不需要人为地制造「XX 元年」的概念，正如视频自媒体的兴起，以绝对的掌握力，统治了各类内容领域。我们买东西之前要看评测；买完要分享体验视频；旅游要发游记；生活内容要做成 Vlog。
世界被切割成几分钟到十几分钟的片段，代替了它本来的样子。
而从商业的角度来看，如果你错过了博客、微博、微信公众号的黄金时代，你绝对不想再错过短视频所带来的致富机会。即使「元宇宙」的概念已经出现，但它甚至还没到自己的「元年」呢。在肉眼可预见的几年内，视频依旧会是最主流的内容形式。
所以问题来了：

2021 年，该如何成为一名视频创作者？
在创作的过程中，有什么样的前人经验可以借鉴，又有什么样的难处需要面对呢？
在视频创作领域已经高度发展的 2021 年，你还应该成为一名全职视频创作者吗？

如果你对这些话题感兴趣，欢迎参加 11 月 19 日（本周五）20 点举办的「一派·在线沙龙」活动。

「一派·在线沙龙」是由少数派数字工具组策划，一次以语音为载体的科技爱好者聚会。每个人都有空间在这里表达自己的态度，倾听他人的思考。

                    <span>我玩动森已经一年多了，非常肝，目前进度是岛上环境已经达到了五星，博物馆的生物以及艺术品全部收集齐，更新前的大部分 DIY 手册和家具我都拥有了，目前游戏基本上处于一个磨磨蹭蹭岛建的阶段，每天上线 10 分钟左右做完日常任务就下线。虽然还在玩，但是总感觉缺少了最初玩的时候那种激动和新鲜，也缺少了动力。
很多次我都觉得这个游戏就是目前这样了，单机游戏能玩一年多，我已经很满足了。
所以当我看到动森更新的消息之后真的非常非常激动，甚至可以没有看 2.0 版本的更新日志，就直接上手玩了，又非常肝地玩了几天。我想，哪怕我不买 DLC，这个游戏我还能再玩个一年多。
更个性化的岛民服务
一开始就看到西施惠亲切地播报，说我的小岛可以由岛民代表（也就是我）去改变生活条例，这是一项影响岛的重大决策。改变生活条例属于和西施惠的谈话中「关于岛的方针」的内容，办理条例需要花费 20000 铃钱的协助金，一共包括四种条例，分别是优美岛条例、早鸟条例、夜猫条例、经济复苏条例。
西施惠介绍说夜猫条例是一项推迟商店结束营业的时间，熬夜并繁荣岛上夜生活的条例，我毫不犹豫就选了这条。因为我确实喜欢熬夜，而且我忙完可以玩动森的时间大多都超过了岛上商店和服装店的营业时间，无法买买卖商品和衣服。我的一位朋友逐渐淡坑的一个很重要的原因就是，等可以玩动森的时候都是深夜，商店也关门了，小动物也睡觉了，一个人孤零零的很无聊。夜猫条例就很便于我这种睡觉时间偏晚的人，也方便白天没有太多时间玩的社畜。
当然，如果你喜欢早起，可以选择早鸟条例。看到这一点的更新，我真的非常开心，也觉得非常温暖和治愈。这种更新考虑到了不同人的作息时间，可以让大家更自如地选择玩游戏的时间。
另外优美岛条例与岛的景观有关，经济复苏条例与交易有关。处于游戏其他阶段的朋友可以考虑。

除了西施惠那边的更新，我也和狸克聊了聊。狸克告诉我说房间收纳空间又可以扩容啦，…</span>

                    <span>随着可能是今年最后一场线上发布会的落幕，堪称 Apple 年度最重要的新品之一，传闻已久的 14 英寸和 16 英寸 MacBook Pro 终于在上个月与大家正式见面。
新款 MacBook Pro 是 5 年多来变化最大的一代：不仅有着全新的外观设计，M1 Pro / Max 芯片的加入也让预计为期 2 年的 Apple 芯片转移计划，在经过一半的这个时间点，实现了一大步跨越。里里外外全面焕新，也标志着 MacBook Pro 这款产品，开启了「下一个五年」的新世代。
虽然新款 MacBook Pro 的方方面面都带给了我们不少惊喜，比如更强得多的全新 M1 架构芯片、支持 ProMotion 自适应刷新率的 mini-LED 显示屏，以及终于拿掉了 Touch Bar、键程更长的内置妙控键盘等等。但我们也能看到许多妥协与遗憾，比如个人认为实在难以称得上好看、也不支持 Face ID 的「刘海屏」；当然还有无法让人忽视的尺寸与重量。
复古的外观设计，在「妥协」中找到「平衡」
在聊新款 MacBook Pro 全新外观设计之前，不妨先简单回顾一下这款产品的历史。
事实上，MacBook Pro 是一款 2006 年才首次推出的笔记本电脑产品，它的历史在 Mac 系列电脑中实际上相当短暂；在此之前，Apple 推出过 iBook、PowerBook、PowerBook G3 / G4 等多个系列的笔记本电脑产品，而第一台 Mac 电脑，则是 Apple 在 1984 年推出的台式电脑 Macintosh 128K。
第一台 Mac 电脑 Macintosh 128K。1997 年推出的 Macintosh PowerBook 2400c。2005 年推出的最后一款 PowerBook G4。

                    <span>做菜要用到的高温功能家电中，除了灶台、电磁炉等，烤箱现在也成了我家必不可少、几乎天天在使用的电器了，温度时间可调控、无油烟、是做烘焙的必需品，同时用烤箱来做菜的话，也兼有少油、省心、不易焦糊、不用频繁翻面的优势。不过和明火相比起来，烤箱菜的做法还是有些不同，也可以玩出更多花样，本篇文章列出了多道烤箱入门菜谱，蔬菜肉类甜品皆有涵盖，大概按照从易到难的顺序，不过总体来看都是比较简单的，希望对刚刚入手烤箱或是烤箱在家里搁置了很久也不知道怎么用的朋友们有所帮助。
在菜谱内容正式展开之前，先列出烤箱制作中需要常备的物件们：

一台烤箱；适配烤箱尺寸的烤盘、烤网；
可直接放置食物的耐高温烤碗（烤碗不可以直接放在发热管上！一定要垫在烤盘烤网上）；油刷；
烤纸（烤纸的作用是隔离开食物和碗盘起到不粘作用，否则像饼皮一类的在加热过程中会直接和碗底黏在一起，一抓就漏料。烤纸还能防脏，比如漏下去的蛋液在烤制时会在底部成焦疤状，有垫纸的话烤完直接把纸扔掉就行，否则刷渣子要刷好久）；
食品夹；
防烫手套。

另外一些关于烤箱的重点 tips：

每台烤箱的脾气都不太一样，有的温度会偏高或偏低，有的内壁炉温会高于靠近箱门的炉温所以可能会出现摆在里面的食物有点焦了摆靠外面的食物还没熟的情况，这些都需要大家在使用自家烤箱的过程中去熟悉，也建议大家把网上看到的菜谱中标示的温度和时间仅作为参考，根据实际情况进行调整。若还不清楚自家烤箱的温度情况，刚开始可以先在烤制中途蹲在旁边多盯盯，如果发现熟了甚至是有点焦了就提前取出，如果预设时间到了还没熟就再增加时长，或是备一根烤箱温度计。
烤箱使用前都需要预热，建议提前 5–10 分钟先将烤箱调至需要的温度打开进行加热，下文中提到的烤箱使用时长都是预热后、菜品需要在烤箱里呆的时间，不再另外做提示啦，预热很重要很重要很重要，尤其是烘焙来说直接决定了成败，新手们一定记得先预热…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

面对一篇微信公众号的文章，大家可能觉得没什么不寻常，但如果你有看到作者创作时使用的排版工具，便知道一篇文章排版工作的「不易」了。
比如说一篇文章的标题、引言、小标题、段落、引导等等，通常需要在浏览器插件、第三方浏览器等方式逐个插入模板来调整实现。虽然看似方便，但是日复一日重复这些操作，是十分枯燥无味的。
近期因为工作需要我捡起这活，在被「折磨」好一段时间后，发现真的做不来这种重复的工作，于是决定花时间解决它。当然我也并非标新立异，只是觉得一个内容工作者，应该把更多的时间留在内容上，重复的排版工作交给程序执行不是更香吗？
公众号排版样式的自动化
微信公众号的文章并非长篇大论，绝大多数也不是专业文献，所以它最常见的排版样式一般是一级标题、二级标题、正文、引用、图片、加粗等等。
这么一看，很容易联想到专门给写作者用排版语言：Markdown。它的好处是能让你通过键盘就能完成特定的格式排版工作，十分快捷高效。当然了，它也并非复杂的编程语言，可能你只需花 10 分钟就能轻松掌握。
比如说：写一级标题只需在文字前面加一个 # 号，引用段落样式只需在文字前加 &gt; 号，文字加粗则在文字两边分别加两个 * 号：
Markdown演示（少数派的读者都很熟悉了～）
如上图所示，通过 Markdown 写作，我们解决了内容排版样式自动化。但最重要的问题是：微信公众号编辑器不支持 Markdown，我们该如何同步自动化排版好的内容呢？

                    <span>在丹东抗美援朝纪念馆里，陈列着一件特殊的乐器——“两洲三国”胡琴。说是胡琴，但却无比简陋，仔细一看就会发现，琴桶是罐头盒，琴杆是一根木棍，类似绷带的布条将二者简单固定。

这把琴的介绍词是这样的：“在炮火纷飞的战场上，志愿军战士充分发扬革命乐观主义精神，在战斗间隙开展各种娱乐活动。激烈的战斗过后，志愿军战士利用缴获的美军罐头盒、朝鲜的木材和中国的马尾制作成这把胡琴。战士们给它起名叫‘两洲三国’胡琴。‘两洲’是亚洲和美洲，‘三国’是中国、朝鲜和美国。”
我难以想象，这是怎样一种精神，使得这把琴在炮火连天的战场上、在昏暗狭窄的坑道中发出悠扬的琴声。我不禁为志愿军战士革命乐观主义和革命浪漫主义精神所震撼。
而这，仅仅是中国人民志愿军宣传文化工作的一个剪影。
其实，残酷的战争与灿烂的文化并非“水火不容”。恰恰相反，越是激烈艰苦的战争环境，越需要丰富的文化生活鼓舞斗志。

入朝作战初期，由于志愿军防空力量较为薄弱，白天战士们只能躲在工事里，等待黑夜再进行战斗。在漫长的备战时间里，战士们充分发挥想象力和创造力，自娱自乐地开展了各具特色的文艺活动。如看到东北籍的战士唱起“二人转”，其他地方入伍的战士也争相哼起了自己家乡的小调。有的战士在行军中即兴作诗：“十一号汽车有力气，要带很多好东西，能爬山，能过河，一天要开几十里。”另外，前线的志愿军指战员们在战斗的间隙，以自己的亲身体验为基础创造了许多优秀的战地文艺作品，如歌曲《志愿军战歌》《来一个歼敌大竞赛》，说唱《侦察英雄韩启发》《阵地之家》，小说《突破临津江》等都是其中的代表。
这些志愿军战士自主创作的文艺作品，不仅形象地反映了运动战的特点，同时也洋溢着积极向上的革命乐观主义精神。
除了战士们的自娱自乐，志愿军还组织了专业的文艺演出队伍，爬山岭、进坑道，与志愿军基层指战员一起开展丰富多彩的文化活动

                    <span>Hello all, it&#x27;s been too long but this is the time to tell you about GreyOS!
GreyOS is an open source Meta-OS (nothing related to metaverse, facebook, etc.). I have been developing this since 2013.
GreyOS introduces the new computing era with the Cloud Computer (CC), which is always on, available, fast and secure.
Please check the details at https://github.com/g0d/GreyOS
I am looking for contributors, developers and testers to do so much more, create new integrated apps and reshape the computing landscape into something fresh!</span>

                    <span>Occasionally you might want to rename an AWS S3 bucket you are managing with Terraform. However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.
To avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.
In this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:
resource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {
    bucket &#x3D; “old-name”
}

and you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.
Firstly, we’ll need to create a new bucket. You can do this us…</span>

                    <span>Tailwind CSS comes with &quot;an opinionated set of base styles&quot; called Preflight. A helpful CSS reset built on top of modern-normalize.
Margins, headings, lists, and many others get stripped from their defaults. Thus, achieving cross-browser consistency and an easier adaptation of your design system.
It all sounds helpful, until you need those defaults to style a markdown post.
In comes @tailwindcss/typography, a plugin with sensible typographic styles. It adds a set of prose classes to style content blocks like the one you are reading.
You can install it via npm or yarn:
# Using npm
npm install @tailwindcss/typography

# Using Yarn
yarn add @tailwindcss/typography

Then add the plugin to your tailwind.config.js file:
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports &#x3D; {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require(&#x27;@tailwindcss/typography&#x27;),
    // ...
  ],
}

Finally, you can use the prose class to apply the markdown styling:

  
Welcome to Mars!
  
    Although life on Mars is perfect in every single way, you might have some questions.
  
  
    Of course there’s air! Just don’t breathe it. And, with the crazy gravity situation, everyone can dunk!
  
  


More information about the prose class and its modifiers can be found at the repository.</span>

                    <span>As Docker usage has grown, Docker Compose has become the leader in running multi-service applications locally. Unfortunately, as your application expands and more services must communicate, we’ve found authoring these Compose files can become arduous, time consuming, and mistake prone. We want to make writing Compose files with volumes, ports, and multiple services much easier. 
Today, we’d like to announce the Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code. That’s right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense, Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: 
IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image)

Right-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) 
YAML Syntax Validation 
Hyperlinks for Docker Images 
In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
There are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:
More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation 
… and much more! 
We love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.</span>

This article is based on that presentation. So, let&#x27;s talk about cloud native development and its impact on organisations. Most of my clients are large insurance or financial companies. And the are considering a migration to the cloud. And they are asking for help. The discussions are either based on FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) or snake-oil.

It is not surprising that the truth lies in between.
This is the first of a two part series. Each introduces things we learnt while moving companies into the public cloud.  I focus on culture and organisation. Not because tech is boring. Rather most discussions focus on technology and …</span>

I&#x27;ve used this easy way for a horizontal scroll a lot and I want to share the code with you: ✌️
HTML

  

    

    

  


.horizonal-wrapper {
   height: 100vh;
   width: 100%;
   overflow-y: scroll;
}

.horizonal-content {
   width: max-content;
}

.content-1,
.content-2,
.content-3 {
  width: 50vw;
  height: 100vh;
  float: left;
  border: 1px solid;
}

JS
$(&#x27;.horizonal-wrapper&#x27;).on(&#x27;wheel&#x27;, function(e){

   e.preventDefault();
   $(this).scrollLeft($(this).scrollLeft() + e.originalEvent.deltaY);

});

When I first got started in Tech, I again felt like I needed a mentor, but being remote and mostly autonomous, I had no idea where to find one. Instead of throwing my hands up and hoping for the best, I decided to break down why I was feeling that way and think of creative ways to get similar results.

Often we’re looking for some mythical senior developer or lead architect somewhere to tell us the one thing we need to learn or build that’s going to rocket us to a FAANG job (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), a more senior position, or Twitch stardom.

                    <span>An introduction on how to use useEffect Hook in a React application



  
  
  What is a useEffect Hook?




  
  
  TLDR


React useEffect is an alternative to the &quot;old&quot; class lifecycle methods/hooks.
It can be used to manage side effects, such as network requests, or to run a piece of code when the component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.
Prior to React v16.8, we can only enable a component
lifecycle methods.
useEffect





useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; { //(1) declaration
  // (2)effect
  return () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // (3)cleanup 
  }
}, /* (4)dependency array */)

We can declare an effect by calling either React.useEffect or useEffect


effect is the function that will be called when the component is mounted
OR when the dependency array changes.
cleanup is the function that will be called when the effect…</span>

                    <span>หลังจากลง Docker บน Ubuntu แล้วนั่นเราจะใช้งานมันได้เราต้องใช้สิทธิ์ root ซึ่งต้องสั่ง docker โดยใช้ sudo เช่น sudo docker ps
แต่ถ้าเราอยากสั่งโดยไม่ต้องใช้ sudo ก็สามารถทำได้โดยเพิ่ม user ของเราเข้าไปใช้ usergroup ที่ชื่อว่า docker ด้วยคำสั่งแบบนี้
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

หลังจากนั้น logout แล้ว login อีกที (ถ้าไม่ได้ก็จัดการ restart OS อีกรอบ) เราก็สามารถสั่งคำสั่ง docker ด้วย user เราเองโดยไม่ต้องใช้สิทธิ์ root ผ่าน sudo อีกแล้ว เช่น
docker run hello-world

                    <span>The Beginning


Today I am beginning the 100 Days of Code Challenge. This challenge only asks that you code for one hour a day, every day, for 100 days. I&#x27;ve been mostly sticking to this for a couple months anyway, but I want to officially commit to it as a way to force myself to keep on track and log my progress.
Speaking of logging my progress, I think I&#x27;ll make posts here every 10 days detailing what I&#x27;ve been up to and what I&#x27;ve learned. I&#x27;m in the midst of the Ruby Path at The Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I&#x27;ve been working on building a game of Mastermind, which is easily the most complicated thing I&#x27;ve had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 
Since this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I&#x27;m visiting my family back home. But other than that, I plan to keep on schedule barring some intense illness or emergency. Looking forward to expanding my skills and getting on a new career path 💯</span>

                    <span>How to map a React class life cycle methods/hooks to useEffect



  
  
  Common class lifecycle methods





// happens as soon as your component is mounted
componentDidMount() {}

// happens as soon as the updating begin
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {}

// for certain performance optimizations
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {}

// happens just before the component unmounts
componentWillUnmount() {}
}

Here are basic templates to convert a class lifecycle method to a useEffect hook:
Create an empty dependency array and pass it to the useEffect hook.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // code to run when the component is mounted 

  // Make sure this is empty to ensure hook will only run once
}, [])

                    <span>Will I have to be on call?
In the last hour of Koan’s on-site interview we turn the tables and invite candidates to interview our hiring team. At face value it’s a chance to answer any open questions we haven’t answered earlier in the process. It’s also a subtle way to introspect on our own hiring process — after three rounds of interviews and side-channel conversations with the hiring manager, what have we missed? What’s on candidates’ minds? Can we address it earlier in the process?
So, you asked, will I have to be on call?
The middle of the night pager rings? The panicked investigations? Remediation, write-ups, post-mortems?
Patrick Collison’s been there, too:
And that&#x27;s how I ruined ducks for myself.

                    <span>TLDR: Closure is the concept of storing a function and its environment together.  When you create a function, it stores the functions local environment and its outer environment together.  If you are ever confused about what value will be present, understand what value existed when the function scope was created!
If you were to look up what a closure is, Wikipedia&#x27;s definition has this to say in the first two lines:
In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. 
That is a bit of a dense definition, but its not a complex as it seems at first glance!  This article aims to …</span>

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第16天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
前言
目前移动端跨平台最热的两门技术 Flutter 和 React Native 都非常受欢迎。这两门技术到底该入坑哪一门，我们来根据数据对比及分析来看该如何选择 （只有菜鸟才做选择题，大神会说两个我都要）。
Round 1：谁在背书
两门技术背后都有巨头背书，一个是母公司更过名字的Google，一个是刚刚更名为 Meta 的 Facebook。两个巨头在互联网界是“景行行止，高山仰止”的角色。
作为谷歌的亲儿子，Flutter 诞生于2017年，一开始是提供了移动端的 SDK，通过声明式的组件配置和绝杀技 —— 抹平平台UI差异性渲染引擎 Skia，在跨平台开发界一下子搞得风生水起。 而最近的2.0更是生猛，直接宣布进军 Web、桌面客户端（Windows，Mac OS 和 Linux）和移动端，不得不让人感叹一声“后生可畏”。Flutter使用的 Dart 语言也是编译型的面向对象高级语言，因此执行速度会更快。下面是 Flutter 的一些优点：
免费并且开源，而且社区的开源插件也已经十分丰富。
基于响应式编程的架构设计使得代码更好维护。
基于 Widget 的渲染框架设计，使得 Flutter 应用能够开发出非常漂亮的 UI 界面和提供优秀的用户体验。
React Native 也是一个跨平台的App 开发平台，在2015年的时候被 Facebook 引入。React Native 主要使用 JavaScript 语言进行开发，同样是一套代码可以编译成不同平台的应用。下面是 React Native 的一些特性：
支持热重载，可以加速开发调试过程。
使用当前非常流行的 JavaScript 语言开发，使用 J…</span>

                    <span>MarginNote的功能无疑是强大的，在新推出的 子脑图 功能和 标题链接 等功能的加持下，脑图可以无限层级的延伸、串联，打造个人知识库的能力已经初步显现。然而在实际体验下，我认为这种“串联”仍然是不完整的，仍然有不少“割裂感”，而且这种“割裂感”很多时候导致的后果是交互的不自然，让很多操作不那么自然、顺手，从而分散注意力，导致关注重点不在于内容、而是部分分散到了完成操作上，影响实际投入学习的效率。而这点实际上能带来的问题是很大的。知识管理、知识库打造实在是一个太大的话题，个人也仅是凭自己的经验所做的思考，在近期将琐碎的所思形诸笔墨。以下是个人一些不成熟的见解，在短短的文章里难以完全表述出来，还希望后续可以有更多和官方交流的机会。
不得不说，MarginNote在软件的设计上，对于如何获取、学习、积累知识，甚至是主动创造知识上是有深刻的理解的，随着使用时间不断深入我越发佩服MarginNote的设计哲学之富有深意。这篇文章主要结合个人使用感受讨论学习、积累知识、打造知识库的方面MN可以优化的地方。
个人使用MarginNote大致有两种场景（当然本人是人文学科的专业，也许与理科不同，纯属个人感受）：一种是零散的、不需要进行结构化的，另一种是知识型的、需要逐步构建一个知识体系的。两种场景的区分往往是和学习内容相关的。例如单纯的学习外语，那么把单词、释义、原文中出现这个单词的句子做成卡片，以便后续导入卡片组/Anki复习即可，不需要专门的整理脑图。例如单纯的阅读文学作品，通常没有或者不需要一个明确的框架，仅需要品读、批注、摘录即可，依托MarginNote的定位跳转功能，方便回溯到摘录的句子所在的原文语境，依托科学的算法也更容易记忆摘录语句。而和专业相关的理论、教程等等，具有一个清晰的框架，则适合深入研究、需要搭建知识框架和体系。当然这个区分只是相对的，当然是可以对外语词汇进…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 10 月 24 日，Android 玩机圈内无人不知的玩机工具 Magisk 突然有了新动态：其开发者 John Wu 更新了一条 推文，宣布推出全新的 Magisk 金丝雀（canary）版本。它虽然并非正式版，但给玩机圈带来的喜悦却胜过以往任何一个版本。
这种喜悦近似于久旱逢甘霖。
时间回到 21 年 5 月，Magisk 开发者 John Wu 通过社交平台透露自己即将加入 Google，负责 Android 平台的安全工作。John Wu 此前有在 Apple 的实习经历，对 Android 安全领域也颇为熟悉，Google 择才而用、Wu 求仁得仁，这本来是值得庆祝的事。但在他公布自己获得新工作的 推文 下，除了寥寥的几则祝福，大多数关注者都在询问另外一个问题 —— Magisk 将何去何从？
Twitter @topjohnwu
Magisk 可以获取设备的 root 权限，凭借其独特的模块挂载方式，在 Xposed 等老牌玩机工具陷入泥潭之际 Magisk 反倒跟随 Android 系统渡过了好几个大版本更新，以其广泛的设备兼容性和强大的模块生态逐渐成为每一个 Android 玩家的必备工具。
因此开发者 John Wu 在 Magisk 上做的工作一直以来也如同攻向 Android 和 Google 服务的一把长矛，在 Google 的新职位，却又赋予了他 Android 平台安全持盾人的全新身份。「以子之矛陷子之盾」的戏话会在现实发生吗？作为 Google 人，Wu 有访问大部分公司代码的权限，Google 会允许 John Wu 继续开发 Magisk 吗？
State of Magisk: 2021
正如很多人所预料的那样，Magisk 最初的情况并不乐观。
对于网友的问题，Wu 先是回复称自己的 Magisk 开发不会受影响，不久却删除…</span>

和终端打过交道的读者应该对每次输入命令前都会出现的提示符（Prompt）不陌生，它们可以承载诸如当前位置、用户名等有用的信息。不管是出于美观还是实用的目的，自定义提示符都能给终端那枯燥的黑白界面添一抹色彩。
本文的主角 Oh my posh 正是这样一款终端 Prompt 个性化工具，虽然肇始于同类工具 Oh My Zsh，但当更新到 5.0 版本时，重新设计的 Oh my posh 已经摆脱平台的桎梏，支持了 Windows、GNU/Linux（WSL）、macOS 三个系统上的 PowerShell、bash、zsh 等终端。
下文将展示 Oh my posh 的效果，然后介绍它在不同系统和终端上的安装配置方式。
效果
Oh my posh 预置了数十款主题，项目官网有这些主题的 预览。安装并配置好工具后，打开终端即可看到效果。其中既有以文字为主的简约主题，例如 wopian、material：
wopianmaterial
也有辅以彩色背景和字体的醒目主题，例如 jandedobbeleer 和 craver：
jandedobbeleercraver
若不满意现有的主题，工具也支持加载自定义主题，其语法相较于 PowerShell 等终端默认提供的语法要简单不少。而除了能讨好用户的视觉，Oh my posh 的一些主题增加的 Git 项目状态预览等信息也比较实用。
安装
主题多姿多彩并没有让 Oh my posh 的安装变得复杂。它在各个平台上的安装方式流程是大致一致的，分为三步：按需安装字体 &gt; 安装 Oh my posh &gt; 修…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。

在过去一年里，我读了很多 PKM（个人知识管理）有关的书籍和文章，并依据学习到的知识。结合自己的阅读需求，调整我的阅读工作流。
随着阅读内容的变化，新工具的出现，我的阅读工作流也在不断更新迭代。写这篇文章，是为了分享在 2021 年底这个时间点，我在用的阅读工作流。
开门见山，直接上图：

我把我的阅读工作流，分为了七步：
信息源-&gt;稍后阅读-&gt;划线批注-&gt;临时笔记-&gt;永久笔记（知识库）-&gt;回顾系统-&gt;创作输出
文章内容将对每一步使用的方法和工具进行介绍：
01 信息源
我日常阅读的内容 ，包括文章、书籍和动态。
文章
文章是我日常读的最多的阅读材料，我会从 Newsletter、公众号、blogger 或是朋友推荐的文章中筛选出我感兴趣的文章进行阅读。
在我关注的领域（效率工具、互联网、商业），我会保证我的信息源是最优质的。每两周我也会在我阅读的文章中，挑选出有用或有趣的文章，在 我的 Newsletter《草稿拾遗》中推荐。如果你也对这些领域感兴趣，可以关注我的公众号或将这份 Newsletter 订阅到你的邮箱。
书籍
书籍相较于文章，内容更加系统。想要系统地学习一个领域，离不开阅读书籍。
阅读非虚构类的书籍时，我追求的是高效阅读和记录，会优先选择电子书，便于记笔记和存档；阅读非虚构类书籍，如散文或是小说时，我则会选择纸质书更加容易沉浸在作者构建的世界中，享受阅读的乐趣。
动态
除了文章与书籍，推特/即刻/微博/豆瓣等社交媒体上，还有许多 KOC/KOL 的动态也值得一读。
动态的篇幅或许非常短，却是作者思想的浓缩，且实时性…</span>

Google Pixel 6/Pro 现已支持通过摄像头检测心率及呼吸频率
Google 于 11 月 15 日向 向 Pixel 6 和 Pixel 6 Pro 用户的 Goggle Fit 健康管理软件推送了两项新功能，分别为让用户在无需佩戴智能手表等可穿戴设别的情况下使用手机后置摄像头，通过识别用户食指上的细微变化来检测用户的心率，以及通过手机前置摄像头，通过检测用户的胸腔的起伏情况以获取用户的呼吸频率。据悉用户在打开新版 Google Fit 后，从页面顶部健康信息区域向下滑动到「发现」区域，找到「检查心率」功能卡片，点击卡片上的「开始」按钮，并将食指触碰后置摄像头即可开始心率监测。据悉在外界光线充足的情况下，心率检测的准确性会非常高，而在较暗的地方，最后的结果会有大约 30 bpm 的偏差。来源

                    <span>九阴真经下卷，论文实操。
此文用于分享一下一个老博士的科学写作经验。本博士写作水平只能说是将将及格，因此不敢舔着脸好为人师，此文仅当做一种信息交流，以供后来者扬弃。场面话言尽于此，下面我将正式从头到尾讲讲我的心得。
哲学原则
最初尝试科学写作的人，也大致了解文章分为abstract, introduction, related works, approaches, experiments, (optional) applications, conclusion 这几章。但是具体写起来，科研小白们，包括我自己一开始，都是一样无从下手的。经过这么多年混下来，终于初悟此道。
一个科研小白，最常用的思维是线性而非层次化的。因此，他对于项目的理解往往是我干了A所以有a，然后干了B所以有b，然后我又干了CDE，最后我的系统是ABCDE，发现厉害了。然后谈related work，ABCDE是related work，了事了。对，你是厉害了和了事了，但听者什么也没学到。一个好的论文，原则是用最少的文字最精准的传达关于项目的知识。
小白可能不服气——我都说了ABCDE了，该说的都说了，不然你让我怎么描述知识呀？！这时，我极其想给他推荐几篇柏拉图和亚里士多德的作品，不过我就简单搬运一下：

Theaetetus, 知识是正确的见解加与其他易混淆事物差异的解释。
Philebus/Timaeus，无限的多是一种混沌，有限的一是美的。
Statesman，本质的划分导致精确的概念的讨论。
Categories，普遍的还是个例的，必然的还是偶然的？
Prior Analytics, 三段论。
Posterior Analytics（尚在写作中），证明是从在先的必然的结论出发的三段论。定义是本源实体的最先描述。

由此，ABCDE模式的几个显著缺陷就明了了。一方面，这虽然详述了你的方案，但读者并不知…</span>

                    <span>First, let’s talk about a Linear Equation. A linear equation consists of variables, the only restriction is that each variable can have a power of 1. I.e there can be no variable with a power of 2 or greater.

Linear Programming consists of two parts. The objective function is a linear equation and a set of constraints. The objective function or the linear equation will either have to be maximized or minimized.
Eg: Consider a bookseller has 3 types of books (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). The Physics Book makes a profit of 10\$, Chemistry makes a profit of 5\$ and Biology makes a profit of 2\$. If we wanted to write a equation for the total profit it would look something like below

                    <span>Team building for remote teams is a tricky subject, especially for developer teams.  Often, software engineer team members aren&#x27;t keen on traditional team-building activities such as, well, socialising in person over drinks, playing rounders or driving go karts.
If engineers are already spending their days in front of a screen, it might seem an interesting idea, but go with it for a second... what about an online escape room where the team has to hack, code and puzzle their way out?
I built /dev/esc to give dev teams a challenging, geeky way to do what they do in their day jobs.  Only without JIRA, requirements, specifications, meetings, managers.  It&#x27;s unashamedly nerdy - my premise is that programmers will enjoy the reward of cracking a team game in about an hour, especially if the subject matter is code, data or APIs.
I&#x27;d love to hear from you in the comments.  Am I onto a good idea here?  What feedback do you have for me?
Have you been involved in team-building activities and seen successful ideas?  Or unsuccessful attempts?  I think developer teams are underserved by traditional off-site activities and would love to learn more from your experiences.</span>

                    <span>My week started with way more work than expected.
I started today off by finishing the JS Basics portion of FreeCodeCamp. These lessons seem to be very well structured, so I&#x27;m going to continue with this course until I complete it.
Today I started the process of linting my entire project with ESLint (AirBnB rules). While the linting itself was not a problem, I ran into some serious dependency tree errors and really got lost in the forest of it. Solving these errors was a really long winded process and it ate up a lot of the time I had set aside for working. In the future, I will need to be much more careful when setting dependencies; I didn&#x27;t realize how convoluted it could get to fix.
As is usual, Tuesday is my busiest day of the week and this Tuesday will be no exception. My plans are to continue with FreeCodeCamp&#x27;s tutorials and any spare time I get to work on my project will be a blessing.
Dealing with dependencies in React. I need to learn more about the config files, especially package.json and the different ways I can go about solving dependency errors. If others hadn&#x27;t run into the same issues as I, I really don&#x27;t know how I would have solved my dependency problems today.

In this article, we&#x27;ll build a distributed app in the Redwood framework that handles video data. We&#x27;ll make a smart contract to handle our blockchain interactions. Then we&#x27;ll set up the Redwood distributed app that will work with the blockchain.
A DApp is very similar to a regular app. The only difference is that the back-end runs on a decentralized network instead of a central server that might host APIs or other services. It uses the Ethereum blockchain to store data and it …</span>

The last 2-3 weeks I have been working on Pull Requests for my Open Source class at Seneca College. Previously, during Hacktoberfest I contributed to a tool called toad-scheduler which is an in-memory NodeJS scheduling tool.
In this tool, I helped fix a bug about setInterval() limit throwing an error with anything over than 24.5 days. During this PR, I had to write a test using Jest framework to handle the long intervals and make sure it was firing the task correctly.
For my next PR, I wanted to work on the tool again with Igor Savin. I asked him what I could do to help this time around. One of the options he mentioned was adding Browser based testing using Headless Chrome.

今天中国谷歌开发者大会线上如期举行，其中主要包含了 Android 、TF、Play、AR、Flutter 等相关的内容，本篇主要介绍主会场的部分内容。
本次大会看起来基本都是录播的感觉，我比较关心 Android 和 Flutter 的内容。
Android
Android 12 的发布主要在如下三方面进行了优化调整：用户界面、性能、隐私。

关于用户界面谷歌提供了 Material You 的设计，可以说是  Material Design 的 V3 模式。
从我个人看，这个对我们国内影响不大，毕竟大部分 App 都不遵循这个设计规范····

Android 12 同时更注重多种设备屏幕的适配，比如 WPS 就兼容了折叠屏的工作模式。

关于 MAD 相信大家也不陌生，Modern Android Development，谷歌开发者公众号今年就推送了一些列的 MAD Skills 的文章，其中就包含 Jetpack 常见的 Navigatoin、WorkManager、Room、DataStore、Macrobenchmark 等等的内容。

还有针对 Andorid Wear 的介绍和合作品牌介绍。

Play
Google Play 这次最主要是介绍了 Data safety section 相关，也是后续上架会慢慢开始强制性要求的内容。

我在《对开发者而言《个人信息保护法》更新究竟是什么？如何应对适配？》就有对这部分内容进行过介绍。

AR
更方便的和更强大的 ARCore SDK，可以更便捷地调用，不出意外蹭了一波元宇宙的热度。


TensorFlow
举例国内外使用 TensorFlow 的例子：
知衣 App 使用它让用户可以在线上使用衣服
58同城使用它做车牌识别和车型等。

Web
更加注重隐私权限的沙盒。

介绍 WebAssembly 能更好接入 C++ 代码，让渲染更加流畅和优秀。


PWA 可以更方便同步用户的操作，比如打开文件。


Flutter
官方介绍 Flutter 已经成为了最大的跨平台开发框架，谷歌 Play 上超过 350,000  App 使用 Flutter 。

例如字节跳动就是最大的 Flutter 应用开发商之一，它名下就有 &gt;70 款 app 使用了 Flutter 开发。

腾讯不只在微信和企业微信手机端使用了 Flutter ，在 PC 端也开始使用 Flutter 支持，甚至在游戏领域。


官方接收的反馈， Flutter 提高了 30% 的生产力，近期的版本主要在性能，可用性和插件方面进行了更新。


对于 Flutter Web 而言，CanvasKit 渲染器已经支持稳定版发布了，接下来 Flutter 将逐步缩小 App 和 Web 之间的差异。


比如 Web 的摄像头插件已经得到支持。

PC 端依然还是 beta 阶段，不过可以在 stable 分支通过配置使用，目前还是处于继续优化的阶段。

PC 端的改建主要是在 文本编辑、鼠标键盘、滚动和无障碍这四个方面进行改进，另外之前介绍过的 ubuntu 就默认开始支持 Flutter 了。



Flutter 广告插件的发布。

支持导入第三方包的 dart pad 现在可以 beta 试用，官方也推荐了一些状态管理的包，比如：provider、flutter_bolc、rivepod。



Flutter 官方网站的改版，更多资源和例子的官网。
官网现在还提供 Flutter 学徒的免费教程哦：flutter.dev


总的来说这次大会主会场的内容不多，并且基本上看起来都是录制的画面，分会场也是开放了录制的视频，可以重播，有需要的可以直接查看：  https://developersummit.googlecnapps.cn</span>

                    <span>忍不了了
最近在手机上看天气的时候发现一堆广告，烦得要死，一个天气app，我想要的只是查看下天气，结果钢筋天气应用就给我来个开屏广告，好家伙，原来我这么喜欢广告吗？？？开屏广告就不说了，我忍了，因为很多应用都有开屏广告；但是进来天气页面尽然还是一堆广告，误触就会跳转别的应用，这也不说了，我也忍了；你一个天气应用有一堆资讯我还忍了！最让我忍不了的是竟然还有 VIP ？？？我TM看个天气还要开个VIP？？？实在是忍不了了，自己写一个吧，正好可以多练练Compose，而且自己写的天气绝对没有广告，也不会乱下载东西，也不会胡乱跳别的应用，比如某多多、某宝等等。。
说干就干，找了一圈感觉和风天气还挺好，之前也使用过他们的api，那就用和风天气吧。
废话不多说，先来看下项目的实现好的样式吧：



























其实上面的图并没有完整展示出项目的全部，项目中还适配了横屏、多语言、深色模式、LCE展示等等，为了增加用户体验，项目中还使用了Room、Hilt、Lottie等等依赖库，大家项目中想要的都有。
配置相关账号
进入和风天气的官网：https://console.qweather.com/
没有账号的可以注册一个账号，然后进入控制台，选择应用管理谋模块：

然后点击创建应用：

这里选择免费开发版即可，咱们个人使用的话用不了多少的，之后输入天气数据应用的名称：

然后点击下一步，选择KEY的类型：

毫无疑问这里选择Android SDK，下一步来填写应用的包名等信息：

最后点击创建就创建成功了：

接下来咱们创建一个空的项目重新开始，这里需要注意，创建新项目的时候要选择Empty Compose Activity：

下面一步一步创建应用就行了。对了，还有一点需要注意：包名要和上面填写的一致。
创建好项目之后需要创建一个Application，…</span>

                    <span>简介
我基于stackedit的markdown编辑器制作了这款插件，由于官方markdown插件非常不友好，存在公式无法正确识别等一些问题，所以制作了这款插件，补充官方插件的不足。stackedit是采用了mermaid、katex引擎，满足一部分人对mermaid的需求。（Mermaid 是一个用于画流程图、状态图、时序图、甘特图的库，使用 JS 进行本地渲染，广泛集成于许多 Markdown 编辑器中。)
myMarkDown的使用效果
公式
与官方markdown插件不同，$输入你的公式$两个美元符号之间是内联公式，$$你的公式$$是块公式。
流程图
本款markdown插件采用mermaid引擎，所以想制作流程图请学习使用mermaid。
表格
与官方的markdown插件一样。
痛点需求
官方的markdown插件存在很多bug，目前这款stackedit还没发现bug；
由于窗口大小的限制，所以不同于官方markdown插件将左边为输入区，右边为preview，而是采用了整个窗口都为输入区，需要查看preview时点击一个按钮即可查看。

不容错过的新 App
虽然少数派一直在为大家发发现和介绍各平台上的优质 App，但仍有不少设计、功能、交互、体验都非常优秀的 App，还没有被我们发掘和介绍。它们可能是一款老 App，也可能是近期上架的新 App，我们会在这里介绍给你。
Automa：将繁琐的网页操作自动化

平台：Chrome
关键词：浏览器、标签页、自动化

@化学心情下2：脚本语言的好处在于可以将一些需要反复操作的过程进行自动化操作，只需要编写好相关的运行模式，接下来的事情就让脚本来跑就行。相比用来直接开发成一款程序，这种基于脚本的自动化操作即具有一定的灵活性，同时还有很高的效率。
其实这和 iOS / macOS 上的快捷指令如出一辙，只不过快捷指令在编写指令时类似现在流行的「低代码」平台——通过可视化的步骤创建来实现脚本程序的编写。不过快捷指令往往都是系统层级的工具，如果我想自动化操作网页，那么下面这款名为 Automa 的浏览器扩展可能会更为实用。

简单来说，在 Automa 编写各种自动运行的指令的形式结合来「快捷指令」以及低代码的平台。比如我想要创建一个「一键搜索少数派」的自动化命令，那么首先打开 Automa 的仪表盘页面，点击右上方的「New workflow」来创建一个自动化任务。

之后点击这个脚本进入到编辑页面中，将左侧业务块中找到「New tab」拖入到右侧的编辑区域中，然后将它和最初触发模块「Trigger」用…</span>

                    <span>对于女生而言，一年四季都必不可少的衣物，除了跟男生一样的必需品内裤外，内衣的地位也是当仁不让。而且内衣的舒适度对于女性身体体验上也是占据着非常大的比重。
作为一个运动爱好者的女生代表，尝试过修身养性的「慢」运动瑜伽，也接触过挥汗淋漓的拳击和 MMA，当然还有我的最爱——力量训练和举铁。细数这些不同种类的运动场景，我们总被提醒「要穿运动服」，但其实真正最必不可缺的就是女性运动内衣。
有了它，就可以在畅快淋漓（或痛苦）运动时不用去顾忌身体上的「别扭」。

为什么需要运动内衣
运动内衣和普通内衣的穿着目的其实是不同的，普通内衣更多是为了「保护基础形体」，即普通内衣只是在水平方向向拖住胸部，防止胸部下垂或外扩，部分内衣可达到收缩聚拢效果，在穿衣搭配上更多变。
而运动内衣因其搭配场景的需求，更多作用于对抗活动过程中的地心引力。因为在运动过程中，不管是瑜伽的稳固核心、猫式、上犬式还是长跑过程中的幅度摆臂等，女性胸部都会因其自身结构的独特性而产生晃动。这点相信大家在中学上体育课时就有所感受，跑 800 米甚至是立定跳远都会造成胸部在普通内衣内的来回抖动。
从支撑性角度来看，普通内衣更讲究修饰胸形、聚拢、美观，更偏向日常生活场景。而运动内衣的主要优势就是强支撑和固定性，这在运动场景上是高度匹配的。减少胸部晃动，既可以对身体减少一定程度的伤害，也可以避免公共场合的形体尴尬。
同时，运动内衣因为要满足运动场景的各类需求，比如出汗量大、运动幅度大，尤其是在锁骨、胸口和腋下很容易堆积汗水，所以在物料材质的选择上一般会看重透气性和可延展性。同时在肩带宽窄度和下胸围包边材质上都会进行专门的处理，保证后期穿戴的稳定和亲肤度。
运动时穿普通内衣难道就不能锻炼了吗？
胸部在人体内部构造中更接近流体的状态（不管大小）。查阅资料显示，女生跑步时胸部晃动呈现出 ∞ 形，即使是一个 A Cup 的女生，在没有运动内…</span>

                    <span>过去的十年间，我们听音乐的方式也发生了很大的变化：坚持转录、下载、手动整理归类音乐文件然后使用播放器和手机本地播放的人越来越少，选择 QQ 音乐、网易云、Spotify、Apple Music 等流媒体音乐服务的人越来越多。
不过由于各种原因，流媒体音乐服务依然难以替代本地曲库在音乐发烧友心中的地位。毕竟不用为了听不同音乐人的作品同时安装多个 App 并在其间来回切换，也不用怀揣自己的歌单会不会因为版权忽然「变灰」的那份忐忑。
如果你依然坚守着本地播放这种「古早」的听歌方式，喜欢将喜爱的作品收藏至本地而非云端，选对本地音乐播放器则可以说是决定整个听歌体验的最为关键的一环。好在 Android 平台从来不缺优秀的本地音乐播放器，在 Phonograph 几乎停更、PowerAMP 颜值始终捡不起来的 2021 年，我们又有哪些值得一试的新选择呢？

Stellio：全面定制你的听音风格
表面看起来界面简洁清爽的 Stellio，背后却有着较为复杂多样的交互操作逻辑，比如在主界面右滑显示侧边栏、从底部播放栏连续上划依次进入「正在播放」页与播放清单页、在「正在播放」页按钮之外的任意位置长按联网搜索与修改专辑图、双击任意位置联网搜索与修改歌词等等操作均不是那么的直观，刚上手使用时可能会令人感到无所适从。
Stellio 当然深知这个问题，因此在初次使用时，它会在每个界面中以浮窗的形式展示详细的操作指引，告诉用户在各个界面、按钮上滑动、长按、双击分别能实现什么功能。经过一段时间的频繁使用形成习惯后操作效率还是比较高的，若有遗忘也能重新查看操作指引。

均衡器是 Stellio 的一个重头功能，它支持 12 个频段的手动调整以及内置的 16 种预设音效模式，可以更加精细化地来调节歌曲的音乐试听风格。另外它还提供了增益控制功能，可以手动来增强歌曲中的高、中、低音，或是控…</span>

我主业是程序员，最近做了床蚕丝被。
抱着严谨求真的态度，我查阅了 8 本丝绸与纺织领域的教材及近 100 篇纺织领域论文、期刊文献。
结论是：蚕丝被确实很好，蚕丝被行业确实很烂。

我是个独立开发者。就是那种自己做产品、画设计稿、写代码，然后把做好的 App 放到苹果或安卓应用商店里售卖的人。有点像四惠东早上卖煎饼果子的，一个人热气腾腾的活得像一支队伍。
6 个月前，我决定做一床蚕丝被。因为我想买一床很好的蚕丝被，又不愿意花不明不白的钱。多年的程序员工作经验告诉我，学习轮子最快的方式就是自己造个轮子。于是我就花半年时间做了一床非常好的蚕丝被，叫「云惹」。
当然，还有一个更重要的原因是我开发的 App 不怎么赚钱（虽然很优秀），我想卖被子补贴家用。
的确好用么
随便搜索下蚕丝被，就会得到满屏的彩虹屁。高频词汇是纤维皇后、人体第二肌肤、贴身保暖、控温透气、富含 18 种氨基酸、美容养颜。
抛开云山雾罩的玄学语言，科学的角度看，关系到一床被子舒适度的关键指标有这些：保暖性、贴身舒适性、透气性、及部分附加特性（如抗菌保健等）。我们就逐项对比看看蚕丝被是个什么水准。
常见的被子填充有 5 种：化纤、棉花、羊毛、蚕丝、羽绒。市面顶着五花八门名字的被子，七孔、九孔、羽丝绒、大豆纤维被等，实质上都是各类化学纤维被。
保温性
作为自然界罕见的没毛生物，人睡觉盖被子核心目的就是保暖。

从纤维本身的热传导系数看，系数越高意味着越容易导热，保暖性越差。常见物质里，空气保温性最好（所以中空玻璃有很好的隔热性），水的保温性最差。
蚕丝与羊毛相当，优于棉纤维…</span>

                    <span>《镜》系列是沧月老师的经典小说，也是不少人的童年回忆。这部作品不仅有宏大的背景结构，更有个性鲜明的角色和他们之间错综复杂的关系。因此我认为，如何用视听语言来复现书粉们梦中的云荒世界是本次动画化的重点，重中之重放在了角色的塑造上（下面会详细说明）。
不同于其它的作品，云荒在地理设置上有相当的包容感，这就给了作品的美术很大的想象空间。充满神性的白塔和人来人往的桃源郡是完全不同的风格，因此在建筑和场景风格上本作可以做出相当华丽却又充满异域风情的视效，相信会给观众耳目一新的感觉。



我想重点讲讲角色。
在人物塑造方面，沧月老师的笔触是相当细腻的，这体现在每个角色都有自己丰满的个人故事和鲜明的性格特征，同时在小说中又并没有占据极大的篇幅就完成了群像式的角色塑造，这给我们动画制作带来了相当的挑战。为了塑造好人物，我们主要做了三方面的工作。
其一是剧情的取舍，如何在固定的篇幅下取舍故事是一个很大的难点。因为小说的内容十分丰厚，在有限的时长里，如何保证核心剧情的串联，又同时尽量保持每个角色的高光时刻，花费了我们相当的功夫。
第二个难点在于小说的叙事顺序是穿插的，天马行空的笔触结合宏大的故事让行文非常浪漫。但如果原原本本的按小说顺序照搬到周更的动画上，就容易抬高观看的门槛。我个人一直都认为动画最大的作用是做IP放大，让更多人了解和喜欢一个新故事；因此怎么做时间线和故事线的合并、让没看过《镜》系列的新观众也能轻松入坑是另一个攻略的重点。
第三，为了辅助二，如何保持角色立体的性格特征又对各自所处的阵营有归属感是美术方面发力的重点。我们制作时一边参考了小说中对于角色的描绘，一边给予了每个阵营鲜明的核心美术特征。比如鲛人族的角色因为国家破灭，长期被奴役压迫，几个主要出场角色又身负重任，因此在色彩选取上偏深偏暗，不会整体给成太小清新的感觉；就算是统领复国军的如意夫人，她符合表面职业的参考花魁的装扮，也是在她深色的裙摆基础上来作为点缀的。

                    <span>很幸运能够参加《镜·双城》动画的制作，《镜·双城》原作构建了一个奇幻世界，富有古风的韵味，又具有科技的元素，在这样广阔的背景下，活跃着许多精彩的人物，纯真善良的那笙，背负使命的苏摩，坚强温柔的白璎，机智幽默的真岚……每一个角色都具有自己独一无二的魅力，我在阅读原作时就非常喜爱这些角色，为故事的走向和人物的命运扼腕，被书中的情感深深地打动。



同时我们在制作时也在思考这个问题——故事线索细腻繁杂，由于不同媒介的表达方式不同，在改编之时很难涵盖小说中的全部内容，如果力求面面俱到，又会让整个作品冗长而缺乏主次，因此取舍变成了一个需要谨慎考虑的问题。不改变原作的本质进行删改，将故事的核心和人物的神韵传达出来，讲好主角们的故事，这是我们在制作中的一个重要目标，为了这个目标，我们反复阅读原作，梳理故事情节，在制作中推敲每一个细节是否符合原作精神。

我们希望，当这些角色和故事以另一种形式展现在他们面前时，这部作品能够回应老读者们的期待。
也希望新观众能在与片中人物一同探索云荒大陆之时享受到同等的乐趣。最后还希望大家能多多支持镜双城这部动画，同时也希望大家通过镜的动画找到自己内心的那份热情。

                    <span>作为《镜》的书粉，能参与《镜》的制作很兴奋，在整个制作中，我们在开发时阶段对原著做了大量调研和规划，努力还原大家眼中的云荒，这个奇幻大陆。
在设计初始我们考虑到镜是不同于修仙武侠风格的奇幻作品，云荒庞大的世界观本身作为镜系列的一大亮点，在本次的开发中，我们也在美术开发中针对这个亮点进行了系统开发。例如双城这部动画中出现的比较有代表性的空桑族，首先古代空桑作为比较尊贵的种族在服饰的设计上我们采用了比较端庄的广袖交襟制式，也加入了现代剪裁的风格，在服饰材料上采用了大量锦缎。因为锦缎的特点是密实厚重。而在征服海国后的空桑则以束口易于行动，以及绫罗和鲛绡等轻便织物为主。其中白璎的婚服和常服就是比较典型的代表。

中州族在设计，比较有代表性的是我们的主角那笙，整体服饰风格我们借鉴了苗族的银饰、苗绣、蜡染等苗族服饰元素。同时考虑到了中州的人文，当地盛产羽毛动物多以羽毛作为装饰品生产，所以在那笙的头饰设计上我们增加了羽毛饰品。

另外大家比较关心的苏摩所在的鲛人族我们也做了细致的设计，蓝发碧眼是鲛人统一特征，考虑到原著设定鲛人族在创世之初选择了美貌和歌声，所以全员设计上我们都此为重心进行设计。由于鲛人命运的多元性，我们根据每个出现的角色都进行了定制设计，例如苏摩从少年到成年，从送给白璎到离开空桑，再到桃源郡如意赌坊和如意夫人汇合，我们为苏摩设计了三套不一样的服饰，都是根据苏摩当时的境遇而设计。另一个比较有代表性的鲛人角色，炎汐，作为鲛人复国军的左权使，在执行任务的时候需要灵活和轻便的特征，所以我们采用了软皮革材质的盔甲设计，在纹理和结构上采用了鳞片和鱼鳍纹理等鲛人特有的元素。在裁剪上也采用了更加修身的裁剪方式来突出鲛人俊美的特质。 

最后希望大家在《镜·双城》这部动画中感受到不一样的美术设计，同时请大家多多支持镜双城，我们会继续努力的。

                    <span>沧月老师的《镜》系列自问世以来一直是深受广大读者喜爱的一套作品，书中充满了瑰丽的想象，为我们呈现了云荒这个奇妙的世界，富有魅力的人物以及丰富的故事。《镜·双城》作为这一系列的第一部，我们非常幸运能得到这个机会将其改编成动画，将书中的内容以一种不同载体呈现，我们也非常期待以动画的方式向更多的观众展示镜系列的故事。
《镜·双城》这一季我们尊重原著，做了群像戏的改编。同时我们也安排了一些有趣的剧情，例如真岚断手和那笙在去往云荒的路上。我们安排了很多小互动。


在动画制作方面，由于《镜》的本身题材属于玄幻，文戏也比较多，制作挑战比较大。大量的文戏需要更细致的角色演出来丰富效果，如何将每个角色的性格在一些小动作和表情上来凸显是一个很大的难题，比如我们在制作三维模型后，针对那笙比较活泼的性格，做了多次的绑定测试以及各种表情模拟。

本季制作除了动画方面我们也十分重视剧情，叙事流畅 ，剧情环环相扣是我们发力的主要方向。同时也希望能将镜中庞大的世界观通过故事、画面传达给观众。当然在改编的同时我们也尽可能的贴近原著，尽量还原大家比较关心的世界观设定和人物设定以及故事线。就像大家期待的一样，希望《双城》是开始，我们也希望有机会制作《镜》的整个系列，将完整的云荒大陆呈现在大家眼前。 希望大家能多支持多期待多关注我们哦。
感谢大家对《镜·双城》动画的支持，希望大家能在镜中找到自己的抉择、勇气、责任与爱。

                    <span>我是幻维数码斗破苍穹动画项目的导演赵丙乐，今天我和大家简单聊聊斗破动画的那些事。
       《斗破苍穹》可以说是我接触网文小说的开端，萧炎从低谷逆袭成长到炎帝的经历和面对世界的勇气让人过目难忘，当初看的时候爽到让我几个月连肝两遍。所以斗破也是我一路接触的网文小说之中心中地位最高的一部。

       原本斗一动画化的时候我就有加入项目的机会，但可惜由于当时制片进度无法匹配导致失之交臂。但一切似乎冥冥之中的注定，时隔几个月后，幻维数码的斗二又再一次给我了这样的机会，所以终于能够结缘斗破系列动画，这样的机会也让我非常珍惜。


       关于斗破的故事，我认为他的一大魅力在于能够吸引不同年龄层次的读者，因为随着人生阅历的不同，无论少年，青年甚至中年受众都会有自己独到的感受，因此关于动画剧集的创作，我们也是尽可能的去唤起大家对于小说原作的那种激情，所以我们使用了常规番加特别番的产品模式，在确保正常剧情更新推进的同时，对于重点剧情我们会更多关注角色的情绪和成长，以及各种名场面的塑造，让斗气大陆的世界观更真实立体。

       而三年之约作为整部小说的重大高潮情节，是我本身读小说时最热血沸腾的一个段落，因此抱着回馈广大粉丝的初衷，我们决心把他打造成史上最长特别篇，也为自己设立了一个全新挑战。所以我们不敢懈怠，有压力，也有担心会遗漏细节毁掉这样一个万众瞩目的焦点。本次斗破三年之约的成片，整季超过4820个镜头，其中超过80%以上的打斗和特效镜头也确实拉满了制作难度，可以说这样的创作难度和执行规格完全不输一部常规的动画电影，因此在大家爷青回的同时，我们整个创作团队在背后也付出了无数的汗水。


       集数设置的时候我们拟定了很多方案。比如打点萧炎与纳兰嫣然的比试结束做两集特别篇、一上二上云岚宗结束等。但最终我们还是选择了萧炎躲避云岚宗的追捕，离开加玛帝国的段落。因为…</span>

                    <span>一、LPL和LCK的恩怨情仇
英雄联盟总决赛（简称S赛，“S”即Season，意为赛季。S+数字，也常被用来指代赛季那一年）是由全世界地区联赛派出代表自己赛区最强实力的几支俱乐部队伍，众多豪门新贵争夺一个冠军的超级大赛，一年一届，目前是英雄联盟这款最高荣誉，也是具有最大知名度和影响力的电竞赛事之一。简单来说，这个赛事对于LOL这款游戏来说，就相当于世界杯对足球的意义。
今年是第十一届S赛。第一届是2011年举办的。
除去混沌初开，菜鸡互啄的前两届S赛， LCK（League Of Legends Champions Korea，英雄联盟韩国冠军联赛）及其前身因为韩国那边对电竞的重视，连拿了S3,4,5,6,7的冠军，当了5年的第一赛区。
LOL（League Of Legends )这款09年末推出的美国游戏，是腾讯（完整收购LOL开发商拳头的全资母公司）最主打的游戏之一，也是世界上最热门的网络游戏之一。中国大陆拥有基数最大的LOL玩家，也对LOL赛事拥有最高的热情，而代表中国大陆电竞的LPL赛区，却被LCK整整压制了5年，七年无冠。
这五年，每一年LPL队伍铩羽而归，队员大多都垂头丧气，无颜面对江东父老，有不少选手因为顶不住压力，打完S赛就引退了。
“抗韩”也成了老一辈LOL电竞人和中国大陆玩家的心病。
S1因为国服刚公测，所以跟国内没太大关系。但是老牌豪门WE和IG已经关注这款新游戏，成立了分部。S1初代冠军由欧洲的FNC获得。
S2，WE和IG参加了S2，但没有取得好成绩，中国台湾地区队伍TPA夺冠。但是WE在后面的IPL5为LPL赛区带来了第一个世界冠军，也给这款游戏带来了更大的关注度。同时，这一年韩国赛区的崛起已经显而易见。
S3,S4时期，确实LPL赛区的游戏理解不够到位和选手硬实力不足。S3 SKT的强势崛起，让LPL观众知道LOL原来还能这样玩？S4三星双雄…</span>

                    <span>敷面膜有用，但不要过度沉溺于相信面膜的补水，相反，要警惕一些面膜所谓的即时“效果”
最近刚好冬天到了，气温骤降，天气也变得异常干燥，很多小可爱的脸开始不淡定了吧？都再疯狂的补水吧，双十一是不是囤了一堆一堆的面膜和其他补水产品，试图靠它们躺过干燥的冬天？
当你们随便拿着一瓶动辄几百甚至上千的补水产品在脸上拍拍打打的时候，你们有没有想过：你们的皮肤真的需要这样吗？这样的“补水”到底补进去了多少水？补进去的水真的有用吗？还有，怎么补水才算科学？
皮肤真的需要补水吗？
说句大家都不愿相信面对的事实：其实我们的皮肤角质层乃至真皮层的水份大多都是通过体内的细胞和组织输送的，并不是通过外用涂抹化妆品获得的。尤其是我们的真皮层，它里面水量丰富、充沛，原则上说：真皮层其实完全不缺水的。所以不要相信什么深层补水，给真皮层补水的割韭菜的鬼话，通通都是骗人的。
来大家来看张图，这就是我们皮肤的含水量分布图。

真皮层不缺水，但是皮肤最外层的角质层就不一样了。角质层里面的水虽然也都大多来源于体内供给，但是由于毛孔和细胞间隙的存在，当受到外界因素（比如温度、湿度或者外力挤压）等影响时，角质层的水份是会被蒸发到环境中去的，所以角质层偶尔会缺水。那么它缺水的皮肤表征就是：皮肤干燥，蜕皮，紧绷甚至皮肤敏感。
虽然我们可以通过涂抹化妆水、敷面膜等各种方式给皮肤补水，但很可惜，与皮肤自身失去的水份相比，外用补给的水也只是杯水车薪。
所以大家会发现：我们要做的有效护肤，并不是给皮肤“补水”，而是要做好皮肤“锁水”。
“补水”和“锁水”，谁更重要？
“补水”和“锁水”很多人分不清，但其实他们两有本质的却别。
“补水”：是通过外用涂抹化妆品（尤其是敷面膜）来给角质层补水，浸润角质层，保湿角质层湿润的状态，维持其对应的一系列生理功能，比如皮肤修复以及担任屏障功能防御外界刺激。
“锁水”：则重在锁住肌肤的水份，不让它蒸发…</span>

前言
了解过设计模式的同学都知道，设计模式家族成员非常庞大，具体可以分为3类共23种设计模式
本文主要包括以下内容
六大设计原则的介绍
简单工厂、工厂方法与抽象工厂模式的区别
代理，装饰与适配器模式的区别
策略、状态与命令模式的区别
设计原则介绍
众所周知，5大设计原则一般有6个
单一职责原则(Single Responsibility Principle, SRP)
开闭原则(Open Close Principle, OCP)
里氏替换原则(Liskov Substitution Principle, LSP)
依赖倒置原则(Dependence Inversion Principle, DIP)
接口隔离原则(Interface Segregation Principle, ISP)
迪米特法则(Law of Demeter, LoD),又称最少知识原则(Principle of Least Knowledge)
其中，前5个原则称为SOLID原则
单一职责原则
单一职责原则很简单也很好理解：类的职责应该单一，一个方法只做一件事,这里就不多说了
开闭原则
开闭原则是说程序对扩展开放，对修改关闭：当你的程序需要扩展时，不应该修改原来的代码，而是可以添加一个类来扩展。
getPrice 方法，也可以增加一个子类，重写getPrice方法，通过高层模块，在打折时使用子类。
开闭原则的思想其实是将不变的地方封装起来，将可变的部分暴露出去，这样它们就不会混淆，还可以复用不变的部分，增加扩展性
里氏替换原则
里氏替换原则用一句话描述就是：所有引用基类的地方，必须能够使用其子类直接替换，换句话说，所有引用基类的地方必须透明地使用其子类对象。
Java中，引用基类的地方，本来就可以用子类替换，为什么要提出个原…</span>

插件开启之后，在文档中选中文字会自动打开外部浏览器搜索。
目前只支持文档选中搜索，不支持笔记、标注、脑图等。
下面分别提供了搜索引擎为Google、百度或者欧路词典app的版本供下载。也可按需要将main.js里的baseUrl自行修改为其他网站（需要网址）或者App（需要app的URL Scheme），可参考现有“研究”功能的自定义url。
自定义方法请看这一楼
请注意及时关闭插件，否则选中一次就会打开一次浏览器，你会疯的。

Google搜索引擎
reresearch_Google_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
墙内可用Baidu搜索引擎
reresearch_Baidu_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
其实最有启发性的是这个：自动欧路词典app内搜索
reresearch_Eudic_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
自动在德语助手app内搜索
reresearch_Eudic_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
以上插件不可共用。使用前请打开“允许加载未认证插件”
动机
起因是看到了 Xiamumu的这个帖子 ，聊这个我就不困了。
点击文档内的超链接一直都会在“研究”窗口打开，需要再多按一次才能打开Safari，很不方便。
开放插件功能后其实我有在尝试做一个超链接直接用外部浏览器打开的小插件。但是由于以下原因搁置了：
1）没有开发文档，不知道MN内响应打开链接的是哪个通知；
2）即使有开发文档，即使我可以直接用外部浏览器打开链接，但是并不能禁用原本在MN内浏览器打开网页这个默认操作（我猜的，在初期给插件这么嚣张的权限肯定不合适）。
看到上文帖子里的需求正好跟我之前的尝试有重叠，所以就先做了。跟之前的InstantCopy一样，依然是代码上很简单的小插件。
为什么叫ReResearch
其实这个插件的功能跟MarginNote自带的“Research”功能非常相似，所以开玩笑叫ReResearch。
其实最合理的做法是未来开发组在MarginNote的“研究”功能多加一个允许默认外部打开的设置。
为什么不支持脑图、摘要、笔记？
很惭愧，因为主要把MN当成带翻译功能的pdf阅读器在用，很少用到脑图、笔记等功能，所以其实我分不清什么是笔记什么是摘要什么是标题什么是注释什么是卡片，更不用说开发了。
但是有了这个简单的版本做参考，支持其他模式也很容易，欢迎随意修改。
不足
开发文档其实还没开发，只能基于官方插件摸索，这个插件现在还很不灵活。
一方面特别暴力，选中任何文字都会直接打开浏览器搜索。其实很有必要加一些前提条件，比如最简单的颜色判断，但是现在颜色是哪个属性值都还未知。
另一方面，要修改搜索引擎/URL Scheme只能在代码里修改baseUrl变量。理想/成熟状况下插件应该有自己的偏好设置界面。目前还不知道是否会有插件偏好设置或者如何设置。软件的设置界面已经很丰富了，插件设置也塞进去将会很可怕。
开发问题
现在用的还是旧的openURL方法，该方法已被废弃，新方法为openURL:options:completionHandler:。主要问题是不知道如何使用JSB调用这个方法，只能等有时间再研究了。很可惜我对iOS开发的认知还停留在iOS7时代。</span>

                    <span>注：本文适用于对MN有一定经验、想对MN的产品逻辑有一种整体性理解的用户，因此本文不使用任何图例。
关于MN作为知识型软件的测评已经足够多了，每一个使用MN的人首先期待的，自然是如何用这个神品APP安排自己的学习，用它来整理自己的知识，让它成为第二大脑——这一时下对相似工具十分流行的期待。但是我发现，还没有什么人介绍MN逐渐从“知识型app”向“创造型app”的转变，并且在这条路上的探索越来越精深，而正是这一点，让MN变得非同凡响。
   MN是如何做的呢？它如何建构知识型体系，又如何建构创造型体系，以及如何把二者衔接起来的？——通过层层递进的使用方法和逻辑。

MN按照知识获取的流程，设计了多层次的阅读逻辑，并逐渐转变为具有输出能力的创造模式。
从脑图到文本。也就是说，在对文本重建逻辑后，文本的重要性让位于脑图重要性。由于脑图的直观和非线性，他更符合人脑的信息存储模式，因为人脑记忆信息不是线性，不是书本那样从第一页第一个字到最后一页最后一个字的，而是跳跃性、主次分明、统观的。书本文本形式仅仅是信息最便捷的载体，却不是信息最易读取的载体。由于脑图的这种特性，不论是复习，再次阅读或者是知识概览索引，都变得极为方便。当然，MN提供了比脑图更具逻辑性和条理性的“大纲”功能，可以加速信息查找。
在脑图的基本框架建立后，MN围绕此对脑图功能的可能性进行了探索。增加标题链接功能后，文本的关键信息提取则更上一层楼，特别是当学习新知识时，专有名词会成为理解的阻碍，或者在阅读外文文献，某些词汇需要注意或记忆，都可以用辞典功能进行摘取定义。当你学习的东西较少，这个功能是不起眼的，而如果你要获得新的知识（特别是在这个终身学习的时代），你需要定义的概念越多，它对你就越有用。这个辞典功能还可以链接到其他“学习”，这个时候，它就会带来出人意料的作用，这在后面的层次再说。
脑图本身是层级架构的，因此原则…</span>

今年 10 月，《迟早更新》与播客平台小宇宙联合开展了一次「迟早公开」计划：该节目第 175 期《故事新编》将在小宇宙平台上首发，并以 9.9 元的价格销售。《迟早更新》承诺，如果付费人数达到 1000 人，将在全网免费公开该期节目，否则将继续仅限付费听众收听。该期节目发出后，经过一天半的时间即得到 1000 人次的付费，成功「解锁」并公开发布。
本文即为主播任宁和枪枪在活动结束后，就购买趋势、收听和互动数据、活动执行情况所做的盘点总结，以及在此基础上对内容付费、社交传播等问题的延伸思考。少数派经授权转载。

在最开始写下「迟早公开」计划（那时候还没有这个名字）的想法时，随手给文档取的标题是《请你一起来做个实验》。现在看来，「实验」一词的用法显然是有失偏颇的。实验便意味着在着手实施之前便有明确想要进行检验的假设，然后围绕这些假设来设计实验步骤并依次验证。而回顾「迟早公开」计划，即便我们确实带着假设——「利他考量」也许对付费行为有一定影响——出发，但后续我们并没有（事实上也很难）借此展开一场严格意义上的「实验」，正如某些听众在问卷调查中犀利地指出，「可能是还没想清楚的探索」。
并非是要咬文嚼字，但「探索」与「没想清楚」似乎是自相矛盾的存在。正因为没想清楚，所以才需要腆着脸迈出探索的第一步。作为一次投石问路般的试探，这场计划无论是在机制设计、数据回收以及统计分析方面存在着诸多局限，而我们试图从数据以及文本中总结出的一些趋势和观察也都难算得上是什么黑白分明的「结论」，仅供各位参考。
我们期待这篇文章不仅仅是一次计划的总结，还能够开启更多探索。

今年早些时候 Substack 把 newsletter 带火了。找了找发现中文世界写的人虽然不多，但颇有壮大之势，于是我也试了试。五个月过去了，以「自我探索与成长」的主题写了 20 期，所收获的远超我的想象：认识了一些通过现实世界不可能遇见但志同道合的朋友，养成了阅读写作的习惯，在这个过程中塑造新的自我。
YouTuber Ali Abdaal 在 一个播客 里说，「YouTube 可以改变你的人生，但你需要在接下来的两年中每周发布一个视频。如果你这样做，我保证它会改变你的人生」。我相信写作也是一个道理。
五个月离两年还差很远，但作为一个在线写作新手，我在这几个月的摸索中有一些心得体会，希望分享出来帮助考虑开始但还没有行动的朋友。如果你已经在写了，我希望能借此和你交流学习。
文章比较长，主要分为三个部分。第一部分着重聊一聊写作，解释一下前面提到的「塑造新的自我」，同时回答「写什么」和「怎么写」的问题。第二部分是一些具体的经验、感想和建议，最后是感恩和推荐一些链接。

前言
继续 Hero 组件的介绍，本篇来介绍 Hero 组件的另一个属性 flightShuttleBuilder 。这个属性用于设置飞行过程中的组件。默认的话 Hero 组件在飞行过程中是使用源页面的 Hero 子组件。有了flightShuttleBuilder，我们就可以在行过程中可以更换组件。
flightShuttleBuilder 定义
flightShuttleBuilder 是一个返回飞行过程中的方法，定义如下：
typedef HeroFlightShuttleBuilder &#x3D; Widget Function(
  BuildContext flightContext,
  Animation animation,
  HeroFlightDirection flightDirection,
  BuildContext fromHeroContext,
  BuildContext toHeroContext,
);

其中 flightDirection 是一个枚举，用于区分是 push 还是 pop。animation 原以为会在动画过程中变化，但是 debug 的时候发现只有一个起始值。三个 context 是在需要的时候可以使用，一般用不到。我们可以通过flightDirection 来定义 push 过程和 pop 过程中的组件。
示例
示例起始比较简单，我们这里使用了两个简单的色块作为飞行中的组件。
flightShuttleBuilder: (_, animation, direction, __, ___) {

                    <span>相信很多朋友都是ipad+win平台的组合（得益于苹果优美的价格），而ipad相对较小的屏幕总是不能很好地释放生产力，人眼通过二十多寸的屏幕获得的信息以及整理信息的能力自然比ipad顶到死13寸的屏幕好得多。ipad的便携性不言而喻，但当我们面对接着win电脑的显示器时，又该如何使用MN3呢？

虚拟机使用最大的好处我觉得就是效率高了很多，最大的优点就是和win上面的软件协同，而不用切换系统，就比如我在win上ocr了一本书，我可以直接把文件从win的桌面拖到macos的桌面，再放到mn3里，这样自由度会很高，对于我这样离不开MN3又离不开win（游戏玩家 ）无疑是一种福音。当然，对苹果生态有着极度依赖的还是推荐MacBook，虚拟机很多东西用不了的（例如隔空投送），如果只是用一些例如MN3的软件的话，还是热烈安利啦！

                    <span>大家是否还记得，在那个 iPhone 操作依赖 Home 键的时代，有些朋友为了延长 Home 按键的寿命，特意打开了辅助设置中的 AssistiveTouch 。随着 iPhone 交互与设计的不断进化，带 Home 键的 iPhone 已经逐渐被全面屏 iPhone 所取代。
时至今日，已经很少再见到有人启用 AssistiveTouch 了。除了 AssistiveTouch 之外，辅助功能里还隐藏着这些有趣的小功能，值得大家一试。
降低白点值：让你的屏幕更暗

功能路径：「设置」&gt;「辅助功能」&gt;「显示与文字大小」&gt;「降低白点值」

自 iOS 13 起，苹果为 iOS 系统带来了「深色模式」。开启深色模式之后，系统会将背景色调整为黑色。在夜晚注视屏幕时，一定程度上缓解了视觉上的刺激感，使眼睛更加舒适。
但是我一直都不喜欢这样的深色背景，从来不用深色模式。部分 App 启用夜间模式后，UI 配色经过了重新设计，与正常模式存在些许差异，让我一下变得无法适应。可你哪怕将 iPhone 亮度调至最低，夜晚用起来还是觉得刺眼。
其实还有一个办法，就是在辅助设置里开启「降低白点值」，你可以拉动滑块，在 25%-100% 之间选取你需要的数值。拉低控制中心内的屏幕亮度的同时，打开「降低白点值」，可以使屏幕亮度进一步变暗。
降低白点值
耳机调节：轻松调校你的耳机

功能路径：「设置」&gt;「辅助功能」&gt;「音频/视觉」&gt;「耳机调节」

如果你平常使用的是 Apple 或者 Beats 耳机，通过简单的听感测试，你就可以对耳机平衡音、音域、明亮度进行修改，获得更适合自己的音频设置。该功能可放大微弱的声音，并根据你个人偏好调整某些声音频率，使得声音更加符合你的听感喜好。

经过一段时间的打磨，重构过的 HapiGo 2.0 （https://hapigo.com）终于跟大家见面啦。
作为一款国人开发的启动器，我们一开始就没有想做大而全。而只想把国外启动器缺失很久的中文支持补上，把我们中文用户服务好。所以，2.0 版最大的特色就是全面的（应用、文件、书签）拼音搜索支持，让中文用户畅享英文用户才有的即时搜索。下面列举部分 2.0 优势功能供大家参考。
颜值也是战斗力
我们深入领悟了 Apple 这一精神🐶，2.0 第一要务就是提升界面颜值。提升的主要方面：一、支持 macOS 半透明毛玻璃效果（仅黑、白模式支持）；二、支持多种颜色主题。三、支持原生的 Big Sur 及 Monterey 风格。希望以上努力给各位提供更舒心的使用体验。

拼音支持最好的文件搜索
文件搜索可谓是常被忽略，但实则非常有用的功能。我们花大量的时间做文件管理，最终目标还是为了最快找到文件。如果制定了规范的文件命名规则，创建了结构清晰的文件夹目录，但每次打开文件依然「点点点点点点点点」，那费时费工的文件管理工作可谓白费功夫。其效率远没有使用启动器快速搜索并打开。
目前市面的 macOS 启动器均以 Spotlight 为搜索引擎，这个引擎对中文分词还不是很彻底。这就导致了大部分启动器的拼音文件搜索总是奇奇怪怪。为了提供最流畅的拼音文件搜索，我们重新开发了搜索引擎。

基于我们的新引擎，你可以：

多关键词或（|）且（空格）逻辑搜索
输入 &gt; 仅搜索文件夹
彻底的拼音搜索
文件后缀搜索

Those features are Pixel 6 exclusive as far as we can tell, but there was some other quality of life improvements too.

本周话题：腾讯的员工退休福利
本周，有一条程序员的大新闻：腾讯正式推出了员工退休福利。

这好像是国内第一家，互联网大厂给退休金。
具体方案是，员工在腾讯就职期间达到法定年龄退休时，可享受三项福利：
（1）定制纪念品；
（2）长期服务感谢金，金额为6个月的固定工资；
（3）退休荣誉金，由员工在&quot;服务年限金&quot;和&quot;50%的未解禁股票期权&quot;两项之中，自由选择其一。
这就是说，你到退休年龄了，腾讯会一次性发一笔钱。所以严格说，这不是退休待遇，因为后面就没了，不是每年都有的年金，跟退休工资是不同的概念。
我觉得，这是一件好事，对于员工来说，多一笔收入。另一方面也显示，公司对员工退休问题是重视的，会给予一定的照顾。
但是，我国的法定退休年龄，男性目前是60岁，可能很快就会调整到65岁。很难想象，程序员可以在腾讯干到这个年龄。我很怀疑，腾讯现在第一线的程序员，有没有达到60岁的，会不会一个都没有。
正当大家以为，腾讯只是画了一个看得见、吃不到的大饼时，它又抛出了第二个更震撼的安排：员工入职满15年，就可选择提前解锁退休福利。

这就是说，退休福利不需要等到60岁，只要在腾讯干满15年，就可以享受。算一下就会知道，如果大学或研究生毕业，第一份工作就入职腾讯，干满15年也不到40岁，这时公司就允许你退休了。
这意味着两件事。
首先，表示腾讯也认可，员工到了40岁左右，如果再待在第一线，…</span>

把自己想象成英雄了吗？

@Voyager_1：上上次觉得 CG 动画惊艳是 2005 年的《最终幻想Ⅶ：圣子降临》，我在玩过游戏几年后才看到这部作品，知晓制作年份时当即流露出「无比惊讶」+「难以置信」的表情；上一次被惊艳到是暴雪的《守望先锋》系列，在全片没一句台词的堡垒篇，我在机器和鸟儿的陪伴下观看了一部至今难以忘怀的短片；而这一次，陪伴我大学的游戏《英雄联盟》改编剧集《双城之战》也没有让我失望。

近日，Apple 的 iOS 15.2 Beta 增加了「数字遗产」处置的选项，用户可以在生前决定将自己的「数字遗产」展现给谁，他可以在用户身故后继承账户及相关数据。
这个功能重新将我所经历的一段往事提出来，我不禁问自己——如果我去世了，我的「数字遗产」谁来处理，又由谁来继承。

在他因意外去世后的第 2 周，我的朋友圈收到了他的一条动态。
那是一张是他一年前健身时的照片，我当时在下面评论吐槽了；而在这一天，他给自己点了一个「赞」。

那也是他走后我第一次哭。强忍了那么多天，这一瞬间突然觉得「他并没有走」，我哭的停不下来。随后我们共同的朋友打电话给我；想必他们也收到了同样的提醒，都在试图在弄清楚这是怎么回事。
许久后我冷静下来，这应该是他母亲在翻看他过往的朋友圈状态，用点赞表达追忆。但接下来几天，事情变得愈发失控：我不断收到朋友圈类似的提醒，他母亲甚至还回复了他的某条状态。
我理解一位母亲在失去儿子后的痛苦，以及迫切想追忆他的过往。但这个「点赞」的举动，不论是对我、还是对他的朋友，都是一种巨大的打击。不得已之下，后来我通过他亲戚，委婉地转达他母亲：这样做可能会给大家带来更多的伤害。终于，他的朋友圈回归了平静。
但这并不是他的微信在身后第一次被人登录。过世后没几个小时，他的微信朋友圈就发布了一份讣告。一瞬间所有的朋友都被他的突然离世所震惊，众多关心他的人，通过电话、短信、微信联系我，试图弄清楚这事情到底是怎么回事。
原来，他的亲属取下了他的手机卡，通过短信验证码得以登陆微信，发出了讣告。之后很长一段时间，这个微信账号全在他某位亲属掌控下。接下来的日子里，他的朋友圈陆续发布了追思文、…</span>

2018 年 5 月 30 日的宝可梦新作发布会上，任天堂的「第二方」工作室 干儿子 Game Freak 展示了旗下热门 IP「宝可梦」的最新游戏作品：《精灵宝可梦 Let&#x60;s Go! 皮卡丘·伊布》。本作以 1998 年 9 月 12 日在 Game Boy 平台发售的《精灵宝可梦 皮卡丘》——即国内老玩家所熟知的《口袋妖怪 黄》——为蓝本，利用 NS 的机能和特性对画面和玩法进行了全面重制，作为宝可梦 IP 在 NS 上的试水之作显得诚意十足。虽然《精灵宝可梦 Let&#x60;s Go》系列并非宝可梦 IP 的正统续作，但得益于原作的优秀质量，新作在剧情走向和养成系统等核心要素上的完成度相当之高，一经发售立刻受到了玩家和媒体的一致好评，甚至带动 NS 的销量持续走高，为即将结束的宝可梦第七世代画上了圆满的句号。
这可能是玩家初见游戏时发现的第一个彩蛋。
《精灵宝可梦 Let&#x60;s Go! 皮卡丘·伊布》是《精灵宝可梦 皮卡丘》的重制版，而《精灵宝可梦 皮卡丘》又是初代作品《精灵宝可梦 红·绿》的特别版，这么一款跨时空套娃式的作品中自然也少不了设置各种 Game Freak 用来「我致敬我自己」的彩蛋。在游戏刚刚开始的时候，玩家就会在自己的房间里发现一张耿鬼对战尼多利诺的海报，这张海报的内容其实就是《精灵宝可梦 红·绿》的开场一幕，由此可见其地位之崇高。令人意想不到的是，这部开启了宝可梦近三十年辉煌历程的初代作品竟也是任天堂炒过的冷饭，而且这碗饭一炒就炒到了现在。

龙公子找我买剑，五百两黄金要了玄铁定制版，都知道他是要跟张三比武，所以我要了一千。
龙公子富家子弟、成名多年，张三籍籍无名，两个人本无任何交集，但据说因为龙公子调戏女侠被张三辱骂，下不来台，于是有三个月之后的生死决斗。
江湖都知道龙公子拿了我的剑，都说张三败了。
玄铁剑的锋利天下无双，连我也觉得张三败了。
2
店门口来了个买剑人，但是他没有钱。
听说他三个月后与人有生死决斗。
至于他是不是张三，我不感兴趣。
他一定要我卖给他一把剑，于是我让他给我打工三个月。
这三个月里，我一直让他去给龙公子铸剑。
当然他不知道。
这个钱赚的很舒服。
3
剑好了，但那小子今天出门用左脚，所以我告诉他三个月没工钱。只把那把他都磨秃了的锤子给了他。
龙公子拿到剑很开心，又给了我很多钱。
这把剑削铁如泥，举世无双，他必胜无疑。
但他却败了。
据说他败给了一把锤子。
那个锤子跟剑击打的每一下，都打在了软肋上。
好像是天生的克星。

石头城破了，石将军死了。
石将军人如其名，跟茅坑里的石头一样，又臭又硬，刚正不阿，早就成了奸相的眼中钉。
他被弄到石头城的时候，奸相故意拖了军饷，他无奈，甚至把家传的宝剑送到我这里，换了一百把良剑。
我对宝剑的来历很好奇，他对我讲，当年他家遭灭门之灾，父母挡在他的身前，扔了宝剑给他，只来得及对他说了一句话。
“孩子，活下去。”
而那个屠杀他家的人，就是现在的宰相。
所以奸相一直想要他死，
于是他死了。
5
一个身穿破烂军衣的小兵出现在了我的门口。
他是来跟我讨石将军的剑的。
他说城破那晚，也是朝廷的御史来的那晚，有人打开了城门，放进了外面埋伏的异族。
而这个御史是宰相派来的。
我没有给他剑，因为他没有钱。
我只是给他一块饼，问他将军是怎么死的。
那个小兵说石将军最后挡在他的面前，张开双臂，身重数箭。
到死也没有倒下。
6
小兵躲在死尸里活下来了，
他要为所有人报仇。…</span>

本文将通过一个需求场景，介绍一个非常实用的 Flutter 列表滑动知识点，该问题来源于网友的咨询。
如何在 Flutter 上实现一个聊天列表，相信大家都不会觉得有什么困难，不就是一个 ListView ，然后根据类型显示渲染数据吗？这有什么困难的？

理论上确实没什么问题，但是有一个需求场景，却会出现一个无法修复的问题，那就是：聊天列表需要双向插入数据。
双向插入数据会导致 ListView 什么问题？ 举个例子，首先我们使用常见的 ListView 绘制出一个模拟聊天列表，这里使用了 reverse 反转列表满足 UI 需求，让列表从底部开始网上布局滑动：
ListView.builder(
        controller: scroller,
        reverse: true,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          var item &#x3D; data[index];
          if (item.type &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Right&quot;)
            return renderRightItem(item);
          else
            return renderLeftItem(item);
        },
        itemCount: data.length,
      )

运行后效果如下图所示：

首先添加红色的，模拟加载旧数据 list.add ，可以看到上面的数据出现了，没有问题；
接着我们滑动一段距离，没有问题；
接着添加绿色数据，模拟新收到新消息 list.insert，可以看到列表出现了跳动，没有停留在我们之前滑动的位置；
我们继续滑动，模拟新收到新消息，列表继续出现跳动；

                    <span>因為官方deepl插件太多不方便的地方，因此研究了兩三天搞出了個魔改版本。
目前google版本只有iphone使用時才是最新版本翻譯，ipad版本因為marginnote本身的webview的user agent 設定依然停留在ios13.3 （“Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 13_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148”，iphone 版本的為 “Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 15_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148”） 因此翻譯結果會非常殘破（舊版google翻譯）。希望能用上新版google翻譯的大家就請跟我一起向官方反應這個狀況吧，這個插件是解決不了的。
p.s. 演示用的錄屏不知為何上傳不了，不過我想展開來時兩個按鈕，縮起來時一個按鈕，大家應該不太可能不會用，所以應該沒關係吧？

@南鱼祭酒：阿米洛花旦娘 miya68 静电容键盘 

购买渠道：京东阿米洛旗舰店
入手价格：全价 890 - 店铺优惠 40 &#x3D; 850
下单及签收日期：9 月 18-19 日

这把键盘我主要看中两点：Miya68 配列和阿米洛静电容轴。

Miya68 是我前一阵很关注的一个配列，貌似是阿米洛与 Ducky 合作推出的，键圈的朋友们也常常形象地称之为「田字 68」。它名为 68，会让人误以为是传统 68 键的变种，但我认为它更应该是一个标准 87 键盘然后把 F 区砍掉、把编辑区最右边的两个键砍掉之后得出的一个配列，只需要把 pgup 和 pgdn 两个键改映射成 home 和 end，那么编辑区的键位配置就跟最常见的 87 配列一模一样了。经过长久的摸索，我认为这样的配列可以在满足我这样一个以文字输入为主的用户的基本需求的基础上让键盘面积最小。然而目前来说，田字 68 的键盘，除了一些客制化键盘（买起来很烦，要么蹭车要么海鲜市场），量产厂商里就只有阿米洛、RK 和黑爵有这个配列。黑爵那款不到 200 元，档次太差不考虑；RK 的右 shift 键莫名其妙，右边的三个修饰键也不是等比的 1.25u，再一次莫名其妙；只有阿米洛的 miya68 最端正。哦对还有一点，在我买这把键盘的时候，阿米洛只有 miya68 的接口是 Type-C 的（现已全线更新模具，全线 Type-C 了）。
「田字」 编辑区
至于阿米洛静电容轴，久仰大名。关于静电容，此前我用过国产的宁芝 plum，印象不能说很好…</span>

                    <span>引言
2015 年 6 月 30 日，Apple 正式推出「Apple Music」音乐流媒体服务。同年 9 月 30 日，Apple Music 在中国大陆地区上线。相比于美国地区个人订阅每月 9.99 美元的价格，中国大陆地区的个人订阅价格为每月 10 人民币，可以说几乎是全球最低。
但对于喜欢听音乐的人而言，国区 Apple Music 虽然价格低廉，但一直给人曲库不全的印象。因此，很多人会选择订阅非国区的服务。这种选择理由是否有事实支撑，随着时间推移是否又有新的变化？此外，Apple Music 在众多国家和地区提供服务，它们之间到底有什么异同，在此之间又如何选择呢？
为此，这篇文章选取了常见的几个外区——美国区、香港区、台湾区、新加坡区、日本区，与中国大陆区的 Apple Music 进行比较，比较维度涉及在曲库数量、功能差异、内容展示、多平台使用、多 Apple ID 使用、订阅付费等多个方面，同时也附带介绍了一些容易被忽略的相关功能，以期让你在选择 Apple Music 地区时能有一个明确的方向。

编注： 本文最初发表于 2020 年 3 月，获得广泛关注和支持，各渠道的阅读量累计超过 16 万次，在 Google 搜索引擎的「Apple Music 选区」等关键词结果页中居于首位。
本版系在原版基础上更新，主要根据近年来 Apple Music 自身和音乐流播行业的变化，进行了仔细的增删调整。主要包括：整体上新增了中国台湾地区的对比；新增了关于 Apple Music 电台、Apple Music TV、Apple Music on Apple News、支持杜比全景声的空间音频、无损音频、声控订阅等新功能的描述；更新了配图、表格；在定价和付款方式中考虑新增的 Apple One 方案等。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。
前言
以前去旅游时，总是想在短时间内尽可能多去点地方，把日程排得满满当当。
虽然回来的时候精疲力尽，但总觉得自己去了很多的地方，仿佛这趟旅游「不亏」「值得」。 但这样的旅游真的舒服吗？
新疆禾木
以我在新疆的行程为例，在北疆的半个月基本把主要的景点都玩完了，代价则是每天新疆时间入睡（1 点睡），广东时间起床（6 点起），每天超过 4 小时在车上，不停地奔波与景点与景点之间。回来之后，没有看到新疆的银河一直是我念念不忘的小遗憾。
在新疆看到在爬山的羊
而在第二年去内蒙古的时候，决心换一种方式旅游。因为想法出现突然（偶然发现机票很便宜），从有想法到出发的时间也很短暂，我们并没有做攻略，只是购买了机票，预订了呼和浩特中心区的酒店，收拾行囊就直接出发了。要去哪儿、要吃什么都还是在落地当天讨论的。
呼和浩特的街景
到达呼和浩特时，正是晚秋和初冬交际的时节，初雪还没来，日均 2 度的气候伴随着凉风倒挺怡人。有朋友笑话我们：现在大草原黄溜溜的还没有草，雪也没下，你们去内蒙古干啥。但是一旦想去的念头涌起，我们也顾不上那么多啦，只管出发就好。我们只在呼和浩特待了一周，没有去郊外的大草原，只是待在城市里吃吃喝喝，每天在街上闲逛，实打实地在这座城市漫游了一个礼拜。
南湖湿地公园
说了那么多，其实想表达「我曾短暂地驻足于呼和浩特，但没有长时间的与之相处」，作为一篇城市漫游指南，我更多的是游客的身份分享我来这座城市旅行的体验，分享我曾到过、觉得值得一写的事物。但因为不够熟悉，注定了本文并不是对这座城…</span>

极限竞速：地平线 5 / Forza Horizon 5

去墨西哥风情的赛道撒野。

推出日期：2021.11.05
登陆平台：Xbox（智能分发）、PC

微软第一方工作室 Playground Games 开发的开放世界竞速游戏，玩家将驰骋在基于实景打造的墨西哥城市与自然地貌，享受 1.5 倍于上代游戏的超大地图。
本作在画面方面取得了重大进步，引入了全新的动态气象系统，风暴、扬沙等天气不再只是一种游戏全局状态的切换，而是可以直接在场景中被观测到的气象团，按照开发团队的说法，这对于全图海拔跨度大的墨西哥风格地形来说尤其有意义。本作还有个「系列首次引入光线追踪」的噱头，在车辆鉴赏模式「ForzaVista」中，玩家将能欣赏到光线追踪技术加持下的各色爱车。
五代还着重充实了「竞速社交」的内涵：设计了名为「Horizon Arcade」的多人小游戏合集；增加了名为「EventLab」的一套工具，允许玩家构建自定义的赛事、挑战等；…</span>

It has a few headline features that separate it from the rest of the crowd, but it’s more or less just another mobile network. However,

                    <span>看到了Schwarz空间，tempered distribution，这些名词还是很亲切的。pseudodifferential不了解。粗略浏览过，我认为这个远比Atiyah的证明更像是真的。
我就随便说说我的想法，也许很“民科”。也不完全是我的想法，相关方向有一些文献资料，可以搜索“Beurling zeta function”。如果分析学家问数论学家：整数集在实数集中不过就是一个零测集，那整数为何重要？那么数论学家将如何回应呢？如何在分析学上证明整数的重要性呢？一个可能的答案就是，对于正弦波来说，实数是行波与坐标轴（在某些时刻）的交点，而整数（在相位为零且取波长的一半为单位长度的情况下）是驻波与坐标轴（在任意时刻）的交点，所以整数还是很重要的，它能决定一个波动的峰谷位置是否运动。这件事启发了我们，在研究一类特殊事物的时候，也许我们一开始可以考虑更宽泛的研究对象，接下来去缩小范围，逐渐找到特殊性产生的原因。
我们通常定义的整数可以写成
 
其中  是所谓的狄拉克函数。狄拉克函数在非零点处取0，在0处取无穷大，且狄拉克函数的积分是1. 在实函数的范围内，当然没有这种东西。事实上，狄拉克函数这样的函数，被称为广义函数，也称为分布distribution，可以用泛函分析里的方法给定义。  也是一个分布，通常称为狄拉克梳子Dirac comb.
这个时候，我们可以把黎曼zeta函数
 
写成
 
这种形式。
自然的问题就是，如果把  替换成其他函数或分布，这个积分什么情况下收敛？这种情况下，素数是什么？函数方程、解析延拓、黎曼猜想等一系列关于原版zeta函数的结论在什么样的  下仍然成立？这种广义的整数，以及相应的广义素数，是Beurling首先研究的。
第一个问题的答案就是所谓tempered distribution,也就是Schwartz空间上的连续线性泛函，直观上来说就是某种增长不太快的函数。
第二个问题的答案就是唯一分解定理的分布版本。
第三个问题，函数方程的两边一般会涉及不同的广义zeta函数，在一定条件下两边涉及的zeta函数相同，此时我们就可以得到一个解析延拓。
第四个问题就是黎曼猜想。由于已经由Deligne证明的Weil猜想与此有某些相似性，可以期待其证明过程能启发对黎曼猜想的研究。Alain Connes就长期用他建立的非交换几何做这件事。

先说为什么人气会超《圣斗士》，再说为什么现在很少被提及！


▼《魔神坛斗士》的人气
在战斗武装这个类别，《魔神坛斗士》的人气在当时来说，的确超过了《圣斗士》。但仅限在日本国内。



与《圣斗士》一样，《魔神坛斗士》也是美少年动画的一员。而与《圣斗士》的区别就在于一个有原著，一个没有。


没有原著这意味着什么？


这意味着不会受到原著的版权影响，在创作上的自由度就要高得多得多。


《魔神坛斗士》作为原创动画，在各个方面能够自由展开，满足了当时粉丝的各种需求。所有的创作都是在满足需求的前提下进行，这也就加速了它人气的暴涨。


与《圣斗士》最大的不同点还要说是对粉丝的各种福利


不只是关联玩具的贩卖，与插画师等的福利合影，各声优的CD发表，以及与搞创作的粉丝一起合作的联合杂志等。各种与粉丝的互动也都是促成了人气高涨的原因。



《魔神坛斗士》原本是面向小孩的作品，结果小孩没有太大反应，却受到了大部分年轻女性的追捧，很多腐女都是因为这部动画入坑。


看看现在的很多女性，追捧流量明星是个什么疯狂状态，就可以看作是当时的状态


面向人群虽然偏离了轨道，但是没有原著的束缚，所以可以随时按照当前需求进行创作，所以并没有翻车。


最明显的就是在人物外貌上。毕竟是要符合年轻女性的喜好，所以人物的外貌从最初带有点稚嫩风，变得越来越帅气，型男。















且主角五人的声优还结成了组合『NG5』，这一系列所带来的效益是很可观的。虽然面向小孩的玩具基本卖不出去，但也完全被其他方面给弥补上了。


所以《魔神坛斗士》的人气，就是因为没有原著束缚，随时迎合粉丝需求的高自由度创作的结果。


▼为什么现在很少被提及
没有原著对于此作来说也是一把双刃剑。它在日本的人气，更大程度上可以说是迎合市场需求的造物。


而《圣斗士》不同，作为战斗武装的鼻祖，最初的漫画原著就已经俘获了部分粉丝。而这部分人，就是纯碎的喜欢这个作品。


《圣斗士》的对标人群也没有偏离轨道，喜欢此作的也是男孩居多。粉丝的粘性程度，就绝对大于《魔神坛斗士》的看脸女性粉。



《魔神坛斗士》感觉就像是流量明星，人气爆得快，时代变了，也就无法持续下去了


而引进到国内的时候，我们也早就已经接受了一波圣斗士的漫画，动画的洗礼。而且圣斗士的手办，也都在国内盛行，其所带来的影响是巨大的。


不可否认，我们很大程度也在《圣斗士》的影子下去观看《魔神坛斗士》。因此，后者的影响力就不可能有这么大。


即使在日本有如此人气，但是在国内，没有人来为他打造人气


▼时尚因素
其实在时尚方面，我个人认为也是一个很大的因素。《圣斗士》的圣衣设计，华丽但并没有太失真。



而《魔神坛斗士》不一样，它凸显的是日本武士文化，在造型上就太特殊了。比起圣衣，外观更像机器人。



包括之后的《天空战记》也一样，装备较为夸张。且当时盛行四驱车，天空战记备被加入了四驱车元素，可以把装备当交通工具。






而三者一对比，就能很值观的看出，圣斗士有华丽，但最接地气。而且设计得也最漂亮，这应该也是导致其印象最深的因素之一。



圣斗士不只是人物本身是美少男，穿上圣衣后仍然能保持苗条的曲线，而另两部则就要逊色不是一点了。


不过总的来说，这铠甲三兄弟，对国内的影响都还是蛮大的，而且它们都有一个共同点：


三部作品的歌曲都很nice，至今也如此

                    <span>它是华夏文明的圣地，也是共和国工业建设的重镇，更是不容忘却的、永远永远的神都。

洛阳，一个深入中国人精神的名字。
它曾经是诗、是神话，是无数人心中最美的城市。「玉楼金阙慵归去，且插梅花醉洛阳」（出自宋代朱敦儒《鹧鸪天·西都作》）。
▼

它曾经代表着中国古代史上最惊艳的时光。
威风凛凛的天子驾六、香火袅袅的白马古寺，以及众生拜谒的龙门石窟，无不让人想见当年的熙来攘往。
▼

但它同时也是一座充满悲情的城市。
它是十三朝古都，无数次兵燹、无数次浮沉，令它逐渐沉寂于历史的烟海中，「若问古今兴废事，请君只看洛阳城」。直到新中国成立后，洛阳才重新找到自己的方向。
▼

洛阳！洛阳！对我们而言究竟意味着什么？
如今，当我们从数千年的尺度纵观洛阳的历史，就会发现，它是华夏文明的圣地，也是共和国工业建设的重镇，更是不容忘却的、永远永远的神都。

01 华夏之中
事实上，就地理禀赋而言，洛阳在中国众多古都之中可谓出类拔萃。
从宏观上看，它居于华夏版图的中心，北望太行、南连江淮、东临华北平原、西通关中盆地；
▼

而从微观上看，洛阳更可谓「河山拱戴」，包括崤[xiáo]山、熊耳山、外方山、伏牛山等在内的秦岭山脉，从西方逶迤而来，如同一只张开的巨掌嵌入洛阳西南，海拔高达2000余米。
▼请横屏观看

此外，嵩山立于东部，邙[máng]山卧于北部，如同一道道军事壁垒拱卫着中间的洛阳盆地。
▼

而从山的指缝中，密密麻麻的小溪汩汩而出，汇聚成伊河与洛河，
▼

两河在洛阳盆地冲积出肥沃的土地，然后交汇于邙山之南并注入黄河。
▼请横屏观看

就这样，洛阳居于华夏中心，且河山拱戴、水源充足、土地肥沃。
如此大好河山，只待谁人登临？

02 王都肇始
让我们将目光投向距今5000年前的中国。
此时华夏大地，已经孕育出众多史前文明，它们散布各地，灿若「满天星斗」。
而居于洛阳盆地的先民，则利用居于华夏之…</span>

                    <span>剧本杀，重在剧本不在“杀”


“由兴业路开往复兴路的G100次列车就要发车了。”伴随着熟悉的列车广播由人民日报新媒体中心为致敬建党百年而打造的“复兴大道100号”创意体验馆在北京爆红，与常规的图片、视频展陈形式所不同的是“复兴大道100号”将百年记忆实体化，精心构筑10大场景，打造可感知、可触摸的沉浸式体验，让每个参观者与历史记忆进行互动。

所谓沉浸体验（Flow Experience），也叫沉浸理论（Flow Theory）、沉浸式体验。沉浸体验在积极心理学领域是指：当人们在进行活动时如果完全投入情境当中，注意力专注，并且过滤掉所有不相关的知觉，即进入沉浸状态。沉浸体验是一种正向的、积极的心理体验，它会给个体参与活动时获得很大的愉悦感，从而促使个体反复进行同样的活动而不会厌倦。而说到沉浸式体验就不得不的提到与其密切相关的一个行业——“剧本杀”。
“剧本杀”作为小众圈层的游戏，
圈内人为之沉沦，圈外人雾里看花。一群人坐在一起，聊一个与自己毫无关系的故事，到底有什么不同寻常，让玩家趋之若鹜，沉迷其中？
何为“剧本杀”
“剧本杀”起源于欧美国家一个非常流行的派对游戏LARP（Live Acting Role Playing Game），用剧本虚拟出一场谋杀故事，玩家通过扮演剧本中的角色，根据搜证案发现场的证据和与其他人的沟通交流去探索完整的故事真相，并结合自己的故事背景演绎和推理破解案件过程，找出真凶或隐匿身份。
2013年，一款名为《死穿白》(Death Wears White)的英文剧本传入国内，这可以算是传入我国的第一个谋杀之谜剧本，同时也标志着剧本杀行业的起步——但只限于比较小众的桌游界。
而“剧本杀”真正开始被大众熟知并广受追捧，还要说到一档至今热度都极高的综艺节目——《明星大侦探》。

                    <span>简单来说，历史原因，贫富差距，皮城工业垃圾倾泻等，详细如下。
我们曾经团结一心，现在却变成一盘散沙。

皮尔特沃夫和祖安在英雄联盟宇宙中历史时间并不长，比起恕瑞玛和弗雷尔卓德拥有着远古的历史，上古时代的祖安和皮尔特沃夫仅仅是恕古瑞玛北方的一处贸易站，丝毫不起眼，但也因祸得福，没有过多卷入虚空的危机当中。
随着时代的发展，瓦罗兰大陆的地理位置被逐渐开发，贸易交流也开始大量增加。此时，皮尔特沃夫和祖安海路的便利渐渐显现出来。
在地图中可以清晰，双城的地理位置有多好。执掌着东西海路航道。

双城掌握着东西海路航道，凭借地理优势赚得盆满钵满
皮尔特沃夫坐落在毗邻祖安城区的悬崖之上，俯视着大海，一批批船队穿过它巨大的海湾峡口，满载着来自世界各地的商品。海运贸易带来的财富曾经为城市的成长带来前所未有的推动作用
因此皮尔特沃夫和祖安因为地理位置的靠近和所在环境相似，成了英雄联盟宇宙中唯一的双生城邦，在这个阶段，他们团结一心共同发展，科技水平也是整个瓦罗兰大陆的前列。







可意外发生在，一次的地貌巨变，导致原来同为一体的二者，开始分裂开来。祖安坐落在皮尔特沃夫周边蜿蜒的沟壑与峡谷之下。在进化日中写道，地貌巨变还彻底淹没了祖安的一个城区。
进化日在他的家乡祖安有着另一番意味，他还顺便强调了祖安才是最初的进化之城，远在皮尔特沃夫出名以前就是。在上面，进化日纪念的是日之门的首次开启，它标志着瓦洛兰东西部之间的快捷贸易路线终于打通，同时也标志着贸易税收从涓涓细流变成了滚滚巨浪，注入了皮尔特沃夫城邦金库。而在下面，祖安会在这一天缅怀那些由于地貌巨变而殒命的人们：运河打通了东西两侧的大洋，同时也彻底淹没了祖安的一个城区。
更令祖安无奈的是，工业带来高生产力和经济 ，同时也带来了工业污染。
在皮尔特沃夫和祖安中，毫无节制的工业活动让城中的大小沟壑变成了剧毒的河流，空气变得浑浊。

这大概是关于“双十一”与“空军节”最生动的表述。
正如有人说的，一个国家若没有强大的空军，就像一座徒有四壁而没有屋顶的房子。




1260万平方公里的领空，是一个国家全部的空气空间，也是人民空军守护的疆域。

万米高空，波诡云谲。犯我领空者，请立即离开。


空军又不仅仅只是在飞机上，雪域高原上的雷达站，隐藏密林的地空导弹，指挥方舱内的通信兵，云端死神般的空降兵，甚至空天之上的航天英雄，都是一支大国空军的羽翼。



作为战略军种，人民空军的使命任务涵盖极广，除了国土防空等作战任务。
还包括空投试验核武器，新型飞机试飞，抢险救灾，人工降雨，国际交流合作等。




这是一个志逸云天的军种。
空军蓝，让这支充满科技感、青春感的部队，倍增迷人风采，成为国民心中的蓝天娇子。



双十一，不止是购物节或光棍节，更是人民空军成立72周年的日子，他们才是真正的主角。

临危组建


中国共产党人的空军梦可以追溯到1930年3月16日。国民党一架“柯塞”式侦察机在鄂北迫降被赤卫军俘获。徐向前亲自邀请飞行员龙文光加入工农红军，这架飞机也被改名“列宁”号，这是我们的第一架战机。

1946年3月1日，吉林通化东北民主联军航空学校创建，这是我军第一所航空学校，由于条件十分艰苦，飞机是用马车拉来的，飞行员的安全带是一根麻绳，大部分时候航油得用酒精替代，空中的飞机联络靠的是“抖动翅膀”。
3年多时间，老东北航校为我军培养了126名飞行员，五百多名各类技术人员。



人民空军的正式组建，最直接的动力来自一次灾难。

1949年5月4日，6架国民党军B-24轰炸机，向北平南苑机场投下30枚重磅炸弹，跑道上4架战机被毁，油库里五吨重的储油桶腾空爆炸，吞没了前来救援的消防车。

                    <span>有希望成为一个多赢的好事，希望大家不要看到征求意见就认为这是相关部门要开始打压剧本杀行业。我认为剧本杀行业确实需要一定的规范，这对于行业发展是有必要的。不过管理规定征求意见的几行字，看得确实让人喜忧参半。
一条一条慢慢说吧。
一.剧本杀——野蛮生长的结束与规范化的开端
自《死穿白》传进中国到 2017 年各个城市开始广泛出现剧本杀店，再到 2020 疫情缓解后剧本杀的井喷式增长。不知不觉剧本杀已经成为了当代年轻人新兴的娱乐方式。但是与电影、KTV 不同，始终没有一个成文的规章制度去规范剧本杀行业。这导致了众多问题：

前段时间闹的沸沸扬扬的「剧本杀《水镜八奇》的设定抄袭《火凤燎原》」，还闹到了湾湾那边，被人指着鼻子骂没法还嘴；
部分剧本杀充斥着 18 禁的内容，却被无良商家毫无底线的给未成年人玩；
大量不懂行的人看剧本杀蛋糕越做越大，无脑加入希望分一杯羹，不仅自己血本无归还影响了一大批新玩家对剧本杀的看法。
......

这些问题看似每个闹的都不大，但如果有人将它们整理到一起，就会发现这已经扭曲了剧本杀在「圈外人」眼中的形象，更严重影响了剧本杀行业的良性发展。前一段时间新华社所发文章《宣扬暴力、灵异变味的「剧本杀」引担忧？》，正是部分人甚至相关部门看法被部分蛀虫扭曲的结果。
如果真的有监管措施或者管理规范可以对这些乱象进行监管并予以纠正，我认为这对剧本杀行业的发展是百利而无一害的。

二.带上镣铐跳出更美丽的舞蹈
佩里曾经用「带着镣铐跳舞」来形容诗人创作诗歌。而事实上，各行各业的发展何尝又不是这样，只有作出了合理的限制，才能更好的促进行业发展。在这里我想提出几点，我认为剧本杀真正需要规范的地方：
经营用地的规范
在 17，18 年，我去过的大部分剧本杀店都是在写字楼高层或居民楼中，一个房间是一个主题，玩本的几个小时里就在某个主题的房间里一盘盘一下午，现在想想那时候还挺开心…</span>

                    <span>前言
每个应用在启动的时候都会初始化一个application类，我们可以在这个类中做一些初始化的操作，例如第三方sdk的初始化，在实施组件化工程后，不同的业务模块也需要在应用启动的时候做一些初始化的操作，这个就涉及到了模块的生命周期问题，在应用启动时候，各个模块可以拿到application，在Application内部的生命周期方法被调用的时候，各个模块也有相应的生命周期方法被调用
初步实现
1.抽取一个IModuleLifeCycle类
代码如下
public interface IModuleLifeCycle {

    int MAX_PRIORITY &#x3D; 12;
    int MIN_PRIORITY &#x3D; 1;
    int DEFAULT_PRIORITY &#x3D; 6;

    void onCreate(Application application);

    void onTerminate();

    /**
     * 返回组件的优先级，优先级范围为[1-12]，12为最高，1为最低，默认优先级是1
     * @return
     */
    int getPriority();

}

2.实现IModuleLifeCycle类
各个模块内新建一个类实现IModuleLifeCycle类，我们把这个当作模块的application类，在这个类可以做一些初始化的操作，还可以获取application对象，做一些初始化全局变量的工作
3.如何管理组件的生命周期
假如现在有moduleA, moduleB, moduleC,然后这三个模块分别对应有ModuleALifeCycle,ModuleBLifeCycle,ModuleCLifeCycle实现了IModuleLifeCycle类，用于实现模块的生命周期，为了实现这三个模块的…</span>

🔥 应用场景
Toast提示默认显示在界面底部，使用Toast.setGravity()将提示显示在中间，如下：
        Toast toast &#x3D; Toast.makeText(this, str, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
        toast.setGravity(Gravity.CENTER, 0, 0);
        toast.show();

运行在在Android 12上无法显示，查看Logcat提示如下：
Toast: setGravity() shouldn&#x27;t be called on text toasts, the values won&#x27;t be used

意思就是：你不能使用toast调用setGravity，调用无效。哎呀，看给牛气的，咱看看源码找找原因

                    <span>P 图功能与 OpenGL
玩过 P 图软件的朋友一定对这个功能有所了解，P 图我们可以简单地看做把一个区域的像素按照某一方向进行移动，产生一定形变效果，基于这个原理，我们可以手动实现瘦脸、长腿、瘦腰、大眼、丰胸等等一系列效果，从而达到美颜、美型的目的。

我们将一个区域的像素移走以后，那么用什么来填充这个被&quot;掏空&quot;的区域呢？答案是， OpenGL 自带插值功能会使用周围的像素对被&quot;掏空&quot;的区域进行插值填充。
回想下 OpenGL 纹理贴图，将图像贴到相对大的区域，就会产生拉伸的效果，贴到相对更小的区域就会产生挤压的效果，这都是借助于 OpenGL 的双线性插值算法实现。
对纹理贴图不了解的同学可以移步：Android OpenGL ES 系统性学习教程 
所以，当我们选中一块图像区域进行移动时，OpenGL 纹理贴图时会在移动的方向上产生挤压的效果，而反方向便会产生拉伸效果，从而可以实现对人体部位形变效果。
OpenGL 实现 P 图功能
根据上节讨论的原理，我们把选定位图像区域看成一个圆形，圆形之外的区域不进行偏移形变（不受影响），圆内的区域的像素则是越靠近圆心移动位移相对越大。

如上图所示，BC 表示偏移方向和偏移程度的向量，将圆内的所有像素按照向量 BC 的方向进行一定程度的偏移，像素偏移的强度，和像素与圆心的距离相关，越靠近圆心强度越大。

再回想下纹理贴图（纹理映射）那篇文章，我们只是将图像映射到一个网格（2个三角形组成），这是我们只能对整图做形变，无法做到对如脸部等一小块具体的区域做形变。

以此类比，这个时候我们就需要更多的网格，当网格足够密集，就可以覆盖整张图的全部区域，这个时候我们通过调整网格，可以实现对任意区域的形变，从而手动实现瘦脸、长腿、瘦腰、大眼、丰胸等等效果不在话下。
生成更多的网格实际上是为了能控制一小块网格区域图像的形变，也就是一定范围内…</span>

                    <span>看到这篇文章的时候，官方应该已经公布了本次测试的中签结果，幸运的玩家很快就可以正式进入游戏了。
在万代南梦宫台湾的协助下，篝火营地已于近日先行体验了本次 Beta 测试内容，对游戏初期场景「宁姆格服」西南部进行了探索。在正式进入游戏之前，已经按耐不住的玩家可以通过这篇文章来对试玩版内容预览一二，或许也能帮你在限时测试中节约一点时间。

Beta 测试概况
这次的试玩版已经开放了网络联机功能，但由于测试规模较小，我们没能成功「摇」到任何队友或者被他人入侵，唯一能体现出「已联机」的内容是遍布 Boss 门前的留言。
试玩版游戏的所需硬盘空间为 6.88 G。原以为不会有过多内容，但稍加试玩之后发现自己还是草率了：我花了大概 15 小时，还是觉得有很多可疑的场景没能来得及深入探索。排除掉摸索、试验和素材录制等工作需要，完整体验大约需要 10 小时。有攻略的话就更快了，这里单指自行摸索。
在关服前我在游戏中一共遭遇了 10 场带血条的 Boss 战，其中一个是开场的弹反教学 Boss。流程必经的战斗只有一场，其余都属于可跳过环节，绝大多数小 Boss 都位于地下城场景。10 个 Boss 中，有 8 场胜利后显示「FOE VANQUISHED（击败敌人）」，另外两个显示的则是「GREAT FOE VANQUISHED（击败强敌）」—— 一场是刚刚提到的必经剧情战，另一个是此前 20 分钟演示最初出现过的飞龙。

根据官网公告，本次测试持续 4 天，但服务器只在指定时间开放 3 小时，共计 15 小时可供试玩。如果想要在不看任何攻略的情况下彻底探索整个区域，玩满 15 小时差不多已经够完整跑一圈了。不过毕竟不是每个人都能精准预留时间，建议希望完整体验的玩家稍微做出一些规划，避免走弯路。

Beta 测试提供的可用「出身」共有五种，分别是剑士、魔法骑士、预言家、勇者和白狼战鬼，我们分别…</span>
