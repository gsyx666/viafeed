Research on how AI can integrate itself into mental health treatment is in its early stages of development. While AI is not ready to be deployed as a sole treatment, NLP has shown promising results in tandem with other methods of treatment.

While being on a steady rise for years, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased reported cases of poor mental health significantly. KFF reports that the implications of the pandemic have resulted in 4 in 10 adults reporting symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorders. The increase in cases has a risk to further stress the US’s overburdened mental health system. Advancements of AI in health care could show promising results for the tre…</span>

                    <span>In this blog post, we will learn how to build a TypeScript util type, that exposes all the key paths of an object, including the nested ones.
Have you ever built TypeScript function that receives a specific property of an object, by specifying the object and the path to that object&#x27;s property? Something like this:
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,
  dog:{
    name: &quot;Rex&quot;,
  }
}

function get(object: ObjectType, path: string){
  const keys &#x3D; path.split(&#x27;.&#x27;);
  let result &#x3D; object;
  for (const key of keys) {
    result &#x3D; result[key];
  }
  return result;
}

get(person, &quot;dog.name&quot;) // Rex

Well, obviously this works very well, but you aren&#x27;t taking full advantage of TypeScript! You can easily do a typo on the second argument (path) and lose some precious type with debug…</span>

                    <span>The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object&#x27;s prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.
let us look at an example

let person &#x3D; {};

person.name &#x3D; &quot;David&quot;;
person.age &#x3D; 45;

person.eat &#x3D; function() {
console.log(&#x60;person is eating&#x60;);
}

Here we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.

When you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.
So the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.
When a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:
Returns undefined (if you tried to access a property).
Throws an error (if you tried to call a method).</span>

                    <span>The bundler configuration for a Chrome Extension can be pretty complex. When I started making Chrome Extensions, they were small projects for clients who wanted to automate a task. I was starting a new Chrome Extension almost every week, and it took too much time to configure a new project. Then I thought, &quot;We already have a manifest; why do we need more config files?&quot;
That&#x27;s the idea behind rollup-plugin-chrome-extension, also known as RPCE. My name is Jack Steam, and I&#x27;ve been hard at work over the last few months adding Vite support to RPCE. So today, I&#x27;m excited to invite you to try out RPCE with Vite.

Branding yourself online has become increasingly important as landing a role in the tech industry is constantly getting more competitive. If you want to freelance, creating a personal brand is the absolute best way to land roles, but it’s still important for those of us looking to gain more traditional roles. Creating a strong online presence that is clearly branded will help employers and clients understand exactly what you can do for them. It will also create a strong sense of skill and authenticity, as well as display your communication skills. Plus, it’s a great way to network.
So what exactly goes into creating a personal brand? The good news is that you don’t need to be a marketing expert to accomplish this, you just need to spend a bi…</span>

We’re going to expand our application so that it provides the same RESTful HTTP API as a json-server.
We’re not going to deeply examine Fielding&#x27;s definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn&#x27;t RESTful. Instead, we’ll take a simplified view and concern ourselves with how RESTful APIs are understood in web applications.
One convention is to create the unique address for resources by combining the name of the resource type with the resource&#x27;s unique identifier.
Let&#x27;s assume that the root URL of our service is example.com/api.

                    <span>What is a Linked List?


Linked List is a fundamental and linear data structure which is known for it&#x27;s high performance on insertion &amp; deletion. It is commonly used as a building block in other data structures like Queues, Graphs and Trees. With that, we can also say Linked List is an important step to understand these data structures - as well as building custom ones.
There are different variations of Linked Lists: Singly Linked List (or we just say Linked List unless it is specified), Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List, and more. For more details on variations, take a look at the Wikipedia page: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
Among variations, Singly and Doubly Linked Lists are the most common ones. In this article we will be focusing on Singly Linked Lists.

                    <span>Improving performance is an art. To me, chasing performance issues feels like it flexes the same muscles as debugging. You&#x27;re wading into the unknown with only a sliver of information. But instead of understanding why it does that one weird thing, you&#x27;re asking adjacent questions: Where is it slow? Why is it slow? Then of course, How can it be improved?
This post will be the first in a series outlining how I approach improving performance, specifically for laggy UIs built with React. Even though this will mention tools and techniques specific to React, a fair amount of this would transfer to general-purpose optimization work. No matter the environment or tools, I&#x27;m trying to answer the same questions.
So, you have a UI that feels slow. Where do you start? This post will cover two big chunk…</span>

To render my files I use React Markdown. It&#x27;s an awesome component that can render markdown files without any config.
After a few posts, I figured out that I need some custom components rendered with my posts. One was for images, to make them zoomable for phones and the second one was a syntax highlighter for code snippets. 
React has a huge amount of components that can help us with both of these. I decided to use  react-zoom-pan-pinch for image zoom and react-syntax-highlighter for syntax highlight.

                    <span>相信很多朋友都是ipad+win平台的组合（得益于苹果优美的价格），而ipad相对较小的屏幕总是不能很好地释放生产力，人眼通过二十多寸的屏幕获得的信息以及整理信息的能力自然比ipad顶到死13寸的屏幕好得多。ipad的便携性不言而喻，但当我们面对接着win电脑的显示器时，又该如何使用MN3呢？

关于虚拟机网上教程很多，这里贴一个 装机教程|Win10下虚拟机VMware安装Mac OS系统 | 莲梦青语   比较贴心的装macos的教程。有几点这个帖子里没提，一个是装上后不能全屏的问题  电脑中VMware虚拟机安装Mac系统无法全屏显示怎么解决－系统城  还有就是网络的问题（这个不同电脑可能不太一样，大家自己百度或Google一下啊）。然后贴一下使用截图

虚拟机使用最大的好处我觉得就是效率高了很多，最大的优点就是和win上面的软件协同，而不用切换系统，就比如我在win上ocr了一本书，我可以直接把文件从win的桌面拖到macos的桌面，再放到mn3里，这样自由度会很高，对于我这样离不开MN3又离不开win（游戏玩家 ）无疑是一种福音。当然，对苹果生态有着极度依赖的还是推荐MacBook，虚拟机很多东西用不了的（例如隔空投送），如果只是用一些例如MN3的软件的话，还是热烈安利啦！

                    <span>每年的下半年是各种考试的密集区——对于学生党来讲是一年之中的大考，考个好分数，开心好过年；而对于职场人来讲，下半年，各类的专业技术能力考试与职业资格考试充斥，而且不少公司内部也有各种形式的让人开心的内部测验。
但凡是场考试，基本上都是绕不过去的。只有考和考，这样一个选项，所以备考的功课多多少少是要做的。
然而工作了之后，每天真正能够用于学习的时间却是非常少的。而当有了结婚生子之后，可利用的时间又会在非常少的基础之上，再度减少。做点属于自己的事情就要见缝插针。
针对这样的情况，结合我自身的经历，我对自己学生时代的备考方法进行一下调整，在备考过程中用起来还不错。我就把它整理了一下，于是就有了这篇分享。这当中的部分做法不仅可以用在备考之中，也可以用于其他笔记记录。
我的方法主要包括两部分，一是基于 A4 稿纸基础之上的笔记整理，另一个是基于错题整理基础之上的知识体系重构。
我整理的一本备考笔记，类似的我还有好几本
关于考试与测验
我们日常参加的各种考试一般分为两种：一种是测试过关能力测试，一种是选拔人头。感兴趣的可以去了解效标参照性标准体系与常模参照性指标体系。
为了便于理解，这里举个栗子。老师组织了一场考试，60 分及以上视为合格，分数最高的人可以获得一等奖。这里「60 分及以上视为合格」就是属于前者，完成通关任务就行；而「一等奖」这种大事一般来讲只会有一个人，无论难易。听到规则之后，每个人都会根据自身的情况进行评判并作出相应的决策，或是稍微躺平，或是努力奋斗。
讲这个的主要目的其实就是，我们的时间与精力是有限的，对于那些属于过关类的考试不要全部押宝上去，合理分配，以实现相对最优的投入产出比。
考试，不管是四六级考试、研究生考试，还是职业资格考试、专业技术资格考试（职称考试）都会有各种各样的辅导班。不少人也会去选择报名这样的辅导班。当然无论辅导班是否对自己的考试有助力，最终的考…</span>

                    <span>Windows 11 带来了全新的视觉、听觉体验和不少令人耳目一新的功能。不出所料的是，这些更新还搀杂了各种全新的 Bug 和特性。当然这似乎是一种潮流：几家科技巨头都热衷于在发布会和宣传片上炫耀新功能，却留下各类恼人的 Bug 或「特性」供开发人员修复到猴年马月。更何况 Windows 只占微软整体收入一小部分，市场中又没有任何产品足以与之竞争，指望微软官方短时间内有动力提供更好的系统体验太过不切实际。
不过使用 Windows 时的遇到诸多不顺自有应对之道。如果你苦恼于莫名宕机的开始菜单，存在感极强但作用不大的 Teams 和小组件，亦或者愤满于微软高筑的软件迁移门槛，那么下面的这些技巧或许能帮助到你。部分技巧同样适用于 Windows 10。
通过文件和链接类型更换默认浏览器
是的，更换默认浏览器竟然再次成为了需要拿出来说的东西。
如果你是从 Windows 10 升级到 Windows 11，那么你的浏览器设置将会被保留。而如果你的 Windows 11 为全新安装，现在想从 Edge 切换到其他的浏览器，在目前（22000.348）版本中，你会发现原来的「默认程序」界面不再提供切换默认浏览器功能。这显然是为了提高用户从 Edge 迁出的门槛。

现版本如果想要切换某浏览器为默认，需要更多的步骤。假设我们想要将 Liberwolf 设定为默认浏览器，需打开设置面板，进入 应用 &gt; 默认应用 &gt; Liberwolf，将 .html、.htm、HTTP 和 HTTPS 四个条目设置为 Liberwolf。

微软的这种举动倒逼部分厂商做出回应。从官网下载的 Firefox 用户目前可直接的浏览器设置中将 Firefox 设置为默认。Windows 应用商店中 Firefox 则无此功能。

                    <span>和 Android 系统一样，很多 Android 应用也会选择将源码进行开放，一方面供开源社区对代码进行审查保证安全性，另一方面也能「集思广益」，经其它开发者之手发展、演变出更多有意思的代码分支和功能。
更重要的是，因为源码人人可获取，当这些应用的商店版本（如 Play 商店）因为各种原因更新缓慢，或原始分支不再维护时，我们也可以直接绕过商店、借助源码编译「原汁原味」的最新版本。
本文就为大家介绍一种相对简单、能够自给自足的 Android 应用编译方法。
自己编译应用需要哪些工具？
要想编译 Android 项目，首先我们就先来看看项目源码的一般目录结构，了解我们需要一些什么样的编译工具。

编程语言：2021 年 Android 项目主要支持的编程语言是 Java 和 Kotlin。两者语言都是运行在 JVM 环境中，都需要各自的编译器 javac 和 kotlinc 把源码编译为 JVM 的字节码。
包管理器：Android 项目常见的包管理器是 Gradle，它负责管理和下载项目的第三方依赖，并且构建出可安装运行的 Android 安装包 (apk)。
开发套件：开发套件在图中是一个隐藏的依赖 —— Android SDK 。在大部分的平台架构上开发 GUI 程序，基本绕不开平台的 SDK。
至此，我们了解清楚了我们所需要的工具，那么下一个问题就是从哪里获取这些工具。
传统编译方法比较麻烦在哪里？
传统的办法编译 Android 项目是下载 Android Studio 集成开发环境，作为一个 IDE 它包含了上述所需要的全部的工具，但是它也有以下的弊端：

从 Android Studio 下载指定的 Android SDK 版本也还需要一定的步骤
Android Studio 自带的 Java 版本较新，不一定能编译通过旧代码
Gradle 下载依赖的时候由于…</span>

Android 12L Beta 1 发布

本周，Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本已经发布，但其实 Android 12L 对于大部分 Android 爱好者其实也都不算太陌生：毕竟如果你有仔细看周报的话，上一次提到 Android 12L，大家想到的可能都是关于 Google 折叠屏手机项目（又称 Pixel Fold）搁浅的新闻。

 
但作为 Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本，我们还是可以借此了解更多 Android 12L 中的新特性：毕竟除了面向大屏/高 DPI 显示所做的优化之外，Android 12L 本身也有「Android 12.1」这一另一层含义，因此也包括一些对于原生 Android 12 使用体验上的改进。

在 UI 细节上，Android 12L 为了应对大屏使用，类似壁纸设置 UI 等二级菜单都采用了浮窗而非先前的全屏设计，最近应用页面中的「清除所有应用」按钮也加上了 Android 12L 风格的圆角矩形边框，很多 UI 操作细节都变得更加顺滑自然；符合 Android 12 整体对于 UI 动效的调整风格。触觉反馈的调整也更加柔和，这些本身都是 Pixel 系列的强项，Android 12L 中只是进一步优化了体验细节。

另外，在 Android 12 正式版中没有的投…</span>

                    <span>这个原因其实非常简单：
如果你看过2017年，ssg夺冠之路，我相信你也会非常喜欢这支队伍。
如果各位刚好有时间，我就凭记忆回顾一下S7都发生了什么，然后你就明白为什么管泽元（包括我）喜欢ssg，喜欢crown了
本身2017年我也是全年在看LCK，一场不落，而管泽元也经常去解说lck的比赛。我们都见证并经历了SSG的传奇！（这个教练非常厉害 ，还有替补haru是狮子狗本命，据说只拿狮子狗上王者，后来我记得很多lck比赛他拿狮子狗必赢的，这就叫本命英雄）

三星是S7的3号种子，可以说是从悬崖下又爬上来的，一路过关斩将，拿到了最后一个名额，为了拿这个名额，不容易，都是劲敌，但时间久远，我忘了都是什么队了，反正都很厉害。
补充：鉴于很多朋友比较关心，我查询并记起了当年ssg拿三号种子的大致过程。
2017年的lck是SSG，AFS，MVP三支队伍打冒泡赛，其中的胜者再和kt打，才能获得最后一个名额。
当时LZ一号种子，SKT二号种子。然后ssg赢了afs和mvp中的胜者后（我印象中好像是afs赢了），还要和kt再打才有资格拿到三号种子。而kt众所周知是当时的银河战舰，看看这豪华阵容：
smeb是当时世界第一上单，即便在s8也能按着duke杀，和巅峰the shy打得有来有回。打野score是老牌野王了，中路是刚从edg回去的佛祖pawn将军，下路飞行员deft+号称最强大脑的曾获得S4世界冠军的fmvp获得者mata。当时kt还有个笑话，叫LPL三杰，意思是：从LPL回来的三个都是菜逼（pawn，mata，deft），全靠smeb和老队长在c

再看看afs有多强？SKT刚拿下三冠，风头正盛，lck也是当之无愧第一赛区，而当时afs是全世界对skt胜率最高的队伍！比抗韩奇侠闪电狼还高不少！我记得那年春季赛afs遇到skt基本没输过，把我看蒙了，心想马大头打老东家是真滴狠。

                    <span>最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。

与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。

虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。



游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。



《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。
最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。
说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。

虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。

Let&#x27;s face it. You can&#x27;t do everything. Or at least not efficiently in time. And time is one of the most valuable resources you have. That&#x27;s why many founders will tell you to find a co-founder for your idea. In most cases a mix of technical and sales based skillset would be very helpful. 
Since I work as a developer, it seems easy to find someone else with a technical background. And that&#x27;s how I met your... my co-founder.

                    <span>Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. 
Our mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future. Join our platform to learn more about what opportunities Interniac can offer you!

                    <span>BY NOW, most of the internet knows about the famous Log4Shell exploit, and if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s easy to get a sense of how disastrous it&#x27;s been. To drive the point home: the US Department of Homeland Security is warning people about it.
There&#x27;s been a lot of hand-wringing about how open source software, the lifeblood of many businesses today, is often totally unpaid and unthanked work, with some hot takes like &#x27;Open source needs to grow the hell up.&#x27; and &#x27;Open source&#x27; is broken.
What I want to touch on is something that&#x27;s been bothering me for the past few days, and solidified after seeing Bloomberg&#x27;s piece–the fact that the log4j developers had this massive security issue dumped in their laps, with the expectation that they were supposed to fix it. How did that happen? How did a group of sm…</span>

                    <span>When dealing with SQL databases, users will have to interact with different data types and schemas depending on the project&#x27;s requirements. Since databases are used in many different applications and support multiple platforms, devices, and users, there may be differences in how data is entered, even in a simple field like a phone number.
For example, one set of users will enter the phone number with the country code, while the others may simply ignore the country code. Therefore, it is essential for database users to know how to clean data in a SQL database. In this post, we will see how to utilize SQL string operations on phone number fields to properly clean, format, and extract data.
Data comes in all forms and sizes. Most of the time, it will be raw data, without proper formatting. Da…</span>

                    <span>I often read the term &quot;tutorial hell &quot; and I always wonder why so many people get stuck while I have so many ideas in my head for my own projects. Let me explain why I&#x27;ve never ended up in tutorial hell and how I come up with so many different ideas.
Of course, I watched a lot of tutorials during my learning journey, and I still do to gain more knowledge about certain things and improve my skills on a daily basis.
But even as I&#x27;m watching and following along with the tutorial, I&#x27;m already taking in the good things I could use from that tutorial in my head and thinking about how I could use them in one of my own projects.
A good example is the To Do List tutorial, which everyone seems to have enough of already. And actually, I don&#x27;t quite understand. If you watch a really good tutorial on h…</span>

                    <span>I had someone recently reach out to me to ask &quot;What is Suspense in the general sense?&quot; They said all they could find was React resources. And I told them that made sense they coined the term. But looking around I realized it was more than that.
When I look at the topic as explained in most articles it talks about the symptoms of the Suspense component but not really what it is. So I&#x27;m going to try to show today why it is so much more than a component that renders placeholders.
Consistent display of information is a fundamental expectation of a good user interface. If you show users inconsistent information within the same page(without indicating it) it erodes trust.

                    <span>不久前某刚到深圳的工友咨询深圳有无「正常」的披萨，就是只有番茄奶酪罗勒烤出来的，没有那些稀奇古怪顶料的简单披萨，大家推荐了许多店但几乎都不能完全满足这看似没有需求的需求。而我认为大家既然都已经是成熟的大人了，不妨自给自足？
有人戏说披萨就是中式馅饼的变种——它把馅儿给裹在了饼外面，或许是因为这个原因，以必胜客为主的中低端披萨店会给其做一些莫名其妙的改良，什么咖喱、麻辣甚至烤鸭披萨都常能见到，反而一些最基础的传统披萨被隐藏在菜单角落，并且味道也非常一般。
尝试过在家制作一次披萨后，大概猜到那些莫名其妙的「创意披萨」或许并不全是为了迎合中式饮食的噱头，而是基础披萨虽然制作简单并且食材普通，但它却非常需要耐心——而这往往是普通披萨店成本最高的地方。所以我想通过这篇文章和你分享如何在家自制披萨，我想你应该能学会，而我相信当你吃过这块「一点都不快」的披萨之后，再也对街边的披萨店提不起任何兴趣。
哪种披萨最好吃
当看到我说「在家自制披萨」时，想必你一定满头问号——做什么披萨？且不论前文提到出现在国内各个快餐店里稀奇古怪的创意披萨，就算是所谓的「传统披萨」，也分为美式披萨和意式披萨两大流派，再往下根据不同国家不同城市的流行饮食文化还演变出了各式各样的风味披萨，我不知道这世上有没有字面意思上「吃过所有披萨」的人，但我估计我这辈子都做不到。
所以在知道披萨种类其实非常丰富之后，我也和你一样问过同样的问题：哪种披萨最好吃？而现在其实我和工友一样只喜欢「正常披萨」，也就是那不勒斯披萨。
那不勒斯披萨从某种意义上你可以把它理解为意大利披萨的一种，它起源于意大利的那不勒斯，并且是受到了意大利官方承认和保护的饮食，类似于我们常听到的「非物质文化遗产」。而在 1984 年成立的「那不勒斯披萨认证协会（ACPN, Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana）」更是把那不勒斯披萨推…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 12 月 2 日，群晖在线上举办了名为 Synology 2022 AND BEYOND 的在线活动，和去年类似，由于疫情等诸多原因，群晖依旧选择在线上举办其发布会，相比去年 2021 年的发布会，群晖在本次线上发布会上介绍了未来的诸多软硬件更新内容，例如 DSM 7.1、C2 云服务、SRM 1.3 等，当然还正式发布了两款硬件产品，那么下面我们一起来回顾下本次线上发布会的诸多亮点和更新吧。
DSM 7.1
在过去的 2021 年，群晖正式发布了近年来其 DSM 操作系统最大的一次版本更新：DSM 7.0。全新的外观、更为安全的访问以及诸多系统新特性使得群晖 NAS 在更可靠安全的同时，也变得更为易用。而在 2022 年，群晖还会基于 DSM 7.0 推出其首个功能更新：DSM 7.1，主要聚焦在以下几个使用痛点上：
管理大规模部署
在 DSM 7.0 中，群晖发布了基于共有云的 web 端监控平台 Active Insight，你可以通过这个平台有效地了解到你的 NAS 设备的运行情况，而在 DSM 7.1 中，Active Insight 将会得到进一步的增强，比如说你可以用它来对多台设备进行大规模的集约化部署，统一管理系统更新和套件软件的更新。

同时在 Active Insight 还整合了更为智能的验证系统，可以根据使用习惯还预测并判断潜在的可疑登录，尤其是当登录地点和时间变得异常或者所有用户账户突然变成活动状态时，会及时通知 Active Insight 的管理员，并提供相对应的操作建议。

另外 Active Insight 还将加入监控 Hyper Backup 备份任务，这样对于需要管理多台设备的管理员，可以在一个界面下集中管理而无需手动检查每一台设备。进一步减少检查和管理的工作量。

                    <span>在国内定制系统几乎都已经经历过一轮变革的 2020 年年底，横空出世的 OriginOS 虽然难免给人一种「来晚了」的感觉，彼时它所交出的答卷依然让人惊喜，而如果站在现在的角度去看当时的 OriginOS，则不难发现它在启动器布局、桌面微件（widget）和自定义风格上的改造思路和实现路径甚至还有那么几分预见性：桌面微件在 iOS 和 Android 生态内重新得到重视、个性化表达在 Android 12 中成为一大主题……
OriginOS 对启动器主屏的重构令人印象深刻
2021 年，华容网格、原子组件、变形器，这几个在 OriginOS 中让人眼前一亮并迅速成为堪称 vivo 手机标志性功能的特性，又将迎来哪些打磨和创新？
12 月 9 日刚刚亮相的 OriginOS Ocean，就像它跳出常规「版本号」框架的命名方式那样，又一次在定制系统阵营中吹起了这么一阵新风。
玩转「符号」，将系统做成一本杂志
对去年少数派发布的 OriginOS 评测还有印象的朋友，应该知道 OriginOS 当初在大刀阔斧改造 vivo 手机系统桌面启动器的同时，也留下了不少让人担心的小问题，其中最明显的自然是系统整体设计风格上的割裂：华容网格和原子组件构建的新体验需要大量的第三方适配进行支撑、变形器虽然做得非常细致但依然没有处理好一些设计细节、启动器之外的其它部分缺少与之配位的打磨和润色……
关联阅读：OriginOS 上手体验：三个概念与它们所对应的问题
归根结底，虽然 OriginOS 在华容网格、原子组件等概念上极具巧思，但它们需要一套能够将整个 OriginOS 统一起来的设计语言。在我看来，这正是 vivo 在 OriginOS Ocean 中引入符号化设计语言的原因。这套符号化设计语言的理念源自杂志，参考对象的选择依然很巧妙——和大部分需要仔细阅读、浏览的内容相似，用排版设计的…</span>

背景概述
每次我想打盹儿的时候，几乎百分百会被媳妇的电话闹醒，但是困的时候老是忘记提前给媳妇打招呼，然后就被一阵巨大的响铃给震醒，导致不愉快。很多时候连勿扰模式也忘记开，还会被其它骚扰电话和钉钉电话闹醒。
最近研究了一下 iOS 15 推出的专注模式，结合日常生活场景做了这么个快捷指令，顺便把制作方法分享一下。
功能场景说明：运行后，手动选择计划小憩时长 30 分钟或其它时长，同时设置一个 30 分钟闹钟，发送一段文字内容通过短信和微信的方式通知给媳妇，时间到了自动结束小憩专注模式，顺便响起闹钟。

懒得看文章的可以快速自取 ：我要小睡一会儿

准备内容

快捷指令
一个女朋友及其手机号码和微信好友

配置过程
设置专注模式
所有 app 都不允许通知，所有设备之间共享，就是包括 Mac 电脑以及 Apple Watch 都同步状态。

选项配置，连三分钟内第二个来电都要禁止，因为前些年用手机号注册过法人，日均十个各类骚扰电话，打不通他们大概率还会再打一次，所以必须关闭。

快捷指令取变量做信息
整体逻辑就是，打开的时候选择想要小憩的时长，然后自动化其它操作。所以，第一部分就是选择时长的指令，这块也能自己改成一个手动输入项目，选择自己想睡的时长。

然后，需要两个在短信通知中发送给媳妇的重要变量——从 X 点睡到 Y 点，即通知超过这个时间之后电话才可以被打通。
通过「日期」脚本就能获取实时时间，通过「调整日期」就可以把时间修改为结束小憩的时间。通过一个「文本」脚本即可把两个关键变量和信息文案进行整理。

注意在时间变量可以按下图配置一下，这样就可以把冗余的日期信息去除了，短信内容结果呈现就是 xx:xx。

消息发送
第一个「信息发送」脚本就不多说，第二个「微信发送」在 Mac 端是不支持的，操作方法是在手机端先用 Siri 喊一句：

微信发送「要说的话」给「具体对象名字」。

Siri 这么操作成功一次之后，在快捷指令的脚本建议里面就自动出来了可选项，然后按「信息发送」脚本一样操作即可。

其它自动化
这部分就用默认的脚本选择专注模式结束时间，以及创建闹钟基础脚本即可。

心得体会及踩坑
Mac 端和 iOS 端的脚本还是存在一些割裂和 bug，例如我在 iOS 上设置了微信发送，在 Mac 端打开了一下工程文件，手机上再打开就会默认变成了企业微信发送消息，企业微信好友没有媳妇微信然后就报错了（那说明也可以用企业微信定时来给真领导发送汇报了）。

Mac 端无法直接使用闹钟脚本，搜半天发现压根就不在候选里面，微信和企业微信也是没法直接搜到的。

                    <span>3 年前，Apple 发布了 Apple Watch Series 4，升级了更大显示屏的同时，也带来了心电图功能。然而，国行版本的手表却与它无缘 —— 倒不是说硬件不支持，而是在软件上需要适配及审核。
直到今天，Apple 在最新的 iOS 15.2 和 watchOS 8.3 系统中，终于将过审已久的心电图功能带到国行 Apple Watch 上。除了心电图之外，iOS 15.2 其实还有不少值得关注的功能，一起来看看吧。
国行 Apple Watch 支持心电图
盼望着，盼望着，心电图终于来了。只要你的手表是 Apple Watch S4 及之后的款式，在升级了 watchOS 8.3 和 iOS 15.2 之后，就可以在 iOS 设备的「健康 &gt; 浏览 &gt; 心脏」中打开它。稍等一会，Apple Watch 上便会出现心电图 App。
如果你先前已经通过各种方式开通了心电图功能，更新后不会受到影响。

要使用心电图也很简单，只需佩戴好手表后打开心电图 App，将另一只手的食指放在数码表冠上，30 秒之后就能完成检测，同时检测结果也会即时同步到 iOS 设备的健康 App 中。你可以在健康 App 中将心电图导出为 PDF 文件提供给医生作为参考。
不过需要重点注意：Apple Watch 并非专业医疗设备，心电图检测的结果只能参考，不能用于诊断心脏病等疾病。如果对检测的结果有疑问或有身体不适，还是尽快咨询医生为好。

另外值得一提的是，此次国行 Apple Watch 的心电图功能，全称为「移动心电图房颤提示软件」，且软件版本为 V1，支持检测正常心率下的房颤。而目前最新的软件版本为 V2，除了支持 V1 版本的功能外，还能够检测高心率下的房颤。

App 隐私报告可视化
在以往的 iOS 15 系统中，App 隐私报告这一功能就已经存在了。只不过彼时我们只能选择导出…</span>

Apple 推送一系列正式版系统更新
12 月 14 日，Apple 开始向旗下产品推送新一轮正式版系统。
iOS/iPadOS 15.2 新增了 Apple Music 声控方案，还包括了「App 隐私报告」与 Apple ID「数字遗产」等功能。iPhone 13 Pro 与 iPhone 13 Pro Max 用户现在可以在设置中启用微距照片控制，用于切换到超广角镜头拍摄微距照片与视频。iPadOS 15.2 允许用户将快速备忘录的触发角改为左下角。此外还包括一系列功能与错误修复。
macOS Monterey 12.1 正式上线 SharePlay 功能，并修复了播放 HDR 视频可能导致崩溃、MagSafe 充电失灵等问题。值得一提的是「通用控制」再次延期，未能在该版本上线。此外，Apple 为老机型推送了 macOS Big Sur 11.6.2 以及 macOS Catalina 安全更新 2021-008，该补丁修复了一个可以绕过 macOS 安全机制的重大问题。
HomePod 15.2 软件更新增加了荷兰语及俄语 Siri，并支持新推出的 Apple Music 声控方案。
watchOS 8.3 除隐私报告与声控方案等更新外，还带来了此前获批的 ECG 功能。Apple Watch Series 4 及以后的机型（除 Apple Watch SE 外）现可使用移动心电图房颤提示软件，单通道心电图波形与相关分类及症状都会记录在「健康」App 中。来源

                    <span>便利店无美食推荐指南
比如总是被“夸”的便利店便当


好像大家对便利店盒饭总是有莫名的期待
而全家、711、罗森的便当，鸡腿、猪排、意面…
从外表看，确实让人很有食欲


这么多肉，却只卖十几块
花很少的钱，就能吃饱又吃好



“世界上竟然有这种好事儿”
当这个想法出现时
故事的走向一般都是
“果然没有这种好事儿”



2年多前，胖崽做过一次全家便当的差测评
这次我又用了大概一周的时间
吃了全家所有的便当



你们觉得这些好看的便当皮囊下
有几款藏着“好吃”的灵魂


西式口味饭

芝士猪排咖喱饭、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭、黑椒香煎猪排饭
这三款饭，无论名字还是卖相
看上去，都觉得真香
…
但眼见就一定为实吗
那我追过的cp，就不会怎么看都真的是爱
实际却根本不存在



1、芝士猪排咖喱饭

13块8
与2年前比，猪排口感有进步
虽然同样比较干，但更像“肉”了
味道依然完全不像肉，吃出了点咸味



猪排勉强能吃，咖喱真的难吃
全家，你是在画咖喱吗
颜色像咖喱，味道跟咖喱根本不相关
吃起来很奇怪，味道很复杂
有点点奶，有点点咸，完全不下饭



2、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭

15块8
这个皮，感觉应该烤箱再烤20分钟
而不是微波炉加热就能吃
唉，这是鸡腿皮，又不是脸皮
为什么我也想不要呢



本来鸡腿够大，还有甜味香肠
这款饭吃起来还挺饱，挺满足
但，饭里又加了同款怪味咖喱
这个咖喱吃起来的感觉
真的让我误会是不是加了恒河水
复杂、一言难尽



3、黑椒香煎猪排饭

12块8
啊，这猪排，真的成了精
我这凡人之躯，确实感受不出猪的原型
不知道自己在吃什么肉



但粉丝跟豆角味道还算正常
有蛋味跟油味的煎蛋
是全家盒饭里，最好的荤菜



中式口味饭

西式的饭不太行，吃吃看中式口味



1、香冒肥牛饭

14块8
来，你们看看这片肉
隔着屏幕，吃不到，是不是很难受
那我们感同身受
…
因为我看着这片肥牛
却也吃不出肥牛的味道



味道偏辣
对于广东胃来说，是非常辣
比较下饭吧



2、孜然牛肉鸡排双拼饭

奥尔良鸡肉、孜然牛肉、蛋皮、甜洋葱、胡萝卜…
聚在一起，什么都有
然后，每一款都做得不怎么样
这不是盒饭，是饭堂
即使只卖15块8，我也觉得不值



烩饭

烩饭是全家新款便当
一盒13块8
两款都比较清淡


菌菇鸡肉烩饭

味道像清鸡汤味的浓汤宝


番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭

基本就是微微的酸味
可以吃吧



面
吃完了饭，我们来吃面
一共吃了5款
包含意面、拌面、泡面、不知道什么面

其实都不用说出口
煮好，冷藏，微波炉再加热吃的面条
这是做好了，等ta，等到冷掉的饭菜
确实热热还能吃，但就是吃得不开心啊
所有的面条口感都很糟糕，大部分很软





1、奥尔良风味鸡肉意面

11块8
这盒面，要上天



“您好，这是本次航班配送的餐食”



完全就是经济舱鸡肉意面的样子跟味道
鸡肉就是飞机餐鸡肉口感
调味酸酸甜甜
只有翱翔在蓝天，才愿意下咽



2、大块鸡排京味炸酱干拌面

11块8
本来炸鸡排的口感应该是：说出“我喜欢你”前一刻的心跳
热切，跳个不停
用微波炉翻热的炸鸡排
…
是听到“对不起”后一刻的心跳
心如死灰的静
…
完全不香
京味炸酱就吃出了咸


3、港式餐蛋捞丁

这11块8，花得不值
午餐肉，薄到，我都害怕
它会从我的牙缝溜走
…
唯一的优点是捞丁用的酱
有蒜蓉，所以味道没那么单调



4、黑椒牛肉炒意面

只要9块8
所以买不了吃亏买不了上当
诶诶诶，想啥呢
不该花的钱一分不能花
这盒面，很干，还只吃出黑胡椒的冲辣



5、黑椒牛柳拌面

最好，也最贵，13块8
虽然主要也是黑胡椒味
但酱汁拌匀后，面条比较湿润，口感会好一些




总 结
分量来说，全家的盒饭
大部分一个都吃不饱



非要选的话，如果旁边没有超市快餐
饭我选番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭
面的话，嗯，不如选便利店里的车仔面


最后，发自内心地说
其实全家的便当非常适合我吃
因为社畜，就该吃些非人的食物




这次重测，一大原因是上次测评发出后的回应，让那篇测评可以归入“我找骂系列测评”。
所以这期，我先“反击”



以上纯味道评价，你可以认为好吃，但别用“加班后深夜的全家”等附加情感因素反驳我；
因为用“感情”反击，从“道理”上，就已经输了

                    <span>记者从退役军人事务部了解到，退役军人事务部近日正式印发《退役军人、其他优抚对象优待证管理办法（试行）》（以下简称《优待证管理办法》）。
《优待证管理办法》指出，为规范退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象优待证（简称优待证）制发、使用和服务管理，维护持证人权益，提高优待服务管理水平，依据《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》和国家有关规定，制定本办法。
《优待证管理办法》明确，优待证分为“中华人民共和国退役军人优待证”、“中华人民共和国烈士、因公牺牲军人、病故军人遗属优待证”两种，分别面向符合条件的退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象发放。优待证是持证人彰显荣誉的载体、享受优待的凭证。
据了解，2020年1月，退役军人事务部等20部门联合印发《关于加强军人军属、退役军人和其他优抚对象优待工作的意见》，提出“建立优待证制度”，逐步为退役军人和“三属”（烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属）统一制作颁发优待证。2021年1月1日起施行的《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》，将国家发放优待证写入法律。
《优待证管理办法》共9章、52条，3个部分。第一部分为总体要求，包含第一、二章，共16条。明确了优待证制发的目的依据、相关定义、适用范围、工作原则、信息支持、职责分工、功能等。
第二部分为优待证各个环节的工作要求，包含第三至八章，共32条。明确了申请、审核、制发、补换、收回、监督管理等全周期过程的要求。
第三部分为附则，即第九章，共4条。明确了遗属界定、施行时间等。（人民网记者何淼）

                    <span>一证虽小，意义非凡！！
自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。
因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。
退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： 
一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇
当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。
退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。

在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。
但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。

二、光荣的象征
 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。
 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。
对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。
三、身份的证明
 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。
 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。
 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。
四、全国通用
近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。
而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。
不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 
退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。

而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！

Nicolas Cage stars as... Nick Cage in the action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones. With a career built for this very moment, the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nick Cage.</span>

The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the universe seems empty. Devoid o…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched! And I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to come up with a game plan for where the Multiplayer should be headed from here on out. This is more or less, what I think 343i should do and prioritize for the next... however long. So check the time stamps if there&#x27;s something in particular you want to see me talk about.

                    <span>Data Structures and Algorithms are a very important topic for every beginner programmer to learn about. 
Data structures and algorithms are two terms that are often mentioned in the same sentence. In a data structure, you will find the different types of data, such as arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, and trees. What exactly are they? How do they work? How can you use them to solve real-world problems? 
To answer these questions, this article will provide 8 types of data structures and algorithms that you might encounter in your everyday life. The article starts by giving the basics for each data structure or algorithm before explaining its function. As an example for each type of data structure or algorithm, we’ve included a brief case study where it has been used.

This post is a short made-up, based on a real experience. It aims to show different approaches to developing and maintaining React components in an application.
In order to use react-select in a french government project, we have to translate placeholders and other default options. As far as I know, there is no i18n extension for react-select; anyway, it may not have fit our need since there may be some domain-specific text. Here we go, let&#x27;s use the component&#x27;s props:
 &quot;Chargement…&quot;}
  noOptionsMessage&#x3D;{() &#x3D;&gt; &quot;Aucun résultat&quot;}
  placeholder&#x3D;&quot;Choisissez une valeur&quot;
  // …
/&gt;

It works. 
👉 Now, we want to re-use this component with same options elsewhere, then everywhere else.
We could create a MySelect that has some default options. Since the only …</span>

React Hooks provide us with access to core React functionalities within the context of function components. Traditionally, to optimize React, developers have had to switch between function and class components, however, React Hooks allow us to use function components throughout projects to build both small and large applications.
If you’re a React developer who likes to write function components over class components, then this article is for you; we’ll look at three helpful yet somewhat underrated React Hooks that you might not be so familiar with, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, and useDebugValue. We’ll explore their use cases, syntax, and a few code examples. Let’s get started!

                    <span>Vendure is a modern headless e-commerce framework written in TypeScript and built on top of the excellent NestJS framework.
By &quot;headless&quot; we mean that it exposes an API (GraphQL in the case of Vendure), which allows you to build your storefront using your favourite front-end technology, be it Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or anything else you like!
Headless e-commerce has a somewhat justified reputation of being more complex and development-intensive than off-the-shelf SaaS solutions like Shopify. But with Vendure we aim to cut down your development time to the bare minimum with a combination of:
a rich set of features
integrations with existing solutions
optimal developer experience
modern technologies and workflows

                    <span>Monads were created by mathematicians in 1960 and rediscovered by computer scientists in 1990 as a new way to handle effects. Let&#x27;s write some examples, imagine a function that gets the tail from a list like this:

The problem here is obvious, this function can fail if he receives an empty list, now imagine that for any reason we&#x27;re using this function in our program to work with lists and for some reason, it receives an empty list, in this case, our program will break and the language compiler will give to us an exception, so how to solve this? to solve this we can use the Maybe Monad, let&#x27;s write this:

Now we have the function safeTail which is total, which means that this function will never fail, even if receives an empty list. As you can see Maybe Monad is like a box that encapsulate…</span>

Personally, my primary motivation to try out Neovim was: 
Reducing load on my machine.
Have the experience of using Vim/NeoVim as my IDE.
To be curios about why Vim/Neovim is so special.
Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim source code to achieve the following goals:
Simplify maintenance to improve the speed that bug fixes and features get merged.
Split the work among multiple developers.
Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any modifications to the core source.
Improve the extensibility power with a new plugin architecture based on coprocesses. Plugins will be written in any pr…</span>

                    <span>As all those of us involved in the field of Computer Science know or should know, Git is by far the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. We utilized it in our everyday routine to keep track of our code changes and helps us to work with other developers simultaneously and independently. 

Although modern IDE and various tools provided by GitHub, Atlassian and other provide us an easy to use way to perform many git commands nothing compares to the power a terminal provides. Bellow you can find a list of my top git commands.
# This will pop up an editor window allowing us to pass the new commit message
git commit -amend 

# This will not pop up the editor
git commit -amend -m &quot;Your new commit message&quot;

# Add the file
git add the_file_you_want_to_add
# Amend without changing commit message
git commit --amend --no-edit

git reset --hard 

git cherry-pick 

git log -n 
# example git log -n 3
# or

                    <span>In this articles I would like to share with you the process of development of the latest game that I developed called Cuzzle (cube + puzzle &#x3D; Cuzzle) ReactJS, this game was inspired by the original game called cuzzle developed by Redline Games
In this first part, I&#x27;m going to show you about the game and the different options it has.
In the second part, we are going to talk about the technical aspects and challenges in the development of this game.

You can play the game online here: https://cuzzle-react.vercel.app/
Cuzzle ReactJS is an isometric puzzle game, inspired by Sokoban, the 1981 transport puzzle game in which the player has to push boxes around a warehouse to get them into different locations. Cuzzle ReactJS add collapsing floors, switches, and some nice graphics.

Since the code is just a simple HTTP POST request, the longest part should have been the creation of the Twilio account (with a Regulatory Bundle and a phone number).
But in the end, it took me about one evening[1] to set up a development environment with the right dependencies, and then two more evenings to figure out which HTTP headers were needed.
Anyway, here is the script:

                    <span>Data Science is a growing field that has made it possible to extract meaningful information from data. Data scientists need programming languages in order to have the necessary tools for their job. In this blog post, we will talk about the best programming languages for data science and why they are so important!
R Language
Python
C++
Java
Wolfram Language
R, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.
Data science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code. These two languages are used by over half of all Fortune 500 companies so they&#x27;re worth getting acquainted with!

Shortery：Mac 上的快捷指令自动化工具

平台：macOS
关键词：快捷指令、自动化

@huhuhang：快捷指令作为 iPhone 上出色的效率应用，终于在今年被 Apple 带到 Mac 平台。从长期来看，快捷指令也大有替代 Mac 原本的 Automator 的趋势。当然，由于 iOS 和 macOS 平台的属性不同，快捷指令在二者中的功能也不完全一致，并非简单的移植。例如你可以从菜单栏和访达中快速访问 Mac 版本的快捷指令，同时又缺失了 iOS 版本具有的自动化功能。

虽然官方尚未在 Mac 版的快捷指令中添加自动化触发选项，但第三方应用 Shortery 正好可以弥补这点不足。

Shortery 提供了七种不同的触发器来运行快捷指令：

应用程序启动和退出：当你启动或退出一个应用程序时运行快捷指令。
时间：设置快捷指令运行的时间，并定义它的重复频率。
唤醒和睡眠：在你的 Mac 进入睡眠或醒来后运行快捷指令。
登录：用户登录时触发，开始全新的一天。
键盘：定义一个全局热键并从任何应用程序中触发它。
外观：当你的 Mac …</span>

                    <span>「互联网正在着火」？
如果你多少关注信息安全资讯，或许在最近几天已经频繁听到 Log4Shell 这个漏洞的名字——或者一些更具传播性的说法，诸如「互联网正在着火」「过去十年最严重的漏洞」「现代计算机历史上最大漏洞」「难以想到哪家公司不受影响」之类（参见《洛杉矶时报》，12 月 10 日）。

这个被报道得神乎其神的 Log4Shell 漏洞（CVE-2021-44228）所针对的，是一个极为常用的 Java 库 Log4j（详见后文说明）。值得一提，这个漏洞最初是由一名中国工程师、阿里云安全团队的 Chen Zhaojun（微博）在 11 月下旬发现并提报的。
有记录的利用 Log4Shell 漏洞发起的攻击开始于 12 月 9 日，最初是针对微软的 Minecraft 游戏 Java 版。但人们很快发现 Log4Shell 的波及范围远不止于此。根据 GitHub 仓库 YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface 中的攻击案例截图，Apple iCloud、QQ 邮箱、Steam 商店、Twitter、百度搜索等一系列国内外主流服务或平台均存在该漏洞。

好在，Log4j 已经于 12 日发布 2.15.0 版本，修复了漏洞，并且对于暂不能升级的旧版提供了临时应对方案。
受影响的大型平台也作出快速响应。10 日，Minecraft 发布 1.18.1 版，说明已修复了漏洞；亚马逊发出安全警告称，「正积极监控该问题，并已在寻求解决方案」；IBM、Red Hat、甲骨文、VMware 等知名科技公司也宣称正在部署补丁；Apple 尽管没有官方回应，但根据 11 日的测试，原本受到影响的 iCloud 似乎也已经修复。此外，目前暂无因该漏洞导致重大安全事故的报道。
然而，由于该漏洞影响范围之广，受影响服务完成更新或修补仍需不少时间，因此近期内风险仍不可忽视。事…</span>

                    <span>不论是患者还是家属，对重症监护病房（ICU）那道厚厚的门档充满了恐惧，ICU 常被描述为「有去无回」的地方，现实中的「人间地狱」。在很多人的眼里，ICU 中各种生命支持设备维持下的患者是没有「灵魂」的，ICU 的医护人员是没有「人情」的，要问整个医院中最没有人文关怀的科室，ICU 必定站上榜首。
作为一名 ICU 医生，希望能通过这篇文章，带大家一起了解现代医疗下的 ICU 是怎样的一个地方。
重症监护病房的历史
ICU 在整个现代医学的发展中属于一股新生力量，在 1950 年左右，为了拯救脊髓灰质炎导致呼吸衰竭的患者，才出现第一批具有现代医学意义上的 ICU 雏形。随着医疗技术的逐步发展，才在之后的数十年中逐步创立了重症监护病房。而中国第一个 ICU 病房则是在 1982 年于北京协和医院设立的，创建之初是只有 1 张床位的外科ICU，之后的 2 年，才创立了拥有 7 张床的 ICU 中心，从此开启了中国重症监护医学的元年。
在创立之初，由于患者需要大量的麻醉治疗、呼吸机治疗等方面的支持，ICU 大部分医生是由麻醉医生构成的，此时的ICU更多扮演着麻醉科附属科室的角色。随着 2003 年严重呼吸系统综合征 SARS、2005 年禽流感、2008 年汶川地震等重大公共卫生安全事件的相继爆发，大量危重症患者需要 ICU 的支持治疗，使得重症医学迅速发展壮大，2009 年正式认定为临床医学的二级学科，成为中国现代医学重要的组成部分。

经过接近一个月的开发工作，Switshot 2.0 版本终于正式地与大家见面。
相较于「简陋」的 Switshot 1.x 版本，Switshot 2.0 可以说是完全重构的版本。不仅在 1.x 版本中出现的诸多问题被统一修复，新版本还新增快捷指令功能，并为之后的媒体管理增强功能打下基础。
首先，介绍一下 Switshot
Nintendo Switch 11.0.0 固件更新为 Nintendo Switch 带来「发送至智能手机」功能。这个功能本质上是在 Switch 上启动一个 WLAN 热点和一个 Web 服务器，让手机连接到热点并访问服务器的资源（截屏和录制）。但是这个功能并没有想象中那么好用：除了需要扫描两次 QR 码之外，它将截屏和录制保存到手机上的方式也很原始：给你一个网页，让你长按保存……
老任啊，你这个发送功能，是来搞笑的吗？
后来，有人做了一款 Android app，可以直接读取 Switch 发送过来的媒体列表然后直接保存。对老任这个传输网页进行一点点 inspect 工作，发现 Switch 实际上会提供一个 JSON 列表，列表中包括在 Switch 中传过来的文件地址。
那么，下面就是「我上我也行」时间。我当即做了一个 快捷指令，自动读取 JSON 列表然后保存到图库。
最开始做 Switshot 非常机缘巧合：它是我做另外一款 app、等待 App Store 审核期间花半天时间摸出来的玩意，目的和上面提到的 app 和快捷指令一样：只需要扫一次码，就能一次性地把媒体保存起来。之后，我收到身边朋友…</span>

严重远程代码执行漏洞影响国内外大型公司服务
12 月 10 日，一个旧版 Apache Log4j 2 远程代码执行漏洞细节被公开。Log4j 是一个用来记录日志信息的 Java 框架，被大量项目用于业务系统开发。该漏洞利用了 Log4j 对日志内容的递归解析功能，使得攻击者无需特殊配置即可直接构造恶意请求，触发远程代码执行漏洞，漏洞利用。受到影响的服务包括微软的 Minecraft 游戏、亚马逊的 AWS 云服务多项功能，Apple iCloud 以及国内的百度搜索、QQ 邮箱等服务经测试亦受影响。

目前 Apache Log4j 官方已发布安全通告（CVE-2021-44228），并发布 Log4j 2.15.0 版本，对主要引发漏洞的 JNDI 功能强化默认安全设置，从而修复了漏洞，并针对旧版提出了补救建议，但受影响厂商完成更新或修补预计仍需时间。来源

                    <span>大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。
非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。
我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。
首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。



其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~

厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。

对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。
最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～

                    <span>如此有价值的一个问题不光没几个人答，而且先前仅有的两个回答居然都在胡说八道……这不能忍，怒答一发。
羽毛球世界杯赛的“停办”在历史上一共有两次，一次是1997-2005的暂时停办，一次就是2006年后至今的无限期永久停办，而这两次停办背后的原因其实是完全不同的。
这项赛事最初的举办是在1981年——那一年的另外一个重大历史事件就是原国际羽联IBF和原世界羽联WBF正式合并成新的国际羽联IBF（也就是现在我们熟悉的新世界羽联BWF的前身），而它的首次停办是在1997年，这期间一共举办了17次比赛，但可能出乎很多人常识认知范畴之外的是，这17次比赛的主办方其实并不是世界羽联IBF，而是总部位于美国纽约的国际管理集团IMG。

由此我们也可以得知，1997年的羽毛球世界杯赛停办，其背后的根本原因应当是由于作为主办方的IMG集团内部的业务变更与项目调整，尽管具体的情况目前已不得而知，但可以想见国际羽联对于这次停办的话语权应当不是很大的。
然而新世纪以来在湖南益阳分别于2005年和2006年举办的第18和第19届世界杯赛的情况以及世界杯赛在那之后的第二次停办，其背后的原因则与前文所述大相径庭。

首先不同于以往的是，这两届世界杯赛事的重启已经不再经过原本作为赛事主办方的IMG集团的点头，而是在当时由国际羽联IBF方面自行牵头、并同时联合我国的一些大型国有企业与地方私营企业（譬如中国移动和赛琪体育等）进行合作规划从而最终得以实现的，同时在性质上也被重新认定是不计世界排名积分的“邀请赛”——尽管从届数上这两次比赛仍按第18、19届世界杯进行顺延，也就是名义上仍继承了此前于1997年停办的老世界杯赛的衣钵，但由于整个比赛重启之后一直带着一股抹不去的“非正式赛事”的味道，因此在公众看来其在此后进行常态化办赛的前景始终是不明朗的。
其次也是最主要的一点就是这两届“新世界杯”的赛制与赛事性质的定…</span>

Usually people search for patterns to follow but some of them are searching for the anti-patterns to avoid, In my opinion both are equally important, as by knowing them you are leveling up your skills in programming using a specific tool.
To understand what are the anti-patterns we need first to define what is a pattern. a pattern is usually a well known solution for a recurring problem, or we can first talk about the concept through a food metaphor.
This plate (for people who don&#x27;t know) is a street Egyptian food called &quot;Koshary&quot;, I picked it because it has quite a lot of ingredients including rice, pasta, hummus, lentil, tomato sauce, and more.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re just getting started with data science, then Python programming is a great language to start with. It&#x27;s the most popular programming language for data scientists and it has many powerful packages, libraries and frameworks that are designed specifically for their needs. In this post, we&#x27;ll take a look at some of the best tools out there - so read on if you want to get up-to-speed quickly!
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides an efficient and comprehensive array-processing facility that can handle large multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy also contains high-level mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and other operations.

                    <span>First, create a new project.
CD into the project folder and run npm init. Follow those steps until you&#x27;re done.
Run: npm i mongodb. This will install the official MongoDB driver for Node.
Create an index.js, or main.js, depending on your main file when you ran npm init.
Inside there: add this:
const {MongoClient} &#x3D; require(&quot;mongodb&quot;);
const mongouri &#x3D; &#x27;mongodb://your_connection_string&#x27;;
const client &#x3D; new MongoClient(mongouri);

client.connect().then(console.log(&quot;Connected to MongoDB&quot;));

Congrats, if you run node ., you should see &#x27;Connected to MongoDB&#x27;.
Let&#x27;s create a quick question database by using an asynchronous function. Add this above client.connect().then(console.log(&quot;Connected to MongoDB&quot;)); and under the constants:

A Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger network that is cryptographically secured.
Think of it as a database where different features can be built on such as coins, apps etc and no single entity has control over it. This allows for transparency, security and gives everyone full control of their assets.
We have 3 major types of networks in computing, they are:

In a centralized network, all the data and information is regulated by a single entity. Example Facebook, WhatsApp etc they are all centralized.
In a decentralized network, different nodes on the network have equally control and the source of Truth is checked on the network to ensure that everyone …</span>

                    <span>Podemos identificar padrões em uma cadeia de caracteres usando Expressões Regulares (Regular Expression ou RegEx).
Para validar o formato de um CPF, por exemplo, é necessário que esteja no seguinte padrão:
xxx.xxx.xxx-xx (cada x corresponde à um dígito decimal)
Então através de uma RegEx conseguimos identificar se esse padrão foi seguido ou não.
Usando a linguagem de programação Python, importa-se o módulo re que fornece operações de expressões regulares.
import re

Cria-se uma função validar a qual recebe uma string cpf, ela retorna válido ou inválido.
def validar(cpf):
    validador &#x3D; expressao.match(cpf)
    if validador:
        return &#x27;válido&#x27;

                    <span>For release 0.4, I decided to take the the time to participate in the 2021 GitHub Action hackathon and continue to contribute to Telescope.
About the same time we worked on integrating GitHub Continuous Integration into our SSG project, GitHub announced they are holding 2021 GitHub Action hackathon in collaboration with Dev. This year, we’re encouraged to utilize existing GitHub Actions to create workflows solutions other developers can utilize to solve problems with open source. My submission was a workflow to run code linter and formatter on only changed files and run test on only changed workspaces of a monorepo. I used what learned from building an SSG in OSD600 to build this project. After all, I walked away having a deeper understanding of GitHub actions, from exploring many existing actions, to building a useful one and publishing it to GitHub marketplace.
The other contributions were for improving website accessibility and responsiveness in Telescope. These fixed some of the minor issues I encountered while using Telescope myself.

If you&#x27;ve been following programming and data science, you&#x27;ll probably be familiar with sentiment analysis. If you&#x27;re not, here the definition:
The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer&#x27;s attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
Sentiment analysis programs have become increasingly popular in the tech world. It&#x27;s time you make one for yourself!

                    <span>One of the major challenges in software engineering is documentation. After all, software is not only about code but the documentation that comes with it. It is a manual, costly process which should be human legible and comprehensible.
So why is documentation so important ? 
In this blog we will talk about some of the ways we can document code functionality in Python. 
Since Python is a dynamically typed language, coding modules for example a piece of code for a function can take any parameter values without any validations or checks. In some cases, the function name and parameters may be self-explanatory but how the parameters and function work may be unknown unless the code is read which can contain large number of complexities.Therefore having documentation on inputs and outputs of a fu…</span>

                    <span>简介
我基于stackedit的markdown编辑器制作了这款插件，由于官方markdown插件非常不友好，存在公式无法正确识别等一些问题，所以制作了这款插件，补充官方插件的不足。stackedit是采用了mermaid、katex引擎，满足一部分人对mermaid的需求。（Mermaid 是一个用于画流程图、状态图、时序图、甘特图的库，使用 JS 进行本地渲染，广泛集成于许多 Markdown 编辑器中。)
myMarkDown的使用效果
公式
与官方markdown插件不同，$输入你的公式$两个美元符号之间是内联公式，$$你的公式$$是块公式。
流程图
本款markdown插件采用mermaid引擎，所以想制作流程图请学习使用mermaid。
表格
与官方的markdown插件一样。
痛点需求
官方的markdown插件存在很多bug，目前这款stackedit还没发现bug；
由于窗口大小的限制，所以不同于官方markdown插件将左边为输入区，右边为preview，而是采用了整个窗口都为输入区，需要查看preview时点击一个按钮即可查看。

                    <span>Windows 沙盒是内置于 Windows 部分版本中的一次性 Windows 虚拟机，它简单免费，启动速度快，并且用完即删。在需要使用不适合安装在实体机器上的应用、亦或者测试安全性未知的文件时，Windows 沙盒都是非常实用的工具。
然而，和真正的虚拟机相比，它的自定义空间「似乎」很小：沙盒默认屏蔽了摄像头和打印机，如此一来部分应用就无法运行；想要在沙盒中安装软件要么从主机复制安装包，要么再次下载；由于沙盒是一次性的，有用的文件还要在销毁沙盒前手动复制进主机……
幸运的是，以上问题都能通过专属于 Windows 沙盒的配置文件解决。Windows 沙盒配置文件为纯文本，后缀名 .wsb，可以用于定义沙盒的 vGPU 状态、网络信号、文件夹映射等属性。下文将通过三个具体实例演示配置文件的使用方法。最后一节会列出所有可用配置项供大家参考。
Windows 沙盒的开启方法请参考此文：

Windows 10 五月更新即将推送，浅色模式、沙盒和新的搜索功能都要来了

用例一：允许沙盒应用使用摄像头，临时运行视频会议应用
让我们从最简单的例子开始讲起，介绍配置文件的新建和使用流程。
假设我们需要在沙盒中运行一个视频会议软件，默认情况下，鉴于一些安全问题，沙盒屏蔽了应用对摄像头的访问。因而下面我们需要配置沙盒允许视频输入。

在桌面通过右键新建一个文本文件。确保你能看到该文件的后缀名 .txt。如果看不到，需要勾选 文件资源管理器 &gt; 查看（顶部） &gt; 显示 &gt; 文件扩展名。

双击此文件进入编辑界面。输入：

 Enable

                    <span>每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。
当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。
总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……

作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。
从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。

大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。
锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。

然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。
早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？
据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。

其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。
以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。

在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！

                    <span>The Vision, which was often carefully cleaned with flannel, had once been taken away from Arataki Itto.
But Itto has never been discouraged. On the contrary, after overcoming various hardships to regain his elemental power, his fighting spirit has burned even brighter.
Yes, that&#x27;s right. I guess his mettle is exactly what makes him the boss of the Arataki Gang.

                    <span>One thing I&#x27;ve seen across many designer/design studio websites are a cool custom cursor in place of your default computer one. Recently, I added one to my website aswell.
I had to write one from scratch (using some internet resources of course!), since all the NPM libraries I found were either outdated, or didn&#x27;t support SSR.
After adding the cursor to my own website, I had an idea to create an NPM package for it for a while. This weekend, I had some freetime from school &amp; got to work!
This library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js &amp; Remix)
Want a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak &amp; experiment around with values!
To download the library, head over to your terminal:
yarn add custom-pointer-react

Next, import the cursor component into your file &amp; customise it! Don&#x27;t forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.
import { Cursor } from &#x27;custom-pointer-react&#x27;
...
const Cursor &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    ...
    
    ...
  )
}
...
export default App

All parameters are optional, &amp; here&#x27;s a list of the different parameters which you can customise: 



Parameter
Description
Default




color
The background colour of the cursor
#000000


showRing
Controls whether to show the ring around the cursor
true


ringSize
Controls the size of the ring around the cursor
50px


cursorSize
Controls the size of the cursor
10px


ringBorder
Controls the width of the ring&#x27;s border
2px



Need help finding the right parameters? Check out the demo website!
Now, go into your app &amp; import the MouseContext provider.
import { MouseContextProvider } from &#x27;custom-pointer-react&#x27;
...
ReactDOM.render(
  
    
  ,
  document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)
)
...

Your custom cursor should be good to go!</span>

React for building the frontend.
Blueprint as our UI Library
Backend template from Canonic
GraphQL for fetching the data.
React-chartjs-2 for building charts.
Step 1: Getting started with the project
To create the project, we&#x27;ll use create-react-app. Execute the command below in a terminal to create the basic boilerplate setup. We&#x27;ll name our project marketing-dashboard.

                    <span>A new commit was made to the ParseJS repository, it contains an update that will prevent smaller tokens from potentially wrongfully being placed.
This is the bug in question:
parse_string(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, [&quot;Hell&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;]);
// Produces: [Symbol(Hell), &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, ...]

// But, this--
parse_string(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hell&quot;]);
// -- produces: [Symbol(Hello), &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;, ...]

Now, in this update, the order won&#x27;t matter, the longer token is always chosen if it can be.</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t write much about Angular but as I am working on a project that uses Angular at the moment I thought why not share a thing or two that I found interesting.
As someone who is definitely not an Angular expert I was looking for a clean solution on how to listen for element events that are part of a child component&#x27;s template.
This is of course quite a trivial thing but it might be of value to people who are starting with Angular and are facing the same problem.
Let&#x27;s start.
Situation:
We want to listen to child component input element&#x27;s events inside of the parent component. (do something with it in the parent)
Parent template code: (parent.component.html)

Child template code: (child.component.html)

                    <span>Hi Devs,
This is sort of new for me. I&#x27;ve never really been a business guy - more the kind of dude that just codes away behind the scenes - but I&#x27;ve been working on a really cool project and thought it fit to show the community. We also hit #1 on Hacker News, so I figured there was a fair bit of crossover :-)
Short description
1SecondPainting is an artificial intelligence art generator that lets people create their own, stunning quality paintings in seconds.  You can then purchase canvas prints, framed posters, or digital downloads (for NFTs). Every painting sold is 100% unique - you&#x27;re in full control of your art.
I combined some pretty cutting edge ML with a proprietary post-processing pipeline to deliver probably the highest quality art of this kind (in my opinion, though of course I&#x27;m biased).
A lot of people have called it unsettling &amp; kind of scary, which I agree with! If you&#x27;re interested, you can try it for yourself here. Let me know what you think :)
Thanks,
Nick</span>

                    <span>I have created a simple yet powerful command-line application to easily download an entire copy of any online website. 
It is coded with Go and it is available on my GitHub: https://github.com/antsanchez/go-download-web 
I normally use it to: 
Back up any website (at least the rendered part of the website)
Create copies of websites for accessing them offline
It also allows you to change the URL of the downloaded website, which can be very helpful when moving an existing static website from a domain to another. 
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

                    <span>In the process of setting up the development environment for Nuvolaris, I decided to switch from virtual machines to containers, leveraging the devcontainer feature of VSCode. Then I built a Docker image that is a perfect fit for our needs: there everything is in it to build our project.
But, I almost went on panic when I realized that, since a key component is an operator, and a cli that interacts with Kubernetes, we need to be able to access a Kubernetes cluster for development FROM a container.
In my initial plans, I would have setup a cluster Kubernetes in the virtual machine itself. But now, that everything is in a container? I actually felt initially very smart having the idea of setting up a Kubernetes cluster using kind. It is a tool that can build a Kubernetes cluster just using d…</span>

                    <span>故事要從 Python 的語言特性說起，因為 Python 是動態型別的，所以一個在同一個區塊（命名空間）內的變數 x，可以一下是字串，一下是整數：
x &#x3D; 4
print(type(4)) # at this moment, x points to an integer

x &#x3D; &quot;Hello, world&quot;
print(type(x)) # and at this moment, x points to a string

這樣的特性降低了 Python 的學習曲線，但在程式專案變複雜後，對於「值」與「型態」的掌握會越來越難以駕馭。
大約在 Python 3.5 起引入了 type hints，華文叫類型提示或型態提示，它讓我們得以聲明變數的型態，也可以聲明函式回傳值的型態。
有了 type hints，IDE 或是靜態分析工具就可以幫助我們偵測型態上的錯誤，也因為它只是 hints，所以它終究無法讓 Python 變成靜態型別語言，只是一種輔助而已。
下面是最基本的 type hints 範例：
name: str &#x3D; &quot;world&quot;

def greeting(name: str) -&gt; str:
    return &quot;Hello &quot; + name

greeting(name)

上面我們用 : str 聲明 name 為字串，以及在函式我們用 -&gt; str 聲明 greeting() 回傳的也是字串，當然還有更複雜的用法，可以參見〈Python Type Hints 從入門到實踐〉。
以上為前情提要，下面開始談本文的主角 Pydantic 。
Pydantic 是以 type hints 為基礎，幫我們做資料型態驗證的套件，我們可以用它定義「Model」：
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EmployeeModel(…</span>

                    <span>这篇文章将解决你以下几个疑问：
为什么要使用单例？
单例有哪些写法？
单例存在哪些问题？
单例与静态类的区别？
有何替代的解决方案？
为什么要使用单例？
单例设计模式（Singleton Design Pattern）如果一个类只允许创建一个对象（或者实例），那这个类就是一个单例类，这种设计模式就叫作单例设计模式，简称单例模式。
为什么我们需要单例这种设计模式？它能解决哪些问题？接下来我通过两个实战案例来讲解：
实战案例一：处理资源访问冲突
我们自定义实现了一个往文件中打印日志的 Logger 类。具体的代码实现如下所示：
public class Logger {
  private FileWriter writer;
  
  public Logger() {
    File file &#x3D; new File(&quot;/Users/mrHandson/log.txt&quot;);
    writer &#x3D; new FileWriter(file, true); //true表示追加写入
  }
  
  public void log(String message) {
    writer.write(message);
  }
}

// Logger类的应用示例：
public class UserController {
  private Logger logger &#x3D; new Logger();
  
  public void login(String username, String password) {
    // ...省略业务逻辑代码...
    logger.log(username + &quot; logined!&quot;);
  }
}

public class OrderController {
  private Logger logger &#x3D; new …</span>

年末囤货是广大人民群众喜闻乐见的一种娱乐形式，「双十一」的网购热潮还没完全消退，各大电商平台就已经纷纷开始为即将到来的「双十二」开启预热了。谈及两大购物节优惠力度最大的商品品类，笔记本电脑绝对是绕不过的话题。近年来，主流品牌的「静坐战争」、供应链的极尽成熟和 AMD Ryzen 处理器的强势崛起为众多非传统笔电厂商的入局创造了条件，因 COVID-19 新冠疫情防治工作而催生的居家办公和网课教育等专业需求则有力的推动了笔记本电脑的技术进步和市场细分，日薄西山的笔电行业竟在一夜之间「垂死病中惊坐起」，然而「铁马冰河入梦来」的滚滚矿潮很快将显卡乃至固态硬盘等核心硬件的缺货荒蔓延到了笔电市场，在市场价格与用户需求持续走高的大环境下，电商平台的年末大促俨然成了各大厂商的主战场，至于如何在这片战场上长驱直入和全身而退就成了用户需要考虑的问题。
想要购买到一台让自己心仪的笔记本电脑，在按下「立刻购买」前需要做的准备工作无外乎理清需求、估计预算、比较规格和确认细节，而在实际选购的过程中，以上四点中的前两者为必要条件，后两者则为充分条件。考虑到现在的笔电产品在目标价位和硬件规格上的表现相对直观，所以本文将从容易受到忽视的产品定位和设计细节进行筛选，本着宁缺毋滥的原则，为少数派们推荐一些称心好用的笔电产品。

                    <span>Intro


Learning how to use cloud servers and utilizing cloud computing is one of the must-have skills in current-day software development. There are plenty of options when it comes to cloud service providers, for example, Heroku, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services etc. Today, I am going to show how to spin up a cloud server on AWS, one of the most popular options and is used by many software companies.
First of all, AWS is very complicated and it has many tools that you will never need to use. For the purpose of just hosting a cloud server, we are going to focus on the tool AWS EC2.
Prerequisite: Make sure you already have an AWS account (duh)
Step1: Login to AWS and search EC2 and create an instance
Once you logged in to AWS, you are very likely to get lost from all of its options and …</span>

                    <span>What is Federated Learning


Federated learning is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.
Horizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples. For example, two regional banks may have very different user groups from their respective regions, a…</span>

                    <span>Hey DEV.to community!
It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve written on DEV.to but here I am again :)
GitHub Copilot is one of the most discussed matters in programming universe nowadays and I&#x27;ve finally got my hands on it.
During the time I&#x27;ve spent testing this awesome miracle I&#x27;ve thought about many things simultaneously and once I was thinking straight again I got frightened. It is a strange feeling how much programming has evolved since the days I&#x27;ve begun to program, how much the tools advanced, how much the frameworks and libraries became more efficient and made programming more enjoyable and easier. But then comes this revolutionary revolution! I know there were other AI code assistants before GitHub&#x27;s Copilot but this one is really something else.
Imagine how computers are made. They are ju…</span>

Deciding a use case you want to predict or know more about.
The objective is the first step which is decided based on business requirements.
Defining the objective sheds light on what kind of data should be gathered. It also helps us in judging what kind of observations are important while doing exploratory data analysis.
An objective should be clear and precise. Therefo…</span>

                    <span>Hello again my fellow artisans!!
In this article, I will go through the step-by-step process of how you can automate your Laravel app deployment on a VPS, for free of course.
I am a part of a small team working on a Laravel project which is deployed on a VPS. Each of our team members will work on a particular task and when it&#x27;s ready for production there is always a need for someone access to the server to deploy each change that is being pushed to our GitHub repo.
This become a very repetitive and unpleasant task for all of us and a solution was needed within our scale and budget, that&#x27;s when we turned to the mighty Github Actions to automate our workflows.
Let&#x27;s dive into the simplified version of our workflow setup guide.
In this guide, I assume you have the followings points in check.

                    <span>Adding CSS To Your HTML


For beginners … very picture heavy since CSS is such a visual discipline!
### Getting CSS Into Your HTML
To connect your CSS sheet to your HTML page, use the link tag like so.
Many developers use External pre-written CSS stylesheets for consistent design.
You can connect multiple stylesheets.
CSS Selector : Applies styles to a specific DOM element(s), there are various types:
Type Selectors : Matches by node name.
-   Class Selectors : Matches by class name.
-   ID Selectors : Matches by ID name.
-   Universal Selectors : Selects all HTML elements on a page.
-   Attribute Selectors : Matches elements based on the prescence or value of a given attribute. (i.e. a[title] will match all a elements with a title attribute)

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) has grown immensely popular with many of the world’s largest tech companies, like Netflix, LinkedIn and Airbnb employing SRE teams to keep their systems reliable and scalable.
Along the way, SRE engineers have become one of the most sought after engineering roles in tech. 
The role is traditionally understood as ensuring that services are reliable and unbroken, but reliability and uptime aren’t perfect metrics. Perhaps what organizations should be asking themselves is what their customers think of their service.

                    <span>What is SaaS?
SaaS, or Software as a service, alongside IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service), maybe a way of cloud-computing service delivery, where clients buy software, hosted on a foreign server, per each use or subscribers on a monthly or a yearly basis. There are three storage modes: public-cloud — when infrastructure is hosted by third-party data centers, private-cloud — within the companies network, and hybrid — a mixed approach.
The popularity of SaaS has been growing for thirty years. It appeared within the 70-is because computers were huge and very expensive, and many companies couldn&#x27;t afford to possess one. At that point, it had been called the &quot;time-sharing system&quot;- an early sort of the web as we all know it today. Within the next 20 years, despi…</span>

                    <span>In this post, we will create an SVG donut chart with clickable slices/parts. I will first explain the problem with the common way to implement an SVG donut chart (using stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset). 
stroke-dasharray implementation


Salomone Baquis talks about this in this post. This method uses the stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties to draw a slice of border around SVG circles. Read the post to see how he do it.
The problem is that we can&#x27;t interact we the slices. For example, we can&#x27;t change the color of the slice on hover or do something when the slice is clicked. 
z-index hides all the other elements below it. Have a look at the illustration below, and pay attention to the ID of the circle that is highlighted (42).

本周话题：元宇宙会成功吗
前不久，脸书的老板扎克伯格接受专访。
记者提问，为啥你们公司要改名为 Meta（元宇宙）？

记者的言下之意是，元宇宙这么虚幻的东西，科幻小说家炮制出来的概念。改成这个名字，你们会不会是一时头脑发热，追求时髦，能做成功吗？

扎克伯格的回答很棒，没有说外交辞令，而是说了两个很实在的理由，表明他认真算计过成功的可能性。
他说，根据统计，大多数美国成年人每天看电视（包括流媒体）或者玩电子游戏的时间，长达几个小时。电视节目或电子游戏，本质上都是提供了一个虚拟世界，让观众和玩家脱离现实，感受到快乐。
这表明人们愿意在虚拟世界里面，每天待上几个小时，哪怕现在的体验还非常初级。

第二个理由是，疫情期间，许多人都在家办公。以前，上班的目的地是办公室，现在变成了键盘和显示器。
这表明，人们可以在计算机前面工作8小时。如果能够提供更好的虚拟办公条件，这8小时完全可以在虚拟空间里面度过。

扎克伯格的结论就是，人们愿意待在虚拟世界，进行娱乐和工作。 元宇宙的需求真实存在，而且这种需求很大，只要能够创造更好的体验，就会诞生一个空前的市场。

我被扎克伯格说动了，突然意识到，虚拟世界真的很受欢迎，这是元宇宙可能成功的最大原因。
甚至可以这么说，如果我们把虚拟世界等同于元宇宙，那么可以发现，元宇宙早就成功了。
西游记是元宇宙。
星球大战是元宇宙。…</span>

[国产剧] 谁是凶手

关键词：悬疑 / 犯罪
片长：38 分钟（单集）× 16 集
观看渠道：爱奇艺；豆瓣链接

三人三色，好像每个人都有秘密。

@潘誉晗：今年爱奇艺「迷雾剧场」的几部剧集口碑都很低迷，《谁是凶手》虽然没有像《隐秘的角落》和《沉默的真相》引起现象级的关注与讨论，但也算是给今年的「迷雾剧场」做了一个不错的收尾。

                    <span>写在前面：

笔者对本作的体验覆盖了游戏首发至今的各版本，本文对游戏内容的描述基于最新的 1.31 版本；
本文包含情节、机制上的完全剧透，不建议未通关的玩家直接阅读；另外本文还包含了对剧集《真探 第一季》、小说集《猎魔人 - 命运之剑》中短篇小说《别的东西》的部分剧透，请酌情阅读相关文段；
本文的探讨仅围绕游戏内容，其产品宣传、不同平台质量差异等游戏外因素，均不属于本文涉及的范围；
由于笔者判断本作的中文翻译存在一些精准性问题，部分情况下可能遗漏、曲解英文表意，故下文涉及任务名称等处将优先使用英文。

相信对不少和笔者一样玩家来说，作为《巫师（The Witcher）》游戏系列的爱好者，在开启《赛博朋克 2077（Cyberpunk 2077）》（以下简称《2077》）的体验前，可能多多少少都抱着与对前者类似的预期。
关联阅读：风口浪尖上的 CDPR 和《赛博朋克 2077》，到底怎么了？
然而与期待大相径庭是，《2077》展现给玩家的将是比《巫师》更加直白、更加复合、更加深刻，甚至是更加苦涩的情绪体验。
断断续续差不多一年的游玩之后，在《2077》满周岁的这个档口，笔者终于完成了此文，试图从游戏的机制、流程、情绪传达等方面入手，探讨《2077》如何带给玩家一段美丽而永不消逝、令人难以忘怀的体验。
♫ I&#x27;ll be your mirror

如同游戏标题所昭示的，本作的故事主要发生在近未来的公元 2077 年，核心舞台是公司资本浇筑而成的超级都会「夜之城（Night City）」，在这个时代缩影般的一方天地里，玩家将扮演野心勃勃的佣兵 V，尝试扎根夜之城，最终，在自我价值实现、牵扯进公司阴谋、生命进入倒计时、与强尼·银手（Johnny Silverhand）建立起微妙关系等经历交织的漩涡中，踩出一条属于自己的出路。

                    <span>简单谈一谈个人的看法。
电影里的励志、鸡汤，其本身都不是原罪。重要的是，作品的励志与鸡汤是否真正地站在真实性的基础之上。只有客观而忠实地反映了真实，作品才有了励志与鸡汤的基本说服力。
《雄狮少年》，不是完全彻底的励志向作品，而它给出的真实反映水平，也是“不完全”的：拥有了对真实表象的呈现，却未能走到表象之下。理想与现实，传统文化与当代社会，精神信仰与物质压力，一系列的冲突，也就此停留在了“足够客观的表象展现”程度上。表象客观全面，已经在同类、国产作品里颇为少有，可称“不错”；而缺乏深度细化，则阻碍了它向更优秀之处的攀登脚步，必须报以一声“遗憾”。

这部作品的第一组镜头，便强化了自身的现实属性。在旁白的介绍里，舞狮是中国传统文化的象征存在，代表着曾经时代的光辉。然而，随着一句“主角却不是他”，就将现实的时代做了切换——一个长镜头跟随着骑车的男主角，扫过了破落的农村街景，以及衣衫褴褛的民众，让当代社会的时态呈现出来。曾经以舞狮为骄傲的传统时光已经不复存在，取而代之的，是在物质压力下被迫的生存之道，经济落后地区的家庭为了赚钱，家长只能背井离乡，去大城市打工，而诞生无数的留守家庭。
包括此时出现的主角形象，都在强调着现实的因素。他不是动漫主角常有的大眼美男，而是生活里比较普遍的单眼皮少年，其后，这种形象也延伸到了女主角扁塌的鼻梁上。这样的形象，让人物彻底回归了现实感最强的“普通”之中——他没有任何突出的地方，外形都如此平庸，也就不具备所谓的“被选中之子”之类的潜藏天赋。
而主角随后的遭遇，更是让这个信息有了更明确的落地。心怀舞狮憧憬的他，被称为病猫。而抢走他红包的舞狮队成员，一方面体现着舞狮这样的传统文化于物质化当代的变质，同时也反过来说明了舞狮衰落的原因——忙于赚钱的人们，不再对舞狮这样的东西抱有兴趣，这便让历史悠久的陈家村舞狮队，也丧失了自己本应具有的骄傲，物质功利了起来，以…</span>

每一个东北包子里
都包得下一盘菜
但凡能上桌的，一多半的菜都能被东北人包进包子里。



无论是绿油油的韭菜鸡蛋，还是油汪汪的酸菜白肉，哪怕是红烧排骨、大龙虾这种硬货，都是东北包子馅料的选项。


大菜包能有多少花样？
东北人对蔬菜有着非常庞大的定义，不是肉肉的，都算蔬菜家族。
但对于菜包子的定义来说，就没那么精准了。馅料全是蔬菜的，是菜包子；但以蔬菜为主，肉来增香的，也可以算进菜包子。





韭菜包、白菜包、酸菜包、大头菜包、茴香包和萝卜包、豆腐包等等，都是东北很常见的菜包子，根据个人喜好，还可以搭配上粉丝、鸡蛋或者猪肉碎。
尤其是酸菜，不仅能和白肉组成酸菜猪肉包，还能和白肉的二代产物——“油滋啦”组成油滋酸菜包。





冬季杀年猪后，东北人家会用猪肥肉来炼猪油，炸后的“油滋啦”不仅没有白肉那么油腻，还增添了一份脆爽的口感，和酸菜做包子馅，更是喷香十足。
再者，豆角猪肉包也是东北包子的一大特色。此豆角可非彼豆角：在南方，豆角多指豇豆；在东北，豆角多是那种短粗的扁豆、豆王或者叫芸豆，不同地方名字略有不同。



东北的豆角猪肉包，做起来有个关键要素，豆角要用热水焯成半熟，能很好的祛除豆腥味，也更容易蒸熟。豆角包在面皮里，不仅有一股豆香气，也让包子的口感更加丰富。
在东北大包中，玉米面菜包也很有特色。



东北是中国玉米的重要产区，在…</span>

                    <span>柯娜是一款小品级游戏，也是一款美丽的游戏，但游戏毕竟不是画，不能光好看。作为一款ARPG，它在游戏性的表现上，距离它的美术水平就差得太远了。
先附上大师难度的几个BOSS战，很可能你看着都很无聊。

目录

战斗深度不足

战斗变化不够
弱点位置很微妙
镜头与目标

剧情的薄弱
迷题，缺少巧妙感
无用的收集
不会再出现的怪物
结论

战斗深度不足
作为一款动作游戏，战斗自然是重点，关于此，柯娜可以说是 不及格 。随着时间的推移，战斗体验没有一点可以刺激玩家的因素增加。前期的战斗非常匮乏，而后期同样匮乏。
战斗缺少变化
柯娜虽然有技能树，但能够带来战斗变化的技能几乎没有，除了拉弓的子弹时间。几乎所有解锁的技能，要么是可用性低，要么是伤害不够。
大多数的精英怪或BOSS战都有弱点，攻击弱点后，它会硬直一长段时间，这时候肯定是输出打伤害的最佳时机，像任天堂的大多数游戏都遵循这个套路，甚至有些还只能靠这个时候才能制造伤害，但是柯娜在这个时候，两手空空，不管你用重攻击还是腐灵锤，伤害区别都不太大，很憋屈。
疾跑重攻击，完美蓄力攻击
其实，技能的伤害变化不大没有关系，既然被攻击到弱点硬直了，好歹增加点弱点伤害，也是可以接受的。有时候多死几次后，我就想寻找一下有没有什么技能可以提升这种情况下的伤害，但并没有。
很直白，从游戏开始到结束，全程基本上都是在刮沙。
弱点位置很微妙
首先需要区分一下“不容易”和“无法”这两个概念。不容易是说机会出现了，但不容易好抓住，而无法是出现的机会都极少或是没有。柯娜就是后者，很多的精英怪弱点在背上，但它会永远面对着你，不管你跑得多快，甚至开启子弹时间，都很难攻击到。设计上，要有，就得给我明确的机会，要么就不要给。我有时候为了打弱点，把自己人头送了，都没有打到，很有摔手柄的冲动。还有就是，这个弱点带来的收益很小，除了能够阻止一次敌人的行动，外加一点点额外的伤害，真的是一点点，没看出来有多大的区别。
镜头与目标
镜头的问题其实是可以通过设置关闭的，但这个默认开启的选项，就是一个错误。前面的最多是让你不够爽快，那这个问题，就是在让你抓狂，虽然出现在的情况不多，但出现的时候很可能就是很重要的时刻。
表现为：镜头有一个弱机制，就是会帮助朝向目标，但当需要转向寻找补血的花时，有时候镜头会自动的拉回目标，这很可能会让你失去补血的时间。同理，在多个目标存在的情况下，这问题也同样存在。
我一向对于逆反馈的设计很反感，不太明白这个设计的用意。
剧情的薄弱
要说战斗设计不太行，那好好的讲讲故事也可以，但并没有。一共3段，每段取得3个信物，然后就可以和被腐化的灵魂战斗，目的就是解放他们。听上去是不是很像任天堂的游戏，但是这三段并没有啥联系，讲道理，直接去杀最终BOSS也没什么必要前提条件。那这些都是在告诉我们什么呢？什么都没有，就连主角的情况也基本上没有说明，最后就是玩了个寂寞，啥也没明白。
迷题
说它有，它确实有，但也可以说没有，因为不够巧妙的迷题的意义与作用并不大，而且类型太过相同。给你制造了一些关卡，但却不需要你思考，甚至可以说连想都不会让你想一下，靠感觉就可以了。比如说按顺序点灯，提示都在很明显的位置，而且只是提示，没有任何逻辑。

无用的收集
可收集一共有3个：腐灵，冒子和那个什么（太不重要，名字都记不得）。除了腐灵可以增加使用次数，冒子和那个什么的目的是同一个，那就是给地上的腐灵戴冒子，光找到冒子还不行，还得用那个什么去买。到最后，我都没有把那个什么用出去。
这明显有充数的嫌疑。
不会再出现的怪物
场景里清掉的怪，就不会再出现，不管是否再次进入该区域，只能重新游戏。之所以我把它拧出来说，是因为有奖杯要求，如：“物归原主”。

如果你在路上错过了，那你只能开新周目再来了。
我当时还是为了做这个奖杯，在农田那边找到了目标怪物，但因为一个不小心，把它打死了，然后，本周目就无法完成了。
难道是为了帖合主题，腐化净化了，怪物消灭后就不再出现了？不可思议。这是游戏啊，同志们。
结论
本文的战斗部分，我是在普通通关，大师难度未开始这段时间写的。现在是我大师难度通关后，因此，我可能需要对战斗部分做一些补充，虽然它无法影响我对于战斗设计问题的大方向，但我仍然看到了另一个点，那就是它的战斗核心： 反应挑战 。 没有宏大的场景、炫酷的招式、华丽的必杀，有的只是见招拆招的反应。它并不一定好，但却是一个很重要的战斗本质 。
实话实说，BOSS战我打得很尽兴，那种必须要面对的招式，就得全神贯注，大师难度通关后，成就感满满。

                    <span>德章泰-莫里在12月10日对阵掘金的比赛里拿到20分8篮板9助攻，从而成为马刺队史最快完成3000分+1500篮板+1000助攻的球员。
这条纪录里的“最快”对于如今重建的马刺来说似乎隐含了特殊意义，一名职业运动员的生涯长度总是有限的，而“最快”意味“用时最短”，那么一名运动员能用更短的时间比其他人完成更多的工作，按照这个趋势那不就意味着他的整个职业生涯能比其他人创造更多的价值？也就说明他是更好的球员？
已经迈入重建期的马刺，需要未来的想象空间，但同时也需要在当下看到其中的确定性，前者固然重要，但后者是让人相信前者能实现的基础。
而25岁已经达到3000+1500+1000的莫里无疑是二者兼备的存在，莫里正在用赛场上的进化说服球迷们相信他是值得下注的那个人。



许多球评都把莫里列入了新晋全明星的选择，甚至最佳进步球员也应该有他的一席之地，在这份热烈的舆论氛围里，我们不妨来探讨莫里这赛季在哪些方面的实质性进化给他带来了好评？
我认为，针对这个问题一言以蔽之就是：莫里变成了更好的组织后卫。
如果展开来谈莫里做了什么让自己变成了“更好的组织后卫”，可以用北京时间12月7日马刺惜败太阳的比赛来作为观察的样本。
这场比赛马刺的3连胜被终结，而作为马刺战术核心的莫里则随着比赛进程经历了“从打击防守到被防守限制“的起伏，既能看到莫里进化后的姿态，也能看到莫里尚待打磨的不足。



本赛季，莫里完全接过了进攻组织的主动权，他过去三年场均触球数从56.4到69再到现在的88，展示了他从德罗赞小弟成长为马刺大哥的过程。
人称杨队的塞德斯-杨这样评价莫里：”他每个夜晚都在很好地运营球队”，这里的运营包括场外也包括场内，场外的事情我们局外人不便多说，场内的事情作为观众我们可以略窥一二。
面对总决赛球队的防线，莫里送出了赛季次高的14次助攻，这14次助攻则是他运营比赛的具体展现。而莫里本赛季助攻…</span>

                    <span>昨晚，我窝在沙发，看乒乓球世界杯男单决赛，樊振东对阵张本智和，看着看着，我的注意力忽然被张本智和的名字吸引：TOMOKAZU HARIMOTO

唾沫……卡组，哈里……摩托？我照着念了出来，与此同时，电视里的解说员仍在说：“张本智和这一板抢攻很果断，但是……”
我：？？？不是TOMOKAZU HARIMOTO吗？张本在哪？智和又在哪？


之前在别的比赛里也看过类似的情况，评论员说的名字，跟画面显示出来的英文名读音完全不一样。


这也太奇怪了吧？英文名字Micheal翻译成迈克或者迈克尔，好歹读音差不多啊。

而且很久以前，我就注意到，像“波多野结衣”，明明念作“哈他挪雨衣（Hatano yui）”，根本就没有“波多”，也没有“结衣”，那为啥大家叫她“波多老师”呢？波多在哪儿呢？为什么不叫哈老师呢？


带着这个疑问，我看完比赛就立刻去查了一下资料，发现背后的缘由还蛮有意思。


通俗解释一下：张本智和为什么是&quot;哈里摩托&quot;

很久很久以前，日本只有语言，没有文字，大家就是愣说，不写。
但有时候没有文字确实不太方便，于是人们开始试着造文字，但是实在太特么难了。

后来他们发现：这个世界上已经有了一种叫“汉字”的东西，用它的人都非常厉害，个个都是人才。日本的官修史书《日本书纪》记载着：公元258年，一个叫王仁的博士（真的是个博士），把汉籍传入日本（其中据说有《论语》）。
诶，既然汉字这么博大精深，那就直接拿汉字来用吧！
但是他们很快发现，汉字太坑了——同一个字，居然有好多种读音！
因为不同朝代的发音有区别，以及传过去的人是不同地方的，说话可能有地方口音，同一篇文章，让一个广东羊，和让一个胡建棱或者北京人儿来念，那肯定不一样的，所以日文里的汉字就出现很多种读法，汉音、吴音、唐音、古训、俗训等等。
但是大体上分成两派：
“音读”一派主张按照传入时的汉语发音，或者模仿相…</span>

                    <span>中国男篮大胜日本赛后，杜锋指导与教练组专程在大巴前等候，与球员一一击掌，还对张镇麟上演摸头杀，网友纷纷赞叹：“名帅气度”“成功不是偶然”“有仪式感很好”

这样的细节绝不是临时起意的花架子，4年前，杜指导执教中国男篮蓝队，在金砖运动会上不敌俄罗斯屈居亚军，赛后他就在更衣室与每一位球员击掌鼓励。可紧接着的亚洲杯，蓝队面对澳大利亚下半场崩盘，杜指导的赛后仪式便也在舆论中石沉大海，葬身批评指责之中了。
2018年男篮对抗赛对伊朗
从2012年退役开始做国家队助教，2013年成为广东主帅，杜指导的教练生涯比之球员时代坎坷复杂得多，即便是2017年他将广东重新带回了总决赛，但遭遇新疆横扫，加上国家队的失利，他的眼前都是一片黯淡。
彼时的他，彼时的大家都猜不到短短4年后，风评逆转。对一名教练来说，口碑逆转可能只需要他获得荣誉赢得胜利的那一个夜晚便足够，可那一场胜利的背后，需要的往往是教练、球员、球队持续多年的试炼和等待。
你们还记得，那些年“任性”的杜指导和广东的后卫荒吗？

我们选取的是2015年12月27日对阵青岛的比赛，为什么是这一场？15-16赛季，正好是京粤争霸结束，广东连续输给北京，杜指导声望最低之时。对青岛这一场，广东先赢后输被逆转，遭遇极为罕见的3连败，自从广东崛起以来这近20年，常规赛3连败似乎仅此一回，那时几乎是全网热议广东是否会换帅。
回到那场比赛，让我们来看看不被理解的杜指导的篮球哲学，和他所遭遇的理想与现实的极度反差。
广东的首发阵容：周湛东、周鹏、朱芳雨、埃克-迪奥古、易建联，由于威尔-拜纳姆带伤，杜指导决定打1小4大。
在成为主帅后，杜指导不止一次表达过自己提速的理念，“我希望加快球队进攻的速率，打灵活式的篮球，而不是摆桩子。勇士就是这种风格，这也是国际篮球的一个发展趋势。”

提速通常需要一些必备要素，比如经验丰富的后卫，攻击力出众的锋线，或者移动能力强…</span>

                    <span>中国人懂吃，举世闻名，外国人不服不行。
具体有多出名呢？联合国教科文组织曾在全球范围内，认证了一批“世界美食之都”。截至2021年11月，全球共有19个闪闪发亮的美食之都，中国就占了其中5个：成都、顺德、澳门、扬州，以及前不久刚刚“进群”的淮安。



淮安，位于江苏省北部，古称“山阳”或“淮阴”，地处淮河与京杭大运河的交汇点，自古以来便是水运枢纽、南北要冲，素有“运河之都、九省通衢”之称。





这里，也正好位于中国南北地理分界线上。从古至今，这里车水马龙，天南地北的人与食材，在此交流碰撞，最终孕育出了这座美食之城，以及声名远扬的八大菜系之一——淮扬菜。





这座“不南不北”的城市，人文荟萃，名家辈出。西汉大将韩信，在此受漂母舍饭，终成汉初三杰；晚明奇才吴承恩，在此闭关求索，终成旷世奇书《西游记》；开国总理周恩来，以此为生命起点，终成新中国奠基人之一，更秉持着对家乡滋味的念怀，促成“开国第一宴”。
淮安，究竟有什么魔力，能以厚重历史和精妙美味征服世界，连联合国都流了口水？


淮扬菜，南北吃货大战的终结者
也许你对淮安不熟，但你一定吃过淮扬菜。



在中国八大菜系之中，淮扬菜非常特别：不以所在省份命名。这让不少人以为，淮扬菜就是淮安、扬州一带的风味菜——如此认知，是时候刷新一下了。





淮扬菜的“淮”字，指的是以淮安为代表的淮河中下游流域；“扬”字，则指代以扬州为代表的扬子江（长江）流域。广义的淮扬菜系，包括整个长江中下游、淮河及连接两者的京杭大运河流域，是一片很广阔的地域。



这块土地，除了物产丰隆、人文繁盛，更拥有水网密布、四通八达的地理优势。淮河东西奔流，大运河沟通南北，恰好在此相会；它们邂逅之处，便是今天的淮安。南来北往的食客与食材在此碰撞，撞出了中国最会吃的一群人，以及考究的淮扬美味。



若论淮扬菜的江湖地位，开国第一宴由它唱主角，这名…</span>

Lyrics:
God is Great

Outlawz

[Hook]
You hold the gun I take the wheel
If you say go you know I will
And though this love has its flaw
We’re forever outlaws
You Messed around but I forgave ya
Why do they still want me to hate ya
Cause if im choosing to forget it
Why cant they just mind they business
Cause I’m stuck, stuck like glue
Cause I can’t I can’t I can’t stop lovin you

I wanna see my dawgs on the mountain tops
Them niggas only ballin when they album drop
I gotta line of cars wrap around the block
And …</span>

                    <span>The world’s favorite blue hedgehog is back for a next-level adventure in SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2. After settling in Green Hills, Sonic is eager to prove he has what it takes to be a true hero. His test comes when Dr. Robotnik returns, this time with a new partner, Knuckles, in search for an emerald that has the power to destroy civilizations. Sonic teams up with his own sidekick, Tails, and together they embark on a globe-trotting journey to find the emerald before it falls into the wrong hands. From the filmmakers behind The Fast and the Furious and Deadpool, SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2 stars James Marsden, Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, and Jim Carrey returning, alongside new additions Shemar Moore, with Idris Elba as the voice of Knuckles, and Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey as the voice of Tails.

Letra: 

¿Qué me hizo usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar…

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido, oh - oh

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres …</span>

                    <span>Everything we do is online. We bank online, access healthcare, pay our taxes, build our businesses -  and along the way we put trust in companies to keep us protected.
Unfortunately, companies aren’t great at writing secure software. Contrast Security wants to change that.
Jeff Williams, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Contrast Security, and Steve Wilson, CPO, join the Dev Interrupted podcast to discuss the future of application security (AppSec), the importance of security automation and why the traditional way of doing security - where you scan app after app a few times a year - is over.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



By the numbers: the average application is attacked 13,000 times a month

And has over 35 vulnerabilities

The reasons AppSec should to be automated
How to reduce the cost of AppSec
Why shifting left doesn&#x27;t result in more secure code

Many systems require sending emails to notify users. And testing these notifications manually is a pain. So it&#x27;s one of the best use cases for integration testing. First, let&#x27;s create strongly typed model for our Welcome email:
public class Welcome
{
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}

And we create a Razor template for the email in EmailTemplates/Welcome.cshtml:
@model EmailSnapshotTesting.EmailTemplates.Welcome
@{
    Layout &#x3D; &quot;~/EmailTemplates/_Layout.cshtml&quot;;
}

Welcome @Model.FullName
Welcome to our wonderful service!

And this is how the layout is going to look like in EmaiTemplates/_Layout.cshtml:

                    <span>I&#x27;m planning to start a series of posts showing my first impressions as someone inexperienced in programming who had his first impressions in Python. I&#x27;ll try to post every time I finish studying so that the original feeling is still clear.
While messing around on Discord, I found a discussion about this language and how it was useful in web development. It wasn&#x27;t very long and not all that interesting, but they said something that really caught my attention. 

I really like python and my focus is on web development, so why not try it out?
This thought was what made me start looking for online resources, a task that apparently I&#x27;m not intelligent enough to do, so I asked on Discord.
PHP is a scripting language specialized in web development and that can be embedded inside HTML and is executed on the server, meaning no shady scripts running on the client computer and more freedom working with sensitive data.

PHP can be manually installed by itself, or so I was told, but the easiest way when learning is through those already configured packages, like WAMP, LAMP and XAMPP. People from discord recommended using XAMPP, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with it for now. Having installed it, everything left is understanding how it works.</span>

                    <span>Set up Neovim for Full Stack Development


You&#x27;ll need:
Coc 
emmet
install neovim


Install vim-plug (or any other plugin manager)
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug


I recommend checking out my dotfiles which has lots of comments so you can find any extra features that might be helpful for you.



I will write another post for a more in-depth description of getting started with neovim...
To install Coc, you&#x27;ll want to follow their instructions at the link below. It is 
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
With neovim open, type the following:
:CocConfig coc-html coc-tsserver coc-json coc-emmet  coc-prettier
Coc tsserver is for javascript, typescript, and JSX support
You&#x27;ll want to create a shortcut for :call CocAction(&#x27;format&#x27;). I have the following shortcut so that I can format my projects with space + f:
nnoremap f :call CocAction(&#x27;format&#x27;)
head over to the Node.js downloads page and follow their installation instructions. You can also use your package manager to install Node. 
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo pacman -S nodejs
I highly recommend installing tmux so you can run your frontend, backend, neovim, and git cli in the same terminal window which makes it way easier to keep your workspace clear. Tmux is great because you can name your sessions and easily navigate to the right spot for what you&#x27;re looking to do.</span>

                    <span>I planned how to contribute to an open source project last week and wrote about it in my previous blog. In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!
For the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I&#x27;ve decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college&#x27;s C language course notes. The issue I&#x27;m working on is about &quot;Standardize frontmatter across all pages&quot;. When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.
I&#x27;ve done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:
Added id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages
Each property of frontmatter was unified in order
Unified format of description
Shortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the  inside the 
tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)
Added &quot;Standardize frontmatter&quot; to the CONTRIBUTING.md file
PR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143




  
  
  Getting reviews and change requests


One of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo&#x27;s owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I&#x27;m familiar with the course notes, but I wasn&#x27;t very good at C language.
The goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn&#x27;t change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.</span>

                    <span>TLDR


Responsible AI uses AI to empower individuals and put people’s values first. Its ethical deployment is essential to fight against algorithmic bias.
Intro
What is Responsible AI?
Steps for Responsible AI
Responsible AI in practice
The rapid development of AI will have a big impact on nearly every aspect of private and professional life. The determination of that impact’s success should be judged by how ethically and responsibly the technology is created. With laws not being able to keep up with the pace that AI is being developed, it falls on companies and developers to make a responsible product.

The power of AI is in its ability to be deployed quickly across the world; however, this could also be AI’s greatest threat, as algorithms can spread bias on a massive scal…</span>

                    <span>We&#x27;re going to go over three of the logical operators that Javascript uses:



The benefit of a logical operator is to connect two (or more!) expressions so that the value of the total (all of the expressions you just connected) is dependent on those expressions. 
These operators are used within code to compare variables and values when creating various logic methods, often using their boolean values. When used within functions it gives more logic options for the code to use and change based on user behavior. This can also help DRY up code in condensing functions.
The NOT ! operator is generally used as a boolean. Logical NOT will have truthy value if the operator it&#x27;s called on (like !(6 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) is false and vice-versa (like !(6 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 6) is considered a false value. Here&#x27;s a different way of…</span>

                    <span>Managing Dependencies with go.mod


A project&#x27;s dependencies are declared in the go.mod file. This is where the modules are stored when you do go get . You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. 
When you clone a Go project from github, for example, you&#x27;ll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you&#x27;re coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. 
You may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn&#x27;t have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project&#x27;s go.mod file. 
For example:
github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn&#x27;t have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc. You would then have github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc // indirect in your project&#x27;s go.mod file. 
note: the above is a hypothetical scenario, you won&#x27;t actually have any indirect dependencies with github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2
go.sum includes the checksum for the dependencies to make sure that you&#x27;re installing the exact same dependency as the author used. 
To create a new Go project where you can have a go.mod file, you need to set it up on your GOPATH with a name for your project. 
Running go mod init 
You need to run go mod init before you&#x27;re able to get dependencies for your project with go get</span>

                    <span>Hey there, my name is Tiago and I am the host of Wannabe Entrepreneur (a podcast about what it&#x27;s like to bootstrap a company).  
The great thing about having a podcast is that I have an &quot;excuse&quot; to ask questions to people I admire and want to learn from!
Recently I got to interview Cassidy Williams (@cassidoo
) and she has more than 170K followers on Twitter!! I won&#x27;t lie, I was quite nervous... But she was super nice and the interview went really well.
Here are the top 3 things I learned from Cassidy:
1- Be humble and genuine
2- Some companies want access to your social media
she keeps all the control over her social media. With more than 170K followers I guess that many companies could use it for personal marketing...
3- Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment
that rule is BS! Cassity was never afraid to leave a job where she was not happy and that gave her the opportunity to experiment with different types of companies and find which ones she prefers to work at.
These are just 3 of a lot of lessons I took from my casual chat with Cassidy Williams. Would love to hear your thoughts on the interview. What questions did I miss? You can listen to the full chat here</span>

Conductor is a Microservices orchestration platform from Netflix, released under Apache 2.0 Open Source License.
jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.
Conductor allows you to create tasks that can process JSON payloads in your workflows without writing custom code using jq.  
JSON is a popular format of choice for data-interchange. It is widely used in web and server applications, document storage, API I/O etc. It’s also used within Conductor to define workflow and task definitions and passing data and state between tasks and workflows. This makes a tool like JQ a natural fit for processing task rel…</span>

.NET provides a Syntax API that can read any C# or Visual Basic source file and provide the corresponding Syntax Tree for that code.
Why would someone need to traverse the C# syntax tree?
Well, it can be for a number of reasons, maybe you want to gather statistics about how many classes, namespaces and methods you have, maybe you want generate code based on what is already written, maybe you want to create new tools like a new linter or a tool like Swagger. All these things can be done by analyzing the syntax tree.

                    <span>Markdown (MD) 是现在最流行的文档书写语言格式，用户只需一些非常「简单易记」的语法就能写出一篇具有良好排版和可读性的文章，因此大受欢迎，渐渐已成为互联网写作的新潮流。
而 Markdown 写作语法非常简单易上手，譬如两个星号包围文字可实现**加粗效果**，_斜体_，三个减号- - -输出一条分割线等。在写作时打字跟排版能一气呵成，配合 Typora、MWeb 等高效的写作软件，熟练后行云流水的输入绝对让你有抛弃 Word 之类“重量级”软件的冲动……

一、主要功能介绍
复制摘录：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发，复制摘录文字或图片，支持多选后批量触发，支持文档模式下点击摘录使用，双击改为复制标题，配合快贴使用可以检测到多个复制信息（包括文本和图片）
欧陆词典：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发，或选中文字后点击按钮触发，自动调用欧路词典查询单词或翻译句子
标题摘录转化：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发，支持多选，也支持文档模式下点击摘录后触发
MD Link：
点击卡片后点击按钮触发￼￼，自动复制为markdown链接格式，文字为卡片标题，链接为该卡片url，无标题则显示为notitle，支持多选后复制，也支持文档模式下点击摘录后触发，双击复制为纯URL
二、 迷你模式
该插件支持在标准与迷你模式间切换，迷你模式下仅显示为一列图标，点击图标后触发的功能与标准模式下一致


IMG_09012732×2048 611 KB


三、其它设置
垂直位置调整：
可将插件面板上下移动以满足需求
位置切换：
点击后会在三种位置上切换（屏幕左侧，文档与脑图分界线，屏幕右侧）
位置跟随：
启动该模式后，会根据手指位置自动选择合适的高度和屏幕位置，以达到方便点击的目的（ps：mn的文档定位有bug，所以这功能并不是很好用）
是否贴边：
关闭贴边则会与屏幕边缘留下一点距离，以免挡住mn插件面板或手写工具栏
四、技术说明
插件基于CopySearch和ohmymn开发，并集成了SwitchTitle、SearchInEudic等功能，主要在其基础上增加了一些功能，比如复制为Markdown格式的链接，选中文字后即可点击调用欧路词典来查词和翻译，复制摘录功能可主动识别并复制摘录图片或摘录文本。理念是在尽量不遮挡屏幕的情况下（迷你模式）通过点击触发每个动作而不是自动触发（这样容易误触发）。
五、更新日志
version：1.1.0
OneClick_1.1.0.mnaddon (20.4 KB)
更新“复制摘录”功能的批量触发，更新双击“复制摘录”按钮会额外复制卡片标题的功能
更新双击“MD Link”按钮会复制纯链接的功能
切换文档后页面不会关闭

                    <span>Hi！MarginNote 团队又与大家见面啦！
今天是世界备份日（World Back Up Day），在这个由 Reddit 发起的，愚人节前一天的，口号为“别做愚人，备份你的数据“的节日里，我们将和大家分享你可以如何利用 5 道防线，保护你 MarginNote 中的数据安全，避免成为一个愚人～
请耐心看到最后，文末有福利哦。
一，历史存档——自动化的抵御大部分常规风险
便捷性：
安全性：
历史存档是 MarginNote 中内置的一个“时光照相机”，你可以利用它来保存某一时刻某笔记本的状态。如出现了误操作，你可以通过历史存档，打开之前的笔记。必要之时，还可以双开MarginNote，进行文档的对比。
它操作简单，同时也节省存储空间。通过历史存档给一个 300 MB 的脑图笔记本“拍照”，只会占用 8 MB 左右的空间。是不是很厉害？
不过，历史存档也有无能为力的地方。存档的数据仅被会被保存在本地，因而它只能应对本设备出现的误操作、同步冲突等问题。如果设备丢失或者损坏，那么你将无法恢复重要的笔记数据了:-(

二，高频笔记本独立备份——最常用且最可靠的保护之道
便捷性：
安全性：
在 iCloud 云同步和历史存档之外，在每完成一个阶段的记录后，你还可以考虑把重要的笔记本单独导出，进行备份。这种方式非常安全，而且十分灵活。这样，就算出现了系统 bug 或者是误操作，你重要的数据也不会受到影响。
你可以在很多的地方存储笔记本备份：你可以选择上传至百度网盘、通过 QQ 分享给好友、或者是存储到本地文件之中。每多存储一个地方，你的数据也就多了一层保险。

三，iCloud 云同步——刀尖上的舞者
便捷性：
安全性：
严格来讲，iCloud 云同步并不是一种增加数据安全的方法。由于笔记本数据可以在多地访问，不小心就有可能造成数据冲突，甚至造成笔记丢失。但是，它最大的缺点也是它的最大的优点：笔记会被同步到云端，因而就算一个设备彻底丢失，你也可以在其他设备上找到你珍贵的笔记。
在利用了可靠的云端存储之外，iCloud 云同步相比于其他的备份方式，在使用起来也十分方便。只需在 MarginNote 中打开 iCloud 云同步，你就可以轻松享受数据多设备同步等诸多好处。但值得注意的是，如果你正在进行非常重要的考试，关闭iCloud将是更稳妥的选择。
自动历史存档就是为iCloud同步的潜在问题而生的，历史存档会在检测到大量笔记变化时自动进行。

四，全局备份——需要数据线拷贝却最令人安心的庞然大物
便捷性：
安全性：
如果你想要一次性备份所有的文档与笔记，你可以选择全局备份。这听起来很费事，但实际上只需要几秒钟，MarginNote 就能轻松导出全局所有文档与笔记的备份。之后，你便可以把文件压缩并上传至百度网盘，或者存储在你认为安全的地方。


2021-03-31 20.23.161600×1200 5.32 MB


五，iCloud云备份——最后的救命稻草
便捷性：
安全性：
iCloud 云备份是通过苹果的 iCloud 备份对 MarginNote 的完整数据库和文档的备份。你可以在 iOS 或者 iPadOS 的系统设置中进行设置。在 iCloud 设置中，打开备份之后，在管理 iCloud 存储空间界面里，点按备份，并选择当前设备。在这里面，你可以打开 MarginNote 对应的开关。开启后，你的 iPad 会在接通电源并且有互联网连接时，自动把数据备份到 iCloud 之中。
这种方式操作复杂，同时恢复也很麻烦。但是，它非常的安全，能够帮助你在设备丢失、MarginNote 数据库崩溃的情况下，找回自己珍贵的笔记。

                    <span>从十月份开始，下半年购物季就拉开了帷幕。作为一个购物季扎堆的半年，不知道你有没有注意到这样的一个现象：我们彼此之间互相交流买买买、一起吐槽各路平台与商家套路的时候总是穿杂着一个话题—— 「XX 肯定在偷听我们说话，它广告推送的就是我们那天讨论的」。实际上，这是一个老生常谈的话题。抛开双十一这个特定的时间点，即便是在其他时候我们也能够听到类似的吐槽。
一说到「偷听」，人们马上就会想到隔墙有耳，两只耳朵竖起来的状态。过往的那些不美好的人生经验就会随之浮现并不断提醒自己提高警惕性。这种源自内心深处的不安让我们感到害怕。在马斯洛的需求层次理论当中，安全的需要是仅次于生理的。所以我们很自然地就会给予高度的关注。
荣格与共时性，图片来自维基百科
1920 年代，瑞士心理学家荣格提出了「共时性」的概念。荣格认为：

这些表面上无因果关系的事件之间有着非因果性、有意义的联系，这些联系通常取决于人的主观经验。人总是对巧合印象深刻。

不过，有时候仔细的考量一下，似乎广告推送的也并不总是那么准。这种「偷听」会不会又是一种巧合呢？就是说，App 推送的内容与我们工作与生活中遇到的一些事情恰巧重叠在一起，我们根据自身的人生经验将他们联系到了一起。我们所在意地精准推送又会不会像荣格的共时性中讲的那样？
那么，这些被吐槽的平台到底是否在偷听我们说话？或者更进一步讲，它们是否通过偷听我们说话，进而进行分析并精准广告推送呢？
通过手机「偷听」说话，进行精准推送的可能性有多大？
就单纯的技术而言，手机偷听其实并不是一件很难的事情，但同时，它也并不是一件很容易的事情。究竟通过「偷听」来进行精准的广告推送的可能性有多大，我们逐一往下看。
一般来讲手机悄悄地进行录音通常包括两种情况：一种是（用户授权后的）后台静默监听，一种是突破系统权限进行监听。
对于前者，App 通过静默在后台进行偷听的技术难度大，手机自带的操…</span>

🎁 十二月 Pixel Feature Drop

作为 Pixel 用户，除了 Google 第一方待遇的系统更新支持，另一个众所周知的好处就是你的手机还能随着每个季度发布的 Pixel Feature Drop 收到更多新功能，即便是较早发布的设备往往也不例外。
本周，十二月份的 Pixel Feature Drop 正式开始面向现有 Pixel 手机推送，加入了一系列新功能，也包括对现有 Bug 的修复。
除了 Google 与宝马合作为 Pixel 6 系列新增的车钥匙功能之外，Pixel 6 Pro 还在本次更新之后启用了 UWB 超宽频功能，但目前只能用于提升 Nearby Share 就近分享功能的识别速度。
另一个本次新增功能是用于帮助听障困难者在嘈杂环境下对话的应用 Sound Amplifier：它可以使用手机的机器学习算法来自动过滤掉除对话内容之外的环境噪声：只需要在对话前将手机摄像头对准你与之交谈的对象并选取，放下手机之后便可以在嘈杂环境下正常对话，尽可能地降低外部噪音给听障用户带来的沟通困难。

基于离线模型识别附近播放歌曲的「Now Playing」功能也得到增强：Pixel 4 系列用户现在也可以将本地模型无法正确识别的歌曲手动上传至云端数据库来识别；同时也可以直接将识别出的歌曲标记为喜欢方便后续整理。

                    <span>就像我之前一直说的，即便是电动车，也一样拥有驾驶乐趣，特别是在优秀的调校加持下，更是如此。
作为一个小马力前驱车驾驶员，能得出这样的结论，跟我前不久驾（bai）驶（嫖）的一台车有很大关系，那就是小鹏的P7高性能版，那期节目相信很多人都还有印象。

1.底盘结构影响操控感
其实，要搞懂这个问题，我们最先该聊的，根本就不是动力形式，而最重要的东西，是底盘设计。
什么样的底盘才是“键盘值最高”或者说比较理想的结构呢？这个问题可能问100个人会有100种答案，但是放心，其中出镜率最高的，绝对是两种，双叉臂和多连杆。考虑到造车理念，成本还有布置空间等一系列的问题，现在市面上能见到的，“最具键盘值”的底盘结构非前双叉臂后多连杆莫属了。

保时捷确实前桥使用的麦弗逊，但是人家的调校功力和开发预算并非常规厂家能比的，因此它的厉害并不影响我们以上的结论。

这个结构市场上确实不算是很多见，但是其实有这么几款电动车都用了这个结构，像特斯拉Model 3、小鹏P7、蔚来ET7等这些车型。



而且在使用这个结构的同时，基本上都顺手把能用铝合金的部件都用上了铝合金。这其实跟这些“新势力”厂商开发新车基本上都没有上代车型有很大关系，我要是造车从零开始的话，我肯定也会选择用一个至少从理论上要表现更好的结构啊。


2.调校也很重要
结构不错是个基础，但是接下来的调校也是一关考验，就好像一个钢琴，再是好牌子，调音师是个业余的门外汉，出来的产品也并不会非常优秀的。都说保时捷造车造的好，开着感受好，其实，里面不光是投资，更是有着一个优秀且专业的团队在背后默默付出。什么？你说养不起这么大的团队？那好办，保时捷旗下的保时捷工程公司能够随时成为你的供应商，帮你调车。

没错，保时捷旗下有这么一家名为保时捷工程的公司，这家公司的技术团队有保时捷工程是的实力，这个团队不造车，但是会参与到有需求的厂家的造车过程中，也…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计师Calvin。大约2010年，我有幸涉足了DNF、QQ炫舞、疾风之刃、QQ飞车等产品的影视宣传，随即便入了游戏行业的坑，直奔琳琅天上工作室（也就是现在的天美），开启了我十年的游戏美术设计生涯。
作为老飞车玩家，秉持着对飞车的喜爱，这十年来，我一直从事QQ飞车的制作。从起初的端游场景赛道设计，到现在端/手游双端场景设计、IP包装、CG........每一个环节都留下了我努力搬砖的身影。
工作之余，我喜欢画画、模玩、游戏，也喜欢旅游，因此看到这个话题，我想我可以简单地向大家分享一下我的观点。
先说结论，我认为游戏是有潜力带动旅游业的，尤其是在疫情隔离的影响之后，如何鼓励人们从宅在家，到有意愿出去散心走走，一个好的办法，就是让大家在游戏中去看见，甚至体验旅游景地的美好风景与人文温度。
身为休闲赛车游戏《QQ飞车手游》的美术负责人，近几年我们一直在尝试将游戏与现实中的景点结合，比如今年我们与四川省旅游宣传促进中心合作，在游戏里推出了“梦回古蜀”与“云游天府”两条全新赛道，去一站式、沉浸式地呈现现实中的三星堆博物馆与四川的人文风貌。

“梦回古蜀”赛道展示的“古”，是四川的历史沉淀。玩家驾车驶入庞大的三星堆博物馆，在曲折幽暗的地宫回廊中穿梭，一路经过巨大的青铜立人像与太阳神鸟，去丈量和感受那神秘厚重的古蜀文明，体验一种冒险感。




与之相比，“云游天府”赛道则展现的是“今”，是四川的现代生活。在乐山大佛的脚下，坐卧着岁月静好的山城，有川剧变脸、蜀绣隽美、熊猫嬉闹，也有火锅串串的飘香、麻将的热闹、宽窄巷子的风情，体验一种安逸巴适，人间烟火的生活氛围。




在社交平台和部分随机问卷调查中，有不少玩家称赞了四川主题赛道的设计，并希望我们推出更多地域文化与传统文化的联名赛道，并为自己的家乡打call。这确实让我们感到十分欢喜，也认定“游戏”与“文化旅游…</span>

谢邀， 其实之前就想写写《街球江湖》的事，但每次提笔便放下，这真是个很难回答到问题：有太多想说的，关于创作本身，关于对行业的看法，关于一直以来我们团队所奉行的模式理念这些，但每次都是千头万绪无法找到开头的感觉。
直到上上周看到这个问题，忽然脑海中就崩出来上面那段总结，花了两周时间顺着上面这个思路重新捋了一下自己对《街球江湖》的看法



                               part1: 《街球江湖》是一部在慢慢变好看的漫画
创作背景
每次提到《街球江湖》创作，它的诞生背景总是个无法绕开的话题 —— 街球连载以来在读者中得到了很多好评，但客观来讲，从专业角度看，这部作品还存在很多不足。尽管如此，我也无论如何也想让大家知道，在它诞生但背后有一个为之倾注来了极大热情与专注，无论怎样都想让它变得更好的团队在不断滴努力。
街球项目起始于17年夏天，彼时我正经历第一次漫画创业的低谷，寄予厚望的《超级绿》因为资方战略调整而无奈终止，和助理们搬进朋友公司的二楼小隔间里，一边安抚大家一边寻找新项目。 
一个朋友发来一个漫画项目的委托问我有没有兴趣：一家影视公司想做篮球ip，提供剧本，找团队做成漫画。

                    <span>Every legacy. Every rivalry. Leads to this. Cobra Kai S4 premieres globally Dec 31, only on Netflix. 

COBRA KAI takes place over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). Season 4 finds the Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang dojos joining forces to take down Cobra Kai at the All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament... and whoever loses must hang up their gi. As Samantha and Miguel try to maintain the dojo alliance and Robby goes all in at Cobra Kai, the fate of the Valley has never been more precarious. What tricks does Kreese have up his sleeve? Can Daniel and Johnny bury their decades-long hatchet to defeat Kreese? Or will Cobra Kai become the face of karate in the valley?

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape &#x27;Life B4 Fame&#x27; with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.</span>

                    <span>This month, return to the sands of Tatooine. The Book of Boba Fett, an all-new Original series, starts streaming December 29 on @DisneyPlus.

“The Book of Boba Fett,” a thrilling Star Wars adventure teased in a surprise end-credit sequence following the Season 2 finale of “The Mandalorian,” finds legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett and mercenary Fennec Shand navigating the galaxy’s underworld when they return to the sands of Tatooine to stake their claim on the territory once ruled by Jabba the Hutt and his crime syndicate.

 

“The Book of Boba Fett” stars Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen. Jon Favreau, Dave Filoni, Robert Rodriguez, Kathleen Kennedy and Colin Wilson are the executive producers. Karen Gilchrist and Carrie Beck serve as co-executive producers, with John Bartnicki producing and John Hampian as co-producer.

                    <span>The protocol that powers the web is known as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A connection can exist between the two programs to send and receive data. 
A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers. Networks have to follow these rules to successfully transmit data.
Python provides a library called sockets to make connections and communicate data between connections.

Sometimes I find my models cluttered with a lot of things: relationships, attributes casting, scopes, custom methods, etc. 
When this happens, one thing I like to do is move my scopes in a dedicated builder. This post will show you how I do that. 
We are working with bunnies because cats are all over the place already and because of the pressure I get from Coton the Tige. 🐰

Let&#x27;s spin up our artisan command to create the model with the migration flag (-m) and the factory flag (-f):
php artisan make:model Bunny -mf

Now let&#x27;s define the data structure of our fleecy table (gist):
Schema::create(&#x27;bunnies&#x27;, function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;id();
    $table-&gt;string(&#x27;n…</span>

                    <span>Dashboards are great for visualization and keeping track of what&#x27;s going on. Managing a repository for a team can be cumbersome and keeping a track of all the pull requests even so. One potential solution could be the dashboard, dashboards are great for visualization and keeping track of what&#x27;s going on. 
In this article, we will discuss how to create a Github Pull Requests Dashboard using ReactJS and Material UI.
Setting up React
Let&#x27;s begin by creating a boilerplate using the create-react-app
npx create-react-app github-pr-dashboard

Install Material UI
We will be using Material UI as a UI library. It boosts up the speed of development as we won&#x27;t have to manually write CSS.
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

                    <span>Somewhere buried in my dusty basement lives a signed copy of Dan Cederholm&#x27;s classic book Bulletproof Web Design. I purchased it during my first trip to An Event Apart in 2007. This book meant a lot to me back then, and almost 15 years later, many of its concepts still hold true.
The premise of the book is that designs should be &quot;bulletproof&quot; to accommodate the many ways they can be used.
I&#x27;m using the term bulletproof partly to describe flexibility—in other words, designs for the web that can easily accommodate various text sizes and amounts of content, designs that expand or contract along with whatever is placed within them.
I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for many years. More recently, my focus has been on building design systems. Although a lot has changed on the World Wide Web over the…</span>

                    <span>Doka is a Russian web developer&#x27;s newest open-source handbook. We are new, so we had to create our workflow from scratch. We are demanding labels users, and we can hook you up too!
When a project has a sophisticated multi-stage review process, the workflow quickly goes out of hand - pull requests get lost, and the review time grows, leading to unhappy contributors.
For example, In Doka&#x27;s case, we have four sections of our website, each with a dedicated editor: HMTL, CSS, JS, and tools. On top of that, there is a responsible for demos, an illustrator, and a publishing editor. We wanted to have one place where they can go to understand what job is pending.

                    <span>Introduction


If you run Node in production, sooner or later you&#x27;ll come across a common bug known as a memory leak.
This was the case with my current side project, expose. I wrote a popular article Six Ways To Drastically Boost Your Productivity As A Node Developer which mentioned it, then suddenly the server was overloaded.
During the period of high load, I could see that a memory leak was forming.
expose?


expose is a command line app that makes its simple to give a public URL to any web based app you have running locally on your machine. So if you have a local API runnig at http://localhost:8000 and you then run expose 8000, it will generate a public URL that you can then share.
It works by creating a websocket connection between the client and the expose service, which listens with …</span>

Summary: Make your toy web apps more robust and manageable by following the Twelve-Factor App methodology.
This is the second part in a series of posts detailing the 12 Factor App. In the last post we looked at:
Your codebase and made it deployable across different environments
Dependencies and why they’re important in reproducibility
Configuration files and how to make them useful across different environments
Backing services, what they are and how decoupling gives your app more flexibility
If you need a refresher or aren’t familiar with the above already, take a look at the last post. Many of the earlier concepts are used as building blocks for the concepts in this post.

I believe I am not the only who has read tens of express guides and never really found the perfect way of implementing it.
In fact, I am confident to say that every Node.js developer has read at least 5 to 6 different guides on writing Express applications. How to make it work is not really a problem nowadays. However, have you ever asked yourself what is the right way to do it? 
With that in mind, I decided to create a boilerplate that would summarize all the best practices used nowadays in the software industry, ensuring reliability, maintainability and scalability. This is what Bulletproof Express tries to accomplish. These are the features currently provided:

Acra allows configuring data masking to certain database fields. Data fields stay encrypted in the database, but look masked/anonymized when reading through Acra.
💡 Data masking is useful whether anonymizing datasets for reporting or exchanging the data with untrusted third parties. Acra supports full or partial data masking, allowing customization of mask format.

So, with data masking, data stays encrypted, but could be easily shared with untrusted parties without revealing it.

Why pay a translator or purchase an expensive translation app when you can build an effective multilingual translator with python in 5 minutes?
Going furthermore, we’ll make this translator even more fun by adding a text to speech capability to it. This will also make it easy for one to use this translator to learn a new language. Sounds interesting right?
Talk is cheap..I know right? Well then let’s get down to the business of the day. To build this amazing translator with python, we’ll be needing a few python modules:

欢迎来到 Flutter 2.8！该版本包含了 207 位 contributors 和 178 位 reviewers 的内容，其中一共有 2,424 个合并的 PR，并 Closed 了 2976 个问题。
与往常一样，Flutter 的工作的第一位就是保证质量，我们花费了大量时间来确保 Flutter 在支持的设备范围内可以尽可能平稳和稳健地运行。
Startup
该版本改进了应用的启动延迟问题，这个改进在 Google Pay 中进行了， Google Pay 作为一个主流的大型应用程序，代码超过 100 万行，使用它进行测试可以确保这些更改所产生的影响是可以被感知的。
所有这些改进使得 Google Pay 在低端 Android 设备上运行时的启动延迟降低了 50%，在高端设备上降低了 10%。
Flutter 通过影响 Dart VM 的垃圾收集策略的方式，可以有助于避免在应用启动期间出现不合时宜的 GC 。
例如在 Android 上渲染第一帧之前，Flutter 现在 只通知 Dart VM TRIM_LEVEL_RUNNING_CRITICAL 及以上的内存压力信号，在本地测试中，这个更改将低端设备上的第一帧时间减少了多达 300 毫秒。
出于严谨的考虑，在之前的版本中 Flutter 创建平台视图时会阻塞平台线程，这次通过详细的推理和测试 确定了可以删除一些序列化，这个改进消除了在低端设备上启动 Google Pay 期间超过 100 毫秒的阻塞。
另外，以前设置默认字体管理器时，会在设置第一个 Dart isolate 时添加人为的延迟，而延迟默认字体管理器 和 Dart Iso…</span>

                    <span>2021-2022 的秋季校招又拉开了帷幕。在今年的秋招中，我依然作为业务条线代表参与了全职和暑假实习生的简历筛选、面试和终选的全过程。这几年来，我都会在四季度集中经手两百余份简历。作为一个面试官，我每年都会为不少面试者扼腕叹息：从简历上我可以看得出申请人资质非常不错，但是他/她却不经意间犯了一个或多个「小错误」，导致最后我不得不忍痛割爱。而且，这些错误往往不会在常见的简历教程中提到。
在展开下文之前，我还是想强调一下：简历是非常个性化的产物，因人而异，因公司、岗位、行业而异，切不可一概而论。本文旨在从一家金融机构面试官的角度讨论类似行业的简历「避坑指南」，仅供参考。
你的简历在第一关会经历什么
申请者在网站上提交申请资料之后，人力资源部（HR） 会在网申临近结束或结束以后将资料全部导出，并进行第一步筛选。第一步筛选一般由电脑自动完成，主要确保申请者符合岗位的基本要求（如毕业年度、学历、材料是否齐全等）。如果有在线测试（如 SHL）的话，HR 也会设置一条分数线进行初步筛选。但从多年的经验来看，在线测试的分数线更像是一条及格线（比如 60 分），并不会过于苛刻。
在初步筛选之后，所有的网申材料都会打包提交给业务部门进行第二轮的筛选。这第二轮的筛选就是由业务经理进行的人工筛选了。一般我们会以简历为主，结合网申材料、开放式问题、在线测试成绩和近两年新增的视频回答进行一轮筛选，并给申请人分为三类：Yes、No、Maybe。在每一位的申请材料都审阅完毕后，我们会先考虑各个面试官手中标明 Yes 的应聘者，然后综合讨论所有的待定应聘者，填补剩余的面试席位。
在之后每一轮的面试、活动当中，之前所有的材料（包括网申、简历、以及每一轮评审的评论）都会一起交给下一轮的面试官。在这当中，简历又是每一轮面试官在见到本人之前，最直接了解应聘者的机会。因此，简历的重要性不言而喻。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70331">

                    <span>众所周知，去年的 macOS Big Sur 再一次更新了视觉设计风格，其中一项改动就是「焕然一新」的工具栏。至于焕然一新在哪……最明显的地方就是更大的额头。

这样的设计好不好看见仁见智，但有一点是肯定的：这么多的空间如果浪费就太可惜了。 以文件管理器 Finder 为例，尽管系统已经提供了一系列功能图标来充实工具栏，但仍不一定能满足我们的要求。
实际上，Finder 一直以来都允许用户向工具栏添加任意文件夹、文件或者应用程序图标。 这项功能宣传得很少，但实用性很强，在「大额头」设计的今天更是显得尤其应景。
至于方法，也极其简单，按住 Command ⌘ 键，然后将任何文件夹、文件或者应用程序的图标拖拽到想要安放的位置，松手即可。

通过这种方法添加到工具栏中的文件夹和应用，在功能上类似于 Dock 中的图标，兼有「传送门」和「篮子」两种功能，换言之：

如果直接点击，则可以打开对应的文件夹或启动应用程序
如果将某个文件图标拖动到图标上，则可以将该文件移动到对应的文件夹内，或用对应的应用程序打开该文件。

由于工具栏的「区位优势」，通过这种方法适当添加常用文件夹和应用图标，可以有效减少在整理、编辑文件时需要拖动鼠标的距离，优化操作效率。
如果想让工具栏排布显得更有序，还可以在工具栏空白处点击右键，选择「自定义工具栏」，然后拖拽添加一些「间隙」，为图标建立视觉上的分组效果。
个人而言，我习惯在工具栏添加「桌面」和「下载」文件夹图标，这样可以随时切换到这两个常用位置或将文件移动过去；应用程序图标则添加了 VS Code 和 iTerm 2，以便快速以纯文本形式查看文件，或者切换到命令行环境继续操作。
如果在添加图标后想要重新调整顺序，可以再次按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标拖动。如果想要删除已添加的图标，按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标将图标扔出工具栏即可。</span>

                    <span>鸭屎香、狗浇尿、鸡屎藤，没错这些可都是美食

最近，平地刮起一阵“鸭屎”风。一款叫“鸭屎香”的茶异军突起，突然横扫了大大小小奶茶店的菜单。
某些头部奶茶品牌直接玩起“花活儿”，把一系列“鸭屎香”做底的奶茶丢进菜单。C位的鸭屎香宝藏茶包装更叫勇猛，“鸭屎香”三个硕大的黑字印在橙色的纸杯上，旁边还此地无银地注明“我真的很香”。


微博上，话题“鸭屎香奶茶到底有多好喝”快被网友玩坏了。有的网友秉持考据精神，发帖称“帮你们试过了，没有鸭屎味”；有的则随性表示“鸭屎香真好喝，我又激情下单了”。


这款顶着“鸭屎”之名的茶到底是什么？它所代表的“名称劝退”派食物在中国是一个隐藏的狠人派别，各种硬核气味、诡异生物在这个门派中争奇斗艳。敢不敢上车来一波？


战胜鸭屎香，
还有一堆来自洪荒的气味在等你
鸭屎香的走红，一半以上的功劳来自“鸭屎”二字，猎奇的名字是打开年轻人心扉的钥匙，但鸭屎香，它到底是鸭屎味，还是香味？


鸭屎香到底是什么味？
鸭屎香名字虽野，却正儿八经出身名门，是潮汕茶叶大族凤凰单枞的直系。凤凰单枞产于潮州凤凰山附近，是乌龙江湖里出了名的耐冲泡、强回甘、香气高扬，江湖人称“茶中香水”，香到经常被误会加了香精的那种。

甚至有粉丝放过狠话：“铁观音‘七泡有余香’就让人津津乐道了，而凤凰单枞茶，你完全可以把前七泡直接倒掉！连最普通的凤凰单枞都可以冲十二泡以上。”算你狠！
凤凰单枞甚至直接用香型来命名品种，只要在市面上看到什么黄枝香、芝兰香、蜜兰香、桂花香、肉桂香、茉莉香，那都是凤凰一族的。
从这种意义上来说，鸭屎香还真的没有虚假宣传，它是真的香。

至于为什么以“鸭屎”命名，流行的说法有两种。一说它引进后种在“鸭屎土”（即黄土壤）上；二说因为当地人喝过之后都说好，茶农怕被人偷去，便丑化命名，谎称这叫鸭屎香。

鸭屎香虽然不是最老的品种，但这些年在凤凰家族里已小有名气。它易…</span>

                    <span>被子弹击穿的水壶
急救包、绷带、医疗剪……在展柜中依次整齐排列。


它们曾属于同一个人：年轻的卫生员贠宝山。


紧挨着医疗剪，一只金属水壶静静安放，壶身上浑圆的弹孔，铭刻着一段浸透血色的往事。


1951年秋天，抗美援朝战场上，炮火连绵，鲜血浸染了中马山的泥土。贠宝山穿过硝烟，抚摸一具具失去声息的身体，找寻还存活的战友救治。


战斗胶着，敌人动用了大量飞机火炮，向战场上倾泻数万吨炮弹，呛人的烟尘弥漫在阵地之上，携着火光的弹头肆无忌惮地穿梭飞射，贠宝山远远望见几十米外，班长倒在地上。


枪林弹雨，火光冲天。这短短几十米想要越过去，却难过万水千山。


就在此时，一颗炮弹猝不及防在贠宝山身旁爆炸，他一瞬间晕了过去。


等贠宝山恢复意识时，他的肠子已经顺着鲜血流到地上……


那场战斗中，贠宝山用尽最后的力气，挣扎着爬到班长身边，想要拿起水壶喂水时，却发现那只水壶早就被子弹击穿，里面的水几乎流尽。贠宝山就握着这个被击穿的水壶，永远遗憾地合上了双眼。


展柜里，被封存的水壶早已洗去血痕，或许只有斑驳的磨痕和凹凸的表面，还残留着那段烽火岁月的印记。


一旁展板上，短短数十字介绍，铭刻了一个年轻生命的终点。黑白图案定格了贠宝山的面容。照片上那个圆脸稚嫩的年轻人，牺牲于22岁的秋日——


1951年9月7日，中马山战斗中，志愿军第42军第125师第375团9连卫生员贠宝山奋勇抢救伤员，负伤后坚持不下火线，因伤势过重牺牲。立特等功，授“一级英雄”荣誉称号。


2020年10月，为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战70周年，中国人民革命军事博物馆举办主题展览，将贠宝山的故事和那只水壶纳入其中。


2020年11月，抗美援朝纪念馆网站中，一位名叫贠佳峰的网友在线上烈士名录中找到了贠宝山的名字，留言道：“致敬英雄！致敬我的爷爷！您是中国人民的骄傲！是我们永远的榜样！”

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok &quot;For You Page&quot;! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!

Hi all,
It’s almost the end of year. BetterDev has been 3 years. I never focus on growing it. All I do is just send out newsletter from thing I think will help everyone level up.
Next year, it’s going to change a bit. I will put more personal opinion on the issue. If you prefer a neutral one, as in just a list of link then let me know in the reply
How Does NTP Work?
           
NTP is a protocol intended to synchronize all computers participating in the network to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The core of the protocol is NTP’s clock discipline algorithm that adjusts the local computer’s clock time and tick frequency in response to an external source.

                    <span>Hi all,
I recently got myself into the situation where all my local git repos had the wrong remote addresses.  This was caused by a change up on our git account.  
You can see the url that git is currently using by opening the &#x27;config&#x27; file in the .git folder.  You&#x27;ll see it under the &#x27;[remote &quot;origin&quot;]&#x27; section.
Luckily this is pretty trivial to fix.  You can either update the url directly in the config file, or run the following command...
git remote set-url origin new.git.url/xyz</span>

                    <span>Destroyer is a console game I made for my codecademy CSC 101 final project. It is very similar to the game battleship. It uses 2D list to represent the board classes and objects to organize and simplify the code. I know it&#x27;s sloppy, and I&#x27;m sure more experienced devs will look at it like what is this, but it works well and I&#x27;m happy that I made it 😀

                    <span>Let&#x27;s me explain with a simple example:
console.log(&#x27;First log&#x27;);
console.log(&#x27;Second log&#x27;);
console.log(&#x27;Third log&#x27;);

As we can see, every line of code will waits for previous line to complete execution before execute next line. this is called with synchronous.
Here another example:
console.log(&#x27;First log&#x27;);
setTimeout(()&#x3D;&gt;{
    console.log(&#x27;Second log&#x27;);
},2000)
console.log(&#x27;Third log&#x27;)

setTimeout function will wait for milisecond time that set in second argument and executes anonymous function in the first arguments
First log
Third log
undefined
Second log

As we can see, Third log does not wait for Second log to execute, the method of not waiting for the previous code to complete is called asynchronous.
The best way to use asynchronous is when your website working with server to fetching data or getting response, instead of waiting all data from server fully loaded that maybe takes more than one minutes (depend on speed of your internet and server speed to resolve request) you could use asynchronous to make sure that code ahead will execute and javascript will not waiting server response to complete.</span>

I&#x27;ll be covering how to create a resell item feature to your marketplace, since this was an issue to me and to other developers to whom I have talked to. 
First, in the NFT contract, we&#x27;ll add a function to transfer the token. You may be asking why I don&#x27;t just simply use ERC721&#x27;s tranferFrom function. And the reason is that when I tested my functions, in some situations requests reverted with &quot;transfer caller is not owner nor approved&quot;, even though msg.sender &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ownerOf(tokenId) asserted true. So my solution was to write a custom transfer function. But feel free to share the solution for this stra…</span>

                    <span>Help users with vision disabilities find a search


Usually we know how to place a search for users without vision disabilities. But how should we do that for users with disabilities?
There is a special search role in the WAI-ARIA standard that we should add for the form element. In this case screen readers will start to display search in the &quot;Regions list&quot; mode that is used by users for navigation.
Pay attention, if we don&#x27;t do that search will not be displayed in this mode. So it will hamper users start interaction with search. They will have to find a search using common keys. It&#x27;s much longer than if they use the &quot;Regions list&quot; mode.

Did you think sometimes about how better to move focus when users open elements such as modals or dialogs?

Na Convenia utilizamos o Docker Swarm para gerenciar alguns containers em produção e o Docker Swarm entrega esse tipo de deploy &quot;Zero Down Time&quot; através de uma simples configuração, porém após alguns testes em uma API sob stress constatamos que sempre ocorriam alguns erros no momento do deploy. Aprofundando a análise do que poderia causar esses erros, percebemos que podemos cometer alguns &quot;equívocos&quot; que nos impedem de ter um deploy verdadeiramente sem Down Time e ainda podemos constatar que esses &quot;equívocos&quot; são comuns em outras fe…</span>

                    <span>Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.
A couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. 
The specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh
 posted this:
Dev.to as a headless CMS
Visakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read
#react
        #javascript
        #webdev
        #opensource
      
This was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.
You&#x27;ve probably noticed several deprecations lately. It&#x27;s all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.</span>

                    <span>Hello Friends.
I finally did it. Happened about a month and a half ago. I was ✨ promoted ✨ to a senior level engineering position. Want to know the most frustrating part about it? It didn&#x27;t feel like I deserved it. Yes, imposter syndrome sticks with you.
I started my career as a software engineer five years ago after working a job as a developer at a small startup that just needed hands and thoughts which I kinda see as my boot camp experience.
I started my &quot;engineering&quot; career at a larger, yet still small startup in San Francisco, where I learned a lot, but not enough to become a senior there. I did primarily backend work with a spattering of frontend excursions. I got close to senior at that company. So close that my manager wasn&#x27;t able to pinpoint anything specific to work on.
I was goo…</span>

What is a Proxy Server
Proxy Server types


Forward Proxy
Reverse Proxy
Reverse Proxy Implementation


Step 1: Create origin server
Step 2: Create a reverse proxy server
Step 3: Forward a client request to the origin server (via reverse proxy)
Step 4: Copy origin server response to the client (via reverse proxy)
Common errors
Conclusion



Proxy server is a server that provides a gateway between the client (Alice) and the origin server (Bob). Instead of connecting directly to the origin server (to fulfill a resource request), client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required action a origin server on the client behalf (e.g. get current time).

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。
下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。

一、历史回顾
Web 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。

Web 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。

二、Web3 的特征
Web3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。

我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。
Web 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。
娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。
在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。
三、虚拟世界
所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。
到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。
四、Web3 是分布式的
这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！
这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：
（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；
（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。
五、区块链的作用
如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。
这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。
一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。
另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。
六、数字资产
区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。
如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。

举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。
我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。
我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。
创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说：&quot;Web3 就是所有权&quot;，就是这个意思。

如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。
目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。

                    <span>树莓派是一个小巧的设备，由英国树莓派基金会开发的微型单板，设计的目标是以低价硬件和自由软件促进学校的基本计算机科学教学。麻雀虽小，树莓派本身也是一个五脏俱全的计算机，并且提供通用的 USB 接口、RJ45 网口以及 GPIO 排针接口予以扩展。且由于其较低的售价，受到了各种人群的喜欢。
但是，并不是喜欢树莓派的所有人都有计算机科学的背景，相当大一部分小白都在通过关注极客玩家们的教程，一步一步跟着教程操作来复刻他们做出来的东西。可是，尽管有了教程的帮助，小白在实际操作的过程中也还是会遇到很多失败的情况且不知道如何独立解决。
所以我打算向大家介绍 Balena 这个一站式的解决方案。
Balena： 完整的生态
Balena 是一套完整用于开发、部署、管理 IOT 设备，并提供了云用于连接这些 IOT 设备们的工具和服务。它包括了：

balenaEngine 是一个为嵌入式设备优化的运行引擎，等同于 Docker 的存在，但胜在软件体积更小，需要传输的镜像层更小，内存占用也更少。
balenaOS 是一个极简的 Linux 系统，不同于 Raspberry Pi OS，仅包含了 balenaEngine 以及一些必要的系统组件，使得硬件资源能够被最大化目标软件的使用，但借助 Balena 的其他服务，又可以很轻松的部署我们想要的工具。。
balenaHub 是一个类似 Github 的地方，开发者把软件装载进 balenaOS 中并发布到这里，用户可以从这里免费下载已经打包好的「系统镜像」。
balenaEtcher 是一个开源跨平台的系统镜像烧录工具，有精美易用的 UI 界面，可以把上述系统镜像烧录到 tf 卡中，然后插入树莓派直接开始使用。
balenaFin 一个建立于树莓派计算模块之上的开发板，有更好的存储和电源扩展等。
balenaCloud 就是承载了上述的开发交…</span>

                    <span>前言
随着安全和隐私意识的增强，越来越多的人已经在提供手机号、银行卡号时越发慎重，也知道每一个服务都要尽量使用不同的随机强密码。相比之下，邮箱地址的安全性此前受到的关注并不够充分。其实，邮箱地址也是个人信息的一部分，在交出之前值得多加提防。想象一下，如果能每一次注册都使用不同的随机匿名邮箱，是不是也很酷？
其实，这样的匿名邮箱服务正在变得主流。在 9 月推出的 iOS 15 上，Apple 更新了「iCloud+」功能，其中就包含一项名为「Hide My Email」的匿名邮箱服务；11 月 16 日，Firefox 浏览器也推出了类似的 Firefox Relay 功能。算上之前入局的 Fastmail、DuckDuckGo 等，匿名邮箱的选择前所未有地多。本文中，我们就对这些主流的匿名邮箱服务做一比较，帮助大家选择。
邮箱别名——简易版邮箱匿名方案
在正式对比之前，有必要简单提几句「邮箱别名」（alias）功能。这项功能早在很久之前就被不少邮箱服务所支持，可以看作一种简易版的匿名邮箱方案。具体而言，别名相当于邮箱地址的一个「小号」或「昵称」，发到别名的邮件会和主邮箱共享收件箱。
加号地址
创建别名最简单、通用的方法就是在邮箱地址的域内部分（即俗话说的用户名）后面加上加号（「+」）和任意字符串，常用的 Gmail、Outlook、iCloud 等邮箱服务均支持这个技巧。（加号地址是由 RFC5233 标准定义的，该标准并没有限制用什么符号作为别名的分隔符，但实践中绝大多数邮件服务都采用加号。）
举个例子，你有一个邮箱地址是 sspai@gmail.com，那么发送给 sspai+aaa@gmail.com、sspai+bbb@gmail.com 的邮件都会发送到 sspai@gmail.com 这个地址。
方便是方便，但如果是出于隐私保护而这么做，会有两个问题：

                    <span>事实上，平台的老旧对产品品质的影响还是很重要的，所以我们在买车的时候非常有必要了解对意向车型的生产平台进行了解。
举例，比如一款车换代车型即将上市，旧款（上一代）车型依然在售，如果这时候买了旧款就有些可惜了，相当于是买到了上一代的技术。那如果二手车呢？举个典型例子，都是登记日期在2018-2020年之间的丰田卡罗拉，价格差别不大，车况各有不同。如果你了解12代卡罗拉来自TNGA平台，11代卡罗拉于2019年7月停产，在车况和价格没有太大差别情况下，就一定要选择车身铭牌的出厂日期在2019年7月之后的12代卡罗拉(也可以看后悬架，扭力梁的都是老平台车型)。

为什么？当然是冲着TNGA平台啊，比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构（更准确说法是架构）所产车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。这也就是说来自TNGA架构的第12代卡罗拉，操控性能和驾驶乐趣，包括安全性方面比上一代车型有了显著提高。同样的，这也适用于凯美瑞，只是凯美瑞两代车型之间外观内饰有明显区别，比较不容易混在一块儿（买二手车时）。

尽管平台的最大意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而帮企业节省成本，但从消费者的角度，理论上，新的造车平台比旧（上一代）的更加先进和高级。因此，他也能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。
比如说，大众现在MQB平台的车型，比上一代PQ25/35平台产品在轻量化方面就有了明显提高，用户获得的好处自然是节约了油费。前面也提到了，丰田TNGA架构下的新一代车型，操控方面都比以往有了显著提高，哪怕卡罗拉这样的标准“买菜车”，开起来也不再平庸乏味。
再看现在流行的电动车，以往很多电动车往往是“油改电”的过渡性产品，会在电机、电池摆布、车内空间、行驶及安全品质等方面出现很多不够完善的地方，而来自全新的纯电车造车平台的电动车就很好地解决了这一问题。

总的来说，新旧平台的产品尽量选新的，但凡事没绝对，某些新平台车型的某些细节甚至还不如旧平台车型，比如PQ46的斯柯达昊锐，反而比MQB平台的速派，在底盘厚重感、转向手感方面主观感受更好。此外，老款车型在产品生涯末期往往有较大优惠，如果一些产品点上的差异消费者本身也不是很敏感，那倒也没有什么。  

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。
目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

路上偶然遇见的河




这一次，我们两家、六人、一辆房车，从丽江出发到拉萨，然后原路返回。美景的图片集锦已经发过了，今天就发一发这一路记录的日记吧。。。
28日 第一天 大理到丽江到香格里拉
早上7点半，我们迎着大理的朝霞出发了，第一站就是去丽江的房车生活家提车点取房车。
在沟通了解房车事项近五个小时之后，我们终于出发了，奔向我们的目的地，西藏。这对于我们，对于四岁的孩子们来说，将是一个未知又充满惊喜的挑战！
特意从丽江玉龙雪山脚下转了一圈后，晚上我们到达香格里拉古城附近的广场。逛了夜晚的独克宗古城，给开了一天车的爸爸们补充能量，吃了一顿牦牛肉大餐。
夜晚的香格里拉真冷啊，让我们几个大人有了一种回到大学宿舍的感觉，水是刺骨的，但想象着我们领略着世界第三极绝美的风光，心中就充满了期待。







29日 香格里拉到梅里雪山
前一晚的房车睡眠着实让人为接下来越来越冷的行程捏一把汗，一边担心孩子们受冻着凉，一边又不甘心就这样放弃掉。好在云南冬日的阳光总是让人感觉到温暖，上午推开房车门的阳光消除了所有的担心，我们决定带着孩子坚持走下去。
洗漱完毕就踏上了最爱的菜市场环节，香格里拉的菜市场，有堆成尖的奶酪，有黄色的白色的，我们在好奇心驱使下买了一块“甜的奶酪”，结果让人难以入口，像吃坏掉的奶渣一样，可能这种美食我们的嘴是无福消受了。但是买到的牦牛肉、藏香猪和苹果让我们重拾信心，出发前我们就定好了要买这边的肉做烤肉，买到了就刻不容缓，直奔野营地——浓雾顶。那是在图片上才能看到平视梅里雪山的地方，运气好就能看到日出金山和梅里雪山的顶峰。带着几分祈祷，我们又踏上了路途。
晚上周转了很久才在寻问下找到了露营地，可惜太晚了天已经黑了，我们围坐在篝火旁，吃起了新鲜的牦牛肉，孩子们在旁边刨坑挖土，做着扮演…</span>

Stepping into a DMV when you&#x27;re about to take your first driver&#x27;s test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral &quot;drivers license&quot; (hence the DMV locale and its &quot;interesting vibes.&quot;) Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and so…</span>

Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one. Because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy ten minute videos and unfortunately, reality is, well, complicated. The question of how we deal with that, is central to what we do on this channel and something we think about a lot.

                    <span>casey neistat film school enrollment at https://monthly.com/casey

my 30-day online filmmaking &amp; storytelling class just launched! Enrollment is open now until December 27.  the class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience, designed to teach you everything I know about filmmaking and storytelling, i&#x27;m going to share with you my entire creative process from start to finish. You&#x27;re going to follow along with me as I create 2 brand new movies from scratch... from how I come up the ideas, all the way through exporting the final videos.

over the month, you&#x27;ll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 2 original, shareable films of your own.  its is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. I spent the past year working on it, and I&#x27;m extremely proud of the result. It&#x27;s designed to level you up whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a more experienced filmmaker.

The class officially starts on January 10, 2022, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you&#x27;re interested

(also In the video, I say it&#x27;s $300, but it&#x27;s actually $249)

pysftp for creating SSH connections to different servers. 
If you need a different library, the approach should be the same, assuming it&#x27;s installable using pip or pip3. 
Unfortunately we didn’t have access to Container Registry (ECR) so we couldn&#x27;t create a docker container, which would have allowed us to install the dependencies as part of the docker container creation.
We instead had to create &amp; upload a zip file containing our application code and dependencies.
While we could include the application dependencies in the zip we upload, this has a few disadvantages:
It slows down each upload, which is not ideal as you might end up u…</span>

In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll build a dashboard on top of postgresSQL database. This is a simple dashboard showing a view of projects and users stored in the database. We&#x27;ll use React for frontend, semantic-ui for UI library, Canonic for creating APIs, and to add some graphics we&#x27;ll use recharts library.
We&#x27;re looking to create something like this:

It was a regular screening interview with someone from another part of the world sitting in the same-furniture office.
Rainy weather in winter does not help to focus at all, and I go to get some coffee. Being sleepy is something I want to avoid at all costs. Pouring over Columbian coffee gives a brain energy spike. It is important to have fifteen minutes before the interview starts. You need to switch focus away from the routine. 
A notebook with a pen are prepared to record the candidate&#x27;s answers, emotions, body language, and my quick feedback.

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Dec. 2nd we had our second Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 2. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.
Did any of the types listed surprise you?
What great examples have you seen of a particular content type? What stands out about it?
Sarah Rainsberger mentioned she found the distinction between a “Tutorial” and a “How to Guide” interesting. She liked that the book made these two content types distinct.

                    <span>Probably, you have used the speedtest website before, but did you know that speedtest has a python library.
In this tutorial, We will learn to use the speedtest library to test your internet Speed. We&#x27;ll also learn how to use speedtest command lines.
Let&#x27;s get started. 
To install speedtest via pip, follow this command:
pip install speedtest-cli

After installing the speedtest package. Now, let&#x27;s see how to use it with the code.
In the following code, I&#x27;ll test my internet download speed.
import speedtest

# Speed test
st &#x3D; speedtest.Speedtest()

# Download Speed
ds &#x3D; st.download()

print(ds)

let me explain.
First, we import the speedtest package. Then, called Speedtest() class. Next, test my download speed using the download() method. Finally, print the result.

What is version control?
What is git?
How does git work?
What is GitHub?
What is the difference between git and GitHub?
It is a way to document the code you use for analysis. 
Git is a distributed Version Control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux Kernel, that makes tracking code over time easy and effortless.
Git:
Tracks iterative change that&#x27;s made to the code one tells it to manage. Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.


It facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. 


Easily switches between Versions of your code.


Easily undo changes.




  
  
  What is GitHub?🤔


First, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
Git is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.
Git is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.
Can&#x27;t be any simpler than that!!

                    <span>I was working around a few days back, managing the release of the project with versioning and proper tags associated with it which results in writing the python code.
I have written a simple python function that will call the API of GitHub and will Create/Fetch /Delete the release on GitHub.
Note** You can manage the same with CURL command too but I was facing some authentication issue, so haven’t done, I haven’t tried with explicitly passing the auth token in header by -H tag, you can give a try.
Have a look at the below snippet of code which can be easily integrated with Jenkins pipeline
&#x60;# Begin
user &#x3D; &quot;&quot;             #username of github account
https://api.github.com&quot;
Here, tag_name and releaseId variables are only required if you want to delete a particular release, which you will rarely come across.
# Fetch latest release from github


The above code will be used to fetch the latest release present on GitHub.
# Create latest release on github


This snippet of code is used to create the release on GitHub, which contains payload in JSON format.
release.json will look something like below,
{


Even with this payload, you can easily create prerelease of the master branch, which can be tested in the Staging environment.
# Delete release from github by passing tag_name &amp; releaseId


The above deletion method is not often required.
The full script is available in the below repository.
Github Link: https://github.com/nik0811/github-release-api.git
Feel free to comment below, if you will found any mistakes or required any type of modifications/enhancement. The code is fully tested so hopefully, you will not find any issues.</span>

                    <span>What is Samba ?


We know that when you think of samba, you immediately think of happy Brazilians dancing.

But.. We are so sorry because situation here is not quite what you think. (We know that you are trying to hide your bewilderment because we experienced the same at the beginning.)
So it always happens like this...

Now let&#x27;s come to our main topic, what is the real samba we are talking about?
SAMBA is a project developed in 1991 by re-adapting the SMB network protocol as free software with reverse engineering methods.
However, it is also worth mentioning that the difference from the default SMB protocol to which it is implemented progresses in a path and version map.
For example, SAMBA 3 released in 2003, enabled the integration of file and printer services between GNU/Linux systems …</span>

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m glad the comment happened when it did. It is better than never getting it, but think about the time that was just lost. 😱
As the reviewer, I treat this as a smell. What can we do better to make this reusable code more obvious? 
Better documentation? 
As the author, I feel lazy. How did I miss that we already do this? 
I am new to my current codebase, and I have had this happen a few times already. I knew the codebase at my previous company like the back of my hand. I would tell new folks to assume the code you need to write is already there. Sometimes it is true, sometimes not. But it was a healthy assumption that saved them time an…</span>

                    <span>继 Beats Studio Buds 在 7 月推出之后，没想到还没半年时间，Beats 今年还有新品发布。与前者一样，Beats 最新推出的 Beats Fit Pro 是一款真无线蓝牙降噪耳机，不同的是，这款耳机搭载了 Apple H1 芯片，除了主动降噪和通透模式，它还支持空间音频、iCloud 同步、自动切换等新功能，售价 1,599 元。

外观设计
Beats Fit Pro 的充电盒与 2019 年推出的 Powerbeats Pro 类似，方形圆润的设计，尺寸比后者稍小、比 AirPods Pro 的充电盒更大一些。类肤质材质的运用也是现在 Beats 产品的「标配」。类肤质材质表面的缺点也很明显，容易沾染指纹、油污，需要经常清洁；当然，好处是不容易产生划痕等不可修复的损伤。

虽然充电盒尺寸接近 Powerbeats Pro，Beats Fit Pro 的耳机大小可是实实在在地小了不少，尺寸与 AirPods Pro 和 AirPods 可以说是差不多一致。同样作为入耳式耳机，由于没有「侵入感」明显的耳挂式设计，Beats Fit Pro 的佩戴体验自然比 Powerbeats Pro 要好上不少，个人认为与 AirPods Pro 的入耳感受接近。不同的是，Beats Fit Pro 用上了一个全新的耳翼式设计。

此前市面上采用耳翼式设计的耳机，多是提供了多个尺寸的可更换耳翼选择，以让用户实现稳定舒适的佩戴体验。Beats Fit Pro 则直接通过柔韧性更好的软性硅胶材料打造通用型耳翼，让耳翼能够根据不同耳形大小达到灵活弯折的效果，让不同用户都能轻松佩戴。
据 Beats 介绍，Beats Fit Pro 的耳翼基于人体工学设计，外形和选材经过大量用户的运动数据测试和验证，不仅耐用、稳定，还优化了耳机的佩戴贴合度和⻓时间佩戴的舒适度，确保声学性能不…</span>

在我卖掉 iPad Air 3 而买了 iPad mini 6 之后，就一直在为其物色一款合适的键盘。
之前 Air 3 一直使用的都是官方 Smart Keyboard：价格奇贵、手感奇差、还不能保护背面。但无需充电、吸上即用，拥有任何其他键盘都无法相比的一体性。
可惜的是，Apple 并未给 iPad mini 提供官方的键盘解决方案，而是仅注明了其支持「蓝牙键盘」。
iPad mini 仅支持蓝牙键盘
这并不奇怪，毕竟 iPad mini 的尺寸决定了它更偏向于一款内容消费设备，而非生产设备。不过这也不妨碍我为 mini 选配一款便携式的蓝牙键盘，以随时随地完成轻量的文字处理任务。
那些被我淘汰的备选项
我最先看中的是 Logitech 的 Keys-To-Go 键盘。作为上架 Apple Store 的产品，这款键盘有着简洁漂亮的外观和专为 iOS 设备优化的快捷键。同时，作为非折叠式的传统键盘，Keys-To-Go 的尺寸也只有 24.2*13.7 cm，仅仅比 iPad mini 6 (19.5*13.5 cm) 大上一点。抛开略显昂贵的售价 (¥480) 不谈，它的确是 iPad mini 的理想搭档。

不过，经过一番搜索，我也成功被 Keys-To-Go 的问题劝退了。首先是耐用性。有不少网友（1, 2, 3, 见评论区）都表示 Keys-To-Go 在使用一两年之后，可能会出现按键鼓包等现象，这样的耐用性让我很难把它当作「传家宝」。
有关按键鼓包的评论不少

                    <span>作为一个主打内容创作的社区，少数派中大家讨论最多的可能就是写作工具了，而其中以语法简单，专注于内容创作著称的 Markdown 编辑器则是其中的焦点，从以优雅的设计和易用性著称的 Ulysses 和 MWeb，再到主打同步的 Bear 等一系列写作工具，其实都向我们展示了 Markdown 这样一款语法简单的语言是如何真正的提高文字创作者效率的。而作为一位「老少数派」，我则从 2015年开始全面转向 Markdown 写作，只不过一开始我就在使用本文的主角—— Typora，一开始选择其实最看重的跨平台特性：在 Windows 平台上很难再找到一款颜值上线的 Markdown 编辑器了。

在发布首个测试版的之后的第六年，这款「纯粹」的 Markdown 编辑器也正式发布了首个 1.0 正式版。同时上线的还有其收费计划——买断式付费，可激活三台设备，如果大版本更新可能还要另外收费，费用为 89 元人民币。在习惯性「白嫖」六年后，正式宣布收费也引起了不小的争议，那么这样一款纯粹的 Markdown 编辑器是否真的值得付费？或许看完本篇全方面的测评，你会在心中留下你自己的答案。
真正意义上的全桌面平台支持
相比某些只是支持单一平台的 Markdown 编辑器，Typora 在最早期就开始对多个平台的支持，除了最为常见的 macOS 以及 Windows 之外，还支持 Linux 桌面环境，并且所有的平台的外观以及功能都保持了高度的一致。

而在本次 1.0 正式版中，Typora 进一步提供了几乎全桌面平台的支持，这里不仅仅是系统层面的，还包括系统架构。除了包含了在此前测试版中我们就已经熟知的 x86 /x86-64，还加入了对 ARM64 版 Windows 以及 Linux 的支持，尤其是在类似树莓派这样的单板电脑中，也有了设计美观的 Markdown 可用。

                    <span>Google has rolled out new features to Pixel phones outside of the usual Android OS updates for years, but more recently, the company has started calling them “Feature Drops.” Feature drops are released every three months, typically with a security patch, and the last one came in the form of the Android 12 platform update.

                    <span>我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。
我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。
为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。
翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：
随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug
还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：
可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动
这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。
展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：
这个项目放弃前的一段录屏
我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。
所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！

                    <span>游戏音频，即是存在于游戏世界里的一切声音，然而大家是否能够想象，在如今的一款开放大世界游戏中，存在的声音文件数量也许不是以千计，也不是以万计，而是以十万计。
在越来越庞大且复杂的游戏面前，游戏音频早已不是什么隐于背景中的音乐，仅由几位神秘的音乐艺术家就能闭门完成。在才华与灵感之外，AI 算法、机器学习、Object-Based Audio 技术、跨国合研等先进技术与模式，也已悄然融入游戏音频这块依旧让人略感陌生的领域。

游戏音频到底是什么？正在经历哪些新趋势？未来将如何发展？我们邀请到了来自天美音频中心的六位音频专家，其中有一直与天美共同成长的中国设计师，也有来自海外 3A 游戏厂商的外籍专家。他们将与我们分享对游戏音频的热爱，以及对其未来发展的展望。


—— 我认为非线性声音设计是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
大家好！我是 Beej Paz，我已经在游戏行业摸爬滚打了 13 年，加入天美之前，我在育碧担任音频总监。
游戏音频是我毕生热爱的事业，我认为非线性声音设计，是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
当玩家在游戏中的决策/行动有了意义时，我们就能以此为切入点，让音频发挥作用。如果声音设计能够更贴近玩家、更具有意义，那么我们也能顺利建立起与玩家之间连接的纽带和信任。
音频带来的愉悦和沉浸感可以让玩家得到情感上的满足，塑造一个又一个的“感觉棒极了”的时刻。我们为玩家打造出的这些“魔力”时刻，不仅能够启发灵感，还将影响下一代从业者对未来游戏音频的观念。
我们总是从过去和现在的那些伟大前辈们身上得到启发，收获灵感。这是一种传承，我们这代游戏音频人就是这么过来的。

                    <span>写在前面：感谢天美同事帮我把想法翻译成了中文跟大家交流。以下所有配图都是公开图片，仅供专业探讨，所以请不要指望这里可以看到拳头或者育碧的机密信息；）
大家好，我是 Francois Dallaire，坐标新加坡，目前是天美 F1 工作室的技术美术专家（Principal Tehnical Artist），已有过十多年的技术美术从业经验。
多年来，中国手游在海外的成绩一直很亮眼，但直到近一两年，我们才逐渐看到中国游戏公司在 AAA 游戏研发上与日俱增的兴趣。
在此之前，很多 AAA 大作都有中国开发者参与，但大多是负责部分模块或者作为外包团队，很少能主导完整的项目。现在中国工作室开发自己的 AAA 项目，招揽和借助全球 AAA 人才的经验来起步也是很正常的事情。在西方，这种 AAA 公司间的人才流动早已成为常态。
与此同时，中国游戏公司在研发技术上的进步也很引人注目。比如 2018 年在游戏开发者大会（GDC）上亮相的虚拟人 Siren，展现了中国游戏公司对于次世代研发技术的探索，吸引了许多像我一样的全球游戏研发从业者的注意。我相信中国游戏开发者已经做好准备，迎接新的挑战。

随着中国游戏公司加入 AAA 游戏的全球化研发潮流，这成为了一个双向选择的过程。游戏公司在寻找特定领域的资深人才，而人才也在寻找有潜力的项目。
就我所知，技术相关的岗位往往最先受到关注，比如技术美术、技术动画等。经过种种考虑，我选择加入了有 13 年自研积累的天美，相信这里的项目会为我带来更广阔的职业前景。
全球化研发潮流下的技术美术
放在 15 年前，游戏行业还不存在技术美术（Technical artists，以下简称 TA）岗位，但随着行业的发展，TA 已越来越受重视，并成为当前中国游戏行业最紧缺的岗位之一。
我从事 TA 已有十余年的时间，入行之初也经历过一些变化。最初，我在动视做游戏测试（te…</span>

                    <span>Boxing superstar and five-time world champion Gervonta “Tank” Davis put his boxing skills on display, winning a rousing 12-round round unanimous decision over the relentless Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz to retain his WBA Lightweight World Title in front of a star-studded, sellout crowd of 15,850 at STAPLES Center live on SHOWTIME Pay-Per-View. 
 
There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
“That’s my style. ‘Pitbull’ is always going to be on the attack,” said Cruz. “I think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.”
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis’ ribs.

                    <span>A few days ago, my friend made me a scavenger hunt on the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players&#x27; hearts... Will I be Solving my Friend&#x27;s Impossible Minecraft Puzzle...

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. 

Thanks to @Vort3xDragon for making the scavenger hunt, this was epic!

                    <span>what&#x27;s up typescript enthusiasts 👋
as seen in this tutorial?
1- Install @types/node in your project
$ yarn add @types/node -D

// or using npm

$ npm i @types/node -D

2- First of all, download the VSC extension TS Env Typings
3- Specify env-typings.json file in the root of your project.

4- Add path field to your development .env file

That&#x27;s it, Enjoy!
1- Specify path for the generated output using output field in the JSON config.

2- Auto detect env variable type so that It can give you a nice example in the intellisense on how to use and parse it.
so as an example if you&#x27;ve a number env variable It&#x27;ll tell you to use parseInt to parse it before using it cause env variables are always read as strings.

3- Variants for an env variable, so you tell the extension what are the possible values for an env variable so It can generate better types for it and recommend you a nicer example to use

add a comment at the end of the env line that includes &quot;# variants:&quot;


specify the different variants for your variable seperated by a &quot;|&quot; like you would in typscript


quotes are optional around the variants values




That&#x27;s it.
Hope you&#x27;ve a great day, curios to see your feedback 🤗</span>

                    <span>A while back, someone asked me in an interview to print &quot;Hello World&quot; in the console 50 times without using a loop.
Afterward, I start pondering... let&#x27;s find out?
If you want to check it out: https://github.com/Noriller/js-console.log
I&#x27;ve made a repository and used jest to test if everything was working, I&#x27;ve also used this auxiliary function:
function Log() {
  console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}

Most were just variations of the same thing... but I did manage to make it work in some unexpected ways.
Because... why not?
Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log…</span>

                    <span>Things rarely go as planned, especially in the world of programming. Errors are unavoidable when writing code, which can be frustrating at times. 
via GIPHY
In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to handle exceptions in Python.
An exception is an error that occurs while the program is running. In some cases, an exception may cause the program to stop or produce unexpected results. For example, taking a look at Fig 1.0. This program gets two numbers from the user and divides the first number by the second number, and displays the result. However, when the program is run, an exception occurs as shown in Fig 1.1.

Fig 1.0



Fig 1.1


The error message displayed in Fig 1.1 is called a traceback. A traceback provides information about the line number(s) that resulted in the exception. In Fig. 1.1,…</span>

                    <span>Episode 11: Use the Filesystem Class to Read a Directory



In this episode, we create a Post model class and move the post finding code from the route definition to the Mode class method find(). We add another method all() to this class where we fetch all posts from the resource/posts directory. We use the Laravel File Facades Illuminate\Support\Facades\File fetch all the files from a directory into an array. 
Contributed to the Blog project:
Move post finding logic from route def to a Model class
Make the posts index page dynamic by getting file contents using the Laravel File Facades
Before:
Route::get(&#x27;/posts/{post}&#x27;, function ($slug) {
    $path &#x3D; __DIR__.&quot;/../resources/posts/{$slug}.html&quot;;

No fear, this is not a tutorial. This is more of a strategic guide. Decision makers will continue reading. Apply these concepts to your project.
Opinion. After deploying countless websites, you will see the narrow difference between tech stacks. Python, PHP, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, and others all write HTTP responses. This uniformity means developers can pass all HTTP handling through a standardized web server interface like Apache/NGINX.
 
Web servers are a MUST and highly optimized for driving web traffic. Apache/NGINX fulfill common needs such as simultaneous requests, encryption, and &quot;path rewriting&quot; (sales). Businesses that do not use quintessential web servers are doomed to face early scaling issues.

Read more about Conductor here: https://github.com/Netflix/conductor
Visit our codebase and give us a star, it helps! :)
Conductor can orchestrate HTTP services out of the box without implementing any code.  We will use that to create and run our first workflow.
To follow the steps in this article we will need to have Conductor running on your local. We can do that by following the steps here
This is a sample workflow that we can leverage for our test.

                    <span>The terminal can be an intimidating place for anyone, like me, who has spent most of their life living in a ✨Graphical User Interface✨ paradise. 
In the GUI, it seems like nothing can really go that wrong. However, on the command line, it feels like a single cat-on-keyboard moment can bring everything crashing down. 🐱🔥
It is my belief that the terminal itself is not what frightens us, but the unfamiliarity of it all. Once you build up your confidence, the terminal can, and will, be your new best friend. 👯 I promise!
The first time I entered the terminal, I had no idea where I was. You don&#x27;t believe me? Look at the first 15 commands I ever ran: 
 Unfortunately, hello and where am i, yielded no results. You know what did? Making a ton of mistakes, which I like to call, &quot;practice.&quot; (I real…</span>

                    <span>At Arbington.com we use Stripe.com to handle all of our payments. 
It&#x27;s secure, fast, and honestly it&#x27;s a developers dream.
For this, you should be familiar with Ajax/Fetch requests and being able to work with an API. We use Python on the backend, so we use Stripes&#x27;s Python API. 
We will show some demo code, but you&#x27;ll need to fill in the blanks. 
First, you&#x27;ll need a Stripe.com account. It&#x27;s free to setup, and they give you two sets of API keys:
A test pair of public and private keys 
A live pair of public and private keys 
The test keys will make payments to your test account, and toggling between testing data and real payment data is as easy as clicking a toggle button in their dashboard. 
Two things to note about Stripe:

                    <span>In honour of Hannukah this year, I undertook to write 8 web components tips, one for each night of the festival. Tonight is the 8th and final night of the festival. The mystics said that this night combines and contains aspects of each of the seven previous nights, so I&#x27;d like to share a compilation of those tips with the dev community.
Wishing you and yours a fully Lit Hannukah!
Did you know you can add reactive controllers to an element via a class or field decorator? You don&#x27;t even need to assign it to an instance property!

  return function(klass) {

                    <span>The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays. Array is a special type of object that is mutable and it is used to store multiple values.
In this article, we will implement our own array methods from scratch. These implementations don&#x27;t intend to replace the existing methods but to provide a better understanding of how these methods work and their uses.



Methods

大家好，太久没有发文章了。
很多朋友关注这个号可能是因为学习 React Naitve 的过程中，看到了我前几年在网上分享的 RN 的文章。至今都有人通过公众号找到我，问我 RN 的东西。
我已经没有在使用 RN 了，也没有继续关注 RN 社区了。因为现在全面转到 Flutter 了，从 2019 年开始到现在，也已经有好几个项目在生产环境中投产了，表现的都还不错。
无论是从性能表现，还是开发体验，Flutter 都要优于 RN，唯一不足的可能就是 Dart 增加了一些入门的门槛。但其实都是较为现代编程语言，无论你之前使用的是 Kotlin，Swift，JS， TS，其实都能找到很多相同的地方。比如变量的声明，数据结构等，所以我觉得那一点代价可以忽略不计。
尤其在我自己饱受了几年 RN 的红屏之苦，还有那完全靠运气随机表现的 Hot Reload 功能，都是促使我切换到 Flutter 的原因。
以上有点扯远了，只不过因为时不时就有人加我微信问诸如此类的问题，所以难得写一篇文章就顺便也说一下我个人的想法。可能会对一些正在犹豫的，考虑二选一的朋友们提供一些参考。
Demo演示
下面说回到正文上来，先看一段 Demo 吧。

我个人有定期备份照片的习惯，之前没有微信的时候，大家用优盘来共享照片，所以那个时候文件都能很好的被管理。因为照片的 EXIF 信息很完整。但是自从有了微信以后，我有很多照片都是来自于家人或者朋友的微信，估计很多人和我一样，尤其是有了小孩以后。
大家应该都知道，微信保存照片的名称，一般都是一段 &#x27;mmexport&#x27; 前缀加上一个时间戳，这对于整理大量图片来说特别不友好，因为我希望照片可以按照事件发生的时间按月整理，但是微信导出图片视频的这个时间戳，是你保存图片的那个时间，而且时间戳也没有办法一眼让我分辨出这是几月份拍摄的。
最开始我想的是找一个可以批量重命名的软件，但是很快又发现一个问题，这些软件们，基本都只能定义一个策略，所有的图片都只能用创建时间，更新时间或者记录时间中的一个来批量重命名。

然而不知道什么原因，我发现有些照片的 Exif 信息并不完整，要么没有记录时间，要么就是创建时间晚于更新时间。我想应该是被一些其他的比如修图软件之类 App 编辑过吧。所以这个策略就会增加一些人工过滤的成本。
所以我就想只要在批量重命名的时候，选择创建时间，更新时间，记录时间，微信时间戳中，最早的一个时间来作为文件名的一部分就可以了。刚开始想的是写一个脚本来处理这个事就好了，但是转到 Flutter 以后还没有用它开发过桌面端，所以就想顺便试一下。
开发历程
经过两天的开发，现在软件基本核心的重命名的功能已经实现了，UI也大概完成了30%左右吧。本来抱着试一试的态度，没想到 Flutter 真的可以（可能写个脚本用起来更方便）。
再一次觉得 Flutter 才是跨平台开发的未来，这种轻而易举就可以将业务扩展到其他平台的能力，真的太有想象空间了。
尽管这个项目初衷只想面向桌面端（macOS，windows）而已，但是我也在手机上试了下，大体上也可以用，只不过UI可能有点奇怪。所以暂时先不打算适配手机端了。
要问我什么时候可以用？我想大概就是在可以用的时候吧。（废话学么，谁不会？上一次听到这种废话，还是在上一次！）。其实主要是我自己也不知道，因为并不打算上架收费，咱们就是说，咱们这边纯纯的就一个是“激情开发，用爱发电”，所以可能随时因为一些不可抗力就终止了（比如懒，哈哈哈~）。如果一不小心写完了，也会在公众号里通知一下的。
做个小调研吧，不知道你们是否需要这个软件呢？可以评论下。
最后，想问下有没有哪个小伙伴愿意帮忙设计一下 UI 和 Logo 呢？因为没有收入所以也只能是义务劳动了，先提前谢谢了。
以防有人问，目前没有打算开源。</span>

                    <span>近期，Mental Canvas 这款特殊的 iPad 绘画 App 凭借其独特的画作展示效果闯入了公众视野。

简单来说，这是一款拥有「3D 画布」的草图绘画工具，你可以将图层分别放置于立体空间中的不同位置，最后得以通过运动的「摄像机」来展示整个画作。

Mental Canvas 目前提供的功能数量不算多，本文将逐一详细介绍，作为简单的使用教程提供给各位参考。  
界面排布
Mental Canvas 除了画布界面外没有设置其他界面，在打开 App 时会立刻创建一个新项目。操作界面中的按钮排布和交互设计的逻辑与大多同类产品存在较大出入，说实话这让我在刚上手时有一点懵。
界面中设有「顶部工具栏」、左侧的「画布及图层列表」、底部的用于定位摄像机的「时间轴」，共三个板块。顶部工具栏从左至右可以分为「操作区」「绘制区」「定位区」和「模式切换开关」四个区域。（当然，这些都是我自拟的名字。）

绘制区
在顶部工具栏中的绘制区可以点选使用「画笔工具」「橡皮擦工具」「油漆桶工具」来进行作画。选中画笔工具后再次点击该按钮可以展开画笔设置界面，提供了更改画笔类型和调节画笔粗细的选项。

这三个按钮右侧有「调色盘」按钮，展开后可以进行取色或自定义颜色。

选取调整界面
位于绘制区最左侧的是「选取调整」按钮，选中后会在顶部工具栏置换为一系列新按钮，实质上是进入了选取调整界面。顶部工具栏左侧的区域为「选取区」，右侧为「调整区」。

选取区
选取区的按钮用于选取图层内的部分内容以便调整，其中提供了「按笔画选取」和「套索选取」两种选取方式，分别可以选择画面中一部分笔画或选择圈选的部分区域作为选区。其余的按钮分别为「向选区添加」「从选区减去」「取消选取」「反选」。
调整区
调整区包含几种对选区的调整操作，从左至右分别是用于修改选区部分颜色的「重上色」、清除选区内容的「删除」、启用后会使后几个调整改为对…</span>

2021 年 11 月 12 日，宫崎英高又一次「跌入」神坛。这次倒也没别的，只是万代南梦宫于 2019 年 E3 游戏展上亮相的新作《艾尔登法环》终于开始了发售前的首次封闭网络测试。虽然仍在监修的游戏内容在封测中的表现依然需要打磨，但其优秀的总体质量和极高的媒体热度已然将玩家们对游戏跳票的不满冲刷殆尽，万代南梦宫甚至宣布该作的首发预期销量高达 400 万份，综合宫崎英高作品一贯的强口碑和高销量，这个数字似乎还显得保守了那么一点。
如今作为世界知名游戏发行商的万代南梦宫同时也是任天堂的最强游戏代工厂，其下属的工作室有半数以上为任天堂开发游戏。仅在 NS 平台，除去万代南梦宫自家发售的各类粉丝向冷饭之外，《马力欧赛车 8》这样的第一方大作有半数以上的内容由万代南梦宫参与制作，而《任天堂全明星大乱斗：特别版》这样的爆款游戏则是全盘交给万代南梦宫承包。众所周知，万代南梦宫在玩家群体中一直被归类为「任黑」，但这两家公司在游戏开发事务上的密切关系却形成了一种奇怪的 CP 感，不禁让人直呼「磕到了」。
相比起万代的小红标，这个 Logo 在游戏行业中更加为人熟知。
万代南梦宫由成立于 1950 年的万代和 1955 年的南梦宫合并而成，这两家公司是日本游戏产业的两大支柱，虽然侧重的领域有所不同，但它们都有过一个共同的合作伙伴和竞争对手：任天堂。与 1988 年就使用「替身攻击」欧拉任天堂的南梦宫不同，万代从一开始并没有那么勇。 FC 时代，作为任天堂授权厂商之一的万代自然也不满于任天堂不近人情的审查机制，与任天堂发生了一点小摩擦，不过二者之间…</span>

The Fortnite Island has been flipped and a new one has been revealed.

Due to a particularly cold winter, the first thing you’ll notice about the Island is that the western half’s a wintry biome. Perhaps stop by the suburban Greasy Grove, the industrial Logjam Lumberyard, and other locales.

For the first time in the cinematic history of Spider-Man, our friendly neighborhood hero&#x27;s identity is revealed, bringing his Super Hero responsibilities into conflict with his normal life and putting those he cares about most at risk. When he enlists Doctor Strange’s help to restore his secret, the spell tears a hole in their world, releasing the most powerful villains who’ve ever fought a Spider-Man in any universe. Now, Peter will have to overcome his greatest challenge yet, which will not only forever alter his own future but the future of the Multiverse.

                    <span>I dive into my collection of Popular Mechanics Magazines to build something from the distant past! I build an arbor press from scratch using some of my favorite tools. Then, I test it to see if it can press as hard as it claims. I demonstrate stick welding, drilling, and shimming.

Here are the tools I used:

                    <span>So, C++ extends C, and as that being the case, the implementation of varargs persisted (and hasn&#x27;t changed, since it could break already existing code).
In C, you could do #include , which included some functions for navigating the arguments.
.h files are deprecated (in C++).
So I&#x27;m wondering, what&#x27;s the effective way of using varargs in C++?</span>

                    <span>In this post I&#x27;ll demonstrate a way to understand, analyse and reduce the time complexity on algorithms, specially on nested loops.
The examples will use Ruby but it can be translated to any programming language.
Working throughout a variety of projects, it&#x27;s not rare to stumble on pieces of code like the following, a &quot;nested loop&quot;, which is a loop under another loop:
for group in groups
  for user in users
    # do something with the group and user
  end
end

Analysing the above code, and assuming we have 100 groups and 100 users:
for each group (100 times) we iterate over all users (100 times), which leads 100 * 100 &#x3D; 10000 iterations
each iteration has a cost to the CPU, so the more iterations we do, the more our algorithm will perform worse
if the lists grow over time, we can face seri…</span>

                    <span>The third minor version of Agrippa, the React component CLI, is finally out!
Since v1.2.0 came out, Agrippa has seen tremendous growth - counting the difference in stars on the GitHub repo, for example, we&#x27;ve grown by 120% (154 stars) over the course of just over 40 days! 
This is a good opportunity to say that I&#x27;m truly grateful for everyone who have tried Agrippa out and joined the community; I&#x27;m delighted to see Agrippa growing and being used, and I&#x27;m super excited for it to grow and improve further in the future.
So, thanks everyone!
Get started here.
As for the new version, this one was in the works for longer than the previous two; integration tests, in particular, were a challenge to implement.

PayPal is well known for online payments. Its credibility and developer experience have convinced many users to use it.

If I talk about the reading resources:
A developer won&#x27;t need anything further than visiting this page. I really don&#x27;t think you need anything else. Documentation
Reasons to consider this resource-
The workflow is very well explained.
The code sample is available
Steps to test out provided.
Talking about the video resources:





This is a pretty short and concise video. 
It is from the official channel of Paypal.
This video very well explains the concept of different ways to integrate on any website.
Covers all the cases and is easy to follow up.
There is one more resource, that developers can follow up. I am not promoting their channel in any manner but I liked their flow and ease to follow.
Paypal Official Source
I will not be getting into the benefits of applying on Client or Backend. That is up to the developer&#x27;s choice of preference. If I had to recommend one, then I would have to say an easy way to implement would b the first one.
Getting on to the resource, this video takes care of most of the integration:




API integration I would say. I used this node module paypal-checkout
Installing it was very easy.
The npm page was
also very helpful and informative.
This resource has Video tutorials.
Demo app space and much more cool stuff.
This was all enough for integration I think. Moving ahead, I will be sharing my reviews of my experience. Learning was also easy as I expected, the official support and documentation were very helpful. But the

CircleCI offers several execution environments. Those bold nerds from San Francisco call them executors. An executor defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job. Set up your jobs to run in the docker, machine, macos or windows executor and specify an image with the tools and packages you need.

Also, CircleCI provide using so-called orbs with its platform. Orbs are open-source, shareable packages of parametrizable reusable configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. You may involve orbs to reduce configuration complexity and help you integrate …</span>

I either end up over or under evaluating myself. This is due to who I think I am maybe completely different how other people actually perceive me to be.
I used a few different ways to identify my strengths and weaknesses. This consisted of:
Asking my peers and those around me: this helped me create a less self-serving bias list. I avoided asking people that I wasn’t too close with as they would give me vague and ‘nicer’ strengths and weaknesses. 
Taking an MBTI test: this helped me understand my personality better and how this can be reflected in my strengths and weaknesses

                    <span>When I started my first developer role about a year ago, I was both excited and worried. Excited to code on the job, and worried that they&#x27;d fire me when they found out that I didn&#x27;t actually know how to code. 
I had just written my first lines of JavaScript a couple months ago, and the knowledge gaps I had seemed infinite. It felt strange to call myself an Engineer when others who started with me clearly knew so much more than me. 
At first, I attributed these self-doubts and feelings of insecurity to my career change. After all, people&#x27;s professions often form an important part of their identity, and mine had just changed completely.

                    <span>If you need the data on your page fetched, cached, and beautifully paginated for an amazing user experience, you clicked on the right post. I implemented a solution to this problem a few days ago at work and wanted to share it with you:
I don&#x27;t want to bore you with a long section about setup and creating boilerplate, so I will just assume you are familiar with the basics. You can also inspect the finished project in this respository if you are left with questions. Let&#x27;s go:
You will need a fresh Next.js project with react query and material-ui installed. I opted for material-ui v4 because that&#x27;s what we have at work but feel free to use whatever version you want,

                    <span>写了两篇关于消费的文章，这次回归产品经理主业，聊聊个人管理。
做好个人管理和做好产品经理这两件事在我看来是相辅相成的。首先，我们身边的大部分人都是毕业就开始打工（甚至还没毕业已经在打工了），大部分的时间都花在了工作上，一方面是为了生存，通过劳动我们会获得报酬，另一方面也可以说是实现自我价值或者其他你觉得重要的点。总之我们的生活方式以及整个人都在不知不觉间被工作塑造了。
以我自己为例，产品经理这个岗位的其中一项职能是项目管理，虽然有的公司会细分出「项目经理」岗，但大部分中小型公司的产品都在兼任或曾经兼任过项目经理。所以在产品经理工作中，我逐渐养成了项目管理的思维模式：使项目能够在有限资源限定条件下，实现或超过设定的需求和期望的过程，而个人管理是我们每个人最独一无二的项目。

百度百科：在个人管理中，个体既是管理者，也是被管理者。

背景
一开始我的个人管理诉求源于我对现实生活的不满，毕业后我留在家乡工作，住在家里。因为无法随时所欲地生活，就十分想拥有自己的住所，然后我制定了一个 3 年买房计划。可当时的我不知道个人管理怎么做，更没有认清现实，只是内心有一个很想实现的目标，其他全凭感觉，每天的日子还是过得浑浑噩噩，不仅没有缩短跟目标之间的距离，还在走弯路。
工作中的管理实践
所幸我的工作是自己喜欢的，因为能接触到更多的信息，并不断学习新东西。我需要每天在工作前明确当前是项目的什么阶段，写下今天要完成什么任务，要跟谁沟通以及得到怎样的结果，然后在每天结束工作后记录当天任务的完成情况并复盘：是否存在风险？该如何安排明天的工作？——当然你也可以把这些简称为「日报」。除此以外，我还要去了解行业发展趋势和热点，国内外优秀互联网公司最近又推出了什么新 App、新功能等等，就需要有工具去整理并归纳这些资料以及尽量高效。
通过工作，我首先接触并掌握的个人管理内容是信息管理也可称为知识管理。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。
中山纪念堂
「城市漫步」（citywalk）通常会有一个领队带十多个人在城市中走一段固定路线，以此观察和了解城市的历史、建筑和文化景观，这种旅行方式在日本和欧洲国家比较流行。但国内目前只有上海有比较多团队组织城市漫步活动，但其实中国还有很多城市同样特别适合漫步，比如中山。
中山城区保留了许多老街老巷，历史丰富的老式民居藏匿于其中，路边是为行人遮阴的高高的行道树，城市中还有平靓正的美食，这些让中山成为一座十分适合行走的城市。而也我因为在中山生活而爱上了城市漫步，在中山生活的四年多时间里也走过许多的大大小小的街巷，喜欢上用行走的方式了解一座城市，去旅行的时候总是先往老城区的巷子里钻。于是我编辑了这篇文章来分享了自己在中山漫步经验，希望为大家认识城市提供一种新的视角。
俯瞰中山
一、以历史文化景观为中心的城市漫步
中国东南沿海地区的许多建筑都受民国时期南洋华侨带来的建筑风潮的影响，比如下面要提到的碉楼和骑楼，以及随处可见的各式民居。这些建筑在吸收外来建筑审美的同时又结合了当地传统的文化，并在建造中因地制宜的产生了多种多样的形态，每栋建筑都有自己独特的个性，成为中山街头独特的风景，而这些都是只有通过城市漫步的方式才能体验到。

民居
漫步路线：仁厚里、永安里、龙母庙街、拱辰路、水关街、下河泊、弓箭巷、华贵坊、从善坊
由于核心城区没有受到很大程度的开发，中山保留了大片的老住宅区，这些住宅区的交通网络交错纵横四通八达，许多历史悠久、形态各异的民居就扎根在这些街巷深处。中山现存的老民居不…</span>

                    <span>When someone says Apple Watch, the first thing that comes to the minds of a lot of people is fitness. And this makes total sense, considering Apple mostly markets the health features of the watch. However, there’s a lot more to this smartwatch than just tracking your activity, workouts, and the data revolving around them.

                    <span>大家好，我是《秦时明月》的执行制片人薛小明。首先还是对各位喜欢《秦时明月》的秦迷朋友表示感谢。《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》十五周年版，已经播出第三集，相信大家都看到了一段精彩的打戏，不知道看得过瘾不过瘾。相信大家从中也能看出，我们在这个版本上花费的心血。

对于这部作品的意义，正如沈导之前回答提过，这次的十五周年版是在《秦时明月》播出十五周年之际，答谢秦迷和观众朋友的一份回馈。为了更好的效果，这次《新秦时明月》的制作也有很多不易，除了用我们最新的技术提升了画面的质感和各方面的细节之外，我们还进一步提高了打戏的观感。对一部武侠作品来说，打戏毫无疑问是至关重要的。而与注重特效的影视作品不同，《秦时明月》一直是那种“拳拳到肉”的写实武学实践者，相信看完第3集的观众就更能够感受到这种风格。

这一集的打戏占比是比较高的，从前面无双与项家子弟的切磋，中间少羽和无双单挑，到最后危急关头盖聂的一剑救场，可以说既还原了我们第一部的经典剧情，又增加了很多亮点。在武戏上，我们着重表现人物的特色以及更真实的打击感、紧迫感。为此，我们加快了打戏的节奏并尽可能的展现出角色见招拆招的设计，比如少羽和无双的这段打戏，无双的特点是力量强又有着钢筋铁骨，一旦被他抓住就很难脱身反击，所以少羽更多是依靠身法的灵活躲闪去进攻他的薄弱部位。且不管是无双还是少羽，所做出来的很多组合动作以及运镜都是经过不断地调整，同时是连续镜头，这样可以看出人物的连贯动作。

为了这些效果，我们的武戏部会与我们的动捕演员深入交流，所以武戏这方面，我们确实是花了很多力气去做。我想这也是秦时明月传统武学的魅力之一。
在正片的最后，大家可能注意到这是一段在旧版《秦时明月》中没有出现过的镜头，即盖聂找到天明并保护他的这段回忆。这段回忆是我们对剧情细节的一个补充，也是为了让盖聂这个角色更立体。相信通过这些细节的补充，可以让观众对盖聂为什么会叛离秦王宫的原因有了更多自己的理解。

这一集中主要涉及到的点就是以上这些，后续的剧集中还会有更多精彩丰富的内容呈现，希望大家能够多多支持我们。在此也感谢粉丝和观众为我们提出的建议，之后我们一定会继续努力，为大家带来更好的作品。

                    <span>大家好，我从2006年进入游戏行业，长期从事开放世界游戏开发的美术及技术美术工作。对于游戏内容生产工具以及研发流程管线方面，我有着长期使用以及开发经验，直接参与过多个知名AAA游戏的研发，同时也支持其他研发团队的工作。来到天美技术中心后，我正在负责技术美术工具流程和技术方案的研发、推广落地以及技术支持。
近几年，开放世界游戏项目遍地开花，开放世界游戏的海量内容对数字内容设计和生产带来了两个大的挑战：一是内容制作量的大幅提升，二是内容品质提升，包括美术的高品质，丰富多样性、独特新颖性等要求。这两个挑战促使游戏从业者研究探索更多新的技术工具和工作流程来应对。
程序化生成是国内游戏制作方面的热门话题，还记得我曾参与制作一款海外大型开放世界游戏，当时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能比较简单，一个开放世界关卡美术可以制作和迭代一平方公里的关卡地图。
而两年后，我又参与了另一款开放世界游戏的制作，此时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能已经被迭代优化，一个关卡美术可以制作五平方公里的关卡地图。从中可以看出，先进的工具和流程，对提高数字内容生产效率的助力非常明显。
程序化生成通过在工具中设置一些程序化规则，去自动生成游戏内容，确实能在一定程度上提高制作效率。完善的工具和流程使得团队能够高效地制作出很多规模宏大且高品质的游戏内容，但是近些年，程序化生成工具和流程也逐渐显现出了一些限制和弊端。
首先，程序化生成的内容往往比较重复和单调。程序化生成通常由技术美术或者技术动画，通过观察归纳总结现实世界的现象效果，来制定生成规则，但是现实世界的丰富性和多样性会使得完全原样重现的规则过于复杂或者代价太高，所以在实际过程中，我们通常会简化规则，而简化规则以后，自动生成的效果就会丢失很多细节和变化。
举一个例子，在真实世界中，植被生长和分布的因素很多，例如降雨量、温度、湿度、经纬度、海拔、光照、风向、土壤环。而当我…</span>

                    <span>回答此问题前，我们可以先看看，其他传统形式是呈现科幻题材的好载体么？
郭帆的影视团队对中国科幻的工业化影视改编做了拓荒性质的探索，团队选取了刘慈欣《流浪地球》这篇2.2万字中篇的其中一段进行了改编。从电影工业化来看，它的置景、服化道和特效真正做到了对叙事的辅助和增强（甚至还在半途成立了UI部门来解决呈现问题），他们的努力使得电影的世界可信、幻想合理，作为当代科幻电影可以说是合格了，但不少观众会批判其人物和剧情过于套路，而另一些观众则认为其格局过小、背离原著精神。
《爱，死亡与机器人》是以动画短篇形式对科幻呈现的探索，第一季18集中的16集背后都有科幻小说原著支撑，包括广受好评的《齐马蓝》。不少观众喜欢其恢弘浪漫的视觉表达和返璞归真的禅意，但原著中作者阿拉斯泰尔·雷诺兹还有一层探讨，是关于记忆的载体，由肉体记录的不稳定记忆和由机器记录的精确记忆，究竟哪一个才是人之为人的关键。有些科幻读者与学者惋惜于这部分探讨被完全抹去，但也有影评人认为这一取舍令此作品封神。
对于最近刚刚上映的《沙丘》意见分化更是严重，路人观众对于一群掌握空间旅行技术的人用冷兵器打群架十分困惑，认为其节奏缓慢、剧情拖沓。但也不乏喜欢其美术风格者，和包括我在内的对其精准还原了原著风貌与精神的科幻爱好者。
而最近火热的“元宇宙”概念，最早来自尼尔·史蒂文森的《雪崩》，这一科幻概念的落地已不再局限于单一载体，而是涵盖了多样载体与技术的现实社会。当然，有人认为这是人类发展的未来，也有人认为这个概念被过度解读，变成了什么都能装的口袋概念。
除此之外，《诗云》的广播剧、《三体》的舞台剧、《闭环》改编的剧本杀《星落五丈原》、综艺节目《火星情报局》等，都是对科幻题材落地形式的探索，但孰优孰劣，相信每一个欣赏体验过的人都有不同的看法。
 


对于游戏载体，这些问题也同样存在。

                    <span>不知不觉在游戏开发行业已过十年，从刚入行的技术小白，到现在依然什么都不懂的技术搬砖工，见证了一个时代的游戏技术变革。我本人先后做过游戏开发SDK，端游MMO，休闲手游，重度手游，大世界手游，大世界端游等各品类产品，现在是天美F1工作室技术中台引擎程序团队负责人。
游戏行业发展很快，玩家对游戏的要求越来越高，游戏对技术的要求也越来越高，开发量也越来越大。我现在所在的天美F1工作室正在开发3A级全平台的大世界游戏，这是一件非常具有挑战的事情。
本人作为游戏引擎程序，深知技术更新之快，需要不断的学习才能接受这个挑战。所幸我们已经提前在多个方向积累了对标国际3A大厂的技术能力，并且还在全球招募了不少具有3A项目研发背景的各方面人才。通过不断的夯实技术基础，我们有能力也有信心接受新的挑战。在我们储备的技术中，PCG的技术是目前大世界游戏必不可少的一种技术，现在做一些简单介绍。
PCG（Procedural content generation过程化内容生成）技术是最近比较热的提升游戏生产效率的一类技术。它是什么意思呢？
网络百科给出的答案：过程生成（英语：procedural generation）是计算机科学中一种使计算机自动制造一类数据的算法。在计算机图形学中，它也被称为随机生成，常用于制作材质贴图和三维模型资源，并在电子游戏领域中用于自动制造大量游戏内容。过程化生成有着减小文件体积、扩大内容量、增强游戏随机性等优点。
我个人的理解：如果在游戏中应用，简单说，过程化内容生成就是利用算法来自动生成游戏内容。原有的游戏内容需要美术和策划花费大量的精力制作，过程化的方式可以大大降低人工成本，除了可以节省一些重复的人工劳动之外，甚至可以自动创作出一些新的设计内容。试想如果有一个程序可以自动生产游戏，那是多么有意思的一件事情，也许那天到来，游戏开发者都下岗了。

                    <span>作为社恐人士，看看我这小眼神就知道我是自愿回答的！


因为直到开播前都很兴奋，所以前几天都没怎么睡，思维到现在都还有点乱，就随便闲聊下吧。


我们跟腾讯动漫算是合作很久了，他们在我们大火鸟还没什么名气的时候就给了很多机会，加上这次能得到《大王饶命》这个项目，真的很感激也很开心。


我还记得当初ASK老师和我第一次说这个项目的时候，我就觉得这是我们团队的荣耀，而且碰巧ASK老师和肘子老师还有我三个都是白羊座,生日还刚好挨着，就觉得这缘分也太巧了。


说来有点不好意思，在还没见到本人前，我以为肘子老师是那种特别严肃的老人家，没想到碰面后反而有种一见如故的感觉。于是我就追着他问了很多关于小说创作的事，一番交流下来，我算是深刻地领会到了什么叫头部作者。


光是我们这几个小时的聊天就足够让我学到了很多平时压根不可能注意的故事创作细节，而且他最厉害的就是可以在极短的时间里想到一段非常有意思的梗，大王第一话开头的吕树怼糖葫芦师傅就是肘子老师几分钟内蹦出来的创意，真的是让人非常佩服。


话说回来，虽说能接到这个项目很让人兴奋，但兴奋劲过头随之而来的就是不安了。因为这部小说的知名度很高，加上肘子老师对我们的期待很高，所以我们必须拿出全部实力去完成它才行。


最终在燃尽了全部精力后，作品顺利上线了，从那刻起，我心里的不安也就渐渐消散了，真心希望大家能够喜欢上《大王饶命》的动画版。


说起动画版的亮点，这两天被大家热议的OP肯定是一个重头戏。实话实说，其实我并没有刻意去做什么布局之类的、与创作无关的事。我只是给了一群爱玩的朋友一个足够的空间，让大家可以在其中尽情玩耍，玩得开心。


我确实没想到会火到这个程度，毕竟我每次做OP/ED的初衷就是让创作者尽情表达自己的创作欲，我相信只有完全释放激情和灵感的作品才是好作品。这也是我为什么特别喜欢跟无念聊创作的事，因为每当我跟他聊起OP时，我能够感受到他眼里是有光的，这是他真心喜欢做的东西，就像他说在制作过程里并没有遇到什么太大的难题，反而更像是水到渠成。


至于正片内容，对我来说比较难的是如何让吕树的怼人场景比较贴合我们的现实世界，因为如果过度追求搞笑效果的话，很容易就会变成那种烂大街的搞笑喜剧。然而这部作品的内核并不是搞笑，所以我们最初开始制作的时候就定下了偏写实的方向，只有这样才能让吕树这个角色显得更加立体。在初期讨论时尤其让我最印象深刻的是ASK老师说“麻烦导演你把第一季做的穷一些，要那种从里到外的穷感。”


真是让人头大.jpg。


一部好剧肯定少不了好细节，我们现在每次要制作新作时，在正式开始前都会去相关地点进行场景、道具的取材，《大王饶命》也不例外，这次为了构建出吕树的房子，我们收集了相当多的资料，所以最后出来的场景美术设定所有人看了都很满意。比较可惜的是我们没能赶上庙会的时间，所以没能体会到原汁原味的庙会氛围，有点可惜。


除了吕树的房子外，像是比较重要的学校场景也在精心收集了很多资料后对它进行了高度的还原，尤其是道元班的设计，我是真的苦恼了很久，最终才定下了方案。而且因为疫情的缘故，在取材结束后我们就匆匆回到了广州，在那之后因为各种原因也没能再去一次，所以后面的很多场景就只能参考之前拍的照片，通过回忆和讨论尽可能地还原了。


最后，再次感谢腾讯动漫，谢谢肘子老师，给了我们这次参与《大王饶命》动画化项目的机会！

                    <span>写在开头
其实笔者本不想探讨关于《一人之下》中人战力高低的问题，因为这类问题往往会沦于骂战，但是看到题主的这个问法“十年空窗期打掉一众十年修为的”，笔者觉得有点意思。
就在此处做一个小小分析，希望各位读者在看待一人之下中的战斗时能够从更多方面去考虑，也算是抛砖引玉了。
先说结论——打架要靠脑子的
张楚岚到底有多强？并不强。
其实细细分析，张楚岚的各方面纸面战力其实都很一般，刨除个别本来就不擅长战斗的同龄人外(没觉醒双全手的吕良），甚至说可以比同龄人还略弱。
但是真正面对战斗时，还包含很多因素，比如战斗智商、心性果决程度、布局算计以及悟性。
而这些非纸面战力，都能够在具体的战斗中扭转乾坤，改变局面。

何谓纸面战力：
包括功法、修为年限、战斗经验、对各门各派功夫的熟悉程度以及肉体和灵魂的强韧程度。
那么张楚岚的纸面战力怎么样呢？
张楚岚现年19岁（虚岁），出生于1997年2月4日，由于并不知道张楚岚是几岁时候得炁开始修炼的，但是参考同龄的诸葛青7岁得炁开始修炼。张楚岚只能更早，假设是在5岁（2001年）。

张楚岚7岁时，张怀义过世（2004年甲申年）。他就停止了修炼，连静功都停止了，从而瞒过公司，一直以普通人的身份活到了19岁。


那么张楚岚的修炼总时长为：2001年-2004年期间，满打满算4年时间。

功法：
金光咒、雷法、老农功【相比其他门派的功法略强】
修为年限：
4年【同龄人10年起步】
战斗经验：
4-5次（罗天大醮期间）【同龄人大多有各门派切磋学习，经验远多于此】

对各门各派功夫的熟悉程度：
龙虎山本门（只教授了术法，没解释含义）、藏龙提供的少量其他门派情报【同龄人大多会有同门长辈传授经验典故】


肉体和灵魂的强韧程度：
由于并非训练肉体的横练或者是性命双修的全真龙门，张楚岚的肉身强度为一般水准，但是灵魂的坚韧强度在同龄人中是出类拔萃的。【同龄人被擤气攻…</span>

I Hate You

SZA

[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y&#x27;all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping &#x27;bout your whereabouts
I can&#x27;t keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don&#x27;t want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can&#x27;t shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin&#x27;
Heavy on the missin&#x27; you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain&#x27;t no findin&#x27; us
I&#x27;ve been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to makе me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just likе this?

[Verse 2]
Used to be too solid &#x27;til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent &#x27;til you ambushed me
Now I&#x27;m out here wildin&#x27; with you
Now I&#x27;m out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin&#x27; boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don&#x27;t ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin&#x27;
Heavy on the missin&#x27; you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I&#x27;ve been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain&#x27;t no findin&#x27; us
I&#x27;ve been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape &#x27;Life B4 Fame&#x27; with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.</span>

Continuing from our last post, I talked about how ANSI Game Engine is a colourful telnet server. We left off with needing to fork the engines telnet server.
Time to level up our telnet server and make it multi-player with some knify forky.

I&#x27;ve added in the strftime identifier from Perl&#x27;s POSIX module to help with time stamping the output. The setsid identifier is for starting a new session and group ID for each forked process. A.K.A, the child process. :sys_wait_h is for returning without wait after the child process has exited, using the WNOHANG flag when calling waitpid(). This provides non-blocking wait for all pending zombie children.

A machine learning (ML) model is only as good as its input data. In a world of inequity, developers must ensure they build responsible models void of bias.
Introduction
What is algorithmic bias?
Societal harm
Closing thoughts
As artificial intelligence (AI) begins to integrate itself into daily life, it’s essential that the technology be created for equitable and ethical use. Creating a responsible product is essential and failure to do so can have very real consequences. While neutral in theory, algorithms are at risk to become as biased as the world they were created from.
Algorithmic bias occurs when computers make systematically biased and unfair decisions based on the data they&#x27;re given. AI has the power to be a tool for the implementation of diversity and inclusion in many fac…</span>

It is quite a big announcement for performance engineers. Let us see whether Azure Load Testing fulfills our needs or not in this blog post.
What is Azure Load Testing?
As foretold, aptly put, Azure Load Testing is an offering for the customers who are in the Azure ecosystem. Even if you are not in Azure, you can still spin up the load test resource for performance testing. But the catch is, PRICING. We can discuss the pricing in another blog post. Let us focus on the features, how to get started and more.

                    <span>One of the advantages of using containers is the ability to have images with our environment pre configured and ready to go with our application code. These images is what allows us to run a container on our laptop and then run the same image on a container in the cloud. But building this images is not a trivial task, and we tend add useless tasks or overhead to the images we create. This entry is to share some of the best practices that has work for me in the past when building docker images.
First of all we need to define what a docker image is. A docker image is a unit of packaging that may includes Operating systems constructs or packages, application dependencies and libraries and application code.

Dan Pupius, CEO and co-founder of Range, joins us this week to discuss the need for better, more collaborative tools as work becomes increasingly team and project based. Dan believes software development was the vanguard to the 21st century work model: when a distinction between &#x27;normal&#x27; work and hybrid work will no longer exist because all work will be hybrid work.

                    <span>It was the first day in my last year of tech high school. The new programming teacher arrived and stood silent for a second, and then he started the lesson:
This year we will create a state machine with persistence using C++. This state machine will be a light-bulb that can be turned on, or off.
We all just look at each other thinking &quot;ok, that will be easy&quot;... and then he dropped the bomb:
There&#x27;s a catch: You&#x27;ll not be allowed to use if or for for it.
Now the class was clearly confused. Flow control is one of the first things we all learn as programmers. The main objective of that teacher was to teach us that we need to stop thinking conditions as if, repetitions as for, and so on, and instead be more abstract with the logic on our code. In JavaScript we have:

In this post, I present a recap of all the API launches and programs - from Twitter as well as the academic research community - that has made it easier for researchers to do research with Twitter data.
Launched in January 2021, the academic research product track is one of the biggest updates to the Twitter API v2 for the academic research community. It provides qualified academic researchers free access to the full-archive of public Tweets (previously, academics had to use the paid premium API to get Tweets older than 7 days). In addition to access to the full-archive search functionality, academics get 10 million Tweets …</span>

西班牙巴塞罗那的圣家堂大教堂，本周在尖塔顶端安装了一颗12角玻璃星，将在新年前夕被聚光灯照亮。这座建筑是联合国世界遗产，已经造了130多年，估计还要好几年才能土建完工。（via）
本周话题：低纬度，高海拔，气候优势
上个月，我在四川旅行。离开成都以后，一路向南，就到了攀枝花。
那是一个很奇特的地方，气候与周边截然不同。

从成都开始，就一直是阴天，但到了攀枝花，天天都是阳光明媚的大晴天。而且很暖和，当时已经是10月底，北方都下雪了，那里白天的最高气温却还在25度以上，可以穿短袖。
总之，天气好得让人怀疑。我就去查了，果然是有原因的，大家看下面这幅中国年平均气温图。

上图中，颜色越深，年平均气温越高（越热）。注意看，在成都和昆明之间，箭头所指的地方，有一块异常的深色区域，气温显著高于周边，比南边的昆明还要高，接近西双版纳的颜色（温度）了。那就是攀枝花。
为什么这里气温高？
书上的解释是，主要原因是独特的地理环境，这里是 &quot;低纬度、高海拔的盆地&quot;。纬度低，接近北回归线，所以冬天不冷；平均海拔1000米以上，所以夏天不热；
更主要的是，这里地处金沙江河谷，周围都是高山，空气不易流动，风比较小，所以比同纬度的地方更热。而且，高山挡住了水汽，所以很少下雨，晴天多。

（图片说明：旅馆窗口望出去的景象，城市被高山包围。）
这样的地理条件，使得冬天的气候非常舒服，暖洋洋的。当地政府现在把康养产业（养老）当作主要产业，一到冬天，大量外地人口涌入过冬。
仔细想一下，国内符合&quot;低纬度、高海拔&quot;这个条件的城市，没有几个的，可能都在云贵高原。这些城市都非常…</span>

引言
作为一部手腕上的计算设备，Apple Watch 能给我们的生活带来很多方便。遗憾的是，Apple Watch 本身的操作逻辑还有很大的改进空间。
例如，从初代 Apple Watch 一路用上来，我始终困惑于为什么操作手表始终需要用到两只手：你必须把佩戴手表的手腕端正抬着，用另一只手在表盘的方寸江山上指点。
即使是在双手空闲的情况下，这么操作也会显得窘迫，更不要提撑雨伞、提重物这种一只手被占据的情况了。（用鼻子或者下巴点过屏幕的读者请举手。）
这个问题终于在今年得到了解决——尽管是通过一种「曲线救国」的方式。在 watchOS 8 中，Apple 将多种新的「辅助功能」带到了 Apple Watch 上，其中就包括 iOS 用户熟悉的「辅助触控」。
在辅助触控的帮助下，用户可以用捏指、握拳等手势代替触控操作；换言之，用一只手就可以使用 Apple Watch 上的所有功能。
先来看看 Apple 的官方介绍视频：
 
是不是颇有些「呼风唤雨」的魔术色彩？
诚然，「辅助功能」的设计初衷是方便那些有肢体不便的用户，但这并不意味着普通用户不能从中受益；从某种意义上说，「一只手被占用」本身就是一种肢体不便的情形。本文中，我们就将介绍如何利用这一新增的辅助触控功能，单手掌控 Apple Watch。
注： 请注意「辅助触控」功能仅适用于 2020 年起推出的型号，即 Apple Watch Series 6 或以上，以及 Apple Watch SE。
开启手势和基本操作
启用 Apple Watch 的辅助触控功能其实只需简单几步。在 iPhone 上打开 Watch App，进入「辅助功能」&gt;「辅助触控」，然后打开「辅助触控」开关。接着，点击「手势」，再打开其中的「手势」开关。

我要从这片石之海获得自由！

@SHY：时间是 2011 年，舞台是美国佛罗里达州。空条徐伦在与恋人兜风途中遭遇交通事故，而后被律师与法官联手陷害，因谋杀罪获刑 15 年，押入别名「水族馆」的州立绿海豚街重警备监狱。束手无策之际，徐伦却从父亲空条承太郎托付的护身符中觉醒了不可思议的力量。然而，将家族秘辛和盘托出的承太郎，在营救徐伦越狱时因失去主角光环遭到敌人暗算，沦为失去替身和记忆的植…</span>

                    <span>作为不记账就会焦虑星人，我在使用 iPhone 时曾大力赞扬 MOZE 这款记账应用，不是因为 MOZE 有多强大或多完善，而是它具备了许多特别人性化、符合实际情况的功能细节。
在回归 Android 平台后，我一直在「吹毛求疵」般寻找记账应用。可无论是大厂知名产品还是无数来自独立开发者之手的优秀作品，使用起来它们都有地方会让我皱一下眉头——并非是不够强大（有的产品甚至可以用于资产管理），而是缺少了那些贴心细节。所以当我体验到小星记账时，那些细节让我产生了一种「平行时空里的我开发了这样一款记账应用」的错觉。
基础功能常规但足够好用
从应用本身来看，小星记账仍然是常规的记账工具，它将账目概览、账户信息、统计报表这三个核心功能分成三个页面展示，低频和进阶功能则收纳进了侧滑菜单，整个记账流程足够顺畅，账目类型、金额分类以及附属信息在一个屏幕中就可以完成，结合规范的 UI 设计，日常使用使用起来逻辑感很强。
不过有几个地方也能看出来小星记账有它自己的想法，比如它没有像大多数同类产品一样提供日历视图，以及它将四则运算收纳进了数字键盘的二级菜单中，记账老手们应该会比较不习惯，不过体验一段时间之后我发现，这两个功能似乎并没有我想象中那样常用。

记账是为了了解自己的消费习惯，所以定期查阅详单和报表非常重要。小星记账在报表方面的逻辑也非常明确：概览和图表一目了然、详单可以通过筛选查看。小星记账也提供了收支差额（可以看作结余）的计算，另外每类图表下方还会「一言以蔽之」简要概括这段时间的财务状况。详单部分也比较完善，对应大类、小类、账户或者不同时间段的结余详单都能查看到。最近一次更新后小星记账在搜索功能中新增了「高级筛选」，用户可以通过自定义时间、金额、分类、账户等等信息筛选对应账单，完全可以满足我们统计和对账的使用需求了。

除了常规功能，小星记账支持报销管理和周期事件，更新后也在记账页面提…</span>

                    <span>按：今天是 12 月 3 日，国际残疾人日。根据世界银行的数据，全球约 10 亿人患有某种形式的残疾。
诚如联合国在今年纪念活动的说明中指出，技术和创新越发促进着可访问性（accessibility）和可用性（usability）；辅助设备和辅助技术对于残疾人士发挥着关键的「促进平等」作用。其实，早在 2006 年，联合国通过、中国参与签署的《残疾人权利公约》就承认，获得辅助技术是一项人权。
在少数派，我们关注技术，也强调包容。在内容出品中，我们重视推广无障碍设计、介绍辅助工具的选题；与读者互动时，我们常常感动于那些虽然视听、行动不便，但依靠坚忍与才智活出别样精彩的故事。
值此残疾人日之际，我们特将网站中无障碍相关的优秀内容以合集形式呈现，希望为促进无障碍方面助人和自助的意识和技能，略尽绵薄之力。

一、无障碍技术综合讨论
怎样打造互联网「无障碍」

互联网为很多人打开了认识世界的另一扇门。对于残障人士来说，互联网不仅仅是丰富生活的方式，更是为了让他（她）们全身心投入到工作、生活、沟通、聆听、创作的桥梁。那么，为了实现这种互联网「无障碍」，厂商、社会组织都做了哪些努力？信息无障碍应当满足哪些标准？不同操作系统的无障碍设计和教程资源应该去哪查阅？本文一一为你解读。

我们为什么要关注包容性设计

包容性设计（inclusive design）是「一种能够充分利用并实现人类多样性的方法」。它包含无障碍设计，但又高于无障碍设计。世卫组织指出，残疾是一种个人属性，不仅仅只是健康问题，而还是一个环境问题，反映了身体特征与社会特征之间的相互作用。因此，每个人都可能在某种场景下成为「残疾人」。这篇译文从设计角度出发，探讨了包容性设计的实践方式，但对于任何用户都可以产生启发和触动。

《瞎玩菌的游戏周报》是我对游戏领域的观察和点评。具有以下特点：

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

游戏本身就是一种互动娱乐，我非常鼓励读者通过评论互动参与进来，而不是仅仅当个「读」者。

                    <span>For over a day now, the only laptop that I’ve been using is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 Reference Design. The only rule is that I can’t run benchmarks, so if that’s what you’re here to see, you won’t find them. I was OK with that though, because I’m really more interested in the experience.

奥密克戎至少有32处变异，而之前的德尔塔不过是2个变异。
但这里我需要澄清一个广泛存在的误解，所谓的32处变异指的是通过基因测序，但这并不代表奥密克戎的刺突蛋白的外形的变化一定就会大过德尔塔。

                    <span>（本文由天美同事帮忙翻译，相关配图在发布于个人主页和 Artstation 时已获育碧授权。）
大家好，我是坐标蒙特利尔的 Gilles Beloeil，是一名有近 20 年经验的美术从业者，如今在天美 F1 工作室担任概念美术专家。

蒙特利尔一直以 AAA 研发领域的人才密集和产业成熟而知名。过去数年，许多世界各地的游戏开发商来到蒙特利尔，在这里研发游戏，其中也有越来越多中国游戏公司的的身影。
对身处蒙特利尔的从业者来说，中国游戏公司在规模和投入上的准备程度是以往很少见到的。这种投入往往意味着可以打造极好的团队，而好的团队是好作品必不可少的。中国研发工作室的到来无疑为蒙特利尔注入了新鲜血液。

就我个人而言，决定加入天美是个天时地利人和的故事。此前，我在育碧蒙特利尔待了近 15 年的时间，有意尝试新的项目和环境。
天美蒙特利尔工作室的 AAA 项目恰好是我感兴趣的类型。深入交流后，我发现双方志趣相投，也都希望打造一部好作品。综合考虑下，我来到了天美蒙特利尔，这里的一切正处于启动阶段，充满挑战与活力，让我感觉非常兴奋。
目前，我负责为游戏设计概念图，探索游戏的美术风格和基调。由于仍在项目早期，所以人数尚少的概念美术团队可以充分发挥想象力，互相交流与克服困难，相互尊重专业，氛围非常融洽，我觉得这是个很好的开始。

AAA 游戏的概念设计
大家也许会好奇，AAA 游戏的概念美术设计过程是怎样的。其实并没有想象中复杂，我仅分享自己的一些个人经验。
概念美术设计的第一步，往往是从美术总监处，得到关于设计需求的简报。我会根据这份简报，去尽可能提出问题，理解对方想要的画面。在这之后，我会去寻找各种参考素材，主要用于以下层面：设计，氛围，配色，光影，构图，灵感 …… 进而我要决定用什么路径方法。

而路径方法的选择，取决于概念图的类型和目的：是用来展现氛围，还是具体设计？是游戏故事中的…</span>

                    <span>大家好，又是我。
我是《大王饶命》的动画监制askask，感谢大家对这部动画的关注，希望大家喜欢这部动画。
关于原作
 我在知乎也混了挺长时间了，感觉知乎的网文用户还是挺多的，所以第一个问题就先来说说原作吧。
其实我并不能算是一个传统的网文读者，除了很多年前追过一阵子紫川这种极早期作品之外，中间一直都没有关注过网文作品，《大王饶命》这本书老实讲也是因为工作相关才开始看的，但没想到一看就喜欢上了。那已经是几年前的事了，其实因为这本书我才去下载了起点app，然后这几年开始越来越关注新的网文作品，也追更了很多新的好书。
熟悉我的朋友可能知道我是一个极老极老的“老二次元”了（可能是很多人阿姨辈的那种），这本书给我的第一印象就是非常适合“二次元”方向的改编，不管是人设、剧情、战斗体系的设定等各方面。熟悉国漫的朋友应该知道我们现在的动画改编还是有很大比例是倾向于使用3D制作的，但《大王饶命》这本书我是看完之后马上确定了使用2D制作，并且很快敲定了现在的动画制作团队，简直是太合适了。
在制作中原作的改编其实有两个比较大的难点：一是搞笑，二是战斗戏。关于搞笑的问题上其实我们纠结了很久，可能更多的原著粉在看书的时候脑补出来吕树的怼人和比较贱的态度是会比较直接和更有冲击力的那种，但从人物的长线塑造和剧情角度考虑，我们还是处理成了现在的风格，前期PV放出的时候也注意到有些原作粉感到有些意外，但相信慢慢看下去，大家会逐渐理解我们的用意！而战斗戏份则是我们这一季重点打造的部分，尤其在后半进入遗迹之后，会有大量非常大规模的精彩战斗场面，为了这部分的制作导演已经跳楼几次被人民群众抬了回来（不是），最终还是让原作者替他摔断了腿（纯属胡扯）。没有啦，不过头发掉了大概有几车应该是真的。

关于OPED

                    <span>从07年初到现在，已经快15年了。还在这一行。就从我自身的经历说说行业这些年的变化，以及未来的趋势吧。
第一份工作是在完美世界，进去的时候公司还叫完美时空。那时候全国比较知名的游戏公司是盛大、九城之类的代理公司，大型的游戏开发公司还是很少的。完美时空那时也只有200多人，上线的项目只有完美世界、武林外传、诛仙。直到我入职半年后公司才在纳斯达克上市，随后迅速扩张起来。
那个时期可以说是3D端游刚刚在国内兴起，只要有技术能做出画面不错而且网络稳定的3dMMO，市场基本是随意收割的状态。完美当时采用的快速复制新产品抢占市场的方式，虽然被诟病为完美七胞胎，但确实是最适合当时国内游戏市场的打法。

当然，好日子没几年就开始变了，入局MMO的公司越来越多，一次重要的转变是史玉柱的征途登场，买卖数值的模式越来越成为网游的收入重心，自动寻路等小白的操作和刺激玩家PK也渐渐取代了探索大世界的游戏内容为主的设计方式。

另一个则是完美的老对头畅游的崛起，天龙八部的活动玩法和卖宝石等也迅速成为跟风对象。这两家京城游戏公司互相挖角也堪称一乐，双方的核心骨干基本都对着换了N次家。
这个阶段大概持续了五六年左右，在业内的体验基本是MMO游戏的画面技术在提高，但设计整体在下沉化和氪金化。对那些怀着初衷要做暴雪式游戏的国内开发者来说，大多会感觉日子越来越不好过和行业世风日下。然而谁能想到再过几年真的暴雪也要黄了呢。
但是随着竞争的激烈，因为大家都做了活动、卖数值，pk，社交这些容易模仿的下沉设计，这些设计也很快失去了异军突起的效果，于是大厂也出现了一股下血本提高品质的浪潮，不再急于推出项目，而是反复打磨游戏内的画面、战斗、副本等内容，以靠近国际水平。这时候有代表的作品比如腾讯的斗战神，西山居的剑3，网易的天下，完美的笑傲江湖等。如果按这个趋势发展下去，中国的端游确实是有可能走向国际3A的道路。

                    <span>先说结论吧，在射击游戏的领域，游戏策划的门槛确实在逐渐提高。工作以来我一直在从事射击游戏的设计，快8年了，我自己也是FPS游戏的重度爱好者，能把爱好与工作完美的结合也是一件幸运和开心的事儿。那么就从射击游戏领域的游戏策划工作，聊一聊这些年面临的一些挑战吧。

射击游戏一直是游戏的一大分支，从TGA近5年的获奖者来看，包含射击元素的游戏几乎占据了半壁江山，‘枪车球’的地位显而易见。并且每隔1-2年，都会有突破性的射击游戏产品诞生，TitanFall、OW、PUBG、2077等无一不给玩家带来相当程度的震撼。而像COD/BF这类超高质量的年货产品，更是牢牢占据领先的位置。射击品类可谓百花齐放。
 


而作为一个非常成熟的品类，在全球研发领域，射击游戏已经有了近30年的研发历史，无论在设计理论、技术成熟度和生产管线上，都已经有非常惊人的积累。国内的射击游戏研发真正爆发，也大约是从BR（BattleRoyal）时代开始，越来越多的工作室投入了射击品类的研发，而国内最早一批自研射击游戏的项目，可以追溯到2008年大连金山团队的反恐行动，到逆战迎来了更大的影响力，紧接而来的手游时代将竞争战场转向了移动端。

短短不到10年，国内的厂商通过努力似乎来到了弯道超车的拐点，但在移动端的超越更多是来自“端转手”的红利，随着越来越多的端游在移动端移植完毕，真正考验作游戏设计者的创造能力/设计能力的时代慢慢来临，能够脱颖而出的产品越来越难，尤其是在全球化市场的竞争中，新的手游甚至要以端游的品质或体验为目标，才能在这个时代获得成功。

天美J3工作室在移动端做出了《使命召唤手游》《穿越火线手游》这样的射击游戏作品，在玩家和市场上都取得了不错的成绩，一群热爱射击游戏的人一直在这个方向积累深耕。
随着射击品类的快速进化和走向全球游戏市场，我们也在布局新的产品方向，在开放世界、写实大战场和风格化游戏等领…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是 Steven Rhee，韩国人，是一名坐标北美的灯光美术（lighting artist）。个人曾在 EA 和动视等公司任职，积累了 15 年的游戏光照设计经验，目前加入天美洛杉矶工作室，从事 AAA 项目研发。我不懂中文，所以请天美同事帮忙翻译，给大家分享一些我的看法。
大家也许已经注意到，中国游戏厂商正在全球各地成立工作室，招募当地的 AAA 人才。在我看来，这本质是研发全球化的必然趋势，而且西方早就开始了。
过去十年，游戏已成为当前科技领域最关键，最具创新能力的行业之一，为全球近 20 亿人提供了极具沉浸感与惊艳感的娱乐形式，也让“娱乐产业（entertainment industry）”这个词不再限于指代好莱坞和电影。
随之而来的是，游戏研发的规模在不断扩大，尤其是对 AAA 级游戏而言，幕后成员往往超过上千人，需要多个工作室合作开发，才可能将游戏在规划期限内完成。早在许多年前，Rockstar Games、EA、育碧等厂商就已经开始在本土之外布局研发团队了。

经过长时间的积累，不管是从中国市场还是全球市场看，中国游戏研发进展迅速。面向全球市场，中国游戏行业自然向着 AAA 游戏研发领域扩张。游戏公司也在通过全球化研发布局的方式扩充人才池，提升团队多元化程度，来建立自己的竞争优势。
在个人层面，我认为研发人才加入新的开发环境是件很正常的事情，特别是受到资源、能力、决心的吸引。比如我，在跟天美接触中没有过多犹豫，我觉得加入天美会极大地帮助我个人的成长。
全球协作研发和团队多元化

                    <span>我从事游戏行业17年，先后任职于上海育碧和蒙特利尔育碧, 从PS2，Xbox时代的游戏开始，经历了PS3，PS4，Xbox 360，Xbox one等的变迁，也参与过多部当时所谓的“次世代”作品，比如《幽灵行动》，《I am alive》，《细胞分裂》和《孤岛惊魂》系列等等。做过关卡，VFX/shader TA，技术美术总监，期间负责过多个项目重大对外节点（如E3，gamescom等）的攻坚。
接触天美J3还是2019年的时候，当时美术总监 @BrianTao 和技术总监 @Shadow 找到我，给我展示了目前在研的几款游戏，我为手机上能呈现如此的品质而惊叹！
要知道出国前我对手游的印象还停留在《愤怒的小鸟》和《部落冲突》这类休闲品类上。之后我们又谈到了工作室今后的规划和发展，“大世界”，“工业化”是提到最多的关键词，这也正是与我过往的经验和想做的事不谋而合！
由于疫情关系，我最终在2020年底回国，有幸加入了天美J3大家庭，目前担任技术美术负责人。
说到工业化，虽然我经历过多款AAA“次世代”，但是从游戏的内容量品质，团队人员配置和流程上讲，它们同样有着天壤之别。行业也已经在过去这段时间里经历了几次重大革新。  记得早些年，在主机上（如PS2，Xbox）开发第一人称射击游戏，团队规模往往在百人以内，开发周期在1年左右。开发流程上也非常线性和简洁明了，比如游戏分为多个关卡，每个关卡由各自的关卡设计和关卡美术负责，在技术美术总监的指导下，效果得到艺术总监认可，性能在规定范围内就可以了。
至于里面的细节，只要不是违背大的技术框架，可以由该关卡的负责人按照自己的习惯就行，而资产（source data/raw data）管理，流程管理等也并没有规定得那么死板。在开发中遇到的问题，可以通过非常灵活的定向研发的方法逐一攻破。

                    <span>很多年前我在知乎给过一个论述，今天再稍微做一次复读机：
工业水平决定爆款上限
受众特质决定爆款呈现
囿于写这个论述的时候，我对于游戏产业的工业化其实理解是有一定偏差的。所以今天我对这个论述稍微修正一下：
在创意行业中，工业水准决定表达形态。
当然还是要说明，我自己并非游戏开发，本职工作现在更接近发行；很多涉及开发本身的事情我的回答会显得班门弄斧，请大家多多指正。
-
如何定义工业化？
我的定义就是在项目上建立高效的自动化系统，拥有成熟的开发技术栈，优化的开发工具，并利用成熟的系统高效地生产游戏内容。
工业化其实更多是生产方式的区别，重点在于效率的提升，而并非是产出的游戏本身的大区别。——在这个意义上来说，某些大作其实并非工业化生产，或者最多是纺织工人用上了珍妮纺织机，但离真正意义上的工业化生产，还有很多距离。
回归到问题“如何看待工业化对游戏产业发展的重要意义？“本身，在这个回答中，我想谈三个事情。
其一，是产能的提升。
产能其实是两个维度，第一是能做什么，第二是同样的时间能做多少。
实际上是存在一个反-工业化的叙事的。那就是“小作坊”生产。而大家都在鼓吹工业化生产，或者至少认为工业化生产是一个好东西的时候，我们面临的现状是大多数的游戏开发都以小作坊式生产为主。
这个倒不是说大家条件艰苦云云，而是说开发模式还是以堆人力，怼资源的模式为主。
在这种情况下，决定产品上下限的，都是团队整体每一个人的能力。在这种情况下来说，人员的稳定性和能力水平就非常致命。
同时，团队能力的下限也在非常大的程度上决定了你能做什么样的东西。
而开发的工业化在一定程度上是能够解决这个问题的，成熟的开发管线可以让内容的生产效率更高，也让内容生产更不依赖于某个/些特定人才。
这点在于游戏产品质量需求提升明显的今天，是尤其重要的：尽快完成开发工业化的厂商/工作室，一方面能够更快的追随市场的喜好，生产表现力更强的游戏产品；另一方面则显然能够有更大的腾挪空间，对市场的适应性更高。
其二，是管理模式的改变。
工业化的生产，势必引领更工业化的管理模式。这点在逻辑上还是很明显的。产能提升其实能够显著避免micro-management。项目管理的重要性也越来越多。
倒不是说某一种或者某几种项目管理模式就一定行。但以往关键角色一言堂的情况，在更高的产能下，其实会有一定的衰减——因为在高产能的环境下，leverage资源比对项目直接bb要更紧迫。
囿于我本身并非管理者，所以我对于这点的诠释并不全面。但我能够清楚且欣喜地看到，工业化能够带来的是更先进，也更能发挥每个人能力的管理模式。
其三，则是成本以及行业场景的远期变化。
有群友回答说，未来的游戏行业会有明显的两极分化现象。这点我非常同意——但是原因跟工业化的生产方式其实关系不大。更多的原因在于需求的变化：即使是在F2P领域，玩家亦需要表现力更佳的“大”游戏。
诚然，对于多数厂商来说，将自己舒适区内的开发模式更替为更工业化的开发模式，确实会有段时间的成本上升以及转型的阵痛。但长期来看，工业化的产能是能够在一定程度上降低成本的。
君不见EA，Ubi等等海外开发商，即使在海外他们的人力成本已经跟国内持平甚至更低了。但单纯从开发能力来看，国内还没有哪家公司敢说他们比海外厂商强的。
更近一步讲。即使对于个人/独立开发者来说，工业化体系下催生的产品，也会对他们的开发提供便利——君不见，Unity的普及让我们其实前所未有地容易开始做游戏了（当然真不真的去做又是另一回事）。
这最终导致的是游戏开发的商业电影-艺术电影分化，不肯找到自己真实地位的厂家被大浪淘沙。

                    <span>感谢邀请。确实，从目前趋势看，国内各大游戏厂商和工作室都陆续在海外布局，在海外设立自研工作室并大力引进海外高端人才。海外工作室的建立，可以一定程度上进行产能扩容，减轻游戏内容的研发压力。
更重要的是，海外一线专家的加入，可以带来老牌游戏开发商在高品质内容生产上的方案和经验，对于快速完成生产管线改造和核心研发能力升级上有比较大的参考意义。对于国内游戏厂商来说，加入全球化研发无疑是加速团队成长与探索AAA生产模式的机遇。
但挑战总是与机遇并存，全球化研发的趋势对游戏研发团队和个人，都会带来更多新的要求。不论是国内的游戏工作室，还是海外游戏厂商，目标都是建立“快速量产AAA品质游戏内容”的能力。只是各自的原始积累不一样，努力的方向也不尽相同。
对于我们来说，想在游戏研发全球化的大趋下守住优势并脱颖而出，不论在技术与工具的积累和探索上，还是在生产模式的摸索和迭代上，都应该以兼容并包的心态，吸收国内外的先进经验，快速建立自己的产研优势。
我们工作室在技术革新和前沿探索上一直比较积极，我自己也经历过数次大规模的技术升级和管线改造，目前也在负责新项目的技术迭代的规划和落地，可以分享一下我们在这个过程中的想法和经验，希望能提供给大家作个参考。
准备一：搭建工业化管线 — 流程标准化与生产自动化
随着玩家对高品质游戏内容量的需求增长，未来精品游戏项目的研发必然需要超大规模团队的承载和支撑，也呈现着跨地区多团队配合的趋势。这也正是全球化研发的本质。
跟单一团队生产不一样，跨地区多团队的联合研发，对于生产流程标准化的要求会非常高，以避免低效沟通带来生产成本的极大代价。
海外厂商在多地团队联合研发上有其经验和优势，值得我们借鉴和学习。 同时在游戏内容生产方面，自动化生成代替纯人工生产也将成为大趋势，通过程序化的方式可以大幅减少在内容生产上的人力成本，并提高整个项目的研发效率，以适应市场的快速变化。…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计专家Inkling，年轻人都喜欢叫我in老师。我从剑3开始职业生涯，在腾讯J3参与过逆战和穿越火线手游，可以说，国内原创科幻游戏的星星之火正是由我们这拨人点燃的。
我从小喜欢画画，更是个资深游戏玩家，从04年走出校园踏足游戏圈到现在，见证过国产游戏辉煌的成功，投身过行业中激烈竞争的战场......既然说到游戏美术的竞争力，我有些简单的想法想和大家分享。

这个问题之前，我觉得先需要回答下什么是游戏美术，什么是美术。如果一说到游戏美术，大家只能想到引擎和渲染的话，那这个行业未免有点无趣。
美术是一个大概念，游戏美术和其它几千年传统行业的美术，没什么本质区别。
做的都是让 —— 大到世界，小到物件 —— 的外表“好看”的工作。
让东西变好看的能力，每个人都有吗？如果我有这样的能力，怎么才能比别人更强？
我觉得可以从三个方面去说：执行，判断，观点。美术的竞争力就是提高自己这三个方面的优势，游戏美术也一样。

执行
执行就是实际美术工作的熟练度，执行力就是控制的能力。控制的能力就是让元素出现在它们该出现的地方，能够让色彩不乱，线条漂亮。疏密关系、明暗对比，这些已经是老生常谈，真正落到实处的时候，就是经验和练习量。
基础的战斗力，没有太多大道理可讲，选择行业需求的方向，尽最大可能花费时间锻炼。不管是软件技能还是绘画技法。所谓一万小时定律，说的就是机械的能力，而机械的能力就是靠机械的时间积累获得的。
实际执行能力的竞争，无非就是投入时间的赛跑，同样资质的人，多投入时间的一方一定会胜利。资质不好怎么办？那就投入更多时间试试。同时也要注意，专注在一件事上是对的，但是也需要留意其它领域，一专多能 vs. 一专，永远有优势。

判断
判断就是能知道什么是好看的，什么是不好看的，有审美。这个已经超越了美术范畴，审美和一个人的知识储备和阅读量密切相关。

                    <span>我是在传统老牌的西方 AAA 公司工作 15 年后加入中国游戏研发工作室的，我结合自己的观察和体验，尝试回答这个问题。
近几年，中国的游戏公司有很大的变化，逐渐向重视原创、追求更高品质、打造具有中国文化特色的游戏产品转变。最近经常听到这样一句话“中国游戏玩家的口味越来越高，国内的游戏公司也开始卷起来了。”
“卷”这个词用在这样的语境下，我认为不是件坏事，它代表着随着市场需求的变化，中国的游戏厂商对于品质的重视程度变得越来越高。
国外的 AAA 厂商已经这样“卷”了十几年了：游戏的画面越来越接近影视化，内容丰富度和体量越来越高，争相进行技术上的探索和突破，同时创新的作品也层出不穷。我很高兴看到中国的游戏公司也以这样的方式“卷”起来，让中国的游戏产品在各个维度上与国外的 AAA 大作掰一掰手腕。

我相信这样的转变，对于许多海内外从事 AAA 游戏开发的人才选择加入中国游戏公司，是一个至关重要的前提。 
AAA 游戏的开发是一个先慢后快的过程。一个非常有经验的 AAA 游戏团队，也可能要花费 1-2 年的时间来完成概念和创意方面的探索，2-3 年左右的时间进行试生产（Pre-production），这里主要包括设计方面的验证和技术管线的搭建。
所以，经常会出现游戏开发了 4、5 年，看起来却只有一个垂直切片以及一大堆白盒和临时资源的情况。但接下来会是神奇的一段时间，通常 80% 的游戏内容，都是在最后的 1 年到 1 年半时间里完成的。
这种“神奇”有一个前提条件，就是整个团队可以沉下心来，完成前面提到的创意设计和试生产环节，否则最后的全面投产（Full-production）将会是一场灾难。
每一部 AAA 游戏的开发都是一趟漫长的旅程，耐心，信心和决心三样缺一不可。而我已经在国内的游戏厂商中看到了这三样东西，所以我回来了。

                    <span>游戏是我从一而“衷”的选择。我大学毕业就一头扎进了游戏行业，从业至今，由一名普通设计师成长为主美，大约16年多点。这份选择从最初到如今或是将来，都不会变，所以在这里，我用了衷于初心的“衷”而不是终点的“终”。
游戏和动漫是我的两大爱好。与很多80后一样，在成长的时光里，我都是在棚里看别人玩《魂斗罗》，或是在街机厅打《街霸》中度过的。记得在作文作业里，我还写过一篇从8位机开始一路到当时的SFC 32位机的游戏主机发展史这种让老师一脸懵逼的作文。所以，我自认为一直是一名游戏爱好者。但可能喜好更偏向于动作，冒险且有剧情的游戏类型。
与此同时，我对动漫的热情也从未减少。因此在读书阶段，自己的休息和考试奖励基本都是被允许画漫画和游戏里的角色。后来，我有了让中国动漫形象席卷全球的愿望。这个愿望或许有些太大了，但自己始终在期盼这一天的到来。
大学毕业答辩时，我的论文题目是《如何推广中国卡通形象》。当时我感觉国内在这块的整个产业链还不完善，想要从动漫衍生出高认知，高流传度的形象或是文化理念会比较缓慢。所以在论文里，我是把游戏这样一个商业化相对成熟的产品放在第一推广位，然后再同步动漫周边等。这也是为什么我会直接选择游戏行业而不是其他行业。
入行后，我在第一家公司做的是手游，现在自己仍在开发手机游戏，感觉有些事情可能确实讲究点机缘。加入腾讯之前，除手游外，我还参与过PC和各类掌机，以及08到11年期间所有主流主机游戏的开发。但始终我都在做欧美向的设计。
直到进了腾讯，我才真正开始参与到国人自己的游戏研发中去。然而在刚开始的时候，我参与的项目在美术风格上依旧是偏欧美的。
直到2012年末，我在天美开始参与第一批风格全民化的微信游戏开发。从那时起，通过一个又一个的项目，我才逐渐将自己的美术风格往亚洲审美上靠。
最终在17年8月，我们研发的国风战争策略手游——《乱世王者》顺利上线了。（以下简称《乱世…</span>

                    <span>Old or new to the crypto world, you have probably already met with some cryptocurrencies. But how about creating one? That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do in this tutorial.
First, what is ERC-20? Some kind of android? No! Besides the difficult name, it is just a protocol to define what basic structure, rules and functionalities your fungible token (like crypto currencies) must have to properly interact with the world. But good news! You don&#x27;t have to write it from scratch, because OpenZeppelin already has a bunch of secure boilerplate smart contracts written and audited by the community developers, so you just have to import it in your code and extend your contract so it inherits the ERC-20 basic properties and methods.
To properly interact with the world your token needs some basic rules, such a…</span>

                    <span>After solving a Advent of Code challenge by treating the input as a program last year, I wanted more this year. The opportunity came today and I decided to take it. Instead of Parlet and Ruby, though, I decided to use Elixir/Erlang tooling to get the job done.
In the Day 2 this year you need to pilot your submarine. This is done by a series of commands, such as this:
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2

We have a command, followed by a number - one pair per line. There are three commands:
forward moves the submarine horizontally by number


down moves it down, increasing the depth we&#x27;re at
up does exactly the opposite of down



A series of commands - that&#x27;s a program! To execute it, we need basically 3 things: a lexer, a parser and an interpreter. Fortunately, Elixir gives us…</span>

                    <span>Using Lottie animations is an easy and popular way to add animations to your app to have that modern look and feel. All sorts of companies use Lottie animations, from startups all the way to the big boys, such as Google, Microsoft, Spotify, and Netflix to name the few.
Using LottieFiles you have a choice to make your own animations using Lottie Editor, buying animations from creators on Lottie Marketplace or using Free Animations to get LottieFile(s) completely free of charge to add them into you project.
Unfortunately, Lottie animations cannot be added directly to SwiftUI view without some work prior to that. In order to add Lottie animation to SwiftUI, you need to implement UIViewRepresentable protocol which is a wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate Lottie view into your Sw…</span>

In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to set up tailwind css easy peasy, without having to dig too much through the internet. We&#x27;ll start from making sure you have node installed in your computer, easy/awesome terminal tricks, right down to making sure you are set to start using tailwind in your code.
Side note: You do not need any knowledge of node to use tailwind. We&#x27;ll just use it for necessary installations.
To check if you already have node installed, then run the following command in your terminal.
node -v
If node was previously installed, then it should display the current version after you hit enter. If it wasn&#x27;t, then you&#x27;ll have to install node. You can get…</span>

                    <span>Optimising code for high performance can be exhausting; where can you squeeze that last bit of speed out of your code? How can you be faster than that one piece of code you found online?
For that, let&#x27;s take a look at the following example of our Rust crate:
pub fn new(values: &amp;Vec) -&gt; MathVector {
    let mut len: f64 &#x3D; 0;
    for i in values {
        len +&#x3D; i * i;
    }
    MathVector { values:    values.clone(),
                 dimension: values.len(),
                 length:    len.sqrt() }
}

Among other things - like the for loop for example - one thing is the problem. Can you spot it? The answer is: len.sqrt(). Getting the square root of a number is performance-wise extremely expensive - how should we get rid of it? You might guess, that we could implement something like the…</span>

                    <span>Since starting as a full time SWE, I&#x27;ve found myself using multiple note-taking apps:
Notion. Mostly use for meeting notes. I love the organization and search features. I love that you can add attendees and other properties. But the tablet app is painful to use with a stylus. And because it&#x27;s so structured, I&#x27;m less likely to add notes that don&#x27;t fit in a predefined section.
Samsung Notes. For daily tasks and reminders. This replaced the Cambridge Quad notebooks I used to buy in bulk. I bought a Samsung tablet, and now I&#x27;m stuck. The handwriting recognition is the best of multiple apps I&#x27;ve tried. Unfortunately the people at Samsung make it impossible to access and edit your notes on desktop or the web.
OneNote. Which I&#x27;ve been trying to use because it&#x27;s there and easy to save random screenshots to. But the lack of basic editing features and plugins sucks. The forced notebook and page structure is also pretty limiting. I hate clicking around to find notes and the view easily feels cluttered.
Random sticky notes. For random thoughts, customer service case numbers, git commands to refer back to, etc.
I would love to use one app that does everything these 4 apps do:
Organize my notes into groups and structures that I can easily search and get back to
Be workable on tablet. I&#x27;m not asking for much here. Just let me take notes. Recognize my handwriting and let me edit on desktop or the web.
Simple interface that doesn&#x27;t inhibit random notes or reminders I want to jot down.
Someone suggested Obsidian. Never used it before, but would love to get some feedback from those who have. If there&#x27;s another app that you swear, please let me know!

It allows you to communicate with users by directing their attention to the navigation bar and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for announcing business news, showing off the best features, generating leads, and so on.

Adolfo Neto: Do ​​you particularly prefer statically typed or dynamically typed languages ? If it were just for taste, not for saying what&#x27;s better or worse for developers.
José Valim: Dynamically typed. I agree a lot with the response from the creators of Erlang. When someone asks &quot;why isn&#x27;t Erlang statically typed?&quot;, a lot of people say it is &quot;because the theory for statically typing ever…</span>

@南鱼祭酒：realme Book 海岛灰
买这种手机厂商推出的首款笔记本电脑，是需要一定的勇气的。对于我来说，做勇士，其实是一个明确自己需求的必然结果。

购买渠道：realme 京东自营旗舰店
入手价格：4399（原价 4699）
下单及签收日期：10 月 27 日下定金，31 日付尾款，11 月 1 日发货，3 日收到

我一直有台式 Windows 电脑兜底，所以在笔记本方面只需要考虑轻薄即可。上一台 win 本是 vaio z，在 19 年底的时候 C 面有一点点鼓，就送回京东返修了（京东自营，我作为京东 plus，不修白不修），结果京东表示修不好，可以按购入价八折赔付给我，然后机器销毁。用了一年半的笔记本能有这样一个结果，对于消费者来说显然很值了。于是在之后的一年时间里，我的移动设备就变成了一台华硕的 Chromebook 和 iPad Air 第三代。这样的组合在家里当然无所谓，但是一旦要出门，一旦要出门而且要跟他人进行文件交换，Chromebook 和 iPad 的不足就体现出来了。恰逢苹果推出了全新的 M1，于是我在 20 年年底斥巨资购入了一台 MacBook Air M1 16+512（官网 24 期分期免息，四舍五入不要钱……）。
但是，在接下来的将近一年时间里，我发现 MacBook 并不适合我。

最值得称道的高性能 M1，我用不上。笔记本在我这里主要作用就是文档编辑器 + 浏览器，M1 杀鸡用牛刀了。
高续航我用不上，甚至轻薄我也用不上。我在今年（21 年）4…</span>

                    <span>12 月 2 日，App Store 正式公布 2021 年度 App 奖项。与去年一样，今年的 App Store 年度 App 奖项分为「年度 App」「年度游戏」「年度趋势」3 个部分；不同的是，今年的年度 App 奖项由过去的「App Store Best of」正式更名为「App Store Awards」。
在 App Store Awards 2021 奖项名单中，每个部分各有 5 款 App 获奖，获奖的开发团队同样会收到一块由 Apple 设计和制作的实物荣誉奖牌，奖牌背面会刻上获奖者的名字；奖牌由 100% 可回收再生铝合金制造，设计灵感来源于 App Store 的蓝色图标。

注：以下 App 仅标注 Apple 生态支持平台，部分应用和游戏还支持更多平台，你可以自行前往 App 官网进行了解。
年度 App
在年度 App 奖项中，我们能够看到许多少数派读者的「老朋友」，比如之前多次介绍过的笔记工具 Craft 以及天气应用 CARROT Weather 等等。
年度 Mac app：Craft

App Store

以精致设计和动效著称的新兴笔记工具 Craft，在推出的一年多时间里获得了 App Store 与国内外媒体的多次推荐，也是 少数派评选出的 2020 年度 App，也在今年获得了 Apple Design Awards「交互」主题奖项提名。

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

                    <span>如果是 Steam 忠实老粉，那么 Wallpaper Engine 你应该也不陌生。这款 Windows 的动态壁纸软件，可谓是把 Windows 桌面和 Steam 社区强大的生产力结合在了一起 —— 桌面壁纸动起来了，似乎也给 Windows 增加了一份动感。不然，每天盯着死气沉沉的 Windows 方格视窗，也真的是有些腻。
不过如今，Wallpaper Engine 也登陆 Android 了。
熟悉的配方，熟悉的味道
在 Android 设备上，Wallpaper Engine 默认仍然保留了几个经典的壁纸，比如「Fantastic Car」「Razer Vortex」和「Neon Sunset」。这些壁纸也都为移动设备的屏幕大小做了优化，同时可以在应用内一键设置为锁屏或者主屏幕壁纸。难能可贵的是，桌面版对于壁纸本身极高的自定义程度也在 Android 版本中得到了保留：以 Neon Sunset 为例，用户可以自定义各种颜色、比例以及播放速度，自定义程度完全不输 PC。
除此之外，移动端 Wallpaper Engine 支持「对运动作出反应」—— 你可以选择让壁纸根据手机陀螺仪读取数字的变化而变换，有点儿像 iOS 的「透视」效果；也可以通过在不同主屏幕之间切换来滚动显示（比较适合横向的动态壁纸）。

此外，Wallpaper Engine 在 Android 上也支持通过播放列表的形式自动更换壁纸。在主页的某一款壁纸上长按，就可以把它添加进入播放列表。播放列表可以设置为按照顺序播放或者随机播放，并且可以设置每款壁纸持续的时间。
当然，我们也可以选择设备上的 mp4 视频、gif 动图或者是照片等，来通过 Wallpaper Engine 创建自己的动态壁纸。说不定你可以把自己家猫的卖萌视频做成壁纸，再加入播放列表循环播放～

文字版 📝
在上周刚拿到这把少数派定制的联名 Keychron K3 并简单拍了段视频分享到一些社交平台之后，不出所料，我收到了蛮多相似的疑问：
「为什么我们还需要一把矮轴机械键盘？」
和传统的机械键盘相比，矮轴机械键盘确实算得上是个新事物，从罗技 G913 把这类产品带到主流市场以来也不过三四年时间。但另一方面呢，不管是 TTC、凯华还是佳达隆，国内几家轴厂也都相继推出了矮轴产品。所以我们第一个话题，就来聊聊矮轴键盘到底好在哪。

虽然伴随着游戏和电竞行业的大热，机械键盘席卷外设圈十多年，但仍然有不少用户坚守着薄膜键盘的阵地：相比于前者主打的指尖爽感，也有一部分人对于更轻松快速的输入体验更加在意。
直白点说，不管是线性还是段落，传统机械轴体 4mm 左右的键程在长时间使用之后是会有一点「腻」的，所以为了结合机械轴体和薄膜键盘各自的优势，矮轴机械键盘诞生了——保留了机械轴的触发原理，但是大大降低了轴体高度和按键行程，使输入体验更加贴近薄膜键盘的轻松高效，同时也保证了一定的机械键盘的手感。

我拿到的这把少数派定制 K3 是佳达隆矮青轴版本。在相比传统轴体大幅缩短的 2.75mm 键程里，这把键盘依然可以感受到清晰紧实的段落感，之后也有足够的键程来完成柔和的触底，而不至于像薄膜键盘一般在「敲钢板」。偏大的回弹力度也比较符合我的喜好，段落声更是短促且清脆（打字声实录可以参考视频 3：35 处）。
当然手感是一件见仁见智的事情，矮轴的诞生姑且算是给了部分用户追求敲击感时一个折中的选择。在此之外，这类产品还有另外一个显而易见的特性，也正是这个特性使其进一步对应了非游戏人群的办公需求——肉眼可见的轻薄使得矮轴键盘类产品在便携性上有着得天独厚的的优势。

相信我派有不少存在如此困扰的读者——对于经常带着笔记本电脑甚至是 iPad Pro 出差并且码字比…</span>

前言｜拍完的照片怎么办
拍完的照片怎么办？这个问题困扰了我很久。
长久以来，至少对于业余摄影师，朋友圈、即刻、图虫等等就是照片最终的归宿。我后来发现更糟的是，翻来覆去不过是换个平台传上去而已，最多一周以后就再难有人问津，包括自己。想想连家里那些落灰的旧影集，时不时还会被拿出来翻翻，我就觉得这些新鲜的记忆不能埋在网络里就算了。
我不专门学摄影，也相对少交流，过去几年都在瞎拍，这种草根性一定程度上影响了我了解「摄影集」这一概念的进程。从「影集」变成「摄影集」，好像专业度提高了不少。
绕了很多弯路，也庆幸得到了很多帮助，我最终完成了。搜了搜我派上没有系统的教程，仅有一篇 @kokdemo 前辈所做的台历教程，读后也觉得受益匪浅，经历了许多相似的困难。我许久没码字了，这次抛砖引玉但从头到尾地聊聊怎么做一本摄影集。

挑选｜重新翻一遍库存
作为一个毫无资历的小法师，我无法指导大家拍摄，更多是如何挑选一系列适合放进摄影集的照片。如果你一直有非常好的图片管理习惯，那么这一步就会非常容易。要是没有的话，做本摄影集其实也是个很好的开始，挑选的过程本身也是图片管理的过程。

当然要符合自己的审美，选自己最喜爱的那些照片。

在中国现有的五座“世界美食之都”里，顺德是最特殊的。澳门的后缀是“特别行政区”，成都、扬州、淮安的后缀都是“市”，只有顺德的后缀是“区”。看起来，顺德似乎天生就比其他四位低上一级，更像一个“小地方”。很多人不知道的是，站在顺德区背后的，是佛山市——如果说顺德这个“小地方”，是粤菜皇冠上的明珠，那么佛山，就是皇冠本冠无疑。由高明濑粉、禅城柱侯牛杂、西樵牛奶浸鸡、大良野鸡卷、勒流水蛇羹、九江煎堆、三水蛋散、白坭冬瓜盅、伦教糕、石湾及第粥、盐步秋茄、三洲烧鹅、均安蒸猪、陈村粉等等所组成的佛山版“报菜名”，不仅反映了这里丰饶的物产和讲究的烹饪艺术，更彰显了深植于地理人文之上的，源远流长的饮食传统。






No.1 壹
在大多数人眼里，佛山是一座与黄飞鸿、叶问、李小龙高度绑定的城市，在文弱谦退的中国南方，它是少有的，被打上了尚武、悍勇标签的地方。一个不易察觉的细节是，这三位“武林高手”，似乎都没怎么饿过肚子：黄飞鸿十六岁开设武馆给人授艺，生意始终兴隆，早早当上了老板；叶问十七岁赴香港读书，接受西式教育，电影《叶问》一开场，他就过着喝茶、练武、住别墅的神仙日子；而李小龙，则从出生起就是美国华侨，在移民热土旧金山的独栋独院里长大。在那个多数中国人都挣扎在贫困线上的年代，这三位佛山人毫无疑问是“人上人”的代表。



事实上，有钱有闲、生活洋派，不仅是黄飞鸿、叶问和李小龙的个人状态，更折射了佛山地区一直以来的富庶和开放。佛山的地理位置很特殊，珠江最重要的两大支流：西江和北江在此交汇，它们带来了南岭山区的大量腐殖质，并冲击出一片河网密布的巨大三角洲。相比上游城市清远、肇庆，佛山的土地平旷而肥沃；相比下游的江门、中山和珠海，这里又因为远离海洋而没有海蚀侵袭、土壤盐碱化的困扰。对农耕文明来说，这是一块不可多得的宜居区。

                    <span>是否有领导力，可以按照领导力的定义判断，这里给出一份领导力模型的参考，主要包含做「事」、做「人」以及整合「人」和「事」三个层面

「事」的层面
核心能力1： 项目推动能力（关注问题识别和推动执行，强调对外）
子维度包括： 

敏锐洞察：随时了解竞争对手和业内同行的动态，敏锐识别市场机会和风险，通过分析性、阐释性、评鉴性思考，集思广益，解决问题；制定的方案经得起时间的考验；善于发现创新想法。 
追求成效：具有不屈不挠的进攻精神，不达目标绝不放弃，坚定不移地推动自己和他人为取得成效而努力。 

核心能力2：任务分解能力（关注资源调配和规划分解，对内） 
子维度包括： 

目标分解：围绕任务目标，组织下属制定计划、分解目标，讨论和优化工作开展方式，使效率提升并保障任务的完整执行。 
资源整合：面对市场机会，果断决策，合理配置人力、物力、预算等资源，指导并带领下属团队以最快的速度达成目标。 

「人」的层面
核心能力3：沟通和跨部门协作能力（对外）： 
子维度描述： 

沟通能力：以积极主动、换位思考的思维方式和娴熟的沟通技巧，妥善处理与他人的关系，促成相互理解，获得支持与配合。
组织影响力：针对组织内外部情况，使用复杂的策略方法，产生影响，营造良好的内部工作氛围和外部合作环境，以完成工作目标。 

核心能力4：人才培养能力（对内）： 
子维度描述： 

选才育人：慧眼识人，发现和关注有潜力的员工；付出时间和精力支持全公司的高潜力人才发展。 
组建高效团队：通过授权、激励等管理手段充分发挥团队成员优势，促进团队合作，解决人员冲突，激发团队成员的动力，营造良好团队氛围。 

整合「事」与「人」的专业精神
核心能力5：专业精神
子维度描述： 

把事情做到极致：不断挑战更高标准，超越目标，在互联网领域创造出更为持久和非凡的成就。 
拥抱变化：面对复杂多变的外部环境，不畏难、不退缩，主动调整、寻求改变，引领团队朝着新的具有挑战性的方向转变。 

正如领导力大师约翰.科特所说，“管理是确定具体的计划，然后配备人员等组织资源，并监督和控制执行过程；领导则是确定长远的方向，联合群众朝着此方向前进，并激励和鼓舞他们。” 领导力不是领导的专利，领导力是一种影响别人的艺术。所以，我们每个人无论职位高低，无论是否管理者，都可能随时在某种场合扮演“领导者”的角色，影响我们身边的人，都需要“领导力”。

                    <span>动画明天就上线了。
本来我还兴高采烈的准备追更，结果腿突然摔断了，只能躺着追更了……
很多人会私下问我，动画好看不好看，大家都以为我是看过了的，其实没有。
我还没有看过动画，只是制作的过程里看过一些分镜，参与了剧本的创作。
我始终认为，专业的事情一定要由专业的人来做，我虽然是原作者，但我擅长的是文字表达，而不是动画语言的表达。
对此，我是完全的信任监制、导演、创作团队。
现在，我作为原作者，其实就像普通观众在等新番一样，比较激动。
昨天看到op之后更激动了。
这个op是我近几年看过最好的，从作画精致程度、设计之巧妙，都让我眼前一亮。
而且，我还自己参与了一部分作词……
如果有个什么“年度最佳op”的评选，我感觉这个op一定可以入选……
当初刚与腾讯动漫、大火鸟合作的时候，他们就专门来了洛阳。
一开始我还挺担心沟通会有问题，毕竟行业里资本支配原作者的传说屡见不鲜，哈哈。
但后来发现我多虑了，监制ask和导演少爷都很好沟通，都是超级有意思的人。
沟通基本就是在吃吃喝喝、欢声笑语里结束的。
其中聊了怎么把握大王饶命里的人物关系，怎么把握搞笑元素的呈现方式，剧情脉络。
大家都很尊重原著，甚至过于尊重原著。
我一直在跟他们聊，原著从文字转换动画，肯定要有所改变，所以未必要全都按照原著来……
但ask和少爷对此很谨慎，他们怕丢失了原著的味道。
所以总体来说，整个动画制作过程对我来说，是开心且愉快的。
最后，希望明天动画上线后可以大火大爆哈哈，毕竟我献祭了一条腿，一定要制霸一整年！

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
在之前的文章里，就提到过勇士的防守死穴：对上真正顶级天赋的大个子，他们的体系会被强拆。这也是勇士以夺冠为目标情况下，面临的最大隐患。而今天对太阳的比赛里，这种更多停留在“讨论”阶段的隐患，终于露出了危险的一角。全场比赛，在防守端，108.3分的百回合失分也远差于大样本下联盟第一的100.4分。
而将勇士的防守打到这个地步的，是布克或保罗的挡拆持球攻吗？布克只打了15分钟，保罗的回合占有率也只有18.2%，并没有像惯常预计的那样，接过布克留下来的球权，包揽一场比赛的进攻。真正让勇士无法防守的，是中锋艾顿，打出了远远超出常规赛20.2%水平的30.1%回合占有率，真实命中率也保持在57.8%，而他的得分方式却并没有比平时有所进化，83.3%都来自于油漆区，且两分球受助攻率72.7%，依然是我们印象中的那个出手范围较为狭窄的篮下终结点。

更多需要控球手“喂饼”的艾顿，常理上讲似乎不应该成为勇士防守的障碍，反而是勇士最喜欢的那种进攻方式。本赛季的勇士，将小阵容提到了常规使用的程度，正牌中锋鲁尼只有18.3分钟的时间，18.8分钟的奥托波特、14.9分钟的别利查，分别在五号位打了53%和100%的时间。这套小阵容对上线持球人的压制能力极强，几乎可以在任何对位中都不被抓住防守弱点，且可以兼顾到对侧翼的轮转。对持球人的局部空间以人数压缩，对侧翼依靠轮转补位，外扩的防守风格可能出现的篮下空虚问题，则由对持球人的传球线路的封锁来缓解。由此，勇士便做到了对对手进攻组织与串联的切割，对发动机有重点施压，对弱侧也有人员顾到，让对手无法通过个人威胁与顺畅传导盘出足够合理的进攻回合，被迫打成高难度的单打和出手。
本赛季，勇士有53.9%的防守回合处在篮下15FT以外，集体外扩程度排名联盟第四。而在效果上，与勇士对阵的球队场均只能拿到21.6次助攻，联盟第四，被防到42.…</span>

                    <span>其实把“野外露营”和“精致露营”作为对比选项，就像把“西餐”和“水果”拿来对比一样，在概念的内涵和外延上，怎么说都有点“差辈”。


基本上，露营可以分为三种：


第一种，Bushcraft露营，更倾向于荒野求生。
Bush是澳大利亚对森林的称呼，Craft则是技能的意思。所以Bushcraft也就是那种住山洞，或者拿树枝搭个窝棚，最不济带一块油布搭个避难所的露营。

这是回归原始生活的一种露营，什么现代化工具都没有，什么钻木取火了，什么用树皮做绳索了，什么拿木头挖陷坑了，玩就玩最野的，没有足够的知识、经验、体魄、意志，是做不到的：
赤身裸体户外露营，夜晚如何取暖御寒_哔哩哔哩_bilibili

当然，在国内，怎么钻木取火荒野求生，那都是动嘴的，实际上绝大部分Bushcraft爱好者连公园都没睡过，真动手的都是买买买，什么2000块钱的英国手工斧子，什么1500块钱的美国煤油灯，什么3000块钱的瑞典柴火炉。没钱的就买什么战术鱼钩、钛合金火柴盒啥的，逐渐沦为COSPLAY艺术、手工艺品收藏，和YY了。

这其实不是Bushcraft露营，而是Bushcraft风格露营，也就是牛奶和牛奶风味饮料的区别了。


另外从环保的角度说，古人这么露营是没办法，从现代露营的角度来说，明明是从大都市开着越野车进林子，明明有20块钱、200多克一个，一个能用两天的气罐不带，非要带好几斤重的斧子去乱砍树木，破坏环境，就为了烧起一堆柴火感觉很炫酷，我个人是对此相当持保留意见的。



无痕山林的准则，不说全都对，但既然你要去露营，最好还是要了解一下：
1.事前充分的规划与准备，
2.在可承受地点行走宿营，
3.适当处理垃圾维护环境，
4.保持环境原有的风貌，
5.减低用火对环境的冲击，
6.尊重野生动植物，
7.考虑其他的使用者。





第二种，经典露营/常规露营。
也就是最为我们熟知…</span>

Welcome to another Marley Rainbow Six Siege best funny moments video, full of waffle, one taps, aces, and clutches... But the main focus is trying the new meta, not shotgun meta, but the sniper meta! Operation High Calibre is out but before we try out the new operator Thorn and the new gun, the Uzi, I wanted to see if we would vibe with Kali and Glaz.</span>

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are not FOUR hunters but FIVE instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost AND my friend awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It&#x27;s a race, and it&#x27;s super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we&#x27;ll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

                    <span>Introduction
Push notifications are alerts that are &quot;pushed&quot; to a user&#x27;s device by apps, even when those apps aren&#x27;t open. In the case of web push notifications, the web app receives messages pushed to it from a server at any time. This includes when the application is active or inactive or not open in the browser and when the browser is inactive. Firebase Cloud Messaging is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send these messages at no cost.
In this tutorial, we are going to be walking through how to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging to receive web push notifications in your React.js app.

                    <span>If the mobile app doesn’t correspond to the latest design trends, it will probably be out of users’ interest.
Making the app look modern and beautiful is challenging, considering that trends never stay the same, and there is always a new trend to appear. But following the design trends is a must for every app developer.
We understand that It is not always possible to keep track of all the tendencies and trends in the industry. There are always new guidelines, animation content, video, new approaches to illustrations, and many other concepts you need to find time to study and test first.
We have completed this task for you and collected 10 top design trends and ideas to use in 2022 and make your apps’ design stand out:

                    <span>Tailoring a user experience for different devices can get complicated. There are many approaches to rendering a different view for mobile, tablet and desktop users.
This post presents a way to offer a tailored render for different breakpoints in the same component.
The benefit of this approach is useful when you need to render the same content components in an app and have them render a specific set of HTML based on viewport size.
Firstly, the breakpoints need defining. This sets the viewport widths and the render function to use at this breakpoint.
const breakpointConfig &#x3D; {
  reactive: false,
  breakpoints: {
    992: { method: &#x27;renderTablet&#x27; },
    768: { method: &#x27;renderMobile&#x27; },

                    <span>Sometimes mining can seem to be too complex for the average computer user, so I thought about putting together a quick guide to get you excited about mining cryptocurrency and LINK in particular.
Anyone can start mining Chainlink LINK with any laptop in under 5 minutes using this guide, regardless of your technical skill level you will be able to increase your crypto knowledge and start mining LINK with your CPU and GPU today!!
Chainlink is a decentralized blockchain oracle network like Tellor built on Ethereum. The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts.

Continuous integration, continuous development, and ANOTHER CD. As expected in DevOps fashion, the two CDs are often treated interchangeably. In reality, they need to be set apart as their own processes. If organizations want to be bleeding edge and match the productivity of large corporations like Amazon, Facebook, and Google - hopefully not their arguably unethical coding practices - they need to embrace all three facets. The final CD is seen as somewhat of a unicorn in the industry as of now. However, it is gaining levels of normalization at select firms.
So what are all three tenets?
We will walk through each step and their implementations with specific open-source tools and their respective use-cases.

                    <span>Factory Method(virtual constructor) provides an interface for creating objects in a super-class, but defers instantiation to sub-classes.
Consider an application which has to access a class, but does not know which class to choose form among a set of sub-classes of the parent class. The application class can’t predict the sub-class to instantiate as the choice might depend on numerous factors, such as the state of the application at run-time or its configuration.
The Factory method pattern solves this problem by encapsulating the functionality of selecting and instantiating the appropriate class inside a designated method, which we refer to as the factory method.
The factory method pattern can be used in cases where:
A class can not know or predict the object it must create

                    <span>Lately, we started a project to improve the performance of our main app. We identified a few API calls we were calling a lot. Results of these calls can change but not very very often so it&#x27;s not an issue to cache the result for a minute or so.
So I implemented a very easy cache that will reuse active promises and returns already resolved results for a minute after an initial resolution.
This article will go over the code in detail.
function getData(key){
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    console.log(&#x27;starting get &#x27; + key)

    setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {
        console.log(&#x27;ending get &#x27; + key)
        resolve(key);
    }, 1000);
  })
}

Easy enough.
Now we need a few variables where we store our promises, results, and resolution times. We will also create a new function that …</span>

Introduction
Say whatever you will about the world of app creation, but there is no denying that it is exceptionally vast and contains practically endless possibilities within itself. 
What is important here is the fact that the vastness of possibilities the world of app creation provides is what allows you to enter it seamlessly. And, even more than that, it allows you to create great life-improving applications and significantly improve your finances as well. Take a look at how to create a fully working application from two points of view: a theoretical and a practical one.

                    <span>It’s been a year since I graduated from my Bootcamp and about 8 months of working at CodeCast. While I’m still a junior developer through and through, I’ve started to get more comfortable with where I am at. Looking back I can see a lot of things I wish I had done differently, which is great, to be honest. Being able to recognize that I’ve changed and grown as a developer is fantastic. 
I previously wrote a post about some of the common mistakes that junior developers make. Since then, I’ve come up with a new list of mistakes I see myself and others making, so I thought it was the perfect time to write a second part. Without further ado, let’s get into it!

In this article, we will discuss how you can create the release note tools using ReactJS.
Step 1: Installing React
create-react-app.
npx create-react-app release-notes-app

Step 2: Installing Tailwind
In this project, we&#x27;ll be using Tailwind - CSS framework, that&#x27;ll help us in rapidly building the interface for release notes.
Next, by using npm, we install all the tailwind dependencies and set up its configuration file. 
All you have to do is follow the simple instructions at tailwind CSS documentation.

These sorts of divisive claims bring about nothing but toxicity to our community, and only alienate the junior developers who are new to it. Especially for the profit of some traffic on Twitter or elsewhere, it&#x27;s despicable.
They paint a completely wrong image of the web dev scene, too - being a web developer is much more about the perpetual process of self-improving, learning new tools &amp; technologies and experimenting with methods to combine them in the best way, rather than knowing some constant list of terms (which are often occasionally useful at best).

                    <span>最新的MN3增加了画笔的上限。可以使用七支笔。
偶然想到，可不可以用来画画呢？
就试了一下。
结论是，橡皮几乎不能用。因为是不分图层擦除。
所以，还是打好草稿，确定不太走形，然后一点点把线条堆上去。
另外，无意间试了性能的上限——线条复杂到这种程度，就有点卡。

                    <span>冲动购买 Flip3 之后，我遇到一个大问题。
我之前的两台手机都有双 SIM 卡支持，以至于我完全忘记了「实体双 SIM 卡也是一个特性」这件事。到手前一小时我才发现，这块小家伙不光没有大电池，还没有第二张 SIM 卡的容身所。本着不要多花钱的原则，我试着用了几天闲置的 iPhone 6s，可它实在服役太久，换过的电池和屏幕相继出问题。实在忍受不了点击不到的边角按钮和用到 40% 就突然消失的电量的我，做了一个现在看起来非常差劲，甚至有点离谱的决定：
我买了 2018 年上市的黑莓 KEY2，满足自己对实体全键盘最后的执念。

实体全键盘，遗失的美好
其实购买的时候，我就没对它抱有多大期望。因为即使成色再新，它也是一部 2018 年发布的手机了。我当然还有其他选择，比如发布时间更近的 Unihertz Titan 与 Pocket，可它们一来配置没有优秀多少，二来那块正方形的屏幕据说会带来不少兼容性问题。综合考虑下，现在市面上的全键盘手机，最适合我的就只剩下 KEY2。想来稍微有点悲哀。
有朋友说 TCL 代工的黑莓已经不再是原汁原味的黑莓了，但 KEY2 的外形与手感仍然带着我熟悉的味道。骁龙 660 处理器，和我因为卡顿淘汰的坚果 Pro 2 一样。我这么说可能有些奇怪，但这两部手机都像是对千篇一律的圆角直板全触屏提出的抗议，当然下场也一样，它们都停留在时代进步的扬尘里。相比之下，坚果可能还显得更先进一些，KEY2 基本就是电子设备的活化石。

我到现在还是认为，对于大部分一般消费者来说，黑莓的意义就是那些黑莓一样的小小按键。这也是到手之后我急着确认的第一件事。作为持有 9790 的前黑莓用户，我并不觉得 KEY2 的键盘手感有什么明显的差距，除了那一颗空格。不知道是不是因为集成了指纹识别器，它的晃动十分明显，打字时都能明显感到跷跷板。至于其他小键，在我看来和 979…</span>

🏆 Users’ Choice 2021 榜单出炉

到了十二月，今年的 Play Store 的应用评选榜单 Users’ Choice 2021 也照例发布。
按照惯例，今年的 Users’ Choice 评选出的 App 虽然对于大部分国内 Android 玩家讲未必全是熟悉的应用/游戏，而且不同地区之间的奖项也略有区别，但作为 Android 最大应用分发平台 Play Store 每年推出的评选，这份榜单往往具有很强的「时效性」，能反映出过去一年 Android 应用生态以及全球社会的各种变迁，因此仍有很多看点。
值得特别注意的一个改变是：今年应用榜单针对 Google TV、Android 平板以及 WearOS 手表等泛 Android 平台应用，为其加入了专属的评选奖项，让这些原本一直属于相对「边缘化」的应用需求也终于走上台前，得以被更多用户所知。这也与 Google 近两年一直在推动的改变不谋而合。
游戏部分，《宝可梦大集结》（Pokémon UNITE）与《英雄联盟手游）（League of Legends: Wild Rift）这两款国内玩家也不会很陌生的现象级游戏也很自然地榜上有名。

后续我们也会推出关于此次应用评选结果的专题文章，敬请期待。

                    <span>少数派会员今年 6 月 1 日正式上线，到现在已经整整半年了。对于这个新生的板块，我们一方面满怀信心和诚意，同时也深知经验有限，无法一开始就尽善尽美。因此，会员上线以来，我们始终没有停止过搜集反馈、回顾反思；会员计划的内容和形式也经历了诸多微调。在此特别感谢已经购买会员并给我们提出了宝贵建议的朋友们。
站在这个半年的节点上，我想亲自跟新老会员聊聊会员计划的成长历程，谈谈我们目前为止的发现和思考，希望大家耐心看完。

从梦想到实践，少数派付费内容的早期尝试
尽管「内容免费分享」的理念似乎已经根植于互联网文化之中，但这种模式是以早期小规模、精英化的互联网生态为前提的。在用户多元化、信息爆炸以至冗余的当下，「既要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草」是难以保证持久、优质的输出的。尽管内容从业者通过各种方式绕过付费这道坎，希望通过推广和带货来为内容生产输血，但实践表明这种模式并不容易形成稳定循环，潜在利益冲突也容易侵蚀媒体的信任根基。
基于这样的思考，我们很早就开始尝试探索健康、公允的内容付费模式。早在 2017 年、少数派的商业前景尚不明朗之际，我们仍然坚持投入大量心血，推出了第一套付费教程——《用更现代的方式做任务管理：Todoist 完全使用指南》。
当时，少数派不仅没有专门的付费栏目模块，连支付系统也尚未建立。然而，凭借教程本身的质量和忠实用户的信任，我们依靠一篇介绍文章、一个收款表单，也获得了五万元的销售收入。
五万元不算多，去掉给作者的分成，留给网站的收益更少。但这次尝试为我们验证了教程内容的价值，给了我们信心在内容付费这条路上走下去——哪怕再小众的领域，都有付费内容存在的空间；这本来就是少数派应该做的事。
第一次成功的试水后，我们在之后的一年中陆续推出了 设计课、信息管理 等付费栏目，受到了不少好评。但与此同时…</span>

                    <span>前言
如果没有亲自尝试过下面这款 App，你可能会对这个画面感到迷惑。它既不简单，又不复杂；你不知道它究竟能做什么，但它看起来又不是完全无法预测，毫无规律。

这个 App 的全名是 Uzu, An Interactive Light Show。简单来说，它充分地利用了 multi-touch 多点触摸屏的特性：根据触点的个数及其移动轨迹来给予用户不同的反馈，让屏幕上的发光粒子跟着你的手指上演一场流光溢彩的灯光秀。
如今，multi-touch 对于大多数人来说早已不是什么神奇的技术，但在 iPhone 和 iPad 刚刚诞生的那几年里，它却如同魔法。当 Jobs 在舞台上首次展示如何在 iPhone 上利用手指「推动」一个菜单列表，从而实现页面滚动时，观众的惊叹就说明了一切。
自诞生以来，iPhone 就被认为是当之无愧的「智能」手机，即 smart phone。而 smart 这个词，除了「智能」以外，更有一层「耳聪目明」的意思。从 multi-touch 屏幕，到加速度感应器，再到后来的罗盘仪、原深感摄像头系统，历代 iOS 设备无不体现着这样对外界变化的灵敏反应。而宽大多彩的屏幕，又从输出的方面丰富了人们对「手机这个物件能做什么」的期待。
这些神奇的技术当然吸引了众多的 App 开发者。不同于今天强调专业性或「生产力」的市场，在早期的 App Store 中，大量的 App 都是「炫酷为主，功能为辅」，处处强调着这些新设备为 App 开发给予的极大灵活性，从而也吸引了一批又一批的新用户购入了他们的第一台智能设备，其中也包括我。
直至今日，当我们回顾这些功能简单，但制作精良的 App 时，我们仍然会被它们的「浪漫」所打动。它们体量不大，但总能做好自己的一件事，在如今看来就更是难能可贵。幸运的是，它们中的一些直到今天都还能在 iOS 15 上运行，让大家有机会随着我的这…</span>

近两年，由于疫情和经济形势，让很多人把更多时间消费待在家中。有个副业打底，成了不少人的想法。不过想是想，做是做，真正能搞的副业有哪些呢？这次老锅来带你看看录制有声书这个行当，门槛不算很高，但变现也没有知乎上面各种看似回答实则软文说的那么简单。凡事说让你轻轻松松赚多少多少的，那指定是要拉进来后噶韭菜了。

 
成为一名优秀的声音工作者，并不是一件易事。而能够变现，其实更是难上加难。要想达到专业程度的有声书录制，还是建议至少要准备电容麦克风+独立声卡+配置尚可的主机。笔记本由于散热问题可能会突然起飞，所以不是很推荐，必须要用的话也建议放得远点并且和麦克风隔开。大机箱风道相对较好，日常使用自然不会有太大的噪音，如何选择还是建议看个人情况。

大部分的专业声卡都是为音乐工作者所设计的，比如说像乐器输入接口就完全用不到。而且稍微可用的价格都小几千，初期整体投入没个大几千下不来，不是一般人能承受的。

正好哥们最近就开始录书了，这半年也是把家里的儿童房改造了下，虽然是匆匆忙忙上场但是现在也够用了。来让我们看看这个录书工作角到底是如何配置的吧，如果有入行的兴趣建议收藏下避避雷。

                    <span>下班回家再看，不过作为“JOJO小鬼”，我觉得第六部的替身都非常值得一说，我是说这些替身名字的来源。一个一个来。
Stone Free
从第四部荒木老贼开始使用欧美音乐（专辑or单曲）作为替身来源开始，其主角的替身往往都有着非同一般的意义。第四部的“Crazy Diamond”是来自Pink Floyd的专辑《Wish You Were Here》的《Shine On You Crazy Diamond》，这个歌曲贯穿整张专辑，长达26分钟的大长篇；而第五部的“Gold Experience”这是来自老贼最喜欢的歌手之一Prince的专辑《The Gold Experience》。也就是说，主角的替身选用，老贼是有很大的私心的，基本都是他极为欣赏的。
而到了第六部，也是延续了这个思路。老贼给空条徐伦的替身《Stone Free》正是吉他之神Jimi Hendrix在The Jimi Hendrix Experience乐队时期所创作的《Stone Free》，所在专辑为《Are You Experienced?》。

课后提问，第五部也有一个用Jimi歌曲当替身的人，请问这个替身使者是谁。
Goo Goo Dolls
替身名字源自同名美国另类摇滚乐队Goo Goo Dolls，也可能来自乐队首专《Goo Goo Dolls》。这支乐队在国内知名度并不算太高，其实在国外首专和二专名声也不是很响，直到那首歌的出现直接让Goo Goo Dolls一炮而红，即《Iris》，还是因为尼古拉斯·凯奇主演的《天使之城》。

Manhattan Transfer
荒木老贼涉猎广泛的代表，你以为只有摇滚乐队？上来就是一个合唱团。名字来自美国爵士合唱团The Manhattan Transfer。
所以后来《第八部》有了流行音乐的Born This Way也算是意料之中了。

                    <span>&quot;I&#x27;m so much more open to stuff now.&quot; On the verge of 100 million followers, Billie Eilish is ready to step back into the world as the most comfortable version of herself. Filled with new life experience, two more Grammys than last year, and a few less of her infamous one-liners, Billie Eilish truly is happier than ever. From hosting the Met Gala to being the reason Oscar de la Renta no longer sells fur, watch to see how much Billie has grown since her first interview in 2017 with Vanity Fair.

                    <span>Lately, I&#x27;ve been tending to lean more towards employing a monolithic approach in system architecture. On paper, using micro-services seems like an ideal solution. The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I&#x27;ve watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.
I&#x27;m not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn&#x27;t really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.
So my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?</span>

Literally, developing a game engine is not on my resume... yet! So any code or ways of doing anything you read here, is just what I&#x27;ve figured out and works for me, which by no means should suggest to you that it is the proper way to do what ever it may be. Please consult your local guru first.
OK, now that we have that established... Please consider the following as entertainment and should you lean along the way with me, that&#x27;s wonderful!
Now, by the time of writing this article, I am several months into this undertaking. I&#x27;ll describe in future posts what the engine is capable of, but for today, let me tell you about what happened over the last 2 weeks. I will likely break them up into separate posts for easier consumption.

                    <span>Video is one of the best ways for capturing audience attention. Product demonstrations, property tours, tutorials, and keynotes all make great content—provided that they’re readily searchable by your team and visitors alike. Even though tagging and categorization help organize videos and make them easy to find, the labeling process is labor intensive, taking time away from key tasks like creating new videos.
The solution? Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content. Video tagging extends image classification to image sequences, capable of detecting types of scenes (cities, mountains, the seaside) and objects (people, cars), and even inferring whether the content is appropriate for public viewing.

                    <span>Functional components in React are most beautiful because of React Hooks. With Hooks, we can change state, perform actions when components are mounted and unmounted, and much more.
While all these are beautiful, there is a little caveat (or maybe not) that is a little bit frustrating when working with useEffect hook.
Before we look at this issue let&#x27;s do a quick recap on the useEffect hook.
The useEffect hook allows you to perform actions when components mount and unmount.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // actions performed when component mounts

  return () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // actions to be performed when component unmounts
  }
}, []);

The callback function of the useEffect function is invoked depending on the second parameter of the useEffect function.
The second parameter is an array of dependencies. You…</span>

                    <span>Just wrapped up Day 2 of Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent and from the Midnight Madness concert, to building an AI-Powered Image Processor during Talia Nassi&#x27;s workshop, to catching up with the amazing Adrienne Tacke from MongoDB....there is a TON going on Vegas! 
In this episode of the Tech Stack Playbook, I&#x27;ll be sharing more about AWS re:Invent - the year&#x27;s largest global tech conference that brings together leaders, builders, innovators, and creators from cloud, DevOps, serverless, app development, and software engineering from all around the world.
Also, I built an AI-Powered image processing application that can take images and analyze certain features about the uploaded images…so that was pretty cool 😱
In this blog post and the blog posts to come this week, my hope is to vlog through the entire week and share all that I&#x27;m learning and building with you all so whether you are attending virtually or in person, this AWS re:Invent series on the Tech Stack Playbook will help you gain skills, level up in tech, and boost your software engineering abilities from the sessions I&#x27;m attending throughout the conference.
Here’s a glance at what you’ll learn in this blog post:




It&#x27;s going to be a major week for cloud and tech in general, so I am so excited to bring you along for the ride.

                    <span>Using Existing Tooling to Make Changes Reversible


This morning I deployed a major change to the production servers of DEV.to. 
Feature update: Feed - DEV Community.


Adjusting the feed is a big deal. It’s the front door of DEV.to.
We wanted to gather information about the impact of changing the front door. At Forem we use the Field Test gem. This allows us to run different experiments. I configured Field Test to assign 20% of the folks to the new strategy and 80% of the folks to the prior strategy.
To insulate from upstream libraries, we often wrap those libraries in our own implementations. This helps with the principle of least exposure; rely on the narrowest interface possible. I wrote the AbExperiment class to be the wrapper around Field Test. With the wrapper, I allowed for the sys…</span>

                    <span>话说现在密码泄露事件层出不穷，为了以后账户密码不怕被一锅端，很多人都想办法针对不同网站设置多个不同的密码 (我们专门为此撰写过一篇文章)，这样虽然更安全，但也稍微带来了记忆上的负担。
对于密码的存储与管理，我们之前介绍过 KeePass 和 LastPass，前者就是开源的本地帐号密码存储管理工具，后者提供浏览器插件，可记录下你每个网站的帐密并自动填写登录。不过由于 LastPass 所有密码数据都是保存在网上的，很多人都担心其安全性。而今天介绍的 1Password 则集多家之长，支持手机、电脑多平台同步，密码保存在本地，是目前我认为是我见过的最完美的密码管理解决方案……

                    <span>悲观主义哲学家叔本华曾说：

生命是一团欲望，不满足则痛苦，满足则无聊，人生就在痛苦和无聊之间摇摆。

不知他如果穿越到 2021 年，见识了一个被短视频包围，在微博和豆瓣鹅组左右横跳，以第一时间吃瓜的现代社会之后，还会坚持自己的观点吗？
但其实「无聊」一词，有着丰富的内涵。它不是一种无所事事的虚无，而应该是一种有意为之，为「有聊」而蓄力的状态。
说起「有聊」，又是一个被消费主义重新定义（或者说是被创造出来的）的词。何为「有聊」?难道春天去樱花树下、夏天去海边冲浪、秋天去山林里露营、冬天去雪山滑雪，就是所谓的「有聊」吗?
无聊抑或有聊，值得得好好聊聊。
第七期再读播客，我们请到《你有权保持无聊》一文的作者 @Shooca （当然也是 @重新想象Lab 专栏主理人），来一起聊聊关于「无聊」的话题。

作为一个苹果全家桶用户，Apple Music 是我欣赏音乐的不二选择。比起国内的音乐 App 那些「花里胡哨」的社交和直播功能，它干净且纯粹的听歌体验和低廉的价格获得了身边不少朋友的好评。然而，我所使用的 Apple Music 却和别人的有那么点「不一样」：尽管 Apple Music 的曲库已经在不断完善，而我也开了大陆和香港两个地区的订阅，但在我的 iPhone 和 iPad 上，「同步资料库」的按钮却一直是关闭的。
没错，在 2021 年的今天，我依旧坚定着拒绝着音乐订阅制，还在用着 20 年前的方式来听歌：购买 &gt; 下载 &gt; 同步 &gt; 欣赏。所以从某种角度上来看，iPod 这个东西的灵魂一直都存在于我的 iPhone 和 iPad 中，未曾消逝过。

而谈到「音乐订的订阅制」，往往离不开的另一个词语便是「流媒体」。要分清楚的是，我并不拒绝流媒体，因为它本质是一种技术，指的就是服务提供商可以将一系列的媒体文件打包压缩之后放到服务器上，经由互联网实时传输来让用户欣赏内容，而不需要耗费大量的时间在下载这件事情上。简单来说，一切「在线欣赏」的媒体、游戏内容，都归属于流媒体的范畴。我虽然没有开启 iCloud 资料库同步，但我却并不拒绝使用这种技术来欣赏媒体内容。
但音乐订阅制不同，它最核心的一个特点是「租赁」。也就是说，你所拥有的仅仅只是在服务商所规定的生效时段内聆听这首音乐的权利。这些音乐服务商就像你所租房的房东一样，给钱就能留下，不给钱就说再见。只不过一般而言，流媒体音乐服务商们不会因为你拖欠房租而「赶你出门」—— 因为根…</span>

                    <span>点进来的时候是不是以为，我写的肯定不是「把手机时间调早四个小时，给足心理暗示，就算十点起也是一种六点起」这种自欺欺人的方法？
……不好意思啊，还真就是调表这么简单。只不过我是反着调的，而且只调了两个小时。
所以现在每天早上八点闹钟准时把我叫醒，按照正常世界的时间流速，我真的是早上六点起来的。
你到底为什么会有这种奇怪的想法啊
最初当然是因为英国绝望的冬令时制度，十月最后的周日晚上，夏令时结束，时间往后调一小时，回到了格林尼治标准时间（Greenwich Mean Time, GMT）。
这也带来了所有住在高纬度地区人类的共同烦恼：天黑太早，特别致郁。NHS 还专门有一个网页，提供季节性抑郁（Seasonal Affective Disorder, SAD）的相关信息。
现在只是十一月中，然而每天下午四点钟的时候天就黑了，并且还在不断提前中。加上英国特有的阴雨天气，曾经一月有几次三点出门就天黑得不行。没有光明的时间里，无论实际时间如何，常给我一种「到了入睡时间」的感觉，想要做事都提不起精神来。

我刚来英国的时候十六七岁，整个人有用不完的能量，伦敦又是个远超我此前居住地的国际大都市，娱乐和学习上头的时候哪管白天黑夜，加上一个人住没人管我，通宵达旦还能神清气爽，面不改色吃光半桶炸鸡。哪懂什么熬夜胸口痛啊，脱发啊，长痘啊，留学就是好山好水好寂寞啊——「网上的人都在说什么屁话！」1
就是报应来得太快，人生哪有第二个十七岁呢……！
四点多天黑这件事在我的认知里，从「以前开膛手杰克就是在这里杀人的吧，好刺激」「在图书馆里开灯学习，好有氛围」变成了「我不会走路上被人杀了吧」「天黑了学什么习，我要睡觉」。
两年前的某一个下午，上了一天学回家的我走在路灯下，脑子里不断想着长长的 to-do-list，得出的结论是「世界和我快点有一个完蛋吧」。回到家提不起精神学习，想找朋友聊天，却因为时差的缘…</span>

笔者按：本文有视频版本，但视频文案与本文有较多区别。文章对理论的阐述更清晰，视频则宽泛且综合些。若对理论感兴趣，更推荐阅读文章。
 
一直以来，我对于「如何构筑系统」都有着深厚的兴趣，前后也写了一些自己的思考和实践。几个月前，我发表了一篇名为《打造宿舍收纳系统》的文章，尝试从桌搭入手讲述一些建立收纳系统的思路。文章收获了一些好评，不过我始终觉得有的地方还是没说到位，对方法论的描述不够具体，介绍产品太多，谁若想要借鉴，很多信息可能难以复用。
《东西我都装好了｜由极致性价比打造的宿舍收纳系统》
现在，当毕业后回顾曾经的宿舍生活，我终于逐渐参悟埋藏于产品背后的收纳逻辑。所以，这次我想再来聊一聊，到底如何构筑收纳系统。
先解构后建构
「收纳」本质上是解决「人」和「环境」之间的矛盾。任何收纳都是协调的结果，是一种谈判，是在有限空间前提下的排列组合。同时，既然解构是一切建构的前提，那么要「构筑收纳系统」，就要分别理解「人」和「环境」这两大因素。
生活中「人」的需求
早起来不及吃早饭，会觉得饿，于是学会提前一晚准备面包；存放面包需要空间，于是在桌面上随手一丢……这是很常见的做法。这也是最基本的收纳逻辑：「人」产生需求，需求需要产品来满足，而「环境」容纳产品。所以，在讨论如何使桌面井井有条之前，首先要明白自己的生活需求有哪些。
列需求，这项工作有些像产品经理。做产品的一项重要工作是为需求排序，确立优先级。我们也要做同样的事，所以别急着漫无目的地空想，还是采用些理论更成体系——试试大名鼎鼎的「马斯洛需求层次」吧。

                    <span>谢邀。
从业30年，这问题我可能能答108条？
但是最初的，总是最难忘的。那是一切的起点……那时，我还不是漫画家。
回忆001-“画王和他的姐姐”

这幅画来自遥远的1994年，创作时间是1月，还在《雪椰》之前……那年我17。
它诞生的原因，来自我在某小学旁的小书店，发现了《画书大王》的第七期。我被封面的《龙珠》瞬间秒到，很快就买下了它。原本以为这是盗版书商学习香港杂志搞出来的盗版作品合集，但当我翻开它时，竟意外地发现它上面竟刊登着真真切切的国产漫画作品！而且，它它它……居然还接受投稿！！！

彼时一直在找寻能投稿平台的我，恨不得当场就给它跪了！
我扫荡了书店里所有的过期《画王》，回家细读。然后就发现了这个：

“先把这玩意参加咯，然后就投稿！”我这么想着，一分钟也没耽搁，立刻铺开画纸开始设计。
从小就喜欢不按规则行事的我，一口气就画下了“两个画王”。然后振振有词地在设计说明里写了老大一篇：“私以为画王不应只有一人，亦应考虑女性读者需求，所以应为其设计一位姐姐，画王11岁，姐姐14，5，既让女读者也能找到共鸣点，又能照顾年龄稍大之读者的阅读感受……至于为甚给“画王”设计姐姐而不是妹妹，是因为除年纪外尚要考虑角色个性，11岁男童要可爱合适懵懂淘气，小大人乖乖仔会惹人厌恶。而出于性格互补另一角色应温柔知性，此种性格用于姐姐身上合适……且不应互换，知性哥哥和调皮妹妹不讨喜……“
光角色说明，我当年就写了2大页吧……？也不知有没吓着《画王》编辑……
我再找出自己平常的一些习作画稿，塞了至少有个6，7页进信封；（你们懂那种年少时拿着自己上百幅自认的惊世之作恨不得全给塞进去的心情不？哈哈哈……）又另写了一封3页纸阐述自己如何喜爱漫画，吹捧《画王》，并问询如何投稿的心里话……直至把信封塞爆……
换了新信封后，我用透明胶把它给封了两层边，才出街丢进邮筒，怀着对回信的憧憬，屁颠屁颠地蹦回了家。
两周后，我竟然收到了主编大人的亲笔回信！我被告知：”很可惜，你的稿件寄到时，画王设计征集活动早已截至。因此，基于公平原则，你的设计我们不能采纳。“但是：”我们觉得你的画很不错哦！你愿意尝试画个短篇故事投稿试试吗？你需要先……“
那天，我在我的小屋里，抓着回信，高举过头，发出了青春的咆哮！
不喜欢按规则行事的我，开始了《雪椰》的策划……并在回信里给主编说：“对不起……短篇我一时没有头绪，我想了个长篇您要不要看看……？”

咳咳，作为前几天实地蹲点摸排的人员之一，在去在这里涉事人出租屋去搜查违规军服和伪造文件时，我惊呆了！震惊的主要原因是：这么假，怎么能有人信？


在这里，有必要为广大战友正名，我们现役军人是不会拍这么多个人照的（宣传干事们不要打我……），更不会在网上发布带有军种符号标志和军衔的照片。其次，兄dei，你的肩章都要歪到天上去了，“穿了龙袍也不像太子”说的就是这哥们本人了，周身气质着实与军人不符啊！还有营长，是少校配置，这一毛三有点着急啊。

还穿着常服四处剪彩，这行为也属实迷醉。因为警备纠察的范围，只能对人员身份进行核查，并调查清楚军装来源与穿着目的，对违规军装进行没收，并没有执法权，所以涉事人已经被移交给“警察叔叔”立案处理了。后续有结果，小编也会第一时间告诉大家。军人，军装不容抹黑，欢迎大家加入发现“假军人”的打假队伍。
科普一下：根据我国《刑法》第三百七十二条【冒充军人招摇撞骗罪】规定：冒充军人招摇撞骗的，处三年以下有期徒刑、拘役、管制或者剥夺政治权利；情节严重的，处三年以上十年以下有期徒刑。日子挺有判头……

由于比邻的地缘格局和相近的文化传统，东亚各国在饮食习惯上有着很多共性。比如用筷子、喝粮食酒、蘸酱油调味、吃辣椒酱、吃腌渍蔬菜、吃白米饭、吃狗肉……几乎所有被中国人打上了鲜明标签的本民族餐桌元素，都能在朝鲜、韩国、日本、越南找到共鸣。腐乳，也许是唯一的例外。






这种由豆腐腌制发酵而来的小菜，廉价、鲜美、用途广泛。同时，它还完美解决了豆制品不耐存储运输的问题，是中国各地最常见的小菜之一。但神奇的是，同样对豆腐怀有热爱的朝鲜、韩国、日本和越南，却几乎见不到腐乳的影子。不吃腐乳，他们各有理由，诸如“有异味”“高盐”“不健康”，但似乎全然忘记了异味更大的日本纳豆，与含盐量同样高的韩国泡菜。历史上与中国有着千丝万缕联系的冲绳群岛，至今倒是依然流行着一种名为“豆腐糕“的食物。和腐乳一样，它依赖发酵改良豆腐的口感。



因为豆腐糕不能太咸，所以其制作过程只能依靠酒精来控制霉菌的滋生。在加入冲绳本地烈酒“泡盛“后，大量有益菌群被杀死，这就导致豆腐糕的发酵程度不够深，空有腐乳的质感，缺乏氨基酸为腐乳带来的，爆炸般的鲜味。本质上，冲绳豆腐糕只是一种类似腐乳的点心，它远远达不到腐乳的味觉高度。究竟是怎样的土壤，成就了酵变于腐乳之中的中餐滋味、隐藏于腐乳之外的华夏风韵、搭建于腐乳之上的汉唐美学？

制造腐乳的的原材料是豆腐，并且豆腐的含水量不能太高，需要达到一定的固形物密度。日本人发明的“绢豆腐”，是无法制造腐乳的。盐卤，是制作腐乳的先决要素。



虽然这种由氯化钾、氯化镁和溴化镁等杂质构成的制盐废料，具有一定的化学毒性，经常被当成健康饮食的反面教材。但没有朴素的盐卤参与，就无法“点”出干湿适度、软硬合宜的豆腐。纵观众多历史久远的腐乳产地，诸如浙江绍兴、广西桂林、山东临清、云南楚雄、福建莆田……它们有一个共同特点…</span>

《红楼梦》里，有一段耐人寻味的场景。香菱与一群小丫鬟玩，不慎弄脏了身上的“石榴红绫”裙子，小丫头们吓得一哄而散。“妇女之友”贾宝玉留了下来，拿了袭人的同款裙子给香菱。“（香菱）接了裙子，展开一看，果然同自己的一样。又命宝玉背过脸去，自己叉手向内解下来，将这条系上。香菱拉他的手，笑道：‘这又叫做什么？怪道人人说你惯会鬼鬼祟祟使人肉麻的事。’”成年人读到这里，总会露出一脸姨母笑。袭人什么身份？和贾宝玉试过“云雨情”的通房丫头。贾宝玉拿了袭人的裙子给香菱，香菱不但不避嫌，还当着男人的面换裙子。换完了，俩人还手拉手笑嘻嘻说话，嗔怪对方“肉麻”。曹雪芹同志就差把“性暗示”三个字写在纸上了。



石榴裙，是这则故事里的关键道具。事实上，在汉语言文字里，“石榴裙”三字在大多数语境下，都带着浓郁的桃色气息。它暗藏了中国人对性事只可意会不可言传的微妙观念，以及对石榴这种水果既充满向往、又随意亵玩的矛盾态度。作为一个外来物种，石榴也许不是在中国混得最好的水果，但它一定是最能融入汉文化的水果。

根据西晋张华《博物志》记载，石榴是张骞出使西域时，从石国带回来的植物。所谓“石国”，有可能是地处南疆至中亚的古国。今天，当地许多地名里，如喀什（kashgar）、克什米尔（kashmir）、塔什干（tashkent），依然常见许多带有“石”（sh）的音节。虽然石榴是不是张骞带回的植物已经不可考，但它源自西域却是肯定的。公元前十世纪，所罗门王就在肥沃的新月地带，栽种了石榴，并且爱饮用石榴汁榨的香酒。《雅歌》甚至用石榴来形容所罗门王喜爱的姑娘：“你的两颊裹在帕子内，如同一块石榴”。

                    <span>傲慢与偏见——谈谈2021年的轻厉和轻小说
既然去年头脑一热写了那个轻厉总结帖，那今年也延续一下习惯写点字，我的能力和眼界也不足以去谈轻小说的趋势、格局这种大东西，更没资格去评价排名是否公正，那就讲讲今年轻厉前10我读过的书，还有进了前100的我觉得还行的和没有进轻厉但我私心偏爱的书吧。毕竟今年前100姑且看过48本，但感觉很多非新作或者新作里觉得只是平平无奇没特别深印象甚至“我为啥花钱买这本”的就不列了，多数书其实只是原先写的感想抄过来改改，部分觉得有必要的可能会写点感想以外的东西。反正想到哪写到哪，聊的也是和标题一样充满了纯主观的傲慢与偏见的内容，大家就当图一乐好了，如果能真的顺着这篇文章发现可能自己会喜欢的书那就太好了。
关于轻厉和协力者本身的介绍和看法在去年帖子就已经说了，所以这里就讲下今年的变化，一是协力者从去年81人扩容到96人（但去年的协力者有不少今年没续投，毕竟30+的社畜还得肝GBF打原神哪有那么多时间读书，所以通过重新招募补充了30-40人左右的新规），而且协力者的选定标准也第一次披露（年间60册或者日常在当轻小说博主管人就有资格评选），反正协力者本身也只是按照自己的喜好投票的读者，投票结果一如既往会公布，直接买本看看大家投啥就行了。二是web票必须投满5部作品，否则视为无效，造成了有效票从去年的10000票下降到了今年的6000票，不过去年本身就有约1/3票是只投了1部作品的，所以相比去年参与者也不算下降，但必须投5票的确可能导致实际上没读那么多就投点凑数的热门书就是了。废话说完，下面开始按照不分文库单行本的总排名随便写写自己看过的那些书了，如果协力者和WEB进前30了会标注下，我自己投了哪些也会标注（排名微博上有）：

飞机是怎么完成复杂的飞行动作的呢？其实这些高超的飞行表演，都和飞机的超机动性有着密切的关系。那什么是飞机的超机动性呢？
简单来说，我们生活当中开车是在二维空间里进行，而飞机是在三维空间里运动。为了进一步弄清楚超机动性，我们要先了解什么是传统的机动飞行。传统机动飞行主要是指以空气动力为升力所形成的过载完成的曲线运动。而超机动性是在空气动力较弱的区间完成的过失速机动动作。
超机动飞行可在三维空间内完成任意角度、方向的机动飞行。这就要求超机动飞行必须在能量足够的情况下才能完成。普通航空发动机提供的推力方向是固定的，而矢量推力发动机可将推力方向做垂直或水平调整，采用矢量推力用于直接推力，完成飞机的各种复杂机动动作，才能实现超机动飞行。详情点击：

在中国960万平方公里的土地上，口味差异、食材差异、烹饪技术差异，呈现出鲜明的地理适性。所谓“中餐”，很少拥有滋味和外观上的共性，更多时候代表的是基于国家认同下的广泛饮食聚落。但葱油也许是个例外：葱属植物和油脂，这两种滋味、形态、质素有巨大差异的食材，只要到了中国人手中，便成为天作之合：无论是下里巴人的葱油饼、葱油酥、葱油拌面，还是文雅内秀的葱油鸡、葱油肉，又或者是入室登堂的葱油海参、葱油鲥鱼，在加持一勺爆香的葱油之后，都成了地道的中国味儿。孤帆远影碧空尽，举国上下爱葱油。

从植物学的分类看，葱与韭菜、大蒜、薤（藠头）都是同一科的近亲。它们天然富含被称为蒜素或葱素的刺激性成分。实质上，无论蒜素还是葱素，都是由丙烯硫醚、丙烯二硫、硫醇等成分，以不同比例构成的硫化合物。嗅觉敏感的人，常常对啃过葱、嚼过蒜的人避之不及，形容对方“嘴里有屎味”。某种程度上说，这也没错，排泄物的气味里，硫化物也做出了相当贡献。出家人不能吃“五荤“，本质上是认为这些刺鼻的气味影响人的清修。



但奇妙的是，惹人嫌恶的葱素、蒜素，在受热并接触油脂后，会发生脱胎换骨的蜕变。脂肪与硫化物快速分解、结合，成为新的风味物质，脂香四溢、葱味缭绕，这是大多数人都难以拒绝的诱惑。口有同嗜，这种高度契合的食材组合，其实在全球范围内广泛存在。日本人以切碎的大葱搭配味噌汤，依靠大豆和鱼肉…</span>

                    <span>『车田漫画里需要的不是起承转合，如何让读者感到惊讶才是最重要的』
———by 车田正美



这是整个车田宇宙的核心，也是圣斗士成为经典的核心。


也许当年就真吃这套，天马行空的设定比故事本身更受关注。车田这么做了，也确确实实的做到了，打造了一个跨世纪的经典。


车田以他自己那套独创的模式开拓了一片新天地。「开头→叙述→转折→结尾」这种死板的形式，在车田宇宙里可不太常见。


各种荒诞无稽的设定，夸张的必杀，独特的战斗表现集合成所谓的『车田節』。凭借这些独特之处，堆砌了圣斗士世界。



▽
当然，光有核没有精美外壳想必也无法做到风靡世界。其中，星座的实体化无疑是圣斗士成为经典的最重要因素。


在生活中，星座早已成为如同十二生肖般的必然存在。当时，多少朋友通过圣斗士把十二星座倒背如流。


星座通过防具【圣衣】得到实体化。再配上美型男与其搭配，这是男女通杀的妙招，无一幸免。


圣衣的定位本身也是一个亮点，它增大了星座实体化的魅力！



『最初打算用日本武士铠甲型防具，战斗模式就像空手道对决那样。威力过于强大，所以需要穿戴防具。


但感觉普通的防具太土。烦恼之际，脑中突然浮现出希腊神话，觉得把防具做成星座的形状那绝对很酷。


防具定位于西洋风那种带曲线的设计。现在看来狮子座艾欧里亚的黄金圣衣，应该是最接近当初所构思的印象吧』



圣衣效仿西洋风甲胄，但未照搬样式。反倒是削弱了笨重感，进行了更贴身的改良，就像穿戴的服装一样。


动画版中的圣衣设计，更是改良得凸显了美型男的完美身体曲线。这样的视觉冲击，也是促进人气暴涨的重要因素吧。
其中，荒木伸吾与姫野美智的功劳甚大


圣衣根据等级还体现着不同的风格。而这种等级差异，车田直接用对身体的覆盖率，进行了体现。



『当初对圣斗士有个大概的年龄设定。青铜为初中，白银为高中，黄金为大学。对应身高约在165，175，180左右。


另外，圣衣的等级如同军队里的官阶。青铜为尉级，白银为校级，黄金则是将级。


一般印象中，低等兵大都穿戴像作业服那种比较短款的服装，长官级是夹克之类的，而将领级则是长款大衣那种吧。


如此，仅凭穿着就可能判断出级别。当时就是这样考虑的』


圣斗士中青铜最低级，看着也最凉快。白银稍微严实点，黄金则露出更少，神圣衣基本就约等于全身覆盖了。



虽然是防具，但圣衣更像是一种时尚。圣衣的命名『cloth』也算是回应了此特征。


似衣非衣，即使不穿戴圣衣，它依靠着星座本来的造型依然能独立炫酷的存在。这样的设计超级有魅力，即便现在也依旧拉风。


▽
如此独特的设定，没有足够大的空间，想必也难以展现出它全部的魅力。


圣斗士宏大的世界观，就为圣衣提供了一个完现魅力的『时尚平台』。圣衣在无形中仿佛拉近了传说与现实的距离。



车田用一个『超』字把众多神话串联起，所有神话被归纳成同宗。各家神话在圣斗士世界里就相当于从宗家衍生出的支派。


但在未普及互联网，信息较闭塞的当时也很难能了解到这部分内容。


而圣斗士的历史背景，其尺度远比当时所理解的要大得多得多，被称之为『大圣战史』。


》宇宙的诞生
》生命的诞生
》雅典娜的诞生
》波塞冬的初次圣战，圣斗士与圣衣诞生
》巨人族之战
》阿瑞斯的圣战
》and so on………


在正篇开始之前，还有这么一大段迷一般的历史存在。这一切在作品中基本都未提及，而是记载于此刊物中。



当了解到这一大段历史后，有种圣斗士的尺度又被放大了一倍的感觉。就是在这样一个大世界里，光芒万丈的圣衣照亮着每个角落。
《圣斗士星矢》中的众神体系是怎么样的？

▽
比起圣斗士的世界观，它的故事则显得要简单得多。但依靠这来自独特灵感的设计，依旧让此作如凤凰烈火般火红。


因为车田一直致力于让观众感受到震撼！


他破天荒的才能，对当时的观众来说也许是恰到好处。仿佛是艾欧洛斯附身，用暗影之箭束缚了世界各地观众的心。


时代在变，那份情怀却难以忘怀。那句口号依旧响彻云霄，被喊出了跨世纪的经典：


燃えろ、俺のコスモよ！

                    <span>【不要过分迎合潮流、因为焦虑改变自己。】
大学当然是用来探索、成长和改变的，但是年轻有一个弊端，就是常常回不经意走入歧途。
像我的人生是个典型的弯路合集，选错了专业，多花一年本科毕业。从错误的方法减肥，还好年轻没留下毛病。尝试了很多完全不适合自己的造型，幸好都在我做自媒体之前。
说到形象管理我真的想提醒各位妹妹，大学里很自由但也有很多杂音。特别是当你解锁屏幕打开大门，看到的都是大家对某种潮流趋之若鹜的时候，就要多问问自己：这么做是为了自己好，还是为了迎合大众的眼光。
但真正喜欢你的人关心的是你是不是健康舒服，不管你什么样子他总会在你的身上看到光芒，会温和的提醒你的错误、陪伴着你成长。只有喜欢面子的人才会不管不顾得要自己的女朋友24小时光鲜亮丽。

上到大学，在纠结要不要选班委，所以要不要选呢？
大学晚归被通报批评，没脸见人了怎么办。？</span>

                    <span>答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。
首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。
再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。
其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。
比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。

例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。
举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……
说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。

普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。
当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   
那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？

答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

请问，哪个品牌的汽车，方向盘助力做的较好，能不能比较一下？（方向盘比较轻柔，不用费太大力气。）？
为什么大部分汽车的方向盘不在中间？</span>

                    <span>Next.js is a React framework that provides a lot of useful features out of the box. One of these powerful features is API routes, which allows you to make an API/backend entirely within your Next.js application.
// pages/api/hello.js
//   requests to /api/hello return {&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Hello, World!&quot;}
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: &#x27;Hello, World&#x27; })
}

Services like Vercel and Netlify manage your API routes in a serverless environment, meaning you get a very scalable API and your code can be deployed globally. 
In this post, we&#x27;ll create an authenticated API route that looks like this:
// pages/api/whoami.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // check if the request contains a valid token
    await requireUser(req, res)

                    <span>I often find myself in the need of a very basic open/close transition in React for components like dialogs, side sheets, or dropdowns. The goto solution for a while seemed to be React Transition Group, which I never understood how to use properly. An excellent solution for animations is react-spring, but I&#x27;d consider it an overkill for a basic CSS powered open/close transition (but it&#x27;s great for animations in something like an image viewer).
This is why I’ve ended up writing my own hook: react-css-transition-hook
It is used like this:
const { isOpen } &#x3D; useMenu();
const [isVisible, props] &#x3D; useTransition(isOpen, {
  entering: &quot;transition ease-out duration-100 transform opacity-0 scale-95&quot;,

                    <span>TLDR


Accuracy tells you how many times the ML model was correct overall. Precision is how good the model is at predicting a specific category. Recall tells you how many times the model was able to detect a specific category.
Introduction
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
How to determine if your model is doing well
When to use precision or recall
Conclusion
Most machine learning (ML) problems fit into 2 groups: classification and regression. The main metrics used to assess performance of classification models are accuracy, precision, and recall.

To demonstrate each of these metrics, we’ll use the following example: We’re a mage on a quest to save the villagers from a horde of monsters. There are 100 monsters attacking the village. We’re going to use machine learning to pr…</span>

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss some patterns for organizing a global state in a React application.
Writing about how to organize global state implies that there is such a thing as disorganized state. Truth be told, there are several issues that can spring up from an unorganized, unprincipled global state.
As a basic example, the global state may contain a response payload from an API request, and it may contain some UI state about whether certain components are visible. These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.
When these distinctions aren&#x27;t made, you can run into trouble. For example, if you create a top-level property for every screen/experience, you can duplicate the storage of the API responses that support those experiences:

                    <span>Google Analytics can provide a lot of insight into traffic and about users visiting your website. A lot of this data is available in nice format in web console, but what if you wanted to build your own diagrams and visualizations, process the data further or just generally work with it programmatically? That&#x27;s where Google Analytics API can help you, and in this article we will look at how you can use it to query and process realtime analytics data with Python.
Before jumping into using some specific Google API, it might be a good idea to first play around with some of them. Using Google&#x27;s API explorer, you can find out which API will be most useful for you, and it will also help you determine which API to enable in Google Cloud console.

PostgreSQL v14 was recently released with some major improvements. Some of these improvements include enhancements for heavy workload performance, improved support for distributed workload, and security enhancements.
One of the most exciting releases is enhanced support for JSON, which will be the focus of this blog post.
Before we delve into these improvements, let’s get a good understanding of how JSON has been used in PostgreSQL. This will help us to appreciate the improvements better.
JSON was first introduced in Postgres with its v9.2 release. While it was a very exciting development, its implementation was not perfect. Postgres basically validated that the JSON to be stored is valid JSON and stored it as a text string.

This workflow builds a Java project, runs all JUnit tests, runs JaCoCo to generate a test coverage report, uses the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action to generate instructions coverage and branches coverage badges from the JaCoCo coverage report, uploads the JaCoCo report as a workflow artifact, and if the workflow run is associated with a PR it then comments on the PR with the computed coverage percentages.
The coverage badges are generated with the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator, which I have been developing and maintaining for a while now. Initially, it was strictly a badge generator, but its functionality has expanded over time to include optional support for PR checks that can be used to fail workflow runs if coverage is below a target threshold or if cover…</span>

                    <span>DynamoDB (DDB) is a compelling datastore choice for Serverless developers for a few key reasons. Dynamo offers a HTTP API, IAM Authorization, serverless pay-per-use billing, and almost unlimited scale when used properly. But there&#x27;s more to DynamoDB than a convenient way to store and fetch data for Lambda users.
If you&#x27;re new to DynamoDB and Serverless, you may not yet have come across DynamoDB Streams yet. Perhaps you have, but are a bit unclear on how to apply them to your applications. Like the OP of this twitter thread, the compelling use cases for DynamoDB Streams may not be clear to you.

                    <span>During my time as a developer I&#x27;ve created a lot of &quot;typed&quot; code. One particular issue has come up repeatedly and I finally had a moment of clarity.
Whenever I write something like this ...
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType; // ERROR HERE
  [key: string]: string;
}

... I get the following error on the commented line above.
Property &#x27;config&#x27; of type &#x27;ConfigType&#x27; is not assignable to &#x27;string&#x27; index type &#x27;string&#x27;.
The issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.
I&#x27;ve seen something like the following ...
export interface Person {
  id: number;
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
  [key: string]: string | number;
}

... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.
I came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.
This approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export type DataModel &#x3D; {
  config: ConfigType;
} &amp; {
  [key: string]: string;
};

The following code is another resolution.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType;
  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;
}

This approach has the &quot;issue&quot; that a new &quot;key&quot; could be used with another ConfigType.
As I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.
If anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.</span>

Wallpaper Engine：万众期待的动态壁纸引擎上线 Android 版

平台：Android / Windows
关键词：壁纸、动态壁纸

@Noah_Choi：想必各位玩家的 Steam 库中一定会有 Wallpaper Engine 这个强大的动态壁纸工具，它帮无数玩家美化了自己的电脑桌面、营造了一个或炫酷或可爱的娱乐氛围。不过话说回来，动态壁纸可是 Android 平台的强项，所以在近日，Wallpaper Engine 发布了 Android 版本，我们手里的手机或者平板电脑也能享受到创意工坊里无穷无尽的动态壁纸了。
使用 Wallpaper Engine 的 Android 版非常简单，它直接使用了 Android 系统动态壁纸接口，我们可以在壁纸设置中找到 Wallpaper Engine 服务，或者通过应用内设置壁纸。Wallpaper Engine 已经内置了 9 款基础壁纸，可以看作是一个基础功能展示。每种壁纸都会有一些自定义选项，例如修改配色、元素选择等等，在电脑上使用过 Wallpaper Engi…</span>

编注：如无特殊说明，以下日历产品可以直接在电商平台搜索和购买。
同福客栈日历 2022
几乎每隔一段时间，我都能听到不同的朋友说又开始重刷《武林外传》了。作为国民下饭神剧，《武林外传》的周边产业也是风生水起、热热闹闹。从原声播客到搞笑博主，应有尽有。同福客栈 2022 日历就是由 @同福客栈知识竞答 推出的。

《同福客栈2022日历》在每一天都精选了一句剧中台词，光看这文字就有画面了，难怪自称「有声日历」。所选取的句子都与当天的日期有所关联，至于到底是什么样的联系，我看必须得是《武林外传》五级学者才能真正发掘出其中的奥妙。

除了台词之外，每页日历底下还有一道知识考验。出题点都是来自剧中不起眼的一点剧情，比如「西铺米街被盗几捆大葱？」，等等…… 我竟然都不知道有西铺米街的存在？！

《同福客栈2022日历》日历页包含阴历阳历、以及星期和节假日，可以说是非常齐全了。全彩插图避开了剧中的人物与场景，不过配色鲜艳丰富，也是来自同福客栈里的各种颜色。

你可以在店铺 同福客栈知识竞答 购买《同福客栈2022日历》售价 98 元。
五金行日历 2022
中断一年后，品牌设计公司 Five Metal Shop 总算是推出《五金行日历 2022》了。

《五金行日历 2022》沿用了一如即往的高级设计。这本日历最与众不同的便是采用了大量鲜艳的配色，来自 10 种全新Pantone 颜色，包含五种霓虹色、两种金属色、两种特殊色和一种粉彩色。

它们有夜市闪烁的霓虹紫、盥洗台上的牙膏粉绿、年节餐桌上的乌鱼子红、每天追着跑的垃圾车黄。受到这些来…</span>

                    <span>前言
不知道你有没有设想过，躺在沙发上就能让卧室的电脑帮你下载想看的电影、说一句话就能让电脑打开想玩的游戏……这些看似「科幻」的操作，在智能家庭逐渐普及的当下，显然已经不是什么难事了。
不过，依赖第三方解决方案往往很难满足自身的所有需求。以我自己为例，我的 PC 作为家用游戏机，一直连接在电视上。想舒服的进行遥控，要么使用无线键鼠，要么使用远程桌面，终归费时费力。无意瞄到桌面摆放的 HomePod，开始思考能不能使用语音去进行遥控。呀，用语音进行控制 Windows 电脑，好像是个很酷的事情耶～
想到就做，但想法是美好的，事实是残酷的。就这样一个简单的需求，局限于设备平台以及系统权限，需要付出大量心血才能实现。愿意折腾的玩家或许会享受这个过程，但作为普通人的我们，就想简单快速的满足自己，那有没有好方案呢？
有的，而且很简单。下面请允许我将这个「魔法」剖析给你，助你成为家里的魔术师🪄

                    <span>Matrix 首页推荐
Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

过去的我并不认为一个足够安静的写作环境能为自己带来效率的提升——这个想法一直持续到我开始在少数派写作，然后就没有然后了。在少数派发文两个月，我逐渐意识到在写作过程中排除干扰对于保持思考的重要性。所谓「灵感」只不过是个一闪而过的念头，而抓住这个念头的难度并不比在热门视频中精准定位到一条弹幕要更容易一点——视频可以回退和暂停到进度条的任何位置，但人的想法却没有「精确回溯」这一说。既然主观上无法作为，想要更加容易的捕捉灵感，就得从客观条件的方向着手改善：在来自外界的无数干扰中，最容易被消除的当属无休止的环境噪音；而至于那些内在的杂乱想法，就只得「时时勤拂拭，勿使惹尘埃」了。
抱着如此的想法，我开始在市面上寻找一款能够满足长时专注需求的无线消噪耳机。在此之前，我曾经使用过 FreeBuds 3 及 AirPods Pro——前者在佩戴的体验上显得轻松愉快，但消噪功能的作用范围比较有限；后者的消噪效果处于该品类的第一梯队，然其悬挂入耳的设计依然会让我在使用超过三十分钟后明显感觉到耳道的「力不从心」——即使使用最小的硅胶耳塞时也不例外。当下无线消噪耳机的出货主力都是些有一定技术实力的手机厂商，这些优先适配自家硬件设备和软件生态的产品自然也会受到各种各样意想不到的限制和约束 除了 AirPods Pro 不支持 Apple Music 的无损音频，所以我将眼光投向了传统声学厂商推出的同类产品，这其中恰好有一款产品满足了我对于无线消噪耳机的全部期待——Bose QuietComfort Earbuds，通俗一点的名称则是「Bose 大鲨」。

央行解读收款二维码新规
据新华社报道，央行有关人士近日就上月发布的《中国人民银行关于加强支付受理终端及相关业务管理的通知》进行解读，针对「微信、支付宝收款码将不能用于经营收款」的说法做出澄清。该通知的主要内容之一是将条码支付纳入监管范围，对个人收款条码的使用规范做出具体规定，并将于 2022 年 3 月 1 日起施行。
根据央行说法，上述规定的背景是，此前一些商户收款使用「码牌」或者打印封装的二维码，此类「个人静态收款条码」收款安全性较低，容易被犯罪分子利用，因此要求向收款服务机构（如微信、支付宝等）申请转为商用收款码；同时，要求不得通过个人收款条码为具有明显经营活动特征的个人提供经营活动相关收款服务。
至于哪些用户属于「具有明显经营特征」，中国支付清算协会正在研究制定相关标准。人民银行有关人士表示，在相关要求实施之前，支付服务机构必须要全面、充分评估客户正常支付需求，制定配套服务解决方案，确保服务成本不升、服务质量不降。收款服务机构有义务免费为商户提供商用收款码，商户只需要提供必要的身份核实信息。来源

                    <span>汽车安全座椅在小朋友的眼中，也许是这样的：

其实在1940年前后，一小部分有车家庭就开始使用了。但如果我跟你说，当时的画风是这样的，你还敢坐嘛？

是的，那个时候它的长相和功能和现在相距甚远。严格来说还称不上是一个“安全座椅”，最多算是“汽车座椅”。

如果回到那个时代生活，我宁愿孩子们都不要坐它！因为那个时候的汽车座椅并非现在的「免死金牌」，而是一个不折不扣、骇人听闻的「儿童杀手」。
下面我就用多图来带大家看看，儿童汽车安全座椅有着怎样令人深感震撼的的百年曲折发展史。
❤️ 阶段一：座椅？打包带！
1. 啼笑皆非的早期原型
上世纪30年代能开上车的，那可真不是一般人，人们普遍认为，巨大坚硬、风雨无阻的汽车本身就是最厉害的。
当时的克莱斯勒汽车广告上俨然写着： 
 “亲爱的爸爸，你看我在100公里每小时（60迈/小时）的车上还能写字哎。” 
“是的儿子，我们现在乘坐的就是无坚不摧的钢铁大桥号。”
而且无论大人小孩，一律没有安全保护措施。

这在今天就是典型的反面教材，但那时候人们的交通安全意识基本为零。当时的汽车就算有任何安全设施，也完全不是从乘客的健全和舒适角度出发，而是为了驾驶者的方便。
比如，Bunny Bear公司在1933年发明的第一台儿童汽车座椅，只需要用绑绳捆在座位上。娃坐的高了、看得远了，注意力被转移了。大人开车也就不容易被打扰了。

到了40-60年代，家长可以花1-5刀买一个更加便携轻便的可折叠座椅。
它通常是像下面这样，用铁架子加帆布、麻布、塑料板或木箱做成的。靠两个铁钩子挂在座位靠背上，酷似一个“带钩子的内裤”。

单看乘坐的部分有点像如今的跳跳椅。不过从结构上更像一个吹风机挂篮的放大版。随意程度简直令人怀疑历史。

还有的人为了进一步增加娱乐效果，让孩子站在车座上模仿大人开车。
我们大概不需要通过撞击模拟实验也可以猜出，当意外发生时，这种挂钩座椅…</span>

                    <span>相信绝大多数职场人在平时的工作中，免不了需要参与各种规模、各种性质的会议，有团队内部的、团队之间的、跨职能、向上级汇报工作等等，如何在这些会议中能够游刃有余的有效发言，这是每一个职场人都要学的一门学问，其中很有讲究
这里对会议发言上常见的问题进行一个归类，看是否有遇到过类似经历

想说却不敢说
对 topic 不是很了解，跟不上讨论的节奏，没有办法发言，或者在场的人比较多，有一些资深的或者气场比较强的人存在，此时轮到自己发言时会语无伦次，语言能力急剧下降
敢说却不会说
发言经常被打断，等你阐述完自己的观点后，没有人对你的发言回应直接进入后面的环节或者全场雅雀没有正面或负面的反馈，试图对自己的观点补充几次后，反而自己说的重点没有了
敢说也知道怎么说，犹豫该不该讲
这种经常发生在跟上级汇报工作的场景，有的时候上司会因为缺少一些上下文，问的问题或发表的评论不一定在点子上，此时资历比较浅的人会努力的去迎合、回答解释，而不是当面指出，以此避免正面的冲突，害怕对方下不来台

要解决这些问题，首先需要明确开会的意义，以及在开会时有效发言的意义
根据会议不同的目的，可以将其分为如下 3 类：

日常例会，此类会议的主旨是在团队内同步各项目的进展，目的是找到影响工作进程的阻碍项，通过调整后续策略，以此提高团队整体执行效率
为了做某项决定而开的会，解决一些矛盾的观点，这种会议中会有不同意见直接的碰撞，目的是在会议结束时，能够让与会人都能同意某一种决定做法
征询意见的会议，集思广益来提高负责人实施方案的质量，比如在互联网公司常见的技术评审 review

会议中发言的重要性
常常听到有同学说是为了刷「存在感」，这个可能有一些片面，从侧面也反映出自身在职业发展上还没有找到突破口和契机

首先开会是一个自我学习的途径，在会议中，需要保持自己听懂或者同意会议所做的决定，这会直接影响到自己平时的工作，如…</span>

                    <span>前两天看到了网上流传的清朝的微积分课本中的几页，其中的所有数学表达式都是用中文书写的。虽然整个过程不忍直视，但还是感觉蛮有趣的。于是我打算写篇文章翻译一下这几页。[1][2]
下面我们先来看到第一页：
第一页
请您上眼。乍一看大家肯定觉得：这都啥啊？这样的公式好丑，怎么能记得住呢？而且这里面居然还有完全不认识的字？比如一个双人旁一个天念啥？
下面我就要使用魔法将这些丑丑的公式翻译成能看的懂的形式了。
在翻译之前，我们要明确的一个 大原则 是：在清朝，“分数”的“分子”是分母，“分母”是分子 。也就是说，如果看到“分数”，则我们取它的倒数就可以得到现代意义下的分数 。
提示：这条大原则全文适用 。
首先映入眼帘的是：
 
这明显是一个函数，它翻译成英语就是：
 
啊，看着舒服多啦～这道例题提到了“...求其微分之式，则可依blabla...”。害，无所谓依啥了，我们自己就可以搞定。求  这个函数的微分函数比较容易的。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
与：

做比较可以得到以下破译密码：

双人旁  
一  
长得像垂直符号的符号  
訥  

第一个公式的破译工作就完成啦～很顺利是不是！但是，下一个公式就很难破译了。没错，就是它：

这个公式，堪称我破译工作中最可(**)爱(**)的一个。先不管天啊，地啊啥的。从刚才的破译密码中我们得知的信息是 双人旁  ，于是问题就出现了这里面有  ，  以及  。咦？这么快就跳到全微分啦？但仔细不看不对啊，这跟全微分完全不沾边啊。于是我推测，这不是全微分，而是刚才例题的推广，因为我在下面的结果中看到了天的地次方：  ：

此处的天和地不能再理解为  和  了，而是应该理解为  与  ，说白了，就是对函数：
 
求导（ 这个表达简直了。。。哈哈哈哈哈哈哈）。
像破译第一个公式一样，这里我们如法炮制即可。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
将式  进一步化简可得：
 
现在我们将  除到左边之后与之前所提到的 大原则 一起可得：
 
将式  与：

做比较可得：

戍  
天/地  

这样第一页我们就完全破译啦！下面开始第二页的破译～
第二页
这一页的破译工作会异常轻松。首先我们看到了“积分”这个字眼，并且他说“啥啥（就是那个怪怪的公式），要必为简式”才可求其积分。所以我们不妨先来看看：

这是个啥？
由之前所总结的破译密码可知，天一定代表一个“变量”。而且我们还知道长得像垂直符号的那个符号等价于加法，因此我们推测：

长得像转置符号的那个符号  

而甲，乙，丙...啥的自然表示的就是常数  等等。至于寅卯午巳这些字，如果你愿意，可以定义为  等等，它们也都表示常数。因此，我们可以将其破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
同理，我们可以将：

破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
聪明的你一定发现了：

表达的就是不定积分的分部积分法：
 
破译密码为：

禾  
戌/亥  

最后是第三页：
第三页
有了之前两页的经验，相信这一页大家一定得心应手啦。在这一页中，所有的汉字数字与阿拉伯数字的含义是一致的。而天，地，人（这应该是人吧）表示的都是变量。因此我们可以设：
 
因此：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
而：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
显然，式  是式  的一个原函数。而丙上面加一个点表示的是积分常数  ，与普通的丙表示的  是不一样的（二丙，看起来像麻将）。
现在让我们看到最右边的：

这表示的显然是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
我一度认为左边是二阶导数。。。后来一想不对，如果是二阶导数的话“分母”上的二应该在双人旁后面。因此：

表示的是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
然后后面说可以将  ，进而：

表示的就是（注意 大原则 ）：

As the rules suggest, I&#x27;ll code for at least one hour everyday and share my status on social media. This will also act as a timeline blog of my journey as a Web Developer.

「时光不负，创作不停，本文正在参加2021年终总结征文大赛」
前言
又到了一年一度的年终总结，每到这个时间点,都是大家总结盘点一年的收获并立下新的一年的Flag的时候~
Flag与2021年的实现情况，并分享一些实现目标，战胜拖延症的实用方法，希望对大家有所帮助
2020年立下的Flag与完成情况

Flag就立在这里，下面我们来看下完成情况
[x] 掘金升级到LV4
[x] 做一个100以上star的Github开源项目
[x] 读几本计算机原理，计算机网络，数据结构等基础领域的书
[ ] 掌握flutter的使用与相关原理
[ ] 掌握android性能监控与优化的原理与使用
[x] 继续坚持ARTS打卡
[x] 继续坚持每周的总结与下周规划
可以看出，有些计划如期完成了，有些则不然,我感觉对于一年的长期计划来说，完成得还算不错
Flutter的学习由于决定先学习Compose于是被搁置了。而性能监控与优化，今年主要学习总结了布局优化，启动优化，内存优化等.
但还有不少内容如稳定性优化，网络优化等没有涉及到，同时感觉还有深入的空间,所以不能算完成。
2021年的收获
说实话，其实在2020年立下的Flag到底能不能实现，其实当时心里也是没什么底的，但今年一步一步走来,积少成多，的确有了一些小收获~
参加了掘金不少活动，集齐了衬衣，卫衣，搪瓷杯，抱枕等掘金周边（掘金yyds）
成功升级到掘金LV4（去年这个时候我还是个卑微的LV2）
Github拿到了大概400个Star(超预期完成)
学习并掌握了Compose的基本原理与使用，开源了多个Compose项目
读完了《图解Http》,《HeadFirst设计模式》,《深入理解Kotlin协程》等书
坚持了ARTS打卡与每周总结与下周规划
顺便打个广…</span>

                    <span>概述
之前看到 自如团队 发布的 自如客APP裸眼3D效果的实现 ，非常有趣，不久后，社区内 Android 的开发者们陆续提供了 Flutter、 Android 原生 、Android Jetpack Compose 等不同的实现版本。
很快我看到了一个好玩的评论：

既然客户端都卷成这样了，干脆破罐破摔，把 Android OpenGL 的实现版本也补齐，毕竟 图形学或许会迟到，但绝不会缺席 。
实现效果如下（图片来源），这一波属实参与到社区内裸眼3D的 客户端大满贯 了 ：
原理简介 &amp; OpenGL 的优势
裸眼 3D 原理其它文章都拆解非常清晰了，本着不重复造轮子的原则，这里引用 Nayuta 和 付十一 文章中的部分内容，再次感谢。
裸眼 3D 效果的本质是——将整个图片结构分为 3 层：上层、中层、以及底层。在手机左右上下旋转时，上层和底层的图片呈相反的方向进行移动，中层则不动，在视觉上给人一种 3D 的感觉：

也就是说效果是由以下三张图构成的：
前景
中景(文字是白色的)
背景










接下来，如何感应手机的旋转状态，并将三层图片进行对应的移动呢？当然是使用设备自身提供各种各样优秀的传感器了，通过传感器不断回调获取设备的旋转状态，对 UI 进行对应地渲染即可。
笔者最终选择了 Android 平台上的 OpenGL API 进行渲染，直接的原因是，无需将社区内已有的实现方案重复照搬。
另一个重要的原因是，GPU 更适合图形、图像的处理，裸眼3D效果中有大量的缩放和位移操作，都可在 java 层通过一个 矩阵 对几何变换进行描述，通过 shader 小程序中交给 GPU 处理 ——因此，理论上 OpenGL 的渲染性能比其它几个方案更好一些。
本文重点是描述 OpenGL 绘制时的思路描述，因此下文仅展示部分核心代码，对具体实现感兴趣的读者可参…</span>

在北京待了差不多半年，本想写北京，但其实细想，我似乎很难在北京找到一种放松的感觉。胡同的静是属于游客和大爷的，很难属于在这个城市工作的外来者。咖啡吧和下午茶是精致的悠闲，按摩不了紧绷的神经，长居城市的我们，偶尔也需要离开社交层面的部分自我，与自然进行一次近距离对话。
此外，漫步北京也许是容易的，漫步国庆却不是那么简单。于是我和朋友们选择在国庆「出逃」北京，途沿火山和草原，一路向西，到鄂尔多斯的沙漠折返，经过呼和浩特和山西大同，最终回到北京，在北京的西边画一个圈。
在北京的西边画一个圈
前期准备：自驾+住宿
越往城市边缘走，路上的风景就越多样，相比其他出行方式，自驾也许最合适来「走西口」
对比了各类租车软件后，我们最终选定在「神舟租车」上租一辆「宝沃BX5」。国庆五天的价格大概在 2640 元，平分到我们 4 个人大概是 660 元/人。这是国庆的价格，我看了一下大概在平常日价格的 3 倍以上，如果多人一起在平常日子里出游那真是很香了。
自驾过程中总共加了 2 次油，总价算到个人大概是 100+。这里要提醒大家的是，最后还车的时候记得一定要去加油站加满油，不然平台会扣除格外 100 元加油服务费。

住房上，我们有三晚住的是平常的旅店，另外一晚住的是蒙古包，都是两个人一间。出乎意料，最后每个人每天在住宿上花的价格大概在 100 元左右。下面是住宿的支出合计：

10.2 北京-草原天路-乌兰察布

革命不是请客吃饭、不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致、那样从容不迫。
但并不是所有的沃尔夫斯堡人都有这样的觉悟，他们抗拒这样的现实，所以坚定的改革派、大众集团 CEO Herbert Diess 又一次处在漩涡中心。
根据路透社消息，大众工会主席 Daniela Cavallo、大股东皮耶希、保时捷家族的代表，会在周二举办的监事会执行委员会议上讨论 Diess 的去留问题，并在 12 月 9 日前做出最后决定。这场危机距离 Diess 获得工作合同延长，雄心勃勃地发布 2030「NEW AUTO」战略，赢得改革的阶段性胜利仅仅过了 4 个月。

对于大众这种级别的巨人，大变革下的转身必然阵痛，注定不会平静。
百年未有之变局
2021 年是智能电动车继续狂飙突进的一年。国内市场新能源渗透在 9 月历史性地突破了 20%，而距离上一次突破新能源渗透率的历史性门槛「10%」，仅仅相差 5 个月。站在这波历史性的风口上，国内造车新势力三强「蔚小理」先后突破十万辆大关，0 到 1 的蜕变已经完成，并开始把触手伸向大众的欧洲大本营。

特斯拉一骑绝尘，上海工厂产能拉满，将弹药源源不断地输送到中国和欧洲市场，万亿美元的市值高过丰田、大众、通用等十余家传统车企之和。掌舵着财大气粗的大众集团，Diess 也不禁感叹，「特斯拉因为其高估值，可以无限地获得资金和资源。」
当然，大众已经是传统车企中转型电动化最积极的那一个，纯电品台 MEB 的 ID. 家族产品已经打向中欧美三大市场。Diess 可以在内部讲话中安抚大众员工，在中国，他们的电动产品第三季度销量比…</span>

                    <span>大家好，万维猫的老王又来啦。嗯，到这集为止，年番的第一个小副本结束了，也按照之前约定的，和大家聊聊这次年番剧本创作的一些想法。
矿场篇的五集在年番中属于比较短的段落篇幅，优点是铺垫不用很长，该收的线很容易收回来，节奏也会比较紧凑。从燕家堡特别篇开始全面接手导演和编剧工作以来，我就在思考和试验，真人风格的动画表现形式，对于节奏的要求显然比电视剧要快，但又不能一味的快，人物刻画和情绪渲染也很重要。所以我们会在年番中更注重人物的复杂性。比如这一集里给陈师姐加的这种欲言又止的情感，还有之前给宣乐赋予的理想主义瞬间，其实又何尝不是给韩立增加了一些情绪的锚点。
很多人物，如果你不看他，他可能就是个路人，但略微驻足，就能看到他们身上的种种线索思绪。正如出现在我们生命里的每个看似不经意的相遇，都会给我们带来无限的可能。所谓一期一会，见众生如见己，就是如此。
凡人的整体基调不能说是欢快的，终其一生，韩立都是过客，不是归人。他所探寻的，既是未知的尽头，也是存在的意义。当然，过程中的升级舔包这些喜闻乐见之事也可成为短暂的快乐源泉，但此行漫漫不知所终的未知与伤情，还有那些必将来到却无法改变的离别，才是韩立日复一日需要面对的大道无情，这与我们的一生又何其相似。
也许这就是为何很多纪元以后，身在仙界的韩天尊，还会偶然想起那个在天南山间乘舟凌水而行的黄昏，还有那盛开在漫山遍野的白色野菊花。

Adding SASS / SCSS support
Setting up Eslint and Prettier
Setting up Eslint to run automatically before every commit (via a Git hook)
Setting up Semantic Commits (via a Git hook)
Any of the above items are optional and can be skipped during the process. For example, if you are not familiar with Semantic Commits or do not plan to use it, you can skip that part and move on to another.
You may want to bookmark this article and use it as a reference when creating your projects. I will try to keep it up to date, and when I discover a new useful feature, I will include it here.
Let&#x27;s get started.

And a difference between the many programming languages you can choose from, is that they have different sets of rules for how you work with different data types. Those rules, are called type systems, or typing d…</span>

                    <span>Today, I had time to do some coding 🧑🏼‍💻 😀
I started my Saturday early, with a 6am presentation (my time) to one of our Twitter Developer Communities, in India. It was a fun run through of what’s available in the brand new version of the Twitter API, with a live demo using our Postman Collection 💻 I also took some really great questions from the folks in the live stream, so I appreciated the opportunity.
@andypiper

      
After that (and, several cups of ☕), I thought I’d have a play with something that caught my eye a couple of weeks ago - the new Glitch in Bio starter template from the great folks over at Glitch. I&#x27;d seen the news about it, and the follow-up post about the generated sites being Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and I had been keen to have a play for a few days... but Re…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s hard to maintain a state. Harder to maintain a UI. And near impossible to keep a user happy.
No matter how well you plan, disintegration always happens.
React is a well-known web UI library with a long history of state implementation. Components shape the application. But it&#x27;s a state&#x27;s job to keep it inside the sanity borders.
That is unless it drives the developer insane before achieving this goal!
We know how the seasons pass. In spring, flowers bloom. In summer, sweats run down the armpits. With autumn, leaves leave the branches. And who will forget the snowy days of winter? (Hint: People who live after global warming makes its debut!)

                    <span>Polar charts often look impressive, which makes some people think that creating them is a tricky process demanding plenty of skills and expertise. Well, I am going to debunk this myth right now! Let me show you how to easily visualize data in a beautiful interactive JavaScript Polar Chart.
Fundamentally, a polar chart is a variation of a circular graph drawn with polar coordinates. It can also work well to visualize some sorts of categorical data for comparisons, which is exactly the case I want to demonstrate now. In this tutorial, I will build a column polar chart, with the bars growing from the center of the diagram to represent values with their length.

                    <span>Time for some regular expressions! Just like with the CSS episode, we won&#x27;t use them for intended purpose, we&#x27;ll use them for programming!
Technically I&#x27;ll count this as a Sed episode.
Sed is a very simple limited-purpose programming language which supports regular expressions and some really few other things. A sed script, usually a shell one-liner, is run separately on every line of input. It&#x27;s still used in many shell scripts where one command produces some text, then sed reshuffles it a bit with regular expressions, then another command consumes it.
I don&#x27;t really approve of this style of programming, and I think you&#x27;re better off using proper script in Ruby, Python, or Perl pretty much every single scenario - it will be much clearer, actually testable, and very often more concise as w…</span>

                    <span>Javascript always has some surprises in store. for example, typeof [] return object and not array. This has historical reasons. But this can be very confusing
How can you then properly check if something is an array?
For example, you could check if the constructor is an array.
([]).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
(new Array).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
({}).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(true).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(null).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError
(undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError

As you can see this has a problem. With null and undefined a TypeError is thrown. 
You could catch this for example with a try/catch.
try {
  (undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
} catch(e) {
}

But you don&#x27;t want that.

                    <span>If the C: drive is running out of space, we can move our WSL2 file system to another drive in a few steps.
If we are using an user different than root, we need to know it, running the whoami command (WSL side):

Also we need to know the distro name and WSL version, running the wsl --list --verbose command on PowerShell (Windows Side):

Knowing the username: equiman, the linux distribution: Ubuntu, and confirm that we are using the WSL 2 version, we are ready to...

All next steep need to be done on PowerShell (Windows Side).
First we need to shutdown WSL to avoid data corruption. Close all WSL terminals that are using it and then run the wsl --shutdown command.
Next we are going to create a backup from our Ubuntu linux distribution.
mkdir D:\backup
wsl --export Ubuntu D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

Don&#x27;t worry if you not see progress indicators. This can be take a while depending how much data you have. Maybe it&#x27;s good idea take a rest.

When finish, we need to to unregister the linux distribution from C: drive. It will also release the disk space.
wsl --unregister Ubuntu

And then, import again on our new disk. I&#x27;ll use D: disk as an example.
mkdir D:\WSL
wsl --import Ubuntu D:\WSL\ D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

By default Ubuntu will use root as default user, to switch to our user (equiman in my case) we need to run this commands.
cd $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
ubuntu config --default-user equiman

Ensure replacing equiman with yours.
Restart WSL running wsl command and it&#x27;s done.
That’s All Folks!

                    <span>今年称得上是「游戏小年」，这点想必喜欢玩游戏的读者们都有同感；从去年同期到现在，整个业界尚未拿出一款投入高质量强，既叫好又叫座的高水平作品。那几款玩家们盼望已久的超级大作，发售后却接连遭遇口碑上的滑铁卢；而更多让人翘首以待的作品，全都抢着把发售档期排到了 2022 年。
不过，虽然超大型制作没能带来亮眼表现，但今年值得一玩的作品并不少。它们要么内容扎实，可以支撑你玩上很长一段时间；要么有着独特的创意和新奇的玩法，能让你体验到特别的乐趣。
每年的这个时候，都是游戏厂商们疯狂打折促销的日子，各个平台也会推出主题促销活动；有意思的是，今年 Steam 的秋季特卖还比之前延长了 1 天，12 月 1 日才会结束。
这次我们也为大家整理了一些值得入手的史低游戏，不妨趁着「黑五」特惠，用便宜的价格买下几款心仪的作品；在为今年划上圆满句号的同时，也能用一颗充满期待的心去迎接未来。
注意：不同平台的折扣截止日期不一致，具体详情请以对应平台的商店页面信息为准。
双人成行

想必这会是很多人心中的年度最佳作品之一，它拥有充满天马行空般想象力的关卡设计，以及令人眼花缭乱的各式玩法；而无论小游戏还是 Boss 战，它也充分利用了二人协作的机制，没有将这一卖点流于纸面。
本作在 Steam、Xbox 和 PS 平台上皆有折扣，支持本地双人同屏或者联网游戏。值得一提的是，第二个玩家通过「好友通行证」即可和你一同畅玩，不需要买两份。
此外，你也可以通过办理 EA Play 玩到本作。

如今市面上笔记类或者知识管理类软件太多，甚至每个月都能看见一款新产品的上线。工具本身并没有优劣，它们只是反映了工具使用者的需求和工作流。虽然不应该舍本逐末般沉迷于工具本身的研究，但依然不妨碍我们去探索和寻找新的工具来完善自己的信息管理。

来自 Anytype 工程师的邀请邮件
在产品说明会议里，CEO Zhanna Sharipova 简单介绍了 Anytype 的发展路径、当前主要功能以及未来愿景，工程师 Enda Crowley 实时展示了一些基本操作。
产品介绍 Zoom 会议（Onboarding Session）
会议结束之后，Enda 立即发送了 Anytype 的下载和对应社区邀请链接。有趣的是，本周Anytype 又推出了 iOS 测试版本。截至 2021 年 11 月，Anytype 目前支持桌面端有 MacOS、Windows 以及 Linux，移动平台有 Android 以及 iOS。

If he dies, his world is deleted. Will he survive? Yea,  because he probably wouldn&#x27;t upload the video if he didn&#x27;t. Enjoy and stay notable!

There could be more than 2 ways to implement binding adapters, but this is what I know. Let&#x27;s look at what binding adapters are first.
Binding adapter is used for implementing custom attribute in your layout file. For example, instead of using the defaultandroid:text attribute, you want to customize it by creating a new attribute app:customText.

                    <span>Introduction


Software engineering is a field that is regularly changing. Thus, developers must be continual learners to stay sharp.
However, motivating yourself to learn and creating a lasting habit can be difficult, especially if you&#x27;re self-studying outside of school or work.  Below are four techniques that I use to stay motivated while learning.
Set deadlines
Gamify
Spice it up
Identify the end goal
Learning without structure can feel like an endless task with no end in sight; it&#x27;s often nice to have a sense of progress. I&#x27;ve found that artificial deadlines give me something to work toward and cleanly mark progress.
Here are some examples of deadlines you could set for yourself:
I will study Python for 30 minutes by the end of the day
I will complete one module of my online JavaScript…</span>

                    <span>We all want to see a return on our investment, especially when creating applications, which require significant resources.
You spent money, your time, put in a lot of effort, and finally, your app is ready. Now comes the new challenge: what to charge for your app?
The decision depends on many factors. The number of working hours, testing costs, marketing and promotion, purchase of any licenses are some aspects that define the overall cost of development. Calculate the costs first, then set the price for the app.
To put an adequate price tag on your product, first, let&#x27;s look at the different pricing models.
Understanding the pros and cons of pricing models will help you choose the best option for you.
It is essential to find the balance between the price that customers are ready to pay and…</span>

                    <span>Context


Our company has organized &quot;Secret Santa&quot;, pre-covid times. I got the name of a nerdy colleague and a friend. I decided to gift him Amazon gift coupon. Like people usually do - hiding gift somewhere in desk, I instead created an online puzzle like a treasure hunt using some automation. If he solves he will receive gift on his email.
Printed a bar code on a paper and put it on my friend&#x27;s workstation desk. Upon scanning, it redirects to a simple website I&#x27;ve created using wixsite.com.
Here&#x27;s the picture of printed barcode along with other gifts -


The landing page shows following instruction -
 
To get your gift all you need is an email address.
Before I tell you more, why don&#x27;t you give a try yourself to find the email address? Here&#x27;s the link after scanning barcode - https://turantsephele.wixsite.com/giftgenerator

Once you click &quot;Get email address&quot;, it redirects you to another page which shows a timer and nothing else. And with a small hidden button somewhere in page.
If you are able to find the button and click, it redirects you to brainfuck visualizer with some pre-populated code. 
I&#x27;ve written this code in brainfuck and when you run it outputs next hint.
That brainfuck code outputs a simple string -
Decode:747572616e7473657068656c6540676d61696c2e636f6d

After decoding, it gives you the email address.
I have created a IFTTT flow which triggers when there is an incoming email with subject &quot;HOG RIEEDERRRRR&quot; and it is from my friend&#x27;s email address.
Once this condition matches, IFTTT sends an email back with gift coupon details.
Once timer ran out it reveals a link to brainfuck visualizer code.
If he can&#x27;t solve the puzzle in 3 days, an email triggers and sent gift coupon details to friend&#x27;s email address. Again using IFTTT.
That&#x27;s all folks!

                    <span>Many modern web platforms leverage on maps and location-based features to provide services to users. Some popular examples of this are Uber and Airbnb. 
With the  TomTom Maps SDK , including a map in your website has never been easier. The toolkit enables access to various mapping features including street maps, real-time traffic conditions, fuzzy search and route planning for travellers.
As a developer, you can leverage on TomTom&#x27;s APIs methods to build and customize maps in your web or mobile application.
Let&#x27;s walkthrough the process of adding a map to your website using the TomTom Maps SDK. In the end, I&#x27;ll include a link to the source code for this project for reference.

                    <span>This week I successfully published my Static Site Generator static-dodo as an NPM package.
After creating an account at npmjs.com I used the command npm login from the terminal to link my npm account.
I changed the version in package.json to 1.0.0 and also added a tag to my latest commit with:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &quot;1.0.0 Release&quot;

I then published my project using the command npm publish. 
After I made some changes to the repo, I decided to unpublish the package and start from the beginning. I decided to rebrand the project from &quot;dodo-ssg&quot; to &quot;static-dodo&quot; and publish it with the new name.
Gus McCallum tested the program on his computer by installing it with:

Linear Regression is the first algorithm in the Demystifying Machine Learning series and in this article we&#x27;ll be discussing Linear Regression using Normal equation. This article covers what is Linear Regression, how it works, the maths behind the normal equation method, fixing some edge cases, handling overfitting and code implementation.
Linear Regression in simple terms is fitting the best possible linear hypothesis (a line or a hyperplane) on the data having a linear relationship so that we can predict the new unknown data point with the least possible error. It&#x27;s not necessary to have a linear relationship in data but having such can lead to approximately close predictions. For a reference take a look at the below representation.

Eleven weeks ago when I started in Open Source Development 600 at Seneca I never thought I would get to the point of actually releasing something into the wild. Over the term we have been working on our individual static site generators. The purpose of these tools is to take a text file or Markdown file and parse it into a valid HTML document.

                    <span>Does anyone NOT use a debugger? I can&#x27;t remember the last time I did. It&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t dislike them, I just don&#x27;t need to use them. The main reason for this is because I have a certain development methodology that either produces less bugs, catches them at a unit test level, or makes tracking them down much easier.
Here are my tips...
1. Write your own COS cheat-sheet.
This is mainly for anyone that is new to COS. One of the biggest bug hazards is not knowing how certain commands and functions work. Take the time to play with a language and try out all of its variances. The process of then documenting your own cheat-sheet will cement the knowledge and provide a quick reference review tool. Not only will you become more productive, but you will certainly write less of those a…</span>

I have found that having a tangible end goal increases my odds of project completion by nearly 100%. In this case, the goal is to create a command line program that simply POSTs requests to my personal notes application engram.
This is not just a learning or for fun project as I recently realized that the command line is a great place for the input of quick notes. When I’m working, I sometimes find myself investigating something in the terminal and realize that I have a thought that I’d …</span>

本周话题：美国宪法拍卖，一个区块链案例
上周四（11月18日），美国纽约有一场拍卖会，拍卖第一版印刷的美国宪法。这件事很有意思，因为它跟区块链有关。
两百多年前，美国打赢了独立战争，13个殖民地的代表聚在一起开会，起草了宪法，决定建国。

宪法通过后，一共印刷了500份，让代表们带回各州。留存到现在的有13份，其中只有一份在私人手里，这次拍卖的就是它。


一个区块链爱好者看到了这件事。晚上在群里聊天，他随口提了一句，有人就说：&quot;我们集资去参加吧！&quot;
大伙一听，觉得很好玩，通过区块链，向全世界的网友集资，去竞标一件古董。以前没人这么干过，就让我们试试看，证明技术有这个潜力。
说干就干，他们就在区块链上成立了一个组织，叫做&quot;宪法 DAO&quot;（ConstitutionDAO），专门负责这件事，相当于项目公司。
他们注册了域名 ConstitutionDAO.com，整个网站只有一个页面（下图），解释了整件事情。

下面就是最关键的部分了，怎么才能收到钱呢？
令人意想不到的是，这反而是最容易的部分。专门的区块链工具，都已经开发出来了，在互联网上公开提供服务，可以直接拿来用。
集资服务叫做 Juicebox（下图）。它将每个项目的合约，写入区块链，并提供一个钱包接收资金。所有提供资金的人，会收到项目的代币，作为出资证明，享受相应的权益。

有了集资账户还不够，还必须让大家相信，项目组织者不会卷款跑路。大伙转账以后，组织者将这些钱转到他的个人钱包，那可…</span>

                    <span>十一月份想来都没啥节日，不过倒是有几个可能让你剁手的「消费节」——前有国内「双十一」血拼，后有国外的「黑色星期五」姗姗来迟，我们依旧整理了那些口碑不错的 App 和在线服务的相关活动，然后话不多说，先预祝大家「剁手」愉快。
这些 App 值得买
Affnity
今年，Affinity 提供了全场 7 折优惠活动，这里包括桌面应用、插件、工作手册等内容，另外针对 iPad 应用提供更为给力的 5 折优惠！对于从事图形设计、排版的用户来说，由于 Affinity 的创意设计应用均采用了一次买断制，也许是比 Adobe 更为实惠的选择。

台式机应用
支持 Windows 以及 macOS，三款套件 Affinity Photo、Affinity Designer、Affinity Publisher 分别对标 Adobe Photoshop、Adobe illustrator、Adobe InDesign，涵盖图像处理、矢量图设计以及桌面排版，但 Affinity 系列整体上要比 Adobe 套件轻量得多。

Affinity Designer（ ¥348 → ￥248）
Affinity Photo（¥348 → ¥248）
Affinity Publisher（¥348 → ¥248）

iPadOS 版 Affnity 应用
iPadOS 版的 Affinity Photo 和 Affinity Designer 拥有与台式机版同样强大的功能，其便携性非常适合将 iPad 带出去完成工作。

2021.11.26 尽量每周五更新
《瞎玩菌的游戏周报》是我对游戏领域的观察和点评。具有以下特点：

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

享乐
「享乐（yuè ）」版块是为了推荐好的游戏音乐，「享」字体现「分享」音乐和「享受」音乐两重意思。我衷心希望也许有人因为音乐从而对游戏产生兴趣（我就是）。也欢迎读者评论推荐你们喜欢的游戏音乐，我将会在后续的游戏周报中分享。

这是来自游戏《笼中窥梦(Moncage)》的原声音乐。你可以在 Bandcamp | Spotify | YouTube Music | QQ 音乐 | 网易云音乐 | Steam 收听整张专辑（共 9 首曲目），或者按名称在你喜欢的音乐服务中搜索。
要闻
「要闻」版块为你带来游戏领域最重要的话题性事件，除了展示足够丰富的细节，还有我的主观点评、吐槽或提问。游戏本身就是一种互动娱乐，我非常鼓励读者通过评论互动的方式，参与到话题中来，而不是仅仅当个「读」者。

作为 2019 年才入坑 F1 的萌新车迷，我想借本文分享一下自己的入坑经历和路径推荐。如果有小伙伴因为近期大热的中国车手周冠宇而对 F1 产生了一点兴趣，可以通过这篇文章更快地进入 F1 的世界。我也会在文中简单介绍一下目前的 F1 格局和规则，老车友亦可温故知新。
引言
随着周冠宇加入 F1 阿尔法罗密欧车队的消息正式公布，史上第一位来自中国大陆的正式车手将要征战下赛季 F1 的新闻一夜刷屏。在关于中国车手的讨论中，有人为华人在赛车领域的成就而喝彩，也有部分网友质疑他是花钱「买」位置、「带资进组」等，引发了一些争议。
那么，对于一个不了解 F1 比赛的人来说，这个坑到底值不值得入呢？
我们还是先了解一下，F1 到底是啥比赛，以及好看在哪儿。
F1 是什么？看点在哪里？
很多小伙伴一听到 F1，基本第一反应就是舒马赫和法拉利，毕竟这是 F1 几十年历史中最为成功的车手和车队。但除此之外，大部分非爱好者就了解不多了，可能只会偶尔在体育新闻里零星听到过奔驰车队夺得几连冠、刘易斯汉密尔顿拿到个人第 100 个大奖赛冠军之类的新闻。
F1 是什么比赛
F1 全称为 Formula One，中文名叫一级方程式赛车，是一个由 国际汽车联盟 举办的最高等级的 赛车 比赛。名称中「方程式」是指一组所有参赛车辆都必须遵守的规则。F1 一年为一个赛季，包括一系列二十多场大奖赛（Grand Prix），每场比赛的结果算入积分系统并以此确定两个年度世界冠军：一个颁予车手，一个颁予车队1。
F1 被很多人认为是赛车界最重要的赛事，同时也是最昂贵的体育运动…</span>

OPPO 新品发布会

OPPO 于 11 月 25 日正式发布全面升级的人像视频手机 OPPO Reno7 系列手机，新机前置猫眼镜头采用了和索尼一同研发的全新 RGBW 传感器——IMX709，从根本上提升感光能力，传感器逻辑层上内置 OPPO 自研硬件级 IP 即 RGBW 图像处理单元，同时采用DTI像素隔离技术，显著减少了像素之间的信号串扰，从而有效提升信噪比，避免偏色、伪色等现象，这使得该机目前成为了前置摄像头感光能力最强的手机，相对 Reno6 感光能力提升 60%，同时画面噪点降低 35%。且得益于硬件级 DOL-HDR 功能支持，IMX709 具备更强的动态范围能力，在暗光、逆光环境下对人像细节的捕捉和呈现比传统 RGGB 传感器也更具优势。

后置镜头部分则搭载 OPPO 与索尼联合开发的 IMX766 旗舰级主摄，带来更丰富的拍摄玩法，人像模式 2.0 能够实现接近单反的人像虚化和光斑效果，开启 AI 场景增强后能根据暗光、逆光等复杂环境下，自动调用月光夜景算法与 Live-HDR 算法，深度还原人脸肤色与背景。

工艺上首次将航天级光刻工艺应用于手机后盖，通过激光显影技术在晶钻工艺基础上二次光刻，形成 120 万道细密光栅纹理，让玻璃后壳具备流星雨般的视觉观感和立体触感。在机身正面，Reno7 系列采用行业领先的极窄边框工艺，将屏占比提升至 92.8%，镜头模组上引入光纤热弯工艺，将 1mm 直径的光纤环绕主摄系统一周形成呼吸灯效果，并采用陶瓷彩镀镜圈，实现光哑一体设计，将主摄镜头的防刮耐磨性能提升至普通金属的 10 倍。

硬件配置上，Reno7 Pro 和 Reno7 分别搭载天玑 1200-MAX 和骁龙 778G；前者为游戏玩家带来了 90 FPS 极限稳帧、超级闪电启动 2.0 和全场景网络优化，内置 4500 mAh …</span>

                    <span>写在开头的话
其实早在情报贴放出来的时候，讨论群里面关于人吃人的话题早已吵翻天了，但是直到看到完整的漫画正文，笔者收获到的却是一份更为沉重的感悟，米二真正想告诉读者的并不是吃人肉这种猎奇向的噱头，而是探讨长生不老之人如何做到对”初心“的坚守。

初心，也就是笔者之前在其他分析文中提到过的”道“。如果有兴趣的读者可以回去看下笔者关于”道“的分析。在此就不多做赘述了，开始本期的分析。
如何看待无根生的“道”
一、长生不老的诱惑
在中西方各个文明圈中，“长生不老”都是一个永恒且共通的话题。古今中外都有无数的人为之疯狂，希望去寻找答案。古人寻找修仙之法、寻找灵丹妙药；现代的科学家探索细胞分裂，研究人类的基因，也寄希望于能够找到永生的答案。
东方求长生
自古就有所谓当了皇帝想成仙，我真的还想再活五百年之类的愿望。
《太上纯阳真经·了三得一经》：“天一生水，人同自然，肾为北极之枢，精食万化，滋养百骸，赖以永年而长生不老。”
从秦始皇派徐福出海寻找蓬莱、瀛洲诸仙山上的仙人，欲求长生不老药为开端。而其后二千多年的帝王们，在追求长生不老药这件事上献出生命者络绎不绝。
汉武帝刘彻在追求长生不死的帝王队伍中也是“出类拔萃”的一位，甚至比秦始皇嬴政还疯狂。汉武帝追求长生不死在《史记·武帝本纪》中有很多篇幅。几乎一半的篇幅都在讲汉武帝终其一生如何宠信方士，如何劳师动众追求仙药。[1]
唐太宗，这又是一位千古一帝，历史上有名的明君，但也一心追求长生不老。唐太宗曾嘲笑过秦始皇和汉武帝，说秦始皇想求长生被方士骗了，说汉武帝求神仙，把女儿也嫁给了方士。可惜没想到的是晚年的唐太宗也迷恋上了长生不老，长生不死，甚至还被所谓的“不老神药”毒死。新旧唐书和资治通鉴都有唐太宗晚年食丹药的记载，类似吃长生不老药。史料记载，“服胡僧药，遂致暴疾不救”。[2]
跟唐太宗一样，嘉靖皇帝也迷恋长生不老，长生不死，大量服食丹药。…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched but even though it has been 6 years since the release of Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is STILL making the same mistakes. It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. 

I saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.

Halo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. 

So again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release

Landing your first engineering role after getting a degree in computer science (or software engineering) is a challenging process. 
There are so many software engineering vacancies, but a significant majority of them are for those with at least 2+ years of experience. There are not enough junior positions on the market, so the competition for entry-level roles is high. Yet, it is still possible to land an engineering role, even without experience. 
The following tips are mainly dedicated to computer science or software engineering graduates looking to land their first engineering role. However, self-taught developers and boot-camp graduates can still benefit from this article.
I&#x27;m going to list five actionable steps that I hope can help you land your first …</span>

Testing it: check the console in inspect to see how it increments and decrements.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.
Displaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.
In this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.
The procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.
The first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.
When you move it, you can paste this code for the script:
GIT&#x3D;&#x60;xcrun -find git&#x60;
GIT_REV&#x3D;&#x60;${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD&#x60;
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c &quot;Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}&quot; &quot;${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}&quot;

In the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.
Now, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.
To display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:
let revision &#x3D; Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: &quot;REVISION&quot;) as? String 

In Objective-C we would do it like this:
NSString *revision &#x3D; [NSBundle.mainBundle objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@&quot;REVISION&quot;];</span>

                    <span>Hello coders!
This article presents an open-source Flask Dashboard crafted with authentication, database, and Docker support on top of Azia Admin, a colorful dashboard template. The product can be used to prototype fast a new dashboard on top of the existing codebase. For newcomers, Flask is a leading framework written in Python used to code from simple websites to microservices, APIs, or complex eCommerce solutions. 
Thanks for reading! 
👉 Flask Azia Admin - product page
👉 Flask Azia Admin - LIVE Demo

Azia Dashboard is a beautifully designed admin template featuring a fine selection of useful Bootstrap components and elements. The pre-built pages of the templates are intuitive and very well-designed.
Azia features many essential utility classes that can help cut down CSS bloat and modify CSS components instantly.
The product requires a minimal programming kit to be present and properly installed in the workstation in order to clone and compile the sources:
Python3 - the language that powers Flask
GIT - used to download the sources from Github
A modern editor like VsCode or Atom


Docker - (optional) for an automatized setup
Probably the most easier way to use the product is via Docker, a popular virtualization and containerization software.
👉 Step #1 - Download the source code
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-azia-dashboard.git
$ cd flask-azia-dashboard

👉 Step #2 - Start in Docker
$ docker-compose pull   # download dependencies 
$ docker-compose build  # local set up
$ docker-compose up -d  # start the app 

Once all the above commands are executed, we should see the starter running in the browser at the address http://localhost:85

                    <span>Storecle is a neat uni-directional app state management for React and Solid (❤️).
Storecle uses a simple mental model which lets you access app-wide actions and their results by using Context API.
To improve the code re-usability, Data Suppliers use a middleware pattern. They are executed in the order you specify and pass a snapshot of Store from one to another, letting you split the logic into small, specified functions.
It works with both React and Solid (it&#x27;s framework agnostic to certain degree).
It uses Context API and useEffect / createEffect to provide action re-triggers based on specified Store changes.
It facilitates splitting the business logic into granual, re-usable functions by applying a middleware pattern.
It simplifies naming and reduces noise by letting you access action r…</span>

                    <span>Now we are going to learn how to create a Nodejs and express CRUD application. A CRUD application is the simplest web  application that we can create. The term CRUD comes from  &quot;Create,&quot; &quot;Read,&quot; &quot;Update&quot;, and &quot;Delete.&quot;  We create CRUDs Applications using the HTTP Verbs. In this tutorial we are also going to learn how to connect and use  a MongoDB Database in a Nodejs application. In this tutorial we assume that you have some JavaScript knowledge.

I am a backend software engineer in N26, Barcelona office. In N26 we use kotlin and we build microservices, as you can imagine, to run the digital bank.
We were working on a backoffice microservice, that somehow handled some data about our customers and exposed some endpoints to change them (like a CRUD but not exactly).
So I cannot tell the problem using the same data because those are privileged, but I can explain the same problem using a simpler example.
Suppose you have a model in your application to store information about a Person:
data class Person(
 val name: String, 
 val address: Address
)

data class Address(
 val streetName: String, 
 val number: String, 
 val city: String

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin. Today, I&#x27;d like to talk about my experience of publishing my static site generator to NPM. It&#x27;s quite a fun experience as I finally made my project up and running in public.
I&#x27;ve used this as instruction to publish it to NPM.
You can check it out here
Because I already built my project for quite a long time so, I can skip most of the steps, and just focus on this step and some steps that help me understand the semantic versioning and dist-tags. 
When I first start using command line npm publish to publish the project, I had to sign up and log in to NPM. But I encountered an error where it said something like this
npm ERR! code E403

                    <span>If you were building an application consisting of a user interface and an API, what technology choices would you make and why?
I&#x27;ll go first.
1. TypeScript
2. React &amp; Next.js
React is a battle-tested library for building UI&#x27;s. It has good documentation and a large community. There are so many components already implemented and ready to use, so you don&#x27;t have to build everything yourself.
Next.js has been around for only a couple of years, but it is already one of the most popular tools in the React ecosystem. Next.js offers you so much out of the box. SSR, file-system-based routing, has the potential to improve metrics such as time-to-first-draw (TTFD) and so much more...
3. PostgreSQL or MongoDB

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but I fall asleep every time I’m trying to read typescript documentation. There is something in the way it is written that signals to my brain that I should not even attempt to comprehend it until I had a good night’s sleep, three coffees, and ideally some chocolate to stimulate the brain cells. I think I now found my purpose for the next few months: I want to re-write typescript documentation in a way that is actually understandable by a casual reader 😊
Let&#x27;s start with one of the pain points many developers are struggling with: generics! And we’re going to start with a bottom-up approach: let’s implement a component without generics, and introduce them only when we need them.

AWS CodePipeline helps in orchestrating CI/CD pipeline all the way from building and testing to deploying applications, from development to production environments.
However, one of the limitations of AWS CodePipeline is its inability to dynamically execute or skip any pipeline action.
This post demonstrates how to setup a CI/CD pipeline to dynamically orchestrate and execute actions based on inputs
This solution uses the following AWS services:
AWS CodeCommit – Source Control
AWS CodeBuild – Build System
AWS CodePipeline – Continuous Delivery
AWS Step Functions - Workflow automation using state machines
A change or commit to the code in the CodeCommit application repository triggers CodePipeline with the help of a CloudWatch event.
The pipeline downloads the code from the Co…</span>

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve just studied html, css and basic javascript and are starting with some framework that uses node, like react, you may have some doubts about managing dependencies. 
So let&#x27;s take a look at some useful commands and get rid of the fear of play with package.json!
First, let&#x27;s create the package.json file using the following command in the terminal:
npm init -y
With this command, we generate a standard package.json file like this:
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;project-name&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;
}

When working with node, some dependencies are used for development purposes and others will remain until the end. So we will have two…</span>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shifting recruiting from a human to largely computer-based process. AI is being used to assist HR in the entire process of candidate selection — from curating job descriptions to conducting early-stage interviews. While this can greatly reduce the number of applications that employers shift through, some have voiced legal and ethical concerns when it comes to AI-based recruiting.

很多读者都会好奇少数派的编辑们到底平时都「买了啥」。我们希望通过「编辑部的新玩意」介绍编辑部成员们最近在用的新奇产品，让他们自己来谈谈这些新玩意的使用体验究竟如何。

@北鸮：华硕 ROG 游侠 RX 光学机械键盘

购买渠道：淘宝自购
入手价格：649 元

和手感显在、特点鲜明的段落轴相比，线性轴体之间的手感差异就非常微妙了。除去按键时能直接感受到的压力克数的差别，线性轴的手感差异还体现在弹簧回弹速度（一定程度上决定了轴体是否「跟手」）、轴心稳定性（影响按在边角处的力度变化）、材质和模具精度（会影响轴体的声音与顺滑程度）等等。我自己很爱线性轴，一直希望用上一个压力克数不高、高速回弹、轴心稳定性极好、还能超级顺滑的轴体——其实我也没这么龟毛，是个线性轴我就能用，但之前能最接近我个人所有手感需求的轴体，只有我自己换了更轻的双段弹簧、全面润滑的、新换完模具的樱桃黑轴。我自己都嫌麻烦，这么折腾出来够拼一把键盘的轴就给我累个够呛，发誓再也不弄了。
之所以看上这把 ROG 的光轴键盘，是因为它搭载的 RX 光轴在许多个键盘评测视频里被称作「最强量产线性轴」，作为一个线性轴爱好者，我一直盯着它却不忍心下手。一号那天，ABS 键帽版的游侠 RX 突然从 899 降到了 599，新的 PBT 键帽版本也只要 699 元（我找到的 649 价格已经卖没了）——光这套替换键帽本身就要 200 块，看见这个价格，我想都没想，直接下单。
超长的左 Ctrl 是主要特征
朋友们，到手试机的一瞬间，我就明白之前 ROG 那只大眼睛收来的税都用来干吗了。
ROG 自研的 RX 光轴用了火山口的结构，中置 LED，这样的结构上次见到还是在被我喷得狗血淋头的罗技自研的 Romer-G。Ro…</span>

                    <span>随着感恩节而来的，就是黑色星期五了。这被等同于「海外双十一」的购物节即将来临，不知道你海淘的心有没有荡漾起来？我们挑选了一些数字生活圈子里面一些叫得上名字的东西，看看它们在黑五期间有怎样的折扣和优惠～
智能手机
Google Pixel
Google Pixel 近年以来的热度可以说是只增不减，从它在少数派新玩意栏目的出现频率，已经是可见一斑了。凭借 Google 神一般的优化，Google Pixel 利用并非出色的硬件达到了相当令人满意的流畅度与智能体验，同时整体的机身设计也常常是令人称赞。当然了，整个 Pixel 系列的拍照表现也一直是手机摄影界个中翘楚，而且大陆也没得买，所以 Google Pixel 也成为了海淘手机时很多人的首选。
Pixel 6

Pixel 6 尽管上市不久，但是其亚马逊海外购的价格已经开始下降。如今，128 GB 版本的黑色 Pixel 6 在 亚马逊海外购 已经是 4329.17 元的价格（预估税费为 399.29 元），从英国发货。除了发货时间比较长（1-2 个月）之外，这个价格本身已经是比较合适的价格了。Google Pixel 6 采用 Google 自研的 Tensor 处理器，尽管在实际性能上可能比不过 Snapdragon 888，但是在 Google 的调教下，Android 12 的流畅度是自不用说的。
Pixel 5a

Pixel 5a 本身相对于 5G 版 Pixel 4a 的升级并不大：高通骁龙 765G、6GB RAM，在流畅使用上基本不会有什么问题，主要在续航上有了不小的改进。如今在 Google Store，黑五折扣的情况下，Pixel 5a 的价格还下调了 50 美元，来到了 399 美元；但是需要找到靠谱的转运才能够购买。在 亚马逊海外购 上，Pixel 5a 的价格是 3720 元（预估税费为 372.…</span>

                    <span>1Password 在少数派绝对算得上是一个「多数派」。作为一款 2006 年发家于 macOS 平台的密码管理应用，可以说是引领着同类应用发展的「老大哥」。然而这位德高望重的老大哥却在今年「翻车」了，如果你还不清楚前因后果，可以 点击此处 了解。
在这样沸沸扬扬的争议声中测试了半年，开发团队终于正式发布全新的 1Password 8 版本（8.4.0），不知是亟待 Windows 用户认可，还是 Electron 框架真的高效，首次面向大众的竟然是 Windows 版本（macOS 现在处于 公开测试阶段）。怎么说也是三年磨一剑的大版本更新，不如让我们将主观印象先放一边，来看看 1Password 8 到底带来了哪些变化。
界面风格统一，更活泼多彩的外观设计
以往应用评测都会把不同平台区分清楚，以免造成混淆，但由于 1Password 8 统一使用 Electron 编写 UI，Windows 版和 macOS 版几乎是从一个模子里刻出来。除了窗口三键位置默认不同，以及 Windows 版将 macOS 版集成在系统菜单栏中的功能移到了左侧栏右上角的「…」中，其他 UI 设计和交互逻辑不能说十分相似，只能说完全一致。想想自己一篇评测能当两篇用，忽然理解 AgileBits 为什么死磕 Electron 了（并不是）。
开发者介绍文档从「全新」的锁屏开始，那我们就如他所愿。1Password 8 锁屏将 7.X 上下打开的解锁动画改回了更早的左右开启，并增加了用户头像，以后与你密切相关的不再是各种「独立库」，而是绑定订阅账号，从这个界面似乎就能读出开发者的更新方向。

解锁后的主界面，新版依旧保留了三栏设计，最左侧是分类目录和管理项，第二栏是项目清单，第三栏则是具体的项目数据和功能服务。新版相较于此前布局更宽松，清扫了一些划分空间的线条，还加入各种彩色小图标，尤其是「新建项…</span>

在 文科博士生眼里的资料管理、阅读和笔记系统 中我介绍了我的笔记系统的搭建，然而在具体的实践中如何进行操作呢？这次我想就阅读和写读书笔记的阶段，分享一下个人的经验。
读书习惯的养成
作为研究者，每天读书写作搞研究就是本职工作了，然而想要维持日复一日地读书写作可并不是个容易的事情。尤其在状态不好时，长时间没有产出时，被研究内容折磨地头秃时……我想如果作为纯粹作为兴趣爱好的读书学习，可能更容易坚持吧，但却可能更难达到更高深度和更大强度。
为什么我们都知道读书学习对我们人生的重大意义，却难以持之以恒呢？《掌控习惯》(Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break, James Clear, 2018) 这本书告诉我们是时候正视作为一个普通人类的好逸恶劳，好易恶难的本性，这样才能通过策略来帮助自己成为自己想成为的人。而这本书中给我们提供一些建议是：设置良好的工作环境，减小任务难度以降低阻力等。
这些建议应该如何运用到读书学习这件事上呢？我的方法是：

将读书学习的任务切分为一两个小时内可以完成的小任务。譬如在内容上将一本书切分成章节，每个章节是一个任务；在过程上切分读书、做笔记、整理复习等步骤，每个步骤是单独的任务。eg：阅读《xx》书 xx 章；整理《xx》书 xx 章笔记；复习并总结《xx》书 xx 章。
根据任务的性质，为每个任务的顺利实施创造良好的环境。
为每个任务分配时间，根据日程为每天分配任务。至少分配并完成一个，对此进行打卡记录，长期坚持形成习…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是沈乐平导演。今天我们《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》正式上线了，今天正好是感恩节，在此首先感恩大家的关注，也和大家做一番交流。很多人关心，我们为什么会在这个时间点推出《秦时明月》的十五周年版？我想说，最主要的原因正是感恩和回馈。
熟悉秦时明月和玄机的观众都知道，这次的秦时明月十五周年版其实已经是秦时明月第一部的第二次重制。百步飞剑到目前已有三个版本。每一次的重制，我们都将其当作对长久支持我们的观众和粉丝的一份礼物和回馈。


其中一个很重要的原因，是我们发现很多月饼不仅自己会经常回顾这部作品，也会向身边的朋友推荐这部曾带给他感动和启发的作品；但确实15年前制作这部动画的技术，从模型的精度甚至到画面的比例，和今天比已不可同日而语。所以这次的秦时明月十五周年版，我们用现在所掌握的最新技术进行了全面优化，以期给大家呈现全新的面貌。通过这些版本的比较，相信大家也能看出玄机在大家支持、鼓励和鞭策下，不断前进，努力做更好的自己。

秦时明月对于玄机的意义是非凡的。应该说玄机在行业中很长一段时间属于比较独特的公司——整整十年时间只做一部作品秦时明月。这一方面是因为行业发展和团队发展的阶段性；但另一方面，通过这样一段时间的沉淀和团队经验累积，我们也更深刻的理解“十年磨一剑”这句话的意义。我们觉得自己很幸运，能够在15周年的时候，有机会和能力再一次重新打磨这部作品。大家可以看到，这部作品相比原来的版本是一个脱胎换骨的升级——从每一个道具、场景的模型，每一个分镜还有动画，包括光影的处理，实际上都是全新的制作。

十五周年版我们内部专门成立了一个极致动画部，主要聚焦动画的表现，如口型、表情、布料物理运算的提升。十五周年版加强的并不是我们已经受肯定较多的场景、建模和光影特效等方面，主要加强的是角色表演的生动性、细腻度和流畅性。这三方面其实不仅仅在角色，更是一个全方位的体现，比如场景，大家可以看…</span>

Several months ago, I took on a large project at work. In summary, my task was to:
Migrate the data within ~25 columns from one table, and split them between 2 new tables. There were over 650,000 discrete records that would be affected.


Update all related business logic within dozens of files in the backend, so that they read from the 2 new ta…</span>

                    <span>The cool thing about having an entrepreneurial-related podcast is that I get to speak with very knowledgeable people inside the startup and bootstrapping world.
Arvid Kahl is a multi-talented business professional working as an expert software engineer, a successful entrepreneur, and an energetic writer. And here are the 9 lessons I got from our interview:
The audience-first approach is a much more effective way of gaining success in your venture.
It involves finding a niche or a problem prevalent in an existing target market and creating a product for it.
It is imperative that you understand whom you are creating products for, what their critical problems are, and how your product can solve those problems. 
Every bootstrap founder needs to research the market before starting the project.

                    <span>What is JavaScript?


JavaScript, is also known as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
Vanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.
JS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.
JavaScript can be used for the following:
 Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.
 Creating web and mobile applications.
 Building web servers and developing server applications.
 Game Development
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.
 TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.
 TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.
 JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.
 TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn&#x27;t need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.

The benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:
 Supports Class and Modules.
 Static Type-checking
 ES6 Feature Support
 Clear Library API definition.
 Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.
 Superset of JavaScript

As TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.</span>

                    <span>For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There&#x27;s a global crypto object that&#x27;s available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
&quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you&#x27;re on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&quot;crypto&quot;);
randomUUID(); // &quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;

It&#x27;s cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!
You can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.</span>

                    <span>Bit of a late blog this week. I was deep into some coding until late last night, and then got absolutely flattened by my body&#x27;s immune response to the COVID booster I received around lunchtime. I went from fine to feeling sicker than I&#x27;ve been in a long time in the span of about five minutes. I&#x27;m taking a sick day from work today, and with two more days off for the Thanksgiving holiday, I have plenty of time to lay around and recover. Maybe I&#x27;ll get some solid learning in, too!
This past week started with a whimper: some personal frustrations boiled over and I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot done for a couple days. However, some long days on the tail end of the week helped me regain momentum.

                    <span>之前推送了很多大厂分享，很多同学看完就觉得，大厂输出的理论知识居多，缺乏实践。
那这篇文章，我们将介绍一个大厂的库，这个库能够实打实的帮助大家解决一些问题。
今天的主角：初学者小张，资深研发老羊。
三方库中的 bug
这天 QA 上线前给小张反馈了一个 bug，应用启动就崩溃，小张一点不慌，插入 USB，触发，一看日志，原来是个空指针。
想了想，空指针比较好修复，大不了判空防御一下，于是回答：这个问题交给我，马上修复。
根据堆栈，找到了空指针的元凶。
忽然间，小张愣住了，这个空指针是个三方库在初始化的时候获取用户剪切板出错了。
这可怎么解决呢？
本来以为判个空防御一下完事，这会遇到硬茬了。
毕竟是自己装的逼，含着泪也要修复了，我们模拟下现场。

                    <span>一年一度的黑色星期五促销已经开始了，各大海外电商纷纷推出了自己的优惠措施，不知道刚刚经历双十一的血雨腥风的你还有多少力气来参战这场购物节。少数派的作者们推荐了一些正在促销的购物平台，为你的海淘提供一些参考。
亚马逊海外购
🔗 网站链接 &gt;
@鹿额：虽然亚马逊中国内地的电商业务在 2019 年已经停止运营，但其中专营跨境电商的海外购业务依然保留了下来。目前，亚马逊海外购的商品品类囊括了服装、计算机、美妆、玩具等等 12 大类，主要由海外的亚马逊美国/英国/日本/德国负责销售并直邮中国内地，并且在「黑色星期五」期间会有不小的折扣。

相比于自己亲自海淘或是进行转运，亚马逊海外购的一大优点便是相对更加省心，因为购物过程中无需顾虑支付和转运上的一些问题。一些经常海淘的朋友可能曾遇到过这样的情况：在某些美国的品牌官网或是电商网站进行购物时，商家出于一些因素的考虑会对由中国大陆发行的信用卡支付的订单、信用卡账单地址与运输地址不一致的订单或是商品运输地址明显为转运仓库地址的订单进行「砍单」处理，从来带来一些不必要的麻烦以及时间成本。

使用亚马逊海外购则无需担心上述问题，亚马逊网站会在商品详情页清楚地标注商品由哪个国家的亚马逊发货，同时在显著的位置标识商品价格、预估进口税费、预计送达日期区间、是否支持无理由退货等信息，下单付款后等待收货即可，除了商品国际运输所花费的时间稍长（通常约为 7-14 天）、售后服务凭订单收据进行外，其他体验与从国内电商平台购物并无太大区别。
值得一提的是，亚马逊海外淘的预估关税采用「多退少不补」的原则，结算时支付的预估关税如果比实际关税高，亚马逊后续会提供退款，结算时支付的预估关税如果少于实际关税，亚马逊则不会再额外要求你补款（至少我们目前没有遇到过这种情况）。
另外如果你是亚马逊的 Prime 会员或者订单金额满 300 元，运费也可以得到豁免。

在支付…</span>

                    <span>每天睡好觉真的很难做到，除了从自身角度进行身心平衡，解决病理性问题之外，床品体验也非常重要，枕头更是尤为重要。一只好的枕头会给内心带来扎实的安全感，舒服到身心完全释放。想必挑选到合适枕头的人应该都有过这种感受吧，特别是刚刚换上它的第一晚，那种体验上的升华，扑面，啊不，扑颈而来的幸福感，有一种一夜暴富的喜悦感，后悔它没有早点来。
☁️ 挑选枕头的维度
为了满足不同人群对于枕头的不同需要，挑选枕头需要考虑很多方面。市面上真的有很多种枕头供大家选择，完全不用担心找不到买新款可能比不过自己床上的陈年旧枕。比如从枕头的特性来说，有软硬度的差异，枕头高低的不同，丰富的枕头材质同时还能满足更多体验上的需求。除此之外，还有贴心的细节加以辅助，比如添加抗菌成分或者面料更亲肤，透气性好，睡起来不热等。枕头的材质也有很多讲究，有些人对羽毛过敏会选择乳胶枕、软管枕或者记忆枕，有洁癖的人会更倾向于挑选容易清洗的枕头等等。
众所周知，挑选一款适合自己的枕头，要用自己的喜好和身体的真实感受去匹配枕头的基本情况。人的感官不尽相同，也就需要考虑不同枕头能带来的不同特征。
我把枕头的基本特征分成了以下几个维度：

尺寸——正常情况下，至少要比肩膀宽一些。太小的枕头翻身就会超过它，无法支撑颈部，影响睡眠质量和安全感；
高度——根据身材体型（身材胖瘦、肩膀宽窄以及颈椎的生理弧度等），加上自己对高度的习惯挑选，更贴合自己的颈椎曲度和肩颈空间。更合适的枕头应该贴近肩部，和头颈充分接触；
软硬度——主要考虑是否处在自己舒适的感官范围，也可能会影响枕头的支撑度和对头颈肩的包裹力；
支撑度——支撑度对颈椎尤为重要，办公室久坐的朋友或者颈椎已经出现问题的人，都需要额外注意枕头对颈椎的支撑度。支撑度要认真感受枕上后对颈椎的支撑力是否足够，以及是否可以持续提供支撑，不会因为时间和压力改变而塌陷变瘪，失去支撑力。
材质——是需要综…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 11 月 17 日，Apple 宣布了一项新的服务：Self Service Repair（以下简称自助维修）。
根据 Apple 发布的 新闻稿， 该计划将从 2022 年初开始在美国率先启动，并在 2022 年或更晚推广到其他国家。届时，将允许顾客从 Apple Self Service Repair Online Store 上获取 Apple 原装零件与工具，自行修理设备。除此之外，消费者也可以将更换下来的受损零件交给 Apple 进行回收，并且获得一些鼓励性的购买补贴，将自助维修和 Apple 整体的环保计划进行了一次结合。
至于该计划覆盖的设备范围，Apple 称该计划将首先应用于 iPhone 12 与 iPhone 13 系列产品，搭载 M1 芯片的 Mac 电脑也将很快加入。但是另外两条重要的产品线——iPad 和 AirPods 系列并未被提及。（从它们的结构设计和第三方拆解的结果来看，我猜测这是因为 Apple 还不愿放手让顾客自行维修易弯的 iPad 和容易出现奇妙小问题的 AirPods。）
不出意料，消息发布后引起了热烈的关注和讨论。有观点认为，Apple 这项态度上的「大转弯」是在提前应对美国呼声渐响的「维修权」（right to repair）立法趋势，以及监管机构不断增加的压力。
本文不意在对 Apple 此项变化的动机作出推测和评论，而是想从我作为一个维修爱好者的角度，尝试分析这项服务推出后，对于维修市场和个人用户可能造成的影响。
Apple 是怎么把 iPhone 变得越来越难修的？
众所周知，Apple 曾经对于「维修」这件事的态度并不好——准确来讲，是对于「不经过 Apple 的维修」不友好——这件事甚至从上世纪八十年代便已经开始了。 1984 年发布的第一代 Macintosh 电脑是一款极具乔布斯个人色彩的产品，其…</span>

何谓「数字生活」
二十年前，乔布斯在一次日本节目的采访中提到，他认为个人电脑的发展有三个阶段，分别是针对企业的生产力阶段、针对家庭用户的互联网阶段，以及针对个人的数字生活阶段。在最后一个阶段里，个人电脑作为数码相机、手机等一系列电子设备的数字中心，不仅能帮助人们处理数据表格、邮件等工作方面的事宜，还能够帮助所有人用更丰富的方式表现自己。去创作音乐，去拍照片，去剪辑视频，去表达自己独特的情感。这也是乔布斯一直信奉的价值观，即「站在科技和人文的交叉口上」。
二十年过去，他所设想的早已成真。「数字生活」的时代终于到来，没有人可以例外。
说真的，尽管问题重重，我还是很喜欢自己的数字生活。它让我感知到自我的延伸，以一种现实不能达到的方式。诚然，文字本就是主观的描述，音乐、摄影等一切艺术皆然；而被创作出的数字生活，和真实总有不能避免的差距。但就算「看见美好」和「描述美好」是容易产生误解的表达过程，前者依然使后者具备了价值。这也是我对生活的理解：记录，创作，这是热爱的表现。故而，唯有创作，才能沟通理想，抵御虚无。
关注自我是第一步。在此前的文章里，我介绍了许多记录自我的方法：比如 用 Notion 记下吃过的每一顿饭、构建自己的观影评分体系、用设计软件画下居住过的房间、建立桌面产品收纳的系统 等。这一次，我想做点略超出「自我」范畴外的：为陪伴我的猫猫小耳朵建立一个数字生活中心。

                    <span>松露，是个很无厘头的汉语译名。


顾名思义，它被比喻为松树凝出的露水。但这种生长在地下的真菌，既不在松树枝干上生长，也不依附松针松根形成的自然生态。橡树、榛树、椴树、榉树、桦树、松树、白杨都可以成为松露的生存环境。松树与松露，从没有必然联系。


事实上，直到上世纪80年代，松露在中国的名字依然充满了下里巴人的气息，“土茯苓”“无娘果”“猪拱菌”“臭鸡枞”……松露两字，最早出现在改革开放后的欧美文学译作里。


也许在中国的翻译家眼中，最珍贵最美味的食用真菌，天然就应该与松树搭上关系，比如松茸、松树蕈、松蘑、松耳；而露珠本身，则与可食用真菌一样，隐含着无根无蒂、无体无形，采纳天地灵气和日月精华而生的意蕴。


一个美丽的名词，从诞生之初，就夹带着狗血的误会。







No.1 壹


作为一种食物，Truffle准确的译名不是松露，而是“块菌”。从生物学的分类来看，块菌与羊肚菌的亲缘关系很接近，整个欧亚大陆和北美大陆各地，都能出产这种生长在土壤下的真菌。它是一种典型的世界性生物。


但东西方对它的态度，却有着天壤之别。西方有着悠久的松露食用史，4000年前，生活在两河流域的苏美尔人，就用楔形文字记载了一个孩子将这种食物献给国王的故事。而到了公元1世纪的古罗马时代，美食家阿比西斯在他的传世名作《厨艺》中，已经详细介绍了松露的吃法：煮熟后串起来，加盐烘烤出焦香；另将葡萄酒、橄榄油、胡椒、蜂蜜、鱼酱和酸葡萄汁一起煮沸，加入淀粉后做成蘸酱；最后在松露上用针刺出小孔，泡进蘸酱里吸取味道。


即便到了今天，人工培植相对困难，主要靠野外采集的松露，依然是餐桌上的珍品。但在2000年前，古罗马人已经实现了松露的常态化食用。一方面，贵族的奢靡生活，反映了古代欧洲封建国家的富庶和强大；另一方面，也证明了欧洲人珍视松露的饮食传统。







在中国，松露的应用就落后很多。上下五千…</span>

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.&quot;</span>

                    <span>In this extended interview, James welcomes BTS back to the Late Late Show couch after not seeing each other in person for 2 years and RM cuts to the chase to clear the air with Papa Mochi. After, James congratulates the band on their GRAMMY nomination and AMA wins before asking if they still get nerves before their performances. And the big question of the night: has Baby Mochi been in the gym?!

                    <span>Bel-Air | Coming 2022 to Peacock: https://pck.tv/3DcdDDy

Synopsis: Set in modern-day America, Bel-Air is a serialized one-hour dramatic analogue of the 90’s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” that leans into the original premise: Will’s complicated journey from the streets of West Philadelphia to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.

This Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / tiktok / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.16.4, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.16.5 in 2021!

The goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, camman18 from twitch / tiktok / twitter , playing Minecraft Java 1.16.5 and not Minecraft Bedrock.

THIS IS THE GREATEST CLIP EVER!!!!!</span>

                    <span>What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in react?


To put simply, controlled components have their data being handled with a react component whereas an uncontrolled component&#x27;s data is being handled with the DOM itself. Let&#x27;s dig into this answer a bit more though starting at the basics and including a few visual examples. 
Form elements are rendered with HTML within React components where data is being accessed and manipulate. When we are discussing uncontrolled and controlled components these are terms that are specifically discussing the way in which the form created is handling and accessing that said data. The data handling can be done a few different ways but is commonly seen using typed elements like,  and  or selected elements such as…</span>

                    <span>Overview:


Machine Learning (ML) and data science applications are in high demand. When ML algorithms offer information before it is known, the benefits for business are significant. Integrating machine learning algorithms for inference into production systems is a technological barrier hence the need for deploying ML models as API&#x27;S. 
In this short article, we implement AI based models to detect COVID-19 in Chest X-rays and CT Scans using four Deep Learning Algorithms: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception. Note, we shall focus mainly on implementing the api and not the model creation. 
To test my live endpoint, send a POST request to the following URL with an x-ray image appended to the body of the request. You will get the following sample output if request was successful:

Learning AWS is complicated enough. But learning AWS is made more challenging when you&#x27;re also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. 
In simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. 
Stacks can be stood up manually. However, it&#x27;s better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…</span>

Slate.js is a highly customizable platform for creating rich-text editors, also known as WYSIWYG editors. It enables you to create powerful, intuitive editors similar to those you’ve probably used in Medium, Dropbox Paper, or Google Docs. These are quickly becoming standard features for many web apps, and tools like Slate make them easier to implement, ensuring your program won’t get bogged down in complexity.
Although Slate is still in beta at the time of writing, it’s natural to ask whether it has the potential to replace more mature platforms like Quill and Draft.js. The short answer is that it&#x27;s far too early to tell, but here are a few facts to support why it could.

How does Mage explain models?
Conclusion
Machine learning models are usually seen as a “black box.” It takes some features as input and produces some predictions as output. The common questions after model training are:
How do different features affect the prediction results?
What are the top features that influence the prediction results?
The model performance metrics look great, but should I trust the results?

Thus, model explainability plays an important role in the machine learning world. Model insights are useful for the following reasons:

Directing future data collection
Informing human decision-making

It is capable of solving problems every developer faces, the test coverage is about 110%, and the code itself is just shy of a work of art. But then, as you push your last commit, you remember that, lurking in the shadows of your IDE, was a holdup most developers underestimate: documentation.
Ok, maybe it is not as scary as I make it sound, but still something you should respect, after all, every programmer has, at some point in their life, come across a poorly documented library or package, spent a few minutes of guesswork trying to make it work, maybe even tried reading a bit of the source code, just to finally give up on using it.

Hi! Remember when in the previous post I told you what HTML was, what it looked like and what the attributes were? well, it&#x27;s time to start playing with it. So grab paper and pencil and let&#x27;s get started! 
Ok, we know that the tags look like this:
    
 ....... some content .....
 as . 
Tags are generally always lowercase. 
We must close the tags so that they always work.
Well this is the basic structure :

         
            
Hello World    
                  
               …</span>

                    <span>Have you ever googled something, no matter what it is, a recipe, a meme or even a school assignment, and prayed that the answer would show up on a web page? I have too, and that&#x27;s why on more than one occasion I&#x27;ve wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.
Okay! to start with this:
HTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it &quot;programming language&quot; should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a &quot;markup language&quot; because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.
As I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :
content

However this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :


But that&#x27;s not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like &quot;upgrades&quot; of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.
content.

It seems interesting, doesn&#x27;t it? Well, don&#x27;t worry, in the next posts I&#x27;ll be telling you a little more so you won&#x27;t be left wanting. See you in the next one ! and remember to do what you love every day.</span>

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第5天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
🔥 一、组件化
作为一个单工程撸到底的开发人员，想试着将项目进行组件化改造，说动就动。毕竟技术都是写出来的，看着文章感觉懂了，但是实际开发中还是能遇到各种各样的问题，开始搞起来。
💥 1.1 为什么使用组件化
一直使用单工程撸到底，项目越来越大导致出现了不少的问题：
查找问题慢：定位问题，需要在多个代码混合的模块中寻找和跳转。
开发维护成本增加：避免代码的改动影响其它业务的功能，导致开发和维护成本不断增加。
编译时间长：项目工程越大，编译完整代码所花费的时间越长。
开发效率低：多人协作开发时，开发风格不一，又很难将业务完全分割，大家互相影响，导致开发效率低下。
代码复用性差：写过的代码很难抽离出来再次利用。
💥 1.2 模块化与组件化
🌀 1.2.1 模块
将一个程序按照其功能做拆分，分成相互独立的模块，以便于每个模块只包含与其功能相关的内容，比如登录模块、首页模块等等。
🌀 1.2.2 组件
组件指的是单一的功能组件，如登录组件、视频组件、支付组件 等，每个组件都可以以一个单独的 module 开发，并且可以单独抽出来作为 SDK 对外发布使用。可以说往往一个模块包含了一个或多个组件。
💥 1.3 组件化的优势
组件化基于可重用的目的，将应用拆分成多个独立组件，以减少耦合:
加快编译速度：每个业务功能都是一个单独的工程，可独立编译运行，拆分后代码量较少，编译自然变快。
解耦：通过关注点分离的形式，将App分离成多个模块，每个模块都是一个组件。
提高开发效率：多人开发中，每个组件模块由单人负责，降低了开发之间沟通的成本，减少因代码风格不一而产生的相互影响。
代码复用：类似我们引用的第三方库，可以将基础组件…</span>

前言
今年七月底，Google 正式发布了 Jetpack Compose 的 1.0 稳定版本，这说明Google认为Compose已经可以用于生产环境了。相信Compose的广泛应用就在不远的将来，现在应该是学习Compose的一个比较好的时机
Compose的基本知识与原理之后，通过一个完整的项目继续学习Compose应该是一个比较好的方式。
本文主要基于Compose，MVI架构，单Activity架构等，快速实现一个wanAndroid客户端,如果对您有所帮助可以点个Star: wanAndroid-compose
效果图
首先看下效果图










------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------







主要实现介绍
各个页面的具体实现可以查看源码，这里主要介绍一些主要的实现与原理
使用MVI架构
MVI 与 MVVM 很相似，其借鉴了前端框架的思想，更加强调数据的单向流动和唯一数据源,架构图如下所示

其主要分为以下几部分
Model: 与MVVM中的Model不同的是，MVI的Model主要指UI状态（State）。例如页面加载状态、控件位置等都是一种UI状态
View: 与其他MVX中的View一致，可能是一个Activity或者任意UI承载单元。MVI中的View通过订阅Model的变化实现界面刷新
Intent: 此Intent不是Activity的Intent，用户的任何操作都被包装成Intent后发送给Model层进行数据请求
例如登录页面的Model与Intent定…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(0 min)</span>
                    <span>疑问的开端
大家有没有想过一个问题：在浏览器里打开某个网页，网页上有一个按钮点击可以唤起App。

这样的效果是怎么实现的呢？浏览器是一个app；为什么一个app可以调起其他app的页面？
说到跨app的页面调用，大家是不是能够想到一个机制：Activity的隐式调用？
一、隐式启动原理
当我们有需要调起其他app的页面时，使用的API就是隐式调用。
比如我们有一个app声明了这样的Activity：

    
        
        
    


其他App想启动上边这个Activity如下的调用就好：
val intent &#x3D; Intent()
intent.action &#x3D; &quot;mdove&quot;
startActivity(intent)

我们没有主动声明Activity的class，那么系统是怎么为我们找到对应的Activity的呢？其实这里和正常的Activity启动流程是一样的，无非是if / else的实现不同而已。
接下来咱们就回顾一下Activity的启动流程，为了避免陷入细节，这里只展开和大家相对“耳熟能详”的类和调用栈，以串流程为主。
1.1、跨进程
首先我们必须明确一点：无论是隐式启动还是显示启动；无论是启动App内Activity还是启动App外的Activity都是跨进程的。比如我们上述的例子，一个App想要启动另一个App的页面。
注意没有root的手机，是看不到系统孵化出来的进程的。也就是我们常见的为什么有些代码打不上断点。

追过startActivity()的同学，应该很熟悉下边这个调用流程，跟进几个方法之后就发现进到了一个叫做ActivityTread的类里边。
ActivityTread这个类有什么特点？有main函数，就是我们的主线程。
很快我们能看到一个比较常见类的调用：Instrumentation：

前言：有做过完整项目的小伙伴应该都知道，随着业务的发展，app的运营需求会越来越多（比如：根据运营活动动态更换页面的UI）。这就要求我们的app要尽可能的满足市场的运营的动态化需求，通过这篇文章你将了解到：
1. Flutter动态化的方案使用和效果对比；
2. 针对中小型团队，该如何最小成本、最高效的实现app的动态化需求。
动态化的常用方式和实现原理
首先什么是动态化？即不依赖程序安装包，就能进行动态实时更新页面的技术。
一般大家都会想到webview，这确实是最常用的方式，但也是动态化中最不稳定的方式；webview的体验比较差，同时需要做大量设备的兼容。
基于 GPL 的 Native 增强。 GPL即通用编程语言，比如我们常见的Dart、JavaScript等，通过这些通用语言来为Native功能增强动态化能力。通俗的举个例子解释：运营者动态更改线上的js文件，Flutter应用通过网络拉取更新后动态渲染，这就是基于GPL的Native增强。
基于 DSL 的 Native 增强。 DSL即专用领域语言，为了解决某些特定场景下的任务而专门设计的语言,比如xml、json、css、html。通过生成简单的DSL语言文件，通过解析协议对页面进行动态配置。
腾讯开源的 MXFlutter
58同城开源的 Flutter Fair
阿里巴巴开源的 北海Kraken
同时我还会介绍另外两种比较通用的方式：
webview增强 【植入腾讯 X5内核，模型升级改造】
UI库模板化
各大厂动态化架构对比

Flutter Fair
Fair是“58同城”为Flutter设计的动态化框架，通过Fair Compiler工具实现JSON配置和原生Dart源文件的自动转化，从而动态更新Widget Tree和State。

                    <span>今年的十一假期期间我没有继续宅在家里，而是选择打破两点一线的工作日生活，去探寻不一样的城市和自然美景——当然除了感受异地的人文风景之外，我还有另外一个目的：作为「村长」，为了更好地建设村落而积累更多的「步数」。
这或许是我第一次因为一款游戏而「运动」。

一个用「步数」建成的「猫猫村」
比起那些需要不断氪金或者让你看广告的手游，我更喜欢《猫猫村》这种「无负担」的「健康手游」——没有虚拟世界里的激烈竞争，也没有让我沉迷到不可自拔的关卡，整个游戏玩下来的感觉只有一个：原来只要健康生活就可以满足你所建设的这个《猫猫村》中村民们的需求，让这些可爱的「像素猫」可以开心愉悦地生活。

而如何建设你的猫猫村？答案就在自己脚下——尽力地在现实世界中坚持运动来获得步数，就可以用来在游戏中建设房屋、道具、家具等，并以此让猫猫村中村民生活得更惬意，而村民们如果对当前的生活感到满意就会产生「爱心」：这同样也是一种重要的建设资源，随着爱心获取越多，你可以一步步地解锁更高级的建筑以及道具，从而让你的村落设施更全面，进一步地扩大村落吸引更多的村民入住。

我不知道这样以运动步数作为游戏中重要资源的设计是否更符合现代年轻人的「佛系生活方式」，但不得不说《猫猫村》让我们每天的步数有了更多的使用场景，使得每天的运动可能不再仅仅是蚂蚁森林中新增的绿地、微信运动中每日的步数排行榜，或者是 Apple Watch 获得的运动成就徽章……

这款游戏为那些看似日常的运动赋予了一种新的使命感——让自己的努力为游戏中的「他们」带来美好的生活，这又何不是另一种类型的自我心灵疗愈？
像素画风下的温馨小村
不仅仅是游戏要素，从画面上《猫猫村》就完全有别于我玩过的任何一款游戏，甚至你可能会觉得它无论在画面上还是设置方面都显得有些「简陋」——八位像素风格的画面，整个场景设计成了横板卷轴，因而整个村落的建设完全是在一个 2D 的平面中进行铺设，甚至在建设玩法上实际更像是在一个线上依次摆设——既不能调整建筑的大小，也不能调整建筑或者家具的位置。

当然对于喜欢像素风游戏的朋友而言，《猫猫村》又是很独特的，类似早年八位机游戏的文本互动方式在现在看来，显得是那么地复古与时尚。

这种画面上的简单让你不由得会想到早年的像素风游戏甚至是那些横板过关的游戏——因此游戏的发展进行或者是场景的解锁都是向两侧进行，比如你可以根据猫猫村民 NPC的提示来扩展村落边界，或者是通过建设不同的建筑来创建更多的子场景，而这些分散的子场景让游戏随着时间推进一步步地变得更加丰富有趣。

每天就玩十分钟：真的不能再多了！
如果你每天都抽出时间玩上一会儿《猫猫村》，你可能会觉得他是你见过的最「佛系」、最不会让人上瘾的游戏了。

游戏中的玩法其实非常简单，你需要带领一群像素猫猫建立一个自己的村庄，而最初的生产资料就是你每日的步数，我们需要使用步数来兑换最为基础的建筑，比如水井、树等等，通过和猫猫们的共同努力来建设村落中的第一栋房屋。

随着游戏的进行，猫猫们在村落生活的同时开始产生大量的「❤️」，同样作为生产资料，你可以使用「❤️」来安装抵御偷心贼的武器，也可以用来兑换一系列的新建筑，而猫猫 NPC 也会随着时间推移给出相应的建设请求，并一步步地提醒你建设新的建筑与设施。

当你真正上手之后就会发现，实际上整个《猫猫村》的节奏并不快，相比那些几个小时就开始提醒你继续建设的放置类手游，《猫猫村》的平均游玩时间可以说非常短，而我每一次的游戏时间也在十几分钟左右，在完成 NPC 给的小任务之后往往更多的是点触村民猫猫来进行互动。

随着游戏的进行，你可以建造的建筑以及家具就会又来越多，这些建筑物或者家具其实也暗藏玄机，比如你可以使用幸运转盘进行抽奖，甚至你可以通过将记事板放到房间里，并使用密码锁给房间上锁，在猫猫村中撰写你的「私密日记」。

结语
在上手《猫猫村》之后，我带上村民回到了自己生活的城市，回到了那些用钢铁水泥构筑的森林和那封闭的格子间，好在手机的那一头还有一些用像素构成的小猫在等着我，等着我在疲累的工作之余，和他们简单地来一次互相治愈的游戏。

                    <span>比起早年的功能的增加和设计语言的迭代，这两年的 iOS 更新显然更具有时代的印记 —— 疫情时代下（尤其是 Apple 所在的美国），无法预知的明天和不能见面的彼此，要怎样才能继续保持真切的沟通和高效的工作？经过一年的思考，Apple 终于在 iOS 15 的更新概览页面给出了答案 ——「更有聊，更专注」这六个大字，已经定下了整个 iOS 15 更新的基调。

更有聊，自然指的是同播共享和 FaceTime、信息中的各种分享功能；而更专注，自然就是下面要详细聊到的「专注模式」了。
实际案例
相信大部分读者都已经不止一次地看过专注模式的详解，但这些「详解」往往显得有些不够「接地气」，普通用户看完也很难创建属于自己的专注模式。
下面我们就结合实际的案例，来具体分析都用到了哪些操作。更重要的是，这些案例希望能对你设定自己的专注模式提供思路，起到一个抛砖引玉的作用。
写稿模式
作为一个自由撰稿人，写稿几乎已经成为了生活中最日常的事情，而它正好也需要我长时间保持状态，所以为它创建一个专注模式是再合适不过了。
首先，我们进入专注模式的页面，点击右上角创建一个新的专注类型。系统本身会为你建议几种专注模式，不过这里我们就直接选择自定。命名并做好个性化操作之后，点击下一步就可以正式进入详细的设置选项。
一般来说，电话和信息已经不是我的主要联系方式，因此我只给家人添加到了允许列表中，其它的都选择了不允许。当然，为了能让他人在真的有急事时能联系到我，我也会打开允许重复来电的选项。

接下来是设定允许通知的 App。毕竟是个需要长时间集中精力的活，写稿模式下的通知提醒自然是越少越好。因此诸如微信、微博、Instagram 这类社交应用自然是排除在外的，仅仅允许一些较重要的 App 和时效性的通知推送。值得一提的是，这里面的 App 其实不仅包括了 iPhone、iPad App，还包括了 Appl…</span>

新的蒙版面板
在 Lightroom 2022 的蒙版面板中，除原有的「画笔、径向滤镜、渐变滤镜」，新增了「选择主体、选择天空、颜色范围、明亮度范围、深度范围」五个蒙版工具，相信大家对「选择主体」并不陌生，在 Photoshop CC 中，借助由 Adobe Sensei 驱动的选择主体（Select Subject）功能，可以轻松地选中图像中的物体，此次 Adobe 将这一功能下放至 Lightroom 与 Lightroom Classic 终于肯将牙膏挤给 Lightroom，进一步提高摄影后期的工作效率。

选择主体功能
在 Lightroom 2021 及以往版本，如果需要对照片中的某一物体进行分区处理，只有两种方法 —— 导出 DNG 后导入到 Photoshop 处理，或者是「手搓蒙版」。遇到复杂物体时，真的是要「笑嘻嘻」了。
当用户更新至 Lightroom 2022 后，可根据需要选择照片中的主体、天空，以及根据明亮度、颜色进行抠像处理。

但凡能摆个桌子有点地方，大家都有把东西收拾收拾弄个漂亮桌面的想法。但理想总是很丰满， 现实一直很骨感，大部分人对于怎么收拾桌子根本就无从下手。笔者根据自己的布置经验，来给大家说说要注意的几个点。

01 桌面结构拓扑
设备拓扑还请见图，具体内容在下面的小节中展开。

02 理线与思路
俗话说得好：简约风格靠藏，极简风格靠扔。设备众多，自然各种设备的线缆缠在一块就堪比盘丝洞了。桌面的布置，不管是有线还是无线化，需要注意的都是把线捋好顺下去。一堆不同粗细和外皮材质的线在桌面上盘根错节，那可太难看了。那自然，整洁的第一步自然是把桌面的线缆都尽量放在桌后/下。

不过线缆本身就有长度和重量，很多设备还需要适配器，光用线自己坠着肯定会一股脑全掉下来。这个时候这种桌下理线槽的作用就体现出来了：适配器直接放在架子上，一些软质线材绑好后放在架子上，硬质线材就卷在架子上面，这样布置好就不会乱糟糟一团了。只要足够长，就不存在放不下的情况。

另外关于供电：一个是插座的插孔一定要互不干涉，方便尽量全部都能安排上；二是也要放在桌后/下不在视野内出现。符合这样要求的自然就是 PDU 插座了。像是升降桌这种有有横承桌子，就可以用扎带直接绑住 PDU 两边的耳朵固定。

那么从桌下转到桌上。现在显示器是明基 EW3270U，日常使用情况下是要接入三根线的：一根电源线，一根 HDMI 线和一根 Type-C 线，分别用于供电和设备连接。如果直接使用显示器自身的支架和木制增高架的话，建议将线捋好后用扎带绑紧，再由后部垂下以达到藏线的效果。而是用悬臂支架就省事了，只…</span>

Lyrics:
Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies yeah
I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her maybe
Did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain’t it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits
And ain’t it funny
How you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don’t look like it

Allows you to transform JSON data into an object whose members can be queried using the member access operator. Unlike json.dumps in the standard library that returns a dictionary object, this library returns a JSONObjectMapper object. The attributes of these objects are defined by the contents of the JSON data provided to it
It can be installed using pip 
pip install json2obj
https://github.com/trumpowen/json2obj

import datetime
from json2obj import JSONObjectMapper 

person &#x3D; JSONObjectMapper(&quot;&quot;&quot;{ &quot;name&quot; : &quot;trumpowen&quot; , &quot;age&quot; : 125 }&quot;&quot;&quot;) 
person.name &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;trumpowen&quot; # true
person.age &#x3D;&#x3D; 125 # true 
# replaces and overwrites 
person.name &#x3D; {} 
person.name.first_name &#x3D; &quot;Wilkins&quot; 
person.name.last_name &#x3D; &quot;Owen&quot; 
person.name.other_names &#x3D; [&quot;Trump&quot;]

# add new attribute. If this is not desired, you can initialize the object with readonly set to True. This will prevent the addition of new attributes and changing the values of existing attributes 
person.dob &#x3D; datetime(1900, 12, 6) 
json_data &#x3D; str(person) # returns a string representation 
json_as_dict &#x3D; person.to_dict() # returns a dictionary representation 

Use help(obj) , where obj is an instance of JSONObjectMapper</span>

                    <span>Diariamente o ser humano vem procurando e criando meios para acelerar a evolução, e aqui eu vou passar um pouco de 3 pilares que eu tenho utilizado evoluir cada vez no meu desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional.
A falta de foco e uma das piores pedras no caminho dos devs quando se trata de evolução, o grande leque de tecnologias que surgem diariamente faz com que muitos devs(principalmente os iniciantes) não tenham um foco especifico em uma stack e isso acaba atrapalhando a evolução de muita gente.
Não se trata qual e a melhor tecnologia, se trata de qual tecnologia você e melhor desenvolvendo.
Mantenha sua atenção no que você esta estudando no momento.
ouvir uma frase uma vez que falava que longevidade &gt; intensidade
E para você evoluir com tecnologia que você escolheu não basta só ter foco se você não exercita, e necessário MUITA PRATICA, e a pratica que acelera o seu desenvolvimento.
Programação e uma disciplina pratica, e ela que vai te da toda bagagem e experiência para vencer os desafios que você enfrenta no seu dia a dia e te transforma e um profissional muito mais capacitado no mercado.
A teoria só funciona quando você sabe quando e onde aplicar.
A sensação de esta apenas copiando código e super normal para quem ta começando, mas a repetição se transforma em repertorio e todo o código começa a fazer sentido
Ter pessoas ao seu lado, vivendo o mesmo contexto que você e o melhor combustível que um dev pode receber, o aprendizado compartilhado e a troca de experiências faz a sua evolução se tornar mais leve e divertida.
Quem nunca teve um bug que não resolvia a dias e um amigo ajudou a resolver. Esta ao lado de devs mais experientes faz com que você esteja sempre atualizado com as melhores praticas e tecnologias do mercado
Conhecimento quanto mais a gente divide, mais se multiplica!</span>

                    <span>These are some rules that I have lazily picked up over the past four years of professional development on angular.
I generally work on small to medium projects without the time to integrate a formal state management system.
It is for this reason that there are data services that try to solve the problem of carrying communication around. If anyone has any further questions or curiosities regarding these points feel free to leave a comment.
methods must be extracted into functions until nothing can be extracted anymore
the component logic shold refer only to local resources of the component as much as possible
dataservices deal with data I/O with the server
the business Logic must live within the dataservice and all components should be of assistance to the business Logic, visualization assistance and small local logics to visualize and modify data
components (internal to the feature internal to the root component) must implement the root dataservice or receive data as input (observables are strongly preferred)
avoid multi-level handovers through inputs, it slows you down and makes refactoring a hassle
if the data as input changed hands more than twice use a dataservice,
each feature must have its own module and declare components related only to that feature
putting the general dataservice next to the feature module is the best way to indicate the root from which to start exploring the code
the beginning of the end of the data flow must take place within the dataservice

the substrate cache-services for API calls must live in the provide of the feature module they belong to and refer to
components  can be interaction contexts between dataservices but services are preferred when possible
interaction services can be interaction contexts between dataservices</span>

                    <span>Esse exercício recebe dois inputs iniciais: um integer N, relativo à quantidade de números em um array, e um integer M, relativo a um subarray deslocável que fará a &quot;varredura&quot; dentro do array principal.

N &#x3D; quantidade de números do array
Dessa forma, os arrays estruturados com M &#x3D; 3 serão:
[5, 3, 5]
Como todos os subarrays precisam ter M números, nesse caso esses serão os subarrays possíveis.
Depois disso, precisamos que o programa contabilize qual é o máximo de números únicos existentes em um subarray de tamanho M.
[5, 3, 5] &#x3D; 2 números únicos
Sendo assim, o máximo de números únicos em um subarray será 3. Esse precisa ser o output.
Vamos para a solução, dividida em partes:
Primeiro declaramos um Array de Integers de nome deque.
Declaramos também um Hashset de Integers de nome hashset. L…</span>

So here I would like to share with you my favorite image and video placeholder Place Corgi. As you can guess I am a Corgi lover and this image placeholder is just perfect for me, and everyone who loves dogs and especially Corgis.
It is easy to use, just a link to Place Corgi site with a width and optional height specified after the URL.
http://placecorgi.com/width/height
Also, we can place a video as a placeholder. To do that, we would add /v to the URL along with width and height
http://placecorgi.com/v/width/height
You can add the Place Corgi js file to your application, which will automatically replace any img tags that have the class corgi with images from Place Corgi.

                    <span>Introduction


Have you ever wondered how search engines like Google, fetch data from different parts of the web and serve it to you as a user, based on your query? The method used by applications like this is termed crawling. 
Search engines work and by crawling and indexing billions of web pages using different web crawlers called web spiders or search engine bots. What these web spiders do is follow links from each web page that have been indexed to discover new ages.
In this short article, you will be building out your own web crawler using Python and its popular web framework for extracting the data you need from websites.
Also, in this tutorial, developers tend to be confused with web crawling and web scraping. We would learn the difference between these two concepts and examine some…</span>

                    <span>The Prometheus.yml:
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label &#x60;job&#x3D;&#x60; to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: &#x27;prometheus&#x27;

    # metrics_path defaults to &#x27;/metrics&#x27;
    # scheme defaults to &#x27;http&#x27;.

    static_configs:
      - targets: [&#x27;localhost:9090&#x27;]

  - job_name: &#x27;node-exporter&#x27;

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - :9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net&#x3D;&quot;host&quot; --pid&#x3D;&quot;host&quot;  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot;  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs&#x3D;/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type&#x3D;bind,source&#x3D;/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination&#x3D;/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published&#x3D;9090,target&#x3D;9090,protocol&#x3D;tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.</span>

Cloud computing has boomed in the last decade and cloud adoption is at the top of every tech exec’s to do list. More and more companies are considering migrating to the cloud, but what does cloud migration mean, what does the process involve, and what are the benefits and challenges? In this article we will cover this topic and explain how Gennovacap can help your company with cloud migration services.

                    <span>Imagine you have a large set of news articles, and want to provide a way to allow your users to search through them. For example, here are 5 random articles from the Economist:
An investment bonanza is coming
Who governs a country’s airspace?
What is a supermoon, and how noticeable is it to the naked eye?
What the evidence says about police body-cameras
Who controls Syria?
Let’s think about what kind of queries potential users issue and the articles that we would want to return.
A search for “investment” should return the 1st article.
A search for “supermoon” should return the 3rd article.
A search for “syria” should return the 5th article.
This is quite simple to implement with traditional information retrieval techniques, since these queries have keyword matching.

                    <span>This article is about the strategy of handling errors in your C# GraphQL APIs and is based on Sasha Solomon&#x27;s article about handling errors in GraphQL environments. 
It&#x27;s adopted to asp.net core server implementation (Hot Chocolate) and it&#x27;s a glimpse of how it might look and be used in your next GraphQL application.
Mostly, the mentioned article is about separating &quot;errors&quot; into categories:
errors (e.g. Internal Server Error)
results (Deleted User, Unavailable in Country)
Later on, it encourages to use union types for response modeling. It also highlights the pros of this approach and shows the cons of using the default approach.
GraphQL errors mostly look like this one.

Let&#x27;s start with something easier. The next cases will help us to understand the concept of infer. Ok, look at the piece of code:

TypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it&#x27;s a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it. By the way, where will be another type in case of const usage. Try it by yourself. I&#x27;m waiting for your explanation in the comments. This is a small interactive with a reader)

                    <span>Interviews are always a nerve-wracking thing to do! You spend hours upon hours studying Data Structures and Algorithms, Youtube top programming interview questions and answers, and think of all of the possible questions the interviewer can ask you. 
Thanks to Flatiron School, I was able to prepare for a mock interview to go through these same trials and tribulations as my peers. I am writing this blog post to encourage my fellow aspiring software developers to take every interview opportunity that you can, because just like programming, practice makes perfect. Here is how my mock interview went.
1) The Meet - n - Greet 
2) Technical Q&amp;A

During the technical Q&amp;A portion of my interview, I was asked a handful of React questions. Here were some of the questions that I was asked:

                    <span>Let me describe my coding journey to build a Social Proof component from Frontend Mentors. Frontend Mentors is a online platform that provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs.
The goal is to build this:

The first coding hurdle was setting up the HTML &amp; CSS to create the initial layout and then testing if it flowed decently between mobile and desktop as intended. 
My first decision was deciding between CSS Grid, Flexbox, or a combination of the two. Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool
My tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas.

Screen-shot of the Layout

The next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.
Screen shot of app in development, no styling

Now for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. 
The one thing I didn&#x27;t know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time.

I learned how to add multiple background images at one time. 
I was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: 
Design a responsive layout
Build a foundation with HTML
Add content
Style with CSS, section by section
End with functionality (JavaScript &amp; CSS animation/transitions)
This &quot;Ground up&quot; methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra &quot;Slow is Fast&quot;.

                    <span>What do I do?


We often see technical blog posts from experienced developers sharing their insights from years of coding, hardly ever from someone just starting out. The hardest part of beginning a project is actually imagining a project to start, at least for me. So, I sought inspiration from the internet. (codecademy&#x27;s final project)
Codecademy&#x27;s Final Project in python was to create some terminal program. This was my first project completely from scratch. Of the options at codecademy I decided on the blackjack game. Making a blackjack game seemed fairly challenging but within my grasp. So I got to work. BTW, you can find the source code here
I began by establishing what I would actually need to play blackjack in real life. That being a deck of cards and some people to play with. I didn…</span>

  level of challenge 4/10


A string is a palindrome when it is the same 
For example:
Write a function named palindrome that takes a single string as its parameter.
def palindrome(string):
    pal_string &#x3D; list( string.casefold() )
    rev_string &#x3D; list( reversed(pal_string) )

    if pal_string &#x3D;&#x3D; rev_string:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(palindrome(&quot;aba&quot;))

def palindrome(string):
    while len(string) &gt; 1:
      head &#x3D; string[0]
      tail &#x3D; string[-1]
      string &#x3D; string[1:-1]
      if head !&#x3D; tail:
        return False
    return True

def palindrome(string):
  if len(string) &lt; 2:
    return True
  return string[0] &#x3D;&#x3D; string[-1] and palindrome(string[1:-1])

def palindrome(string):
  return string &#x3D;&#x3D; string[::-1]

Let’s make a query for a temperature api using javascript fetch
First let’s create the interface, we’ll do something simple, using just HTML.

  
  


To present the data we have a div with two spans, one to represent the city and the other to represent the temperature.
const CITY &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;city&#x27;);
const TEMPERATURE &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;temperature&#x27;);

I didn&#x27;t want to make the previous post too long, so I didn&#x27;t touch the multistage builds. Here is the post where I will show you how to improve the Dockerfile even more, using multistage builds. Using stages in your builds is not hard to use, but there are some things where the below knowledge may help you 😃

                    <span>Olá!
Este é mais um post da seção Design, e nele vamos tratar de um pattern bastante útil em cenários com múltiplas condições, o Chain of Responsibility (CoR, ou Cadeia de Responsabilidade, em tradução livre). Veremos também como integrá-lo ao container de injeção de dependência do ASP.Net Core.
Vamos lá!
Antes de mais nada, precisamos entender qual a utilidade do pattern, ou seja, qual problema ele resolve. Patterns são soluções cabíveis para um dado tipo de problema, e com o CoR não é diferente.
Imagine um cenário onde, para atender a uma dada requisição (ou comando) a satisfação de diversas condições seja necessária e que, para cada condição, pode haver um dado processamento específico a ser realizado ou um tipo de resultado a ser retornado.
Soa estranho? Explico.

Quit All：在 Mac 上一键退出应用程序

平台：macOS
关键词：应用管理、活动监视、后台管理

@huhuhang：在使用 Mac 处理工作时，往往需要打开非常多的应用，但同时也会拖慢系统性能。此外，像我这样有一些「强迫症」的人，总是喜欢把暂时不用的应用一一手动退出。

Quit All 这款主打应用退出痛点的小工具非常实用，你可以把它理解成 Mac 自带「活动监视器」的易用版本。它支持从菜单栏非常方便地退出当前正在运行的应用，或者「一键退出」全部应用。同时，Quit All 提供了过滤后台应用、不弹出退出确认框等个性化选项。一键退出不仅可以满足强迫症，还能够有下班仪式感，每天下班时我都会执行 Quit All。

除了 Quit All，顺带推荐一下应用退出小工具 Quitter。Quitter 和知名播客客户端 Overcast 是同一个开发者。Quitter 主打定时退出，对于处于未激活状态的应用，你可以设置自动退出倒计时。Quitter 对于低频应用特别实用，避免我们忘记手动退出。有了 Quit All 和 Quitter 的完美搭配，退出应用变得无比轻松。

                    <span>10 月的某天，我家楼下的布告栏贴了一张通知，告知住户 10 月 18 日小区要停电一天。虽然此前这种事情也曾发生过，但是也就是停一会儿而已，所以我也就没拿当回事。然而，这次停电持续了将近一整天，在我黑灯瞎火地做饭的时候，我真真切切地感受到电已经渗透到生活的方方面面，没有电是万万不能的（事后了解到，这次是涉及小区供电的一个变压器调整）。这次停电的「阴影」之大，直接唤醒了我儿时的停电记忆。
曾经的停电记忆
在《沿海地区的山珍漫游指南：盘点家乡那些奇怪的美食》一文中，我曾简要地介绍过我老家的一些情况。在细聊限电应对措施之前，我想先聊聊我小时候见过、用过的那些「原始」的应对停电的方案。
因为电力紧张（或者村民们拖欠电费），我儿时经常会遇到停电。每当停电的时候，我经常会点起火油（煤油）灯，火油的那股味道挥之不去。除了火油灯，也有用瓦斯灯（电石灯）的。伴随着忽闪忽闪的火油灯，我经常在微光下赶作业。再到后来，遇到停电的时候用起了蓄电池的灯。这就是之前应对停电时照明的措施。
除了照明受影响，停电其实对于我们日常的饮食、取暖影响其实并不算大。
作为一个深处胶东腹地的山村，我们当地日常的燃料主要是苹果树的枝条及各种作物的秸秆藤蔓，「果木炭烤」再平常不过了。农村烧火做饭顶多用一下鼓风机来助燃（有些家庭甚至还在使用传统的、节能环保的风箱），所以停电时候把鼓风机变成用扇子扇，不影响炭火正常燃烧。
每家每户必备的取暖设备则是火炕。火炕可以将灶台做饭时产生的多余热量引导至炕内，用来给室内供暖。虽然现在很多人家里使用上了液化气、添置了土暖气、空调，但火炕始终是一个标配。因此，停电对于取暖的影响也算不上大，除了极少数喜好电热毯的人。
胶东地区民居中很常见的火炕，利用厨房余热取暖
停电也不影响村里供水。村民们的日常用水来自井水，而且每家都有一个储水用的大水缸，所以几乎不存在停水一说。
整体上来讲，停电对于传…</span>

                    <span>正所谓「硬件是基建，软件生产力」，在软件正版化理念逐渐成为主流的当下，免费好用的「开源」软件也成了不少人的选择。对于个人用户来说，使用开源软件有如下优势：

更便宜：降低软件授权费用，节约使用成本；
更安全：相对于闭源的软件来说，我们无法看到其内部代码，对个人隐私的顾虑只能依靠软件厂商的诚信度和法规，而开源软件公开了源代码，就算我们自己不会看，也会有其他程序员朋友帮助甄别筛选，相对更可靠一些；
更稳定：本文介绍的软件大部分是比较老牌的软件，持续运营多年具有稳定性。

作为已经过了「不当家不知柴米油盐」年纪的普通用户，应对当前大势所趋的订阅及超前消费的方式就是选择适合自己的开源软件。其次，作为折腾软件十余年但不会编程的「玩家」，天然对开源软件有亲切感，非常喜欢这种奔着相对纯粹目的完善能够造福更多人的工具。
最后，「实用为王」能够解决实际问题且符合自己使用习惯的开源软件会作为我的首选。本人日常工作生活主要用到 Windows 和 macOS 平台，偶尔还需要折腾 Linux。本文本着「完全无需付费，也能很好用」这一原则，我挑选了个人使用过的 18 款开源软件分享给大家。

当你想要快速记录稍纵即逝的灵感时，肯定不会喜欢需要繁琐操作步骤才能记录或者启动缓慢的 App。如果能够更进一步，能够把随时随地记录自动同步或聚合就更好了。为了实现这一目标，我试用了多款收费及开源工具，最终保留了 Simplenote 作为主力碎片文本收集和同步工具。相比其他软件，Simplenote 具备如下优势：

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。

前言
在日常使用中我们会因为种种原因，从各种地方保存图片、动图和视频，而在 iOS 的默认 App「照片」中，它们大部分时候都会被存放在同一个文件夹——系统相册中。虽然有的 App 会独立创建文件夹，但那对于日常使用和相册管理来说只是杯水车薪，你的系统相册里还是十分混乱。
相册内容之多，靠手动的 Slidebox 已经拯救不了了
我在 2017 年转到 iOS 之前一直是个安卓用户，当时用的手机会默认把「相机相册」和剩下全部图片分开储存，在我眼中是一个很好甚至必须的功能。从逻辑上也更加合理：保存的图片与拍摄的照片本就是不同的内容，自然要保存到不同的位置。
将照片独立出来的好处不止分类，在翻看相册时也会拥有更好的体验，在看着照片触动回忆时不会被无关的图片干扰。值得一提的是，iOS 的「照片」里其实是有分类的，遗憾的是「媒体类型」中从视频到动图的 11 个分类里，没有一个是「相机相册」。
系统相册自带的分类功能
虽然如此，我们还可以用苹果自己在 Mac 端的工具「智能相簿」，曲线救国凭空造出一个「相机相册」出来。
正文
通过 iCloud 照片和 Mac 端「照片」App 在独有的「智能相簿」功能，可以在苹果设备创建一个所谓的「相机相册」。方法如下：
1. 左侧分栏——相簿——点击加号
Mac版「照片」App 的边栏
2. 新建智能相册——条件——相机型号——包括——iPhone。
如果曾拥有多部 iPhone手机（如曾用 iPhone 8 现用 iPhone 13）选择 iPhone 会将系列的照片全部包括
如果手机里有其他设备（如 iPad，单反相机或其他手机）拍摄的照片并且也希望保存的话，重复第二步，将最后的 「iPhone」改为相机型号，分别建立智能相簿。
3. 因为系统会把你在 iPhone 上的屏幕截图认定为是 iPhone 拍摄的照片，所以我们需要给智能相簿再添加一个条件：
光圈——在范围内——ƒ/1.8至ƒ/32（即全部范围）

4. 当所有相机型号的智能相簿都被建立后，仿照第一步新建一个普通相簿，将之前建立的几个「智能相簿」拖拽进去。 合并成一个完整的相簿。
编注：在 Mac 上创建的「智能相簿」不会 显示 在 iPhone 或 iPad 上的「照片」中，因此需要第四步以及后续维护。
5. 现在，你终于有了你本就该有的「相机相册」。
6. 因为第四步中合并出的「完整相簿」并非智能相簿，所以它需要不定期更新。方法也很简单：想起来的时候顺手把装着 iPhone 照片的智能相簿（第二步创建的相册）再拖进「完整相簿」就可以完成更新，新的照片会被添加，旧的照片不会重复。

第一次在少数派写文章，如有疏忽漏洞还敬请谅解，欢迎在评论区讨论话题与指出问题。
感谢老麦点赞我的微博想法，不然我也不会完善我的想法并把文章出来。其实契机只是自己整理相册的时候被气得忍无可忍了还搜不到教程而已。
虽说绕了一大圈终于把心心念念的相机相册弄了出来，但如此基本的设置苹果没有做还是很让人沮丧，还是希望苹果早日浪子回头。

通用和福特进入芯片开发领域以应对短缺
据第一财经、界面新闻等转引美国媒体报道，福特汽车公司和通用汽车公司正在寻求进入半导体业务。
11 月 18 日，福特与美国半导体制造商 GlobalFoundries 达成了一项战略协议，可能在美国境内推进半导体制造和技术发展。福特表示，设计自己的芯片可以改善一些汽车功能，例如自动驾驶、电池系统等，并有可能助其避免未来的短缺。
通用汽车则称，它正在与高通等半导体领域的大公司建立联系，并达成协议共同开发和生产汽车用芯片，以应对目前汽车用芯片的短缺问题。通用总裁表示，此合作是降低生产复杂度、提高利润率战略的一部分；预测该公司未来几年对半导体的需求将增加一倍以上。来源

                    <span>开发者来强答一波
《物理世界》的灵感诞生于CIGA Game Jam 2019上。
当时的题目是一张这样的图片：



（看到图片的我亿脸蒙蔽XD）
但没办法，题还是要做的哇，所以我就在想，这爱心到底怎么插入小人中奖的三角形？

一般正常情况下看到这个问题，肯定是会想到“父母的爱对孩子来说太沉重”，“看起来好的东西不一定适合自己”一类的观点，但可能是我苦于物理荼毒久已，导致我第一时间想到的事居然是——

爱心通过怎样的形态变化能成为三角形，最终契合进小人的内心？我脑内闪过了一万个公式，发现都没有办法解决我的疑惑。
进而，我联想到了《Baba is you》——一款通过不同的组合方式产生不同的效果，最终解决谜题的作品。




虽然和物理世界不尽相同，但通过不同组合方式，改变角色行动逻辑，最终让角色成功移动到终点的解谜内核触动了我。彼时的我已经把题目图片抛之脑后，满脑子只想的是“我要把各种物理公式嵌进一款解谜游戏中”，让玩家再次体验被物理课堂所支配的......
就这样，初版的物理世界诞生了。

（老版本的物理世界，当时主角还不是盒娘）

尽管Game Jam很快就结束了，我们对继续制作《物理世界》的热情却丝毫没有熄灭。
首先，我们决定更换美术素材——黑板的绿底白字让人感觉过于古板，于是我们打算采用更卡通的风格让画面更有活力。


Game Jam上制作的版本中的地图的地形均为直接绘制，这不利于后续关卡的搭建和维护。我们首先换用了TileMap插件来搭建地形和绘制方块。但它的自由度不是很高，有些比较不规则的图形无法实现。于是我们又换用了更加自由的SpriteShapeController来编辑地形。


继续制作解密游戏最重要的一点就是丰富关卡内容了。为了扩充关卡内容，我们在接下来的时间里制作了更多的关卡，包括摩擦力关卡、浮力关卡、圆周运动关卡以及动量关卡。

 摩擦力关卡

浮力关卡

圆周运动关卡

动量关卡
一切关卡的设计思路以有趣为前提，为此我们也都是绞尽脑汁，不断迭代我们的作品。
当内容逐渐丰富之后，游戏主要矛盾逐渐转移到了用户的游玩体验之上。
在游玩《Baba is you》的过程中，尽管你会被他惊艳的创意所折服，但有时也会莫名其妙的过关弄昏头脑。
如果玩家与设计者的脑洞没有对上，关卡的乐趣就会骤减，原本精妙的解谜关卡设置在玩家眼中可能会“过于电波系”，让玩家一头雾水，卡关的挫败感也许会让他们不再打开这部作品。

为了解决这样的问题，在设计比较复杂的关卡的时候，我们或有意或无意地留下了多于一种的过关方式。




在这个关卡中，你可以选择黄色和紫色方块中任何一个用于垫脚

我们加入了提示系统以避免避免玩家长时间的卡关导致失去兴趣的情况出现，但于此同时，我们也不会给予玩家包办式的过关引导——玩家依然需要去考虑如何实现提示系统中的各条提示，它们一般都不会太难，只是需要花点时间。


同时，为了玩家能够更好地get到我们设计时的脑洞，我们也特地的在靠前的引导关卡中以更简单的方法呈现给玩家。

这个关卡的过关方式中需要用方块将红色小旗撞下来。
在本作最开始的测试中，许多玩家第一次看到这样的关卡时，往往无法第一时间悟到本关的解谜机制，最终会因为定式思维卡关很久。
我们注意到了这点，于是在较为前面的关卡中加入了这样的一关来进行引导。

这关需要玩家用蓝色方块将红色小旗撞下
这样一来，玩家能更容易地理解并利用这样的机制进行解密。
在游戏进行测试的过程中我们发现，有的玩家在一开始就难以理解这个游戏的机制——用物理公式来控制场上的物体。甚至在第一关就不知所措。于是我们又额外增加了教程关卡来解决这个问题。


教程关中通过文字一步步的指导，让玩家了解游戏的机制以及游玩思路——这成功地降低了游戏的上手难度，也让这部作品能够得以有机会被更多用户所看到。
一起来体验《物理世界》的美妙吧！

                    <span>屠龙勇者终成恶龙，一种循环何时结束？
注：为求简单，本文许多处会称呼索尔斯克亚为索肖。
新教练上任，欣欣向荣，一切向好，给人希望。但在执教中期，教练技战术在锐意革新与固执保守中打转。在执教末期，教练自掘坟墓式地弃用可用之人，一步步把自己宽裕的手牌变成买人不利阵容太薄。这一集，你是不是已经看过无数遍了？这样循环播放的戏码，在后弗格森时代不断上演，以致于按下快进键也不会漏掉关键剧情。
这，就是这些年的曼联。
作为球员，索尔斯克亚与曼联共同拼下过至高荣誉，也陪俱乐部一起经历过短暂重建的低谷。作为教练，他受命于危难之际，一度曾经展现过从二流向一流进化的希望，但因一念之差选择了虚假的弗格森传统，并没有搞清曾经的荣光岁月因何而成功，在自己团队本该最擅长的长期建队和进攻上不断摇摆，不断退化，最终跳水成为三流之选，并不冤枉。
以前看过我总结的朋友，这篇文章可能会出现大量你见到过的段落，就当是回顾一下往事吧。
一、什么应该是真正的弗格森理念？
这一次的文章，我们改一下顺序，首先讲明白，我们期待在弗格森以后的教练身上看到什么？要弄清楚这一点，不得不探讨：什么才是真正的弗格森理念？是全力进攻吗？是本土化吗？是坚持青训DNA吗？是前锋中卫扛大旗，边路两翼齐飞释放压力，中场只要会分边会站位就行吗？
如果你回想起弗格森懂权变、能屈能伸的战术变化，如果你回想起基恩、哈格里夫斯甚至弗莱彻短暂带来给曼联的腰板，如果你回想起范佩西、贝尔巴托夫、维迪奇、埃弗拉、年轻版C罗甚至争议极大的特维斯、范尼斯特鲁伊、基恩等等外来球员带来的比赛场面，恐怕你很难认同上述的任何一条。可惜的是，这些有争议的弗格森理念，一条不落地被现任曼联教练组奉若圭臬。
弗格森真正的理念是什么？我妄自揣摩，只有一个字，就是“赢”。如果用两个字形容的话，就是“求胜”。用更多字形容的话，就是管你用什么方法，怎么能赢怎么来。

本作最终BOSS 机械皇帝，可以说是效仿文艺复兴，实施了他的人类复兴。也就是他追求的人类再生『Human Renaissance』。


但在他眼里的文艺复兴，如同办家家酒已被贬得一文不值，根本不配冠以复兴之名。



机械皇帝制造的 B’T ，其原型是他在卫星内培养的人工生命体（Homunculus）！


Homunculus  的制法本就是文艺复兴时期的炼金术师所著。


这些被培养的细胞，又都被冠以了文艺复兴时期的众多天才之名。









其中孵化成功的仅有ラファエロ。音译有拉法罗或拉法尔。但此名字也正是文艺复兴后三杰中拉斐尔的名字。


机械皇帝距今700 多年前就已存在。因为十六世纪中期，他在佛罗伦萨遇到娜夏与米夏的时候，就已经存活了200年以上。






追溯回去，他出生以及成长的时期，正是处于文艺复兴的十四世纪。

即便是现在，想必也难以苟同。


但他对此的反馈是『对超出认知的东西，人们往往都会用恶魔来定义』。



人类的生命无永恒，可看作是被神所分配的行使权利。对于机械皇帝来说，或许这就是一种『封建制度』。


他毅然的举起了反『封建』的新文明运动的旗帜。只为创造一个他所谓的理想世界，一个以他为神的永生世界。


作为对抗机械皇帝的力量，首当其冲的是以中国神话四灵为模型的存在。


想必在ACG中，四神更为常见，且出境率更高也更讲究方位。



为何选择四灵不得而知。但四灵为瑞兽，有吉祥之兆，这或许是在暗示，四灵是为人类带来稳定吉祥的象征吧。


四灵又以麒麟为首，麒麟现身，也就代表了盛世安康。这可能也是，为什么麒麟是主角的原因之一。

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
This series is inspired by Wadzee and Luke TheNoteable Hardcore Minecraft Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it&#x27;s actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.

Introduction
Shaders
Setup
Shader Code
Conclusion
For those of you who love rabbit holes, learning graphics programming is a pretty deep one. There’s always some new thing to learn, there’s a bunch of different new languages and toolsets to know, and on top of all that, there’s math. Like anything else in programming, you pick up momentum with each new thing you build, so I found a tutorial and started making shaders. I know very little about this. However, I’m writing what I’m learning, so don’t come for me if I’m off on anything. 



A shader is a program that runs on the GPU as part of the graphics pipeline. We’re going to focus primarily on shaders in Unity. There are other ways to tackle this, but Unity gives an easy setup to get started quickly. For the context o…</span>

                    <span>Over two years ago (gulp), I posted a walkthrough of my Rust implementation of todo-mvp by @gypsydave5
 demonstrating how to build a simple Rust API without a framework.  The core functionality was built using hyper, a lower-level HTTP library instead of a full-blown framework.
It turns out I wrote that post about six months too early.  I published it in May 2019, and in November, Rust released 1.39.0 containing async/await syntax.  Womp womp.
My intent here was to simply upgrade the existing application to use the new syntax where applicable and call it a day.  But, you know that thing that happens when you go back and review code you wrote years ago?  Yeah, that thing happened. 
Our result functions almost identically to the implementation in the previous post, so some of this code will …</span>

When I did start bothering about it... what was my surprise when everywhere I saw they would just resize the screen and call it a day.
Granted, it was usually because one thing was being explained and most of the time... it will be enough...
Sometimes just resizing your desktop browser isn&#x27;t enough... you have to use it on the real thing.
And if that&#x27;s the case... what if I told you, you could have your desktop debugging experience in your phone? 
On your Android device, enable debugging

If you&#x27;re having trouble connecting, try unplugging and replugging it (seriously), also make sure &quot;Discover USB devices&quot; is checked.
After it&#x27;s on, you can click inspect or even open new tabs!

And you probably want to set up the port you&#x27;ll be using to be forwarded.

And that&#x27;s it!
You have the full experience of debugging straight from Chrome
If you use it from the phone, it&#x27;s reflected in the inspect window.

I spent this weekend playing around with Scala.js and learning how to manipulate browser cookies with it.
Check out the live demo at cookies.awwsmm.com.
The source is available at github.com/awwsmm/CookiesScalaJS.
There are a few cool Scala flairs here, particularly this bit which pattern matches on a regular expression
  def clearAllCookies(): Unit &#x3D; {
    val Cookie &#x3D; &quot;([^&#x3D;]+)&#x3D;.+&quot;.r
    document.cookie.split(&quot;; &quot;).foreach {
      case Cookie(key) &#x3D;&gt; clearCookie(key)
      case other &#x3D;&gt; err.println(s&quot;Couldn&#x27;t parse &#x27;$other&#x27; as a key&#x3D;value cookie pair&quot;)
    }
  }

In order to ensure that users don&#x27;t include the ; or &#x3D; characters in their cookie keys and values (which confuses the parser), I&#x27;ve also added these two little safeguards, as well
    // prevent the user from typing &#x27;;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; into the input
    input.addEventListener(&quot;keypress&quot;, (e: dom.KeyboardEvent) &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (e.key &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;;&quot; || e.key &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;&#x3D;&quot;) {
        e.preventDefault()
      }
    })

    // prevent the user from pasting &#x27;;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; into the input
    input.addEventListener(&quot;paste&quot;, (e: dom.ClipboardEvent) &#x3D;&gt; {
      val text &#x3D; e.clipboardData.getData(&quot;text&quot;)
      if (text.contains(&quot;;&quot;) || text.contains(&quot;&#x3D;&quot;)) {
        e.preventDefault()
      }
    })

What do you think? Anyone else on DEV doing anything cool with Scala.js?</span>

Typescript is superset of Javascript which means it is an extension of Javascript, adding new features and syntax on top of the core language.
Typescript is a strongly typed, object-oriented &amp; compiled language.
Typescript is designed to be compiled into fully compatible Javascript, so it works in any browser, any host, and any OS. 
We need typescript compiler to compile it to Javascript code because browsers do not understand typescript.
Typescript strongly encouraged static-typing which means it will validate all the assertions before the code executes. It allows you to do a type check during…</span>

At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about NFTs, but the more I dived into the NFT world, the more I was convinced about finishing my collection.
NFTs are unique tokens which can be images, videos, audio files, and any other types of digital files. NFTs are deployed on the blockchain and use blockchain technology to generate a public proof of ownership.
I didn&#x27;t create my NFTs for the money or the fame of being recognized. I did it for the learning process and what&#x27;s behind creating NFTs.

Some familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.
Arrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.
The Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.
Below is a typical example of how the filter function is used:
var arr1 &#x3D; [1,2,3,4],
    arr2 &#x3D; [2,4],
    res &#x3D; arr1.filter(item &#x3D;&gt; !arr2.includes(item));

console.log(res);

When this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array.

这篇文章从“五种特性”的角度向大家介绍我的Marginnote-Zotero学术写作工作流，Applescript脚本、Alfred插件以及Obsidian插件是连通这两样工具的桥梁。
我希望从阅读、摘录、整理、成稿的整个环节全面补齐Marginnote在学术写作方面的短板。有了Zotero的支持，Marginnote不再是无根之木、无源之水，而是处处有据可考、处处有证可依的内容发掘工厂与思维孵化器。。你可以在一个笔记本中绑定多篇pdf进行专题性的文献阅读，也可以先使用子脑图划分不同出处的摘录，最后再通过引用卡片，在新的框架中迭代整合，进而获得获得系统性的梳理文稿。
过去的“边写边引”变成“自动识别引用”、“自动生成参考文献列表”，阅读时分神来回切换阅读器和文献管理工具进行参阅和引用彻底成为过去式。以Markdown为载体的写作更专注于内容，结合Obsidian的Pandoc插件一键完成优雅的终稿排版。

                    <span>不少读者可能会有同时使用多个浏览器的习惯，比如在 Windows 上使用 Microsoft Edge、在 macOS 上使用 Safari、在移动端则使用 Chrome。在这种使用场景下，实现不同浏览器之间的书签同步也是个不小的需求——毕竟书签内容往往会随着我们的浏览行为发生变化，每次切换平台、浏览器都进行一次导出、导入还是比较麻烦。
作为一个多平台、多浏览器都在使用的用户，在今天的文章中我将分享一些能够在不同浏览器之间实现书签同步的解决方案。
Chrome、Edge 以及 Firefox 的书签同步
在桌面端，基于 Chromium 内核的浏览器（主要是 Chrome、Edge）与 Firefox 因为都有着丰富的扩展生态支持，因此也可以通过浏览器扩展来实现书签管理与同步。
个人比较推荐的是以下两款：
xBrowserSync
如果你想要开箱即用的多浏览器书签同步服务，最佳选择就是 xBrowserSync。
这款工具支持的浏览器包括 Firefox 以及各种基于 Chromium 的浏览器，只需在对应浏览器的扩展商店中搜索 xBrowserSync 并安装即可。

在扩展中点击 xBrowserSync 开始设置同步，直接点击 next 然后会让你输入对应的密码——之后服务会自动生成一个同步 ID，默认同步的服务器为主服务器，当然 xBrowserSync 也提供多个镜像同步服务器（服务器列表）方便我们进行选择，你可以根据具体的网络情况点击下方的 Switch Service 来切换到更为稳定的服务器。

输入两遍密码之后，你当前浏览器的书签会以书签文件的形式自动同步到 xBrowserSync 服务器中。点击扩展程序栏中的 xBrowserSync 图标，你可以对书签进行管理，设定相关的同步服务。比如对在线书签进行搜索、添加当前标签页为书签等等。

在系列的第三期文章《玩转 Obsidian 03：如何记录「间歇式日记」》中介绍过如何通过「间歇式日记」管理自己的日常工作和生活：

「间歇式日记」是著名的生产力教练 Coach Tony 在2017 年发表的《Replace Your To-Do List With Interstitial Journaling To Increase Productivity》文章中提出的一个概念。他认为「间歇式日记」可以更好的帮助自己集中精力更聪明的工作。「间歇式日记」既不同于常规的「日记」，也不同于常规的「任务管理软件」，它更强调围绕着「工作流」打造一个「正反馈描述」从而提高「生产力」。

「间歇式日记」的运作方式其实很简单，一句话总结：

在每个「工作间歇」，以「时间戳」为单位，采用类似「日记」的形式做的笔记。

在实际使用中「间歇式日记」也不会有太多负担，因为适当总结和梳理总是会帮助我们「理清现状」并开始下一个行动。但是，在使用「间歇式日记」一段时间后我发现了几个问题。
间歇式日记的问题
问题1：笔记优先法则 Vs 文件夹管理
在《玩转 Obsidian 04：为什么推荐使用 Obsidian 做知识管理》文章中专门提到 Obsidian 遵循「笔记优先法则」，这是它的优势之一：
笔记优先法则
「笔记优先法则」要求我们我们完全不需要考虑文件「存到哪里」这件事，只需要关注文件的「双向链接」以及 Tag 即可。并且借助 Obsidian 强大的搜索和关联能力，我们可以很方便的找到各种笔记。
在实际使用场景中，每天的「间歇式日记」经常要关联…</span>

                    <span>For a lot of useful State Related Hooks, Checkout my Library merced-react-hooks
To quick setup application wide state in your app just make a file called src/GlobalState.js in your react app.
GlobalState.js
import { useState, createContext, useContext } from &quot;react&quot;

// The initial state, you can setup any properties initilal values here.
const initialState &#x3D; {
    count: 0
}

// create the context object for delivering your state across your app.
const GlobalContext &#x3D; createContext(null)

// custom component to provide the state to your app
export const GlobalState &#x3D; props &#x3D;&gt; {
  // declare the GlobalState
  const [globalState, setGlobalState] &#x3D; useState({})

  // create a function that&#x27;ll make it easy to update one state property at a time
  const updateGlobalState &#x3D; (key, newValue) &#x3D;&gt; {
    setGlobalState(oldState &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (oldState[key] !&#x3D;&#x3D; newValue) {
        const newState &#x3D; { ...oldState }
        newState[key] &#x3D; newValue
        return newState
      } else {
        return oldState
      }
    })
  }

  return (
    {props.children}
  )
}

// custom hook for retrieving the provided state
export const useGlobalState &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; useContext(GlobalContext)

then you just have wrap your application with the GlobalState component in index.js

    


then in any component you can use the state. Below is an example of a counter component using the GlobalState.
import {useGlobalState} from &quot;../GlobalState.js&quot;

function Counter(props){

    const [globalState, updateGlobalState] &#x3D; useGlobalState()

    return 
{globalState.count}
 updateGlobalState(&quot;count&quot;, globalState.count + 1)}&gt;Add One
     updateGlobalState(&quot;count&quot;, globalState.count - 1)}&gt;Subtract One
    

}

There you go, now you can share state across your app in an easy that you can customize to your needs.</span>

                    <span>When you are working on a project, it is very useful to know the history of the modifications using git. If you are coding on Visual Studio Code like me, you should activate git blame by following these steps :
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Press Ctrl+Shift+X (windows) or ⇧⌘X (Mac)
- Type blame
- Click install on Git Blame
Now, you can see at the bottom of the vs code window who is responsible for the line of code you have your cursor on, as you can see on the image below: line 37 Sara Ounissi (that would be me), pushed this code 1 day ago.

However, the aim of this option is not just to see who wrote the code, but why and when. You can click on the name of the person, this will open a pop-in, the button View will then redirect you to the git repository where you will see the whole modification, the name of the commit, etc… Hopefully, that will help you get more context.</span>

So every now and then i see something that catches my eye. Recently that seems to be Linux Distributions, over the last few months i have changed my distribution&#x27;s a few times to try and find one i&#x27;m comfortable with. I moved from my iMac (getting a bit sluggish) to Ubuntu originally and it worked but i didn&#x27;t &quot;enjoy it&quot;, i then tried Manjaro, then Pop!_OS and then finally thought id have a go with Elementary OS.
So far i am really enjoying it! it feels a bit &quot;Mac&#x27;ish&quot;, Looks nice and feels quick!
But compared to Ubuntu its a little bit different with the Setup of the dev environment, so i thought id write up a little tutorial on setting a Laravel Dev Environment on Elementary OS.
So as with any tutorial i do with Linux, we start with an update/upgrade.

                    <span>Node.JS is a technology that has transformed JavaScript, which is familiar to all web developers, from a client-side scripting language to a general-purpose language that has a large number of application use cases.
 
At the heart of how Node works.js is asynchronous. In addition to non-blocking I / O, this allows a server-side application on Node.js can handle much more client requests per unit of time than a similar application developed on most other server-side development technologies.
What does this mean for your business?

                    <span>First let us get over with the debate of Authentication vs Authorization.
It is the process to verify if the user is telling the truth. For example: when we log into our account with some username and password, the process of verifying those credentials with the stored information in database and knowing that the user is really whom he/she claims to be is called Authentication.
It is a security process to know what information user has access to. Giving someone permission to download a particular file on a server or providing individual users with administrative access to an application are good examples of authorization.
In this article we are going to look into two different methods of User Authentication with NodeJS
Sesssion Based Authentication

                    <span>(This was a talk at The ephemeral miniconf, here are the slides)
Once upon a time, 
a guy named Larry Wall 
created a language called Perl.

He became the BDFL 
of this PL 
which values are TIMTOWTDI, 
DWIM, 
POLA 
and as all UNIXes: 
KISS 
and DOTADIW.

Perl enhances some key concepts 
of AWK, 
SED 
or GREP 
and even provides ACK 
and leads industry standard REGEX 
(PCRE).

PPL started to ❤️ Perl, 
meeting in PM groups 
and calling themself JAPH.

Eventually, big-sized meetings appeared 
like YAPC, 
TPC 
and TPRCIC 
(or chartreuse-sized ones like PTS).

There were also associations 
like TPF 
or EPO 
and individuals 
like YOU 
and ME.

FYI in 2021, 
I decided to organize TEM 
because hey, YOLO!

Technically speaking, 
you can say Perl 
or perl 
but not PERL 
nor the horrific PEARL... 😱

And if you don&#x27;t know, 
go on IRC 
and ask PURL! 🤖 

People say 
&quot;Only perl can parse Perl&quot; 
but there is PPI, 
PPR 
and PLS.

Interfacing w/ native extensions is easy 
with FFI, 
XS, 
SWIG 
or WASM 
(and even easier with NCI in Raku).

Perl lovers contribute 
to the CPAN w/ ❤️  
via PAUSE 
so Perl users can use CPANP, 
CPANM 
or CPM 
to DRY.

You can browse MetaCPAN 
for DBI, 
EUMM, 
MB, 
LWP 
or PDL 
or even some idiot ACME.

Each DIST 
contains a whole lot of DOC 
in a format named POD 
and even a dedicated RT Q.

If you&#x27;re in trouble, 
have a look at HOP 
or PBP.

IMHO 
it is a good PPT, 
but maybe a bit WTF... 
IDK 🤷
THX for attending 
and FWIW 
here is a well deserved GIF.

There are many pages wich explain what the Spread Operator (also know as three dots) and Rest Parameters are. 
It is an operator that I really like and I would like to share with you some ways that I use it.
📓 Spread Operator
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (print as array)

When we use the spread operator we get the values ​​independently:
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( ...numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; 1 2 3 4

Add an array to another:
let customers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27; ];
let otherCustomers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ];

customers.push( ...otherCustomers );
console.log( customers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27;, &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ]

Over the years, businesses have heavily customized IBM i applications to suit their business processes.
Most of these applications, however, run on an RPG code format that outputs to monolithic 5250 green screens. These screens contrast starkly with modern software expectations.
While 5250 green screens are effective, they don’t provide the rich UX-based experience users demand from modern software applications. In addition, because of the knowledge gap and dwindling talent pool of IBM i developers, most organizations run on multiple computing systems.

一起用代码吸猫！本文正在参与【喵星人征文活动】
事情的开始是这样的，带着我们家的两只小猫咪去一年一度打疫苗的时候顺便做了个小体检
结果猫1被诊断为缺水，医生说 RBC、HGB、HCT 指标都不正常有脱水的情况 问在家是不是不怎么喝水，因为家里有两只猫, 饮水机的水一直也有消耗但是你并不知道是被哪只猫喝了，回医生说不太清楚，说罢医生给了我这个工具
医生说要是它不喝水就用这个给它灌水！
回去给它灌了一针筒，场面堪比杀猫....
这工作没法干～
有没有办法监控它们的喝水情况呢？如果喝得不够再灌水，而且猫子们不会说话要是生病了不喝水了能不能及时发现？因为家里有多只毛孩子要是其他都正常喝有只不喝有没有办法及时发现呢？
👨：你也有脸说你知道你自己的身价吗？？？
看来只能做个监控工具来监控它们的喝水情况
今天你喝水了吗？ v0.0.1
方案框架如下

硬件设备准备
设备采集端用什么呢？ 废旧手机？树莓派？ 其他廉价IoT设备？
基于成本考虑以及硬件扩展我选了ESP32 CAM 万能淘宝价 25-35一大把大概长这样

这个板子比较坑的的是没有usb接口，作为垃圾大佬的我翻出一个cp2102 转接口接上
实物接线后长这样（建议购买CP2102兼容性好一些，淘宝上另外一个是CH340便宜一些但是兼容性更差一些

服务端设备
服务端用什么呢？ 拿出了我多年收集的吃灰套装

小公鸡点到谁我就选谁～
软件部分方案
设备端使用Arduino吧，网上资源丰富
AI部分采用Pytorch， 模型的话可以考虑用MobileNet 或者 SqueezeNet，
推理端也可以用Pytorch，也可以用淘宝出品的MNN 不仅在手机端上性能出众，在树莓派上也可以跑
服务端部分可以采用蚂蚁的Eggjs 前端展示还是App吧毕竟我是一个落魄的Android开发🐶～

水一篇
这个应该是今年最后一篇文章了，卷累了打算明年在卷了。
年中的时候帮部门招人，发现很多候选人对于我们部门还是很青睐的。也对鸡架部门做的事比较感兴趣，所以今天这篇水文主要就给大家梳理下基架的面试题以及基础架构组涉及的sdk相关。
因为最近几年面试经常被人吊打，所以也有了总结面试题的习惯。之后加上之前帮候选人的面试总结，今天给大家再卷一波。
也不是别的啥就是想要毛面试题的流量了呢。
SDK相关
面试的时候我觉得哦，这些sdk有任意其实你研究的比较深入就行了，应该能在面试中表现的很好了。还有就是个人建议最好还是在单一方向研究的更深入一点，别的只要大概知道干什么的就行了。
配置中心以及灰度测试
app必备工具之一，配置中心主要负责的就是动态化的配置，比如文本展示类似这些的。sdk提供方需要负责的是提供动态更新能力，这里有个差异化更新，只更新dif部分，还有就是流量优化等等需要开发同学考虑的。然后可以考虑下存储性能方面的提升等。
而abtest也是app必备工具之一了，动态的下发实验策略，之后开发同学可以切换实验的页面。另外主要需要考虑灰度结果计算，分桶以及版本过滤白名单等等。这里只是一个简单的介绍不展开，因为我只是一个使用方。
调试组件
个人还是更推荐滴滴的Dokit，功能点比较多而且接入相对来说比较简单。而且提供了很多给开发同学定制的能力，可以在debug情况下增加很多业务相关的测试功能，方便测试同学，核心还是浮窗太方便了。
当然很多实验性的预研功能等其实都可以直接接在这里，然后在测试环境下充分展开，之后在进行线上灰度方案。还有一些具有风险的hook操作，个人也比较建议放在debug组件上。
性能监控框架
这部分有几个不同的方面，首先是异常崩溃方面的，另外则是性能监控方面的，但是他们整体是划分在一起的，都属于线上性能监控体系的。

                    <span>掐指算来，Apple 正式将其桌面端设备的系统架构从 X86 转移到 ARM 也已经有一年左右的时间。这个过程之中 Apple 不仅通过 Rosetta 2 巧妙地解决了原来 X86 应用的兼容性问题，与此同时越来越多的应用开发商也适时地更新应用加入了对 Apple silicon 的原生支持。但对应的则是硬件架构上带来的封闭——虽然提供了所谓的一整套虚拟化实现接口，但一年多来支持 Apple silicon 的虚拟化软件却屈指可数。
作为 Mac 平台上较为老牌的商业虚拟化软件，VMware Fusion 在推进基于 M1 架构 Mac 虚拟机应用的进展却一直不快，一直到 2021 年 9 月才推出了首个技术预览版。再对比今年四月初就已推出基于 M1 架构正式版虚拟化软件的 Parallels Desktop，VMware Fusion 对于个人用户而言最大的优势可能就是免费了。
VMware Fusion 更新之后，我也在第一时间下载了 VMware Fusion 首个基于 M1 架构技术测试版，来看看这款商业虚拟化软件在 M1 架构下的表现如何。
能安装哪些系统
因为基于 ARM64 架构，因此和 Parallels Desktop 类似，VMware Fusion for Apple silicon Public Tech Preview 也只支持同架构下的系统模拟。也就是说，安装的虚拟机系统也必须是基于 ARM64 的。
但相比 Parallels Desktop 官方原生支持 Windows ARM64，VMware Fusion for Apple silicon Public Tech Preview 明确说明将不会「官方」支持 ARM64 架构的 Windows 系统，仅支持基于 ARM64 的 Linux 发行套件。官方给出的解释则是微软并没有推出零售版…</span>

天气渐渐转凉，吃得也比以前多了起来。但吃归吃，还是不希望自己发胖或影响身体健康。接触「Locabo Diet 低糖质饮食」的概念有一段时间，也进行了相关尝试，但因为我并不是会做饭的人，所以想分享一下市面上就能轻松购买到的相关好物。只需简单的替换，就能减少许多糖和热量的摄入。
什么是 Locabo，什么是糖质
Locabo 严格意义上是日本一个 健康协会 的登录商标，名称来源于 low-carbohydrate（低碳水饮食），但观念有所不同，他们不提倡极端控制碳水，而是适量、健康、美味地进行摄取，因此称自己为 Locabo。

糖质指的是碳水化合物中去除不参与代谢的食物纤维，其他的能参与代谢、产生能量的部分。

Locabo 协会认为现代人饮食中摄取的糖质太多了。一餐饭中，两个饭团+一杯蔬果汁就有 100 g 糖质，而健康的糖质摄取量应该为一餐 20-40 g，再加上加餐 10 g，一天的摄入量应该控制在 70-130 g 之间。
为此，需要做到：1. 米饭半碗；2. 多吃菜、鱼、肉；3. 使用低糖质的甜味剂代替砂糖。综合实践下来，采用低糖质替代品来减糖还是相对容易的，但减少主食的摄入量可能不那么容易，尤其是胃口大的人。不过不要紧，我们可以采用 Locabo 的部分理念来践行减糖活动。
万变不离其宗：无热量甜味剂取代砂糖

                    <span>Even though Apple is slowly migrating from the Lightning port to USB Type-C, many of its older and existing devices still use the Lightning port for charging and data transfer. And the company supplies a Lightning cable with pretty much every product that needs it, but Apple cables are notoriously flimsy and very often break.

                    <span>大家好，我是游戏的作者炒饭。
发布的这个星期情绪波动很大，补了一个长觉到现在终于缓过来了。
到现在为止，游戏卖了大概两万份，很多很多了
虽然距离回本还有距离（抱歉，我烧太多）但希望还是有的。


至于怎么评价自己的游戏，现在还没办法说。
目前的状态很像刚刚考完试的学生，对一切还是懵的。
做项目很像考试，不同的环节是不同的题。


有些题你有把握，做的很顺畅；有的题没把握，瞎写了个答案。
有的题目不会但你蒙对了，有些题本来可以对粗心做错了。
还有些题呢，超出了你的能力范畴，想蒙个答案都不知道怎么写。


反正现在成绩出来了，分数还行。
之前做好了不及格的准备，做好了暴死的准备。
后路也准备好了，简历写了好几份，打工的地方也联系过。
现在看来……虽然中间一波三折，但暂时应该不用去打工了。


回过头看去，项目里问题很多，
系统的，设计上的，剧本里节奏的，人物设计上的都有。
还有大家很诟病的结局，结尾的都合降神，段子太多建政水平低，
这些问题无法辩驳，狡辩找理由也没啥意义。


借口也好找——受限于时间也受限于水平，
就像考试的时候遇到难题，超出了你的水平和知识储备，
这种题你只能强行答，答完了检查多少遍，也未必能改对。


接着往下说估计又要开始哭穷了，说点梦想啊之类的场面话，
但这两年大家都不容易，谁都穷，谁也都有梦想。
与其说那些，不如说点更有意思的。


其实最早这是个卖萌的游戏，篇幅很短（2-3小时时长），
当时手上钱不多，做外包垫了一些钱回不来，不敢做规模大的企划。
正好去日本旅游（购物旅行团）了几天，认识了很多做代购的大妈，
那几天梦见自己去阴间做代购，代购什么黄泉化妆品孟婆汤阴间树叶。
后来就根据这个写了个小故事，男主角是个骗子，骗了个兔子精去做代购。
故事也没啥主题，就是纯卖萌，日常，搞笑，带点小温馨。


然后剧本我刚开了个头，疫情来了。作为武汉人很崩溃。

  What is Open edX® ?


Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:
Ansible Playbooks which has 1 or multiple roles. Imaging Playbook as full instructions on how to install your software, it&#x27;s components and how the set them up to work properly.
Ansible Roles. Each component in your stack has it&#x27;s own role. for example if your are using Djang…</span>

Last week in class we added automated testing to our Static Site Generators (mine is called textToHTML). This included some tests for Jest which make sure the core functionality of our programs work as expected.
After writing our tests, if you run npm run test from the command line it will run the tests. But... what if someone who is contributing to your repository forgets to run the tests before committing? 
Introducing continuous integration (I&#x27;m using the GitHub version). 
This allows you to set up a .github folder containing a .yml file to configure your tests to run automatically on any push or pull request to your repository. The above linked article shows step by step how to set up the configuration folder and file for either Node.js or Python.

                    <span>YouTube is testing changes in its platform that could affect one of the most classic indicators about the temperature of a video: dislikes. From their Twitter account they explained that these are some new design changes in which the amount of dislikes on videos will not be shown, but curiously the button will remain there.
At the moment, YouTube says that this will be a &quot;small experiment&quot; that some users may see during the next few weeks. However, creators will still be able to see the exact number of &#x27;likes&#x27; and &#x27;dislikes&#x27; from YouTube Studio.
The equivalent of &quot;review bombing&quot; on YouTube, these are campaigns where users go en masse to click the &#x27;dislike&#x27; button on a video. YouTube says it has implemented this change after talking to creators who have been victims of such campaigns.

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Nov. 18th, we had our first Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 1. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.
How do you currently collect user experience data?
What works well with your approach? 
What&#x27;s still challenging?
Megan Sullivan and Amber Matz both mentioned feedback widgets embedded in the docs they worked on. These widgets ask if the page was helpful. They also offer an open text field to add more comments. 
Sarah Rainsberger and I both mentioned receiving feedback from our communities directly.

                    <span>After several weeks of writings about Kubernetes, I want to write a short post about React, about libraries, because man can not live only on Kubernetes. 
These are some of the libraries that I consider most useful and cool in React. For obvious reasons, React-router, Redux, and other well-known ones are excluded. As well as some React Frameworks such as Gatsby, Nextjs, Frontity, and others.
Ant Design
Ant design is beautiful, yes, there is not much that can be deepened using text. It has tons of components that are visually pleasing and very stylish: buttons, sliders, progress bars, layouts, you know, the basics. Make sure to visit their site and see for yourself all that Ant design has to offer when you are done reading this post, of course.

Docker has quickly become an essential platform for application containerization. By empowering developers to rapidly deploy apps and host them in the cloud, Docker has simplified the dev cycle by expediting the process of building scalable, modern applications.
Docker Compose
Compose For Local Development
Docker Compose takes the convenience of containers one step further, by streamlining each service’s building and runtime config into a single process. With Compose, it’s as simple as:
Define how to build your app’s services with a 
Dockerfile
Define how to run your app’s services in the 
docker-compose.yaml
Build and run your app with docker-compose up
Compose also allows devs to configure mount volum…</span>

本周话题：政府的存储需求有多大？
最近，有一条新闻吸引了我的注意。
美国达拉斯警察局迁移内部数据，不小心误删了 22TB 的数据，后来找回 14TB，剩下的 8TB 确认丢失。
丢失的数据里面，有一个谋杀案的所有文档、图像、视频。证据没了无法起诉，而嫌疑人又不认罪，警方正在讨论怎么办，最后很可能只能把他放了。

大家觉得上面这条新闻，什么地方值得注意？
不是误删数据，那种事情每天都在发生。我觉得，重点是警察局的数据超过了 22TB。这个容量不算小，说明它的硬盘保存了很多东西，而且应该是有一个自己的存储系统，搞不好还有机房。
达拉斯的人口是130多万，警察局的存储超过了 22TB，整个美国的人口是3亿多，你说所有警察局的存储空间加在一起，该有多大？
美国的警察局属于州政府，国家一级的治安机关是联邦调查局 FBI，它的存储恐怕更大，此外还有其他政府部门（比如国防部、财政部、中央情报局......）。这么一想，美国政府单位消耗的硬盘真是不得了，恐怕是一个天文数字。

我接着想到，中国政府单位的存储需求，也是天文数字吧。好在这可以查，政府采购需要招标，招标公告一般发布在政府采购网。

我全文搜索&quot;存储&quot;，过去半年有11431条采购公告。

各省的各种单位都有，采购金额从几十万到几百万不等，大家可以去看。我随便摘录几条。

[美剧] 黄石 第四季

关键词：剧情 / 西部
片长：50 分钟（单集）× 7 集；豆瓣链接

民风淳朴哥谭市，热情好客黄石人～

@潘誉晗：相信不少剧迷都认为《黄石》是更加现实的《西部世界》，的确，比起后者，在一个游戏世界中建立秩序寻找人性这样的设定，《黄石》是更为接近西部荒蛮却真实的存在。它包括家族、政治、不同立场之间的斗争，也不乏西部的野性和叛逆。
剧集围绕达顿家族展开，当家人约翰是坐拥全美最大牧场黄——石牧场的牧场主，而牧场得天独厚的地理位置和自身发展所带来的巨大财富，自然也引来了许多人的觊觎。比如企图把这里发展成新城市的开发商；认为这里应该属于印第安人的拥有印第安血统的政治家；还有想分一杯羹的政府。在…</span>

                    <span>在如今的日常生活中，我们总是离不开各式各样的 App。你也许并不喜欢这个 App，但往往又陷入「不得不用」的困境。你或许不知道，我们每天都在用的这些 App，它们却藏着许多实用的小功能。这篇文章就将带大家一同探寻那些每日 App 中的「隐藏操作」，希望能帮你提升这些 App 的使用体验。
小……功能做的不错的微信
提到「每日 App」，小而美微信或许是许多人又爱又恨的存在。虽然大家总在吐槽微信的各种限制，但作为「国民级 App」的它也确实有着一些鲜为人知的实用功能。
发送视频不被压缩
想必不少人都曾因微信发送视频时被压缩、损伤画质的事情而苦恼，再加上有文件大小在 100M 以内的限制，当不得不在微信传输视频文件时，我们需要借助一些外部的网盘等 App 才能实现。
在对话框中选择下方的文件，打开后在上方切换需传输的文件的位置，可以是手机相册或者是来自 iCloud（Android 则会显示为「手机存储」），即可将视频直接以「文件」的格式发送，无损画质也没有大小限制。

对于有些打工人来说，尽管非常抗拒使用微信办公，有时候也会被迫使用微信接收或者发送文件，甚至常会出现你和你的同事在飞书、企业微信等 OA 软件办公，但却需要将文件在微信上发送给老板。
虽然对于明明有 OA 但非要用微信的行为不理解，作为一个人在屋檐下的打工人却别无他法，比如我们公司，明明电脑上没有权限安装微信，却总有同事要在微信里拉群发送消息。
对于以上这种场景，用手机上的微信传送电脑文件变成了一个强需求，这时候可以先将文件传到 iCloud 云盘，再从「微信 - 文件 - iCloud」中发送，文件大小也没有限制（传输速度比百度网盘快得多），即使发送的文件为压缩包，只要手机里有安装对应的解压软件，也可以打开。

值得一提的是，iOS 上有不少应用都支持了 iCloud Drive，你可以直接在「文件」应用的「浏…</span>

党的十八大以来，习近平总书记对文艺工作高度重视，对文艺工作者亲切关怀，给文艺界以巨大鼓舞和有力鞭策。
中国文艺网特别推出“喜迎第十一次全国文代会”栏目，在“牢记重托 不负期望”系列中邀请知名文艺家讲述当面聆听习近平总书记重要讲话或者收到总书记致信回信的切身感受，表达牢记重托、不负期望，繁荣发展文艺事业、推动文化强国建设的决心与信心。


本期推出中国文联荣誉委员、中国戏剧家协会名誉主席、著名京剧表演艺术家尚长荣专访。
中国文联荣誉委员、中国戏剧家协会名誉主席、著名京剧表演艺术家尚长荣
2014年，习近平总书记亲自主持召开文艺工作座谈会并发表重要讲话。尚长荣是现场发言的7位文艺家之一。
2020年，习近平总书记给中国戏曲学院师生回信。尚长荣是中国戏曲学院老中青少四代师生代表之一。
在习近平总书记讲话、回信精神鼓舞下，年逾八旬的尚长荣依然活跃在舞台上，为中华优秀传统文化传承创新不懈奔忙。他说，习近平总书记给广大文艺家、文艺工作者增添了信心、传递了能量、给予了动力。戏曲工作者要更加坚定文化自信，在守正创新的基础上，不断发扬中华优秀戏曲文化。
访谈
中国文艺网：2014年，习近平总书记亲自主持召开文艺工作座谈会。您是现场发言的7位文艺家之一。能和我们谈一谈您的发言情况吗？
尚长荣：那次会议我记忆犹新。我是第二个发言的。汇报完毕后，习近平总书记和我进行了交流。他提到了我主演的《贞观盛事》《廉吏于成龙》，认为很有现实针对性，能够起到启迪、警示的作用，支持我们继续搞好这方面的工作。
中国文艺网：习近平总书记在文艺工作座谈会上发表了重要讲话，您个人感觉对我国戏曲事业和戏曲工作者来说具有什么样的意义？

为什么全世界都在关注中国？清华大学国家战略研究院资深研究员谢茂松告诉观察者网，中国现在是世界经济最大的引擎。而中国共产党是引领中国经济的重要因素，国际社会当然会对中国崛起和中国共产党未来的路线进行「特别关照」。另外，「中国又不同于美国的「功利主义」，中国打造的是共同体，带动比如发展中国家共同发展。所以全世界都在关注中国」。

                    <span>非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
这场比赛的焦点，在于浓眉对字母在攻防两端的表现。相比起字母哥的在球场两端的发挥，浓眉看上去似乎落了下风。“美国杨毅”史密斯怒斥了浓眉的“回击乏力”，虎扑湖人区更是以“浓眉夺冠赛季后的堕落不自律”为主题，进行了心理与身体状态上的大讨论。然而，如果细究比赛进程，从全局出发，浓眉在进攻端还是发挥出了重要的作用，而在防守端对字母的防守丢分，也更多来自于一种体系中定位的无奈。相应地，威少的进攻端表现则受到了沃格尔的表扬，“打出了湖人生涯最好的一场比赛”。
那么，浓眉的作用是如何发挥的？威少的表现上升，与浓眉有无关联？本场比赛的湖人，是否有一些让人看到一些希望——他们最需要这个，最起码得有“盼头”——的比赛内容呢？

在这支湖人队中，浓眉的防守任务是非常沉重的。在近期的比赛中，湖人常规性地使用了三后卫的阵容。这一排法，当然是为了在现有资源的现实前提下、尽量为威少缓解防守压力。本赛季，威少在防守挡拆持球人时，平均每回合让对手得到0.83分，每场需要完成3.6个回合，占他总防守比例的35.1%.而同队的布拉德利与里弗斯，防守挡拆的回合数比威少还略多0.1和0.2，每回合对手得分只有0.79和0.57分。
而在防守轮转后的弱侧盯人中，威少也往往难以做出正确的判断----他已经在执行湖人防守体系的换防要求，大量增加了防守中的移动，每个防守回合中的移动距离排名队内第一，并非在每个回合中都是蹲篮下等待篮板的懒散存在，但却由于对进攻阅读的不准、防守沟通的不力，他在移动上往往显得犹犹豫豫、去而复返，无效跑动很多，加上运动能力的消耗，便很难执行出坚决、效率的到位换防，防守端的平均移动速度排名队内倒数第三。这就导致了威少在防守端制造的“窟窿”效果：上场时，对手每百回合可以得到109.9分，而下场后湖人反而压到了103.8分。

威少在场上的正向作用主要是进攻端的球权消化，在防…</span>

I started to install PWA plugin, but Docusaurus, I had some version not matching issue. It turns out that the current project is using an older version of Docusaurus (2.0.0-beta.2). The PWA plugin version has to match the version of Docusaurus to work.
I created another pull request for upgrading Docusaurus to version (2.0.0-beta.8). After the pull request got merged, I can start working on the PWA feature.
To implement PWA, we first need an icon for 192x192  and 512x512. After that, we need to create a manifest.json to add all the settings for PWA.

                    <span>Introduction


While waiting for reviews in my recent pull request, I decided to find a different project. After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.
A quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties&#x27; blogs about anything open-source. 
For my task, I had to customize Telescope&#x27;s build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:
Add header and side navigation bar
Change side navigation default logo into Telescope logo
Update link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./




  
  
  Working on the issue


After setting up the development environment using Telescope&#x27;s documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.
I began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn&#x27;t break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. 
Since I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn&#x27;t break or miss anything.
Similar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.
Cheers! 🍻</span>

Wondering, what&#x27;s up with this weird ancient art? Well, they help portray how civilization evolved much like how we learned to evolve our ways to talk to machines. Like us humans divided our society to do specific tasks say carpenters to work with wood, barbers to trim our hairs, similarly, we can ask machines to work specifically on something or take a specific action when some work is given. As an example imagine, when we wake up, we follow the below step -
Get your bed done &gt; Brush your teeth &gt; Wash your face &gt; Dry your face
For machines, these are described as functions. To understand what a function is imagine a set of instructions that needs to be done when something happens.

                    <span>For release 0.3, I started to contribute on Heptagram repo. The notice that they migrated their website into React. I found out that they do not have prettier set up for the new React project. So I created an issue and asked to be assigned to work on that issue ✨❓ Feature Request: Add Prettier config. 
I first started to install prettier, and add a script for it, one for checking and the other one for writing.
 &quot;prettier&quot;: &quot;prettier --write \&quot;./**/*.{md,jsx,json,html,css,js,yml}\&quot;&quot;,
 &quot;prettier-check&quot;: &quot;prettier --check \&quot;./**/*.{md,jsx,json,html,css,js,yml}\&quot;&quot;

After that, I made .prettierrc.json and add some rules.
{
    &quot;arrowParens&quot;: &quot;always&quot;,
    &quot;bracketSpacing&quot;: true,
    &quot;embeddedLanguageFormatting&quot;: &quot;auto&quot;,
    &quot;endOfLine&quot;: &quot;lf&quot;,
    &quot;htmlWhitespaceSensitivity&quot;: &quot;css&quot;,
    &quot;insertPragma&quot;: false,
    &quot;jsxSingleQuote&quot;: false,
    &quot;proseWrap&quot;: &quot;preserve&quot;,
    &quot;quoteProps&quot;: &quot;as-needed&quot;,
    &quot;requirePragma&quot;: false,
    &quot;singleQuote&quot;: true,
    &quot;tabWidth&quot;: 4,
    &quot;trailingComma&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,
    &quot;useTabs&quot;: false,
    &quot;vueIndentScriptAndStyle&quot;: false,
    &quot;printWidth&quot;: 100
}

I committed and pushed my change to remote, then I created a PR for asking if the prettier format is ok before I run a prettier on all files which change the whole project file format. 
After receiving confirmation that everything is okay. I run npm run prettier to change all the files and commit my change then after a few hours my PR got merged.</span>

                    <span>But why do we need it?


As the frontend becomes larger, while holding multiple domains of responsibilities (for example — navigation, user, authorization, e. g. ), the frontend application is developed, deployed and hosted as a single application. 
Micro-frontends allows us to use those different applications not just on the code base, but also in development, deployment and serve, in order to provide:
Loosely coupled applications
Faster development, debugging, and testing flows
Performance — smaller chunks
Full Isolation while testing, developing, and deploying

During this article we will review the frontend application that is built out of the shell and 3 applications that represent a domain:

                    <span>Changing your company&#x27;s culture can be difficult, especially if you are persuading your boss, company, or leadership team to open source a project. The hard truth is that businesses care about finances, specifically how to acquire and retain money.  Their concerns are valid. Without financial stability and growth, the company is at risk of coming to a halt, which affects its employees and customers. The goal of a business is to stay in business. Perhaps, you understand that, and you see that open sourcing a project will help the company thrive more, but you&#x27;re unsure how to help your employer recognize the value in open sourcing a project.
Here are four concerns your boss may have and responses you can use to alleviate their worries:

                    <span>Yesterday evening I went to my first software development Meetup. I was hesitating in going because I&#x27;m sort of an introvert and going into a room full of strangers is not what I imagine when I think about doing something fun. Fortunately, I pushed myself to go, thinking that, at least, I would listen to what the speakers had to say.
To my surprise, I enjoyed the experience quite much. I didn&#x27;t do much networking, but I could see and hear about people from different backgrounds trying to start (and continue) their careers in software development. The Meetup was focused on junior developers, so the discussion was focused on how to get jobs and the first steps after getting a job. I was glad to know many recommended a process to land jobs that are very similar to the one I followed to get my…</span>

                    <span>Django is a top Python web-framework known for its features, scalability, and flexibility.
In this guide, we&#x27;ll walk through how you can deploy your Django projects with Cleavr.io.
Before proceeding, you&#x27;ll need to have an active Cleavr.io account and have a server provisioned and ready-to-go.
Add a new NodeJS SSR site to your server in Cleavr.
We&#x27;re using NodeJS SSR as the site&#x27;s app type as it will install Node AND PM2 to the server. PM2 manages more than just node applications, so we&#x27;ll take advantage of this to serve our Django app and keep it alive.
In the Django project, locate the settings.py file, or wherever you have ALLOWED_HOSTS defined, and add the domain used in the previous step to the list of allowed hosts.
For example, this is what our example looks like:

We previously made a post about all of our favourite keyboard shortcuts that can help everyone make their daily workflow easier. Now we want to give the developers our favourite shortcuts to make working with your code a breeze. 
We&#x27;re big fans of Visual Studio Code at CodeCast, so I can only say for sure that some of these work on there, but working on virtual code editors, I have had most of them work for me with no issue. So, without further ado, let&#x27;s get started listing some of our favourite keyboard shortcuts for developers.

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第18天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
前言
在 Dart 编码中，我们会经常遇到需要处理 null 的场合。Dart 2.12版本引入 null safety 以后，对 null 的处理有了新的规范。关于 null safety 特性，可以阅读本人的另一篇文章：升级踩坑，聊聊 Dart 的 null safety，本篇介绍如何正确处理 null。
规范1：不要显式地将变量初始化为 null
如果一个变量声明的时候是 non-null 的话，赋值为 null 时，编译器会报错；而如果一个变量声明为 nullable 的话，会隐式地以 null 初始化，因此如果再赋值 null 那就是多此一举了。在 Dart 中不存在未初始化的内存问题，因此没必要初始化为 null。
// 正确示例
Item? bestDeal(List cart) {
  Item? bestItem;
  // ...
}

// 错误示例
Item? bestDeal(List cart) {
  Item? bestItem &#x3D; null;
  // ...
}

规范2：不要为函数参数设置 null 默认值
如果设置一个函数的参数是 nullable 的话，同样的，也会隐式地复制 null，因此没必要重复设置默认值。
// 正确示例
void error([String? message]) {
  print(message ?? &#x27;未知错误&#x27;);
}

// 错误示例
void error([String? message &#x3D; null]) {
  print(message ?? &#x27;未知错误&#x27;);
}

规范3：使用 ?? 操作符将 null 转换为布尔值

今年双十一到手的第一个大货，就是 realme 新发布的第一款智能穿戴产品 T1 手表。T1 共有三种配色，传统的橄榄绿和活力黑，以及颇有 realme 特色的黑薄荷（OPPO 商城独占）。我买到的是橄榄绿配色。

我之前用过的智能手环 / 手表只有三只：索尼 SWR30 手环、跃我（Amazfit）GTR 手表和 OPPO 手环（时尚版），所以我这里比较的对象主要就是它们仨，其它产品我了解得不够全面，如有说错，欢迎大家和气指出。

买这只 T1，对于我个人来说主要原因有这么几个方面：

我的主力手机是 realme X50 Pro，自家的东西理应配合得天衣无缝对吧；
可以离线听歌。据我所知，目前市面上可以离线听歌的安卓手表，价格都要一千起步，T1 标准价 699 首发 599，这个价格太有竞争力了；
可以接听手机。这个功能其实我不太需要（把手腕抬到嘴边说话还有点特工的意思，举到耳边则看起来有点尴尬）；
支持 110 种运动方式（有必要吗？），该有动力运动起来了吧；
最重要的，好看。Realme 的设计风格是冲着年轻人去的，设计师水平也不低，比荣耀、跃我之类的中老年手表好看太多了。

                    <span>这是个信息轰炸的时代，除了必要的信息过滤手段外，每个人都应该构建属于自己的个人知识库。
一、个人数据库避坑指南
前两天有个用户给我邮件问了一些问题，我觉得非常有意思，也很有代表性，所以聊聊这个事情。
为免隐私问题，我把一些内容打码了，请勿对号入座。
使用过笔记类软件的朋友都知道，这位朋友遇到的可能是一个共性问题，也就是：我们自己的笔记究竟该如何处理才最方便、最有助于个人成长？不同的软件有不同的理念，有的服务注重开放性，能够与市面上的其他服务共通，便于定制自己的知识空间；有的软件则认为自己的知识整理理念独一无二且非常优秀，因此相对封闭，便于吸引用户且留住用户。在这篇文章中，针对笔记和知识整理领域，我们来共同探讨关于个人数据整理的问题：

究竟什么样的个人数据存储方案才是好的？
如何构建适合自己的数据存储空间？
构建自己的个性化服务应该注意哪些内容？

1. All-in-one VS All-in-all

先来看第一个问题：什么样的存储方式才是「好」的？
现在是 21 世纪，因为疫情，云服务在这两年大热。在这两年，不少云存储服务也百花齐放。但说到存储，首先要搞清楚我们要存储些什么东西？既然是要存，我们希望的自然是能够「在我想要的时候找到它」，减少损坏、降低遗失的几率。各家云服务为我们提供了随时获取自己数据的权利，但也带来一个问题，那就是：我们存到云端的数据，还是我们的吗？随着不少云服务供应商的政策变化，我们越来越注意到，放在云端，虽然方便获取，但也方便丢失了。靠谱的供应商还给你数据导出和备份的机会，不靠谱的，直接关掉你的账户，你的数据、记忆、情感、心血，可能一瞬间就灰飞烟灭。所以，这两年回归本地仓储的声音也越来越高。因为，放到云里，实在太不稳定了。
那么，多备份几份数据不就好了？
是这样，一个服务商丢了，我们可以从另一家获取。我的还是我的。这就是 All-in-all 的存…</span>

                    <span>浏览器是我们网上冲浪必不可少的工具之一，不管你在用的是哪一款，新标签页往往都是我们进入网络世界的重要入口。因此市面上已经有了不少对新标签页进行美化或增强的第三方扩展程序，比如少数派介绍过的 Momentum、Infinity 等。这些新标签页扩展很多又会以「个性化定制」为卖点，我们在点开浏览器图标的同时，只属于自己的网络浏览体验就已经准备好了。

也正是因为类似的原因，Google 近日推出的 Tab Maker 才如此具有吸引力——作为 Chrome 背后的缔造者，Google 推出的这款小工具将选择权完全交给用户，让我们即便没有任何代码基础也能制作一款只属于自己的新标签页扩展。

和大多数「零代码」工具一样，Tab Maker 为我们提供了非常直观的分步引导和图形化定制界面。在 Tab Maker 官网选择 Make your own 进入在线编辑器页面后，我们首先需要从 11 种预置模板中选择一种进行编辑（也可以导入其它人分享过来的 .zip 文件）。

随后 Tab Maker 会引导我们创建一个用于页面内容搭建的 Google Sheet 表格模板。我们此刻需要做的是生成一份这份表格的副本，并将其保存到自己的 Google Drive 存储中。

然后就是在 Google Sheet 中自由发挥的时候了：

表格中每一行都代表着一个标签页，我们可以为其添加上页面的背景图片、在每个区块中添加上我们想添加的文字或图片（图片需为链接的形式）
也可以为每个区块附加上超链接，这样区块就具备了点击跳转至目标链接的能力

为了避免大家在 Google Sheet 和 Tab Maker 中来回跳转，表格的左上角还贴心地加上了我们选择的模板样式缩略图。
编辑完表格内容后，接下来我们需要将表格转为公开形式：依次点击左上角菜单 File &gt; Share &gt; Publish to we…</span>

                    <span>很多人都会在浏览器收藏夹里常备一个网速测试工具。每当连上一个新网络需要测试效果，或是感觉网络卡顿需要排查故障，这类工具就能派上用场。
但是，这个「裁判员」的选择并不应该是随意的。如果用运营商提供的测速页面，则只能反应到城域网关这一小段的连通性，以此代表实际网速无异于自欺欺人；另一方面，如果测速平台的规模太小，经常匹配到一个远在天边的节点，也会出现「误诊」的问题。
目前，比较常见的选择是 Ookla 旗下的 Speedtest.net；Netflix 开设的 fast.com 也被广泛使用。但是，就国内使用而言，前者并非在所有城市都能找到合适的测速节点，而后者的可访问性则较差。
好消息是，从今年的 macOS Monterey 开始， macOS 已经内置了一个网络情况测试工具 networkQuality。这个工具利用 Apple 遍布全球的 CDN（内容分发网络）服务器来测速，比较客观准确，在很多场景下可以免去寻找第三方工具的麻烦。同时，它还会对当前网络的拥堵情况作出直观的高低评价，帮你快速估测此地是否适合打电话、玩游戏。
基本使用
networkQuality 是一个命令行工具，需要使用「终端」App（或者你首选的其他终端模拟器）运行。方法是：
首先，点按「程序坞」（Dock）中的「启动台」（LaunchPad）图标，在搜索栏中键入「终端」，然后点按「终端」图标。
（或者，在「访达」中，打开 /应用程序/实用工具 文件夹，然后双击「终端」。）
在打开的终端窗口中，输入 networkQuality（注意大小写），然后回车。

此时，系统会开始同时测试下载和上传速度，并将当前速率实时显示在终端窗口中，形如：
current download capacity: 247.850 Mbps - current upload capacity: 9.545 Mbps

                    <span>平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。
首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。
《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。
其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。
然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）
1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。

游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。
2. 关于形状的错觉。

一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。
3. 颜色的错觉。


这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）
4. 负空间。

在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。
5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）

虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。
6. 倒影或平面变成实体

挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。
7. 透过遮罩的场景

我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？
8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方

这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。
游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。
第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。

                    <span>《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。
番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。
当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。
至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。
第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。
第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。
最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。
以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。

                    <span>这是透视相机。 




 
这是笼中窥梦。 




 
这是正交相机。 




 
这是纪念碑谷。 




 
这是平面素材。 




 
这是画中世界。（其实是固定位置的透视相机！不是平面素材那么简单的！） 




 
你发现了吗？透视相机是近大远小的，离镜头比较近的地块要明显大一些。它和人眼在现实中的观察是一致的，所以在绝大多数3D游戏中，你都是用《笼中窥梦》的这种视角去观察周围的世界。 





对于《笼中窥梦》这种解谜游戏来说，选择透视相机和自由视角其实会让设计难度暴增。因为视角稍稍变动，物体的大小就会发生改变。想要找到一个适合做谜题的角度，需要精挑细选，反复琢磨。当然，这也给了谜题设计极大的自由度，能够容纳更有趣的点子。 



而正交相机就比较有意思了：无论物体距离距离有多远，在场景中的大小都能够保持一致。 
所以这种投影模式经常被用来做2.5D游戏，也会用来渲染一些2D场景，使其更有立体感。 



《纪念碑谷》也正是凭借着正交相机的这个特点，将原本分离的两个结构在视错觉下巧妙地组合到一起，进而构建出优秀的谜题： 





平面绘图的画中世界则更加直观。横版游戏都会这样把视角固定在水平面上，优秀的代表作品同样百花齐放： 




 
也同样复杂。 
即使视角固定，《画中世界》也充分利用了透视相机镜头拉远/推近带来的纵深感，设计出高难的谜题。不要真的以为是简单的平面素材啦！《笼中窥梦》的谜题设计思路和它是一脉相承的，也难怪《笼中窥梦》的设计师曾经向《画中世界》的设计师Jason Roberts请教谜题设计的方法。 
《画中世界》镜头推进

所以你会发现，《笼中窥梦》、《纪念碑谷》、《画中世界》虽然分别利用了不同的操纵视角与投影技术，却同样完成了“视觉欺骗”这一艺术效果，各自形成了各自的特色。 
《画中世界》有独特的视觉风格，有将两幅画叠加到一块来推进解谜这种平面艺术独有的思路；《纪念碑谷》依托正交相机，可以肆意改变场景的结构而不变形，为艾达公主用想象不到的方式开山搭桥；《笼中窥梦》解放了视角和操纵的限制，可以在游戏内容中塞入固定视角游戏难以承载的细节，在为谜题设计提供更多可能的同时，支撑起了一个元素众多，情节曲折的明暗线叙事。 




 
视错觉解密游戏为何如此令人着迷？我想，因为绝大部分的游戏也许都是对现实的模仿，但视错觉是对现实的超越。它创新，因为它挑战人的思维边界，因为它是属于电子游戏才能创造出来的独特乐趣。实话说，我很高兴能够看到，我们也能出现一个做出《笼中窥梦》的Optillusion工作室，能在Optical illusion（视觉欺骗）这个领域贡献一些独到精美的东西，和优秀的前辈作品们站在一起也不逊色。

                    <span>In this tutorial, you will learn how to work in a team with a central repository on GitHub. You will work on issues, commits, pull requests, code reviews, and more.
I don&#x27;t consider myself an expert on Git, but I have learned a lot about it in my first month working as a software developer. This tutorial is the result of my effort in telling you how Git is used in professional environments. Bear in mind that there is not just a single way of using Git, so this is just one approach, and it may differ from what you see in your professional career.
A good read to start working with Git workflows is the Comparing Workflows tutorial by Atlassian.

                    <span>The introduction of Infrastructure as Code or IaC has transformed the way you can provision and deploy high-performance cloud-based IT infrastructures.
IaC tools, such as Terraform, have been integrated into DevOps toolchains, saving DevOps IaC teams from the excessive manual effort.
While these tools undoubtedly help accelerate building IT infrastructures, their limitations can impact DevOps’ ability to optimize and improve control of their IaC processes supporting future business needs.

                    <span>Between meetings today, I learned about Django and continued my journey to a Javascript certificate from FreeCodeCamp.
I started today with working on FreeCodeCamp tutorials for about an hour. I then had to prepare for a couple meetings I had today. Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.
At the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.
I will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.
I also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week&#x27;s worth of changes. 
A little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I&#x27;m not too upset about it. 
A clean slate, a new approach!
I am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it&#x27;s really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. 
Complicated state management between components. I still haven&#x27;t quite nailed it down.

If we have a conditional statement, VS Code accurately evaluates the potential for us to hit the code outside of it:

bool could turn out to be false after all. But if we change the condition to true VS Code knows we will always run that block and (if there is an inevitable return inside) never reach the final line:

It&#x27;s almost as if VS Code has the ability to understand the semantics of code. But under the hood VS Code uses code to do this! How?

Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.

                    <span>日常生活中我们几乎每个人都会拥有大量网站帐号，时间久远了密码很容易忘记。因此，像 1Password 等密码管理 + 同步 + 一键登录的工具成为了很多人的首选。
然而 1Password 毕竟要付费，也有人会担心这类工具有隐私泄露的风险。其实，如果你有一台自己的 VPS 服务器，那么就能用开源的 Bitwarden 部署搭建一个私人专属的密码管理服务来代替 1Password！这样不仅免费，重要的是，所有的数据均保存在自己服务器上，更加放心……

序言
fish_redux 2.0 FlowAdapter 功能优化，整体业务落地后，我们着手fish_redux新一轮的优化与架构演进。fish_redux 3.x 版本最终的目标保持fish_redux的“生命力”，在框架的易用性，可扩展，核心能力部分做到可持续发展。本文分为三大主题，3.0版本首轮优化部分，架构的思考，后续fish_redux可持续输出部分。
​
fish_redux 3.0.1
关于涉及应用开发领域，相信绝大多数同学都听过或多或少了解MVC模型。MVC 是一个架构的描述，它有不少变种，如MVP， MVVM等，但本质上这些都属于MVC的范畴。MVC的定义或解释，不同的语言/领域/框架，又有不同的解释。MVC模式（Model–View–Controller）是软件工程[1]中的一种软件架构[2]模式，把软件系统分为三个基本部分：模型（Model）、视图（View）和控制器（Controller）。
当 视图（View）从传统的直接操作GUI对象 变为声明式UI/响应式UI。 会带来两个巨大的变化（MVVM变种）： 1）视图（View）层，对开发者，抹去了GUI的中间状态，复杂度进一步降低 2）MVC的之间的结构关系得到简化和解耦，模型（Model）和控制器（Controller）不再依赖视图（View）。
易用性和可维护性，往往是两个层面的考虑：
•易用性是对过往的归纳总结；•可维护性是对场景需求的进一步的抽象演绎；
​
那么以fish_redux为例：
•State定义 &amp; Reducer函数 对应 Model层•Effect函数对应Controller层•View函数对应View层
fish_redux3.0目的是解决由于客户端/前端应用层软件墒快速上升, 提升软件可维护性, 提高团队协作效率。 客户端/前端 应用层软件复杂度…</span>

                    <span>大力智能技术团队-客户端 都梁人
前言
本文旨在通过实际业务场景阐述如何使用Kotlin Flow解决Android开发中的痛点问题，进而研究如何优雅地使用Flow以及纠正部分典型的使用误区。有关Flow的介绍及其操作符用法可以参考：异步流 - Kotlin 语言中文站，本文不做赘述。基于LiveData+ViewModel的MVVM架构在某些场景下（以横竖屏为典型）存在局限性，本文会顺势介绍适合Android开发的基于Flow/Channel的MVI架构。
背景
大力智能客户端团队在平板端大力一起学App上深度适配了横竖屏场景，将原先基于Rxjava的MVP架构重构成基于LiveData+ViewModel+Kotlin协程的MVVM架构。随着业务场景的复杂度提升，LiveData作为数据的唯一载体似乎渐渐无法担此重任，其中一个痛点就是由于模糊了“状态”和“事件”的界限。LiveData的粘性机制会带来副作用，但这本身并不是LiveData的设计缺陷，而是对它的过度使用。
Kotlin Flow是基于kotlin协程的一套异步数据流框架，可以用于异步返回多个值。kotlin 1.4.0正式版发布时推出了StateFlow和SharedFlow，两者拥有Channel的很多特性，可以看作是将Flow推向台前，将Channel雪藏幕后的一手重要操作。对于新技术新框架，我们不会盲目接入，在经过调研试用一阶段后，发现Flow确实可以为业务开发止痛提效，下文分享这个探索的过程。
痛点一：蹩脚地处理ViewModel和View层通信
发现问题
当屏幕可旋转后，LiveData不好用了？
项目由MVP过渡到MVVM时，其中一个典型的重构手段就是将Presenter中的回调写法改写成在ViewModel中持有LiveData由View层订阅，比如以下场景：

前言
好的文档是代码编写成功的关键要素 —— 虽然在快速开发的当今，我们不爱写文档。但是实际上代码文档能够帮我们理顺思路，定义好输入输出参数，同时也能够帮助我们日后回顾代码，为团队其他人或是代码接手人提供第一手参考资料。比如，Flutter 的各个组件的注释就非常好，事实上，那些注释直接生成了 Flutter 的组件使用说明文档。
当然，也不能为了写文档而写文档，代码应该本身就是一个好的文档，我们应该只在需要的地方写文档，而不是随意地写一些没有意义的内容。本篇来介绍 Dart 官方推荐的代码文档编写规范。
注释
在 Dart 代码中，注释是指那些不需要包括在自动生成文档里的对代码的补充说明。
注释规范1：使用像句子那样的注释
使用句子能够保持注释意思的上下文的完整性，而像短语、缩写这类的注释可能每个人的理解都不同。
// 如果列表元素为空，则直接返回 false。
if (_itemList.isEmpty) return false;

注释规范2：不要使用块注释来当做文档
// 正确示例
void greet(String name) {
  // 假设我们有一个有效的名字。
  print(&#x27;Hi, $name&#x27;);
}

// 错误示例
void greet(String name) {
  /* 假设我们有一个有效的名字。 */
  print(&#x27;Hi, $name!&#x27;);
}

可以在一个代码块外面使用/* ... */块注释，但代码其他地方应该使用 // 注释。
文档注释
由于可以通过 dartdoc 解析文档注释并生成漂亮的文档页面，使得文档注释特别方便。
文档注释规范1：使用 /// 编写文档注释

🔥 介绍
本文通过OkHttp+Retrofit+Rxjava+Hilt实现一个网络请求框。
💥 最终代码
        iWanAndroidService.register(map)
                .compose(ResponseTransformer.obtain())
                .subscribe(registerData -&gt; {
                    //请求成功
                }, new ErrorConsumer() {
                    @Override
                    protected void error(ApiException e) {
                        //请求失败
                    }
                });

是不是特别省事。
💥 项目结构

🔥 OkHttp
💥 OkHttp是什么
OkHttp 是一个默认高效的 HTTP 客户端：
HTTP/2 支持允许对同一主机的所有请求共享一个 socket。
连接池减少了请求延迟（如果 HTTP/2 不可用）。
透明 GZIP 可缩小下载大小。
响应缓存完全避免网络重复请求。
网路出现问题后，OkHttp会保持不变，自动从问题中恢复。
官方文档
简单使用+源码解读
OkHttp的时候就不单独介绍了。
缺陷：
网络请求的接口配置繁琐，尤其是需要配置复杂请求body，请求头，参数的时候;
数据解析过程需要用户手动拿到responsbody…</span>

OCR pro 对标点符号的识别真的是差强人意，这其实恰恰是很多人标点符号使用上会出现的问题，所以才会有 pangu.js 的出现，pangu.js 的作用就是优化中英文排版问题，具体规范可见 中文文案排版指北，其中自然包括了中英文之间的空格问题和半角全角标点符号使用。
通过 pangu.js，我们很容易实现对摘录文本和标题的排版优化，我只做了很小的工作，相当于把 pangu.js 引入 Marginnote 中，基础代码修改自 Autotitile，感谢。
使用
本插件默认开启摘录优化，不支持关闭，我认为这是必不可少的过程。
提供按键开启点击卡片优化标题和摘录。但很遗憾，目前提供的 API 点击卡片后只能获取到卡片内第一个笔记以及标题，所以无法优化卡片内所有的摘录和评论，不过你可以点击文章中的摘录来触发。当然，从现在开始，你摘录的所有文字都将得到排版优化。

最后，提供一个批量制作选题题到anki的思路，就是在Mac上对选题的Word文档进行格式调整，在修改上快捷指令的基础上（比如删除开头有关Python脚本的引用，从获得粘贴板开始），就能实现Mac端复制，iPad端粘贴制卡，5秒就能搞定。
以上代码适合大多数题目的制作，总得门槛不算很高，对于快捷指令的修改，我在指令里有说明，我也是代码小白一名，希望能和大家一块交流学习，有兴趣的朋友可以尝试一下。</span>

                    <span>如果一件事物真的流行了起来，就不需要人为地制造「XX 元年」的概念，正如视频自媒体的兴起，以绝对的掌握力，统治了各类内容领域。我们买东西之前要看评测；买完要分享体验视频；旅游要发游记；生活内容要做成 Vlog。
世界被切割成几分钟到十几分钟的片段，代替了它本来的样子。
而从商业的角度来看，如果你错过了博客、微博、微信公众号的黄金时代，你绝对不想再错过短视频所带来的致富机会。即使「元宇宙」的概念已经出现，但它甚至还没到自己的「元年」呢。在肉眼可预见的几年内，视频依旧会是最主流的内容形式。
所以问题来了：

2021 年，该如何成为一名视频创作者？
在创作的过程中，有什么样的前人经验可以借鉴，又有什么样的难处需要面对呢？
在视频创作领域已经高度发展的 2021 年，你还应该成为一名全职视频创作者吗？

如果你对这些话题感兴趣，欢迎参加 11 月 19 日（本周五）20 点举办的「一派·在线沙龙」活动。

「一派·在线沙龙」是由少数派数字工具组策划，一次以语音为载体的科技爱好者聚会。每个人都有空间在这里表达自己的态度，倾听他人的思考。

                    <span>我玩动森已经一年多了，非常肝，目前进度是岛上环境已经达到了五星，博物馆的生物以及艺术品全部收集齐，更新前的大部分 DIY 手册和家具我都拥有了，目前游戏基本上处于一个磨磨蹭蹭岛建的阶段，每天上线 10 分钟左右做完日常任务就下线。虽然还在玩，但是总感觉缺少了最初玩的时候那种激动和新鲜，也缺少了动力。
很多次我都觉得这个游戏就是目前这样了，单机游戏能玩一年多，我已经很满足了。
所以当我看到动森更新的消息之后真的非常非常激动，甚至可以没有看 2.0 版本的更新日志，就直接上手玩了，又非常肝地玩了几天。我想，哪怕我不买 DLC，这个游戏我还能再玩个一年多。
更个性化的岛民服务
一开始就看到西施惠亲切地播报，说我的小岛可以由岛民代表（也就是我）去改变生活条例，这是一项影响岛的重大决策。改变生活条例属于和西施惠的谈话中「关于岛的方针」的内容，办理条例需要花费 20000 铃钱的协助金，一共包括四种条例，分别是优美岛条例、早鸟条例、夜猫条例、经济复苏条例。
西施惠介绍说夜猫条例是一项推迟商店结束营业的时间，熬夜并繁荣岛上夜生活的条例，我毫不犹豫就选了这条。因为我确实喜欢熬夜，而且我忙完可以玩动森的时间大多都超过了岛上商店和服装店的营业时间，无法买买卖商品和衣服。我的一位朋友逐渐淡坑的一个很重要的原因就是，等可以玩动森的时候都是深夜，商店也关门了，小动物也睡觉了，一个人孤零零的很无聊。夜猫条例就很便于我这种睡觉时间偏晚的人，也方便白天没有太多时间玩的社畜。
当然，如果你喜欢早起，可以选择早鸟条例。看到这一点的更新，我真的非常开心，也觉得非常温暖和治愈。这种更新考虑到了不同人的作息时间，可以让大家更自如地选择玩游戏的时间。
另外优美岛条例与岛的景观有关，经济复苏条例与交易有关。处于游戏其他阶段的朋友可以考虑。

除了西施惠那边的更新，我也和狸克聊了聊。狸克告诉我说房间收纳空间又可以扩容啦，…</span>

                    <span>随着可能是今年最后一场线上发布会的落幕，堪称 Apple 年度最重要的新品之一，传闻已久的 14 英寸和 16 英寸 MacBook Pro 终于在上个月与大家正式见面。
新款 MacBook Pro 是 5 年多来变化最大的一代：不仅有着全新的外观设计，M1 Pro / Max 芯片的加入也让预计为期 2 年的 Apple 芯片转移计划，在经过一半的这个时间点，实现了一大步跨越。里里外外全面焕新，也标志着 MacBook Pro 这款产品，开启了「下一个五年」的新世代。
虽然新款 MacBook Pro 的方方面面都带给了我们不少惊喜，比如更强得多的全新 M1 架构芯片、支持 ProMotion 自适应刷新率的 mini-LED 显示屏，以及终于拿掉了 Touch Bar、键程更长的内置妙控键盘等等。但我们也能看到许多妥协与遗憾，比如个人认为实在难以称得上好看、也不支持 Face ID 的「刘海屏」；当然还有无法让人忽视的尺寸与重量。
复古的外观设计，在「妥协」中找到「平衡」
在聊新款 MacBook Pro 全新外观设计之前，不妨先简单回顾一下这款产品的历史。
事实上，MacBook Pro 是一款 2006 年才首次推出的笔记本电脑产品，它的历史在 Mac 系列电脑中实际上相当短暂；在此之前，Apple 推出过 iBook、PowerBook、PowerBook G3 / G4 等多个系列的笔记本电脑产品，而第一台 Mac 电脑，则是 Apple 在 1984 年推出的台式电脑 Macintosh 128K。
第一台 Mac 电脑 Macintosh 128K。1997 年推出的 Macintosh PowerBook 2400c。2005 年推出的最后一款 PowerBook G4。

                    <span>做菜要用到的高温功能家电中，除了灶台、电磁炉等，烤箱现在也成了我家必不可少、几乎天天在使用的电器了，温度时间可调控、无油烟、是做烘焙的必需品，同时用烤箱来做菜的话，也兼有少油、省心、不易焦糊、不用频繁翻面的优势。不过和明火相比起来，烤箱菜的做法还是有些不同，也可以玩出更多花样，本篇文章列出了多道烤箱入门菜谱，蔬菜肉类甜品皆有涵盖，大概按照从易到难的顺序，不过总体来看都是比较简单的，希望对刚刚入手烤箱或是烤箱在家里搁置了很久也不知道怎么用的朋友们有所帮助。
在菜谱内容正式展开之前，先列出烤箱制作中需要常备的物件们：

一台烤箱；适配烤箱尺寸的烤盘、烤网；
可直接放置食物的耐高温烤碗（烤碗不可以直接放在发热管上！一定要垫在烤盘烤网上）；油刷；
烤纸（烤纸的作用是隔离开食物和碗盘起到不粘作用，否则像饼皮一类的在加热过程中会直接和碗底黏在一起，一抓就漏料。烤纸还能防脏，比如漏下去的蛋液在烤制时会在底部成焦疤状，有垫纸的话烤完直接把纸扔掉就行，否则刷渣子要刷好久）；
食品夹；
防烫手套。

另外一些关于烤箱的重点 tips：

每台烤箱的脾气都不太一样，有的温度会偏高或偏低，有的内壁炉温会高于靠近箱门的炉温所以可能会出现摆在里面的食物有点焦了摆靠外面的食物还没熟的情况，这些都需要大家在使用自家烤箱的过程中去熟悉，也建议大家把网上看到的菜谱中标示的温度和时间仅作为参考，根据实际情况进行调整。若还不清楚自家烤箱的温度情况，刚开始可以先在烤制中途蹲在旁边多盯盯，如果发现熟了甚至是有点焦了就提前取出，如果预设时间到了还没熟就再增加时长，或是备一根烤箱温度计。
烤箱使用前都需要预热，建议提前 5–10 分钟先将烤箱调至需要的温度打开进行加热，下文中提到的烤箱使用时长都是预热后、菜品需要在烤箱里呆的时间，不再另外做提示啦，预热很重要很重要很重要，尤其是烘焙来说直接决定了成败，新手们一定记得先预热…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

面对一篇微信公众号的文章，大家可能觉得没什么不寻常，但如果你有看到作者创作时使用的排版工具，便知道一篇文章排版工作的「不易」了。
比如说一篇文章的标题、引言、小标题、段落、引导等等，通常需要在浏览器插件、第三方浏览器等方式逐个插入模板来调整实现。虽然看似方便，但是日复一日重复这些操作，是十分枯燥无味的。
近期因为工作需要我捡起这活，在被「折磨」好一段时间后，发现真的做不来这种重复的工作，于是决定花时间解决它。当然我也并非标新立异，只是觉得一个内容工作者，应该把更多的时间留在内容上，重复的排版工作交给程序执行不是更香吗？
公众号排版样式的自动化
微信公众号的文章并非长篇大论，绝大多数也不是专业文献，所以它最常见的排版样式一般是一级标题、二级标题、正文、引用、图片、加粗等等。
这么一看，很容易联想到专门给写作者用排版语言：Markdown。它的好处是能让你通过键盘就能完成特定的格式排版工作，十分快捷高效。当然了，它也并非复杂的编程语言，可能你只需花 10 分钟就能轻松掌握。
比如说：写一级标题只需在文字前面加一个 # 号，引用段落样式只需在文字前加 &gt; 号，文字加粗则在文字两边分别加两个 * 号：
Markdown演示（少数派的读者都很熟悉了～）
如上图所示，通过 Markdown 写作，我们解决了内容排版样式自动化。但最重要的问题是：微信公众号编辑器不支持 Markdown，我们该如何同步自动化排版好的内容呢？

                    <span>在丹东抗美援朝纪念馆里，陈列着一件特殊的乐器——“两洲三国”胡琴。说是胡琴，但却无比简陋，仔细一看就会发现，琴桶是罐头盒，琴杆是一根木棍，类似绷带的布条将二者简单固定。

这把琴的介绍词是这样的：“在炮火纷飞的战场上，志愿军战士充分发扬革命乐观主义精神，在战斗间隙开展各种娱乐活动。激烈的战斗过后，志愿军战士利用缴获的美军罐头盒、朝鲜的木材和中国的马尾制作成这把胡琴。战士们给它起名叫‘两洲三国’胡琴。‘两洲’是亚洲和美洲，‘三国’是中国、朝鲜和美国。”
我难以想象，这是怎样一种精神，使得这把琴在炮火连天的战场上、在昏暗狭窄的坑道中发出悠扬的琴声。我不禁为志愿军战士革命乐观主义和革命浪漫主义精神所震撼。
而这，仅仅是中国人民志愿军宣传文化工作的一个剪影。
其实，残酷的战争与灿烂的文化并非“水火不容”。恰恰相反，越是激烈艰苦的战争环境，越需要丰富的文化生活鼓舞斗志。

入朝作战初期，由于志愿军防空力量较为薄弱，白天战士们只能躲在工事里，等待黑夜再进行战斗。在漫长的备战时间里，战士们充分发挥想象力和创造力，自娱自乐地开展了各具特色的文艺活动。如看到东北籍的战士唱起“二人转”，其他地方入伍的战士也争相哼起了自己家乡的小调。有的战士在行军中即兴作诗：“十一号汽车有力气，要带很多好东西，能爬山，能过河，一天要开几十里。”另外，前线的志愿军指战员们在战斗的间隙，以自己的亲身体验为基础创造了许多优秀的战地文艺作品，如歌曲《志愿军战歌》《来一个歼敌大竞赛》，说唱《侦察英雄韩启发》《阵地之家》，小说《突破临津江》等都是其中的代表。
这些志愿军战士自主创作的文艺作品，不仅形象地反映了运动战的特点，同时也洋溢着积极向上的革命乐观主义精神。
除了战士们的自娱自乐，志愿军还组织了专业的文艺演出队伍，爬山岭、进坑道，与志愿军基层指战员一起开展丰富多彩的文化活动

                    <span>Hello all, it&#x27;s been too long but this is the time to tell you about GreyOS!
GreyOS is an open source Meta-OS (nothing related to metaverse, facebook, etc.). I have been developing this since 2013.
GreyOS introduces the new computing era with the Cloud Computer (CC), which is always on, available, fast and secure.
Please check the details at https://github.com/g0d/GreyOS
I am looking for contributors, developers and testers to do so much more, create new integrated apps and reshape the computing landscape into something fresh!</span>

                    <span>Occasionally you might want to rename an AWS S3 bucket you are managing with Terraform. However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.
To avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.
In this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:
resource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {
    bucket &#x3D; “old-name”
}

and you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.
Firstly, we’ll need to create a new bucket. You can do this us…</span>

                    <span>Tailwind CSS comes with &quot;an opinionated set of base styles&quot; called Preflight. A helpful CSS reset built on top of modern-normalize.
Margins, headings, lists, and many others get stripped from their defaults. Thus, achieving cross-browser consistency and an easier adaptation of your design system.
It all sounds helpful, until you need those defaults to style a markdown post.
In comes @tailwindcss/typography, a plugin with sensible typographic styles. It adds a set of prose classes to style content blocks like the one you are reading.
You can install it via npm or yarn:
# Using npm
npm install @tailwindcss/typography

# Using Yarn
yarn add @tailwindcss/typography

Then add the plugin to your tailwind.config.js file:
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports &#x3D; {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require(&#x27;@tailwindcss/typography&#x27;),
    // ...
  ],
}

Finally, you can use the prose class to apply the markdown styling:

  
Welcome to Mars!
  
    Although life on Mars is perfect in every single way, you might have some questions.
  
  
    Of course there’s air! Just don’t breathe it. And, with the crazy gravity situation, everyone can dunk!
  
  


More information about the prose class and its modifiers can be found at the repository.</span>

                    <span>As Docker usage has grown, Docker Compose has become the leader in running multi-service applications locally. Unfortunately, as your application expands and more services must communicate, we’ve found authoring these Compose files can become arduous, time consuming, and mistake prone. We want to make writing Compose files with volumes, ports, and multiple services much easier. 
Today, we’d like to announce the Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code. That’s right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense, Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: 
IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image)

Right-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) 
YAML Syntax Validation 
Hyperlinks for Docker Images 
In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
There are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:
More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation 
… and much more! 
We love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.</span>

This article aims to help clear up a lot of the mystery around this topic with on caveat, the practices and standards can vary widely from workplace to workplace but this article should give you an idea of what to expect.

                    <span>At the beginning of November a client asked me to join their Cloud Panel and talk on the topic of cloud transformation. You can find the slides on Slideshare. 


 
This article is based on that presentation. So, let&#x27;s talk about cloud native development and its impact on organisations. Most of my clients are large insurance or financial companies. And the are considering a migration to the cloud. And they are asking for help. The discussions are either based on FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) or snake-oil.

It is not surprising that the truth lies in between.
This is the first of a two part series. Each introduces things we learnt while moving companies into the public cloud.  I focus on culture and organisation. Not because tech is boring. Rather most discussions focus on technology and …</span>

I&#x27;ve used this easy way for a horizontal scroll a lot and I want to share the code with you: ✌️
HTML

  

    

    

  


.horizonal-wrapper {
   height: 100vh;
   width: 100%;
   overflow-y: scroll;
}

.horizonal-content {
   width: max-content;
}

.content-1,
.content-2,
.content-3 {
  width: 50vw;
  height: 100vh;
  float: left;
  border: 1px solid;
}

JS
$(&#x27;.horizonal-wrapper&#x27;).on(&#x27;wheel&#x27;, function(e){

   e.preventDefault();
   $(this).scrollLeft($(this).scrollLeft() + e.originalEvent.deltaY);

});
