                    <span>First was the personal computer revolution, followed by the evolution of mobile computing. It&#x27;s predicted the next technological frontier could be an entire digital universe dubbed the metaverse. Powered by advanced computing and virtual reality, we could experience digital lives similar to video games inside the metaverse. This sounds far-fetched, so is it endless possibilities or all hype? Here are some ideas for how the metaverse could change the world and some ways that it could all be smoke and mirrors.
The term metaverse was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash. Since it has been depicted in other science fiction works like Ready Player One and The Matrix.
The metaverse is conceived as a digital world built on top of the internet. The idea is that pe…</span>

                    <span>Return? It never went away. Or at least that is what some smug &quot;told you so&quot; is going to say. But for those who haven&#x27;t been living under a rock for the past decade, for better or for worse much of the web has been moving to client-side navigation on their sites.
This movement has been fueled by the adoption of tools that support this sort of architecture. The &quot;modern&quot; JavaScript framework is designed to build applications. Single Page Applications. A name originated from the fact that it does not go back to a backend server to navigate between pages. All routing happens in the browser.
It started with web applications but React, Angular, Vue, and co.. have permeated every industry and every type of web experience imaginable from the grandiose scale of the most successful technology compan…</span>

Anycast allows you to have same IP address round to different node depend on geo location, This is the kind of guide I wish I know earlier. It’s very practical on how you can run that kind of network yourself, from registering ASN, acquire IP address, find BGP hosting… It can cost zero if you use IPV6 :).

                    <span>My friend Tom tweeted earlier which led me to this piece on trends in
CS professional development (PD). Tom&#x27;s tweet was talking about virtual vs
in person PD so I initially thought I&#x27;d write about that and PD in
general but the article actually led to some deeper issues with PD.
VAST majority of CS PD
is provided for by &quot;content providers&quot; - people with a product to
sell. That might be a curriculum, a technical platform, or both but
something to sell. It&#x27;s not just CS knowledge and how to teach
it. I include organizations like code.org in this bucket because while
they&#x27;re not selling in the same sense as a textbook publish, they are
selling or pitching their curriculum and platform.

                    <span>This is the blog helping myself to review the knowledge that I have went over. Hope you all enjoy my summary.
Before we dive into the deeper learning of computer system, the best way getting a comfortable start is to see the bigger picture of computer system structure. I think it is important for the beginner who just start learning Computer System or Operating System.
Just like a hamburger, which has different layers like piece of bread, vagetables, beef, cheese and so on, computer systems also are dive into different layers. 
Layers in hamburger:

Layers in Computer Systems: 

As we can see, computer systems could be divided into three big layers, which are: (Up to down)
All kinds of applications that we use daily
2.Operating System Layers
Operating System -- A special application between software and hardware, which is used to transfer user&#x27;s or applications&#x27; &quot;codes&quot; or &quot;instructions&quot; and then letting the hardware understand how to manipulate the menory.
3.Hardware Layers
Including CPU, disks, registers, RAM and so on.
Specially, and generally we can divede them into five main components (based on every single component could be dived deeper to study at the following chapters)
Input/Output ports. (I/O ports)


Central processing unit. (CPU)


Random access memory (RAM)


Secondary storage device (SSD)


Operating System (OS)






Next chapter, I will go over the , which is the basic knowledge in system, making you think like a computer. Hope you like it and subscribe it :)</span>

                    <span>🖤 Hi Programmers! 🐱
Today we will be walking through the third installment of the series on How To: Build A Linked List. Here are the links to the first two installments: 1 and 2. Please feel free to read those if you haven&#x27;t or reread to refresh your mind. 
We will be focusing on how to add insertion functionality via an insert() and traverse() method to our class LinkedList.
These two methods are definitely more challenging than the previous but together we are going to make them fully comprehensible and readable. 
Let&#x27;s get started!
1. Mapping Out insert()
2. Checking Parameters
3. Creating a New Node
4. Build traverse()
5. Traverse the Linked List
6. Recap + Summary



Our insert() method is going to have &#x27;index&#x27; and &#x27;value&#x27; parameters. We need both parameters, because unlike append(…</span>

                    <span>Python has been making the lives of developers easier around the world and its concise and clean form of code is the deciding factor that makes it one of the most admired programming language around the world.
It is shortened for Numeric Python. This library has various modules that can be applied on a single or perhaps different objects in our program. It helps us to work with multi-dimensional arrays and provides us complex mathematical functions that can make our work easier.
Whether it is working with matrices or doing high-level computations or even solving statistical problems, it is the go to library and if often used by data analysts. Operations like standard deviation, Correlation can be solved within milliseconds with the use of Numpy.

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, I will share my experience freelancing lately and share insights.
Let’s jump right in!
Freelancing is selling services at a fee to people who need those services. Say you are a plumber in a big city or town, you could market yourself as a plumber who is available on call to fix leaking faucets, etc.
The same goes for copywriting, Software development, Graphic design, UI/UX design. 
The hardest work in freelancing is combining:
Interpersonal skills
Business skills
Technical skills (expertise)
Interpersonal skills involve communicating with clients being empathic with their needs and finding a better way to solve these needs.
Business skills on the other hand involve running a business- Market, paying bills, saving some money, and keeping the business running.…</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t miss shaking hands. I think the first year of my career in DevRel I was sick after every single conference or meetup. In fact, I don&#x27;t think I could get through single trip for business or leisure without getting sick during or immediately after. 
Some of this probably had something to do with stress or being a contact lens wearer. I got Lasik in 2017 and stopped touching my eyes twice a day which I&#x27;m sure helped. Stress is probably unchanged.
I&#x27;m confident the majority of it had to do with planes, trains, automobiles, and shaking hands with literally hundreds of people. No conversation in my personal space started without a hand shake. 
Those were the days... filled with Con-flu &amp; PAX-pox.

                    <span>Introduction


Set objects are constructed using new Set().
A set is a “set of &quot; unique values. Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.
Sample code showing a simple Set object usage:
function main() {

    const gameScreen &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;game-screen&#x27;)
    gameScreen.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27; updateAction)

    const cursorPositions &#x3D; new Set()
    function updateAction(event) {
      let position &#x3D; {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}
      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case
    }
    // use unique cursorPositions below
}

while(true) {
  main()
}

Duplicate values are discarded when added to a set. This is useful for capturing and storing unique values where duplicate values are not needed.
const letters &#x3D; new Set()
letters.add(&#x27;A&#x27;)
letters.add(&#x27;B&#x27;)
letters.add(&#x27;A&#x27;) // duplicate entry is ignored
console.log(letters) // Set {2} {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;} 

The set object provides a way of storing data where duplicate values are not required.
Note: Most languages including JavaScript offer a lot of language features but it’s not a good approach to try learning all these language features at a go. However, knowing they exist is enough as it helps one know where to look when the need arises.</span>

                    <span>Introduction


In this blog article, we shall learn about map objects introduced in ES2015. Maps are key-value pairs, where the key can be of any type.
It&#x27;s a typical practice in JavaScript to use Object literals as maps, most likely because Object literal predated Maps.
Map objects can be created using the new Map() keyword.
Sample code showing how to create a map object and add some values using Map.set():
const studentDetails &#x3D; new Map()
studentDetails.set(&#x27;age&#x27;, 25)
studentDetails.set(&#x27;class&#x27;, 2018)
studentDetails.set(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;Naftali Murgor&#x27;)

In object literal, the following would have been equivalent of the above:
const studentDetails &#x3D; {
  age: 25, // made up
  class: 2018,
  name: &#x27;Naftali Murgor&#x27;,
}

Map offers useful helper methods compared to using object literal.

I’ve always loved to learn.  I want to know what makes the world work and why. There are so many interesting and beautiful things in our universe:  Music, Language, Mathematics, Spacetime.. And I&#x27;ve wanted to learn about all of them! Well, now I’m in my 30s and I can say that I have, in fact, learned about all of them. Well, not everything about all of them… but I have spent a considerable amount of time learning about each one, and most of what I know I have learned on my own. 
For the past year and a half, I have been dedicating my time to being a self-taught Software Engineer. I left my job as a high school computer science and mathematics teacher here in NYC to pursue a change and start a new career. After teaching people how to learn for many years, …</span>

The name of the project is LinkAnswers and it&#x27;s a different kind of Q&amp;A for developers:
Write the answers on your domain and then add a link to it.
Unlike traditional Q&amp;A, we give back to the contributors 🥰

Anyone can post a question, like a normal Q&amp;A, however you can write the answers on your domain and then add a link to it.
Basically it&#x27;s a Q&amp;A that wants to give something back to contributors.
Personally I am in the top 1% of StackOverflow and despite all the time spent on the site, I get basically nothing from there.
It would be nice to have at least some visitors and organic traffic to your website...

                    <span>So, approximately 3 years ago I posted my first entry which tackled the question of what should I go next on my web developer career. 
At the time, I had finished a mid-size project with my employer, with the opportunity to choose a tech stack, design and develop the architecture of the application. It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.
Anyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that&#x27;s the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.
Well then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for &quot;production&quot;). 
Hopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn. So now the next step is to take this experience and continue the journey. It&#x27;s still just the beginning.</span>

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are tokens that are unique and cannot be interchangeable. They are different from other tokens because they can represent unique assets or digital collectibles. Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
NFTs and Smart Contracts on the Blockchain
NFTs and smart contracts are two of the most important features of the blockchain. They are what make the blockchain a powerful tool for creating and managing digital assets. NFTs are stored on the blockchain in a decentralized manner, which means that they are not controlled by any single entity.

                    <span>Hi welcome to part 2 of the comprehensive guide to Svelte.
In this article, we will be learning how to fetch API data using Svelte. We will be using the GitHub API to fetch data about repositories.
First, we need to install the Svelte npm package.
$ npm install svelte
Next, we need to create a file called app.svelte.
&#x60;



GitHub Repository Data





const url &#x3D; &quot;https://api.github.com/repositories&quot;;
const request &#x3D; new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open(&quot;GET&quot;, url, true);
request.onload &#x3D; function() {
const data &#x3D; resp.body.data;
console.log(data);
}
};
request.send();
&#x60;
In the code, we first define the URL for the GitHub API. We then create a new XMLHttpRequest object. We open the GET request and set the URL. We also set the true parameter, which ensures that the request is made asynchronously.
We then define two functions, onload and onerror . onload will be executed when the request is loaded, while onerror will be executed if there is an error. We then send the request.
If the request is successful, we will get the response body. We will then extract the data from the body and log it to the console. 
You can try running the code in your browser. You should see the data for all the repositories on GitHub.

                    <span>Hi, this is Yaku and I just want to talk about Svelte.
Svelte is a new JavaScript framework that is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. 
Svelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. 
One of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. 
Svelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. 
Svelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient. If you are looking for a new JavaScript framework, Svelte is definitely worth considering.

                    <span>Java Semaphore简介
信号量（Semaphore）的概念是由荷兰计算机科学家艾兹赫尔·戴克斯特拉（Edsger W. Dijkstra）发明，较为广泛地应用于计算机操作系统进程通信，其核心原理是维护一个计数值，通过等待（wait）或者释放（release）操作来减少或者增加计数值。当计数值为零时，等待（wait）操作需要等到该计数值重新大于0时才能成功。

不同的编程语言一般都有Semaphore的实现，Java语言中Semaphore是concurrent包中提供的一个并发控制工具...</span>

                    <span>Meta 正在建造世界上最快的 AI 超算

Facebook 母公司 Meta 宣布 它正在建造世界上最快的 AI 超算 RSC。Meta 研究人员表示，新超算将能处理有数万亿参数的神经网络，相比之下 OpenAI 的自然语言处理神经网络 GPT-3 有 1750 亿个参数。新超算计划在今年年中完成建造，将使用 16000 个 GPU，储存容量达到 1 EB，能每秒处理 16 Tbps 的数据。


老王点评：这是为 Meta 宇宙准备的吧。




俄罗斯自研操作系统 Phantom OS 预计今年问世

俄罗斯花了 12 年研发的 Phantom OS 始于 2010 年，计划在今年推出原型操作系统，并创建基于 Genode 微内核的操作系统。其定位于 Linux 系统的竞争者，主打更好的性能，主要用于可穿戴及嵌入式设备。它有一个独特的“永不停机”的设计理念，可以将指定状态的快照存储到永久性存储设备中，一旦断电或者出现其他意外情况，系统可以回滚到最后一次状态并继续工作，好像一切都没发生过。


老王点评：所有宣称取代 Linux 的，最终都不了了之。




去年发生的数据泄漏事件远超历史记录

据一份 新发布的《2021 数据泄露报告》，在过去一年中共发生了 1862 起数据泄露事件，刷新了 2020 年（1108 起）和 2017 年（1506 起）的最高记录。报告还指出，涉及勒索软件的攻击在过去两年中每年都增加一倍，占 2021 年报告的网络攻击总数的 22%，按照这种增长速度，勒索软件攻击将超过网络钓鱼。


老王点评：勒索软件威胁已经成为了头号威胁，不过似乎国内企业对此的感受不深。</span>

                    <span>Google Chrome 无疑是 可用于 Linux 的最佳网页浏览器 之一。无论你在什么平台上使用它，它都提供了用户体验和功能集的良好融合。

另一方面，Brave 作为跨平台可用的、以隐私为中心的开源选项而广受欢迎。

那么，你应该选择哪一个作为首选网页浏览器呢？Chrome 适合你吗？谁应该使用 Brave？

在这里，我们比较了两种浏览器的所有重要方面（包括基准测试），以帮助你做出决定。

用户界面



Google Chrome 用户界面干净、开箱即用，没有不必要的干扰。

根据我的经验，默认情况下，它与 Linux 上的（GTK）系统主题融为一体。因此，根据你的自定义设置，它可能看起来有点不同。



如果你不在 Linux 上使用它，那么除了配色方案外，其他所有界面都基本相似。

而对于 Brave，它并不能开箱即用地适应你的系统配色方案。但是，你可以在它的外观设置里启用 GTK 主题。

Brave 与 Chrome 的用户界面接近，但有一些独有的调整/选项。



就用户界面而言，两者都不错，都很容易使用。

但是，Brave 提供了一些自定义外观的附加选项，例如删除选项卡搜索按钮（左侧到最小化按钮）、显示完整的 URL 等。



如果你觉得这对你有用，Brave 就更适合你。使用 Google Chrome，你在 UI 定制方面没有太多控制权。

开源与专有



Brave 是一个基于 Chromium 的开源网页浏览器。顺便说一句，我们还有一份 不基于 Chromium 的开源浏览器 的列表。

Google Chrome 也基于 Chromium，但它添加了几个专有元素，使其成为一个闭源产品。

虽然你可以期待 Brave 的开源和透明度带来的好处，但考虑到 Google 有专门的安全团队，他们在修补…</span>

                    <span>OpenBoard 是为中小学和大学定制的交互式开源白板。让我们来看看它提供了什么。




有几个可用于教育的开源工具，但是，并非所有这些面向中小学和大学的软件都能达到商业软件级的良好维护。

OpenBoard 就是这样一个不同凡响的自由开源工具，它可以不打折扣地为教育服务。它是一个交互式白板程序，具有所有基本功能，并支持各种硬件。

OpenBoard：自由及开源的交互式白板



作为一个自由开源的程序，OpenBoard 看起来是一个令人印象深刻的选择。

瑞士日内瓦州的教育部门（DIP）与 GitHub 上的社区一起维护该工具。

通过交互式白板促进简单的数字教学不应该花费很多，这就是 OpenBoard 的优势所在。

它提供的一系列功能对大多数中小学和大学来说应该是足够的。

虽然我无法在中小学/大学环境中测试它，但我会重点介绍它提供的主要功能。

OpenBoard 的特点



交互式白板没有众多花哨的功能，但足以使教师能够尽可能轻松地表达自己。

我注意到的一些特点包括：


跨平台支持

能够自由地写写画画

能够添加注释

能够删除注释

可以使用荧光笔高亮显示你的白板的部分区域

单独互动和移动创建/绘制的项目

按顺序添加多个页面，可以继续教学而不需要擦除

能够在页面间滚动浏览

绘制线条（从三种不同线宽中选择）

切换手写笔模式（如果你使用的是手写板或类似的东西）

轻松擦除在白板上创建的项目

可以从一组不同的背景中选择，包括把它变成黑板或带网格线的背景

各种必要的应用，包括计算器、地图、尺子等，都可以通过拖放使用

提供的一些形状，可以使绘图更容易

能够向你的白板添加音频/视频，并无缝播放，以获得更好的体验

虚拟激光笔

可放大和缩小

书写文字，调整大小，并克隆它

从白板中对屏幕进行截图

需要时可使用虚拟键盘


在我简短的测试中，用户界面和可用的选项工作得非常好，没有任何故障。



当然，你的体验将取决于设备的类型和你的设置。你可以用 Wacom 平板、双显示器设置，或者通过支持触摸的笔记本电脑使用投影仪来尝试。

在 Linux 中安装 OpenBoard

更好的是，它可以在多个平台上使用，包括 Windows、macOS 和 Linux。

如果你使用的是 Ubuntu，你可以到官方网站下载 DEB 文件。另外对于其他 Linux 发行版，你可以选择通过 Flathub 安装 Flatpak 软件包。


OpenBoard


结语

总的来说，我发现它在使用和导航方面毫不费力。你可以在多个页面之间快速切换，无缝擦除/添加项目，同时还可以在白板上添加丰富的元素。

通过虚拟激光笔以及一些应用，使得它适合在各种中小学和大学中使用而没有任何障碍。

我不知道它是否可以被称为谷歌课堂或 Miro 白板功能的替代品，但对于更简单的使用，OpenBoard 可以胜任。

如果你还没有试过，我建议你试一试。你知道有什么比这更好的东西吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。

                    <span>One of the primary functions of computers is to parse data. Some data is easier to parse than other data, and voice input continues to be a work in progress. There have been many improvements in the area in recent years, though, and one of them is in the form of DeepSpeech, a project by Mozilla, the foundation that maintains the Firefox web browser. DeepSpeech is a voice-to-text command and library, making it useful for users who need to transform voice input into text and developers who want to provide voice input for their applications.

                    <span>I like the Groovy programming language a lot. I like it because, in the end, I like Java, even though Java sometimes feels clumsy. And because I like Java so much, I don&#x27;t find many other JVM languages especially attractive. Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure, for example, don&#x27;t feel much like Java, pursuing their own perspectives on what makes a good programming language.

                    <span>huzhikuizainali: 是否有纯代码的机器学习书籍推荐？
目前在看的两本豆瓣高分书籍：
机器学习实战（原书第 2 版）
作者: [法] Aurélien Géron
副标题: 基于 Scikit-Learn 、Keras 和 TensorFlow
原作名: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems
ISBN: 9787111665977

Python 深度学习
作者: [美] 弗朗索瓦•肖莱
出版社: 人民邮电出版社
原作名: Deep Learning with Python
ISBN: 9787115488763
有几个痛点：
1 、一半讲机器学习，一半讲神经网络。而我目前想重点研究机器学习代码(需要结果可解释)
2 、每种机器学习方法还试图讲请背后的原理。但是推导过程详细程度又不如李航的《统计学习方法（第 2 版）》详实。属于学过的人能看懂。没学过的人看了直接劝退。关键是这些内容占用了大量篇幅。
3 、代码过于简单且代码中没有注释。关键函数没有详细说明。给没学过的人讲相关库的函数。总要把这个函数的功能，使用方法，输入值返回值讲清楚吧。但是那两本书中只给出代码片段，并没有对相关主要函数使用方法进行详细说明！所以我看完以后还是一脸懵！
综上，是否有偏代码实现的机器学习高分书籍推荐？针对那些已经学过机器学习原理，重点关注如何用 python 上的三方库(最好是主流的库)实现机器学习。代码的讲解越详细越好！包括主要函数的用法，最好还能配套一些机器学习方面的编程技巧。</span>

因此可否用逆向思维，给广大科技博主投稿。说新机外形继续沿用上一代，万年 Lightning ，Face ID 和大刘海，再拿个老款的机模拍张模糊的照片，说是公司内部偷拍的。苹果没准真的会去抓内鬼，然后 USB-C 的 iPhone 原型机成功转正。</span>

这是某行业排名第二的公司，干出来的事儿：
入职体检承诺报销，无；
承诺的团建经费，一年仍未报销；
年前年后不允许请假，特殊情况请假只能使用年假；
优秀员工挂钩晋升与加薪，全部内定；
员工司龄不超过 18 个月没有年终奖；
承诺的定期调薪窗口、以及年终奖浮动几乎没有（参考 4 、5 条）；
人事部门一问三不知，什么规定都不敢在大群发布，只敢偷偷逐级传递号令，一问就说不知情；
打车报销不能超过 25 元（起步价就十几块了）；
任何外出活动工作属地需要报备审批；
不支持购买任何商业开发软件，抓到记大过。

1 月 25 日下午消息，中国电信今日举行 5G 消息商用发布会，正式宣布 5G 消息进入商用阶段。
2020 年 4 月，中国移动、中国电信、中国联通联合发布《 5G 消息白皮书》，阐述了 5G 消息的核心理念，明确了相关业务功能及技术需求，提出了对 5G 消息生态建设的若干构想。
时隔近两年后，5G 消息终于迎来了正式商用。
5G 消息分为个人 5G 消息和行业 5G 消息两类。对于个人而言，基于手机号码，无需下载，提供统一入口；对于企业来说，可以降低企业获客成本，服务更加全面。
张小军表示，面向个人，中国电信提供 5G 消息标准套餐，探索多种计费模式；同时扩大 5G 消息终端覆盖范围，加强行业合作。
在具体的资费方面，个人接收免费，发送与现行短信一致；企业按照不同消息类型分别收费。

                    <span>ecnelises: 
看到这个隔壁帖子（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/830515 ）有感。async/await 的基本逻辑是这样：
async myFunction() {
  // some code
  await readSomething() // 执行至此处函数交出控制权，读取完成后回到此处继续执行
  // some code
  await sendRequest() // 再次交出控制权
}

和这个模型最为贴近的是协程（生成器），await 相当于一次 yield ，然后等待外面 call 自己的作为调度器的某个东西再 resume 进来。Swift 5.5 加入了 async/await ，把这个调度器做到了系统的事件循环里，所以（起初）需要新系统支持。
然后查了一下 TypeScript 和 Rust 的实现，都是基于状态机，原理其实和 Swift 的类似。但换种方向直观理解，async/await 好像也可以改写成嵌套回调，比如：
// some code
readSomething(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // some code
  sendRequest(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    // some code
  })
})

因为有闭包，所以循环也可以通过改成尾递归再写成这种格式。了解了下这种格式有个学名叫 Continuous-passing style ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style )，看起来也很合理。但为什么很多编程语言都选择了另一种实现方式呢？</span>

两个问题
问题 1:
2021GDP 为 1143670 （亿元），2020 为 1013567 （亿元）；
(G2021-G2020)/G2020&#x3D;12.836%,
为何统计局说增长 8.1% [比上年同期增长（%）] 
数据来源 国家统计局： http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/zxfb/202201/t20220118_1826497.html
*GDP2020 的数字出炉也挺有意思，2021/01/18 公布的数字是 1015986 亿元，http://www.gov.cn/zhuanti/2020zgjjnb/index.htm 各大媒体都报道逆增长，但是过了将近 1 整年（ 2021/12/17 ）这个数字被修订为 1013567 亿元，
然后过了一个月公布 2021 年的数据。难道知道 2020 年数据有误经过了 1 年的纠结时间吗。现在好多三方统计都没有修订这个数据。
问题 2:用电量能更好的体现经济晴雨表
全社会用电量（ TEC ）
2021TEC 全社会用电量 83128 （亿千瓦时），2020TEC 全社会用电量 75110 （亿千瓦时）；
官方口径同比增长 10.3% [我用（ TEC2021-TEC2020 ）/TEC2020&#x3D;10.67%]
那么：中国的用电增速与 GDP 增速统计上没有看到关系，2011 年每千瓦时电创造 10.4RMB  GDP/千瓦时，现在快速提到了 13.76RMB  GDP/千瓦时;
这十年的单位价值分别是（ RMB GDP/千瓦时）
13.7579395630834
13.4944348289176
13.6532447581482
13.4301611418721
13.1907969624427
12.6084512990304
12.4118594594595
11.651786069922
11.1411081675216
10.8604383859975
10.3976346743948
难道中国在提高效能方面有了突破天际的突破？
数据来源 国家能源局 http://www.nea.gov.cn/2022-01/17/c_1310427282.htm 
查询美国能源署 https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/ 数据一目了然；

如题，一直以来挂的个人博客，服务器用的国外的云服务，位置在洛杉矶，然后域名解析交给 cloudflare ，被打了就开防护，一直以来都是这么操作的。
近期（大概有一个多月时间了吧），有朋友反馈登录不上去，我试了试用国内其他朋友的代理，都能连上，只有他这个电信用户连不上。
用他电脑的远程桌面试了一下，ping 网址是能解析到 cf 的 cdn 地址的，说明 dns 大概是工作正确的，服务器那边也没问题，因为其他人都能正常访问。但是网页就是单纯的无法打开，打开的反馈与断网非常一致。应该也不是系统设置的原因，因为情况是突然发生未变更过什么设置，而且其他所有网站访问也都正常，单独说这个博客的话，普通状态打不开，如果开个代理的话就又能连了。。</span>

指的是从小程序那套独立出来的云函数、云存储，提供前端 sdk 直接调用。
从阿里云官网没找到，只有 serverless ，跟腾讯云的云开发还是有区别的。我从 dcloud 上看到他们基于阿里云封装了云函数等，提到阿里云这个能力还在内测中？从 dcloud 用也不知道靠谱不？
接的单，客户要求必须用阿里云。

前年给长辈买了一台红米 NotePro 系列，今年卡得要死，遂刚换了一台荣耀 30X 。
我拿到新机，设置一会都要吐了，无论是第三方 APP 还是系统本身，都争先恐后争抢屏幕这块弹丸之地，都在极力地推销自己，导致系统很多地方都有诱导点击的按钮，就是为了让用户去订阅 /开通一些服务。甚至在系统设置里面都能有广告。我个人是从 5s 的年代用 iPhone 到现在，之前用的是三星 s4 ，那时手机系统就是单纯手机系统，哪有那么多五花八门乱七八糟的东西。
所以我的感觉就是 这些原厂定制的手机系统根本不是为了用户能有更好的体验，而是为了用户能不放下手机。
对比 ios 至少能让我觉得手机还是干净的，还是为我服务的。

                    <span>haimianbihdata: 本人广东双非学校。22 届。今年大四了。
工作方向是大数据开发。数仓开发这些的

有一个份实习。3 个月。公司规模 500 人左右，工资 6k 。也是做数据开发相关的。
不过工作内容，就是做边缘活。搭环境。偶尔爬虫。偶尔配报表。

技术栈：java 学到了 springboot 。会自己独立做一个 web 。Python 会爬虫。docker 会。还有就是那些大数据的组件。hadoop hive flume kafka 这些。

目前离职在家。在跟着尚硅谷做数仓 5.0 的项目。。进度大概在 40%。因为觉得在学校做的项目，太垃圾了。都不好意思写在简历上了，所以做了一个。数仓项目，跟着尚硅谷做。

我的疑问点：很怕，做完这个项目。简历上面试官觉得对视频做的。不会感兴趣。直接 pass 。

第二点。因为那会实习。秋招没投。自己也清楚自己水平，大厂无缘。目前是找一个 500-1000 人的公司。或者 1000 以上的公司就好了。过完年。大概 2 月底出来继续找工作。因为没有毕业证。还要继续投实习吗？牛客上面的那些校招公司。每一间都是大厂。感觉没有一家是自己可以投的。校招流程也很久。这个时间点，有点不知道要干嘛了。

第三点。之前没有专研过算法。力扣也没有刷起来，我想在回顾一下 java 基础。hadoop hive kafka 这些组件的知识。还是说。我直接去做算法题，复习网络。操作系统这些知识好呢。那个在校招更加重要呢</span>

                    <span>ChrisFreeMan: 我不想花时间写的多好看，我只想记住我现在的感受。
在结束了毫无意义又刻意忙碌的一天后，如同往常一样，我按时出去夜跑了。在这个南方的小城里的冬天是又湿又冷，每次出去夜跑都需要很大的勇气。但是前几天接连不断的雨天中断了我的日常锻炼习惯养成计划，让我再无借口不踏出这一步。
下楼的那一刻天空中似乎还飘着细微的雨丝飘在我的脸上，连续几天闷在家里真是憋得慌。我开始脑袋放空，全身放松，甩动着双臂并迈开腿朝着附近的公园跑去。这一刻似乎是我最放松的一刻，将我从永无止境吸走我的人生的显示器前解放出来，让我开始天马行空的思考着各种各样的事情，想着过去，想着最近，想着未来。在我跑了一圈又一圈后，身体似乎被运动唤醒了，在刚开始的寒冷僵硬在运动后全身暖和舒服了起来，我深吸一口气，感觉异常的清爽。脑袋在这一刻也变得无比的清醒。自我，似乎在这一刻又觉醒了。是啊，好多次了，以前小的时候睡前盯着熄灯后月光映射下天花板的时候，在快要进入大学幻想着未来，晚上睡不着的时候，在工作第一个月半夜醒来的时候。自我似乎一直在缠绕着我。这个时候的我开始思考着一切，身边的时间似乎满了下来，与此同时，结束夜跑后，我开始往回漫步。
车流从我身旁划过带起了一阵阵微风，拂动着我的脸。我侧眼一瞥，看着路上骑着电动车结束一天忙碌的大人，又或者是刚结束一天的学业奋力踏着自行车想要早点回家的学生，我想着这些人有像我一样在此刻清醒的感受这个世界吗，这个世界上除了我之外，其他人有有像我一样思考“我”吗？他们是真实存在的吗，除了我之外的一切都是真实存在的吗，除了我个人感官的感受，我又如何证明这一切都是真实的。这种突然醒来的“我”存在的意义是什么，或者它有意义吗？到底它想提醒我什么？“我”是谁？为什么“我”会是我，为什么现在感受到的“我”似乎没有青少年时候的“我”更加清晰了，它似乎在淡去。当我依然刻骨铭心清晰的记得那时候的感受。
“我”在永远消失之前，它会带我走向何方。

纯属胡说八道，大家看一乐呵</span>

最近几天发现通过百度搜 ip 看自己公网 ip 的时候，如果是 219 开头的话，ping 日本节点才 60ms ，并且下行速度满速。
有时候路由器会自动重新拨号，会自动变成 119 开头 ip ，同一个节点延迟会变成 160 多，并且 youtube 播放只有几兆。
然后我打电话给电信就说网速慢，然后和维修的师傅说我的 ip 显示和我的地址不匹配，后来他在后台不知道做了什么又回到 219 开头了，用了几天后路由器又重新拨号了，结果又变成 119 开头，我早上接到一个师傅的电话说居然说帮我弄了个公网 ip(其实他是和第一个师傅工作交接没做好以为没弄好，干脆给我弄个公网 ip)，现在又变慢了超级难受。
现在不知道怎么选，如果你们也是广州电信的话可以试试重新拨号，或者给他打电话让他给你分配个 219 开头的 ip 试试看</span>

IT 之家 1 月 24 日消息，今日有开发者放出了微软电脑管家 1.0 的安装包，宣称是微软官方自主研发的全新桌面安全辅助类产品，只针对国内用户测试，使用了 Windows 官方 Defender 病毒库，功能比较简单，但也给人一种十分清爽的感觉。
从下载地址域名和用户协议内容来看，这款软件确实与微软（中国）以及世纪互联（大概率由国内团队开发）有关，但 IT 之家并未在微软官网找到任何痕迹。
据介绍，微软电脑管家聚合微软 Windows 系统强大的底层研发能力，搭配微软独有反病毒引擎，全面构建您的电脑防护体系。微软电脑管家主打低占用，不打扰，干净，不捆绑的产品特点，为用户提供电脑体检，反病毒，主页反劫持，电脑垃圾清理等功能。
...
可以说本地化很到位了，不光是需求，界面都是地气满满，这东西界面不像是 2022 年的微软视觉标准，估计是哪个厂外包的东西。有一部分用户真是可怜呢。</span>

今天领导找谈话了，只有 0.5 个月，问了其他公司，也有一个月
大概也知道为啥，和领导正面吵了几次架，不爱加班，不爱和同事交流方案（感觉自己都可以搞定），代码倒是没出什么事故。
部门属于加班比较多的，今天效益也不好，亏钱。我不爱加班，尽量都是到点走，6 点半下班，同事都卷到 7 ，8 ，9 点，有时候 11 ，12 点，无加班费，只有个便宜晚餐。
和领导大吵了几次，一次是周六叫我去加班，说线上刚上线一个竞猜游戏亏损了（亏一万多骗我说亏了十几万，实际是游戏的正常波动），让我来加班，结果我来了各种改给我的需求，改完发现一个边界结果，再改，如此反复了几次，我就态度很差了。一次是问我某个东西上线没，我说没给我需求，就这个吵了一会，最后领导歇火。
没有 1 个月我是有预期的，明年也打算跑路，只是没想到只有 0.5 ，大概对我要离职也是心照不宣，目前也不给我分配什么重要的任务了。
公司的绩效也很不透明，不知道标准和后果是啥。
本来 7 ，8 月就想跑的，后面还是忍耐了，果然发现公司不对就应该早点跑。
真是令人不爽啊。</span>

「快手饭」烹饪指南：即使熟悉的白米饭，也能做出新鲜感

🔋 充电量：125
作者：毛仔

人类种植稻米的历史起源于中国。大米作为市面上最常见也最为人所熟知的主食，经过数以千年记的发展、改良和创新，已经成为全球产量第二的食物。中国自古就有「鱼米之乡」等词汇，充分体现了大米对于中国百姓生活的影响。而法国名厨乔治斯·奥古斯特·艾斯可菲（1848–1935）也曾感叹：「米饭是世界上最好、最营养的——而且毫无疑问，它也是最普遍的主食。」由此不难看出，无论对于东方还是西方人，米饭都有着独特而浓厚的吸引力。
那么，作为一种看似平凡却又历史悠久的食物，我们又有哪些方法可以在家庭餐桌上折腾出新花样呢？今天本文就列举一些好吃又好看的碳水大餐！
阅读全文&gt;

编辑荐语（张奕源 Nick）：制作这篇内容期间，我派商城刚好上架了一款袁隆平大米，于是我便想到借此机会约作者制作一篇详谈大米烹饪的文章，最终就有了这篇米饭制作指南。
在打开文章之前，不少读者都以为文章只是单纯地讲怎么蒸大米的，实则不然。文中详细列举了大米的各种吃法，如煮粥、盖饭、包饭、炒饭等，每种做法都非常详尽，附有精美的配图。不仅如此，作者毛仔还充分考虑到了当代都市青年们没时间下厨的现实情…</span>

2022 年明星歌单推荐
王嘉尔：创作和收获

🎧 点击收听
2021 年对于王嘉尔来说是收获的一年，音乐创作中他和 Karencici、ICE、J.Sheon 组成 PANTHEPARK，并发行了首张专辑《The Park》，融合了嘻哈、电子等多种新潮的音乐元素，向外呈现出 C-Pop 新貌与文化自信的统一。
也正是这种积极的心境，王嘉尔在为我们挑选的音乐中首先选择了自己的《LMLY》开场，而之后则是多首 PANTHEPARK 和自己参与的作品。除此之外你还可以听到 Clairo、GRACET 和 Chelsea Cutler 这些乐坛新声，也可以听到 Kacey Musgraves 和 Donovan Woods 这些实力创作者的优秀作品，在王嘉尔的选择中，调和成一道别具滋味的 Pop 盛宴。
 
郎朗和吉娜·爱丽丝：音乐和家庭的多重收获

作为一对钢琴眷侣，郎朗和吉娜·爱丽丝的 2021 年依旧围绕着音乐，郎朗完成了此前因为各种原因没有完成的演出，而吉娜·爱丽丝则推出了自己的独奏专辑，最重要的是，两人的爱情结晶也在这一年来到世间，为他们带来了初为父母的喜悦。
因此你可以在他们两人的歌单中感受到多重收获带来的喜悦，作为古典音乐爱好者的你依旧可以听到那百听不厌的《春节序曲》《彩云追月》以及《欢乐的牧童》，也可以听到一些私货：比如吉娜自己新专辑中两人一起制作的《匈牙利舞曲》，当然你还是可以听到古典经典名曲——想必两位钢琴家推荐自然是不容错过。当然除了古典之外，也…</span>

                    <span>在经历一个多月的反复调整，解决了一系列重大 bug 后，One UI 4 正式版终于在十二月底重新开启推送，并在几天之内赶上了之前的预估进度。
目前 S21 系列、Note 20 系列与 Z 系列第三代新品已经可以体验到新系统的完全体了，除了系统版本升级为 Android 12，One UI 4 还带来了大大小小接近 80 项功能更新。在这篇文章中，我将选取其中较为重要的变化，赶在 S22 系列到来之前，简单介绍一下 One UI 4 带来的新气象。
本文基于 Z Flip3 与国行 S21 写作，实际体验在不同机型可能有差异，以实际功能更新为准。

紧跟 Material You，但还是星味满满
One UI 的设计风格一向非常具有辨识度，经典的方圆形（Squircle）图标让人一看便知。但同时，它也能紧跟 Google 提出的各种新设计标准，比如 One UI 3 中引入的 Android 11 毛玻璃效果。本次 Android 12 在 Pixel 设备中引入的 Material You 主题取色系统也同样被 One UI 4 成功化用。

One UI 4 内置了一个名为「调色板」的功能，在设置壁纸之后会跳出提示，以自动取色的形式设置系统主题色。

经过测试，你目前可以在电话、计算器、联系人、设置、时钟、提醒、我的文件、信息和智能管理器内观察到全局颜色调整带来的改变。但由于目前 One UI 并未采用原生 Android 12 以色块为主的设计，因此自动取色最直观的结果只呈现在系统设置内的开关与系统应用在默认启动器内的图标颜色上，以及通知栏快捷开关的按钮、锁屏与 AOD 的时钟字体颜色——但是后面这些选项即使在前几个版本的 One UI 中也均可以通过系统设置手动调整，因此目前 One UI 4 所呈现的效果更像是主题颜色「自动化」。Pixel Launcher 中…</span>

上海又撞上疫情，连续三年春节不能回家，对父母始终有些亏欠。
昨天（春节前 10 天），收到微信的提示，提示使用定制红包封面。
突然发觉这是个好主意。不能回家，那帮父母做个红包封面。自己似乎也随着红包，跟父母一起给亲戚拜年。

红包封面的设计并不复杂，小白也能轻松设计。不过前提是，要有个 100 粉丝的视频号或公众号。
接下来介绍下，微信红包定制的整体流程。
红包封面额度
微信发了 2000 个红包封面，足够我帮家里每个人定制红包的。
值得注意的是，封面会在 2022 年 2 月 1 日 23:59 过期，只能在大年初二前使用。
微信红包团队的生意算盘太响了。这活动，不但给红包封面带来大量新用户，后期也能让不少人续费红包时间。

没用获取红包封面额度也没关系，可以自行购买。封面费用是 1 元/个，购买 n 个则 n 个用户可以使用此款红包封面，有效期半年。
封面平台注册
领取定制红包额度后，提示登录到 微信红包封面开放平台。
首次使用封面平台，需要注册并认证。如果你是用个人身份认证，注册中无付费环节。

个人认证，需要100粉丝的视频号或公众号。

注意，绑定的个人微信号需要实名认证。
红包封面设计
注册成功后，即可定制红包封面。
微信提供了 psd 和 sketch 的红包封面模板，流程参考 微信红包封面官方文档。
不懂设计模板能不能用？
可以的。
零基础用小画家，有图层概念则用 Figma。
不管工具如何，你上传图片，即可完成红包设计。
示例基础图片 (推荐手写字体：杨任东竹石体)
封面注意事项

红包封面会展示公众号名称和头像。名称一年可修改两次，头像一个月可申请修改 5 次。因为红包是给家人用的，不方便展示公众号信息。我选了个不用的公众号，把名称和头像都修改了。
红包审核需要 3 个工作日，距离春节也已经很近了。如果你想在春节使用定制红包，尽快申请审核三个红包封面，避免最后关头未通过。
如果微信红包封面中出现肖像，需要授权。拜年红包还是希望有全家福，我提交了资料，但通过几率不大。

完成后的红包：

                    <span>先说结论：
目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。


正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。
事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。
无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。
针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。
他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。
这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。
除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 
简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。


但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。
所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。
但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。
SAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: 

当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。
因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。
驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…
而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…
双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。

                    <span>本文首发腾讯视频NBA公众号。

      连续七个主场的赛程，对于全联盟主场战绩第一的勇士队来说并不轻松。首个主场比赛日他们就爆冷输给了缺少四大主力的步行者队，随后面对西部倒数第一的火箭队，他们也只是靠着库里职业生涯的第一个压哨绝杀才赢下比赛。





今天的犹他爵士队，过去的八场比赛输掉了六场，没有戈贝尔的时候他们遭遇了四连败。戈贝尔回来后，米切尔又因为对阵湖人队时脑震荡开始休战。本赛季有米切尔的时候爵士队每百回合得118.3分，能排在联盟第一，没有米切尔的时候爵士队每百回合只拿到109.7分，是联盟第十九的水平。坐镇主场迎战缺少了头号得分手的爵士队，勇士队还是赢面很大的。





果不其然，勇士队在大多数时间保持着比分上的领先，第四节爵士队的反扑非常凶猛，可勇士队还是靠着最后4分钟防的爵士队只进了一个三分，赢得了比赛的胜利。全联盟防守效率第一的勇士队靠着出色的防守，将对手命中率压制到38.3%赢球，听起来合情合理。可勇士队球迷怎么还是面带愁容呢？


现在的库里，生涯最铁


和爵士的整场比赛，库里一直没找到他的投篮准心，20投5中，在三分线外13投1中。上一场打火箭尽管有着最后的绝杀，可其实库里也只有21投6中。连续两场比赛命中率都不足30%，这种事儿居然发生在库里身上，怎么可能呢？



 其实就在本月初，连续对阵热火和独行侠的比赛中，库里就交出了17投3中，24投5中，合计41投8中的表现。两场球下来命中率不足20%，创下了他自己连续两场的最低命中率记录。





 美国媒体statmuse做了项库里的投篮数据统计：职业生涯库里单场20次出手以上，命中率最低的7场比赛，有6场都发生在本赛季。去年12月，库里的三分命中率只有37.4%，但是今年1月，库里的三分命中率已经跌破30%大关（117投35中，命中率29.9%）。

                    <span>将汽车轮胎按照地区分类，大致可以分为欧洲、北美、日韩、东南亚、中国。轮胎和所在地汽车工业息息相关，甚至间接决定了品牌定位。
典型如韩国，韩国汽车产品定位亲民家用，韩泰、锦湖也比较注重这方面。日本和美国是汽车老牌大国，两国汽车市场高度捆绑，所以两国轮胎品牌也主要以经济和越野为主。中国和东南亚地区的轮胎品牌，也都根据当地的汽车企业定位，诞生了比如玛吉斯、佳通、朝阳、玲珑等主要轮胎品牌。
欧洲有些不同的是，作为汽车的发源地，大量的运动赛事和跑车、豪华、家用、经济型汽车的全方位涉足，使得欧洲诞生了诸多性能顶级、品类全面的轮胎品牌，包括大家耳熟能详的德国马牌、米其林和倍耐力等。


选择合适的轮胎前，先搞清楚需求。
大多数轮胎品牌都有从上到下全面的布局，有经济、豪华、舒适、性能等各个系列，所以如果不是完全家用、经济趋向的车型，售价在15万以上，对操控、静音有些要求时就可以重点考虑欧洲品牌了。
问题是，一款轮胎不可能方方面面做到尽善尽美，如果有，那就是方方面面都不是最好。
如果在意成本，应该侧重考虑耐磨，但是耐磨一定程度上会影响舒适性和操控性，噪音也会增加。对于一些非入门车型来说有些得不偿失。出租车一般会倾向选择耐磨轮胎。
如果在意性能，比如领克03+、高尔夫GTI、宝马240i这一类的车子，需要重点考虑抓地力。抓地力好的轮胎可以有效提升车辆极限，相应的耐磨会变差。如果为了迁就耐磨，整车性能得不到发挥，事实上会造成更大的浪费。


如果是商务出行，比如别克GL8、奔驰V一类的车型，需要重点考虑舒适性。
如果是新能源车型或者豪华轿车，由于先天出色的静谧性或者对静谧性的高要求，应该侧重静谧性选择轮胎，以获得更加安静的乘坐感受。
有了需求就可以按图索骥选择产品了。多数汽车品牌有明确的系列划分，要理解一点都不困难，比如德国马牌旗下一共有三个大类：全能、运动和越野，命名规则是Conti-XXXX…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
笔者其实不太敢为陈朵作人物传记，因为陈朵的故事并不像一人之下作品中的其他人，可以作为普罗大众眼中比照自身的参考，她不同于张楚岚、诸葛青、王也这些普通人。
她是一个真正的“异人”，一个震撼人心的“人”。

陈朵的一生充满了各种崎岖坎坷，悲剧贯穿了她短暂的一生，但同时陈朵的人生又出离于普通人的生活，不论是作为她自己抑或是作为旁观者的我们都很难把陈朵归类普通人，她确实和这个世界格格不入，她是个“异类”。
只是她很幸运，能够在一群好人的守护下，幸运的活成我们看到的样子。
她也是个倒霉的孩子，无数次的机会她也可以不走向这样的结局。
但是陈朵的故事已经结束了，笔者觉得应该为她著书立说，盖棺定论。同时发生在她身上的诸多违和之处，也需要放在显微镜下仔细剖析。
最初她来到这个世界，是因为不得不来；最终她离开这个世界，是因为不得不走。——余华《活着》
起点：生而“异人”

如果说要在陈朵的悲剧里面找一个绝对的反派，那就一定是药仙会。
这个苗疆的会道门不愧是彻头彻尾的邪教组织。他们掳掠了各方面都极优秀的49个婴儿，从婴儿时期便以蛊毒喂食，在内脏种植蛊毒，还要抹除包括天性和人性在内的一切性情，最终用养蛊的方式让这49个孩子在自身蛊毒的厮杀间一一被淘汰，而最后唯一幸存者便是他们制造的所谓“蛊身圣童”。陈朵的这段过去正是她悲剧的起点，是至死都无法抹去的猩红底色。
2010年药仙会终于覆灭了，陈朵被公司“解救”出来，送入暗堡救治“改造”。
肉体的囚牢易解，心灵的枷锁难开。

药仙会的实验无疑是极为成功的，因为蛊身圣童完美的符合了他们设计实验之初的每一个要求，一个无视世间一切，只会制造蛊毒和接受指令的“工具”。
是的，工具，药仙会并不需要蛊童具有人的一切性情属性，甚至只需要开发出能够执行蛊身之术的理解力就够了。

就像那位血腥的资本家亨利福特的名言：“我需要的是一双手，为什么上帝给了我整个人”。…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
人物志系列停更许久，笔者本想先把陈朵人物志写完，但是思来想去，这个人物实在太火了，还是不凑那个热闹吧。
回望作品，笔者发现王也这个角色总能让人感触颇深，米二也愿意为他花费笔墨描绘他的人生轨迹，细腻之处甚至让笔者怀疑，王也就是米二理想中的自己。
他就像你我身边的一个朋友，在面上活得潇洒，混不吝，遇事有能量，有手段，年纪轻轻便走到了物质和精神两个层面的高峰。在骨子里他也温润如玉，豁达自在，哪怕怀璧其罪没有惶恐不安，哪怕力有未逮也始终放不下天下苍生， @天师道的白山正 说他和周圣合称”内圣外王“，这个”王“便是王也所行的王道。而在笔者看来，王也这个人物不仅仅是有其崇高的一面，他也有凡俗人的一面，相比“藏巧于贱”的张楚岚和“飞蛾扑火”的诸葛青，他向往逍遥世间的偷闲，也更是不愿沾染这世间的因果。
在笔者看来，王也其人，配得上”无为而无不为“一语。

生于安乐窝
王也作为中海集团老板王卫国的三公子，他的身家算得上出道即巅峰，投的一手好胎。
父亲的生意家大业大，父母还非常恩爱，生了三个儿子不够（王亦、王又、王也，瞧瞧这名字起的，啧啧啧），还想继续生闺女，甚至还有能助兴的蓝色小药丸，不得不说也总有一个幸福的原生家庭。

王卫国原型
此处有个小细节，王也的父亲叫做王卫国，出身行伍，上过边境，在部队里面也曾是吆五喝六的人物，其原型则是真实世界的两位牛人的混合体。
一位是王校长他爸，16岁就参军，17岁就到吉林省集安县的鸭绿江边成为了一名侦察兵，25岁就晋升排长进陆军学院进修，35岁则转业下海，62岁时登顶华人首富。这份经历和王卫国的人设不能说完全一致，只能说一毛一样。

另一位原型人物则是“玉帝专业户”，国家一级演员·真·王卫国。
先后在《西游记续集》、《宝莲灯》及《宝莲灯续集》中，饰演玉皇大帝一角，因此被广大观众熟知。有趣的是，正是因为王卫国扮演玉皇大帝的形象让人过目难忘，在以后的…</span>

                    <span>这题我熟。
还剩不到一周就过年了，虽然现在过春节不如小时候热闹，但心里总归还是有点小激动的（毕竟有假放）。
如果没有疫情，全家一起出门玩儿已经成为一部分人过年的方式。
我挺推荐过年去北京的，原因嘛自然是因为北京的年味儿浓，那些红墙已经把气氛拉满，再配上大街小巷里各种灯笼和糖葫芦，不用放刘德华的《恭喜发财》过年的感觉就出来了。


而且北方冬天有雪有冰，可以看冰灯会、玩滑雪、泡温泉，还有新年集市可以逛，能把新年过得很有实感。


今年年初四是冬奥会开幕式，不知道防疫政策会不会因此变得更加严格。不管如何还是想分享一下北京过年攻略，万一用得上呢。我估计原地过年的人也不在少数，这下正好可以好好感受京味儿十足的过年气氛。



去永宁古城赶个大集
永宁古城位于延庆，距市区大约2小时车程。它不是那种商业化的景点，里面的老建筑都是货真价实的，据说从唐代开始就有这座城了。



永宁古城之所以出名，也是因为这里每天都会有集市。平时的周末节假日就有不少特地来赶集的人，过年期间当然会更热闹一些。
集市和商店主要分布在主街上，卖啥的都有，爆米花、糖画、糖葫芦……集中看到这些东西，年味儿直接就扑到面前了。



淘货也赶集的乐趣之一，虽然主街不长，但各色摊位密集，从吃的到用的统统可以买到，价格也都不贵，正好可以采办些年货。周末的上午是最热闹的，建议大家安排好时间去玩。




对了，别忘了顺路吃古城最有名的小吃：火勺和豆腐。火勺有点像烧饼，但是会带一点椒盐味，中间夹肘子肉很好吃；永宁豆腐是用酸浆点的，加上这里水好，做出来的豆腐滑嫩又鲜美。



过年前后北京城的庙会和市集应该还挺多的，各位北京土著如果知道类似的集市欢迎留言安利。



去景区热闹过节
每年新年北京的几个景区都会有固定的活动，大家凑在一起热热闹闹地过节也不错，很适合带家人或是小朋友一起去玩。

                    <span>何为黑色电影之黑
法国影评人定义了黑色电影，他们从四十年代美国电影中归纳出这种风格。到五十年代末，奥逊·威尔斯执导的[历劫佳人]宣告了经典黑色电影时期的终结，随之而来的是所谓的新黑色电影——彩色取代黑白、黑色元素和主题融入某个类型化叙事中——犯罪、惊悚、科幻、恐怖等。黑色电影概念包含了一系列视觉和影像风格以及特定的主题——犯罪和荒诞。所谓黑色，既强调视觉，也强调叙事和主题。

从社会性源起来说，黑色电影是对二三十年代约翰·福特、弗兰克·卡普拉等导演所信奉的美国中产社会价值的反叛。底层、中产阶级、警察、女人等，或是陷入腐化堕落的罪恶环境，或是走向犯罪深渊。黑色电影虽然鲜少直接谈论宏大的政治、社会问题，但它们或多或少从这些问题中，产生了创作的冲动和灵感。源自人性的贪婪和腐败是导致主角犯罪或堕落的根本原因。
回看美国经典黑色电影，“黑色”之意并不难领略。它们大多是讲犯罪故事，或是与人性的阴暗面有关，让人感到既危险又迷人。主角只是普通人，而非穷凶极恶的帮派人物，或是被逼无奈的反抗者。
一般来说，1941年的[马耳他之鹰]在好莱坞刮起了黑色电影之风。从类型上来看，它是一部侦探电影，但具备了与该类型电影不同的黑色主题——不是聚焦于一般意义上的犯罪或悬疑解密，而是透过侦探之手，发现罪恶背后，道德和人性的失衡。

当侦探、女主和犯罪团伙的老大围在传说中用金子制作的马耳他之鹰周围时，他们的目光聚集了贪欲，但影片在此又狠狠黑色了一把：众人搭上几条性命，互相欺骗和斗争而争夺回来的宝物，却是一文不值的东西。
这种历经千帆后，被宿命击中的荒诞，亦是黑色电影迷人的地方。与女主暧昧的侦探，最终向警察告发了她的罪行。这是早期黑色电影的“保守”之处(因为海斯法典，好莱坞当时对性、变态、犯罪、暴力的表现还有很多禁忌)，摇摆的道德最后要回到正轨，作恶者自食其果。

You may have already noticed that we obsess over user experience in places where humans meet APIs. And we like to simplify things, a lot.

Pointer cursors were invented to indicate links on the Web. It is tempting to adopt them for all active elements in apps that use web technologies, like we initially did. However, after a thorough research, we decided to say goodbye to pointer cursors.
Speaking of design: we—and our beta users—didn’t like the default title bar in the desktop app. It wasted space and didn’t fit our custom design – the entire window should blend in with the app’s personality. And now, starting with macOS, it does:

                    <span>Like most fast-growing companies, LinearB spends WAY too much time trying to hire developers.
So when we came across a brilliant article about hiring autistic talent, we knew we had to have its author Matt Nigh on the podcast. Matt is one of the most prominent thought leaders on neurodiversity in the workplace.
Matt himself was diagnosed with autism late in life following a very unique job interview at Google. He’s since spent countless hours researching, writing and talking about how companies can not only bring neurodiverse talent into the fold, but why engineering teams thrive when they do.
In this episode of Dev Interrupted we talk with Matt about best practices in recruiting, hiring and working with neurodiverse coders, how his interview at Google interview led to an autism diagnosis, the ways Matt’s data team at the University of Washington is helping combat COVID and what private companies can learn from the ROI metrics of universities and public institutions.
Dan and Matt also took some time to geek out about GitLab.
We hope this conversation was as enlightening for you as it was for us and we hope it helps you find your next great hire.

                    <span>The Basics


Ethereum is a network of computers which collectively form the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which updates the state of the Ethereum blockchain. A blockchain is a publicly available and distributed database, which acts as the memory of the EVM. One role of this memory is acting as a ledger, saying who owns how much Ether, the cryptocurrency supported by the Ethereum network. The computers participating in this network are called “nodes” or “miners”, and the computational power they contribute is what keeps the EVM running. For their work, they are rewarded with Ether, hence the term “miners”. The EVM can also run programs called “smart contracts”, which are programs stored on the blockchain and run on the EVM.

It&#x27;s the same for your brain. If you are learning a new framework, a new programming language, or working on a side project to expand your skills, you are much better off doing a small amount every day, or several times a week, as opposed to bingeing. When I hear a friend say something like &quot;I&#x27;m dedicating this coming weekend to learning React&quot; I cringe because I fear they will go back to their day job and forget everything from the weekend by the next weekend. 
But don&#x27;t take my word for it. The science backs this up.

If you frequent DEV Community or have ordered from our shop, you have likely seen me around. I originally joined the DEV Team in June of 2019 as a Business Development and Growth Intern. Although I had been an intern for some time, my colleagues have always respected me as a significant part of the team through-and-through. 
Two-and-a-half years later, I graduated from The College of New Jersey with my Bachelor&#x27;s in English. Now, I&#x27;m becoming a part of the DEV Team full-time as a Developer Marketing Associate! It&#x27;s a really exciting change and I&#x27;m looking forward to every part of it. 
Between work and school, I have not had a lot of time to improve my programming skills and engage with the community on a personal level. I hope to change this over the course of the next few months. I&#x27;m certain you will all be seeing more of me as I tackle this new position. Wish me luck!
If you have any questions or comments — or just want to chat — don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out! Shoot me an email or a DM on the DEV Community Discord (Where I&#x27;ll be waaaaay quicker to respond to you. Join if you haven&#x27;t yet!).</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve worked in a scrum team for a while, and later I saw other developer teams working in an old school way. Here are things I&#x27;ve noticed.
senior developers aren&#x27;t approachable, working in silos. Many cases don&#x27;t show up for weeks. 


junior devs onboarding lasts feom 6 months to a year, and after that still have gaps in knowledge about product.


developers chase each other on chat for bugs introduced. Changes therfore reverted including improvements.


Developers work on ad-hoc tasks, interrupted by client support with nonsense issues.


client support has no understanding of iasues and can&#x27;t replicate it befoee pasaing on to devs.


clients calling developers on the phone.


dev team manager coding


no version control. Backups restored, changes lost, task solved become unresolved.


tickets contain multiple tasks, often left halfway done and closed.


templates arent updated as per latest data changes, old code commented out, duplicate codes.


developers aren&#x27;t aware what the rest of the team is working on. 



I&#x27;m not saying this is bad, it&#x27;s not wfficient. Junior take a long time to -if ever- understand the whole project and their skills remain unexploited. Validity of development can only be seen when task is completed, so if it&#x27;s worthless, then all the time and work went down the toilet. The product isn&#x27;t evolving, only the codebase becomes larger.</span>

                    <span>User Interface or UI for short and User experience UX for short.User Interface is the part the user sees or interacts with often called frontend.It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use node or python as backend language.The only thing users cares about is how your website feels ,they describe it by looking at and using your website.
Best Practices for Designing an Interface
1.Keep the interface simple
2.Create consistency and use common UI elements
3.Be purposeful in page layout
4.Strategically use color and texture
5.Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity
6.Make sure that the system communicates what&#x27;s happening
7.Think about the defaults.
8.Think like an user:

Sadece kendisi üzerinden localhost(127.0.0.1) üzerinden 5432 portundan haberleşebilmektedir. Bunu tüm ağlar üzerinden veya spesifik ağlar üzerinden erişilecek şekilde açabilirsiniz. 
Uzaktan bağlantıya izin verilmesi için, /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf dosyası içinde aşağıdaki satır düzenlenmesi gerekiyor: (normalde başında diyez var içinde de localhost yazıyor)
listen_addresses &#x3D; &#x27;*&#x27;

Uzaktan bağlantı sağlayacak IP adresi veya IP adreslerinin bulunduğu ağ için /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf dosyasının en alt satırlarında bir yere aşağıdaki satır eklenmeli.

Bu satır eklendiğinde tüm ağlardan erişim sağlanabileceği gibi, güvenlik olarak sadece istenilen IP adresi veya ağ adresi yazılması daha uygun olacaktır.

                    <span>Hi! Been a minute, but I&#x27;m back with another CSS tutorial!
This one will be pretty quick, but should give you a great launch point for extrapolating and creating something special.
Now you probably know that you can add borders to specific sides of an element, using, for instance:
.border-top {
    border-top: 1px solid white;
}

Result:

But what you may not realize, is what happens when you add a very simple additional property: border-radius! Now, maybe this sounds super obvious, but just how cool it is, isn&#x27;t obvious until you see it in action, so let&#x27;s do that:
.border-top-round {
    border-radius: 50%;
    border-top: 1px solid white;
}

Result:

Cool, isn&#x27;t it? No?
Well let&#x27;s make it so!
If the first bit wasn&#x27;t all that impressive, maybe adding a little fun and flare should do the trick.
Check it out!




So what&#x27;s the code for this one? Grab it here (it&#x27;s free!):

                    <span>Getting the security right in applications is tricky. Most developers did not undergo professional security training and are not adept in such topics. At least I know I&#x27;m not.
Luckily, multiple tools can help us achieve a relatively good security posture. Snyk, CodeQL and GitGuardian are good examples.
In some cases, even a deployment framework can be helpful. This blog post will expand on this topic, looking at how a particular feature of AWS CDK can help us enforce compliance of various resources we deploy to AWS.
Enter AWS CDK Aspects.

                    <span>“Introverts don’t shout at the world, they listen!”
The day I learned the word “introvert”, I finally understood myself completely. I had spent my entire day reading, researching, and taking every test on introversion. Finally, I understood why I don&#x27;t fit in with most of my friends, why I enjoy my own company most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with me. 
I grew up in a &quot;culture of personality&quot; where everything is designed to cater to extroverts. For example, we were always encouraged and rewarded for working together, speaking up, or asking questions in schools. Likewise, we were promoted and rewarded for marketing ourselves with outgoing personalities at workplaces. Sometimes, we had to pretend to be extroverts in order to fit into the system.

                    <span>Introduction 😊


Today we are diving into a particularly interesting program. We will be discussing link preview.
For long ago I&#x27;ve been noticing on some social media and apps a small preview of what awaits us in case we click or decide to follow the link, and others not having anything to preview. This has caused a set of variations on the different aspects of this link preview. Without turning around the boring story, let&#x27;s go through our program.
Whenever on social media you add a URL, or when you receive an email message with a URL in the body, you&#x27;ll see a rich preview that includes a link title, thumbnail image, domain, and description of the link. This is called a link preview. 
Below is a clear example of such.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever used conditionals in your code you&#x27;ve seen if statements, and if you&#x27;ve seen if statements you&#x27;ve seen them nested several layers deep. In your personal project this could be simply annoying and cause problems down the road but in production code this can be really problematic. 
    The ternary operator, ?:, is one Question Mark operator and a feature in some programming languages that makes conditional statemnts cleanier and easier to read. The basic syntax goes like this:
condition ? if true : else;

In use this would look like this:
const foo &#x3D; true ? 1 : 0;

In this snippet, foo is 1, since the condition is true, and true is (obviously) a truthy value.
If you&#x27;re not sure what truthy/falsy values are just think of it this way:

                    <span>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about putting my static sites on servers
that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub
Pages.
Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of
maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind
of maintainance their servers require, and
they convinced me that it might not be that bad.
So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see
what it was like.
Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did
anyway because there are a surprising number of decisions and I like to see
what choices other people make.
the constraint: only static sites
To keep things simple, I decided that this server would only run nginx and
only serv…</span>

                    <span>以后可以在 Linux 应用中看到（很多）广告了

Qt 宣布支持客户端应用程序中的广告，应用程序开发人员现在可以在桌面应用程序中提供 广告服务，而这通常是 Windows 用户的待遇。Qt 被广泛使用在桌面应用程序开发中，KDE 就是基于 Qt 框架开发的。虽然估计不会在 KDE 的核心应用程序中看到广告，但有可能一些急于挣钱的发行版会将这些应用程序分叉，在其中放置广告。根据其文档，该广告插件支持所有主流平台，包括 Windows 和 Linux 等等。


老王点评：这个消息让我一时不知道该怎么说，一方面确实可以补贴一些开源开发团队，另外一方面充斥着广告的 Linux ，怎么都感觉不对劲。




自毁代码库的作者要求恢复其发布到 NPM 的能力

Faker.js 的原作者在 自毁 了其两个重要的开源代码库之后，GitHub 和 NPM 一度封禁了他的账户并回滚了其提交的恶意版本。之后 GitHub 恢复了他的账户，而一些社区贡献者 复刻 了他的 Faker.js 项目，并提出了积极的发展路线图。而该作者在 Twitter 上 抱怨称，GitHub 取消了他向 NPM 发布和修复错误的能力，一直没有恢复。他称其还有一百多个包要维护，并委婉地承认了错误：“每个人都会时不时地犯编程错误。没有人是完美的。”


老王点评：公平的讲，虽然该作者的行为不合情理，但是 GitHub 和 NPM 也没有强行封禁的权利和理由。




Linux 供应商固件服务考虑为老旧设备提供开源固件

开发者提议，由 Linux 供应商固件服务（LVFS）这样的实体为已经过了保修期的硬件提供自由开源的固件。这涉及到一些法律问题，而且这样的举动可能不会得到硬件供应商的认可。到目前为止，由于法律要求、良好的安全模式等原因，LVFS 完全依赖于 ODM/OEM 为其硬件上传固件。对于没有经验的用户来说，通常不是很容易自己操作闪存。而采用 LVFS 可以使你更容易地关闭系统的专有固件，并在支持的情况下切换到自由固件。如果用户接受采用第三方固件的风险，这样也为挽救过保的硬件提供了可能。


老王点评：我觉得这是一种有益的尝试。</span>

                    <span>Linux 有助于弥合数字鸿沟，延长硬件的使用寿命，使得它成为操作系统的一个环保选择。




与大流行病作斗争，造成了生产新电脑所需的微芯片的短缺。此外，一些较新的专有操作系统提高了它们的硬件标准（LCTT 译注：Windows 11，别扭头看别人）。这个难题为我们这些在日常生活中使用 Linux 的人创造了一个机会。

延长硬件的生命周期

长期以来，Linux 一直以延长老旧硬件的寿命而闻名。这种能力对那些每天使用电脑的人来说是个福音。

在过去的一年里，我已经帮助许多人使用 Linux 翻新和 改装旧电脑。基于 Linux 的电脑耗电更少，启动速度更快。Gnome 桌面很好，但许多旧电脑更适合 LXDE 或 XFCE 环境，它们运行需要较少的资源。

像 FreeGeek 和 Kramden Institute 这样的组织已经把弥合数字鸿沟作为他们的核心使命，并以此为目标。这些团体对旧电脑进行了再利用，使它们不被当成垃圾填埋，而是把它们送到需要它们的用户手中。没有 Linux，就没有这些项目。

DD-Wrt、OpenWrt 和 Tomato 都是 Linux 解决方案，使旧的网络硬件不被当成垃圾丢弃，并同时为用户的路由器提供更多的安全、隐私和性能。

借助 GalliumOS 和 Mrchromebox.tech，即使是 Chromebooks 在谷歌停止支持后也能获得新的生命。

新的机会

Linux 创造了一些本来不存在的机会。学生和业余爱好者都在没有投资的情况下开始了计算机科学的成功事业，这要归功于他们在旧电脑上学到的经验。这些系统运行企业级软件，如 LAMP 栈，它促进了向 “Web 2.0” 的过渡。它是最早的 Web 开源软件栈之一。今天，它为 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla 系统提供了动力。事实上，Linux 为超过 96% 的世界前 100 万台 Web 服务器提供动力。Linux 还管理着 嵌入式系统、电子阅读器、智能电视、智能手表 等等。Linux 是世界上远远 超过 70% 的智能手机的操作系统。甚至美国国家航空航天局（NASA）今年在火星上创造历史的 毅力号，也是由 Linux 驱动的。

为当今大多数应用提供动力的云计算，没有 Linux 就不可能存在。今天的大多数 Web 和智能手机应用都在基于 Linux 的 容器 中运行。即使在微芯片短缺和专有系统成本高昂的情况下，进入云服务行业的人也有机会学习开源的操作系统和软件。

未来

但最恰当的是，Linux 和开源为 联合国可持续发展目标 提供了动力。随着大流行的继续，Linux 仍然是一个重要的资源。

                    <span>CrowdSec 门卫被设计成可以包含在任何 PHP 应用程序中，以帮助阻止攻击者。




PHP 是 Web 上广泛使用的一种编程语言，据估计有近 80% 的网站使用它。我在 CrowdSec 的团队决定，我们需要为服务器管理员提供一个 PHP 门卫，以帮助抵御那些可能试图与 PHP 文件互动的机器人和不良分子。

CrowdSec 门卫可以在应用栈的各个层面上进行设置：Web 服务器、防火墙、CDN 等等。本文关注的是另外一个层次：直接在应用层面设置补救措施。

由于各种原因，直接在应用程序中进行补救是有帮助的：


它为潜在的安全威胁提供了业务逻辑上的答案。

它提供了关于如何应对安全问题的自由。


虽然 CrowdSec 已经发布了一个 WordPress 门卫，但这个 PHP 库被设计成可以包含在任何 PHP 应用中（例如 Drupal）。该门卫有助于阻止攻击者，用验证码挑战他们，让人类通过，同时阻止机器人。

先决条件

本教程假定你在 Linux 服务器上运行 Drupal，并使用 Apache 作为 Web 服务器。

第一步是在你的服务器上 安装 CrowdSec。你可以用 官方安装脚本 来完成。如果你使用的是 Fedora、CentOS 或类似系统，请下载 RPM 版本：

$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.rpm.sh


在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上，下载 DEB 版本：

$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.deb.sh


这些脚本很简单，…</span>

                    <span>为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。
我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。
为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。
短信转发至 iPhone 效果
在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App
🔗 下载地址：App Store
Bark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 &gt; Bark 服务端 &gt; 苹果 APNs 服务器 &gt; 你的设备 &gt; Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。
第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。
Bark App
在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder
🔗 下载地址：酷安
SmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。
打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。
将Bark设置为发送通道
返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。
设置短信转发规则
除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。
为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️
出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。
示例：realme UI 后台权限设置
出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。
realme UI 验证码安全保护
将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac
根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。
总结
得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。
如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。

                    <span>写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢 「用产品思维解构生活」 的花生酱，也可以叫我 Jeff。
我至今正式写作了6年，看上去是蛮不错的坚持成果，但老实说，最近1年我才开始喜欢自己的文章，也是在最近1年，我才找到自己“高效产出文章”的效率写作之道。
效率写作是个复杂的旅途，途中险象环生。
缺乏灵感和选题会让我们放弃，自说自话会让我们找不到读者，拾人牙慧会让我们迷失自我。这些复杂的难题，每一个都足够成为效率杀手，吞没我们的写作生涯。我也是花了5年时间，才逐一和解，摸索到我今日能安于写作的状态。
所以，我试图用这篇文章探讨：谈及写作，我们如何从入门、坚持再到高效。
希望诸君无需5年弯路，都能找到自己的效率写作之道。
 
粗放写作的利与弊
20221月我的少数派数据
2016年的我，从未想过自己能有幸发表文章被几万人阅读。
彼时，我带着不屑与傲慢开始写作，尝试去解答一些诸如“产品经理能力模型”的宏大命题。结果是，我被社区拒稿了4次，进而，巨大的恐慌和质疑包围着我。当时被拒绝的原因诸如：1.文章结构不符合金字塔思维；2.内容不够深度...
但我都不能完全地理解、修正，甚至自己完全看不出问题。
这种不理解，进一步引发了自我怀疑。
每天我都在想，我是不是不适合写作，我写的东西是不是太啰嗦了，或许我当前的能力不足以写产品话题，我该沉淀两年再等等？但对于这些问题，我并没有能力第一时间找到答案---否则就不会被拒绝4次了。
总之，我带着诸多疑问和拙劣的技巧，在自尊心的驱使和责任编辑的指引下，开始不断修改。第5次能够成功，其实并不是改得多好，而是靠坚持不懈。被拒绝带来的挫败和质疑激发了我的斗志，完全出于“洗脱被拒绝现状”的自尊心，让我坚持改稿。或许是不小心改到了要求的水准，或许是这种坚持一定程度上感动了编辑，历时2个月，终于发布。
就这样，这种“出于自尊心”的坚持，在头两年成为了我写作的源动力，甚至是唯一…</span>

那我应该将 Token 存在哪里比较合适。
如果每次调用函数都去申请一次 Token 也不合理。保存在数据库好像也太麻烦。</span>

不知道是两个手机里有什么程序，会时不时开启大量的连接？不知道 OpenWrt 有没有为单个设备限制连接数的方法，自己百度和 Google 都没找到。之前用光猫拨号的时候没遇到过这种情况，连接数也从来没这么高，很稳定。师傅说开了桥接速度跑不满，并且要改回光猫拨号就得花钱换光猫。

双 e5-2650 和 3950x ，其他配置一样，3950x 稍微贵一点
想问下是不是 3950x 性能好一些，大概好多少呢？

Windows 版微信收藏中，网址会经常莫名其妙的翻倍，今天复现了一下，步骤如下：
收藏-&gt;新建笔记。
空白笔记中，插入数字编码。
在数字1.后面输入一个网址，如www.v2ex.com。
按回车，会自动出现2.。
保存，关闭该笔记。
再打开该笔记，bug 出现了。你会发现第一条的网址前面多了个HYPERLINK。
在第二条中随便输入一些内容，保存，退出。
更神奇的 bug 出现了，你会发现第一条的内容自动复制了一份。
重复步骤 7 、8 ，第一条中的网址会一直翻倍。
注：
Windows 版本微信，版本号：3.5.0.46 ，当前时间（ 2022 年 1 月 24 日）的最新版。
因为手头没有 Mac ，所以 Mac 版本不知道是否有此问题。
单纯好奇，微信为啥会做的这么烂？</span>

晚上打开 VSCode 的时候，感觉有点怪怪的，仔细一看，这个 Terminal 的背景色怎么有点格格不入。
正常状态下，这个背景色应该是融入进去的啊。

顺手打开 insider 版本确认一下，insider 版本是好的：

切换某些配置会短暂恢复正常，录屏演示一下，好像不方便嵌入，传到 telegraph 了
https://telegra.ph/file/47e95e0214d8b8c537913.mp4
一开始以为是自己无意间改了什么配置，把看得到的全都修改了一遍，后面甚至彻底删掉全部的配置，连同步的配置和插件都清空了，就差砸电脑了。  
最后突然想起来，该不会是 VSCode 自己的问题吧，去官网下载了一个 1.62.3 版本，问题消失。

                    <span>tracker647: 背景是在小区居家十四天隔离，家门口被装了监控，丢垃圾和取快递都没法自己完成。
垃圾还好有好心的邻居出门时帮忙顺路丢，但是没保安的联系方式，唯一有联系方式的是定期来给自己测体温的一个大叔，令人恼火的是这人十分冷漠，只管测温，下丢垃圾上送快递的顺路事完全不理。
还好同城有亲人给自己送补给，不然就得住隔离区了。
想想就算有保安的联系方式他也不一定给我把快递捎上来，毕竟是陌生人，总麻烦也不太好，而且不太符合自立更生的原则。
于是脑洞就来了，我想要是未来再次遇到类似的情形, 更好的办法就是自己足以有钱到买个能提重物的无人机，自己把快递带上来。如果有幸再住在有阳台的居室。

为了防止无端 ky ，先说明小区情况：住 9 楼，有阳台，住宿楼入口有垃圾桶，小区不大，大概 4 个足球场大, 出门口就能看到保安室，保安室紧挨着快递屋，没用丰巢所以不用担心滞留问题。</span>

具体就是在拼多多上面发现了 type-c 转 5525 的 PD 诱骗线（也越 100W 的转接头），再买一个小米的 120W 充电头，我就不用背着 GS43VR 的砖样 180W 充电器了整天往外跑了，好累。
感觉忽然解放了，不过还没有收到货，收到货了再说。
GS43Vr 的台达电源有 180W ，电压和电流输出接近 20V-10A （具体是 19.** 和 9.**记不清了）。
应该是个好方案。</span>

步骤：点击输入框 &#x3D;&gt; 点击“用 Bitwarden 填充” ​&#x3D;&gt; 解锁 &#x3D;&gt; 出现查询 xxx.com 的界面，但是没有结果 &#x3D;&gt; 等待 3~4 秒才出现结果。
手机：红米 K20Pro ； MIUI12 ； bitwarden 使用一年前的版本，今天更新到最新版，问题还在。
当然我并不是经常需要填充密码，平均一周一次，所以 3~4s 影响也不大。
但是我很好奇是不是只有我一个人有这个问题？毕竟在 v2 经常看到有人推荐 Bitwarden ，但是从来没看到有人提到过这个问题。
如果提前解锁 Bitwarden ，点击输入框立刻就有相应网站的密码提示，点击用“用 Bitwarden 填充”跳转到 app 也能立刻就展示结果。
但是刚解锁成功后也有 3~4 秒在转圈，搜索按钮无法点击。这是在连接服务器同步数据吗？每次打开时都同步一次？
我在电脑上用浏览器扩展，设置永不加锁，倒是从来没注意过。
安卓上还试过 enpass 和 safeincloud ，也没有这个问题。所以我猜问题就是同步？</span>

以前这种说法在一些安卓手机交流群比较常见，比如之前用三星就有人说安卓大版本升级线刷&gt;双清（重置出厂）升级&gt;直接升级。
这个也没经过什么验证，但挺多人都这么说，所以也不清楚是否确有其事，是不是重新安装会比较干净。
然后最近也听到了 win10 大版本或长时间不升级，重装比直接升级干净稳定的说法，搞得我现在 1909 也不知道要不要开自动升级到 21 版本（之前把升级服务禁用了）。所以求证下是否有这种说法？感觉有的说法挺玄学的，但又没有什么实例。</span>

A e2 &#x3D; returnValue_2();打印两次是因为：执行A()打印了 default constructor ，然后 return 时经过 RVO 优化，就少打印一次。但由于函数返回值类型为 A&amp;&amp;，作为 亡值，就必须调用 移动构造函数。
但 A e1 &#x3D; returnValue_1();为什么打印这两句阿？（它的返回值类型就是 A ，不是 A&amp;&amp;啊）

                    <span>TongTX: “下午 2-3 点我需要占用测试环境联调项目，大家不要发布喔！”
看到群里的消息我内心一阵苦恼，由于公司使用的是微服务架构并将其部署在了 Kubernetes 集群上，因此团队负责开发的服务是整个微服务架构其中的一环，整个系统的正常运行需要依赖微服务系统中的上下游服务，这导致每每到了发新版本的窗口期，大家都开始占用测试环境联调测试自己开发的功能，导致排队使用测试环境的情况。
今天是发版日，我也需要将自己的功能发布至测试环境验证功能是否正确，有人占用测试环境的话会导致我无法随意测试与修复功能，排队使用测试环境会影响我的发布效率，到时候又要被产品经理吐槽上线慢了:(
“那我安排在 3-4 点” 团队里另一名工程师在群里说。
看到测试环境的使用时间不断被挤压，我也顾不上是否需真要用一个小时，赶紧在群里喊“我预期 5 点开 PR 合并代码，所以 4-5 点我要测试一下，用好了会通知大家。”
想必各位使用微服务架构的同仁和我有一样的困扰，那就是“集成测试联调真的太他丫讨厌了！”，尤其一到发新版本的窗口期，测试环境简直犹如网红餐厅，大排长龙，各个功能都要测，只能乖乖等。很多公司和我在的这家企业一样，只有一套测试环境，一到发版前各个项目时间都很紧，全挤一起。尤其现在敏捷开发迭代周期越来越短，测试也越来越频繁，测试环境着实是不够用啊。
于是我去找了找目前有没有能解决这个问题的方案，发现有一些工具链可以解决这个排队耗时问题，比如 TeamCode( https://www.teamcode.com)新推出的微服务集成测试工具 KubeOrbit( https://www.kubeorbit.io)，帮助团队高效测试微服务。
我打开他发来的产品文档，发现此工具允许我在公司测试环境的 Kubernetes 集群中定义基准环境：
$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment version&#x3D;base
我还可以基于基准环境创建不同的测试通道，比如测试环境 1 和测试环境 2：
# Create a test env with name v1
$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version&#x3D;v1
# Create a test env with name v2
$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version&#x3D;v2
将自己的服务加入目标测试环境
apiVersion: network.kubeorbit.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceRoute
metadata:
  name: serviceroute-sample
  namespace: sample-namespace
spec:
  name: pod-svc
  # Add your service to the test env named with v1 by defining trafficRoutes
  trafficRoutes:
    routes:
      - name: v1
        labels:
          version: v1
        headers:
          version:
            exact: v1
    default:
      version: base
部署到目标测试环境中   
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/serviceroute.yaml
使用体验总结
KubeOrbit 工具主要有如下三种功能：在微服务测试环境内创建测试通道，这样就可以获得一个单独稳定的集成测试环境；把需要测试的微服务添加至测试通道中，将它们与其他不同版本的微服务隔离开来；在发起微服务请求的时候指定测试通道，KubeOrbit 会将其转发至你所指定的测试通道。这些功能刚好解决了我和团队耗时排队测试的困境，满足了团队测试的需求：
1. 团队内部并行开发与联调测试的需求，大家无需再争抢使用测试环境
2. 按时交付项目的需求，避免了因为测试环境不够导致项目延期的情况
无需调整已有的技术栈和架构，KubeOrbit 会适配现有的微服务，还能够隔离不同测试通道之间的通讯。但是在产品的使用过程中，我发现还需要有较多的人工操作，增加了这个工具的使用门槛。如果能够把这些流程自动化，会给用户体验带来较大幅度的提升。刚好从公众号得知产品在 GitHub （ https://github.com/teamcode-inc/kubeorbit ）全部开源的消息，我也打算好好研究一下，持续关注这个项目和平台，希望未来有更好的体验。</span>

大噶好，sao 年回来啦，上周五刚结束期末考试，迫不及待地想写点东西，上篇的总结中，给自己立了几个 flag ，我也打算通过一系列的文章来记录我这一年的英国留学之路，希望能给后来者一些借鉴。由于期末考刚结束，趁热打铁，所以这篇文章就讲讲英国疫情下的考试吧。
寒假
9 月开学，我是 10 月中旬来的学校，感觉没过多久就放寒假了！大概 12 月 10 号左右，课结束寒假也就开始了。1 月初，学校的工作人员就开始上班了，但是还没有开学，因为这几个星期是他们称作的“考试周”，是有点奇怪，英国这边是先过年（圣诞🎄），再考试。真幸福啊，开开心心过年，不用担心亲戚朋友问考试成绩。考试周其实比较无聊，一个星期基本只有一场考试，其余时间就是给你复习，不像国内，考试战线拉得很长。考试周就是用来复习考试的，没有任何娱乐活动，学校怕你没有时间复习，或者是太多的考试让你焦虑，这一点从很多方面都能体会到：
发邮件告诉我们考试周不要举办任何 party ，以免打扰别人考试 /学习
学校提供 online peer supports ，帮助解决烦恼 /压力
总之，学校希望每个学生不要suffer in silence，不光是在考试时。（ PS：考试期间，厕所广告栏都特意换了）

如果加上考试周，算算寒假还是挺长的，期待开学～
考试
分数组成
这边分数的大头其实还是以考试为主，再结合平时的实验或者作业之类的，

比如这门课，平时作业占**20%，期末考试占80%**。另外，如果是那种没有考试，只有写论文的课，那就只需要写论文，也没有什么平时成绩，比如：

这些信息都是公开的，是在选学校，选专业时的一个重要的衡量标准。我有一门课就需要提交3000 字论文，大半个寒假都在整这个论文。
考试形式
由于疫情，从去年开始这边所有考试都是Open book（现在所有学校都是这样的），就是给你一…</span>

网络中始终从路由 DHCP 获取 IP （网关 192.168.100.1 ）
宿主机物理网卡为 enp3s0,该网卡 master 为 br0
br0 是我自己添加一个网桥，可以从路由正常获取 IP （ 192.168.100.5 ）且正常上网
这个时候我使用 qemu 创建一个虚拟机，网络部分使用
-net nic -net tap,ifname&#x3D;tap0,helper&#x3D;/xxxxxxx/qemu-bridge-helper
如此这般启动了虚拟机，虚拟机无法 DHCP 获取 IP ，
手动配置 IP （ 192.168.100.6 ）后
ping 回环没问题，
ping 192.168.100.6 没问题，
ping 192.168.100.5 没问题
ping 192.168.100.1 不通
使用 brctl show 查看网桥发现 enp3s0 和 虚拟机使用的 tap0 都在此网桥下
使用 ip link show 查看发现 br0 enp3s0 tap0 都是 UP 状态

宿主机上网没有问题，就是他妹的虚拟机无法过网关。
不知道有没有朋友研究过这方面的坑，来分享一二，好让我早点睡觉！

今天忽然和我说:&quot;不支持平台统收，且高比例平台服务费不属于高比例支持的场景。暂不支持配置高比例，请知悉&quot;
我当前的业务描述：第三方平台在我这里提供教学资源（题目，试卷，视频等），然后用户在平台上购买资料的时候，通过微信的分账接口直接将入账的金额按比例分给指定的用户（为什么要申请高比例分账：因为微信分账金额大于收款金额的 30%的时候需要申请更高的比例分账，大多数三方平台要的分账比例都大于了 30%）。
有人申请过嘛，我已经等待的绝望了。。。。。。。主要是微信那边也不给个具体的答复。</span>

目前在内网里面搭了一个 NextCloud ，想要使用基于 WebRTC 的 NextCloud Talk
因为没有打算开放到公网上，所以协议走的一直都是 http ，也不打算用自签名证书。
但是这就带来了一个问题：WebRTC 除了访问 localhost ，要求全部使用 https 。不然浏览器会阻止网页使用麦克风和摄像头。
Google 后发现 Chrome 有一个 workaround ，就是在启动项里面配置一个--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure 来忽略这个限制。虽然不完美但是确实可以用。
想问问大家，Firefox 和 Chrome 中有没有什么地方可以配置这个东西，让我可以永久的忽视这个安全策略，通过 http 可以访问到麦克风和摄像头权限？

往年都是带 Mac 回家的，啥问题也没有，换了 m1 Mac 也没遇到啥奇奇怪怪的问题。
今年迷上了戴森球，所以就带了小新 Pro 16 笔记本回家，想着还能打游戏，但是为了方便我没带原装那个超大的充电器，就带了 65w 的 pd 头子，然后噩梦开始了。
今天早上开机，发现一切都变得非常卡顿，点个右键都要转 4-5 秒钟，经过一番排查发现是 CPU 被限制到 0.5GHZ ，拔掉电源马上恢复，实属拔掉电源提升性能。。
然后开始在网上搜索，发现不止我一个人遇到这个问题，有一个人发帖说是 type c 的一个 bug ，联想的工程师给了他一个新的 BIOS （官网没有最新的版本），刷了就好了，但是只能临时生效，过一段时间又不行，于是我马上去找联想客服，结果死也不肯给我 BIOS 文件，非要我去工作站刷，我说我在老家去工作站不方便，也不肯给我。
现在就只能拔掉电源用，没电了再充电，等我回深圳再去修。。</span>

在如今这个知识爆炸、信息满天飞的时代，你是如何学习的？又是如何积累的？在你获取这些信息、知识后，哪些知识是有用的? 些信息又该剔除掉？ 
以上是我在多年的生活、工作、学习中所遇到的问题，我是一个笔记产品的重度使用者，所以我在面临这些问题的时候第一个想到的就是不管三七二十一，记下再说、收藏再说。
有没有一款笔记产品可以解决这些问题？可以快速记录不至于漏下信息，又可以在适当的时间去筛选整理。
我从手机的备忘录到印象笔记、有道云笔记、我来笔记，这些产品固然好，可是他的臃肿却让我望而却步，记下的碎片信息如同石沉大海一般，再难找回。
现在我发现了一款笔记产品---方寸笔迹。
 
方寸笔迹采用的是索引化的知识管理方式，脱离了传统笔记本的结构。

同时在快速记录这一方面，可以在微信公众号输入文字、图片或者直接语音记录，以达到快速记录的目的，非常方便，而且在每周一会主动提示周记录统计，这样我在记录下的同时，可以在好好整理我的知识与信息。

最后，我觉得记录是一件很有意义的事情，记录也是思考的一种方式。不要让记录成为你的心智负担，把这个工作交给工具去做。
这个是方寸笔迹交流群，创始人也在里面，如果有问题可以直接向他提出。</span>

1：我的情况是周末经常要带上 mac mini m1 回乡下住，所以乡下家里也准备了一个显示器，但是那块就会闪屏，搜索了各种解决方案，没解决。
如果显示器闪屏算是硬件兼容性问题的话。
2:输入法的问题貌似很多人都遇到了，不管是第三方还是自带，只有切换窗口才能恢复！
有哪位大佬遇到并解决了？</span>

Vue Code View(VCV)





一个基于 vue 2.x的轻量代码交互组件，在网页中可以编辑、运行并实时预览代码效果展示。
当阅读包含大量代码的文档时，很多项目文档通过 markdown loader 实现了示例代码的 render 展示，但它是静态的。当我们想调试代码时，一般需要打开本地 IDE 或者打开 codepen， codesandbox等在线编辑器网站，也会受制于电脑是否安装开发环境或者网络连接是否顺畅。
那么能不能有这么一个组件能支持在页面中编辑代码，在网页中可以编辑、运行并实时预览代码效果展示？
特别感谢组件 react-code-view，基于此编写了 vue 版本的组件！使用此组件在 vue 页面还是 markdown 文档中的多示例代码，都可以实时编辑运行代码、预览效果。
在线预览
 
在线预览: https://andurils.github.io/vue-code-view/#/demo
codesandbox 示例: vue-code-view-example
✨ 特性
💻 代码可以在线编辑，实时预览效果。
🎨 支持示例代码高亮，配置主题。
🌈 支持  解析渲染。
📑 支持 Markdown 文件示例渲染。
📦 安装
npm i vue-code-view
# or
yarn add vue-code-view

🔨 配置
使用vue cli需要在vue.config.js文件进行配置，支持使用包含运行时编译器的 Vue 构建版本。
module.exports &#x3D; {
  runtimeCompiler: true,
  // or
  chainWebpack: (config) &#x3D;&gt; { 
    config.resolve.alias
      .set(&quot;vue$&quot;, &quot;vue/dist/vue.esm.js&quot;);
  },
}; 

💻 示例
入口文件 main.js 中引入组件,不需要手动引入样式。
import Vue from &quot;vue&quot;;
import App from &quot;./App.vue&quot;;
import CodeView from &quot;vue-code-view&quot;;

Vue.use(CodeView);

new Vue({
  router,
  store,
  render: (h) &#x3D;&gt; h(App),
}).$mount(&quot;#app&quot;);

一般来说，WEB 是一个 html 主页面，里面包含若干个 css/js 。正常 html 是不缓存，确保浏览器每次访问都是最新的内容（服务器返回 200 或者 304)。
而 css/js 是时间策略缓存，也就是没过期之间（由 max-age 来定），浏览器压根不会向服务器发任何请求！就算 JS 代码有更新，短时间内用户也无法感知。
为了破除这个限制，webpack 都会在 js/css 后面加上 hash ，来解决这个问题。
那么问题来了，为什么 HTTP 不设计成，能一次性的向服务器请求 HTML 里所有 css/js 的最后更新时间（ last-modified-time ），看看有哪些文件变动了，再针对性的获取呢? 这样 JS 就不用每次都改新文件名了。</span>

PhoneCast：将你的 iPhone 屏幕投射到 Mac 上

平台：iOS / iPadOS / macOS
关键词：投屏、演示

@化学心情下2：PhoneCast 是一款可以将iOS 设备屏幕投射到 Mac 上的工具，其原理也很容易理解——通过 iOS 内置录屏功能将画面录制并直播，而 Mac 端则通过接收并回放的形式在桌面通过窗口展示出来，从而间接的实现了 iOS 屏幕投射到 Mac 上。

操作上也不复杂，在 iOS 端和 Mac 端分别安装 PhoneCast，Mac 作为接收端只需要运行并放置到后台即可，而 iOS 端只需要在首页中点击 Power to Start boradcast，之后在「直播屏幕」中选中 Phonecast 后点击 「开始直播」，等待直播开始后即可将 Phonecast 放到后台运行；如果 Mac 和 iPhone 处于同一个局域网，那么你会很快在 Mac 桌面看到一个显示 iOS 桌面的窗口，你在 iOS 上的操作都会同步在 Mac 上的这个小窗口显示。

当然这样直接的投射虽然能用上，但你可以看到画面并不清晰，因此你也可以通过解锁内购的方式来开启高画质投屏，对应地你还可以通过购买订阅的方式来开启所有高级功能，比如说自动根据手持方向旋转投屏的画面，只投射声音等等。而在开启高画质之后，则需要注意…</span>

                    <span>对于我们而言，春节总是会和「相聚」所联系在一起。在这些阖家欢聚的日子里，不妨借助游戏的力量，为亲朋好友们再增添一份快乐吧！
下文中要介绍的，都是支持本地多人同屏（2-4 人）游玩的游戏作品；它们皆收获了不少好评，玩法易于上手，其中不少也能在 Switch 上玩到。无论男女老少，皆可从这些多人作品中收获无穷乐趣。

是想在小棋盘中用各种小游戏一较高下？抑或是要考验大家的节奏感？还是打算在「河川生存战」中与其他玩家劲往一处使，齐心协力突破难关？从传统的小游戏 PK，到新颖的合作体验，《超级马力欧派对》统统囊括，定能让你（和其他玩家）感受到只属于 Switch 的派对乐趣。
如果你恰巧财力雄厚……还可以买两台 Switch 和两份游戏，然后将它们的画面拼在一起，体验跨越不同屏幕的游戏模式。

游戏平台：Switch
玩家人数：最多 4 人
参考售价：429 港币（港版）、299 元（国行）

马力欧派对 超级巨星

和强调体感，活用机能的《超级马力欧派对》不同；《马力欧派对 超级巨星》将重心放到了系列的「传统艺能」，类似大富翁的棋盘游戏上。《超级巨星》收录了 5 张各具特色的经典棋盘，每张棋盘皆有着独特的事件与机关；四名玩家各自掷骰前进，靠小游戏赚取用于置换星星的金币，最后比拼谁的星星与金币数量最多 —— 但就像前面说的那样，这些地图可不简单。好好利用的话，也许能获得意想不到的大反转——？

说到小游戏，本作收录的数量多达 100 款；它们皆是从历代作品中精选而来，并且和棋盘一样…</span>

在完成考试离开象牙塔之后，接下来面临的就是选报学校和专业的问题。和十几年前相比，现在报选学校的流程已经人性化了许多，至少可以把确认学校的时间放在分数公布之后，省去了估算分数的麻烦，也避免了很多高分低走和被迫滑档甚至复读的痛苦。
但这样的设计只能解决「选上学校」的问题，相比之下，要在高考结束之后选择自己未来几年走向的专业科系才是更大的麻烦。目前，大部分学校的转专业体系仍然不太完善，无论是采用高考分数筛选、额外设置考试还是其他特殊规则，转专业制度仍然不能满足所有人的需求。
而且，由于对自身追求探索和实际生活阅历的双重不足，有不少人在实际深入大二甚至更晚的专业课程后才能发现，那个在家人、老师等等「参谋」之下选定的「好专业」根本不适合自己。错过本科的转专业考试之后，无论跨专业考研还是选择与自身专业相去甚远的工作，需要面对的精神压力和沉没成本都成倍增加，不少人在这样的衡量中逡巡不前，无法抉择。
作为曾经跨专业考研成功的人，我觉得或许有必要讲讲改换专业的故事。我找到了一些朋友，他们有的本科参加了转专业考试，有的选择了跨专业考研，有的在毕业后选择了与专业不同的工作。希望这些故事和经历，可以在你想做出这样的重大决策时，或多或少地提供一些帮助。

你为什么要转/跨专业？
离开原有专业是一个需要勇气的决定。探索未知的体验十分新奇，但未知本身正是恐惧的来源。因此，转专业的动机尤为重要，需要一个坚定的想法作为引导，才能维持你在这条未知的道路上持续前进。
参与采访的八位朋友基本分为两类。一种是对专业的兴趣随着自我探索的进程迁移，或是发现自己选择的专业实际体验与预期不符，…</span>

手机虚拟机是什么？
手机虚拟机，用过电脑虚拟机的听到应该也不会陌生，其实就是内置在手机本体内的又一个系统。它虽然是模拟真机环境，但与本机系统最大的区别在于：你拥有对该系统的自主掌控权，也就是常说的「自带 root」或者「免 root」，多用于软件测试（包括安装非官方渠道应用）和应用多开。

提到这里，不免要区分下云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机。
云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机的区别
云手机：运行在 ARM 架构（适用于移动通讯领域）的服务器上，性能由服务器决定，用户需要通过远程访问云手机操控，不影响本机系统，但也存在网络延迟现象。
Android 模拟器：其实与手机虚拟机类似。Android 模拟器运行在电脑端，需要通过键盘鼠标来操控。对于习惯手游的用户来说，除特殊需求，使用频率并不算高。
手机虚拟机：运行在手机内，占用手机内存和运算能力，因而手机性能的高地直接决定了虚拟机的运行流畅度，优势是共享真机网络。
三者各有优势，加上成本因素（包括金钱和操作）来考量的话，倾向使用手机虚拟机的人越来越多。毕竟对于生活玩家来说，一台手机上就能免费完成应用多开、软件测试的需求，何乐而不为。
常见的手机虚拟机有哪些，优缺点是什么？
真机性能越好，虚拟机运行才会越流畅，类比在手机里运行的游戏应用。这几年各大手机厂商都在疯狂给手机加配置，又正是洞察到了我们的需求。
市场上主流的三款虚拟机也都一一使用过一段时间（仅以酷安上的数据为参照）。

VMOS Pro、光速和 51 虚拟机，三者其实大同小异，最受欢迎的多开，悬浮窗，挂机等…</span>

美联储发布报告讨论数字货币利弊

1 月 20 日，美国联邦储备委员会发布了关于数字货币的研究报告。这份题为《货币与支付：数字转型时代的美元》（Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation）的报告原定于去年夏天发布，目的在于征求公众意见，为美联储决定是否发行央行数字货币提供参考。
报告指出，数字美元（CBDC）可以从根本上改变美国金融体系的结构，改变私营部门和中央银行的角色和责任，具有确保美元在国际金融体系中继续维持领先地位、改善跨境支付、增加金融包容性并简化美元在新技术中的使用等好处。同时，报告也对可能产生的负面影响发出了警告，包括夺走传统银行业的存款，挤兑金融公司、隐私保护和打击非法融资等问题亟需考虑等。
但是，这份报告没有提出政策建议，也没有就是否支持推出数字美元发出明确信号。美联储强调，在没有白宫和国会明确支持的情况下，它不会采取进一步行动。目前，美联储官员内部对于数字美元的立场存在分歧。
此外，1 月 21 日，俄罗斯央行也发布了一份关于加密货币的报告，加密货币可能破坏国民经济，增加监管机构维持货币政策的难度；因此，建议政府立法禁止加密货币相关活动。来源

在中国人的食谱中，烧烤是最特殊的存在。代表餐桌审美的川、鲁、粤、淮扬等大菜系里，几乎找不到烧烤的影子。无论是川菜里的开水白菜、麻婆豆腐；鲁菜里的葱烧海参、九转大肠；粤菜里的白切鸡、豉汁排骨；淮扬菜里的狮子头、大煮干丝。它们的共同点是，以蒸、煮作为最上档次、最政治正确的烹饪方式，炒次之，煎、炸再次之。而烧烤，则在被默认为是不上台面、不能用于高级食材的烹饪方式——中餐烹饪鄙视链的底端。



与这种观念截然相反的是，在几乎所有的中国城市、乡村中，烧烤是人人青睐、家家热爱的好物。无论宵夜小酒、露营户外、好友聚会或者阖家团圆，只要一炉烧烤镇场，那就有了氛围和排面。
不能处庙堂之高，则居江湖之远；不能赏炊金馔玉，则谋锦绣膏粱。烧烤，代表了中国饮食最草莽、最市井、最家常和最温情的那一面，也凝聚了中国人所有的因地制宜、圆融变通、行侠好义和林下风致。

烧烤的历史，远远早于其他烹饪方式。炖煮需要防水耐火的容器、蒸需要容器里加装隔水装置、煎炸需要食用油的榨取技术，但烧烤却什么都不用：几根树枝，一堆火，就能让腥膻的生肉，变成油花四溢，香气扑鼻的烤肉。也许在没有文字的时代，烧烤已经成为人们告别茹毛饮血的捷径。

但严格说来，“烧”和“烤”两个汉字，含义并不相同。《说文解字》对“烧”的释义是一个更复杂的字“爇”。从字形理解，就是捂在草堆下加热。



今天，在云南滇西地区还存在着一种古老的美食“火烧肉”，当地人有时又称之为“大烧”。制作很简单，把整猪肉埋入柴草堆里，点燃，慢慢等待火焰燃烧、熄灭。然后洗掉猪皮表面烧焦的地方，剩下半生不熟的猪肉切薄片后凉拌吃。



不能吃生的外地人，可以只要较熟的外层，而本地人则更倾向于连生带熟一起吃。不是这个，不够鲜嫩滑爽。无疑，这是古老的“烧”保存至今的饮食活化石，也是汉语、…</span>

                    <span>发现植入到 UEFI 固件中的恶意程序

研究人员通过固件扫描器的日志发现了一个 植入 到 UEFI 固件中的恶意程序 MoonBounce。该扫描器自 2019 年初以来已被整合到卡巴斯基产品中。恶意程序修改了主板上的 SPI 闪存，它不在硬盘上，因此格式化硬盘或更换硬盘不会清除恶意程序。修改后的固件镜像允许攻击者拦截引导序列的执行流，引入一个复杂的感染链。由于感染链只在内存中运行，而在硬盘上没有留下攻击痕迹。该恶意程序可以部署用户模式的恶意软件，从互联网上下载并执行的更多的有效载荷。


老王点评：真是无孔不入，这些恶意程序真是能别开生面的发现利用方法。




FSF 让其 5000 多名准会员提名董事会成员

自由软件基金会（FSF）董事会前几天通过了 新程序，在其 37 年的历史上，第一次可以让其准会员提名其董事会成员。FSF 打算在 2022 年利用这些新程序首先增加几个新董事，然后开始对现有董事进行审查。包括所有现任董事在内的有投票权的成员可以参与投票。FSF 主席说：“向我们的准会员开放董事招聘程序是 FSF 的一个历史性的、受欢迎的里程碑。”该流程是由顾问主导的六个月审查的主要成果。


老王点评：作为开源先锋，FSF 能践行社区治理是一个进步。




Linux 大量向用户提供了固件更新

本周早些时候，在上传了许多新的系统固件文件后，Linux 供应商固件服务提供了大量下载服务。这些固件解决的问题尚未披露，似乎是一个“高度严重的即将到来的安全问题”，但据分析是在更新英特尔 CPU 的微代码。经过 测试发现，无论新的安全问题是什么，它似乎都没有任何广泛的性能影响。


老王点评：在这种时候，就感觉到了 Linux 供应商固件服务的重要性。

2021 年，我们发表了远超 150 篇的 Linux 方面的文章。从桌面 Linux 用户小工具的文章到将 Linux 作为服务器操作系统的教程，以及介乎于两者之间的各种场景，这些文章已经涵盖了 Linux 生态系统的许多方面。所有这些文章都值得你花时间去阅读，但你可以从今年发表的这十篇好文章开始阅读。

3 个开源工具，使 Linux 成为理想的工作站

在这篇文章中，Seth Kenlon 介绍了 LibreOffice、AbiWord、Gnumeric 和 Pandoc，涵盖了 使 Linux 成为理想工作站的工具。他解释了在使用 Linux 作为桌面操作系统时，这些应用程序如何使你的工作效率提高。文章探讨了一些高级功能，如 LibreOffice 的无头模式，并提供了如何充分利用每个应用程序的小技巧。

为什么我在 Linux 上使用 exa 而不是 ls

ls 命令是 Linux 中最常用的终端命令之一，但你知道它有一个现代的替代品，提供了许多有益的改进吗？Sudeshna Sur 的 文章 介绍了 exa 命令以及它相比 ls 的优势，讨论了 exa 如何跟踪添加到 Git 仓库的新文件、显示目录和文件树等等。

我喜欢在 Linux 上编码的 5 个原因

像许多人一样，Seth Kenlon 喜欢在 Linux 上编码。在这篇文章中，他分享了这样做的 五个原因。他喜欢在 Linux 上编码，因为它建立在逻辑的基础上，可以让你欣赏代码之间的关联，提供了源代码，并提供直接访问外设和抽象层的能力，使编写代码更容易。

                    <span>开源硬件现在是一个独立领域，并且正在快速的成长中。




在软件行业中，各种类型的程序员写代码的职业已经变得很普遍，这些代码通过开源许可证发布到公共场所。业界的猎头们通常要求查看这些代码来审查未来员工候选人。那些将自己职业生涯专注在开源项目开发的人得到了回报。从 payscale.com 网站得知，Linux 系统管理员的收入比 Windows 管理员要高，这表明从事开源软件领域可以获得更高的报酬和更稳定的工作机会。分享你的工作会让你感觉良好（这甚至可能是一种因果报应），你知道自己正在为整个世界创造价值。历史上，这样的机会可从来没有为我们这些从事于开源硬件领域的人存在过。

二十多年前，几乎没有人知道开源硬件是什么，更别说围绕它规划自己的职业生涯了。举例而言，在 2000 年全世界发表了超过 200 万篇学术论文，却只有 7 篇文章提到过“开源硬件”。在我第一次写《开源实验室》 的时候，我收集了每一个案例（其实也就几十个），并且可以轻松的跟上和阅读每一篇发布的关于开源硬件的文章，还把它们发布到维基上。我很高兴的报告大家，这种情况现在已经实际上不可能了。今年已经有超过 1500 篇文章在讨论“开源硬件”，而且我相信年底的时候还会有更多的文章发表出来。开源硬件现在已经是一个独立的领域，有一些专门报导它的杂志（比如说 《HardwareX》 和 《Journal of Open Hardware》）。在更多的领域中，数十种传统杂志现在也会定期报道最新的开源硬件的发展。



开发智能开源硬件 3-D 打印 (Joshua Pearce, GNU-FDL)

即使是在十年前，从职业生涯的角度看，强调开源硬件开发在某种程度上也是一种冒险。我记得在我上一份工作的简历中，我淡化了和它相关的内容，更多的强调了我的传统工作。工业界和学术界的管理人员难以明白如果这些设计被送出去…</span>

                    <span>I spent a few days playing around with bootloaders for the first
time. This post builds up to a text editor with a few keyboard
shortcuts. I&#x27;ll be giving a virtual talk based on this work at Hacker
Nights on Jan 27.
There are a definitely bugs. But it&#x27;s hard to find intermediate
resources for bootloader programming so maybe parts of this will be
useful.
If you already know the basics and the intermediates and just want a
fantastic intermediate+ tutorial, maybe try
this. It
is very good.
The code on this post is available on
Github, but it&#x27;s more of a
mess than my usual project.
Motivation: Snake
You remember snake bootloader in a
tweet from a few
years ago?
Install qemu (on macOS or Linux), nasm, and copy the snake.asm
source code to disk from that blog post.

                    <span>When I started using Linux in the 1990s, I was in my mid-40s and accessibility was not something I gave much thought to. Now, however, as I&#x27;m pushing 70, my needs have changed. A few years ago, I purchased a brand new Darter Pro from System76, and its default resolution is 1920x1080, and it&#x27;s high DPI, too. The system came with Pop_OS!, which I found that I had to modify to be able to see the icons and text on the display. Thank goodness that Linux on the desktop has become much more accessible than in the 1990s.

效果图
大家不要误会，效果图不是上面的图。。。上面的图太复杂了，我画的老虎可没有这么好看😂。。





哈哈哈，是不太好看哈。。不要在意那些细节，这不重要！重要的是迎接 2022 年虎年的那颗炙热且纯真的心，还加了点动画，当点击老虎的头的时候会动。。。

在这里先祝大家在虎年虎虎生威，每天都能虎虎大睡！
思路
本来想画一个好看的老虎，但真的动手的时候就有点不知所措了，本来想的一层一层放图片，就有点 PS 那意思了，那样效果确实比这个好，但是诚意和这个一笔一笔画的就不一样了。
后来决定通过 Path 来进行绘制，因为 Compose 中的 Path 在之前的项目中使用的较少，那就来吧，跟着我一步一步来画这个丑老虎吧。
开始撸码
画脑袋
先来画老虎脑袋吧，说好听点叫老虎脑袋，说不好听点那就是个圆。。。
val size &#x3D; this.size
val path &#x3D; Path()
path.moveTo(size.width / 2, bigSize)
val start &#x3D; size.width / 6
​
// 画圆
path.addOval(Rect(start, 300f, start * 5, 300 + start * 5 - start))
path.close()
​
drawPath(path &#x3D; path, color &#x3D; Color.Yellow,
         style &#x3D; Stroke(width &#x3D; 10f))

Path 直接通过 addOval 就可以画一个圆，然后计算出圆的位置就行，下面来看下效果吧：

画头上的王字
脑袋画完了，接下来画一下老虎头上的王字，这是老虎的标志啊！
// 写头上的王字
path.addRect(Rect(start * 3 - 40f, 300f + 60f, …</span>

话不多说直接上图

从图中可知，分为上下两部分，上部分是传统春联和福字，代表对大家的新年祝福，下部分是主要功能模块，包含红包金额、新年幸运签和是与不是。
采用Kotlin语言进行编写，涉及到的技术有：ConstraintLayout、Drawable、
自定义View、Android动画、Viewpager2、字体的设置和传感器的使用。
创意来源
这个创意的来源，主要是年纪大了，过年肯定要给侄子侄女发红包，哈哈哈，这回金额可以他们自己摇出来，具有互动和随机性比较好玩，为新年增添一份乐趣！
新年幸运签是给大家的祝福！
大家肯定会有很多场景，会产生选择困难，所以是与不是这个模块就是解决此类问题添加的！
新年也要动起来呀，刚好传统的摇签可以用手机摇一摇来模拟效果，活动手腕一举两得（真是个好点子啊）！
安卓手机的小伙伴可以下载安装包 体验一把，我是停不下来！
正文开始啦
首先这个布局看起来挺简单的对吧，LinearLayout设置方向vertical，中间在用一个LinearLayout设置方向horizontal。

但是这就产生了一个问题，布局嵌套，所以这也是我为什么采用ConstraintLayout来实现的原因，如下图，只用了一层。

ConstraintLayout使用
啰嗦两句，有的小伙伴可以没用过，可以参考下

在ConstraintLayout中的控件横竖两个方向都至少要选择一个进行约束，否则控件将在左上角进行摆放。
top指顶部bottom指底部start指左边end指右边，上例子



这是横批的文字，可以看到，它的顶部和父布局的顶部相约束，左边和父布局的左边相约束，右边和父布局的右边相约束。

横向居中需要左右都加约束，不需要的话，想让控…</span>

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战
有一天，
我正听着歌，开心的敲着代码，这时候小王同志急冲冲的跑过来拍了拍我的肩膀，
“付老板，我这遇到一个问题，连续两次请求同一个接口，参数传的不同，但是livedata的onChange回调只走了一次，UI界面上只有一个地方更新成功了，这是咋回事啊？”
一听有bug，这我可就来劲了，立马摘下耳机，
“来，上代码”，
“诶~ 你这是在UI层注册了一个监听，然后在请求接口的地方，利用livedata连续postValue两次。看情况你这应该是postValue搞的鬼，不急，我来模拟下场景，看看他的内部实现”。
新建一个ViewModel，创建一个String类型值的MutableLiveData，向外抛出一个更新String值的方法，并且使用liveData的postValue来通知UI更新数据。
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {

    val countLiveData &#x3D; MutableLiveData()
    var title: String &#x3D; &quot;&quot;

    /**
     * livedata postValue
     */
    fun updateTitlePost(str:String) {
        title &#x3D; str
        countLiveData.postValue(title)
    } 
}

activity上直接注册一个Observer，并且在button的click中连续两次调用viewModel中更新String值的方法。

Hi，很高兴见到你！👋🏻
本文主要分享 Android 无障碍功能 的一些优化经验，希望看完本篇，可以帮助到你，以及哪些特殊的用户群体。
前言
最近我们团队收到了一些用户的反馈：

有用户反馈，我们的部分功能按钮在无障碍下无法正常识别。其实这已经不是我第一次看到反馈了，第一次是16年ios端收到了用户的反馈，进行过一次优化。说来惭愧，反而是我们 Android 这边也一直没有专门适配。
什么是无障碍功能？
对于一些视障人群或者听障人群而言，普通的App对它们来说使用起来可能困难重重。在 Android 上，对于这些用户用户而言，主要通过系统附带的屏幕阅读器 TalkBack 来进行控制设备。
所以无障碍功能是应用开发中的重要组成部分，通过集成无障碍功能和服务，可以提高应用的易用性尤其是对于残障用户而言。
背景与现状
我国现在 1691万 视障人士，2780万 听障人士，2977万 肢体残障人士，数据来源于 2021年第7次 人口普查，中国互联网络信息中心官网。
在国内，专门去处理的并不太多，一是因为这件事情很多开发者并不知晓(我们下面会提到为什么)，再者相对而言的收益可能并不高及一般也没有用户反馈，这件事情就一直没有太被重视，对于 无障碍功能 ，可能更多是部分工具App中常见，比如某些抢红包等插件。
而 无障碍功能 的适配在国外却是相对比较常见的一个事，甚至于某些国家如果不做适配可能会无法上架；
纵观业内，腾讯系产品在这方面做的比较好，当然这与他们内部标准的开发规则及庞大的 用户群体 也有关系。
那为什么大多数开发者不知晓呢？
其实主要源于 Android原生UI 对于 无障碍 并不是 强制性 的，所以大多数国内开发者在初入 Android 时甚至都没法…</span>

                    <span>上海又撞上疫情，连续三年春节不能回家，对父母始终有些亏欠。
昨天(春节前10天)，收到微信的提示，提示使用定制红包封面。
突然发觉这是个好主意。不能回家，那帮父母做个红包封面。自己似乎也随着红包，跟父母一起给亲戚拜年。

红包封面的设计并不复杂，小白也能轻松设计。不过前提是，要有个100粉丝的视频号或公众号。
接下来介绍下，微信红包定制的整体流程。
红包封面额度
微信发了2000个红包封面，足够我帮家里每个人定制红包的。
值得注意的是，封面会在2022年2月1日23:59过期，只能在大年初二前使用。
微信红包团队的生意算盘太响了。这活动，不但给红包封面带来大量新用户，后期也能让不少人续费红包时间。

没用获取红包封面额度也没关系，可以自行购买。封面费用是1元/个，有效期半年。
封面平台注册
领取定制红包额度后，提示登录到微信红包封面开放平台。
首次使用封面平台，需要注册并认证。如果你是用个人身份认证，注册中无付费环节。

个人认证，需要100粉丝的视频号或公众号。

注意，绑定的个人微信号需要实名认证。
红包封面设计
注册成功后，即可定制红包封面。
微信提供了 psd 和 sketch 的红包封面模板，流程参考微信红包封面官方文档。
不懂设计模板能不能用？
可以的。
零基础用小画家，有图层概念则用 Figma。
不管工具如何，你上传图片，即可完成红包设计。
示例基础图片 (推荐手写字体：杨任东竹石体)
封面注意事项

红包封面会展示公众号名称和头像。名称一年可修改两次，头像一个月可申请修改5次。因为红包是给家人用的，不方便展示公众号信息。我选了个不用的公众号，把名称和头像都修改了。
红包审核需要3个工作日，距离春节也已经很近了。如果你想在春节使用定制红包，尽快申请审核三个红包封面，避免最后关头未通过。
如果微信红包封面中出现肖像，需要授权。拜年红包还是希望有全家福，我提交了资料，但通过几率不大。

完成后的红包：

                    <span>我们活在别人设计好的标签里，如果撕掉标签，我们无法认识世界，也无法认识自己。那个挂满标签的自己活在朋友圈、某书、某博里，唯独没有活在当下。
互联网就像汽车，可以带我们到不借助工具到不了的地方。但与汽车不同的是，我们只在需要出门的时候用汽车，却时时刻刻都在上网。
我个人认为互联网斋戒完全不需要理由，因为它对我茶毒太深。我时刻想逃离但逃不掉，如果能戒掉互联网我确定自己会活的更快乐。每次周末看到手机推送的屏幕使用时间，都会心里一惊。但始终无法下定决心戒手机，一是怕别人找我有急事，二是不上网我不知道还能干啥。

花几天时间，用最俭省的费用生活，穿最朴素的衣服，然后问自己：“这是我所害怕的生活吗？” ——塞内加

我不害怕朴素的生活，但“无聊”的生活却让我害怕，“网络似乎剥夺了我专注和沉思的能力。”记者尼古拉斯·卡尔2008年在《大西洋月刊》上发表的一篇文章中坦言，“而且不只有我是这样” 。网络不仅让我们 “无法思考”，而且让我们无法忍受“无聊”。
每时每刻都被互联网刺激着，偶尔停下来我会发现自己其实非常疲惫。
上网太快乐了，有游戏的快乐、学习的快乐、还有与人交流的快乐，只要有网络我就不愁没事干。但这种把我填满的快乐，会让我在某些时候觉得可怕，有种看完《黑镜》之后的窒息感。如果一切都通过电子屏来感受，那什么是真实的呢？
为了找到“真实”，我进行了如下的“实验”：
一、个人实验
1. 中秋三天断网实验
中秋节三天假期是我的互联网安息日，这三天大家只能通过电话和短信与我联系。

为了平安的度过这三天，我提前做了一些保障措施：

买够三天要吃的食材，因为没网点不了外卖。
给自己安排好各种活动，第一天去烫了个头发、第二天去电影院看了个电影（断网前买好了电影票），第三天啥都没干。
准备好本子、实体书、钩织图解，填满自己的时间。（互联网的荼毒，为什么我不能让自己什么都不干？）

引言
作为一个普通人，在使用 iPhone 的将近 14 年时间里，Due 陪伴我走过了 6 年多的时间。并且在这 6 年多的时间里，看着很多人从 OminiFocus 用到 Things，而它牢牢霸占了我首屏上的一个固定位置，就像已经「刻」在那里了一样。
普通人的效率，也可以没那么复杂。
一、我与 GTD 的初遇
梦回 2014 年的年初，正在公车通勤路上的我，在播客上听到了《狗熊有话说》的主播，@i大狗熊 的一期关于 GTD 理论的介绍，大概意思是，关于 OmniFocus 这款时间管理应用程序的使用心得，将任务根据紧急、重要程度，分到四个象限进行归类，方便在日后进行任务管理时快速拾取，规划并掌控自己的时间，高效工作、生活。
男人至死是少年，iPhone 对我来说就是一款随身「小霸王」，琳琅满目的 App 便是各种陈列在街头拐角游戏商店中的「卡带」，而这类兼具效率和格调的 App 则犹如卡带界的「记忆卡」，令我向往和着迷。
听了这期播客之后，我便开始规划起了自己的时间管理之路，憧憬着自己掌控时间、掌控命运、升职加薪的美好未来。于是我打开 App Store，搜索关键字 OmniFocus，新鲜感带着肾上腺素刺激着我的交感神经，哪怕现在用自己的流量下载，我也要立刻得到它！
想必接下来的事情大家都能猜到，阻碍在我面前的不是那一点点流量的问题，而是熟悉的下载按钮变成了一个三位数数字，258 元。对于刚毕业找到工作的我来说，这在当时约等于我十多天的伙食费了…</span>

                    <span>作为设计师，我特别喜欢一位美食编辑说过的一段话：Food is becoming an art form more than ever before and presentation is almost as important as taste: we eat with our eyes first, don’t we?食物越来越成为了一门艺术，食物的呈现方式和味道一样重要。没有发现我们是用眼睛先来“品尝“食物的吗？
西餐中有个专业词汇就叫做”Food Presentation[1]”, 直译就是“食物的汇报“（意译是食物的呈现方式），这个直译是不是特别的形象？就像是我们一个项目结束，精心准备了一个从排版到内容无比精良又吸引人的的PPT，去给客户做汇报；美好的食物原材料也在厨师的精心烹饪下最后以一个漂亮又吸引人的方式呈现给了食客。

西餐（这里指的是贵西餐）因为分餐制，还有烹饪方式更多的是煎炸炖烤，最后一步“组合食材摆盘”，给我们的印象就是非常注重「摆盘的艺术」（The design in plating）,我自己在做菜和海外生活的这么多年中，也是特别喜欢学习和积累这样的食物呈现方式，毕竟好看赏心悦目的菜品谁不喜欢呢？

年夜饭或者纪念日等非常有意义的庆祝时刻，如果想露一手，非常推荐借鉴一些西式烹饪和摆盘的技巧，知道原理和方法后简单容易上手。相比起咱们中餐中造型独特美丽的菜品，比如「松鼠桂鱼」「文思豆腐」对于刀工还有火候厨艺技能的高要求，西式摆盘还是门槛低的多的多，也更容易复刻到家常餐桌上。

                    <span>感谢@知乎美食 邀（cuī）请（cù），让我在忙到起飞的年底完成了自己很早就想做的一件事，就是复制经典传统川菜给大家吃（kàn）。从下面的留言情况来看，点川菜的不多呀，但是有一个聪明可爱的朋友提到了一个东西，很多四川本地人可能也没吃过，那就是蛋圆子。我决定就Pick它了！

在介绍蛋圆子之前，我先要介绍两款有点雷同的食物。一个是武汉黄陂三鲜里的肉糕，那是用鱼肉和猪肉按1:5的比例绞成泥做的，口感弹牙，鱼肉增加了明显的鲜甜。

二是在四川川北地区，尤其是绵阳梓潼县为盛的镶碗，那是用精肉和豆腐剁成茸，加鸡蛋、芡粉后上蒸笼，再依次添加一层蛋黄、一层蛋白。出来是这样的：

而蛋圆子呢，是四川川南地区宜宾一带的代表性食物，在宴席上担任“头碗”，其重要性不言而喻。名叫圆子，其实并不是圆的，而是圆柱体。肉不是打成泥或茸，而且切成筷子或小指头粗细，和鸡蛋、红薯粉、盐、白胡椒、姜末、鸡精等和匀，装裹进蛋皮里，上蒸笼蒸熟。 

以上三道菜，看起来有点像，我相信以中国之大，其他地区还有类似的，欢迎知友们补充。不管是肉糕、镶碗、蛋圆子，不管肉和鸡蛋是什么形式的组合，都是先蒸熟，再搭配其他食材复蒸。黄陂三鲜是鱼圆、肉圆、肉糕，吃的时候蒸十分钟，在用高汤煨着，配木耳、平菇、白菜等，也可以煮火锅、配面条。镶碗则重在吃汤，切好片的肉辅以猪心舌脏片和肥肠、酥肉、响皮、炸豆腐皮、木耳、黄花、粉条、白菜，浇上高汤，蒸锅一开形如宝盖莲花、色泽亮丽，口味清淡馥郁。蛋圆子切片以后，下面垫上蒸熟的荔浦芋头（当地人叫黑秆秆芋）、黄花、木耳、拆骨肉，上面在盖上蛋圆子片，和一块猪油、少许葱末，复蒸10分钟即可。
镶碗和蛋圆子可能都会颠覆外地人对川菜的认知，因为它们跟辣椒一点也不沾边。作为宴席菜，它们都需要制作者在前期准备大量工作，临上桌前复蒸很快，这样可以大大缩短上菜时间，提高出菜效率。
既然是老菜新做，我想从两个方面对宜宾…</span>

NO NO NO! 
是时候放烤箱、电饭煲和空气炸锅这现代厨房三大宝出来一战了！

受 @知乎美食 邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，豆蔻我一眼瞅到知友@DDDDDDD 说想学做烤鸡，嘿哟你可问对人了！
本吃鸡狂魔今天给大家带来了【黄油鸡腿卷】、【彩虹时蔬烤鸡胸】、【盐焗鸡】这3道！聚餐贼有面子的美貌菜！最多不超过3步，就能完成，绝对厨房小白友好~

第一道：奶油鸡腿卷
香香嫩嫩的烤鸡腿好吃是好吃，但是当个正儿八经的菜上桌总是有点过于豪横，所以这次咱换个方式，烤个鸡腿卷！
有菜有肉，吃的时候还不用沾一手油~


食材： 手枪腿 香菇 胡萝卜
调料：盐、黑胡椒、芝士粉、黄油
1、手枪腿去骨，在肉上打上花刀，撒上一层盐和奶酪粉，放上切片的香菇、胡萝卜、小块的黄油

2、然后把鸡腿对折用牙签稍微固定一下

3、再拿根绳子捆紧，表面撒上一层薄薄的盐（盐它可以帮助鸡皮快速脱水，烤出来更加金黄酥脆），送进预热好的空气炸锅，160度烤40分钟（或烤箱180度50分钟）就好了！

成品是这样的！点开大图瞅瞅，看到上面鼓起的小泡泡了咩？这是鸡皮酥脆的好像薯片一样的证据，拿筷子敲敲还咔咔直响！
你要是想吃那可得手脚麻利些，出炉就立刻马上解开绳子，把它扒下来，超过10分钟鸡皮就会回软啦～

但回软不代表味道会变差，切成厚片装盘，蘸着盘底的鸡汁，味道会更好！
看，香菇和胡萝卜被嫩嫩的鸡肉紧紧地裹着，给浓郁的肉香里加入了蔬菜的清甜。鸡肉卷里面汁水特别充盈，只是轻轻捏着就淌的我满手的汤！

黄油和奶酪粉的香气渗入在鸡肉和蔬菜里，我切的时候那个浓郁抹奶香味从里到外的扩散开来，你们不知道我费多大劲才忍住不吃（≧∇≦）

什么？对奶味接受无能？别走别走！还可以试试下面这一道彩虹时蔬烤鸡胸呀～
这道菜是餐桌上大家接受度最高的清新派，蔬菜多，微酸甜！我敢打赌，就算是过年也在减肥的都市丽人…</span>

                    <span>依靠 1988 年的大型机的流程造成了 10 亿英镑的养老金黑洞

英国国家审计署的一份报告发现，ICL 时代遗留下来的大型机是 10 亿英镑的 国家养老金黑洞 的原因之一。英国劳工部所赖以管理数以百万计的养老金领取者记录的基础 IT 系统可以追溯到 1988 年，而且需要大量的手工操作。该部门现有的质量检查未能发现成千上万的养老金领取者的系统性欠费，这些老人因而领不到应得的养老金。这是由于依赖于“自动化程度有限”的系统的流程，并且需要“使用多个系统和解释复杂的规则”。工作人员对升级系统有抵触情绪，因为“从商业角度来看，这样做的过程是非常复杂和非常有风险的。”此外，工作人员还需要访问不同的 IT 系统，并手动将信息从一个系统复制到另一个系统，以计算养老金奖励。


老王点评：如何使 IT 系统也能不断更新换代，这是一个系统性的工程。




SUSE 瞄准后 CentOS 市场，发布 Liberty Linux

SUSE 突然在其网站上宣布了 Liberty Linux，加入了后 CentOS 市场争夺。该产品似乎是 SUSE 对 CentOS 8 的重建，旨在实现接近完美的 RHEL 8 兼容性。目前该发行版还没有可以公开下载的版本，不过除了内核，它的所有 RPM 都构建自红帽官方的源代码 RPM 包。它的内核来自 SUSE 自己的 SLE 企业发行版。有意思的是，SUSE 并没有将 Liberty Linux 描述为一个发行版，而是将其描述为“技术和支持产品”、“一个技术和支持解决方案”，以及“现有 Linux 的技术和支持模式，而不是另一个新的 Linux 发行版”。


老王点评：SUSE 眼馋 CentOS 市场这并不奇怪，但是却将其作为一个服务产品，颇显得扭扭捏捏。




恶意行为者利用供应链攻击在近百款 WordPress 主题和插件中植入后门

AccessPress 是一家 WordPress 插件开发商，其开放的插件和主题在超过 36 万个活跃网站中使用。恶意行为者通过供应链攻击破坏了它的 40 个主题和 53 个插件。这些后门 已经在相当多运行 WordPress 的网站上被发现。但在 WordPress 项目的官方网站上镜像的相同主题和插件仍然是干净的，而直接从 AccessPress 获得的软件的用户在不知情的情况下为攻击者提供了后门权限。这些主题和插件可能已经被植入后门已久。


老王点评：对于这样的供应链攻击，用户有什么办法吗？相信绝大多数的用户没有能力审查代码。</span>

                    <span>为这个自由操作系统的新用户和老用户提供 15 种资源。




在整个上世纪 80 年代和 90 年代，DOS 是桌面之王。世界各地的程序员不满足于 DOS 的专有版本，他们共同创建了一个名为 FreeDOS 的开源版本，该版本于 1994 年首次推出。FreeDOS 项目 在 2021 年及以后还在继续发展。

我们发表了几篇关于 FreeDOS 的文章，以帮助新用户开始使用 FreeDOS 和学习新程序。以下是去年我们最受欢迎的几篇 FreeDOS 文章。

初学 FreeDOS

你是 FreeDOS 的新手吗？如果你想了解如何启动和运行 FreeDOS 的基本知识，请查看这些文章：

如何在 FreeDOS 上归档文件：这是 FreeDOS 版本的 tar，在 DOS 上归档的标准方法是 Zip 和 Unzip。

在 FreeDOS 上使用这个怀旧的文本编辑器：让人联想到 Linux ed(1)，当你想用老式的方法编辑文本时，Edlin 是一种乐趣。


使用 FreeDOS

当你启动进入 FreeDOS，你可以使用这些很棒的工具和应用来完成工作或安装其他软件：


如何使用 FreeDOS 的文本编辑器：FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器，叫做 FreeDOS Edit。

在 FreeDOS 上听音乐：Mplayer 是一个开源的媒体播放器，通常可以在 Linux、Windows、Mac 和 DOS 上找到。

在 FreeDOS 上安装和删除软件包：了解如何使用 FDIMPLES，即 FreeDOS 包管理器，在你的 FreeDOS 系统上安装和删除软件包。

为什么我喜欢用 GW-BASIC 在 FreeDOS 上编程：BASIC 是我进入计算机编程的起点。我已经很多年没有写过 BASIC 代码了，但我对 BASIC 和 GW-BASIC 永远怀有好感。

用 Bywater BASIC 在 FreeDOS 上编程：在你的 FreeDOS 系统上安装 Bywater BASIC，并开始尝试使用 BASIC 编程。


在其近 30 年的历程中，FreeDOS 一直试图成为一个现代 DOS。如果你想了解更多，你可以在 FreeDOS 简史 中阅读关于 FreeDOS 的起源和发展。另外，请看 Don Watkins 关于 FreeDOS 的采访：一个大学生是如何创立一个自由和开源的操作系统。

如果你想尝试 FreeDOS，请下载 2021 年 12 月发布的 FreeDOS 1.3 RC5。这个版本有大量的新变化和改进，包括更新的内核和命令 shell，新的程序和游戏，更好的国际支持，以及网络支持。从 FreeDOS 网站下载 FreeDOS 1.3 RC5。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-14203-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                    <span>System76 分享了其即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板草图。看起来令人惊叹！




System76 令人兴奋的用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的开发工作现在正在进行中。

虽然我们已经用早期的代码 试过了，但我们现在可以看到更多的东西。从其 GitHub 仓库 和 Figma 文档 的一些原型中，我们可以看到它的更多信息。

值得注意的是，我们可以看到顶部面板和系统托盘，正如你在 COSMIC 桌面上所期望的那样。

这仍是一项正在进行的工作，可能会有变化。

COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板

Pop!_OS 依赖于 GNOME 扩展来通过顶部面板或系统托盘图标提供更多的功能。

随着即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面，看起来他们正在创建新的小程序，与当前的外观相融合，并提供更多的功能。

开发者 Eduardo Flores 分解研究 了它，发现了关键的区别以及 System76 的目标是如何使其发挥作用。

而且，这也是它更有趣的地方：


看起来 System76 正在摆脱传统的“扩展”，计划为第三方小程序设计一个 API，这与 KDE、XFce 和其他公司的做法类似。

这是一个令人兴奋的消息，将使 COSMIC 成为一个更强大的桌面环境，使其可以扩展和定制。


另外，似乎这些小程序也可以和顶部面板一起放在坞站里。我们会在其未来的某个测试版中看到更多的实际情况。

在这里，让我重点介绍一下从现有的草图中观察到的基本变化：

1、声音小程序



与我们现在所拥有的相比，COSMIC 的目标是增加细化的控制，如选择输入/输出设备、在顶部面板上切换媒体控制的选项、控制媒体播放，以及访问声音设置。

虽然草图没有显示专辑封面，但在发布前会包括它。

作为参考，以下是 Pop!_OS 顶部面板选项现在的样子。



2、电源小程序



很高兴看到有一个专门的电源按钮来快速访问系统设置、锁屏和注销。

另外，暂停、重启和关机的按钮应该可以提高可用性，关闭计算机不用额外的点击。

3、网络小程序

虽然你可以很容易地打开或关闭有线、无线网络，但会弹出一个占据了整个屏幕的单独窗口来选择 Wi-Fi 网络并输入密码。



但是，看起来我们终于可以在这里输入密码，连接到可用的无线网络，并重试失败的连接，而不必从活动窗口分心。所有这些都发生在系统托盘上的网络小程序上，如上面的截图所示。

同样，你可以看到关于你的有线连接的更多信息，包括 IP 地址和速度。

4、日期、时间和日历小程序



最重要的日历小程序看起来更加实用，信息量更大。通知区不再驻留在这里（它现在有一个单独的小程序），使它的体验更干净，可以把注意力放在你关注的东西上。

一些细微的视觉改进，比如用重点颜色来突出日历中的某一行，应该会使它更容易理解。

5、通知中心



正如我前面提到的，通知现在有一个独立的空间。通知小程序会将所有的通知堆积起来，并允许你在需要时展开它们，或者将它们全部清除。

我们仍然有“请勿打扰”开关，并可以快速访问通知设置。

6、图形模式小程序



这对笔记本电脑用户来说应该是非常有用的，可以在图形模式之间无缝切换，并可以看到当前使用的哪种模式。

除了所有这些，还有一个蓝牙小程序、一个电池电源模式小程序，以及一些其他的东西，比如改变输入语言或输入源的能力。





鉴于这是初次看到使用 Rust 开发 COSMIC 桌面顶部面板的外观，看来我们有很多东西要去看了。

总结

总的来说，System76 正准备为我们提供一个高度可定制但又简化的 COSMIC 桌面版本。

而所有这些都应该有助于形成一种独特的桌面体验。当然，明年你就得在 Pop!_OS 中和 GNOME 说再见了。

你怎么看？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法！

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第6天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
前言
在阅读Kotlin的代码时，经常有看到 :: 这个符号，这个符号专业术语叫做成员引用，在代码中使用可以简化代码，那到底怎么使用呢以及使用的范围，这篇文章就来好好捋一下。
正文
这里虽然很熟悉，但是我们还是从简单说起，需要了解为什么这样设计。
传递函数优化
这里我们举个栗子，就看这个熟悉的sortBy排序函数，先定义People类：
//测试代码
data class People(val name: String,val age: Int){
    //自定义的排序条件
    fun getMax() : Int{
        return age * 10 + name.length
    }
}

然后我们来进行排序：
val people &#x3D; People(&quot;zyh&quot;,10)
val people1 &#x3D; People(&quot;zyh1&quot;,100)
val peopleList &#x3D; arrayListOf(people,people1)
//给sortBy传入lambda
peopleList.sortBy { people -&gt; people.getMax() }

这里我们给sortBy函数传递一个lambda，由于sortBy函数是内联的，所以传递给它的lambda会被内联，但是假如现在有个问题，就是这些lambda已经被定义成了函数变量，比如我定义了一个顶层函数：
//定义了一个顶层函数
fun getMaxSort(people: People): Int{
    return (people.age) * 10 + people.name.length
}

或者排序条件已经定义成了一个变量值：
//排序条件
val cond…</span>

「2022 年什么会火？什么该学？本文正在参与“聊聊 2022 技术趋势”征文活动 」
技术进阶之GC优化
接上一篇文章中讨论过的新技术要具备哪些特点，而良好的性能是新技术“好不好”的一个测量维度，本文主要讨论内存方面的性能，一提到内存大家可能会想到GC，多多少少也会说出一些GC的基础知识，但是很多人对这方面有过的的优化措施却并不是很了解，于是本文讨论一些GC的历史优化，这也是这周在研究的一个技术进阶，好了，该发车了~。
关于GC大多数程序员都只是知道怎么判定垃圾，哪几种回收方式，回收过程这些知识，当然面试官也主要考察的这部分知识。但是我们知其然也要知其所以然，所以笔者从历代GC技术的优化方案来进行讲解，涉及到回收过程中一些细节和改动优化点，从这些优化点当中学到的不只是针对GC的，同样的优化方案在项目中或者在理解更深层次的知识的时候也会起到帮助作用
1.GC Roots遍历提升效率
以往做法
当垃圾回收器线程进行GC时，
第一步需要找到GC Roots；
第二步通过GC Roots进行遍历堆中引用GC Roots的对象形成引用链；
第三步，将不在引用链中的对象标记进行标记（需要回收的对象），或者标记引用链中的对象（需要复制，整理的对象），具体标记哪种对象根据堆中的分代内存不同和采用的垃圾回收算法来确定。
可优化地方以及优化原理
上述过程第二步中遍历堆中引用GC Roots的对象，这部分随着堆内存的越来越大需要的时间也会逐步增长。如果能够提前知道堆中哪部分内存是引用，来判断是否引用GC Roots这样效率是不是会更高一些。
没错，JVM从Exact VM开始就已经采用了准确式内存管理即知道哪部分内存是引用；而且在即时编译的过程中我也会知道栈中或者寄存器里哪部分内存是引用。这个时候我用一个数据结构来存储这些信息，在第二步中就不需要遍历整…</span>

「卡片笔记写作法」用久了，你总会遇到一个问题，就是卡片太多。
这一方面是个效率问题。你要是想把卡片笔记当成严肃的工具，那么底层就得用数据库来组织信息，而非文件系统。Logseq 目前正在做这种迁移。在卡片少的时候，这二者的效率看不出差别，甚至文件组织方式因为直观显得更加友好。但是卡片到了 10 万级别的时候，效率的差别就会显现。效率不达标，随便查找个东西，你都能感受到「卡」。
以我个人的 Roam Research 数据统计为例。虽然「页面」（Page）只有 1 万多，但是别忘了 Roam Research 下的真正卡片单位，是按「块」（block）来计算。

Roam Research 里 Page 的真正含义是什么呢？我觉得是「盒子」，卡片盒嘛。虽不是物理意义上的盒子，有固定形态，但它确实是承载卡片的容器。在 Roam Research 中，如果你的链接都在页面层级，而不是块引用（block reference），那么你其实并没有发挥出它「细粒度」的特性。
效率问题，还只是一个方面。更要命的，是卡片数量庞大之后，你会忘记自己曾经记过某些东西。本文主要讨论的，便是这个恼人的事儿。
最近，「合桃派」团队邀请医学博士 Lan 分享自己的块引用实践。她结合 Cite to write 和 Roam Untangled 两门课程里的方法，利用块引用自底向上构造「问题」，然后用「问题」的块引用来组织论文。她的第一篇综述论文靠着双链笔记工具的加持，超出预期快速写就，且已被录用。 Lan 这种学以致用的精神，很值得钦佩。
讨论环节，我问了她一个问题 —— 若是很久前（一两年前）记录的卡片，内容忘记了怎么办？新的笔记若与之相关，怎么回忆、识别并且链接呢？
Lan 回答，她依靠头脑人工记忆完成链接。
这个回答，很实…</span>

                    <span>突发奇想的想在少数派写这些东西，我也不知道是否会有人喜欢喜爱咖啡，但我一个咖啡从业者希望大家可以慢慢接受咖啡，并且把咖啡和茶放在同一个地位。说的比较大，主要还是想把好喝的咖啡带给大家认识。

今天这篇软文主要是想给大家了解下普通家庭如何入门咖啡～～
首先，你是否喝茶？额，可能有些人会疑惑，喝咖啡为何还会问是否喝茶。但其实茶和咖啡一样，都带有苦涩的成分，如果你能接受喝茶，那喝咖啡就不会有太大问题，两者都属于苦涩甘甜类型。
方便大家理解，这边制图告诉大家。


烘焙程度酸度-MAX5⭐醇度-MAX5⭐
浅度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
中度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
深度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


就和上图标识的一样，烘焙程度取决了咖啡的酸和苦。通过表格其实就很好理解，如果你想喝咖啡，先选好你喜欢什么样的风格。酸？苦？甜？涩？新手入门的话不管是在售卖咖啡的地方还是在连锁咖啡店，都推荐从中度烘焙开始尝试，因为这个阶段有很多种不一样的风味，当你在这个烘焙程度喝习惯后，你可以尝试下浅度烘焙，这会让你感觉不像在喝咖啡，而是想在品一杯果汁。这深度烘焙的话，我建议上意式浓缩就是最好的选择，上面两种烘焙程度建议进行手冲来品尝。
说到冲煮方式，这里前两种烘焙都建议手冲进行，给大家介绍下咖啡的冲煮方式吧～～～
1、滴滤手冲
V60手冲
这是一个V60滤杯的手冲器具，嗯。。。可能大家都想问V60是什么，其实这个名字是按照滤杯的角度命名的，60度刚好是它的角度，V代表了这个形状。这款手冲器具相对来说比较适合新手，简单又可以自我调整也便宜。
————————————可以淘宝这款器具，推荐塑料款————————————
2、法压壶
法压壶
这是一个壶，法式压力壶。法压壶其实也很适合新手，之所以介绍它，是因为它的冲煮方式不一样，它是压力式的，当它浸泡时间一到就可以下压压杆完成冲煮，冲煮方式极其简单方便。

                    <span>10分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
“和危险的动物接触”之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需。
抵达注射点后，可以向分诊台的工作人员咨询具体的注射流程；如果你是晚上去的，也可以找急诊的工作人员咨询。
在接触动物后的 24 小时内是最重要的免疫时间，因此如果第一家注射点受阻，还来得及去第二家注射点，不要着急。
医生会询问你的情况，然后判断是否需要注射狂犬疫苗，如果需要的话，会给你开一张清单，你需要按照这个清单上的时间按时…</span>

手机虚拟机是什么？
手机虚拟机，用过电脑虚拟机的听到应该也不会陌生，其实就是内置在手机本体内的又一个系统。它虽然是模拟真机环境，但与本机系统最大的区别在于：你拥有对该系统的自主掌控权，也就是常说的「自带 root」或者「免 root」，多用于软件测试（包括安装非官方渠道应用）和应用多开。

提到这里，不免要区分下云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机。
云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机的区别
云手机：运行在 ARM 架构（适用于移动通讯领域）的服务器上，性能由服务器决定，用户需要通过远程访问云手机操控，不影响本机系统，但也存在网络延迟现象。
Android 模拟器：其实与手机虚拟机类似。Android 模拟器运行在电脑端，需要通过键盘鼠标来操控。对于习惯手游的用户来说，除特殊需求，使用频率并不算高。
手机虚拟机：运行在手机内，占用手机内存和运算能力，因而手机性能的高地直接决定了虚拟机的运行流畅度，优势是共享真机网络。
三者各有优势，加上成本因素（包括金钱和操作）来考量的话，倾向使用手机虚拟机的人越来越多。毕竟对于生活玩家来说，一台手机上就能免费完成应用多开、软件测试的需求，何乐而不为。
常见的手机虚拟机有哪些，优缺点是什么？
真机性能越好，虚拟机运行才会越流畅，类比在手机里运行的游戏应用。这几年各大手机厂商都在疯狂给手机加配置，又正是洞察到了我们的需求。
市场上主流的三款虚拟机也都一一使用过一段时间（仅以酷安上的数据为参照）。

VMOS Pro、光速和 51 虚拟机，三者其实大同小异，最受欢迎的多开，悬浮窗，挂机等…</span>

                    <span>终端是很多人日常打交道的工具之一。比如，深度学习是目前一个大热的研究课题，由于训练和推理过程需要强大的 GPU，研究生们共享 GPU 服务器，并通过终端使用 SSH 连接并编写代码。而公司中的运维人员，也需要通过 SSH 进行远程访问服务器，对系统或服务进行维护。
在日常操作中，最大的问题就是如何优雅地从远程主机中复制文本并粘贴到本机中。
问题：跨平台系统剪贴板不通
远程主机一般我们不能直接通过显示器和键盘控制，也没有图形界面，所有的操作都需要通过 SSH 访问并在终端操作。
而本机和远程主机都各自有自己的一套剪切板，在命令操作中复制的文本只会保存在远程主机的剪贴板中。那我们通过终端的图形界面选择并复制不可以吗？

上图是一个非常日常的场景，我们需要从一个配置文件里复制一行或是多行的代码，这里我们选择的工具是 VIM。但我们真的开始复制时就会遇到如下的困难：

困难一：如果只想要复制正文，那么左侧的代码行号也不得不被选择。尽管这个可以通过绑定快捷键快速开关行号。
困难二：细心观察，图中文本的第三行超过了终端的宽度，自动换行到下一行展示。如果同时选择这两行，粘贴出来的效果也会是两行而不是它本该的一行。
困难三：整份文档并不只有 24 行，如果想要复制整份文档，则不得不分几次逐次选择并复制全终端屏幕。

而这些情况也的确困扰了我很久。
解决方案：OSC codes
OSC 代表的是 Operating System Controls, 是一种约定俗成的用于终端程序中的逃逸序列表达，终端会根据 OSC codes 所定义的行文处理方式处理它所包围的文本。
而正巧的是就有一种定义决定了「如何从终端中复制内容到系统剪贴板中」，那就是 OSC 52 escape sequence。
OSC 52 一次最长接受 100000 个字节，其中前 7 个字节为 &quot;\033]52;c;&quot;，中间 …</span>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

前言
收到我人生最大的一笔单篇稿费的这天晚上，我失眠了。
当然不是因为钱多烧的，而是白天咖啡喝多了 2021 年最后一篇稿子赚来的稿酬成功让我回想起了成为少数派作者的这一年。
我是 Leslie，一个致力于让没有医学背景的人听懂医生在说啥的科普作者，一年以前，我还只是一个潜水的小透明，现在却混进了少数派的作者群。不过和作者群里两百多个大佬不一样，我不太厉害。在「高效工作」领域，我是个吊车尾，不会编程，不会拆电脑修手机，不会摄影，不会录播客，不会剪视频；在「品质生活」方面，我不会马伽术，不会做厉害的咖啡或是诱人的饭菜，不会种菜，不会俄语，没有惊人的读书量和阅片量，去过的地方也很少。在以上知识技能和经历方面相信很多读者都可以来无情地碾压我。而且我还是个内向的「社恐」。
但你既然已经读到了这篇文章，说明我对这个社区还是有一点点价值的。一直以来我写的多是具体的医学健康话题，这次，我想讲点柔软的，讲讲在成为了少数派作者的这一年，我这样的普通人在坚持写作之后，在网络上终于开始 reach out 之后，有了什么样的改变和思考。希望可以鼓励到和我有着类似渴望或相同困境的读者。
在关系中成长——和编辑的故事
正如《也许你该找个人聊聊》的作者所说，人和人是在关系中成长的。
我向来习惯在现实生活和社交网络中对陌生人保持缄默，而在少数派上写稿、加入作者群，让我产生了新的和人的联结，我认识了好多编辑，有的勇敢，有的善良，有的很宽容，有的很硬汉。在这样的交流中我除了交了十几篇稿…</span>

👋 Hey there!
It is great to be back from my Winter Break. It has only been six weeks but much has happened… 
We had a wonderful holiday season and I hope you all did as well. After capping off the season of merriment and singing Auld Lang Syne it was time for a big birthday for me. Jamie v5.0.0 arrived on January 3rd and my family arranged a tremendous day. I also noted a couple of thoughts.
We all took the day off and had fun presenting, hiking, and escaping! I even got my very own song, the Big 5 O! You can listen on Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. 🤘 I mean, how cool is that! 🤩

本周话题：前端与后端，谁更难？
&quot;黑客新闻&quot;（Hacker News）是美国最大的程序员社区，我每天都看，周刊的很多内容就来自那里。

有一天，我看到一个帖子。
一个前端程序员说，他不想干前端了，咨询大家意见，转到后端是否可行。
我从2007年开始从事前端开发，到了现在，很多新技术已经不擅长了。每次打开 Chrome 开发者工具，看到那些我不知道的新功能，我总是选择忽略。
很多我熟悉的工具和功能，都已经或将被弃用。现在的前端开发都在 npm 环境，经常有难懂的报错，好不容易搜到答案，又要花很多时间修复本地开发环境。
即使那些最简单的任务，现在的开发方式也比以前复杂，要考虑很多边界场景。我能够完成的工作，不断得缩小。
我失去了继续在前端工作的信心，转到后端，会不会容易一些。
简单说就是，他觉得前端越来越难，自己跟不上，无法坚持下去了。他想知道，后端会不会更容易一些，转成后端开发是否可行？

可以想象，讨论这种问题，一定是众说纷纭。
原帖下面，各种意见都有。支持的一方说，前端现在确实变得非常复杂，技术工具的更新速度太快，开发和维护的难度超过了后端。
反对的一方说，后端也很难，如果你适应不了 Node.js，改行写 C++/Java/Go 也会很痛苦，千万不要草率做决定。

难易是主观感受，没有办法精确衡量，人与人之间不可比较。所以我觉得，讨…</span>

Java is often hated for various reasons one of them is being too verbose.

However it&#x27;s a great language that&#x27;s continuously evolving and it&#x27;s an absolute king of enterprise software, for the good or the bad. One of its ...</span>

                    <span>KDE 开始 15 分钟错误消除计划

该计划用于集中修复许多影响 KDE 桌面的低级错误，这些错误用户在 15 分钟或更短时间内就能发现。其列入标准是，这些错误受 KDE 的默认设置影响，100% 可重现，一些基本的东西不工作或看起来有视觉上的缺陷，可能导致崩溃，需要重启或终端命令来解决或没有解决方法，最近回退的错误，或有超过五个重复的错误报告。在该计划中，第一批 有 56 个错误需要处理。


老王点评：这些不起眼而很重要的工作，才真正能将 KDE 打磨成主流桌面环境。




Opera 发布专门的内置加密钱包的浏览器

Opera 发布 了一个 Web3 Crypto 浏览器，内置加密货币钱包，更易于访问加密货币/NFT 交易所、去中心化应用 dApp 等。Opera 表示新浏览器旨在简化 Web3 用户体验。Web3 是基于区块链的去中心化互联网，是目前加密货币支持者最热衷的新事物。该浏览器的钱包支持包括以太坊、比特币等加密货币。不过，该浏览器在国内被禁止使用。


老王点评：虽然 Opera 逐渐从主流浏览器中落后，但是它专注于游戏、加密货币等领域的努力还是值得赞赏。




因 5G 干扰，国际航空公司正在减少飞往美国的航班

美国的移动电话公司正在推出的 5G 服务，使用频率在 3.7 至 3.98GHz 之间的无线电频谱，即所谓的 C 波段。国际航空业担心美国 5G 服务过于接近雷达高度计使用的频谱，也就是 4.2 至 4.4GHz 之间，因而正在减少飞往美国的航班。但国际航空业认为，欧洲没有面临同样的风险，在欧洲，5G 服务使用频率较慢的 3.4 至 3.8GHz 范围的频谱，和雷达高度仪使用的频谱之间有更大的缓冲区。此外，欧洲也限制了机场附近的 5G 天线的功率和角度，避免了对飞机的干扰。

                    <span>POSIX，你肯定在各种在线论坛和文章中，听到过这个缩写，或读到过关于它的信息。程序员和系统开发人员似乎最关心这个问题。它听起来很神秘，虽然有很多关于这个主题的好资料，但一些讨论区（简洁是它们的特点）并没有详细说明它是什么，这可能会让人困扰。那么，POSIX 到底是什么？



POSIX 简介

与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。

当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&amp;T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。

该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。

为什么有 POSIX？

一句话：可移植性。

60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。

IBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。

不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…</span>

Created by Adam Le Doux in 2017 and released under an MIT license, Bitsy is, in the words of its creator: &quot;A little editor for little games or worlds. The goal is to make it easy to make games where you can walk around, talk to people, and be somewhere.&quot;

Go has had built-in support for testing for quite some time now. It makes writing tests and running them using the Go tool relatively easy.

                    <span>这几天美国海军终于推出了自己六代机项目，F/A-XX战斗机的概念演示视频，这也宣告了美国海军舰载机部队在还未完全换装F-35C隐身舰载机的情况下，已经打算用F/A-XX战斗机逐步取代F-35C隐身舰载机。原因很有可能是因为某大国海五代现身，和整体军事实力的提升，让漂亮国也不得不加速研发力度，甚至一改往日引领者的角色，摸着兔子过河也未尝不是一种捷径！而原先的F35的舰载机为收回成本，责大范围出口盟友，尤其是亚太国家，所以F-35隐身舰载机在未来很长一段时间内将成为，我国“海五代”的最大对手。在面对未来战场的

文案6000余字，剪成两个视频是比较合适的，但是up比较讨厌话说一半，就干脆都放出来了，嫌长的同志可以按照兴趣从不同点，后遗症或者人类之光几个部分里自己选择。如果依旧觉得一次性太长的话，一定要和我说哦，下次再写比较长的文案，up就把它分开发~
快过年了，小伙伴们都要假期学知识哦!

如果您觉得视频多少有一点点的帮助的话，别忘了帮up留个三连~！

                    <span>诗词缘起
有的人特别爱吹牛，有的人不喜欢吹牛。
我以前属于前者，但现在是后者。
因为我遇到了一个对的人，我不想骗她。
从爱上她，到现在，直至往后余生，我都在为向她吹的最后一个牛还债。
那个牛皮是这样吹的：

宋词很简单，如果你做我女朋友，以后每个七夕节，我都给你写一首！

没想到，后来我俩真的在一起了，看样子这辈子也会一直在一起。
没办法，为了维持“守信”“才华”人设不塌房，我每年都会强迫自己在七夕节前一两个月切换角色，假装诗人。

10年前还在用手写

2021年已经用app生成了
假装诗人三板斧
不知不觉牛皮吹过了10年，我也写完了10首宋词，说实话很有成就感，但也挺累人的。
因为一个脑袋空空的当代俗人，想要冒充古代文豪不穿帮，需要用很多工具，才能催眠自己“我觉得我挺行”，来维持自己的诗词创作之路：
诗词典籍：假装自己满腹经纶。 用来经常翻阅七夕相关的诗词名作，培养语感。常用工具有宋词三百首、诗经等书籍、以及古诗词典等诗词软件。
词谱韵表：假装自己精通韵律。 用来选择词牌，查找词谱，对应平仄。常用工具有白香词谱、平水韵、中华新韵等书籍和对应软件。
记录创作：假装自己落笔成诗。 用来灵感收集，细化修改。常用工具有纸笔以及word、印象笔记等软件。
迭代：写拉松诗词创作系统
在这十年间，我的创作流程逐渐稳定，但工具层面却常起波澜。一些纸质书籍内容被移动APP替代，也有一批软件逐渐停止维护，一直期待要是有一套自己的诗词创作系统就好了。
今年我福至心灵，在写拉松上试着搭建自己的创作系统，发现竟然非常顺畅，基本能覆盖80%的功能。并且因为这套系统可以在手机上随时执行，对碎片时间的利用率非常高，所以大大缩短了我的创作周期，非常赞。
写拉松是啥？

@潘誉晗：45 路公交车在十字路口爆炸，强烈的火光不仅打破了一日的宁静，也带走了许多人的生命。女大学生李诗情和游戏设计师肖鹤云却从这场爆炸中复活，两人一次次经历爆炸，一次次「死而复生」，却也一次次「开局重来」进入了循环……
这部由正午阳光出品，腾讯独播的开年网剧真的「炸」了，虽然同类型的作品早有《土拨鼠之日》《源代码》和《明日边缘》珠玉在前，可毕竟这是国内第一部循环向的剧集，所以总归有一些带着担忧的期待，但一口气看完八集的感觉很好。而本剧又是以 2013 年的厦门公交爆炸案为原型，所以…</span>

                    <span>一年又一年，Apple 在今天发布了由 iPhone 13 Pro 拍摄的虎年新春影片《卷土重来》，这部影片是 Apple 发布的第五支新春影片，也是与过去四部影片完全不同的一部作品。

首先是时长，《卷土重来》的片长有 23 分钟之久，与之相比，2018 年发布的首支 Apple 新春影片《三分钟》的片长为 7 分钟、去年发布的《阿年》为 12 分钟。其次是类型元素，与过去人物关系、道具场景都相对简单的四部影片不同，我们在《卷土重来》中可以看到传统武打、好莱坞科幻、乡土情怀、幽默喜剧、父子亲情等多种电影风格类型，道具和场景方面包含了机器人和机器狗、全地形车、火星基地、飞船模型等等，制作规模进一步突破。
《卷土重来》讲述的是电影梦碎的儿子，跟一个异想天开的父亲，为了把无人问津的村子打造成网红景点，率领一众村民拍摄火星大电影的故事。身为替身武打演员的儿子，在一次拍摄中不慎受伤之后无奈回村，接受了电影梦破灭现实的他，希望利用多年积攒下来的积蓄，将父亲接去城市生活，告别土地贫瘠、生活环境恶劣的乡村。父亲则希望为乡村拍摄一部影片，希望通过这部影片将乡村走出困境，同时也帮助儿子圆一次电影梦。
影片从父子之间的矛盾作为展开，儿子希望带领父亲逃离「除了沙尘一无所有，荒凉得跟个火星似的」乡村，前往城市生活；父亲则从儿子的话语中收获了不一样的理解：那就拍一部关于「火星」的电影。这里展现的，不仅是现实中父母与子女常有的矛盾冲突，也代表了两代人对于困难、梦想的不一样的看法：20 岁的儿子虽然怀揣电影梦，但是遇到困难就决定接受现实、放弃梦想；60 岁的父亲却对梦想执着追求，不仅希望帮助儿子圆一次电影梦，也对于生活了一辈子的乡村仍抱有希望，对于村民抱有希望。

影片背后留下的不少线索，也埋藏了对于现代生活的各种还原。比如父亲希望拍摄视频放到网上，将村子打造成网红景点，正是当下短视频时代的一种社会缩影…</span>

                    <span>不论身在何处，华人最重要的节日无疑是春节。除夕之夜全家团圆，共同迎接新年的到来。
不过，除夕当日除了准备年夜饭之外，另一项重要的活动就是大扫除。最初是一种祛除病疫的宗教仪式，后来慢慢发展成了必不可少的习俗，被视作是在新年里远离秽气、晦气和穷气的象征。

即使对这样的传统及其附带的意义并不感兴趣，每隔一段时间的大扫除也是十分必要的。对频繁搬家的人来说，至少还可以趁着收拾行李的机会整理、清洁；但如果常年住在同一间房子里，被挡住的卫生死角很容易就被忽视，经年累月下来灰尘和病菌聚集，对居住者的身体健康也会造成一定影响。甚至可以趁着大扫除的时候，对家中物品做个清点，在旧年「断舍离」掉不常用的东西，给家里腾出更多的空间。
接下来将介绍我在大扫除时的一些基本思路，以及一些（希望是）具体可行的操作方法。与上一篇日常家务的文章不同的是，本篇中的清洁会更细致，所需时间更长，体力消耗更大，并且可能需要迁延多日才能完成。

需要注意的是每个人的房间格局、装修材料、家具设施、使用习惯、清洁要求，以及所在地的气候、习俗、家中人口各有不同，也就带来了清洁方式的差异，请根据自身情况适配。另外，由于笔者近几年来都在国外居住，对国产的家务神器缺乏认知，用的基本上都是最基础的器具，也没有钱买扫地机器人和新风这种所需不菲的设备……如果各位在阅读过程中发现有些问题可以用某种神器替代，也欢迎在评论区喂我安利。（如果直接空投我一个扫地机器人的话也可以！谢谢老板！）
如果以上都可以接受的话，那我们就开始吧！
前置准备
大扫除在所有家务活里并不能算轻松。如果能够提前准备的话，就能减少很多在扫除过程中的困扰。
在这里，「提前准备」包含了两重含义。

                    <span>开始这篇文章之前，先说说这两天我在清理电脑存储上的一个插曲。
有着良好电脑使用习惯的我，直到上一次打开 Mac 的储存空间界面，还始终保持着预留至少 50G 的空间来避免可用存储空间过少造成的「心理健康」问题，直到某天清理电脑无用软件时，突然发现电脑只剩 20G 可用，就在那一瞬间，我觉得我与存储空间的多年战斗宣告完败。
一番排查过后，最占用存储空间的是不出意外的微信和企业微信两大「巨头」，足足有 60G 的空间消耗。这些聊天记录的缓存，在电脑端占用的空间寸土寸金，却不让我十分珍惜，因为他们杂乱无章，脱离了微信就再也无法访问，偶尔同步最近记录还会抽风，语音同步也是个老大难问题，想要全量的聊天记录检索，必须搬出已经占用 10G 的手机微信。
想到前一阵子微信拟推出付费的聊天记录云端存储功能，以及越来越大的微信存储占用，我开始未雨绸缪，考虑谨慎处理我已经愈渐庞大和失控的微信数据。
定期的全量备份以建立保障
微信自带的备份和迁移
因为一直是 iPhone 用户，所以能够采取的备份方案一般也以官方的为主。下图这两个界面应该所有人都不陌生，电脑端提供的一直都是备份和恢复的操作，而如果是换手机的场景，也支持将设备连接到同一 WiFi，直接在手机间迁移聊天记录。这两个方案都能解决问题，但如果聊天记录过多的话，同步速度会不太可控。

说到手机间迁移聊天记录的场景，ColorOS、MIUI 等国内 Android 系统基本都支持微信数据的云端同步功能，部分 Android 系统还支持选择性恢复聊天记录，不仅对于聊天记录的留存多一份保障，还让随时可能过期的临时文件得以自动地存储下来。
相比而言，iOS 虽然也具备机器间数据整体的迁移功能，不过前提是需要借助电脑或 iCloud 云端同步来实现。需要说明的是，iCloud 的备份是对于 iOS 本地文件的「一锅端」，相比微信自带备份功能的缺点是只…</span>

说的就是这位 @东北少女vivian 同学：
可以复刻薛记炒货的网红爆款酸奶柑橘片吗？这玩意100多一斤就那么点…
网上几乎没有可用的方子！
受 @知乎美食  邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，让大家在问题下许愿，一眼我就看到了这个心愿，“酸奶柑橘片”这玩意最近风很大啊不是么？！
其实我早就听说过了，但是我不爱吃桔子就一直没下手，直到看到这个心愿，没忍住剁了下手。
就，妙啊。
柑橘还是那个貌不惊人的柑橘，白巧还是那个甜死人毫不愧疚的白巧，两人一组合，就成了网红零食了，关键是，这网红零食它好吃————
也好贵。

如果说去年过年的年度DIY零食新贵是奶枣，那今年盲猜就是这个了。因为它实在优势太明显：
正好赶上柑橘上市季节、价格便宜、步骤简单、酸甜适口、耐存放、老少咸宜。
于是就决定做这个给你们看了！
嘘，别问原因，问就是家里收了3箱子朋友从各地寄来的桔子、橙子等，我实在消耗不完了（此处感谢 @陈大可 等人提供的原料）。

但是由于对网上教程的极度不信任，我还是用分组法，在不同的步骤试验了很多种方法去制作，旨在让你们看完我这一篇絮絮叨叨的回答就都会做。

所以以下，除了正常的“烘烤柑橘片——融化巧克力——裹巧克力涂层——冷却”这4个谁都能看明白的步骤外，我会在每一个步骤都列出来你可能失败的原因，包括但不仅限于：

1、柑橘的选择——决定成品造型和是否发苦
2、烤箱、果脯机、空气炸锅、电暖气哪家强——决定果干烘烤时间和成色
3、巧克力的选择和配料——决定色泽、脆度和味道平衡
4、冷却时间和注意事项——决定保存时间和口感保持

看到这里，你就已经知道我翻车了多少回才有信心写下这个教程了。

那么，“我去买几个橘子，你就站在此地，不要走动。”[1]

A、车辆的准备


1、轮胎和制动系统
轮胎是汽车唯一与地面接触的零部件，其重要性不言而喻。首先，我们需要保证轮胎胎壁没有鼓包，因为鼓包会直接导致爆胎，车辆会失控。其次，我们要确认轮胎没有过度磨损，如果都快成光头胎了，还是赶紧换掉吧，快过年了，汽修店的人都快手关门回老家啦。再者，我们需要一套胎压监测，这比每次都下车踢一脚轮胎来得靠谱。
出发之前，我们必须到4S店或汽修店检查一下制动系统是否运作正常，刹车片是否已经磨到底了，制动液是否该换了。
.
2、三大件
如果真的要跑很久的长途，不妨提早做一个小保养，换换油水，检查刹车，顺便让4S店或者快修店师傅给你检查一下发动机、变速箱、底盘“三大件”是否性能完备。
谁都不想车子在前不着村后不着店的地方抛锚，这还是春节期间呢，谁来拯救你？钱给够当然有救援，但没人想多花两三倍的钱对吧。

                    <span>哦，这个是我的领域。我暂且认为，我在这个领域，全国范围能排前100问题不大。知乎比我专业的人，应该不会超过10个（我抛砖引玉，其他曾经同行，你们自己看情况）。
我做的是变速箱标定，是某国际大厂，认定的中国区域，仅有的2个驾驶性评估工程师（另外一位是我徒弟）。带我的师傅，是国内某厂混动方案起草人。我一度考虑找自主品牌融资，创业搞变速箱，后来发现自己落后了 ，于是就不搞了，改行了。
通俗的讲，主要解决2个问题， 换挡点+换挡质量。
首先你说的硬件问题， 是很难创新的，ZF的8AT，奇瑞的CVT，爱信6AT，Getrag的7dct也好，他们是设计好变速箱，就疯狂卖，一般6000-15000块一台，价格关键看扭矩，看你采购量。硬件的每个档位的传动比，基本结构，都不会改动了 ，最多改变下和发动机 链接处，就是表面功夫，密封更好这些。主要调整的是软件。
1）先解决有无问题：换挡点
这块需要根据每个发动机来，发动机的万有特性（就是扭矩、转速、油门开度。功率用的其实是很少）
这里面决定了油耗，动力性， 当然你可以设置几套模式，什么雪地模式（2挡起步），运动模式（推迟换挡点），经济模式（早换挡），内部还会存在爬坡等。当然不同厂家逻辑是不一样的，有的是一套图谱，根据运动，经济等修正，有的可能是几套。
但是，这些本质都是有无问题 ，客户根本不关心，车评人也不关心。
要关心的是：换挡质量（从有到优）
2：换挡质量：聪明、迅捷、平顺
最好的换挡，就要像电车那样，客户感知不到，在所有评估里，这个都是10分，因为那是真正的车随脚动，油车即使保时捷帕拉梅拉，也给不了10分。
传统油车有如下几种问题
   2.1：换挡时间问题
    DCT一般最短200毫秒左右，长的话1.5s也是存在的（我们还做过一个2.3s的车）。
你想想，1.5S你怎么接受？一脚下去，1.5S之后车才动
为什么会存在1.5s？因为驾…</span>

一、概述
1.1 描述
上文介绍到了SQLite Api，今天咱们介绍一下 Room ( Android Jetpack 重要成员之一 )。
Room 持久性库在 SQLite 之上提供了一个抽象层，以允许流畅的数据库访问，同时利用 SQLite 的全部功能。特别是，Room 提供以下好处：
SQL 查询的编译时验证。
方便的注释，最大限度地减少重复和容易出错的样板代码。
简化的数据库迁移路径。
由于这些考虑，我们强烈建议您使用 Room 而不是直接使用 SQLite API。
1.2 主要部件
Room 包含三个主要组件：
保存数据库并用作与应用程序持久数据的底层连接的主要访问点的数据库类。
表示应用数据库中表的数据实体。
数据访问对象(DAO)，提供你的应用可用于在数据库中查询、更新、插入和删除数据的方法。
数据库类为您的应用程序提供与该数据库关联的 DAO 实例。反过来，应用程序可以使用 DAO 从数据库中检索数据作为关联数据实体对象的实例。该应用程序还可以使用定义的数据实体来更新相应表中的行，或创建新行以进行插入。下图说明了 Room 不同组件之间的关系。

二、创建 Room
2.1 添加依赖项
在 app/build.gradle文件中添加依赖：
dependencies {
    //Room
    def room_version &#x3D; &quot;2.4.1&quot;
    implementation &quot;androidx.room:room-runtime:$room_version&quot;

                    <span>0 写在最前面
2021年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔1-2年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在16至25岁间萌出，此时人的生理、心理发育都接近成熟，有“智慧到来”的象征，因此被俗称为“智齿”。智齿生长方面，个体有很大差异，通常情况下应该有上下左右对称的4颗牙，有的少于4颗甚至没有，极少数人会多于4颗。萌出的年龄差异也很大，有的人20岁之前萌出，有人40到50岁才长或者终生不长，这都是正常现象。1

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/71062">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>什么是自定义短语
macOS 与 iOS 中的键盘设置中，都有 【自定义短语】这个功能。
这个功能有什么用呢，可以很方便的输入平时常用的一些词条，比如你的住址，或邮箱。
该功能是这样的，定义一个输入码比如 mail 定义它的替换文本为 kylebingbing@163.com，这样，在你输入 mail 的时候就会被自动替换成你的邮箱。
macOS 中是这样的
 

iOS 中是这样的
 

macOS 与 iOS 的键盘中的自定义短语是同步的。所以在 macOS 上导入的短语也会出现在同账号下的 iOS 系统中。
我的需求
我是五笔用户，iOS上用的是原生的五笔输入法，但这个输入法有个问题，就是词库无法自定义，所以我就瞄准了输入法中的这个 【自定义短语】功能。我需要往里导入非常多的词几百几千或几万，一个一个加是不可能了。
上面我们已经知道 macOS 与 iOS 的自定义短语是同步的，所以只需要在 macOS 上导入词条就可以了，幸运的是 macOS 是可以批量导入的。
一、自定义短语的位置
macOS

打开键盘设置
切换标签到 自定义短语
往里面添加就可以了

iOS

打开设置
打开 【通用设置】
找到【键盘】
再点击【自定义短语】

二、如何导入导出词条
批量导入导出词条只能在 macOS 中操作
1. 导出

打开自定义短语的窗口
command + a 选中所有词条，
然后拖动这些词条到桌面，即可导出词条到桌面，此时会生成一个 .plist 的文件，其文件的内容格式如下






phrase
kylebing@163.com
shortcut
mail


phrase
自定义短语
shortcut
tpyy




观察这个文件结构可以看到它是由 phrase 和 shortcut 两个字段组成的。
2. 导入
你可以上面的文件结构生成自己的 .plist 文件。
导入的方法跟导出正好相反，直接拖动 .plist 文件到 自定义短语的窗口中即可，系统还会自动查重。
三、批量处理词条的工具
工具地址：
 
 
介绍一下我做的一个可以批量处理词条的工具。它可以将批量词条生成到一个 plist 文件中，直接拖动导入到自定义短语中就可以了。
比如我有这些词条需要导入，目前只有 编码-短语 这种结构，需要生成 .plist 那种 xml 结构

只需要选中需要导入的词条，点击 【导出为 .plist 文件】即可

只需要拖动生成的文件到自定义短语的窗口中，即可完成批量导入

                    <span>李想最近在微博上很活跃。
2022 年 1 月 11 日的下午，李想在理想汽车内部一个主动安全主题的飞书群看到了一个懂车帝的视频链接，视频的标题很长：「2021 年度新能源、AEB、性能车型及发动机评选」，但对于李想来说，题眼无非是 3 个字母：AEB。
AEB，全称 Autonomous Emergency Braking，自动紧急制动系统。在车辆行驶的过程中，如果有追尾的风险，但驾驶员又没踩刹车亦或是踩了但力度不够，都会触发 AEB，大力制动以避免追尾。
在刚刚过去的 2021 年，懂车帝测试了超过 100 款车的 AEB，测试的项目纷繁复杂，既有儿童鬼探头、隧道 AEB，也有消失的前车、50% 追尾，这些测试远远超出了全球各国的碰撞安全评测机构布置的「考题」，以更加贴合中国交通场景的测试对 AEB 进行极限考验。
那支视频的结论是：2021 款理想 ONE 打败了进入前五的华晨宝马 5 系、华晨宝马 X3、斯巴鲁傲虎和沃尔沃 XC60，成为懂车帝 2021 年 AEB 测试表现最好的车型。
几个小时后，李想发微博表达了对智能驾驶团队的认可：「自从能够开展全栈自研以后，团队在算法和控制的进步速度远远超过了我的想象」。
对于李想，乃至理想汽车这家公司来说，这无疑是一场小小的胜仗。尤其是考虑到就在一年前的 2020 年 12 月底，理想才和视觉感知供应商 Mobileye 分手，站在一穷二白从头来的白纸前。
为什么是理想？
一切都要回到一年前的那个年底。和 Mobileye 一年多来的合作已经让理想「忍无可忍」：这家从以色列起步的视觉感知供应商以其高效、可靠的算法敲开了诸多主流汽车制造商的大门，其中也包括年轻的理想汽车，但因为其高度封闭的合作策略，理想汽车在收集到用户端反馈的一些 Bug 后，却不被允许基于 Mobileye 的算法基础进行持续的迭代开发，以修复这些 Bug…</span>

                    <span>前言 | 正经人就该写日记
有个老梗：“正经人谁写日记？下贱！”
虽然是句调侃，但确实让不少人对写日记这件事情生畏和误解。生畏，是把写日记当成羞耻，生怕被人发现；误解，是以为写日记就是自我内心世界的描绘，和不可告人的秘密。
其实，凡是喜欢写所谓“走心” 日记的，往往是三天打鱼两天晒网的人。能让你坚持写一生的日记，一定不是靠情绪和修辞构建出来的，而是由事件组成的。
真正的日记，写的不是瞬息万变的情绪，也不是无病呻吟的自虐剖析，而是忠实记录某个时间，发生了某件与己相关的事，仅此而已。
所以，只有不正经的人才羞于将自己的经历记录下来，咱正经人，写个日记，堂堂正正，坦坦荡荡，有什么可害臊的呢？

所谓日记，一言以蔽之，就是按照时间顺序所书写的个人经历记录，就是与时间不同的“自己”这个“别人”进行的笔谈
——《智识的生产技术》，梅棹忠夫

接下来，咱们进入正题，讲3件事：

为什么要写日记？
为什么要用writeathon写日记？

一 | 为什么要写日记？
季羡林日记
如果用一个形象的比喻，来揭示日记与记录者的关系的话，可以这样认为：

日记是一座个人的档案馆。

为什么这么说呢？
人的记忆是非常不可靠的，它既疯狂遗忘，又肆意拼凑。如果我们在事件发生时，不留下实体的信息，仅仅靠自己的记忆来形成对真实世界的印象，无疑将是变形和残缺的。
而通过写日记，将我们在线性时间旅程中的经历，变成不同时间节点的信息沉淀下来，就构建了我们的个人档案馆，是对人生的真实备份。
我们通过一张张的时间切片，不仅可以看到结果，还能追溯其真实发生的过程，从而获得更多对未来的启发。
如果说三维世界是高维世界的投影，那么日记就是我们三维人所能掌握的一种对高维世界的透视技巧。
通过日记建立个人档案馆，我们可以在一定程度上摆脱三…</span>

                    <span>“您平时身体好吗？”“身体好的很，从来没生过病。”“您这牙之前疼过吗？”“疼过。”“那这不是生过病吗？”“这可算不上病吧。”“您可别小看这牙痛，您现在这问题就是牙痛没有及时处理导致的，需要手术治疗了。”“这么严重啊。”“那可不，可别不把牙痛不当病啊。”

这样的对话，在如今的口腔门诊上，屡见不鲜。随着社会发展、物质富足，人们糖摄取量明显增多，食物越来越精细，生活压力越来越大，相应的，口腔问题（包括但远不仅限于牙痛）也如影随形。然而，好好刷牙并非包治百病，贵的牙膏并不会比便宜的牙膏有更好的效果，口腔卫生知识的缺失，让很多人忽视本该处理的口腔问题，错过最佳的治疗机会，延误病情，带来更为严重的后果。这篇文章中，我希望能够通过简单易懂的方式，一次性给你说清楚看牙这个问题。
口腔医生究竟能看哪些疾病？
每种医生都有自己的管辖范围，这个范围在各国之间可能都存在差异。去到医院，看到“琳琅满目”的科室和医生列表，你是否也曾疑惑过，我究竟应该挂哪个科？
中国的口腔医生，可不只会看牙。
在中国，口腔医生这个职业，和美国的 dentist（A dentist is a person who is qualified to examine and treat people&#x27;s teeth.）是有明显区别的，这个区别具体就体现在诊疗范围上。现代中国口腔医学的体系，脱胎于前苏联，除了dentist涉及的范围（主要就是口腔及牙齿）外，还包括口腔颌面外科的内容。也就是说，口腔医生中，有一类是外科医生，也就是大家眼里那种会上手术台，会拿手术刀的医生。
大半个头都归口腔医生管。
头，这样一个全身最为精密的部位，医学上也分工明确。有头发覆盖的区域（颅骨+大脑），归神经外科管辖，但注意，请不要使用现有的发量去进行判断，这可能会导致不准确的结论，同时头发和头皮的问题，可能需要咨询皮肤科的医生（我不说是什么问题）。眼…</span>

                    <span>前序
在第一篇「复制清单」文章发布后，我收到很多用户的留言和建议，大部分人都希望清单能支持连续复杂粘贴。
由于iOS系统有很多安全限制，应用只能读取当前复制的内容，无法在后台连续读取剪切板。不过，方法总比困难多，在我翻阅了大量文档和资料后，「复制清单」终于成功支持后台连续复制粘贴。
非常激动地告诉大家: iOS也有像安卓一样，可以实时保存复制内容的剪切板应用了！
开启后台剪切板

打开应用选择右边剪切板工作栏，点击「开启后台剪切板」。

 
2. 点击开启后台剪切板后，顶部会出现一个悬浮条显示「等待复制」，它会实时显示你复制的内容，右滑可将它最小化。点击悬浮框左上角的「✖️』可关闭后台复制功能。

 
 
3. 切换到其他的应用复制文本，应用会实时读取剪切板，并保存文本到应用。应用将按顺序批量保存剪切板内容， 点右边的小箭头可最大化悬浮框。

 
 
 
4. 切换到清单键盘，选择第一个&#x27;剪切板&#x27;分类，在这个分类可以看到刚批量复制的文本，点击就可以输入。

 
 
5.  如果剪切板的内容很多，支持左滑动创建一条新的清单，或者长按呼出批量创建和删除功能，可快速地对内容进行归类整理。
 

 
 
写在最后
非常感谢曾给我留言的用户们，这让我对核心功能进行了重新思考。希望大家继续提供有用的建议，一起帮助完善复制清单。

                    <span>2022年2月4日-2022年2月20日，第24届冬季奥林匹克运动会（简称「北京冬奥会」）将在北京和张家口两地联合举办。
2022年3月4日-2022年3月13日，第13届冬季残疾人奥林匹克运动会（简称「北京冬残奥会」）也将在上述两市举办。
冬奥在即，你可曾完整、系统地了解过北京冬奥会？你知道北京冬奥会的火炬叫什么名字吗？冬残奥的吉祥物「xuě róng róng」怎么写吗？你知道冬奥特许商品吗？
看了上面的问题，你可能会一脸问号：「北京冬奥会不就是一场运动会吗，还有这么多周边产品吗？」
答案是肯定的。如果你想了解这些「周边」的话，接下来我将带你探寻这片未知世界。
非商品类
会徽
北京冬奥会的会徽名为「冬梦」，设计灵感源于中国汉字「冬」，在经过设计之后使会徽兼具东方文化和现代风格，整体看起来像两个运动员（上半部分为滑冰运动员，下半部分为滑雪运动员），中间的线条「代表举办地起伏的山峦、赛场、冰雪滑道和节日飘舞的丝带」。该会徽的主题色彩为蓝色，寓意「梦想与未来」，红、黄两色则选于中国国旗，代表「运动的激情、青春与活力」。
冬梦
北京冬残奥会的会徽名为「飞跃」，以汉字「飞」为设计本体，在调整汉字结构后展现了其动感和力度，展现了一位正奋力冲向终点的残疾人运动员。它「整体充满了昂扬向上之激情，奋进飞跃之动感，色彩丰富，构图完美，象征并激发运动员以坚强的意志作为精神的翅膀，在冬残奥赛场上放飞青春梦想」。
飞跃
以上两个会徽（矢量文件）都能在北京冬奥组委官网下载。（友情提示：若要使用，请遵守会徽规范手册使用）
火炬
北京冬奥会的火炬名叫「飞扬」。此火炬以祥云纹样“打底”，自下而上，从祥云纹逐渐过渡到雪花图案，最后在顶端化身为飞扬的火焰。祥云纹恰好与2008年北京奥运会主火炬塔呼应，凸显了北京「双奥之城」的特点。

                    <span>人在北京，开过上百款车，自己分别有前驱SUV、后驱轿车和电动车，聊聊经验。
东北有句老话：一猪二熊三老虎。不是真的说野猪的战斗力秒杀东北虎，而是人遇到野猪，往往不如遇到老虎那么害怕，结果被野猪挑死了。
按照不同天气，对应的警惕程度应该是这样的顺序：
雪天＜雨天＜雨夹雪＜冷雾
雪天好说，地上都白了，是个智商正常的都知道该慢，提高预判警醒着开。雨天要比雪天更小心，因为车速高了之后，轮胎会与地面之间形成一层薄薄的水膜，导致附着力大幅下降，但很多人开车的时候有种操蛋的逻辑，感觉破水而行很爽，甚至故意加速压水坑，要是赶上单侧轮胎水坑里踩油门，那就离失控不远了。
所以相比下雪，雨天更应该提高警惕。
接下来是雨夹雪，这种情况就像过地雷阵，很难判断前方路面到底是水，还是冰层，还是冰水混合物。雨夹雪最可怕的是，不像雪天那样，司机会一直保持警惕。很多司机遇到雨夹雪，刚一开始心里还挺紧张，聚精会神，越开心里越放松。车速提升、预判变短，甚至回到常规驾驶习惯，以至于前方车辆减速时，自己的车刚好处于冰水混合的路面，只能眼看着爆前车菊。
我曾经跑高速，真实的经历告诉我，最可怕的天气是冷雾，为什么呢？冷雾一般发生在深夜和凌晨，诱因大概是某个区域短时间内气温骤降，导致瞬间起了大雾。雾天开车各位都知道该怎么操作吧？打开前后雾灯，慢速行驶，非必要不开双闪。
但突发性的冷雾，大家都把注意力放在视线上了，却漏掉了一个特别重大的危险隐患——路面凝水/结霜。这种情况比雨夹雪形成的暗冰更可怕，因为在深夜凌晨，路面是否凝水结霜几乎没法分辨，这时候一脚刹车下去，如果是结霜路面，车辆特别容易启动ABS和EBD，一些经验不足的司机就慌了，因为这种表现和他们的心理预期极不相符：
不就是下雾了么，为什么刹不住车了？
经验不够的司机这时候就特别容易慌，从而出现乱打方向等谜之操作，进而导致事故。
最后附上我很久以前经历并总结的一次道路结冰导致七车连追事故：

                    <span>我喜欢这句话，“我们无权评论别人的人生，同理别人也不可以。”
肯定有许多人会过来阴阳怪气，“那可真是无权”（评论区果为如此，承认自己可能是特别难的一件事）。
不患人之不己知，患其不能也。
因为没有人能够比事主自己更了解自己，所以没法评价人生；对于同理，假装情绪去“可怜或者怜惜”我觉得想必都是虚伪的：不知他人苦，无法同理。
在不违法的前提下，做任何事情都是自己的自由，网间相传的事情，狗头萝莉这样一位主播何尝不是类似于“陈冠希门”一般的受害者呢？
关于早年的猥亵和强奸，既然已经在网上公开，不妨报警，众所周知，无论猥亵还是强奸如果要走法律程序，那么其重点就是证据。想要证明犯罪事实，至少要有以下核心证据中的几个形成证据体系：

医院病历以及报告单（可能非常不容易取到，时间已经相隔太久）
被告人的供述以及辩解（有大概率可以取得）
受害人的陈述以及辨认笔录（确凿取得）
案发现场勘验检查笔录以及照片（难以取得）
能够证明双方是否发生性关系的精斑检验鉴定意见书（难以取得）
能够证明被告人是否采取暴力、胁迫或其他手段以威吓受害人的证人证言（可能可以取得）
能够证明受害人是否曾通过微信、短信和电话等方式向外传递求救信息的证人证言（刑事侦查可以恢复电子数文）
能够证明受害人是否存在反抗、胁迫等迹象的案发现场（酒店入口、走廊）监控视频

在以上证据的采集上，毋庸置疑，警方是十分专业的。然而由于本事件自发生到报警，时间间隔已经较长了，部分证据的取得可能难度颇大，不过在知乎依旧怀有热情的时代，我想会有无数愿意给予协助帮助的人。
当然，关于刑事方面的建议我还是更为推荐去做专业咨询（我只能大体给一点点提示，这不是我擅长的领域，可以咨询两位女律师 @黄小牛 @王逸然 ）。
关于高额违约金，涉及违约要付出的成本，让狗头萝莉背上高额违约金的原因是合同约定发生根本性违约时应当支付高额违约金——这件事情愿打愿挨，没有什么办法。
虽然都说，违约金，性质上以补偿性为主，惩罚性为辅。
但实际里面，无论是法院判决还是仲裁，其实都会基于会综合考虑实际损失、履行情况、过错程度、预期利益等因素，并根据公平和诚实信用原则进行认定。
其中会重点考虑主播的知名程度、主播的主观过错、平台对主播培养和人气维系的情况、平台基于连续性合同履行所产生的预期利益损失。
从合作之初，其实甲方设计来说，本就是律师通过精巧的合同设计来约束主播，而主播的行为被装进款式多样的违约套餐中。
稍有不慎，就会触发高额索赔。
纵然知道违约金很高，然而主播还是得签：无他，双方地位本来初始就不平等。
当然，对于类似虎牙平台的资源倾斜来说（一个主播很多时候都是资源堆出来的），确实也具有设置高额违约金的必要性。
以主播韦朕8522万天价违约金案为例，裁判机构一般会认为直播作为新兴产业具有较强的行业特点，直播平台对主播依赖性较强且行业间竞争激烈，平台经营者需要投入大量人力物力进行主播的推广和人气维系，顶级主播的直播间观看人数和粉丝数量对平台利益具有重大隐形关联。
当然我想最开始签约的时候，狗头萝莉甚至不能完全理解合约对于自身的限制程度（比如私德条款之类纵然明星都不了解，何况一个游戏主播）。
可是她既然在网络上说了她的过往，我想从法律上也许不是她不懂，而是已经失去了心气，这个时候的她，依旧还希望有人会倾泻予她以阳光。
想起有个KWM的姑娘很善良，前天转过来她直播时候的视频，并评论“唏嘘于人生的不同，但是可以从泫然欲泪里感受不甘，以及无法脱身”。
面包和牛奶都会有的，要振作起来，自己可以拯救自己，做一个你曾经想要成为的，能给大家带来更多美好的人吧。

                    <span>大家好，我是《画江湖之不良人》第五季的导演兼半拉编剧，李帅帅。（开场白直接扒的舒导，实在太难想了！）
犹记得当初舒导被市场的大佬们围在会议室写知乎的窘境，犹记得我叼着烟嘲笑的嘴脸，犹记得市场大佬那略有深意的回眸现在回想起来让我倍感深刻。



在唠些有营养的之前，请容我唠叨两句，谁叫你们给我吐槽的机会呢~
时间回溯到不良人4播出之时，在4收获不错的口碑背后，大家不知道的是我们透支了什么，公司开始动荡，而我，正准备离职。就在这个时候，关导和舒导找到了我。
对面是劈着大腿的关导，一旁是面色苍白挂着诡异笑容的舒导。
关：“帅啊，你来导不良人5吧。”
我：“哦，啊？”
这时办公室门开了，端着茶杯的周导走到我身后，吐了口茶叶。
周：“别怕，我带你。”
我：“我…”
周：“哦对了，是5和6啊。”
那个时候我早就知道做原创动画不赚钱，但是我更想不明白的是这帮人从几十人干到四百多人又掉到一百多人……还tm搞原创，这不疯了吗？
后来我明白了，凤凰啊，是需要涅槃的。
就这样，我接过了接力棒，是整体制作周期缩减一半的不良人5、6。
你们看我说的挺热血，真到开干的时候，真的太难了。首先的难题就是人员配置，动荡期我们流失了大量第4季的班底，为了增强画质我们还换了新流程，这让整个项目充满了大量的不确定性，我们要在更短的周期内，不断试错，同时还要保持制作水准。就这样，我还将画幅提升到了21:9，为此制片部门还开了大会。
翁总监：“ 21:9 ，代价是什么？”
我：“（小心翼翼）拍到的东西会更多，但是画面会更有张力，更贴近电影，更能凸显我们的画质，增强沉浸感blablabla……”
在座鸦雀无声，我艹我当时紧张的不行。
翁总监：“艹，干了！”
首当其冲的就是资产，新流程下，我们以前的所有资产积累都需要更新，没有一样可以直接用（感谢大个儿和小倩，资产组一度就八个人，兄弟们太难了）。尽管如此，我们还要更进一步…</span>

一是完善了医疗救治资源配置。在竞赛场馆设置固定医疗站、比赛场地医疗站、观众医疗站等，北京赛区和延庆赛区共设置88个医疗站，提供现场医疗急救及伤病员分流转运工作。从17家定点医院和2家院前急救机构选拔1140名医疗骨干作为场馆医疗保障人员，配置457名院级后备力量；从12家三级医院抽选120名医护人员组建市级后备队；配备场馆救护车74辆，其中负压救护车54辆。按照冬奥疫情防控政策要求，协同北京冬奥组委将涉冬奥伤病员分为新冠肺炎确诊与疑似患者、闭环内的发热症状患者、闭环内其他伤病员、闭环外的发热症状患者、闭环外其他伤病员等五类，调整优化定点医院收治任务，18家定点医院实施精准分类收治，避免不同风险伤病员流线交叉。赛时将从定点医院抽调1188名医务人员、840名院内专家，提供及时、高效的医疗服务，同时，60名市级专家、10名院士给予高水平技术支持。
二是制定了“一场一策”和“一院一策”医疗保障方案。针对每一场所比赛运动损伤特点，专门配备了骨科、口腔科等学科医务人员。同时，在冰球场馆增配CT、牙椅等设备，结合场所环境特点，开展有针对性的现场急救演练，实现“一场一策”医疗保障。为发挥专业学科优势，提高医疗救治能力，定点医院制定了“一院一策”医疗保障方案，北京大学第三医院延庆医院将1.2万平方米的独立病房楼改建为冬奥医疗中心，设置72张病床，配套CT和核磁等设备、手术室、核酸采样、发热门诊等；北京安贞医院腾退104张床位改造为冬奥专区；北京大学人民医院、北京朝阳医院、北京世纪坛医院等调整院内布局，设置病房专区，配备专用CT、核磁等设备，建设负压杂交手术室，为冬奥医疗救治提供有力保障。
三是加强了冬奥村综合诊所建设。建成了1500平方米的北京冬奥村综合诊所和1658平方米的延庆冬奥村综合诊所，覆盖急诊、理疗康复、影像、中医、牙科等18个学科，满足赛时每日16 小时基本门诊和24小时紧急救治需求。目前，北京冬奥村综合诊所医疗设备调试已完成；延庆冬奥村综合诊所CT、核磁、DR方舱已调试到位，保证赛时急诊、门诊、康复转院等医疗救治工作有序开展。
四是强化了培训演练和血液保障。按照全员培训、内外结合原则，加大医疗保障人员冬奥知识、英语水平、滑雪技能等内容培训，40名滑雪医生达到国际救援水平，1900名医疗保障人员具备基础急救能力。市红十字血液中心建立赛时调血机制，Rh阴性血液持续保持在1800～2000单位。
北京市将统筹全市医疗资源，全力做好冬奥会、冬残奥会医疗救治保障工作，为各国运动员和国际友人提供优质高效的医疗救治保障。

冬奥会的到来，不仅让更多的孩子感受到冰雪运动的乐趣，更为孩子们树立了新的奋斗目标。

在南京奥体中心，就有这样一群孩子，即使懵懵懂懂，却对未来能站上冬奥赛场充满期待。

    从黑龙江省七台河市走出的世界冠军张杰，是两届世界大冬会女子3000米接力冠军队成员，曾在短道速滑世锦赛中打破世界纪录。

    2014年，张杰回到家乡七台河，利用学习多年的运动康复技能组建了一支由残障孩子组成的短道速滑队，不拿薪金，义务执教。

    这支由残障孩子组成的短道速滑队成员曾在2017年第11届世界冬季特奥会的速度滑冰项目中斩获4金2银，又在2019年第15届世界夏季特奥会的速度轮滑项目中获得3金2银2铜的好成绩。

    世界冠军培养出了世界冠军。对此，张杰却说，金牌不重要，只要孩子们收获快乐就好。
    从七台河出发，张杰在赛场上为国争光。荣誉加身，她又为爱折返，为“折翼天使”插上梦想的翅膀，成为家乡冰雪运动“火种”的播撒者。“我所有的快乐、幸福和人生感悟都是滑冰带给我的，滑冰是我的全部。”张杰说。

                    <span>去年当爹了，说实话哪怕1个孩子，我都觉得自己的轿车空间有些捉襟见肘。带娃家庭对于空间的需求提升，远不止一个座位+儿童安全座椅那么简单，而是伴娃左右的各种杂七杂八，都得有地方妥妥安置。
我就想，以后三胎家庭越来越多，要应付3个孩子的日常出行，这样的SUV有吗？于是我罗列了大家庭SUV的实用条件：

绝对空间一定要够；
相对空间，也就是内部灵活性必须有，能让车主自己组合布局；
人性化设计，包括按键布局、随手就能利用的储物格等等，很考验厂商的用户思维；
在满足以上三点的基础上，车辆的智能化也可以为出行提供便利，这项并非强求。


离家不远就有很多4S店，带着这些需求，我“假模假式”探访了一波，结果被一款即将上市的新车按住了，它就是一汽－大众旗舰SUV——揽境。这款车指导价为29.99~39.99万元，不到30万就能入手的德系大块头，值得细细品味！

而且我发现，这次一汽-大众为揽境邀请的品牌代言人于和伟，从某种程度上讲与车辆的定位十分契合。于和伟属于可塑性很高的演技派，从《大宅门》里吐口水的白占安，到《新三国》里“接着奏乐接着舞”的刘备，戏路实在是广。反过来看，揽境是定位于大家庭兼商务的全能旗舰SUV，于和伟站在揽境旁边，显然可以突出后者的全能属性——力图满足客户所有用车场景。

绝对空间 | 随便折腾！

这家店有两台揽境，一台作为展车摆在显眼的位置，另一台即将办好上路手续。一汽-大众的店员很热情，把车洗好了让我独自享受！时间有限，我马上按照大家庭SUV的使用条件，一项一项“折腾”起来。
一汽-大众揽境 前两排空间展示
首先是前排空间，调整好坐姿后，身高1.68米的我头部距离车顶尚有两拳距离。这是在我意料之中的，因为揽境的车身高度接近1.8米，对于身高1.9米以下的人来说都是完全够用的。

保持驾驶位座椅不变，来到第二排。揽境采用2+2+2的6座布局形式，且全系可以选装7座。这…</span>

                    <span>从海南度假回来有 2 个月了，但我仍然时常想起在海口的最后一个夜晚，那个大爷真是给我留下了深刻的印象。

在到海口之前，我已经在三亚和万宁待了挺长时间，对海滩，寄居蟹，椰子和清补凉已经不再像刚来时候那么热衷，而寒冷，干燥，昂贵又逼仄的北京，却非常奇怪的对我产生了越来越大的吸引力，总之，我是想回去了。

最后一个晚上，是在海口，我找了机场附近的一个民宿，好在第二天天亮之后更方便的去机场，然后回到阔别已久的北京。

民宿在一片别墅区里，即便是在别墅区里，这样的一座4层的小楼，也显得很有气派，装修的不算豪华，但很舒服。院子里则停着 4 辆奔驰 GLS。我在订这个民宿的时候，看到评论里说，这个民宿会免费用奔驰接送机，我倒不是图这个，主要是想，虽然有点不可思议，但能用奔驰接送机的民宿，其他方面按理不应该太差。

我被安排到了 4 楼的房间，我简单收拾了一下，出门遛了个弯。

遛弯结束后，我没立刻回房间，一楼有一个挺大的餐厅，我准备把中午没喝完的粥继续喝两口，进餐厅的时候我发现，已经坐了两个人，一个年纪大点，是个大爷，一个年纪小点，是个大叔，他们前面也摆了好些菜，不过这餐桌这么大，也不妨碍我，我坐到离他们稍远些的位置，然后开始喝粥。

为什么不到房间里喝呢？因为刚入住的时候，前台就告诉我，为了保持整体清洁，老板禁止客人在房间里吃饭。

喝了几口粥后，桌上的大爷跟我闲聊，问我从哪来，玩几天，什么时候走，我应付了两句之后，问他，你是这里的老板吧？大爷听到我的话一愣，然后哈哈大笑，说我不是，我是个打杂的，老板是旁边这个。

旁边的大叔连连摆手，说大爷才是老板，自己只是打工的。

聊了两句之后，大爷似乎有点兴致，邀请我一起喝酒，我注意到大爷已经开了一瓶红酒，但我不太好意思，就推辞了一下，大爷很热情，直接让大叔给我倒上了一杯端了过来，然后大叔有事就先走了。

                    <span>These days, we all have a few dozen passwords. Fortunately, the bulk of those passwords are probably for websites, and you probably access most websites through your internet browser, and most browsers have a built-in password manager. The most common internet browsers also have a synchronization feature to help you distribute your passwords between the browsers you run across all your devices, so you&#x27;re never without your login information when you need it.

📢前言

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第63天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：有效的字母异位词
给定两个字符串 s 和 t ，编写一个函数来判断 t 是否是 s 的字母异位词。
注意：若 s 和 t 中每个字符出现的次数都相同，则称 s 和 t 互为字母异位词。
示例1:
输入: s &#x3D; &quot;anagram&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;nagaram&quot;
输出: true

示例2:
输入: s &#x3D; &quot;rat&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;car&quot;
输出: false

提示：
1 代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t)
    {
        List indexS &#x3D; new List();
        List indexT &#x3D; new List();

        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：72 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了82.28%的用户
内存消耗：39 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了7.60%的用户

🌻Java 方法一：排序
思路解析
t 是 s 的异位词等价于「两个字符串排序后相等」。因此我们可以对字符串 s 和 t 分别排序，看排序后的字符串是否相等即可判断。
此外，如果 s 和 t 的长度不同，t 必然不是 s 的异位词。
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() !&#x3D; t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] str1 &#x3D; s.toCharArray();
        char[] str2 &#x3D; t.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(str1);
        Arrays.sort(str2);
        return Arrays.equals(str1, str2);
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：3 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了74.73%的用户
内存消耗：38.5 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了67.34%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( nlogn )
空间复杂度：O( long n )

🌻Java 方法二：哈希
思路解析
t 是 s 的异位词等价于「两个字符串中字符出现的种类和次数均相等」。
由于字符串只包含 26个小写字母，因此我们可以维护一个长度为 26 的频次数组 table，先遍历记录字符串 s 中字符出现的频次，然后遍历字符串 t，减去 table 中对应的频次，如果出现table[i]代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() !&#x3D; t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] str1 &#x3D; s.toCharArray();
        char[] str2 &#x3D; t.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(str1);
        Arrays.sort(str2);
        return Arrays.equals(str1, str2);
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：4 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了45.11%的用户
内存消耗：38.5 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了73.10%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( nlogn )
空间复杂度：O( long n )

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第3天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
前言
作为开发者，单例这个就再也熟悉不过了，但是作为多种单例实现模式，我个人觉得双重校验锁是非常不多的实现，我们简单来分析一下其原理。
正文
先来说一下Java版本的，后面会涉及Kotlin中的代码我们再做比对。
代码实现
Java代码实现如下：
//双重校验锁单例
public class SingleInstance {
    //必须volatile修饰 见分析1
    private volatile static SingleInstance instance;
    //私有化构造函数
    private SingleInstance() {
    }

    public static SingleInstance getInstance() {
        //第一个判空 见分析2
        if (instance &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
            synchronized (SingleInstance.class) {
                //第二个判空 见分析3
                if (instance &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
                    //新建实例
                    instance &#x3D; new SingleInstance();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

首先这里synchronized关键字没有修饰整个getInstance函数，因为这个函数可能使用地方很多，这样就会造成其他线程阻塞，不太好，所以这里只同步了一段代码。
分析2：为什么在进入同步代码块时需要进行进行判空，假如有线程A和线程B，这时线程A先判断instance为null，所以它进入了同步代码块，创建了对象，然后线程B再进来时，它就不必再进入同步代码快了，可以直接返回，也其实也就是懒加载，可以加快执行速度。
分析3：为什么在同步代码块中还要再进行一次判断呢，假如有线程A和线程B，它俩A先调用方法，B紧接着调用，这时A、B在分析2出的判空都是空，所以A进入同步代码块，B进行等待，当A进入同步代码块中创建了对象后，A线程释放了锁，这时B再进入，如果这时不加分析3的判空，B又会创建一个实例，这明显不符合规矩。
分析1：那既然加了2层判断，那为什么还要加个volatile关键字呢，这里知识点就有点多了。
因为新建实例的代码：
instance &#x3D; new SingleInstance();
它不是一个原子操作，这个简单的赋值可以分为3步：
1、给SingleInstance分配内存
2、调用SingleInstance的构造方法
3、把instance指向分配的内存空间
这是正常逻辑的3个步骤，也只有按1 2 3执行后，这个instance才不是null。
但是Java内存模型允许这个进行指令重排序，也就是这3步可能是123也可能是132，所以这里就有问题了。
假如线程A和线程B，线程A已经跑到分析3处的代码，这时这条指令执行是132，刚把步骤3执行完，这时线程B跑到了分析1处的代码，会发现instance不为null了，这时线程B就直接返回了，从而导致错误。
既然知道了原因，那volatile关键字就是解决这个的，它可以禁止指令重新排序，而且保证所有线程看到这个变量是一致的，也就是不会从缓存中读取(这个特性后面有机会再说)，所以在创建instance实例时，它的步骤都是123，就不会出错了。
总结
其实一个小小的双重校验锁单例都还有蛮多知识点，后面我们来分析分析Kotlin中的单例都一般如何实现以及原理。</span>

                    <span>我们对 DiffUtil 的使用可能被带偏了
前面都是我的流水账, 觉得看起来很没劲的, 可以直接跳转到本质小节,.
DiffUtil 的优势
我在最初接触 DiffUtil 时, 心中便对它有颇多的好感, 包括:
算法听提来就很nb, 一定是个好东西;
简化了 RecyclerView 的刷新逻辑, 无须关心该调用 notifyItemInserted 还是 notifyItemChanged, 一律submitList 就完事了(虽然 notifyDataSetChanged 也能做到, 但是性能拉胯, 而且没有动画);
LiveData 或者 Flow 监听单一 List 数据源时, 往往很难知道, 整个 List 中到底哪些数据项被更新了, 只能调用notifyDataSetChanged 方法, 而 DiffUtil 恰好就能解决这个问题, 无脑 submitList 就完事了.
DiffUtil 代码示例
使用 DiffUtil 时, 代码大致如下:
data class Item (
    var id: Long &#x3D; 0,
    var data: String &#x3D; &quot;&quot;
)

class DiffAdapter : RecyclerView.Adapter() {
    // AsyncListDiffer 类位于 androidx.recyclerview.widget 包下
    // 这里以 AsyncListDiffer 的使用来举例, 使用 ListAdapter 或者直接用 DiffUtil, 也存在后面的问题
    private val differ &#x3D; AsyncListDiffer(this, object : DiffUtil.ItemCallback() {
        override fun areItemsThe…</span>

                    <span>在本届CES2022，AMD带来新款桌面处理器、桌面显卡、移动处理器和移动显卡，其中的新款桌面显卡就是升级6nm制程工艺Radeon RX 6400 XT和Radeon RX 6500 XT ，而其中的Radeon RX 6500 XT在今天正式发售。
Radeon RX 6500 XT关键词：千元价位、6nm、RDNA 2

01/ 关于Radeon RX 6500 XT
AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT实际规格让人还是有些意外的，除了一些规格特殊之外，还有就是居然保留了【RDNA 2】大部分功能特性，甚至还最先采用了更为先进的6nm制程工艺，绝非新瓶旧酒的产品，这点来说挺不错的。
关于定价：目前Radeon RX 6500 XT官方指导价是1599元，如果关注装机市场朋友应该有感受，就是市面在1000-2000这个价格区间已经很久一段时间没有新品，上一代这价格区间的产品因为矿工需求等缘故，要么价格暴涨，要么直接没货，所以这次产品补全还挺重要，毕竟还是有不少用户显卡性能需求可能没那么高，只要求满足1080P FHD游戏体验即可。

【RDNA 2】特性全部保留
AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT基于Navi 24 GPU核心打造，依旧是RDNA 2架构，拥有16组CU计算单元，每一个CU计算单元里都包含一个【Ray Accelerator 光线加速器】，总共1024个流处理器，同时配备16MB无限缓存；显存部分配备了4GB的GDDR6显存，显存位宽为64位。
虽然核心\显存规格比其它RDNA 2架构高价卡低不少，但因为它也是最先采用6nm工艺制造，所以频率反倒是RDNA 2架构GPU里面最高的，且高出不少，基本就是靠飙高频来拼性能。

伴随RDNA 2架构，DX12U、DSAPI，DirectX光线追踪、可变速率着色、网格着色器、采样器反馈这些技术特性在…</span>

                    <span>「如期而至」APP上线一年左右，目前已经更新到 1.9.3 版本。去年重新设计和优化了很多地方，也如期完成了对 iPad 和 Siri 两个重要功能的支持，让记录和管理物品变得更加方便和快捷。
顺着这一年的版本更新记录，在此总结一下「如期而至」APP 的变化。
主题颜色修改
「如期而至」默认主题色是蓝色，一开始很多人说颜色太冲眼或太直男，希望有多个主题色可以选择，所以很快就推出了有 5 个颜色选择的版本。随着时间对色彩感受的弱化，我也意识到预设的几个颜色会满足不了用户的选择，于是后面又推出了自定义颜色，真正实现“赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，你的APP你做主”。

修改主题颜色之后，整个APP的主导色会跟着改变，包括小组件、消息通知框等。在使用自定义颜色的时侯，建议不要使用太淡的颜色，因为在诸如回顾视图日历、iPad 版环形图等地方会自动计算颜色深浅，太浅的颜色就会造成颜色异常。受制于 iOS 开发机制，APP图标没法动态同步自定义的颜色，所以目前只有 5 种颜色的图标可供选择。
丰富小组件样式
小组件如今有 5 款样式可供选择，“即将到期列表”可以按标签来进行显示。最早做的小组件设计不规范，在每个机型上显示都会不一样，后来改为按照公式自动计算间隙、宽高度，目前在各个设备上就比较正常了。

优化通知提醒
一开始做的提醒设定是每天都会进行提醒，比如选择了提醒范围 30 天，就会在物品剩余 30 天内每天都进行提醒，频繁的提醒容易让人烦燥和麻木。经过一番摸索后改成了递增的方式，越接近过期的物品提醒次数越多。
“提醒范围”每项对应的提醒时间点
增加开封功能
“开封”对于物品期限管理来说很重要，像是化妆品开瓶、咖啡豆开封等使用场景很有意义，所以也加入了开封的功能。按住物品向左滑动，显示开封设置界面。如果是当天拆封进行记录的，只需要填写新的期限保存即可；而如果是之前开封的，可以向右滑动开封界面，点…</span>

                    <span>很多问题不只有一种答案，比如这一个。
既可以就全新蒙迪欧设计和竞争力作答，也可以就全新蒙迪欧演变以及为何这般作答。两个答案都可以回答这个问题。只不过第一种回答是「鱼」，第二种回答是「渔」，需要读者自行判断，提炼答案。
我们尝试以第二种回答方式入手。
全新蒙迪欧并不是一款出人意料的车。
未真正亮相前，全新蒙迪欧大抵会有两种结果：一、由美国人（欧洲人）操刀继续做这款车真正意义上的迭代，在中美两国市场投放；二、按照EVOS的外观设计，衍生出轿车版的中级轿车，并命名为蒙迪欧。
关于全新蒙迪欧外观，实际上已经建立了两种预期，剩下的就是待全新蒙迪欧揭晓，告诉我们最终选择了哪一种。这就是为什么没有出人意料。
回过头去，美国人设计的蒙迪欧会是什么样子？
如果推测美国人设计的蒙迪欧，就必须先回到全新一代福克斯以及即将中期改款的福克斯上来。这是一款非常重要的车子。
2018年，全新一代福克斯在中国上市。作为福特全球车型，福克斯没有太多中国市场的元素。当时福特在中国的设计中心也没有成立，但随着福特中国战略的逐步推进，在福克斯这款车上，看到了越来越多的中国元素。
现在的福克斯拥有两套设计，一种为标准版，小开嘴、三角灯，大灯中间回形标；另一种是猎装版，大灯保持不变，但中网开始靠近EVOS以及蒙迪欧。


中控也是如此。新福克斯上市时采用了全球统一的内饰，但福特中国研发出了SYNC+车机系统之后，福特在华销售的车型都同步更换了这套车机，以至于个别车型出现了些审美上的问题。


按照历代福克斯和蒙迪欧之间设计上的关联，海外媒体的好事者曾经做出过下一代产品的假想图，只是这个假想图在今天看来，变成了Mustang Mach-E，但蒙迪欧也可以是这样。



那么，为什么会出现这种情况？
大的原因是——
中国市场和美国市场在消费需求上正在割裂，表现为通用、福特全力推动SUV品类的建设，逐步取消了轿车产品的研发…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
人物志系列停更许久，笔者本想先把陈朵人物志写完，但是思来想去，这个人物实在太火了，还是不凑那个热闹吧。
回望作品，笔者发现王也这个角色总能让人感触颇深，米二也愿意为他花费笔墨描绘他的人生轨迹，细腻之处甚至让笔者怀疑，王也就是米二理想中的自己。
他就像你我身边的一个朋友，在面上活得潇洒，混不吝，遇事有能量，有手段，年纪轻轻便走到了物质和精神两个层面的高峰。在骨子里他也温润如玉，豁达自在，哪怕怀璧其罪没有惶恐不安，哪怕力有未逮也始终放不下天下苍生， @天师道的白山正 说他和周圣合称”内圣外王“，这个”王“便是王也所行的王道。而在笔者看来，王也这个人物不仅仅是有其崇高的一面，他也有凡俗人的一面，相比“藏巧于贱”的张楚岚和“飞蛾扑火”的诸葛青，他向往逍遥世间的偷闲，也更是不愿沾染这世间的因果。
在笔者看来，王也其人，配得上”无为而无不为“一语。

生于安乐窝
王也作为中海集团老板王卫国的三公子，他的身家算得上出道即巅峰，投的一手好胎。
父亲的生意家大业大，父母还非常恩爱，生了三个儿子不够（王亦、王又、王也，瞧瞧这名字起的，啧啧啧），还想继续生闺女，甚至还有能助兴的蓝色小药丸，不得不说也总有一个幸福的原生家庭。

王卫国原型
此处有个小细节，王也的父亲叫做王卫国，出身行伍，上过边境，在部队里面也曾是吆五喝六的人物，其原型则是真实世界的两位牛人的混合体。
一位是王校长他爸，16岁就参军，17岁就到吉林省集安县的鸭绿江边成为了一名侦察兵，25岁就晋升排长进陆军学院进修，35岁则转业下海，62岁时登顶华人首富。这份经历和王卫国的人设不能说完全一致，只能说一毛一样。

另一位原型人物则是“玉帝专业户”，国家一级演员·真·王卫国。
先后在《西游记续集》、《宝莲灯》及《宝莲灯续集》中，饰演玉皇大帝一角，因此被广大观众熟知。有趣的是，正是因为王卫国扮演玉皇大帝的形象让人过目难忘，在以后的…</span>

                    <span>《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。
我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。
音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。


关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战
本篇文章翻译自官方的👉总览文章，这篇文章基本上把 Flutter 介绍清楚了，如果想从总体上知道 Flutter 是咋回事，本篇文章是最好的教程了。
以下是正文
本文旨在从高层级提供一个 Flutter 框架结构的总体概览，介绍一些其设计上的核心原则和概念。
Flutter 是一个跨平台的 UI 工具包，目的是一份代码可以运行在不同的操作系统上，比如 Android、IOS等等，同时也可以让应用直接和底层的平台服务交互。我们的目标是：尽量用一份代码，开发者就可以在不用的平台上开发出高性能、高保真的 APP。拥抱差异，更少代码，更高性能。
在开发阶段，Flutter 运行在虚拟机上，虚拟机提供了 hot reload 的功能，可以加载每次开发者改动的差异代码，而不需要全代码的编译。在正式版本上，Flutter 应用是直接编译成了机器码：Intel x64、ARM、JavaScript等等。这里说的开发阶段和正式版本是指 Flutter 产物的模式，Flutter 的产物有三种模式 debug、release、profile。Flutter 的 framework 是开源的，开源的协议是 BSD 协议，并且有活跃繁荣的第三方库社区，这些优秀的第三方库很好的补充了 Flutter 的能力。
本文的总览分为以下几个部分：
分层模型: Flutter 的组成部分
响应式 UI : Flutter UI 开发的核心概念
Widgets 介绍: Flutter UI 代码构建的基础
渲染流程: Flutter 是如何将 UI 代码转化为屏幕像素点的

需求背景
刚开始接到这个需求时，第一时间想到的是做成跟银行类app一样用户退到主页之后，需要在通知栏显示“XXX在后台运行”，并且该通知不能被清除，只有用户重新进入app再消失。然后就想到了一个方案前台服务(foregroundService) 来实现，于是撸起袖子就是干。
1、创建一个ForegroundService继承Service
2、重写onCreate等一系列方法
3、创建通知，根据不同版本来开启服务

根据不同版本开启服务
4、监听Application的生命周期，在onActivityStopped中显示前台服务，在onActivityResumed中取消前台服务


搞定，运行代码看看效果。。。
哦豁
完全不对，遇到的问题：
1、并不是所有onActivityStopped执行都是应用被切换至后台---此处百度“如何监听应用被切换至后台”
2、onActivityResumed的时候stopService如果操作快一下到后台一下到前台会收到一大堆的崩溃信息

崩溃信息
遇到问题那咱就解决问题呗，开干~~
1、这个问题倒是很好解决，百度上一大把，添加一个refCount变量，在onActivityStarted方法中++，在onActivityStopped方法中--，然后在onActivityStopped中判断当refCount等于0时表示应用退到后台


2、这个问题崩溃的信息意思就是调用了startForegroundService之后没有调用 Service.startForeground()方法，造成这个问题的原因就是短时间内重复进入退出应用，前台服务来不及start就已经被stop
那怎么办呢？
第一时间想到的是延迟几秒再stopService，写完运行结果还是一大堆崩溃0.0
于是：于是：发自内心的问自己，为什么要用前台服务？为什么要用前台服务？有没有其他方案呢？
答案肯定是有的，为什么一定要用前台服务呢？直接用通知不行么，好，就用通知
于是，就用一个通知管理类ForegroundPushManager来处理通知的显示和关闭


这样就完成了应用退到后台显示通知的功能了。

最后遇到的第二个问题如果有好的方案解决的话请大家踊跃指点，谢谢！！

                    <span>在 Google I/O 2019，我们分享了 Room 2.2 的最新进展。尽管当时已经支持了很多功能，如 支持 Flow API，支持预填充数据库，支持一对一及多对多数据库关系，但是开发者们对 Room 有着更高的期望，我们也致力于此，在 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 版本中发布了很多开发者们期待的新功能！包括自动化迁移，关系查询方法以及支持 Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) 等等。下面我们就来逐一介绍这些新功能！
如果您更喜欢通过视频了解此内容，请 点击此处 查看。
自动化迁移
在谈自动化迁移之前，先看看什么是数据库迁移。假如您更改了数据库 schema，就需要根据数据库版本进行迁移，以防用户设备内置数据库中现有数据丢失。
如果您使用 Room，那么在 数据库迁移 过程中会进行检查并验证更新后的 schema，另外您也可以在 @Database 中设置 exportSchema，来导出 schema 信息。
对于 Room 2.4.0 版本之前的数据库迁移，您需要实现 Migration 类，并在其中编写大量复杂冗长的 SQL 语句，来处理不同版本之间的迁移。这种手动迁移的形式，非常容易引发各种错误。
现在 Room 支持了自动迁移，让我们通过两个示例来对比手动迁移和自动迁移:
修改表名
假设有一个包含两个表的数据库，表名分别是 Artist 和 Track，现在想要将表名 Track 改为 Song。

如果使用手动迁移，必须编写和执行 SQL 语句才能更改，需要如下操作:
val MIGRATION_1_2: Migration &#x3D; Migration(1, 2) {
    fun migrate(database: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {
        database.execSQL(&quot;ALTER TAB…</span>

前言
春节临近，在深圳干活的打工人们却在为疫情烦恼，最近出了不少病例，希望赶紧平息，能开开心心回家吧~
这几天翻了翻好久都没有维护过了的hexo博客 苍耳的博客，自从换工作后就没有时间摸鱼和学习了，博客也自然而然就停滞了下来，一到双休日只想着睡觉。。。好了，言归正传，翻到了19年刚毕业的时候做的一个跟 Termux 相关的需求，疫情严重，返乡难定，跟大家分享一个挺可爱的嘟嘟火车吧~在 Android 设备上遛一遛。
没啥技术难度，纯粹图一乐~
Termux
这是 Android 设备上的一款终端扩展软件，可以用来扩展 Android 设备上被阉割的 shell 功能，开源且不需要 root(工作空间就在app的私有目录下)，它支持 apt 管理软件包，并拥有自己的 apt 仓库源，这点就很舒服了，Termux 会维护他们的软件仓库源，仓库里有很多常用的软件包，比如说 curl, python 等等，因此可以实现支持 Python, PHP, Go, Nodejs, MySQL 等的功能环境。
简单使用
Termux 的GitHub仓库地址，可以在这里面查看安装方式。安装成功后第一次打开它会下载解压 bootstrap 包，主要用来在应用的私有目录下设置一个类 Linux 的文件结构，并设置环境变量等等。初始化完成后在 termux app 的私有目录下会解压出以下文件结构：
初始化完成后可以看到它就是一个 Linux Terminal 一样的界面，可以在里面跑 shell 命令了。然后还可以通过 apt 来安装管理软件，记得先 apt update 更新一下哈~

📢前言

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第62天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：同构字符串
给定两个字符串 s 和 t，判断它们是否是同构的。
如果 s 中的字符可以按某种映射关系替换得到 t ，那么这两个字符串是同构的。
每个出现的字符都应当映射到另一个字符，同时不改变字符的顺序。不同字符不能映射到同一个字符上，相同字符只能映射到同一个字符上，字符可以映射到自己本身。
示例1:
输入：s &#x3D; &quot;egg&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;add&quot;
输出：true

示例2:
输入：s &#x3D; &quot;foo&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;bar&quot;
输出：false

示例3:
输入：s &#x3D; &quot;paper&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;title&quot;
输出：true

提示：
可以假设 s 和 t 长度相同。
🌻C#方法：一次遍历
对比下标数组是否一致，用于检测两字符串同构。
代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t)
    {
        List indexS &#x3D; new List();
        List indexT &#x3D; new List();

        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：72 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了82.28%的用户
内存消耗：39 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了7.60%的用户

🌻Java 方法：哈希
思路解析
需要我们判断 s 和 t 每个位置上的字符是否都一一对应，即 s 的任意一个字符被 t 中唯一的字符对应，同时 t 的任意一个字符被 s 中唯一的字符对应。这也被称为「双射」的关系。
以示例 2 为例，t 中的字符 a 和 r 虽然有唯一的映射 o，但对于 s 中的字符 o 来说其存在两个映射 {a,r}，故不满足条件。
因此，我们维护两张哈希表，第一张哈希表 s2t 以 s 中字符为键，映射至 t 的字符为值，第二张哈希表t2s 以 t 中字符为键，映射至 s 的字符为值。从左至右遍历两个字符串的字符，不断更新两张哈希表，如果出现冲突（即当前下标 index 对应的字符 s[index] 已经存在映射且不为t[index] 或当前下标 index 对应的字符 t[index] 已经存在映射且不为 s[index]）时说明两个字符串无法构成同构，返回false。
如果遍历结束没有出现冲突，则表明两个字符串是同构的，返回true 即可。
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        Map s2t &#x3D; new HashMap();
        Map t2s &#x3D; new HashMap();
        int len &#x3D; s.length();
        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：24 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了25.02%的用户
内存消耗：38.4 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了48.09%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( n )
空间复杂度：O( ∣Σ∣ ) ，其中 Σ 是字符串的字符集。哈希表存储字符的空间取决于字符串的字符集大小，最坏情况下每个字符均不相同，需要O(∣Σ∣) 的空间。

前言
随着春节长假的临近，公司项目也逐渐进入封网阶段，总之千言万语最后都汇成一句话：

接下来应该有不少时间瞎搞了，但愿～
回正题，这次要说的内容正如标题所述，京东首页的吸顶效果；
在Android原生上，这貌似是一个有些麻烦的问题：
正如这篇文章所述，最主要的问题是嵌套的滑动事件无法实现两者互通：
仿京东、淘宝首页，通过两层嵌套的RecyclerView实现tab的吸顶效果
在Android中，手势在不同View之间的传递，如果不像ViewPager那样自己处理的话，就是基于
ViewParentCompat以及NestedScrollChild和NestedScrollParent那套，说白了就是一层一层的View分发传递；由此带来的问题就是，如果在两层嵌套滑动的View之间插入了一层View，这个View不支持嵌套滑动摆烂的话，就没人接着分发事件，自然无法实现嵌套滑动；
当然这只是其中一种解决方案，如果用 CoordinatorLayout 也同样可以实现这个效果；不过仍然要自定义来解决获知child中哪个是要嵌套滑动的View的问题；例如这个：
PersistentCoordinatorLayout
总之没法一步到位；
而在Flutter上，就没有上面这个问题：
如果用Flutter来做，非常简单，NestedScrollView本身就有这种隔着祖宗十八代也能找到亲戚关系的能力，并且也基于此实现了事件分发传递：换句话说，完全不需要自己处理，NestedScrollView本身就可以实现；
那么带着问题来看一下Flutter 的 NestedScrollView 是如何实现的：

概念
Drawable表示一种可以在Canvas上进行绘制的抽象的概念，它有很多种，常见的如颜色和图片都可以是一个Drawable。
优点
首先，它的使用比较简单，在xml里已经定义了大量的属性方法，我们只要熟悉各个属性的ui效果和特点就可以自己组合各种的界面效果。
其次，它的实现成本比自定义View低，一些比较简单的、定制性、重复性的UI效果使用drawable将会缩小开发成本。但是一些比较复杂的ui场景，drawable却表现不出自定义view的那种效果。
相比较于图片而言，drawable占用空间更小，这样有利于缩小apk的体积。
表现形式
Drawable尽管对于应用程序通常不可见，但Drawable可以采用多种形式：
Bitmap:最简单的Drawable，一个PNG或JPEG图像。
Nine Patch:是对PNG格式的扩展允许它指定如何对其进行拉伸和放置的信息
Vector:向量：在XML文件中定义的可绘制的一组点，线和曲线以及相关的颜色信息。 这种类型的绘图可以缩放而不会损失显示质量。
Shape:形状：包含简单的绘图命令而不是原始位图，允许在某些情况下调整更好。
Layers:图层：一个可绘制的复合物，它在彼此顶部绘制多个底层可绘图。
States:状态，一个复合drawable，根据其状态选择一组drawable中的一个。
Levels：级别：一个复合drawable，根据其级别从一组drawable中选择一个。
Scale:比例尺：一个可绘制的单个子组合可绘制的组合，其整体大小根据当前级别进行修改。

                    <span>Dislike 是一个日常生活事务管理工具。
之所以说这款 App 另类，一则 Dislike 专门设计来打理生活琐事，而非像多数同类产品一样着眼于效率提升；二则 Dislike 没有遵循任何既定的时间管理理论，完全依照普通人的日常使用「直觉」设计、开发。
这意味着使用 Dislike，你不需要为了记录、提醒一些事情去强迫自己学习任何理论，或是改变一种生活方式。
关于时间管理的完整思考，我在《我们究竟需要怎样的时间管理工具》这篇文章里有较详细的记录，感兴趣的朋友可以翻阅。
如果市面上鼎鼎大名的 GTD 类 App 你用了个遍都无法坚持，说明你很可能和我一样不是个「效率达人」，那么我非常推荐你试试 Dislike。
Dislike 基础功能介绍参见这篇文章：
 
Dislike 3.0 做了 10 余项较大的功能新增及优化，以及一堆没仔细数过的细节提升。
虽然做了很多工作，但 UI 层面仍然保持了精简、克制，这也是从 Dislike 着手设计 1.0 至今一直贯彻的理念。
拣几个 3.0 的重点功能说说。
事件创建重构

Dislike 3.0 完全重新设计、开发了事件创建功能。
这也是 3.0 版本最耗费精力的一块开发工作。
2.x 版本的事件创建逻辑本身没问题，同类日程 App 大多采用的也是类似的创建逻辑（包括 iOS 系统日历）。优点是创建流程清晰易懂，缺点是步骤稍显繁琐。
尤其对于复杂事件，常常需要多次往返于二级、甚至三级设置页面。
相较同类 App，Dislike 事件的日期、重复、提醒等设置更为灵活，这进一步加剧了 Dislike 2.x 版本创建事件的交互复杂度。
不破不立，3.0 版本推翻重构后的事件创建模块 ，所有设置项均可在 1 个页面内完成。

前言
收到我人生最大的一笔单篇稿费的这天晚上，我失眠了。
当然不是因为钱多烧的，而是白天咖啡喝多了 2021 年最后一篇稿子赚来的稿酬成功让我回想起了成为少数派作者的这一年。
我是 Leslie，一个致力于让没有医学背景的人听懂医生在说啥的科普作者，一年以前，我还只是一个潜水的小透明，现在却混进了少数派的作者群。不过和作者群里两百多个大佬不一样，我不太厉害。在「高效工作」领域，我是个吊车尾，不会编程，不会拆电脑修手机，不会摄影，不会录播客，不会剪视频；在「品质生活」方面，我不会马伽术，不会做厉害的咖啡或是诱人的饭菜，不会种菜，不会俄语，没有惊人的读书量和阅片量，去过的地方也很少。在以上知识技能和经历方面相信很多读者都可以来无情地碾压我。而且我还是个内向的「社恐」。
但你既然已经读到了这篇文章，说明我对这个社区还是有一点点价值的。一直以来我写的多是具体的医学健康话题，这次，我想讲点柔软的，讲讲在成为了少数派作者的这一年，我这样的普通人在坚持写作之后，在网络上终于开始 reach out 之后，有了什么样的改变和思考。希望可以鼓励到和我有着类似渴望或相同困境的读者。
在关系中成长——和编辑的故事
正如《也许你该找个人聊聊》的作者所说，人和人是在关系中成长的。
我向来习惯在现实生活和社交网络中对陌生人保持缄默，而在少数派上写稿、加入作者群，让我产生了新的和人的联结，我认识了好多编辑，有的勇敢，有的善良，有的很宽容，有的很硬汉。在这样的交流中我除了交了十几篇稿…</span>

                    <span>三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。

WTCR是什么
讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。

拿到WTCR冠军有多难？
既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。

摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。

有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。

这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.

在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。

拿到这个冠军有什么意义？
一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。

在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。

中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。

对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。

对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。

而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。

                    <span>看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧
先上个答案：会也不会
我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是16岁拿的驾照17岁买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车，没有国内驾驶经验但是北美交规和限速也差不多。总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的，在两个方面都有足够的经验可以说明问题。
我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。
赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。
公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。
加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…
至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…
总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…

                    <span>一、区位优势
青岛作为2020年北方又一个GDP破万亿的城市，除了旅游产业创造的价值，本身具备工业产业链，信息产业链的基础，海尔、海信等企业创造了一定基数的软件人才基数，一汽青岛，烟台现代等储备了一定当量的制造人才。
自然环境优越宜居，有一定当量的人才基础，房价还不高，很多一线城市被卷怕了的互联网，汽车人才是有可能去安家落户的。


二、北方经济增长点
目前郑州从发展的态势来说，由于交通的区位枢纽优势，整体的工业布局潜力要强于青岛，从GDP增速也可以看到。
尽管青岛作为全国 GDP 排名前十五的城市，后劲在哪里？从产业机构上来说，海尔海信并没有在青岛孵化更多的信息产业。而旅游业对自然环境的要求既是吸引人才的要素也是抑制大规模工业投资的，这可能会成为产业结构质量提升的掣肘。
青岛GDP发展的后劲就在利用人才优势绑定支柱产业创造新基建的产业价值，所以青岛需要高合，需要一个可能性来吸引更多的可能性。


三、高合需要青岛
目前的新势力的模式实际上已经逐渐成型了。
step 1.用国际一线资本实现从0到1的融资，也是背书。这是资源能力的体现。
step2.  合理合规的与地方国有资本促进产业升级的愿望契合并合作，实现区域的自然资源、社会资源、社会资本的整合（如合肥国资委对蔚来的投资，蔚来梦想工厂的落户。）
step3. 好好干，车卖得好了资本市场首先就会有反应，其次是地方的GDP对上下游产业链的拉动效应和人才的虹吸效应（exp:小米作为北京国资委2022年重点项目）
其实不止是汽车产业政府这么做，只是汽车产业动静比较大，对上下游的拉动能力比较强。


四、为什么是中国总部？
其实，还有世界总部、中国总部，软件中心、设计中心、营销中心都可以落户不同的地方，
获取不同区域的融资。这会是新势力融资的一种趋势，落户+产业合作与引进。
只要题材做的对，做的到位，产业链的拉动能够促进地方经济的体量和质量的发展，政府就愿意签约。
作为刚刚做过政府融资的HR。
政府引进产业、签署招商协议，绝对是有要求，有长远眼光，会有非常细致的GDP+税收的拉动要求的，而且这个钱不好拿。
但只要企业能够提供政府想要的价值，并且能够说到做到。分阶段的支持就会到来。


个人看法，青岛只是开始，今后，产业链相对完整、人才相对充裕的准一线，新一线城市会有更多的新势力落户，这符合国家的期待，也符合新基建的发展规律。

                    <span>去年这个时候我写了一篇关于日本威士忌的文章，算是入门科普帖（没看过的可以先戳进去预习一下）。
发布后反响有点出乎意料地好，看来当时对日威有兴趣的人就已经不少，生活也确实需要偶尔喝点小酒放松一下。
所以今天继续来聊聊日威，能为自己喜欢的东西写上一篇攻略性的文章，是一件快乐的事儿。



这一年里日威的热度依旧蹭蹭上涨，现在国内的酒吧或是酒店行政酒廊里没放几瓶日威都撑不起场面，唱衰日威的人又被打脸了。



口说无凭，来看2021年WWA（人称威士忌奥斯卡）的评选结果。日本秩父酒厂的调和威士忌又又又拿奖了，这是它的第四次蝉联。



不过决定写日威第二弹其实还有个契机在。南泊山的老板和菜菜是好朋友，所以我们编辑也会时不时去店里写（摸）稿（鱼），顺便喝咖啡。



前几天正好遇到店里在做特调新品咖啡，场面过于精彩，差点以为自己在看调酒。一问用的是日威，我心里直呼：老板真舍得下本啊！偷偷往柜台看了一眼，用的是知多。
老板说1.0版本用的是苏威，但后来还是决定用日威，毕竟它自带“流量”。



厚脸皮蹭了一杯，入口有一种陌生又熟悉的感觉。酒体强烈的风味并没有盖住咖啡的香气和奶香味，反而让奶咖的味道变得有棱角。一口一口地品，还没过瘾，杯子就见底了。



另外还有两款特调，名字也有意思。
「人间清醒」，高浓度埃塞俄比亚花魁soe，搭配上经过与黄糖融合灼烧过的松井，非常硬核。
「梅空见你」，若鹤梅酒搭配青梅露，加冰雪克，香槟杯做盐边，加入苏打水，最后淋上低浓度的冰的水洗埃塞俄比亚耶加雪菲手冲。
如果你在杭州，可以改天带爱喝酒的朋友一起去品品。日威做特调，是真的下血本。





傍晚走出咖啡店的时候，不得不再次感慨日威确实一年比一年出息。虽然今年在WWA上拿的世界性奖项远不如往年多，但在讨论热度上日威明显已经压了苏威一头。



照这趋势，起步晚于苏格兰、美国、爱尔兰和加拿大的世界第五大…</span>

                    <span>写成都怎么住，我是有发言权的。因为我可以很负责任的说，今天提到的酒店，我去过85%以上。
住的多，自然推荐起来也会更加的有理有据一些。



关于成都怎么住？我是这么看的...
1）如果你是去成都旅行的，也之前是没怎么去过成都的，我会建议你住在成都1环内。
成都绝大部分的景点，都在一环内（或一环边上）。所以如果你住在一环内的话，去哪里旅行可都是很方便的。
绝对绝对不要超过成都的二环。



但如果你是多刷成都，多住住一环外也是不错的。
例如想去熊猫基地的，附近有皇冠假日；想去泡温泉的，金堂有美憬阁；想去青城山的，六善和SLH的青城山尊都不错；都江堰则是有宋品别墅。



2）住新不住旧，一家酒店的最佳入住时间是开业半年到开业六年内。
举个例子，我之前去成都喜欢住君悦，主要是位置好、吃的好、性价比也高，还能让我刷凯悦的SNP。
后来有一次去成都，偶尔住了瑯珀·凯悦臻选后，我发现瑯珀明显更香啊。真不是君悦不好，是瑯珀更好。



3）按照档次来推荐（仅成都市区）
第一档：博舍、钓鱼台
第一点五档：海湾大酒店、尧棠公馆、瑯珀·凯悦臻选
第二档：君悦、希尔顿嘉悦里、华尔道夫、W、丽思、瑞吉、环球中心天堂洲际、费尔蒙、万达瑞华、协信中心希尔顿、成都希尔顿
第三档：其它五星酒店
国宾馆：成都金牛宾馆
老字号：四川锦江宾馆
如果是成都的外围，青城山六善、青城山尊（凯悦悠选旗下），都江堰的宋品别墅（有温泉），官塘安麓、金堂美憬阁（有温泉）、黑龙滩的洲际和英迪格都是不错的。



说完方法论，接下来是推荐：
1）根据周边景点来推荐
成都酒店有一点特别好。就是每个景点边上，总会有一家值得住的酒店。所以在订酒店的时候，你就看你想去哪里浪，然后就订边上的酒店。



宽窄巷子，钓鱼台
在成都，有两家酒店的位置极好。一家是宽窄巷子里的钓鱼台，另外一家是太古里的博舍。都是闹中取静的好去处。
宽窄巷子是…</span>

                    <span>我往年的年终总结（2020，2019， 再早的都没有搬运到这个博客，随着年龄增长似乎对淡忘记忆想要记录的惶恐也少了很多，忘了的就忘了吧）似乎都不能称之为“年终总结”，更像是“编月史”似的流水账。 而且我惊奇地发现拖延症如我过去两年的总结居然都是新年准时发布。今年拖到这么晚，除了难得跨年时候有事干忙着现充没时间写博客外，回想一下更有点潜意识里的逃避——不是因为过去一年过得不好，而是因为过得太好，很多事情要么过于私人不便分享，要么情感方面表达无能不知道要怎么写下来才能准确地记录下来当下的心情。大概因为如此我宁愿先写了个 2021 Matters 的问卷，也没有着手开始写年终总结。不过，既然说是 best year yet，那总还是得记录下来点什么吧。 Achievements 生活 从上一份工作辞职啦 开始 routinely 锻炼和 IF，在任由体重暴增 30 磅的几年之后减回了新的目标体重，身体素质也好了很多，力气也变大很多 虽然辞职期间没有完成之前计划的 side…</span>

enlightening.

I&#x27;m 54 so regardless, can&#x27;t retire for another year but Devorah hit 55
last November and the DOE can really kill ones spirit and grind you down.

Overall I&#x27;ve been pretty happy at Hunter but I&#x27;ve written before about
the fact that I&#x27;ve been feeling some burn out and have been basically
doing 2+ full time jobs myself at Hunter for the past few years and
that&#x27;s just not sustainable.

为了解决Android-App开发以来一直存在的架构设计混乱的问题，谷歌推出了Jetpack-MVVM的全家桶解决方案。作为整个解决方案的核心-LiveData，以其生命周期安全，内存安全等优点，甚至有逐步取代EventBus，RxJava作为Android端状态分发组件的趋势。
官网商城app团队在深度使用LiveData的过程中，也遇到了一些困难，尤其是在LiveData的观察者使用上踩到了不少坑，我们把这些经验在这里做一次总结与分享。
二、Observer到底可以接收多少次回调
2.1 为什么最多收到2个通知
这是一个典型的案例，在调试消息总线的场景时，我们通常会在消息的接收者那里打印一些log日志方便我们定位问题，然而日志的打印有时候也会给我们的问题定位带来一定的迷惑性，可以看下面的例子。
我们首先定义一个极简的ViewModel:
public class TestViewModel extends ViewModel {
    private MutableLiveData currentName;
    public MutableLiveData getCurrentName() {
        if (currentName &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
            currentName &#x3D; new MutableLiveData();
        }
        return currentName;
    }
}

然后看下我们的activity代码；
public class JavaTestLiveDataActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
    private TestViewModel model;
 
    private String test&#x3D;&quot;1234…</span>

命名空间 （Namespace）
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-11968
Java 可以通过类名调用 Class 的静态方法或者静态变量，这无形中提供了一种 namespace 机制，方便快速索引某个常量或方法。 Kotlin 虽然鼓励开发者使用顶级方法替代 Util 类，但当这样的顶级方法太多时，我们也希望有类似的 namespace 机制出现。
目前常见的 workaround 是使用 object 类替代静态方法，例如
object DisplayUtil{
    fun dip2px(context:Context, px:Float) {
        ...
    }
}

Kotlin 标准库的 Delegates.notNull 、协程库的 Dispatchers.Default 等都是这样定义的，这种方式缺点是需要额外创建一个 ob…</span>

PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛
前言
回想小时候，一到冬天就开始期盼着学校快点放寒假，期盼着快点过年。因为过年有放不完的鞭炮与吃不完的糖果，犹记得那时候我的口袋里总是充满着各式各样的糖果。今天就以糖果为主题，实现糖果雨来啦这个互动小游戏。
效果展示
开始引导页面
糖果收集页面
收集结束页面










实现细节
具体实现其实也很简单，主要分为3块内容：
开始引导页面：提供开始按钮来告诉用户如何开始，3秒倒计时动画，让用户做好准备。
糖果收集页面：自动生成糖果并从上往下掉落，用户点击糖果完成收集（糖果消失 &amp; 糖果收集总数加一）。
收集结束页面：告诉用户一共收集了多少糖果，提供再玩一次按钮入口。
引导动画
如果单单是一个静态页面，提供文字来提醒用户如何开始游戏，会略显单调，所以我加了一些自定义View动画，模拟点击动作，来达到提醒用户作用。
利用三个动画组合在一起同时执行，从达到该效果，分别是：
手指移动去点击动画。
点击后的水波纹动画。
点击后糖果+1动画。
这里我们以 点击后糖果+1动画 举例。
我们先建一个res/anim/candy_add_anim.xml文件，如下：



    

    

然后在指定的View中执行该动画，如下：
binding.candyAddOneTv.apply {
    val animation &#x3D; AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(context, R.anim.candy_add_anim)
    startAnimation(animation)
}

糖果的生成
从效果展示图中也可以看出，糖果的样式是各式各样的且其位置坐标是随机的。

                    <span>写在前面
距离上一篇文章跟我一起开发商业级IM（3）—— 长连接稳定性之连接及重连发布的时间，大概已有一年多，先跟大家说声抱歉。主要是因为工作太忙，业务需求过多，没办法专心写博客。先立个Flag：IM系列文章一定会坚持写完，同时Github项目也会逐步完善，敬请期待。
Shine，同时也希望自己借此机会重新拾起写博客和开源项目的激情，废话少说，我们直接开始吧。
Shine是什么？
基于Retrofit二次封装的网络请求库。通过统一封装、高内聚、低耦合、灵活配置、高度扩展等特性使Android网络请求更简单。
版本

Java
Retrofit+RxJava
Kotlin
Retrofit+Coroutine
Shine能做什么？
支持的请求

GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
支持动态BaseUrl
支持自定义Response Model（不同数据结构）
支持自定义Response Parser（响应数据解析器）
支持自定义Cipher（请求/响应数据加解密）
支持自定义Content Type
支持异步/同步请求
统一的IApiService，新增接口时无需改动IApiService
统一的异常处理，方便在接口请求失败时获取相关错误信息
为什么这样做？
不统一的Response Model
日常开发中，大家应该会经常遇到Response Model不统一的情况，例如服务端A返回的数据格式为：code、msg、data，服务端B返回的数据格式为：errCode、errMsg、result，服务端C返回的数据格式为status、message、data等，甚至即使是同一个服务端提供的接口，也可能存在不同接口返回不同数据格式，客户端兼容起来异常困难。在Shine中，通过自定义Response Model及Response Parser即可轻松解决此问题，同时支持配置全局R…</span>

大家好 ，我是加勒比考斯。
很高兴再次和大家见面~
前言
笔者目前有4台旧的笔记本电脑，而且这4台还一直都在使用，来回切换发现这几台屏幕色差真的不是一般的大啊，而且后续笔者还要做视频，还要换屏幕，所以咬了咬牙，直接在狗东下单了一个Datacolor的红蜘蛛校色仪，后面准备来一个一个进行校正。

第一台是2020年MacBook Air M1丐版，出差修图剪视频使用，不得不说苹果的优化做的真的好，修图剪视频没有比这个更合适的了。
第二台是是17年买的一个戴尔游侠游戏本，这个游戏本我拿来打英雄联盟，一个8年的英雄联盟老玩家，每个周都要来几把排位，现在还是青铜段位混，也是丢脸了。
第三台是一个是19年买的荣耀笔记本MagicBook，这台主要是媳妇儿用来看剧用，用起来简单轻便，而且还可以触屏，媳妇儿一直很喜欢。
第四台是公司发的惠普战66笔记本电脑，公司全部都是用的自己的办公套件，想用自己的电脑很难，只能用公司发的电脑。
这4台电脑是每天都在用，但是来回切换后对比后发现这个色差特别严重，尤其是那台游戏本是采用了的TN屏幕，戴尔游戏本屏幕素质真的是创业界新低，而且当初还是7000块钱买的。
 
接下来，考斯准备使用校色仪让几块屏幕的色彩尽量统一，同时也会介绍红蜘蛛校色仪的使用方法。
 
Datacolor的校色仪目前主要分为两个系列，分别是红蜘蛛和蓝蜘蛛，两者在核心校色方面并没有太多差别，都可以正常使用，但是如果你是专业的设计师或者视频工作者，那么推荐选择红蜘蛛，它拥有更多专业向的功能，测试和分析工具也更齐全。

大家需要注意的一点，Datacolor红蜘蛛的色度计不可以直…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(0 min)</span>
                    <span>这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：
1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。
“盐者，百肴之将”[1]，意思就是盐为&quot;百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。
同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。

比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。
比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。
比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。


另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。
2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性
人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。
可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。
糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。
3. 盐的可获得性高于糖
盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。
大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。
而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。

综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。

梅里雪山的主峰卡瓦格博海拔6740米，是云南的最高点，也是最被尊崇的藏传佛教神山之一，又被藏人称作“太子雪山”，至今梅里雪山所有重要山峰均没有登顶成功的记录。

                    <span>没有人会选择售价三、四十一晚的廉价旅馆。
如果不是穷游学生、迫于生计的求职者，走投无路的过路人，几乎鲜有人在这停留。破旧，肮脏，危险，狭小似乎是他们的代言词，敬而远之。
蜿蜒曲折，爬楼后的别样风景
个高的人想要上这样一个台阶非低头不可
一般来说，每一家小旅馆都有一条黑暗曲折只能允许一个人通行的小道，越往上，越黑暗。
廉价旅馆似乎都藏于这样的深巷之中
当你提着行李箱只身费九牛二虎之力走上这三折台阶，等待你的是个用玻璃围起来的小窗。只需朝着小窗吼上三四遍，老板自会从你未曾发觉的地方突然现身。
进一个巷口并不算困难，困难的是爬上这狭窄曲折的楼梯
大多数的时候，小旅馆的老板都在你看不见的窗口后面睡觉。有人唤的时候才会从搭建在小窗下的简易弹簧床上忽然坐起，然后一脸睡意的询问你单间还标间。
小旅馆的老板一般都藏在小玻璃窗口的后面
除了传统的身份人脸验证核对，老板会从抽屉里再掏出一本破旧小本，记下你的入住时间，预定平台和缴纳押金数额。一般来说，这种小旅馆的押金都比较少，几十块钱给个意思就行，全凭老板心情。
一台摆在大厅里的电脑就是个接待台了
办理好了一切，给到你的房卡也不过是一串绑着号码牌的钥匙串。好一点的小旅馆会有一个钥匙牌，直接插入门把手下端，进门之后还可以靠这个钥匙牌供电。
推门而进便是床铺，尽管空间狭小，但已是豪华高配
一般小旅馆的格局都不会很大，单人间也就是个睡觉的地儿。厕所和洗澡的地方一般不太会有单独的。晚上想洗个澡，内急想蹲个坑，只能出门右拐，走下一层楼到楼道尽头的洗漱池那，和所有住在这的人一起洗漱，一起蹲坑。
单人间一般没有独卫、电视，一张床便是全部
大多数人住这种旅馆都会担心卫生问题。旅馆里的公用厕所和洗漱间大多陈旧泛黄，尽管蹲坑的时候你得小心翼翼避开所有在地上的不堪。
蹲下来的时候面对的是一堆无痛人流医院广告，但基本的日常使用总是没什么问题的。不禁心里暗戳戳想到，“三十块钱，又要什么自行车呢？”
行走江湖，入住后的旅馆冷暖。
开在大学城附近的小旅馆倒是设备齐全
尽管是三十块的小旅馆，该有的倒是一个不差。电视，空调，WiFi，有的甚至还配上了麻将桌。只不过想要使用空调，多半得再交个十块钱，才能从老板那拿到遥控。
贴满墙纸似乎也能感受到老板的用心布置
电视别指望太好的显示效果，能响个声就算万幸，大多数甚至都没办法搜到频道。狭小的空间，想要在床上伸个懒腰甚至都是一件奢侈的事情。
在这种小旅馆里，不一定所有的床单都是白色
在这三十块一晚上的小旅馆，床单到底有没有一晚一换，估计也只有老板知道了。只要不是肉眼可见的肮脏，基本也就不太会每天更换了。
有的老板大概也担心你觉得旅馆太过于冷清，所以墙上倒也总能看到一些“温馨”画面。
墙壁上贴满荷花似乎白墙也就没有那么冰冷了
老板倒也直言不讳，“被套这东西哪有那个劲送专门的公司去洗，我们都是自己手洗。你以为送过去洗的有多干净？他到底给你洗了没他敢给你保证么，但我就敢保证我100%给你洗了。” 
格外温馨好看的床单，让人感觉像在家一样
大门和晾台布满了刚刚换下来的床单枕被套，在几条拉起来的废旧电线上还挂着刚刚入住在此的旅客换洗下来的衣物。
在门口晾晒的床单被套
南昌的夏天热的可怕，在天台暴晒一会儿倒是干起来很快。住在这儿的旅客也大多是来昌打工的讨生活者。在这暂住几天，找着工作就去工地上班，能省一点就是一点。
迫于生计，躺下后的片刻舒缓
粉色调的布置又是否觉得温馨
大多数的时候，想找一个安静且舒适的小旅馆并不是一件幸运的事儿。学生时代的我要想出去看看，住和交通，永远是最大的开销。廉价旅馆便是唯一的选择了。
尽管床铺就正对厕所，但有个独卫的单间已经很好了
用钥匙打开木门的第一眼就被惊讶了，与其说这是一间房，倒不如直接说是楼梯下的一个小空间。
隔音什么的也就基本不存在了。隔板那边的住客玩了一晚上消消乐，我竟然也难以置信的听了一晚上的Unbelievable。
房间与房间挨的这么近，发出点什么声响对门一准知道
彻夜难眠是在小旅馆常会发生的事儿，毕竟除了隔音糟糕会让你难以入睡，还有你搞不明白到底是什么的东西留下的床单印记让你整夜直犯恶心。

住进廉价小旅馆的人，多半是因为经济紧张才不得已选择。

拎着行李箱爬上那个幽暗狭窄的小楼梯时就注定今晚没法睡的安稳。可是，在没钱没工作的焦躁绝望中，又有多少睡在这的人会真的安稳入睡呢？

                    <span>春节「炸场子」那肯定非大红色系莫属了
不过大红色也分不同的色温色调，我来推荐几个我自己很喜欢的大红色系口红，唇膏唇釉，哑光亮面都有，应该会有你喜欢/适合你的一款
（为了好看唇周有磨皮美白，但是嘴唇本嘴是没有磨皮没有调色的，手上的试色是啥都没调过的原图，仅供参考）
阿玛尼红管唇釉 #405

最出圈的烂番茄色，老网红了，但是真的很漂亮，我用过不少烂番茄色，用来用去还是405最好看，每年秋冬都会拿出来用

厚涂非常浓郁，非常显白，整个脸都亮了的感觉，跟毛衣大衣绝配，不成膜会沾杯，但是不用担心掉色，因为掉色之后底色也还在，基本就是薄涂的效果，而405薄涂也很好看！


NARS黑管唇釉 Light my fire

也是橘调的红色，但是比阿玛尼405更亮，差不多是非荧光的橘红色里最亮的一个，非常抓人眼球，用来「炸场子」非常合适哈哈哈

处于染唇液和唇釉之间的那种质地，很轻薄但是遮盖力显色度绝了，干的快会成膜，在嘴上扒的很牢，吃饭啥的不会掉，注意卸妆的时候用眼唇卸妆液多敷会儿

资生堂 银座细管口红 #220

又是一个偏橘的红，不过这个是粉橘调，很像是大红灯笼点亮之后的那种红色，膏体带一点点金闪，但是上嘴之后看不出有闪片，有很自然的光泽感

薄涂粉调比较明显，很嫩，挺日常的，厚涂橘调就明显了，虽然是唇膏但是涂的时候很丝滑，很润不拔干，不过持久度也一般


YSL金圆管唇膏 #83

终于到蓝调的红了，不过黄皮也没问题，不是玫红那种，很妙的一个颜色，薄涂是水红，厚涂棕调就出来了，比草莓红更知性，比砖红更活泼

是改版之后的新质地，不假润了，膏体也带细闪，上最看不出来，但是光泽感很漂亮，显得嘴很饱满

MAC 子弹头 Cockney

标准的草莓红，膏体带金闪，上嘴也能看到一点点闪，青春活泼，跟YSL 83相比更适合年轻的妹子，玫调更明显一点，不太适合黄黑皮


丝芙兰 哑光唇釉 #01

虽然叫樱桃红，但是我觉得这个是一个非常非常正的大红色，不偏橘也不偏玫，哑光丝绒感很漂亮，干了之后不沾杯，持久度也很不错
如果你不知道自己适合哪种大红，就选这个正红，厚涂不会出错的

                    <span>在jetpack体系中 livedata的角色纯纯粹粹是个桥接器，DataSource中获取到数据，然后由viewmodel进行逻辑处理，最后被livedata.postValue到view层，唯一的价值是绑定了lifecycle， 只在页面活跃（start）的时候接受数据
官方的一篇介绍可以参考：从 LiveData 迁移到 Kotlin 数据流 - 掘金
对于初学者来说使用lieveData的好处是足够简单和相对安全
引入flow主要因为以下几点：
具有更友好的API，学习成本较低
跟Kotlin协程、LiveData结合更紧密，Flow能够转换成LiveData，在ViewModel中直接使用
结合协程的作用域，当协程被取消时，Flow也会被取消，避免内存泄漏
flow库隶属于kotlin， livedata属于Android， 拜托Android平台的限制对于未来跨平台发展有利
【flow是个冷数据流】
所谓冷流，即下游无消费行为时，上游不会产生数据，只有下游开始消费，上游才开始产生数据。
而所谓热流，即无论下游是否有消费行为，上游都会自己产生数据。
下边通过一个经典场景详细描述下flow（单纯的flow，而stateFlow会在后续章节中讲解）的使用
案例：一个菜谱应用app中，我想在一个页面展示一个列表（recyclerview） ，此列表的每个item是个子列表，子列表依次为
计划菜谱列表；
收藏菜谱列表；
根据食材筛选的菜谱列表；
根据食材获取用户偏好的菜谱列表；
如图

四个子列表需要四个接口来获取，组装好后来刷新最后的列表
其中每个列表都有可能是空，是emptylist的话这行就不显示了，因为四个接口数据量大小不同，所以不会同一时间返回，同时又要保障这四个子列表按要求的顺序来展示。

Linux Kernel 5.12.1
ps | grep 关键字

学习Linux都会知道上面这样一行命令，中间的竖线其实是匿名管道，将前一个命令的输出，作为后一个命令的输入。
实质这里执行了跨进程，本文分析一下。
涉及多少个进程？
先说结论，在shell下执行ps|grep，涉及shell、ps和grep三个进程
查看当前shell的进程id：
echo $$

输出当前shell的pid是3347
再查看当前的进程列表，打印出进程的父进程id：
ps o pid, ppid, comm | grep &quot;&quot;

PID    PPID COMMAND
989     968 gdm-x-session
991     989 Xorg
1091     989 gnome-session-b
3347    1947 bash
5018    3347 ps
5019    3347 grep

末尾三个进程就是涉及到的进程，其中ps进程和grep进程的父进程都是shell，因此是shell进程fork出了两个进程。
管道
ps进程数据传递到grep进程，使用了匿名管道。管道的创建，使用了下面的pipe函数：
#include 

int pipe(int fd[2]);

pipe函数通过参数填充返回两个文件描述符，fd[0]是读，fd[1]是写，在fd[1]写入将会在fd[0]读取。

管道的原理本文先不讨论，简单说它是内核的一块内存。
到这个时候，创建的管道还只是一个进程里的事，没有起到进程间通讯的作用。
父子进程之间的通信

上图描述了父进程使用fork创建子进程并使用管道通讯的原理
进程使用task_struct结构描述，进程复制调用的是fork，进程持有的所有fd都会复制一份
父进程使用pipe函数创建一个管道，fd[0]和fd[1]…</span>

一、HashMap的诞生
1.1 数组
数组：一片物理上连续的大小确定的储存空间。
好处：根据下标快速的查找和修改里面的内容。
缺点：大小确定，无法修改。添加新的元素或者删除元素比较麻烦。

数组的静态初始化
        //数组实现方式一：
        //数据类型 数组名称[] &#x3D; {值, 值,…}
        String str[] &#x3D; {&quot;移动端&quot;,&quot;Android&quot;,&quot;iOS&quot;};
        System.out.println(str.length);//三个元素
        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
运行结果是一样的。
&quot;E:\Android\Android StudioO\jre\bin\java.exe&quot;...
3
移动端
Android
iOS

如果我想再添加两个新元素(Java、Kotlin)，那么使用数组就不合适了，这时候顺序表就出现了。
1.2 顺序表
顺序表：以数组的形式保存的线性表，物理上连续、逻辑上连续、大小可以动态增加。(如：ArrayList)
顺序表用的频率远远高于数据。用肯定都会用，咱们看看源码。
public class ArrayList extends AbstractList
        implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
{
    transient Object[] elementData;//存储 ArrayList 元素的数组缓冲区。
    private int size;//ArrayList 的大小
    public ArrayList() {

                    <span>Gradle 是每个 Android 同学都逃不开的一个话题。
你是否看到别人的 Gradle 文件干净又卫生？而自己的又是一团乱麻🏷
不用怕,本篇将结合我的开发日常，将一些常用的操作分享出来，希望可以帮到像我一样不怎么会[玩]Gradle 的同学，相信会对大家有所帮助。
模板代码提取
这是最基础的操作了，对于一个普通 model.gradle ,默认的配置如下：

如果我们每个 model 都这样写，那岂不是很麻烦，那么让我们提取通用代码：
优化步骤
新建一个 gradle 文件，命名为 xxx.gradle ,复制上述 model 里的配置，放到你的项目中,可以自定义修改一些通用内容，在其他model 中依赖即可,如下所示：
这是一个播放器model
// 这就是刚才新建的默认gradle文件,
// 注意：如果你的default.gradle是在项目目录下，请使用../,如果仅在app下，请使用./
apply from: &quot;../default.gradle&quot;
import xxx.*

android {
  // 用于隔离不同model的资源文件
    resourcePrefix &quot;lc_play_&quot;
}


dependencies {
    compileOnly project(path: &#x27;:common&#x27;)
    api xxx
}

上述的 android{} , dependencies{}
其内部的内容都会在 default.gradle 的基础上叠加，对于唯一的键值对，会进行替换。
定义统一的config配置
在项目中，你是如何去写你的版本号等其他默认配置呢？

对于一个新项目，其默认的配置如下所示，每次新创建 model ,也需要定义其默认参数，如果每次都直接在这里去改动，那么如果版本变化，意味着我们需要修改多次，这并不是我们想看到…</span>

由于 HAP（HomeKit Accessories Protocol）的开放性质1，配合 HomeBridge / HomeAssistant 庞大的插件库，几乎做到了万物皆可 HomeKit 的程度。今天我们就来把家中的 PlayStation 游戏机的唤醒和休眠加入到 「家庭」应用中并控制。

本文以 HomeBridge 为例，HomeBridge 运行在 Ubuntu 系统的树莓派上。安装和使用 HomeBridge 请参考这篇文章：HomeBridge 操作指南：从零开始，将你的米家设备接入 Homekit
本次接入的原理是根据 Github 上开源的 PlayStation 唤醒软件进行配置，再接入到 HomeBridge 调用运行配置好的唤醒软件。从而达到曲线救国的 PlayStation 的 HomeKit 化，接下来我们就分步骤进行安装与配置。
安装控制软件
本方法使用 playactor 控制软件来操控 PlayStation 系统。由于 PlayStation 并不支持传统的 WoL ，现在有的方法原理都是基于索尼自家的 PS Remote Play 这款软件的原理进行开发的。

根据 playactor 项目的文档，本项目支持 PS4 的全部操作和 PS5 的部分操作。在加入 HomeKit 之后我们仅需要用到 Wake 与 Standby 两个指令即可。

我还记得自己第一次见到 Surface Laptop Go 是在北京三里屯的一家顺电。对自己的 MacBook Pro 早已审美疲劳的我，说实话，对 Surface 系列的设计一直都是十分欣赏的。3:2 的 12.4 英寸屏幕比例、舒适的键盘和触控板，以及触摸屏 —— Surface Laptop Go 符合一切我对于上网本的期待。只不过，当时的我只是简简单单的欣赏，并没有什么购买欲。
情况在今年发生了改变。首先是，我把用了多年的 2016 款 13 英寸 MacBook Pro 出掉了，换了 M1 的 Mac mini 作为日常使用的 Mac 机器。这是因为，尽管 MacBook Pro 十分便携，它的性能早已跟不上我的需要了。至于移动办公的需求，单位配发的 Dell Latitude 7390 实际上体验尚可，如果它不是那么快就坏掉了的话。
LOL，线过于杂乱，请勿介意
如今的轻薄笔记本，其实有不少的选择。一来，MacBook Air 因为配备了 M1 处理器而变得性能强劲且续航优秀；二来，在 Windows 阵营，联想小新、小米、华为等一众国产品牌推出的轻薄款笔记本无论是性能还是价格都还不错。至于我为什么最终选择了 Surface Laptop Go，主要原因是这样的：首先，我也已经提到了我对这款笔记本的设计钟爱有加。考虑到 12.4 英寸 3:2 的屏幕，它看起来小巧精致，但是在内容的显示上倒是也毫不含糊，相比 16:9 或者 16:10 的传统比例，能够显示的内容更多。其次，最近对于 Excel 的高需求，让我无法安心使…</span>

                    <span>21年颇为戏剧和魔幻，事情太多；上下半年的行业巨变，好像经历了两个年头：迟迟没有想好应该怎么做个小结。
回头看，投资似乎是一个不错的固定视角，贯穿全年，总算有点话讲。

20年：年终小结：从跨端到内容平台
19年：年终小结，赛道思考与机会判断

一
彼时还没有元宇宙，我在20年Epic Games的哲学与抱负里把metaverse翻作“元世界”（起名的本事真差）。21年开年clubhouse爆红，给metaverse浇了一把新油。
一场上海游戏圈大佬们的秉烛夜谈吸引了无数人在clubhouse围观，Dash老板那句“腾讯的社交不过是纸老虎”言犹在耳（笑），但Steven老板很客气、中肯地作了总结发言。末了，我们听出来了：腾讯心里只有育碧、动视之流；眼里，是半个米哈游。
但在国内，其实还有字节在腾讯眼皮上跳动。


二
都知道字节要做游戏，但in house自建就得尊重内容产业的规律，大力出不了奇迹；于是字节开始一路买买买，从拿产品到买管线，并且高价搅动市场行情。
所以20年下半年开始，腾讯就全面加强在国内的游戏投资，21年尤甚，实行“三不原则”，不干涉经营决策、不主导项目、不寻求发行权。但很多权益上要求排“他”，不要和那谁玩。
神仙打架，跑马圈地，其他厂商也坐不住，只能纷纷跟注。卷起来了，有人就出更高的价钱，拿更少的权益，比口袋深度，卷死你们。战略投资人纷纷退化成了财务投资人，甚至不在乎财务回报的财务投资人（?）；财务机构一看，咱们起跑线一致了，也抓住机会纷纷入局。一时间好不热闹。
当然，钱不迷路，总有人赚。别管是面子还是里子，天底下只有你情我愿的买卖。win-win，都赢麻了。


三
不好说各家成绩单，但加总算下来过去一年超过200个团队拿到钱吧。
对买家来说，有人拿到二次元最后的门票，国产3A的门面，有人拿到成熟的管线、海量的用户，其实价格不重要。
更重要…</span>
