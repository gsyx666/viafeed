Although I don&#x27;t have that much of professional work experience, I&#x60;ve done a few projects that verifies my skills.
The question is how can I start my freelance career(or corporate career) giving that internship opportunities hardly exist in my country (Egypt) and nearly everyone want seniors with 5+ yrs. It&#x60;s really disappointing.</span>

Like many other industries, the world of sales and marketing is experiencing a significant change - ‘tectonic shifts. Thanks to the cutting edge digital infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence (one of the advances of the Fourth Industrial Revolution) has a global footprint, I.e. in every industry.

Welcome to the AWS open source newsletter #114. This weeks new open source projects feature a variety of community related projects such as &quot;instance-scheduler&quot; a tool to help you schedule AWS resources, &quot;libaws&quot; an opinionated tool that helps you simplify creation and deletion of some AWS resources, &quot;elasticspot&quot; a nice tool to help you reassign elastic IPs, and &quot;auto-close-aws-accounts&quot; that allows you to close AWS accounts if you are using AWS Organisations. We have plenty of other projects such as &quot;amazon-ec2-spot-interrupter&quot; a nice tool that provides a command line tool to trigger spot interruption notifications, and others that help you work with AWS Glue, simplify deployments of SageMaker notebooks, and others.

Today I’m going to recap all the most important announcements around DevOps made by Microsoft at Build 2002
As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let&#x27;s just continue :)

To me, Everything started with this Twitter thread and from that article, by Ben Kehoe:
 
When dealing with CLI or SDKs, we are already used to putting IAM credentials in the .aws/credentials file.
However, as correctly stated cluttering the credentials file with many credentials is not the right move to make.
This article aims to overview what IAM Principals are and the better ways to manage your programmatic access to AWS.
Moreover, we&#x27;ll focus on the Credential Process. We&#x27;ll see that we can polish our local usage of AWS Principals with it.
Let&#x27;s dig into this journey through AWS authorization systems.

I recently got a notification about my 5 years on dev.to. It hit me really hard, as I was not active here once I switched careers from scientist to software engineer. 
Back then, dev.to was a startup, I was amidst going from being a Technology Wizard at a high tech perovskite solar cell technology company towards my own startup, which is kinda in zombie state now - we did invent smart functional materials that can be used for a Black Panther suit, amongst other things. 
Some year later, I was freelancing and looking for a job. 3 and a half years ago, landed my current job. Now - I&#x27;m here.
Whats your story?</span>

                              <span>Time estimation in software engineering seems to be the most difficult task.
Time estimation becomes a bit easier for well-managed projects where most of the design decisions have been made and there is enough internal tooling and resources. But it is still not perfect. Things become more difficult for teams with limited resources and external pressure on deadlines. More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.
When it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge. It becomes worse if there is no external motivation or revenue potential for the project. Building something for fun or learning might end up in an unfinished project that never sees a launch day.
Side projects should be straightforward by design…</span>

                              <span>what should I know before learning Java


Well, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)

I am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. 
If you are a beginner, please don&#x27;t use any kind of IDE.
 IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. 
It is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. 
As using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. 
So you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. 
This learning method is slow but very effective. 
Although you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. 
You can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.

                              <span>在新安装 Fedora后，安装多媒体编码器来播放音频和视频是第一件要事。


在这篇简单的教程中，我们将看到如何在 Fedora 36 工作站中从 RPM Fusion 软件包存储库安装多媒体编码器。

介绍

很多多媒体编码器要么是闭源的，要么是非自由的，因此出于法律的原因，它们没有包含在 Fedora Linux 的默认存储库中。

幸运的是，一些第三方存储库提供了受限的和非自由的多媒体编码器、软件包和库。一个流行的社区驱动的第三方存储库是 RPM Fusion。

如果你想在你的 Fedora 桌面环境中播放大多数的音频或视频格式的文件，你应该从 RPM Fusion 中安装必要的多媒体编码器，如下所述。

在 Fedora Linux 中安装多媒体编码器

确保你已经在你的 Fedora 机器中安装了 RPM Fusion 存储库。如果你尚未添加它，参考下面的链接来在 Fedora 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库：


如何在 Fedora、RHEL 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库


在启用 RPM Fusion 存储库后，在你的 Fedora 系统中依次运行下面的命令来安装多媒体编码器：

$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-\*,good-\*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude&#x3D;gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel


如果上面的命令不工作，尝试下面的命令：

$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-*,good-*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude&#x3D;gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel


$ sudo dnf install lame* --exclude&#x3D;lame-devel


$ sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia


这三个命令安装了非常多的东西，可以在你的 Fedora 系统中播放所有的音频和视频格式的文件。

安装多媒体播放器

一些流行的媒体播放器，诸如 VLC、Celluloid、SMplayer 和 Plex-media-palyer 等等，将提供所有需要的编码器。你不需要将它们全部都安装，只要任意一两个就足够了。下面给出安装这些播放器的命令：

$ sudo dnf install vlc


VLC 预装在很多 Linux 发行版中，它是一个标准的用于播放各种媒体类型文件的媒体播放器。

SMplayer 是 Mplayer 的前端，它被认为是 VLC 的最佳替代品。

$ sudo dnf install smplayer


如果你想要更强大是多媒体体验，安装 Plex-media-player。

$ sudo dnf install plex-media-player


这将不仅为你提供 H264、H265、VP8 和 VP9 编码器（均带硬件支持），它也将启用一种更高效的编码器 AV1（又名 AV01）。你可以使用 AV1 Beta Launch Playlist 来测试你的浏览器是否支持这个编码器。

它们中的一些播放器也可以作为 flatpak 格式的应用程序来使用。如果与传统的软件包管理器相比，你更喜欢 flatpak 格式的应用程序，你可以安装它们。现在大多数的 Linux 发行版都支持开箱即用的 flatpak 格式的应用程序

为安装 VLC 的 flatpak 版本，运行：

$ flatpak install vlc


可选 - 安装 FFmpeg

FFmpeg 是一个功能强大的多媒体框架，它可用于编码、解码、转码、混流、解混流、录制、音轨、过滤等，以及播放各种类型的媒体文件。你可以通过在你的系统上安装 FFmpeg 来获取相应的解码器。


如何在 Linux 中安装 FFmpeg


希望这有帮助。

                              <span>5 月 17 日，谷歌推出了一项新计划，该计划向谷歌云用户策划并提供经过安全审查的开源包选项，以保护开源软件供应链。该公司在一篇 博文 中宣布了这项名为 “安心开源软件Assured Open Source Software” 的新服务。在博文中，谷歌云安全和隐私部门产品经理 Andy Chang 强调了保障开源软件的一些问题，并强调了谷歌对开源的承诺。

“开发者社区、企业及政府对软件供应链风险的意识越来越强，”Chang 写道，并以去年的 log4j 重大漏洞为例。“谷歌仍是开源代码最大的维护者、贡献者和使用者之一，并深入参与了帮助开源软件生态系统更加安全的工作。”

据谷歌称，“安心开源软件”服务将让云客户能够访问谷歌的大量软件审计知识。另据其称，所有通过该服务提供的开源软件包也在公司内部使用，该公司会定期检查和分析其漏洞。

谷歌目前正在审核的 550 个重要开源库的清单可以在 GitHub 上找到。虽然这些库都可以独立于谷歌下载，但该计划将呈现通过谷歌云提供的审核版本，防止开发者破坏广泛使用的开放源码库。这项服务现在处于预先体验阶段，将在 2022 年第三季度准备好进行更广泛的消费者测试。

谷歌的声明只是广大行业努力加强开源软件供应链的安全的一部分，这份努力得到了拜登政府的支持。今年 1 月，美国国土安全部和美国网络安全与基础设施安全局的代表与美国一些主要 IT 公司的高管会面，研究 log4j 漏洞之后的开源软件安全问题。此后，有关公司在最近的一次峰会上承诺提供超过 3000 万美元的资金，以改善开源软件的安全问题。

除了现金，谷歌还在投入工程时间来确保供应链的安全。该公司已宣布发展一个“开源维护小组Open Source Maintenance Crew”，该团队将与库维护人员合作以提高安全性。

每一代内核都包含了令人兴奋的技术进步，Linux 内核 5.18 也不例外。

Linux 内核 5.18 有哪些变化呢？

本次我们可以看到，内核针对雷蛇外设硬件、苹果妙控键盘和 AMD 显卡增强了支持，还有一些网络、核心和安全方面的更新。

新的雷蛇驱动

说到游戏装备，Linux 的硬件支持亟待更新。

目前存在一些开源驱动程序的变通解决方案。但是这些方案不具有普适性，适配和支持较少。

正如 Phoronix 所发现的，Linux 内核 5.18 中一同发布了一个新的雷蛇 HID 驱动程序，它适配了雷蛇黑寡妇蜘蛛键盘，并修复了宏键此前存在的问题。

此外，这个驱动程序应该也有助于解决其他雷蛇硬件的问题。

AMD 显卡特性 FreeSync 模式被默认开启



虽然对 FreeSync 视频的支持足够好，但这只是改善 FreeSync 显示器用户体验的一个临时解决方案。

现在在 Linux 内核 5.18 版本中这一显示模式已被默认启用，用户无需调整任何设置即可使用 FreeSync（见更新日志）。

显卡驱动更新

针对当前和未来的 AMD 显卡的驱动进行了改进。此外，支持英特尔 Arch 图形处理器和英特尔 Alder Lake N 的工作也取得了一些进展。

更高刷新率的 DisplayPort 也在这一个版本中得到支持。

从 C89 标准升级到 C11 标准（GNU11）



在 Linux 内核中使用的是 C89 C 语言标准，在当前已经稍显老旧并且缺失了许多十分必要的新特性。

考虑到目前的编译器版本 GCC 5.1 的要求，从 Linux 内核 5.18 开始决定用 C11 标准来取代它。

网络优化

Linux 内核 5.18 增加了对新的无线硬件的支持，这包括联发科 MT7916、MT7921U 和博通 BCM43454/6。



针对移动设备的改进也包括对英特尔 M.2 WWAN 卡的支持。

Realtek W89 驱动现在支持 AP 模式、6GHz 频段并增加了硬件扫描功能。

在配置 IPv6 和其他各种协议方面，通过一系列的改进提升了性能。

你可以在 Linux 内核 5.18 中网络方面的变更提交中了解所有情况（包括对驱动 API、协议和一些核心功能的改进）。

USB 改进

Xen USB 驱动程序进行了改进，以抵御恶意主设备，USB DWC3 驱动程序也支持了更多的硬件类型。

其他改进详见 更新日志。

增强对苹果键盘以及平板的支持



当前版本针对苹果妙控键盘（包含第一代型号）的使用体验进行了优化。

改进了功能键映射、键盘背光事件，以及 2021 款的妙控键盘通过 USB 连接时报告电池水平的能力。

Linux 内核 5.18 改进了输入处理，在平板电脑上输入将变得更为容易。

硬件相关的改进详见 更新日志。

ARM 架构芯片的支持（特斯拉 FSD，树莓派 Zero 2 W）



Linux 内核 5.18 现在支持特斯拉的全套自动驾驶 SoC。三星工程师将其贡献到了 Linux 内核上游。

其他芯片支持包括高通骁龙 625/632，以及三星 Exynos 850/7885。

你还会发现 Linux 内核 5.18 支持了树莓派 Zero 2 W，而同时去除了旧的硬件/主板的支持。详见 更新日志。

你可以参考 官方更新日志 和 Linus Torvald 的官方公告获取更多信息。

如何安装 Linux 内核 5.18？

你可以在 Linux Kernel Archives 网站上找到最新版本的内核。你可以下载 Tarball 以进行测试。你也可以参照我们的 Linux 内核升级指南 获取帮助。

如果不想自己编译它，你可以稍等几周，等 Linux 发行版们把它推到仓库。

Agile transformation happens at three levels: team agile, product agile, and organization agile. Helping your team convert to agile is the first and fundamental step in agile transformation, and with good reason. Until you get your people on board with agile, the product of all their hard work can&#x27;t be agile.
Getting to team agile can be difficult, however. Teams new to agile cite these two factors as common obstacles:

In this final part of the series, I look at Rifkin&#x27;s thoughts regarding logistics (moving, storing, sharing) internet, and other economic sectors.

When trying to familiarize yourself with someone else&#x27;s project, you usually appreciate the comments left behind that help you understand the meaning of their code. In the same way, whenever you are programming, whether for yourself or for others, it is good practice to comment your own code. All programming languages offer a special syntax to mark a word, a line, or a whole section as a comment. Those areas are then ignored by the compiler or interpreter when the source code is processed. 
Comments don&#x27;t take the place of documentation, but there is a way to use your comments to produce documentation easily. Meet Doxygen, an open source tool for generatin…</span>

Vely is a tool for writing web and command-line applications in C. Vely combines high performance and the low footprint associated with C programming with ease of use and improved safety reminiscent of languages like PHP. It&#x27;s free and open source software, and licensed under GPLv3 and LGPL 3 for libraries, so you can even build commercial software with it.
Vely works on major Linux distributions and processor architectures. You can use webservers, such as Apache, Nginx, or others, and databases such as MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
You can use Vely for web applications, command-line programs, as middleware, database applications, services software, data integr…</span>

兆芯早在 2019 年就推出了代号为 “陆家嘴” 的 16 纳米 x86 CPU，可以用于笔记本电脑、服务器等设备。“陆家嘴” CPU 的运行频率可达 3GHz，支持 DDR4-3200 内存，可处理高达 64GB 的内存。本周，GCC 编译器对 “陆家嘴” 的支持再次被送出，因为他们之前的上游尝试由于在周期中较晚而没有进入 GCC 12。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：中国的 CPU 要想得到更多支持，积极向上游提交代码才行，兆芯在最近几个月才开始尝试在 GCC 中对“陆家嘴”进行上游检测和支持。




AI 正在打破专利法

过去几年，越来越多的发明涉及到了 AI。AI 帮助设计药物，开发疫苗，发现新材料。它的广泛使用对现有的专利制度构成了挑战。因为旧的专利法假设发明者是人类。如果法院和政府决定 AI 创造的发明不能授予专利，无疑这将会产生巨大影响，将会降低利用 AI 进行研究和发明的积极性。有研究人员提出设计新的 AI 专利法律 AI-IP 去保护 AI 的发明。

老王点评：你看，随着 AI 能拥有专利，以后具有 AI 的机器人也会逐渐得到更多的法律地位。




科学家们正在建立量子互联网

中国和美国等国家已经在量子计算机方面取得了一些进展，但如果没有“量子互联网”，量子计算将无法发挥其潜力。量子互联网是可以在遥远的机器之间发送量子信息的计算机网络。量子传送可以在不同地点之间传递信息，而不需要实际移动容纳信息的物理物质，而且这种方式无法拦截。之前，科学家只能做到在两个地点传送量子，而现在荷兰代尔夫特理工大学的研究人员做到了在三个地点间传送，他们的目标是最终建立一个量子互联网。


消息来源：纽约时报



老王点评：量子技术就这样一步步进步，我现在已经完全无法想象量子计算能将这个世界变成什么样子了。

                              <span>在 Fedora 中重置忘记的 root 密码。




你是否忘记了 Fedora 中的 root 密码？或者你想更改 Fedora 系统中的 root 用户密码？没问题！本手册将指导你在 Fedora 操作系统中完成更改或重置 root 密码的步骤。

注意： 本手册已在 Fedora 36 和 35 版本上进行了正式测试。下面提供的步骤与在 Fedora Silverblue 和旧 Fedora 版本中重置 root 密码的步骤相同。

步骤 1 - 打开 Fedora 系统并按下 ESC 键，直到看到 GRUB 启动菜单。出现 GRUB 菜单后，选择要引导的内核并按下 e 编辑选定的引导条目。



步骤 2 - 在下一个页面中，你将看到所有启动参数。找到名为 ro 的参数。



步骤 3 - 将 ro 参数替换为 rw init&#x3D;/sysroot/bin/sh。请注意 rw 和 init&#x3D;/sysroot...之间的空格。修改后的内核参数行应如下所示。



步骤 4 - 上述步骤更改参数后，按 Ctrl+x 进入紧急模式，即单用户模式。

在紧急模式下，输入以下命令以 读/写 模式挂载根文件系统（/）。

chroot /sysroot/




步骤 5 - 现在使用 passwd 命令重置 root 密码：

passwd root


输入两次 root 密码。我建议使用强密码。



步骤 6 - 重置 root 密码后，运行以下命令在重启时启用 SELinux 重新标记：

touch /.autorelabel




步骤 7 - 最后，退出单用户模式并通过运行以下命令将 Fedora 系统重启到正常模式：

exit


reboot


等待 SELinux 重新标记完成。这将需要几分钟，具体时长取决于文件系统的大小和硬盘的速度。



步骤 8 - 文件系统重新标记完成后，你可以使用新的 root 密码登录到你的 Fedora 系统。



如你所见，在 Fedora 36 中重置 root 密码的步骤非常简单，并且与 在 RHEL 中重置 root 密码 及其衍生版本（如 CentOS、AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux）完全相同。

Kubernetes Database Operator is useful for building scalable database servers as a database (DB) cluster. But because you have to create new artifacts expressed as YAML files, migrating existing databases to Kubernetes requires a lot of manual effort. This article introduces a new open source tool named Konveyor Tackle-DiVA-DOA (Data-intensive Validity Analyzer-Database Operator Adaptation). It automatically generates deployment-ready artifacts for database operator migration. And it does that through datacentric code analysis.
What is Tackle-DiVA-DOA?

In the age of high-speed internet, most large information systems are structured as distributed systems with components running on different machines. The performance of these systems is generally assessed by their throughput and response time. When performance is poor, debugging these systems is challenging due to the complex interactions between different subcomponents and the possibility of the problem occurring at various places along the communication path.
On the fastest networks, the performance of a distributed system is limited by the host&#x27;s ability to generate, transmit, process, and receive data, which is in turn dependent on its hardware…</span>

DuckDuckGo 的搜索主要是基于微软的必应搜索。最近，研究人员发现 DuckDuckGo 手机浏览器并没有阻止第三方网站上的微软追踪器。DuckDuckGo 解释称，微软不知道用户在 DuckDuckGo 上的搜索，DuckDuckGo 浏览器也屏蔽了所有微软的 cookie，但如果你访问了一个含有微软跟踪程序的网站，那么用户的数据将会暴露给必应搜索引擎和领英。DuckDuckGo 称，根据一份保密的微软搜索合作协议要求，他们为了从必应拉取搜索信息必须如此。

荷兰警方制作被害男孩的深度伪造视频，希望获得新线索

在一名少年被谋杀近 20 年后，荷兰警方在使用深度伪造技术将其“复活”后收到了几十条线索。2003 年，一位 13 岁的少年在鹿特丹地铁站的停车场扔雪球时被击毙。这件谋杀案让警方困惑了多年。在其家人的允许下，警方制作了一个视频，在视频中，这位少年请求公众帮助解决这起悬案。荷兰警方认为这可能是世界首例，视频中出现了该少年栩栩如生的形象，并请求知情者提供线索。

                              <span>掌握管理本地/远程分支等最常见的 Git 任务。


Git 的主要优势之一就是它能够将工作“分叉”到不同的分支中。

如果只有你一个人在使用某个存储库，分支的好处是有限的。但是，一旦你开始与许多其他贡献者一起工作，分支就变得必不可少。Git 的分支机制允许多人同时处理一个项目，甚至是同一个文件。用户可以引入不同的功能，彼此独立，然后稍后将更改合并回主分支。那些专门为一个目的创建的分支，有时也被称为主题分支topic branch，例如添加新功能或修复已知错误。

当你开始使用分支，了解如何管理它们会很有帮助。以下是开发者在现实世界中使用 Git 分支执行的最常见任务。

重命名分支

有时候，你或许会错误地命名了一个分支，或者你会想要在内容合并到主分支后，使用同一个分支在不同的错误或任务之间切换。在这种情况下，重命名主题分支就会很有帮助。

重命名本地分支

1、重命名本地分支：

$ git branch -m 
 


当然，这只会重命名你的分支副本。如果远程 Git 服务器上存在该分支，请继续执行后续步骤。

2、推送这个新分支，从而创建一个新的远程分支：

$ git push origin 


3、删除旧的远程分支：

$ git push origin -d -f 



重命名当前分支

当你要重命名的分支恰好是当前分支时，你不需要指定旧的分支名称。

1、重命名当前分支：

$ git branch -m 


2、推送新分支，从而创建一个新的远程分支：

$ git push origin 


3、删除…</span>

在传统的 Unix 和类 Unix 系统上，新系统中存在的第一个同时也是唯一的用户是 root。使用 root 账户登录并创建“普通”用户。在初始化之后，你应该以普通用户身份登录。

以普通用户身份使用系统是一种自我施加的限制，可以防止愚蠢的错误。例如，作为普通用户，你不能删除定义网络接口的配置文件或意外覆盖用户和组列表。作为普通用户，你无权访问这些重要文件，所以你无法犯这些错误。作为系统的实际所有者，你始终可以通过 su 命令切换为超级用户（root）并做你想做的任何事情，但对于日常工作，你应该使用普通账户。

几十年来，su 运行良好，但随后出现了 sudo 命令。

对于日常使用超级用户的人来说，sudo 命令乍一看似乎是多余的。在某些方面，它感觉很像 su 命令。例如：

$ su root

# dnf install -y cowsay


sudo 做同样的事情：

$ sudo dnf install -y cowsay



它们的作用几乎完全相同。但是大多数发行版推荐使用 sudo 而不是 su，甚至大多数发行版已经完全取消了 root 账户（LCTT 译注：不是取消，而是默认禁止使用 root 用户进行登录、运行命令等操作。root 依然是 0 号用户，依然拥有大部分系统文件和在后台运行大多数服务）。让 Linux 变得愚蠢是一个阴谋吗？

事实并非如此。sudo 使 Linux 更加灵活和可配置，并且没有损失功能，此外还有 几个显著的优点。

为什么在 Linux 上 sudo 比 root 更好？

以下是你应该使用 sudo 替换 su 的五个原因。

1. root 是被攻击确认的对象

根据 AOSP（Android 开源项目）上的讨论，小米工程师提议给安卓添加 SELinux 策略以禁止提取 apk 文件，让用户只能通过官方商店或授权网站下载应用，小米的理由是 apk 文件可能含有来自私有来源的数据，比如其中的图像可能会被其他人拿来重复使用。但谷歌拒绝了这一提议。

开发者调查显示对区块链、加密货币和 NFT 有强烈兴趣

根据对两万多名编程人员的调查，SlashData 的 2022 年度开发者调查显示，34% 的开发者表示正在学习加密货币知识，16% 的人表示正在参与加密货币项目；32% 接受调查的开发者表示在了解 NFT 相关知识，11% 的人正参与 NFT 项目。此外 30% 的人正在学习加密货币之外的区块链应用，但仅有 12% 在从事这些区块链项目。

老王点评：抛开各种金融困境不说，我是坚定地认为区块链及加密货币必然有其存在价值，是为未来所打造的基础技术。




将云计算引入机器人操作系统

由于重量和功率要求，机器人的机载计算能力往往受到限制，它们也很少有硬件加速器，如 GPU、TPUS 或 FPGA。但许多机器人算法和最近的进展都得益于高端计算机和硬件加速器。伯克利人工智能研究实验室正在开发开源机器人操作系统 FogROS。他们设想使用云计算来加速缓慢的计算，可以使机器人在相同的时间内做更多的事情。他们已经开放了 FogROS 2 预览版。FogROS 2 将 SLAM 延迟降低了 50%，将抓取规划时间从 14 秒减少到 1.2 秒，并将运动规划速度提高了 28 倍，与替代方案相比 FogROS 2 将网络使用率降低了 3.8 倍。

老王点评：云计算是大脑，而这些机器人就是它的手臂，可以预期将来的机器人会更强大，但是我总有对这种有强大智能的机器人一些恐惧。</span>

When operating on the Linux command line, it is easy to get disoriented, which can have disastrous consequences. I once issued a remove command before realizing that I&#x27;d moved the boot directory of my computer. I learned to use the pwd command to know exactly which part of the file system I was in (and these days, there are command projects, like trashy and trash-cli, that serve as intermediates when removing files).
When I was new to Linux, I had a cheat sheet that hung over my desk to help me remember those commands as I managed my Linux servers. It was called the 101 commands for Linux cheat sheet. As I became more familiar with these commands, I became more profic…</span>

Many organizations have security policies in place that dictate how to store sensitive information. When you&#x27;re developing applications for the cloud, you&#x27;re probably expected to follow those policies, and to do that you often have to externalize your data storage. Kubernetes has a built-in system to access external secrets, and learning to use that is key to a safe cloud-native app.
In this article, I&#x27;m going to demonstrate how to build a Quarkus reactive application with externalized sensitive information—for instance, a password or token—using Kubernetes Secrets. A secret is a good example of how cloud platforms can secure applications by removing…</span>

I will also walk you through a simple lab that demonstrates building and running im…</span>
