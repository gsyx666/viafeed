Microsoft is bringing a new taskbar overflow feature to Windows 11, designed to make it easier to find your open apps once you run out of taskbar space. It’s perfect for power users or people who love to keep all of their apps open all the time. The new taskbar overflow is a three-dot menu that appears once you’ve run out of taskbar space, and neatly hides all the apps that can’t fit on the taskbar all at the same time.
Currently, if you open too many apps in Windows 11 and Windows 10, then the taskbar creates an overflow area that only shows the most recent app that has been used or open. This means that if you’re an app connoisseur, it can get difficult to navigate between lots of programs on smaller laptop screens (especially if you...

A new feature that lets you extract a short audio clip from a Twitter Space is getting a widespread release on iOS and Android, Twitter has announced. Anyone in a Space is able to make a clip, which then expires after 30 days. Although the feature isn’t currently available to Twitter web users, the platform says support is “on the way.”
Clips are designed to make content from Twitter’s live audio feature more easily sharable on the platform, by serving up the best bits of an audio livestream without asking listeners to sit through the whole thing. 
The widespread rollout of the feature follows a more limited test that started in March. At the time, the ability to clip a Space was only available to a small number of users on iOS, and even...

Have you seen the tank of nightmare fuel currently circulating around the internet — the video where a robot dog fires an assault rifle? I’ve got good and bad news.
The good news: It’s probably just a dangerous toy cobbled together by a Russian hoverbike startup guy.
Vice traced the video back to a Russian hoverbike company founder named Alexander Atamanov, who uploaded both the video and a high-res image of the gun-dog-bot in March. Looking at both the bot itself, it’s not clear it’s anything more than a gun strapped to an existing Unitree dogbot. (It’s not clear if the bot even aims or fires the gun itself.) Looking at his larger Facebook history, it seems likely that he simply slapped together a couple of things he liked into a new...

Ten years after launching a pioneering combination of Linux preinstalled on a commercial laptop with Project Sputnik, Dell and Canonical announced that the XPS 13 Plus is the first OEM PC certified for Ubuntu 22.04 Long-Term Support (LTS). That makes this a straightforward route to having a PC that just works without worrying about whether or not each component is ready to work with Linux.
Linux-equipped Developer Edition models of the laptop were already available, with prices starting at $1,289.00, but currently ship with the older 20.04 LTS software. Long-term support releases deliver what it says on the tin, with the end of standard support for this version scheduled in 2027 and the end of life in 2032. Certified devices are lab...

Smart home company Eve continues its transition to Thread this week with the release of the second generation of its motion sensor. A wireless sensor that works over Thread and Bluetooth Low Energy, the Eve Motion is the first standalone motion sensor to use the Thread wireless protocol, which is a pillar of the new Matter smart home standard. 
Today, the motion sensor will work with Apple HomeKit to trigger automations such as turning on connected smart lights or opening smart window shades. But when Matter arrives later this year, Eve says the motion sensor and all Eve’s Thread-based products will receive an over-the-air firmware update to be compatible with Matter. This will open the device to other Matter ecosystems, including Google...

What had once been a warning of dark times to come is now a reality. Square Enix has finally announced its NFT (or non-fungible token) project after threatening us with the company’s embrace of the controversial and largely reviled-by-gamers blockchain technology.
To facilitate this extraordinary waste of fans’ good-will, Square Enix has partnered with Enjin, an NFT company that will store Square Enix’s tokens on its Efinity blockchain. Starting today, consumers will be able to pre-order a physical action figure that comes with a code redeemable for a digital NFT. There will also be physical trading cards that similarly have a digital NFT component available for pre-order later this year.

                              <span>Hey developers👋 I am Yash Makan and I welcome you to a brand new series where we are going to create different UI designs a week in Flutter. So basically, I am going to pick any UI design from the internet and the design can either be an image, Figma file or a PSD file. Also, in the series, we are just going to focus on the frontend and not the backend and will create designs for mobile as well as web. If you have any UI design requests for future parts in the series then make sure to drop them below that as well. In the first part, we are designing the UI of Instagram App. If you are interested then do check the video below,

                              <span>What is a JavaScript framework?


A JavaScript framework is a tool that helps developers to create and structure code. A framework provides a predefined structure for code, which makes it easier to develop complex applications.
Using a JavaScript framework can have many benefits. It can help you organize and automate your code, making it more readable and maintainable in the process. If you&#x27;re looking to improve the quality of your code, a JavaScript framework is definitely worth considering.
When comparing React and Next.js, the first thing to look at is their features. Both frameworks have a lot to offer, but there are some key differences between them.
Ease of use: 
React is easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for developers who are new to JavaScript frameworks.

Hello 👋,
Back for a little article about the rebranding of one of the NodeSecure tools: Vulnera (previously vuln, the vuln-era has begun!).
An opportunity for me to also write about this wonderful project that was born with the redesign of the back-end less than a year ago ⌚. If you don&#x27;t remember I wrote an article:

Don&#x27;t wait and dive in 🌊 with me to discover this tool 💃.
Vulnera is a package that allows you to programmatically fetch your Node.js project vulnerabilities from multiple sources or strategies:

Remote patient monitoring services have gained popularity before the covid-19 healthcare crisis.

                              <span>In this post I will help you build a random password generator in the most easiest and efficient way.
How can we build this 🤔?
First thing we will do is to ask the user what is the length of the string
We will get random values from a list containing all the alphabets(both uppercase and lowercase), numbers and special characters like #,@,#... 
Most of the people generally makes this mistake while doing this project. they will create a list and they will start writing all the characters, numbers manually... like below code 👇👇
characters &#x3D; [&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;,&#x27;d&#x27;,......,&#x27;A&#x27;,&#x27;B&#x27;,&#x27;C&#x27;....]

This will definitely not make you a good programmer.
There is a module named string in python which will give you all the alphabets and special characters.
Create a list which contain all the alphabets, numbers and special characters as shown below.
import string

# getting all the alphabets
characters &#x3D; list(string.ascii_letters)

# adding numbers from 0 to 9
characters.extend(list(x for x in range(0,10)))

# adding all the special characters
characters.extend(list(string.punctuation))

characters list will look as shown below.
[&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;, &#x27;f&#x27;, &#x27;g&#x27;, &#x27;h&#x27;, &#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;j&#x27;, &#x27;k&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27;, &#x27;m&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;q&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;, &#x27;s&#x27;, &#x27;t&#x27;, &#x27;u&#x27;, &#x27;v&#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;, &#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;, &#x27;z&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, &#x27;F&#x27;, &#x27;G&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;J&#x27;, &#x27;K&#x27;, &#x27;L&#x27;, &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;O&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;R&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;U&#x27;, &#x27;V&#x27;, &#x27;W&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27;, &#x27;Z&#x27;, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &#x27;!&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;#&#x27;, &#x27;$&#x27;, &#x27;%&#x27;, &#x27;&amp;&#x27;, &quot;&#x27;&quot;, &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;)&#x27;, &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27;-&#x27;, &#x27;.&#x27;, &#x27;/&#x27;, &#x27;:&#x27;, &#x27;;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;?&#x27;, &#x27;@&#x27;, &#x27;[&#x27;, &#x27;\\&#x27;, &#x27;]&#x27;, &#x27;^&#x27;, &#x27;_&#x27;, &#x27;&#x60;&#x27;, &#x27;{&#x27;, &#x27;|&#x27;, &#x27;}&#x27;, &#x27;~&#x27;]

import string
import random

num &#x3D; int(input(&#x27;Enter the length of password : &#x27;))

# getting all the alphabets
characters &#x3D; list(string.ascii_letters)

# adding numbers from 0 to 9
characters.extend(list(x for x in range(0,10)))

# adding all the special characters
characters.extend(list(string.punctuation))

password &#x3D; &#x27;&#x27;

for i in range(num):
    password &#x3D; password + str(random.choice(characters));

print(password)

                              <span>Lately, I have observed that developers, especially the ones who’re starting out — are under the influence of different factors and get lost in the concept of “perfectionism”.
We, as developers, want the best for ourselves and what we produce. As we build from scratch it’s natural to be committed to what we produce. Hoping it’s flawless. This is one of the factors that force us to be “perfect”.
So, is being perfect a realistic goal?
Do we have to be perfect? Or are we unintentionally forced to be perfect?
We know that the software community has a multidisciplinary structure. The emergence of a working code is the result of the collaboration of scientists, mathematicians, and programmers.
You will meet people with different knowledge and experience in such a field. In such a situation, you …</span>

                              <span>This code returns a token error:
function foo(){ }(); // Error: Unexpected token &#x27;)&#x27;

If we place an expression inside the second parens (the grouping operator, which expects an expression to be evaluated), the error goes away.
function foo(){ }(1);

So, we know the token error is due to the second parens, which did not have any expression to evaluate.
But... it still doesn&#x27;t work as an IIFE.
Let&#x27;s change foo() to log a greeting. As you can see, nothing gets logged to the console.
function foo(){ console.log(&#x27;Hello from foo!&#x27; }(1); // Nothing logged to the console

This is because foo() is never invoked.
In fact, we are wrong in expecting foo() to be invoked like this:
function foo(){ console.log(&#x27;Hello from foo!&#x27; }();

Because, the second parens does not stand for invoking foo() here. And that is because the function declaration left to it, function foo(){ }, is not an expression. It&#x27;s just a definition.
The parser sees the code above as:
function foo(){ console.log(&#x27;Hello from foo!&#x27; };
();

In order to make the second parens (immediately) invoke foo(), we need to make the function declaration evaluate to a function expression first. And guess what, we do it with another parens.
(function foo(){ console.log(&#x27;Hello from foo!&#x27; });

We can then go ahead and apply the invocation parens:
(function foo(){ console.log(&#x27;Hello from foo!&#x27; })(); // &quot;Hello from foo!&quot;

Another fix would be to wrap the entire code in an overarching parens. This will also make it work as an IIFE:
(function foo(){ console.log(&#x27;Hello from foo!&#x27;) }()); // &quot;Hello from foo!&quot;

Here, everything, including the last parens is considered part of one expression and so foo() gets invoked.

                              <span>In this article, we will discuss IPv4 and about the highest value, we can use for one byte. A byte is made up of eight binary digits (bits) that are all either 0 or 1. Let&#x27;s see all this in the following article.

IPv4 stands for internet protocol version 4 which is the 4th version of the internet protocol. It is also called octet because each decimal number represents 8 bits or one byte.IPv4 takes the 4 bytes which are equal to 32 bits. It means we can use 4,294,967,296 (232) unique addresses. The IPv4 address is divided into two parts;
Network address
Host address
The network address determines how many of 32 bits are used for the network address and remaining bits are used for the host address.
129.144.56.50
The first underlined part represents the network address and the second part represents the host address.
One byte has a maximum value of 8 bits and the largest decimal which can be stored in one byte is 255. So, the largest value for one byte we can store is 255.
The largest value can be found as;
(2 ^ 8 -1) &#x3D; 255
2 represents the base number and 8 represents the bits in one byte. Each bit has a value of 0 or 1 so new can represent 255 in binary like 11111111. Therefore 255.255.255.255 is the maximum range of IPv4 addresses. The address in this format is called the dotted-decimal form.
As a result, 2n - 1, where n is the number of bits, can be used to calculate the largest value. Hope it helped. Happy exploring!!</span>

Listen to the recording
I thought I&#x27;d take this opportunity to write more in-depth about how I see this.
First of all, I don&#x27;t like roadmaps. They are impersonal, don&#x27;t add value, and might confuse you.
If we go one layer deeper, it&#x27;s really around people wanting to get into technical writing, but they don&#x27;t know where to start.
So let&#x27;s see this as a guidance article rather than a roadmap, shall we?
To help you go into technical writing, you should first answer the following question:
Why do you want to become a technical writer?
The answer to that question will help you determine what to focus on and how to proceed.
Let&#x27;s look at some common answers:

教育优惠车，加了 400 换第三代 airpods ，总共花费 2.6w
本来能更快收到，EMS 磨磨唧唧的。  
64G+1T 版本，24 核心 GPU ，跑 tensorflow 训练 1200 张图片耗时差不多 9 分钟左右，2017 款大概 40 分钟。

Please wait...
We are checking your browser... www.ethermine.org

梯子使用 v2ray （ vless ） + tls + ws + CF cdn ，几个月来一直很稳，最近开始浏览器经常遇到 cf 验证码，自动验证完成跳转到目标页面，google 系没问题，如果访问的目标网站来自 cf 则大概率会遇到验证码，比如： https://www.ethermine.org
请求路径大概是：china mainland &gt; cf cdn &gt; japan (oracle) &gt; another cf ip (target website)
具体故障是浏览器请求某些 xhr 接口出现 403 http 状态码，但页面的请求是完成了的
页面域名： https://www.ethermine.org ，经过 cf 的验证码页面自动跳转后请求完成。
页面通过 xhr 请求了另一个域名： https://api.ethermine.org/ ，这个域名始终返回 403 ，请求方法是 get ，如果复制地址单独用浏览器打开又是正常，很迷醉。
网上搜了个遍，修改 v2ray 配置，修改 nginx 配置，调整 cf 防火墙级别到最低，添加 cf 防火墙规则都没用。
如果换成其他节点，比如付费机场或者 heroku 都不会遇到 cf 验证码，排除了客户端问题。
有遇到的吗？</span>

这里给大家分享一下(建议不要买小米手机了)
先将手机拿到售后点或者小米之家去检测, 需要在上班时间(早于六点), 大约需要一个小时检测, 然后就直接告诉我这个手机可以免费换新机, 需要等个 7-15 天
然后等售后打电话.到了之后就去店里面换手机. 由于 wifi 坏了, 只能通过电脑来转移数据.. 我 40g 数据大概花了一个多小时...
换新成功之后,
大概一周左右. 出现无故重启....真是服了...</span>

开发动机
开发这款应用主要还是因为在这个浮躁的环境下想要去专注做一件事情变的越来越难，所以自己写了这样一款应用来帮助你专注。
这类应用确实烂大街了，很难做出什么突破性的创新，所以也就只能在 UI 和细节上面做些微微的创新了,以及提供不同的口味。
技术栈
Swift 5.6 + SwiftUI 3.0
系统需求 macOS 12 及以上，iOS 15 及以上版本。
App 功能
番茄钟
各种氛围音
图表分析专注数据
App 屏蔽列表，在你启动番茄钟的时候（仅限 macOS ）

如图所示
黑群晖，两个萤石的摄像头，C6C 和 C6CN ，通过群晖的套件 surveillance ，rstp 协议录像。硬盘是 256G 的 SSD ，网络是无线 2.4G 的。打开群晖的资源监控，网络流量，下载实时 300KB/s 左右。
录像出来，下载下来，打开播放，断断续续会出现下图所示的灰影，也不知道是不是丢帧了，还是什么问题。
在 windows （播放器 mpc-be ） &amp; macOS （播放器 VLC ）下面都试过了，现象一样。应该是录下来的视频文件就是这样子的了。
surveillance 里面的录像设置，也没有啥特别的，都是“根据摄像头的分辨率”等等设置，几乎没有办法定制。</span>

昨天开始写了一篇百度经验，在经历了 20 多次失败之后，在此记录一下经历，为啥要用征战呢？因为过程过于曲折。
首先为什么要写这个，说实话百度经验就是垃圾堆，但是做个人产品的都知道在国内百度 SEO 的重要性了（诸如 CSDN 这些 SEO 比较好的垃圾站流量不少），而百度经验必然会为 SEO 加分，所以这一路都经历了什么呢？
1 、提交报敏感词，也不告诉哪个词有问题，经过逐一删减排查后发现可能是“学生”两个字导致的。
2 、终于提交了，但是人工审核给退回了 N 次，其中的原因包括：
标题不符（应该是有类似的百度经验标题存在）
物料不对（应该是工具 /原料那里没填好）
截图模糊（本质原因是百度默认给你压缩成宽度 500px ，所以在截图的时候需要保证图片本身宽度在 500 以内，真尼玛坑）
截图有 logo 品牌之类的（截图的时候要把网站顶部的 logo 去掉）
截图不合规（需要模糊掉里面的文字内容）
格式不对（应该是某个步骤有多个换行）
最终经历了来来回回反复修改之后依然不通过。
于是我看了其它的经验，不禁恍然大悟，我特么写太多了，而百度经验需要的是一个步骤一句话那种，于是乎，我悟了，我将其拆成了 N 个经验，于是通过了。（附一个地址： https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/ac6a9a5e00796f6a653eac81.html ）
因为没地方申述，所以就直接在经验正文里面“友好”询问原因，不容易哎。</span>

我的神州专车账号里还有几千余额，已经快两年没有打过车了。这两年基本上都是用滴滴。
前几天天气不好，打滴滴排队很长，突然想起来它，打开 app 准备打个专车试试。结果最后下单前多了一步操作，它要登记乘车人信息以验证健康码，这已经很奇怪了（滴滴从来没要过），结果我填写了手机号和身份证，提示没有健康码信息，之后我还用家人和亲友的手机号 /身份证组合作为乘车人信息试了好几次，无一例外都是没有健康码信息。
结果就是没法打车，当时也就是算了。
这几天看到了各式各样的银行限制取款的事件，突然想起来，这难道也是一种变相的限制取款（限制消费余额）。
不知道这里有没有最近用过神州专车的网友，如果是预充的余额，还能正常打车消费吗？</span>

最近我们技术部想把单机版的项目部署成微服务架构可动态扩容式的，但是鄙人不太精通 k8s+docker ，还有微服务治理方面的东西（之前想着学来着，也正在学但是感觉微服务需要懂的东西有点多，一时半会还搞不定）。
所以就想着买一个阿里云容器服务 Kubernetes 集群服务，之前没用过，想问问有没有用过阿里云这套东西的人，如果买了以后，我这边是不是只需要部署代码就 ok ，不需要再去管 微服务的一些 服务发现、服务注册、链路追踪、日志分析等事项啦。只需要把项目打包成镜像 运行 docker 容器就行,是这样的吗。</span>

看 XPS spec 发现居然还是 1080P+8GB 起步，看了圈发现 Dell ，HP 1000 刀以上的机器居然还有 11 代酷睿+8GB+1080P ，而且不是少数😨这配置 Realmebook 只卖 3k ，价格稍稍往上都是 12 代 i5+16+512GB 还有 2K 高刷的机子。
苹果的 iPhone 11 ，12 的销量很不错，三星 A 系列卖的也很好，但看一下发现 500 刀以下的 Android 机，很多没有 5G ，配置还是 4+64GB+720P😨500 刀的机子还是 4+128 用着骁龙 7 系 U ，iPhone 性价比一下显现出来了。
虽然总有人分析苹果不升级是因为 4GB 的 iOS 和 8GB 的 macOS 流畅度够好，事实上苹果可能根本不这么想，它的配置只需要比那些摆烂对手更具备竞争力就够了。</span>

When I write documentation for a project, I often write the Readme file and Install instructions in plain text. I don&#x27;t need to use markup languages like HTML or Markdown to describe what a project does or how to compile it. But maintaining this documentation can be a pain. If I need to update the middle of a sentence in my Readme text file, I need to reformat the text so I don&#x27;t end up with a really long or short line in the middle of my other text that&#x27;s otherwise formatted to 75 columns. Some editors include a feature that will automatically reformat text to fill paragraphs, but not all do. That&#x27;s where the Linux fmt command comes to the rescue.

Teams require some kind of process to coordinate work and ensure that the output of many focuses on a singular goal. Within the software industry, this has taken the form of teams following a methodology such as Agile. In industries from pharmaceutical to manufacturing, Lean is the philosophy followed to ensure that a process is adhered to. The difficulty with a process is that it&#x27;s prescriptive. It&#x27;s designed in such a way that you stay on the tracks that it provides. If you do, you achieve the prescribed benefits and ultimately a form of success. That doesn&#x27;t give much room for paradigm-level shifts in work behavior.

                              <span>本初学者指南解释了如何在 Ubuntu/Linux 中快速共享一个文件夹。


在 Ubuntu/Linux 中共享一个文件夹并在其他操作系统（如 Windows）中通过网络访问并不难。默认情况下，Ubuntu 并没有安装所需的软件包。但是，你可以打开安装向导来自动安装所需的软件。

本 指南 适用于所有 Ubuntu 版本（包括 22.04、20.04、18.04、19.10 以及即将发布的版本 —— 除非此功能的设计发生重大的变化）。

Ubuntu 中共享文件夹的步骤

步骤 1： 打开文件管理器，右键单击共享的文件夹。点击上下文菜单中的“本地网络共享”选项。



步骤 2： 在文件夹共享对话框中点击共享文件夹复选框。

这将在你的系统中安装 Samba 软件包。Samba 用于在 Windows 和 Unix 系统之间通过网络共享文件和打印机。



步骤 3： 安装 Samba 后，执行以下操作共享文件夹或目录。


选中共享文件夹复选框。

输入共享名称。这将是你从另一个系统（如 Windows）看到的名称。尽量不要使用任何带有空格的名称。

（可选）通过勾选相应选项，你可以控制共享文件夹的写入权限，以及允许访客访问。

如果你允许访客访问，则没有凭据的人可以访问共享文件夹。所以要谨慎。

如果你希望用户输入用户名和密码，打开终端并运行以下命令。


sudo smbpasswd -a 用户名


用户名 应该是对应 Ubuntu 系统的有效用户。

现在，你应该已经设置好了共享的文件夹或目录。

如何访问共享文件夹

从 Ubuntu/Linux 系统中访问共享文件夹，你需要系统的 IP 地址或主机名。为此，打开“系统设置System Settings -&gt; Wi-Fi -&gt; 获取 IP 地址Get the IP address”。



如果你运行的是 Linux 发行版不是 Ubuntu，此步骤略有不同。你可能想运行 ip addr 来获取 IP 地址，如下所示：



一旦你获得 IP 地址，就可以在 Ubuntu/Linux 系统中打开文件管理器，然后在地址栏中输入以下内容。注意：你应该修改为你系统的 IP 地址。

你现在可以看到共享文件夹上面显示了一个小共享图标，表示网络共享文件夹。



要在 Windows 系统 访问共享文件夹，打开运行（按下 Windows + R）或打开资源管理器，输入以下地址。注意：你应该修改为你系统的 IP 地址和文件夹名称。

\\192.168.43.19\Folder


你应该能够查看共享文件夹的内容，并根据授予的权限修改它。

总结

我已经向你展示了如何从 Ubuntu 共享一个件夹，并通过 IP 地址在 Windows 系统中访问。对于其他 Linux 发行版，你也可以执行相同的步骤。如果本文对你有帮助，在下面的评论框中告诉我。

                              <span>面向初学者的 Docker 基本命令指南。


这篇详细的 Docker 教程覆盖了核心的 Docker 命令，比如，如何创建新容器、运行容器、删除容器等。另外，这篇教程也解释了如何从已有的容器构建你自己的 Docker 镜像，如何移除容器和镜像。言归正传，现在开始 Docker 的基本用法。

Docker 安装步骤

大多数现代 Linux 操作系统都可以安装 Docker。如果还没安装过 Docker，请参考下面的步骤：


在 AlmaLinux、CentOS、Rocky Linux 上 安装 Docker Engine 和 Docker Compose

如何在 Ubuntu 上 安装 Docker 和 Docker Compose


什么是 Docker 镜像和 Docker 容器？

在开始 Docker 之前，我先说明一下 Docker 镜像和 Docker 容器是什么。

Docker 镜像是一个描述容器如何运行的的文件，Docker 容器是 Docker 镜像在运行或被终止时的一个阶段。

容器和主机上的其他文件是隔离的。

当我们运行一个 Docker 容器的时候，它会使用一个被隔离出来的文件系统，这个文件系统是由一个 Docker 镜像提供的。Docker 镜像包含了运行应用程序所需要的一切东西 - 所有的依赖、配置、脚本、二进制文件等等。

镜像也包含容器所需要的其他配置项，比如说环境变量、默认运行的命令，以及其他元数据。

Linux 下的 Docker 入门

下面的所有步骤都已在 Ubuntu 22.04、20.04 以及 18.04 LTS 服务器版本中测试通过。后续小节中提供的步骤对于所有 Linux 平台都是通用的。比如，在基于 RHEL 的系统中（比如 AlmaLinux）可以运行相同的命令。

“To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilized by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset,” Mojang said.
According to Mojang, some companies have created “NFT implementations that are associated with Minecraft world files and skin packs.” The...

160 hours into Elden Ring, I’m sure of one thing: the single most annoying thing about my Steam Deck is its whiny fan. And now, I’m so happy to report there’s a way to fix it. It takes roughly 15 minutes and $30 — depending on where you live — to install a replacement fan from iFixit. 
Five days ago, the repair company finally got a large shipment of those fans, and I bought one right away. Now, my Steam Deck’s tiny screech is gone. 
Is the fan still loud? Yes, yes it is, but it’s a whoosh instead of a whine. I like to think of it as the sound of air escaping the Deck’s vents, but mostly, I don’t think about it at all. I can easily tune out the new whoosh, whereas the whine always managed to get my attention even after Valve tweaked its...

Samsung is gearing up the hype machine for the release of its next foldables once again, and ahead of the next Unpacked event on August 10th, mobile president TM Roh has published another blog post making the case that the time for foldables is now — and that more people are picking up foldable phones. 
“Three years ago, Galaxy foldables could be summed up in a single word: radical,” Roh wrote. “Very quickly, however, it became clear that this groundbreaking, flexible design fit perfectly into modern lifestyles. As a result, what was once a novelty three years ago is now the preferred choice for millions.”
Samsung says that nearly 10 million foldable smartphones shipped worldwide in 2021
In the post, Roh says that the industry shipped...

Tesla already reported vehicle shipment numbers for the second quarter, and now its full Q2 2022 financial report (pdf) reveals it’s dealing with inflation and the overall economic downturn, combined with a plunge in prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the letter to investors, Tesla execs reveal the company has sold 75 percent of its Bitcoin holdings, adding $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. 
Last year, Tesla made a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and announced that it would accept Bitcoin as payment. Tesla started accepting Bitcoin in late March, then abruptly reversed itself in May, just 49 days later. 
In the latest report, Tesla says the value of its remaining “digital assets” is $218 million, which it had...

Alaska Airlines says it’s becoming the first US-based airline to roll out support for electronic bag tags, small programmable devices with e-paper displays that are designed to replace the paper tags currently in use. It plans to launch the new program in phases, and it’ll initially be focused on San Jose airport in California. The airline will initially give out 2,500 of the tags for free to its frequent flyers from the airport in late 2022, TechCrunch reports, and they’ll be available to purchase by Mileage Plan members next year.
Alaska Airlines intends for the tags to cut down on the amount of time its customers spend on flight admin at the airport. Rather than having to print a luggage tag in person, they can instead set up the...

Netflix wants linear TV to die. CEO Reed Hastings has been banging the TV murder drum for more than 8 years now, and in the investor call today, he reiterated his belief, confidently saying that Netflix was in a great place because linear TV would be dead in “5 to 10 years.”
Hastings is financially incentivized to say this. One of the biggest competitors for the largest streaming service on the planet is the set of totally free streaming channels that beam into any TV with an antenna, and their costlier friends on cable TV.
Netflix needs linear TV to die because it needs the streaming holdouts still using linear TV. It shed a whopping 1.3 million subscribers across the US and Canada in the last three months, according to its 2022 Q2...

A Taiwanese onomatopoeia, the auditory word is also the title of Cai Wei Qun’s elaborately constructed book on the craft, which opens to reveal a trove of history, techniques and tricks, and an entire loom tucked between its covers.
The clever design is fully functional and able to produce tiny tapestries based on the patterns and practices described, making the book an immersive and accessible manual. More</span>

Comprised of 791 individual photos, the seamless video took 22 days to complete and is part of omozoc’s growing archive of woodworking lessons, which you can find more of (make sure you turn your volume up to hear the incredibly satisfying audio) on YouTube.

为什么键盘上的字母按照QWERTY的顺序排列？为什么计算机编程总喜欢“Hello, World”？为什么电视剧时长通常为每集45分钟？为什么高铁座位分布是ABCDF却没有E呢……以上种种问题，都可以用“路径依赖”理论（Path-Dependence）加以解释。
普遍意义上，路径依赖是指一旦选择某一路径（无论是“好”还是“坏”）就可能对这种路径产生依赖，进而沿着既定方向持续前进。这一理论由美国经济学家Paul David在1985年提出，后因美国经济学家Doglass North借该理论阐释经济制度演进规律而扬名。[1]
通俗地讲，“路径依赖”可以被理解为传统惯习的力量，过去的经验被应用于新的情境之下，产生或好或坏的影响。
在互联网发展过程中，也存在着诸多“路径依赖”或“传统惯习”现象，甚至不被我们所察觉。当我们把视野进一步纵向拓展，这些习惯可能来自互联网初期、来自电视或印刷时代，或是更为久远的传播史早期。
本文从路径依赖的理论出发，希望去发现和理解网络生活中的此类现象，并进入媒介演进的视野，探索过去如何影响现在，甚至持续地影响着将来。
信息生活里的路径依赖现象
1868年，一位名叫Christopher Latham Sholes的美国出版商为打字机模型申请专利，并于1874年成功将商用打字机投放市场。
在这六年间，打字机键盘上的字母顺序几经变换，从“ABCDE”到“QWE.TY”，再到“QWERTUIOPY”，随后又调整了“Y”的顺序，最终固定为“QWERTY”。[2]
这一字母顺序借助打字机的行销逐渐成为打字员的习惯，进而延续至今，出现在我们使用的电脑键盘上，这可以看作是一种“路径依赖”。
同时，也有批评者认为QWERTY的布局并不符合使用习惯，因此，旨在提升打字效率的Dvorak键盘于1936年问世，但还是没有影响到前者的主导地位。

To this:

Summary

Windows Terminal. After that run this command to install PowerShell 7:
winget install --id Microsoft.Powershell --source winget

Installing oh-my-posh
winget install oh-my-posh

Then use this command to activate oh-my-posh
oh-my-posh get shell


Create a PowerShell Profile script:
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force


Open that with notepad:
notepad $PROFILE

Then add the line below:
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression

Installing Nerd Fonts

We’ll fix that soon. Now install Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font Complete open it and on that opening window, click install. Then head over to Terminal open Settings &gt; Defaults &gt; Appearance and select the font that you installed. 

for now your terminal should looks like this:

Setting VS Code Integrated terminal
Terminal: Select Default Profile

and select PowerShell as your default terminal.
Open your integrated terminal, you should see something like this:

Open Command Palette again and select Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) in the json file add following:
// Controls the font family.
&quot;editor.fontFamily&quot;: &quot;DejaVuSansMono Nerd Font&quot;,
// Controls the font size.
&quot;editor.fontSize&quot;: 14,

When you save that file your terminal should look better:

                              <span>Firstly, it’s a good idea to get familiar with what CSS is and how it is used. I have created another article explaining this topic. Here is a link to learn more about CSS and how to use it
The style rules in CSS are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the matching elements in your document.
A style rule has three parts: selector, property, and value.
For example, the headline color can be defined as:
h1 { color: blue; }


The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
One or more declarations are contained in the declaration block and are separated by semicolons.
Type selectors are the most widely used and simple to comprehend selectors. This selector focuses on certain page element types.
For example, to target all the paragraphs on the page:
p {
  text-align: cent…</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s talk about methods, or sometimes also known as function receivers.
Technically, Go is not an object-oriented programming language. It doesn&#x27;t have classes, objects, and inheritance.
However, Go has types. And, you can define methods on types.
A method is nothing but a function with a special receiver argument. Let&#x27;s see how we can declare methods.
func (variable T) Name(params) (returnTypes) {}

The receiver argument has a name and a type. It appears between the func keyword and the method name.
For example, let&#x27;s define a Car struct.
type Car struct {
    Name string
    Year int
}

Now, let us define a method like IsLatest which will tell us if a car was manufactured within the last 5 years.
func (c Car) IsLatest() bool {
    return c.Year &gt;&#x3D; 2017
}

As you can see, we can access t…</span>

Bugs can cause delays in the release of an application, and during the testing lifecycle or when the app is in production, developers tend to overlook bugs that are not properly described. This can spoil business relationships between an organization and its clients and may also lead to a company’s loss of reputation in the industry.

The explanation for how this gets evaluated is very elaborate, and it is covered case by case in this MDN article comprehensively.
The value of a function&#x27;s this is determined mostly by how the function is being called in the call site, rather than how the function is defined: things like whether strict mode is enabled or not, whether the function is defined and called standalone or not, whether we are calling the function as a method of an object or if we are extracting a reference of an object method and then calling it somewhere else, etc.

Arduino UNO 
Potentiometer
Arduino is an opensource electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor , a finger on a button , or a twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor , turning on a LED , publishing something online. To do so use the Arduino programming language (based on wiring) and the Arduino Software (IDE) based on processing.
A three-terminal resistor with a sliding or revolving contact that creates a variable voltage divider is called a potentiometer. It functions as a variable resistor or rheostat if only the wiper and one end of the connector are used.
int sensorPin &#x3D; A0;    // select the input pin for the potentiometer
int ledPin &#x3D; 13;      
int sensorValue &#x3D; 0;  
void setup() {
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  sensorValue &#x3D; analogRead(sensorPin);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(sensorValue);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(sensorValue);

In April 2022, I started tntjs with a little idea.At first, we promoted a runtime programming language to the outside world, implemented with pure JavaScript, but later felt unrealistic, so we changed tntjs to a real-time dynamic refresh front-end framework.
now,we are rewriting tntjs,We are about to release tntjs Alpha 0.2.0 at the end of July
let&#x27;s follow me!
in tntjs 0.2.0,every variables is dynamic,you can use  like use Vue {{ variableName }}


So,how do we set variables&#x27; value?
you can new a TNTApp Object
const app &#x3D; new TNT.TNTApp()
    .useData({
      x: 233333

SolidJS ranked #1 in the 2021 &quot;State of JS Front-End Frameworks&quot;, so we wanted
to see what the fuzz is about and give it a proper chance with a side project.
We started with a simple Single Page Application (SPA) and a few components but
wanted to add data with GraphQL. For GraphQL we needed some sort of
authentication, to identify users. This quickly turned more complex day by day.
The biggest pitfalls and challenges were understanding Reactivity in SolidJS and
the use of context providers. Last but not least, we wanted to add some
server-side rendering capabilities, which lead to a three week rabbit hole of
reading SolidJS code, Fastify Vite
and lots of trial and error. Fortunately,
Jonas Galvez was already working on
Fastify DX a new full stack framework

                              <span>When I was working as an engineer, I would often hear people from non-tech departments complaining about programmers being difficult to talk to. In my opinion, there’s a grain of truth to that - but it’s not our fault. 
Programming is a very niche field that is hard to talk about unless the person on the other side of the conversation knows what is going on. For developers, working with variables, functions, and methods is so routine we often forget not everyone is on the same page with us. 
Also, software engineering has a strong solitary component - if you write code for hours without having to talk to anyone, before you know it, reading social cues will get more challenging. 
So, if you are in software development, it is likely you’ll get out of the habit of communicating with the non-t…</span>

Firefox 浏览器即将引入名为 “Quick Actions” 的功能。用户可以在地址栏上直接输入命令，例如“查看页面源代码”、“打开浏览器设置”等等。Quick Actions 可以加速 Firefox 的某些操作，协助用户通过地址栏执行各项任务。而谷歌在 2020 年就为 Chrome 浏览器引入了该功能，用户可以直接在地址栏上输入并执行“管理密码”、“清除浏览数据”、“翻译页面”等命令。

微软再次调整销售开源软件的商店政策

微软上个月更新了它的应用商店规则，加入了一条“不要试图从开源或其他通常免费提供的软件中获利，也不要试图相对于产品提供的特性和功能定价过高”。微软的初衷被认为是善意的，旨在遏制重新打包免费的自由及开源软件将其变成付费软件的行为。然而自由及开源软件许可证并没有禁止此类行为，微软的规定将会影响其应用商店内的所有自由及开源软件。本周微软再次调整了应用商店政策，允许销售可免费获取的自由及开源软件，同时允许用户报告欺诈。

老王点评：这件事上，我想微软或许是善意的，但是动作有点冒失，文案也不够妥当。现在的解决方案比较合适，既允许开源软件卖钱，也允许对冒名者加以管理。

                              <span>FreeDOS 提供了一个叫做 FreeDOS Edit 的用户友好的文本编辑器。




在任何操作系统中，编辑文件都是一项常有的任务。当你想去做一个某事的笔记、写封信给朋友或升级一个系统配置 —— 你需要一个文本编辑器。FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器（也许没啥想象力）叫做 “FreeDOS Edit”。

编辑文件

最简单的启用 FreeDOS Edit 的方式就就是输入 EDIT。它提供一个空的编辑器窗口。图案背景显示为一个空的“桌面”——提醒你没有编辑任何文件。



就像多数 DOS 应用程序一样，你可以按下你键盘上的 Alt 键来访问 Edit 的菜单。这就激活了这个菜单。在你按下 Alt 后，Edit 将切换到“菜单”访问方式，并高亮 “文件File” 菜单。如果你想要访问菜单栏上的一个不同的菜单，可以使用左右方向键。按向下的方向键并按下回车键来“进入”菜单。



你注意到所有菜单标题的第一个字母是不同的颜色么？这种高亮字母显示了一种快捷方式。例如，“文件File”菜单的“F”高亮为红色。所以你可以按下 Alt+F（Alt 和 F 同时按下），Edit 会显示“文件File”菜单。



你可以使用“文件File”菜单来开始一个新的（空）文件，或打开一个存在的文件。让我们开始一个新文件，使用方向键移动到“新建New“然后按下回车键。你也可以用 Ctrl+N （Ctrl 和 N 同时按下）打开一个新文件。



此后，编辑文件应该非常简单。大多数熟悉的快捷键都可以在 FreeDOS Edit 中使用：Ctrl+C 复制文本，Ctrl+X 剪贴文本，和 Ctrl+V 将复制的或剪贴的文本粘贴到新的地方。如果你需要在一个长文档中寻找一个特殊文本，按下 Ctrl+F。保存你的工作成果，请使用 Ctrl+S 以将变更提交到硬盘。

在 Edit 中编程

如果你是个程序员，你也许会发现扩展的 ASCII 表是一个有用的工具。DOS 系统支持“拓展的” ASCII字符集，通常被称之为“代码页 437”。0 到 127 的标准字符包括字母 A 到 Z（大写和小写）、数字和特殊字符，如标点符号。但是，从 128 到 255 的 DOS 拓展字符包括其它语言字符和“画线”元素。DOS 程序员有时需要使用这些拓展 ASCII 字符，所以 FreeDOS Edit 可以很容易地查看所有 ASCII 码和它们的相关字符的表格。

要查看这个 ASCII 表，请使用“工具Utilities”菜单，选择“ASCII 表ASCII Table”菜单项，这将显示一个包含该表格的窗口。



沿着左边，这张表显示十六进制值“00”到“F0”，顶部展示了单一值“0”到“F”。这些为每个字符的十六进制代码提供了一个快速参考。例如，第一行（00）和第一列（0）中的项目具有十六进制值 00 + 0，即0x00（“NULL”值）。而第五行（40）和第二列（1）中的字符，其数值为 40 + 1，即 0x41（字母 “A”）。



当你在表格内移动光标高亮不同的字符时，你会看到表格底部的值发生变化，展示了字符的十进制、十六进制和八进制编码。例如，移动光标以高亮在 C0 行和第 5 列的“行交叉”字符，显示这个扩展字符的代码为 197（十进制）、0xc5（十六进制）和 305（八进制）。在一个程序中，你可以通过输入十六进制值 0xc5 或八进制“转义代码” \305 来引用这个扩展字符。



请随意浏览 Edit 中的菜单，以发现其他不错的功能。例如，“选项Options”菜单允许你更改 Edit 的行为和外观。如果你喜欢使用更密集的显示，可以使用“显示Display”菜单（在“选项Options”下）将 Edit 设置为 25、43 或 50 行。你还可以强制 Edit 以单色（黑底白字）或反转模式（白底黑字）显示。

                              <span>这个初学者指南解释了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay AUR 助手的步骤。


Yay 是 “Yet Another Yogurt” 的缩写（LCTT 校注：Yogurt 是另外一个已经停止维护的 AUR 助手）。从技术上讲，它是用 Go 编程语言 编写的 pacman 封装器和 AUR 助手。它是当今最流行的 Arch 用户仓库（AUR） 助手。使用 Yay，你可以利用庞大的 Arch 用户软件包库并轻松编译和安装任何软件。

它可以自动执行许多包管理任务，例如搜索、动态解决依赖关系、编译和构建包，当然还有在 AUR 发布包。

让我们看看如何在 Arch Linux 或任何基于 Arch 的发行版（如 Manjaro）中安装 Yay。安装 Arch Linux 后，你可以通过 pacman 包管理器从三个主要的 Arch 官方仓库安装包。但是在全新的 Arch Linux 安装后，默认情况下不会安装 Yay。因此，你需要手动安装它以利用 AUR。

本指南涵盖以下主题：


在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay

在 Manjaro 中安装 Yay

如何在 Arch Linux 和 Manjaro 中使用 Yay 安装包

一些 Yay 的技巧


在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay

先决条件

打开终端并运行以下命令。出现提示时提供管理员密码。这些步骤需要 base-devel 包和 git 包进行编译和安装。

sudo pacman -S base-devel


sudo pacman -S git




安装 Yay

yay 包在 Arch 仓库中有两个版本，如下所示。


yay – 稳定版

yay-git– 开发版


对于本指南，我使用了稳定版。现在，进入 /opt 目录并克隆 git 仓库。

cd /opt
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git




更改源目录的所有者。将 debugpoint 替换为你的用户名。

sudo chown -R debugpoint:users ./yay


如果你不知道用户或组，可以使用以下示例查找用户和组。

id debugpoint


进入目录并编译。

cd yay


makepkg -si


这样就完成了 Arch Linux 中 Yay 的安装。



在 Manjaro 中安装 Yay

如果你使用 Manjaro Linux，yay 包可以在社区仓库中找到。你可以在 Manjaro 中使用以下命令轻松安装。

pacman -Syyupacman -S yay


现在，让我们看看如何使用 Yay 安装任何软件包，以及一些基本的 yay 用法。

如何使用 Yay 安装包

首先在 AUR 网站上搜索安装任何应用以获取包名。例如，要安装 featherpad 文本编辑器，请运行以下命令。

yay -S featherpad


安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到应用启动器。



一些 Yay 的技巧

你还可以使用 yay 进行许多调整和系统操作。下面是一些示例。

刷新系统包并升级：

yay -Syu


使用包的开发版本并升级（运行此命令时要小心）：

yay -Syu --devel --timeupdate


删除任何包（例如，featherpad）：

yay -Rns featherpad


快速获取系统统计信息：



yay -Ps


我希望这个初学者指南能帮助你在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay，然后使用 Yay 安装包，并执行不同的系统操作。

Does Bionic Reading actually work? We timed over 2,000 readers and the results might surprise you.
Daniel Doyon | 19 Jul 2022
tl;dr. Actually no, the results will probably not surprise you. After analyzing data from 2,074 testers, we found no evidence that Bionic Reading has any positive effect on reading speed. In fact, participants read 2.6 words per minute slower on average with Bionic Reading than without. That said, the difference here is so small (less than 1%), that the real takeaway is Bionic Reading has no impact on reading speed.
In June 2022, we posted an experiment to Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter to test the claim that Bionic Reading enables you to read faster without any loss of comprehension.

大家有没有发现这个有趣的现象，在研发过程中，不管开发自测的多完善，验收标准多完备，QA 总能发现更多缺陷。哪怕是一个在线上已经稳定运行很久的既有系统，QA 一来立马搞挂了。有时候不得不感慨，QA 好像柯南一样具备招虫体质，这发现更多 bug 的脑子是怎么长的？
本文就来讨论一下，这种能发现更多 bug 的思路是如何形成的，QA 们都是如何破坏软件功能的。

项目地址见nvim-lsp-loader。
写这个插件的目的是解耦 nvim 配置和 language server 配置，因为使用 packer.nvim 管理插件的话，每次修改 language server 配置都要执行nvim +PackerCompile，不够方便。
目前已支持的功能：
从json文件自动加载 language server ；
支持不同项目定制化的配置，只需在项目根目录下创建.nvim/languages.json即可；
支持默认配置文件，默认配置文件路径为~/.config/nvim/languages.json；
计划支持的功能：
支持动态加载lua文件中的配置；
提供友好的用户命令接口，方便管理和调试；
已知限制：
不要在同一个 nvim 进程中打开两个及以上项目的文件，可能会导致 server 配置混乱。
使用方法见 README 。欢迎 PR ，issue 和 star~</span>

                              <span>AlphaTauriHonda: 中移动国际最近出了精品网，CMIN2 。还开了发布会。以下 CMIN2 简称 58807 。
其中发布会胶片上有个叫做 Premium DIA 的服务。相比另外一个 Premium Transit 服务多了 CT/CU 方向优化。也就是电信联通直连。
几天前 58807 我粗略测了一下，发现电信，联通连接 58807 乱绕，电信绕 AS2914 NTT AS174 Cogent ，联通绕 AS1299 Telia 。
按照中移动发布会的说法，以后 AS9808 会有独立跨境通道连接 58807 ，给中国的 VIP 用户使用。之后应该会像上海电信 AS4812 一样，一部分 IP 上游是 CN2 ，变成国际精品网来卖。
刚才又重新看了下 58807 的 IP 。目前 58807 没有下游，以后应该会有 AS9808 。
找到了以下几段优化了电信和联通的 IP
电信直连 CMI （ AS58453 ）再转 58807 ，联通无优化：223.120.134.0-223.120.135.255


电信联通连 CTG 的 CN2GIA 再转 58807：223.120.165.0-255

58807 其他的 IP 目前应该都没有直连电信联通。
现在 58807 的优化 IP 在联通方向甚至比不过 CMI 的优化 IP 。前两个 IP 联通是绕美国的，最后一个 IP 也要绕电信 CN2 。反观 CMI 的优化 IP ，比如 223.119.187.1 ，是直连香港联通 AS10099 。顺便提一下，移动在境外的运营商服务使用的 IP 也有电信联通优化，优化方式略有不同，但都比 58807 的联通绕美国或者绕 CN2 好。

看来移动的新精品网 58807 还有很大的提升空间。等等看🧱内 AS9808 上的 58807 用户体验如何。</span>

起因是手痒升级了 MacOS13 的测试版，期初用着都挺正常，clash 设置这些也没问题
后来因为工作需要，安了 IOA （腾讯办公软件），IOA 安装后把 Clash 从顶部状态栏给干掉了，导致之前 Clash 里有一项“设置为系统代理”的选项无法关闭。
之后很诡异的一幕就出现了，IOA 访问网络需要设置代理，但系统代理被 Clash 设置了，IOA 就不让链接网络。有线网络里可以通过高级设置禁用系统代理正常使用。但 MacOS13 的 WIFI 设置里，没有之前的高级设置了，也就无法关闭代理导致 Wifi 无法正常访问网络
IOA 卸载，Clash 重装这些都试过了均没有解决问题。甚至因为重装 Clash 导致配置文件丢失，不安装 IOA 时 Wifi 网络也是废的，求大佬支招！</span>

写在前面：
---这款插件主要用户是谁？有多语言场景(项目支持中文、英文、日文、韩文等多种语言)的前端开发者。
---我的项目没有多语言场景，安装你这个插件干嘛？可以体验一下嘛，然后看看源码，插件包含的知识点还有趣的。
---包含哪些知识点呢？ 1.完整的 VSCode 插件开发流程 2.tsc 编译 ts 文件 3.VSCode 文件热更新监测 4.利用缓存增量编译文件

演示图
https://imgur.com/tO0oXjk.gif
两种方式
i18n-json: 适用于 locales 文件类型为 json 的项目。
i18n-ts: 适用于 locales 文件类型为 ts file 的项目。
安装及使用
插件市场搜索 i18n-chain ，安装即可
配置多语言文件目录 Preferences-&gt;Settings-&gt;User-&gt;Extensions-&gt;i18n-chain(例如，配置 Locale Path ，默认路径为 /src/locales/zh)
Command+Shift+P &#x3D;&gt; i18n-json(Locale Path 目录中的内容为 json 文件) 或者 Command+Shift+P &#x3D;&gt; i18n-ts （ Locale Path 目录中的内容为 ts 文件）
键入 i18n-后选择需要的链即可。
例如：
{
  &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;知道了&quot;,
  &quot;foo.bar&quot;: &quot;知道了&quot;,
  &quot;foo.bar.baz&quot;: &quot;知道了&quot;,
}

i18n-知道了

&#x3D;&gt; 
1.foo

2.foo.bar

3.foo.bar.baz


&#x3D;&gt;
foo.bar.baz

docker 镜像是 dko0/squoosh:1.12.0 或者 dko0/squoosh:latest 。
docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/dko0/squoosh
GitHub: https://github.com/hellodk34/squoosh
安全，图片只在本地浏览器，不会上传到任何服务器
高效，squoosh 压缩效率惊人，图片品质却没有损失多少，配合各种压缩选项和品质设置，自由度很高。这波必须赞美 https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh
之前看到这个帖子 压缩图片文件大小有什么好的方案？ 我刚好有这个需求，于是在 docker hub 搜了一下发现居然没有可用的镜像，试了几个跑不起来，比如 downloads 最多的 https://hub.docker.com/r/victor141516/squoosh 。然后只好自己动手。
使用 docker buildx build ，支持 amd64 arm64 和 arm v7 架构，应该满足绝大多数用户的使用场景了。
# docker buildx build -f ./Dockerfile -t NAMESPACE/squoosh:1.12.0 --platform&#x3D;linux/arm64,linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7 .

此镜像使用起来非常简单，一句搞定。
# docker run -d --name squoosh \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 7701:8080 \
    dko0/squoosh:1.12.0

然后访问 http://YOUR_IP:7701 即可。


我测试了一个 10MB 的风景图片（ iPhone 12 拍摄），直接压缩到了 739KB ，quality 是默认的 75 ，支持打开文件或者直接从剪贴板 control/command + V ，体验真不错。现在写博客使用自己的图床，以后贴图可以多考虑考虑压缩一下图片体积了。

欢迎使用。</span>

今天点了个外卖，过了半小时还没骑士赶往商家，就申请退单了。
然后商家不同意，又过了 10 分钟发现还是没骑手，于是商家主动联系我让我选客服介入，原因写无骑士接单申请退款。
接着我写了，提交完发现出现了一个骑手正在赶往商家？？同时送达时间往后顺延了半小时？
这是饿了么的系统策略吗？最后造成了一个顾客骑手商家都不满意的局面😒</span>

Design Thinking has been getting a lot of attention over the past few years as a way to enhance your problem solving, ensure learning goals are met, and increase team engagement. As a concept, it&#x27;s all about problem solving, but it&#x27;s designed to break down existing approaches and norms. Over the past few decades, teams have developed standardized ways of approaching problems. Agile teams, for example, take retrospectives as a means to both troubleshoot and brainstorm new ways of working. Lean has evolved a set of root cause analysis tooling and techniques to allow for the bottoming out of problems.

React is a UI framework built on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where JavaScript (JS) is responsible for most of the logic. If you have knowledge of variables, data types, array functions, callbacks, scopes, string methods, loops, and other JS DOM manipulation-related topics, these will tremendously speed up the pace of learning ReactJS.
Your concept of modern JavaScript will dictate the pace of how soon you can get going with ReactJS. You don&#x27;t need to be a JavaScript expert to start your ReactJS journey, but just as knowledge of ingredients is a must for any chef hoping to master cooking, the same is true for learning ReactJS.

                              <span>北京时间7月19日晚上，英国出现了史无前例的大范围酷热高温，伦敦希斯罗机场升至40.2度，为1841年英国有气象观测以来全国首次超过40度；伦敦市区气象站几乎全部超过39度，全部打破历史纪录。7月20日可看作南方高温的大回归日，而7月22日可看做新一轮北方高温的大开启日。从这天起，我国的第一火炉吐鲁番将重新“开炉”，从40度开始往上飚，到本周末至少上望45度，且还有很大的上调空间；随后，干热气团将自西向东，逐渐侵入陕甘宁、内蒙古，在华北和湿热气流会师后，在强力北抬的副高驱使下，觊觎东北。

The electric rebirth of Scout, the classic off-road SUV brand, is getting real this week as Volkswagen names Scott Keogh as CEO of its new spinoff company. The former head of VW Group America, as initially reported by Axios, pushed for VW to start a new electric truck line after seeing a fully restored vintage Scout: “the rights to the brand were just sitting there,” Keogh said.
VW acquired the Scout brand through a 2020 merger of its commercial trucking company Traton with Navistar, which the German automaker initially bought part of in 2016. In May, it was reported that VW Group is willing to pump $1 billion into the new Scout brand and set goals to sell a quarter million electric off-roaders under the name annually starting in 2026.

Samsung has provided a clear solution to the unusual puzzle it provided yesterday, confirming that its Galaxy Unpacked event will indeed take place on August 10th. The image included with the teaser also confirms that its foldables will be taking center stage, with a Galaxy Z Flip-shaped device acting as a “greater than” symbol. The event will start at 9AM ET and will be streamed on Samsung.com. 
Based on the cryptic hint that Samsung dropped yesterday, along with the timing of last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Fold 3 launch, it was kind of a no-brainer to assume that we’d see updated foldable phones next month. If the phone in the invitation image is actually the Z Flip 4, then rumors that the device would feature minimal updates appear...

Another Samsung Unpacked virtual event is right around the corner, now confirmed to take place on August 10th at 9AM ET / 6AM PT, and along with it are some incentives for the early, early birds. Samsung is offering customers in the US the chance to put in free, no-commitment reservations for its upcoming devices on its website now, well ahead of preorders — and even the devices’ announcement. 
Galaxy fans who reserve before the August 10th Unpacked will later receive varying tier-levels of store credit once the devices can be ordered, ranging from $30 to $200, toward Samsung’s next devices. As for what devices you’re signing up for? We can say with certainty that among the rumors, leaks, and Samsung’s own invite graphic, you can expect...

Netflix’s upcoming ad-supported offering won’t include all of the content you can currently watch on the streaming service, Netflix executives said during the company’s Q2 2022 earnings interview video. 
“Today, the vast majority of what people watch on Netflix, we can include in the ad-supported tier,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said. “There are some things that don’t — that we’re in conversation about with the studios on — but if we launched the product today, the members in the ad tier would have a great experience. We will clear some additional content, but certainly not all of it, but we don’t think it’s a material holdback to the business.” 
“It’s certainly a nice to have,” said CFO Spencer Neumann. “But it’s not a must-have. As...

After Netflix reported losing subscribers for the first time in over a decade last quarter, the company’s Q2 earnings report revealed the number of worldwide subscribers dipped by 1 million, including a drop of 1.28 million in the US and Canada alone between the end of March and the end of June. That’s better than its projection of losing 2 million worldwide, but the subscriber shortfall in the US and Canada is double the 600,000 drop it reported for Q1. Netflix now reports it has 73.28 million paid subscribers in the US and Canada and 220.67 million worldwide. 
This comes nearly a week after Netflix announced a partnership with Microsoft on its cheaper ad-supported tier that it expects to launch by early next year. In the letter,...

Instagram’s latest update aims to make it easier for users to find local businesses or attractions by adding a searchable map that lets you “discover popular local businesses near you,” according to an Instagram Story from Mark Zuckerberg. The map will show you a list of places nearby and will let you see posts about a certain place or see only certain types of business.
There are a few ways to get to the map — if someone tags a place in a post or story, you can tap on the tag and hit “see location” to get to the location’s page. If you move around on the map, you’ll then be able to search the area to see what’s nearby.

Amazon’s current Echo lineup offers a broad selection of smart speakers and displays that can fit just about anywhere in your home. Whether you want to place a voice assistant in your living room, replace the bulletin board in your office, or pick up a touchscreen-enabled device to showcase recipes in the kitchen, there&#x27;s an Echo device for just about every occasion and use case. 
Regardless of why you might want one, there’s also always a way to save on an Echo device, from the last-gen Dot to the wall-mounted Echo Show 15. Even when they’re selling at full price, for instance, Amazon offers a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices, meaning there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are on sale.

Last year, I decided to start learning Korean. It was entirely on a whim — I don’t live in Korea and have no reason I’d ever need to go there. Nonetheless, it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I’ve gotten to a point where I can speak, read, and write comfortably much faster than I ever thought I could. 
That’s entirely due to the wealth of apps and online services out there that I’ve been able to take advantage of. Without easy access to native speakers or in-person classes, much of my early journey involved scouring the internet for resources and trying every one I could find. Here, I’m going to briefly discuss my experience with each one and whether I’d recommend it for its price. 
It’s important that I make a few caveats...

In a trio of images posted to its official Twitter account, Samsung Mobile appears to have confirmed the date of its next Unpacked event as August 10th, 2022. 
The first image presents a grid of letters, numbers, and symbols, while the second shows the same grid replaced with colored circles. Match the characters to the colors, and you can decode the message on the third image as 081022 — aka August 10th, 2022.

This date lines up with a recent leak from from Evan Blass, who published an image from Samsung that also suggested a launch even on August 10th.

Vizio was once the de facto recommendation for TV shoppers looking to spend under $1,000 on a new set. But over the last several years, companies like TCL and Hisense have made their presence felt in the mid-range price segment that was long Vizio’s specialty —  and sometimes with better performance.
It didn’t help that Vizio hit some snags with its 2020 TV lineup (particularly in the area of next-gen 4K gaming), requiring multiple firmware updates to get those TVs where they needed to be for the most demanding gamers. So it makes sense that the company took its time with the 2023 models being announced today. 
What’s not being refreshed are Vizio’s highest-end sets. The 65- and 75-inch P-Series Quantum, 85-inch P-Series Quantum X, and...

Amazon is taking legal action against the admins of over 10,000 Facebook groups that it says facilitate fake reviews for products on its platform by promising money or free products in exchange for positive reviews. The groups are allegedly responsible for fake reviews across Amazon’s sites in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan, the company has announced. Just one such group, called “Amazon Product Review,” reportedly had over 43,000 members.
The e-commerce giant has a well-documented problem with fake reviews, which has grown more pressing as third-party marketplace sellers make up a bigger and bigger proportion of sales on its platform. It officially banned incentivized reviews in October 2016, but four years later in...

A proposed class action lawsuit is taking aim at Apple Pay, claiming that Apple has an illegal monopoly over contactless payments on the iPhone, letting it force card issuers into paying fees (via Bloomberg). The suit is being kicked off by Iowa-based Affinity Credit Union, which issues debit and credit cards that are compatible with Apple Pay, but the company’s lawyers hope to make it a class-action case so other card issuers can join the lawsuit.
According to the complaint, which you can read in full below, Apple makes over $1 billion a year charging credit card companies up to 0.15 percent per transaction in Apple Pay fees, and yet those same card issuers don’t have to pay anything when their customers use “functionally identical...

The Japanese-Canadian artist, who recently moved his studio from Brooklyn to Queens, centers his practice around storytelling and honing in on the distinctive energies of those he paints.
Much of Okamura’s portraiture develops in series, whether as the Healthcare Heroes collection devoted to the nurses and doctors working tirelessly throughout the pandemic or the commanding figures of the ongoing Women Warriors—many of these works will be on view as a solo exhibition in September of 2023 at Pittsburgh’s August Wilson African American Cultural Center.

He was hoping to capture the ominous shelf cloud leading that night’s torrent but instead found himself witnessing an unusually lucky sight: as the rain broke during twilight, a double rainbow emerged over the horizon, an already stunning phenomenon made more serendipitous when it was punctured by a bright lightning bolt in the distance.

                              <span>我非常贪恋睡眠，因为我每天都会做梦，并且第二天起来，我几乎都记得自己做了什么梦。无论是好梦、荒诞的梦、还是噩梦，我都会贪恋其中不愿意起床，它们仿佛短暂的解开了我的脚铐手链，让我飞了一会，飞到了一个和我的真实生活完全不一样的世界。
如果我放任自己开始苏醒，真实生活里的点点滴滴，就会像早晨洗脸被拧开的水龙头的水一样，涌入大脑还泄流不止。一睁开眼睛就开始思考真实生活，真是一件悲伤的事。所以当我不得不起床之后，我总会尽我所能留住那种和现实脱节的感觉，能留多久是多久。能暂时不展开真实生活的点点面相，就暂时不展开。
这种不展开的方式，于我而言就是阅读、纯粹的写作、或者看电影。阅读，是掉入另一个人的大脑去看 TA 写出来的世界；写作，是掉入自己的思想，内观自己的思绪世界；有时我也会一起床先看一部电影。电影，啊，电影，那就是另一个人的故事了，与我完全没有关系的陌生人的生活。这些都是逃离，让我暂时不必被真实生活的清单事项所淹没。
也因此，我的生活在某个节点，被分割成了「之前」和「之后」，这个节点的划分，于我而言就是开微信：查收微信消息的那一刻，就代表着我被拉回现实，开始需要处理跟真实生活息息相关的消息、通知、事项。我上午从不开微信，一般看微信都是下午1点后了。当然，这种回归现实的方式，也是循序渐进式的：1点前后，我会第一次开微信，只是纯粹接收消息，确认无要紧之事后，又立刻关闭微信。直到下午3点我的微信才正式处于常开状态，表示我正式接受来自真实生活里清单事项的随时打扰，繁碎日常正式拉开序幕。
我现在颇享受这种隔离时段式的生活节奏，3点之前专注创作，3点之后回归生活，「回归」这个词已经说明，我刻意与真实生活保持距离的个人态度。我的一天于是就这样拥有了两幅面孔：上午，是流离于真实生活的异想世界，下午，是落地于真实生活的现实世界。那晚上呢？
晚上，是所有互联网产品必争的时段，也是人最情绪化，情感状态最饱满的时候。这个时刻，我又有了一种脱离真实生活的漂浮感，但它和上午的「脱离」还不太一样。上午的脱离感是我刻意营造的，晚上的脱离感则是浑然天成的。它是异想世界和真实生活经过漫长一天的交织、杂融、沉淀之后形成的，自带一种未经雕琢的生野感，能随时将你吞噬，将你包围，张力如此之强，让你无处遁型。所以，人才会多半选择在晚上谈情做爱，那种呼之欲出、溢都溢不住的原始本能，不仅是商家必争，也是艺术家必争。这个最容易飘的时段，我觉得也是最能体现我与自己是否真的自洽的时刻。你能多大程度上接受自己的各种情绪？允许它？放任它？还是压制它？抵制它？与晚上的相处，具有了一种哲学感：是什么？为什么？你想干什么？
可惜，到现在我依然还在摸索与深夜的相处之道：「情绪那么饱满，你总不能浪费吧？」脑子里这个声音颇为强烈，总觉得我应该物尽其用。可每一天的晚上都不太一样，今晚如蜜糖般的度过方式，放在明天也许就是砒霜。何为物尽其用？更何况，多数时候，夜晚让我觉得自己过得失败而忙碌，怎么又是一个颗粒无收，或效果甚微的一天？所以我现在会想，或者，选择给夜晚注入理性哲思，本身就是一个错误，所以我才会屡战屡败，跟它过得如此拧巴。
那不如，就让上午承担想象，下午承担事项，晚上它什么也别承担了。就如情绪，它最需要的也许就只是被看见。也别绞尽脑汁赋予它什么意义，哪有那么多事需要意义？
所以，我总结出了什么吗？我享受我割裂的三段式生活节奏，我给「幻想」和「现实」各自独立的空间，并保证雨露均沾。至于晚上，我不为难它，它也不必为难我。三十后的“自处之道”，大抵如此。</span>

                              <span>这两天在Reddit上看到一个关于「AirPlay 2 on Linux」的帖子，其中推荐了 Shairport Sync 项目，于是我打算给家里在用的树莓派的AirPlay升级一下。大家有能力的可以直接去看原文，里面文档写的很详细。
准备

一台Linux 或 FreeBSD的设备，其性能至少要大于等于树莓派 2
319 和 320端口没有被占用
一个音箱（最好是3.5mm接口）

开始安装
首选建议大家先将系统更新到最新状态，可以大大减少许多莫名其妙的问题。
sudo apt-get update #检查更新
sudo apt-get upgrade #执行更新
关闭Wi-Fi节能管理
如果你使用设备使用Wi-Fi连接的话，需要将节能管理关闭，可以避免安装后设备进入节能后搜索不到音箱。
iwconfig wlan0 power off
安装依赖
以下是Shairport Sync需要依赖
apt install --no-install-recommends build-essential git xxd xmltoman \ 
autoconf automake libtool libpopt-dev libconfig-dev libasound2-dev \ 
avahi-daemon libavahi-client-dev libssl-dev libsoxr-dev libplist-dev \ 
libsodium-dev libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev uuid-dev libgcrypt-dev
nqptp
nqptp是 Shairport Sync 监控时间的重要依赖，需要手动编译安装。

                              <span>近日，少数派首页出现了一篇名为《把握浏览器的「门面」：少数派作者们都在用什么启动页？》的文章。在文章中，几位作者分别介绍了自己喜欢的浏览器启动页插件，评论区也有很多读者分享了自己的解决方案。
可以看出，关于浏览器 newtab 的花样确实很多。网址导航、todolist、番茄钟……各种玩法都很有趣。可我和大家的喜好偏偏相反，我特别钟情于纯空白页，讨厌 newtab 中出现任何元素。🌚
Chrome 浏览器的 newtab 在默认情况下，由早期的空白页不知道什么时候开始变成了 Google 搜索框：
默认 chrome://newtab
如果你想去掉这个搜索框，解决办法是在 Chrome 设置中把地址栏搜索引擎从 Google 改成其他。这时候你会发现， Google 搜索框确实是不见了，可 newtab 的内容又变成了 8 个历史记录中的网站，还关不掉。删掉以后又会出来新的 8 个网站。容易泄露隐私的同时，它给出的建议也不一定用得上……
修改搜索引擎后的 chrome://newtab
而 Edge 这边的情况更加离谱：
Edge 不知是从哪里得来的设计灵感，newtab 变成了新闻股票大杂烩，用户挣 kuī 钱吃瓜两不误。可能是担心瓜的热度太高，造成吃瓜群众中暑，还贴心为你展示了天气信息。
默认 edge://newtab
好在 Edge 可以关闭这个 newtab 中大部分的内容，但最后还剩 bing 搜索框无法去除。左下角还有增值电信业务经营许可证号，真的是想逼死强迫症。🥲
关闭内容展示后的 edge://newtab
1.安装 Super Evil New Tab Redux
为此我找到了「Super Evil New Tab Redux」这款 Chrome 插件，我的需求才得以解决。这款插件可以为 newtab 设置背景色，可以添加自定义 HTML、CSS、JS 代码。
Super Evil New Tab Redux 选项
插件地址：Chrome 网上应用店
插件接管 newtab 之后，默认背景是黑色的，建议修改 Background Color 为白色，或者设置 RGB 值为：255 255 255，这样你就会收获一个纯净的 newtab：

2.修改源文件
虽然 newtab 变纯净了，但还是有一点点不完美：由于 newtab 被第三方插件接管，因此新建标签页时，标签页左侧 favicon 从  Chrome 图标变成了插件图标，看上去有一些违和。这时我发现插件本身已经开源，可以简单修改一下文件就能达到最理想的效果。

2.1 修改newtab.html文件
下载源码并解压，打开 newtab.html文件。
将第 6 行代码中的New Tab修改为：新标签页。
2.2 修改插件 icons
去网络中寻找 Chrome 图标，比如在 iconfont 网站中就可以搜到很多这样的图标。
iconfont
选择一个你喜欢的图标，分别下载尺寸为 512、128、96、48、32、16 的 png 文件。打开插件源码中的「icons」文件夹，按照其中的文件命名规律，对刚刚下载的图标文件重新命名，替换原文件。
替换后的 icons
chrome://newtab 默认 favicon 是灰色的，我使用的是彩色 Chrome 图标，你也可以选择原风格的图标。
2.3 修改 options.html 文件
顺手对options.html进行简单的汉化，使用起来更加直观。

3.载入修改版插件
在 Chrome 中打开 chrome://extensions 页面，开启右上方的「开发者模式」。点击「加载已解压的扩展程序」，选取你刚才修改的 Super Evil New Tab Redux 源代码文件夹。此时经过修改后的插件就可以使用了。

最终效果
经过修改的 newtab 样式已经彻底融入了 Chrome，完全看不出一点违和感。
修改后的 newtab 样式修改后的插件选项
插件同样适用于所有 Chromium 内核浏览器，载入方法也是一样的。
Edge 浏览器使用效果
Edge 浏览器载入该插件后，彩色图标莫名其妙变成了黑白色，但是不影响使用。建议 Edge 用户在上文步骤 2.2 中搜索 Edge 图标进行替换。
Edge：我生气了，哄不好的那种。🙃
你还可以把修改后的插件进行备份，或者放进系统引导盘，让它成为你的装机必备。❤️</span>

然而由于各种原因，我无法将所有我想分享的内容撰成整篇的文章，所以我想通过「档案室」这个系列，不定期记录、分享一些我认为值得分享的、最近在读/听/思考的一些事情，也希望能由此产生一些有趣的讨论。
在看的一本书
《可能性的艺术》 by 刘瑜
刘瑜的几本大众向的书我都看过了，包括《民主的细节》、《观念的水位》、《送你一颗子弹》，这些都是好多年前看的了，具体的内容肯定是不记得的，但是当时看的心情似乎还能想起一些——她的文字简单但清醒、深刻但不做作、知识量又巨大（至少对于非政治学出生的我而言），恰到好处的升华也总是让人读完有畅快之感。
这种感觉我之前似乎忘了，但是在读《可能性的艺术》时，那种感觉又回来了。而且阅读她的书，不仅仅能有知识上的收获——如果你对政治学感兴趣的话——还能有思维方式和写作技巧上的收获。
对于《可能性的艺术》这本书，我认为至少有三个角度来阅读这本书。
第一，是了解「比较政治学」的基本理念及背后的背景知识。通过比较理解政治，比较不同国家在国家能力、国家转型、文化政治发展等不同方面的兴盛衰退及其背后的原因，来理解世界为什么是这个样子。
其中有一个知识上的收获，是让我觉得最值得，也是让我受到震撼的——对于和平的认识。 
在《可能性的艺术》里，有一章叫「和平的爆发」。「爆发」这个词在这里似乎有些不合时宜，但纵观人类历史，和平时代其实是非常短暂的，充满了大规模战争的年代才是「常态」，而我们只是非常幸运地出生在和平的几十年、和平的国家，我们思考的问题是明年要去哪里玩，而不是明天…</span>

Some advice can be a vice. Feel free to take what you can use, and leave the rest.

之前听博主万卉说，人约等于计算机的思维框架对她很管用，她会把时间分成输入、处理、交互、输出这四块，健康的体魄与高效的大脑是好的硬件基础，知行合一意味着好的交互的匹配度，独立思考需要我们拥有好的信息处理能力。
这个思维方式也对我非常有启发，我据此优化了自己日常生活的记录方式。而我目前生活的重心是在输入这一块，我很珍惜自己阅读、听播客的时光，它们在我看来就和玩耍一样有趣，我能持续收获有趣与新奇的感觉，这也让我想到硅谷投资人纳瓦尔Naval所说的：

要想有所专长，就要追求真正的兴趣和热爱，累积专长的过程，对你而言就像玩耍，对他人来说则很吃力。

关于输入，一方面我会筛选自己的信息源，去有意识地主动输入，关于这点想和大家分享张潇雨老师在播客中提到的一个「企鹅理论」，非常形象生动，大致是说：人的大脑是一片冰川，每个记忆点都是一只企鹅。冰川面积有限，每有一只垃圾企鹅进入冰川上，冰川上原有的企鹅就会掉进海洋，所以不要让无用无趣的企鹅，挤掉生动有趣的企鹅。

让我们聊聊最近大热的人工智能（AI）艺术创作。 在艾厂的人工智能国际论坛进行的五月底（以至后来的六月），还发生着另外一件颇相关的重要事件——两款主要的人工智能图像生成软件，DALL·E·2 和 Midjourney，都开始开放测试版的内部邀请。沙丘的成员也获得了 Midjourney 的邀请，进入了测试版的 Discord 社群，得以观察到无数图像的生成、筛选与调校，也尝试了自己输入的提示词（prompt）以生成 AI 图像。
在预想当中，我们以为 AI 图像的生成界面是一个简洁的提示词输入框加上图像生成页——类似于谷歌图片搜索页面，只是「搜索结果」换成了「生成成果」。然而实际情况却是，所有 Midjourney 受邀的测试新人都将加入一个 Discord 社群，这个大社群下又进一步细分出五十个「新人群」。当新人加入的时候，Midjourney 的机器人（bot）将会首先自动在「通告群」中发出消息，指定某某新人到第 XX 号新人群中。
在这一「群聊」的机制中，用户将以适当格式输入提示词——譬如「一颗柠檬戴着墨镜，躺在沙滩上休息，摄影级真实风格」，而机器人将在约一分钟后，在群聊界面里回复依照提示词生成的四张 AI 图像，并在新消息中提及（@）新人。值得注意的是，这意味着所有用户要求的图像——不管是输入的提示词，还是生成出来的图像，都将对所有人可见。

4 月份的时候，ZDNet 称其测试版为“你将使用的最可爱的 Linux 发行版”，称赞这个精雕细琢的基于 Debian 的 Cutefish OS “难以置信的优雅”，带有类似于 MacOS 的整洁的桌面。而我们 早已知道，这个由国内团队开发的桌面，已经失联一段时间了。有一些爱好者发起了复刻 Cutefish DE 的行动。而现在，国际开源社区也注意到了这一情况，并已经有一些社区在努力了。比如 OpenMandriva 试图给他们的发行版增加一个 Cutefish DE 桌面环境；Arch Linux 社区也有了独立的 Cutefish DE 软件包。

因无法找到合适的供应商，字节跳动考虑自研芯片

字节跳动公司发言人今天证实，该公司正在探索可供自身在专业领域使用的芯片设计，因为该公司无法找到能够满足其要求的供应商。这些芯片将用来处理该公司在多个业务领域的相关工作负荷，包括视频平台、信息和娱乐应用。此举标志着字节跳动将加入一系列研发半导体的中国互联网巨头行列。过去几年，包括百度、阿里巴巴在内的许多公司都发布了自己设计的芯片。不过，他们仍需要台积电等代工商来帮助其生产芯片。字节跳动还表示，不会将其芯片销售给其他公司。

                              <span>了解一下自由软件基金会（FSF）。


早在 1985 年，自由软件基金会（FSF）就开始提倡源代码共享的理念，并从此打响了为计算机用户和开发者捍卫权利的斗争。FSF 认为，用“开放Open”和“封闭Closed”这两个词来划分软件，十分具有局限性；于是，在为程序分类时，转而使用了以下词语：尊重自由（这个“自由free”或这个“自由Libre”）或践踏自由（“非自由non-free”或“专有proprietary”）。不管用语如何，关键之处在于，计算机必须受用户控制，而不是任由开发了计算机软件的公司来摆布。正因如此，GNU 工程、Linux 内核、Freedesktop.org 等众多自由软件项目，才会如此重要。

最近，FSF 新上任了一位执行董事，她叫 Zoë Kooyman。我初见 Zoë 时，是在 2019 年的一个 All Things Open 大会上。当然，那个时候她还不是 FSF 的执行董事，不过已经在管理 FSF 不断增长的重大活动了 —— 包括 LibrePlant。她之前递给我了一份自由软件作者的名单，名单长得一眼望不尽，而且那些软件都是我每天在用的。由此，我也很受她那充沛的精力和诚恳的态度所打动。我只是偶然参加了一次 FSF 的聚会，但最后却和那些人成了朋友。是他们让我的数字生活有了意义，是他们保障了我能够拥有 Zoë 和 FSF 所说的 四项基本自由：


无论用户出于何种目的，用户必须可以按照自己的意愿，自由地运行该软件（自由之零）。

用户可以自由地学习并修改该软件，使它按照你的意愿进行计算（自由之一）。作为前提，用户必须可以得到该软件的源代码。

用户可以自由地分发该软件的副本，这样就可以帮助别人（自由之二）。

用户可以自由地分发该软件修改后的副本（自由之三）。借此，用户可以把改进后的软件分享给整个社区，令他人也从中受益。作…</span>

                              <span>这是一个可能的情景。你的系统收到了内核更新，但不知何故，事情不像以前那样顺利。

你意识到，如果你启动到较旧的内核（是的，你可以降级内核），一切都会恢复正常。

高兴之余你会觉得有点儿不爽。因为你不得不在每次启动时手动选择较旧的内核。

一位年长的读者遇到了这个问题。Linux Mint 中的新内核更新没有按预期工作。启动到较旧的内核“修复”了问题，但麻烦的是在每次启动时要去手动选择较旧的内核。

删除新内核而使用旧内核不是一个好主意，因为新内核将会在下一次系统更新时被安装使用。

因此，我建议设置成默认启动到较旧的 Linux 内核。怎么做？这就是我将在本教程中向你展示的内容。

启动至较旧的 Linux 内核

你可能不了解，你的 Linux 发行版会在你的系统上安装多个 Linux 内核。不信？使用以下命令 列出 Ubuntu 中已安装的内核：

apt list --installed | grep linux-image


当你升级系统时会获得一个新版本的内核，这时你的系统会自动选择启动至最新的可用内核。

在 grub 屏幕中，你可以转到高级选项Advanced option（较旧的 Linux 版本）：



在这里，你可以看到要启动的可用内核。选择较旧的（不带恢复选项recovery option 的条目）：



你不会注意到任何显示的差异。你的文件和应用程序保持不变。

现在你已经启动到旧内核，是时候让你的系统自动启动到它了。

使旧内核成为默认启动项

如果你乐于使用 Linux 终端和命令，你可以修改 /etc/default/grub 文件并在其中添加以下行：

GRUB_DEFAULT&#x3D;saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT&#x3D;true


然后使用如下命令 更新 GRUB：

sudo update-grub


你在这里所做的是告诉你的系统将当前使用的启动项保存为将来运行 GRUB 的默认启动项。

然而，并不是每个人都善于使用命令行，因此我将专注于一个名为 Grub Customizer 的 GUI 工具。

安装 Grub Customizer

使用官方 PPA 在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Grub Customizer：

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer
sudo apt update
sudo apt install grub-customizer


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器来安装此工具。

使用 Grub Customizer 更改默认启动项

当你运行 Grub Customizer 时，它会显示可用的启动项。



在这里你有两个选择。

选择一： 选择所需的内核项并使用箭头按钮（显示在顶部菜单上）将其向上移动。



选择二： 将先前的启动项previously booted entry设为默认启动项default entry。



我建议使用第二个选择，因为即使有新的内核更新它也可以工作。

这样你就可以在 Ubuntu 或其他发行版中降级内核，甚至无需删除新内核版本。

请注意，像 Ubuntu 这样的发行版大部分一次只保留两个内核版本。因此，最终你首选的旧内核将在新的内核版本释出时被删除。

这个巧妙的技巧曾助我脱困。当时我 在 Ubuntu 中安装最新的 Linux 内核 ，由于某种原因它与我的音频系统有些兼容问题。

无论是什么原因，你现在都知道如何自动启动到旧内核。

如果有问题或建议，请在评论区留言。

Advantages of AWS Machine Learning
Amazon’s AWS Machine Learning suite of services can help cut down the time and expense it typically takes to develop, test, and deploy ML models. For instance, adding specifics to pre-trained models can help a company quickly deploy a chatbot to help with customer service tasks. AWS also supports all of the major machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and Caffe2. 
It’s also secure, with end-to-end encryption, and provides a “pay-as-you-go” model that allows organizations of all sizes to

Before we begin, let’s make one thing clear: bisect is a tool for debugging regressions. It does nothing for regular bugs. When we have a regression, we typically know that the issue used to work in a specific release, we would typically have a specific revision where the code worked. We would typically know that it doesn’t work in the current version, but which commit along the way causes the failure?
Back in the old days of SVN (or CVS, SourceSafe, etc.) we used to checkout an older version of the repository and test on it. If it failed, we’d go…</span>

In this article You will learn about the tips and tricks of css specificity, specificity ranking, and also learn how calculate css specificity.
An HTML element can have multiple css rules attached to it by matching different CSS selectors. The selector with the highest specificity value will &quot;win&quot;, and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
So basically, specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element.
Let&#x27;s have look at an example
.title {
        background-color: green;
      }
h1 {
     background-color: red;

                              <span>This series explores how we can keep code declarative as we adapt features to progressively higher levels of complexity.

Wrap imperative APIs with declarative ones.
Imperative APIs are better than no APIs, and they tend to precede declarative APIs. Why is that, and what can we do about it?
Declarative code is more comprehensible than imperative code, as you saw in the example in the first article in this series. But in order to write comprehensible code, you have to comprehend what you&#x27;re writing. For example, it&#x27;s easy to declare a variable with a bad name, but writing a comprehensible name requires a comprehension of what that variable represents.

Redhat SSO and Keycloak are both open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools. An Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool smoothens the process of authentication for applications as well as IT services.
Ensuring that the right people in a company have the correct access to resources is the main objective of the IAM tool. It generally permits the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO), identity federation, and strong authentication.
We are living in a digital world where securing the web and applications has shifted towards a necessity. Organizations generally have to spend millions of dollars in the form of various financial penalties for unauthorized access to protected data. All websites and apps re…</span>

                              <span>As a coder, you should always be looking to expand your knowledge. The best way to do this is by learning different coding languages and frameworks. 
I myself am a Javascript and Python fullstack developer and like most self-taught developers, I started by learning HTML, CSS and Javascript first. 
Eventually I learned Python and found it very useful. Python is great for handling backend data and creating simple scripts like web-scrapers.
If you&#x27;re nervous about learning Python, remember that Python is a high level programming language. This means it is around the same level of difficulty to learn as Javascript. 
I would even argue it is easier to learn than javascript, and the transition from Javascript to python much smoother than the other way round.

                              <span>Memoization is a performance optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached results when the same inputs occur again.
In JavaScript, memoization can be used to speed up recursive functions that call the same values multiple times. By storing the results of the function calls, we can avoid having to recalculate them each time, which can lead to significant performance gains.
For example, consider the following recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number:
function fib(n) {
  if (n &lt;&#x3D; 1) {
    return n;
  }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
 }

This function works by recursively calling itself with different values for n. The first time it&#x27;s called, it will calculate the Fibonacci numbers for n &#x3D; 0…</span>

                              <span>here we wanna make a custom mouse with javascript, first step is to make a context for mouse:
import React, { createContext, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;

export const CursorContext &#x3D; createContext();

const CursorContextProvider &#x3D; (props) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const [cursor, setCursor] &#x3D; useState({ active: false });

  return (
    
      {props.children}
    
  );
};

export default CursorContextProvider;

then we make a component for our mouse shape:
import React from &quot;react&quot;;
import useMousePosition from &quot;./useMousePosition&quot;;
const Cursor &#x3D; ({ color, color1, scroll, left, right, drag, pos }) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const { clientX, clientY } &#x3D; useMousePosition();

  return (
    
      
        
      
    
  );
};
export default Cursor;


then we use them in a component
        
          
          {props.children}
         
           mouse shape</span>

While most cloud-native deployments happen with Kubernetes, it becomes necessary to know these service types, when to use what type, and how they work. Today, we will look at the different service types available and how they work in practice.
Below is my other article where I have explained in detail about each service type.

目前的工作需要转换一些 XML 的结构，具体来说的话是这样：
这是转换前的结构，
节点下固定有两个子节点，第一个子节点固定是
，节点的值是 A ，第二个节点固定是
，也固定有两个子节点，不过节点类型没有限制，这两个节点的值是 B 和 C 。准确的来说这个需要转换的结构的判定标准是“
节点下的第 2 个子节点是
”

  
A
  
B
    
C
  
节点下还是固定有两个子节点，第一个子节点替换为固定
，节点的值是 A 和 B ，第二个替换为固定
，节点的值是 C

  
A
    
B
  
C


这样的结构会在 XML 中出现（而不是一整个完整的 XML ），需要找到 XML 中对应的结构并替换。此外也有可能出现嵌套结构的情况，比如这样：

  
A
  
B
      
C
        
D
      
E
  
A
    
B
        
C
      
D
    
E


感觉这是个涉及到数据结构的问题，不过因为没有实际学过所以做起来有点棘手。之前也试过用正则表达式，但是应该不够用，也了解过 XSLT ，似乎也不太能很好的解决问题，目前看来是真的只能用 DOMParser 读取 XML 然后操作树了？这个就真的没什么思路了，求 V 友们指点一下</span>

目前家里用的软路由直装 openwrt ，4 个千兆口的；内网是 2.5g 的。
查阅了一些资料找到的方案
1 、10g epon 的光猫棒，再换一个 r86s 的软路由，不知道是否兼容，而且一下大几千没了 T_T
2 、参考 smzdm 有个文章，wan 口链路聚合（但不知道光猫是否支持），lan 口聚合或者升级软路由
3 、2.5g 的光猫，这个不太了解，支持联通 10g epon 的有哪些价格怎样，似乎也很贵？
想请教下大家，有相关经验的来参谋一下

在本站其他帖子上看到，大家的风扇是在 70 度的时候才转一下的(例如 https://www.v2ex.com/t/762887 的 19 楼)，而我的风扇是 50 度就开始转了，这是为啥呀？

而如果使用命令行的  istats ，(用 sudo gem install istats 安装的)，无法获取到温度是咋回事儿呀？

最后一个问题，在 htop 中，可以看到有两个核心基本占用满了，而在列表中看不到什么占用 CPU 的程序，这是为啥呀？

相信游戏男孩女孩们心中不例外的都有一个自己组装电脑梦，提到组装电脑眼里都有光了
再感慨一句！真的没有游戏玩家可以拒绝自己组装一台电脑的成就感了吧！
下面来分享下我的组装小科普和清单，还没动手的兄弟们（姐妹们也可以）赶快来抄作业
 
首先你要明确需求，组装电脑用来做什么？
目前市面上的机箱、音响等配件美观度都不错，每个人喜欢的类型也不同，就不做介绍了，大家根据自己喜欢的风格配置就可以。
当当当当～以下就是我的成果图，附上我的选购清单给大家参考，总花销大概为 15k
 
屏幕：AOC AGON ，27 寸，170HZ
打游戏光是电脑性能过硬还不够，如果家里网速慢、稳定性差也是很影响游戏体验的，所以路由器也是不容忽视的重要组成部分。
路由器我选择的是 Ubiquiti 的 U6 Mesh ，大家都因其外形称之为“可乐罐”。这个品牌是我在美国留学时了解的，当时租住的公寓使用的是他家面板 ap ，使用体验很好。因为它家产品主要做企业级网络稳定性很妥，而且外观设计特别又好看，机身一圈灯条很炫酷，搭配自己组装的电脑科技感满满，放在电脑桌上很加分。他家的产品，dddd ，可以说网络界的苹果吧。
 
希望大家都可以组装成自己的梦想机！</span>

前端的痛苦
作为前端，最痛苦的是什么时候？
每个迭代，需求文档跟设计稿都出来了，静态页面唰唰两天就做完了。可是做前端又不是简单地把后端吐出来的数据放到页面上就完了，还有各种前端处理逻辑啊。
后端接口还没出来，我就得边写代码边测前端效果，又没有真实数据。有人建议用 Mock 工具，可是每个接口都要自己写 Mock 规则，这得浪费多少时间呀。
等到后端好不容易把接口写出来了，一对接联调，好多字段的数据又跟我 Mock 的数据对不上，又得重新改代码。

每个迭代都是一场折磨。
就是那种，明明知道这个地方整个团队都可以更有效率，但偏偏就是做不到的无力感。
黎明的希望
直到有一天，我遇到这个神器。我的效率提升了 100%。
我可以用最省力最优雅的方式得到我需要的 Mock 数据，甚至不需要任何配置。而且，联调时候曾经遇到的各种令人崩溃的前后端数据对接问题，统统不！见！了！
就是这个⬇️

我研究了整整一周，越研究越是心惊。这个工具太强大，完全超出我的预期，就如《倚天屠龙记》里张无忌修炼的乾坤大挪移，练完一层，上面还有一层，每一层都是一片全新的天地。
我曾经以为，定接口什么的你们后端定就行了，跟我前端有什么关系。定好了吐数据给我就行了。
我曾经以为，写接口文档什么的完全是浪费时间，边写代码边改接口不好嘛。
直到我遇到这个神器，我才明白好的工作习惯能给我提升多少效率。
现在的我已经不一样了。我认为这款神器能够把全中国前端程序员的工作效率都提升一倍。我也希望在读这篇文章的你，能够好好把这款工具用起来。
好，接下来我要发功了。

第一层：智能 Mock
Apifox 是个 API 协作工具，用它来做 Mock 数据的基础也是 API 文档。在 Apifox 里维护的 API 可以生成好看的在线接口文档，也可以像 Postman 那样一键调试，像 JMeter 那样做测试…</span>

之前内部前后端文档都是用 swagger 、yapi 之类的。现在要给一些对外的接口文档，但是是通过 PDF 的形式给出而不是提供一个 Web 平台，而且这个 PDF 内容的结构和格式都要求比较严格，所以都是先写一份 word ，再转成 PDF 。如果遇到参数是 object 的结构，参数表格里面要体现这种嵌套层级的关系感觉就比较麻烦了，缩进、合并单元格之类的领导都觉得不太美观，所以就比较犯难，不知道各位有没有比较好的例子和建议可供参考</span>

预算 500 左右的样子，茶轴，或者类似茶轴的手感也行。
年会中了一个雷蛇的线性轴，试了下不喜欢，键程太短，基本上碰到就触发了，所以就卖掉了。。

这是个吐槽贴。
最近老婆被她老家里的一些事情，弄哭了好几次。真想替她出口恶气啊。。。
人的觉悟有高低，父母对孩子的爱也是有高低的，所以有的人当爹妈就是不及格的。
不及格的爱，在我看来，就是最大的伤害。
童年的伤害，真的要用余生去治愈么？</span>

即，定义某一接口，同时定义多个处理类来实现这个接口，在处理数据时，依次（并行）调用这些处理类，在处理类内部，根据业务需求，判断是否需要进行处理，不处理的直接 return 。
现在的方式是使用策略模式，通过 Autowired 自动注入这些处理类，放入 map ，根据业务类型取出不同的处理类进行处理。
不知这是否是在 spring boot 中的最佳实现方式？
如果同时需要多个处理类进行处理（如上所述），是否只能在自动注入时放入一个 List 中，进行遍历处理？
public interface Strategy {
   Integer getBizCode();
   public int doOperation(int num1, int num2);
}



@Component
public class OperationAdd implements Strategy{
    @Override
    public Integer getBizCode() {
        return 1;
    }

   @Override
   public int doOperation(int num1, int num2) {
      return num1 + num2;
   }
}

@Component
public class OperationSubtract implements Strategy{

    @Override
    public Integer getBizCode() {
        return 2;
    }

   @Override
   public int doOperation(int num1, int num2) {
      return num1 - num2;
   }
}



public class StrategyPatternDemo {

    HashMap strategyMap &#x3D; new HashMap();

    @Autowired
    public StrategyPatternDemo(List strategies){
        for (Strategy strategy : strategies) {
            strategyMap.put(strategy.getCode(),strategy);
        }
    }

   public void test(int type, int num1, int num2) {
        Strategy strategy &#x3D; strategyMap.get(type);
        int result &#x3D; strategy.doOperation(num1, num2);
        System.out.println(result);
   }

                              <span>duoduo1x: Mac Studio 跟 Studio Display 到货了，上手三个小时，简单说下 studio display ；
studio display 的 6 个喇叭也就一般般，听个响吧（比 Macbook air 的好），比我现在用的惠威 H6 差太多了，毕竟底大一级压死人。
摄像头成像感觉比 iPhone 的差，多了人物居中。
Studio Display 显示效果对比我现在的戴尔 U2718Q 要好一些，更加通透、5K 还是比 4K 细腻一丢丢的，看油管 4K 戴尔的颜色比较浓跟深一些，不知道是不是 studio display 亮度比较高的原因。
而 Studio Display 由于是镜面，反光比较严重。
至于 Mac Studio ，这玩意我没啥感觉，因为我很少视频剪辑之类的大型应用，我的要求就是不卡，性能我可以不用，但是必须要有。
早买早享受，如果你不差钱就可以咬咬牙上了。
最后借地询问下 Macbook air i3 处理器(2020 款) 8G 内存 256 硬盘现在还能卖多少钱？
因为我买回来是想着移动、应急用的，但是两年了，出门用了不到十次，在家用得更少，半个月给它充一次电……</span>

最近参加一个创意轨迹跑的活动，大家的路线都是怎么规划的啊？
有没有规划路径的工具可以使用？
如果没有的话，自己做一个不知道能不能行？
给出想要跑的图形或者字，选定跑步范围，用什么技术可以分析出跑步的路线呢？
有大神可以给解答一下吗？</span>

如图，本来 Safari 的翻译功能还挺好用的，可以快速过一些不想细读的外语网站。
最新版的测试系统发现可以翻译图片上的文字了，但效果排版有点凌乱，反而看着不如不翻译效果好。
我好像没找到地方可以设置开关，不知道正式版能不能把这个功能关掉。</span>

I&#x27;ve written, used, and seen a lot of loose scripts in my career. They start with someone that needs to semi-automate some task. After a while, they grow. They can change hands many times in their lifetime. I&#x27;ve often wished for a more command-line tool-like feeling in those scripts. But how hard is it really to bump the quality level from a one-off script to a proper tool? It turns out it&#x27;s not that hard in Python.
Scaffolding
In this article, I start with a little Python snippet. I&#x27;ll drop it into a scaffold module, and extend it with click to accept command-line arguments.

Who wants to create their first UI app? I do, and if you&#x27;re reading this article, I assume you do, too. In today&#x27;s example, I&#x27;ll use some JavaScript and the API with Express I demonstrated in my previous article. First, let me explain some of the tech you&#x27;re about to use.
What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building a user interface (UI). However, you need more than just the UI library for a functional UI. Here are the important components of the JavaScript web app you&#x27;re about to create:

&quot;Explain it to me like I&#x27;m five.&quot;
When you want someone to get to the point as efficiently and as clearly as possible, that&#x27;s what you say. Following that logic, you might be compelled to ponder the most powerful tool the average, everyday 5-year old wields: coloring books. What better way than a coloring book to transform a droll slideshow presentation into a fun and educational journey?
That&#x27;s what artists Máirín Duffy and Madeline Peck thought, anyway, and it has turned out to be accurate. In the past, Máirín has helped produce five open source coloring books to help explain advanced topics including SELinux, Containers, Ansible, and more. …</span>

1. 认识散列表
1.1 散列表的作用
散列算法是散列表的核心，也就做哈希算法或 Hash 算法，是一个意思。散列算法是一种将任意长度输入转换为固定长度输出的算法，输出的结果就是散列值。基于散列算法实现的散列表，可以实现快速查找元素的特性。
总结一下散列算法的主要性质：
性质
描述




1、单向性（基本性质）
支持从输入生成散列值，不支持从散列值反推输入

That’s because Sonos makes speakers that — more often than not — boast great sound quality, support for all the major streaming platforms, and simple multi-room functionality. Unfortunately, however, those perks often come at a high price. Sonos products aren’t cheap, and, outside of the occasional rogue discount, they rarely go on sale. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean there aren’t ways to save at least a few dollars on Sonos gear.
If you’re comfortable buying refurbished, for example, you could save a decent amount. We also occasionally see sales on Sonos’ collaborative series with Ikea and discounted bundles that include Sonos...

Russia imposed a nearly $365 million fine (21.1 billion rubles) on Google for failing to delete YouTube videos that go against the country’s laws, as reported earlier by Reuters. In a translated press release, Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor states that YouTube didn’t follow orders to remove “prohibited content,” which includes videos “promoting extremism and terrorism,” as well as supposedly false information about the war in Ukraine.
In March, the Roskomnadzor threatened to charge Google over its failure to remove “illegal” YouTube videos, stating the fee would start at 8 million rubles (~$94,675 USD at the time), with the possibility to climb to 20 percent of Google’s annual revenue. The 21.1 billion rubles reflects a...

Google Wallet, the app that will replace Google Pay in many countries (more on that in a moment), has started to show up on people’s phones. According to Google spokesperson Chaiti Sen, the company has “started rolling out the Wallet to Android users in 39 countries,” and it’ll be available “to all users over the next few days.”
Google announced Wallet at its 2022 I/O event, pitching it as an app to manage all your digital cards — not just for payment, like debit and credit cards (though it does hold those), but for digital representations of your identification, vaccination status, tickets, keys, and more as well.

This is a saga that has been playing out over several days, so let’s take a few steps back. On July 13th, Unity, which makes a popular game development engine, announced that it would be merging with ironSource, which offers software that helps developers monetize their apps. Riccitiello (who was formerly the CEO of EA) and Unity SVP Marc Whitten were interviewed by Pocket Gamer about the news, and the interviewer talked about how some developers push back on implementing monetization earlier in a game’s development.
That’s where Riccitiello said the “fucking idiots” quote...

HBO has released the first teaser trailer for The Idol, a new show co-created by Sam Levinson, creator and primary director of Euphoria, as well as Abel Tesfaye, better known by his stage name The Weeknd. The Idol stars Tesfaye as a Los Angeles club owner and modern-day cult leader as he embarks upon a “complicated relationship” with a rising pop idol played by Lily-Rose Depp.
As you’d expect from a show that shares its creator with Euphoria, The Idol’s trailer is a debauched affair that promises the series will tell “the sleaziest love story in all of Hollywood.” Levinson is directing each of the show’s six episodes after director Amy Seimetz stepped away from the project in April, Deadline reported at the time.

Because of the size of the components, the latter technique produces more three-dimensional forms that tend to be fastened with dabs of glue.
British artist T.A.G. Smith employs this assemblage method when sculpting his small bird busts, portraits, and single feathers encased in boxes. Each piece begins with a digital rendering, followed by Smith carving shapes from myriad types of wood, allowing the color and grain of the materials to determine its placement in the final form.

在之前的文章和视频中我们拆分了不同的场景对比反射的性能。
文字版： 侧重于细节上的知识点更多、更加详细，揭秘反射真的很耗时吗，射 10 万次耗时多久
视频版： 通过动画展示讲解，更加的清楚、直观，视频版本 bilibili 地址: b23.tv/Hprua24
在之前的文章中提到了一个提升性能非常重要的点，将 Accessible 设置 true 反射速度会进一步提升，如果单看一个程序，可能这点性能微不足道，但是如果放在一个大的复杂的工程下面，运行在大量的低端机下，一行代码提升的性能，可能比你写 100 行代码提升的性能更加显著。
而今天这篇文章从源码的角度分析一下 isAccessible() 方法的作用，为什么将 Accessible 设置为 true 可以提升性能，在开始分析之前，我们先写一段代码。
声明一个普通类，里面有个 public 方法 getName() 和 private 方法 getAddress()
class Person {
    public fun getName(): String {
        return &quot;I am DHL&quot;
    }
    
    private fun getAddress(): String {
        return &quot;BJ&quot;
    }
}

通过反射获取  getName() 和 getAddress() 方法，花 3 秒钟思考一下，下面的代码输出的结果
// public 方法

前言
Comopse 与 React、Flutter、SwiftUI 同属声明式 UI 框架，有着相同的设计理念和相似的实现原理，但是 Compose 的 API 设计要更加简洁。本文就这几个框架在代码上做一个对比，感受一下 Compose 超高的代码效率。
1.Stateless 组件
声明式 UI 的基本特点是基于可复用的组件来构建视图，声明式 UI 的开发过程本质上就是各种 UI 组件的定义过程。组件在类型上一般分为无状态的 Stateless 组件和有状态的 Stateful 组件。
React 提供了类组件，函数式组件两种组件定义方式:
//JS
function Greeting(props) {
  return 
Hello, {props.name}
;
}

//JS
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return 
Hello, {this.props.name}
;
  }
}

函数组件的数据通过 JS 函数参数传递；类组件通过 JSX 的标签属性设置，并通过 Class 的 this.props 读取。注意 props 不同于 state, 它是只读的不可变化，这也是 Stateless 和 Stateful 的本质区别。在代码上函数式组件更加简洁，避免了类定义带来的模板代码，因此，函数式组件在 React 中的使用占比越来越高。
类组件和函数组件也将声明式 UI 框架划分为两个流派，Flutter 和 SwiftUI 属于前者，而 Compose 属于后者。这也从基础上决定了 Compose 的组件的定义将更加简洁。

日益新增的机型，给开发人员带来了很多的适配工作。代码能不能统一、apk能不能统一、物料如何选取、样式怎么展示等等都是困扰开发人员的问题，本方案就是介绍不同机型的共线方案，打消开发人员的疑虑。
一、日益纷繁的机型带来的挑战
1.1 背景
科技是进步的，人们对美的要求也是逐渐提升的，所以才有了现在市面上形形色色的机型
（1）比如vivo X60手机采用纤薄曲面屏设计，属于直板机型。

（2）比如vivo 折叠屏高端手机，提供更优质的视觉体验，属于折叠屏机型。

（3）比如vivo pad，拥有优秀的操作手感和高级的质感，属于平板机型。

1.2 我们的挑战
在此之前，我们主要是为直板手机去服务，我们的开发只要适配这种主流的直板机器，我们的UI主要去设计这种直板手机的效果图，我们的产品和运营主要为这种直板机型去选择物料。

可是随着这种形形色色机型的出现，那么问题就来了：
（1）开发人员的适配成本高了，是不是针对每一种机型，都要做个单独的应用进行适配呢？
（2）UI设计师要做的效果图要多了，是不是要针对每种机型都要设计一套效果图呢？
（3）产品和运营需要选择的物料更受限制了，会不会这个物料在一个机器上正常。在其他机器上就不正常了呢？
为什么这么说，下面以开发者的角度来做介绍，把我们面临的问题，做说明。
二、 开发者的窘境
2.1 全机型适配成本太高
日渐丰富的机型适配让我们这些android开发人员疲于奔命，虽然可以按照要求进行适配，但是大屏幕的机型适配成本依然比较高，因为这些机型不同于传统的直板手机的宽高比例（9:16）。所以有的应用干脆就直接两边留白，内容区域展示在屏幕正中央，这种效果，当然很差。
案例1：某个视频APP页面，未做pad上的适配，打开之后的效果如下，两边大量留白，是不可操作的区域。

案例2：某新闻资讯类APP，在p…</span>

背景
看完本章，你将会学习到用ASM的tree api进行对匿名线程的hook操作，同时也能够了解到asm相关的操作和背景知识介绍！对于ASM插桩来说，可能很多人都不陌生了，但是大多数可能都停留在core api上，对于现在市面上的一些插桩库，其实很多都用tree api进行编写了，因为tree api的简单与明了的特性，也越来越成为许多开源库的选择。（ASM有两套api类型，分别是core 和 tree）

ASM介绍
ASM其实就是一个可以编译字节码的工具，比如说我们日常开发会引入很多的类库对不对，又或者说我们的项目太大了，想修改某个点的时候，统一修改容易出错（比如隐私合规问题等），这个时候如果能有一个工具对生成后的class文件进行编辑的话，就非常方便我们进行后续的工作了。
本章主要介绍tree api，下文所说的ASM都是指tree api的操作哦，对于core api的介绍可以查看笔者曾经写过的文章Spider。
class文件
我们常说的class文件，其实从二进制的角度出发，无非是分成以下几个部分：

可以看到，一个class文件其实就是由上图中的多个部分组成，而ASM，就是把这些结构进行了更进一步的抽象，对于class文件，其实就是抽象成asm中的class node类

对于一个class文件来说，通过以下就可以进行唯一性识别，分别是：version（版本），access（作用域，比如private等修饰符），name（名称），signature（泛型签名），superName（父类），interfaces（实现的接口），fields（当前的属性），methoss（当前的方法）。
所以如果想要修改一个class，我们修改对应的classNode即可
fields

                              <span>前言
  App优化，是一个工作、面试或KPI都绕不开的话题，如何让用户使用流畅呢？今天谨以此篇文章总结一下过去两个月我在工作中的优化事项到底有那些，优化方面还算小白，有不对的地方还望指出海涵, 该文章主要通过讲述Native跳转到Flutter界面秒开率提升。
问题分析
  当你拿到反馈App页面渲染时间长的工单的时候，第一步想到的不应该是有那些那些方法可以降低耗时，我们应该根据自己的真实业务触发，第一步 验证 通过打点或者工具去验证这个问题，了解 一个页面打开耗时的统计方式，分析一个打开耗时是由那些方面组成，通过那些技术手段去解决80%的问题，抓大放小去处理问题。
  通过工具分析启动链路耗时，发现部分必要接口RT时间较长，Flutter引擎冷启耗时较长和View渲染耗时为主要耗时项。接下来就围绕着三个大方面去做一些优化。
网络优化
   以Android 界面跳转链路来说 ，具体链路看下图（模拟数据 主要明白思想）

   看到串行，就知道这里肯定可以有文章做

  可以看到在网络请求可以提前到 Router环节去解析并进行预加载，并行的话可以优化 必要接口RT的时长，节省的时间在页面秒开链路中占比最多。
  在这里需要兼容网络返回较慢的情况，我们可以引入骨架图，提升上屏率。
数据预请求
Router和请求
  通过拦截路由地址，判断路径是否属于预请求白名单。如果匹配，进入预请求逻辑，发起网络拼接和请求，在获取到结果进行本地缓存，供消费界面去消费。因为考虑到网络返回如果慢与界面，可以提供回调，消费界面进来进行绑定。
端侧通讯
   由于Native 跳转到 Flutter ，所以这里需要借助 Channel来进行管道传递，这里我们没有使用MethodChannel 而是选择 可以Native主动通知Flutter 的EventChannel来接收消息。

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · Android-NoteBook 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 跟我一起成长。
前言
LiveData 是 Jetpack 组件中较常用的组件之一，曾经也是实现 MVVM 模式的标准组件之一，不过目前 Google 更多推荐使用 Kotlin Flow 来代替 LiveData；
虽然 LiveData 不再是 Google 主推的组件，但考虑到 LiveData 依然存在于大量存量代码中，以及 LiveData 伴随着 Android 生态发展过程中衍生的问题和解决方案，我认为 LiveData 依然有存在的意义。虽然我们不再优先使用 LiveData，但不代表学习 LiveData 没有价值。
这篇文章是 Jetpack 系列文章第 2 篇，专栏文章列表：

《上学记》何兆武口述 / 文靖执笔
何兆武先生生于 1921 年，1939 年考入西南联大，先后就读于土木、历史、哲学和外文四系。《上学记》主要记录了何先生在西南联大的学习生活回忆。
这本书有三处非常吸引我：
一是全文朴实无华的行文风格。也许因为是口述整理的缘故，全文并未有精巧的章法结构，读下来确实是与人交谈之感，描写亲切又不失准确。
二是令人不禁拍手称妙的金句。书中有些句子，也许是因为行文风格的缘故，感觉「平平无奇」，但就是让人觉得妙，这些句子像是武林高手的点穴，看似轻轻巧巧，却让人动弹不得。
比如谈到图书馆，何先生说年轻时，「每个周末，我都会骑着自行车去北平图书馆借书，一借就是五本，这就是一星期的精神食粮，下周再去。」谈到现在的图书馆，他说，「图书馆的作用是什么？应该是尽最大的可能把书让大家看到。可是按照我们现在的观点，图书是国家的财富，我们要尽量地把它保护好，越翻越烂怎么成？」
再比如现在常被提起的「卷」，何先生也有一段精彩的评述：

包括现在也是这样，我们总有一种落后的农民意识，老想着拼命，强调「吃大苦，耐大劳」，可是进步不能光靠这个，不然整个人类文化能进步多少？前些年我们还提过「超英赶美」，为什么要超它？不就是它比你先进。可它为什么先进？难道英国人、美国人晚上都不睡觉？「满面流汗，终生荆棘」，这是《圣经》里的话，「面朝黄土，背朝天」，中国人干了五千年，可英国历史才一千年，美国连五百年都没有，哥伦布发现新大陆才五百年，它们为什么先进？我们中国人口是英国人口的二十倍，英国才六千万人，我们十三亿人，要论起早贪黑开夜车的话，我们不知道应该比它高明多少，可是近代的伟大开创者，像牛顿、达尔文，包括马克思，都是出自英国，而不是在中国。为什么？是我们中国人懒惰？不能那么说。李政道二十九…</span>

                              <span>无法出游的时候，就喜欢翻看以前出游的照片。去年这个时候，刚好在长沙逛小吃。
由于国金中心那一带受推荐的小吃特别多，所以就在地图上标记了地点，好一路跟着导航吃过去。

后来有好友问我要攻略，我想把收藏的地点发过去，但发现只能一个个点击分享，着实不便。那时就在想，如果自己收藏的地点能统一管理和分享就好了。
所以近期发现了《Exping》这个地图标记应用时，欣喜之情不言而喻。

人们可以在Exping上标记地点、生成地图进行分享。也可以看到其他人公开分享的各种主题地图，比如咖啡地图、徒步地图、美食地图等，对于受疫情影响只能在本地探索的人来说，简直是绝佳的探店指南。
不过后续我也发现，类似的应用并不少，百度地图和高德地图也有类似的定制地图功能，体验上各有千秋，所以这里我也放一起比较，希望能帮到跟我一样喜欢探店打卡的友友～
我对这类应用的主要诉求有这3个：
1、能准确搜到地点并标记
2、能准确导航到该地点
3、分享给朋友后，朋友能在自己的地图软件打卡并收藏
所以下面也会按照这3个标准来分析应用，事不宜迟，马上开始～
Exping：用户热爱分享，有很多主题地图可以去探索
标记地点
尝试了几个地点都能准确搜索到。
缺点是地图信息比较少，如下所示，同样是定位到广州北京路，明显左图高德地图的信息比右图的exping丰富多了。

据创始人所说，exping接入的不是国内的地图，所以丰富程度的确不够。
创始人在评论区留言
优点是标记地点时，除了文本描述外，还可以添加图片、标签、评分，从多个维度点评该地点。这也有助于用户从多个方面来了解该店。

导航地点
exping当前没有导航功能，当点击导航时，exping会引导用户打开其他地图进行导航。
说实话这样体验很差，既然还要打开地图应用导航，那我何不直接用那个应用收藏地点好了？

我是Jeff/花生酱，一名产品经理，兼职内容创作者，主要输出文字。
过去五年，我一直在探索：能否有一天靠全职写作来养活自己。
这其实是个朴素的命题，我猜，几乎所有写作者都设想过类似的可能性。
但写作之自由，让走向最终目标的路径千变万化，难以捉摸。
恰逢“小报童”等付费产品陆续问世，为写作商业化提供了新的可能性。
我想，是个契机完整聊聊我现阶段的看法了。
为什么要试着靠写作养活自己？
为什么要试着靠写作养活自己？
我想从更本质的角度给出现阶段的答案---即，先定义“养活自己”。
所以，先谈谈“财富”与“养活自己”的标准。
人天生对两件事抱有执念，一件是“自由”，另一件是“正确”。
对“自由”和“正确”的执念驱动人成长，但也形成压力。尤其是在这两件事的压力叠加时，会变得更可怕。
我和很多人一样，以“财富自由”为目标去奋斗，但又不知道财富多到什么程度为“自由”，以及，“自由”的自己该过何种生活。再加上对“正确”的执念，喜欢用学生思维去读书和求教，但最终发现答案99%取决于自身，且伴随着自身成长，答案也逐步演变、捉摸不透。两份执念叠加之下，一边对不自由的生活感到焦虑，一边因未找到被认证的“正确”解法感到不安，最终，算是个有意进取的人，却反倒不幸福。
进取的人反倒不幸福？过去两年，我一直试图寻找这个命题/悖论的解法。
焦虑和不安只因不够具体，吸引着我们的“自由”和“正确”，或许只是两个不存在的模糊幻象。所以我考虑用剪枝的策略，把不够具体和确定的条件砍掉，看看这两件事背后的真实命题。
要将这两个幻象具体化，要明确两个具体概念：第一，何为财富，进一步，何为你此生觉得足够的财富。第二，何为自由，以及，你想将自由的时间投向何处。不明确这两个问题的答案，财富的目标将无限膨胀，自由的时间将被浪费，财富自由就是一个不可落地的幻想。

对于财富的目标，我没有划定一个具体的数字。
原因是，我不确…</span>

搜索引擎的基本原理
（注意：这里所说搜索引擎是指狭义上的搜索工具，例如谷歌、百度、微软必应等，并非广义搜索引擎，如专门搜索特定类型文件的搜索引擎，或是各大应用内部检索内容帖子的搜索功能，仅对狭义搜索引擎的基本原理进行叙述。）
先看定义，搜索引擎是指根据一定的策略，运用特定的计算机程序搜集互联网上的信息，并对所搜集到的信息进行组织和处理，为用户提供检索服务的系统。从定义上来看，搜索引擎的功能实现主要经历以下三个步骤：
1. 从互联网上获取信息。搜索引擎主要通过特定计算机程序——蜘蛛系统程序（也就是人们通常所说的爬虫）在互联网联通的各大服务器中爬取网页，并沿着各种网页中的所有URL爬到其他网页，不断延伸爬取的「触角」，并把所有爬到的网页收集回来。
2. 对所搜集到的信息进行组织处理并建立索引数据库。由特定分析程序对搜集到的网页进行分析，提取网页上的相关信息（包括URL、网页内容及其关键词、与其他网页的关系等），并根据一定的相关度算法进行计算，得到网页与特定关键词的相关度，并依据相关度进行排序后建立索引数据库。这里的相关度和排序便是你在某个搜索引擎搜索内容时呈现出的答案排列依据，不同搜索引擎依据不同的指标得出的内容顺序也不相同，例如某度前些年被曝出的广告商可出钱购买特定排序，广受网友抨击。因此，所呈现搜索内容的排序也是…</span>

                              <span>不知道从什么时候开始，拆解并装裱废弃的电子产品开始流行起来，甚至一些厂商也下场提供了官方的装裱服务。
我收藏了两部诺基亚Lumia925，可惜其中一部已经不能开机了，尝试过刷机救砖也不行，便想着把它也装裱起来，当一个摆设继续发挥余热。
看了下网上卖的模版有点千篇一律，而且价格也不便宜。看了几家店铺的介绍后，发现其实工序并不复杂，就打算自己试一下。开头先给大家分享一下我的装裱成果：

个人还是比较满意的。相框是A4纸的尺寸，整体还是比较紧凑的，因为觉得太大了有点占地方，缺点就是参数不能写得太多，一些小的零件就放不下了，大家如果想要把全部零件都展示出来的话，相框可以选择大一点的。
所需素材&amp;价格：

宜家相框（39元）
铜版纸（4元）
热熔胶（已有的）
双面胶（已有的）
手机拆机工具（已有的）
旧手机（已有的）

因为一些材料是之前就有的，所以整体花费是40多元，大头都在宜家的相框上了，网上应该能够买到同尺寸更便宜的。下面就分享一下具体的步骤。
第一步：拆手机、零件归类
搜索手机型号+拆机教程，就可以找到详细的拆机步骤。如果没有工具的话，网上很便宜就能买一套（其实老手机最需要的就是撬棒）。
拆解的过程大家可以量力而行，把重要的部件拆下来就行，也不一定非要追求「芯片级」的拆解。
拆解之后可以简单把零件归类、简单摆放一下，简单构思一下背景图纸的布局，看看有没有什么零件是可以舍弃的。

第二步：设计、打印背景图片
有了零件之后，就到了发挥大家创意的地方——设计背景图纸。我是用PS先建立了一个A4尺寸的背景，然后将网上查到的主要参数列了上去，因为A4纸空间有限，只分出了屏幕、背盖、电池、主板、摄像头、卡槽和其他组件几个模块。
为了保证原汁原味，下图左上角的logo是我从当年的广告片里截取出来的；右上角的彩条是我根据当年Lumia经典的配色PS上去的，让整体色彩稍微多一些，要不然就太单调了。我把这个背景图纸传到网盘了（提取码：jvgg），大家看得上的话可以直接拿去用。

设计好之后，如果家里有打印机的话，可以打出来看一下位置摆放是否合理，顺便看下字体的大小是否合适，再进行一些微调。
不推荐直接用A4纸，太薄了撑不住零件。我去打印店咨询了一下更厚的纸张，店家给我推荐了300g的铜版纸，价格也不贵（A4尺寸2张4元）。大家想做的话，带着源文件直接找打印店就行。
第三步：粘贴零件、安装相框
准备好零件和背景图之后，最后一步就比较简单了。用热熔胶枪把零件都粘贴在背景图纸上，电池最好直接用双面胶，不要接触高温的热熔胶。粘好后清理掉热熔胶的「拉丝儿」，等上一段时间粘牢固。

宜家的相框有三层，透明面板、中框、背部盖板，粘好零件的背景图纸放在中框和背部盖板之间就可以，如果松动的话，可以用胶水把背景图纸和背部盖板粘在一起。
以上就是所有的步骤啦，虽然整体的精致程度不如网上的一些模版，但是自己动手把心爱的手机装裱起来，这种感觉还是很不一样的，如果你有废弃的旧手机也可以自己动手试试。

（我拍了一只视频来记录整个过程，大家感兴趣的话也可以去看看）</span>

自由硬件日益稀缺，但自由软件基金会（FSF）仍然在坚持其理念，它的服务器配置都相当古老，因为新一代的硬件都含有非自由的私有固件。FSF 最近表示它更换了最后一台运行非自由 BIOS 的机器。目前它有两个数据中心和逾百个虚拟机。英特尔和 AMD 在 2013 年之后发售的 CPU 都不支持自由 BIOS。这些 CPU 都会在 BIOS 中安装私有固件，如英特尔管理引擎（IME）。这些 CPU 也会拒绝运行未经过 AMD 和英特尔私钥加密签名的固件，而他们只会签名自己的非自由固件。

老王点评：从自由软件和开源软件两个略有分歧的路线开始，现在看起来开源软件越来越广泛，而自由软件面临的局面越来越艰难了。因为，那些“拥抱”开源的企业发现，开源对他们是有利的，而自由软件则不是。




各国程序员平均年薪，美国第一，中国仅相当于美国的 1/5

一家招聘平台统计分析了 20 多个国家的软件开发者在 2022 年的薪资状况，并列出了排名数据。据统计，2022 年年薪最高的三个国家为：美国（11 万美元）、瑞士（9.8 万美元）和以色列（7.2 万美元）。而中国为 2.4 万美元，约折合人民币 16 万，仅相当于美国程序员平均收入的 21.6%。就全球使用的编程语言而言，Golang 和 Python 语言薪酬最高，PHP、JavaScript 语言最低。

                              <span>你好! 我最近又开始运行一些服务器（nginx playground、mess with dns、dns lookup），所以我一直在考虑监控问题。

最初我并不完全清楚如何监控这些网站，所以我想快速写下我是如何做到的。

我根本不打算谈如何监控大型的、严肃的关键任务网站，只谈微型的不重要的网站。

目标：在操作上几乎不花时间

我希望网站大部分时间都能正常工作，但我也希望不用在持续的运营上花费时间。

我最初对运行服务器非常警惕，因为在我的上一份工作中，我是 24/7 轮流值班，负责一些关键的服务，在我的印象中，“负责服务器”意味着“在凌晨 2 点被叫起来修理服务器”和“有很多复杂的仪表盘”。

所以有一段时间我只做静态网站，这样我就不用考虑服务器的问题。

起初，我只是把我的健康检查端点之一变成一…</span>

                              <span>Does your password requires at least the following?
Must be a minimum of 8 characters
Must contain at least 1 number
Must contain at least one uppercase character
Must contain at least one lowercase character
Must contain at least one special character (!@#$%^&amp;*)
Research recently showed this password is cracked in 39 minutes! Yes... you took a risk for brain damage in order to come up with a password like this or let your password manager did the job en still it can be cracked so so fast.
In 2020 this password was cracked in 8 hours. That&#x27;s just 12 times slower then what it is now, imagine how fast it will be within the next 2 years from now.
Best possible way to come up with a password is according to the Diceware-method https://diceware.dmuth.org/
Experts use this to add randomness to the words your password contains. Every 5 numbers you throw in a row belongs to a word. Repeat this process until you have at least 7 words and create a passphrase:

One problem is this won&#x27;t be acceptable by our minimal requirements like we said in the beginning. Of course we can add a number and exclamation mark or whatever, but this isn&#x27;t the best solution.
Also this is pretty harshe to ask everyone to do for &quot;just a password&quot;. This also depends on what the value is of what you are trying to secure. But since people are lazy, lets come up with a solution that works for everyone.
What we can do is higher the least minimal of characters used. If you go from 8 to 12, this means it can be cracked in 3000 years(!) in 2022. Still in 2020 this was 34000 years, so what will it be within the next 2 years? But it is at least takes waaayyyy more time to crack and hopefully a hackers decides to target an easier victim.

Mental illnesses and diseases that cause mental symptoms are somewhat difficult to diagnose due to the uneven nature of such symptoms. One such condition is dementia. While it’s impossible to cure dementia caused by degenerative diseases, early diagnostics help reduce symptom severity with the proper treatment, or slow down illness progression. Moreover, about 23% of dementia causes are believed to be reversible when diagnosed early. 
Communicative and reasoning problems are some of the earliest indicators used to identify patients at risk of developing dementia. Applying AI for audio and speech processing significantly improves diagnostic opportunity f…</span>

Can Abstract class have contructor() ?



Yes abstarct classses can have constructors. Even if you don&#x27;t define JVM will create one default constructor for the abstract class.
What is the need of constructor in abstract class ? 
The main purpose of the constructor is to initialize the newly created object. In abstract class, we have an instance variable, abstract methods, and non-abstract methods. We need to initialize the non-abstract methods and instance variables, therefore abstract classes have a constructor
How costructors will be called in an abstract method as we can&#x27;t create object of abstract class ? 
It&#x27;s called with the help of costructor chaining i.e. when we create the object of sub-class, constructor of abstract class will also be called.

Fast forward a couple of years, my partner and I are now managing the R&amp;D team somewhere (not interesting &amp; not important). Like most teams, we are being swamped with feature requests, and other bullshit the management finds &quot;CRITICAL&quot;.

A user provides a URL to the web browser.
The browser sends a request to the web server, asking for resources related to the URL.
The server receives the request and sends an HTTP response containing the related files to the web browser.
The browser displays the response as web pages to the user.
This type of communication is an HTTP connection, suitable for applications where data doesn&#x27;t change frequently.
Have you ever used a forex trading app or visited a sports betting website? You will notice that the data changes almost every minute; these changes are possible with the help of WebSockets.

But today, we&#x27;ll have a look at you. Yes, you. Specifically, your beautiful faces. We&#x27;ll make you wear hats. We&#x27;ll use face-api.js and the Media Stream API for that.
Don&#x27;t worry, though. Nothing will be processed in the cloud or anywhere outside your machine, you&#x27;ll keep your images, and everything happens in your browser.
Let&#x27;s get started!
First, we&#x27;ll need some HTML: A  element, a hat, two buttons for starting and stopping the video, and two  for selecting a hat and the device. You know, you might have two webcams.

public record Person(string Name, int Id);

Records are the third way of defining data types in C#; the other two are class and struct.
Since they&#x27;re a quite new idea in .NET, we should spend some time experimenting with it and trying to understand its possibilities and functionalities.
In this article, we will see 8 properties of Records that you should know before using it, to get the best out of this new data type.
By default, Records are immutable. This means that, once you&#x27;ve created one instance, you cannot modify any of its fields:
var me &#x3D; new Person(&quot;Davide&quot;, 1);
me.Name &#x3D; &quot;AnotherMe&quot;; // won&#x27;t compile!

So as of today, you can pip install kern-refinery on your machines to download and run our application.

Now that we&#x27;ve finished our open-source go-live, we are looking forward to working towards those three goals every day.
Our work towards the release was mainly put into - again - three areas:
New UI and improved UX

Also, we integrated some features that make it easier to play around with the data from a programmatic point of view, such as the record IDE:

You can check out those things in our guide.
What do you think of the new UI look? Let us know, we&#x27;re excited about your feedback!

                              <span>Modern websites consist multiple features which makes it more attractive and phenomenal. Developers add more customizations and animations to websites for better look and waves are one of them. Every modern website includes waves and its actually convert normal look to better UI.
Creative waves are easy but the actual challenge is to use it, how to setup and where. We can develop waves using pure SVG codes but a lot of different tools which helps you to get attractive waves.

  
Waves tutorial!
    
Hello, amazing readers!
Waves are awesome!

  

  







We can customize waves using SVG path you can explore more about SVG&#x27;s from here!
There are multiple tools area available to draw waves and one of them which I recommend is getwaves.io because its simple to use and its came with lot of customizations like color, size multiple waves and other features. 




You can create various type of animations with HTML SVG&#x27;s with your own creativity visit to official documentation and explore it.

                              <span>Now that we had a look at finding the min/max from an array of arrays, let&#x27;s see how we can go a step further and sort all the items based on a sub-array value.
To sketch the problem, let&#x27;s say we have the following array of users.
const users &#x3D; [
  [&#x27;Nicole&#x27;, 31],
  [&#x27;Chris&#x27;, 33],
  [&#x27;Sanne&#x27;, 1],
  [&#x27;Yaatree&#x27;, 2],
];

The users&#x27; array contains sub-arrays representing a user&#x27;s first name and age.
We can actually use the native sort method to achieve our goal of sorting this array.
In its most basic form, you can call if on an array, and it will try to sort them based on the contents.
It would look like this:
console.log([&#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;].sort());

// [ &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27; ]

However, it&#x27;s a bit more complicated in our case as we have an array of arrays.
console.log(users.sort());

// Returns:
// [
//  [ &#x27;Chris&#x27;, 33 ],
//  [ &#x27;Nicole&#x27;, 31 ],
//  [ &#x27;Sanne&#x27;, 1 ],
//  [ &#x27;Yaatree&#x27;, 2 ]
// ]

This is great if we want to sort on the first name, but we want to sort on the age value.
This is where the extra powers of the sort method come in.
users.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // Do something with a and b
});

The above example code is the syntax we can use.
Since we are sorting on numbers, they even give us a quick option to sort them.
users.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return a[1] - b[1];
});

// Returns:
// [
//  [ &#x27;Sanne&#x27;, 1 ],
//  [ &#x27;Yaatree&#x27;, 2 ],
//  [ &#x27;Nicole&#x27;, 31 ],
//  [ &#x27;Chris&#x27;, 33 ]
// ]

We can also change the order by switching the a and b comparison around.
users.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return b[1] - a[1];
});

// Returns:
// [
//  [ &#x27;Chris&#x27;, 33 ],
//  [ &#x27;Nicole&#x27;, 31 ],
//  [ &#x27;Yaatree&#x27;, 2 ],
//  [ &#x27;Sanne&#x27;, 1 ]
// ]

And to top it off, we can write this as sort hand functions to make it super clean.
users.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; a[1] - b[1]));

And that&#x27;s it. We learned how to sort an array based on a sub-array value.

查遍了京东的文档还是没有发现 openjd://virtual?params&#x3D;参数的说明
如果有链接转换 deeplink 的工具就更好了

最近半年，公司所有人电脑手机都有这个问题
具体表现为，网络一切正常，上网各方面都好好的，突然你打开一个网页，然后就转圈圈，最后无法访问此网站
但是你刷新一下，他就又出来了
一开始的时候，这个现象集中在早上发生，后来早上下午都会，最近是整天都会这样
关键是，他不是那种完全不能上网，上网都很流畅，就是突然你就打不开网页，就很难受
公司有两条宽带进入，一条是联通专线（机房服务器用），一条是电信普通家宽（大家办公电脑用）
专线的 IP 段为 192.168.1.1-100 ，当我手动把 IP 改为专线这个网段，就不会有问题
DHCP 是 192.168.1.101-254 这个网段，也就是普通宽带，只有在这个网段才会发生这个问题
之前怀疑是光猫太老了，但是今天刚新装了一条 1000M 的家宽，换了光猫，也是没能解决这个问题</span>

手机能收到 iwatch 充电完成提示

当前情况是这样的，我 2019 年在 PDD 买了机器，并且上了 AC+ 现在电池出现系能问题，需要换个电池
当初商家开了发票，但是是分两张开的，问了售后，说不支持两张，也问了 400 客服，也说不支持
最后问了税务局，税务局说 商家这样开是没有违法的，因为有些商家是限额 1 万额度，超过 1 万只能分开开，合乎法规
要商家补开也没法了，他们就是只能开 1 万以下的
现在挺尴尬的点就是 售后的系统只能录入一张发票，他们也不确定只发第一张过去，厂商认不认。
有没有大兄弟遇到过这样的问题啊，看下后来怎么处理的
我在想直接跨市去直营店会不会能解决这个问题

根据廖雪峰教学文章中提供的代码，
https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/1252599548343744/1298069163343905
我在使用 FileInputStrem 打开和关闭文件时都必须添加 trycatch
InputStream input &#x3D; new FileInputStream(&quot;src/readme.txt&quot;);
input.close()

否则编译器就会提示 java: 未报告的异常错误 java.io.FileNotFoundException; 必须对其进行捕获或声明以便抛出。这导致一个读取文件的逻辑要三次 trycatch ，非常不优雅。
根据其后文的描述可以采用
try (InputStream input &#x3D; new FileInputStream(&quot;src/readme.txt&quot;)) {
}

的方式让编译器自动补全 finally 后的 close ，但是我尝试其代码编译器仍提示必须捕捉 Exception 。
请问这是由于 jdk 版本不同引发的从错误吗？ javaer 正常打开和关闭文件的姿势是什么样的</span>

最近感觉到通过远程录制的播客节目越来越多了，当前比较广泛采用的录制方式大致有两种，一种是通过会议软件自带的录制功能，但这种方式存在两个问题
所有参与人的音轨被合并成一条音轨，导致剪辑的时候没有什么操作空间了
录制的音频内容是被压缩过的，作为会议记录用没问题，但作为音频内容质量是不太过关的
另一种称之为&quot;multiEnder&quot;，也就是参与人还通过会议软件沟通，但与此同时，会使用另一个设备在本地录制音轨，录制过程结束后各自将自己的音轨发给主持人，由主持人完成剪辑。这种方式虽然解决了以上两个大的问题，但在具体实施的过程中，也会存在其他的小问题，此处就不展开了。
此外，以下问题也是不可忽略的：
文件丢失。听到好多期节目讲到在录制过程中由于录制设备或者存储卡等问题导致已经录制的内容丢失的事故
重复无聊的准备工作。节目录制前，主持人要对每个嘉宾重复同样的话术、注意事项等等
我觉得这些问题是可以通过工具被解决的，事实上，国外也的确有这样的工具了，所以我开发了一个工具 mono ，旨在解决以上的问题，原理也很简单粗暴，就是在语音聊天的同时，将各位参与人的本地录制的音频内容上传到云存储空间，目前实现了以下功能：
打开浏览器（推荐新版本的 Chrome 、Edge ）即可使用
音频文件分轨，每位参与人都有其独立的音轨，留给后期剪辑充分的操作空间
音频质量达到了 48kHz 、16bit 深度，768kbps 的水准
音频文件边录制边同步至云存储
结束录制后可将音频文件下载到本地
更多更具体的介绍可以点击这里查看：
下面是一些使用截图：

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
xxxtool upload /path/to/file
your file number is:  123456
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
然后在服务器执行
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
xxxtool download 123456
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

两个机器都不是服务器（没有固定 IP ）也是可以的，用过一次觉得极好，名字居然搞忘记了。

住在周边绿化比较好的一楼，家里平均每天出现两三只新蚊子，严重影响睡眠质量
抛开驱蚊问题本身，目前最想搞清楚的是它们怎么进屋的
已进行过的排查如下：
进入户门前会特别注意周围有没有蚊子，有的话打死 /赶走再进
窗户为断桥铝内开+20 目标准纱窗，经检查没有发现破损，漏水口也都贴了纱窗贴片
抽油烟机 /燃气热水器烟道通户外，有止逆阀
卫生间浴霸一体机通公共风道，有止逆阀
目前后两者嫌疑最大，怀疑是止逆阀未完全闭合导致飞进来的，但没有验证方法
有没有能提供点其他思路或建议的，先谢过</span>

遇到一个很神奇的问题，打开 Telegram 前台概率触发之后冷启动的 APP 无网络 (此时 Telegram 本身也是显示 Connecting 的)。在 Telegram 前台打开之前的 APP 可继续正常联网。未启动过的 APP 想要联网就只能重启系统。
重启后在不打开 Telegram 的情况下一切正常。但只要打开一次，这之后的 APP 又继续无网络。
目前唯一尝试到的解决方案是清空 Telegram 的数据。可如果在清空数据之前使用工具备份好，先清空 Telegram 数据，手动打开一次 Telegram ，然后再用工具恢复数据，又没有问题了。然后过一段挺长的时间，在不知道什么时候，又会再次出现。
这个问题出现的概率不大，但是一旦出现就要清 Telegram 数据并重启，再恢复数据，就很纳闷。</span>

还记得 6 年前的夏天，我在巨硬写着世界上最好的语言，有时也需要带着游标卡尺写着另一门语言。然而，我对这两门语言都不熟悉，如果能在 VS Code 中方便快捷地运行各种语言，那岂不是很方便？于是，我就开发了 Code Runner 插件:
https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner
下载量
2016 年 7 月 15 日，Code Runner 正式发布！
2019 年 11 月 24 日，Code Runner 下载量突破 1000 万！
2021 年 1 月 31 日，Code Runner 下载量突破 2000 万！
2021 年 11 月 7 日，Code Runner 下载量突破 3000 万！
2022 年 7 月 17 日，Code Runner 下载量突破 4000 万！

多语言支持
经过数年时间的打磨，Code Runner 的功能越来越丰富，也支持了超过 50 种语言：
C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Perl, Perl 6, Ruby, Go, Lua, Groovy, PowerShell, BAT/CMD, BASH/SH, F# Script, F# (.NET Core), C# Script, C# (.NET Core), VBScript, TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Scala, Swift, Julia, Crystal, OCaml Script, R, AppleScript, Elixir, Visual Basic .NET, Clojure, Haxe, Objective-C, Rust, Racket, Scheme, AutoHotkey, AutoIt, Kotlin, Dart, Free Pascal, Haskell, Nim, D, Lisp, Kit, V, SCSS, Sass, CUDA, Less, Fortran, Ring, Standard ML, Zig 。
新方向
不仅仅是功能上的改进和支持的编程语言的数量上的增加，我还一直尝试探索新的方向。
去年 12 月，我发布了全新的 Code Runner for Web 插件！
https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner-for-web

与 Code Runner 需要用户自行安装相应的编译器 /解释器不同，安装好 Code Runner for Web 插件后，我们可以在 vscode.dev 、github.dev 和桌面版 VS Code 中直接运行 Python ！它有两大亮点：
快速便捷：不需要额外安装 Python 解释器，真正的一键运行！
免费：无需后端运行环境，全部在浏览器环境中完成！
巧合
2021 年 12 月，我发布了 Code Runner for Web 。
2022 年 4 月，Anaconda 发布了 PyScript！
站在巨人的肩膀上
Code Runner for Web 的工作原理是怎么样的呢？
有下面三位重要的巨人：
WebAssembly/WASM ( https://webassembly.org/)
Emscripten ( https://emscripten.org/): 把基于 LLVM 的项目编译到浏览器、Node.js 或者 WebAssembly 运行时。
Pyodide ( https://pyodide.org/en/stable/): 基于 WebAssembly 的 Python 发行版。
简单来说，就是通过 Emscripten ，Pyodide 把 CPython 解释器预先编译成 WebAssembly ，使得 Python 文件可以在浏览器中运行！

未来
WebAssembly is the future!
让我们一起期待！

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a centralized and automated method for configuring the network attributes of hosts when they connect to the network. The DHCP server assigns IP addresses to hosts, along with configuration information such as DNS servers, the domain name used for DNS searches, the default gateway, an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server, a server from which a network boot can be performed if necessary, and more. DHCP eliminates the need to configure each network host individually.
DHCP is also useful for configuring laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and other devices which might connect as unknown guests. This …</span>

Hyundai’s attempting to keep car culture alive with its two performance-focused electric vehicle (EV) concepts it calls “rolling labs.” The RN22e features a modified Ioniq 6 body, and the N Vision 74 is modeled after the never-released 1974 Pony Coupe concept — but both feature a refreshing sporty design that doesn’t look like some sort of futuristic pod (or, well... this thing).
The two concepts come from Hyundai’s “N” sub-brand, which focuses on high-performance vehicles. The N Vision 74 is the most striking of the two, and features a design that draws elements from the 2025 Hyundai N Vision Gran Turismo and the 1974 Pony Coupe concept that was originally designed by the iconic Giorgetto Giugiaro — the same man who went on to make the...

Fans of buttons can count on Captain America for support, as Chris Evans notes that even after a few weeks with a newer phone, he still prefers his old iPhone 6S and its button. The topic came up in an interview with Collider (via iMore) while doing a press tour for Netflix’s $200 million+, Russo brothers-directed spy flick The Gray Man, which he stars in along with Ryan Gosling.
Evans is far from the only person still stuck on the missing button (he and Donald Trump agree on at least one thing), which Apple swapped for a solid circle with taptic engine feedback on the iPhone 7, and eventually dropped entirely from the iPhone X onward. Evans’ other big complaint is that it’s just too heavy. Like many people who struggle with bulkier...

Tesla’s apparently looking to expand its collection of in-car games... by adding Steam. In a reply to a tweet, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company’s “making progress with Steam integration” and that we can expect a demo “probably next month.”
Tesla already offers a number of games through the built-in Tesla Arcade, like Cuphead and Sonic the Hedgehog 1, but adding Steam’s digital storefront could give users access to a whole lot more. We still don’t know if the integration will go so far as to allow users to make purchases on Steam while sitting in their cars, or if there will be any games Teslas can’t support.
We’re making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month.

Last week, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote a letter urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to address deceptive practices in the Virtual Private Network (VPN) industry. Eshoo and Wyden’s letter comes as people look to hide their digital footprint following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
A VPN allows a user to establish an encrypted connection between their device and a private server, making it harder for third parties to access their online activity. With abortion becoming illegal or restricted in several states, more people are looking to conceal their messages and search history, as police can use this information to prosecute someone seeking the procedure.
In their letter,...

引子
App 开发中，等待多个异步结果的场景很多见，
比如并发地在后台执行若干个运算，待所有运算执行完毕后归总结果。
比如并发地请求若干个接口，待所有结果返回后刷新界面。
比如统计相册页并发加载 20 张图片的耗时。
其实把若干异步任务串行化是最简单的解决办法，即前一个异步任务执行完毕后再执行下一个。但这样就无法利用多核性能，执行时间被拉长，此时的执行总时长 &#x3D; 所有任务执行时长的和。
若允许任务并发，则执行总时长 &#x3D; 执行时间最长任务的耗时。时间性能得以优化，但随之而来的一个复杂度是：“如何等待多个异步结果”。
本文会介绍几种解决方案，并将它们运用到不同的业务场景，比对一下哪个方案适用于哪个场景。

// 拉取新闻

    newsApi.fetchNews().enqueue(object : Callback&gt; {
        override fun onFailure(call: Call&gt;, t: Throwable) { ... }
        override fun onResponse(call: Call&gt;, response: Response&gt;) { ... }
    })
}

背景
上期《Google Android 架构设计拆解及改善建议》侧重拆解官方架构 “领域层” 设计误区，并给出改善建议 —— 通过 MVI-Dispatcher 承担 Event-Handler，
然有小伙伴表示，不仅要 MVI-Dispatcher，还想看看 Kotlin 版 MVI 实践

故这期，我们肝个 MVI-Dispatcher-KTX 示例项目而来。
项目简介
“单向数据流” 是近年公认 “图形化客户端开发” 领域最佳实践，
MVI-Dispatcher 抹除 “单向数据流” 学习成本，使开发者在不熟 mutable、MVI 情况下，仅根据简明易懂 input-output 设计亦可自动实现 “单向数据流” 开发，
KTX 版接口与 MVI-Dispatcher 保持一致，可彻底消除 mutable 样板代码；杜绝 setValue/emit 误用滥用；且可无缝整至 Jetpack MVVM 项目中。
implementation &#x27;com.kunminx.arch:mvi-dispatch-ktx:6.0.0-beta&#x27;


以下排坑测试花絮：
SharedFlow 也 “丢” 事件？
同 MVI-Dispatcher，KTX 版在 sample module 提供一系列常规 + 暴力测试，
我们于 ComplexRequester 安排 4 组事件选项，事件 1 可轮询通知事件 4 回推 UI，事件 2 延迟 200 毫秒后可回推 UI，事件 3 可直接回推 UI，

开源代码几乎在地球上的每一台计算机上运行，当今世界重度依赖于 Linux 内核。这也意味着任何人都能够参与到代码的编写、阅读和使用过程中，这点让美国军方内部的网络安全专家感到十分担心。“关键的开源软件以我们仍然几乎不了解的方式，暴露于恶意的操纵之下。”美国国防部高级研究计划局（DARPA）设立了一个计划长达 18 个月、耗资数百万美元的 SocialCyber 项目。最终目标是检测并抵御任何恶意活动、提交有缺陷的代码、介入干预、阻止开发，甚至接管整个开源项目。为此研究人员将使用情绪分析等工具，来分析开源社区内的社交互动 —— 比如 Linux 内核邮件列表。这将有助于确定谁在积极参与建设，同时谁又在消极怠工或悄悄搞破坏。

IE 团队收到来自 Mozilla 的谢幕祝贺蛋糕

微软的 IE 浏览器已于 6 月正式退役，这对科技行业的几乎所有人来说都是一个快乐的时刻。按照互相送蛋糕的悠久传统，Mozilla 的 Firefox 团队给微软 IE 团队送了最后一个蛋糕，以庆祝历史悠久的 IE 浏览器的落幕。蛋糕上面有一个巨大的 IE 标志。蛋糕上写着：“you were the ie6ing on the cake”。浏览器开发团队互相赠送蛋糕是一个可以追溯到十多年前的传统。微软在 2006 年Firefox 2.0 发布时给 Firefox 团队送了一个蛋糕，并在后来大多数的 Firefox 主要版本发布时都延续了这一传统。尽管随着浏览器发布周期的加快，这些蛋糕最终变成了杯子蛋糕。在 2012 年 IE 10 到来之后，Mozilla 向微软送了一个蛋糕，然后谷歌的 Chrome 团队也开始加入向对手送蛋糕的行列。

谷歌应用商店将由开发者来编写应用的权限描述

谷歌正在关闭独立的“应用权限”部分，新的数据安全部分显示了开发者提供的隐私注意事项清单，比如一个应用程序收集哪些数据，这些数据是如何存储的，以及这些数据与谁共享。开发者可以解释如何以及为什么要收集每一点数据。旧的应用程序权限列表可以保证是真实的，因为它是由谷歌通过扫描应用程序自动建立的。而数据安全系统则是在荣誉系统上运行的。谷歌称，“谷歌应用商店审查所有政策要求的应用；但是，我们不能代表开发者对他们如何处理用户数据做出判断。……当谷歌意识到你的应用行为与你的声明之间存在差异时，我们可能会采取适当的行动，包括执法行动。”

                              <span>在本杂志 2022 年 4 月号中，我们了解了不同类型的 SSL 证书及其应用。本文介绍如何手动更新现有 SSL 证书，以使其保持最新的安全要求。

当访问者与你的网站互动并分享信用卡号码等关键细节时，他们相信他们的信息已得到保护，不会被滥用。因此，你有责任尊重这种信任并为你网站上的所有访问者提供全面保护。不这样做不仅会使你失去客户的忠诚度，而且还可能使你陷入法律困境。在许多情况下，无法保护客户数据免遭泄露、盗窃或滥用的网站被迫支付巨额罚款，同时也失去了声誉。

SSL 证书如何保护客户的数据？

保护敏感客户信息的最佳方法之一是使用 SSL（安全套接字层）证书保护你的站点。用不涉及技术细节的话来说，SSL 证书对 Web 服务器和访问者浏览器之间的通信进行加密，从而使黑客或威胁参与者在技术上不可能窃取传输中的数据。 SSL 建立了一个安全的握手过程来解密加密的信息，这个过程太复杂了，人类甚至软件都无法破解。（LCTT 校注：此处言过其实，SSL 加密传输的信息并不是绝对不可截获和破解的，比如中间人攻击等。）

为什么需要更新 SSL 证书？

虽然 SSL 证书提供了防止数据盗窃或滥用的安全性，但你需要定期更新它以确保最有效的安全性以抵御最新的威胁。本文将列出以正确方式更新 SSL 证书的分步说明。

更新 SSL 证书有很多好处：


及时更新验证你的网站的身份。

获得更新的安全性。

一年有效期促进定期更新/升级保护范围的健康实践，从而消除与过时版本相关的风险。



注意：最佳做法是选择一种自动续订方式，以减轻你记住续订日期或手动执行相关步骤的压力。

是的，这绝对是真的！通过一些简化和紧凑的步骤，你实际上可以从头开始构建自己的 SSL 证书！虽然整个过程超出了本文的范围，但这…</span>

                              <span>有一个想要为你带来一款诺基亚风格的 Linux 手机的开源项目，但诺基亚似乎并不喜欢这个项目的名字。




近期，一个旨在打造经典诺基亚（小型）的 Linux 手机的开源项目，遭到了诺基亚的抨击。

该项目的名称最初是 “Notkia”，然而，诺基亚认为该名称与自己相似，可能会影响自己的品牌声誉，并侵犯到自己的权利。

虽然这样做可以保护公司的业务，但这些公司向在当前状态下甚至对他们构不成威胁的项目发送侵权通知是怎么回事？

Notkia：开发一款袖珍 Linux 手机

不过还得 感谢 诺基亚的这个侵权通知，我们才能了解到这个有趣的项目：开发一款满足基本使用、注重隐私的小型 Linux 手机。

该项目的目标是设计一个完全适合诺基亚经典手机外壳的 PCB。



到目前为止，该项目已经支持许多硬件相关的功能，包括蓝牙和 Wi-Fi。

该项目不基于安卓，而是基于主线 Linux 内核。

你可以在他们的 官方博文 中，了解有关该项目和计划中的手机规格。

目前，该项目正在等待筹款，以便可以单独购买早期原型机。

灵感来自诺基亚，并受到诺基亚的关注

嗯，该项目清楚地表明他们受到诺基亚经典手机的启发，他们并没有试图误导任何贡献者和潜在客户。

该项目的创建者在推特上分享了诺基亚的电子邮件，同时他提到，诺基亚在将此类通知发送给以社区利益为主导的项目之前，应该更谨慎一些才对。


再次阅读 @Nokia 的邮件后，我开始感到愤怒。这无非是一场精心策划的演出。既然它是一个协作项目，并且得到了世界各地的人们的贡献，因此，我将把完整的电子邮件发布给它的“预期收件人”。




此外，他们确认该项目将更名。

当然，作为一个开源项目，它应该和诺基亚是扯不上关系的，除非他们使用诺基亚的品牌名称销售他们的原型/手机。

但是，在目前的状态下，这更像是一个激情项目，是开源爱好者社区协作努力的成果。因此，向他们发出侵犯诺基亚权利的通知，听起来实在有些牵强。

对吗？

当然，对于一般企业来说，这并不奇怪；但对于诺基亚来说，这未免有点过于谨慎和反竞争了。

更何况，我们可以肯定地说，诺基亚的最新的智能手机的表现，并没有达到用户的预期。

有趣的是，一位推特用户发现，还有一家名为 “Notkia” 的 IT 公司。他们是否也收到了诺基亚的通知？呵呵，谁知道呢。

那么，你如何看待这个基于 Linux 的袖珍手机的开源项目呢？在下面的评论中分享你的看法吧！

Cover generated by MakeItPixel from the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci
A little disclaimer: I have great respect for pixel artists and I know that &quot;pixel art&quot; is not the most proper name for what programs like mine generate. But lacking a better term, and because everyone uses it, I&#x27;ll do it too, being aware that generated generated pixel art has flaws that any artist could point out and correct. 
What would I expect from a pixel art generator?
Re-scaling of an image to a given resolution.
Optional use of fully customizable palettes.
Parameterizable color quantization and dithering.
Background removal.

Every couple of days, a beginner comes to our programming server, The Coding horizon, and asks for help - That&#x27;s perfectly OK! Asking for help is natural and is almost necessary for learning. However, you need to HELP OTHERS to help you.
So here&#x27;s some points to keep in mind, I&#x27;ll try to keep it short and simple. You might like my blog about Learning to code, for beginners if you enjoyed this one.
Let&#x27;s start off with some things that you absolutely should not do.
Many people don&#x27;t know how to frame their questions very well, so they ask others to join a voice call. Please keep in mind that people that are willing to help you have a life, and they might not be in the situation to join a voice call, or even if they are, they might not b…</span>

When you operate a global SaaS product, your synchronous alerting channels can be overwhelmed from time to time. Noise notwithstanding, it becomes a real challenge to retroactively analyze issues across a wide range of components and environments.
Our alert analytics solution needs to meet the following goals:
Analyze alerts across multiple dimensions. During major regional or global outages, it’s challenging to keep up with alerts firing across different systems that are ultimately related to the same issue. When your alerting Slack channel becomes overwhelmed, you need a solution that makes it easy to analyze and correlate these alerts across all your regions and environments. This way, we can easily figure out which customers have been affected by a specific outage.

                              <span>🖐 Hello Guys!
If you want to show the date-time-field of a django model in human familiar term you can use this filter like this:
{{ field_date|timesince }}

and it will return you the time like 2 days ago format
If you want to show the text of a field of a django model as you write in the form (with spaces, and tabs) you could use this filter in template like this:
{{ value|linebreaks }}

If you want to display the first n words of a django model field in the template you can use this filter. For example if you want to show the first two words of the text you can use the filter like this:
{{ text|truncatewords:2 }}

and the output will be like Hello Python ...
If you want to make an url active of the text of a django model field you can use this template filter like this:
{{ text|urlize }}

If you want to show the number of words of a django model field in the template you can use this filter like this:
{{ text|wordcount }}

and it will return the number of the words in the template
If you want to show the text of a django model field in Title Case you can use this template filter like this:
{{ text|title }}

You can use |upper and |lower for respectively UPPER CASE and lower case.

                              <span>There ever been the time where you went deep in to the monitor screen just to concentrate on some code ?
There ever been the time where you minify your eyes because the text you are seeing is not clearly visible ?
I used only dark mode till today as I was struggling coding in my bright environment. I leaned in to the monitor eventhough the brightness was full. 


If you&#x27;re comfortable reading code in light mode in your current environment then thats light mode is for you.
As I always work in a well lit environment the light mode really helps see the code sharply. Just like 📝 paper and ink.
Its not just coding but on other places too! I felt more comfortable seeing in light mode in environment.


These preferences are going to change as the day progress.
So ultimately if you are doing a lot of coding in the low light, dark mode is best. If you are doing in day time I prefer light mode ( atleast for me ). 
I do both.
There never been one preference is better than other. Thats why its called preferences! 
Thanks &amp; Cheers!

                              <span>In the previous article, we looked at finding the min/max from an array of arrays. Let&#x27;s see how we can do the same with an array of objects.
Our array will look like this:
const users &#x3D; [
  { name: &#x27;Nicole&#x27;, age: 31 },
  { name: &#x27;Chris&#x27;, age: 33 },
  { name: &#x27;Yaatree&#x27;, age: 2 },
  { name: &#x27;Sanne&#x27;, age: 29 },
];

With this array, we want to find the highest and the lowest age users.
Let&#x27;s see how we can achieve that.
We&#x27;ll use the reduce method to extract one item from the array. The cool thing about the reduce is that the initial value is optional, so that we can omit it for now.
const highest &#x3D; users.reduce((previous, current) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return current.age &gt; previous.age ? current : previous;
});

console.log(&#x27;highest&#x27;, highest);

                              <span>Clean code isn&#x27;t code that just works. It refers to neatly organized code which is easy to read, simple to understand and a piece of cake to maintain.
Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the best practices for clean code in React, which can take the ease of maintaining your code to the moon! 🚀🌕
Quite often while using TypeScript a lot of people skip out on providing explicit types for values, thus missing out on the true benefit TypeScript has to offer. Often these can be seen in code-base:
Bad Example 01:
const Component &#x3D; ({ children }: any) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // ...
};

Bad Example 02:
const Component &#x3D; ({ children }: object) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // ...
};

Instead using a properly defined interface would make your life so much easier, with the editor providing you accurate suggestions.
Good Example:

情况如下：
一款 AR 方向的 app ，目前只缺少一位 iOS 前端
接触过一些投资人，其中比较年轻的都看好这个项目，希望我与其保持沟通
有注册的公司，人员情况是产品设计交互由我一人包办，有一位后端，有一位全栈作为技术辅助，有一位测试，有一位艺术家
项目分出规划好了几个里程碑，每达成一个，我都会与投资人沟通，以尽早得到资金支持
我们会合理地分配每个成员所占的股权比例（如果来投资的话），前期一些费用都是由我自己出的
我们目前都是兼职在在做这件事，原因是它有趣、有价值、有希望能做成自己的事业，而我们都对自己的现状不满，如果你有搞定我们挑战的能力，有共鸣，欢迎加入。

同时我们还在规划一款目前市面上没有这种玩儿法的手机游戏，我将发到另外一个帖子里。
祝所有人 live long and prosper 。</span>

Vue 新人，Nuxt 更新人，刚接触 Nuxt ，好像不用写路由挺方便的
假设不做 SSR ，用来做单页应用，用 Nuxt 傻不傻；是否还不如直接用 Vue 。
Nuxt2 的坑多不多，Vue3 TS 都不会，所以还停留在 2 。
有没有什么 Nuxt 搭建的开源项目可以做一些参考学习，比如二次封装 axios 之类的。</span>

现在有一个图像处理的需求是需要获取单通道峰值点，

比如上面这张图，如果把整个分布视为一条曲线的话，假设从左到右是 0-255 ，可以看出图中有 2 个（或 3 个）峰，这张图的情况的话理论希望输出 15,240 （大概类似这个数吧，就是各峰的中心点）
请问有什么算法能实现类似效果么？因为数据本身是离散的，本身又有随机性，如果写一个遍历，比如某个点比左高，同时比右高，就判断为中心点，这种是不行的。因为数据没有周期性，fft 似乎也是分析不出来，小波分析我看了些文章没看懂，而且感觉似乎不太适合这种情况。。</span>

If you have a flip phone that you haven’t used in over a decade, or maybe even a broken tablet, Amazon will pay for a shipping label that you can use to send it in to get recycled. Apparently, this recycling program has been a thing for a while now, but several of us at The Verge never even knew about it until we saw this tweet from journalist Dave Zatz, and thought it might be a good idea to spread the word.
Amazon’s recycling program lets you ship your small electronics for free from any UPS dropoff point (you just have to provide the packaging). Amazon then transfers the devices it receives to a licensed recycling facility, and notes that it will remove or destroy any “identifying marks or personal information” during the process....

Intel’s tempering expectations for its upcoming Arc A750 Limited Edition GPU. In a new video that’s just three minutes long, the chipmaker gives us the briefest of glimpses at the card’s pretty average on-paper performance.
Before we dive in, it’s important to note that the A750 is supposed to be one of Intel’s top-of-the-line GPUs, as indicated by the “7” at the front of its name. Intel’s naming conventions have the Arc 5 and Arc 3 sitting below the Arc 7, which are supposed to offer midrange and entry-level performance, respectively.
During the video, Intel’s Ryan Shrout boots up Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with the A750 chip installed, and instead of giving us a long look at gameplay, Shrout skips straight to performance. With the game set...

TikTok’s global chief security officer (CSO), Roland Cloutier, is stepping down as the company transitions to using Oracle’s US-based servers to store Americans’ data (via The Wall Street Journal). The company shared an internal memo about the shift in a post on its newsroom, which states Cloutier will assume an advisory role, with TikTok’s head of security risk, vendor, and client assurance, Kim Albarella, taking over temporarily.
“With our recent announcement about data management changes in the US, it’s time for me to transition from my role as Global Chief Security Officer into a strategic advisory role focusing on the business impact of security and trust programs, working directly with Shou, Dingkun and other senior leaders,”...

Evo, the shorthand name for the prestigious Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament, will be an in-person event again for the first time since 2019. Evo was just one of many events that had to do things differently because of COVID-19, and even though the upcoming Evo will be at a convention center once again, general manager Rick Thiher tells The Verge that things are just different now.
“The market is not the same as it was when we went on hiatus in respect to COVID,” Thiher said. “Having COVID not really fully passed at this time, that hiatus has created new concerns, new needs, and has really restructured expectations both for the workforce and even the endemic tournament organizers that we work with to help put Evo...

It’s been a busy week here at The Verge, with the recent reviews of the new M2 MacBook Air and Nothing Phone 1 as well as non-stop coverage of Amazon Prime Day. I’m sure all of us are ready for a relaxing weekend to rest and recoup. But first, more deals!
This first one is actually perfect for R&amp;R time, as it’s a Bluetooth speaker you can take with you to the beach or poolside for some sunbathing. The JBL Flip 5 is on sale for $84.99 at Woot. This discount of about $45 on the waterproof speaker is the best we’ve seen in quite a while, and lower than anything offered during Prime Day. The Flip 5 comes in a variety of colors and offers good sound, with enough volume to fill a room or really annoy the couple sitting under the umbrella next...

Your Apple ID is your key to using the integrated services of Apple’s ecosystem, including the App Store, iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, and Apple Music. You also need one to set up any new Apple device. As with any password, if you think it may have been compromised, you should change it immediately. It’s also a good idea to change it every few months to help keep it extra secure. 
When you do choose a new password, you’ll need to think of one that’s at least eight characters long and uses at least one number, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter. You also can’t reuse a password from the last year. 
Here are the steps you’ll need to take to change your Apple ID password. Bear in mind that these will only work if you know your...

On Friday, Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to two federal regulators, urging them to take action on the explosion of Bitcoin mining in the US. 
Sent to the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy, the letter was spurred by preliminary investigation from lawmakers, which found that just a handful of cryptominers use an enormous amount of energy. In response, the lawmakers ask the agencies to require that crypto-mining companies share data on their energy use and emissions.
Seven of the biggest crypto-mining companies in the US have the collective capacity to use over 1 gigawatt of electricity, according to the letter. That’s the equivalent of two standard coal plants...

                              <span>一、ANR概述
ANR(Application Not responding)是指应用程序未响应，Android系统对于一些事件需要在一定的时间范围内完成，如果超过预定时间能未能得到有效响应或者响应时间过长，都会造成ANR。
1.1、Anr的触发时机
anr的触发时机有很多种，基本分为以下几点：
输入事件：5s内无响应，如屏幕触碰事件；
广播：执行前台广播（BroadcastReceiver）的onReceive()方法时10s没有处理完成，后台广播的超时时间为60s；
Service：前台Service20s内没有执行完毕；后台Service200s内没有执行完毕；
ContentProvider：10s内ContentProvider的publish未执行完；
从上面4点来看，每一种触发的时机都是在规定的时间内，看你消不消费得完自身的事件，而本文所探讨的问题就是，这些时间是由谁来制定，并且Anr的核心点在哪里。
二、Service的ANR
前台Service20s内没有执行完毕，后台Service200s内没有执行完毕，就会触发ANR。
开启service有两种方式，一个是startService一个是bindService，本文从startService开始分析，我们可以先看看service的启动流程。

简单概括，AMS开启了service服务，传递到ActiveServices，ActiveServices是协助AMS完成启动、绑定等逻辑操作，在ActiveService的realStartServiceLocked方法中创建了service对象，开启了一个service的onCreate()。
service的ANR在于时间的控制，那开始计时的逻辑怎么看？

Kotlin协程-协程的常见进阶使用
Kotlin协程系列：
协程的基本使用
协程的上下文理解
协程的作用域管理
协程的常见进阶使用（本文）
通过之前的文章，我们理解协程的启动方式，切换线程的方式，挂起函数，阻塞与非阻塞的区别。
理解了协程的上下文，调度线程，管理协程的Job,异常管理等。
理解了协程的作用域，父子协程的概念，GlobalScop、MainScope 和 Android 特有的 lifecycleScope viewModelScope 等。了解他们的异同与使用方法。
那么在实际开发中，我们如何使用协程呢？又有哪些注意点呢？比如网络请求如何使用与封装，自定义协程还有哪些用法，协程如何并发与加锁等等。
我们一起往下看。
一、协程中使用网络请求与封装
一般来说我们的网络请求应该是这样的
       private fun doNetWork() {
        val api &#x3D; DemoRetrofit.apiService.getNews(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;)

        val exceptionHandler &#x3D; CoroutineExceptionHandler { coroutineContext, throwable -&gt;
            YYLogUtils.e(throwable.message ?: &quot;网络错误&quot;)
        }

        MainScope().launch(exceptionHandler) {

            val work &#x3D; async(Dispatchers.IO) {
                api.execute()  //同步请求
            }

            //…</span>

                              <span>如果你想用Flutter技术在桌面端落地，从技术上来讲，你必须解决这三大难题：
1. 应用窗口化，提供窗口操作的能力；
 2. 实现多窗口；
3. 对外设的支持。
前言
首先给个结论，Flutter在桌面端落地，完全是可行的；但生态远没有官方所说的那么完善，我甚至认为其达不到stable的标准。
有Windows、Android系统，系统不同但UI一致，我们将在这两个平台上解决以上问题，并落地Flutter。
一、窗口化和窗口操作存在的问题
实现应用窗口化：即应用是窗口化展示的，同时可拖拽、可以点击应用外的地方。
Flutter Windows本身是窗口化的；
而Android默认是全屏应用，需要让普通应用支持窗口化；若是小工具性质的应用，还需要支持可拖拽、可点击应用外的地方，这些在Flutter上都是需要我们在原生实现的。
实现应用窗口化后，一般开发过程中，肯定会需要以下对窗口的操作：

应用窗体圆形、阴影效果；
配置应用初始的显示位置；（很多小工具可能不是居中展示）
从窗口变为全屏、从全屏变为窗口；
......
二、支持多窗口
目前Flutter是明确不支持多窗口的。官方好像对多窗口不太感兴趣，一直没有把优先级提上来，还是停留在p4级别，具体见issue。
三、窗口化实现方案
1. Windows端
Windows端Flutter默认支持窗口化，交互方式基本符合习惯，因此无需再做开发。
2. Android端
Android普通应用实现窗口化，是把整个应用展示成窗口的效果，但是点击外部窗口外的地方其实是不响应。 同一时间只能显示一个应用进程，这是安卓的机制，也保证了其安全性。要实现窗口化，需要把应用Theme设置成Dialog的样式；同时设置窗口全屏，但是背景色为透明，设置点击外部Dialog不消失，即可实现应用的窗口化展示。

部分效果如下：



MVI架构

由于没有明确的状态管理标准，随着应用程序的增长或添加功能或事先没有计划的功能，视图渲染和业务逻辑可能会变得有点混乱，并且这种情况经常发生在Android应用开发过程中。可能你经常遇到状态管理导致业务逻辑和 UI 渲染的分工不明确，最终导致应用架构的混乱。而新提出的MVI架构，提倡一种单向数据流的设计思想，非常适合数据驱动型的UI展示项目。MVI的架构思想来源于前端，由于Model、View和Intent三部分组成。
Model：与其他MVVM中的Model不同的是，MVI的Model主要指UI状态（State）。当前界面展示的内容无非就是UI状态的一个快照：例如数据加载过程、控件位置等都是一种UI状态
View：与其他MVX中的View一致，可能是一个Activity、Fragment或者任意UI承载单元。MVI中的View通过订阅Intent的变化实现界面刷新（不是Activity的Intent、后面介绍）
Intent：此Intent不是Activity的Intent，用户的任何操作都被包装成Intent后发送给Model进行数据请求

                              <span>豆浆鸡蛋能一起吃吗？菠菜和豆腐呢？其实，所谓“相克”的食物经过适当处理是可以一起吃的：煮熟的豆浆可与鸡蛋同食；菠菜焯水后与豆腐同食就很难产生草酸钙。至于吃虾喝橙汁真的等于吃砒霜吗，一次吃300斤虾再喝大量的橙汁，才可能会有中毒反应。

                              <span>谷歌从安卓中移除大量 Fuchsia 代码

本周，谷歌从安卓开源项目（AOSP）中移除了大量关于 Fuchsia 设备的代码。在谷歌的设想中，Fuchsia 设备可以运行来自安卓和 Linux 等其他系统的应用程序。想要达成这个目标有多种途径，谷歌最早尝试的是在一个虚拟机上运行完整的安卓系统实例，但这存在一些潜在的性能问题。另一种方式就是增强 Fuchsia 和安卓运行时环境的直接关系，在 2019 年时谷歌在 AOSP 里创建了一个项目，能够为 Fuchsia 设备创建安卓运行时。这次这些代码的移除，正式标志着这种方式的终结。在留下的 TODO 信息里，表明谷歌正在创建一个新的 “Starnix” 项目，让 Fuchsia 能够“原生”运行为 Linux/安卓开发的应用和库，即一个从 Linux 的底层内核架构到 Fuchsia 的 Zircon 内核的翻译层。

老王点评：其实，谷歌在操作系统方面的野心很大，只是一直被掩盖在 Windows 和 Mac 下面没那么引人注意。




openSUSE 率先对 Nim 语言提供支持

Nim 语言 是一种新兴的语言，创建于 2005 年。这种经过编译的静态类型的编程语言有一个外部函数接口，可以与 C/C++、JavaScript 和其他语言交互。Nim 自称“结合了 Python、Ada 和 Modula 等成熟语言的成功概念”，以前曾被称为像 C 一样快，又像 Python 一样具有表现力、像 Lisp 编程语言一样可扩展。openSUSE 不仅宣布为 Nim 语言提供最新的软件包，而且对这个静态类型、命令式编程语言的提供一级支持。Nim 的作者及社区对 openSUSE 提供一级支持表示欢欣鼓舞。

老王点评：很多新兴语言都雄心勃勃，但是一种编程语言要成功，真有时候有很多侥幸的地方。




Rocky Linux 9.0 发布

Rocky Linux 9.0 建立在 RHEL 9.0 的基础上，并计划支持近十年，直到 2032 年 5 月。现有的Rocky Linux 8 将继续被支持到 2029 年 5 月。Rocky Linux 渴望成为 CentOS Stream 之前的 CentOS。由于使用了红帽企业 Linux 9.0 的源代码，它的所有功能与 5 月份达到 GA 的那个 RHEL 发行版相同。

老王点评：从目前看起来，Rocky Linux 和 Alma Linux 是最肖似 CentOS 的继承者了。</span>

                              <span>试试这个轻量级的开源工具，不用离开终端就可以预览文件。




查看你的文件和文件夹的最基本方法是使用命令 ls 和 ll。但是有时候，我不仅想看到文件的元数据，还想一目了然地看到文件的内容。为此，我使用 ranger。

如果你喜欢在控制台中工作，并使用 Vim 或 Vi，而且你不想因为任何原因离开你的终端，那么 ranger 就是你最好的新朋友。ranger 是一个精简的文件管理器，它不仅可以让你浏览文件，还可以预览它们。ranger 与 rifle 捆绑在一起，rifle 是一个文件执行器，可以有效地选择与特定文件类型相关的程序。

在 Linux 上安装 ranger

ranger 可以在 Fedora 或任何基于 RPM 的发行版中安装，方法是运行：

$ sudo dnf install ranger


ranger 也可以用于 其他发行版和 macOS。

第一次使用 ranger

作为一个用户，你可以在你喜欢的终端上简单地输入 ranger 来启动 ranger。可以用方向键浏览。这张截图是一个很好的例子，我可以预览存储在 Kernel-tests 中的 config.example 文件的代码。



选中任何文件并按下 F4 键，就可以打开你的默认编辑器，让你立即编辑这些文件！

图像和视频怎么办？

使用 rifle 和 ranger 可以让你快速找到与某一文件相关的程序。将鼠标悬停在图片上，然后试图打开它是非常简单的，只要点击回车即可。下面是它的样子：



在一个图像文件上点击 i 会给用户提供所有的 EXIF 数据。点击 Shift+Enter 将打开这个 PDF 文件。



同样的组合键将在系统默认的支持该编解码器的视频播放器中打开并开始播放视频。下面的例子是一个 mp4 视频，它在 VLC 上播放得很好。



文件操作

除非 Vim 用户另有配置，否则下面的键绑定工作良好。


j：下移

k：上移

h: 移动到父目录

gg：移到列表的顶部

i：预览文件

r：打开文件

zh：查看隐藏文件

cw：重命名当前文件

yy：复制文件

dd：剪切文件

pp：粘贴文件

u：撤销

z：改变设置

dD：删除文件


控制台命令

有时我在起草文章时，有一个文件夹包含某个软件的截图。通过点击空格选择或标记文件，然后输入 :bulkrename，可以帮助我把所有奇怪的时间戳变成如：lorax1、lorax2 等等。下面是一个例子。



其他有用的控制台命令包括：


penwith：用你选择的程序打开一个选择的文件

:touch FILENAME：创建一个文件

:mkdir FILENAME：创建一个目录

:shell ：在 shell 中运行一个命令

:delete：删除文件


在 tty2/3/4 中能工作吗？

作为一个从事质量保证（QA）工作的人，我发现搜索日志和阅读日志从未如此简单。即使我的 Gnome 显示管理器崩溃了，我也可以切换到我的 tty2，用我的用户名和密码登录，并以超级用户权限启动 ranger，然后我就可以尽情地探索了！

ranger 是一个很好的工具，可以在不离开终端的情况下处理文件。ranger 是精简的，也是可定制的，所以不妨一试吧！

                              <span>Arch Linux 在桌面 Linux 世界中非常流行。受欢迎的原因之一是 安装 Arch Linux 本身就是一项复杂的任务。

我没有夸大其词。安装 Ubuntu 或 Debian 比 Arch Linux 容易得多，因为官方没给后者提供图形界面的安装程序。

这时虚拟机就派上用场了。

你可以先在 VirtualBox 中尝试安装 Arch Linux，看看它是否是你想在实际硬件上运行的系统。通过这种方式，你可以在不弄乱当前操作系统的情况下体验 Arch Linux。

在本文，我将一步一步指导你完成一个实用的 Arch Linux 虚拟机的安装过程。

在 VirtualBox 上安装 Arch Linux

毫无疑问，你需要先 在 Linux 上安装 VirtualBox（或在 Windows 上）。在 Windows 上，只需访问 Oracle 的网站并下载 VirtualBox。


下载 VirtualBox


如果你使用的是 Windows 10 或更高版本，请确保你的系统已启用虚拟化。

完成后，你需要到 Arch Linux 官方网站 下载 ISO 文件。你应该找到 使用 torrent 下载 或直接下载文件的选项。



你可以保留 ISO 文件以备不时之需，安装成功后也可以将其删除以 释放系统上的空间。

现在，让我们开始在 VirtualBox 上安装 Arch Linux 吧。

第一部分 创建虚拟机

第一步：首先，你需要在 VirtualBox 中设置一下。启动 VirtualBox 并单击 “新建New” 来创建一个虚拟机。



注意，你可以使用 “向导模式guided mode” 继续创建虚拟机，但使用 “专家模式expert mode” 可以一目了然地获得更多选项。

                              <span>我喜欢 在 Ubuntu 中使用深色模式。在我看来深色模式能够缓解视觉疲劳，让系统看起来更加的赏心悦目。

我发现了一个 gedit 文本编辑器的小麻烦，如果你在深色模式下使用它，你也许也会遇到。

默认情况下 gedit 高亮当前光标所在的行。这是一个非常有用的功能，但是如果你在 Linux 系统中开启了深色模式，那么你将会感到痛苦。为什么？因为被高亮的文本将不再变得可读。你自己看吧：



如果你选择文本，它将变得可读，但这并不是一个让人感到有多么愉快的阅读或者编辑体验。（LCTT 校注：在新的 Ubuntu 22.04 中，这一情况已经有所改善，“高亮当前行”已被取消勾选）



好消息是你不需要再忍受它。我将演示几个步骤让你能够同时享受 gedit 以及系统的深色模式。

让 gedit 在深色模式下阅读体验友好

你基本上有两个选择：


禁用高亮当前行，但也同时意味着你必须清楚地知道你在哪一行。

改变默认的颜色设置，但编辑器的颜色会变得稍微有些不同，而且如果你更改系统主题，它不会自动切换到浅色模式。


在 gedit 或者 GNOME 的开发者解决这个问题之前，这是你必须要做的应变和妥协。

选项1： 禁止高亮当前行

当你打开 gedit 后，点击汉堡菜单然后选择“首选项Preferences”。



在查看选项卡，你应该看到在 “高亮Highlighting” 区域的下方的 “高亮当前行Highlight current line” 选项。取消勾选这个选项，马上就可以看到效果。



“高亮当前行”是一个有用的功能，如果你想继续使用它，请选择第二个选项。

选项2： 更改编辑器的颜色主题

在“首选项Preferences”窗口，找到 “字体与颜色Font &amp; Colors” 标签页，然后将颜色主题更改为 “Oblivion”、“Solarized Dark”，或者 “Cobalt”。



正如我前面所提到的，缺点就是当你把系统主题切换为浅色模式时，编辑器将不会自动切换到浅色模式。

开发者应该修复的一个 bug

这里 有几个 Linux 可用的文本编辑器 ，但是为了快速阅读或编辑文本文件，我更推荐使用 gedit。尽管如此，小烦恼仍旧是小烦恼。开发者应该在将来的版本中为这个很好的文本编辑器修复这个问题，让我们不再求助于这些应对办法。

你呢？你在你的系统上使用深色模式还是浅色模式？你注意到 gedit 的这个问题了吗？你有使用什么方法去解决它吗？欢迎分享你的经验。

求问大家,我想上传一些我录制的算法教学视频,让更多人看到,请问国内有什么好的方案?
原来是上传到 B 站上的,但是发生了一些事件,现在我要全部删除了,所以不会考虑 B 站了
腾讯课堂 申请入驻,需要在个人主页上显示个人的真实照片,我不能接受
不考虑流量的平台
现在想到的是,把课程做成 BT,然后上传到 github 上
想问的是有什么好的方法吗?
我的目的是遵循互联网的分享精神(求不喷),分享我录制的算法课程.</span>

家中宽带情况，光猫桥接，主路由拨号上网；火棒安装了电信官方 IPTV APP 接入公网，可以同时观看 IPTV 和公网。
今天，突然发现宽带 IP 变成内网 10 段 IP ，找电信师傅修改为公网 IP 。
答复是：
“国家安全局要求机顶盒和宽带只能有一个公网 Ip,机顶盒不能用路由模式看！机顶盒要在 itv 口，ppoe 拨号！”
这不是强制只能用 IPTV 机顶盒看电视么，但实在不想用电信的破盒子，现在火棒一物多用很舒服，想火棒继续看 IPTV ，但宽带又想要公网 IP 。
有什么好办法吗</span>

#如题，背景如下：我目前处于处于软件实施这个岗位，平时会用 python 处理一些数据。所以，对 java 理解甚少。公司的各个系统是用 dubbo 连接各个服务的。但 python 没有可以调 dubbo 协议接口的库，所以我想通过 jshell 来调用 dubbo 接口。
#测试使用的是dubbo 示例中的 dubbo-samples-protobuf ，我把服务和客户端分别放在两台机器上，用 maven 编译测试成功后。把 traget 文件夹下 lib 里的 jar 包复制到 jshell 自定义的 class 文件夹里。然后用 jshell 进行测试，代码如下
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context &#x3D; new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(&quot;file:/home/dubbo-consumer.xml&quot;);
context.start();

以上代码片段没有报错，接着输入下面代码，回车测试
context.getBean(&quot;demoService&quot;)

然后报错了：
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name &#x27;demoService&#x27;: FactoryBean threw exception on object creation; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService
at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.FactoryBeanRegistrySupport.doGetObjectFromFactoryBean(FactoryBeanRegistrySupport.java:177)

at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.getBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:197)
at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.getBean(AbstractApplicationContext.java:1080)
at .(#27:1)

然后换成下方代码，再运行同样报错：
public interface DemoService {
    String sayHello(String name);
};
public class DemoServiceImpl implements DemoService {
    public String sayHello(String name) {
        return &quot;Hello &quot; + name;
    }
};
DemoService demoService &#x3D; (DemoService)context.getBean(&quot;demoService&quot;);

各位 V 友好，想请教大家 Mac (Intel) vs. Mac (M1) 在开发 Apple 应用的区别？更具体而言，是想请教以下问题：
1.1 Mac (Intel) 开发上述应用程序能否上架 iPhone 应用商店
1.2 如果能行的话，那么与 Mac (M1) 所开发的程序有什么区别？
2.1 Mac (Intel) 开发上述应用程序能否上架 iPad 应用商店
2.2 如果能行的话，那么与 Mac (M1) 所开发的程序有什么区别？
开发 Mac (macOS) 应用程序（我认为这个是这个帖子的核心，请斧正）
3.1 Mac (Intel) 开发上述应用程序能否上架 Mac 应用商店
3.2 如果能行的话，那么与 Mac (M1) 所开发的程序有什么区别？
3.3 可能存在的衍生问题是，上架 Mac 应用商店和通过自己签名发行软件（没有想清楚对于此条详细准确的描述）
关于问题 3.2 ，从用户和开发者的角度来看，我的思考是存在 2 大类，共 4 种情况：
第一类（上架 Mac 应用商店）

开发者使用 Mac (Intel) 开发的软件
开发者使用 Mac (M1) 开发的软件




使用 Mac (Intel) 的用户
正常使用
无法使用


使用 Mac (M1) 的用户
需要 Rosetta 2 转译后使用
正常使用


第二类（通过自己或第三方来发行软件）

开发者使用 Mac (Intel) 开发的软件
开发者使用 Mac (M1) 开发的软件




使用 Mac (Intel) 的用户
正常使用
无法使用


使用 Mac (M1) 的用户
需要 Rosetta 2 转译后使用
正常使用


期待大家的帮助，感谢。
P.S.
上面的问题略有繁琐和啰嗦，甚至可能有对于同一现象的重复描述，请大家谅解。
请不要将问题的讨论聚焦于两者的性能、温度、噪音、外界拓展性角度（在 V2EX 中已经有大量的讨论）</span>

现在用的 19 款 15 寸英特尔，合盖外接 4K 屏幕温度直接上到 65 度。
因为外接显示器时强制调用独显，Pro555X 发热又很大，看个视频直接飚到 75 度，导致 CPU 开始降频，然后整个系统卡顿，甚至移动鼠标都卡……受够了这种糟糕的体验，之前接的一直都是 1080 的屏幕，所以就还好。
前几天把公司 M1 的 13 寸 mbp 拿回来接同样的屏幕试了试，几个小时全程风扇没有转，而且始终就 30 度左右……差距实在太大了，产生了换机的念头，而且感觉手里的 Intel 越来越卡了（狗头）。
不知道九月会不会出 M2 Pro/Max ，还是说早买早享受？而且感觉 Intel 现在出手的价格越来越低了</span>

一提到区块链，所有人都会说区块链是去中心化的，不会被某个人或者某个组织掌控。但是实际情况区块链真的去中心化了么？
比特币号称是去中心化的，所有节点都能打包区块。但是由于算力的不同，每个节点打包区块的概率是不同的。中国大陆 2019 年的矿池算力占比特币全网算力的 75%，而且这 75%的算力只被前三大矿池掌控。这就意味着，只要这几家矿池聚一块商量一下，就能轻易攻破比特币网络，这还是所谓的“去中心化”么？然后中国镇辅取缔挖矿产业，直接让 75%的算力归零。试想一下，假如中国镇辅想要比特币完蛋，不是取缔，而是收缴全国所有矿机去攻击比特币网络，比特币还能不能存在？
所以，区块链去中心化在逻辑上就站不住脚，你用家用电脑挖矿，大资本家用专用 ASIC 矿机挖矿，人家一台矿机的算力是你家用游戏显卡的几万倍，你怎么比？由于资本的中心化，必然导致算力的中心化，所以区块链去中心话的逻辑根本就站不住脚。
除了算力成本，存储成本也很可怕。比特币历史交易数据现在大概是 400GB ，但是随着交易量的增大和时间的推移，历史数据会急剧膨胀，再过十年可能要几个 TB 才，再过 20 年可能要 PB 的容量，这个存储成本会越来越高，必然导致全节点数量越来越少，到最后算力中心化，存储也中心化。比特币完全就成了笑话。
而且，为了维持去中心化的理念，必须保证节点的数量。但节点数量一多，必然导致全网的交易性能直线下降。要想保证交易性能，必然要采用中心化的措施，自相矛盾。
所以所谓区块链到底有什么价值？既做不到中心化，交易性能还低，那它存在的意义到底什么？</span>

                              <span>Hi all. Today, I am here to talk about a most discussed topic in developer world. Mistakes you should avoid while coding for the first time. I&#x27;ve been coding for around 2 years and I learned a lot of things during these time. Let&#x27;s take a look into those things in detail.
This is not a good method to follow. I&#x27;ve seen many people on different social media platforms with this problem. For example, they try to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at once and they will get stuck. From then onwards, they always believe that coding is hard. Actually, it is not! Most of the people believe that C++ is the most difficult programming language, but I learned C++ by dedicating 7 months of consistent practice.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say we have an array of users, but each user is also an array.
For the example, we&#x27;ll use the following data.
const users &#x3D; [
  [&#x27;Nicole&#x27;, 31],
  [&#x27;Chris&#x27;, 33],
  [&#x27;Yaatree&#x27;, 2],
  [&#x27;Sanne&#x27;, 29],
];

As you can see, each user array holds two objects:
The user&#x27;s name
The user&#x27;s age
How can we quickly return the user with the highest age and the user with the lowest age?
Let&#x27;s find out together.
First, we need to find a way to extract the data, and I thought the reduce method would be a great one for that.
The trick to using this method is to not pass the initial value. This way, we can only start counting from the actual array of items.
const highest &#x3D; users.reduce((previous, current) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return current[1] &gt; previous[1] ? current : previous;
});

console.log(highest);

Simply means we can use GitHub on AWS with any special features. Some of them are easily scale and many more. One of the biggest benefit is can be integrated with other AWS services. Before we talk about it, let me show you how to setup or use it.
How To Use CodeCommit

                              <span>Hey, Josiah here. Today I’ll be discussing the concept of SVMs (Support Vector Machine), a subset of Machine Learning used commonly for classification and regression analysis. First off, we must discuss how SVM works from a theoretical standpoint.

The three lines seen (H1, H2, and H3) are known as “Hyperplanes”, which divide our data into classes. To define a hyperplane, one must follow a simple procedure:
Draw a line between the two classes such that the closest data point from each class (known as the support vector) are equidistant from the line. Thus, we have defined a Hyperplane.
However, it soon becomes apparent that an infinite number of hyperplanes can be derived. The obvious question arises: “How do we determine which hyperplane to use?” The answer is, we use the hyperplane which…</span>

                              <span>Recently, I talked with a bunch of people across several Discord and Slack communities about their thoughts on ORMs and SQL. In this post, I&#x27;ll be breaking down when we should use each, and the sacrifices we would make along the way.  
Before we begin, I would like to clarify that I am not writing this post to bash your technology choices. You are welcome to disagree with me and discuss this topic constructively on Twitter or in the comments below. Feel more than comfortable to continue using what you use, this post just contains my views on why ORMs aren&#x27;t always a great way to represent and model relational data. 
ORM is simply an acronym for object-relational mapping. In simple terms, it&#x27;s basically serves as a layer between relational databases and your applications.

But later the same day, I tried checking something in a test system and noticed that a lot of my requests were taking very long time. In fact, I couldn’t get anything done. Since this environment was also long running, it could not be cold start problem.
Cloudwatch metrics on the load balancer showed that all requests return in 6ms or less and that they are all successful. My home internet seemed fine. Time to get an external view.

                              <span>Want to use bun for your next react projects?






  
  
  Install bun


First run the following command to check bun is installed or not
bun -v

If you don&#x27;t have bun installed then run the following command to install bun
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash

Now run the following command to create a react app
bun create react [your-app-name]

It will create a new directory with the name of your app. To start the app run the following command
cd your-app-name
bun dev

By default bun does not ship with react-scripts so you need to install it first.
bun a react-scripts -d

Here we install it as a dev dependency.
Then run the following command to build the production bundle
bun react-scripts build

When you run the command above it will build the production bundle and it will be stored in the build directory.
scripts to your package.json


We can add the following scripts to our package.json file
{
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;bun dev&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;react-scripts build&quot;
  }
}

Now we can run the following command to start the app
bun start

And we can run the following command to build the production bundle
bun run build

By default bun creates react app with javascript but we can easily use typescript by changing the file extension from .jsx to .tsx

This article was originally published at vtsen.hashnode.dev on Jun 25, 2022.
First of all, I&#x27;m not an Android Studio shortcut keys guy because I can&#x27;t simply remember them. I usually just go to the menu or mouse right click to look for the tasks that I would like to perform.
However, there are 5 Android Studio shortcut keys that I use every day that I can&#x27;t live without. This is only based on my 9 months of Android development experience.
Before I know this shortcut key, I do this

With Control + / shortcut key, I do this

The exact equivalent shortcut key should be Control + Shift + /. Because it requires extra key press, it slows me down. Thus, Control + …</span>

Hello, World! programs have been written in almost every programming language imaginable. As the first program that many people learn, it is generally simple and straightforward. However, some Hello, World! programs can be quite complex and creative.
One of the earliest Hello, World! programs were written by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web. His program simply displayed the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; on a web page.

It&#x27;s hard for me to work in total silence. I need some kind of background noise, preferably some familiar music. My music-listening needs are pretty simple: I just need a music player that plays my library of MP3 music and streams from a few websites I like to listen to.

金曲奖向来是华语乐坛中分量最重、甚至是唯一真正有广泛影响力的音乐奖项。进入分众时代后，金曲奖可能选不出曾经红极华语世界的歌王歌后，但作为审美在线的奖项，他们在发掘新人这件事上焕发了新的生机，许多来自小公司甚至独立发片的艺人依靠优质的作品收获了金曲奖的青睐，一朝提名天下知。这篇文章，我就借着疫情之后的第 31 至 33 届金曲奖最佳新人奖入围名单，聊聊我眼里这几年的风向变化。
看重全能创作
相比注重演唱的「最佳男/女歌手」，最佳新人最近几年明显体现出了注重创作的倾向，而且得奖的歌手也都是创作为主。即使回溯过往的最佳新人，非创作者也寥寥无几。纯粹因为音色和主流唱片表现进入候选名单的，在这三年里可能只有演员跨界歌手的许光汉一位，其他或多或少都有个人创作的成分。而且，入围最佳新人的创作标准之高令人咋舌，毕竟同样是创作歌手但因为唱功突出突然杀进第 31 届歌王竞争的裘德都没有拿到最佳新人的提名1——并且当年被提名的一共有足足七组歌手。
 
在我看来，这正是分众时代的典型表现。市场追求的不一定再是争取打动所有人的大歌，而是让每个创作者找到自己的听众，在自己的经历与体会中写能打动小圈层的故事。比起交给公司操办，拥有创作才能的人可以获得更好的表达机会，写出更好的故事。所以我们在最佳新人听到了更多的独立乐团、兼职歌手，我是把它当好事来看的，当越来越多的人开始创作时，被遴选出的新星才是真正写出时代之声的人。
入围第 31 届金曲奖新人奖的告五人乐队算是一众入围乐队里面传唱度最高的，和其他同样入围的乐队相比，他们的优势包括华语演唱、歌曲氛围轻松…</span>

                              <span>Last week, a guy copied my source code from Github, even the comments I have written in my source code. Since it wasn&#x27;t much big of a project, It didn&#x27;t bother me much (even though I put hours of work into it). In the future, if someone tries to copy my project, how should I proceed? Does having your code on Github mean anyone can copy the code without giving any credit to the owner? I also don&#x27;t want my projects to be private.</span>

Welcome to regular and new readers alike, to the AWS open source newsletter episode #120.
The observant will have noticed that it has been two weeks since the last newsletter. We all need some time off, and I spent most of the time cycling around the hills  of a new cycle route called King Alfreds Way - highly recommended.
There has been some great new projects created over the past couple of weeks, and of course I have you covered and have shared them below. We have &quot;barometer&quot; a really nice tool that can help you automate the evaluation of your analytics solutions, &quot;vscode-infracost&quot; which takes the really nice Infracost tool and enables you to easily use this from within VSCode, &quot;terraform-aws-mwaa&quot; and &quot;emr-serverless-with-mwaa&quot; a couple of projects …</span>

                              <span>In this series I am going to share multiple articles that will teach you from basic to advanced about EC2. So Lets start !!!

EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
Most popular and most used AWS offering.

EC2 &#x3D; Elastic Compute Cloud &#x3D; Infrastructure as a service(IaaS) 


It mainly consists of:
– Renting Virtual machines(EC2)
Storing data on Virtual drives(EBS)
Distributing load across machines(ELB)
Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)
In this you pay only for capacity that you actually use.
EC2 Provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.
Below are some features of EC2:

                              <span>Manual testing and automated testing have their own pros and cons. If you are looking to automate testing of your web app, mobile app, or website then it is necessary to consider the advantages and disadvantages of both manual testing and automated testing.
In manual web &amp; mobile application testing, testers manually test the features of a product by executing test case scenarios written for the same. Usually, manual web &amp; mobile application testers are highly skilled professionals with excellent knowledge about the features to be tested and what conditions the features need to pass in order to be successfully tested. Manual testers often use various tools such as data tables, barcode scanners, etc. to automate their task of test execution.

                              <span>When working with setTimeout we generally don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning up our timeouts.
However, introducing it into React can create some nasty edge-cases.
This often happens because we want to manipulate data after x time.
You might see some edge cases where your interactions seem to be reverted.
The general rule of advice is to keep track of the timeouts you create in your code and clean them.
To clean your timeouts, we can leverage the useEffect cleanup function.
A quick example could look like this:
export default function Test() {
  const [show, setShow] &#x3D; useState(false);
  useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    const test &#x3D; window.setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {
      setShow(false);
    }, 1500);
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {
      clearInterval(test);

Like GitHub, BitBucket is also an application that helps to manage projects&#x27; code throughout the development process. Although GitHub is still regarded as the most popular repository, many users are switching to BitBucket due to its lower costs and the ability to use the private repository (a feature that is only available in the paid version of GitHub).While the fundamental features of BitBucket has a lot in common with GitHub and features like simple Integration with Jira and Trello and built-in CI/CD capabilities can give this tool from Atlassian an advantage.

                              <span>I revisit some of my college notes, and find that in my first year of college, in Algorithm and Programming Course, Bitwise operator was mentioned but wasn&#x27;t highlighted. It&#x27;s either I didn&#x27;t write the notes on that specific topic (I stopped writing notes in my second semester) or the Lecturer didn&#x27;t explain anything about the usage. But then I found it is quite useful for Bitmasking. For example, in Unix&#x27; file access control it uses bitmask to represent the access:
000 &#x3D;&gt; 0 &#x3D;&gt; can&#x27;t access anything
001 &#x3D;&gt; 1 &#x3D;&gt; can only execute
010 &#x3D;&gt; 2 &#x3D;&gt; can only read
011 &#x3D;&gt; 3 &#x3D;&gt; can execute+read
100 &#x3D;&gt; 4 &#x3D;&gt; can only write
101 &#x3D;&gt; 5 &#x3D;&gt; can execute+write
110 &#x3D;&gt; 6 &#x3D;&gt; can read+write
111 &#x3D;&gt; 7 &#x3D;&gt; can execute+read+write

All of those combination can be construct with just only 3 bits. As you can see, Bitmask us…</span>

                              <span>I had already wrote a blog about hosting your react app using github pages. Link : https://bit.ly/3aLFnG9
In this blog, we will see how to host your project using netlify.
By drag and drop
By authorizing github
Lets get started.
Step 1:
Step 2:

Step 3:
npm run build
This will create a folder named &#x27;build&#x27; in your project directory
Simply drag and drop build folder into the above appeared screen.
and Done Netlify will host your project 💥💥
Imagine Let say You had build a project and later you tried to update the project UI then the changes are not gonna reflect in your netlify app.
To make above query to happen, we use method 2
Step 1:
Step 2:

Step 3:
I started learning about material UI and created a small app which generates random quote using an API.

Yes GitHub is a platform developers use, but it&#x27;s not only developers using GitHub. It&#x27;s a platform more and more non-developers are finding and loving. There are lots of tools you can use as a non-developer, or tools you as a developer can encourage your non-dev friends to use.
The reason this is important is collaboration is increasingly required across teams. Collaboration is also one of the four pillars of DevOps.

Elon Musk’s legal team has responded to Twitter’s lawsuit against him, saying that the company is demanding an unreasonably fast trial. In response, Musk’s team asks that the case not be heard until next year, according to Bloomberg.
Twitter has pushed for the trial to take place in mid-September, justifying the request to expedite things given that Musk and Twitter’s merger agreement has an October 24th “presumptive drop-dead date.” However, Musk’s team is asking that the trial not be held until February 13th, 2023 trial at the earliest, Bloomberg reports. 
Twitter declined to comment on the matter, and pointed to its initial complaint filed Tuesday. 
Twitter sued Musk earlier this week after he officially tried to bail on his $44...

A few of us at The Verge have noticed something new about Twitter’s iOS app: when you pull down to refresh your feed, you might hear a couple of new noises. One is a little windup trill that plays when you first pull the feed, and after your feed is done refreshing, you might hear a short confirmation chirp. (Though the sounds are more robotic than any real-life bird I’ve heard.)
I made a recording so you can hear what I’m hearing. It’s a little different from the short “pop” you might have heard when refreshing before.
Anybody else hearing this when you pull to refresh on Twitter’s iOS app? pic.twitter.com/x0BsxbZF2u

We’re not exactly sure when the change kicked in, but we first noticed it...

Previously, a number of reviewers have reported that Apple’s entry-level M2 MacBook Pro’s SSD is significantly slower than that of the M1 MacBook Pro due to the configuration of the storage models in the computer. Apple confirmed to The Verge that the base M2 MacBook Air has the same storage configuration as the Pro, so, naturally, we’ve been wondering if it would suffer from the same issue. Well, we’ve finally gotten our hands on a base model (including 256GB of storage and 8GB of memory) and the answer is: yes, it does. 
Going by the results we’re seeing in Blackmagic’s Disk Speed Test app, the base model of the M2 MacBook Air has write speeds that are generally 15 to 30 percent slower than those of the 512GB model Apple sent The Verge...

After two years of being canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, San Diego Comic-Con’s coming back this year with a vengeance and a sizable stack of announcements, trailer drops, and early screenings of some of the entertainment industry’s most hyped projects. 
While there’s almost no way to see absolutely everything that’s going down during this year’s SDCC, knowing where and when some of the convention’s biggest panels are taking place is a solid way to get the most out of your time if you’re on the con floor (or just following along from home). Here are all of the biggest film and television panels happening at SDCC 2022 that news-hungry fans are going to want to keep an eye on.

Halo Infinite’s network campaign co-op test flight is finally live, developer 343 Industries announced Friday. As part of the test, you’ll be able to play the campaign with up to three of your friends, and the game supports crossplay across Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC. The test also includes a mission replay feature, which wasn’t included with the game at launch.
Before you jump onto Zeta Halo with your friends, you should know that you’ll be starting the campaign from scratch in this test. Any progress you’ve made in the retail build of the game won’t carry over, and anything you accomplish in the test won’t show up in your retail build, either. But if it’s been a while since you played through Halo Infinite’s campaign, starting...

ESPN is raising the price of its standalone ESPN Plus streaming service from $6.99 per month to $9.99 per month, a nearly 43 percent increase, beginning August 23rd, as reported earlier by Sports Business Journal. The price of the annual plan is also going up from $69.99 to $99.99. 
If you get your streaming ESPN service as a part of the Disney bundle, however, which packages Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and ad-supported Hulu for $13.99 per month (including Hulu without ads takes the price to $19.99 per month), that will remain at the same price as before. The service’s website and support pages haven’t been updated to reflect the increase yet, but a statement sent over by Disney spokesperson Paul Melvin indicates subscribers will be notified...

The Sims 4 is making it easier for players to create Sims that better reflect their lived experiences. As a free update coming at the end of the month along with the High School Years expansion, players can now choose their Sims’ sexual orientation and romantic / sexual attraction.
It works like this: within the “Create a Sim” function, you’ll be able to fiddle with how your Sim experiences sex and romance. First, you can choose if your character is attracted to men or women. The Sims 4 team is aware that making this choice based on binary options isn’t ideal.
“I understand that there will be concerns here around the initial options being gender binary,” SimGuruJessica, the design lead on the High School Years expansion wrote in the...

Amazon’s Prime Air delivery drones will begin testing in Texas soon. The drone delivery tests are happening in College Station, Texas, along with a test area announced last month located in Lockeford, California. 
The current MK27-2 design (shown above) has a hexagonal shape that Amazon says increases stability as well as propellers that the company claims will minimize high-frequency soundwaves.


The company originally announced plans to create a 30-minute drone delivery service in 2013 and showed off this now-dated video (embedded above) as a demonstration of what the future might be like. Amazon showed off redesigned drones with hybrid VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) capabilities in 2019 and received approval from the Federal...

                              <span>In yet another reminder of just how flexible Valve’s Steam Deck handheld gaming PC can be, an enterprising Redditor has gotten the Playdate Simulator running on their Steam Deck, as shared on Twitter by Valve designer Lawrence Yang.
The Playdate, if you’re not familiar, is Panic’s tiny yellow handheld with a crank, but similar to the long reservation queue for the Steam Deck, Playdate preorders are backed up for months. If you place a Playdate preorder right now, it isn’t expected to ship until 2023. If you already have a Steam Deck and want to mess around with the Playdate’s old-school vibes, though, it looks like it’s possible to do that by installing the free Playdate Simulator.
You can see a video of the simulator running on Steam...

                              <span>Microsoft is changing how it releases major versions of Windows again, and it could mean we see a Windows 12 release in 2024. Windows Central reports that Microsoft is shifting back to a three-year release cycle for Windows, which means the next major version of Windows is now due in 2024. It’s another big change to how Microsoft develops Windows.
Microsoft originally moved away from its three-year cycle with the release of Windows 10 in 2015, prioritizing the idea of Windows as a service. Instead of a big release of features every three years in a new Windows release, Windows 10 was updated twice a year with big new features. For years, many Windows watchers thought Windows 10 would be the last big bang release of Windows, after a...

Intel is getting ready to increase the prices of its CPUs and chips. Nikkei reports that the chip maker will raise prices on its flagship CPUs and a wide range of other chips later this year, including Wi-Fi and other connectivity chips. Intel has already informed its customers of the price increases, and it will likely lead to more PC and laptop price increases during the holiday period.
Nikkei reports that pricing hasn’t been finalized, but some chips could go up by 20 percent. Intel already warned earlier this year that it was looking at price increases for certain chips, due to ongoing inflation and the rising costs of materials, shipping, and labor. “On its Q1 earnings call, Intel indicated it would increase pricing in certain...

After months of teasing and overhyping, the Nothing Phone 1 is finally here. We got our hands on the device this week and determined it’s mostly just a regular smartphone with a cool translucent rear — so wouldn’t it be cool if you could have that look on the phone you already own?
That’s what device outfitter company Dbrand set out to do, and it wound up making… Something. It’s a collection of skins and cases that match the geometric white and gray style of the Nothing Phone 1’s visible internals, but you’re able to pair them with select iPhones, Pixels, and other devices.

What if you could use the augmented reality features of a LiDAR-equipped iPhone to see how a room might look with all its furniture removed? That’s the idea behind a new AR prototype shown off by Shopify’s Russ Maschmeyer on Twitter. The demo, which he refers to as a “reset button” for a room, puts Ikea’s virtual design tool to shame. But it’s just an internal experiment for now that offers an interesting peek at the kinds of experiences that could be possible with Apple’s latest AR APIs. 
In a video, Maschmeyer shows how the prototype is able to seamlessly erase a room’s contents, allowing the iPhone to be used to peer around the empty space in AR. In subsequent tweets, Maschmeyer explains how the technology might one day be useful for...

Prime Day may be done and dusted, but there are still plenty of awesome deals to be found at Amazon and other retailers. Right now, for instance, are still plenty of discounts to be found on true wireless earbuds, laptops, TVs, video games, and a host of other tech. A few of the highlights still available include the Beats Fit Pro — which are still discounted to $159.95 (normally $200) — as well as the Apple Watch SE, which currently starts at $230 ($49 off) $219 ($60 off).
We’ll continue to update this page by adding any products that we might have missed and removing anything that’s no longer available, so make sure to check back regularly.

                              <span>这是一张5亿像素的硬币图，拍摄了30多组每组约10张照片，HeliconFocus堆栈，ptgui拼接。
都是手动调整位置和对焦，光是拍就花了4个小时。
使用器材：尼康D7100、195plan4X物镜、千分尺移动台。

这张图我也上传了网盘

                              <span>移动端app容灾
可能很多人对这个概念比较陌生，我们常说的容灾策略，一般都特指服务器端的容灾，那么移动端容灾是个啥！其实跟服务器一样，就是持续保证我们app的可用性，在crash或者anr的时候，能够通过一些手段实现保证后续可用。
本篇不涉及复杂技术，更多的是对方案的探讨，请放心食用！
为什么会有这个概念
其实在笔者角度上看，技术与业务的关系其实是比较单一的，虽然不至于对立，但是一个业务人员看待技术，最关心的可能就是稳定性了，在“老板”角度上看，他其实不太关心所用的技术是什么，但是一定关心这个服务能不能保证自己的业务能不能持续，这也是笔者访谈了几位非技术人员得出的结论，同时在“降本增效”的今天，追求稳定性可能是大部分公司的选择了。还有就是站在长远立场上看，移动端的容灾也慢慢会成为各大公司角逐的一个点。一个由于crash导致而离开的用户，就有可能带走10个相关联客户，在app场景如此，在游戏场景也是，如果打着游戏突然闪退了，肯定是一个非常不好的体验。
本文希望介绍一些移动端的容灾策略，希望能够给各大开发者提供一个启发。
容灾策略
降级
首先是第一个策略，降级，比如app crash的时候，我们采用降级的手段，转移到h5页面

这个方案的特点是 存在两套页面，一个是原生页面，一个是h5页面，大部分公司可能都会同时有这两套ui，一个用于投放app，一个用于h5页面，比如网页还有m站这些。
当主页（也可以是特定activity），跳转到其他页面时，如果发生了crash，就从主页直接打开h5容器，展示h5页面，这个在拼*多app方案上常用
进程多活
android在多进程上给我们提供了很多便捷的地方，只需要在activity或者其他的manifest文件上声明process即可
android:process&#x3D;&quot;:test&quot;

一般我们不做特殊配制的话，activity等就是运行在以包名为名称的进程上。这里的多进程方案有两个
app crash的时候，通过安全气囊机制，重新为用户打开到当前页面，即我们会杀掉原本的进程，重新打开一个新进程，并为用户定位到当前页，可以携带本地的tag或者其他标识进行页面的定位，这个方案可以运用在游戏中，如果crash了立马主动帮用户重开，并提高这部分用户的载入速度！

（这也是我最推荐的）app crash/anr的时候，不重新进入原页面，而是通过安全气囊机制，打开一个纯净版的链路这个链路是怎么理解呢？这里特指是业务简单的链路，即满足用户最基本需求的链路。比如说我们有一个商城app，那么下单就是最关键的链路，我们只需要在app crash的时候，打开一个业务最简单的页面，让用户去操作即可，这样就避免二次可能产生的crash！

强制升级
如果某个用户在app的crash次数达到一定时，就直接采取强制升级的方案，让用户的app始终保持最新版本，避免由于老版本的影响导致这部分的用户流失。这个方案的实现可直接对接到app内的升级策略
脏数据清除
有一些crash可能是由于用户本地的脏数据引起而导致的，那么我们可以在crash的时候，把这部分数据清除，或者简单来说直接清除所有缓存，这种“重置”操作会一定程度上避免由于脏数据等特定crash的发生。
安全气囊机制
可以看到，无论是哪一个方案，我们都需要依靠crash/anr检测的机制，才能够实现，没关系，相关的文章早已准备好黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！，同时也配备了开源库Signal，运用Signal，我们可以实现很多crash后的安全措施，也希望大家运行起来demo，尝试一下各种脑洞大开的方案！
让业务能够持续稳定下去，降低由于异常导致的损失，这是笔者一开始想要实现的，当然，目前我们的库还在不断完善的过程中，也希望广大开发者能够加入进来，一起去探索一个新方向！
最后
本来决定要分享asm相关的，但是在洗澡的过程中发现其实很多对服务器端的容灾策略的思想也是可以在移动端上去进行的，在app的业务迭代过程中，一定会对稳定性造成很多挑战，在各大公司人员缩减的背景下更是如此，所以说，建立一套安全气囊装置，一定会是后面多个公司的探索方向！

变量声明
关键字 var
通过 var 声明一个变量，如果这个变量在声明时赋值了，此时类型就已经确定了，再次赋值时不能更改其他类型。
var str &#x3D; &quot;hello dart&quot;;
// 因为声明时已经赋值为String，所以不能更改类型
str &#x3D; 3;  // 编译器会报错
str &#x3D; &quot;nihao&quot;; //再次赋值只能为String类型

因为 Dart 本身是一个强类型语言，任何变量都是有确定类型的，在 Dart 中，当用var声明一个变量后，Dart 在编译时会根据第一次赋值数据的类型来推断其类型，编译结束后其类型就已经被确定。
关键字 dynamic和Object
Object是Dart所有对象的基类，就是说在 Dart 中所有类型都是Object的子类(包括Function和Null)，所以任何类型的数据都可以赋值给Object声明的对象。 dynamic与Object声明的变量都可以赋值任意对象，且后期可以改变赋值的类型，这和 var 是不同的，如：
dynamic str &#x3D; &quot;hi dart!&quot;;
str &#x3D; 4;
​
Object src &#x3D; 34.32;
src &#x3D; &quot;nihao&quot;;

这样赋值时没有任何问题的，这时候有人会问，既然用 dynamic 和 object 都可以让变量赋值任何类型，那么这两个有什么区别呢？ dynamic 与 Object 不同的是 dynamic 声明的对象编译器会提供所有可能的组合，而 Object 声明的对象只能使用 Object 的属性与方法, 否则编译器会报错，如:
dynamic a &#x3D; &quot;hi dart!&quot;;
​
Object b &#x3D; &quot;nihao&quot;;
​
// 正常打印  值为8
print(a.length);
// 报错
print(b.length);

面板展示
还记得之前封装的GameView吗？这里是全部逻辑，在GameWidget之上还有一层Stack，用于不同面板的展示。需要注意的是GameView的父Widget为MultiBlocProvider，这样它的子Widget才能获取得到GameStatusBloc。
class GameView extends StatelessWidget {
  const GameView({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(

                              <span>谷歌正式推出可装在普通电脑的 ChromeOS Flex 操作系统

ChromeOS Flex 是一个基于 ChromeOS、兼容大部分硬件的操作系统，谷歌官方表示经过验证的设备已经“超过 400 款”。ChromeOS Flex 可以下载到 USB 设备中，然后在 Mac 或者 Windows 设备上进行安装。它于今年 2 月推出，主要基于谷歌在 2020 年收购的 CloudReady 的技术。它最大的优势就是能够让老旧设备“焕发生机”，尤其是那些原生系统已经无法再获得软件更新的设备。在未经谷歌认证的设备上同样可以安装 ChromeOS Flex，只要这些设备符合官方的最低要求。

尼康停止单反相机的开发

配备高清摄像头的智能手机正在侵蚀相机市场，尼康表示今后将专注于开发逐渐在市场上成为主流的、引进人工智能和图像处理技术的无反相机。尼康在 1959 年推出首款单反相机 Nikon F，自 2020 年 6 月推出面向专业人士的旗舰机型 D6 后，再未推出过单反相机的新产品。单反相机的优势是可以根据被拍摄物体和摄影环境更换镜头。尼康在单反相机的销量份额上仅次于佳能，排在世界第 2 位。佳能也计划在数年内结束单反相机的旗舰机型的开发。

谷歌高管认为 Instagram 和 TikTok 在侵蚀该公司核心产品

TikTok 对谷歌业务的威胁不限于视频服务 YouTube，谷歌公司高管承认 Instagram 和 TikTok 危及到了公司核心产品：搜索和地图。新一代的用户的搜索习惯和以前的用户不同，他们不是输入查询词，而是倾向于通过更沉浸的方式发现内容。比如在搜寻餐馆时，四成的年轻人不是打开谷歌地图或搜索，而是打开 TikTok 或 Instagram。

                              <span>为何小小的单板机是智能工作以及小型办公室的未来。




随着疫情的大流行，我们的工作方式也正在发生着改变。工作的分散化正在成为所有公司需要面临的一项重要挑战。

智能办公室

即使工厂认为智能办公仅仅是通过虚拟私有网络来对员工的笔记本电脑进行远程控制，再稍微增加一点进化也可以让一些基本的办公服务离人们更近一点，这些都能够极大降低数据中心的负载，并且提高人们的工作体验。这个方案还有一个额外的影响就是从信息和通信技术（ICT）上来说消除了许多单点故障。

与其在公司外部有成百上千的工作场地，不如在世界范围内有着成百上千的小型办公室/分支，这就是所谓的“智能办公室”。

这种表述可能会让许多 ICT 专家感到恐慌，因为这种文化使得每个办公室都与一台大机器（即服务器）联系在一起，即使分散计算资源的优势非常明显。

一个不同的角度

如果你能用一块 50 美元的小开发板提供一个大服务器的服务会怎么样？如果这个小板子只需要一张 SD 卡和一个普通的 USB 电源支持，那又会怎么样呢？这就是 树莓派 是最灵活的解决方案的原因所在。

树莓派开发板是尺寸非常小的运行 Linux 的计算机。它有一个由树莓派基金会提供和维护的操作系统：树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。它基于 Debian，并与这个最知名的 Linux 发行版共享许多软件包。此外，许多树莓派的开发板能够完美运行最知名的 Ubuntu 服务器，它涵盖了 ARM 处理器支持，提供了对低功耗处理器的支持。

但树莓派开发板对小公司来说也是一个很好的机会，以能够承担得起的代价获得大量的（开源）服务。但这种情况下，你必须考虑数据丢失的风险，因为你把所有的服务运行在一个小的、消费级的硬件上。不过设置正确的备份/恢复程序能够降低这些风险。

你能从树莓派开发板上提供什么服务？

大多数服务通常由更昂贵的服务器提供。这里的“大多数”取决于一些限制：


ARM 处理器： 一些软件包只支持 x86/x64 处理器。这是最难克服的挑战之一。但另一方面，ARM 处理器的市场份额不断增长，使得程序员为他们的软件开发了兼容 ARM 处理器的版本。

内存容量： 这是一个仅限于在复杂应用以复杂的方式进行复杂的计算的情况下讨论的问题。很多时候，这只不过是关于重新审查代码、拆分步骤，并保持简单高效的问题。此外，如果一个服务虽然只服务少数几个用户，但需要大量的内存/CPU，这大概也意味着此服务没有正常工作。这可能是你消除浪费资源的旧问题的一个机会。最后，最新的树莓派开发板把内存容量升级到了 8GB，这是一个很大的提升。

对服务器没有经验的用户： 这是另一个问题，你可以在基础镜像所在的树莓派的 micro-SD 卡中存储系统和运行数据。


也就是说，你能够用树莓派做很多有趣的事情。在 我的博客 里，我通过运行各种服务进行了测试 —— 从基本的 LAMP 服务器到复杂的 CRM。从简单到复杂系统，全部都是开源的，例如：


代理服务器（也能够添加广告拦截服务）

电子邮件服务器

打印服务器

酒店管理

联系关系管理（CRM）

私人社交网络

私人论坛

私有 Git 门户网站

网络监控服务器

许多其他有用的服务


对树莓派来说，另一个有趣的用法是在你的远程办公室获得提供高级服务的 Wi-Fi 热点，并且可以从它的以太网端口进行控制。

最后，树莓派也能够运行容器，这是一个额外的工具，从这个不可思议的开发板中获得一个可用的服务世界。

这里的「导入」，类似于印象笔记那种，发现了好文章可以导入到 App 里面。数据是文本格式，每次 1KB 的量级。
目前我想到的有：
用浏览器插件。这得有账号和服务器。
拍照识别。要考虑识别准确率，也可能不方便。
大家还有什么思路吗？</span>

希望尽量避免使用“复制——粘贴”的办法，因为这种方法一个是比较耗时，其次就是这样做会导致事后使用的过程中可能会出现一些问题，因为有些软件可能在直接复制到另一个硬盘后可能会出现无法使用的问题。</span>

说说我现在用的 spacedesk ，连接快速稳定（可能是因为不依赖 appleid ，比原生随航都好连），目前还是免费，接近完美了。配置很简单，甚至把 iphone 也秒变成副屏。
但缺点也很硬伤：就是延迟稍微大，也不是不能忍受，就是没有 sidecar 那么流畅。另外是没多点触控，这个在测试的时候有些不便。</span>

RT ，
基本情况
型号 x1 gen8 ，前天突然出现充不进电的情况。windos 下用 
powercfg /batteryreport

显示 充满容量 大于 设计容量。真是活见鬼了！电池损耗为 0 ，循环 400+

充了一天，一直显示 99%，还有 57 分钟充满，实际上根本充不满的，充满容量 大于 设计容量，软件怎么可能认为是充满的。
然鹅，当拔掉电源，不到 2 分钟，从 99% 掉到 5%

原因分析
使用习惯不规律： 最近一段时间，每天充一次电，拔电，直到提示电量不足，我再去充，有时电量不足关机了，我才去充。
尝试解决方法
尝试过的解决办法：
1.power 键按住 60s ，无果。
2.按住后面的 reset 60s ，无果。
3.拆后盖，拆下电池，按住 power 60s 放静电，无果。
咨询
请问，这种情况下，最有可能是什么地方出现了问题？充电芯片 or 电芯 or 主板，请不吝赐教，谢谢。</span>

使用无序 map 来记录字符串中字符的个数
unordered_map strmap;
for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; s.size(); i++)

  strmap[s[i]]++;

以上的写法是规范的吗？
strmap[s[i]]++ 看起来好像是先插入，后初始化为 0 ，再进行+1 操作。
但像int a; 这种，a 的值不是未知的吗</span>

做为一个前端开发也比较喜欢阅读关于前端技术文章，所以经常会从掘金、CSDN 、Segmentfault ，甚至是国外等主流的技术站点去挖掘一些点赞数、热门的技术文章来阅读，这样做也可以增加自己的技术广度，有时候一些困惑自己很多天的难题，也可以从别人的文章获取解决的灵感！

主要是想 尽量脱离鼠标编程，才有了以后这个烦恼。
使用 ctrl+D 后进行多行编辑后，光标还是同时存在多个，需要鼠标再点一下，才能恢复单个光标。
装了 ctags 插件，设置了跳转定义和返回都是 纯键盘操作了，这个倒是很方便。

这是简化的网络拓扑图

搞了好久的旁路由下主机端口映射，不想通过主路由映射旁路由再映射主机的方式， 所以直接把旁路由的防火墙转发打开了，只在主路由端口映射到主机，一开始怎么弄都不通，后面多种组合测试， 最终是通了。
在不开启 passwall 时一切正常， 在公司网络可以通过 ddns 域名加端口访问主机服务， 开启 passwall 后就不行了，但接下来的情况就有点蒙了，机缘巧合下，我公司的电脑 ss 开了全局代理，此时服务突然就又通了。。
也就是说如果 passwall 开启， 那我必须也要通过代理才能连回家里主机，难道这还能组成局域网？  关键是我又试了几个不同的代理节点，passwall 的节点甚至不需要和我电脑节点相同也可以。
然后我又看了 passwall 的 tcp 不转发端口，但把端口加进去后不连代理还是访问不了主机

近年来，前后端分离已经成为中大型软件项目开发的最佳实践。
在技术层面，前后端分离指在同一个 Web 系统中，前端服务器和后端服务器采用不同的技术栈，利用标准的 WebAPI 完成协同工作。这种前后端分离的&quot;混合开发&quot;模式下，前后端通常会部署到不同的服务器上，即便部署在同一台机器，因为宿主程序（如后端用 Tomcat ，前端用 nginx ）不同，端口号也很难统一。

（图片来源网络）
这意味着位于 A 域（如https://foo:80/website） 的页面，需要调用 B 域的 WebAPI （如https://bar:8080/webservice），这是一个典型的跨域访问，浏览器默认会判定该操作有安全风险。如果不进行处理，则会拒绝这次 WebAPI 调用，提示对应的错误。

（跨域请求导致的错误）
现在如何该怎么解决跨域的问题呢？目前有 4 个主流技术方案：
JSONP
如果你需要处理的请求只有 GET ，可以考虑 JSONP 。
JSONP 的原理就是利用&lt;script&gt;标签没有跨域限制的特点，通过&lt;script&gt;标签 src 属性，发送带有 callback 参数的 GET 请求，服务端将接口返回数据拼凑到 callback 函数中，返回给浏览器，浏览器解析执行，从而前端拿到 callback 函数返回的数据。

（ JSONP 的调用流程）
这种做法很常规，但是你需要为前端提供 JSONP 的响应，其他终端调用时提供不带 JSONP 的响应，因此会带来额外的开发和测试工作量。
iFrame
通常情况下，前后端分离带来的跨域访问都局限在同一个主域的不同子域（如 a.foo.com 和 b.foo.com ）之间。所以，你可以利用 iFrame 加载位于被调用 WebAPI 所在域的页面，然后将两个页面的 …</span>

看着相册里保存的杂乱动漫图片，萌生了这个想法。
最开始还想着用机器学习自动识别分类，了解后发现这个工作量太大了，最后采用在录入过程中手动进行分类。
简单几步，就可以将图片和角色相关联，之后你就可以通过角色查看她出现的图片或者截图等，方便查找。
使用 SwiftUI 开发的，图片其实都通过 App 存储在系统「文件」 App 中，资源都在你自己手中，确保离开 App 你也能随时访问图片。

                              <span>huzhikuizainali: 老师说数值分析属于建模的后续步骤。建模是将具体问题转化成数学模型。数值分析则解决数学模型算得快算得准的后续问题。通常打数学竞赛都是一个建模好的人和一个数值好的人组团。
那么学机器学习和统计的人需要学数值分析么？需要学多深？
以机器学习为例
第一类人，研究新的机器学习算法，完善已有的机器学习算法我觉得他们应该是需要良好的数值分析功底，应该还有建模的人和他们搭配。
第二类人，用第一类人的成果去解决实际问题。这类人是不是不需要再去研究建模了吧？如果用的都是三方库已有的模型，那三方库必定已经针对算法匹配了最好的数值算法了。所以第二类人不需要很高的数值分析能力吧？不知道我理解的对不对呢？
还有第三类学机器学习的人么？他们需要掌握数值分析么？
以上几个问题还请大家指教。另外统计专业的需要对数值分析掌握到什么程度呢？学数值分析是用 R 来上机练习么？</span>

相同的 fq 环境，图一是我账号登录状态，我搜任何内容都是只展示第一项然后就一直在加载，也加载不出什么新的内容。
图二是无痕模式，google 账号没有登录，就正常能搜索出内容。
一开始以为是正常模式下有什么插件干扰，都关了也一样，退出登录后就显示正常搜索结果。
去账号设置里看了一圈 也并没有什么发现搜索结果相关设置，很奇怪。

Several great options for checking disk usage on your Linux system have a graphical interface. Sometimes the visual representation of disk utilization is easier or newer users may not be as familiar with the various Linux commands that display storage information. I am a person who comprehends visual representations more easily than the printout on the command line.
Here are several excellent GUI-based tools to help you understand how your storage capacity is used.
GNOME Disk Usage Analyzer
My Pop!_OS system relies on the GNOME Disk Usage Analyzer, and they call it &quot;Disk Usage Analyzer.&quot;

                              <span>这次佳明旗舰级全新自行车码表 Edge 1040 的升级堪称史诗级。
史诗级升级是什么呢？
当然是极其先进的 Type-C 口了！
历经多年，佳明终于在新产品中普及了更加通用的 Type-C 数据/充电口，关于佳明的 Micro-USB 和厨子的 Lighting 谁库存更多的历史难题终于得到了答案。当然这只是调侃，Type-C 口是佳明全新旗舰级自行车运动码表 Edge 1040 上重的大更新升级，但并不是重要的升级，因为这次的 Edge 1040有大把的软硬件升级让 1040 配得上“旗舰级”这一称号。

佳明是自行车圈内最大也是产品线最完整的科技厂商，旗下的产品泾渭分明，同产品线的各级别产品界限清晰刀法精准，以其最出名的码表为例：
Edge 130 Plus是入门级产品，黑白屏，能满足基本的自行车码表功能，虽然阉割了进阶的训练功能，但又能完美融入佳明生态圈，甚至还有 Climb Pro 这样的实用功能，之前也用过一段时间这个的前代。
 
Edge 530 是主打的全能机型，在三年前发布后迅速成为了爆款，除了祖传的 Micro-USB 外找不到什么硬件上的短板，几乎是可以无脑买的那种。 
Edge 830 是触屏版的 530，功能完全相同，但操作改为了更为直观的触摸操控，主打中高端用户，这两款机型可以参考当年的评测。
 
Edge 1030 Plus 是理论上的旗舰机型，是老旗舰 1030 的小更新，相当于在 530/830 基础上升级了超大触摸屏和一些独有的训练功能，软件系统也有优化。但由于是小改款，除了先天大屏优势外比起 530/830 并没有明显的硬件优势，颇有些尴尬，去年也用过，最后又用回了 530。
 
这次的 1040 不一样，是在性能和功能上碾压其他码表的旗舰级机型，诸多的硬件和软件升级让其无愧于“机皇”名号，可以预见将会是 530 系列后再创辉煌的新一代…</span>

Chrome OS, Google’s Linux-based operating system for its Chromebook devices, has been around for more than a decade, but the company has made a small but notable branding change: it’s now called ChromeOS, with no space in between.

New car events are usually pretty cringe, full of pointless pyrotechnics, emotionless futurescapes, shameless pandering to “the youth,” or hapless CEO antics. (Remember Elon Musk’s Cybertruck window smash fail? Simpler times.)

The hit online puzzle Wordle is being turned into a multiplayer board game. The New York Times, which purchased Wordle earlier this year, is partnering with Hasbro to bring Wordle from the digital world to the physical one as Wordle: The Party Game later this year.
Wordle rose to prominence in large part because, at least for a little while, it seemed like literally everyone was sharing their results on Twitter. But actually solving a Wordle puzzle is generally a solitary endeavor. In Wordle: The Party Game, though, Wordle becomes a group activity.
One player thinks of a five-letter word that other players have to try and guess first. Once people have made their guesses, the word-thinker will slide translucent yellow and green tiles over...

For years, the UK government has been cooking up legislation to more tightly regulate online spaces. Provisions in the Online Safety Bill include mandatory age-checks on porn sites and jail time for tech execs who withhold data from investigators. Now, these ambitious and controversial plans have been delayed, as the Conservative government faces a leadership election after the resignation of Boris Johnson as party leader.
The Online Safety Bill was due to be voted on by the House of Commons next week, but this  vote has now been delayed until after parliament’s summer recess, according to reports from BBC News and other outlets. The delay is — in theory — temporary, but could prove fatal for the bill if the next UK prime minister...

Nintendo has acquired CG production company Dynamo Pictures, and will rename it to “Nintendo Pictures,” the company has announced. The new subsidiary will “focus on development of visual content utilizing Nintendo IP” and the “planning and production of visual content including CG animation.” The company’s IMDB page lists credits on dozens of titles, including motion capture work on Death Stranding and Persona 5, and post-production work on Metroid: Other M. 
The acquisition comes as Nintendo is gearing up for the most significant cinematic release in years; an animated movie based on the Super Mario Bros. franchise starring Chris Pratt. The film is currently scheduled to release in spring next year, almost thirty years after the last...

Welcome once again, friends, to the best tech deals Amazon Prime Day 2022 has to offer. It’s now the end of day two, and our Verge Deals team is just about done highlighting the deals and discounts that are actually worth a damn. Instead of trudging through Amazon’s annual garage sale of overstock items yourself, however, let us help you. 
There are definitely still some worthwhile discounts for those in the market for wireless earbuds, smart home tech, phones, TVs, games, and some other odds and ends. For example, the Beats Fit Pro are some of the best earbuds around and they’re $40 off, as is the unique Samsung M8 monitor / smart TV hybrid, which is on sale in green for $180 off.
Our goal is to focus on tech products that we know are...

The best phone prices undeniably come from wireless carriers — but they also come with a lot of strings attached, like lengthy contracts and requirements to stay on expensive unlimited plans. Buying unlocked means that you aren’t tied to a particular carrier or plan, and that’s why we recommend purchasing a phone that way if you can. Unfortunately, it also means missing out on the “free” phone offer.
While Amazon isn’t giving out any free phones on Prime Day, you’ll find the next best thing: significant discounts on current models, with no contract or trade-in required. Here you’ll find the very best wireless deals on Prime Day, from accessories to flagships to 4G-only phones, with no strings in sight.

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · Android-NoteBook 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 跟我一起成长。
前言
生命周期是 Activity 的核心特性之一，也是 Android 视图开发无法规避的重要问题。 为了更加健壮地处理生命周期问题，Google 的解决方案是将生命周期定义为一套标准的行为模式，即 Lifecycle 框架。 这种方式不仅简化了在 Activity / Fragment 等生命周期宿主中分发生命周期事件的复杂度，还提供了自定义生命周期宿主的标准模板。
Lifecycle 是多个 Jetpack 组件的基础，例如我们熟悉的 LiveData 就是以 Lifecycle 为基础实现的生命周期感知型数据容器，因此我们选择将 Lifecycle 放在 Jetpack 系列的第一篇。
从这篇文章开始，我将带你全面掌握 Jetpack 组件，系列文章：
一、架构组件：
1、Lifecycle：生命周期感知型组件的基础（本文）
2、LiveData：生命周期感知型数据容器
3、ViewModel：数据驱动型界面控制器
4、Flow：LiveData 的替代方案
5、从 MVC 到 MVP、MVVM、MVI：Android UI 架构演进
6、ViewBinding：新一代视图绑定方案

                              <span>前言：
🏀在我们日常开发中，经常要和数据打交道，所以存储数据是很重要的事。Android从最开始使用SQLite作为数据库存储数据，再到许多的开源的数据库，例如QRMLite，DBFlow，郭霖大佬开发的Litepal等等，都是为了方便SQLite的使用而出现的，因为SQLite的使用繁琐且容易出错。Google当然也意识到了SQLite的一些问题，于是在Jetpack组件中推出了Room，本质上Room也是在SQLite上提供了一层封装。因为它官方组件的身份，和良好的开发体验，现在逐渐成为了最主流的数据库ORM框架。
🌟Room官方文档：https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/androidx/releases/room
🌟SQL语法教程：https://www.runoob.com/sqlite/sqlite-tutorial.html
🚀本文代码地址：https://github.com/taxze6/Jetpack_learn/tree/main/Jetpack_basic_learn/room
为什么要使用Room？Room具有什么优势？
Room在SQLite上提供了一个抽象层，以便在充分利用SQLite的强大功能的同时，能够享有更强健的数据库访问机制。
Room的具体优势：
有可以最大限度减少重复和容易出错的样板代码的注解
简化了数据库迁移路径
针对编译期SQL的语法检查
API设计友好，更容易上手，理解
与SQL语句的使用更加贴近，能够降低学习成本
对RxJava、 LiveData 、 Kotlin协程等都支持
Room具有三个主要模块
Entity: Entity用来表示数据库中的一个表。需要使用@Entity(tableName &#x3D; &quot;XXX&quot;)注解，其中的参数为表名。
Dao: 数据库访问对象，…</span>

前言
在引入 fl_chart 绘制图表的时候，看到插件有下面这样的动效，随机散乱的圆点最后组合成了 Flutter 的 Logo，挺酷炫的。本篇我们来探讨类似的效果怎么实现。

点阵
在讲解代码实现之前，我们先科普一个知识，即点阵。点阵在日常生活中很常见，比如广告屏，停车系统的显示，行业内称之为 LED 显示屏。

LED 显示屏实际上就是由很多 LED 灯组合成的一个显示面板，然后通过显示驱动某些灯亮，某些灯灭就可以实现文字、图形的显示。LED 显示屏的点距足够小时，色彩足够丰富时其实就形成了我们日常的显示屏，比如 OLED 显示屏其实原理也是类似的。之前报道过的大学宿舍楼通过控制每个房间的灯亮灯灭来形成文字的原理也是一样的。

现在来看看 LED显示文字是怎么回事，比如我们要 显示岛上码农的“岛”字，在16x16的点阵上，通过排布得到的就是下面的结果（不同字体的排布会有些差别）。
因为每一行是16个点，我们可以对应为16位二进制数，把黑色的标记为1，灰色的标记为0，每一行就可以得到一个二进制数。比如上面的第一行第8列为1，其他都是0，对应的二进制数就是0000000100000000，对应的16进制数就是0x0100。把其他行也按这种方式计算出来，最终得到的“岛”字对应的是16个16进制数，如下所示。
 [
   0x0100, 0x0200, 0x1FF0, 0x1010, 
   0x1210, 0x1150, 0x1020, 0x1000,
   0x1FFC, 0x0204, 0x2224, 0x2224,
   0x3FE4, 0x0004, 0x0028, 0x0010
 ];

又了这个基础，我们就可以用 Fl…</span>

However there are some things in RN that do require platform specific code. 
Below we have a custom button component, the effect we&#x27;re looking at now is the button changing color when pressed 👆🏾. 
RN gives us a special property we can use for this effect, it&#x27;s called android_ripple. Once the button is pressed, the ripple property applies the color we provided to the button.

$ sudo apt update

$sudo apt install apache2

Now you need to update the firewall so that your firewall allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic. To check the UFW (uncomplicated firewall) which is a firewall configuration tool that runs on top of iptables, included by default within Ubuntu distributions.

JavaScript has been the only programming language that the browser understands. JavaScript has stood the test of time and it has been able to deliver the performance needed by most web applications. But when it comes to 3D games, VR, AR, and image editing apps, JavaScript is not quite up to the mark since it is interpreted. Although JavaScript engines such as Gecko and V8 have Just in Time compilation capabilities, JavaScript is not able to provide the high performance required by modern web applications.
WebAssembly(also known as wasm) is meant to solve this problem. WebAssembly is a virtual assembly language for the browser. When we say virtual, it means that it cannot be run natively …</span>

                              <span>Technology has grown much faster than everything else. All the technology is developed because of coding and programming.
So what&#x27;s the difference between coding and programming. 
Because computers do not understand human languages. Coding allows humans to communicate with the computer. Code instructs the computer which tasks to be performed and what things to do. Learning code also helps develop applications, websites AI tools and even Internet of Things(IOT) among others.
Coding is a process of establishing a successful communication between a software program and the computer hardware. The compilers translate the program into assembly language. The coding process converts the assembly language to Binary Coded Signals.
Programming is an act of designing and developing a logical software solution to the problem statement. It involves designing and developing the algorithms, flowcharts, and implementing the solution using a programming language.
Programming is a complex task. Unlike coding, programming is carried out in Stages. Following are the stages of programming a software application.
Problem Statement
Designing Algorithms and Flowcharts
Software Development
Software Documentation
Software Maintenance 
Coding uses traditional code/program editing tools like notepad, notepad++, Eclipse, and so on.
Programming tools are not confined to only editing a program. It involves interoperability between different software applications via data connectors. A software web application might have to store and manipulate data in a database and many more.

                              <span>Last week, we created a Xamarin.Forms Barcode QR code scanner for Android and iOS. Xamarin.Forms is not the end for developing cross-platform mobile apps in C#, because .NET MAUI is on the way. Microsoft mentions that .NET MAUI is the evolution of Xamarin.Forms, and it supports both mobile and desktop development. Since .NET MAUI is coming soon, this article will show you how to implement .NET MAUI barcode QR code scanner by porting Xamarin.Forms project.
Although you can refer to Migrating from Xamarin.Forms (Preview), to avoid encountering lots of build errors, it is better to create a new .NET MAUI project and migrate project configuration and code step by step. 
To create a .NET MAUI project, you need to install Visual Studio 2022 Preview beforehand.

In Develop a smart contract, you developed a smart contract for storing and retrieving a single numeric value. This tutorial illustrates how you can extend the functionality of your smart contract to manage one number per user. To add this functionality, you&#x27;ll use the Mapping type.
the following code illustrates mapping a user to a number:
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct MyContract {
    // Store a mapping from AccountIds to a u32
    my_number_map: ink_storage::Mapping,
}

                              <span>Have you ever tried to add an event listener to a group of html elements all at once? if you had, you may had probably done something like this:
const buttons &#x3D; document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;button&quot;);

buttons.forEach((item) &#x3D;&gt; {
  item.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function () {
    console.log(&quot;click&quot;);
  });
});

The problem with the above code is that, when you finally check your browser console, you are going to encounter an error. Why?
This is because we are treating our list of buttons as an array while it is not.
It may look like an array, but it is actually either an htmlCollection or a nodeList. Whenever you make use of methods that fetch multiple elements/nodes from the DOM, that method either returns an htmlCollection or a nodeList.
Methods that returns an htmlCollection include: document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName()
Methods that returns a nodeList include: document.querySelectorAll(), document.getElementsByName()
In order to fix this problem, all you need to do is convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array. This way you can make use of array methods on it, and also add your event listener.
You can use any method you prefer in order to convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array, but my favorite way of converting them into an array, is by making use of the spread operator.
const buttons &#x3D; document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;button&quot;);
const buttonsArray &#x3D; [...buttons];

buttonsArray.forEach((item) &#x3D;&gt; {
  item.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function () {
    console.log(&quot;click&quot;);
  });
});


Now when you go to your browser console, everything will work as it is supposed to.</span>

Recently I found a fun way to play Python, using Python to convert pictures into ASCII image, most of which are local programs, because I built an online version of Python before, so I tried to use the online version of Python to realize image-to-ASCII.
Online Python editor: https://lwebapp.com/en/python-playground
The basic idea of image-to-ASCII painting is
Use PIL to get the RGB color value of each pixel of the image
Then map the RGB color value to a string
Finally, just splicing the strings together, printing to the terminal or saving as text, you can see the ASCII image.
We are here for the convenience of demonstration, and use the print method to print characters uniformly.
Since we want to present on a web page, we can&#x27;t load the image locally, we choose to load the i…</span>

谷歌早期使用的内部 Linux 发行版是基于 Ubuntu LTS 的 Goobuntu。Ubuntu LTS 需要每隔两年更新一次，这对于需要升级几十万台计算机的谷歌来说并非易事。因此谷歌转向了滚动更新发行版，它没有使用著名的滚动更新发行版，如 Arch Linux，而是基于 Debian 测试分支构建了自己的滚动发行版。它将新发行版称为 gLinux Rodete（是 Rolling Debian Testing 的缩写）。Debian 测试分支是滚动更新的。谷歌引入了名为 Sieve 的工作流系统，使用虚拟化测试套装确保软件包新版本不会破坏核心组件和开发者的工作流程。谷歌于 2018 年底完成迁移，次年关闭了剩余的 Goobuntu。

如果一个工具能让事情变得更快、更有效率，那对许多开发者来说就是救命稻草。

虽然有各种服务和平台试图使编码体验更快，但你仍然有其他几个选择可以考虑。

例如，代码片段管理器。使用代码片段管理器，你的目的是保存你想快速访问的代码片段。它更像是指定快捷方式，在你的程序中添加所需的代码。

这不是一个新的概念，但可用于这项工作的工具可能不完全是开源的。

幸运的是，我偶然发现了一个不错的项目，它为你提供了一个自由开源的片段管理器，即 massCode。

massCode：跨平台的开源片段管理器



massCode 是一个有用的代码片段管理器，具有一些基本功能。

它支持广泛的编程语言，还包括对 Markdown 的支持。你可以使用文件夹组织你的代码片段，添加标签等。

massCode 可用于 Linux、Windows 或 macOS。让我们来看看一些主要功能。

massCode 的特点



massCode 包括许多有用的功能。其中一些是：


多层次的文件夹结构

每个片段都可以存储在片段（标签）中

集成的编码编辑器 Ace

代码格式化或高亮显示

支持带预览的 Markdown

能够搜索片段

给你的代码段添加描述，以了解它的用途

各种深色/浅色主题可用

能够从 SnippetsLab 迁移

自动保存以帮助你保留你的工作

将其与云同步文件夹整合

支持 VSCode、Raycast 和 Alfred 的扩展


除了上述所有功能外，你还可以轻松地复制保存代码片段，只需点击一下。

对于自定义，你可以调整字体大小和系列、切换自动换行、高亮显示行、使用单引号或添加尾随命令，这要归功于 Prettier。

此外，一份片段可以有多个分片。因此，它使你有机会将其用于各种用例。

如前所述，你也可以通过改变同步文件夹的存储位置将其与你的任何云同步服务整合。



总的来说，它工作得很好，有一些局限性，比如缺乏将嵌套文件夹从 SnippetsLab 迁移到 masCode 的能力。

在 Linux 上安装 massCode

massCode 有 Snap 包，但不在 Snap 商店中。你可以直接下载该软件包，并使用以下命令来安装它：

sudo snap install --dangerous ~/Downloads/masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap


我们的一份故障排除指南可以帮助你了解 snap 的 dangerous 选项。

你可以通过其 官方网站 或 GitHub 发布区 下载 Windows/MacOS 版。

                              <span>这篇教程演示如何使用脚本命令来发送自己的桌面通知与提醒。




有时候，来自脚本的视觉回馈是很有用的。例如，当一个脚本或计划任务完成时，一个长期运行的构建任务失败时，或者当脚本执行中出现了紧急问题时。桌面应用程序可以通过弹出通知来做到这一点，但脚本也可以做到这一点！你可以使用脚本命令来给自己发送桌面通知与提醒。



下面的代码是在 Linux 上编写和测试的。它也可以在 macOS 上运行，只需花点功夫。请参见最后一节 提示与技巧。

从 Linux 终端发送通知

要从 Linux 终端发送通知，请使用 notify-send 命令。运行 which notify-send 命令来查看它是否在于你的系统中。如果没有，请使用包管理器来安装它。

在 Fedora 上，输入：

$ sudo dnf install notify-send


在基于 Debian 的发行版上，输入：

$ sudo apt install notify-send


几个简单的通知示例：

$ notify-send &quot;Dinner ready!&quot;
$ notify-send &quot;Tip of the Day&quot; &quot;How about a nap?&quot;


你可以用紧急程度、自定义图标等选项来自定义通知。过 man notify-send 了解更多。你也可以在通知正文中使用一小组 HTML 标记，以使消息有一个棒的视觉感受。最重要的是，URL 被呈现为可点击的。例如：

$ notify-send -u critical \
  &quot;Build failed!&quot; \
  &quot;There were 123 errors. Click here to see the results: http://buildserver/latest&quot;

                              <span>二十多年前，我刚刚接触计算机时，那时候觉得编程真是一件神奇的事情，居然可以操作屏幕上神奇的字符！要说我自己的第一个编程“作品”，那可能是试图在 286 PC 的黑白显示器绘制一个钢琴键盘，并可以响应按键发出不同频率的蜂鸣声 —— 是的，那时候还没有声卡，只有开机时会“滴”一下的扬声器。虽然这个简陋的尝试并没有完成，但却给了我极大的乐趣，也开启了我的编程生涯。

从《代码大全》 到 StackOverflow 大师

后来，当我在北京找到第一份工作时，学会了 Perl 语言，编写了我的第一个 CGI 程序（互动网页），编程于是成为了我吃饭的本领。

上世纪末，互联网刚刚在国内兴起，人们编程时所能求助的外援，大多是各种语言手册、类库大全等书籍。这其中有一本著名的大部头被很多程序员置于案头，它就是《代码大全》，这本书里面提供了很多有用的、精妙的编程示例和技巧。往往在遇到编程难点时，程序员们可以“复制”书中的一些最佳实践来解决。



随着互联网的普及，逐渐出现了 Stack Overflow 之类的编程类问答网站。程序员们惊喜的发现，原来很多困扰自己的编程难题都可以在网上找到答案，且点赞数较高的代码示例比自己写的还要好。于是乎，很多“程序员”变成了“谷歌程序员”/“百度程序员”，搜索、复制，然后粘贴就好了。以至于，StackOverflow 在某年愚人节的 恶作剧 说，它将限制对其网站的免费访问，除非人们购买“钥匙”：一个带有“打开 Stack Overflow”、“复制”和“粘贴”的按钮的设备，算是对这种直接复制、粘贴的做法表达了一种冷幽默。最有趣的是，居然有热心网友联合键盘定制厂商，真将这块特别的键盘定制出来了，并以 29 美元出售。



程序员们是否越来越成为一种熟练工？

随着写的代码越来越多，这种有趣但有时候又很枯燥的重复工作，让我想过什么时候可以有个…</span>

@包包呀嘿：糟粕醋火锅底料

购买渠道：淘宝
价格：69 元 3 包

糟粕醋绝对是今年我们家最上头的汤料，特地速速来推荐之！
前阵子在家看 《沸腾吧火锅》 被疯狂种草糟粕醋火锅，边看边咽口水，糟粕醋酸香浓郁的风味还没吃到就已经在我嘴里产生化学反应了，馋得我直咂嘴。
来自《沸腾吧火锅》截图
于是我开始在淘宝上搜索糟粕醋火锅底料，试图制造一些希望短暂缓解我的馋虫，没想到淘宝上还真是什么都有，放眼望去基本上就那么几家，害怕疫情影响快递运力，放弃了看起来最新鲜的瓶装糟粕醋，退而求其次买了袋装的，保质期更长。可以说是激情下单。
大合影
糟粕醋火锅底料里内容非常简单，包括发酵好的醪糟，辣椒酱，还有一包粉包调味料。
包装上写的做法是用 1500ml 水和酒糟包和粉包放进锅里，煮沸后再把辣椒酱倒进去就可以了。开包装小涮了一下，主要以水产为主，搭配一点蔬菜就是很丰盛的一顿周末大餐。
据说糟粕醋最初是因为渔人出海 ，煮了一锅饭准备做酒，但谁知道出海时间太长，回来之后一看米酒发酵过头了，做酒不成，做醋也还不够，扔了又觉得可惜，灵机一动拿来用它煮了一锅刚打捞带回来的海鲜，没想到竟然意外好吃，实属歪打正着了，发酵的汤水和鱼鲜海鲜竟然融合得如此完美，于是糟粕醋就诞生了。
小吃一顿
舀出一口汤小小咂两口，酸味刚好，香气浓郁，一击上头。纪录片里是以涮海鲜为主的，我也就选了水产感受一下它的鲜味。
第一次吃的时候买了盒马鲜切的鱼片，花蛤、虾和鱿鱼须，搭配了牛肉丸、虾滑和青菜蘑菇之类，涮响铃也非常不错。

喜悦
早上，终于收到了 OpenAI 的通知，漫长的排队后，我可以用 DALLE 了。

种草了多长时间？我都快忘了，哈哈。
查了一下，是 4 月 7 日申请的，今天 7 月 13，差不多 100 天吧 😂

激动的心，颤抖的手，赶紧点进去。
欢迎我的，是这样一个霸王条款：

这图片，严禁商用，更别提 NFT 了；而且 OpenAI 对于我创作出来的图片拥有所有权。你只对自己上传到系统的图片有所有权。但是，为了改进模型，人家可能还要用你上传的图片作为训练数据……
搁以前我的脾气，扭头走人。
但是这回不行，吸引力太大，哈哈。
尝试
我输入了这样一段描述文字：

a kung fu panda is fighting with a T-rex in the woods

然后模型开始工作。等候过程中，会有一些提示，帮你改进后续的内容输入方式。
例如这个：

进度条往后走，还有这样的提示：

几十秒钟之后，进度条到头儿。我看到了结果，一共 6 张图片。我一一点进去。
这张很不错：

这张也行：

最搞笑的，是这张：

你拿恐龙当玩具吗？
这是 6 张图片的全景。你更喜欢哪一张呢？

我正玩儿得不亦乐乎，儿子进来了。他刚放假，最近在和弟弟养小鸡。于是他出的题目是：

Two little boys, teasing two fluffy chicks

出来的结果，他不是很满意。

因为这俩小孩儿，明显是外国人嘛。于是我修改了一下描述：

Two little Asian boys, teasing two fluffy chicks

嗯，看起来好多了。

其实，这已经不是我第一次为你介绍人工智能自动绘图工具了。

尝试在 TWRP 里面挂载 OTG U 盘来重刷系统，但是依然无法正常开机。
有想过直接格式化 data ，然后直接线刷，但是手机里的数据还是想保留下来。

使用 fdisk -l /dev/sda 显示，应该是逻辑扇区识别错误的问题。
在 ubuntu 下(x86 电脑)显示的扇区大小为:
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes, 此时能正常识别分区信息。

在 openwrt 下(我家云 arm)显示的扇区大小为:
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes, 此时无法识别分区信息。
在 openwrt 下使用: fdisk -b 512 /dev/sda 进行操作，然后 p 打印分区信息可以显示正常的信息。
应该就是逻辑分区大小的问题了， 这个应该怎么整呢，试过在我家云上格式化硬盘，插回 pc, pc 又识别不了(此时逻辑扇区和物理扇区大小为 4096/4096)</span>

起因，发现右侧车位经常这样停，就让物业通知他改改

然后他就丢纸巾到我们位置（ 2 月一次，我们自己捡起来丢了，其间他又靠边停，无视之，最近不知何故又丢）

于是再次找物业，说约出来聊聊吧，结果人家说在自己车位（他租的非小区人买的小区车位）不犯法（类似这个说法），要找去找警察。三天，物业无法解决
左侧司机位这样停不是给自己找麻烦么？黑人问号脸

如图所示，阿里云，同一代（ g7)同样规格的服务器，AMD 比 Intel 要便宜 10-20%。
在只跑一些 x64 架构下的应用，比如 nginx ，数据库，Web 应用。用 AMD 的会有什么坑吗，比如稳定性，CPU 性能差距，IO 差距啥的？
本人用的就是 AMD CPU 的笔记本，个人用起来当然不会有啥问题。但如果是服务器场景下肯定不能按照个人 PC 的思路来考虑。</span>

在 Java 语言中字段是无法重载的，两个字段的数据类型、修饰符不管是否相同，都必须使用不一样的名称，但是对于 Class 文件格式来讲，只要两个字段的描述符不是完全相同，那字段重名就是合法的。
弄不懂这是什么意思。为什么说 Class 文件格式里面可以字段重名？
如果 Java 语言本身不支持字段重名，那么 Java 文件编译出来的 Class 文件里面怎么可能有重名的字段呢？</span>

副卡改 0 元的业务，不接 2i 套餐，沃家副，136 政企、折扣政企副.大家去自己的本地和附近联通营业厅。直接大部分可以改的，
只要不是上面这些套餐。幸福家家乐先透露一下四川 59 的可以改 0 元副卡。去联通自营的营业厅权限基本可以。
副卡改 0 系统里面开放两个月了，联通营业厅如果确实帮你找不到可以改 0 元副卡。请打工人别为难打工人

如题，和朋友一起打算折腾一个新项目，想名字已经想破脑袋了，故希望 v 友一起集思广益。
目前确定的产品类型是护肤类产品，帮助用户了解自己的皮肤状况，以及选择合适的护肤品。
如果您的建议被采纳或我从中得到灵感，我会给你一个小小的红包以示感谢 (200 元)。
大致要求如下:
希望整体感觉是偏中性化的 (因为目标用户内也会有男性，过于女性化的名字可能会造成第一印象的偏移)
希望可以便于记忆 or 顺口 (例如小红书，微信)
能和护肤产生一定的联想 (非强求。PS: 非美妆。例如 小白瓶 这种名称，由于大多数精华都是小瓶子的形式，所以可以自然的产生一定的联想)。
目前自己想出来的名称如下:
空瓶集 (这个名称是最喜欢的，顺口，且能产生一定联想，但是奈何已经被注册掉了)
30 毫升 (30ML ，精华液大多数会采用的容量，但是总感觉这个名称不太好)</span>

是这样的，我现在主力机已经转到 Linux 了，但是由于国内软件生态问题，偶尔还是不得不切回 Windows 。在 Linux 上尝试了一些虚拟机软件之后，发现体验都不理想，思来想去最后还是我入手了一个 Surface Go3 。之所以选择这一款，主要是因为它是目前市面上最小巧的 Windows 平板，而且是微软官方出品，质量信得过。
使用了几个月之后，我不得不说，Windows 平板才是真正的生产力工具。为什么呢，因为它的触屏体验实在太残废了。而正是因为这种残废，削弱了平板的娱乐属性，反而增强的它的办公属性。你不会像 iPad 那样整体抱着它滑来滑去，要么是刷剧要么是打游戏，你唯一能做的就是把它当作一个 PC 来使用，偶尔用触屏作为辅助功能。
我平时用这个平板聊天或者开视频会议都没什么大问题，然而一旦网页稍微多一点就很吃力了，这点比较难受，虽说 8G 的内存也够了，但毕竟用是奔腾处理器。
然后我看了下市面上的其他 Windows 平板，发现还说得过去的只剩下这三款：
Surface Pro —— 性价比太低了，而且太大
联想 YOGA Duet —— 还是太大太厚重了
华为 MateBook E —— 配置和大小可以，然而那个设计风格模仿 iPad 痕迹太重了，尤其是那个圆角屏幕，我看着真是太难受了，跟 Windows 本身的硬朗风格非常不搭，有种很撕裂的感觉
由此我还是希望厂商们多多投入 Windows 平板领域，让市场上有更多选择，这块前景还是不错的。虽说智能手机和 iPad 这类偏生活和娱乐的工具受众更高，但是市场也饱和的差不多了，办公和生产力这方面还是很值得继续探索的。</span>

最近用 tailwindCSS 些样式, 但是发现 tailwind 只是个 css 库, 没有组件库. 
我需要 pigination 组件(带 JS 的那种), 我非得单独安装个非 tailwindCSS 的组件吗? 
请问哪里能下载到 tailwindCSS 的组件库(带 js 的那种).  或者支持 tailwindCSS 的 z 组件也可以. 
哎, 我一个女程序员啥都不懂, 请指教 谢谢.</span>

房子情况介绍
1.房子位于中部省会旁边的市里，类似于北京和燕郊的关系，只不过有合并的可能
2.19 年购买，今年 7 月拿到的契税发票(满 2 时间的依据)，目前已经降价 10w 左右
3.我未来大概率(80%)以上不会居住，家人在同一个市里有其他房产
顾虑
1.如果现在卖，税费比较高，但是再放两年，多出的贷款利息也差不多是那个钱
2.个人是觉得应该卖，这几年深刻意识到口罩时期，现金流才是王道，但是家人不同意，觉得赔 20w(房价降幅+贷款利息)很难接受，我应该怎么说服家里人</span>

API 管理这个话题近些年听到的频次越来越多，这本质上是个 web 领域的发展有关，也和开发协作方式有关--前后端分离代替了全栈工程师 hold all 的局面，强调的更多的是 API 复用、分工和协作细化。
API 管理的重要性不言而喻，每家公司随着业务的发展，多多少少都会涉及到；从开源社区的产品到国内各类商业化产品，可以看到大家对于 API 管理是越来越重视的。
为什么需要管理 API
Little story
结合自身的开发经历，我们先讨论下，为什么需要管理 API
1 、在实习的时候是在一家小的游戏公司，人不多，一个产品；当时技术经理的安排是一个后端+一个前端的组合开发，大家都在一个办公室，接口 API 交付依赖的是“讲一声”；这种形式减少了接口定义、审核以及一些文档的编写，面向指定接口的一对一交付；其实这个过程很顺利，还可以培养同事之间的关系；直到有一天，我对接的前端同事离职了，来了一个新的伙伴，然后我们也刚好要产品升级；每当我改一个接口，前端同学或者测试同学就说，接口不行了。后来我也走了，换了新的后端，“口口相传” API 就断代了。

2 、第二个 case 是做一个 web 项目(应用元数据管理)，前后端分离的；我们是先定义有哪些接口，然后再定义参数、返回结果以及这个字段的含义；是面向文档交付的；每个接口开发完之后发布到测试环境，然后他去编写前端接口调用测试；这种耦合度非常高，前端的节奏受制于后端的节奏。

3 、前面两种面向的都是一个端，再到后来，开始做基础平台，面向的有 web 、app （安卓、IOS ），各种三方，我们使用了开源社区的 Yapi 做了私有化部署，能够基本满足日常的需求（也比较痛苦，后面会提到）。

API 管理带来的好处
从前一节的 case 来看，API 管理的过程是在逐步完善的，从以工程师视角管理到更规范化的…</span>

There are many theories about why the C programming language has endured for as long as it has. Maybe it&#x27;s the austerity of its syntax or the simplicity of its vocabulary. Or maybe it&#x27;s that C is often seen as a utilitarian language, something that&#x27;s rugged and ready to be used as a building material for something that needs no platform because it&#x27;s going to be its own foundation. C is clearly a powerful language, and I think its longevity has a little something to do with the way it serves as a springboard for other popular technologies. Here are five of my favorite technologies that utilize and rely upon C, and how they can each help you learn more about C…</span>

The solo exhibition on view at Unit London showcases vivid paintings by Belgian artist Kristof Santy that transform humble fare like a cheddar wedge or slice of watermelon into bright, gastronomic celebrations.
Often positioned against textured tile backdrops or striped wallpaper, the oil-based works tend to be either devoid of human life or portray figures in rigid stasis: a butcher stiffly lifts a broom in the shop doorway, a finger peels back a tin of fish with precision, and pans filled with sausages and other meats fry on a stovetop unsupervised.

A professional pet portraitist, Vogelsang mostly visits her subjects at their homes rather than bringing them to her Hildesheim studio. More</span>

在平时的开发中，我们不免会遇到跨进程的通信，平时使用系统提供的诸如ActivityServiceManager这些系统服务，其实就是使用了跨进程的调用，那么跨进程的调用，需要解决的就是进程间的通信问题，Android系统为我们提供了Binder机制，利用Binder机制，我们可以自由地实现进程间的通信，下面我们一起看看Binder机制的相关原理。
正文
认识Binder
首先，我们先认识一下Binder是什么，有什么作用，相比其他的进程间通信方式有什么优点。
1.Binder是什么
Binder是一种进程间通信的机制，在Android系统中，进程间的通信，它们的底层基本都是用到了Binder的IPC机制，比如我们进程1的Activity要使用进程2中Service的某个能力，则需要用到Binder机制来进行进程间的通信，包括平时我们使用的系统提供的一些Service如AMS、IMS等等，都是用到了Binder在底层作为支撑。
2.Binder的优势
我们知道在系统中其实有很多种IPC的方式，如Socket、消息队列和内存共享等，Android还提供了Binder机制，相信会有其独特的优点：
性能：在移动设备上，由于性能受到各方面的限制，例如电量，所以在使用进程间通信时，需要对性能这块有很大的要求。Socket、消息队列这些，在进程间通信时，数据拷贝需要两次，而内存共享只需拷贝无需拷贝，但实现起来比较复杂。Binder在数据上拷贝只需一次，它通过内存映射的机制实现了一次数据拷贝。
安全：传统的IPC，UID/PID只能由用户在数据包填入，这样会导致接收方无法获取到可靠UID/PID，而且还会存在被恶意程序利用的可能。Binder机制中可靠的身份标志只能在IPC机制的内核中添加的，它从协议本身就支持对通信双方进行身份校验，大大提高了安全性。
稳定：Binder基于C/S架…</span>

0. 前言
可能有人会觉得，画箭头有什么好说的，不就一根线加两个头吗？其实箭头的绘制还是比较复杂的，其中也蕴含着很多绘制的小技巧。箭头本身有着很强的 示意功能 ,通常用于指示、标注、连接。各种不同的箭头端，再加上线型的不同，可以组合成一些固定连接语法，比如 UML 中的类图。

一个箭头，其核心数据是两个点的坐标，由 左右端点 和 线型 构成。这篇文章就来探索一下，如何绘制一个支持各种样式，而且容易拓展的箭头。

1. 箭头部位的划分
首先要说一点，我希望获取的是箭头的 路径 ，而非单纯的绘制箭头。因为有了路径，可以做更多的事，比如根据路径裁剪、沿路径运动、多个路径间的合并操作等。当然，路径形成之后，绘制自然是非常简单的。所以在绘制技巧中，路径一个非常重要的话题。

代码实现如下，测试使用的起始点分别是 (40,40) 和 (200,40)，圆形路径以起始点为中心，宽高为 10。可以看出虽然实现了需求，但是都写在一块，代码看起来比较乱。当要涉及生成各种样式箭头时，在这里修改代码也是非常麻烦的，接下来要做的就是对箭头的路径形成过程进行抽象。

Offset p0 &#x3D; Offset(40, 40);
Offset p1 &#x3D; Offset(200, 40);

Rect startZone &#x3D; Rect.fromCenter(center: p0, width: width, height: height);

自健康码诞生以来，其使用体验就一直饱受诟病。其中最突出的便是：缓慢的启动速度，繁琐重复的多步操作。
于是我们就开始寻求各种方案。目前的“门派”有：iOS 捷径，URL Scheme ，利用 Accessibility ，截图，自行开发模仿界面（由此还引发了 2021 年 1 月的“健康码演示”事件）。
但从此刻开始，我不再愿意浪费我宝贵的时间，为无能的政腐“擦屁股”。提升健康码启动速度和便利性，避免公共场所核验导致的拥堵等种种问题，这是我的职责么？
又凭什么要求我一手拉着行李箱，另一手单手操作，提前打开两个健康码和一个行程码？我摔倒的风险，摔坏手机的风险，谁人承担？
我也曾多次埋怨他们没能提前打开健康码，嘲笑他们打开应用时因卡顿而焦躁的模样，为我的“聪明才智”而沾沾自喜。
但从此刻开始，我将移除我的设备上的所有此类改良措施；在动车站，我要等到了队伍前头，才放下手中的大包小包，从容地拿出手机，一步一步打开各种“码”。
站台上的工作人员呵斥我，一旁的同学指责我，后排西装革履的白领辱骂我，一如我从前的模样。但他们又能如何？
这是“躺平”么？是，也不是。幻想一下，如果人人都和我一样，那么此类情形发生的地方将完全地从“流水线”退化为串行，也许暴增的拥堵，交通的瘫痪，会唤醒一些什么。</span>

使用 WebStorm 创建 Vue 项目如果勾选 “Use the default project setup (babel,eslint) ”那么 vue-cli 默认创建的就是 Vue3 项目，可以修改默认创建版本吗？ 当然这个可以取消这个勾选然后创建的时候手动选择，但是我想应该是有配置或者是方式可以修改默认创建版本的。
每次创建一个新的项目都会在项目目录中新生成 node_modules 一个目录然后去下载相应的包，总之感觉这样操作很浪费时间和占用空间，很不合理，不知道是不是我没有配置或者是使用错误的原因，能不能像 java 的 maven 那种包管理方式，同样的包下载一次有依赖的项目直接引用就可以了。npm 好像可以使用 -g 参数全局安装一些包，这个能解决问题吗，其实就算能解决这个问题感觉涉及也不合理
Vue.js devtools 在很多资料中都说 Vue2 和 Vue3 要使用不同的插件 Vue3 要使用带 beta 字样的那个版本， 但是我实际使用过程中 就用普通的 Vue2 的新版本 devtools 插件一点也没有发现问题啊，反而使用 beta 字样版本的很多时候卡和无法使用, 这个问题到底是 Vue2 新版本插件增加了对 Vue3 的支持还是什么原因
npm build 的两个问题：1 ）有详细的资料介绍 打包后 CDN 优化的资料吗，网上看过一些感觉写的都不详细，2 ）打包的时候命名规则能自定义吗，我经常看到打包后的 js css 和一些样式的名字都要带一串数字  感觉很 low

service 是被 systemd 启动的，可是在 servrice 进入 loop 的时候，被 /lib/systemd/systemd kill 了。我为什么知道是被 systemd kill 了呢？因为我用 strace 命令追踪了它的系统调用。发现它向 service 发送了 SIGTERM 信号。如果用 systemctl start 重启，又会被杀。可是我如果手动键入命令行重启，就正常了。
老实说，以前只是粗浅了解过 systemd. 难道 systemd 发现了什么异常情况然后想杀掉 service?比如内存使用过多？因为我看启动 log 提示代码中有 calloc()函数分配失败的情况。不过由于代码过于庞大，目前还没有找到是哪里调用的 calloc （） 。网上搜索了一下，发现 systemd 限制内存似乎要看 /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/。可是我系统上连 /sys/fs/cgroup/memory 都不存在。</span>

一个逻辑问题，求知道的告知下，情况是这样的。某文件夹下有 N 段视频，这里随便举个例子，比如 10 段
分别为视频 1.mp4   2.mp4   3.mp4 以此类推到 10.mp4.
视频时长不等。
想做到 
需求 1
自动检测这 N 段视频，并按照时长 8 秒分割这些视频，最后剩余的如果小于于 6 秒则删除，分割后建立对应视频名称的文件夹并写入。
需求 2
抽取这些文件夹里面的 8 秒片段视频，每个文件夹仅抽取一段，10 个文件夹的话就是 10 段，合成一个视频，并记录合成视频采用片段的前后排序关系。完成后继续合成，并读取该文件，确保再次合成的视频顺序不和前面生成的视频有相同之处。这样的话其实应该有很多种可能
写的有点乱，大概通俗的说，我要生成的视频每小段均取自分别的 8 秒视频片段，但是排序不同有很多可能。不知道怎么表达？我凌乱了。
或者给我几个关键词。我研究研究。</span>

入 aws 之前，一直在注册甲骨文，一直失败，突然明白一件事：免费的东西才是最贵的！注册甲骨文真是个体力活，浪费时间，浪费精力。
ps ，能用钱解决的问题都不是问题，花点钱，获得更好的服务。

# 5 分钟发布一次总流量到 public mqtt broker ，在本地订阅。

分析原因如下：
1.lightsail 流量双向计算，平均下来，每天 30g ，一个人使用都不够！就这一条，足以吓退一堆搞机场，挂 pt ，跑码，搞黑产的，这些都是流量大户，肯定吃不开！
2.aws 使用后计费的弹性计费模式，不认真看文档，乱点击，被收费的机率很大。
注意事项：
日常使用，不要开 icmp （ ping ），避免 icmp 类的 ddos 攻击。本地检测延时用 tcping 443 端口。</span>

很多人有在冰箱上贴便签或待办事项的习惯
如果 kindle 带个磁吸壳，就可以吸附在冰箱上
然后用浏览器查看在线日历和待办事项
优势：
1 、墨水屏，只在刷新的时候耗电，所以一次充电能用很久
2 、可以远程添加日历和待办事项，家庭使用的话，也可以订阅家人的日历，做到所有人的日历和事项都在一个页面解决
未解决的问题：
1 、无法做到主动刷新，例如有新日历或新事项推送时主动刷新
2 、目前没有日历和待办事项共存一个页面的 web ，日历可以基于服务商订阅，但是待办事项好像没有
3 、旧款的 kindle 屏幕还是太小了点</span>

结果我去京东找了一圈，5L 的油没有一个低于 60 的，之前经常买的一级菜也直接翻倍了，另一个买的纯香也涨了二十多，真的是不当家不知柴米油盐贵啊。</span>

1 、工作职责：
Modern AI algorithms pose a hard barrier between training and inference. This necessitates separate infrastructures for each of training and inference, which doubles the cost. Such a separate system design gets increasingly tough to be managed efficiently when the algorithm scales out to thousands or more GPUs. To tackle this issue, this project pursues both algorithmic and systematic advances on continual learning by leveraging mixture-of-experts architecture in large-scale AI models. The intern will be supervised by both system experts in Networking Research Group and algorithm experts in CV Research Group.
2 、职位要求：
1. Investigate state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms for large-scale AI models
2. Develop novel algorithms to improve the continual learning performance by leveraging the mixture-of-experts architecture
3. Contribute to efficient system development by leveraging proposed algorithms
3 、具有以下条件者优先：
1. Experience in deep learning research regarding to this project
2. Fluent communication in English

                              <span>huntagain2008: 这是 2012 年我给老妈发的邮件，标题是“大众笔记本的选择”，真想抽过去的自己。
有这样一种观点：
      联想收购了 IBM 之后得到很多新技术，在散热、硬盘保护上都有独到之处，电池非常耐用（可以待机 5-6 小时没问题），因此 5000 元以内很多都推荐联想 THINKPAD 。
 5000 元的本本有什么处理器以及显卡？
       多数持这样一种观点：i5-2450M 2G 320G 1G 独显
       i5 二代的处理器，2G 内存（可以拓展到 4G ），320G 硬盘，1G 独立显卡
 THINKPAD E420 这个系列是学生机，办公不适合？
       有些阐述了这种观点。
       他们多数推荐 X 系列。不过，价格 6000 以上。
       联想 ThinkPad X121e （ 30456AC ） 11.6 英寸 采用 Intel 酷睿 i3 2357M NVIDIA Quadro NVS 3000M 320GB 2GB ￥ 4550
       这款仅 4550 ，不过处理器是 I3 的，配置较 14 寸的笔记本就低了一些
  
比较客观的说法：
     目前在 5000 区域以内 配制普遍 CPU 都是 2 代 i5 ，显卡 1G 独显 A 卡或者 N 卡，设计推荐用 A 卡，N 卡是适合玩游戏，两者差别不大游戏也是一样，但是 A 卡的画质处理性能比 N 卡强的不是一般的高，所以推荐用 A 卡。（这里的 A 卡，指的应该是 AMD 的显卡芯片,玩游戏似乎都是用 N 卡的多)
      因此，到底买什么型号可以这样界定：
     1.联想 THINKPAD
     2.CPU I5 显卡 A 卡
     3.若能 X 系列更好，原因比较轻便，外观出去更有面子，不过价格不好取舍</span>

def newMission(data):
    print(data)


sio.connect(&#x27;ws://localhost:8090&#x27;)
sio.wait()

预计是打算让服务端获取客户端的 sid ，然后通过 sid 推送消息，但是不知道为什么客户端死活无法收到消息，查了很久也不知道哪里写错了，求助万能的 v 友</span>

                              <span>For many companies, performance is the main reason to go with GraphQL. But is that a valid argument? Often developers compare GraphQL to REST APIs and see the N+1 requests (or over-fetching) as an important reason to go for GraphQL. Let&#x27;s put that to the test and explore if GraphQL APIs actually can outperform existing REST APIs. For this, we&#x27;ll take a GraphQL-ized REST API and test the performance of GraphQL and compare it to the REST approach. For this we&#x27;ll be using the popular performance testing tool k6.
Before exploring a GraphQL API, let&#x27;s learn more about the technology. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, designed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012 to handle API requests on low bandwidth networks. After being used internally, GraphQL was open-sourced in 2015. Since 2019 its trademar…</span>

                              <span>When working with a GitHub repository, you&#x27;ll often need to identify yourself to GitHub using your username and password. An SSH key is an alternate way to identify yourself that doesn&#x27;t require you to enter you username and password every time. To add such key, you need to generate it on your PC. To generate and add it to GitHub, you need to follow following steps,
The SSH key can be generated using ssh-keygen command using git bash as below,
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;

replace your_email@example.com with your actual email address.
By default, the SSH key will be stored in the home directory. Now, you need to copy the public key. The public key can be seen using cat command as below,
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the public key from terminal. The final step is to add it to the GitHub. 

To add it, go to your GitHub profile settings &gt; SSH and GPG keys &gt; new SSH key, add title for your key and paste the public key in Key box.

                              <span>The world of DevOps has given so many opportunities for software organizations. Software development best practices have given rise to many platforms and tools to deploy software quickly and easily. Kubernetes and Helm can do so much together in helping developers deploy software with less effort. Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for running container-based apps in the enterprise. In fact, organizations aim at running all their production deployments on Kubernetes. 
These are exciting times for those in the Kubernetes community because we’re seeing more and more users leverage its extended capabilities for even deeper operational insight and control. One such capability is the use of Helm to package and deploy individual Kubernetes applications.

                              <span>If you’re familiar with Flutter, you’re definitely familiar with FutureBuilder. After all this is the only way you can fetch data in Flutter with proper state, or is it? But you might’ve noticed every time the Widget gets rebuild the Future is run along too unless you declare your Future in initState
But even if you declare your future in initState to avoid reruns across rebuilds it will still rerun when the Widget gets disposed &amp; mounted again. So what’s the solution? Ans: FutureProvider from riverpod or provider
Hold on a sec, but it’s not another riverpod/provider article? No, it&#x27;s not.
Yeah, to cache your future results or server response in you can use FutureProvider. It can store &amp; distribute the result all across the application without multiple reruns of the same operation. But wha…</span>

                              <span>A new feature has emerged in your favorite software testing solution! The graphic recognition of elements of your applications (web, mobile, desktop) to make comparisons of graphic elements with each other.
Until now, detections and comparisons of application elements required capturing an element and its text attributes. To do this, you used the capture tool of Agilitest which allowed you to dig into the tree structure of your application and its data logic.
Now, this capture tool has been expanded with a graphical capture possibility which &quot;photographs&quot; a small area of ​​the application in order to detect its occurrence during a test, once or several times.
To use the graphics recognition functionality, simply open the Agilitest capture tool and select a rectangular area. The blue selection rectangle allows you to choose the area to be captured, for later detection during a test.
Selection of a graphic area in Agilitest
Once the image is selected, Agilitest allows you to copy or save the image for external use, but you can also drop the image directly in an Agilitest comment or access the tree of elements to generate an activatable zone...

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool. Being an Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool, it streamlines the authentication process for applications and IT services.
The purpose of an IAM tool is to ensure that the right people in a company have appropriate access to resources. It usually enables the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO), identity federation, and strong authentication.
It is becoming a more and more critical topic daily to secure applications. Not only that, but it can potentially cost millions of dollars in the form of various financial penalties for unauthorized access to protected data. To manage the users’ identities and accesses, all the applications need som…</span>

                              <span>This series explores how we can keep our code declarative as we adapt our features to progressively higher levels of complexity.
Sometimes multiple stores need to react to a single DOM event. Let&#x27;s say we have a button in our template that sets all colors in all stores to black. If it weren&#x27;t for Rule 2, we might write a click handler like this:
  setAllToBlack() {
    // &#x60;set&#x60; is a state change that should come by default with every adapter
    this.favoriteStore.set([&#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;]);
    this.dislikedStore.set([&#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;]);
    this.neutralStore.set([&#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;]);
}

But this would log 3 &quot;events&quot; in Devtools back-to-back. Not to mention the total number of imperative statements is 4 now, instead of just the 1 from the template.

Looks like a lot of devs are already on vacation 😎. On my side I will also skip some editions this summer to rest.
This week, we have a good variety of React and React-Native content. A lot of very positive feedback from the community on Bun!
On my side, Docusaurus 2.0 should be released soon, after 4 years of alpha/beta. I hope you will help me to make the launch a success! I&#x27;m thinking of sending you a different email for the occasion, to better present this tool I&#x27;m working on for Facebook.

The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when the programmer needs to execute a block of code several times. For this purpose, The programming languages provide various kinds of loops that are able to repeat some particular code numerous numbers of times. Here, we are going to talk about looping statements in Python.
In a programming language, a looping statement contains instructions that continually repeat until a certain condition is reached. Read on to find out more about them.

TikTok is starting to offer users a new level of control over their For You page. The company announced today that you’ll be able to specify specific words or hashtags you don’t want to see in your feeds, and the app will automatically filter them out. TikTok’s examples are fairly simple — like when you’ve finished a reno and don’t want to see DIY videos anymore or decide you don’t want to see cooking tutorials using a certain type of food or meat. But these kinds of filters could be used to much more carefully control your feed.
The platform is also rolling out two new automated moderation and filtering tools. One, called Content Levels, ranks content based on “thematic maturity” and is designed to keep mature content of all types from...

Welcome to our repository of only the best Amazon Prime Day 2022 deals for Prime members. What will you find in here? You’ll find big discounts on tech products that we actually like, and other Verge-y stuff that we feel comfortable recommending based on specs and price. What you won’t find are bad, also-ran deals that appear at several other times of the year. You don’t have time for that, and we don’t have time for that, either. That criteria means we’re trying to keep the list trim to make it easier to peruse.
If you aren’t ready to shop Prime Day 2022 deals today, fret not, as many of them should last through Wednesday, July 13. And we’ll be updating this post throughout the big sale event, with the freshest and best deals occupying...

We’re in the midst of Amazon Prime Day, and yet some of the best Prime Day deals to be had aren’t on Amazon’s site at all. While Best Buy is calling its sales “Black Friday in July” — which makes even less sense than calling a two-day event Prime Day, singular — Walmart is running deals of its own. It’s commonplace to see Walmart and the others matching many of the deals Amazon throws out there, as well as promoting some unique ones of its own. 
Some of these deals can be a little unexpected and especially good, while some are just what we’d call a fine discount on any other day of the year. However, if you happen to be a Walmart Plus subscriber, there may be added incentive to find these deals at your retailer of choice, like taking...

Amazon Prime Day is the second-best time of year to bag some smart home gadgets at excellent prices. While Black Friday and its various offshoots traditionally have deeper discounts and wider product options, Prime Day feels strategically situated on the calendar as an ideal buying season for those invested in the smart home. This is particularly true if you are looking for some bargains on Amazon Alexa devices or compatible gadgets.
This year, there are some good deals to be found for Prime members this July 12th and 13th on everything from smart thermostats and smart locks to security cameras and smart lighting. Plus, it’s a great time to stock up on a couple more Echo speakers if there’s a room in your house that still doesn’t have...

Prime Day is an excellent opportunity to save big on those new headphones or earbuds you’ve been eyeing. Amazon is offering substantial savings and discounts on many well-reviewed sets from brands including Sony, Bose, Samsung, Beats, and more. Many of our favorite recommendations are on sale.

If you’re a savvy tech shopper, you can set your watch to the annual cadence of TV deals. There are the big ones, like Black Friday and the Super Bowl, and then smatterings around and in-between with Memorial Day, Labor Day, and some others. Amazon Prime Day has become another notable TV shopping holiday, with its somewhat annual cadence and occasional date changes starting back in 2015. With Prime Day 2022 kicking off, it’s another great chance to get a new 4K TV or upgrade your existing one for something better, faster, and maybe even bigger.
Among all the Prime Day deals we’re covering here at The Verge (smart home tech, earbuds, phones, laptops, and much more), this is one of the biggest. There are TVs with OLED and Mini LED panels...

This year’s Amazon Prime Day is delivering a ton of great deals, but some of the best — naturally — are on Amazon’s own products. So if you’ve been eyeing the newest Kindle or one of the many Alexa-powered smart displays, now is a good time to make the leap.
Below, we’ve listed the best Prime Day discounts available on Amazon devices, from e-readers and smart speakers to TVs, home security systems, and even Wi-Fi routers. Also, if you’re looking for deals on non-Amazon goods, be sure to check out our massive list of the best Prime Day deals happening right now.

Amazon Prime Day is finally upon us, and with it comes a variety of excellent deals on gaming hardware and accessories, not to mention games. This year, you can even grab some cool odds and ends to round out your gaming setup at home, whether you’re looking to personalize your peripherals or elevate the production of your Twitch stream.
While it’s still a bit ambitious to expect discounts on next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, we’re definitely keeping our ears to the ground for restocks of the console at Amazon and other retailers.

We can wholeheartedly recommend picking the Meta Quest 2 for its ease of use and accessibility, but Amazon has also discounted the HTC Vive...

如果你想知道谈话类节目、室外采访、环境音or白噪音、直播、读书类节目，以及「不在场 」这样包含音乐弹奏类的节目是通过哪些设备录制的，绝对不能错过本期推送。
强烈建议收藏本文！！
 

 
经过对许多播客创作者的咨询，我们发现播客机构对于设备的选择比较类似，使用最广泛的设备是罗德Caster Pro+Podmic，和Zoom+舒尔 SM58麦克风。但由于节目形态、预算、录制形式、声音条件等方面的要求，很多创作者选择了其他设备，我们来看看大家是怎么说的。
（类目内按信息回复时间前后排序）
谈话类
 

 
播客公社（超级游文化，特费神，体坛站着侃，呆萌刺猬等）：
 
设备为RODE Caster Pro+PodMic，这是非移动录制需求环境下比较合适的设备，专门针对播客创作者设计，自带的算法让声音不会爆，还自带主动降噪功能。 
 

 
 

 
日谈公园：
 
设备为Zoom录音机（H6）+动圈麦克风（灵敏度低，SM58），如果有外出录音需要用小蜜蜂，推荐罗德 Wireless go二代
 

 
 

小黄鱼播客网络（博物志、bibiEdit、蒙台啥利、哈利播客等）：
 
Zoom H5+舒尔SM58（ 蒙台啥利：森海塞尔XS1），指向型动圈麦适用于不完美的录音环境，比如在家的时候，因为只会收到离麦克风比较近的声音。
舒尔的这款麦克风非常经典，但大家如果是闲鱼上购入，需要注意可能会碰到假货。

大内密谈：
 
录制设备：Zoom LiveTrak L-8（录音棚）、Zoom H5（外出）
麦克风：Shure SM58

                              <span>原则
在之前的一篇文章《做一个不完美的完美主义者——从「整理」开始》（下称《整理》）里， 我介绍了关于整理的一些原则和工具。有朋友留言说希望能够介绍一下这些方法的 workflow，即如何把这些方法落地到日常中的。
我决定套一下娃，用我是如何写作《整理》这篇文章作为一个例子，来讲讲我是如何在自己的项目中使用这些方法原则的。
首先我们来迅速回顾一下《整理》中提到的原则：
好记性不如烂笔头：记录下所有的想法，不管是大是小
珍惜有限的注意力：通过把所有的想法都记录在工具里，把自己有限的注意力放在正在做的事情上
二八原则（帕累托原则）：把重要的时间首先放在重要的内容上
敏捷思维：小步快跑，迭代并联处理问题，而非使用串联的思维
笔记也有「hierarchy」：把笔记分类，不同类的笔记用不同的方法、工具处理
把时间作为必不可少的朋友：在记录笔记时，尽量加入时间的维度
写作的故事
我产生写作《整理》这篇文章的契机，其实是在我一次写日记的时候。
在我之前的一篇关于写日记的文章里，我建议在写日记的时候准备一张白纸在一旁，把大脑里有趣的、碎片的想法用一些关键词记录下来，有的之后可以在日记里覆盖，有的可以放到别的地方，以后再展开。
在某次写日记时，我的思绪回到了我申请硕士的时候。当时我找朋友填写一个问卷，讲讲她们对我的看法，其中有一个朋友说我非常井井有条、把项目文件整理得很好。
当时我就转念一想，那么为什么不把自己关于整理的方法整理一下呢？这既可以帮助我自己整理思绪，也可以分享给需要的朋友。于是，我抓起旁边的白纸，在上面写下了这样一些关键词：
写作时的小纸条
写下这些碎片，应该是在去年年底的事情了。在那之后生活里发生了很多事情，这篇文章的优先级也总是被别的文章挤下去。但是这张纸条我一直夹在日记本里。
今年年初的时候我开始用 Notion，专门建了一个写作的文件夹，里边放了许多我想写的话题。

Open source is one of the most important technology trends of our time. It’s the lifeblood of the digital economy and the preeminent way that software-based innovation happens today. In fact, it’s estimated that over 90% of software released today contains open source libraries.
There&#x27;s no doubt the open source model is effective and impactful. But is there still room for improvement? When comparing the broader software industry’s processes to that of open source communities, one big gap stands out: productivity management.
By and large, open source project leads and maintainers have been slow to adopt modern productivity and project management …</span>

I recently wrote a C program in Linux to create a smaller random selection of MP3 files from my extensive MP3 library. The program goes through a directory containing my MP3 library, and then creates a directory with a random, smaller selection of songs. I then copy the MP3 files to my smartphone to listen to them on the go.
Sweden is a sparsely populated country with many rural areas where you don&#x27;t have full cell phone coverage. That&#x27;s one reason for having MP3 files on a smartphone. Another reason is that I don&#x27;t always have the money for a streaming service, so I like to have my own copies of the songs I enjoy.

                              <span>微软仍计划默认屏蔽下载的 Office 文件中的宏

多年来，黑客们经常用恶意的宏来攻击 Office 文件。微软原本计划要求 Office 用户在打开从互联网下载的 Office 文件时，通过在文件属性中专门勾选一个解禁选项来启用宏程序。之前计划在 6 月份实施。但微软在 6 月 30 日突然撤销了这一阻止。微软解释称，“根据用户的反馈，我们暂时回退了这一变化，同时我们做了一些额外的改变以提高可用性。”目前，Office 用户可以简单地在文件顶部的横幅上点击一个启用按钮。微软称，“这是一个临时的变化，我们完全致力于为所有用户进行默认的改变。”

老王点评：宏给 Office 带来的好处不如它带来的问题更多，这一举措确实有助于微软提供更好的产品体验。




PyPI 将向关键项目赠送 4000 个安全密钥

PyPI 由 Python 软件基金会（PSF）管理，是 Python 开发人员获得第三方开发的开源包的主要仓库。这些库的安全影响到了整个 Python 生态的安全，PSF 现在强制要求“关键项目”的开发人员在未来几个月内使用双因素认证（2FA），这使得开发人员可以保护自己难于盗取凭证。任何在过去六个月里下载量排名前 1% 的项目将被视作关键项目，有超过 3800 个项目被评为“关键”，这涉及到 8241 个 PyPI 用户。作为 PSF 的赞助商，谷歌开源安全团队提供了 4000 个谷歌泰坦安全密钥，以分发给这些维护者。PyPI 数据显示，目前有 28336 个用户启用了 2FA，其中近 27000 个用户使用的是像“微软验证器”这样的 2FA 应用。

老王点评：虽然 2FA 密钥不能完全避免被盗取凭证，但是却可提供大部分保护。




美国企业领导人敦促加强计算机科学教育

超过 500 名美国的商业、教育和非营利组织领导人发表了一封公开信，呼吁美国各州政府和教育负责人为全美的 K-12 学生提供更多的计算机科学教育。他们称，“美国在技术方面领先世界，但我们的高中生中只有 5% 学习计算机科学。这怎么能接受呢？……近三分之二的高技能移民是计算机科学家，每个州都是这种战略人才的进口商。美国有超过 70 万个开放的计算机职位，但每年只有 8 万名计算机科学毕业生。”

无论你有多少存储空间，了解文件占用了多少磁盘空间都是一个重要的考虑事项。我的笔记本有一个相对较小的 250GB NVME 驱动器，大多数时候都没什么问题，但几年前我开始探索 Linux 上的游戏，情况变得有所不同，安装 Steam 和其他游戏使存储管理更加重要。

du 命令

检查磁盘驱动器上剩余存储空间最简单的方法是 du 命令。它会估计文件空间使用情况，像其他所有 Linux 工具一样，du 非常强大，但学会如何根据你的特定需求使用它会很有帮助。我总是查阅手册页来掌握实用程序的用法。du 有几个选项，可以为你提供文件存储的最佳快照，以及它们在系统上消耗多少空间。

du 命令有很多选项，以下是一些常见的：


-a - 包括文件夹和文件在内的存储信息

--apparent-size - 打印自身大小而不是占用磁盘量

-h - 人类可读的格式

-b - 以字节为单位

-c - 总计

-k - 以块为单位

-m - 以兆字节为单位的大小


务必查看 du 手册页获取完整帮助列表。

显示所有文件

你可以选择的第一个选项是 du -a，它可以显示系统上所有文件及其存储目录的大小。这个命令让我知道了我的主目录中存储了 11555168 个字节。使用 du -a 可以快速递归地查看我的存储系统。如果我想要一个更有意义的数字，并且我想深入到目录中查看大文件的位置，该怎么办？

我认为在 Downloads 目录下有一些大文件，所以我输入 du -a /home/don/Downloads 来查看。

$ du -a ~/Downloads
4923    ./UNIX_Driver_5-0/UNIX Driver 50

                              <span>Internxt 发布了一个新产品，它可以让你快速地将加密文件发送给任何人，同时保持你的隐私。嗯，我们只能希望它不会像 Firefox Send 那样关闭吧……




Internxt 是一个相当新的开源加密云服务，旨在取代大型科技公司的产品。例如，你可以把它作为谷歌的相册和云端硬盘的替代品。

它免费提供 10 GB 的容量。所以，如果感兴趣的话，你可以注册个账号试一试。

最近，他们还新增了另一个产品 “Internxt Send”，作为 Firefox Send 的替代品，填补这个空缺。

唉，说到这里还挺遗憾的，Firefox Send 已停止服务了，不得不说它是一个很好的工具！

不过，Internxt Send 让你可以像 Firefox Send 一样安全地发送/共享图像、视频、文档和其他文件。

Internxt Send：一个安全的文件共享服务



我在 GitHub 上找不到 Internxt Send 的存储库，但我已经要求他们澄清了。

（LCTT 译注：虽然 Internxt 是在 GitHub 上开源的，但是 GitHub 上没有 Internxt Send 这个产品的存储库，产品的介绍里也没有声称它是开源的。）

正如你所期望的那样，你无需创建帐户即可将文件上传到 Internxt Send。

文件上传限制为 5 GB。而且，你不能以任何方式提高这个限制。

你可以选择文件，上传并生成共享链接。或者，你也可以直接向收件人发送电子邮件，那样的话，你需要在邮件里分享你的电子邮件地址。



有趣的是，它还允许你在这个电子邮件中添加自定义文本。

与 Firefox Send 不同的是，你无法修改文件共享链接的到期时间，或者是让它在多次下载后失效。默认情况下，链接会在 15 天后过期，你无法更改这个时间。嗯，这还挺扫兴的。

但是，对于那些正在苦苦等待一个加密的共享文件服务的人来说，这可能是一种替代方案。

我认为有更多的 Firefox Send 替代品是件好事！你对 Internxt Send 有何看法？欢迎在下方评论区里和大家分享。

Android 系统源码里编程语言主要有以下几种：
汇编：bootloader和kernel中可能会用到
C语言：这你丫不会，你玩毛的Linux Kenel啊
C++：这你丫不会，你就别搞Android底层开发了，HAL和中间库
Java：这么再不会就自杀吧，framework和app的代码都是Java的
Python：这个不会么也没事，编译相关的
Shell：这个不会么也没事，脚本相关的
Makefile：会C++的肯定知道这个
Android开放源代码 --&gt; AOSP
Android 系统架构
Android的架构是分层的，非常清晰，分工很明确。 Android本身是一套软件堆叠(Software Stack)，或称为「软件叠层架构」， 叠层主要分成三层：操作系统、中间件、应用程序。 Android系统分为4层，包括：

Android 8 之前的系统架构

Android 8 以后的系统架构

应用框架。应用框架最常被应用开发者使用。作为硬件开发者，您应该非常了解开发者 API，因为很多此类 API 都可以直接映射到底层 HAL 接口，并可提供与实现驱动程序相关的实用信息。
Binder IPC。Binder 进程间通信 (IPC) 机制允许应用框架跨越进程边界并调用 Android 系统服务代码，这使得高级框架 API 能…</span>

在实际业务中，app中的H5页面使用的场景越来越多，在货拉拉app中也存在大量的H5页面，比如金秋拉货节、余额、车型介绍页等，加载速度成为了困扰用户的一个痛点。为此我们决定引入离线包方案，另外还需要解决传统离线包方案不灵活，体积大，不易管理，不易降级等问题，我们设计和开发一套H5离线包系统，经过几个sdk版本的迭代，目前货拉拉H5离线包sdk，已在多个业务中落地，接受了大量用户检验。车型介绍页面使用离线包前后打开效果：
行业方案
目前H5离线包方案，通常是将离线包置入assets目录中，打包在apk内部，用户使用过程中再按需加载。所以大部分情况下可能存在以下问题：
由于离线包内容固定导致更新不及时
当离线包内容较多或者离线包个数较多时，会严重影响App包体积
由于离线包内部的逻辑固定，当出现问题时无法降级，无法禁用
上线没有数据对比无法知道上线效果
针对以上痛点，我们团队对离线包进行设计优化，应用于团队内的多个应用，多个业务场景中。
技术实现
H5离线包的基本原理是将html、js、css、图片等静态资源打包到成压缩文件，然后下载到客户端，H5加载时静态资源直接从本地取文件，减少网络请求，提高速度。加载本地文件路径存在的问题和解决：
存在问题
解决方法




cgi请求跨域
跨域请求头增加null支持


cookie跨域问题
目前静态js中无cookie操作，没有cookie跨域问题


localstorage跨域问题
暂时不涉及域名隔离问题，如果有需要，采取调用原生的方式解决


前端使用绝对路径问题
相对路径



4.1 总体结构
H5发布基本流程

App端流程图

前端的打包平台，支持发布为线上页面，也支持发布为离线包。离线包模式时，客户端会先查询是否有离线包需要更新，有则更新，同时支持离线包降级为线上网页。
H5离线包和线上H5一样也能进行更新和升级…</span>

                              <span>对于AndroidDeveloper来说，activity就像初恋一样，启动要求低，响应快，准备得当的前提下能玩的花样也多，但关于activity交互方面的可能问题也有不少，本文将从常见Binder传递数据限制、多个Application对activity跳转的影响等方面进行逐步探讨。
Binder传递数据限制
数据传递限制
通过intent在Activity之间相互跳转时传递数据，已经是最常见的基本操作，但这种操作在特定情况下会引起崩溃，例如以下场景：
Intent intent &#x3D; new Intent(MainActivity.this, NextPageActivity.class); 
Bitmap icon &#x3D; BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.ic_launcher);
Bitmap bitmap &#x3D; Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(icon, 1024, 1024, false); intent.putExtra(&quot;data&quot;,bitmap); 
intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); 
startActivity(intent);

在MainActivity中跳转NextPageActivity页面，并通过intent传递一个bitmap数据，执行上述代码后引起的报错如下：

可见报错原因：Intent传输数据过大，而Android系统对使用Binder进行数据传输的大小做了限制（相关限制定义在frameworks/native/libs/binder/processState.cpp类中，可能因为版本不同而代码有些许不同），通常情况下系统限制为1M，在Android 6和Android 7上单次传输数…</span>

首先上传一张瘦身前通过Analyze app分析出来的图片（打开方式：Android Studio下 ——&gt; Build——&gt; Analyze app）：

APK包结构如下：
lib/：包含特定于处理器软件层的编译代码。该目录包含了每种平台的子目录，像armeabi，armeabi-v7a， arm64-v8a，x86，x86_64，和mips。大多数情况下我们可以只用一种armeabi-v7a，后面会讲到原因。
assets/：包含应用可以使用AssetManager对象检索的应用资源。
res/：包含未编译到的资源 resources.arsc,主要有图片资源文件。
META-INF/：包含CERT.SF和 CERT.RSA签名文件以及MANIFEST.MF 清单文件。
resources.arsc：包含已编译的资源。该文件包含res/values/ 文件夹所有配置中的XML内容。打包工具提取此XML内容，将其编译为二进制格式，并将内容归档。此内容包括语言字符串和样式，以及直接包含在resources.arsc文件中的内容路径 ，例如布局文件和图像。

腾讯的 VasDolly 方案：https://github.com/Tencent/VasDolly
packer-ng-plugin 方案：https://github.com/mcxiaoke/packer-ng-plugin
先从 Github 开源维护的情况看，packer-ng-plugin 项目已经停止维护，Walle 最新的维护是在2年前，VasDolly 最新的维护在5个月前。从开源维护的角度来说，腾讯的 VasDolly 方案，更胜一筹。

VasDolly
先说使用后的体验：
因为 VasDolly 官方最新的版本为 v3.0.4，所以直接集成最新版本的情况，没去试历史旧版本的情况。
项目环境为：
dependencies {
classpath &#x27;com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.3&#x27;
classpath &#x27;com.tencent.vasdolly:plugin:3.0.4&#x27;
}
distributionUrl&#x3D;https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip

即可成功编译，并且按教程配置，可以打出对应的渠道包。官方的 Demo 给的就是这个 Gradle 编译环境。打20个渠道包，时间可以控制在1分钟左右。
但是，例如项目环境为：
dependencies {
classpath &quot;com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.3&quot;

前言
敌机Component重构之后，飞机大战的基础能力就基本成型了。本文会对子弹Component作一次升级，添加游戏中的子弹道具，以及它与战机Component的碰撞处理。

子弹特性
前面只是简单的定义了类Bullet1作为子弹Component，根据已有的属性可以定义一个属于子弹的父类Bullet，这里继续使用抽象类。
abstract class Bullet extends SpriteAnimationComponent with CollisionCallbacks {
  Bullet({required this.speed, required this.attack})
      : super(size: Vector2(5, 11));

  double speed;
  int attack;

  Future bulletAnimation();

  @override
  Future onLoad() async {

                              <span>In Greek mythology, the sacred phoenix, with its characteristically striking plumage in flaming yellow, orange, and red, is known for its ability to resurrect. When the bird’s long life is nearing an end, flames engulf its body, and the being is reborn as a chick in the ashes of its predecessor, giving it the distinction of resilience, regeneration, and immortality. As Yulia Brodskaya began to apply the curled and crimped tendrils of paper to her latest work, she tells Colossal that the firebird portrait “started as a visual representation of a powerful feeling rising from the deep,” adding that “it felt like this portrait has been ‘channelled’ through me.”
Brodskaya captures the subtleties of individual expression and character in her elaborate portraits (previously) and depictions of flora and fauna. More</span>

科学家找到了一类量子算法可以解决的新问题

1994 年数学家 Peter Shor 想出了如何让量子计算机完成普通经典计算机无法做到的事情。原则上，一台基于量子规则的机器可有效地将大数分解为质因数，这对于经典计算机来说，这是一项非常困难的任务。但三十年来，科学家们仅在一个被称为 NP 的标准集中发现了一个单一的、狭窄的问题类别可以显著加速。今年四月，科学家们又发现了一类量子计算可以以指数级速度解决的问题：它涉及仅根据混乱的输出来计算复杂数学过程的输入。

老王点评：目前看起来量子计算还只能用在很狭窄的领域，什么时候可以进行通用计算，或许带来的是颠覆性的变化，对这一天，我是又期盼，又恐惧。




过去十年的本田车型都可能受到网络攻击

安全研究人员发布了他们使用手持无线电解锁和远程启动几辆本田汽车的视频，他们称，这是因为 2012 年至今 10 年间生产的许多本田汽车的无钥匙进入系统存在漏洞。这种攻击使用无线电设备记录来自钥匙扣的合法无线电信号，然后将其传送到汽车上。这被称为重放攻击。理论上，每个信号应该只起一次作用；当按下按钮解锁汽车时，车就会解锁并且这个信号不应该再次用于解锁。但安全研究人员发现，这种攻击之所以奏效是因为它能够重新同步汽车的计数器，使之可以接受旧的代码。但本田否认了这一漏洞。

                              <span>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 是迄今为止最好的 Ubuntu 版本之一。是什么让它如此安全？




早在今年 4 月就发布了的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，是迄今为止最安全的 Ubuntu 版本。

其安全更新的延长支持、新的硬件支持和其他林林总总的改进，使它在安全方面远远超过了之前的所有版本。

但它是如何做到这一点的呢？还有，是什么让这个版本与以前的版本不同的呢？

嗯，有几个原因，Canonical 在一篇新的博客文章中为我们重点指出了这些。在这里，让我总结一下，以帮助你了解更多。

是什么让 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 变得安全？

在这个版本中，Ubuntu 团队似乎投入了大量的工作来确保其长期的安全性和可靠性。尽管多年来他们以难以想象的方式做到了这一点，但我将强调其中的几件事：


改进的硬件安全措施支持

更新了安全包

私有家目录

OpenSSL 3

GCC 11

nftables 作为默认的防火墙后端

Linux 内核改进


1、改进的硬件安全措施支持



随着英特尔、AMD 和 ARM 的 CPU/SoC 开始推出更多的安全措施，拥有足够的软件来让这些功能发挥作用就变得越来越重要。

截至目前，Ubuntu 22.04 支持三种主要的硬件安全措施。

英特尔的 “软件保护扩展Software Guard eXtensions”（SGX）提供了一个安全独立的区域来进行敏感计算。例如，理想情况下，密码处理将在这里进行，因为它确保没有其他应用程序可以访问这些数据。

使用 C 编写的应用程序时，通常有多个源码文件，但最终你需要编译成单个的可执行文件。

你可以通过两种方式来完成这项工作：通过创建一个 静态static 库 或 一个 动态dynamic 库（也被称为 共享shared 库）。从创建和链接的方式来看，它们是两种不同类型的库。选择使用哪种方式取决于你的的具体场景。

在 上一篇文章 中，我演示了如何创建一个动态链接的可执行文件，这是一种更通用的方法。在这篇文章中，我将说明如何创建一个静态链接的可执行文件。

使用静态库链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的多个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名称为可执行文件的一个可运行程序。

静态库是通过复制一个程序中的所有依赖库模块到最终的可执行镜像来创建的。链接器将链接静态库作为编译过程的最后一步。可执行文件是通过解析外部引用、将库例程与程序代码结合在一起来创建的。

创建目标文件

这里是一个静态库的示例以及其链接过程。首先，创建带有这些函数识别标志的头文件 mymath.h :

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：…</span>

                              <span>谷歌编程之夏（GSoC）是一个谷歌举办的国际年度项目，每年都在夏季举办。当贡献者们参与并完成一个 自由开源软件 的编码项目，谷歌 就会给他们发放 津贴。谷歌编程之夏于 2005 年推出，于每年 5 月至 8 月举行。项目创意由参与开源软件开发的主办组织提交，但学生也可以提出自己的项目创意。

今年，该项目向 18 岁或以上的任何人开放 —— 不仅限于学生和应届毕业生了。参与者通过编写软件获得报酬，其 津贴 的金额取决于他们所在国家/地区的 购买力平价。

LCTT 译注：以往，这个活动只允许在校学生参与，今年条件放开，只需年龄 18+ 即可，对参与者的贡献时长要求也降低了，尽可能地让更多人参与进来。不过，今年的报名通道在 4 月 19 日就截止了，大家有兴趣的话明年可以关注一下。

这也是 Zephyr 项目第一次作为 Linux 基金会的项目，参与到谷歌编程之夏中。让我们一起欢迎这些贡献者及其项目吧！

项目一：基于 Zephyr 的 Arduino 模块

1 个贡献者（350 小时）。

Arduino 是一个流行的框架，它为嵌入式设备编程提供了一个简化的接口。最近，Arduino 采用 mbed OS 作为其一些新设备的基础 RTOS。通过这项工作，他们将 Arduino Core 作为独立的抽象层，从 Arduino Core for mbed 中分离出来。这为在其他操作系统上利用 Arduino Core 开辟了可能性。

该项目的想法就是创建一个利用 Arduino Core 的 Zephyr 模块，以便开发人员在与 Arduino 兼容的设备上使用 Arduino 框架时，可以使用 Zephyr 作为底层操作系统。对用户的好处包括：


可以访问 Arduino API 以及高级 Zephyr 功能

2009 年的春天，一个奇奇怪怪的手机玩家社区冒出来，从 Logo 到域名，从前台运营到后台程序，一切都是社群用户一起讨论和搭建的。我也没想到，这会成为我接下来十三年为之奋斗的小事业。
那时的互联网行业，Web 2.0 如日中天，正是下海创业的好时机。知乎还孕育在 Apple4.us 的群体博客里，小红书的创始人还在外企中历练。而我们只是一群小众玩家，真的啥都不懂，只是觉得，网络社区可以一夜之间聚集这么多不同背景、不同领域的用户，真的太神奇了，那种源于内心的喜悦和冲动，也许就是所谓的初心吧。
我从来没有想过，这些人留下的数据和内容就是未来的金钱，而是一直在思考，这样一个有趣的组织形式，这样一群充满热情的人聚在一起，一定能做成一些有价值的事情。所以，三年之后，我们真的有机会以千万估值卖给上市公司的时候，我几乎没有认真考虑过，并不是嫌钱少，而是感觉这件事才刚刚开始，我还有很多想法没有去真正实践。
早年的少数派
2012 年建立的少数派，只是我们解构社区的第一步，从内容链条开始，先做一个闭环看看，但因为缺乏经验和行业资源，随便一做就是三年。
这个阶段，正值移动互联网大潮起步，Talkbox 刚刚火爆，微信黄雀已经悄悄上线，新浪微博开始发力移动客户端。资本市场更是热火朝天，拿个 PPT 就能融个几百万。我们虽然整天研究和体验这些移动应用产品，却从没有想过去做点什么，依然专注搭建高质量的内容体系，不知不觉又错过了一个时代风口。

2016 年，我们终于有了一点基础，正值微信公众号红利期，投资人建议我们放弃一切，all in 公众号粉丝和数据。我们却选择组建产品开发团队，重构自己的社区产品体系，但过度的理想化，对产品预期过高，很快就耗尽资金跌入低谷。
尽管我们几经周折，不断面对行业洗礼，却从没放弃对社区价值体系的底层思考，它不是简单的 UGC 和 PGC，也不仅仅是售卖内容和流量，社区的价值远不止这些。从搭建 Matrix 内容共创体系，到 Tron 计划产品共创模块，这背后是复杂的用户系统、内容付费和商品模块，在有限的资源里，我们一直在克服困难和挑战，一块一块的去完成理想中的社区拼图。
会员首页设计图
今天的少数派会员，已经不是其他平台的内容 VIP 概念，而是一个全新的社区系统了。我们为此打造了全新的内容界面、个人权益中心、专有知识库、以及高质量的话题群。在这个系统里，我们会重新汇聚各个行业的精英用户，尝试与他们深度共创，这些成果会直接进入到已经基本完善的少数派商业链条中，尽管它目前只服务几千人，但我们相信这里的共创价值将是无限的。

当然，每一个共创者，都会享有价值回馈，你的创作、创意、分享都会变成各种权益和收益，汇聚到新的会员中心里。接下来一年，会员社群、会员认证、会员协作链条，都会逐步开发完善起来。
至此，我们才算完成了最初的那个理想中的社区梦想，高质量的交流、高质量的产出、高质量的价值链。从这里开始，我们也算正式开启了第二阶段的创业，而每一个会员用户，都算是这次创业的参与者和见证者，也是那些真正能影响多数人的少数派。
当然，这个选择会带来两个结果，一个是有门槛的筛选，另一个是有限的用户规模，我们又走了一条少数人的路，挑战依然很多，但这才是我们原本的社区初心。
再次感谢大家对少数派十年来的一路支持，这趟新旅程即将开启，欢迎你跟我们一起探索「小众社区」的新价值！</span>

                              <span>THORN 是一个数字内容生产力工具，主要用于帮助你梳理思维碎片，更舒适地进行写作以及更方便地与你的读者分享你的创作。

去年11月开启内测，虽然 THORN 在交互设计和写作体验方面的重视，得到了不少用户的认可，但有不少用户抱怨 THORN 在网络环境不稳定的时候，使用体验并不好。当时，我们的第一反应是，这好像不是 THORN 的问题。
但紧接着，我们心里就冒出个疑问，对于写作类应用来说，网络真的是必须的吗？以此为契机，团队接下来的讨论延伸了一系列的问题，特别是关于隐私和安全方面的问题。
我们果断暂停了开发工作，停下来重新思考 THORN 应该是一个怎样的软件应用？然后，基于隐私、速度和实用的基础，经过大量的调研和实践，我们开始认识到本地优先之于 THORN 的无限可能性:

我们相信数据所有权和实时协作并不矛盾。可以创建具有云应用程序所有优点的软件，同时还允许您保留对您创建的所有数据的所有权和控制权。
我们将这种类型的软件称为本地优先软件，因为它优先使用本地存储，而不是远程数据中心中的服务器。
在云应用程序中，服务器上的数据被视为数据的主要副本；如果客户端拥有数据的副本，则它只是从属于服务器的缓存。任何数据修改都必须发送到服务器。在本地优先应用程序中，我们交换了这些角色：我们将本地设备（笔记本电脑、平板电脑或手机）上的数据副本视为主要副本。服务器仍然存在，但它们保存数据的辅助副本，以帮助从多个设备进行访问。

紧接着，我们豁然开朗，好像所有的问题都被解决了。
回到前面对本地优先软件的描述，好像和一些具备云端备份的本地写作软件没什么区别对吧？ 其实不然，请继续往下看。

不抛弃云端，但是本地优先
对于多设备同步和用户协作，传统的基于云的解决方案已经在很多产品和服务上取得了成功。尽管它们允许您在任何地方访问您的数据，但所有数据的访问都必须通过它们的服务器进行，您只被允许做服…</span>

                              <span>前几天，少楠评论了我的一个即刻动态。

这个动态里的想法源于我在 flomo 共建群里看到的一个群友的提问：

大家有没有什么整理 memo 的小技巧，感觉随着时间推移，大量零碎的不成体系的 memo 增加了我对 flomo 使用的压力。

在整理思路的时候，我上知乎搜了搜，发现这个问题其实很多人都有遇到：记录了很多笔记，但是因为记得太多，导致笔记杂乱、臃肿，仿佛长年累月吃进了很多无法消化的杂食，这些庞大数量的笔记无法变成自己的东西，然后产生了一些压力甚至焦虑。
可能会有的解决办法
有的朋友会选择在定期对笔记进行删减和清空，按照「极简」的思路，对笔记做减法；但也有人说不用删，因为总有一些句子和当时的闪念会启发到你，成为你日后文章的素材。删与不删，让人纠结。
也有的朋友选择了对现有笔记打标签、做分类。这样可以尽可能多地覆盖已有笔记。这也是一个办法。

但是在一次性批量打标签、做分类的过程中，我们无法细致地品味每一个笔记和还原当时记录时的上下文。
说到上下文的还原，我就联想到了「渐进式总结」，通过高亮、笔记和提炼的多个层级的备注，让笔记既能在高空中一目了然，又能潜入笔记的具体上下文。渐进式总结的核心思路是写给未来的自己，所以我们需要尽可能让未来的我们在提取笔记时更容易1。

一个多月前，我在赋闲在家，时间充裕，在 Obsidian 上记的笔记都比较翔实，也会用 Cubox 践行渐进式总结。但是，当我人来到义乌后，经常出门不带电脑，突如其来的碎片化灵感只能记录在 flomo 里，这让我意识到记笔记的场景不一定是深度的阅读和学习。可能是洗澡时某一个闪念一划而过；也可能在读书时的拍案叫绝的临时摘抄；或者是经历过一次新奇体验的“正念时刻”，想要立马记下来。
如果还要我先打上标签，然后列出关键词，还要做好分类，并且要介绍清楚当时的背景、上下文，可能当我写完这些后，灵感已经因为被遮蔽太久，…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Cloud Computing&quot; is the need-based provision of IT resources via the Internet at usage-based prices. Instead of purchasing, owning, and maintaining physical data centres and servers, you can access technology services such as compute, storage, and databases on-demand through a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Key advantages:
Types of Cloud computing:

It’s very good feel that if you are going to learn leading cloud provider AWS. They are the leader in Cloud computing because of:

Gartner Research positions AWS in the Leaders quadrant in the new 2021 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure &amp; Platform Services (CIPS) report. CIPS are defined in the context of this &quot;Magic Quadrant&quot; as &quot;standardised, highly automated offerings in which infrastructure resources (e.g. compute, network and storage resources) are supplemented with integrated platform services&quot;.
Global Infrastructure AWS

AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers so many regions and Availability Zones, all characterized by low latency, high throughput and a highly redundant network. AWS is available in 84 Availability Zones within 26 geographic regions worldwide. In addition, 24 additional Availability Zones and 8 additional AWS regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are planned. The AWS Regions and Availability Zones model is recommended by Gartner as a best practice for running enterprise applications that require high availability.

Instance fields can be initialized in 4 ways: 
At the point of protestation 
In a constructor argument using &#x27;this&#x27; 
In the constructor’s initializer list before the law in braces starts.
Anywhere Differently 
4 is problematic since the preface of null safety. By the time the constructor body( the law in braces) starts, the object must be completely initialized so each of its fields are usable. So if it isn&#x27;t initialized in 1, 2, or 3, it fails to collect. 
It literally means “ I&#x27;ll initialize it latterly ”. And you got no error. 
𝟏- 𝐍𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐞 - 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 
Still, you only know this at runtime when the program fails, If you forget to initialize a late variable. Basically, you say “ Trust me to initialize d ever before it&#x27;s read for the first time ”. So the compiler skips the initialization check and inserts a runtime check. 
𝟐- 𝐑𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐬 
There&#x27;s a stir to allow skipping the initialization checks in some shapes. This may beget segfault which is harder to probe than an ordinary exception. 
𝟑- 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 
Your program needs to know if a late variable has been initialized or not. For this, the compiler frequently creates a retired internal variable that takes memory. 
𝟒- 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 ‘ 𝐢𝐟 ’ 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 
Every time you read a late variable the program must insure it&#x27;s initialized, so a redundant check is added. 
𝟓- 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞.
Every time you write to a late variable the program sets the internal flag to note that it&#x27;s initialized. 
Hopefully, that helped. Did it? 😃

                              <span>Often when debugging, we need to step outside of the comforting embrace of the IDE to reproduce or track an issue. In this series, I’d like to go over some tools you might find useful for these cases. I’ll try to limit myself to tools that are 100% debugging tools and not those that are useful for development testing.
E.g. tools like curl or jq are remarkably useful. You can/should use them while debugging. But you probably used them while building and testing the feature. So you would already be familiar with them and should have some sense of what they do. I want to focus on tools that you would mostly reach for when debugging. In that sense, tools like SDKMan etc. also make no sense here.
I also want to avoid tools like the database tools. They are remarkably useful when debugging, but …</span>

                              <span>In this article, you will learn about the increment operator ++ and the decrement operator -- .
In programming (Java, C, C++, JavaScript etc.), the increment operator ++ decrement operator -- are used.
Increment operator (++) or Decrement operator (--) --&gt; This operators increase the value of variable by 1 or decrease the variable by 1.
int a &#x3D; 5;
a++; //output will be 6
int b &#x3D; 5;
a--; //output will be 4

These operators are further divided into 
1) Prefix increment/decrement operator --&gt; The ++ and -- are placed before number, first evaluate the value and then performs the work.
int a &#x3D; 5;

System.out.println(++a); // here the new value is evaluated that is + so value will be 6 and output will be 6

System.out.println(a);   // output will be 6 because there is no further work to perform.…</span>

Just as a reminder, with this topic we will be able to make our Labeled Range Slider draggable.

To keep it simple we will create a Scribble Composable, to explore how we can handle touch interactions.

For a regular interactive Composable we would normally use either the Modifier clickable:
Canvas(
   modifier &#x3D; Modifier.clickable {
      Log.i(&quot;Tag&quot;, &quot;Canvas clicked&quot;)

Web development, generally referred to as website development, describes the activities involved in developing, constructing, and managing websites and web applications that are used to access info on the internet through a browser.  It might also include database management, website development, and web design. Web development and the task of creating the features and functionality of apps are closely related (web design). Development often refers to the process of actually building these things (that is to say, the programming of sites). HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are the primary computer languages used. The creation of sites that would otherwise need to be built from beginning by writing code is made easier by…</span>

                              <span>Nowadays all clouds have similar offerings. AWS is the more mature one - and therefore a solid choice. However, they are hard to work with in many aspects and have a lot of legacy choices - such as everything being region locked. Google cloud is often seen as the most developer friendly and a great choice if you don&#x27;t want spend hours banging your head against the wall. Azure also offers great developer experience but it&#x27;s less reliable in my experience.
Since we work very closely with the 3 major clouds to develop our product - Multy - I have written a blog post on what I have learned about the differences in Virtual Machines in AWS, Azure and GCP.
The blog post goes over:
Regions and availability zones
Virtual machine types and sizes
SSH access and default users
Virtual machine images
Block storage and disk
If you&#x27;re interested, have a read at https://docs.multy.dev/blog/compute-aws-vs-azure-vs-gcp.
Which cloud provider do you prefer?</span>

                              <span>Did you mess ever with any algorithm that you need in your project? Many times we need to implement an Algorithm for our program to fulfil all the business logic. So Algorithm is a major part of a software or application that defines all the business logic
I started development in 2014. My first project was on Multi-Level Marketing binary Structure also called MLM Binary 1x2.
That was not easy for me to create the Tree logics that will generate dynamically.

It was hard for me to develop all the logic behind that tree with  lots of condition.
In 2014 there was no content on the Internet on how to build complex logic like MLM Binary 1x2. So I deeply did the experiments for almost 30 days. Then finally, I got a solution. I built that web application and provided it to the client. 
The client was so happy because at that time there were very few developers who can do this. And the client ran the project for almost 2 years and earned a lot of money.
So after learning those complex logic, I was thinking other developers in the world facing the same issue. So I started a YouTube channel and told other developers how I build this.
Here is the link - YouTube Channel
 


  
  
  8 Years in developing Algorithms


So I did not stop here to create complex logic. Then I worked for many Software companies to build complex logic for them. I invested my 8 years to just creating logic. 
I think the journey in complex algorithm development will never end. Every day I learn new things and get more ideas. I still enjoy to develop Algorithms.
Creating Algorithms is an Art</span>

Preparation
First, we need to create a Node.js* project and add npm packages puppeteer, puppeteer-extra and puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to control Chromium (or Chrome, or Firefox, but now we work only with Chromium which is used by default) over the DevTools Protocol in headless or non-headless mode. 
To do this, in the directory with our project, open the command line and enter npm init -y, and then npm i puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth.
*If you don&#x27;t have Node.js installed, you can download it from nodejs.org and follow the installation documentation.
📌Note: also, you can use puppeteer without any extensions, but I strongly recommended use it with puppeteer-extra with puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to prevent website detection that you a…</span>

In 1974, API was introduced in a paper called The Relational and Network Approaches: Comparison of the Application Programming Interface. APIs then became part of the ANSI/SPARC framework. It&#x27;s an abstract design standard for DBMS (Database Management Systems) proposed in 1975. 
By 1990, the API was defined simply as a set of services available to a programmer for performing certain tasks. As Computer Networks became common in the 1970s and 1980s, programmers wanted…</span>

Linktree, a popular “link in bio” service, is launching a mobile app on iOS and Android, the company announced on Tuesday. Previously, you’ve had to log into Linktree through a browser on desktop or your phone to manage your profile, but if you prefer an app, that will now be an option. The “majority” of Linktree’s signups and logins from its more than 25 million users happen on a mobile device, according to a Linktree press release, so this new app could prove to be a popular choice for creators.
Link in bio services, which generally let you make a simple page with a list of all the links you want to share with the world, have become more and more popular among creators in recent years. Social networks like Instagram and TikTok only let...

Optics and imaging giant Nikon will stop making new single lens reflex cameras — once the technological mainstay of professional photography — according to a report from Nikkei. 
The death of SLR cameras has been coming for quite some time, as mirrorless alternatives have increased in image quality while offering consumers the option to use lighter and smaller products. 
According to Nikkei, Nikon will continue to produce and distribute its existing SLR models, but will focus development of new models entirely on mirrorless. Nikkei notes that Nikon’s SLR cameras were “widely used by professional cameramen for more than 60 years and have come to be seen as synonymous with the Japanese company.”
Nikon will continue to sell existing DSLR...

We’re on the cusp of a new generation of wireless headphones that are more power-efficient, sound better, and support novel new features like being able to connect an “unlimited” number of devices to a single source. That’s thanks to Bluetooth LE Audio, an umbrella term for a collection of new features for Bluetooth devices that the Bluetooth standards body is officially announcing the completion of today.
Bluetooth LE Audio was announced way back at the beginning of 2020, and the Bluetooth SIG had originally hoped that supporting devices would be released before the end of that year. But, after a significant delay due to the pandemic, the completion of the specification today means that manufacturers can now start adding support for the...

                              <span>Amazon has announced an updated version of its smart Dash Cart — a shopping cart that lets users scan and pay for their purchases as they shop to avoid waiting in checkout lines. 
The original Dash Cart launched in 2020 and Amazon has been slowly rolling them out (ho ho) to its Fresh grocery stores and Whole Foods Market stores. It’s clear they’re still a bit of an experiment, though, and Amazon says the new Dash Cart will only be available at its Westford, Massachusetts Whole Foods store some time “in the coming months,” before slowly heading to other Fresh and Whole Foods locations across the US.
The cart’s main feature is a sensor array in the rim that uses AI-powered cameras and barcode scanners to identify whatever you put in (or...

HMD has announced a trio of new Nokia feature phones including the Nokia 5710 XpressAudio, which has a built-in charging case for an included pair of true wireless earbuds. The company is far from the first to have had this idea (check out 2019’s Servo R25 as one recent example), but it’s notable to see the form factor attempted by a more established company with global reach.
The Nokia 5710 XpressAudio looks like a regular candy bar-style feature phone from the front, with a 2.4-inch display and classic T9 keypad. But around back, there’s a charging compartment, revealed with the slide of a plastic cover. The device will retail for £74.99 (€69) and will be available in the UK in late July, though there’s no word on a US release.

Security researchers and The Drive’s Rob Stumpf have recently posted videos of themselves unlocking and remotely starting several Honda vehicles using handheld radios, despite the company’s insistence that the cars have security protections meant to stop attackers from doing that very thing. According to the researchers, this hack is made possible because of a vulnerability in the keyless entry system in many Hondas made between 2012 and 2022. They’ve dubbed the vulnerability Rolling-PWN.
The basic concept for Rolling-PWN is similar to attacks we’ve seen before used against VWs and Teslas, as well as other devices; using radio equipment, someone records a legitimate radio signal from a key fob, then broadcasts it back to the car. It’s...

Has there ever been a better day to get into Nerf? I’m having a hard time thinking of one. Two of the best, most competitive unmodded blasters cost half their normal price today — including the Dart Zone MK-3 and the Nerf Rival Perses — and I’m seeing huge discounts on a bunch of other actually-fun foam throwers as well. 
Just note that you won’t actually find most of these blasters at Amazon. Target and Walmart are holding the best blaster sales, likely in an attempt to draw focus from their competitor.

Dart Zone MK-3 for $65 (normally $130) at Target. The hobby’s never seen a stock blaster like the MK-3 before, pictured atop this story. You get semi-auto AND full-auto; short darts AND long darts; 8AAs or the option of a drop-in...

在网上搜到这个： https://www.blackdown.org/best-linux-distros-for-virtualbox/，但其一的 Lubuntu 的下载链接居然错的，看来其维护不是太好，似乎也是个人在维护。
那么请教一下，不想折腾，只是普通开发需用一下 Linux 环境，这老台式机的 VirtualBox 跑哪个 Linux 发行版较为流畅？
暂不考虑 WSL ，一是没有图形界面，二是 VirtualBox 与 WSL 冲突，需要在 BIOS 去开或关那个 hyper-v 设置，由于常需 VirtualBox 跑 win7 ，有点麻烦。</span>

这周末同学出差来北京，准备晚上玩会游戏，求推荐几个双人游戏
我有很多设备，但我玩游戏比较少，其实不太了解网游以外其他游戏
PC 和 PS5 均可，NS 我俩都不太爱玩，而且我没什么 NS 游戏，还是国行机器
我只有一个 PS5 手柄，一个 Xbox 手柄，也就是说如果想玩 PS 或者 PC 上的双人游戏，我需要买手柄转接器？ xbox 手柄和 PS 手柄应该无法直接在对方的主机端使用吧</span>

原文内容是
PrimaryExpr &#x3D;
Operand |
Conversion |
MethodExpr |
PrimaryExpr Selector |
PrimaryExpr Index |
PrimaryExpr Slice |
PrimaryExpr TypeAssertion |
PrimaryExpr Arguments .

Selector       &#x3D; &quot;.&quot; identifier .
Index          &#x3D; &quot;[&quot; Expression &quot;]&quot; .
Slice          &#x3D; &quot;[&quot; [ Expression ] &quot;:&quot; [ Expression ] &quot;]&quot; |

Arguments      &#x3D; &quot;(&quot; [ ( ExpressionList | Type [ &quot;,&quot; ExpressionList ] ) [ &quot;...&quot; ] [ &quot;,&quot; ] ] &quot;)&quot; .

其中我关心的是 Arguments 的定义，它表示为 ( ExpressionList | Type [ &quot;,&quot; ExpressionList ] )
ExpressionList 很容易理解，它可以匹配 (1,2,string(1)) 这样的文本，但是 Type [ExpressionList] 怎么理解呢，我从来没见过在 go 里可以写 var v &#x3D; func_call(TypeName) 这样的表达式
（在上面引用的文本中，[ ] 包裹的内容表示为可选, | 表示匹配其中一个）</span>

昨天还在为 WPS 辩护，觉得分享被审核很正常，这个逻辑主要是因为自己经常打开网盘的公开分享链接，后来一想，我把文档分享给我的同事、亲人、朋友，你凭什么偷看？ 我分享只是一个投递的过程，又不是公开的过程
鉴于目前的大环境，也不排除国家正当的要求（譬如下面的英国），金山还是要在用户隐私和监管做平衡，譬如访问很少的链接就不要去扫描，访问很多又可能造成公共事件的再去扫描审核，这样是不是可以取得平衡？
网上的新闻：
根据最新修订的英国数字安全立法，可能要求 WhatsApp 等高度加密的消息服务采用尖端技术来发现儿童性虐待材料，否则会面临巨额罚款。在线安全法案的修正案将要求科技公司“尽最大努力”部署新技术，以识别和删除儿童性虐待和剥削内容 (CSAE)。
根据提议的修正案，Ofcom 监管机构将能够要求科技公司部署或开发新技术，以帮助发现滥用材料并阻止其传播。该修正案收紧了法案中的现有条款，该条款已经赋予 Ofcom 要求部署“认可技术”的权力。如果现有技术不适合他们的平台，现在的变化将要求公司使用他们的“最大努力”来部署或开发“新”技术。</span>

If you&#x27;re reading this article from home, you are probably connected with a LTE/5G/DSL/WIFI router. Such devices are usually responsible to route packets between your local devices (smartphone, PC, TV, and so on) and provide access to the world wide web through a built-in modem. Your router at home has most likely a web-based interface for configuration purposes. Such interfaces are often oversimplified as they are made for casual users.
If you want more configuration options, but don&#x27;t want to spend for a professional device you should take a look at an alternative firmware such as OpenWrt.

An application written using programming languages like C and C++ requires you to program the destruction of objects in memory when they&#x27;re no longer needed. The more your application grows, the great the probability that you&#x27;ll overlook releasing unused objects. This leads to a memory leak and eventually the system memory gets used up, and at some point there&#x27;s no further memory to allocate. This results in a situation where the application fails with an OutOfMemoryError. But in the case of Java, Garbage Collection (GC) happens automatically during application execution, so it alleviates the task of manual deallocation and possible memory leaks.

GameStop is seemingly ignoring that whole ”crypto winter” thing and moving ahead with the launch of its own NFT marketplace, which is now open in what the company calls a “public beta.” 
Right now, you can use the platform to buy, sell, and create NFTs. There are more than 200 collections you can peruse and more than 53,000 NFTs listed on the marketplace. The art I’ve seen seems to be pretty standard NFT fare — in just a few minutes of perusing, I’ve already spotted some some weird cat and monkey-themed collections, for example. Unsurprisingly, you can connect the newly-launched GameStop Wallet to manage your digital assets, though you can also use options like WalletConnect and MetaMask. And not just anyone can create an NFT on the...

Where in the world are Su Zhu and Kyle Davies? The founders of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) are nowhere to be found, according to officials charged with liquidating the bankrupt company (via Reuters). According to a court document filed Friday, Zhu and Davies’ whereabouts are currently unknown, and its liquidators say they have not received “any meaningful cooperation” from the two.
The Singapore-based 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy earlier this month, a move designed to protect foreign companies’ assets from creditors in the US. News of the bankruptcy filing surfaced after 3AC defaulted on a $670 million loan provided by crypto broker Voyager Digital, which has since filed for bankruptcy as well. 3AC...

                              <span>目前，常见的消灭癌细胞方式都无法做到只针对有害细胞而不损害其他健康细胞。近日，针对这一问题，日本大阪大学的研究人员发现，可以利用一种对癌细胞格外“热情”的微型蠕虫，这种蠕虫是生活在海洋中的线虫，食用后能够寄生在人类体内并进行繁殖，它对癌细胞表现出非同寻常的兴趣。只要在这种蠕虫外涂上一层水凝胶制成的鞘，便可使其附着在癌细胞上，进而运输抗癌药杀死癌细胞。相关研究发表在近日的《今日材料生物》杂志上。（视频：@智慧科技迷）

一个应用的好快可以用四个字来概括，即“用户体验”
一、用户体验
用户体验（User Experience，简称UE/UX）是用户在使用产品过程中建立起来的一种纯主观感受。但是对于一个界定明确的用户群体来讲，其用户体验的共性是能够经由良好设计实验来认识到。计算机技术和互联网的发展，使技术创新形态正在发生转变，以用户为中心、以人为本越来越得到重视，用户体验也因此被称做创新2.0模式的精髓。在中国面向知识社会的创新2.0——应用创新园区模式探索中，更将用户体验作为“三验”创新机制之首。 ISO 9241-210标准将用户体验定义为 “人们对于针对使用或期望使用的产品、系统或者服务的认知印象和回应”。通俗来讲就是“这个东西好不好用，用起来方不方便”。因此，用户体验是主观的，且其注重实际应用时的产生的效果。 ISO定义的补充说明有着如下解释：用户体验，即用户在使用一个产品或系统之前、使用期间和使用之后的全部感受，包括情感、信仰、喜好、认知印象、生理和心理反应、行为和成就等各个方面。该说明还列出三个影响用户体验的因素：系统，用户和使用环境。
然而，所有的用户体验的前提是使用产品
使用产品的第一个要点就是启动速度，这也是所有产品一直追求启动优化的原因。
在建立分位制，用标准去量化优化效果 一文中，我列举出了很多启动优化的优化项，这也是应用层开发常使用的优化手段；
二、变异的常规优化
使用上述的一些常规优化之后，还能不能提升启动速度呢？答案是可以的，做法就是在空间和时间上做一些调整，其中最为卓著的就是 “有向无环图启动器”
2.1 有向无环图启动器解析
首先，他的作者也是通过常规优化的手段切入，然后将启动项分成了很多单独的任务，最后利用有向无环图这个数据结构将任务的调度进行了先后顺序的排列，从而加快了启动速度。

1. 前言
在移动应用开发中，列表组件是一个非常常见的 UI 组件，绝大多数应用开发中都会使用到列表组件进行界面的开发，在 Android 开发中列表组件一般使用官方提供的 RecyclerView ，而 RecyclerView 的常规开发需要手动创建对应的 Adapter、ViewHolder 代码，且每个 RecyclerView 的使用都需要编写这种的样板代码，存在重复代码，降低了开发效率，于是为了提高列表的开发效率（偷懒）就有了各种对 RecyclerView 封装的框架来简化其开发流程，本篇就是其中一种框架的实现。
先给框架起个名字吧，emmm... 起名什么的真的是太难了，比写代码难多了，最后绞尽脑汁的想了一个 ardf，英文 “android rapid development framework” 的缩写，即 “Android 快速开发框架”，很好，已经完成这个框架的 50% 工作了。
2. 实现思路
名字想好了，下一步就是想想怎么来实现，框架的核心目的是简化开发流程，对于 RecyclerView 开发来说，RecyclerView 的创建 和 item 的布局肯定是必不可少的，于是只能从 Adapter 和 ViewHolder 来着手简化，Adapter 和 ViewHolder 的作用主要是为了加载 item 的布局和对 item 的展示数据和事件进行处理，如果能把这一块做成通用的就不用每次都创建 Adapter 和 ViewHolder 了。
最后想到了使用 DataBinding 来进行封装，通过 DataBinding 的扩展将 item 布局、列表数据及事件都通过 xml 设置到 Adapter 里，在 Adapter 里再通过 DataBinding 加载 item 的布局文件最终创建 ViewHolder…</span>

如微信的MMKV 组件、美团的Logan组件，还有微信的日志模块xlog，为什么大厂偏爱它呢？他到底有什么魔力么？我认为主要原因如下：
跨平台，C++编写，可以支持多平台
跨进程，通过文件共享可以实现多个进程内存共享，实现进程通信
高性能，实现用户空间和内核空间的零拷贝，速度快且节约内存等
高稳定，页中断保护神，由操作系统实现的，稳定性可想而知
函数介绍
void* mmap(void* addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);

addr 代表映射的虚拟内存起始地址；
length 代表该映射长度；
prot 描述了这块新的内存区域的访问权限；
flags 描述了该映射的类型；
fd 代表文件描述符；
offset 代表文件内的偏移值。
mmap的强大之处在于，它可以根据参数配置，用于创建共享内存，从而提高文件映射区域的IO效率，实现IO零拷贝，后面讲下零拷贝的技术，对比下，决定这些功能的主要就是三个参数，下面一一解释
prot
四种情况如下：
PROT_EXEC，代表该内存映射有可执行权限，可以看成是代码段，通常存储CPU可执行机器码
PROT_READ，代表该内存映射可读
PROT_WRITE，代表该内存映射可写
PROT_NONE，代表该内存映射不能被访问
flags
比较有代表性的如下：
MAP_SHARED，创建一个共享映射区域
MAP_PRIVATE，创建一个私有映射区域
MAP_ANONYMOUS，创建一个匿名映射区域，该情况只需要传入-1即可
MAP_FIXED，当操作系统以addr为起始地址进行内存映射时，如果发现不能满足长度或者权限要求时，将映射失败，如果非MAP_FIXED，则系统就会再找其他合适的区域进行映射
fd

                              <span>1. 背景
在Flutter Test官方的CI方案中，包含UnitTest/WidgetTest/DriverTest三种模式，其中UnitTest/WidgetTest是可以在代码的沙盒环境下运行，而Driver Test需要依赖整包构建；大家都知道在单元测试过程中发现问题成本最低，而整包构建耗时比较久，因此这里介绍一种通用的Flutter Test在CI阶段的方案；
Flutter CI自动化检测能力主要通过FlutterTest能力建设，但具体数据能力建设稍有不足，主要原因是
FlutterTest不支持直接发送一个http请求功能；
以及大量的Channel数据需要主动MOCK，如果大型应用需要mock的太多太杂；
同理可以看在stackoverflow上也有很多人咨询过为什么flutter test环境下无法运行一个HTTP服务请求；
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62184160/flutter-testing-passing-an-actual-http-client-instead-of-a-mocked-one
其实分析主要原因是一个在Flutter Test的沙盒环境下，无法运行engine侧很多代码，导致socket服务不能正常发，因此在CI下网络服务是断开的；鉴于此很多mock服务比如flutter mockite就提供一种方案自己维护mock数据，但是这种方式维护成本就非常高了，大家都是程序员，谁也不愿意去维护mock数据，何况业务天天变动情况下；
分析下其思路主要是通过setupMockHttpOverrides覆盖全局的Http，然后将请求服务转接到mock处理逻辑中；

有一天你正在王者团战里杀的热火朝天，忽然公司测试人员打你电话问为什么某个功能数据展示不出来了，昨天还好好的纳，是不是你又偷偷写bug了。。。WTF!，你会说你把手机给我，我连上电脑看看打印的请求日志是不是接口有问题，然后吭哧吭哧搞半天看到接口数据返回的格式确实不会，然后去群里丢了几句服务端人员看一下这个接口，数据有问题。然后有回去打游戏，可惜游戏早已结束，以失败告终，自己还没无情的举报禁赛了。。。人生最痛苦的事莫过于如此。假如你的项目已经继承了抓包助手，并且也给其他人员较少过如何使用，那么像这类问题根本就不需要你再来处理了，遇到数据问题他们第一时间会自己看请求数据，而你就可以安心上王者了。
二、Android抓包现状
目前常见的抓包工具有Charles、Fiddler、Wireshark等，这些或多或少都需要一些配置，略显麻烦，只适合开发及测试人员玩，如果产品也想看数据怎么办纳，别急，本文的主角登场了，你可以在项目中集成AndroidMonitor，只需两步简单配置即可实现抓包数据可视化功能，随时随地，人人都可以方便快捷的查看。
三、效果展示
俗话说无图无真相




四、如何使用
抓包工具有两个依赖需要添加：monito和monitor-plugin
Demo下载体验
1、monitor接入
添加依赖
   debugImplementation &#x27;io.github.lygttpod:monitor:0.0.4&#x27;

-备注： 使用debugImplementation是为了只在测试环境中引入
2、monitor-plugin接入
根目录build.gradle下添加如下依赖

需求分析
如何创建一个全局通知的弹窗?如下图所示。

从手机顶部划入，短暂停留后，再从顶部划出。
首先需要明确的是：
2、Dialog弹窗必须支持手势,用户在Dialog上向上滑时,Dialog需要退出,点击时可能需要处理点击事件。

前言
Component实现碰撞检测，添加了碰撞的反馈效果后，整个效果就暂时闭环了。本文会着重在敌机Component的重构工作。借此机会将其余类型的敌机Component添加进来。
笔者将这一系列文章收录到以下专栏，欢迎有兴趣的同学阅读：
基于Flutter&amp;Flame 的飞机大战开发笔记
抽象
之前的类Enemy1是一种类型的敌机Component，它具备了敌机在飞机大战中的基本功能：
在无碰撞情况下，从屏幕最上方匀速移动到屏幕最下方，最终从Component树中移除。
具备碰撞检测的能力，与战机Component/子弹Component发生碰撞时，会有生命值减少情况。
生命值为0时，产生销毁/击毁效果。
其实这里还缺了一个与战机Component/子弹Component发生碰撞时，减少生命值的效果。结合上述几点，我们需要添加多种敌机Component到屏幕上。所以需要将敌机Component的特性进一步抽象出来。
结合上述的特性，定义了抽象类Enemy。
SpriteAnimationComponent
先来说说不同状态的动画帧播放方案。前文我们利用SpriteAnimationComponent的播放能力，在敌机Component被击毁时设置playing &#x3D; true。但此时敌机Component至少有3种状态，分别是正常、被攻击、销毁，可以定义一个枚举
enum EnemyState {
  idle,
  hit,
  down,
}

这里可以用SpriteAnimationGroupComponent代替SpriteAnimationComponent，通过设置参数current来切换当前的状态，从而切换对应的动画效果。大概瞄一下源码吧

The heavily patterned works, which have shifted from functional to decorative, are made by hand-knotting wool and layering the yarn into lush, textured motifs.
Drawing on her background in textile design, Finnish artist Marianne Huotari translates this technique into ceramics, creating densely delicate reliefs that evoke the depth and dimension of fiber. Huotari begins every work with a color palette and surface, whether in the form of a wall-based piece or a freestanding sculpture. More</span>

Minimal in form and lush in construction, the creatures include a dandelion-headed brontosaurus, a stegosaurus with spiky raspberry leaves defining its back, and a velociraptor laced with forget-me-nots.

                              <span>一、写在前面
北漂快两年整了，经历了一次搬家，换了两次居住环境，这次由于租房合同到期、房东涨价以及疫情小区封控，因此打算换个居住环境。
我对租房的观念一直是这不仅仅只是一个睡觉的地方。不是白天在格子间当了一天社畜，晚上下班回来就只是睡个觉。我觉得租房更多的是在漂泊的城市拥有一个属于自己的家。之前在网上看到一句话很赞同：「你的生活质量也决定着你的生活状态，塑造自己的生活标准，并创造一个优雅、舒适的独处时光吧。」
其实我觉得租房还挺简单的，无非是在通勤、合租还是整租、房租这三个主要因素之间找到平衡。钱到位，什么都不是问题，三环里整租一套也不是梦，所以还是要多赚钱。预算不足的话，只能选择牺牲点什么换取相对优势了。比如我去年租的房就是牺牲了通勤（一天通勤总时长为 2h），但是整租了一套郊区 60 平的一居室大房子，要多舒服有多舒服。
去年找房很顺利，前期准备比较充足，从网上浏览了大量的租房经验帖，再加上好朋友 90 的帮忙，跟着中介只看了一套房就定下了。然后就和 90、阮哥成为了邻居，邻居日常送温暖，搬家最舍不得就是中国好邻居和他们的大金毛了。

二、个人情况
虽然自己房子七月初才到期，但担心疫情又居家隔离不能及时线下看房，加上自己不想拖到后面焦虑，所以我从 6 月初就开始在租房平台上看房，然后挑了个周末线下看了一下午房，一周时间就确定了要租的房子。
因为之前独居一年，经历过三次居家隔离，最长的一次一个月都没有人和我说话，再加上房租涨价，让我这次考虑了合租而不是整租。还有一点是自己整租一居室，发现实际利用率比较高的也就卧室和书桌，而客厅沙发、电视机一年没用过几次，因为公司管三餐所以工作日也不自己做饭，厨房利用率也很低，因此感觉自己整租一居室有点奢侈。而且这次是打算搬到三环、四环附近，之前住郊区五环外进城一趟还是有点麻烦，路上花的时间较多。加上自己并不喜欢自如这种统一的装修风格，也不…</span>

                              <span>前言
在钢笔市场，最能被大家接受的价位在几十块到小几百之间，价位中覆盖了主流的日德钢尖钢笔和少部分入门的14K金笔，从书写体验而言，这些产品已经可以让大家体验到现代钢笔的使用效果，并且相当稳定。
在海外品牌中，日本钢笔是对于初涉钢笔的爱好者们最为友好的产品了，大众款的笔迹细，搭配合适的墨水和纸张，能做到类似中性笔的粗细效果，在新手看重的顺滑度属性方面，日产钢笔也做得相对不错，符合新人对于钢笔的期待。
趣味文具箱整理了1000~3000日元、5000~10000日元、10000日元+三个价位，2022年在日本文具店受欢迎的日本品牌钢笔，下文来看看这些流行的大众款钢笔！
3000日元以下的严选推荐-实用的日本产钢笔

本国生产的钢笔一直是稳定和安心的代名词，2022年，白领们有了在办公室使用钢笔的新风向，大家都希望买到的钢笔有好看的笔杆，尽量不要有廉价感，也只是混在文具盒中，和其它笔类放在一起，预算就是3000日元以下。
目前此定位下最火热的钢笔就是百乐【LIGHTIVE】，型号就是百乐将LIGHT和ACTIVE结合而成创造的一个词汇，设计理念是兼具外观设计性和功能性，方便好用的钢笔，主要的客单目标就是首次在办公室尝试实用钢笔的30~40岁区间的白领们。笔帽内有全新设计的防干盖，可以减少墨水挥发干尖的情况。整笔重量仅仅是12g，非常轻巧，随身携带，大量书写，记录都很合适。在日本的售价是2000日元，价格相当有竞争力。
LIGHTIVE的笔尖和百乐佩尔娜是同款，百乐宣传是特殊合金工艺，有F尖、M尖两个不同的粗细。
笔帽内部设计了防干内帽，相当于白金的滑封气帽技术，但白金专利是内部有弹簧，这个双重帽可以减少笔尖干尖的情况。
笔杆是树脂，漆面装饰，金属件镀黑处理，外观看起来是相当时尚。

在日本上市的这个LIGHTIVE，其实早在19年就在我国上市了，型号叫做冒险者，EXPLORER…</span>

马斯克曾多次公开表示，他希望知道有多少推特账户是由机器人运营的，因为他觉得可疑账户的数量影响了公司的价值。因此他寻求检测和处理虚假账户的方法。当推特最终提供了马斯克明确要求的 8 个开发者 API 的访问权时，这些 API 的速率限制低于推特向其最大企业客户提供的速率限制。马斯克称，这使得他们无法在任何合理的时间内完成数据分析。

许多老的 X.Org 组件在本周末有新的发布

上周末，Oracle 的长期 X.Org 贡献者 Alan Coopersmith 对各种旧的、很少维护的 X.Org 项目发布了许多新的更新。这些软件多年来没有任何更新，新的版本大多只是收集了过去几年中的一些随机修复。总的来说，这些更新并没有什么值得兴奋的改进。

老王点评：这是觉得 X.org 快被放弃了才最后抢救一次？从另外一方面看，可见 X.org 社区有多冷清了。连随手收到的一些修复都懒得发布个新版本。

如果你计划永久的转移到 Linux 系统上，你应该会很高兴地知道在 Linux 上有数以千计的能与商业或付费应用媲美的应用。如果你是第一次使用 Linux 的 Windows 用户，你可能都没有听说过这些应用。

因此，在这一系列文章中，我们每一篇重点介绍一组 Ubuntu 应用，以增加 Linux 用户们的协作和认识。

这是 Ubuntu 应用程序系列的第二篇文章，如果你错过了其他部分，可以在这里阅读：


第一篇


1、OBS Studio

第一个应用是著名的 流媒体应用 —— OBS Studio 。这是一款自由开源的应用，主要用于互联网上的流媒体应用。此外，你可以使用该应用创建一个复杂的流媒体项目，包括多源、覆盖式横幅等功能。

而且，由于它能够支持“实时消息传输协议Real-Time Messaging Protocol”（RTMP），你可以使用它在 Facebook、Youtube、Twitch 以及其他支持的平台上进行流式传输。

这个有十年历史的应用程序是 Linux 上最好的应用程序之一。



你可以在 OBS Studio 官网 了解更多的信息并下载，或者通过以下方式安装。

通过 PPA 在 Ubuntu 和相关发行版上安装：

sudo add-apt-repository ppabsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt update
sudo apt install obs-studio


如果你希望通过 Flatpak 安装 ，首先 为 Flatpak 设置系统 然后 通过这个页面安装 。

                              <span>前几天我试图安装 massCode 应用。对于安装，它提供了一个 Snap 文件以供下载。

当我尝试从 Snap 文件安装应用程序时：

sudo snap install snap_file


它给了我以下错误：

error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap &quot;masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap&quot;




这很奇怪。在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 时，你必须添加 GPG 密钥。但是这里的开发人员没有提供这样的东西。

“修复”简单易行。让我给你解释一下。

处理 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 错误

这里其实不涉及签名。

发生的情况是你从第三方下载了 Snap 安装程序。 Ubuntu 中的 Snap 机制希望你从官方 Snap 商店获取 Snap 包。

由于它不是来自 Snap 商店，因此你会看到 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 的错误消息。与大多数错误消息一样，这个错误消息不是描述性的。

那么，这里的解决方案是什么？

任何未通过 Snap 商店分发的 Snap 包都必须使用 --dangerous 选项进行安装。这就是规则。

sudo snap install --dangerous path_to_snap_file


这样，你告诉 Snap 包管理器显式安装 Snap 包。

在这里，我使用了这个选项并且能够成功地从它的 Snap 包中安装 massCode。



以这种方式安装 Snap 包有多“危险”？几乎和下载并 安装 deb 格式安装包 相同。

在我看来，如果你是从项目开发者的网站上下载 Snap 包，你已经在信任该项目了。在这种情况下，你可以使用 --dangerous 选项安装它。

当然，你应该首先搜索该软件包是否在 Snap 商店中可用：

snap find package_name


我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你修复 Snap 错误。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。如果你想了解更多信息，请参阅 这个使用 Snap 命令指南。

使用的组件 TabLayout ViewPager NestScrollView RecyclerView
主要实现
首先我们要自定义一个我 ScrollView 继承自 NestedScrollView，重写 onMeasure 方法，在这个方法中我们获取 scrollview 可以滚动的最大距离，再重新 onNestedPreScroll 方法，在这里面去判断是否先消费子级的滚动。下面是主要代码展示
public class MyScrollView extends NestedScrollView {

    private final String TAG &#x3D; &quot;MyScrollView&quot;;

    private int maxScrollHeight;

    public MyScrollView(Context context) {
        super(context);
    }

    public MyScrollView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    public MyScrollView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) {
        super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
        super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);

        //获取scrollView 最大可滚动的距离
        maxScrollHeight &#x3D; this.getChildAt(0).getMeasuredHeight() - this.getMeasuredHeight();
    }


    @Override
    public void onNestedPreScroll(@NonNull View target, int dx, int dy, @NonNull int[] consumed,
                                  int type) {

        super.onNestedPreScroll(target, dx, dy, consumed, type);

        //如果最大可滚动距离大于 0 则表示 scrollview 可以滚动，则去先消费用户滑动
        if(this.maxScrollHeight &gt; 0){
            //判断用户是否是向上滑动，并且没有超出 scrollview 可滑动的最大距离
            boolean headerScrollUp &#x3D; dy &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; getScrollY()  0;

            //如果 scrollview 可以滑动，则去消费滑动
            if (headerScrollUp || headerScrollDown) {
                scrollBy(0, dy);
                consumed[1] &#x3D; dy;
            }
            //通知子列表，父级消费的距离
            this.dispatchNestedPreScroll(dx, dy, consumed, null, type);
        }
    }
}

接着我们需要将 tab view 的内容高的设置为整个屏幕高度，这样我们在往上滚动的时候，最后就会只剩下 tab 的内容。下面是主要代码展示。
//动态设置外层布局的高度，让整个 tab 页为屏幕高度
LinearLayout linearLayout &#x3D; this.findViewById(R.id.linearLayout);
LinearLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams &#x3D; new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, height);
linearLayout.setLayoutParams(layoutParams);

前言
本篇文章是《Android开发艺术探索》第8章的理解和实践，该篇文章涉及的源码知识点较多，来逐一分解。
为什么会突然想了解一下Window呢，原因有如下2个：
一个是在Android View工作原理的探索时有提及到ViewRootImpl这个类，当时说的是该类负责View的测量、布局和绘制，那这个ViewRootImpl的来由是什么，为什么是它来负责绘制；
一个是我们经常使用Dialog、PopupWindow等弹窗，同时设置其Window属性，但是这些有什么区别，各种Window的属性又是啥。
而这俩个原因，从某种程度上说就说明了为什么Android需要设计出这个Window。这里我们先说一些概念和设计原则，再来一一通过实践和源码来理解。

其实关于Window的知识点比较多，这里我们先说概念，先有一个总体的认识，这样比较方便理解。
一些概念
首先，Window表示是一个窗口的概念，在大屏的电脑屏幕上我们比较好理解，我打开一个应用，就是一个窗口，在Android中是一个应用定义为一个窗口还是一个Dialog就定义为一个窗口呢，真实情况如何。
Window和View的关系
这和我们普通的认知是不一样的，在Android中Window是一个抽象的概念，Android所有的视图都是通过Window来呈现，不论是Activity、Dialog还是Toast，视图实际都可以看成是附加在window上，即Window是View的载体。
这里如何理解呢 我们看到的EditText、ImageView等…</span>

前言
线程优化一直是启动优化中的一个必不可少的项目。作为一个 Android 程序员，你肯定希望应用启动的时候，火力全开，线程池拉满，每一个 CPU 核心满载而行。
可你把线程池拉满的时候，启动时长就一定会降低吗？
结果显然是否定的，之前我在进行启动优化的时候，就遇到了类似的问题。我引入了有向无环图类似的启动库后，又将线程池的数量设置为：
CPU核心数 * 2 + 1
看似没什么问题，后续启动时长居然还增长了一点点。

为什么会出现这样的问题？我们今天就好好聊聊。
一、做个实验
先做个实验，在应用启动过程中，主要做了两步：
主线程循环 10w 次，做一些简单的计算
线程池做一些异步任务，读取文件，然后将读取到的数据写入数据库，这个异步任务提交了 1000 次
核心线程数 &#x3D; 2 * CPU 核心数 + 1，变量最大线程数：
实验一：最大线程数 &#x3D; 2 * CPU 核心数 + 1
实验二：最大线程数 &#x3D; Int.MAX_VALUE
在模拟器上，实验二平均启动时长 6505 ms，实验一平均启动时长 5521 ms，从这点看，线程开太多对主线程是有影响的。
二、基础知识
在启动流程中基础知识必不可少，从上往下讲就是线程、线程池、内核 和 CPU，这些知识都是老生常谈了。
1. 线程
线程是操作系统进行运算调度的最小单位，可以理解为它就是系统执行的任务。
作为任务，它会有各种状态：
NEW(新建)：新创建的线程，还没有启动
RUNNABLE(可运行)：可以运行的线程
BLOCKED(阻塞)：阻塞状态的线程
WAITTING(等待)：等待状态
TIME_WAITTING(计时等待)
TERMINATED(终止)
各种状态可以进行如下转换：

处于可运行状态的线程不一定处于运行中，如果 CPU 核心数

原文链接：The Dark Secrets of Fast Compilation for Kotlin
前言
快速编译大量代码一向是一个难题，尤其是当编译器必须执行很多复杂操作时，例如重载方法解析和泛型类型推断。 本文主要介绍在日常开发中做一些小改动时，Kotlin编译器是如何加快编译速度的
为什么编译那么耗时?
编译时间长通常有三大原因：
代码库大小：通常代码码越大，编译耗时越长
你的工具链优化了多少，这包括编译器本身和你正在使用的任何构建工具。
你的编译器有多智能：无论是在不打扰用户的情况下计算出许多事情，还是需要不断提示和样板代码
前两个因素很明显，让我们谈谈第三个因素：编译器的智能。 这通常是一个复杂的权衡，在 Kotlin 中，我们决定支持干净可读的类型安全代码。这意味着编译器必须非常智能，因为我们在编译期需要做很多工作。
Kotlin 旨在用于项目寿命长、规模大且涉及大量人员的工业开发环境。
因此，我们希望静态类型安全，能够及早发现错误，并获得精确的提示（支持自动补全、重构和在 IDE 中查找使用、精确的代码导航等）。
然后，我们还想要干净可读的代码，没有不必要的噪音。这意味着我们不希望代码中到处都是类型。 这就是为什么我们有支持 lambda 和扩展函数类型的智能类型推断和重载解析算法等等。 Kotlin 编译器会自己计算出很多东西，以同时保持代码干净和类型安全。
编译器可以同时智能与高效吗?
为了让智能编译器快速运行，您当然需要优化工具链的每一部分，这是我们一直在努力的事情。 除此之外，我们正在开发新一代 Kotlin 编译器，它的运行速度将比当前编译器快得多，但这篇文章不是关于这个的。
不管编译器有多快，在大型项目上都不会太快。 而且，在调试时所做的每一个小改动都重新编译整个代码…</span>

引子
线上 App 某个版本之后，服务端同学从埋点数据中发现一个奇怪的现象：“所有界面的 Activity.onPause() 过后，得等 10 秒整，才回调 Activity.onStop()。”
这么扯吗？是不是统计数据有问题？
怎么可能？Activity 生命周期是系统控制的呀？
为啥是如此诡异，正正好好的 10 秒？
App 岂不是会很卡？ANR 蹭蹭往上？
从哪切入排查？
接手该问题后，一连串问号涌现。。。
检测 &amp; 复现
在一口闷三杯咖啡之后，我决定。。先上个厕所。（咖啡利尿）
定神之后，我做出了一个关键决定：先稳定复现问题。这是修复任何问题的第一步。
于是乎写出了这样的检测代码：
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
       super.onCreate()
       registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(object : ActivityLifecycleCallbacks {
           override fun onActivityPaused(activity: Activity) {

               Log.v(&quot;test&quot;,

去年7月份我发布了 《维护两个10k+Star的Github项目，会遇到什么有趣的问题》 的相关吐槽，当时 JYM 看得还是挺乐呵的，时隔一年之后，让我们来看看又有什么充满“智慧”的问题，为你展示真实高 Star 开源项目维护者的心路历程。
注意⚠️：阅读本文可能会浪费您宝贵的 5 分钟，本篇主要是吐槽和分享过去一年维护 Github 项目以来的一些有趣的经历，所以阅读本文并不会增长你的技术，但是如果你想做开源，想了解开源项目维护者的心理，那可能会给你带来一些启发😊。
其实参与开源这么多年，相信大家都有所体会，特别是 Android 开发，在经历了曾经 Android 开源的辉煌时代之后，如今还在坚持的人真的不多，不说还维护开源项目，就说还在单纯从事 Android 开发的也不多了，从  AndroidGithubBoss 项目的统计上看，排名前 10 还在维护的纯 Android 开源项目寥寥无几，可以看到几乎都是金色的 Deprecated 状态。

为什么呢？首先是现在的 Android 项目获取流量的能力已经大幅度下降，官方 Jetpack 体系的成熟也挤压了第三方开源项目的市场。
另外，虽然做开源项目至今也有 7 年了，但是每次打开 Github 的通知中心，看到这样的场景时都难免会心颤一下，因为对于个人开源维护者来说，Github 的小蓝点有时候就像是“催命符“，有时候可能都很急，在等着救命。

个人开源项目的优势就是灵活，当你需要什么东西，可以让维护者快速更新发布；但是缺点也是很明显，就是个人的精力和时间十分有限。
有时候用户着急的情绪会体现在标题上，但是其实当我看到  issue 时可能已经是隔天了，而事实上很多 issue 如果对方能稍微花点时间，看看文档或者 issue 模版上的链接，我想可能都不需要等我的回复。

来自俄罗斯的 Astra Linux 是 Debian 的下游发行版，它已经存在了一些年，除了 x86、Arm 等 CPU 架构外，它还支持 MIPS 架构。它是由 RusBITech 开发的，是专门为俄罗斯军队设计的。微软已经阻止了 Windows 在俄罗斯的使用，这似乎大大有助于推动替代操作系统的采用。路透社报道说，RosBITech 正计划在莫斯科证券交易所上市，估值约折合为 2.6 亿美元。

老王点评：我觉得他们比较谦虚，要是搞个根社区可能估值更高呢。




KDE Plasma 5.26 有望使用 C++20 进行开发

在即将到来的 KDE Plasma 5.26 桌面环境中，KDE 开发者正考虑使用 C++20 语言开发后续功能，尤其是使用 C++ 协同例程支持特性。随着时间的推移，这种较新的 C++ 语言也会用于其他 KDE 组件。将 C++ 要求提升到 C++20 意味着将 KDE 编译器要求提高到 GCC 10 或 Clang 11，而这些版本的编译器已经稳定发布两年了。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看来最近各个开源项目都在逐渐迁移到新的语言标准和新的编译器了，这种稳健而进步的态度是开源的生命力。




RISC-V 仅用 12 年达成百亿核心里程碑

在近日召开的 Embedded World 大会上，RISC-V 国际的 CEO 宣布目前 RISC-V 市场上的核心数量已经突破 100 亿。CEO 认为开放标准是关键，“Linux 在为软件所做的事情，和我们为硬件所做的事情有异曲同工之妙。”RISC-V 是一种开放标准指令集架构（ISA），根据开源许可提供。据悉，ARM 架构经过 17 年，在 2008 年实现了这个里程碑。而 RISC-V 只用了 12 年就完成了这一目标。

老王点评：看来 RISC-V 真能复制 Linux 在软件方面的成功啊。</span>

                              <span>学习如何用动态链接库将多个 C 目标文件结合到一个单个的可执行文件之中。




当使用 C 编程语言编写一个应用程序时，你的代码通常有多个源文件代码。

最终，这些文件必须被编译到一个单个的可执行文件之中。你可以通过创建静态或动态库（后者也被称为 共享shared 库）来实现这一点。这两种类型的库在创建和链接的方式上有所不同。两者都有缺点和优点，这取决于你的使用情况。

动态链接是最常见的方法，尤其是在 Linux 系统上。动态链接会保持库模块化，因此，很多应用程序可以共享一个库。应用程序的模块化也允许单独更新其依赖的共享库。

在这篇文章中，我将演示动态链接是如何工作的。在后期的文章中，我将演示静态链接。

链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的数个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名为可执行文件executable的可以运行的程序。在你创建一个动态链接的可执行文件前，你需要一些用来链接的库，和一个用来编译的应用程序。准备好你 最喜欢的文本编辑器 并继续。

创建目标文件

首先，创建带有这些函数签名的头文件 mymath.h ：

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：

                              <span>Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。




Meta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。

现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。

（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）

Meta 试图不落下任何语言




目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。

虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。

因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。

NLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。

正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！

为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。

你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。

对社会事业的鼓励

Meta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。

项目的影响

尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。

许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。

你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？

二十万级别房车——便宜大碗，房的部分空间配置等大幅提升，但车的部分依然拉胯；
三十万级别房车——主流之选，大部分房车消费者选购房车都会考虑的一个价位，不论房的部分还是车的部分都有了实际的提升，但还是存在部分硬伤，比如房的部分不够高级、品质一般；车的部分配置较低、甚至还有手动挡；
而到了四十万这个级别，当房车厂商不用那么严苛地控制成本时，终于出现了许多够实用、够个性、有品质的房车，事实上，这也是房车车型最多的一个价位，可见放开成本的手脚后，房车市场终于可以百花齐放、各显神通。
这篇文章我们就来看看四款这个价位比较有代表性的车型。
一：通过性强、硬升顶：途酷神行太保 （指导价 39.8 万）

​
​
软升顶的房车之前介绍过几款，而硬升顶的房车市面上其实很少，其成本要远高于软升顶结构，在保温、隔热、隔音、安全性等方面都要更强。
途酷这款硬升顶皮卡房车采用五十铃D-MAX底盘，越野能力较出色；外观线条硬朗，采用黑灰配色的磨砂质感外观，升顶后全车尺寸5580x2110x2143mm，降下车顶高度为2060mm，可以通过大部分限高和地下车库。虽然是皮卡底盘，但改装成房车后行驶本上是小型旅居车手续，没有报废年限。车身箱体材料是采用三明治板，升顶为螺杆机构，可以通过遥控来控制升高高度，还能随时暂停；车门在升降过程中也能随时开合。相较于软升顶，硬升顶机构的好处是在较低时速时可以不降下顶棚，坏处是整个结构比较重，使得整车质量达到2742kg。

​
​
车身外侧有配220V电源插座的抽拉式燃气灶台，盖板可以当做操作台使用；另一侧是黑水箱装卸口、尿素加注口、220V市电充电口和储物箱。车头内部还融合了一盏野外探照灯。

底盘方面搭载1.9T柴油发动机，最大功率163马力、峰值扭矩360牛米，配备爱信6AT自动挡，标配分时四驱、定速巡…</span>

                              <span>大家好，我是噩梦飘雷~
今天为大家带来关于家庭装修过程中的网线布局，以及使用mesh组网完成全屋WiFi覆盖的实战教程，全文7000余字，建议收藏后慢慢阅读~
关注我，后续分享更多有趣的内容~
前言
通过站内大佬孜孜不倦的科普，大家已经逐步认识到，对于大平层、跃层、多层别墅等大面积的户型，想要提高家中WiFi信号的覆盖效果，实现WiFi漫游，目前有AC+AP以及MESH组网两种主流方案。
毕竟国家对无线路由器的信号发射功率进行了限制，哪怕是价格大几千的顶级路由，面对多重承重墙和复杂户型，在信号覆盖方面也是巧妇难为无米之炊。
AC+AP方案主要应用在企业级无线组网领域，虽然目前有大厂也推出了家用场景下的AC+AP方案，但是还是存在着诸如必须提前埋布网线，AP面板发热降频、整体价格较高等问题。
相比之下，MESH组网的方式，更适合家用环境。组网方案非常灵活，设置难度较小，性价比更高。特别是对于家中没有预埋网线的情况，MESH组网基本上是实现全屋WiFi覆盖和漫游的唯一选择。
以我自家为例，原本使用华硕AX86U+2个AC66U B1组合的aimesh2.0方案，其中AX86U作为主路由承担PPPOE拨号任务，AC66U B1作为MESH节点负责扩展WiFi信号的覆盖面积。
这套方案实际运行起来挺稳的，但是有个最大问题，华硕aimesh2.0技术在WiFi6和WiFi5路由器混合组网的情况下，无法使用AX86U的WiFi6 160mHz频段，难以发挥出全部性能，感觉实在是浪费。
听群里老哥说过，领势是做了30多年的老牌路由器厂商，一直是MESH技术的开拓者和领头羊，以安装和组网方便著名因此今年趁着618活动，给自家更换成了领势Velop MX2003这套WiFi6的MESH系统。
什么是MESH组网？

MESH的本意就是网状，理想状态下，MESH网络中所有的节点都可以互相连通，…</span>

                              <span>作为小米冲击高端的第 3 年、第 4 个系列，12S 系列凭借着「徕卡影像」的亮点可谓赚足了眼球。我也第一时间到小米之家把玩了真机，虽然质感有进步，但整体的感觉依然很小米，硬件设计依然没有延续性可言，好在高通这代处理器终于把功耗拿捏住了（比去年 11 Ultra 明显发热卡住好太多了）。
不过我今年依然不会选购小米旗舰，因为小米始终没有解决一个问题：R角设计。

声明：我并没有相关的从业背景，所以并不清楚更专业且准确地描述这个问题，只能从普通消费者的角度形容这个问题。如有描述错误，请见谅。

R 角设计是指什么？
R角：R是圆角， Radius，指內圆弧角或外圆弧角。在手机硬件上看 R角设计的好坏时，我会把机身弧角、屏幕弧角放在一起看，因为这本质上就是把圆角放在其他圆角里。
我们先来看看小米12S Ultra 的 R角设计：

很明显，小米12S Ultra 的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率并不连续（有曲面屏的影响），也并非同心圆的关系，两个圆角曲率处有着奇怪的「畸形」。虽然这一代比小米11 Ultra 进步很多，但观感上依然别扭。

而我眼中正确的 R 角设计，代表性的有苹果 iPhone 的全面屏机型、三星S22、谷歌 Pixel 5等，它们的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率连续，且处于同心圆的位置，看起来有秩序且耐看。苹果甚至还把这种「讲究」运用在了软件硬件的结合上，比如 iPhone 全面屏版本界面底部专属的 Dock 栏，以及 Dock 栏的图标与机身机身弧角、屏幕弧角完美呼应：
真的让人感觉十分舒适。图/ carlosnuila
值得一提的是，iPhone 12 系列回归直角边框设计后， 苹果还将该设备上运行的 iOS 版本进行了 R 角微调，即便它和  iPhone X、iPhone 11 系列都是运行同样的 iOS 系统，但机身硬件外观圆角曲率产生了变化，「执拗」的苹果就在软件上准备了两种完全不同的圆角曲率分别与不同机身外观进行更好地呼应。

R 角设计做好，意味着什么？
可能很多朋友会认为，R角的设计无关紧要，只是像我这类的人过于吹毛求疵。
我尊重这个观点，因为多数设备的 R 角设计问题确实没那么重要。比如小米12S Ultra 这款机器整体表现出众，但它硬件设计缺乏的延续性、高端旗舰缺乏的精致感等问题，远比解决 R 角设计重要得多。
但就我个人角度而言，手机是我每天接触最长的电子设备，而且这几年手机迭代升级提升有限，更换周期比以往慢了许多，所以我更在乎手机的外在形象和整体体验。
手机在进入全面屏设计以后，我觉得是一个技术革命的开始，因为它让手机屏幕需要与边框之间的边界进一步缩小，达到一种近似融合的境界。

而优秀的 R 角设计，能让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，让屏幕与外壳间连接更趋向自然，让用户不能轻易感受到边界的存在，完全沉浸其中。反观设计不太好的 R 角，即便也有全面屏设计带来的震撼观感，但日常使用时也总能轻而易举感受到屏幕与外壳两者曲率处存在着奇怪的「畸形」，让技术革命带来的沉浸感始终不够彻底。
让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，这一项看似简单的设计，背后也都蕴藏着大量的技术成本，比如 OLED 屏幕的切割和折叠、电路面板的堆叠技术、圆角处的次像素反走样渲染、严格的界面 UI 设计规范等等。
最后，我很希望后续小米能够重视 R 角的设计，早日推出更棒的旗舰产品。因为我始终觉得，手机进入全面屏时代后，手机同质化越来越严重，最美的「风景」不是莱卡蔡司等相机品牌的联名、不是越来越窄的边框、不是越来越快的快充技术、不是越拍越远的长焦，而是来自 2017 年 iPhone X 那张让人完全沉浸其中的全面屏设计宣传图：

                              <span>背景
现在Omnifocus的收集任务的方式，总体还算方便。
在mac上支持快捷键呼出小窗口快速录入，如下图所示：
Omnifocus的快捷任务窗口
在iPhone上也可以使用Quick Entry快速录入。
长按Omnifocus呼出Quick Entry
按理来说，这些入口完全足够日常的收集，但是我总感觉还差点火候，那就是不够智能。
萌发
为什么会觉得Omnifocus的任务收集方式不够智能呢？因为我自己经常和Siri互动，比如让Siri帮我安排一个日程，手机上，让Siri提醒我安排一个待办事项（可以导入到Omnifocus）。这种自然的文字或语言的交互，让我觉得非常高效和符合直觉。
让我们看看具体的演示
首先一起来看看电脑端安排一个日程
Siri自动根据输入的文字，安排日程
我们可以看到，Siri很智能就识别出了下周二的日期和时间，并帮我添加了一个日程。使用Siri交互，省去了打开日历，选择日期，输入内容的繁琐过程。
然后让我们看看移动端如何使用Siri记录待办事项
通过输入文字和Siri交互SIri完成任务到提醒事项的收集打开Omnifocus自动捕捉系统提醒事项的内容
整体链路如下：

呼出Siri，并输入你的任务
Siri自动识别日期和任务
提醒事项添加到系统中
打开Omnifocus
Omnifocus自动导入系统的提醒事项

要启用Omnifocus的捕捉功能，需要在Omnifocus中做一下简单的配置。
Omnifocus配置自动捕获提醒事项
上面两个Demo都非常好，不过关键问题来了，mac上的Omnifocus不支持导入提醒事项。有朋友可能会想，那很简单啊，手机上打开Siri录入任务，然后导入到Omnifocus同步，mac端的问题不就解决了？
如果在mac上智能录入待办事项，需要用如此冗长的链路，我会选择放弃。实际在电脑工作的时候，面对突然插入的事项，我需要快速记录。一般情况下不会那么悠闲地打开手机去分心记录。
大家都是成年人了，可以全都要吗？可以。
落地
既然全都要，那我来落地一下自己的想法吧。
这个痒点需求自然不能占用我太多时间去处理，经过最偷懒原则出发的摸索，我发现快捷指令，支持提取文本里面的日期和时间。那剩下的问题就非常简单了，我们直接花一点碎片时间写一个快捷指令出来智能收集任务到Omnifocus里面就行了。
感兴趣的朋友可以看看下图，核心原理就是用“记得”为关键字做切割，将带有时间的任务收集到Omnifocus。
写完之后我都懒得看的快捷指令详情
好的，最后让我们看看成果
打开快捷指令的Input弹窗Omnifocus中的收件箱已经安排好时间
通过编写这样的一个快捷指令，让mac端的Omnifocus增加了智能识别时间录入任务的能力。
这个只是我自己在完善Ominfocus工具使用体验的一个小思路。我相信很多的任务管理工具可能已经有很好的语音识别功能，也许你也用不上，但是了解了快捷指令可以智能提取文本中的时间，可能可以给你的工作流带来一定的帮助。
总结
在我自己的工作流沉淀过程中，我比较关心工作本身是否足够流畅且不分心。我会以此为前提去充分探索和优化。至于打磨工具本身，是一个必然会经历的过程。方法论和工具本身没有高下之分，二者不可偏废。我一直提醒自己，不要只了解方法论去盖空中楼阁，更不要在工具细节中忘了自己要去哪里。</span>

                              <span>今年第4号台风艾利于7月1日早晨8点生成，7月2日夜间通过冲绳岛，7月5日登陆日本长崎县附近，随后快速穿过日本本土，于7月6日来到本州岛偏东方向的太平洋上。
但随后，艾利并没有像一般台风那样，飞速东去消散，而是在太平洋上急停逗留了三天，期间还一度增强。我们可以看到，在年轻时秃头的它，在生命的的最后时刻竟然长出了浓密的云系。
它极有可能在7月11日前后第三次袭击日本，登陆北海道或本州北部，带来狂风暴雨。在太平洋的停滞和滞留，正是它再次调转枪口的前兆。而艾利的再次转向，正是勘察加以西、东西伯利亚东南的一个横空

为了不让文章看上去过于枯燥，笔者考虑了一下，特意增加了碎碎谈环节！自从上次这篇文章发出去后  黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！，就挺受读者欢迎的呀，收藏数大于点赞数是什么鬼，嘿嘿！从我的角度出发，本来Signal出发的目的就是想建造一个类似于安全气囊的装置，保证crash后第一时间重启恢复，达到一个应用稳定的目的，但是慢慢写着写着，发现很多crash监控平台的也是用了相同的核心原理（大部分还没开源噢），只是作用的目标不同，那么为什么不把Signal打造成一个通用的基础件呢！无论是安全气囊还是监控，其实都是上层的应用不同罢了！嗯！有了这个想法之后，给Signal补充一些日志监控逻辑，就更加完善了！所以就有了本篇文章！算是一个补充文！如果没看过黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！这篇文章的新朋友，请先阅读！（如果没有ndk开发经验也没关系，里面也不涉及很复杂的c知识）
获取堆栈
获取堆栈！可能很多新朋友看到这个就会想，这有什么难的嘛！直接new 一个Throwable获取不就可以了嘛，或者Thread.currentThread().stackTrace（kotlin）等等也可以呀！嗯！是的！我们在java层通常会有很固定的获取堆栈方式，这得益于java虚拟机的设计，也得益于java语言的设计，因为屏蔽了多平台底层的差异，我们就可以用相对统一的api去获取当前的堆栈。这个堆栈也特指java虚拟机堆栈！
但是对于native的堆栈，问题就来了！我们知道native层通常跟很多因素有关，比如链接器，编译器，还有各种库的版本，各种abi等等影响，获取一个堆栈消息，可没有那么简单，因为太多因素干扰了，这也是历史的包袱！还有对于我们android来说，android官方在对堆栈获取的方式，也是有历史变化的

前言
上一篇介绍了手势在画布上的应用，那么手势与绘制画布究竟能摩擦出怎样的火花呢，本篇文章将为你详解手游中操纵杆移动角色的的原理与实现过程。
基本思路
确定操纵杆区域，确定点击时手势响应区域，当手指滑动操纵杆时，计算出当前的手指位置与当前操纵杆圆心偏移弧度，从而确定当前角色的移动方向。接下来就一步一步实现吧。
绘制
绘制操纵杆的静态图形，玩过手游应该知道操纵杆基本构成由底部圆和手指移动圆球组成，手指移动的圆球围绕底圆进行360°旋转从而控制角色朝不同方向移动。
静态效果
操纵杆的核心是由两个圆形组成，代码也非常简单。

绘制代码：
// 底圆
canvas.drawCircle(
    Offset(0,0),
    bgR,
    _paint
      ..style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.fill
      ..color &#x3D; Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.2));
_paint.color &#x3D; color;
_paint.style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.stroke;


/// 手势小圆
canvas.drawCircle(
    Offset(0,0),
    bgR / 3,
    _paint
      ..style &#x3D; PaintingStyle.fill
      ..color &#x3D; Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.9));

添加手势交互 GestureDetector
大概思路：
当点击可触控区域，将操纵杆移动到当前手指按下的位置，移动手指，根据手指位置坐标和按下时圆心位置坐标计算偏移角度得出手指相对于底圆的坐标点，松开手指，操纵杆进行复位回到初始位置。

继续我们 Flutter 绘图相关的介绍，本篇我们引入一位重量级主角 —— 灭霸。通过绘图的颜色过滤器，我们要给灭霸点颜色看看。通过本篇，你会了解到如下内容：
ColorFilter 颜色过滤器的介绍；
彩色图片转换为灰度图；
通过矩阵运算构建自定义的颜色过滤器。
ColorFilter 颜色过滤器
其实我们之前在给小姐姐的照片调个颜色滤镜有介绍过颜色滤镜，在 Flutter 中提供了一个 ColorFiltered 的组件，可以将颜色过滤器应用到其子组件上。实际上，颜色过滤器就是对一个图层的每个像素的颜色（包括透明度）进行数学运算，改变像素的颜色来实现特定的效果。数学公式如下：

在 Flutter 中，ColorFilter 类的继承自 ImageFilter，像 ImageFilter 一样，也只提供了命名构造函数，一共有四个命名构造函数，分别如下：
ColorFilter.mode(Color color, BlendMode mode)：按制定的混合模式（blend mode），将颜色混入到绘制的目标中。可以理解为图像的色值调整，我们可以用一个指定的颜色调整原图，调整的模式有很多种，具体可以查看 BlendMode 枚举。
ColorFilter.linearToSrgbGamma()：将一个 SRGB 的 gamma 曲线应用到 RGB 颜色通道中。
ColorFilter.srgbToLinearGamma()：ColorFilter.linearToSrgbGamma()的反向过程。
ColorFilter.matrix(List matrix)：应用一个矩阵做颜色变换，也就是我们上面说的矩阵，这是最通用的版…</span>

引子
小u啊，我们应用启动的时候有一段白屏，不雅观，你给整个启动图上去，给，这里是资源图片
换好了
嗯，不错不错，咦，这个小米fold怎么显示了两个logo？
啊？这。。。我来看看
是这样的，activity启动图和启动背景图标一起显示了，但是启动图片又不适配fold这种狭长的屏幕，而且下半部分由于没有背景，是透明的，所以就显示了两个图标，一个启动图标，一个启动图图片图标，请看示意图

那怎么解决呢？
有几个办法，1.让启动图拉伸，覆盖下部分区域，但是会有形变，不够优雅，2.给imageview设置一个白色背景，让它不透明，3.使用android studio的。9图片制作工具，让空白部分拉伸，内容不拉伸，非常优雅。

好，那你先试试.9图片吧
.9简介
我知道看这篇文章的朋友肯定对.9图或多或少有点了解，就简单介绍下就行
.9图可以通过设置来让图片某一部分拉伸 其他部分不拉伸 还可以控制图片里面显示内容的区域
这就是.9图的简介 够简了吧 如果想看更详细的说明可以移步谷歌官方的说明 大体上也是这意思
这个是官方的文档https://developer.android.com/studio/write/draw9patch?hl&#x3D;zh-cn



这是.9图在三种拉伸情况下的例子，纵向，横向，横纵双向。
.9图制作
网上很多文章说最简单是用as内置工具来做 但是网上文章好多都是很早的 都是老版本工具 让我们来看看这工具现在啥样

好像也不是很简单啊 这些东西做什么用的第一次看确实会很蒙，这里介绍下这个工具
Zoom：调整图形在绘制区域中的缩放级别。
Patch scale：调整图像在预览区域中的比例。
Show lock：当鼠标悬停在图形的不可绘制区域上时以直观方式呈现。
Show patches：预览绘制区域中的可拉伸图块（粉色为可拉伸图块），…</span>

Pluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。

Ubuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍

Canonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。

老王点评：总算是又进一步改善了 Snap，虽然还有一些缺陷。




Web3 项目今年前半年因黑客攻击损失超过 20 亿美元

根据一项研究报告，Web3 领域仍然受到黑客、诈骗和网络钓鱼计划的困扰，同时还面临着相对较新的威胁，如闪电贷款攻击。在今年的前六个月，Web3 项目因黑客和漏洞而损失超过 20 亿美元，超过了去年全年。此外，研究还发现，Discord 是绝大多数网络钓鱼企图的载体，这是一个信号，表明它作为 Web3 的首选社交网络仍然很受欢迎，尽管安全问题不断。

                              <span>房车生活是许多人向往的事情，不过一辆优质的房车价格不菲，而且目前房车市场也不像家用车一样可以方便地试乘试驾，因为有全国连锁4S店的房车厂屈指可数。所以当你有迈入房车生活计划的时候，不妨先挑一个假期，先租上几天玩玩，看看房车的驾驶体验和使用体验你能否接受、房车中的诸多不便你能否克服、房车生活是否真的能给你带来更多快乐。
那么最重要的问题来了：怎么租？
一：可信的房车租赁平台
首先是大家都很熟悉的携程，App首页里就有租车频道，很多热门旅游城市都有房车可以选择。​

​
 

​
​​我没在携程租过房车，但在不同城市租过十几次其他车型，总体的服务是满意的，由于有携程平台的监管，租赁公司也不太敢玩套路，而且他们普遍很在乎你在携程的评价，会尽力服务好你，有一次我还车时车身有一条很细的划痕，车商让我给个好评就不用我赔偿了。
但在下订单前最好浏览一下评论，如果差评很多可以换一家车商。
在携程租车的另一个好处是免费取消时间、不同档次的保险费用和权益都会清晰标注，可以按需选择，比如对驾驶有信息，就买个基础险，小事故需要自己理赔；如果技术一般，或者去的地方路况比较差，可以购买全险，出任何大小事故都是由车商处理，很省心。
类似的还有飞猪、马蜂窝等平台。
第二个推荐是上汽大通集团的官方房车租赁平台。
上汽大通是国内比较少见的汽车主机厂原厂改装房车的厂商，实力比大部分房车厂都雄厚。而它也有自己的房车租赁服务平台：“房车生活家租房车”小程序。

​
由于汽车主机厂自营的优势，可以利用其4S店网络进行服务，所以覆盖的城市比较多，而且所租的车型很齐全、车况好，甚至一些特色车型是外面平台租不到的。
这个小程序还可以方便地找到房车营地，基本覆盖了全国主要的房车营地和小车露营地，对于上汽大通合作的营地还可以方便地查看水电、停车收费情况和环境、玩乐项目，非常有心。

​
二：其他平台​
​如果你对自己的鉴别能力有信心，其实也可以尝试在万能的“闲鱼”寻找出租的房车，其实有很多规模很小的租车公司都会在闲鱼发布信息，价格会比在平台上便宜一点，覆盖的城市也更多。​
​但一定要鉴别对方是否有合法的租赁手续，必要时让提供出示营业执照等信息，而且一定要签好合同。
​

​
但​闲鱼的监管作用有限，不推荐没有经验的玩家尝试，在此仅作一个补充渠道供大家参考。
​三：车型怎么选​
​房车类型主要是C型和B型，C型的空间大，装载能力强，配置和储物空间更丰富，适合多人使用，但是驾驶起来不是很方便，比如在城区穿行、停车时都不太灵活，如果开省道、乡道，很多限高杆也会过不去；而B型房车的空间比较小，适合两个人使用，但开起来比较灵活，能通过更多的限高杆。C型车的租金一天在1200-1500元左右，B型车在700-1000元左右。
​如果你对房车的舒适性要求比较高，或者带着一家老小，也可以选择带拓展的房车，驻车时可以获得更大的生活空间，当然，租金方面也会更贵一些。​

​
​四：配置方面要注意什么
​不管你是为了购置房车前先体验，还是为了偶尔出游，租房车时一定要注意所选车型的配置，不然会大幅降低你的房车使用舒适性，进而对房车有所误解。
​最常见的问题就是租赁商没给你提供马桶降解剂、房车电器设施不足、缺乏充电设施。
​很多没接触过房车的人会误以为房车的马桶要自己倾倒未经处理的排泄物，其实房车马桶是要配合降解剂使用的，经过降解后，马桶里的东西就会变成无臭的绿水，不会很恶心（但会有降解剂本身特殊的味道）。
​一些租赁商的房车是低配车，生活电瓶容量很小，逆变器功率也不大，不仅用不了微波炉、电磁炉、空调等大功率设备，而且很快就会缺电，这会大幅降低使用体验，务必要询问清楚电瓶容量和逆变器功率。对于空调，尽量选择有220V车载空调或家用空调的房车，效果会更好。
​有大电池却缺乏充电手段也不行。很多车型只能用底盘车自带的小功率行车发电机、太阳能和外接电进行充电，这三种方式充电效率都非常低，无法满足使用。尽量选择有大功率行车发电和支持快充的房车，前者发动车辆后可以在两三小时内充满电，不心疼油费；后者可以利用现在越来越密布的充电桩充电，当然，不要影响到电动车主的充电哦。​
​其他生活配置大多房车都会配好，比如热水器、暖气、床单被褥等，如果需要用到锅碗瓢盆可以提前问问是否提供，不提供就得自己带上了。​
​其他方面和租赁普通家用车流程是一样的，都要准备好驾照、身份证、预授权的信用卡或支付宝等。</span>

阅读本文需要 3 分钟，安利我的新玩意儿——一台超迷你主机！ 
如果你喜欢本文，就分享给你的小伙伴！

01 需求
最近几年，对电子产品的欲望降低了很多。不过，两个月前，我萌生了弄一台办公小主机的需求。
其实，对于电脑，我一直没有太高的需求，不看 4K，更不玩游戏，最复杂最耗资源的需求，那就是视频剪辑了。
不过，我的视频剪辑需求，也算是非常入门了——只是使用 Camtasia 来完成课程视频的剪辑工作。
之前使用的电脑，都是笔记本：一台 Macbook Pro，一台华为。但因为办公升降桌很小，笔记本 + 带鱼屏往上一放，就更打挤了。
所以，迷你主机的需求，就这样诞生了。之所以需要迷你，是因为我不希望它太占空间，不然还不如继续用笔记本呢。
02 选品
最初，我本打算入手 Mac Mini，下单之前，顺手看了下 MacBuyer&#x27;s Guide（一个提供 Apple 家产品购买建议和指南的网站）：

好家伙，这一代 Mac Mini 已经发布 604 天，而平均更新周期为 634 天，所以，网站直接给打上了” 不要购买 “的标签：

我可不想前脚刚原价购买，后脚就上了新一代产品。所以，果断放弃。
然后，逛张大妈的时候，无意间发现这么个玩意儿：

这玩意儿叫DeskMini，看了一下详细介绍，机箱只有 1.9L，甚至比一瓶拉罐可乐大不了多少，嗯，尺寸似乎正合我意！
但这只是一个机箱 + 主板的准系统，我得自己另行购买 CPU、内存和硬盘。
挑选了一下，粗略计算了个总价，似乎能控制在 3500 以内，ok，下手！

于是，我就这样用上了人生中的第一台迷你组装机。
03 装机
准系统拿下，实际到手价格 909，包含机箱、电源、主板和风扇，另外还有一个无线网卡。
然后查了不少资料，确定下AMD R5600G这款 CPU，散片 1089 拿下！
硬盘不用太大，毕竟我有 NAS 服务器，所以，1TB 的铠侠 NVME 固态，527 拿下！
内存么，之前的电脑都是 16G，剪视频 + 开虚拟机的情况下，有些捉襟见肘，所以，怎么也得上 32G 吧…… 最后，654，拿下两条 16G 镁光 DDR4 3200。
然后，查了一下自带的无线网卡，最高速度 433 Mbps，岂不是让我的 NAS 毫无用武之地？怎么也处上 2.5G 无线网络吧？
好的，AX210 无线网卡安排上！拼多多 75 到手！
所有配件到齐，装机——

不得不说，第一次自己装机，我是真的手残，找了 N 个视频，折腾了两个小时，终于给装上了……

是真的很小，比我 500ml 的茶杯大不了多少，放桌面上毫无违和感。
04 体验
然后，重新整理桌面空间、开机、装上 Win11，常用的软件装上，测试视频编码。
旧的电脑，视频编码 CPU 占用直接狂飙到 100%，这小主机，占用率一起处于 60% 左右。
内存也一直没用到一半。

真香！
甚至，几年不玩游戏的我，还特意下载了 Steam，入手了地平线 5……
没错，集显玩地平线 5！

开低画质（第二档，下面还有极低），挺流畅的，不过没有测试帧率。
到这一步，我只能说：

AMD Yes!

05 再次折腾
用了一周之后，我发现一个严重的问题：

CPU 温度时常接近 70 度。

作为一名完美主义者，这能忍？
所以，我又萌生了换个散热器的想法。
因为主机太小，所以最高仅支持 46mm 的散热器。
所以，103，拿下这个规格的利民散热器！
安装安装安装……

不得不再次吐槽，我手是真的残，换个散热器，又搞了两个钟头……
而且因为底部螺丝拧得太紧，主板都给干弯了……
好了，温度果然下降了好几度，舒服了！
再后来，我又发现，这主机虽小，但扩展性还挺高：居然支持同时插上两块 NVME 硬盘、两块 2.5 寸 SATA 硬盘。
好的，继续拆！
把我闲置的 SATA 固态给装上当下载盘。
不得不说，手残归手残，折腾是真的爽啊！
06 结语
后面又买了一些小玩意儿，汇总一下这次折腾的总费用——

3400 不到的一台小主机，既能满足我办公的所有需求，又满足了自己折腾的欲望，何乐而不为呢？
因为机箱超小的关系，即便淘汰以后，还能做一台 HTPC 或者远程访问主机，多香呀~</span>

                              <span>Lines and basic shapes are the basis of Jochen Gerner’s distinct, almost paradoxical style that’s sometimes referred to as “abundant minimalism.” The French artist, who lives and works between Lorraine and Burgundy, draws birds and dogs that are sparse in form and yet rich in color and texture: checkered patterns overlaid with a chaotic array of markings create a shaggy fur coat, while variegated patches of feathers distinguish the tail from wing or breast.

                              <span>Precision is at the core of Laura Fischer’s practice. Using cotton and linen threads in neutral tones, the Bellingham, Washington-based artist sheaths smooth stones in impeccably exacting grids. She forms the tiny squares and rectangles with a series of knots, mimicking the loom weaving process but working directly on the natural material. Paired together, the sculptures are finished with a twisting rope wrapped around the circumferences and suspended in staggered positions.
A few of Fischer’s pieces are available on her site. More</span>

Sculptural in form to evoke a brooch or other piece of wearable art, the digitally illustrated insects encase gems and vibrant, iridescent body parts within a metallic structure. Symmetrical motifs adorn the wings and shells, adding an extra layer of ornamentation to the otherwise natural subject matter.
With a background in motion design and key art, Vinogradova works with various clients on illustrations and art direction. More</span>

The Free Software Foundation (FSF) started promoting the idea of sharing code way back in 1985, and since then it&#x27;s defended the rights of computer users and developers. The FSF says that the terms &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; are not effective words when classifying software, and instead considers programs either freedom-respecting (&quot;free&quot; or &quot;libre&quot;) or freedom-trampling (&quot;non-free&quot; or &quot;proprietary&quot;). Whatever terminology you use, the imperative is that computers must belong, part and parcel, to the users, and not to the corporations that owns the software the computers run. This is why the GNU Project, and the Linux kernel, Freedesktop.org, and so many ot…</span>

                              <span>如图所示，这满满的一背包现金，是我有生以来第一次摸过这么多钱，大概四十万左右，真的相当有份量。2017 年，我在微博发出这张照片的时候，大家都纷纷羡慕，以为是用来发奖金的，看来少数派是发财了，甚至连银行的营业员都变得十分热情，指望着我多买点理财产品。但实际上，这是我用个人信用担保，借出来的第一笔高额贷款，是用来保障少数派接下来两个月的工资和运营成本。
这可能就是「钱」的双面性，我们不能只用数量和数字来定夺结论，还要知道钱的来源和用法。很长一段时间，都有很多用户问我们：少数派靠什么赚钱，能赚到钱吗？这可能是理想主义之外，大家最关心的话题，我这里具体说说吧。
理想中的内容付费
我们想象中最理想的赚钱方式，当然是「内容付费」，我们从 2013 年就开始给作者发稿酬，从一年 20 万，到现在每年超过 100 万。作者提供有价值的内容，用户为内容付钱，逻辑很简单，但实操非常难。尽管已经十年了，有付费习惯的用户依然是小众群体，而作者分享的内容，也不一定对所以用户都有价值，匹配和触达目标用户的成本也越来越高。
所以我们先尝试推出了「付费栏目」，把聚焦一个领域的系列内容变成付费阅读，跟软件工具结合，涵盖设计、编程、信息等诸多方法论。我们今年也在迭代栏目，比如以年度为单位，从原来的纯内容付费，增加了在线沙龙、实操任务等更丰富的形式。我们的目的是希望通过这些栏目，帮助用户沉淀和成长。但这毕竟是一种逆反人性的学习模式，付费栏目尽管也做了五年，这部分收入也只能占 10%，并且有大部分收入要分给作者和开发者。
这期间，能赚钱的付费内容，大多是普世性的，比如缓解时代焦虑的成功学，刺激底层人性网络小说，但从长期价值角度，我们不想也不善于赚这个钱。所以从赚钱层面，我非常不成功，也冒出过放弃的念头。但总有用户会回来告诉我们，通过学习少数派某个栏目，对它的职场和人生带来了重要帮助，此时我们又更加笃定，要坚持做…</span>

                              <span>Artist Warren King (previously) finds much of his inspiration by wandering through Chinatown in New York City, where he encounters “street musicians, chess players in Columbus Park, vegetable sellers, knockoff handbag vendors on Canal Street, lion dancers during Chinese New Year celebrations,” he tells Colossal. “I’ve been fascinated during my weekly grocery shopping trips by the vibrant, diverse community there, which is so different from the relatively homogenous suburbs where I grew up.”
These passersby become the initial inspiration for the artist’s figurative cardboard sculptures, which consider his Chinese heritage, his parent’s immigration, and what it means to hold a diasporic identity. More</span>

Knowing how much of your disk is being used by your files is an important consideration, no matter how much storage you have. My laptop has a relatively small 250GB NVME drive. That&#x27;s okay most of the time, but I began to explore gaming on Linux a couple of years ago. Installing Steam and a few games can make storage management more critical.
The du command
The easiest way to examine what&#x27;s left for storage on your disk drive is the du command. This command line utility estimates file space usage. Like all Linux tools, du is very powerful, but knowing how to use it for your particular needs is helpful. I always consult the man page for any utility. This specific tool has several swit…</span>

A typical computer keyboard has only about 100 keys on it.
Most keys double up on characters, also called glyphs, thanks to the Shift key. Glyphs are frequently used to type letters with accents and umlauts, to produce characters used in mathematic or monetary expressions, or just to add fun emojis. In some regions there are even three glyphs available on select keys.
Regardless of your region, however, some glyphs don&#x27;t make it onto your keyboard. Fortunately, Linux provides access to these through a compose key.
There&#x27;s no compose key on your keyboard, at least not by default, but you can designate a key you&#x27;re not otherwise using as your compose key. I use the Alt key to t…</span>

我们出产这么一个SDK，目的是给与整个公司的研发部门出具一份前端H5与原生容器的统一交互方案，并使用统一的Web容器，避免各个业务方自行开发容器造成资源浪费。当然，做的就是全平台，包括iOS，Android，Flutter，本文只讲解 Android的设计概要，其他平台部分细节可以类推。
本文将会解析Android侧 容器代码进行详细拆解分析，讲述一个合格的容器库应该具备什么要素。由于由于每个团队每个人都有自己的代码风格和偏好的重点，所以不会涉及到太多具体的代码，只会对设计此SDK的必须要做的事或者强烈推荐做到的细节做出解释。
目标
SDK初始化流程
阅读一个SDK我们通常会从它的Demo入手，让demo运行起来看具体效果。而在代码中，第一个进入视线的就是Application这个类的配置了。一个SDK的初始化代码，在调用方看来应该尽可能简单，而且对性能影响最小化，否则会影响到app的启动速度。
WebView的引入和常用设置
在国内市面上主流的web容器，通常是以X5为内核，本节将讲述X5的常用配置，H5原生混合开发中通常会出现一些莫名其妙的兼容问题，这种问题有的可以通过WebView的 配置来规避掉。
webView与H5的交互流程设计
作为一个H5业务模块的web容器，很多功能要借助原生能力来达成最佳的体验，js与native的交互，我们基本都是以 WebView的 addJavascriptInterface()方法来添加一个nat…</span>

                              <span>一、适配的目的
区别于iOS，android设备有不同的分辨率大小以及不同厂商的系统，目前市场的分辨率可以看下友盟的相关统计。

可以看到主流的分辨率有10多种，当不做适配时，一套代码在不同设备上的效果偏大、偏小、截断以及留白严重，那一套代码如何完美的展示在不同的设备上，可以看下面的一些适配方案。
二、UI适配
2.1、常见的适配方式
2.1.1、xml布局控件适配
避免写死View的宽高，尽量使用warp_content和match_parent；
父布局为LinearLayout，选择使用android:layout_weight属性，为布局中的每个子View设置权重；
父布局为RelativeLayout，可以选择使用layout_centerInParent等属性，设置子View的相对位置；
谷歌官方在之前版本中提供了一个百分比布局方式：support:percent，它支持RelativeLayout和FrameLayout的百分比布局，但是目前官方已经不再维护，而将他取而代之的是新晋布局：ConstraintLayout，ConstraintLayout强大之处不仅在于它能够进行百分比布局，还可以进行相对定位、角度定位、尺寸约束、宽高比、Chainl链布局等，在不同设备间都能处理的游刃有余。
2.1.2、图片适配
.9图
见2.1.4分辨率限定符；
2.1.3、依据产品设计适配
所谓产品设计适配，指的是产品流程在不同设备上有不同的展示方式，例如手机与Pad的区别，在手机设备上，一般来说具体Item列表是一个页面，点击每个Item会跳转至新的详情页；而在宽度&gt;高度的Pad上，为了防止页面空白浪费，一般会要求屏幕左侧为Item列表，右侧即详情页，item与详情页会同时出现在用户的视觉内，如下图

关于这种类型的设计，其实郭霖《第一行代码》给出了一个方案，我在这里抛砖…</span>

前言
背景

之前一直都是使用的Rxjava，响应式编程是真的写起来特别的简洁优雅，而且直观，一个数据流，从发射-&gt;中间的数据转换-&gt;消费一目了然（当然前提是本身使用恰当），其中各式各样的操作符完美覆盖任何场景。但是使用的多了也免不了会发现一些问题，比如debug的时候简直难受，还有对于当前逻辑没有显式的表明是否为子线程，特别在函数调用链长且在不同类的时候，往往要追溯很久等等此类。当然事物本来也无完美之事，我们能做的便是尽力追求完美的事物。
此外便是目前Android也诞生了很多新东西，所以我打算尝试一下，说不定能带来一些新的视角，因为一件新事物的诞生往往是需要解决旧事物的某处不足。
实现

目前WanAndroid公开的Api均已实现，我需要的是一个完美的App而不是充满着TODO项。
介绍
App内通篇全采用Material Design 3风格，拒绝半完成式Material带来的UI的割裂感。
我见多很多WanAndroid的开源客户端，在UI上都不怎么重视，但是如果要是日常使用的App，没有得体的UI我相信很难有使用的动力，而Material Design无疑是最好的选择
所有Icon取自Material Symbols，统一而规范的设计。
主题色遵循Material3 Color system。
PrimaryColor, On-primary, Primary container, On-primary container
SecondaryColor 同上
TertiaryColor
默认主题色采用Material Theme Builder从图片取色而成。
实现Dynamic Colors，开启动态主题色后，App主题色自动跟随系统主题色且适配深色模式，保持一贯的视觉体验(Android 12及以上支持)

前言
有了前面的基础，战机和敌机的环境已经搭建好了。故本文着重记录基于Flame实现飞机大战的战机子弹发射以及基于碰撞检测实现的子弹设计敌机和战机与敌机相遇场景。
笔者将这一系列文章收录到以下专栏，欢迎有兴趣的同学阅读：
基于Flutter&amp;Flame 的飞机大战开发笔记
子弹Component
创建一个继承自SpriteAnimationComponent的类Bullet1作为子弹的实现类。这个和之前的一样都当是一个序列帧处理。
class Bullet1 extends SpriteAnimationComponent with CollisionCallbacks {
  double speed &#x3D; 200;

  Bullet1() : super();

  @override
  Future onLoad() async {
    List sprites &#x3D; [];
    sprites.add(await Sprite.load(&#x27;bullet/bullet1.png&#x27;));
    final SpriteAnimation spriteAnimation &#x3D;
        SpriteAnimation.spriteList(sprites, stepTime: 0.15);
    animation &#x3D; spriteAnimation;
  }    

为了让子弹Component运动起来，沿用之前敌机Component的做法。在其update回调后更新position。
@override
void update(double dt) {
  super.update(dt);
  Vector2 ds &#x3D; Vector2(0, -1) * speed * dt;

                              <span>1、UI自动化测试简介
软件测试简介
​软件测试是伴随着软件开发一同诞生的，随着软件规模大型化，结构复杂化，软件测试也从最初的简单“调试”，发展到当今的自动化测试。
​自动化测试是什么呢？自动化测试是把以人为驱动的测试行为转化为机器执行的一种过程，自动化测试通常会借助某些工具或者框架。虽然不能完全取代手工测试，但相比手工测试来讲，自动化测试可以减少人力成本，降低重复工作，从而更快速、高效的进行测试活动。
​测试金字塔是一种自动化测试过程的金字塔形策略结构，用来指导软件开发过程中各层测试投入的工作量比例，其最早由Mike Cohn在2009年的著作《Scrum敏捷软件开发》中提出。Mike Cohn在书中指出：测试金字塔从上到下分为三层，分别是UI测试、服务/接口测试、单元测试，越接近金字塔底部的测试活动，投入的工作量应该越多，即单元测试投入工作量最多，接口测试次之，UI测试投入最少。

UI测试
​UI测试是最接近软件真实用户使用行为的测试类型。通常是模拟真实用户使用软件的行为，即模拟用户在软件界面上的各种操作，并验证这些操作对应的结果是否正确。
接口测试（API测试）
​API测试，主要针对的是各模块暴露的接口，通常采用灰盒测试方法。首先以黑盒方式设计如何调用API的测试用例，同时在测试执行过程中统计代码覆盖率，然后根据代码覆盖率情况来补充更多、更有针对性的测试用例。
单元测试
​单元测试，属于白盒测试的范畴，通常由开发工程师自己完成，越早发现缺陷其修复成本越低。
为什么要做 UI 自动化？
​随着不停的版本迭代，软件新增功能变的越来越多，对测试资源的需求也变得越来越大，执行人工测试的时间越来越长。对于人工测试的依赖开始变得棘手，因此大家开始寻找解决方案，UI 自动化也应运而生。
人工测试存在以下的弊端：
人工回归测试需要花费很长时间才能完成，很小的延迟就会让发布面临风险…</span>
