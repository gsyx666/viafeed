                    <span>App description needs to be updated to clearly state the source of information and whether the app represents the government entity.
When I first submitted my US Election Info app, I got rejected.

These are the details:
Disclaimer/Source: Missing Clear Source of Information/Disclaimer
So I dug a bit further and found the following requirement:
Requirements for apps that communicate government information
Since my app does not affiliate with any government, I refer to Unaffiliated apps that communicate government information section. There are 2 things that I need to do:
Clearly conveying the sources to users in the app description, and
Making clear that the app does not represent a government or political entity.
I wasn&#x27;t sure, and I googled this a bit. It turned out that I need to update my App description. So I added the disclaimer at the end of the app description.
This is the exact text that I added:
Disclaimer
(1) Information on this app comes from the Google Civic Information API, which aggregates data across the United States on elected officials in federal, state, county and local government offices.
(2) This app does not represent any government or political entity. Your use of this information provided on this app is solely at your own risk.

Please note that you can add link in the app decription using  tag.
This is how the texts look like at the bottom of my app description:

After updating the app description, it gets approved!

Wow time was delivered as fast as CloudFront deliver content 😊 
Around this time last year, I was doubting myself about applying for the Community Builders program. I did some research before applying to give me some comfort. I discovered that the number of applications was huge but that was not the scariest part, the scariest part was to know that only a small selection is accepted.  I told myself well, is it all or nothing so I did it and here I am sharing my story.  
Let me share with you some questions I asked myself about this program and why was I interested in joining this community.  
Why did I want to join this program?

Example 1:
Input: intervals &#x3D; [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
To solve the question click here:(https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
The new thing that I learned in this question is about comparator interface in java. Using a comparator, we can sort the elements based on data members. For instance, it may be on roll no, name, age, or anything else.
In this question, I used comparator to sort the intervals according to the 1st interval.
Arrays.sort(intervals,(o1,o2)-&gt;{

So you will also be able to explore the divergence in those attitudes between Democrats and Republicans. The data originates from the article “COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy: A longitudinal study” published in the Plos One journal.

Along the way, I’ll be documenting and sharing the whole process on IndieHackers and Twitter. This should serve as a motivation for others but aswell for me.
I’m a self-taught developer who learned the wrong programming languages😅. Several years ago, I started to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP. I don&#x27;t regret learning HTML and CSS. However, I regret learning PHP. At the time of learning it, PHP was the future! Now, in 2022 PHP is basically dead! Over the last two years, I have learned Python, Machine Learning, and…</span>

                    <span>A great way to level up any application your building is to create a simple loading animation. Today, we&#x27;re going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.
Of course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we&#x27;re going to worry about creating the actual spinner!

For this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).
We start with just a very simple structure in our html.

  


Tip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.
To create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we&#x27;ll create a keyframe animation called spin:
 @keyframes spin {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
   100% {
     transform: rotate(360deg);
   }
 }

Now, let&#x27;s style our actual spinner!

We created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:
 .spinner {
   height: 100vh;
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
 }

Now, for the actual image:
 .img {
   height: 150px;
   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;
 }

Now we have a working spinner!

                    <span>Introduction


Node js is a popular backend nowadays! It&#x27;s fast and easy to write code. If you already know javascript, it can be easy to write node js. So we&#x27;re going to explore express js today with MongoDB for the database. We&#x27;ll create the rest API endpoints and implement CRUD operation for the to-do list. The example is quite basic, but we&#x27;re going to make a good project structure so that you can follow it for your other projects too! Let&#x27;s dive in -
Vscode: I&#x27;ve used the vscode for the whole development!
Node js: I&#x27;ve used node js v14.8.0
MongoDB compass: I&#x27;ve used MongoDB v1.30.1 to see all changes in MongoDB graphically
Postman: We&#x27;ll use this one to test all our api&#x27;s

                    <span>As a web developer, I sometimes describe my job as &quot;making things talk to each other over the internet.&quot; HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, makes this possible. In other words, HTTP is a method of sending messages from one program to another using the internet. 
In this article, I&#x27;ll cover HTTP terms, tools, and the structure of HTTP messages. I use analogies and metaphors, and explain things in multiple ways to try and provide helpful mental models. I&#x27;m currently working on A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to HTTP - Part 2: an App and a Server, in which I&#x27;ll dig into how to write the code to generate HTTP messages. After that, in A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to HTTP - Part 3: APIs, we&#x27;ll have a little fun with our app and some free to use APIs that other people have built for us.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s first see what Types are in Typescript.


Types are the easy way to refer the different properties and functions available to a value in the Typescript Code.
For eg: A vehicle of type Bike had certain properties such as two wheels whereas a vehicle of type Car has four wheels in general.
It is the code we add to the Typescript to make the compiler aware of the type of values variable will refer to.
let age : number &#x3D; 20;
let name: string &#x3D; &quot;Himanshu&quot;;
let isAdult: boolean &#x3D; true;

In the example above, we explicitly tell the typescript compiler that the variable age will be of type number, name will be of type string and isAdult would be of type boolean.
let likes : number &#x3D; 100;
let title: string &#x3D; &quot;Type Annotations and Inference&quot;
let isPublished : boolean &#x3D; true;

In this article, we are going to use what we&#x27;ve learned about HTML so far to create a portfolio, which you can use to tell the world about you and your projects. Without further ado, let&#x27;s get started.
First, create a work folder. This is what I did:

Everything related to the portfolio is inside the Portfolio directory. You can do this differently, but remember to be organized because we are going to add quite a few things in the future.
Next, go to Portfolio and create an HTML file. Let&#x27;s call it &quot;portfolio.html&quot;. Open it with a text editor, you can use the notepad that comes with your operating system if you want, but I recommend using a proper code editor like VS Code.

                    <span>Being a Developer Advocate is by far the best job in the world, at least in my opinion and for me. It isn&#x27;t for everyone and that&#x27;s ok too. There have been many posts written about what is a Developer Advocate and many twitter spaces on how to get into DevRel so I won&#x27;t go into that in this post but link and embed some great resources at the end of the post that will help you if you are looking to get into DevRel or have just started your role as a Developer Advocate and don&#x27;t know where to start.
In this post I am going to share a bit about what I do as a Developer Advocate and what I love about it but it doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to have all these skills to be a Developer Advocate because
everyone is different and everyone brings different skills to the table.

                    <span>Introduction


In HTML, if you want a textbox with some initial text you wrap text inside the textarea tag like this  Hello World , this is fully editable, but if you try this in react you will get an error. Trying to use the defaultValue prop in react won&#x27;t work either. if you add a value prop to the textarea the value of the text will be displayed but then it won&#x27;t be editable, this is because the value prop is immutable.
Passing a value prop to textarea like this  , will display the text Hello World on the textbox, but it won&#x27;t be editable to make it editable we need to pass the a state to the value prop and update that state with the onChange prop like the code below.
import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

function TextBox () {

    const [text, setText] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;Hello World&#x27;);

   return (
            setText(e.target.value) }&gt;
          
         );

}

export default TextBox;


Inside the TextBox component, I initialize the text state with &#x27;Hello World&#x27; and passed it to the textarea as a value prop, this will be the initial text displayed in the text area. onChange&#x3D;{(e) &#x3D;&gt; setText(e.target.value) } this line of code updates the text state, with the new value.

console.log(count++)


....it&#x27;s...

0


 
The pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increment (or decrement) their operand by 1, and the value of the expression is the resulting incremented (or decremented) value.
Let&#x27;s look at what&#x27;s going on &quot;under the hood&quot;.
Here is a representation using a JavaScript class object.
postAdd &#x3D; {count++}
class Counter {
  constructor (){
    this.count &#x3D; 0
  }
  postAdd(){
    let oldCount &#x3D; this.count;
    this.count+&#x3D;1;
    return oldCount
  }
  preAdd(){
    this.count +&#x3D; 1;
    return this.count
  }
}

let count &#x3D; new Counter();

console.log(count.postAdd()) // 0

console.log(count.preAdd()) // 2 (the first console.log still increments!!!)


{variable}++ can be used when you don&#x27;t reference the increased variable in that function call and ++{variable} is useful when you need to reference the incremented variable immediately. -Zach Stone
Technically, pre incrementent is also faster since it is not creating a new variable each time.
I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below.

                    <span>Object-oriented programming is a programming paragdigm that relies on the concept og objects. 
They are three types of methods in python:
Instance method
Class methed
Static method
Instance method is the most comman type of method used in python class. To call an instance method, you need to create an object of the class and with the help of that object you can access instance method.
On other hand, both class method and static method can be accessed directly by using class name i.e without creating object of class. Though you can also access these methods using object of a class.
Class and Static methods have some basic differences. Let&#x27;s have a look over the difference between class and static method.
A class method is a method which bounds to class rather than object or instance of the …</span>

                    <span>最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。
但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。

一、带宽进化的历史
我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。
56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。

我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。
后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。
21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。

ADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。
2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。

从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。
二、家庭的入户带宽
现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。

                    <span>5 年后，Slackware 发布大变样的 15.0

Slackware 是最古老的仍在维护的 Linux 发行版。它的上个版本是 2016 年发布的 14.2。作为一个古老的发行版在五年后发布的 版本，这个版本中有了大幅变化：提供了 5.15.19 LTS 内核；采用 PipeWire 替代了 PulseAudio；X11 之外还提供了 Wayland；用 Qt5 替换了 Qt4；采用 PAM 替代了纯 shadow 密码方式；Postfix 默认替换了 Sendmail；Dovecot 替换了老的 imapd 和 ipop3d；elogind 替换了 ConsoleKit2；带有 Rust 和 Python 3；独有的包管理器 pkgtools 有了很大改进；桌面环境提供了 Xfce 4.16 和最新的 Plasma 5；主要的编译器是 gcc-11.2 和 llvm 13.0；默认浏览器是 Firefox 91.5esr。并且，完全没有 systemd。


老王点评：简直是一夜之间告别过去，重新粉饰新家。明天我们或许会详细解读一下。




一半的英特尔芯片漏洞是员工内部发现的

英特尔在其 年度安全报告 中指出，在 2021 年发现的 226 个 CVE 漏洞中，有一半是英特尔员工在内部发现的，其余 113 个 CVE 中，有 86% 是通过他们的 Bug Bounty 计划从外部发现的。77% 的漏洞存在于硬件/固件中，70% 的英特尔软件安全问题是外部研究人员发现的。漏洞最多的产品是他们的图形硬件/驱动程序，其次是以太网产品和其他软件。最后，他们将 CVE 数量与 AMD 进行比较，英特尔在 2021 年称其 CPU 只有 10 个 CVE，而 AMD 共有 31 个；在图形类方面，AMD 在这一年有 27 个 CVE，而英特尔有 51 个。


老王点评：虽然这些年英特尔 CPU 出现了许多严重漏洞，但是看起来他们还是相当重视的。




Mozilla 关闭了其 VR 浏览器 Firefox Reality

这个开源浏览器允许用户通过单独的 VR 和 AR 头盔访问网络，用户可以访问标准的 URL，进行搜索，并最终在 2D 网站和沉浸式网络体验之间移动。Mozilla 解释 说，它决定关闭 Firefox Reality 的原因是计划将该技术放到其他社区和组织中，这样它就可以“像 WebAssembly、Rust 和 Servo 一样继续发展并为网络作出贡献。”


老王点评：在这个元宇宙大热的时间，Mozilla 却砍掉了其开源的 VR 浏览器，这是对自己的产品能力没有信心吗？</span>

                    <span>这并不是微软所承诺的……但也不全是坏事。




2007 年 1 月 30 日，也就是 15 年前，一再延期的 Windows Vista 发布了。

我们可以尽情地谈论 Vista 有多糟糕、人们有多讨厌它。它是有史以来最不受欢迎的版本之一，与 Windows ME 一样。但是，你今天运行的随便哪个现代 Windows，它都是 Vista 的后裔。

Vista 并没有微软像 2000 年承诺的那样，Windows “Whistler” 将合并 Windows 9x 和 Windows NT：这变成了 XP，每个人都记得 XP —— 基本上都是怀念。Windows Blackcomb 是 XP 的计划中的继任者。它从未面世。我们得到的是 Windows Longhorn。

Blackcomb 将有一个新的编程模型、一个新的用户界面，以及一个新的数据库驱动的存储引擎，“WinFS”……但它被延期了，然后被删除，最后被取消。

谈论 Vista 到底是什么更有意思。摆上货架的是技术上更保守的东西。

它有用户访问控制（UAC）：那些恼人的弹出式信息不断要求获得你的许可。（这实际上是微软意识到大部分的 Windows 机器都是独立的，没有连接到域。）

它有一个 3D 合成的用户界面，“Aero”，带有透明效果，尽管这确实使它变得有点慢。而当 Windows 7 推出时，人们很喜欢它 —— 所以微软将它从 Windows 8 中剥离了。（指的是外观，而不是合成过程；那仍然存在）。

它有一个包含“小部件”的侧边栏，这在 Windows 11 中又出现了。

尽管它在五年前就被干掉了，但 Vista 是 Windows 7 的基础。Vista 是 NT 的第 6 版；而 Windows 7 则是 Windows NT 6.1。

Windows 7 是经过调整的 Vista，响应速度更快。Windows 8 则是 Vista 2：是 Vista 的平板电脑版（它实际上相当不错）。

困难在于，人们已经习惯了台式机和鼠标，所以开始按钮又被迅速恢复了。Windows 8.1 则是 Vista 2.1。

Windows 10 是 Vista 3，Metro 现代应用程序被搁置，桌面应用程序再次成为中心。现在，Windows 11 删除了所有那些讨厌的、复杂的、混乱的东西，如垂直侧边栏。

Vista 是微软放弃其花哨的技术野心而开始简化事物的时候。现在有远见的人已经离开了。Surface 并没有彻底改变这个行业，它只是疏远了 OEM 厂商。

15 年过去了，微软仍在对 Vista 进行迭代。

                    <span>Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是离线学习和新的教育应用程序，为学校和学生提供帮助。




Zorin OS 16 是 2021 年最令人印象深刻的发行版之一。你或许想先了解一下 Zorin OS 16 和 Zorin OS 16 精简版 的信息。

现在，经过一段时间，Zorin OS 团队终于决定发布 Zorin OS 16 教育版。

可以预期包含 Zorin OS 16 的所有改进，以及为教育而量身定做的具体修改。

请注意，教育版的 Zorin OS 16 是完全免费下载的。对于旧电脑，你还可以使用精简教育版。

Zorin OS 16 教育版有什么新内容？

Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是以离线为先的学习体验。换句话说，它包括一个合格的教育内容集，不需要上网就可以访问。

为了实现这一目标，Zorin OS 16 包括了 Kolibri，这是一个自由开源的教育解决方案，支持自定进度的学习，并通过本地 Wi-Fi 网络进行同步/共享。

因此，即使没有互联网，你也可以依靠点对点的连接来分享教育内容，进行协作，并继续学习，不受任何干扰。

学校管理者还可以创建自己的课程，并从可汗学院、Open Stax、麻省理工学院等来源下载现成的资源。

当然，管理员需要互联网接入才能做到这一点。但是，一旦你下载了内容，就可以在没有互联网接入的情况下轻松地在本地网络上分享，从而使分发教育内容成为可能。

除了 Kolibri 之外，Zorin OS 16 还出炉了新的教育应用程序，其中一些是：

Minder：将想法和笔记可视化



与 Obsidian 和 Logseq 类似，Minder 是一个更简单有效的思维导图工具，帮助你将笔记和想法可视化，而进行头脑风暴会议。

Foliate：电子书阅读器



Foliate 是一个令人印象深刻的 Linux 电子书阅读器应用。它应该能让学生/教师提高阅读体验，也能在需要时提供公共领域书籍的下载。

OpenBoard：交互式白板



我最近报道了 OpenBoard，作为我们的应用亮点之一。它是一个自由开源的白板，应该会让老师和学生也感到有趣。

OpenBoard 应该有助于通过工具以及应用程序与多媒体内容互动的能力来改善学习过程。

Minuet：音乐教学

Minuet 专注于帮助你向学生教授音乐。你会发现视觉队列，以及和弦、音阶等方面的练耳练习。

其他改进措施

根据你的系统配置，可以选择 Zorin OS 16 教育版或 Zorin OS 16 精简教育版。

这两个教育版应该会带来更快、更漂亮的桌面体验，可以访问更多的应用程序。

Zorin OS 16 教育版支持到 2025 年 4 月。

你可以从其官方网站下载 Zorin OS 16 教育版及其精简版。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

10 分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
「和危险的动物接触」之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需…</span>

@潘誉晗 ：故事围绕着北方某城市「光字片」里一户周姓人家展开。七十年代末，为了响应国家的号召，父亲前往西南参加「大三线」的建设；长子则成为第一批下乡的知青；长女周蓉生性喜欢浪漫，偷偷前往心上人所在的贵州乡村下乡。不如哥哥姐姐般优秀的老幺，则在家中与母亲相依为命。之后五十年，他们的故事将与祖国发展紧紧相连。
那边的《开端》迎来了开年「第一炸」，这边的《人世间》也我们献上了中国普通老百姓的生活史。剧集改编自梁晓声同名小说，电视剧版汇聚了强大的阵容。由曾执导过《人民的名义》的李路导演，旁白由陈道明担任，主演则有雷佳音、辛柏青、宋佳等演技派的演员。在时…</span>

10 分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
「和危险的动物接触」之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需…</span>

                    <span>Mortal Kombat 11 was one of the big AAA launch titles for Stadia, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten many since then. 
With game publishing becoming increasingly consolidated, Google has apparently changed tactics. A new report claims almost all of Google&#x27;s work on Stadia revolves around licensing the technology. If true, Stadia&#x27;s days as a consumer-facing platform are numbered.

Today’s post will look at another theorem that gives more specific information about the spacing of the zeros. Kneser’s theorem […]

                    <span>Using a websocket server is a great way to speed up your applications. APIs inherently come with their own HTTP overhead, which means every time you call an API, you have to wait a little bit for the HTTP response.
This is mostly fine, but if you have an application with a lot of time sensitive and frequent server requests, it can become a problem. A good example of this is a chat app, where you need to see what the other person is saying immediately. APIs can still work in this scenario, but it&#x27;s not the best solution for the job.
In this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up a websocket server in Vue.JS, using a websocket server built in Node.JS and express. Keep reading for more. I&#x27;ve also written another tutorial on how to create a websocket server in Express and Javascript here.…</span>

                    <span>Before going into what Git and Github is, lets go over version control systems and it&#x27;s appliction to the tech space. VCS is short for Version control system, it is a Version management system that tracks changes in files along with the order in which the changes to these files were made.

Git is an example of a Version control system (VCS), it allows you track all versions of your work and stored as repositories or repos for short. Github is different from Git, but since they are used side by side it is often confused for Git. Github is more like a shared hosting platform for all repositories and applies Git for effective collaboration within organizations and developers. Git hub provides good features for collaboration, one of this features is forking.

                    <span>Introduction


This is part of the UI Kit with React, TypeScript, Storybook and Tailwind, make sure you&#x27;ve checked out the previous entries in the series if you find anything confusing 😊.
In this series I aim to implement a basic text field and integrate it with Storybook.
Let&#x27;s start off by creating what&#x27;s necessary for the text field. I want my text field to support the basics of a simple text-input field. It should support being disabled, having a placeholder and so on. On top of that I want it to integrate with react-hook-form as that is one of my favorite form libraries for React.
In the end, I want it to look like this:

In the project, create the files:
src/components/TextField/TextField.tsx
src/stories/TextField/TextField.stories.tsx
First, we&#x27;ll create the necessary structure for…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s take a look at (what I think) is going to be one of the coolest parts of the upcoming React 18 release: startTransition. 
In a nutshell, startTransition is a new API in React 18 that&#x27;s going to allow us to keep our applications interactive and responsive, even while big updates are happening behind the scenes. Previously, if a user was to initiate an action that would trigger a component to update – such as a search that fetches a ton of new data to display – the whole page would just kind of hang while all that loading stuff was happening. This, as you can imagine, feels kind of awkward to users, so as developers we were forced to find other ways around it – skeleton UIs to make loads feel faster, debouncing, setTimeouts, etc. 
In React, all updates are rendered equally urgently – o…</span>

                    <span>Note: This is the first part of a 3 part series in which we&#x27;ll understand the transform property of CSS.
In this part, we&#x27;ll understand the value &#x27;rotate&#x27; of the transform property.
The transform property is most commonly used in animations as it allows us to do a ton of things such as moving an element, scaling it, rotating it etc.
There are 5 types of &quot;rotate&quot; in the transform property:
1. transform: rotate();
2. transform: rotateX();
3. transform: rotateY();
4. transform: rotateZ();
5. transform: rotate3d;

Let&#x27;s understand them one by one by applying these values on the below👇code:

Sharing Access, a non profit based in West Philly, and working on converting the surplus (5 million pounds) food that is often thrown out or goes to waste in one way or another and delivering that to local nonprofits and food pantries. 
They are approaching this problem in a unique way using open source using React to managing the operations in a PWA. 
The non-profit ecosystem in the USA is a $390 billion (based on 2016 numbers), but despite number operations and technical help can be lacking in the web interactions.

                    <span>AI 参加编程竞赛，成绩超过了一半的程序员

DeepMind 刚刚宣布了其最新打造的 AlphaCode 编程 AI。它参加了 Codeforces 的编程挑战，这是一个极具挑战性的编程平台，通过类似于国际象棋的 Elo 评级系统来分享每周问题和相关排名。最终 AlphaCode 针对 Codeforces 网站上 5000 名用户解决的十个挑战项目开展了测试，且拿下了平均名次位于前 54.3% 的成绩。DeepMind 估计该系统的 Codeforces Elo 为 1238，位居过去 6 个月在该网站上发起挑战的用户榜单的前 28% 。


老王点评：看来至少有一半的程序员可以考虑改行了。




树莓派操作系统发布 64 位版本

虽然 2016 年发布的树莓派 3 及后来的产品已经带有 64 位 CPU，甚至树莓派 Zero 2 也具有 64 位功能，但官方提供的树莓派操作系统一直是 32 位的。不过，64 位的操作系统可以支持更多内存，较新的指令集也有性能优势，此外，一些基于 Arm 的商业/二进制分发软件只支持 AArch64，因此树莓派基金会决定提供 64 位的树莓派操作系统。


老王点评：终于升级到 64 位了，虽然之前可以使用其他的 64 位操作系统。




Oracle Linux 出现在 Windows 商店

Oracle Linux 8.5 是 CentOS 8.5 的衍生发行版，以 WSL 的形式出现在 Windows 商店，这是红帽家族的发行版 首次 出现在 Windows 商店，尽管 Oracle Linux 不是红帽的。在 Windows 商店中，如果你搜索 Linux，你会发现 Ubuntu、SUSE/openSUSE、Debian、Kali、Alpine 等等，这都是为 WSL 开发的。但你不会看到 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL 之类的红帽系的 Linux，虽然有人为 WSL 中制作了 Fedora remix。


老王点评：我就说 Oracle Linux 是叛徒，对吧。</span>

                    <span>Nitrux 2.0.0 是一个令人兴奋的版本，它默认采用 XanMod 内核，并 带来了其他各种视觉和技术改进。




Nitrux Linux 轻松成为了 最漂亮的 Linux 发行版 之一。

上个月，我们点评了 Maui Shell，它也是由 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队所设计的。现在，Nitrux 2.0.0 已经发布，并带来了一些令人兴奋的变化。

让我在这里重点介绍一下基本变化。

Nitrux 2.0.0 有什么新东西？

这次升级包括一个新的 Linux 内核、更新的应用程序、桌面环境、固件改进，以及大大减小了 ISO 的大小。

你还会注意到布局和顶部面板等几处细微视觉变化。

XanMod 内核 5.16.3



XanMod 内核是为新一代硬件量身定做的，以获得尽可能好的桌面体验。

与许多其他 Linux 发行版中自带的 Linux 内核相比，你会发现它有一些自定义设置和新功能，可以提高你的使用体验。

在 Nitrux 2.0.0 中，默认选择了 XanMod 内核 5.16.3。当然你仍然可以选择最新的主线 LTS 或非 LTS（5.15.17、5.16.3）Linux 内核。

别忘了，如果你需要，你还可以安装 Liquorix 和 Libre 内核。

更新布局和面板的变化

顶部面板现在显示了窗口控制、标题、全局菜单和系统托盘区。

布局仍然与以前的版本相似，但有一些位置的调整，比如将应用程序菜单添加到基座dock中，应用程序菜单是 Launchpad Plasma（感谢 adhe）。



此外，你应会发现窗口装饰有了改进，所有窗口现在默认都是无边框的。你可以在外观设置下的窗口装饰选项中选择禁用无边框窗口模式。

可选的 Latte 布局也得到了更新，包括窗口控制、标题栏和全局菜单。

更新的软件包和驱动程序

出于显而易见的原因，这次升级包括 KDE Plasma 版本更新、KDE 框架、KDE 装备，以及其他必要的应用程序，如 Firefox 和 LibreOffice。

此外，为 AMD GPU 增加了内核软件包中没有的额外固件。他们还在可下载的 ISO 中增加了 i915、Nouveau 和 AMDGPU 驱动。

默认使用的是 MESA 21.3.5 稳定版，但如果你需要的话，可以安装最新的 MESA 22.0。

其他改进

在 Nitrux Linux 的这些变化之外，还有一些额外的技术改进，如：


减少了标准版和精简版的 ISO 文件大小。

Xbox One 控制器的工作原理与操纵杆没有冲突。

在精简版 ISO 中，JWM 取代了 i3 窗口管理器。


更多细节，你可以参考 官方公告。

                    <span>Containers are run in the cloud. That&#x27;s because container technology allows websites and web apps to spawn fresh copies of themselves as demand increases. They&#x27;re the reason hundreds of millions of people can use popular sites without those sites buckling under the pressure of global traffic. Containers are a Linux technology, meaning that they rely on code (specifically cgroups and namespaces) unique to the Linux kernel, so when you run a container, you&#x27;re running Linux.

今天 Dart  2.16 跟随 Flutter 2.10 正式发布，它不包含新的语言特性，但有一堆错误修复（包括对安全漏洞的修复），改进了 Dart 包在特定平台的支持，以及 pub.dev 的全新搜索体验。
Dart 2.16
今天与 Flutter 2.10 一起发布的 Dart 2.16 SDK 继续从传统的 Dart CLI 工具（dartfmt、dartdoc 等）过渡到新的组合 dart 开发工具，新的弃用工具是 dartdoc( use dart doc) 和 dartanalyzer (use dart analyze)。
在 Dart 2.17 中我们计划完全删除 dartdoc、dartanalyzer 和 pub 命令（在 Dart 2.15 中已弃用；使用 dart pub 或者 flutter pub）。有关详细信息请参阅#46100。
2.16 版本还包括了一个安全漏洞的修复和两个小的重大更改：
dart:io  中的 HttpClient API  允许为 authorization、www-authenticate、cookie 和 cookie2 设置可选标头，Dart 2.16 之前的 SDK 中重定向逻辑的实现存在一个漏洞，当跨域重定向发生时，这些 headers（可能包含敏感信息）会被传递，在 Dart 2.16 中这些 headers 被删除了。
dart:io 中的 Directory.rename API 已更改了在 Windows 上的行为：它不再删除与目标名称匹配的现有目录（#47653）。

欢迎来到 Flutter 2.10 稳定版本的更新，自上次发布至今还不到两个月，但即使在这么短的时间内，Flutter 2.10 也关闭了 1,843 个 issues，合并了来自全球 155 位贡献者的 1,525 个 PR，所以非常感谢大家这段时间出色的工作，尤其是在 2021 年假期期间。
作为此版本的重要组成部分，这里有几件令人兴奋的事情要宣布，包括：
Flutter 对 Windows 支持的重大更新；
一些关于性能方面的重大改进；
关于对框架中图标和颜色相关的新功能支持；
一些开发工具方便的改进；
此外还有一些关于移除 dev channel 的更新、减少对旧版 iOS 的支持以及简短的重要变更列表等等。
为 Windows 上的生产应用做好准备
首先，Flutter 2.10 版本给我们带来了稳定版本的 Windows 支持，现在开发者可以不再通过设置 flag 来启用 Windows 的支持，因为在 Flutter 2.10 上现在默认支持编译生成 Windows 应用

当然，此版本还包括对文本处理、键盘处理和键盘快捷键相关的改进，以及更好地和 Windows 进行集成，支持命令行参数，全球化多语言文本输入和辅助功能等等。
有关 Windows 稳定版发布的更多信息，请参阅Flutter for Windows 博客文章，该文章描述了 Flutter 在 Windows 上的架构实现，让你了解目前有多少 Flutter 包和插件已经支持 Windows，你还可以查看我们的工具和应用合作伙伴在 Windows 上使用 Flutter 所做的一些 Demo！

@黎明前线 Alan：微软海洋环保鼠标
在微软去年的 Surface 新品发布会之后，就一直对这个号称「环保」、由海洋回收塑料瓶制成的树脂材料蓝色鼠标印象深刻。去年年底终于得偿所愿，入手了这款微软海洋环保鼠标。

撇开同样被微软设计成为方便残障人士开启的环保鼠标包装盒（暂且先不考虑残障人士会不会买这款鼠标），就鼠标本身来讲，微软海洋环保鼠标其实是让我非常失望的：首先就是堪称渲染图诈骗的实际鼠标颜色：实际观感鼠标更加淡灰色，黑色颗粒也会更加明显（但手感上没有区别）。

上面就是官方渲染图 &amp; 实际颜色效果（我已经将室内光源调整至最冷的模式，仍然比官方渲染图中那个洁白无瑕的颜色深了不少）。以至于在上手这款鼠标之后有朋友嘲笑：「你的鼠标是买洗衣粉送的吗？」，我的第一反应其实是「这个形容太准确了！」。

这款鼠标的手感更不值一提：鼠标本身很小巧，重量适中，如果你的手掌像我一样足够大的话可以手本身不移动就覆盖到整片屏幕操作，不过鼠标材质本身质感基本于一般廉价塑料鼠标无异，如果它的配色是纯黑色我的心理预期价位可能只有 ¥50。

所以不要期待太多：它的质感很廉价，闪闪放光芒的指示灯让我梦回初中电脑机房的双飞燕，手感当然也无从谈起，不能调节 DPI、没有辅助功能按键，它只是一个用普通 AAA 电池供电的普通小鼠标而已。
就是这样，即使价格已经很低（当然是相对于微软自家其他外设而言），但综合体验下来，微软海洋环保鼠标的体验大概是其他品牌百元价位鼠标的体验。真要说优势的话，大概还是它的设计我仍然很中意：这也…</span>

谜宫·如意琳琅图籍

推荐人数：1 人
上手难度：★★☆☆☆
欢乐指数：★★★★☆

这是一款由故宫博物院出品的单人解谜桌游，玩家需要借助 app、紫禁城地图、宣纸等各种道具来解开《如意琳琅图籍》里的秘密。桌游的整体设计和做工都与古籍相仿，让人难免有一种「穿越时空，发现秘密」的错觉。《谜宫·如意琳琅图籍》结合了精心设计的谜题和剧情，每一个谜题都能与剧情对应，让玩家体验层层深入、抽丝剥茧的乐趣。
对了，《谜宫·如意琳琅图籍》最后的隐藏谜题，甚至还需要亲自前往故宫博物院来完成，代入感可以说是非常强了。除了《如意琳琅图籍》外，《谜宫》系列还出过一款《金榜题名》的单人解谜桌游，同样值得一试。
漫威绝密档案

推荐人数：1 人
上手难度：★★☆☆☆
欢乐指数：★★★☆☆

这是一款由漫威授权的互动解谜桌游，与《谜宫·如意琳琅图籍》来自同一个团队。在游戏中，你将化身神盾局特工在漫威宇宙里通过解谜来化解危机。桌游内附属了大量文件资料、解谜装备，你需要通过结合手机 app 提供的剧情，合理运用这些道具，找到最后的真相。
对于漫威粉丝来说，这款桌游里藏着大量彩蛋，比如《蜘蛛侠》里的号角日报、《钢铁侠》里的 Stark Expo 门票等，甚至还有英雄们的个人档案。这些内容无疑让整个桌游更具代入感，如果你是漫威粉丝，相信这款桌游会给你带来不一样的解谜体验。

                    <span>今天是大年初三，第四集，先给大家拜个年。
几集播完，引发的一波波舆论有我们想到的、没想到的，千言万语化作一句话“咱老李啥时候有过这热度？”也许是我们一路来收到太多关于老李的负面言论，这么一下子我们都有些不适应。不过还请珍惜雪儿的独角戏。
另一方面从我个人而言，受邀来此只为了和大家分享，我会很认真的对待，有些评论虽然言语激烈但是说的在理，忠言逆耳再难听也得听着，听完还得寻思寻思，反手再说句谢谢。但对于那些只为发泄的言论，只能表示理解。
回归正题！先给大家放几张图。

当时我们寻思疗伤这事儿咋样能好玩有看点，又不能太肆意妄为，因为事儿赶着事儿，不能太放纵喽。所以感谢舒导啊，强烈建议美人出浴搞点福利，并带着我反复研究学习女神塞隆著名的某广告，最终成功被删减，不过万幸，没有全部删掉。

这些则是最后一场戏的删减，其实还好，只是删了特写和全景中尸体的数量，无非是最后的冲击力少了些。但难受的是我们“有始有终”的巴也，他的死亡特写删掉替换成破损的单钺，我怕有人误会他跑了，其实没有，他走了，还走得特别不安详doge，他的死状请记住，死的方式很有特点，会是谁的功法呢~
再说说最后一场戏巴也率人追来，不知道大家觉得压迫感如何，那场戏的气氛灵感来自英剧《浴血黑帮》，几个身着黑衣面容阴郁的挺拔男子，伴随着身后工厂的滚滚蒸汽大步行来，让我备受震撼。



再有个有意思的就是，姬如雪被巴也一脚跺晕，一开始踩的是肚子，但总感觉从构图到反应都不够冲击力，于是略作调整后，看到这里的同事无不以“卧槽”开头，尤其是磊哥，“卧槽！这TM都踩胸上了！”巴也这脚踩的有多狠，他后面走的就有多刺激。
最后再跟大家唠唠这一集最精彩的段落，姬如雪的“鸿门宴”。
不知道有没有小伙伴看过上映前，有一个叫“兖州大殿”的场景PV。那里面都是我们一开始的设想，偌大的破败古庙，两侧监国锦衣持刀而立，行注目礼，压力直给。那是美好的设想，压迫感是来了，但最后要是无双也太没意思（其实就是人多拍不起）。于是我们加入了巴也四徒（四人面具是喜怒哀乐，有看出来的嘛），设计了一场3D立体打姬。
运镜、动作编排这些就不细说了，好不好观众评判，这次从耳朵出发——音效和音乐。
首先音效，这场戏是多人混战，同时武器驳杂调度也大，特别适合作为例子来聊。在那个追着我要头发的音效师那里是第一步……

我们需要把细节、比例、大小、方向全部处理好，好的音效就是让你注意不到，同画面永远是一体的，是最真实的表达。但是当离开录音棚，离开拥有高解析和声场的监听级设备，很多东西就会被捏在一起，不是每个人都有好几千的耳机或音响设备去体验的，所以就来到了最后一步，就是我需要带上一个平价的耳机同时使用电脑自带的音响，再处理一遍音效。主要处理声音的重点，尽量保留细节同时把距离感和力度突出来，这种处理方式会有损音效本身的精度，但会让大部分设备都能更直接感受到我们所想表达的内容。放假走的匆匆，没拍照，有机会给大家看看剪辑软件上音轨的调整画面~
音乐也是同理，甚至更甚，毛大师那边就会用好几种喇叭模拟各种设备的效果，当然架不住坏的啊。记得刚播出那天，模型有个小姑娘看完输出的mov，跑过来慌慌张张告诉我
“李导李导，OP的声音有问题呀，念白听不清楚啊。”
我都惊了，急匆匆赶去拿起她的耳机，她告诉我
“导儿，用左耳，右耳是坏的”
我好像意识到什么，但还是拿起左耳带上，传出的声音就跟把你裹着被子沉海里一样，左边的解析一样有问题。所以啊，咱们有条件我强烈推荐戴耳机观看，稍稍在意一下自己的体感，求求了~
接着音乐部分，这一集可真是把我纠结死了，为姬如雪单独写了首《巾帼》，如果看到片尾的小伙伴可能会发现，片尾的曲子与姬如雪独战是一个旋律，它们都是《巾帼》。最终通过版其实是片尾这一首，从姬如雪拄剑站起，拔出匕首，大家可以试试把这个音乐贴上去，递进感更强更燃更合适，但问题是！音乐中的两次高潮，旋律是一样的，从姬如雪撞断柱子“而是，让他带我走！”这里开始，本想所有动效都摘掉，全靠音乐炸起来，结果，结果就是没炸起来……

当时我意识到，这种问题给毛大师淦碎了也没用，周期不等人，所有环节继续，到最终定剪时，我一咬牙，决定取上一版Demo的前半段保留最终版的后半段，在旋律上做些区别，音效也配合垫上一些，尽可能加大前后落差以增强冲击力。我都做好前面直接用Demo的准备了，毛大师知道后，赶在交片前重新录制调整，才有了两首不一样的《巾帼》，感谢毛亮老师，你简直是我们的HERO！
这些问题都是不到最后感觉不到的，突发状况，最后将进击版《巾帼》放在片尾我觉得还挺酷的，本来这集是要放原点的嘿嘿，再等等，下一集更合适！

                    <span>英特尔为 Linux 开发“软件定义芯片”功能

去年 9 月以来，英特尔一直在正在开发一个允许激活特定 CPU 功能的 Linux 内核驱动，这让人想起十年前的英特尔升级服务，它可以通过软件在某些酷睿 CPU 上激活特定功能。这个 功能 允许通过驱动程序和加密许可证，在特定的 CPU 上单独购买并激活特定的功能。但是英特尔并没有披露他们计划使用该驱动在未来的 CPU 上提供什么样的功能。


老王点评：可能有些人不知道，你购买的芯片中的某些电路其实没有工作的，而通过这个功能，以后就可以有选择性地付钱激活使用了。




黑莓以 6 亿美元出售其移动和信息专利

黑莓将这些围绕黑莓手机、QWERTY 键盘和黑莓信使（BBM）的 专利出售 给一家名为 Catapult 的新公司。在 2018 年黑莓曾将这些专利作为武器来对付 Facebook Messenger。有意思的是，这 6 亿美元的交易提供的资金中有 1.5 亿美元是期票。也就是说这家新公司，有大量的债务，没有产品，也没有现金流。这大概意味着起诉所有它认为侵犯了其新收购的专利资产的公司。


老王点评：没料到黑莓最后所剩不多的遗产居然是专利索赔。




OpenSSF 启动 Alpha-Omega 项目

该项目 已经获得了 500 万美元的启动资金，并得到了包括微软、谷歌等的支持。Alpha-Omega 将系统地寻找开源代码中尚未发现的新漏洞，然后与项目维护者合作，使其得到修复，来提升全球开源软件供应链的安全性。该项目中的 “Alpha” 代表将帮助最关键的开源项目（包括独立项目和核心生态系统服务）的维护者识别和修复安全漏洞。而 “Omega” 则确定至少 10,000 个广泛部署的开源软件项目，将自动安全分析、评分和补救指导等应用于其维护者社区。


老王点评：看起来近来几次开源供应链的事故让业界行动起来了，希望能见到实际的效果。</span>

                    <span>它不是每个人的理想选择，但作为一个 Linux 爱好者，我喜欢用它做实验。




当 Pine64 在 2019 年发布 PinePhone 时，没有人能够预见它将对移动 Linux、桌面 Linux 和隐私产生巨大的影响。

作为 少数专为运行桌面 Linux 而设计的手机 之一，它具有低端安卓手机的所有功能，同时又具有笔记本电脑的多功能性。不幸的是，桌面 Linux 就是这样：它是为台式机设计的，而不是为手机设计的。

幸运的是，由于 GNOME、KDE、Pine64 和众多 Linux 社区的惊人力量，全新的桌面环境、应用程序和发行版应运而生。其中一些比较知名的包括 Plasma Mobile、Phosh、Megapixels 和Mobian。

有了这些所有关键的部分，Pine64 需要做的就是销售 PinePhone，他们确实也卖出了 PinePhone。每一轮社区版（每个都预装了不同的发行版）的预购都收到了数千份订单，其中之一就是我的。

自从我在 2020 年 12 月收到我的设备后，PinePhone 一直是我日常生活中的重要组成部分，我在 2021 年全年都把它作为我的日常设备。以下是我使用它的经验。

它的性能就像糖浆一样

PinePhone 采用了全志 a64 系统芯片，它的功率只够完成最基本的手机任务。即使是简单的事情，如打开火狐浏览器，也需要将近 20 秒的时间，这无疑要“归功于”它仅有的 4 个核心。这与现代中高端安卓手机形成鲜明对比，所有这些手机都有至少 2GHz 的 8 核处理器。

幸运的是，社区再次介入，对数以千计的小型软件实施了优化。虽然性能仍然不如安卓系统的竞争对手，但这确实意味着 PinePhone 对于大多数手机任务来说是非常适用了，甚至在通过附带的底座使用外部显示器时，也可以使用一些面向桌面的应用程序。

👉关于作者
众所周知，人生是一个漫长的流程，不断克服困难，不断反思前进的过程。在这个过程中会产生很多对于人生的质疑和思考，于是我决定将自己的思考，经验和故事全部分享出来，以此寻找共鸣！！！
专注于Android/Unity和各种游戏开发技巧，以及各种资源分享（网站、工具、素材、源码、游戏等）
欢迎关注公众号【空名先生】获取更多资源和交流！
👉前提
这是小空坚持写的Android新手向系列，欢迎品尝。
大佬（×）
新手（√）
👉实践过程
前面小空带同学们学了EditText控件，又用其实践做了个验证码功能，以为这就完了吗？
然而并没有。

Android在5.0以后引入了Materia Design库的设计，现在又有了Jetpack UI库的设计。帮助开发者更高效的实现炫酷的UI界面，降低开发门槛。
Jetpack我们后面再说，承接之前的EditText，先说说Materia Design里的TextInputLayout。
使用方式是将TextInputEditText或EditText套到TextInputLayout内，这样友情提示信息hit就可以带有动画（上浮为标题），计数/密码可见等属性设置。
 
布局代码


    




    



这样就简单的实现了一个效果。我们在继续深入添加些属性：


    




    


从运行结果可以看出，设置了字数限制后，自动在编辑框右下角显示最大字数和当前输入字数（随着输入情况实时变化），并且更改了颜色样式
😜属性介绍
app:boxCollapsedPaddingTop 设置用于编辑文本在框模式下折叠的顶部填充的值
app:boxStrokeErrorColor 在显示错误时设置轮廓框的描边颜色。
app:boxStrokeWidth 设置描边的宽度
app:boxStrokeWidthFocused 设置获取焦点框的描边宽度
app:counterEnabled     是否显示计数器
app:counterMaxLength 设置计数器的最大值,与counterEnabled同时使用
app:counterTextAppearance       计数器的字体样式
app:counterOverflowTextAppearance 输入字符大于我们限定个数字符时的字体样式
app:errorEnabled  是否显示错误信息
app:errorTextAppearance    错误信息的字体样式
app:endIconCheckable 设置是否显示结束图标
app:endIconContentDescription 为结束图标设置内容说明
app:endIconDrawable 设置结束图标图像
app:endIconMode 设置模式
app:endIconTintMode 指定混合模式，用于将 指定的色调应用于可绘制的结束图标。
app:helperText 设置帮助文本
app:helperTextEnabled 设置是否激活帮助文本
app:helperTextTextColor 设置帮助文本颜色
app:hintAnimationEnabled  是否显示hint的动画,默认true
app:hintEnabled    是否使用hint属性,默认true
app:hintTextAppearance      设置hint的文字样式(指运行动画效果之后的样式)
app:passwordToggleDrawable    设置密码开关Drawable图片,于passwordToggleEnabled同时使用
app:passwordToggleEnabled      是否显示密码开关图片,需要EditText设置inputType
app:passwordToggleTint     设置密码开关图片颜色
app:passwordToggleTintMode    设置密码开关图片(混合颜色模式),与passwordToggleTint同时使用

Modules in Lambda
The Node14 Lambda runtime recently got support to ES6
modules and top-level await. Using them, the handler can support more modern structures.
Previously, the handler had to use CommonJS:

// commonjs

// import is via require
const dep &#x3D; require(&quot;./dep.js&quot;);

// export is with module.exports
module.exports.handler &#x3D; async (event) &#x3D;&gt; {
	return &quot;success&quot;;
};


Now it can use ESM:

// esm

// import
import dep from &quot;./dep.js&quot;;

// export
export const handler &#x3D; async (event) &#x3D;&gt; {
	return &quot;success&quot;;
};


This is great news, as the whole JS ecosystem is moving towards native modules and away from CommonJS. For example, node-fetch v3 is
ESM-only and updating to that broke Lambda handlers. In
the future, it is expected that more packages will foll…</span>

How to avoid layout shifts caused by web fonts
           
Fonts cause layout shifts when the size of the containing element (e.g. a

This occurs when the height of the font or the length of the paragraph is different with the web font compared to the system font.

                    <span>Hello! I wrote a comic last week called “life of a DNS query” that explains how
DNS resolvers work.
In this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way –
with a short Go program that does the same thing described in the comic.
The main function (resolve) is actually just 20 lines, including comments.
I usually find it easier to understand things work when they come in the form
of programs that I can run and modify and poke at, so hopefully this program
will be helpful to some of you.
The program is here: https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver/blob/main/resolve.go
what’s a DNS resolver?
When your browser needs to make a DNS query, it asks a DNS resolvers. When
they start, DNS resolvers don’t know any DNS records (except the IP addresses
of the root nameservers). But the…</span>

                    <span>B 站发布新项目让老动漫变高清

B 站在 GitHub 发布了 Real-CUGAN 项目，可让老旧动漫画面变高清。据了解，Real-CUGAN 是一个使用百万级动漫数据进行训练的，结构与 Waifu2x 兼容的通用动漫图像超分辨率模型，支持 2x/3x/4x 倍超分辨率。从官方晒出的对比图来看，修复后的画面比原版要高清得多，即便是“上古画质”如《黑猫警长》等动漫也能实现高清修复，效果十分显著。但该项目并没有指定使用的开源许可证，仅仅只是公开了源代码。


老王点评：“开源”值得鼓励，但是看来他们在“开源”之前没想好，这或许是 B 站在开源方面没有明确的管理和政策吧。




一网站因通过谷歌字体泄露访问者的 IP 地址被德国法院罚款

该网站通过在其网页上加入谷歌字体托管的字体，在未经授权和没有合法理由的情况下将身份不明的原告的 IP 地址传递给谷歌。而这违反了欧洲的《一般数据保护条例》（GDPR）。这种热链接对谷歌字体来说是正常的；这里的问题是，访问者显然没有允许他们的 IP 地址被共享。该网站被法院 罚以 110 美元，如果继续不正当使用谷歌字体，每次罚款 25 万欧元，或最多监禁 6 个月。大约有 5 千万个网站远程使用谷歌字体。


老王点评：好吧，基于两个不用说的原因，国内的网站并不需要忧虑此事。




Redis 7.0 即将迎来“重大性能优化”

                    <span>应用中的语音识别不仅仅是一个有趣的技巧，而且是一个重要的无障碍功能。




计算机的主要功能之一是解析数据。有些数据比其他数据更容易解析，而语音输入仍然是一项进展中的工作。不过，近年来该领域已经有了许多改进，其中之一就是 DeepSpeech，这是 Mozilla 的一个项目，Mozilla 是维护 Firefox 浏览器的基金会。DeepSpeech 是一个语音到文本的命令和库，使其对需要将语音输入转化为文本的用户和希望为其应用提供语音输入的开发者都很有用。

安装 DeepSpeech

DeepSpeech 是开源的，使用 Mozilla 公共许可证（MPL）发布。你可以从其 GitHub 页面下载源码。

要安装，首先为 Python 创建一个虚拟环境：

$ python3 -m pip install deepspeech --user


DeepSpeech 依靠的是机器学习。你可以自己训练它，但最简单的是在刚开始时下载预训练的模型文件。

$ mkdir DeepSpeech
$ cd Deepspeech
$ curl -LO \
  https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/deepspeech-X.Y.Z-models.pbmm
$ curl -LO \
  https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/deepspeech-X.Y.Z-models.scorer


用户应用

通过 DeepSpeech，你可以将语音的录音转录成书面文字。你可以从在最佳条件下干净录制的语音中得到最好的结果。然而，在紧要关头，你可以尝试任何录音，你可能会得到一些你需要…</span>

概述
典型的chip是一个圆角的小盒子。它有一个文本标签，并以一种有意义且紧凑的方式显示信息。chip可以在同一区域同时显示多个交互元素。一些流行的chip用例是：
发布标签（您可以在许多 WordPress ，VuePress，知乎，掘金，公众号或 GitHub等大型平台上看到它们）。
可删除的内容列表（一系列电子邮件联系人、最喜欢的音乐类型列表等）。

在 Flutter 中，您可以使用以下构造函数来实现 Chip 小部件：
Chip({
  Key? key, 
  Widget? avatar, 
  required Widget label, 
  TextStyle? labelStyle, 
  EdgeInsetsGeometry? labelPadding, 
  Widget? deleteIcon, 
  VoidCallback? onDeleted, 
  Color? deleteIconColor, 
  bool useDeleteButtonTooltip &#x3D; true, 
  String? deleteButtonTooltipMessage, 
  BorderSide? side, 
  OutlinedBorder? shape, 
  Clip clipBehavior &#x3D; Clip.none,

                    <span>开篇
flow api 已经慢慢被谷歌列为数据流的首选，可以见到官网的数据流篇都慢慢偏向于flow api，虽然LiveData等数据流类型已经深入开发者观念中，但是flow api也正慢慢的崛起出自己的市场。本篇讲的StateFlow是flow api中的一个更偏向于应用层的api，功能也非常和LiveData相似，那么为什么要出一个和LiveData类似的东西的，因为LiveData天生就引入了生命周期相关的概念，从设计角度出发，其实是耦合了生命周期这部分，所以现在才另起炉灶，出现了StateFlow。
接口部分
public interface StateFlow : SharedFlow {
    /**
     * The current value of this state flow.
     */
    public val value: T
}

可以看到StateFlow在SharedFlow上层上添加了一个属性，就是value值，可以被认为当前是当前可观测的值，跟LiveData的value类似。StateFlow更加推崇的是单体状态，所以区别于一般的flowapi（主要是数据流状态），它的实现禁止了一个重置操作。
StateFlowImpl 中
@Suppress(&quot;UNCHECKED_CAST&quot;)
override fun resetReplayCache() {
    throw UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;MutableStateFlow.resetReplayCache is not supported&quot;)
}

还有就是一般的flow属于冷流，冷流这个概念就不再赘述，而flow之所以是冷流，是因为只有在collect的时候间接通过flowcollecter的emit方法去产生数据，本质上数据的改变…</span>

Maybe all five are different. This post will give two examples where the products above are all different: octonions and matrix multiplication. […]

                    <span>大家好，我是韩东君，在《长津湖之水门桥》中饰演第七穿插连第280名战士，神枪手平河。


我相信不仅对我，对每一个参与其中的人来说，《水门桥》都是一部承载着重要意义的电影，从长津湖到水门桥，七连的志愿军战士们踏过一座又一座战场，在一场场汹涌的战火硝烟中冲锋陷阵，为了身后的家，更是为了心中的国。


对我而言，《长津湖之水门桥》中有太多印象深刻的故事了。在完成影片拍摄后的很长一段时间里，那些故事和故事里的人，以及我们一起在拍摄现场所经历的种种，时常在我脑海里复演。相信大家看完电影以后，也会和我有同样的感受。


首先还是先说说平河吧。
我至今还记得第一次在剧本中看到平河这个角色时的第一感受，就是“好奇”。平河是个不太爱讲话的人，无论是在战场内外，你很难通过他说了什么话，来判断他是一个什么样的人。但是在《长津湖》中，他枪法奇准，擅用各种枪械武器，并且还知道圣诞节的由来。这样一来，这个人物的多面性和独特性就凸显出来。在后来的每一次拍摄中，我都会不断地琢磨，平河来自哪里，职业是什么，有什么样的家庭，有什么爱好，抗美援朝战争爆发之前，他有过哪些经历等等。在不断的“自我对话”（其实是韩东君与平河的对话）后，我逐渐找到这个角色的重心——他是一个有学识、有思想、有胆魄，同时又不喜高调的人。


我很喜欢平河的名字，这两个字倒过来念，就是“和平”。无论是在《长津湖》还是《水门桥》中，和平，都是所有人的心愿。我曾跟导演讨论过，想通过设计一些细节，让观众找到一条走进平河内心的道路。所以后来便有了：一场大战过后，平河坐在美军的坦克上，在弹壳上刻下一个“平”字。他把自己每一次的“劫后余生”都纪念在这枚弹壳上，只要上面的“平”字还在不断增加，自己就可以坚持，直到取得最终胜利，和战友们一起回家。对平河来说，弹壳是他的护身符，而在《水门桥》中，有一个大家看不到的细节——平河将弹壳从手腕解下，挂在了他使用的…</span>

                    <span>网易赚疯了吧。命运手游应该也没什么影响。

从梗的角度：Sony can finally get that Halo killer from the devs of Halo.
长期风险还挺大的，Bungie 就不是一个听话干活的团队：

2000 年，Bungie：我们宣布加入微软
2007 年，Bungie：我们宣布离开微软，因为想要独立做开发
2010 年，Bungie：我们宣布已经和动视达成了一项十年期的协议
2018 年，Bungie：因为和动视存在分歧，我们决定分开，Bungie 会是一个独立的……
2022 年，Bungie：我们很高兴宣布，Bungie 已经成为了 Sony Game Studios 的一份子

通过光环成名后就变得非常的投机主义，也相当的又当又立。
几十亿美元的 deal 不是说索尼看到微软收购动视之后赶紧 go shopping 后谈判达成的。Bungie 这帮人应该是大几个月前，收到风声之后 (Bobby Kotick 自己也说，不止和微软谈过，业内大佬很多都知道)，觉得自己奇货可居，动了高价又卖一遍的心思。

说回事件本身，当然还是作为射击品类的防御。
动视之于索尼和微软两大主机平台，就是他们相争之间的一个顶级军火商，拿着 COD 两边钱都要赚。(阿纳海姆之于联邦和吉翁……) 现在动视被收购后，几个最大游戏品类的格局是：

枪：微软大幅占优，稍微扳回来的话是收 EA 拿战地 + 重生 (后者才是大杀器其实……不过 DICE 和重生都是 Vince Zampella 一个老板了)，但索尼钱袋子不够；而堡垒之夜是不可能的，Epic 一定要打通全平台
球：2K 和 EA 还是中立，索尼也不够钱收购，而且球类很依赖 IP 有高额的授权金，不上全平台会很伤
叙事动作：索尼占优，但育碧、R 星、卡普空这些第三方也还在出来好作品，而且索尼的工作室一…</span>

                    <span>Many &quot;must-read&quot; books are not well-written. I try to read a
lot, but I
still have a low tolerance for bad writing and bad editing. I write
this post both to discourage thoughtless recommendations and to
encourage the receivers of bad recommendations.
For software developers, Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs is a prime example. Written for freshman at MIT, it is
ostensibly an entry-level text. But it requires such a level of
competence in math and physics, and the prose itself is so dense and
archaic, that I couldn&#x27;t imagine suggesting it to anyone.
And yet it is one of the most recommended books for developers.
This is not to say that SICP is a bad book or that you should not read
it. I just don&#x27;t think it should ever be suggested to anyone.

                    <span>Render Tree 的创建过程
RenderObject 的类型
我们知道 Element 主要分为负责渲染的 RenderObjectElement  和负责组合的 ComponentElement 两大类，而创建 RenderObject 节点的是前者 mount() 方法中调用的 RenderObjectWidget.createRenderObject() 方法。
该方法是一个抽象方法，需要子类实现，对于不同的布局的 Widget 创建的 RenderObject 类型也不一样，在 Render Tree 中最主要的有两种 RenderObject：
首先是在 RenderObject 注释说明中大量提到了一个类 RenderBox，它是大部分的 RenderObjectWidget 所对应的 RenderObject 的抽象类
/// A render object in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
/// 一个在 2D 坐标系中的渲染对象
abstract class RenderBox extends RenderObject

以及 Render Tree 的根节点 RenderView
/// The root of the render tree.
/// Render Tree 的根节点，处理渲染管道的引导和渲染树的输出
/// 它有一个填充整个输出表面的 RenderBox 类型的唯一子节点
class RenderView extends RenderObject with RenderObjectWithChildMixin

其他的类型的 RenderObject 基本是为了特定布局（如滑动、列表）的实现，但大部分都直接或间接集成自 RenderBox。
通常一个 RenderBox 只有一个子节点（…</span>

跨平台开发已经成为过去几年的趋势之一，毫无疑问大多数时候开发人员对跨平台社区充满热情，而 Google 凭借着其 UI 框架—— Flutter 进入了这个市场。
但是将跨平台的支持也扩展到 Web 上其实并不容易，而 Flutter 的解决方案就是 Flutter for Web
简介：是什么和为什么
Flutter 是一个 Google 的一个跨平台 UI 框架，旨在帮助开发人员创建更接近原生、高性能和更有吸引力的移动端应用，然而 Flutter 的目标是为每个设备窗口创建用户界面，而不仅仅是在移动应用上。
对于 Web 的支持，Flutter 提供了与其移动端相同的开发体验，这得益于便捷的 Dart 、Web 平台生态的强大、以及 Flutter 框架的灵活拓展， 现在开发者可以直接创建 iOS 和 Android 之外的 Web 应用。
由于对于 Web 来说，它和  iOS 和 Android 是使用同一个 Flutter 框架， Web 只是开发者项目里可支持的框架之一，所以一般情况下，你可以将用 Dart 编写的原有 Flutter 项目直接编译成 Web 体验。
在这里我们将分析 Flutter web（与 React、Angular 和 Vue 等 SPA 框架的对比）、桌面（与 Electron 和 Qt 对比）的当前状态，并希望在未来通过一些额外的努力实现兼容嵌入式设备等等。
但是..它是如何工作的？

当不满足官方的ProgressIndicator的时候，作为一名优秀的安卓开发者，肯定要自定义一个啦

自定义ProgressIndicator
compose的Canvas提供了丰富的Api足以满足我们打造各种炫酷效果，我们只管发挥想象力，之前我有写过用Compose画太阳和月亮，感兴趣的可以去我的文章里面看。
传统写法Android自定义加载进度条+自定义Dialog简洁弹窗 - 掘金 (juejin.cn)
首先用Canvas的drawLine简单画一条直线
Canvas(modifier.padding(16.dp).fillMaxWidth()) {

        val canvasWidth &#x3D; size.width  // 画布的宽
        val canvasHeight &#x3D; size.height  // 画布的高

        drawLine(
            color &#x3D; Color.Green,
            start &#x3D; Offset(0f, 0f),
            end &#x3D; Offset(canvasWidth, 0f),
            strokeWidth &#x3D; 40f         
        )
    }


用StrokeCap设置成圆角
cap &#x3D; StrokeCap.Round

这绿太刺眼换一个

接着传值让它动起来
value的范围 0~100
那么进度条的宽度就是画布的总宽度× (value/100)

                    <span>黄色的开端
前几天用Okhttp的时候写了一个请求，代码突然变黄了。通常来说会这样写，就算封装也离不开4步
withContext(Dispatchers.IO){
    val client &#x3D; OkHttpClient.Builder().build()
    val request &#x3D; Request.Builder().build()
    client.newCall(request).execute()
}

但是它突然变黄了

我本以为是IO的警告，加上try、catch还是不行，鼠标一动到黄色位置,提示警告：
Inappropriate blocking method call 
黄色的原因
不适当的阻塞方法调用
这是什么意思呢？
变成了 这个任务在一个线程上运行。不完全利用。
探索黄色
okhttp点进去看
  @Throws(IOException::class)
  fun execute(): Response

  fun enqueue(responseCallback: Callback)

原来抛出了IOException。
猜想，try、catch不能清除黄色，那么肯定更异常没关系。写了一个方法，修改抛出的异常
@Throws(NullPointerException::class)
fun execute() {
}

结果只有IOException会这样。
就4行代码，肯定和协程有关。
既然是协程，又是IO问题，看了一眼IOException类，又点了一下，看看继承IOException，被60多个类继承了。

看到了SocketException，突然想到，Socket也是一个IO操作，假设Socket连上了，然后阻塞在了这里，如果Socket突然断开了，通常会try、catch，关闭Socket。
withContext(Dispatchers.IO){
    //...
    IO操作
    //...
}

在协程里有个请求，协程不知道它IO操作要多久，假设IO他一直在执行，那协程可能就单独放到一个线程执行，一直阻塞。这不能发挥 协程的 真正作用。所以编译器提示了警告：这个阻塞不太适当
解决黄色
原因：协程认为可能抛出IO异常的代码，可能会一直阻塞，把代码放到线程执行。
协程就是处理耗时任务，只是不想浪费资源。所以 我们期望都在协程上执行。
解决：把代码 丢到一个可取消的协程上执行
val response &#x3D; suspendCancellableCoroutine {
    client.newCall(request).execute()
}

表示这段代码可以被取消。成功则返回Response，失败则取消这个协程。关于异步同样可以使用call.cancel()
关于
关于我的Httplib，对Okhttp进行了简单的封装。OnceHttp
使用：
ktHttpConfig(this) {
    host &#x3D; &quot;https://www.wanandroid.com/&quot;
    //公共的 header参数
    header[&quot;appVersion&quot;] &#x3D; &quot;1.0.0&quot;
    //公共的 body参数
    //mapData[&quot;appVersion&quot;] &#x3D; &quot;1.0.0&quot;
    //可以传入一个client
    //okHttpClient &#x3D; OkHttpClient.Builder().build()
}

请求继承 OnceRequest() 就好，api、header、body可以自由更改
OnceRequest，增加了两个拦截的方法
//请求之前 修改 请求的数据
open fun beforeRequest(map:MutableMap) &#x3D; mapData
//请求之后 修改 返回的数据
open fun  afterRequest(bean:T) : T &#x3D; bean

在一次请求前，修改参数，在请求后，修改返回的数据。（比如：请求其他服务器，加密解密方式不同）
也提供了3种数据返回方式
requestBackLiveData(): LiveData 
requestBackFlow(): Flow
requestBackBean():T

                    <span>虎年春节就要到了，在这里提前祝大家新年快乐，身体健康，万事顺利！
和往年一样，各大游戏平台也适时举行了各种春节促销活动；为了给你的红包找一个好去处，我们在 Steam、Epic、PlayStation、Switch 平台上挑挑拣拣，选出了一些折扣诱人，值得购买的游戏。以下就是这些史低或是好价游戏的汇总，希望大家都能度过一个愉快的春节！
Steam：史低佳作不少
Steam 今年的农历新年特卖将于 2 月 3 日上午 10 时截止，结束得比其他平台都稍微早一些。
节日特卖必然会出现的免费贴纸，这次也没有缺席；特卖期间，每天都可以在 Steam 的「点数商店」中领取一张免费的动画贴纸；贴纸也都是很应景的「萌」虎主题，可爱程度还是挺足的。怎么说呢，不领白不领吧。

除此之外，虎年的个人资料装扮以及一张静态表情还同步上架了「点数商店」，不过这俩都是需要使用点数兑换的：

至于特卖活动本身，从折扣幅度来说，紧接着年底假日档的春节特卖注定不会特别抓人眼球；但细细一看的话，其实史低的佳作还是不少。
首先是原价 459 元的《女神异闻录5 乱战 魅影攻手》，五折后仅需 229.5 元即可收入囊中。虽然这部作品很好地将 P5 的魅力和亮点融入了类「无双」的动作玩法；但是，SEGA，为什么先不把 P5R 搬上 PC 呢？毕竟这一部的故事可是接续原作的呀……

假期要是有大把空闲时间等着消磨，那来一个种田游戏也不错？只不过，《符文工房 4 特别版》除了播种和收获环节，还有着地牢探险等战斗玩法，这也使得它的体验更为接近一款 ARPG。论要素的丰富程度，这部作品定不会让你失望，事实上，许多老粉丝对这部作品的评价甚至高过新作……

本作此次八折史低，折后 152 元，要低于 Switch 版。
对于 CRPG 爱好者而言，料足大碗，广受赞誉的《开拓者：正义之怒》，也迎来了八折史低，折后仅 150.4 …</span>

少数派深入仓库慰问留深水獭
新春佳节来临之际，为了让水獭们感受到少数派的关心爱护，1 月 30 日早上 6 时许，部分少数派员工在站长老麦的带领下，来到官方商城仓库一线，慰问滞销留深的水獭。老麦与水獭亲切交流，详细询问了它们的生活情况，对它们去年做出的贡献表示了充分的肯定，致以春节的祝福。
慰问活动现场
探访过程中，老麦亲切询问了一些水獭不能回家过年的原因。一名原籍在水族馆的水獭表示，听老家邻居企鹅说当地今年春节只允许居民玩 14 个小时的游戏，因此宁愿不回去。一名员工听后立刻捐出了自己的进口游戏机，请它尽情畅玩，但注意保护视力。
在视频通话慰问一名正居家观察的水獭时，其称月初某天正外出吃派，突然好奇「π」之前的字母是什么，便搜索了希腊字母表，找到答案后大声反复朗诵，结果发现行程码突然变黄，随即被附近热心群众带走隔离。少数派员工当即为它发放了专属红包封面，并勉励它说，「红包都来了，绿码还会远吗？」
此次慰问，充分体现了少数派对水獭工作的重视及对一线水獭的关怀。水獭们纷纷表示，绝不辜负老麦、少数派、少数派读者的殷切期望，在虎年工作中更加恪尽职守、认真履责，交上一份「一獭虎途」的答卷。
传少数派拟开展餐饮业务
近日，网上有传闻称少数派可能在策划进军餐饮行业。据了解，该传闻的起源是社交网络上一张来源不明的截图，其中称少数派重金采购了屠龙刀，可能是用来切菜。此外，根据对少数派办公室附近快递包装的成分检测，发现大部分跟小红薯是一致的，怀疑是该团队正在测试食材。截图还称，少数派的新业务是为了满足「真实、迫切的需求」，最近已经「吃堡撑了」等，这显然是指供应食物。

                    <span>今天除夕，然而今年除夕不是“大年三十”，是“大年廿九”。
理解这个事情，有几个层次。
第一层：还有多少“大年廿九”？
我考察了前后各一个世纪（1920s-2110s）的数据，发现两百年间，有118个“大年三十”、83个“大年廿九”。列表如下：
“大”表示30天的大月，“小”表示29天的小月
第二层：为什么会有三十/廿九（大小月）的差别？
因为月相变化周期（朔望月）的平均长度是29.530588天，不是整数。农历为了确保每个“朔”（新月）都在初一，必须根据实际月相调整每个月的长度，使之取29天或30天。
当然，你可能意识到了，“平均长度”意味着每个朔望月的长度是可以有变化的。实际上变化范围可以相当大：从不足29.3天到29.8天多，可以浮动半天还多。

第三层：那么大小月是由朔望周期决定的吗？
不难理解，不只由朔望周期决定。
假设这个月的新月开始于某天0时，假设这个月的朔望周期是29.5天，那么下一个新月出现在第30天中午12点——也就是说第30天会被定义为下个月初一，本月就只能享有29天，成为小月。
但如果这个月的新月开始于某天12时之后，下一个新月出现在第31天午夜0时之后，那么第31天才会被定义为下个月初一，本月可以成为拥有30天的“大月”。
所以，大小月由两个参数决定：本月月初的新月出现在几点，以及本月的朔望周期。如下图所示。
图中橙色、蓝色点的分界线，就是次月新月刚好卡在第30天、第31天之间的午夜0时的情况。

第四层：为什么“大年三十”比“大年廿九”多？
按照朔望周期平均29.53天考虑，大月、小月的数量之比应该是53:47～1.13。
我统计了1921到2121这两个世纪，其中大月有1319个，小月有1167个，1319:1167&#x3D;1.130，完全符合预期。
但是，同期的大年三十和大年廿九的比例，却是118:83&#x3D;1.42，比预期的1.13显著更大，这是为什么呢？
我画出朔望周期在每年各个月份的分布：

可以看出，年底年初的朔望周期，平均来说比年中的朔望周期要长4个小时——这是因为，地球在1月份到达近日点，绕日公转最快，此时月球需要追更长时间才能到达同样的相位，因此朔望周期较长。
因此农历十二月，也就有更大的机会分到大月。

总结：
朔望月的平均长度是29.530588天，但是可以在约29.3到29.8之间浮动。
农历大小月取决于当月和下月的新月出现在哪天。或者说，取决于当月月初的新月时刻和该月朔望周期。
虽然大小月的总体比例接近53:47，但是腊月的大小月比例显著较高，可达1.42，因此大年多“三十”，较少“廿九”。
你明白了吗？

Green indicates that a letter is in the correct location. Yellow indicates that the secret word contains the letter, but it is in the wrong location.

数据的转换
对于 Compose 中的数据，用 mutableStateOf() 包裹来实现监听刷新我们已经轻车熟路。那如果一个数据依赖于另一个或多个数据怎么办？这就用到 derivedStateOf()，它专门用于数据的转换，当上游数据发生变化时会自动刷新下游数据，进一步刷新 UI。有点类似 LiveData 中 Transformations.switchMap 的作用。
Show me the code:
setContent {
    var name by remember { mutableStateOf(&quot;chenhe&quot;) }
    val upperName by remember { derivedStateOf { name.uppercase() } }
    Column {
        Text(upperName)
        Button(onClick &#x3D; { name &#x3D; &quot;bob&quot; }) {
            Text(text &#x3D; &quot;Change Name&quot;)
        }
    }
}

upperName 由 name 转换得来，一开始会显示 &quot;CHENHE&quot;，点击按钮后变成 &quot;BOB&quot;。好了，本节到此结束 😋
当然没那么简单 - -
为什么一定要经过包装才行呢？换句话说，套一层 derivedStateOf() 是为了解决什么问题？答案是：
上游数据改变时要重新处理。
上游数据没有改变时，不要重新处理。
诶？变则刷新，不变就不刷新... 听起来很像 remember 的用法？！那就试试看：
var name by remember { mutableStateOf(&quot;chenhe&quot;) }
val upperName &#x3D; …</span>

                    <span>2021 年，Flutter 正式进入 2.x 系列的正式版发布，年初的 Flutter 2 的发布 打开了一个新的“格局”，为 Flutter 的加入了第五大特色——「可移植性」，让 Flutter 从一个移动框架正式“升级”为一个「可移植框架」，目标是让 Flutter 应用基本可以不加变动地在多种平台上运行。通过 Flutter，开发者们可以为任何平台创建美观、快速且可移植的应用。3 月份，除了 Web 平台发布稳定版 之外，Flutter 也开始向桌面、可折叠和嵌入式设备上进行扩展。随之发布的 Dart 2.12 正式版 提供了健全的空安全和 FFI 的生产环境级支持。Dart 是一个站在 Flutter 背后的“秘密武器”，我们提到的很多 Flutter 的“闪光点”，实际很大程度要归功于 Dart: 包括我们熟知的有状态的热重载 (Stateful Hot-Reload)，以及 Dart FFI 的成熟支撑了 Flutter 2 提到的「可移植性」，以及最新 Flutter 2.8 稳定版中关于性能的提升的部分，都离不开 Dart。
21 年 5 月下旬的 I/O 大会仍是在线上举办，Flutter 2.2 和 Dart 2.13 稳定版正式发布。除了不断进化的 Web 支持，Flutter 也在移动平台有了很多关于性能方面的改进，也着手从基础侧为 Flutter 增强扩展到其他平台进行改进。Flutter 2.2 着重改进开发体验，新项目会默认自动启用健全的空安全，Flutter 的开发者工具 (DevTools) 并和 IDE 插件都得以改进和更新，DartPad 也为教学者增加了引导式代码体验。Dart 2.13 对空安全加入了更多更新，并推出了开发者们非常期待的「类型别名」的新特性。

@Kostya：焖饭 / 可乐鸡翅
焖饭
过年想给给主食添点不一样的料？焖饭确实可以帮到你。考虑到制作的容易程度、极高的安全系数（指：很难做得不好吃，最差你就是收获了一锅米饭）以及自定义程度，用焖饭来「露一手」可谓是绝不会「失手」。
焖饭本身可以使用的食材种类很多，不过今天介绍的主要是使用豆角、香菇、木耳和猪肉片做的焖饭。首先，痩猪肉洗净、切片并加适量的酱油、盐、糖、胡椒粉和料酒腌制 10-15 分钟。取 3-5 只木耳、香菇泡发，泡发后洗净并切成小块、分开放置。豆角洗净后切成 3-5 cm 的小段即可。
在焖饭前，我们要先将以上食材下炒锅做成半成品。锅中放少许油，稍加热后放入香菇炒香，然后加入切好的葱花大火翻炒一会儿。等香气扑鼻，加入之前腌制好的肉片，大火翻炒一会儿，肉稍变色即可加入豆角。加入豆角之后，滴入少量的酱油、盐、糖，转小火翻炒一会儿，使得豆角变色、有少许水分渗出即可。
接下来，根据需要的米饭量在电饭锅中加适量的米和水，水的位置比平常可以稍低一些（因为我们上一步做出来的半成品菜里也会有些水）。米、水放完后，直接加入我们刚刚做完的半成品，同时铺上之前切好的木耳。使用正常的电饭锅程序煮饭，完成后即可得到香喷喷的焖饭啦～此时豆角软烂、猪肉也已经煮透，口感尚佳。

Tips：

如果想要焖饭更有味道，可以在制作半成品时加入更多的盐和酱油。
也可以使用其他类型的食材制作焖饭，比如鸡翅、土豆、番茄等，但白菜等不太适合制作焖饭。

可乐鸡翅
这道菜曾经被誉为「留学生最拿手的菜」，可见其在烹饪方式及用料上的容易程度。可乐不仅仅为鸡翅添色不少，…</span>

@甜約翰：废柴青年龙南待业在家，不得不每天看家人的脸色生活，而他擅长的只有攀岩。在母亲 70 岁的寿宴上，龙南遇到了曾经告白失败的大学后辈仪珠，然而此时，整个城市正被来源不明的有毒气体侵入，危机时刻，两人果断携起手来帮助大家逃生……

                    <span>I’ve been having a hard time understanding IPv6. On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty
straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the
internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for
everyone!)
But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One
question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing
them THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?
I asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6
and I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here. These all come
with the disclaimer that I have basically 0 experience with IPv6 so I can’t evaluate these reasons very well.
First though, I want to explain why it’s possible for twitter.com to no…</span>

                    <span>1.前言
谷歌推出flow api已经很久了，俗称为数据流。
我们老规矩看下定义，数据流以协程为基础构建，可提供多个值。从概念上来讲，数据流是可通过异步方式进行计算处理的一组数据序列。例如，Flow 是发出整数值的数据流。
数据流与生成一组序列值的 Iterator 非常相似，但它使用挂起函数通过异步方式生成和使用值。这就是说，例如，数据流可安全地发出网络请求以生成下一个值，而不会阻塞主线程。这么一大堆，其实就是说，flow就像一个流一样，可以在其中生成数值，并且可在协程中使用，哎呦，官方是真的疼爱Coroutine。
基于flow api这种特性，我们可以在很多数据通讯场景中得到使用，同时由于flow 在协程场景下运用，可以用来封装很多有趣的东西，本文就带来了一个利用该api封装的总线型库。
2. 预演
前面讲了一大堆概念，那么我们该看一下具体代码表现了，首先是Flow
public interface Flow {
    @InternalCoroutinesApi
    public suspend fun collect(collector: FlowCollector)
}

其实就是一个接口，里面提供了一个collect方法，作用很简单，就是收集数据，还有就是注意它是一个suspend方法，目的就是想要规范在协程内使用，本篇不去深究协程和suspend的种种关系，因为不是这次的重点。也就是说collect运行在某个协程内部，ok搞定。注意看参数FlowCollector，那么这是个什么东西呢？
别急，在下面
public interface FlowCollector {
    public suspend fun emit(value: T)
}

FlowCollector接口里面定义了flow api的发送规范，注意其也是一个suspend方法，它就…</span>

                    <span>前言
看到有人说 MVVM 核心是 双向绑定，没有使用 Databinding 的项目都是假 MVVM 。
今天我们便来聊一聊 Android 中的 MVVM。
MVVM
MVVM（Model-View-ViewModel）最早由微软提出。ViewModel指 &quot;Model of View&quot;——视图的模型。

Model：它仅仅关注数据本身，不关心任何行为。
View：负责接收用户输入、发起数据请求及展示结果页面。
ViewModel：负责业务逻辑，实现 View 与 Model 的双向绑定。
双向绑定
简而言之，视图随数据改变，数据随视图改变。

Android 中的 MVVM
在 Android 中我们通过 Jetpack 提供的多个组件来实现 MVVM 。

Model：对应图中的 Repository（网络请求数据、本地数据库数据等）。
View：对应图中的 Activity/Fragment 。
ViewModel：对应图中的 ViewModel 和 LiveData。
ViewModel + LiveData 实现双向绑定
Activity/Fragment 通过观察 ViewModel 中的 LiveData 来更新界面。
Repository 通过更新 ViewModel 中的 LiveData 来更新界面。
单纯的文字可能比较晦涩难懂，我们结合代码来看会更加清晰。

一、WorkManager
WorkManager 是持久工作的推荐解决方案。当通过应用程序重启和系统重启保持计划时，工作是持久的。由于大多数后台处理最好通过持久性工作来完成，WorkManager 是后台处理的主要推荐API。
使用 WorkManager 注册的周期性任务不一定会准时执行，这不是Bug，而是系统为了减少电量消耗可能会将触发事件接近的几个任务放在一起执行，这样可以大幅度减少CPU唤起次数，从而有效延长电池时间。
注意：WorkManager 和 Seriver 不是一个概念，也没有直接联系。Seriver 是Android系统的四大组件之一。WorkManager 只是一个处理定时任务的工具。
1.1 WorkManager的类型
WorkManager处理三种类型的持久性工作：
Immediate(立即)：必须立即开始并很快完成的任务。可能会加快。
Long Running(长时间)：任务可能会运行更长时间，可能会超过10分钟。
Deferrable(可延期)：计划的任务，在以后开始，可以定期运行。
下图概述了不同类型的持久性工作是如何相互关联的：

                    <span>一个界面中用近似色系中不同的颜色区分不同的功能是界面设计里常用的设计方法，但又有谁想到不同的颜色也会给部分人带来压力呢？前段时间 iMessage 服务在美国因为「蓝色聊天气泡」和「绿色聊天气泡」的设计引发了不小的讨论。

但因为国内的 iMessage 用户不多，所以讨论的人也不多，甚至有不少朋友都不知道这件事。所以我也打算从这个讨论开始和大家一起聊聊 iMessage、RCS 消息以及 5G 消息的特点和不同。
iMessage 的「绿气泡」和「蓝气泡」
最近这轮关于 iMessage 争议的开端，是《华尔街日报》2022 年 1 月 8 日刊登的报道《Apple 的蓝泡泡帝国》（Apple’s Blue Bubble Empire1），这篇报道大致阐述了这样一个观点：「Apple 通过颜色区分普通短信（SMS）消息和 iMessage 消息，目的是使用 Android 手机的美国青少年在社交上倍感压力，让更多的人继续使用 iPhone」。
其实，iMessage 的封闭生态，以及其消息气泡颜色对用户社交关系的潜在影响，在过去已经被讨论过很多次。美国网络语汇中很早就有「green bubble struggle」的说法；三星还曾在 2019 年专门 汇集一组 GIF 动图 揶揄 iMessage 的气泡颜色。但《华尔街日报》以主流大报的身份参与这个话题，确实引发了更为广泛和激烈的讨论。
文章发出后，Google 高级副总裁、Android 团队负责人 Hiroshi Lockheimer 在推特上转发了这篇文章并 评论 道：

Apple 用 iMessage 套牢用户是铁证如山的计谋。作为一家将人性和公平作为核心营销点的公司，利用同辈压力（peer pressure，指因害怕被同伴排挤而放弃自我做出顺应别人的选择——编注）和欺凌销售产品是虚伪的。现有的标准完全可以解决…</span>

                    <span>在今年的新年节日主题中，Apple 为我们带来了一个全新的活动：用 Keynote 制作一张贺卡送给亲友。在 Apple 提供的新年贺卡模板里，大胆地运用了多种色彩和元素，颇有「波普风格」的味道，十分具有艺术感。

不过转念一想，我还是为 Apple 捏了把汗：这些设计用来送给年轻的「亚逼」1朋友或许非常适合，但如果要送给家中长辈或年纪较小的孩子，就显得有些过于浮夸了。考虑到农历新年的主要氛围还是热烈的红色，所以我们不妨通过自己动手，在 Keynote 上来制作一张属于自己的贺卡。
或许你会觉得，「设计」本身就是一个比较复杂的东西，面对着一张空白的画板，不知道要做点什么。不用担心，这一次其实不需要太多美术功底，只要你有一个相对好一些的审美，就能够在网上找到合适的素材，一点一点将它拼出你心目中的样子。
对了，如果你觉得新年与「红色」的相关性是刻板印象，你也可以选择一个你喜欢的颜色。
尺寸设定
如今，纸质的贺卡已经逐渐被排版优美和展现形式多样的电子贺卡所取代，所以很可能我们不会将设计好的贺卡打印出来，而是通过社交媒体来传播。考虑到如今最贴近人身边的屏幕依然还是手机，因此建议还是将贺卡的版面调整为手机竖版。
与此同时，当今大部分手机都已经是全面屏，因此最好不要用 9:16 的画面比例，而是采用 18:9 这样的比例来制作，尽量利用好屏幕的显示空间，营造更浓烈的氛围感。此外还要注意，不少全面屏的四角和顶部空间都是不可用的，在制作时记得不要在这些地方摆放重要元素，避免被遮挡，这些区域在设计上被称为「安全区外的空间」。
记得把内容放在安全区域内
当然啦，横版的贺卡也不是不行，不过如果是横版的话，建议可以添加一些精美的动画效果，然后导出成视频，增加互动的同时，也能带来更多乐趣。
如果你有心，还可以制作两个版本。两个版本在本质上不会太难，只需要将一些元素重新排布即可。
风格和元素

Hey there! 👋
This week has been a bit of a whirlwind for me — moving a lot of things forward all at once. 🌪
Some quick things… 
I set myself up on Strava and have decided to use it with fitness activity. If you are on Strava feel free to connect with me. I don’t mind using social dynamics when I know the outcome of them is good for me. 💪
A while back I created a listing for the Weekly Thing on Readsom. I love when new people find this project, and if you are a fan of the Weekly Thing I would greatly appreciate leaving a review on Readsom to help more people discover it. 👌
And while I’m in a marketing mood 💀 the Winter issue…</span>

                    <span>如果你看到了这篇文章，那么恭喜你，你将成为全中国最先了解“维C黄脸”真相的一批人。
关于用了维C为什么脸黄，目前中文互联网上的解释都很牵强。于是我去查了一下文献，发现事实远比想象的复杂。除了脸变黄外，手掌，指甲缝还有手指缝都有可能变黄，这种变黄没法用清洁产品洗掉，只能等皮肤慢慢代谢掉。停用之后，基本上一两个星期，皮肤变黄就会消失，而且你会发现肤色比用之前更提亮了一个色号。
目前中文互联网对于维C变黄的解释很牵强
关于为什么维C上脸之后，有些人会变黄，目前中文互联网的主流说法是维C的氧化。因为一些维C精华放久了之后，会呈现出比较深的颜色。于是自然而然的认为维C上脸之后被氧化，也是染黄皮肤的元凶。但是这过程中，大家常常忽略一个点，那就是维C精华的颜色并没有深到可以染黄皮肤的地步。
我手头正好有一瓶接近保质期的维C精华，大家可以看到颜色非常深。

把精华滴一点到手上，颜色对比非常明显，然而涂开之后，对皮肤的颜色根本没有影响。

这是因为维C氧化之后，颜色虽然会变深，但是真正有颜色的成分非常少。这些成分又都是水溶性的，根本没法染黄我们的皮肤。
用了维C脸黄的元凶竟然是它
为了搞清楚用了维C脸黄的原因，我查找了大量文献，终于找到了合理的解释。维C染黄角质层的元凶其实是维C代谢的产物之一：赤藓酮糖。
看到赤藓酮糖这四个字，你的第一反应一定是：这是什么鬼？

实际上，赤藓酮糖在国外可是个大大有名的成分，它是欧美常用的美黑剂。
和亚洲人不同，欧美人喜欢颜色深的皮肤，这样的人被认为是有钱去海边度假，所以看起来给人感觉比较健康比较美。然而不是所有人都有钱有时间去海边度假，于是国外专门有一类美黑护肤品，而这个赤藓酮糖就是美黑剂的主要成分。它能和角化细胞中的角蛋白结合，形成类黑素，从而让皮肤颜色看起来更深。

由赤藓酮糖来的类黑素并不是黑色的，而是红棕色，当用量较少的时候，看起来就是黄不拉几的颜色。实际上，赤藓酮糖的短期使用效果和维C染黄脸的效果一毛一样！

从维C到赤藓酮糖，鬼知道我经历了什么
维C的氧化是个非常复杂的过程[1]。简单来说，维C（抗坏血酸）先会变成脱氢抗坏血酸。随后脱氢抗坏血酸进一步变成2,3-二酮古洛糖酸。以此为基础，接下来是非常复杂的化学反应，生成的产物也非常多。而赤藓酮糖就是其中的产物之一。

根据实验，一份维C如果氧化降解完全，可以生成至多0.28份赤藓酮糖，这个转化率相当高了。一般欧美使用赤藓酮糖作为美黑剂，这个成分的添加量是5%。所以如果维C精华含有15%的维C，如果全部氧化完全，相当于4.2%的赤藓酮糖，和欧美主流的美黑剂差不多了。
好在现在主流的维C精华都使用各种方式来稳定维C，维C降解不多。上脸之后，如果做好防晒，停留在角质层中的维C被氧化的概率也不太大。产生的赤藓酮糖也就非常少了。
脸黄了怎么办？
很多人用维C明明是为了提亮肤色，结果脸变黄了，郁闷的同时还不免担心起来，染黄的脸洗都洗不掉！
其实用了维C之后脸变黄大可不必焦虑，直接停用维C就是了。停止使用之后，也就缺少了赤藓酮糖的输入，皮肤中也就不会形成类黑素，皮肤就不会继续变黄。
而根据赤藓酮糖的工作原理，它一般只作用于角质层最外层的一些角化细胞。而且我们的皮肤也会正常代谢。随着皮肤的代谢，这些染黄的角化细胞基本上一周就会代谢干净，最长不会超过两周。
如果你又喜欢维C的功效，又不想皮肤变黄，那么还有个办法就是搭配使用一些果酸类的产品。日常使用维C的时候，手指手掌处的染黄会更明显，因为这些地方的角质层更厚，有更多的角蛋白和赤藓酮糖反应。使用一些温和的果酸类产品剥脱角质层，让角质层薄一些，脸黄就不那么明显了。当然，在使用果酸之前，得确保自己皮肤耐受，而且不是敏感肌。


小结一下，用维C脸变黄并不是因为简单的氧化。而是因为维C转化成了赤藓酮糖，而这个成分能和角化细胞结合，形成类黑色素，从而染黄角质层。解决的问题很简单，要么停用维C，脸黄一两周就会消失；要么使用温和的果酸轻微剥脱角质层，减少黄气。

                    <span>先上图，证明不是吹牛皮，不是纸上谈兵。

这个是半路截的图，中间还有三百多公里是导航到目的地以后又导航到其他的地方的。
那天一大早是准备开车从日照先去烟台轮渡码头上船去大连的，然后开了三百多公里到了烟台码头才被告知整个渤海湾封海了，问多久开，告知三天后。
开玩笑呢？三天后？啥事儿都耽误了。当即决定围着渤海湾画个C到大连。然后买了一整箱蓝瓶红牛。（蓝瓶红牛提神效果比金瓶效果好。）
我跟我同事俩人，他驾驶证刚出实习期，一路上尽量自己开。
前八百多公里感觉还可以，吹着牛皮听着DJ，看着风景还觉得挺惬意。

这是从日照到烟台，一大早拍的，有些雾。



基本上三四百公里左右就得找个服务区休息休息。整个白天基本都是我在开。同事陪我吹牛皮。吹了整个白天。

这个图就是下午太阳快落山了。那时候基本上没有别的牛皮吹了。吹得口干舌燥喝水也不管用那种。感觉话说多了舌头磨的疼。



到了前半夜，高速上小车很少了，基本都是大车。而且对面车道的大车绝对不关远光灯，大老远的照着眼睛睁不开。所以晚上开车速度和效率没有白天高。

整段路程，个人感觉最难熬的时候是最后的三百公里。那个时候精神和精力真的已经灯枯油尽了，肚子感觉鼓鼓的，打个嗝也都是红牛味。也没有话题聊了，相顾无言。听歌听得感觉耳朵呱噪的厉害。主要是风噪胎噪的低频噪音吵的脑仁疼。真没办法了，拜托同事帮忙开一段，自己稍微打个盹。谁知道一坐上副驾驶，嘿，清醒了。这玩意怪得很。
还有还有，京哈高速有一段堵车堵的我都怀疑人生！堵了接近一个小时！是一动不动！一开始我俩还老老实实的在车里干坐着。后来旁边的大车司机都下车溜达了，还有互不认识的大车司机互相交换水果零食啥的，还有蹲在路边嗑瓜子的…我俩就下车跟着吹，才知道经常跑这段路的司机堵车堵出经验了，带着扑克打斗地主。

这图是从烟台里程表清零以后到大连跑的距离。中间加了三箱油，换算一下百公里大概7个半，作为一台排量2.5自吸的车，全程高速油耗感觉并不高。（出了山东以后，基本都是乙醇汽油，尤其是大连，没有纯汽油！不是说乙醇汽油成本低嘛？为啥比纯汽油还要贵！！！而且还不经烧，加满一箱油明显跑的距离比纯汽油短个七八十公里，这是经过实测的。不过尾气的味道比纯汽油好闻。据说是年审测尾气的时候，加乙醇汽油比较容易过。）

这是大连中央大道的梦露～




大连街头的哥斯拉。













大连的景色真的超美，随手一拍就是风景美如画。空气还特别清新。想去旅游的小伙伴强推！而且人都很友好。热心的很。我俩办完事儿往回走的时候真的就是开够了车了，一想起还要跑一千多公里回去心里就打退堂鼓。不死心跑去大连码头一问，回复渤海湾提早开了，我俩高高兴兴兴高采烈的俩人一车上了轮渡。




大轮渡超大！装的下好多车！把车开进船里的时候感觉好神奇。




在船上一觉起来天亮了，跑去甲板上拍海上日出。超美。
一觉起来到了烟台码头了。感觉祖国真的太强大了，坐轮渡比开车真的方便太多了。睡一觉就省下了一千多公里的路程。我俩下了船又从烟台跑回日照。两天时间，跑了两千多公里，感觉就是黄粱一梦，只有里程表上的数字，提醒着我一切都是真实的。整段路程，大概有三百多公里是同事开的，省下的一千六百多是我开的。也由衷的佩服那些长期开大货车跑长途的司机师傅。
长途开车，调整一个最适合自己的坐姿真的超级重要！还要买一个那种护颈，要不脖子真的感觉又酸又痛。还要尽量备点热水和茶叶。不能光喝饮料，还是热水最解渴茶水最提神。尽量买点黄瓜和水果啥的，这样没牛皮吹了吃点水果还提神，高速服务区上又贵又不好吃。车况也一定要检查好。油水气电的。还有轮胎胎压。
还有还有还有！之前定速巡航基本上感觉用处不大，上了高速才知道定速巡航有多重要！尤其是长途高速！完全解放右脚！而且还省油！没错，是超省油！轻松太多了！！

这个就是蓝瓶红牛。劲比金罐的大很多，亲测！

                    <span>程序员离不开命令行，许多经典命令是每天必用的，比如ls和cd。
虽然它们很好用，但是由于历史原因，往往也有一些缺点，比如用法不符合直觉、难以配置，有些速度也不快。
这些年，它们的替代品开始出现，而且越来越多，大家开始尝试使用现代语言，重新实现这些经典命令。本文总结一下这些替代品，其中有些真的很不错，值得你在自己的计算机上安装。

一、exa
exa 是ls命令的替代品，可以彩色输出目录内容，更容易辨识。

$ exa --long --git




上面命令中，参数--git表示输出文件的 Git 状态。
N：新文件
M：文件有变动
I：该文件被忽略
除了平铺显示，exa还支持目录的树状显示。

$ exa --tree --level&#x3D;2




exa本身是一个二进制文件，不需要安装，下载后直接使用，速度也相当快。
同类软件还有 lsd，这里就不详细介绍了。
二、broot
broot 可以看作增强版的ls替代品，实际是一个终端里面的文件管理器。
使用时，可以先列出当前目录的文件信息。

$ br -sdph



上面命令中，参数含义如下。
-s：显示文件体积
-d：显示文件时间
-p：显示文件权限
-h：显示隐藏文件。

可以看到，它默认以树状结构，展开子目录。
然后，在这个界面中，可以完成各种文件操作。
搜索：输入搜索词
复制：输入:cp

zoxide 是 cd 命令的替代品，用来切换目录。
它的用法与cd完全一样，进入目录/tmp就是下面的命令。

                    <span>中国人似乎都要过两个年，而这个春节更重要一些。
岁尾，上班的最后一天，办公室非常冷清，我呢，在这敲下这行话。
似乎很久没有随意记录一下心情了，项目关注的人多了，乱写一通难免畏首畏尾，所以正式的内容多了些，而我这个博客的初衷本身就是记录自己的流水账啊，所以想写就写吧。
这两年心态发生了很多变化，好的方面坏的方面，尤其是去年最好的朋友之一选择自己结束生命，总觉得有些不真实，像是有些东西从我的生命中抽走了，再也回不来，想回沈阳看看的时候，少了件事儿，而我们共同的朋友也仿佛约好了一样，不去提起这件事，不去提起他。
新冠两年，科比也走了两年，仿佛这两年很多东西都被抽走，在儿子出生前，和媳妇约好带他出国到日本去玩，结果现在儿子连辽宁都没出过，更可怕的是，我们不知道新冠会持续多久，但大家内心可能都知道，我们再也回不去曾经的生活了吧？
去年做了不少事儿，但总觉得还不够，飞逝的时光，新年到了，这种新年的感觉体现在，超市一排一排的大礼包，酒，坚果。新年到了，虎年来了。
去享受最好的，也准备着随时承受最坏的
想跑马拉松，上一次跑是 19 年的北马了吧，那是我第一次真正意义跑完的马拉松，冲过终点的时候略有遗憾，差一点点进 4 小时，希望下一年有所突破，一下子到了今天。
想把自己曾经的想法都去实现了，想再给自己 10 年，看看未来如何，希望自己别变得油腻，别当爹，跟推上那些闪着光的少年多学习，多玩好玩的东西，让自己的心态变得平和。
想回到从前的身材
想把曾经想读的原版书都读了
想变成一个靠谱的丈夫，一个靠谱的父亲
想多分享，多帮助别人
想多写些文章，特别是技术方面的
想多爬几座山，多跑几个城市
想祝大家虎年愉快，都去乘风破浪
写到这儿吧</span>

                    <span>在几年前下定决心告别 Windows 上的 xx 大师、xx 卫士后，在一段时间内我会感到些许不适。倒不是因为不习惯没有人告诉我开机花了几分几秒，而是这些无所不包的管家们的确能提供一些特别好用的小工具，比如解除文件占用、右键编辑、广告弹窗拦截等等。
好在后来我发现这些小功能可以用一些更简单纯净的应用来实现。本文介绍的就是我搜集到的一些工具，它们绝大部分为便携软件，无需安装、点开即用，体积也非常小巧，大都保持在几 MB 内。
需要说明的是，因为功能场景和所应对的需求特殊，本文提到的大部分应用都会访问系统内核、修改注册表或某些关键文件，因而可能会被一些安全软件误认为是病毒，保证下载来源正规的前提下需要手动将它们添加进白名单。另外，使用前也请做好备份以防万一。
OpenArk：快速定位快捷键和文件占用
相关链接：GitHub | 文档
Windows 应用可以注册两类快捷键：适用于特定线程的快捷键 和 全局快捷键，前者只有当特定窗口被激活时才会响应，而后者则全局生效。当某应用注册的全局快捷键和其他程序调用的按键冲突，应用功能就会异常。
想要知道究竟是哪个应用占用了快捷键，可以打开 OpenArk，进入 内核 &gt; 系统热键 界面，然后选择 进入内核模式。

此时应用会列出已注册的全局快捷键供我们搜索。譬如说，我们需要知道哪个应用占用了 Ctrl + Alt + Up（注意输入顺序），可以在界面下方的过滤器拦中输入相应的快捷键名称，不难发现是网易云音乐注册了此按键组合。接下来，在网易云中做修改即可解除占用状态。

与快捷键被占用的情况类似，我们偶尔也会遇到某些文件无法打开，无法删除的情形。这大概率是因为该文件正在被其他应用使用。OpenArk 同样为此情况提供了解决方案：进入 内核 &gt; 存储管理界面，选择 进入内核模式，键入文件路径，点击查看占用，应用便会展示所有使用了该文件的进程。…</span>

                    <span>RTX3050 知乎首发评测，本文作者为Cloud，我的联合主笔
显卡价格在2021年初矿潮以来就一路飞涨，基本有50%以上的溢价。但现在今天以太币币价腰斩，但显卡价格还是维持高位。这正常么？显卡市场为何如此畸形，以后我们这样的玩家还买的到正常价格的显卡么？本文将通过对RTX 3050的简单评测，来回答这个问题。

RTX 3050采用的是3060一样的GA106核心，但流处理器数量从3584缩到了2560.安培架构每个SM有128个FP32单元，就是说SM数量从28组缩减到20组。

RTX 3060的GA106屏蔽了2组SM,而3050就是屏蔽了10个SM，就是一组GPC的规模。
完整的GA106有3个GPC，一共30组SM，其实照理RTX 3050的规格2组GPC就可以满足，笔记本的3050就是2GPC的GA107，2048流处理器单元，满规格的GA107是3072，其实用来做2560的桌面RTX 3050冗余也很大，良率也应该不会有问题，这样成本会低很多。

我们本次测试的是微星 GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X 8G OC，简单的说就是万图师2风扇丐版。由于带个OC,Boost频率比标准的略高一点，但功耗是锁死的，最高130W，如果是STRIX这样的高规格，则可以再向上拉10%。


双风扇、两热管，对于130W的TDP而言绰绰有余。

输出的接口是标准的DPx3+1 HDMI。

万图师祖传的塑料背板，实际PCB比俩风扇的散热器还短上一截。

单8pin供电，130W功耗一般搭配足额质量过硬的400W电源就可以满足需求，并有一定的余量。

PCIe引脚看上去是完整的，但实际上是8X 4.0的速率。虽然这个影响不至于象PCIe 4.0 4x的6500XT那样明显，但引用Tom&#x27;s Hardware的测试，在部分游戏中还是会有一定的损失。

                    <span>累！刚刚自驾完1000公里，来回答下这个问题。
从广州到武汉全程1000公里，不过我们不是自己“开车”而是全程导航辅助驾驶回去的，虽说是辅助驾驶，但是你以为你就可以躺在驾驶位安心睡大觉了？真实体验比自己开车还要累很多倍。下面给大家看看这次作死全过程：
大家正在紧锣密鼓地准备中11日8时10分


正在出发前的动员大会：首先要确保安全11日9时00分

我们将对辅助驾驶系统的托管表现进行严格的手动计量，周师兄正在检查量表：

正在检查路上要用到的拍摄设备，以便有一个全方位可回放的素材库：

6台车陆续发车：武汉见11日9点30分
正式出发！六台车特斯拉Model 3、蔚来ES8、小鹏P7、理想ONE、摩卡、Aion V Plus陆续从广州天河区高普路出发，1000公里后的武汉见。谁能率先到达呢？

测试车辆已经陆续上了广州龙洞高速路口，现在看到路口车辆已经开始有点堵了：

吉吉老师向同事打出了友爱的招呼：

理想ONE进隧道时退出了辅助驾驶11日9点52分
本次挑战，我们尽可能全程开启车辆的辅助驾驶系统。出发没多久，上高速后的理想ONE辅助驾驶出现了人工接管的提示。

在开放路况行驶时，小鹏P7的辅助驾驶保持良好运行：


不出意外，蔚来ES8上的雨丝，刚上车就进入了深度睡美人状态：

就在雨丝还在睡梦中时，隔壁埃安V Plus的辅助驾驶出现了不稳定的情况，车辆摇摆、加塞刹车不及时。同行车辆还发现埃安V PLUS常在车距很大的位置亮起刹车灯。我们怀疑和雨丝不稳定的梦境有关。
BTW，我们每台车都用同事通过量表记录每台车的辅助驾驶托管次数。

京港澳高速已经出现堵车情况11日10点21分
出现堵车情况，Model 3驾驶员罗老师出现急躁情绪，开始骂脏话。这里劝诫大家：安全第一，快慢其次！开车不要代入情绪，不要有怒路症。

目前的车辆基本还集中在一条路线上：

                    <span>提升驾车舒适度，那必须是全程辅助驾驶啊；爽不爽不用我说了吧（微笑~）
不过大家对自动辅助驾驶还是有很深的顾虑，毕竟这东西可是人命关天马虎不得。为了验证现阶段自动辅助驾驶技术发展到什么地步了，我们前阵子集齐了市面上所有具备驾驶辅助的车，从广州开到武汉，6台车1000公里真实路况测试。
先贴测试结果：

经过一千公里极限测试，老朋友特斯拉Model 3、蔚来ES8、小鹏P7总体保持了先发优势。
特斯拉NoA作为第一个接触到的领航辅助功能，依然在执行表现的拟人化程度上处于领先身位，也是本次测试中最接近人类驾驶、且支持自主变道远离桩桶的车型。
蔚来ES8、小鹏P7近一年的迭代升级非常明显，两者都不如Model 3那般果决，但是相比早期版本来说已经积极许多，两者的风格都相对折中，对于加塞车辆的识别以及避让成功率都比较高，特别注意的是在高精地图加持下能够在执行指令、特殊路况前进行相应的语音、仪表显示，本地化工作肯定要好上许多，驾驶员感觉安心许多。我们认为小鹏P7对于高精地图依赖更为明显，迫切需要解决高精地图覆盖率；而ES8需要提升变道时的预判能力；





其他三位“新选手”这次为我们带来更多惊喜，理想NOA导航辅助驾驶系统相比其它车型时间推送是最晚的，刚刚在一个多月前正式推送，虽然现阶段领航辅助风格非常保守，但是胜在可用性较高，在不能胜任的路段也会积极提示驾驶员及时接管，即便领航辅助占比有所降低，但是这样的策略我们认为是对安全性更有裨益，希望接下来能够提升指令执行效率，让变道稍稍积极一些。





最后来看AION V PLUS以及摩卡， AION V PLUS相对保守，因此较少出现变道出错以及危险境况，整体风格平稳，但是在复杂环境中受影响非常明显，多次出现车道保持稳定性欠佳，“S形”前进、退出领航辅助驾驶的情况；摩卡则略感性格分裂，白天颇为稳重，主动变道不算积极，但是夜间策略又过于激进，虽然总体可用度较高，但出现受摄像头强光干扰退出领航等“小状况”，我们认为，AION V PLUS以及摩卡均需要提升领航辅助状态保持的稳定性。





适度分忧才是领航辅助的正确打开方式
完成1000公里穿越后，必须坦言我们凭借经验丰富的测试员完成了这次非同寻常的冒险，为了安全考虑，郑重不推荐用户在极端路况中全程使用领航辅助驾驶。
同时，我们更有幸能通过“春运长距离挑战”的形式见证行业的快速发展，我们无法预测一年后、两年后还会增加多少款车型，测试多远的距离，但能够明确的是这条路自此已经不再孤单，一路将有领航辅助分忧相伴。





首先，从测试结果来看，我们惊喜的发现，现阶段智能领航辅助已经不再是纯电动车、新势力的专属，势必会有越来越多的车企、车型覆盖这一功能，从2019年到2022年，我们挑战春运的关注点从“能否抵达”变为了“如何抵达”。事实上这6款车型的智能领航辅助功能在常规路段已足够堪用，导航辅助时长占比最高达到91.73%，这样的结果，我们出发前无论如何也没有想到。





其次，我们建议在保证驾驶员注意力的前提下，尝试使用领航辅助驾驶功能，在长距离重复性行驶过程中，领航辅助驾驶功能能够一定程度上缓解驾驶疲劳与拥堵焦虑，目前而言，适度分忧才是领航辅助驾驶的正确打开方式。
最后，经过场景还原与理论分析，我们发现领航辅助在大多数人工接管中都与传感器、算力边界呈强正相关，有理由相信，未来在提升激光雷达、高算力智能驾驶芯片等硬件边界后，领航辅助驾驶感受一定会变得更好。





领航辅助一定是移动出行的未来吗？对此，我们无法立即给出肯定的答案，能够确定的是，经过数年的求索与守望，我们始终惊诧于这个行业蝶变的速度，或许，无限进步才是这个行业永远的未来，你说是吗？

                    <span>重庆在我心中的体量太大，分量太重，所以面对自己的家乡山城重庆 ，心里的感情始终是深沉又复杂的。
既然我的老家离市中心本就不近，而我在成年之后又离开了重庆，所以这个2018年拍摄的20分钟的纪录片，既是我这重庆半土著的自白书；也权当我带你去看那山城在我心里的一半风景吧！
宜下班、躺在沙发上、点起外卖、慢慢看～
前方重庆，本次导航结束！魔幻交通、穿楼轻轨、过江索道，勒些网红打卡地都不能代表重庆


我出生在长江边上的一个小县城，这个小县城有个很随便的名字，叫【鱼洞】。
鱼洞的老城区位于重庆城区以南，长江的上游，是个少有外人打扰，安安稳稳的小地方。

【鱼洞】这名字听似随意，现在细细品来，倒是很具有山城人民直白个性的——因为就是以前这里江底有个洞，洞里面很多鱼，就叫做了【鱼洞】，明明很爽快是不是！？

但记得上高中时，班上曾转学来了俩渝中区的同学（俗称城里人），一问我家在哪儿，老实憨厚的我说家在【鱼洞】，她俩就笑了，说：这名字好土哦~鱼洞~~嘿嘿嘿~~~（我现在脑袋里都回响着这笑声）随即周围的同学都笑了。
我那时候脸皮薄，红着脸抬头一看，发现只有一个文静女生没有笑，她低着头坐在一边假装看着书......刹那间我就觉得她是有内涵的，是个有深度且不一样的女同学。
后来经过一盘问，人家女孩子才羞答答地把头抬了起来，怯生生地说了一句：我家.....我家....我家在...【木洞】......
我硬是没忍住，也跟着笑了。
【木洞】在【鱼洞】下游，源于那里有个山洞，传说洞中藏有鲁班的优质木材而得名，明明也很爽快是不是？

鱼洞这个县城在我小时候，远没有你现在看到的这么大，它和中国其他地区的城乡结合部一样，生活在这里的小镇居民都是在自得其乐，安安静静的生活。

也可能是因为这里有条宽阔的大江和奔流不止的江水，所以不管是在菜市场卖菜的农民，还是在街上凭手艺吃饭的师傅，亦或者厂里上班的职工——那时…</span>

                    <span>太长不看版：
如果发现加班成瘾让工作、家庭、生活满意度降低和身心健康状况变差，可以适时的做一些调整，比如把分给工作的时间试着分给家人、朋友，或者分给一些活动，比如“游泳健身了解一下”。
希望你可以更好的权衡工作和生活，发自内心的工作投入，并乐在其中；而不是强迫性的、“应该的”去工作，去“内卷“。

三千字长文带你深度了解加班成瘾（详细版）：

首先，你真的是加班成瘾吗？
判断自己是不是加班上瘾，先问问自己这几个问题（心理学标准）：


1、 你会想着如何找出更多时间工作
2、你会花费比预期还多的时间工作
3、你工作，是为了降低罪恶感、焦虑、无助及忧郁
4、别人曾劝你减少工作量，但你不予理会
5、如果不准你工作，会让你很有压力
6、会因为工作而牺牲嗜好、休闲活动及运动
7、工作过量使健康受影响


以上是挪威卑尔根大学心理学家安卓森博士（Cecilie Schou Andreassen）研发的量表，专门测量工作成瘾。如果上面 4 项以上的描述，你的答案是经常、总是，那么你可能就是真的病态的“工作成瘾”。


可能有人会有这样的疑惑：爱工作、多挣钱还不好吗？其实真得还分两个方面看。


当我们说一个人“沉迷工作，无法自拔”，我们多半是表达一种对其热爱工作、献身工作的羡慕或崇拜。
但当我们说一个人是“工作狂”时，却是觉得ta虽然花大量时间努力工作，但对工作投入过多，已经影响到正常生活。
两者相差甚远，却又似乎只有一线之隔。





概念区分：沉迷工作还是工作狂？


“沉迷工作”和“工作狂”两个称呼，在心理学研究中一开始都用工作沉迷(Workaholism) 这一个词来加以描述。就像我们生活中见过的工作狂们“狂”点各不相同，早期的研究中研究者们对工作沉迷的定义也很多样。


一些研究者偏向“沉迷工作派”，认为工作沉迷源于享受工作，因而对人有益，比如沉迷工作的人往往有更高的工作满…</span>

一、DataStore 介绍
DataStore 是 Android Jetpack 中的一个组件，它是一个数据存储的解决方案，跟 SharedPreferences 一样，采用key-value形式存储。DataStore 保证原子性，一致性，隔离性，持久性。尤其是，它解决了 SharedPreferences API 的设计缺陷。Jetpack DataStore 是经过改进的新版数据存储解决方案，旨在取代 SharedPreferences，让应用能够以异步、事务方式存储数据。
注意：DataStore 比较适合小数据和简单操作，并且无法局部的更新数据。如果你需要支持大型或复杂的数据集、部分更新或引用完整性，可以考虑使用 Room 而不是 DataStore。
Preferences DataStore 和 Proto DataStore
Preferences DataStore：与SharedPreferences类似，通过键值对存储数据，此实现不需要预定义模式，也不提供类型安全。
Proto DataStore：通过Protocol-Buffers定义存储数据类型以及结构，保证类型安全。
本文重点了解Preferences DataStore。

启动性能是 APP 使用体验的门面，启动过程耗时较长很可能导致用户使用 APP 的兴趣骤减，抖音通过对启动性能做劣化的 AB 实验也验证了其对于业务指标有影响显著。抖音拥有数亿的用户，启动耗时几百毫秒的增长就可能带来成千上万用户的留存缩减，因此，启动性能的优化成为了抖音 Android 基础技术团队在体验优化方向上的重中之重。

本文基于过往对抖音 Android 客户端做启动性能优化的实战经验总结提炼出普适性的方法论，并将该过程中沉淀的工具加以分享，希望能给大家带来一些新的思考。

抖音 Android 性能优化系列往期文章回顾：新一代全能型性能分析工具 Rhea
带着问题出发

假如你要负责优化抖音的启动性能，你会怎样去规划整体的优化方案？你可能会一下子想到很多方面的细节点，比如：要优化主线程耗时、要减少布局层级、要对某些启动任务做按需加载或预加载、要避免主线程 IO、要对线程使用进行优化、还要有分析工具帮助定位性能问题等……
然而，该如何系统性地把这些细碎点组织起来并按照一定的章法来落地启动优化呢？此时，需要我们在具体细节点之上有进一步的问题分解与深入思考，最终形成一套完整的方法论，不仅能覆盖所有细节点，还能切实指导在实战中达成启动优化的效果。切实有效的方法论必然是从实战中经过千锤百炼才能形成的，而抖音庞大的用户基数又进一步保障了方法论的可行性与普适性。那么接下来让我们带着前述问题来看抖音的启动优化方法论是怎样的又是如何应用于实战之中的。
启动优化方法论
抖音的启动性能优化方法论分为五部分，分别是：理论分析、现状分析、启动性能优化、线上验证与防劣化。

这五部分间存在明显的先后顺序，又能闭环达成可持续的启动性能优化，下面将对这五部分做详细阐述：

                    <span>近年来，极简理念时不时会被人们提起，引发了不少讨论，围绕极简理念展开的实践也层出不穷。单纯从少数派站内搜索，每年均有极简主题的文章。这些文章或从数字生活的实践出发，分享自己的极简体系；或从反映极简文化的理论出发，分享改善自己生活的经验；或对「极简」展开追问，反思「极简」的极限和衍生问题。这些文章对我们个人极简体系的搭建提供了不少可资参考的材料，且在操作指导上也比较详实。
与极简相关的站内文章
在落笔前，我在思考是否有必要再分享自己的经验，因为，该说的大多数都说过了，而我自己的体系也许并没有其他人的更好。最终落笔，则是因为想通了以下几点：
第一，纸上得来终觉浅，从《断舍离》这些反映极简理念的书籍中得出的实践不能说不好，但是否适合自己还要另说，「极简」有共性，但实践只能是个人体验；
第二，多数文章都是「自上而下」的实践，先有理论，再有操作，但这篇文章的经验却是「自下而上」的总结，是我在没有读过任何一本极简理念书籍前提下的摸索；
第三，再不济，文章也是对自己这一年来的经验总结，侥幸上了首页还能赚些稿费补贴家用。
文章分三大部分：第一部分写我的极简理念，第二部分写我的实践，主要是数字生活上的一些小实践，最后介绍极简体系的维持。为了便于理解，把理念阐释得有趣一些，第一部分有些天马行空，把各种不同领域的东西「混杂」在了一起，还望大家见谅。
读完本文，如果能对你有所帮助自然是好，如若觉得文章观点偏颇，还望朋友们在评论区不吝赐教。

                    <span>2020，罗技的 MX Master 3 鼠标发布了，我抱着试一试的心态，买了一只。之后越用越发现自己离不开这款鼠标了，不光是因为罗技的驱动和软件，还有鼠标手势和优联。当然也有很多痛点，
下面我就来聊聊我使用这款鼠标一年之后的体验和感受。
外观
MX 系列的外观一向都不是最好看的，但办公的实用性和比较出色的人体工学都让这款鼠标有了独一无二的特点。
Logitech MX Master 3
MX Master 3 使用了大面积的橡胶覆盖在鼠标表面，好处是防滑，但坏处也不是没有。
在经历了我这一年的高强度使用后，左侧拇指的地方出现的明显的磨损，右侧也出现了但不是非常明显，导致手如果有点出汗的情况下会黏手，和新鼠标的差距还是不小的。当然这也是无法避免的，例如当年的微软“大馒头”鼠标在长时间使用后也会磨损的特别厉害。

 
鼠标的其余大部分地方都使用了塑料，手感不错，也没有廉价感，磨损的相对也不算严重。
按键方面MX Master 3分别有常规的左右键，前进/后退键以外，还有一个电磁滚轮、切换键和一个罗技独有的手势按钮。
MagSpeed 主滚轮
比较有特点的是罗技在纵向和横向滚轮上都使用了金属材质，其中纵向滚轮还使用了罗技的“MagSpeed”技术的电磁滚轮，手感体验不错。但是横向滚轮就没有这么幸运了，只是一个普通的无极滚轮，也没有段落感可以调节。
侧向滚轮
鼠标的底部有一个电源开关和连接设备的切换按键，按下可以顺序切换连接设备。并且内置了重力感应，让鼠标底面朝上的时候指示灯才亮起，并且当鼠标朝下的时候会禁用切换按钮，在省电的同时还降低了误触按钮的尴尬。
鼠标底面
体验/软件
其实软件这部分可能没什么好说的，无非就是那些传统的按键自定义功能。比较独特的是罗技可以根据你正在使用的 APP 来设定相应的快捷键。例如我在使用 Chrome 的时候可以把侧键设置成前进和后退，在使用 PS…</span>

心智模型的简短入门
从80年代开始，“心智模型”在学术文献中出现的频率迅速上升。但为什么它被频繁提起？因为它是人类行为的主要驱动力之一。
心智模型是是我们预测我们与周围世界互动结果的一种心智表征*。它是对某人关于某事在现实世界中如何运作的思考过程的解释。它是周围世界、其各个部分之间的关系以及一个人对自己的行为及其后果的直觉感知的表示。Kenneth Craik被认为是第一个提出这个观点的人（1943）。1983年，Don Norman 写了一篇文章，引发了这个词在学术界之外的广泛使用。而在此5年之后，Norman在他的著作《The Design of Everyday Things》中再次提及这个词。此后心智模型开始在设计等应用领域发挥作用。

心智表征*
指的是一种假设性的内在认知符号，能够表示外在现实；或是指一种利用某种符号的心理过程。心智表征可以指实际上并不存在于感官中的事物之心理意象，比如记忆中烧烤的味道；也能够表现那些个体没有经验过或不存在的事物：想像你自己在一个你没有去过的地方旅程，或是有第三只手臂。（来源：维基百科）

转眼间两年时间过去，这场疫情的「突如其来」已经慢慢变成了不少人眼中的「习以为常」，以至于站在 2022 年开头的这个时间节点往回看时，很多人会发现那些以往觉得有些遥远和陌生的工具、方法论，早已融入了每一天的生活、学习和工作中。
对少数派而言，这个帮助我们适应改变、拥抱全新协作模式的工具就是飞书。从最初的浅尝辄止到如今几乎人人都「长在飞书上」，少数派团队内部不同部门在这个过程中也早已根据实际情况发展出了适合自己的飞书使用方法。
因此在本次 2021 年度征文活动的特别赞助伙伴飞书的邀请下，本文中我们也请来几位少数派产品组、编辑部和 Matrix 社区运营的小伙伴，跟大家聊聊少数派是如何使用飞书的。
小团队也可以做起来的评论与库存管理
少数派的网站管理后台是我们自己开发的，网页形式呈现的后台完全满足数据管理的需求，缺点就是无法像应用推送一样及时弹出更新、报错、警告等重要消息，这就有点麻烦了。管理后台即使做上网页实时通知也是通过浏览器做推送，一专注工作的话很容易忽略。管理员和编辑上班了通过浏览器进入后台工作，下班了谁还会守着浏览器呢？
决定将工作 IM 切换到飞书之前，我们当时用的是 Slack，那时也在使用群消息机器人，将一些电商库存信息推送到 IM 平台上。使用飞书之后，我们发现其实可以将更多业务场景下的系统通知都整合进来。

比如我们一直在用的商品库存管理，设置只要某个商品某个规格的库存少于 20，就会自动向电商群组里发消息。而且为了防止消息被忽略，库存少于 20 …</span>

0 写在最前面
2021 年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔 1-2 年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在 …</span>

我是一个不会文笔的糟年轻人，或许和屏幕前的你一样，间歇性灵感爆发，持续性颓废丧志，很多时候看着很多自律的文章，想着自己也可以与他们一样：高效、自律，像一个齿轮一般啮合在自己想要的位置。
但，现实是残酷的，一个紧急的项目，你会失去原本计划的出行；一顿宵夜，让你的每日运动计划直接奔溃；说好的周末充电，结果半夜躺在床上刷着短视频，最终一觉不醒……
这是一篇不是种草，不是测评，也不是鸡汤的文章，不敢说指点到你，或许，可以引起你的共鸣。
谈谈内卷严重的机械圈
我自身读的就是文科，但是大学选专业却是执意选择了机械专业，原因是我的生物实在太差，逼上梁山只能选文科，选机械有自己的爱好，也是固执认为找工作简单（事实确实如此），毕业后很多人选择别的行业，或者在机械圈内做业务等的顶流工作。而我因为在大学已经厌倦了销售类工作，最终还是转向了技术流。
你的第一份工作究竟如何选择
即使我还年轻，但是机械圈真的，太小了，小到你换几次工作之后，你的几家公司的同事会在你的朋友圈互相打招呼，圈小可想而知。很多人对机械圈有着根深蒂固的抗拒，“电子厂”、“拧螺丝”、“找不到对象”，这些固化的印象导致大家对这个圈子越来越抗拒。

如果你决定进入机械圈，我的建议是，毕业之后先进入大厂，有人（某些年长者）会告诉你，进大厂是没有前途的，最后只能靠加班费过活，没有感情的电子厂，完全没有前途。但，我要告诉你的是——
我的第一份工作就是校企联合的招聘，一家港企，做出的设备是国内厂商一辈子的梦想，其在CPU领域与inter的合作基本上就是垄断。到这里估计有人会说，外资完全不当大陆人当人看，晋升渠道基本为0，其实我并不觉得这是对的，外国工程师一样是打心底看不起我们，但是，试问香港几家大学，每年培养多少机械人？如果开发给大陆员工晋升，那估计一年半，整个企业都是讲普通话的大陆人了，所以，很多外企掐住的只是高管等关键…</span>

鬼斧神工119：2022年1月最新耳机选购总结推荐指南2022 年真无线降噪蓝牙耳机推荐哪款？
2022年特别更新
我在留言中看到很多网友反映原文章内容太多过于复杂，看我的章只是想比较明确的获取目前适合选购耳机的信息。其实我的初衷是尽可能详细的展现测评过程，否则结论未免显得过于空洞。不过确实很多人只是想选购一款性价比高的耳机，对于那些基础的概念、复杂的原理不想也没必要花费太多的精力和时间成本去了解。所以在此更新总结今年也就是2022年最新值得考虑的高性价比头戴式耳机推荐。
有线头戴式耳机
森海塞尔HD560S。森海塞尔这款耳机大体表现或者说三频分布相对来说非常均衡。并不会有高频暗淡或者高频整体过亮。4kHz局部突出确实在一些音乐中会有所体现，但有些音乐并不明显。这段音染的范围并不大。并不会出现人声很尖锐的情况。整体人声高频的音染比AKG K701好不少。低频的量感和下潜表现也不错，低频的量感相对来说并不像一些开放式头戴式耳机偏少，下潜作为一款开放式耳机做到这样的程度也绝对是可圈可点的。总的来说我认为这款耳机的调音无愧于广告中的这句话。

虽然这款耳机作为一款开放式耳机。低频下潜和量感表现都不错，但是低频音质比较一般。并且低频的清晰度表现也有些问题，低频稍微有点糊。也就是这一点有待商榷。

此外，超高频有些乐器存在音染和音质问题，或者说有些超高频会稍微给人一种“塑料感”。但超高频的量感和延展并没有明显不足。并且森海这款耳机相对来说没有拜亚动力一些头戴式耳机的齿音问题。瑕不掩瑜，总体而言这款耳机的音质表现优秀，没有严重的硬伤。
这款耳机除了音质以外，个人认为还有一大亮点就是佩戴。这款耳机官方数据下为240g，比HD650轻20g。并且个人佩戴这款耳机并没有明显夹头，不知道是不是因为是热心网友已经用过一段时间的缘故。

操控党之所以留恋汽油味，因为汽油味某种程度上是一道门槛。


「汽油味儿」所指为何？
到2020年，汽车行业发展已经超过130年，而在前120年里，地球上的汽车品牌一直在减少，没有增加。
主要原因是汽车行业是一个高壁垒的行业，内燃机、变速箱将大多数实力薄弱的新兴企业隔绝在外，并逐渐演变成大国国力角逐的主要领域---汽车行业直接决定了一个国家的工业地位。小国即便以举国之力也无法建立一家成熟的汽车企业，为此全球主要汽车品牌都集中在美、日、德、法、中等几大经济体。
虽然内燃机和变速箱构建了汽车行业的门槛，但并不作为汽车企业的核心竞争力。汽车品牌之所以得以传承，在于打造始终如一的驾控风格，这一点在汽车品牌的宣传中显而易见。

宝马在上个世纪30年代首次提出了「乐趣」的概念，并逐渐演变成「纯粹驾驶乐趣」（Sheer Driving Pleasure）。为此，所有的发动机、变速箱都围绕这个概念展开，即便经过了直列发动机到涡轮增压发动机的转变，这个品牌精神一直都在。

福特也在上个世纪中叶提出了「Drive a Ford and FEEL the difference」的品牌概念。这个概念在2000年前后被福特重新重视，并发展为福特的品牌理念。海外为「Drive Difference」，中文为「Feel The Difference」，翻译为「感受非凡」，接着为中国消费者提供了一连串驾控优秀的福克斯、蒙迪欧等车型。
这也就是为什么操控党钟情「汽油味儿」。
电气化之后，新势力涌入，性能虽然非常夸张，通过堆砌电池、电机做出远超内燃机的数据，但操控始终无法令人满意，甚至有些糟糕，只能通过智能体验吸引用户。驾驶风格作为汽车企业的核心…</span>

                    <span>这实际上是一个“功能安全”问题 —— 由于电子电气功能不正常工作而导致人身安全风险的问题。
啥叫电子电气功能不工作呢？ 
比如说，不踩油门它自己加速、挂了前进档车却往后移动…… 这是比较严重的，很可能会出或大或小的事故。
也有一些“看起来不太严重”的，比如仪表黑屏、中控黑屏。 当我还是一名功能安全工程时的时候，我一开始想：黑就黑了呗，车照样可以开，有什么大不了的呢？当年Benz发明汽车时，没有仪表不照样开吗？
我的领导不这么想，在他的引导下，我们使用HAZOP、HARA等方法，分析了“黑屏”的各种可能性：

高速上突然黑屏 → 引起驾驶员惊慌分神 → 部分水平较差的驾驶员，慌乱中误以为动力系统也失效了 → 紧急靠边停车的过程中发生碰撞 → 人身伤亡
高速上突然黑屏 → 驾驶员忘了仪表上还有车速 → 驾驶员在长时间不知道确切车速的情况下继续驾驶 → 对车速判断失误造成追尾或其它碰撞 → 人身伤亡
停车场突然黑屏 → 驾驶员立刻刹停观察现象 → 安全
停车场未黑屏，但屏幕死机了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡
停车场未黑屏，但屏幕卡顿了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡

第五种情况实际上发生过：
车主曝特斯拉“挂D挡往后走”！后台数据公布：前后换挡多达14次
总体来说，传统车企的功能安全工程师认为：仪表与中控都是安全相关的，(至少仪表)功能不能出错：无论任何情况下，既不能黑屏，也不能死机、卡住。
但我想，这要求未免有点太高了。因为过高的可靠性，意味着成本…… 成本最终还是给消费者的。
为此，我曾向多位传统车企的功能安全工程师提出一种不成熟的想法：

 在卖车的时候，提醒消费者“咱们这车啊，在高速上是有可能黑屏死机的；莫慌，继续开即可”。当驾驶员有黑屏的心理预期之后，第一次遇到黑屏也不会慌，从而避免了事故。

关于这一点，我有实际体验：
第一次遇到黑屏时，好慌，大概花了5秒钟我才确认“车子还可以开”、“只是个小事情，镇定”、“导航信息没了，还是赶紧找机会停车重启吧“！
第二次遇到黑屏时，一点也不慌了 —— 因为心里有预期它会黑屏，所以造边停车重启，常规操作了。

 仪表与中控可以失效，但是要求：一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。如此一来，就避免了仪表与中控显示错误的误导而造成的事故。

不出意料，传统车企听了我的想法后都直摇头：你这么做，与特斯拉有什么区别？ 出了事故，特斯拉扛得住舆论，咱们可扛不住啊！
想想也对，这不单单的工程技术的事情，也要考虑车企的公关思路不同。综合考虑后，每个车企只能选择最适合自己的技术方案。
尽管如此，我还是向特斯拉提一个建议，可以让车主更安全： 仪表与中控可以失效，但是一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。

电动汽车高速上死机了，咋办？在线等挺急的！？
亲 特斯拉粉丝宣传死机不影响开车是不是因为特斯拉会经常黑屏啊？</span>

                    <span>前言
哈喽，又是我，欢迎回来「Geek7even《极物研习社》」
2个月前，笔者所在单位进行了办公室搬迁，顺便给所有人升级了一波办公环境▽▼

▲△笔者是个桌搭爱好者，家里两套桌面都走的深色系风格。而在办公室这种明亮的空间，配上浅色的桌椅，便心痒痒想要搭一套简单干净的浅色系办公桌面。想着“给自己一个舒服的工作环境，毕竟一天有1/4都在这里度过“这一借口，剁手起来也没有那么心疼了
桌椅基建
笔者家里卧室是用的西昊M57B，一年多使用下来，坐感舒适，前段时间问了屁股君，它也表示肯定，便随手推荐给了行政。没想到公司一下采购了20来张，用于新办公室的设备升级▽▼

▲△几个大男孩光是安装椅子都弄到腰疼，早知道推不需要用户自行安装的Herman Miller算了（狗头）
西昊M57售价不到千元，这是市场竞争最激烈的细分价格档之一。各大主流品牌都在这一细分价格档推出了不少具有竞争力的产品。甚至光看外表，长得跟几千元的高端款椅子区别也不大（虚荣心作祟）▽▼

▲△金属五爪、透气网面、可调节扶手、腰靠、颈靠，该有的一个不少，性价比非常高。笔者觉得预算不多，但又想体验比较好的人体座椅的时候，瞄准千元这个价位去选择，遇到的坑和雷会少很多
而桌子则统一采购的电动升降桌，原本在用的两张网易严选被我们拉进了黑名单，电机启动时（下降）总有一下顿挫感，桌子用得越久震感越强，实在难受。在线下的办公座椅店逛了一天后，敲定了来自9am的这款企业级电动升降桌产品▽▼

▲△不要被定价吓到，因为走得大宗订单，下单了18件，定制选配1.4米桌板后价格还是比较划算的
9am的pesk系列电动升降桌，是目前笔者摸过用过的电动升降桌中，电机运行最稳定，工作噪音最低的产品了。而且是三段式桌腿，最低高度能到60cm，个子小点的伙伴也不需要被86cm高的桌子折磨

2个月的体验下来，pesk确实贵有贵的道理。电机稳定性无与伦比…</span>
