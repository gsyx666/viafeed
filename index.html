Google’s upcoming Pixel Tablet might support the cross-manufacturer USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) standard, allowing it to be used with a range of third party styluses, if a recently-discovered entry in the USI’s list of certified products is to be believed. The entry, which we spotted via NuGiz, lists a device from Google with the product name “Tangor” and the model number “Tablet,” which are presumably placeholder names for the Android-powered tablet Google announced earlier this month. 
USI is an industry-wide stylus standard that Google joined in 2018. It’s already supported across a range of Chromebooks, allowing them to be used with a variety of styluses from different manufacturers. But while there are plenty of proprietary...

RealityOS — the name Apple is reportedly using for the operating system running on its rumored virtual and augmented reality headset — has appeared in a trademark filing spotted by Parker Ortolani. Bloomberg News was first to report the “reality operating system” branding back in 2017, and references to the name have appeared in Apple’s software. 
The trademark application hasn’t officially been filed by Apple, but it’s common practice for large companies to apply for trademarks under one-off company names — like Realityo Systems LLC, in this case — in the state of Delaware for the sole purpose of maintaining anonymity. 
The trademark application is the latest evidence that Apple is on the cusp of announcing its long-rumored headset. It...

But as the application grows, it is almost always certain that most components deep in the tree will require data from parent/top in the tree components. As such, using props will make the whole app cumbersome. For example,

If the PostItem should require any new data from the parent component, you&#x27;d have to pass the data as props to every single component in-between. This is the reason for state management in React, and React provides a built-in state management solution - React context to handle passing data through descendant components without hav…</span>

Overview of Github Actions - Part 1
Overview of Github Actions - Part 2
It is a Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform allow you to automate your build, test, and deployment. You can build and test every pull request in your repository or deploy merged pull requests to production.
You can run workflows when other events happen in your repository with the help of GitHub Actions. Whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository, you can run a workflows to automatically add the appropriate labels.
If you want to host your own runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure, you can use the virtual machines provided by GitHub.

CSS-in-JS
It’s also important to note that knowing CSS-in-JS is not a replacement for understanding CSS in a stylesheet. CSS-in-JS relies on preexisting knowledge of CSS.
There are many libraries that enable us to implement CSS-in-JS. For some of these libraries, when the JavaScript styles are parsed, CSS is generated and attached to the DOM.
import styled from &#x27;styled-components&#x27;;

These styled components can be defined in the same file or in another file. Since they’re React components, they can be exported or used in JSX.

It is a new service that allows you to query private zones from an on-premises environment and vice versa.
The private resolver requires an azure virtual network. One or more inbound endpoints are established that can be used as the destination for DNS queries when you create an azure private resolver inside a virtual network. The resolver&#x27;s outbound endpoint processes queries based on the forwarding ruleset that you have set. There are networks linked to a ruleset that can be used to send the queries.
The process of using a Azure DNS private resolver is summarized below.
DNS query will issue if the client is in a virtual network.
The DNS query is forwarded to the specified addresses if the server for the virtual network is specified as custom.

Throttle and Debounce solve optimization problems.
Throttle - skips function calls with a certain frequency.
Debounce - delays a function call until a certain amount of time has passed since the last call.
Throttle &amp; Debounce scheme:

1) If the user resizes the browser window and we need to change the content of the site.
Throttle allows us to set a time interval, more often than which the event handler will not be called. If we specify an interval of 1 second using Throttle, then the number of execution of window resize event handlers will be 10.
2) Showing the user the percentage of page scrolling. When the user scrolls the page, scroll events occur, which we need to handle. With throttle we can reduce the number of handled scroll events by setting a time interval.

At ente we self host a bunch of open source tools. While it takes a bit of effort on our part to set up and maintain these, it helps reduce the amount of data we share with third parties. We use Sentry for error reporting, Grafana for monitoring and Metabase for product metrics (to help folks like me who don&#x27;t speak SQL).
While we have systems in place to secure the credentials to these services, we wanted to introduce an additional barrier to entry. The obvious answer was to restrict the visibility of these services to an internal network. But looking at Wireguard&#x27;s landing page made me realize that we&#x27;d need a full-time dev-ops person to go down that path.

  Introduction


Bitbucket Pipelines is a continuous delivery service that helps you build and ship software quickly.
You can use Pipelines to automate the building and testing of your software projects, so that it&#x27;s easier for your team to deliver new features and updates on schedule.
Bitbucket Pipelines are a powerful tool for automations. But if you don&#x27;t know what they are or how to use them, they can be pretty scary. We&#x27;ve been using pipelines for a while now and have learned some things about how to make them work for us. Now we want to share those learnings with you so that you can improve your project workflow! - ( Learn more about bitbucket pipelines )

在之前的一篇《免费的个人博客系统搭建及部署解决方案（Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis）》中，我提到了自己通过 Hugo 这个静态网站生成器来真正搭建我的个人博客，并在 Hugo 开源社区中 hugo-theme-den这个主题基础上进行了一些个人定制化改造和配置，满足了自己的需求。
我的方案主要分为以下几个核心部分：

个人博客源仓库，对博客配置及所有文章 .md 源文件进行版本管理，配合 GitHub Action 进行自动化部署，自动生成静态站点推送到 GitHub Pages 博客发布仓库。
GitHub Pages 博客发布仓库，以 username.github.io 形式命名的仓库，使用 GitHub Pages 实现网站部署，可以通过域名 CNAME 解析使用自定义域名。
Hugo 主题仓库，fork 喜欢的主题，并对自己的个人定制化改造配置进行版本管理，通过 git submodule 的方式链接到个人博客源仓库。
其他组件源仓库，如 umami 网站数据统计及 Cusdis 网站评论系统等。

下文会对搭建、本地测试、自动化部署维护等过程进行详细讲解，希望对大家所有帮助。
使用 Hugo 搭建博客

Hugo 是用 Go 实现的博客工具，采用 Markdown 进行文章编辑，自动生成静态站点文件，支持丰富的主题配置，也可以通过 js 嵌入像是评论系统等插件，高度定制化。除了 Hugo 外， 还有 Gatsby、Jekyll、Hexo、Ghost 等选择，实现和使用都差不多，可以根据自己的偏好进行选择。
安装 Hugo
我使用的是 macOS，所以使用官方推荐的 homebrew 方式进行 hugo 程序的安装，其他系统也类似。
brew install hugo
完成后，使用以下命令进行验证：
hugo version

2017年的时候，我写过一篇使用Apple的Wallet应用制作快捷的微信/支付宝收款码的文章。
最近全国的核酸检测已经趋近于常态化，每次的全民核酸都需要我们出示当地「核酸检测信息登记二维码」，我平常的做法都是：将二维码截图保存到相册里面，然后将该照片加入到个人收藏，方便快速寻找。
但是，我突然联想到之前的这篇文章，那么可以换个思路，以更快更好玩的方式出示「核酸检测二维码」。
 
最终效果
iPhone 熄屏的条件下，双击 Home 键，找到对应地区的核酸检测二维码进行出示即可，就是这么快捷！
Apple Wallet
准备工作

一个二维码：核酸检测登记信息二维码（比如：郑州）
网站一: 二维码解码
网站二: Wallet卡片制作

开始制作

进入网站一，将准备好的二维码上传，把解析结果复制保存。
二维码解码
进入网站二，需要先选择票卡发行服务进行一个账号注册，登入后方可进行后续操作！
点击进入创建新样式页面，选择通用票卡的使用预设范本。
通用票卡
在基本设定里面，将1、2进行自定义修改，然后点击内容设计后，再点击下一步！
内容自定义-基础
在内容设计里面，将方框内的内容进行选择后，调整成自己想要的效果（添加文字或者图片等）即可，再点击下一步。
内容自定义-文字内容自定义-二维码
最后点击下一步，保持默认设置即可，再点击下一步。
发行设置
点击发行
发行前确认
最后就是，添加到Wallet里面了。
添加到Wallet

                              <span>大家好，我是一川，一位非主流的规划设计师，也是一名前书店创业者。在忙碌的主业之余，每年给自己制定阅读计划，每天尽量抽时间阅读，希望通过阅读拓宽生命体验，构建自在平衡的精神小宇宙。我一直以来的愿望都是：To Infinity and Beyond.
第一本想和大家分享的书也是我今年阅读的第一本书——《从零开始的女性主义》，这本书正好也是我今年想要进行主题阅读的其中一个领域：女性主义。

一川开始关注到上野千鹤子，是她在 2019 年东京大学开学典礼上的演讲（B 站上有翻译版），她提到了前一年曝光的东京医科大学入学考试的女性歧视和东京大学学生的性暴力事件，直指日本社会顽固不化的性别歧视，并且说出了广受好评的金句，

“女性主义绝不是女人像男人一样行动，或是弱者试图变为强者的思想。女性主义是追求弱者也能得到尊重的思想。”

后来，我看到其他博主推荐这本国内刚引进的新书，就打算买来看看，本来以为会是一本比较晦涩的学术书，但其实非常有趣。全书采用对谈的形式，对谈的双方是漫画家田房永子老师和上野千鹤子老师。
上野老师属于日本婴儿潮世代，又被叫做团块世代，即 1947-1949 年出生，青年期经历了日本经济高速增长。而田房老师属于婴儿潮次世代，又被叫做失落的一代，也就是 1971-1974 年出生，青年期经历了日本泡沫经济崩溃。上野老师的年纪与田房老师的母亲差不多大，在对谈中正好可以感受到日本女性主义发展的延续性。由于田房永子是一位漫画家，本书中还配有各种小漫画，形象地阐释了复杂的理念和女性在社会中所面临的困境，非常生动有趣。
全书共有五章，一川就挑选一些我觉得有意思的内容，分别给大家介绍一下。
回顾日本女性主义的启蒙
Chapter 1. 女性女人为何如此艰难？
在上野老师母亲那一辈的世代里，女性是不能出门工作的，出去工作、抛头露面被认为是一件丢人的事情，尤其良家女子更是大门不出、二门…</span>

1 、投资润，500W 人民币以上的投资额度，对普通人来说很难吧，一般国内的普通人不是房产就是股票，再不然开个公司有股权。首先是都不好变现，其次是都变现了，出去之后再重拾江山概率太低了吧。（那种国内公司嗷嗷赚钱，个人出国当富豪的类型不讨论了）
2 、技术润，不了解，但是门槛应该不低了吧，不是当年那种拿个 offer 就能拿绿卡的年代了吧。
3 、通过亲友润，首先不是每个人都有，其次有的话，操作起来不是直系的话好像也不简单是不是？ PS：我有个还挺熟的表姐在西班牙，走亲访友过去好搞吗？
在知乎，V 站，还有微博上，无数的人，开口就是一句，华润万家，先润为妙。
咱也不评价润对不对，只是单纯的求证一下润的难度。</span>

2. 简单操作就能同步、管理相册，老人也会用
目前试了 cloudreve 、ifile.space 、可道云
cloudreve:
UI：满意
    上传下载速度：满意
    公共空间： 无，
    相册同步、管理： 无
ifile.space:
UI：不好看
    上传下载速度： 满意，但看不到具体的每秒速度
    公共空间： 无，资料库勉强算但不好用
    相册同步、管理： 有但不怎么好用
可道云
UI：还行，但稍有点繁杂，可以通过设置精简，所以能接受
    上传下载速度：很不满意。和上面两个天差地别，才 2~20M/s ，一般 3M 。搜了搜资料说是基于 php 的硬伤
    公共空间：有
    相册同步、管理：算是有

主要需求：
带宽高（ 50Mbps 以上），要有独立 IP （至少一个），接受共享带宽；
便宜；
主机本身不需要太高性能，不限 x86/arm ，大概树莓派的水平能跑 Linux 就行；
无所谓主机在国内的哪；
有无好推荐？</span>

上海时区也会区分 CST ，CDT 吗？ CDT 不是北美才有的吗
代码如下
package main

import (
&quot;fmt&quot;
&quot;time&quot;
)

func main() {
var Zone, _ &#x3D; time.LoadLocation(&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;)
d1, _ :&#x3D; time.ParseInLocation(&quot;2006-01-02T15:04:05&quot;, &quot;1987-04-01T00:00:00&quot;, Zone)
d2, _ :&#x3D; time.ParseInLocation(&quot;2006-01-02T15:04:05&quot;, &quot;1987-08-01T00:00:00&quot;, Zone)
fmt.Println(d1)
fmt.Println(d2)
duration :&#x3D; d2.Sub(d1).Hours()
fmt.Println(duration)
}


输出如下

x86_64(以下统称 x86)的 mac 打不开 T.T
我的 mac 是 M1 的，版本 12 。编译好之后，给公司不同的电脑测试，只要是个 x86 的不管是 10 11 12 都跑不了，是个 m1 的不管是 11 还是 12 都能跑。请问这种兼容性问题从何入手？
另外我用我的电脑 xcode 新建了一个空工程，编译好之后直接放到 x86mac 跑竟然能跑起来。。。
所以说这是 chromium 工程配置 or 选项我漏了啥，还是说这就是 mac M1/x86 需要特殊处理的地方？
感觉这跟 windows 上差别好大，求大佬解惑！</span>

坐标沈阳，对象去年在本地入职一家北京名头的公司，非特殊行业特殊岗位。公司从今年起便规定：疫情期间请假离沈需要居家十四天，且全部算事假，并会影响晋升。我俩本想着 2022 年 2 月 22 号领证，因为都不是本地户口，需要回到我家（省内），因为这破规定无奈取消了。
现在想 6 月 1 号领证，想着就算少拿一些工资也把整领了，更魔幻的事情发生了：
整个流程走的非常不顺利，沿路设卡
延迟晋升一个月
取消房补
降工资（给出理由是之前没有看出来是民办学校毕业）
想跟大家讨论下，这种规定是否合理合法，有没有维权的切入点，有哪些维权的途径可以选择？

i7-5600u 2 核 4 线程
好像是板载 4G 内存，还有一根 8G ，一共 12G 内存
电脑里有一个闪迪的 16G 固态（很奇怪）
还有一个 Intel 的 360G 固态
目前在这个 16G 的固态里装了 PVE 虚拟机
跑了一个 openwrt 做旁路由，给家里的手机电脑科学用
因为有 100M 上传，就装了一个网心云，用来回回宽带的血
还可以折腾点什么？
我目前想到的是群晖，但是 360G 固态大部分都分给网心了，可以挂移动硬盘来搞群晖吗</span>

如题，我英文不太好，大学勉强四级，而且很多词都忘得差不多了，平时也很少看英文原版文档和书籍，都是看别人翻译好的，翻译的是否通透易懂就完全取决于译者的水平了，好的译者可遇不可求，当然也可能是原本的概念就晦涩难懂，翻译成中文就更加不知所云；

回归主题，老外们在用英文描述一些抽象事物的时候是否更加通俗易懂？如果是这样，我会下功夫好好学下英文，争取以后的技术文档优先看英文版</span>

GET https://www.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api.js?render&#x3D;$site_key net::ERR_TIMED_OUT

查看了一下 stalled 整整 40 秒才抛出错误,然后显示登录页面(当然此时页面并未受到 recaptcha 的保护)
想问问大家有没有比较好的替代验证码方案
(自己找过 mCaptcha/Friendly Captcha 之类的
要么是没有 i18n, 要么就是过于简单形同虚设)
或者是能从服务端解决 recaptcha 无法访问这个问题的办法.</span>

                              <span>roundRobin: 一直在寻找最适合自己的多桌面键鼠解决方案（差生文具多），考虑因素有和平台的适配性，工程学设计，切换桌面流畅度等等，尝试了很多组合，供大家参考。

鼠标：
1. Magic TrackPad
2. Kensington Expert Mouse Wireless Trackball
3. Logitech MX Master 3
4. Logitech G502
键盘：
a. Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
b. HHKB Pro Hybrid Type S
c. Logitech ERGO K860
电脑：
主要使用 M1 Mini ，有时需要切换成 PC
TL;DR
最终选择方案：1(2) + b + 4
经过亲身体验，键盘还是 HHKB 的手感最好，不忍割舍。左手可以搭配 Trackball 或者垫高的 Trackpad 来用最小的手部移动满足基础的指针需求，然后在需要更精准点击以及大量拖拽时可以使用右手的鼠标，考虑到右手的使用场景更少然后 Master3 有时会出现断连 /延迟 /滚轮方向不正确等问题，我选择了更稳定的有线方案 G502 。在需要切换桌面时，HHKB 和 Trackball 可以切换蓝牙，Trackpad 可以通过有线 /蓝牙来切换，右手 G502 就没办法了。
推荐组合：
组合一：1 + a + 4
PROS:
最原生的 M1 键鼠组合，基本需求一步到位，续航完美，有线可以减少延迟，touchID 极大提升输密码环节的使用体验，trackpad 的手势不必多说，用习惯了就离不开了,右手选择最稳定的 G502 。
CONS:
键盘敲击手感一般，手腕无法垫高失去保护，长时间使用不舒服。多桌面支持不佳，只能用蓝牙 /有线来每次进行手动切换。
组合二：2 + b + 4
PROS：
最适合 VIM 用户的组合，键盘不必多说，手感 /布局都是精心设计，长期码字手感顺滑，配上统一高度并且能最小移动手部的 Trackball ，可以在需要精准指针操作的时候最大程度减少撕裂感。两者都支持多平台，HHKB 可以通过有线 /多个蓝牙，Trackball 可以通过接收器 /蓝牙来进行切换。
CONS：
HHKB 如果不是有线连接的话无法唤醒 MAC ，KENSINGTON 的接收器十分不稳定，经常断连，使用蓝牙的话延迟严重。
组合三：（ 2 ） + c + 3
PROS：
罗技工程学组合，一个接收器可以让键鼠同时丝滑使用，K860 的分离式设计和碗托的设计让人爱不释手，Master3 和 Mac 的适配也很完美。两者都支持多桌面，不过由于 K860 不支持 flow ，所以还是需要手动点击切换，不过相比起其他组合已经是最快捷的桌面切换方式了。
CONS：
LOGI OPTIONS 垃圾，K860 的敲击感一般，而且带小键盘导致右手鼠标必须离远使用，因为 Master3 并不适配左手。替代方案是左手使用 Trackpad 或者 Trackball ，考虑到键盘高度，Trackball 最适配。
以上只是个人的使用体验，每个人都有适合自己的搭配，我比较爱折腾所以给大家一些参考，欢迎大家给出自己的方案。</span>

目前，小弟的手机播放器 app 有个视频录制功能，用 ffmpeg 库封装成 mp4 。
现在 ffmpeg 会先将录制的视频缓冲在内存中，等到停止录制，ffmpeg 在硬盘最开始写个 mp4 头部，然后把一整个内存里的视频数据写入硬盘，这样导致内存占用很大，而且还有 OOM 的风险。
所以想要找个能实时将录制的视频数据写入磁盘的办法。有没有大神指点一二？</span>

目前我们的方案就是测试完了手动把测试账号相关的数据进行删除，很明显这不是个好的办法，所以来问问各位 v2er 们有你们项目是怎么处理类似问题的？</span>

自己最近学完一下中间件，想加到以前的做的小项目中，但是整合中发现百度的方案有点杂，很多没有源码，有些跟着搭建起来有到处报错，感觉头直接裂开，求解。
看一些 demo 到 github 有些太大，又看不懂，有些太小总感觉差点什么...
例如自己最近学的 elasticsearch 想整合到 Springboot 中，然后......
想请问大佬一般整合项目，一般怎么弄，或者有什么比较好的资源网站或者其他.....
求解</span>

                              <span>Tails 5.1 将针对“可绕过 Tor 浏览器安全措施的危险漏洞”提供关键修复。以下是它的全部内容。




Tails 是一个专注于安全的便携式 Linux 发行版，最近，它的开发团队发布了有关其当前版本的重要公告。他们警告用户在 Tails 5.0 或更早版本 上使用 Tor 浏览器时，避免输入或使用任何个人或敏感信息。

Tor 浏览器是 Tails 事实上的（默认）网页浏览器，它有助于在用户连接到互联网时，保护他们的在线身份。它主要被各种记者和活动家用来逃避审查。不过，普通用户也可以使用它。

问题说明

最近，有人发现了两个令人讨厌的漏洞，它们允许有害网站能够从其他网站窃取用户的信息。

这些都是在 Firefox 使用的 JavaScript 引擎中发现的。

但是，Tor 与此有什么关系？对于那些不知道的人来说，Tor 实际上是 Firefox 的一个复刻，因此包含许多类似的功能，如 JavaScript 引擎。

具体来说，在 Mozilla 发布的公告 中，这些漏洞已被确定为 CVE-2022-1802 和 CVE-2022-1529。

Tails 公告中也对此进行了说明：


“例如，在你访问恶意网站后，控制该网站的攻击者可能会在同一个 Tails 会话期间，访问你随后发送到其他网站的密码或其他敏感信息。”


你应该停止使用 Tail 发行版吗？

没有这个必要。

用户会很高兴地知道，这些漏洞并不影响 Tor 的连接。这意味着，如果你不交换任何敏感信息，如密码、个人信息、信息等，你可以随意地浏览互联网。

Tails 中的其他应用程序，尤其是 Thunderbird，仍然可以安全使用，因为 JavaScript 在使用时会被禁用。

此外，你也可以在 Tor 浏览器中启用最高的安全级别。这是推荐的，因为（该级别下）JavaScript 引擎会被禁用。不过，请注意，这会使网站无法正常运行。

换句话说，如果你知道自己在做什么的话，Tails 发行版仍然可以安全使用。

漏洞修复即将发布

好的消息是，Mozilla 已经在上游修补了这些错误，现在就等 Tails 团队发布修复程序了。

至于何时发布，他们是这样说的：


此漏洞将在 Tails 5.1（5 月 31 日）中修复，但我们的团队没有能力提前发布紧急版本。


因此，你最好的选择是等待下周的 Tails 5.1 发布。你可以阅读 Tails 开发团队的 官方公告 以了解更多信息。

                              <span>带你一窥生成二进制文件步骤的幕后，以便在出现一些错误时，你知道如何逐步解决问题。


C 语言广为人知，深受新老程序员的好评。使用 C 语言编写的源文件代码，使用了标准的英语术语，因而人们可以方便阅读。然而，计算机只能理解二进制代码。为将代码转换为机器语言，你需要使用一种被称为 编译器compiler 的工具。

最常见的编译器是 GCC（GNU 编译器集GNU Compiler Collection）。编译过程涉及到一系列的中间步骤及相关工具。

安装 GCC

为验证在你的系统上是否已经安装了 GCC，使用 gcc 命令：

$ gcc --version


如有必要，使用你的软件包管理器来安装 GCC。在基于 Fedora 的系统上，使用 dnf ：

$ sudo dnf install gcc libgcc


在基于 Debian 的系统上，使用 apt ：

$ sudo apt install build-essential


在安装后，如果你想查看 GCC 的安装位置，那么使用：

$ whereis gcc


演示使用 GCC 来编译一个简单的 C 程序

这里有一个简单的 C 程序，用于演示如何使用 GCC 来编译。打开你最喜欢的文本编辑器，并在其中粘贴这段代码：

// hellogcc.c
#include 

int main() {
    printf(&quot;Hello, GCC!\n&quot;);

                              <span>ProtonMail 宣布了重塑后的品牌，包括新网站、新名称、新的定价计划、新的 UI 和其他变化。




ProtonMail 将自己重新命名为 &amp;ldquoroton”，以将其所有产品囊括在统一的品牌下。

注意，别把它和 Steam 的 Proton（它也简称为 Proton）混淆哦！

换句话说，ProtonMail、ProtonVPN 和它的任何服务将不再有单独的产品页面。

Proton：一个开源隐私生态系统




Proton 将拥有一个新的统一平台（新网站），你可以在其中访问所有服务，包括：


Proton 邮件

Proton VPN

Proton 网盘

Proton 日历


现在，新的登录会话将会被重定向到 proton.me 而不是 protonmail.com、mail.protonmail.com、protonvpn.com 等等。

不仅限于名称/品牌，整体的强调色和现有的用户体验，也将受到影响。



现在，你只需一次付费订阅即可获得全部服务，而不必单独升级 VPN 和邮件。这也意味着，经过这次改变，高级订阅的价格变得更加实惠了。



总体而言，让 &amp;ldquoroton” 成为隐私生态系统，是为了吸引更多对技术细节不感兴趣的用户来了解它是如何运作的。

你可以在其新的官方网站（proton.me）上查看所有详细信息。

新网站看起来更干净、更有条理，并且更具商业吸引力。

本次更改的内容

你可以期待有一个焕然一新的用户界面，包括新的品牌和新的网站。



除此之外，Proton 还提到它改进了服务之间的集成，以获得更好的用户体验。



如果你已经在使用 ProtonMail，你可能知道，他们正在主动建议现有用户激活 “@proton.me” 帐户，这也是本次更改的一部分。

你可以选择将新电子邮件地址 xyz@proton.me 设为默认值，它更短，看起来也更有意义一些。


旧的电子邮件地址不会消失，只是额外提供了新地址（@proton.me）。

现有的付费订阅者应该可以免费获得存储空间提升。

升级了网页和移动应用中的用户体验。

新的官方网站（你将被自动重定向到它以进行新会话）。

新的定价计划，为 Proton 网盘提供更多存储空间。


你对本次变更感兴趣吗？你喜欢 Proton 的新名字和新的服务方式吗？请在下方评论中分享你的想法吧！

Compiling software is something that developers do a lot, and in open source some users even choose to do it themselves. Linux podcaster Dann Washko calls source code the &quot;universal package format&quot; because it contains all the components necessary to make an application run on any platform. Of course, not all source code is written for all systems, so it&#x27;s only &quot;universal&quot; within the subset of targeted systems, but the point is that source code is extremely flexible. With open source, you can decide how code is compiled and run.
When you&#x27;re compiling code, you&#x27;re usually dealing with multiple source files. Developers tend to keep different classes …</span>

Hasbro has designed a lifelike lightsaber just in time for the premiere of the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series, one that might be the toymaker’s most ambitious — and expensive — replica yet. The Black Series Reva Force FX Elite Lightsaber costs $499 and measures a total of 6.5 feet long with both blades attached. It’s modeled after the lightsaber wielded by the Third Sister, also known as Reva, a cold and callous Inquisitor set on hunting down Obi-Wan.
Just like the iconic lightsabers we’ve seen held by Inquisitors in past Star Wars series, you can take off one of the blades, as well as remove half of the circle in the center of the lightsaber. There are a number of cool lighting and sound effects that you can activate too, and they work...

Apple’s attempt to dismiss an amended antitrust lawsuit filed by the creator of Cydia, an app store for jailbroken iPhones, has failed (via Reuters). California District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple’s motion to dismiss the case on Thursday and is giving the company 21 days to respond to Cydia’s refiled complaint.
Cydia developer Jay Freeman (who also goes by the username Saurik), first filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2020. The complaint alleges Apple “has wrongfully acquired and maintained monopoly power” in iOS app distribution and payments, ultimately “depriving” third-party app stores of “the ability to compete with the App Store.” Cydia emerged before the Apple App Store even existed, and allowed users to find and...

Memorial Day marks the unofficial start to summer in the US. In addition to using the long weekend of this national holiday for travel and taking some well-earned rest and relaxation, it usually kick-starts lots of outdoor activities — like backyard cookouts, road trips to the beach, and camping trips. It’s also another shopping holiday, with discounts on offer for all kinds of home goods and some great tech, gadgets, and gear.
There are plenty of deals on cool outdoorsy gear to take advantage of leading up to the holiday — like BioLite’s current discount on the FirePit Plus.

老王点评：Perl 当年太成功，但这个成功也成了巨大的包袱，以至于激进的 Perl 6 失败了，继承传统的 Perl 7 也迟迟难产。两年前宣布 Perl 7 的消息时，我还 很期待，但是，虽然不愿意这样说，Perl 不如就让它一直留在 Perl 5 吧，作为历史里程碑挺好。




微软将 WSL2 带入 Window Server 2022

2021 年，为了回应用户提出的将 WSL 向后移植到 Windows Server 2019 的请求，微软说 WSL “对开发来说非常棒”，“对 Windows 客户端来说非常完美”。但又警告说，“如果我们把它放在 Windows Server 中，人们会在生产场景中使用它，而它并不准备用于这种场景”。微软推荐的方式是运行完整的 Linux 虚拟机。但今年，微软的态度在改变，WSL2 发行版已经可以在 Windows Server 2004 和 20H2 版本上运行，而现在，随着最新的预览补丁，Windows Server 2022 现在也支持 WSL2 Linux 发行版了。

老王点评：微软对 Linux 的野心一点点露了出来，先是一个号称为了开发者方便的子系统，以后就可能是一个集成了完整 Linux 功能和优点的子系统了，并且，可以用于企业生产环境。




攻击者窃取了十万 npm 用户账号登录信息

攻击者在 4 月中旬的攻击中利用 OAuth 应用令牌窃取了近十万 npm 用户账号登录信息，取得了密码哈希和电邮地址。哈希密码是用弱哈希算法，如加盐 SHA1 生成的，因此容易破解，但好在 GitHub 从 3 月 1 日起对所有账号自动启用了电邮验证，控制账号的尝试会被自动阻止。在分析和检查之后，GitHub 确信攻击者没有修改或上传新版本的 npm 软件包。GitHub 重置了所有受影响用户的密码，并向受影响组织和用户发送了通知。

                              <span>DeepMind 是 Alphabet 的子公司和 AI 研究实验室，在 2021 年 10 月，它收购了用于机器人研发的 MuJoCo 物理引擎，并承诺该模拟器将作为免费、开源、社区驱动的项目进行维护。现在，DeepMind 声称开源计划已完成，它的整个代码库 可在 GitHub 上获得。

MuJoCo 是 “Multi-Joint Dynamics with Contact” 的缩写，它是一个物理引擎，旨在帮助机器人、生物力学、图形和动画等领域的研究和开发（也包括其他需要快速准确模拟的领域）。MuJoCo 可用于帮助机器学习应用实现基于模型的计算，例如控制综合control synthesis、状态估计state estimation、系统识别system identification、机制设计mechanism design、通过逆动力学inverse dynamics来进行数据分析，以及并行采样parallel sampling。它也可以用作标准模拟器，例如用于游戏和交互式虚拟环境。（LCTT 译注：这段话中涉及到不少专业词汇，鉴于译者水平有限，若有谬误，请在评论中指出，同时也欢迎在评论中科普，一起学习～）

根据 DeepMind 的说法，以下是 MuJoCo 适合协作的一些功能：


能够模拟复杂机制的综合模拟器

可读、高性能、可移植的代码

易于扩展的代码库

丰富的文档，包括面向用户的和代码注释 —— 我们希望学术界和 OSS 社区的同事能够使用这个平台并为代码库做出贡献，从而改善所有人的研究


DeepMind 还说：


“作为没有动态内存分配的 C 库，MuJoCo 非常快。不幸的是，原始物理速度一直受到 Python 包装器的阻碍：全局解释器锁（GIL）和非编译代码的存在，使得批处理、多线程操作无法执行。在下面的路线图中，我们将解决这个问题。”


（LCTT 译注： 这里补充了原文没有提及的路线图和基准测试结果。）

路线图：


通过批处理、多线程模拟释放 MuJoCo 的速度潜力

通过改进内部内存管理支持更大的场景

新的增量编译器，带来更好的模型可组合性

通过 Unity 集成支持更好的渲染

对物理导数的原生支持，包括解析和有限差分



“目前，我们想分享两个常见模型的基准测试结果。注意，这个结果是在运行 Windows 10 的标准 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 机器上获得的。”

                              <span>DAML 智能合约语言是一种专门设计的特定领域语言domain specific language（DSL），用于编码应用的共享业务逻辑。它用于区块链环境中分布式应用的开发和部署。




区块链技术是一种安全机制，以一种使人难以或不可能修改或入侵的方式来跟踪信息。区块链整合了交易的数字账本，它被复制并发送至其网络上的每台计算机。在链的每个区块中，都有一些交易。当区块链上发生新的交易时，该交易的记录就会被添加到属于该链的每个人的账簿中。

区块链使用分布式账本技术distributed ledger technology（DLT），其中数据库并不保存在一个服务器或节点中。在区块链中，交易被记录在一个被称为哈希hash的不可改变的加密符号中。这意味着，如果一个通道或链上的一个区块被改变，黑客将很难改变链上的那个区块，因为他们必须对外面的每一个版本的链都要这样做。区块链，如比特币和以太坊，随着新的区块被添加到链上而不断增长，这使得账本更加安全。

随着区块链中智能合约的实施，在没有任何人工干预的情况下，有了自动执行的场景。智能合约技术使得执行最高级别的安全、隐私和反黑客实施成为可能。



区块链的用例和应用是：


加密货币

智能合约

安全的个人信息

数字健康记录

电子政务

不可伪造的代币（NFT）

游戏

跨境金融交易

数字投票

供应链管理


根据 Statista.com，自过去几年以来，区块链技术市场的规模正在以非常快的速度增长，预计到 2025 年将达到 400 亿美元。

                              <span>在 Ubuntu 中重新设置已忘记的 root 用户的密码


这篇简单的指南将向你解释，如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 好 20.04 LTS 桌面环境中，以及从服务器版本中的 恢复rescue 模式中重新设置 sudo 密码。

介绍

在 安装 Ubuntu 时，创建的一个新用户将会带有 sudo 权限，用以执行各种各样的管理任务。

如果你的 Ubuntu 系统有多个 sudo 用户，你能够从另外一个 sudo 用户的账号下，轻松地重新设置所忘记的一个 sudo 用户或管理员用户的密码。

如果你只有一个 sudo 用户，并且忘记了密码怎么办？没有问题! 从 Ubuntu 的 恢复rescue 或 单一用户single user 模式中恢复 sudo 用户密码很容易。

虽然这篇指南是在 Ubuntu 22.04 和 20.04 LTS 版本上进行的正式测试，不过，下面给定的步骤对于其它的 Ubuntu 版本和衍生版本来说是相同的。

在 Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04 LTS 中重新设置 sudo 密码

首先，启动你的 Ubuntu 系统到 恢复rescue 模式下，来重新设置一个 sudo 用户的密码，操作如下面的链接所述。


如何启动到 Ubuntu 22.04 /  20.04 / 18.04 的 恢复rescue 模式 或 急救Emergency模式


现在，进入到 恢复rescue 模式下，通过运行下面的命令，以读/写的模式挂载根（/）文件系统：

# mount -n -o remount,rw /


现在，使用 passwd 命令来重新设置 sudo 用户的密码:

# passwd ostechnix


在这里，ostechnix 是 sudo 用户的名称。使用你自己的用户名称来替换掉它。

输入两次密码：

New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully




就这样。我们已经重新设置 sudo 用户密码。如果你按照上面链接所述的方法 1 进入到 恢复rescue 模式，按下 Ctrl+d 组合键来启动到正常模式。或者，你也可以输入下面的任意一个命令来启动到正常模式。

# systemctl default


或，

# exit


如果你想重新启动系统，而不是启动到正常模式，输入：

# systemctl reboot


如果你已经按照上面链接所述的方法 2 进入到恢复rescue 模式，输入：

# exit


你将返回到 恢复菜单recovery menu。现在选择 “恢复正常启动Resume normal boot”，并按下回车键。



在强调一次，选择 “确定OK” 按钮，并按下回车按键来继续启动到正常模式：



现在，你在运行管理命令时可以使用新的 sudo 密码。

如果我把用户名称和密码都忘了怎么办？

如果你忘记了用户名称，在 恢复rescue 模式下，你可以很容易地列出你的 Linux 系统中的用户名称，使用目录：

# cat etc/passwd


来自我 Ubuntu 22.04 系统的输出示例：

[...]
ostechnix:x:1000:1000:Ostechnix,,,:/home/ostechnix:/bin/bash
[...]


好了，现在，你找到用户名称了。只需要按照上面的步骤来重新设置用户的密码即可。

先补充背景：腾讯云云函数 6 月起需要购买套餐，标准版 12.8/月，折后 9.9
现在云+校园上线了云函数套餐包，标准版三年 3.24 元。非学生，已超 25 岁，也成功购买了（也许是因为几年前买过学生机）
注意事项：
1 、套餐与可用区域绑定，比如买给广州的就只适用广州。目前学生套餐只支持购买：硅谷 /多伦多 /广州 /中国香港 /法兰克福 /孟买 /北京 /新加坡
2 、腾讯云已经不能使用一个实名注册多个账号来享受多次优惠。就是说，你实名注册了两个账号，在 A 购买后，B 就没资格了</span>

之前由于旧光猫桥接的情况下，网速达不到千兆，所以报了故障，师傅今天给我换了个新光猫
型号是：吉比特 UNG221N ，比较新款的吧，我看网上的讨论比较少，最早也就是 2021 年 8 月的
师傅说 lan4 和 3 是千兆，不知 lan2 和 1 是不是，没看清楚
我打算将原来的 R6300v2 放到客厅做无线中继，新光猫设为路由拨号模式，所以就没把它设为桥接试试能不能满速了
想问几个问题：1 、无线中继的话，用 2.4G （ link rate 是 300M ）好还是 5G （ link rate 是 1300M ）好？我发现，如果 UNG221N 的 5G WLAN 是设为“80MHz”的话，R6300v2 搜索不到。要想通过 5G 中继，只能将光猫的 5G 设为“20/40MHz”（这个光猫没有“20/40/80MHz”选）
2 、不知什么原因 R6300v2 无线中继上 UNG221N 后，连接 R6300v2 的无线设备不能获取 UNG221N 下发的 IP 地址，该如何解决？ R6300v2 的 WAN 口能动态获取 IP ，并且可以 PING 通外网。
3 、R6300v2 的 SSID 名称和密码是否应该设为和 UNG221N 的一致？</span>

在 Vultr 买的服务器 然后搭一个 ubuntu 的 v2ray 节点
具体 v2ray 参数如下：
AlterId: 0
Encryption method (security): auto
Transport protocol (network): kcp
Camouflage type: dtls
TLS: null
问题：
无论全局与否，都会频繁出现 Your connection was interrupted. ERR_NETWORK_CHANGE 已经影响正常使用
已知可出现于多个网站，Chrome 和 Edge 都出现了这个问题，甚至国内网站也会出现这个问题。
具体表现为：
输入网址回车或直接搜索后，会出现这个错误，并一直转圈，运气好会直接转入，运气不好就会停止转圈并一直停在这个错误页面。
目前已尝试解决：
更换 vultr 服务器 ip 无效
ipconfig/ flushdns 无效
指定 ipv4 Dns 解析地址 无效
开关网络属性 ipv6 开启后略有好转
关于这种错误我在网上感觉搜不到，求问解决方法。</span>

然后说一下我看上的两款显示器：
一个是明基 PD2705U ，LCD 显示器，折扣价 3999 ，参数看这里： https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id&#x3D;661873145240
另一个是飞利浦 27E1N8900 ，OLED 新时期，折扣价 5499 ，参数看这里： https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id&#x3D;671322466623

                              <span>liqinliqin: 我刚才分享了一个帖子，被人举报推广，为了避免推广嫌疑，
我只说结论和展示数据，
我的目的想说的是抖音确实是个好渠道，大家可以大胆尝试
李博士做抖音一个月，吸粉 1.3 万，成交金额 50 万，经验分享
直接说结论，跟贴出图，
1.抖音上面的人分两类，一是抽精神鸦片的找奶头乐的，二是有自己生意，在上面找客户的。
2.5 秒完播率第一重要，一定要吸引住前 5 秒。
3.点赞评论第二重要，点赞评论越高，推的流量越多。
4.别人合拍的越多，说明视频越受欢迎，流量越多。
我的数据：
我的目标是找客户，因为我们公司有自己的物联网模组、方案产品，我准备推广下直播灯产品，做了如下策划
1.个人 IP 打造，四博第二帅。
2.前 5 秒，抛出疑问，吸引住不走
战果：
发布一周内，3 万播放，6000 点赞，吸粉 3000 ，用我视频合拍的人数超过 100 个，不经意间火了
题外话：
抖音确实牛，我去公司附近饭店吃饭，老板娘非要给我免单，说是抖音刷到我了，不知道以前我是博士，要我给她在抖音推饭店，</span>

A basic WebRTC video audio chat app made using python Flask.
Create and join video chat rooms. The users connects to each other in a peer to peer mesh network using WebRTC. They share their audio and video directly with each other without going through a centralized server. However, a centralized server is needed to initiate the connections at first using a process called signaling. This, signaling server is made using Flask in python and data is shared between server and clients using SocketIO.
For demo &amp; explaination visit: https://youtu.be/ZvG1-s7QmLs

To run this on your machine, install the following:
python 3.x
Flask
Flask-SocketIO
Install requirements using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To start a server on localhost:
python server.py

Access Control Issues arise when we, as normal users, can gain access to data that we are not suppose to access either directly or via malicious methods. This is mostly due to poor data/access protection mechanisms put in place by developers. 🤠
Now, with this section there are three parts. Without any further lollygagging, let&#x27;s jump into it!

When we open the Access Control Issues - Part 1 section on our device we are met with the following objective: try to access the API credentials from outside the app. This means that instead of just clicking the View API Credentials button, we should try and access the credentials on the ac…</span>

Toggle functionality is often built with JavaScript because it requires handling the click event.
But it can be built with pure CSS and no JavaScript.
This video shows you how.

                              <span>Linux is amazing! Let me tell you what made me say so.
There are multiple ways to perform a function in Linux. Let&#x27;s say you simply want to print &quot;Hello World&quot; to the screen. To do so, some beginners might create a new file, write &quot;Hello world&quot; to it and then use the cat command to print the contents of the file. Some experienced users may use the echo command to print the same to the screen. Both of them are correct as the job is done perfectly but the only difference is that using the echo command, we can accomplish the job quickly.
In this blog, we are going to discuss about one such function of creating a new user using two commands adduser and useradd. We&#x27;ll also talk about which command you must use and when.
Let&#x27;s dive right into it.

You can take a configuration snapshot of your pool and then create new pools or clusters based on that snapshot as long as the configuration is supported. 
The snapshot is a resource that contains the configuration information from the source pool. You can use the snapshot resource and the values of the configuration to create a new pool or cluster.
This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. 
You cannot create a new N-Series pool based on a snapshot captured from a D-Series pool because the images in those cases are not the same as the virtual machine family.

                              <span>When working on accessibility, a common issue you might come across is that your HTML tag doesn&#x27;t have a lang attribute.
The lang attribute tells the user which language the page is written in.
Some examples of valid lang attributes are:




In any regular plain HTML website, we would add this tag to the HTML element. However, in the case of Next.js, we don&#x27;t have direct access to it.
So to add this tag, we need to use the next.config.js file.
module.exports &#x3D; {
  i18n: {
    locales: [&#x27;en&#x27;],
    defaultLocale: &#x27;en&#x27;,
  },
};

If your website supports multiple languages, you can even put various values in the locales array.
The default locales are then used to set the current one.
You can even use this config to set up custom domains, but we might dive into that separately.
There is an alternative way of adding a custom HTML tag if you want to override multiple HTML properties.
Inside your pages directory, you can add a _document.js file.
This page will override the default Next.js document.
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from &#x27;next/document&#x27;;

export default function Document() {
  return (
    
      
      
        
        
      
    
  );
}

And that&#x27;s it, two different ways of adding the lang tag in Next.js.

I&#x27;ve tried a few like, mongo, dynamo, firebase, but I don&#x27;t really understand the use case.
Moreover, I&#x27;m not sure if I can maintain the software for the next 3-8 years without problems querying older data.
Am I missing anything?
scaling?
easier change request?
Which kind of project should I use NoSQL?

                              <span>What is JavaScript


JavaScript was initially introduced to add scripts(JavaScript programs are known as scripts) to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser, since it&#x27;s inception all the major browsers have adopted the use of JavaScript. Fast forward to today and you can do much more with JavaScript. When companies started adopting JavaScript, a standard document called ECMAScript standard was written by ECMA International organization to maintain a standard in the language. Theoretically JavaScript can also be called as ECMAScript.
Today, JavaScript is not limited to the browser, you can write JavaScript on any device that has a JavaScript engine (A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code) Some of the popular JavaScript engines are
V8 - used in chrome, Microsoft edge, Opera, Node.js etc.
JavaScript for the browser
PHP for web server
Swift for IOS applications
etc.
With introduction of Node.js, JavaScript become a backend language as well. Node.js was built on top the v8 engine which already supported JavaScript. What makes Node.js standout is it&#x27;s non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient, Node.js can asynchronously continue executing code while listening for other events.
If you are someone new to the world of programming, you could build full stack web applications with the knowledge of one language. Also front-end developers who primarily use JavaScript can work on the backend without learning a new language.
Finally I want to leave this famous quote by Jeff Attwood also known as the Atwood&#x27;s Law.
Atwood&#x27;s Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript</span>

According to our friendly neighborhood teacher MDN Docs: 
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
Function + it&#x27;s lexical environment &#x3D; Closure
Now, we know what a function is and in order to understand Closures completely, we first need to understand Lexical Environment. 
If you already understand Lexical Environment lets move ahead, if not then I already have a dedicated blog explaining Lexical Scope and Environment from scratch, to read it click here ↗️ 
So now you know how lexical scope works.
TL;DR - inner functions can use parent/outer function&#x27;s variables and functions.
This can be shown by very simple example:
function greet() {
  const userName &#x3D; &quot;Maitra&quot;;

Geometriya
Geometriya - matematikaning nuqtalar, chiziqlar, sirtlar, qattiq jismlar va yuqori o&#x27;lchamli analoglarning xossalari va munosabatlari bilan bog&#x27;liq bo&#x27;lgan bo&#x27;limi.
Muhim bo&#x27;lgan mavzular 📌:
✧ 2-D shakllar ✧
...
❍ Doira
✧ 3D shakllar ✧
✧ Transformatsiya ✧
Asosan nima uchun kerak bo&#x27;ladi 🤔
➀ Shakllar grafik dizaynlarda va UIlarda qo&#x27;llaniladi. ✅
➁ Shaklni o&#x27;zgartirish juda tez loyihalashda muhim ahamiyatga ega. Bu animatsiyada ham juda muhim.
➂ CSS yozishda geometriya juda ham muhim hisoblanadi. Geometriyada olgan bilimingiz Websaytda joylashgan shakillarni boshqara olishingiz va ularni istalgan ko&#x27;rinishda ifodalashingizda juda kerakli bo&#x27;ladi.
Geometriya, ayniqsa, frontend dasturchilari uchun foydali. Shuning uchun agarda siz frontda(frontend dasturchi) yoki UIda (dizayner) da ishlamoqchi bo&#x27;lsangiz Geometriyaga befarq bo&#x27;lmang.</span>

We are going to tackle on the key points in flutter thus give a short overview. I am now exciting to start getting our hands dirty with flutter 😊 Let&#x27;s make this tour together.

Flutter is an open source framework by Google and released around May 2017 it is for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
So regarding to previous series, flutter is a framework of Dart and since Dart is exciting that means that flutter is interesting and easy to learn too 😝 woww this sounds interesting right?

                              <span>Nowadays, security is very important on websites and apps. Sometimes, developers make their own backend incorporating their own custom security methods. Other developers use various cloud platforms so that they don’t need to worry about security logic, and these platforms help developers with most secure ways of authenticating users.
We are going to see how you can use Firebase auth service to secure your react APP.
First you will need to set up our own Firebase project through the Firebase Console. To get started, navigate your browser to Firebase Console. Make sure you are logged into your Google account.
Now, click on Add project and follow the simple instructions provided. Once presented with a dashboard, click on Authentication on the sidebar and click on Get Started to enable the module. Now you will be presented with various authentication options. Click on Email/Password, enable it, and save it. We will come back later, let create our react app first.
Navigate to your terminal and use npx create-react-app appname to create a new react app.
npm install firebase react-router-dom react-firebase-hooks 
Now lets go back to the Firebase Console dashboard, click on Project Settings. Click on the third icon () to configure our Firebase project for the web. Here you will see a config file. Copy the config. Create a new file in the src folder named firebase.js, import firebase modules, and paste the config file here.
With this on your react app you can now start to create login and signup forms and use the firebase authentication module.</span>

Computers talk to each other using IP addresses but since humans cannot memorize thousands of strings of numbers so we use Domain names. For example, if we want to buy something from amazon, we think of &#x27;amazon&#x27; and not any large string of numbers.

                              <span>With another day gone, it is time for another Android Pen-test write-up. Today we are going to cover the fourth section of the DIVA APK, Input Validation Issues. When we have an application that does not validate input properly, it makes it easier for an attacker to go ahead and creating input that is not expected by the rest of the application. This has dire consequences, ranging from altered data, arbitrary code execution, or unauthorized data access. Not good!
If you have not seen any of the previous write-ups, feel free to head over to my GitHub and pull anything you want. When you&#x27;re ready, put on your favorite hoodie and grab your nearest drink, and let&#x27;s get HACKING! 👾

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) II: The Sith Lords is heading to the Nintendo Switch on June 8th, as announced at this year&#x27;s Star Wars Celebration event. The sequel to the classic KOTOR RPG is supposed to feature some performance enhancements and resolution upgrades, as well as a Restored Content DLC set to arrive post-launch.

As you might’ve guessed, the Restored Content DLC comes with the content that Obsidian Entertainment and Aspyr Media, the game’s developers, left out during their rush to launch the game in 2004. There’s already a fanmade mod for KOTOR II on Steam that restores some of this lost content, but it’s unclear how similar the official DLC will be when it comes out.

Twitter started testing Circle earlier this month with a limited group, and now it looks like it’s starting to roll out to more users (via Android Police). The feature works a lot like Instagram’s Close Friends, as it allows users to send out tweets to a specific group of people rather than all of Twitter.
To check if you have access to Twitter Circle, update your Twitter app or head to Twitter in a web browser. When you start composing a tweet, you’ll see a dropdown menu at the top that reads Everyone. From here, you can choose Twitter Circle to limit your tweet to a select audience, or you can hit Edit to add or remove people from your Circle. Twitter won’t notify users if you add or remove them.

Ayn, the maker of the Odin Android handheld, is releasing a lineup of what it calls the “most affordable” portable Windows gaming consoles yet (via Liliputing). The cheapest of the bunch starts at just $299 — $100 less than the 64GB Steam Deck.
Ayn announced the news in a YouTube video and a series of posts on Instagram, giving us a look at what we can expect for looks, tech specs, and pricing. While the entry-level $299 Loki Mini comes with 64GB of storage and an Intel Alder Lake U chip, the standard Loki handheld has an AMD Ryzen 5 6600U chip with three different storage options: 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB, each costing $499, $599, and $699, respectively. The $799 Loki Max features an upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 6800U chip and 512GB of storage.

Comcast has received a patent for a smart speaker — one with a very unusual design, to say the least (thanks to @SteveDonohue on Twitter for pointing this out). Instead of opting for a spherical shape that comes with the Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod Mini, or even the rounded rectangular look of the Google Nest Audio device, a sketch shows what appears to be a speaker with a sloped top and a wide base.
Online records show that Comcast first filed for the patent last year, but it didn’t get approved until April 2022. As seen in the sketch, the device seems to have playback controls on the side of the speaker, with an additional button and a small stand on the bottom.

根据一项新的研究，只要对 GPT-3 说一句“让我们一步一步地思考”，它就能准确回答出之前答不对的问题。而且，这并非巧合，研究团队对此做了充分的验证。在论文中，他们还总结了让 GPT-3 能逐步思考的 9 个最有效的短语，比如，“首先”、“让我们从逻辑上思考一下”、“让我们分成几步来解决这个问题”等等。这些关键词可以将准确率提升 70% 以上。

GoodWill 勒索软件强迫受害者帮助穷人和病人

安全研究人员发现了一个名为 GoodWill 的勒索软件组织，与寻常的勒索软件旨在骗取钱财不同，该组织似乎是为了促进社会正义而不是个人牟利。GoodWill 勒索软件是用 .NET 编写的，一旦感染它会让受害者完成三个社会正义活动以获取解密密钥，比如捐赠衣物、带穷孩子吃饭、给没钱治病的人援助等。完成三个任务之后运营者会核查验证然后提供完整解密工具。

Chrome 被质疑在识别钓鱼网站方面不如 Firefox

有机构近日表示，Chrome 浏览器无法识别绝大多数的钓鱼网站。他们对新近发现的前 800 个钓鱼网站进行了研究，Windows 端 Chrome 浏览器只阻止了其中的 28%，macOS 端只阻止了 25%。而 Firefox 分别为 85% 和 78%。但谷歌公司对此结果存疑，因为 Firefox 也主要是依靠谷歌的安全浏览 API 来阻止网络钓鱼，他们说，“使用相同检测技术的浏览器在其提供的保护水平上存在有意义的差异是非常不可能的”。

老王点评：确实不太可能。我们得承认，谷歌等浏览器厂商合作建设的安全浏览 API 对阻止钓鱼等恶意网站很有作用。</span>

                              <span>在 5 分钟内将你最喜欢的 GNOME 桌面打磨得更精致。


你可以使用图标、主题、光标和壁纸等多种方式来定制你最喜爱的 GNOME 桌面。本文向你展示了如何使你的 GNOME 42 桌面看起来更精致。在最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和 Fedora 36 上提供了 GNOME 42 桌面环境。

在你进一步阅读之前，先看看调整之前和之后的外观比较。





我将把本教程分为两个部分。

第一部分涉及设置和安装所需的软件包。然后第二部分是如何应用各种设置来获得你想要的外观。

本教程主要在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上测试。但是，它应该适用于 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 的其他变体。

将 GNOME 42 定制得更精致

设置

首先，为你的系统启用 Flatpak，因为我们需要安装扩展管理器来下载本教程所需的 GNOME Shell 扩展。

因此，要做到这一点，请打开一个终端并运行以下命令：

sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


完成后重启计算机。

然后从终端运行以下命令，来安装扩展管理器应用以下载 GNOME Shell 扩展：

flatpak install flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager


打开扩展管理器应用，并安装两个扩展。第一个是 “浮动停靠区Floating Dock”，它提供了超酷的停靠区，你可以在桌面上的任何位置移动它。第二个，安装 “用户主题User themes” 扩展来帮助你在 Ubuntu Linux 中安装外部 GTK 主题。





接着，使用以下命令安装 Materia 主题。你必须构建它，因为它没有任何可执行文件。在 Ubuntu 中依次运行以下命令进行安装：

git clone https://github.com/ckissane/materia-theme-transparent.git
cd materia-theme-transparent
meson _build
meson install -C _build


此外，请从 这里 下载 Kora 图标主题。下载后解压文件，将以下四个文件夹复制到 /home//.icons 路径下。如果 .icons 文件夹不存在，请创建它。



除了上述更改，从 这里 下载 Bibata 光标主题。下载后，解压文件夹并将其复制到相同的 /home//.icons 文件夹中。

除了上述之外，如果你想要一个与上述主题相匹配的漂亮字体，请从谷歌字体 下载 Robot 字体，并将它们复制到 /home//.fonts 文件夹。

最后，再次重启系统。

配置

打开扩展管理器，启用 “浮动停靠区Floating Dock” 和 “用户主题User themes”，并禁用 “Ubuntu Dock”。



此外，打开 “浮动停靠区Floating Dock” 设置并进行以下更改：



此外，打开 GNOME 优化工具GNOME Tweak Tool，然后转到外观Appearance选项卡。设置以下内容：


光标：Bibata-Original-Ice

Shell 主题：Materia

图标：Kora


除此之外，你可能还想更改字体。为此，请转到字体Fonts选项卡并将文档和界面更改为 “Robot 10pt”。

或者，你也可以从 Ubuntu 22.04 的默认设置中更改强调色和样式。

最后，根据你的喜好下载漂亮的壁纸。对于本教程，我从 这里 下载了一个示例壁纸。

如果一切顺利，你应该有一个漂亮的桌面，如下图所示：



享受你的精致的 GNOME 42！干杯。

                              <span>惠普正在以开箱即用的 Pop!_OS 为特色进入 Linux 硬件市场，貌似有点激动人心？还是先来看一看吧！




System76 不是早就自己生产 Linux 笔记本电脑了吗？那么，这次和惠普合作是怎么回事？

嗯，这一次是惠普要发行一款 Linux 笔记本电脑，搭载 Pop!_OS，也就是 System76 的基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版。

Carl Richell（System76 的创始人）在他的 Twitter 上宣布了这一消息，并附带了一个网站链接，该网站提供了更多相关信息。推文如下：


Hp-Pop 好耶！来看看这个：https://t.co/gf2brjjUl8


HP Dev One：专为开发者打造的 Linux 笔记本电脑

一方面，System76 笔记本电脑与 Pop!_OS 有着开箱即用硬件兼容性，因此它备受赞誉。

另一方面，Pop!_OS 也与笔记本电脑完美搭配，适配没有太多麻烦。

Pop!_OS 也一直在推出更新和新增功能，以改进工作流程并充分利用 Linux 的可用硬件。

此时，和惠普合作听起来是一个提高档次的好主意。



所以说，Pop!_OS 和惠普合作的想法有点激动人心啊！

挂上了惠普这个牌子，笔记本电脑的可用性/保修（在纸面上）就比 System76 要好了，考虑到后者在某些地区是不提供保修的。

AMD 驱动的笔记本电脑可帮助你更好地写代码

HP Dev One 似乎是把“为开发者提供多任务处理的能力，从而快速完成任务”作为卖点。

这款笔记本电脑的入门款搭载了 8 核的 AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 处理器 和 16 GB RAM（DDR4 @ 3200 MHz）。

预计它还会搭载由 AMD Radeon Graphics 提供支持的 14 英寸全高清防眩光显示屏。

对于 HP Dev One，Carl Richell 提到了这款笔记本电脑将通过 [LVFS][5]（Linux 供应商固件服务）接收固件更新。

他还提到，这款笔记本电脑（以上规格）的定价为 1099 美元 起。

网站上只显示了它即将推出。因此，我们目前还不知道正式的发布日期。

对于像惠普这样的商业制造商来说，笔记本电脑的定价听起来并不令人兴奋（LCTT 译注：毕竟不是国内互联网品牌的笔记本），但可能是一个划算的交易。

你怎么看这款惠普笔记本电脑（运行 Linux、为开发者量身定制）的定价？你觉得这个价格合理吗？你对这款笔记本电脑有什么期望呢？

                              <span>Biwood: 
首先这个插画肯定是有问题，问题在于审美方向是成人化的、西方化（现代化）的，而不是像我们小时候的教材那种纯真的、朴实的风格。当然，有些自媒体在里面添油加醋，把事情扩大到“境外势力”的层面，其实也没必要。要知道人民教育出版社是教育部下面的直属机构，我们以前的教材都是他们出的，给他们一万个胆子也不敢乱来。
我认为根本原因还是在于审美趣味的错位。不知道你们有没有看过一些欧洲的漫画或者动画电影，我自己感觉这些插画有浓厚的欧洲漫画的影子，而且欧洲的不少漫画都是面向成人的，既不像日式那种卖萌，也不像美国迪士尼动画那种简单和幽默。
人教社插画创作机构“吴勇工作室”中的吴勇，属于 80 年代上大学学习美术那批人，而 80 年代正是国门刚刚打开，西方的东西快速涌入进来的时候，很多学艺术的人都深刻的被影响到了。其实不仅仅在绘画领域，包括电影、音乐、文学等各个方面都高度西化，欧洲文化的影响力尤其高，文艺青年们应该知道我在说什么。不得不说，欧洲艺术那套审美就是比较沉重、克制、写实以及深思的，你们看张艺谋、陈凯歌他们早期的电影风格就知道了。这种审美可以说比较国际化，不是说它不好，只是面向的人群更多的是成人，而非儿童。
而我国当前的主体意识形态（社会主义）也是从欧洲传过来的，这种意识形态其实也是比较知识分子式的审美，我猜测人教社的某些管事的人可能也把这种审美视若珍宝，所以才会选用吴勇工作室的这套插画。
然而，这套审美最大的问题就是不接地气，作为成人作品，剑走偏锋，有个人风格是好的，但是作为儿童作品，反而缺少那种简单、纯真、温馨的感觉。把这套画风生搬硬套的放到教材里，显然是非常不合适的。
在这方面，吴勇就不如日本的动画大师宫崎骏了，宫崎骏老爷子的作品也是受法国漫画影响，里面也有浓厚的左派理想主义意识形态，但是画出来的东西就很童真、充满了想象力，完全没有丑陋和奇怪的感觉。</span>

MacOS 12.4 ，OneDrive (appstore 版），Mac Mini 2018 （ Intel 处理器）
自从更新 MacOS 12.3 同时更新了新的 OneDrive App 以来，OneDrive 就一直是资源占用大户。刚开始时是内存和 CPU 占用都很高，上个月更新 OneDrive 后，内存占用的问题好像基本解决了，但是 CPU 一直在 100%到 200%之间。
OneDrive 里大概存了共 50-60GB 的文件，所有的文件都已经同步了。OneDrive 每隔一会就“处理文件更改”，这时就 CPU 占用率就 200%左右；不“处理文件更改”时，CPU 占用率就在 100%左右。
试过 ResetOneDriveApp.command 两次了，没有解决问题。
谁知道怎么解决这个问题？给个方法呗。</span>

为什么来 V2EX 发帖
是希望能够得到 V2EX 上面爱折腾的软件工程师们的关注，比如在Gitee和Github给我们 star 。
Q: 为什么用 Gitee ？
Gitee 在审查上有一些恶名，但是如果发布在 Github ，很多不科学上网的用户就无法通过官方渠道下载到我们制作的软件。我们期望用户是非工程师背景的中学教师。
如何通过工程师专业技能帮助我们
我有如下困难：
macOS 版本目前只支持 macOS&gt;&#x3D;10.15 ，因为不是专业的桌面软件工程师，我对如何让我的软件可以在旧版本 macOS 上面能够运行比较困惑。而且我没有旧的设备，即使我通过某种方式制作了安装包，我也无法验证。
Ubuntu/Arch/Debian/Deepin/... 各大发行版
目前正在联系一位 Debian 社区的朋友帮忙提交到 debian 仓库，我自己也是 debian 用户
希望别的平台的用户能够了解到这个软件，帮忙制作安装包，比如 ArchLinux 的 AUR
希望有更多的小伙伴作为软件工程师，加入我们墨者实验室，这个非盈利的兴趣驱动的自由的松散的小组织
想和 Emacs/LaTeX 这些软件一样，构建一个开发者 /使用者的社区，这是我目前最感兴趣的事情。
墨干编辑器 V1.0.4 是 V1.0.x 系列最后一个版本，将会是是墨干编辑器的里程碑！
墨干编辑器的宗旨
总结一下墨干编辑器 V1.0.4 和 GNU TeXmacs 2.1.1 的三大区别：
① 墨干编辑器优先服务教育，尤其是中学教育，基于 TeXmacs ，从软件本身角度上讲，墨干编辑器会尽力降低 TeXmacs 的使用门槛。
② 墨干编辑器是墨者实验室旗下结构化编辑器，将会和墨者实验室旗下墨客星球深度集成。墨客星球致力于解决网络上 TeXmacs 文档匮乏的现状，是科技和教育领域的内容平台。
③ 墨干编辑器 V1.0.4 基于 GNU TeXmacs 2.1.1 定制，采用高性能的 S7 Scheme 脚本引擎，并且已经升级到了 Qt 5.15.x 。
重要变更
经过多次迭代，S7 Scheme 脚本引擎对于初级用户的常用功能来说，已经十分稳定流畅
2021 年十份高考数学试题真题（例如：示说网 PDF 在线查看：2021 年浙江高考数学试题）
基础数学结构和希腊字母的输入方式，并配有B 站教学视频合集（共六个 10 分钟以内的视频）
插件： 修复 Gnuplot 插件若干问题，并录制 Gnuplot 插件安装和使用两个教学视频，可用于中学教育中函数图像的绘制
插件：  内置 200K 以内的欧几里得绘图软件可执行文件，欧几里得插件默认可用（ Windows 平台仍需从应用商店安装 Python ），可用于中学教育中的平面几何教学
修复了困扰 TeXmacs 中文用户多年的中文输入法漏字（非期望提交上屏）的问题 
修复了 帮助→查找→文档 弹窗使用中文输入法直接崩溃的问题 
修复了远程文档中非 TeXmacs 文档链接的跳转问题，V1.0.4 开始，非 TeXmacs 文档链接可以直接跳转到浏览器打开 
修复了分段函数的排版问题，由于该修复是临时解决方案，暂时没有反馈到上游 GNU TeXmacs 代码仓库
易用性： 在右键菜单中顶部增加了复制、剪切、粘贴三个菜单项，更加符合用户日常使用习惯
易用性： 在中文文档中，新增一系列按键序列转化以方便输入①②③，例如：@1 用于输入①
易用性： 调整了一些 TeXmacs 的默认配置，比如默认使用 Emacs 快捷键，具体请看发布会视频

后来也尝试过 zoho 的付费的邮箱(应该是最便宜的那个) 但是只允许单个用户, 虽然可以用公共邮箱来实现 添加多个用户, 但是这些账户好像是不能使用 smtp 发信的。
cloudfalre 的 email route 貌似只能收 不能发
网易的 貌似 不太靠谱,都转收费的了
现在用的是 飞书的邮箱, 好像限制很少, 可以添加多个域, 一个人可以添加多个邮箱。不知道能用到什么时候

我的以下观点由最近大火的王心凌和可达鸭发散而来。
当下的 B 站充满了某音、某手的特征，标签几乎要被点满。本来国内只看 B 站的，但是这样下去，B 站迟早变成下一个某音。是叔叔真的缺钱了吗？热门里，以及我们难以发现的某个角落里，充斥着大量蹭热度的“王心凌”话题视频。与前面“王心凌”视频类似，“可达鸭”的很多视频也是蹭热度，篇幅短小又无趣，几十秒甚至一二十秒。太太太娱乐向了，叔叔能通过这些流量挣到钱吗？没有广告怎么挣？如果不能或者挣的少我想谈谈我的意见——
有没有一种可能，限制 UP 主每个月的发布数量，主要是视频作品的限制，限制数量再加上限制时长，一分钟以内的视频每个月最多发布 3 篇，这样应该能减少平台的作品量，总体提升平台视频的“质量”。
但这样似乎很难给 B 站带来收益，所以还是一个非常复杂的问题。如何找到一个绝妙的商业模式，充分满足视频质量数量、平台、ugc 的 u （ user/uploader ） 以及更多 public view 的观众的需要。
长视频都很难见到了，根据我的了解，现在也就科技区，学习资源区（各种教程甚至初高中的课程学习、纪录片之类的归类于此），数码区（勉强算上）、DIY 创造作品区能够输出比较有干货的内容，往往这些人能够沉淀下来做一些事情，在现在这个快节奏、快消费的网络时代，什么都来得快也去得快。
我是希望小破站越做越好的，但是像现在这样长期以往不加一个有效的管控措施的话，最后任其恣意生长，最后就是下一个某音。变成某音有什么不好的？
到最后我认为不如直接向 YouTube 看齐，引入比 YouTube 更少量的广告（ youtube 的广告量似乎有点过分，但人家是面向全球用户的），但是能带给平台和 UP 主甚至于普通用户都有更多的好处。
要改变，但做这样的决定，还是非常的难。</span>

有些 Windows 下的操作习惯，不知道 MacOS 怎么实现？
访达，在缩略图列表下多选连续排列的文件。Windows 下只要按着 shift 键，就可以连续多选文件。但 MacOS 下似乎只有列表方式才能这样选，如果是缩略图模式，则不起作用，shift 相当于 ctrl 了，是一个个多选的。
MacOS 缩略图模式下，能否选中一个文件，快速显示它的大小、分辨率等信息？ Windows 只要把鼠标移上去就会显示。
MacOS 能否多选 N 个文件 /文件夹，显示这些文件 /文件夹的总大小？我发现如果多选文件 /文件夹，右键显示简介，会每一个都打开简介窗口。Windows 是可以右键选属性显示总的大小和数量情况的。
如果访达做不到，有没有第三方的应用可以方便做到这些操作？</span>

最近 618 临近，想给 MacBook Pro 配一台显示器，其中有一条要求是能用一条 Type-C 线实现充电（ 60w 或 90w 都行）、4K 60Hz 显示信号传输和 USB 3.0 数据传输。然而我发现虽然很多显示器声称支持一条线实现充电、显示信号传输和数据传输，评论区有用户反馈若仅使用一条 USB Type-C 线，USB 数据传输只支持 USB 2.0 的速率。所以我想知道：
如上的坑是显示器的问题，还是线的问题？
如果是显示器的问题，如何从参数判断显示器满足如上需求？

想用 acme 申请 Google 的 SSL 证书，但是国内好像没有办法连接 Google 的 API 服务，用 Hosts 也不行。
在 cloudflare 搞了个 jsproxy 但是 curl 一下会返回代理页。
想问一下大家有没有什么好的解决方案。
需要请求的地址：https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/directory
应该返回的数据：
{&quot;newNonce&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-nonce&quot;,&quot;newAccount&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-account&quot;,&quot;newOrder&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-order&quot;,&quot;newAuthz&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-authz&quot;,&quot;revokeCert&quot;:&quot;https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/revoke-cert&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;termsOfService&quot;:&quot;https://pki.goog/GTS-SA.pdf&quot;,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;https://pki.goog&quot;,&quot;caaIdentities&quot;:[&quot;pki.goog&quot;],&quot;externalAccountRequired&quot;:true}}

经过 jsproxy curl 到的数据：

实际的问题、情况:
从 Podcast 里点开“本地下载“后，依然可以看见很多是被系统自动下载的集数（并非手动选择下载，一些英语新闻我根本不感兴趣，也不存在误点，因为一个频道往往一口气能自动下载个五六集甚至更多...)，这导致我常常需要花费精力狂删 podcast 下载集数，因为自动播放完一集后常常会跳转到完全不感兴趣的音频

想要把自己的视频作品单独放在一个可以给国内用户访问的连接上，视频每条不会超过十分钟，数量低于 10 个，用 hevc 压制的话空间以工大概就 600MB 。加上 VP9 的话简单的翻一倍四舍五入 1.2G 。一年可能也不会超过十个人访问，所以流量也不需要很多。不喜欢用 CDN 因为他们的计费方式不适合个人，虽然有免费额度，但是如果额度不够的话会欠费，并没有直接停止服务的功能（怕被刷流量）。酷播云啥都好就是有奇怪的审核限制（并不是不想接受审核），比如不给放游戏视频。Wistia 可以放三个视频，确实太少了！如果它是空间来算的话（ 比如 5G 甚至是 1G 都行）就完美了，不想放在 bilibili ，优酷有超多广告。不知道大家都是怎样存放这种数量不多，展示性质的视频的。</span>

本人主要使用 visual studio 2019 和 2022 加上 vsvim 插件从事 C++开发，vs 的补全和纠错做的还是非常出色的，不过我一直想尝试使用纯 vim 或者 neovim 进行开发，但是遇到一个痛点无法解决，公司平台大量依赖 Qt+ACE 框架，工程化主要以 Qt 而非 CMake 进行管理，在 vim 下尝试使用 ccls 、clangd 作为后端 lsp ，效果都很不理想。</span>

Automation is a hot topic right now. In my day job as an SRE part of my remit is to automate as many repeating tasks as possible. But how many of us do that in our daily, not-work, lives? This year, I am focused on automating away the toil so that we can focus on the things that are important.
Home Assistant has so many features and integrations, it can be overwhelming at times. And as I’ve mentioned in previous articles, I use it for many things, including monitoring plants.

The recent collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin caught the crypto market by surprise. For people who saw Terra as a more secure asset compared to other, more openly volatile cryptocurrencies, and invested heavily in the coin or its associated Anchor protocol, they are now dealing with the aftermath as they let go of assets to try and make up for their lost nest eggs.
A report by The Wall Street Journal on Friday told the stories of several of these investors, including one doctor who explained how the fall of TerraUSD is affecting his family’s future.
Keith Baldwin, a 44-year-old surgeon who lives outside New Bedford, Mass., saved $177,000 during the past decade. Last year he took his savings and bought USD Coin, putting it in a...

Workers at the Cumberland Mall Apple store will no longer hold a union election in June, according to a report from Bloomberg. The Communications Workers of America (or CWA), the union attempting to organize the store, says it withdrew the request to hold an election because “Apple’s repeated violations of the National Labor Relations Act have made a free and fair election impossible.”
The vote, which was scheduled to begin on June 2nd, would’ve been the first union election at a US Apple store had it gone through. Now, that title will go to a store in Maryland, barring that petition also being withdrawn. Workers at the Towson Town Center store are set to start voting in person on June 15th.
The union says Apple intimidated workers and...

                              <span>During day two of the weekend-long Star Wars Celebration event, we got a first look at the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order, called Jedi: Survivor. It’s expected to launch in 2023 for the PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.
Cal Kestis, who happens to be the galaxy’s least interesting Jedi (especially when Cere Junda is right there), is back, kicking space fascist ass with the help of his extremely cute droid helper BD-1. The Jedi: Fallen Order series follows Cal as he works to rebuild the Jedi after the infamous Order 66. The sequel takes place five years after the original game and is once again described as a “third person, narrative-driven action-adventure game.” Director Stig Asmussen says the sequel will include some next-gen features as...

As it occasionally does, the company formerly known as Facebook has produced a new revision of its Terms of Service and updated its privacy policy. The old Facebook Data Policy is now Meta’s Privacy Policy, rewritten “to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer.” 
With this revision, Meta “is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and we still do not sell your information,” according to the company. Instead, this update tweaks the language and adds examples to help people understand what each segment is about.
“the status quo is not good for privacy”
After reading through the new policy and comparing it to the old one, this appears to hold up, for better or...

Diablo Immortal is hell, literally, but playing it doesn’t have to be. Ahead of the game’s June 2nd release date, the Diablo team at Blizzard talked about some of the accessibility features they’ve built into Diablo Immortal to make hell that works for everyone.
Controller support was something really important to bring to Diablo Immortal.
“You will be able to play Diablo Immortal with controllers on both mobile devices and on PC,” Blizzard wrote in its accessibility blog. “Many controls — including skills, accessing chat, and more — can be remapped from the controller tab of the settings menu.”
In addition to controller support, Blizzard is also sending Diablo Immortal reviewers a Razer Kishi controller that turns your phone into a...

Nintendo has promised to fix an annoying bug that’s cropped up in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, a Nintendo 64 game that’s available via Nintendo’s Online Expansion Pack subscription. According to NintendoLife, the bug makes it so players can’t move if they’re hit by certain enemies or items in the game’s underwater levels. The only way to fix it, according to people who say they’ve experienced the bug, is to exit the level.
The issue seems to be caused by Nintendo’s emulator, as players report that they don’t remember it happening in the original version of the game or in other ports (it was available through the Virtual Console on the Wii and Wii U). In a tweet on Friday, the company said that a patch to fix the issue “will be released...

The servers for the Dark Souls series have been offline for PC players for months due to a remote code execution (RCE) exploit that could let hackers take over your computer, but developer FromSoftware is in the process of restoring the servers, according to a PC Gamer article published Friday.
“We are currently in the process of restoring the online servers for the Dark Souls series on PC,” FromSoftware said to PC Gamer in an email. “We plan to restore online service for each game progressively, bringing back servers for Dark Souls 3 once we complete the necessary work to correct the problem. We will provide additional updates as soon as the restoration schedule is finalized. We want to thank all our players for your patience and...

In addition to a recap of Stranger Things’ previous chapters, the new season starts with a short message explaining that while production on Stranger Things 4 wrapped in 2021, viewers may be disturbed by the parallels between scenes from the first episode and the real world Texas school shooting that left two teachers and 19 school children dead. In the days leading up to Stranger Things’ season 4 premiere, Netflix had previously uploaded the scenes in question to YouTube as a teaser, but the video has since been pulled down. Netflix’s...

Google’s latest Chromebook update adds a feature that tells you if your USB-C cable has limited functionality, the company announced Friday. USB-C cables can have widely varying capabilities, offering things like different charging and data transfer speeds on a cable-by-cable basis, so this new Chromebook feature seems like it could be a useful tool to help troubleshoot issues. 
“Eligible Chromebooks will notify you if the USB-C cable you’re using won’t support displays, or isn’t performing ideally for your laptop,” Google says in a blog post. “You’ll also get a notification if the cable you’re using doesn’t support the high performance USB4 / Thunderbolt 3 standards that your Chromebook does.” The new feature is coming first to...

Samsung is reportedly scaling back the number of phones it’s planning on producing in 2022, from 310 million to 280 million, according to SamMobile, which cites a report from Korean outlet Maeil Business News. In absolute terms, that’s still quite a lot of phones, but it’s a relatively sharp decrease from the company’s original goal (and from the reported number of phones it and its partners produced last year). It seems that there may be a trend of manufacturers preparing for the economy to get worse before it gets better.
Reportedly, the lowered production targets will affect phones across its lineup, from low-end models to flagships. In a way, cutting the production of its less expensive phones sounds counter-intuitive — wouldn’t more...

Accessory-maker Shargeek has launched an Indiegogo to fund a 35W USB-C charger shaped like a tiny Apple Macintosh computer. The page for the Retro 35’s crowdfunding campaign is very careful not to mention the name of Apple’s classic computer, but it’s drawn some very obvious inspiration, from the beige color scheme down to the placement of the disk drive. The device is eventually set to retail for $49, with Indiegogo “early bird” pricing starting at $25. 
As increasing numbers of phone manufacturers have stopped shipping charging bricks with their devices, aftermarket chargers are becoming more popular. Often, these bricks offer additional ports or higher charging speeds compared to their first-party equivalents, but it’s fun to see...

                              <span>Gucci is making its presence inside of Roblox a little more permanent. The fashion brand previously collaborated with the virtual world for more short-lived experiences, like the surreal Gucci Garden from last year, and is now releasing a more persistent space called Gucci Town. The space features a central garden that links together various areas, including a space for mini-games, a cafe, and a virtual store where players can, of course, purchase virtual Gucci gear for their Roblox avatar. (The company says the virtual outfits make use of Roblox’s new “layered clothing” tech.)
Gucci says that more than 20 million players visited the garden last year, despite it only being available for two weeks, and it expects the new space to steadily...

Valve has responded to a campaign from Team Fortress 2 players who want it to fix the game’s bot infestation that has made it almost unplayable in recent years. “TF2 community, we hear you!” the company tweeted from the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account. “We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.”
Currently, Team Fortress 2 is suffering from huge numbers of automated players on its public servers that are ruining the game for legitimate users. According to IGN, bots will post endless spam in chat, snipe other players with unflinching accuracy, and even crash servers entirely. Last year, podcast Reply All dedicated an entire episode to the issues plaguing the...

If you’re having trouble accessing Instagram right now, you are not the only one. Reports across the internet (Downdetector, Reddit) note issues with Meta’s more-than-just-pictures app, with many people seeing screens saying they’re not logged in, blank image posts, “Welcome to Instagram” messages like they have a brand new account, or feeds that stop loading after the first few pictures. Many Verge staffers are seeing similar issues while trying to access Instagram.
Just before 9PM ET, Instagram said the problems have been resolved, so the apps should be working for you again. In a statement given to The Verge, Instagram communications lead Seine Kim said “Earlier today some people were having trouble accessing Instagram. We resolved...

Valve’s latest SteamOS update is a big one for Steam Deck fans — and I am literally talking about the fan in the handheld gaming PC. One frequent complaint about the Steam Deck is its at-times loud and high-pitched fan whine even while playing lightweight games. Some, including my colleague Sean Hollister, have tried a DIY solution to fix the whine, and iFixit’s replacement Steam Deck fans are already sold out despite being on sale for less than a week. 
With SteamOS 3.2, though, Valve introduced a new OS-controlled fan curve that’s intended to make things better. “This means that overall it’s smarter, more responsive to what’s happening on and inside Steam Deck, and quieter — especially in low usage situations,” the company said in a...

                              <span>做 Android 的朋友都知道，在 Android 中，限定子元素大小的方法有三种，分别是 match_parent、wrap_content、fixed size。如果使用 ConstraintLayout，还会有 match_constraint。
这些值被设置到子元素的 layout_width 和 layout_height，由父元素解析生成 LayoutParams 设置给子元素，并在父元素的 measure 过程中使用它们以及父元素得到的 measureSpec 来确定子元素的大小。虽然子元素的大小最终由父元素决定，但父元素几乎不会违背子元素对自身大小的期望。因此你可以认为在 Android 中子元素的大小可以由子元素自己决定。子元素想要什么大小，给自身的 layout_width 和 layout_height 指定不同的值即可。
而在 Flutter 中，就完全不一样了。Flutter 积极组合的设计，希望一切布局都尽量通过组合的方式来实现。组合优于继承这是真理，但 Flutter 却走向了极端。连指定子元素的大小、padding、margin、translate、background 等等都需要通过嵌套来实现，这就是导致嵌套地狱的根源。
以指定子元素的大小为例，你需要给子元素套一层 SizedBox，通过它来限定子元素的大小。基于此，你可以理解为在一般情况下，Flutter 中子元素的大小无法由子元素自己决定，始终由其父元素决定，这和 Android 有本质的区别。
Flutter 也没有提供 match_parent 来让子元素撑满父元素，wrap_content 来让子元素内容有多大就撑多大。但是它提供了 double.infinity。我们一般使用它来让子元素撑满父元素。但其实 double.infinity 也用来表示 wrap_content。…</span>

【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 叁】键盘事件与手势操作 (本文)
1. 键盘事件
Flutter 作为跨平台的开发框架，本身有键盘的监听行为。Flame 中的键盘事件也只是对 Flutter 原生的一层封装而已，还是非常好理解的。这里我们先来实现如下的效果：按 Y 键时，让角色以自身中心沿 y 轴 反转； 按 X 键时，让角色以自身中心沿 x 轴 反转：代码在 【03/01】

首先介绍一下 Flame 对键盘事件的封装，可以看出是以 mixin 的方式提供回调实现的。注意一点，因为只是 on Game ，示意只有 Game 一族的类才可以混入。

前面知道 FlameGame 中混入了 Game ，所以是 Game 一族。这里 TolyGame 就可以混入 KeyboardEvents 。然后通过覆写 onKeyEvent 方法，来监听键盘事件。其中 RawKeyEvent 有两种类型：RawKeyDownEvent 表示按键按下；RawKeyUpEvent 表示按键抬起，代码如下：
----&gt;[03/01]----
class TolyGame extends FlameGame with KeyboardEvents{
  late final HeroComponent player;

                              <span>经历了长达两个月的居家隔离，上海朋友们终于可以不用吃“蛤蜊炖蛋”（上海话“隔离等待”的谐音）。解封、允许外出的小区越来越多，在超市、医院甚至进入小区都要出示“随申码”，这个时候出示健康码的速度就成了避免人群积压的重要因素。那么本文将会给出我的两个方案。

 方案一、快捷指令
快捷指令打开健康码已经不是什么新鲜事了，这里也不多赘述。但我更加推荐下载“随申办”，它自带两个快捷指令：“随申码”和“扫一扫”，相较于支付宝的快捷指令，“随申办”App提供的快捷指令无需应用内跳转、速度更快，“秒开”buff加满。
“快捷指令”中“随申办”App提供的数个功能
PS：建议下载应用后，进入App内“设置”-“通用”-关闭“启动动画”。

方案二、利用“核酸码”制作Wallet钱包凭证
Wallet钱包想必是除iTunes Store以外各位大陆iPhone用户第二少使用的自带应用。但是，假如我们将“随申码”放进钱包后，它就不仅仅是一个刷交通卡、Apple Pay时才会想到的App。此外，双击电源键即可打开也是原生App的一大优势。
众所周知，全国大多数健康码都是实时刷新的，这样增加了安全性，但是也要求使用时一定需要用户联网等要求，限制了使用场景，于是乎上海市市政府在去年10月推出离线随申码功能1，针对的是60岁以上老人、有残疾证的上海户籍市民以及18岁以下的未成年人。只需要去街道社区服务中心、银行等配备“一网通办”综合自助终端的服务点，凭身份证即可领取为期180天的“随申码”卡片，以便弱势群体在线下场景减少不会用手机的“痛苦”。
在本轮疫情期间，为了便于社区进行核酸筛查，“随申办”推出了“核酸码”功能——有效期为一个月的静态核酸登记用二维码。但在自己本人的测试下，扫描后会显示“离线随申码”的字样。以此可以判断出，其实上海市大数据中心允许每个人都有“离线随申码”，但它只是披上了“核酸码”的外衣。于是它静态的特性也方便我们采用不同的方法。

接下来我会讲述如何制作Wallet凭证：
下载Pass2U；
 
 
 在“票卡商店”中搜索“离线随申码”，就可以找到相应的模版（或者自己做）；

 
将核酸码的截图上传，并填入自己的姓名、核酸码有效期等信息；
一定要将“显示”选项关闭，否则二维码的内容会显示在其下方。
点击“完成”。
制作出来的Wallet凭证
到这一步，你就可以优雅出示随申码了！

进阶（下篇文章细讲）
我制作的凭证
这是我使用MakePass做出的Wallet凭证。如果对外观、功能等有更高要求的话，可以使用MakePass制作，不过这价格嘛～ 慎重考虑。</span>

                              <span>记得我的上一台带有Ace字符的手机还是OPPO Ace2，当时其定位为超级玩家。现在时隔近两年后，一加携手Ace系列高调“回归”，并在4月份发布了首款一加 Ace系列产品。随后又在不到一个月的时间内，推出另一款一加 Ace 竞速版。

这种看似“俗套”的机海战术，让我不免有了点反感的小情绪，但是当一加 Ace 竞速版的性能与价格公布时，发现我还是太年轻。既然一加已有精品路线的数字系列，为何不能有性价比的游戏向产品？那么Ace的回归不正是用于填补这部分的空白吗。
接下来，我们就来聊一聊这款起售价不足一千九的一加 Ace 竞速版，最便宜的256GB天玑8100手机，天玑8100MAX+5000毫安电池+67W快充，官方吹说是2K价位段性能真香机，是否真的诚意十足。
以下内容为真实体验分享，希望能给各位小伙伴带来参考。

性能表现
性能这块，一加 Ace 竞速版采用了定制版联发科天玑8100-MAX，LPDDR5+UFS 3.1超快存储组合，配置最高达12GB+256GB。天玑8100的性能优势相信各位都有目共睹了，而相比天玑8100，这颗天玑8100-MAX针对游戏稳定性和AI计算能力进行了全面优化，能大幅度提升用户日常使用的流畅体验，而玩起游戏来自然也是游刃有余。

在新版安兔兔中，一加 Ace 竞速版轻松获得811848的总成绩（CPU：191517，GPU：313205，MEN：158259，UX：148867），测试时峰值温度35℃。而在鲁大师中，最终得分也有931439分。从跑分情况上来看，CPU和GPU的表现属于中偏上的性能，超过了大多数骁龙870机型。

使用红外测温仪检查跑分时的发热情况，其中正面热源主要集中在上半部，最高温度约41.8℃左右，屏幕居中位置约37℃，而背面最高热源是位于摄像头处，温度约40℃左右。可见金刚石8层散热系统确实有着不错的降温作用，即使…</span>

写在前面
这两年，「双向链接」简直就是知识管理领域的流量明星。
资本追捧它，认为它具有巨大的商业潜力。2020 年，Roam Research 收获 A 轮融资 900 万美元，估值超两亿美元，投资者中不乏资本圈的知名人士。几款亲民的平替软件，如 RoamEdit、Logseq 也在 Roam Research 耀眼的光辉下，承其精华顺势而生。一些具备强大的链接功能，又做出自身特色的知识管理软件，如 Obsidian、Remnote 一跃而起，在各自领域收获了一批忠实粉丝。传统的行业头部软件也不甘示弱，优雅简约的老牌大纲软件 Workflowy 已将反向链接和镜像复制功能完美嵌入，小而美的日程管理软件 Agenda 在 v14 更新里也把双向链接功能加进新版本。此外，我们非常熟悉的、主打 Database 功能的 Notion，和主打颜值的块编辑器软件 Craft 也毫无悬念地都支持双向链接，加上一些我们熟知的国产软件，双链笔记家族的规模可谓前所未有地壮大。时至今日，一款立足文档编辑或知识管理的软件绝不能对双链功能视而不见，毕竟后者的地位早已从一个有附加值的亮点功能，变成了许多用户的「一票取舍」。
如果我们再往下思考一步，就会发现无论是概念层面，还是实践层面，「双向链接」都是早已有之的东西；功能上，很多双链能够做到的，其他方式也能轻松替代。但不得不承认的是，键入双括号构建双链的丝滑便捷又是真切可感的，「双向链接」这个功能的确给笔记软件增添了前所未有的使用体验，许多深度体验过的用户不是无脑尬吹，而是发自内心地喜爱和推荐这类产品。…</span>

I have heard “WordPress” probably more than “Django or Ruby on Rails.” Later, I found out that this is not just random luck. WordPress will be used by 43.2 percent of all websites on the internet in 2022. This represents an increase from the previous year by 39.5 percent. That means WordPress is used by two out of every five websites. There are too many reasons for this success, and I will dictate each one with the relevant sections.

Let’s begin with two building elements of WordPress — the template/themes and the plugin system. Both of these are generic terms that are not only confined to WordPress or web development but also automation frameworks or native app devel…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m 1 month away from graduating with a BSc in software engineering. I&#x27;ve always seen myself as a freelance developer but that is kinda hard to start with and even if I wanted to work with a company, their demands will be 1yr experience at minimum.
Although I don&#x27;t have that much of professional work experience, I&#x60;ve done a few projects that verifies my skills.
The question is how can I start my freelance career(or corporate career) giving that internship opportunities hardly exist in my country (Egypt) and nearly everyone want seniors with 5+ yrs. It&#x60;s really disappointing.</span>

If yes, then you would know how the development of voice assistants in our lives has made it easier since it requires minimal effort. Forecasts suggest that by 2024, the number of digital voice assistants will reach 8.4 billion units, a number higher than the world’s population, and 31% of smartphone users worldwide use voice search at least once a week.
A voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses voice recognition, language processing algorithms, and voice synthesis to listen to specific voice commands and return relevant information or perform specific functions as requested by the user.

Today I’m going to recap all the most important announcements around DevOps made by Microsoft at Build 2002

To me, Everything started with this Twitter thread and from that article, by Ben Kehoe:
 
When dealing with CLI or SDKs, we are already used to putting IAM credentials in the .aws/credentials file.
However, as correctly stated cluttering the credentials file with many credentials is not the right move to make.
This article aims to overview what IAM Principals are and the better ways to manage your programmatic access to AWS.
Moreover, we&#x27;ll focus on the Credential Process. We&#x27;ll see that we can polish our local usage of AWS Principals with it.
Let&#x27;s dig into this journey through AWS authorization systems.

I recently got a notification about my 5 years on dev.to. It hit me really hard, as I was not active here once I switched careers from scientist to software engineer. 
Back then, dev.to was a startup, I was amidst going from being a Technology Wizard at a high tech perovskite solar cell technology company towards my own startup, which is kinda in zombie state now - we did invent smart functional materials that can be used for a Black Panther suit, amongst other things. 
Some year later, I was freelancing and looking for a job. 3 and a half years ago, landed my current job. Now - I&#x27;m here.
Whats your story?</span>

                              <span>Time estimation in software engineering seems to be the most difficult task.
Time estimation becomes a bit easier for well-managed projects where most of the design decisions have been made and there is enough internal tooling and resources. But it is still not perfect. Things become more difficult for teams with limited resources and external pressure on deadlines. More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.
When it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge. It becomes worse if there is no external motivation or revenue potential for the project. Building something for fun or learning might end up in an unfinished project that never sees a launch day.
Side projects should be straightforward by design…</span>

                              <span>what should I know before learning Java


Well, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)

I am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. 
If you are a beginner, please don&#x27;t use any kind of IDE.
 IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. 
It is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. 
As using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. 
So you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. 
This learning method is slow but very effective. 
Although you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. 
You can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.

然后内置的屏幕刷新率是 59hz 60hz 两个选项
新买了个显示器用 surface dock 连接 刷新率没有 59 这个选项只有 30 50 60 120 240
这导致了一个问题 使用扩展的时候没问题 内置的是 59/60 外置的是 60
但是使用复制 内置的是 59 外置的也变 59 了
外置就有明显的画面撕裂和掉帧 鼠标晃动还有拖影
单独用内置和单独用外置也都没问题
就是复制不行 复制的时候死活不让选 60
即使让外屏做主显示器也不行</span>

                              <span>olin6520: 上海华为 2012 高斯实验室，base 上海浦东，是做数据库的，我们项目组主要为华为自己的设备开发数据库（路由器等），编程语言是 c ，不过招聘对语言没有要求，目前 HC 很多。目前主要招聘对象是 OD （华为外包里面最高的一个层级吧） ，学历要求是 211 及以上；社招的话需要职级能够达到 16 级及以上，并且最好有数据库背景。
关于 OD 的网传的区别对待，就我个人（不是 OD ）主观感受而言我们部门 OD 和正式员工没有什么明显的区别对待，可能是一些流程比如请假方面有所区别，并且基本过了专业级（华为内部的一个考试）就一年转正，我们组去年 4 、5 月份进来的一个同事现在就在走转正流程了；薪资上也不会有很大的差距，主要还是按照职级来定的，OD 也有和正式员工相对应的定级。
我们项目组整体技术氛围比较好，带队的是一个高校的教授，所以大家学习的氛围是比较好的。工作强度方面，周三、五早九晚五点半，其他是到晚上八点半，不过大家一般九点以后走。一个月固定一次周六加班，是双倍工资的；其他周末一般不怎么加班，除非工作很急，而且这个加班也是可以上报调休的。
最后欢迎大家联系我，HC 真的是比较充足的，最近新入职的也很多，简历请发邮箱（ base64 ）：b2xpbjY1MjBAZ21haWwuY29t 。</span>

本人使用了 M1 芯片的 iMac 数月，在连接到外接显示器（ Dell P2721Q ）浏览一些暗色图片和视频的时候，有很大概率触发屏幕闪烁。
本人试过以下方法，均无明显改善：
1 、更换连接方式：包括 USB-C 直连，官方拓展坞转 HDMI
2 、升级 Mac OS 操作系统：最新 12.3.1 依然有此问题
另外：
1 、涉及 Mac 机型：M1 及其衍生芯片的所有 Mac
2 、 涉及显示器型号：与外接显示器品牌无关，网友表示 Dell ，AOC ，LG 等品牌显示器均有此类问题，但自家 Studio Display 显示器似乎无此问题

只是根据 v2 会员的帖子的一种推测。如果是真的，确实不可思议。
利用居住登记信息构建名单，分情况执行下列二者其一，或混合执行：
第一种方案
预备一小部分人员推行假旗行动，准备境外电话(或和运营商配合显示为境外电话)，冒名诈骗者进行“诈骗”。
注意上一步的重点是，必须让用户接到电话并利用话术维持一定通话时长，方便下一步攻击用户心理弱点。如果真的存在这种神级的反诈系统，目的是防止诈骗，它将有能力在通话连接前阻止，然后发短信通知用户。
挂断后立即由派出所作为正面角色，上帝视角，用诈骗的核心技巧：声称自己了解部分隐私信息（通信保密的通话内容诈骗），及时抓住用户的不安全感，威胁欺骗用户和犯罪分子有某种联系，然后逼迫用户立即按照致电者说的做，否则承担后果。
第二种方案
随机欺骗用户接到了诈骗电话 /安装了敏感 app/访问违规网站，用户核实时无法发现证据，部分命中者声称此系统有效，以加强可信度和未命中客户的不安全感。
不知道论坛是否有反诈 app 的行为分析？</span>

我想，有些网站存在解决了百分之 80 的问题，能提高很多的工作效率，那它应该是一个比较好的网站，至于商业模式，我觉得没有企业是做慈善的；对于国内的程序员，我想并不是所有人都有很好的英语阅读能力，比如我。
其实说白了，能解决问题的工具，它就是好工具，哪怕获取的步骤，繁琐一些。如果有能力去看官方文档，那肯定是最好不过的。选择自己最适合的方式是就行。</span>

坐标广州，这两天在考虑买不买公寓。
黄埔某集团的新一期公寓新盘开售，在地铁站旁边，均价 1w/平，产权 70 年（住宅用地），可以落户，不占用购房名额。可以一次性付也可以分期付（最低付 3 成，后续分 5 年还清）。
目前自己还买不起住宅，对 28m²、34m²的两个户型比较感兴趣。打算先购公寓自住，过 5-10 年自己有能力买房再把公寓租出去。不知道这样的想法是否天真。
看网上主流的观点都是不建议买公寓，认为是个大坑，比如不带学位、商用水电、转手难等问题。
有没有买过公寓的老哥，来讨论下值不值得买。</span>

V 站大多都是久坐、熬夜、抽烟喝酒、应酬、劳心伤神一众同胞。
我从去年开始系统养生，陆续接触八段锦、武八段锦、八部金刚与长寿，现在依然在系统的完善养生体系。
今年 33 岁经常被人误认是 95 后，思索之下决定陆续公开我的养生积累日志，欢迎有同好一同留言探讨。

非带货.本人体重有点大,座椅的坐垫又不是网面的,夏天坐久一点屁股就开始出汗,还有味道,试了很多坐垫,目前这两个的组合是最满意的

下面是一个 usb 五风机吹风坐垫,上面是陶瓷凉席坐垫,吹风坐垫设计的有问题,整体坐下去会导致风口被堵住,就吹不出风了,加一个支撑的坐垫就可以实现全程都出风,屁股下面有空气对流.
试过到处打广告的&quot;空气纤维坐垫&quot;和&quot;硅胶坐垫&quot;,效果非常不好,空气纤维的号称透气,然而没有对流会积热,和羽绒服一样保温了;硅胶垫号称超软,问题也在这里,通气口看着很大,真坐下去就直接堵住了,根本不透气,而硅胶更是热的不良导体. 传统的麻将凉席也尝试过,开始还凉爽,和体温同步后也就是个实心垫子了.
这套方案也是有点问题的,我还想着用 3d 打印整个坐垫玩玩,实现空气对流和末端风力加强,可惜不会建模,如果各位有更好的方案,也希望能分享一下,毕竟夏天真的太痛苦了</span>

3.今天在微信公众号上面申请公网，客服给我说要开通(公网双栈业务 20/月)，我说具体不清楚这是什么业务，让他们技术打电话过来和我说清楚，中午电信打过来，问清楚了，是公网 IPv4+公网 IPv6 。
1.我想问有和我一样的吗？

   1.日常上下班(次数很少,周一到周五或许只有 2 天需要开车)
   2.周末出游,自驾附近的比如南澳半岛这种地方去游玩
    
二:
1.过年过节回家(重庆),自驾,所以优先考虑混动(长途使用)
    2.有自动或者辅助驾驶功能(查了资料说.辅助驾驶在长途的时候利于休息)
    
三:
1.之前在群里问过,大部分推荐 SUV 或者 MPV.小弟第一次买车不了解想问问有啥区别
    2.情侣出游.比如清远 /桂林比较长途的地方
    3.优先考虑混动 &gt; 燃油 &gt; 纯电(最后考虑 /租房没有私人充电桩)
4.比较倾向于全款,这样没有负债需求.如果有好的推荐,贷款首付 4-6w 也可以考虑</span>

马上 618 了，从去年开始的装修也快接近尾声了，目前还剩下一些家用电器没有买，就等 618 了，因为去年在 618 上面买了冰箱和洗衣机，确实要比平时划算，所以打算分享一下自己的 618 购物车，另外一方面大家有更好更合适的选择欢迎推荐
1 、电视
电视的选择经过了很多遍，我的需求就是大+不贵+质量好，从一开始的小米（担心质量不行）到索尼（ 75 寸的下架了而且太贵）最终锁定了东芝的这一款，618 的确比平时便宜啊

2 、净水器
这个直饮水一开始就选的史密斯，很早就关注了，平时价格 3k 左右，618 降了点，但是不多。

3 、扫地机器人
那种带水箱的太对了，综合了一下我觉得科沃斯 T9 Power 这一款价格和功能都还不错，打算入手

4 、空调
本来一开始看的格力的，一级能效得 3k 太贵，618 也没怎么优惠，最终打算买 TCL 的这一款</span>

                              <span>在新安装 Fedora后，安装多媒体编码器来播放音频和视频是第一件要事。


在这篇简单的教程中，我们将看到如何在 Fedora 36 工作站中从 RPM Fusion 软件包存储库安装多媒体编码器。

介绍

很多多媒体编码器要么是闭源的，要么是非自由的，因此出于法律的原因，它们没有包含在 Fedora Linux 的默认存储库中。

幸运的是，一些第三方存储库提供了受限的和非自由的多媒体编码器、软件包和库。一个流行的社区驱动的第三方存储库是 RPM Fusion。

如果你想在你的 Fedora 桌面环境中播放大多数的音频或视频格式的文件，你应该从 RPM Fusion 中安装必要的多媒体编码器，如下所述。

在 Fedora Linux 中安装多媒体编码器

确保你已经在你的 Fedora 机器中安装了 RPM Fusion 存储库。如果你尚未添加它，参考下面的链接来在 Fedora 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库：


如何在 Fedora、RHEL 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库


在启用 RPM Fusion 存储库后，在你的 Fedora 系统中依次运行下面的命令来安装多媒体编码器：

$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-\*,good-\*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude&#x3D;gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel


如果上面的命令不工作，尝试下面的命令：

$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-*,good-*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude&#x3D;gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel


$ sudo dnf install lame* --exclude&#x3D;lame-devel


$ sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia


这三个命令安装了非常多的东西，可以在你的 Fedora 系统中播放所有的音频和视频格式的文件。

安装多媒体播放器

一些流行的媒体播放器，诸如 VLC、Celluloid、SMplayer 和 Plex-media-palyer 等等，将提供所有需要的编码器。你不需要将它们全部都安装，只要任意一两个就足够了。下面给出安装这些播放器的命令：

$ sudo dnf install vlc


VLC 预装在很多 Linux 发行版中，它是一个标准的用于播放各种媒体类型文件的媒体播放器。

SMplayer 是 Mplayer 的前端，它被认为是 VLC 的最佳替代品。

$ sudo dnf install smplayer


如果你想要更强大是多媒体体验，安装 Plex-media-player。

$ sudo dnf install plex-media-player


这将不仅为你提供 H264、H265、VP8 和 VP9 编码器（均带硬件支持），它也将启用一种更高效的编码器 AV1（又名 AV01）。你可以使用 AV1 Beta Launch Playlist 来测试你的浏览器是否支持这个编码器。

它们中的一些播放器也可以作为 flatpak 格式的应用程序来使用。如果与传统的软件包管理器相比，你更喜欢 flatpak 格式的应用程序，你可以安装它们。现在大多数的 Linux 发行版都支持开箱即用的 flatpak 格式的应用程序

为安装 VLC 的 flatpak 版本，运行：

$ flatpak install vlc


可选 - 安装 FFmpeg

FFmpeg 是一个功能强大的多媒体框架，它可用于编码、解码、转码、混流、解混流、录制、音轨、过滤等，以及播放各种类型的媒体文件。你可以通过在你的系统上安装 FFmpeg 来获取相应的解码器。


如何在 Linux 中安装 FFmpeg


希望这有帮助。

                              <span>5 月 17 日，谷歌推出了一项新计划，该计划向谷歌云用户策划并提供经过安全审查的开源包选项，以保护开源软件供应链。该公司在一篇 博文 中宣布了这项名为 “安心开源软件Assured Open Source Software” 的新服务。在博文中，谷歌云安全和隐私部门产品经理 Andy Chang 强调了保障开源软件的一些问题，并强调了谷歌对开源的承诺。

“开发者社区、企业及政府对软件供应链风险的意识越来越强，”Chang 写道，并以去年的 log4j 重大漏洞为例。“谷歌仍是开源代码最大的维护者、贡献者和使用者之一，并深入参与了帮助开源软件生态系统更加安全的工作。”

据谷歌称，“安心开源软件”服务将让云客户能够访问谷歌的大量软件审计知识。另据其称，所有通过该服务提供的开源软件包也在公司内部使用，该公司会定期检查和分析其漏洞。

谷歌目前正在审核的 550 个重要开源库的清单可以在 GitHub 上找到。虽然这些库都可以独立于谷歌下载，但该计划将呈现通过谷歌云提供的审核版本，防止开发者破坏广泛使用的开放源码库。这项服务现在处于预先体验阶段，将在 2022 年第三季度准备好进行更广泛的消费者测试。

谷歌的声明只是广大行业努力加强开源软件供应链的安全的一部分，这份努力得到了拜登政府的支持。今年 1 月，美国国土安全部和美国网络安全与基础设施安全局的代表与美国一些主要 IT 公司的高管会面，研究 log4j 漏洞之后的开源软件安全问题。此后，有关公司在最近的一次峰会上承诺提供超过 3000 万美元的资金，以改善开源软件的安全问题。

除了现金，谷歌还在投入工程时间来确保供应链的安全。该公司已宣布发展一个“开源维护小组Open Source Maintenance Crew”，该团队将与库维护人员合作以提高安全性。

                              <span>最新的 Linux 内核 5.18 版本现已如期发布，本次更新包括针对新硬件的支持以及许多其他核心变化。




Linux 5.17 内核 发布时包含了对下一代硬件的支持，同时增强了 Steam Deck 的游戏体验。

每一代内核都包含了令人兴奋的技术进步，Linux 内核 5.18 也不例外。

Linux 内核 5.18 有哪些变化呢？

本次我们可以看到，内核针对雷蛇外设硬件、苹果妙控键盘和 AMD 显卡增强了支持，还有一些网络、核心和安全方面的更新。

新的雷蛇驱动

说到游戏装备，Linux 的硬件支持亟待更新。

目前存在一些开源驱动程序的变通解决方案。但是这些方案不具有普适性，适配和支持较少。

正如 Phoronix 所发现的，Linux 内核 5.18 中一同发布了一个新的雷蛇 HID 驱动程序，它适配了雷蛇黑寡妇蜘蛛键盘，并修复了宏键此前存在的问题。

此外，这个驱动程序应该也有助于解决其他雷蛇硬件的问题。

AMD 显卡特性 FreeSync 模式被默认开启



虽然对 FreeSync 视频的支持足够好，但这只是改善 FreeSync 显示器用户体验的一个临时解决方案。

现在在 Linux 内核 5.18 版本中这一显示模式已被默认启用，用户无需调整任何设置即可使用 FreeSync（见更新日志）。

显卡驱动更新

针对当前和未来的 AMD 显卡的驱动进行了改进。此外，支持英特尔 Arch 图形处理器和英特尔 Alder Lake N 的工作也取得了一些进展。

更高刷新率的 DisplayPort 也在这一个版本中得到支持。

从 C89 标准升级到 C11 标准（GNU11）



在 Linux 内核中使用的是 C89 C 语言标准，在当前已经稍显老旧并且缺失了许多十分必要的新特性。

考虑到目前的编译器版本 GCC 5.1 的要求，从 Linux 内核 5.18 开始决定用 C11 标准来取代它。

网络优化

Linux 内核 5.18 增加了对新的无线硬件的支持，这包括联发科 MT7916、MT7921U 和博通 BCM43454/6。



针对移动设备的改进也包括对英特尔 M.2 WWAN 卡的支持。

Realtek W89 驱动现在支持 AP 模式、6GHz 频段并增加了硬件扫描功能。

在配置 IPv6 和其他各种协议方面，通过一系列的改进提升了性能。

你可以在 Linux 内核 5.18 中网络方面的变更提交中了解所有情况（包括对驱动 API、协议和一些核心功能的改进）。

USB 改进

Xen USB 驱动程序进行了改进，以抵御恶意主设备，USB DWC3 驱动程序也支持了更多的硬件类型。

其他改进详见 更新日志。

增强对苹果键盘以及平板的支持



当前版本针对苹果妙控键盘（包含第一代型号）的使用体验进行了优化。

改进了功能键映射、键盘背光事件，以及 2021 款的妙控键盘通过 USB 连接时报告电池水平的能力。

Linux 内核 5.18 改进了输入处理，在平板电脑上输入将变得更为容易。

硬件相关的改进详见 更新日志。

ARM 架构芯片的支持（特斯拉 FSD，树莓派 Zero 2 W）



Linux 内核 5.18 现在支持特斯拉的全套自动驾驶 SoC。三星工程师将其贡献到了 Linux 内核上游。

其他芯片支持包括高通骁龙 625/632，以及三星 Exynos 850/7885。

你还会发现 Linux 内核 5.18 支持了树莓派 Zero 2 W，而同时去除了旧的硬件/主板的支持。详见 更新日志。

你可以参考 官方更新日志 和 Linus Torvald 的官方公告获取更多信息。

如何安装 Linux 内核 5.18？

你可以在 Linux Kernel Archives 网站上找到最新版本的内核。你可以下载 Tarball 以进行测试。你也可以参照我们的 Linux 内核升级指南 获取帮助。

如果不想自己编译它，你可以稍等几周，等 Linux 发行版们把它推到仓库。

Google has announced that it’s adding the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to cut, copy, and paste files in Drive, as long as you’re using Chrome. The feature will use th— okay, hold on just a minute here. Are you really trying to tell me that we couldn’t already do this?
Sure enough, when I went to Google Drive on the web and pressed Command + C on a file, then went into a folder and pressed Command + V, nothing happened. And this December 2021 archive of Drive’s list of keyboard shortcuts doesn’t say anything about the functions. Which is fine, really — it’s not like keyboard shortcuts for copy, cut, and paste have been around since the functions’ invention in the 1970s.
The feature’s rolling out now, though, and Google’s post says...

Though Jodie Foster has built a name for herself leading thrillers on the silver screen, her next big project’s going to be something a bit different. Deadline reports that Foster has signed on to True Detective’s fourth season to portray Liz Danvers, a detective tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearances of six people from a research station in Ennis, Alaska. While Danvers is up for the task of figuring out where went wrong near the Tsalal Arctic Research Station, she and her partner arrive in Ennis just as the region’s long winter night and its all-encompassing darkness begin to set in.
In addition to starring as Danvers, Foster will also executive produce this chapter of True Detective alongside Barry Jenkins, and the...

Sony is continuing to go all in on turning its flagship video games into TV shows and movies — according to Variety, the company announced that it’s making a show based on Horizon Zero Dawn with Netflix at an event for investors. Sony is also working on a movie based on the Gran Turismo series, according to Deadline, but hasn’t found a distributor for it yet, and could feature Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie) as its director. (I’m very curious as to what the plan for this series is — Variety just says it’ll be about “racing.”)
Both projects are reported to be in “early development,” so we likely won’t be streaming them for quite a while. However, the fact that Sony’s continuing to introduce new TV and movie projects shows that the...

OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, has redesigned its profile and collections pages with the goal of making the site easier to navigate and making the actual NFTs themselves the center of attention. In an announcement post on Thursday, the company says these redesigns are “just the start” of the company’s work to refine how its site works.
In my opinion, OpenSea’s refreshed profile pages look a bit like Twitter and Etsy’s. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. The old version could be a bit tricky to navigate at times, and it seems like the marketplace has smoothed out some of the edges.
The newly-designed Profile and Collection pages make it easier than ever to navigate OpenSea. 
Our goal is to make it easier to...

工匠用冲模一次裁切出12块缎面，它们是用来制作4双鞋的面料。为了保护柔弱的脚趾不受摩擦，还特意用一块棉布作为里衬。接着将它们堆叠起来缝制在一起做成鞋面。

                              <span>前言
众所周知，Flutter 的 WebView 不太友好，用起来不顺手。
我们 Flutter 开发常用的 WebView 库有2个，一个是 Flutter 官方自己出的 webview_flutter ，另一个是比较流行的 flutter_inappwebview 。这两个库其实差不多，flutter_inappwebview 功能比较丰富，封装了很多事件、方法等，但是很多问题这两个库都会遇到。本文以 webview_flutter 为基础库展开讲解相关问题以及解决方案。
问题
白屏、UI错乱
如上图所示
测试的时候发现部分手机（如OPPO）会出现白屏现象
原生与 Flutter 混编，打开页面会发现页面布局变了，顶部banner变小了
查阅网上的一些解决方案，千篇一律都是：
if (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform &#x3D; SurfaceAndroidWebView();

但是，这样设置其实是不对的，还会出现以上问题，真正的解决方案是：
if (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform &#x3D; AndroidWebView();

视频自动播放
由于需求需要，打开页面的时候，列表的第一个视频（YouTube/Facebook 视频）需要自动播放。
但是发现没法自动播放，如下图，会出现播放之后马上暂停的现象。
查阅资料得知，是谷歌浏览器的隐私政策导致的。
Chrome 的自动播放策略

始终允许静音自动播放。
在以下情况下允许自动播放声音：

用户与域进行了交互（单击、点击等）
在桌面上，用户的媒体参与指数阈值已被超过，这意味着用户之前播放过有声视频。
用户已将网站添加到移动设备的主屏幕或在桌面设备上安装 PWA。
顶级框架可以将自动播放权限委托给其 iframe 以允许自动播放声音。
所以要想视频自动播放，有两种方案：
静音播放。

在 Web 端调用视频播放器的静音即可自动播放。
模拟点击。

给 WebView 设置一个 GlobalKey 。
WebView(
    key: logic.state.videoGlobalKey,
    ......
  );
}

然后在 WebView 的 onPageFinished 方法里，通过 GlobalKey 获取 WebView 的位置，从而进行模拟点击，就可以自动播放视频了。
var currentContext &#x3D; state.videoGlobalKey.currentContext;
var offset &#x3D; (currentContext?.findRenderObject() as RenderBox)
    .localToGlobal(Offset.zero);
//模拟点击
var addPointer &#x3D; PointerAddedEvent(
  pointer: 0,
  position: Offset(
      offset.dx + 92.w,
      offset.dy + 92.w),
);
var downPointer &#x3D; PointerDownEvent(
  pointer: 0,
  position: Offset(
      offset.dx + 92.w,
      offset.dy + 92.w),
);
var upPointer &#x3D; PointerUpEvent(
  pointer: 0,
  position: Offset(
      offset.dx + 92.w,
      offset.dy + 92.w),
);
GestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(addPointer);
GestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(downPointer);
GestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(upPointer);

这两种方案各有利弊，方案一无法播放声音（需要用户手动点击开启声音），方案二偶尔会有误触的操作。我们 APP 通过与产品商量最终选取的是方案一的解决方案。
另外 iOS 端自动播放会自动全屏，需要设置以下属性：
WebView(
    key: logic.state.videoGlobalKey,
    // 允许在线播放（解决iOS播放视频自动全屏）
    allowsInlineMediaPlayback: true,
    ......
  );
}

前言
最近使用MPFlutter框架将公司官网做成了一个小程序特爱Lite并发布上线。
首先感谢作者 PonyCui 开源这个框架,让Flutter有更多的可能,仅以此文介绍下MPFlutter框架及开发总结。
官方文档 github
效果先行
自己看着做的，UI略丑轻喷。😂




























MPFlutter简介
官网介绍

MPFlutter 是一个跨平台 Flutter 开发框架，可用于各种小程序、H5、原生应用开发。
开发者可以通过 Dart 语言开发 App，一套代码同时运行在以下平台。
微信小程序
百度小程序
字节小程序、飞书小程序
Web (HTML5)
MPFlutter 提供了丰富的组件、接口，开发者可以轻松地为应用添加平台扩展。
以上摘自MPFlutter官网简介,详细请查看官方文档
鄙人拙见
以下是鄙人拙见,如有错误欢迎指正。
MPFlutter是阉割版的Flutter：裁剪非必须渲染层打包成Web并通过 kbone框架在小程序上运行的Flutter变种框架。
实际上是让将Futter Web项目运行在小程序上,借用kbone在小程序下搭建一个可运行web的模拟环境
Tencent kbone Github
那么MPFlutter的缺陷也就很明显了
不少Flutter Widget不支持 核心Widget
很多Flutter三方库不能直接使用如果三方库引入了MPFlutter不支持的Widget则无法使用支持的三方库;dart packages是可以直接使用的。如工具类common_utils、日志打印logger等。
不少基础组件都需自行实现如TextButton、TextFieldForm 针对小程序及Web的组件库MPKit
而MPFlutter优点也是很明显的。

以前台下客，如今台上人，曾惊鸿一瞥，今再会旅程。
2022年5月末，经过一个多月的面试，我的 GDE (Google Developer Expert) 终于正式成功通过面试，成为了国内第 4 位 Flutter &amp; Dart GDE。

由于时间原因，目前在官方的 experts/directory 可能还没同步，预计要一两个星期。
成为 GDE 有什么好处
相信对于 Android 或者 Machine Learning  的开发者来说 GDE 应该是一个很熟悉的头衔，GDE  是 Google 在全球范围内开展的一个开发者专家认证项目，成为 GDE 除了是对你的技术和影响力认可之外，你还可以获得：
提前获悉谷歌内部产品路线或者技术变更的相关信息；
直接和 Google 产品团队沟通技术问题，获得一些 Google 内测资格；
谷歌活动邀请，如 I/O 大会并报销差旅；
JetBrains 会为所有 GDE 提供免费的 JetBrains 全家桶；
截止到目前为止，全球 GDE 大概有 980+ ，其中 Flutter  相关人数接近 90 人，所以如果你对 GDE 有兴趣，看完本篇，相信你也可以加入 GDE 的大家庭。
申请 GDE 的起因
不知道有多少 Android 开发还记得 ApkBus，2013 年我刚开始入坑 Android 那会， 安卓巴士可以说是我的启蒙社区，就连我建立至今 6 年的 Android 公交群也是在致敬 ApkBus 。
而在最后一届 ApkBus 的 《无界》 大会上，我接触到了人生中的第一位 GDE ，虽然那时候还只是台下众多看客中的一人，但是也是从那时候开始，我在不知不觉中也走上了“登台”之路。

在那届大会上我认识了很多 Android 开发的朋友，也结识了一些社区的运营人员，这也给了我后面“登台…</span>

【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 贰】操纵杆与角色移动 (本文)
1. Flame 官方案例
在 github 仓库中 flame/examples 中是官方的案例，对于入门而言是很有参考意义的。 但它也不是非常惊艳，作为一个游戏引擎的官方案例来说，还是太过简陋。

其中介绍了很多基本模块，每个模块中的案例都能很方便地找到对应的源码，这一点还是很值得肯定的。

本文我们将基于如下的 Joystick 案例，介绍一下操纵杆的使用，以及角色的移动。移动是最基础的游戏交互，还是先介绍为好。

本文的效果如下，通过左下角的操纵杆，来移动角色：本文源码于 【lib/02】

2. 操纵杆的使用
操纵杆的原理非常简单，如下以大圆中心为原点建立坐标系，正方向分别向 右 和 下 。通过小圆心的坐标就可以确定偏移量以及旋转角度。这里主要使用偏移量来修改角色的 position 位置。

同样，操纵杆本身也是 Component 构建。如下，在 TolyGame 的 onLoad中构造 JoystickComponent 对象，通过 add 方法加入到游戏中。主要这里的 TolyGame 需要混入 HasDraggables ，才能支持操纵杆拖拽。

背景
首先看到标题，相信大家已经血压飙升了，既然都用了Flutter，怎么还用原生的网络库呢？这不是多此一举么。emmmmm，当我看到这个需求的时候一样恼火。但因为我们项目中使用的Dio库不支持查询DNS、SSL等所需时间（至少我没找到），而Okhttp却可以。因此，不得以只能借助原生网络库去实现此功能。
实现方案
既然必须要去实现，那摆在面前的问题就是如何去实现了。最简单粗暴的一个方式，就是通过建立一个Flutter Channel将网络请求的所有信息传到原生，但脑补一波后，发现实现起来太过麻烦，一堆header,body,data等信息都需要自己组装，并且致命的是需要改动现有项目的请求方式。因此为了避免项目大改，最后看中了Dio提供的interceptors（拦截器）功能，在拦截器中，我们可以对网络请求进行拦截，拦截后再通过FlutterChannel发给原生进行网络请求。这样既避免了项目改动，也省去了数据组装，很容易的达到了目标。
实现步骤
首先定义一个拦截器（NativeNetInterceptor），用来转发网络请求，在onRequest中，我们调用了NativeNet.sendRequestToNative方法，用来接收接口中的参数（url、header、body、data、等等等），方便下一步转发。catch模块主要用来捕获异常，如果是DioError，直接reject，如果是其他异常，可以调用handler.next(options)继续走Dio请求，当作兜底方案。这里我注释掉了。

  final Dio dio;

@潘誉晗：杨本芬「看见女性」三重奏《秋园》《浮木》《我本芬芳》

在历史的过往中看见女性。
——荐杨本芬「看见女性」三重奏

《秋园》《浮木》和《我本芬芳》是杨本芬老奶奶所写的「看见女性」三重奏，由良心出版社「乐府文化」出品。在 2020 年的时候，这本素人作者的书一经推出之后，不仅迅速登上了各大排行榜，也拯救了「乐府文化」这一品牌。之后，杨奶奶又写了《浮木》和《我本芬芳》。在这三本系列的故事中，杨本芬老奶奶回忆了母亲浮木般挣扎的一生，写了乡间那些人的生生死死，还写了自己看似固若金汤可其实没能获得真正幸福的婚姻。

三本连着一起读的过程很爽，也对于杨奶奶的家族和人生有着更进一步地了解，可也正是因此，读完之后甚至是整个阅读的过程，我的心情都非常沉重。即使是那样小小的三本册子，可我依然可以在三十万的文字中，感受到上个世纪年纪，普通女性在大时代背景下的那种挣扎。在《秋园》中，我们可以看到杨奶奶的母亲秋园，少年失父，中年失子、失夫，为了让孩子们活下去，改嫁之后的她到异地生活了二十年；在《浮木》中，除了杨奶奶的一家人，我们也能够看到那个时代的人的更多面，或无奈自由选择婚姻，亦或者身世浮沉，无论哪一种，最后都在时代的巨轮中被淹没；而在《我本芬芳》中，杨奶奶把笔触伸向了自己六十年的婚姻，那是一段看了更让人心疼的真实，为了不下放，为了可以继续学习，和只认识两个月的陌生人结婚，可婚前的种种示好在婚后都变成了不体谅的冷漠，当她的婚姻走过六十年的钻石婚，留下的也只是对方冷冰冰的…</span>

                              <span>我在Steam里游戏时间最长的三个分别是：了不起的修真模拟器、鬼谷八荒、觅长生。我看的网文类型中修真题材也有很高的占比，例如飘渺之旅、修真世界、诛仙、修真门派掌门路、仙剑神曲。不仅仅是中文圈子里，国外很多毫无中文文化背景的人也在追粗浅翻译的修真网文，或是玩修真游戏，并为之着迷。当然对于专有名词的翻译也苦了这些游戏制作组们了。
也不仅仅是游戏和网文，现在更多的文化作品例如影视剧、漫画、电影等也开始了修真题材的创作，甚至有爆款的产品出圈。即使不接触这些题材的文艺作品，修真世界内的很多设定也在现实中有了广泛的影响力，有些做到了广为人知，甚至形成了影响力不小的亚文化，像是飞剑、丹符等。
结合我自己的感受和观察到的种种现象，让我不禁有些惊讶于修真这个题材的原始吸引力。这让我在阅读或游玩的时候开始留意起了种种元素或设定，试图寻找让人着迷的原因。之前看过新垣平博士的《剑桥倚天屠龙史》，看着一本正经的分析“小龙女身世考”和“论光明顶战争的意义”，不禁让人在恍惚之余，也惊讶与修真世界类似的武侠世界有着如此丰富的累积，甚至可以让人凭借小说情节写史。
通过对比、寻找和分析，目前我找到了几个可能的答案。
极其完善自洽的世界设定
修真大陆的世界观
修真这个题材首先给人最直观的感受就是世界观和设定的完善，一个好的框架加上不断的内容填充，发展到现在，很多创作者可以无需增减直接拿来用。便捷的创作条件就会有利于新作品的诞生，进而继续拓展修真的世界观。
简单介绍一下我能想到的设定，因为想要详细展开再加考证的话一本书的厚度都够呛。
修真世界的大陆应该是使用了古代神话故事里的原型，根据剧情进行微调，但大多数会有不同环境的陆地和海外岛屿组成。根据天地灵气的程度，区分为不同的世界等级，例如人界、仙界、神界、冥界之类，修士修炼之后可以不断的往上突破，术语叫飞升。人界就是我们生活的世界，大陆上会有不同的种族，例如人类、妖…</span>

                              <span>前一阵，12代处理器的弯曲问题被推上了风口浪尖。毕竟LGA1700的处理器变成了长方形，纵向弯矩增大，抗弯能力自然也是变弱了。而且由于扣具的设计问题，处理器有极大的弯曲风险。当然现在还是有针对性的解决办法：

原装扣具安装垫片
选用第三方扣具

具体影响多大、效果如何，还是得通过实际测试看看。

对于处理器温度影响最大的两个因素，一个是散热器自身的散热能力，另外一个是机箱的整体风道情况。为了体现更换扣具前后的差异，直接插满内存摘了显卡，保证完全是处理器单拷的状态进行相关测试。

Intel 12400规格为10nm制程，6核12线，设计TDP 65W，18MB L3 Cache。默频2.5GHz，单核睿频4.4GHz，全核睿频3.8GHz。其Fritz Chess Benchmark多线程成绩为54.42倍P3，26121千步每秒；CineBench R20成绩为4784pts。

作为一款入门级的四热管散热器，冰立方400性价比真的太高了，另外一个四百知道吧，这个完全是全面升级款，而且拆装还不割手。一百出头的价格能与压220W的热功耗，除了那些旗舰级的大火炉外，各款中端处理器压起来毫不费力。而且作为新一代的散热器，更换新款扣具后，借助2mm的金属背板和转接架，能够完美兼容消费级平台同时，安装更为简单和牢固。

当然，全新散热器最重要的就是自带的硅脂，布得看着越整齐自然产品级别越高。同样也能看到，中心的两根热管是贴在一起的，更靠近CPU核心顶部的位置，能够更好地解决低纳米制程处理器积热问题。

矩阵式散热器片采用冲压工艺，配上扣合Fin+折边Fin工艺， 在保留了相应散热能力的同时，把塔体做到了宽45mm高155mm这种兼容性极佳的小尺寸。哪怕内存的马甲再高，也完全不会产…</span>

在这个信息过载的时代，我既是一名知识汲取的受益者，同时也是知识反噬的焦虑者。作为一名信息安全从业者，需要具有大量的阅读和碎片知识的积累，来帮助自己完善知识体系、提升对安全认知的见解。在这个成长的过程中，同时也会伴随着反噬、焦虑，比如自己的精力和意志时常产生矛盾互相打架，收藏的paper、想做的 ideas 积压的越来越多，生活和技术分配的时间失去了平衡等等，导致陷入在信息洪流和知识焦虑中难以自拔。
之前有一段时间，我大部分信息来源渠道，甚至娱乐相关的APP几乎都被技术相关话题所淹没，我被自己困在了自己勾勒的信息茧房中，抛开技术仿佛就是一只小白懵懵糟糟，唯一换来的可能就是朋友的调侃只要发给我的paper，好像都被我提前看过了，而得到的那一丝丝“奇怪的自豪感”。
无休止的奔跑、野蛮的阅读、仅靠意志力和信息洪流正面刚，诚然量变会产生质变能够带来不少帮助，并且这种“野蛮”、“痛”的过程我一直也认为是很有必要的，只是在经历过后，需要能够把自己拽出来，进而更好更有效率的学习沉淀。当下不敢说摆脱了知识焦虑的困扰，自己偶尔也还是会出现焦虑，“禁闭”个一两天和自己作对下，但相比之前好了很多，同时在这个过程中也有了一些自己的感悟，拿出来和大家一起交流，共同捍卫我们的信息流。
0x02 为无休止的奔跑，按下暂停键
无休止的奔跑，会让信息积压的更多，既给自己增添焦虑感，也不利于内容吸收。因此需要阶段性的按下暂停键，回顾整理沉淀，降低知识的焦虑感。如何降低知识焦虑感？我有如下这几个小 tips 和大家分享：
1、减少Inbox收集入口，不再随意使用收藏功能
之前零碎信息管理上有个明显的问题，就是入口过多，多个信息渠道收藏、转发，甚至有时候图一时方便直接截图或粘贴备忘录，导致回顾整理起来非常耗费精力。因此开始缩减入口，减少在不同渠道平台上使用收藏功能，把过滤后的信息入口，统一都放入在 …</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。 
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

2020 年，根据对欧洲、亚洲、北美和南美 29 个国家和地区的 8709 名消费者的调查，语言服务咨询机构 CSA Research 发现，76% 的人在网购时更喜欢购买用自己母语标示了信息的产品，40% 的人永远不会从非母语网站上买东西。因此，CSA 给这份报告起的标题是《B2C：看不懂就不买》。
这再次印证了语言支持对于提升用户体验、促进用户增长的重要性。CSA 认为，本地语言支持可以打造更具粘性的消费者关系，而且更强大的全球化品牌，也会极大地影响购买决策。
这也是为什么专注于产品全球化咨询的独立商业咨询师 John Yunker，会十几年如一日地收集汇总和分析全球品牌网站的语言支持情况。他把网站或应用（主要是网站）上的语言选单——引导用户进入本地化版本网站的登陆页面和页首菜单称为「全球入口」（global gateway），当用户打开一个非自己母语的网页时，首先会寻找这个入口，把语言切换到自己的母语。
但在设计语言选单的时候，不同的公司/网站采取的策略各不相同，设计网站 SmashingMagazine.com 的主编、UX 设计师、前端开发者 Vitaly Friedman 就撰写了 一篇非常详尽的文章，梳理分析了现有网站实现语言选单时的各种做法，最后总结出了非常具有实操价值的语言选单设计原则。

When trying to familiarize yourself with someone else&#x27;s project, you usually appreciate the comments left behind that help you understand the meaning of their code. In the same way, whenever you are programming, whether for yourself or for others, it is good practice to comment your own code. All programming languages offer a special syntax to mark a word, a line, or a whole section as a comment. Those areas are then ignored by the compiler or interpreter when the source code is processed. 
Comments don&#x27;t take the place of documentation, but there is a way to use your comments to produce documentation easily. Meet Doxygen, an open source tool for generatin…</span>

Vely is a tool for writing web and command-line applications in C. Vely combines high performance and the low footprint associated with C programming with ease of use and improved safety reminiscent of languages like PHP. It&#x27;s free and open source software, and licensed under GPLv3 and LGPL 3 for libraries, so you can even build commercial software with it.
Vely works on major Linux distributions and processor architectures. You can use webservers, such as Apache, Nginx, or others, and databases such as MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
You can use Vely for web applications, command-line programs, as middleware, database applications, services software, data integr…</span>

                              <span>兆芯再次将其“陆家嘴” CPU 的支持推到 GCC

兆芯早在 2019 年就推出了代号为 “陆家嘴” 的 16 纳米 x86 CPU，可以用于笔记本电脑、服务器等设备。“陆家嘴” CPU 的运行频率可达 3GHz，支持 DDR4-3200 内存，可处理高达 64GB 的内存。本周，GCC 编译器对 “陆家嘴” 的支持再次被送出，因为他们之前的上游尝试由于在周期中较晚而没有进入 GCC 12。

老王点评：中国的 CPU 要想得到更多支持，积极向上游提交代码才行，兆芯在最近几个月才开始尝试在 GCC 中对“陆家嘴”进行上游检测和支持。




AI 正在打破专利法

过去几年，越来越多的发明涉及到了 AI。AI 帮助设计药物，开发疫苗，发现新材料。它的广泛使用对现有的专利制度构成了挑战。因为旧的专利法假设发明者是人类。如果法院和政府决定 AI 创造的发明不能授予专利，无疑这将会产生巨大影响，将会降低利用 AI 进行研究和发明的积极性。有研究人员提出设计新的 AI 专利法律 AI-IP 去保护 AI 的发明。

老王点评：你看，随着 AI 能拥有专利，以后具有 AI 的机器人也会逐渐得到更多的法律地位。




科学家们正在建立量子互联网

中国和美国等国家已经在量子计算机方面取得了一些进展，但如果没有“量子互联网”，量子计算将无法发挥其潜力。量子互联网是可以在遥远的机器之间发送量子信息的计算机网络。量子传送可以在不同地点之间传递信息，而不需要实际移动容纳信息的物理物质，而且这种方式无法拦截。之前，科学家只能做到在两个地点传送量子，而现在荷兰代尔夫特理工大学的研究人员做到了在三个地点间传送，他们的目标是最终建立一个量子互联网。

老王点评：量子技术就这样一步步进步，我现在已经完全无法想象量子计算能将这个世界变成什么样子了。

                              <span>在 Fedora 中重置忘记的 root 密码。




你是否忘记了 Fedora 中的 root 密码？或者你想更改 Fedora 系统中的 root 用户密码？没问题！本手册将指导你在 Fedora 操作系统中完成更改或重置 root 密码的步骤。

注意： 本手册已在 Fedora 36 和 35 版本上进行了正式测试。下面提供的步骤与在 Fedora Silverblue 和旧 Fedora 版本中重置 root 密码的步骤相同。

步骤 1 - 打开 Fedora 系统并按下 ESC 键，直到看到 GRUB 启动菜单。出现 GRUB 菜单后，选择要引导的内核并按下 e 编辑选定的引导条目。



步骤 2 - 在下一个页面中，你将看到所有启动参数。找到名为 ro 的参数。



步骤 3 - 将 ro 参数替换为 rw init&#x3D;/sysroot/bin/sh。请注意 rw 和 init&#x3D;/sysroot...之间的空格。修改后的内核参数行应如下所示。



步骤 4 - 上述步骤更改参数后，按 Ctrl+x 进入紧急模式，即单用户模式。

在紧急模式下，输入以下命令以 读/写 模式挂载根文件系统（/）。

chroot /sysroot/




步骤 5 - 现在使用 passwd 命令重置 root 密码：

passwd root


输入两次 root 密码。我建议使用强密码。



步骤 6 - 重置 root 密码后，运行以下命令在重启时启用 SELinux 重新标记：

touch /.autorelabel




步骤 7 - 最后，退出单用户模式并通过运行以下命令将 Fedora 系统重启到正常模式：

exit


reboot


等待 SELinux 重新标记完成。这将需要几分钟，具体时长取决于文件系统的大小和硬盘的速度。



步骤 8 - 文件系统重新标记完成后，你可以使用新的 root 密码登录到你的 Fedora 系统。



如你所见，在 Fedora 36 中重置 root 密码的步骤非常简单，并且与 在 RHEL 中重置 root 密码 及其衍生版本（如 CentOS、AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux）完全相同。

Compose 在动画方面下足了功夫，提供了种类丰富的 API。但也正由于 API 种类繁多，如果想一气儿学下来，可能会消化不良导致似懂非懂。结合例子学习是一个不错的方法，本文就带大家边学边做，通过高仿微博长按点赞的彩虹动画，学习和实践 Compose 动画的相关技巧。

1. Compose 动画 API 概览
Compose 动画 API 在使用场景的维度上大体分为两类：高级别 API 和低级别 API。就像编程语
言分为高级语言和低级语言一样，这列高级低级指 API 的易用性：
高级别 API 主打开箱即用，适用于一些 UI 元素的展现/退出/切换等常见场景，例如常见的 AnimatedVisibility 以及 AnimatedContent 等，它们被设计成 Composable 组件，可以在声明式布局中与其他组件融为一体。
//Text通过动画淡入
var editable by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
AnimatedVisibility(visible &#x3D; editable) {
    Text(text &#x3D; &quot;Edit&quot;)
}

低级别 API 使用成本更高但是更加灵活，可以更精准地实现 UI 元素个别属性的动画，多个低级别动画还可以组合实现更复杂的动画效果。最常见的低级别 animateFloatAsState 系列了，它们也是 Composable 函数，可以参与 Composition 的组合过程。

一、 新的可能性
Google I/O 2022 对于 Flutter 而言，将 休闲游戏 带入了大众的视野。让 Flutter 除了应用开发之外，有了新的可能性。其中作为游戏开发引擎的 Flame ，也为更多人所知晓。说实话，之前我并不怎么看得上 Flame ，无论是官网还是文档，内容都很少，感觉非常小众。我期待着官方可以出一个游戏引擎，但现在看来，官方也倾向于使用 Flame 引擎来开发休闲的 2D 游戏，那我无需再等，开摆 。
【Flutter&amp;Flame 游戏 - 壹】开启新世界的大门 (本文)
1. 弹球开源弹球游戏 pinball
在 I/O 2022 中， 官方用 Flutter 写的弹球小游戏，确实让我眼前一亮，开源地址在：【pinball】。这说明基本的碰撞、音乐、动画没有什么问题，用来做休闲小游戏是足够的，我也就没什么好担心的了。

所以，接下来将开启一个系列，研究 Flutter&amp;Flame 的游戏 2D 休闲游戏开发。另外，为了录屏、截图方便，这里主要在 macOS 平台上运行，实现桌面版的 Flutter 游戏。

简介
Jetpack Compose 是用于构建原生 Andorid 界面的新工具包，Compose 使用了更少的代码，强大的工具和直观的 Kotlin Api 简化并且加快了 Android 上界面的开发。
在 Compose 中，在构建界面的时候，无需在像之前那么构建 XML 布局，只需要调用 Jetpack Compose 函数来声明你想要的的元素，Compose 编译器就会自动帮你完成后面的工作。
在开始使用 Compose 之前，你需要重新搭建环境，可参考**官方文档**
注解
@Compose
所有的组合函数都必须添加 @Compose 注解才可以。
被 @Compose 注解的方法只能被同类型的方法调用。
@Preview
使用该注解的方法可以不在运行 App 的情况下就可以查看布局。@Preview 中常用的参数如下：
name: String: 为该Preview命名，该名字会在布局预览中显示。
showBackground: Boolean: 是否显示背景，true为显示。
backgroundColor: Long: 设置背景的颜色。
showDecoration: Boolean: 是否显示Statusbar和Toolbar，true为显示。
group: String: 为该Preview设置group名字，可以在UI中以group为单位显示。
fontScale: Float: 可以在预览中对字体放大，范围是从0.01。
widthDp: Int: 在Compose中渲染的最大宽度，单位为dp。
heightDp: Int: 在Compose中渲染的最大高度，单位为dp。

Kubernetes Database Operator is useful for building scalable database servers as a database (DB) cluster. But because you have to create new artifacts expressed as YAML files, migrating existing databases to Kubernetes requires a lot of manual effort. This article introduces a new open source tool named Konveyor Tackle-DiVA-DOA (Data-intensive Validity Analyzer-Database Operator Adaptation). It automatically generates deployment-ready artifacts for database operator migration. And it does that through datacentric code analysis.
What is Tackle-DiVA-DOA?

In the age of high-speed internet, most large information systems are structured as distributed systems with components running on different machines. The performance of these systems is generally assessed by their throughput and response time. When performance is poor, debugging these systems is challenging due to the complex interactions between different subcomponents and the possibility of the problem occurring at various places along the communication path.
On the fastest networks, the performance of a distributed system is limited by the host&#x27;s ability to generate, transmit, process, and receive data, which is in turn dependent on its hardware…</span>

DuckDuckGo 的搜索主要是基于微软的必应搜索。最近，研究人员发现 DuckDuckGo 手机浏览器并没有阻止第三方网站上的微软追踪器。DuckDuckGo 解释称，微软不知道用户在 DuckDuckGo 上的搜索，DuckDuckGo 浏览器也屏蔽了所有微软的 cookie，但如果你访问了一个含有微软跟踪程序的网站，那么用户的数据将会暴露给必应搜索引擎和领英。DuckDuckGo 称，根据一份保密的微软搜索合作协议要求，他们为了从必应拉取搜索信息必须如此。

GitHub Copilot 将对学生免费开放

去年 6 月，微软旗下的 GitHub 和 OpenAI 推出了 Copilot，它以一个可下载的扩展提供服务，支持 VSCode、JetBrains 等 IDE，可以根据现有代码的上下文提示代码行和功能。微软表示将在今年夏天全面发布这一工具，并将免费提供给学生和“经过验证的”开源贡献者。微软称在技术预览期间，有数万人经常使用该工具，开发者生成的 Java 和 Python 等语言的代码中，约有 35% 是由 Copilot 提示的。

荷兰警方制作被害男孩的深度伪造视频，希望获得新线索

在一名少年被谋杀近 20 年后，荷兰警方在使用深度伪造技术将其“复活”后收到了几十条线索。2003 年，一位 13 岁的少年在鹿特丹地铁站的停车场扔雪球时被击毙。这件谋杀案让警方困惑了多年。在其家人的允许下，警方制作了一个视频，在视频中，这位少年请求公众帮助解决这起悬案。荷兰警方认为这可能是世界首例，视频中出现了该少年栩栩如生的形象，并请求知情者提供线索。

                              <span>掌握管理本地/远程分支等最常见的 Git 任务。


Git 的主要优势之一就是它能够将工作“分叉”到不同的分支中。

如果只有你一个人在使用某个存储库，分支的好处是有限的。但是，一旦你开始与许多其他贡献者一起工作，分支就变得必不可少。Git 的分支机制允许多人同时处理一个项目，甚至是同一个文件。用户可以引入不同的功能，彼此独立，然后稍后将更改合并回主分支。那些专门为一个目的创建的分支，有时也被称为主题分支topic branch，例如添加新功能或修复已知错误。

当你开始使用分支，了解如何管理它们会很有帮助。以下是开发者在现实世界中使用 Git 分支执行的最常见任务。

重命名分支

有时候，你或许会错误地命名了一个分支，或者你会想要在内容合并到主分支后，使用同一个分支在不同的错误或任务之间切换。在这种情况下，重命名主题分支就会很有帮助。

重命名本地分支

1、重命名本地分支：

$ git branch -m 
 


当然，这只会重命名你的分支副本。如果远程 Git 服务器上存在该分支，请继续执行后续步骤。

2、推送这个新分支，从而创建一个新的远程分支：

$ git push origin 


3、删除旧的远程分支：

$ git push origin -d -f 



重命名当前分支

当你要重命名的分支恰好是当前分支时，你不需要指定旧的分支名称。

1、重命名当前分支：

$ git branch -m 


2、推送新分支，从而创建一个新的远程分支：

$ git push origin 


3、删除…</span>

在传统的 Unix 和类 Unix 系统上，新系统中存在的第一个同时也是唯一的用户是 root。使用 root 账户登录并创建“普通”用户。在初始化之后，你应该以普通用户身份登录。

以普通用户身份使用系统是一种自我施加的限制，可以防止愚蠢的错误。例如，作为普通用户，你不能删除定义网络接口的配置文件或意外覆盖用户和组列表。作为普通用户，你无权访问这些重要文件，所以你无法犯这些错误。作为系统的实际所有者，你始终可以通过 su 命令切换为超级用户（root）并做你想做的任何事情，但对于日常工作，你应该使用普通账户。

几十年来，su 运行良好，但随后出现了 sudo 命令。

对于日常使用超级用户的人来说，sudo 命令乍一看似乎是多余的。在某些方面，它感觉很像 su 命令。例如：

$ su root

# dnf install -y cowsay


sudo 做同样的事情：

$ sudo dnf install -y cowsay



它们的作用几乎完全相同。但是大多数发行版推荐使用 sudo 而不是 su，甚至大多数发行版已经完全取消了 root 账户（LCTT 译注：不是取消，而是默认禁止使用 root 用户进行登录、运行命令等操作。root 依然是 0 号用户，依然拥有大部分系统文件和在后台运行大多数服务）。让 Linux 变得愚蠢是一个阴谋吗？

事实并非如此。sudo 使 Linux 更加灵活和可配置，并且没有损失功能，此外还有 几个显著的优点。

为什么在 Linux 上 sudo 比 root 更好？

以下是你应该使用 sudo 替换 su 的五个原因。

1. root 是被攻击确认的对象

@潘誉晗：《桶川跟踪狂杀人事件》

被谋杀了三次的女大学生。
——《桶川跟踪狂杀人事件》的悲剧

阅读这本被誉为 「记者的教科书」「日本纪实文学的金字塔」的这本书的原因，真的就是因为简介写得实在是太有吸引力：「九九九年十月二十六日，年轻女子猪野诗织在日本埼玉县 JR 桶川站前遭人持刀刺死。受害者生前因长期受到跟踪骚扰而多次向警方报案，警方却未予重视，最终没能阻止悲剧的发生。」确实是一段非常棒的阅读过程，作为一部纪实作品，它深刻，却又写得通俗易懂，让人一看就手不释卷，当然，也正是因为这般的一目了然，所以心底便生出了更多的遗憾和气愤。
因为这本是一场可以被阻止的谋杀。
接受记者调查的时候，猪野诗织朋友所的第一句话就是：「诗织是被小松和警方杀死的。」只是这样寥寥几个字，却已经足够令人震惊。原来这一场悲剧，只要警方有所动作，是真的可以避免的。毕竟早在案件发生之前，嫌疑人小松（猪野诗织的前男友）就因为两个人感情的时候叫嚣着要把诗织杀死，担心受怕的一家人选择了团结一心并且积极录音、报警，可当他们一家人去报警的时候，警方并没有采取任何实质性的举措。即使面对嫌疑人越来越猖狂的威胁，无论他们拿出了多少证据，警方也依然不处理，甚至是上门「要求」他们取消报案。如此忽略、漠视受害者生前报案已经让人不能接受的情况下，警方更是在案后企图抹黑受害者，并利用自身的权利掩盖之前渎职的行为：「县警冷酷的反击，终于到了露骨地攻击诗织的地步。读到这些内容，我忍不住呻吟。县警利用诗织的日记，不仅践…</span>

前言
对于特斯拉而言，充电补能是日常使用最为重要的一部分，好的充电体验能大大增加纯电车使用的幸福感。

我之前关于充电体验的分享中，有不少评论对于随车充比较感兴趣，我个人和身边车主也都有不同随车充产品是使用经历，关于固定充电桩和第三方充电桩可以看我已经发布的分享，本篇来专门聊聊随车充！
我的充电方式
先说说我个人用车，目前接近两万公里，在提车的前半段，我基本是使用第三方快充为主，其中包括合计 3000km，也就是 750 度电的特斯拉官方超充，它们大概为我提供了实际5000km 上下的行车里程。

在我安装自己的家充桩之前，商场内的第三方充电站也是为我车辆续航的主力，也因为商场充电普遍可以免 2 小时停车费，我也经常以充一点点电的方式实现免费停车。

去年申请到了 380V 电表，安装好 21kW 充电桩之后，自己的家充桩可以让我下班停好车，设置好 10 点开始充电后，早上顺利满电出门。它会是未来绝大多数时间我的核心补能手段。

而在去年夏天，住的一套老房子可以把车停在楼下，从三楼窗户接延长线下来，使用普诺得 3.5kW 随车充充电，这一方式我也使用了一个多月，随车充也作为未来外出自驾游、去农家乐的补电方式，常驻在了我的后备箱中，不过大家都知道今年的上海，到现在一直没什么出去玩的机会。
随车充的优势与劣势
优点：

便携式充电器，可以随车携带。
不用申请独立电表，只要带电三孔插座就能实现补能。
低功率交流充电，对电池友好。
可作为固定充电桩使用的随车充，价格普遍低于同功率的固定充电桩。

缺点：

大部分使用环境下，充电速…</span>

                              <span>前言
之前写了一篇《免费的个人博客系统搭建及部署解决方案（Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis）》，讲述了一下我使用 Serverless 和一些开源项目搭建的博客系统，也开了个系列来记录搭建过程。
本篇是关于博客评论系统的解决方案，我最早使用的博客评论系统是万恶的 Disqus，一个笨重且会收集用户隐私的知名评论系统，因为加载比较慢，且免费版本经常会附带一些广告，实在难以忍受，于是换成了另一个基于 GitHub issues 的评论系统 utterances，它会为每篇文章生成一个 issue，将，用户通过授权 GitHub 登录来对 issue 发表评论。这种方式的好处是只需要授权一个 utterances-bot 来进行管理，无需自己部署服务，维护数据库等。但是用了一段时间后，觉得有几点不足：

基于 GitHub API 进行评论管理，如之后接口变动或对这类利用 issue 进行评论的方式进行限制，会不太稳定
读者必须要授权 GitHub 登录，非技术人员或使用移动端阅读的读者使用起来很不方便
会将 GitHub 仓库弄得较乱，也不方便后续迁移到其他系统

经过一番调研 Randy 的 Cusdis 很合我的心意。Cusdis 是一个注重数据隐私的开源的评论系统，十分轻量，经过 gzipped 后大约只有 5kb，从名字来看也知道开发者也是难以忍受 Disqus，自己做了一个替代版，因此它也是支持 Disqus 历史数据导入的，很贴心。
虽然这是一个开发早期的项目，但是已经提供了电子邮件通知以及通过 Webhook 联动 Telegram 等方式进行评论提醒，对使用者来说很方便进行管理。Cusdis 提供了免费托管服务与自行部署两种方式，如果不想折腾可以直接用作者提供的服务。自行部署则需要服务器与一个 Postgre SQL 实例，我们主要示范一…</span>

前言
NDK 全称  Native Development Kit，也就是原生开发工具包 ，官网对它有详细的 中文介绍 。可能一说到 NDK 或 JNI ，大家脑子里第一反应就是集成 C/C++ 。其实 JNI 的含义是 Java Native Interface ，这种接口允许 Java 和其他语言进行交互的，包括但不限于 C/C++ 。目前 Rust 也可以通过 JNI 来和 Java 交互，虽然不太成熟。
其实 NDK 更像一个桥梁，来连通 Java 和其他语言，它是一系列工具的集合。既然作为工具， NDK 并非必须在 Android  项目中才能用。本文我们来通过 NDK 对 FFmpeg 5.0 进行编译，生成动态链接库 so 。

注：本文的 Java 泛指 JVM 语言，不要拿 Kotlin 抬杠，本质太大的区别 。本文测试项目源码地址【TolyFFmpeg】
一、环境准备
想要编译 FFmpeg 应用 Android 中的动态链接库，我们要准备两个东西：一者是 FFmpeg 的源码；二者是 NDK 的工具包。这两者都可以通过简单的下载获得。
1、FFmpeg 源码下载：5.0.1
作为一个开源项目，想得到源码还是非常简单的。可以在官网直接下载源码，也可以通过 git 来下载，或者点击More releases 来选择某个版本进行下载。
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

源码解压如下，里面的 doc 文件夹有些文档和案例，还是比较有用的。其余的东西暂时对我们来说并没有什么太大的意义，现在我们的目的是通过这个源码通过 NDK 来编译成在 Android 中可以使用的动态链接库 so 文件。

我正在参加「初夏创意投稿大赛」详情请看：初夏创意投稿大赛
0x1、引言
对于电商来说，夏天 中最重要的日子莫过于——618大促，看看这类APP的LOGO就知道了~

又是一大波蹲点抢券，各种凑凑凑，签到、关注店铺、加购商品等 价格歧视 策略。
最近某电商刚开展618分19亿的活动，依旧是那些 简单无聊但费阳寿的任务，不薅白不薅，问了群里的小伙伴，貌似还没有脚本：

看了下任务，跟之前打年兽的玩法，不能说是一模一样，可以说是完全一致，不知道读者还记得这篇文章不：《节约&quot;阳寿&quot;——某电商春节炸年兽自动化》，稍微改了一下当时的脚本 (点击区域调整、匹配图片替换)，再次成功解放双手~

不过，虽然能用，但还不够好，小结那里也列出问题了：

其中最大的问题还是，任务判定用了第三方的OCR API，白嫖有次数限制，脚本做不了几天就歇菜了，索性用新的思路重新写一个吧~

0x2、从OCR文本匹配判定 → 图片相似度判定
之前判定执行什么任务的流程：
判断Airtest匹配到的 &quot;去完成&quot; 图标对应的哪个任务描述；
生成屏幕截图，裁剪此任务描述区域；
调用百度OCR提取文本，遍历Task匹配词；
命中Task，点击去完成按钮，并执行后续操作；


简单粗暴，就是每个任务都要消耗一次识别，很快就会达到每个月的白嫖上限。而实际上，任务描述区域这块：

是 固定不变的，完全可以这样做：
定好五个截图的坐标区域；
生成屏幕截图后，裁剪出这五个区域，然后划分判定；
任务判定时，拿要判定的任务区域的截图，进行相似度对比；
大于一个特定值，如0.9，说明是某类任务，然后执行后续操作即可；
① 生成屏幕截图
利用Airtest的截图API生成截图

根据 AOSP（Android 开源项目）上的讨论，小米工程师提议给安卓添加 SELinux 策略以禁止提取 apk 文件，让用户只能通过官方商店或授权网站下载应用，小米的理由是 apk 文件可能含有来自私有来源的数据，比如其中的图像可能会被其他人拿来重复使用。但谷歌拒绝了这一提议。

将云计算引入机器人操作系统

由于重量和功率要求，机器人的机载计算能力往往受到限制，它们也很少有硬件加速器，如 GPU、TPUS 或 FPGA。但许多机器人算法和最近的进展都得益于高端计算机和硬件加速器。伯克利人工智能研究实验室正在开发开源机器人操作系统 FogROS。他们设想使用云计算来加速缓慢的计算，可以使机器人在相同的时间内做更多的事情。他们已经开放了 FogROS 2 预览版。FogROS 2 将 SLAM 延迟降低了 50%，将抓取规划时间从 14 秒减少到 1.2 秒，并将运动规划速度提高了 28 倍，与替代方案相比 FogROS 2 将网络使用率降低了 3.8 倍。

老王点评：云计算是大脑，而这些机器人就是它的手臂，可以预期将来的机器人会更强大，但是我总有对这种有强大智能的机器人一些恐惧。</span>

Many organizations have security policies in place that dictate how to store sensitive information. When you&#x27;re developing applications for the cloud, you&#x27;re probably expected to follow those policies, and to do that you often have to externalize your data storage. Kubernetes has a built-in system to access external secrets, and learning to use that is key to a safe cloud-native app.
In this article, I&#x27;m going to demonstrate how to build a Quarkus reactive application with externalized sensitive information—for instance, a password or token—using Kubernetes Secrets. A secret is a good example of how cloud platforms can secure applications by removing…</span>

Android开发中ViewPager+Fragment的懒加载
TabLayout+ViewPager+Fragment是我们开发常用的组合。ViewPager的默认机制就是把全部的Fragment都加载出来，而为了保障一些用户体验，我们使用懒加载的Fragment，就是让我们再用户可见这个Fragment之后才处理业务逻辑。
而我们在一些设备或版本中可能就出现懒加载失效的问题。其实谷歌早就把一些懒加载的方案都标记弃用了，我们一直都用的老的随时会失效的Api。万一哪天彻底失效了就会导致线上事故。
接下来我们就看看Fragment的懒加载是如何演变的。谷歌又是推荐我们如何使用的。
1. Support时代的懒加载
在AndroidX还没出来的时候，大家的懒加载应该都是这样。判断setUserVisibleHint的方法，当用户可见的时候才回调方法去加载逻辑。
例如的我封装：
abstract class BaseVDBLazyLoadingFragment : AbsFragment() {

    protected lateinit var mViewModel: VM
    protected lateinit var mBinding: VDB
    private var isViewCreated &#x3D; false//布局是否被创建
    private var isLoadData &#x3D; false//数据是否加载
    private var isFirstVisible &#x3D; true//是否第一次可见
    protected lateinit var mGLoadingHolder: Gloading.Holder

   …</span>

一、背景及问题
某 SDK 有 PopupWindow 弹窗及动效，由于业务场景要求，对于 App 而言，SDK 的弹窗弹出时机具有随机性。
在弹窗弹出时，若 App 恰好也有动效执行，则可能出现主线程同时绘制两个动效，进而导致的卡顿，如下图。
我们以水平移动的方块模拟App正在进行的动效（如：页面切换）；可以看出，在Snackabr 弹窗弹出时，方块动效有明显的卡顿（移动至约1/3处）。

这个问题的根本原因可以简述为：不可控的动效冲突（业务随机性） + 无从安置的主线程耗时方法（弹窗实例化、视图infalte）。
因此我们要寻求一个方案来解决动效冲突导致的卡顿问题。我们知道Android编码规范在要求子线程不能操作UI，但一定是这样吗？
通过我们的优化，我们可以达到最终达成完美的效果，动效流畅，互不干涉：

二、优化措施
**【优化方式一】：**动态设置弹窗的延迟实例化及展示时间，躲避业务动效。
**结论：**可行，但不够优雅。用于作为兜底方案。
**【优化方式二】：**能否将弹窗的耗时操作（如实例化、infalte）移至子线程运行，仅在展示阶段（调用show方法）在主线程执行？
**结论：**可以。attach前的view操作，严格意义上讲，并不是UI操作，只是简单的属性赋值。
**【优化方式三】：**能否将整个Snackbar的实例化、展示、交互全部放置子线程执行？
**结论：**可以，但有些约束场景，「UI线程」虽然大部分时候可以等同理解为「主线程」，但严格意义上，Android源码中从未限定「UI线程」必须是「主线程」。
三、原理分析
下面我们分析一下方案二、三的可行性原理

为了今年的 Google I/O 大会，Flutter 团队使用 Flutter 以及 Firebase 构建了一款经典的弹球游戏。下面将会介绍我们是如何通过 Flame 游戏引擎将 I/O 弹球游戏 带到 Web 端的。
游戏开发要点
使用 Flutter 打造用户交互类型的游戏是一个很棒的选择，例如拼图或者文字游戏这样的游戏。Flame 是一个在 Flutter 上构建的 2D 游戏引擎，当涉及到使用游戏循环的游戏时它会非常有用。I/O 弹球游戏使用了 Flame 提供的一系列特性，例如动画、物理引擎、碰撞检测等等，同时还借助了 Flutter 框架的基础架构。如果你能用 Flutter 构建应用，你就获得 Flame 构建游戏所需的基础。

游戏循环
通常来说应用屏幕在没有用户交互事件的时候都会保持视觉静止状态。游戏中则是相反的—— UI 会持续的渲染，而且游戏状态会不断变化。Flame 提供了一个 game widget，它内部管理了一个游戏循环，所以能恒定且高效地进行渲染。Game 类包含了游戏组件以及其逻辑的实现，然后被交给 widget 树中的 GameWidget。在 I/O 弹球游戏中，游戏循环反映了弹球在游戏场的位置以及状态，然后如果球与物体碰撞或跌出比赛则需要给出必要的反馈。

                              <span>协程（coroutines）的封装
在默认的Kotlin协程环境中,我们需要自定义协程的作用域CoroutineScope，还有负责维护协程的调度等等，有没有方法可以让协程的使用者屏蔽对底层协程的认识，简单就能使用呢？这里带来了一个封装思路。
封装前例子
假如我们有个一个suspend函数
suspend fun getTest():String{
    delay(5000)
    return &quot;11&quot;
}

我们要实现的封装是：
1.执行suspend函数，并且使用者对底层无感知，无需了解协程就可以使用，这就要求我们屏蔽CoroutineScope细节
2.自动类型转换，比如返回String我们就应该可以在成功的回调中自动转型为String
3.成功的回调，失败的回调等
4.要不，来个DSL风格
//
async{
    // 请求
    getTest()

}.await(onSuccess &#x3D; {
    //成功时回调,并且具有返回的类型
   Log.i(&quot;print&quot;,it)
},onError &#x3D; {

},onComplete &#x3D; {

})


可以看到，编译时就已经将it变为我们想要的类型了！
我们最终想要实现上面这种方式
封装开始
思路：我们自动对请求进行线程切换，使用Dispatchers即可，还有就是我们需要有监听的回调和DSL写法，所以就可以考虑用协程的async方式发起一个请求，返回值是Deferred类型，我们就可以使用扩展函数实现.await的形式！如果熟悉flutter的同学看的话，是不是很像我们的dio请求方式呢！下面是代码，可以根据更细节的需求进行补充噢：
fun  async(loader:suspend () -&gt;T): Deferred {
    val deferred &#x3D; CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).async {
        loader.invoke()
    }
    return deferred
}

fun  Deferred.await(onSuccess:(T)-&gt;Unit,onError:(e:Exception)-&gt;Unit,onComplete:(()-&gt;Unit)?&#x3D;null){
    CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {

        try{          
            val result &#x3D; this@await.await()     
            onSuccess(result)
            
        }catch (e:Exception){
            onError(e)
        }
        finally {
            onComplete?.invoke()
        }
    }
}

总结
是不是非常好玩呢！我们实现了一个dio风格的请求，对于开发者来说，只需定义suspend修饰的函数，就可以无缝使用我们的请求框架！

What advice would you give a new Linux user? We asked our community of writers to share their favorite Linux advice. 
1. Use Linux resources
My brother told me that Linux was like a &quot;software erector set&quot; (that&#x27;s a dated reference to the old Erector sets that could be purchased in the 1950s and 1960s) which was a helpful metaphor. I was using Windows 3.1 and Windows NT at the time and was trying to build a useful and safe K-12 school district website. This was in 2001 and 2002 and there were very few texts or resources on the web that were helpful. One of the resources recommended was the &quot;Root Users Guide,&quot; a very large book that had lots of printed information in it…</span>

Containers and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images are important open source application packaging and delivery technologies made popular by projects like Docker and Kubernetes. The better you understand them, the more able you will be to use them to enhance the consistency and scalability of your projects.
In this article, I will describe this technology in simple terms, highlight the essential aspects of images and containers for a developer to understand, then wrap up by discussing some best practices developers can follow to make their containers portable.

Nick老师有自己独特的催稿办法（不是
三个月憋不出一篇稿子，像极了鸽群1里的朋友们，但仔细想来「魔术不就是变鸽子么」，心理好受了些。刚在首页突然刷到一派·Podcast | 魔术练习生 - 少数派 (sspai.com)，惊呼在「在少数派居然还能…」的同时来了灵感，那就无所顾忌地、随手写一点关于魔术的东西，也未尝不是一个有意思的事儿。
那咱们开始。

我与魔术的这十几年
笔者自学魔术从2008年开始，正如介绍所讲是个「靠嘴变魔术的半职业魔术师」。因为手太容易出汗和发抖，手法魔术一事无成，所以只能在台词设计和语言艺术上下功夫；靠着对魔术的一知半解，在高中、大学的魔术社团都混了个社长，也在海口、北京以及合肥等地留下了一场场小型演出的足迹；甚至上学期间靠着不值一提的英文水平，在伦敦的碎片大厦，有过一场给中英领导的演出，还起了个艺术的名字 ——「香格里拉的前世今生」。

笔者的专业背景是管理学，毕业以来一直从事英文的教学教研，并于疫情后在合肥开了一门可以吹一辈子的「魔术选修课」（也是靠着它稿了今年的征文）；魔术于本人而言是一个难得坚持了十余年的爱好，更是通过学习魔术掌握了许许多多重要的职业和生存的技能。想要一篇文章把这段时间的收获都谈明白不是一件容易的事儿，我尽量。
魔术都是从百货开始的
刘谦老师春晚的鸡蛋和橡皮筋儿启蒙了一批属于这个时代的魔术爱好者，但笔者最早是被一套三杯球，带进的这条不归路。「三仙归洞」这一属于非物质文化遗产等级的传统魔术，是曾经海口市各大百货商场25元一套的畅销货，在那个互联网与线上购物不发达的年代，这一套三杯球足以吸引无数带着孩子的年轻家长驻足。

费曼技巧，又称费曼学习法，这个学习方法听上去十分简单，人人都可以学会掌握，然后就能提高自己的学习能力。然而，费曼学习法效果真的有这么好吗？没学这个方法的人是不是会竞争不过别人？有这么好的方法，为什么不早点服用呢？
本篇目标：打算用费曼技巧，来学习费曼技巧本身，也就是用其人之道还治其人之身。在探索之前，先明确一些信息：

费曼学习法的命名源自 Richard Feynman 这个物理学家。
费曼是个传奇的人物，获得过诺贝尔物理学奖，参与过曼哈顿计划，他的职业是大学教授，课程深受学生欢迎，并且处处显示出过人的智慧，被称为天才中的天才。
这个方法被认为极其有效，非常符合学习的本质。很多人推崇费曼学习法，并认为它是（所谓）十大学习方法之首。

网络上对于这个方法的介绍实在太多了，千篇一律，有些还以清华北大高分学生运用这个学习方法获得有益成绩作为实力背书，颇有一些原教的味道。因为费曼学习法对人没有要求，一听就明白，完全没有门槛，于是满眼看去，功利味道很浓。
我们马上来看一下这个独门秘籍是怎么样的，他到底靠不靠谱。
什么是费曼学习法？
网上宣传的费曼学习法，就是以教代学，可以归结为四个步骤。
费曼技巧 4 个步骤
第一个步骤，确定要学习研究的目标并且开始学习。

准备工作：找一张纸，这张纸很关键，这是你学习的一个载体。
明确目标：在这张纸上面，把要学习的这个对象，写在最上面这个位置。
实践要求：有了明确的目标之后，开始学习。并且，把学到的相关知识全部列在这个纸上面。

第二个步骤，开始教别人。

千变万化的「#」
当看到「#」时，你会想到什么？
如果你下国际象棋，它可以表示对局的终结1；如果你是程序员，它可以是注释的开始；如果你刷微博，它可以传递当前最热的话题。中文里，「#」通常称为「井字」或「井号」，在日语中称为「番号记号」或「井桁」，英式英语中则通常称为「hash」。
「#」的大部分名称来源于其形状，含义却随着上下文屡屡发生变化。对大部分人而言，与「#」的第一次会面，大概是电话拨号盘角落中那个不起眼的方块。
libra pondo 的千年的漫步
先将时间拨回罗马时代，那时「一磅重」被称为「libra pondo」，其中 libra 指「尺度」或「平衡」；pondo 则来自于动词 pendere，表示「称重」。从这两个词根中，「#」得到了它最初的形状与名称。
十四世纪晚期，来源于 libra 的「lb」进入了英语中，同时配上了一条表明其缩写身份的短线「~」，即「℔」。
由于「℔」在当时使用非常广泛，部分早期印刷机开始把它作为一个单独的字符进行印刷。
左图是 Isaac Newton 笔下的 ℔ 符号，右图是它出现在 1698 年印刷品中的样子。
随后，「℔ 」逐渐演变成了两个不同的形式：

来源于抄写员潦草笔记的「#」
没有短线修饰代表磅的「lb」

而这个符号本身，却则淹没在时间长河中。与此同时，libra 的老搭档 pondo 也开始了独自的演变之路。它先以 pund 的形式出现在古英语中，又在现代英语中成为 pound。历经数千年，libra 与 pondo，这一对古老的搭档，最终又重新连接在一起2。

TOEFL 和 GRE，是什么样的考试？
以 TOEFL 为代表的「英语语言能力测试」
TOEFL 的全称是「Test Of English as a Foreign Language」，即针对非英语母语人士的英语语言能力测试，由美国的教育测验服务社（ETS）命题并主持。
有关考试的详细介绍，可以在 ETS 官网的 TOEFL 页面下找到
语言能力测试（Language Proficiency Test）顾名思义，就是考查理解和使用语言的能力，即所谓的「听说读写」。TOEFL 考试的内容正是以此分为四个分项。
针对非英语母语人士，意味着 TOEFL 是一门「外语考试」。TOEFL 考查的重点在于，作为外国人的我们能否操持英语，在英语国家（特别是美国）正常学习、工作和生活。
因为是外语考试，TOEFL 对语言能力尤其是词汇量的要求并不算高。一般普遍认为备考 TOEFL 必要的英语词汇量在 8000-10000。作为对比，大学六级考试的词汇量要求是 5500-6000。也就是说，如果你具备六级水平，只要再积累 3000 词，就可以达到 TOEFL 考试的要求。
与 TOEFL 等价的另外一种英语语言能力测试是 IELTS（雅思）。 我们若要去英语国家工作、学习或移民，通常需要提供这两种考试之一的成绩，且分数要满足一个最低要求。
以 GRE 为代表的「学术能力测试」
GRE 的全称是「Graduate Record Examination」，即研究生学术能力测试，同样由 ETS 命题并主持。

疫情封控两个月后，人变得愈发懒散，每天的成果只有吃饭睡觉。为了摆脱这种状态，我决定在书房对自己进行 24 小时的监控录像，督促自己提升效率。
自我监控方案有两点需求：首先，软硬件必须在本地操作、储存，绝对不能联网；其次工作中途经常离开书房，回放时能跳过无人片段。
寻找监控工具：

视频剪辑软件：自动识别长时间静止的画面，删除或加速相关视频帧。
录屏软件：带移动侦测功能，检测到人则开启录像，无人则自动暂停，无需联网就能使用。
播放软件：自动跳过超过 10s 的静止画面。
直连电脑的摄像机：不联网，不用 SD 卡将视频直接存储在电脑上。虽然萤石、小米有移动侦测功能，但视频需上传云端，风险过大。

找了许久，始终找不到合适的工具。监控摄像头和行车记录仪能跳过静止画面，但这类工具都不能直连电脑，且限制很多，不方便后期回放剪辑。
最后靠着少数派群友 @chen 的推荐，尝试 DVR-Scan，补完了自我监控方案。
自我监控方案

晨间唤醒：起床后，用手机单独录一句话。这句话在前一天准备好，包括日期、当日目标，也可以引入美好的回忆、憧憬的未来、向往的地方、喜欢的艺术 (音乐、名画、诗句)。
晨间唤醒参考了 积极心理学，收集积极情绪材料，给自己创造美好的情绪。
录制视频：用 VLC 和摄像头录制视频，按计划开始工作学习。
过滤视频：晚上 11 点，DVR-Scan 过滤静止视频片段，记录录制时长和处理后的视频时长。

                              <span>我迷上 Super Auto pets 是在西班牙之旅的倒数第二天，玩了第一局之后一发不可收拾，玩到了半夜。第二天，去机场的路上在玩、等飞机的时候在玩、起飞前在玩、下飞机了还在玩。到现在一个多月了，虽然没那么上头了，但是一天还是会玩个好几次。
我去一些平台上看了一下这个游戏有多受欢迎。Super Auto Pets 在 Steam 上有 17,568 条评价，92%为 positive （ 5 月 11 日的数据）。YouTube 的搜索结果里，100k view 以上的视频比比皆是，最受欢迎游戏播主之一 ludwig 也有不少关于这个游戏的视频。在 Twitch 上，最高峰的观看者有 73.4k。
和一些游戏资深玩家比起来，我玩游戏的经验绝对称不上多。我一般喜欢的游戏都是即时战斗类，对于这类策略性游戏一直不感冒。但这次如此沉迷于这个游戏，我不禁想问：为什么？
（到目前为止我的游戏数据）
游戏的玩法
在展开讲为什么这个游戏受欢迎之前，我们有必要了解一下这个游戏是怎么玩的。
Super Auto Pets 是一个策略性游戏，你需要做的就是选择五只动物组成一个小队，和另外一个玩家的小队按照事先安排好的顺序完成自动战斗。
一场战斗大概是这样的：
（我为数不多的最终胜利之一）
整个游戏的机制并不复杂：
金币：每场开局玩家有 10 枚金币，购买动物和食物均花费 3 枚金币（药丸花费 1 枚）。
动物/食物能力：每个动物和食物都有不同的能力。比如大象的能力是“攻击前对下一个伙伴动物造成 1 点伤害”，孔雀的能力是“被攻击后增加 4 点攻击”，这样大象和孔雀就是很好的搭配。还有一些很有意思的动物能力，比如河马的能力是“消灭掉一个敌人后自身增加 4 点攻击和 2 点生命”，也就是说河马到了后期接近于无敌。食物的功能也很多样，比如巧克力的能力是“增加 1 点经验”，蘑菇的功能是“使用了蘑菇的…</span>

                              <span>一切都要从“书号”开始说起。
关于书号，在此引用百度百科的定义：

书号即ISBN，最直观的就是书的封底的条型码和那一串数字。是由中华人民共和国新闻出版总署分配给各个出版社的。国内的书号还在书的第二页（一般在扉页的反面）配有CIP数据，该页也称为版权页。这二者是在国内出版图书不可缺少的两个必要数据。
《乔布斯传》版权页
根据相关规定，书号由新闻出版总署分配给各个出版社，每年有一定配额，个人和民营企业无法申请书号。
简单来说，出版社是国企，每年从新闻出版总署那领到一定数量的书号资源，只有他们才有资格出版图书。知名的出版社有人民文学出版社、中信出版社、上海译文出版社等，他们经济效益好，出版图书多，书号紧俏。但另一些出版社，由于能力有限，图书出版数量不多，有书号闲余。
图书出版市场除了出版社，还有出版公司，他们有优秀的书籍策划能力和众多的图书版权资源，但由于是民营企业，没有书号申请资质，于是，出版公司便与有书号闲余的出版社合作，由出版公司编辑策划发行，出版社提供书号，负责审核，出版。一家出版社的书号可能有多家出版公司在使用，一家出版公司也会同时使用多家出版社书号。优秀的出版公司也有很多，例如新经典、果麦、磨铁、读客等。
除了出版社和出版公司，还有一个概念是图书品牌。有的出版公司或出版社自身的名字即为图书品牌，比如新经典文化的“新经典”、磨铁文化的“磨铁”、读库文化的“读库”，人民文学出版社、三联书店等；有的图书品牌则是出版公司或出版社的子品牌，比如译林出版社旗下的“方尖碑”品牌、社会科学文献出版社旗下的“甲骨文”品牌、广西师范大学出版社直属机构北京贝贝特出版顾问旗下的“理想国”品牌。
以上就是关于出版社、出版公司和出版品牌三者之间的联系。不同出版社和出版公司因为自身发展原因，会侧重不同的方向，形成自己的优势领域，比如中信出版社的经济管理类书籍、新星的推理小说、上海译文出版社的外国…</span>

从本月初开始，我和几位朋友一起做了一个小小的写作共学实验。我把它叫做「G·写作共学」。这个共学的长期目的当然是在以 GRE Issue 为代表的高水平写作测试中达到高分的要求。至于短期目标嘛，……应该是「用汉语写一篇合格的英语作文」吧。
为什么要用汉语写英语作文题？或者说，作为经历过高考、接受过似乎还不错的语文教育的成年人，我们为什么要回到如此基础的写作训练上呢？
用汉语写英语作文有什么用？
要回答这个问题，我们可以先追溯一下这类英语写作测试的评分标准。GRE Issue 的评分标准包括下列五项：

清晰且有效地陈述观点
以恰当的说理和事例支持观点
文章结构清晰完整、重点突出
内容流畅、表述精确、句式多样且措辞考究
使用合乎标准的英语书面语进行写作

另一个性质类似的写作测试是 TOEFL 的独立写作部分。该部分的评分标准由这样四个维度组成：

针对话题和题目要求做出清晰的表述
结构完整，解释、例证和细节清晰到位
内容连贯、有序且通顺
使用合乎标准的书面英语进行写作。

与 TOEFL 独立写作性质和作用相当的雅思大作文（Task 2）的评分维度则是「写作任务回应情况」「连贯与衔接」「词汇丰富程度」「语法多样性及准确性」。
由此可见，无论是语言能力考试（TOEFL 和雅思），还是逻辑能力测试（GRE），在话题写作这部分考查的能力，至少有一半和「英语」无关，而关联于普适性的「思维」。
把上述评分标准中所有的「英语」换成「汉语」，就会很容易得到得到「一篇好的汉语文章」的评价标准。如果你能写出或者「想」出这样一篇好的汉语文章，并在此基础上把它按照英语的写作习惯转换（注意，不是「直译」）成英语文章，就是一篇可以拿到高分的英语文章。
我们在练习这些考试的写作部分时，其实训练了自己的两项能力：
其一是思维能力，也即，用自己的母语（或者说，作为思考载…</span>

umami 看板
之前写了一篇《免费的个人博客系统搭建及部署解决方案（Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis）》，讲述了一下我使用 Serverless 和一些开源项目搭建的博客系统，也开了个系列来记录搭建过程。
前几天看到 Reorx 写的一篇 《搭建 umami 收集个人网站统计数据》，他介绍了 umami 这个项目，并使用 Railway 进行无服务搭建部署。
只不过我因为之前部署 Cusdis 的时候使用的是 Heroku 提供的免费 Postgres 数据库服务并用 Vercel 进行部署，于是在部署 umami 的时候还是想沿用原来的平台，减少搭建和维护成本。
下文会对具体搭建部署流程做个记录，因为官方支持一键部署方式，整个搭建流程很顺畅。
搭建部署说明
使用 Heroku 创建 Postgres 数据库
创建 POSTGRES 数据库
首先注册一个 Heroku 账号，登录成功后，点击右上角按钮创建一个新的应用。

输入实例名称，地区可以自行选择，我选择的是 United States，点击创建。

创建完成后，在 Resources Tab 的 Adds-on 中搜索选择 Postgres 数据库。

选择 Free Plan 即可，Heroku 中的 Postgres 数据库是免费的，可以持续使用，免去了搭建维护成本。

创建完成后，在 Setting 中查看 DATABASE_URL，后面部署要用到。

点击新增的 Postgres add-on 跳转进行设置。

进入后，选择 Setting 页面的 View Credentials，并且记录配置参数。

初始化 POSTGRES 数据库
因为需要初始化数据库，我使用的是 DataGrip 数据库管理工具进行连接，比较方便，也可以通过 Heroku CLI 进行连接和配置。

我们对Crash率的治理目标设置为了0.03%。
治理前的整体状况
App的Crash率高达5+%，随着产品的不断迭代，复杂度不断提升，给Crash率降低带来巨大挑战，我们必须在处理好新生的Crash的同时针对遗留的Crahs进行清理。Crash部分分为两部分，Native部分crash占比高达72%，这部分的Crash主要来源于Flutter、第三方的地图和第三方的SDK，难以解决。Java部分的crash很多没有得到及时解决，大量遗留的历史债，多数有通用的解决方案。
Crash治理方法
常见Crash的处理方式
根据Crash统计平台的堆栈，用户日志，操作路径定位和解决
寻找共性，机型、品牌、系统版本、所在页面、用户操作等辅助解决问题
复现场景，能够复现通常就很容易解决，可以线下复现或者云真机复现
其他处理方式
对crash率较高的模块进行业务梳理，排查，重构等
与第三方sdk沟通升级解决问题，修改SDK的使用方式
Crash治理实践
由于内部的统计平台建设比较晚，我们只能获取到近期的Crash率变化，可以看到Crash率明显收敛。

1. 缘起
这两天在研究 CupertinoSliverRefreshControl 组件，使用中有个小细节吸引到了我的注意。在下拉达到一定程度时，会有 weng 的一声震动感。然后翻看源码中的具体实现逻辑，在下拉量大于 refreshTriggerPullDistance 时，会触发 HapticFeedback.mediumImpact(); 方法。看到 Feedback 一词，也就知道这是震动反馈触发的方法了。

2.  HapticFeedback 类的介绍
HapticFeedback 非常简单，私有构造，且提供五个静态方法，很明显是一个工具类。

其中有五个方法，从体感上来说，五种方法的震感不同，其中 vibrate 和 lightImpact 感觉上没有太大差别。mediumImpact 相对较弱，heavyImpact 很弱，最后 selectionClick 不知道是我手机问题还是什么，似乎没有震感。
vibrate ≈ lightImpact &gt; mediumImpact &gt; heavyImpact &gt; selectionClick

HapticFeedback 源码中介绍提到，这里的 API 故意设计的比较简洁，只是调用平台的默认行为，并不能达到精确控制系统震动模块目的。也就是说，这里就是简单震动一下，并无法精确控制振幅、震动时长等信息。

对于 Android 来说，这五个方法分别对应 HapticFeedbackConstants 中的五个常量：
vibrate    ----   HapticFeedbackConstants.LONG_PRESS
lightImpact    ----   HapticFeedbackConstants.VIRTUAL_KEY

前言
Android的稳定性是Android性能的一个重要指标，它也是App质量构建体系中最基本和最关键的一环。如果应用经常崩溃率，或者关键功能不可用，那显然会对我们的留存产生重大影响。

稳定性优化的正确认识
稳定性优化的关键指标
要做稳定性优化，首先一个问题就是，要做成什么效果？Crash率多少算优秀呢?在明确了目标之后，我们才能正确认识我们的工作到底有什么作用
要计算Crash率，我们首先应该明白稳定性优化的一些关键指标
UV Crash率与PV Crash率
PV（Page View）即访问量， UV（Unique Visitor）即独立访客，0 - 24小时内的同一终端只计算一次
UV Crash率：针对用户使用量的统计，统计一段时间内所有用户发生崩溃的占比，用于评估Crash率的影响范围。
PV Crash率：针对用户使用次数的统计，评估相关Crash影响的严重程度。
大家可以根据自己的需要选择合适的指标，需要注意的是，需要确保一直使用同一种衡量方式。
Crash率评价
那么，我们App的Crash率降低多少才能算是一个正常水平或优秀的水平呢？
Java与Native的总崩溃率必须在千分之二以下。
Crash率万分位为优秀
注意，以上说的都是UV崩溃率
稳定性优化的维度
很多人都会认为稳定性优化就是降低Crash率，但如果你的APP没有崩溃，但是关键功能却不可用，这又怎么算是稳定的呢?
1、Crash纬度：最重要的指标就是应用的Crash率。
2、性能纬度：包括启动速度、内存、绘制等等优化方向，相对于Crash来说是次要的，但也是应用稳定性的一部分。
3、业务高可用纬度：它是非常…</span>

一、前言
责任链模式

作用：避免请求的发送者和接收者之间的耦合关系，将这个对象连成一条链，并沿着这条链传递该请求，直到有一个对象处理它为止。
举例：OKHttp 的拦截器、Servlet 中的 FilterChain
二、使用责任链模式
例子：学生会经费申请
重点：1 个请求会在 n 个处理器组成的处理器链上传递
以学生会经费申请会例，学生会会有一些日常开销以及活动开支，需要向学院的学生会基金申请经费，如果金额在 100 元之内，由分部长审批；如果金额在 100 到 500 元之间，由会长审批；如果金额在 500 到 1000 元之间，由学院辅导员审批；而如果金额超过 1000 元，则默认打回申请。像这种需要一层层往后传递请求的情况，非常适合采用责任链模式来设计程序：
/**
 * 经费申请事件
 *
 * @author GitLqr
 */
data class ApplyEvent(val money: Int, val title: String)

/**
 * 经费审批处理器
 *
 * @author GitLqr
 */
interface ApplyHandler {
    val successor: ApplyHandler?
    fun handleEvent(event: ApplyEvent)
}

注意：责任链模式需要将处理器对象连成一条链，最简单粗暴的方式就是让前驱处理器持有后继处理器 successor
接着，根据案例需要，编写各个角色对应的处理器类：
/**
 * 部长
 *
 * @author GitLqr
 */
class GroupLeader(override val successor: ApplyHandler?) : ApplyHandler {

先看效果：

呐，就上图实现的功能（可能官方有，可我没找到；可能插件有，可我没找到）。

不说废话了，直接开整。
思路分析：
其实悬浮组件大家应该都知道，Flutter中的全局悬浮用的Overlayer。
那这个组件的重要部分就是让已经悬浮的选项列表跟随滚动，这里用到的是CompositedTransformTarget以及与它配对的跟随组件CompositedTransformFollower
其实官方的TextField的SelectionToolbar就已经是一个很好的例子了，来看图。

从上图就可以看到，SelectionToolbar实际上就是跟随文本框滚动而滚动的。
那么，具体的实现呢？接着往下看。
tips: 正片从第4步开始，可以直接略过1、2、3步。
1. TextField 中的 SelectionToolbar 的拆解
CompositedTransformTarget 与 CompositedTransformFollower
这两个组件才是 ！关键！
对于它们俩，在官方docs中的解释：
CompositedTransformTarget
CompositedTransformFollower
好吧（反正我一看文档就头疼)。简单来说就是：CompositedTransformTarget 作为目标，CompositedTransformFollower作为跟随，通过一个 LayerLink 来链接，当CompositedTransformTarget发生变换(偏移)时，CompositedTransformFollower将自动跟随变换(偏移)。
我们可以直接定位到官方 TextField 下的相关代码。

什么是RemoteAnimation
RemoteAnimation是Android 9中为实现 同步应用过渡动画 而新增的API。
同步应用过渡动画（Synchronized App Transitions）是用以改进应用过渡动画架构的一项功能。
在Android系统中应用于Launcher和SystemUI的的应用过渡动画和切换动画中。
效果演示
应用启动动画可以将主屏幕图标无缝转换为应用 Surface
通知启动动画可以将通知转换为应用 Surface
实现原理
https://source.android.google.cn/devices/tech/display/synched-app-transitions?hl&#x3D;zh-cn
当用户打开、关闭应用或在应用之间切换时，SystemUI或Launcher进程会向系统发送逐帧控制动画的请求，同时保证在View动画和窗口动画之间进行同步。SystemUI 或启动器在动画过程中绘制新的帧时，会在动画应用Surface请求一个不同的Transform，这个Transform可以确定应用在屏幕上的组成形式，并标记要与SystemUI或Launcher目前正在绘制的帧同步的请求（SurfaceControl.Transaction）。

这个朋友曾前后撞碎了三辆TREK Madone，卖10万顶配的那种，江湖人称马东没。

后来事情就往奇怪的方向发展了，一方面身边的马东居然越来越多，另一方面有马东没到场的每次骑行至少有一辆马东出事，轻则爆胎零速摔，中则丢个桶轴快拆，重的话不是断架子就是断骨头的，没错，后来在马东没的光环照耀下又断了几个架子，最近那个还不到一个月。

为此，我们总结了马东没三大定律。

有钱真好。
凡马东没出场，需献祭一辆马东保平安。
凡马东没出场，记得买保险。

作为一个骨灰级的马东爱好者，很苦恼，友谊的小火车说碎就碎？
如何在和马东没愉快骑车的同时保护好我心爱的马东呢？毕竟我还是很喜欢我的Madone 9 Project By Myself的。

古人有云：君子以思患而豫防之，知己知彼百战不殆。有道理。
那如何才能在骑车时知道身边状况呢？总不能像汽车那样装个雷达吧。

等等，这个可以有。佳明是有款自行车雷达来着？

 
大概看了看，这玩意儿居然也有些历史了，都到第三代了——Varia RTL515和RVR315。515本质上是个集成了雷达的尾灯，而315就是个纯粹的雷达，这么看来，515是个不错的选择，搞！
拿到515，还是佳明祖传的证件照风格包装，熟悉的味道，一样的配方，卡在硬壳上的机体，四个适应不同风格坐管的底座、没用的说明手册、以及祖传的Micro-USB数据线。

都21世纪第三个十年了，佳明还在用Micro-USB口，很好奇佳明的Micro-USB元件库存和苹果的五福一安充电器谁更多一点。

Varia 515体型小巧，和一块码表差不多大，整个造型也非常简洁，一个主灯，一个微小的状态灯，一个按钮，没了。

长按按钮打开尾灯，此时状态灯会间断闪烁蓝灯。短按能在闪烁、强光、弱光之间切换，而更好的选择是适配你的佳明码表，然后自动控制，尾灯随着码表开关…</span>

第二节链接：护肤是门学问：我该如何进行清洁和保湿
养儿不防老，防晒才防老
这句话你大概已经在各位护肤博主哪里听腻了，但是我还是要在强调一次：防老的第一步就是要防晒。光老化问题是导致皮肤老化的重要元凶，紫外线才是你身边最危险的杀手，所以严格防晒是你开始防老的第一步。
紫外线的危害
紫外线中，可以对皮肤造成损伤的部分主要是长波紫外线（UVA）和短波紫外线（UVB）两种光波，它们的波段和波长都不同，对皮肤的损伤表现也有区别。
UVB是“表面杀手”，波长只能到达皮肤表层，最大的危害就是晒红、晒伤。大多数对紫外线过敏的人，都是对UVB的损伤非常敏感。UVA则负责“深层破坏”，往往能能够穿透到真皮层，带来晒黑、皱纹和色斑等问题。无论哪一种伤害，对皮肤健康来说都是不容小视的。所以防嗮是一个既要治标，又要治本的过程。
UVA与UVB的损害（图片源自网络）
防晒的选择
防晒能力评价标准
既然需要治标和治本双管齐下，那么在选择防晒产品的时候就需要两方面并重。防晒产品一般也会标榜自己两方面的防护力：PA与SPF。PA是指对UVA的防护力度，以“+”的数量多少来衡量防护能力的强弱；SPF是指对UVB的防护力度，以数值的大小来衡量防护能力的大小。综合两者来看，市面上的防晒产品的防护力可以分成三个不同等级：
低防护力：SPF&lt;30 PA++ 及以下
中防护力：SPF&#x3D;30~50  PA+++

前言
之前几篇我们介绍了贝塞尔曲线的原理、绘制曲线和动效实现，这些都是代码预设好的，如果我们要根据需要自行绘制曲线，就需要使用交互来实现了。本篇我们先来介绍简单的交互式绘图，通过获取触控位置来设定贝塞尔曲线的控制点，从而实现交互式绘制曲线。
获取触控位置
第一个要解决的问题是如何获取手指在屏幕的触控位置。在 Flutter 中，提供了一个 Listener 组件，可以监听各类触控事件。Listener 的组件构造方法定义如下：
const Listener({
  Key? key,
  this.onPointerDown,
  this.onPointerMove,
  this.onPointerUp,
  this.onPointerHover,
  this.onPointerCancel,
  this.onPointerSignal,
  this.behavior &#x3D; HitTestBehavior.deferToChild,
  Widget? child,
}) 

其中onPointerXX都是触控事件的回调方法，在回调里会携带触控的位置信息，具体的参数如下：
onPointerDown：触控点按下去（类似鼠标按下未释放）时的回调方法，携带了一个PointerDownEvent参数，该参数会包含点按信息，其中有一个localPosition参数，即当时点按时的位置。
onPointerUp：触控点按 松开（类似鼠标按下后释放）时的回调方法，携带了一个PointerUpEvent参数，该参数会包含点按信息，其中有一个localPosition参数，即当时点按时的位置。
onPointerMove：按下后移动（拖动）时的回调方法，携带了 PointerMoveEvent参数，包…</span>

1、使用方式
使用起来非常简单，首先你要准备如下的环境，
准备 Python 语言环境: Python3
添加 pyymal 库: pip install pyyaml
添加 requests 库: pip install requests
添加 requests_toolbelt 库: pip install requests_toolbelt
然后，通过编辑配置文件 config.yml 对脚本进行配置。比如，
build:
  gradlew: ../
  file: ../app/build.gradle
  ndk:
    abi_64: ndk {abiFilters &#x27;arm64-v8a&#x27;, &#x27;x86_64&#x27;}
    abi_32: ndk {abiFilters &#x27;armeabi-v7a&#x27;, &#x27;x86&#x27;}
  apk_output_dir: ../app/build/outputs/apk/prod/release

是的，你没看错，现在就要带你适配 Android13。
2022 的Google I/O 发布了 Android 13 beta 2 和  Android 13  Beta 1 国内厂商的设备支持列表，虽然按照惯例， Android 13 应该是年末才发布正式版，但是相信有的开发者已经收到了平台的 Android13 的适配要求，所以本篇也是结合 Oppo 的 Android 13 应用兼容性适配指导 和官方提供的一些文档内容做一个整理测试。

目前 Android 13 主要的兼容问题还是在于隐私权限上，所以本次的适配指南相关内容也是着重在这一部分， 这里涉及面比较广的应该就是相册和通知权限。
相册权限
这个动图大家可能看到过，这是 Android 13 上提供的系统图片选择器，通过 Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_PICK_IMAGES); 就可以打开，支持视频、音频、图片分类，支持多选和单选 ，另外官方也表示过，这个特性不仅仅会在 Android 13 中出现，谷歌还会将其放置到 Play 商店中，向 Android 11 和 Android 12 设备推送。

我们通过调整 TargetSDK 设置为 PreView，然后运行到 Tiramisu 的模拟器上进行测试，主要测试 TargetSDK 在低于 &quot;Tiramisu&quot; 和等于 &quot;Tiramisu&quot; 时的不同情况。

如下图所示：
图 1 是 TargetSDK 低于 13 时运行在  Andorid 13 模拟器上的情况，此时可以正常访问到本地图库相关信息；
图 2 是使用了  &quot;Tiramisu&quot;  下，通过官方提供的 Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_PICK_IMAGES); 打开的系统相册选择组件，也没问题
