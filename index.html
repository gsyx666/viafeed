                    <span>&quot;If you don&#x27;t know all of these, don&#x27;t call yourself a web developer&quot;, followed by some list of web dev related terms. Have you encountered one of these posts before? I come across them every once in a while on social media.
These sorts of divisive claims bring about nothing but toxicity to our community, and only alienate the junior developers who are new to it. Especially for the profit of some traffic on Twitter or elsewhere, it&#x27;s despicable.
They paint a completely wrong image of the web dev scene, too - being a web developer is much more about the perpetual process of self-improving, learning new tools &amp; technologies and experimenting with methods to combine them in the best way, rather than knowing some constant list of terms (which are often occasionally useful at best). And, built …</span>

                    <span>Lately, I&#x27;ve been tending to lean more towards employing a monolithic approach in system architecture. On paper, using micro-services seems like an ideal solution. The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I&#x27;ve watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.
I&#x27;m not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn&#x27;t really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.
So my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?</span>

Literally, developing a game engine is not on my resume... yet! So any code or ways of doing anything you read here, is just what I&#x27;ve figured out and works for me, which by no means should suggest to you that it is the proper way to do what ever it may be. Please consult your local guru first.
OK, now that we have that established... Please consider the following as entertainment and should you lean along the way with me, that&#x27;s wonderful!
Now, by the time of writing this article, I am several months into this undertaking. I&#x27;ll describe in future posts what the engine is capable of, but for today, let me tell you about what happened over the last 2 weeks. I will likely break them up into separate posts for easier consumption.

                    <span>Video is one of the best ways for capturing audience attention. Product demonstrations, property tours, tutorials, and keynotes all make great content—provided that they’re readily searchable by your team and visitors alike. Even though tagging and categorization help organize videos and make them easy to find, the labeling process is labor intensive, taking time away from key tasks like creating new videos.
The solution? Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content. Video tagging extends image classification to image sequences, capable of detecting types of scenes (cities, mountains, the seaside) and objects (people, cars), and even inferring whether the content is appropriate for public viewing.

                    <span>Functional components in React are most beautiful because of React Hooks. With Hooks, we can change state, perform actions when components are mounted and unmounted, and much more.
While all these are beautiful, there is a little caveat (or maybe not) that is a little bit frustrating when working with useEffect hook.
Before we look at this issue let&#x27;s do a quick recap on the useEffect hook.
The useEffect hook allows you to perform actions when components mount and unmount.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // actions performed when component mounts

  return () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // actions to be performed when component unmounts
  }
}, []);

The callback function of the useEffect function is invoked depending on the second parameter of the useEffect function.
The second parameter is an array of dependencies. You…</span>

                    <span>Just wrapped up Day 2 of Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent and from the Midnight Madness concert, to building an AI-Powered Image Processor during Talia Nassi&#x27;s workshop, to catching up with the amazing Adrienne Tacke from MongoDB....there is a TON going on Vegas! 
In this episode of the Tech Stack Playbook, I&#x27;ll be sharing more about AWS re:Invent - the year&#x27;s largest global tech conference that brings together leaders, builders, innovators, and creators from cloud, DevOps, serverless, app development, and software engineering from all around the world.
Also, I built an AI-Powered image processing application that can take images and analyze certain features about the uploaded images…so that was pretty cool 😱
In this blog post and the blog posts to come this week, my hope is to vlog through the entire week and share all that I&#x27;m learning and building with you all so whether you are attending virtually or in person, this AWS re:Invent series on the Tech Stack Playbook will help you gain skills, level up in tech, and boost your software engineering abilities from the sessions I&#x27;m attending throughout the conference.
Here’s a glance at what you’ll learn in this blog post:




It&#x27;s going to be a major week for cloud and tech in general, so I am so excited to bring you along for the ride.
What do you want to know about AWS, serverless, and DevOps? 💭

                    <span>Using Existing Tooling to Make Changes Reversible


This morning I deployed a major change to the production servers of DEV.to. 
Feature update: Feed - DEV Community.


Adjusting the feed is a big deal. It’s the front door of DEV.to.
We wanted to gather information about the impact of changing the front door. At Forem we use the Field Test gem. This allows us to run different experiments. I configured Field Test to assign 20% of the folks to the new strategy and 80% of the folks to the prior strategy.
To insulate from upstream libraries, we often wrap those libraries in our own implementations. This helps with the principle of least exposure; rely on the narrowest interface possible. I wrote the AbExperiment class to be the wrapper around Field Test. With the wrapper, I allowed for the sys…</span>

                    <span>话说现在密码泄露事件层出不穷，为了以后账户密码不怕被一锅端，很多人都想办法针对不同网站设置多个不同的密码 (我们专门为此撰写过一篇文章)，这样虽然更安全，但也稍微带来了记忆上的负担。
对于密码的存储与管理，我们之前介绍过 KeePass 和 LastPass，前者就是开源的本地帐号密码存储管理工具，后者提供浏览器插件，可记录下你每个网站的帐密并自动填写登录。不过由于 LastPass 所有密码数据都是保存在网上的，很多人都担心其安全性。而今天介绍的 1Password 则集多家之长，支持手机、电脑多平台同步，密码保存在本地，是目前我认为是我见过的最完美的密码管理解决方案……

                    <span>悲观主义哲学家叔本华曾说：

生命是一团欲望，不满足则痛苦，满足则无聊，人生就在痛苦和无聊之间摇摆。

不知他如果穿越到 2021 年，见识了一个被短视频包围，在微博和豆瓣鹅组左右横跳，以第一时间吃瓜的现代社会之后，还会坚持自己的观点吗？
但其实「无聊」一词，有着丰富的内涵。它不是一种无所事事的虚无，而应该是一种有意为之，为「有聊」而蓄力的状态。
说起「有聊」，又是一个被消费主义重新定义（或者说是被创造出来的）的词。何为「有聊」?难道春天去樱花树下、夏天去海边冲浪、秋天去山林里露营、冬天去雪山滑雪，就是所谓的「有聊」吗?
无聊抑或有聊，值得得好好聊聊。
第七期再读播客，我们请到《你有权保持无聊》一文的作者 @Shooca （当然也是 @重新想象Lab 专栏主理人），来一起聊聊关于「无聊」的话题。

作为一个苹果全家桶用户，Apple Music 是我欣赏音乐的不二选择。比起国内的音乐 App 那些「花里胡哨」的社交和直播功能，它干净且纯粹的听歌体验和低廉的价格获得了身边不少朋友的好评。然而，我所使用的 Apple Music 却和别人的有那么点「不一样」：尽管 Apple Music 的曲库已经在不断完善，而我也开了大陆和香港两个地区的订阅，但在我的 iPhone 和 iPad 上，「同步资料库」的按钮却一直是关闭的。
没错，在 2021 年的今天，我依旧坚定着拒绝着音乐订阅制，还在用着 20 年前的方式来听歌：购买 &gt; 下载 &gt; 同步 &gt; 欣赏。所以从某种角度上来看，iPod 这个东西的灵魂一直都存在于我的 iPhone 和 iPad 中，未曾消逝过。

而谈到「音乐订的订阅制」，往往离不开的另一个词语便是「流媒体」。要分清楚的是，我并不拒绝流媒体，因为它本质是一种技术，指的就是服务提供商可以将一系列的媒体文件打包压缩之后放到服务器上，经由互联网实时传输来让用户欣赏内容，而不需要耗费大量的时间在下载这件事情上。简单来说，一切「在线欣赏」的媒体、游戏内容，都归属于流媒体的范畴。我虽然没有开启 iCloud 资料库同步，但我却并不拒绝使用这种技术来欣赏媒体内容。
但音乐订阅制不同，它最核心的一个特点是「租赁」。也就是说，你所拥有的仅仅只是在服务商所规定的生效时段内聆听这首音乐的权利。这些音乐服务商就像你所租房的房东一样，给钱就能留下，不给钱就说再见。只不过一般而言，流媒体音乐服务商们不会因为你拖欠房租而「赶你出门」—— 因为根…</span>

                    <span>点进来的时候是不是以为，我写的肯定不是「把手机时间调早四个小时，给足心理暗示，就算十点起也是一种六点起」这种自欺欺人的方法？
……不好意思啊，还真就是调表这么简单。只不过我是反着调的，而且只调了两个小时。
所以现在每天早上八点闹钟准时把我叫醒，按照正常世界的时间流速，我真的是早上六点起来的。
你到底为什么会有这种奇怪的想法啊
最初当然是因为英国绝望的冬令时制度，十月最后的周日晚上，夏令时结束，时间往后调一小时，回到了格林尼治标准时间（Greenwich Mean Time, GMT）。
这也带来了所有住在高纬度地区人类的共同烦恼：天黑太早，特别致郁。NHS 还专门有一个网页，提供季节性抑郁（Seasonal Affective Disorder, SAD）的相关信息。
现在只是十一月中，然而每天下午四点钟的时候天就黑了，并且还在不断提前中。加上英国特有的阴雨天气，曾经一月有几次三点出门就天黑得不行。没有光明的时间里，无论实际时间如何，常给我一种「到了入睡时间」的感觉，想要做事都提不起精神来。

我刚来英国的时候十六七岁，整个人有用不完的能量，伦敦又是个远超我此前居住地的国际大都市，娱乐和学习上头的时候哪管白天黑夜，加上一个人住没人管我，通宵达旦还能神清气爽，面不改色吃光半桶炸鸡。哪懂什么熬夜胸口痛啊，脱发啊，长痘啊，留学就是好山好水好寂寞啊——「网上的人都在说什么屁话！」1
就是报应来得太快，人生哪有第二个十七岁呢……！
四点多天黑这件事在我的认知里，从「以前开膛手杰克就是在这里杀人的吧，好刺激」「在图书馆里开灯学习，好有氛围」变成了「我不会走路上被人杀了吧」「天黑了学什么习，我要睡觉」。
两年前的某一个下午，上了一天学回家的我走在路灯下，脑子里不断想着长长的 to-do-list，得出的结论是「世界和我快点有一个完蛋吧」。回到家提不起精神学习，想找朋友聊天，却因为时差的缘…</span>

笔者按：本文有视频版本，但视频文案与本文有较多区别。文章对理论的阐述更清晰，视频则宽泛且综合些。若对理论感兴趣，更推荐阅读文章。
 
一直以来，我对于「如何构筑系统」都有着深厚的兴趣，前后也写了一些自己的思考和实践。几个月前，我发表了一篇名为《打造宿舍收纳系统》的文章，尝试从桌搭入手讲述一些建立收纳系统的思路。文章收获了一些好评，不过我始终觉得有的地方还是没说到位，对方法论的描述不够具体，介绍产品太多，谁若想要借鉴，很多信息可能难以复用。
《东西我都装好了｜由极致性价比打造的宿舍收纳系统》
现在，当毕业后回顾曾经的宿舍生活，我终于逐渐参悟埋藏于产品背后的收纳逻辑。所以，这次我想再来聊一聊，到底如何构筑收纳系统。
先解构后建构
「收纳」本质上是解决「人」和「环境」之间的矛盾。任何收纳都是协调的结果，是一种谈判，是在有限空间前提下的排列组合。同时，既然解构是一切建构的前提，那么要「构筑收纳系统」，就要分别理解「人」和「环境」这两大因素。
生活中「人」的需求
早起来不及吃早饭，会觉得饿，于是学会提前一晚准备面包；存放面包需要空间，于是在桌面上随手一丢……这是很常见的做法。这也是最基本的收纳逻辑：「人」产生需求，需求需要产品来满足，而「环境」容纳产品。所以，在讨论如何使桌面井井有条之前，首先要明白自己的生活需求有哪些。
列需求，这项工作有些像产品经理。做产品的一项重要工作是为需求排序，确立优先级。我们也要做同样的事，所以别急着漫无目的地空想，还是采用些理论更成体系——试试大名鼎鼎的「马斯洛需求层次」吧。

                    <span>谢邀。
从业30年，这问题我可能能答108条？
但是最初的，总是最难忘的。那是一切的起点……那时，我还不是漫画家。
回忆001-“画王和他的姐姐”

这幅画来自遥远的1994年，创作时间是1月，还在《雪椰》之前……那年我17。
它诞生的原因，来自我在某小学旁的小书店，发现了《画书大王》的第七期。我被封面的《龙珠》瞬间秒到，很快就买下了它。原本以为这是盗版书商学习香港杂志搞出来的盗版作品合集，但当我翻开它时，竟意外地发现它上面竟刊登着真真切切的国产漫画作品！而且，它它它……居然还接受投稿！！！

彼时一直在找寻能投稿平台的我，恨不得当场就给它跪了！
我扫荡了书店里所有的过期《画王》，回家细读。然后就发现了这个：

“先把这玩意参加咯，然后就投稿！”我这么想着，一分钟也没耽搁，立刻铺开画纸开始设计。
从小就喜欢不按规则行事的我，一口气就画下了“两个画王”。然后振振有词地在设计说明里写了老大一篇：“私以为画王不应只有一人，亦应考虑女性读者需求，所以应为其设计一位姐姐，画王11岁，姐姐14，5，既让女读者也能找到共鸣点，又能照顾年龄稍大之读者的阅读感受……至于为甚给“画王”设计姐姐而不是妹妹，是因为除年纪外尚要考虑角色个性，11岁男童要可爱合适懵懂淘气，小大人乖乖仔会惹人厌恶。而出于性格互补另一角色应温柔知性，此种性格用于姐姐身上合适……且不应互换，知性哥哥和调皮妹妹不讨喜……“
光角色说明，我当年就写了2大页吧……？也不知有没吓着《画王》编辑……
我再找出自己平常的一些习作画稿，塞了至少有个6，7页进信封；（你们懂那种年少时拿着自己上百幅自认的惊世之作恨不得全给塞进去的心情不？哈哈哈……）又另写了一封3页纸阐述自己如何喜爱漫画，吹捧《画王》，并问询如何投稿的心里话……直至把信封塞爆……
换了新信封后，我用透明胶把它给封了两层边，才出街丢进邮筒，怀着对回信的憧憬，屁颠屁颠地蹦回了家。
两周后，我竟然收到了主编大人的亲笔回信！我被告知：”很可惜，你的稿件寄到时，画王设计征集活动早已截至。因此，基于公平原则，你的设计我们不能采纳。“但是：”我们觉得你的画很不错哦！你愿意尝试画个短篇故事投稿试试吗？你需要先……“
那天，我在我的小屋里，抓着回信，高举过头，发出了青春的咆哮！
不喜欢按规则行事的我，开始了《雪椰》的策划……并在回信里给主编说：“对不起……短篇我一时没有头绪，我想了个长篇您要不要看看……？”

咳咳，作为前几天实地蹲点摸排的人员之一，在去在这里涉事人出租屋去搜查违规军服和伪造文件时，我惊呆了！震惊的主要原因是：这么假，怎么能有人信？


在这里，有必要为广大战友正名，我们现役军人是不会拍这么多个人照的（宣传干事们不要打我……），更不会在网上发布带有军种符号标志和军衔的照片。其次，兄dei，你的肩章都要歪到天上去了，“穿了龙袍也不像太子”说的就是这哥们本人了，周身气质着实与军人不符啊！还有营长，是少校配置，这一毛三有点着急啊。

还穿着常服四处剪彩，这行为也属实迷醉。因为警备纠察的范围，只能对人员身份进行核查，并调查清楚军装来源与穿着目的，对违规军装进行没收，并没有执法权，所以涉事人已经被移交给“警察叔叔”立案处理了。后续有结果，小编也会第一时间告诉大家。军人，军装不容抹黑，欢迎大家加入发现“假军人”的打假队伍。
科普一下：根据我国《刑法》第三百七十二条【冒充军人招摇撞骗罪】规定：冒充军人招摇撞骗的，处三年以下有期徒刑、拘役、管制或者剥夺政治权利；情节严重的，处三年以上十年以下有期徒刑。日子挺有判头……

由于比邻的地缘格局和相近的文化传统，东亚各国在饮食习惯上有着很多共性。比如用筷子、喝粮食酒、蘸酱油调味、吃辣椒酱、吃腌渍蔬菜、吃白米饭、吃狗肉……几乎所有被中国人打上了鲜明标签的本民族餐桌元素，都能在朝鲜、韩国、日本、越南找到共鸣。腐乳，也许是唯一的例外。






这种由豆腐腌制发酵而来的小菜，廉价、鲜美、用途广泛。同时，它还完美解决了豆制品不耐存储运输的问题，是中国各地最常见的小菜之一。但神奇的是，同样对豆腐怀有热爱的朝鲜、韩国、日本和越南，却几乎见不到腐乳的影子。不吃腐乳，他们各有理由，诸如“有异味”“高盐”“不健康”，但似乎全然忘记了异味更大的日本纳豆，与含盐量同样高的韩国泡菜。历史上与中国有着千丝万缕联系的冲绳群岛，至今倒是依然流行着一种名为“豆腐糕“的食物。和腐乳一样，它依赖发酵改良豆腐的口感。



因为豆腐糕不能太咸，所以其制作过程只能依靠酒精来控制霉菌的滋生。在加入冲绳本地烈酒“泡盛“后，大量有益菌群被杀死，这就导致豆腐糕的发酵程度不够深，空有腐乳的质感，缺乏氨基酸为腐乳带来的，爆炸般的鲜味。本质上，冲绳豆腐糕只是一种类似腐乳的点心，它远远达不到腐乳的味觉高度。究竟是怎样的土壤，成就了酵变于腐乳之中的中餐滋味、隐藏于腐乳之外的华夏风韵、搭建于腐乳之上的汉唐美学？

制造腐乳的的原材料是豆腐，并且豆腐的含水量不能太高，需要达到一定的固形物密度。日本人发明的“绢豆腐”，是无法制造腐乳的。盐卤，是制作腐乳的先决要素。



虽然这种由氯化钾、氯化镁和溴化镁等杂质构成的制盐废料，具有一定的化学毒性，经常被当成健康饮食的反面教材。但没有朴素的盐卤参与，就无法“点”出干湿适度、软硬合宜的豆腐。纵观众多历史久远的腐乳产地，诸如浙江绍兴、广西桂林、山东临清、云南楚雄、福建莆田……它们有一个共同特点…</span>

《红楼梦》里，有一段耐人寻味的场景。香菱与一群小丫鬟玩，不慎弄脏了身上的“石榴红绫”裙子，小丫头们吓得一哄而散。“妇女之友”贾宝玉留了下来，拿了袭人的同款裙子给香菱。“（香菱）接了裙子，展开一看，果然同自己的一样。又命宝玉背过脸去，自己叉手向内解下来，将这条系上。香菱拉他的手，笑道：‘这又叫做什么？怪道人人说你惯会鬼鬼祟祟使人肉麻的事。’”成年人读到这里，总会露出一脸姨母笑。袭人什么身份？和贾宝玉试过“云雨情”的通房丫头。贾宝玉拿了袭人的裙子给香菱，香菱不但不避嫌，还当着男人的面换裙子。换完了，俩人还手拉手笑嘻嘻说话，嗔怪对方“肉麻”。曹雪芹同志就差把“性暗示”三个字写在纸上了。



石榴裙，是这则故事里的关键道具。事实上，在汉语言文字里，“石榴裙”三字在大多数语境下，都带着浓郁的桃色气息。它暗藏了中国人对性事只可意会不可言传的微妙观念，以及对石榴这种水果既充满向往、又随意亵玩的矛盾态度。作为一个外来物种，石榴也许不是在中国混得最好的水果，但它一定是最能融入汉文化的水果。

根据西晋张华《博物志》记载，石榴是张骞出使西域时，从石国带回来的植物。所谓“石国”，有可能是地处南疆至中亚的古国。今天，当地许多地名里，如喀什（kashgar）、克什米尔（kashmir）、塔什干（tashkent），依然常见许多带有“石”（sh）的音节。虽然石榴是不是张骞带回的植物已经不可考，但它源自西域却是肯定的。公元前十世纪，所罗门王就在肥沃的新月地带，栽种了石榴，并且爱饮用石榴汁榨的香酒。《雅歌》甚至用石榴来形容所罗门王喜爱的姑娘：“你的两颊裹在帕子内，如同一块石榴”。

                    <span>傲慢与偏见——谈谈2021年的轻厉和轻小说
既然去年头脑一热写了那个轻厉总结帖，那今年也延续一下习惯写点字，我的能力和眼界也不足以去谈轻小说的趋势、格局这种大东西，更没资格去评价排名是否公正，那就讲讲今年轻厉前10我读过的书，还有进了前100的我觉得还行的和没有进轻厉但我私心偏爱的书吧。毕竟今年前100姑且看过48本，但感觉很多非新作或者新作里觉得只是平平无奇没特别深印象甚至“我为啥花钱买这本”的就不列了，多数书其实只是原先写的感想抄过来改改，部分觉得有必要的可能会写点感想以外的东西。反正想到哪写到哪，聊的也是和标题一样充满了纯主观的傲慢与偏见的内容，大家就当图一乐好了，如果能真的顺着这篇文章发现可能自己会喜欢的书那就太好了。
关于轻厉和协力者本身的介绍和看法在去年帖子就已经说了，所以这里就讲下今年的变化，一是协力者从去年81人扩容到96人（但去年的协力者有不少今年没续投，毕竟30+的社畜还得肝GBF打原神哪有那么多时间读书，所以通过重新招募补充了30-40人左右的新规），而且协力者的选定标准也第一次披露（年间60册或者日常在当轻小说博主管人就有资格评选），反正协力者本身也只是按照自己的喜好投票的读者，投票结果一如既往会公布，直接买本看看大家投啥就行了。二是web票必须投满5部作品，否则视为无效，造成了有效票从去年的10000票下降到了今年的6000票，不过去年本身就有约1/3票是只投了1部作品的，所以相比去年参与者也不算下降，但必须投5票的确可能导致实际上没读那么多就投点凑数的热门书就是了。废话说完，下面开始按照不分文库单行本的总排名随便写写自己看过的那些书了，如果协力者和WEB进前30了会标注下，我自己投了哪些也会标注（排名微博上有）：

飞机是怎么完成复杂的飞行动作的呢？其实这些高超的飞行表演，都和飞机的超机动性有着密切的关系。那什么是飞机的超机动性呢？
简单来说，我们生活当中开车是在二维空间里进行，而飞机是在三维空间里运动。为了进一步弄清楚超机动性，我们要先了解什么是传统的机动飞行。传统机动飞行主要是指以空气动力为升力所形成的过载完成的曲线运动。而超机动性是在空气动力较弱的区间完成的过失速机动动作。
超机动飞行可在三维空间内完成任意角度、方向的机动飞行。这就要求超机动飞行必须在能量足够的情况下才能完成。普通航空发动机提供的推力方向是固定的，而矢量推力发动机可将推力方向做垂直或水平调整，采用矢量推力用于直接推力，完成飞机的各种复杂机动动作，才能实现超机动飞行。详情点击：

在中国960万平方公里的土地上，口味差异、食材差异、烹饪技术差异，呈现出鲜明的地理适性。所谓“中餐”，很少拥有滋味和外观上的共性，更多时候代表的是基于国家认同下的广泛饮食聚落。但葱油也许是个例外：葱属植物和油脂，这两种滋味、形态、质素有巨大差异的食材，只要到了中国人手中，便成为天作之合：无论是下里巴人的葱油饼、葱油酥、葱油拌面，还是文雅内秀的葱油鸡、葱油肉，又或者是入室登堂的葱油海参、葱油鲥鱼，在加持一勺爆香的葱油之后，都成了地道的中国味儿。孤帆远影碧空尽，举国上下爱葱油。

从植物学的分类看，葱与韭菜、大蒜、薤（藠头）都是同一科的近亲。它们天然富含被称为蒜素或葱素的刺激性成分。实质上，无论蒜素还是葱素，都是由丙烯硫醚、丙烯二硫、硫醇等成分，以不同比例构成的硫化合物。嗅觉敏感的人，常常对啃过葱、嚼过蒜的人避之不及，形容对方“嘴里有屎味”。某种程度上说，这也没错，排泄物的气味里，硫化物也做出了相当贡献。出家人不能吃“五荤“，本质上是认为这些刺鼻的气味影响人的清修。



但奇妙的是，惹人嫌恶的葱素、蒜素，在受热并接触油脂后，会发生脱胎换骨的蜕变。脂肪与硫化物快速分解、结合，成为新的风味物质，脂香四溢、葱味缭绕，这是大多数人都难以拒绝的诱惑。口有同嗜，这种高度契合的食材组合，其实在全球范围内广泛存在。日本人以切碎的大葱搭配味噌汤，依靠大豆和鱼肉…</span>

                    <span>『车田漫画里需要的不是起承转合，如何让读者感到惊讶才是最重要的』
———by 车田正美



这是整个车田宇宙的核心，也是圣斗士成为经典的核心。


也许当年就真吃这套，天马行空的设定比故事本身更受关注。车田这么做了，也确确实实的做到了，打造了一个跨世纪的经典。


车田以他自己那套独创的模式开拓了一片新天地。「开头→叙述→转折→结尾」这种死板的形式，在车田宇宙里可不太常见。


各种荒诞无稽的设定，夸张的必杀，独特的战斗表现集合成所谓的『车田節』。凭借这些独特之处，堆砌了圣斗士世界。



▽
当然，光有核没有精美外壳想必也无法做到风靡世界。其中，星座的实体化无疑是圣斗士成为经典的最重要因素。


在生活中，星座早已成为如同十二生肖般的必然存在。当时，多少朋友通过圣斗士把十二星座倒背如流。


星座通过防具【圣衣】得到实体化。再配上美型男与其搭配，这是男女通杀的妙招，无一幸免。


圣衣的定位本身也是一个亮点，它增大了星座实体化的魅力！



『最初打算用日本武士铠甲型防具，战斗模式就像空手道对决那样。威力过于强大，所以需要穿戴防具。


但感觉普通的防具太土。烦恼之际，脑中突然浮现出希腊神话，觉得把防具做成星座的形状那绝对很酷。


防具定位于西洋风那种带曲线的设计。现在看来狮子座艾欧里亚的黄金圣衣，应该是最接近当初所构思的印象吧』



圣衣效仿西洋风甲胄，但未照搬样式。反倒是削弱了笨重感，进行了更贴身的改良，就像穿戴的服装一样。


动画版中的圣衣设计，更是改良得凸显了美型男的完美身体曲线。这样的视觉冲击，也是促进人气暴涨的重要因素吧。
其中，荒木伸吾与姫野美智的功劳甚大


圣衣根据等级还体现着不同的风格。而这种等级差异，车田直接用对身体的覆盖率，进行了体现。



『当初对圣斗士有个大概的年龄设定。青铜为初中，白银为高中，黄金为大学。对应身高约在165，175，180左右。


另外，圣衣的等级如同军队里的官阶。青铜为尉级，白银为校级，黄金则是将级。


一般印象中，低等兵大都穿戴像作业服那种比较短款的服装，长官级是夹克之类的，而将领级则是长款大衣那种吧。


如此，仅凭穿着就可能判断出级别。当时就是这样考虑的』


圣斗士中青铜最低级，看着也最凉快。白银稍微严实点，黄金则露出更少，神圣衣基本就约等于全身覆盖了。



虽然是防具，但圣衣更像是一种时尚。圣衣的命名『cloth』也算是回应了此特征。


似衣非衣，即使不穿戴圣衣，它依靠着星座本来的造型依然能独立炫酷的存在。这样的设计超级有魅力，即便现在也依旧拉风。


▽
如此独特的设定，没有足够大的空间，想必也难以展现出它全部的魅力。


圣斗士宏大的世界观，就为圣衣提供了一个完现魅力的『时尚平台』。圣衣在无形中仿佛拉近了传说与现实的距离。



车田用一个『超』字把众多神话串联起，所有神话被归纳成同宗。各家神话在圣斗士世界里就相当于从宗家衍生出的支派。


但在未普及互联网，信息较闭塞的当时也很难能了解到这部分内容。


而圣斗士的历史背景，其尺度远比当时所理解的要大得多得多，被称之为『大圣战史』。


》宇宙的诞生
》生命的诞生
》雅典娜的诞生
》波塞冬的初次圣战，圣斗士与圣衣诞生
》巨人族之战
》阿瑞斯的圣战
》and so on………


在正篇开始之前，还有这么一大段迷一般的历史存在。这一切在作品中基本都未提及，而是记载于此刊物中。



当了解到这一大段历史后，有种圣斗士的尺度又被放大了一倍的感觉。就是在这样一个大世界里，光芒万丈的圣衣照亮着每个角落。
《圣斗士星矢》中的众神体系是怎么样的？

比起圣斗士的世界观，它的故事则显得要简单得多。但依靠这来自独特灵感的设计，依旧让此作如凤凰烈火般火红。


因为车田一直致力于让观众感受到震撼！


他破天荒的才能，对当时的观众来说也许是恰到好处。仿佛是艾欧洛斯附身，用暗影之箭束缚了世界各地观众的心。


时代在变，那份情怀却难以忘怀。那句口号依旧响彻云霄，被喊出了跨世纪的经典：


燃えろ、俺のコスモよ！

大学当然是用来探索、成长和改变的，但是年轻有一个弊端，就是常常回不经意走入歧途。
像我的人生是个典型的弯路合集，选错了专业，多花一年本科毕业。从错误的方法减肥，还好年轻没留下毛病。尝试了很多完全不适合自己的造型，幸好都在我做自媒体之前。
说到形象管理我真的想提醒各位妹妹，大学里很自由但也有很多杂音。特别是当你解锁屏幕打开大门，看到的都是大家对某种潮流趋之若鹜的时候，就要多问问自己：这么做是为了自己好，还是为了迎合大众的眼光。
但真正喜欢你的人关心的是你是不是健康舒服，不管你什么样子他总会在你的身上看到光芒，会温和的提醒你的错误、陪伴着你成长。只有喜欢面子的人才会不管不顾得要自己的女朋友24小时光鲜亮丽。

                    <span>答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。
首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。
再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。
其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。
比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。

例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。
举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……
说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。

普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。
当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   
那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？

答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

                    <span>Next.js is a React framework that provides a lot of useful features out of the box. One of these powerful features is API routes, which allows you to make an API/backend entirely within your Next.js application.
// pages/api/hello.js
//   requests to /api/hello return {&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Hello, World!&quot;}
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: &#x27;Hello, World&#x27; })
}

Services like Vercel and Netlify manage your API routes in a serverless environment, meaning you get a very scalable API and your code can be deployed globally. 
In this post, we&#x27;ll create an authenticated API route that looks like this:
// pages/api/whoami.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // check if the request contains a valid token
    await requireUser(req, res)

                    <span>I often find myself in the need of a very basic open/close transition in React for components like dialogs, side sheets, or dropdowns. The goto solution for a while seemed to be React Transition Group, which I never understood how to use properly. An excellent solution for animations is react-spring, but I&#x27;d consider it an overkill for a basic CSS powered open/close transition (but it&#x27;s great for animations in something like an image viewer).
This is why I’ve ended up writing my own hook: react-css-transition-hook
It is used like this:
const { isOpen } &#x3D; useMenu();
const [isVisible, props] &#x3D; useTransition(isOpen, {
  entering: &quot;transition ease-out duration-100 transform opacity-0 scale-95&quot;,

                    <span>TLDR


Accuracy tells you how many times the ML model was correct overall. Precision is how good the model is at predicting a specific category. Recall tells you how many times the model was able to detect a specific category.
Introduction
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
How to determine if your model is doing well
When to use precision or recall
Conclusion
Most machine learning (ML) problems fit into 2 groups: classification and regression. The main metrics used to assess performance of classification models are accuracy, precision, and recall.

To demonstrate each of these metrics, we’ll use the following example: We’re a mage on a quest to save the villagers from a horde of monsters. There are 100 monsters attacking the village. We’re going to use machine learning to pr…</span>

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss some patterns for organizing a global state in a React application.
Writing about how to organize global state implies that there is such a thing as disorganized state. Truth be told, there are several issues that can spring up from an unorganized, unprincipled global state.
As a basic example, the global state may contain a response payload from an API request, and it may contain some UI state about whether certain components are visible. These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.
When these distinctions aren&#x27;t made, you can run into trouble. For example, if you create a top-level property for every screen/experience, you can duplicate the storage of the API responses that support those experiences:

                    <span>Google Analytics can provide a lot of insight into traffic and about users visiting your website. A lot of this data is available in nice format in web console, but what if you wanted to build your own diagrams and visualizations, process the data further or just generally work with it programmatically? That&#x27;s where Google Analytics API can help you, and in this article we will look at how you can use it to query and process realtime analytics data with Python.
Before jumping into using some specific Google API, it might be a good idea to first play around with some of them. Using Google&#x27;s API explorer, you can find out which API will be most useful for you, and it will also help you determine which API to enable in Google Cloud console.

PostgreSQL v14 was recently released with some major improvements. Some of these improvements include enhancements for heavy workload performance, improved support for distributed workload, and security enhancements.
One of the most exciting releases is enhanced support for JSON, which will be the focus of this blog post.
Before we delve into these improvements, let’s get a good understanding of how JSON has been used in PostgreSQL. This will help us to appreciate the improvements better.
JSON was first introduced in Postgres with its v9.2 release. While it was a very exciting development, its implementation was not perfect. Postgres basically validated that the JSON to be stored is valid JSON and stored it as a text string.

The coverage badges are generated with the cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator, which I have been developing and maintaining for a while now.

                    <span>DynamoDB (DDB) is a compelling datastore choice for Serverless developers for a few key reasons. Dynamo offers a HTTP API, IAM Authorization, serverless pay-per-use billing, and almost unlimited scale when used properly. But there&#x27;s more to DynamoDB than a convenient way to store and fetch data for Lambda users.
If you&#x27;re new to DynamoDB and Serverless, you may not yet have come across DynamoDB Streams yet. Perhaps you have, but are a bit unclear on how to apply them to your applications. Like the OP of this twitter thread, the compelling use cases for DynamoDB Streams may not be clear to you.

                    <span>During my time as a developer I&#x27;ve created a lot of &quot;typed&quot; code. One particular issue has come up repeatedly and I finally had a moment of clarity.
Whenever I write something like this ...
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType; // ERROR HERE
  [key: string]: string;
}

... I get the following error on the commented line above.
Property &#x27;config&#x27; of type &#x27;ConfigType&#x27; is not assignable to &#x27;string&#x27; index type &#x27;string&#x27;.
The issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.
I&#x27;ve seen something like the following ...
export interface Person {
  id: number;
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
  [key: string]: string | number;
}

... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.
I came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.
This approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export type DataModel &#x3D; {
  config: ConfigType;
} &amp; {
  [key: string]: string;
};

The following code is another resolution.
export interface ConfigType {
  type: string;
}

export interface DataModel {
  config: ConfigType;
  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;
}

This approach has the &quot;issue&quot; that a new &quot;key&quot; could be used with another ConfigType.
As I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.
If anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.</span>

Wallpaper Engine：万众期待的动态壁纸引擎上线 Android 版

平台：Android / Windows
关键词：壁纸、动态壁纸

@Noah_Choi：想必各位玩家的 Steam 库中一定会有 Wallpaper Engine 这个强大的动态壁纸工具，它帮无数玩家美化了自己的电脑桌面、营造了一个或炫酷或可爱的娱乐氛围。不过话说回来，动态壁纸可是 Android 平台的强项，所以在近日，Wallpaper Engine 发布了 Android 版本，我们手里的手机或者平板电脑也能享受到创意工坊里无穷无尽的动态壁纸了。
使用 Wallpaper Engine 的 Android 版非常简单，它直接使用了 Android 系统动态壁纸接口，我们可以在壁纸设置中找到 Wallpaper Engine 服务，或者通过应用内设置壁纸。Wallpaper Engine 已经内置了 9 款基础壁纸，可以看作是一个基础功能展示。每种壁纸都会有一些自定义选项，例如修改配色、元素选择等等，在电脑上使用过 Wallpaper Engi…</span>

编注：如无特殊说明，以下日历产品可以直接在电商平台搜索和购买。
同福客栈日历 2022
几乎每隔一段时间，我都能听到不同的朋友说又开始重刷《武林外传》了。作为国民下饭神剧，《武林外传》的周边产业也是风生水起、热热闹闹。从原声播客到搞笑博主，应有尽有。同福客栈 2022 日历就是由 @同福客栈知识竞答 推出的。

《同福客栈2022日历》在每一天都精选了一句剧中台词，光看这文字就有画面了，难怪自称「有声日历」。所选取的句子都与当天的日期有所关联，至于到底是什么样的联系，我看必须得是《武林外传》五级学者才能真正发掘出其中的奥妙。

除了台词之外，每页日历底下还有一道知识考验。出题点都是来自剧中不起眼的一点剧情，比如「西铺米街被盗几捆大葱？」，等等…… 我竟然都不知道有西铺米街的存在？！

《同福客栈2022日历》日历页包含阴历阳历、以及星期和节假日，可以说是非常齐全了。全彩插图避开了剧中的人物与场景，不过配色鲜艳丰富，也是来自同福客栈里的各种颜色。

你可以在店铺 同福客栈知识竞答 购买《同福客栈2022日历》售价 98 元。
五金行日历 2022
中断一年后，品牌设计公司 Five Metal Shop 总算是推出《五金行日历 2022》了。

《五金行日历 2022》沿用了一如即往的高级设计。这本日历最与众不同的便是采用了大量鲜艳的配色，来自 10 种全新Pantone 颜色，包含五种霓虹色、两种金属色、两种特殊色和一种粉彩色。

它们有夜市闪烁的霓虹紫、盥洗台上的牙膏粉绿、年节餐桌上的乌鱼子红、每天追着跑的垃圾车黄。受到这些来…</span>

                    <span>前言
不知道你有没有设想过，躺在沙发上就能让卧室的电脑帮你下载想看的电影、说一句话就能让电脑打开想玩的游戏……这些看似「科幻」的操作，在智能家庭逐渐普及的当下，显然已经不是什么难事了。
不过，依赖第三方解决方案往往很难满足自身的所有需求。以我自己为例，我的 PC 作为家用游戏机，一直连接在电视上。想舒服的进行遥控，要么使用无线键鼠，要么使用远程桌面，终归费时费力。无意瞄到桌面摆放的 HomePod，开始思考能不能使用语音去进行遥控。呀，用语音进行控制 Windows 电脑，好像是个很酷的事情耶～
想到就做，但想法是美好的，事实是残酷的。就这样一个简单的需求，局限于设备平台以及系统权限，需要付出大量心血才能实现。愿意折腾的玩家或许会享受这个过程，但作为普通人的我们，就想简单快速的满足自己，那有没有好方案呢？
有的，而且很简单。下面请允许我将这个「魔法」剖析给你，助你成为家里的魔术师🪄

                    <span>Matrix 首页推荐
Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

过去的我并不认为一个足够安静的写作环境能为自己带来效率的提升——这个想法一直持续到我开始在少数派写作，然后就没有然后了。在少数派发文两个月，我逐渐意识到在写作过程中排除干扰对于保持思考的重要性。所谓「灵感」只不过是个一闪而过的念头，而抓住这个念头的难度并不比在热门视频中精准定位到一条弹幕要更容易一点——视频可以回退和暂停到进度条的任何位置，但人的想法却没有「精确回溯」这一说。既然主观上无法作为，想要更加容易的捕捉灵感，就得从客观条件的方向着手改善：在来自外界的无数干扰中，最容易被消除的当属无休止的环境噪音；而至于那些内在的杂乱想法，就只得「时时勤拂拭，勿使惹尘埃」了。
抱着如此的想法，我开始在市面上寻找一款能够满足长时专注需求的无线消噪耳机。在此之前，我曾经使用过 FreeBuds 3 及 AirPods Pro——前者在佩戴的体验上显得轻松愉快，但消噪功能的作用范围比较有限；后者的消噪效果处于该品类的第一梯队，然其悬挂入耳的设计依然会让我在使用超过三十分钟后明显感觉到耳道的「力不从心」——即使使用最小的硅胶耳塞时也不例外。当下无线消噪耳机的出货主力都是些有一定技术实力的手机厂商，这些优先适配自家硬件设备和软件生态的产品自然也会受到各种各样意想不到的限制和约束 除了 AirPods Pro 不支持 Apple Music 的无损音频，所以我将眼光投向了传统声学厂商推出的同类产品，这其中恰好有一款产品满足了我对于无线消噪耳机的全部期待——Bose QuietComfort Earbuds，通俗一点的名称则是「Bose 大鲨」。

央行解读收款二维码新规
据新华社报道，央行有关人士近日就上月发布的《中国人民银行关于加强支付受理终端及相关业务管理的通知》进行解读，针对「微信、支付宝收款码将不能用于经营收款」的说法做出澄清。该通知的主要内容之一是将条码支付纳入监管范围，对个人收款条码的使用规范做出具体规定，并将于 2022 年 3 月 1 日起施行。
根据央行说法，上述规定的背景是，此前一些商户收款使用「码牌」或者打印封装的二维码，此类「个人静态收款条码」收款安全性较低，容易被犯罪分子利用，因此要求向收款服务机构（如微信、支付宝等）申请转为商用收款码；同时，要求不得通过个人收款条码为具有明显经营活动特征的个人提供经营活动相关收款服务。
至于哪些用户属于「具有明显经营特征」，中国支付清算协会正在研究制定相关标准。人民银行有关人士表示，在相关要求实施之前，支付服务机构必须要全面、充分评估客户正常支付需求，制定配套服务解决方案，确保服务成本不升、服务质量不降。收款服务机构有义务免费为商户提供商用收款码，商户只需要提供必要的身份核实信息。来源

                    <span>汽车安全座椅在小朋友的眼中，也许是这样的：

其实在1940年前后，一小部分有车家庭就开始使用了。但如果我跟你说，当时的画风是这样的，你还敢坐嘛？

是的，那个时候它的长相和功能和现在相距甚远。严格来说还称不上是一个“安全座椅”，最多算是“汽车座椅”。

如果回到那个时代生活，我宁愿孩子们都不要坐它！因为那个时候的汽车座椅并非现在的「免死金牌」，而是一个不折不扣、骇人听闻的「儿童杀手」。
下面我就用多图来带大家看看，儿童汽车安全座椅有着怎样令人深感震撼的的百年曲折发展史。
❤️ 阶段一：座椅？打包带！
1. 啼笑皆非的早期原型
上世纪30年代能开上车的，那可真不是一般人，人们普遍认为，巨大坚硬、风雨无阻的汽车本身就是最厉害的。
当时的克莱斯勒汽车广告上俨然写着： 
 “亲爱的爸爸，你看我在100公里每小时（60迈/小时）的车上还能写字哎。” 
“是的儿子，我们现在乘坐的就是无坚不摧的钢铁大桥号。”
而且无论大人小孩，一律没有安全保护措施。

这在今天就是典型的反面教材，但那时候人们的交通安全意识基本为零。当时的汽车就算有任何安全设施，也完全不是从乘客的健全和舒适角度出发，而是为了驾驶者的方便。
比如，Bunny Bear公司在1933年发明的第一台儿童汽车座椅，只需要用绑绳捆在座位上。娃坐的高了、看得远了，注意力被转移了。大人开车也就不容易被打扰了。

到了40-60年代，家长可以花1-5刀买一个更加便携轻便的可折叠座椅。
它通常是像下面这样，用铁架子加帆布、麻布、塑料板或木箱做成的。靠两个铁钩子挂在座位靠背上，酷似一个“带钩子的内裤”。

单看乘坐的部分有点像如今的跳跳椅。不过从结构上更像一个吹风机挂篮的放大版。随意程度简直令人怀疑历史。

还有的人为了进一步增加娱乐效果，让孩子站在车座上模仿大人开车。
我们大概不需要通过撞击模拟实验也可以猜出，当意外发生时，这种挂钩座椅…</span>

                    <span>相信绝大多数职场人在平时的工作中，免不了需要参与各种规模、各种性质的会议，有团队内部的、团队之间的、跨职能、向上级汇报工作等等，如何在这些会议中能够游刃有余的有效发言，这是每一个职场人都要学的一门学问，其中很有讲究
这里对会议发言上常见的问题进行一个归类，看是否有遇到过类似经历

想说却不敢说
对 topic 不是很了解，跟不上讨论的节奏，没有办法发言，或者在场的人比较多，有一些资深的或者气场比较强的人存在，此时轮到自己发言时会语无伦次，语言能力急剧下降
敢说却不会说
发言经常被打断，等你阐述完自己的观点后，没有人对你的发言回应直接进入后面的环节或者全场雅雀没有正面或负面的反馈，试图对自己的观点补充几次后，反而自己说的重点没有了
敢说也知道怎么说，犹豫该不该讲
这种经常发生在跟上级汇报工作的场景，有的时候上司会因为缺少一些上下文，问的问题或发表的评论不一定在点子上，此时资历比较浅的人会努力的去迎合、回答解释，而不是当面指出，以此避免正面的冲突，害怕对方下不来台

要解决这些问题，首先需要明确开会的意义，以及在开会时有效发言的意义
根据会议不同的目的，可以将其分为如下 3 类：

日常例会，此类会议的主旨是在团队内同步各项目的进展，目的是找到影响工作进程的阻碍项，通过调整后续策略，以此提高团队整体执行效率
为了做某项决定而开的会，解决一些矛盾的观点，这种会议中会有不同意见直接的碰撞，目的是在会议结束时，能够让与会人都能同意某一种决定做法
征询意见的会议，集思广益来提高负责人实施方案的质量，比如在互联网公司常见的技术评审 review

会议中发言的重要性
常常听到有同学说是为了刷「存在感」，这个可能有一些片面，从侧面也反映出自身在职业发展上还没有找到突破口和契机

首先开会是一个自我学习的途径，在会议中，需要保持自己听懂或者同意会议所做的决定，这会直接影响到自己平时的工作，如…</span>

                    <span>前两天看到了网上流传的清朝的微积分课本中的几页，其中的所有数学表达式都是用中文书写的。虽然整个过程不忍直视，但还是感觉蛮有趣的。于是我打算写篇文章翻译一下这几页。[1][2]
下面我们先来看到第一页：
第一页
请您上眼。乍一看大家肯定觉得：这都啥啊？这样的公式好丑，怎么能记得住呢？而且这里面居然还有完全不认识的字？比如一个双人旁一个天念啥？
下面我就要使用魔法将这些丑丑的公式翻译成能看的懂的形式了。
在翻译之前，我们要明确的一个 大原则 是：在清朝，“分数”的“分子”是分母，“分母”是分子 。也就是说，如果看到“分数”，则我们取它的倒数就可以得到现代意义下的分数 。
提示：这条大原则全文适用 。
首先映入眼帘的是：
 
这明显是一个函数，它翻译成英语就是：
 
啊，看着舒服多啦～这道例题提到了“...求其微分之式，则可依blabla...”。害，无所谓依啥了，我们自己就可以搞定。求  这个函数的微分函数比较容易的。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
与：

做比较可以得到以下破译密码：

双人旁  
一  
长得像垂直符号的符号  
訥  

第一个公式的破译工作就完成啦～很顺利是不是！但是，下一个公式就很难破译了。没错，就是它：

这个公式，堪称我破译工作中最可(**)爱(**)的一个。先不管天啊，地啊啥的。从刚才的破译密码中我们得知的信息是 双人旁  ，于是问题就出现了这里面有  ，  以及  。咦？这么快就跳到全微分啦？但仔细不看不对啊，这跟全微分完全不沾边啊。于是我推测，这不是全微分，而是刚才例题的推广，因为我在下面的结果中看到了天的地次方：  ：

此处的天和地不能再理解为  和  了，而是应该理解为  与  ，说白了，就是对函数：
 
求导（ 这个表达简直了。。。哈哈哈哈哈哈哈）。
像破译第一个公式一样，这里我们如法炮制即可。首先将  改写一下：
 
进而成立：
 
即：
 
将式  进一步化简可得：
 
现在我们将  除到左边之后与之前所提到的 大原则 一起可得：
 
将式  与：

做比较可得：

戍  
天/地  

这样第一页我们就完全破译啦！下面开始第二页的破译～
第二页
这一页的破译工作会异常轻松。首先我们看到了“积分”这个字眼，并且他说“啥啥（就是那个怪怪的公式），要必为简式”才可求其积分。所以我们不妨先来看看：

这是个啥？
由之前所总结的破译密码可知，天一定代表一个“变量”。而且我们还知道长得像垂直符号的那个符号等价于加法，因此我们推测：

长得像转置符号的那个符号  

而甲，乙，丙...啥的自然表示的就是常数  等等。至于寅卯午巳这些字，如果你愿意，可以定义为  等等，它们也都表示常数。因此，我们可以将其破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
同理，我们可以将：

破译为（指数上注意 大原则 ）：
 
聪明的你一定发现了：

表达的就是不定积分的分部积分法：
 
破译密码为：

禾  
戌/亥  

最后是第三页：
第三页
有了之前两页的经验，相信这一页大家一定得心应手啦。在这一页中，所有的汉字数字与阿拉伯数字的含义是一致的。而天，地，人（这应该是人吧）表示的都是变量。因此我们可以设：
 
因此：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
而：

表示（注意 大原则 ）：
 
显然，式  是式  的一个原函数。而丙上面加一个点表示的是积分常数  ，与普通的丙表示的  是不一样的（二丙，看起来像麻将）。
现在让我们看到最右边的：

这表示的显然是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
我一度认为左边是二阶导数。。。后来一想不对，如果是二阶导数的话“分母”上的二应该在双人旁后面。因此：

表示的是（注意 大原则 ）：
 
然后后面说可以将  ，进而：

表示的就是（注意 大原则 ）：

                    <span>It&#x27;s in the name, duh. But, what does it actually mean? In a nutshell, you code everyday for at least an hour and document everything that you learnt. It&#x27;s from the 100DaysOfCode website.

As the rules suggest, I&#x27;ll code for at least one hour everyday and share my status on social media. This will also act as a timeline blog of my journey as a Web Developer.

在北京待了差不多半年，本想写北京，但其实细想，我似乎很难在北京找到一种放松的感觉。胡同的静是属于游客和大爷的，很难属于在这个城市工作的外来者。咖啡吧和下午茶是精致的悠闲，按摩不了紧绷的神经，长居城市的我们，偶尔也需要离开社交层面的部分自我，与自然进行一次近距离对话。
此外，漫步北京也许是容易的，漫步国庆却不是那么简单。于是我和朋友们选择在国庆「出逃」北京，途沿火山和草原，一路向西，到鄂尔多斯的沙漠折返，经过呼和浩特和山西大同，最终回到北京，在北京的西边画一个圈。
在北京的西边画一个圈
前期准备：自驾+住宿
越往城市边缘走，路上的风景就越多样，相比其他出行方式，自驾也许最合适来「走西口」
对比了各类租车软件后，我们最终选定在「神舟租车」上租一辆「宝沃BX5」。国庆五天的价格大概在 2640 元，平分到我们 4 个人大概是 660 元/人。这是国庆的价格，我看了一下大概在平常日价格的 3 倍以上，如果多人一起在平常日子里出游那真是很香了。
自驾过程中总共加了 2 次油，总价算到个人大概是 100+。这里要提醒大家的是，最后还车的时候记得一定要去加油站加满油，不然平台会扣除格外 100 元加油服务费。

住房上，我们有三晚住的是平常的旅店，另外一晚住的是蒙古包，都是两个人一间。出乎意料，最后每个人每天在住宿上花的价格大概在 100 元左右。下面是住宿的支出合计：

10.2 北京-草原天路-乌兰察布
10 点出发-下午经草原天路（桦皮林东入口-野狐岭出口）往乌兰察布-十点到达白影察干镇

革命不是请客吃饭、不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致、那样从容不迫。
但并不是所有的沃尔夫斯堡人都有这样的觉悟，他们抗拒这样的现实，所以坚定的改革派、大众集团 CEO Herbert Diess 又一次处在漩涡中心。
根据路透社消息，大众工会主席 Daniela Cavallo、大股东皮耶希、保时捷家族的代表，会在周二举办的监事会执行委员会议上讨论 Diess 的去留问题，并在 12 月 9 日前做出最后决定。这场危机距离 Diess 获得工作合同延长，雄心勃勃地发布 2030「NEW AUTO」战略，赢得改革的阶段性胜利仅仅过了 4 个月。

对于大众这种级别的巨人，大变革下的转身必然阵痛，注定不会平静。
百年未有之变局
2021 年是智能电动车继续狂飙突进的一年。国内市场新能源渗透在 9 月历史性地突破了 20%，而距离上一次突破新能源渗透率的历史性门槛「10%」，仅仅相差 5 个月。站在这波历史性的风口上，国内造车新势力三强「蔚小理」先后突破十万辆大关，0 到 1 的蜕变已经完成，并开始把触手伸向大众的欧洲大本营。

特斯拉一骑绝尘，上海工厂产能拉满，将弹药源源不断地输送到中国和欧洲市场，万亿美元的市值高过丰田、大众、通用等十余家传统车企之和。掌舵着财大气粗的大众集团，Diess 也不禁感叹，「特斯拉因为其高估值，可以无限地获得资金和资源。」
当然，大众已经是传统车企中转型电动化最积极的那一个，纯电品台 MEB 的 ID. 家族产品已经打向中欧美三大市场。Diess 可以在内部讲话中安抚大众员工，在中国，他们的电动产品第三季度销量比…</span>

                    <span>大家好，万维猫的老王又来啦。嗯，到这集为止，年番的第一个小副本结束了，也按照之前约定的，和大家聊聊这次年番剧本创作的一些想法。
矿场篇的五集在年番中属于比较短的段落篇幅，优点是铺垫不用很长，该收的线很容易收回来，节奏也会比较紧凑。从燕家堡特别篇开始全面接手导演和编剧工作以来，我就在思考和试验，真人风格的动画表现形式，对于节奏的要求显然比电视剧要快，但又不能一味的快，人物刻画和情绪渲染也很重要。所以我们会在年番中更注重人物的复杂性。比如这一集里给陈师姐加的这种欲言又止的情感，还有之前给宣乐赋予的理想主义瞬间，其实又何尝不是给韩立增加了一些情绪的锚点。
很多人物，如果你不看他，他可能就是个路人，但略微驻足，就能看到他们身上的种种线索思绪。正如出现在我们生命里的每个看似不经意的相遇，都会给我们带来无限的可能。所谓一期一会，见众生如见己，就是如此。
凡人的整体基调不能说是欢快的，终其一生，韩立都是过客，不是归人。他所探寻的，既是未知的尽头，也是存在的意义。当然，过程中的升级舔包这些喜闻乐见之事也可成为短暂的快乐源泉，但此行漫漫不知所终的未知与伤情，还有那些必将来到却无法改变的离别，才是韩立日复一日需要面对的大道无情，这与我们的一生又何其相似。
也许这就是为何很多纪元以后，身在仙界的韩天尊，还会偶然想起那个在天南山间乘舟凌水而行的黄昏，还有那盛开在漫山遍野的白色野菊花。

                    <span>In this article, we will install and configure a Next.js project, including:
Adding SASS / SCSS support
Setting up Eslint and Prettier
Setting up Eslint to run automatically before every commit (via a Git hook)
Setting up Semantic Commits (via a Git hook)
Any of the above items are optional and can be skipped during the process. For example, if you are not familiar with Semantic Commits or do not plan to use it, you can skip that part and move on to another.
You may want to bookmark this article and use it as a reference when creating your projects. I will try to keep it up to date, and when I discover a new useful feature, I will include it here.
Let&#x27;s get started.
We need Node.js 12.22.0 or later in order to install and use Next.js.

Common data types you&#x27;ll encounter are numbers like 34313, strings of text like &quot;words for the win&quot;, arrays for when you want a collection of items, null/nil for representing nothing at all, and objects/structs/classes for when you&#x27;re composing together possibly many different pieces of data to represent something, like details about a car or a user account on a website.
And a difference between the many programming languages you can choose from, is that they have different sets of rules for how you work with different data types. Those rules, are called type systems, or typing d…</span>

                    <span>Today, I had time to do some coding 🧑🏼‍💻 😀
I started my Saturday early, with a 6am presentation (my time) to one of our Twitter Developer Communities, in India. It was a fun run through of what’s available in the brand new version of the Twitter API, with a live demo using our Postman Collection 💻 I also took some really great questions from the folks in the live stream, so I appreciated the opportunity.
@andypiper

      
After that (and, several cups of ☕), I thought I’d have a play with something that caught my eye a couple of weeks ago - the new Glitch in Bio starter template from the great folks over at Glitch. I&#x27;d seen the news about it, and the follow-up post about the generated sites being Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and I had been keen to have a play for a few days... but Re…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s hard to maintain a state. Harder to maintain a UI. And near impossible to keep a user happy.
No matter how well you plan, disintegration always happens.
React is a well-known web UI library with a long history of state implementation. Components shape the application. But it&#x27;s a state&#x27;s job to keep it inside the sanity borders.
That is unless it drives the developer insane before achieving this goal!
We know how the seasons pass. In spring, flowers bloom. In summer, sweats run down the armpits. With autumn, leaves leave the branches. And who will forget the snowy days of winter? (Hint: People who live after global warming makes its debut!)

                    <span>Polar charts often look impressive, which makes some people think that creating them is a tricky process demanding plenty of skills and expertise. Well, I am going to debunk this myth right now! Let me show you how to easily visualize data in a beautiful interactive JavaScript Polar Chart.
Fundamentally, a polar chart is a variation of a circular graph drawn with polar coordinates. It can also work well to visualize some sorts of categorical data for comparisons, which is exactly the case I want to demonstrate now. In this tutorial, I will build a column polar chart, with the bars growing from the center of the diagram to represent values with their length.

                    <span>Time for some regular expressions! Just like with the CSS episode, we won&#x27;t use them for intended purpose, we&#x27;ll use them for programming!
Technically I&#x27;ll count this as a Sed episode.
Sed is a very simple limited-purpose programming language which supports regular expressions and some really few other things. A sed script, usually a shell one-liner, is run separately on every line of input. It&#x27;s still used in many shell scripts where one command produces some text, then sed reshuffles it a bit with regular expressions, then another command consumes it.
I don&#x27;t really approve of this style of programming, and I think you&#x27;re better off using proper script in Ruby, Python, or Perl pretty much every single scenario - it will be much clearer, actually testable, and very often more concise as w…</span>

                    <span>Javascript always has some surprises in store. for example, typeof [] return object and not array. This has historical reasons. But this can be very confusing
How can you then properly check if something is an array?
For example, you could check if the constructor is an array.
([]).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
(new Array).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
({}).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(true).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // false
(null).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError
(undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // TypeError

As you can see this has a problem. With null and undefined a TypeError is thrown. 
You could catch this for example with a try/catch.
try {
  (undefined).constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Array // true
} catch(e) {
}

But you don&#x27;t want that.
There is also this exotic possibility to check if it is …</span>

                    <span>If the C: drive is running out of space, we can move our WSL2 file system to another drive in a few steps.
If we are using an user different than root, we need to know it, running the whoami command (WSL side):

Also we need to know the distro name and WSL version, running the wsl --list --verbose command on PowerShell (Windows Side):

Knowing the username: equiman, the linux distribution: Ubuntu, and confirm that we are using the WSL 2 version, we are ready to...

All next steep need to be done on PowerShell (Windows Side).
First we need to shutdown WSL to avoid data corruption. Close all WSL terminals that are using it and then run the wsl --shutdown command.
Next we are going to create a backup from our Ubuntu linux distribution.
mkdir D:\backup
wsl --export Ubuntu D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

Don&#x27;t worry if you not see progress indicators. This can be take a while depending how much data you have. Maybe it&#x27;s good idea take a rest.

When finish, we need to to unregister the linux distribution from C: drive. It will also release the disk space.
wsl --unregister Ubuntu

And then, import again on our new disk. I&#x27;ll use D: disk as an example.
mkdir D:\WSL
wsl --import Ubuntu D:\WSL\ D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

By default Ubuntu will use root as default user, to switch to our user (equiman in my case) we need to run this commands.
cd $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
ubuntu config --default-user equiman

Ensure replacing equiman with yours.
Restart WSL running wsl command and it&#x27;s done.
That’s All Folks!
Happy Coding 🖖</span>

                    <span>今年称得上是「游戏小年」，这点想必喜欢玩游戏的读者们都有同感；从去年同期到现在，整个业界尚未拿出一款投入高质量强，既叫好又叫座的高水平作品。那几款玩家们盼望已久的超级大作，发售后却接连遭遇口碑上的滑铁卢；而更多让人翘首以待的作品，全都抢着把发售档期排到了 2022 年。
不过，虽然超大型制作没能带来亮眼表现，但今年值得一玩的作品并不少。它们要么内容扎实，可以支撑你玩上很长一段时间；要么有着独特的创意和新奇的玩法，能让你体验到特别的乐趣。
每年的这个时候，都是游戏厂商们疯狂打折促销的日子，各个平台也会推出主题促销活动；有意思的是，今年 Steam 的秋季特卖还比之前延长了 1 天，12 月 1 日才会结束。
这次我们也为大家整理了一些值得入手的史低游戏，不妨趁着「黑五」特惠，用便宜的价格买下几款心仪的作品；在为今年划上圆满句号的同时，也能用一颗充满期待的心去迎接未来。
注意：不同平台的折扣截止日期不一致，具体详情请以对应平台的商店页面信息为准。
双人成行

想必这会是很多人心中的年度最佳作品之一，它拥有充满天马行空般想象力的关卡设计，以及令人眼花缭乱的各式玩法；而无论小游戏还是 Boss 战，它也充分利用了二人协作的机制，没有将这一卖点流于纸面。
本作在 Steam、Xbox 和 PS 平台上皆有折扣，支持本地双人同屏或者联网游戏。值得一提的是，第二个玩家通过「好友通行证」即可和你一同畅玩，不需要买两份。
此外，你也可以通过办理 EA Play 玩到本作。

前言
如今市面上笔记类或者知识管理类软件太多，甚至每个月都能看见一款新产品的上线。工具本身并没有优劣，它们只是反映了工具使用者的需求和工作流。虽然不应该舍本逐末般沉迷于工具本身的研究，但依然不妨碍我们去探索和寻找新的工具来完善自己的信息管理。
今年年初的时候，我偶然间知道了 Anytype 这款知识管理软件，瞬间被它的「本地化 Notion」的用户评价所吸引，于是立即填写 表格，加入 Anytype 的测试计划。
Anytype 目前可以填写申请表格，每个月大概40-50人
六月份的时候，我收到了测试邀请（onboarding program），但是由于时差的缘故没法参加在线介绍。当我在十一月收到新的测试邀请时，没有丝毫地犹豫就加入了。
来自 Anytype 工程师的邀请邮件
在产品说明会议里，CEO Zhanna Sharipova 简单介绍了 Anytype 的发展路径、当前主要功能以及未来愿景，工程师 Enda Crowley 实时展示了一些基本操作。
产品介绍 Zoom 会议（Onboarding Session）
会议结束之后，Enda 立即发送了 Anytype 的下载和对应社区邀请链接。有趣的是，本周Anytype 又推出了 iOS 测试版本。截至 2021 年 11 月，Anytype 目前支持桌面端有 MacOS、Windows 以及 Linux，移动平台有 Android 以及 iOS。

If he dies, his world is deleted. Will he survive? Yea,  because he probably wouldn&#x27;t upload the video if he didn&#x27;t. Enjoy and stay notable!

                    <span>One way is using function parameter and another way is using extension function.
There could be more than 2 ways to implement binding adapters, but this is what I know. Let&#x27;s look at what binding adapters are first.
Binding adapter is used for implementing custom attribute in your layout file. For example, instead of using the defaultandroid:text attribute, you want to customize it by creating a new attribute app:customText.

                    <span>Introduction


Software engineering is a field that is regularly changing. Thus, developers must be continual learners to stay sharp.
However, motivating yourself to learn and creating a lasting habit can be difficult, especially if you&#x27;re self-studying outside of school or work.  Below are four techniques that I use to stay motivated while learning.
Set deadlines
Gamify
Spice it up
Identify the end goal
Learning without structure can feel like an endless task with no end in sight; it&#x27;s often nice to have a sense of progress. I&#x27;ve found that artificial deadlines give me something to work toward and cleanly mark progress.
Here are some examples of deadlines you could set for yourself:
I will study Python for 30 minutes by the end of the day
I will complete one module of my online JavaScript…</span>

                    <span>We all want to see a return on our investment, especially when creating applications, which require significant resources.
You spent money, your time, put in a lot of effort, and finally, your app is ready. Now comes the new challenge: what to charge for your app?
The decision depends on many factors. The number of working hours, testing costs, marketing and promotion, purchase of any licenses are some aspects that define the overall cost of development. Calculate the costs first, then set the price for the app.
To put an adequate price tag on your product, first, let&#x27;s look at the different pricing models.
Understanding the pros and cons of pricing models will help you choose the best option for you.
It is essential to find the balance between the price that customers are ready to pay and…</span>

                    <span>Context


Our company has organized &quot;Secret Santa&quot;, pre-covid times. I got the name of a nerdy colleague and a friend. I decided to gift him Amazon gift coupon. Like people usually do - hiding gift somewhere in desk, I instead created an online puzzle like a treasure hunt using some automation. If he solves he will receive gift on his email.
Printed a bar code on a paper and put it on my friend&#x27;s workstation desk. Upon scanning, it redirects to a simple website I&#x27;ve created using wixsite.com.
Here&#x27;s the picture of printed barcode along with other gifts -


The landing page shows following instruction -
 
To get your gift all you need is an email address.
Before I tell you more, why don&#x27;t you give a try yourself to find the email address? Here&#x27;s the link after scanning barcode - https://turantsephele.wixsite.com/giftgenerator

Once you click &quot;Get email address&quot;, it redirects you to another page which shows a timer and nothing else. And with a small hidden button somewhere in page.
If you are able to find the button and click, it redirects you to brainfuck visualizer with some pre-populated code. 
I&#x27;ve written this code in brainfuck and when you run it outputs next hint.
That brainfuck code outputs a simple string -
Decode:747572616e7473657068656c6540676d61696c2e636f6d

After decoding, it gives you the email address.
I have created a IFTTT flow which triggers when there is an incoming email with subject &quot;HOG RIEEDERRRRR&quot; and it is from my friend&#x27;s email address.
Once this condition matches, IFTTT sends an email back with gift coupon details.
Once timer ran out it reveals a link to brainfuck visualizer code.
If he can&#x27;t solve the puzzle in 3 days, an email triggers and sent gift coupon details to friend&#x27;s email address. Again using IFTTT.
That&#x27;s all folks!

                    <span>Many modern web platforms leverage on maps and location-based features to provide services to users. Some popular examples of this are Uber and Airbnb. 
With the  TomTom Maps SDK , including a map in your website has never been easier. The toolkit enables access to various mapping features including street maps, real-time traffic conditions, fuzzy search and route planning for travellers.
As a developer, you can leverage on TomTom&#x27;s APIs methods to build and customize maps in your web or mobile application.
Let&#x27;s walkthrough the process of adding a map to your website using the TomTom Maps SDK. In the end, I&#x27;ll include a link to the source code for this project for reference.

                    <span>This week I successfully published my Static Site Generator static-dodo as an NPM package.
After creating an account at npmjs.com I used the command npm login from the terminal to link my npm account.
I changed the version in package.json to 1.0.0 and also added a tag to my latest commit with:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &quot;1.0.0 Release&quot;

I then published my project using the command npm publish. 
After I made some changes to the repo, I decided to unpublish the package and start from the beginning. I decided to rebrand the project from &quot;dodo-ssg&quot; to &quot;static-dodo&quot; and publish it with the new name.
Gus McCallum tested the program on his computer by installing it with:

Linear Regression is the first algorithm in the Demystifying Machine Learning series and in this article we&#x27;ll be discussing Linear Regression using Normal equation. This article covers what is Linear Regression, how it works, the maths behind the normal equation method, fixing some edge cases, handling overfitting and code implementation.
Linear Regression in simple terms is fitting the best possible linear hypothesis (a line or a hyperplane) on the data having a linear relationship so that we can predict the new unknown data point with the least possible error. It&#x27;s not necessary to have a linear relationship in data but having such can lead to approximately close predictions. For a reference take a look at the below representation.

Eleven weeks ago when I started in Open Source Development 600 at Seneca I never thought I would get to the point of actually releasing something into the wild. Over the term we have been working on our individual static site generators. The purpose of these tools is to take a text file or Markdown file and parse it into a valid HTML document. 
It can include a variety of features depending on the student, but some of the options for my own textToHTML include stylesheets, using a config file instead of the command line, and having an output option to specify a folder to put the HTML documents into.
Throughout the weeks, we have been contributing to Open Source projects on GitHub and making pull requests. Included in this is the idea of contributing to each other&#x27;s SSG&#x27;s. Coll…</span>

                    <span>Does anyone NOT use a debugger? I can&#x27;t remember the last time I did. It&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t dislike them, I just don&#x27;t need to use them. The main reason for this is because I have a certain development methodology that either produces less bugs, catches them at a unit test level, or makes tracking them down much easier.
Here are my tips...
1. Write your own COS cheat-sheet.
This is mainly for anyone that is new to COS. One of the biggest bug hazards is not knowing how certain commands and functions work. Take the time to play with a language and try out all of its variances. The process of then documenting your own cheat-sheet will cement the knowledge and provide a quick reference review tool. Not only will you become more productive, but you will certainly write less of those a…</span>

This post will cover some of the things I learned along the way. I mostly from a TypeScript/Node background and will make comparisons between the two where applicable.
I have found that having a tangible end goal increases my odds of project completion by nearly 100%. In this case, the goal is to create a command line program that simply POSTs requests to my personal notes application engram.
This is not just a learning or for fun project as I recently realized that the command line is a great place for the input of quick notes. When I’m working, I sometimes find myself investigating something in the terminal and realize that I have a thought that I’d …</span>

本周话题：美国宪法拍卖，一个区块链案例
上周四（11月18日），美国纽约有一场拍卖会，拍卖第一版印刷的美国宪法。这件事很有意思，因为它跟区块链有关。
两百多年前，美国打赢了独立战争，13个殖民地的代表聚在一起开会，起草了宪法，决定建国。

宪法通过后，一共印刷了500份，让代表们带回各州。留存到现在的有13份，其中只有一份在私人手里，这次拍卖的就是它。


一个区块链爱好者看到了这件事。晚上在群里聊天，他随口提了一句，有人就说：&quot;我们集资去参加吧！&quot;
大伙一听，觉得很好玩，通过区块链，向全世界的网友集资，去竞标一件古董。以前没人这么干过，就让我们试试看，证明技术有这个潜力。
说干就干，他们就在区块链上成立了一个组织，叫做&quot;宪法 DAO&quot;（ConstitutionDAO），专门负责这件事，相当于项目公司。
他们注册了域名 ConstitutionDAO.com，整个网站只有一个页面（下图），解释了整件事情。

下面就是最关键的部分了，怎么才能收到钱呢？
令人意想不到的是，这反而是最容易的部分。专门的区块链工具，都已经开发出来了，在互联网上公开提供服务，可以直接拿来用。
集资服务叫做 Juicebox（下图）。它将每个项目的合约，写入区块链，并提供一个钱包接收资金。所有提供资金的人，会收到项目的代币，作为出资证明，享受相应的权益。

有了集资账户还不够，还必须让大家相信，项目组织者不会卷款跑路。大伙转账以后，组织者将这些钱转到他的个人钱包，那可…</span>

笼子和翅膀，你更喜欢哪一个？

@潘誉晗：电影以音乐剧作曲家乔纳森·拉森的故事为蓝本，讲述了 1990 年为了梦想而不断奋斗的乔。即使工作不是一帆风顺，即使走商业路线可以给他带来更好的生活，可他始终没有放弃，只因那不是他心里真的想要呈现给观众的故事。
我相信，即使观众对于乔纳森·拉森没有特别了解，可是当听到开场的旁白「在获得托尼奖之前，在获得普利策戏剧奖之前，在《吉屋出租》这出剧的票被卖完之前，我们就已经失去乔了」时，心里还是会突然感到一阵刺痛。

这些 App 值得买
Affnity
今年，Affinity 提供了全场 7 折优惠活动，这里包括桌面应用、插件、工作手册等内容，另外针对 iPad 应用提供更为给力的 5 折优惠！对于从事图形设计、排版的用户来说，由于 Affinity 的创意设计应用均采用了一次买断制，也许是比 Adobe 更为实惠的选择。

台式机应用
支持 Windows 以及 macOS，三款套件 Affinity Photo、Affinity Designer、Affinity Publisher 分别对标 Adobe Photoshop、Adobe illustrator、Adobe InDesign，涵盖图像处理、矢量图设计以及桌面排版，但 Affinity 系列整体上要比 Adobe 套件轻量得多。

Affinity Designer（ ¥348 → ￥248）
Affinity Photo（¥348 → ¥248）
Affinity Publisher（¥348 → ¥248）

iPadOS 版 Affnity 应用
iPadOS 版的 Affinity Photo 和 Affinity Designer 拥有与台式机版同样强大的功能，其便携性非常适合将 iPad 带出去完成工作。

Affinity Designer for iPad（¥148 → ￥68）

作为 2019 年才入坑 F1 的萌新车迷，我想借本文分享一下自己的入坑经历和路径推荐。如果有小伙伴因为近期大热的中国车手周冠宇而对 F1 产生了一点兴趣，可以通过这篇文章更快地进入 F1 的世界。我也会在文中简单介绍一下目前的 F1 格局和规则，老车友亦可温故知新。
引言
随着周冠宇加入 F1 阿尔法罗密欧车队的消息正式公布，史上第一位来自中国大陆的正式车手将要征战下赛季 F1 的新闻一夜刷屏。在关于中国车手的讨论中，有人为华人在赛车领域的成就而喝彩，也有部分网友质疑他是花钱「买」位置、「带资进组」等，引发了一些争议。
那么，对于一个不了解 F1 比赛的人来说，这个坑到底值不值得入呢？
我们还是先了解一下，F1 到底是啥比赛，以及好看在哪儿。
F1 是什么？看点在哪里？
很多小伙伴一听到 F1，基本第一反应就是舒马赫和法拉利，毕竟这是 F1 几十年历史中最为成功的车手和车队。但除此之外，大部分非爱好者就了解不多了，可能只会偶尔在体育新闻里零星听到过奔驰车队夺得几连冠、刘易斯汉密尔顿拿到个人第 100 个大奖赛冠军之类的新闻。
F1 是什么比赛
F1 全称为 Formula One，中文名叫一级方程式赛车，是一个由 国际汽车联盟 举办的最高等级的 赛车 比赛。名称中「方程式」是指一组所有参赛车辆都必须遵守的规则。F1 一年为一个赛季，包括一系列二十多场大奖赛（Grand Prix），每场比赛的结果算入积分系统并以此确定两个年度世界冠军：一个颁予车手，一个颁予车队1。

OPPO 新品发布会

OPPO 于 11 月 25 日正式发布全面升级的人像视频手机 OPPO Reno7 系列手机，新机前置猫眼镜头采用了和索尼一同研发的全新 RGBW 传感器——IMX709，从根本上提升感光能力，传感器逻辑层上内置 OPPO 自研硬件级 IP 即 RGBW 图像处理单元，同时采用DTI像素隔离技术，显著减少了像素之间的信号串扰，从而有效提升信噪比，避免偏色、伪色等现象，这使得该机目前成为了前置摄像头感光能力最强的手机，相对 Reno6 感光能力提升 60%，同时画面噪点降低 35%。且得益于硬件级 DOL-HDR 功能支持，IMX709 具备更强的动态范围能力，在暗光、逆光环境下对人像细节的捕捉和呈现比传统 RGGB 传感器也更具优势。

后置镜头部分则搭载 OPPO 与索尼联合开发的 IMX766 旗舰级主摄，带来更丰富的拍摄玩法，人像模式 2.0 能够实现接近单反的人像虚化和光斑效果，开启 AI 场景增强后能根据暗光、逆光等复杂环境下，自动调用月光夜景算法与 Live-HDR 算法，深度还原人脸肤色与背景。

工艺上首次将航天级光刻工艺应用于手机后盖，通过激光显影技术在晶钻工艺基础上二次光刻，形成 120 万道细密光栅纹理，让玻璃后壳具备流星雨般的视觉观感和立体触感。在机身正面，Reno7 系列采用行业领先的极窄边框工艺，将屏占比提升至 92.8%，镜头模组上引入光纤热弯工艺，将 1mm 直径的光纤环绕主摄系统一周形成呼吸灯效果，并采用陶瓷彩镀镜圈，实现光哑一体设计，将主摄镜头的防刮耐磨性能提升至普通金属的 10 倍。

硬件配置上，Reno7 Pro 和 Reno7 分别搭载天玑 1200-MAX 和骁龙 778G；前者为游戏玩家带来了 90 FPS 极限稳帧、超级闪电启动 2.0 和全场景网络优化，内置 4500 mAh …</span>

                    <span>写在开头的话
其实早在情报贴放出来的时候，讨论群里面关于人吃人的话题早已吵翻天了，但是直到看到完整的漫画正文，笔者收获到的却是一份更为沉重的感悟，米二真正想告诉读者的并不是吃人肉这种猎奇向的噱头，而是探讨长生不老之人如何做到对”初心“的坚守。

初心，也就是笔者之前在其他分析文中提到过的”道“。如果有兴趣的读者可以回去看下笔者关于”道“的分析。在此就不多做赘述了，开始本期的分析。
如何看待无根生的“道”
一、长生不老的诱惑
在中西方各个文明圈中，“长生不老”都是一个永恒且共通的话题。古今中外都有无数的人为之疯狂，希望去寻找答案。古人寻找修仙之法、寻找灵丹妙药；现代的科学家探索细胞分裂，研究人类的基因，也寄希望于能够找到永生的答案。
东方求长生
自古就有所谓当了皇帝想成仙，我真的还想再活五百年之类的愿望。
《太上纯阳真经·了三得一经》：“天一生水，人同自然，肾为北极之枢，精食万化，滋养百骸，赖以永年而长生不老。”
从秦始皇派徐福出海寻找蓬莱、瀛洲诸仙山上的仙人，欲求长生不老药为开端。而其后二千多年的帝王们，在追求长生不老药这件事上献出生命者络绎不绝。
汉武帝刘彻在追求长生不死的帝王队伍中也是“出类拔萃”的一位，甚至比秦始皇嬴政还疯狂。汉武帝追求长生不死在《史记·武帝本纪》中有很多篇幅。几乎一半的篇幅都在讲汉武帝终其一生如何宠信方士，如何劳师动众追求仙药。[1]
唐太宗，这又是一位千古一帝，历史上有名的明君，但也一心追求长生不老。唐太宗曾嘲笑过秦始皇和汉武帝，说秦始皇想求长生被方士骗了，说汉武帝求神仙，把女儿也嫁给了方士。可惜没想到的是晚年的唐太宗也迷恋上了长生不老，长生不死，甚至还被所谓的“不老神药”毒死。新旧唐书和资治通鉴都有唐太宗晚年食丹药的记载，类似吃长生不老药。史料记载，“服胡僧药，遂致暴疾不救”。[2]
跟唐太宗一样，嘉靖皇帝也迷恋长生不老，长生不死，大量服食丹药。…</span>

Halo Infinite has officially launched but even though it has been 6 years since the release of Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is STILL making the same mistakes. It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. 

I saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.

Halo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. 

So again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release

Landing your first engineering role after getting a degree in computer science (or software engineering) is a challenging process. 
There are so many software engineering vacancies, but a significant majority of them are for those with at least 2+ years of experience. There are not enough junior positions on the market, so the competition for entry-level roles is high. Yet, it is still possible to land an engineering role, even without experience. 
The following tips are mainly dedicated to computer science or software engineering graduates looking to land their first engineering role. However, self-taught developers and boot-camp graduates can still benefit from this article.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.
Displaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.
In this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.
The procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.
The first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.
When you move it, you can paste this code for the script:
GIT&#x3D;&#x60;xcrun -find git&#x60;
GIT_REV&#x3D;&#x60;${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD&#x60;
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c &quot;Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}&quot; &quot;${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}&quot;

In the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.
Now, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.
To display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:
let revision &#x3D; Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: &quot;REVISION&quot;) as? String 

In Objective-C we would do it like this:
NSString *revision &#x3D; [NSBundle.mainBundle objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@&quot;REVISION&quot;];</span>

This article presents an open-source Flask Dashboard crafted with authentication, database, and Docker support on top of Azia Admin, a colorful dashboard template. The product can be used to prototype fast a new dashboard on top of the existing codebase. For newcomers, Flask is a leading framework written in Python used to code from simple websites to microservices, APIs, or complex eCommerce solutions. 
Thanks for reading! 
👉 Flask Azia Admin - product page
👉 Flask Azia Admin - LIVE Demo

Azia Dashboard is a beautifully designed admin template featuring a fine selection of useful Bootstrap components and elements. The pre-built pages of the templates are intuitive and very well-designed.
Azia features many essential utility classes that can help cut down CSS bloat and modify CSS components instantly.
The product requires a minimal programming kit to be present and properly installed in the workstation in order to clone and compile the sources:
Python3 - the language that powers Flask
GIT - used to download the sources from Github
A modern editor like VsCode or Atom


Docker - (optional) for an automatized setup
Probably the most easier way to use the product is via Docker, a popular virtualization and containerization software.
👉 Step #1 - Download the source code
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-azia-dashboard.git
$ cd flask-azia-dashboard

👉 Step #2 - Start in Docker
$ docker-compose pull   # download dependencies 
$ docker-compose build  # local set up
$ docker-compose up -d  # start the app 

Once all the above commands are executed, we should see the starter running in the browser at the address http://localhost:85

                    <span>Storecle is a neat uni-directional app state management for React and Solid (❤️).
Storecle uses a simple mental model which lets you access app-wide actions and their results by using Context API.
To improve the code re-usability, Data Suppliers use a middleware pattern. They are executed in the order you specify and pass a snapshot of Store from one to another, letting you split the logic into small, specified functions.
It works with both React and Solid (it&#x27;s framework agnostic to certain degree).
It uses Context API and useEffect / createEffect to provide action re-triggers based on specified Store changes.
It facilitates splitting the business logic into granual, re-usable functions by applying a middleware pattern.

I am a backend software engineer in N26, Barcelona office. In N26 we use kotlin and we build microservices, as you can imagine, to run the digital bank.
We were working on a backoffice microservice, that somehow handled some data about our customers and exposed some endpoints to change them (like a CRUD but not exactly).
So I cannot tell the problem using the same data because those are privileged, but I can explain the same problem using a simpler example.
Suppose you have a model in your application to store information about a Person:
data class Person(
 val name: String, 
 val address: Address
)

data class Address(
 val streetName: String, 
 val number: String, 
 val city: String
) 

Now imagine you have an endpoint and so a do…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin. Today, I&#x27;d like to talk about my experience of publishing my static site generator to NPM. It&#x27;s quite a fun experience as I finally made my project up and running in public.
I&#x27;ve used this as instruction to publish it to NPM.
You can check it out here
Because I already built my project for quite a long time so, I can skip most of the steps, and just focus on this step and some steps that help me understand the semantic versioning and dist-tags. 
When I first start using command line npm publish to publish the project, I had to sign up and log in to NPM. But I encountered an error where it said something like this
npm ERR! code E403
npm ERR! 403 403 Forbidden - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/cv-ssg - Forbidden

                    <span>If you were building an application consisting of a user interface and an API, what technology choices would you make and why?
I&#x27;ll go first.
1. TypeScript
2. React &amp; Next.js
React is a battle-tested library for building UI&#x27;s. It has good documentation and a large community. There are so many components already implemented and ready to use, so you don&#x27;t have to build everything yourself.
Next.js has been around for only a couple of years, but it is already one of the most popular tools in the React ecosystem. Next.js offers you so much out of the box. SSR, file-system-based routing, has the potential to improve metrics such as time-to-first-draw (TTFD) and so much more...
3. PostgreSQL or MongoDB

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but I fall asleep every time I’m trying to read typescript documentation. There is something in the way it is written that signals to my brain that I should not even attempt to comprehend it until I had a good night’s sleep, three coffees, and ideally some chocolate to stimulate the brain cells. I think I now found my purpose for the next few months: I want to re-write typescript documentation in a way that is actually understandable by a casual reader 😊
Let&#x27;s start with one of the pain points many developers are struggling with: generics! And we’re going to start with a bottom-up approach: let’s implement a component without generics, and introduce them only when we need them.

AWS CodePipeline helps in orchestrating CI/CD pipeline all the way from building and testing to deploying applications, from development to production environments.
However, one of the limitations of AWS CodePipeline is its inability to dynamically execute or skip any pipeline action.
This post demonstrates how to setup a CI/CD pipeline to dynamically orchestrate and execute actions based on inputs
This solution uses the following AWS services:
AWS CodeCommit – Source Control
AWS CodeBuild – Build System
AWS CodePipeline – Continuous Delivery
AWS Step Functions - Workflow automation using state machines
A change or commit to the code in the CodeCommit application repository triggers CodePipeline with the help of a CloudWatch event.
The pipeline downloads the code from the Co…</span>

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve just studied html, css and basic javascript and are starting with some framework that uses node, like react, you may have some doubts about managing dependencies. 
So let&#x27;s take a look at some useful commands and get rid of the fear of play with package.json!
First, let&#x27;s create the package.json file using the following command in the terminal:
npm init -y
With this command, we generate a standard package.json file like this:
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;project-name&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;
}

When working with node, some dependencies are used for development purposes and others will remain until the end. So we will have two…</span>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shifting recruiting from a human to largely computer-based process. AI is being used to assist HR in the entire process of candidate selection — from curating job descriptions to conducting early-stage interviews. While this can greatly reduce the number of applications that employers shift through, some have voiced legal and ethical concerns when it comes to AI-based recruiting.

                    <span>.NET SDKs including .NET Core, .NET 5 and .NET 6 support cross-platform. For some reason, you might feel like removing the latest preview version of SDK or a certain version of SDK. You can then use many different methods to delete the SDK and runtime. In this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss the manual way of removing a specific version of the .NET SDK and runtime from MacOS.
In your terminal in Mac OS, type the command, dotnet --list-sdks, and you will see the whole list of .NET SDKs you&#x27;ve installed so far, including the full path.

This time, run the command, dotnet --list-runtimes, to get the whole list of the installed .NET runtimes.

Did you find some differences between SDKs and runtimes, other than the paths? That&#x27;s right. Although you say .NET 6, the SDK and the runtime versions are sl…</span>

很多读者都会好奇少数派的编辑们到底平时都「买了啥」。我们希望通过「编辑部的新玩意」介绍编辑部成员们最近在用的新奇产品，让他们自己来谈谈这些新玩意的使用体验究竟如何。

@北鸮：华硕 ROG 游侠 RX 光学机械键盘

购买渠道：淘宝自购
入手价格：649 元

和手感显在、特点鲜明的段落轴相比，线性轴体之间的手感差异就非常微妙了。除去按键时能直接感受到的压力克数的差别，线性轴的手感差异还体现在弹簧回弹速度（一定程度上决定了轴体是否「跟手」）、轴心稳定性（影响按在边角处的力度变化）、材质和模具精度（会影响轴体的声音与顺滑程度）等等。我自己很爱线性轴，一直希望用上一个压力克数不高、高速回弹、轴心稳定性极好、还能超级顺滑的轴体——其实我也没这么龟毛，是个线性轴我就能用，但之前能最接近我个人所有手感需求的轴体，只有我自己换了更轻的双段弹簧、全面润滑的、新换完模具的樱桃黑轴。我自己都嫌麻烦，这么折腾出来够拼一把键盘的轴就给我累个够呛，发誓再也不弄了。
之所以看上这把 ROG 的光轴键盘，是因为它搭载的 RX 光轴在许多个键盘评测视频里被称作「最强量产线性轴」，作为一个线性轴爱好者，我一直盯着它却不忍心下手。一号那天，ABS 键帽版的游侠 RX 突然从 899 降到了 599，新的 PBT 键帽版本也只要 699 元（我找到的 649 价格已经卖没了）——光这套替换键帽本身就要 200 块，看见这个价格，我想都没想，直接下单。
超长的左 Ctrl 是主要特征
朋友们，到手试机的一瞬间，我就明白之前 ROG 那只大眼睛收来的税都用来干吗了。
ROG 自研的 RX 光轴用了火山口的结构，中置 LED，这样的结构上次见到还是在被我喷得狗血淋头的罗技自研的 Romer-G。Ro…</span>

                    <span>随着感恩节而来的，就是黑色星期五了。这被等同于「海外双十一」的购物节即将来临，不知道你海淘的心有没有荡漾起来？我们挑选了一些数字生活圈子里面一些叫得上名字的东西，看看它们在黑五期间有怎样的折扣和优惠～
智能手机
Google Pixel
Google Pixel 近年以来的热度可以说是只增不减，从它在少数派新玩意栏目的出现频率，已经是可见一斑了。凭借 Google 神一般的优化，Google Pixel 利用并非出色的硬件达到了相当令人满意的流畅度与智能体验，同时整体的机身设计也常常是令人称赞。当然了，整个 Pixel 系列的拍照表现也一直是手机摄影界个中翘楚，而且大陆也没得买，所以 Google Pixel 也成为了海淘手机时很多人的首选。
Pixel 6

Pixel 6 尽管上市不久，但是其亚马逊海外购的价格已经开始下降。如今，128 GB 版本的黑色 Pixel 6 在 亚马逊海外购 已经是 4329.17 元的价格（预估税费为 399.29 元），从英国发货。除了发货时间比较长（1-2 个月）之外，这个价格本身已经是比较合适的价格了。Google Pixel 6 采用 Google 自研的 Tensor 处理器，尽管在实际性能上可能比不过 Snapdragon 888，但是在 Google 的调教下，Android 12 的流畅度是自不用说的。
Pixel 5a

Pixel 5a 本身相对于 5G 版 Pixel 4a 的升级并不大：高通骁龙 765G、6GB RAM，在流畅使用上基本不会有什么问题，主要在续航上有了不小的改进。如今在 Google Store，黑五折扣的情况下，Pixel 5a 的价格还下调了 50 美元，来到了 399 美元；但是需要找到靠谱的转运才能够购买。在 亚马逊海外购 上，Pixel 5a 的价格是 3720 元（预估税费为 372.…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/70123">

                    <span>1Password 在少数派绝对算得上是一个「多数派」。作为一款 2006 年发家于 macOS 平台的密码管理应用，可以说是引领着同类应用发展的「老大哥」。然而这位德高望重的老大哥却在今年「翻车」了，如果你还不清楚前因后果，可以 点击此处 了解。
在这样沸沸扬扬的争议声中测试了半年，开发团队终于正式发布全新的 1Password 8 版本（8.4.0），不知是亟待 Windows 用户认可，还是 Electron 框架真的高效，首次面向大众的竟然是 Windows 版本（macOS 现在处于 公开测试阶段）。怎么说也是三年磨一剑的大版本更新，不如让我们将主观印象先放一边，来看看 1Password 8 到底带来了哪些变化。
界面风格统一，更活泼多彩的外观设计
以往应用评测都会把不同平台区分清楚，以免造成混淆，但由于 1Password 8 统一使用 Electron 编写 UI，Windows 版和 macOS 版几乎是从一个模子里刻出来。除了窗口三键位置默认不同，以及 Windows 版将 macOS 版集成在系统菜单栏中的功能移到了左侧栏右上角的「…」中，其他 UI 设计和交互逻辑不能说十分相似，只能说完全一致。想想自己一篇评测能当两篇用，忽然理解 AgileBits 为什么死磕 Electron 了（并不是）。
开发者介绍文档从「全新」的锁屏开始，那我们就如他所愿。1Password 8 锁屏将 7.X 上下打开的解锁动画改回了更早的左右开启，并增加了用户头像，以后与你密切相关的不再是各种「独立库」，而是绑定订阅账号，从这个界面似乎就能读出开发者的更新方向。

解锁后的主界面，新版依旧保留了三栏设计，最左侧是分类目录和管理项，第二栏是项目清单，第三栏则是具体的项目数据和功能服务。新版相较于此前布局更宽松，清扫了一些划分空间的线条，还加入各种彩色小图标，尤其是「新建项…</span>

在 文科博士生眼里的资料管理、阅读和笔记系统 中我介绍了我的笔记系统的搭建，然而在具体的实践中如何进行操作呢？这次我想就阅读和写读书笔记的阶段，分享一下个人的经验。
读书习惯的养成
作为研究者，每天读书写作搞研究就是本职工作了，然而想要维持日复一日地读书写作可并不是个容易的事情。尤其在状态不好时，长时间没有产出时，被研究内容折磨地头秃时……我想如果作为纯粹作为兴趣爱好的读书学习，可能更容易坚持吧，但却可能更难达到更高深度和更大强度。
为什么我们都知道读书学习对我们人生的重大意义，却难以持之以恒呢？《掌控习惯》(Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break, James Clear, 2018) 这本书告诉我们是时候正视作为一个普通人类的好逸恶劳，好易恶难的本性，这样才能通过策略来帮助自己成为自己想成为的人。而这本书中给我们提供一些建议是：设置良好的工作环境，减小任务难度以降低阻力等。
这些建议应该如何运用到读书学习这件事上呢？我的方法是：

将读书学习的任务切分为一两个小时内可以完成的小任务。譬如在内容上将一本书切分成章节，每个章节是一个任务；在过程上切分读书、做笔记、整理复习等步骤，每个步骤是单独的任务。eg：阅读《xx》书 xx 章；整理《xx》书 xx 章笔记；复习并总结《xx》书 xx 章。
根据任务的性质，为每个任务的顺利实施创造良好的环境。
为每个任务分配时间，根据日程为每天分配任务。至少分配并完成一个，对此进行打卡记录，长期坚持形成习…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是沈乐平导演。今天我们《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》正式上线了，今天正好是感恩节，在此首先感恩大家的关注，也和大家做一番交流。很多人关心，我们为什么会在这个时间点推出《秦时明月》的十五周年版？我想说，最主要的原因正是感恩和回馈。
熟悉秦时明月和玄机的观众都知道，这次的秦时明月十五周年版其实已经是秦时明月第一部的第二次重制。百步飞剑到目前已有三个版本。每一次的重制，我们都将其当作对长久支持我们的观众和粉丝的一份礼物和回馈。


其中一个很重要的原因，是我们发现很多月饼不仅自己会经常回顾这部作品，也会向身边的朋友推荐这部曾带给他感动和启发的作品；但确实15年前制作这部动画的技术，从模型的精度甚至到画面的比例，和今天比已不可同日而语。所以这次的秦时明月十五周年版，我们用现在所掌握的最新技术进行了全面优化，以期给大家呈现全新的面貌。通过这些版本的比较，相信大家也能看出玄机在大家支持、鼓励和鞭策下，不断前进，努力做更好的自己。

秦时明月对于玄机的意义是非凡的。应该说玄机在行业中很长一段时间属于比较独特的公司——整整十年时间只做一部作品秦时明月。这一方面是因为行业发展和团队发展的阶段性；但另一方面，通过这样一段时间的沉淀和团队经验累积，我们也更深刻的理解“十年磨一剑”这句话的意义。我们觉得自己很幸运，能够在15周年的时候，有机会和能力再一次重新打磨这部作品。大家可以看到，这部作品相比原来的版本是一个脱胎换骨的升级——从每一个道具、场景的模型，每一个分镜还有动画，包括光影的处理，实际上都是全新的制作。

十五周年版我们内部专门成立了一个极致动画部，主要聚焦动画的表现，如口型、表情、布料物理运算的提升。十五周年版加强的并不是我们已经受肯定较多的场景、建模和光影特效等方面，主要加强的是角色表演的生动性、细腻度和流畅性。这三方面其实不仅仅在角色，更是一个全方位的体现，比如场景，大家可以看…</span>

                    <span>The cool thing about having an entrepreneurial-related podcast is that I get to speak with very knowledgeable people inside the startup and bootstrapping world.
Arvid Kahl is a multi-talented business professional working as an expert software engineer, a successful entrepreneur, and an energetic writer. And here are the 9 lessons I got from our interview:
The audience-first approach is a much more effective way of gaining success in your venture.
It involves finding a niche or a problem prevalent in an existing target market and creating a product for it.
It is imperative that you understand whom you are creating products for, what their critical problems are, and how your product can solve those problems. 
Every bootstrap founder needs to research the market before starting the project.

                    <span>What is JavaScript?


JavaScript, is also known as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
Vanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.
JS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.
JavaScript can be used for the following:
 Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.
 Creating web and mobile applications.
 Building web servers and developing server applications.
 Game Development
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.
 TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.
 TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.
 JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.
 TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn&#x27;t need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.

The benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:
 Supports Class and Modules.
 Static Type-checking
 ES6 Feature Support
 Clear Library API definition.
 Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.
 Superset of JavaScript

As TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.</span>

                    <span>For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There&#x27;s a global crypto object that&#x27;s available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
&quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you&#x27;re on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&quot;crypto&quot;);
randomUUID(); // &quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;

It&#x27;s cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!
You can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.</span>

                    <span>Bit of a late blog this week. I was deep into some coding until late last night, and then got absolutely flattened by my body&#x27;s immune response to the COVID booster I received around lunchtime. I went from fine to feeling sicker than I&#x27;ve been in a long time in the span of about five minutes. I&#x27;m taking a sick day from work today, and with two more days off for the Thanksgiving holiday, I have plenty of time to lay around and recover. Maybe I&#x27;ll get some solid learning in, too!
This past week started with a whimper: some personal frustrations boiled over and I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot done for a couple days. However, some long days on the tail end of the week helped me regain momentum.

                    <span>一年一度的黑色星期五促销已经开始了，各大海外电商纷纷推出了自己的优惠措施，不知道刚刚经历双十一的血雨腥风的你还有多少力气来参战这场购物节。少数派的作者们推荐了一些正在促销的购物平台，为你的海淘提供一些参考。
亚马逊海外购
🔗 网站链接 &gt;
@鹿额：虽然亚马逊中国内地的电商业务在 2019 年已经停止运营，但其中专营跨境电商的海外购业务依然保留了下来。目前，亚马逊海外购的商品品类囊括了服装、计算机、美妆、玩具等等 12 大类，主要由海外的亚马逊美国/英国/日本/德国负责销售并直邮中国内地，并且在「黑色星期五」期间会有不小的折扣。

相比于自己亲自海淘或是进行转运，亚马逊海外购的一大优点便是相对更加省心，因为购物过程中无需顾虑支付和转运上的一些问题。一些经常海淘的朋友可能曾遇到过这样的情况：在某些美国的品牌官网或是电商网站进行购物时，商家出于一些因素的考虑会对由中国大陆发行的信用卡支付的订单、信用卡账单地址与运输地址不一致的订单或是商品运输地址明显为转运仓库地址的订单进行「砍单」处理，从来带来一些不必要的麻烦以及时间成本。

使用亚马逊海外购则无需担心上述问题，亚马逊网站会在商品详情页清楚地标注商品由哪个国家的亚马逊发货，同时在显著的位置标识商品价格、预估进口税费、预计送达日期区间、是否支持无理由退货等信息，下单付款后等待收货即可，除了商品国际运输所花费的时间稍长（通常约为 7-14 天）、售后服务凭订单收据进行外，其他体验与从国内电商平台购物并无太大区别。
值得一提的是，亚马逊海外淘的预估关税采用「多退少不补」的原则，结算时支付的预估关税如果比实际关税高，亚马逊后续会提供退款，结算时支付的预估关税如果少于实际关税，亚马逊则不会再额外要求你补款（至少我们目前没有遇到过这种情况）。
另外如果你是亚马逊的 Prime 会员或者订单金额满 300 元，运费也可以得到豁免。

                    <span>每天睡好觉真的很难做到，除了从自身角度进行身心平衡，解决病理性问题之外，床品体验也非常重要，枕头更是尤为重要。一只好的枕头会给内心带来扎实的安全感，舒服到身心完全释放。想必挑选到合适枕头的人应该都有过这种感受吧，特别是刚刚换上它的第一晚，那种体验上的升华，扑面，啊不，扑颈而来的幸福感，有一种一夜暴富的喜悦感，后悔它没有早点来。
☁️ 挑选枕头的维度
为了满足不同人群对于枕头的不同需要，挑选枕头需要考虑很多方面。市面上真的有很多种枕头供大家选择，完全不用担心找不到买新款可能比不过自己床上的陈年旧枕。比如从枕头的特性来说，有软硬度的差异，枕头高低的不同，丰富的枕头材质同时还能满足更多体验上的需求。除此之外，还有贴心的细节加以辅助，比如添加抗菌成分或者面料更亲肤，透气性好，睡起来不热等。枕头的材质也有很多讲究，有些人对羽毛过敏会选择乳胶枕、软管枕或者记忆枕，有洁癖的人会更倾向于挑选容易清洗的枕头等等。
众所周知，挑选一款适合自己的枕头，要用自己的喜好和身体的真实感受去匹配枕头的基本情况。人的感官不尽相同，也就需要考虑不同枕头能带来的不同特征。
我把枕头的基本特征分成了以下几个维度：

尺寸——正常情况下，至少要比肩膀宽一些。太小的枕头翻身就会超过它，无法支撑颈部，影响睡眠质量和安全感；
高度——根据身材体型（身材胖瘦、肩膀宽窄以及颈椎的生理弧度等），加上自己对高度的习惯挑选，更贴合自己的颈椎曲度和肩颈空间。更合适的枕头应该贴近肩部，和头颈充分接触；
软硬度——主要考虑是否处在自己舒适的感官范围，也可能会影响枕头的支撑度和对头颈肩的包裹力；
支撑度——支撑度对颈椎尤为重要，办公室久坐的朋友或者颈椎已经出现问题的人，都需要额外注意枕头对颈椎的支撑度。支撑度要认真感受枕上后对颈椎的支撑力是否足够，以及是否可以持续提供支撑，不会因为时间和压力改变而塌陷变瘪，失去支撑力。
材质——是需要综…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 11 月 17 日，Apple 宣布了一项新的服务：Self Service Repair（以下简称自助维修）。
根据 Apple 发布的 新闻稿， 该计划将从 2022 年初开始在美国率先启动，并在 2022 年或更晚推广到其他国家。届时，将允许顾客从 Apple Self Service Repair Online Store 上获取 Apple 原装零件与工具，自行修理设备。除此之外，消费者也可以将更换下来的受损零件交给 Apple 进行回收，并且获得一些鼓励性的购买补贴，将自助维修和 Apple 整体的环保计划进行了一次结合。
至于该计划覆盖的设备范围，Apple 称该计划将首先应用于 iPhone 12 与 iPhone 13 系列产品，搭载 M1 芯片的 Mac 电脑也将很快加入。但是另外两条重要的产品线——iPad 和 AirPods 系列并未被提及。（从它们的结构设计和第三方拆解的结果来看，我猜测这是因为 Apple 还不愿放手让顾客自行维修易弯的 iPad 和容易出现奇妙小问题的 AirPods。）
不出意料，消息发布后引起了热烈的关注和讨论。有观点认为，Apple 这项态度上的「大转弯」是在提前应对美国呼声渐响的「维修权」（right to repair）立法趋势，以及监管机构不断增加的压力。
本文不意在对 Apple 此项变化的动机作出推测和评论，而是想从我作为一个维修爱好者的角度，尝试分析这项服务推出后，对于维修市场和个人用户可能造成的影响。
Apple 是怎么把 iPhone 变得越来越难修的？
众所周知，Apple 曾经对于「维修」这件事的态度并不好——准确来讲，是对于「不经过 Apple 的维修」不友好——这件事甚至从上世纪八十年代便已经开始了。 1984 年发布的第一代 Macintosh 电脑是一款极具乔布斯个人色彩的产品，其…</span>

何谓「数字生活」
二十年前，乔布斯在一次日本节目的采访中提到，他认为个人电脑的发展有三个阶段，分别是针对企业的生产力阶段、针对家庭用户的互联网阶段，以及针对个人的数字生活阶段。在最后一个阶段里，个人电脑作为数码相机、手机等一系列电子设备的数字中心，不仅能帮助人们处理数据表格、邮件等工作方面的事宜，还能够帮助所有人用更丰富的方式表现自己。去创作音乐，去拍照片，去剪辑视频，去表达自己独特的情感。这也是乔布斯一直信奉的价值观，即「站在科技和人文的交叉口上」。
二十年过去，他所设想的早已成真。「数字生活」的时代终于到来，没有人可以例外。
说真的，尽管问题重重，我还是很喜欢自己的数字生活。它让我感知到自我的延伸，以一种现实不能达到的方式。诚然，文字本就是主观的描述，音乐、摄影等一切艺术皆然；而被创作出的数字生活，和真实总有不能避免的差距。但就算「看见美好」和「描述美好」是容易产生误解的表达过程，前者依然使后者具备了价值。这也是我对生活的理解：记录，创作，这是热爱的表现。故而，唯有创作，才能沟通理想，抵御虚无。
关注自我是第一步。在此前的文章里，我介绍了许多记录自我的方法：比如 用 Notion 记下吃过的每一顿饭、构建自己的观影评分体系、用设计软件画下居住过的房间、建立桌面产品收纳的系统 等。这一次，我想做点略超出「自我」范畴外的：为陪伴我的猫猫小耳朵建立一个数字生活中心。

These coin-sized devices help you find lost or stolen items by piggybacking other Apple devices. So when an internet-connected iPhone user passes by an AirTag, the two devices will communicate.

                    <span>松露，是个很无厘头的汉语译名。


顾名思义，它被比喻为松树凝出的露水。但这种生长在地下的真菌，既不在松树枝干上生长，也不依附松针松根形成的自然生态。橡树、榛树、椴树、榉树、桦树、松树、白杨都可以成为松露的生存环境。松树与松露，从没有必然联系。


事实上，直到上世纪80年代，松露在中国的名字依然充满了下里巴人的气息，“土茯苓”“无娘果”“猪拱菌”“臭鸡枞”……松露两字，最早出现在改革开放后的欧美文学译作里。


也许在中国的翻译家眼中，最珍贵最美味的食用真菌，天然就应该与松树搭上关系，比如松茸、松树蕈、松蘑、松耳；而露珠本身，则与可食用真菌一样，隐含着无根无蒂、无体无形，采纳天地灵气和日月精华而生的意蕴。


一个美丽的名词，从诞生之初，就夹带着狗血的误会。







No.1 壹


作为一种食物，Truffle准确的译名不是松露，而是“块菌”。从生物学的分类来看，块菌与羊肚菌的亲缘关系很接近，整个欧亚大陆和北美大陆各地，都能出产这种生长在土壤下的真菌。它是一种典型的世界性生物。


但东西方对它的态度，却有着天壤之别。西方有着悠久的松露食用史，4000年前，生活在两河流域的苏美尔人，就用楔形文字记载了一个孩子将这种食物献给国王的故事。而到了公元1世纪的古罗马时代，美食家阿比西斯在他的传世名作《厨艺》中，已经详细介绍了松露的吃法：煮熟后串起来，加盐烘烤出焦香；另将葡萄酒、橄榄油、胡椒、蜂蜜、鱼酱和酸葡萄汁一起煮沸，加入淀粉后做成蘸酱；最后在松露上用针刺出小孔，泡进蘸酱里吸取味道。


即便到了今天，人工培植相对困难，主要靠野外采集的松露，依然是餐桌上的珍品。但在2000年前，古罗马人已经实现了松露的常态化食用。一方面，贵族的奢靡生活，反映了古代欧洲封建国家的富庶和强大；另一方面，也证明了欧洲人珍视松露的饮食传统。







在中国，松露的应用就落后很多。上下五千…</span>

Synopsis: Set in modern-day America, Bel-Air is a serialized one-hour dramatic analogue of the 90’s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” that leans into the original premise: Will’s complicated journey from the streets of West Philadelphia to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.

This Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / tiktok / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.16.4, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.16.5 in 2021!

The goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, camman18 from twitch / tiktok / twitter , playing Minecraft Java 1.16.5 and not Minecraft Bedrock.

THIS IS THE GREATEST CLIP EVER!!!!!</span>

                    <span>What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in react?


To put simply, controlled components have their data being handled with a react component whereas an uncontrolled component&#x27;s data is being handled with the DOM itself. Let&#x27;s dig into this answer a bit more though starting at the basics and including a few visual examples. 
Form elements are rendered with HTML within React components where data is being accessed and manipulate. When we are discussing uncontrolled and controlled components these are terms that are specifically discussing the way in which the form created is handling and accessing that said data. The data handling can be done a few different ways but is commonly seen using typed elements like,  and  or selected elements such as…</span>

                    <span>Overview:


Machine Learning (ML) and data science applications are in high demand. When ML algorithms offer information before it is known, the benefits for business are significant. Integrating machine learning algorithms for inference into production systems is a technological barrier hence the need for deploying ML models as API&#x27;S. 
In this short article, we implement AI based models to detect COVID-19 in Chest X-rays and CT Scans using four Deep Learning Algorithms: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception. Note, we shall focus mainly on implementing the api and not the model creation. 
To test my live endpoint, send a POST request to the following URL with an x-ray image appended to the body of the request. You will get the following sample output if request was successful:

                    <span>Article by Jay Allen
Learning AWS is complicated enough. But learning AWS is made more challenging when you&#x27;re also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. 
In simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. 
Stacks can be stood up manually. However, it&#x27;s better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…</span>

Slate.js is a highly customizable platform for creating rich-text editors, also known as WYSIWYG editors. It enables you to create powerful, intuitive editors similar to those you’ve probably used in Medium, Dropbox Paper, or Google Docs. These are quickly becoming standard features for many web apps, and tools like Slate make them easier to implement, ensuring your program won’t get bogged down in complexity.
Although Slate is still in beta at the time of writing, it’s natural to ask whether it has the potential to replace more mature platforms like Quill and Draft.js. The short answer is that it&#x27;s far too early to tell, but here are a few facts to support why it could.

Introduction
What are SHAP values?
Walkthrough example
How does Mage explain models?
Conclusion
Machine learning models are usually seen as a “black box.” It takes some features as input and produces some predictions as output. The common questions after model training are:
How do different features affect the prediction results?
What are the top features that influence the prediction results?
The model performance metrics look great, but should I trust the results?
Whatever you say Prince Ali (Source: Giphy)


Thus, model explainability plays an important role in the machine learning world. Model insights are useful for the following reasons:

Informing feature engineering
Directing future data collection
Informing human decision-making

                    <span>So, you&#x27;ve spent hours, weeks, or even months on a project you believe in, and you are damn proud of it. It is capable of solving problems every developer faces, the test coverage is about 110%, and the code itself is just shy of a work of art. But then, as you push your last commit, you remember that, lurking in the shadows of your IDE, was a holdup most developers underestimate: documentation.
Ok, maybe it is not as scary as I make it sound, but still something you should respect, after all, every programmer has, at some point in their life, come across a poorly documented library or package, spent a few minutes of guesswork trying to make it work, maybe even tried reading a bit of the source code, just to finally give up on using it. Turns out, most of the time, an undocumented applicat…</span>

                    <span>Ready? Round 2! ❤️
Hi! Remember when in the previous post I told you what HTML was, what it looked like and what the attributes were? well, it&#x27;s time to start playing with it. So grab paper and pencil and let&#x27;s get started! 
Ok, we know that the tags look like this:
    
 ....... some content .....
 as . 
Tags are generally always lowercase. 
We must close the tags so that they always work.
Well this is the basic structure :

         
            
Hello World    
                  
               …</span>

                    <span>Have you ever googled something, no matter what it is, a recipe, a meme or even a school assignment, and prayed that the answer would show up on a web page? I have too, and that&#x27;s why on more than one occasion I&#x27;ve wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.
Okay! to start with this:
HTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it &quot;programming language&quot; should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a &quot;markup language&quot; because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.
As I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :
content

However this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :


But that&#x27;s not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like &quot;upgrades&quot; of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.
content.

It seems interesting, doesn&#x27;t it? Well, don&#x27;t worry, in the next posts I&#x27;ll be telling you a little more so you won&#x27;t be left wanting. See you in the next one ! and remember to do what you love every day.</span>

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第5天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
🔥 一、组件化
作为一个单工程撸到底的开发人员，想试着将项目进行组件化改造，说动就动。毕竟技术都是写出来的，看着文章感觉懂了，但是实际开发中还是能遇到各种各样的问题，开始搞起来。
💥 1.1 为什么使用组件化
一直使用单工程撸到底，项目越来越大导致出现了不少的问题：
查找问题慢：定位问题，需要在多个代码混合的模块中寻找和跳转。
开发维护成本增加：避免代码的改动影响其它业务的功能，导致开发和维护成本不断增加。
编译时间长：项目工程越大，编译完整代码所花费的时间越长。
开发效率低：多人协作开发时，开发风格不一，又很难将业务完全分割，大家互相影响，导致开发效率低下。
代码复用性差：写过的代码很难抽离出来再次利用。
💥 1.2 模块化与组件化
🌀 1.2.1 模块
将一个程序按照其功能做拆分，分成相互独立的模块，以便于每个模块只包含与其功能相关的内容，比如登录模块、首页模块等等。
🌀 1.2.2 组件
组件指的是单一的功能组件，如登录组件、视频组件、支付组件 等，每个组件都可以以一个单独的 module 开发，并且可以单独抽出来作为 SDK 对外发布使用。可以说往往一个模块包含了一个或多个组件。
💥 1.3 组件化的优势
组件化基于可重用的目的，将应用拆分成多个独立组件，以减少耦合:
加快编译速度：每个业务功能都是一个单独的工程，可独立编译运行，拆分后代码量较少，编译自然变快。
解耦：通过关注点分离的形式，将App分离成多个模块，每个模块都是一个组件。
提高开发效率：多人开发中，每个组件模块由单人负责，降低了开发之间沟通的成本，减少因代码风格不一而产生的相互影响。
代码复用：类似我们引用的第三方库，可以将基础组件…</span>

                    <span>因为官方deepl插件太多不方便的地方，因此在论坛东拼西凑搞出了个目前比较满意的修改版本。
目前google版本只有iphone使用时才是最新版本翻译，ipad版本因为marginnote本身的webview的user agent 设定依然停留在ios13.3，因此翻译结果会非常残破（旧版google翻译）。 希望能用上新版google翻译的大家就请跟我一起向官方反应这个状况吧，这个插件是解决不了的。

                    <span>今年的十一假期期间我没有继续宅在家里，而是选择打破两点一线的工作日生活，去探寻不一样的城市和自然美景——当然除了感受异地的人文风景之外，我还有另外一个目的：作为「村长」，为了更好地建设村落而积累更多的「步数」。
这或许是我第一次因为一款游戏而「运动」。

一个用「步数」建成的「猫猫村」
比起那些需要不断氪金或者让你看广告的手游，我更喜欢《猫猫村》这种「无负担」的「健康手游」——没有虚拟世界里的激烈竞争，也没有让我沉迷到不可自拔的关卡，整个游戏玩下来的感觉只有一个：原来只要健康生活就可以满足你所建设的这个《猫猫村》中村民们的需求，让这些可爱的「像素猫」可以开心愉悦地生活。

而如何建设你的猫猫村？答案就在自己脚下——尽力地在现实世界中坚持运动来获得步数，就可以用来在游戏中建设房屋、道具、家具等，并以此让猫猫村中村民生活得更惬意，而村民们如果对当前的生活感到满意就会产生「爱心」：这同样也是一种重要的建设资源，随着爱心获取越多，你可以一步步地解锁更高级的建筑以及道具，从而让你的村落设施更全面，进一步地扩大村落吸引更多的村民入住。

我不知道这样以运动步数作为游戏中重要资源的设计是否更符合现代年轻人的「佛系生活方式」，但不得不说《猫猫村》让我们每天的步数有了更多的使用场景，使得每天的运动可能不再仅仅是蚂蚁森林中新增的绿地、微信运动中每日的步数排行榜，或者是 Apple Watch 获得的运动成就徽章……

这款游戏为那些看似日常的运动赋予了一种新的使命感——让自己的努力为游戏中的「他们」带来美好的生活，这又何不是另一种类型的自我心灵疗愈？
像素画风下的温馨小村
不仅仅是游戏要素，从画面上《猫猫村》就完全有别于我玩过的任何一款游戏，甚至你可能会觉得它无论在画面上还是设置方面都显得有些「简陋」——八位像素风格的画面，整个场景设计成了横板卷轴，因而整个村落的建设完全是在一个 2D 的平面中进行铺设，甚至在建设玩法上实际更像是在一个线上依次摆设——既不能调整建筑的大小，也不能调整建筑或者家具的位置。

当然对于喜欢像素风游戏的朋友而言，《猫猫村》又是很独特的，类似早年八位机游戏的文本互动方式在现在看来，显得是那么地复古与时尚。

这种画面上的简单让你不由得会想到早年的像素风游戏甚至是那些横板过关的游戏——因此游戏的发展进行或者是场景的解锁都是向两侧进行，比如你可以根据猫猫村民 NPC的提示来扩展村落边界，或者是通过建设不同的建筑来创建更多的子场景，而这些分散的子场景让游戏随着时间推进一步步地变得更加丰富有趣。

每天就玩十分钟：真的不能再多了！
如果你每天都抽出时间玩上一会儿《猫猫村》，你可能会觉得他是你见过的最「佛系」、最不会让人上瘾的游戏了。

游戏中的玩法其实非常简单，你需要带领一群像素猫猫建立一个自己的村庄，而最初的生产资料就是你每日的步数，我们需要使用步数来兑换最为基础的建筑，比如水井、树等等，通过和猫猫们的共同努力来建设村落中的第一栋房屋。

随着游戏的进行，猫猫们在村落生活的同时开始产生大量的「❤️」，同样作为生产资料，你可以使用「❤️」来安装抵御偷心贼的武器，也可以用来兑换一系列的新建筑，而猫猫 NPC 也会随着时间推移给出相应的建设请求，并一步步地提醒你建设新的建筑与设施。

当你真正上手之后就会发现，实际上整个《猫猫村》的节奏并不快，相比那些几个小时就开始提醒你继续建设的放置类手游，《猫猫村》的平均游玩时间可以说非常短，而我每一次的游戏时间也在十几分钟左右，在完成 NPC 给的小任务之后往往更多的是点触村民猫猫来进行互动。

随着游戏的进行，你可以建造的建筑以及家具就会又来越多，这些建筑物或者家具其实也暗藏玄机，比如你可以使用幸运转盘进行抽奖，甚至你可以通过将记事板放到房间里，并使用密码锁给房间上锁，在猫猫村中撰写你的「私密日记」。

结语
在上手《猫猫村》之后，我带上村民回到了自己生活的城市，回到了那些用钢铁水泥构筑的森林和那封闭的格子间，好在手机的那一头还有一些用像素构成的小猫在等着我，等着我在疲累的工作之余，和他们简单地来一次互相治愈的游戏。

                    <span>比起早年的功能的增加和设计语言的迭代，这两年的 iOS 更新显然更具有时代的印记 —— 疫情时代下（尤其是 Apple 所在的美国），无法预知的明天和不能见面的彼此，要怎样才能继续保持真切的沟通和高效的工作？经过一年的思考，Apple 终于在 iOS 15 的更新概览页面给出了答案 ——「更有聊，更专注」这六个大字，已经定下了整个 iOS 15 更新的基调。

更有聊，自然指的是同播共享和 FaceTime、信息中的各种分享功能；而更专注，自然就是下面要详细聊到的「专注模式」了。
实际案例
相信大部分读者都已经不止一次地看过专注模式的详解，但这些「详解」往往显得有些不够「接地气」，普通用户看完也很难创建属于自己的专注模式。
下面我们就结合实际的案例，来具体分析都用到了哪些操作。更重要的是，这些案例希望能对你设定自己的专注模式提供思路，起到一个抛砖引玉的作用。
写稿模式
作为一个自由撰稿人，写稿几乎已经成为了生活中最日常的事情，而它正好也需要我长时间保持状态，所以为它创建一个专注模式是再合适不过了。
首先，我们进入专注模式的页面，点击右上角创建一个新的专注类型。系统本身会为你建议几种专注模式，不过这里我们就直接选择自定。命名并做好个性化操作之后，点击下一步就可以正式进入详细的设置选项。
一般来说，电话和信息已经不是我的主要联系方式，因此我只给家人添加到了允许列表中，其它的都选择了不允许。当然，为了能让他人在真的有急事时能联系到我，我也会打开允许重复来电的选项。

接下来是设定允许通知的 App。毕竟是个需要长时间集中精力的活，写稿模式下的通知提醒自然是越少越好。因此诸如微信、微博、Instagram 这类社交应用自然是排除在外的，仅仅允许一些较重要的 App 和时效性的通知推送。值得一提的是，这里面的 App 其实不仅包括了 iPhone、iPad App，还包括了 Appl…</span>

注：

文中提及的 Lightroom、Photoshop、After Effects、Premiere Pro，以及其它 Creative Cloud apps，其新功能已上线正式版，订阅用户可在 Creative Cloud 中更新；

Lightroom &amp; LrC
新的蒙版面板
在 Lightroom 2022 的蒙版面板中，除原有的「画笔、径向滤镜、渐变滤镜」，新增了「选择主体、选择天空、颜色范围、明亮度范围、深度范围」五个蒙版工具，相信大家对「选择主体」并不陌生，在 Photoshop CC 中，借助由 Adobe Sensei 驱动的选择主体（Select Subject）功能，可以轻松地选中图像中的物体，此次 Adobe 将这一功能下放至 Lightroom 与 Lightroom Classic 终于肯将牙膏挤给 Lightroom，进一步提高摄影后期的工作效率。
Lightroom：新蒙版面板
选择主体功能
在 Lightroom 2021 及以往版本，如果需要对照片中的某一物体进行分区处理，只有两种方法 —— 导出 DNG 后导入到 Photoshop 处理，或者是「手搓蒙版」。遇到复杂物体时，真的是要「笑嘻嘻」了。
当用户更新至 Lightroom 2022 后，可根据需要选择照片中的主体、天空，以及根据明亮度、颜色进行抠像处理。

但凡能摆个桌子有点地方，大家都有把东西收拾收拾弄个漂亮桌面的想法。但理想总是很丰满， 现实一直很骨感，大部分人对于怎么收拾桌子根本就无从下手。笔者根据自己的布置经验，来给大家说说要注意的几个点。

01 桌面结构拓扑
设备拓扑还请见图，具体内容在下面的小节中展开。

02 理线与思路
俗话说得好：简约风格靠藏，极简风格靠扔。设备众多，自然各种设备的线缆缠在一块就堪比盘丝洞了。桌面的布置，不管是有线还是无线化，需要注意的都是把线捋好顺下去。一堆不同粗细和外皮材质的线在桌面上盘根错节，那可太难看了。那自然，整洁的第一步自然是把桌面的线缆都尽量放在桌后/下。

不过线缆本身就有长度和重量，很多设备还需要适配器，光用线自己坠着肯定会一股脑全掉下来。这个时候这种桌下理线槽的作用就体现出来了：适配器直接放在架子上，一些软质线材绑好后放在架子上，硬质线材就卷在架子上面，这样布置好就不会乱糟糟一团了。只要足够长，就不存在放不下的情况。

另外关于供电：一个是插座的插孔一定要互不干涉，方便尽量全部都能安排上；二是也要放在桌后/下不在视野内出现。符合这样要求的自然就是 PDU 插座了。像是升降桌这种有有横承桌子，就可以用扎带直接绑住 PDU 两边的耳朵固定。

那么从桌下转到桌上。现在显示器是明基 EW3270U，日常使用情况下是要接入三根线的：一根电源线，一根 HDMI 线和一根 Type-C 线，分别用于供电和设备连接。如果直接使用显示器自身的支架和木制增高架的话，建议将线捋好后用扎带绑紧，再由后部垂下以达到藏线的效果。而是用悬臂支架就省事了，只…</span>

Lyrics:
Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies yeah
I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her maybe
Did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain’t it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits
And ain’t it funny
How you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don’t look like it

Allows you to transform JSON data into an object whose members can be queried using the member access operator. Unlike json.dumps in the standard library that returns a dictionary object, this library returns a JSONObjectMapper object. The attributes of these objects are defined by the contents of the JSON data provided to it
It can be installed using pip 
pip install json2obj
https://github.com/trumpowen/json2obj

import datetime
from json2obj import JSONObjectMapper 

person &#x3D; JSONObjectMapper(&quot;&quot;&quot;{ &quot;name&quot; : &quot;trumpowen&quot; , &quot;age&quot; : 125 }&quot;&quot;&quot;) 
person.name &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;trumpowen&quot; # true
person.age &#x3D;&#x3D; 125 # true 
# replaces and overwrites 
person.name &#x3D; {} 
person.name.first_name &#x3D; &quot;Wilkins&quot; 
person.name.last_name &#x3D; &quot;Owen&quot; 
person.name.other_names &#x3D; [&quot;Trump&quot;]

# add new attribute. If this is not desired, you can initialize the object with readonly set to True. This will prevent the addition of new attributes and changing the values of existing attributes 
person.dob &#x3D; datetime(1900, 12, 6) 
json_data &#x3D; str(person) # returns a string representation 
json_as_dict &#x3D; person.to_dict() # returns a dictionary representation 

Use help(obj) , where obj is an instance of JSONObjectMapper</span>

                    <span>Diariamente o ser humano vem procurando e criando meios para acelerar a evolução, e aqui eu vou passar um pouco de 3 pilares que eu tenho utilizado evoluir cada vez no meu desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional.
A falta de foco e uma das piores pedras no caminho dos devs quando se trata de evolução, o grande leque de tecnologias que surgem diariamente faz com que muitos devs(principalmente os iniciantes) não tenham um foco especifico em uma stack e isso acaba atrapalhando a evolução de muita gente.
Não se trata qual e a melhor tecnologia, se trata de qual tecnologia você e melhor desenvolvendo.
Mantenha sua atenção no que você esta estudando no momento.
ouvir uma frase uma vez que falava que longevidade &gt; intensidade
E para você evoluir com tecnologia que você escolheu não basta só ter foco se você não exercita, e necessário MUITA PRATICA, e a pratica que acelera o seu desenvolvimento.
Programação e uma disciplina pratica, e ela que vai te da toda bagagem e experiência para vencer os desafios que você enfrenta no seu dia a dia e te transforma e um profissional muito mais capacitado no mercado.
A teoria só funciona quando você sabe quando e onde aplicar.
A sensação de esta apenas copiando código e super normal para quem ta começando, mas a repetição se transforma em repertorio e todo o código começa a fazer sentido
Ter pessoas ao seu lado, vivendo o mesmo contexto que você e o melhor combustível que um dev pode receber, o aprendizado compartilhado e a troca de experiências faz a sua evolução se tornar mais leve e divertida.
Quem nunca teve um bug que não resolvia a dias e um amigo ajudou a resolver. Esta ao lado de devs mais experientes faz com que você esteja sempre atualizado com as melhores praticas e tecnologias do mercado
Conhecimento quanto mais a gente divide, mais se multiplica!</span>

                    <span>These are some rules that I have lazily picked up over the past four years of professional development on angular.
I generally work on small to medium projects without the time to integrate a formal state management system.
It is for this reason that there are data services that try to solve the problem of carrying communication around. If anyone has any further questions or curiosities regarding these points feel free to leave a comment.
methods must be extracted into functions until nothing can be extracted anymore
the component logic shold refer only to local resources of the component as much as possible
dataservices deal with data I/O with the server
the business Logic must live within the dataservice and all components should be of assistance to the business Logic, visualization assistance and small local logics to visualize and modify data
components (internal to the feature internal to the root component) must implement the root dataservice or receive data as input (observables are strongly preferred)
avoid multi-level handovers through inputs, it slows you down and makes refactoring a hassle
if the data as input changed hands more than twice use a dataservice,
each feature must have its own module and declare components related only to that feature
putting the general dataservice next to the feature module is the best way to indicate the root from which to start exploring the code
the beginning of the end of the data flow must take place within the dataservice

the substrate cache-services for API calls must live in the provide of the feature module they belong to and refer to
components  can be interaction contexts between dataservices but services are preferred when possible
interaction services can be interaction contexts between dataservices</span>

                    <span>Esse exercício recebe dois inputs iniciais: um integer N, relativo à quantidade de números em um array, e um integer M, relativo a um subarray deslocável que fará a &quot;varredura&quot; dentro do array principal.

N &#x3D; quantidade de números do array
Dessa forma, os arrays estruturados com M &#x3D; 3 serão:
[5, 3, 5]
Como todos os subarrays precisam ter M números, nesse caso esses serão os subarrays possíveis.
Depois disso, precisamos que o programa contabilize qual é o máximo de números únicos existentes em um subarray de tamanho M.
[5, 3, 5] &#x3D; 2 números únicos
Sendo assim, o máximo de números únicos em um subarray será 3. Esse precisa ser o output.

As you can guess I am a Corgi lover and this image placeholder is just perfect for me, and everyone who loves dogs and especially Corgis.
It is easy to use, just a link to Place Corgi site with a width and optional height specified after the URL.
http://placecorgi.com/width/height
Also, we can place a video as a placeholder. To do that, we would add /v to the URL along with width and height
http://placecorgi.com/v/width/height
You can add the Place Corgi js file to your application, which will automatically replace any img tags that have the class corgi with images from Place Corgi.

                    <span>Introduction


Have you ever wondered how search engines like Google, fetch data from different parts of the web and serve it to you as a user, based on your query? The method used by applications like this is termed crawling. 
Search engines work and by crawling and indexing billions of web pages using different web crawlers called web spiders or search engine bots. What these web spiders do is follow links from each web page that have been indexed to discover new ages.
In this short article, you will be building out your own web crawler using Python and its popular web framework for extracting the data you need from websites.
Also, in this tutorial, developers tend to be confused with web crawling and web scraping. We would learn the difference between these two concepts and examine some…</span>

                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>The Prometheus.yml:
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label &#x60;job&#x3D;&#x60; to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: &#x27;prometheus&#x27;

    # metrics_path defaults to &#x27;/metrics&#x27;
    # scheme defaults to &#x27;http&#x27;.

    static_configs:
      - targets: [&#x27;localhost:9090&#x27;]

  - job_name: &#x27;node-exporter&#x27;

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - :9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net&#x3D;&quot;host&quot; --pid&#x3D;&quot;host&quot;  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot;  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs&#x3D;/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type&#x3D;bind,source&#x3D;/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination&#x3D;/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published&#x3D;9090,target&#x3D;9090,protocol&#x3D;tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.</span>

                    <span>A growing number of organizations are switching to cloud services. In this guide, we’ll outline the benefits and challenges of cloud migration.

By Reza Piri  Cloud  November 17, 2021
Cloud computing has boomed in the last decade and cloud adoption is at the top of every tech exec’s to do list. More and more companies are considering migrating to the cloud, but what does cloud migration mean, what does the process involve, and what are the benefits and challenges? In this article we will cover this topic and explain how Gennovacap can help your company with cloud migration services.

                    <span>Imagine you have a large set of news articles, and want to provide a way to allow your users to search through them. For example, here are 5 random articles from the Economist:
An investment bonanza is coming
Who governs a country’s airspace?
What is a supermoon, and how noticeable is it to the naked eye?
What the evidence says about police body-cameras
Who controls Syria?
Let’s think about what kind of queries potential users issue and the articles that we would want to return.
A search for “investment” should return the 1st article.
A search for “supermoon” should return the 3rd article.
A search for “syria” should return the 5th article.
This is quite simple to implement with traditional information retrieval techniques, since these queries have keyword matching.
A search for “banking” …</span>

                    <span>This article is about the strategy of handling errors in your C# GraphQL APIs and is based on Sasha Solomon&#x27;s article about handling errors in GraphQL environments. 
It&#x27;s adopted to asp.net core server implementation (Hot Chocolate) and it&#x27;s a glimpse of how it might look and be used in your next GraphQL application.
Mostly, the mentioned article is about separating &quot;errors&quot; into categories:
errors (e.g. Internal Server Error)
results (Deleted User, Unavailable in Country)
Later on, it encourages to use union types for response modeling. It also highlights the pros of this approach and shows the cons of using the default approach.
GraphQL errors mostly look like this one.

                    <span>Can a person be successful without the zeal or passion to do something? I doubt it! Businesses, CEOs, politicians, successful career men and women, the zeal to pursue it against all odds is what makes them who they are today. The fact is the journey to success is not always smooth. The pain, the struggles, the challenges, the disappointments and so much more are enough to make any man quit. Hence, the end goal becomes the focus, the zeal becomes the driver driving you through the rough road to your destination. 
But what happens when you lose that zeal? Well, it’s okay to be tired, weary, disappointed, and discouraged. It’s all part of human nature and even machines that tend to work like a clock sometimes require reignition once the power is turned off.  The good news is you can restore your passion.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s talk about the infer keyword in TypeScript. I believe, there&#x27;re a lot of developers, who&#x27;ve been confused about infer. When should I use it? How it works? What is the purpose?

Let&#x27;s start with something easier. The next cases will help us to understand the concept of infer. Ok, look at the piece of code:

TypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it&#x27;s a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it. By the way, where will be another type in case of const usage. Try it by yourself. I&#x27;m waiting for your explanation in the comments. This is a small interactive with a reader)
Ok, we&#x27;ve just found out, TypeScript is pretty smart. If a value corresponds to a specific condition, TS can make a decision about its type. Somethi…</span>

When people visit your webpage, they don&#x27;t want to wait for 10 minutes until the page (and all the images) load. In a survey, it was found that 47% of visitors expect a website to load in less than 2 seconds and 40% of visitors leave the website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load.

Thanks to Flatiron School, I was able to prepare for a mock interview to go through these same trials and tribulations as my peers. I am writing this blog post to encourage my fellow aspiring software developers to take every interview opportunity that you can, because just like programming, practice makes perfect. Here is how my mock interview went.

                    <span>Let me describe my coding journey to build a Social Proof component from Frontend Mentors. Frontend Mentors is a online platform that provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs.
The goal is to build this:

The first coding hurdle was setting up the HTML &amp; CSS to create the initial layout and then testing if it flowed decently between mobile and desktop as intended. 
My first decision was deciding between CSS Grid, Flexbox, or a combination of the two. Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool
My tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas. 
GIF of responsive layout

Screen-shot of the Layout

The next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.
Screen shot of app in development, no styling

Now for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. 
The one thing I didn&#x27;t know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time.

I learned how to add multiple background images at one time. 
I was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: 
Design a responsive layout
Build a foundation with HTML
Add content
Style with CSS, section by section
End with functionality (JavaScript &amp; CSS animation/transitions)
This &quot;Ground up&quot; methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra &quot;Slow is Fast&quot;.

We often see technical blog posts from experienced developers sharing their insights from years of coding, hardly ever from someone just starting out. The hardest part of beginning a project is actually imagining a project to start, at least for me. So, I sought inspiration from the internet. (codecademy&#x27;s final project)
Codecademy&#x27;s Final Project in python was to create some terminal program. This was my first project completely from scratch. Of the options at codecademy I decided on the blackjack game. Making a blackjack game seemed fairly challenging but within my grasp. So I got to work. BTW, you can find the source code here
I began by establishing what I would actually need to play blackjack in real life. That being a deck of cards and some people to play with. I didn…</span>

A string is a palindrome when it is the same 
For example:
Write a function named palindrome that takes a single string as its parameter.
def palindrome(string):
    pal_string &#x3D; list( string.casefold() )
    rev_string &#x3D; list( reversed(pal_string) )

    if pal_string &#x3D;&#x3D; rev_string:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(palindrome(&quot;aba&quot;))

def palindrome(string):
    while len(string) &gt; 1:
      head &#x3D; string[0]
      tail &#x3D; string[-1]
      string &#x3D; string[1:-1]
      if head !&#x3D; tail:
        return False
    return True

def palindrome(string):
  if len(string) &lt; 2:
    return True
  return string[0] &#x3D;&#x3D; string[-1] and palindrome(string[1:-1])

def palindrome(string):

Let’s make a query for a temperature api using javascript fetch
First let’s create the interface, we’ll do something simple, using just HTML.

  
  


To present the data we have a div with two spans, one to represent the city and the other to represent the temperature.
const CITY &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;city&#x27;);
const TEMPERATURE &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;temperature&#x27;);
const URL_MAIN &#x3D; &#x27;https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather&#x27;;
const API_KEY &#x3D; &#x27;8f57cb746c4c1d4b48b7f35eba6f6230&#x27;;
const UNITS &#x3D; &#x27;metric&#x27;;

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(loadUrl);

function loadUrl(pos) {
  let lat &#x3D; pos.coords.latitude;
  let long &#x3D; pos.coords.longitude;
  let url &#x3D; &#x60;${URL_MAIN}?lat&#x3D;${lat…</span>

                    <span>In my last post, I showed how to refactor the Dockerfile in your project. I didn&#x27;t want to make the previous post too long, so I didn&#x27;t touch the multistage builds. Here is the post where I will show you how to improve the Dockerfile even more, using multistage builds. Using stages in your builds is not hard to use, but there are some things where the below knowledge may help you 😃
Let&#x27;s take the result of the last article:

                    <span>Olá!
Este é mais um post da seção Design, e nele vamos tratar de um pattern bastante útil em cenários com múltiplas condições, o Chain of Responsibility (CoR, ou Cadeia de Responsabilidade, em tradução livre). Veremos também como integrá-lo ao container de injeção de dependência do ASP.Net Core.
Vamos lá!
Antes de mais nada, precisamos entender qual a utilidade do pattern, ou seja, qual problema ele resolve. Patterns são soluções cabíveis para um dado tipo de problema, e com o CoR não é diferente.
Imagine um cenário onde, para atender a uma dada requisição (ou comando) a satisfação de diversas condições seja necessária e que, para cada condição, pode haver um dado processamento específico a ser realizado ou um tipo de resultado a ser retornado.
Soa estranho? Explico.

网上的视频处理工具非常繁多，收费免费的一大堆，很多人根本不知道怎么选。而在尝试过的软件中，我认为 Handbrake 可能是最好的开源免费跨平台视频压缩和格式转换软件了！作为一款万能视频转码压制工具，它不仅免费，还跨平台支持 Win、Mac、Linux 三大操作系统……

不容错过的新 App
虽然少数派一直在为大家发发现和介绍各平台上的优质 App，但仍有不少设计、功能、交互、体验都非常优秀的 App，还没有被我们发掘和介绍。它们可能是一款老 App，也可能是近期上架的新 App，我们会在这里介绍给你。
Quit All：在 Mac 上一键退出应用程序

平台：macOS
关键词：应用管理、活动监视、后台管理

@huhuhang：在使用 Mac 处理工作时，往往需要打开非常多的应用，但同时也会拖慢系统性能。此外，像我这样有一些「强迫症」的人，总是喜欢把暂时不用的应用一一手动退出。

Quit All 这款主打应用退出痛点的小工具非常实用，你可以把它理解成 Mac 自带「活动监视器」的易用版本。它支持从菜单栏非常方便地退出当前正在运行的应用，或者「一键退出」全部应用。同时，Quit All 提供了过滤后台应用、不弹出退出确认框等个性化选项。一键退出不仅可以满足强迫症，还能够有下班仪式感，每天下班时我都会执行 Quit All。

除了 Quit All，顺带推荐一下应用退出小工具 Quitter。Quitter 和知名播客客户端 Overcast 是同一个开发者。Quitter 主打定时退出，对于处于未激活状态的应用，你可以设置自动退出倒计时。Quitter 对于低频应用特别实用，避免我们忘记手动退出。有了 Quit All 和 Quitter 的完美搭配，退出应用变得无比轻松。

                    <span>10 月的某天，我家楼下的布告栏贴了一张通知，告知住户 10 月 18 日小区要停电一天。虽然此前这种事情也曾发生过，但是也就是停一会儿而已，所以我也就没拿当回事。然而，这次停电持续了将近一整天，在我黑灯瞎火地做饭的时候，我真真切切地感受到电已经渗透到生活的方方面面，没有电是万万不能的（事后了解到，这次是涉及小区供电的一个变压器调整）。这次停电的「阴影」之大，直接唤醒了我儿时的停电记忆。
曾经的停电记忆
在《沿海地区的山珍漫游指南：盘点家乡那些奇怪的美食》一文中，我曾简要地介绍过我老家的一些情况。在细聊限电应对措施之前，我想先聊聊我小时候见过、用过的那些「原始」的应对停电的方案。
因为电力紧张（或者村民们拖欠电费），我儿时经常会遇到停电。每当停电的时候，我经常会点起火油（煤油）灯，火油的那股味道挥之不去。除了火油灯，也有用瓦斯灯（电石灯）的。伴随着忽闪忽闪的火油灯，我经常在微光下赶作业。再到后来，遇到停电的时候用起了蓄电池的灯。这就是之前应对停电时照明的措施。
除了照明受影响，停电其实对于我们日常的饮食、取暖影响其实并不算大。
作为一个深处胶东腹地的山村，我们当地日常的燃料主要是苹果树的枝条及各种作物的秸秆藤蔓，「果木炭烤」再平常不过了。农村烧火做饭顶多用一下鼓风机来助燃（有些家庭甚至还在使用传统的、节能环保的风箱），所以停电时候把鼓风机变成用扇子扇，不影响炭火正常燃烧。
每家每户必备的取暖设备则是火炕。火炕可以将灶台做饭时产生的多余热量引导至炕内，用来给室内供暖。虽然现在很多人家里使用上了液化气、添置了土暖气、空调，但火炕始终是一个标配。因此，停电对于取暖的影响也算不上大，除了极少数喜好电热毯的人。
胶东地区民居中很常见的火炕，利用厨房余热取暖
停电也不影响村里供水。村民们的日常用水来自井水，而且每家都有一个储水用的大水缸，所以几乎不存在停水一说。
整体上来讲，停电对于传…</span>

                    <span>正所谓「硬件是基建，软件生产力」，在软件正版化理念逐渐成为主流的当下，免费好用的「开源」软件也成了不少人的选择。对于个人用户来说，使用开源软件有如下优势：

更便宜：降低软件授权费用，节约使用成本；
更安全：相对于闭源的软件来说，我们无法看到其内部代码，对个人隐私的顾虑只能依靠软件厂商的诚信度和法规，而开源软件公开了源代码，就算我们自己不会看，也会有其他程序员朋友帮助甄别筛选，相对更可靠一些；
更稳定：本文介绍的软件大部分是比较老牌的软件，持续运营多年具有稳定性。

作为已经过了「不当家不知柴米油盐」年纪的普通用户，应对当前大势所趋的订阅及超前消费的方式就是选择适合自己的开源软件。其次，作为折腾软件十余年但不会编程的「玩家」，天然对开源软件有亲切感，非常喜欢这种奔着相对纯粹目的完善能够造福更多人的工具。
最后，「实用为王」能够解决实际问题且符合自己使用习惯的开源软件会作为我的首选。本人日常工作生活主要用到 Windows 和 macOS 平台，偶尔还需要折腾 Linux。本文本着「完全无需付费，也能很好用」这一原则，我挑选了个人使用过的 18 款开源软件分享给大家。
文本工具
Simplenote：跨平台文本收集工具

平台: Windows / macOS / Linux / 移动端

当你想要快速记录稍纵即逝的灵感时，肯定不会喜欢需要繁琐操作步骤才能记录或者启动缓慢的 App。如果能够更进一步，能够把随时随地记录自动同步或聚合就更好了。为了实现这一目标，我试用了多款收费及开源工具，最终保留了 Simplenote 作为主力碎片文本收集和同步工具。相比其他软件，Simplenote 具备如下优势：

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

前言
在日常使用中我们会因为种种原因，从各种地方保存图片、动图和视频，而在 iOS 的默认 App「照片」中，它们大部分时候都会被存放在同一个文件夹——系统相册中。虽然有的 App 会独立创建文件夹，但那对于日常使用和相册管理来说只是杯水车薪，你的系统相册里还是十分混乱。
相册内容之多，靠手动的 Slidebox 已经拯救不了了
我在 2017 年转到 iOS 之前一直是个安卓用户，当时用的手机会默认把「相机相册」和剩下全部图片分开储存，在我眼中是一个很好甚至必须的功能。从逻辑上也更加合理：保存的图片与拍摄的照片本就是不同的内容，自然要保存到不同的位置。
将照片独立出来的好处不止分类，在翻看相册时也会拥有更好的体验，在看着照片触动回忆时不会被无关的图片干扰。值得一提的是，iOS 的「照片」里其实是有分类的，遗憾的是「媒体类型」中从视频到动图的 11 个分类里，没有一个是「相机相册」。
系统相册自带的分类功能
虽然如此，我们还可以用苹果自己在 Mac 端的工具「智能相簿」，曲线救国凭空造出一个「相机相册」出来。
正文
通过 iCloud 照片和 Mac 端「照片」App 在独有的「智能相簿」功能，可以在苹果设备创建一个所谓的「相机相册」。方法如下：
1. 左侧分栏——相簿——点击加号
Mac版「照片」App 的边栏
2. 新建智能相册——条件——相机型号——包括——iPhone。
如果曾拥有多部 iPhone手机（如曾用 iPhone 8 现用 iPhone 13）选择 iPhone 会将系列的照片全部包括
如果手机里有其他设备（如 iPad，单反相机或其他手机）拍摄的照片并且也希望保存的话，重复第二步，将最后的 「iPhone」改为相机型号，分别建立智能相簿。
3. 因为系统会把你在 iPhone 上的屏幕截图认定为是 iPhone 拍摄的照片，所以我们需要给智能相簿再添加一个条件：
光圈——在范围内——ƒ/1.8至ƒ/32（即全部范围）
因为屏幕截图和保存的图片不会带有光圈信息，所以这一条可以过滤掉手机中无关的保存图片
4. 当所有相机型号的智能相簿都被建立后，仿照第一步新建一个普通相簿，将之前建立的几个「智能相簿」拖拽进去。 合并成一个完整的相簿。
编注：在 Mac 上创建的「智能相簿」不会 显示 在 iPhone 或 iPad 上的「照片」中，因此需要第四步以及后续维护。
5. 现在，你终于有了你本就该有的「相机相册」。
6. 因为第四步中合并出的「完整相簿」并非智能相簿，所以它需要不定期更新。方法也很简单：想起来的时候顺手把装着 iPhone 照片的智能相簿（第二步创建的相册）再拖进「完整相簿」就可以完成更新，新的照片会被添加，旧的照片不会重复。
尾声
第一次在少数派写文章，如有疏忽漏洞还敬请谅解，欢迎在评论区讨论话题与指出问题。
感谢老麦点赞我的微博想法，不然我也不会完善我的想法并把文章出来。其实契机只是自己整理相册的时候被气得忍无可忍了还搜不到教程而已。
虽说绕了一大圈终于把心心念念的相机相册弄了出来，但如此基本的设置苹果没有做还是很让人沮丧，还是希望苹果早日浪子回头。

                    <span>开发者来强答一波
《物理世界》的灵感诞生于CIGA Game Jam 2019上。
当时的题目是一张这样的图片：



（看到图片的我亿脸蒙蔽XD）
但没办法，题还是要做的哇，所以我就在想，这爱心到底怎么插入小人中奖的三角形？

一般正常情况下看到这个问题，肯定是会想到“父母的爱对孩子来说太沉重”，“看起来好的东西不一定适合自己”一类的观点，但可能是我苦于物理荼毒久已，导致我第一时间想到的事居然是——

爱心通过怎样的形态变化能成为三角形，最终契合进小人的内心？我脑内闪过了一万个公式，发现都没有办法解决我的疑惑。
进而，我联想到了《Baba is you》——一款通过不同的组合方式产生不同的效果，最终解决谜题的作品。




虽然和物理世界不尽相同，但通过不同组合方式，改变角色行动逻辑，最终让角色成功移动到终点的解谜内核触动了我。彼时的我已经把题目图片抛之脑后，满脑子只想的是“我要把各种物理公式嵌进一款解谜游戏中”，让玩家再次体验被物理课堂所支配的......
就这样，初版的物理世界诞生了。

（老版本的物理世界，当时主角还不是盒娘）

尽管Game Jam很快就结束了，我们对继续制作《物理世界》的热情却丝毫没有熄灭。
首先，我们决定更换美术素材——黑板的绿底白字让人感觉过于古板，于是我们打算采用更卡通的风格让画面更有活力。


Game Jam上制作的版本中的地图的地形均为直接绘制，这不利于后续关卡的搭建和维护。我们首先换用了TileMap插件来搭建地形和绘制方块。但它的自由度不是很高，有些比较不规则的图形无法实现。于是我们又换用了更加自由的SpriteShapeController来编辑地形。


继续制作解密游戏最重要的一点就是丰富关卡内容了。为了扩充关卡内容，我们在接下来的时间里制作了更多的关卡，包括摩擦力关卡、浮力关卡、圆周运动关卡以及动量关卡。

 摩擦力关卡

浮力关卡

圆周运动关卡

动量关卡
一切关卡的设计思路以有趣为前提，为此我们也都是绞尽脑汁，不断迭代我们的作品。
当内容逐渐丰富之后，游戏主要矛盾逐渐转移到了用户的游玩体验之上。
在游玩《Baba is you》的过程中，尽管你会被他惊艳的创意所折服，但有时也会莫名其妙的过关弄昏头脑。
如果玩家与设计者的脑洞没有对上，关卡的乐趣就会骤减，原本精妙的解谜关卡设置在玩家眼中可能会“过于电波系”，让玩家一头雾水，卡关的挫败感也许会让他们不再打开这部作品。

为了解决这样的问题，在设计比较复杂的关卡的时候，我们或有意或无意地留下了多于一种的过关方式。




在这个关卡中，你可以选择黄色和紫色方块中任何一个用于垫脚

我们加入了提示系统以避免避免玩家长时间的卡关导致失去兴趣的情况出现，但于此同时，我们也不会给予玩家包办式的过关引导——玩家依然需要去考虑如何实现提示系统中的各条提示，它们一般都不会太难，只是需要花点时间。


同时，为了玩家能够更好地get到我们设计时的脑洞，我们也特地的在靠前的引导关卡中以更简单的方法呈现给玩家。

这个关卡的过关方式中需要用方块将红色小旗撞下来。
在本作最开始的测试中，许多玩家第一次看到这样的关卡时，往往无法第一时间悟到本关的解谜机制，最终会因为定式思维卡关很久。
我们注意到了这点，于是在较为前面的关卡中加入了这样的一关来进行引导。

这关需要玩家用蓝色方块将红色小旗撞下
这样一来，玩家能更容易地理解并利用这样的机制进行解密。
在游戏进行测试的过程中我们发现，有的玩家在一开始就难以理解这个游戏的机制——用物理公式来控制场上的物体。甚至在第一关就不知所措。于是我们又额外增加了教程关卡来解决这个问题。


教程关中通过文字一步步的指导，让玩家了解游戏的机制以及游玩思路——这成功地降低了游戏的上手难度，也让这部作品能够得以有机会被更多用户所看到。
一起来体验《物理世界》的美妙吧！

                    <span>屠龙勇者终成恶龙，一种循环何时结束？
注：为求简单，本文许多处会称呼索尔斯克亚为索肖。
新教练上任，欣欣向荣，一切向好，给人希望。但在执教中期，教练技战术在锐意革新与固执保守中打转。在执教末期，教练自掘坟墓式地弃用可用之人，一步步把自己宽裕的手牌变成买人不利阵容太薄。这一集，你是不是已经看过无数遍了？这样循环播放的戏码，在后弗格森时代不断上演，以致于按下快进键也不会漏掉关键剧情。
这，就是这些年的曼联。
作为球员，索尔斯克亚与曼联共同拼下过至高荣誉，也陪俱乐部一起经历过短暂重建的低谷。作为教练，他受命于危难之际，一度曾经展现过从二流向一流进化的希望，但因一念之差选择了虚假的弗格森传统，并没有搞清曾经的荣光岁月因何而成功，在自己团队本该最擅长的长期建队和进攻上不断摇摆，不断退化，最终跳水成为三流之选，并不冤枉。
以前看过我总结的朋友，这篇文章可能会出现大量你见到过的段落，就当是回顾一下往事吧。
一、什么应该是真正的弗格森理念？
这一次的文章，我们改一下顺序，首先讲明白，我们期待在弗格森以后的教练身上看到什么？要弄清楚这一点，不得不探讨：什么才是真正的弗格森理念？是全力进攻吗？是本土化吗？是坚持青训DNA吗？是前锋中卫扛大旗，边路两翼齐飞释放压力，中场只要会分边会站位就行吗？
如果你回想起弗格森懂权变、能屈能伸的战术变化，如果你回想起基恩、哈格里夫斯甚至弗莱彻短暂带来给曼联的腰板，如果你回想起范佩西、贝尔巴托夫、维迪奇、埃弗拉、年轻版C罗甚至争议极大的特维斯、范尼斯特鲁伊、基恩等等外来球员带来的比赛场面，恐怕你很难认同上述的任何一条。可惜的是，这些有争议的弗格森理念，一条不落地被现任曼联教练组奉若圭臬。
弗格森真正的理念是什么？我妄自揣摩，只有一个字，就是“赢”。如果用两个字形容的话，就是“求胜”。用更多字形容的话，就是管你用什么方法，怎么能赢怎么来。
具体体现形式是：战术和临…</span>

                    <span>车田宇宙中如此文艺范儿，且带有一定现实意义的作品实属稀有。随中华风飘荡，空气中还弥漫着浓浓的欧洲文艺气息。


本作最终BOSS 机械皇帝，可以说是效仿文艺复兴，实施了他的人类复兴。也就是他追求的人类再生『Human Renaissance』。


但在他眼里的文艺复兴，如同办家家酒已被贬得一文不值，根本不配冠以复兴之名。



机械皇帝制造的 B’T ，其原型是他在卫星内培养的人工生命体（Homunculus）！


Homunculus  的制法本就是文艺复兴时期的炼金术师所著。


这些被培养的细胞，又都被冠以了文艺复兴时期的众多天才之名。









其中孵化成功的仅有ラファエロ。音译有拉法罗或拉法尔。但此名字也正是文艺复兴后三杰中拉斐尔的名字。


机械皇帝距今700 多年前就已存在。因为十六世纪中期，他在佛罗伦萨遇到娜夏与米夏的时候，就已经存活了200年以上。






追溯回去，他出生以及成长的时期，正是处于文艺复兴的十四世纪。


▽
或许是他拥有远远超出常人的才华，其理想在当时的世人看来，是如此荒唐，亦或被当作邪道。


即便是现在，想必也难以苟同。


但他对此的反馈是『对超出认知的东西，人们往往都会用恶魔来定义』。



人类的生命无永恒，可看作是被神所分配的行使权利。对于机械皇帝来说，或许这就是一种『封建制度』。


他毅然的举起了反『封建』的新文明运动的旗帜。只为创造一个他所谓的理想世界，一个以他为神的永生世界。


作为对抗机械皇帝的力量，首当其冲的是以中国神话四灵为模型的存在。


想必在ACG中，四神更为常见，且出境率更高也更讲究方位。



为何选择四灵不得而知。但四灵为瑞兽，有吉祥之兆，这或许是在暗示，四灵是为人类带来稳定吉祥的象征吧。


四灵又以麒麟为首，麒麟现身，也就代表了盛世安康。这可能也是，为什么麒麟是主角的原因之一。

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
This series is inspired by Wadzee and Luke TheNoteable Hardcore Minecraft Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it&#x27;s actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.

Introduction
Shaders
Setup
Shader Code
Conclusion
For those of you who love rabbit holes, learning graphics programming is a pretty deep one. There’s always some new thing to learn, there’s a bunch of different new languages and toolsets to know, and on top of all that, there’s math. Like anything else in programming, you pick up momentum with each new thing you build, so I found a tutorial and started making shaders. I know very little about this. However, I’m writing what I’m learning, so don’t come for me if I’m off on anything. 



A shader is a program that runs on the GPU as part of the graphics pipeline. We’re going to focus primarily on shaders in Unity. There are other ways to tackle this, but Unity gives an easy setup to get started quickly. For the context o…</span>

                    <span>Over two years ago (gulp), I posted a walkthrough of my Rust implementation of todo-mvp by @gypsydave5
 demonstrating how to build a simple Rust API without a framework.  The core functionality was built using hyper, a lower-level HTTP library instead of a full-blown framework.
It turns out I wrote that post about six months too early.  I published it in May 2019, and in November, Rust released 1.39.0 containing async/await syntax.  Womp womp.
My intent here was to simply upgrade the existing application to use the new syntax where applicable and call it a day.  But, you know that thing that happens when you go back and review code you wrote years ago?  Yeah, that thing happened. 
Our result functions almost identically to the implementation in the previous post, so some of this code will …</span>

When I did start bothering about it... what was my surprise when everywhere I saw they would just resize the screen and call it a day.
Granted, it was usually because one thing was being explained and most of the time... it will be enough...
Sometimes just resizing your desktop browser isn&#x27;t enough... you have to use it on the real thing.
And if that&#x27;s the case... what if I told you, you could have your desktop debugging experience in your phone? 
On your Android device, enable debugging


See more here: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options





Connect your phone and desktop by USB
Go to: chrome://inspect#devices

???
Profit?

To learn more: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/
If you&#x27;re having trouble connecting, try unplugging and replugging it (seriously), also make sure &quot;Discover USB devices&quot; is checked.
After it&#x27;s on, you can click inspect or even open new tabs!

And you probably want to set up the port you&#x27;ll be using to be forwarded.

And that&#x27;s it!
You have the full experience of debugging straight from Chrome
If you use it from the phone, it&#x27;s reflected in the inspect window.
If you use it from the inspect window, it will reflect on the phone.

But that&#x27;s not all, some of the programming languages I will create for purpose of this series. So if you follow along, you&#x27;ll see not just a lot of different programming languages, but you might also learn a thing or two about how to create your own.
I won&#x27;t be shy about my opinions, and I might be even exaggerating a bit. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.
Episodes will all be indepedent. Target audience is people who know programming, but don&#x27;t know a 100 difference languages, so I&#x27;ll often use some less idiomatic ways of doing things if I think it&#x27;s clea…</span>

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It helps us to write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it&#x27;s mostly used as a state management tool with React.

Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our s…</span>

I spent this weekend playing around with Scala.js and learning how to manipulate browser cookies with it.
Check out the live demo at cookies.awwsmm.com.
The source is available at github.com/awwsmm/CookiesScalaJS.
There are a few cool Scala flairs here, particularly this bit which pattern matches on a regular expression
  def clearAllCookies(): Unit &#x3D; {
    val Cookie &#x3D; &quot;([^&#x3D;]+)&#x3D;.+&quot;.r
    document.cookie.split(&quot;; &quot;).foreach {
      case Cookie(key) &#x3D;&gt; clearCookie(key)
      case other &#x3D;&gt; err.println(s&quot;Couldn&#x27;t parse &#x27;$other&#x27; as a key&#x3D;value cookie pair&quot;)
    }
  }

In order to ensure that users don&#x27;t include the ; or &#x3D; characters in their cookie keys and values (which confuses the parser), I&#x27;ve also added these two little safeguards, as well
    // prevent the user from typing &#x27;;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; into the input
    input.addEventListener(&quot;keypress&quot;, (e: dom.KeyboardEvent) &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (e.key &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;;&quot; || e.key &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;&#x3D;&quot;) {
        e.preventDefault()
      }
    })

    // prevent the user from pasting &#x27;;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; into the input
    input.addEventListener(&quot;paste&quot;, (e: dom.ClipboardEvent) &#x3D;&gt; {
      val text &#x3D; e.clipboardData.getData(&quot;text&quot;)
      if (text.contains(&quot;;&quot;) || text.contains(&quot;&#x3D;&quot;)) {
        e.preventDefault()
      }
    })

What do you think? Anyone else on DEV doing anything cool with Scala.js?</span>

Typescript is superset of Javascript which means it is an extension of Javascript, adding new features and syntax on top of the core language.
Typescript is a strongly typed, object-oriented &amp; compiled language.
Typescript is designed to be compiled into fully compatible Javascript, so it works in any browser, any host, and any OS. 
We need typescript compiler to compile it to Javascript code because browsers do not understand typescript.
Typescript strongly encouraged static-typing which means it will validate all the assertions before the code executes. It allows you to do a type check during…</span>

                    <span>After months of hard work, I have finally released my NFT collection called Extravagant Whales. 
At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about NFTs, but the more I dived into the NFT world, the more I was convinced about finishing my collection.
NFTs are unique tokens which can be images, videos, audio files, and any other types of digital files. NFTs are deployed on the blockchain and use blockchain technology to generate a public proof of ownership.
I didn&#x27;t create my NFTs for the money or the fame of being recognized. I did it for the learning process and what&#x27;s behind creating NFTs.
I&#x27;m not an artist, so I used programming and some tools which were already created by some awesome people such as Daniel Eugene Botha (HashLips) and Rounak Banik (Scrappy Squirrels) to generate my collection. I did c…</span>

Some familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.
Arrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.
The Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.
Below is a typical example of how the filter function is used:
var arr1 &#x3D; [1,2,3,4],
    arr2 &#x3D; [2,4],
    res &#x3D; arr1.filter(item &#x3D;&gt; !arr2.includes(item));

console.log(res);

When this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array.

这篇文章从“五种特性”的角度向大家介绍我的Marginnote-Zotero学术写作工作流，Applescript脚本、Alfred插件以及Obsidian插件是连通这两样工具的桥梁。
我希望从阅读、摘录、整理、成稿的整个环节全面补齐Marginnote在学术写作方面的短板。有了Zotero的支持，Marginnote不再是无根之木、无源之水，而是处处有据可考、处处有证可依的内容发掘工厂与思维孵化器。。你可以在一个笔记本中绑定多篇pdf进行专题性的文献阅读，也可以先使用子脑图划分不同出处的摘录，最后再通过引用卡片，在新的框架中迭代整合，进而获得获得系统性的梳理文稿。
过去的“边写边引”变成“自动识别引用”、“自动生成参考文献列表”，阅读时分神来回切换阅读器和文献管理工具进行参阅和引用彻底成为过去式。以Markdown为载体的写作更专注于内容，结合Obsidian的Pandoc插件一键完成优雅的终稿排版。

                    <span>不少读者可能会有同时使用多个浏览器的习惯，比如在 Windows 上使用 Microsoft Edge、在 macOS 上使用 Safari、在移动端则使用 Chrome。在这种使用场景下，实现不同浏览器之间的书签同步也是个不小的需求——毕竟书签内容往往会随着我们的浏览行为发生变化，每次切换平台、浏览器都进行一次导出、导入还是比较麻烦。
作为一个多平台、多浏览器都在使用的用户，在今天的文章中我将分享一些能够在不同浏览器之间实现书签同步的解决方案。
Chrome、Edge 以及 Firefox 的书签同步
在桌面端，基于 Chromium 内核的浏览器（主要是 Chrome、Edge）与 Firefox 因为都有着丰富的扩展生态支持，因此也可以通过浏览器扩展来实现书签管理与同步。
个人比较推荐的是以下两款：
xBrowserSync
如果你想要开箱即用的多浏览器书签同步服务，最佳选择就是 xBrowserSync。
这款工具支持的浏览器包括 Firefox 以及各种基于 Chromium 的浏览器，只需在对应浏览器的扩展商店中搜索 xBrowserSync 并安装即可。

在扩展中点击 xBrowserSync 开始设置同步，直接点击 next 然后会让你输入对应的密码——之后服务会自动生成一个同步 ID，默认同步的服务器为主服务器，当然 xBrowserSync 也提供多个镜像同步服务器（服务器列表）方便我们进行选择，你可以根据具体的网络情况点击下方的 Switch Service 来切换到更为稳定的服务器。

输入两遍密码之后，你当前浏览器的书签会以书签文件的形式自动同步到 xBrowserSync 服务器中。点击扩展程序栏中的 xBrowserSync 图标，你可以对书签进行管理，设定相关的同步服务。比如对在线书签进行搜索、添加当前标签页为书签等等。

在系列的第三期文章《玩转 Obsidian 03：如何记录「间歇式日记」》中介绍过如何通过「间歇式日记」管理自己的日常工作和生活：

「间歇式日记」是著名的生产力教练 Coach Tony 在2017 年发表的《Replace Your To-Do List With Interstitial Journaling To Increase Productivity》文章中提出的一个概念。他认为「间歇式日记」可以更好的帮助自己集中精力更聪明的工作。「间歇式日记」既不同于常规的「日记」，也不同于常规的「任务管理软件」，它更强调围绕着「工作流」打造一个「正反馈描述」从而提高「生产力」。

「间歇式日记」的运作方式其实很简单，一句话总结：

在每个「工作间歇」，以「时间戳」为单位，采用类似「日记」的形式做的笔记。

在实际使用中「间歇式日记」也不会有太多负担，因为适当总结和梳理总是会帮助我们「理清现状」并开始下一个行动。但是，在使用「间歇式日记」一段时间后我发现了几个问题。
间歇式日记的问题
问题1：笔记优先法则 Vs 文件夹管理
在《玩转 Obsidian 04：为什么推荐使用 Obsidian 做知识管理》文章中专门提到 Obsidian 遵循「笔记优先法则」，这是它的优势之一：
笔记优先法则
「笔记优先法则」要求我们我们完全不需要考虑文件「存到哪里」这件事，只需要关注文件的「双向链接」以及 Tag 即可。并且借助 Obsidian 强大的搜索和关联能力，我们可以很方便的找到各种笔记。
在实际使用场景中，每天的「间歇式日记」经常要关联…</span>

                    <span>The Nintendo Switch OLED model is the fancy new toy in town, and it’s a big improvement over the original Nintendo Switch from 2017. That new OLED display makes a huge difference, making colors more vibrant and deeper blacks, it makes a huge difference in the way games look. If you’re buying a Switch this

                    <span>For a lot of useful State Related Hooks, Checkout my Library merced-react-hooks
To quick setup application wide state in your app just make a file called src/GlobalState.js in your react app.
GlobalState.js
import { useState, createContext, useContext } from &quot;react&quot;

// The initial state, you can setup any properties initilal values here.
const initialState &#x3D; {
    count: 0
}

// create the context object for delivering your state across your app.
const GlobalContext &#x3D; createContext(null)

// custom component to provide the state to your app
export const GlobalState &#x3D; props &#x3D;&gt; {
  // declare the GlobalState
  const [globalState, setGlobalState] &#x3D; useState({})

  // create a function that&#x27;ll make it easy to update one state property at a time
  const updateGlobalState &#x3D; (key, newValue) &#x3D;&gt; {
    setGlobalState(oldState &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (oldState[key] !&#x3D;&#x3D; newValue) {
        const newState &#x3D; { ...oldState }
        newState[key] &#x3D; newValue
        return newState
      } else {
        return oldState
      }
    })
  }

  return (
    {props.children}
  )
}

// custom hook for retrieving the provided state
export const useGlobalState &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; useContext(GlobalContext)

then you just have wrap your application with the GlobalState component in index.js

    


then in any component you can use the state. Below is an example of a counter component using the GlobalState.
import {useGlobalState} from &quot;../GlobalState.js&quot;

function Counter(props){

    const [globalState, updateGlobalState] &#x3D; useGlobalState()

    return 
{globalState.count}
 updateGlobalState(&quot;count&quot;, globalState.count + 1)}&gt;Add One
     updateGlobalState(&quot;count&quot;, globalState.count - 1)}&gt;Subtract One
    

}

There you go, now you can share state across your app in an easy that you can customize to your needs.</span>

                    <span>When you are working on a project, it is very useful to know the history of the modifications using git. If you are coding on Visual Studio Code like me, you should activate git blame by following these steps :
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Press Ctrl+Shift+X (windows) or ⇧⌘X (Mac)
- Type blame
- Click install on Git Blame
Now, you can see at the bottom of the vs code window who is responsible for the line of code you have your cursor on, as you can see on the image below: line 37 Sara Ounissi (that would be me), pushed this code 1 day ago.

However, the aim of this option is not just to see who wrote the code, but why and when. You can click on the name of the person, this will open a pop-in, the button View will then redirect you to the git repository where you will see the whole modification, the name of the commit, etc… Hopefully, that will help you get more context.</span>

So every now and then i see something that catches my eye. Recently that seems to be Linux Distributions, over the last few months i have changed my distribution&#x27;s a few times to try and find one i&#x27;m comfortable with. I moved from my iMac (getting a bit sluggish) to Ubuntu originally and it worked but i didn&#x27;t &quot;enjoy it&quot;, i then tried Manjaro, then Pop!_OS and then finally thought id have a go with Elementary OS.
So far i am really enjoying it! it feels a bit &quot;Mac&#x27;ish&quot;, Looks nice and feels quick!
But compared to Ubuntu its a little bit different with the Setup of the dev environment, so i thought id write up a little tutorial on setting a Laravel Dev Environment on Elementary OS.
So as with any tutorial i do with Linux, we start with an update/upgrade.

                    <span>Node.JS is a technology that has transformed JavaScript, which is familiar to all web developers, from a client-side scripting language to a general-purpose language that has a large number of application use cases.
 
At the heart of how Node works.js is asynchronous. In addition to non-blocking I / O, this allows a server-side application on Node.js can handle much more client requests per unit of time than a similar application developed on most other server-side development technologies.
What does this mean for your business?
You can start your own project with relatively low costs for the server infrastructure.
With the right architecture, this allows you to scale your business without investing a lot of money.

                    <span>First let us get over with the debate of Authentication vs Authorization.
It is the process to verify if the user is telling the truth. For example: when we log into our account with some username and password, the process of verifying those credentials with the stored information in database and knowing that the user is really whom he/she claims to be is called Authentication.
It is a security process to know what information user has access to. Giving someone permission to download a particular file on a server or providing individual users with administrative access to an application are good examples of authorization.
In this article we are going to look into two different methods of User Authentication with NodeJS
Sesssion Based Authentication
Token Based Authentication

                    <span>(This was a talk at The ephemeral miniconf, here are the slides)
Once upon a time, 
a guy named Larry Wall 
created a language called Perl.

He became the BDFL 
of this PL 
which values are TIMTOWTDI, 
DWIM, 
POLA 
and as all UNIXes: 
KISS 
and DOTADIW.

Perl enhances some key concepts 
of AWK, 
SED 
or GREP 
and even provides ACK 
and leads industry standard REGEX 
(PCRE).

PPL started to ❤️ Perl, 
meeting in PM groups 
and calling themself JAPH.

Eventually, big-sized meetings appeared 
like YAPC, 
TPC 
and TPRCIC 
(or chartreuse-sized ones like PTS).

There were also associations 
like TPF 
or EPO 
and individuals 
like YOU 
and ME.

FYI in 2021, 
I decided to organize TEM 
because hey, YOLO!

Technically speaking, 
you can say Perl 
or perl 
but not PERL 
nor the horrific PEARL... 😱

And if you don&#x27;t know, 
go on IRC 
and ask PURL! 🤖 

People say 
&quot;Only perl can parse Perl&quot; 
but there is PPI, 
PPR 
and PLS.

Interfacing w/ native extensions is easy 
with FFI, 
XS, 
SWIG 
or WASM 
(and even easier with NCI in Raku).

Perl lovers contribute 
to the CPAN w/ ❤️  
via PAUSE 
so Perl users can use CPANP, 
CPANM 
or CPM 
to DRY.

You can browse MetaCPAN 
for DBI, 
EUMM, 
MB, 
LWP 
or PDL 
or even some idiot ACME.

Each DIST 
contains a whole lot of DOC 
in a format named POD 
and even a dedicated RT Q.

If you&#x27;re in trouble, 
have a look at HOP 
or PBP.

IMHO 
it is a good PPT, 
but maybe a bit WTF... 
IDK 🤷
THX for attending 
and FWIW 
here is a well deserved GIF.

There are many pages wich explain what the Spread Operator (also know as three dots) and Rest Parameters are. 
It is an operator that I really like and I would like to share with you some ways that I use it.
📓 Spread Operator
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (print as array)

When we use the spread operator we get the values ​​independently:
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( ...numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; 1 2 3 4

Add an array to another:
let customers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27; ];
let otherCustomers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ];

customers.push( ...otherCustomers );
console.log( customers );

While 5250 green screens are effective, they don’t provide the rich UX-based experience users demand from modern software applications. In addition, because of the knowledge gap and dwindling talent pool of IBM i developers, most organizations run on multiple computing systems.

水一篇
这个应该是今年最后一篇文章了，卷累了打算明年在卷了。
年中的时候帮部门招人，发现很多候选人对于我们部门还是很青睐的。也对鸡架部门做的事比较感兴趣，所以今天这篇水文主要就给大家梳理下基架的面试题以及基础架构组涉及的sdk相关。
因为最近几年面试经常被人吊打，所以也有了总结面试题的习惯。之后加上之前帮候选人的面试总结，今天给大家再卷一波。
也不是别的啥就是想要毛面试题的流量了呢。
SDK相关
面试的时候我觉得哦，这些sdk有任意其实你研究的比较深入就行了，应该能在面试中表现的很好了。还有就是个人建议最好还是在单一方向研究的更深入一点，别的只要大概知道干什么的就行了。
配置中心以及灰度测试
app必备工具之一，配置中心主要负责的就是动态化的配置，比如文本展示类似这些的。sdk提供方需要负责的是提供动态更新能力，这里有个差异化更新，只更新dif部分，还有就是流量优化等等需要开发同学考虑的。然后可以考虑下存储性能方面的提升等。
而abtest也是app必备工具之一了，动态的下发实验策略，之后开发同学可以切换实验的页面。另外主要需要考虑灰度结果计算，分桶以及版本过滤白名单等等。这里只是一个简单的介绍不展开，因为我只是一个使用方。
调试组件
个人还是更推荐滴滴的Dokit，功能点比较多而且接入相对来说比较简单。而且提供了很多给开发同学定制的能力，可以在debug情况下增加很多业务相关的测试功能，方便测试同学，核心还是浮窗太方便了。
当然很多实验性的预研功能等其实都可以直接接在这里，然后在测试环境下充分展开，之后在进行线上灰度方案。还有一些具有风险的hook操作，个人也比较建议放在debug组件上。
性能监控框架
这部分有几个不同的方面，首先是异常崩溃方面的，另外则是性能监控方面的，但是他们整体是划分在一起的，都属于线上性能监控体系的。

                    <span>掐指算来，Apple 正式将其桌面端设备的系统架构从 X86 转移到 ARM 也已经有一年左右的时间。这个过程之中 Apple 不仅通过 Rosetta 2 巧妙地解决了原来 X86 应用的兼容性问题，与此同时越来越多的应用开发商也适时地更新应用加入了对 Apple silicon 的原生支持。但对应的则是硬件架构上带来的封闭——虽然提供了所谓的一整套虚拟化实现接口，但一年多来支持 Apple silicon 的虚拟化软件却屈指可数。
作为 Mac 平台上较为老牌的商业虚拟化软件，VMware Fusion 在推进基于 M1 架构 Mac 虚拟机应用的进展却一直不快，一直到 2021 年 9 月才推出了首个技术预览版。再对比今年四月初就已推出基于 M1 架构正式版虚拟化软件的 Parallels Desktop，VMware Fusion 对于个人用户而言最大的优势可能就是免费了。
VMware Fusion 更新之后，我也在第一时间下载了 VMware Fusion 首个基于 M1 架构技术测试版，来看看这款商业虚拟化软件在 M1 架构下的表现如何。
能安装哪些系统
因为基于 ARM64 架构，因此和 Parallels Desktop 类似，VMware Fusion for Apple silicon Public Tech Preview 也只支持同架构下的系统模拟。也就是说，安装的虚拟机系统也必须是基于 ARM64 的。
但相比 Parallels Desktop 官方原生支持 Windows ARM64，VMware Fusion for Apple silicon Public Tech Preview 明确说明将不会「官方」支持 ARM64 架构的 Windows 系统，仅支持基于 ARM64 的 Linux 发行套件。官方给出的解释则是微软并没有推出零售版…</span>

天气渐渐转凉，吃得也比以前多了起来。但吃归吃，还是不希望自己发胖或影响身体健康。接触「Locabo Diet 低糖质饮食」的概念有一段时间，也进行了相关尝试，但因为我并不是会做饭的人，所以想分享一下市面上就能轻松购买到的相关好物。只需简单的替换，就能减少许多糖和热量的摄入。
什么是 Locabo，什么是糖质
Locabo 严格意义上是日本一个 健康协会 的登录商标，名称来源于 low-carbohydrate（低碳水饮食），但观念有所不同，他们不提倡极端控制碳水，而是适量、健康、美味地进行摄取，因此称自己为 Locabo。

糖质指的是碳水化合物中去除不参与代谢的食物纤维，其他的能参与代谢、产生能量的部分。

Locabo 协会认为现代人饮食中摄取的糖质太多了。一餐饭中，两个饭团+一杯蔬果汁就有 100 g 糖质，而健康的糖质摄取量应该为一餐 20-40 g，再加上加餐 10 g，一天的摄入量应该控制在 70-130 g 之间。
为此，需要做到：1. 米饭半碗；2. 多吃菜、鱼、肉；3. 使用低糖质的甜味剂代替砂糖。综合实践下来，采用低糖质替代品来减糖还是相对容易的，但减少主食的摄入量可能不那么容易，尤其是胃口大的人。不过不要紧，我们可以采用 Locabo 的部分理念来践行减糖活动。
万变不离其宗：无热量甜味剂取代砂糖
少数派作者的 这篇文章 中，「甜味剂的分类和无糖的概念」这一节，介绍了生活中常见的甜味剂。有些甜味剂使用少量即可产生强效甜味，但热量极低，可以作为糖的良好替代品。生活中会用到糖，主要是饮品（如奶茶）、烹饪（如糖醋菜…</span>

                    <span>Even though Apple is slowly migrating from the Lightning port to USB Type-C, many of its older and existing devices still use the Lightning port for charging and data transfer. And the company supplies a Lightning cable with pretty much every product that needs it, but Apple cables are notoriously flimsy and very often break.

                    <span>大家好，我是游戏的作者炒饭。
发布的这个星期情绪波动很大，补了一个长觉到现在终于缓过来了。
到现在为止，游戏卖了大概两万份，很多很多了
虽然距离回本还有距离（抱歉，我烧太多）但希望还是有的。


至于怎么评价自己的游戏，现在还没办法说。
目前的状态很像刚刚考完试的学生，对一切还是懵的。
做项目很像考试，不同的环节是不同的题。


有些题你有把握，做的很顺畅；有的题没把握，瞎写了个答案。
有的题目不会但你蒙对了，有些题本来可以对粗心做错了。
还有些题呢，超出了你的能力范畴，想蒙个答案都不知道怎么写。


反正现在成绩出来了，分数还行。
之前做好了不及格的准备，做好了暴死的准备。
后路也准备好了，简历写了好几份，打工的地方也联系过。
现在看来……虽然中间一波三折，但暂时应该不用去打工了。


回过头看去，项目里问题很多，
系统的，设计上的，剧本里节奏的，人物设计上的都有。
还有大家很诟病的结局，结尾的都合降神，段子太多建政水平低，
这些问题无法辩驳，狡辩找理由也没啥意义。


借口也好找——受限于时间也受限于水平，
就像考试的时候遇到难题，超出了你的水平和知识储备，
这种题你只能强行答，答完了检查多少遍，也未必能改对。


接着往下说估计又要开始哭穷了，说点梦想啊之类的场面话，
但这两年大家都不容易，谁都穷，谁也都有梦想。
与其说那些，不如说点更有意思的。


其实最早这是个卖萌的游戏，篇幅很短（2-3小时时长），
当时手上钱不多，做外包垫了一些钱回不来，不敢做规模大的企划。
正好去日本旅游（购物旅行团）了几天，认识了很多做代购的大妈，
那几天梦见自己去阴间做代购，代购什么黄泉化妆品孟婆汤阴间树叶。
后来就根据这个写了个小故事，男主角是个骗子，骗了个兔子精去做代购。
故事也没啥主题，就是纯卖萌，日常，搞笑，带点小温馨。


然后剧本我刚开了个头，疫情来了。作为武汉人很崩溃。

  What is Open edX® ?


Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:
Ansible Playbooks which has 1 or multiple roles. Imaging Playbook as full instructions on how to install your software, it&#x27;s components and how the set them up to work properly.
Ansible Roles. Each component in your stack has it&#x27;s own role. for example if your are using Djang…</span>

                    <span>Looking back...


Last week in class we added automated testing to our Static Site Generators (mine is called textToHTML). This included some tests for Jest which make sure the core functionality of our programs work as expected.
After writing our tests, if you run npm run test from the command line it will run the tests. But... what if someone who is contributing to your repository forgets to run the tests before committing? 
Introducing continuous integration (I&#x27;m using the GitHub version). 
This allows you to set up a .github folder containing a .yml file to configure your tests to run automatically on any push or pull request to your repository. The above linked article shows step by step how to set up the configuration folder and file for either Node.js or Python.

                    <span>YouTube is testing changes in its platform that could affect one of the most classic indicators about the temperature of a video: dislikes. From their Twitter account they explained that these are some new design changes in which the amount of dislikes on videos will not be shown, but curiously the button will remain there.
At the moment, YouTube says that this will be a &quot;small experiment&quot; that some users may see during the next few weeks. However, creators will still be able to see the exact number of &#x27;likes&#x27; and &#x27;dislikes&#x27; from YouTube Studio.
The equivalent of &quot;review bombing&quot; on YouTube, these are campaigns where users go en masse to click the &#x27;dislike&#x27; button on a video. YouTube says it has implemented this change after talking to creators who have been victims of such campaigns.

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Nov. 18th, we had our first Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 1. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.
How do you currently collect user experience data?
What works well with your approach? 
What&#x27;s still challenging?
Megan Sullivan and Amber Matz both mentioned feedback widgets embedded in the docs they worked on. These widgets ask if the page was helpful. They also offer an open text field to add more comments. 
Sarah Rainsberger and I both mentioned receiving feedback from our communities directly.

                    <span>After several weeks of writings about Kubernetes, I want to write a short post about React, about libraries, because man can not live only on Kubernetes. 
These are some of the libraries that I consider most useful and cool in React. For obvious reasons, React-router, Redux, and other well-known ones are excluded. As well as some React Frameworks such as Gatsby, Nextjs, Frontity, and others.
Ant Design
Ant design is beautiful, yes, there is not much that can be deepened using text. It has tons of components that are visually pleasing and very stylish: buttons, sliders, progress bars, layouts, you know, the basics. Make sure to visit their site and see for yourself all that Ant design has to offer when you are done reading this post, of course.

Docker has quickly become an essential platform for application containerization. By empowering developers to rapidly deploy apps and host them in the cloud, Docker has simplified the dev cycle by expediting the process of building scalable, modern applications.
Docker Compose
Compose For Local Development
Docker Compose takes the convenience of containers one step further, by streamlining each service’s building and runtime config into a single process. With Compose, it’s as simple as:
Define how to build your app’s services with a 
Dockerfile
Define how to run your app’s services in the 
docker-compose.yaml
Build and run your app with docker-compose up

We have a div and inside we have a label, an input and a ul, this input will be where we will type the information and when the information matches the list we have it will be displayed in ul

本周话题：政府的存储需求有多大？
最近，有一条新闻吸引了我的注意。
美国达拉斯警察局迁移内部数据，不小心误删了 22TB 的数据，后来找回 14TB，剩下的 8TB 确认丢失。
丢失的数据里面，有一个谋杀案的所有文档、图像、视频。证据没了无法起诉，而嫌疑人又不认罪，警方正在讨论怎么办，最后很可能只能把他放了。

大家觉得上面这条新闻，什么地方值得注意？
不是误删数据，那种事情每天都在发生。我觉得，重点是警察局的数据超过了 22TB。这个容量不算小，说明它的硬盘保存了很多东西，而且应该是有一个自己的存储系统，搞不好还有机房。
达拉斯的人口是130多万，警察局的存储超过了 22TB，整个美国的人口是3亿多，你说所有警察局的存储空间加在一起，该有多大？
美国的警察局属于州政府，国家一级的治安机关是联邦调查局 FBI，它的存储恐怕更大，此外还有其他政府部门（比如国防部、财政部、中央情报局......）。这么一想，美国政府单位消耗的硬盘真是不得了，恐怕是一个天文数字。

我接着想到，中国政府单位的存储需求，也是天文数字吧。好在这可以查，政府采购需要招标，招标公告一般发布在政府采购网。

我全文搜索&quot;存储&quot;，过去半年有11431条采购公告。

各省的各种单位都有，采购金额从几十万到几百万不等，大家可以去看。我随便摘录几条。

[美剧] 黄石 第四季

关键词：剧情 / 西部
片长：50 分钟（单集）× 7 集；豆瓣链接

民风淳朴哥谭市，热情好客黄石人～

@潘誉晗：相信不少剧迷都认为《黄石》是更加现实的《西部世界》，的确，比起后者，在一个游戏世界中建立秩序寻找人性这样的设定，《黄石》是更为接近西部荒蛮却真实的存在。它包括家族、政治、不同立场之间的斗争，也不乏西部的野性和叛逆。
剧集围绕达顿家族展开，当家人约翰是坐拥全美最大牧场黄——石牧场的牧场主，而牧场得天独厚的地理位置和自身发展所带来的巨大财富，自然也引来了许多人的觊觎。比如企图把这里发展成新城市的开发商；认为这里应该属于印第安人的拥有印第安血统的政治家；还有想分一杯羹的政府。在…</span>

                    <span>在如今的日常生活中，我们总是离不开各式各样的 App。你也许并不喜欢这个 App，但往往又陷入「不得不用」的困境。你或许不知道，我们每天都在用的这些 App，它们却藏着许多实用的小功能。这篇文章就将带大家一同探寻那些每日 App 中的「隐藏操作」，希望能帮你提升这些 App 的使用体验。
小……功能做的不错的微信
提到「每日 App」，小而美微信或许是许多人又爱又恨的存在。虽然大家总在吐槽微信的各种限制，但作为「国民级 App」的它也确实有着一些鲜为人知的实用功能。
发送视频不被压缩
想必不少人都曾因微信发送视频时被压缩、损伤画质的事情而苦恼，再加上有文件大小在 100M 以内的限制，当不得不在微信传输视频文件时，我们需要借助一些外部的网盘等 App 才能实现。
在对话框中选择下方的文件，打开后在上方切换需传输的文件的位置，可以是手机相册或者是来自 iCloud（Android 则会显示为「手机存储」），即可将视频直接以「文件」的格式发送，无损画质也没有大小限制。

对于有些打工人来说，尽管非常抗拒使用微信办公，有时候也会被迫使用微信接收或者发送文件，甚至常会出现你和你的同事在飞书、企业微信等 OA 软件办公，但却需要将文件在微信上发送给老板。
虽然对于明明有 OA 但非要用微信的行为不理解，作为一个人在屋檐下的打工人却别无他法，比如我们公司，明明电脑上没有权限安装微信，却总有同事要在微信里拉群发送消息。
对于以上这种场景，用手机上的微信传送电脑文件变成了一个强需求，这时候可以先将文件传到 iCloud 云盘，再从「微信 - 文件 - iCloud」中发送，文件大小也没有限制（传输速度比百度网盘快得多），即使发送的文件为压缩包，只要手机里有安装对应的解压软件，也可以打开。

值得一提的是，iOS 上有不少应用都支持了 iCloud Drive，你可以直接在「文件」应用的「浏…</span>

It&#x27;s &#x27;normal&#x27; to be &#x27;disabled&#x27;
残疾是正常的

几乎是几周前（指相对于原文的写作时间 9 月 27 日——译注），我偶然注意到欧洲的一个每年举办一次的活动：包容周（ Inclusion Week），这个活动的时间是 9 月 27 日到 10 月 3 日，旨在庆祝生活中各种各样的「包容」。
这个意外的发现让我思考：包容对我（设计师）而言意味着什么？或者说，包容性设计意味着什么？
什么是包容性设计？
作为设计师我们要清楚，我们做出的每一个设计决策都不一定会包括我们的最终用户。
包容性设计强调理解用户的多样性，并乐于接纳不同的用户真正参与到你的产品、服务甚至组织当中。包容性设计的理念不仅考虑了「普通」或「典型」用户的文化，社交和需求；还考虑了「不正常」，「非典型」的边缘群体。
根据微软的说法：包容性设计是「一种能够充分利用并实现人类多样性的方法。最重要的是，这意味着包容和学习不同的观念。」
1. 包容性设计和无障碍是一回事吗？
包容性设计不是为所有人只做一件事，正如微软设计主管 Susan Goltsman 所说：

包容性设计并不意味着你为所有人设计一件同样的产品；而是说你设计了可以让不同人以不同的方式参与进来的方式，并确保了每个人都…</span>

中国文艺网特别推出“喜迎第十一次全国文代会”栏目，在“牢记重托 不负期望”系列中邀请知名文艺家讲述当面聆听习近平总书记重要讲话或者收到总书记致信回信的切身感受，表达牢记重托、不负期望，繁荣发展文艺事业、推动文化强国建设的决心与信心。


本期推出中国文联荣誉委员、中国戏剧家协会名誉主席、著名京剧表演艺术家尚长荣专访。

2014年，习近平总书记亲自主持召开文艺工作座谈会并发表重要讲话。尚长荣是现场发言的7位文艺家之一。
2020年，习近平总书记给中国戏曲学院师生回信。尚长荣是中国戏曲学院老中青少四代师生代表之一。
在习近平总书记讲话、回信精神鼓舞下，年逾八旬的尚长荣依然活跃在舞台上，为中华优秀传统文化传承创新不懈奔忙。他说，习近平总书记给广大文艺家、文艺工作者增添了信心、传递了能量、给予了动力。戏曲工作者要更加坚定文化自信，在守正创新的基础上，不断发扬中华优秀戏曲文化。

中国文艺网：2014年，习近平总书记亲自主持召开文艺工作座谈会。您是现场发言的7位文艺家之一。能和我们谈一谈您的发言情况吗？
尚长荣：那次会议我记忆犹新。我是第二个发言的。汇报完毕后，习近平总书记和我进行了交流。他提到了我主演的《贞观盛事》《廉吏于成龙》，认为很有现实针对性，能够起到启迪、警示的作用，支持我们继续搞好这方面的工作。
中国文艺网：习近平总书记在文艺工作座谈会上发表了重要讲话，您个人感觉对我国戏曲事业和戏曲工作者来说具有什么样的意义？

为什么全世界都在关注中国？清华大学国家战略研究院资深研究员谢茂松告诉观察者网，中国现在是世界经济最大的引擎。而中国共产党是引领中国经济的重要因素，国际社会当然会对中国崛起和中国共产党未来的路线进行「特别关照」。另外，「中国又不同于美国的「功利主义」，中国打造的是共同体，带动比如发展中国家共同发展。所以全世界都在关注中国」。

这场比赛的焦点，在于浓眉对字母在攻防两端的表现。相比起字母哥的在球场两端的发挥，浓眉看上去似乎落了下风。“美国杨毅”史密斯怒斥了浓眉的“回击乏力”，虎扑湖人区更是以“浓眉夺冠赛季后的堕落不自律”为主题，进行了心理与身体状态上的大讨论。然而，如果细究比赛进程，从全局出发，浓眉在进攻端还是发挥出了重要的作用，而在防守端对字母的防守丢分，也更多来自于一种体系中定位的无奈。相应地，威少的进攻端表现则受到了沃格尔的表扬，“打出了湖人生涯最好的一场比赛”。
那么，浓眉的作用是如何发挥的？威少的表现上升，与浓眉有无关联？本场比赛的湖人，是否有一些让人看到一些希望——他们最需要这个，最起码得有“盼头”——的比赛内容呢？

在这支湖人队中，浓眉的防守任务是非常沉重的。在近期的比赛中，湖人常规性地使用了三后卫的阵容。这一排法，当然是为了在现有资源的现实前提下、尽量为威少缓解防守压力。本赛季，威少在防守挡拆持球人时，平均每回合让对手得到0.83分，每场需要完成3.6个回合，占他总防守比例的35.1%.而同队的布拉德利与里弗斯，防守挡拆的回合数比威少还略多0.1和0.2，每回合对手得分只有0.79和0.57分。
而在防守轮转后的弱侧盯人中，威少也往往难以做出正确的判断----他已经在执行湖人防守体系的换防要求，大量增加了防守中的移动，每个防守回合中的移动距离排名队内第一，并非在每个回合中都是蹲篮下等待篮板的懒散存在，但却由于对进攻阅读的不准、防守沟通的不力，他在移动上往往显得犹犹豫豫、去而复返，无效跑动很多，加上运动能力的消耗，便很难执行出坚决、效率的到位换防，防守端的平均移动速度排名队内倒数第三。这就导致了威少在防守端制造的“窟窿”效果：上场时，对手每百回合可以得到109.9分，而下场后湖人反而压到了103.8分。

威少在场上的正向作用主要是进攻端的球权消化，在防…</span>

                    <span>Your CTO handed you a project to revamp or build your product’s notification system recently. You realized the complexity of this project around the same time as you discovered that there’s not a lot of information online on how to do it. Companies like LinkedIn, Uber, and Slack have large teams of over 25 employees working just on notifications, but smaller companies like yours don’t have that luxury. So how can you meet the same level of quality with a team of one? This is the third post in our series on how you, a developer, can build or improve the best notification system for your company. It follows the first post about identifying user requirements and designing with scalability and reliability in mind. In this piece, we will learn about setting up routing and preferences.

                    <span>For release 0.3, I worked on IPC144 as my internal project contribution. The issue is Add Progressive Web App (PWA) support.  
I started to install PWA plugin, but Docusaurus, I had some version not matching issue. It turns out that the current project is using an older version of Docusaurus (2.0.0-beta.2). The PWA plugin version has to match the version of Docusaurus to work.
I created another pull request for upgrading Docusaurus to version (2.0.0-beta.8). After the pull request got merged, I can start working on the PWA feature.
To implement PWA, we first need an icon for 192x192  and 512x512. After that, we need to create a manifest.json to add all the settings for PWA.

                    <span>Introduction


While waiting for reviews in my recent pull request, I decided to find a different project. After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.
A quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties&#x27; blogs about anything open-source. 
For my task, I had to customize Telescope&#x27;s build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:
Add header and side navigation bar
Change side navigation default logo into Telescope logo
Update link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./




  
  
  Working on the issue


After setting up the development environment using Telescope&#x27;s documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.
I began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn&#x27;t break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. 
Since I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn&#x27;t break or miss anything.
Similar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.
Cheers! 🍻</span>

Wondering, what&#x27;s up with this weird ancient art? Well, they help portray how civilization evolved much like how we learned to evolve our ways to talk to machines. Like us humans divided our society to do specific tasks say carpenters to work with wood, barbers to trim our hairs, similarly, we can ask machines to work specifically on something or take a specific action when some work is given. As an example imagine, when we wake up, we follow the below step -
Get your bed done &gt; Brush your teeth &gt; Wash your face &gt; Dry your face
For machines, these are described as functions. To understand what a function is imagine a set of instructions that needs to be done when something happens.
Now you might think why do we need to have functions? It&#x27;s simple, however much we l…</span>

                    <span>For release 0.3, I started to contribute on Heptagram repo. The notice that they migrated their website into React. I found out that they do not have prettier set up for the new React project. So I created an issue and asked to be assigned to work on that issue ✨❓ Feature Request: Add Prettier config. 
I first started to install prettier, and add a script for it, one for checking and the other one for writing.
 &quot;prettier&quot;: &quot;prettier --write \&quot;./**/*.{md,jsx,json,html,css,js,yml}\&quot;&quot;,
 &quot;prettier-check&quot;: &quot;prettier --check \&quot;./**/*.{md,jsx,json,html,css,js,yml}\&quot;&quot;

After that, I made .prettierrc.json and add some rules.
{
    &quot;arrowParens&quot;: &quot;always&quot;,
    &quot;bracketSpacing&quot;: true,
    &quot;embeddedLanguageFormatting&quot;: &quot;auto&quot;,
    &quot;endOfLine&quot;: &quot;lf&quot;,
    &quot;htmlWhitespaceSensitivity&quot;: &quot;css&quot;,
    &quot;insertPragma&quot;: false,
    &quot;jsxSingleQuote&quot;: false,
    &quot;proseWrap&quot;: &quot;preserve&quot;,
    &quot;quoteProps&quot;: &quot;as-needed&quot;,
    &quot;requirePragma&quot;: false,
    &quot;singleQuote&quot;: true,
    &quot;tabWidth&quot;: 4,
    &quot;trailingComma&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,
    &quot;useTabs&quot;: false,
    &quot;vueIndentScriptAndStyle&quot;: false,
    &quot;printWidth&quot;: 100
}

I committed and pushed my change to remote, then I created a PR for asking if the prettier format is ok before I run a prettier on all files which change the whole project file format. 
After receiving confirmation that everything is okay. I run npm run prettier to change all the files and commit my change then after a few hours my PR got merged.</span>

As the frontend becomes larger, while holding multiple domains of responsibilities (for example — navigation, user, authorization, e. g. ), the frontend application is developed, deployed and hosted as a single application. 
Micro-frontends allows us to use those different applications not just on the code base, but also in development, deployment and serve, in order to provide:
Loosely coupled applications
Faster development, debugging, and testing flows
Performance — smaller chunks
Full Isolation while testing, developing, and deploying

During this article we will review the frontend application that is built out of the shell and 3 applications that represent a domain:

                    <span>Changing your company&#x27;s culture can be difficult, especially if you are persuading your boss, company, or leadership team to open source a project. The hard truth is that businesses care about finances, specifically how to acquire and retain money.  Their concerns are valid. Without financial stability and growth, the company is at risk of coming to a halt, which affects its employees and customers. The goal of a business is to stay in business. Perhaps, you understand that, and you see that open sourcing a project will help the company thrive more, but you&#x27;re unsure how to help your employer recognize the value in open sourcing a project.

I was hesitating in going because I&#x27;m sort of an introvert and going into a room full of strangers is not what I imagine when I think about doing something fun. Fortunately, I pushed myself to go, thinking that, at least, I would listen to what the speakers had to say.
To my surprise, I enjoyed the experience quite much. I didn&#x27;t do much networking, but I could see and hear about people from different backgrounds trying to start (and continue) their careers in software development. The Meetup was focused on junior developers, so the discussion was focused on how to get jobs and the first steps after getting a job.

                    <span>Django is a top Python web-framework known for its features, scalability, and flexibility.
In this guide, we&#x27;ll walk through how you can deploy your Django projects with Cleavr.io.
Before proceeding, you&#x27;ll need to have an active Cleavr.io account and have a server provisioned and ready-to-go.
Add a new NodeJS SSR site to your server in Cleavr.
We&#x27;re using NodeJS SSR as the site&#x27;s app type as it will install Node AND PM2 to the server. PM2 manages more than just node applications, so we&#x27;ll take advantage of this to serve our Django app and keep it alive.
In the Django project, locate the settings.py file, or wherever you have ALLOWED_HOSTS defined, and add the domain used in the previous step to the list of allowed hosts.
For example, this is what our example looks like:

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第18天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
前言
在 Dart 编码中，我们会经常遇到需要处理 null 的场合。Dart 2.12版本引入 null safety 以后，对 null 的处理有了新的规范。关于 null safety 特性，可以阅读本人的另一篇文章：升级踩坑，聊聊 Dart 的 null safety，本篇介绍如何正确处理 null。
规范1：不要显式地将变量初始化为 null
如果一个变量声明的时候是 non-null 的话，赋值为 null 时，编译器会报错；而如果一个变量声明为 nullable 的话，会隐式地以 null 初始化，因此如果再赋值 null 那就是多此一举了。在 Dart 中不存在未初始化的内存问题，因此没必要初始化为 null。
// 正确示例
Item? bestDeal(List cart) {
  Item? bestItem;
  // ...
}

// 错误示例
Item? bestDeal(List cart) {
  Item? bestItem &#x3D; null;
  // ...
}

规范2：不要为函数参数设置 null 默认值
如果设置一个函数的参数是 nullable 的话，同样的，也会隐式地复制 null，因此没必要重复设置默认值。
// 正确示例
void error([String? message]) {
  print(message ?? &#x27;未知错误&#x27;);
}

// 错误示例
void error([String? message &#x3D; null]) {
  print(message ?? &#x27;未知错误&#x27;);
}

规范3：使用 ?? 操作符将 null 转换为布尔值

@南鱼祭酒：realme Watch T1 橄榄绿 

购买渠道：realme 京东自营旗舰店
入手价格：橄榄绿、活力黑均为原价 699，首发 599；黑薄荷无首发优惠，且仅限 OPPO 商城购买
下单及签收日期：10 月 26 日下定金，31 日付尾款，11 月 1 日发货，2 日签收

今年双十一到手的第一个大货，就是 realme 新发布的第一款智能穿戴产品 T1 手表。T1 共有三种配色，传统的橄榄绿和活力黑，以及颇有 realme 特色的黑薄荷（OPPO 商城独占）。我买到的是橄榄绿配色。

我之前用过的智能手环 / 手表只有三只：索尼 SWR30 手环、跃我（Amazfit）GTR 手表和 OPPO 手环（时尚版），所以我这里比较的对象主要就是它们仨，其它产品我了解得不够全面，如有说错，欢迎大家和气指出。

买这只 T1，对于我个人来说主要原因有这么几个方面：

我的主力手机是 realme X50 Pro，自家的东西理应配合得天衣无缝对吧；
可以离线听歌。据我所知，目前市面上可以离线听歌的安卓手表，价格都要一千起步，T1 标准价 699 首发 599，这个价格太有竞争力了；
可以接听手机。这个功能其实我不太需要（把手腕抬到嘴边说话还有点特工的意思，举到耳边则看起来有点尴尬）；
支持 110 种运动方式（有必要吗？），该有动力运动起来了吧；
最重要的，好看。Realme 的设计风格是冲着年轻人去的，设计师水平也不低，比荣耀、跃我之类的中老年手表好看太多了。

拿到手之后，设置一…</span>

                    <span>这是个信息轰炸的时代，除了必要的信息过滤手段外，每个人都应该构建属于自己的个人知识库。
一、个人数据库避坑指南
前两天有个用户给我邮件问了一些问题，我觉得非常有意思，也很有代表性，所以聊聊这个事情。
为免隐私问题，我把一些内容打码了，请勿对号入座。
使用过笔记类软件的朋友都知道，这位朋友遇到的可能是一个共性问题，也就是：我们自己的笔记究竟该如何处理才最方便、最有助于个人成长？不同的软件有不同的理念，有的服务注重开放性，能够与市面上的其他服务共通，便于定制自己的知识空间；有的软件则认为自己的知识整理理念独一无二且非常优秀，因此相对封闭，便于吸引用户且留住用户。在这篇文章中，针对笔记和知识整理领域，我们来共同探讨关于个人数据整理的问题：

究竟什么样的个人数据存储方案才是好的？
如何构建适合自己的数据存储空间？
构建自己的个性化服务应该注意哪些内容？

1. All-in-one VS All-in-all

先来看第一个问题：什么样的存储方式才是「好」的？
现在是 21 世纪，因为疫情，云服务在这两年大热。在这两年，不少云存储服务也百花齐放。但说到存储，首先要搞清楚我们要存储些什么东西？既然是要存，我们希望的自然是能够「在我想要的时候找到它」，减少损坏、降低遗失的几率。各家云服务为我们提供了随时获取自己数据的权利，但也带来一个问题，那就是：我们存到云端的数据，还是我们的吗？随着不少云服务供应商的政策变化，我们越来越注意到，放在云端，虽然方便获取，但也方便丢失了。靠谱的供应商还给你数据导出和备份的机会，不靠谱的，直接关掉你的账户，你的数据、记忆、情感、心血，可能一瞬间就灰飞烟灭。所以，这两年回归本地仓储的声音也越来越高。因为，放到云里，实在太不稳定了。
那么，多备份几份数据不就好了？
是这样，一个服务商丢了，我们可以从另一家获取。我的还是我的。这就是 All-in-all 的存…</span>

                    <span>浏览器是我们网上冲浪必不可少的工具之一，不管你在用的是哪一款，新标签页往往都是我们进入网络世界的重要入口。因此市面上已经有了不少对新标签页进行美化或增强的第三方扩展程序，比如少数派介绍过的 Momentum、Infinity 等。这些新标签页扩展很多又会以「个性化定制」为卖点，我们在点开浏览器图标的同时，只属于自己的网络浏览体验就已经准备好了。

也正是因为类似的原因，Google 近日推出的 Tab Maker 才如此具有吸引力——作为 Chrome 背后的缔造者，Google 推出的这款小工具将选择权完全交给用户，让我们即便没有任何代码基础也能制作一款只属于自己的新标签页扩展。

和大多数「零代码」工具一样，Tab Maker 为我们提供了非常直观的分步引导和图形化定制界面。在 Tab Maker 官网选择 Make your own 进入在线编辑器页面后，我们首先需要从 11 种预置模板中选择一种进行编辑（也可以导入其它人分享过来的 .zip 文件）。

随后 Tab Maker 会引导我们创建一个用于页面内容搭建的 Google Sheet 表格模板。我们此刻需要做的是生成一份这份表格的副本，并将其保存到自己的 Google Drive 存储中。

然后就是在 Google Sheet 中自由发挥的时候了：

表格中每一行都代表着一个标签页，我们可以为其添加上页面的背景图片、在每个区块中添加上我们想添加的文字或图片（图片需为链接的形式）
也可以为每个区块附加上超链接，这样区块就具备了点击跳转至目标链接的能力

为了避免大家在 Google Sheet 和 Tab Maker 中来回跳转，表格的左上角还贴心地加上了我们选择的模板样式缩略图。
编辑完表格内容后，接下来我们需要将表格转为公开形式：依次点击左上角菜单 File &gt; Share &gt; Publish to we…</span>

                    <span>很多人都会在浏览器收藏夹里常备一个网速测试工具。每当连上一个新网络需要测试效果，或是感觉网络卡顿需要排查故障，这类工具就能派上用场。
但是，这个「裁判员」的选择并不应该是随意的。如果用运营商提供的测速页面，则只能反应到城域网关这一小段的连通性，以此代表实际网速无异于自欺欺人；另一方面，如果测速平台的规模太小，经常匹配到一个远在天边的节点，也会出现「误诊」的问题。
目前，比较常见的选择是 Ookla 旗下的 Speedtest.net；Netflix 开设的 fast.com 也被广泛使用。但是，就国内使用而言，前者并非在所有城市都能找到合适的测速节点，而后者的可访问性则较差。
好消息是，从今年的 macOS Monterey 开始， macOS 已经内置了一个网络情况测试工具 networkQuality。这个工具利用 Apple 遍布全球的 CDN（内容分发网络）服务器来测速，比较客观准确，在很多场景下可以免去寻找第三方工具的麻烦。同时，它还会对当前网络的拥堵情况作出直观的高低评价，帮你快速估测此地是否适合打电话、玩游戏。
基本使用
networkQuality 是一个命令行工具，需要使用「终端」App（或者你首选的其他终端模拟器）运行。方法是：
首先，点按「程序坞」（Dock）中的「启动台」（LaunchPad）图标，在搜索栏中键入「终端」，然后点按「终端」图标。
（或者，在「访达」中，打开 /应用程序/实用工具 文件夹，然后双击「终端」。）
在打开的终端窗口中，输入 networkQuality（注意大小写），然后回车。

此时，系统会开始同时测试下载和上传速度，并将当前速率实时显示在终端窗口中，形如：
current download capacity: 247.850 Mbps - current upload capacity: 9.545 Mbps

                    <span>平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。
首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。
《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。
其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。
然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）
1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。

游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。
2. 关于形状的错觉。

一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。
3. 颜色的错觉。


这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）
4. 负空间。

在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。
5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）

虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。
6. 倒影或平面变成实体

挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。
7. 透过遮罩的场景

我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？
8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方

这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。
游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。
第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。

                    <span>《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。
番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。
当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。
至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。
第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。
第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。
最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。
以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。

                    <span>这是透视相机。 




 
这是笼中窥梦。 




 
这是正交相机。 




 
这是纪念碑谷。 




 
这是平面素材。 




 
这是画中世界。（其实是固定位置的透视相机！不是平面素材那么简单的！） 




 
你发现了吗？透视相机是近大远小的，离镜头比较近的地块要明显大一些。它和人眼在现实中的观察是一致的，所以在绝大多数3D游戏中，你都是用《笼中窥梦》的这种视角去观察周围的世界。 





对于《笼中窥梦》这种解谜游戏来说，选择透视相机和自由视角其实会让设计难度暴增。因为视角稍稍变动，物体的大小就会发生改变。想要找到一个适合做谜题的角度，需要精挑细选，反复琢磨。当然，这也给了谜题设计极大的自由度，能够容纳更有趣的点子。 



而正交相机就比较有意思了：无论物体距离距离有多远，在场景中的大小都能够保持一致。 
所以这种投影模式经常被用来做2.5D游戏，也会用来渲染一些2D场景，使其更有立体感。 



《纪念碑谷》也正是凭借着正交相机的这个特点，将原本分离的两个结构在视错觉下巧妙地组合到一起，进而构建出优秀的谜题： 





平面绘图的画中世界则更加直观。横版游戏都会这样把视角固定在水平面上，优秀的代表作品同样百花齐放： 




 
也同样复杂。 
即使视角固定，《画中世界》也充分利用了透视相机镜头拉远/推近带来的纵深感，设计出高难的谜题。不要真的以为是简单的平面素材啦！《笼中窥梦》的谜题设计思路和它是一脉相承的，也难怪《笼中窥梦》的设计师曾经向《画中世界》的设计师Jason Roberts请教谜题设计的方法。 
《画中世界》镜头推进

所以你会发现，《笼中窥梦》、《纪念碑谷》、《画中世界》虽然分别利用了不同的操纵视角与投影技术，却同样完成了“视觉欺骗”这一艺术效果，各自形成了各自的特色。 
《画中世界》有独特的视觉风格，有将两幅画叠加到一块来推进解谜这种平面艺术独有的思路；《纪念碑谷》依托正交相机，可以肆意改变场景的结构而不变形，为艾达公主用想象不到的方式开山搭桥；《笼中窥梦》解放了视角和操纵的限制，可以在游戏内容中塞入固定视角游戏难以承载的细节，在为谜题设计提供更多可能的同时，支撑起了一个元素众多，情节曲折的明暗线叙事。 




 
视错觉解密游戏为何如此令人着迷？我想，因为绝大部分的游戏也许都是对现实的模仿，但视错觉是对现实的超越。它创新，因为它挑战人的思维边界，因为它是属于电子游戏才能创造出来的独特乐趣。实话说，我很高兴能够看到，我们也能出现一个做出《笼中窥梦》的Optillusion工作室，能在Optical illusion（视觉欺骗）这个领域贡献一些独到精美的东西，和优秀的前辈作品们站在一起也不逊色。

                    <span>Between meetings today, I learned about Django and continued my journey to a Javascript certificate from FreeCodeCamp.
I started today with working on FreeCodeCamp tutorials for about an hour. I then had to prepare for a couple meetings I had today. Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.
At the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.
I will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.
I also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week&#x27;s worth of changes. 
A little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I&#x27;m not too upset about it. 
A clean slate, a new approach!
I am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it&#x27;s really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. 
Complicated state management between components. I still haven&#x27;t quite nailed it down.

  ⚙️ Entendendo um pouco do contexto Geral.


Na computação temos um Tipo chamado: &quot;Booleano&quot;. O que é: Booleano? 
Aqui estamos falando tipo primitivo do TypeScript: &quot;Boolean&quot;. (⊙.☉)7
Ser do tipo (Booleano) significa que algum valor, isto é, alguma variável, constante ou qualquer coisa que possuí em si um valor desse tipo pode ser: 
Verdadeiro (Isto é, true) 👍
Falso (Isto é, false) 👎
O nome &quot;Booleano&quot; (Boolean em TypeScript) faz uma homenagem ao Matemático &amp; Filósofo George Boole, ele &quot;construiu&quot; a base algébrica necessária para a criação Lógica Algébrica que podemos usar para: Operações lógicas (em booleanos) como conjunção (||), disjunção (&amp;&amp;), disjunção exclusiva ((p &amp;&amp; !q) || (!p &amp;&amp; q)), equivalência lógica (&#x3D;&#x3D;) e negação (!), que corres…</span>

                    <span>Problem: Conditional Ellipsis without CSS


I want to add an ellipsis to data that&#x27;s brought in from a service without having to use CSS&#x27; text-overflow: ellipsis feature, since it&#x27;s unreliable and could break overtime if not monitored during refactoring.
Slice Pipe



  
  
  Determine character max overflow limit



Determine max overflow by number of characters (instead of max-width)
Example: max overflow characters 20 (inclusive, aka 20 or more)
I use slice pipe where you add the start and end of the slice to the interpolated string






  {{ item.name | slice: 0 : 20 }}


span



Conditional span is based on data&#x27;s length






  {{ item.name | slice:0:20 }}&#x3D; 20…</span>

But I haven&#x27;t called the function yet. So how in the world does VS Code know which lines of code won&#x27;t be used in the future, when the code finally does run?

If we have a conditional statement, VS Code accurately evaluates the potential for us to hit the code outside of it:

bool could turn out to be false after all. But if we change the condition to true VS Code knows we will always run that block and (if there is an inevitable return inside) never reach the final line:

It&#x27;s almost as if VS Code has the ability to understand the semantics of code. But under the hood VS Code uses code to do this! How?

  Audience


This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I&#x27;ve tried to make it approachable for beginners but it&#x27;s really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.
In this series we&#x27;re going to start with no authentication and then you&#x27;ll add a very basic authentication system. Then you&#x27;ll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…</span>

                    <span>日常生活中我们几乎每个人都会拥有大量网站帐号，时间久远了密码很容易忘记。因此，像 1Password 等密码管理 + 同步 + 一键登录的工具成为了很多人的首选。
然而 1Password 毕竟要付费，也有人会担心这类工具有隐私泄露的风险。其实，如果你有一台自己的 VPS 服务器，那么就能用开源的 Bitwarden 部署搭建一个私人专属的密码管理服务来代替 1Password！这样不仅免费，重要的是，所有的数据均保存在自己服务器上，更加放心……

                    <span>大力智能技术团队-客户端 都梁人
前言
本文旨在通过实际业务场景阐述如何使用Kotlin Flow解决Android开发中的痛点问题，进而研究如何优雅地使用Flow以及纠正部分典型的使用误区。有关Flow的介绍及其操作符用法可以参考：异步流 - Kotlin 语言中文站，本文不做赘述。基于LiveData+ViewModel的MVVM架构在某些场景下（以横竖屏为典型）存在局限性，本文会顺势介绍适合Android开发的基于Flow/Channel的MVI架构。
背景
大力智能客户端团队在平板端大力一起学App上深度适配了横竖屏场景，将原先基于Rxjava的MVP架构重构成基于LiveData+ViewModel+Kotlin协程的MVVM架构。随着业务场景的复杂度提升，LiveData作为数据的唯一载体似乎渐渐无法担此重任，其中一个痛点就是由于模糊了“状态”和“事件”的界限。LiveData的粘性机制会带来副作用，但这本身并不是LiveData的设计缺陷，而是对它的过度使用。
Kotlin Flow是基于kotlin协程的一套异步数据流框架，可以用于异步返回多个值。kotlin 1.4.0正式版发布时推出了StateFlow和SharedFlow，两者拥有Channel的很多特性，可以看作是将Flow推向台前，将Channel雪藏幕后的一手重要操作。对于新技术新框架，我们不会盲目接入，在经过调研试用一阶段后，发现Flow确实可以为业务开发止痛提效，下文分享这个探索的过程。
痛点一：蹩脚地处理ViewModel和View层通信
发现问题
当屏幕可旋转后，LiveData不好用了？
项目由MVP过渡到MVVM时，其中一个典型的重构手段就是将Presenter中的回调写法改写成在ViewModel中持有LiveData由View层订阅，比如以下场景：

OCR pro 对标点符号的识别真的是差强人意，这其实恰恰是很多人标点符号使用上会出现的问题，所以才会有 pangu.js 的出现，pangu.js 的作用就是优化中英文排版问题，具体规范可见 中文文案排版指北，其中自然包括了中英文之间的空格问题和半角全角标点符号使用。
通过 pangu.js，我们很容易实现对摘录文本和标题的排版优化，我只做了很小的工作，相当于把 pangu.js 引入 Marginnote 中，基础代码修改自 Autotitile，感谢。
使用
本插件默认开启摘录优化，不支持关闭，我认为这是必不可少的过程。
提供按键开启点击卡片优化标题和摘录。但很遗憾，目前提供的 API 点击卡片后只能获取到卡片内第一个笔记以及标题，所以无法优化卡片内所有的摘录和评论，不过你可以点击文章中的摘录来触发。当然，从现在开始，你摘录的所有文字都将得到排版优化。

最后，提供一个批量制作选题题到anki的思路，就是在Mac上对选题的Word文档进行格式调整，在修改上快捷指令的基础上（比如删除开头有关Python脚本的引用，从获得粘贴板开始），就能实现Mac端复制，iPad端粘贴制卡，5秒就能搞定。
以上代码适合大多数题目的制作，总得门槛不算很高，对于快捷指令的修改，我在指令里有说明，我也是代码小白一名，希望能和大家一块交流学习，有兴趣的朋友可以尝试一下。</span>

                    <span>如果一件事物真的流行了起来，就不需要人为地制造「XX 元年」的概念，正如视频自媒体的兴起，以绝对的掌握力，统治了各类内容领域。我们买东西之前要看评测；买完要分享体验视频；旅游要发游记；生活内容要做成 Vlog。
世界被切割成几分钟到十几分钟的片段，代替了它本来的样子。
而从商业的角度来看，如果你错过了博客、微博、微信公众号的黄金时代，你绝对不想再错过短视频所带来的致富机会。即使「元宇宙」的概念已经出现，但它甚至还没到自己的「元年」呢。在肉眼可预见的几年内，视频依旧会是最主流的内容形式。
所以问题来了：

2021 年，该如何成为一名视频创作者？
在创作的过程中，有什么样的前人经验可以借鉴，又有什么样的难处需要面对呢？
在视频创作领域已经高度发展的 2021 年，你还应该成为一名全职视频创作者吗？

如果你对这些话题感兴趣，欢迎参加 11 月 19 日（本周五）20 点举办的「一派·在线沙龙」活动。

                    <span>我玩动森已经一年多了，非常肝，目前进度是岛上环境已经达到了五星，博物馆的生物以及艺术品全部收集齐，更新前的大部分 DIY 手册和家具我都拥有了，目前游戏基本上处于一个磨磨蹭蹭岛建的阶段，每天上线 10 分钟左右做完日常任务就下线。虽然还在玩，但是总感觉缺少了最初玩的时候那种激动和新鲜，也缺少了动力。
很多次我都觉得这个游戏就是目前这样了，单机游戏能玩一年多，我已经很满足了。
所以当我看到动森更新的消息之后真的非常非常激动，甚至可以没有看 2.0 版本的更新日志，就直接上手玩了，又非常肝地玩了几天。我想，哪怕我不买 DLC，这个游戏我还能再玩个一年多。
更个性化的岛民服务
一开始就看到西施惠亲切地播报，说我的小岛可以由岛民代表（也就是我）去改变生活条例，这是一项影响岛的重大决策。改变生活条例属于和西施惠的谈话中「关于岛的方针」的内容，办理条例需要花费 20000 铃钱的协助金，一共包括四种条例，分别是优美岛条例、早鸟条例、夜猫条例、经济复苏条例。
西施惠介绍说夜猫条例是一项推迟商店结束营业的时间，熬夜并繁荣岛上夜生活的条例，我毫不犹豫就选了这条。因为我确实喜欢熬夜，而且我忙完可以玩动森的时间大多都超过了岛上商店和服装店的营业时间，无法买买卖商品和衣服。我的一位朋友逐渐淡坑的一个很重要的原因就是，等可以玩动森的时候都是深夜，商店也关门了，小动物也睡觉了，一个人孤零零的很无聊。夜猫条例就很便于我这种睡觉时间偏晚的人，也方便白天没有太多时间玩的社畜。
当然，如果你喜欢早起，可以选择早鸟条例。看到这一点的更新，我真的非常开心，也觉得非常温暖和治愈。这种更新考虑到了不同人的作息时间，可以让大家更自如地选择玩游戏的时间。
另外优美岛条例与岛的景观有关，经济复苏条例与交易有关。处于游戏其他阶段的朋友可以考虑。

除了西施惠那边的更新，我也和狸克聊了聊。狸克告诉我说房间收纳空间又可以扩容啦，…</span>

                    <span>随着可能是今年最后一场线上发布会的落幕，堪称 Apple 年度最重要的新品之一，传闻已久的 14 英寸和 16 英寸 MacBook Pro 终于在上个月与大家正式见面。
新款 MacBook Pro 是 5 年多来变化最大的一代：不仅有着全新的外观设计，M1 Pro / Max 芯片的加入也让预计为期 2 年的 Apple 芯片转移计划，在经过一半的这个时间点，实现了一大步跨越。里里外外全面焕新，也标志着 MacBook Pro 这款产品，开启了「下一个五年」的新世代。
虽然新款 MacBook Pro 的方方面面都带给了我们不少惊喜，比如更强得多的全新 M1 架构芯片、支持 ProMotion 自适应刷新率的 mini-LED 显示屏，以及终于拿掉了 Touch Bar、键程更长的内置妙控键盘等等。但我们也能看到许多妥协与遗憾，比如个人认为实在难以称得上好看、也不支持 Face ID 的「刘海屏」；当然还有无法让人忽视的尺寸与重量。
复古的外观设计，在「妥协」中找到「平衡」
在聊新款 MacBook Pro 全新外观设计之前，不妨先简单回顾一下这款产品的历史。
事实上，MacBook Pro 是一款 2006 年才首次推出的笔记本电脑产品，它的历史在 Mac 系列电脑中实际上相当短暂；在此之前，Apple 推出过 iBook、PowerBook、PowerBook G3 / G4 等多个系列的笔记本电脑产品，而第一台 Mac 电脑，则是 Apple 在 1984 年推出的台式电脑 Macintosh 128K。
第一台 Mac 电脑 Macintosh 128K。1997 年推出的 Macintosh PowerBook 2400c。2005 年推出的最后一款 PowerBook G4。

                    <span>做菜要用到的高温功能家电中，除了灶台、电磁炉等，烤箱现在也成了我家必不可少、几乎天天在使用的电器了，温度时间可调控、无油烟、是做烘焙的必需品，同时用烤箱来做菜的话，也兼有少油、省心、不易焦糊、不用频繁翻面的优势。不过和明火相比起来，烤箱菜的做法还是有些不同，也可以玩出更多花样，本篇文章列出了多道烤箱入门菜谱，蔬菜肉类甜品皆有涵盖，大概按照从易到难的顺序，不过总体来看都是比较简单的，希望对刚刚入手烤箱或是烤箱在家里搁置了很久也不知道怎么用的朋友们有所帮助。
在菜谱内容正式展开之前，先列出烤箱制作中需要常备的物件们：

一台烤箱；适配烤箱尺寸的烤盘、烤网；
可直接放置食物的耐高温烤碗（烤碗不可以直接放在发热管上！一定要垫在烤盘烤网上）；油刷；
烤纸（烤纸的作用是隔离开食物和碗盘起到不粘作用，否则像饼皮一类的在加热过程中会直接和碗底黏在一起，一抓就漏料。烤纸还能防脏，比如漏下去的蛋液在烤制时会在底部成焦疤状，有垫纸的话烤完直接把纸扔掉就行，否则刷渣子要刷好久）；
食品夹；
防烫手套。

另外一些关于烤箱的重点 tips：

每台烤箱的脾气都不太一样，有的温度会偏高或偏低，有的内壁炉温会高于靠近箱门的炉温所以可能会出现摆在里面的食物有点焦了摆靠外面的食物还没熟的情况，这些都需要大家在使用自家烤箱的过程中去熟悉，也建议大家把网上看到的菜谱中标示的温度和时间仅作为参考，根据实际情况进行调整。若还不清楚自家烤箱的温度情况，刚开始可以先在烤制中途蹲在旁边多盯盯，如果发现熟了甚至是有点焦了就提前取出，如果预设时间到了还没熟就再增加时长，或是备一根烤箱温度计。
烤箱使用前都需要预热，建议提前 5–10 分钟先将烤箱调至需要的温度打开进行加热，下文中提到的烤箱使用时长都是预热后、菜品需要在烤箱里呆的时间，不再另外做提示啦，预热很重要很重要很重要，尤其是烘焙来说直接决定了成败，新手们一定记得先预热…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

面对一篇微信公众号的文章，大家可能觉得没什么不寻常，但如果你有看到作者创作时使用的排版工具，便知道一篇文章排版工作的「不易」了。
比如说一篇文章的标题、引言、小标题、段落、引导等等，通常需要在浏览器插件、第三方浏览器等方式逐个插入模板来调整实现。虽然看似方便，但是日复一日重复这些操作，是十分枯燥无味的。
近期因为工作需要我捡起这活，在被「折磨」好一段时间后，发现真的做不来这种重复的工作，于是决定花时间解决它。当然我也并非标新立异，只是觉得一个内容工作者，应该把更多的时间留在内容上，重复的排版工作交给程序执行不是更香吗？
公众号排版样式的自动化
微信公众号的文章并非长篇大论，绝大多数也不是专业文献，所以它最常见的排版样式一般是一级标题、二级标题、正文、引用、图片、加粗等等。
这么一看，很容易联想到专门给写作者用排版语言：Markdown。它的好处是能让你通过键盘就能完成特定的格式排版工作，十分快捷高效。当然了，它也并非复杂的编程语言，可能你只需花 10 分钟就能轻松掌握。
比如说：写一级标题只需在文字前面加一个 # 号，引用段落样式只需在文字前加 &gt; 号，文字加粗则在文字两边分别加两个 * 号：
Markdown演示（少数派的读者都很熟悉了～）
如上图所示，通过 Markdown 写作，我们解决了内容排版样式自动化。但最重要的问题是：微信公众号编辑器不支持 Markdown，我们该如何同步自动化排版好的内容呢？

这把琴的介绍词是这样的：“在炮火纷飞的战场上，志愿军战士充分发扬革命乐观主义精神，在战斗间隙开展各种娱乐活动。激烈的战斗过后，志愿军战士利用缴获的美军罐头盒、朝鲜的木材和中国的马尾制作成这把胡琴。战士们给它起名叫‘两洲三国’胡琴。‘两洲’是亚洲和美洲，‘三国’是中国、朝鲜和美国。”
我难以想象，这是怎样一种精神，使得这把琴在炮火连天的战场上、在昏暗狭窄的坑道中发出悠扬的琴声。我不禁为志愿军战士革命乐观主义和革命浪漫主义精神所震撼。
而这，仅仅是中国人民志愿军宣传文化工作的一个剪影。
其实，残酷的战争与灿烂的文化并非“水火不容”。恰恰相反，越是激烈艰苦的战争环境，越需要丰富的文化生活鼓舞斗志。

入朝作战初期，由于志愿军防空力量较为薄弱，白天战士们只能躲在工事里，等待黑夜再进行战斗。在漫长的备战时间里，战士们充分发挥想象力和创造力，自娱自乐地开展了各具特色的文艺活动。如看到东北籍的战士唱起“二人转”，其他地方入伍的战士也争相哼起了自己家乡的小调。有的战士在行军中即兴作诗：“十一号汽车有力气，要带很多好东西，能爬山，能过河，一天要开几十里。”另外，前线的志愿军指战员们在战斗的间隙，以自己的亲身体验为基础创造了许多优秀的战地文艺作品，如歌曲《志愿军战歌》《来一个歼敌大竞赛》，说唱《侦察英雄韩启发》《阵地之家》，小说《突破临津江》等都是其中的代表。
这些志愿军战士自主创作的文艺作品，不仅形象地反映了运动战的特点，同时也洋溢着积极向上的革命乐观主义精神。
除了战士们的自娱自乐，志愿军还组织了专业的文艺演出队伍，爬山岭、进坑道，与志愿军基层指战员一起开展丰富多彩的文化活动

                    <span>Hello all, it&#x27;s been too long but this is the time to tell you about GreyOS!
GreyOS is an open source Meta-OS (nothing related to metaverse, facebook, etc.). I have been developing this since 2013.
GreyOS introduces the new computing era with the Cloud Computer (CC), which is always on, available, fast and secure.
Please check the details at https://github.com/g0d/GreyOS
I am looking for contributors, developers and testers to do so much more, create new integrated apps and reshape the computing landscape into something fresh!</span>

                    <span>Occasionally you might want to rename an AWS S3 bucket you are managing with Terraform. However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.
To avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.
In this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:
resource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {
    bucket &#x3D; “old-name”
}

and you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.
Firstly, we’ll need to create a new bucket. You can do this us…</span>

                    <span>Tailwind CSS comes with &quot;an opinionated set of base styles&quot; called Preflight. A helpful CSS reset built on top of modern-normalize.
Margins, headings, lists, and many others get stripped from their defaults. Thus, achieving cross-browser consistency and an easier adaptation of your design system.
It all sounds helpful, until you need those defaults to style a markdown post.
In comes @tailwindcss/typography, a plugin with sensible typographic styles. It adds a set of prose classes to style content blocks like the one you are reading.
You can install it via npm or yarn:
# Using npm
npm install @tailwindcss/typography

# Using Yarn
yarn add @tailwindcss/typography

Then add the plugin to your tailwind.config.js file:
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports &#x3D; {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require(&#x27;@tailwindcss/typography&#x27;),
    // ...
  ],
}

Finally, you can use the prose class to apply the markdown styling:

  
Welcome to Mars!
  
    Although life on Mars is perfect in every single way, you might have some questions.
  
  
    Of course there’s air! Just don’t breathe it. And, with the crazy gravity situation, everyone can dunk!
  
  


More information about the prose class and its modifiers can be found at the repository.</span>

                    <span>As Docker usage has grown, Docker Compose has become the leader in running multi-service applications locally. Unfortunately, as your application expands and more services must communicate, we’ve found authoring these Compose files can become arduous, time consuming, and mistake prone. We want to make writing Compose files with volumes, ports, and multiple services much easier. 
Today, we’d like to announce the Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code. That’s right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense, Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: 
IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image)

Right-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) 
YAML Syntax Validation 
Hyperlinks for Docker Images 
In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
There are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:
More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation 
… and much more! 
We love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.</span>

This article is based on that presentation. So, let&#x27;s talk about cloud native development and its impact on organisations. Most of my clients are large insurance or financial companies. And the are considering a migration to the cloud. And they are asking for help. The discussions are either based on FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) or snake-oil.

It is not surprising that the truth lies in between.
This is the first of a two part series. Each introduces things we learnt while moving companies into the public cloud.  I focus on culture and organisation. Not because tech is boring. Rather most discussions focus on technology and …</span>

I&#x27;ve used this easy way for a horizontal scroll a lot and I want to share the code with you: ✌️
HTML

  

    

    

  


.horizonal-wrapper {
   height: 100vh;
   width: 100%;
   overflow-y: scroll;
}

.horizonal-content {
   width: max-content;
}

.content-1,
.content-2,
.content-3 {
  width: 50vw;
  height: 100vh;
  float: left;
  border: 1px solid;
}

JS
$(&#x27;.horizonal-wrapper&#x27;).on(&#x27;wheel&#x27;, function(e){

   e.preventDefault();
   $(this).scrollLeft($(this).scrollLeft() + e.originalEvent.deltaY);

});

                    <span>An introduction on how to use useEffect Hook in a React application



  
  
  What is a useEffect Hook?




  
  
  TLDR


React useEffect is an alternative to the &quot;old&quot; class lifecycle methods/hooks.
It can be used to manage side effects, such as network requests, or to run a piece of code when the component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.
Prior to React v16.8, we can only enable a component
lifecycle methods.
useEffect





useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; { //(1) declaration
  // (2)effect
  return () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // (3)cleanup 
  }
}, /* (4)dependency array */)

We can declare an effect by calling either React.useEffect or useEffect


effect is the function that will be called when the component is mounted
OR when the dependency array changes.
cleanup is the function that will be called when the effect…</span>

                    <span>หลังจากลง Docker บน Ubuntu แล้วนั่นเราจะใช้งานมันได้เราต้องใช้สิทธิ์ root ซึ่งต้องสั่ง docker โดยใช้ sudo เช่น sudo docker ps
แต่ถ้าเราอยากสั่งโดยไม่ต้องใช้ sudo ก็สามารถทำได้โดยเพิ่ม user ของเราเข้าไปใช้ usergroup ที่ชื่อว่า docker ด้วยคำสั่งแบบนี้
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

หลังจากนั้น logout แล้ว login อีกที (ถ้าไม่ได้ก็จัดการ restart OS อีกรอบ) เราก็สามารถสั่งคำสั่ง docker ด้วย user เราเองโดยไม่ต้องใช้สิทธิ์ root ผ่าน sudo อีกแล้ว เช่น
docker run hello-world

                    <span>The Beginning


Today I am beginning the 100 Days of Code Challenge. This challenge only asks that you code for one hour a day, every day, for 100 days. I&#x27;ve been mostly sticking to this for a couple months anyway, but I want to officially commit to it as a way to force myself to keep on track and log my progress.
Speaking of logging my progress, I think I&#x27;ll make posts here every 10 days detailing what I&#x27;ve been up to and what I&#x27;ve learned. I&#x27;m in the midst of the Ruby Path at The Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I&#x27;ve been working on building a game of Mastermind, which is easily the most complicated thing I&#x27;ve had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 
Since this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I&#x27;m visiting my family back home. But other than that, I plan to keep on schedule barring some intense illness or emergency. Looking forward to expanding my skills and getting on a new career path 💯</span>

                    <span>How to map a React class life cycle methods/hooks to useEffect



  
  
  Common class lifecycle methods





// happens as soon as your component is mounted
componentDidMount() {}

// happens as soon as the updating begin
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {}

// for certain performance optimizations
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {}

// happens just before the component unmounts
componentWillUnmount() {}
}

Here are basic templates to convert a class lifecycle method to a useEffect hook:
Create an empty dependency array and pass it to the useEffect hook.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  // code to run when the component is mounted 

  // Make sure this is empty to ensure hook will only run once
}, [])

                    <span>Will I have to be on call?
In the last hour of Koan’s on-site interview we turn the tables and invite candidates to interview our hiring team. At face value it’s a chance to answer any open questions we haven’t answered earlier in the process. It’s also a subtle way to introspect on our own hiring process — after three rounds of interviews and side-channel conversations with the hiring manager, what have we missed? What’s on candidates’ minds? Can we address it earlier in the process?
So, you asked, will I have to be on call?
The middle of the night pager rings? The panicked investigations? Remediation, write-ups, post-mortems?
Patrick Collison’s been there, too:
And that&#x27;s how I ruined ducks for myself.

                    <span>TLDR: Closure is the concept of storing a function and its environment together.  When you create a function, it stores the functions local environment and its outer environment together.  If you are ever confused about what value will be present, understand what value existed when the function scope was created!
If you were to look up what a closure is, Wikipedia&#x27;s definition has this to say in the first two lines:
In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. 
That is a bit of a dense definition, but its not a complex as it seems at first glance!  This article aims to …</span>

「这是我参与11月更文挑战的第16天，活动详情查看：2021最后一次更文挑战」
前言
目前移动端跨平台最热的两门技术 Flutter 和 React Native 都非常受欢迎。这两门技术到底该入坑哪一门，我们来根据数据对比及分析来看该如何选择 （只有菜鸟才做选择题，大神会说两个我都要）。
Round 1：谁在背书
两门技术背后都有巨头背书，一个是母公司更过名字的Google，一个是刚刚更名为 Meta 的 Facebook。两个巨头在互联网界是“景行行止，高山仰止”的角色。
作为谷歌的亲儿子，Flutter 诞生于2017年，一开始是提供了移动端的 SDK，通过声明式的组件配置和绝杀技 —— 抹平平台UI差异性渲染引擎 Skia，在跨平台开发界一下子搞得风生水起。 而最近的2.0更是生猛，直接宣布进军 Web、桌面客户端（Windows，Mac OS 和 Linux）和移动端，不得不让人感叹一声“后生可畏”。Flutter使用的 Dart 语言也是编译型的面向对象高级语言，因此执行速度会更快。下面是 Flutter 的一些优点：
免费并且开源，而且社区的开源插件也已经十分丰富。
基于响应式编程的架构设计使得代码更好维护。
基于 Widget 的渲染框架设计，使得 Flutter 应用能够开发出非常漂亮的 UI 界面和提供优秀的用户体验。
React Native 也是一个跨平台的App 开发平台，在2015年的时候被 Facebook 引入。React Native 主要使用 JavaScript 语言进行开发，同样是一套代码可以编译成不同平台的应用。下面是 React Native 的一些特性：
支持热重载，可以加速开发调试过程。
使用当前非常流行的 JavaScript 语言开发，使用 J…</span>

                    <span>MarginNote的功能无疑是强大的，在新推出的 子脑图 功能和 标题链接 等功能的加持下，脑图可以无限层级的延伸、串联，打造个人知识库的能力已经初步显现。然而在实际体验下，我认为这种“串联”仍然是不完整的，仍然有不少“割裂感”，而且这种“割裂感”很多时候导致的后果是交互的不自然，让很多操作不那么自然、顺手，从而分散注意力，导致关注重点不在于内容、而是部分分散到了完成操作上，影响实际投入学习的效率。而这点实际上能带来的问题是很大的。知识管理、知识库打造实在是一个太大的话题，个人也仅是凭自己的经验所做的思考，在近期将琐碎的所思形诸笔墨。以下是个人一些不成熟的见解，在短短的文章里难以完全表述出来，还希望后续可以有更多和官方交流的机会。
不得不说，MarginNote在软件的设计上，对于如何获取、学习、积累知识，甚至是主动创造知识上是有深刻的理解的，随着使用时间不断深入我越发佩服MarginNote的设计哲学之富有深意。这篇文章主要结合个人使用感受讨论学习、积累知识、打造知识库的方面MN可以优化的地方。
个人使用MarginNote大致有两种场景（当然本人是人文学科的专业，也许与理科不同，纯属个人感受）：一种是零散的、不需要进行结构化的，另一种是知识型的、需要逐步构建一个知识体系的。两种场景的区分往往是和学习内容相关的。例如单纯的学习外语，那么把单词、释义、原文中出现这个单词的句子做成卡片，以便后续导入卡片组/Anki复习即可，不需要专门的整理脑图。例如单纯的阅读文学作品，通常没有或者不需要一个明确的框架，仅需要品读、批注、摘录即可，依托MarginNote的定位跳转功能，方便回溯到摘录的句子所在的原文语境，依托科学的算法也更容易记忆摘录语句。而和专业相关的理论、教程等等，具有一个清晰的框架，则适合深入研究、需要搭建知识框架和体系。当然这个区分只是相对的，当然是可以对外语词汇进…</span>

                    <span>2021 年 10 月 24 日，Android 玩机圈内无人不知的玩机工具 Magisk 突然有了新动态：其开发者 John Wu 更新了一条 推文，宣布推出全新的 Magisk 金丝雀（canary）版本。它虽然并非正式版，但给玩机圈带来的喜悦却胜过以往任何一个版本。
这种喜悦近似于久旱逢甘霖。
时间回到 21 年 5 月，Magisk 开发者 John Wu 通过社交平台透露自己即将加入 Google，负责 Android 平台的安全工作。John Wu 此前有在 Apple 的实习经历，对 Android 安全领域也颇为熟悉，Google 择才而用、Wu 求仁得仁，这本来是值得庆祝的事。但在他公布自己获得新工作的 推文 下，除了寥寥的几则祝福，大多数关注者都在询问另外一个问题 —— Magisk 将何去何从？
Twitter @topjohnwu
Magisk 可以获取设备的 root 权限，凭借其独特的模块挂载方式，在 Xposed 等老牌玩机工具陷入泥潭之际 Magisk 反倒跟随 Android 系统渡过了好几个大版本更新，以其广泛的设备兼容性和强大的模块生态逐渐成为每一个 Android 玩家的必备工具。
因此开发者 John Wu 在 Magisk 上做的工作一直以来也如同攻向 Android 和 Google 服务的一把长矛，在 Google 的新职位，却又赋予了他 Android 平台安全持盾人的全新身份。「以子之矛陷子之盾」的戏话会在现实发生吗？作为 Google 人，Wu 有访问大部分公司代码的权限，Google 会允许 John Wu 继续开发 Magisk 吗？
State of Magisk: 2021
正如很多人所预料的那样，Magisk 最初的情况并不乐观。
对于网友的问题，Wu 先是回复称自己的 Magisk 开发不会受影响，不久却删除…</span>

和终端打过交道的读者应该对每次输入命令前都会出现的提示符（Prompt）不陌生，它们可以承载诸如当前位置、用户名等有用的信息。不管是出于美观还是实用的目的，自定义提示符都能给终端那枯燥的黑白界面添一抹色彩。
本文的主角 Oh my posh 正是这样一款终端 Prompt 个性化工具，虽然肇始于同类工具 Oh My Zsh，但当更新到 5.0 版本时，重新设计的 Oh my posh 已经摆脱平台的桎梏，支持了 Windows、GNU/Linux（WSL）、macOS 三个系统上的 PowerShell、bash、zsh 等终端。
下文将展示 Oh my posh 的效果，然后介绍它在不同系统和终端上的安装配置方式。
效果
Oh my posh 预置了数十款主题，项目官网有这些主题的 预览。安装并配置好工具后，打开终端即可看到效果。其中既有以文字为主的简约主题，例如 wopian、material：
wopianmaterial
也有辅以彩色背景和字体的醒目主题，例如 jandedobbeleer 和 craver：
jandedobbeleercraver
若不满意现有的主题，工具也支持加载自定义主题，其语法相较于 PowerShell 等终端默认提供的语法要简单不少。而除了能讨好用户的视觉，Oh my posh 的一些主题增加的 Git 项目状态预览等信息也比较实用。
安装
主题多姿多彩并没有让 Oh my posh 的安装变得复杂。它在各个平台上的安装方式流程是大致一致的，分为三步：按需安装字体 &gt; 安装 Oh my posh &gt; 修…</span>

在过去一年里，我读了很多 PKM（个人知识管理）有关的书籍和文章，并依据学习到的知识。结合自己的阅读需求，调整我的阅读工作流。
随着阅读内容的变化，新工具的出现，我的阅读工作流也在不断更新迭代。写这篇文章，是为了分享在 2021 年底这个时间点，我在用的阅读工作流。
开门见山，直接上图：

我把我的阅读工作流，分为了七步：
信息源-&gt;稍后阅读-&gt;划线批注-&gt;临时笔记-&gt;永久笔记（知识库）-&gt;回顾系统-&gt;创作输出
文章内容将对每一步使用的方法和工具进行介绍：
01 信息源
我日常阅读的内容 ，包括文章、书籍和动态。
文章
文章是我日常读的最多的阅读材料，我会从 Newsletter、公众号、blogger 或是朋友推荐的文章中筛选出我感兴趣的文章进行阅读。
在我关注的领域（效率工具、互联网、商业），我会保证我的信息源是最优质的。每两周我也会在我阅读的文章中，挑选出有用或有趣的文章，在 我的 Newsletter《草稿拾遗》中推荐。如果你也对这些领域感兴趣，可以关注我的公众号或将这份 Newsletter 订阅到你的邮箱。
书籍
书籍相较于文章，内容更加系统。想要系统地学习一个领域，离不开阅读书籍。
阅读非虚构类的书籍时，我追求的是高效阅读和记录，会优先选择电子书，便于记笔记和存档；阅读非虚构类书籍，如散文或是小说时，我则会选择纸质书更加容易沉浸在作者构建的世界中，享受阅读的乐趣。
动态
除了文章与书籍，推特/即刻/微博/豆瓣等社交媒体上，还有许多 KOC/KOL 的动态也值得一读。
动态的篇幅或许非常短，却是作者思想的浓缩，且实时性…</span>

Google Pixel 6/Pro 现已支持通过摄像头检测心率及呼吸频率
Google 于 11 月 15 日向 向 Pixel 6 和 Pixel 6 Pro 用户的 Goggle Fit 健康管理软件推送了两项新功能，分别为让用户在无需佩戴智能手表等可穿戴设别的情况下使用手机后置摄像头，通过识别用户食指上的细微变化来检测用户的心率，以及通过手机前置摄像头，通过检测用户的胸腔的起伏情况以获取用户的呼吸频率。据悉用户在打开新版 Google Fit 后，从页面顶部健康信息区域向下滑动到「发现」区域，找到「检查心率」功能卡片，点击卡片上的「开始」按钮，并将食指触碰后置摄像头即可开始心率监测。据悉在外界光线充足的情况下，心率检测的准确性会非常高，而在较暗的地方，最后的结果会有大约 30 bpm 的偏差。来源

                    <span>Microsoft is rolling out a new Media Player app for Windows 11 Insiders enrolled in the Dev channel. The company had initially shown off the app during a Windows Insider webcast, which it then quickly hid before publishing it again. Now, it’s finally available, and it carries version number 11.2110.34.0. This app requires Windows 11

                    <span>九阴真经下卷，论文实操。
此文用于分享一下一个老博士的科学写作经验。本博士写作水平只能说是将将及格，因此不敢舔着脸好为人师，此文仅当做一种信息交流，以供后来者扬弃。场面话言尽于此，下面我将正式从头到尾讲讲我的心得。
哲学原则
最初尝试科学写作的人，也大致了解文章分为abstract, introduction, related works, approaches, experiments, (optional) applications, conclusion 这几章。但是具体写起来，科研小白们，包括我自己一开始，都是一样无从下手的。经过这么多年混下来，终于初悟此道。
一个科研小白，最常用的思维是线性而非层次化的。因此，他对于项目的理解往往是我干了A所以有a，然后干了B所以有b，然后我又干了CDE，最后我的系统是ABCDE，发现厉害了。然后谈related work，ABCDE是related work，了事了。对，你是厉害了和了事了，但听者什么也没学到。一个好的论文，原则是用最少的文字最精准的传达关于项目的知识。
小白可能不服气——我都说了ABCDE了，该说的都说了，不然你让我怎么描述知识呀？！这时，我极其想给他推荐几篇柏拉图和亚里士多德的作品，不过我就简单搬运一下：

Theaetetus, 知识是正确的见解加与其他易混淆事物差异的解释。
Philebus/Timaeus，无限的多是一种混沌，有限的一是美的。
Statesman，本质的划分导致精确的概念的讨论。
Categories，普遍的还是个例的，必然的还是偶然的？
Prior Analytics, 三段论。
Posterior Analytics（尚在写作中），证明是从在先的必然的结论出发的三段论。定义是本源实体的最先描述。

由此，ABCDE模式的几个显著缺陷就明了了。一方面，这虽然详述了你的方案，但读者并不知…</span>

Linear Programming consists of two parts. The objective function is a linear equation and a set of constraints. The objective function or the linear equation will either have to be maximized or minimized.
Eg: Consider a bookseller has 3 types of books (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). The Physics Book makes a profit of 10\$, Chemistry makes a profit of 5\$ and Biology makes a profit of 2\$. If we wanted to write a equation for the total profit it would look something like below

We would need to maximize the above equation. Right now it doesn’t have any…</span>

                    <span>Team building for remote teams is a tricky subject, especially for developer teams.  Often, software engineer team members aren&#x27;t keen on traditional team-building activities such as, well, socialising in person over drinks, playing rounders or driving go karts.
If engineers are already spending their days in front of a screen, it might seem an interesting idea, but go with it for a second... what about an online escape room where the team has to hack, code and puzzle their way out?
I built /dev/esc to give dev teams a challenging, geeky way to do what they do in their day jobs.  Only without JIRA, requirements, specifications, meetings, managers.  It&#x27;s unashamedly nerdy - my premise is that programmers will enjoy the reward of cracking a team game in about an hour, especially if the subject matter is code, data or APIs.
I&#x27;d love to hear from you in the comments.  Am I onto a good idea here?  What feedback do you have for me?
Have you been involved in team-building activities and seen successful ideas?  Or unsuccessful attempts?  I think developer teams are underserved by traditional off-site activities and would love to learn more from your experiences.</span>

                    <span>My week started with way more work than expected.
I started today off by finishing the JS Basics portion of FreeCodeCamp. These lessons seem to be very well structured, so I&#x27;m going to continue with this course until I complete it.
Today I started the process of linting my entire project with ESLint (AirBnB rules). While the linting itself was not a problem, I ran into some serious dependency tree errors and really got lost in the forest of it. Solving these errors was a really long winded process and it ate up a lot of the time I had set aside for working. In the future, I will need to be much more careful when setting dependencies; I didn&#x27;t realize how convoluted it could get to fix.
As is usual, Tuesday is my busiest day of the week and this Tuesday will be no exception. My plans are to continue with FreeCodeCamp&#x27;s tutorials and any spare time I get to work on my project will be a blessing.
Dealing with dependencies in React. I need to learn more about the config files, especially package.json and the different ways I can go about solving dependency errors. If others hadn&#x27;t run into the same issues as I, I really don&#x27;t know how I would have solved my dependency problems today.

                    <span>As much of a buzz term as blockchain has become, it&#x27;s still a great technology. To take some of the magic out of it, blockchain is essentially a distributed database. A blockchain is made of blocks that contain data and those blocks are chained together across multiple machines, which make up the distributed network.
In this article, we&#x27;ll build a distributed app in the Redwood framework that handles video data. We&#x27;ll make a smart contract to handle our blockchain interactions. Then we&#x27;ll set up the Redwood distributed app that will work with the blockchain.
A DApp is very similar to a regular app. The only difference is that the back-end runs on a decentralized network instead of a central server that might host APIs or other services. It uses the Ethereum blockchain to store data and it …</span>

                    <span>What am I working on?


The last 2-3 weeks I have been working on Pull Requests for my Open Source class at Seneca College. Previously, during Hacktoberfest I contributed to a tool called toad-scheduler which is an in-memory NodeJS scheduling tool.
In this tool, I helped fix a bug about setInterval() limit throwing an error with anything over than 24.5 days. During this PR, I had to write a test using Jest framework to handle the long intervals and make sure it was firing the task correctly.
For my next PR, I wanted to work on the tool again with Igor Savin. I asked him what I could do to help this time around. One of the options he mentioned was adding Browser based testing using Headless Chrome.
I asked him why exactly we needed to do that considering there was already a full suite of Je…</span>

今天中国谷歌开发者大会线上如期举行，其中主要包含了 Android 、TF、Play、AR、Flutter 等相关的内容，本篇主要介绍主会场的部分内容。
本次大会看起来基本都是录播的感觉，我比较关心 Android 和 Flutter 的内容。
Android
Android 12 的发布主要在如下三方面进行了优化调整：用户界面、性能、隐私。

关于用户界面谷歌提供了 Material You 的设计，可以说是  Material Design 的 V3 模式。
从我个人看，这个对我们国内影响不大，毕竟大部分 App 都不遵循这个设计规范····

Android 12 同时更注重多种设备屏幕的适配，比如 WPS 就兼容了折叠屏的工作模式。

关于 MAD 相信大家也不陌生，Modern Android Development，谷歌开发者公众号今年就推送了一些列的 MAD Skills 的文章，其中就包含 Jetpack 常见的 Navigatoin、WorkManager、Room、DataStore、Macrobenchmark 等等的内容。

还有针对 Andorid Wear 的介绍和合作品牌介绍。

Play
Google Play 这次最主要是介绍了 Data safety section 相关，也是后续上架会慢慢开始强制性要求的内容。

我在《对开发者而言《个人信息保护法》更新究竟是什么？如何应对适配？》就有对这部分内容进行过介绍。

AR
更方便的和更强大的 ARCore SDK，可以更便捷地调用，不出意外蹭了一波元宇宙的热度。


TensorFlow
举例国内外使用 TensorFlow 的例子：
知衣 App 使用它让用户可以在线上使用衣服
58同城使用它做车牌识别和车型等。

Web
更加注重隐私权限的沙盒。

介绍 WebAssembly 能更好接入 C++ 代码，让渲染更加流畅和优秀。


PWA 可以更方便同步用户的操作，比如打开文件。


Flutter
官方介绍 Flutter 已经成为了最大的跨平台开发框架，谷歌 Play 上超过 350,000  App 使用 Flutter 。

例如字节跳动就是最大的 Flutter 应用开发商之一，它名下就有 &gt;70 款 app 使用了 Flutter 开发。

腾讯不只在微信和企业微信手机端使用了 Flutter ，在 PC 端也开始使用 Flutter 支持，甚至在游戏领域。


官方接收的反馈， Flutter 提高了 30% 的生产力，近期的版本主要在性能，可用性和插件方面进行了更新。


对于 Flutter Web 而言，CanvasKit 渲染器已经支持稳定版发布了，接下来 Flutter 将逐步缩小 App 和 Web 之间的差异。


比如 Web 的摄像头插件已经得到支持。

PC 端依然还是 beta 阶段，不过可以在 stable 分支通过配置使用，目前还是处于继续优化的阶段。

PC 端的改建主要是在 文本编辑、鼠标键盘、滚动和无障碍这四个方面进行改进，另外之前介绍过的 ubuntu 就默认开始支持 Flutter 了。



Flutter 广告插件的发布。

支持导入第三方包的 dart pad 现在可以 beta 试用，官方也推荐了一些状态管理的包，比如：provider、flutter_bolc、rivepod。



Flutter 官方网站的改版，更多资源和例子的官网。
官网现在还提供 Flutter 学徒的免费教程哦：flutter.dev


总的来说这次大会主会场的内容不多，并且基本上看起来都是录制的画面，分会场也是开放了录制的视频，可以重播，有需要的可以直接查看：  https://developersummit.googlecnapps.cn</span>

                    <span>简介
我基于stackedit的markdown编辑器制作了这款插件，由于官方markdown插件非常不友好，存在公式无法正确识别等一些问题，所以制作了这款插件，补充官方插件的不足。stackedit是采用了mermaid、katex引擎，满足一部分人对mermaid的需求。（Mermaid 是一个用于画流程图、状态图、时序图、甘特图的库，使用 JS 进行本地渲染，广泛集成于许多 Markdown 编辑器中。)
myMarkDown的使用效果
公式
与官方markdown插件不同，$输入你的公式$两个美元符号之间是内联公式，$$你的公式$$是块公式。
流程图
本款markdown插件采用mermaid引擎，所以想制作流程图请学习使用mermaid。
表格
与官方的markdown插件一样。
痛点需求
官方的markdown插件存在很多bug，目前这款stackedit还没发现bug；
由于窗口大小的限制，所以不同于官方markdown插件将左边为输入区，右边为preview，而是采用了整个窗口都为输入区，需要查看preview时点击一个按钮即可查看。

不容错过的新 App
虽然少数派一直在为大家发发现和介绍各平台上的优质 App，但仍有不少设计、功能、交互、体验都非常优秀的 App，还没有被我们发掘和介绍。它们可能是一款老 App，也可能是近期上架的新 App，我们会在这里介绍给你。
Automa：将繁琐的网页操作自动化

平台：Chrome
关键词：浏览器、标签页、自动化

@化学心情下2：脚本语言的好处在于可以将一些需要反复操作的过程进行自动化操作，只需要编写好相关的运行模式，接下来的事情就让脚本来跑就行。相比用来直接开发成一款程序，这种基于脚本的自动化操作即具有一定的灵活性，同时还有很高的效率。
其实这和 iOS / macOS 上的快捷指令如出一辙，只不过快捷指令在编写指令时类似现在流行的「低代码」平台——通过可视化的步骤创建来实现脚本程序的编写。不过快捷指令往往都是系统层级的工具，如果我想自动化操作网页，那么下面这款名为 Automa 的浏览器扩展可能会更为实用。

简单来说，在 Automa 编写各种自动运行的指令的形式结合来「快捷指令」以及低代码的平台。比如我想要创建一个「一键搜索少数派」的自动化命令，那么首先打开 Automa 的仪表盘页面，点击右上方的「New workflow」来创建一个自动化任务。

之后点击这个脚本进入到编辑页面中，将左侧业务块中找到「New tab」拖入到右侧的编辑区域中，然后将它和最初触发模块「Trigger」用…</span>

                    <span>对于女生而言，一年四季都必不可少的衣物，除了跟男生一样的必需品内裤外，内衣的地位也是当仁不让。而且内衣的舒适度对于女性身体体验上也是占据着非常大的比重。
作为一个运动爱好者的女生代表，尝试过修身养性的「慢」运动瑜伽，也接触过挥汗淋漓的拳击和 MMA，当然还有我的最爱——力量训练和举铁。细数这些不同种类的运动场景，我们总被提醒「要穿运动服」，但其实真正最必不可缺的就是女性运动内衣。
有了它，就可以在畅快淋漓（或痛苦）运动时不用去顾忌身体上的「别扭」。

为什么需要运动内衣
运动内衣和普通内衣的穿着目的其实是不同的，普通内衣更多是为了「保护基础形体」，即普通内衣只是在水平方向向拖住胸部，防止胸部下垂或外扩，部分内衣可达到收缩聚拢效果，在穿衣搭配上更多变。
而运动内衣因其搭配场景的需求，更多作用于对抗活动过程中的地心引力。因为在运动过程中，不管是瑜伽的稳固核心、猫式、上犬式还是长跑过程中的幅度摆臂等，女性胸部都会因其自身结构的独特性而产生晃动。这点相信大家在中学上体育课时就有所感受，跑 800 米甚至是立定跳远都会造成胸部在普通内衣内的来回抖动。
从支撑性角度来看，普通内衣更讲究修饰胸形、聚拢、美观，更偏向日常生活场景。而运动内衣的主要优势就是强支撑和固定性，这在运动场景上是高度匹配的。减少胸部晃动，既可以对身体减少一定程度的伤害，也可以避免公共场合的形体尴尬。
同时，运动内衣因为要满足运动场景的各类需求，比如出汗量大、运动幅度大，尤其是在锁骨、胸口和腋下很容易堆积汗水，所以在物料材质的选择上一般会看重透气性和可延展性。同时在肩带宽窄度和下胸围包边材质上都会进行专门的处理，保证后期穿戴的稳定和亲肤度。
运动时穿普通内衣难道就不能锻炼了吗？
胸部在人体内部构造中更接近流体的状态（不管大小）。查阅资料显示，女生跑步时胸部晃动呈现出 ∞ 形，即使是一个 A Cup 的女生，在没有运动内…</span>

                    <span>过去的十年间，我们听音乐的方式也发生了很大的变化：坚持转录、下载、手动整理归类音乐文件然后使用播放器和手机本地播放的人越来越少，选择 QQ 音乐、网易云、Spotify、Apple Music 等流媒体音乐服务的人越来越多。
不过由于各种原因，流媒体音乐服务依然难以替代本地曲库在音乐发烧友心中的地位。毕竟不用为了听不同音乐人的作品同时安装多个 App 并在其间来回切换，也不用怀揣自己的歌单会不会因为版权忽然「变灰」的那份忐忑。
如果你依然坚守着本地播放这种「古早」的听歌方式，喜欢将喜爱的作品收藏至本地而非云端，选对本地音乐播放器则可以说是决定整个听歌体验的最为关键的一环。好在 Android 平台从来不缺优秀的本地音乐播放器，在 Phonograph 几乎停更、PowerAMP 颜值始终捡不起来的 2021 年，我们又有哪些值得一试的新选择呢？
本文为你一一盘点。
Stellio：全面定制你的听音风格
表面看起来界面简洁清爽的 Stellio，背后却有着较为复杂多样的交互操作逻辑，比如在主界面右滑显示侧边栏、从底部播放栏连续上划依次进入「正在播放」页与播放清单页、在「正在播放」页按钮之外的任意位置长按联网搜索与修改专辑图、双击任意位置联网搜索与修改歌词等等操作均不是那么的直观，刚上手使用时可能会令人感到无所适从。
Stellio 当然深知这个问题，因此在初次使用时，它会在每个界面中以浮窗的形式展示详细的操作指引，告诉用户在各个界面、按钮上滑动、长按、双击分别能实现什么功能。经过一段时间的频繁使用形成习惯后操作效率还是比较高的，若有遗忘也能重新查看操作指引。

均衡器是 Stellio 的一个重头功能，它支持 12 个频段的手动调整以及内置的 16 种预设音效模式，可以更加精细化地来调节歌曲的音乐试听风格。另外它还提供了增益控制功能，可以手动来增强歌曲中的高、中、低音，或是控…</span>

我主业是程序员，最近做了床蚕丝被。
抱着严谨求真的态度，我查阅了 8 本丝绸与纺织领域的教材及近 100 篇纺织领域论文、期刊文献。
结论是：蚕丝被确实很好，蚕丝被行业确实很烂。

我是个独立开发者。就是那种自己做产品、画设计稿、写代码，然后把做好的 App 放到苹果或安卓应用商店里售卖的人。有点像四惠东早上卖煎饼果子的，一个人热气腾腾的活得像一支队伍。
6 个月前，我决定做一床蚕丝被。因为我想买一床很好的蚕丝被，又不愿意花不明不白的钱。多年的程序员工作经验告诉我，学习轮子最快的方式就是自己造个轮子。于是我就花半年时间做了一床非常好的蚕丝被，叫「云惹」。
当然，还有一个更重要的原因是我开发的 App 不怎么赚钱（虽然很优秀），我想卖被子补贴家用。
的确好用么
随便搜索下蚕丝被，就会得到满屏的彩虹屁。高频词汇是纤维皇后、人体第二肌肤、贴身保暖、控温透气、富含 18 种氨基酸、美容养颜。
抛开云山雾罩的玄学语言，科学的角度看，关系到一床被子舒适度的关键指标有这些：保暖性、贴身舒适性、透气性、及部分附加特性（如抗菌保健等）。我们就逐项对比看看蚕丝被是个什么水准。
常见的被子填充有 5 种：化纤、棉花、羊毛、蚕丝、羽绒。市面顶着五花八门名字的被子，七孔、九孔、羽丝绒、大豆纤维被等，实质上都是各类化学纤维被。
保温性
作为自然界罕见的没毛生物，人睡觉盖被子核心目的就是保暖。

从纤维本身的热传导系数看，系数越高意味着越容易导热，保暖性越差。常见物质里，空气保温性最好（所以中空玻璃有很好的隔热性），水的保温性最差。
蚕丝与羊毛相当，优于棉纤维…</span>

It’s not all about the flagships though, as the OnePlus Nord N20 5G is the latest OnePlus phone to leak, and it’s packing a design overhaul. The iPhone 13’s boxy design is almost certainly

                    <span>《镜》系列是沧月老师的经典小说，也是不少人的童年回忆。这部作品不仅有宏大的背景结构，更有个性鲜明的角色和他们之间错综复杂的关系。因此我认为，如何用视听语言来复现书粉们梦中的云荒世界是本次动画化的重点，重中之重放在了角色的塑造上（下面会详细说明）。
不同于其它的作品，云荒在地理设置上有相当的包容感，这就给了作品的美术很大的想象空间。充满神性的白塔和人来人往的桃源郡是完全不同的风格，因此在建筑和场景风格上本作可以做出相当华丽却又充满异域风情的视效，相信会给观众耳目一新的感觉。



我想重点讲讲角色。
在人物塑造方面，沧月老师的笔触是相当细腻的，这体现在每个角色都有自己丰满的个人故事和鲜明的性格特征，同时在小说中又并没有占据极大的篇幅就完成了群像式的角色塑造，这给我们动画制作带来了相当的挑战。为了塑造好人物，我们主要做了三方面的工作。
其一是剧情的取舍，如何在固定的篇幅下取舍故事是一个很大的难点。因为小说的内容十分丰厚，在有限的时长里，如何保证核心剧情的串联，又同时尽量保持每个角色的高光时刻，花费了我们相当的功夫。
第二个难点在于小说的叙事顺序是穿插的，天马行空的笔触结合宏大的故事让行文非常浪漫。但如果原原本本的按小说顺序照搬到周更的动画上，就容易抬高观看的门槛。我个人一直都认为动画最大的作用是做IP放大，让更多人了解和喜欢一个新故事；因此怎么做时间线和故事线的合并、让没看过《镜》系列的新观众也能轻松入坑是另一个攻略的重点。
第三，为了辅助二，如何保持角色立体的性格特征又对各自所处的阵营有归属感是美术方面发力的重点。我们制作时一边参考了小说中对于角色的描绘，一边给予了每个阵营鲜明的核心美术特征。比如鲛人族的角色因为国家破灭，长期被奴役压迫，几个主要出场角色又身负重任，因此在色彩选取上偏深偏暗，不会整体给成太小清新的感觉；就算是统领复国军的如意夫人，她符合表面职业的参考花魁的装扮，也是在她深色的裙摆基础上来作为点缀的。

                    <span>很幸运能够参加《镜·双城》动画的制作，《镜·双城》原作构建了一个奇幻世界，富有古风的韵味，又具有科技的元素，在这样广阔的背景下，活跃着许多精彩的人物，纯真善良的那笙，背负使命的苏摩，坚强温柔的白璎，机智幽默的真岚……每一个角色都具有自己独一无二的魅力，我在阅读原作时就非常喜爱这些角色，为故事的走向和人物的命运扼腕，被书中的情感深深地打动。



同时我们在制作时也在思考这个问题——故事线索细腻繁杂，由于不同媒介的表达方式不同，在改编之时很难涵盖小说中的全部内容，如果力求面面俱到，又会让整个作品冗长而缺乏主次，因此取舍变成了一个需要谨慎考虑的问题。不改变原作的本质进行删改，将故事的核心和人物的神韵传达出来，讲好主角们的故事，这是我们在制作中的一个重要目标，为了这个目标，我们反复阅读原作，梳理故事情节，在制作中推敲每一个细节是否符合原作精神。

我们希望，当这些角色和故事以另一种形式展现在他们面前时，这部作品能够回应老读者们的期待。
也希望新观众能在与片中人物一同探索云荒大陆之时享受到同等的乐趣。最后还希望大家能多多支持镜双城这部动画，同时也希望大家通过镜的动画找到自己内心的那份热情。

                    <span>作为《镜》的书粉，能参与《镜》的制作很兴奋，在整个制作中，我们在开发时阶段对原著做了大量调研和规划，努力还原大家眼中的云荒，这个奇幻大陆。
在设计初始我们考虑到镜是不同于修仙武侠风格的奇幻作品，云荒庞大的世界观本身作为镜系列的一大亮点，在本次的开发中，我们也在美术开发中针对这个亮点进行了系统开发。例如双城这部动画中出现的比较有代表性的空桑族，首先古代空桑作为比较尊贵的种族在服饰的设计上我们采用了比较端庄的广袖交襟制式，也加入了现代剪裁的风格，在服饰材料上采用了大量锦缎。因为锦缎的特点是密实厚重。而在征服海国后的空桑则以束口易于行动，以及绫罗和鲛绡等轻便织物为主。其中白璎的婚服和常服就是比较典型的代表。

中州族在设计，比较有代表性的是我们的主角那笙，整体服饰风格我们借鉴了苗族的银饰、苗绣、蜡染等苗族服饰元素。同时考虑到了中州的人文，当地盛产羽毛动物多以羽毛作为装饰品生产，所以在那笙的头饰设计上我们增加了羽毛饰品。

另外大家比较关心的苏摩所在的鲛人族我们也做了细致的设计，蓝发碧眼是鲛人统一特征，考虑到原著设定鲛人族在创世之初选择了美貌和歌声，所以全员设计上我们都此为重心进行设计。由于鲛人命运的多元性，我们根据每个出现的角色都进行了定制设计，例如苏摩从少年到成年，从送给白璎到离开空桑，再到桃源郡如意赌坊和如意夫人汇合，我们为苏摩设计了三套不一样的服饰，都是根据苏摩当时的境遇而设计。另一个比较有代表性的鲛人角色，炎汐，作为鲛人复国军的左权使，在执行任务的时候需要灵活和轻便的特征，所以我们采用了软皮革材质的盔甲设计，在纹理和结构上采用了鳞片和鱼鳍纹理等鲛人特有的元素。在裁剪上也采用了更加修身的裁剪方式来突出鲛人俊美的特质。 

最后希望大家在《镜·双城》这部动画中感受到不一样的美术设计，同时请大家多多支持镜双城，我们会继续努力的。

                    <span>沧月老师的《镜》系列自问世以来一直是深受广大读者喜爱的一套作品，书中充满了瑰丽的想象，为我们呈现了云荒这个奇妙的世界，富有魅力的人物以及丰富的故事。《镜·双城》作为这一系列的第一部，我们非常幸运能得到这个机会将其改编成动画，将书中的内容以一种不同载体呈现，我们也非常期待以动画的方式向更多的观众展示镜系列的故事。
《镜·双城》这一季我们尊重原著，做了群像戏的改编。同时我们也安排了一些有趣的剧情，例如真岚断手和那笙在去往云荒的路上。我们安排了很多小互动。


在动画制作方面，由于《镜》的本身题材属于玄幻，文戏也比较多，制作挑战比较大。大量的文戏需要更细致的角色演出来丰富效果，如何将每个角色的性格在一些小动作和表情上来凸显是一个很大的难题，比如我们在制作三维模型后，针对那笙比较活泼的性格，做了多次的绑定测试以及各种表情模拟。

本季制作除了动画方面我们也十分重视剧情，叙事流畅 ，剧情环环相扣是我们发力的主要方向。同时也希望能将镜中庞大的世界观通过故事、画面传达给观众。当然在改编的同时我们也尽可能的贴近原著，尽量还原大家比较关心的世界观设定和人物设定以及故事线。就像大家期待的一样，希望《双城》是开始，我们也希望有机会制作《镜》的整个系列，将完整的云荒大陆呈现在大家眼前。 希望大家能多支持多期待多关注我们哦。
感谢大家对《镜·双城》动画的支持，希望大家能在镜中找到自己的抉择、勇气、责任与爱。

                    <span>我是幻维数码斗破苍穹动画项目的导演赵丙乐，今天我和大家简单聊聊斗破动画的那些事。
       《斗破苍穹》可以说是我接触网文小说的开端，萧炎从低谷逆袭成长到炎帝的经历和面对世界的勇气让人过目难忘，当初看的时候爽到让我几个月连肝两遍。所以斗破也是我一路接触的网文小说之中心中地位最高的一部。

       原本斗一动画化的时候我就有加入项目的机会，但可惜由于当时制片进度无法匹配导致失之交臂。但一切似乎冥冥之中的注定，时隔几个月后，幻维数码的斗二又再一次给我了这样的机会，所以终于能够结缘斗破系列动画，这样的机会也让我非常珍惜。


       关于斗破的故事，我认为他的一大魅力在于能够吸引不同年龄层次的读者，因为随着人生阅历的不同，无论少年，青年甚至中年受众都会有自己独到的感受，因此关于动画剧集的创作，我们也是尽可能的去唤起大家对于小说原作的那种激情，所以我们使用了常规番加特别番的产品模式，在确保正常剧情更新推进的同时，对于重点剧情我们会更多关注角色的情绪和成长，以及各种名场面的塑造，让斗气大陆的世界观更真实立体。

       而三年之约作为整部小说的重大高潮情节，是我本身读小说时最热血沸腾的一个段落，因此抱着回馈广大粉丝的初衷，我们决心把他打造成史上最长特别篇，也为自己设立了一个全新挑战。所以我们不敢懈怠，有压力，也有担心会遗漏细节毁掉这样一个万众瞩目的焦点。本次斗破三年之约的成片，整季超过4820个镜头，其中超过80%以上的打斗和特效镜头也确实拉满了制作难度，可以说这样的创作难度和执行规格完全不输一部常规的动画电影，因此在大家爷青回的同时，我们整个创作团队在背后也付出了无数的汗水。


       集数设置的时候我们拟定了很多方案。比如打点萧炎与纳兰嫣然的比试结束做两集特别篇、一上二上云岚宗结束等。但最终我们还是选择了萧炎躲避云岚宗的追捕，离开加玛帝国的段落。因为…</span>

                    <span>一、LPL和LCK的恩怨情仇
英雄联盟总决赛（简称S赛，“S”即Season，意为赛季。S+数字，也常被用来指代赛季那一年）是由全世界地区联赛派出代表自己赛区最强实力的几支俱乐部队伍，众多豪门新贵争夺一个冠军的超级大赛，一年一届，目前是英雄联盟这款最高荣誉，也是具有最大知名度和影响力的电竞赛事之一。简单来说，这个赛事对于LOL这款游戏来说，就相当于世界杯对足球的意义。
今年是第十一届S赛。第一届是2011年举办的。
除去混沌初开，菜鸡互啄的前两届S赛， LCK（League Of Legends Champions Korea，英雄联盟韩国冠军联赛）及其前身因为韩国那边对电竞的重视，连拿了S3,4,5,6,7的冠军，当了5年的第一赛区。
LOL（League Of Legends )这款09年末推出的美国游戏，是腾讯（完整收购LOL开发商拳头的全资母公司）最主打的游戏之一，也是世界上最热门的网络游戏之一。中国大陆拥有基数最大的LOL玩家，也对LOL赛事拥有最高的热情，而代表中国大陆电竞的LPL赛区，却被LCK整整压制了5年，七年无冠。
这五年，每一年LPL队伍铩羽而归，队员大多都垂头丧气，无颜面对江东父老，有不少选手因为顶不住压力，打完S赛就引退了。
“抗韩”也成了老一辈LOL电竞人和中国大陆玩家的心病。
S1因为国服刚公测，所以跟国内没太大关系。但是老牌豪门WE和IG已经关注这款新游戏，成立了分部。S1初代冠军由欧洲的FNC获得。
S2，WE和IG参加了S2，但没有取得好成绩，中国台湾地区队伍TPA夺冠。但是WE在后面的IPL5为LPL赛区带来了第一个世界冠军，也给这款游戏带来了更大的关注度。同时，这一年韩国赛区的崛起已经显而易见。
S3,S4时期，确实LPL赛区的游戏理解不够到位和选手硬实力不足。S3 SKT的强势崛起，让LPL观众知道LOL原来还能这样玩？S4三星双雄…</span>

                    <span>敷面膜有用，但不要过度沉溺于相信面膜的补水，相反，要警惕一些面膜所谓的即时“效果”
最近刚好冬天到了，气温骤降，天气也变得异常干燥，很多小可爱的脸开始不淡定了吧？都再疯狂的补水吧，双十一是不是囤了一堆一堆的面膜和其他补水产品，试图靠它们躺过干燥的冬天？
当你们随便拿着一瓶动辄几百甚至上千的补水产品在脸上拍拍打打的时候，你们有没有想过：你们的皮肤真的需要这样吗？这样的“补水”到底补进去了多少水？补进去的水真的有用吗？还有，怎么补水才算科学？
皮肤真的需要补水吗？
说句大家都不愿相信面对的事实：其实我们的皮肤角质层乃至真皮层的水份大多都是通过体内的细胞和组织输送的，并不是通过外用涂抹化妆品获得的。尤其是我们的真皮层，它里面水量丰富、充沛，原则上说：真皮层其实完全不缺水的。所以不要相信什么深层补水，给真皮层补水的割韭菜的鬼话，通通都是骗人的。
来大家来看张图，这就是我们皮肤的含水量分布图。

真皮层不缺水，但是皮肤最外层的角质层就不一样了。角质层里面的水虽然也都大多来源于体内供给，但是由于毛孔和细胞间隙的存在，当受到外界因素（比如温度、湿度或者外力挤压）等影响时，角质层的水份是会被蒸发到环境中去的，所以角质层偶尔会缺水。那么它缺水的皮肤表征就是：皮肤干燥，蜕皮，紧绷甚至皮肤敏感。
虽然我们可以通过涂抹化妆水、敷面膜等各种方式给皮肤补水，但很可惜，与皮肤自身失去的水份相比，外用补给的水也只是杯水车薪。
所以大家会发现：我们要做的有效护肤，并不是给皮肤“补水”，而是要做好皮肤“锁水”。
“补水”和“锁水”，谁更重要？
“补水”和“锁水”很多人分不清，但其实他们两有本质的却别。
“补水”：是通过外用涂抹化妆品（尤其是敷面膜）来给角质层补水，浸润角质层，保湿角质层湿润的状态，维持其对应的一系列生理功能，比如皮肤修复以及担任屏障功能防御外界刺激。
“锁水”：则重在锁住肌肤的水份，不让它蒸发…</span>

前言
了解过设计模式的同学都知道，设计模式家族成员非常庞大，具体可以分为3类共23种设计模式
本文主要包括以下内容
六大设计原则的介绍
简单工厂、工厂方法与抽象工厂模式的区别
代理，装饰与适配器模式的区别
策略、状态与命令模式的区别
设计原则介绍
众所周知，5大设计原则一般有6个
单一职责原则(Single Responsibility Principle, SRP)
开闭原则(Open Close Principle, OCP)
里氏替换原则(Liskov Substitution Principle, LSP)
依赖倒置原则(Dependence Inversion Principle, DIP)
接口隔离原则(Interface Segregation Principle, ISP)
迪米特法则(Law of Demeter, LoD),又称最少知识原则(Principle of Least Knowledge)
其中，前5个原则称为SOLID原则
单一职责原则
单一职责原则很简单也很好理解：类的职责应该单一，一个方法只做一件事,这里就不多说了
开闭原则
开闭原则是说程序对扩展开放，对修改关闭：当你的程序需要扩展时，不应该修改原来的代码，而是可以添加一个类来扩展。
getPrice 方法，也可以增加一个子类，重写getPrice方法，通过高层模块，在打折时使用子类。
开闭原则的思想其实是将不变的地方封装起来，将可变的部分暴露出去，这样它们就不会混淆，还可以复用不变的部分，增加扩展性
里氏替换原则
里氏替换原则用一句话描述就是：所有引用基类的地方，必须能够使用其子类直接替换，换句话说，所有引用基类的地方必须透明地使用其子类对象。
Java中，引用基类的地方，本来就可以用子类替换，为什么要提出个原…</span>

                    <span>简介
插件开启之后，在文档中选中文字会自动打开外部浏览器搜索。
目前只支持文档选中搜索，不支持笔记、标注、脑图等。
下面分别提供了搜索引擎为Google、百度或者欧路词典app的版本供下载。也可按需要将main.js里的baseUrl自行修改为其他网站（需要网址）或者App（需要app的URL Scheme），可参考现有“研究”功能的自定义url。
自定义方法请看这一楼
请注意及时关闭插件，否则选中一次就会打开一次浏览器，你会疯的。

插件下载
Google搜索引擎
reresearch_Google_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
墙内可用Baidu搜索引擎
reresearch_Baidu_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
其实最有启发性的是这个：自动欧路词典app内搜索
reresearch_Eudic_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
自动在德语助手app内搜索
reresearch_Eudic_0.1.mnaddon (5.8 KB)
以上插件不可共用。使用前请打开“允许加载未认证插件”
动机
起因是看到了 Xiamumu的这个帖子 ，聊这个我就不困了。
点击文档内的超链接一直都会在“研究”窗口打开，需要再多按一次才能打开Safari，很不方便。
开放插件功能后其实我有在尝试做一个超链接直接用外部浏览器打开的小插件。但是由于以下原因搁置了：
1）没有开发文档，不知道MN内响应打开链接的是哪个通知；
2）即使有开发文档，即使我可以直接用外部浏览器打开链接，但是并不能禁用原本在MN内浏览器打开网页这个默认操作（我猜的，在初期给插件这么嚣张的权限肯定不合适）。
看到上文帖子里的需求正好跟我之前的尝试有重叠，所以就先做了。跟之前的InstantCopy一样，依然是代码上很简单的小插件。
为什么叫ReResearch
其实这个插件的功能跟MarginNote自带的“Research”功能非常相似，所以开玩笑叫ReResearch。
其实最合理的做法是未来开发组在MarginNote的“研究”功能多加一个允许默认外部打开的设置。
为什么不支持脑图、摘要、笔记？
很惭愧，因为主要把MN当成带翻译功能的pdf阅读器在用，很少用到脑图、笔记等功能，所以其实我分不清什么是笔记什么是摘要什么是标题什么是注释什么是卡片，更不用说开发了。
但是有了这个简单的版本做参考，支持其他模式也很容易，欢迎随意修改。
不足
开发文档其实还没开发，只能基于官方插件摸索，这个插件现在还很不灵活。
一方面特别暴力，选中任何文字都会直接打开浏览器搜索。其实很有必要加一些前提条件，比如最简单的颜色判断，但是现在颜色是哪个属性值都还未知。
另一方面，要修改搜索引擎/URL Scheme只能在代码里修改baseUrl变量。理想/成熟状况下插件应该有自己的偏好设置界面。目前还不知道是否会有插件偏好设置或者如何设置。软件的设置界面已经很丰富了，插件设置也塞进去将会很可怕。
开发问题
现在用的还是旧的openURL方法，该方法已被废弃，新方法为openURL:options:completionHandler:。主要问题是不知道如何使用JSB调用这个方法，只能等有时间再研究了。很可惜我对iOS开发的认知还停留在iOS7时代。</span>

                    <span>注：本文适用于对MN有一定经验、想对MN的产品逻辑有一种整体性理解的用户，因此本文不使用任何图例。
关于MN作为知识型软件的测评已经足够多了，每一个使用MN的人首先期待的，自然是如何用这个神品APP安排自己的学习，用它来整理自己的知识，让它成为第二大脑——这一时下对相似工具十分流行的期待。但是我发现，还没有什么人介绍MN逐渐从“知识型app”向“创造型app”的转变，并且在这条路上的探索越来越精深，而正是这一点，让MN变得非同凡响。
   MN是如何做的呢？它如何建构知识型体系，又如何建构创造型体系，以及如何把二者衔接起来的？——通过层层递进的使用方法和逻辑。

MN按照知识获取的流程，设计了多层次的阅读逻辑，并逐渐转变为具有输出能力的创造模式。
从脑图到文本。也就是说，在对文本重建逻辑后，文本的重要性让位于脑图重要性。由于脑图的直观和非线性，他更符合人脑的信息存储模式，因为人脑记忆信息不是线性，不是书本那样从第一页第一个字到最后一页最后一个字的，而是跳跃性、主次分明、统观的。书本文本形式仅仅是信息最便捷的载体，却不是信息最易读取的载体。由于脑图的这种特性，不论是复习，再次阅读或者是知识概览索引，都变得极为方便。当然，MN提供了比脑图更具逻辑性和条理性的“大纲”功能，可以加速信息查找。
在脑图的基本框架建立后，MN围绕此对脑图功能的可能性进行了探索。增加标题链接功能后，文本的关键信息提取则更上一层楼，特别是当学习新知识时，专有名词会成为理解的阻碍，或者在阅读外文文献，某些词汇需要注意或记忆，都可以用辞典功能进行摘取定义。当你学习的东西较少，这个功能是不起眼的，而如果你要获得新的知识（特别是在这个终身学习的时代），你需要定义的概念越多，它对你就越有用。这个辞典功能还可以链接到其他“学习”，这个时候，它就会带来出人意料的作用，这在后面的层次再说。
脑图本身是层级架构的，因此原则…</span>

                    <span>按：《迟早更新》是一档开播于 2016 年的中文播客，定位于「探讨科技、商业、设计和生活之间混沌关系」，旨在「能让熟悉的事物变得新鲜，让新鲜的事物变得熟悉」。
今年 10 月，《迟早更新》与播客平台小宇宙联合开展了一次「迟早公开」计划：该节目第 175 期《故事新编》将在小宇宙平台上首发，并以 9.9 元的价格销售。《迟早更新》承诺，如果付费人数达到 1000 人，将在全网免费公开该期节目，否则将继续仅限付费听众收听。该期节目发出后，经过一天半的时间即得到 1000 人次的付费，成功「解锁」并公开发布。
本文即为主播任宁和枪枪在活动结束后，就购买趋势、收听和互动数据、活动执行情况所做的盘点总结，以及在此基础上对内容付费、社交传播等问题的延伸思考。少数派经授权转载。

在最开始写下「迟早公开」计划（那时候还没有这个名字）的想法时，随手给文档取的标题是《请你一起来做个实验》。现在看来，「实验」一词的用法显然是有失偏颇的。实验便意味着在着手实施之前便有明确想要进行检验的假设，然后围绕这些假设来设计实验步骤并依次验证。而回顾「迟早公开」计划，即便我们确实带着假设——「利他考量」也许对付费行为有一定影响——出发，但后续我们并没有（事实上也很难）借此展开一场严格意义上的「实验」，正如某些听众在问卷调查中犀利地指出，「可能是还没想清楚的探索」。
并非是要咬文嚼字，但「探索」与「没想清楚」似乎是自相矛盾的存在。正因为没想清楚，所以才需要腆着脸迈出探索的第一步。作为一次投石问路般的试探，这场计划无论是在机制设计、数据回收以及统计分析方面存在着诸多局限，而我们试图从数据以及文本中总结出的一些趋势和观察也都难算得上是什么黑白分明的「结论」，仅供各位参考。
我们期待这篇文章不仅仅是一次计划的总结，还能够开启更多探索。

今年早些时候 Substack 把 newsletter 带火了。找了找发现中文世界写的人虽然不多，但颇有壮大之势，于是我也试了试。五个月过去了，以「自我探索与成长」的主题写了 20 期，所收获的远超我的想象：认识了一些通过现实世界不可能遇见但志同道合的朋友，养成了阅读写作的习惯，在这个过程中塑造新的自我。
YouTuber Ali Abdaal 在 一个播客 里说，「YouTube 可以改变你的人生，但你需要在接下来的两年中每周发布一个视频。如果你这样做，我保证它会改变你的人生」。我相信写作也是一个道理。
五个月离两年还差很远，但作为一个在线写作新手，我在这几个月的摸索中有一些心得体会，希望分享出来帮助考虑开始但还没有行动的朋友。如果你已经在写了，我希望能借此和你交流学习。
文章比较长，主要分为三个部分。第一部分着重聊一聊写作，解释一下前面提到的「塑造新的自我」，同时回答「写什么」和「怎么写」的问题。第二部分是一些具体的经验、感想和建议，最后是感恩和推荐一些链接。

                    <span>相信很多朋友都是ipad+win平台的组合（得益于苹果优美的价格），而ipad相对较小的屏幕总是不能很好地释放生产力，人眼通过二十多寸的屏幕获得的信息以及整理信息的能力自然比ipad顶到死13寸的屏幕好得多。ipad的便携性不言而喻，但当我们面对接着win电脑的显示器时，又该如何使用MN3呢？

关于虚拟机网上教程很多，这里贴一个 装机教程|Win10下虚拟机VMware安装Mac OS系统 | 莲梦青语   比较贴心的装macos的教程。有几点这个帖子里没提，一个是装上后不能全屏的问题  电脑中VMware虚拟机安装Mac系统无法全屏显示怎么解决－系统城  还有就是网络的问题（这个不同电脑可能不太一样，大家自己百度或Google一下啊）。然后贴一下使用截图

虚拟机使用最大的好处我觉得就是效率高了很多，最大的优点就是和win上面的软件协同，而不用切换系统，就比如我在win上ocr了一本书，我可以直接把文件从win的桌面拖到macos的桌面，再放到mn3里，这样自由度会很高，对于我这样离不开MN3又离不开win（游戏玩家 ）无疑是一种福音。当然，对苹果生态有着极度依赖的还是推荐MacBook，虚拟机很多东西用不了的（例如隔空投送），如果只是用一些例如MN3的软件的话，还是热烈安利啦！

                    <span>大家是否还记得，在那个 iPhone 操作依赖 Home 键的时代，有些朋友为了延长 Home 按键的寿命，特意打开了辅助设置中的 AssistiveTouch 。随着 iPhone 交互与设计的不断进化，带 Home 键的 iPhone 已经逐渐被全面屏 iPhone 所取代。
时至今日，已经很少再见到有人启用 AssistiveTouch 了。除了 AssistiveTouch 之外，辅助功能里还隐藏着这些有趣的小功能，值得大家一试。
降低白点值：让你的屏幕更暗

功能路径：「设置」&gt;「辅助功能」&gt;「显示与文字大小」&gt;「降低白点值」

自 iOS 13 起，苹果为 iOS 系统带来了「深色模式」。开启深色模式之后，系统会将背景色调整为黑色。在夜晚注视屏幕时，一定程度上缓解了视觉上的刺激感，使眼睛更加舒适。
但是我一直都不喜欢这样的深色背景，从来不用深色模式。部分 App 启用夜间模式后，UI 配色经过了重新设计，与正常模式存在些许差异，让我一下变得无法适应。可你哪怕将 iPhone 亮度调至最低，夜晚用起来还是觉得刺眼。
其实还有一个办法，就是在辅助设置里开启「降低白点值」，你可以拉动滑块，在 25%-100% 之间选取你需要的数值。拉低控制中心内的屏幕亮度的同时，打开「降低白点值」，可以使屏幕亮度进一步变暗。

耳机调节：轻松调校你的耳机

功能路径：「设置」&gt;「辅助功能」&gt;「音频/视觉」&gt;「耳机调节」

如果你平常使用的是 Apple 或者 Beats 耳机，通过简单的听感测试，你就可以对耳机平衡音、音域、明亮度进行修改，获得更适合自己的音频设置。该功能可放大微弱的声音，并根据你个人偏好调整某些声音频率，使得声音更加符合你的听感喜好。

经过一段时间的打磨，重构过的 HapiGo 2.0 （https://hapigo.com）终于跟大家见面啦。
作为一款国人开发的启动器，我们一开始就没有想做大而全。而只想把国外启动器缺失很久的中文支持补上，把我们中文用户服务好。所以，2.0 版最大的特色就是全面的（应用、文件、书签）拼音搜索支持，让中文用户畅享英文用户才有的即时搜索。下面列举部分 2.0 优势功能供大家参考。
颜值也是战斗力
我们深入领悟了 Apple 这一精神🐶，2.0 第一要务就是提升界面颜值。提升的主要方面：一、支持 macOS 半透明毛玻璃效果（仅黑、白模式支持）；二、支持多种颜色主题。三、支持原生的 Big Sur 及 Monterey 风格。希望以上努力给各位提供更舒心的使用体验。

拼音支持最好的文件搜索
文件搜索可谓是常被忽略，但实则非常有用的功能。我们花大量的时间做文件管理，最终目标还是为了最快找到文件。如果制定了规范的文件命名规则，创建了结构清晰的文件夹目录，但每次打开文件依然「点点点点点点点点」，那费时费工的文件管理工作可谓白费功夫。其效率远没有使用启动器快速搜索并打开。
目前市面的 macOS 启动器均以 Spotlight 为搜索引擎，这个引擎对中文分词还不是很彻底。这就导致了大部分启动器的拼音文件搜索总是奇奇怪怪。为了提供最流畅的拼音文件搜索，我们重新开发了搜索引擎。

基于我们的新引擎，你可以：

多关键词或（|）且（空格）逻辑搜索
输入 &gt; 仅搜索文件夹
彻底的拼音搜索
文件后缀搜索

搜索到目标文件之后，还不止打开这一个操作选…</span>

本周话题：腾讯的员工退休福利
本周，有一条程序员的大新闻：腾讯正式推出了员工退休福利。

这好像是国内第一家，互联网大厂给退休金。
具体方案是，员工在腾讯就职期间达到法定年龄退休时，可享受三项福利：
（1）定制纪念品；
（2）长期服务感谢金，金额为6个月的固定工资；
（3）退休荣誉金，由员工在&quot;服务年限金&quot;和&quot;50%的未解禁股票期权&quot;两项之中，自由选择其一。
这就是说，你到退休年龄了，腾讯会一次性发一笔钱。所以严格说，这不是退休待遇，因为后面就没了，不是每年都有的年金，跟退休工资是不同的概念。
我觉得，这是一件好事，对于员工来说，多一笔收入。另一方面也显示，公司对员工退休问题是重视的，会给予一定的照顾。
但是，我国的法定退休年龄，男性目前是60岁，可能很快就会调整到65岁。很难想象，程序员可以在腾讯干到这个年龄。我很怀疑，腾讯现在第一线的程序员，有没有达到60岁的，会不会一个都没有。
正当大家以为，腾讯只是画了一个看得见、吃不到的大饼时，它又抛出了第二个更震撼的安排：员工入职满15年，就可选择提前解锁退休福利。

这就是说，退休福利不需要等到60岁，只要在腾讯干满15年，就可以享受。算一下就会知道，如果大学或研究生毕业，第一份工作就入职腾讯，干满15年也不到40岁，这时公司就允许你退休了。
这意味着两件事。
首先，表示腾讯也认可，员工到了40岁左右，如果再待在第一线，…</span>

[动画] 英雄联盟：双城之战

把自己想象成英雄了吗？

@Voyager_1：上上次觉得 CG 动画惊艳是 2005 年的《最终幻想Ⅶ：圣子降临》，我在玩过游戏几年后才看到这部作品，知晓制作年份时当即流露出「无比惊讶」+「难以置信」的表情；上一次被惊艳到是暴雪的《守望先锋》系列，在全片没一句台词的堡垒篇，我在机器和鸟儿的陪伴下观看了一部至今难以忘怀的短片；而这一次，陪伴我大学的游戏《英雄联盟》改编剧集《双城之战》也没有让我失望。
故事建立在祖安这个城市，因为一次炼金炸药爆炸的意外导致祖安分割出了贵族出没的上城「皮尔特沃夫」和黑市横行的下城「祖安」，两个因为二城战争失去父母相依为命的姐妹被养父收留，在祖安生活、长大，逐渐认清世界的弱肉强食，…</span>

近日，Apple 的 iOS 15.2 Beta 增加了「数字遗产」处置的选项，用户可以在生前决定将自己的「数字遗产」展现给谁，他可以在用户身故后继承账户及相关数据。
这个功能重新将我所经历的一段往事提出来，我不禁问自己——如果我去世了，我的「数字遗产」谁来处理，又由谁来继承。

在他因意外去世后的第 2 周，我的朋友圈收到了他的一条动态。
那是一张是他一年前健身时的照片，我当时在下面评论吐槽了；而在这一天，他给自己点了一个「赞」。

那也是他走后我第一次哭。强忍了那么多天，这一瞬间突然觉得「他并没有走」，我哭的停不下来。随后我们共同的朋友打电话给我；想必他们也收到了同样的提醒，都在试图在弄清楚这是怎么回事。
许久后我冷静下来，这应该是他母亲在翻看他过往的朋友圈状态，用点赞表达追忆。但接下来几天，事情变得愈发失控：我不断收到朋友圈类似的提醒，他母亲甚至还回复了他的某条状态。
我理解一位母亲在失去儿子后的痛苦，以及迫切想追忆他的过往。但这个「点赞」的举动，不论是对我、还是对他的朋友，都是一种巨大的打击。不得已之下，后来我通过他亲戚，委婉地转达他母亲：这样做可能会给大家带来更多的伤害。终于，他的朋友圈回归了平静。
但这并不是他的微信在身后第一次被人登录。过世后没几个小时，他的微信朋友圈就发布了一份讣告。一瞬间所有的朋友都被他的突然离世所震惊，众多关心他的人，通过电话、短信、微信联系我，试图弄清楚这事情到底是怎么回事。
原来，他的亲属取下了他的手机卡，通过短信验证码得以登陆微信，发出了讣告。之后很长一段时间，这个微信账号全在他某位亲属掌控下。接下来的日子里，他的朋友圈陆续发布了追思文、…</span>

2018 年 5 月 30 日的宝可梦新作发布会上，任天堂的「第二方」工作室 干儿子 Game Freak 展示了旗下热门 IP「宝可梦」的最新游戏作品：《精灵宝可梦 Let&#x60;s Go! 皮卡丘·伊布》。本作以 1998 年 9 月 12 日在 Game Boy 平台发售的《精灵宝可梦 皮卡丘》——即国内老玩家所熟知的《口袋妖怪 黄》——为蓝本，利用 NS 的机能和特性对画面和玩法进行了全面重制，作为宝可梦 IP 在 NS 上的试水之作显得诚意十足。虽然《精灵宝可梦 Let&#x60;s Go》系列并非宝可梦 IP 的正统续作，但得益于原作的优秀质量，新作在剧情走向和养成系统等核心要素上的完成度相当之高，一经发售立刻受到了玩家和媒体的一致好评，甚至带动 NS 的销量持续走高，为即将结束的宝可梦第七世代画上了圆满的句号。
这可能是玩家初见游戏时发现的第一个彩蛋。
《精灵宝可梦 Let&#x60;s Go! 皮卡丘·伊布》是《精灵宝可梦 皮卡丘》的重制版，而《精灵宝可梦 皮卡丘》又是初代作品《精灵宝可梦 红·绿》的特别版，这么一款跨时空套娃式的作品中自然也少不了设置各种 Game Freak 用来「我致敬我自己」的彩蛋。在游戏刚刚开始的时候，玩家就会在自己的房间里发现一张耿鬼对战尼多利诺的海报，这张海报的内容其实就是《精灵宝可梦 红·绿》的开场一幕，由此可见其地位之崇高。令人意想不到的是，这部开启了宝可梦近三十年辉煌历程的初代作品竟也是任天堂炒过的冷饭，而且这碗饭一炒就炒到了现在。

龙公子找我买剑，五百两黄金要了玄铁定制版，都知道他是要跟张三比武，所以我要了一千。
龙公子富家子弟、成名多年，张三籍籍无名，两个人本无任何交集，但据说因为龙公子调戏女侠被张三辱骂，下不来台，于是有三个月之后的生死决斗。
江湖都知道龙公子拿了我的剑，都说张三败了。
玄铁剑的锋利天下无双，连我也觉得张三败了。
2
店门口来了个买剑人，但是他没有钱。
听说他三个月后与人有生死决斗。
至于他是不是张三，我不感兴趣。
他一定要我卖给他一把剑，于是我让他给我打工三个月。
这三个月里，我一直让他去给龙公子铸剑。
当然他不知道。
这个钱赚的很舒服。
3
剑好了，但那小子今天出门用左脚，所以我告诉他三个月没工钱。只把那把他都磨秃了的锤子给了他。
龙公子拿到剑很开心，又给了我很多钱。
这把剑削铁如泥，举世无双，他必胜无疑。
但他却败了。
据说他败给了一把锤子。
那个锤子跟剑击打的每一下，都打在了软肋上。
好像是天生的克星。

石头城破了，石将军死了。
石将军人如其名，跟茅坑里的石头一样，又臭又硬，刚正不阿，早就成了奸相的眼中钉。
他被弄到石头城的时候，奸相故意拖了军饷，他无奈，甚至把家传的宝剑送到我这里，换了一百把良剑。
我对宝剑的来历很好奇，他对我讲，当年他家遭灭门之灾，父母挡在他的身前，扔了宝剑给他，只来得及对他说了一句话。
“孩子，活下去。”
而那个屠杀他家的人，就是现在的宰相。
所以奸相一直想要他死，
于是他死了。
5
一个身穿破烂军衣的小兵出现在了我的门口。
他是来跟我讨石将军的剑的。
他说城破那晚，也是朝廷的御史来的那晚，有人打开了城门，放进了外面埋伏的异族。
而这个御史是宰相派来的。
我没有给他剑，因为他没有钱。
我只是给他一块饼，问他将军是怎么死的。
那个小兵说石将军最后挡在他的面前，张开双臂，身重数箭。
到死也没有倒下。
6
小兵躲在死尸里活下来了，
他要为所有人报仇。…</span>

本文将通过一个需求场景，介绍一个非常实用的 Flutter 列表滑动知识点，该问题来源于网友的咨询。
如何在 Flutter 上实现一个聊天列表，相信大家都不会觉得有什么困难，不就是一个 ListView ，然后根据类型显示渲染数据吗？这有什么困难的？

理论上确实没什么问题，但是有一个需求场景，却会出现一个无法修复的问题，那就是：聊天列表需要双向插入数据。
双向插入数据会导致 ListView 什么问题？ 举个例子，首先我们使用常见的 ListView 绘制出一个模拟聊天列表，这里使用了 reverse 反转列表满足 UI 需求，让列表从底部开始网上布局滑动：
ListView.builder(
        controller: scroller,
        reverse: true,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          var item &#x3D; data[index];
          if (item.type &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Right&quot;)
            return renderRightItem(item);
          else
            return renderLeftItem(item);
        },
        itemCount: data.length,
      )

运行后效果如下图所示：

首先添加红色的，模拟加载旧数据 list.add ，可以看到上面的数据出现了，没有问题；
接着我们滑动一段距离，没有问题；
接着添加绿色数据，模拟新收到新消息 list.insert，可以看到列表出现了跳动，没有停留在我们之前滑动的位置；
我们继续滑动，模拟新收到新消息，列表继续出现跳动；
有问题没有？如果…</span>

                    <span>因為官方deepl插件太多不方便的地方，因此研究了兩三天搞出了個魔改版本。
目前google版本只有iphone使用時才是最新版本翻譯，ipad版本因為marginnote本身的webview的user agent 設定依然停留在ios13.3 （“Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 13_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148”，iphone 版本的為 “Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 15_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148”） 因此翻譯結果會非常殘破（舊版google翻譯）。希望能用上新版google翻譯的大家就請跟我一起向官方反應這個狀況吧，這個插件是解決不了的。
p.s. 演示用的錄屏不知為何上傳不了，不過我想展開來時兩個按鈕，縮起來時一個按鈕，大家應該不太可能不會用，所以應該沒關係吧？

@南鱼祭酒：阿米洛花旦娘 miya68 静电容键盘 

购买渠道：京东阿米洛旗舰店
入手价格：全价 890 - 店铺优惠 40 &#x3D; 850
下单及签收日期：9 月 18-19 日

这把键盘我主要看中两点：Miya68 配列和阿米洛静电容轴。

Miya68 是我前一阵很关注的一个配列，貌似是阿米洛与 Ducky 合作推出的，键圈的朋友们也常常形象地称之为「田字 68」。它名为 68，会让人误以为是传统 68 键的变种，但我认为它更应该是一个标准 87 键盘然后把 F 区砍掉、把编辑区最右边的两个键砍掉之后得出的一个配列，只需要把 pgup 和 pgdn 两个键改映射成 home 和 end，那么编辑区的键位配置就跟最常见的 87 配列一模一样了。经过长久的摸索，我认为这样的配列可以在满足我这样一个以文字输入为主的用户的基本需求的基础上让键盘面积最小。然而目前来说，田字 68 的键盘，除了一些客制化键盘（买起来很烦，要么蹭车要么海鲜市场），量产厂商里就只有阿米洛、RK 和黑爵有这个配列。黑爵那款不到 200 元，档次太差不考虑；RK 的右 shift 键莫名其妙，右边的三个修饰键也不是等比的 1.25u，再一次莫名其妙；只有阿米洛的 miya68 最端正。哦对还有一点，在我买这把键盘的时候，阿米洛只有 miya68 的接口是 Type-C 的（现已全线更新模具，全线 Type-C 了）。
「田字」 编辑区
至于阿米洛静电容轴，久仰大名。关于静电容，此前我用过国产的宁芝 plum，印象不能说很好…</span>

2015 年 6 月 30 日，Apple 正式推出「Apple Music」音乐流媒体服务。同年 9 月 30 日，Apple Music 在中国大陆地区上线。相比于美国地区个人订阅每月 9.99 美元的价格，中国大陆地区的个人订阅价格为每月 10 人民币，可以说几乎是全球最低。
但对于喜欢听音乐的人而言，国区 Apple Music 虽然价格低廉，但一直给人曲库不全的印象。因此，很多人会选择订阅非国区的服务。这种选择理由是否有事实支撑，随着时间推移是否又有新的变化？此外，Apple Music 在众多国家和地区提供服务，它们之间到底有什么异同，在此之间又如何选择呢？
为此，这篇文章选取了常见的几个外区——美国区、香港区、台湾区、新加坡区、日本区，与中国大陆区的 Apple Music 进行比较，比较维度涉及在曲库数量、功能差异、内容展示、多平台使用、多 Apple ID 使用、订阅付费等多个方面，同时也附带介绍了一些容易被忽略的相关功能，以期让你在选择 Apple Music 地区时能有一个明确的方向。

编注： 本文最初发表于 2020 年 3 月，获得广泛关注和支持，各渠道的阅读量累计超过 16 万次，在 Google 搜索引擎的「Apple Music 选区」等关键词结果页中居于首位。
本版系在原版基础上更新，主要根据近年来 Apple Music 自身和音乐流播行业的变化，进行了仔细的增删调整。主要包括：整体上新增了中国台湾地区的对比；新增了关于 Apple Music 电台、Apple Music TV、Apple Music on Apple News、支持杜比全景声的空间音频、无损音频、声控订阅等新功能的描述；更新了配图、表格；在定价和付款方式中考虑新增的 Apple One 方案等。

                    <span>「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。
前言
以前去旅游时，总是想在短时间内尽可能多去点地方，把日程排得满满当当。
虽然回来的时候精疲力尽，但总觉得自己去了很多的地方，仿佛这趟旅游「不亏」「值得」。 但这样的旅游真的舒服吗？
新疆禾木
以我在新疆的行程为例，在北疆的半个月基本把主要的景点都玩完了，代价则是每天新疆时间入睡（1 点睡），广东时间起床（6 点起），每天超过 4 小时在车上，不停地奔波与景点与景点之间。回来之后，没有看到新疆的银河一直是我念念不忘的小遗憾。
在新疆看到在爬山的羊
而在第二年去内蒙古的时候，决心换一种方式旅游。因为想法出现突然（偶然发现机票很便宜），从有想法到出发的时间也很短暂，我们并没有做攻略，只是购买了机票，预订了呼和浩特中心区的酒店，收拾行囊就直接出发了。要去哪儿、要吃什么都还是在落地当天讨论的。
呼和浩特的街景
到达呼和浩特时，正是晚秋和初冬交际的时节，初雪还没来，日均 2 度的气候伴随着凉风倒挺怡人。有朋友笑话我们：现在大草原黄溜溜的还没有草，雪也没下，你们去内蒙古干啥。但是一旦想去的念头涌起，我们也顾不上那么多啦，只管出发就好。我们只在呼和浩特待了一周，没有去郊外的大草原，只是待在城市里吃吃喝喝，每天在街上闲逛，实打实地在这座城市漫游了一个礼拜。
南湖湿地公园
说了那么多，其实想表达「我曾短暂地驻足于呼和浩特，但没有长时间的与之相处」，作为一篇城市漫游指南，我更多的是游客的身份分享我来这座城市旅行的体验，分享我曾到过、觉得值得一写的事物。但因为不够熟悉，注定了本文并不是对这座城…</span>

极限竞速：地平线 5 / Forza Horizon 5

去墨西哥风情的赛道撒野。

推出日期：2021.11.05
登陆平台：Xbox（智能分发）、PC

微软第一方工作室 Playground Games 开发的开放世界竞速游戏，玩家将驰骋在基于实景打造的墨西哥城市与自然地貌，享受 1.5 倍于上代游戏的超大地图。
本作在画面方面取得了重大进步，引入了全新的动态气象系统，风暴、扬沙等天气不再只是一种游戏全局状态的切换，而是可以直接在场景中被观测到的气象团，按照开发团队的说法，这对于全图海拔跨度大的墨西哥风格地形来说尤其有意义。本作还有个「系列首次引入光线追踪」的噱头，在车辆鉴赏模式「ForzaVista」中，玩家将能欣赏到光线追踪技术加持下的各色爱车。
五代还着重充实了「竞速社交」的内涵：设计了名为「Horizon Arcade」的多人小游戏合集；增加了名为「EventLab」的一套工具，允许玩家构建自定义的赛事、挑战等；…</span>

                    <span>看到了Schwarz空间，tempered distribution，这些名词还是很亲切的。pseudodifferential不了解。粗略浏览过，我认为这个远比Atiyah的证明更像是真的。
我就随便说说我的想法，也许很“民科”。也不完全是我的想法，相关方向有一些文献资料，可以搜索“Beurling zeta function”。如果分析学家问数论学家：整数集在实数集中不过就是一个零测集，那整数为何重要？那么数论学家将如何回应呢？如何在分析学上证明整数的重要性呢？一个可能的答案就是，对于正弦波来说，实数是行波与坐标轴（在某些时刻）的交点，而整数（在相位为零且取波长的一半为单位长度的情况下）是驻波与坐标轴（在任意时刻）的交点，所以整数还是很重要的，它能决定一个波动的峰谷位置是否运动。这件事启发了我们，在研究一类特殊事物的时候，也许我们一开始可以考虑更宽泛的研究对象，接下来去缩小范围，逐渐找到特殊性产生的原因。
我们通常定义的整数可以写成
 
其中  是所谓的狄拉克函数。狄拉克函数在非零点处取0，在0处取无穷大，且狄拉克函数的积分是1. 在实函数的范围内，当然没有这种东西。事实上，狄拉克函数这样的函数，被称为广义函数，也称为分布distribution，可以用泛函分析里的方法给定义。  也是一个分布，通常称为狄拉克梳子Dirac comb.
这个时候，我们可以把黎曼zeta函数
 
写成
 
这种形式。
自然的问题就是，如果把  替换成其他函数或分布，这个积分什么情况下收敛？这种情况下，素数是什么？函数方程、解析延拓、黎曼猜想等一系列关于原版zeta函数的结论在什么样的  下仍然成立？这种广义的整数，以及相应的广义素数，是Beurling首先研究的。
第一个问题的答案就是所谓tempered distribution,也就是Schwartz空间上的连续线性泛函，直观上来说就是某种增长不太快的函数。
第二个问题的答案就是唯一分解定理的分布版本。
第三个问题，函数方程的两边一般会涉及不同的广义zeta函数，在一定条件下两边涉及的zeta函数相同，此时我们就可以得到一个解析延拓。
第四个问题就是黎曼猜想。由于已经由Deligne证明的Weil猜想与此有某些相似性，可以期待其证明过程能启发对黎曼猜想的研究。Alain Connes就长期用他建立的非交换几何做这件事。

                    <span>个人觉得，有无原著关系很大！


先说为什么人气会超《圣斗士》，再说为什么现在很少被提及！


▼《魔神坛斗士》的人气
在战斗武装这个类别，《魔神坛斗士》的人气在当时来说，的确超过了《圣斗士》。但仅限在日本国内。



与《圣斗士》一样，《魔神坛斗士》也是美少年动画的一员。而与《圣斗士》的区别就在于一个有原著，一个没有。


没有原著这意味着什么？


这意味着不会受到原著的版权影响，在创作上的自由度就要高得多得多。


《魔神坛斗士》作为原创动画，在各个方面能够自由展开，满足了当时粉丝的各种需求。所有的创作都是在满足需求的前提下进行，这也就加速了它人气的暴涨。


与《圣斗士》最大的不同点还要说是对粉丝的各种福利


不只是关联玩具的贩卖，与插画师等的福利合影，各声优的CD发表，以及与搞创作的粉丝一起合作的联合杂志等。各种与粉丝的互动也都是促成了人气高涨的原因。



《魔神坛斗士》原本是面向小孩的作品，结果小孩没有太大反应，却受到了大部分年轻女性的追捧，很多腐女都是因为这部动画入坑。


看看现在的很多女性，追捧流量明星是个什么疯狂状态，就可以看作是当时的状态


面向人群虽然偏离了轨道，但是没有原著的束缚，所以可以随时按照当前需求进行创作，所以并没有翻车。


最明显的就是在人物外貌上。毕竟是要符合年轻女性的喜好，所以人物的外貌从最初带有点稚嫩风，变得越来越帅气，型男。















且主角五人的声优还结成了组合『NG5』，这一系列所带来的效益是很可观的。虽然面向小孩的玩具基本卖不出去，但也完全被其他方面给弥补上了。


所以《魔神坛斗士》的人气，就是因为没有原著束缚，随时迎合粉丝需求的高自由度创作的结果。


▼为什么现在很少被提及
没有原著对于此作来说也是一把双刃剑。它在日本的人气，更大程度上可以说是迎合市场需求的造物。


而《圣斗士》不同，作为战斗武装的鼻祖，最初的漫画原著就已经俘获了部分粉丝。而这部分人，就是纯碎的喜欢这个作品。


《圣斗士》的对标人群也没有偏离轨道，喜欢此作的也是男孩居多。粉丝的粘性程度，就绝对大于《魔神坛斗士》的看脸女性粉。



《魔神坛斗士》感觉就像是流量明星，人气爆得快，时代变了，也就无法持续下去了


而引进到国内的时候，我们也早就已经接受了一波圣斗士的漫画，动画的洗礼。而且圣斗士的手办，也都在国内盛行，其所带来的影响是巨大的。


不可否认，我们很大程度也在《圣斗士》的影子下去观看《魔神坛斗士》。因此，后者的影响力就不可能有这么大。


即使在日本有如此人气，但是在国内，没有人来为他打造人气


▼时尚因素
其实在时尚方面，我个人认为也是一个很大的因素。《圣斗士》的圣衣设计，华丽但并没有太失真。



而《魔神坛斗士》不一样，它凸显的是日本武士文化，在造型上就太特殊了。比起圣衣，外观更像机器人。



包括之后的《天空战记》也一样，装备较为夸张。且当时盛行四驱车，天空战记备被加入了四驱车元素，可以把装备当交通工具。






而三者一对比，就能很值观的看出，圣斗士有华丽，但最接地气。而且设计得也最漂亮，这应该也是导致其印象最深的因素之一。



圣斗士不只是人物本身是美少男，穿上圣衣后仍然能保持苗条的曲线，而另两部则就要逊色不是一点了。


不过总的来说，这铠甲三兄弟，对国内的影响都还是蛮大的，而且它们都有一个共同点：


三部作品的歌曲都很nice，至今也如此


象征性的缅怀一段
天龙八部的感觉

                    <span>它是华夏文明的圣地，也是共和国工业建设的重镇，更是不容忘却的、永远永远的神都。

洛阳，一个深入中国人精神的名字。
它曾经是诗、是神话，是无数人心中最美的城市。「玉楼金阙慵归去，且插梅花醉洛阳」（出自宋代朱敦儒《鹧鸪天·西都作》）。
▼

它曾经代表着中国古代史上最惊艳的时光。
威风凛凛的天子驾六、香火袅袅的白马古寺，以及众生拜谒的龙门石窟，无不让人想见当年的熙来攘往。
▼

但它同时也是一座充满悲情的城市。
它是十三朝古都，无数次兵燹、无数次浮沉，令它逐渐沉寂于历史的烟海中，「若问古今兴废事，请君只看洛阳城」。直到新中国成立后，洛阳才重新找到自己的方向。
▼

洛阳！洛阳！对我们而言究竟意味着什么？
如今，当我们从数千年的尺度纵观洛阳的历史，就会发现，它是华夏文明的圣地，也是共和国工业建设的重镇，更是不容忘却的、永远永远的神都。

01 华夏之中
事实上，就地理禀赋而言，洛阳在中国众多古都之中可谓出类拔萃。
从宏观上看，它居于华夏版图的中心，北望太行、南连江淮、东临华北平原、西通关中盆地；
▼

而从微观上看，洛阳更可谓「河山拱戴」，包括崤[xiáo]山、熊耳山、外方山、伏牛山等在内的秦岭山脉，从西方逶迤而来，如同一只张开的巨掌嵌入洛阳西南，海拔高达2000余米。
▼请横屏观看

此外，嵩山立于东部，邙[máng]山卧于北部，如同一道道军事壁垒拱卫着中间的洛阳盆地。
▼

而从山的指缝中，密密麻麻的小溪汩汩而出，汇聚成伊河与洛河，
▼

两河在洛阳盆地冲积出肥沃的土地，然后交汇于邙山之南并注入黄河。
▼请横屏观看

就这样，洛阳居于华夏中心，且河山拱戴、水源充足、土地肥沃。
如此大好河山，只待谁人登临？

02 王都肇始
让我们将目光投向距今5000年前的中国。
此时华夏大地，已经孕育出众多史前文明，它们散布各地，灿若「满天星斗」。
而居于洛阳盆地的先民，则利用居于华夏之…</span>

                    <span>剧本杀，重在剧本不在“杀”


“由兴业路开往复兴路的G100次列车就要发车了。”伴随着熟悉的列车广播由人民日报新媒体中心为致敬建党百年而打造的“复兴大道100号”创意体验馆在北京爆红，与常规的图片、视频展陈形式所不同的是“复兴大道100号”将百年记忆实体化，精心构筑10大场景，打造可感知、可触摸的沉浸式体验，让每个参观者与历史记忆进行互动。

所谓沉浸体验（Flow Experience），也叫沉浸理论（Flow Theory）、沉浸式体验。沉浸体验在积极心理学领域是指：当人们在进行活动时如果完全投入情境当中，注意力专注，并且过滤掉所有不相关的知觉，即进入沉浸状态。沉浸体验是一种正向的、积极的心理体验，它会给个体参与活动时获得很大的愉悦感，从而促使个体反复进行同样的活动而不会厌倦。而说到沉浸式体验就不得不的提到与其密切相关的一个行业——“剧本杀”。
“剧本杀”作为小众圈层的游戏，
圈内人为之沉沦，圈外人雾里看花。一群人坐在一起，聊一个与自己毫无关系的故事，到底有什么不同寻常，让玩家趋之若鹜，沉迷其中？
何为“剧本杀”
“剧本杀”起源于欧美国家一个非常流行的派对游戏LARP（Live Acting Role Playing Game），用剧本虚拟出一场谋杀故事，玩家通过扮演剧本中的角色，根据搜证案发现场的证据和与其他人的沟通交流去探索完整的故事真相，并结合自己的故事背景演绎和推理破解案件过程，找出真凶或隐匿身份。
2013年，一款名为《死穿白》(Death Wears White)的英文剧本传入国内，这可以算是传入我国的第一个谋杀之谜剧本，同时也标志着剧本杀行业的起步——但只限于比较小众的桌游界。
而“剧本杀”真正开始被大众熟知并广受追捧，还要说到一档至今热度都极高的综艺节目——《明星大侦探》。

                    <span>简单来说，历史原因，贫富差距，皮城工业垃圾倾泻等，详细如下。
我们曾经团结一心，现在却变成一盘散沙。

皮尔特沃夫和祖安在英雄联盟宇宙中历史时间并不长，比起恕瑞玛和弗雷尔卓德拥有着远古的历史，上古时代的祖安和皮尔特沃夫仅仅是恕古瑞玛北方的一处贸易站，丝毫不起眼，但也因祸得福，没有过多卷入虚空的危机当中。
随着时代的发展，瓦罗兰大陆的地理位置被逐渐开发，贸易交流也开始大量增加。此时，皮尔特沃夫和祖安海路的便利渐渐显现出来。
在地图中可以清晰，双城的地理位置有多好。执掌着东西海路航道。

双城掌握着东西海路航道，凭借地理优势赚得盆满钵满
皮尔特沃夫坐落在毗邻祖安城区的悬崖之上，俯视着大海，一批批船队穿过它巨大的海湾峡口，满载着来自世界各地的商品。海运贸易带来的财富曾经为城市的成长带来前所未有的推动作用
因此皮尔特沃夫和祖安因为地理位置的靠近和所在环境相似，成了英雄联盟宇宙中唯一的双生城邦，在这个阶段，他们团结一心共同发展，科技水平也是整个瓦罗兰大陆的前列。







可意外发生在，一次的地貌巨变，导致原来同为一体的二者，开始分裂开来。祖安坐落在皮尔特沃夫周边蜿蜒的沟壑与峡谷之下。在进化日中写道，地貌巨变还彻底淹没了祖安的一个城区。
进化日在他的家乡祖安有着另一番意味，他还顺便强调了祖安才是最初的进化之城，远在皮尔特沃夫出名以前就是。在上面，进化日纪念的是日之门的首次开启，它标志着瓦洛兰东西部之间的快捷贸易路线终于打通，同时也标志着贸易税收从涓涓细流变成了滚滚巨浪，注入了皮尔特沃夫城邦金库。而在下面，祖安会在这一天缅怀那些由于地貌巨变而殒命的人们：运河打通了东西两侧的大洋，同时也彻底淹没了祖安的一个城区。
更令祖安无奈的是，工业带来高生产力和经济 ，同时也带来了工业污染。
在皮尔特沃夫和祖安中，毫无节制的工业活动让城中的大小沟壑变成了剧毒的河流，空气变得浑浊。

这大概是关于“双十一”与“空军节”最生动的表述。
正如有人说的，一个国家若没有强大的空军，就像一座徒有四壁而没有屋顶的房子。




1260万平方公里的领空，是一个国家全部的空气空间，也是人民空军守护的疆域。

万米高空，波诡云谲。犯我领空者，请立即离开。


空军又不仅仅只是在飞机上，雪域高原上的雷达站，隐藏密林的地空导弹，指挥方舱内的通信兵，云端死神般的空降兵，甚至空天之上的航天英雄，都是一支大国空军的羽翼。



作为战略军种，人民空军的使命任务涵盖极广，除了国土防空等作战任务。
还包括空投试验核武器，新型飞机试飞，抢险救灾，人工降雨，国际交流合作等。




这是一个志逸云天的军种。
空军蓝，让这支充满科技感、青春感的部队，倍增迷人风采，成为国民心中的蓝天娇子。



双十一，不止是购物节或光棍节，更是人民空军成立72周年的日子，他们才是真正的主角。

临危组建


中国共产党人的空军梦可以追溯到1930年3月16日。国民党一架“柯塞”式侦察机在鄂北迫降被赤卫军俘获。徐向前亲自邀请飞行员龙文光加入工农红军，这架飞机也被改名“列宁”号，这是我们的第一架战机。

1946年3月1日，吉林通化东北民主联军航空学校创建，这是我军第一所航空学校，由于条件十分艰苦，飞机是用马车拉来的，飞行员的安全带是一根麻绳，大部分时候航油得用酒精替代，空中的飞机联络靠的是“抖动翅膀”。
3年多时间，老东北航校为我军培养了126名飞行员，五百多名各类技术人员。



人民空军的正式组建，最直接的动力来自一次灾难。

1949年5月4日，6架国民党军B-24轰炸机，向北平南苑机场投下30枚重磅炸弹，跑道上4架战机被毁，油库里五吨重的储油桶腾空爆炸，吞没了前来救援的消防车。
巨大的爆炸令中央震惊，1949年8月16日，…</span>

                    <span>有希望成为一个多赢的好事，希望大家不要看到征求意见就认为这是相关部门要开始打压剧本杀行业。我认为剧本杀行业确实需要一定的规范，这对于行业发展是有必要的。不过管理规定征求意见的几行字，看得确实让人喜忧参半。
一条一条慢慢说吧。
一.剧本杀——野蛮生长的结束与规范化的开端
自《死穿白》传进中国到 2017 年各个城市开始广泛出现剧本杀店，再到 2020 疫情缓解后剧本杀的井喷式增长。不知不觉剧本杀已经成为了当代年轻人新兴的娱乐方式。但是与电影、KTV 不同，始终没有一个成文的规章制度去规范剧本杀行业。这导致了众多问题：

前段时间闹的沸沸扬扬的「剧本杀《水镜八奇》的设定抄袭《火凤燎原》」，还闹到了湾湾那边，被人指着鼻子骂没法还嘴；
部分剧本杀充斥着 18 禁的内容，却被无良商家毫无底线的给未成年人玩；
大量不懂行的人看剧本杀蛋糕越做越大，无脑加入希望分一杯羹，不仅自己血本无归还影响了一大批新玩家对剧本杀的看法。
......

这些问题看似每个闹的都不大，但如果有人将它们整理到一起，就会发现这已经扭曲了剧本杀在「圈外人」眼中的形象，更严重影响了剧本杀行业的良性发展。前一段时间新华社所发文章《宣扬暴力、灵异变味的「剧本杀」引担忧？》，正是部分人甚至相关部门看法被部分蛀虫扭曲的结果。
如果真的有监管措施或者管理规范可以对这些乱象进行监管并予以纠正，我认为这对剧本杀行业的发展是百利而无一害的。

二.带上镣铐跳出更美丽的舞蹈
佩里曾经用「带着镣铐跳舞」来形容诗人创作诗歌。而事实上，各行各业的发展何尝又不是这样，只有作出了合理的限制，才能更好的促进行业发展。在这里我想提出几点，我认为剧本杀真正需要规范的地方：
经营用地的规范
在 17，18 年，我去过的大部分剧本杀店都是在写字楼高层或居民楼中，一个房间是一个主题，玩本的几个小时里就在某个主题的房间里一盘盘一下午，现在想想那时候还挺开心…</span>

                    <span>前言
每个应用在启动的时候都会初始化一个application类，我们可以在这个类中做一些初始化的操作，例如第三方sdk的初始化，在实施组件化工程后，不同的业务模块也需要在应用启动的时候做一些初始化的操作，这个就涉及到了模块的生命周期问题，在应用启动时候，各个模块可以拿到application，在Application内部的生命周期方法被调用的时候，各个模块也有相应的生命周期方法被调用
初步实现
1.抽取一个IModuleLifeCycle类
代码如下
public interface IModuleLifeCycle {

    int MAX_PRIORITY &#x3D; 12;
    int MIN_PRIORITY &#x3D; 1;
    int DEFAULT_PRIORITY &#x3D; 6;

    void onCreate(Application application);

    void onTerminate();

    /**
     * 返回组件的优先级，优先级范围为[1-12]，12为最高，1为最低，默认优先级是1
     * @return
     */
    int getPriority();

}

2.实现IModuleLifeCycle类
各个模块内新建一个类实现IModuleLifeCycle类，我们把这个当作模块的application类，在这个类可以做一些初始化的操作，还可以获取application对象，做一些初始化全局变量的工作
3.如何管理组件的生命周期
假如现在有moduleA, moduleB, moduleC,然后这三个模块分别对应有ModuleALifeCycle,ModuleBLifeCycle,ModuleCLifeCycle实现了IModuleLifeCycle类，用于实现模块的生命周期，为了实现这三个模块的…</span>

🔥 应用场景
Toast提示默认显示在界面底部，使用Toast.setGravity()将提示显示在中间，如下：
        Toast toast &#x3D; Toast.makeText(this, str, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
        toast.setGravity(Gravity.CENTER, 0, 0);
        toast.show();

运行在在Android 12上无法显示，查看Logcat提示如下：
Toast: setGravity() shouldn&#x27;t be called on text toasts, the values won&#x27;t be used

意思就是：你不能使用toast调用setGravity，调用无效。哎呀，看给牛气的，咱看看源码找找原因

    /**
     * 设置Toast出现在屏幕上的位置。
     *

                    <span>P 图功能与 OpenGL
玩过 P 图软件的朋友一定对这个功能有所了解，P 图我们可以简单地看做把一个区域的像素按照某一方向进行移动，产生一定形变效果，基于这个原理，我们可以手动实现瘦脸、长腿、瘦腰、大眼、丰胸等等一系列效果，从而达到美颜、美型的目的。

我们将一个区域的像素移走以后，那么用什么来填充这个被&quot;掏空&quot;的区域呢？答案是， OpenGL 自带插值功能会使用周围的像素对被&quot;掏空&quot;的区域进行插值填充。
回想下 OpenGL 纹理贴图，将图像贴到相对大的区域，就会产生拉伸的效果，贴到相对更小的区域就会产生挤压的效果，这都是借助于 OpenGL 的双线性插值算法实现。
对纹理贴图不了解的同学可以移步：Android OpenGL ES 系统性学习教程 
所以，当我们选中一块图像区域进行移动时，OpenGL 纹理贴图时会在移动的方向上产生挤压的效果，而反方向便会产生拉伸效果，从而可以实现对人体部位形变效果。
OpenGL 实现 P 图功能
根据上节讨论的原理，我们把选定位图像区域看成一个圆形，圆形之外的区域不进行偏移形变（不受影响），圆内的区域的像素则是越靠近圆心移动位移相对越大。

如上图所示，BC 表示偏移方向和偏移程度的向量，将圆内的所有像素按照向量 BC 的方向进行一定程度的偏移，像素偏移的强度，和像素与圆心的距离相关，越靠近圆心强度越大。

再回想下纹理贴图（纹理映射）那篇文章，我们只是将图像映射到一个网格（2个三角形组成），这是我们只能对整图做形变，无法做到对如脸部等一小块具体的区域做形变。

以此类比，这个时候我们就需要更多的网格，当网格足够密集，就可以覆盖整张图的全部区域，这个时候我们通过调整网格，可以实现对任意区域的形变，从而手动实现瘦脸、长腿、瘦腰、大眼、丰胸等等效果不在话下。
生成更多的网格实际上是为了能控制一小块网格区域图像的形变，也就是一定范围内…</span>

                    <span>从早年的糖果色 iMac，到近来 macOS 系统中的高亮色选项，Mac 一直都是不吝于使用色彩的。但此前，macOS 中一直有一个只认识黑与白的角落，那就是跟我们朝夕相伴的鼠标指针。
不过，在正式发布不久的 macOS Monterey 系统中，Apple 终于增加了自定义鼠标指针颜色的功能。这个功能是以「辅助功能」的名义增加的，换言之，初衷是为了方便视力不佳的用户能更省眼地找到光标。不过，这并不妨碍我们借此机会来给系统多增加一抹色彩。
修改指针颜色的步骤如下：
1. 点击菜单栏左上角的 ，选择「系统偏好设置」，在弹出的设置窗口点击「辅助功能」。

2. 点击左侧窗格中的「显示」，然后在右侧切换到「指针」选项卡。
在窗口下方，可以看到两个色块。它们分别是鼠标的轮廓颜色和填充颜色。
3. 点击色块，会弹出一个取色板。这里，你可以点击吸管形状的按钮，然后从屏幕上选取所需的颜色；也可以点击左数第二个「色彩滑块」标签，然后在下方输入具体的颜色值。
（剧透一下，少数派官方红色是 #C93B34 或 RGB(201,59,52)。）

这样，就可以获得一个活力四射的鼠标指针了。
有了这么喜庆的鼠标颜色，不做点什么庆祝一下吗？

                    <span>因为独居且在家办公的原因，音乐是相比呼朋唤友我更喜欢的让家里「热闹起来」的方式之一，于是在音箱的挑选上我也下了不少功夫，希望能够联动家里四处都能被音乐填满。
这篇文章我本计划是更广义的分享家庭多品牌 Wi-Fi 音箱群组播放的原理、设备和场景，但是撰文之前测试了一番 Android 手机（一加 9 Pro）在目前环境（全屋 Wi-Fi 覆盖；音箱产品除了 HomePod，还有 Sonos 和 B&amp;O）下的使用体验，发现有如下问题：

除了 B&amp;O Stage 因为可以从设置里直接绑定 Spotify 后顺利投放外，尽管可以搜索到 Sonos 的产品，但都无法成功连接并投放；
Android 手机默认的投放协议应该是 Chromecast，目前似乎只有 YouTube Music 能提供最完善的支持，但是因为一些客观限制所以无法成功投放音乐；
国内音乐平台例如 QQ 音乐在软件内置了音乐投放功能，所以可以成功投放除了 HomePod 以外的音箱，但不能群组播放，而 Android 端网易云音乐就没有该功能（或许是我没有找到？）所以无法投放，其它音乐平台尚未测试。

因为我是一个多年的 Apple 全家桶用户，所以对 Android 了解有限，上述问题或许是我操作有误，或许确有其事，希望有经验更丰富的 Android 用户可以踊跃补充，但接下来的内容我将会从全苹果生态用户的视角来撰写，如果你是 Android 用户请酌情决定是否继续阅读。
AirPlay 和隔空播放傻傻分不清楚？

我们经常会在各个品牌的音箱产品介绍中看到诸如「支持 AirPlay 2.0」、「通过 iPhone 或 MacBook 隔空播放」等关于 AirPlay 和隔空播放的描述，其实不必恍惚，它们可以理解为同一个东西，只是再细一点的话可以作如下区分：

这倒不是返璞归真，也不是某种数字理想的破灭。在我刚进入工作的阶段，靠着学习和摸索各种新工具，在工作上确实获得了更快的个人提升，但时间久了，似乎渐渐产生了厌倦，很难再获得和当初一样显著的收益，加上身为创业狗，永远有做不完的事情，对于工具本身的学习变成了奢侈。每次开始新的尝试，一两个月后总会渐渐地回归到最初的状态，留下一地鸡毛。
直到经历多个循环，尝试更理性地回顾，我才渐渐开始思考：那些不容易坚持走下去的路，是否真的适合我？
工具所铺设的道路
我很难长期坚持使用的工具，通常有以下特点。
需悉心维护
很多美好事物的维护成本是天然存在的，这是一个让混乱变成有序的过程。比如搭建一套知识库，创造一个产品，打造一个团队…… 这一点是对于个人坚持和经验的考验。
但并非所有的精力投入都有意义。对于工具，当有更多选择的时候，为了实现相近的目标，我会寻找相对最容易维护的那一个。
我从黑莓开始使用 Evernote，但数年后，当自己意识到只在其中做网页的剪藏，一团乱麻，作为笔记工具，它又让我提不起任何写作欲望时，我离开了它。我的外部信息管理现在使用 Cubox（印象笔记也是我们最初开发 Cubox 的动机之一），工作写作使用 Bear，个人记录用 Day One。
Notion 的出现让人眼前一亮，我曾经尝试用它来处理所有个人待办、表格数据、笔记… 团队也用它做过一段时间协作，但实在是难以坚持：团队中每个人都需要学习如何适应这种高度灵活的空间。当体验到飞书的开箱即用、清晰有序后，我们果断抛弃了 Notion，我自己也重新让 All-in-One 的数据再次返回不同应用中，它们各司其职，反而有种长舒一口气的感觉。
Notion 仍然…</span>

对于需要归档收集的人而言，PDF 无疑是一个绝佳的选择，但有些我们转换或下载的 PDF 可能出现没有目录的情况，这对于快速查找十分的不便。

本文针对影印版文件无效，一个简单的测试方式是打开文件尝试选择/复制，如果不可以选择或复制出来有错字或多余的空格则本文无效

准备
本次使用的工具是 pdf.tocgen，这是一个能够为 PDF 自动生成目录的开源命令行工具集，其由 pdfxmeta、pdftocgen、pdftocio 三个工具组成。

这是来自官网的介绍图，in.pdf 是我们原始没有目录的 pdf 文件，而 out.pdf 是经过工具处理后增加了目录的新文件。
pdf.tocgen 工具集的原理是 PDF 中的「标题」与「正文」的格式一般是不一样的，同样，标题的不同层级格式一般也是不一样的，pdf.tocgen 则提供了一套工具来利用这一差异半自动的生成目录。该工具集有三个软件组成，pdfxmeta 可以利用文字来查找对应的格式信息，pdftocgen 则是利用 pdfxmeta 输出的格式信息生成目录的描述，而 pdftocio 则是利用 pdftocgen 生成的目录描述为我们的原始 pdf 增加目录并输出新的 pdf 文件。当然，这么说过于抽象了一点，本文中我将使用一个真实例子（就发生在昨天，还很热乎）进行演示，相信你看完会发现听起来虽然很麻烦，但是真的上手操作起来既简单又强大灵活，可以覆盖几乎全部的需要目录的场景。

                    <span>Spotify is always working on new features. For years, it has allowed its users to interact with each other inside the app. You can follow others, view their playlists and what they’re listening to, in addition to other information. Surprisingly, a blocking option had been absent from the app across all platforms — until now.

                    <span>看到这篇文章的时候，官方应该已经公布了本次测试的中签结果，幸运的玩家很快就可以正式进入游戏了。
在万代南梦宫台湾的协助下，篝火营地已于近日先行体验了本次 Beta 测试内容，对游戏初期场景「宁姆格服」西南部进行了探索。在正式进入游戏之前，已经按耐不住的玩家可以通过这篇文章来对试玩版内容预览一二，或许也能帮你在限时测试中节约一点时间。

Beta 测试概况
这次的试玩版已经开放了网络联机功能，但由于测试规模较小，我们没能成功「摇」到任何队友或者被他人入侵，唯一能体现出「已联机」的内容是遍布 Boss 门前的留言。
试玩版游戏的所需硬盘空间为 6.88 G。原以为不会有过多内容，但稍加试玩之后发现自己还是草率了：我花了大概 15 小时，还是觉得有很多可疑的场景没能来得及深入探索。排除掉摸索、试验和素材录制等工作需要，完整体验大约需要 10 小时。有攻略的话就更快了，这里单指自行摸索。
在关服前我在游戏中一共遭遇了 10 场带血条的 Boss 战，其中一个是开场的弹反教学 Boss。流程必经的战斗只有一场，其余都属于可跳过环节，绝大多数小 Boss 都位于地下城场景。10 个 Boss 中，有 8 场胜利后显示「FOE VANQUISHED（击败敌人）」，另外两个显示的则是「GREAT FOE VANQUISHED（击败强敌）」—— 一场是刚刚提到的必经剧情战，另一个是此前 20 分钟演示最初出现过的飞龙。

根据官网公告，本次测试持续 4 天，但服务器只在指定时间开放 3 小时，共计 15 小时可供试玩。如果想要在不看任何攻略的情况下彻底探索整个区域，玩满 15 小时差不多已经够完整跑一圈了。不过毕竟不是每个人都能精准预留时间，建议希望完整体验的玩家稍微做出一些规划，避免走弯路。

Beta 测试提供的可用「出身」共有五种，分别是剑士、魔法骑士、预言家、勇者和白狼战鬼，我们分别…</span>

空中利剑——航空兵。航空兵是人民空军的主体部分，可分为歼击航空兵、轰炸航空兵、侦察航空兵、运输航空兵以及预警、电子战、加油等其他专业航空兵。具有高速机动、远程作战和猛烈突击的独立遂行战略战役任务能力，是一支威震敌胆的重要空中力量。

霹雳天兵——空降兵。空降兵是以航空器为运输工具，采用伞降、机降方式投入地面作战的兵种，其编成内有步兵、炮兵、装甲兵等，具有快速机动能力，是用于快速部署和纵深攻击的重要力量，也是信息化条件下我军联合作战、体系作战中的尖刀利刃。

空天盾牌——地面防空兵。地面防空兵是以地空导弹部队为主体，遂行防空反导作战的高技术兵种，主要担负对空防御任务。如今已形成了远中近程、高中低空相结合的作战体系，是我军空天防御的重要力量。

空天鹰眼——雷达兵。雷达兵具有远距探测空中目标和提供实时空中情报的能力，是国家防空预警系统的主体，装备各种预警雷达、引导雷达和其他探测设备，能不间断对空警戒侦察，探测、跟踪和识别空中目标，为人民防空提供空中情报信息。

无形尖兵——电子对抗部队。电子对抗部队是利用电子对抗装备与电子信息系统、设备进行作战的兵种，是夺取战役作战制电磁权的重要力量，由航空电子对抗部队和地面电子对抗部队组成。

纵横天网——信息通信部队。信息通信部队是担负通信、导航、数据链和指控保障任务的兵种，是空军战斗力的重要组成部分。空军信息通信部队随空军成立而诞生，创立不久就担负保障志愿军空军和防空部队入朝作战的通信任务。

                    <span>两不疑第一季完结在即，也借此机会对项目做个简单的总结梳理，在动画创作、制作上跟大家一起交流下。
两不疑动画项目从最早的PV开发也就是最早放出的一分半完整版pv短片，到正剧制作流程开发，正剧制作，上线，每周一集供应，周更一直到第一季完结。前后近两年时间，每个阶段都面临不同的困难和问题，而这两年也是纸飞机动画作为传统3D动画团队从开始接触三渲二到研发自己的三渲二视效建立三渲二制作流程的过程。
回想两年前第一次跟IP方漫漫漫画一起探讨两不疑的动画改编时，第一个面对的问题就是两不疑动画的视效风格是选择3D还是三渲二。
传统3D视效风格纸飞机本身制作流程成熟，在制作和预算控制上更有把握，而三渲二更适合还原漫画画风，可以给观众带来更贴合原著的体验感，但面临在预算有限的情况下还要从头摸索制作方案和视效风格的问题。
当时双方一拍即合，三渲二！不论是画风、故事、角色塑造以优先还原原著为第一位。

两不疑如果要做动画就要给漫画粉丝呈现一个她们期待中的两不疑动画。预算不足的问题通过延长PV开发周期来解决，给制作组一个较长时间来研究和适应新风格，利用其他项目的间歇来解决三渲二技术开发并完成PV制作。
最终1分30秒的PV用了9个月的时间制作完成，通过PV开发制作组熟悉了三渲二的制作方案也对两不疑的画风建立了了解。

随着pv上线，两不疑正剧的前期工作也正式展开，在我个人的经验中长篇动画的创作生产与短片、CG有着本质的区别。一部能达到及格线的长篇动画首先考验的是各个核心主创环节的专业性和配合度，确立分工配合！
由B站的监制老师把控整体方向，IP方漫漫漫画负责整体项目制片，两不疑漫画编辑以及原作者负责剧本原著方向把控，避免人物ooc，提供剧本修改的解决方案，纸飞机负责导演和执行制片及全片制作。
呼，松了口气，终于不用担心我一个直男导演一不小心把两不疑改成少年热血番了。

Ok!原著漫画有好的故事基础，人物塑造到位，又有原作者帮忙把控原著方向，不用担心跑偏。那剩下的就是导演技术型工作了。
如何将原著较为片段化的桥段和情节串联起来，如何把原著的故事讲的更有趣更有悬念，如何让观众更好的代入故事和了解认同角色，是否有原著中被省略或可以扩展的情节能提出来做点小原创发挥玩一下，可以说整个改编的工作更像是导演基础技巧训练。
正剧前期工作推进的同时，针对两不疑剧集的三渲二流程也同步在研发中。与PV短片的制作流程不同，在短片中更关注如何实现三渲二的最终画面效果，角色、场景资产的制作会根据镜头的需要来规划和实现效果。到了剧集首先要解决大规模生产协作和制作成本优化问题，所有制作方案和效果必须建立统一的制作规则和尽量实现全流程的工具化操作。



由于整个项目本身预算不高，为了在有限的预算和档期内尽量达到最佳效果，两不疑项目的整个制作过程中一直在镜头设计、制作方案和最终效果上寻找平衡点。在镜头设计上减少非必要的与故事表达无关的运动镜头，尽量使用固定机位镜头来进行叙事，一些常规的镜头运动采取2D动画的后期运镜方式，把更多的设计精力和预算放在构图把控和镜头节奏剪辑上。

在动画上，项目早期也测试过动作捕捉方案，动作捕捉对剧集动画有着生产速度更快，生产周期更好把控的优势。但写实的动画风格跟两不疑不搭，而两不疑里的文戏、情感戏占比较多，对动画表演的准确度和关键表演细腻程度要求很高，最终为了更好的呈现两不疑的风格还是选择了全片使用传统手key动画。

超过240分钟手工动画带来的问题就是，需要寻找大量外包合作的动画团队和动画师一起协作参与制作。如何控制动画成本？如何让各个团队统一动画表演风格？如何应对参差不齐的动画质量和海量的动画反馈？
解决的关键在layout！
在3Dlayout 环节导演要确定所有创作和角色关键表演信息，避免在大规模制作生产环节进行创作和修改。为了做到这一点两不疑的3Dlayout全部由纸飞机内部的动画师和有多个项目配合经验的合作方完成，在这个阶段进行大量互动沟通和反馈来确定镜头构图及表演创作，同时也参考了传统2D动画的故事板和原画流程，用尽量少的关键帧来确定镜头构图和角色的表演。


虽然关键帧较少，但每个关键帧从角色POSE到表演状态上都达到最终的动画表演级别，用少量关键帧卡准表演的关键节奏点。这样来避免在进入正式的动画的生产环节因设计不确定而产生的大量重复性修改及损耗，也便于控制整个动画中期的质量和统一风格。

以上是两不疑项目中我个人感觉一定有代表性的经验和问题，简单的整理下分享给大家，也欢迎对两不疑和三渲二感兴趣的朋友一起多多交流。

                    <span>东部战区新闻发言人施毅陆军大校表示，11月9日，中国人民解放军东部战区组织兵力在台海方向进行联合战备警巡，进一步检验提升多军兵种联合作战能力。
一、这是对美国会议员鬼鬼祟祟突访台湾的有力回应。
随着台独分裂势力的日益嚣张，未来我们军事演习的规模会越来越大。同时有可能会在演习过程中，伺机转为实战。
在台湾附近海域，进行大规模的导弹发射，甚至将导弹飞越台湾岛。同时在演习期间，有几枚导弹“不小心”地落到了高雄和基隆的外海附近。
1、大规模军事演习的主要目的是不战而屈人之兵。当岛内感受到战争的压力时，大量的民众就会到银行挤兑美元，大量的资本家就会逃离台湾前往美国等地，给台独势力造成巨大压力。96年台海危机，要不是我方出现叛徒，给台方透漏我军打的都是空包弹，增强了台湾的信心，有可能台湾早就投降了。
2、大规模军事演习的第二目的是：在演习过程中，真真假假，假假真真，迅速转变为实战，实现对关键目标的控制。
我兔一定不会打无准备之仗，也一定是主动选择战场，主动选择出手时机，不会被对方牵着鼻子走。比如1950年抗美援朝，1962年打印度，1979年打越南，2012年划定东海防空识别区，2013年南海填岛，2020年收拾香港曱甴。将来台湾问题的解决，必然也是出其不意，以雷霆万钧之势速战速决，快刀斩乱麻，绝不拖泥带水，绝不拖入消耗战。
二、说明我军已做好了随时战斗武统台湾的准备。
美国议员造访台湾的当天我军就做出了回应。我军不动如山，动如雷霆，已经保持高度戒备，在党和人民需要的时候一定能召之即来、来之能战、战之必胜。

                    <span>海拔5200米上，温暖过冬

立冬时节，气温骤降。
此刻，祖国的西部边陲，早已是冰封雪裹、寒气袭人，驻守在雪域高原的边防官兵们，或爬冰卧雪巡逻在边防一线，或迎风冒雪坚守在光荣战位，或傲霜斗雪战斗在训练场上……在这个寒冷的冬天，感动于边防勇士的无惧风雪、牺牲奉献，更牵挂他们的衣食住行、冷暖苦乐。
今天起，“西部战区”微信公众号推出“关注边防官兵过冬系列报道”，让我们一起走上高原、走进边防，看官兵们如何过冬。

海拔5200米
最低气温已达-30℃
虽然寒风刺骨、滴水成冰
但新疆军区某工兵团官兵们
士气昂扬、精神抖擞
因为在这个冬天
他们感受着不一样的温暖





阳光板房内
室内温度已达23℃以上
与屋外形成强烈对比
官兵像在营区一样
开展学习教育
组织课后讨论
对此，大家无不感慨
身处雪域边关
能有这样的训练生活条件
源于党的英明领导
来自祖国和人民的厚爱
不负重托、不辱使命
捍卫每一寸领土
是我们誓死信守的承诺

上午，任务小分队出发了
边关执勤，出行装备很重要
官兵们乘坐自行设计的保温车
向目标地域前进
此时，车内温度保持在10℃左右
身上穿着的“星空迷彩”套装
密封性强，防水耐脏
还具有很强的伪装效果
有效抵挡了高原的严寒天气




更让官兵们欣喜的是
部队陆续装备了
“星空迷彩”防寒作训大衣
战术背心、突击背包、生活背囊
……
温暖御寒、贴近实战
一件件新式单兵装备
助推战斗力“提速换挡”




既能吃饱，更要吃好
中午时分
坐在阳光板房的食堂
官兵们享受着丰盛的午餐
虽在千里之外
热气腾腾的高热量美食端上桌来
当然，更少不了瓜果蔬菜




通过军地密切合作
先进的物流保鲜配送体系
让各类主副食定时送到边防
随着物资供应日益丰富
伙食质量大幅提高
为练兵备战提供了有力保障




一天的训练工作结束
丰富的课余生活开始了
图书室、健身房、娱乐室
……
官兵们在不同功能区域
或学习充电、或强身健体
或放松身心
守防生活不再单调













夜幕降临，冷月繁星
尽管到了一天最冷的时候
但在班排宿舍内
用热水洗漱完毕的官兵们
拿起护肤品涂抹身体
随时可以吸氧
以缓解身体的不适


熄灯哨后，随队军医宫志群
巡诊工作告一段落
宫军医由衷地说
边防保障越来越好
病号也变少了
过冬，我们没问题


边关很冷，保障很暖
今日立冬
祝愿边防的战友们
健康、平安
祝福战友们的亲人
幸福、喜乐



亲爱的战友们
向你们致敬

相信很多 iOS 开发或者 iPhone 用户都收到过下图这封邮件，事实上国内关于“个人隐私安全”的适配风已经在国内各大应用商店刮了一阵，这次苹果也是顺应潮流跟进政策，因为今年 11 月 1 号开始，《个人信息保护法》就正式实施了。

收到邮件的开发们可能会有些云里雾里，实施就实施呗，和我有什么关系？
不过相信随着最近大家 iOS App 的更新，越来越多的应用开始 “适配” 这个规则后，大家应该也能体会到这种大势所趋的画面。

可以看到各大应用厂商都通过了自己的方式来提醒用户，比如：
更新应用后的首页弹出框（微信，交行，平安，B站）等等；
通过通知中心提醒用户协议更新（携程）；
是的，适配其实很简单，就是在应用里增加提醒，告诉用户隐私条款和用户协议有更新，最重要是让他点同意，并且放出新的隐私政策。
更新的内容主要是围绕了几个部分，其中重点的内容可以看微信的指引：
新增加个人信息的导出机制；
收集信息的使用范围和使用方式披露；
广告利用个人信息推送广告和大数据杀熟的规范与处理；
共享信息的规范；

其中 新增加个人信息的导出机制 这个就很有意思了，在《个人信息保护法》生效后，各大平台的 APP 都开始适配和升级，但如果你仔细去看的话，就会注意到一个重点 ：“获取个人信息副本”的权利。
如果你仔细去看大家的更新条款，就会看到很多都有 “获取您的个人信息副本” 的方式，比如一般是在 我的-设置-隐私中心-个人信息下载 类似这样的路径。
借用文章《个保法生效后，各大平台“个人信息副本”的申请获取实践》 里的总结，也就是：
关于获取个人信息的副本的前提，基本表述为：
（1）符合相关法律规定+技术可行；
（2）法律允许；
（3）核实身份+法律法规无相反规定+隐私政策无相反规定；
（4）未在条款中声明前提而是直接告诉用户有权获取副本；

前言
最近写业务的时候遇到一个带有轮播的界面

在交互效果还定稿的时候，大佬同事建议轮播样式可以考虑 MotionLayout 中的 Carousel， 这个组件就是为轮播而生。
学习完发现 MotionLayout 确实好用，用同事的话来说，就是让世界没有难做的动画。
MotionLayout 的思路非常简单，使用 ConstraintLayout 的写法，定义动画开始的一帧和动画结束的一帧（当然我们也可以加入更多帧，在动画的过程中），在事件触发以后，会自动帮我们处理好动画。
不过，本文的重点可不是学习 MotionLayout，而是教大家如何使用 Carousel，可以看一下我写的效果：

另外，官方的效果也是非常炫酷：

并且，滑动的动画非常丝滑，建议自己编写体验。

一、简介
学习 Carousel 之前，我认定你已经有 MotionLayout 的基础了。
如果你连 MotionLayout 是什么都不知道，建议你看一下官方的教程：
《MotionLayout官方教程》
《MotionLayout-代码实验室》
好了，回到重点，Carousel 的中文意思-轮播，它就是轮播的解决方案，可以帮助我们处理比较复杂的轮播动画。
1. 核心概念
我们从官方的例子入手，构建一个如图的轮播：

在 MotionLayout，这些 View 可都是要写出来：

通常一个轮播，都会支持向前滑动和向后滑动这两种动作。如果我们要完整的展示一个 Carousel 动画，至少需要三个状态：
previous
start
next
start 是组件最初的状态，start - previous 代表向前滑动的过程，start - n…</span>

前言
写了一篇基础的性能优化的内容，继续我们的动画相关的介绍。今天的主角是英雄 —— Hero 组件。Hero 组件非常适合从列表、概览页切换到详情页转场动画场合。因为可以将两个页面的组件串起来动画，体验上会觉得整个操作的连贯性非常好。下面是我们这篇要做的一个效果。

Hero 动画过程
Hero 本质是是在不同的路由页面做了一个中转层，然后通过动画完成过渡，下面用4张图是官方演示的过程。
动画开始前，会准备一个空的遮罩层（Overlay）。此时目标路由页面还没生成。

t &#x3D; 0.0，即动画开始时，源页面已经从屏幕消失，遮罩层出现在屏幕上，此时目标路由页面已经构建好，并且在遮罩层下方不可见。但此时 Flutter 渲染引擎已经计算出从遮罩层到目标路由页面的动画路径。

动画过程中，英雄飞起来，逐步飞到目标页面。使用的是Tween方式更改外形和位置，默认是使用 MaterialRectArcTween 对象完成动画。

动画结束：遮罩层消失，只剩下目标路由页面。而源页面恢复到它对应的路由状态（以便返回时使用逆向的动画）。

Hero 基础示例
下面来看我们本篇动画效果的实现。对于 Hero 最简单的应用，就是前后两个路由页面的 Hero 组件使用相同的 tag 标识，然后所有动画都交给 Hero 来完成了 —— 果然是超级英雄，啥都不用我们管！当然，为了用户体验，前后两个页面的组件最好是具有相同的内容（比如图片），然后如果组件树结构是一致的话效果更好。
我们这个示例的第一个页面就是两张小尺寸的图片，这里的关键是 Hero 组件的 tag 标签，两张图片使用了不同的 tag，这是因为同一个页面的多个 Hero 不能共用…</span>

清理「内容农场」，还你清爽的 Google 中文搜索体验

🔋 充电量：283
作者：SHY

少数派开张九年有余，几百作者共同创作，迄今只有不到七万篇文章；而一个内容农场站群所掌握的域名数量可能数以千计，如果把每个页面都打印后连起来，内容农场的内容产出速度很可能会超越光速——但这并未推翻狭义相对论，因为其中不传递任何信息。
阅读全文&gt;

编辑荐语（Clyde）：
虽然 Google 在中文内容搜索这件事情上一直做得不算好，但比起以往搜索结果的「不接地气」，最近几个月搜索结果页面被大量「内容农场」盘踞，Google 的中文搜索也从「不怎么好用」直接变成了「几乎不能用」的状态。
除了作者俏皮的文风，这篇文章应该也是目前在「内容农场」这件事情上内容最为详尽的文章之一了。文中不仅搜罗了众多可以用来清理 Google 中文搜索结果的方法，还通过「小编体」类比以及搜索引擎 SEO 的角度扩展分析了一下内容农场背后的「流量生意」。建议配合 这篇文章 食用。

                    <span>9 月 8 号，当时我的 S10e 服役两年有余，卡顿不多，但已经换过一块电池，开始时常发热，烧烤手掌的柠檬黄色背板似乎提醒我它大限降至。我在数码讨论群组朋友们数十次的怂恿与提前恭喜下，捞离得最近的群友一起去看了正在预售的三星 Galaxy Z Fold3 和 Flip3 5G。上手五分钟离开后，我才发现自己甚至忘了去看看 Fold3 传说中很离谱的屏下摄像头。
第二天，我一个人跑去了三星体验店，用以旧换新权益订了一台 Flip3。9 月 10 日，这台目前为止最畅销的折叠屏手机就到了我的手上。
我在无限的打脸中反复阅读那个群组的置顶消息：

之后，这篇原计划一周体验就写完的文章就搁浅了。删删改改到推翻重来，一周、两周、一个月，我揣着这个紫色的小方块跑了好几个地方，见了很多朋友，拍了不少照片——它作为主力机已经彻底融入了我的生活，我用得心安理得。新 iPhone 发布了，Pixel 6 发布了，刚换新机的同事都开开心心表达喜悦了，我却还在劝自己，这手机买得挺好的，你看你自己不也挺喜欢的吗？
但我总觉得有点憋屈。

我选择了美貌，但代价是什么？
先说说我的需求吧。
我几乎没有「折腾」手机的意愿，这是从换上 Galaxy S10e 开始的。那段时间我的脑子被面前的论文和书本占满，对手机的需求一步步降低，逐渐到了不玩手游、不搞应用、给啥使啥的程度——但坚果 Pro 2 的 660 实在是优化不动了，流畅度开始降到我忍无可忍。在对比纠结许久，四处找真机上手掂量之后，最终在一众选择里挑了 S10e。催促我做出选择的不是性能，而是它娇小的身板，以及国行版本在售的那块柠檬黄的亮骚背板。
当然，三星也没辜负我的期望，S10e 在服役期间几乎满足了我对手机的所有要求，握感上佳的同时性能强劲，鲜有卡顿，One UI 各方各面也都算稳定。使用一年多之后，因为续航衰减太严重，我换了一块电池，心想还…</span>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

通常，如果一个没有接触计算机的新人打算学编程，问我学什么语言，我都会告诉他「学 Python」。Python 很容易学习又非常的强大，对于非专业编程人士而言可谓是最佳选择，对于专业人员而言掌握一门脚本语言也可以很大程度提高编程效率。

该文章的唯一受众是完全不会配置 Python 环境的人，因此一切以简单为第一要义而不会过于考虑最优解。如果你已经有了适合你的 Python 环境那么本文并不适合你，当然，也欢迎你写一篇新的文章（而非在本文下评论，因为这可能会对完全的新人造成困惑）更进一步的分享你的环境搭建方式让大家学习。

选择：Miniconda
对于任何人而言，我都会推荐使用 Miniconda 来安装 Python，对于初级开发者而言，它可以最大限度的降低安装的难度，而对于高级开发者而言则可以很方便的创建多个不同 Python 版本的虚拟环境。
Miniconda 是 Anaconda 的简化版，或者更准确地说，Anaconda 不过是 Miniconda + 一些数据科学需要用到的库而已。相比于 Anaconda 1G+ 的体积，Miniconda 50M 的大小格外友好，因此对于不需要进行科学分析的我们而言使用 Miniconda 才是最优选择。
另外，由于 Miniconda 的诞生是在 Anaconda 之后的、是 Anaconda 决定精简后推出的，因此在网络上你或许搜到的绝大多数问题都是 Anaconda 而非 Miniconda（甚至可能某些在用 Anaconda 的人都不知道 Miniconda 的存在），不过…</span>

我们希望通过最简洁通俗的描述，带领大家了解信息储存设备的基本原理，知道那些复杂的参数，如何挑选购买适合自己的存储设备，又是如何更好地使用，更安全稳定地保存我们的数据，以及未来我们能够用上什么技术。 另本系列虽然与 aigo 联合发起，但所有内容不涉及任何品牌指导或要求的商业营销。

在上一章我带大家从微观的晶体管到宏观的闪存颗粒，让大家详细了解了固态硬盘的原理和结构。那么这一章我们就综合上一章学到的知识来介绍一下我们选购和使用固态硬盘时需要了解到的一些参数，以及如何测试固态硬盘的实际性能和速度，相关的性能参数又代表着什么。
固态硬盘的参数解读
在介绍各个参数之前，我想先推荐一个比较好用的查看硬盘信息（机械硬盘和固态硬盘都可以，比较好用）的软件给大家 —— CrystalDiskInfo，看名字大家都应该能猜到它是和 CrystalDiskMark 同一家出的软件，完美继承了它家软件的特点：界面简单，功能简洁好用，有二次元皮肤。
CrystalDiskInfo 的界面
可以看到无论是固态硬盘还是之前介绍的机械硬盘，它都能读取到比较详细的信息，基本可以覆盖我们下面要介绍到的参数了。
固态硬盘的尺寸
不同于机械硬盘基本上快大一统成 SATA 接口，只有少部分企业级在用一些特殊的接口，固态硬盘在接口方面可谓是群魔乱舞，不同接口对应的协议和最终的速度也是各不相同。不过等到固态硬盘发展到像机械硬盘那么成熟之后，这个现象也会逐渐消失，比如现在 M.2 接口就逐渐成为固态硬盘接口的主流，估计以后能像 Type-C 那样统一固态硬盘领域。
目前固态硬盘的尺寸也像接口那样…</span>

                    <span>针对“台独”分裂活动
东部战区新闻发言人施毅陆军大校表示，11月9日，中国人民解放军东部战区组织兵力在台海方向进行联合战备警巡，进一步检验提升多军兵种联合作战能力。台湾是中国领土一部分，战区部队组织的此次军事行动，是针对有关国家在台湾问题上严重错误言行和“台独”分裂势力活动所采取的，是维护国家主权的必要举措。战区部队时刻保持高度戒备，将采取一切必要措施，坚决回击一切危害中国核心利益、破坏台海和平稳定的挑衅行为，坚决捍卫国家主权和领土完整。

                    <span>话说，这段时间全国降温，暴雪肆虐，不过身处广东的战友们似乎只感到“全国人民都在瞒着广东人过冬天”。
再跟边防的同学一联系，才得知，他们也过的是“暖冬”。
原来，新疆军区大力加强边防建设，部队戍边条件已大大改善。不仅硬件条件得到了极大改善，软件生活配备也越来越好。
一起来看看，初冬时节，驻守在阿尔泰山深处的白哈巴边防连官兵吧。



零下20℃，有的巡逻点距连队30多公里官兵驾驶摩托雪橇进行巡逻



“植物工厂”可满足官兵冬季对新鲜蔬菜的需求

新配发的自热火锅➕采摘的新鲜蔬菜

还是有点冷！
配有暖风装置的摩托雪橇时速达每小时60公里以上过去长途巡逻需要一天的时间现在乘摩托雪橇仅需要4个多小时

完成任务后当然是吃火锅啦

暖！

全文+番外，已完结

车站里，有个男人死了。
我比任何人都清楚这件事情的经过，因为他就倒在我脚边。
他倒下的瞬间，我便实施了急救。
放平四肢，敞开衣领，打开气道，胸外按压。
没有犹豫，这些急救常识我烂熟于心，大脑都来不及反应，已经如同肌肉记忆一般地紧锣密鼓实施。
没错，我是个医生。
从业多年，经验丰富的医生。
胸外按压超过十分钟，他仍然没有恢复脉搏和心跳，列车员迟迟不来，人群中有一个年轻的小伙，自发地拨打了求救电话。
还没有接通，另一只手伸出来，把他的手机拍到了地上。
那人大概四五十岁，穿挺括的西服，戴精致的礼帽，手腕上的金表镶着满天星钻，一眼就能看出价值不菲。
他用近乎冰冷的声音，说道，“三善岛三年只有这么一班往外走的列车，如果让人发现车上有人死了，大家又要等三年了。”
听到那话，我猛地一停。
之前一直在商量如何救这个男人的乘客们，也纷纷沉默了。
打急救电话的年轻小伙，要去捡手机，扭头却发现，一直围观的几个人不知何时，已经站到身后，默默地挡住了他。
他焦急地看向我，“总不能见死不救吧！刘医生，你，你说怎么办啊。”
人群中有一个人开口说道，“人要是能救回来，打电话我是没意见的，可要是救不回来，今天大家就都走不了了……”
“对啊，这车票多难拿啊，要是出不去，人还救不回来就是血本无归了呀。”
“刘医生，你来拿主意吧。”
“刘医生……”
我猛地抬起头，人群投过来的视线像针一样扎在我身上，让我顿感局促不安。
后背浑然湿了一片。
成功人士什么都没有说，只是神情冷漠地对着我露出他的腕表。
敲了敲表盘，示意我注意时间。
还有十五分钟，列车就要出发了。
这趟让我拼了命工作，为了车票抢破头的列车。
只剩该死的十五分钟，就可以出发了！
死寂的车厢，静的连落一根针的声音都能听见。
我推了推眼镜，汗已经从额头流到了下巴。
“抢救无效。”我听到自己用近乎颤抖的声音宣判男人的死亡，“死亡…</span>

                    <span>我国著名传染病专家
原解放军第三〇二医院
专家组组长、主任医师
教授陈菊梅同志
因病医治无效
于2021年11月5日9时20分逝世
享年96岁
根据本人遗愿和家属意见
陈菊梅同志丧事从简
不举行告别仪式
遗体捐赠首都医科大学



今天，我们怀着悲痛的心情
再次走近陈菊梅教授



除了周末
每天清晨陈菊梅都会出门
这条出诊路她整整走了67年
从未停歇
67年行医，91岁高龄时
陈菊梅依旧坚持出诊直到2015年11月，她才退休



47岁：能摘掉肝炎大国帽子
我宁愿摘掉身上更多器官
1958年作为第一批留苏回国的传染病女博士
陈菊梅成为三〇二医院创建者之一
新中国传染病防治的“拓荒人”
那一年她只有32岁



而当时的新中国
传染病学领域很多空白
陈菊梅面临着最严峻的考验
中国被全世界称为“肝炎大国”
每年死亡30到50万人

当时只能查肝功
还查不到病毒
要把病人肝功降到正常
是一个当务之急
转氨酶降低是当时肝功好转唯一指标
可如何降低转氨酶？

从此陈菊梅把自己
泡在中药房里、显微镜下
夜以继日过度劳累
让她患上严重肾炎甚至尿血
可生命在呼救
“肝炎大国”遭世人诟病
研究不能停

可当时如果扁桃体、阑尾、牙齿
这些易发炎部位生病
都会直接导致肾炎加重
为了不耽误研究
陈菊梅对自己下了狠心
摘掉扁桃体、割掉阑尾、拔光牙齿
而那一年满口假牙的陈菊梅只有47岁
她的同事们说“当时我们就特别吃惊
觉得太了不起了”
“她的毅力我们真是佩服透了”



陈菊梅曾说过
“能摘掉肝炎大国帽子我宁愿摘掉身上更多器官”
通过卓绝努力
她运用中药五味子
成功研制出护肝新药
创造了医学奇迹
那一年的陈菊梅48岁


三〇二医院病理诊断和研究中心主任赵景民说
“我们陈教授一生追求的目标
就是一心为了患者
她说我最大的荣誉、最大的快乐
就是能够把病人治好”
然而身处传染病战线犹如天天上战场
2003年中国防疫战线
面对了一场突发战争


78岁：三天三夜不眠不休
写出第一本《非典型肺炎防治手册》


非典突袭，病源不清，病理未明
如何诊断，怎样治疗
陈菊梅主持了北京的第一次专家会诊
“当时她就判断是一种新的病毒感染型的烈性传染病”





那时的陈菊梅三天三夜不眠不休
主持编写了全国第一本
《非典型肺炎防治手册》
当时陈菊梅已是78岁的老人
在人们记忆中陈菊梅永远站在传染病防治和卫生防疫最前线



83岁：83岁算什么
我还是一名战士


2008年四川汶川发生了一场大地震
作为三〇二医院专家组组长
陈菊梅坚持亲自赴灾区实地指导
而当年的陈菊梅已是83岁高龄



当有人问她
“教授，您都83岁了您还到前线去
您不担心自己的身体吗”
陈菊梅和没事一样
还是那么平平常常地说
“83岁算什么，我还是一名战士
只要还有一点力气我就要到第一线去”
到了灾区，有人问她
“老太太你怎么不戴口罩呀”陈菊梅回答
“这里是灾区，它不是疫区没必要戴口罩”


91岁：宁肯倒在临床一线
也不愿意倒在家里


 一生传奇，战功赫赫
陈菊梅91岁时
仍坚持每周五天出诊
“这一生啊，就宁肯倒在临床一线
也不愿意倒在家里
她确实是让我们很感动”



陈菊梅和她的团队一生准确诊断共同攻克60种传染性疾病
她的成果惠及了数十万人
先后领衔研制十余种肝病治疗新药
独创的中西医结合诊疗技术和方法进入传染病诊治《规范》



首创乙型脑炎后遗症患者的“鞘内注射法”
首个发现并应用“五味子降酶”
创造了慢性重型病毒性肝炎死亡率由85%以上降至38%的惊人奇迹
先后获得国家、军队等各类科技奖励
23项发表学术论文140余篇出版传染病学术著作16部
培养造就了一大批创新人才



人如菊淡，品若梅清
96载芳华匆匆
红颜不在，壮心未改
共和国将永远铭记她的功勋
一路走好，陈菊梅教授

前言
在起初的手动埋点的时候，每次版本大更新，很多埋点都要进行修改，删除。这个时候之前嵌在源码里面的一行行埋点代码要进行修改，删除。删了又找，找了又改，很麻烦。如果遇到有代码洁癖的，“产品你竟然要在我代码里加这么多埋点，很影响我代码美观，晓得不！”心里敢想不敢说。于是我就想能不能利用字节码插桩把埋点信息插进去呢...
在去年突发奇想，想利用Gradle插件，Transform+ASM实现字节码插桩，将需要手动埋点的地方通过操作字节码进行埋点。
先是在网上搜索相关无痕埋点框架，搜到不少，都并不符合我的预期，我预期是对源代码不要进行任何的手动操作。而很多框架是利用了注解，需要在埋点的地方标记注解，emmm.....似乎都是这么解决了。
还有一种无痕埋点呢，像didi的无痕埋点，是记录所有View的id。框架太复杂了。。。。望而却步。
就像这样一个埋点，记录新手用户点击领取新用户礼包这样一个事件信息,&quot;new_user_receive_gift&quot; 就这么一个信息。我怎么才能在不修改源代码的情况下，把这个加入到对应的领取按钮触发的方法里面呢。
我起初想到的是用AspectJ，但是对于使用者来说，还是比较麻烦的，有一定的学习成本，如果不使用注解进行aop的话，那操作起来是相当麻烦的。
于是我就放弃了AspectJ,转而了解了一下Transform和ASM,我发现这个可行。
我设想的实际操作流程：
我通过一个配置文件将埋点信息记录。（实际使用）
编写一个接收埋点信息事件的接收类，将接收到的埋点信息通过埋点统计框架上传。（实际使用）
通过Transform执行的时候读取埋点信息。（框架封装）
利用ASM将埋点字节码写入原文件。（框架封装）
使用文件配置进行无痕埋点，在添加埋点的时候，我就可以不手动修改源代码了，只需要在配置文件中增加一个埋点信息就…</span>

前言
列表 ListView 是应用中最为常见得组件，而列表往往也会承载很多元素，当元素多，尤其是那种图片文件比较大的场合，就可能会导致列表卡顿，严重的时候可能导致应用崩溃。本篇来介绍如何优化列表。
优化点1：使用 builder构建列表
当你的列表元素是动态增长的时候（比如上拉加载更多），请不要直接用children 的方式，一直往children 的数组增加组件，那样会很糟糕。
//糟糕的用法
ListView(
  children: [
    item1,
    item2,
    item3,
    ...
  ],
)

//正确的用法
ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) &#x3D;&gt; ListItem(),
  itemCount: itemCount,
)

对于 ListView.builder 是按需构建列表元素，也就是只有那些可见得元素才会调用itemBuilder 构建元素，这样对于大列表而言性能开销自然会小很多。
Creates a scrollable, linear array of widgets that are created on demand.
This constructor is appropriate for list views with a large (or infinite) number of children because the builder is called only for those children that are actually visible.
优化点2：禁用 addAuto…</span>

                    <span>一、背景
最近在了解插件化技术： 把未安装的插件apk 集成到 宿主App中，以取得减少宿主APK包体积等优点。也就是说，一个完整的APK 虽然不经过安装过程，但使用了插件化技术后却可以在宿主中使用其功能。
那么对应的，一个APK的完整安装过程是怎样的呢？用户通常能体验到的安装过程有两种：
在手机厂商的应用市场中 选择目标App自动安装；

先下载APK，然后是安装过程，过程中没有跳转到其他页面，可以说是一键安装。
浏览器、QQ、抖音等 应用里面下载的APK包，点击后用户确认安装：

这种通常是用户下载一个APK文件，然后手动点击，跳转到安装页面，提示这个APK的下载信息等，然后是安装包详情页面，展示 版本号、所需权限 等一些信息，最后是安装中的页面。我使用的是小米手机，对应的Activity信息如下，这其中PermissionInfoActivity是点击“应用权限”的权限详情页面。
com.miui.packageinstaller/com.miui.packageInstaller.NewPackageInstallerActivity: +220ms
com.miui.packageinstaller/com.miui.packageInstaller.NormalInstallReadyActivity: +97ms
com.miui.packageinstaller/com.android.packageinstaller.miui.PermissionInfoActivity: +97ms
com.miui.packageinstaller/com.miui.packageInstaller.InstallProgressActivity: +99ms

发现整个安装过程是执行在小米系统miui的&quot;com.miui.packageinstaller&quot;中，那么可…</span>

背景
VirtualApp（以下简称VA）是一款运行在android系统中的沙盒（或者叫轻量andorid虚拟机）产品。
项目地址：https://github.com/asLody/VirtualApp
VA相关的功能可以通过github介绍来了解，我们本篇主要就VA的实现原理来分析，源码虽然枯燥，却有很多闪光点值得我们学习。
运行机制
首先来看看VA环境下的运作方式（引自网图）：

VA一共会运行在三种进程之中：
宿主进程，即VA自身的主进程，子进程
Client App进程，即在VA中运行的各种App进程
VA Server进程
通过上图可以看到在Client App进程和原生framework services的通讯过程中，添加了新的一层VA Server，通过V+原service的命名方式新增了VAMS，VPMS等VA service，他们仿造了原framework的部分功能，管理Client App各种会话，自身再和原生framework services通讯。
此外我们还能看到，光AM示例，就有原生AM，mirror.AM，VAM三种，暂时只需要知道他们的作用是hook Client App的各种方法，替换方法参数（包名，uid），或引导方法调用到VA Server中。
这里VA Server端所有的service集中由ServiceFetcher提供，Client端通过Provider.call的跨进程方式获取IServiceFetcher的IBinder句柄，再通过其获取其他Service来完成调用。
为什么要设计中间的这层调用呢？我们用Activity举例说明：
看过Activity源码的同学知道，当我们启动一个新的Activity时，它会先经过AMS，AMS会有一些record记录注册，目标进程是否需要创建，启动…</span>

隐私研究所：恶意软件的照妖镜，让隐私窃取行径无处遁形

平台：iOS / iPadOS
关键词：隐私报告、隐私安全

@Vanilla：在 iOS 15 中，Apple 为我们带来了「App 隐私报告」的功能。不过，在「设置」中我们能看到的原始数据非常简单，好在它还提供了一个导出的功能，这就给了第三方 App 发挥的机会。《隐私研究所》就是这么一款趁着东风、应运而生的 App，它可以在离线的情况下直接解析系统的「App 隐私报告」，然后再以直观的图标和时间轴来呈现给大家。
因为涉及到隐私，隐私分析查看工具本身的隐私性更加重要。《隐私研究所》的开发者在 App Store 的页面上承诺不会从此 App 中收集任何数据，它不会上传、同步我们的 App 隐私报告，更不会有第三方 SDK、广告和统计代码的加入。正如我前面提到的，如果你不放心的话，大可以打开飞行模式、断开 Wi-Fi，在离线的情况下使用 App，除了自动补全 App 图标的功能，这不会对解析 App 隐私报告有任何影响。

「你已经是个成熟的笔记本了，应该学会自己整理笔记自己复习了。」 
如果正在读书的你，也曾有过这样的「梦想」，那么 MarginNote 能在很大程度上满足你。
传统的 PDF 阅读器和笔记软件，可以通过下划线、高亮、批注等功能进行重点标记，而 MarginNote 不仅具备它们的阅读和笔记功能，甚至还可以用算法帮你进行巩固复习。
 
高效学习利器
「文档、学习、复习」这三种模式所塑造的学习方式，也正是 MarginNote 能够成为「学习利器」的最佳例证。
这三种模式对应三种备受认可的学习工具： PDF 阅读器、思维导图和抽认卡，但却不是简单地将它们杂糅在一起，而是对应着获取知识的三个步骤：阅读、理解、内化，通过思维导图来加强理解，通过抽认卡来巩固复习，实现文档从资料（Material）到资讯（Infomation）再到知识（Knowledge）的变化。
阅读：用卡片「把书读薄」
通过阅读，将知识分解成一个个重点，是学习的第一步。MarginNote 不仅具备你阅读时所需的摘录、批注、书签等功能，还有「插入/删除 PDF 页面」「裁边/留白」等贴心功能，将正文内容凸显出来，帮你把注意力集中在你想要关注的重点内容上。
使用 MarginNote 的第一步便是导入你需要阅读的文档，它不仅支持 PDF 文档、EPUB 格式电子书，还支持 mp4、mpv、m4v 格式的视频文件，以及 mp3、m4a 等音频文件，甚至支持导入印象笔记和网页。
但随着导入的文档越来越多，对它们进行分类整理，成为了我们保持高效的先决条件之一。MarginNote 为用户提供了两种分类整理文档的工具：文件夹和分类。我们可以通过文件夹的层级，建立一套清晰的分类标准，让每份文件找准自己的位置。

接下来就是利用 MarginNote 的文档阅读模式，通过「文本摘录」「划…</span>

                    <span>Zotero 作为一款开源文献管理工具，受到了很多科研工作者的喜爱，尤其是它能够安装插件以增强软件本身的功能。另一方面，Papership 作为 iOS 及 iPadOS 上目前唯一与之适配的客户端，支持双向同步，综合体验十分出色。
然而，随着 Zotero 的不断更新以及 Papership 的年久失修，它们之间的友谊出现了小小的问题，困扰着很多现有用户。我遍寻网络资源，虽然找到了一些解决方案，但我觉得不够优雅，因此提出一套自己的解决方案，以供有类似需求的读者们参考——
Zotero 和 Papership 之间的问题在哪
在探讨解决方案之前，我们先来聊聊前文提到的问题具体在哪。

原问题讨论：https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/64967/cant-access-webdav-files-from-papership-or-zotero-org

Zotero 本身作为开源工具并不收费，但是免费的文件存储空间只提供 300M 的空间，对于大量阅读 PDF 文献的小伙伴来说，很快就会把这部分的配额给消耗殆尽。如果要进一步购买空间 2G 档位，则需要支付每年 20 美元的费用，对学生党来说有点高。但是好在 Zotero 允许外挂 WebDAV 来存放文件，十分良心，所以不少用户都选择以这种方式同步文献。
而 Papership 则是一个支持 Zotero 的第三方客户端，它可以直接登录 Zotero 账号以获取文献库中所有文献的 metadata 的信息，然后通过 WebDAV 链接直接访问文件，最终实现与 Zotero 的完美联动。
Papership 唯一的额外要求是需要将一个特殊的文本文件 lastsync.txt 放置在 WebDAV 的同步目录内，Papership 在同步文件时会优先检查这个文件，如果发现本地的文件变动时间没…</span>

我是浙江上虞人。
从小我就喜欢去上虞图书馆，那里有越窑青瓷的故事，也有梁祝的美丽传说。不过，后来我长大成人，去了异乡读书，反而不怎么去图书馆了。
大学时，偶然去看了看 上虞图书馆的官网，这才发现虽然是小城的图书馆，但是数字文献却建设得有模有样。他们开设了「特色数据库」栏目，汇集、整理了大量上虞本地的历史资料，无论是他乡的客人，还是家乡的游子，都可以在这里快速了解这座小城的传奇往事。

先说一段趣事儿
也许是几经改版，上虞图书馆数字文献中许多资料曾经不可用。例如，许多 PDF 或者图片链接都提示 404 无法访问的错误。于是我给上虞图书馆的电子邮箱发去过一封邮件，请他们帮忙修正。
邮件一直没有得到答复。原以为没有工作人员专门去看电子邮箱，没想到在我几乎忘记这回事情的时候，我收到了上虞图书馆发来的邮件，表示资源均已得到修复。此时，距离我发去邮件过去了 20 天。
暗自感激，当时我几乎把所有资料全部翻阅了一遍，后来几年里也时不时过去看看，觉得既有趣又受用。后来，我偶然发现一个问题。在《上虞大事纪》的《中华人民共和国》部分写道：

1952 年 2 月，绍兴行政专署撤销，上虞县改属宁波专区；1946 年 9 月 26 日，恢复绍兴专署，上虞县仍属绍兴专区；1968 年 6 月，绍兴专署改为绍兴地区，1983 年 8 月改为绍兴市，上虞为其属县。

在这段绍兴专区的往复历史中，时间发生了错乱。1946 年，叙事上介乎 1952 年和 1968 年之间，显然不合理。况且，彼时新中国尚未成立。
后来我查询了绍兴市人民政府网站《绍兴市志》的内容，…</span>

                    <span>谢邀
我从以下四个方面解答这个问题：

1、香型的由来
2、香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌
3、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：
4、香型如此多，我们怎么选？

一、香型的由来：
酒自诞生开始，就有香味的区别，不同地域、不同技艺，形成了各自的代表酒。但在1979年以前，中国白酒是不分香型，统称为蒸馏酒。
香型正式区分，是1979年在大连召开的全国名优白酒协作会议及第三届全国评酒会上提出的，在第三届大会的时候分别从气味、成分、微生物、酿造工艺等方面综合评价：确认了5类香型：清香、浓香、酱香、米香、其他香型（不属于其他香型的统统归在这）。
随后，经过进一步研究，扩展为12种香型：
清香型、浓香型、酱香型、米香型、兼香型、药香型、凤香型、特香型、芝麻香型、老白干、馥郁香和豉香型。

二、各个香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌。
香型的名称应该反映出本香型产品的个性和内涵，但是香型的划分并不统一：
有的按照香味的浓烈程度来判断：比如浓香型，判断标准是酒体中的窖香突出。
有的根据香味所体现的口感特征来判断：比如酱香型，判断标准酱香、焦香、糊香的复合香气。
还有以产品名称来划分：比如凤香型、老白干香型，特香型。
为了统一标准，要求必须在每个香型后面加入其工艺、风味特征的描述，于是有了下图：

三、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：
为什么中国的白酒香型如此之多？
总的来说分为以下原因：
1、历史原因：
中国多次民族分裂和民族融合，使我国成为多民族文化共存的国家，各民族的地理环境、风俗习惯，饮食习惯的差异，各地人口味千差万别，形成了“食有千种，味有千样”的华夏饮食体系，由此体系衍生出来的白酒，就变成多种香型共存的口感需求。
2、技术发展：
由于生产工艺的创新发展，酿造原料的多样性，各个区域形成了特色、风格不同的各种香型的白酒，加上地理环境的差异性，导致不同区域的酒曲、窖泥、酒醅和地域环境，都对微生物有不同的影响，从而影响到发酵的速度，香味，口感等。
四、面对种类如此多的香型，我们应该怎么选择？
（1）如果你之前没有喝过白酒，但是最近想开始试着接触白酒，那我建议你可以从清香、米香开始，这两个香型，口感比较淡，入口绵顺柔和，舒适度高，刺激性较弱，有利于给初次接触的人，留下一个好印象。
我推荐汾酒和三花两个品牌的中端酒，这样能提升白酒的好感度、趣味性和持续性。
比如这款老白汾15：

（2）如果你已经接触了一段时间白酒了，那我推荐你看看各知名品牌，在这我也推荐几款虽然名气比不上一线，但是酒质和性价比绝对划算的品牌，这几款酒一定可以让你惊艳。
酱香：年份潭酒、金质、丹泉。
https://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/c0015374386b79f17e3795fecfe84c87?BIZ&#x3D;ECOMMERCE
浓香：丰谷、五粮春、泸特、金剑南
https://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/df5d7945012c7e7275e1e56ca47ef7b9?BIZ&#x3D;ECOMMERCE
兼香：口子窖
（3）如果你是老酒鬼，那就看看下面这些公认的性价比高的口粮酒吧。
清香：汾酒、红星、牛栏山。
浓香：双沟圣坊、文君、今世缘（单开、对开）、丰谷酒王10。
https://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/8116e263867e34fc8715090921f95010?BIZ&#x3D;ECOMMERCE
酱香：金质、金酱、武陵少酱、金沙回星。
https://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/4d01d2a2702995759d67b86e17cc24bf?BIZ&#x3D;ECOMMERCE
兼香：白云边15年、口子窖6年。
特香：东方弘韵。
食有千种，味有千样，喝酒重要的不是香型，而是喝酒气氛、讲出来的故事、带动的情绪，饮酒之趣，在于不同时间、不同环境，喝酒体验大相径庭。
如果你觉得文章让你进一步了解白酒的香型，请点个赞再走吧。

Kotlin 1.5  宣布了一个重磅特性 value class，这是一个非常实用的特性，提高代码的可读性同时，还可以提高性能，因为编译器会对它进行更深层次的优化，减少对象的创建。
随着 Kotlin 不断的完善，出现了一系列的特性 inner class 、 data class 、 sealed class 、sealed interface 、inline class 、value class 等等，之前写过几篇文章专门分析 sealed class 和 sealed interface，可以点击下方链接前去查看。

由于我选择了这个相当大胆的标题，为了避免误会，我要对其进行详细的解释。从技术角度来讲，Flutter 的确是一个跨平台的框架。也不止其，所有跨断技术都是非常糟糕的设计。
但是，我有点不同的看法。
从 Flutter 2.0 发布以来，我就察觉到它被炒的有点过了。但不应该再去想创建一个需要部署到所有平台的应用程序，Flutter反而毁了Web和移动开发。
请不要误会，我并不是要否定它，其实我也是 Flutter 的粉丝，亦将一如既往的拥护它。
我在日常工作中经常使用 Flutter 来开发 iOS 和 Android 应用程序。由于早前我是用 Kotlin 或者 Swift 来开发原生的应用，支持多种特性，如：扫描 / 页面识别、pin/biometric 应用程序认证、通知、firebase 统计和一些高级的用户流，现在用 Flutter 来开发应用，我对 Flutter 的优缺点的了解更加透彻。
1、六大平台

通过今年的 Flutter Engage 会议我们可知已经可以使用 Flutter 在 iOS、 Android、 Mac、 Windows、 Linux 和 Web 这六个平台中的任何一个平台上开发应用。这太棒了！但事情远没有这么简单...你的确可以在这 6 个平台上部署你的应用程序，但是说实话，我很少这么做。我很难想象一个人会在不同的平台上部署同一个应用程序，我认为…</span>

有的人想睡觉，但不是因为困倦，而是出于对睡觉的怀念。
——《百年孤独》

2020 年 2月 4 日，黑莓移动（BlackBerry Mobile）在推特上宣布与 TCL 的授权即将到期——这也就意味着，自同年 8 月 31 日起，获得品牌授权的 TCL 通讯将不再拥有设计、制造和出售任何黑莓移动设备的权力，包含品牌授权的现有产品到时也将一并做下架处理。时隔一年，尽管有关于新授权商的消息依然时不时的出现在关注者的视野之中，但可以确定的是：那个为人所熟知的、特立独行的黑莓已然一去不复返了。
黑莓手机来自加拿大的 RIM（Research In Motion）公司，这家科技巨头在加拿大所处的地位就如同诺基亚之于芬兰。1995 年，RIM 的首款黑莓移动设备 BlackBerry 850 正式发售，虽然这款所谓的 PDA 看起来更像是一台带有 QWERTY 键盘的寻呼机，但其核心卖点并非在于全键盘设计，而是在于首次搭载的 Push Mail 电子邮件功能——这种在后来发展为 BES（BlackBerry Enterprise Server）和 BIS（BlackBerry Internet Server）的消息实时同步和推送服务让黑莓 850 具备了随时在线的消息收发能力，一转从单纯的通讯工具成为了名副其实的生产力神器，而黑莓手机的成功也就由此而起。
BlackBerry 850 依然使用 RIM 的 Logo
消息服务是黑莓的灵魂，开通消息服务的黑莓手机会在状态栏中额外显示一组以 BlackBerry Logo 上的「果粒」形式表现的…</span>

睡觉是每一个人与生俱来的技能，但却没人能十分自信地说了解自己的睡眠状况，所以我们需要比较专业的手段来进行睡眠监测。
本文就以从业者的角度出发，和大家聊聊移动端睡眠监测的相关原理、技术和应用。
从医学检测到移动应用
顾名思义，便是通过采集人类在睡眠期间的生理数据来监测分析其睡眠质量的过程。当然，这是我非常朴素的理解，在医学上，睡眠监测其实还是一个不小的研究领域，且普通人并不是研究对象，而是有相关障碍的患者。从为数不多的 百科资料 中我们可以了解到最常见的诊断方法：

多导睡眠图监测（Polysomnography，PSG）又称睡眠多项生理检查，是睡眠医学、睡眠障碍、打鼾、癫痫、睡眠呼吸中止症等相关睡眠疾病当中，最常被安排进行的标准生理诊断方法。多项生理检查顾名思义，需要透过多种仪器的配合，方能进行检查的综合诊断方法。

PSG的检查内容一般包括睡眠情况（脑波图、眼动图、肌电图）、呼吸情况（血氧、胸腹动作、口鼻气流）、心脏情况等，受检者身上会安装多种仪器的侦测电极。目前很多医院也有专门的睡眠中心提供相关检查项目。

需要留宿于医院一个晚上，做为期6-8小时的睡眠记录，而且需要全程配有专业睡眠检查的人员或医生。因此如果对于自己的睡眠有所疑问，可以洽询耳鼻喉科、胸腔内科、精神病学的医生以及睡眠技师（呼吸治疗师）等。

睡眠监测有何用处呢？
医学上的监测手段往往需要对应的专业器具，过程较为复杂，但却为移动设备上的简化版监测提供了理论基础，后者又在一定程度上普及了睡眠监测，降低了的使用者的成本。即便我们不是相关病症的患者，也有了更便捷的方式来…</span>

@柯帕：Google Pixel 5a

到手价格：¥3650
购入渠道：闲鱼

Pixel 毫无疑问是少数派编辑和作者圈子中的明星产品。近日，我不再甘于浏览 克莱德 ， 路中南 ， 三羊 ， 广陵 ，John， 潮玩生活加 等人的图文，购入了一台全新的美版 Google Pixel 5a 把玩。
右上方为的几何「谷狗」壁纸，可以遮住并不显眼的前摄
和往年一样，5a 在两代数字系列发售之间面世，是 平价机型 4a 的升级版，Google 因而在硬件配置上做了一些取舍。
和 5 相比，5a 没有无线充电，没有 90Hz 刷新率，手感（重量和大小）也不如 5，HDR 支持、屏幕硬度、内存方面亦有缩水；但多了耳机接口，多了 600 多毫安的电池，定价则为前者的 2/3。不过由于 Pixel 5a 发售不久，且官方仅在 Google Store 中铺货，闲鱼、亚马逊上的价格甚至与成色尚可的二手 5 代价格相当。当前，若不是看上其更大的电池和耳机孔，5a 并非性价比之选。

到手后，最引人注目的是它被标注为「Mostly Black」的后盖。Google 命名颜色一向比较随意，虽然对 5a 黑中会带点绿有心理预期，但看到实物还是有点意外——这明明就是绿的吗（RGB：47，58，57）！提前买的黑灰色手机壳也极为不搭。
Just Black 其实也不怎么黑，建议改名 Not Black绿色的指纹传感器非常不和谐
其他方面，由于它和 Pixel 4a 和 5 的大部分…</span>

                    <span>Apple’s iPhones are pretty famous for being closed off, with jailbreaking being the only way that most people can imagine for sideloading apps. However, there are other ways to sideload apps onto an iPhone, and the easiest way is through AltStore. AltStore is, as the name implies, an alternative app store for iOS devices. Made

本周话题：新人优惠的风险
很多 App 都有&quot;新人优惠&quot;、&quot;首单优惠&quot;，提供很诱人的条件，吸引新用户。
最近，有一个案件跟&quot;新人优惠&quot;有关，很值得谈一下。

事情是这样的。2019年底，上海杨浦区某商场写字楼搞活动，只要是商场 App 的新用户，都可以获得500积分，抵扣一小时的商场停车费（价值人民币10元）。

结果，写字楼里面120多个白领使用接码平台，反复注册新用户，申领积分抵扣停车费，让商场损失37万多元，最多一辆车抵扣的停车费超过万元。所谓&quot;接码平台&quot;，就是提供各种手机号，代接验证码，每条收取一定的费用。
商场报警以后，警方找到了那120多位白领，不仅要他们补交停车费，还将其中金额较大的20多人以诈骗罪起诉，目前已有两人获刑。
所以，大家知道了吧，滥用&quot;新人优惠&quot;可能会触犯法律，构成诈骗罪。
但是，我对这个案件有些不一样的看法。我觉得，白领贪图小便宜固然不对，但是商场应该负大部分责任，它的损失很大程度上是自己造成的。
商场设计这个活动时，就应该预料到，有人会用多个手机号，多次注册新用户领取优惠。但是，它没有设计任何预防措施，其实只要规定一个车牌号只能享受一次优惠，就能完全避免损失。等到事情真的发生了，它也没有第一时间终止活动，而是听任损失不断扩大。
所以，商场自己的疏忽和消极应对，我觉得才是这件事的主要原因。只要设计活动方案时，稍微周全一点，就能避免这个漏洞，不会去考验人性了。法官如果判决，商场必须自己承担大部分损失，也是完全说得通的，而且还能警示其他 App。

                    <span>用我们的视角定义「逃离」
2019 年的时候，我听到了一期 GQ Talk 与蒋方舟的谈话，主题是《蒋方舟：我为什么要主动脱离社交网络？ 》，这一期中，她详细展开了自己进行的一场互联网脱退实验，她开始用钢笔写作，不再互联网上冲浪，基本上不关注任何的热点事件，跟人的微信沟通基本上保持在最小和最基本的频率里，另外，她也讲述了自己进行这场实验的动机和方式。
老神棍 Durov 在前段时间谈到被高估的 7 件事情时也提到社交网络，他是这样说的：

The incessant flow of junk cluttering our minds from social media decreases our happiness and creativity.

对于这个，相信不少人都有着同样的感受。

Disconnecting from these internet services is the best thing we can do on any given day.

尽管事实如此，但他给出的建议则看起来很极端。我们无法做到完全切断网络，也不能全盘否认社交网络带来的一些便利，比如让异地的两个人跨越地域的限制，可以随时交流。
此处我们定义的「逃离」，也只是找到一个线上社交的平衡，用自己的方式摆脱被社交网络绑架的状态，将在网络上的交流和沟通减小到能承受的最小值。
宇宙浪费指南：专注力被剥夺，尝试用另一种形式表达和记录
「逃离」一个让我失去耐心的状态
其实在我刚听到那期播客的时候，对她说的话虽然表示认同，但却并没有感触很深，一是因为彼时正处在人生低谷期，心理状态不好，需要能分散注意力的东西，社交网络对那时的我来说像是一根救命稻草。二是以前也没有像现在一样强烈地感受到「互联网上话语圈的撕裂」，就像她提到的一样，大家在网上对于不喜欢的东西接受度变得越来越低，我也愈发感受到了「不认可就批…</span>

《瞎玩菌的游戏周报》是我对游戏领域的观察和点评。具有以下特点：

宁缺毋滥，为读者带来价值
主观，但基于事实和数据
有新鲜感，但时效性不强
享受游戏，但反对沉迷游戏
提升品位，但反对鄙视链

享乐
「享乐（yuè ）」版块是为了推荐好的游戏音乐，「享」字体现「分享」音乐和「享受」音乐两重意思。我衷心希望也许有人因为音乐从而对游戏产生兴趣（我就是），也欢迎读者评论推荐你们喜欢的游戏音乐，我将会在后续的游戏周报中分享。

                    <span>如果你经常需要在 Obsidian 中处理文字，尤其是进行中文输入时，也许会遇到这些难处：

长段中文内容在行尾的排版上总是参差不齐长短突出，无法整齐排列。
需要频繁地在中文和英文、数字内容之间手动输入空格，无法像在 iPhone 上输入时一样自动进行排版规范。
想双击选中某个具体的中文词语方便修改，却只能固定选中逗句之间的一整段。
想输入一对成对符号如「」《》，每次都要完整地把两边的符号打一遍。
想统计某一段文本内容的具体字数，可即使拖拽选中也只会显示整个文档的总字数。
……

是的，原装的 Obsidian 对中文内容的输入支持就是这么差劲，如果不手动进行调整，你的体验要多变扭有多变扭。
自入坑 Obsidian 以来的几个月，我一直在努力创造一个更方便中文写作的环境，经过长时间的尝试找到了不少好用的插件和代码片段。在它们的帮助下，你的 Obsidian 中文输入体验将得到得到质的飞越。还有一些插件虽然不与中文输入直接相关，但能为「码字」这件事带来许多角角落落的细节体验提升，比如「所见即所得」，结构醒目清晰的文件夹侧边栏，保护你的内容隐私等等。本文中，我就为大家介绍这些我发现的优质资源。
注意：以下推荐的插件，大部分在 Obsidian 插件市场中搜索名称即可找到，但也存在部分插件在社区中还没有上线，一些代码片段不好找。不过没事，所有的内容我都提供了下载链接。
解决中文长文输入痛点的插件
更好的中文分词：Word Splitting for Simplified Chinese in Edit Mode
Obsidian 默认并不支持中文分词，双击文本往往会选中标点符号之间的一长串。安装这个插件后，编辑模式下的双击会自动选中句中的一个具体词语。

                    <span>The Apple ID website had looked the same for the past few years. Fortunately, Apple has finally given it an overdue facelift that completely replaces the old interface. In the past, visitors were greeted by a sign in/up screen that showed random people using different Apple devices. Now it has a more modern look that

2019年九月去了一趟三亚，由于不是第一次去，又特别怕晒嫌热，跟男盆友两个人都是学建筑的，便发明了一种新的玩法：逛酒店，五天一口气逛了八个。最近忽然觉得应该记录下来，稍作整理，以便自己以后借鉴。当然如果也能把这些信息分享给更多需要的人，这次旅途就更有意义了。
八个酒店中，两个分布在亚龙湾（含太阳湾），其余六个均位于海棠湾。其中，亚龙湾海水平缓沙滩细腻更适合亲近，而海棠湾风浪较大不适下水，这个特点也决定了不同湾区酒店对于海水利用的侧重不同：休闲娱乐还是欣赏景观。

接下来一一介绍八个酒店：
1.三亚太阳湾柏悦酒店——无处不在的轴线
三亚柏悦所处的位置就藏于亚龙湾龙首之地_——太阳湾。三面环山，一面揽海， “藏风聚气”。拥有5公里山海公路，沿路花树层叠，享尽壮美海天。
建筑设计：Jean-Michel Gathy（跟嘉佩乐的设计师是一个人，怪不得都做得那么好）
整个酒店是后现代与中式风的跨界结合，六栋独立大楼分散式布局，依山就势，为了让客人能更好的享受到缓和舒适的山林空气，大楼底部采用拱门设计，这样可以更好的调节了山脉与大海间的气流。


乍一看太阳湾柏悦是外观立面上最显低调的酒店了。但行走其间会发现无处不在的轴线纵横交织，共同构成了最具序列感和纵深感的酒店集群。



2.三亚亚龙湾希尔顿大酒店——别具一格的东南亚风味
是希尔顿国际在中国的第一家全球度假村。茅草屋顶的亭阁、蛙声四起的池塘、辽阔自然的梯田等等，都在园景中错落有致。园景之中，水林相间，热带的景观植物将南方的特色细致地描绘出来，为客人提供了独一无二的度假体…</span>

                    <span>近来整理外公的笔记本，记叙心得，与诸君分享。
外公自退休后入股市，二十多年来周一至周五上午九点到下午三点工作，晚上再耕耘三两钟头，笔记主要记录整理新闻资料、分析行情走势数据。早年间，他多是做剪报，后因家中失火心血化为灰烬。近十余年间，他的笔记又渐渐积累了数十本，自成体系。本文简单梳理其笔记系统，并做简要讨论，以做纪念。
基本体例
外公的笔记系统非常简单，一言蔽之，按专题分块分区，以时间为线索依次排列，利用活页本灵活调整结构。
材质选用
他的笔记少量存于电脑，主体部分是纸笔笔记。近年来，笔记本统一为 A5 活页本，封面花色和纸质没有什么特殊的选择。笔分三色，黑色水笔、红色水笔、铅笔。黑色部分记录主体内容，红色标注重点信息或用于增补内容，铅笔记录不确定的内容。

目录
笔记本以板块进行区分，每一个专题对应一本专用笔记本。单个专题用完一本（即厚度最大无法再加纸）后接续第二本。透明封面的笔记本通常不另贴标签，不透明封面的笔记本封面处会贴标签注明，同一专题若干本笔记以一二三顺序标注。
每本笔记第一页是目录，目录内容会随正文内容增加而不断增补，或定期更新版本。一级目录以天干排序，二级目录以一二三四排序，未见三级目录。更新目录版本即新誊抄一份夹进活页本中作为首页，旧版即可丢弃。

笔记内容主要包括两个方面，一是行业产业信息，二是自选股信息。从笔记使用目的来看，外公记笔记目的明确，以选股为最终目的，因此有选股意愿的专题会增加自选股信息专栏，配以相应的自选股小目录（如下图所示）。

记录方式
无论是产业行业信息还是自选股信息，笔记均以时间为线索录入信息。如下图所示，每当看到新材料便记录到相应专题页下，首先记录日期，随后记录具体内容。有些信息时间跨度会非常大，如下图中所示，关于钠电池的第一条记录记于 2013 年 4 月，第二条记于 2016 年 7 月，第三条则记于 2020 年 2 月。（…</span>

@张奕源 Nick：Bellroy Lite Duffel 轻行行李包
上周五出差之前，我正在犹豫两天的短差用什么包合适，就神奇地收到了来自同事赠送的 Bellroy Lite Duffel 轻行行李包。因为送的时机正好，所以我也没客气，直接就笑纳了。
同事送我的 Bellroy Lite Duffel 是白色版，Bellroy 网站上还有一个同款的黑色。但我建议，如果你要购买这款包包——除非你真的非常非常喜欢黑色——一定要购买白色版，因为它太好看了。白色版 Bellroy Lite Duffel 的实际颜色带一点灰，搭配细腻的网格设计，将包包的质感体现得很明确。从上海出差回来后，我继续把这款包作为日常通勤使用，回到办公室后就听到好几位同事表达「哎你这包真好看」的赞叹。
借用一张 Bellroy 的外观图，好看
Bellroy Lite Duffel 轻行行李包的定位是都市通勤和短期差旅，所以功能上的最大特点就是「能装」。我这次的两天之旅是参加 JustPod 举办的 PodFest 播客大会，原本我自己去就行，但黛西此前还没去过上海，于是一路同去。单人之行变成了双人，要带的衣物也增加了一倍。但对 Bellroy Lite Duffel 来说，这样的负载增量完全不是问题。
除了两个人的秋季衣物和一个化妆包之外，我还装了两部相机，而且其中一部带着完整包装盒（因为要借道还给朋友）。此外，作为科技爱好者，各种电子书、充电宝、电源线、充电头等数码配件也要统统塞进包内，即使这么一通装，Bellroy L…</span>

                    <span>引言
随着搭载 M1 Pro 和 M1 Max 芯片的新款 MacBook Pro 上市，Apple 历史上的第二次平台迁移已经打下了扎实的基础；M1 系列芯片的优秀表现，也让用户在选购时无需在其与 Intel 平台旧款间纠结。
然而，如果说 M1 系列 Mac 机型目前还有什么制约用户、特别是办公用户选购的因素，那就是缺少运行 Windows 的完善方案。在过去，Mac 用户运行 Windows 的选择很多：既可以使用 Apple 官方支持的 BootCamp 安装双系统，也可以使用虚拟机。由于当时与主流 PC 同属 X86 架构，虚拟机工具选择也很多样，从付费的 Parallels Desktop 和 VMware Fusion，到免费的 VirtualBox、QEMU 都可堪此任。

回到当下，BootCamp 已经被 Apple 抛弃，而虚拟机方案也因架构的鸿沟而进展迟缓。截至目前，只有新近发布的 Parallels Desktop 17 宣布支持 Windows 11 ARM64 版。这固然是利好消息，但不少用户可能对其较高的售价感到顾虑（每年 498 元，双十一期间折扣至 349 元；利益声明：通过前述链接购买，少数派将获得佣金）。
那么，是否有在 M1 系列 Mac 上虚拟 Windows 11 的免费方案，它们的表现是否能满足日常使用的需求呢？这就是本文要回答的问题。
请注意：

本文适用于使用 M1、M1 Pro 或 M1 Max 芯片的 Mac 机型。对于使用 Intel 处理器的机型，一般建议直接使用免费且完善的 VMware Fusion Player 即可。本文亦不介绍使用 Parallels Desktop 17 安装 Windows 11 的步骤，因为该操作有完整的官方文档，且属于开发商技术支持范围。
本文所述运行情况及方法步骤仅适用于写作时（…</span>

                    <span>2013 年 5 月 14 日，美国知名演员安吉丽娜·朱莉（Angelina Jolie）在《纽约时报》上发表《我的医疗决定（My Medical Choice）》一文，向外界披露了自己在早前的基因检测中得知，自己的基因组中携带了会大幅提高乳腺癌和卵巢癌患病率的缺陷基因—— BRCA1 基因，并于 2 月 2 日至 4 月 20 日期间接受一系列的治疗，让自己未来患上乳腺癌的几率从 87% 下降至不足 5%。手术成功后，朱莉继续活跃在影坛，为观众们奉上了许多优秀的作品。
图为安吉丽娜·朱莉在手术 5 年后出演的电影《沉睡魔咒 2》海报
根据世界卫生组织国际癌症研究机构（IARC）于本年初发布的 2020 年全球最新癌症负担数据，2020 年全球新发癌症病例共 1929 万例，其中乳腺癌以全球约 226 万的发病总人数，超过肺癌（全球发病人数 220 万）成为 2020 年的全球第一大癌症；因患乳腺癌而死亡的病例则有 68 万例，位居癌症死亡人数第五。
目前临床有一系列用于评估乳腺癌患癌风险的因素，其中能很大程度上帮助评估早期患癌风险乃至辅助临床确诊的，就有通过 NGS（即 Next Generation Sequencing，又名High-Throughput Sequencing，高通量测序）测定乳腺癌基因突变这一项。
注：有相关顾虑的读者可以借助 乳腺癌风险评估工具 进行自我评估。
安吉丽娜·朱莉所接受的用于筛查乳腺癌基因的高通量测序，本质上就是一种基因检测技术，属于「医疗级的基因检测」，和我们平时在微信小程序、网商平台所见到的「消费级的基因检测」，是同一种技术在不同领域的运用。
既然基因检测这么「神」的话，我们是否也可以通过寄一管唾液到检测机构，就查出来以后会患什么癌症并加以防范，或是给孩子做一次检测，就知道孩子有什么天赋从而以后着重从哪些方面去培养孩子呢？

最近某款笔记应用转到订阅制的新闻引起了很多人的关注。很多人表示想要迁移到别的笔记应用去。在这些讨论中我看到有人提到了 Notes Plus （后略称为 NP），这让我有些意外。在 iPad 上出现过很多优秀的笔记软件，在提到它们的时候，GoodNotes 和 Notability 是最常作为标杆被拿来做比对的，而 Notes Plus 则很少被提起。
NP 是一款买断制的应用，这 10 年来一直没有停止更新和适配，也没有推出过大版本更新重新购买。我都不知道开发者在靠什么吃饭。所以当我发现它推出了 10 周年新版本（Notes Plus X，后略称为 NPX）的时候，确实感到了一些惊喜。
NP 有一些很实用的功能。比如你可以画一个圈，然后可以选择让这个圈变成一个规则圆形。如果你的圈里面有你书写过的内容，这个圈还可以用来「选中」已写内容，然后对它进行进一步操作（比如移动/删除或者转换为文字）。当然，在你想要选中内容的时候，你并不需要真的画一个圈。只要画一个封闭的形状都可以完成选中操作。虽然自动绘制图形和选中书写内容都不是独家的功能，这一套操作流程是我目前用过的笔记应用中最便捷的设计。
关于 Notes Plus 的更多功能和特性，在少数派已经有 一篇文章 详细地介绍过，我就不再赘述。这里我只想在那篇文章的基础之上做一些补充，介绍一下 NPX 具体有哪些变化。
模板
首先说一个旧文中没有提到的功能，即笔记本的模板。NP 提供了相当丰富的模板类型，从普通的横线个/网格，到日历，甚至到乐谱，应该可以满足大部分人的使用需求了。在此之上，NP …</span>

                    <span>Windows 11 已经在 10 月初发布了正式版，相比 Windows 10 ，Windows 11 中我个人最看重的或许就是 Windows Subsystem for Android™️ 的支持，但微软却对现有 Windows 10 电脑升级至 Windows 11 采取了诸多的限制，对于不符合硬件要求的 Windows 10 电脑，想要升级到 Windows 11 可谓是困难重重。
目前微软给出了以下三种方式来让当前运行 Windows 10 的电脑升级到 Windows 11：

通过 Windows Update 更新来升级
通过 Windows 11 镜像升级
通过创建 Windows 11 媒体工具升级

但对于不满足 Windows 11 硬件要求的电脑，第一种方法无法绕过，而第二以及第三种办法，会在安装程序中的硬件检测这个步骤时弹出以下检测结果并让安装升级过程终止。

因此我们需要通过一些第三方的办法来绕过硬件检测，从而可以将不符合 Windows 11 硬件要求的 Windows 10 电脑强行升级到 Windows 11。
由开发者 AveYo 开发这款名为 MediaCreationTool.bat 脚本工具是一款非常实用的 Windows 10/11 系统部署脚本，相比官方的媒体创建工具繁琐的检测操作，这款 Windows 媒体创建工具可以说是「一键式」操作，更重要的是对于不符合 Windows 11 硬件要求的电脑，可以自动创建跳过检测的步骤以及脚本，从而将 Windows 10 电脑强行升级到 Windows 11 中。

首先我们需要准备一个存储空间大于 8GB 的 U 盘，格式化并插入到准备安装 Windows 11 的电脑中，然后我们点击 这里下载 MediaCreationTool.bat 脚本工具，点击右键选择「使用管理员身份运行」。

之后在弹出的 MCT 版本选择器中点击「11」来选择 Windows 11 的媒体创建工具。

然后再选择「Make USB」来创建经过处理的 Windows 11 安装 U 盘。当然如果你想要直接不创建 U 盘来直接升级，也可以选择「Auto Upgrade」。

选择完成之后，脚本自动下载 Windows 11 媒体创建工具并开始下载 Windows 11 安装镜像，这里和我们一般下载运行 Windows 11 媒体创建工具步骤基本类似。
安装镜像下载完成之后，脚本会根据当前电脑的硬件情况开始处理下载的镜像。然后再将处理好的镜像写入到 U 盘中，同时生成安装脚本。

打开创建好的安装 U 盘，你就会发现里面多出来 auto.cmd 这个执行脚本，而这个脚本将会在安装过程中帮助你跳过硬件检测。而如果想要升级到 Windows 11，就可以直接使用管理员权限来这个脚本，后面的升级完全自动化，之后你就可以将这个不符合 Windows 11 硬件要求的 Windows 10电脑，保留数据升级到 Windows 11 了。

最后，趁着升级到的这段时间一起来看看 Windows 11 都有哪些新特性吧。

                    <span>前言：选择品牌就是选择系统
虽然打开这篇文章的读者应该都是索尼的用户了，但是我还是想啰嗦一下在选择相机品牌时的一些心得。在厂商的宣传中，我们很容易地把大部分注意力放到相机的机身上。因为机身是一个厂商设计风格和科技水平的凝聚。
对摄影圈有所了解的人都会对一些厂商的「固有印象」十分熟悉：
尼康适合拍风景，机身设计比较硬朗，传感器宽容度出色；
佳能直出画面对肤色很友好，对焦很快，机身设计弧度比较圆润；
富士的机身外观很复古，有很好用的胶片模拟滤镜；
……
这些对机身参数和外观设计的理解会帮助我们更快地区分不同品牌。不过，当我们真正要入坑什么品牌的时候，我们购入的不仅仅是这个品牌的机身，还包括它的镜头以及各种配件，也就是说，我们最终购入的是一个系统。
除了要考虑机身的性能，价格，外观，针对每个人自己的使用环境，我们还需要考虑：

镜头的镜头群丰富程度（特别是新系统，如尼康的Z系统，佳能的 RF 系统）
镜头价格（如佳能 RF 系统的镜头，有的镜头零售价比官方指导价还要高几千块）
镜头马达（优秀的步进马达可以更好地实现柔顺的追焦效果和安静的追焦）
镜头的口径（方便滤镜系统共用）
机身数据的存储方式（XQD 卡读写速度快，但是价格昂贵）

总之，尽可能通盘考虑可以为你最终的决策提供足够多的信息，避免发生「灭门惨案」。
读懂镜片的名字：ASPH, APO, ED, SLD...
在我们看镜头的镜头的剖面图时，往往会看到白色的镜片中，会有几枚彩色的镜片，加上一些看起来不明觉厉的英文。

第一次看到这些陌生的名词，我的心情比较复杂。因为哪怕加上中文解释，我也不知道这几枚特殊的镜片究竟起到什么作用。

今天我顺便来给大家梳理一下比较常见的特殊镜片对应的含义。
ASPH 非球面镜片：非球面镜片的表面弧度与普通球面镜片不同，过去采用球面设计会使像差和变形增大，出现明显的影像不清，视界歪曲、视野狭小…</span>

                    <span>在搞定了 Windows 和 Android 的协同以及 macOS 和 Android 协同之后，我将目光转向了 Windows 和 iOS 之间的协同解决方案。
关联阅读：通知推送、文件互传…… 免费好用的桌面 / 移动端协同工具：KDE Connect
和我之前固有印象有所出入的是，虽然微软在推出《你的手机》伊始曾经既支持 iPhone 也支持 Android 。但却在近些年随着 Windows 10 的更新悄悄地取消了对 iOS 的支持（虽然原本其功能也仅限于将网页从手机端发送到电脑端），对应的也将 iOS 端的控制应用从 App Store 下架，这也使《你的手机》成为一款仅限于 Android 手机和 Windows 电脑之间的协同工具。

因此我们要想让 Windows 和 iPhone 实现协同就只能依赖第三方解决方案，糟糕的是可以提供通知同步、在桌面端收发短信这样基础协同解决方案的却寥寥无几，唯一我曾经使用的协同工具也只剩下功能羸弱的 Pushbullet，甚至在 Windows 上对 iPhone 的通知进行简单操作还需要付费订阅。
那么问题来了：有没有既支持桌面端通知同步、收发短信、文件互传同时又完全免费的Windows 与 iPhone 协同工具？
有，而且是此前就已经推荐过的 Dell Mobile Connect。
为什么「又」选择了它
你可能会觉得奇怪：既然很早之前就已经介绍了 Dell Mobile Connect，怎么时隔多年「又」一次进行重复的介绍？事实上这一次介绍的 Dell Mobile Connect 已经进化到了 4.0——虽然名称依旧是 Dell Mobile Connect，但相比之前介绍的旧版本，无论是从架构上还是功能上都有着巨大的改进。
而之所以又选择回 Dell Mobile Connect，更多的还是和我个人的使用习惯…</span>

作为一个副业码字、主业煮饭的重庆男人，我几乎承包了家里的所有劳动，清洁卫生是其中工作量最大、耗时最长的一项。本着工欲善其事必先利其器的原则（也就是能偷懒绝不动手），从住进来那天起，家里就陆续装上了厨余垃圾处理器、智能垃圾桶、吸尘器、洗地机和扫地机器人，个别产品甚至已经换了好几代。

今天想跟大家好好聊聊洗地机。
将从以下三个方面展开：

洗地机有什么优点，为什么推荐？
之前的洗地机有哪些缺陷？
新一代的洗地机有什么变化，还有哪些遗憾？
以后的洗地机还能怎么做？

洗地机有什么优点，为什么推荐？
简单来说，洗地机就是一种硬质地面清洁设备，它在用清水清洗地面的同时，还能带走地面污渍和吸干污水。商场和超市清洁员会经常使用类似的设备，可以称之为商用洗地机。

这玩意儿清洁效果出色，好用不费力，但很显然，我们不可能把这大家伙搬回家。好在工业社会一切皆可小型化，好用的东西最终都会走进千家万户，手持无线洗地机就这样出现了。

以往，我们清洁地板的顺序是扫帚扫走灰尘杂质，湿润拖把拖地，拖地过程中不断清洗拖布，这里面存在两个痛点：一是从扫帚到拖把需要更换设备，另一个是清洗拖布的频率会影响地面清洁效果。
洗地机的优势也就在这——首先它可以同时完成干湿垃圾的工作，也就是不再区分扫地还是拖地，啥都能带走。

效果是显而易见的，只要它能吸进去的都没问题，尤其处理地面顽固污渍、堆积较厚的尘土。

其次的一点也是我认为洗地机最大的优势——它自带清水箱和污水箱，在清洗地板的过程中可以实时清洗拖布，并且将产生的…</span>

                    <span>Once upon a time, Instagram links in tweets used to show a full-sized image preview, and tapping on the preview would take you to the post. However, Instagram later removed this ability, forcing anyone who wanted to see even a glimmer of the post to follow the link. After years of this annoyance, Instagram has

                    <span>来了来了，知乎第一冤大头到场
我特么实在是好奇这人说了啥，我一开始怀疑是不是媒体非要搞个大新闻，这位教授本身不是这个意思然后给曲解了……于是斥巨资（5000日元）注册了这个会，去在线听了他的演讲：

听完我觉得亏大了，各位千万别去，媒体并没有太曲解他的意思……
（鉴于这个是人家的版权我就不好直接放出来了，拿其他的图来代替一下大概说明一下吧）
首先井上教授交代一下背景知识，nsp14是个冠状病毒用来修复自己基因组的基因，这个基因假如彻底坏掉的话病毒的很容易出现一些致死性变异（对病毒自己致死不是对人），然后这个病毒就没法复制下去了，这个蛋白总体来说就是干这个用的，所以大部分冠状病毒的nsp14是很保守的

上一段不理解没关系，你就理解成病毒有个蛋白能给自己“打补丁”就好了
以及APOBEC（3A/3B）是人类的一个蛋白，用来做mRNA剪切的,该家族的成员是 C-to-U 编辑酶，实验证明有可能切掉一些ssDNA和RNA，同时这玩意如果打偏了可能会导致一些不好的结果比如细胞凋亡或者致癌：

上面那段话看不懂没关系，你理解成这是个人类用来防御病毒的武器就好了
以及呢这个APOBEC的3A/3B有个突变，在东亚和南美分布较多（黑色），在欧洲较少[1]：

上面那段话看不懂也没关系，你就知道亚洲人和南美人这种武器更牛逼就是了
然后这是日本最近几波的爆发与nsp14变异的分布图：

中间那个黄色的，也就是A394V跟最后一波爆发的数据比较接近
下一个问题，A394V的变异可以导致病毒自身突变变多吗？答案是可以的，由于A394是一个C-U的突变，会导致它更容易被APOBEC攻击[2]

而井上教授也做了细胞实验发现确实nsp14的变异会让病毒更不稳定
到这为止还都只是正常的在列数据，没有什么
好了，我们来整理一下（超级白话版）：

                    <span>日前，许多网络平台都流传多地人武部向预备役退伍军人发送“召回应战”短信的消息，这些短信的内容耸人听闻，直指近期敏感地区问题，后经有关部门核实，此信息确属谣言。

“兵者，国之大事”，军事信息向来都是机密信息、敏感信息，往往牵一发而动全身，必须慎之又慎。若要发布，一定是由权威部门通过合适手段进行发布，不可能如此草率。退而思之，此次涉军谣言之所以能在短时间内得到如此广泛的传播，与近段时间以来相关话题火热的舆论氛围不无关系。一些自媒体等平台奉行“流量为王”的经营理念，把炒作涉军话题作为提升关注度、获取点击量的捷径，频繁“蹭热度”、“瞎关联”、“乱解读”，将局部问题全局化，将简单事件复杂化，将一般事件热点化，造成舆论混乱。
“谗言罔极，交乱四国。” 荒诞的谣言从来都是恼人的坏事，只会搅乱局势带来不安。随着通讯及互联网技术的革新，广泛多样的即时通讯方式和网络社交平台给了我们每个人表达与分享的平台，也为每一个个体配上了一支“麦克风”，但这并不意味着可以看热闹不嫌事大“乱放风”。每一位公民都应知晓，互联网作为信息的集散地和社会舆论的放大器，既可以将资讯传播速度加快、传播力度增强，也能将谣言的破坏力放大。

不管是有人刻意为之还是其他什么原因，都需要往更深一步去思考：我们是否应该警惕某些别有用心的人借助网络隐匿性特点，故意炮制传播涉军谣言，煽动情绪、乱带节奏、搅乱舆论，以期达到其不可告人的目的？
谣言，始于利者，盛于焦虑，止于智者。国家统一的进程牵动人心，但在此时炮制这种涉军谣言，不仅干扰了国防军事行动的正常开展，而且随着这些涉军错误信息不断叠加传导、循环放大，还可能引起不明真相的社会公众误读误判，带来难以预料的后果。

网络是较量无声的平台，是没有硝烟的战场。在波谲云诡的国际政治和军事斗争中，信息战、舆论战越来越频繁地发生、多样化地发生、无孔不入地发生。事实上，每逢重大事件和军事热点发生前后，都会有谣言产生。因此，依法严厉打击涉军谣言，惩处相关人员，推动全社会普遍提高“谣言免疫”能力，是我们国防教育工作的重要组成部分。对于广大民众来说，擦亮双眼、提高警惕也十分必要，唯有如此才不会人云亦云、随风起舞，更不会受别有用心之人怂恿蛊惑，好心“帮倒忙”。

                    <span>前言 
Dreams are messages from the deep.
《沙丘》问了一个自从人类诞生以来就存在的问题：“假如真的有那么一个救世主能够看透一切，能否带领人类走向未来？”而这个答案绝对和你想象的完全不同。 
《沙丘》的影响力并不仅限于异想天开的世界， 这个讲述预言的故事自己也成为了现在最迫切需要警示的预言，《沙丘》层层堆叠的宇宙到底蕴藏了什么讯息，让我们一起进入《沙丘》这片险恶的荒漠之地。 
人类每次正视自己的渺小，都是自身的一次巨大进步。 ——Frank Herbert《沙丘》 
第一章：英雄的试炼 
在《沙丘》故事中，保罗·厄崔迪（Paul Atreides）从各个角度来看都是天选之人，万年难得一见的英雄， 他继承了父亲雷托·厄崔迪（Duke Leto Atreides）高贵的血统，从小就耳闻目染，也对任何人有如挚友一般敬重。 更是贝尼·杰瑟里特姐妹会（Bene Gesserit）的育种计划一万年以来小心翼翼培育出的结果，受到母亲杰西卡（Jessica Atreides）训练，拥有从来没有任何男性拥有过的强大心灵能力。
在故事中保罗来到了整个宇宙帝国中最险恶却最有价值、被称为“沙丘”的危险星球：厄拉克斯（Arrakis），成为了保罗英雄之旅的最终试炼场。
上次创造“厄拉克斯”，就是为了锤炼信徒 
正如电影中行星学家列特-凯恩斯博士（Dr. Liet-Kynes）说的：无论是机器或是人类都非常容易在沙丘中折损，不过保罗也证明了他绝对不是一般人。 
首先，保罗的第一个试炼就是贝尼·杰瑟里特姐妹会的「戈姆刺」测试，他必须把手放进圣母所拿的盒子里，受尽超越人体极限的神经酷刑，却不能把手抽出，否则会马上丧命，对贝尼·杰瑟里特姐妹而言，一个动物被困在陷阱里时会砍断自己的脚来逃脱，真正可以控制自己体内的任何一根神经的，是我们的对危机的洞察力，是自己的人类意志超越兽性…</span>

How to Build an Anycast Network
           
An anycast network is two or more servers advertising the same IP address from different locations. This is useful for globally distributed servers, so we user in a specific region are routed to server close to them in that region.
IPv4 addresses are silly, inet_aton(3) doubly so.
           
128 bit IPv6 addresses are cute and all, but how about… IPv∞? What happen if you do ping 3.14159264? Why it becomes 3.216.13.160
High throughput Fizz Buzz
           
The goal of this question is to write a FizzBuzz implementation that goes from 1 to infinity (or some arbitrary very very large number), and that implementation should do it as fast as possible.

                    <span>话说「Notability」“曾经”作为一款非常优秀的 iOS 平台手写笔记工具，无数人都会选择它作为自己学习和工作时进行快速记录和批注的首选，异次元也多次推荐过它。
然而自作死不可活，Notability 刚宣布改成订阅制，对已买断的用户只补偿一年时长！之后必须得付费订阅才能解除使用限制。这明摆着割韭菜的消息一出，网上简直骂声一片！！所以对此异次元特意给大家推荐其他的竞品，以及一款免费的替代品 CollaNote 帮大家过渡一下……
「 前往查看原文.... 」
异次元还有这些值得一看：

前言
Q：你一生中闻过最臭的东西，是什么？
A：我那早已腐烂的梦。
兄弟萌！！！我又来了！
这次，我能自信的对大家说：我终于给大家带了一个，能真正帮助大家解决诸多坑比场景的pub包！
将之前的flutter_smart_dialog，在保持api稳定的基础上，进行了各种抓头重构，解决了一系列问题
现在，我终于可以说：它现在是一个简洁，强大，侵入性极低的pub包！
关于侵入性问题
之前为了解决返回关闭弹窗，使用了一个很不优雅的解决方法，导致侵入性有点高
这真是让我如坐针毡，如芒刺背，如鲠在喉，这个问题终于搞定了！
同时，我在pub包内部设计了一个弹窗栈，能自动移除栈顶弹窗，也可以定点移除栈内标记的弹窗。
问题
使用系统弹窗存在一系列坑，来和各位探讨探讨
必须传BuildContext
在一些场景必须多做一些传参工作，蛋痛但不难的问题
loading弹窗
使用系统弹窗做loading弹窗，肯定遇到过这个坑比问题

loading封装在网络库里面：请求网络时加载loading，手贱按了返回按钮，关闭了loading
然后请求结束后发现：特么我的页面怎么被关了！！！
系统弹窗就是一个路由页面，关闭系统就是用pop方法，这很容易误关正常页面

当然肯定有解决办法，路由监听的地方处理，此处就不细表了
某页面弹出了多个系统Dialog，很难定点关闭某个非栈顶弹窗
蛋蛋，这是路由入栈出栈机制导致的，理解的同时也一样要吐槽
系统Dialog，点击事件无法穿透暗色背景
这个坑比问题，我是真没辙
思考
上面列举了一些比较常见的问题，最严重的问题，应该就是loading的问题
loading是个超高频使用的弹窗，关闭loading弹窗的方法，同时也能关闭正常使用的页面，本身就是一个隐患
本菜狗不具备大厂大佬们魔改flutter的能力，菜则思变，我只能从其它方向切入，…</span>

                    <span>我该如何安装一款插件？ 
简介
插件开启（需要同时在MarginNote 3的插件面板开启，并且确保文档界面的放大镜图标已被激活）后，选中任何英文单词（3个单词以内）会自动打开欧路词典并搜索该词。
这个插件最适用的使用平台是iPhone！用了就知道多爽
虽然也可以在macOS上使用，但由于在macOS上选词后欧路词典会成为first responder（不知道咋翻译，可以理解为欧路词典会被激活？），再回到MN需要多一次单击，所以不推荐在macOS使用。
设计这款插件的初衷
使用场景
阅读英文材料需要查阅词典时，哪里不会点（选中）哪里，省下了打字或复制粘贴的时间。
痛点需求
【痛点0】英语不好
其他说明
本插件是【第三方MN插件】#Ver.0.1# ReResearch——自动在外部浏览器搜索选中内容 的一个特殊版本。因为欧路词典搜单词这个需求比较简单具体，就单独拎出来申请了签名。
，但哪怕有一位用户需要的话，申请签名至少能帮他免掉恼人的弹窗。
单独给这个小功能申请签名有点不要脸，我本来是想给ReResearch申请签名的，那个插件理论上更强大更实用更灵活。但目前其灵活性建立在用户自己修改代码的基础上，这显然不应该。我希望用户不接触代码就可以自己选择用Google还是百度或者其他URL Scheme，但这需要在开发文档面世之后我才能思考怎么实现。

                    <span>写在前面
如果你在双十一期间打算买一台相机，但又不清楚单反相机和无反相机之间的区别，那么我建议你在 2021 年的选购一台无反是一个更好的选择。

无反相机无反相机的全称是无反光镜相机，与单反相机相比，无反相机减少了单反相机中的反光板，并将五棱镜替换为了电子取景器。因此，无反相机通常体积更小、重量更轻、拍照更安静，也深得不少消费者的喜爱。

 
关联阅读：从原理出发，寻找适合你的那一部——无反相机选购指南
但在如今鱼龙混杂的市场中，想要选择适合自己的相机是一件难事，本篇文章我将会列举最全面的数据对比，提供给大家最详细、最全面的干货，帮助大家选择最适合自己的无反相机。
如何选购适合自己的无反相机？
在选择相机之前，首先需要了解自己的拍照需求，用相机想街拍旅拍记录生活？还是想向专业的摄影方向发展？又或是完成自己的艺术创作？再或者说想拍妹子？拍婚礼挣钱？
无论是什么样的需求，都决定着自己使用相机频率的高低。毕竟我们都不希望自己花大价钱买到的生产力工具只能放在家里吃灰。在选购无反相机之前，明确自己的使用需求是必不可少的一环。
街拍（纪实摄影）的时候，首先要考虑轻便，以及续航和防抖；其次相机越大会给被摄对象越大的压力，所以要考虑购买小巧轻便的相机，不会对拍摄对象造成太大影响错失拍摄良机。
旅拍场景下，除了风景要考虑的要求，还需要考虑要不要自拍？ 为了能清晰的保证自己在画面内的构图，这时还要考虑购买拥有翻转屏的相机。
拍风景考虑宽容度，拍人像则要考虑色深。但是，拍体育运动和赛车因为较高的快门速度，想要拍出一张曝光正常的照片，就需要用高 ISO 来补偿极短的快门速度，所以对 ISO 和相机的低光环境拍摄能力要求比较高。
拍妹子和婚礼等场合，除拍摄人像需要考虑的色深等等以外，还需要考虑一个我称之为 尼康 800 定 的问题。在婚礼会议等正式场合，当你拿出一台小巧的相机时，对于摄影不那么了解…</span>

                    <span>Procreate 作为 iPad 上久负盛名的绘画工具，在多年无内购的免费更新后，依然维持着 68 元买断的价格。
近日，Procreate 又迎来了 5.2 版本的免费大更新，此次更新不仅对原有功能进行了进一步的完善升级，还开创性地新增了对 3D 模型的预览和贴图绘制的功能支持。以下是详细的更新内容介绍。

新增「3D 绘画」相关功能
作为此次更新中最「重量级」的变化，Procreate 首次支持导入 OBJ 与 USD 模型文件进行预览、贴图绘制和视频导出等操作。
3D 模型贴图绘制
你可以直接用手指选中模型中的一个或多个面，然后直接在模型上用 Apple Pencil 描绘贴图和纹理。这个 3D 贴图的绘制过程与你平时在一般画布中的作画方式基本一致，而你平时所使用的那些画笔、后期调色、滤镜效果等也自然都支持直接使用。

「照明工作室」
除了绘制贴图外，在「操作 - 3D - 编辑照明和环境」中还可以打开「照明工作室」，此处用于调整模型预览时光源的颜色和位置，以及背景环境光的类型。你最多可以在场景中设置 4 个光源。

新增画笔参数「材质」
在「画笔工作室」中，新增了一项针对 3D 贴图绘制的画笔参数「材质」。通过设置调整「金属」和「粗糙度」两组参数，可以赋予画笔在绘制 3D 贴图时的金属感或天鹅绒质感的反光效果。

导出展示动画
你可以在「操作 - 分享」中选择为 3D 模型创建并导出展示动画，可以让模型在视频中进行循环的全旋转或半旋转展示。

以 AR 模式查看模型
在「操作 - 3D - 以 AR 模式查看」下，你可以借助摄像头把你的模型置于你身边的任意可视平面中。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

在少数派发文不到一个月的时间里，我收获了 20 万阅读量，拥有了第一批粉丝，并开始着手运营自己的专栏「游戏博物馆」。在一切事务逐渐走入正轨，生活日渐繁忙之际，尽管投入到写作上的热情不减当初，我依然担心他日灵感枯竭，在内容输出上虎头蛇尾，作出些为他人不屑、为自己不齿的流水账来。而从此篇开始的「考物阁」系列即为探求内容输出多元化的求索之作。
避免灵感枯竭的最好办法就是在灵感迸发的瞬间将其记录下来，但对我来说，每天冒出的想法可能有成百上千，但其中真正能够落实成文的则寥寥无几。与其事无巨细的条条抄录筛选并任其在备忘录中「被忘」，不如抓住最吸引自己的只言片语，并将记录灵感的专注力转化为实打实的行动力——因此，「随时写作」成为了我的硬需求。
想要随时开启工作状态，精简设备是前提。私以为在写作这种相对简单的工作模式下，必需的生产力工具越简单就越高效；另外，比起在家中进行工作，我更倾向于到图书馆或咖啡厅这类「传统的生产力场景」中寻找灵感。出于续航、静音和轻量化的考虑，我放弃了外出重量达 1.7 KG（搭配努比亚 60W 氘锋 GaN 充电器和罗技 Pebble 蓝牙鼠标）的 ROG 幻 14 全能本，转而选择了为此前作为游戏机的 iPad mini 6 搭配蓝牙键盘的方案。
今日写作状态。
iPad mini 6 的体积不大，我希望与之搭配的蓝牙键盘也可以足够便携，如此一来就可以抛弃本不必要的双肩包。传统的蓝牙键盘可以做到轻薄，却没法在不压缩键帽的情况下提升便携性，能够解决这一问题的就只剩下了折叠键盘。与传统的蓝牙键盘相比，可选的折叠键盘其实并不…</span>

                    <span>首先丰收的是秋粮，那么
全国秋粮作物主要包括哪些？
朱娟（农业农村部种植业管理司农情信息处处长）：秋粮作物主要是玉米、中晚稻、还有大豆，另外还有一些春小麦和杂粮、杂豆，这里面的玉米大概占了52%左右，中晚稻占了37%，大豆占了4%，
大家很关心一个问题，夏粮和早稻都丰收了，但是我们知道像河南等地遭遇了暴雨洪涝灾害的影响，那么这种灾情对全国的秋粮生产（影响）有多大？
自然灾害对秋粮影响有多大
朱娟：确实正如您所说，今年极端天气比较多，局部像河南灾情确实比较重，但是整个全国面上的灾情总体偏轻。这里有两组数据，我给大家介绍一下，一个是重灾区的面积占秋粮（总面积）的整体比例是比较小的，今年受灾比较重的主要是集中在两个区域，一个是河南受涝，另外一个就是西北受旱，那河南大家也知道，“7·20”极端暴雨洪涝灾害，造成河南农作物受灾是一千五百多万亩，其中秋粮是一千一百多万亩，占到河南秋粮面积的14%左右，但是从全国来看，它仅占全国秋粮面积的1%左右。
所以这个大家一定要清楚，大家一想河南它是粮食生产大省，但其实从秋粮这个角度来看，它的占比在全国的占比并不高。
朱娟：而且河南的秋粮，还有六千五百多万亩没有受灾的秋粮，这部分作物长势不错，可以做到以丰补歉。另一块区域就是西北的受旱区域，西北陕西、甘肃、宁夏今年旱情比较重，受旱面积最大的时候达到了一千九百多万亩，这个占到全国秋粮面积大概1.5%左右，但是这里面因为它西北杂粮、杂豆的占比比较高，所以它是属于这种低产作物，对整个全国秋粮产量的影响也是很有限的。
那么除去这些受灾的地区，其他的整体上来看，没有受灾的地区秋粮长势怎么样？
朱娟：在秋粮生长发育期内大部分地区，光、温、水匹配比较好，就没有发生这种流域性的、区域性的、大范围的旱涝灾害，从我们调度的情况，6月以来，就是秋粮的主要生长发育期内，是近十年同期受灾是最轻的一年，特别是东北地区，今年雨水多，旱情非常轻，也没有发生像去年秋收前这种连续三个台风的袭击，所以东北今年是个大丰收年。
从敏芳那边的自己种植的情况来看，你们今年的水稻种植的过程当中，有没有遇到一些灾害性天气的影响？因为湖南也是水稻种植大省。
董敏芳：其实我们在种植过程当中，今年的早稻倒是碰上了“倒春寒”，但是通过我们的科学化种植，科技兴农我们采用的旱地育秧，有效地保障了秧苗的品质，我们是有效地防范了“倒春寒”的影响，所以对于我们的产量来讲没有造成影响。
今年秋粮丰收不容易
朱娟：今年秋粮克服了局部极端的洪涝、干旱以及病虫害重发等等不利因素，再获丰收非常不容易，今年秋粮面积，在去年已经增加了八百七十多万亩的基础上，今年进一步增加达到12.9亿亩以上。这是奠定了丰收的基础。今年国家继续实施稻谷、小麦最低收购价政策，而且把最低收购价提高了一分钱，此外扩大了玉米、大豆生产者补贴的资金的规模，还首次安排一次性实际种粮农民补贴资金总额达到200亿元，直接支持粮食生产的扶持政策，资金规模也进一步扩大，我们统计了一下，是增加了六十多亿元。农业农村部在关键农时派出了二十多个专家组和工作组，赴主产省指导生产。
在河南洪涝灾情发生后，中央财政安排专项资金，支持农业抗灾救灾。农业农村部第一时间组织专业力量指导抗灾救灾。调用两千多台抽水泵、组织5.8万农机手帮助重灾区抽排田间积水。派出22个专家小分队带物资、带技术，蹲点指导灾后改种补种。协调周边省份，捐赠救灾种子等农资，满足灾后改种补种的需要。绝收的五百多万亩秋粮，有一半进行了改种补种，挽回了部分损失。
在秋粮收获时，黄淮海地区遭遇极端天气影响，特别是山西陕西等地洪涝灾情严重。农业农村部立即组织专家组，指导当地抢收抢种。黄淮海地区的秋粮作物主要是玉米，据农情调度，截至目前，山西秋粮收获进度2/3左右。陕西秋粮收获进度3/4以上。两省反映，“十一”强降雨发生的时候，两省秋粮产量已基本形成，灾害对产量影响是有限的。农业农村部宣布，今年秋粮增产已成定局，秋粮面积稳中有增，目前收获已近8成。近期的连阴雨对产量影响总体有限，全年粮食产量将再创历史新高，连续7年保持在1.3万亿斤以上。

                    <span>大家好，我是震雷的孙猛，此次《识夜描银》改编动画的导演。
我是在2018年末开始思考《识夜描银》的动画改编工作的。我的第一件工作，就是作为系列构成，去寻找这个故事到底要讲什么。
作为文学影视作品，不单单的讲流水线式的剧情，而是深度发掘其内在的精神内核，将其想表达的东西传达给观众，引起观众思考，反思，回味，是本次改编的重点意义所在。
为此我与原作进行了很多交流，也得到了很多来自作者的创作资料，从而更好，更全面的了解了故事的全貌和内核。


“这个世界所有的力量，源自于信仰。
这句话可以说，是本作最核心的原则，心存善念，就会带来吉祥，心存恶念，就会招致毁灭。
看似唯心主义的东西，其实是体现了非常传统的东方思想，原作者在《识夜描银世界规律》一文中写道，”规律孕育万物，从草木变成人，有了众生，众生对大自然有了敬畏，产生了信仰，信仰缔造了神明，赋予了神明神权“，这是非常传统的老子道家思想的演化，非常中国味，同时也充满了哲理。这也是本作最打动我的地方。原作漫画里这一点表现的比较隐晦，所以在动画的改编过程中，这一点将作为中心思想，贯穿始终。
在这一点的基础上引申下去的话，也可以引出很多方面的反思，神明是人造的，人们又回过头去崇拜那个神明，将权利交付与他们，甘心受其统治，谁也没见过上天，但自我塑造出了天子，并将全部权利交付于他统治自己。不过太过深入的话，我觉得可能会跑偏到民主政治和独裁政治的讨论上去，那样的话也许会给本作招来不必要的麻烦，要不就算了吧（笑）。


在世界观上，本作和一般的武侠，玄幻类作品相比，也有着一个非常重大区别，那就是对于所谓的“鬼”这个概念的阐述。在绝大部分的此类作品，在这一点上都没有能够突破传统，而本作在这一点上，有着非常有深刻意义的设定，那就是这世界上没有鬼，而人是有灵魂的，人的灵魂分成三份，天魂，地魂，人魂。人死之后，天魂归天，地魂入地，人魂消散，归于虚无。这一…</span>

                    <span>2020 年末，Apple 在时隔近 3 年之后，终于推出了 HomePod 系列的新款产品。不过，出人意料的是，这款新产品并不是 2018 年初推出的 HomePod 的继任者，而是一款全新的智能音箱产品：HomePod mini。
又过了 1 年，Apple 在今年 10 月举行的发布会上，为 HomePod mini 更新了 3 种配色：黄色、橙色和蓝色。在我们身边，有不少之前没买 HomePod 或者 HomePod mini 的朋友，因为这次更新又起了入手的念头；也有一些想趁着新配色推出，再买一台与家里的音箱搭建立体声组合。
那么，HomePod mini 用起来到底怎么样呢？
我们请到了已经用上 HomePod mini 的少数派编辑和作者们，让他们来分享一下各自的使用体验。如果你也有入手「新款」HomePod mini 的想法，这篇文章也许能给你提供参考和帮助。
新配色好看，Apple 生态用户值得入手
@waychane：2019 年 HomePod 在大陆上市的时候，我便入手了这款产品。在过去将近 3 年的时间里，HomePod 几乎一直是我在家里听音乐的唯一设备；同时，它也是一位称职的家庭助理，可以用它方便地查天气、定闹钟等等；每天睡觉之前，我也会通过 HomePod 来将房间里的灯光关闭。
前不久，我还有机会提前拿到了全新配色的 HomePod mini 体验了一段时间，也来分享一下使用体验。
外观方面，与之前推出的黑 / 白配色类似，HomePod mini 的新款配色涵盖到了产品的方方面面：除了网状织物之外，控制面板上的音量加 / 减按键、硅胶材质底座，甚至是编织电源线配色都得到了统一。美中不足的是，HomePod 容易「落灰」的特性也在 HomePod mini 上得到了保留，毕竟表面用的是材质一样的网状透声织物，不定期地给音箱扫扫灰不可避免。
