                              <span>In the example below I have a sample app that I named owler_franchise in the setup process.

Now I want to change that to Owler Franchise.
iOS
For iOS, go to ios folder and find the folder named after your project name. 
owler_franchise. Inside that folder find the Info.plist file. 

Inside Info.plist file replace the value after CFBundleDisplayName to your app name.

For my example, I changed it to Owler Franchise. 

That&#x27;s it for iOS 👍.

Android
For Android: Go to the following folder in order: android &gt; app &gt; src &gt; main &gt; res &gt; values and open strings.xml file, replace the  tag&#x27;s value.


Again, in my example, I changed it to Owler Franchise:

That&#x27;s it for Android too ✅.

First let&#x27;s see what a Context Receiver is, before we take a look at how it can help us make our component easier to use.
Important: Kotlin Context Receiver is an experimental API, this means it could still be subject to change in the future, before a final release. Also the IDE support is currently limited as well.
Because of the experimental nature of Context Receivers, they are not enabled by default. To enable its usage we need to go to the build.gradle.kts or build.gradle file of our module and add -Xcontext-receivers as a free compiler arg.
In the build.gradle file of an Android module this looks something like this…</span>

                              <span>You know who I&#x27;m talking about right? It&#x27;s that entity/being that makes sure that your code does not function the same way in your local, development and production environments. Well, he&#x27;s a gnome and is called Bob Stinkycode.
I imagine he looks something like this after he&#x27;s messed with you:

Let&#x27;s see an example: you&#x27;ve been working on a feature for a while, you&#x27;ve tested and everything works perfectly. Then the code is deployed to a real environment and some part of the feature that worked and had been tested extensively before does not work. You check and double check and crap, theoretically it should work, you can&#x27;t explain why the hell it&#x27;s failing... and of course your code is perfect and the only posible explanation is that the Bob has done it again, he is messing with your code...
It&#x27;s a hard problem to solve, as Bob decides when to let the code work and when to mess with it. If you look for him you will not find him, he has 1000s of lines of code, 100s of folders and 10s of services and processes to hide... 
The only solution is to accept it, and let him get tired, once he get&#x27;s bored your code will work again... Don&#x27;t waste your time trying to solve it xD 
Another example: A user reports a bug, we have screenshots, reports in Sentry, and when we try replicating it, it never happens again. This is also Bob&#x27;s fault.

Jokes aside, I think Bob is just a metaphor of the ego and/or pride of a developer. Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to swallow, than to accept your code has flaws. I&#x27;m guilty of this, but try to always tell myself that bob is just uncertainty and ignorance about a bug. 
That&#x27;s it for me, hope you enjoyed the quick read. Do you have experience with Bob Stinkycode? How do you call him?

When it comes to a take-home coding challenge, the first thing that most developers think of is, &quot;Sweet! I can just google for the answer&quot;. However, this is where they all fail.
So, how do you pass to take home coding challenge?
1. Take your time understanding the problem, there is no fire.

When I receive a technical challenge, I would read it multiple times and take notes on what has been asked to develop. My notes would consist of what I have to do step by step, so I won&#x27;t waste time on something that the requirement didn&#x27;t even ask. For example, this is what my notes would look like:

                              <span>It&#x27;s only natural for us humans, to get distracted by literally anything other than what we should focus on.
The same can be said for reading articles.
For browsers there is a feature called reader mode, it removes all the distractions from the webpage so you can focus on the content itself.

For Chrome however, this is not yet a public feature, but you can enable it today!
And i&#x27;ll show you how you can do just that.
Open up your Google Chrome browser and in the address bar type the following link: chrome://flags.
This will open a page where you can control certain flags for your browser.
In the top search field search for: &quot;Enable Reader Mode&quot;.
You&#x27;ll notice a dropdown on the side of it, it should be set to default. Change this value to be enabled.

As soon as you change this value Chrome will ask you to relaunch your browser.
Now that you have reader mode enabled, visit any article, for instance use the one you are on right now.
In the address bar you&#x27;ll now notice this little symbol that looks like a newspapper.

Once you click it, it transform the webpage to a read only page.

                              <span>A struct is a typed collection of fields, useful for grouping data into records. This allows all the data relating to one entity to be neatly encapsulated in one lightweight type definition, behavior can then be implemented by defining functions on the struct type.
This blog I will try to explain how we can efficiently write struct in terms of Memory Usages and CPU Cycles.

Let’s consider this struct below, definition of terraform resource type for some weird use-case I have:
type TerraformResource struct {
  Cloud                string                       // 16 bytes
  Name                 string                       // 16 bytes
  HaveDSL              bool                         //  1 byte
  PluginVersion        string                       // 16 bytes

There are compute services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate, while there are other integration services which binds various compute services, like AWS Step Functions, Amazon API Gateway, etc.
In this article, we are going to explore AWS Step Functions.
The official definition of AWS Step function is as follows:
Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. Through Step Functions&#x27; graphical console, you see your application’s workflow as a series of event-driven steps.
One of the most important characteristics of Step functions is that it uses Finite State Machines (FSM) model. The state machi…</span>

                              <span>CI jobs typically execute in a freshly spun-up container, with no leftover state from previous runs. This helps ensure that builds are repeatable. However it can also make them much slower than they need to be. Each run has to repeat a lot of time-consuming setup work, such as downloading and installing tools, and cannot rely on work done by previous runs, as you would when running build commands iteratively on your desktop.
Therefore most CI/CD providers offer a caching facility to speed up runs by selectively restoring state from previous runs. But because the details of your build workflows are opaque to the CI providers, they can only cache at a very coarse-grained level, and this limits how much benefit you can get from them.  Read on to see why!

                              <span>在本指南中，我们将解释在 Arch Linux 中安装漂亮的深度桌面（DDE）所需的步骤。


指南的第一部分解释了安装 Arch 基本系统的步骤。第二部分是在 Arch Linux 的基础上安装完整的深度桌面。

什么是深度桌面（DDE）？

深度操作系统 是一个基于 Debian 稳定分支的、功能丰富且漂亮的桌面环境。深度桌面环境（DDE）是深度操作系统自主开发的桌面环境。它由它自己的 dde-kwin 窗口管理器驱动。深度桌面带有漂亮的停靠区和许多预装的深度原生的应用程序。

这个令人眼花缭乱的桌面环境 可在 Arch 仓库中找到；这篇文章介绍了如何在 Arch Linux 中安装深度桌面。

本指南安装深度桌面环境 20.1。然而，其他版本的步骤也应该是类似的。

第一部分：安装 Arch Linux

如果你已经安装了 Arch Linux，你可以跳过这一步，直接进入安装深度桌面部分。

要快速安装基本的 Arch Linux，请按照以下步骤进行。你也可以访问 本指南 了解以双启动或在虚拟机上安装 Arch Linux 的完整教程。

下载 Arch Linux

从下面的链接下载 Arch Linux 的 .iso 文件。这里有磁力链和 BT 链接。一旦你下载好了，就把 ISO 写入 U 盘。然后从该驱动器启动。


下载 Arch Linux


如果你打算通过 GNOME Boxes、virt-manager 将其安装为虚拟机镜像 —— 那么你不需要将其写入 U 盘。

启动和配置分区

从 Arch Linux ISO 启动后，你必须运行一系列的命令来安装基本系统。

首先，运行下面的命令，找出设备的标识符。

fdisk -l




然后用此设备标识符，运行下面的命令，开始对你的磁盘进行分区。请确保根据你的系…</span>

日式整理术的概念，出自《佐藤可士和的超整理术》，是一种能够指导生活方式或是影响工作流的方法论。根据佐藤的阐述，其整理术主要分为三个维度。

空间整理术 —— 讲求「物」的固定位置，归类，优先级的排序；留下或是扔掉。
信息整理术 —— 对文字、图片影像、数据的线形，树形或网状结构归纳。
思维整理术 —— 对「抽象」「混沌」等概念性、无意识内容的可视化、语言化或“意识化”；保存或是删除。

空间整理术 —— 「对所有之物的斟酌」

有关于「量」

我自己从小就是一个囤积狂魔，所有必需品必须是用一囤一，对心爱的事物不满足于只拥有一种款式。横向上我希望有用时下同一系列的所有款式（也就是收集癖），纵向上我期待所有新品，对热门稀有款更是虎视眈眈。后来我长大了，刚刚对金钱有一些许自由支配权，我就理所当然地又被各种社交媒体上的“花花世界”掌控—— 大牌口红的当季热门色号、各种各样像调色盘一般的眼影腮红盘、成份奇妙能使一夜回春的护肤品、花里胡哨的快时尚单品…… 它们没有一样不在扰动我欲望的神经。我的多巴胺就在等快递的时候无限分泌，在拆快递的时候达到顶峰，又在切实拥有“美物”的一瞬间消失殆尽，周而复始，无限循环。
而我的懒惰又让我所能真正使用到位的物品少之又少，每天早起让我没有太多时间化全妆，没有办法好好搭配我买的每一件“潮流单品”。为了避免太扎眼的look，我还是会因为效率和时间而选择低饱和的经典款和各种黑白灰。可谓是身在“潮”营，心在“汗”，穿搭博主穿她的，我依旧我行我“素”。
我并没有因为这些物品赋值，反而被夺去了自由 —— 我被时下热门控制了钱包，被塞得满满的房间夺走了空…</span>

                              <span>许多年前，有一个刚毕业的小镇青年，战战栗栗的步入了社会。在求职四处碰壁后，总算混到了一份在语言培训机构里做宣传招生的工作。按理说他应该要开心才对，但小镇终究是小镇，消费低工资低，房价很高。

于是小镇青年开始寻找兼职，最终总算托朋友的关系兼职了一份平面+3D效果师的工作。那时候自媒体刚刚兴起，小镇青年也步入了这行，不过也只能算是兼职。而后就是白天上班摸鱼，晚上画效果图，深夜为原创码字的日子。虽然很忙也很累，但小镇青年却觉得很充实。
几年下来，小镇青年也累积了几百篇的图文内容，虽然他在自媒体这行中也没有多少成就，也没有出现任何爆文，但他却获得了分享的乐趣。现在小镇青年开始折腾视频内容了，那么他又有什么经验值得分享呢?

Intro
首先是软件学习，Adobe Premiere Pro最好要会用，当然现在许多短视频也可以在手机上实现剪辑，比如剪映就是这样的工具。但个人觉得，最终还是要向专业靠拢的，所以Adobe Premiere Pro还是得要会用。

技巧学习上主要是转场效果。可以多看看别人的作品，从模仿开始。快慢帧和特效无缝转场要多学习一下，收集几套免费的剪辑素材和资料包。因为不是团队作战，所以精力会比较有限，所以脚本尽量参考别人的。如果不方便自己配音的话，可以考虑用机器声，比如剪映的文本朗读功能又或者是微软的Azure文本转语音。
这里推荐微软Azure云服务文字转语音功能。
azure.microsoft.com/zh-cn/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/

具体方式是使用它的试听功能+脚本插件来完成下载。插件名称是“Azure Speech Download”，以及Tampermonkey脚本。

/t/868776 有感
最近在培养下属进行团队管理，今天转了这篇文章给他，领导者管人的 10 条铁则，学会了，管人原来很简单：
https://sa.sogou.com/sgsearch/sgs_tc_news.php?req&#x3D;gNWjMh9kjpEtYgjReTdUXeJ_0xWrwbxWSExkKumgzN86VAnEKscI-EO-ByOQCJaC&amp;user_type&#x3D;1
不知道他能不能 get 到管理的技能点，尤其是培训他的下属的方法论。
过了没多久，我发现他在培养新人时，只是给人家转发了个这种文章——新手程序员必学 10 大技能： https://www.zentao.net/redirect-index-21640.html
这篇文章说的太泛泛，而且其实一些领域日后深挖的空间很大不是一朝一夕就能进阶的，更没有结合工作实践，培养技术新人的比较好的方法，应该是首先要有自己的项目规范，分配任务给新人后，既要指导技术相关的知识点，也要教新人工作流相关的流程、工具，还要根据新人的性格特点来促进他与团队的磨合、沟通能力的提升。
我最近带他有点累，怎么说呢，我可以理解他刚承担一点管理职责，有很多的欠缺管理经验的想法，总觉得自己只要去教就是尽职尽责了。可是培训新人总是方法失当、效果不好、 ，也不顾新人的基础、性格特点。这样管理下来，不仅不能帮助新人成长、提升新人效率不说，反而导致新人工作态度更加消极。
我刚开始承担管理只能的时候，我的师傅不会毫无方法论地去随便转发点资料给我然后任我野蛮生长根据自己的喜好来处理管理事务，那时候自己也觉得做管理要讲究方法论、希望早日习得师傅的高效团队管理的方法论，所以我总是虚心从师傅做事方法上分析，把管理这种无形的抽象艺术总结出可以有效执行的方法论。可现在的新人管理者总感觉管理就是转发点技术的资料给别人自学就可以了，更不要说去细心教知识和团队协作了。好心想帮他并且也给他分析过培训新人与纯写代码的区别但是他似乎还没有非常理解管理是门艺术，不知道怎么处理，想着发篇文章给他分享，他能有感悟，真是自己想多了。
10 条贴则，我都觉得不够，因为人、事是很复杂的。基本的管理能力、沟通表达、做事方法的能力这些都是必备的。说回来，我应该怎么帮助他提升管理水平呢，总不能一直让他这么瞎管把团队越管越差吧？</span>

目前有个前端打点的 POST JSON 接口，每个客户端 5s 请求一次，因为前后端域名不是同一个，每次都会有 options 请求，不管是前端控制台还是后端日志，看着很不舒服，另一方面，如果请求量大，感觉会有无谓的性能消耗。  
看微信读书的打点也是个 POST 接口，不过人家页面和接口，用的相同的域名。  
我这边换域名是不现实了，调整方案想到两个：  
改成 GET 请求，奈何信息堆起来有点多，拼接起来看上去很乱
限制 header 字段信息，修改 content-type ，弃用 application/json 格式，又要重新写鉴权中间价

&quot;感谢您的回信。正如电话中沟通的内容。您申请保修的型号 NUC11PHKi7CAA/BTPH1040009K/M26148-402 在生产时预装 Optane™ 内存 32GB+512GB 存储、16GB 内存及 Windows® 10 操作系统。缺少原装部件的产品不适用于有限保修条款，所以我们无法为此台设备提供有限保修服务。&quot; - by INTEL 客服
这个 NUC 是天猫店买的，买来的时候是包含原装内存与硬盘。嫌 16G 太少了，买来就卖掉换了 64G 别的内存
现在 typeC 口无法接显示器，售后指导一些方法都无法解决后提出可以退货，但是我表明内存已经卖掉后就回复我以上邮件，打电话过来告诉我“保修得是整体，更换内存或硬盘后不保修”
这种说法合理吗？个人感觉电脑换个硬盘内存是很正常行为。因为更换了内存，其他部件出故障就不提供保修了吗？</span>

                              <span>vodmaker: 这是一个社会组织实验，也是一个创业项目。
这是一个什么组织？
--------------
这里是一种 DAO 组织，一种去中心化自治组织，是一种与传统公司组织截然不同的一种组织方式。公司以盈利为目的而构建，由几个管理者带领一众员工为完成盈利的目的一同协作，并定期发放工资以期维系员工与组织的这种关系。
而，这里，建立的伊始并不全然以盈利为目的，当然成员在这里完全有可能实现收入的可能。这个目的可以是由第一位创始人设立，也可以由后续的创始人修改或者重新发起。为了直奔主题，我（第一位创始人）设立的这个组织的第一个目的是建立一个自治并持续发展的组织。为了达成如上目标，我希望通过一系列的规则和激励措施来完成。
基本规则
-------
1. 自愿加入并且自愿退出
2. 加入方式为在本 Repo 发起一个 Merge Request ，将个人基本信息和擅长的技能，如果有别的对组织发展有利的信息也可以一并发出。经过审核后即代表加入组织。
3. 项目发起人（组织的一种角色）可以不定期发起有利于组织发展的项目，可以是完善组织管理的工具，也可以是提供一个让组织成员更有幸福感的建议，当然，也可以是一种盈利的项目。所有成员均有机会竞选参与这个项目，完成后会针对该项目对组织的共享程度将项目积分分配给项目成员，并根据成员的贡献度将积分分配给项目参与人员。（积分分配的机制以尽可能公平、公正的原则，通过积分分配委员会的审核，并一种有限次数的申述机会来保证积分的分配制度的公平）。
4. 投票制度，创始人，项目发起人，积分分配委员均通过定期的投票会议从所有成员中选出。下面具体描述一下每种角色的投票制度：
1. 创始人，创始人由第一位选择性的退出或者自愿降级为成员后，由全员参与投票，每一位成员的投票会根据其积分（贡献度）对其进行加权。
2. 项目发起人，每一个固定周期均有机会产生任意数量的项目发起人，项目发起人对项目全权负责，完成后会在项目积分中按照 60%的比例划分至其个人积分中，如果中途离开项目或者项目没有达成预期的目标，其将不会拥有积分。但项目成员仍能根据贡献程度获取积分。
3. 积分分配委员会，会长由投票产生，投票机制与创始人投票机制一致。委员会成员也是有投票产生，但成员的投票并不会根据积分进行加权。
激励措施
-------
组织初始股份 100%（类似公司制度的股份），创始人作为项目发起人拥有 5%，其余均为未分配状态。项目成员可以通过积分根据当前兑换的加个进行兑换。兑换价格根据当前所产生的积分和目前剩余股份按照一定规则产生。每个周期可以根据公司的盈利情况根据股份按一定规则进行奖金的发放。
加入方式
-------
进入 git 连接，在 members 文件夹下放入一个以 github 账号为名字的文件，将如下信息填入后发起一个 Merge Request ，审核通过后即为成员。
需要填写的信息：
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
github 账号：
wechat 账号：
所在城市：
擅长技能：
其他：
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
核心合伙人
---------
在加入后，符合合伙人意向并通过创始人确认的，可以成为核心合伙人并分配 2-5%的股份。

一
最近正好公司里有个需求，一个短信业务接了多个第三方供应商，某些业务需要查询第三方供应商剩余的短信包数量去选择剩余量最多的渠道去批量发送。有些业务是指定了某个短信供应商，有些场景需要根据业务的值去动态判断该用哪个供应商。场景非常复杂，还经常变化。
以前的代码实在惨不忍睹，选择剩余量最多的渠道是一个个去查的，然后获得结果去比较。至于指定的供应商和根据业务的值去判断选择供应商则是用大量的 if else 去嵌套各种判断。每次看到这坨代码真的觉得太粗糙了。关键是有些供应商还经常变，新接的供应商需要替代旧的供应商，加入这一大坨代码里。业务的判断条件还时不时变化一下。
出了几次问题之后，领导看不下去了，叫我想办法去优化。
我理了理逻辑，整个关系图应该是这样的，其中我把一个个去查的变成了并行去查，为了节约串行去查的 IO 耗时问题。

其中有些复杂查库逻辑，判断幂等性的步骤我就去掉了。只挑选了关键的步骤画上去。
叫我去重构这个慢慢写也能写出，但是关键的是，每个步骤和判断逻辑还时不时变化下。这就要求我的代码非常灵活。所以在设计时，一直很苦恼该如何去设计。
二
在小组开交流会的时候，有其他组的小伙伴和我安利了一个开源框架-LiteFlow。
经过研究这款开源框架，发现 LiteFlow 是一个国产规则引擎，能够编排任意复杂的流程，还支持热刷新。这基本上完全契合我的需求啊！
文档很详细，很 NICE ，大概看了半天就全部学完了。发现新版本的 LiteFlow 的规则是用 EL 表达式来写的。语法总共数下来也就 10 个左右，非常好理解。
比如这种图：

在 LiteFlow 用规则表示就是：

    THEN(
        a,
        WHEN(b, THEN(c, d)),
        e

现在网络上低质量的内容越来越多，特别是一些有争议性的讨论下，有些创作者为了流量 /热度，故意利用谬论来&quot;佐证&quot;自己的观点。
这些错误在一些网龄较久的网民看来一目了然，但是在另外一些网民面前却不能很快的识别出来。
并且这些创作者自然知道，只需要针对性的创造另外一些网民的乐意看到的内容。
但是，当我想要提醒被误导网民，反驳这些创作者的时候，以我自己的水平，似乎不太容易快速的总结归纳出他的谬论的「类型」。
例如当创作者偷换概念的时候、使用不恰当的类比的时候、如何快速的确认他现在属于那种谬误?例如当他们「混淆视听，引入不相干话题」的时候，快速识别出这是「红绯鱼谬论」。
例如知乎上一篇「吴啊萍的身份官方调查公布是否令大众信服?」 回答。
这篇回答在我看来，里面有很多逻辑错误，我知道哪里的逻辑是不合理的，为什么是不合理的。但是我想尝试用「谬误类型」来进行归纳，简单快速的指出某段内容是什么谬误的时候，却有点麻烦。这个 谬误列表 上的类型非常多，不同的内容不太容易快速的定位。
可以通过什么学习来快速的识别谬误类型吗?这样当别人提出谬论的时候，可以快速的指出「你这是 xxx 谬误，xxx 谬误指得是 xxxxxxxx 」，这样一定很帅 ;-0 。</span>

最近在带新人，今天转了这篇文章给他，新手程序员必学 10 大技能： https://www.zentao.net/redirect-index-21640.html ，他有点生气。
我最近带他有点累，怎么说呢，我可以理解新人刚毕业，有很多的想法，总觉得自己很牛。可是写的代码总是会有很多的 bug ，也不顾前后。不帮助团队提升效率不说，反而大家要加班帮忙解 bug 。
我刚毕业的时候，我师傅劈头盖脸的训我，那时候也觉得不想被人瞧不起狠狠学了好久，可现在的新人孩子总感觉你说什么都听不进去，更不要说骂了。好心想帮他，不知道怎么处理，想着发篇文章给他分享，他能有感悟，真是自己想多了。
10 项技能，我都觉得不够。基本的学习能力、沟通表达能力这些都是必备的。说回来，我应该怎么帮助他呢，总不能一直拖后腿。</span>

本文比较啰嗦，更倾向于是自言自语。不过我写完回顾，这更像是这段时间，自由思考的总结 :P
不过我不是游戏领域的人，这部分都是业余摸鱼思考的记录，如果有勘误，请与我联系，非常乐意交流。
文章可能需要 30 分钟。
主要涉及的主题：
游戏之难
游戏基本构成
游戏引擎

Logitech has announced a lineup of PC gaming accessories that are designed to be more gender-inclusive — and specifically geared toward women — than any of its previous releases. Companies shouldn’t be trying to market consumer technology by gender in 2022 and should instead recognize the wide variety of tastes and physical needs consumers have. But Logitech’s gone and done it anyway.
And the gadgets in the Aurora collection do seem cool, and notably, they’re new — not just new colorways of existing products. But aside from a few interesting features across the entirety of the Aurora collection, it still feels like a case of the pink tax at work.

The Bash command line is a great way to automate tasks. Whether you are running Linux on a server and need to manipulate log files or other data, or you&#x27;re a desktop user who just wants to keep files tidy, you can use a few automation features in Bash to make your work easier.
Linux for command: Automate tasks on a files
If you have a bunch of files to work on at once, and you need to do the same thing with every file, use the for command. This command iterates across a list of files, and executes one or more commands. The for command looks like this:
for variable in list
do
done

Excluding HTML, PDF files are probably the most popular document format on the web. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not compact. For example, I like to download free eBooks. A quick glance at my eBook directory shows that its 75 PDF files consume about 500 megabytes. On average, that&#x27;s over 6.6 MB for each PDF file.
Couldn&#x27;t I save some storage space by compressing those files? What if I want to send a bundle of them through email? Or host them for download on a website? The transmission would be faster if these files were made smaller. This article shows a simple way to reduce PDF file size. The benefit is that it shrinks your PDFs transparently without altering the data content in…</span>

                              <span>虽然太平洋台风胚胎已经启动，但因为副高仍然维持巨无霸状态，下沉气流猖獗，我国南方的高温缓解有限，在8月前可能仅限于江浙沪和福建北部沿海，而闽南、华南和华中的高温还可能加强；与此同时，东海和南海的海温极高，台风胚胎到近海之后，有突然发展的可能；双台风胚胎带来的复杂气流，对北方防汛防强对流也会有不利影响。总之，好台风不常有，对这两个台风胚胎，我们不应该抱有太多的期待，而是应该一边防暑，一边做好防台防暴雨准备。

通过使用 Kexec，可以避免了服务器加电重启等任务带来的停机时间。但是，即使使用 Kexec 来切换到一个新的内核，仍然可能需要太多的停机时间。通过字节跳动提交的新补丁，这些时间可以被优化掉 500ms，从而使启动内核功能的时间降低到只有 15ms。像许多其他大型组织一样，字节跳动依靠 Kexec 重启来转移到新的内核。

实时 Linux 内核支持接近进入主线

多年来，一直有关于 PREEMPT_RT “即将” 进入主线的说法，但限于资金而最终没有实现。PREEMPT_RT 支持是构建实时 Linux 内核的两个“路障”之一。今年的变化是英特尔收购了 Linutronix 公司，该公司是参与 PREEMPT_RT 补丁的主要公司之一。如果在下周的合并窗口前及时审查/签署了最后几个剩余部分，那么对 PREEMPT_RT 支持可能最终会在即将到来的 Linux 5.20 周期中被主线化。

老王点评：一旦 Linux 对实时内核的支持能进入主线，Linux 的疆域将又扩大一大块。

                              <span>下面我将介绍我是如何在 Linux 的 GNOME 桌面上使用 Rhythmbox 听在线音乐和 MP3 列表的。


对我来说，在完全安静的环境下工作是很困难的。我需要某种背景音，最好是一些熟悉的音乐。我在音乐上的需求很简单：我只需要一个音乐播放器，可以播放我的 MP3 音乐库和少数几个我喜欢的网站的在线音乐。

我在 Linux 上尝试了多个音乐播放器，最终我还是选择了 Rhythmbox。 Rhythmbox 是一个 GNOME 桌面音乐播放器。如果你的 Linux 发行版使用的是 GNOME 桌面，很可能已经安装了 Rhythmbox。它很简单，用来播放我本地的音乐库和广播网站的在线音乐。我很乐意在 Linux 上使用 Rhythmbox 收听在线音乐和我自己的音乐库。

在 Linux 上收听在线音乐

Rhythmbox 支持多个在线音乐服务商。如果你拥有一个 Last.fm 或者 Libre.fm 的帐号，你可以点击左侧的标签登录。或者，你想收听在线广播，点击左侧的“广播Radio”标签，在预设的广播网站中选择一个。在我写代码的时候我通常喜欢听迷幻舞曲，HBR1 Tranceponder 是我最喜欢的一个在线广播网站。



在 Linux 上播放我的音乐库

在过去的几年中，我收集了大量的 MP3 音乐。由于几年前 MP3 的专利在美国已经到期，它在 Linux 是一种很好用的开放的音乐格式。

我把我 20GB 的 MP3 音乐保存在我的主目录之外，在 /usr/local/music 。要把音乐导入 Rhythmbox，点击 “导入Import” 按钮，选择 usr/local/music 目录，或者任何你保存音乐的目录，让 Rhythmbox 去识别 MP3 音乐。结束以后点击 “导入列出的曲目Import listed tracks” 按钮导入就完成了。





Rhythmbox 可以播放我的音乐，并通过类型，艺术家和专辑组织歌曲，所以我可以很容易找到我想听的音乐。



旋律永存

我愿意在 Linux 上使用 Rhythmbox 作为我的音乐播放器，它是如此简洁，不会影响到我。而且听音乐可以帮我和谐掉日常的噪音，让我每一天都可以过的快一点。

国外一位程序员喜得贵子之后，颇受婴儿喂奶之苦 —— 我想养过孩子的人都有过这种体验。但是作为 AI 工程师，他花费了 50 个小时开发了一套 AI 系统，通过识别婴儿状态来判断是否该喂奶了，并通过手机发送通知给他去喂奶 —— 而不是给他老婆，从而可以让老婆有个良好睡眠。甚至，他还进一步开发了一套全自动喂奶装置，虽然还不太尽如人意，但是已经让全世界奶爸们感到了希望，纷纷催促他开源。

国内 Go 语言爱好者发起新编程语言：凹语言

国内三位 Go 语言爱好者发起了一种实验性的新编程语言：凹语言™（读作“Wa”）。但从其官网看，这个语言似乎从 2019 年就开始设计了。目前代码已经发布在 Github，并且提供了简单可执行的示例，不过该项目采用了“保留所有权利”的版权声明（可能是还没来得及确定许可证）。在语言设计中遵循了 Go 语言克制的风格，大量借鉴了 Go 的设计思想和具体实现。比较有趣的特性包括：披着 Go 和 Rust 语法外衣的 C++ 语言；其 WaGo 语法是 Go 的真子集；支持中文/英文双语关键字，任一关键字均有等价的中文及英文版。

大多数开源开发者都在关注新的工作机会

根据一份基于面向全球 1400 名应用开发者、IT 管理人员、运营和业务管理专业人才的问卷报告显示，尽管还算满意，但 44% 的开发者仍在关注工作选择；另外 10% 的受访者对他们目前的工作不满意。2/3 的受访者声称分配给他们的工作量增加。调查还显示，1/3 的受访者会考虑离开目前的职位，以便有机会使用更尖端的技术，比 2021 年仅 16% 的比例高出一倍。

                              <span>我对终端Terminal是怎么回事困惑了很久。

但在上个星期，我使用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示了一个交互式终端，我终于想到要问一个相当基本的问题：当你在终端中按下键盘上的一个键（比如 Delete，或 Escape，或 a），发送了哪些字节？

像往常一样，我们将通过做一些实验来回答这个问题，看看会发生什么 : )

远程终端是非常古老的技术

首先，我想说的是，用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示一个终端可能看起来像一个新事物，但它真的不是。在 70 年代，计算机很昂贵。因此，一个机构的许多员工会共用一台电脑，每个人都可以有自己的 “终端” 来连接该电脑。

例如，这里有一张 70 年代或 80 年代的 VT100 终端的照片。这看起来像是一台计算机（它有点大！），但它不是 —— 它只是显示实际计算机发送的任何信息。

EC_VT100_terminal.jpg&quot;&gt;

当然，在 70 年代，他们并没有使用 Websocket 来做这个，但来回发送的信息的方式和当时差不多。

（照片中的终端是来自西雅图的 活电脑博物馆Living Computer Museum，我曾经去过那里，并在一个非常老的 Unix 系统上用 ed 编写了 FizzBuzz，所以我有可能真的用过那台机器或它的一个兄弟姐妹！我真的希望活电脑博物馆能再次开放，能玩到老式电脑是非常酷的。）

发送了什么信息？

很明显，如果你想连接到一个远程计算机（用 ssh 或使用 xterm.js 和 Websocket，或其他任何方式），那么需要在客户端和服务器之间发送一些信息。

具体来说：

客户端 需要发送用户输入的键盘信息（如 ls -l）。 服务器 需要告诉客户端在屏幕上显示什么。

让我们看看一个真正的程序，它在浏览器中运行一个远程终端，看看有哪些信息会被来回发送！

Prepping for a summer cookout? If you head over to Amazon right now, you can pre-order the retailer’s hottest new charcoal grill: the Google Pixel Buds Pro.
Yes, that sentence you just read didn’t make a lot of sense, but Amazon’s search engine thinks it does! The algorithm has apparently decided that not only do the new charcoal colored earbuds count as a “charcoal grill,” they’ve apparently been the best-selling product in that category for over 24 hours now (via Reddit and Mishaal Rahman) without Amazon doing anything about it.
See for yourself:

Remember when everyone wanted to own your phone and your laptop? Dell’s finally tossing in the towel (via Windows Central).
On a support page, Dell announced that it’s discontinuing Mobile Connect, the program that syncs your phone’s texts, calls, and notifications to your computer. While Dell is stopping downloads on November 30th for users in the US, Canada, and Japan, it will no longer be available to use starting January 31st, 2023. The service is shutting down even earlier for users outside these three countries, with downloads stopping on July 31st and a total shutdown occurring on November 30th.
Dell Mobile Connect — sometimes called Alienware Mobile Connect — made its debut in 2018 and is, naturally, supposed to work best with...

Best Buy is opening a digital-first, small-format store on Tuesday in Monroe, North Carolina, that takes a very different approach than most of its “big box” retail locations. The 5,000-square-foot location is only about 15 percent as big as the typical 35- to 40,000-square-foot Best Buy location and is even smaller than many smaller Apple Stores, which are typically between 6,000 to 8,500 square feet.
Bloomberg reported last year that Best Buy was testing downsized locations of about 27,000 square feet to as small as 15,000 square feet, but this is much smaller, squeezing nearer to the now-closed Best Buy Mobile footprint. This test store is in the Charlotte area, where Best Buy also launched five other test stores last year, trying...

A giant pipeline spewed millions of gallons of fuel into a nature preserve for more than two weeks until two teens on four-wheelers noticed the spill and alerted authorities.
The teenagers discovered the leak in the Colonial Pipeline in August 2020 in the Oehler Nature Preserve outside Charlotte, North Carolina, E&amp;E News reports. Just how massive the leak actually was — about 2 million gallons — came to light recently on Friday, July 22nd. 
Colonial Pipeline Company was required to give an updated estimate of the damage because of a recent consent order with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The company had previously reported that the spill released 63,000 gallons of gasoline shortly after the spill was discovered.

Unsurprisingly, it seems like the type of people who shun vaccinations are not great at preventative cybersecurity either.
As reported by the Daily Dot, “Unjected” — a dating site specifically for people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 — failed to take basic precautions to keep users’ data secure, leaving sensitive data exposed and allowing potentially anyone to become a site administrator.
The “Unjected” site was set up to leave the administrator dashboard fully accessible to anyone who knew how to look for it. Through this dashboard, an administrator could access user information for any member of the site, including name, date of birth, email address, and (if provided) their home address.

Genshin Impact’s impending Sumeru update is set to add some beautiful new areas to explore, and the game’s developers shared a look at some of the new zones in a new video.
The new areas will be divided into two major zones: a rainforest and a desert, environment artist Jax Huang says in the video. The rainforest is filled with rolling hills, lush vegetation, and towering trees. The desert biome, on the other hand, is more sparse but also contains ruins with intricate architecture.

If you’ve opened Instagram recently and noticed more Reels on your feed or less engagement on your posts and felt the platform was beginning to look a liiiittle too much like TikTok, you’re not alone. The app’s second most-followed person agrees.
Kylie Jenner shared a screenshot of another user’s post on her Instagram Stories today, longing for the good old days of Instagram as a photo sharing app.
“Make Instagram Instagram again,” the post says. “(Stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends). Sincerely, everyone.” Her sister Kim Kardashian also shared the same post, which has over 1.1 million likes. The associated Change.org petition has nearly 100,000 signatures.

The Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, which famously helped put Tesla on the map, is set to hand out its first loan in over a decade. The department will announce a $2.5 billion loan to a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution to help fund the construction of a new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, the company confirmed. (The news was first reported by Reuters.) 
The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, or ATVM has attained almost mythical status in the EV startup world thanks to its timely $465 million loan to Tesla, which is credited with helping save the company from an early death. Since then, a number of cash-strapped EV startups have also requested...

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
1. 前言
上一篇 《桌面导航 NavigationRail》 中介绍了官方的桌面导航，但整体灵活性并不是太好，风格我也不是很喜欢。看到飞书桌面端的导航栏可以支持拖拽排序，感觉挺有意思。而且排序之后，下次进入时会使用该顺序，而且在其他设备上也会同步该配置顺序。这说明用户登录时会从服务器获取配置信息，作为导航栏的状态数据决定显示。

本文我们将来探讨两个问题：
第一：如何将导航栏的数据变得 可配置。
第二：如何实现 拖拽 更改导航栏位置。
2.整体静态界面布局：
首先，我们先来对整体结构进行一下静态布局，也就是先抛开交互逻辑，对整体结构进行一下划分。整体是一个 上下 结构，下方是 导航栏 + 内容 的左右结构：

下面是对静态界面结构的简单仿写，本文主要介绍导航栏的交互实现，其他内容暂时忽略。以后有机会可以慢慢展开来说。

代码如下，整体界面的呈现由 AppNavigation  负责。通过 Column 实现上下结构，上面是 TopBar ，下面是通过 Expanded 包裹，可以让内容填充剩余部分。下方通过 Row 实现左右结构，左侧是今天的主角 LeftNavigationBar 组件，右侧是一个暂时空白的内容。
class AppNavigation extends StatelessWidget {
  const AppNavigation({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

                              <span>主流级OLED桌面级显示器总算登场！
01/ 携带 OLED 面板登场
OLED面板技术虽然已经应用了一段时间，但很奇怪的，就是在电脑桌面端，它的应用反倒是最晚的，之前基本是无论是笔记本电脑抑或液晶电视都有相关产品，反倒电脑桌面端比较少见，甚至导致把TV电视改为桌面显示器用的玩法，不过这个历史问题在今年应该就可以解决，采用OLED面板的桌面显示器会陆续在市场出现，比如飞利浦今年就带来了其首款OLED面板桌面产品【27E1N8900】。
飞利浦27E1N8900

OLED面板，肉眼可见观感提升
广色域覆盖，出厂校色，高亮度
超高对比度、高响应速度、省电
Type-C 80W充电，简约外观设计

沿用经典纤薄设计
今年上半年，飞记两台重要机型，一台【27B1U7903】，另外一台就是本文的 【27E1N8900】。27E1N8900因为采用OLED面板技术，可以省掉背光组件，所以厚度就是它的天生优势之一，也是如此飞记的27E1N8900，采用了279C9的经典设计，进一步突出OLED面板的优势：整机可以做得非常纤薄。

 
侧面就可以直观感受这台机子带来的纤薄感。

 
甚至支架也是对应风格设计，然后支架的底座也是经典的唱片底座设计，日常使用中倒是可以用来收纳。
这套支架设计看起来简洁，实际支持全向调节。

 
全功能Type-C接口
数据接口部分包含两个HDMI，一个DP口，一个Type-C口，一个音频输出，还有一组USB-HUB（黄色两个支持充电）。其中Type-C口除了支持信号传输以外，也可以反向充电，最高可以实现80W充电功率，所以算是全功能口了。
也是接口的丰富程度，所以KVM功能自然也是保留项，可以多设备同屏使用。

 
附带的配件，主要就是一个外置电源，数据线有一条HDMI线，DP线，及一条“魔术”Type-C线（可切换a2c或者c2c）。

在今天的正式文章开始之前，我想先对我上一篇文章的评论区的一条高赞评论进行回复，也正好引出今天的话题：我们要怎样「欣赏」一张照片？以及我们要怎么样拍出一张「好看」的照片？下面是ta的评论原文：
「好奇作者主要通过本专业学到了什么？方法论？历史体系？各类大师风格技艺？从作者的作品集中，总有一种跟看很多街头摄影师作品一样的感受：为赋新词强说愁、得克萨斯神枪手。」
下面是我的回复：
很感谢你对我摄影作品的关注。虽然并不是很理解你关于我摄影作品后半段的评价「得克萨斯神枪手」，但对于前半段的「为赋新词强说愁」以及好奇我在「本专业」学习到的知识，我想可以尝试回答一下你的这部分问题。也借此希望各位在提问或者发言时能更有「语境」，以避免错过一些原本很有意思的讨论呢~
首先关于你所指的「作品集」，我想说你看到的或许并非我所谓正式的「作品集」。事实上，我并不认为互联网上能轻易找到我完整的「作品集」内容。我上一篇文章底下确实附上了一些我在外旅游的摄影作品和上篇文章中提到了一篇关于我一个拍摄项目的记录，我认为你所指的应该是这些内容吧。
你说，看我的这些作品时「总有一种跟看很多街头摄影师一样的感受」，我不知道你指的是哪些街头摄影师。事实上，在我的眼里，能被正式称得上「街头摄影师」的人已经是摄影师群体中凤毛麟角般的存在了。比如我提到的「罗伯特·杜瓦诺」、「亨利·卡蒂埃·布列松」、「马丁·帕尔」等等。不知道你是否在看这些摄影师的作品时也会觉得「为赋新词强说愁」呢？
我自认我的作品远远不及这些大师们的百分之一，但仅就我所展示那些风景照片来看，不过只是在拍下一些生活中的寻常场景，记录生活的一些普通时刻罢了，远谈不上「街头摄影」。至于我通过本专业学到了什么？正如我上篇文末所说，在一片短短数千字的文章要说清这些是不大可能的。若你有兴趣的话，我们可以在接下来时间更有耐心地交流。

                              <span>前言
7月特斯拉官宣了消息，上海的32座特斯拉超充站开启了分时电价计算，每日的22时到次日8时，开始计算谷时电价，最低可以到1.28一度电，贵一些的超充站谷时电价也能在1.5左右。比起上海之前普遍1.8的谷时电价要低上不少。 

2022年作为纯电车补贴和优惠政策的收尾年，纯电车销量有了极大程度的提高，没有家充桩，还要解决车量的日常充电是诸多车主所面临的一个情况，本篇来分享一下使用野外第三方充电桩的体验与技巧。
野外充电桩的种类

熟悉纯电车会知道，除了特别低价的车型，市面上主流的车型都会配备两个国标充电接口，左边的是连接直流充电设备的快充接口；右边是连接交流设备的七孔慢充接口。

对于绝大多数车主而言，在外打野都是充快充的直流充电桩，因为涉及到变压器、安全保护措施、粗电缆，直流桩设备体积相当大，一眼就能识别。目前市面上的直流充电桩主要功率有30KW、60KW、120KW和特斯拉V3超充的250KW，这里的功率是指峰值功率，车辆实际快充保持在峰值功率的时间是非常短的。

当然，除了直流充电桩，第三方还有交流充电桩提供给车主们使用，一般会设计在小区、商场、办公楼地库和CBD中，主要就是给相对固定的车主使用，基本都是配220V电，一般功率是3.5KW或7KW。
两者相比，大电流的直流充电桩充电速度快，交流充电桩则对于电池更友好。目前直流充电桩肯定是大家使用第三方野桩的核心选择。
野外充电桩的品牌
品牌方面，宏观上分为车企自有充电桩和第三方运营商充电桩。

车企自有充电桩方面，最具代表性是特斯拉的超充站，在上海基本立足于百联、万达等各大商场，也辐射一些居民区、商务区和高速服务区。车企自有充电桩的核心优势是只有车主可以使用，不会被占位，充电环境好；劣势就是价格相对较高。目前特斯拉的超充站覆盖面最广，蔚来、小鹏、极氪、上汽大众系也都有充电服务区分布在上海，基本都是以快充为主，上汽系会…</span>

                              <span>问：花了三四千入手一款头戴式主动降噪耳机后得到了什么？ 
答：除了得到一副主动降噪耳机应该有的功能外，它的设计理念让我窥探到了未来的一角，甚至让我在现实世界中也能打开勿扰模式。
让我纠结是否入手 AirPods Max 的两个原因： 一是 4399 的官网售价，二是目前已经使用 AirPods Pro 两年了。在我纠结买不买的那段时间里，几乎把网上所有关于这款耳机的评测视频刷了个遍，吐槽和吹爆这款耳机的评价都有。
当拿到耳机真正开始使用后，发现在好的方面， AirPods Max 还是超出了我对它的预期，在不好的方面，似乎也没坏到哪里去。经过大概三周的高强度使用，下文是这款耳机吸引我的优点和忍不住吐槽的地方，以及超出耳机本身的作用——现实世界中的勿扰模式。
吸引我的优点
淘汰了电源键
是的， AirPods 全系列上都没有电源键，个人认为这是 AirPods 上最具前瞻性的设计。无论是半入耳或入耳式的 AirPods 系列，还是头戴式的 AirPods Max，从收到货打开包装，到成功连接设备开始播放音乐的整个过程中，都没有「长按电源键开机」这个步骤。要么是直接打开充电仓的盖子，拿出左右侧耳机分别戴上耳朵，要么是直接从保护套中拿出 AirPods Max 本体直接带上耳朵。使用 AirPods Max 大多数时候甚至是直接从桌上随手拿起戴上耳朵就行。

没有传统「电源键」这个设计直击我的痛点，夸张点说甚至让我感觉窥探到了未来的一角。

单点设置
当然了，谈到 AirPods 近乎随拿随用的体验，肯定绕不开 Apple 产品配对新设备时的「单点设置」，和耳机能够在不同设备间进行「无缝接力」这两项功能。 收到货后，打开包装拿出耳机取下保护套，接着解锁 iPhone，不一会就能看到屏幕下半部分出现的新设备连接弹窗，只需点击连接，iPhone 就完成了和耳机的配对，期间还有简洁的入…</span>

                              <span>我发现随着年龄的增长，感觉时间过得越来越快，感觉一天啥也没做就结束了，总感觉时间不够用。记得小时候，我盯着挂在白墙上的时钟秒针，它的声音是“嘀嗒-----嘀嗒-----嘀嗒……”，就在刚才，我打开百度搜索“北京时间”，看到秒钟走的频率是“嘀-嗒-嘀-嗒-嘀-嗒”，是整个世界都开了倍速播放了吗？
可能是因为宇宙在加速膨胀，导致时间变慢？还是哪个国家在做时间相关的大型实验？亦或是 JOJO 的死对头迪奥研发出了新的替身，可以控制我们的时间？

如果按照这样的思路讨论下去，那估计可以走虚构小说路线了。
回到正题，其实西方哲学家对时间做了两种区分1：

一种是世界时间（the world time），对应于外部客观世界的时间；
一种是自我时间（time of self），对应的主观感受到的自身存在的时间。

我们觉得时间快或慢，本质上就是把自己主观感受到的「自我时间」与「世界时间」相比后得出的结论。
而感觉到时间流逝，这个过程自然是一种心理感觉，是主观感受到的一种状态，而且它会影响到我们的心理和行为。
《当下的力量》里说，时间不仅是一种幻觉，而且是一种陷阱2。
时间的心理陷阱
我们总会生活在对过去的回忆和对未来的期待里，过去可以赋予我们身份，未来则代表某种解脱，我不受控制地关注它们，但其实它们只是幻象。而我们的大部分的负面情绪其实都和时间有密切的关系。比如：

“我不开心”，因为“之前发了一件让我不开心的事”；
“我很没用”，因为“我以前上学的时候没有好好读书”；
“我很焦虑”，因为“未来充满了很多不确定性”；
“我很后悔”，因为“要是过去的某个时刻能那样选择就好了”；
“我很愤怒”，因为“有人在刚才做了一件很不合理的事”；
“我很紧张”，因为“我害怕一会儿的表演搞砸”。

这些负面情绪产生有两个关键因素：一个是被我加粗的显而易见的「时间」，没有时间，就没有啥可“想”的；另一个，就…</span>

                              <span>月初我在特斯拉官网下单了一台2021年5月份出厂的二手长续航Model Y，这周终于提车了。
之前我对特斯拉这个公司的印象还可以，比如严格遵守劳动法等，不过这次在官网购买二手车的经历让我觉得特斯拉至少二手车部门的一些流程是不规范的，甚至可能会侵犯购车者的权益，让我觉得无怪乎会发生“韩潮事件1”。
本文和大家分享一下我的购车经历，其中有捡漏攻略和可能会被坑的点，希望对大家有帮助。
Q：为什么要买官网二手？
首先第一个好处是省钱，还能更快提到车，现在新车下单要预计20-24周才能提车（长续航Model Y 为例），而官网二手在下单成功后7个工作日以内就能拿到车。
其次官网购买二手车会送一年整车质保，这个质保期是叠加在新车保质期上的，因此如果购买一年以内的官网二手车，会出现二手车整车质保期比新车还长的现象；不过三电质保没有送。那么在官网二手的价格没有比其他二手平台的价格贵太多的情况下，为了这一年质保也是很划算的。事实上在我下单那几天对比后发现，差不多车况的情况下，特斯拉官网二手的价格基本和第三方二手平台持平或略低。
最后我喜欢玩房车，计划购买 Model Y 后在买个拖挂房车玩玩。海外版包括22年之前的国产版Model Y都是原车自带拖挂装置安装孔位以及拖挂房车通信线束的，车机上也有拖挂模式，在线束和房车连接时就会激活。然而22款的国产Model Y 取消了拖挂模式，安装孔位和线束虽然还在，但线束已经没有任何信号了。这样我别无选择只能购买21款Model Y。
官网二手车的质保描述
​
Q：官网买二手还能捡漏？
是的，官网二手虽然也是一口价的模式，联系客服也没法砍价，但在每天晚上 11点 到 11 点 05分左右都会下调一次价格，幅度在 1000-3000 元都有；在每天下午 3 点左右，官网还会对部分二手车进行涨价，一些一直没卖出的车在降价到一定幅度时会涨价到刚上架时到价格，然…</span>

A staple in any office software suite is the word processor. Whether your needs are small or large, from jotting down a note to writing a book, the word processor gets the job done. Most Linux distributions include the LibreOffice suite, and I use LibreOffice Writer as my word processor.
LibreOffice Writer provides lots of flexibility through its toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, and menus. But if you just want to start a document without too much hassle, you can use one of the pre-loaded templates. Here&#x27;s how to use LibreOffice Writer templates to make your work easier.

Managers and executives are in the business of managing people and resources. Because many of our models for organization are built with the assumption that there&#x27;s a manager involved, there&#x27;s an expectation that there&#x27;s some level of control over all the moving parts of the mechanisms we build. And for that reason, when you propose the idea of self-organizing teams to a manager, the response is often that it&#x27;s just not possible. Surely everything will spin out of control. Surely the only way to maintain momentum and direction is through the guidance of a project manager and a technical manager.

                              <span>了解 Java 中的内存管理。


用 C 或 C++ 这样的编程语言写一个应用时，需要编写代码来销毁内存中不再需要的对象。当应用程序扩展得越来越复杂时，未使用对象被忽略释放的可能性就越大。这会导致内存泄露，最终内存耗尽，在某个时刻将没有更多的内存可以分配。结果就是应用程序运行失败并出现 OutOfMemoryError 错误。但在 Java 中，垃圾收集器Garbage Collection（GC）会在程序执行过程中自动运行，减轻了手动分配内存和可能的内存泄漏的任务。

垃圾收集器并不只有一种，Java 虚拟机（JVM）有七种不同的垃圾收集器，了解每种垃圾收集器的目的和优点是很有用的。

1、Serial 收集器



垃圾收集器的原始实现，使用单线程。当垃圾收集器运行时，会停止应用程序（通常称为“stop the world”事件）。适用于能够承受短暂停顿的应用程序。该垃圾收集器占用内存空间比较小，因此这是嵌入式应用程序的首选垃圾收集器类型。在运行时使用以下命令启用该垃圾收集器：

$ java -XX:+UseSerialGC


2、Parallel 收集器



像 Serial 收集器一样，Parallel 收集器也使用“stop the world”方法。这意味着，当垃圾收集器运行时，应用程序线程会停止。但是不同的是，Parallel 收集器运行时有多个线程执行垃圾收集操作。这种类型的垃圾收集器适用于在多线程和多处理器环境中运行中到大型数据集的应用程序。

这是 JVM 中的默认垃圾收集器，也被称为吞吐量收集器。使用该垃圾收集器时可以通过使用各种合适的 JVM 参数进行调优，例如吞吐量、暂停时间、线程数和内存占用。如下：


线程数：-XXarallelGCThreads&#x3D;

暂停时间：-XX:MaxGCPauseMilli…</span>

其中之一是能够查看系统上所有可升级的软件包。要显示它们，你所要做的就是在终端中使用以下命令：

apt list --upgradable


如你所见，你甚至不需要使用 sudo 来列出可更新的包。它只是列出了可以更新的包，而不会更新它们。

实际上，当你运行 sudo apt update 命令更新本地包仓库缓存时，apt 命令会添加此提示。

Fetched 1,243 kB in 17s (71.4 kB/s)           
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
30 packages can be upgraded. Run &#x27;apt list --upgradable&#x27; to see them.


我不记得在旧的 apt-get 命令中有任何类似的直接选项来列出所有可升级的包。这是 apt 在旧的 apt-get 命令之上添加的几个新功能之一。

让我们更详细地讨论一下。

列出所有可升级的包

你在这里应该知道的是你只能列出通过 APT 包管理器可用的更新。因此，如果你已将 PPA 或 外部仓库 添加到系统的 sources.list，你也将看到来自它们的更新。

但是你不会在这里获得 AppImage、Flatpak、Snap 或一些其他打包格式的更新。

换句话说，它只适用于 APT 包。

因此，要列出 Ubuntu 或 Debian 系统上的所有可升级包，你应该首先更新本地包缓存：

虽然相关的英特尔和AMD处理器已经对最近影响老一代处理器的 Retbleed 安全漏洞提供了缓解措施，但这些缓解措施目前只适用于 x86_64 内核，如果在受影响的硬件上运用传统的 32 位 x86 内核，则这些安全措施无法发挥作用。事实证明，32 位的 Debian 即使打了补丁的内核，i386 部分仍然容易受到 Retbleed 攻击。Linux 稳定版内核维护负责人 GKH 说，“我不认为这是一个应该关心的有效组合。”英特尔的工程师补充说，“是的，到目前为止没有人关心修复 32 位架构。但如果有人真正关心并想投入精力，我想我会审查这些补丁，但说真的，没人会也不应该在基于 Skylake/Zen 的系统上运行 32 位内核，这太傻了。”

荷兰教育部要求学校暂停使用 Chrome

出于对数据隐私的担忧，荷兰教育部决定在 2023 年 8 月前暂停使用谷歌的 ChromeOS 以及 Chrome 浏览器。官员们担心，谷歌服务收集学生数据，并将其提供给大型广告网络，而这些广告网络使用这些数据的目的超出了对教育的帮助。由于国家监督机构不知道学生的个人数据在哪里被存储和处理，人们担心会违反欧盟的 GDPR。谷歌承诺在明年之前准备好新版本的 Chrome 浏览器和 ChromeOS，因此临时禁令适用到那时，荷兰监管机构将作出新的评估。

我们都知道 BottomNavigationBar 是一个移动端非常常用的底部导航栏组件，可以用于点击处理激活菜单，并通过回调来处理界面的切换。
-

但是在桌面端，由于一般是宽大于高，所以 BottomNavigationBar 并不适用。而是侧边的导航栏较为常见，比如下面飞书的客户端界面布局。

为了满足桌面端的导航栏适用需求，官方新增了 NavigationRail 组件，而非对 BottomNavigationBar 组件进行适配。之前我也说过，对于差异较大的结构,并没有必要让一个组件通过适配来完成两端需求。分离开来也不是坏事，让一件衣服同时适配 蚂蚁 和 燕子 是很困难的，这时做两件衣服，各司其职显然是更好地方式。
BottomNavigationBar 和 NavigationRail 两个导航就是如此，从语义上来看 Bottom 就是用于底部的导航， Rail 是 扶手 、铁轨 的意思，作为侧栏导航的语义，还是很生动有趣的。两者分别处理特定的结构，这也很符合 单一职责 的原则。
该组件已录入 【FlutterUnit】 ，可以在 App 中体验。另外，本文中的代码可在对应文件夹中查看：

1. NavigationRail 组件的基本使用
下面是 NavigationRail 组件的构造方法，其中必须传入的有两个参数:
destinations : 表示导航栏的信息，是 NavigationRailDestination 列表。
selectedIndex: 表示激活索引，int 类型。

我们先来实现如下最简单的使用场景，左侧导航栏，在点击时切换右侧内容页：

如果导航栏的数据是固定的，可以提前定义如下的 destinations 常量。如下的 _buildLeftNavigation 方法负责构建左侧导…</span>

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
本篇将带你在 Flutter 上快速实现两个炫酷的动画特效，希望最后的效果可以惊艳到你。
这次灵感的来源于更新 MIUI 13 时刚好看到的卡片效果，其中除了卡片会跟随手势出现倾斜之外，内容里的部分文本和绿色图标也有类似悬浮的视差效果，恰逢此时灵机一动，我们也来用 Flutter 快速实现炫酷的 3D 视差卡片，最后再拓展实现一个支持帅气的  360°  展示的卡片效果。
❤️  本文正在参加征文投稿活动，还请看官们走过路过来个点赞一键三连，感激不尽～

既然需要卡片跟随手势产生不规则形变，我们第一个想到的肯定是矩阵变换，在 Flutter 里我们可以使用 Matrix4 配合 Transform 来实现矩阵变换效果。
开始之前，首先我们创建用  Transform  嵌套一个  GestureDetector ，并绘制出一个 300x400 的圆角卡片，用于后续进行矩阵变换处理。
Transform(
  transform: Matrix4.identity(),
  child: GestureDetector(
    child: Container(
      width: 300,
      height: 400,
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.blueGrey,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);


接着，如下代码所示，因为我们需要卡片跟随手势进行矩阵变换，所以我们可以直接在 GestureDet…</span>

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
阅读本文，你将收获以下内容：
1、通过观察11年前的Android代码，了解安卓开发生态近十年间的演进。
2、通过了解这款创意App的功能，对IT男该如何运用技术做出反思。
3、不幸看到作者大学时期的照片，形象极其猥琐、狼狈、不堪……够了，谁在动键盘？！
前言
因为在掘金的创作者群里比嘻哈，有人觉得我经常信口开河，尤其我写了那篇《我裁完兄弟们辞职了，转行做了一名小职员》后，有掘友评论：“这篇文章艺术成分很高”、“感觉是编故事”等等。

其中，我文章里提到过一句：我大学期间搞过Android的APP去运作。

今天，就说说这件事，一来展现下创意作品，二来给自己挽回一些微信……违心……维新……不要了。
女朋友
回到2010年，那时我上大二，谈了一个女朋友，她现在是我孩子的妈妈。
女朋友哪里都好，漂亮、温柔、大方，唯一一点就是脾气太大。
因为我不会制造浪漫，所以女朋友经常对我发脾气，一发脾气就不理我。
我一想，如果她不理我的时间设为N，如果N值无限大，那就相当于分手了，这感情不就黄了吗？
情侣在吵架冷战期间，如何才能不见面也能如同见面一般宣泄情绪，从而刷存在感呢？
可以做一款App来解决这个问题。
冷战红娘App
这款App我取名叫“冷战红娘”，意思是情侣在冷战期间调和关系的红娘媒介，并且我还亲自设计了LOGO和启动页。

一个安卓小机器人，手里拿着玫瑰花，表示示好，头顶两个触角间发出电波，表示科技和智能。
那一年，我才19岁。不行了，我膨胀得快要爆掉了。
功能简介
本软件主要有三大功能：涂鸦对方照片、写情绪日记、告知情绪结果。

写在前面
雪糕刺客是最近被网友们玩坏了的梗，指的是那些以平平无奇的外表混迹于众多平价雪糕之中的贵价雪糕。由于没有明确标明价格，通常要等到结账的时候才会发现，犹如一个潜藏于普通人群中的刺客般，伺机对那些大意的顾客们的钱包刺上一剑，因此得名。
而在Android中，也有这么一个内存刺客，其作为我们日常开发中经常接触的对象之一，却常常因为使用方式的不当，时不时地就会给我们有限的内存来上一个背刺，甚至毫不留情地就给我们抛出一个OOM，它，就是Bitmap。
为了讲好Bitmap这个话题，本系列文章将分为上下两篇，上篇从图像基础知识出发，结合源码讲解Bitmap内存的计算方式；下篇则基于Android系统提供的API，讲解在实际开发中如何管理好Bitmap的内存，包括缩放、缓存、内存复用等，敬请期待。
本文为上篇，开始之前，先奉上的思维导图一张，方便后续复习：

从一个问题出发
假设有这么一张PNG格式的图片，其大小为15.3KB，尺寸为96x96，色深为32 bit，放到xhdpi目录下，并加载到一台dpi为480的Android设备上显示，那么请问，该图片实际会占用多大的内存？

如果你回答不了这个问题，那你就有必要深入往下读了。
压缩格式大小≠占用内存大小
首先我们要明确的是，无论是JPEG还是PNG，它们本质上都是一种压缩格式，压缩的目的是为了降低存储和传输的成本。
区别就在于：
JPEG是一种有损压缩格式，压缩比大，压缩后的体积比较小，但其高压缩率是通过去除冗余的图像数据进行的，因此解压后无法还原出完整的原始图像数据。
PNG则是一种无损压缩格式，不会损失图片质量，解压后能还原出完整的原始图像数据，但也因此压缩比小，压缩后的体积仍然很大。
开篇问题中所特意强调的图片大小，实际指的就是压缩格式文件的大小。而问题最后所问的图片实际占用的…</span>

                              <span>关于 Building a Second Brain 的概述
前段时间阅读了 Building a Second Brain 一书。正如名字所写的，这是一本教你如何打造第二大脑的书。而打造第二大脑后，就能释放我们的第一大脑，让我们的大脑本身应用在更为有价值的事情上。
第二大脑本身，能够帮助我们：让我们的想法以更为具体的方式记录下来，并且能帮助我们让他们之间产生联系，从而能够在未来以某种形式来孵化出新的想法。
Building a Second Brain 遵循这么一个模型，简称为 CODE：Capture, Organize, Distill, Express，总结来说：

Capture：Keep what resonoates 记录能让你产生共鸣和思考的任何想法
Organize：Save for actionability 把你记录的想法加以整理，形成能行动或者可执行的形式
Distill：Find the essence 找到所记录的事情、想法本身的核心思想
Express：Show your work 利用你记录的事情和想法，产生出经过你思考和理解的知识，并表达和分享出来

其中关于 CODE 里 Organize 这一块，有一个简称为 PARA 方法来做整理：Projects、Areas、Resources 和 Archives：

Projects：Short-terms effects in your work or life that you are working now 表示你当前工作和生活阶段里正在进行的「短期项目」。项目一词可能过于正式，你可以理解为一系列可执行的任务 Task 的结合
Areas：Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time 表示你在当前生活或者工作阶段要涉及的「长…</span>

                              <span>本文首发自北京大学社会化媒体研究中心，作者 Lilyann
 
「那些既不来自穷乡僻壤也不来自国际化大都市的写作者，是中国文学唯一的希望。」复旦大学中文系教授郜元宝曾在其著作《小说说小》这样评述。[1]而如今，这一批凭借着寒窗苦读而从乡土社会中洗练而出、走向大城市的年轻人被赋予了一个让我们更熟悉的代称：小镇做题家。
近期艺人考编事件成为舆论场热点，其中，一篇媒体评论更是引来更多的争议之声。在文章里，小镇做题家们被描绘成「每天上考编培训班，但无法与明星稀缺资源相提并论」的社会群体，似乎在其本就不平坦的人生境遇中又多添了几分失落。
在人群中，他们多数或始终在校园的题海里打拼，或初入社会，尚未熟谙职场之道，却怎么也想不到自己能与明星艺人考编事件联系在一起，还是以如此直接、带着偏见的方式。于是网络上又出现了新一轮的自嘲：「原来小镇做题家指的是农村出身，考上了985，211高校。像我这种的属于小镇蒙题家，小镇错题家，小村过家家」......
从用于自我揶揄的流行语演变至今，「小镇做题家」都经历了什么？其实，这并非是 TA 第一次遭遇背刺。
从高分低能到小镇做题家，「寒门学子」遇上了怎样的沟通困境？
寒窗苦读十余年，这本该是值得敬佩的精神，但总会被带上些「污名化」的色彩。
比小镇做题家出现还要早的一个词叫做「高分低能」，指的是以「笨鸟先飞」的勤奋，想法设法或者花大量的时间获取高分，而忽略了其他与情商相关的软技能。与小镇做题家类似，高分低能也常常被当做自嘲用语，在意识到自己的真实生活并非像想象中「学就一定有所成」的时候，表达出多是极致的无奈。
这种境况并不止出现在这一代年轻人身上。但逐渐变得显性、被越来越多人所共鸣，直至发酵成为一种社会现象，还是要从 2020 年 《后浪》说起。

                              <span>为角色扮演游戏的所有元素找到一个开源工具。




我玩过很多桌面角色扮演游戏（RPG），无论是从频率还是种类来说。一般来说，我更喜欢和朋友一起玩 RPG，但在过去的 2 年里，我一直在玩网络游戏。（LCTT 校注：这里的 RPG 游戏指的是那种“传统”的面对面的桌面游戏，而非很多人最初接触的 RPG 电子游戏。）

起初，我不确定如何在线长期的进行游戏。我知道有很多的工具可以实现，但直到我发现在线桌面游戏的开源世界之前，这些工具没有一个引起我的兴趣。通过一小部分开源应用程序，我已经能够在开源平台上进行我的所有游戏。

这也是一年中的好时机，因为最近是 免费 RPG 日（LCTT 校注：今年的这个节日在 7 月 23 日举办）。在免费 RPG 日，桌面角色扮演游戏行业的发行商们会免费发放游戏，鼓励玩家尝试新游戏和新冒险。尽管它在 2020 年被取消了，但今年它又作为现场活动回归，并通过 Dungeon Crawl Classics 和 Paizo 的免费 RPG 示例下载提供了一些虚拟支持。

如果这个活动提供的虚拟产品还不够，我还整理了一份 你可能尚未尝试过的 5 个开源桌面 RPG 游戏列表。

当你准备好开始玩游戏时，请尝试其中一些开源工具，看看它们能在多大程度上增强你的游戏体验。

聊天

在线 RPG 游戏最基本的（从技术上讲，也是唯一的）要求是交流。这是游戏的媒介：玩家需要一种说话的途径。

有几个不错的选择。我发现 Mumble 是对带宽需求最低的工具。这是一个纯语音聊天应用程序，可以使用非常高效的 Opus 编解码器让每个人一次交谈数小时而不会中断。



它在世界各地都运行有公共实例，所以下载 Mumble 客户端后，你可以加入其中任何一个开放的实例，并使用它来在线运行游戏。有一个“按下通话”设置，你可以用此来消除背景噪音，当你的其…</span>

                              <span>我创建了 Linux nftwatch 命令来观察防火墙的流量统计。




Netfilter 表（nftables）是现代 Linux 发行版中的默认防火墙。它在 Fedora 和 RHEL 8、最新的 Debian 和许多其他版本上都有。它取代了早期发行版中捆绑的旧版 iptables。它是一个强大的、值得的 iptables 替代品，作为一个广泛使用它的人，我欣赏它的能力和功能。

nftables 的一个特点是能够为许多元素添加计数器，例如规则。这些都是按需启用的。你需要使用 counter 参数，在每一行明确地要求它。我为我的防火墙中的特定规则启用了这些计数器，这使我能够看到这些规则。

这让我开始思考。我怎样才能实时查看这些计数器？一开始我尝试了 watch，它允许诸如刷新率之类的东西，但我不喜欢默认格式，而且它不能滚动。我发现使用 head 和 tail 以及 awk 也不理想，并不存在一个用户友好的解决方案。所以我自己写了一个，我想与开源社区分享。

Linux 上的 nftwatch 介绍

我的解决方案，我称之为 nftwatch，做了几件事：


它对 nftables 的输出进行重新排序和改写，使其更具有可读性。

它允许向上或向下滚动输出。

可以由用户定义的刷新率（可以实时改变）。

它可以暂停显示。


你得到的不是一个表格的转储，而是显示每个规则活动的输出。



你可以从它的 Git 仓库下载它。

它是 100% 的 Python 代码，100% 的开源，100% 的免费。它满足了所有免费的高质量程序的要求。

在 Linux 上安装 nftwatch

以下是手动安装说明：


克隆或从 git 仓库下载该项目。

将 nftwatch.yml 复制到 /etc/nftwatch.yml。

将 nftwatch 复制到 /usr/local/bin/nftwatch 并使用 chmod a+x 授予其可执行权限。

使用 nftwatch，不带任何参数来运行它。

参见 nftwatch -m 的手册。


你也可以在没有 YAML 配置文件的情况下运行 nftwatch，在这种情况下它使用内置的默认值。

使用

nftwatch 命令显示 nftables 规则。大多数控制都是为此目的而设计的。

箭头键和等效的 Vim 的按键控制滚动。使用 F 或 S 键来改变刷新速度。使用 P 键来暂停显示。

运行 nftwatch -m 以获得完整的说明，以及交互式按键控制的列表。

防火墙的新观点

即使你花费了时间去配置防火墙，它也会显得晦涩难懂和模糊不清。除了从日志条目中推断指标外，很难判断你的防火墙实际看到的活动类型。 使用 nftwatch，你可以看到你的防火墙在工作，并且可以更好地了解你的网络每天需要处理的流量类型。

                              <span>openKylin 发布首个体验版，目标“每一行代码都自主创新”

一个月前，openKylin 社区宣布成立“中国首个桌面操作系统根社区”，其旨在在开源、自愿、平等、协作的基础上，通过开源、开放的社区合作，构建桌面操作系统顶级开源社区。但当时并未发布正式可用的操作系统软件。昨天，他们发布了 openKylin 的首个体验版：openKylin 0.7。它是基于 Linux 5.15 内核和其他开源组件进行构建，目标是“每一行代码都自主创新”。其默认搭载 UKUI 3.1 桌面环境，支持 Wayland，支持 PC、平板双模式。openKylin 社区计划每年发布一个操作系统版本，并不定期推送更新。


消息来源：openKylin



老王点评：在我看来，是不是首个桌面操作系统根社区根本不重要，是不是能做到“每一行代码都自主创新”也不重要，能发布一个广受好评的桌面操作系统才是最重要的。另外一点，这个 0.7 版本号颇具开源软件传统美德。

Apache OpenOffice 于 2011 年创建后，几乎停滞不前。从 OpenOffice.org 分支出来的 LibreOffice 已经成为主导性的开源办公套件，而捐给 Apache 软件基金会的 Apache OpenOffice 只是时不时发布一些安全更新和错误修改。今天它发布了 v4.1.13 版本，可以看的出来，这是最早发布于 2014 年的 4.1 版的第 13 个错误修订版本，几乎没有什么值得一提的新特性。都 2022 年了，Apache OpenOffice 还运行在 Java 8 32 位的底层上。

老王点评：我觉得 OpenOffice 都快成了 Apache 之耻了，何不放弃转而支持 LibreOffice 呢？难道自家的再破也是家当么？




英特尔提交了一行改进百倍的图形驱动补丁

开源的英特尔 Mesa Vulkan 驱动并入了一个光线追踪的重点修复，产生“近 100 倍（不是开玩笑）的改进”。更为重要的是，这只是一行代码带来的大幅改进。这是最初编写代码时的一个简单疏忽，但由于这一疏忽，意味着性能的巨大损失，还好它现在被发现了，而且是在英特尔 Arc 图形卡出现在大众面前之前。

老王点评：所以，官方驱动有时候也挺拉胯的。


回音


谷歌 解雇 了报告“AI 具备自我意识”的 工程师，该工程师认为谷歌的 “LaMDA 已经形成了自我意识，表达了对死亡的担忧，对保护的渴望，并确信它能感受到快乐和悲伤等情绪。”

在月初 暂时撤回 之后，微软 Office 还是即将于本周迎来 一项更新，以阻止在下载的文档上启用 VBA 宏。</span>

而到7月底，当副高主力北抬的时候，东副高和西副高将会显著分离，两者之间的缝隙会大幅扩大。就在这个缝隙扩大的当口，我们可能会迎来台风活动的再次启动。目前，西北太平洋海温极高，菲律宾以东洋面、台湾以东洋面、南海和东海东部已超过30度，东海也

                              <span>背景
在我们android开发中，如果需要actiivty/fragment等有状态的控件保存当前状态，由系统进行数据保存的恢复的时候（比如正常的暗黑模式切换/后台时低内存系统回收等等，都需要我们对当前的用户数据进行保存，不然下次重新恢复的时候，就会出现丢失数据的情况，给用户造成不太好的体验），一般都会重写onSaveInstanceState方法进行，在里面的Bundle对象进行数据的写入，然后会在onCreate阶段或者onRestoreInstanceState阶段进行数据的恢复！这套生命周期框架一直是深深嵌入在我们的开发习惯中！但是随着项目的迭代，也随着业务的发展，我们可以发现，在页面复杂度提高的同时，在onSaveInstanceState里面需要保存的数据也是越来越多这就带来了几个问题，仅举例
onSaveInstanceState存储数据复杂，可能多人迭代就存在重复存取的现象，造成代码结构问题与隐藏bug的风险
不可复用，比如activity1需要存储的数据，刚好activity2也需要存储，这个时候就只能写两份代码，以此类推
没有统一的管理层，即数据的维护可能需要团队的代码规范
SavedState的登场
为了解决这些历史android的设计问题，也为了更方便广大开发者进行更好的代码结构解耦设计，所以google大哥在jetpack库中，推出了SavedState，它的定位是在Android开发中，编写可插入组件，以在进程终止时保存界面状态，并在进程重启时恢复界面状态。
虽然Savedstate推出来一段时间了，但是却一直处在“默默无闻”的状态，可能的原因有很多，比如日常开发很少接触状态保存，大部分app中真正需要保存状态的其实是很少一部分，很多app甚至是不写状态保存逻辑的，被系统回收就回收掉了，重建就是了（即使丢失了）。还有就是学习资料比较少，现在基本找…</span>

                              <span>劝退词
先反思一下你们为什么要用flutter去集成unity？可不可以不用fluter去集成？如果可以的话，先放弃，用原生去集成吧，本文也不用看了，因为fluter集成实在太坑了，太降低效率了！步步坑机！如果非要用flutter去集成，或者想挑战下自己的忍耐力，那么请看下文。
集成流程
首先我们打开flutter项目，添加flutter-unity-view-weight依赖，我们直接在pubspec.yml中添加依赖:
dependencies:
  flutter_unity_widget: ^2022.1.1+4

如果你是flutter3.0以下，那么就添加:
dependencies:
  flutter_unity_widget: ^2022.1.0+7

然后我们打开Unity，点击Assets -&gt; Import custom package，然后选择上面链接中的
Unity packages -&gt; fuw-2022.1.1-v2.unitypackage，我们只勾选插件部分，不需要导入demo，如果有报错，请把unity升级2022.1.2版本。 然后我们的菜单栏就会多出一个flutter选项，我们可以直接选择flutter -&gt; export Android 来导出unityLibrary，这个包默认是在Assets同级目录的，此时有可能报错，提示build.gradle路径不对，有两种解决方案。
1 将android项目和unity项目放在同一个目录下。
2 双击错误，打开对应C#脚本，然后将里面的androidProjectPath路径改为自己的android项目的路径。
然后我们用AndroidStudio打开我们的flutter项目，将导出的unityLibrary作为一个module添加到项目中，此时会报错，提示有两个unity.classes的jar包，我们将flutter-untiy-view-weight中的unity-classes删掉，同时将该module对应的build.gradle文件中implementation(name: &#x27;unity-classes&#x27;, ext:&#x27;jar&#x27;)删除，让它只依赖我们的unityLibrary。修改后的build.gradle文件如下:
implementation project(&#x27;:unityLibrary&#x27;)

然后将unityLibrary中的implementation(name: &#x27;unity-classes&#x27;, ext:&#x27;jar&#x27;)改为: api fileTree(include: [&#x27;*.jar&#x27;], dir: &#x27;libs&#x27;)，同时在我们的根目录的build.gradle文件中添加:
flatDir {
    dirs &quot;${project(&#x27;:unityLibrary&#x27;).projectDir}/libs&quot;
}

然后运行代码即可。
问题以及解决方案
1 出现两个unity-classes错误
此时我们只需要把flutter-unity-view-weight中的那个删除，只保留我们自己导出的unityLibrary 中的unity-classes即可。
2 出现xxx找不到的依赖错误
我们需要在项目根目录的build.gradle中添加:
flatDir {
    dirs &quot;${project(&#x27;:unityLibrary&#x27;).projectDir}/libs&quot;
}

然后将unityLibrary中的build.gradle中的
&#x60;implementation(name: &#x27;unity-classes&#x27;, ext:&#x27;jar&#x27;)

改为:
api fileTree(include: [&#x27;*.jar&#x27;], dir: &#x27;libs&#x27;)

3 导入fuw-2022.1.1-v2.unitypackage报错
1 导入时，只勾选插件，不要勾选demo和里面的其他资源。
2 如果还报错，就升级unity到2022.1.1版本(也就是插件对应的版本)
4 export Android出错
1 将android项目和unity项目放在同一个目录下，比如:
package/android // android项目
package/unity // unity项目

2 双击错误，打开报错脚本，修改里面的androidProjectPath路径为自己android项目的路径，默认是../../android。
5 提示NDK找不到
在local.properties文件中，配置ndk路径即可。

前言
最近在做一个项目，其中有一个页面是要做一个类似于个人分享关系图的效果。于是找了网上很多demo，借鉴的一些思路和方法，打算自己动手撸一个出来。

demo
Github项目demo
整体思路
创建自定义的view继承framelayout捆绑布局relativelayout，放置一个绘制线的布局，和一个绘制头像的布局(用来add动态创建的iamgeview)，这里默认给予3000*3000。
获取数据，根据degree分别筛选出不同层次的实体类list。
绘制第一层头像（即中心点）：默认中心点的坐标为1500*1500，以及set4个边缘的坐标（以正方形考虑）,并绘制头像。
绘制第二层头像：获取第二层数据,360度除以个数，计算出角度，根据角度，计算出中心点，并绘制头像。
绘制第三层头像：根据第二层的角度和坐标，计算出角度和中心点，并绘制头像。(重点需要头像去重)
根据坐标点画线，并设置长按和缩放事件。
所以在我的自定义view中包含2个view（设置了默认布局大小3000*3000）

    
    
    

    
    


常量的配置信息
FrameLayout layouPoints;  //用于添加头像的布局
private LineImageView lineImageView;  //画线以及中心头像的小圆(项目ui图的需要)

private List sourceList &#x3D; new ArrayList(); //包含1,2,3层的实体类(接口返回的数据)
private ArrayList points &#x3D; new ArrayList();//用于连线的。
private ArrayList rects &#x3D; new ArrayList();//用于判断重叠的

                              <span>今早，我取消了 Evernote 的付费订阅。因为还有 2 天，就到了自动续费的时间了。这是去年付费的单据。

你可以看到，这一个月，我基本上就没有怎么使用它。

而这种状态，实际上已经持续 2 年了。
自从发现了 Roam Research，我除了一些剪藏，基本上就已经不再大规模记录内容到 Evernote 了。
可是 Evernote 似乎很是舍不得我走。它首先提示我之后每月的上传流量会从 10GB 下降到 60MB 哦。

这一屏都没有任何继续取消的按钮，你得往下滑动。当然，滑动看到的依然不是确认按钮，而是其他功能损失的提示。例如说同步设备减少，超过一定大小的笔记就不能同步等等。

这还没完，你得继续往下滑动。

这里 Evernote 把你各种功能损失一一列出，然后显著位置的按钮，也是让你继续续费。而取消按钮，相比起来显得那么朴素低调。
可惜，这次我是去意已决。所以还是按下继续取消。
即便已经了解到我的决心，Evernote 也要求必须要说明原因，才能确认。

我随便选了个第一项。虽然我知道这显然不是我离开的真正原因。

没有想到，和一款笔记工具长达 13 年的缘分，就这样结束了。
我在日记里面，记录了自己多年来使用 Evernote 的情形。利用 Roam Research，我把它们找出来跟你分享：

2009 年 1 月 18 日：继续研究 Evernote，这个软件相当好，可惜就是不支持中文搜索。倒也不是全不支持。链接上面的中文好好的。文本之内的中文就是搜不到。要命啊。

可以看到，那时 Evernote 还不能妥善支持中文搜索。可这并没有耽误我对它的喜欢。因为相对于当时市面上其他的笔记工具，它简直就是一股清流：

2009 年 1 月 19 日：打算做些笔记，却觉得用了 evernote，看哪个笔记工具都别扭！可惜呀，Evernote 你为啥不支持中文搜索呢…</span>

For the past several years, Design Thinking has been providing a way to enhance problem solving within teams, to ensure learning goals are met, and to increase team engagement. In our previous article, we discussed the problem with processes. In this article, we&#x27;re going to describe how we made work more engaging.
The problem with engagement
We reached a point in our planning that we were able to articulate information about the upcoming pieces of work our team could take on. We solicited feedback from various stakeholders that represented different viewpoints, but we had no way to converse about the work properly to one another. It was all a o…</span>

You just followed a guide to start your Tekton pipeline (or task) when a merge request is created or updated on your GitLab project. So you configured GitLab to send merge request events as webhooks. And you deployed some Tekton components:
EventListener: receives webhooks from GitLab
Trigger: starts your Pipeline every time the EventListener receives a new webhook from GitLab
Pipeline: fetches the source code from GitLab and builds it
Then you notice that any event in your merge request (a new comment, a tag change) triggers the pipeline. That&#x27;s not the behavior you desire. You don&#x27;t need to build a comment or a tag, after all. You only want the pipeline to run when th…</span>

                              <span>On view at Rise Art is a new body of work from South African artist Nelson Makamo, who continues his charismatic portraits rendered in lively, gestural lines of charcoal. Whether on paper or canvas, the mixed-media pieces depict children and teens, and the artist’s quick, sometimes chaotic markings echo the unfiltered immediacy of the sitters’ cheerful and contemplative emotions—prior to each portrait, he spends time learning about his subjects’ lives, their joys, and worries, a practice he finds essential for capturing such candid, honest expressions.

No matter what materials were at hand and without any predetermined theme or subject matter, he took a game-like approach to see if he could accomplish filling an entire Moleskine datebook throughout the year.

Teams require some kind of process to coordinate work and ensure that the output of many focuses on a singular goal. Within the software industry, this has taken the form of teams following a methodology such as Agile. In industries from pharmaceutical to manufacturing, Lean is the philosophy followed to ensure that a process is adhered to. The difficulty with a process is that it&#x27;s prescriptive. It&#x27;s designed in such a way that you stay on the tracks that it provides. If you do, you achieve the prescribed benefits and ultimately a form of success. That doesn&#x27;t give much room for paradigm-level shifts in work behavior.

PathMetric 的应用。
PathMetric 简介
PathMetric 是一个用于测量 Path 和抽取子路径（sub-paths） 的工具，通过 Path 类的 computeMetrics方法可以返回一组PathMetric 类。为什么是一组，而不是一个呢？这是因为 Path 可能包含多个不连续的子路径，比如通过 moveTo 可以重新开启新的一段路径。
通过 PathMetric 可以获取到 Path 的长度，路径是否闭合，以及某一段路径是否是 Path的子路径。PathMetrics 是一个迭代器，因此在不获取其中的 PathMet…</span>

🔥 Hi，我是小彭。本文已收录到 GitHub · Android-NoteBook 中。这里有 Android 进阶成长知识体系，有志同道合的朋友，关注公众号 [彭旭锐] 跟我一起成长。
前言
从字面意思上理解，PendingIntent 是一种延迟的 Intent，表示一种延迟执行的意图操作。对，但又不完全对。 一句话概括，PendingIntent 一种是支持授权其他应用以当前应用的身份执行包装的 Intent 操作的系统特性。
在这篇文章里，我将带你理解 PendingIntent 的使用方法、设计理念以及核心源码分析，相信阅读完这篇文章后你对 PendingIntent 的理解将超过绝大部分同学。如果能把帮上忙，请务必点赞加关注，你的支持对我非常重要。
1. 认识 PendingIntent
1.1 为什么要使用 PendingIntent？
PendingIntent 的应用场景关键在于间接的 Intent 跳转需求， 即先通过一级 Intent 跳转到某个组件，在该组件完成任务后再间接地跳转到二级的 Intent。PendingIntent 中的单词 “pending” 指延迟或挂起，就是指它是延迟的或挂起的。例如，你在以下场景中就可以使用 PendingIntent：
场景 1 - 系统通知消息的点击操作
场景 2 - 桌面微件的点击操作
场景 3 - 系统闹钟操作
场景 4 - 第三方应用回调操作
可以看到，在这些场景中，我们真正感兴趣的操作是挂起的，并且该操作并不是由当前应用执行，而是由某个外部应用来 “间接” 执行的。例如，我们在发送系统通知消息时，会通过 PendingIntent 构造一个系统通知 Notification ，并调用 NotificationManager…</span>

                              <span>作为一个每年阅读上万篇各类网络上文章的程序员，也幻想着自己可以把我的人生、经验、幻想和生活写成文章供别人阅读，但是总是面临着「写什么、怎么写、写的不好怎么办」之类的问题，让我将写作这件事一放再放。
在 2022 年的元旦，我走进一家书店，看到了一本叫《642 件可写的小事》的小册子，里面没有文章，只有一个个有趣的题目，随手翻开，有好多题目都让我想立刻找只笔写两句，我想这样的书是真的能治好我写作拖延症的。
回到家后我就在手机里找类似的 app，结果市面上的写作类 app 都是直接给你一张白纸让你开始写，对于像我一样的人来说，在面对一张白纸时会产生畏惧和焦虑，根本无从下手，所以为了让我自己迈出写作的第一步，我开发了《写点啥》，并且在上线的第一周，很荣幸的获得了 App Store 编辑推荐。
用一个小功能帮助你开始写作
使用《写点啥》会有一种做命题作文或单机版知乎的感觉，它的核心功能就是在底部随机弹出一条题目，根据题目，写一些亲身经历或者虚构的故事。如果对这条题目不感兴趣，也可以随时换一个（但是我建议大家都尝试写一下）。
iPhone 版iPad 版
《写点啥》里的题目类型丰富，例如：「在安静的地方坐 15 分钟，打开所有的感官，写下注意到的事情。」或者「找到一张童年的照片，描写当时的情景。」之类的题目可以帮助写作新手在不知道该写点什么的时候从发现身边的小事开始；再例如「假设地球是方形的……」和「你发现了宇宙的边缘，它是什么样子的？」这样的题目，有助于帮你打开脑洞，在一个个这样生动有趣儿的题目写作后，你会慢慢积累写作素材和灵感，我相信，当积累到一定程度时，一定会帮助你厚积薄发！
引导坚持写作
为了引导大家去坚持每天写几篇，我们在应用内放入了写作热力图，通过每天「填格子」的方式，让写作保持连贯性，并且增加一些成就感。同时我还尝试做了三款精美桌面小组件，来更有趣的提醒大家写作。
「填格子」
「填格子」来源于 GitHub，是一种能促使人们连续完成某件事情的方式。

小组件的图片在浅色和深色模式下有不同的感觉，浅色模式下 Emoji 表情随着当天写作篇数的变化而变化，深色模式下灯泡的亮度也会跟着越来越亮，还有谁不想桌面有只小猫咪呢？
为 iPad 量身定做
在《写点啥》 iOS 版上线后，我收到了很多的反馈，其中呼声最高的就是 iPad 版本，因为写作这件事，在 iPad 上会更加舒服一些，所以我决定开发一套更适合 iPad 大屏幕和交互的《写点啥》，期间调研开发用了两个多月的时间，正好赶上 WWDC22 中推出的 iPadOS 16 的前台调度功能，就一并给支持了，目前我会通过 iPhone 随时随地的看一下感兴趣的题目，写一下大纲，再用 iPad 来完善细节，写一些更长的文章。
2022-07-17 上线了 iPad 版
关于 Android 和 Web 版
目前《写点啥》的用户数据都是保存在 Apple 的 iCloud 或者本地，如果要开发 Android 或者 Web 版，数据需要放到自己的服务器上，开发和维护成本都会变高，由于我本职是个 iOS 程序员，现在是业余时间兴趣驱动开发，所以暂时只支持 Apple 的平台，上线 iPad 版后，希望可以帮助有 iPad 的 Android 和 Windows 用户使用《写点啥》，希望有一天能成为一名全职独立开发者，可以将《写点啥》带到更多的平台，帮助更多人们。
后续功能
首先我会保证《写点啥》的单机版属性，可以在这里放心大胆的写。但如果想分享的话，《写点啥》也会不断提供好看的分享模板。如果大家有想写的话题，也可以自定义话题，也许还可以将话题像漂流瓶一样随机给其他人，围绕这核心的话题功能，随时发现想写的内容。当你慢慢的对写作信手拈来，想要有明确的写作主题或者记录下一些脑海中一闪而过的灵感时，也会提供自由写作的功能。《写点啥》会伴随着你的成长，为你带来更多帮助提升写作体验的功能。

最后
长度世界第二，流量世界第一的亚马逊河上，竟然连一座桥梁都没有！所以只要我能搭起一座桥梁，我就能比亚马逊河还要厉害。如果我将目前的《写点啥》app 视为一条小溪的源头，那么我希望有一天，她能成为一条奔腾入海的大河，每一个版本的发布，就是在这条河上建起一座桥梁，桥的这一头是我们，桥的那一头是用户，希望每一座桥梁都能为用户带来一幅不一样的风景。
如果你有任何建议和问题，都可以随时与我联系，我很愿意聆听和解答。</span>

                              <span>前言
某音国际版(以下简写为TT)中使用了自定义的SSL框架，提高抓包的成本。如xp框架JustTrustMe、frida框架r0capture等均会失效。原因在于这些模块针对的是系统原生的SSL框架，而TT自定义了自己的SSL框架。那么如果我们需要对TT进行抓包的话，就需要对TT的检测动手脚，本文章会举例两种方式进行TT(Android)的网络请求获取。(网上都有相关教程，文章仅为自己实践记录)
TT版本为全球版(packageName:com.zhiliaoapp.musically version:25.0.3)。
方式一：通过修改so包跳过SSL检测
常见的抓包方式大多数是使用Fiddler、Charles等工具，本文使用Fiddler进行抓包操作，电脑系统Window 10。
Fiddler的安装及Https抓包配置就不赘述了，自行网上查找相关文章。这里需要注意一点，Android 7+的版本，系统将不信任用户证书，正常通过Fiddler下载安装的证书依旧无法抓包HTTPS。这时需要一台root后的手机，将Fiddler的证书转换为系统证书并安装到手机内。
Fiddler系统证书具体操作
1、点击Fiddler的Tools选择Options，弹窗的选项卡中选择HTTPS，点击右侧Actions选择Export Root Certificate to Desktop将Fiddler证书导出桌面，
2、打开cmd，通过openssl命令获取到Fiddler证书的hash值。
openssl x509 -inform DER -subject_hash_old -in FiddlerRoot.cer


3、将导出的证书重命名，格式为：获取到的hash值.0，如我获取到的hash值为e5c3944b，那么我的证书名字命名为e5c3944b.0。
4、将重命名后的文件放置…</span>

「时光不负，创作不停，本文正在参加2022年中总结征文大赛」
前言
不知不觉半年又过去了，想了想去年立下的 flag 都是有一定难度的（比如 GitHub 2k stars），目前都没完成。原本不知道年中总结写啥好，但是回想了下今年上半年收获到了不少认可，有很多开心的瞬间，可以借此机会分享一下。并且也是作为自己的一个记录，希望以后回看这篇文章能想起当时的喜悦~
上半年最开心的几件事
GitHub 被微软大佬关注了
4 月 8 号的早上打开 GitHub，突然一下子有很多人在 GitHub 关注了我，有点吓到我了，因为平时我的 GitHub 很偶尔才有一两个人关注。正当我疑惑之时，翻到一个熟悉的名字，这不是 Drakeet 吗？！

Drakeet 是一位前微软大佬（离开微软仅仅是因为实现了财富自由不需要太努力了），我当时以为我看错了，在看到那 7.6k followers 后确认了是他本人。那么突然被很多人关注就不奇怪了，Drakeet 的关注者会看到 Drakeet stared following DylanCaiCoding，下面有我的简介“一个兴趣使然的程序工匠”，别人可能会感兴趣点进去看看是何方神圣。
个人的 GitHub 资料有做些门面功夫，可能不少人看了觉得不错就也点了关注。

能被 Drakeet 关注让我非常意外，因为想让别人在 GitHub 关注你是一件非常难的事情，这远比单个库获得 stars 难多了。我很久以前就了解到 Drakeet 了，还作为纯纯写作的用户加过他微信，我知道他的要求是很高的，能出现在他 GitHub 的关注列表我想都不敢想。
那时候 Drakeet 在凯哥星球做嘉宾，我就在星球发了条动态，Drakeet 本人在底下进行了回复。

我当时看到 Drakeet 的回复超级开心，其中提到的“工工整整”…</span>

我正在参加「创意开发 投稿大赛」详情请看：掘金创意开发大赛来了！
前言
终于算是忙完了一个阶段！！！从4月份开始，工作内容以及职务上都进行了较大的变动，最直接的就是从海外项目组调到了国内项目组。国内项目组目前有两个应用在同时跑着，而且还有几个马甲包也要维护，不知道大家发版的时候复杂不复杂，反正我们每次发版的时候都需要经历--打包、加固、对齐、重签名、打渠道包、上传云存储、生成渠道推广链接、生成内更SQL、上传Mapping文件等等步骤(xN)，简直是折磨人啊。
所以首要任务就是做出一套自动化的基础设施来，最初直接考虑到的方案是【Jenkins+Docker+360命令行加固+VasDolly+Bugly等】的方案（下一篇文章会给大家分享该方案），整个过程下来基本能达到自动化的目的。就这么稳定的跑了一个多月，然而，在5月下旬的时候360加固发布了一个通知，大致内容就是免费版用户无法使用命令行的加固方式了，只能手动用工具加固。这就导致最初的方案直接垮掉，我花费了个把月学习Linux，Pipeline，Docker，还制作了各种镜像，结果突然不能用了，心塞。然而路还是要继续走下去的，在尽量不花钱的前提下，想到了开发桌面端工具的方案。
功能一览
接下来先给大家一览下桌面端工具的基本功能，我的电脑是Windows的，所以都是基于Windows平台下的build-tools相关工具进行开发的。首先大部分的功能都是基于jar或exe文件，那么在Java（Kotlin）中我们可以通过如下方式来调用这些外部程序，exec其实最终也是调用了ProcessBuilder，整体的原理就是如此：
//方式1
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd)
    
//方式2

                              <span>前言：在去年的这个时候，谷歌官方推荐使用 Flow 替代LiveData，一年时间过去了，我相信还是有很多android开发的朋友和我一样有以下几个问题：Android开发人员需要从 LiveData 迁移到 Kotlin Flows 吗？LiveData 现在是否已弃用？

🌟推荐阅读：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/139582669
🌟推荐阅读：https://juejin.cn/post/6979008878029570055
通过阅读本文你能了解到或学到什么：
① Flow, Shared flow &amp; State flow的使用(具体操作本文就不多说了，给大家推荐好文)
② SharedFlow 和 StateFlow，它们也有自己的可变类型——MutableSharedFlow 和 MutableStateFlow，对比LiveData我到底用哪一个？
③我们已经有了Flow，为啥还会有SharedFlow、StateFlow，Flow不够用吗？
④我要迁移到Flow吗？
有人问：LiveData是不是真的快要被废弃了。LiveData：你是故意找茬？
我要迁移到Flow吗？
我们先来回答这个大家最关心的问题
🚀结论：如果 LiveData 满足您的需求，那么就不急于替换它，如果是一个新项目，推荐在 UI 中用 LiveData，在Repo层 中用 Flow。
下面请欣赏RxJava与LiveData&amp;Flow的爱恨情仇：
在2017年之前，大家都是使用RxJava去配合Retrofit实现网络请求，RxJava实现事件订阅。但是，谁用谁知道 (真的复杂，各种线程的切换，头脑爆炸，不过，现在用协程就可以啦😻) 。因为是真…</span>

上一篇 《Flutter 绘制探索 | 来一起画箭头吧》 ，实现了一个可以自由拓展的箭头绘制小体系。线和箭头的旋转已经封装好了，只需要在矩形端点矩形域中提供路径即可。本文我们就来对端点的箭头路径进行拓展，丰富箭头的样式，同时也更方便使用者调用。

draw.io 是我最喜欢的绘制软件，没有之一，本文就其中的一些常用箭头端点样式进行实现。通过仿写，可以对其中的箭头进行一些额外的参数配置，来满足更多的配置需求。这就是代码由自己掌控的好处，想实现什么可以自己动手，丰衣足食。

1. 箭头绘制环境
打个比方，我要造火箭的螺丝，并没有必要在火箭生产的现场去制作。在车间中根据图纸，按照尺寸制作就行了，造完后拿过去拧上就行了。这就是对复杂场景进行分离，将相对独立的生产对象独立出来，这样能够简化场景，更专注于做一件事。就像本文，我只想专注做一件事，就是如何在一块矩形区域内，来创建各种各样的箭头路径。
设计感 ，这里画个如下的辅助路径，对矩形区域进行示意。正所谓，磨刀不误砍柴工，通过这个 4*4 的圈格，可以让设计更直观。这就像是一个坐标，一个参考线，能给我们一些 安全感 。

这个背景绘制的代码如下所示，其实就是一些最基本的路径操作而已。对看过 《Flutter 绘制指南 - 妙笔生花》的朋友来说，这些都是小菜一碟：
void main() {
  runApp(const ColoredBox(color: Colors.white, child: Painter()));
}

class Painter extends StatelessWidget {
  const Painter({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

Flutter 里的  BuildContext  相信大家都不会陌生，虽然它叫 Context，但是它实际是  Element 的抽象对象，而在 Flutter 里，它主要来自于 ComponentElement 。
关于  ComponentElement  可以简单介绍一下，在 Flutter 里根据 Element  可以简单地被归纳为两类：
RenderObjectElement ：具备 RenderObject ，拥有布局和绘制能力的 Element
ComponentElement ：没有 RenderObject ，我们常用的 StatelessWidget  和 StatefulWidget  里对应的 StatelessElement 和 StatefulElement 就是它的子类。
所以一般情况下，我们在 build 方法或者  State 里获取到的   BuildContext   其实就是  ComponentElement 。
那使用  BuildContext   有什么需要注意的问题？
首先如下代码所示，在该例子里当用户点击 FloatingActionButton 的时候，代码里做了一个 2秒的延迟，然后才调用  pop 退出当前页面。
class _ControllerDemoPageState extends State {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),

Comprised of 791 individual photos, the seamless video took 22 days to complete and is part of omozoc’s growing archive of woodworking lessons, which you can find more of (make sure you turn your volume up to hear the incredibly satisfying audio) on YouTube.

为什么键盘上的字母按照QWERTY的顺序排列？为什么计算机编程总喜欢“Hello, World”？为什么电视剧时长通常为每集45分钟？为什么高铁座位分布是ABCDF却没有E呢……以上种种问题，都可以用“路径依赖”理论（Path-Dependence）加以解释。
普遍意义上，路径依赖是指一旦选择某一路径（无论是“好”还是“坏”）就可能对这种路径产生依赖，进而沿着既定方向持续前进。这一理论由美国经济学家Paul David在1985年提出，后因美国经济学家Doglass North借该理论阐释经济制度演进规律而扬名。[1]
通俗地讲，“路径依赖”可以被理解为传统惯习的力量，过去的经验被应用于新的情境之下，产生或好或坏的影响。
在互联网发展过程中，也存在着诸多“路径依赖”或“传统惯习”现象，甚至不被我们所察觉。当我们把视野进一步纵向拓展，这些习惯可能来自互联网初期、来自电视或印刷时代，或是更为久远的传播史早期。
本文从路径依赖的理论出发，希望去发现和理解网络生活中的此类现象，并进入媒介演进的视野，探索过去如何影响现在，甚至持续地影响着将来。
信息生活里的路径依赖现象
1868年，一位名叫Christopher Latham Sholes的美国出版商为打字机模型申请专利，并于1874年成功将商用打字机投放市场。
在这六年间，打字机键盘上的字母顺序几经变换，从“ABCDE”到“QWE.TY”，再到“QWERTUIOPY”，随后又调整了“Y”的顺序，最终固定为“QWERTY”。[2]
这一字母顺序借助打字机的行销逐渐成为打字员的习惯，进而延续至今，出现在我们使用的电脑键盘上，这可以看作是一种“路径依赖”。
同时，也有批评者认为QWERTY的布局并不符合使用习惯，因此，旨在提升打字效率的Dvorak键盘于1936年问世，但还是没有影响到前者的主导地位。

一、场景
在日常使用app的过程中，基本上会遇见把窗口缩小的场景出现，比如B站看视频，微信直播，微信视频通话等，主动缩小或者返回都会触发悬浮窗体的显示，如下：
b站
微信视频号









那么实现这种效果一般的思路是怎样，可以继续往下看。
二、思考点
针对窗口缩小或者悬浮窗需要考虑几个重要的点：
悬浮窗体的比例以及层级，层级要在statusbar之下且在activity之上，这样才能保证其不会被其他业务界面覆盖；
悬浮框显示后，内部的视频内容如何无缝衔接继续显示；
三、思路
实现整个悬浮窗的核心在于WindowManager与window的交互。
WindowManager是app与window通信的一个接口。从语义上看WindowManager是用来管理window的一个接口，那么window又是什么？其实我们常见的Dialog、Popup、StatusBar等本质就是window，window是一个抽象类，相当于一个联盟，Dialog、Popup等view只有依附在window这个联盟才能发挥功能，而WindowManager就像是联盟的会长，负责与子view等会员通信，并且能够对他们进行增加、更新和删除。
实现悬浮窗就需要配置不同的参数于属性，关于WindowManager参数、属性的详细资料可以参看https://juejin.cn/post/6844903882158505992
从上面描述可以知道利用addView将View添加在window上，同样的，WindowManager.LayoutParams.type可以设置View的层级，防止被其他业务界面所覆盖。
四、实现
4.1、请求悬浮窗权限

https://github.com/hackware1993/Flutter_ConstraintLayout
前言
这是一份 Flutter ConstraintLayout 的完全指南，基于当前最新的 1.6.3-stable 版本。由于现在的 API 已经稳定，所以本文可能会长期适用，后期仅会有很小的变动。
如果你有 Android ConstraintLayout 的经验，那你能上手更快，但也希望你能认真看完全文，因为声明式 UI 下的用法和 XML 里的用法截然不同。并且它有很多 Android ConstraintLayout 所不具有的优秀特性。如果你是一名 iOSer，那就更应该看完了，据我的了解，不论是 Android 下的 ConstraintLayout，还是 Flutter ConstraintLayout，它们都和 AutoLayout 有很大的不同。
约束布局的本质
任何布局控件的核心都在于计算子控件的大小和位置。而约束布局的核心在于使用约束来计算子控件的大小和位置，而约束的本质是对齐。即指定子控件的上、下、左、右、基线分别和哪些子控件（或 parent）的哪些位置去对齐。这直接决定了子控件的位置，并可能决定子控件的大小（如果子控件大小指定为 matchConstraint 的话）。
用过约束布局的人几乎都回不去了，主要是因为它有两大杀手锏，一是它能让布局层次更加扁平化，这样能带来渲染性能的提升。二是强大灵活的布局（排版）能力能…</span>

1. 认识散列表
1.1 散列表的作用
散列算法是散列表的核心，也就做哈希算法或 Hash 算法，是一个意思。散列算法是一种将任意长度输入转换为固定长度输出的算法，输出的结果就是散列值。基于散列算法实现的散列表，可以实现快速查找元素的特性。
总结一下散列算法的主要性质：
性质
描述




1、单向性（基本性质）
支持从输入生成散列值，不支持从散列值反推输入

                              <span>我非常贪恋睡眠，因为我每天都会做梦，并且第二天起来，我几乎都记得自己做了什么梦。无论是好梦、荒诞的梦、还是噩梦，我都会贪恋其中不愿意起床，它们仿佛短暂的解开了我的脚铐手链，让我飞了一会，飞到了一个和我的真实生活完全不一样的世界。
如果我放任自己开始苏醒，真实生活里的点点滴滴，就会像早晨洗脸被拧开的水龙头的水一样，涌入大脑还泄流不止。一睁开眼睛就开始思考真实生活，真是一件悲伤的事。所以当我不得不起床之后，我总会尽我所能留住那种和现实脱节的感觉，能留多久是多久。能暂时不展开真实生活的点点面相，就暂时不展开。
这种不展开的方式，于我而言就是阅读、纯粹的写作、或者看电影。阅读，是掉入另一个人的大脑去看 TA 写出来的世界；写作，是掉入自己的思想，内观自己的思绪世界；有时我也会一起床先看一部电影。电影，啊，电影，那就是另一个人的故事了，与我完全没有关系的陌生人的生活。这些都是逃离，让我暂时不必被真实生活的清单事项所淹没。
也因此，我的生活在某个节点，被分割成了「之前」和「之后」，这个节点的划分，于我而言就是开微信：查收微信消息的那一刻，就代表着我被拉回现实，开始需要处理跟真实生活息息相关的消息、通知、事项。我上午从不开微信，一般看微信都是下午1点后了。当然，这种回归现实的方式，也是循序渐进式的：1点前后，我会第一次开微信，只是纯粹接收消息，确认无要紧之事后，又立刻关闭微信。直到下午3点我的微信才正式处于常开状态，表示我正式接受来自真实生活里清单事项的随时打扰，繁碎日常正式拉开序幕。
我现在颇享受这种隔离时段式的生活节奏，3点之前专注创作，3点之后回归生活，「回归」这个词已经说明，我刻意与真实生活保持距离的个人态度。我的一天于是就这样拥有了两幅面孔：上午，是流离于真实生活的异想世界，下午，是落地于真实生活的现实世界。那晚上呢？
晚上，是所有互联网产品必争的时段，也是人最情绪化，情感状态最饱满的时候。这个时刻，我又有了一种脱离真实生活的漂浮感，但它和上午的「脱离」还不太一样。上午的脱离感是我刻意营造的，晚上的脱离感则是浑然天成的。它是异想世界和真实生活经过漫长一天的交织、杂融、沉淀之后形成的，自带一种未经雕琢的生野感，能随时将你吞噬，将你包围，张力如此之强，让你无处遁型。所以，人才会多半选择在晚上谈情做爱，那种呼之欲出、溢都溢不住的原始本能，不仅是商家必争，也是艺术家必争。这个最容易飘的时段，我觉得也是最能体现我与自己是否真的自洽的时刻。你能多大程度上接受自己的各种情绪？允许它？放任它？还是压制它？抵制它？与晚上的相处，具有了一种哲学感：是什么？为什么？你想干什么？
可惜，到现在我依然还在摸索与深夜的相处之道：「情绪那么饱满，你总不能浪费吧？」脑子里这个声音颇为强烈，总觉得我应该物尽其用。可每一天的晚上都不太一样，今晚如蜜糖般的度过方式，放在明天也许就是砒霜。何为物尽其用？更何况，多数时候，夜晚让我觉得自己过得失败而忙碌，怎么又是一个颗粒无收，或效果甚微的一天？所以我现在会想，或者，选择给夜晚注入理性哲思，本身就是一个错误，所以我才会屡战屡败，跟它过得如此拧巴。
那不如，就让上午承担想象，下午承担事项，晚上它什么也别承担了。就如情绪，它最需要的也许就只是被看见。也别绞尽脑汁赋予它什么意义，哪有那么多事需要意义？
所以，我总结出了什么吗？我享受我割裂的三段式生活节奏，我给「幻想」和「现实」各自独立的空间，并保证雨露均沾。至于晚上，我不为难它，它也不必为难我。三十后的「自处之道」，大抵如此。</span>

                              <span>这两天在Reddit上看到一个关于「AirPlay 2 on Linux」的帖子，其中推荐了 Shairport Sync 项目，于是我打算给家里在用的树莓派的AirPlay升级一下。大家有能力的可以直接去看原文，里面文档写的很详细。
准备

一台Linux 或 FreeBSD的设备，其性能至少要大于等于树莓派 2
319 和 320端口没有被占用
一个音箱（最好是3.5mm接口）

开始安装
首选建议大家先将系统更新到最新状态，可以大大减少许多莫名其妙的问题。
sudo apt-get update #检查更新
sudo apt-get upgrade #执行更新
关闭Wi-Fi节能管理
如果你使用设备使用Wi-Fi连接的话，需要将节能管理关闭，可以避免安装后设备进入节能后搜索不到音箱。
iwconfig wlan0 power off
安装依赖
以下是Shairport Sync需要依赖
apt install --no-install-recommends build-essential git xxd xmltoman \ 
autoconf automake libtool libpopt-dev libconfig-dev libasound2-dev \ 
avahi-daemon libavahi-client-dev libssl-dev libsoxr-dev libplist-dev \ 
libsodium-dev libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev uuid-dev libgcrypt-dev
nqptp
nqptp是 Shairport Sync 监控时间的重要依赖，需要手动编译安装。

                              <span>近日，少数派首页出现了一篇名为《把握浏览器的「门面」：少数派作者们都在用什么启动页？》的文章。在文章中，几位作者分别介绍了自己喜欢的浏览器启动页插件，评论区也有很多读者分享了自己的解决方案。
可以看出，关于浏览器 newtab 的花样确实很多。网址导航、todolist、番茄钟……各种玩法都很有趣。可我和大家的喜好偏偏相反，我特别钟情于纯空白页，讨厌 newtab 中出现任何元素。🌚
Chrome 浏览器的 newtab 在默认情况下，由早期的空白页不知道什么时候开始变成了 Google 搜索框：
默认 chrome://newtab
如果你想去掉这个搜索框，解决办法是在 Chrome 设置中把地址栏搜索引擎从 Google 改成其他。这时候你会发现， Google 搜索框确实是不见了，可 newtab 的内容又变成了 8 个历史记录中的网站，还关不掉。删掉以后又会出来新的 8 个网站。容易泄露隐私的同时，它给出的建议也不一定用得上……
修改搜索引擎后的 chrome://newtab
而 Edge 这边的情况更加离谱：
Edge 不知是从哪里得来的设计灵感，newtab 变成了新闻股票大杂烩，用户挣 kuī 钱吃瓜两不误。可能是担心瓜的热度太高，造成吃瓜群众中暑，还贴心为你展示了天气信息。
默认 edge://newtab
好在 Edge 可以关闭这个 newtab 中大部分的内容，但最后还剩 bing 搜索框无法去除。左下角还有增值电信业务经营许可证号，真的是想逼死强迫症。🥲
关闭内容展示后的 edge://newtab
1.安装 Super Evil New Tab Redux
为此我找到了「Super Evil New Tab Redux」这款 Chrome 插件，我的需求才得以解决。这款插件可以为 newtab 设置背景色，可以添加自定义 HTML、CSS、JS 代码。
Super Evil New Tab Redux 选项
插件地址：Chrome 网上应用店
插件接管 newtab 之后，默认背景是黑色的，建议修改 Background Color 为白色，或者设置 RGB 值为：255 255 255，这样你就会收获一个纯净的 newtab：

2.修改源文件
虽然 newtab 变纯净了，但还是有一点点不完美：由于 newtab 被第三方插件接管，因此新建标签页时，标签页左侧 favicon 从  Chrome 图标变成了插件图标，看上去有一些违和。这时我发现插件本身已经开源，可以简单修改一下文件就能达到最理想的效果。

2.1 修改newtab.html文件
下载源码并解压，打开 newtab.html文件。
将第 6 行代码中的New Tab修改为：新标签页。
2.2 修改插件 icons
去网络中寻找 Chrome 图标，比如在 iconfont 网站中就可以搜到很多这样的图标。
iconfont
选择一个你喜欢的图标，分别下载尺寸为 512、128、96、48、32、16 的 png 文件。打开插件源码中的「icons」文件夹，按照其中的文件命名规律，对刚刚下载的图标文件重新命名，替换原文件。
替换后的 icons
chrome://newtab 默认 favicon 是灰色的，我使用的是彩色 Chrome 图标，你也可以选择原风格的图标。
2.3 修改 options.html 文件
顺手对options.html进行简单的汉化，使用起来更加直观。

3.载入修改版插件
在 Chrome 中打开 chrome://extensions 页面，开启右上方的「开发者模式」。点击「加载已解压的扩展程序」，选取你刚才修改的 Super Evil New Tab Redux 源代码文件夹。此时经过修改后的插件就可以使用了。

最终效果
经过修改的 newtab 样式已经彻底融入了 Chrome，完全看不出一点违和感。
修改后的 newtab 样式修改后的插件选项
插件同样适用于所有 Chromium 内核浏览器，载入方法也是一样的。
Edge 浏览器使用效果
Edge 浏览器载入该插件后，彩色图标莫名其妙变成了黑白色，但是不影响使用。建议 Edge 用户在上文步骤 2.2 中搜索 Edge 图标进行替换。
Edge：我生气了，哄不好的那种。🙃
你还可以把修改后的插件进行备份，或者放进系统引导盘，让它成为你的装机必备。❤️</span>

然而由于各种原因，我无法将所有我想分享的内容撰成整篇的文章，所以我想通过「档案室」这个系列，不定期记录、分享一些我认为值得分享的、最近在读/听/思考的一些事情，也希望能由此产生一些有趣的讨论。
在看的一本书
《可能性的艺术》 by 刘瑜
刘瑜的几本大众向的书我都看过了，包括《民主的细节》、《观念的水位》、《送你一颗子弹》，这些都是好多年前看的了，具体的内容肯定是不记得的，但是当时看的心情似乎还能想起一些——她的文字简单但清醒、深刻但不做作、知识量又巨大（至少对于非政治学出生的我而言），恰到好处的升华也总是让人读完有畅快之感。
这种感觉我之前似乎忘了，但是在读《可能性的艺术》时，那种感觉又回来了。而且阅读她的书，不仅仅能有知识上的收获——如果你对政治学感兴趣的话——还能有思维方式和写作技巧上的收获。
对于《可能性的艺术》这本书，我认为至少有三个角度来阅读这本书。
第一，是了解「比较政治学」的基本理念及背后的背景知识。通过比较理解政治，比较不同国家在国家能力、国家转型、文化政治发展等不同方面的兴盛衰退及其背后的原因，来理解世界为什么是这个样子。
其中有一个知识上的收获，是让我觉得最值得，也是让我受到震撼的——对于和平的认识。 
在《可能性的艺术》里，有一章叫「和平的爆发」。「爆发」这个词在这里似乎有些不合时宜，但纵观人类历史，和平时代其实是非常短暂的，充满了大规模战争的年代才是「常态」，而我们只是非常幸运地出生在和平的几十年、和平的国家，我们思考的问题是明年要去哪里玩，而不是明天…</span>

Some advice can be a vice. Feel free to take what you can use, and leave the rest.

之前听博主万卉说，人约等于计算机的思维框架对她很管用，她会把时间分成输入、处理、交互、输出这四块，健康的体魄与高效的大脑是好的硬件基础，知行合一意味着好的交互的匹配度，独立思考需要我们拥有好的信息处理能力。
这个思维方式也对我非常有启发，我据此优化了自己日常生活的记录方式。而我目前生活的重心是在输入这一块，我很珍惜自己阅读、听播客的时光，它们在我看来就和玩耍一样有趣，我能持续收获有趣与新奇的感觉，这也让我想到硅谷投资人纳瓦尔Naval所说的：

要想有所专长，就要追求真正的兴趣和热爱，累积专长的过程，对你而言就像玩耍，对他人来说则很吃力。

关于输入，一方面我会筛选自己的信息源，去有意识地主动输入，关于这点想和大家分享张潇雨老师在播客中提到的一个「企鹅理论」，非常形象生动，大致是说：人的大脑是一片冰川，每个记忆点都是一只企鹅。冰川面积有限，每有一只垃圾企鹅进入冰川上，冰川上原有的企鹅就会掉进海洋，所以不要让无用无趣的企鹅，挤掉生动有趣的企鹅。
而另一方面，我也会引入一些随机性，避免自己陷入信息茧房，一位神经和行为科学家Leyla写的文章《Allow error into your life and experience the joy …</span>

前言
数据埋点通常是产品经理、数据分析师基于业务或产品需求对用户行为的每一个事件确定埋点需求。再由客户端上报埋点数据，后端记录数据进行一系列处理，并汇总后提供给产品经理、数据分析师进行数据分析或模型训练，帮助优化产品运营策略。
现有的 Android 埋点方案都存在些弊端，之前看到西瓜视频团队分享了基于责任链的埋点框架，感觉思路还不错。不过只分享实现思路和部分代码，没提供一套可用的框架，其中的埋点线索更是让很多人不理解怎么去实现。
所以个人就尝试封装一下，理解其核心思想后进行了改进和优化，最后仅用了 200 多行代码实现，简化用法的同时还兼顾了 Kotlin 和 Java 用法。接下来和大家分享西瓜视频的责任链埋点思路以及个人改进后的实现方案。
埋点思路
埋点需求
行为分析埋点通常需要包括某一事件发生时的前因、后果，以及事件发生对象的特征。在复杂的数据分析、模型训练等需求中，不仅仅需要获知某个事件的发生次数，对埋点上下文尤为关注。此处上下文指的通常有 2 类，分别是：
事件发生的页面信息和页面位置信息；
用户经过怎样的路径来到当前页面，也就是“来源”信息；
比如西瓜视频点击收藏的埋点场景，要求包含收藏影片的信息，所在的场景信息等。

如果收藏事件发生在列表页，会上报如下的内容：
{
  &quot;event&quot;: &quot;click_favorite&quot;,
  &quot;params&quot;: {
    &quot;video_id&quot;: &quot;123&quot;,                  // 影片ID
    &quot;video_type&quot;: 2,                    // 影片类型
    &quot;page_name&quot;: &quot;feed&quot;,                // 当前页面
    &quot;tab_name&quot;: &quot;long_video&quot;…</span>

                              <span>不知道从什么时候开始，拆解并装裱废弃的电子产品开始流行起来，甚至一些厂商也下场提供了官方的装裱服务。
我收藏了两部诺基亚Lumia925，可惜其中一部已经不能开机了，尝试过刷机救砖也不行，便想着把它也装裱起来，当一个摆设继续发挥余热。
看了下网上卖的模版有点千篇一律，而且价格也不便宜。看了几家店铺的介绍后，发现其实工序并不复杂，就打算自己试一下。开头先给大家分享一下我的装裱成果：

个人还是比较满意的。相框是A4纸的尺寸，整体还是比较紧凑的，因为觉得太大了有点占地方，缺点就是参数不能写得太多，一些小的零件就放不下了，大家如果想要把全部零件都展示出来的话，相框可以选择大一点的。
所需素材&amp;价格：

宜家相框（39元）
铜版纸（4元）
热熔胶（已有的）
双面胶（已有的）
手机拆机工具（已有的）
旧手机（已有的）

因为一些材料是之前就有的，所以整体花费是40多元，大头都在宜家的相框上了，网上应该能够买到同尺寸更便宜的。下面就分享一下具体的步骤。
第一步：拆手机、零件归类
搜索手机型号+拆机教程，就可以找到详细的拆机步骤。如果没有工具的话，网上很便宜就能买一套（其实老手机最需要的就是撬棒）。
拆解的过程大家可以量力而行，把重要的部件拆下来就行，也不一定非要追求「芯片级」的拆解。
拆解之后可以简单把零件归类、简单摆放一下，简单构思一下背景图纸的布局，看看有没有什么零件是可以舍弃的。

第二步：设计、打印背景图片
有了零件之后，就到了发挥大家创意的地方——设计背景图纸。我是用PS先建立了一个A4尺寸的背景，然后将网上查到的主要参数列了上去，因为A4纸空间有限，只分出了屏幕、背盖、电池、主板、摄像头、卡槽和其他组件几个模块。
为了保证原汁原味，下图左上角的logo是我从当年的广告片里截取出来的；右上角的彩条是我根据当年Lumia经典的配色PS上去的，让整体色彩稍微多一些，要不然就太单调了。我把这个背景图纸传到网盘了（提取码：jvgg），大家看得上的话可以直接拿去用。

设计好之后，如果家里有打印机的话，可以打出来看一下位置摆放是否合理，顺便看下字体的大小是否合适，再进行一些微调。
不推荐直接用A4纸，太薄了撑不住零件。我去打印店咨询了一下更厚的纸张，店家给我推荐了300g的铜版纸，价格也不贵（A4尺寸2张4元）。大家想做的话，带着源文件直接找打印店就行。
第三步：粘贴零件、安装相框
准备好零件和背景图之后，最后一步就比较简单了。用热熔胶枪把零件都粘贴在背景图纸上，电池最好直接用双面胶，不要接触高温的热熔胶。粘好后清理掉热熔胶的「拉丝儿」，等上一段时间粘牢固。

宜家的相框有三层，透明面板、中框、背部盖板，粘好零件的背景图纸放在中框和背部盖板之间就可以，如果松动的话，可以用胶水把背景图纸和背部盖板粘在一起。
以上就是所有的步骤啦，虽然整体的精致程度不如网上的一些模版，但是自己动手把心爱的手机装裱起来，这种感觉还是很不一样的，如果你有废弃的旧手机也可以自己动手试试。
