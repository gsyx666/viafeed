AWS Lake Formation is an integrated data lake service that makes it easy for you to ingest, clean, catalog, transform, and secure your data and make it available for analysis and machine learning. 


Lake Formation gives you a central console where you can discover data sources, set up transformation jobs to move data to an S3 data lake, remove duplicates and match records, catalog data for access by analytic tools, configure data access and security policies, and audit and control access from AWS analytic and machine learning services.


Lake Formation automatically manages access to the registered data in S3 via services including AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR Notebooks and Zeppelin notebooks with Apache Spark, and Amazon QuickSight to ensure compl…</span>

                    <span>Simply speaking, Vault3 is a decentralized vault for all your digital belongings, like Passwords, Images, and Files.
Vault3 is our submission for the Hashnode x ThirdWeb Hackathon

In case you don’t know, Hashnode is the easiest way to start a developer blog on your personal domain for free and connect with the readers through its global dev community! 
These days, Web3.0 is catching everyone’s eyes, and as a developer myself, the learning curve is pretty steep. That’s where ThirdWeb comes in! ThirdWeb is a sweet collection of tools that can be used to build sophisticated Web3 apps, with ease.
Tracing Back to Vault3, let’s first see where the Idea came from.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s sketch the use case. We have some roles that can access a particular page.
These valid roles are defined in an array.
const roles &#x3D; [&#x27;moderator&#x27;, &#x27;administrator&#x27;, &#x27;superman&#x27;];

How can we check to see if a user&#x27;s role is part of this list?
For the sake of this article, we&#x27;ll assume the user&#x27;s role is a simple string like so:
cost role &#x3D; &#x27;user&#x27;;

There are a couple of options for us here. Let&#x27;s take a look at each of them.
This might be my personal most used option. It&#x27;s quick and straightforward and has no weird overhead.
This includes method will return true or false if it can find the string you are looking for.
roles.includes(&#x27;user&#x27;);
// false

roles.includes(&#x27;moderator&#x27;);
// true

We can also use indexOf, which will return -1 if it can&#x27;t find the item or the actual index if it does.
roles.indexOf(&#x27;user&#x27;);
// -1

roles.indexOf(&#x27;superman&#x27;);
// 2

This could be super helpful if you need the item&#x27;s index anyway, but I think includes should work better for you if you don&#x27;t.
Another way of doing this is using the some method, this will return a boolean like the includes method.
It will return if some of the items in the array match the search query.
roles.some((role) &#x3D;&gt; role &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;user&#x27;);
// false

roles.some((role) &#x3D;&gt; role &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;moderator&#x27;);
// true

Again, depending on the use-case, this could be the better solution, mainly good if you would have to check for multiple things to match.
The find method is a new way of searching an array, and it will return undefined or the item.
roles.find((role) &#x3D;&gt; role &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;user&#x27;);
// undefined

roles.find((role) &#x3D;&gt; role &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;moderator&#x27;);
// &#x27;moderator&#x27;

This method is perfect if you need the entire object to do something with.
And there you go, multiple ways of checking if an array contains a value.
You can try all of these out in the following CodePen (Note: Open your terminal)

                    <span>If you&#x27;re thinking about a career in data science, this is one of the first tools you should learn. Pandas is an excellent tool, particularly for data analysis. Pandas is said to be derived from the term &quot;panel data,&quot; and it stands for Python Data Analysis Library in full.
The package supports SQL, Excel (.xmls), and JSON files in addition to.csv files. As a result, there is no need to bother with converting files to csv format. Pandas&#x27; ability to re-arrange data into appealing rows and columns is a fascinating feature!
Let’s get started


You must have the anaconda application installed on your PC in order to install pandas. Alternatively,Google Notebook. You may access Jupyter Notebook by typing the keywords Jupyter Notebook into your search bar after installing anaconda. On your machine…</span>

Learn some multi-cursors and selection tricks that you can use in VSCode!
If you prefer to watch the video version, it&#x27;s right here :




 
It will simply create some multi-cursors below or above your line.
If you want to exit the multi-cursor, press escape.
 


  
  
  2. [pushed mouse wheel + go down|up].


It will create some multi-cursors too, it&#x27;s a bit faster than the one above.
 


  
  
  3. [ctrl + d].


[ctrl + d] will help you find some occurrences. For example, if you want to change several divs into paragraphs, pressing [ctrl + d] after highliting one will allow you to do that faster!
 


  
  
  4. [ctrl + shift + l].


You can also find all occurrences at once after highliting something with [ctrl + shift + l]. For example, this will select all the divs!
 


  
  
  5. [alt + click].


Finally, you can use [alt + click] to place a new cursor wherever you want.

CodeWithKenn!

In this article, I&#x27;m about to share with you how I launched a Freelance Business a year and a half ago, working remotely with my clients, after learning Jamstack Technologies (working with Headless CMS).
I&#x27;ve been working with Web Development after discovering the Opportunities behind Web Technologies when I was in my Home Country (Republic Democratic of Congo), since 2018.
I Learnt HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. After working on some small projects, I got into React JS Library in 2019.
I came into the Jamstack industry (especially Headless CMS) at the end of the year 2020, after being challenged by the Job Industry; I couldn&#x27;t get a job, but I need to have my skills tested and improved.

It is essential for any enterprise that is taking its cybersecurity seriously to have an identity and access management (IAM) solution and it is the apt option for them. One can point out who can access which services and resources, as well as under which conditions with IAM. To ensure least-privilege permissions, you can manage permissions to your workforce and systems with IAM policies.
But what is AWS? How will it help enterprises? What are its features? How can you use it to solve the IAM problem? Why choose this? How to get started? What is its pricing? Are these questions wandering in your mind? No worries! Sennovate is here to answer all your questions. So, be with us…</span>

Today, I worked on a lot of different things. I made some progress with learning SQL and Next.js as well as coding the Terms of Use page for my business site. Not too bad I&#x27;d say.
Note: The character in the thumbnail is Lena from 86.
Anyway, let&#x27;s move on to my daily report!
I set my goals for this week, which are:
finish the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages, and then deploy them.
learning more SQL, Next.js, and Scrum.
learned how to render markdown as JSX.
continued going through Next.js &amp; React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
practice doing nested SELECTs.
learn more about how correlated subqueries work.
learned how to use aggregate functions, SUM and COUNT.
continued to go through SQLZoo&#x27;s SQL Tutorial.
read this article, titled Myth 3: In Scrum, releases are done only at the end of the Sprint by Barry Overeem.
it is okay to release updates to production even before the Sprint Review.
it is recommended to keep expanding the Definition of Done (DoD).

                    <span>Hey, there! 
CodeWithKenn!
In this article, we&#x27;re going to see how to choose the right Headless CMS.
If you&#x27;re new to the Headless CMS industry, I wrote an article on the subject, you can get it here. 
What you&#x27;re about to read comes from my personal real-world Experiences, it&#x27;s based on clarity on the issue of the article.
That being said, Let&#x27;s discover together.

Working with different clients on different projects, and each project has its own requirements, it becomes harder to pick and choose the best Headless CMS for your Project. 
Sometimes, it&#x27;s because of the complexity of the features a Headless CMS can provide, or the number of Headless CMS available on the market.
Sometimes you have to ask yourself some of these types of questions: 
What type of project my client needs? An E-co…</span>

                    <span>I covered Raku and Raku regular expressions before, now it&#x27;s time to complete this with an episode about Raku grammars.
Processing text is one of the most common tasks in programming, so most languages since Perl come with some kind of regular expression system. Generally the basic regexps are the same, but each language comes with some unique extensions. Raku notably does not keep the traditional regexp syntax even for the common things, but conceptually they&#x27;re mostly the same.
A regular expression can extract information from a string based on some pattern, but often we need something more advanced. So a lot of languages also have some way to define tokenizers, which chop the string into pieces based on multiple regular expressions. Notably Perl&#x27;s /gc flag, and Ruby StringScanner.

                    <span>I planned this project for a while, and finally just got it done.  In this project, I completely remade Replit Apps with a whole bunch of features.
https://replverse.ironcladdev.repl.co/
So originally, replit apps had no limitations on what image could be uploaded for a cover image and the original algorithm left some projects either trending for months on end (one of mine is still trending after eight months 😭) or nobody sees your project.
This created a problem that some rickrolls, pranks, and other low-quality projects would trend forever.  I decided to change that by creating a new algorithm, adding some highly-requested features, and many more beneficial attributes.
Let&#x27;s get into the tips!

                    <span>We will go over data repersentation of computer systems this chapter. That is, when we need to think in a computer way, you should know how computer think at first (in binary).
What is the base of a number?
And usually, there are different bases we use in studying system, like binary number (base 2), octal number (base 8), and hexadecimal number (base 16). 
We can see them being used in computer world:
Number like &#x27;0X1E&#x27;, is HEX number:
1 Byte &#x3D; 8 Bits

Specially, one another data type in C is called POINTER, which is also significant:
Pointer:
4 bytes in 32-bit-system
8 bytes in 64-bit-system




  
  
  The knowledge that we are reviewing, is usually based on 32-bit systems



  
  
  3. Conversion between different bases



- DEC to BIN:


BIN to DEC: mentioned above
X base number to Y base number: 


X base to DEC
And then DEC to Y base
When comes to 1100 1001 (which is equal to 201 in decimal):
Two&#x27;s complement is used to do the substraction or repersenting negative number in binary (Of course, adding a negative is substracting a positive number).
Get the 0101&#x27;s 1&#x27;s complement in 8-bit machine, having 1111 1010.
Add one, having 1111 1011. Then, 1111 1011 is the number repersenting -5 in 8-bit machine.
They happen when sum of 2 positive (or negative) number but get the negative (positive) number in machine, due to the fact that when machine has no more bit to extend to repersent this number.
Overflow: Sum of 2 positive but get the negative
Underflow: Sum of 2 negative but get the positive

微软专门针对国内用户发布了一款“微软电脑管家”的软件。官方介绍称：“微软电脑管家聚合了微软 Windows 系统强大的底层研发能力，搭配微软独有反病毒引擎，全面构建您的电脑防护体系。主打低占用、不打扰、干净、不捆绑的产品特点，为用户提供电脑体检、反病毒、主页反劫持、电脑垃圾清理等功能。”不过，虽然该软件的开发商是世纪互联的子公司北京蓝云公司，但是微软表示该软件隶属于微软。

波士顿动力的机器人从 DHL 获得 1500 万美元的工作机会

去年 3 月，波士顿动力公司公布了其第二款商业机器人 Stretch。该机器人建立在箱子搬运概念之上，旨在将该公司的先进机器人技术带入仓库/物流环境中。最近，波士顿动力公司 宣布，物流巨头 DHL 已经承诺与其达成一项为期多年、价值 1500 万美元的合作，它将在未来三年为 DHL 物流中心带来一支机器人队伍，首先它将负责从卡车上自动卸货，随后还将增加更多的任务，以进一步实现包裹处理过程的自动化。

Let&#x27;s Encrypt 错误签发数百万张证书

Let&#x27;s Encrypt 工程师称在 2022 年 1 月 26 日 00:48 UTC 部署修复程序时发现，所有通过 TLS-APLN-01 质询颁发和验证的证书都是错误的，需在 5 天内让错误证书失效，计划 从 1 月 28 日 16:00 UTC 开始吊销错误证书。但并非所有证书都受此问题影响，预计不到 1% 的活跃证书受此问题，影响当前已经向相关用户发送邮件通知。


老王点评：保险起见，无论是否收到邮件，还是重新签发一下比较好。</span>

                    <span>开源世界是建立元宇宙的首选之地。




如果我告诉你，构建元宇宙所需要的所有内容和软件都已经有了，而且完全免费，你会去构建吗？

先别急，让我们退一步来解释一下元宇宙。

什么是元宇宙？

20 世纪的赛博朋克作家，如 Gibson 和 Stephenson，都曾想象过由虚拟现实支持的互联网，在 Stephenson 的小说《雪崩Snow Crash》中，他将其称之为元宇宙Metaverse。随着虚拟现实virtual reality（VR）设备和应用程序的日益普及，尤其是在马克•扎克伯格宣布将雇佣 1 万人来打造它，并将 Facebook 的公司名称改为 Meta 之后，元宇宙正在成为一个热门词汇。Matthew Ball 对该话题进行了 认真分析，并以“共同构建”作为结论：“事实上，最有可能的是，元宇宙是来自不同的平台、机构和技术的网络中，它们协同配合（无论多么不情愿），并拥抱互操作性。”

互操作性，这个词本身含蓄而清楚地指出了开源和开放标准在其中的作用。

因此，简而言之，它就是支持 VR 的互联网。

如何建立一个开源的元宇宙？

就像互联网上的网络服务器一样，你需要 VR 服务器。不过不用担心，我写了一个，而且 介绍它的文章 大约一年前就发表在这里了。当然，你需要支持 VR 的网络浏览器，但网络浏览器已经支持视频/音频流（WebRTC）以及 VR 和 AR（WebXR）。此外，你还需要大量 3D 内容，最好是开源标准的 glTF 格式。幸运的是，Sketchfab 拥有 50 万个以上的免费 3D 模型，由大量的作者在知识共享许可Creative Commons licenses下发布。Sketchfab 并不是唯一一家这样做的公司，但他们提供了 REST API 来搜索和下载这些模型。

别忘了键盘

在 VR 中已经待了一段时间了，…</span>

                    <span>Higher education institutions are actively looking for ways to adapt to rapidly improving technology and enable students to use advances in computing to study, collaborate, and learn in new ways. Many institutions have been using open source software to exchange knowledge more easily, ensure a better learning experience, and handle administration with fewer worries.
Demand for open source software in higher education is drastically increasing especially as the need for remote learning grows.

                    <span>I’ve had many conversations recently that have me looking at a crucial question that impacts neurodivergent corporate employees and their managers: how do we understand, encourage, measure, nurture, and assess the career development of neurodivergent people? Development opportunities, and how managers assess performance, are critical aspects of career growth, financial compensation, morale, feelings of self worth, happiness, employee retention, and the ability of individuals and companies to achieve their goals.

对少数派而言，这个帮助我们适应改变、拥抱全新协作模式的工具就是飞书。从最初的浅尝辄止到如今几乎人人都「长在飞书上」，少数派团队内部不同部门在这个过程中也早已根据实际情况发展出了适合自己的飞书使用方法。
因此在本次 2021 年度征文活动的特别赞助伙伴飞书的邀请下，本文中我们也请来几位少数派产品组、编辑部和 Matrix 社区运营的小伙伴，跟大家聊聊少数派是如何使用飞书的。
小团队也可以做起来的评论与库存管理
少数派的网站管理后台是我们自己开发的，网页形式呈现的后台完全满足数据管理的需求，缺点就是无法像应用推送一样及时弹出更新、报错、警告等重要消息，这就有点麻烦了。管理后台即使做上网页实时通知也是通过浏览器做推送，一专注工作的话很容易忽略。管理员和编辑上班了通过浏览器进入后台工作，下班了谁还会守着浏览器呢？
决定将工作 IM 切换到飞书之前，我们当时用的是 Slack，那时也在使用群消息机器人，将一些电商库存信息推送到 IM 平台上。使用飞书之后，我们发现其实可以将更多业务场景下的系统通知都整合进来。

比如我们一直在用的商品库存管理，设置只要某个商品某个规格的库存少于 20，就会自动向电商群组里发消息。而且为了防止消息被忽略，库存少于 20 …</span>

毕业论文的意外收获
我作为一个食品安全专业的大学生，在学校时接受了完整的食品安全教育，对于食品添加剂、农药残留等当时社会热点问题理解深刻。比如那时的我认为，农药残留只要符合国家根据人体的毒理学特点制定的安全标准，并且经过科学、合理的检测过程，得出的农药残留数值达标就意味着农产品是安全的。
所以，那时的我深信，我们的农产品和食品的生产，对人体健康不会造成不良影响。社会公众需要的是更好的科普，以便更多的人理解在农残、食品添加剂这些热点问题中，「不谈剂量就是耍流氓」。国家需要做的是更严格地执法，避免不法分子，尤其是那些缺少知识、没有文化的小商小贩们为了一己私利而坑害公众健康。至于大企业、大农场、大工厂生产的农产品和食品，在正规的商超进行销售，那就安全无虞，放心吃就是了。
然而，深信了接近 4 年之后，快要毕业的时候我发现，我还是太年轻了。这种感觉，来自我毕业论文的一个意外收获。
青稞面条的研制
我的毕业设计是研发一种青稞面条的配方，其目的是利用青稞中的 beta-葡聚糖含量较高的特点，增加面条中 beta-葡聚糖的含量，从而降低糖尿病人吃完面条后血糖升高的速度和血糖峰值，起到减缓糖尿病症状的作用。
这里我们先进行一点点科普。糖尿病分为 1 型糖尿病和 2 型糖尿病。1 型糖尿病是先天性的，可以理解为一种基因缺陷，患者的胰岛素绝对缺乏，相对很少见。绝大多数糖尿病患者罹患的是 2 型糖尿病，它是后天产生的，患者的胰岛素只是相对缺乏，多与肥胖、高血压等并发。其产生的机理可以大致的理解为，由于饮食过量过甜、缺乏锻炼等原因，进食后血糖快速升高。此…</span>

0 写在最前面
2021 年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔 1-2 年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在 …</span>

操控党之所以留恋汽油味，因为汽油味某种程度上是一道门槛。


「汽油味儿」所指为何？
到2020年，汽车行业发展已经超过130年，而在前120年里，地球上的汽车品牌一直在减少，没有增加。
主要原因是汽车行业是一个高壁垒的行业，内燃机、变速箱将大多数实力薄弱的新兴企业隔绝在外，并逐渐演变成大国国力角逐的主要领域---汽车行业直接决定了一个国家的工业地位。小国即便以举国之力也无法建立一家成熟的汽车企业，为此全球主要汽车品牌都集中在美、日、德、法、中等几大经济体。
虽然内燃机和变速箱构建了汽车行业的门槛，但并不作为汽车企业的核心竞争力。汽车品牌之所以得以传承，在于打造始终如一的驾控风格，这一点在汽车品牌的宣传中显而易见。

宝马在上个世纪30年代首次提出了「乐趣」的概念，并逐渐演变成「纯粹驾驶乐趣」（Sheer Driving Pleasure）。为此，所有的发动机、变速箱都围绕这个概念展开，即便经过了直列发动机到涡轮增压发动机的转变，这个品牌精神一直都在。

福特也在上个世纪中叶提出了「Drive a Ford and FEEL the difference」的品牌概念。这个概念在2000年前后被福特重新重视，并发展为福特的品牌理念。海外为「Drive Difference」，中文为「Feel The Difference」，翻译为「感受非凡」，接着为中国消费者提供了一连串驾控优秀的福克斯、蒙迪欧等车型。
这也就是为什么操控党钟情「汽油味儿」。
电气化之后，新势力涌入，性能虽然非常夸张，通过堆砌电池、电机做出远超内燃机的数据，但操控始终无法令人满意，甚至有些糟糕，只能通过智能体验吸引用户。驾驶风格作为汽车企业的核心…</span>

                    <span>这实际上是一个“功能安全”问题 —— 由于电子电气功能不正常工作而导致人身安全风险的问题。
啥叫电子电气功能不工作呢？ 
比如说，不踩油门它自己加速、挂了前进档车却往后移动…… 这是比较严重的，很可能会出或大或小的事故。
也有一些“看起来不太严重”的，比如仪表黑屏、中控黑屏。 当我还是一名功能安全工程时的时候，我一开始想：黑就黑了呗，车照样可以开，有什么大不了的呢？当年Benz发明汽车时，没有仪表不照样开吗？
我的领导不这么想，在他的引导下，我们使用HAZOP、HARA等方法，分析了“黑屏”的各种可能性：

高速上突然黑屏 → 引起驾驶员惊慌分神 → 部分水平较差的驾驶员，慌乱中误以为动力系统也失效了 → 紧急靠边停车的过程中发生碰撞 → 人身伤亡
高速上突然黑屏 → 驾驶员忘了仪表上还有车速 → 驾驶员在长时间不知道确切车速的情况下继续驾驶 → 对车速判断失误造成追尾或其它碰撞 → 人身伤亡
停车场突然黑屏 → 驾驶员立刻刹停观察现象 → 安全
停车场未黑屏，但屏幕死机了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡
停车场未黑屏，但屏幕卡顿了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡

第五种情况实际上发生过：
车主曝特斯拉“挂D挡往后走”！后台数据公布：前后换挡多达14次
总体来说，传统车企的功能安全工程师认为：仪表与中控都是安全相关的，(至少仪表)功能不能出错：无论任何情况下，既不能黑屏，也不能死机、卡住。
但我想，这要求未免有点太高了。因为过高的可靠性，意味着成本…… 成本最终还是给消费者的。
为此，我曾向多位传统车企的功能安全工程师提出一种不成熟的想法：

 在卖车的时候，提醒消费者“咱们这车啊，在高速上是有可能黑屏死机的；莫慌，继续开即可”。当驾驶员有黑屏的心理预期之后，第一次遇到黑屏也不会慌，从而避免了事故。

关于这一点，我有实际体验：
第一次遇到黑屏时，好慌，大概花了5秒钟我才确认“车子还可以开”、“只是个小事情，镇定”、“导航信息没了，还是赶紧找机会停车重启吧“！
第二次遇到黑屏时，一点也不慌了 —— 因为心里有预期它会黑屏，所以造边停车重启，常规操作了。

 仪表与中控可以失效，但是要求：一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。如此一来，就避免了仪表与中控显示错误的误导而造成的事故。

不出意料，传统车企听了我的想法后都直摇头：你这么做，与特斯拉有什么区别？ 出了事故，特斯拉扛得住舆论，咱们可扛不住啊！
想想也对，这不单单的工程技术的事情，也要考虑车企的公关思路不同。综合考虑后，每个车企只能选择最适合自己的技术方案。
尽管如此，我还是向特斯拉提一个建议，可以让车主更安全： 仪表与中控可以失效，但是一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。

At some point in time, we have all encountered conversational agents -Siri, google assistant, Alexa, and others.
In this article, I&#x27;m going to show how to build a simple conversational agent in python using the pre-trained Blenderbot model.

According to  Wikipedia, a conversational agent (CA), is a computer system intended to converse with a human.
In other words, conversational agents are automated systems(mostly powered by AI) that are built to converse with humans using natural language.
Common examples of conversational Agents include -  Siri ,  google assistant  ,  Alexa ,  Cortana 
Since this tutorial is built around Blenderbot, it&#x27;s …</span>

In the third and final article of our series on the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks, we’ll explore the lesser-known risks associated with the development of web applications on Rails when it comes to threats involving security misconfiguration, JSON escaping, etc.
We’ll also discuss the importance of logs and metrics to increase the level of security of your applications.
As with the other articles, RailsGoat will be used to explore some aspects of these threats in practice. If you&#x27;re new here, please refer to the previous two articles to get the app set up and get acquainted with what we’ve explored so far. Let&#x27;s jump right in!

I have enjoyed using React.js for the past year. It makes creating UI&#x27;s simpler and that is what i appreciate about it. As a frontend developer, it is only right to be curious about trending tools and frameworks from time to time hence i tried my hands on Next.js and i was totally blown away.
Nextjs is an open source React framework created by Vercel. What makes it efficient is that it enables several extra features, including pre-rendering, web app preview and fast compilation.

In part 3 of the series, Guide to Churn Prediction, we analyzed and explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset using the descriptive statistical analysis method and gained an overview of the data.
This guide assumes that you are familiar with data types. If you’re unfamiliar, please read blogs on numerical and categorical data types.
Let’s understand some statistical concepts that help us in further analysis of the data.

                    <span>How has the web evolved, and more importantly – where is it going next? Also, why do any of these things matter?
The web has evolved a lot over the years, and the applications of it today are almost unrecognizable from its most early days. The evolution of the web is often partitioned into three separate stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.

Web 1.0 was the first iteration of the web. Most participants were consumers of content, and the creators were typically developers who build websites that contained information served up mainly in text or image format. 
The next iteration of the internet was called the “web 2.0” or the “read-write” web. Now, users were not just idle visitors, they could create their own content and upload it to a website. It could support near real-time interactions…</span>

                    <span>A no-code app builder is a great resource for creating your own application without programming skills or a huge budget. These platforms often have the pre-built templates, drag-and-drop functionality to design UI, and integrations with  databases, so they can ultimately be deployed as your own mobile or web app.
There are many no-code app builders on the market, and it can be hard to find the best option, especially because you can often only see a landing page, marketing information, and exciting slogans. 
Serhii Pospielov, AI Practice Head at Exadel, reviewed several no-code app builders from a developer&#x27;s point of view. He tried to create MVPs on 13 different platforms, but only managed to achieve that on five (this doesn’t mean that the other eight aren’t good platforms – just that they didn’t meet his particular business need).  Serhii’s favorite no-code app builders were: 
Appery.io, 
AppGyver, 
Check out his Best No-Code App Builders (Part 1) on Medium and see the other top platforms in his list along with their screenshots of interfaces. 
You’ll also find concrete information about the difference between no-code and low-code mobile app builders, the role of back end on a mobile application, the key stages in developing a mobile app, and more things to consider when evaluating the costs of no-code app builders.</span>

                    <span>JavaScript list of operators containing question marks might surprise new developers approaching the language for the first time. 
nullish coalescing operator (??) works. 
Following MDN definition, &quot;The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy&quot;.
condition ? expression1 : expression2

You can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. 
This is not entirely accurate but before diving into truthy and falsy let&#x27;s see an example with a condition that can only be true or false.
let condition &#x3D; true;
console.log(condition ? &#x27;exp 1&#x27; : &#x27;exp 2&#x27;); // exp 1

Since we defined a variable called condition as true, the ternary operator executes the first expression which is a simple string &quot;exp 1&quot;. 
The console.log() around the ternary operator logs the result of the ternary operator and it logs &quot;exp 1&quot;.
As I said above, you can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. But this is not entirely accurate!
So, what is the problem?
When talking about Javascript Ternary Operator, MDN talks about truthy and falsy instead of true and false.
condition ? expression1 : expression2

IF the condition is truthy execute expression1 else (falsy) execute expression2.
In simple terms, 
Truthy values are equal or can be converted to true. Which values are truthy? All values unless they are defined as falsy. Thanks…
Falsy values are equal or can be converted to false. (i.e. false, 0, -0, 0n, &quot;&quot;, null, undefined, and NaN).

See some more examples using the ternary operator with strings and numbers.</span>

                    <span>Project: Codever - File:  user.router.js
The values are present in the request.body which contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body.
In our case we access the userDisplayName with the following expression request.body.userDisplayName as in the example below:
usersRouter.post(&#x27;/:userId/bookmarks/upload&#x27;, keycloak.protect(),
  uploadBookmarks.single(&quot;bookmarks&quot; /* name attribute of  element in your form */),
  async (request, response) &#x3D;&gt; {
    userIdTokenValidator.validateUserId(request);

    const userDisplayName &#x3D; request.body.userDisplayName;
    const importResponse &#x3D; await browserBookmarksImportService.imporBrowserBookmarks(request.params.userId, request.file.buffer, userDisplayName);

    const str &#x3D; JSON.stringify(importResponse, null, 2); // spacing level &#x3D; 2
    console.log(str);

    return response.status(HttpStatus.OK).send(importResponse);
  }
);

In angular the userDisplayName value has been appended to the FormData and submitted to a post request
  uploadBookmarks(userId: String, bookmarks: File, userDisplayName: string): Observable {
    const formData &#x3D; new FormData();
    formData.append(&#x27;bookmarks&#x27;, bookmarks);
    formData.append(&#x27;userDisplayName&#x27;, userDisplayName);

    return this.httpClient.post(&#x60;${this.usersApiBaseUrl}/${userId}/bookmarks/upload&#x60;, formData);
  }

                    <span>In software engineering, SOLID is an acronym for 5 design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, robust, and maintainable. Adopting these practices can contribute to avoiding code smells too.
The 5 SOLID principles are:
  S - The single-responsibility principle
  O - The open-closed principle
  L - The Liskov substitution principle
  I - The interface segregation principle
  D - The dependency inversion principle
Although the SOLID principles apply to any programming language, in further section I will be explaining each of them with examples written specifically in JAVA.
This principle states that “a class should have only one reason to change” which means every class should have a single responsibility.

                    <span>Even before the prevalence of hybrid and distributed-first working, the regular standup meeting has established itself as the pulse that keeps our teams moving. The name “standup” is an artifact from the intentional activity of conducting the team meeting while standing together.
If you want to skip ahead please install this free extension to enable VS Code to regularly apprise you of progress.
If you don&#x27;t regularly attend team meetings such as standups, checking in with yourself regularly is still useful. It will help you understand if your efforts are helping to achieve your goals and enable you to identify distractions.
These days, it’s safe to say that most of us (accelerated by this global pandemic) are joining standups sitting in a chair from the comfort of our home via Zoom. What we’ve come up with is basically a way for VS Code to automate your standup contributions. Right from within VS Code.

If you are a native of terminal. We&#x27;ve got you covered, too. You should give the standup CLI a spin. Install instructions for both CLI and the VS Code extension are available here.

It will be great if you will contribute something to this project. Documentation, sharing the project in your social media, bug fixing, refactoring, or even submitting issue with question or feature request. Thanks anyway )
Just type
composer require mezon/html-template

First of all you need to create object.
use Mezon\HtmlTemplate\HtmlTemplate;

$template &#x3D; new HtmlTemplate(&#x27;./main-template/&#x27;);

This code assumes that you have all template resources in the directory ./main-template/.
But you can also specify a list of paths, and while template compilation they all …</span>

From powerful productivity improvements to entire new panels, they’ve been continuing to close the parity gap and innovate with new means of debugging and improving our web experiences.
The Chrome team just released a new panel that makes it very straightforward to record and replay user flows: the Recorder panel.
That means it’s high time for another Chrome&#x27;s DevTool update, so let’s jump right in!
If you’ve ever found yourself having to repeat the same navigation steps over and over again in a web app in order to investigate a bug, then this might change your life!

                    <span>First was the personal computer revolution, followed by the evolution of mobile computing. It&#x27;s predicted the next technological frontier could be an entire digital universe dubbed the metaverse. Powered by advanced computing and virtual reality, we could experience digital lives similar to video games inside the metaverse. This sounds far-fetched, so is it endless possibilities or all hype? Here are some ideas for how the metaverse could change the world and some ways that it could all be smoke and mirrors.
The term metaverse was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash. Since it has been depicted in other science fiction works like Ready Player One and The Matrix.

But for those who haven&#x27;t been living under a rock for the past decade, for better or for worse much of the web has been moving to client-side navigation on their sites.
This movement has been fueled by the adoption of tools that support this sort of architecture. The &quot;modern&quot; JavaScript framework is designed to build applications. Single Page Applications. A name originated from the fact that it does not go back to a backend server to navigate between pages. All routing happens in the browser.

                    <span>美国部分企业关键芯片的库存只能支持数天

美国商务部称，芯片短缺的情况将会持续，企业部分关键零部件的库存只能支撑不到五天。调查显示，关键芯片库存中值已从 2019 年的能够支撑 40 天下降到 2021 年的不到五天。与此同时，对芯片的需求也比 2019 年高出约 20%。调查显示，芯片供需存在严重、持续的错配，受访者认为这个问题在未来六个月内不会消失。

谷歌宣告放弃 FLoC

谷歌两年来一直计划用其他技术来取代 Cookie，以向用户提供有针对性的广告，其使用的是一个名为 FLoC 的系统。FLoC，即“群组联合学习”，将通过使用一个浏览器内的算法来取代 Cookie。该算法将分析用户的浏览历史以确定用户的“兴趣群组”，而广告商根据群组精准投放。其设计初衷是为用户提供一定程度的隐私，但谷歌表示 FLoC 可能不足以保护用户的身份。此外，该系统也遭受到广告商的强烈反对，并在欧盟受到投诉。多家基于 Chromium 的浏览器开发商也都决定禁用 FLoC。周二，谷歌表示向有关拟议的投诉让步，转而计划采取 不同的方法。


老王点评：本质上，谷歌就是一家广告公司，所以它设计的方案自然得不到信任。




由于积极行动，大规模的 Log4j 攻击没有到来

Sophos 认为，因为该漏洞的严重性使数字和安全社区团结起来，激励人们采取行动，攻击者大规模利用 Log4j 漏洞的直接威胁 被避免了。该公司指出，在 12 月 20 日至 23 日期间，被其防火墙阻止的 Log4j 攻击达到顶峰，然后在 1 月期间逐渐减少。


老王点评：但这并不意味着我们已经摆脱了风险，在未来几年会持续有黑客利用这些漏洞发起攻击。</span>

                    <span>用这个开源的终端会话记录器 Asciinema 来展示终端会话。




支持电话是很重要的，而且最后往往是令人满意的，但明确的沟通行为对每个参与的人来说都是艰巨的。如果你曾经参加过支持电话，你可能会花好几分钟拼出了最短的命令，并详细解释了空格和回车的位置。虽然直接拿过来用户电脑的控制权往往更容易，但这并不是真正的教育的最佳方式。你可以尝试向用户发送一个屏幕记录，而他们可以复制命令并粘贴到自己的终端。

Asciinema 是一个开源的终端会话记录器。与 script 和 scriptreplay 命令类似，Asciinema 准确记录了你的终端显示。它将你的“电影”记录保存到一个文本文件中，然后根据需要进行回放。你可以把你的电影上传到 Asciinema.org，就像你在互联网上分享任何其他视频一样，你甚至可以把你的电影嵌入到网页中。

安装 Asciinema

在 Linux 上，你可以使用你的包管理器安装 Asciinema。

在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia 或类似系统上：

$ sudo dnf install asciinema


在 Debian、Linux Mint 或类似系统上：

$ sudo apt install asciinema


在 macOS 上，你可以用 Homebrew 安装：

$ sudo brew install asciinema


在 BSD 和任何其它平台上使用 Pkgsrc：

$ cd /usr/pkgsrc/misc/py-asciinema
$ sudo bmake install clean


从文本中制作电影

要用 Asciinema 开始录制，你可以使用 rec 子命令：

                    <span>“上游upstream” 和 “下游downstream”这两个术语是相当模糊的，我认为一般人并不会真正使用它们。如果你只是一个 Linux 用户，并且不编写或维护软件，那么很有可能这些术语对你来说毫无意义，但它们对 Linux 世界中各个社区之间的交流方式有益的。

这些术语被用于网络、编程、内核，甚至在非计算机领域，如供应链。当我们谈论上游和下游的时候，讨论背景是很重要的。

在其最简单的形式中，上游和下游是信息流动的方向。

由于我们都是在连接到互联网的情况下阅读这篇文章的，让我们看看适用于互联网服务提供商（ISP）的上游/下游例子。这里，ISP 关注的是流量。上游流量是指数据是从不同的 ISP 的用户处传来的。例如，如果你有一个提供订阅通讯的网站，我发送的订阅信息就是上游数据。

下游流量是指从一个用户发送到不同 ISP 的另一个用户的数据，它被认为是下游流量。使用同样的订阅例子，假设我的订阅请求被批准，我在一封邮件中收到“欢迎”说明，在又一封邮件中收到最新的新闻简报。在这种情况下，数据是顺流而下的，因为它是由你（好吧，可能是作为代表你进行操作的自动化软件）发送给我，一个来自另外 ISP 的用户。

总结：我需要或想要的东西（你的通讯）是上游的。你提供给我的东西（欢迎词和实际的通讯）是下游的。

数据是在上游还是在下游，对我们用户来说可能并不重要，但对监控带宽使用的服务器管理员，以及发行商distributor（发行版的制作者）和程序员来说却很重要。

在 Linux 世界里，上游和下游有两个主要背景。一个是关于内核的，另一个是关于应用程序的。还有其他的，但我希望我可以通过这两个来表达我的想法。

Linux 内核背景下的上游和下游

Linux 就是 内核。在创建发行版时，Linux 发行版首先使用未经修改的内核源代码。然后添加必要的补丁，对内核…</span>

                    <span>It seems everyone is rushing to get their software on the cloud. The rapid growth of cloud computing has empowered hyperscaler cloud providers to market various technologies to feed the growing demand.
Hyperscalers are now providing full-stack capabilities to increase their footprint and further lock-in customers, making the cloud seem more like a threat than an open communal space. 
What does the cloud actually offer? Quite a lot, based on reports from the field:

                    <span>前言
哈喽，又是我，欢迎回来「Geek7even《极物研习社》」
2个月前，笔者所在单位进行了办公室搬迁，顺便给所有人升级了一波办公环境▽▼

▲△笔者是个桌搭爱好者，家里两套桌面都走的深色系风格。而在办公室这种明亮的空间，配上浅色的桌椅，便心痒痒想要搭一套简单干净的浅色系办公桌面。想着“给自己一个舒服的工作环境，毕竟一天有1/4都在这里度过“这一借口，剁手起来也没有那么心疼了
桌椅基建
笔者家里卧室是用的西昊M57B，一年多使用下来，坐感舒适，前段时间问了屁股君，它也表示肯定，便随手推荐给了行政。没想到公司一下采购了20来张，用于新办公室的设备升级▽▼

▲△几个大男孩光是安装椅子都弄到腰疼，早知道推不需要用户自行安装的Herman Miller算了（狗头）
西昊M57售价不到千元，这是市场竞争最激烈的细分价格档之一。各大主流品牌都在这一细分价格档推出了不少具有竞争力的产品。甚至光看外表，长得跟几千元的高端款椅子区别也不大（虚荣心作祟）▽▼

▲△金属五爪、透气网面、可调节扶手、腰靠、颈靠，该有的一个不少，性价比非常高。笔者觉得预算不多，但又想体验比较好的人体座椅的时候，瞄准千元这个价位去选择，遇到的坑和雷会少很多
而桌子则统一采购的电动升降桌，原本在用的两张网易严选被我们拉进了黑名单，电机启动时（下降）总有一下顿挫感，桌子用得越久震感越强，实在难受。在线下的办公座椅店逛了一天后，敲定了来自9am的这款企业级电动升降桌产品▽▼

▲△不要被定价吓到，因为走得大宗订单，下单了18件，定制选配1.4米桌板后价格还是比较划算的
9am的pesk系列电动升降桌，是目前笔者摸过用过的电动升降桌中，电机运行最稳定，工作噪音最低的产品了。而且是三段式桌腿，最低高度能到60cm，个子小点的伙伴也不需要被86cm高的桌子折磨

2个月的体验下来，pesk确实贵有贵的道理。电机稳定性无与伦比…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(0 min)</span>
                    <span>前言
最近用 Adobe Illustrator 绘制了一大堆图标，操作基本都保持右手握鼠标、左手小拇指以 Ctrl 为圆心在键盘上活动的状态。在绘制过程中左手常常需要按下大量的快捷键，为了提高效率，我把快捷键设定在了键盘最上面一排的功能键上。而实际用起来，从 F5 键向右，操作逐渐又不方便起来了。
我开始想象：如果有一个小的键盘可以放在左手旁边、每个按键都能映射为不同的快捷键就好了。这个理想中的键盘需要满足这几点：

可自定义按键功能，实现快捷操作；
体积小，按键尽可能多；
造型简洁，最好是无线；
可以根据当前软件自动切换按键功能（加分项）

根据以上要求，很快我就搜到了这次的主角：微软蓝牙数字键盘。
功能简介
技术规格
微软蓝牙数字键盘的键位与普通键盘的数字区基本一致。通过蓝牙与电脑配对成功后，左上角的按键可以快速打开计算器进行计算。另外，它可以同时与3台设备配对，通过背面的按钮进行切换。
安装键盘配套应用的「微软鼠标和键盘中心」后，18个按键中，有17个都可以自行设置功能（计算器键只能打开计算器或充当 NumLock 键）。通过 basic settings 可以设置全局按键功能，在 app-specific settings 中可以为不同应用单独设置按键功能，从而实现切换应用时自动切换案件配置方案。
应用中可选择的众多预设功能列表
在「微软鼠标和键盘中心」中提供了众多预设功能，利用列表的最后隐蔽着的 Key Combination 和 Macro 设置自定义快捷键、录制宏，则是让这个键盘成为真正的效率神器的关键。
使用体验
以 Adobe Illustrator 为例，它的快捷键组合非常多，其中不乏要按下 Alt Shift Ctrl 的同时按下一个字母键的，难以单手操作；想要为常用的一些操作设置快捷键时，不仅要考虑能否轻松地单手按下，又要避免与现有的快捷键重复。使用微软蓝牙数字键盘设置快捷键可以不用考虑能否单手操作的问题，即便远在键盘两端的 Shift + Ctrl + 9 也可以通过指定的一个按键完成操作。
我将使用频率较高的快捷键映射到这个键盘，又为一些原本没有快捷键的高频操作设置了新的快捷键。如下图将快捷键设置好之后，绘制图形的效率显著提高。例如原本需要 Ctrl + C、Shift + Ctrl + V 两步操作的「就地粘贴」操作，现在只需要按下「.」键即可完成。
我设置的按键功能与对应快捷键
上图中大部分是通过 Key Combination 设置直接输入对应快捷键，「就地复制」的功能是通过 Macro 设置实现。值得一提的是，你还可以在 Macro 设置中输入鼠标按键和鼠标位移。
Key Combination 的设置界面Macro 的设置界面
总结
微软蓝牙数字键盘外观小巧简洁；功能上不仅能满足日常办公、媒体控制这些基本操作，也可以在图片处理、视频剪辑等场景下提高效率，甚至用来玩游戏、演示幻灯片……只要根据你的使用场景进行设置，这样一个特别的小键盘也一定可以成为你的效率神器。

@Voyager_1：《写出我心》
如果希望从这本书中获得什么写作的技巧和手法之类，大概会失望而归，因为这本书几乎没有写到任何写作的方法论。但如果你正处在想写未写、能写却觉得写不好、写过一些却因为拖延没能继续写的状态，那么你一定要读一读这本书。

作者娜塔莉·戈德堡（Natalie Goldberg）是一名诗人、画家、作家和书写教练，1986 年出版的这本《写出我心》中倡导的「用写作来修行」，是她禅修多年的核心体悟，也是她往后多年开办「真正的秘密」写作营的核心理念，这一切最终也让她成为了世界级的写作名师。
习得性的技能往往可以用「道、器、术」来做个贴切的比方，拿写作来说：让你知道写作是由心而发，在你心中的念头，无人能帮你写出一篇佳作，讲求的是「道」；教你运用纸笔、电脑甚至软件来更好地写诗、散文或小说则是在传授「器」的使用方法；最后才到我们熟悉的描述事件时尽量写清楚时间、地点、人物的小学作文技巧，这是市面上最常见的写作书题材，也是最泛泛而不可论的「术」。真正的大师不会教你「术」，而会将你指引到你的「道」上，娜塔莉就是这么做的。
事实上本书的结构非常松散，从「初写者的心、笔和纸」、「堆肥」、「别和苍蝇结婚」等章节标题中，你只能窥见一点不明所以的关键词。但娜塔莉设身处地给你讲述的各种经历、思考，穿插了她或其禅师的妙语和人生体悟，足以让你心中激荡起写作的激情，脑中迸发出对写作这份修行的思考，因为她本身就是一位循循善诱的写作老…</span>

                    <span>这两年大概是我们这代人经历过的最特殊的一段时光了，突如其来的疫情让整个世界变了样，本以为会是短暂的噩梦，却没想会成为一场持久战，甚至持久到改变了我们的生活——比如被迫成为宅男宅女。
今年春节是第二次在外过年了，全区核酸检测也已经开始了，不知道有多少人不仅会被迫异地过年，甚至会禁足家中。作为一个不久前因为手术禁足家中三月的人倒是对此有很多心得。
 
生活总要继续，既然我们无法选择，那只能尽量让自己过的舒服一点，除了冰箱里塞的满满当当的牛排鸡翅车厘子可乐外，还有一些好玩的东西可以帮助你度过这段家里的日子，让2022的生活开始的不那么糟糕。
主子‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍
如果有的话。

家里有个会蹦会跳还不是熊孩子的活物当然是最好的，猫主子总能治愈一切，虽然有时候逼逼叨叨的也很烦，但rua几下肚子就能让对方放下身段发出满足的呼噜声，不仅主子不会再唠叨了，你也被解救了，被需要的感觉总是很好的。

而且，每天例行的逗猫、喂粮、换水、铲屎还能帮你在暗无天日的居家中养成规律的作息，每天早上叫醒你的不是上班闹铃，而是主子的呼唤，这样当结束这段日子之后，也能无缝转换回坚强的打工人。

一套好听的音响
宅家里最怕的是什么？寂寞。就连强大如汤姆汉克斯也需要和“星期五”逼逼叨叨才能熬过寂寞的日子，所以一个人宅在家中一定要让家里有些声响，毕竟在自己的BGM里没人能打败你。虽然可能是被迫宅家，但在家的一大好处就是可以用音响，相比耳机有更广的声场，更好的氛围，也不会因为长时间佩戴而不舒服。
比起传统的有线HiFi音响，我在家都是用的WiFi无线音响，一方面没有麻烦的布线，其次是用手机、iPad和Mac通过AirPlay播放音乐更方便，WiFi音响虽然音质不如有线HiFi，但也是远胜于蓝牙音响的，而又没有HiFi有线音响布线和音源功放的繁琐，是比较平衡的选择。

而且，WiFi音响在宅家时还有一个好处，在不同…</span>

吸引创作者的底层逻辑：流量与收益
经过快 20 年的产品迭代，内容产品/社区吸引创作者已经有了非常标准且清晰的「底层逻辑」：要么有流量，要么有钱赚，至少做好一个就能到一定规模。
有流量，简单解释就是：1）在新场景中高效率产生新内容，例如手机、VR 等；2）在新需求中高效率生产旧内容，例如 B 站、知乎、小红书等。
有钱赚比较好理解，即创作者可以通过自己的作品获得或多或少的收入。在过去的逻辑中，流量是一切的前提。
流量哪来？
创作者生产的内容最终目的都是给目标用户消费，两者会在不同的地方达成严肃（付费）或松散（关注）的契约关系，但在实际履行这些契约时会面临两个具体的问题：

两个同样喜欢周杰伦但使用不同音乐 app 的粉丝天然是不平等的：QQ 音乐的周杰伦粉丝可以随时收听他的音乐，但网易云音乐的粉丝却无法做到，有钱也不行。这与渠道方签署独家协议类似：作为一个创作者，是否愿意放弃履行在其他渠道的契约？
不同的内容发布渠道有各自的规则，因为日活、关注 feed 渗透率、算法以及平台运营和管理方向的关系，只有非常少的渠道可以让创作者发布的内容稳定送达给订阅者，因此我们总是会听到「我是不是被限流了」「怎么没有看到你的更新」这样的声音，让成功履约变的困难。

「流量 &#x3D; 影响力，影响力 &#x3D; 收入」已经成为当前创作者的金科玉律，目前市面上的流量一共就三种类型：公共流量（广点通、穿山甲等广告平台，花钱就能买）、平台流量（内容平台内部流量，算法和运营想给谁就给谁）、社交流量（微信、QQ 等自己可控的社…</span>

                    <span>文|邻章
造车，被视为是苹果进一步实现市值突破的关键举措，而在苹果历史战绩之下，业内更是预期苹果造车将高度整合硬件、软件和服务，颠覆当前汽车行业，再次改变游戏规则。
但从现实来看，苹果造车却似乎正处于利空频现阶段——密集的人事动荡、举棋不定的造车战略、受到挑战的供应链强势地位以及特斯拉已然树立起了电动汽车事实标准。
在业内高预期与现实境遇所形成的强烈反差之下，不由得让人疑惑：我们是否在幸存者偏差之下，高估了苹果的造车能力？

一、高度动荡的汽车管理团队
自苹果“Project Titan”计划以来，七年时间内，苹果汽车管理团队成员一直都处于高度动荡之中。
捋一捋苹果造车时间线，能够发现苹果汽车管理团队核心领导已经来到了由苹果机器学习副总裁John Giannandrea领导的第四代管理层，在其前面的三任领导人则分别是初代iPod团队领导人Steve Zadesky、苹果首席硬件工程师Bob Mansfield和原特斯拉工程高级副总裁Doug Field。
但苹果造车管理团队的动荡，不仅体现在核心领导的频繁更替，同时也体现在众多分项工程业务线领导的持续离职。
在此最新一例是苹果汽车软件工程主管Joe Bass，其在服务了苹果公司七年之后，转而加盟Meta公司，任混合现实技术的项目管理总监。虽然这被坊间戏称为是“造车已经没有元宇宙吸引人”的最新例证。
但于苹果而言，却可能是其造车计划进展不利的又一例证。毕竟综合业内报道来看，在Joe Bass离职之前，离职苹果汽车业务线的业内大牛还有诸如原宝马电动汽车研发Urlich Kranz、苹果汽车项目雷达系统的首席工程师Eric Rogers、原特斯拉软件主管CJ Moore、苹果汽车项目电池系统部门的工程经理Alex Clarabut、硬件工程经理Stephen Spiteri、以及领导汽车相关的机器人技术团队的Dave Scott、…</span>

                    <span>“效率”，放置在个人和整体中，这是一个做事的时候皆需要考虑的词。在个人层面上，我们谈论“效率”时，通常它的前面会有一个修饰语，比如“学习效率”、“工作效率”。在我们说提高效率的时候，指的是在做一件事时，能够用更快的速度，更简单的方式实现它。高效也是一个大多数人都关心的话题，而且“如何利用各种效率工具让自己变得更高效”，似乎已经成为了一个预设好的、默认的好的事情。
在2021年，我也不出意外地使用了很多软件、尝试了很多种工具，主要包括知识的获取和整理，时间和日程的管理。与之前不同，我的一大改变是不再追求更复杂更齐全的功能，更倾向使用简单的、但可以达到核心需求的工具。
一、效率背后的逻辑
在聊具体的效率工具之前，我们先捋一捋效率背后的逻辑。
有效、无效和半有效时间
提高效率，换一个说法就是节省时间。从时间这个角度出发，我们先分解我们平时在工作和学习时花费的时间，看看我们到底把时间花在了哪里。如果把工作或者学习的时间摊开来看，可以把整块时间分成三块，分别是有效时间、半有效时间和无效时间。
有效时间指的是那些真正有突出的进展的时间，它只占整块时间的很小一部分。突出的进展就类似解决了某个bug，看懂了某个原理。这样的时间也可以被认为是做事时真正有用的时间。
所谓无效时间指的是做一件事情的过程中完全不用花的时间，这段时间纯粹是无用时间。举个例子，如果要使用远程服务器跑一段程序，那么设置IDE的远程连接可以说是在这个场景下最优的做法，而其他的方法，比如将代码文件传输到远程服务器再进行操作就可以说是一种更花时间也更不便利的做法，而后者所花费的无用的调试、修改、重新传输文件的时间，就可以被认为是无用时间的一种，它完全不创造任何成果。
然而在有效时间和无效时间之间，我认为还存在一种半有效时间。半有效时间指的就是表面上看起来并没有什么成效、但是却不可避免的出现在工作或学习的场景下的那些时间。半有…</span>

Hello 各位好，我是小豪。
今天想和各位分享一个有意思的小项目——用快捷指令 App 和 GitHub，自动记录每天的起床时间。
这个项目源于之前介绍过的 running_page 作者 @yihong0618 的另外一个项目「早起记录」，它可以实现的效果如下：
每天起床关闭闹钟后，触发快捷指令 App 运行程序，在 GitHub issue 下面会生成一段话，包含今天的气温、起床时间（具体到秒）、随机的一句诗。

我觉得这个小项目挺有意思的，不仅可以记录每天起床的时间，还能体会到自动化程序在我们日常生活中的应用。
在项目作者 @yihong0618 老师的指导下，我也顺利了弄出了相同的程序，从此就可以记录我这只懒猪🐷的起床时间啦：

原作者 @yihong 0618 项目地址：
https://github.com/yihong0618/2021/blob/main/get_up.py
我的起床时间项目地址：
https://github.com/phh95/get_up
 
下面是实现自动记录起床时间的过程：
创建一个 GitHub 仓库
在 GitHub 上创建一个仓库，名字可以随意取，这里我将仓库取名为 get_up。

复制代码
从我的 get_up 仓库中复制 3 个文件，分别是：

.github/workflows 路径下的 get_up.yml 文件
get_up.py 文件
requirements.txt 文件

修改代码
打开复制的 get_up.py 文件，定位到第 11 行代码，你可以修改中间的「懒猪🐷起床啦，赶紧去跑步，上班不迟到。」，这里的语句，决定了最终在 issue 中生成的内容，你可以将它改为你喜欢的内容。

定位到第 50 行代码，如果你每天起床的时间早于 6 点，那就需要将 6 更…</span>

@Voyager_1：《写出我心》
如果希望从这本书中获得什么写作的技巧和手法之类，大概会失望而归，因为这本书几乎没有写到任何写作的方法论。但如果你正处在想写未写、能写却觉得写不好、写过一些却因为拖延没能继续写的状态，那么你一定要读一读这本书。

作者娜塔莉·戈德堡（Natalie Goldberg）是一名诗人、画家、作家和书写教练，1986 年出版的这本《写出我心》中倡导的「用写作来修行」，是她禅修多年的核心体悟，也是她往后多年开办「真正的秘密」写作营的核心理念，这一切最终也让她成为了世界级的写作名师。
习得性的技能往往可以用「道、器、术」来做个贴切的比方，拿写作来说：让你知道写作是由心而发，在你心中的念头，无人能帮你写出一篇佳作，讲求的是「道」；教你运用纸笔、电脑甚至软件来更好地写诗、散文或小说则是在传授「器」的使用方法；最后才到我们熟悉的描述事件时尽量写清楚时间、地点、人物的小学作文技巧，这是市面上最常见的写作书题材，也是最泛泛而不可论的「术」。真正的大师不会教你「术」，而会将你指引到你的「道」上，娜塔莉就是这么做的。
事实上本书的结构非常松散，从「初写者的心、笔和纸」、「堆肥」、「别和苍蝇结婚」等章节标题中，你只能窥见一点不明所以的关键词。但娜塔莉设身处地给你讲述的各种经历、思考，穿插了她或其禅师的妙语和人生体悟，足以让你心中激荡起写作的激情，脑中迸发出对写作这份修行的思考，因为她本身就是一位循循善诱的写作老…</span>

                    <span>又是一年春节到，大家都准备好怎么过春节了吗？每年春运似乎都是一场酣战，从抢票、防疫，到收拾行李、排解路上的无聊时间，都是我们关注的话题。因此，我们为你整理了这篇春运小贴士，希望能帮到你。
安全最重要：面对疫情，做好防护
如今的世界疫情横行，在许多人不得不「就地过年」的当下，如果你有幸能够在春运时节踏上返乡的旅途，做好安全防护无疑是重中之重。在此时的长途旅行之中，最重要的莫过于基础的防护措施 —— 口罩戴好（别忘了多备几个）、勤洗手消毒、非必要不交谈。
尽管消毒洗手液很可能无法带上火车或者飞机，公共场所通常都会配备消毒设备，可以利用；此外还可以携带消毒湿巾等以备急用。在人流量较大的场合，比如车站、机场，也务必注意戴好口罩并保持社交距离。在这里，我们就疫情可能对你的返乡旅途造成的影响，列出一些可能有用的工具，希望能够帮助你在疫情中保护好自己，顺利返乡。
各地防疫政策查询
由于疫情瞬息万变，各地的疫情防控政策也处于不断的变动当中。中国政府网（中华人民共和国中央人民政府官方网站）已上线疫情防控政策查询系统，我们只需选择出发地和目的地，就可以查看这两地城市的最新疫情防控政策，以及出发时和落地时可能需要准备的疫情防控相关的材料（比如健康码、核酸检测报告等） 。
通过对比两地政策，我们就可以知道目的地能不能去、出发地可不可离开、离开或者到达时需要准备什么等等。
 深圳」的查询结果&quot;&gt;
此外，还可以通过官方「国务院客户端小程序」微信小程序、支付宝 小程序 等进行疫情防控政策的查询，查询结果与上文网页一致。可以用对应 app 扫描下方的小程序码，即可打开疫情防控政策的查询页面。

此外，如果对查询结果有疑问，还可以拨打查询结果页面上提供的电话进行咨询，获得政策发布方的一手政策解读。

吸引创作者的底层逻辑：流量与收益
经过快 20 年的产品迭代，内容产品/社区吸引创作者已经有了非常标准且清晰的「底层逻辑」：要么有流量，要么有钱赚，至少做好一个就能到一定规模。
有流量，简单解释就是：1）在新场景中高效率产生新内容，例如手机、VR 等；2）在新需求中高效率生产旧内容，例如 B 站、知乎、小红书等。
有钱赚比较好理解，即创作者可以通过自己的作品获得或多或少的收入。在过去的逻辑中，流量是一切的前提。
流量哪来？
创作者生产的内容最终目的都是给目标用户消费，两者会在不同的地方达成严肃（付费）或松散（关注）的契约关系，但在实际履行这些契约时会面临两个具体的问题：

两个同样喜欢周杰伦但使用不同音乐 app 的粉丝天然是不平等的：QQ 音乐的周杰伦粉丝可以随时收听他的音乐，但网易云音乐的粉丝却无法做到，有钱也不行。这与渠道方签署独家协议类似：作为一个创作者，是否愿意放弃履行在其他渠道的契约？
不同的内容发布渠道有各自的规则，因为日活、关注 feed 渗透率、算法以及平台运营和管理方向的关系，只有非常少的渠道可以让创作者发布的内容稳定送达给订阅者，因此我们总是会听到「我是不是被限流了」「怎么没有看到你的更新」这样的声音，让成功履约变的困难。

「流量 &#x3D; 影响力，影响力 &#x3D; 收入」已经成为当前创作者的金科玉律，目前市面上的流量一共就三种类型：公共流量（广点通、穿山甲等广告平台，花钱就能买）、平台流量（内容平台内部流量，算法和运营想给谁就给谁）、社交流量（微信、QQ 等自己可控的社…</span>

为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。
我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。
为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。
短信转发至 iPhone 效果
在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App
🔗 下载地址：App Store
Bark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 &gt; Bark 服务端 &gt; 苹果 APNs 服务器 &gt; 你的设备 &gt; Bark 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，app 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。
第一次打开 Bark 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 app 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。

When the Red Planet was just 43 million miles away, Hubble snapped this picture with the WFPC2. It has a surface resolution of just 10 miles. This is the best image we’ve gotten of Mars that didn’t involve sending a robot there.
Sadly, after further analysis, it appears that the briny subsurface ‘lake’ researchers reported at Mars’ south pole is much more likely to be a huge mass of volcanic rock.In 2018, European Space Agency (ESA) researchers reported signs suggesting the presence of a mass of liquid water at the planet’s south pole.

Delaying
Lambda is event-driven, meaning it starts running when an event triggers it. Because of this, it does not support delaying that event and start processing at a
later time.
While it could wait as part of its code, that is an expensive operation as you need to pay for the total runtime of the function multiplied by the memory
allocation. Also, the maximum time a function can run is 15 minutes. In theory, you could use a small Lambda for waiting and call itself to extend the hard
execution limit, it is more of an interesting development challenge than a realistic approach.
In AWS, you can use Step Functions to solve this instead. It is an orchestration service that allows you to define a workflow as a state machine and it can

CS professional development (PD). Tom&#x27;s tweet was talking about virtual vs

general but the article actually led to some deeper issues with PD.
VAST majority of CS PD
is provided for by &quot;content providers&quot; - people with a product to
sell. That might be a curriculum, a technical platform, or both but
something to sell. It&#x27;s not just CS knowledge and how to teach
it. I include organizations like code.org in this bucket because while
they&#x27;re not selling in the same sense as a textbook publish, they are
selling or pitching their curriculum and platform.

Before we dive into the deeper learning of computer system, the best way getting a comfortable start is to see the bigger picture of computer system structure. I think it is important for the beginner who just start learning Computer System or Operating System.
Just like a hamburger, which has different layers like piece of bread, vagetables, beef, cheese and so on, computer systems also are dive into different layers. 
Layers in hamburger:

Layers in Computer Systems: 

As we can see, computer systems could be divided into three big layers, which are: (Up to down)
All kinds of applications that we use daily
2.Operating System Layers
Operating System -- A special application between software and hardware, which is used to transfer user&#x27;s or applications&#x27; &quot;codes&quot; or &quot;instructions&quot; and then letting the hardware understand how to manipulate the menory.
3.Hardware Layers
Including CPU, disks, registers, RAM and so on.
Specially, and generally we can divede them into five main components (based on every single component could be dived deeper to study at the following chapters)
Input/Output ports. (I/O ports)


Central processing unit. (CPU)


Random access memory (RAM)


Secondary storage device (SSD)


Operating System (OS)

Today we will be walking through the third installment of the series on How To: Build A Linked List. Here are the links to the first two installments: 1 and 2. Please feel free to read those if you haven&#x27;t or reread to refresh your mind. 
We will be focusing on how to add insertion functionality via an insert() and traverse() method to our class LinkedList.
These two methods are definitely more challenging than the previous but together we are going to make them fully comprehensible and readable. 
Let&#x27;s get started!
1. Mapping Out insert()
2. Checking Parameters
3. Creating a New Node
4. Build traverse()
5. Traverse the Linked List

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, I will share my experience freelancing lately and share insights.
Let’s jump right in!
Freelancing is selling services at a fee to people who need those services. Say you are a plumber in a big city or town, you could market yourself as a plumber who is available on call to fix leaking faucets, etc.
The same goes for copywriting, Software development, Graphic design, UI/UX design. 
The hardest work in freelancing is combining:
Interpersonal skills
Business skills
Technical skills (expertise)
Interpersonal skills involve communicating with clients being empathic with their needs and finding a better way to solve these needs.
Business skills on the other hand involve running a business- Market, paying bills, saving some money, and keeping the business running.…</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t miss shaking hands. I think the first year of my career in DevRel I was sick after every single conference or meetup. In fact, I don&#x27;t think I could get through single trip for business or leisure without getting sick during or immediately after. 
Some of this probably had something to do with stress or being a contact lens wearer. I got Lasik in 2017 and stopped touching my eyes twice a day which I&#x27;m sure helped. Stress is probably unchanged.
I&#x27;m confident the majority of it had to do with planes, trains, automobiles, and shaking hands with literally hundreds of people. No conversation in my personal space started without a hand shake. 
Those were the days... filled with Con-flu &amp; PAX-pox.

                    <span>Introduction


Set objects are constructed using new Set().
A set is a “set of &quot; unique values. Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.
Sample code showing a simple Set object usage:
function main() {

    const gameScreen &#x3D; document.getElementById(&#x27;game-screen&#x27;)
    gameScreen.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27; updateAction)

    const cursorPositions &#x3D; new Set()
    function updateAction(event) {
      let position &#x3D; {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}
      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case
    }
    // use unique cursorPositions below
}

while(true) {
  main()
}

Duplicate values are discarded when added to a set. This is useful for capturing and storing unique values where duplicate values are not needed.
const letters &#x3D; new Set()
letters.add(&#x27;A&#x27;)
letters.add(&#x27;B&#x27;)
letters.add(&#x27;A&#x27;) // duplicate entry is ignored
console.log(letters) // Set {2} {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;} 

The set object provides a way of storing data where duplicate values are not required.
Note: Most languages including JavaScript offer a lot of language features but it’s not a good approach to try learning all these language features at a go. However, knowing they exist is enough as it helps one know where to look when the need arises.</span>

                    <span>Introduction


In this blog article, we shall learn about map objects introduced in ES2015. Maps are key-value pairs, where the key can be of any type.
It&#x27;s a typical practice in JavaScript to use Object literals as maps, most likely because Object literal predated Maps.
Map objects can be created using the new Map() keyword.
Sample code showing how to create a map object and add some values using Map.set():
const studentDetails &#x3D; new Map()
studentDetails.set(&#x27;age&#x27;, 25)
studentDetails.set(&#x27;class&#x27;, 2018)
studentDetails.set(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;Naftali Murgor&#x27;)

In object literal, the following would have been equivalent of the above:
const studentDetails &#x3D; {
  age: 25, // made up
  class: 2018,
  name: &#x27;Naftali Murgor&#x27;,
}

Map offers useful helper methods compared to using object literal.

I’ve always loved to learn.  I want to know what makes the world work and why. There are so many interesting and beautiful things in our universe:  Music, Language, Mathematics, Spacetime.. And I&#x27;ve wanted to learn about all of them! Well, now I’m in my 30s and I can say that I have, in fact, learned about all of them. Well, not everything about all of them… but I have spent a considerable amount of time learning about each one, and most of what I know I have learned on my own. 
For the past year and a half, I have been dedicating my time to being a self-taught Software Engineer. I left my job as a high school computer science and mathematics teacher here in NYC to pursue a change and start a new career. After teaching people how to learn for many years, …</span>

The name of the project is LinkAnswers and it&#x27;s a different kind of Q&amp;A for developers:
Write the answers on your domain and then add a link to it.
Unlike traditional Q&amp;A, we give back to the contributors 🥰
https://linkanswers.com
Anyone can post a question, like a normal Q&amp;A, however you can write the answers on your domain and then add a link to it.
Basically it&#x27;s a Q&amp;A that wants to give something back to contributors.
Personally I am in the top 1% of StackOverflow and despite all the time spent on the site, I get basically nothing from there.
It would be nice to have at least some visitors and organic traffic to your website...

                    <span>So, approximately 3 years ago I posted my first entry which tackled the question of what should I go next on my web developer career. 
At the time, I had finished a mid-size project with my employer, with the opportunity to choose a tech stack, design and develop the architecture of the application. It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.
Anyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that&#x27;s the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.
Well then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for &quot;production&quot;). 
Hopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn. So now the next step is to take this experience and continue the journey. It&#x27;s still just the beginning.</span>

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are tokens that are unique and cannot be interchangeable. They are different from other tokens because they can represent unique assets or digital collectibles. Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
NFTs and Smart Contracts on the Blockchain
NFTs and smart contracts are two of the most important features of the blockchain. They are what make the blockchain a powerful tool for creating and managing digital assets. NFTs are stored on the blockchain in a decentralized manner, which means that they are not controlled by any single entity.

                    <span>Hi welcome to part 2 of the comprehensive guide to Svelte.
In this article, we will be learning how to fetch API data using Svelte. We will be using the GitHub API to fetch data about repositories.
First, we need to install the Svelte npm package.
$ npm install svelte
Next, we need to create a file called app.svelte.
&#x60;



GitHub Repository Data





const url &#x3D; &quot;https://api.github.com/repositories&quot;;
const request &#x3D; new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open(&quot;GET&quot;, url, true);
request.onload &#x3D; function() {
const data &#x3D; resp.body.data;
console.log(data);
}
};
request.send();
&#x60;
In the code, we first define the URL for the GitHub API. We then create a new XMLHttpRequest object. We open the GET request and set the URL. We also set the true parameter, which ensures that the request is made asynchronously.
We then define two functions, onload and onerror . onload will be executed when the request is loaded, while onerror will be executed if there is an error. We then send the request.
If the request is successful, we will get the response body. We will then extract the data from the body and log it to the console. 
You can try running the code in your browser. You should see the data for all the repositories on GitHub.

                    <span>Hi, this is Yaku and I just want to talk about Svelte.
Svelte is a new JavaScript framework that is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. 
Svelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. 
One of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. 
Svelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. 
Svelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient. If you are looking for a new JavaScript framework, Svelte is definitely worth considering.

                    <span>Understanding the difference
In Java, we know that for checking if the two values are equal or not we use &#x3D;&#x3D;.
For example if we execute the following code,
public static void main(String args[])
{
        int a&#x3D;5;
        int b&#x3D;5;
        int c&#x3D;7;

                    <span>Java Semaphore简介
信号量（Semaphore）的概念是由荷兰计算机科学家艾兹赫尔·戴克斯特拉（Edsger W. Dijkstra）发明，较为广泛地应用于计算机操作系统进程通信，其核心原理是维护一个计数值，通过等待（wait）或者释放（release）操作来减少或者增加计数值。当计数值为零时，等待（wait）操作需要等到该计数值重新大于0时才能成功。

不同的编程语言一般都有Semaphore的实现，Java语言中Semaphore是concurrent包中提供的一个并发控制工具...</span>

                    <span>Meta 正在建造世界上最快的 AI 超算

Facebook 母公司 Meta 宣布 它正在建造世界上最快的 AI 超算 RSC。Meta 研究人员表示，新超算将能处理有数万亿参数的神经网络，相比之下 OpenAI 的自然语言处理神经网络 GPT-3 有 1750 亿个参数。新超算计划在今年年中完成建造，将使用 16000 个 GPU，储存容量达到 1 EB，能每秒处理 16 Tbps 的数据。


老王点评：这是为 Meta 宇宙准备的吧。




俄罗斯自研操作系统 Phantom OS 预计今年问世

俄罗斯花了 12 年研发的 Phantom OS 始于 2010 年，计划在今年推出原型操作系统，并创建基于 Genode 微内核的操作系统。其定位于 Linux 系统的竞争者，主打更好的性能，主要用于可穿戴及嵌入式设备。它有一个独特的“永不停机”的设计理念，可以将指定状态的快照存储到永久性存储设备中，一旦断电或者出现其他意外情况，系统可以回滚到最后一次状态并继续工作，好像一切都没发生过。


老王点评：所有宣称取代 Linux 的，最终都不了了之。




去年发生的数据泄漏事件远超历史记录

据一份 新发布的《2021 数据泄露报告》，在过去一年中共发生了 1862 起数据泄露事件，刷新了 2020 年（1108 起）和 2017 年（1506 起）的最高记录。报告还指出，涉及勒索软件的攻击在过去两年中每年都增加一倍，占 2021 年报告的网络攻击总数的 22%，按照这种增长速度，勒索软件攻击将超过网络钓鱼。


老王点评：勒索软件威胁已经成为了头号威胁，不过似乎国内企业对此的感受不深。</span>

                    <span>Google Chrome 无疑是 可用于 Linux 的最佳网页浏览器 之一。无论你在什么平台上使用它，它都提供了用户体验和功能集的良好融合。

另一方面，Brave 作为跨平台可用的、以隐私为中心的开源选项而广受欢迎。

那么，你应该选择哪一个作为首选网页浏览器呢？Chrome 适合你吗？谁应该使用 Brave？

在这里，我们比较了两种浏览器的所有重要方面（包括基准测试），以帮助你做出决定。

用户界面



Google Chrome 用户界面干净、开箱即用，没有不必要的干扰。

根据我的经验，默认情况下，它与 Linux 上的（GTK）系统主题融为一体。因此，根据你的自定义设置，它可能看起来有点不同。



如果你不在 Linux 上使用它，那么除了配色方案外，其他所有界面都基本相似。

而对于 Brave，它并不能开箱即用地适应你的系统配色方案。但是，你可以在它的外观设置里启用 GTK 主题。

Brave 与 Chrome 的用户界面接近，但有一些独有的调整/选项。



就用户界面而言，两者都不错，都很容易使用。

但是，Brave 提供了一些自定义外观的附加选项，例如删除选项卡搜索按钮（左侧到最小化按钮）、显示完整的 URL 等。



如果你觉得这对你有用，Brave 就更适合你。使用 Google Chrome，你在 UI 定制方面没有太多控制权。

开源与专有



Brave 是一个基于 Chromium 的开源网页浏览器。顺便说一句，我们还有一份 不基于 Chromium 的开源浏览器 的列表。

Google Chrome 也基于 Chromium，但它添加了几个专有元素，使其成为一个闭源产品。

虽然你可以期待 Brave 的开源和透明度带来的好处，但考虑到 Google 有专门的安全团队，他们在修补…</span>

                    <span>OpenBoard 是为中小学和大学定制的交互式开源白板。让我们来看看它提供了什么。




有几个可用于教育的开源工具，但是，并非所有这些面向中小学和大学的软件都能达到商业软件级的良好维护。

OpenBoard 就是这样一个不同凡响的自由开源工具，它可以不打折扣地为教育服务。它是一个交互式白板程序，具有所有基本功能，并支持各种硬件。

OpenBoard：自由及开源的交互式白板



作为一个自由开源的程序，OpenBoard 看起来是一个令人印象深刻的选择。

瑞士日内瓦州的教育部门（DIP）与 GitHub 上的社区一起维护该工具。

通过交互式白板促进简单的数字教学不应该花费很多，这就是 OpenBoard 的优势所在。

它提供的一系列功能对大多数中小学和大学来说应该是足够的。

虽然我无法在中小学/大学环境中测试它，但我会重点介绍它提供的主要功能。

OpenBoard 的特点



交互式白板没有众多花哨的功能，但足以使教师能够尽可能轻松地表达自己。

我注意到的一些特点包括：


跨平台支持

能够自由地写写画画

能够添加注释

能够删除注释

可以使用荧光笔高亮显示你的白板的部分区域

单独互动和移动创建/绘制的项目

按顺序添加多个页面，可以继续教学而不需要擦除

能够在页面间滚动浏览

绘制线条（从三种不同线宽中选择）

切换手写笔模式（如果你使用的是手写板或类似的东西）

轻松擦除在白板上创建的项目

可以从一组不同的背景中选择，包括把它变成黑板或带网格线的背景

各种必要的应用，包括计算器、地图、尺子等，都可以通过拖放使用

提供的一些形状，可以使绘图更容易

能够向你的白板添加音频/视频，并无缝播放，以获得更好的体验

虚拟激光笔

可放大和缩小

书写文字，调整大小，并克隆它

从白板中对屏幕进行截图

需要时可使用虚拟键盘


在我简短的测试中，用户界面和可用的选项工作得非常好，没有任何故障。



当然，你的体验将取决于设备的类型和你的设置。你可以用 Wacom 平板、双显示器设置，或者通过支持触摸的笔记本电脑使用投影仪来尝试。

在 Linux 中安装 OpenBoard

更好的是，它可以在多个平台上使用，包括 Windows、macOS 和 Linux。

如果你使用的是 Ubuntu，你可以到官方网站下载 DEB 文件。另外对于其他 Linux 发行版，你可以选择通过 Flathub 安装 Flatpak 软件包。


OpenBoard


结语

总的来说，我发现它在使用和导航方面毫不费力。你可以在多个页面之间快速切换，无缝擦除/添加项目，同时还可以在白板上添加丰富的元素。

通过虚拟激光笔以及一些应用，使得它适合在各种中小学和大学中使用而没有任何障碍。

我不知道它是否可以被称为谷歌课堂或 Miro 白板功能的替代品，但对于更简单的使用，OpenBoard 可以胜任。

如果你还没有试过，我建议你试一试。你知道有什么比这更好的东西吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。

                    <span>One of the primary functions of computers is to parse data. Some data is easier to parse than other data, and voice input continues to be a work in progress. There have been many improvements in the area in recent years, though, and one of them is in the form of DeepSpeech, a project by Mozilla, the foundation that maintains the Firefox web browser. DeepSpeech is a voice-to-text command and library, making it useful for users who need to transform voice input into text and developers who want to provide voice input for their applications.

                    <span>I like the Groovy programming language a lot. I like it because, in the end, I like Java, even though Java sometimes feels clumsy. And because I like Java so much, I don&#x27;t find many other JVM languages especially attractive. Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure, for example, don&#x27;t feel much like Java, pursuing their own perspectives on what makes a good programming language.

Android Studio Bumblebee 作为一个新的大版本更新，其中包含许多新功能和改进。
支持 KMP 测试执行
现在可以在 Android Studio Bumblebee 使用 Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) 运行和测试。
为了确保 KMP 测试在 Android Studio 中成功运行，需确保项目满足以下所有要求：
AGP 7.0.0-alpha08 或更高版本
Gradle 6.8.2 或更高版本
Kotlin 插件 1.4.30 或更高版本
新设备管理器

设备管理器作为 AVD 管理器的替代品，为此也引入了一些新的功能，新添加的功能可以更方便地创建和管理所有本地测试设备，例如：
新的 UI 支持浮动或单独的窗口停靠在 IDE 上，就像使用其他 Android Studio 工具窗口一样，这样可以让开发者更轻松地访问自己的设备，而不会妨碍 IDE 的其他窗口。
Virtual tab 可以更方便地让开发者创建、管理和部署模拟器，更便捷地查看每个设备的详细信息，点击一下即可在 Device File Explorer 中快速检查设备。
Physical tab 可帮助开发者使用 ADB Wifi 快速配对新的设备，更便捷地查看每个物理设备的详细信息，另外你还可以通过单击按钮使用 Device File Explorer 快速检查每个设备的文件系统。
要打开新的Device Manager，可以执行以下操作之一：
在 Android Studio Welcome 中，选择More Actions &gt; Virtual Device Manager。

                    <span>「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。
在2021年末，酷狗发布了最新版11.0.0版本，这是一次重大的UI重构，更新完打开着实让我耳目一新。在原有风格上，整个App变得更加清爽，流畅。其中Tabbar的风格让我非常感兴趣，如果用Flutter来实现，或许是一个很有趣的事情。
效果图


分析效果
研究酷狗Tabbar的动画可以发现，默认状态下在当前Tab的中心处展示圆点，滑动时的效果拆分成两个以下部分:
从单个Tab A的中心根据X轴平移到Tab B的中心位置；
指示器的长度从圆点变长，再缩短为圆点。其中最大长度是可变的，跟两个Tab的大小和距离都有关系；
指示器虽然依赖Tab的size和offset来变换，但和Tab却基本是同一时间渲染的，整个过程非常顺滑；
总的来说，酷狗的效果就是改变了指示器的渲染动画而已。
开发思路
从上面的分析可以明确，指示器的滑动效果一定跟每个Tab的size和offset相关。那在Flutter中，获取渲染信息我们马上能想到GlobalKey，通过GlobalKey的currentContext对象获取Rander信息，但这必须在视图渲染完成后才能获取，也就是说Tab渲染完才能开始计算并渲染指示器。很显然不符合体验要求，同时频繁使用GlobalKey也会导致性能较差。
转变思路，我们需要在Tab渲染的不断把信息传给指示器，然后更新指示器，这种方式自然想到了CustomPainter【之前写了很多Canvas的控件，都是根据传入的值进行绘制，从而实现控件的变化了layout类】。在Tab updateWidget的时候，不断把Rander的信息传给画笔Painter，然后更新绘制，理论上这样做是完全行得通的。
Flutter Tabbar 解析源码
为了验证我的思路，我开始研究官方Tabbar是如何写的…</span>

                    <span>大家好，我是 Github 开源 GSY 系列项目的负责人郭树煜，比如 Android 上的 GSYVideoPlayer 就是这个系列里的项目，另外我也是 《Flutter 开发实战详解》 的作者，平时主要活跃在 Github 和掘金平台，这次主要是给大家分享移动端音视频开发和 GSYVideoPlayer 的一些有趣的内容。
基础知识
首先是基础知识，本次分享在这一块会占据很大比例，为什么要和大家聊音视频的基础知识？这就又要考古我很久前的一个经典 issue ，如图所示：

在维护 GSYVideoPlayer 这 5 年多的时间里，关于类似的基础的问题其实收到不少，只是这个比较典型，而处理这些问题的流程都是类似，举个例子，我收到最多的视频播放问题应该是
“播放黑屏，播放失败，xxx能播为什么GSY不能播？”
每次遇到这种问题的时候，我都会问：
“视频编码是什么？”
而很大概率我收到的回复就是 ：
MP4
之后就需要进一步去解释： “MP4 不是视频编码，要如何去查看视频编码...” 这样的一个流程。
所以关于音视频的基础常识，也是我最经常科普的内容，这部分内容其实也很多，这里就挑选一部分常见或者我比较经常解释的给大家分享。
封装

如图所示，一般情况下，视频流从加载到准备播放是需要经过解协议、解封装、解编码等这样的过程，其中：
协议指的就是流媒体协议；
封装是的是视频的封装格式；
编码又分为视频编码和音频编码；
常见的协议一般有 HTTP 、RTSP、RTMP 等，其中最常见的就是 HTTP 网络协议，而 RTSP 和 RTMP 一般用于直播流或支持带有控制信令的场景，比如远程监控；当然 HTTP 也有可以支持直播的，比如 HLS （也就是我们常见的 m3u8）。
视频封装协议指的是我们常见的 MP4 、AVI 、RMVB 、MKV、FLV 等常见后缀格式，它们所表示…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(0 min)</span>
                    <span>这次要重新测试一台机子，因为在上个月这台机子更新了一个重大功能，就是独显直连，这个功能算这台机子之前仅有的遗憾之一，也是不少发烧硬核用户特别关注的功能，所以这次特意借了一台机子更新测试，方便准备购机或者之前已购买的用户参考，这就是来自雷神的ZERO 英特尔酷睿版。

 
01/ 独显直连影响的不只是游戏
a.如何更新实现【独显直连】
雷神ZERO要实现【独显直连】功能，只能通过更新机子主板的【BIOS】（TP151或更新版）来实现，我这边简单说下整个流程供参考，具体也可以直接咨询官方技术客服。
1，更新BIOS：BIOS文件跟具体更新方式，直接咨询官方店铺客服或加官方群咨询管理员，按提示操作
2，确定更新成功后，关机，然后开机，开机过程反复按【F2】（不是一直按着）进入BIOS界面
3，进入BIOS界面后，方向键选择【advanced】菜单，第一个选项就可以选择独显模式为【Hybrid混合模式】或者【Discrete独显直连】，选择【独显模式】后，按【F10】保存退出，机子就成功切换为【独显直连】模式了。

开启【独显模式】之后，驱动界面就多了众多功能设置菜单

b.实现【独显直连】后有什么区别
如果你搜索【独显直连】，会告诉你这个功能主要影响是一些高帧数的竞技类游戏，比如FPS和MOBA类游戏，而对3A大型游戏影响不大，那么实际结果怎样，伴随这次更新，我顺带一起测试了【竞技类网游】、【3A大型游戏】、【GPU基准测试】跟【生产力应用】，综合看下这个功能带来的影响。
130W满血版RTX3060：雷神ZERO的性能释放算是挺大的优点，甚至可以说是TGL-H45+RTX30系列这一万金油组合的典范机型，无论CPU或者GPU或者组合功耗给的上限空间都算优异，比如GPU部分，专门针对 Dynamic Boost 2.0 进行了散热器的优化设计，既可以实现GPU130W满血释放，也…</span>

                    <span>月初，高中学校的体协指导老师联系我，问说下周日是否有时间来当个裁判？接力赛缺个裁判员。具体要求就是做技术支持，即时给出比赛数据，制作成绩证书。觉得难度不大，虽然没有学过 Excel，但是现学现卖应该是没有问题的。所以接下了这个 case，并开始了准备工作。
先说结果，34 个队伍，204 名运动员，没有人对比赛成绩提出疑议。相比起去年人工计算时差、排名算了几天的情况，今年在比赛结束后 30 分钟左右，就发出了所有成绩排名。相比起同类小型赛事，没有制作成绩证书。本次比赛给每位运动员都制作了成绩证书，部分跑友还将证书一并发在了朋友圈，或者微信群中，大家对这次的比赛满意度较高。
首先介绍一下赛事背景，因为这是一场马拉松接力赛，正常马拉松全程是 42.195 公里，如果把它办成一场接力赛。一个队伍 6 个人，每个人需要跑 7 公里。而在我们区里，正好有这样的一个 U 字形场地，来回一圈刚刚好是 7 公里左右。

裁判组会分为 3 组，每组裁判配 4 个人，3 个人分工按下秒表计时，1 个人摄像记录对应的队伍。所以这样就会生成两组数据，一组是计时时间，一组是对应的队伍名字。而我的工作，就是将这两组数据汇总对应起来，然后填入 Excel 表格中对应的位置，最后计算出相关的时差、配速数据。
表格制作
明确需求
基本情况介绍完了之后，再看看老师安排的需求：

因为报过来的是总时间，所以需要计算每名运动员的个人计时
然后自动求出每位运动员的配速
在比赛结束后，给出个人全体排名、团队排名、男子组排名、女子组排名
给每位运动员制作完赛成绩证书

设计表格
需求明确之后，就可以开始设计表格了。先填入所有需要记录的关键信息，如下图所示。

其中跑团战队名称、姓名、性别前面三项是固定的，在此之前已经通过其他表格收集了这些信息，所以现在要做的，就是将这三项信息复制进来，得到以下结果。

                    <span>作为一名重度数码发烧友来讲，我每天都会花很多的时间呆在我的书桌前摆弄各种数码产品。最近新房子装修完毕，各种家具都陆续到了我也开始我新桌面搭建的过程。这里也和大家分享一波从0到1的桌面搭建过程，也分享一下这一波我的新桌面都有哪些数码好物。
这次桌面搭建有了之前多次的经验所以在选择上有不少产品是我之前就一直在用的，这次搬入新家之后复购的产品。对我内容有印象的小伙伴应该对下面这个桌面有印象，这大概是2020年的时候在我原先家里卧室搭建的一套让我用了很久的桌面。当时的人体工学座椅就是网易严选之前的明星产品，被老罗卖爆了的网易严选经典款以及网易严选的电动升降桌面。

 
有了之前的良好体验，所以这次就复购了这款电动升降桌。毕竟之前附送免费上门安装、以及双电机的稳定体验都给我留下了深刻的印象。而且这次复购也没让我失望，当然如果现在网易严选这款电动升降桌可以推出一款更大尺寸的我就更开心了。毕竟相比网易严选的人体工学座椅的更新频率来讲，距离上次购买也一年多的时间了。这款网易严选的电动升降桌依旧也只有1.2m和1.4米、白色和胡桃色两种配色可选。在这个价格上都已经安排双电机了，为什么不升级一个1.6m甚至1.8m 桌面尺寸的版本给用户选择呢？

 
桌面清单：

主机：MBP 16.1 2019款+各种PC主机
显示器：明基PD2705U
充电设备：贝尔金108W四口氮化镓快充+15W苹果magsafe磁吸二合一无线充电器
灯光：飞利浦 Hue 照明组合
外设：海盗船RGB航海主题机械键盘+K65 RGB Mini+DARK CORE RGB PRO SE暗影（可以无线充电的无线鼠标）
桌面：网易严选电动升降桌 白色 1.4m*0.7m
座驾：网易严选星舰特别定制人体工学座椅（之前就有）

相比之前的桌面风格来讲，这次最大的变化可能就是 RGB 灯光元素的加入。自己一直很想做的就是给桌面增加…</span>

                    <span>序言
这一年和去年一样，在工作上并没有多少的起色，反倒是越睡越晚，不到3点完全不困。而当花了好几K在医院全身折腾了一遍，最终被诊断为神经衰弱后，你会发现或许平平淡淡也不错吧。然后就是强身健体，改变饮食节构，尽量早睡早起不熬夜。

这些唠叨其实和我接下来的内容没啥关系，只是提醒各位小伙伴要注意身体，少点外卖多泡脚。

接下来的内容源自前段时间有小伙伴在私下问，楼主，请问你桌面上的那个睡猫是啥？
见问的朋友多了，我就干脆开一篇小合集，解答这个睡猫的问题，顺便展示一下我手头用的一些小玩意，以及兼职型设计师的心头好物。


JXK嗜睡猫模型

我选的是三花猫，但居然有蛋蛋，在我印象中三花不是母的吗？感觉很特别。

模型使用树脂一体成型，开箱并无异味。表面的毛发细节相当优秀，不过也导致很容易沾染灰尘。脸部细节刻画很优秀，不过那胡子和眉毛是粘上去的，万千不要扯它。

平时没事就拿刷子给它刷一下，深夜工作时看着它睡得这么舒服，很想知道今晚它又梦见了什么。作为一个桌面摆件很值得入手，价格方面包含了底部的毛绒布垫。

5键够用，有线迷你键盘
并不是自嘲讽，而是真的只有5个键的迷你键盘。开始是考虑用3键就行了，毕竟也就Ctrl+C，再Ctrl+V，但感觉多个Ctrl+Z撤销会更好用，然后第5个键还可以加个ESC。

如果按价格来说，这迷你键盘并不便宜，一个键约9元左右，可以选青轴、红轴、茶轴、黑轴等各种轴体。当然，手感上面不要太过追求，但整体又相较普通键盘好用些。

5个键位可以通过软件自由调整，可以设定为任何键位，包括功能键、鼠标、媒体键和组合键，也就是说其实并不需要同时按下两个键，只单按一个键也可达成Ctrl+V的效果，只不过两个键更具仪式感。

光效方面支持按下点亮和跑马灯效，深夜使用时也还不错。

「快手饭」烹饪指南：即使熟悉的白米饭，也能做出新鲜感

🔋 充电量：125
作者：毛仔

人类种植稻米的历史起源于中国。大米作为市面上最常见也最为人所熟知的主食，经过数以千年记的发展、改良和创新，已经成为全球产量第二的食物。中国自古就有「鱼米之乡」等词汇，充分体现了大米对于中国百姓生活的影响。而法国名厨乔治斯·奥古斯特·艾斯可菲（1848–1935）也曾感叹：「米饭是世界上最好、最营养的——而且毫无疑问，它也是最普遍的主食。」由此不难看出，无论对于东方还是西方人，米饭都有着独特而浓厚的吸引力。
那么，作为一种看似平凡却又历史悠久的食物，我们又有哪些方法可以在家庭餐桌上折腾出新花样呢？今天本文就列举一些好吃又好看的碳水大餐！
阅读全文&gt;

编辑荐语（张奕源 Nick）：制作这篇内容期间，我派商城刚好上架了一款袁隆平大米，于是我便想到借此机会约作者制作一篇详谈大米烹饪的文章，最终就有了这篇米饭制作指南。
在打开文章之前，不少读者都以为文章只是单纯地讲怎么蒸大米的，实则不然。文中详细列举了大米的各种吃法，如煮粥、盖饭、包饭、炒饭等，每种做法都非常详尽，附有精美的配图。不仅如此，作者毛仔还充分考虑到了当代都市青年们没时间下厨的现实情…</span>

2022 年明星歌单推荐
王嘉尔：创作和收获

🎧 点击收听
2021 年对于王嘉尔来说是收获的一年，音乐创作中他和 Karencici、ICE、J.Sheon 组成 PANTHEPARK，并发行了首张专辑《The Park》，融合了嘻哈、电子等多种新潮的音乐元素，向外呈现出 C-Pop 新貌与文化自信的统一。

目前 S21 系列、Note 20 系列与 Z 系列第三代新品已经可以体验到新系统的完全体了，除了系统版本升级为 Android 12，One UI 4 还带来了大大小小接近 80 项功能更新。在这篇文章中，我将选取其中较为重要的变化，赶在 S22 系列到来之前，简单介绍一下 One UI 4 带来的新气象。
本文基于 Z Flip3 与国行 S21 写作，实际体验在不同机型可能有差异，以实际功能更新为准。

紧跟 Material You，但还是星味满满
One UI 的设计风格一向非常具有辨识度，经典的方圆形（Squircle）图标让人一看便知。但同时，它也能紧跟 Google 提出的各种新设计标准，比如 One UI 3 中引入的 Android 11 毛玻璃效果。本次 Android 12 在 Pixel 设备中引入的 Material You 主题取色系统也同样被 One UI 4 成功化用。

One UI 4 内置了一个名为「调色板」的功能，在设置壁纸之后会跳出提示，以自动取色的形式设置系统主题色。

经过测试，你目前可以在电话、计算器、联系人、设置、时钟、提醒、我的文件、信息和智能管理器内观察到全局颜色调整带来的改变。但由于目前 One UI 并未采用原生 Android 12 以色块为主的设计，因此自动取色最直观的结果只呈现在系统设置内的开关与系统应用在默认启动器内的图标颜色上，以及通知栏快捷开关的按钮、锁屏与 AOD 的时钟字体颜色——但是后面这些选项即使在前几个版本的 One UI 中也均可以通过系统设置手动调整，因此目前 One UI 4 所呈现的效果更像是主题颜色「自动化」。Pixel Launcher 中…</span>

上海又撞上疫情，连续三年春节不能回家，对父母始终有些亏欠。
昨天（春节前 10 天），收到微信的提示，提示使用定制红包封面。
突然发觉这是个好主意。不能回家，那帮父母做个红包封面。自己似乎也随着红包，跟父母一起给亲戚拜年。

红包封面的设计并不复杂，小白也能轻松设计。不过前提是，要有个 100 粉丝的视频号或公众号。
接下来介绍下，微信红包定制的整体流程。
红包封面额度
微信发了 2000 个红包封面，足够我帮家里每个人定制红包的。
值得注意的是，封面会在 2022 年 2 月 1 日 23:59 过期，只能在大年初二前使用。
微信红包团队的生意算盘太响了。这活动，不但给红包封面带来大量新用户，后期也能让不少人续费红包时间。

没用获取红包封面额度也没关系，可以自行购买。封面费用是 1 元/个，购买 n 个则 n 个用户可以使用此款红包封面，有效期半年。
封面平台注册
领取定制红包额度后，提示登录到 微信红包封面开放平台。
首次使用封面平台，需要注册并认证。如果你是用个人身份认证，注册中无付费环节。

个人认证，需要100粉丝的视频号或公众号。

注意，绑定的个人微信号需要实名认证。
红包封面设计
注册成功后，即可定制红包封面。
微信提供了 psd 和 sketch 的红包封面模板，流程参考 微信红包封面官方文档。
不懂设计模板能不能用？
可以的。
零基础用小画家，有图层概念则用 Figma。
不管工具如何，你上传图片，即可完成红包设计。
示例基础图片 (推荐手写字体：杨任东竹石体)
封面注意事项

红包封面会展示公众号名称和头像。名称一年可修改两次，头像一个月可申请修改 5 次。因为红包是给家人用的，不方便展示公众号信息。我选了个不用的公众号，把名称和头像都修改了。
红包审核需要 3 个工作日，距离春节也已经很近了。如果你想在春节使用定制红包，尽快申请审核三个红包封面，避免最后关头未通过。
如果微信红包封面中出现肖像，需要授权。拜年红包还是希望有全家福，我提交了资料，但通过几率不大。

完成后的红包：

                    <span>先说结论：
目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。


正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。
事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。
无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。
针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。
他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。
这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。
除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 
简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。


但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。
所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。
但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。
SAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: 

当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。
因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。
驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…
而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…
双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。

                    <span>本文首发腾讯视频NBA公众号。

      连续七个主场的赛程，对于全联盟主场战绩第一的勇士队来说并不轻松。首个主场比赛日他们就爆冷输给了缺少四大主力的步行者队，随后面对西部倒数第一的火箭队，他们也只是靠着库里职业生涯的第一个压哨绝杀才赢下比赛。





今天的犹他爵士队，过去的八场比赛输掉了六场，没有戈贝尔的时候他们遭遇了四连败。戈贝尔回来后，米切尔又因为对阵湖人队时脑震荡开始休战。本赛季有米切尔的时候爵士队每百回合得118.3分，能排在联盟第一，没有米切尔的时候爵士队每百回合只拿到109.7分，是联盟第十九的水平。坐镇主场迎战缺少了头号得分手的爵士队，勇士队还是赢面很大的。





果不其然，勇士队在大多数时间保持着比分上的领先，第四节爵士队的反扑非常凶猛，可勇士队还是靠着最后4分钟防的爵士队只进了一个三分，赢得了比赛的胜利。全联盟防守效率第一的勇士队靠着出色的防守，将对手命中率压制到38.3%赢球，听起来合情合理。可勇士队球迷怎么还是面带愁容呢？


现在的库里，生涯最铁


和爵士的整场比赛，库里一直没找到他的投篮准心，20投5中，在三分线外13投1中。上一场打火箭尽管有着最后的绝杀，可其实库里也只有21投6中。连续两场比赛命中率都不足30%，这种事儿居然发生在库里身上，怎么可能呢？



 其实就在本月初，连续对阵热火和独行侠的比赛中，库里就交出了17投3中，24投5中，合计41投8中的表现。两场球下来命中率不足20%，创下了他自己连续两场的最低命中率记录。





 美国媒体statmuse做了项库里的投篮数据统计：职业生涯库里单场20次出手以上，命中率最低的7场比赛，有6场都发生在本赛季。去年12月，库里的三分命中率只有37.4%，但是今年1月，库里的三分命中率已经跌破30%大关（117投35中，命中率29.9%）。

                    <span>将汽车轮胎按照地区分类，大致可以分为欧洲、北美、日韩、东南亚、中国。轮胎和所在地汽车工业息息相关，甚至间接决定了品牌定位。
典型如韩国，韩国汽车产品定位亲民家用，韩泰、锦湖也比较注重这方面。日本和美国是汽车老牌大国，两国汽车市场高度捆绑，所以两国轮胎品牌也主要以经济和越野为主。中国和东南亚地区的轮胎品牌，也都根据当地的汽车企业定位，诞生了比如玛吉斯、佳通、朝阳、玲珑等主要轮胎品牌。
欧洲有些不同的是，作为汽车的发源地，大量的运动赛事和跑车、豪华、家用、经济型汽车的全方位涉足，使得欧洲诞生了诸多性能顶级、品类全面的轮胎品牌，包括大家耳熟能详的德国马牌、米其林和倍耐力等。


选择合适的轮胎前，先搞清楚需求。
大多数轮胎品牌都有从上到下全面的布局，有经济、豪华、舒适、性能等各个系列，所以如果不是完全家用、经济趋向的车型，售价在15万以上，对操控、静音有些要求时就可以重点考虑欧洲品牌了。
问题是，一款轮胎不可能方方面面做到尽善尽美，如果有，那就是方方面面都不是最好。
如果在意成本，应该侧重考虑耐磨，但是耐磨一定程度上会影响舒适性和操控性，噪音也会增加。对于一些非入门车型来说有些得不偿失。出租车一般会倾向选择耐磨轮胎。
如果在意性能，比如领克03+、高尔夫GTI、宝马240i这一类的车子，需要重点考虑抓地力。抓地力好的轮胎可以有效提升车辆极限，相应的耐磨会变差。如果为了迁就耐磨，整车性能得不到发挥，事实上会造成更大的浪费。


如果是商务出行，比如别克GL8、奔驰V一类的车型，需要重点考虑舒适性。
如果是新能源车型或者豪华轿车，由于先天出色的静谧性或者对静谧性的高要求，应该侧重静谧性选择轮胎，以获得更加安静的乘坐感受。
有了需求就可以按图索骥选择产品了。多数汽车品牌有明确的系列划分，要理解一点都不困难，比如德国马牌旗下一共有三个大类：全能、运动和越野，命名规则是Conti-XXXX…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
笔者其实不太敢为陈朵作人物传记，因为陈朵的故事并不像一人之下作品中的其他人，可以作为普罗大众眼中比照自身的参考，她不同于张楚岚、诸葛青、王也这些普通人。
她是一个真正的“异人”，一个震撼人心的“人”。

陈朵的一生充满了各种崎岖坎坷，悲剧贯穿了她短暂的一生，但同时陈朵的人生又出离于普通人的生活，不论是作为她自己抑或是作为旁观者的我们都很难把陈朵归类普通人，她确实和这个世界格格不入，她是个“异类”。
只是她很幸运，能够在一群好人的守护下，幸运的活成我们看到的样子。
她也是个倒霉的孩子，无数次的机会她也可以不走向这样的结局。
但是陈朵的故事已经结束了，笔者觉得应该为她著书立说，盖棺定论。同时发生在她身上的诸多违和之处，也需要放在显微镜下仔细剖析。
最初她来到这个世界，是因为不得不来；最终她离开这个世界，是因为不得不走。——余华《活着》
起点：生而“异人”

如果说要在陈朵的悲剧里面找一个绝对的反派，那就一定是药仙会。
这个苗疆的会道门不愧是彻头彻尾的邪教组织。他们掳掠了各方面都极优秀的49个婴儿，从婴儿时期便以蛊毒喂食，在内脏种植蛊毒，还要抹除包括天性和人性在内的一切性情，最终用养蛊的方式让这49个孩子在自身蛊毒的厮杀间一一被淘汰，而最后唯一幸存者便是他们制造的所谓“蛊身圣童”。陈朵的这段过去正是她悲剧的起点，是至死都无法抹去的猩红底色。
2010年药仙会终于覆灭了，陈朵被公司“解救”出来，送入暗堡救治“改造”。
肉体的囚牢易解，心灵的枷锁难开。

药仙会的实验无疑是极为成功的，因为蛊身圣童完美的符合了他们设计实验之初的每一个要求，一个无视世间一切，只会制造蛊毒和接受指令的“工具”。
是的，工具，药仙会并不需要蛊童具有人的一切性情属性，甚至只需要开发出能够执行蛊身之术的理解力就够了。

就像那位血腥的资本家亨利福特的名言：“我需要的是一双手，为什么上帝给了我整个人”。…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
人物志系列停更许久，笔者本想先把陈朵人物志写完，但是思来想去，这个人物实在太火了，还是不凑那个热闹吧。
回望作品，笔者发现王也这个角色总能让人感触颇深，米二也愿意为他花费笔墨描绘他的人生轨迹，细腻之处甚至让笔者怀疑，王也就是米二理想中的自己。
他就像你我身边的一个朋友，在面上活得潇洒，混不吝，遇事有能量，有手段，年纪轻轻便走到了物质和精神两个层面的高峰。在骨子里他也温润如玉，豁达自在，哪怕怀璧其罪没有惶恐不安，哪怕力有未逮也始终放不下天下苍生， @天师道的白山正 说他和周圣合称”内圣外王“，这个”王“便是王也所行的王道。而在笔者看来，王也这个人物不仅仅是有其崇高的一面，他也有凡俗人的一面，相比“藏巧于贱”的张楚岚和“飞蛾扑火”的诸葛青，他向往逍遥世间的偷闲，也更是不愿沾染这世间的因果。
在笔者看来，王也其人，配得上”无为而无不为“一语。

生于安乐窝
王也作为中海集团老板王卫国的三公子，他的身家算得上出道即巅峰，投的一手好胎。
父亲的生意家大业大，父母还非常恩爱，生了三个儿子不够（王亦、王又、王也，瞧瞧这名字起的，啧啧啧），还想继续生闺女，甚至还有能助兴的蓝色小药丸，不得不说也总有一个幸福的原生家庭。

王卫国原型
此处有个小细节，王也的父亲叫做王卫国，出身行伍，上过边境，在部队里面也曾是吆五喝六的人物，其原型则是真实世界的两位牛人的混合体。
一位是王校长他爸，16岁就参军，17岁就到吉林省集安县的鸭绿江边成为了一名侦察兵，25岁就晋升排长进陆军学院进修，35岁则转业下海，62岁时登顶华人首富。这份经历和王卫国的人设不能说完全一致，只能说一毛一样。

另一位原型人物则是“玉帝专业户”，国家一级演员·真·王卫国。
先后在《西游记续集》、《宝莲灯》及《宝莲灯续集》中，饰演玉皇大帝一角，因此被广大观众熟知。有趣的是，正是因为王卫国扮演玉皇大帝的形象让人过目难忘，在以后的…</span>

                    <span>这题我熟。
还剩不到一周就过年了，虽然现在过春节不如小时候热闹，但心里总归还是有点小激动的（毕竟有假放）。
如果没有疫情，全家一起出门玩儿已经成为一部分人过年的方式。
我挺推荐过年去北京的，原因嘛自然是因为北京的年味儿浓，那些红墙已经把气氛拉满，再配上大街小巷里各种灯笼和糖葫芦，不用放刘德华的《恭喜发财》过年的感觉就出来了。


而且北方冬天有雪有冰，可以看冰灯会、玩滑雪、泡温泉，还有新年集市可以逛，能把新年过得很有实感。


今年年初四是冬奥会开幕式，不知道防疫政策会不会因此变得更加严格。不管如何还是想分享一下北京过年攻略，万一用得上呢。我估计原地过年的人也不在少数，这下正好可以好好感受京味儿十足的过年气氛。



去永宁古城赶个大集
永宁古城位于延庆，距市区大约2小时车程。它不是那种商业化的景点，里面的老建筑都是货真价实的，据说从唐代开始就有这座城了。



永宁古城之所以出名，也是因为这里每天都会有集市。平时的周末节假日就有不少特地来赶集的人，过年期间当然会更热闹一些。
集市和商店主要分布在主街上，卖啥的都有，爆米花、糖画、糖葫芦……集中看到这些东西，年味儿直接就扑到面前了。



淘货也赶集的乐趣之一，虽然主街不长，但各色摊位密集，从吃的到用的统统可以买到，价格也都不贵，正好可以采办些年货。周末的上午是最热闹的，建议大家安排好时间去玩。




对了，别忘了顺路吃古城最有名的小吃：火勺和豆腐。火勺有点像烧饼，但是会带一点椒盐味，中间夹肘子肉很好吃；永宁豆腐是用酸浆点的，加上这里水好，做出来的豆腐滑嫩又鲜美。



过年前后北京城的庙会和市集应该还挺多的，各位北京土著如果知道类似的集市欢迎留言安利。



去景区热闹过节
每年新年北京的几个景区都会有固定的活动，大家凑在一起热热闹闹地过节也不错，很适合带家人或是小朋友一起去玩。

                    <span>何为黑色电影之黑
法国影评人定义了黑色电影，他们从四十年代美国电影中归纳出这种风格。到五十年代末，奥逊·威尔斯执导的[历劫佳人]宣告了经典黑色电影时期的终结，随之而来的是所谓的新黑色电影——彩色取代黑白、黑色元素和主题融入某个类型化叙事中——犯罪、惊悚、科幻、恐怖等。黑色电影概念包含了一系列视觉和影像风格以及特定的主题——犯罪和荒诞。所谓黑色，既强调视觉，也强调叙事和主题。

从社会性源起来说，黑色电影是对二三十年代约翰·福特、弗兰克·卡普拉等导演所信奉的美国中产社会价值的反叛。底层、中产阶级、警察、女人等，或是陷入腐化堕落的罪恶环境，或是走向犯罪深渊。黑色电影虽然鲜少直接谈论宏大的政治、社会问题，但它们或多或少从这些问题中，产生了创作的冲动和灵感。源自人性的贪婪和腐败是导致主角犯罪或堕落的根本原因。
回看美国经典黑色电影，“黑色”之意并不难领略。它们大多是讲犯罪故事，或是与人性的阴暗面有关，让人感到既危险又迷人。主角只是普通人，而非穷凶极恶的帮派人物，或是被逼无奈的反抗者。
一般来说，1941年的[马耳他之鹰]在好莱坞刮起了黑色电影之风。从类型上来看，它是一部侦探电影，但具备了与该类型电影不同的黑色主题——不是聚焦于一般意义上的犯罪或悬疑解密，而是透过侦探之手，发现罪恶背后，道德和人性的失衡。

当侦探、女主和犯罪团伙的老大围在传说中用金子制作的马耳他之鹰周围时，他们的目光聚集了贪欲，但影片在此又狠狠黑色了一把：众人搭上几条性命，互相欺骗和斗争而争夺回来的宝物，却是一文不值的东西。
这种历经千帆后，被宿命击中的荒诞，亦是黑色电影迷人的地方。与女主暧昧的侦探，最终向警察告发了她的罪行。这是早期黑色电影的“保守”之处(因为海斯法典，好莱坞当时对性、变态、犯罪、暴力的表现还有很多禁忌)，摇摆的道德最后要回到正轨，作恶者自食其果。

You may have already noticed that we obsess over user experience in places where humans meet APIs. And we like to simplify things, a lot.

Pointer cursors were invented to indicate links on the Web. It is tempting to adopt them for all active elements in apps that use web technologies, like we initially did. However, after a thorough research, we decided to say goodbye to pointer cursors.
Speaking of design: we—and our beta users—didn’t like the default title bar in the desktop app. It wasted space and didn’t fit our custom design – the entire window should blend in with the app’s personality. And now, starting with macOS, it does:

                    <span>Like most fast-growing companies, LinearB spends WAY too much time trying to hire developers.
So when we came across a brilliant article about hiring autistic talent, we knew we had to have its author Matt Nigh on the podcast. Matt is one of the most prominent thought leaders on neurodiversity in the workplace.
Matt himself was diagnosed with autism late in life following a very unique job interview at Google. He’s since spent countless hours researching, writing and talking about how companies can not only bring neurodiverse talent into the fold, but why engineering teams thrive when they do.
In this episode of Dev Interrupted we talk with Matt about best practices in recruiting, hiring and working with neurodiverse coders, how his interview at Google interview led to an autism diagnosis, the ways Matt’s data team at the University of Washington is helping combat COVID and what private companies can learn from the ROI metrics of universities and public institutions.
Dan and Matt also took some time to geek out about GitLab.
We hope this conversation was as enlightening for you as it was for us and we hope it helps you find your next great hire.

                    <span>The Basics


Ethereum is a network of computers which collectively form the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which updates the state of the Ethereum blockchain. A blockchain is a publicly available and distributed database, which acts as the memory of the EVM. One role of this memory is acting as a ledger, saying who owns how much Ether, the cryptocurrency supported by the Ethereum network. The computers participating in this network are called “nodes” or “miners”, and the computational power they contribute is what keeps the EVM running. For their work, they are rewarded with Ether, hence the term “miners”. The EVM can also run programs called “smart contracts”, which are programs stored on the blockchain and run on the EVM.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever taken a fitness class, you&#x27;ve heard the instructor talk about consistency. It&#x27;s not about how fast you pedal or how much weight you lift. It&#x27;s about showing up, doing your best and not giving up. Regularly.
It&#x27;s the same for your brain. If you are learning a new framework, a new programming language, or working on a side project to expand your skills, you are much better off doing a small amount every day, or several times a week, as opposed to bingeing. When I hear a friend say something like &quot;I&#x27;m dedicating this coming weekend to learning React&quot; I cringe because I fear they will go back to their day job and forget everything from the weekend by the next weekend. 
But don&#x27;t take my word for it. The science backs this up.

                    <span>Hey again, all! 
If you frequent DEV Community or have ordered from our shop, you have likely seen me around. I originally joined the DEV Team in June of 2019 as a Business Development and Growth Intern. Although I had been an intern for some time, my colleagues have always respected me as a significant part of the team through-and-through. 
Two-and-a-half years later, I graduated from The College of New Jersey with my Bachelor&#x27;s in English. Now, I&#x27;m becoming a part of the DEV Team full-time as a Developer Marketing Associate! It&#x27;s a really exciting change and I&#x27;m looking forward to every part of it. 
Between work and school, I have not had a lot of time to improve my programming skills and engage with the community on a personal level. I hope to change this over the course of the next few months. I&#x27;m certain you will all be seeing more of me as I tackle this new position. Wish me luck!
If you have any questions or comments — or just want to chat — don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out! Shoot me an email or a DM on the DEV Community Discord (Where I&#x27;ll be waaaaay quicker to respond to you. Join if you haven&#x27;t yet!).</span>

                    <span>TL;DR — Falso is a modern, tree-shakeable, well-documented replacement for Faker.js
You probably know what happened to Faker.js around two weeks ago.
In collaboration with Netanel Basal, I created a new mock data generator lib to provide a quick, suitable replacement for those relying on Faker (including us).
✅ 160+ Functions ( at the time of writing)
There was a lot of community effort put into building this library. In just two weeks, we accomplished:
✨ A whopping 1.6k Github Stars
I want to thank everyone who took part in this, you rock!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve worked in a scrum team for a while, and later I saw other developer teams working in an old school way. Here are things I&#x27;ve noticed.
senior developers aren&#x27;t approachable, working in silos. Many cases don&#x27;t show up for weeks. 


junior devs onboarding lasts feom 6 months to a year, and after that still have gaps in knowledge about product.


developers chase each other on chat for bugs introduced. Changes therfore reverted including improvements.


Developers work on ad-hoc tasks, interrupted by client support with nonsense issues.


client support has no understanding of iasues and can&#x27;t replicate it befoee pasaing on to devs.


clients calling developers on the phone.


dev team manager coding


no version control. Backups restored, changes lost, task solved become unresolved.


tickets contain multiple tasks, often left halfway done and closed.


templates arent updated as per latest data changes, old code commented out, duplicate codes.


developers aren&#x27;t aware what the rest of the team is working on. 



I&#x27;m not saying this is bad, it&#x27;s not wfficient. Junior take a long time to -if ever- understand the whole project and their skills remain unexploited. Validity of development can only be seen when task is completed, so if it&#x27;s worthless, then all the time and work went down the toilet. The product isn&#x27;t evolving, only the codebase becomes larger.</span>

Best Practices for Designing an Interface
1.Keep the interface simple
2.Create consistency and use common UI elements
3.Be purposeful in page layout
4.Strategically use color and texture
5.Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity
6.Make sure that the system communicates what&#x27;s happening
7.Think about the defaults.

                    <span>PostgreSQL sunucusu varsayılan ayarlarla kurulduğunda uzaktan bağlantıya kapalı olarak kurulmaktadır. Sadece kendisi üzerinden localhost(127.0.0.1) üzerinden 5432 portundan haberleşebilmektedir. Bunu tüm ağlar üzerinden veya spesifik ağlar üzerinden erişilecek şekilde açabilirsiniz. 
Uzaktan bağlantıya izin verilmesi için, /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf dosyası içinde aşağıdaki satır düzenlenmesi gerekiyor: (normalde başında diyez var içinde de localhost yazıyor)
listen_addresses &#x3D; &#x27;*&#x27;

Uzaktan bağlantı sağlayacak IP adresi veya IP adreslerinin bulunduğu ağ için /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf dosyasının en alt satırlarında bir yere aşağıdaki satır eklenmeli.
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

Bu satır eklendiğinde tüm ağlardan erişim sağlanabileceği gibi, güvenlik olarak sadece istenilen IP adresi veya ağ adresi yazılması daha uygun olacaktır.
Tüm işlemler sonucunda postgresql servisini yeniden başlatmak yetecektir.
sudo systemctl restart postgresql

Bu adımla birlikte uzaktaki herhangi bir SQL istemcisinden PostgreSQL sunucusuna sorgu atılabilmektedir.</span>

                    <span>Hi! Been a minute, but I&#x27;m back with another CSS tutorial!
This one will be pretty quick, but should give you a great launch point for extrapolating and creating something special.
Now you probably know that you can add borders to specific sides of an element, using, for instance:
.border-top {
    border-top: 1px solid white;
}

Result:

But what you may not realize, is what happens when you add a very simple additional property: border-radius! Now, maybe this sounds super obvious, but just how cool it is, isn&#x27;t obvious until you see it in action, so let&#x27;s do that:
.border-top-round {
    border-radius: 50%;
    border-top: 1px solid white;
}

Result:

Cool, isn&#x27;t it? No?
Well let&#x27;s make it so!
If the first bit wasn&#x27;t all that impressive, maybe adding a little fun and flare should do the trick.
Check it out!




So what&#x27;s the code for this one? Grab it here (it&#x27;s free!):

                    <span>Getting the security right in applications is tricky. Most developers did not undergo professional security training and are not adept in such topics. At least I know I&#x27;m not.
Luckily, multiple tools can help us achieve a relatively good security posture. Snyk, CodeQL and GitGuardian are good examples.
In some cases, even a deployment framework can be helpful. This blog post will expand on this topic, looking at how a particular feature of AWS CDK can help us enforce compliance of various resources we deploy to AWS.
Enter AWS CDK Aspects.

                    <span>“Introverts don’t shout at the world, they listen!”
The day I learned the word “introvert”, I finally understood myself completely. I had spent my entire day reading, researching, and taking every test on introversion. Finally, I understood why I don&#x27;t fit in with most of my friends, why I enjoy my own company most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with me. 
I grew up in a &quot;culture of personality&quot; where everything is designed to cater to extroverts. For example, we were always encouraged and rewarded for working together, speaking up, or asking questions in schools. Likewise, we were promoted and rewarded for marketing ourselves with outgoing personalities at workplaces. Sometimes, we had to pretend to be extroverts in order to fit into the system.

                    <span>Introduction 😊


Today we are diving into a particularly interesting program. We will be discussing link preview.
For long ago I&#x27;ve been noticing on some social media and apps a small preview of what awaits us in case we click or decide to follow the link, and others not having anything to preview. This has caused a set of variations on the different aspects of this link preview. Without turning around the boring story, let&#x27;s go through our program.
Whenever on social media you add a URL, or when you receive an email message with a URL in the body, you&#x27;ll see a rich preview that includes a link title, thumbnail image, domain, and description of the link. This is called a link preview. 
Below is a clear example of such.



  
  
  History of the link🧓

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever used conditionals in your code you&#x27;ve seen if statements, and if you&#x27;ve seen if statements you&#x27;ve seen them nested several layers deep. In your personal project this could be simply annoying and cause problems down the road but in production code this can be really problematic. 
    The ternary operator, ?:, is one Question Mark operator and a feature in some programming languages that makes conditional statemnts cleanier and easier to read. The basic syntax goes like this:
condition ? if true : else;

In use this would look like this:
const foo &#x3D; true ? 1 : 0;

In this snippet, foo is 1, since the condition is true, and true is (obviously) a truthy value.
If you&#x27;re not sure what truthy/falsy values are just think of it this way:

                    <span>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about putting my static sites on servers
that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub
Pages.
Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of
maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind
of maintainance their servers require, and
they convinced me that it might not be that bad.
So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see
what it was like.
Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did
anyway because there are a surprising number of decisions and I like to see
what choices other people make.
the constraint: only static sites
To keep things simple, I decided that this server would only run nginx and
only serv…</span>

                    <span>以后可以在 Linux 应用中看到（很多）广告了

Qt 宣布支持客户端应用程序中的广告，应用程序开发人员现在可以在桌面应用程序中提供 广告服务，而这通常是 Windows 用户的待遇。Qt 被广泛使用在桌面应用程序开发中，KDE 就是基于 Qt 框架开发的。虽然估计不会在 KDE 的核心应用程序中看到广告，但有可能一些急于挣钱的发行版会将这些应用程序分叉，在其中放置广告。根据其文档，该广告插件支持所有主流平台，包括 Windows 和 Linux 等等。


老王点评：这个消息让我一时不知道该怎么说，一方面确实可以补贴一些开源开发团队，另外一方面充斥着广告的 Linux ，怎么都感觉不对劲。




自毁代码库的作者要求恢复其发布到 NPM 的能力

Faker.js 的原作者在 自毁 了其两个重要的开源代码库之后，GitHub 和 NPM 一度封禁了他的账户并回滚了其提交的恶意版本。之后 GitHub 恢复了他的账户，而一些社区贡献者 复刻 了他的 Faker.js 项目，并提出了积极的发展路线图。而该作者在 Twitter 上 抱怨称，GitHub 取消了他向 NPM 发布和修复错误的能力，一直没有恢复。他称其还有一百多个包要维护，并委婉地承认了错误：“每个人都会时不时地犯编程错误。没有人是完美的。”


老王点评：公平的讲，虽然该作者的行为不合情理，但是 GitHub 和 NPM 也没有强行封禁的权利和理由。




Linux 供应商固件服务考虑为老旧设备提供开源固件

开发者提议，由 Linux 供应商固件服务（LVFS）这样的实体为已经过了保修期的硬件提供自由开源的固件。这涉及到一些法律问题，而且这样的举动可能不会得到硬件供应商的认可。到目前为止，由于法律要求、良好的安全模式等原因，LVFS 完全依赖于 ODM/OEM 为其硬件上传固件。对于没有经验的用户来说，通常不是很容易自己操作闪存。而采用 LVFS 可以使你更容易地关闭系统的专有固件，并在支持的情况下切换到自由固件。如果用户接受采用第三方固件的风险，这样也为挽救过保的硬件提供了可能。


老王点评：我觉得这是一种有益的尝试。</span>

                    <span>Linux 有助于弥合数字鸿沟，延长硬件的使用寿命，使得它成为操作系统的一个环保选择。




与大流行病作斗争，造成了生产新电脑所需的微芯片的短缺。此外，一些较新的专有操作系统提高了它们的硬件标准（LCTT 译注：Windows 11，别扭头看别人）。这个难题为我们这些在日常生活中使用 Linux 的人创造了一个机会。

延长硬件的生命周期

长期以来，Linux 一直以延长老旧硬件的寿命而闻名。这种能力对那些每天使用电脑的人来说是个福音。

在过去的一年里，我已经帮助许多人使用 Linux 翻新和 改装旧电脑。基于 Linux 的电脑耗电更少，启动速度更快。Gnome 桌面很好，但许多旧电脑更适合 LXDE 或 XFCE 环境，它们运行需要较少的资源。

像 FreeGeek 和 Kramden Institute 这样的组织已经把弥合数字鸿沟作为他们的核心使命，并以此为目标。这些团体对旧电脑进行了再利用，使它们不被当成垃圾填埋，而是把它们送到需要它们的用户手中。没有 Linux，就没有这些项目。

DD-Wrt、OpenWrt 和 Tomato 都是 Linux 解决方案，使旧的网络硬件不被当成垃圾丢弃，并同时为用户的路由器提供更多的安全、隐私和性能。

借助 GalliumOS 和 Mrchromebox.tech，即使是 Chromebooks 在谷歌停止支持后也能获得新的生命。

新的机会

Linux 创造了一些本来不存在的机会。学生和业余爱好者都在没有投资的情况下开始了计算机科学的成功事业，这要归功于他们在旧电脑上学到的经验。这些系统运行企业级软件，如 LAMP 栈，它促进了向 “Web 2.0” 的过渡。它是最早的 Web 开源软件栈之一。今天，它为 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla 系统提供了动力。事实上，Linux 为超过 96% 的世界前 100 万台 Web 服务器提供动力。Linux 还管理着 嵌入式系统、电子阅读器、智能电视、智能手表 等等。Linux 是世界上远远 超过 70% 的智能手机的操作系统。甚至美国国家航空航天局（NASA）今年在火星上创造历史的 毅力号，也是由 Linux 驱动的。

为当今大多数应用提供动力的云计算，没有 Linux 就不可能存在。今天的大多数 Web 和智能手机应用都在基于 Linux 的 容器 中运行。即使在微芯片短缺和专有系统成本高昂的情况下，进入云服务行业的人也有机会学习开源的操作系统和软件。

未来

但最恰当的是，Linux 和开源为 联合国可持续发展目标 提供了动力。随着大流行的继续，Linux 仍然是一个重要的资源。

                    <span>CrowdSec 门卫被设计成可以包含在任何 PHP 应用程序中，以帮助阻止攻击者。




PHP 是 Web 上广泛使用的一种编程语言，据估计有近 80% 的网站使用它。我在 CrowdSec 的团队决定，我们需要为服务器管理员提供一个 PHP 门卫，以帮助抵御那些可能试图与 PHP 文件互动的机器人和不良分子。

CrowdSec 门卫可以在应用栈的各个层面上进行设置：Web 服务器、防火墙、CDN 等等。本文关注的是另外一个层次：直接在应用层面设置补救措施。

由于各种原因，直接在应用程序中进行补救是有帮助的：


它为潜在的安全威胁提供了业务逻辑上的答案。

它提供了关于如何应对安全问题的自由。


虽然 CrowdSec 已经发布了一个 WordPress 门卫，但这个 PHP 库被设计成可以包含在任何 PHP 应用中（例如 Drupal）。该门卫有助于阻止攻击者，用验证码挑战他们，让人类通过，同时阻止机器人。

先决条件

本教程假定你在 Linux 服务器上运行 Drupal，并使用 Apache 作为 Web 服务器。

第一步是在你的服务器上 安装 CrowdSec。你可以用 官方安装脚本 来完成。如果你使用的是 Fedora、CentOS 或类似系统，请下载 RPM 版本：

$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.rpm.sh


在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上，下载 DEB 版本：

$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.deb.sh


这些脚本很简单，…</span>

「2022 年什么会火？什么该学？本文正在参与“聊聊 2022 技术趋势”征文活动 」
Android 诞生已久，其开发方式保持着高频更迭，相较于早期的开发方式已大不相同，尤其是近几年 Google 热切推崇的 MAD 开发技术。其实很多开发者已经有意或无意地正在使用这门技术，借着 2022 开年探讨技术趋势的契机，想要完整地总结 MAD 的愿景、构成、优势以及一些学习建议。
MAD，全称 Modern Android Development：是 Google 针对 Android 平台提出的全新开发技术。旨在指导我们利用官方推出的各项技术来进行高效的 App 开发。有的时候 Google 会将其翻译成现代安卓开发，有的时候又翻译成新式安卓开发，个人觉得前者的翻译虽然激进、倒也贴切。
下面按照 MAD 的构成要点逐步展开，帮助大家快速了解 MAD 的技术理念。如果大家对其中的语言、工具包或框架产生了兴趣，一定要在日后的开发中尝试和掌握。

瑞典小哥里克真名：Nagualero（纳瓜莱罗），我转载过他的近20个视频，虽然少，流量也一般，但我个人一直认为里克是最为寻求荒野宁静原始风格的视频拍摄者，露营，绘画，音乐，多才多艺，我非常喜欢他的风格。

                    <span>为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。
我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。
为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。
短信转发至 iPhone 效果
在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App
🔗 下载地址：App Store
Bark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 &gt; Bark 服务端 &gt; 苹果 APNs 服务器 &gt; 你的设备 &gt; Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。
第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。
Bark App
在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder
🔗 下载地址：酷安
SmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。
打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。
将Bark设置为发送通道
返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。
设置短信转发规则
除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。
为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️
出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。
示例：realme UI 后台权限设置
出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。
realme UI 验证码安全保护
将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac
根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。
总结
得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。
如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。

                    <span>写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢 「用产品思维解构生活」 的花生酱，也可以叫我 Jeff。
我至今正式写作了6年，看上去是蛮不错的坚持成果，但老实说，最近1年我才开始喜欢自己的文章，也是在最近1年，我才找到自己“高效产出文章”的效率写作之道。
效率写作是个复杂的旅途，途中险象环生。
缺乏灵感和选题会让我们放弃，自说自话会让我们找不到读者，拾人牙慧会让我们迷失自我。这些复杂的难题，每一个都足够成为效率杀手，吞没我们的写作生涯。我也是花了5年时间，才逐一和解，摸索到我今日能安于写作的状态。
所以，我试图用这篇文章探讨：谈及写作，我们如何从入门、坚持再到高效。
希望诸君无需5年弯路，都能找到自己的效率写作之道。
 
粗放写作的利与弊
20221月我的少数派数据
2016年的我，从未想过自己能有幸发表文章被几万人阅读。
彼时，我带着不屑与傲慢开始写作，尝试去解答一些诸如“产品经理能力模型”的宏大命题。结果是，我被社区拒稿了4次，进而，巨大的恐慌和质疑包围着我。当时被拒绝的原因诸如：1.文章结构不符合金字塔思维；2.内容不够深度...
但我都不能完全地理解、修正，甚至自己完全看不出问题。
这种不理解，进一步引发了自我怀疑。
每天我都在想，我是不是不适合写作，我写的东西是不是太啰嗦了，或许我当前的能力不足以写产品话题，我该沉淀两年再等等？但对于这些问题，我并没有能力第一时间找到答案---否则就不会被拒绝4次了。
总之，我带着诸多疑问和拙劣的技巧，在自尊心的驱使和责任编辑的指引下，开始不断修改。第5次能够成功，其实并不是改得多好，而是靠坚持不懈。被拒绝带来的挫败和质疑激发了我的斗志，完全出于“洗脱被拒绝现状”的自尊心，让我坚持改稿。或许是不小心改到了要求的水准，或许是这种坚持一定程度上感动了编辑，历时2个月，终于发布。
就这样，这种“出于自尊心”的坚持，在头两年成为了我写作的源动力，甚至是唯一…</span>

PhoneCast：将你的 iPhone 屏幕投射到 Mac 上

平台：iOS / iPadOS / macOS
关键词：投屏、演示

@化学心情下2：PhoneCast 是一款可以将iOS 设备屏幕投射到 Mac 上的工具，其原理也很容易理解——通过 iOS 内置录屏功能将画面录制并直播，而 Mac 端则通过接收并回放的形式在桌面通过窗口展示出来，从而间接的实现了 iOS 屏幕投射到 Mac 上。

操作上也不复杂，在 iOS 端和 Mac 端分别安装 PhoneCast，Mac 作为接收端只需要运行并放置到后台即可，而 iOS 端只需要在首页中点击 Power to Start boradcast，之后在「直播屏幕」中选中 Phonecast 后点击 「开始直播」，等待直播开始后即可将 Phonecast 放到后台运行；如果 Mac 和 iPhone 处于同一个局域网，那么你会很快在 Mac 桌面看到一个显示 iOS 桌面的窗口，你在 iOS 上的操作都会同步在 Mac 上的这个小窗口显示。

当然这样直接的投射虽然能用上，但你可以看到画面并不清晰，因此你也可以通过解锁内购的方式来开启高画质投屏，对应地你还可以通过购买订阅的方式来开启所有高级功能，比如说自动根据手持方向旋转投屏的画面，只投射声音等等。而在开启高画质之后，则需要注意…</span>

                    <span>虽然近些年遭受了不少争议，但对大多数人来说，高考还是大家接触广阔世界，追求自身理想的第一步。
在完成考试离开象牙塔之后，接下来面临的就是选报学校和专业的问题。和十几年前相比，现在报选学校的流程已经人性化了许多，至少可以把确认学校的时间放在分数公布之后，省去了估算分数的麻烦，也避免了很多高分低走和被迫滑档甚至复读的痛苦。
但这样的设计只能解决「选上学校」的问题，相比之下，要在高考结束之后选择自己未来几年走向的专业科系才是更大的麻烦。目前，大部分学校的转专业体系仍然不太完善，无论是采用高考分数筛选、额外设置考试还是其他特殊规则，转专业制度仍然不能满足所有人的需求。
而且，由于对自身追求探索和实际生活阅历的双重不足，有不少人在实际深入大二甚至更晚的专业课程后才能发现，那个在家人、老师等等「参谋」之下选定的「好专业」根本不适合自己。错过本科的转专业考试之后，无论跨专业考研还是选择与自身专业相去甚远的工作，需要面对的精神压力和沉没成本都成倍增加，不少人在这样的衡量中逡巡不前，无法抉择。
作为曾经跨专业考研成功的人，我觉得或许有必要讲讲改换专业的故事。我找到了一些朋友，他们有的本科参加了转专业考试，有的选择了跨专业考研，有的在毕业后选择了与专业不同的工作。希望这些故事和经历，可以在你想做出这样的重大决策时，或多或少地提供一些帮助。

手机虚拟机是什么？
手机虚拟机，用过电脑虚拟机的听到应该也不会陌生，其实就是内置在手机本体内的又一个系统。它虽然是模拟真机环境，但与本机系统最大的区别在于：你拥有对该系统的自主掌控权，也就是常说的「自带 root」或者「免 root」，多用于软件测试（包括安装非官方渠道应用）和应用多开。

提到这里，不免要区分下云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机。
云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机的区别
云手机：运行在 ARM 架构（适用于移动通讯领域）的服务器上，性能由服务器决定，用户需要通过远程访问云手机操控，不影响本机系统，但也存在网络延迟现象。
Android 模拟器：其实与手机虚拟机类似。Android 模拟器运行在电脑端，需要通过键盘鼠标来操控。对于习惯手游的用户来说，除特殊需求，使用频率并不算高。
手机虚拟机：运行在手机内，占用手机内存和运算能力，因而手机性能的高地直接决定了虚拟机的运行流畅度，优势是共享真机网络。
三者各有优势，加上成本因素（包括金钱和操作）来考量的话，倾向使用手机虚拟机的人越来越多。毕竟对于生活玩家来说，一台手机上就能免费完成应用多开、软件测试的需求，何乐而不为。
常见的手机虚拟机有哪些，优缺点是什么？
真机性能越好，虚拟机运行才会越流畅，类比在手机里运行的游戏应用。这几年各大手机厂商都在疯狂给手机加配置，又正是洞察到了我们的需求。
市场上主流的三款虚拟机也都一一使用过一段时间（仅以酷安上的数据为参照）。

VMOS Pro、光速和 51 虚拟机，三者其实大同小异，最受欢迎的多开，悬浮窗，挂机等…</span>

美联储发布报告讨论数字货币利弊

1 月 20 日，美国联邦储备委员会发布了关于数字货币的研究报告。这份题为《货币与支付：数字转型时代的美元》（Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation）的报告原定于去年夏天发布，目的在于征求公众意见，为美联储决定是否发行央行数字货币提供参考。
报告指出，数字美元（CBDC）可以从根本上改变美国金融体系的结构，改变私营部门和中央银行的角色和责任，具有确保美元在国际金融体系中继续维持领先地位、改善跨境支付、增加金融包容性并简化美元在新技术中的使用等好处。同时，报告也对可能产生的负面影响发出了警告，包括夺走传统银行业的存款，挤兑金融公司、隐私保护和打击非法融资等问题亟需考虑等。
但是，这份报告没有提出政策建议，也没有就是否支持推出数字美元发出明确信号。美联储强调，在没有白宫和国会明确支持的情况下，它不会采取进一步行动。目前，美联储官员内部对于数字美元的立场存在分歧。
此外，1 月 21 日，俄罗斯央行也发布了一份关于加密货币的报告，加密货币可能破坏国民经济，增加监管机构维持货币政策的难度；因此，建议政府立法禁止加密货币相关活动。来源

在中国人的食谱中，烧烤是最特殊的存在。代表餐桌审美的川、鲁、粤、淮扬等大菜系里，几乎找不到烧烤的影子。无论是川菜里的开水白菜、麻婆豆腐；鲁菜里的葱烧海参、九转大肠；粤菜里的白切鸡、豉汁排骨；淮扬菜里的狮子头、大煮干丝。它们的共同点是，以蒸、煮作为最上档次、最政治正确的烹饪方式，炒次之，煎、炸再次之。而烧烤，则在被默认为是不上台面、不能用于高级食材的烹饪方式——中餐烹饪鄙视链的底端。



与这种观念截然相反的是，在几乎所有的中国城市、乡村中，烧烤是人人青睐、家家热爱的好物。无论宵夜小酒、露营户外、好友聚会或者阖家团圆，只要一炉烧烤镇场，那就有了氛围和排面。
不能处庙堂之高，则居江湖之远；不能赏炊金馔玉，则谋锦绣膏粱。烧烤，代表了中国饮食最草莽、最市井、最家常和最温情的那一面，也凝聚了中国人所有的因地制宜、圆融变通、行侠好义和林下风致。

烧烤的历史，远远早于其他烹饪方式。炖煮需要防水耐火的容器、蒸需要容器里加装隔水装置、煎炸需要食用油的榨取技术，但烧烤却什么都不用：几根树枝，一堆火，就能让腥膻的生肉，变成油花四溢，香气扑鼻的烤肉。也许在没有文字的时代，烧烤已经成为人们告别茹毛饮血的捷径。

但严格说来，“烧”和“烤”两个汉字，含义并不相同。《说文解字》对“烧”的释义是一个更复杂的字“爇”。从字形理解，就是捂在草堆下加热。



今天，在云南滇西地区还存在着一种古老的美食“火烧肉”，当地人有时又称之为“大烧”。制作很简单，把整猪肉埋入柴草堆里，点燃，慢慢等待火焰燃烧、熄灭。然后洗掉猪皮表面烧焦的地方，剩下半生不熟的猪肉切薄片后凉拌吃。



不能吃生的外地人，可以只要较熟的外层，而本地人则更倾向于连生带熟一起吃。不是这个，不够鲜嫩滑爽。无疑，这是古老的“烧”保存至今的饮食活化石，也是汉语、…</span>

There are a wealth of resources online such as this claiming that in JavaScript primitive values are allocated on the stack while objects are allocated on the heap. This idea is false, at least this is not how the language is implemented in the majority of JavaScript engines I have seen. I am typing in this post so that I can link to it and save myself some time in the future.
All JavaScript values are allocated on the heap accessed by pointers no matter if they are objects, arrays, strings or numbers (except for small integers i.e. smi due to pointer tagging).

                    <span>发现植入到 UEFI 固件中的恶意程序

研究人员通过固件扫描器的日志发现了一个 植入 到 UEFI 固件中的恶意程序 MoonBounce。该扫描器自 2019 年初以来已被整合到卡巴斯基产品中。恶意程序修改了主板上的 SPI 闪存，它不在硬盘上，因此格式化硬盘或更换硬盘不会清除恶意程序。修改后的固件镜像允许攻击者拦截引导序列的执行流，引入一个复杂的感染链。由于感染链只在内存中运行，而在硬盘上没有留下攻击痕迹。该恶意程序可以部署用户模式的恶意软件，从互联网上下载并执行的更多的有效载荷。


老王点评：真是无孔不入，这些恶意程序真是能别开生面的发现利用方法。




FSF 让其 5000 多名准会员提名董事会成员

自由软件基金会（FSF）董事会前几天通过了 新程序，在其 37 年的历史上，第一次可以让其准会员提名其董事会成员。FSF 打算在 2022 年利用这些新程序首先增加几个新董事，然后开始对现有董事进行审查。包括所有现任董事在内的有投票权的成员可以参与投票。FSF 主席说：“向我们的准会员开放董事招聘程序是 FSF 的一个历史性的、受欢迎的里程碑。”该流程是由顾问主导的六个月审查的主要成果。


老王点评：作为开源先锋，FSF 能践行社区治理是一个进步。




Linux 大量向用户提供了固件更新

本周早些时候，在上传了许多新的系统固件文件后，Linux 供应商固件服务提供了大量下载服务。这些固件解决的问题尚未披露，似乎是一个“高度严重的即将到来的安全问题”，但据分析是在更新英特尔 CPU 的微代码。经过 测试发现，无论新的安全问题是什么，它似乎都没有任何广泛的性能影响。


老王点评：在这种时候，就感觉到了 Linux 供应商固件服务的重要性。

2021 年，我们发表了远超 150 篇的 Linux 方面的文章。从桌面 Linux 用户小工具的文章到将 Linux 作为服务器操作系统的教程，以及介乎于两者之间的各种场景，这些文章已经涵盖了 Linux 生态系统的许多方面。所有这些文章都值得你花时间去阅读，但你可以从今年发表的这十篇好文章开始阅读。

3 个开源工具，使 Linux 成为理想的工作站

在这篇文章中，Seth Kenlon 介绍了 LibreOffice、AbiWord、Gnumeric 和 Pandoc，涵盖了 使 Linux 成为理想工作站的工具。他解释了在使用 Linux 作为桌面操作系统时，这些应用程序如何使你的工作效率提高。文章探讨了一些高级功能，如 LibreOffice 的无头模式，并提供了如何充分利用每个应用程序的小技巧。

为什么我在 Linux 上使用 exa 而不是 ls

ls 命令是 Linux 中最常用的终端命令之一，但你知道它有一个现代的替代品，提供了许多有益的改进吗？Sudeshna Sur 的 文章 介绍了 exa 命令以及它相比 ls 的优势，讨论了 exa 如何跟踪添加到 Git 仓库的新文件、显示目录和文件树等等。

我喜欢在 Linux 上编码的 5 个原因

像许多人一样，Seth Kenlon 喜欢在 Linux 上编码。在这篇文章中，他分享了这样做的 五个原因。他喜欢在 Linux 上编码，因为它建立在逻辑的基础上，可以让你欣赏代码之间的关联，提供了源代码，并提供直接访问外设和抽象层的能力，使编写代码更容易。

                    <span>开源硬件现在是一个独立领域，并且正在快速的成长中。




在软件行业中，各种类型的程序员写代码的职业已经变得很普遍，这些代码通过开源许可证发布到公共场所。业界的猎头们通常要求查看这些代码来审查未来员工候选人。那些将自己职业生涯专注在开源项目开发的人得到了回报。从 payscale.com 网站得知，Linux 系统管理员的收入比 Windows 管理员要高，这表明从事开源软件领域可以获得更高的报酬和更稳定的工作机会。分享你的工作会让你感觉良好（这甚至可能是一种因果报应），你知道自己正在为整个世界创造价值。历史上，这样的机会可从来没有为我们这些从事于开源硬件领域的人存在过。

二十多年前，几乎没有人知道开源硬件是什么，更别说围绕它规划自己的职业生涯了。举例而言，在 2000 年全世界发表了超过 200 万篇学术论文，却只有 7 篇文章提到过“开源硬件”。在我第一次写《开源实验室》 的时候，我收集了每一个案例（其实也就几十个），并且可以轻松的跟上和阅读每一篇发布的关于开源硬件的文章，还把它们发布到维基上。我很高兴的报告大家，这种情况现在已经实际上不可能了。今年已经有超过 1500 篇文章在讨论“开源硬件”，而且我相信年底的时候还会有更多的文章发表出来。开源硬件现在已经是一个独立的领域，有一些专门报导它的杂志（比如说 《HardwareX》 和 《Journal of Open Hardware》）。在更多的领域中，数十种传统杂志现在也会定期报道最新的开源硬件的发展。



开发智能开源硬件 3-D 打印 (Joshua Pearce, GNU-FDL)

即使是在十年前，从职业生涯的角度看，强调开源硬件开发在某种程度上也是一种冒险。我记得在我上一份工作的简历中，我淡化了和它相关的内容，更多的强调了我的传统工作。工业界和学术界的管理人员难以明白如果这些设计被送出去…</span>

                    <span>I spent a few days playing around with bootloaders for the first
time. This post builds up to a text editor with a few keyboard
shortcuts. I&#x27;ll be giving a virtual talk based on this work at Hacker
Nights on Jan 27.
There are a definitely bugs. But it&#x27;s hard to find intermediate
resources for bootloader programming so maybe parts of this will be
useful.
If you already know the basics and the intermediates and just want a
fantastic intermediate+ tutorial, maybe try
this. It
is very good.
The code on this post is available on
Github, but it&#x27;s more of a
mess than my usual project.
Motivation: Snake
You remember snake bootloader in a
tweet from a few
years ago?
Install qemu (on macOS or Linux), nasm, and copy the snake.asm
source code to disk from that blog post.

                    <span>When I started using Linux in the 1990s, I was in my mid-40s and accessibility was not something I gave much thought to. Now, however, as I&#x27;m pushing 70, my needs have changed. A few years ago, I purchased a brand new Darter Pro from System76, and its default resolution is 1920x1080, and it&#x27;s high DPI, too. The system came with Pop_OS!, which I found that I had to modify to be able to see the icons and text on the display. Thank goodness that Linux on the desktop has become much more accessible than in the 1990s.

大家不要误会，效果图不是上面的图。。。上面的图太复杂了，我画的老虎可没有这么好看😂。。





哈哈哈，是不太好看哈。。不要在意那些细节，这不重要！重要的是迎接 2022 年虎年的那颗炙热且纯真的心，还加了点动画，当点击老虎的头的时候会动。。。

在这里先祝大家在虎年虎虎生威，每天都能虎虎大睡！
思路
本来想画一个好看的老虎，但真的动手的时候就有点不知所措了，本来想的一层一层放图片，就有点 PS 那意思了，那样效果确实比这个好，但是诚意和这个一笔一笔画的就不一样了。
后来决定通过 Path 来进行绘制，因为 Compose 中的 Path 在之前的项目中使用的较少，那就来吧，跟着我一步一步来画这个丑老虎吧。
开始撸码
画脑袋
先来画老虎脑袋吧，说好听点叫老虎脑袋，说不好听点那就是个圆。。。
val size &#x3D; this.size
val path &#x3D; Path()
path.moveTo(size.width / 2, bigSize)
val start &#x3D; size.width / 6
​
// 画圆
path.addOval(Rect(start, 300f, start * 5, 300 + start * 5 - start))
path.close()
​
drawPath(path &#x3D; path, color &#x3D; Color.Yellow,
         style &#x3D; Stroke(width &#x3D; 10f))

Path 直接通过 addOval 就可以画一个圆，然后计算出圆的位置就行，下面来看下效果吧：

画头上的王字
脑袋画完了，接下来画一下老虎头上的王字，这是老虎的标志啊！
// 写头上的王字
path.addRect(Rect(start * 3 - 40f, 300f + 60f, …</span>

话不多说直接上图

从图中可知，分为上下两部分，上部分是传统春联和福字，代表对大家的新年祝福，下部分是主要功能模块，包含红包金额、新年幸运签和是与不是。
采用Kotlin语言进行编写，涉及到的技术有：ConstraintLayout、Drawable、
自定义View、Android动画、Viewpager2、字体的设置和传感器的使用。
创意来源
这个创意的来源，主要是年纪大了，过年肯定要给侄子侄女发红包，哈哈哈，这回金额可以他们自己摇出来，具有互动和随机性比较好玩，为新年增添一份乐趣！
新年幸运签是给大家的祝福！
大家肯定会有很多场景，会产生选择困难，所以是与不是这个模块就是解决此类问题添加的！
新年也要动起来呀，刚好传统的摇签可以用手机摇一摇来模拟效果，活动手腕一举两得（真是个好点子啊）！
安卓手机的小伙伴可以下载安装包 体验一把，我是停不下来！
正文开始啦
首先这个布局看起来挺简单的对吧，LinearLayout设置方向vertical，中间在用一个LinearLayout设置方向horizontal。

但是这就产生了一个问题，布局嵌套，所以这也是我为什么采用ConstraintLayout来实现的原因，如下图，只用了一层。

ConstraintLayout使用
啰嗦两句，有的小伙伴可以没用过，可以参考下

在ConstraintLayout中的控件横竖两个方向都至少要选择一个进行约束，否则控件将在左上角进行摆放。
top指顶部bottom指底部start指左边end指右边，上例子



这是横批的文字，可以看到，它的顶部和父布局的顶部相约束，左边和父布局的左边相约束，右边和父布局的右边相约束。

横向居中需要左右都加约束，不需要的话，想让控…</span>

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战
有一天，
我正听着歌，开心的敲着代码，这时候小王同志急冲冲的跑过来拍了拍我的肩膀，
“付老板，我这遇到一个问题，连续两次请求同一个接口，参数传的不同，但是livedata的onChange回调只走了一次，UI界面上只有一个地方更新成功了，这是咋回事啊？”
一听有bug，这我可就来劲了，立马摘下耳机，
“来，上代码”，
“诶~ 你这是在UI层注册了一个监听，然后在请求接口的地方，利用livedata连续postValue两次。看情况你这应该是postValue搞的鬼，不急，我来模拟下场景，看看他的内部实现”。
新建一个ViewModel，创建一个String类型值的MutableLiveData，向外抛出一个更新String值的方法，并且使用liveData的postValue来通知UI更新数据。
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {

    val countLiveData &#x3D; MutableLiveData()
    var title: String &#x3D; &quot;&quot;

    /**
     * livedata postValue
     */
    fun updateTitlePost(str:String) {
        title &#x3D; str
        countLiveData.postValue(title)
    } 
}

activity上直接注册一个Observer，并且在button的click中连续两次调用viewModel中更新String值的方法。

升级
各位大佬，提早祝大家新年快乐。
年初了，我们打算升级下apg，这样之后就拥抱下jetpack compose了！！
想用comopse有两个必选项agp7.0和kotlin版本1.5.31.
Java11配置
因为apg7.0需要把所有的module编译环境切换到java11版本上，然而这个地方很容易出错。
首先是命令行的配置，对于mac用户来说，可能会写死默认的java环境到1.8. 这个时候我们需要做的就是删除bashprofile内的java配置。
同时最好用命令行java --version尝试下输出的版本是不是java11。

as的配置则相对来说比较简单了。


按照这两个配置完成之后重新同步下工程应该就行了。
AndroidComponentsExtension
之前在现在准备好告别Transform了吗？的文章就简单展开了下AndroidComponentsExtension，新版本更换了extensions。这次给项目升级适配之前写的哪些插件，想了想用新不用久吗，尝试下新东西了。
onVariants
以前在写android插件的时候很多时候都需要在gralde的afterEvaluate方法执行之后才能获取到很多安卓对应的属性。
这次在v2的api中，则提供了非常多不同的节点，让我们在不同的阶段做一些不同的事情。
比如说onVariants,beforeVariants,finalizeDsl这三个不同的阶段，正常情况下我们选择onVariants就足够了。
Component Artifacts
demo 地址
Gralde 内的一部分核心是Task，但是要想写好一个Task其实并没有想象中的那么容易。特别是一个CacheableTask,他更多的关注与他们的输入和输出。
构建缓存(build cache)的工作…</span>

Hi，很高兴见到你！👋🏻
本文主要分享 Android 无障碍功能 的一些优化经验，希望看完本篇，可以帮助到你，以及哪些特殊的用户群体。
前言
最近我们团队收到了一些用户的反馈：

有用户反馈，我们的部分功能按钮在无障碍下无法正常识别。其实这已经不是我第一次看到反馈了，第一次是16年ios端收到了用户的反馈，进行过一次优化。说来惭愧，反而是我们 Android 这边也一直没有专门适配。
什么是无障碍功能？
对于一些视障人群或者听障人群而言，普通的App对它们来说使用起来可能困难重重。在 Android 上，对于这些用户用户而言，主要通过系统附带的屏幕阅读器 TalkBack 来进行控制设备。
所以无障碍功能是应用开发中的重要组成部分，通过集成无障碍功能和服务，可以提高应用的易用性尤其是对于残障用户而言。
背景与现状
我国现在 1691万 视障人士，2780万 听障人士，2977万 肢体残障人士，数据来源于 2021年第7次 人口普查，中国互联网络信息中心官网。
在国内，专门去处理的并不太多，一是因为这件事情很多开发者并不知晓(我们下面会提到为什么)，再者相对而言的收益可能并不高及一般也没有用户反馈，这件事情就一直没有太被重视，对于 无障碍功能 ，可能更多是部分工具App中常见，比如某些抢红包等插件。
而 无障碍功能 的适配在国外却是相对比较常见的一个事，甚至于某些国家如果不做适配可能会无法上架；
纵观业内，腾讯系产品在这方面做的比较好，当然这与他们内部标准的开发规则及庞大的 用户群体 也有关系。
那为什么大多数开发者不知晓呢？
其实主要源于 Android原生UI 对于 无障碍 并不是 强制性 的，所以大多数国内开发者在初入 Android 时甚至都没法…</span>

                    <span>上海又撞上疫情，连续三年春节不能回家，对父母始终有些亏欠。
昨天(春节前10天)，收到微信的提示，提示使用定制红包封面。
突然发觉这是个好主意。不能回家，那帮父母做个红包封面。自己似乎也随着红包，跟父母一起给亲戚拜年。

红包封面的设计并不复杂，小白也能轻松设计。不过前提是，要有个100粉丝的视频号或公众号。
接下来介绍下，微信红包定制的整体流程。
红包封面额度
微信发了2000个红包封面，足够我帮家里每个人定制红包的。
值得注意的是，封面会在2022年2月1日23:59过期，只能在大年初二前使用。
微信红包团队的生意算盘太响了。这活动，不但给红包封面带来大量新用户，后期也能让不少人续费红包时间。

没用获取红包封面额度也没关系，可以自行购买。封面费用是1元/个，有效期半年。
封面平台注册
领取定制红包额度后，提示登录到微信红包封面开放平台。
首次使用封面平台，需要注册并认证。如果你是用个人身份认证，注册中无付费环节。

个人认证，需要100粉丝的视频号或公众号。

注意，绑定的个人微信号需要实名认证。
红包封面设计
注册成功后，即可定制红包封面。
微信提供了 psd 和 sketch 的红包封面模板，流程参考微信红包封面官方文档。
不懂设计模板能不能用？
可以的。
零基础用小画家，有图层概念则用 Figma。
不管工具如何，你上传图片，即可完成红包设计。
示例基础图片 (推荐手写字体：杨任东竹石体)
封面注意事项

红包封面会展示公众号名称和头像。名称一年可修改两次，头像一个月可申请修改5次。因为红包是给家人用的，不方便展示公众号信息。我选了个不用的公众号，把名称和头像都修改了。
红包审核需要3个工作日，距离春节也已经很近了。如果你想在春节使用定制红包，尽快申请审核三个红包封面，避免最后关头未通过。
如果微信红包封面中出现肖像，需要授权。拜年红包还是希望有全家福，我提交了资料，但通过几率不大。

完成后的红包：

                    <span>我们活在别人设计好的标签里，如果撕掉标签，我们无法认识世界，也无法认识自己。那个挂满标签的自己活在朋友圈、某书、某博里，唯独没有活在当下。
互联网就像汽车，可以带我们到不借助工具到不了的地方。但与汽车不同的是，我们只在需要出门的时候用汽车，却时时刻刻都在上网。
我个人认为互联网斋戒完全不需要理由，因为它对我茶毒太深。我时刻想逃离但逃不掉，如果能戒掉互联网我确定自己会活的更快乐。每次周末看到手机推送的屏幕使用时间，都会心里一惊。但始终无法下定决心戒手机，一是怕别人找我有急事，二是不上网我不知道还能干啥。

花几天时间，用最俭省的费用生活，穿最朴素的衣服，然后问自己：“这是我所害怕的生活吗？” ——塞内加

我不害怕朴素的生活，但“无聊”的生活却让我害怕，“网络似乎剥夺了我专注和沉思的能力。”记者尼古拉斯·卡尔2008年在《大西洋月刊》上发表的一篇文章中坦言，“而且不只有我是这样” 。网络不仅让我们 “无法思考”，而且让我们无法忍受“无聊”。
每时每刻都被互联网刺激着，偶尔停下来我会发现自己其实非常疲惫。
上网太快乐了，有游戏的快乐、学习的快乐、还有与人交流的快乐，只要有网络我就不愁没事干。但这种把我填满的快乐，会让我在某些时候觉得可怕，有种看完《黑镜》之后的窒息感。如果一切都通过电子屏来感受，那什么是真实的呢？
为了找到“真实”，我进行了如下的“实验”：
一、个人实验
1. 中秋三天断网实验
中秋节三天假期是我的互联网安息日，这三天大家只能通过电话和短信与我联系。

为了平安的度过这三天，我提前做了一些保障措施：

买够三天要吃的食材，因为没网点不了外卖。
给自己安排好各种活动，第一天去烫了个头发、第二天去电影院看了个电影（断网前买好了电影票），第三天啥都没干。
准备好本子、实体书、钩织图解，填满自己的时间。（互联网的荼毒，为什么我不能让自己什么都不干？）

引言
作为一个普通人，在使用 iPhone 的将近 14 年时间里，Due 陪伴我走过了 6 年多的时间。并且在这 6 年多的时间里，看着很多人从 OminiFocus 用到 Things，而它牢牢霸占了我首屏上的一个固定位置，就像已经「刻」在那里了一样。
普通人的效率，也可以没那么复杂。
一、我与 GTD 的初遇
梦回 2014 年的年初，正在公车通勤路上的我，在播客上听到了《狗熊有话说》的主播，@i大狗熊 的一期关于 GTD 理论的介绍，大概意思是，关于 OmniFocus 这款时间管理应用程序的使用心得，将任务根据紧急、重要程度，分到四个象限进行归类，方便在日后进行任务管理时快速拾取，规划并掌控自己的时间，高效工作、生活。
男人至死是少年，iPhone 对我来说就是一款随身「小霸王」，琳琅满目的 App 便是各种陈列在街头拐角游戏商店中的「卡带」，而这类兼具效率和格调的 App 则犹如卡带界的「记忆卡」，令我向往和着迷。
听了这期播客之后，我便开始规划起了自己的时间管理之路，憧憬着自己掌控时间、掌控命运、升职加薪的美好未来。于是我打开 App Store，搜索关键字 OmniFocus，新鲜感带着肾上腺素刺激着我的交感神经，哪怕现在用自己的流量下载，我也要立刻得到它！
想必接下来的事情大家都能猜到，阻碍在我面前的不是那一点点流量的问题，而是熟悉的下载按钮变成了一个三位数数字，258 元。对于刚毕业找到工作的我来说，这在当时约等于我十多天的伙食费了…</span>

                    <span>When we reviewed the OPPO Enco M31 in 2020, we called it the champion of budget Bluetooth earphones. The audio quality that the Enco M31 offered was miles ahead of competitors and together with features like LDAC support, they punched well above their weight. So naturally, when OPPO refreshed its neckband lineup with the Enco

                    <span>作为设计师，我特别喜欢一位美食编辑说过的一段话：Food is becoming an art form more than ever before and presentation is almost as important as taste: we eat with our eyes first, don’t we?食物越来越成为了一门艺术，食物的呈现方式和味道一样重要。没有发现我们是用眼睛先来“品尝“食物的吗？
西餐中有个专业词汇就叫做”Food Presentation[1]”, 直译就是“食物的汇报“（意译是食物的呈现方式），这个直译是不是特别的形象？就像是我们一个项目结束，精心准备了一个从排版到内容无比精良又吸引人的的PPT，去给客户做汇报；美好的食物原材料也在厨师的精心烹饪下最后以一个漂亮又吸引人的方式呈现给了食客。

西餐（这里指的是贵西餐）因为分餐制，还有烹饪方式更多的是煎炸炖烤，最后一步“组合食材摆盘”，给我们的印象就是非常注重「摆盘的艺术」（The design in plating）,我自己在做菜和海外生活的这么多年中，也是特别喜欢学习和积累这样的食物呈现方式，毕竟好看赏心悦目的菜品谁不喜欢呢？

年夜饭或者纪念日等非常有意义的庆祝时刻，如果想露一手，非常推荐借鉴一些西式烹饪和摆盘的技巧，知道原理和方法后简单容易上手。相比起咱们中餐中造型独特美丽的菜品，比如「松鼠桂鱼」「文思豆腐」对于刀工还有火候厨艺技能的高要求，西式摆盘还是门槛低的多的多，也更容易复刻到家常餐桌上。

                    <span>感谢@知乎美食 邀（cuī）请（cù），让我在忙到起飞的年底完成了自己很早就想做的一件事，就是复制经典传统川菜给大家吃（kàn）。从下面的留言情况来看，点川菜的不多呀，但是有一个聪明可爱的朋友提到了一个东西，很多四川本地人可能也没吃过，那就是蛋圆子。我决定就Pick它了！

在介绍蛋圆子之前，我先要介绍两款有点雷同的食物。一个是武汉黄陂三鲜里的肉糕，那是用鱼肉和猪肉按1:5的比例绞成泥做的，口感弹牙，鱼肉增加了明显的鲜甜。

二是在四川川北地区，尤其是绵阳梓潼县为盛的镶碗，那是用精肉和豆腐剁成茸，加鸡蛋、芡粉后上蒸笼，再依次添加一层蛋黄、一层蛋白。出来是这样的：

而蛋圆子呢，是四川川南地区宜宾一带的代表性食物，在宴席上担任“头碗”，其重要性不言而喻。名叫圆子，其实并不是圆的，而是圆柱体。肉不是打成泥或茸，而且切成筷子或小指头粗细，和鸡蛋、红薯粉、盐、白胡椒、姜末、鸡精等和匀，装裹进蛋皮里，上蒸笼蒸熟。 

以上三道菜，看起来有点像，我相信以中国之大，其他地区还有类似的，欢迎知友们补充。不管是肉糕、镶碗、蛋圆子，不管肉和鸡蛋是什么形式的组合，都是先蒸熟，再搭配其他食材复蒸。黄陂三鲜是鱼圆、肉圆、肉糕，吃的时候蒸十分钟，在用高汤煨着，配木耳、平菇、白菜等，也可以煮火锅、配面条。镶碗则重在吃汤，切好片的肉辅以猪心舌脏片和肥肠、酥肉、响皮、炸豆腐皮、木耳、黄花、粉条、白菜，浇上高汤，蒸锅一开形如宝盖莲花、色泽亮丽，口味清淡馥郁。蛋圆子切片以后，下面垫上蒸熟的荔浦芋头（当地人叫黑秆秆芋）、黄花、木耳、拆骨肉，上面在盖上蛋圆子片，和一块猪油、少许葱末，复蒸10分钟即可。
镶碗和蛋圆子可能都会颠覆外地人对川菜的认知，因为它们跟辣椒一点也不沾边。作为宴席菜，它们都需要制作者在前期准备大量工作，临上桌前复蒸很快，这样可以大大缩短上菜时间，提高出菜效率。
既然是老菜新做，我想从两个方面对宜宾…</span>

NO NO NO! 
是时候放烤箱、电饭煲和空气炸锅这现代厨房三大宝出来一战了！

受 @知乎美食 邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，豆蔻我一眼瞅到知友@DDDDDDD 说想学做烤鸡，嘿哟你可问对人了！
本吃鸡狂魔今天给大家带来了【黄油鸡腿卷】、【彩虹时蔬烤鸡胸】、【盐焗鸡】这3道！聚餐贼有面子的美貌菜！最多不超过3步，就能完成，绝对厨房小白友好~

第一道：奶油鸡腿卷
香香嫩嫩的烤鸡腿好吃是好吃，但是当个正儿八经的菜上桌总是有点过于豪横，所以这次咱换个方式，烤个鸡腿卷！
有菜有肉，吃的时候还不用沾一手油~


食材： 手枪腿 香菇 胡萝卜
调料：盐、黑胡椒、芝士粉、黄油
1、手枪腿去骨，在肉上打上花刀，撒上一层盐和奶酪粉，放上切片的香菇、胡萝卜、小块的黄油

2、然后把鸡腿对折用牙签稍微固定一下

3、再拿根绳子捆紧，表面撒上一层薄薄的盐（盐它可以帮助鸡皮快速脱水，烤出来更加金黄酥脆），送进预热好的空气炸锅，160度烤40分钟（或烤箱180度50分钟）就好了！

成品是这样的！点开大图瞅瞅，看到上面鼓起的小泡泡了咩？这是鸡皮酥脆的好像薯片一样的证据，拿筷子敲敲还咔咔直响！
你要是想吃那可得手脚麻利些，出炉就立刻马上解开绳子，把它扒下来，超过10分钟鸡皮就会回软啦～

但回软不代表味道会变差，切成厚片装盘，蘸着盘底的鸡汁，味道会更好！
看，香菇和胡萝卜被嫩嫩的鸡肉紧紧地裹着，给浓郁的肉香里加入了蔬菜的清甜。鸡肉卷里面汁水特别充盈，只是轻轻捏着就淌的我满手的汤！

黄油和奶酪粉的香气渗入在鸡肉和蔬菜里，我切的时候那个浓郁抹奶香味从里到外的扩散开来，你们不知道我费多大劲才忍住不吃（≧∇≦）

什么？对奶味接受无能？别走别走！还可以试试下面这一道彩虹时蔬烤鸡胸呀～
这道菜是餐桌上大家接受度最高的清新派，蔬菜多，微酸甜！我敢打赌，就算是过年也在减肥的都市丽人…</span>

                    <span>依靠 1988 年的大型机的流程造成了 10 亿英镑的养老金黑洞

英国国家审计署的一份报告发现，ICL 时代遗留下来的大型机是 10 亿英镑的 国家养老金黑洞 的原因之一。英国劳工部所赖以管理数以百万计的养老金领取者记录的基础 IT 系统可以追溯到 1988 年，而且需要大量的手工操作。该部门现有的质量检查未能发现成千上万的养老金领取者的系统性欠费，这些老人因而领不到应得的养老金。这是由于依赖于“自动化程度有限”的系统的流程，并且需要“使用多个系统和解释复杂的规则”。工作人员对升级系统有抵触情绪，因为“从商业角度来看，这样做的过程是非常复杂和非常有风险的。”此外，工作人员还需要访问不同的 IT 系统，并手动将信息从一个系统复制到另一个系统，以计算养老金奖励。


老王点评：如何使 IT 系统也能不断更新换代，这是一个系统性的工程。




SUSE 瞄准后 CentOS 市场，发布 Liberty Linux

SUSE 突然在其网站上宣布了 Liberty Linux，加入了后 CentOS 市场争夺。该产品似乎是 SUSE 对 CentOS 8 的重建，旨在实现接近完美的 RHEL 8 兼容性。目前该发行版还没有可以公开下载的版本，不过除了内核，它的所有 RPM 都构建自红帽官方的源代码 RPM 包。它的内核来自 SUSE 自己的 SLE 企业发行版。有意思的是，SUSE 并没有将 Liberty Linux 描述为一个发行版，而是将其描述为“技术和支持产品”、“一个技术和支持解决方案”，以及“现有 Linux 的技术和支持模式，而不是另一个新的 Linux 发行版”。


老王点评：SUSE 眼馋 CentOS 市场这并不奇怪，但是却将其作为一个服务产品，颇显得扭扭捏捏。




恶意行为者利用供应链攻击在近百款 WordPress 主题和插件中植入后门

AccessPress 是一家 WordPress 插件开发商，其开放的插件和主题在超过 36 万个活跃网站中使用。恶意行为者通过供应链攻击破坏了它的 40 个主题和 53 个插件。这些后门 已经在相当多运行 WordPress 的网站上被发现。但在 WordPress 项目的官方网站上镜像的相同主题和插件仍然是干净的，而直接从 AccessPress 获得的软件的用户在不知情的情况下为攻击者提供了后门权限。这些主题和插件可能已经被植入后门已久。


老王点评：对于这样的供应链攻击，用户有什么办法吗？相信绝大多数的用户没有能力审查代码。</span>

                    <span>为这个自由操作系统的新用户和老用户提供 15 种资源。




在整个上世纪 80 年代和 90 年代，DOS 是桌面之王。世界各地的程序员不满足于 DOS 的专有版本，他们共同创建了一个名为 FreeDOS 的开源版本，该版本于 1994 年首次推出。FreeDOS 项目 在 2021 年及以后还在继续发展。

我们发表了几篇关于 FreeDOS 的文章，以帮助新用户开始使用 FreeDOS 和学习新程序。以下是去年我们最受欢迎的几篇 FreeDOS 文章。

初学 FreeDOS

你是 FreeDOS 的新手吗？如果你想了解如何启动和运行 FreeDOS 的基本知识，请查看这些文章：


开始使用 FreeDOS：它看起来像复古计算时代，但 FreeDOS 是一个现代的操作系统，你可以用它来完成事情。

在 FreeDOS 中像 Emacs 一样编辑文本：如果你已经熟悉了 GNU Emacs，你应该在 Freemacs 中感到很自在。

在 Linux 和 FreeDOS 之间复制文件：学习如何在 FreeDOS 虚拟机和 Linux 桌面系统之间传输文件。

如何在 FreeDOS 上归档文件：这是 FreeDOS 版本的 tar，在 DOS 上归档的标准方法是 Zip 和 Unzip。

在 FreeDOS 上使用这个怀旧的文本编辑器：让人联想到 Linux ed(1)，当你想用老式的方法编辑文本时，Edlin 是一种乐趣。


使用 FreeDOS

当你启动进入 FreeDOS，你可以使用这些很棒的工具和应用来完成工作或安装其他软件：


如何使用 FreeDOS 的文本编辑器：FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器，叫做 FreeDOS Edit。

在 FreeDOS 上听音乐：Mplayer 是一个开源的媒体播放器，通常可以在 Linux、Windows、Mac 和 DOS 上找到。

在 FreeDOS 上安装和删除软件包：了解如何使用 FDIMPLES，即 FreeDOS 包管理器，在你的 FreeDOS 系统上安装和删除软件包。

为什么我喜欢用 GW-BASIC 在 FreeDOS 上编程：BASIC 是我进入计算机编程的起点。我已经很多年没有写过 BASIC 代码了，但我对 BASIC 和 GW-BASIC 永远怀有好感。

用 Bywater BASIC 在 FreeDOS 上编程：在你的 FreeDOS 系统上安装 Bywater BASIC，并开始尝试使用 BASIC 编程。


在其近 30 年的历程中，FreeDOS 一直试图成为一个现代 DOS。如果你想了解更多，你可以在 FreeDOS 简史 中阅读关于 FreeDOS 的起源和发展。另外，请看 Don Watkins 关于 FreeDOS 的采访：一个大学生是如何创立一个自由和开源的操作系统。

如果你想尝试 FreeDOS，请下载 2021 年 12 月发布的 FreeDOS 1.3 RC5。这个版本有大量的新变化和改进，包括更新的内核和命令 shell，新的程序和游戏，更好的国际支持，以及网络支持。从 FreeDOS 网站下载 FreeDOS 1.3 RC5。

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-14203-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">

                    <span>System76 分享了其即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板草图。看起来令人惊叹！




System76 令人兴奋的用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的开发工作现在正在进行中。

虽然我们已经用早期的代码 试过了，但我们现在可以看到更多的东西。从其 GitHub 仓库 和 Figma 文档 的一些原型中，我们可以看到它的更多信息。

值得注意的是，我们可以看到顶部面板和系统托盘，正如你在 COSMIC 桌面上所期望的那样。

这仍是一项正在进行的工作，可能会有变化。

COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板

Pop!_OS 依赖于 GNOME 扩展来通过顶部面板或系统托盘图标提供更多的功能。

随着即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面，看起来他们正在创建新的小程序，与当前的外观相融合，并提供更多的功能。

开发者 Eduardo Flores 分解研究 了它，发现了关键的区别以及 System76 的目标是如何使其发挥作用。

而且，这也是它更有趣的地方：


看起来 System76 正在摆脱传统的“扩展”，计划为第三方小程序设计一个 API，这与 KDE、XFce 和其他公司的做法类似。

这是一个令人兴奋的消息，将使 COSMIC 成为一个更强大的桌面环境，使其可以扩展和定制。


另外，似乎这些小程序也可以和顶部面板一起放在坞站里。我们会在其未来的某个测试版中看到更多的实际情况。

在这里，让我重点介绍一下从现有的草图中观察到的基本变化：

1、声音小程序



与我们现在所拥有的相比，COSMIC 的目标是增加细化的控制，如选择输入/输出设备、在顶部面板上切换媒体控制的选项、控制媒体播放，以及访问声音设置。

虽然草图没有显示专辑封面，但在发布前会包括它。

作为参考，以下是 Pop!_OS 顶部面板选项现在的样子。



2、电源小程序



很高兴看到有一个专门的电源按钮来快速访问系统设置、锁屏和注销。

另外，暂停、重启和关机的按钮应该可以提高可用性，关闭计算机不用额外的点击。

3、网络小程序

虽然你可以很容易地打开或关闭有线、无线网络，但会弹出一个占据了整个屏幕的单独窗口来选择 Wi-Fi 网络并输入密码。



但是，看起来我们终于可以在这里输入密码，连接到可用的无线网络，并重试失败的连接，而不必从活动窗口分心。所有这些都发生在系统托盘上的网络小程序上，如上面的截图所示。

同样，你可以看到关于你的有线连接的更多信息，包括 IP 地址和速度。

4、日期、时间和日历小程序



最重要的日历小程序看起来更加实用，信息量更大。通知区不再驻留在这里（它现在有一个单独的小程序），使它的体验更干净，可以把注意力放在你关注的东西上。

一些细微的视觉改进，比如用重点颜色来突出日历中的某一行，应该会使它更容易理解。

5、通知中心



正如我前面提到的，通知现在有一个独立的空间。通知小程序会将所有的通知堆积起来，并允许你在需要时展开它们，或者将它们全部清除。

我们仍然有“请勿打扰”开关，并可以快速访问通知设置。

6、图形模式小程序



这对笔记本电脑用户来说应该是非常有用的，可以在图形模式之间无缝切换，并可以看到当前使用的哪种模式。

除了所有这些，还有一个蓝牙小程序、一个电池电源模式小程序，以及一些其他的东西，比如改变输入语言或输入源的能力。





鉴于这是初次看到使用 Rust 开发 COSMIC 桌面顶部面板的外观，看来我们有很多东西要去看了。

总结

总的来说，System76 正准备为我们提供一个高度可定制但又简化的 COSMIC 桌面版本。

而所有这些都应该有助于形成一种独特的桌面体验。当然，明年你就得在 Pop!_OS 中和 GNOME 说再见了。

你怎么看？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法！

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第6天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
前言
在阅读Kotlin的代码时，经常有看到 :: 这个符号，这个符号专业术语叫做成员引用，在代码中使用可以简化代码，那到底怎么使用呢以及使用的范围，这篇文章就来好好捋一下。
正文
这里虽然很熟悉，但是我们还是从简单说起，需要了解为什么这样设计。
传递函数优化
这里我们举个栗子，就看这个熟悉的sortBy排序函数，先定义People类：
//测试代码
data class People(val name: String,val age: Int){
    //自定义的排序条件
    fun getMax() : Int{
        return age * 10 + name.length
    }
}

然后我们来进行排序：
val people &#x3D; People(&quot;zyh&quot;,10)
val people1 &#x3D; People(&quot;zyh1&quot;,100)
val peopleList &#x3D; arrayListOf(people,people1)
//给sortBy传入lambda
peopleList.sortBy { people -&gt; people.getMax() }

这里我们给sortBy函数传递一个lambda，由于sortBy函数是内联的，所以传递给它的lambda会被内联，但是假如现在有个问题，就是这些lambda已经被定义成了函数变量，比如我定义了一个顶层函数：
//定义了一个顶层函数
fun getMaxSort(people: People): Int{
    return (people.age) * 10 + people.name.length
}

或者排序条件已经定义成了一个变量值：
//排序条件
val cond…</span>

「2022 年什么会火？什么该学？本文正在参与“聊聊 2022 技术趋势”征文活动 」
技术进阶之GC优化
接上一篇文章中讨论过的新技术要具备哪些特点，而良好的性能是新技术“好不好”的一个测量维度，本文主要讨论内存方面的性能，一提到内存大家可能会想到GC，多多少少也会说出一些GC的基础知识，但是很多人对这方面有过的的优化措施却并不是很了解，于是本文讨论一些GC的历史优化，这也是这周在研究的一个技术进阶，好了，该发车了~。
关于GC大多数程序员都只是知道怎么判定垃圾，哪几种回收方式，回收过程这些知识，当然面试官也主要考察的这部分知识。但是我们知其然也要知其所以然，所以笔者从历代GC技术的优化方案来进行讲解，涉及到回收过程中一些细节和改动优化点，从这些优化点当中学到的不只是针对GC的，同样的优化方案在项目中或者在理解更深层次的知识的时候也会起到帮助作用
1.GC Roots遍历提升效率
以往做法
当垃圾回收器线程进行GC时，
第一步需要找到GC Roots；
第二步通过GC Roots进行遍历堆中引用GC Roots的对象形成引用链；
第三步，将不在引用链中的对象标记进行标记（需要回收的对象），或者标记引用链中的对象（需要复制，整理的对象），具体标记哪种对象根据堆中的分代内存不同和采用的垃圾回收算法来确定。
可优化地方以及优化原理
上述过程第二步中遍历堆中引用GC Roots的对象，这部分随着堆内存的越来越大需要的时间也会逐步增长。如果能够提前知道堆中哪部分内存是引用，来判断是否引用GC Roots这样效率是不是会更高一些。
没错，JVM从Exact VM开始就已经采用了准确式内存管理即知道哪部分内存是引用；而且在即时编译的过程中我也会知道栈中或者寄存器里哪部分内存是引用。这个时候我用一个数据结构来存储这些信息，在第二步中就不需要遍历整…</span>

「卡片笔记写作法」用久了，你总会遇到一个问题，就是卡片太多。
这一方面是个效率问题。你要是想把卡片笔记当成严肃的工具，那么底层就得用数据库来组织信息，而非文件系统。Logseq 目前正在做这种迁移。在卡片少的时候，这二者的效率看不出差别，甚至文件组织方式因为直观显得更加友好。但是卡片到了 10 万级别的时候，效率的差别就会显现。效率不达标，随便查找个东西，你都能感受到「卡」。
以我个人的 Roam Research 数据统计为例。虽然「页面」（Page）只有 1 万多，但是别忘了 Roam Research 下的真正卡片单位，是按「块」（block）来计算。

Roam Research 里 Page 的真正含义是什么呢？我觉得是「盒子」，卡片盒嘛。虽不是物理意义上的盒子，有固定形态，但它确实是承载卡片的容器。在 Roam Research 中，如果你的链接都在页面层级，而不是块引用（block reference），那么你其实并没有发挥出它「细粒度」的特性。
效率问题，还只是一个方面。更要命的，是卡片数量庞大之后，你会忘记自己曾经记过某些东西。本文主要讨论的，便是这个恼人的事儿。
最近，「合桃派」团队邀请医学博士 Lan 分享自己的块引用实践。她结合 Cite to write 和 Roam Untangled 两门课程里的方法，利用块引用自底向上构造「问题」，然后用「问题」的块引用来组织论文。她的第一篇综述论文靠着双链笔记工具的加持，超出预期快速写就，且已被录用。 Lan 这种学以致用的精神，很值得钦佩。
讨论环节，我问了她一个问题 —— 若是很久前（一两年前）记录的卡片，内容忘记了怎么办？新的笔记若与之相关，怎么回忆、识别并且链接呢？
Lan 回答，她依靠头脑人工记忆完成链接。
这个回答，很实…</span>

                    <span>突发奇想的想在少数派写这些东西，我也不知道是否会有人喜欢喜爱咖啡，但我一个咖啡从业者希望大家可以慢慢接受咖啡，并且把咖啡和茶放在同一个地位。说的比较大，主要还是想把好喝的咖啡带给大家认识。

今天这篇软文主要是想给大家了解下普通家庭如何入门咖啡～～
首先，你是否喝茶？额，可能有些人会疑惑，喝咖啡为何还会问是否喝茶。但其实茶和咖啡一样，都带有苦涩的成分，如果你能接受喝茶，那喝咖啡就不会有太大问题，两者都属于苦涩甘甜类型。
方便大家理解，这边制图告诉大家。


烘焙程度酸度-MAX5⭐醇度-MAX5⭐
浅度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
中度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
深度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


就和上图标识的一样，烘焙程度取决了咖啡的酸和苦。通过表格其实就很好理解，如果你想喝咖啡，先选好你喜欢什么样的风格。酸？苦？甜？涩？新手入门的话不管是在售卖咖啡的地方还是在连锁咖啡店，都推荐从中度烘焙开始尝试，因为这个阶段有很多种不一样的风味，当你在这个烘焙程度喝习惯后，你可以尝试下浅度烘焙，这会让你感觉不像在喝咖啡，而是想在品一杯果汁。这深度烘焙的话，我建议上意式浓缩就是最好的选择，上面两种烘焙程度建议进行手冲来品尝。
说到冲煮方式，这里前两种烘焙都建议手冲进行，给大家介绍下咖啡的冲煮方式吧～～～
1、滴滤手冲
V60手冲
这是一个V60滤杯的手冲器具，嗯。。。可能大家都想问V60是什么，其实这个名字是按照滤杯的角度命名的，60度刚好是它的角度，V代表了这个形状。这款手冲器具相对来说比较适合新手，简单又可以自我调整也便宜。
————————————可以淘宝这款器具，推荐塑料款————————————
2、法压壶
法压壶
这是一个壶，法式压力壶。法压壶其实也很适合新手，之所以介绍它，是因为它的冲煮方式不一样，它是压力式的，当它浸泡时间一到就可以下压压杆完成冲煮，冲煮方式极其简单方便。

                    <span>10分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
“和危险的动物接触”之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需。
抵达注射点后，可以向分诊台的工作人员咨询具体的注射流程；如果你是晚上去的，也可以找急诊的工作人员咨询。
在接触动物后的 24 小时内是最重要的免疫时间，因此如果第一家注射点受阻，还来得及去第二家注射点，不要着急。
医生会询问你的情况，然后判断是否需要注射狂犬疫苗，如果需要的话，会给你开一张清单，你需要按照这个清单上的时间按时…</span>

手机虚拟机是什么？
手机虚拟机，用过电脑虚拟机的听到应该也不会陌生，其实就是内置在手机本体内的又一个系统。它虽然是模拟真机环境，但与本机系统最大的区别在于：你拥有对该系统的自主掌控权，也就是常说的「自带 root」或者「免 root」，多用于软件测试（包括安装非官方渠道应用）和应用多开。

提到这里，不免要区分下云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机。
云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机的区别
云手机：运行在 ARM 架构（适用于移动通讯领域）的服务器上，性能由服务器决定，用户需要通过远程访问云手机操控，不影响本机系统，但也存在网络延迟现象。
Android 模拟器：其实与手机虚拟机类似。Android 模拟器运行在电脑端，需要通过键盘鼠标来操控。对于习惯手游的用户来说，除特殊需求，使用频率并不算高。
手机虚拟机：运行在手机内，占用手机内存和运算能力，因而手机性能的高地直接决定了虚拟机的运行流畅度，优势是共享真机网络。
三者各有优势，加上成本因素（包括金钱和操作）来考量的话，倾向使用手机虚拟机的人越来越多。毕竟对于生活玩家来说，一台手机上就能免费完成应用多开、软件测试的需求，何乐而不为。
常见的手机虚拟机有哪些，优缺点是什么？
真机性能越好，虚拟机运行才会越流畅，类比在手机里运行的游戏应用。这几年各大手机厂商都在疯狂给手机加配置，又正是洞察到了我们的需求。
市场上主流的三款虚拟机也都一一使用过一段时间（仅以酷安上的数据为参照）。

VMOS Pro、光速和 51 虚拟机，三者其实大同小异，最受欢迎的多开，悬浮窗，挂机等…</span>

                    <span>终端是很多人日常打交道的工具之一。比如，深度学习是目前一个大热的研究课题，由于训练和推理过程需要强大的 GPU，研究生们共享 GPU 服务器，并通过终端使用 SSH 连接并编写代码。而公司中的运维人员，也需要通过 SSH 进行远程访问服务器，对系统或服务进行维护。
在日常操作中，最大的问题就是如何优雅地从远程主机中复制文本并粘贴到本机中。
问题：跨平台系统剪贴板不通
远程主机一般我们不能直接通过显示器和键盘控制，也没有图形界面，所有的操作都需要通过 SSH 访问并在终端操作。
而本机和远程主机都各自有自己的一套剪切板，在命令操作中复制的文本只会保存在远程主机的剪贴板中。那我们通过终端的图形界面选择并复制不可以吗？

上图是一个非常日常的场景，我们需要从一个配置文件里复制一行或是多行的代码，这里我们选择的工具是 VIM。但我们真的开始复制时就会遇到如下的困难：

困难一：如果只想要复制正文，那么左侧的代码行号也不得不被选择。尽管这个可以通过绑定快捷键快速开关行号。
困难二：细心观察，图中文本的第三行超过了终端的宽度，自动换行到下一行展示。如果同时选择这两行，粘贴出来的效果也会是两行而不是它本该的一行。
困难三：整份文档并不只有 24 行，如果想要复制整份文档，则不得不分几次逐次选择并复制全终端屏幕。

而这些情况也的确困扰了我很久。
解决方案：OSC codes
OSC 代表的是 Operating System Controls, 是一种约定俗成的用于终端程序中的逃逸序列表达，终端会根据 OSC codes 所定义的行文处理方式处理它所包围的文本。
而正巧的是就有一种定义决定了「如何从终端中复制内容到系统剪贴板中」，那就是 OSC 52 escape sequence。
OSC 52 一次最长接受 100000 个字节，其中前 7 个字节为 &quot;\033]52;c;&quot;，中间 …</span>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

前言
收到我人生最大的一笔单篇稿费的这天晚上，我失眠了。
当然不是因为钱多烧的，而是白天咖啡喝多了 2021 年最后一篇稿子赚来的稿酬成功让我回想起了成为少数派作者的这一年。
我是 Leslie，一个致力于让没有医学背景的人听懂医生在说啥的科普作者，一年以前，我还只是一个潜水的小透明，现在却混进了少数派的作者群。不过和作者群里两百多个大佬不一样，我不太厉害。在「高效工作」领域，我是个吊车尾，不会编程，不会拆电脑修手机，不会摄影，不会录播客，不会剪视频；在「品质生活」方面，我不会马伽术，不会做厉害的咖啡或是诱人的饭菜，不会种菜，不会俄语，没有惊人的读书量和阅片量，去过的地方也很少。在以上知识技能和经历方面相信很多读者都可以来无情地碾压我。而且我还是个内向的「社恐」。
但你既然已经读到了这篇文章，说明我对这个社区还是有一点点价值的。一直以来我写的多是具体的医学健康话题，这次，我想讲点柔软的，讲讲在成为了少数派作者的这一年，我这样的普通人在坚持写作之后，在网络上终于开始 reach out 之后，有了什么样的改变和思考。希望可以鼓励到和我有着类似渴望或相同困境的读者。
在关系中成长——和编辑的故事
正如《也许你该找个人聊聊》的作者所说，人和人是在关系中成长的。
我向来习惯在现实生活和社交网络中对陌生人保持缄默，而在少数派上写稿、加入作者群，让我产生了新的和人的联结，我认识了好多编辑，有的勇敢，有的善良，有的很宽容，有的很硬汉。在这样的交流中我除了交了十几篇稿…</span>

👋 Hey there!
It is great to be back from my Winter Break. It has only been six weeks but much has happened… 
We had a wonderful holiday season and I hope you all did as well. After capping off the season of merriment and singing Auld Lang Syne it was time for a big birthday for me. Jamie v5.0.0 arrived on January 3rd and my family arranged a tremendous day. I also noted a couple of thoughts.
We all took the day off and had fun presenting, hiking, and escaping! I even got my very own song, the Big 5 O! You can listen on Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. 🤘 I mean, how cool is that! 🤩

一个前端程序员说，他不想干前端了，咨询大家意见，转到后端是否可行。
我从2007年开始从事前端开发，到了现在，很多新技术已经不擅长了。每次打开 Chrome 开发者工具，看到那些我不知道的新功能，我总是选择忽略。
很多我熟悉的工具和功能，都已经或将被弃用。现在的前端开发都在 npm 环境，经常有难懂的报错，好不容易搜到答案，又要花很多时间修复本地开发环境。
即使那些最简单的任务，现在的开发方式也比以前复杂，要考虑很多边界场景。我能够完成的工作，不断得缩小。
我失去了继续在前端工作的信心，转到后端，会不会容易一些。
简单说就是，他觉得前端越来越难，自己跟不上，无法坚持下去了。他想知道，后端会不会更容易一些，转成后端开发是否可行？

可以想象，讨论这种问题，一定是众说纷纭。
原帖下面，各种意见都有。支持的一方说，前端现在确实变得非常复杂，技术工具的更新速度太快，开发和维护的难度超过了后端。
反对的一方说，后端也很难，如果你适应不了 Node.js，改行写 C++/Java/Go 也会很痛苦，千万不要草率做决定。

难易是主观感受，没有办法精确衡量，人与人之间不可比较。所以我觉得，讨…</span>

该计划用于集中修复许多影响 KDE 桌面的低级错误，这些错误用户在 15 分钟或更短时间内就能发现。其列入标准是，这些错误受 KDE 的默认设置影响，100% 可重现，一些基本的东西不工作或看起来有视觉上的缺陷，可能导致崩溃，需要重启或终端命令来解决或没有解决方法，最近回退的错误，或有超过五个重复的错误报告。在该计划中，第一批 有 56 个错误需要处理。


老王点评：这些不起眼而很重要的工作，才真正能将 KDE 打磨成主流桌面环境。




Opera 发布专门的内置加密钱包的浏览器

Opera 发布 了一个 Web3 Crypto 浏览器，内置加密货币钱包，更易于访问加密货币/NFT 交易所、去中心化应用 dApp 等。Opera 表示新浏览器旨在简化 Web3 用户体验。Web3 是基于区块链的去中心化互联网，是目前加密货币支持者最热衷的新事物。该浏览器的钱包支持包括以太坊、比特币等加密货币。不过，该浏览器在国内被禁止使用。


老王点评：虽然 Opera 逐渐从主流浏览器中落后，但是它专注于游戏、加密货币等领域的努力还是值得赞赏。




因 5G 干扰，国际航空公司正在减少飞往美国的航班

美国的移动电话公司正在推出的 5G 服务，使用频率在 3.7 至 3.98GHz 之间的无线电频谱，即所谓的 C 波段。国际航空业担心美国 5G 服务过于接近雷达高度计使用的频谱，也就是 4.2 至 4.4GHz 之间，因而正在减少飞往美国的航班。但国际航空业认为，欧洲没有面临同样的风险，在欧洲，5G 服务使用频率较慢的 3.4 至 3.8GHz 范围的频谱，和雷达高度仪使用的频谱之间有更大的缓冲区。此外，欧洲也限制了机场附近的 5G 天线的功率和角度，避免了对飞机的干扰。

                    <span>POSIX，你肯定在各种在线论坛和文章中，听到过这个缩写，或读到过关于它的信息。程序员和系统开发人员似乎最关心这个问题。它听起来很神秘，虽然有很多关于这个主题的好资料，但一些讨论区（简洁是它们的特点）并没有详细说明它是什么，这可能会让人困扰。那么，POSIX 到底是什么？



POSIX 简介

与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。

当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&amp;T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。

该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。

为什么有 POSIX？

一句话：可移植性。

60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。

IBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。

不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…</span>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第2天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。
前言
当然，大部分人(包括我)遇到这种问题的第一反应，应该是这样的：

不好意思放错图了，应该是这个：

而现在呢，正好在重构过程中遇到了一点小需求，让我不由得想起这个方案来：

我们先抛开成本、人力、可行性之类的事实不提，难道这套方案真的没有可行性？🤪
貌似还是有那么🤏一丢丢的
这里先不谈瞳孔图片怎么处理，假如真给你搞出图片了，应该怎么处理呢？
在Flutter中，对图片主题色进行分析提取，应该怎么搞：
在原生上，其实已经有很多应用实现了对图片主题色进行提取的操作，这说明方案至少是有实现可能性，可能性还不小；（比如说 android 的 Palette ）
那么按照国际惯例，又到了抄原生代码的时候了：
Palette 源码解析
Palette的原理其实并不复杂，跳到启动解析的地方，可以看到其代码量并不多，而且有比较详细注释说明：

根据注释简单总结下步骤：
1、缩放压缩图片，没必要整那么大，并根据最后缩放效果同步计算区域之类的信息；
2、调用 getPixelsFromBitmap ，解析图片的像素信息，存到数组中；
3、构造 ColorCutQuantizer ，计算主题色都是哪些：

1、降级颜色，将颜色从RGB888降级为565(反正用不到那么精细)
2、根据构造的过滤器，去掉不需要计算分析的色值；
3、判断过滤后的色值是否符合要求：

1、如果过滤后的色值数量小于设定的最大颜色数量，那么直接返回结果；
2、如果过滤后的色值数量大于设定的最大颜色数量，那么调用quantizePixels量化处理色值：

1、构造一个名为VBox的类，用于存放最大最小色值等信息，方便获取平均值（说白了就是划分区域，将区域信息放到这个类里面）
2、不断寻找色值中点，分割VBox并更新保存的区域信息，直到分割后的VBox数量达到规定的最大颜色数量；
3、计算各个VBox中的平均色值，并返回，即可得到主题色；
感觉搞个流程图看起来比较好？
一句话总结：
说白了，其实思路很简单，将图片经过压缩处理后，划分为规定的区块，最后返回各个区块的颜色平均值；
那么接下来要做的事，就是把原生的代码翻译过来
如果单单是翻译，其实问题不大，简单描述下跟Android中做法不一样的部分：
工具类这块问题不大，区别主要是在读取图片数据这块：
在 Android 中，对图片的操作基本通过的是bitmap来做处理；因此读取图片像素信息，可以通过bitmap.getPixels方法来做；
在 Flutter 中，对图片信息的获取，则是通过Image来做的，以一个本地文件为例：需要这么做：

PS ：另外发现一个小点，不注意的话，还是能带来了一定困扰的：
在Android中，颜色数值是一个int；
在Dart中，也一样是int：
但是Android，或者说java的int和dart的int，范围是不一样的；
举个例子，同样是红色的FF0000，Dart中FF0000的值是: 4294901760 ，而在java中，红色对应的int值是： -65536
所以在开发Dart的过程中，别被java中熟知的int范围影响到了，要不然就会像我一样，调bug的时候，刚上来看到这个数值那叫一个一脸懵逼；
结语
还是老规矩，国际惯例，附上效果图，列表按区块像素数排序（相当于在图片中的权重了）：
首先测试用的图片是这张：

Android的：

Flutter的：

怎么感觉我这个flutter版本的更贴近于主题色呢……这android原生中，黑色区域是第三高的权重，看图片.是这样么？……
不过权重最高的部分，都没什么异议～～～当然，一般我们也不会选权重低的部分当作主题色吧
接下来要做的事，就是分析ImageProvider部分，看下flutter的图片加载流程是什么样的，最后怎么将这个工具类应用到Image小部件上面～
最后呢，首尾呼应，重新回到标题中提到的问题，经过这么一系例处理之后，相信大家已经认可了这套方案并得出了统一的结论：
遇到提这种需求的产品，还是先打一顿比较好，谁打赢了听谁的
更新 ：后来发现其实有个库实现了这个效果…………此题完结

文案6000余字，剪成两个视频是比较合适的，但是up比较讨厌话说一半，就干脆都放出来了，嫌长的同志可以按照兴趣从不同点，后遗症或者人类之光几个部分里自己选择。如果依旧觉得一次性太长的话，一定要和我说哦，下次再写比较长的文案，up就把它分开发~
快过年了，小伙伴们都要假期学知识哦!

如果您觉得视频多少有一点点的帮助的话，别忘了帮up留个三连~！

                    <span>诗词缘起
有的人特别爱吹牛，有的人不喜欢吹牛。
我以前属于前者，但现在是后者。
因为我遇到了一个对的人，我不想骗她。
从爱上她，到现在，直至往后余生，我都在为向她吹的最后一个牛还债。
那个牛皮是这样吹的：

宋词很简单，如果你做我女朋友，以后每个七夕节，我都给你写一首！

没想到，后来我俩真的在一起了，看样子这辈子也会一直在一起。
没办法，为了维持“守信”“才华”人设不塌房，我每年都会强迫自己在七夕节前一两个月切换角色，假装诗人。

10年前还在用手写

2021年已经用app生成了
假装诗人三板斧
不知不觉牛皮吹过了10年，我也写完了10首宋词，说实话很有成就感，但也挺累人的。
因为一个脑袋空空的当代俗人，想要冒充古代文豪不穿帮，需要用很多工具，才能催眠自己“我觉得我挺行”，来维持自己的诗词创作之路：
诗词典籍：假装自己满腹经纶。 用来经常翻阅七夕相关的诗词名作，培养语感。常用工具有宋词三百首、诗经等书籍、以及古诗词典等诗词软件。
词谱韵表：假装自己精通韵律。 用来选择词牌，查找词谱，对应平仄。常用工具有白香词谱、平水韵、中华新韵等书籍和对应软件。
记录创作：假装自己落笔成诗。 用来灵感收集，细化修改。常用工具有纸笔以及word、印象笔记等软件。
迭代：写拉松诗词创作系统
在这十年间，我的创作流程逐渐稳定，但工具层面却常起波澜。一些纸质书籍内容被移动APP替代，也有一批软件逐渐停止维护，一直期待要是有一套自己的诗词创作系统就好了。
今年我福至心灵，在写拉松上试着搭建自己的创作系统，发现竟然非常顺畅，基本能覆盖80%的功能。并且因为这套系统可以在手机上随时执行，对碎片时间的利用率非常高，所以大大缩短了我的创作周期，非常赞。
写拉松是啥？

「这局废了，重开吧。」「我不下车了。」

@潘誉晗：45 路公交车在十字路口爆炸，强烈的火光不仅打破了一日的宁静，也带走了许多人的生命。女大学生李诗情和游戏设计师肖鹤云却从这场爆炸中复活，两人一次次经历爆炸，一次次「死而复生」，却也一次次「开局重来」进入了循环……
这部由正午阳光出品，腾讯独播的开年网剧真的「炸」了，虽然同类型的作品早有《土拨鼠之日》《源代码》和《明日边缘》珠玉在前，可毕竟这是国内第一部循环向的剧集，所以总归有一些带着担忧的期待，但一口气看完八集的感觉很好。而本剧又是以 2013 年的厦门公交爆炸案为原型，所以…</span>

                    <span>一年又一年，Apple 在今天发布了由 iPhone 13 Pro 拍摄的虎年新春影片《卷土重来》，这部影片是 Apple 发布的第五支新春影片，也是与过去四部影片完全不同的一部作品。

首先是时长，《卷土重来》的片长有 23 分钟之久，与之相比，2018 年发布的首支 Apple 新春影片《三分钟》的片长为 7 分钟、去年发布的《阿年》为 12 分钟。其次是类型元素，与过去人物关系、道具场景都相对简单的四部影片不同，我们在《卷土重来》中可以看到传统武打、好莱坞科幻、乡土情怀、幽默喜剧、父子亲情等多种电影风格类型，道具和场景方面包含了机器人和机器狗、全地形车、火星基地、飞船模型等等，制作规模进一步突破。
《卷土重来》讲述的是电影梦碎的儿子，跟一个异想天开的父亲，为了把无人问津的村子打造成网红景点，率领一众村民拍摄火星大电影的故事。身为替身武打演员的儿子，在一次拍摄中不慎受伤之后无奈回村，接受了电影梦破灭现实的他，希望利用多年积攒下来的积蓄，将父亲接去城市生活，告别土地贫瘠、生活环境恶劣的乡村。父亲则希望为乡村拍摄一部影片，希望通过这部影片将乡村走出困境，同时也帮助儿子圆一次电影梦。
影片从父子之间的矛盾作为展开，儿子希望带领父亲逃离「除了沙尘一无所有，荒凉得跟个火星似的」乡村，前往城市生活；父亲则从儿子的话语中收获了不一样的理解：那就拍一部关于「火星」的电影。这里展现的，不仅是现实中父母与子女常有的矛盾冲突，也代表了两代人对于困难、梦想的不一样的看法：20 岁的儿子虽然怀揣电影梦，但是遇到困难就决定接受现实、放弃梦想；60 岁的父亲却对梦想执着追求，不仅希望帮助儿子圆一次电影梦，也对于生活了一辈子的乡村仍抱有希望，对于村民抱有希望。

影片背后留下的不少线索，也埋藏了对于现代生活的各种还原。比如父亲希望拍摄视频放到网上，将村子打造成网红景点，正是当下短视频时代的一种社会缩影…</span>

                    <span>不论身在何处，华人最重要的节日无疑是春节。除夕之夜全家团圆，共同迎接新年的到来。
不过，除夕当日除了准备年夜饭之外，另一项重要的活动就是大扫除。最初是一种祛除病疫的宗教仪式，后来慢慢发展成了必不可少的习俗，被视作是在新年里远离秽气、晦气和穷气的象征。

即使对这样的传统及其附带的意义并不感兴趣，每隔一段时间的大扫除也是十分必要的。对频繁搬家的人来说，至少还可以趁着收拾行李的机会整理、清洁；但如果常年住在同一间房子里，被挡住的卫生死角很容易就被忽视，经年累月下来灰尘和病菌聚集，对居住者的身体健康也会造成一定影响。甚至可以趁着大扫除的时候，对家中物品做个清点，在旧年「断舍离」掉不常用的东西，给家里腾出更多的空间。
接下来将介绍我在大扫除时的一些基本思路，以及一些（希望是）具体可行的操作方法。与上一篇日常家务的文章不同的是，本篇中的清洁会更细致，所需时间更长，体力消耗更大，并且可能需要迁延多日才能完成。
图源：storyset
需要注意的是每个人的房间格局、装修材料、家具设施、使用习惯、清洁要求，以及所在地的气候、习俗、家中人口各有不同，也就带来了清洁方式的差异，请根据自身情况适配。另外，由于笔者近几年来都在国外居住，对国产的家务神器缺乏认知，用的基本上都是最基础的器具，也没有钱买扫地机器人和新风这种所需不菲的设备……如果各位在阅读过程中发现有些问题可以用某种神器替代，也欢迎在评论区喂我安利。（如果直接空投我一个扫地机器人的话也可以！谢谢老板！）
如果以上都可以接受的话，那我们就开始吧！
前置准备
大扫除在所有家务活里并不能算轻松。如果能够提前准备的话，就能减少很多在扫除过程中的困扰。
在这里，「提前准备」包含了两重含义。

                    <span>开始这篇文章之前，先说说这两天我在清理电脑存储上的一个插曲。
有着良好电脑使用习惯的我，直到上一次打开 Mac 的储存空间界面，还始终保持着预留至少 50G 的空间来避免可用存储空间过少造成的「心理健康」问题，直到某天清理电脑无用软件时，突然发现电脑只剩 20G 可用，就在那一瞬间，我觉得我与存储空间的多年战斗宣告完败。
一番排查过后，最占用存储空间的是不出意外的微信和企业微信两大「巨头」，足足有 60G 的空间消耗。这些聊天记录的缓存，在电脑端占用的空间寸土寸金，却不让我十分珍惜，因为他们杂乱无章，脱离了微信就再也无法访问，偶尔同步最近记录还会抽风，语音同步也是个老大难问题，想要全量的聊天记录检索，必须搬出已经占用 10G 的手机微信。
想到前一阵子微信拟推出付费的聊天记录云端存储功能，以及越来越大的微信存储占用，我开始未雨绸缪，考虑谨慎处理我已经愈渐庞大和失控的微信数据。
定期的全量备份以建立保障
微信自带的备份和迁移
因为一直是 iPhone 用户，所以能够采取的备份方案一般也以官方的为主。下图这两个界面应该所有人都不陌生，电脑端提供的一直都是备份和恢复的操作，而如果是换手机的场景，也支持将设备连接到同一 WiFi，直接在手机间迁移聊天记录。这两个方案都能解决问题，但如果聊天记录过多的话，同步速度会不太可控。

说到手机间迁移聊天记录的场景，ColorOS、MIUI 等国内 Android 系统基本都支持微信数据的云端同步功能，部分 Android 系统还支持选择性恢复聊天记录，不仅对于聊天记录的留存多一份保障，还让随时可能过期的临时文件得以自动地存储下来。
相比而言，iOS 虽然也具备机器间数据整体的迁移功能，不过前提是需要借助电脑或 iCloud 云端同步来实现。需要说明的是，iCloud 的备份是对于 iOS 本地文件的「一锅端」，相比微信自带备份功能的缺点是只…</span>

说的就是这位 @东北少女vivian 同学：
可以复刻薛记炒货的网红爆款酸奶柑橘片吗？这玩意100多一斤就那么点…
网上几乎没有可用的方子！
受 @知乎美食  邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，让大家在问题下许愿，一眼我就看到了这个心愿，“酸奶柑橘片”这玩意最近风很大啊不是么？！
其实我早就听说过了，但是我不爱吃桔子就一直没下手，直到看到这个心愿，没忍住剁了下手。
就，妙啊。
柑橘还是那个貌不惊人的柑橘，白巧还是那个甜死人毫不愧疚的白巧，两人一组合，就成了网红零食了，关键是，这网红零食它好吃————
也好贵。

如果说去年过年的年度DIY零食新贵是奶枣，那今年盲猜就是这个了。因为它实在优势太明显：
正好赶上柑橘上市季节、价格便宜、步骤简单、酸甜适口、耐存放、老少咸宜。
于是就决定做这个给你们看了！
嘘，别问原因，问就是家里收了3箱子朋友从各地寄来的桔子、橙子等，我实在消耗不完了（此处感谢 @陈大可 等人提供的原料）。

但是由于对网上教程的极度不信任，我还是用分组法，在不同的步骤试验了很多种方法去制作，旨在让你们看完我这一篇絮絮叨叨的回答就都会做。

所以以下，除了正常的“烘烤柑橘片——融化巧克力——裹巧克力涂层——冷却”这4个谁都能看明白的步骤外，我会在每一个步骤都列出来你可能失败的原因，包括但不仅限于：

1、柑橘的选择——决定成品造型和是否发苦
2、烤箱、果脯机、空气炸锅、电暖气哪家强——决定果干烘烤时间和成色
3、巧克力的选择和配料——决定色泽、脆度和味道平衡
4、冷却时间和注意事项——决定保存时间和口感保持

看到这里，你就已经知道我翻车了多少回才有信心写下这个教程了。

那么，“我去买几个橘子，你就站在此地，不要走动。”[1]

经验分享：


A、车辆的准备


1、轮胎和制动系统
轮胎是汽车唯一与地面接触的零部件，其重要性不言而喻。首先，我们需要保证轮胎胎壁没有鼓包，因为鼓包会直接导致爆胎，车辆会失控。其次，我们要确认轮胎没有过度磨损，如果都快成光头胎了，还是赶紧换掉吧，快过年了，汽修店的人都快手关门回老家啦。再者，我们需要一套胎压监测，这比每次都下车踢一脚轮胎来得靠谱。
出发之前，我们必须到4S店或汽修店检查一下制动系统是否运作正常，刹车片是否已经磨到底了，制动液是否该换了。
.
2、三大件
如果真的要跑很久的长途，不妨提早做一个小保养，换换油水，检查刹车，顺便让4S店或者快修店师傅给你检查一下发动机、变速箱、底盘“三大件”是否性能完备。
谁都不想车子在前不着村后不着店的地方抛锚，这还是春节期间呢，谁来拯救你？钱给够当然有救援，但没人想多花两三倍的钱对吧。

                    <span>哦，这个是我的领域。我暂且认为，我在这个领域，全国范围能排前100问题不大。知乎比我专业的人，应该不会超过10个（我抛砖引玉，其他曾经同行，你们自己看情况）。
我做的是变速箱标定，是某国际大厂，认定的中国区域，仅有的2个驾驶性评估工程师（另外一位是我徒弟）。带我的师傅，是国内某厂混动方案起草人。我一度考虑找自主品牌融资，创业搞变速箱，后来发现自己落后了 ，于是就不搞了，改行了。
通俗的讲，主要解决2个问题， 换挡点+换挡质量。
首先你说的硬件问题， 是很难创新的，ZF的8AT，奇瑞的CVT，爱信6AT，Getrag的7dct也好，他们是设计好变速箱，就疯狂卖，一般6000-15000块一台，价格关键看扭矩，看你采购量。硬件的每个档位的传动比，基本结构，都不会改动了 ，最多改变下和发动机 链接处，就是表面功夫，密封更好这些。主要调整的是软件。
1）先解决有无问题：换挡点
这块需要根据每个发动机来，发动机的万有特性（就是扭矩、转速、油门开度。功率用的其实是很少）
这里面决定了油耗，动力性， 当然你可以设置几套模式，什么雪地模式（2挡起步），运动模式（推迟换挡点），经济模式（早换挡），内部还会存在爬坡等。当然不同厂家逻辑是不一样的，有的是一套图谱，根据运动，经济等修正，有的可能是几套。
但是，这些本质都是有无问题 ，客户根本不关心，车评人也不关心。
要关心的是：换挡质量（从有到优）
2：换挡质量：聪明、迅捷、平顺
最好的换挡，就要像电车那样，客户感知不到，在所有评估里，这个都是10分，因为那是真正的车随脚动，油车即使保时捷帕拉梅拉，也给不了10分。
传统油车有如下几种问题
   2.1：换挡时间问题
    DCT一般最短200毫秒左右，长的话1.5s也是存在的（我们还做过一个2.3s的车）。
你想想，1.5S你怎么接受？一脚下去，1.5S之后车才动
为什么会存在1.5s？因为驾…</span>

                    <span>Java语言提供了synchronized关键字用于加锁，但这种锁一是很重，二是获取时必须一直等待，没有额外的尝试机制。
从Java 5开始，引入了一个处理并发的java.util.concurrent包，它提供了大量更高级的并发功能。其中Lock是juc包下面的一个接口，ReentrantLock是它的常用实现类。
ReentrantLock是一个可重入的，API层面上的互斥锁，用于替代synchronized加锁。它拥有与synchronized相同的并发性和内存语义，但是添加了定时锁等候、可中断锁等候等一些特性。
基本使用
传统synchronized代码：
public class Counter {
    private int count;

    public void add(int n) {
        synchronized(this) {
            count +&#x3D; n;
        }
    }
}

如果用ReentrantLock替代，代码为：
public class Counter {
    private final Lock lock &#x3D; new ReentrantLock();
    private int count;

    public void add(int n) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
        // synchronized do something
            count +&#x3D; n;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

synchronized 是 Java 语言层面提供的一个关键字，锁和获取和释放都不需要显式调用，在异常时…</span>

一、概述
1.1 描述
上文介绍到了SQLite Api，今天咱们介绍一下 Room ( Android Jetpack 重要成员之一 )。
Room 持久性库在 SQLite 之上提供了一个抽象层，以允许流畅的数据库访问，同时利用 SQLite 的全部功能。特别是，Room 提供以下好处：
SQL 查询的编译时验证。
方便的注释，最大限度地减少重复和容易出错的样板代码。
简化的数据库迁移路径。
由于这些考虑，我们强烈建议您使用 Room 而不是直接使用 SQLite API。
1.2 主要部件
Room 包含三个主要组件：
保存数据库并用作与应用程序持久数据的底层连接的主要访问点的数据库类。
表示应用数据库中表的数据实体。
数据访问对象(DAO)，提供你的应用可用于在数据库中查询、更新、插入和删除数据的方法。
数据库类为您的应用程序提供与该数据库关联的 DAO 实例。反过来，应用程序可以使用 DAO 从数据库中检索数据作为关联数据实体对象的实例。该应用程序还可以使用定义的数据实体来更新相应表中的行，或创建新行以进行插入。下图说明了 Room 不同组件之间的关系。

二、创建 Room
2.1 添加依赖项
在 app/build.gradle文件中添加依赖：
dependencies {
    //Room
    def room_version &#x3D; &quot;2.4.1&quot;
    implementation &quot;androidx.room:room-runtime:$room_version&quot;
    annotationProcessor &quot;androidx.room:room-compiler:$room_ver…</span>

                    <span>0 写在最前面
2021年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔1-2年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在16至25岁间萌出，此时人的生理、心理发育都接近成熟，有“智慧到来”的象征，因此被俗称为“智齿”。智齿生长方面，个体有很大差异，通常情况下应该有上下左右对称的4颗牙，有的少于4颗甚至没有，极少数人会多于4颗。萌出的年龄差异也很大，有的人20岁之前萌出，有人40到50岁才长或者终生不长，这都是正常现象。1

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://sspai.com/post/71062">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>什么是自定义短语
macOS 与 iOS 中的键盘设置中，都有 【自定义短语】这个功能。
这个功能有什么用呢，可以很方便的输入平时常用的一些词条，比如你的住址，或邮箱。
该功能是这样的，定义一个输入码比如 mail 定义它的替换文本为 kylebingbing@163.com，这样，在你输入 mail 的时候就会被自动替换成你的邮箱。
macOS 中是这样的
 

iOS 中是这样的
 

macOS 与 iOS 的键盘中的自定义短语是同步的。所以在 macOS 上导入的短语也会出现在同账号下的 iOS 系统中。
我的需求
我是五笔用户，iOS上用的是原生的五笔输入法，但这个输入法有个问题，就是词库无法自定义，所以我就瞄准了输入法中的这个 【自定义短语】功能。我需要往里导入非常多的词几百几千或几万，一个一个加是不可能了。
上面我们已经知道 macOS 与 iOS 的自定义短语是同步的，所以只需要在 macOS 上导入词条就可以了，幸运的是 macOS 是可以批量导入的。
一、自定义短语的位置
macOS

打开键盘设置
切换标签到 自定义短语
往里面添加就可以了

iOS

打开设置
打开 【通用设置】
找到【键盘】
再点击【自定义短语】

二、如何导入导出词条
批量导入导出词条只能在 macOS 中操作
1. 导出

打开自定义短语的窗口
command + a 选中所有词条，
然后拖动这些词条到桌面，即可导出词条到桌面，此时会生成一个 .plist 的文件，其文件的内容格式如下






phrase
kylebing@163.com
shortcut
mail


phrase
自定义短语
shortcut
tpyy




观察这个文件结构可以看到它是由 phrase 和 shortcut 两个字段组成的。
2. 导入
你可以上面的文件结构生成自己的 .plist 文件。
导入的方法跟导出正好相反，直接拖动 .plist 文件到 自定义短语的窗口中即可，系统还会自动查重。
三、批量处理词条的工具
工具地址：
 
 
介绍一下我做的一个可以批量处理词条的工具。它可以将批量词条生成到一个 plist 文件中，直接拖动导入到自定义短语中就可以了。
比如我有这些词条需要导入，目前只有 编码-短语 这种结构，需要生成 .plist 那种 xml 结构

只需要选中需要导入的词条，点击 【导出为 .plist 文件】即可

只需要拖动生成的文件到自定义短语的窗口中，即可完成批量导入

                    <span>李想最近在微博上很活跃。
2022 年 1 月 11 日的下午，李想在理想汽车内部一个主动安全主题的飞书群看到了一个懂车帝的视频链接，视频的标题很长：「2021 年度新能源、AEB、性能车型及发动机评选」，但对于李想来说，题眼无非是 3 个字母：AEB。
AEB，全称 Autonomous Emergency Braking，自动紧急制动系统。在车辆行驶的过程中，如果有追尾的风险，但驾驶员又没踩刹车亦或是踩了但力度不够，都会触发 AEB，大力制动以避免追尾。
在刚刚过去的 2021 年，懂车帝测试了超过 100 款车的 AEB，测试的项目纷繁复杂，既有儿童鬼探头、隧道 AEB，也有消失的前车、50% 追尾，这些测试远远超出了全球各国的碰撞安全评测机构布置的「考题」，以更加贴合中国交通场景的测试对 AEB 进行极限考验。
那支视频的结论是：2021 款理想 ONE 打败了进入前五的华晨宝马 5 系、华晨宝马 X3、斯巴鲁傲虎和沃尔沃 XC60，成为懂车帝 2021 年 AEB 测试表现最好的车型。
几个小时后，李想发微博表达了对智能驾驶团队的认可：「自从能够开展全栈自研以后，团队在算法和控制的进步速度远远超过了我的想象」。
对于李想，乃至理想汽车这家公司来说，这无疑是一场小小的胜仗。尤其是考虑到就在一年前的 2020 年 12 月底，理想才和视觉感知供应商 Mobileye 分手，站在一穷二白从头来的白纸前。
为什么是理想？
一切都要回到一年前的那个年底。和 Mobileye 一年多来的合作已经让理想「忍无可忍」：这家从以色列起步的视觉感知供应商以其高效、可靠的算法敲开了诸多主流汽车制造商的大门，其中也包括年轻的理想汽车，但因为其高度封闭的合作策略，理想汽车在收集到用户端反馈的一些 Bug 后，却不被允许基于 Mobileye 的算法基础进行持续的迭代开发，以修复这些 Bug…</span>

                    <span>前言 | 正经人就该写日记
有个老梗：“正经人谁写日记？下贱！”
虽然是句调侃，但确实让不少人对写日记这件事情生畏和误解。生畏，是把写日记当成羞耻，生怕被人发现；误解，是以为写日记就是自我内心世界的描绘，和不可告人的秘密。
其实，凡是喜欢写所谓“走心” 日记的，往往是三天打鱼两天晒网的人。能让你坚持写一生的日记，一定不是靠情绪和修辞构建出来的，而是由事件组成的。
真正的日记，写的不是瞬息万变的情绪，也不是无病呻吟的自虐剖析，而是忠实记录某个时间，发生了某件与己相关的事，仅此而已。
所以，只有不正经的人才羞于将自己的经历记录下来，咱正经人，写个日记，堂堂正正，坦坦荡荡，有什么可害臊的呢？

所谓日记，一言以蔽之，就是按照时间顺序所书写的个人经历记录，就是与时间不同的“自己”这个“别人”进行的笔谈
——《智识的生产技术》，梅棹忠夫

接下来，咱们进入正题，讲3件事：

一 | 为什么要写日记？
季羡林日记
如果用一个形象的比喻，来揭示日记与记录者的关系的话，可以这样认为：

日记是一座个人的档案馆。

为什么这么说呢？
人的记忆是非常不可靠的，它既疯狂遗忘，又肆意拼凑。如果我们在事件发生时，不留下实体的信息，仅仅靠自己的记忆来形成对真实世界的印象，无疑将是变形和残缺的。
而通过写日记，将我们在线性时间旅程中的经历，变成不同时间节点的信息沉淀下来，就构建了我们的个人档案馆，是对人生的真实备份。
我们通过一张张的时间切片，不仅可以看到结果，还能追溯其真实发生的过程，从而获得更多对未来的启发。
如果说三维世界是高维世界的投影，那么日记就是我们三维人所能掌握的一种对高维世界的透视技巧。
通过日记建立个人档案馆，我们可以在一定程度上摆脱三…</span>

                    <span>“您平时身体好吗？”“身体好的很，从来没生过病。”“您这牙之前疼过吗？”“疼过。”“那这不是生过病吗？”“这可算不上病吧。”“您可别小看这牙痛，您现在这问题就是牙痛没有及时处理导致的，需要手术治疗了。”“这么严重啊。”“那可不，可别不把牙痛不当病啊。”

这样的对话，在如今的口腔门诊上，屡见不鲜。随着社会发展、物质富足，人们糖摄取量明显增多，食物越来越精细，生活压力越来越大，相应的，口腔问题（包括但远不仅限于牙痛）也如影随形。然而，好好刷牙并非包治百病，贵的牙膏并不会比便宜的牙膏有更好的效果，口腔卫生知识的缺失，让很多人忽视本该处理的口腔问题，错过最佳的治疗机会，延误病情，带来更为严重的后果。这篇文章中，我希望能够通过简单易懂的方式，一次性给你说清楚看牙这个问题。
口腔医生究竟能看哪些疾病？
每种医生都有自己的管辖范围，这个范围在各国之间可能都存在差异。去到医院，看到“琳琅满目”的科室和医生列表，你是否也曾疑惑过，我究竟应该挂哪个科？
中国的口腔医生，可不只会看牙。
在中国，口腔医生这个职业，和美国的 dentist（A dentist is a person who is qualified to examine and treat people&#x27;s teeth.）是有明显区别的，这个区别具体就体现在诊疗范围上。现代中国口腔医学的体系，脱胎于前苏联，除了dentist涉及的范围（主要就是口腔及牙齿）外，还包括口腔颌面外科的内容。也就是说，口腔医生中，有一类是外科医生，也就是大家眼里那种会上手术台，会拿手术刀的医生。
大半个头都归口腔医生管。
头，这样一个全身最为精密的部位，医学上也分工明确。有头发覆盖的区域（颅骨+大脑），归神经外科管辖，但注意，请不要使用现有的发量去进行判断，这可能会导致不准确的结论，同时头发和头皮的问题，可能需要咨询皮肤科的医生（我不说是什么问题）。眼…</span>

                    <span>前序
在第一篇「复制清单」文章发布后，我收到很多用户的留言和建议，大部分人都希望清单能支持连续复杂粘贴。
由于iOS系统有很多安全限制，应用只能读取当前复制的内容，无法在后台连续读取剪切板。不过，方法总比困难多，在我翻阅了大量文档和资料后，「复制清单」终于成功支持后台连续复制粘贴。
非常激动地告诉大家: iOS也有像安卓一样，可以实时保存复制内容的剪切板应用了！
开启后台剪切板

打开应用选择右边剪切板工作栏，点击「开启后台剪切板」。

 
2. 点击开启后台剪切板后，顶部会出现一个悬浮条显示「等待复制」，它会实时显示你复制的内容，右滑可将它最小化。点击悬浮框左上角的「✖️』可关闭后台复制功能。

 
 
3. 切换到其他的应用复制文本，应用会实时读取剪切板，并保存文本到应用。应用将按顺序批量保存剪切板内容， 点右边的小箭头可最大化悬浮框。

 
 
 
4. 切换到清单键盘，选择第一个&#x27;剪切板&#x27;分类，在这个分类可以看到刚批量复制的文本，点击就可以输入。

 
 
5.  如果剪切板的内容很多，支持左滑动创建一条新的清单，或者长按呼出批量创建和删除功能，可快速地对内容进行归类整理。
 

 
 
写在最后
非常感谢曾给我留言的用户们，这让我对核心功能进行了重新思考。希望大家继续提供有用的建议，一起帮助完善复制清单。

                    <span>2022年2月4日-2022年2月20日，第24届冬季奥林匹克运动会（简称「北京冬奥会」）将在北京和张家口两地联合举办。
2022年3月4日-2022年3月13日，第13届冬季残疾人奥林匹克运动会（简称「北京冬残奥会」）也将在上述两市举办。
冬奥在即，你可曾完整、系统地了解过北京冬奥会？你知道北京冬奥会的火炬叫什么名字吗？冬残奥的吉祥物「xuě róng róng」怎么写吗？你知道冬奥特许商品吗？
看了上面的问题，你可能会一脸问号：「北京冬奥会不就是一场运动会吗，还有这么多周边产品吗？」
答案是肯定的。如果你想了解这些「周边」的话，接下来我将带你探寻这片未知世界。
非商品类
会徽
北京冬奥会的会徽名为「冬梦」，设计灵感源于中国汉字「冬」，在经过设计之后使会徽兼具东方文化和现代风格，整体看起来像两个运动员（上半部分为滑冰运动员，下半部分为滑雪运动员），中间的线条「代表举办地起伏的山峦、赛场、冰雪滑道和节日飘舞的丝带」。该会徽的主题色彩为蓝色，寓意「梦想与未来」，红、黄两色则选于中国国旗，代表「运动的激情、青春与活力」。
冬梦
北京冬残奥会的会徽名为「飞跃」，以汉字「飞」为设计本体，在调整汉字结构后展现了其动感和力度，展现了一位正奋力冲向终点的残疾人运动员。它「整体充满了昂扬向上之激情，奋进飞跃之动感，色彩丰富，构图完美，象征并激发运动员以坚强的意志作为精神的翅膀，在冬残奥赛场上放飞青春梦想」。
飞跃
以上两个会徽（矢量文件）都能在北京冬奥组委官网下载。（友情提示：若要使用，请遵守会徽规范手册使用）
火炬
北京冬奥会的火炬名叫「飞扬」。此火炬以祥云纹样“打底”，自下而上，从祥云纹逐渐过渡到雪花图案，最后在顶端化身为飞扬的火焰。祥云纹恰好与2008年北京奥运会主火炬塔呼应，凸显了北京「双奥之城」的特点。

                    <span>人在北京，开过上百款车，自己分别有前驱SUV、后驱轿车和电动车，聊聊经验。
东北有句老话：一猪二熊三老虎。不是真的说野猪的战斗力秒杀东北虎，而是人遇到野猪，往往不如遇到老虎那么害怕，结果被野猪挑死了。
按照不同天气，对应的警惕程度应该是这样的顺序：
雪天＜雨天＜雨夹雪＜冷雾
雪天好说，地上都白了，是个智商正常的都知道该慢，提高预判警醒着开。雨天要比雪天更小心，因为车速高了之后，轮胎会与地面之间形成一层薄薄的水膜，导致附着力大幅下降，但很多人开车的时候有种操蛋的逻辑，感觉破水而行很爽，甚至故意加速压水坑，要是赶上单侧轮胎水坑里踩油门，那就离失控不远了。
所以相比下雪，雨天更应该提高警惕。
接下来是雨夹雪，这种情况就像过地雷阵，很难判断前方路面到底是水，还是冰层，还是冰水混合物。雨夹雪最可怕的是，不像雪天那样，司机会一直保持警惕。很多司机遇到雨夹雪，刚一开始心里还挺紧张，聚精会神，越开心里越放松。车速提升、预判变短，甚至回到常规驾驶习惯，以至于前方车辆减速时，自己的车刚好处于冰水混合的路面，只能眼看着爆前车菊。
我曾经跑高速，真实的经历告诉我，最可怕的天气是冷雾，为什么呢？冷雾一般发生在深夜和凌晨，诱因大概是某个区域短时间内气温骤降，导致瞬间起了大雾。雾天开车各位都知道该怎么操作吧？打开前后雾灯，慢速行驶，非必要不开双闪。
但突发性的冷雾，大家都把注意力放在视线上了，却漏掉了一个特别重大的危险隐患——路面凝水/结霜。这种情况比雨夹雪形成的暗冰更可怕，因为在深夜凌晨，路面是否凝水结霜几乎没法分辨，这时候一脚刹车下去，如果是结霜路面，车辆特别容易启动ABS和EBD，一些经验不足的司机就慌了，因为这种表现和他们的心理预期极不相符：
不就是下雾了么，为什么刹不住车了？
经验不够的司机这时候就特别容易慌，从而出现乱打方向等谜之操作，进而导致事故。
最后附上我很久以前经历并总结的一次道路结冰导致七车连追事故：

                    <span>我喜欢这句话，“我们无权评论别人的人生，同理别人也不可以。”
肯定有许多人会过来阴阳怪气，“那可真是无权”（评论区果为如此，承认自己可能是特别难的一件事）。
不患人之不己知，患其不能也。
因为没有人能够比事主自己更了解自己，所以没法评价人生；对于同理，假装情绪去“可怜或者怜惜”我觉得想必都是虚伪的：不知他人苦，无法同理。
在不违法的前提下，做任何事情都是自己的自由，网间相传的事情，狗头萝莉这样一位主播何尝不是类似于“陈冠希门”一般的受害者呢？
关于早年的猥亵和强奸，既然已经在网上公开，不妨报警，众所周知，无论猥亵还是强奸如果要走法律程序，那么其重点就是证据。想要证明犯罪事实，至少要有以下核心证据中的几个形成证据体系：

医院病历以及报告单（可能非常不容易取到，时间已经相隔太久）
被告人的供述以及辩解（有大概率可以取得）
受害人的陈述以及辨认笔录（确凿取得）
案发现场勘验检查笔录以及照片（难以取得）
能够证明双方是否发生性关系的精斑检验鉴定意见书（难以取得）
能够证明被告人是否采取暴力、胁迫或其他手段以威吓受害人的证人证言（可能可以取得）
能够证明受害人是否曾通过微信、短信和电话等方式向外传递求救信息的证人证言（刑事侦查可以恢复电子数文）
能够证明受害人是否存在反抗、胁迫等迹象的案发现场（酒店入口、走廊）监控视频

在以上证据的采集上，毋庸置疑，警方是十分专业的。然而由于本事件自发生到报警，时间间隔已经较长了，部分证据的取得可能难度颇大，不过在知乎依旧怀有热情的时代，我想会有无数愿意给予协助帮助的人。
当然，关于刑事方面的建议我还是更为推荐去做专业咨询（我只能大体给一点点提示，这不是我擅长的领域，可以咨询两位女律师 @黄小牛 @王逸然 ）。
关于高额违约金，涉及违约要付出的成本，让狗头萝莉背上高额违约金的原因是合同约定发生根本性违约时应当支付高额违约金——这件事情愿打愿挨，没有什么办法。
虽然都说，违约金，性质上以补偿性为主，惩罚性为辅。
但实际里面，无论是法院判决还是仲裁，其实都会基于会综合考虑实际损失、履行情况、过错程度、预期利益等因素，并根据公平和诚实信用原则进行认定。
其中会重点考虑主播的知名程度、主播的主观过错、平台对主播培养和人气维系的情况、平台基于连续性合同履行所产生的预期利益损失。
从合作之初，其实甲方设计来说，本就是律师通过精巧的合同设计来约束主播，而主播的行为被装进款式多样的违约套餐中。
稍有不慎，就会触发高额索赔。
纵然知道违约金很高，然而主播还是得签：无他，双方地位本来初始就不平等。
当然，对于类似虎牙平台的资源倾斜来说（一个主播很多时候都是资源堆出来的），确实也具有设置高额违约金的必要性。
以主播韦朕8522万天价违约金案为例，裁判机构一般会认为直播作为新兴产业具有较强的行业特点，直播平台对主播依赖性较强且行业间竞争激烈，平台经营者需要投入大量人力物力进行主播的推广和人气维系，顶级主播的直播间观看人数和粉丝数量对平台利益具有重大隐形关联。
当然我想最开始签约的时候，狗头萝莉甚至不能完全理解合约对于自身的限制程度（比如私德条款之类纵然明星都不了解，何况一个游戏主播）。
可是她既然在网络上说了她的过往，我想从法律上也许不是她不懂，而是已经失去了心气，这个时候的她，依旧还希望有人会倾泻予她以阳光。
想起有个KWM的姑娘很善良，前天转过来她直播时候的视频，并评论“唏嘘于人生的不同，但是可以从泫然欲泪里感受不甘，以及无法脱身”。
面包和牛奶都会有的，要振作起来，自己可以拯救自己，做一个你曾经想要成为的，能给大家带来更多美好的人吧。

                    <span>大家好，我是《画江湖之不良人》第五季的导演兼半拉编剧，李帅帅。（开场白直接扒的舒导，实在太难想了！）
犹记得当初舒导被市场的大佬们围在会议室写知乎的窘境，犹记得我叼着烟嘲笑的嘴脸，犹记得市场大佬那略有深意的回眸现在回想起来让我倍感深刻。



在唠些有营养的之前，请容我唠叨两句，谁叫你们给我吐槽的机会呢~
时间回溯到不良人4播出之时，在4收获不错的口碑背后，大家不知道的是我们透支了什么，公司开始动荡，而我，正准备离职。就在这个时候，关导和舒导找到了我。
对面是劈着大腿的关导，一旁是面色苍白挂着诡异笑容的舒导。
关：“帅啊，你来导不良人5吧。”
我：“哦，啊？”
这时办公室门开了，端着茶杯的周导走到我身后，吐了口茶叶。
周：“别怕，我带你。”
我：“我…”
周：“哦对了，是5和6啊。”
那个时候我早就知道做原创动画不赚钱，但是我更想不明白的是这帮人从几十人干到四百多人又掉到一百多人……还tm搞原创，这不疯了吗？
后来我明白了，凤凰啊，是需要涅槃的。
就这样，我接过了接力棒，是整体制作周期缩减一半的不良人5、6。
你们看我说的挺热血，真到开干的时候，真的太难了。首先的难题就是人员配置，动荡期我们流失了大量第4季的班底，为了增强画质我们还换了新流程，这让整个项目充满了大量的不确定性，我们要在更短的周期内，不断试错，同时还要保持制作水准。就这样，我还将画幅提升到了21:9，为此制片部门还开了大会。
翁总监：“ 21:9 ，代价是什么？”
我：“（小心翼翼）拍到的东西会更多，但是画面会更有张力，更贴近电影，更能凸显我们的画质，增强沉浸感blablabla……”
在座鸦雀无声，我艹我当时紧张的不行。
翁总监：“艹，干了！”
首当其冲的就是资产，新流程下，我们以前的所有资产积累都需要更新，没有一样可以直接用（感谢大个儿和小倩，资产组一度就八个人，兄弟们太难了）。尽管如此，我们还要更进一步…</span>

12月23日，国务院新闻办公室举行新闻发布会，介绍北京冬奥会和冬残奥会疫情防控政策及相关筹备工作。北京市卫生健康委员会副主任、新闻发言人李昂就如何做好北京冬奥医疗救治保障工作回答了记者提问。


李昂表示，北京市按照《奥运会指南—医疗服务》和《国际雪联医疗保障指南》要求，本着“简约、安全、精彩”办赛理念，按照精准、安全、高效的分类施治策略，做好冬奥医疗救治保障，重点开展了四个方面的工作：
一是完善了医疗救治资源配置。在竞赛场馆设置固定医疗站、比赛场地医疗站、观众医疗站等，北京赛区和延庆赛区共设置88个医疗站，提供现场医疗急救及伤病员分流转运工作。从17家定点医院和2家院前急救机构选拔1140名医疗骨干作为场馆医疗保障人员，配置457名院级后备力量；从12家三级医院抽选120名医护人员组建市级后备队；配备场馆救护车74辆，其中负压救护车54辆。按照冬奥疫情防控政策要求，协同北京冬奥组委将涉冬奥伤病员分为新冠肺炎确诊与疑似患者、闭环内的发热症状患者、闭环内其他伤病员、闭环外的发热症状患者、闭环外其他伤病员等五类，调整优化定点医院收治任务，18家定点医院实施精准分类收治，避免不同风险伤病员流线交叉。赛时将从定点医院抽调1188名医务人员、840名院内专家，提供及时、高效的医疗服务，同时，60名市级专家、10名院士给予高水平技术支持。
二是制定了“一场一策”和“一院一策”医疗保障方案。针对每一场所比赛运动损伤特点，专门配备了骨科、口腔科等学科医务人员。同时，在冰球场馆增配CT、牙椅等设备，结合场所环境特点，开展有针对性的现场急救演练，实现“一场一策”医疗保障。为发挥专业学科优势，提高医疗救治能力，定点医院制定了“一院一策”医疗保障方案，北京大学第三医院延庆医院将1.2万平方米的独立病房楼改建为冬奥医疗中心，设置72张病床，配套CT和核磁等设备、手术室、核酸采样、发热门诊等；北京安贞医院腾退104张床位改造为冬奥专区；北京大学人民医院、北京朝阳医院、北京世纪坛医院等调整院内布局，设置病房专区，配备专用CT、核磁等设备，建设负压杂交手术室，为冬奥医疗救治提供有力保障。
三是加强了冬奥村综合诊所建设。建成了1500平方米的北京冬奥村综合诊所和1658平方米的延庆冬奥村综合诊所，覆盖急诊、理疗康复、影像、中医、牙科等18个学科，满足赛时每日16 小时基本门诊和24小时紧急救治需求。目前，北京冬奥村综合诊所医疗设备调试已完成；延庆冬奥村综合诊所CT、核磁、DR方舱已调试到位，保证赛时急诊、门诊、康复转院等医疗救治工作有序开展。
四是强化了培训演练和血液保障。按照全员培训、内外结合原则，加大医疗保障人员冬奥知识、英语水平、滑雪技能等内容培训，40名滑雪医生达到国际救援水平，1900名医疗保障人员具备基础急救能力。市红十字血液中心建立赛时调血机制，Rh阴性血液持续保持在1800～2000单位。
北京市将统筹全市医疗资源，全力做好冬奥会、冬残奥会医疗救治保障工作，为各国运动员和国际友人提供优质高效的医疗救治保障。

冬奥会的到来，不仅让更多的孩子感受到冰雪运动的乐趣，更为孩子们树立了新的奋斗目标。

在南京奥体中心，就有这样一群孩子，即使懵懵懂懂，却对未来能站上冬奥赛场充满期待。

    从黑龙江省七台河市走出的世界冠军张杰，是两届世界大冬会女子3000米接力冠军队成员，曾在短道速滑世锦赛中打破世界纪录。

    2014年，张杰回到家乡七台河，利用学习多年的运动康复技能组建了一支由残障孩子组成的短道速滑队，不拿薪金，义务执教。

    这支由残障孩子组成的短道速滑队成员曾在2017年第11届世界冬季特奥会的速度滑冰项目中斩获4金2银，又在2019年第15届世界夏季特奥会的速度轮滑项目中获得3金2银2铜的好成绩。

    世界冠军培养出了世界冠军。对此，张杰却说，金牌不重要，只要孩子们收获快乐就好。
    从七台河出发，张杰在赛场上为国争光。荣誉加身，她又为爱折返，为“折翼天使”插上梦想的翅膀，成为家乡冰雪运动“火种”的播撒者。“我所有的快乐、幸福和人生感悟都是滑冰带给我的，滑冰是我的全部。”张杰说。

                    <span>去年当爹了，说实话哪怕1个孩子，我都觉得自己的轿车空间有些捉襟见肘。带娃家庭对于空间的需求提升，远不止一个座位+儿童安全座椅那么简单，而是伴娃左右的各种杂七杂八，都得有地方妥妥安置。
我就想，以后三胎家庭越来越多，要应付3个孩子的日常出行，这样的SUV有吗？于是我罗列了大家庭SUV的实用条件：

绝对空间一定要够；
相对空间，也就是内部灵活性必须有，能让车主自己组合布局；
人性化设计，包括按键布局、随手就能利用的储物格等等，很考验厂商的用户思维；
在满足以上三点的基础上，车辆的智能化也可以为出行提供便利，这项并非强求。


离家不远就有很多4S店，带着这些需求，我“假模假式”探访了一波，结果被一款即将上市的新车按住了，它就是一汽－大众旗舰SUV——揽境。这款车指导价为29.99~39.99万元，不到30万就能入手的德系大块头，值得细细品味！

而且我发现，这次一汽-大众为揽境邀请的品牌代言人于和伟，从某种程度上讲与车辆的定位十分契合。于和伟属于可塑性很高的演技派，从《大宅门》里吐口水的白占安，到《新三国》里“接着奏乐接着舞”的刘备，戏路实在是广。反过来看，揽境是定位于大家庭兼商务的全能旗舰SUV，于和伟站在揽境旁边，显然可以突出后者的全能属性——力图满足客户所有用车场景。

绝对空间 | 随便折腾！

这家店有两台揽境，一台作为展车摆在显眼的位置，另一台即将办好上路手续。一汽-大众的店员很热情，把车洗好了让我独自享受！时间有限，我马上按照大家庭SUV的使用条件，一项一项“折腾”起来。
一汽-大众揽境 前两排空间展示
首先是前排空间，调整好坐姿后，身高1.68米的我头部距离车顶尚有两拳距离。这是在我意料之中的，因为揽境的车身高度接近1.8米，对于身高1.9米以下的人来说都是完全够用的。

保持驾驶位座椅不变，来到第二排。揽境采用2+2+2的6座布局形式，且全系可以选装7座。这…</span>

                    <span>从海南度假回来有 2 个月了，但我仍然时常想起在海口的最后一个夜晚，那个大爷真是给我留下了深刻的印象。

在到海口之前，我已经在三亚和万宁待了挺长时间，对海滩，寄居蟹，椰子和清补凉已经不再像刚来时候那么热衷，而寒冷，干燥，昂贵又逼仄的北京，却非常奇怪的对我产生了越来越大的吸引力，总之，我是想回去了。

最后一个晚上，是在海口，我找了机场附近的一个民宿，好在第二天天亮之后更方便的去机场，然后回到阔别已久的北京。

民宿在一片别墅区里，即便是在别墅区里，这样的一座4层的小楼，也显得很有气派，装修的不算豪华，但很舒服。院子里则停着 4 辆奔驰 GLS。我在订这个民宿的时候，看到评论里说，这个民宿会免费用奔驰接送机，我倒不是图这个，主要是想，虽然有点不可思议，但能用奔驰接送机的民宿，其他方面按理不应该太差。

我被安排到了 4 楼的房间，我简单收拾了一下，出门遛了个弯。

遛弯结束后，我没立刻回房间，一楼有一个挺大的餐厅，我准备把中午没喝完的粥继续喝两口，进餐厅的时候我发现，已经坐了两个人，一个年纪大点，是个大爷，一个年纪小点，是个大叔，他们前面也摆了好些菜，不过这餐桌这么大，也不妨碍我，我坐到离他们稍远些的位置，然后开始喝粥。

为什么不到房间里喝呢？因为刚入住的时候，前台就告诉我，为了保持整体清洁，老板禁止客人在房间里吃饭。

喝了几口粥后，桌上的大爷跟我闲聊，问我从哪来，玩几天，什么时候走，我应付了两句之后，问他，你是这里的老板吧？大爷听到我的话一愣，然后哈哈大笑，说我不是，我是个打杂的，老板是旁边这个。

旁边的大叔连连摆手，说大爷才是老板，自己只是打工的。

聊了两句之后，大爷似乎有点兴致，邀请我一起喝酒，我注意到大爷已经开了一瓶红酒，但我不太好意思，就推辞了一下，大爷很热情，直接让大叔给我倒上了一杯端了过来，然后大叔有事就先走了。

                    <span>These days, we all have a few dozen passwords. Fortunately, the bulk of those passwords are probably for websites, and you probably access most websites through your internet browser, and most browsers have a built-in password manager. The most common internet browsers also have a synchronization feature to help you distribute your passwords between the browsers you run across all your devices, so you&#x27;re never without your login information when you need it.

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第3天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。

📢前言

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第63天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：有效的字母异位词
给定两个字符串 s 和 t ，编写一个函数来判断 t 是否是 s 的字母异位词。
注意：若 s 和 t 中每个字符出现的次数都相同，则称 s 和 t 互为字母异位词。
示例1:
输入: s &#x3D; &quot;anagram&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;nagaram&quot;
输出: true

示例2:
输入: s &#x3D; &quot;rat&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;car&quot;
输出: false

提示：
1 代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t)
    {
        List indexS &#x3D; new List();
        List indexT &#x3D; new List();

        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：72 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了82.28%的用户
内存消耗：39 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了7.60%的用户

🌻Java 方法一：排序
思路解析
t 是 s 的异位词等价于「两个字符串排序后相等」。因此我们可以对字符串 s 和 t 分别排序，看排序后的字符串是否相等即可判断。
此外，如果 s 和 t 的长度不同，t 必然不是 s 的异位词。
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() !&#x3D; t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] str1 &#x3D; s.toCharArray();
        char[] str2 &#x3D; t.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(str1);
        Arrays.sort(str2);
        return Arrays.equals(str1, str2);
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：3 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了74.73%的用户
内存消耗：38.5 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了67.34%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( nlogn )
空间复杂度：O( long n )

🌻Java 方法二：哈希
思路解析
t 是 s 的异位词等价于「两个字符串中字符出现的种类和次数均相等」。
由于字符串只包含 26个小写字母，因此我们可以维护一个长度为 26 的频次数组 table，先遍历记录字符串 s 中字符出现的频次，然后遍历字符串 t，减去 table 中对应的频次，如果出现table[i]代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() !&#x3D; t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] str1 &#x3D; s.toCharArray();
        char[] str2 &#x3D; t.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(str1);
        Arrays.sort(str2);
        return Arrays.equals(str1, str2);
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：4 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了45.11%的用户
内存消耗：38.5 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了73.10%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( nlogn )
空间复杂度：O( long n )

CameraX 是一个为了简化编写相机应用而设计的支持库，它所提供的高级 API 可以让开发者专注于和用户交互而非相机的内部实现。我们一直在探索并修复其背后复杂的兼容性问题，让每个新版本都得以在更多的设备上稳定运行。
何时使用 CameraX 或 Camera2，这取决于您期望更快的开发速度或是想要更高的自定义程度。
CameraX 可以很方便地实现普通照片视频的拍摄功能，而 Camera2 则可以对拍摄流程进行特殊控制，例如实现多重曝光或全手动捕获；
CameraX 旨在消除不同设备间的差异并在不同设备上进行了测试，而 Camera2 则需要应用来管理不同设备间的差异并测试其行为；
CameraX 提升了代码开发速度，让您更专注于用户界面和体验流程，而 Camera2 则用于更深入地开发以创造基于相机的定制功能；
CameraX 发布新版本频繁，而 Camera2 则随着 Android 的版本而更新；
CameraX 可以在您不熟悉相机的情况下也能够进行开发，而 Camera2 则需要您对相机的专业知识有更深层次的了解。

CameraX 基于主要的使用场景来构建，比如实时预览相机、检索缓冲区以进行分析和拍摄照片，在 CameraX 1.1 版本中还加入了视频拍摄功能。我们来看一个简单的 CameraX 示例:

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第3天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
前言
作为开发者，单例这个就再也熟悉不过了，但是作为多种单例实现模式，我个人觉得双重校验锁是非常不多的实现，我们简单来分析一下其原理。
正文
先来说一下Java版本的，后面会涉及Kotlin中的代码我们再做比对。
代码实现
Java代码实现如下：
//双重校验锁单例
public class SingleInstance {
    //必须volatile修饰 见分析1
    private volatile static SingleInstance instance;
    //私有化构造函数
    private SingleInstance() {
    }

    public static SingleInstance getInstance() {
        //第一个判空 见分析2
        if (instance &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
            synchronized (SingleInstance.class) {
                //第二个判空 见分析3
                if (instance &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
                    //新建实例
                    instance &#x3D; new SingleInstance();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

首先这里synchronized关键字没有修饰整个getInstance函数，因为这个函数可能使用地方很多，这样就会造成其他线程阻塞，不太好，所以这里只同步了一段代码。
分析2：为什么在进入同步代码块时需要进行进行判空，假如有线程A和线程B，这时线程A先判断instance为null，所以它进入了同步代码块，创建了对象，然后线程B再进来时，它就不必再进入同步代码快了，可以直接返回，也其实也就是懒加载，可以加快执行速度。
分析3：为什么在同步代码块中还要再进行一次判断呢，假如有线程A和线程B，它俩A先调用方法，B紧接着调用，这时A、B在分析2出的判空都是空，所以A进入同步代码块，B进行等待，当A进入同步代码块中创建了对象后，A线程释放了锁，这时B再进入，如果这时不加分析3的判空，B又会创建一个实例，这明显不符合规矩。
分析1：那既然加了2层判断，那为什么还要加个volatile关键字呢，这里知识点就有点多了。
因为新建实例的代码：
instance &#x3D; new SingleInstance();
它不是一个原子操作，这个简单的赋值可以分为3步：
1、给SingleInstance分配内存
2、调用SingleInstance的构造方法
3、把instance指向分配的内存空间
这是正常逻辑的3个步骤，也只有按1 2 3执行后，这个instance才不是null。
但是Java内存模型允许这个进行指令重排序，也就是这3步可能是123也可能是132，所以这里就有问题了。
假如线程A和线程B，线程A已经跑到分析3处的代码，这时这条指令执行是132，刚把步骤3执行完，这时线程B跑到了分析1处的代码，会发现instance不为null了，这时线程B就直接返回了，从而导致错误。
既然知道了原因，那volatile关键字就是解决这个的，它可以禁止指令重新排序，而且保证所有线程看到这个变量是一致的，也就是不会从缓存中读取(这个特性后面有机会再说)，所以在创建instance实例时，它的步骤都是123，就不会出错了。
总结
其实一个小小的双重校验锁单例都还有蛮多知识点，后面我们来分析分析Kotlin中的单例都一般如何实现以及原理。</span>

今天，我将解释如何在 Flutter 创建一个后台任务。
在此之前，让我们理解什么是后台任务。后台任务是在后台运行的应用程序的辅助进程，即使应用程序没有运行或处于终止状态。
这一功能对于需要在后台执行任务而不需要用户打开应用程序的应用程序来说是有益的ーー例如，每 15 分钟调用 api 获取数据。
让我们在一个示例项目中实现一个后台任务，以便更好地理解这一操作的含义。
步骤:
pubspec.yaml
flutter pub add background_fetch
flutter pub get

在 main.dart 文件中导入后台包，并注册 HeadlessTask，以便在应用程序终止后接收 backgroundFetch 事件。
例如:
void backgroundFetchHeadlessTask(HeadlessTask task) async {var taskId &#x3D; task.taskId;
if(taskId &#x3D;&#x3D; ‘your_task_id’) {
print(‘your_task_id’);
print(‘[BackgroundFetch] Headless event received.’);
_//TODO: perform tasks like — call api, DB and local notification etc…
_}
}
void main() {
runApp(MyApp());
_//Registering backgroundFetch to receive events af…</span>

                    <span>我们对 DiffUtil 的使用可能被带偏了
前面都是我的流水账, 觉得看起来很没劲的, 可以直接跳转到本质小节,.
DiffUtil 的优势
我在最初接触 DiffUtil 时, 心中便对它有颇多的好感, 包括:
算法听提来就很nb, 一定是个好东西;
简化了 RecyclerView 的刷新逻辑, 无须关心该调用 notifyItemInserted 还是 notifyItemChanged, 一律submitList 就完事了(虽然 notifyDataSetChanged 也能做到, 但是性能拉胯, 而且没有动画);
LiveData 或者 Flow 监听单一 List 数据源时, 往往很难知道, 整个 List 中到底哪些数据项被更新了, 只能调用notifyDataSetChanged 方法, 而 DiffUtil 恰好就能解决这个问题, 无脑 submitList 就完事了.
DiffUtil 代码示例
使用 DiffUtil 时, 代码大致如下:
data class Item (
    var id: Long &#x3D; 0,
    var data: String &#x3D; &quot;&quot;
)

class DiffAdapter : RecyclerView.Adapter() {
    // AsyncListDiffer 类位于 androidx.recyclerview.widget 包下
    // 这里以 AsyncListDiffer 的使用来举例, 使用 ListAdapter 或者直接用 DiffUtil, 也存在后面的问题
    private val differ &#x3D; AsyncListDiffer(this, object : DiffUtil.ItemCallback() {
        override fun areItemsThe…</span>

                    <span>在本届CES2022，AMD带来新款桌面处理器、桌面显卡、移动处理器和移动显卡，其中的新款桌面显卡就是升级6nm制程工艺Radeon RX 6400 XT和Radeon RX 6500 XT ，而其中的Radeon RX 6500 XT在今天正式发售。
Radeon RX 6500 XT关键词：千元价位、6nm、RDNA 2

01/ 关于Radeon RX 6500 XT
AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT实际规格让人还是有些意外的，除了一些规格特殊之外，还有就是居然保留了【RDNA 2】大部分功能特性，甚至还最先采用了更为先进的6nm制程工艺，绝非新瓶旧酒的产品，这点来说挺不错的。
关于定价：目前Radeon RX 6500 XT官方指导价是1599元，如果关注装机市场朋友应该有感受，就是市面在1000-2000这个价格区间已经很久一段时间没有新品，上一代这价格区间的产品因为矿工需求等缘故，要么价格暴涨，要么直接没货，所以这次产品补全还挺重要，毕竟还是有不少用户显卡性能需求可能没那么高，只要求满足1080P FHD游戏体验即可。

【RDNA 2】特性全部保留
AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT基于Navi 24 GPU核心打造，依旧是RDNA 2架构，拥有16组CU计算单元，每一个CU计算单元里都包含一个【Ray Accelerator 光线加速器】，总共1024个流处理器，同时配备16MB无限缓存；显存部分配备了4GB的GDDR6显存，显存位宽为64位。
虽然核心\显存规格比其它RDNA 2架构高价卡低不少，但因为它也是最先采用6nm工艺制造，所以频率反倒是RDNA 2架构GPU里面最高的，且高出不少，基本就是靠飙高频来拼性能。

伴随RDNA 2架构，DX12U、DSAPI，DirectX光线追踪、可变速率着色、网格着色器、采样器反馈这些技术特性在…</span>

                    <span>「如期而至」APP上线一年左右，目前已经更新到 1.9.3 版本。去年重新设计和优化了很多地方，也如期完成了对 iPad 和 Siri 两个重要功能的支持，让记录和管理物品变得更加方便和快捷。
顺着这一年的版本更新记录，在此总结一下「如期而至」APP 的变化。
主题颜色修改
「如期而至」默认主题色是蓝色，一开始很多人说颜色太冲眼或太直男，希望有多个主题色可以选择，所以很快就推出了有 5 个颜色选择的版本。随着时间对色彩感受的弱化，我也意识到预设的几个颜色会满足不了用户的选择，于是后面又推出了自定义颜色，真正实现“赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，你的APP你做主”。

修改主题颜色之后，整个APP的主导色会跟着改变，包括小组件、消息通知框等。在使用自定义颜色的时侯，建议不要使用太淡的颜色，因为在诸如回顾视图日历、iPad 版环形图等地方会自动计算颜色深浅，太浅的颜色就会造成颜色异常。受制于 iOS 开发机制，APP图标没法动态同步自定义的颜色，所以目前只有 5 种颜色的图标可供选择。
丰富小组件样式
小组件如今有 5 款样式可供选择，“即将到期列表”可以按标签来进行显示。最早做的小组件设计不规范，在每个机型上显示都会不一样，后来改为按照公式自动计算间隙、宽高度，目前在各个设备上就比较正常了。

优化通知提醒
一开始做的提醒设定是每天都会进行提醒，比如选择了提醒范围 30 天，就会在物品剩余 30 天内每天都进行提醒，频繁的提醒容易让人烦燥和麻木。经过一番摸索后改成了递增的方式，越接近过期的物品提醒次数越多。
“提醒范围”每项对应的提醒时间点
增加开封功能
“开封”对于物品期限管理来说很重要，像是化妆品开瓶、咖啡豆开封等使用场景很有意义，所以也加入了开封的功能。按住物品向左滑动，显示开封设置界面。如果是当天拆封进行记录的，只需要填写新的期限保存即可；而如果是之前开封的，可以向右滑动开封界面，点…</span>

                    <span>很多问题不只有一种答案，比如这一个。
既可以就全新蒙迪欧设计和竞争力作答，也可以就全新蒙迪欧演变以及为何这般作答。两个答案都可以回答这个问题。只不过第一种回答是「鱼」，第二种回答是「渔」，需要读者自行判断，提炼答案。
我们尝试以第二种回答方式入手。
全新蒙迪欧并不是一款出人意料的车。
未真正亮相前，全新蒙迪欧大抵会有两种结果：一、由美国人（欧洲人）操刀继续做这款车真正意义上的迭代，在中美两国市场投放；二、按照EVOS的外观设计，衍生出轿车版的中级轿车，并命名为蒙迪欧。
关于全新蒙迪欧外观，实际上已经建立了两种预期，剩下的就是待全新蒙迪欧揭晓，告诉我们最终选择了哪一种。这就是为什么没有出人意料。
回过头去，美国人设计的蒙迪欧会是什么样子？
如果推测美国人设计的蒙迪欧，就必须先回到全新一代福克斯以及即将中期改款的福克斯上来。这是一款非常重要的车子。
2018年，全新一代福克斯在中国上市。作为福特全球车型，福克斯没有太多中国市场的元素。当时福特在中国的设计中心也没有成立，但随着福特中国战略的逐步推进，在福克斯这款车上，看到了越来越多的中国元素。
现在的福克斯拥有两套设计，一种为标准版，小开嘴、三角灯，大灯中间回形标；另一种是猎装版，大灯保持不变，但中网开始靠近EVOS以及蒙迪欧。


中控也是如此。新福克斯上市时采用了全球统一的内饰，但福特中国研发出了SYNC+车机系统之后，福特在华销售的车型都同步更换了这套车机，以至于个别车型出现了些审美上的问题。


按照历代福克斯和蒙迪欧之间设计上的关联，海外媒体的好事者曾经做出过下一代产品的假想图，只是这个假想图在今天看来，变成了Mustang Mach-E，但蒙迪欧也可以是这样。



那么，为什么会出现这种情况？
大的原因是——
中国市场和美国市场在消费需求上正在割裂，表现为通用、福特全力推动SUV品类的建设，逐步取消了轿车产品的研发…</span>

                    <span>写在开头
人物志系列停更许久，笔者本想先把陈朵人物志写完，但是思来想去，这个人物实在太火了，还是不凑那个热闹吧。
回望作品，笔者发现王也这个角色总能让人感触颇深，米二也愿意为他花费笔墨描绘他的人生轨迹，细腻之处甚至让笔者怀疑，王也就是米二理想中的自己。
他就像你我身边的一个朋友，在面上活得潇洒，混不吝，遇事有能量，有手段，年纪轻轻便走到了物质和精神两个层面的高峰。在骨子里他也温润如玉，豁达自在，哪怕怀璧其罪没有惶恐不安，哪怕力有未逮也始终放不下天下苍生， @天师道的白山正 说他和周圣合称”内圣外王“，这个”王“便是王也所行的王道。而在笔者看来，王也这个人物不仅仅是有其崇高的一面，他也有凡俗人的一面，相比“藏巧于贱”的张楚岚和“飞蛾扑火”的诸葛青，他向往逍遥世间的偷闲，也更是不愿沾染这世间的因果。
在笔者看来，王也其人，配得上”无为而无不为“一语。

生于安乐窝
王也作为中海集团老板王卫国的三公子，他的身家算得上出道即巅峰，投的一手好胎。
父亲的生意家大业大，父母还非常恩爱，生了三个儿子不够（王亦、王又、王也，瞧瞧这名字起的，啧啧啧），还想继续生闺女，甚至还有能助兴的蓝色小药丸，不得不说也总有一个幸福的原生家庭。

王卫国原型
此处有个小细节，王也的父亲叫做王卫国，出身行伍，上过边境，在部队里面也曾是吆五喝六的人物，其原型则是真实世界的两位牛人的混合体。
一位是王校长他爸，16岁就参军，17岁就到吉林省集安县的鸭绿江边成为了一名侦察兵，25岁就晋升排长进陆军学院进修，35岁则转业下海，62岁时登顶华人首富。这份经历和王卫国的人设不能说完全一致，只能说一毛一样。

另一位原型人物则是“玉帝专业户”，国家一级演员·真·王卫国。
先后在《西游记续集》、《宝莲灯》及《宝莲灯续集》中，饰演玉皇大帝一角，因此被广大观众熟知。有趣的是，正是因为王卫国扮演玉皇大帝的形象让人过目难忘，在以后的…</span>

                    <span>《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。
我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。
音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。


关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。

The basic purpose of a GraphQL API is the same as any other API: provide an interface where clients can get and change data. As most real-world APIs are used by
many types of users, defining who can access what is a central topic of every API design.
GraphQL is about graphs, so there are objects and connections between those objects and queries can define what part of the object graph they need. Access
control is similarly based on connections and about what objects a given user can reach. And this is defined by what objects the users can query directly
(“entry points”) and where they can go from there (“traversals”).
In this article we’ll look into the different ways to define access control in a GraphQL API and what are the common problems you’ll see.

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战
本篇文章翻译自官方的👉总览文章，这篇文章基本上把 Flutter 介绍清楚了，如果想从总体上知道 Flutter 是咋回事，本篇文章是最好的教程了。
以下是正文
本文旨在从高层级提供一个 Flutter 框架结构的总体概览，介绍一些其设计上的核心原则和概念。
Flutter 是一个跨平台的 UI 工具包，目的是一份代码可以运行在不同的操作系统上，比如 Android、IOS等等，同时也可以让应用直接和底层的平台服务交互。我们的目标是：尽量用一份代码，开发者就可以在不用的平台上开发出高性能、高保真的 APP。拥抱差异，更少代码，更高性能。
在开发阶段，Flutter 运行在虚拟机上，虚拟机提供了 hot reload 的功能，可以加载每次开发者改动的差异代码，而不需要全代码的编译。在正式版本上，Flutter 应用是直接编译成了机器码：Intel x64、ARM、JavaScript等等。这里说的开发阶段和正式版本是指 Flutter 产物的模式，Flutter 的产物有三种模式 debug、release、profile。Flutter 的 framework 是开源的，开源的协议是 BSD 协议，并且有活跃繁荣的第三方库社区，这些优秀的第三方库很好的补充了 Flutter 的能力。
本文的总览分为以下几个部分：
分层模型: Flutter 的组成部分
响应式 UI : Flutter UI 开发的核心概念
Widgets 介绍: Flutter UI 代码构建的基础
渲染流程: Flutter 是如何将 UI 代码转化为屏幕像素点的

需求背景
刚开始接到这个需求时，第一时间想到的是做成跟银行类app一样用户退到主页之后，需要在通知栏显示“XXX在后台运行”，并且该通知不能被清除，只有用户重新进入app再消失。然后就想到了一个方案前台服务(foregroundService) 来实现，于是撸起袖子就是干。
1、创建一个ForegroundService继承Service
2、重写onCreate等一系列方法
3、创建通知，根据不同版本来开启服务

根据不同版本开启服务
4、监听Application的生命周期，在onActivityStopped中显示前台服务，在onActivityResumed中取消前台服务


搞定，运行代码看看效果。。。
哦豁
完全不对，遇到的问题：
1、并不是所有onActivityStopped执行都是应用被切换至后台---此处百度“如何监听应用被切换至后台”
2、onActivityResumed的时候stopService如果操作快一下到后台一下到前台会收到一大堆的崩溃信息

崩溃信息
遇到问题那咱就解决问题呗，开干~~
1、这个问题倒是很好解决，百度上一大把，添加一个refCount变量，在onActivityStarted方法中++，在onActivityStopped方法中--，然后在onActivityStopped中判断当refCount等于0时表示应用退到后台


2、这个问题崩溃的信息意思就是调用了startForegroundService之后没有调用 Service.startForeground()方法，造成这个问题的原因就是短时间内重复进入退出应用，前台服务来不及start就已经被stop
那怎么办呢？
第一时间想到的是延迟几秒再stopService，写完运行结果还是一大堆崩溃0.0
于是：于是：发自内心的问自己，为什么要用前台服务？为什么要用前台服务？有没有其他方案呢？
答案肯定是有的，为什么一定要用前台服务呢？直接用通知不行么，好，就用通知
于是，就用一个通知管理类ForegroundPushManager来处理通知的显示和关闭


这样就完成了应用退到后台显示通知的功能了。

最后遇到的第二个问题如果有好的方案解决的话请大家踊跃指点，谢谢！！

                    <span>在 Google I/O 2019，我们分享了 Room 2.2 的最新进展。尽管当时已经支持了很多功能，如 支持 Flow API，支持预填充数据库，支持一对一及多对多数据库关系，但是开发者们对 Room 有着更高的期望，我们也致力于此，在 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 版本中发布了很多开发者们期待的新功能！包括自动化迁移，关系查询方法以及支持 Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) 等等。下面我们就来逐一介绍这些新功能！
如果您更喜欢通过视频了解此内容，请 点击此处 查看。
自动化迁移
在谈自动化迁移之前，先看看什么是数据库迁移。假如您更改了数据库 schema，就需要根据数据库版本进行迁移，以防用户设备内置数据库中现有数据丢失。
如果您使用 Room，那么在 数据库迁移 过程中会进行检查并验证更新后的 schema，另外您也可以在 @Database 中设置 exportSchema，来导出 schema 信息。
对于 Room 2.4.0 版本之前的数据库迁移，您需要实现 Migration 类，并在其中编写大量复杂冗长的 SQL 语句，来处理不同版本之间的迁移。这种手动迁移的形式，非常容易引发各种错误。
现在 Room 支持了自动迁移，让我们通过两个示例来对比手动迁移和自动迁移:
修改表名
假设有一个包含两个表的数据库，表名分别是 Artist 和 Track，现在想要将表名 Track 改为 Song。

如果使用手动迁移，必须编写和执行 SQL 语句才能更改，需要如下操作:
val MIGRATION_1_2: Migration &#x3D; Migration(1, 2) {
    fun migrate(database: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {
        database.execSQL(&quot;ALTER TAB…</span>

前言
春节临近，在深圳干活的打工人们却在为疫情烦恼，最近出了不少病例，希望赶紧平息，能开开心心回家吧~
这几天翻了翻好久都没有维护过了的hexo博客 苍耳的博客，自从换工作后就没有时间摸鱼和学习了，博客也自然而然就停滞了下来，一到双休日只想着睡觉。。。好了，言归正传，翻到了19年刚毕业的时候做的一个跟 Termux 相关的需求，疫情严重，返乡难定，跟大家分享一个挺可爱的嘟嘟火车吧~在 Android 设备上遛一遛。
没啥技术难度，纯粹图一乐~
Termux
这是 Android 设备上的一款终端扩展软件，可以用来扩展 Android 设备上被阉割的 shell 功能，开源且不需要 root(工作空间就在app的私有目录下)，它支持 apt 管理软件包，并拥有自己的 apt 仓库源，这点就很舒服了，Termux 会维护他们的软件仓库源，仓库里有很多常用的软件包，比如说 curl, python 等等，因此可以实现支持 Python, PHP, Go, Nodejs, MySQL 等的功能环境。
简单使用
Termux 的GitHub仓库地址，可以在这里面查看安装方式。安装成功后第一次打开它会下载解压 bootstrap 包，主要用来在应用的私有目录下设置一个类 Linux 的文件结构，并设置环境变量等等。初始化完成后在 termux app 的私有目录下会解压出以下文件结构：
初始化完成后可以看到它就是一个 Linux Terminal 一样的界面，可以在里面跑 shell 命令了。然后还可以通过 apt 来安装管理软件，记得先 apt update 更新一下哈~

📢前言

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第62天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：同构字符串
给定两个字符串 s 和 t，判断它们是否是同构的。
如果 s 中的字符可以按某种映射关系替换得到 t ，那么这两个字符串是同构的。
每个出现的字符都应当映射到另一个字符，同时不改变字符的顺序。不同字符不能映射到同一个字符上，相同字符只能映射到同一个字符上，字符可以映射到自己本身。
示例1:
输入：s &#x3D; &quot;egg&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;add&quot;
输出：true

示例2:
输入：s &#x3D; &quot;foo&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;bar&quot;
输出：false

示例3:
输入：s &#x3D; &quot;paper&quot;, t &#x3D; &quot;title&quot;
输出：true

提示：
可以假设 s 和 t 长度相同。
🌻C#方法：一次遍历
对比下标数组是否一致，用于检测两字符串同构。
代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t)
    {
        List indexS &#x3D; new List();
        List indexT &#x3D; new List();

        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：72 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了82.28%的用户
内存消耗：39 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了7.60%的用户

🌻Java 方法：哈希
思路解析
需要我们判断 s 和 t 每个位置上的字符是否都一一对应，即 s 的任意一个字符被 t 中唯一的字符对应，同时 t 的任意一个字符被 s 中唯一的字符对应。这也被称为「双射」的关系。
以示例 2 为例，t 中的字符 a 和 r 虽然有唯一的映射 o，但对于 s 中的字符 o 来说其存在两个映射 {a,r}，故不满足条件。
因此，我们维护两张哈希表，第一张哈希表 s2t 以 s 中字符为键，映射至 t 的字符为值，第二张哈希表t2s 以 t 中字符为键，映射至 s 的字符为值。从左至右遍历两个字符串的字符，不断更新两张哈希表，如果出现冲突（即当前下标 index 对应的字符 s[index] 已经存在映射且不为t[index] 或当前下标 index 对应的字符 t[index] 已经存在映射且不为 s[index]）时说明两个字符串无法构成同构，返回false。
如果遍历结束没有出现冲突，则表明两个字符串是同构的，返回true 即可。
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        Map s2t &#x3D; new HashMap();
        Map t2s &#x3D; new HashMap();
        int len &#x3D; s.length();
        for (int i &#x3D; 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：24 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了25.02%的用户
内存消耗：38.4 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了48.09%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( n )
空间复杂度：O( ∣Σ∣ ) ，其中 Σ 是字符串的字符集。哈希表存储字符的空间取决于字符串的字符集大小，最坏情况下每个字符均不相同，需要O(∣Σ∣) 的空间。

                    <span>背景
熟悉Android的同学对Handler、Looper、MessageQueue、Message应该是非常熟悉了，Android是一个基于消息驱动的系统，我们在日常开发中用到消息队里的地方非常多。Android也给我们封装好了一个强大易用的消息处理API，但是我们怎么在C++层实现这一功能了。
不需要多复杂的IPC机制，我们只需要实现一个简易的消息队列机制就行了。Android的消息队列机制实现太过复杂了，其实在音视频中很多东西不需要这么复杂，我们只需要将我们需要的那部分抠出来就可以了。
Android消息队列
Android中消息分发相关的类有：
HandlerThread
Looper
Handler
MessageQueue
Message
正常构建一个消息分发机制的代码如下：
HandlerThread thread &#x3D; new HandlerThread(&quot;Message Thread&quot;);
thread.start();
Handler handler &#x3D; new Handler(thread.getLooper());
//......
handler.sendMessage(....)

大体的流程如下：
通过创建HandlerThread实例，HandlerThread实例中构建一个Looper实例
通过调用HandlerThread实例的start()方法开始执行消息队列轮转，进入Looper中的轮转
Handler实例中持有刚刚创建的Looper实例
Looper实例中构建一个消息队列MessageQueue
Handler每次发送消息都会通过Handler持有的Looper实例添加到消息队列中
Looper轮转中会消化处理消息
简单的流程示意如下图：


可以看到Looper.java中的轮转函数中有无限循环在执行，这个无限循环中会不断地消费消…</span>

前言
随着春节长假的临近，公司项目也逐渐进入封网阶段，总之千言万语最后都汇成一句话：

接下来应该有不少时间瞎搞了，但愿～
回正题，这次要说的内容正如标题所述，京东首页的吸顶效果；
在Android原生上，这貌似是一个有些麻烦的问题：
正如这篇文章所述，最主要的问题是嵌套的滑动事件无法实现两者互通：
仿京东、淘宝首页，通过两层嵌套的RecyclerView实现tab的吸顶效果
在Android中，手势在不同View之间的传递，如果不像ViewPager那样自己处理的话，就是基于
ViewParentCompat以及NestedScrollChild和NestedScrollParent那套，说白了就是一层一层的View分发传递；由此带来的问题就是，如果在两层嵌套滑动的View之间插入了一层View，这个View不支持嵌套滑动摆烂的话，就没人接着分发事件，自然无法实现嵌套滑动；
当然这只是其中一种解决方案，如果用 CoordinatorLayout 也同样可以实现这个效果；不过仍然要自定义来解决获知child中哪个是要嵌套滑动的View的问题；例如这个：
PersistentCoordinatorLayout
总之没法一步到位；
而在Flutter上，就没有上面这个问题：
如果用Flutter来做，非常简单，NestedScrollView本身就有这种隔着祖宗十八代也能找到亲戚关系的能力，并且也基于此实现了事件分发传递：换句话说，完全不需要自己处理，NestedScrollView本身就可以实现；
那么带着问题来看一下Flutter 的 NestedScrollView 是如何实现的：

概念
Drawable表示一种可以在Canvas上进行绘制的抽象的概念，它有很多种，常见的如颜色和图片都可以是一个Drawable。
优点
首先，它的使用比较简单，在xml里已经定义了大量的属性方法，我们只要熟悉各个属性的ui效果和特点就可以自己组合各种的界面效果。
其次，它的实现成本比自定义View低，一些比较简单的、定制性、重复性的UI效果使用drawable将会缩小开发成本。但是一些比较复杂的ui场景，drawable却表现不出自定义view的那种效果。
相比较于图片而言，drawable占用空间更小，这样有利于缩小apk的体积。
表现形式
Drawable尽管对于应用程序通常不可见，但Drawable可以采用多种形式：
Bitmap:最简单的Drawable，一个PNG或JPEG图像。
Nine Patch:是对PNG格式的扩展允许它指定如何对其进行拉伸和放置的信息
Vector:向量：在XML文件中定义的可绘制的一组点，线和曲线以及相关的颜色信息。 这种类型的绘图可以缩放而不会损失显示质量。
Shape:形状：包含简单的绘图命令而不是原始位图，允许在某些情况下调整更好。
Layers:图层：一个可绘制的复合物，它在彼此顶部绘制多个底层可绘图。
States:状态，一个复合drawable，根据其状态选择一组drawable中的一个。
Levels：级别：一个复合drawable，根据其级别从一组drawable中选择一个。
Scale:比例尺：一个可绘制的单个子组合可绘制的组合，其整体大小根据当前级别进行修改。
直接子类与非直接子类

                    <span>Dislike 是一个日常生活事务管理工具。
之所以说这款 App 另类，一则 Dislike 专门设计来打理生活琐事，而非像多数同类产品一样着眼于效率提升；二则 Dislike 没有遵循任何既定的时间管理理论，完全依照普通人的日常使用「直觉」设计、开发。
这意味着使用 Dislike，你不需要为了记录、提醒一些事情去强迫自己学习任何理论，或是改变一种生活方式。
关于时间管理的完整思考，我在《我们究竟需要怎样的时间管理工具》这篇文章里有较详细的记录，感兴趣的朋友可以翻阅。
如果市面上鼎鼎大名的 GTD 类 App 你用了个遍都无法坚持，说明你很可能和我一样不是个「效率达人」，那么我非常推荐你试试 Dislike。
Dislike 基础功能介绍参见这篇文章：
 
Dislike 3.0 做了 10 余项较大的功能新增及优化，以及一堆没仔细数过的细节提升。
虽然做了很多工作，但 UI 层面仍然保持了精简、克制，这也是从 Dislike 着手设计 1.0 至今一直贯彻的理念。
拣几个 3.0 的重点功能说说。
事件创建重构

Dislike 3.0 完全重新设计、开发了事件创建功能。
这也是 3.0 版本最耗费精力的一块开发工作。
2.x 版本的事件创建逻辑本身没问题，同类日程 App 大多采用的也是类似的创建逻辑（包括 iOS 系统日历）。优点是创建流程清晰易懂，缺点是步骤稍显繁琐。
尤其对于复杂事件，常常需要多次往返于二级、甚至三级设置页面。
相较同类 App，Dislike 事件的日期、重复、提醒等设置更为灵活，这进一步加剧了 Dislike 2.x 版本创建事件的交互复杂度。
不破不立，3.0 版本推翻重构后的事件创建模块 ，所有设置项均可在 1 个页面内完成。
定制化的日期和时间控件，左右滑动可快速定位日期选择，双击返回今天。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

前言
收到我人生最大的一笔单篇稿费的这天晚上，我失眠了。
当然不是因为钱多烧的，而是白天咖啡喝多了 2021 年最后一篇稿子赚来的稿酬成功让我回想起了成为少数派作者的这一年。
我是 Leslie，一个致力于让没有医学背景的人听懂医生在说啥的科普作者，一年以前，我还只是一个潜水的小透明，现在却混进了少数派的作者群。不过和作者群里两百多个大佬不一样，我不太厉害。在「高效工作」领域，我是个吊车尾，不会编程，不会拆电脑修手机，不会摄影，不会录播客，不会剪视频；在「品质生活」方面，我不会马伽术，不会做厉害的咖啡或是诱人的饭菜，不会种菜，不会俄语，没有惊人的读书量和阅片量，去过的地方也很少。在以上知识技能和经历方面相信很多读者都可以来无情地碾压我。而且我还是个内向的「社恐」。
但你既然已经读到了这篇文章，说明我对这个社区还是有一点点价值的。一直以来我写的多是具体的医学健康话题，这次，我想讲点柔软的，讲讲在成为了少数派作者的这一年，我这样的普通人在坚持写作之后，在网络上终于开始 reach out 之后，有了什么样的改变和思考。希望可以鼓励到和我有着类似渴望或相同困境的读者。
在关系中成长——和编辑的故事
正如《也许你该找个人聊聊》的作者所说，人和人是在关系中成长的。
我向来习惯在现实生活和社交网络中对陌生人保持缄默，而在少数派上写稿、加入作者群，让我产生了新的和人的联结，我认识了好多编辑，有的勇敢，有的善良，有的很宽容，有的很硬汉。在这样的交流中我除了交了十几篇稿…</span>

                    <span>三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。

WTCR是什么
讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。

拿到WTCR冠军有多难？
既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。

摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。

有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。

这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.

在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。

拿到这个冠军有什么意义？
一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。

在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。

中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。

对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。

对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。

而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。

                    <span>看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧
先上个答案：会也不会
我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是16岁拿的驾照17岁买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车，没有国内驾驶经验但是北美交规和限速也差不多。总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的，在两个方面都有足够的经验可以说明问题。
我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。
赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。
公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。
加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…
至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…
总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…

                    <span>一、区位优势
青岛作为2020年北方又一个GDP破万亿的城市，除了旅游产业创造的价值，本身具备工业产业链，信息产业链的基础，海尔、海信等企业创造了一定基数的软件人才基数，一汽青岛，烟台现代等储备了一定当量的制造人才。
自然环境优越宜居，有一定当量的人才基础，房价还不高，很多一线城市被卷怕了的互联网，汽车人才是有可能去安家落户的。


二、北方经济增长点
目前郑州从发展的态势来说，由于交通的区位枢纽优势，整体的工业布局潜力要强于青岛，从GDP增速也可以看到。
尽管青岛作为全国 GDP 排名前十五的城市，后劲在哪里？从产业机构上来说，海尔海信并没有在青岛孵化更多的信息产业。而旅游业对自然环境的要求既是吸引人才的要素也是抑制大规模工业投资的，这可能会成为产业结构质量提升的掣肘。
青岛GDP发展的后劲就在利用人才优势绑定支柱产业创造新基建的产业价值，所以青岛需要高合，需要一个可能性来吸引更多的可能性。


三、高合需要青岛
目前的新势力的模式实际上已经逐渐成型了。
step 1.用国际一线资本实现从0到1的融资，也是背书。这是资源能力的体现。
step2.  合理合规的与地方国有资本促进产业升级的愿望契合并合作，实现区域的自然资源、社会资源、社会资本的整合（如合肥国资委对蔚来的投资，蔚来梦想工厂的落户。）
step3. 好好干，车卖得好了资本市场首先就会有反应，其次是地方的GDP对上下游产业链的拉动效应和人才的虹吸效应（exp:小米作为北京国资委2022年重点项目）
其实不止是汽车产业政府这么做，只是汽车产业动静比较大，对上下游的拉动能力比较强。


四、为什么是中国总部？
其实，还有世界总部、中国总部，软件中心、设计中心、营销中心都可以落户不同的地方，
获取不同区域的融资。这会是新势力融资的一种趋势，落户+产业合作与引进。
只要题材做的对，做的到位，产业链的拉动能够促进地方经济的体量和质量的发展，政府就愿意签约。
作为刚刚做过政府融资的HR。
政府引进产业、签署招商协议，绝对是有要求，有长远眼光，会有非常细致的GDP+税收的拉动要求的，而且这个钱不好拿。
但只要企业能够提供政府想要的价值，并且能够说到做到。分阶段的支持就会到来。


个人看法，青岛只是开始，今后，产业链相对完整、人才相对充裕的准一线，新一线城市会有更多的新势力落户，这符合国家的期待，也符合新基建的发展规律。

                    <span>去年这个时候我写了一篇关于日本威士忌的文章，算是入门科普帖（没看过的可以先戳进去预习一下）。
发布后反响有点出乎意料地好，看来当时对日威有兴趣的人就已经不少，生活也确实需要偶尔喝点小酒放松一下。
所以今天继续来聊聊日威，能为自己喜欢的东西写上一篇攻略性的文章，是一件快乐的事儿。



这一年里日威的热度依旧蹭蹭上涨，现在国内的酒吧或是酒店行政酒廊里没放几瓶日威都撑不起场面，唱衰日威的人又被打脸了。



口说无凭，来看2021年WWA（人称威士忌奥斯卡）的评选结果。日本秩父酒厂的调和威士忌又又又拿奖了，这是它的第四次蝉联。



不过决定写日威第二弹其实还有个契机在。南泊山的老板和菜菜是好朋友，所以我们编辑也会时不时去店里写（摸）稿（鱼），顺便喝咖啡。



前几天正好遇到店里在做特调新品咖啡，场面过于精彩，差点以为自己在看调酒。一问用的是日威，我心里直呼：老板真舍得下本啊！偷偷往柜台看了一眼，用的是知多。
老板说1.0版本用的是苏威，但后来还是决定用日威，毕竟它自带“流量”。



厚脸皮蹭了一杯，入口有一种陌生又熟悉的感觉。酒体强烈的风味并没有盖住咖啡的香气和奶香味，反而让奶咖的味道变得有棱角。一口一口地品，还没过瘾，杯子就见底了。



另外还有两款特调，名字也有意思。
「人间清醒」，高浓度埃塞俄比亚花魁soe，搭配上经过与黄糖融合灼烧过的松井，非常硬核。
「梅空见你」，若鹤梅酒搭配青梅露，加冰雪克，香槟杯做盐边，加入苏打水，最后淋上低浓度的冰的水洗埃塞俄比亚耶加雪菲手冲。
如果你在杭州，可以改天带爱喝酒的朋友一起去品品。日威做特调，是真的下血本。





傍晚走出咖啡店的时候，不得不再次感慨日威确实一年比一年出息。虽然今年在WWA上拿的世界性奖项远不如往年多，但在讨论热度上日威明显已经压了苏威一头。



照这趋势，起步晚于苏格兰、美国、爱尔兰和加拿大的世界第五大…</span>

                    <span>写成都怎么住，我是有发言权的。因为我可以很负责任的说，今天提到的酒店，我去过85%以上。
住的多，自然推荐起来也会更加的有理有据一些。



关于成都怎么住？我是这么看的...
1）如果你是去成都旅行的，也之前是没怎么去过成都的，我会建议你住在成都1环内。
成都绝大部分的景点，都在一环内（或一环边上）。所以如果你住在一环内的话，去哪里旅行可都是很方便的。
绝对绝对不要超过成都的二环。



但如果你是多刷成都，多住住一环外也是不错的。
例如想去熊猫基地的，附近有皇冠假日；想去泡温泉的，金堂有美憬阁；想去青城山的，六善和SLH的青城山尊都不错；都江堰则是有宋品别墅。



2）住新不住旧，一家酒店的最佳入住时间是开业半年到开业六年内。
举个例子，我之前去成都喜欢住君悦，主要是位置好、吃的好、性价比也高，还能让我刷凯悦的SNP。
后来有一次去成都，偶尔住了瑯珀·凯悦臻选后，我发现瑯珀明显更香啊。真不是君悦不好，是瑯珀更好。



3）按照档次来推荐（仅成都市区）
第一档：博舍、钓鱼台
第一点五档：海湾大酒店、尧棠公馆、瑯珀·凯悦臻选
第二档：君悦、希尔顿嘉悦里、华尔道夫、W、丽思、瑞吉、环球中心天堂洲际、费尔蒙、万达瑞华、协信中心希尔顿、成都希尔顿
第三档：其它五星酒店
国宾馆：成都金牛宾馆
老字号：四川锦江宾馆
如果是成都的外围，青城山六善、青城山尊（凯悦悠选旗下），都江堰的宋品别墅（有温泉），官塘安麓、金堂美憬阁（有温泉）、黑龙滩的洲际和英迪格都是不错的。



说完方法论，接下来是推荐：
1）根据周边景点来推荐
成都酒店有一点特别好。就是每个景点边上，总会有一家值得住的酒店。所以在订酒店的时候，你就看你想去哪里浪，然后就订边上的酒店。



宽窄巷子，钓鱼台
在成都，有两家酒店的位置极好。一家是宽窄巷子里的钓鱼台，另外一家是太古里的博舍。都是闹中取静的好去处。

我心想：我最近也没提过代码，应该不是我的问题吧。（甩锅~.~）
把电脑插上手机后，我看到下面这段报错一直在loop
