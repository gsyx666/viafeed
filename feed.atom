The base of the web development is HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
Try to practice these things as much as you can at the core levels Because the advance topics are related or combination of core topics and can only be understood if you are familiar with the basics. 
For the HTML part - try to practice the important tags as much as you can like p , h1-h6 , ol  and ul , div, etc and also semantic tags like main ,…]]></summary>

...I don't think anyone says "happy new week" but whatever.
Today, I planned out my Weekly Sprint Goals. I intend to finish the Services pages for my company website, then deploy them after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them. I also intend to continue learning Next.js, Scrum, and SWR. Lastly, I would like to learn new technologies, and I'm thinking of MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter, but I will most likely do it if I have the extra time.
Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!
Just like I do every weekend, I did my 11th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.
I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on learning Next.js, Scrum, and SWR, updating my website, and maybe picking up another technology when I have the extra time.
finish building the Services pages for my company website

deploy the updates after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them.
continue learning by reading the Next.js documentation.
continue going through Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
learn SWR and go through the documentation.
continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.
If I have the extra time, I'm going to learn either MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter.
Thank you for reading! Have a good day!

NepTunes：Mac 上的音乐播放小工具

平台：macOS
关键词：音乐

此前我一直是 Spotify 的忠实拥趸，充足的曲库以及成熟的音乐算法，完全击中我的痛点。但音乐流媒体可是个竞争极其激烈的领域，QQ 音乐有霸主地位的华语曲库优势，Apple Music 在去年连续推出了无损音乐和空间音频资源，Tidal 在保持音质优势的同时也不断扩充曲库，相比之下 Spotify 似乎是不进则退退退退。

可几年的使用习惯摆在那里，放弃 Spotify 不太容易，但 Apple Music 囤了大半年的免费体验不用又很可惜，成年人嘛，做什么选择，当然是两个都启用啦。不过双持的问题也很明显，二者有着不同的应用布局，曲库标记也完全独立，很难做到「二位一体」。如果你恰好在使用二者的音乐服务，又是 macOS 用户，那今天推荐的 NepTunes 或许可以帮你减少一些麻烦。
NepTunes 是一款音乐小组件，但与 macOS 原生小组件不同，它可以放置在桌面上任意位置，支持全程置顶/底…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[教计算机学科的教师需要懂计算机吗？

国外一位负责计算机学科的教师认证的负责人说，“计算机学科的教师确实需要 了解计算机。”而现在开箱即用的脚本化内容和短期培训培养出来的计算机教师并不了解他们的学科、他们的学生以及如何进行教学。很多教师在短期集中培训计算机学科后就可以教它。这种方法可能会让这些学生通过标准化考试，但从长远来看，这并没有给学生带来他们需要的东西，也没有给他们应得的东西。


老王点评：这真是形式化的学习和考试。不知道国内的计算机教育情况如何。




Faker.js 自毁后，开源社区复刻接管了它

Faker 是一个生成虚假但合理数据的库，可用于测试和开发，最早由 Perl 语言开发，之后移植到包括 JavaScript 在内的各种语言。在 Facker.js 项目被原开发者 自毁 之后，对大量依赖该库的程序造成了破坏，因此，社区在原项目上 复刻，重新建立了围绕它的 社区，由八位社区成员接管维护。开发者在复刻后，进行了 大量的工作，包括处理了许多拉取请求和议题，并提出一系列富有建设性的路线图。此外，用户多次强烈要求将原作者从赞助名单中移除，因此，社区决定将 Open Collective 原来收到的一万多美元的赞助留给两位原作者，而新的赞助将归属新的社区团队。


老王点评：以开源方式做出贡献不是泄愤的理由，还好开源给了更多可能。




服务数百万域名的邮件服务商出现问题后

Mail2World 是一个服务了 215 万个域名的邮件服务商，已经运营了几十年。最近他们似乎遭受到勒索软件攻击，因而许多依赖于他们的邮箱服务的用户陷入了 麻烦。而服务商还“正在努力尽快全面恢复电子邮件服务”中。一位用户反馈称，“它与我所有的账户联系在一起，不仅包括社交媒体和物联网设备，还包括银行业务、获得医疗服务以及与当地和全国政府当局的联系。”


老王点评：当越来越集中的基础服务没有提供相应的更高可靠性时，其带来的影响是灾难性的。]]></summary>

今天还没收到订单确认邮件，网站也没有状态可以查。搜了下，YouTube 有些关于这个网站的诈骗视频下面评论也有人说是诈骗，想想还是找 PayPal 申诉退钱。结果发现申诉界面显示是一个北京的食品公司认证的，感觉肯定是诈骗了，或者至少超出经营范围？然后搜了下，说 12315 可以举报，拿起支付宝就打开小程序举报了。
但没有什么证据。。只能附上 PayPal 账号，不知道能不能让国内 PayPal 配合调查，或者会不会被查。。钱已经从信用卡公司要回来了，但是真是觉得背后可能有啥黑产之类的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近，支付宝和微信纷纷祭出了「大动作」：前有支付宝的一键标记已读，后有微信的「史诗级」新功能从暂停处继续播放语音——看起来好像是「人性化」的细节更新。作为每天都在使用支付宝和微信的用户，我们真正需要的功能，仅仅只是那么简单吗？
除了语音播放，微信的问题还不少
相信不少人都有在微信收获「60s 语音炸弹」的头疼时刻。在我看来，微信语音消息目前的问题主要是以下几点：

用户无法控制语音消息的播放进度，如果语音消息的播放中断，我们不得不从头来过（在微信 8.0.17 中得到部分解决）；
用户无法在语音录制时查看屏幕上的其他内容，只能看到倒计时读秒，大块的屏幕空间被浪费；
语音消息无法转发，或以最近消息的形式同步到登录的其他设备上。

我之所以反感语音消息，主要是因为用户不能自由控制语音播放。如果中断了语音消息的播放，就不得不从头来过。但是，微信本次更新仅提供了一个「继续播放」的按钮，并没有真正解决痛点。在语音消息的播放中，常常有些听不清楚，或者是难以一次理解的片段出现，「继续播放」的功能并没有解决这一需求。

这也正是为什么，许多用户希望微信能够加上语音控制条来调节播放进度——最好还能加上播放速度、音量的整体设置。只有这样，上文提到的第一个问题才能得以解决。
相比之下，iMessage 的语音消息功能，就比微信更加实用。
首先，语音录制的过程中，我们无需一直按住屏幕，只要按住并向左滑动按钮，就可以查看 iMessage 对话中的其他消息，方便我们对某些消息进行回应。其次，由于语音本质上是通过音频文件来发送的，因此除了简单的「暂停」功能外，iMessage 还有具体的进度条，方便用户调节播放的起始位置。

最后，语音消息可以转发，也可以通过 iCloud 在设备间无缝同步。以上三点正好对应了之前所提到的微信语音的几个问题，在我看来是比较完善的语音消息的解决方案之一。
当然了，微信的…]]></summary>

如题，一个 C#的 dll 项目（之前是.net framework 4.8 ）中，通过 fody 打包引用的库。VS 为 2022 版，Fody 为 nuget 上的最新版。
False，编译时就不会复制此文件，最后 Fody 生成的 dll 文件中也不会包含此引用的打包文件  

    ..\Lib\Example.exe
    False


在将项目更改为.net standard 2.0 后（经测试，2.1 ，以及.net 5.0\6.0 均有同样问题），引用的右下角属性内的“复制本地”选项变为了影响 CopyLocal 项，例如我此时将这个文件改为“复制本地”，那么 csproj 中将会变成这样

    ..\Lib\Example.exe
    False
    True


问题来了，这样的配置下，在生成时并不会复制 Example.exe ，fody 也不会打包此文件。
为 True ，那么编译时将会正常复制并打包。  
简单来说就是，VS 在编译时候似乎完全无视了，而只认。
查看微软的官方文档，VS2022 的 MSBuild 说明中只有 Private 元数据而没有 CopyLocal 。根据说明，Private 属性指示“指定是否应将引用复制到输出文件夹。 此特性与 Visual Studio IDE 中的引用的“复制本地”属性相匹配。”

，根据生成时的表现来看，确实也只有设置的值有实际效果。
但是即使直接新建空白项目，引用文件并设置“复制本地”后，VS 修改的也只有 csproj 中的项而不是项。
的值。只能手动编辑 csproj 文件。
所以我现在非常迷糊，到底这个和是什么关系呢？我之前以为是升级换代的关系，但是即使我删掉了旧项目中的只保留，在编译项目时，文件复制依然会按照 Private 的默认值(true)执行文件复制与 Fody 打包，而完全无视了的值。彻底把我给整不会了

        <updated>2022-01-17T08:08:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：
1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。
”盐者，百肴之将“[1]，意思就是盐为"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。
同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。

比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。
比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。
比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。


另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。
2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性
人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。
可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。
糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。
3. 盐的可获得性高于糖
盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。
大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。
而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。

综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。

某天和朋友聚餐，途中谈到在 git 提交信息使用 emoji 的话题，引起了大家浓厚兴趣。
在我接触的项目中，git 提交规则大多按约定执行，这些约定往往写在了开发手册中（大多数和版本升级规则一并约定），但几乎没有对 emoji 的使用进行约定。
于是，回家后开始研究，原来 github 上还真有一个项目，提倡在 git 提交中使用 emoji 。
这样带来的好处是:
1. 非常清晰明表达本次提交的主要内容；
2. 在众多的提交列表中，特征比较明显，容易查找历史某次提交信息；
3. 较为美观

目前比较主流的使用方式为:
git commit -m ':emoji_code: any commit messages(iusse)'

If you've ever been on a support call, you've probably spent several minutes spelling out even the shortest commands and explaining in detail where the spaces and returns fall. While it's often easier to just seize control of a user's computer, that's not really the best way to educate. What you might try instead is sending a user a screen recording, but one that they can copy commands from and paste into their own terminal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

自从上大学离开家乡之后，这么多年来也算是兜兜转转路过了、生活了好多城市。我的一个非常普遍的观察就是，北方城市相对于南方城市会更加有一种棱角感、粗旷感，路会宽些，建筑会方正些，线条会简洁些。后来去了欧洲，这样的感受无疑被愈发的放大了，就拿德国东北部的城市来说，就和南德诸城有着「判若两国」的区别，只是走在街道上就能强烈的感受得到。
北京，作为一个北方的超级城市，给我的观感更是如此。路很宽，宽到可能要小跑着才能赶在绿灯变红前通过一个十字路口；建筑很粗旷，别提小阳台了，甚至连飘窗都恨不能凹进整栋建筑里以维持整栋建筑的方正。这么看来，北京的城市画像像极了一个「国字脸大叔」，平时不苟言笑，永远板正，永远严肃。
可是即便在这样的一座大城里，也有一些小街小巷的浪漫，那就是被钢铁丛林包围着的北京的老城。老城里，有着外乡人一般很难触及的一些市井生活，比如胡同生活；也有老北京也鲜少触及（或不屑触及）的生活，比如常年游人如织的故宫等皇城遗址。
作为一个在北京生活的外乡人（至少我自己这么认为），在北京生活了近四年的时间，唯一不会拒绝的一个邀约，就是去逛胡同，逛春夏秋冬的胡同。
北京胡同一景
如果你对城市的历史感兴趣的话
胡同让我着迷的一个原因就是他的名字流传下来都是有一定的历史原因的，这能够让你置身在其中的时候能够感受历史长河的流动。
禄米仓胡同
禄米仓胡同位于北京东城区的东南部，顾名思义，是明清两朝存储官俸米的地方。如果现在去这条胡同的话，你会发现已经被军需装备研究所占用了。这虽然是当下的状态，…]]></summary>

徒步雨崩，感受虔诚的力量


徒步难度：★★★★
风景指数：★★★★★
最佳季节：4-6月/9-11月




梅里雪山的主峰卡瓦格博海拔6740米，是云南的最高点，也是最被尊崇的藏传佛教神山之一，又被藏人称作“太子雪山”，至今梅里雪山所有重要山峰均没有登顶成功的记录。



人人都以能看一眼梅里巍峨的雄姿为荣，而只有日出时云雾消散，才能看到毫无遮挡的“日照金山”，这难以得见的奇景是许多人数次前来的理由。想要亲近雪山，可以徒步 进入雨崩…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每逢年末，各方媒体与出版商都会公布年度书单，向公众推荐他们评选出来的各种好书。对于每一个喜欢阅读的人来讲，这个书单是不可错过的。对于普通人来讲，这些书单也是一年的风向标，可以一窥大众阅读走向，最末可以充当茶余饭后的谈资。
在阅读各家书单的时候，你会发现这样一个事情：英雄往往所见略同，一些优秀的书籍就会出现在多家的年度书单当中。当然这也不是说其他的图书不够好，有些稍显小众题材的图书也同样值得我们关注。
遍览各家书单的时候，我更喜欢的是历史向的图书。在我看来，这些历史类的书相对于虚构的文学作品来讲，他们更多了一份真实、一份厚重。
2021 年是辛亥革命 110 周年。「筚路蓝缕，以启山林。」无数先贤用努力奋斗换来我们今日的成就。在这个时候，回顾一下与我们自身相关的图书无疑有着特别的意义。所以我在这些推荐的书单当中选择了与我们脚下这片土地相关的历史书籍。通过它们来了解这片土地曾经发生过的事情，那些对今天依然产生重大影响力的事件。
书单的整体情况
与往年相比，2021 年看起来似乎并没有太大的不同。但 2021 年也有其自身的印记。对于「中国史」学界来讲，2021 年我们痛失了两位史学大家，一位是我国著名的史学家与教育家章开沅先生，另一位是美国著名的汉学家史景迁。 二者相关著述可以通过豆瓣上的链接 章开沅、史景迁 了解更多。「大家」的去世无疑给相关的研究带来了不可估量的损失。
章开沅(照片来自 新华网湖北频道 )与史景迁(照片来自 美国国家人文学术基金会)
而对于书单本身来讲，2021 年同样有一个值得悲伤的事情，那就是中国亚马逊（以下简称中亚）没有如期发布年度书单。作为以往普通读者比较关注的书单之一，中亚的书单一度是读者买书的风向标。随着中亚业务方向的调整，中亚已经在事实上退出了纸质图书的经销并收缩为一个海外购的服务商。而最近的关于 Kindle 退出的消息不绝于耳，这也不禁让人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些天来，各种各样的人都在创建视频内容。从专业的 YouTubers 到学校教师，创建视频内容已经成为各种工作内容的一部分。

从屏幕记录器到视频编辑器，有各种工具可以帮助创建良好的视频。提词器也是这样的工具之一。

提词器可以提供视觉提示，甚至是完整的文本，这样演讲者就可以在讲话时接受提示。你可能已经看到新闻读者使用提词器。

有专门的提词器软件，可以在电脑或移动设备上运行。

QPrompt 就是这样一款软件，它可以在 Linux、Windows 和其他平台上免费使用。

QPrompt：个人提词器软件



QPrompt 是一个提词器软件，适用于所有类型的视频创作者。它的主要重点是易用性和快速性能。

QPrompt 可与 Web 摄像头和手机、演播室提词器和平板提词器一起使用。它的独特能力是使其背景透明，这使得它在视频会议上表现出色。

以下是 QPrompt 的亮点功能：


可与演播室提词器、平板提词器、网络摄像头和电话一起使用

流畅移动，无抖动

可以在提示的同时进行即时修改

从其他软件中粘贴，不费力气

为你估算剩余时间

使用标记来跳到脚本的任何地方

向多个屏幕提示，有独立的镜像功能

背景透明，让你在讲话时可以看到你自己或你的听众

内置的计时器

进度指示器

丰富的文本格式

支持超过 180 种语言的书写系统


QPrompt 中的 “Q” 提示该应用是使用 Qt 框架制作的。它的用户界面使用 Kirigami 框架。所有这些都使它成为 KDE 上的一个很好的选择，但在 GNOME 中也是如此。

安装 QPrompt



QPrompt 是一个自由开源软件，它可以用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。也有适用于安卓设备的 APK，但目前还不稳定。

Linux 用户可以选择 AppImage、Snap 和 Deb文件。在写这篇文章的时候，Flatpak 包正在开发中。

你可以从该项目网站的下载区获得 AppImage。


下载 AppImage 格式的 QPrompt


其他安装选项可在其 GitHub 仓库的发布页面上找到：


其他下载选项


总结

我想对这个应用的功能进行评论，但由于我从未使用过提词器，我想我无法测试和“判断”其所有功能。如果你过去使用过这类软件，可以试试 QPrompt，看看它与其他同类软件的竞争情况。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

近年来，随着「双向链接」和「Zettelkasten」概念的兴起，和人们对更有效地记录笔记的需求的高涨，笔记软件的市场呈现出推陈出新和自我革新的局面。不仅有 Roam Research 和 Obsidian 等后起之秀凭借对这两种笔记法的率先支持获得广泛欢迎，一些传统笔记软件，例如 Notion，也在逐步加入相应的功能支持。
在这些丰富的笔记软件选择之外，还有另一个值得关注的软件，也通过特殊的方式实现了这些功能需求，那就是微软出品的文本编辑器 VS Code。VS Code 最为强大之处，在于可以通过丰富的扩展，将其定制成为自己专属且特化的应用（少数派中介绍将 VS Code 用作笔记软件的文章）。这篇文章要介绍的，便是在 VS Code 上实现「双向链接」和「Zettelkasten」功能的扩展：Foam。
少数派上目前有相当数量介绍「双向链接」和「Zettelkasten」概念的文章，且内容详尽、质量优秀。因此本文将聚焦于对 Foam 这一工具的介绍和自己的使用经验（也因为笔者实践 Zettelkasten 的时间较短，无法妄谈理解）。
在 官方主页 上，Foam 被定义为「受 Roam Research 启发的、依托于 VS Code 和 GitHub 的、管理和分享个人知识的系统」。你可以用它来组织研究、记录笔记或者在网络上发布内容。这篇文章中我们将主要把 Foam 作为构建笔记系统的工具。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[没有人会选择售价三、四十一晚的廉价旅馆。
如果不是穷游学生、迫于生计的求职者，走投无路的过路人，几乎鲜有人在这停留。破旧，肮脏，危险，狭小似乎是他们的代言词，敬而远之。
蜿蜒曲折，爬楼后的别样风景
个高的人想要上这样一个台阶非低头不可
一般来说，每一家小旅馆都有一条黑暗曲折只能允许一个人通行的小道，越往上，越黑暗。
廉价旅馆似乎都藏于这样的深巷之中
当你提着行李箱只身费九牛二虎之力走上这三折台阶，等待你的是个用玻璃围起来的小窗。只需朝着小窗吼上三四遍，老板自会从你未曾发觉的地方突然现身。
进一个巷口并不算困难，困难的是爬上这狭窄曲折的楼梯
大多数的时候，小旅馆的老板都在你看不见的窗口后面睡觉。有人唤的时候才会从搭建在小窗下的简易弹簧床上忽然坐起，然后一脸睡意的询问你单间还标间。
小旅馆的老板一般都藏在小玻璃窗口的后面
除了传统的身份人脸验证核对，老板会从抽屉里再掏出一本破旧小本，记下你的入住时间，预定平台和缴纳押金数额。一般来说，这种小旅馆的押金都比较少，几十块钱给个意思就行，全凭老板心情。
一台摆在大厅里的电脑就是个接待台了
办理好了一切，给到你的房卡也不过是一串绑着号码牌的钥匙串。好一点的小旅馆会有一个钥匙牌，直接插入门把手下端，进门之后还可以靠这个钥匙牌供电。
推门而进便是床铺，尽管空间狭小，但已是豪华高配
一般小旅馆的格局都不会很大，单人间也就是个睡觉的地儿。厕所和洗澡的地方一般不太会有单独的。晚上想洗个澡，内急想蹲个坑，只能出门右拐，走下一层楼到楼道尽头的洗漱池那，和所有住在这的人一起洗漱，一起蹲坑。
单人间一般没有独卫、电视，一张床便是全部
大多数人住这种旅馆都会担心卫生问题。旅馆里的公用厕所和洗漱间大多陈旧泛黄，尽管蹲坑的时候你得小心翼翼避开所有在地上的不堪。
蹲下来的时候面对的是一堆无痛人流医院广告，但基本的日常使用总是没什么问题的。不禁心里暗戳戳想到，“三十块钱，又要什么自行车呢？”
行走江湖，入住后的旅馆冷暖。
开在大学城附近的小旅馆倒是设备齐全
尽管是三十块的小旅馆，该有的倒是一个不差。电视，空调，WiFi，有的甚至还配上了麻将桌。只不过想要使用空调，多半得再交个十块钱，才能从老板那拿到遥控。
贴满墙纸似乎也能感受到老板的用心布置
电视别指望太好的显示效果，能响个声就算万幸，大多数甚至都没办法搜到频道。狭小的空间，想要在床上伸个懒腰甚至都是一件奢侈的事情。
在这种小旅馆里，不一定所有的床单都是白色
在这三十块一晚上的小旅馆，床单到底有没有一晚一换，估计也只有老板知道了。只要不是肉眼可见的肮脏，基本也就不太会每天更换了。
有的老板大概也担心你觉得旅馆太过于冷清，所以墙上倒也总能看到一些“温馨”画面。
墙壁上贴满荷花似乎白墙也就没有那么冰冷了
老板倒也直言不讳，“被套这东西哪有那个劲送专门的公司去洗，我们都是自己手洗。你以为送过去洗的有多干净？他到底给你洗了没他敢给你保证么，但我就敢保证我100%给你洗了。” 
格外温馨好看的床单，让人感觉像在家一样
大门和晾台布满了刚刚换下来的床单枕被套，在几条拉起来的废旧电线上还挂着刚刚入住在此的旅客换洗下来的衣物。
在门口晾晒的床单被套
南昌的夏天热的可怕，在天台暴晒一会儿倒是干起来很快。住在这儿的旅客也大多是来昌打工的讨生活者。在这暂住几天，找着工作就去工地上班，能省一点就是一点。
迫于生计，躺下后的片刻舒缓
粉色调的布置又是否觉得温馨
大多数的时候，想找一个安静且舒适的小旅馆并不是一件幸运的事儿。学生时代的我要想出去看看，住和交通，永远是最大的开销。廉价旅馆便是唯一的选择了。
尽管床铺就正对厕所，但有个独卫的单间已经很好了
用钥匙打开木门的第一眼就被惊讶了，与其说这是一间房，倒不如直接说是楼梯下的一个小空间。
隔音什么的也就基本不存在了。隔板那边的住客玩了一晚上消消乐，我竟然也难以置信的听了一晚上的Unbelievable。
房间与房间挨的这么近，发出点什么声响对门一准知道
彻夜难眠是在小旅馆常会发生的事儿，毕竟除了隔音糟糕会让你难以入睡，还有你搞不明白到底是什么的东西留下的床单印记让你整夜直犯恶心。

住进廉价小旅馆的人，多半是因为经济紧张才不得已选择。

拎着行李箱爬上那个幽暗狭窄的小楼梯时就注定今晚没法睡的安稳。可是，在没钱没工作的焦躁绝望中，又有多少睡在这的人会真的安稳入睡呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[春节「炸场子」那肯定非大红色系莫属了
不过大红色也分不同的色温色调，我来推荐几个我自己很喜欢的大红色系口红，唇膏唇釉，哑光亮面都有，应该会有你喜欢/适合你的一款
（为了好看唇周有磨皮美白，但是嘴唇本嘴是没有磨皮没有调色的，手上的试色是啥都没调过的原图，仅供参考）
阿玛尼红管唇釉 #405

最出圈的烂番茄色，老网红了，但是真的很漂亮，我用过不少烂番茄色，用来用去还是405最好看，每年秋冬都会拿出来用

厚涂非常浓郁，非常显白，整个脸都亮了的感觉，跟毛衣大衣绝配，不成膜会沾杯，但是不用担心掉色，因为掉色之后底色也还在，基本就是薄涂的效果，而405薄涂也很好看！


NARS黑管唇釉 Light my fire

也是橘调的红色，但是比阿玛尼405更亮，差不多是非荧光的橘红色里最亮的一个，非常抓人眼球，用来「炸场子」非常合适哈哈哈

处于染唇液和唇釉之间的那种质地，很轻薄但是遮盖力显色度绝了，干的快会成膜，在嘴上扒的很牢，吃饭啥的不会掉，注意卸妆的时候用眼唇卸妆液多敷会儿

资生堂 银座细管口红 #220

又是一个偏橘的红，不过这个是粉橘调，很像是大红灯笼点亮之后的那种红色，膏体带一点点金闪，但是上嘴之后看不出有闪片，有很自然的光泽感

薄涂粉调比较明显，很嫩，挺日常的，厚涂橘调就明显了，虽然是唇膏但是涂的时候很丝滑，很润不拔干，不过持久度也一般


YSL金圆管唇膏 #83

终于到蓝调的红了，不过黄皮也没问题，不是玫红那种，很妙的一个颜色，薄涂是水红，厚涂棕调就出来了，比草莓红更知性，比砖红更活泼

是改版之后的新质地，不假润了，膏体也带细闪，上最看不出来，但是光泽感很漂亮，显得嘴很饱满

MAC 子弹头 Cockney

标准的草莓红，膏体带金闪，上嘴也能看到一点点闪，青春活泼，跟YSL 83相比更适合年轻的妹子，玫调更明显一点，不太适合黄黑皮


丝芙兰 哑光唇釉 #01

虽然叫樱桃红，但是我觉得这个是一个非常非常正的大红色，不偏橘也不偏玫，哑光丝绒感很漂亮，干了之后不沾杯，持久度也很不错
如果你不知道自己适合哪种大红，就选这个正红，厚涂不会出错的


商品链接
下面是我能找到的链接，incase我写的商品名称不够准确，或者你们种草了想买

猜你喜欢
春节「炸场子」只有口红不太够哟，美甲也不要忘↓
有没有什么好看的不易翻车的美甲款式？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[提前了解一下 Pop!_OS 即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境。仅供参考。




如果你还不知道，System76 的开发者一直在 致力于开发一个新的桌面环境（被称为 COSMIC），它是用 Rust 编写的，Rust 是一种内存安全的超快编程语言。

从头开始创建一个桌面环境不是一件小事。这涉及到创建从合成器、面板、窗口管理器到桌面环境的 API 和其他后端任务的一切。

这不是一件容易的事，而维护它又是另一回事。

而且，看起来 System76 已经开始了这方面的工作。

在 GitHub 上，你会发现已经有一个名为 cosmic 的仓库，但它主要是使用 JavaScript（用于创建 GNOME shell 扩展的语言）编写的。这就是 cosmic shell 扩展仓库，也就是 Pop!_OS 现在所搭载的。

在他们的 GitHub 中还有几个较新的仓库，这些恰好是他们即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面的元素。

所以，现在是时候构建、测试并提前了解一下了。


注： 澄清一下，目前 Pop!_OS 上基于 GNOME 的桌面环境叫做 COSMIC。而本文讨论的是基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，它是从头开始构建的，旨在取代当前的产品。


基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验

打算成为 COSMIC 桌面环境整体一部分的三个仓库是：


设置应用

顶部面板（目前用于 X11 系统）

合成器（似乎支持原生的 wayland、xwayland 和 X11 系统）


COSMIC 设置应用




注意： 这是一个半生不熟的早期预览，以让你有个大致印象。随着开发的继续，用户界面可能会有根本性的变化。所以，仅用于参考。


这是 Pop!_OS 的新 COSMIC 桌面的设置应用。它目前还在开发当中，没有准备好使用，不过如果你想运行它并试试界面，请随意！

那么，它看起来与目前的 COSMIC 体验有什么不同呢？



在写这篇文章时，该用户界面似乎没有与任何后端 API 相连接。启用和禁用 “为工作区启用左上角热角 ”的切换并没有什么变化，其他的切换也是如此，除了设置应用的 “关于” 部分所显示的信息。

仔细看截图，放置的位置很凌乱，但作为早期预览（或原型）来说也是正常的。

看起来他们正在用圆角和更干净的外观来处理一切。

切换动画感觉快速、流畅和迅捷（即使是在虚拟机内，我等不及在裸机上尝试）。但考虑到它甚至还没有功能，谈论性能没什么意义。



就个人而言，我不喜欢他们所采用的圆角外观。在我看来，GNOME 对圆角的实现是完美的。但是，看看它的结果应该是很有趣的。

顶部面板

作为 COSMIC 桌面环境的一部分，顶部面板也正在使用 Rust 语言实现。

至于这个顶部面板的外观，我不太确定如何测试它才不算对它不公平。从 GNOME 中启动它，会在 GNOME 的顶栏后面打开它。所以我想在一个单独的窗口管理器中打开它（到目前为止只用 bspwm 和 i3-wm 试过），但这导致了一些古怪的行为，比如面板像普通 GUI 软件一样占据了全部垂直空间。

COSMIC 合成器

COSMIC 桌面环境的合成器编译成功了，但在与 bspwm 或 i3-wm 一起使用时却无法启动。我试着在窗口管理器中启动它，因为 GNOME 不允许改变合成器。

这是由于在使用 VirtualBox 的虚拟机中，视频驱动的混乱以及 COSMIC 合成器还没有准备好。

但是，还有更多！

开发者 Eduardo Flores 也尝试了新的 COSMIC 桌面，在他的 博客文章 中分享了一些应用启动器和坞站的截图。



应用程序启动器看起来很相似，但是使用 GTK 构建的。同样，你也可以期待 Pop!_OS 21.10 引入一个类似的应用程序库，以及经典的坞站。



总结

当然，现在说发展的方向还为时过早。

要期待一个成熟的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验的测试版，应该还需要一段时间。

但是，从我们在这里看到的情况来看，我很兴奋。

你怎么看？欢迎你在下面的评论中分享你的想法！

大家好 ，我是加勒比考斯。
很高兴再次和大家见面~
前言
笔者目前有4台旧的笔记本电脑，而且这4台还一直都在使用，来回切换发现这几台屏幕色差真的不是一般的大啊，而且后续笔者还要做视频，还要换屏幕，所以咬了咬牙，直接在狗东下单了一个Datacolor的红蜘蛛校色仪，后面准备来一个一个进行校正。其中有3台在家里，一台在办公室，咱们先从家中开始。

 
Datacolor的校色仪目前主要分为两个系列，分别是红蜘蛛和蓝蜘蛛，两者在核心校色方面并没有太多差别，都可以正常使用，但是如果你是专业的设计师或者视频工作者，那么推荐选择红蜘蛛，它拥有更多专业向的功能，测试和分析工具也更齐全。

 
考斯目前一共有4台笔记本电脑，这数量也是多的让人发愁，而且还不好淘汰。其中一台是2020年MacBook Air M1丐版，出差修图剪视频使用，不得不说苹果的优化做的真的好，修图剪视频没有比这个更合适的了。

 
第二台是是17年买的一个戴尔游侠游戏本，这个游戏本我拿来打英雄联盟，一个8年的英雄联盟老玩家，每个周都要来几把排位，现在还是青铜段位混，也是丢脸了。
第三台是一个是19年买的荣耀笔记本MagicBook，这台主要是媳妇儿用来看剧用，用起来简单轻便，而且还可以触屏，媳妇儿一直很喜欢。
第四台是公司发的惠普战66笔记本电脑，公司全部都是用的自己的办公套件，想用自己的电脑很难，只能用公司发的电脑。
这4台电脑是每天都在用，但是来回切换后对比后发现这个色差特别严重，尤其是那台游戏本是采用了的TN屏幕，戴尔游戏本屏幕素质真的是创业界新低，而且当初还是7000块钱买的。

Is there a way I can reinstall Arch from the bootstick I still have?  
I've been following this tutorial, and how my system and it differs is that all of my partitions have "unknown filesystems".
Here's a backlog:

    error: disk `lvmid/MMwt86-jYqe-hUn1 ... zo7KQw' not found.
    Entering rescue mode...
    grub rescue> ls
    (hd0) (hd1) (hd1,gpt2) (hd1,gpt1)
    grub rescue> ls (hd0)
    (hd0): File-system is unknown.
    grub rescue> set
    cmdpath=(hd1,gpt1)/EFI/grub_uefi
    prefix=(lvmid/MMwt86-jYqe ... zo7KQw)/boot/grub
    root=lvmid/MMwt86-jYqe-hUn1-x1eI-sqCk-RoXD-NihFx4/49zeY2-wEvE-jsN6-2EqG-5TW4-CeLE-zo7KQe
    grub rescue>


And the same error I get for (hd0) applies to the other three ((hd1), (hd1,gpt2), and (hd1,gpt1)).
IMPORTANT NOTE:
(hd1,) is my bootstick. Removing it beforehand results in (hd0) (hd0,gpt2) (hd0,gpt1).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


You're probably thinking," what's new with comments?" and you'll be right to think that.

Avoid writing redundant comments
Comments should be updated
Do not excuse bad code with commenting
Comments should not reference other codes
Comments should be informative
Comments could be used to provide links to original source code
Comments should not be used for attribution
The rest of this article explains these guides and provides examples to them.

The above is common among early-beginners as they're introduced to code, While this could be very helpful with teaching beginners. Its considered redundant as it adds no information and merely causes visual clutter.
Overtime comments silently degrade. While code is continuously updated, the comments are forgotten. For a code cryptic in nature, readers turn to the comments to provide an explanation, and when that explanation is false it leaves the readers confused or worse mislead.

The asterisks in the regex pattern show that  it matches a whole lot more than it was stated by the comments which could be very misleading to the readers who do not bother to check the regex pattern.
Commenting should be used as a last resort. Every comment serves as a failure to express yourself clearly in code. Always try to clean the code to express yourself better before resulting to commenting. 

After cleaning it up

A comment should not reference a code that is not present or local because the reference code could change but the comment wouldn't




Comments like these are unacceptable especially in production. The source code control systems can always tell who the author was.
I hope this article has been helpful in highlighting the importance of writing  proper comments and the guides provided were well understood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript has many quirks and difficult-to-understand behaviors. There are hilarious talks such as WTFJS and WAT that make fun of JavaScript for its strangeness.
Since I work on refactorings, I have to consider many weird and sometimes funny sides of JavaScript. I will share some of the surprising behaviors that I encounter, so if you see them (which you hopefully never will), it might hint at what's going on.
This blog post explores an innocent-looking statement:
// ... some code

helloWorld;

You might intuitively think that nothing should happen here - the statement seems to do nothing because there is no obvious function call here.
However, it can do anything, for example, print "Hello World!" to the console.
// ... some code

helloWorld;           // prints "Hello World!"

How can this even be possible?
It turns out that global variables (in this case, helloWorld) are properties of the global object. And properties in JavaScript do not have to be simple values. They can be implemented using getters and setters, which can execute code. Since the global object inherits from Object.prototype in modern JavaScript engines, adding properties to Object.prototype creates properties on the global object.
Here, helloWorld is defined as such a getter:
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {
  get() { console.log("Hello World!"); },
});

helloWorld;           // prints "Hello World!"

Thankfully this can only happen with global variables, and not with parameters or local variables.
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {
  get() { console.log("Hello World!"); },
});

const a = helloWorld; // getter is evaluated, prints "Hello World!"
a;                    // does nothing

I learned about this strange behavior in a blog post about the globalThis polyfill. In the polyfill, a global property getter is used to access the global this object in different environments such as browsers, web workers, frames, Node.js, and ES modules. Have a look if you want to know more!]]></summary>

Hey guys, it's been a long time! If you don't already know me, my name is Ethan and I'm one of a few Peregrine Programming Language developers. Over the past few months, we've managed to surpass the progress in the 1st write (code for the 1st write has been deleted) and add new features. This post will be discussing the progress that has been made.
If you know Python, you know how easy it is. However, it also comes with a big downgrade. Python is slow, and I'm pretty sure every python developer knows this by now. This is kind of annoying. That's where Peregrine comes in. Me and 11 friends have been working on Peregrine for the past few months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you know of the red car syndrome?
When we learn and start using a new language, or especially a framework, we tend to see how some people do something.
But my point is not that after start learning something you start seeing everywhere and all the people using it... but that people will follow “tradition” blindly. In Python, the community has the saying of something being the “pythonic way”.
Yes, you should embrace “tradition” and make things simpler for everyone... except when you don’t.
Many React developers out there will start a project and add Redux (or MobX, or Recoil... ) without even thinking if the project will even need it.
And after they do that, since it’s already there it’s easy to just “go with the motion” and just make things in a way to use Redux.
There’s this story that you might have heard, it’s about someone trying to learn the family recipe of baking fish and that “you have to cut the tail to make it good” and then they would go from parent to grandparent to ask why you have to make the cut only to be told that it’s “how it’s always been done to make it good”, and finally the great grandparent will say that the oven was too small back in the day and they had to cut it to fit...
And as history repeats itself, if you found anything I’m saying eerie familiar, then yes, more than 10 years ago Uncle Bob wrote that developers would start a project with a database because “you always needed a database right?”.
Redux is just one of the latest... moment.js, Lodash, jQuery... remember then?
Remember that the problem is not if you are or not using then, but WHY are you using it.

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
Since our application may incorporate a large number of functions and global variables from various source files, it's critical to keep the number of global variables to a minimum.
We could utilize the IIFE pattern if we have some initiation code that we don't need to use again. Because we won't be reusing the code, IIFE is preferable than a function declaration or a function expression in this scenario.
(function () {
  // some initiation code
  let firstVariable;
  let secondVariable;
})();

firstVariable and secondVariable will be discarded after the function is executed.

We would also use IIFE to create private and public variables and methods.

The Scope Chain is the hierarchy of scopes that will be searched in order to find a function or variable.

Credits- Anuradha Aggarwal
When a variable is used in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine will try to find the variable’s value in the current scope. If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.
If it’s still could not find the variable, it will either implicitly declare the variable in the global scope (if not in strict mode) or return an error.
The Scope Chain is used to resolve variables. When asked to resolve a variable, JavaScript always starts at the innermost level of the code nest and keeps jumping back to the parent scope until it finds the variable …]]></summary>

PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛
前言
又是一年新春，在这里先给大家拜个早年了。每逢春节，写春联贴春联都是一项必不可少的活动。本次主要使用Compose，实现手写春联的效果。如果对你有所帮助，欢迎点个赞或者评论鼓励一下~

生成的春联

主要思路
事件监听
我们需要实现手写春联效果，首先就是要做事件监听，Android中自然是监听Action_Down，Action_Move，Action_UP，Compose中应该如何处理呢?
Compose中也可以利用pointerInteropFilter监听Action_Down，Action_Move，Action_UP,如下所示
Column(modifier = Modifier.pointerInteropFilter {
    when (it.action) {
        MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN -> {}
        MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE -> {}
        MotionEvent.ACTION_UP -> {}
        else ->  false
    }
     true
})

路径绘制
当我们手写春联的时候，实际上就是把我们触摸过的点连接起来，最直接的想法当然是通过Path来绘制，即把各个点连接成Path,然后通过drawPath来绘制
drawPath只支持固定的宽度，因此不符合我们的要求。
所以我们换个思路，drawPath其实也是将各个点连接起来，如果我们将触摸过程中的点记录下来，然后在这一系列的点上画圆不就行了吗？每个圆的半径可以自定义，但这样会带来以下问题

过去几年购买了差不多 50 张专辑，也从 PT 站下载了 100 多张别人分享的专辑，打算上传到用 S3 桶+rclone 搭建的私人曲库中。因为自己抓的都是 wav ，加上 PT 站下载的那些（已排除扫描图）统计了下有 70GB 了。因为 wav 格式偏大，网络传输不便（因为没有保留照片和巨大微信聊天记录的需求（定期重装微信，重要内容截图），手上的设备都是 64GB 版本，存不下大量无损音乐，需要在线听）用的是每月按使用容量计费的 S3 桶当网盘（本地不方便搭建 NAS ，不相信国内外任何网盘服务的隐私保护，只能用 AWS 的 S3 桶+DigitalOcean 上的 rclone 实时加解密），能省一点不必要的容量是一点，于是想把它们全部转为 flac 保存，但我不想丢失任何的细节，请问有工具能满足此需求吗？另外我是用 Exact Audio Copy 抓的整轨，有工具能通过.cue 文件在不重新抓轨的情况下无损的将它们切为分轨么？最好能通过命令行调用，因为专辑比较多且比较杂，我想写脚本来完成这两件事。]]></summary>

来个引导
1.做了很久的 saas 微信商铺系统，不想再做了
2.过了今天，我的项目就跨度三年了
3.虽然还没有完工， 但我还是迫不及待的想“炫技”下我的项目
4.分享下我的独立开发日记 01
5.分享下我的独立开发日记 02
6.分享下我的独立开发日记 03
7.分享下我的独立开发日记 04
项目简介: 以微商城+支付营销为主体的私域 saas 项目；
项目网址: http:www.f-space.cn:6060
总结：
周末两天是效率最高的时候，吃饭、睡觉、拉屎、写屎代码 就这几件事情。。
这两天一共写了 2069 行代码，删了 1781 行，完成了一个大的模块，修复了 13 个大的 bug ， 其他小的修复未计数
统计了下代码量
行数：57,540 (全部手写，主要为 python 、js 、css ）
项目完成度增加 10%， 由 70% 到 80%。
预计在春节前，会完成所有的后台功能，春节后将开始 App 端的开发。。。
一个这样的产品
具备较完善的产品逻辑
复杂的逻辑放在后端，用户端具备较简介的 UI 操作
打通后端,App 端、硬件端的完整流程
成熟的设计、产品逻辑、完善的后端程序、较低廉的硬件连通
由我一个人从零开始创建，即将完成，内心还是非常自豪的一件事情
ps：年前将暂停开发日记，年后继续总结]]></summary>

事情是这样的，我有一台 asus 的笔记本，自带了 DTS 音效。前两天打 Apex ，发现声音特别小。然后想起来有个东西叫 DTS 音效的 App ，打开一看直接闪退，遂重装该软件和驱动，也重装了声卡相关的驱动。但是没什么用。
必应上面一搜同款机型（同模具）好多都出现了类似问题，找华硕客服也没什么结果，就让你重装驱动，恢复至出厂系统。
可能你会问那 DTS 不好使就不用呗，但是不用的话声音特别小，特别特别小的那种。
于是我就盯上了 Dolby ，之前的旧笔记本装一个带 Dolby 的 Realtek 驱动就能用 Dolby 音效了，因为我现在这个也是 Realtek 声卡（应该是吧），我想现在是不是也这么简单，就装了，果然不好使。
所以有没有懂这个的能指导一下如何安装 Dolby 音频驱动或者怎么让 DTS 能用，另外我也不是很懂我这个电脑的音频架构，感觉好像还和 Intel 有什么关系，不装那个 isst 的驱动就没有声。
折腾的我感觉像回到了 Windows 98 时代哈哈哈

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[21年颇为戏剧和魔幻，事情太多；上下半年的行业巨变，好像经历了两个年头：迟迟没有想好应该怎么做个小结。
回头看，投资似乎是一个不错的固定视角，贯穿全年，总算有点话讲。


往期内容
20年：年终小结：从跨端到内容平台
19年：年终小结，赛道思考与机会判断

一
彼时还没有元宇宙，我在20年Epic Games的哲学与抱负里把metaverse翻作“元世界”（起名的本事真差）。21年开年clubhouse爆红，给metaverse浇了一把新油。
一场上海游戏圈大佬们的秉烛夜谈吸引了无数人在clubhouse围观，Dash老板那句“腾讯的社交不过是纸老虎”言犹在耳（笑），但Steven老板很客气、中肯地作了总结发言。末了，我们听出来了：腾讯心里只有育碧、动视之流；眼里，是半个米哈游。
但在国内，其实还有字节在腾讯眼皮上跳动。


二
都知道字节要做游戏，但in house自建就得尊重内容产业的规律，大力出不了奇迹；于是字节开始一路买买买，从拿产品到买管线，并且高价搅动市场行情。
所以20年下半年开始，腾讯就全面加强在国内的游戏投资，21年尤甚，实行“三不原则”，不干涉经营决策、不主导项目、不寻求发行权。但很多权益上要求排“他”，不要和那谁玩。
神仙打架，跑马圈地，其他厂商也坐不住，只能纷纷跟注。卷起来了，有人就出更高的价钱，拿更少的权益，比口袋深度，卷死你们。战略投资人纷纷退化成了财务投资人，甚至不在乎财务回报的财务投资人（?）；财务机构一看，咱们起跑线一致了，也抓住机会纷纷入局。一时间好不热闹。
当然，钱不迷路，总有人赚。别管是面子还是里子，天底下只有你情我愿的买卖。win-win，都赢麻了。


三
不好说各家成绩单，但加总算下来过去一年超过200个团队拿到钱吧。
对买家来说，有人拿到二次元最后的门票，国产3A的门面，有人拿到成熟的管线、海量的用户，其实价格不重要。
更重要…]]></summary>

本文以 HomeBridge 为例，HomeBridge 运行在 Ubuntu 系统的树莓派上。安装和使用 HomeBridge 请参考这篇文章：HomeBridge 操作指南：从零开始，将你的米家设备接入 Homekit
本次接入的原理是根据 Github 上开源的 PlayStation 唤醒软件进行配置，再接入到 HomeBridge 调用运行配置好的唤醒软件。从而达到曲线救国的 PlayStation 的 HomeKit 化，接下来我们就分步骤进行安装与配置。
安装控制软件
本方法使用 playactor 控制软件来操控 PlayStation 系统。由于 PlayStation 并不支持传统的 WoL ，现在有的方法原理都是基于索尼自家的 PS Remote Play 这款软件的原理进行开发的。

根据 playactor 项目的文档，本项目支持 PS4 的全部操作和 PS5 的部分操作。在加入 HomeKit 之后我们仅需要用到 Wake 与 Standby 两个指令即可。


 PS4PS5
Wake✅✅
Standby✅✅
Keyboard control✅❌
Key/Button press✅❌
App/Game start✅❌


首先我们进入到运行 HomeBridge 的主机中，安装软件。在终端中输入：
sudo npm install playactor
等待安装完成。如果是 Docker 中运行的 HomeBridge 请直接在 HomeBridge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我还记得自己第一次见到 Surface Laptop Go 是在北京三里屯的一家顺电。对自己的 MacBook Pro 早已审美疲劳的我，说实话，对 Surface 系列的设计一直都是十分欣赏的。3:2 的 12.4 英寸屏幕比例、舒适的键盘和触控板，以及触摸屏 —— Surface Laptop Go 符合一切我对于上网本的期待。只不过，当时的我只是简简单单的欣赏，并没有什么购买欲。
情况在今年发生了改变。首先是，我把用了多年的 2016 款 13 英寸 MacBook Pro 出掉了，换了 M1 的 Mac mini 作为日常使用的 Mac 机器。这是因为，尽管 MacBook Pro 十分便携，它的性能早已跟不上我的需要了。至于移动办公的需求，单位配发的 Dell Latitude 7390 实际上体验尚可，如果它不是那么快就坏掉了的话。
LOL，线过于杂乱，请勿介意
如今的轻薄笔记本，其实有不少的选择。一来，MacBook Air 因为配备了 M1 处理器而变得性能强劲且续航优秀；二来，在 Windows 阵营，联想小新、小米、华为等一众国产品牌推出的轻薄款笔记本无论是性能还是价格都还不错。至于我为什么最终选择了 Surface Laptop Go，主要原因是这样的：首先，我也已经提到了我对这款笔记本的设计钟爱有加。考虑到 12.4 英寸 3:2 的屏幕，它看起来小巧精致，但是在内容的显示上倒是也毫不含糊，相比 16:9 或者 16:10 的传统比例，能够显示的内容更多。其次，最近对于 Excel 的高需求，让我无法安心使用一台 Mac 电脑承担所有的工作；加之 MacBook Air 在 2022 年有极大的可能更新设计与处理器，现在的我已经不敢轻举妄动。最后，其他厂商的笔记本尽管性能上要强劲许多，但是在设计上总有那么一些让我觉得不太舒服的地方。总之，说服自己买 …]]></summary>

几年前使用免费的腾讯企业邮箱，绑定域名，设置解析就可以添加成员使用了，群晖 NAS 使用 SMTP 发信很方便
忘记从什么时候开始，要么强制要求三个月修改一次登录密码，要么强制绑定微信扫码登录，SMTP 服务也要强制使用授权码登录，我忍了
又过了一段时间，微信服务通知每天都提醒我加入 XXXX 企业微信，下载企业微信登录一看，居然直接给我注册了企业微信，完全没经过我的同意，一怒之下点开企业管理，解散企业
一直到今天，想要登录企业邮箱，扫码登录，发现我的企业邮箱没了。。。然后我想起来了之前解散企业的操作。。。越想越气
然后尝试重新注册腾讯企业邮箱，发现是直接跳转到企业微信的注册界面，嗯，企业邮箱已经成为了企业微信的附属功能，使用腾讯企业邮需必须同时开通企业微信。]]></summary>

许多搜索引擎会通过用户输入的关键词、搜索历史、浏览记录、停留时间来收集用户可能感兴趣的内容，进而针对性地投放个性化广告。而无追搜索就号称不进行这种用户追踪行为。
无追搜索承诺，不收集不追踪用户个人信息，也没有繁杂的个性化广告。（并不是完全没广告，而是没有与你搜索行为相关的广告）值得一提的是，无追搜索实现隐私保护的关键，是在默认情况下不使用 Cookie 。
无追搜索的最大特点是在无追搜索中，用户行为数据会被去标识化，也就是用户输入的关键词、点击的链接、访问时间、停留时长等数据会被收集。
但是在经过技术处理后，这些信息无法识别到特定的个人，再搭配无追搜索没有账号体系的特点，用户隐私确实能够得到一定的保障。

用了 10 年 Android 设备，今年想要个趁手的平板，选择了 iPad mini 6 。
当我想把以前的照片导入到 iPad 上的时候，问题出现了：
使用 iTunes 导入，相当于把电脑的目录同步到 iPad 上，但 iPad 却不能删除某个照片，只能插线到电脑上，在电脑上删除照片，再重新把这个目录同步到 iPad 中；
使用爱思助手，拷贝进去之后，也不能在 iPad 端删除拷进去的照片，估计和 iTunes 调的是一样的 API ；
这下终于体会到了苹果的设计哲学，你必须按照它设想的场景去使用，必须使用 iCloud 云服务，否则你手里的设备就是一坨 SHIT 。
必须组合使用 Mac+iPad+iPhone+iWatch 才能达到所谓的“体验”，一旦你有一台 Windows 、Android 设备，想把他们一期使用，绝对是灾难，其中那个不兼容的搅屎棍一定就是苹果。]]></summary>

常年居家办公中，桌子不够大，目前只有一台显示器。
显示器分别接公司的 Macbook Pro 和自己的 Mac mini M1 ，两台电脑都配有各自的 Magic Keyboard 和 Mouse 。
目前的做法是，需要用哪台电脑的时候从显示器的 Input 里选源。
之前遇到的问题是，有时候切换 Input 后电脑无法识别出显示器，需要切断显示器电源才可以识别，非常的痛苦。
目前我在想到的是通过一个 KVM 来解决，但市面上 KVM 产品鱼龙混在，考虑到以下因素：
1 、是否支持 Type C 口（因为我的两台电脑都是 Type C 输出，显示器也支持 Type C ）
2 、不需要共享鼠标键盘，越简单越好（便宜？）
3 、是够支持 60HZ 刷新率（有些设备貌似就只能到 30HZ ）
4 、是否支持反向充电（目前我的两台电脑都是通过显示器的线反向充电的）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[huangya: 
我在闲鱼上卖个 AP ，但是当时没细看买家的情况，只看了有一千多单，主要是远程装系统和清理系统的单子。
买家卖前还让我提供各种 web 截图，问各种功能。因为我对路由器和 AP 非常懂，所以也一一给他回答了。发出之前，我还专门测试了一天多，跑了 100 多 G 流量。当时没太在意就给他发货了。并且是我付的快递费用。
后来卖家收到后过了一天，说不能上网，要退货。我看到是连着 AP 的，这在技术上很难讲通的。然后就要他 ping 一下是否能 ping 通主路由。然后就要远程来看一下。卖家死活不愿意，还说自己每天要下地干活，6 点钟起来晚上 8 点钟回来，装模作样还说要视频给我看。当时在上班就没有视频，他就要给我拍了个视频，我一看，就在马路旁边的一块地里。后来就深入看了一下卖家的情况和当时的交易记录，发现卖家也卖路由器和 AP ，稍微懂点皮毛技术。他的评价明显就是刷出来的。卖家还会用软路由爬墙。卖家说自己是农民工，兼职干 IT. 呵呵，V 友相信吗？反正卖家谎话一堆，漏洞太多了，V 友想听的话，我可以 append.
所以，我推测卖家退货可能有其他原因，比如他本来想卖给其他人（买家卖路由器和 AP 基本上是同城交易），但由于各种原因，没卖掉，就找我退货。故意截了两张不能上网的图。其实这图很容易伪造形成，只要把 AP 连接在主路由的网线拔掉就可以。由于怕露馅，就死活不让我远程看。我就拒接退货。中间跟他拉拉扯扯，搞了好久。越扯发现买家的谎言越多，骗子的本性也暴露越多。后来我主动请客服加入。现在结果出来了，但让我不解的时候，
判决结果是“淘宝支持卖家"（如图）, 但是仍然让我提供”退货地址",并且短信也让我确认默认地址是否正确，同时短信也提到邮寄回来的费用是买家负责。所以这个判决结果，到底是淘宝支持我还是支持买家？如果是支持买家，我真是对闲鱼客服失望透顶。看来以后卖二手，我是必须要严加审核，加个“骗子，二道无良贩子有多远滚多远，死一户口本”了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌移除了 Chromium 的预置搜索引擎的“移除”按钮

我们都知道，如果你不想要浏览器预置的默认搜索引擎，可以从浏览器设置中移除它。然而，最近的 Chromium 97 的更新对这些设置进行了 修改，移除了预置的搜索引擎的“移除”按钮。Chromium 开发者对此回应称，删除这些搜索引擎“具有不可恢复的破坏性，因为即使你有足够的知识来使用添加对话框重新创建一个预填充的条目，也不能设置建议、新标签页或其他专门的 URL”。因此，他强烈倾向于“菜单中根本没有删除选项”。其它基于 Chromium 的浏览器，如 Chrome、Edge ，也将无法移除预置搜索引擎。


老王点评：我觉得这是一种邪恶的解决方案，即便如其所说，无法手工重新恢复预置信息，也可以提供一个恢复按钮，而不是剥夺用户删除的自由。




youtube-dl 网站的托管商被各大唱片公司起诉

之前，RIAA 曾经试图施压 GitHub，以关闭 youtube-dl 项目，虽然这一努力最终以失败而告终。但是现在索尼、环球和华纳正在 起诉 Uberspace，该公司目前是 youtube-dl 的官方主页的托管者。他们称，youtube-dl 给他们的业务带来了风险，使用户能够通过规避 YouTube 的技术措施下载他们艺术家的版权作品。因此，如果 Uberspace 不希望自己承担法律责任，就不应该通过托管其网站来参与该工具的运作，该工具本身托管在其他地方。


老王点评：要是 youtube-dl 下一步把网站托管到 GitHub pages 上会怎么样。




俄罗斯逮捕了多名 REvil 勒索软件黑帮成员

俄罗斯联邦安全局周五 宣布，应美国当局要求逮捕了 14 名 REvil 勒索软件黑帮成员，扣押了大量现金、加密货币和和计算机、汽车等资产。REvil 是近期最活跃的勒索软件组织之一，在美国向俄罗斯施压之后，REvil 在去年 7 月关闭了服务器，但其管理员在 9 月尝试重启业务，随后其暗网网站遭到美国执法机构关闭，之后彻底消失。


老王点评：终于被俄罗斯官方拿下了。]]></summary>

我们那时候我记得 60 分以下的都是一大堆， 各位数的才有资格当倒数。
他说是怕孩子高中被分流， 想办法要给孩子补课。 我觉得现在的家长是恐慌性补课， 他们想的不是什么成才， 而是不能被别人挤下桥。

项目是 django 使用 celery 做一些异步任务执行。
目前发现部署后，django view 中调用 celery 异步执行任务时，遇到一个诡异的问题
方法中的一条模型查询语句，在该异步方法被执行一定次数后会直接卡死。
但是我改成直接用 django.db.connections 执行 sql 语句去查询结果，就没这个问题。  
目前发现异步任务方法大概被执行一定数量范围后，就会触发卡死的问题。
而且在这个次数范围内必现。  
当次执行卡死后，再次执行该异步任务，大概率就不会卡死了。  
不知道有没有其他小伙伴遇到这么诡异的问题的，或者有没有原因的可能思路。
django 版本用的是 2.1.5
celery 版本是 4.4.2
感激不尽。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[golangLover: 
最近在管理 gradle / maven 写的源码，想问下平时是不需要做这个传递依赖的冲突检查吗，等抛出异常的时候才做还是每次安装依赖的时候都要做一次？
最怕的问题在于不知道为什么编译期的版本冲突没有检查出来。而我们已经依赖了好多个 library,例如库 A 依赖 库 C 和库 D 的 1.0 ，但是库 B 是依赖库 C 和 D 的 2.0 。
我在网上看了 maven 和 gradle 会自动帮我以某种最短路径策略去选择依赖库。但是这种选择我也不懂是不是能够保证选择出来的版本就是没问题的，总不能每次都重新测试整个 app 吧。
而这种传递依赖的层级可能有 3/4 层。而我恰好前两天就遇到一个 java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError 。查了一下好像是关于依赖不兼容的问题， 编译期间没有检查出来，还是使用哪个 method 的时候才出现的 runtime exception 。
问题是我在最上层 dependency management 例如写了是 2.0 ，那我也不能保证依赖 1.0 的一定没问题的。但写成 2.0 的，那风险也同样大。
所以想向大家求教应该怎么做依赖的管理的最好方法。谢谢大家]]></summary>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

引子：这一次，咱们来聊聊摩托车
首先，作为少数派 Matrix 社区的新人作者，在新的一年里，向大家问好。
关注少数派很长时间了，有幸能看到这么多优秀的人和优秀的文章，也许是由于少数派是以科技和效率为主的网站，尽管在分享「生活方式」的文章中，有关「摩托」的话题也不是很多。（当然除了摩托罗拉），所以在这里我想和各位少数派的朋友分享一下「我为什么骑摩托车」。
不得不说，确实是刘德华主演的电影《烈火战车》给我埋下了摩托车的种子，但是在家人眼中，摩托车常常与「危险、浮躁、不正经」等贬义词挂钩。好在我从没提过想骑摩托车，所以也免去了在购买前和家人辩论的过程。
《烈火战车》剧照，图片来自豆瓣
随着近几年短视频的兴起，机车文化得到了一定的传播和发展，并且得益于各地「禁摩令」不同程度地取消，摩托车也成为了越来越多人的出行和生活方式，如果你也有兴趣入坑机车，那本文会有我的一些建议可供参考，另外为了提升易读性，本文不涉及动力、扭矩等参数。推荐入坑前可以关注「哈罗摩托」、「骑士网」等相关网站获取更专业的信息。如果有问题也可以直接在评论或私信中向我提问。
从复古车型到入手爱车
尽管很多摩友入坑的多数目的是追求速度与激情，但是我一直认为速度附带的刺激程度和危险系数是同等的，刺激和危险并不能形成对冲关系，所以在选购方面，我第一时间排除了仿赛车型（偏速度），只留意复古车型。

hello 大家好，我是《Flutter开发实战详解》的作者郭树煜，看标题就知道今天我要给大家分享的是 Flutter 相关的主题，分享内容是也比较直接简单，就是关于 Flutter 布局相关的知识点。
相信大家可能都听说过或者用过 Flutter ，对这部分内容可能有一定了解，但是正如标题所示，本次的主题是带你了解不一样的 Flutter ，或者说经常性被萌新忽略的东西 ，所以这次将通过不一样的角度，带你看看 Flutter 的尺寸布局有趣的地方。
一、开始之前
在聊 Flutter 的布局之前，首先大家觉得 Flutter 是什么？
Flutter 其实主要是跨平台的 UI 框架，它核心能力是解决 UI 的跨平台，和别的跨平台框架不一样的地方在于：它在性能接近原生的同时，做到了控件和平台无关的实现。
但如果大家用过 Flutter ，应该知道 Flutter 里的我们写的界面都是通过 Widget 完成，并且可能会看起来嵌套得很多层，为什么呢？
这里就要先简单说一下 Flutter 的一些基础信息，在 Flutter 里有 Widget 、 Element、 RenderObject 、 Layer 等关键的核心设定。

其中我们最常写的 Widget 并不是真正的 View 实例，它需要转化为对应的 RenderObject  才能绘制，而 Element 是 Widget 和 RenderObject 关键的中间实例，我们日常 Flutter 开发里用到的 BuildContext 就是 Element 的抽象对象。
也就是大致 Widget -> Element -> RenderObject 这样的过程。
所以在 Flutter 里 Widget 代码只是“配置文件”的作用，真正工作的实例是它内部对应的 Element 和 Re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ansible 是一个开源的自动化工具，可以以多种方式使用。以下是几个去年最受欢迎的 Ansible 教程和故事。




自动化不断改善着 IT 团队中每个人的生活。Ansible 可以帮助任何使用 IT 自动化的人，不管是为了保持文件的有序性还是配置打印机，或者是为了任何其他可以想象和构建的东西。这些是 2021 年我们分享的一些最引人注目的使用案例和经验。

无论你是第一次听说 Ansible，还是一个经验丰富的用户，这些文章都会有你的收获。


Ansible 的创始人 Michael DeHaan 分享了他对自己如何被引向 IT 自动化的想法。这篇访谈对 Ansible 是如何诞生的 以及随着时间的推移而发展的信息和见解都非常好。

当你作为一个系统管理员可以将许多日常任务自动化时，自动化可以节省一天的时间。了解如何使用 Ansible 为 五个日常的系统管理员任务 实现自动化流程。

你的下载文件夹中充满了垃圾吗？介绍一个简单的方法，用一个简单的剧本来清理你系统上的文件。它很容易扩展，计划好后，就会按照你的要求频繁运行。了解更多关于 用 Ansible 删除文件。

如果你正在 写 Ansible 剧本，可以用四行代码改善它们。想想下一个用户，特别是当你在一个项目上合作的时候。一个小的努力可以防止大的问题。

Ansible 社区已经采取了措施，通过审查其代码库和更新语言，使该项目更具包容性。请看 Ansible 术语变化 的总结。

从你的 Ansible 剧本中调用 API，就像一个专业人员一样！找出每个人都应该知道的关于 利用剧本中的 REST API。

有一些应该每天、每周或每月运行的计划任务？使用 Ansible 和 anacron 来设置任务，利用时间戳而不是计划时间，所以即使你的机器在计划时间关闭，它也会在重新开启时运行。

如果你刚刚开始使用 Ansible，也许你需要一些方向来开始。这里有 每个人都可以使用 Ansible 的 10 种方法。

当社区一起工作时，奇迹就会发生。这不仅仅是代码：了解 Ansible 如何构建设计系统，创建可重用的品牌资产以供社区使用。如果你是设计师或社区经理，你会特别欣赏这个故事。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你曾经尝试过使用 Arch Linux，你就知道如果没有适当的文档和 Linux 知识，几乎不可能安装它。而实际上，这就是 Arch Linux 的 魅力。

但由于 Arch Linux 属于专业级的 Linux 发行版，因此有几个 基于 Arch 的发行版，它们试图让普通人可以更轻松地使用它们。

当谈到 “基于 Arch 的 Arch 替代品” 时，Manjaro 和 EndeavourOS 是两个最受欢迎的选择。

所以让我们来看看这两个的区别。为什么你要选择其中一个而不是另一个？



桌面变体

这两个发行版都有多种桌面风格。Manjaro 有三种官方风格：Xfce、KDE 和 GNOME。此外还有社区版：Budgie、Cinnamon、Deepin、Mate、Sway 和 i3。

Endeavour OS 官方提供了更多的变体。除了 Manjaro 所拥有的那些，它还有 LXQT、BSPWM、Openbox 和 Qtile。

由于每种风格都有不同的 桌面环境（DE）及特定于该桌面的捆绑应用程序。这就导致了没有一个“严格”的最低系统要求基线。

根据 EndeavourOS 的网站，下面是每种桌面环境对内存的系统要求清单（对 Manjaro 也应该是一样的）：


Xfce - 至少 2GB 内存，但建议 4GB。

Mate - 至少 2GB 内存，但建议 4GB。

Cinnamon - 需要至少 4GB 的内存

Gnome - 至少需要 4GB 的内存（假设对 KDE 相同）

Budgie - 至少需要 4GB 的内存

Plasma - 至少需要 4GB 的内存

LXQT - 至少需要 2GB 的内存，但建议 4GB


获取 ISO

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I made a website to make us easily share links between our devices.
https://www.linkshared.io/
Many times when we found something interesting and wanted to share a link from one's phone or laptop to her desktop so we can both watch it on the big screen, we had to send the link by email, or sent to her phone via some app and she had to copy the link from her phone to the PC, Or we have to download some apps, etc.. The process was really annoying.
Therefore, we decided to make a website that can allow people share link by simply visit our webpage.
This webpage will hold the shared link for 2 minutes, for now, and people can share the link via a share code so other people can access the shared text.
Steps are very simple:
Share your text on the website.
Use the share code to get your text on other devices. If the text contains a URL, website will detect it and extract the link for you.
We used NextJS to implement both the frontend and backend API.
We opened a free Redislabs account so we can host our cache.
We used the free hosting service provide by Vercel.
We brought a domain name on Vercel for $70/yr.
We don't want to make a cloud storage.
We don't want to pay for a cloud storage.
In most use cases, this webpage just works like clipboard, so no long term storage is needed.
We don't want to pay for a cloud storage.

Clipboards across different operating systems work essentially the same. For this reason, we will stick to looking at a single one -- Windows.
A common misconception about how clipboards work is that they contain a single piece of data, such as text or an image. In reality, clipboards hold all the ways target software can represent the data.
Consider if I copy the following webpage:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel 6. nesil işlemcilerin (Skylake) entegre ekran kartlarında "Screen Flickering" adı verilen ekranda hafif bir titreme sorunu bulunmakta. 
Bu sorunu gidermenin en önemli yollarından birisi X11 üzerinde ekran kartı ayarlarının düzenlenmesi olarak görülmekte.
Sisteminizde yetkili kullanıcı olarak /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf dosyası oluşturup içeriğini aşağıdaki gibi yapabilirsiniz.
Section "Device"
    Identifier "Intel Graphics"
    Driver "intel"
    Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
    Option "TearFree" "true"
    Option "DRI" "3"

Daha sonrasında X11 servisini yeniden başlatmak veya daha doğrusu olarak sistemi yeniden başlatmak gerekecektir.]]></summary>

What should you do with it? I'm going to walk you through an install with Windows 10. Then we'll talk about what to do with docker.
Before you even install and try to run docker, you should probably understand what it is. Docker is a light-weight way of running a program through containers and microservices. Monolith Server Architecture is a thing of the past because we traditionally hosted resources in one environment. This made it versatile, but also heavy and very difficult to update changes. Microservices are used to split up tasks into specific operations. In the picture below, you can see all the small microservices one interface may be runn…]]></summary>

All UI in Comet is a View, which makes things really simple, right? Other toolkits may split them into controls, layouts, components, widgets, etc. That makes sense since some are best used for containing and organizing, others best for accepting user input, and others for creating beautiful UI. 
Let's take a tour of what's available today in Comet and how you can quickly start composing your UI.
The layouts in Comet extend from ContainerView which itself is a View. These managed views arrange and space child views on the screen, and all adapt to whatever size and density the app runs on. The current layout views include:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to CSS and HTML, application state falls into these categories:
cascade state: classes/checkbox state/other dom

pseudo state: based on current user interaction

animation state: pre-determined series, triggered by cascade and/or pseudo state

transition state: easing between the cascade and/or pseudo states when they change

These are the building blocks for all UX that can be combined in an infinite number of ways[1]. These are all intertwined of course, and we can split hairs on how I've referred to them, but ultimately though; Either our state is static - derived from the current DOM, or it's temporary - derived from the user's current interaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post explains the difference between class_eval and instance_eval methods in Ruby. If you keep getting confused between them when reading or writing Ruby code, it should clarify things a little. 
Consider the Greeting class, which forms the basis of other examples.

class_eval evaluates the string or block in the context of the class, allowing you to reopen the class and define additional behavior on it.
Creating a method inside the block defines an instance method on the class. All Greeting instances can call greet.

This is the same as explicitly defining the greet method in the Greeting class. The above code is equivalent to:

Benefits
The first benefit of class_eval is that you can call it on a variable pointing to a class, allowing you to add behavior to a class dynamically.

Step 1:
Create A New Directory
Open terminal, make a new directory called “close-all-tabs” and open your favorite text editor.
mkdir close-all-tabs
In order for Chrome to load your plugin, the extension files need to be pointed to a folder on your computer. In this directory, you can add all of the files you need for your extension.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SQL - Structured Query Language
A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
Eg: SELECT * FROM Customers;

--> It will retrieve all records data from customer table.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
Most Important SQL Commands
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[移动端App架构Demo
项目地址：https://github.com/yeshu-cn/mock_app
通过分层和接口的架构设计，实现可以快速Mock,单元测试的APP实例。

功能
登录，注册。
发帖，帖子列表，评论。
帖子点赞和帖子收藏。
修改用户昵称和头像。
架构
三层结构：业务层，持久层，展示层。
本地实现业务逻辑。
使用内存来实现持久层。
ui:展示层，主要负责数据展示和用户交互。
domain:业务层，利用抽象的Repository和Service接口实现业务逻辑UseCase，UseCase作为Api接口提供给三方使用。
data:持久层具体实现。
di: 通过ServiceLocator简单实现依赖注入，达到控制反转。

domain层和data层中的代码，根据需求可能直接移动到服务端，就是常见到Server/Client模式。

思考
和朋友讨论时，他问我这架构里面UI数据的缓存代码怎么写，怎么做网络请求的优化？
写这个Demo出来目的是根据代码职责，理清代码所在层次和所属角色。
具体的缓存策略和网络请求的优化，这个属于业务的具体实现，它的实现方法有各种各样，不是架构关心的内容，架构关心的是你的UI缓存代码肯定不能放在Domain中，你的网络请求优化代码肯定不能在Repository中。]]></summary>

我有个海外版电视盒子，安装了影视类的应用来看剧，但看着看着就会出现看 10 秒卡 2 秒（出现一个加载的圈）。我不清楚到底是什么原因造成的，不同的剧都会出现这个问题，不同的 app 也都出现这个问题，而且由于我担心是无限路由器原因（盒子只能用无线网，路由器距离电视盒子也不远，并且没有墙），所以路由器也换过（固件也试过原装的和自己刷 openwrt ），仍然还是有这个问题，想请教是为什么？
顺便还想问一下有没有什么能刷 openwrt 的，信号好的路由器推荐？

    io.github.openfeign

公共传输类大致如下

feign 接口
@FeignClient("test.engine")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[导语

2020 年末，「推播助栏」回顾了 2020 年听过的众多中文播客，从中选出了 10  个值得追更的中文播客栏目，初衷是为了与播客平台的榜单相区分，不单单推荐单个播客，想更具体一点，分享这些中文播客的优质栏目。
今年「推播助栏」将会延续年度回顾的惯例，同时为了回应 2021 年涌现出的不少敢于尝试、制作成熟的叙事类中文播客，不再从播客子栏目切入，改为分享优秀的叙事类单集。
我从过去一年的当月分享中挑选了 10 集节目，并且新增了 2 集未推荐的节目，一共整理出了 12 集叙事类节目，其中 11 集为非虚构故事，1 集为虚构故事，涉及性别、疫情、巴以冲突、老龄化、躺平等主题。
以下单集节目按照时间的先后顺序进行排列，并附上了podlink链接，点击链接后你既可以在线播放节目，也可以选择常用的播客应用跳转播放，部分节目还附上了节目相关的文稿或采访报道，方便你进一步深入了解相关故事。
 

🌠 2021 年最佳敘事类单集

过刊︱EP20 原创播客剧《你们忘了那扇门》
一集精心制作的播客剧，主要讲述了两位记者候选人前往偏远山区采访拐卖传闻的故事。两位主播专门为故事创作两首歌《冬至》和《破晓》，一头一尾构成了叙事的一部分，故事也在结尾迎来了翻转。
录音质量很高，声音有明显的空间感，有符合人物动作行为必要的配音和配乐，几位参与者的整体表演也不错，末尾有种歌剧的感觉，在叙事的方式上还可以做得更好。

星期天晚上 Before Monday｜EP4 今年過年我想來點不同的：除夕可以在娘家過嗎？
唠得默默｜EP1 弦子与她的朋友们
这两集节目都是关于女性议题的，节目制作者不约而同地采取了storytelling的方式，采访多位话题相关者和事件亲历者，结合收集到的现场录音和恰当的配乐，以尽可能多元的角度去呈现事件的全貌，对于性别话题的公共讨论非常有价值。

扣减积分发生在会员服务中，创建订单及修改订单状态为已支付发生在商城服务中，所以会出现“扣减了积分，但是没有成功创建订单”这种情况。

我是 GPON 本以为正常是升级 XG PON ，谁知道电信不按常理出牌，给我换了个 10G EPON ，也不知道电信咋想的，估计这个 10G EPON 只有我一家用。光率也从-24 到了-15 。
今儿换完后还是没弄利索，直接沿用原来的 LOID ，拨号后网速只有 100M ，明儿电信线路员接着来我家弄。
PS：其实我的真实意图是跟电信砍砍价，把资费给我降个三五十块就行，因为就这点破事拖了近两个月时间，我也拖够了，再有就是下行对我来说也无所的，多 200M 300M 和少 200M 300M 也没啥分别，下行带宽本来就是不值钱的东西。谁成想电信就是不跟我提用降低资费的解决这茬，最后还真给我换了。]]></summary>

在 android 学习中，学习 activity 返回获取结果，有这样的代码
override fun onActivityResult(
        requestCode: Int,
        resultCode: Int,
        data: Intent?
    ) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
        when (requestCode) {
            1 -> if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                val returnedData = data?.getStringExtra("data_return")
                Log.d("FirstActivity", "returned data is $returnedData")
            }
        }
    }

在 result = RESULT_OK 中，RESULT_OK 是定义在 android.app.activity ，且为 public static final 修饰。
我自定义类为 FirstActivity （也是重写的 onActivityResult 所在的类），继承自 AppCompatActivity ，而 AppCompatActivity 是从 android.app.activity 一路继承下来的，那我的理解就是我自己定义的 FirstActivity 也有 RESULT_OK 这个常量。那么按理来说应该这个语句可以写为：
result = AppCompatActivity.RESULT_OK
或
result = FirstActivity.RESULT_OK
但是实际上只有result = AppCompatActivity.RESULT_OK不报错（但是会显示为灰色，估计意思是写 AppCompatActivity 是多余的），而result = FirstActivity.RESULT_OK报错
就想问 FirstActivity 应该也继承了 RESULT_OK ，为什么会报错呢

#使用 PLesk+litespeed 加速你的 wordpress 博客
##1.基础配置
linux 服务器一台
PLesk 管理面板
litespeed web 服务器
​      litespeed 和 redis 配合 LScache 缓存插件可以实现 wordpress 内容的快速缓存，而且可以通过 PLesk 面板管理 litespeed 服务器，对新手有更友好，而且安全可靠
##2.控制面板 Plesk
###2.1 系统需求
请确认你的服务器系统是不是 Plesk 所要求的！截止到我写完这篇文章为止，最新版的 debian11 还没有被支持
下图是 Plesk obsidian 版本一键脚本支持的系统，具体需求见(Software Requirements for Plesk Obsidian)
2.2 安装 Plesk
由于 PLesk 官方提供一键安装脚本，所以我们很轻松地就可以安装 Plesk （注意必须是干净的系统）
sh 
安装成功后 root 界面输入“plesk”命令会有如下回显

默认会安装
MariaDB
PHP7.3 和 PHP7.4（扩展基本上都装好了）
Apache 和 nginx web 服务器
想安装其他东西的话可以自己去 plesk installer 安装
##3 设置 plesk
访问   https://你的 ip  你会看到 PLesk 的登陆界面 ，使用服务器 root 和密码登录后，这里提示会让你激活 plesk 需要 key 输入即可
Tips:关于 PLesk 的 key 可以去良心云的云市场看看，他们一般都会提供免费的 PLesk one 的 key ，实际也够用了
4.更换 web 服务器为 litespeed
4.1 更换条件
根据 litespeed 的政策：需要更换为 litespeed…]]></summary>

->
I subscribe a newspaper or I subscribe a 

那在 Rx 的概念里，newspaper company 有数据（也就是每日晨报）要发送，是一个可订阅或者说可 Observe 的东西，所以应该是 Observable 的一个实例）。
而『我』抽象出来的话应该是一个 Observer 类型（具有订阅的能力，并且在获得到订阅的东西后有一些行为）
所以写成代码后应该是 I.subscribe(newspaperCompany)
然而
interface Observable {
    Subscription subscribe( Observer s )
}
所以 RxJava 里应该写成 newspaperCompany.subscribe(I)
就让我非常难顶。
实在不行，这个方法名能不能从 subscribe 改成 register 啊，
newspaperCompany.register(I)  --> 报纸发行商把订阅报纸的我注册在要发每日晨报的名单里了  我一下子就觉得好理解和舒服得多
这里为什么这么设计呢？

在我们自己做的一些副业产品中，常常需要对一些业务场景进行滑动验证码的接入，例如：登录注册、抢购秒杀、发帖风控 等，但前期我们针对目前已存在的产品调研了很久，发现了他们存在许多的问题，其中包括：
recaptcha 即使替换了域名，也会有部分用户反馈无法使用
vaptcha 需要绘制曲线，门槛太高，大部分用户不了解如何使用
极验 /腾讯防水墙 /网易云盾等免费版各种使用限制，很难愉快使用
极验 /腾讯防水墙 /网易云盾等高级版年收费很高，没有按量付费
极验 /网易云盾等不提供多维数据，仅有通过与否一个字段供接入方判断
......
同时我们看到 V2EX 上偶尔会有人寻求相关的产品，因此我们就着手做了一整套验证码服务 - 友验。
那么 友验 和其他产品有哪些不同呢？
按月重置的免费额度 + 按量付费（免费版每月 5W 免费验证额度）
基于风险评分体系，我们提供包括 检测得分、IP 风险、设备指纹 等多个维度数据
编写了包含微信小程序 /PC/H5/iOS/Android...等 SDK 方便你快速接入 
我们从零使用 JavaScript 编写了 JavaScript 编译和解释器用于 VMP ，并且部分开源提供大家使用 
使用公开的浏览器特征和 DOM 规范数据用来训练特征模型，用来识别 puppeteer/selenium/playwright 等 Headless 的伪装 
目前友验已稳定运行，帮助 12 家小公司和 39 名个人开发者抵御了每天总 6 百万次的请求。如果有被薅羊毛、恶意灌水、恶意注册、恶意爬虫所困扰的朋友不妨尝试使用一下 友验 。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[认真生活的人，从来不会被辜负。

大家好，我带着这款有些不一样的日记 App「你的一天」和大家见面了。开发这款 App 的最初想法是，可以用模块化、流水账的形式，记录每个一天的普普通通的生活。也是在用它帮助和督促自己认真对待生活、记录生活。
普通而又独特的「日记」

早上起来，大雨。
心情很糟，今天是周一，还要去上班，又要把鞋子弄得湿漉漉了。
公司的午餐好好吃，天气也放晴了，好开心。

像上面的这段简单的日记一样，每天的心情、地点、天气都是随时间变化的，我特别希望能够随时、随手记录这样的变化，这也是我希望做到的，记录和观察生活的方式。
所以，「你的一天」来了。
图片由「你的一天」生成
像上面一样，可以分别使用文字、图片、声音、位置、天气、心情六种基础模块，帮助你构筑每一个专属于自己的普通而又独特的一天。
日记使用小技巧
接下来，我来悄悄的告诉你一些使用「你的一天」记录日记的小技巧，帮助你更好地使用它。
日记元素排序
每一个日记元素都支持长按拖拽排序，你可以任意组织它们的顺序，甚至还支持跨天移动。
iPad 拖拽添加照片
如果这时候，你的手中恰巧还有一台 iPad，还可以直接拖拽照片进来，拖拽文字也是可以的。这项功能在 iPhone 上也是可以使用的，不过在 iPad 上，使用起来会更加方便。
最棒的是，你不必担心 iPhone 和 iPad 的数据同步，我们使用 iCloud 帮你把所有数据管理起来，这从你第一次打开 App 的时候，就是默认支持的了，不用担心数据的遗失。
筛选记录
如果你已经使用它很长时间了，那么一些有特殊意义的记录，你可以把它标记为喜欢，也可以为它们添加标签。接下来，筛选功能可以帮助你找到曾经喜欢过的记录，同时支持按照喜欢、范围、类型、标签等方式筛选。
爱上物品「收纳」
这是一款关心你生活的 App，而在生活中，第一件事就是将自己的房间、办公室和物品整理…]]></summary>

搅拌机：剁什么剁，这玩意儿不好使吗？
@jijiali：对于一个生活在北方的人来讲，饺子是最普通不过的一种食物。这不仅体现在日常中的三天两头吃饺子，饯行时的「上马馉饳（ɡǔ duo）下马面」，更体现在逢节就是饺子。如此多的场景之下，饺子馅几乎就得天天准备。
作为一个一把菜刀打天下的人，在准备饺子馅儿的时候，我通常办法就是先把肉切成薄片，再把薄片切成肉条，随后把肉条切成小肉里，然后剁成肉馅。蔬菜也是类似的处理之法。最后把它们混合在一起。但是时间久了，也是感到剁个饺子馅太累；尤其是过年，三十晚上与初一连着两顿的饺子。所以，每当遇到饺子（包括馄饨）的时候，就特别的需要一个能代劳的设备。于是乎就有了接下来的这样几种搅拌设备。
手动搅拌器

这种塑料款的搅拌器在地摊上、网络上很常见。纯手工、不需要额外电力、节能环保，美中不足的是有时候需要大力出奇迹。使用时需要用手按住边缘，防止机器默走。整体来讲，少量的蔬菜、肉类还是可以的。当然食材需要预处理一下。
把这款手动搅拌器小型化，把摇把换成拉绳，这样就得到了一个压蒜器。相对来说，这款小机器把大蒜、辣椒或者其他佐料打成蓉状还是比较方便的。
搅拌器升级版——博朗 MQ525（600 瓦）

相对于前面的手动版，勃朗手持式搅拌器由于有电驱动，自然功率会提升了不少。机器两档可调。我最初买这款机器…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如今,智能家居给我们的生活带来了很多便利，对我来说完全是不用不知道，一用回不去的产品，不少家电的操控我现在都是用嘴完成或者是设置条件自动化执行的。目前自己米家APP、Homeassistant同时都在使用，Homeassistant主要用来弥补米家的一些不足，也避免自己被米家生态困住。但是根据网上的不少案例发现Homeassistant下要实现语音控制，似乎非常麻烦，除了要安置一台诸如天猫精灵之类的接入设备，后台的设置也不简单，于是我一番摸索之后想到用手机自带的语音助手实现操控Homeassistant来执行动作。这么一来只需要一台旧手机（无论什么品牌，甚至没有自带语音助手都行）作为语音接入，甚至连天猫精灵、小米蓝牙音箱都省了。但是，需要通过语音助手实现的每一条动作，我都必须单独创建一条自动化。
工作原理
需要的工具：

一部旧手机/平板。
FV悬浮球APP（免费）  或者  通知滤盒APP（付费）
一台安装了Homeassistant的设备。（只要你会折腾甚至连Homeassistant也可以一同装在旧手机中）

执行步骤：

Homeassistant中预先创建自动化，触发条件设置为webhook
手机通过语音助手识别我的语音命令
根据我的语音命令创建一条通知
通过FV悬浮球的自动任务（或者通知滤盒）获取该通知
通过FV悬浮球的自动任务（或者通知滤盒）根据通知内容发送对应http请求到Homeassistant
Homeassistant收到发送的请求，并执行对应自动化。

如果你是用的是IOS设备，那只需要用Homeassistant安装Home Bridge 插件，就能接入 HomeKit用siri来控制智能家居了。另外IOS的捷径可以直接进行SSH连接安装了Homeassistant的设备执行shell命令。通过shell命令，不仅可以实现远程唤醒/关机之类的操作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[flomo 是新一代 「卡片笔记」 ，专注在碎片化时代，促进你的记录，帮你积累更多知识资产。
而作为一个功能，flomo 为用户提供了在微信侧的快速录入的能力。但受限于飞书的审核问题，flomo 一直没有提供飞书的接入，我们始终无法使用飞书来完成 flomo 的记录，接下来，我们一起动手自己写一个 flomo 机器人来完成类似微信的功能。
基本信息
本教程需要使用飞书账号、轻服务账号以及 flomo Pro 的权限，请先自行注册相应的账号。
获取 flomo API 地址
在飞书当中接入 Flomo，需要你已经开通 Flomo Pro，使用 Flomo Pro 提供的 API 来实现。因此，你需要访问 Flomo 的 「API 及第三方工具」页面，复制你的 API 链接，并留存下来，我们稍后会用到。
 
创建飞书机器人
首先，打开飞书开放平台，使用你的飞书账号登陆，点击首页的「创建应用」，进入到应用的创建页面，创建一个新的「企业自建应用」。

创建完成后，点击你创建好的 Flomo Pro 应用，进入应用详情，找到左侧菜单的「凭证与基础」，找到你的 App ID 和 App Secret，将这两个值记录下来，后续会用到。
此外，打开左侧菜单中的「事件订阅」，找到 Verification Token ，将这个值记录下来，后续会用到。

此外，你还需要点击左侧 Tab 中「应用功能」中的「机器人」页面，开启机器人功能。
创建轻服务应用
打开轻服务网站，登陆管理控制台

创建一个新的服务，这里需要选择 Node.js 应用来进行创建。创建完成后，进入到服务内部。
在服务内部点击左侧的「设置」，进入到设置页面，在设置页面中找到「小程序设置」，配置其中的「飞书小程序/机器人」，将刚刚保存的 App ID 、App Secret 填写到这里并保存。

编写代码，安装依赖，并上线函数
复制代码
打开代码页面，复制代码，并在你自己的云函数界面创建同名文件，粘贴对应的内容。

安装依赖
粘贴代码后，点击左下角 「NPM 管理」中输入框右侧的搜索按钮，在弹出的搜索框中输入 axios ，安装 axios 依赖。

配置环境变量
安装完成后,点击右上角配置框中的环境变量，填入VERIFICATION_TOKEN 和 FLOMO_API 以及对应的值：

VERIFICATION_TOKEN：飞书开放平台中，「事件订阅」tab 中的 Verification Token。
FLOMO_API：flomo 的 api ，可以从这里获取

上线函数
完成上述的代码配置、依赖安装以及环境变量配置后，接下来需要对函数进行上线操作。点击上方的函数上线按钮，即可将当前函数执行上线。
上线完成后，你会获得一个函数的调用地址，复制这个调用地址。

配置飞书机器人权限和 API 地址
配置 API 地址
完成了函数上线之后，接下来我们到飞书开放平台进行配置。
找到你刚刚创建的飞书应用，点击左侧边栏中的「事件订阅」，在事件订阅页面配置请求网址，在请求网址中粘贴刚刚复制的函数调用地址。

配置事件并申请权限
配置好请求网址 URL 后，点击下方的添加事件，在其中选择「接受消息 v2.0」

添加事件后，会自动提醒你需要申请相应的权限， 点击权限名称即可在弹出的窗口中申请权限。这里需要申请「读取用户发给机器人的单聊消息」和「获取用户在群聊中@机器人的消息」两个权限。
此外，你还需要在权限管理中申请「以应用的身份发消息」这个权限。
提交审核并发布机器人
完成各项配置后，点击左侧 Tab 中的「版本管理与发布」，并创建一个新的版本，填写各项基本信息。
需要注意的是，因为我们在这里没有添加鉴权的部分，所以需要设定可见权限为你自己，避免被其他人录入奇怪的信息。

完成填写后，「保存」并「申请发布」，等待审核通过后，你的机器人就可以在飞书当中使用啦～

在飞书上测试机器人
当你的飞书机器人发布成功后，接下来你就可以给 Flomo 机器人发消息了，比如，发个 #轻服务 Hi,你好，轻服务 试试看吧？

2020 年 4 月，一个名为“这个网站会自毁”的网站悄悄上线了。它的自毁可以被网友们拯救：“你可以向我发送信息。如果 24 小时内我没有收到信息，将会永久自毁。”不过快两年过去了，它依然活着。这个网站上有各种各样的留言，你留言之后不但可以给这个网站续命，而且可以随机看到一条别人的留言。


老王点评：很有趣的一个社会实验，或许这个网站自毁的一天就是人类对自己已经失望的一天吧。




Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 计划坚守 Linux 内核 5.15

昨天我们发的 文章 中预测 Ubuntu 22.04 中可能会使用 Linux 内核 5.17。但是在关于 Ubuntu 22.04 的 GNOME 计划的讨论中，Canonical 提到 “计划是在 LTS 中使用 5.15，但是 OEM 和 HWE 版本将在某个时候升级到 5.17”。也就是说，在 2023 年，Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 将使用 Ubuntu 22.10 的 HWE 内核，而 Ubuntu 的 OEM 合作伙伴，如戴尔也能够为他们最新的 Linux 预装系统提供更新的内核。之所以采用 5.15，是因为这个版本也是 LTS 的，虽然已经发布了半年了。


老王点评：LTS 发行版采用 LTS 内核是应有之义，至于最新硬件支持，这个其实对于 LTS 版本来说并不是最关键的。




PCIe 6.0 规范发布，但 PCIe 4.0 才只有 10% 的份额

AMD 在 2019 年的锐龙 3000 系列处理器上首发了 PCIe 4.0 技术，现在各大 SSD 厂商也都有 PCIe 4.0 旗舰级硬盘上市。在 2020 年的时候，SATA SSD 硬盘份额超过了 1/3，PCIe 4.0 只占 3% 份额，2021 年才提高到了 10%，今年的普及速度还会加快，但份额预计只有 30% 左右。PCIe 5.0 硬盘的速度可从目前的 7GB/s 提升到 14GB/s，性能轻松翻倍。而 PCI-SIG 组织刚刚 发布 了 PCIe 6.0 标准，速度再次翻倍到 64GT/s，PCIe x16 可以提供高达 256GB/s 的带宽，用于 SSD 的话 PCIe 6.0 x4 可提供最高 32GB/s 的速度。


老王点评：硬件的发展真是日新月异，感觉没多久就淘汰了。]]></summary>

「2022 年什么会火？什么该学？本文正在参与“聊聊 2022 技术趋势”征文活动 」
什么是“好”的技术，为什么“火”
前言：这个是个人观点，技术要用在合适的业务场景中才能体现出它的优势，而不是盲目的去学，去看
解决现今开发的技术痛点
协程
回调地狱，切换线程等功能
a()//耗时任务

b()

当两个方法a，b执行的代码块没有依赖关系时，执行耗时任务采用异步的方式来解决，通过开线程或者通过handler post一个Runnable来执行a方法这个耗时操作，b不需要等待a结束就可以直接运行。
但是如果a和b是有依赖关系的，b方法需要用到a方法返回的数据进行处理，但是又为了不影响b之后的代码阻塞，所以会在a方法中传入一个回调，等到a方法执行完后回调接口，在回调方法里面在执行b方法
如果业务的依赖关系非常复杂，就会陷入到回调地狱中，这种方式一是不够优雅，二是代码不够直观（逻辑太过复杂）
相对来说：
协程在这方面比较“优雅”；切换线程也只需一行withContext（）;代码更加直观（森有体会，以前都是点到这然后点那，点的点的发现晕了，歇菜【自己进行时序图整理】）
插一句，这些功能并不是协程特有的，其他工具或者自己造轮子都可以实现。但是技术的功能性虽然很重要，但是其平台型和天然原生的api也是必不可少的（这部分后面在讲技术生态的时候讨论）。
插件化
这项技术虽然已经不怎么“新”了，大家也都知道了它的优势和解决的痛点：
1.动态更新app
(是整个APP都更新，不是热修复那种补丁包单独修改某个问题。实现方法目前是云端存放最新的插件apk，每次进行检测版本号等观察是否需要更新，当然保证apk的安全性也是必要的，可通过一些加密解密来保证)
2.减少包体积

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

板绘新手大部分是看了动漫，或看到哪位大大画的成品图，因为想学而了解到的数位板、数位屏。那么，什么是数位板？如何选择一款适合自己的数位板？数位板和数位屏选哪个好？诸多问题常常让新手不知所措。这篇文章，我将为板绘初学者答疑解惑。
初识数位板
数位板，又名绘图板、绘画板、手绘板、手写板等，是连接电脑、手机、平板的一种输入设备，由一块板子、一支有压感的笔和一根线组成，主要用于数字绘画、写字、标注等。我们常在网络上看到的插画、漫画、动漫等，就是艺术家使用数位板或其它设备绘画而出。

最重要的先说完：两个最直接的感官体验
尺寸方面，需要根据自己的书桌/电脑桌子的大小，以及自己手的大小来选择适合自己的数位板。
手感方面，数位板表面的画感，就是那层「膜」——有粗有细，喜欢素描纸的那种粗糙感，可以买粗一点，但粗糙的同时，笔芯也磨损的快。相反，喜欢铜版纸的那种光滑感，可以买细点，笔芯也相对画的久些。再者就是笔的手感，有软笔和硬笔之分，习惯画水彩或者平时画画或写字都不喜欢使劲的，建议买软笔手感，行程长，笔的压感容易得到释放。如果平时写字画画都比较用力，建议买硬笔，行程短，不容易压坏笔的同时，手感也更舒适。

解读数位板详细参数
读取速率
读取速率也叫读取速度（单位：英文 PPS，中文是点/秒），目前常见的有 133、200、233、266、300 这几个配置可选，一般越高越好，这个参数影响到你画线跟不跟笔，一般 200 以上肉眼就很难看出有延迟情况，但也要看电脑的配置，配置不好，数位板的读取速率在高，也还是会延迟。（目前达到 300PPS 的数位板是绘…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在你学习 Linux 命令行或练习新的编程语言时，请随身携带这些方便的备忘单。




你不可能记住每一个你需要使用的命令或快捷方式。我们都是普通人，通常情况下，我把笔记放在不同的纸片上和笔记本里。这导致我的办公桌上有些过分紊乱。到处都是一些五年前的杂乱无章的潦草文字。这这些 2021 年的备忘单将把混乱降低一个档次。从 JavaScript 到 Linux，这个列表中都有适合你的东西。

如何编写你的第一段 JavaScript 代码

这篇 文章 是为那些今年想尝试学习一门新语言的初来乍到者准备的。Seth Kenlon 介绍了如何安装 JavaScript 和开始制作一个简单的 HTML 页面。虽然 Seth 解释说 JavaScript 并不只用于网站，但所有主要的网页浏览器都有一个运行你的代码的 JavaScript 引擎。在整个演练过程中，Seth 涵盖了语法、变量和函数，让你开始创建一个新的应用。最后，在分享 备忘录 之前，Seth 还介绍了用 JavaScript 进行跨平台的能力。

Linux 软件包管理

在 Chris Hermanse 的 文章 中，在他分享他的 备忘录 之前，我们对使用 apt 做了简要预览。许多人日常在家里和办公室使用基于 Debian 的 Linux。在这篇入门文章中，我们可以了解一下 apt 的用途，首先是用 apt 在软件包系统中寻找软件，也可以用另一个命令查看这些软件包的元数据。接下来，Chris 介绍了查看一个软件包是否包括安装过程中需要的文件（软件包依赖）。最后，Chris 介绍了如何用 apt 命令删除软件包。这份详尽的备忘录可以给你带来比 Linux 的日常软件包管理更多的东西。如果 apt 不适合你，你也可以看看 dnf 备忘录。

用 DOS conio 开始编程

你是否想在明年涉足 DOS？如果是的话，你已经准备好创建令人兴奋的新应用，Jim Hall 为你准备了一份 备忘录。在这篇 文章 中定义了 conio，在分享备忘录之前，Jim 介绍了如何制作你自己的彩色文本用户界面。Jim 解释说，你可以用你的应用做更多的事情，使其更具互动性和刺激性。现在你有了这个备忘录，你就可以用 DOS conio 创建你自己的应用了。

学习 SQLite3

与这种常见的数据库一起工作？下面是你如何通过这个 备忘录 成为一个资深用户。在这个 实践教程 中，Klaatu 从安装和与 SQLite3 互动开始，然后在分享备忘录之前创建了一个带表的数据库。Klaatu 还用一段很简单的文字解释了数据类型和日期时间戳功能。Klaatu 在本教程中增加了更多详细的功能，包括查看表格、改变表格等等。如果你想继续使用 SQLite3 数据库并使其变得强大，或者只是想学习如何使用它，这个备忘录就适合你。

更多的 Linux 备忘录

虽然我只是蜻蜓点水地提及了这些备忘单，但我想提到一些值得称赞的地方，其中包括 Seth Kenlon 的 Linux 备忘单：


Seth 对 grep 的高级用法对各种场合都很有用。

find 命令备忘录对于我不想花大量时间在目录中徘徊的时候特别有帮助。

出于行业视野的局限，能写长文的话题少的不行；干的不是财务所以年前没活儿（不是），只能不断地在一亩三分地挖坑。作者喜闻乐见的两个话题，艺术和教育，一个源于生活，高于生活1，另一个干脆就是生活2，四舍五入少数派生活区得有我一把椅子。
近期为了朋友的婚礼，准备了一场相当用心的演出（也就是封面），得到的反馈是“和平时认为的魔术表演不太一样”。所以原本想写的其实是关于教育的文章，但趁着还有灵感，抓紧写（水）一篇稿子。
哦对，我依旧是老麦的颜粉，咱们开始：

一、雅俗共赏的艺术创作 —— 不只是 “脱了裤子唱昆曲”
郭老师认为真正的艺术就是雅俗共赏，这个答案靠谱。回想刘谦老师09年春晚的演出，靠的也是橡皮筋儿、鸡蛋、戒指和董卿老师（没有）成功地出圈，而这些与生活息息相关的魔术物件，其实很大程度上把魔术变得合理3，从而成就了 “令人印象深刻的魔术”。

“雅要雅得那么俗，俗要俗的那么雅。” —— 郭德纲

这就如吾独钟爱王建国老师的段子，尽管大家都记住了活该扣钱的、残pè的谐音梗，但让人记忆深刻的还是一些有深度的内容；有些不需要动脑子也能大笑出声的 “俗套” 段子，更有的是许多值得一些个，所谓“风雅”之士玩味的好东西。
如题
或许所谓雅俗共赏，“俗” 一字所探讨的不是外生殖器或者固液气三态排泄物这种等级的“三俗”，而是关于艺术创作引起观众共鸣的门槛，到底有多高，或者说金色大厅的演出，究竟有没有街边两条狗打架好看？这个门槛之于电影、音乐、美术而言非常清晰，尤其是如今短平快，流量为王的时代，你的观点或创作简单易懂的程度，作者认为正是其中一个门槛。
著名弹幕网站对于《让子弹飞》申遗的事儿，想必关注互联网的人都明白，作者认为这部电影 “俗” 到头了。看这部片子不需要所谓知识储备和艺术底蕴，平铺直叙的段子（如：来者不善，你才是来者）笑得我这个没什么文化的人把大腿拍烂，讲茶…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[盘点那些具有特色的写作软件
在软件市场，拥有很多各具特色的编辑器。在最近两年，随着 Notion 和 Roam Research 等工具的发展，原本已经拥挤的笔记软件赛道又出现了不少新的笔记软件。
与笔记软件相比，写作软件相对来说少很多。尽管如此，写作软件市场已经不少拥有特色的写作工具。今天，我尝试在有限的视野范围内对已发现的一些拥有特色的写作软件进行逐一盘点。
在正文开始之前，有几点需要说明：

文章中出现的写作软件，只是作为某个类别的写作软件代表进行介绍。具体使用体验，最好还是请用户自行判断。
文章中选择的写作软件具有一定的主观性，同时也存在挂一漏万的情形。有不足之处，请留言补充。
理论上，对于一款编辑器而言，既可以记笔记，也可以进行创作。但是，笔记记录和内容创作等使用场景对于编辑器的需求并不一样。因此，对于一些没有自我定位为写作软件的编辑器，并不在筛选范围内。所以，对于编辑体验很棒的 Typora 等 Markdown 编辑器不会加以罗列。同理，尽管 Roam Research、Obsidian 等双链笔记其实非常适合作为写作软件，本文也不会涉及。

干扰？诱惑？那些聚焦写作任务的写作软件
早期的写作软件，主要是从优化写作体验的角度出发为写作提供辅助。比如，支持 Markdown 语法进行输入，这如今成为绝大多数写作软件的标准配置。在 Markdown 编辑的基础上，逐渐衍生出一些辅助用户聚焦写作任务的功能。
无干扰模式
无干扰模式的早期代表为 iA Writer ，主要是在干净、清爽的写作环境基础上，以降低上下文干扰为目的的内容聚焦功能。 随后，Ulysses 强化了无干扰模式，支持以段落、行、句子为单位的多种形式的内容聚焦，并且辅以页面自动滚动功能。
这些无干扰模式本质上是通过对当前编辑内容的上下文进行淡化隐藏加以实现。尽管如此，这些上下文对于某些创作者而言依然是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tailwind CSS lets you leverage utility classes to build your own components. This means you can reference Tailwind CSS classes directly in HTML.
Yup, you heard that right. You no longer need to create your own CSS. This will save you plenty of development time, so you can focus on other parts of your project. 
To begin, create a new folder on your desktop and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
If you have Visual Studio Code, pull up the terminal. 

Then type in npm -v. This command is necessary to see which version of npm you are running. If you don't have it installed, you'll have an error message. If you didn't download npm, don't worry. It's pretty easy, just search for it on Google.

So let's create a better Thue! I made an episode about Thue(https://dev.to/taw/100-languages-speedrun-episode-43-thue-143i), so read that for some background.
Thue is a fun esoteric language, but suffers from two annoying issues:
newline handling requires special weird rules
a lot of nearly identical rules needed to be copied and pasted as there are no wildcard matches
I'll be using Crystal to code the interpreter(https://taw.hashnode.dev/100-languages-speedrun-episode-49-crystal).
Before I start adding new features, let's write a base interpreter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that JS is a single-threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language.
But what does this actually mean?
Let’s find out: 
Suppose we have a function that calls another function that calls one more function, such as:
function add(a,b) {
    return a+b;
}
function callAdd(a,b) {
    return add(a,b);
}
function finalFunc(a,b) {
    const addDigits = callAdd(a,b)
    console.log(addDigits);
}
finalFunc(3,4); // Output: 7

We all know that finalFunc will call callAdd, callAdd will call add, and add will return the sum of these two numbers and we will get 7. 
But what’s happening behind the scenes?

So, there is a thing called call stack in JavaScript which is a type of data structure that records basically where we are currently in our program. 
It looks something like this:

It's a pretty natural request; HTML is a nice display oriented format and has great layout and styling abilities. Plus, for a web app, I probably already have code written to produce the exact content I want. I just need to turn that content into a read-only, portable PDF for downloading or attaching to an email, without forcing the user to print to pdf manually.
I've used numerous technologies for doing that conversion, including WebSuperGoo's ABCpdf.net, and Rotativa's free library. (We even have an article on how to use it.) The latter is still in use on some of my projects, but it—and its newer .Net Core version—is based on wkhtmltopdf.exe, which is a problem. More about that lat…]]></summary>

The short of PageSpeed is that if you add it to your web server, you can configure it to optimize anything passing through it using techniques such as minification, format conversion, and even injecting scripts to lazy-load images. You can read more about what it does on the official site.
It sounded great in theory, but how properly install it with NGINX wasn't obvious. While Google does publish scripts to help with the installation, it requires a non-trivial depth of knowledge to do right. After struggling with it for many hours, I wrote a guide for personal future reference.

All the while, threat actors are continually improving their attack techniques. If there is a vulnerability to be found, it will be exploited.

Developers still have remaining concerns, most of which focus on release time. However, you should not need to compromise fast releases in favor of security.

Django, Django rest framework
React.js, Redux, TailwindCSS
JWT based user registration and login.
CRUD endpoints for recipes.
Like and bookmark feature.
Unit testing on the backend.
Documentation of the API using drf_spectacular which supports OAS3.
=> There are some things to be fixed on the frontend and other features will be added soon.




The frontend and backend are hosted separately on Netlify and Heroku respectively. 
https://mesob-recipe.netlify.app/
You can test the endpoints here: https://recipe-backend-api.herokuapp.com/
If you like the project, give it a star on GitHub.
Link to GitHub repo: 
Backend: https://github.com/earthcomfy/recipe-api


Frontend: https://github.com/earthcomfy/react-recipe-app



Note: If you guys would like to see a tutorial on how some of the features are done, especially on the integration of Django and React, let me know in the comments section down below. I'll make sure to write a detailed article about the topic.
Any suggestions and feedbacks are welcome.

查看控制台里崩溃和 Spin 报告都没有对应记录，只有在诊断报告里有对应的 diag 文件，对应的都是重启时的时间。

2020 年买的 13 寸 intel mbp ，芯片是 i5 ，现在通过 dell 的 D6000 雷电拓展坞拖一个 4k 屏在看视频的时候会有明显的卡顿；办公室还有另一个 2k 屏，如果通过拓展坞同时连接 2k+4k ，正常的网页浏览都会卡顿，请问这是因为 mbp 带不动还是拓展坞不适配的问题呢？（拓展坞通过 DP 线连接显示器）
如果我想用一个笔记本同时丝滑拖动两个 4k 屏，正常办公的情景下，是不是需要上最新款的 14 寸 mbp ，或者带独显直连的 win 本（比如 3060 幻 14 ）是否可以满足我的需要？
非常感谢🙏！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从静态页面到 JAM 栈，CMS 的历史就是开源和 Web 变迁的核心。




内容管理系统Content Management System（CMS）是一个多产的软件类别，其涵盖了所有创建和修改数字内容的应用程序。因此，CMS 的历史可以追溯到由 蒂姆-伯纳斯-李 在 1990 年建立的历史上的第一个网站也就不足为奇了，该网站是以基于互联网的超文本系统 HTML 为模型，只包含了文本和链接。



万维网（WWW）的雏形是静态网站，无需后端数据库即可提供内容。它们消耗的计算资源很少，所以加载速度很快 —— 因为没有数据库查询、没有模板渲染、也没有客户端-服务器请求的处理。鉴于那时很少有人经常“上网冲浪”，特别是与今天相比，Web 流量也很少。

当然，促进了这种互操作性都是开源软件。事实上，开源在 CMS 的演变中一直扮演着重要的角色。

CMS 的崛起

快进到九十年代中期，随着万维网的普及和网站对频繁更新的需求的增加 —— 这与它最初托管手册式的静态内容有所不同。这导致了大量的 CMS 产品的出现，如 FileNet、Vignette 的StoryBuilder、Documentum 和其他许多产品。这些都是专有的闭源产品，这在那个时期并不罕见。

然而，在 21 世纪初，开源的 CMS 替代品出现了，这包括 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla。WordPress 包含一个可扩展的插件架构，并提供了可用于建立网站的模板，而不要求用户具备 HTML 和 CSS 知识。WordPress CMS 软件安装在 Web 服务器上，通常与 MySQL 或 MariaDB 数据库（当然，两者都是开源的）配合。CMS 是开源的这一事实在一定程度上加速了向 WordPress 的重大转变。

即使在今天，仍有大约三分之一的网站是使用这些第一代内容…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[kkkkkkz: 1 发生：记得是初一，我就感觉到身边的一切都不真实了，感觉是脑子蒙上了一层纱，但是不影响正常生活和学习，但是这种感觉超级不爽
这种感觉一直是持续性的，只有在初一某一天早上刷牙的时候，突然清醒了，但是大概两分钟后，又恢复到了不真实状态，一直持续到现在（ 28 岁），从来没有清醒过
2 治疗：刚得到这种不真实感后，就跟不爽，就和爸妈吵闹，但是他们也不懂，看了镇上的医生，说身体没问题
后来爸妈请教了一些先生，搞了个土办法，让我吃了一只鸡，不放盐直接蒸熟，然后吃完，骨头放在老家的地里埋了，就完事。我全力配合，我不想继续被这种感觉笼罩，可是无济于事。
后来我继续说我很难受，我可能有病，家里就带我去了南京军区总医院（老爸当兵的时候去过），抽了血，查了脑电图，说啥都正常呀，我不知道是高兴还是难过，爸妈反正是高兴了
很多个夜里翻来覆去，想想自己能不能醒过来，还是受不了，也不想和爸妈说了，他们也尽力了
算了吧，就当这玩意儿是个朋友，没办法，既来之则安之，我不去想就是了，不把注意力放在当下我是不真实的这种感受上，如果一出生人就是这种感觉呢，我可能初一之前是非常心如明镜的感觉，超乎常人吧，初一后回归了而已，别放在心上了… 想方设法安慰自己，不然，不知道怎么过去
3 现在：就这样，十几年过去了，正常上大学，工作，有 2 次恋爱，见了家长，最后还是分手了… 就常人看来，我就是个正常人，没有啥不同的
没有人知道这个不真实感是什么，查了下资料，像是现实解体 /人格解体，但是这个可能是创伤导致，想了下我好像啥创伤也没有啊，解体会带来不真实感，但是解体的原因和其他症状，我好像都没有，只有一个不真实感
我一直认为这个问题还是生理问题，甚至上周去拔智齿，还想着会不会是智齿把神经搞不真实了，拔完了还是一样
有想过看心理医生，但是除了不真实感，没有其他心理创伤或者心结了，有车有房有工作，平平安安没有遇到特别不顺的事，有一点躺平，所以也没去看心理医生了
PS：不管有没有不真实感，做梦的时候，梦里的感觉都是一样的~ （苦笑）]]></summary>

飞书妙记是一款“音视频转文字”的效率工具，在会议、培训、访谈、课堂等不同场景，将你的音视频内容转录为搜索便捷、重点高亮、互动多样的智能文字笔记，帮助你高效整理会议纪要，完整沉淀培训内容，一键收录访谈全程，清晰记录课堂重点。

飞书妙记-智能会议纪要,快捷语音识别转文字,将会议交流沉淀为知识,一切皆可妙记!: https://www.feishu.cn/product/minutes

简而言之，飞书妙记是一款好用的『音视频转文字』的服务，免费。
同类的产品还有钉钉闪记、十行笔记，各自有各自的优势，选择妙记也主要是因为它内置在飞书里，免费用户也有 100G 空间可用。
在过去的数个月里，我开始高强度使用妙记来改善日常的学习生活。
我过去三个月的使用情况
妙记的使用场景？
现场直播 - 2021 秋季飞书未来无限大会: https://zhanglixing.feishu.cn/minutes/obcniz2wa167643bt6u541ym
以发布会的妙记为例
会议场景
妙记作为飞书这样一个企业级协作平台的子应用，主打的其实就是高效会议回顾。
开会时打开妙记，会后妙记会自动帮你完成音频转文字、识别不同的说话人，你还可以插入书签(也就是所谓的议程、结论)方便其他人快速跳转，关联材料链接让其他人更好地获取会议背景信息。
编辑好的妙记可以通过链接可以直接分享给未参会的同学，支持倍速、点赞、搜索、跳过空白片段，也支持评论和互动。
所有妙记文件还支持播客模式，通勤路上也可以听。
课程场景
不得不承认，现在以视频形式承载的课程越来越多。在阮一峰老师的历史文章里曾提到过人们喜欢视频学习的原因在于

人类学习效率最高的方式，不是"读书 + 思考"，而是"观察 + 模仿"。前者需要较长时间的注意力投入，后者只需要短时间注意力，更符合人类的天性。

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/828332"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[vtoex0000000002: 
RT ，
单臂路由 ：pppoe 拨号，dns ， 网关 ，地址 192.168.1.2
主路由: 提供 wifi ，地址 192.168.1.1
该模式下，重启 wan 口或重启单臂路由，导致 client 获取多个 v6 ，从而导致不能联网问题。
调试一天后，没找到解决办法。
昨晚，想能不能用旁路路由实现？
将 pppoe 拨号放到主路由上，其他不变。注意：单臂路由 lan 口配置网关 192.168.1.1 ，否则单臂路由无法联网。（再配置 lan6 ，dncpv6 client 获取 v6 ，做不做无所谓，如果单臂路由不需要 v6 地址）。
网络拓扑比较简单：
光猫-->lan 口-->n1 盒子
主路由：我用的是 hs8145x6 的光猫，直接用光猫的千兆网卡和 wifi 做主路由。
单臂路由 n1 ，刷 op ，network 如下：
config interface 'lan'
        option proto 'static'
        option netmask '255.255.255.0'
        option device 'eth0'
        option ip6ifaceid 'random'
        option ip6assign '64'
        option ipaddr '192.168.1.2'
        option gateway '192.168.1.1'

config device
        option name 'eth0'
        option mtu '1500'
        option mtu6 '1500'

config device
        option name 'vpn-client'

config interface 'lan6'
        option proto 'dhcpv6'
        option reqaddress 'try'
        option reqprefix 'auto'
        option device 'eth0'
        option ip6assign '64'
        option ip6ifaceid 'random'
        option peerdns '0'

dhcp

config dhcp 'lan'
        option interface 'lan'
        option ra_management '1'
        option start '100'
        option limit '150'
        option force '1'
        option leasetime '1d'
        list ra_flags 'none'

这样，v6 地址的获取是从主路由获取，v4 从单臂路由获取。
单臂路由和主路由负载均衡分布，有利于提升设备利用率，提升上网速率。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[广告过滤 DNS 服务 Adhole 宣布关停

Pi-hole 可以帮助用户过滤浏览器和流媒体服务中的广告，可被设置于 DNS 的前方。早在 2017 年，Adhole 从一个公共 VPS 上的小型单节点 Pi-hole 实例，发展成为一个全球性的多节点广告屏蔽 DNS 网络，在全球拥有了成千上万的并发用户。但这也导致需要更多的服务器资源和维护工作。并且，最近还因为 IP 地址变换和证书更换带来了稳定性问题。不堪重负之下，项目方 宣布关闭。


老王点评：这就是公益行为没有转换成可持续的非营利模式。有些可惜。




去年可利用的 WordPress 插件漏洞数量爆炸性增长

研究人员 发现，到 2021 年底，第三方 WordPress 插件中有 10359 个漏洞，其中 2240 个漏洞是在去年披露的，与 2020 年相比，漏洞数量增加了 142%。WordPress 插件的漏洞中，有 75% 可被远程利用，80% 存在公开利用，而可公开利用的漏洞中 60% 没有被 CVE 组织记录。平均而言，所有 WordPress 插件漏洞的 CVSSv2 得分是 5.5，属于中等风险。但研究发现，恶意行为者并不青睐那些严重性高的漏洞，而是选择那些他们容易利用的漏洞。


老王点评：超过 40% 网站使用 WordPress，因而其缺陷和风险也被相应放大，值得注意。




Linux 内核准备彻底移除 a.out 格式支持

直到 90 年代中期的 Linux 1.2 版本之前，Linux 都依靠 a.out 二进制文件格式，之后才改用了 ELF 二进制文件格式。但直到 2019 年，Linux 才废除了对在 x86 32 位上运行 a.out 的支持。现在，有人提交 了从内核中移除 a.out 支持的补丁，并得到了其它内核开发者的支持。在这个过程中，一些旧的系统调用和其他未使用的内核代码也有可能被清理掉。这可能在 5.17 或 5.18 进入内核主线。


老王点评：虽然不移除也不伤大雅，但是这种过时的遗留物还是清理了好。可喜的看到，Linux 内核现在正在做各种清理工作。]]></summary>

[美剧] 亢奋 第二季

关键词：剧情
片长：60 分钟（单集）× 8 集；豆瓣链接

堕落于日常的欲望，是不是真的就可以逃避现实呢？

@潘誉晗：之前的《亢奋 特别篇》显然没有满足粉丝的「胃口」，第二季一上线就打破了 HBO 流媒体成立以来的收视记录，首播当天更是由于过于火爆而造成平台系统的短暂崩溃。
本季的时间线设定在特别篇故事之后的一周，没有和茱尔丝一起离开的小茹最后还是复吸了，而两个人之间的纠葛注定不会因此就告一段落，她们的故事还将继续，而这种心里存在着小误会的青春隔阂，其实是动人的。
比起其他兼具大尺度和话题度的青春剧，这部剧无疑更盛。酒精、毒药、性爱、跨性别等在剧中被多次提及只是小意思而已，更神奇的是，即使这部剧在美国因尺度过大而被投诉，可我们还是会被剧中的人物和故事所感动，因为我们知道，剧…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谜一般的 emoji 矩阵
如果你关注社交网络，应该对最近密集出现的这样一种推文不陌生：主体内容只有红、绿、灰三色的 emoji 方块，再配上或兴奋或懊恼的寥寥数语。

不用担心，这不是什么邪教密码，也不是什么外星文字。其实，这只是个网页游戏 Wordle 的「每日战绩」。

不少读者可能对这个界面有点眼熟——看着挺像「填字游戏」（Crossword）。没错，从分类上看，Wordle 和填字游戏都属于字谜游戏的一种。在英语国家，字谜游戏有悠久的历史和广泛的受众，变化也很多样，填字游戏则是其中最具代表性的。

相比之下，Wordle 似乎在难度和形态上都大大简化：这个游戏每天更新一期，玩家唯一目标，就是在六次尝试机会之内，猜出一个五个字母的单词。
为此，游戏界面是一个 5×6 的方块阵列。玩家通过下方键盘输入猜测结果后，游戏会给字母方块标上颜色，提示猜测的准确性：

绿色 🟩：说明答案里有这个字母、所在位置也正确；
黄色 🟨：说明答案里有这个字母、但不在这个位置；
灰色 ⬜：说明答案里没有这个字母。

然后，玩家根据获得的提示继续尝试，直到猜对答案，或者用尽六次机会。
游戏结束后，会给玩家提供一份统计数据，显示各步骤的正确率、连续游玩的天数和下一局上线的倒计时；同时，会将玩家的游戏界面生成对应颜色布局的 emoji 矩阵，点击「share」按钮即可复制分享——这也就是文章开头那种密电一般推文的来源。
带你玩一局
规则说起来容易，但是为了让大家有更直观的印象，我们以 1 月 12 日的谜题为例，看一看实际玩起来到底是怎样的。

游戏开局，面对一张白纸，只能靠瞎猜。我的运气不错，随手打的「MOMMY」就命中了一个字母 O，只是所在位置不正确（黄色）。
于是，我换了一个也含有 O，但所在位置不同的「OTHER」继续试探。O 的位置仍然不对，但好在知道了字母 R 是我们需要的，并…]]></summary>

任何人都可以开始学习编程。我们都是从某个起点开始的，而且你不需要有计算机科学背景就可以学习编程。这就是 Linux 和开源的力量：任何人都可以学习一点编程。

如果你想学习一种新的编程语言，我们有几篇可以让你起步的很棒的文章。下面是我们最受欢迎的几篇文章，它们可以帮助到你。

比较编程语言

大多数编程语言都有某些相似之处。当你知道如何用一种编程语言做一件事，学习下一种编程语言主要是弄清其语法和结构。

不同的编程语言如何做同样的事情

学习一种新的编程语言的一个好方法是写一个简单的测试程序，如一个游戏，以探索该编程语言的工作原理。我经常写的一个示例程序是一个简单的“猜数字”游戏，即计算机在 1 到 100 之间挑选一个数字，让我猜出来。今年早些时候，我们发表了 一系列文章，探讨如何用几种编程语言编写猜数字游戏。了解这些不同的编程语言如何实现“猜数字”游戏的主要步骤。

不同的编程语言如何读写数据

Alan 的文章比较了不同的编程语言如何在相同的思想下 读写数据。无论这些数据是来自于配置文件还是用户创建的文件，在存储设备上处理数据对于编码者来说是很常见的。Alan 的比较文章提供了对几种流行的编程语言，如 C、Java、Groovy 和其他语言所采取的不同方法的深入了解。

学习一种新的编程语言

无论你是想学习一种新的编程语言，还是想探索一种现有的编程语言，请看看下面这些关于学习编程的好文章。

如何用 WebAssembly 编写 “Hello World”

WebAssembly 是一种字节码格式，几乎所有的浏览器都可以将其编译为主机系统的机器代码。与 JavaScript 和 WebGL 一起，WebAssembly 满足了将应用移植到网络浏览器中独立使用的需求。Stephan 解释了如何用 WASM-text 创建经典的 Hello World 程序。

用 Golang 轻松实现交叉编译

Gaurav 写了关于通过将脚本转换为 Go 程序来学习 Go 的交叉编译支持。你可以一次写好你的程序，并通过交叉编译为另一个环境进行编译。

为什么我使用 D 编程语言来编写脚本

D 编程语言由于其静态类型和元编程能力，常常被认为是一种系统编程语言。然而，它也是一种非常高效的脚本语言。Lawrence 写了关于如何利用 D 编程语言进行 普通的脚本编写。

借助于开源的力量，编程可以被任何人所接受。找到一个你想做的项目，并让它成为你进入编程的第一个项目。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你是一位少数派的老读者，那么你肯定对每次 Apple 发布会后的「少数派一图流」不陌生。此外，你肯定还在不少地方看过一些写满了文字的长图，在这之中不乏精美的排版，阅读的感受甚至优于一些活动性的网页。那么，这些好看的长文图片，要怎样才能制作出来？
来自某位不愿透露姓名的编辑
软件生成
如果你只是单纯需要制作一张长文图片，那么不少写作 App 中自带的导出为图片功能基本上就能满足了，例如桌面端的 Typora、Bear 和 Markdown，移动端的锤子便签、Zine 等等。我们只需要在 App 中直接撰写对应的内容，在导出时选择图片格式即可。
一般而言，上述这些 App 生成的图片效果都还不错，有些 App 还提供了自定义样式选择。而有些 App（例如 Typora）甚至还支持通过 CSS 完全自定义排版，可以说非常专业了。
Markdown 提供的导出为长图功能
不过，这些软件虽然提供了导出为长文图片的功能，但在很多时候可能却不尽如人意。例如，你没办法去控制字体的大小、行间距，以及字体、图片宽度、图片分辨率和精细度等等。即使可以，很多也都需要通过 Typora 这样，需要在 CSS 中进行调整，门槛较高且不够灵活。
除此之外，一些更有设计感的长文图片，这些 App 也都是无能为力的。所以如果你有更高阶的需求，那么不妨继续往下看。
自行排版
App 代劳的方式束缚太多，那么为什么我们不直接来排版呢？通过更加专业的排版设计软件，制作出一个完全符合我们预期的效果，其实并没有这么难。
别急着砍柴，先磨刀
如果要对图片中的每一个细节进行自定义，那么先不要急着打开电脑。首先先问自己：自己的审美大概在哪个水平？如果你觉得自己做出来的效果并不比 App 自动生成的更好看，或者你不太清楚自己到底要什么样的长文图片，那么我建议你先好好想想这个问题，不然做出来的效果可能并不能满足你的预期。

最近我妈妈过生日，本来我打算发一个大红包就可以了，媳妇提议买金首饰，逛金店的时候才发现，套路千层。
黄金期货才 370 左右，金店普遍都是 480 以上，还有 20-50 不等的加工费。
还有店员疯狂在推荐 5G 金，说他们的专利，结果每家店都有。
1 、先老凤祥看好了一对金挂坠，5G 金，一口价，都准备付钱了。媳妇随口问了句这个多重。但是柜员就不直说，说是质保单有，还疯狂给我说这个是 999 足金，以后不喜欢可以按现在标牌价换新（实际付款价格为标价的 9 折）。又问了一次，柜员还是重复前面的话，就是不正面回答。我听着不对劲，赶紧拉着媳妇跑了。
2 、后面又在六福珠宝看了另外一款，按 485 每克计价，额外每克收 22 的加工费。柜员还很热情给我说，最近有个活动，可以每克少 40 块。但是付钱要直接扫到她私人微信号，而不是走商场统一的支付。后面想了想还是不敢买。]]></summary>

这段时间因为疫情在家隔离，闲来无事就想起之前一直想要给 Flask 做一个可以热更新代码的插件系统，于是花了一周左右的时间研读了一遍 Flask 的源代码，并写了一个 Flask 扩展：Flask-Plugin 。
现阶段，使用它你可以：
与 Application 、Blueprint 相同的方式定义插件路由，同时提供所有的 Flask 功能（模板渲染、URL 构造、消息闪现、信号等等）
每个插件都可以在 Flask 运行时 启动、停止、重载。
与 Flask 一同配置，无需加载单独的配置文件。
插件自动发现与管理。
项目的文档还在编写中，同时我也在示例文件夹（ example ）中添加了两个简单的小项目，其中一个是移植自 flaskex 项目，而将这个原生 Flask 项目移植为插件仅仅改动了少量代码。
感兴趣的朋友可以前往项目地址： https://github.com/guiqiqi/flask-plugin
欢迎大家试用、反馈 Bug 、提交 PR 、点个 Star 🌟！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OPENAXT: 首先，这是我参与砍价的一款手机产品，大家可以看到我的进度是免费拿仅差百分之 00.9 ，进度条右侧停留在 99.1%，实际上从我领取了第一个 0.01 元后开始，到我砍掉许多 0.01 后，页面就一直保持这样没有发生过变化。我在砍价的时候一直很难理解，为什么百分比没变化。
在案件审理过程中，拼多多终于为我解答了疑惑，大家看看他们是怎么说的：
他们说因页面显示百分比位数有限，所以他们把一个至少小数点后有 6 位数以上的百分比，直接省略显示为 0.9%，原来我的 0.9%不是 0.9%，而是 0.9996427%，在这一刻，我感觉我前 30 年的数学都白学了，我的人生需要重新定义一下 0.9%。
我们的法庭问对方为什么不在页面显示完整百分比，他们说显示屏有限，而且这个数是除不尽的所以贴心的为大家做了省略，我听到这里只觉得好笑，你都可以在 0.9 前面加一个 0 ，写成 00.9 了，却不把 0.9 后面哪怕一个小数点写出来，这是为什么呢？也许也是贴心的考虑到我们玩砍价免费拿的玩家，数学比较差，都不会计算小数点后 2 位的加减法吧。
另外，100-99.1 只能等于 0.9 整，对方说 0.9 后面有小数点，那么为什么在我的进度条会显示 99.1 呢，难道他们又要给我重新定义 99.1 的概念吗？在这里呢，对方说这个是什么程序上的显示法，99 后面只要有数，他们就进位显示成 99.1 ，而且进度只有 100 ，他们不可能显示加起来超过 100 ，他们这可不是欺骗哦，朋友们，大家说说看，在进度条只有 100 的情况下，哪一种程序上的算法可以让 100-99.1 所得的 0.9 后面有至少 6 位数小数点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have developed a small social network web app for educational purpose and want to share this with the community. This app is built with ReactJS for frontend, Java Spring Boot for backend and MongoDB as the database.
The app tries to mimic a few functions of Twitter, including:
Create post with text and image
The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters
Like, comment and re-post a post
View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post
Comments are toggle
The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters
Follow, un-follow someone
See who are following us and follow them back
Check who we are following
View all posts of an individual
View our own posts
List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)
Other functions:
Due to limited storage space, client app compresses the uploaded image to the maximum of 250px (width or height)
User avatar is created by hashing user id and convert that hash code into a hexagonal image
Authentication and authorization use JWT
Responsive frontend for desktop and mobile devices
Technical stack:
Frontend: ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Bootstrap
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Database: MongoDB
If this project is useful for you , please give me a Github star ⭐ for my effort!

事情是这样的，我以前的宽带套餐是 199 的套餐，之前在网上看到有人说可以用漫游的方式实现根据信号强度自动切换路由而且很稳定，在这方面我是小白，之后正好有电信客服联系我说可以升级 239 套餐，而且还可以免费帮我实现全屋信号优化，我以为是用的刚刚看到的漫游技术，我就接受了套餐升级。结果给我安装的时候只是安装了 2 个路由器，然后路由器名字不一样要我手动切换，这种方式我自己买个路由器就行，还需要他们来帮忙吗？
另外有个问题想问下，电信的安装人员说如果要做漫游，需要漫游的两个路由器直连，也就是说需要把一个路由器装在光猫的盒子里，可是这样那个装在光猫盒子里面的路由器信号就差了，漫游也失去了意义，相当于我损失了客厅的信号加强了卧室的信号。关于这个说法是正确的吗？正确的漫游方式到底是怎么样的？我通过学习可以自己在家里实现漫游吗？]]></summary>

自己实现了，但现在主要的问题是产品嫌速度慢，和原生相机拍照速度有差距。
要求速度是基本和原生相机 app 一样，点一下照片就拍完了，不能有明显的停顿感。
但拍照 sdk 这种需求比较少，一般 app 如果专做拍照，那肯定不用第三方了。

For a generation of young people who have de-stigmatized mental illness, we are shocked to discover that finding a therapist is as appalling as our dating culture: an arduous ghosting game. Patients wait an average of 10 weeks to see a mental health professional, just to receive a diagnosis!

本周话题：最大的机会来自新技术
上周六是 iPhone 诞生十五周年。
2007年1月9日，乔布斯从口袋里掏出一个小玩意，对着全世界说，今天苹果公司重新发明了电话。


你还记得那个时刻吗？
当时谁能想到，这个小玩意对人类社会的改变，将是如此巨大！
过去的十五年，可能是历史上科技变革最快的时期。回忆以前的生活，恍若隔世，没有微信、没有二维码、没有手机付款、网络外卖、手机打车、手机直播......
短短十五年，智能手机就把这些东西，推广到了城市和乡村的每一个角落。
这带来了极其巨大的商业机会。十五年前，小米（2010年4月6日成立）、美团（2010年1月成立）、字节跳动（2012年3月成立）、滴滴（2012年6月成立）这些巨头都还不存在。（顺便提一句，比特币的诞生是在2009年1月3日。）
一个革命性的设备出现，能带来这么多机会！
现在回想起来，我多么希望，在乔布斯掏出 iPhone 的那个时刻，我能够意识到它会带来无与伦比的机会，从而转向这个方向发展。那样的话，人生将会多么不同啊。
可惜，当时我完全没有这种意识，只觉得 iPhone 只是一个时髦的产品，比黑莓或者塞班手机更好用一些，市场潜力大概跟它们差不多。我就这样错过了机会。
手机革命开始很久以后，我才意识到，自己的眼光有多么局限和短浅。我也由此明白了，五年后、十年后、十五年后，科技带来的巨大变化，是你所无法…]]></summary>

Unfortunately today there are many species in danger of extinction or disappearing.
SPECIESS is a space that aims to help a little to raise awareness about this problem as a website to create, explore and share artworks with CSS on endangered species taken from the IUCN Red List
You can check it at: speciess.vercel.app

 SPECIESS 
   
This project is born as an initiative for the Atlas MongoDB & Dev.to Hackaton. 😄
SPECIESS is an space where to create, explore and share CSS art about endangered species (from the IUCN Red List) and so spread raise awareness about it.
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
First, run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
Next.js Documentation - learn about Next.js features and API.
Learn Next.js - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
View on GitHub
This project is built using Next.js and deployed with Vercel.
I am using the powerful MongoDB Atlas.
This DB storing information about 142 000 species from the IUCN Red List.
It's my first time using MongoDB and I found it quite easy to get started with, even with a lot of documentation, but understandable.
I am using the MongoDB Data API to store some info.
It was very interesting and comfortable to use MongoDB Charts in this project too.
Here are some screenshots of the project:






PS: I really liked how powerful MongoDB Atlas is, my only observation would be that it would be great to add more examples with more use cases for Node.js 😉]]></summary>

2021 年前，我和身边朋友说 “5G 并没有什么太大作用，并且投入产出比都没有未来经济效益” 该言论让我成为茶余饭后的谈资，负面的，搞笑的，弱智的代表。
因为当时基本上所有朋友包括很多网络工程师都相信“5G 会改变未来” 除了我在运营商和部份搞 EE 的朋友，他们和我一样，是非常小众的一群人。
2022 年了，全世界 5G 密度最高，部署量最大，政策最用的国家，就是中国了。
而 5G 是不是好，目前我在运营商和 EE 的朋友都呵呵一笑。
而 5G 的炒作也已经冷淡下来。
有个朋友和我说“国内部署的 5G 基站已经比整个欧洲都多了，从我们的层面看这是不合理的，但是从补贴层面看，我管他啊”]]></summary>

We built a web application using the Shiny framework from the R programming language to help users locate & report at-home COVID-19 test kits. You can check out the web app live in action here for the State of Connecticut!
This app works very similar to the Waze app, in that the data that populates the app is entirely user-driven. Through the UI, users have the ability to add a new record to the back-end MongoDB Atlas database (i.e., where/when they saw COVID-19 at-home test kits in stock), and remove a record (where/when they saw COVID-19 at-home test kits out of stock).
The purpose of this project spawned from seeing so many disjointed Facebook forum questions/answers about where people could find at-home COVID-19 antigen test kits. There was no single place t…]]></summary>

A healthy codebase is one that’s optimized for testability, maintainability, and scalability. It helps programmers code more efficiently and makes engineering teams more productive. 
The health of a company’s codebase plays a large role in employee satisfaction. Unfortunately, the pressure to quickly add new features imposes harsh deadlines on programmers. The trade-off is a decrease in code quality. This is the reality of the software development world.

首先这里声明一下
一 、Overqualified 在 IT 相关专业上基本不存在，但是 EE 就还是有的。
二、以硅谷程序员为代表的留学生群体普遍认为 IT 之外的少数几个专业都是白读的。因为他们的薪水根本没办法和硅谷对标。而没有选择 IT 就是他们人生路上的失败（一堆硅谷 IT 的失败学定义）
三、IT 专业确实是目前普通人在正常努力范围内可以拿到薪水较高的工作，但是不代表其它专业不重要。生化环材是世界的基石。虽然他们在硅谷 IT 人眼里都是笑话。
正式开始讲讲
很多人都说在澳洲，本科比研究生好。所以甚至传出了澳洲的研究生都是水货，本科才是最好的，要么本科要么博士，千万不要读研究生这种言论。
为什么会出现这种言论的呢，本质上是因为我们这边对性价比太看重了，即我毕业后一定要像国内 985 ，211 一样要在就职市场横着走，如果不是的，就是不好的。
但是实际上，在澳洲除了华人企业和部份小的企业，大部份情况下，研究生出门确实在工作上出现了困难，比如我的老婆和我老婆的同学，他们都是传统专业毕业的，不像 IT 毕业就是澳洲收入中位数，他们毕业要找工作非常困难。]]></summary>

看起来 Aarch64 机器算质数会更快一些，但实际上编译 CMake 来看：

aarch64: 1m20.135s

另一个项目更加明显

显然 x86_64 机器会更快。我已经尽可能排除两台机器其他变量的干扰（均有 64GB 内存，NVME 固态硬盘）。

Before we discuss about what a web service API is, let's learn what what a web service is.
The term Web service is either: a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents.

I made an Express application which basically calculates the path from one station to another in a particular city's Metro rail map.
It connects to the database on Mongodb Atlas. My database has collections based on maps of different cities.
The app is very easily scalable, as to add a map, one only has to add a new collection in the database (containing Station names etc) and one option in the "Map Select" drop-down.
Here is the link to my Github repository.
Choose Your Own Adventure
 / 
        metro-path-mongodb
      
    
Note: The Mongodb database may refuse to connect sometimes. I am finding a fix for that
This is a Metro Rail Path Finder app I made for Dev.to + MongoDb Atlas Hackathon. It sources its data from Mongodb Atlas Database.
Technology Used: Expressjs, MongoDb Atlas
Just make sure that node and npm are installed and
npm start


And it will be deployed on http://localhost:3000/users/details
The calculation may get slow for longer paths.

Technology Used: Express, Mongodb, Atlas

xChange is an app designed in SwiftUI for iOS that helps meet users from different parts of the globe. It uses “Letter”, in which users can create letters, through which users can share their thoughts and feelings as notes to which users within the local region can react and get in touch with. Users with premium features can get access to the global feature where they can interact with letters all over the globe. The app uses MongoDB Realm for authentication and CRUD operations as local persistence storage, and is deployed on to MongoDB Atlas whenever a trigger to the app is viewed. The app mainly focuses on how people can interact with each other, merely based on their thoughts.

The app uses MongoDB Realm for authentication and CRUD operations as local persistence storage, and is deployed on to MongoDB Atlas whenever a trigger to the app is viewed. The app mainly focuses on how people can interact with each other, merely based on their thoughts.

MongoDB Realm
MapKit and CoreLocation

The application uses MapKit, and CoreLocation for determining current location using Apple Maps to analyse the current location of users to deploy the letter in such a way that it binds the users of the same location. Using Realm, the data is bound with local CoreData within the iPhone and can be deployed to MongoDB Atlas.

空安全
在 Java 不用强制我们处理空对象，所以常常会导致 NullPointerException 空指针出现，现在 Kotlin 对空对象进行了限定，必须在编译时处理对象是否为空的情况，不然会导致编译不通过
在对象不可空的情况下，可以直接使用这个对象
fun getText() : String {
    return "text"
}

val text = getText()
print(text.length)

在对象可空的情况下，必须要判断对象是否为空
fun getText() : String? {
    return null
}

val text = getText()
if (text != null) {
    print(text.length)
}

// 如果不想判断是否为空，可以直接这样，如果 text 对象为空，则会报空指针异常，一般情况下不推荐这样使用
val text = getText()
print(text!!.length)

// 还有一种更好的处理方式，如果 text 对象为空则不会报错，但是 text.length 的结果会等于 null
val text = getText()
print(text?.length)

方法支持添加默认参数
在 Java 方法上，我们可能会为了扩展某个方法而进行多次重载

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是不跟随
这段时间打 VALORANT ，有个队友只要一起打了，话题里总少不了「鼠标」和「握姿」这两个关键词。于是一个朋友受不了了，跟我吐槽。
首先让我们明确一点，你玩任何游戏，上限一定不是你的鼠标和你的握姿。决定你上限的只有你的训练量和你的年龄。打不准，那就多练；反应慢，一个是多练，还有一个就是你不再年轻。
这个队友呢，年纪比较小，还没有形成自己的一套体系。所以总是想跟着 UP 主的理论去选择自己的鼠标。并且对于握姿的选择非常纠结，总是在为了「哪个握姿上限更高」这样的问题来回矛盾。那么就让我们再明确一次，握姿与你的上限无关。举个很简单的例子，CSGO 传奇选手 Simple 的鼠标握姿既不是抓握也不是趴握更不是指握，而是将趴握和抓握混合在一起运用。
所谓「不跟随」，在上一篇我说过，对于游戏设备，我们「更多的关注应该在，它是不是符合你的需求」。盲目地迷信传感器参数或者鼠标尺寸与手掌大小这些参数，并不能帮你找到合适的鼠标并且提升能力。一千个人的心中有一千个哈姆雷特，同样，对于鼠标的选择，每个人都是不一样的。别人的数据只是参考，真正应该关注的，反而应该是自己的使用体验。

我的选择与标准
首先，让我们看看鼠标类型
鼠标无非两种类型，一种是对称鼠标，一种是人体工学鼠标。而人体工学鼠标往往很多厂家又会对它在某些方面进行优化。总体来讲就是这两大类。
对称鼠标的代表，近几年比较火的，就是罗技的 G pro wireless 与雷蛇的毒蝰系列。人体工学鼠标的代表就是 Steelseries 当年为微软代工的 IE 3.0 系列鼠标。喜欢用哪一种，因人而异。有的人喜欢对称，有的人喜欢人体工学，甚至有人喜欢强制人体工学。对称鼠标，就如同名字一样，鼠标是对称的。人体工学鼠标，是贴合人手放松状态下的模样做出的鼠标，因此这种类型的鼠标与手的贴合度高，手指有充分的休息区域。
再来，我的选择标准

默认都是 1 ，如果一直都是 1 的话，也好理解，就是普通蓝牙音响。但是偏偏偶尔情况下能触发 2 ，导致我很好奇
而且根据我的体验，我也是更喜欢 2 的（音响播放 bgm ，同时手机玩别的）
现在已知可以触发 2 的方式：
1 对话音响的 siri ，比如播放周杰伦的歌，就会用 qq 音乐单独播放（只是很傻，想听龙卷风，结果播放的是另一首歌）
2 对话音响，调用自己设置过的捷径，也能触发 2

来个引导
1.做了很久的 saas 微信商铺系统，不想再做了
2.过了今天，我的项目就跨度三年了
3.虽然还没有完工， 但我还是迫不及待的想“炫技”下我的项目
4.分享下我的独立开发日记 01
5.分享下我的独立开发日记 02
6.分享下我的独立开发日记 03
项目简介: 以微商城+支付营销为主体的私域 saas 项目；
项目网址: http:www.f-space.cn:6060, 申请备案一个月了，还没通过
下班回家，打开电脑，花了半小时完善了店铺的数据模型，接下来开始 CRUD 。。。
晚上 11 点多了，先不敲逻辑了，总结一下
跟一个朋友沟通，企业对数据安全和隐私太敏感了
这块我一直忽略，这几天换位思考：
你是一个 Saas 服务，我所有的销售数据、会员数据全放在你那，你倒闭咋办？服务不稳定咋办？ 数据丢失了昨弄？
大意了！！！这一块也是重中之重。
作为一个程序员，我能想到的
涉及安全方面
登录不能粗暴的种 cookie ，要把用户的地域、网络环境也放进去，当发生特别大的改变时，Cookie 无效
密码错误，对该账户时间递增暂定登录服务
记录每一个登录日志
JS 注入，Demo 网址开放后，大家真的好喜欢注入，那么所有的输入都要进行严格的过滤
数据的报障方面
群集，加强数据的备份
多云部署，这个要根据成本来考虑，但现在云也便宜了 腾讯云 8 核 16G 三年还不到￥ 2000 ，可以搞起
备份，写个定时脚本 深夜触发，但数据量大了咋办呢？
高可用
这一块一直在进行, 对一个初始项目，权重没那么高
分布式 包括服务、数据库、搜索、Cache
细节的优化 HTTP2 、BR 压缩、启用 Webp 、升级 TLS
高延迟的任务全部异步化
数据敏感问题
这个是 Saas 无法避免的问题，对同质的需求提供统一的服务，还真没办法解决。。。
难道加钱独立部署么？
额外：
以前一直忽略物联网， 对于库存的管理，我一直想的是条形码管理，今天在用无人零售柜，看了下它的电子标签，
咿 RFID 射频识别， 同步到互联网，对仓储管理肯定也好用啊]]></summary>

今天看见一款鞋好喜欢，Fila 的 BARRICADE ，后跟干净利落，脚尖圆圆的，但看了一眼价格心都凉透了……唉~

听着，这是你的第二十个年头，所以这有一些事情需要你懂得，并且根植于心：
1. 做你真正想做的事情，道德和法律都不应该成为你的障碍；
2. 不要总围着人类打转。在这个世界上，除了人类，还有很多事物，所以不要总以人类为参照，在其他事物上你会获得更多东西；
3. 当你接触一些事物的时候，请试图发现它的本质。怎样拍电影，怎样拍照片，怎样创建一家公司，当你懂得它们的原理，你会变得更有创造力；
4. 世间没有真理。对那些指引你的人，以及书籍，请始终抱持怀疑。如果有真理，那可能只针对大多数人，而没准你就属于那少数的几个人；
5. 创造比学习更快乐，更有趣，也更重要；
6. 永远做自己的朋友和后背，只有这样你才能避免孤独；
7. 你现在所说的话，只代表你当前的想法。所以半途而废是很正常的，没有必要责备自己。当然，不要轻易对他人和自己做出承诺。

没想到当初的自己爱喝鸡汤，哈哈。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能可以识别匿名棋手

研究人员收集了多次下棋的棋手记录，并从中抽取了多达 32 步的序列。他们对每一步棋进行编码，并将其输入一个神经网络，每个棋手的棋谱形成了一个点群。研究发现，该系统可以在 86% 的时间里识别匿名的玩家，而人工识别的准确率只有 28%。经过调整，它也可以对扑克牌做同样的事情。他们说，在理论上，如果有合适的数据集，这种系统可以根据人们的驾驶习惯或使用手机的时间和地点来识别他们。


老王点评：人类的很多行为，其实在 AI 眼中都是非常明显的痕迹。




Ubuntu 桌面版降低硬件门槛

由于 Ubuntu 桌面对内存的需求比较大，因此如果在树莓派上使用的话，Ubuntu 推荐用户使用 4GB/8GB 内存的型号，以避免在慢速的 SD 卡上发生交换。Canonical 宣布 进一步降低 Ubuntu Desktop 的硬件门槛，支持在 2GB 内存的树莓派 4 上运行。之所以能够降低硬件需求，主要是得到了 zswap 功能的支持，可以减少交换到慢速 SD 卡的进程。该功能可以在进程要被转移到交换文件时，对其进行压缩，以决定是否需要放到交换文件，否则可以避免交换，而解压成本要低得多。


老王点评：不用等 22.04 ，当前版本中经过设置也可以启用 zswap。




Chrome 将阻止外部域名访问本地网络

为防止恶意脚本悄悄在浏览器上执行本地 HTTP 请求，Chrome 将 实现 名为 私有网络访问（PNA） 的 W3C 新规范，阻止这一被恶意程序滥用的行为。新功能将在今年上半年推出，PNA 将在 Chrome 中引入一个机制，外部域名在尝试与本地网络设备建立连接前需要征得许可，如果本地设备如服务器或路由器没有回应，尝试建立连接的请求将被阻止。


老王点评：我以为这是已经是默认行为了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[只需掌握一点 C 语言的知识，你就可以做很多事情。




我精通几种编程语言，但我最喜欢的是 C 语言。C 语言开发于 20 世纪 70 年代，作为一种系统编程语言，在 2021 年仍然是最受欢迎的编程语言之一。如果你想探索 C 语言的几个特点，可以从去年的这些热门文章开始：

在 C 语言中使用 getopt 进行短选项解析

如果你的程序每次运行时都能对用户作出反应，你就可以使它变得更加灵活。让你的用户告诉你的程序使用什么文件或如何以不同的方式做事情。为此，你需要读取命令行。这篇文章 告诉你如何使用 argv 直接读取命令行，并使用 getopt 读取短命令行选项。

在 Linux 中用 ncurses 定位屏幕上的文本

大多数 Linux 工具只是从屏幕的底部滚动文本。但如果你想在屏幕上定位文本，比如游戏或数据显示，该怎么办？这就是 ncurses 的作用。

用 DOS conio 开始编程

C 语言并不只适用于 Linux。你可以在许多操作系统上找到 C，包括 DOS。许多 C 程序员控制控制台输入和输出的标准方法是使用 conio 库。学习如何 使用 conio` 来更新 DOS 程序的控制台，包括文本颜色和文本窗口。

使用位域和掩码编写国际象棋游戏

在 C 语言程序中关联信息的标准方法是使用一个结合了两个或多个相关字段的结构体。例如，你可以用一个结构体来跟踪棋盘上的棋子。但是有一种更直接的方法来跟踪同样的信息，同时使用更少的数据和内存。使用 二进制位域和掩码，你可以存储一个单一的值来识别每个方格中的棋子和颜色。

C 语言编程中的 5 个常见错误以及如何修复它们

即使是最好的程序员也会产生编程错误。根据你的程序所做的事情，这些 bug 可能会引入安全漏洞，导致程序崩溃，或产生意外的行为。但是，通过一点额外的代码，你可以避免最常见和最严重的 C 语言编程错误。这里有 五个可能破坏你的应用的 bug 以及你如何避免它们。

只需一点 C 语言知识，你就可以做很多事情。探索新的方法，为你的下一个 C 语言编程项目增加功能。

像 IMEI 、Mac Address 等能唯一标识的都被谷歌拎出来加了权限。这个问题困扰我蛮久的，因为我发现其它应用仍然可以，但当然不是直接显示什么 IMEI 和 Address 啥的，感觉是提出来的特征码，我以为是从各个属性里面提出来一些拼凑的，但思来想去好像也不对呀，因为唯一 key 都被加权限了，所以我觉得可能是低 targetSdkVersion 的原因，但这也只是觉得。
所以我想询问下，还有没有机会获取到 Android 设备级的唯一标识？我是正常目的用，因为有些用户买了软件的单机版，虽然告知了不要卸载，但为了体验，还是应该端永久，但我实在没辙，我想在外部存储放一个激活文件，但是用户也很有可能删掉，比如无意删掉、格式化设备等。]]></summary>

@BeckMint：GL8 座椅

入手渠道：闲鱼自购
入手价格：518 元

前年老麦搞了个人体工学座椅的测评，做完之后我挑了最硬的那个网易严选的座椅，一坐就是一年多。这个座椅除了硬之外，坐着坐着屁股还会往下滑，但我对于座椅没什么太大要求，就将就着了。
最近在网上看到一句话，大概意思是挑选电脑椅，就挑最难坐的，难坐到你想经常站起来走走。我一想这不就是我的情况嘛，然后连续站立办公了两天，当天晚上睡觉到三点钟，小腿抽筋了……
就是这个契机，我想换个舒服点的办公座椅。
又刚好在微博上看到有人炫耀将 GL8 的中排座椅改成办公座椅，说什么是最舒服的座椅，还比什么人体工学座椅便宜多了，好奇之下买了回来。

整个座椅非常重，具体没称过，但收货时是我和物流小哥合力搬上来的，累的够呛。
座椅除了椅子部分，还有底部商家自己做的带万向轮的支架。

支架比较粗糙，安装时也不是对着槽镶嵌，而是用螺丝强行固定的，装好后是个正方形结构，还是偏移到右边的。

座椅底下部分真的不忍直视，但其实平时也看不到。
商家声称是新车改装拆掉，是全新的，看上去还行，有些污渍应该是拆卸或搬运过程中留下的。

右手边有杯托，按压一下就弹出，可以放个保温杯，不占桌面还挺好。

还有备受同事嘲笑的安全带，但你们不知道我做事又快又稳，安全第一吗。

座椅靠背可以往后放倒，看上去可以躺平的。其实汽车座椅如果要在上面睡觉，腰部肯定要额外的支撑，一个靠谱的腰枕是必不可少的。

头枕也可以根据不同身高，后脑勺的位置进行上下调节。但汽车座椅的头枕是为了安…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[付费订阅服务是一个时不时就会引起热议的话题。去年底，国内外就分别出现过两次付费订阅相关的讨论。
国内，爱奇艺在 2021 年 12 月 15 日进行了全方面的提价，他们认为「视频平台的会员订阅价格一直偏低，这一现象已影响到了行业的健康发展」了；国外，网红笔记软件 Notability 从「买断制」转成订阅制，在引起广泛不满后道歉，并宣布老用户无需订阅亦可使用已购功能。
在涉及订阅制和付费的讨论中，一种常见论述是「国外用户付费意愿高，服务定价也高；国内用户付费意愿低，服务定价也低」。这种说法在多大程度上是准确的呢？下面我们分别来讨论。
国外用户付费意愿一定更高吗？
在我看来，如今国内网友们付费的意愿并不低；虽然有些应用突然改成订阅很难受，但开发者要生存大家也能理解，对于质量好的也越发愿意付费支持。此类事件中，更让大家觉得懊恼的，是厂商并没有给付费用户提供更好的、符合预期的产品，例如应用对已解锁功能重复收费、视频平台展示所谓「会员专属广告」等。
当然，准确的观察还是要通过数据来得出。
2021 年，美国一家咨询公司 West Monroe 对 2500 名美国用户开展了调查，并于八月发布了一份题为《订阅服务开支现状》（The State of Subscription Services Spending）的报告。报告显示，2021 年美国消费者人均订阅服务开支为每月 273 美元，比疫情前 2018 年的 237 美元提高了 15%。这相当于每年多花了 430 美元，折合人民币近 3000 元。

需要指出，West Monroe 报告中的「订阅服务」包括了网费、手机话费等，这些服务在美国的价格非常高昂，而且也不属于本文想讨论的「订阅服务」范畴。将这两项（合计 150 美元）除去后，剩下的实际平均开支应为每人每月 123 美元。
那我们国内的情况怎么样呢？由于找不到比较系统的研…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为独立开发者 + 业余吉他手，很早前就想开发一款练习歌曲的工具。因为在练习歌曲时，经常需要针对某一个片段播放上百上千次，有时候需要变调（演奏跟原调不一样）、变速等…… 
这些场景在使用 QQ 音乐之类的播放器时，就显得略为不便，找了一圈也没发现特别趁手的工具。得益于技术的进步，特别是音轨分离的技术（有兴趣可以参考 Splitter.ai）的成熟，感觉针对于「如何更高效地学习歌曲」这个课题，我们可以做出一些更 Cool 更好玩有用的东西。
这就有了我们最近发布的一款音乐工具产品：AudioJam。
功能介绍
使用 AI 技术，AudioJam 能从任意的歌曲中，提取出人声、鼓、贝斯、钢琴或键盘、吉他以及其他的音轨，并可以调整音量 Remix。这个技术在扒谱或者跟歌练习的时候特别有用。
为了表现它惊艳的分离效果，我制作了一个简单的视频：
 
分离了音轨之后，在电脑端你甚至可以通过重新安排不同乐器的位置，重新混响音乐，模拟更真实的效果。

设置并保存循环之后，就可以不断重复该循环，用于片段的练习。

如果是常用软件，每个细节都是很重要的，因为如果不好用，那每次使用都会给自己添堵。所以在 AudioJam 中，与传统播放器只能通过拖动进度条来定位不同，你还可以拖动波形图，做到精准地控制播放的位置。AudioJam 还支持直接长按波形图由该位置开始慢速预览，这在扒取一些快速音符的时候很有用。
通过降速功能则可以有效地降低学习难度，也可以通过升降调，找到最适合自己演奏的曲调。

「音乐附件」是我自己很喜欢的一个功能，可以在音乐项目中。创建便签来记录扒谱的结果、需要注意的地方，也可以导入现有的曲谱，当前附件支持预览 Guitar Pro 的曲谱。将歌曲的学习项目化。

我个人觉得对于歌曲学习来说，移动应用并非最好用的工具，在歌曲学习这件事情上，我还是比较喜欢桌面应用，可以更精准地控制跟快速地输入，因此 AudioJam 支持了 iOS、Android、macOS、Windows 4 个平台。

自动扒谱？
很多朋友，在试用了 AudioJam 之后都给我提出了一个想法，它能不能做到自动扒谱呢？这个课题我个人的看法是这样的：
我个人不太认可自动扒谱这件事情，因为音乐学习，不应该以变成「人肉读谱机」为目标。而是通过视听扒谱，去理解鉴赏这个音乐作品，而这个过程是就是不断提升自己音乐审美观以及听力的过程，不应该通过技术来偷懒。
现在互联网的信息发达，大部分的歌曲都能找到别人精心编排好的乐谱，自动扒取的还无法达到这样的水平。不过我也可能会在未来添加上这样的功能。因为扒谱这件事对新手而言太不友好了，如果能自动扒谱的话，作为一个「参考答案」来辅助学习扒谱的话，可以让学习扒谱这件事变得更简单，学习曲线更平缓，也是一个「高效学习」的好功能。
所以我们也有在调研一些相关的技术，如果有朋友对相关的音视频技术有研究的话，也欢迎跟我们一起探讨。

如果你也有在玩一些乐器，比如吉他、鼓、钢琴或键盘之类的。AudioJam 绝对是一款对音乐学习很有帮助的产品。希望你可以自己下载来体验试试。
最后，学无止境，与君共勉。希望大家能一直保持，对吉他和对音乐的热爱。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[早在 2017 年，我便萌生了写一篇读书总结文章的念头，那一年是我开始大规模读书的第一年，在那之前不过是每年读个三五本书。至今我都记得 2017 年第一本读完的书是《杀死一只知更鸟》，但到现在，书里的人物、剧情全然忘却，只记得那是一本有关教养与教化的书籍。
五年过去了，每年我都能读完至少三四十本书，可如今再翻看那些书单，大多数书籍都和《知更鸟》一样，在记忆中没有留下什么痕迹。于是在今年，我开始了写读书笔记的计划，长篇大论也好、三五句也行。我在读完一本书时，趁着记忆还没消散，就把杂想随想写下，在今后随时翻阅时希冀能回想起什么。也因如是，才有了这一篇总结文章。
每一天，我都会在夜晚睡觉前，躺在床上捧着 Kindle 读半小时书再入睡。从去年底开始我用上了专注计时工具，来摒除手机对专注阅读的影响。因为不知道哪款软件更趁手，索性同时使用了 iHour 和 OffScreen 来专注计时。到如今打开 App 看统计数据，今年的累计阅读时间已经超过 227 小时了。
我们常常高估一天能做成的事，却往往低估一年能做的事。

除了睡前阅读，偶尔我也会在通勤地铁里、出差飞机上，还有咖啡店里读书。本文中的所有图片都是这一年我在杭州咖啡探店时拍摄的，衷心感谢杭州精品咖啡店提供的美味咖啡☕️。
《怎样才能不杀死你的植物》
《怎样才能不杀死你的植物》 是我在 1 月份读完的，这本书对于我而言是家养绿植的启蒙书。在我读完这本书之后先后养起了龟背竹、富贵竹、琴叶榕、牛油果这四类植物。快一年过去了，到现在还谈不上棵棵枝繁叶茂，但至少还没有被我杀死。
作者妮卡·萨瑟恩是英国网红植物商店的店主，在她商店的 Instagram 账号上，有大量精美好看的插花作品。她常年和植物打交道，自然而然地对于如何才能把家养绿植养得生机勃勃这一问题，有着丰富的养护经验。妮卡的方法论便是追根溯源，只要去了解植物的原生环境，并在家…]]></summary>

        <id>http://www.zhihu.com/question/447334290/answer/1764224457</id>
        <link href="http://www.zhihu.com/question/447334290/answer/1764224457?utm_campaign=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_content=title"/>
        <updated>2022-01-13T03:49:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个题目分为两个方面：
一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；
二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。
1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？
1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的
将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。
最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。
1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度
将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。
如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。
这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。
只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。
下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。

1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果
至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。



2.什么样的是好发动机
热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。
低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。
低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。
高可靠性无需多言。
两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #效率 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

前言
我之前在 Newsletter 里分享了用 Craft X Snippets 记录晨间日记的方法，评论区收到一个关于 Daily Notes 如何归档整理的小问题，回复中也思考了一番 Craft 这个应用本身。作为我在过去的一年中最喜爱、又带给我很大帮助的应用，想在新年伊始为它当一回「传教者」，在此展开讲讲，它有哪些特别之处，我为何喜欢它，以及一些使用上的研究和小技巧；当然，也会有它的不足。

Craft 是去年 Apple 评选的 Mac App of the Year，也获得了 Apple Design Award「交互」赛道提名，足以说明它一定有值得称道之处。少数派在 App Store Awards 2021 这篇文章中说它是：

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

是的，Craft 在 2020 年 11 月正式上线，到今天也就差不多一年的工夫。团队的精心打磨，使得它一上线就有着非常高的完成度。而过去一年中又陆续发布了 21 个大更新和 26 个小更新，也就是说，几乎每 2-2.5 周就会有一个大更新。我是从 iOS App Store 推荐知道它的，抱着试一试的态度，拿到手就被教学关近乎完美的动效吸引。在花了一点点时间探索，并看了帮助…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[项目环境切换问题：
遇到的问题：
1.项目网络环境很多，包括5楼环境（网络地址和MQTT地址不同）、12楼环境（网络地址和MQTT地址相同）、新部署环境等，每次打包修改地址容易出错且耗时
2.APP的自动更新依赖于版本名和VersionCode，项目依赖的AAR包经常更新
解决方案：
利用gradle构建工具的特性，修改build.gradle脚本，实现网络环境根据版本名自动切换，这样查看APK文件名就能知道网络环境，且不需要反复修改地址代码
使用manifestPlaceholders控制网络切换:


效果：
以前切换网络环境、切换AAR、发布版本需要修改内容：




需要修改4个文件的6处内容
重构后切换网络环境、切换AAR、发布版本需要修改内容：

只需修改一个文件的两处内容：一个是AAR版本，一个是版本名
版本号、AAR依赖、网络环境会自动根据以上两处进行切换，只需根据注释修改
代码实现
1.在manifest文件的Application标签内增加：


2.在java代码中增加：
public static int getMetaDataInt(String metaName, int defaultValue) {
    try {
        return MyApplication.getInstance().getPackageManager()
                .getApplicationInfo(MyApplication.getInstance().getPackageName(), PackageManager.GET_META_DATA)
                .metaData.getInt(metaName, defaultValue);
    } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return defaultValue;
    }
}

3.在app的build.gradle中使用：
//----------------------根据versionName自动配置网络->->->->->->-------------------
def hospital_net = 0, floor_12 = 1, new_env = 2
def network_env
if (versionName.toString().startsWith("2")) {
    network_env = floor_12
} else if (versionName.toString().startsWith("3")) {
    network_env = new_env
} else {
    network_env = hospital_net
}
manifestPlaceholders = [network_env: network_env,]

versionName '1.2.04' // 1开头是院内环境，2开头就是12楼环境，3开头是新部署环境
//------]]></summary>

D8
D8是一款用于取代 DX、更快的 Dex 编译器，可以生成更小的 APK;
开启D8的好处
编译更快、时间更短
编译时占用内存更小
.dex文件更小
.dex 文件拥有更好的运行时性能
支持在代码中使用 Java 8 语言
开启与关闭
Android Studio 3.0 需要主动在gradle.properties文件中新增:android.enableD8=true
D8作为DX的一个替代方案,Android Studio 3.1版本开始，将D8作为默认的Dex编译器。
想关闭D8 ，可以在gradle.properties里添加如下配置：
android.enableD8=false //关闭D8恢复到DX-
android.enableD8.desugaring=false //恢复到以前的行为，让脱糖发生在Java编译之后，.class字节码仍遵循Java 7格式

执行增量构建
为了在开发过程中提高构建速度（例如提高持续集成 build 的速度），可以指示 d8 仅编译项目的部分 Java 字节码;
例如，如果启用了按类 dexing 处理，则只需重新编译自上次构建以来修改过的类(d8 无法自动检测哪些字节码文件已被修改过，因此您需要手动指定类列表)：
//执行几个类的增量构建，并启用按类 dexing 处理,并为增量构建指定输出目录
d8 MainActivity.class R.class --intermediate --file-per-class --output ~/build/intermediate/dex

可以使用 --main-dex…]]></summary>

前言
众所周知，应用安装包的体积会十分影响用户的应用下载速度和安装速度。据 GooglePlay 平台对外发布相关的包大小对转化率影响的数据，我们可以看到随着包大小的增加，安装转化率总体呈下降的趋势。

因此对于我们的应用来说，为了提升我们用户下载的转化率（即下载安装激活用户与潜在用户的比例），我们对包体积必须给予一定的优化和管控。
我们应用商店中提供给用户下载的安装包，是 Android 定义的 APK 格式，其实质则是一个包含应用所有所需资源的 zip 包，它包含了如下所示的几个组成部分：

这其中最主要的组成部分便是 DEX 文件，它们都是由 Java/Kotlin 代码编译而成。过去的两年中，抖音的 DEX 的个数从 8 个涨到了 21 个，DEX 的总大小从 26M 涨到了 48M，增长十分迅猛。诚然，随着抖音的快速发展，业务复杂度的提高，代码量级一定是在增加的，但如何在业务无感的情况下，对代码进行通用优化，也是我们一个很重要的优化方向。
在介绍具体优化手段之前，我们首先需要了解下针对 DEX 整体上的优化思路。
DEX 通用优化思路
在 AGP 的构建过程中，Java 或 Kotlin 源代码在经过编译之后会生成 Class 字节码文件，在这个阶段 AGP 提供了 Transform 来做字节码的处理，我们非常熟悉的 Proguard 就是在这个阶段工作的，之后 Class 文件经由 dexBuilder 生成一堆较小的 DEX 文件，再经由 mergeDex 合并成最终的 DEX 文件，然后打入 APK 中。具体过程如下图所示：

因此，我们针对 DEX 文件的优化时机可以从分别从三个阶段切入，分别是.kt 或.java 源文件、class 文件、DEX 文件：
在源文件进行处理也就是手…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[孩子们可以使用 Linux 发行版吗？它又是否适合学校使用呢？

嗯，这取决于你有什么选择，以及你想选择的是什么。不管你是想给孩子还是学校老师用，都有不少选择。

因此，为了给你一个良好的开端，我们策划了一个为教育量身定做的 最佳 Linux 发行版 列表。

最适合儿童的 Linux 发行版

对于一个孩子来说，发行版必须提供一个用户友好的用户界面，而不是高级功能。

你可能会说，任何主流的、像 Ubuntu、Mint 或 Zorin 这样适合初学者的发行版都可以做到这一点。没错，但是如果一个发行版带有了 基本工具 并易于使用，孩子们会很快学会使用它并喜欢上它。

1、Endless OS



Endless OS 是一个流行的选择，是为教育量身定做的 Linux 发行版。

它以 Debian 为基础，使用 GNOME 桌面环境。尽管它限制了一年内在超过 500 台电脑上使用其操作系统，但它是免费下载的。

它的用户界面很容易使用，看起来很有吸引力，适合安装在现代电脑上。你可以得到各种预装的应用程序。因此，这对没有互联网接入的电脑来说是很方便的。

2、Ubermix



Ubermix 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版，旨在通过调整用户界面，摆脱不必要的应用程序，以及增加用于教育的必要工具/应用程序来降低复杂性。

它还提供了一种方法，在出现问题的情况下可以轻松地从系统问题中恢复。在内容过滤和 屏幕时间控制 方面有一个可选的家长控制功能，这确实很有用。

Ubermix 得到了积极的维护，并在其官方网站上提供了大量关于安装和故障排除的说明。

3、Kano OS（用于树莓派）



Kano OS 是为 6 至 14 岁的儿童教育而量身定做的计算套件。它就像高级版的树莓派，为年轻人提供了大量的 DIY 和编码活动…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[leviathan0992: 
接上条 2022 年，现在的黑苹果解决方案是什么?
.
分析了一波后, 自己在淘宝花了 2000 买了一个 mini 主机 i7-8750H 不带内存和硬盘, 在 JD 买了两条威刚的 8G 内存条(500) 和一个 500G 的三星 Nvme 硬盘(500), 合计 3000 元左右配了一台黑苹果, 本来想自己装系统，结果教程第一步就失败, 后来索性又花 120 在淘宝找了店家远程安装的黑苹果, 目前使用一切正常.
旧笔记本就闲置下来, 想把它改造成一个家用小服务器. 比起目前云厂商买的小服务器, 笔记本的配置还算可以. 云厂商买的低配轻量服务器, 除了部署博客以外别的什么也干不了, 加之前两天自己根据 huggingface 上机器学习的模型写了一个英汉互译的 RESTful 服务, 本来打算部署在公网上直接通过 alfred workflow 来使用结果发现连安装 pytorch 都会 OOM. 索性尝试把闲置的笔记本利用起来.
我的需求就是在笔记本部署一些简单的 TCP 服务可以直接暴露在公网使用, 或者能 SSH 上去编译 kernel 模块, 找了一圈内网穿透的工具, 配置使用都略带繁琐, 所以自己写了一个轻量级的内网穿透工具: spleen.
通过在一台具有公网 IP 的小型服务器(阿里云轻量)部署 spleen 进行转发, 可以随时随地访问(闲置笔记本)的 TCP 服务, 例如 SSH, HTTP/S 等.
公网服务器部署 spleen-server
# 配置端口转发规则
> vim .server.json

{
  "ServerIP"   : "0.0.0.0",  # 公网服务器监听地址
  "ServerPort"   : 1234,  # 公网服务器监听端口, 该端口用来与家庭服务器 /内网主机建立通信隧道
  "MappingPort" : [ # 端口映射规则
"5000:22",  # 即访问公网服务器的 5000 端口就等于访问家庭服务器 /内网主机的 22 端口
"5001:3306"
...
  ]
}

# 启动
> ./spleen-server -c .server.json


家庭服务器 /内网主机部署 spleen-client
./spleen-client -c .client.json

例如 SSH 服务, 在顺利部署 spleen 的客户端和服务端后, 通过公网服务器(假定 IP 为 1.1.1.1), 可以直接通过端口映射来连接闲置笔记本:
执行 ssh -p 5000 user@1.1.1.1 # 即可直接连接到家庭服务器 /内网主机

TODO
目前仅支持 TCP 服务转发, 下一步重点是安全性的提升, 后面会根据自己的需求考虑加入 UDP 服务转发.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1，背景
最近开发了一个新的App，前期工期紧，做的比较粗放，上线以后发现App启动时间比较长，达到3秒，
启动有白屏，体验也不好，这个只能后期优化了，最好是前期开发就考虑的
2，调研
2.1,Android中启动的方式
1，冷启动：如果App启动时，后台没有该应用进程，那么系统会重新创建一个进程分配给该应用，这种启动方式就是冷启动
2，热启动：如果App启动时，后台有该应用进程，那么系统就是直接使用已有进程
从两种启动方式的含义就可以看出，冷启动比较耗时，热启动一般比较快，我们要做的启动优化一般做的就是冷启动优化
2.2,冷启动流程

系统创建应用进程时间我们一般无法优化，这个是系统创建简单的流程

我们可以优化的地方就是
1，Application
2，SplashActivity
3，MainActivity
2.3,启动时间
1，通过命令
adb shell am start -W [packageName]/[packageName.MainActivity]

这个时候，如果启动的activity在Manifest中没有设置export:true，可能无法通过命令打开，需要设置这个
2，自己埋点
从上面的启动过程就可以知道，Android冷启动，系统要先创建一个进程，然后创建Application，我们可以在Application的attachBaseContext方法中开始埋点，这个埋点没有统计到系统创建进程的时间，但是这个过程，我们很难优化
/**
* 统计冷启动各个时间点的耗时

早先有这个想法，虽然有点鸡肋但是来了兴趣也就做了。不知道这种方式会不会更稳定，可能也会有觉得方便或者不方便的，看大家的需求了。
原理很简单，流量入口服务器对内外提供代理端口，对公网提供供流量出口服务器连接的端口，流量出口服务器只要有流量入口服务器的信息，就可以随时连接为流量入口服务器作为备用代理。
连接使用的是 HTTP2 ，需要配置 TLS 证书。

When you walked into the room at that party in the East Village, I felt my heart drop. Yes, you were a little out there, a bit all over the map, but you were stunning; a beautiful mess that I couldn’t take my eyes off.

You have two options here: clone the project repository or start with a blank Next.js project. If you go with a fresh project, install react-query and configure a QueryClientProvider in _app.js like shown in the documentation. React-query looks scary at first but believe me, it will save you tons of time later.

本文描述的虚拟机内存管理优化方案，是从应用侧视角对 Android 虚拟机内存管理进行改造，优化了虚拟机对 LargeObjectSpace 的内存管理策略，间接增加其它内存空间使用上限。改造后的方案，32 位运行环境 LargeObjectSpace 的内存使用上限可达到 2G 甚至更多（64 位环境使用上限理论上会趋于无限大）。通过本方案可以最大程度上从系统侧解决诸多应用都会遇到的内存瓶颈和 OOM 问题，一键接入，安全可靠。
1.背景
Java OOM对于 Android 开发者来说并不陌生，随着应用愈发复杂，部分业务在设计之初为了更好的产品体验，往往会考虑用空间换时间，长此以往，有限的内存资源将会不堪重负，尤其是在一些重大活动期间，内存挑战会更加严峻，稍有不慎就会暴雷。
为了应对这种情况，开发同学往往会从应用层面进行优化，减少缓存，但随着产品持续迭代，内存问题始终如达摩克利斯之剑，让应用处于崩溃的边缘。好在 Android 系统维护人员也意识到了这种问题，从 Android O 系统开始，对 Java 内存管理策略进行了调整，重点包括实例化 Bitmap 对象时，Bitmap 源数据的内存不再通过虚拟机申请，而是直接在 Native 层申请和管理，因此这部分内存不会纳入虚拟机 Heap 内存统计，以此来减少 LargeSpace 的占用，进而间接增加了其他内存空间的实际使用范围（此消彼长的关系），如下示意图：

通过调整 Bitmap 的内存管理策略以减少虚拟机整体内存使用，的确带来了立竿见影的效果。以字节公司内部诸多 App 为例，Android O 之后的移动设备，Java OOM 远远低于早期的系统版本。
2.思考与破局
对于上述 Android 内存管理策略优化，可以看到其实只有 Android N 以上版本受益，但是市面上仍有大…]]></summary>

Nearly every programming language provides a way for us to develop a simple web server, such as Express.js, Go Gin or Python Flask. However, with the advent of serverless computing, we need to rethink some of the fundamentals of how APIs are developed and deployed. Chiefly:
Traditionally APIs are packaged into one deliverable; serverless architecture encourages to divide solutions up into many smaller units that are packaged and deployed individually.
Traditionally APIs are stateful applications that are started and stopped infrequently; serverless architecture encourages to start up compute tasks only on demand.

我搜了搜，好像 5.x 的基本没有，偶尔有也是只能走音频，而且一对话音质就下来了。音频、数据都能走的只有 4.0 的。请问有人知道 5.0 以上好使的吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文翻译自 👉Staggered animations，是官方给出的最后一个动画教程——交错动画。看完本篇让你的动画不再单一，可以在淡入的过程中让尺寸变大，可以在尺寸变化的同时让形状变化。
本篇的内容
交错动画可以是一个前后衔接的动画序列，也可以是重叠在一起的动画效果
交错动画的创建需要使用多个 Animation 对象，这些动画对象的控制只有一个
每一个动画对象都需要指定一个 Interval，来表明该动画在整个动画序列的起止时刻
使用 Tween 来创建每一个动画
交错动画是一个很直接的概念：页面上的动画效果是一系列的动画，而不是一个动画一个动画手动加上去的。动画可能是纯粹的系列动画，动画之间前后衔接。也可能动画之间部分或者完全的重叠。也可能是空白动画，啥也没发生。
本篇就介绍如何在 Flutter 中构建交错动画。
案例
本篇文章使用基本的交错案例，更复杂的案例可以参考staggered_pic_selection。
basic_staggered_animation
staggered_pic_selection
我们完成的效果是这样的：

交错动画的基本结构
所有的动画都是被同一个 AnimationController 驱动的
不管动画持续的时间，controller 的值必须在0-1的闭区间。
每一个动画都有一个 0-1 闭区间 的Interval 的值
单个的动画叫做 interval ，每一个 interval 创建一个 Tween ，Tween 指定了开始
Tween 会创建动画并且动画由 controller 管理
下图演示了代码示例中 Interval 的使用，需要注意到以下的几点:
透明度的改变占据了整个动画时长的10%
透明度动画和宽度动画之间有一个小小的空档期
在时间线的最后25%的时间内没有任何动画
Padding动画和高度变化动画是完全重…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[明明已经毕业了，买火车票的时候还是每次都弹出来「是否购买学生票」的选项，甚至有时候就因为这一两秒耽搁，票就抢没了，上网搜半天都找不到一个靠谱的办法，但这次，我终于发现了正确的设置流程，年关将近，希望能为大家抢票节省一点时间。
首先，在12306里进入「我的」页面，点击「乘车人」，找到自己的名字后点击最右边的修改按钮，如果是自己的账户，一般都在第一行的当前用户里。

接着，点击右上角的「修改」，然后拖动到最后一行，你会发现这里写着「学生」，点击这里。下图中写着成人是因为我自己的账户已经改过了。

最后，把学生切换成成人，输入12306的密码和验证码后，点击「完成」即可，从此以后买票就再也不会弹出「是否购买学生票」的选项了。

害，我真是忍不住了，要 Code Review 我能理解（已经在求助大家有没有提效的方案了），但还要求写注释和文档，说是为了方便知识共享和新人入职。
WTF ？也不看看我们的业绩压力，万一不巧被裁下个月就去喝西北风了，新人关我 P 事。
索性吐槽一下看看大家想法：
我经历过小中大厂，经历的大部分代码是没有注释的，某些写得像屎山的代码，看起来十分费劲，重构不好还要挨刀子背锅，被骂出 bug
我花力气看懂了，好心写了注释，好像也没人关心？老板也不怎么来 code review ，都是同事之间+1 和 LGTM ，感觉我吃力不讨好
我发现其他人写的 bug ，我都是飞书告诉他要修掉或者我自己默默修掉了，如果我再和老板说 xxx 的代码有问题，感觉有点像背后捅一刀？给老板感觉也不好，为了鸡毛蒜皮的事情邀功？
之前在一家外企用那破 Confluence 让我抓狂，现在公司用飞书文档体验好了，但维护起来麻烦啊，代码更新了 Readme 和文档也要更新
年底了，就问问大家，大家写文档和注释有年终奖不？（逃…
正经时间：
其实我打心底觉得写文档和注释是个好习惯，毕竟咱们是靠代码吃饭的，但在公司内部有业绩压力有时候是心有余力不足，况且好多时候工具和代码是割裂的。
因此我正在写一个 VSCode 的插件，做一款基于代码的协作和知识分享，而不是现在基于文档（ README 、飞书等）。
就目前而言，我希望先实现：
在代码仓库里写注释的时候，如果看到有价值的信息，可以在 IDE 里同步到飞书文档 /Github 的 Readme 里等（这块还在想）
IDE 里顺手创建一个 Github/Gitlab issue ，再分配给我的同事（这个已经在做）
同步消息到飞书群 /钉钉群大家都能看到，显得我中立一点不要像是个打小报和为了这件事打报告的人
老板，咱们有锅背锅，有功拿奖行不行。
不知道大家是否感兴趣？如果感兴趣的话留个联系方式，等我开发完之后发给大家做 beta 测试。也可以给我提点意见。
真是难为我这个写 Golang 的后端，每天下班后啃前端代码（不说了，去写了...
附带效果：
选择代码块

在插件上写个标题就能创建一个 Github Issue]]></summary>

待遇:  ~ - 15 (一般来说 13-15 ) - 看你的情况决定咯
因为是小公司，公司给到的工资可能最多 13 - 15
岗位性质: 前端 (vue 2 、vue 3) - 未来 react 、react-native 或者 flutter 
可能目前只招一人
加班情况: 无 (一般来说我最多晚走 30 分钟, 6.30, 没什么大事的话，7 点走光了, 有大事也是因为开会而不是开发问题)
公司情况: 开发人员比较少，公司人员也比较少，比较和谐，不会有任何压抑和压力的情况，工作内容视你自己安排的情况决定，秉持原则：先上线 - 再优化 ，下班基本不会有任何打扰你的情况，除非很急的事情 
是一家在线教育招聘平台，名称先不说了，我们主要是挣老外的钱和 B 端用户的钱
我们希望您
(这里的不列很厉害的技术)
- vue
- 原生 js
- 能独立开发能力 ( 不是要你独立开发，大家一起干 )
- 能良好沟通和理解需求的能力 （不要闷闷的）
- 能够主动学习，善于学习 (就是对目前的技术方向 敏感一点，主动去了解 - 面了许多人，都这不懂那不懂的，只会 vue ，这样的就不好了)
- 对一些没用过的技术有兴趣，并且有主动学习的能力 - 例如不仅仅局限于 前端的 vue jquery ，可能 react  或者其他的
因为我们和招聘平台是竞争关系，招不到人所以来这里了，如有打扰，感谢理解~~~
希望你能拿出匹配你工作年限的水平，我们公司比较人文主义，生活大于工作 ，不止于你~]]></summary>

阿联酋迪拜，2022 年 1 月 12 日 -- AXL INU （$AXL AXL Token），一个在以太坊链（ ETH ）和币安智能链（ BSC ）上拥有智能路由的去中心化生态系统，在万众瞩目下宣布推出其 AXL 代币发行平台和质押协议。平台更宣布将于 2022 年 1 月 19 日在领先的 MEXC Global 交易所上市，为 2022 年打开好兆头。
AXL Inu 在快速成长下，成功获得了 210 万美元；并在 NFTb 上成功地 IDO （首次数字资产发行），成为 Bitmart 上最快的 IEO （首次交易所发行）之一，预售景况空前热烈。
AXL 是终极的 DEX （去中心化交易所）平台，并与数字所有权平台 NFTb 协作，向社区引荐以$AXL 和$NFTB 为层级代币的 AXL 发行平台。AXL 将能够使 AXL 发行平台与 NFTb 社区联系起来，确保 AXL 生态系统得到最大程度的认可，并有更多机会参与处于发展早期阶段的新兴项目。AXL Pad 将帮助创新的新项目向市场上推出。
AXL 不停地努力支持、培育和促进新项目的上市，将有不少令人耳目一新的即将上市项目预计将在不久后披露。该发行平台可让发展中的创意企业向社区公布他们的理念，并同时获得支持、关注和融资。
IDO 平台的特点
AXL 发行平台
AXL 发行平台可使用任一货币作为分级代币，让其他项目拥有自己的发行平台。发行方只需要施行一个智能合约，则整个层级结构将成为自有的代币。
最初的层级代币将由两种币组成：$AXL 和$NFTB 。
AXL 发行平台层级系统
发行平台层级机制的配置方式是，拥有较高额的$AXL 和$NFTB 持有人，能够享受额外的益处。
在层级系统中，每种代币皆有 3 个层级。

所有奖励将以$AXL 币发放。

打印机厂商的主要利润来源于耗材，因而在打印机上设置了 DRM 硬件锁，以阻止用户使用第三方耗材（比如墨水 / 粉盒）。然而在全球芯片供应短缺的大环境下，佳能似乎陷入了一个相当尴尬的境地 ，使用了新的替代芯片的原装耗材不能被自家打印机正确识别。无奈之下，该公司被迫教客户如何 绕过原厂 DRM 保护：请无视“检测到非原装耗材”的所有故障警告，直接点击关闭按钮，然后就可继续执行打印。


老王点评：这真是一件尴尬的事情。

印度的一个黑客组织 Patchwork 主要是攻击巴基斯坦。在 2021 年 11 月底至 12 月初的最新活动中，Patchwork 利用恶意 RTF 文件投放了一个远程管理木马。令人讽刺的是，该木马 感染 了他们自己的电脑，从而让安全公司 Malwarebytes 收集到了他们电脑和虚拟机的按键和屏幕截图。研究人员发现了该组织开发的基础框架，包括运行 Virtual Box、VMware 作为 Web 开发及测试环境，其主机有英文及印度文双键盘配置等。


老王点评：这是脚本小子级别的黑客组织吧。




感染勒索软件后，连锁酒店改用 Chrome OS 操作系统

一家斯堪的纳维亚连锁酒店上个月遭受勒索软件攻击，使员工无法访问客人的预订数据，也无法向新到的客人发放钥匙卡。但该酒店没有与黑客联系，也没有为解锁受感染设备的解密密钥进行谈判。该酒店表示，它采取了一种 新的方法，“在不到 24 小时内，第一家酒店就在 Chrome OS 生态系统中运行了。而在接下来的两天里，整个公司有 2000 台电脑的系统被转换，包括五个不同国家的 212 家酒店。”接下来他们还会迁移 2000 台电脑，这将预计可以节省 670 万美元。


老王点评：问题是，如果没有合理的 IT 管理体系，迁移到 Chrome OS 也不能避免再次被勒索啊。]]></summary>

最近工作中经常需要对一些比较大的开源项目进行编译，打包，一次十几分钟，着实等不起，关键是平时正常使用，切换程序，写代码时卡顿比较严重。实在忍不了。
某天晚上，辗转反侧，于是第二天去找领导，表达了公司办公电脑性能低下，希望使用自己的电脑的想法。
如果领导同意，就准备下单 16 寸 M1 Pro ，奈何领导直接拒绝。然后峰回路转，询问公司 IT 部门，居然有 14 寸 M1 Pro 可以更换，果断发邮件申请，二十分钟拿到。
然后，我特么吹爆 M1 Pro.
1,性能真的强，切换应用，码代码丝般顺滑，再也不会影响心情了。同一个 maven 项目，之前的 19 款 i5 要 12 分钟，M1 Pro 4 分 20 秒完成
2,风扇没听到转过，机身一片冰凉。一度以为坏的。
3,屏幕够靓。
4,整机重是重了点，然后风格也没之前那么有设计感，不过毕竟是拿来干活的东西，效率决定一切吧。
5,续航很强
最后，被领导骂了。因为组内的其他孙子也嗷嗷叫着发邮件申请换电脑。。。。。]]></summary>

        <id>827889</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/827889"/>
        <updated>2022-01-12T11:48:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CloudStorage: 
前言
随着业务规模的不断扩大，企业越来越重视构建高性能、高可用的大型分布式系统。为了解决应用耦合，合理进行流量削锋，腾讯云提供了包括 CKafka 和 TDMQ 在内的一系列消息队列中间件。为了更方便地对消息队列中的数据进行转存和持久化，腾讯云对象存储 COS 为用户提供了云消息队列备份的能力。
一、云消息队列备份方案-使用 COS 应用集成备份
COS 应用集成 是腾讯云对象存储 COS 基于 Serverless 云函数，为开发者提供的存储数据应用解决方案。开发者只需要在 COS 控制台一键配置，即可使用丰富的功能。
COS 应用集成提供了云消息队列备份的能力，开发者可以轻松配置定时备份任务，将云消息队列中的消息记录以文件的形式转至对象存储，以便进行持久化保存。开发者可以通过备份文件提取消息记录，对消息进行入库、统计分析等操作。

二、方案优势
存储成本低：对象存储支持数据归档和降冷，长期存储成本低；
可视化操作：一键配置，简化开发流程，无需编码工作；
指定范围：可指定消费的起始位置，排除不需要的记录；
消息聚合：可按分钟维度聚合消息记录，并支持修改时间粒度；
自动化执行：云函数自动完成云消息队列 CKafka / TDMQ 的数据备份，中间过程无需任何人工操作；
三、云消息队列介绍
**消息队列 **CKafka （ Cloud Kafka ）是一个分布式、高吞吐量、高可扩展性的消息系统，100%兼容开源 Kafka API 0.9.0 至 2.8.0 版本。CKafka 基于发布订阅模式，通过消息解耦，使生产者和消费者异步交互，无需彼此等待。CKafka 具有数据压缩、支持离线和实时数据处理等优点，适用于日志压缩收集、监控数据聚合等场景。
**消息队列 TDMQ **（ Tencent Distributed Message Queue ）是腾讯基于 Apache Pulsar 自研的一个云原生消息中间件系列，其中包含兼容 Pulsar 、RabbitMQ 、RocketMQ 等协议的消息队列子产品，得益于其底层计算与存储分离的架构，TDMQ 具备良好的弹性伸缩以及故障恢复能力。
四、备份任务设置步骤
这里以设置 CKafka 消息备份任务为例，TDMQ 设置与之相似：
登录腾讯云 对象存储 COS 控制台。
在左侧导航中，单击 [应用集成] ，找到 [ CKafka 消息备份] 。
单击 [配置备份规则] ，进入规则配置页面。
单击 [添加函数] 。注意：如果您尚未开通云函数服务，请前往 云函数控制台 开通云函数服务，按照提示完成服务授权即可。
在弹出的窗口中，配置如下信息：

a.函数名称：作为函数的唯一标识名称，创建后不可修改（您可以在云函数控制台上查看该函数）。
b.关联存储桶：存放 CKafka 消息的 COS 存储桶。
c.时间粒度：根据消息量的大小，选取汇聚消息的时间间隔，时间间隔为 5 - 15 分钟不等。为保证转存性能，聚合文件数量与 Partition 数量、partition_max 设置数值有关。有关 Partition 的说明，请参见分区。
d.SCF 授权：CKafka 消息备份需要授权云函数从您的 CKafka 服务中读取相关实例消息，并将消息转存至您指定的存储桶中。因此需要添加此授权。
6.单击 [下一步] ，进行 CKafka 配置，配置项说明如下：

a.实例选择：选择消息来源的 CKafka 实例，仅支持同地域的 CKafka 实例。
b.主题选择：选择消息来源的主题。
c.起始位置：消息转储备份时历史消息的处理方式，topic offset 设置。
d.访问地址：必须为 VPC 内网访问地址，基础网络的 CKafka 实例请添加路由策略，具体请参考 添加路由策略。注意：对应的 VPC 子网中必须有可用的 IP ，且必须支持 DHCP 。
7.单击 [下一步] ，进行投递配置，配置项说明如下：

a.投递的路径：备份文件的投递路径前缀，不填写则默认保存在存储桶根路径，指定前缀必须以斜杠 “ / ” 为结尾。
8.添加配置后，单击 [确认] ，即可看到函数已添加完成。

五、查看备份文件
等待一段时间后，可以看到存储桶下投递了备份文件，其内容的每行代表一条消息记录。

结论：
预算充足：能上 6GB 就上 6GB ，使用体验好太多
3GB：对重度 APP 使用用户来说非常不够用
4GB：估计会和 iPhone 11 一起被淘汰…只能说不太建议
启动广告：毒瘤，科学上网工具干之，不然真的再快的手机都要被折腾…
----太长不看---
现在：升级 6GB

场景：微信聊天

场景：看测评、比价和购物
6GB vs 8GB：尝试打开昨天观看的 bilibili：
当然，不排除因为 iPad 相对 iPhone 强度还是偏低，所以内存负荷不高（其实不低，有时候美团、饿了么、叮咚买菜、下厨房等等一堆 APP 我会切来切去）；目前看，8GB 非常能打
不是很全的 iPhone 内存统计：
6G：iPhone 12 Pro Max 、iPhone12 Pro 、iPhone 13 Pro 、iPhone 13 Pro Max
钉子户 1：iPhone 6S （甚至能和 8 一起换手机）
参考末尾视频，4GB 已经成为瓶颈。严格来说，5000 价位的（ 8G RAM 起）竞争对手+自动跳过之类 APP ，仅 APP 后台使用体验上，应该能完胜 4GB RAM 的 iPhone 12 和 iPhone 13 
最后：我还是要说一句垃圾低频 PWM 调光。从来选择手机裸奔的我，默默套上手机壳，希望少亏几百明年可以换虚无缥缈的高频 PWM 调光 iPhone 14 Pro 系列。
附第三方对比参考，4GB 严重杀后台：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在CES 2022上，索尼公开了第二款概念车VISION-S 0 SUV，而且索尼董事长、总裁兼首席执行官吉田健一郎宣布索尼集团将成立新的部门——索尼移动公司（Sony Mobility Inc），该公司预计在今年春季成立，主要专注于电动汽车商业化。


Vision-S 02由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队打造，看着看着，这可能成为走向一个新型电动汽车公司的方向么？


备注：造车这个事情，戴森走了一轮没走下去。


▲图1.Sony的Vision S两款概念车






Part 1
Vision S系列的重点


这款概念车是索尼Vision-S由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队来牵头的（机器狗产品Aibo），并且还拉着好几家其他公司来做，包括：NVIDIA、高通、采埃孚、博世（很多部件）、黑莓、QNX、Conti（大量的开发ECU）、本特勒（底盘和电池）、麦格纳（整个EE设计）等等。这个系列最大的特色，还是Vision-S车身内外部署了一套完整的、面向高阶自动驾驶的传感器套件，目的是提供全景影像、360音效、全时连接等特性。


Sony Vision上的40 个传感器分为：
16 个 Camera：分为外部8个，分别是环视 4个（IMX390）、侧后摄像头2个（IMX390*2）+、侧视2个（IMX490*2）、内部8个，分别为两个前视立体相机（IMX490*2）、两个ToF 相机（IMX456*2）、驾驶员监控*1、行车记录*1、后摄像头和内部电子个1个、18 个超声波/雷达传感器和 4 个 LiDAR 传感器。





▲图2.Sony 的Vision S


而这台索尼Vision-S的原型车，已经在奥地利参加了公开的路面测试。
从逻辑上，这是所有参与整个系统构建的一个技术演示，围绕5G技术，可以把诸多感知的电子技术，通过车载系统和云端之间实现高速、高容量和低延迟的连接。也就是说，通过索尼，合作的小伙伴们把VIsion-S打造为一种移动的娱乐空间。
对于Sony而言，最重要的是需要一个展示的渠道，把Sony在内容、游戏体验和音频上体现出来。通过对VIsion-S的探索，以及合作伙伴的支持，在“移动娱乐空间”这个方向可以有了更多的发展空间。


我们仔细研究Sony的业务构成，就能发现索尼已经变成一个围绕游戏机、内容（音乐+电影）的公司。传统上，我们对sony的认知，电子产品只占了1/4不到的业务，而图像传感器CIS是很重要的一块业务。





▲图3.Sony FY21 Q2的业务构成


也就是说，概念车所隶属的Electronics Products & Solutions这个部门，现在已经是一个独立的业务部门。
从这个意义上来看，Sony和现在苹果的公司结构不一样。苹果可以围绕Apple Car（据说最近苹果抽调了很多资源去做AR和元宇宙了）不停撒钱；Sony肯定和戴森一样烧钱，成立这个业务部门做什么呢？





▲图4.索尼的概念车隶属于一个小部门





Part 2
Sony的CIS和激光雷达


在Sony科技日展示的内容里面，很重要的一部分就是激光雷达：





▲图5.索尼的激光雷达视频


有一个重要的背景是，Sony到现在的CIS业务中，在汽车市场里面的占比很低。可以说，索尼的图像传感器CIS部分的新业务开拓，目前还局限在日本车企部分使用，索尼是想通过ADAS领域的需求，能够把自己在移动领域的优势发挥出来。





▲图6.后疫情时代索尼对于CIS的预测


在Vision S系列里面，最多的还是摄像头——这些东西可以作为一个展示给全球汽车企业的方案，并在这个细分市场对安森美进行超越。





▲图7.Sony的优势CIS领域在汽车里面没做起来



▲图8.Sony的图像传感器在汽车领域的应用


而且一旦有了这个平台，在各项业务和内容中，可以比较容易找到合作伙伴，特别是Sony较少接触的OEM的直接需求——我个人判断这个才是重点，眼下自己去做个汽车公司，完全是得不偿失的事情。





▲图9.汽车使用的图像传感器，Sony起步较晚



小结：我个人判断，除了中国和美国，传统欧洲和日本很难出现创业汽车公司，而这两个地方也没有所谓的软件巨头，戴森和Sony这样做产品的公司进入汽车行业也很难赢。
我想下一步就ADAS摄像头和汽车CIS这个市场进行打开分析，可能效果好一些。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如今，Apple 全系的 Mac 产品都已经跨入了高分辨率屏幕，最新款的 MacBook Pro 甚至还采用了 mini-LED 技术和 ProMotion 自适应刷新率，为我们带来了笔记本上「天花板级别」一般的显示体验。
但和 Mac 上高水准的屏幕不同的是，不少人还在用 2K 甚至 1080P 级别的屏幕，忍受着大果粒和小字体带来的麻烦。尽管 Mac 上也有屏幕分辨率调整的选项，但与 Windows 不同的是，Mac 官方仅支持 4K 分辨率以上的屏幕缩放，而 Windows 不仅可以支持各种显示器，还可以自定义缩放的倍数。这也而就意味着，1080P 和 2K 分辨率的显示器，在 Mac 上是无法进行原生的 HiDPI 缩放的，想要实现原生系统级的 HiDPI 支持，最低的条件必须是 4K 显示器。

关于 HiDPI 是什么，这里不再展开介绍，感兴趣的朋友可以在其他地方学习。这里只提一点：即这套 HiDPI 逻辑和早年 Apple 在 Retina 视网膜显示屏开发时有着密不可分的关系。最早的 iPhone 4 实现视网膜显示屏的方式，就是将前代 iPhone 3GS 的 480×320 像素乘以 2，翻倍到了 960×640，并用四个像素渲染一个像素，实现了逻辑分辨率的一致。
在后来，Apple 一些非视网膜屏幕的产品在升级视网膜屏幕后，也依旧沿用了这个逻辑。例如老款的 MacBook Pro 从 1280×800 升级到视网膜屏幕之后的物理分辨率就变成了 2560×1600，经过 2 倍 HiDPI 缩放之后就和原来的 MacBook Pro 的逻辑分辨率一致了。

在 Intel 时代，我们可以通过一些脚本来实现在 2K 屏幕上的 HiDPI 缩放，以获得更加清晰锐利的显示效果。然而到了 Apple 芯片的 Mac 上，这个方法却失效了。如果想要开启系统的 Hi…]]></summary>

需要定期从 A、B、C 等多个网页里搜集数据填写到 Excel 里面，或者相反，从 Excel 里面定期找数据填写到网页的表单。
一次性收集数百份 Word 表单，需要汇总表单中信息到 Excel，或者相反，根据一份 Excel 表格中的信息填写模板生成不同的 word 文件(比如合同)。
每天都需要在几个地方导出数据，简单处理后邮件发给其他人。
定期监测某些网页、软件的数据变化，发通知到企业微信/钉钉/飞书。
...

如果有的话，那么下面要谈到的微软出品的 Power Automate Desktop (后文将简称为：PAD)可能就会帮到你。
背景：RPA 工具与 PAD 关系
这部分不必强追概念区别，毕竟工具的最终目的还是能用，有用，好用。
RPA 是什么？
参考维基 的定义，RPA(Robotic process automation) 简单讲就是把需要在多个软件之间切换配合的工作流在不借助 API 或脚本的情况下，通过复制屏幕上的操作来完成自动化。
再直白一点，RPA 工具能做的，就是帮助你相对低成本地把工作流中重复性的、周期性的工作给自动化掉，降本增效。
RPA 工具的场景决定了它主要面向的是 to B 市场，里面既有 UiPath 这种敲钟新贵，也有微软这种老牌巨头。
PAD 是什么？

微软之前有一款和 iFTTT 和 Zapier 定位一致的云端自动化服务——Microsoft Flow，在决心进入 PRA 市场后，Microsoft Flow 就进化成了 Power Automate，有云端的流也有本地的流。
最开始的时候，Power Automate 仅对企业和教育用户开放订阅制授权，后来微软把本地版的软件对普通用户免费了，也就是本文提到的 PAD。所以 PAD 相较于完整的 Power Automate 服务…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当你 开始学习 Linux 时，最初学习的是一套标准的 Linux 命令，这些命令从 UNIX 时代就已经存在了。随着你作为一个 Linux 用户的年龄增长，你会不断地掌握这套标准命令。

但是，这些标准的、传统的命令是几十年前创建的，虽然它们完成了预定的工作，但是它们的功能还可以改进，结构还可以简化。

这就是为什么存在 “替代” 工具，以加强传统的 UNIX/Linux 命令。在这篇文章中，我将列出一些新的命令行工具，你可以用这些工具来代替旧式的经典 Linux 命令。

请注意，你不应该过分依赖这些替代品，特别是如果你管理（或计划管理）许多 Linux 服务器时。传统的 Linux 命令在所有的 Linux 发行版和 Linux 服务器上都可以找到。这些现代的替代方案很有可能在远程服务器上无法使用。

在你的个人能力范围内，你可以学习了解这些新的工具，以帮助你更有效率。

听起来不错？让我们看看你是否能在这里找到你下一个最喜欢的命令行工具。

HTTPie: wget 和 curl 的替代品

在终端下载文件 时，wget 和 curl 是两个最常用的工具。有趣的是，并不是所有的发行版都默认安装了 curl 和 wget。

HTTPie（http）以一种更人性化的方式做同样的工作。你会看到彩色的、格式化的输出，这使得它更容易理解和调试。



蝙蝠：猫的替代品

cat 命令可能是你最先学会的命令之一。它可以完成查看小型文本文件内容的工作。

但 bat 命令 更上一层楼，添加了语法高亮和 Git 集成等功能，并且还提供了分页选项。



ncdu: du 命令的替代品

Linux 中的 du 命令 用来检查一个目录的大小。这不是一个非常直观的命令，当然它的默认输出也不算非常好。

与此相比，ncdu 要好得多，它能及时提供相关信息…]]></summary>

最近正在和学生们一起准备期末复习，整个人忙得焦头烂额，午饭间隙看到这个话题，赶紧放下碗筷，忍不住想跟题主唠个知心嗑。你先别急，咱们慢慢来盘一下「回答问题」这件事，如果不想看分析，也可以直接拖到最后看策略。
一、作为老师，通常会选什么样的孩子回答问题？
在很多家长看来，老师上课时经常点孩子起来回答问题，是一桩喜事。的确，课堂参与度高的孩子，更容易集中注意力，如果回答正确的话，也很容易在老师的表扬和同学的钦佩中汲取自信的力量。
但一个教学经验丰富的老师，ta授课时选什么学生、选多少学生来回答问题并不是随意为之，而是是有规可循的，每个老师的「内心选生规则」可能不太一样，且以我个人为例，我的规则通常是：
1、如果我的提问非常简单和基础，我会找学习基础薄弱的学生先来回答。
这种情况下我的主要目的是想看看学困生掌握的情况，如果连他们都掌握很不错，那说明大概率上班级其他同学也都可以轻松get，那么，这一趴的学习内容可以快速过，抓紧进入下一趴；反之，如果点到的几位基础薄弱生在这个基础问题上都跌了跟头，我就要赶紧反思是不是我的预设有漏洞？是不是之前学相关知识的时候我没讲透彻？是不是这个问题还存在难度？那不能快速过，得再拿出时间详细讲一讲。
在此刻，学生回答问题的状态就是我的复盘晴雨表，帮助我来把握课堂授课的节奏。
2、如果我的提问非常刁钻和复杂，我会找学习能力强或敢于表达的学生先来回答。
当我在课堂上抛出一个难题时，大部分孩子是会有畏难心理的，「怕」字当头，思维就容易被束缚，这时，非常需要一个善于思考且敢于打破沉默的孩子，大胆回答，为其他同学「打个样儿」。如果回答得基本正确，作为老师我会给予肯定，而那些畏手畏脚不敢出头的同学也会因为榜样效应而开始积极参与，大胆地对这个孩子的回答进行补充；如果这个「先锋同学」的回答与正确答案相去甚远，那也非…]]></summary>

👊 Android 的 CES 2022「组合拳」

在本届 CES 开幕前，Google 也是宣布将不会参与 CES 2022 线下展会的那批厂商，但大家都知道如今大家都已经习惯了线上发布的节奏，新技术的发布节奏不会因为线上/线下而产生太大的调整。
不出意外，Google 在 CES 期间还是如愿发布了一大批 Android 相关的新技术：不只是 Android 本身，Google 本次 CES 中发布的新技术均以「协作」为主题，涉及到了 Android TV、WearOS、ChromeOS 与 Windows 几乎目前所有泛 Android 生态圈。先跟我们一起来看看具体涉及到的技术细节吧。
智能手表系统 WearOS 3 将加入在腕感应解锁功能；当手表本身处于解锁且戴在手腕上的状态时，与其连接的手机也可以直接解锁。

Fast Pair 也会登陆包括 Google TV 在内的 Android TV 电视平台，支援这一技术的耳机与音箱也可以更快的与电视配对，不过目前 Google 没有公布用于降低延迟或音频画面同步的相关的技术。

Fast Pair 功能也将在未来几周内支持检测到支持 Matter 协议的智能家居，同时支援这一协议的智能家居设备也可以扫描二维码直接链接到兼容的配…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[只谈技术。
一，UE as Lib。 首先表扬一下QQ团队的一点点技术实力。虽然UE4.27推出了UE as Lib功能(文档)，但依然只是Beta版本，且依然限制只在Windows平台和Single Viewport。因此这次QQ的IOS内嵌UE4应该是他们团队自己改造的。盲猜也可能是QQ团队也获得了其他QQ内部游戏团队的技术帮助，不过对于一个App团队能否拥抱最新的技术，应该给个赞。
二，期待之后的技术更新优化。实话讲，放进一个100多M的UE4.so，特别是对于QQ这种国民app来说，这个决策的背后肯定是有非常多的考量的。目前也只是刚刚整合进去，相信在技术优化上还有一些空间的，且在渲染展示的效果上也可以继续提高。相信QQ团队是有更大的愿景的，我们拭目以待就好。
三，给其他家的借鉴。QQ这种内嵌UE4的方式，说白了，就是在App内嵌一个3D渲染交互的功能，只不过UE4的渲染效果好一些，内容开发工具链完善一些，有源码改造便利一些，因此采用了UE4而已，这样就不需要自己再手动去开发3D的一系列功能。这种内嵌的模式，在移动App上目前还只是QQ先吃了螃蟹，未来可能还会有其他家。但在PC企业软件上，其实大家就完全可以尝试起来了，通过在自己的传统软件里内嵌UE4窗口的方式来做可视化效果的升级，同时也不需要重写自己的业务逻辑。以往的方式大家都往往纠结于如何在QT里内嵌UE4进程的窗口，但到现在利用UE as Lib的功能就可以更方便的开发了。
3D形态终将渗透到越来越多的领域，而这也是游戏引擎这种基础设施的作用所在。不说了，看代码去了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[机器学习方案将帮助不同的无线电协议，如 Wi-Fi 和 LTE，在同一的无线频谱中更有效地协同工作。




美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）开发的机器学习方案有可能显著改善 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率的方式。研究人员声称，与试错法相比，NIST 的方案可以使共享通信频率的过程的效率提高多达 5000 倍。

NIST 系统的理念是，无线电设备可以从经验中学习其网络环境，而不是像现在这样，简单地根据试错法选择频率信道。

NIST 在 其网站上的一篇文章 中说，在特定的环境条件下，“该算法可以学习哪个信道提供最好的结果”。

该团队说:“该方案可以被编程到现实世界中许多 [不同] 类型网络的发射机软件中。”

从本质上讲，这个计算机模拟的算法是一个映射环境射频条件的先前经验的公式。例如，这些条件可以包括在一个信道（一组相邻的频率）内运行的发射机的数量。

文章说：“……如果发射机选择了一个未被占用的信道，那么成功传输的概率就会上升，从而导致更高的数据速率。”同样地，当发射机选择一个没有太多干扰的信道时，信号会更强，你也会得到更好的数据速率。发射机会记住哪个信道提供了最佳结果，并学会在下次需要清晰信号时学会选择那个位置。

这与今天的工作方式不同。也就是说，无线电只是试图找到一个开放频率，然后与类似协议的无线电进行通信。在复杂的情况下，使用诸如 Wi-Fi、跳频和 波束成形 等技术来优化信道。

研究人员解释说，NIST 的机器学习技术的亮点在于共享频谱，比如通过授权频谱辅助接入（LAA）共享 Wi-Fi。LAA 是非授权频谱中的 LTE 频谱，称为 LTE-U，频率为 5GHz。在相同频率下的 Wi-Fi 与 LAA 的组合中，协议是不同的：无线电之间不能相互通信以协调工作，而且频带越繁忙就可能出现混乱 —— 传输会遇到其他传输。但是，如果所有的无线电接收机都能更好地选择它们的占位，通过学习哪些有效，哪些无效，那么这将会更好。

NIST 工程师 Jason Coder 在文章中说：“这可能会使非授权频段的通信更加高效。”

事实上，NIST 声称，它“可以帮助 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率，其效率大约是试错法的 5000 倍。”

这里的关键词是“共享”，因为为了在有限的频谱内增加通信，必须进行更多的共享 —— 物联网或媒体流等用户都在争夺同样的隐喻资产。随着物联网和数字技术的不断发展，非授权和授权频段的结合，就像 LAA 中的情况一样，可能会变得更加普遍。（非授权的频段是指那些没有分配给特定用户的频段，比如移动网络运营商；授权频段是在拍卖中中标并分配的。）

在 NIST 场景中，相互竞争的发射机“各自学习在不相互通信的情况下最大化网络数据速率”。因此，多种协议和数据类型，如视频或传感器数据，或 Wi-Fi 和移动网络，可以相互协作。

NIST 的方案大大简化了为发射机分配最佳信道的过程，根据这篇文章研究发现，穷尽努力 [使用试错法] 来确定最佳解决方案需要大约 45600 次试验，而这个方案只需要尝试 10 个渠道就可以选择类似的解决方案，仅仅付出 0.02% 的努力。”

NIST 的研究人员在 IEEE 第 91 届车辆技术会议上展示了他们的研究成果。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[█ 看点1：5G专网
2021年，是5G toB的发展元年。这一年，在政府的巨额资金支持下，在运营商和厂商的资源堆积下，各个行业都扶持了大量的5G标杆应用，例如5G工厂、5G码头、5G矿山等。


2022年的问题在于，如何将这些标杆项目进行低成本复制。


也就是说，如果国家不再砸钱，5G是否能靠自己的本事，活下去。运营商和厂商，从“重点保障单个项目”，到“普遍支撑N个项目”，是否还能搞得定。


5G toB的进一步推进，引发了人们对5G专网的关注。5G公网建设达到初步目标，专网是否会成为新的增长点？


其实，我们国家对专网的政策比较严格，对频谱资源控制得很紧，对于企业来说，自主建网基本上没有空间。而且，专网的技术门槛太高，建设和维护成本也高。所以，除了电力、石油、铁路等国有企业之外，大部分企业建设专网的动力和意愿并不强烈。


从技术的角度来看，5G的优势主要集中在时延和带宽，真正有需求的场景并不是很多。如果是自己掏钱建5G专网，大部分企业都会仔细掂量利弊。


我个人觉得，想要发展专网，仅靠资金扶持是不够的。还是要多考虑在政策、技术和频谱方面，能有所松绑，让企业有更多的选择权。我们不是为了5G建设专网，而是为了数字化转型建设专网。与其过于强调5G在专网中的角色，不如更多关注园区全光网络以及云网融合接入的重要性，通过云业务来带动用户对网的需求，刺激专网的建设。


█ 看点2： 毫米波的政策走向


还有1个月，北京冬奥会就要开幕。作为通信人，这届冬奥会，最值得关注的应该是毫米波的亮相和应用。


毫米波这个技术争议很大，很多人将其上升到政治层面。其实，这是没有必要的。从产业链的角度来说，中国同样是毫米波产业链的重要参与者和受益者。没有必要对一项技术进行排斥。


毫米波作为一项移动通信技术，其实没有大家想象得那么不堪。速率和覆盖是天平的两端，在不同的场景，各自有各…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上一篇文章我们对肥胖的标准、产生的原因、不良影响及如何树立正确减脂观等几方面内容进行了分析，本篇我们从：「吃」入手，我们常听人说减脂「七分吃，三分练」，「吃」在减脂中扮演的角色不容忽视，甚至可以说是决定性的，关于「吃」我尝试以「总-分」形式展开，也就是先从整体上建立正确的饮食及营养观，后续我们再从人体所需三大营养素（碳水化合物、蛋白质、脂肪）及维生素矿物质等微量元素的微观层面切入，最终建立较为立体的健康饮食观。
本篇，我们主要探讨两方面内容，第一是从减脂角度出发，我们日常应当摄入多少热量，也就是吃多少的问题；第二是从宏观出发，我们日常饮食结构应当如何构成，也就是怎么吃的问题。
一、吃多少？
（一）减脂期的我们，应当摄入多少热量？
在本系列上篇文章我们确立了以建立健康生活方式（营养搭配合理+适度运动）为核心的减脂观，也阐述了减脂应当是持久战，但归根结底，我们需要先把该死的脂肪减到合理（健康）程度。
根据能量守恒定律1，如果我们想要减脂，那么我们每日摄入热量需低于每日消耗热量，而每个人年龄、身高、体重及运动状况等情况不同，故每个人每日所需热量也是不同的，你们可以打开这个网址，在页面上输入年龄、身高、体重等指标，下方即可计算出「每日摄取建议值」中的「维持所需热量」大致就是你的 TDEE（Total Daily Energy Expenditure）。如下图是我本人的数据。

 
当你根据自身实际情况得出 TDEE 数据时，无论你每天吃什么，你每天摄入食物的热量都不应当超过 TDEE，当然不超过 TDEE 仅意味你的体型不会变化，想要减脂，每日摄入热量需要比 TDEE 数值更小，具体小到多少才合理，也就是说我们的热量缺口多大才合适？且看下文。
注：你可能说道理我都懂，但我们每日摄入食物热量从哪查，记在哪，我个人用的是 Keep，大家也可以再探索一下有没有其他更好的 APP，可以分享…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自从 Struggle with Me 开始关注记笔记这个话题， 我们经常收到朋友们关于如何记笔记的问题。粗略概括一下，这些问题大概分为三类：

我也试过记笔记，但是对我没什么帮助。记笔记到底有什么用呢？
我发现记笔记对我是有帮助的，但是很麻烦，效果也没有大家说得那么神奇。记笔记到底怎样才能简单又高效呢？
我看了不少人的笔记经验介绍都觉得特别好，但自己一用就觉得不顺手。怎样打造一套适合自己的简单又高效的笔记系统呢？

这篇文章就结合我们这几年记笔记的心得，简要地回答这几个问题。希望能帮到对记笔记有疑惑的朋友。
一、记笔记有什么用？
没用的笔记各有各的没用，有用的笔记只需做到两件事：收集和整理。收集帮助我们清空大脑，专注当下；整理帮助我们连接笔记，加速知识的积累和碰撞。
收集
收集，就是把我们所有的想法都捡起来放在一起。
我周边很多朋友都对收集自己的想法嗤之以鼻。大学的时候有一位朋友会在酒席饭桌上随时掏出笔记本来写两句。周围的人都笑他：你是天才嘛？有什么灵感必须这会儿记下来？这是好多人都有的思维误区。大家以为只有天才需要随时随地记笔记；因为只有天才才有灵感，而只有灵感才值得记录。其实，值得记下来的不仅仅是灵感。最需要记笔记的或许不是天才，而是我们这些普通人。
我们可以试着先问一下自己，忙碌的间隙，我们都想了些什么呢？好多人会说：「我在想今天吃什么。」没错，大脑就是天生的规划狂魔，无时不刻不在设想下一步该做什么。所以我们很多有意无意的想法都跟未来有关，包括但不限于计划、提醒、担心和问题。而所谓的灵感，通常只占其中很小的一部分。反倒是那些琐碎的计划、提醒、担心、问题等等占据了我们的大脑。只有把这些琐碎的念头都记下来，我们的大脑才能轻装上阵。
举两个啰嗦的例子做对比，方便大家明白。
例子一，没有收集想法的工作日上午。
早晨六点半，我醒来，开始查微信消息。国内已经是中午了，我看到 S…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[废话不多说，直接开始。
启动协程的时候，我们的基本写法是这样的：
lifecycleScope.launch { 
    
}

或者

viewModelScope.launch { 
    
}


这会存在一个问题，如果launch里面发生错误，会直接导致崩溃，这是不安全的。
1. 于是最笨的方法诞生了：
lifecycleScope.launch { 
    try {
    // 加个异常捕获
    } catch(e: Throwable) {
    }
}

问题解决了，但是并不优雅。每次launch的时候都要去写try也是很难受的。
2. 于是进阶方法诞生了，原型如下（各种变形不再列举）：
// 扩展方法
fun CoroutineScope.xxxLaunch(
    onError: ((Throwable) -> Unit)? = null,
    onLaunchBlock: () -> Unit
) {
    // 新增一个异常处理的 CoroutineContext
    val handler = CoroutineExceptionHandler { _, throwable ->
        onError?.invoke(throwable)
    }

    this.launch(handler) {
        onLaunchBlock.invoke()
    }
}

使用的时候就是这样：
lifecycleScope.xxxLaunch(
    onError = {

    },
    onLaunchBlock = {

    }
)

为了简单说明，直接传递了方法参数，DSL的使用是一样的，只是再封装了一层而已。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文|邻章
2019年11月11日，工业和信息化部发布了《携号转网服务管理规定》，并要求四大运营商于同年12月1日正式开始向全国提供服务。自此，我国用户也可视运营商的服务、资费、网络体验等表现，择优选择运营商。

但从实践来看，这种响应用户呼声，敦促运营商进一步提升服务，进一步激活市场竞争的好政策，却一度面临落地难的情况——各大运营商们虽然都表示将积极拥护携号转网规定，但在用户携号转网的实际操作过程中，却时常遇到各种条条框框的刁难，以至于多次让“携号转网有多难”登上热搜，而央视更是曾点名批评长沙联通携号转网套路。
如果说此前用户携号转网难，是由于规定刚刚落地，运营商需要时间进行政策理解、员工培训、技术升级、系统对接，从而导致用户在携号转网过程中遇到各种难题，似乎还算情有可原，我们也可以给运营商时间进行用户携号转网体验优化。
那么如今两年时间过去了，按理说运营商应该已经把携号转网的一切都理顺了，用户也可以畅通的进行携号转网了吧，但现实却并非如此。
以笔者亲身经历来看，目前一些运营商对用户携号转网依旧设置了较多的弯弯绕绕，并且在线下专员的业务对接中，业务员依旧在违反《携号转网服务管理规定》明确规定的一些不得违反的条款——诸如“拖延向用户提供携号转网服务、干扰用户自由选择、 在携号转网服务以及相关资费方案的宣传中进行比较宣传”等。
下面就是元旦节前笔者父亲在携号转网时，遇到的一些魔幻经历。
今年元旦节前，借着老家正在宽带入户的契机，父亲也想将其使用多年的移动卡携号转网，随宽带安装提升手机流量额度——毕竟随着移动互联网快速发展，即使是父亲这种不太依赖手机的用户，也被迫融入数字生活之中——毕竟当其他人都习惯了移动支付来进行工资结算时，你不使用又如何收款？更何况在防疫需求下，出行都需要查验健康码、行程码，手机卡没有足够的流量，自然是一件十分头疼的事情。
也正是基于此，我建议父亲在老家安装…]]></summary>

架构不是一蹴而就的，希望我们有一天的时候，能够从自己写的代码中找到架构的成就感，而不是干几票就跑路
Android架构学习之路系列
架构是什么
对于架构，我也有些一知半解，读了一些架构相关的文章，结合实际项目经历，有了自己的一些理解。
关于架构是什么？这点可以顾名思义去看，架构=架+构，即整体的一个架子和各个组件之间的组合结构。当然可能不同的程序员对于项目架构的风格和习惯不一样，但是底层的思想应该都是类似的，诸如我们可能听到起了茧子的“关注点分离”，“低耦合高内聚”，“可扩展可复用易维护”等等，听完这些话，感觉自己懂了，又感觉啥也不懂，好像有所收获了，准备开始写代码的时候，脑子里想的可能又是“工期太赶了，就这样写吧，反正干完这几票就跑路了”。
架构离我们并不远，反而在我们的实际开发中无处不在，它是一个很笼统的概念，上至框架选型，组件化等，下至业务代码，设计模式都能称为架构的一部分。对于架构学习而言，我觉得首先得对面向对象(抽象，继承，多态等)及设计原则有一定的理解，进而结合 Android 常用的一些架构如 MVVM, MVP, MVI 等思想，基础与理论理解清楚了，架构就在日常的开发中，多思考，多结合理论与实际，一点一点地积累起来了。
一起吐槽

我想每个程序员在写代码的时候可能都有这些历程(夸张)：
这坨代码谁写的，怎么要这样写啊，我这个需求该怎么加代码！
(尝试在shit山上小心地走，并添加新代码)写的好难受，shit越改越chou了...
算了，爷来重构一下，结束掉一切吧！
重构的一天：我曰，这个地方怎么埋了个雷，我来排一下；哇，怎么这里还有奇怪的逻辑，哼哧哼哧问了之前的同事说是PM改的需求；哎，爱咋地咋地。
Several days later -> git revert -> 下班
在原来的shit山上再拉一坨，OK，很稳定，提测…]]></summary>

又是一年年关将至。
每到这个时候，大家都会列个清单，做了什么，还有什么还没有做。
我也大概捋了一下，嚯，跟大部分的小伙伴一样，完成的计划给人感觉才过了大半年。
慢是慢了一点，顺着今年的时间线，聊聊今年的人和事吧～
一、工作
在大公司的好处之一就是，身边的技术大佬很多，大腿总是抱不完。
每次聊到某些技术，康可、医生和周林总能聊点什么，好像就没有他们不知道的技术。
因为我是和医生在一条线上，有的时候遇到点问题，医生会给出一些解决方案，有事没事总能学到一些新的技术。
比如 MotionLayout，还输出了一篇文章：
《真的有这么丝滑吗？MotionLayout的高级玩法我学会了！》
1. 技术指标
除了在业务上拧拧螺丝，技术指标也少不了。
没有 KPI 的人生不完美，其实技术指标也挺有意思的。
我特别喜欢张绍文在《启动优化（上）：从启动过程看启动速度优化》说的：
启动优化不能过于 KPI 化，要从用户的真实体验出发，要着眼从点击图标到用户可操作的整个过程。
换句话说，性能优化如果降低用户当前场景的时长感知，而加重了另外一个场景的时长感知，这对用户是不负责任的。
去年的第一个目标是编译优化，其实我挺想做组件化，但项目代码很大，我一个人搞不定（目前组内计划在做了）。
所以我退而求其次，搞了模块 AAR，如果组件化搞成，就会对编译时长降低有帮助。
第一版做的 AAR 有点拉胯，因为上传 Module 要输入命令，改版本还要修改配置文件，这无疑提高了同事们的开发成本。
下半年通过康可学习了自动化技术，将上传 AAR 的整个过程集成在自动化工具蓝盾上，一切就很轻松了！
在这个过程中，先后加深或者学习了 Gradle、自动化工具、Shell 命令等技术，输出了以下文章：
《即学即用Gradle - Groovy中的11个特性》
《从Github Action入门自…]]></summary>

        <id>http://www.zhihu.com/question/511005082/answer/2306766341</id>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天刚好和 @Denzel 聊了两句这个事情。


价格
其实没有大家吐槽的糟糕。$12.7b 是很贵没错，加上宣布之前的市值基础上的 64% premium 就更吓人。但如果想象成和 Zynga 的市值巅峰 $10+b 的基础，再给点溢价，那整个事情就会比较合理，要不然股东肯定也会跳。
其实 1/3 现金 + 2/3 T2 的股票，也已经分摊了不少风险。Zynga 股价在过去一年多一直崩都没停过，对于大部分股票都集中在机构投资者的公司来说，也算是给股东小解套，股东还是能接受的，但如果 T2 股票立刻抛的话其实没多大赚头，所以 2/3 换成 T2 股票也是希望股东持有。



为啥买
T2 嚷嚷了好几年的进入移动端一直不算成功，NBA 2K Mobile 才算是摸到了边。但作为一家上市公司，移动端的故事必须得给股东一个交代。
T2 之前也收购一些手游厂比如 Social Points，但现在看来承接 IP 和做中重度能力没有达到预期。旗下 2K 有手游工作室但产能捉急，R 星必然是专注在 HD 端的主机 + PC，他们的模式和手游开发完全不搭边甚至有反效果。所以在 T2 大架构下面需要做一个 mobile business，收购是比较快的方法。


买到了啥
我认为 T2 并不希望这么大一个 deal，而且 Zynga 也是一家用并购来做规模做市值的公司，一些被逼着打包买的资产特别多，write-off 陆续有来吧。但 T2 需要好几家工作室来撑起移动端业务，不能慢慢收。市面上估计也没其他好的标的，应该是各方权衡后的结果，资产大致包括：
1. Zynga Poker 是比较稳定流水的产品，这块没太大风险
2. 休闲品类的能力，可以结合 2K 一些 IP 来做轻度一点的品类，开发周期比较短，靠 IP 加买量也能来一波钱，风险也比较可控
3. 中重度，应该是看到了收购的工作室 Natural Motions 做的跨端 (移动端 + NS) 4v4 TPS 的 Star Wars: Hunters 品质还比较符合预期，至少能力上是证明了，可以逐步把一些 IP 迁移过去搞中重度收购
4. 内置的广告系统，手游相互导量，抵消买量的成本
5. 权益，包括星战和哈利波特 IP 游戏开发权


一些想法

马后炮来说，最好当然是过去几年 T2 逐渐收一些手游厂，像 EA 收购 Industrial Toys 或者是自建，比如 Activision Mobile……现在要迅速拉起一块上规模的手游业务，只能收购一些比较成熟的公司
T2 有点着急了，几款 2K 体育游戏比较稳，但没有可观增量，IP 授权也要给出去一大笔钱；GTA6 还有好几年，别的 IP 比如四海兄弟、江湖本色这些都老化明显，续作比较无力，无主之地的 Gearbox 被 Embracer 卖掉又多了一些未知之数 (虽然 HD 端发行权还是 2K)
如果能买个国内中型厂是个比较划算的选择，但世界并不是平的

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[滑板底盘，理性看待吧。借悠跑科技这个问题，我们仔细聊聊。
（可看视频，也可速读全文）
滑板底盘是什么？有没有被夸大？
首先，滑板底盘，并不是一个新词。
最初的概念，是由通用汽车在2002年提出的。
那个时候，通用汽车的脑洞和创造力都非常大。他们发布了Hy-wire概念车，天生自带2个标签，“氢动力+线控底盘“。
这在当时，相当有突破性。

首先，车身和底盘是分开的。再者，底盘确实是“滑板造型”，基本纯平，而且应用了原属于航空领域的线控技术，才将传统的液压转向、制动等结构抛弃了。
同时，这还是一款氢能源车。储氢罐布置在底盘中央，电池系统、热管理系统、电机系统，均以模块化的形式布置在储氢罐四周。
如果将储氢罐替换成动力电池，与如今的电动车“滑板底盘”如出一辙。

那么，底盘与车身之间又是如何连接的？
通用汽车给出了自己的方案。如果是电器类，则有专门的电器接口实现连接，而机械连接则借助于多个固定连接件。
最形象的理解，就是将饭盒的上盖，扣在盒身上，再“咔吧”一下，将卡扣夹紧。所以，理论上，一个底盘，可以适配多种形式的车身，而这些连接件设计，又可以满足快速拆卸的要求。
如果真的实现了，完全可以说，汽车不仅可以换电池，而且可以换车身了。

---------
滑板底盘的概念重新翻红，主要因为在太平洋彼岸，有一家美国新势力上市了，它的名字叫Rivian。
（问题中的悠跑科技，也有中国Rivian之称）
Rivian创造了一个行业纪录，上市首日高开约37%，盘中涨幅一度超过53%，市值超1000亿美元，一举超过了通用、福特、本田等传统车企。

它的核心技术，正是滑板式底盘。其他人或许只是将这种底盘当概念，但Rivian真的造出了量产车。
再回过头，我们定义一下滑板底盘。它是底盘模块化的技术新阶段，是汽车设计和汽车制造的集大成者。
滑板底盘由机械结构件、电子结构件组成，可划分为前桥、中桥、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 与 Mozilla 达成交易

Linux Mint 发行版与 Mozilla 达成了 一笔未披露金额的交易，目的是修改 Linux Mint 上的 Firefox 配置。从 Linux Mint 19 开始，Firefox 的默认起始页将不再指向 Linux Mint 提供的起始页；默认搜索引擎不再是 Linux Mint 的搜索合作伙伴，如 Yahoo 和 DuckDuckGo，而是 Mozilla 的搜索合作伙伴，如 Google 等；默认配置恢复到 Mozilla 默认；没有上游以外的补丁；其上的 Firefox 的更新也将都由 Mozilla 负责。


老王点评：嘴里都是主义，实际都是生意。




又一个 5 亿用户的安全软件也加入了加密货币挖矿程序

知名安全产品 Norton 360 上周被发现整合了加密货币挖矿程序，但没有默认激活。另一款拥有 5 亿用户的安全软件 Avira 也在做 同样的事情。与 Norton 类似，用户需要选择加入才能激活挖矿程序。Avira 和 Norton 360 都属于 NortonLifeLock 公司。这两个杀毒软件中的挖矿程序都是利用计算机的闲置算力挖掘以太坊。但是根据测算，Norton 中挖矿的收益基本上只能覆盖电费，Avira 中的估计也差不多。


老王点评：虽然挖矿活动需要用户主动打开才会运行，但是一个安全软件做这些事情，可能就如一个用户说的，“Norton 应该检测并关闭加密货币采矿劫持，而不是安装他们自己的”。




LibreOffice 7.3 将引入对《星际迷航》克林贡语的支持

但 文档基金会很高兴地报告，“克林贡人如今还没有接管 LibreOffice 错误跟踪器的控制权” —— 你恐怕还是得用你的日常语言提交错误报告。文档基金会解释称，此举不会让开发团队的注意力从基础功能上大幅偏离。即使有人想帮助翻译克林贡语，也不意味着项目中的其他人会停下其它重要任务。LibreOffice 已提供对百余种语言的支持，7.3 版本更新将于 2 月初到来。


老王点评：好吧，开源总是可以任性一些，只要你喜欢，你可以做一些小众的事情。]]></summary>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

导读 - 魔术进入选修课堂，这或许不只是理想
Hello，少数派的朋友们大家新年好，我是老麦的颜粉，热心网友阿 Park；一直想写一篇《关于我开了一门魔术选修课这档子事儿》，不知道算不算得上生活主题的 2021 年度征文，但这不就来了么？
自 2018 年毕业工作以来，一直致力于素质教育方向的工作，可以说是「双减」政策的最坚定的拥护者之一；迄今为止，学习加表演魔术十余年，更有幸在海口、北京、普利茅斯、伦敦等大大小小的场合，演过一些不成熟的东西。在回海南建设自由贸易港之前，曾在中国科教之城——安徽合肥学习工作过一段时间，作为某私立学校校研发中心的一员（重要），画了不少的关于素质教育的大饼，今天抽一张出来分给大家。
一个秃头男子对毕业合照不想发表评论
饼不多，一人一口；如今暂时告别魔术教育所以更无广告，安心食用。只希望有生之年能靠稿费买只监工水獭，那我们开始。

前言 - 这事儿是怎么开始的？
2019 年底应该是疫情的第一轮爆发，那时做英文教育培训的公司濒临倒闭，本人为数不多的朋友之一，合肥名媛 Chenzi 想要开店；她需要一个负责骑电动车，迫切想要逃离英文一段时间的人。2020 年四月带着两台电脑、几件厚衣服，风风火火地去了合肥，圆了一个当安徽人的梦。
挡一下脸，我怕老麦变成我的颜粉
无所事事的两个月，陪着 Chenzi 走过了创业初期的沟沟坎坎，但依旧不知道自己未来的工作方向，毕竟职业生涯不是 Matrix，没有那么多能让少数派发声的地方。直到有一天晚上…]]></summary>

2021 年对于 Kubernetes 来说是令人兴奋的一年，这些文章证明了这一点。从有趣的界面到家庭实验室再到开发环境，看看我在 2021 年最喜欢的 K8s 文章。

如果你对基本原理感兴趣，这篇 介绍 Linux 上的容器 的文章从内到外阐明了 Linux 容器的工作原理。你是否想获取一些乐趣？安装 minikube 并开始使用 DOOM 游戏作为界面 来管理它。另一个选择是 kubectl，这是一个更传统的 Kubernetes 控制 CLI。

即使你只在你的 Linux 家庭实验室 上运行 Kubernetes，你也可以使用 Terraform 和 Helm 等工具来自动化日常操作。这创造了一个 更好地掌握 Terraform 的机会。

生活中可以确定的几件事之一是，计算机会以奇怪而有趣的方式出错。用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 监控你的 Kubernetes 集群，看看它是如何出错的。使用 Grafana Tempo 的分布式跟踪来监控里面运行的应用。通过引入 Chaos Mesh 在 Kubernetes 中造成有意的混乱，来监控你监控的性能。

如果你正在开发在 Kubernetes 上运行的应用，Quarkus 可以帮助你开发和测试。使用 Java 的开发者 可以在 Kubernetes 上使用容器运行 应用。像 Tackle-DiVA 这样的工具有助于将应用移植到容器中。

像所有成功的开源项目一样，Kubernetes 的部分价值是一个强大的 生态系统。比如 KubeEdge 项目，它有助于将计算和数据更接近终端用户。在使用 Kubernetes 一段时间后，你甚至可能想 成为 Kubernetes 维护者。

有这么多有趣的 Kubernetes 内容可供学习，可能很难将它们全部看完。不过，对于系统管理员和开发人员来说，优秀的 Kubernetes 资源是必须的。请阅读这些精选的内容。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我知道对于圣诞愿望清单来说已经太晚了，但我仍然想分享我希望在 GNOME 中看到的东西。




GNOME 是许多 Linux 发行版的默认桌面环境。它也是我最喜欢的一个，因为它提供了一种现代的桌面体验。

但这并不意味着 GNOME 是完美的，不需要改进。事实上，这里有几个建议可以改善整个用户体验。

1、方便的应用程序卸载选项

桌面 Linux 是碎片化的。为了增加混乱，连软件包也是零零散散的。而最糟糕的是当你从系统中删除一个应用程序时。

举个例子，你要通过 DEB 包安装一个应用程序，并使用 GNOME 软件中心界面来安装它。

但如果你不喜欢这个应用程序，想把它删除呢？

你不会在软件中心中找到该应用程序。相反，你得必须使用命令行的方法。

这还没完。还有 Snap 和 Flatpak 软件包。如果你已经使用了其中之一，你必须先找出来，然后使用正确的命令才行。

GNOME 采用了类似于 Android/iOS 的方法，将应用程序显示在一个网格中，并将它们组织在文件夹中。移动操作系统为用户提供了一种方式，即按住图标并删除应用程序。如果能有一个类似的选项，右键点击应用程序图标并选择卸载，那就更好了。



这样，终端用户就不用管所安装的应用程序是 Deb 包还是 Snap 包。没有必要为此进入终端，而且它就发生在访问应用程序地方，这不是挺好吗？

Linux Mint Cinnamon 版有这样的功能，你在菜单中右键点击一个应用程序条目，选择删除它。



如果 Cinnamon 能做到，GNOME 应该也能做到，对吗？

2、在应用程序商店中设置默认软件源

如果一个应用程序有多种格式，GNOME 软件中心可以让你选择软件源。至少这是我在 Fedora 的 GNOME 软件中看到的，但在 Ubuntu 中没有。

Odd Future 领军人物的年度新专。相比上一张专辑略显暗黑的风格，这一张专辑略显严肃。专辑中《MANIFESTO》对于所谓 Cancel Culture 进行了愤怒地反驳。正如他在《MASSA》中唱的那样：“我已经在镜头前平静下来...... 我不是你们 19 岁时被介绍给的那个小男孩”。 整张专辑的音乐风格较以往来说更加柔和。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谢邀！
很荣幸能来和大家分享《紫川》的创作历程，我叫陈闻，我和李振锋李导，共同任职《紫川》项目的导演。首先跟大家同步一个消息，原本预定18号上线的互动剧第2章《血修罗》，在本周播出的第五集中，看“一”送“二”，提前和观众见面了，大家别忘记看哈！
《紫川》上线以来，我和李导关注了平台上的各种反馈，对于观众的意见和建议，我们都一一记在了小本本上，很感谢大家的反馈，那些都是我们未来努力的方向。 其中有一个意外，那就是《紫川》讨论词条中的最多的竟然是“互动隐藏剧”，怎么说呢，这个意外真的很让人意外……其实，和大家评论的一样，《紫川》的互动形式，属于轻互动，就是在正集一些特殊的剧情点，增设了不影响主线的“隐藏剧集”按钮，观众老爷无论是选择“穿越”观看，还是看完正集，再返回来观看，都是可以的。（宝，你什么都是对的.jpg）
“番剧互动”这样的概念，我们其实是在项目策划初期就已经提出。我们主要是想给观众更多的选择，但是经过测试，发现剧集暂停→观众选择→剧集播出→剧集暂停→观众选择，这样的形式，不仅影响剧情节奏，还非常废手，尤其是废的还是观众老爷的手，这就得慎重考量了。（正义由我来守护.jpg）
之后，我们发现《紫川》第一部《紫川三杰》更偏群像戏，比如说，虽然紫川秀是男主角，但其他两位“斯特林”和“帝林”的戏份也非常重要，可是他们常常各自为战，主角紫川秀没有在他身边，导致剧情不是由主角推动的，这会让故事有割裂感。[让人头秃.jpg]
综合考量后，团队决定将一些主角没有参与，但是非常重要的戏份，以及一些不同时间线的比较精彩的戏份，规划到了隐藏剧环节，比如隐藏互动剧《血修罗》中，冷酷铁血的帝林军团为了胜利，就地掠夺以战养战；为了永绝后患，将身高超过车轮的魔族全部杀掉，播种“恐惧”；为了保证军团作战利益最大化，将奴隶军团送上前线……这段故事中，有充满魅力的人设，外加大规模群集特效、丰富的兵种、血肉对拼的攻城战氛围，虽然游离在主角主线之外，非常经典可看！于是我们将这段戏份单独做成了隐藏互动剧集，和正集一起呈现给观众。
可以这么理解，《紫川》中，正剧是还原原著剧情主线，互动隐藏剧主要是为了细化扩展重点人物故事！ [就这么愉快的决定了.jpg]
 好吧，编不下去了，我摊牌了！《紫川》看“一”送“二”的行为，纯粹就是为了能让观众老爷多看点！[不管你信不信，反正我信了.jpg]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[让 macOS 直接运行 iOS 程序已经不是什么新鲜的事情了。自从 M1 系列的 Mac 问世以来，我们在 Mac App Store 甚至可以直接下载安装受支持的 iOS 应用，并用键盘鼠标来模拟触摸操作在 macOS 上使用这些 iOS 应用。虽然已经有很多 iOS 应用直接支持了在 macOS 上的安装，还是有一些应用开发者为了减少开发成本或者担心其他因素，选择将自己的 iOS 应用从 Mac App Store 上移除。
如果我们依旧希望在系统架构完全支持的 M1 系列 Mac 上面使用这些应用，那么就需要特殊的手段 —— 旁加载，也就是 sideloading —— 才能安装这些 iOS 应用。这是 macOS 11.2.3 之前的常规操作，我们称这段时期为「前 macOS 旁加载」时代。
显然，Apple 并不想让我们轻松地就将未经验证、不受支持的 iOS 应用直接在 macOS 上成功运行。曾被允许的简单「旁加载」在 macOS 11.3 的更新中被 Apple 禁用，自然最新的 macOS Monterey 12.1 也不受支持。因此，在「后 macOS 旁加载」时代，我们需要 PlayCover —— 一个专门用于在 M1 Mac 上安装 iOS 应用的辅助程序的帮助，才能够完整地在 M1 Mac 上面安装并体验未受支持的 iOS 应用。

后 macOS 旁加载时代 PlayCover 的优势
如前面提到，虽然依旧是「旁加载」的原理，但是 PlayCover 本身已经是一套完整的在 macOS 上运行 iOS 程序的辅助软件，相比于「前 macOS 旁加载」时代，PlayCover：

本篇文章翻译自 👉Hero animations，向开发者介绍了 Hero 动画的用处和分类，不同类型的 Hero 动画的创建。
其实在我们的开发过程中，我们可能已经看见过 Hero 动画了，比如像电商类 App 的一个典型场景，商品列表页到商品详情页，列表页的缩略图需要带到详情页，并且带的过程中可能有大小，位置等的变化。在 Flutter 中，这种页面简直共有元素的动画就叫做 Hero 动画 ，有的时候也叫做 共享元素动画。
Flutter 官方的每周组件也介绍了 Hero 组件：👉 Hero 组件介绍
本文就演示如何构建标准的 Hero 动画，以及在页面过渡过程中将图像从圆形转换为方形的 Hero 动画。
可以使用 Hero 组件来创建这种动画。随着Hero动画从源路由到目标路由，目标路由也会在这一过程中淡入到视图上。一般来说，Hero 组件是两个页面 UI 的一部分，比如图片等等。从用户体验的角度来说，Hero 组件是从源路由飞到了目标路由。我们就用代码实现下面的 Hero 效果。
Standard hero animations
标准的 Hero 动画是 Hero 元素从一个页面飞到另一个页面，并且一般情况下位置和尺寸会有变化。比如是这样的：

第一个页面图片是在中间的，到了第二个蓝色页面，图片的位置和大小都发生了变化。从第二个页面到第一个页面，图片又还原到最初的样子。
Radial hero animations
在 radial hero 动画中， 随着页面的过渡，Hero的形状会发生变化从圆形到矩形。比如下面的效果：

上面的效果就是一个radial hero 动画，底部的三个元素，依次展示到第二个页面的中间，并且形状从圆形到矩形。从第二个页面回到第一个页面，图片元素还原到最初的样子。
Hero 动画的基本结构

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

一种幸运
有些时候我会这么想：人生中开到的第一台车是 Mini Cooper，这本身需要足够的幸运。
在开车回家的路上，想起来了向老爸借钥匙泡夏树的拓海，在这些年逐渐的成长过程中理解了重野秀一笔下的青春。终有一天，我们也会变成这既最好也最坏的时代中的，那个深夜里望着车发呆的人。
始终要轮到自己开车，轮到自己去看看广阔的世界，也要载着朋友、家人一起出发。
MINI 在 BMW 化之后的今天似乎又有了诸多的改变（从小写变成了大写），而在经过了一段时间的熟悉之后，（我与）这辆车终于准备好了。
这样一台 2011 年的经典三门 Mini Cooper Excitement（代号 R56），搭载 120 马力横置直列四缸 1.6L 自然吸气 N12B16BA 引擎与爱信 6 速手自一体变速箱，原配倍耐力 195/45 R16的星标防爆轮胎，至今已经行驶了十一万公里。

本文仅以 2021 年少数派线下聚会与老麦的约定为契机，谨献所有对 Mini Cooper 依然抱有兴趣的人们。
2021 年双 11 傍晚，与老麦再度相见，终有机会一起合影
关于 Mini Cooper 的 Q&A
Q：你喜欢这辆车吗？
A：爱恨交加。要说爱有多深，恨就有多切。事实上，我并不喜欢开车这件事，甚至也因为停车困难和保养的麻烦一度抵触开车。但在马路上驰骋的和弯道上的快乐是不会忘记的，Mini 也当然是一辆能够令我笑出声的好车。
Q：Mini 适合女性吗？
A：Mini 适合所有人，但并不是每一代都是如此。女性标签是 Mini 的重要特色之一，但却不是最重要的。我在…]]></summary>

测试
接下来用以下两个我们常用的拓展函数作为例子

    contract {
        callsInPlace(block, InvocationKind.EXACTLY_ONCE)
    }

run和isNullOrEmpty我相信大家在开发中是经常见到的。
不知道那些代码有什么作用，那么我们就把那几行代码去掉，然后看看函数使用起来有什么区别。
public inline fun  T.runWithoutContract(block: T.() -> R): R {

}

public inline fun CharSequence?.isNullOrEmptyWithoutContract(): Boolean {

这次机主算是“熟人”了，因为在19年的时候就找我定制组装过一台银欣的【小乌鸦】，时隔两年多，这次准备又弄台新机子。

机主的需求：整机预算10K范围，主要用于玩游戏，游戏分辨率锁定2K144（会决定显卡），可接受又灯光，但要求纯色简约。箱体一开始锁定ATX\MATX塔式箱体，后面又考虑希望有一定的方便性，所以改为ITX方案，所以除了箱体其余配置最终定为下面这样。

AMD方案：替换zen3+B550I即可，不过选AMD ZEN3平台会有问题，一个是B550I经常缺货（微星就经常没），另外就是价格也贵一点（对比11代主板要贵几百），而且没核显。所以当时这台机子就锁定了11代。
12代：这价位如果换i5 12600KF+Z690I也OK，价格大概贵几百（主要还是主板），性能略微高一点（对比11700），优势是未来升级空间，缺点是无核显跟贵一点。机主当时觉得没必要，所以就还是11代。大家抄作业可以按自己需求考虑。

 
02/ 关于乔思伯V11
这次的方案箱体选了乔思伯V11，对于ITX装机作业来说，箱体重要性类似汽车的底盘，会决定你其它配置如何搭配选择，所以按需选择是非常重要的。
前面说过机主的需求，最高性能需求就是游戏，所…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[与时间管理的七年之痒
是的你没看错，我的时间管理之路还要从7年前说起。
2012年考上大学我才拥有了自己的智能手机，并且刚从小城市到北京，慢慢适应了校园生活。那个时候的互联网对于我来说就是真正的信息海洋，我每天都在贪婪地吸收各种各样的知识。到2014年我通过李笑来接触到了时间管理这个概念，并且看了《把时间当作朋友》，才知道原来厉害人是这样玩儿的。于是在2015年我开始亲身实践，认真记录了一整年的时间分配。
第一阶段：机械操作时间管理
这一年我使用的是最原始的柳比歇夫时间记录法，使用手机软件记录每件事开始和结束的时间，晚上使用十分钟左右把每天的时间使用情况记录到本子上，每周和每月都会进行统计分析。记录了整整一年，我对自己的时间分配就有了一个大致的掌握，通过这种原始的毫无修饰的记录，我才发现原来维持生命活动就需要很多时间，比如吃饭、上厕所、洗澡，基本上每天会用2-4个小时。更别提偶然的发呆和刷微博，一转眼就是两个小时。就像《深度工作》里说的，每天能高效工作4小时就算很厉害了。
必须包含：吃饭、睡觉、洗衣服、洗澡、做家务
这种方法我个人无法长期使用，因为很耗费精力。用了一整年我也没变成习惯，还是会在有些时候忘记记录自己做一件事的开始时间。但它确实如上文所说让我对“真实的时间”有了概念，而不是感觉上的时间。
毕业之后开始被工作事项追走着，我发现我无法主动“使用”我的时间，而是得“安排”时间，也就是从时间管理转到了任务管理。 任务管理当然得采用大名鼎鼎的GTD（Get Things Done），但对于我来说，我只能做到GET THINGS，最后一步DONE始终做不到。
我尝试了基本上所有主流的待办事项app（应该很多人都经历过这个阶段吧？只要看到别人推荐新软件就心痒的下下来试用一下）。但这段时间我并没有觉得自己变得更高效，反倒是对于越垒越长的待办清单束手无策，并且十分讨厌自己的拖延行…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[防杠指南：

本文主的着重点在于付费订阅服务这个趋势本身的讨论，汇率的切换的绝对值大家不用太过于在意，觉得高了可以认为我把税也算进去了
本次讨论的订阅服务，主要是互联网的、比较统一的服务，那种可自定义的、分很多层级的没有纳入主要的讨论范围

付费订阅服务这个话题很有意思，前段时间就有两件事引起了大家的热议。一个是爱奇艺在2021年12月15日进行了全方面的提价，他们认为“视频平台的会员订阅价格一直偏低，这一现象已影响到了行业的健康发展”了；另一个则是网红笔记软件Notability从“买断制”转成订阅制。
其实网友们付费的意愿并不低，不过让大家觉得懊恼的是，厂商并没有给付费用户提供更好的、符合预期的产品。虽然有些引用突然改成订阅很难受，但开发者要生存大家也能理解，质量好的也愿意付费，而被大家屡次吐槽的，莫过于视频平台的会员专属广告了。
话说没有对比就没有伤害，我们都知道现在付费流媒体霸主是美国的Netflix。珠玉在前，我们当然知道那种体验好，但其中的代价呢？
 
中美付费订阅的价格有和不同？ 
国内外互联网付费订阅对比
根据我在美国6年多的生活经验以及一点搜索，我一共整理了167个中美日常使用频率较高的、面向个人消费者的、提供付费订阅服务的平台/软件，上面这张图便是这些类型聚合起来的中位数价格。
而据美国一家咨询公司West Monroe的报告，在2500个样本中发现，人均每月订阅的付费服务价格为$273，比疫情前2018年的$237提高了15%，相当于每年多花了$430，折合人民币近3000块钱。
由于我这次探讨的订阅付费主要是比较“互联网”的、且少可自定义层级的，所以，我们要剔除273美金中上网、手机话费的构成。根据我的经验，这可是大头，于是在找到了原有的报告数据之后，果然，这俩加起来一共是$150，所以，这个报告的“人均每月互联网付费订阅服务”应该是$123。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源开发者自毁其广泛使用的依赖库

开源库 colors.js 和 faker.js 被广泛使用。在 NPM 上，colors.js 的周下载量超过 2000 万次，有近 19000 个项目依赖它。前几天，它的开发者在这些库的最新版本中加入了无限循环和乱码，依赖它的项目会在控制台看到不停打印的非 ASCII 字符。他将这两个库的 自毁版本 推送到了 GitHub 和 NPM，因而导致多个使用这些依赖库的软件出现故障，其中包括亚马逊的 AWS CDK。这位开发者似乎是因为没有得到使用他的开源软件的大公司的 付费，而专门做了这种破坏。这件事引来了业界和社区的激烈讨论。


老王点评：我认为，你可以因没有得到报酬而放弃项目，但是这不是你蓄意报复的理由。如果一开始就想着获益，请发布你的商业版本。这种最初遵循开源许可证和开源文化的开源软件，在邀名不成、获利不得后恼羞成怒地大肆破坏，或许没有违反许可证和法律，但是却给整个开源文化泼了一盆脏水。我对这种行为持反对意见。




Mozilla 基金会其实从 2014 年就开始接受加密货币捐款

之前我们报道过，Mozilla 基金会官方 Twitter 账号在 1 月 1 日提醒粉丝它接受加密货币，如比特币、以太坊的捐款，但这一声明招致了 猛烈批评，最终迫使 Mozilla 基金会宣布 暂停 接受加密货币捐款。但实际上 Mozilla 基金会从 2014 年就开始 接受加密货币捐款，当时 Mozilla 还列举了其它接受加密货币捐款的组织，如可汗学院、电子前沿基金会、绿色和平组织和维基媒体基金会。到今天，只有绿色和平组织停止接受加密货币捐款。


老王点评：加密货币是否该死，我觉得不能用政治正确来评判。




Windows 11 上仍能使用软驱和软盘

去年发布的 Windows 11 系统，调整了硬件安装需求，很多硬件都不再支持，需要使用较新的 CPU 和 TPM 2.0 等等。但是，有用户发现，Windows 11 上居然还可以成功使用索尼 5.25 寸软盘。这意味着，Windows 11 对外部设备还保留了不错的兼容性。


老王点评：虽然 5.25 寸、3.5 寸软盘已经基本退出历史舞台，可在特定领域依然有用武之地，但这个反差让我有些吃惊。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有 几个可用于 Linux 的截图工具，我喜欢 使用 Flameshot 进行截图 和 Shutter 来编辑现有的截图。

但不幸的是，Flameshot 不能在 4K 屏幕上工作。因此，我不得不使用默认的 GNOME 截图工具，它在我的带有超高清屏幕的戴尔 XPS 上工作得非常好。



这一“被迫之举”让我意识到，如果你知道如何正确使用，GNOME 截图 并不是一个糟糕的工具。

在这里，我指的是用键盘快捷键来使用它，因为这样可以节省大量的时间。

让我展示一下如何像专家一样用那些方便的键盘快捷键来使用 GNOME 截图应用。

我假定你没有改变这里的默认的截图的键盘快捷键。

对整个屏幕进行截图：使用 Prt Scr 键

这是最简单的操作。在你的键盘上找到 Prt Sc（或称 Prt Scr、Prt Scn）键并按下它。它将对整个屏幕进行截图，并将其保存在你的主目录下的图片文件夹中。



在某些发行版（或版本）中，你可能会看到是否要保存截图的选项，但大多数情况下，它会自动保存屏幕截图。

这里需要注意的另一件事是，如果你有多个屏幕连接到系统上，它会把所有的屏幕一起截图。这意味着，你会得到一个超宽的图像。

但是，如果你只想对某个应用进行截图，而不是对整个屏幕进行截图呢？

给一个应用程序的窗口截图：使用 Alt+Prt Scr 键

要给正在运行的图形应用截图，你需要这样做：

点击正在运行的应用，使其获得焦点。现在，按住 Alt 键并按 Prt Scr 键。

它将得到应用窗口的截图，并保存到图片目录中。



这样获取的截图也有一个阴影效果，看起来很不错。

这很好，但如果你只想给某个特定区域截图，而不是整个屏幕呢？这也有一个技巧。

对屏幕的选定区域进行截图：使用 Shift+Prt Scr 键

按住 Shift 键。然后按 Prt Scr 键。你会看到屏幕上出现一个选框。将鼠标移动到所需的区域，开始拖动光标。它将高亮显示该区域，并在你释放鼠标后立即进行截图。



复制截图到剪贴板而不是保存它们

当你在和别人聊天时，要和对方分享屏幕截图时，这非常有用。



首先截图，但没必要将保存的截图文件附在聊天工具中。相反，你可以直接将截图复制到剪贴板，然后使用 Ctrl+V 快捷键将图像（从剪贴板）粘贴到聊天工具。

这样，你的系统就不会保留不必要的截图，你也可以节省一些鼠标点击次数。

要把截图保存到剪贴板，以便你能把它们粘贴到聊天工具、绘图工具或文档中，你必须把 Ctrl 键和你在前面几节中看到的其他截图快捷键一起使用。


Ctrl+Prt Scr：将整个屏幕的截图复制到剪贴板上。

Ctrl+Alt+Prt Scr：将应用窗口的截图复制到剪贴板上。

Ctrl+Shift+Prt Scr：将选定区域的截图复制到剪贴板上


我必须补充一点，在这种情况下，使用像 Flameshot 这样的工具 甚至更好一些，因为它允许你在将截图保存到剪贴板之前对其进行注释。这样，你可以很容易地高亮屏幕的重要部分。

在截图中添加延迟，以便对下拉菜单进行截图

到目前为止，一切都很好。你只需按下几个键，就可以随心所欲地进行截图了。

问题是，当你要对下拉菜单或右键动作等进行截图时。当你按下屏幕截图键时，想要的项目可能会消失。

为了处理这种情况，你可以对该区域或整个屏幕进行截图，但要有一个延迟。



在 GNOME 屏幕截图工具中，你可以选择添加这个延迟。例如，你添加了 6 秒的延迟。你点击截图按钮，有 6 秒时间来做/显示你想做的事情。6 秒后，它就会自动截图了。

你有什么技巧吗？

这就是我使用 GNOME 截图工具的所有技巧。如果你还没有广泛地使用它，你应该会发现它很有帮助。如果你已经是一个专家，也许你知道一些可以添加到本文中的东西？请在评论区与我们其他人分享吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021年一整年都是在日本度过的，因此购物的需求差异性很大，不再专一于某一品类的尝鲜，而是看到什么有意思的东西都要跟风一下。跟国内方便快捷的淘宝购物不同，日本的购物大多依赖于线下购物或者官网邮送。回想起这一年来，我买了不少新奇的玩意儿，冤枉钱花了着实不少，但是称心如意的东西却不多。总结这一年来购买的东西，筛筛选选，是对大家的好物安利，也同时算是对自己生活的一种记录。

以下分享的东西可能五花八门，但都是我经过一段时间使用过后觉得好用的东西，安利的同时会简单说说推荐理由，仅供大家参考。

New Balance 990 V3
参考入手价：1758元

与国内的球鞋潮流截然相反的是，日本街头很少能看到Yeezy和Air Jordan之类球鞋，大家穿着更多的是普通休闲鞋和正装鞋。New Balance这个品牌似乎能完美融入日系穿搭，街上随处可见。
坦白地讲，990 V3是我跟风入手的众多鞋款之一。但自从入手之后，穿着频率最多的就是它。一方面来说，这鞋非常百搭，可以和几乎任何裤子在一起进行搭配而不显得突兀。另一方面来说，990 V3没有Yeezy的那种软糯，能够给足底足够的支撑，包裹感也非常强，很适合长时间的步行。
当然，这双鞋也同样具有缺点。比如9系列价格偏高（国内会便宜很多），采用的碳纤维的中底不能沾水，否则很容易烂底。
Hoka OneOne KAHA GTX
参考入手价：2095元

这鞋其实是为了年末的北海道之行准备的。在做攻略的时候，发现自己并没有一双能防水且能防滑的鞋，故而买了这双Gore-Tex+Vibram鞋底加持的户外徒步鞋。
经过北海道“狂风暴雨”似的实战，我对这双鞋的喜爱仅次于上述的990 V3。
在结冰的道路上，5 毫米凹槽的 Vibram鞋底可以给到足够的抓地力（同行的小伙伴已经滑倒N次了）；在积雪很厚的情况下，Gore-Tex面料可以让你踏进雪地而没有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「告别效率，回归工具」
第一次听到这个观点还是在「我派」的微信群里。作为一个爱折腾的人，看到这句调侃的话仿佛被击中了一样，着实有点上头。
一年前我还是一个懵懂的「中年孩子」，那时的我认为 Office 就是效率工具的天花板。偏执的我坚持订阅正版的 Office，甚至对用 WPS 的同事嗤之以鼻。
作为效率工具祖师爷的 Office 骨子里还是带着一些高傲，尽管占内存、服务器经常抽风，但是在财会、政企等一些领域，还是无法离开 Excel 和 PPT。
开启探索之路
去年年初，一个比我还偏执的女人顶着「领导」的头衔走进的我工作里，把我拽进了效率工具圈子，正式开启了效率工具的探索之路。
听一个年轻的UI设计师分享自己的工作心得和学习经验时，有一句话让我觉得很羞愧：一个没有知识留存的人是很可悲的。
回看自己10年的工作经验，自己的知识经验散落四处：有的在硬盘里，有的在U盘里，有的在某度云盘，还有一些在iCloud。我从来没有认真地将自己的一些经验进行梳理和留存。
也是这个原因刺激我寻找一款让我真正高效和留存的软件，打造我个人的知识库。
Roam Research
在听同事分享心得的时候，我正在用领导疯狂安利的Roam Research记录。
用惯Word 和有道笔记的国内小白，突然用上Roam Research着实有点懵，全英文的界面、中世纪的设计风格、以「block」为基础的操作让我各种不适应。
Roam Research首页
尽管当时不懂什么是block、什么是双向链，抱着试一试的态度，想看看这个Roam Research 是怎么让一个高知女性变成脑残粉的。不知道说得对不对 ，Roam Research让我感觉最舒服的地方在于记录笔记时犹如在做思维导图，也有人称之为卡片式的笔记。
在Roam Research里摒弃了传统的文件夹概念，提倡用户随时记录，并可以通过双向链实现知识关…]]></summary>

但是，与其谈论这些问题，我更感兴趣的是弄清楚 —— 为什么 DNS 是分布式的是一件好事？

为什么 DNS 是分布式的是件好事？

一个原因是 可扩展性 —— DNS 的分布式设计使其更容易扩展，对故障的恢复能力更强。我发现，尽管 DNS 已经有近 40 年的历史，但它的扩展性仍然很好，这真是令人惊讶。这一点非常重要，但这并不是这篇文章的主题。

相反，我想说的是，它是分布式的意味着你可以 控制 你的 DNS 的工作方式。你可以向巨大而复杂的 DNS 服务器中添加更多的服务器！添加你控制的服务器！

昨天我 在 Twitter 上问 为什么你要运行自己的 DNS 服务器，我得到了很多很好的答案，我想在这里总结一下。

你可以运行 2 种类型的 DNS 服务器

你可以运行 2 种主要类型的 DNS 服务器：


如果你拥有一个域名，你可以为该域名运行一个 权威名称服务器

如果你有一台电脑（或一个有很多电脑的公司），你可以运行一个 解析器 来为这些电脑解析 DNS。


DNS 不是静态数据库

我经常看到 DNS 的 “电话簿” 比喻，域名就像人名，IP 地址就像电话号码。

这是一个不错的思维模型。但是，“电话簿” 思维模型可能会使你认为，如果你对 google.com 进行 DNS 查询，你将永远得到相同的结果。而这是不正确的。

你在 DNS 查询中得到的记录可能取决于：

APM 提供帧率的相关数据，即 FPS(Frames Per Second) 数据。FPS 在一定程度上反映了页面流畅程度，但 APM 提供的 FPS 并不是很准确。恰逢手淘低端机性能优化项目开启，亟需相关指标来衡量对滑动体验的优化，帧率数据探索实践就此拉开。
在探索实践中，我们遇到了许多问题：
高刷手机占比相对不低，影响整体 FPS 数据
非人为滑动数据参杂在 FPS 中，不能直接体现用户操作体验
计算平均数据时，卡顿数据被淹没在海量正常数据中，一次卡顿是否只影响一个 FPS 值还是一次用户操作体验？
经过一段时间的探索，我们沉淀下来了一些指标，其中包括：滑动帧率、冻帧占比、scrollHitchRate、卡顿帧率。除了相关帧率指标之外，为了更好的指导性能优化，APM 还提供了帧率主因分析，同时为了更好的定位卡顿问题，也提供了卡顿堆栈。

下面是 APM 基于平台的特性，对帧率相关探索实践的详细介绍，希望本文可以给大家带来一些帮助。
系统渲染机制
在介绍指标的实现之前，首先需要了解系统是如何做渲染的，只有知晓系统渲染机制，才能帮助我们更好的进行帧率数据计算处理。
渲染机制是 Android 中重要的一部分，其中又牵扯甚广，包括我们常说的 measure/layout/draw 原理、卡顿、过度绘制等，都与其相关。在这里我们主要是对渲染流程进行整体了解，知晓后续需要计算哪几部分、通过系统 API 得到了哪几部分，以便计算出目标数据。
渲染流程

我们都知道，当触发渲染后，会走到 ViewRootImpl 的 scheduleTraversals。这时，scheduleTraversals 方法主要是向 Choreographer 注册下一个 VSync 的回调。当下一个 VSync 来临时，Choreographer 首先切到主线程（传 VSync 上来…]]></summary>

本篇以android-11.0.0_r25作为基础解析
上一篇文章AOSP学习笔记 - init进程，我们分析了Android第一个用户进程init进程的启动过程和之后的守护服务
init进程启动了很多服务，例如Zygote，ServiceManager，MediaServer，SurfaceFlinger等，我们平常写Android应用都是使用Java语言，这次我们就先从Java世界的半边天：Zygote进程 开始分析
介绍
Zygote意为受精卵，它有两大作用，一是启动SystemServer，二是孵化启动App
启动服务
我们已经知道了init进程会从init.rc文件中解析并启动服务，那zygote是在哪定义的呢，init.rc的头几行就有一个import：import /system/etc/init/hw/init.${ro.zygote}.rc
我们在init.rc同目录下就能找到几个对应的文件：init.zygote32_64.rc init.zygote32.rc init.zygote64_32.rc init.zygote64.rc，具体import哪个文件与具体设备硬件有关，现在64位手机这么普及了，我们就以init.zygote64.rc为目标分析

Handler 存在的意义？
线程通信，消息管理？这只是 Handler 的附带功能。Handler 是 Android 的基础，维持了 App 运行，所有的代码都运行在 Handler 之上
设计思路
就像一个传送带， Hander 负责添加消息，Looper 就像传送带在不停的转动并依次取出 MessageQueue 中的消息

源码
Looper：一个线程对应一个 Loopper，用于从 MessageQueue 中取出消息，创建 Looper 对象的同时会创建 MessageQueue 对象。Looper 创建后调用 loop() 方法开启消息循环
//构造函数是 private 类型，外部类只能通过 prepare() 方法创建 Looper 对象
private static void prepare(boolean quitAllowed) {
    //判断当前线程是否创建了 Looper 对象
    if (sThreadLocal.get() != null) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Only one Looper may be created per thread");
    }
    //保存 Looper 对象
    sThreadLocal.set(new Looper(quitAllowed));
}

//创建 Looper 对象

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[theme: github
背景是这样的，
我们对外提供了一个 sdk，收到客户的反馈，说他们监控平台监测到 sdk 内部的一个接口 A 经常有耗时，最多能达到 10 几秒。
可从我们自己的平台看，接口 A 的耗时是正常范围的，而且使用的网络库 timeout = 8s，不太可能出现耗时 10 几秒的问题。
由于客户也没有稳定的复现场景，也不排除是对方统计工具的问题，就卡住了。
进展，
重新回到代码中，经过又一番的代码走查，注意到了该接口有使用 AsyncTask ，点进 AsyncTask 源码一看，突然有种玄学变科学的感觉：
    private static final int CORE_POOL_SIZE = 1;
    private static final int MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE = 20;
    private static final int KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS = 3;
    public static final Executor THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR;
    ...

    static {
        ThreadPoolExecutor threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                CORE_POOL_SIZE, MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE, KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                new SynchronousQueue(), sThreadFactory);
        threadPoolExecutor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(sRunOnSerialPolicy);
        THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR = threadPoolExecutor;
    }

了解线程池的应该都知道，
CORE_POOL_SIZE : 核心线程数。核心线程只有在 allowCoreThreadTimeOut = true 时，才会被回收，否则不会被回收掉的，即使没有任务执行，也会保持空闲状态。
MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE : 线程池最大允许创建的线程数。当线程数量达到 corePoolSize， 且 workQueue 队列塞满后，才会继续创建线程；当创建的线程达到 MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE 时，新来的任务会执行拒绝策略。
KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS : 表示非核心线程在没有任务执行时，最多能保持多少时间会被回收。
SynchronousQueue
直接在网上找了一段容易理解的定义：
“ SynchronousQueue 是一个不存储元素的阻塞队列，消费者线程调用 take() 方法的时候就会发生阻塞，直到有一个生产者线程生产了一个元素，消费者线程就可以拿到这个元素并返回；生产者线程调用put()方法的时候就会发生阻塞，直到有一个消费者线程消费了一个元素，生产者才会返回。”
结论
由于 CORE_POOL_SIZE = 1, 且阻塞队列为 SynchronousQueue，所以 AsyncTask 执行的任务为串行执行。而其 THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR 线程池又是静态的，所以不同 AsyncTask 对象会共用该线程池。所以我们应当避免使用 AsyncTask，尤其是在 sdk 开发中。
经过全局查找，发现项目内还有一个鉴权接口 B 也使用了 AsyncTask，所以该事故原因为，在网络环境较差时，接口 B 请求服务，会阻塞接口 A 请求, 导致客户统计耗时增加，最大耗时 2 * timeout。
方案
规范代码，使用统一的线程池。ThreadPoolSchedulers 就不细贴了，就是创建了一个 Executor
    asyncTask.executeOnExecutor(ThreadPoolSchedulers.io());

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从 2008 年开始，Widget 就一直是 Android 系统的一个重要组成部分，也是自定义主屏幕的一个重要方面。您可以将 Widget 理解为一个 "一目了然" 的应用视图，让用户在无需从主屏幕打开应用的前提下，就能对应用数据和核心功能一览无余。但是从 Android 推出至今，AppWidget 的 API 基本就没有什么大的变化，从 2012 年到 2021 年更是只有一个 Android 版本包含了对 AppWidget API 的更新。而随着 Android 12 的推出，也带来了 Widget API 一些亟需改进的更新。
本文我们就来介绍一下 Android 12 中带来了哪些关于 Widget API 的更新，以及有哪些好用的工具可以让开发应用 Widget 变得更加出色。如果您更喜欢通过视频了解此内容，请 点击此处 查看。
Widget 工作原理
Widget 运行在一个名为 AppWidgetHost 的远端进程中，比如 Home Screen Launcher，也正因如此，它的运行受到了一些限制。我们来看看 Widget 的工作原理。

在前端，应用首先注册 AppWidgetProvider 来定义 Widget 行为，以及注册 AppWidgetProviderInfo 来定义元数据。然后 AndroidManifest 引用这些信息，让操作系统通过 AndroidManifest 读取元数据，例如 Widget 初始的布局和默认尺寸，并提供 Widget 的预览，紧接着，provider 会使用链接账户来更新布局并对 Widget 进行更新。这里需要注意的是，应用于 Widget 的构建次数有限，所以操作系统是通过接收方的广播事件 (包含了更新信息) 对 Widget 进行更新，这也意味着 Widget 是定期接收来自应用的信息进行更新的。

前言
现代的 Android 项目都是 Gradle 工程，所以大家都习惯于用 Gradle Module 来划分和组织代码，Module 的大量使用也带来一个问题，一个大项目往往几十上百的 Module，但是当数量众多的 Module 之间的依赖关系不合理时，仍然会严重拖慢工程的编译速度，如何更科学地组织 Gradle Module 是 Android 开发领域的普遍需求。
从事 Android 开发的同学可能都听说过 Clean Architecture，即所谓整洁架构。Google 推荐大家使用它对 MVVM 进行更合理的分层。整洁架构的概念出自以下这本书（国内译本：代码整洁之道），关于这本书以及作者 Bob 大叔的大名这里就不多介绍了，说这是软件架构方面的圣经也不为过。

除了优化 MVVM 这样的业务架构，这本书在组件设计方面也产出了不少最佳实践和方法论，可用来优化 Gradle 这样的工程架构。本文就来讨论如何基于整洁架构中的各种设计原则来设计我们的 Gradle Module。
文章目录如下：
Module 粒度划分

复用发布等价原则（REP）
共同封闭原则（CCP）
共同复用原则（CRP）
三原则的权衡
Module 依赖关系

无环依赖原则（ADP）
稳定依赖原则（SDP）

稳定度公式
稳定抽象原则（SAP）

抽象度公式
不稳定度与抽象度的关系

痛苦区与无用区
总结
Module 粒度划分
参考 Clean Architecture 中对组件的定义：
组件是软件的部署单元，是整个软件系统在部署过程中可以独立完成部署的最小实体。例如，对于 Java 来说，它的组件是 jar 文件。而在 Ruby 中，它们是 gem 文件。在 .Net 中，它们则是 DLL 文件。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[多态
多态是编程语言支持的一种特性，这种特性使得静态的代码运行时可能产生动态的行为，这样一来编程时不需要为类型所烦恼，可以编写统一的处理逻辑而不是依赖特定的类型。”
在星巴克消费的时候就会发生多态，多态方便了顾客。不管是现金，支付宝，亦或是微信，顾客不需要关心每种支付背后的细节，只需递交支付工具即可。收银员是产生多态行为的关键，他把同样的递交行为在结账机上动态地和不同的支付方式做了对接。
深入结账机内部，假设它使用如下方式实现支付的多态：
class PayManager {
    fun pay(type: String){
        if (type == 现金){
            payByCash()
        } else if (type == 支付宝) {
            payByAli()
        } else if (type == 微信) {
            payByWechat()
        }
    }
}

通过 if-else 实现，其实称不上多态，而且这样实现会遇到不少麻烦。
if-else 之殇：无扩展性
新增支付方式时，得重新生产结账机。
因为if-else是在编译时新增行为，即当代码编译完成后，就生成了一张PayManager.pay()的 PDF 快照，它无法在运行时动态地改变，要新增行为就得重新编译，所以这种新增行为是静态的，无扩展性可言。
与 编译时新增行为 对应的是运行时新增行为，即当运行不同的上层代码，PayManager.pay()会表现出不同的行为（多态）。
策略模式就适用于当前场景，策略模式将具体的行为和行为的使用者隔离，当行为发生变化时，行为的使用者不需要随之而变。
// 用接口定义抽象支付行为
interface Pay {
    fun pay()
}

首先，作为少数派 Matrix 社区的新人作者，在新的一年里，向大家问好。
关注少数派很长时间了，有幸能看到这么多优秀的人和优秀的文章，也许是由于少数派是以科技和效率为主的网站，尽管在分享「生活方式」的文章中，有关「摩托」的话题也不是很多。（当然除了摩托罗拉），所以在这里我想和各位少数派的朋友分享一下「我为什么骑摩托车」。
不得不说，确实是刘德华主演的电影《烈火战车》给我埋下了摩托车的种子，但是在家人眼中，摩托车常常与「危险、浮躁、不正经」等贬义词挂钩。好在我从没提过想骑摩托车，所以也免去了在购买前和家人辩论的过程。
《烈火战车》剧照，图片来自豆瓣
随着近几年短视频的兴起，机车文化得到了一定的传播和发展，并且得益于各地「禁摩令」不同程度地取消，摩托车也成为了越来越多人的出行和生活方式，如果你也有兴趣入坑机车，那本文会有我的一些建议可供参考，另外为了提升易读性，本文不涉及动力、扭矩等参数。推荐入坑前可以关注「哈罗摩托」、「骑士网」等相关网站获取更专业的信息。如果有问题也可以直接在评论或私信中向我提问。
从复古车型到入手爱车
尽管很多摩友入坑的多数目的是追求速度与激情，但是我一直认为速度附带的刺激程度和危险系数是同等的，刺激和危险并不能形成对冲关系，所以在选购方面，我第一时间排除了仿赛车型（偏速度），只留意复古车型。

Cafe Racer 风格：分离式车把、瘦长的油箱、后置脚蹬、驼峰后座，这是独属于每个咖啡骑士的标志，咖啡骑士文化也应运而生。
Cafe Racer 风格机车
Bobber 风格：车身中心集中紧凑并且底矮，造型给人前冲的感觉，整体有力量感，改装风格是「能简则简」，「不必要就拆掉」也是该风格诞生之初最大的特点。

前言
了解过Compose的同学都知道，只需要添加一个@Compose注解就可以将函数转化成Compose函数，同时Compose函数也只能在Compose函数中运行。这看起来似乎跟协程比较像，@Compose是不是也像协程一样，往函数中添加了一些参数呢？
我们就一起来看下，@Compose到底做了什么，又是怎么做到的。
前置知识
一看到@Compose注解，我们很容易就想到注解处理器，但是@Compose的解析并不是通过注解处理器来实现的，因为注解处理器只能生成代码，不能修改代码
KCP（Kotlin Compiler Plugin）：即kotlin编译插件，支持跨平台，android开发可以将它类比为kapt+transform机制，既可以生成代码，也可以修改代码
@Compose注解的解析就是通过KCP来实现的
什么是KCP
Kotlin编译过程简单来说，就是将Kotlin源码编译成字节码的过程，具体步骤如下所示：

而Kotlin编译期插件则在编译过程中提供Hook时机，让我们可以解析符号，修改字节码生成结果等。
Kotlin库中的不少语法糖都用到了KCP，比如Kotlin-android-extension，@Parcelize等，@Compose注解同样也是通过KCP解析的
相比KAPT，KCP主要有以下优点：
KAPT是基于注解处理器的，它需要将Kotlin代码转化成Stub再解析注解生成代码，常常转化成Stub的时间比生成代码还要长，而KCP则是直接解析Kotlin的符号，因此在编译速度上KCP比KAPT要强的多
KAPT只能生成代码，不能修改代码，而KCP不仅可以生成代码，也可以修改代码，可以看作是kapt+transorm机制
而KCP的缺点则在于，KCP 的开发成本太高，涉及 …]]></summary>

回首2021，我所践行的生活信条用一个词形容，大概是「平衡」，这篇文章我将谈谈我的平衡生活方式理念、打造方法与各方面的收获感悟。文章较长，大家如果无法阅读完全文，可以大概扫一下各级标题和加粗文字，希望能够给你启发与共鸣。

为什么选择平衡
选择 平衡 or 极致，是一个价值观取向的问题，毕竟，life is all about trade-off，人生是一个取舍的过程。而就我个人而言，我不喜欢「all or nothing」的价值观，我更相信平衡才能走得更远。
极度的专注于某事确实能让人获得“专注红利”，可能给我们带来更高的回报，但另一方面，它也可能导致“管窥”心态，产生“隧道视野”，我们的视野变窄，那些存在于“管子”视野之外的事物被抑制了，其他重要但不紧急的事就会被我们搁置，譬如专注于工作而忽视身体与家人，等出现意外状况才发现得不偿失，在我看来，这样的生活方式是不具备反脆弱性的，就像投资，all in 押注于某一个标的，可能暴富也可能承受毁灭性打击。
我所理解的平衡生活
那平衡就是生活各个方面平均分配时间精力吗？并不是这样。我所理解的平衡生活，不是平均分配，而是把人生的各个重要方面拉入我们的视野，构成我们的日常生活，分配的比重可以根据我们的偏好与状态决定。虽然分配比例不一，但每一项都有一个最低限度需要达到，实际上在一些事务上我们只要坚持投入小的时间精力就能有不错的改善（帕累托法则），可以避免出现过度倾斜与失衡。
哪些是生活的重要方面？每个人的定义与分类都不同，以我自己为例。我在《一份个人复盘指南——成为更好的自己》中提到过一个生命之花模型，将生活分为了8个板块：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、前言
结构型模式(Structural Pattern)描述如何将类或者对象结合在一起形成更大的结构，就像搭积木，可以通过简单的组合形成复杂的、功能更为强大的结构。
结构型模式的实现可以分为两种，类结构型模式和对象结构型模式，其中：
类结构型模式关心类的组合，由多个类可以组合成一个更大的系统，在类结构型模式中一般只存在继承关系和接口实现关系。
对象结构型模式关心类与对象的组合，通过关联关系使得在一个类中定义另一个类的实例对象，然后通过该对象调用其方法。根据“合成复用原则”，在系统中尽量使用关联关系来替代继承关系，因此大部分结构型模式都是对象结构型模式。
本文将会介绍几种常见的结构型模式，他们分别是：
享元模式(Flyweight)
代理模式(Proxy)
装饰模式(Decorator)
适配器模式(Adapter)
桥接模式(Bridge)
外观模式(Facade)
同时，为了更加方便的理解结构型模式的设计思想，本文将加入一个项目阶段的概念：
开发中，也包含开发前期，一般是代码未发布可以随意更改的阶段
开发完成，已发布/封装完成，或是没有源码，只能补救的阶段
不同的开发阶段所能适用的设计模式也不同，在理解设计者的意图时，这一点尤其重要
另外，本篇文章是笔者个人对结构型模式的理解，由于结构型模式的概念有些抽象(相较于创建型模式)，每个人的理解也不尽相同，因此，若您发现笔者的描述有不准确甚至完全错误的地方，请到这里进行反馈，感谢
二、结构型模式：享元模式
1、模式定义
享元模式(又称蝇量模式)是对象池的一种实现，它的英文名称叫做Flyweight，代表轻量级的意思。
享元模式用来尽可能减少内存使用量，它适合用于可能存在大量重复对象的场景，来缓存可共享的对象，达到对象共享、避免创建过多对象的效果，这样一来就可以提升性能，是典型的以空间换时间的设计模式。
享元模式的设计思想比较…]]></summary>

PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛
起因
新年要来了，看电影是我们新年中必不可少的娱乐项目，那么看电影的时候你是否有想过选座位的空间是如何实现的呢，今天就带你研究。
compose的绘制系列在两个月前就已经学习完成了，但是仅限于api的熟练，因此今天打算做一个仿淘票票选电影座位的自定义ui。
效果查看
先看一下支付宝客户端的实现吧

我们发现选座位的主要点就是座位的绘制、选择座位的逻辑、双指手势缩放、单指长按后拖动效果
既然说到这里了提取吧我们实现的效果也放出来吧：

实现要点
绘制座位
本身绘制座位我么可以使用drawRoundRect api来实现，不过为了增加难度本例中我是使用path拼接而成的座位。这样做的目标也是为了方便将来将座位扩展成其它形状
构建path的代码：
val path = Path().apply {
        moveTo(boundStart.x, boundStart.y + radius)
        addArc(//绘制圆弧
            Rect(Offset(boundStart.x + radius, boundStart.y + radius), radius),
            180f,
            90f,
        )
        lineTo(boundEnd.x - radius, boundStart.y)
        arcTo(
            Rect(Offset(boundEnd.x - radius, boundStart.y + radius), radius),
            270f,
            90f,
            false
        )
        lineTo(boundEnd.x, boundEnd.y - radius)
        arcTo(Rect(Offset(boundEnd.x - radius, boundEnd.y - radius), radius), 0f, 90f, false)
        lineTo(boundStart.x + radius, boundEnd.y)
        arcTo(Rect(Offset(boundStart.x + radius, boundEnd.y - radius), radius), 90f, 90f, false)
        close()
    }

drawpath：
drawPath(
        path,
        if (seat.type == 0) Color(0xfff4d9bd) else Color(0xffc3d9e9),
        style = Stroke(strokeWidth)//使用Stroke可以保证我们的path绘制出来是线妆的效果
    )

双指操作手势
手势的使用可以参考之前我写过的文章，传送门
使用双指手势需要使用如下两个Modifier操作符：
.graphicsLayer
.transformable(state = state)

实现代码如下：
 var scale by remember { mutableStateOf(1f) }
    var offset by remember { mutableStateOf(Offset.Zero) }
    val state = rememberTransformableState { zoomChange, offsetChange, rotationChange ->
        scale *= zoomChange
        offset += offsetChange
    }
    Box(
        Modifier
            .fillMaxSize(),

        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
    ) {
       内容部分
       ....
    }

从解码渲染层面对比 PAG 与 lottie
最近由于业务需求，需要调研一下业界的知名动画渲染框架。经过一些时间的调研与探索，我将目光聚焦在两款不错的动画框架上。一款是知名的 lottie，一款是腾讯出品的 PAG。
lottie 相信大部分端上的研发都会或多或少的听过， lottie 是 airbnb 开源的一款业界知名的开源动画框架,通过 AE 制作动画之后，通过附带的插件 bodymovin 导出 动画的 json 文件，端上再通过 json 解析渲染。
lottie 不单单包含端上的渲染 SDK，其实是一套完整的动画制作工作流。
PAG（Portable Animated Graphics）是腾讯自主研发的一套完整的动画工作流解决方案。
我会通过以下几点的调研来评估哪个框架对于我们的业务而言是更好的选择。
工作流
我们先来看一下使用 lottie 的简单流程。
​

PAG 的流程。
​

从两个框架的流程图可以看出，工作流大体相似，如
由 AE 生成动画
附带 AE 插件，可以通过插件导出动画
lottie 的 bodymovin
PAG 的 PAG Exporter
预览
导出文件
端上的渲染 SDK
配置文件
工作流两者大体相似。所以我将注意力放在了两者中很显著的不同点。即 AE 导出的配置文件。
lottie 选择了 json
PAG 选择了类似于 protocolbuff 的自研二进制文件。
本篇文章会着重从配置文件的大小和解析性能等角度来分析两者的性能。
lottie 的 json 配置文件与 PAG 二进制配置文件
先看一个简单动画。

动画大致流程如下：
0s 至 3s，scale 属性值从 100% 变到 50%。
3s 至 6s，scal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个系列的文章，是笔者和朋友在30天自驾环游中国西线时候所发生的故事。希望你能从我们的故事中获得一些有用的信息。也希望这些旅途中的见闻和思考能带动各位观众和读者能够自己去探索自己旅途中的故事。
本期我们主要讲述一下，解决完矛盾之后我们前往广西的所见所闻，本篇我们讲述的时间线是2021年1月15日-1月16日，承接上一个篇章，即我们在渡轮上发生矛盾之后的事情。由于我们也知道当天是没有办法在拍摄到日出了，所以我们就直接不去桂林了，而是直接前往了阳朔西街，在阳朔西街逗留了片刻，然后去相公山住宿，第二天拍摄一下相公山的山水景色。在本篇中，你将会获取一些我们在阳朔西街和相公山两个地方的一些信息，虽然会有些碎片化，但是还是正在阅读的你们能够获取到一些有用的信息，在未来能够应用到自己的旅行中去。
本系列在B站上也做了视频，如果大家喜欢影音接收信息的话，可以移步到B站观看我们的视频栏目，如果你是偏好文字的读者，在这里你也可以获取我们的节目内容，这里也可以看成是对视频做的一种笔记。

本文采取核心内容+感性叙述的方式来展现，文章的前半部分主要分享核心的信息点给大家，文章的后半部分主要从我个人的视角来叙述内容和过程，感性部分比较多。大家可以根据自己的阅读偏好，来选择阅读到哪里。
当日计划
2021年1月15日，我们从徐闻港的渡轮下来之后，已经是当天的12点半，准备好出发已经将近一点钟。得益于上一期矛盾的解决，我和“不可”在那之后的行动方案非常统一。于是我们商量好，当天15号的任务是，放弃桂林的日落，直接去阳朔西街看看，毕竟已经来不及赶到桂林了。在完成阳朔西街的游历后，当天晚上直接去到相公山住下，第二天爬山，然后拍一些山水风景的画面。
“不可”也表示同意，服从安排。于是我们当…]]></summary>

钱浩：《是什么让我们难以领略音乐的艺术》

音乐是我们生活中不可或缺的事物，但是人们对于音乐的理解总是欠缺的。这种缺憾在于我们对音乐的认知与了解实在有限。对于音乐的各类术语——调性、节奏、曲式等，我们实在很难说出一二三来，这就使得我们在很多情况下无法辨别音乐的“好坏”。我记得Mr.Miss的杜凯在节目结束之后，曾说自己受到很大打击：自己认为最好的作品反向平平（《你怎么不上天呢》），但自己无奈加入专辑中的糊口作品却受到观众的喜爱（秋别）。而钱浩在书中给读者给出了一个问题的答案，就是我们如何学习欣赏音乐的作品，尤其是更为复杂的音乐作品。
在我看来，作者最有价值的地方在于点出了我们欣赏范式的陈旧，以及我们对于旋律的执着。书中举的例子主要是古典乐。为何古典乐的门槛高？在某种程度上，它的艺术创作动机是非自然的，所以需要一定的练习才能欣赏。一如，我们需要学习才能理解人类的某个方向上的钻研与突破。作者在书中强烈推荐读者一定要学习“和声学”，而我也在这种“学习”的思路下，买了后浪出版的大部头——[美] 罗杰·凯密恩的《听音乐》。
其实，在十多年前，当年的好朋友曾送给我一本《All of Music》（好像是这一本），但是我却一直未曾读过，惭愧惭愧。
刘勃：《司马迁的记忆之野》《失败者的春秋》

刘勃的历史文化随笔，非常接地气，同时又非常具有现代性。从阅读的友好度来说，刘勃的作品算是十分不错的科普读物。去年读了这个系列写作中的两本，阅读体验都非常好。在读库的作者群中，刘勃的作品总给人带来一些惊喜。作为一个历史作家，刘勃作品中的文学性是专业研究者在面向大众写作时需要学习的部分。一如在2021年过世的史景迁，以一种非虚构的文学性的创作手法，来展现自己的历史研究。
有关历史的作品，总是会吸引我们读下去的。大家的“吃瓜”心理不仅会投射在现代人物上，也会投射在历史人物身上，从两千年前到现在，…]]></summary>

从日本综艺的小窗口 wipe 演出，到各路吃播、热剧、综艺、舞台，甚至当你点进一个直播间，主播都有可能正在看别的主播直播，再附加自己的点评......这种双视窗画面的视频对当下的我们来说并不陌生。在此文中，我们将其称为反应类视频（Reaction video）。
本文将反应类视频的生产与观众的互动当作一类互联网文化实验，试图分析上传者的诉求，以及在“Watching People Watching People Watching”链条背后的受众心态。
一个关于蛋炒饭的 Reaction 视频，怎么就引发了全网议论？
似乎很难想到，一碗蛋炒饭也能够成为学术研究的对象。在刚刚过去的11月，武汉大学媒体发展研究中心推送了国内跨文化传播学者的一篇研究论文，在其中，对炒饭教程的 reaction 视频被比喻成为“参与式狂欢”的样本，助推了一起典型跨文化事件在舆论场上的发酵与热议。
一顿香喷喷的蛋炒饭，怎么就激发了东西文化差异的争论？先让我们将时钟拨回两年前，缕情事情的来由。
故事最初发生在2019年4月，当时 BBC Food 频道在 Facebook 上发布了一条4分钟的炒饭视频。视频中，印度美食博主 Hersha Patel 展示着从煮饭到滤水，再到炒饭出锅的全过程，起初并没有受到太多讨论。
而在一年多之后，一名马来西亚华裔喜剧演员 Nigel Ng 在自己的 Youtube 上发布了一则 Reaction 视频，直指原视频里的做法“不正宗”，完全是“老外蛋炒饭”。在视频里，他坐在桌子前，与电脑中的视频画面同步做出各种或惊讶或“槽多无口”的表情。
例如，在最初加水的环节，观众就能感受到博主小哥的“暴躁”：他一边紧盯着自己的手指，一边说“为什么用英国茶杯量水？要用手指量啊！”

当看到美食博主用滤网沥米饭的时候，Ng 的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢“用产品思维解构生活”的，花生酱。你也可以叫我Jeff。
2022年的我，是一枚7岁的产品经理，也是一个公众号的主理人，同时还是一名效率产品领域的作家。我曾对信息获取、方法论总结如痴如狂，却从未对“获得信息”感到满足。
截止到去年，我已经读了产品领域90%的书籍，订阅了500+公众号及付费阅读产品，并且还在持续每周花50小时在电子设备上摄取内容。但我仍然觉得空虚，焦虑，以及，不满足。
海量的信息在我脑海飘过，我害怕错失任何一点点“有用”的部分，试图抓住全部，却几乎遗忘了全部。
但最近半年，我好多了。
我重新审视了自己的工具、方法，以及自己对信息的期待、和信息的关系，进而找到了一些蛛丝马迹，并进一步对自己的“效率生活”进行了重构，终于和“信息处理”步入了近乎“握手言和”的阶段。
所以，这篇文章，想讲讲这一路的心得，供君参考。
从“刚下飞机”聊起
不记得什么时候开始，“刚下飞机”，已经成为了一个经典的时间点。
这种叙事来自于：“万物互联”和“移动化”这两件事，已经把我们的生活搬到了飞速向前的生产线滑轨上。而“飞机上”这个断网的环境，或许是现阶段共识的、唯一可以打破这种互联的场景。所以“刚下飞机”这样的表述，多多少少表现出，我们对“飞速向前和海量信息”的应对方式（至少我），是略显被动和僵硬的。
信息太多，没有办法专心。概念太多，没有办法熟悉。更多的情况下，我们被“无限降低的注意力门槛”拖着走，看着最热内容里面一个个光鲜的“头部案例”，感觉自己知晓了一切，而自己的生活却仍是马太效应中的长尾典型。
信息从脑海中穿堂而过，不留丝毫停歇。而人本身，更像是一个站在白雾茫茫中，吹着四面八方来风的旗子，四处飘扬，等于没在飘扬。
本能的反应是，我们要追逐效率。只要处理得够快，信息就追不上我们。
我们试图用工具和方法论，让自己快速清理掉这些信息。比如试图用“5秒的短视频”…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自从 Struggle with Me 开始关注记笔记这个话题， 我们经常收到朋友们关于如何记笔记的问题。粗略概括一下，这些问题大概分为三类：

我也试过记笔记，但是对我没什么帮助。记笔记到底有什么用呢？
我发现记笔记对我是有帮助的，但是很麻烦，效果也没有大家说得那么神奇。记笔记到底怎样才能简单又高效呢？
我看了不少人的笔记经验介绍都觉得特别好，但自己一用就觉得不顺手。怎样打造一套适合自己的简单又高效的笔记系统呢？

这篇文章就结合我们这几年记笔记的心得，简要地回答这几个问题。希望能帮到对记笔记有疑惑的朋友。
一、记笔记有什么用？
没用的笔记各有各的没用，有用的笔记只需做到两件事：收集和整理。收集帮助我们清空大脑，专注当下；整理帮助我们连接笔记，加速知识的积累和碰撞。
收集
收集，就是把我们所有的想法都捡起来放在一起。
我周边很多朋友都对收集自己的想法嗤之以鼻。大学的时候有一位朋友会在酒席饭桌上随时掏出笔记本来写两句。周围的人都笑他：你是天才嘛？有什么灵感必须这会儿记下来？这是好多人都有的思维误区。大家以为只有天才需要随时随地记笔记；因为只有天才才有灵感，而只有灵感才值得记录。其实，值得记下来的不仅仅是灵感。最需要记笔记的或许不是天才，而是我们这些普通人。
我们可以试着先问一下自己，忙碌的间隙，我们都想了些什么呢？好多人会说：「我在想今天吃什么。」没错，大脑就是天生的规划狂魔，无时不刻不在设想下一步该做什么。所以我们很多有意无意的想法都跟未来有关，包括但不限于计划、提醒、担心和问题。而所谓的灵感，通常只占其中很小的一部分。反倒是那些琐碎的计划、提醒、担心、问题等等占据了我们的大脑。只有把这些琐碎的念头都记下来，我们的大脑才能轻装上阵。
举两个啰嗦的例子做对比，方便大家明白。
例子一，没有收集想法的工作日上午。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最初的标题是「试论学习效率」，但仔细一想又觉得技巧与工具大同小异，讲与效率相关的拖延症也是老生常谈。因此在这里试图抛砖引玉，探讨这个至今我难以解答的问题：为什么我们会对有关「提高效率」，「提升自我」这一课题无法自拔。
为什么关注效率？
首先，为什么要关心效率？自我反省下来，原因不多：

人一生的时间是有限的。
每个人的一天都是24个小时
为了在更短的时间内，比别人学得更多，然后获得某种意义上的胜利。

最后一点的无奈之处在于，只有「更多」才能在他人面前表现出来。因为即便是浅层的理解，通常在面试和聊天环境下也不会过于深入的讨论。
但是我们都清楚， 质量更为重要。
高效率 = 完成更多；高效率 ≠ 高质量？
在这集 How to Structure Your Writing Day with Francesco Cirillo @ Become a Writer Today 播客里，主持人邀请了番茄钟的创始人来分享他对时间管理的看法：「我们应该把时间看作朋友而不是敌人，否则就失去了对自我的掌控。」
在博客里，他分享了番茄钟常见的错误使用：

设置超长番茄钟：把一个番茄钟的时常限制在40分钟以内的原因是为了能让今天的第一个番茄钟和最后一个番茄钟能进行同等质量的工作。
忽视短休息的重要性：人们通常跳过短休息，亦或者在休息期间没有放空大脑（依旧想着手头上的事）。

产生这两个错误的原因归根结底其实就是害怕会打断心流，害怕我们要因为重新酝酿（或等待）「动力」而浪费时间，但是往往这么做反而让自身在工作面前失去了掌控力。因为当你开始害怕被打断时，时间就成为了你的敌人，而你要让时间成为你的盟友。
在 Paul Graham 的 博客 How to Work Hard 里提到，努力最重要的是质量，时间（effort）和天赋（talent）占比不大。这与卡尔·纽波特的《深度工作》核心观点一致，其…]]></summary>

一. Android渲染知识
1.1 绘制原理
Android系统要求每一帧都要在 16ms 内绘制完成，平滑的完成一帧意味着任何特殊的帧需要执行所有的渲染代码（包括 framework 发送给 GPU 和 CPU 绘制到缓冲区的命令）都要在 16ms 内完成，保持流畅的体验。这个速度允许系统在动画和输入事件的过程中以约 60 帧每秒（ 1秒 / 0.016帧每秒 = 62.5帧/秒 ）的平滑帧率来渲染。

如果你的应用没有在 16ms 内完成这一帧的绘制，假设你花了 24ms 来绘制这一帧，那么就会出现掉帧的情况。

系统准备将新的一帧绘制到屏幕上，但是这一帧并没有准备好，所有就不会有绘制操作，画面也就不会刷新。反馈到用户身上，就是用户盯着同一张图看了 32ms 而不是 16ms ，也就是说掉帧发生了。
1.2 掉帧
掉帧是用户体验中一个非常核心的问题。丢弃了当前帧，并且之后不能够延续之前的帧率，这种不连续的间隔会容易会引起用户的注意，也就是我们常说的卡顿、不流畅。引起掉帧的原因非常多，比如：
花了非常多时间重新绘制…]]></summary>

前言
这次更新进度时间间隔有点长，主要原因呢，找可用的API数据源，这玩意竟然占了耗时大头……最终效果还未知，到时候再说吧……另外，由于阅读器模块的基本结束，所以开发方向转向整体APP开发，所以设计搭建框架，选择合适的辅助工具，思考该做成什么样子，也占用了一定时间；
当然以上不是为了给天天摸🐟 找借口，你们要信我啊；
回正题，在APP设计上，我想在首页上仿Soul的那个星球效果来做个推荐页面，这次就来实践一下
设计
首先呢，搜了下 github 好像并没有相关的Flutter控件可以直接拿来用，不过如果放宽到 Android 上面，倒是有一大批，那么这块实现方案也不用自己设计了，直接照抄就完事了；
不过抄的过程中，发现这玩意好像也没那么好抄～～抄这玩意的第一件事，是翻出曾经的数学课本，预习一下向量和空间坐标这部分的东西；
不过所幸，核心原理其实不复杂，用一句话就能说明：
全程围绕 罗德里格旋转矢量公式 来搞，通过更新向量、旋转角度，并带进公式中，就能实现需要的效果；
实现与踩坑
实现部分：
在实现方式上：使用的是 Stack 做主体，结合 Transform 来处理位移、缩放、透明度等部分；其build方法就这样：

在 initState 的时候初始化AnimationController，通过设置监听器的方式调用 setState 来更新UI：

计算逻辑就是用那个公式来搞就完事了：

一些小坑
虽然上面说的挺轻松的样子，但是其中还是遇到了一些小坑需要处理：
由于引入了Z轴的概念，所以正如第一张图中注释说的那样，要根据Z轴重新排个序，来正确处理点击事件等部分；

手势竞争这块还有个小问题，由于最外层是一个TabBarView，所以是可以左右滑动的，而星球本身是可以任意方向拖动的，由此带来了一个横向的手势冲突问题：
这个问题的解决方法有很多，不过我使用的是修改Pan手势竞争器判断阈值的方式来做的处理，用这种做法的人应该比较少吧：

结语
现在来看下效果：

好像debug模式下在30fps左右，虽说及格线吧，但是明显手动拖动的时候好很多，可能也是20张图片+transform有点多？也有可能图片这块可以做下优化？后续看看profile模式下的表现，分析下表现耗时再看看；
这次看看标题写的装逼点，效果咋样，不过可没做标题党，说300行就300行，没有故意压缩行数，用的AS的通用代码模版，甚至到最后还有一点空余：]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引子
在文章的开始，若要简单讲述我要叙说的「在地感」关于什么，是不需耗费多少笔墨的：它的核心即为强调人与特定生活场景的联系，以达到「在此地，做某事，生何情」的状态。我们或许听说过「不要在卧室做别的事情，有助于快速入睡」的生活实用贴士，也听说过 「 自由职业的危险主要来自于床和桌子离得太近  」 的段子，常常涉及的「工作和生活分区」就是我要讲述的「在地感」的其中一个部分。
在将近两年有意无意的尝试中，我已经基本建立了自己的一套系统和模式。在我的观念中，「在地感（A Sense of Place）」的营造不仅仅局限于地理空间与空间设置，而有意识地使用设备、注重设备使用方法和频繁自我沟通同样是可行的好办法。
本文将探讨我对于将「在地感」引入个人生活尤其数字生活的缘起和经历。注意：该名称并非本意即指这样的生活管理方法论，而类似于“工作生活分区”这样的思想也早就存在，我试图做到的是用该术语代指更为概括化的此类方法论，从而让其适用更为广泛，形成一个类似于「数字极简」、「低碳生活」等有明确所指的简洁词汇，便于分享与实行。
写作本篇文章时，正处于西安封城期间，在公寓里有限的空间里我通过这种意识，还算没有失去正常生活的节奏：这种节奏感无论于心理健康还是生活趣味都极为关键。我将会在简单阐述这种意识后，说一说我是如何实际操作并且从中受益的。

 
那么究竟什么是「在地感」？
「Sense of Place」在维基百科中文词条显示为「 场所感 」。它在各个学科、不同领域均有相似内核而具备不同细节的内涵，而我最初接触该术语起源于文化遗产管理领域。在文化遗产管理中，人们会对于文化遗产的所在地具备情感、故事、私人联系，以及围绕着场景产生的故事；而在 2012 年，有 学者 提出，在环境心理学中人们通常对于地点具备依恋感（attachment），并且使地点具备其意义。
在我眼中，人与社会具备相对健康的联系…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。
进入12月后，勇士队遭遇了一波进攻寒潮。11月，他们还能打出114.8分的百回合得分，而到了12月就只剩下了110.5分，在1月的三场比赛中更是低到了107.4分。相应地，球队核心库里也“难辞其咎”，个人百回合得分从11月的116.4分跌落到了12月的112.1、1月的110.2分，真实命中率更是从63.9%跌到了58.1%，1月份更是惨不忍睹的39.4%。
对于造成勇士和库里如此下滑的原因，首先当然是库里个人的消耗问题。本赛季，库里在每回合之中、特别是进攻端的移动距离，比之17-18、18-19赛季，都有了一定的上涨。在曾经的勇士2.0时代，库里已经是一个拥有大量无球跑动、不断进行换位移动的进攻手，而本赛季的他则在本已不小的跑动量上进一步提高，来到了后卫中进攻跑动第九多的位置，且年过三十的年龄，也在加兰、科尔安东尼、德章泰穆雷等一众年轻人之中，显得格外突出。而在防守端，由于勇士一贯采取的集体换防策略，库里的跑动量自然也不会少，18-19赛季就有着后卫中第八多的防守移动，而本赛季也只是相对下降了0.07米。况且，我们还需要考虑到库里为了增强防守对位能力而采取的增重，对身体造成更大的负担。

年龄的增加、体重的上升、移动的剧化，随着赛季的深入，这些问题逐渐开始影响库里，拉低了他的表现稳定性。这是每一个核心球星都必然面对的生涯阶段，出现波动，并不算非常离奇。而在此前的赛程中，勇士队也及时地找到了能为库里排忧解难、分担压力的替代者，乔丹普尔成为了球队的二号持球手，策动了相当比例的挡拆回合，也成为了比威少之于詹姆斯来得性价比远高的解压存在。
然而，这样的良好趋势，却在12月开始，特别是到了1月份的几场比赛，开始出现了裂痕。对此，我们可以从阵容搭配中的变量来做初步把握。球队进攻最为气势如虹的11月，乔丹普尔场均拥有31.5分钟的出场时间，14.7次出手，…]]></summary>

砸了你们！砸啦！
兔子都知道不吃窝边草
三百多个人，转头你们就发布了新车
还换了名字
呸！恶心
我都降价清库存
这种事儿你们可以花点儿钱嘛
花点儿
哪怕送点儿礼品呢
花不了多少钱！
哪怕卖期货呢
简直就是土匪，土匪都不如
还说让人家车主念你们好
就是一句话！恶心！
钱肯定是挣不着啦
恶心！恶心！

好了，抖机灵结束，回归正题。
与2021款理想One上市时刚买了老款的车主维权类似，这两件事的背后其实都反映了同一个问题——在脱离了传统的4S店销售模式后，新入局的玩家们如何在销售端处理好新老车型交替。
问题根源是没处理好车型新老交替时的销售策略
传统车企是怎么做的
俗话说“早买早享受，晚买有折扣”。
以往，传统车企在新款车型上市前夕，一般都会对店内库存的老款车型进行降价促销，用0库存来迎接新车的到来，否则新车上市后老车就砸手里了。
比如在新款奥迪A3上市前，老款A3的裸车价一度低至14万。
等新款上市后，初期一直都保持着20万的价格，即使到现在，最低报价也仍然在18万左右。
因此，虽然新A3相比老A3升级了很多内容，但是买老A3的用户看在6万块的差价上也不会觉得自己亏了。
当然，也有部分车型销量异常的好，直至生命周期末尾可能都没有优惠，但是这类车待新款上市后往往都需要加价排队提车。
所以老款还是会比新款便宜。
新势力们有哪些区别
但是随着越来越多的新势力入局之后，原先“车厂——4S店；4S店——用户”的交付链路变成了如今的“车厂——直营店/app——用户”。
车辆的终端售价也由原先“车企和4S店共同决定”变成了现在的“车企单独决定”。
但是为了保持品牌形象，新势力往往又不会主动选择在老款车型即将停产时降价。
再加上如今随着电动化、智能化的快速发展，汽车更新换代速度也明显要比以前快得多，消费者根本想不到一台车这么快就会成为老款。
这两个因素一叠加，在新款上市之际原价买了老款的用户自然觉得自己是被割了韭菜。
所以对于选择直营的企业来说，如果管理好用户的预期非常重要。
是不是所有新势力都没处理好？
也并不是，比如蔚来在这方面我认为还是处理得不错的。
一方面，蔚来通过“卖期货”这种方式让潜在消费者了解自己在未来半年或一年内的产品发布规划，防止打用户一个措手不及。
比如蔚来在2021年一月份就发布了ET7，并且开放了预定，而直到2022年1月才启动锁单。
对于ET7的潜在用户来说，如果在这期间看上了别的车，随时可以退预定金；而对于预定现有NT1.0产品的用户，他们也一定是在权衡了新技术和早提车之后才做出了选择。
另一方面，虽然蔚来不会主动调整车辆指导价，但是当现有老款车型竞争力不足时，蔚来会采用置换补贴、贴息以及其他商业优惠来变相降价。
因此，直营并不代表就无法妥善处理新老交替导致的销售问题。
售后问题
至于售后，老车主们还真不用太担心，毕竟赛力斯只是改了个名字，运营主体并没有变。
问界就是赛力斯，赛力斯就是问界。

前言
刚把 MVC , MVP , MVVM 深入理解了一波,最近又开始各种推送 MVI 的文章,碰巧谷歌又发布了最新的 Android应用架构指南 ,大致看了下发现正式最近正火的 MVI ！这可真是巧巧的妈妈生巧巧,于是上手实践了一下,只能说有规范就是好,真香
指南帮助我解决了以前开发过程中遇到的很多疑惑点,再也不怕和小伙伴争论了,直接指南怼脸，舒坦
架构概述
最新架构基于 界面和数据分离 和 数据模型驱动界面 两个原则,将应用分为三层

其中最主要的是 界面层 和 数据层
界面层
职责
将应用数据转换为界面数据,显示在UI上
提供状态容器(ViewModel)
处理界面事件
重点
业务逻辑和界面逻辑
业务逻辑决定着如何处理状态变化。业务逻辑通常位于网域层或数据层中，但绝不能位于界面层中。
界面行为逻辑(界面逻辑) 决定着如何在屏幕上显示状态变化。例如点击按钮跳转,消息提示等
界面逻辑（尤其是在涉及 Context 等界面类型时）应位于界面中，而非ViewModel中.
同一应用的业务逻辑在不同移动平台或设备类型上保持不变，但界面行为逻辑在实现方面可能有所不同。界面层页定义了这些类型的逻辑
界面事件处理
事件划分
界面事件：应在界面层处理的操作
用户事件：用户在与应用互动时生成的事件
ViewModel 通常负责处理特定用户事件的业务逻辑
事件决策树

如果操作是在界面树中比较靠下一层生成的，例如在 RecyclerView 项或自定义 View 中，ViewModel 应仍是处理用户事件的操作。
界面状态和状态容器
界面状态
界面状态需要包含界面显示的全部信息
界面状态定义不可变
只有数据源或数据所有者才应负责更新其公开的数据
状态容器
负责提供界面状态，并且包含执行相应任务所必需的逻辑。状态容器有多种大小…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小伙伴们应该都知道，UI绘制优化是性能优化中非常重要的一部分，因为用户在使用应用过程的中，优秀的交互体验是我们留住用户不可或缺的一部分。如果说设计美观舒适的交互是产品经理与UI设计师的工作，那么如何将交互实现则是攻城狮们要做的咯，而UI绘制优化的原因则是为了给用户带去丝滑般的使用体验而进行的。
一、绘制原理
在Android中，每个View都有三个固定的核心步骤，并依次去执行。它们分别是measure、layout以及draw，通过Measure和Layout来确定当前需要绘制的View所在的大小和位置，再通过绘制（Draw）到surface。measure、layout和draw方法主要是运行在系统的应用框架层，而真正将数据渲染到屏幕上的则是系统Nativie层的SurfaceFlinger服务来完成的。
1.1 应用层
Measure
用深度优先原则递归得到所有视图（View）的宽、高；获取当前View的正确宽度childWidthMeasureSpec和高度childHeightMeasureSpec之后，可以调用它的成员函数Measure来设置它的大小。如果当前正在测量的子视图child是一个视图容器，那么它又会重复执行操作，直到它的所有子孙视图的大小都测量完成为止。
Layout
位置计算的递归原理跟测量的差不多，用深度优先原则递归得到所有视图（View）的位置；当一个子View在应用程序窗口左上角的位置确定之后，再结合它在前面测量过程中确定的宽度和高度，就可以完全确定它在应用程序窗口中的布局。
Draw
目前Android支持了两种绘制方式：软件绘制（CPU）和硬件加速（GPU），其中硬件加速在Android 3.0开始已经全面支持，很明显，硬件加速在UI的显示和绘制的效率远远高于CPU绘制，但硬件加速并非如大家所想的那么完善，它也存在明显的缺点：

本周话题：一个程序员的财务独立之路
本周，推荐一篇美国程序员的文章。
作者20岁时第一次当实习生，发现在 IT 行业，普通人有可能在30多岁就实现"财务独立"，不再为维持生计和支付日常账单而劳碌。以前，他一直以为每个人都需要工作到退休。
从此，他就将财务独立作为自己的人生目标。

2009年，他大学毕业了，没有任何积蓄，进入英特尔公司担任初级工程师。当时的年薪是10万美元，年支出3.8万美元，再扣掉税，第一年就有了3.5万美元的净资产。
以后，他每年都记账。在这篇文章里面，他公开了收入和支出（见下表）。十二年以后的2021年，他已经是亚马逊的高级工程师，年薪62.5万美元（含股票），年支出7.8万美元，净资产达到了240万美元（含股票）。

他详细说了，自己怎么经过十二年的奋斗，在35岁做到财务独立，我觉得很有借鉴意义。
（1）首要的努力方向，就是追求工资提升。 普通人的收入来源，主要还是本职工作，如果工资很低，根本不可能实现财务独立，所以必须想方设法提高工资。
一般来说，大厂的高级职位可以拿到稳定的高工资。所以，他要求自己一定要进大厂，并且做到高级工程师。
（2）每过三年，就到别处面试。 他一般三年换一家公司，这样可以获得显著的加薪和晋升。他说每次换公司，收入至少增加30%。另外，还可以让自己始终拥有一种进取的心态，不断…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[市面上常见的摄像头悬浮窗，如微信、手机QQ的视频通话功能，有如下特点：
整屏页面能切换到一个小的悬浮窗
悬浮窗能运行在其他app上方
悬浮窗能跳回整屏页面，并且悬浮窗消失
我们探讨过用CameraX打开摄像头预览，结合可改变大小和浮动的activity，实现了应用内摄像头预览悬浮Activity。这个悬浮Activity是在应用内使用的。要让悬浮窗在其他app上，需要结合悬浮窗 System Alert Window。
本文用CameraX实现摄像头预览悬浮窗，能显示在其他app上方，可拖动，可跳回activity。

这个例子的相关代码放进了单独的模块。使用时注意gradle里的细微差别。
引入依赖

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面
老实说这篇年终总结一开始写得并不顺利，一直没有什么好的思路。
简单回忆了一下 2021 年经历的几件大事：跳槽、离职旅行、搬家、爷爷去世。现在心境相比 2021 年初已经有了很大的改变，可能这就是所谓的「成长」吧。
这次打算用「重新认识自己」——「继续热爱生活」——「做自己」——「变优秀」——「学会和自己和解」来组成这篇年终总结。
重新认识自己
工作
在 2021 年的 6 月我结束了毕业后的第一份工作，选择从国企离职，进入了一家互联网公司。国企与互联网带给我的工作体验是完全不一样的，详情写在了这里：从国企到互联网，一个初入职场将近一年半工作经验程序员的「得」与「失」。
但在新公司待了快半年，意识到其实自己也不喜欢现在的这份工作。因为带自己的 mentor 被裁，导致自己平时工作遇到难点几乎找不到同事寻求帮助，一而再地受到打击，得不到工作上的成就感，渐渐地自己开始厌倦现在这份工作以及这个职业。其实自己也知道，又有多少人真正喜欢工作呢，打工还不是为了混口饭吃。但是我觉得自己还年轻，还想多尝试尝试。
想起来之前和一位朋友讨论过职业规划的问题，我觉得大部分人没有一定阅历是规划不出什么的，因为不知道自己真正喜欢的是什么，但是不规划怎么又能有丰富的阅历做支撑呢。我觉得这是一个悖论，唯一的解决方法是有一个你信得过且对你很了解的前辈告诉你应该选什么方向做什么类型的工作，但是这样就不是自己的人生了。
比如我之前在国企，做的是 ToG 相关的工作，经历过后发现一点也不喜欢条条框框的限制。现在在一家互联网公司做内部系统开发，氛围很自由，只是当前的工作内容并不太喜欢。
但依然没有想好自己真正想做什么，可能还是不敢勇敢迈出那一步吧。还需要多找些行业前辈进行交流与请教，过来人的经验真的很有用。最近和一位做产品的朋友交流，意识到各行各业都没有外人看上去那么光鲜亮丽，不要抱有太高的期望，结果往…]]></summary>

靠着长达一年的马屁，我成了导师的得意门生。
谁料，我却在庆功宴上喝多，当众亲了他儿子。
1.
我的研究生导师，是业界响当当的大牛。
一年多的鞍前马后，我终于成了他的“得意门生”。
但就在一场庆功宴上，我喝高了。
“明教授，有这样的成果全仰仗您的指导，您就是我再生父亲。啊不，亲爸爸。”
导师也喝了不少，没和我计较。
所以晕晕乎乎的我转向了他一旁安静吃菜的儿子：“明奕。”
对方诧异地转过头挑了挑眉。
“得空多替我谢谢咱爸。”
此话一出，四座皆惊。
只有当事人仍然淡定，轻轻一笑，微点了点头。
然后，我一时忘形，俯下身捧着他的脸吻了上去。
第二天早上，头脑仍有些昏昏沉沉的我打开微信，看到置顶消息顿时清醒：
“唐倩，解释一下昨天晚上跟我儿子的事情。”
我心凉了。
老师，我说我馋他很久了，会被您开除吗？
2.
在这次社死之前，我发誓，我原本的形象一直都是内向文静的。
直到遇到明奕才破了功。
一年前那场沉闷尴尬的破冰宴，在他到来的一刻全然变了景象。
“各位别客气，全部由明教授买单。”
我原本正扮隐形人，手里却莫名被塞了一份菜单。
“学妹喜欢吃什么啊？这个虾怎么样？”这个剑眉星目的浓颜帅哥自来熟得仿佛小区相亲角的大妈。
“都，都行。”
我向来都不擅长跟陌生人交际，瞬间红了脸。
他自问自答着在我身边落座，又去招呼其他人，靠着无比强大的社交技能带动了全场的氛围。
后来，我们甚至互相敬起了酒。
3.
饭后玩真心话大冒险时，我比先前放松了不少，但抽中“亲在场任意异性一口”还是原地石化。
周围人看到我瞬间面色又变得通红，愈发来了劲，起哄催我抓紧。
“我豁出去了。”明奕伸手点了点我肩膀，微微一笑，“我不跟你们导师，多半见不到，不怕尴尬。”
“快快快亲一个！”
于是，我眼睛一闭，横下心，嘴唇在他脸颊一侧轻轻一印。
接近他的那一刻，鼻端被一阵似有似无的薄荷香气萦绕。只是短短的一瞬，却好像在分开…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在使用飞书以前，我是如何网络授课的
2020年一月，一场疫情将人类社会冻结。工作冻结、生活冻结。人们被关在家里没法出门，也不能参与到工作当中。也正是因为这样，催生出了「远程办公」这样的模式，让一直不被大家重视的「协同办公」走到了历史的舞台最前方，展现出了不一样的魅力。
传统的协同办公，自然要提到 Google Workspace 这个远程协同办公的老大哥。在日本的公司里，经常需要讨论教案或者上课的一些新方法，有些时候需要整理成文档。公司有订阅 Workspace ，所以我们都在其上面讨论或者通过文档来交流对于教案的看法。
同样因为疫情受到影响的，还有我们上课的流程。以往都是线下面授课，疫情期间全部改为用 Zoom 给学生上网课，这个时候就涉及到了板书问题。线下可以写在白板上，线上怎么办呢？在使用飞书以前，我的解决办法是用 iPad 加入会议，然后再用 iPad 来共享屏幕进行板书。这样确实很方便，却也存在一个不可调和的问题——画面同步差到极致。往往一个流畅的书写过程被卡顿的屏幕共享硬生生切成了三个分解动作；往后流畅地翻页被其分解成了 PPT 没有过度特效的翻页。
总之，一切的一切，都迫使我停止使用 iPad 来作为板书工具，并且急需一个替代品。这个代替品既能起到「板书」的作用，同时还能兼顾 PDF 阅读器的职能。最好还能在 PDF 文件上做标记。
开始尝试使用飞书
需求有了，接下来就是对比市面上的产品了。学生年龄在初中阶段，用 Coda 或者 Worspace 不太合适，他们可能并没有太多精力去研究这两个东西到底怎么用；用 Notion 的话导入 PDF 又非常不便； iPad 更是不再考虑，它最多只能作为一个辅助性的工具。
找到飞书是个巧合，完全是在研究工作流的时候碰到了飞书，并且被这个远程办公的模式启发，觉得可以用在我的课堂上。说干就干，于是我从本地将我目前保留的教案全…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1.1.1.  什么是点击防抖？
  在应用日常使用过程中，短时间内超过一次点击某个按钮会触发多次这个按钮的后续逻辑代码运行，这时加入某些手段屏蔽掉除第一次以外的点击事件去重复触发逻辑的控制称为点击防抖。
1.1.2.  为什么需要添加点击防抖?
  正如上面介绍的，在没有添加点击防抖的情况下短时间内多次点击某按钮会多次触发相关逻辑，比如多次打开某个页面，多次提交某些网络请求等等，这些通常不是我们所期望的，而且有些逻辑多次触发也有可能引起程序卡顿、数据异常、应用崩溃等问题。
  综上所述，我们在某些场景下是需要添加点击防抖的，以此来进行限制用户有意或无意的短时间内频繁点击按钮的操作，来规避由此产生的期望外的运行结果。
1.1.3.  点击防抖的间隔
  点击防抖的间隔是否越长越好呢？当然不是，过长的点击防抖间隔会给用户造成按钮点击无效的感觉，通常点击防抖的间隔不宜大于500ms。
  点击防抖的间隔是否越短越好呢？当然也不是，间隔过短，点击防抖也就失去了意义，点击防抖本身的意义就是通过屏蔽短时间的连续点击来规避异常逻辑，如果点击防抖间隔过短，那这个设置本身就失去了他自身的意义。通常点击防抖的间隔应大于100ms。
  综上所述，通常情况下点击防抖间隔应取100ms到500ms之间，但是这个值并非固定值，需要根据实际的业务场景进行调整，一般原则是和你的点击事件处理逻辑时间成正比，逻辑处理时间越长，则点击间隔应该越长，逻辑处理时间越短，则点击间隔应该尽量短。比如点击逻辑是打开页面，这个逻辑只有100ms，则点击间隔应该尽量短，比如点击逻辑是打开蓝牙，这个逻辑有800ms，则点击间隔就需要适量增加。

1.1.4.  是否所有点击都需要点击防抖？
  并不是，通常我们需要添加点击防抖都是根据实际业务去填加，并不建议所有按钮都统一添加，这是因为有很多按钮都是实时操作的，如果添加了点…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java内存模型 & JVM内存分区
线程之间的通信
在命令式编程中，线程之间的通信机制有两种共享内存和消息传递。
共享内存：线程之间通过写-读内存中的公共状态来隐式进行通信，典型的共享内存通信方式就是通过共享对象进行通信。
消息传递：线程之间没有公共状态，线程之间必须通过明确的发送消息来显式进行通信，在java中典型的消息传递方式就是wait()和notify()，notifyAll()。
Java内存模型
Java的并发采用的是共享内存模型，JMM决定一个线程对共享变量的写入何时对另一个线程可见。
JMM(Java Memory Model)是Java虚拟机规范定义的，用来屏蔽掉Java程序在各种不同的硬件和操作系统对内存的访问的差异。
Java虚拟机规范中试图定义一种Java内存模型来屏蔽掉各种硬件和操作系统的内存访问差异。
---《深入理解Java虚拟机》

这组规则是控制程序中各个变量在共享数据区域和私有数据区域的访问方式，围绕原子性，有序性、可见性展开；Java内存模型中规定所有变量都存储在主内存， 主内存是共享内存区域，所有线程都可以访问，但线程对变量的操作(读取赋值等)必须在工作内存中进行;
线程之间的共享变量存储在主内存（main memory）中，每个线程都有一个私有的本地内存（local memory），本地内存中存储了该线程以读/写共享变量的副本。本地内存是JMM的一个抽象概念，并不真实存在。它涵盖了缓存，写缓冲区，寄存器以及其他的硬件和编译器优化。
如何从工作内存同步到主内存之间的实现细节，Java内存模型定义了以下八种操作来完成,而且这8个操作必须是原子性的。
数据同步八大原子操作
lock（锁定）：作用于主内存的变量，把一个变量标识为一条线程独占状态。
unlock（解锁）：作用于主内存变量，把一个处于锁定状态的变量释放出来，释放后的变量才可以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。
 
其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。


Part 1|咨询前
 确认专业资质和能力 

1. 教育经历
 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。
比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。
而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。



国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：

精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；
临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；
学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；
私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。

在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。
2.执业资格
除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。
2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。

我之前在 Newsletter 里分享了用 Craft X Snippets 记录晨间日记的方法，评论区收到一个关于 Daily Notes 如何归档整理的小问题，回复中也思考了一番 Craft 这个应用本身。作为我在过去的一年中最喜爱、又带给我很大帮助的应用，想在新年伊始为它当一回「传教者」，在此展开讲讲，它有哪些特别之处，我为何喜欢它，以及一些使用上的研究和小技巧；当然，也会有它的不足。

Craft 是去年 Apple 评选的 Mac App of the Year，也获得了 Apple Design Award「交互」赛道提名，足以说明它一定有值得称道之处。少数派在 App Store Awards 2021 这篇文章中说它是：

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

是的，Craft 在 2020 年 11 月正式上线，到今天也就差不多一年的工夫。团队的精心打磨，使得它一上线就有着非常高的完成度。而过去一年中又陆续发布了 21 个大更新和 26 个小更新，也就是说，几乎每 2-2.5 周就会有一个大更新。我是从 iOS App Store 推荐知道它的，抱着试一试的态度，拿到手就被教学关近乎完美的动效吸引。在花了一点点时间探索，并看了帮助文档后，知道了很多令人心动的小细节，不免对这个应用心生好感，随即陆续把自己的笔记都搬了过来。
在使用 Craft 的一年里，时不时收到官方发来的「我们又更新了」的邮件，带来许多令人欣喜的 feature（很多时候刚好在想「要是有 xx 功能就好了」，结果真的更新了），并且他们的 更新说明 写得非常漂亮，读起来是一种享受，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[众所周知，MOBA游戏网络效应好、社区属性强，自然增长极快。然而其初期推广难、用户累积慢、运营成本高等问题又总是令让众多厂商纷纷折戟。到今天，纵观市场，似乎只有《王者荣耀》和《无尽对决》曾杀出重围，获得人气与价值的双丰收。其他产品却没有这样好的运气了，不管是网易的《决战！平安京》，还是腾讯的《Arena of Valor》，纵使承载着极高期望和投入，却都没能够翻起太大水花，最终也不过是淹没于茫茫游戏之海，被众人所遗忘。

2020年6月，腾讯和Pokemon Company共同宣布联手打造基于宝可梦IP的轻度MOBA手游《宝可梦大集结》，欲二度冲击海外市场。游戏于2021年7月登录Switch平台，同年9月登录移动端平台。令人惊讶的是，本作并没有照搬腾讯天美信手拈来的Dota式核心战斗模式，而是迎合轻度玩家喜好，从诸如《风暴英雄》和《Splatoon 2》的类MOBA游戏中汲取灵感，将游戏的重心，从杀敌推塔，转移到了收集能量、达阵得分上，让MOBA游戏走上了休闲娱乐的全新道路。腾讯希望依赖宝可梦的全球影响力来吸引到IP粉丝/泛用户，逐步扩圈，培养出更大的欧美MOBA玩家市场。那么，此番采用全新玩法与独特画风、针对不同目标用户群的《宝可梦大集结》，有没有帮助腾讯再下一城呢？

从数据来看，上线三个月的《宝可梦大集结》在海外市场的表现可谓是高开低走。在声势浩大的首周发布后，游戏逐步暴露出新用户获取乏力、现有用户流失多、长期付费不如意等问题。这究竟是什么原因呢？本期《庖丁解游》就将为大家解析一下这款游戏：《宝可梦大集结》。


（一）游戏循环：单局对战贯穿始终

《宝可梦大集结》游戏核心循环示意如图，MOBA类游戏的核心循环简单明了，主要以单局对战为基础，在对战—变强—继续对战的链条上衍生诸多其他机制。对《宝可梦大集结》来说，在对战之外，玩家还可以在对战中累计胜场、获得金币，从而…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[跨保读研半年，周围人对我的评价多围绕：理智有计划，做事有条理。但深入追踪我的决策与执行会发现，相比于一个模糊的目标，一个清晰地有符合科学依据的计划更不容易被我执行。
换句话说，我有能力制定一个完美的计划，但产生之后，我不愿意去执行它。
这就很难搞。
然后我发现我会倾向于先有一个清晰的终点目标，然后将实现路径模糊化，保持大方向是对的，剩下就随机碰撞，这样的计划很不完美，很不符合SMART原则和OKP法则，但对我很有效。
同时又产生了另一个问题，实现路径的模糊化很容易带来得过且过、自欺欺人和自我感动，于是又想出了另一个办法，在执行时忠实地记录。
所以记录下这个红黑榜，更多的是面对真实的我，没有自负，也不自我贬低。
完美的对立面不是不完美，而是真实。
  红榜  



01

看了一些书，并且开始有深度


也犯过急于求成的毛病啊，想标榜自己一年看完很多很多书，再不济也可以做到一周一本。
但我很快发现这样看书很容易让数量掩盖另一些可能性：比如深度，比如多线并开式读书（我看书看累了会换一本书看，但想到一周的时间不够了就会犹豫）。
后来在B站上看【哈佛john】的视频时发现一周一本书还会让自己在选择书籍时倾向于选择一周能读完的书，觉得分析得很透彻，然后就放弃掉追求数量的想法。
还会在自己看书特别快的时候敲一下自己的脑壳，慢下来，贪多嚼不烂。
这样下来我实际看完的书反而比原定计划要多，有些一气呵成的小说（比如《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》）读起来也一气呵成，有些可以碎片化阅读的文字（比如《戴老师的魔性诗词课》）也没花什么专门的功夫就读完了。或许这就是无痛阅读？

02

不动笔墨不读书


 
这是很早以前就从书中汲取到的知识，今年终于逐渐形成了习惯。
一方面是因为希望通过记录想法让读书的节奏慢下来，另一方面是隔一段时间再看由某本书引发的思考，觉得“哇，这么厉害的话居然…]]></summary>

但也有部分车企比较叛逆，要么是另辟蹊径，要么是划水躺平，反正就是读不懂用户的心。
所以，接下三斤哥就为大家总结下我眼中2021年上市车型中最好和最差的几款，暨第二届“金轱辘奖”年度车型评选颁奖典礼。
写在最前（评选原则）

本次评选纯主观，如有不同意见纯属正常；
所有候选车型均为2021年新上市正式交付用户的车型；
上述新上市不含年度改款或变化幅度较小的中期改款；
候选车型尽可能从较为常见的品牌中选取；
……

第二届“金轱辘奖”最佳车型
纯电组——极氪001

获奖理由：如果你想买一台BBA，那你真的可以来看一看极氪001
其实极氪001自从上市以来就收获了很多关注，并且随着时间的推移，还得到了各种各样的吐槽，一度有不少人觉得极氪001是个非常大的坑。
但是让我们回归理性，极氪001这台车是不是真的像网友说得那么神 or 那么坑？
那么在我看来，如果只进行简单的选配的话，WE版的性价比其实还是非常非常高的。
即使是现在订车，WE版乞丐版扣除补贴后的售价应该是在28万左右，那么28万你可以得到什么？

一个我个人认为还不错的外观、无框车门、电动尾门；
媲美C级车的内部空间、可调节的后排座椅；
Model 3P级别的加速 or 蔚来标价12.8万的100度电池；
越级的内饰用料；
比传统豪华品牌更智能的车机和辅助驾驶系统；
……

以上这一切的落地价都没有超过30万，而30万落地的BBA又有什么呢？
插电混动组——比亚迪 秦DM-i

获奖理由：秦plus DM-i的上市让一切关于混动车是否更划算的争吵失去了意义
如果有人穿越到2021年初告诉你，今年有一款均价10万+的自主品牌A级轿车可以连续几个月进入轿车销量榜前十，你会相信吗？
可能大多数人都不会相信，但是秦plus做到…]]></summary>

凭借 ZZT 的成功，Epic MegaGames 正式成立。在命名新公司时，Tim 认为玩家的第一印象很重要，公司名字听起来像是“大”公司，这样才产生信任，而且要够酷够“狠” (badass)，最后把 Epic (史诗) 和 Mega (大) 组合起来，就有了 Epic MegaGames 的名字。
尽管 ZZT 销售情况很不错，但 Epic MegaGames 还只是 Tim 一个人的公司。Tim 需要开始下一款产品的开发和销售，产生收入。他看到 id Software 的指挥官基恩 (Commander Keen) 后大受启发。指挥官基恩是 John Carmack 受任天堂超级马里奥启发后开发，在 1990 年推出的一款 2D 横版卷轴过关游戏。指挥官基恩流畅的动作和画面给 Tim 带来了深刻印象，认为他下一款游戏需要突破 ZZT 这样的简单风格。Tim 找来了两位美术和一位作曲，开发了一款游戏机制和指挥官基恩相似的游戏 Jill of the Jungle，由玩家操纵女性角色 Jill 在森林中冒险闯关。Jill of the Jungle 的销量对比 ZZT 也上了一个新台阶，在发售初期每天能卖出 20 到 30 份。
  
Jill of the Jungle 游戏画面

除了自己继续进行游戏开发以外，Tim 也在考虑扩张团队。Mark Rein 会逢其适地出现了。Mark Rein 是一位狂热玩家，在 1990 年体验过指挥官基恩之后，他联系上了 id Software 创始人之一 John Romero 表达了自己对这个系列的喜爱。John Romero 也因此邀请他测试还在开发中的指挥官基恩 4。经过近距离交流，John Romero 认为 Mark Rein 具备 id 所代表的“黑客精神” (hacker mentality)…]]></summary>

笔者实在没有半夜赶稿子的能耐，毕竟是一条社畜。一早起来就看到 @呆呆兽星君 的文章，细读之后，叹为观止。既然珠玉在前，笔者也就谈一下本次更新中另一位出手的女性——陆玲珑，以及她所依凭的全真功法，是如何给她自信上岛一闯的？

玲珑师承：大道至简  独全其真
陆玲珑所修习的是被金庸誉为”玄门正宗“的全真派功夫。

全真派源流
全真一脉是道家现存最大的两大流派之一（另一个就是正一派），由金代王重阳(公元1112年—1170年)创立，主张儒、佛、道三教合一，即以“三教圆融、识心见性、独全其真”为宗旨，相比正一派的祖师张道陵（公元34年－156年）晚了千年的时光。但是其开创的全真道流派却能够在千年之后与正一道分庭抗礼，其主旨所推推崇“以无为为主”，即注重个人修炼，相比入世甚深的正一派，则是回归老庄清静无为的思想。

白云观——全真三大祖庭之一
虽然相比正一派的入世风格，全真派恪守戒律，对于世事不会多做介入，但全真派始终坚持“贵生”的理念。陆玲珑师承全真龙门派，其拜师的北京白云观正是全真教三大祖庭之一。当年丘处机赴雪山应成吉思汗聘，成吉思汗问他如何治理天下，他回答应以“敬天爱民”为本；问长生久视之道，回答以清心寡欲为要。后回京居太极宫，元太祖因其道号长春子，诏改太极宫为长春宫。及丘处机羽化，弟子尹志平等在长春宫东侧营建下院，即今白云观，并于观中构筑处顺堂，安厝丘处遗蜕。

成吉思皇帝敕真人丘师：省所奏应诏而来者，备悉。惟师：道踰三子，德重多端。命臣奉厥元纁，驰传访诸沧海。时与愿适，天不人远。两朝屡诏而不行，单使一邀而肯起。谓朕天启，所以身归。不辞暴露于风霜，自愿跋涉于沙碛。书章来上，喜慰何言？军国之事，非朕所期；道德之心，诚云可尚。朕以彼酋不逊，我伐用张。军旅临试，边陲底定。来从去背，实力率之故然；久逸暂劳，冀心服而后已。是用载扬威德，略驻车徒。重念云轩既发于蓬莱，鹤驭可游于…]]></summary>

我其实没有使用智能手表的需求，原来佩戴的西铁城五局电波表已经非常好用了：不需要充电、不需要手动校时，搭配定制表带当作装饰品也非常好看。
原装钢表带与定制牛皮表带
所以这是一次「深思熟虑」过的冲动消费，一方面是需要用消费让自己更快乐一些，另一方面也是希望补完三星全家桶，体验「Galaxy Ecosystem」到底能不能打。当然，Galaxy Watch4 一定要有让我眼前一亮的特性或功能，我才会像「陨石打到头」那般点击付款，其中就包括全新 Wear OS 以及发布会上看似非常厉害的「身体成分检测」功能。
现在这块手表在我手上使用也有两个月时间了，下面就来说说 Galaxy Watch4（以下简称 Watch4）给我带来了什么。
智能手表终究是一块表
相比传统手表，智能手表已然属于电子数码产品的范畴，但其本质还是一块表。手表就要守「表德」：颜值姣好、佩戴舒适、查看方便。Watch4 作为手表算是合格。
我手上这一块是 Watch4 44mm 幽谷绿版本，视觉上更偏向军绿色。三星产品虽然没有 Apple Watch 那般配件丰富，不过好在它采用了快拆表带，能够支持不少通用配件。直径 44mm 对我个人来说还是有点秀气了，Classic 46mm 版本倒是非常符合我的审美，但它除了配备物理旋转表圈以外，无论是性能还是续航都没有什么优势。唯一一点让我不满意的是，三星自家手机都属于窄边框领头羊，Watch4 又有何理由还在让边框停航母呢？
光照好的情况下会呈现军绿色
第一眼看上去，Watch4 非常薄，不过这只是在视觉讨巧罢了，三星利用表身最…]]></summary>
