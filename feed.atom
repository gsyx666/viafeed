        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While a lot of programming languages that have a "nullish" type (null, nil, etc.) debate about avoiding it, JavaScript is the only popular one that has two, you read that right, two nullish types. One of the most common recommendations is to stick to using only one, and my recommendation is to only use undefined and avoid null. In this article, we will go over the reasons you might also want to avoid null in JavaScript and TypeScript.
As Douglas Crockford put it in one of his talks, JavaScript itself uses undefined all the time, so let's use the one the language uses:
let something; // This is undefined!

const otherThing = {
    foo: "hi",
};
otherThing.bar; // This is also undefined

const aFunction = anArgument => {
    // anArgument here is undefined if no value is passed
};

En este artículo exploraremos a fondo las características de los JSON Web Tokens, su composición y su implementación utilizando Minimal APIs y ASP.NET Identity.
El código de ejemplo lo podrás encontrar en este repositorio en mi github. Espero les sea de utilidad.
Un JSON Web Token (JWT) es un estándar (RFC 7519) que define una forma segura y compacta de transmitir información entre dos entidades en forma de un objeto JSON.
Esta información puede ser verificada y es confiable ya que está firmada digitalmente. Los JWTs pueden ser firmados utilizando una llave privada (con un algoritmo HMAC) o con llaves públicas y privadas utilizando RSA o ECDSA.
Aquí veremos un par de escenarios donde es útil y recomendable utilizar los JWTs:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you develop with IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, GoLand, or other JetBrains IDEs,  it’s likely you’ve waited for “indexing” to complete after opening a project. While this may be annoying, it’s necessary for IntelliJ and other heavy-weight IDEs to have features such as code search, highlighting, refactoring, and code completion.
Waiting for an IDE to finish indexing a project might not be a big problem for many workflows. After the first load, indexes are cached and subsequent runs are faster. However, indexing time can be a huge blocker for developers, especially in these cases:
large projects (monorepos, many dependencies, monolithic applications)


running old/slow machines (indexing is CPU-intensive)


ephemeral developer workspaces (containers, remote IDEs)

Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open-source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. It’s usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. Some well-known open-source projects include Django, Postgres, MongoDB, Vue, Go, Ruby, TypeScript, Git and so many more.
There is a variety of good reasons to release something under an open-source license, from “more perspectives make better software” to “establishing a standard.” It is important to build a sustainable project to consider your reasons for publish…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on eaf-linter for about a few days now, and it already has 6 stars and 2 forks. My other project that I've been working on, the Backend Server, has 14 stars, 9 forks, and nearly 10 outside contributors. That might not sound like a lot, but both of these projects are only about a week old.
So, how did I do it?
The most important thing has been issues, which I talked about here. But, the second most important thing has been designing a great readme. 
A good readme is the difference between someone staring your project and someone ignoring it. If you have badges, easily understandable features, and lots of images, you have a star worthy repository. 
First, you need to have badges. If you don't know what a badge is, it's the little image that says how many stars, downloads, etc. a project has. These are also known as shields, and you can get them from this website. If you have a ton of them and they all say good things, it increases the confidence that someone has in your project. 
Secondly, you need easily understandable features. If you look at my newest repository, eaf-linter, you will see that all of the features have a simple headline and they link to a new page. This is very important. If your feature can link to a more in depth description of the feature, it will increase the confidence that the possible contributor has in your project. 
Finally, images are super important. In my backend server, I have a ton of really eye-catching images. These images increase the likelihood that someone will keep looking through your readme, and the longer that the person stays on your page, the more likely they are to star your repository. 
There will be more tips like this coming tomorrow and the day after, so if you liked hearing this, make sure to follow me, so you can see more tips as they come out.
Also, our open-source, non-profit is hiring right now if you're interested. Don't forget to follow us on LinkedIn.]]></summary>

There is a timeout on connections to an AWS s3 instance set to 120000ms (2 minutes). Unless you have very small files, this just won't cut it for streaming. 
One option is to simply raise that timeout, but then how much should you raise it? Since the timeout is for the total time a connection can last; you would have to either make the timeout some ridiculous amount, or guess how long it will take to stream the file and update the timeout accordingly. This is also not taking into account the stream closing due to HTTP(S)'s own timeout reasons as well.
Instead of making guesses and fighting random bugs, we can make use of the NodeJS Stream AP…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously, I talked about how to create easily an Entity (ex:JOB) using a simple command line make:Entity and answering a few question(fields,type…).
This article will be about saving data to, fetching data from, the database.
To do so, we need to use a service provided by Doctrine, called EntityManagerInterface. The command  symfony console  debug:autowiring doctrine shows all doctrine services available.
Type-hint an argument $em to EntityManagerInterface, create an Object (ex $job), set all its properties then call persist and flush methods.

Calling persist() method tells Doctrine that we want to save the object, no query is executed yet. We call this method as many time as objects that we have, once we call flush() method, Doctrine execute the queries needed to insert to database.
We can check if data has been inserted with : symfony console doctrine:query:sql 'select * from job'

Getting data(objects) from db is even easier, one way to do that is by using JobRepository $jobRepo as an argument in our method. 

The repository class offers many helper methods to get our data from db like : findBy, findOneBy... We can also add custom methods to have complex queries, more about that in my next article. 
Finally, I like to mention that Profiler provides a lot of tools to use when developing an app, for doctrine, it shows all queries executed :

Por exemplo, caso tenhamos um objeto como o a seguir:

Podemos fazer a desestruturação com a seguinte sintaxe:
const { name, age } = user;

console.log(name); // Eduardo

console.log(age); // 39

Porém se as variáveis name e age já tiverem sido declaradas no mesmo escopo, será necessário desestruturar e renomear ao mesmo tempo:
const { name: newName, age: newAge } = user;

console.log(newName); // Eduardo

console.log(newAge); // 39

Para atribuir a desestruturação para as variáveis declaradas anteriormente, utiliza-se a seguinte sintaxe (parênteses na declaração):

  age = 22;

({ name, age } = user);

This is a great experience to me and to be honest, I also learnt a lot while giving mentorship. So today, I'd like to share some of my ideas about mentoring junior software engineers.
I would admit that, at start, I was quite happy that I could mentor 3 interns at the same time. It was my first official experience practicing mentorship at work, so I was very happy that my capability was recognised by my superior. However, I found that I was too naive. More mentees means greater responsibilities and I would need to spare more time from my work to provide mentorship. 
Why do I have to spend much time to mentee? Why not just assign the …]]></summary>

Recently I felt like I wanted to branch out and learn something new. I've always been interested in the practical and creative side of programming, so being able to deploy a project that is public facing was an exciting departure from the myriad of bespoke and educational Python scripts I've written.
Django was exciting to me for a few reasons: 
Popular and Scalable (Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox)
Excellent Documentation
Embraces Test Based Development 
I started my journey by cozying up with the official Django tutorial which teaches you how to write a simple poll app. This was a good intro, and opened my eyes to the simplicity and beauty of writing unit tests in Django. However, I wanted something a bit friendlier – something in-between a drawn out 4 hour monetised Youtube video,…]]></summary>

@甜約翰：机智医生生活 第二季

作品信息：2021-06 / 韩国 / 剧集 / 剧情 / 90 分钟 × 12 集 / 豆瓣链接
获奖理由：时隔一年，《机智医生生活》第二季如约而至。本季延续了第一季的剧情，继续讲述律帝医院里，医生、护士、患者们之间平凡琐碎却又温暖人心的故事。吵吵闹闹的「99s」全员回归 —— 搞笑担当李翼俊、理想主义安正元、冷面毒舌金俊完、十级社恐杨硕亨，以及机医五人组的精神支柱、「灵魂歌者」蔡颂华，剧集保持了「机智的请回答宇宙」一以贯之的高品质，是念念不忘又恋恋不舍的个人年度最佳。
不同于传统的医疗职业剧，《机智医生生活》第二季延续了「请回答」系列和「机智」系列的风格 —— 聚焦人、描绘人、挖掘人。本剧以非常规的叙述视角，精准的细节刻画，出人意料的各式反转，性格鲜明的人物群像，以及演员亲自演唱的 OST，把友情、爱情、人情写进了被称为「人生缩影」的医院里，并且较好地平衡了现实主义的无奈与理想主义的浪漫。

在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。
和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。

自我介绍环节
大家好，我是赵赛坡，我把自己定位为一名内容生产者。
过去十年的时间里，我做过记者、参与过公众号的内容创业。2017 年之后，我开始专注使用邮件通讯（Newsletter）的形式，系统输出我的发现与思考。
我所创建的「Dailyio」是一份由读者付费支持的邮件通讯（Newsletter）产品，每周通过两到三封风格不同、主题迥异的邮件通讯（Newsletter），探讨新时代里的人机关系：

「iPad Power User」聚焦如何使用机器。以 iPad 为平台，关注使用数字工具（机器）及其背后的方法与逻辑；
「AI Insider」以人工智能发展为切入口，记录新技术和技术新趋势带给各行各业的机遇与挑战；
「Deep Reading」以反碎片化阅读的形式，推荐一系列聚焦机器如何定义社会的长文与图书。

撰写了那么多期 Newsletter 以后，你对这种内容形式有什么看法吗？
首先，邮件通讯（Newsletter） 并不是新鲜产品，即便是基于互联网的 邮件通讯（Newsletter） 的历史也非常古老。
其次，最近两年邮件通讯（Newsletter） 的火热，其实是建立在这样一个背景之下：强大的社交媒体（比如 FB）与算法分发（比如 FB 和今日头条）平台，改变了内容链条上的创作者与消费者的关系。

Podcast version:

Hashicorp Vault is an opensource software from Hashicorp. Vault is used to manage secrets. 
Secrets can be considered as anything that one uses to authenticate, authorize themselves. Secrets are also pieces of information that are private to any user. 
Examples of secrets:
Username, password
API Tokens
Database credentials
TLS certificates
Credit card information
Applications use a lot of credentials to connect to various external services like databases, message brokers & cloud services. These credentials tend to stay in the config files, source code, version control systems like Github, log files, and plain text files. This form of exposing the secrets and making them vulnerable to unintended access is known as 'state of secret sprawl'. Vault tries to solve this problem.

1. Centralization of secrets:
2. Access control via ACLS:
3. Audits:
4. Encryption of secrets:
5. Dynamic secrets:
6. Encryption as a service
7. High availability:
In the upcoming episodes, we will look into 
The setup of Vault

Software engineers usually struggle with system design interviews partly due to their lack of experience developing large-scale systems and partly due to the unstructured nature of system design interviews. Even advanced and experienced developers find system design interviews challenging since the design questions are open-ended and have no standard answer. To help with that, in my previous post, we discussed a step-by-step approach for solving system design interview questions. Let’s follow that approach to solve a classical system design question: Designing a URL shortening service like TinyURL.
Question Statement: Let’s design a URL shortening service like TinyURL. This service will provide short aliases redirecting to long URLs.

Having spent 40 years in the software industry -- as a documentor, developer, and test automator -- I can't see that any of the work I did, however relevant at the time, survives:  Nothing beside remains.
Well, it's now almost five years since I got retired.  For the first three of those, I worked on projects of my own, blogged, posted here, and contributed some to Ruby's spec project.  As for the posts to my blog and posts here, it's amazing how quickly the search engines learn to ignore your posts and cast them into the darkness-- think red shift.
Then in September 2019 I came to my senses, and started doing something that will last: contributing enhanced RDoc for the Ruby project itself.
So far, in the Ruby documentation I've:
Added "What's Here" sections for about 20 classes and modules.
Re-written the introductory material for about 15 classes and modules.
Re-written entirely the methods documentation for about 15 classes.
Added separate documents for bsearch, dig, and implicit conversion.
From time to time I'll post here, linking to some of these changes.
Happy new year!]]></summary>

everyone knows that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. In other words, JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.
The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. JavaScript creates the execution contexts and pushes and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution process.
If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function’s execution because the page hangs.
A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions of the webpage, such as mouse click.

Let's take a dive into the history of AI, and check Prolog - the language at the center of those AI attempts, and while it's not any in-depth analysis, we'll bump into a few reasons why it all failed.
Prolog does logic programming, but it also has some basic ability to do regular programming like I/O and so on. Many Prologs also have builtin constraint solver libraries similar to Z3. I'll stay away from those parts and mostly focus on the core Prolog.

I can either build the system to detect the duplications based on plain text. This is how most systems work because it is the simpler of the two options. But, it is also the most failure prone. For instance, this system would fail if there was the same exact code in two places, but there was a comment in the middle of one of them- it would not register as a duplicate.  
Alternatively, I can use an abstract syntax tree to detect the duplications. But, theres another problem there- what is the most-lightweight and all-around-best javascript parser out there? I'm planning on using the babel parser but I'm already running into a problem because it doesn't parse the comments in a way I would like. 
So, if you have an opinion on what I should do, please leave a comment below. Also, please star the project and contribute if you have time. If you can, that would be amazing, and I thank you so much!]]></summary>

在使用 iPad mini 6 的这一个多月时间里，我发现我又重新拥有了平板电脑。
是的，我太久没有使用过「平板电脑」了，这几年我一直都在使用 iPad Pro 12.9 搭配妙控键盘，它几乎一年 365 天没有离开键盘的时刻，我早已习惯地把 iPad Pro 当成一台触屏电脑使用，而不是可以捧在手中的平板。
iPad mini 6 在我眼里就像是久而未见的老朋友，陌生却又熟悉，让我找回了平板最初的形态，很好地融入了生活。

一.让我们聊聊尺寸
这台小设备有许多可以聊的地方，我想先从「小」这个话题开始讲起，
尺寸是一切
iPad mini 6 的核心在于尺寸，8.3 吋是无压力手持的黄金尺寸。
很多人形容 iPad mini 6 是一个「便携」设备，我觉得这个形容词不够准确。如果我每天都背双肩包上班，那我觉得 12.9 吋的 iPad Pro 很便携；如果我每天只背小挎包出街，那 iPad mini 6 称得上便携。如果我想每天无负担出门，那只有手机还算便携。所以你看，每个人的通勤场景都不一样，对于便携的理解是不一致的。

我的定义是：这一个非常适合手持的阅读设备。无论是两只手捧着，还是单手举着，我都能找回以前看小开本书籍的感觉。
我可以在通勤时拿起它看书，可以在如厕时捧着它消遣，也可以在睡觉前回顾信息。大尺寸 iPad 并不适合在这些场景下使用。

只要我出门带包的情况下，我都会背着 iPad mini 6，因为我总能在包里找一个合适的位置放置它。一定程度上，携带一台 iPad mini 6 并不会给我带来太大负担，这也是 iP…]]></summary>

My goal was to write code solutions in Haskell and JavaScript with more or less equivalent implementations. I have been learning functional programming academically for five or six years, so Advent of Code gave me an opportunity to practice what I have been learning. Unfortunately, things didn't go exactly as planned, so here are some of the lessons I learned:
Don't rush learning
Just start somewhere
Functional programming has different flavors
Functional programming in JavaScript is meh
Use the strengths of the language



The first two days of Advent of Code went according to plan. I came up with relatively concise solutions in Haskell that translated to idiomatic JavaScript, then wrote blog posts summarizing my approach. Day th…]]></summary>

This is one simpler issue, but the simplest bug can be the biggest at times, so I made sure I document it and can help anyone out there too.
In my react project's root I have a GitLab-ci.yml file that automatically runs whenever I push a commit to the server. It triggers a notification to the runner I specified, and then it processes the series of tasks I specified.
Which involves building and deploying.
This is a legacy React project, and had long been updated. After upgrading the packages I git committed. Build built successfully but deployment failed. With the following error:

I read through the error to understand what the problem really was, and I found it:
Module.createRequire is not a function

That was the only error that was reasonably clear indeed and meant something.
So I Googled it, and I found out that it's an issue with Create React App, it's always on or looking for the latest, which means the Node engine version has to always be the latest and that includes my npm version, else some things might break.
So in essence whatever machine running that project has to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6
My GitLab-ci.yml contains a Docker image with a node version of 10.15.3, so there is a need to upgrade.




image: giona69/node-10.15.3-aws-eb

And I temporarily replaced the docker image with the latest node.




image: node:14.18.2

Rebuilt Node-Sass
I added 
npm rebuild node-sass 
And Voila!! That fixed the issue. These weeks has been simple, this is the issues I have been experiencing.
My name is Anayo Oleru, I specialise in Backend Development(NodeJS & ExpressJS), but I am experienced with Web frontend(ReactJS) and mobile(React-native). And I am open to offers in these fields.
You can follow me on Twitter at @anayooleru or send an email to: anayo_oleru@outlook.com

So the first question that can strike you is why we need a custom directive when Angular already provided us with 6 amazing directives. The simple reason is there can be multiple scenarios where the exact requirements are not met using the built-in directives. In those cases we need to write our own logic to meet the requirement and custom directives comes to the rescue.
Now, lets see how we can create our own custom directive.

[电影] 爱情神话

关键词：剧情 / 喜剧 / 爱情
片长：112 分钟；豆瓣链接

这就是成年人的爱情啊！

@宇宙浪费指南：《爱情神话》可以说毁誉参半，也可以说叫好不叫座，看电影前我也比较忐忑，鼎鼎大名的「爱在三部曲」我欣赏不来，同类型的片也难有让我惊叹的，不过，这部电影倒是有些超出预期。
这不是一部传统的电影类型片，很多地方它反常规，更多地方也不遵循套路，这里没有两女争一男的俗套戏码，也没有描述中年离异男女生活里的鸡飞狗跳，或许电影的故事发生地设定在上海，沪语的氛围加上上海的格调，才能把文艺中年的爱情拍得有格调但也接地气吧。
很多人用「灵啊」来形容这部电影，不光因为这是一句上海话，也是对导演灵气的夸赞。作为一个外地人，她把上海的精致、文艺和包容力展现得…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[搬家到一个陌生的城市，往往意味着对周边一无所知。不仅如此，连社会关系都需要重新构建。在完全适应新生活、找到新的朋友圈之前，如果想要一个人探索新城市，有哪些地方可以去呢？
希望这篇文章可以为你提供一些「新城市中可去之处」的灵感，去哪里、怎么探索，以及如何在新城市迅速找到感兴趣的目的地。
探索的边界
在列出一些可能的目的地之前，可能需要思考一下，你能去到最远的地方是哪里？不同的城市规模也不同，根据偏好的出行方式，即使是同样的出行时间也能去到不同距离的地方。
如果喜欢步行，就可以先从周边的社区开始探索；如果不讨厌公共交通，那隔壁区甚至全市的景点都能去到；可以开车的话，能去的地方就更多了——时间充裕的情况下，连郊区和隔壁城市都能探索一下。
不同的交通工具带来了不同的边界，每个人愿意踏出的距离也不同。如果不常出门的话，不妨从自己舒适的边界内开始探索，习惯了出门再把活动半径慢慢向外延展，用最舒服的方式感受新城市的魅力。
可以去哪里？
可供探索的地方有许多不同的分类方式，在这里我把它们分成了「固定设施」和「限期活动」两类。
「固定设施」指的是那些相对而言固定的建筑，在很长一段时间内都不会有关门谢客的顾虑，什么时候去都可以（不包括疫情这样的意外情况）。除了建筑之外，当地的景观和特色美食也属此列。
「限期活动」则是说只在限定时间内开展的活动，过期不候，像是艺术展或快闪店。对这些活动来说，消息来源是重中之重，我相信谁都不会希望「喜欢的艺术家要来开展了但是我看到 repo 已经是展览结束三天后了」这样的情况发生。
这两类地方的特点和探索方式略有不同，因此会在下面分别介绍。
固定设施
想要从头探索一座城市，最简单的做法是跟随游客的脚步，看看这里的知名景点。
地标景点通常承载了这座城市的历史和文化，在某种程度上，是这座城市过去、现在和未来的缩影。另外，正因为这些景点是大部分游客都不会避开的存在，相关…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自从疫情大流行以来，我们一直就在见证着改变历史的种种大事，从大到政治军事小到口罩文化，对整个世界都产生了不小的影响。而在疫情笼罩下的这一年，足坛也发生了太多事，足以改变和影响未来，年终了我们就来盘一盘，今年的足坛里发生了哪些称的上是“蝴蝶效应”，足够影响未来足坛的事件。
新冠疫情的影响继续，哪天是个头
新冠疫情是这两年全球都逃不开的大背景。不论是国内还是国外，太多人的生活在2020年疫情开始后就彻底改变了命运线，足坛也是如此。
就在我写下这些文字的时候，疫情的影响使得德国等国足球联赛又开始实行空场政策，西班牙等国也重新开始限制观众入场人数，而因为疫情导致多队赛程推迟的英超尽管没有通知停赛或者空场，但像皇马、切尔西、曼联这样人才储备丰富的球队因新冠也面临无人可用。

（图）国际新闻里疫情重新影响足坛
球队缺兵少将是新冠对球队带来的直接冲击，从长远来看，新冠疫情直接影响了足球这项运动赖以生存的场景，也就是与球迷观众形成的互动。
毕竟足球只有在有球迷观众时，流量热度和商业价值才能有的放矢。
据《镜报》报道，疫情影响欧洲足球俱乐部共遭遇87亿欧元损失，其中顶级联赛72亿欧元，其余级别15亿欧元。按收入类别，球票收入损失40亿欧元，赞助收入减少27亿欧元，转播收入减少14亿欧元。报告还表示，整个欧洲共有15家顶级联赛球队37家次级联赛球队申请破产，这一数字超过了2011年35家破产的纪录。


（图）欧足联主席切费林今年“吃”相也很难看
前不久拜仁名宿鲁梅尼格也表示，每进行一次空场比赛时，拜仁会遭受四百多万欧元的收入损失。想想对于拜仁这种家大业大的球队，疫情带来的损失就这么严重，那么对于一些中小俱乐部，几乎就是灭顶之灾。
更令人有所担忧的是，那些已经感染过新冠的球员到底有没有后遗症，有没有后续并发症的影响这个还是个隐藏的不安因素。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在我的知识星球「玉树芝兰」上，有一位名叫 Kevin 的朋友提了这样一个问题（简明起见，问题原文经过编辑）：

我是一名工具爱好者，但一直没怎么接触过电脑；对于稍微懂些计算机的人看来是很常识性的东西，我却感到力不从心、没有把握。由于不了解相关的计算机知识和底层逻辑，我虽然也能使用 Zotero、DEVONthink、Obsidian 等生产力工具，但总是浅尝辄止，难以到位；这让我在创作时感到一定的负担，无法达到「随心所欲」的状态。
其实我的要求也不高，就是希望弥补自己的计算机知识，达到足以理解当前所使用工具的程度。但不知道为此需要学习哪些背景知识，例如简明的 Python 语言课程或者计算机通识书籍。很希望老师能推荐一些经典、优质的资源。

我觉得这是个很有代表性的问题，所以在此把答案分享给你。以下是我的答复（有改动）。

Kevin 你好！
我们把问题梳理一下。如果你的需求刚好和工具提供的功能匹配，我想你是不会感觉到「力不从心」的，也不必去顾虑自己对计算机底层逻辑和计算机语言知识欠缺，正常使用就好。你有这个疑问，很可能是因为你的需求与工具功能不完全一致。所以，你想做的，是打造个性化的高效工作流，需要对工具进行改动、补充或者综合。如果我的理解不准确，欢迎你补充。
「懂」与「不懂」，差别在哪？
想想看为什么我们会喜欢效率工具，其实它帮助我们包裹了一些实现细节，给我们提供了好用的功能。如果你对计算机底层了如指掌，那大可不必去追逐工具的更新，或者天天尝试新工具，而应该自己来改造甚至全新设计合适于自己的工具。
就拿编辑器来说，VS Code 出现之前，计算机界「自古以来」有两大阵营，分别是 Vim 和 Emacs 。

Emacs 就是个典型的可扩展工具，号称是「伪装成了编辑器的操作系统」。如果你掌握了 Lisp 语言，那么可以自己开发上面的各种宏和插件，简直就是千变万化。你看，那…]]></summary>

2021年一整年，只有一次日全食，发生在12月4日国际标准时7点44分的南极洲。这个时刻被卫星拍到了，可以看到南极洲是黑的，这表明月亮此时就在南极的正上方，这个过程持续了2分钟。（via）
本周话题：产品化思维
上周四，华为发布了一款血压手表，戴在手腕上就能测血压。

它的实现很独特，可能是第一个这么设计的手表。

大家看上图，它的表带里面有一个垫层，那是一个微型气囊。
测血压时，手表向气囊充气，使它鼓起来挤压手腕（下图），从而感受到心跳和血压。

我看着这个设计，觉得似曾相识，这不就是腕式血压计吗？


华为的这块血压手表，简直就是腕式血压计的迷你版。但是，大家知道吗，两者的差价有多大？前者的官方定价是2988元，后者只要100多元人民币。
当然，我知道不能这样比较，血压手表是智能产品，有许多其他功能。但是，它的主要卖点不就是测血压吗？这一点上，它并不比腕式血压计强太多。你只需要5%的钱，就能得到一个方便程度差不多、测量结果可能更准确的设备。
我并不是说华为这个手表不好，只是感叹两者的差价这么大。为什么那些血压计厂商就没有想到，血压计可以做成一块手表呢？ 
既然已经可以戴在手腕上，为什么不索性做得再小一点呢？加入计时功能，配上彩色屏幕和操作系统，马上就变成了血压手表，价格可以提升一个数量级啊。
这么显而易见的一个产品思路，那么多血压计厂商怎么会无人想到呢？
这就是缺乏"产品化思维"的表现，不善于把功能提升为产品，然后推向市场。 如果腕式血压计的厂商具备产品化思维，看到自己的产品，就会想到手表市场，甚至可穿戴设备市场。反过来，华为的产…]]></summary>

It's that time of year again where I do the very very very terrible decision of going to a shooting range and explosives field to destroy USBS and man this year was fun, I got to mess with A C I D and a few toxic folks from tiktok (No you won't get my tiktok, ever) to give suggestions on how to destroy, mangle, melt and vaporize my USBS this year... those were some terrible choices, glad I brought earplugs haha.
So first off, I decided I'd use music to my advantage and I got a very special type of chemical in my posession that quite literally acts like an acid when you sing or play a Bb next to it.
For the rest of my USBS, I decided I'd go ahead and use a sniper rifle on half, and explode the rest using low grade C4 (learned my lesson from last year using high grade!) and man was that fun!
I can't say too much about the rest but I will probably post an image or two to twitter later!
Jonyk5 OUT!

Amidst all the chaos of pandemic that 2020 brought upon us, I did not plan extensively for 2021 but instead I focused on a theme.
I wanted the year of 2021 to be my year of YES.
I decided to not hesitate when new opportunities come up and go for exploring new things in life.
There were three high-level things which I wrote to focus on 1st January 2021 in my journal, they were: 
Health
Career
Growth 
I had multiple health issues and I wanted to focus on improving it.

This hasn't stopped us from delivering amazing software and do good deeds though - Au contraire! Think of global remote hackathons, local efforts to create services that help people in need, providing schools with old laptops, the list goes on. 
Arguably, the tech industry has adapted rather quickly. Video calls became a widespread norm, employees of some companies, like Twitter, can now work from home forever if they want.
(As a little disclaimer: I'll use the word "remote" in this post to describe non-onsite things in general, even if you're in the same town as your peers.)
With the new remote situation came a few hurdles, though. And in this post I want to discus…]]></summary>

When using Markdown in a website, there is always a compile step in which all the syntax markdown is converted into the HTML that the browser can understand. The problem with using plain Markdown is that you are limited to the handful amount of HTML elements that markdown is aware of. With MDX, you can extend those elements with your custom React components. It looks something like this:

This testing system was working for a while but then someone else suggested that I should start using a linter. The linter ended up breaking all of my testing code, and before long I had spend nearly three hours getting them working together. 
Here was the project if you want to check it out
After that, I was told that the code was inconsistently formatted, so I needed to add a prettier system. All of my engineers are now telling me that they have lost countless man-hours battling against this new integration system.
So, I’m getting rid of it. My entire linter system, code grading, beautifier, etc. is gone. And, I’m replacing it with my own solution- if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. 
I want to hear what struggles you have had with your “systems to boost efficiency”, or if you think I am completely wrong and should shut up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a beginner programmer, it’s difficult to decide which programming language to learn first. The software development industry is fast-paced, and the market is constantly changing. There are over 700 programming languages in use, and each of those languages has its own advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. 
So, how do you decide where to begin? 
Well, the good news is that learning any language will open up doors and create new opportunities for you. In this article, we’ll explore the different types of programming languages, along with how to choose the best first language for your personal and professional goals. Then, we’ll give an overview of some of the most popular languages in use today.

As his creator defined, SQLModel is a Python library for interacting with SQL databases. It is based on Python type hints, and it uses Pydantic and SQLAlchemy internally. We can argue that SQLModel is just a layer on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.
SQLModel was created by the same person who created FastAPI, so you can expect a pleasant and flawless integration between both.
Although SQLModel was launched no more than 4 months ago (at the time of writing this), it already offers many features, and some others are already being developed, I encourage you to give it a try.

Elixir is a process-oriented, functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). The language was influenced by Ruby. This inspiration can be seen and felt in Elixir's ecosystem and tooling options. Elixir is known to be easy to learn and widely applicable within the software development industry. 
In this beginner's tutorial, I'll walk you through the Elixir language and discuss its use cases, tools, syntax, and much more.
Let's get started!
We’ll cover:

@宇宙浪费指南：《山月记》 

我深怕自己本非美玉，故而不敢加以刻苦琢磨，却又半信自己是块美玉，故又不肯庸庸碌碌，与瓦砾为伍。于是我渐渐地脱离凡尘，疏远世人，结果便是一任愤懑与羞恨日益助长内心那怯弱的自尊心。

也许，很多人初识《山月记》甚至初识中岛敦，都是因为这段话吧，我也是被这个狠狠戳中，才找来原书看。
简单来说，《山月记》可以被认为是一本同人文，小说取材于中国古典故事，如《左传》《论语》《庄子》《史记》《西游记》及唐传奇。中岛敦将古典人物抽离出来，重新灌注以思想，在这本书里，历史不是主线，更不是背景板，主角只有一个个古籍里的人物，有在自傲与自卑之间无所逃遁最终异化为老虎的李征，有不停追问生命意义的沙僧悟净，也有战败被俘后被迫投降的李陵......他笔下的人物超越了史书中刻板印象，变成一个个真实、有血有肉的形象。
有人说，这本书能帮助青年们对抗虚无主义，的确，我们从这些人物中感受到他们在时代和自我之间的对抗、感受孤独、悲悯和勇气。
在李征篇，书中通过他的大量心理对白把他的自恋和自伤展现得淋漓尽致，一个自卑又自负的诗人鲜活的站在我们眼前，而他想一边想入仕一边又鄙夷的想法也深深刺痛一直在懦弱的自尊心和自大的羞耻心之间来回拉扯的读者们；而李陵篇中，书里的三个主角司马迁、李陵和苏武虽是我们耳熟能详的历史人物，中岛敦对他们的故事也有自己的解读，在他的笔下，司马迁不再是那个即使遭遇了如此磨难也毫不动摇的完成《史记》的人，他崩…]]></summary>

在不少家长心中，网络和游戏依然是洪水猛兽。面对家长、社会和孩子之间围绕「如何正确使用网络」而产生的矛盾，我们也不禁思索：拔网线、砸电脑，真的可以挽救已经沉迷网络的孩子吗？到底是什么原因让青少年沉迷网络呢？有没有一些客观的衡量标准来判断一个青少年——甚至一名成人——是否已经沉迷网络？在本期节目中，我们邀请到了中国青少年研究中心少年儿童研究所所长孙宏艳，和我们详细聊聊青少年网络防沉迷的相关话题。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[科技是一种人文素养，我认为 Swift Playgrounds App 的核心定位正是如此。
未来世界创新、创业、创造的大门，需要我们用一种有着人文温度的方式去开启。
我自己从初中开始看硅谷三大春晚——Apple WWDC 开发者大会、谷歌I/O 大会、微软Build 大会；在高中的时候，虽然身为文科生，但是开始了装「黑苹果」、自学编程的神秘炼金术之旅。Swift 因此成了我的计算机语言母语，而大学时期也很幸运地入选了 WWDC18 奖学金计划，能够带着我们团队自己开发的 App 见到了库克。我们后来休学创业，拿了几轮融资，至今还在这个波诡云谲却充满魔力的创业场拼搏。
这些过去的经历，都成了乔布斯所说的「connecting the dots」的一部分。我和一家做少儿素质与编程教育的机构也有着不少的合作，也带过几支天才少年队伍，看着他们忘我地投入，看着他们迸发着颠覆性创造力的光芒。
由 Apple 推出的编程工具 Swift Playgrounds 近期推出了 4.0 大版本，我使用它开发了一个简单的疫情数据看板 App，并以此作为一次简单的体验，将过程中的思考和体悟和大家分享。
我们为何学习编程、如何学习创造，Apple 给了我们他们的思考。虽然 Swift Playgrounds 现在还充满了各种瑕疵，但我们也看到了全新的可能：AR、AI、传感器、多维交互、物联网，这些前沿的技术，以及伴随其中的人文主义光辉，都能够在这个小小的设备中，经由每一个开发者的研磨，如同坩埚一般，炼就出自己的结晶。
让我们开始吧。
本文概要

Swift Playgrounds 更新了4.0大版本，可以在 iPad 中实现 App 的开发并发布到 App Store。
我尝试着在上面写了一个疫情数据实时看板 App，并将代码开源在了 GitHub。

开发体验充满了惊喜与迷思。虽然 SwiftU…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

少数派的朋友们大家好，我是名字很正直的朴步成，名字扒自郭德纲老师的著名相声，是于谦老师众多称呼中，本人最喜欢的一个。是老麦的颜粉，是少数派的读者，看到城市漫游指南系列之后，忍不住想要与大家分享我的小城市，Plymouth 普利茅斯。
机缘巧合我来到了这座海滨城市上大学，对于在海口生活了二十余年的人而言，确实是一件新鲜事。记录一些陪我们走过青春的，一座小城的往事；分享一些对今后，有缘前往南英格兰的朋友们，未必有用的帮助。
英国非著名港口城市 - 普利茅斯

普利茅斯位于南英格兰德文郡（Devon），临近盛产小精灵的康沃尔郡（Cornwall），和如果不查资料无论如何想不起来的：萨默塞特郡、多塞特郡。
苦于其尴尬的城市定位，普利茅斯只能一度自称英国最安全的城市之一，但这没有任何吸引力和含金量的榜单，甚至 2016 年以后也未能再见到普利茅斯的名字。更何况作为旅游目的地，不如可以便宜购物的卡迪夫、「天涯海角」 彭赞斯；求学而言，比起周围的埃克塞特、巴斯，南安普顿和布里斯托又差了不少。

普利茅斯的话，若是独行，便不必去了。
—— 鲁迅
铁轨与行人几乎是触手可及的距离
从伦敦希思罗出了航站楼，直达普利茅斯最舒服的方法是坐大巴，但你若是一个旅行者，绝不能错过驶向南英格兰的火车。切记坐在南边靠窗的位置，火车上最能感受南英格兰壮丽的海岸线。
关于普利茅斯，其实可以不说的一些事儿
「五月花号」离岗的海湾，也是每个旅行者必拍的景色
每一个有缘到访普利茅斯的人，都会听到那一段被传颂的历史，普…]]></summary>

Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world's tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn't see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town.

My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!

This speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto” tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Celebrate with Miranda, Beatriz and the rest of the “Encanto” family streaming now on Disney+.

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

这是一个信息爆炸的时代，大多数人陷入信息洪流难以自拔。为了避免这种情况的发生，我们不得不使用一些手段捍卫自己的信息流。

我们需要阅读工作流

每天，我们睁开眼后的第一件事不是上厕所，而是打开手机。手机屏幕已经有十几条早间新闻推送在等候我们的阅读。在通勤路上，我们如果不是在刷短视频，便是在微博、知乎等平台查看一些实时热点。到工作单位以后，我们打开经常访问的网站，查看需要阅读的内容，并将其保存至书签或者稍后读软件。即便是在短暂的如厕时间，打开微博等资讯平台刷一刷早已成为标准操作。
直到睡前的最后一刻，我才发现尽管我每天一直在不停地阅读各种信息，然而绝大部分阅读内容却成为过眼烟云。各种信息如流沙般随风而逝，我甚至想不起我十分钟之前的阅读内容。在饕餮快感之外，我几乎没有多少阅读所得，可能唯一的收获便是阅读内容时所激起情绪涟漪。

那么，如何在信息过载时代高效地处理信息流呢？

从长期来看，自然是提高我们选择、查找、评估和利用信息的技巧和能力，也就是所谓的提高信息素养。然而，提高信息素养并非一朝一夕之事，需要经过一定的训练和长期的实战。从短期来看，比较实用的办法便是建立阅读工作流，以对抗信息流沙。一个可靠的、标准化的阅读流程，可以使我们在尽量减少意志力、情感等精力消耗的情况下，辅助我们高效完成日常的信息管理。
我的信息管理方案
我的信息管理工具
从信息管理的流程来看，我们可以从信息获取、信息阅读和信息处理这三个阶段对信息管理进行分解。
工欲善其事，必先利其器。经过一段时间的摸索，我找到了以建立阅读工作流为目的的信息管理流程。

I am curious on what did you do during the long holiday - either personal and professional wise. Below is my story. 
Spent my leave on staycation. I hang out with the family and in-laws. Lots of shopping and ice skating.


Ate a bunch of unhealthy food I shouldn't be eating - more than what I imagined. Major diet after New Year to follow. 😊


Finally, wrote couple of ReactJS articles here at dev.to and created a video version that I am very proud of (still honing my video recording skills). Below are the links if you want to check it out. 



Thanks for the dev.to community for a great, warm support of the articles.

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 
HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Metadata etc.
BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>

    <body>     
    </body>
</html>

<html>: This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.
All the HTML elements that can be used inside the <head>element are:
<style>, <title>, <base>, <noscript>, <script>, and <meta>
<base>


The <base> HTML element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one  element in a document.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys, 
instead of a new article, I'd like to share two printable cheatsheets with you. 
I hope you'll find these useful.
The first cheatsheet shows a common development workflow when working on a development project. Among these are:
How to initialize a Git repository
How to add and remove files from the Git repos
How to manage code changes over several new features

Get the PDF from my Git repos: https://github.com/tq-bit/dev-cheatsheets/blob/main/q-bit_cheatsheets_git_and_github_IGit%20Cheatsheet_I.pdf
The second cheatsheet shows you a common, distributed development pattern and visualizes how several maintainers work on the same codebase. 
It attempts to answer the questions about: 
How does a pull request work?
How are local and remote repositories synchronized?
How to delete a remote branch?

Of course I knew they were important before - everybody does - but it's so easy to just push it aside and focus on more exciting code, or write some perfunctory tests that don't really, well, test anything. Eventually, however, slacking off on testing comes back to bite you; for me, luckily, it did when things were only getting started, but the point was clear - writing good tests is a top priority.
For Agrippa, however, writing good tests is far from trivial - it's a CLI for generating React components based on a project's environment (dependencies, existence of config files, etc.), as well as an optional .agripparc.json config. In other words, a lot of its work is reading & parsing comm…]]></summary>

Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language. Generally, we love object-oriented (OOP) programming! Object-oriented programming makes our code readable, reusable, modular, and is generally pretty simple paradigm to get our heads around.
In Ruby, everything is an object. We generally divide up our code into Classes and Instances, so this isn't an unfamiliar concept. Really, everything!
Let's try it out!
self
# => main

self.class
# => Object

nil.class
# => NilClass

true.class
# => TrueClass

Even nil? Yes, nil is the singleton instance of NilClass.
Okay, what is this main thing? Well, main is the default top level context provided to us in Ruby. Since everything is an object, we call this the global object. But even our global…]]></summary>

At Facets.cloud we are planning to have a series of articles that aim to explain some of the complex cloud pricing logic and when you need to use them.
AWS RIs are a great way to obtain a discount on your always running workloads (base compute) by committing for certain duration like 1 year or 3 years. Typically, you would look at your base on-demand compute to determine how many RIs to purchase at any time. This is all great in the normal course i.e. your business is growing and you are increasing the cloud spend and possibly buying more RIs time-to-time.
For AWS too, it is a good deal as they get assured future business and lock-in. Another important point to note is that for cloud providers, the cost of an instance, storage or any other services reduces year on year. This…]]></summary>

These eight productivity tips will supercharge your productivity as developer. You'll save hours of time which you can then invest in other activities.
This is not a complete list of everything you should be doing, but these things alone will drastically improve your productivity if you are not already doing them.
Lets say you are writing code in an old Java monolith and your flow for every change you make looks something like this:
Save file (1 second)
 Build Project in IDE (5 seconds)
 Deploy application war file into old J2EE container (30 seconds)
For every change it takes 36 seconds before you can get feedback and try out your changes. This might not sound like a lot, but if you are doing this for every change this might happen 50 or more times per day. That's 1800 seco…]]></summary>

Have you ever run into the red screen of horror while debugging a flutter app?

I mean, if you haven’t, are you a Flutter developer at all?
Out of numerous reasons for your app to relay your error in such a manner, null errors are one of the most common. In an attempt to eliminate this and the numerous null errors that occur while building/debugging your app, the great Flutter and Dart team introduced Null Safety.
In simple terms, Null Safety allows the dart analyser to detect possible null errors pre-compilation, that is, before you even run your app. It ensures proper notifications of possible null data that could break your app while running.
This article is for you, if
You understand the basics of data types in Dart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言
11 月底，一则 「微信更新外链规则」 的新闻在国内引发了不小的涟漪。在《关于〈微信外部链接内容管理规范〉的更新说明》中，微信宣布，将在点对点聊天中允许直接访问外部链接，而在群聊中试行允许直接访问电商类链接。
尽管这条新闻细读之下有些讽刺——本意促进互联互通的链接，竟然要受制于一个平台的生杀予夺，而微信的调整也有点不情不愿、半遮半掩，但这总算是往健康、开放的方向迈了一步。
而同一时间，国外也有一群人在为「链接」的未来发出呼吁。不过，他们想得要更远一些。
12 月初，一份名为 《泛在链接宣言》（Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking）的文档出现在互联网上。简而言之，这份《宣言》（正文翻译见文末附录）向开发者呼吁：通过调整界面设计、提供 API 等方式，让用户能方便地通过链接访问应用内资源，从而提高工作效率、维持专注。

打个比方，如果你在笔记里写了一句「参见周一的会议记录」，那么应该能给「会议记录」四个字加上链接，点击后就能直接打开当时做记录的 Word 文档；在任务清单里写了一条「阅读某篇论文」，应该可以把「论文」链接到想要看的那份 PDF 文件。更理想地，你应该还能在上述 Word 或 PDF 文件中加一个反方向的链接，点击即可直接打开提到了它们的笔记或清单，方便继续写作、标记任务完成等。

如果你对近年红得发紫的「双向链接」笔记有所耳闻，应该会觉得上面的描述看着挺眼熟——这差不多就是将笔记场景中的双向链接推广和化用到了系统的各个角落。
确实，这些效果本来也不是什么「黑科技」，目前都能在某种程度上实现，只是远不够完美：要么依赖于应用和平台的特殊支持，但老死不相往来；要么薄如蝉翼，容易随着文件移动、设备更换而失效；要么晦涩难用，让普通用户一看就打消了学习的念头。
《泛在链接宣言》所呼吁的，正是让这种灵活的链接用法变得更通用、开放、稳固和易用。…]]></summary>

「手帐」（手帳，techō）是一个日语词，在中文中与之最相近的概念应当是「行事历」，但近年来手帐的流行趋势已经和只关注规划、待办事项的行事历有了区别。这件事同样体现在西方的手帐社区。当大家提及手帐时，使用的不只是代表行事历的「Planner」，更多的还有「Journal」——它除了记录待办事项、规划生活之外，还可以作为日记进行生活记录，用文字、插图、贴画等等一系列内容填充带有分区设计的本子，形成一个属于自己的生活轨迹地图。

手帐文化中，「自由度」是非常重要的元素。本质上，选择一本手帐的过程，就是设计自己的生活笔记体系的过程。每个人的需求各有不同，手帐社区中有不少人常常分享自己的手帐体系（比如上图的视频作者 AmandaRachLee，知名文具/日志/美妆 YouTuber），介绍手帐本的各种用法。也有很多资深用户在使用大量的量产手帐之后，选择自己购买空白本，从零开始设计这一年的手帐体系。所以我在这里需要强调，如果你想记录自己的生活，并不一定要购买专门的手帐本，你需要的只是一份持之以恒的心思，以及对自己生活的一些关注与反思，就能设计出最最适合自己的手帐体系。
但对于此前从未接触过手帐的人来说，想要入门手帐体系，最好还是从现成的专门手帐本入手。尤其已经经历大量市场考验的手帐品牌与型号，它们的本子设计已经经过了无数次调整（甚至每年都有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021 年已然接近尾声，以 Notion 为代表的「块编辑器」经过多年的发展也早已不是新鲜概念，成为了新兴文字编辑器的 de facto 交互选择。
Craft 在 1.0 时代就因其完整的文字编辑功能、优秀的共享协作体验，以及拥有非 electron-based 的跨 macOS、iOS、iPadOS 三大平台的原生客户端而饱受好评。Craft 让文字工作者在 Apple 生态圈中首次拥有了支持多人协作的原生「块编辑器」，且 Craft 目标明确 —— 专心做好以「原生客户端」为重心的线上文档协作、个人文档撰写的最佳工具。

设计精美、功能强大，Apple 用户的文档工具新选择：Craft
App Store Awards 2021 年度大奖出炉，我们和获奖开发者们聊了聊
少数派 2020 年度应用：这 16 款年度应用，和往年不太一样
在 iOS、macOS 和 iPadOS 三端都拥有原生客户端的 Craft。
事实上，Craft 1.0 也做到了这一点：专注文字撰写，放弃做一个「大一统」应用，让使用 Craft 的我们专注于自己的个性化 workflow，而非以应用本身为中心来调整自己。但我们在工作学习中，不可能全程使用同一个应用，我们需要浏览网站、浏览其他应用来获取信息，需要在应用中处理、编辑内容，需要将内容导出、发布、分享、汇总。为此，在 Craft 2.0 大版本更新中，Craft X —— Craft 自己的「插件、扩展系统」应运而生。
Craft X 设计理念
Craft eXtension，简称 Craft X，是 Craft 2.0 时代的重磅更新，为 Craft 核心编辑体验带来更多可能性。Craft X 的重点是一套完整的 Craft API，用来辅助我们在 Craft 中的工作流。其中我们在前文的介绍中所讲，Craft X 的设计理念…]]></summary>

它是做卫生的大魔王工具
是的，我认为它是整理家庭卫生的「大魔王」。没有它处理不了的污渍。无论是泼在地上的汤汤水水，还是洒在地上的颜料，抑或是顽固的油污，抱歉，蒸汽拖把没在怕的。有它在基本上不存在解决不了的地面污渍。
出国在外，很长一段时间家里是我妈在做卫生，所以我一直不知道家里卫生是怎么做的。等我回来，我才发现家里换了个我没见过的玩意儿。后来才知道是蒸汽拖把。回来后就换我做家里的卫生，于是第一项任务就是解决家里厨房那被油烟熏入味儿的地面。
怎么说那个地面呢，就像是地表有一层浅浅的胶水，拖鞋走上去、抬起来，会发出「嘶啦」的声音，粘滞感有，但没有那么强，属于那种让你能感觉得到，却不会造成你行动不便的程度。毫不夸张地说，拖一遍以后，地砖就发出了光泽。你能明显感觉到那股粘滞感已经基本消失。拖鞋踩在上面再也没有那种「嘶啦声」发出。一切顺滑，恢复了地砖该有的平滑感觉。
效果真的显著
它是洗地机吗
先说结论，它「不是」洗地机。
借着这次搬家，我才想着说，把这东西拎出来讲一讲。一开始我以为这东西挺冷门，最后在飞书群一问，挺多人想看看的。
可能初看很多人都会认为这是个洗地机。其实它是蒸汽拖把哒（DIO 脸）！最常见的洗地机我相信大家都看过，就是某些型号的洒水车。我们平时路上会见到那种车身两边带着旋转型刷头的那种洒水车，就是比较常见的「洗地机」。体积笨重、需要一定的操作能力。然后再简化一下，就是家用的洗地机了。
比较好一点的家用洗地机，就是 KARCHER 的洗地机。刚解除隔离的那天，我就迫不及待地驱车去家附近的山姆会员店逛逛了。刚好电器区有 KAR…]]></summary>

Since that initial deployment, the multiplayer system has experienced no downtime or service degradation. And best of all, I've paid nothing to host the service and therefore I am able to allow others to play for free. This article is an overview of how I designed this system from the ground up.
In short, Farmhand is a game that mixes farming and market mechanics. The goal is to buy seeds for a low price, plant and harvest them, and then sell the crops at a high price. Prices fluctuate from day-to-day, so you'll have to be smart about your buy/sell decisions.
Farmhand was initially designed as a single-player game and seed/crop values were randomly generated at the sta…]]></summary>

Hi, José,
Masakazu Mori (He made a presentation at ElixirConf US 2021 [1]) and I lecture the course "Programming Theory" at the University of Kitakyushu, including the mainstream programming paradigms: imperative programming, OOP, and functional programming, relating to the history of the architecture of the computer systems. Of course, one of the course's main topics is "Why Elixir?". In Programming Elixir [2], Dave Thomas said, "I don't want to hide data. I want to transform it." I identified this consideration as a new programming paradigm instead of functional programming: The data transformation paradigm.
So, I want to interview you about the history of what you consider about desig…]]></summary>

You will need a way to run another process alongside vim, here are a couple ideas to get you going that are not the focus here.style

Nós utilizaremos o QEMU para emular um macOS e dentro dele, utilizaremos o xCode para emular um iOS, só nisso você já consegue perceber que não vai ser uma coisa leve.

But now!!!! when I see back in time currently I m doing great progress and easily learning new technologies😁.
But actually what I did or steps I took cause of which I m doing great progress within a year.

Many things helped me learning new technical things but let start this first article let me share with you how Open Source helped me
How I m Learning new Technologies so Quickly is coming soon...)
I started Open Source Contribution in November 2020 somewhat and I made my first contribution to github-docs as a contributor cause only text and typo were needed to be corrected which was perfect for a beginner like me to get started with open source contribu…]]></summary>

I would like to analyze this result, but this data is compressed.
In this Section. I'll explain about dns compression.
According to  (RFC1035)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035], We can specify the location to be referenced by OFFSET in the following format.
a domain name represented as a sequence of labels, where each label consists of a length octet followed by that number of octets.  

The domain name terminates with the zero length octet for the null label of the root.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh the technical interviews, I am a 15 years experienced software engineer and I'm still afraid of them!. So we as human beings fear the unknown, but a good interview should be more like a conversation instead of a police interrogation.
Interviewers have asked me if I know S.O.L.I.D. principles, unit testing in deep and even I've been asked to use graph theory to solve a problem. When I got the job, there is a high dependency on a specific dll that do a lot of different things (This by it's own violates all SOLID principles), I never used anything they asked me, so what's the need to make the technical interview unnecessarily complex and tedious?. When I am interviewing a candidate I try to make a conversation like: Tell me about your experience, the latest project you are working on, what technology you like the most, and why. I guess that they are trying to emulate top-tech companies like GAFAM, what I have heard about these companies is that the technical interviews are very focused on data structures and problem-solving (not sure if they are used in daily work).
My point is: if your company focuses on a specific product, ask what you're looking for, ask for the technologies you are currently using, please stop doing stupidly complex technical tests unless your company is currently using these techniques to solve complex problems.
And as always, happy coding!.]]></summary>

Welcome to the Secrets of MicroPython tutorial series! MicroPython is an incredible tool for rapidly prototyping and iterating on hardware projects. It's similar to Arduino but instead of using C++, which you have to re-compile each time you make a code change, it runs on the Python interpreter which allows you to run code changes immediately. The quick feedback cycle enabled by MicroPython will, I believe, power the future of embedded development.
What is the "hello world" of embedded software? Why, blinking an LED, of course! In this first tutorial, we'll get you acquainted with the fundamentals of MicroPython and more importantly, the online simulator we'll be using for all the tutorials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on my website for some time now, but it felt like there was something missing. I wasn't really sure what it was, so I ignored it for a bit of time. Later that week, I was hanging out with friends and we started making puns about ducks- "wisequacks". That's when I had a moment of realization. 
I decided to drop everything that I was doing and build a really simple API for duck jokes. Right now the API has a couple of jokes, but we need some more, so if you want to submit some, you can respond to this issue or you can just drop a pull request on this repository. 
You can check out the joke API here and you can use it in any of your projects if you would like. All of the code for the project can be found in the linked repository and it is all under the MIT license if you want to use it in your own project. Cheers! 
Make Sure to Drop the Repository a Star if You Like It!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[现在你已经很难找到一款带有 3.5mm 耳机插孔的数码设备了。
这或许是厂商「希望」听音乐不再有线材的束缚，也或许是真的技术发展所致导致设备已经容纳不了一个小小的 3.5mm 耳机接口了，似乎真的要和有线耳机拜拜了？除了换成「真无线耳机」之外，有没有什么办法让我们耗费巨资购买的有线耳机也能赶上时代，重新在手机上继续发光发热，甚至可以兼顾无线耳机的便携性以及高保真耳机的高音质呢？
传统耳机也能「无线听歌」
上面一大段并非是个人臆想，而是自己的亲身经历——拥有一条四千块大洋拿下的威士顿 W50，又换上了索尼的 MUC-M12SM2 耳机线——我希望既不需要更换手上的高品质设备，又能「无线听歌」。
好在威士顿 W50 采用的是 MMCX 插孔的可换线设计，因此变成蓝牙耳机其实并不复杂——再买一个索尼 MUC-M2BT1 蓝牙耳机的适配器就可以秒变挂脖式的蓝牙耳机。因为原生支持 LDAC 无线蓝牙技术，这样实现即保证了音质（CD 级别的无损音频传输），又摆脱的线材的束缚。不过这种解决方案也存在不方便之处，一方面是想再次换回 3.5mm 耳机插孔的时候，需要频繁地换线插拔接口，另一方面就是无法预测蓝牙适配器的电量使用情况，经常听到一半突然没电。更重要的是，我的索尼 MUC-M12SM2 耳机线就无用武之地了。
可将任意 2.5/3.5mm 有线耳机「蓝牙化」
所以拿到飞傲 BTR5 2021 时，我第一时间就是将耳机线接了回去，然后将它和我的安卓手机进行蓝牙配对——BTR5 2021 支持 LDAC 蓝牙音频协议，至少保证了最为基本的无损音质（接近 CD 品质的无损音频），而 3.5mm 耳机口的输出让我不用频繁换线就能继续使用我的 W50。
也可有线获得更高音质
BTR5 2021 还标配一个小夹子水晶壳，出街的时候可以非常方便地夹在衣服或者裤子口袋中，还自带一个小的麦克风，有电话…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人类种植稻米的历史起源于中国。大米作为市面上最常见也是最为人所熟知的主食，经过数以千年记的发展、改良和创新，已经成为全球产量第二的食物。1中国自古就有「鱼米之乡」等词汇，充分体现了大米对于中国百姓生活的影响。而法国名厨乔治斯·奥古斯特·艾斯可菲（1848–1935）也曾感叹：「米饭是世界上最好、最营养的——而且毫无疑问，它也是最普遍的主食。」由此不难看出，无论对于东方还是西方人，米饭都有这独特而浓厚的吸引力。
那么，作为一种看似平凡却又历史悠久的食物，我们又有哪些方法可以在家庭餐桌上折腾出新花样呢？今天本文就列举一些好吃又好看的碳水大餐！
开篇之前：袁隆平大米上架少数派商城啦
蒸一碗热腾腾的米饭，再炒两个快手菜，能让胃和身体都温暖起来，驱走冬日的严寒。我们也专门为我派读者们准备了由国货品牌「隆平农场」出品的高品质大米「袁隆平大米」。这款大米产自东北辽河，从苗种到耕种都经过精心培育，好吃不贵。
「袁隆平大米」5 公斤装原价 79 元，我派商城特惠价 69 元。

基础材料和准备
既然聊米饭的烹饪，那重头戏当然就是米啦。我家的口味是喜欢吃东北大米，口感圆润，极富光泽感，颗粒分明又入口软糯，看着一碗可爱蓬蓬的、发亮的米饭总是会有幸福感，有时都不需要太多配菜，好的米干吃起来都不至于乏味涩嘴，并且煮干煮稀都适用，既可以粒粒分明也可以浓浓汤水。
我认为好好吃饭是生活中看似日常却会潜移默化影响身心的事情，越基础的食材越重要。有时宁愿多肥两斤，也不愿放弃碳水的快乐。

家电厨具就是电饭煲、砂锅等一般家庭中都有配备的用品，只是煮白米饭的话用电饭锅就可以了，方便又快捷。不过依据我的个人经验，电饭煲的价格、工艺对煮出来的饭确实是有一定影响的，在米本身处于及格线的情况下，更好的材质、设计、用料能让同一款米的食用体验更上档次。
砂锅作为传统烹饪工具，在有时间的情况下选用它更能…]]></summary>

玩家群体对 Epic Games 当然不陌生，不少 3A 级的游戏都通过虚幻引擎开发。对于海外玩家来说，Epic 旗下的堡垒之夜最高月活跃用户在 2020 年超过了 8000 万，是海外最受欢迎的竞技类游戏。在过去几年，美国的中学和大学举办电竞，最多人参与的项目必然是堡垒之夜。对于中国玩家来说，备受关注的黑神话：悟空就是使用 UE5 开发，并且得到了 Epic 官方的技术支持。Epic Games 也在不同场合秀出 UE5 的“肌肉”，包括在 PS5 主机上的实机展示，最近也有黑客帝国：觉醒的 demo 供玩家体验。
黑客帝国：觉醒 demo
在相当一段时间以来，Epic 是我最感兴趣的公司之一。我在美国读书的时候，学校离 Epic 总部只有 20 分钟车程。Epic 所在的北卡州 Cary 市是一个富人小镇，也是一个 foodie town。虽然我也偶尔去 Cary 饕餮一番，但却没有机会走近 Epic 一睹真容。但因为离得不远，也结识了几个在 Epic 工作的朋友。

少年极客


Tim Sweeney 1970 年出生于美国东海岸马里兰州 Potomac 市，是家中三兄弟里面年纪最小的一个。Tim 的两个哥哥分别比他年长 15 岁和 10 岁——当 Tim 开始读小学时，两个哥哥离家读大学甚至已经毕业了，因此 Tim 在成年以前的大部分时间更像是家中独子，受到父母的关照。


和很多天才极客的成长故事类似，Tim Sweeney 在年幼的时候就喜欢捣鼓各类工具和机械设备。他曾经把家里的收音机、电视机和割草机 (一般美国家庭用来除草和平整草坪) 逐一拆解，来研究机械的运作原理。在五岁时，Tim 把家里的割草机拆解，然后再重新组装成一辆能够驾驶的卡丁车。他对于各种机械的兴趣，后来也逐渐延伸到了计算机和各类技术领域。


七十年代，电子游戏行业开始逐渐在美国建立。Noland Bushnell 在 1972 年创立雅达利 (Atari) 公司，并且相继推出了第一款在商业上取得成功的街机游戏 Pong 和后来风靡全球的 Space Invaders (国内玩家称为“小蜜蜂”，雅达利从日本大东公司购买了版权)，依靠投币式街机的游戏厅也开始在美国流行。Tim 十岁时，离家里不远处开了一家游戏厅，和很多青少年一样，Tim 也在里面流连忘返。后来，父母干脆买了一台 Atari 2600 家…]]></summary>

作为如今生活中不可或缺的一种文件格式，PDF 承载了太多内容形式 —— 海报、画册、宣传页、合同、报价单、教科书…… 其中可能需要签字、修改、阅读、批注的，也不在少数。现在，一直以来仅在 Windows 上有客户端的 PDF 标注软件 Drawboard PDF 也已经登陆 iOS 和 iPadOS，就让我们一探究竟。

在 iOS 和 iPadOS 上，Drawboard PDF 用起来怎么样？和 iPadOS 自带的 PencilKit，或者是 GoodNotes 一类笔记软件相比，Drawboard PDF 有什么优劣？在 iOS 上批注 PDF 方式如此之多的今日，Drawboard 是否值得迁移？

相信看完这篇文章，上面的几个问题，你的心中都会有满意的答案。
从各处打开 PDF 文档，还可以免费创建空白文档
如果你和我一样是 Drawboard 的新用户，打开 Drawboard PDF 的那一刻，app 会提示登录账户。除了可以使用传统的邮箱注册之外，当然也可以使用 Apple ID 来登录；或者，Drawboard PDF 也提供了不登录直接使用 Essentials 基本功能的选项。如果在体验后你发现自己无需使用高级功能，那么不注册账号也完全不会影响到 Drawboard PDF 的使用 —— 清爽、简单、直接，这也是 Drawboard PDF 给我的第一感觉。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[依然是出于一时兴趣进行的整理……非绝对权威，有错请指正
这篇文章会从JOJO中角色的名字、形象、设定等等方面进行原型的考证，由于量太大，第一次先整理前两部的主要角色原型及名字由来
考证大部分来源于6251、GOGO、Veller三本设定集，荒木老师访谈记录，以及部分边缘文字资料

幻影之血
先从第一部开始讲
迪奥·布兰度
迪奥的形象原型，是荒木老师早期作品《魔少年B.T》中的主角B.T
B.T
名“Dio”与姓“Brando”则来自分别现实中著名的重金属摇滚乐队DIO，以及著名演员马龙·白兰度
P.S：意大利语中，“dio”意为神明
DIO，美国重金属摇滚乐队，成立于1982年。成员包括主唱罗尼·詹姆斯·迪欧(DIO)、吉他手安东尼·伊奥米、鼓手威廉·沃德、贝斯手泰伦斯·巴特勒马龙·白兰度（Marlon Brando），美国著名影视演员、导演。代表作《教父》
乔纳森·乔斯达
大乔的形象应该出自原创，但名字的来历就有很多说法了
起初，荒木老师在06年特别访谈中说是家庭餐厅的名字（Jonathan)，因为最初在这家餐厅与编辑讨论漫画，所以以此命名。这应该是大家都听说过的
不过后来，荒木又在JOJOVELLER HISTORY中亲口否认了这点。椛岛良介也表示最初是在另一家餐厅进行磋商的，连载途中才变更到Jonathan。 
JOJOVELLER HISTORY
但事实上，日本关东确实有一个大型连锁家庭餐厅，名字也确实是乔纳森
Jonathan
关于前后表述不一问题，荒木老师本人是这样解释的 ↓↓↓
JOJOVOLLER HISTORY
别问，问就是老师自己也忘了
P.S：网上流传有另一种说法：在著名吸血鬼题材小说，爱尔兰作家斯托克的《德古拉》中，有一名重要角色名字即为乔纳森。
威廉·A·齐贝林
齐贝林家族的姓氏，来自于英国摇滚乐队Led Zeppelin（齐贝林飞艇）
齐柏林飞艇…]]></summary>

不过，你是否会想到罗马占卜术，暗杀风水学呢？
这篇文章，会粗浅整理JOJO世界观下的超自然力量体系。展现一个，JOJO式的奇妙世界之冰山一角

本文分三部分，分别为『基本世界』『新世界』『番外』
顾名思义，基本世界为1-6部，新世界为第七部往后的作品，番外则是《岸边露伴一动不动》《死神之Q》等非正篇内容

起点——基本世界
1、吸血鬼
少年时期的幼嫩迪奥
超越人类的物种，位于生物圈食物链第二层，视人类为食物
由石鬼面骨刺刺激人类脑部后转化，不可逆
拥有强大的身体力量和细胞活性，但在阳光下肉体会迅速崩溃成灰烬
与传统血族不同的是，他们不惧怕流水，洋葱，银，十字架等等“吸血鬼克制物”。
1.1、尸生人
原文为『zombie』（僵尸）
由吸血鬼对人类或尸体进行转化，制造出的物种，身体力量强于人类，听命于制造者
2、夜之一族（闇之一族）
アイアイアァァァ
上古生物，族人被称为『柱中人』，位于地球食物链顶端的生物，是一切生物的天敌，以吸血鬼为食
身体强度极强，拥有比吸血鬼更强大的力量，速度，和细胞活性。能通过接触同化细胞的方式吞噬其他生物
2.1、流法
夜之一族（柱男）通过开发身体完成的，近似于魔法的技术
2.2、石鬼面（石之假面）
设定集
夜之一族的天才卡兹制造的面具，可以刺激人类大脑转化为吸血鬼
2.3、艾哲红石

天然的完美红宝石，是极优秀的能量增幅器。与石鬼面结合，可使柱中人进化为究极生物
2.4、究极生物
详细资料
通过艾哲红石增幅能量、石鬼面刺激大脑的柱中人进化而来的究极生物
不再恐惧阳光和波纹，不老不死，不亡不灭，可以自由进化出任何地球生物的身体器官，完美掌控身体
3、波纹气功
波纹最初设定
波纹一族为了击败夜之一族和吸血鬼而创造的技术，通过呼吸大幅增强力量，抵御衰老，产生与太阳光相同的波纹，是人类为了接…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[身为一名替身使者你应该了解的知识
替身，STAND，JOJO系列作品中最核心的设定，也是日本战斗漫画史上的一个独特旗帜
本文将深入整理讨论替身设定，围绕替身体系最基础的『规则』展开
八代JOJO合影以及混入其中的贾一乐
目录

基础设定（来自飙马野郎第十卷）
替身规则与逾矩者
STAND or 幽波纹？
你可以这样成为替身使者
替身的分类

一、基础设定
“无”中生不出“有”来，此乃世人常用的表现句子之一
不过那是“仅止于过去的表现句”
现代物理学已经证实在毫无一物的“无”=“绝对真空”当中……有时会突然产生出名为“素粒子”的超微小粒子[1]
而……“素粒子”能够变化出能量来，也就是说素粒子会突然变成能量，然后突然又凭空消失
刚刚所提到的“素粒子”并不是发生在遥远的宇宙彼端，或仅存于理论当中的事情
而是在这地球的日常生活当中，也随时随地都在发生，相当不足为奇的事情
以上述这些知识为前提，在《JOJO的奇妙冒险》这部作品当中，为求方便，个人便将由人类所引发出来的这股精神能量称之为“替身”
本作品将以绘画（或是影像）来表现这股目不可视的“精神能量”
例如会有这样的表现方式：

在人类或动物的背后，其精神层面将会以经过设计的角色图案浮现出来
此角色（指疯狂钻石）要是以拳头攻击，现实世界的物质就会遭到破坏

有时其精神层面会依附在“刀剑”或“手枪”等武器当中再浮现出来
也有些会附着在“人偶”、“卡片、扑克牌”、“船”、“车”、“锁”、“文字”等道具或日常物品当中。它们都会有所动作，或是进行攻击
（图中为阿努比斯神、性感手枪、黑檀木恶魔、欧里西斯神、力、命运之轮、心锁、天堂之门。对应黑体字）

也有的精神层面是以很小型，数量却很多的形状表现出来
有的会以部分肉体显露出来
（图中为收成者、女皇、迷途猫）
而拥有以心灵看见“替身”的才能之人……称为“替身使者”

一场疫情似乎把所有出境旅行的计划都打破了，但却让我们又一次发现我大中华的锦绣山河，这么的绝美又壮阔；它的云朵不像 瑞士 ，山脉不像阿尔卑斯，它不用模仿任何地方，它有属于自己的名字，它就叫 新疆 巩留 …


【快乐的定格照片】
对于 新疆 的印象是从小时候姥爷给我带回来的红色花帽，色彩浓烈，挂满了漂亮的玻璃珠子~再后来就是跟AJ恋爱后一起去的 喀纳斯 跟 禾木 村，零下40°的冬天，坐雪地摩托他直接把脸冻伤了哈哈哈。
这次来 巩留 就是无意间看到了云杉林，自驾在 新疆 的无界草原可以拥抱最清新的氧气，没有过多的游客，是一片还没沾染凡尘的人间仙境…
忘不了泛着青蓝色湖水的恰甫其海…

忘不了光着脚踩在 库尔 德宁的秘密森林…

忘不了阳光白云下的云杉林...

忘不了下着暴雨，雪山渐渐隐去的恰西山顶…

忘不了 塔里 木途中的原始哈萨克木屋…

忘不了经常拦路的羊咩咩和牧羊人，有时候还有牧羊犬...

我遗忘在那里的记忆太多太多，以至于现在看到某张照片会突然笑起来，阳光天也好，暴雨倾盆也罢，都是旅行画笔下的一抹彩虹。

巩留 ，这是在 伊犁 的一个小县城，但真论起来它也不小，土地面积4528平方千米你感受一下哈哈。静静的坐落在 伊犁 河谷中，于 伊犁 河的上游而生，网上关于它的信息特别少，所以我做足了攻略才决定出发。

【行程】
Day1： 北京 — 伊犁 — 巩留
Day2：恰甫其海— 库尔 德宁
Day3： 塔里 木风景区—恰西风景区
Day4：野核桃沟—蝶湖
Day5： 巩留 — 伊犁 市区— 北京
【交通】
1、 北京 — 伊宁 — 巩留
我是从 北京 出发，首都机场飞 伊宁 （中途会在 克拉玛依 经停），飞行时长6H左右；然后自驾前往 巩留 2H。
2、 上海 / 江苏 —（ 乌鲁木齐 ）— 伊宁 — 巩留
我有小伙伴从 上海 或者 江苏 其他省份最方便的…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。

2021 年 11 月 12 日早上 9:09，还没有把工位的椅子捂热乎，我收到了三周前预定的新 MacBook Pro 14。

这篇文章的主角不是它，但也因它而起。
在这之前，我自己的主力机是 2015 年的 MacBook Pro 13，和一台 15 年组装的 PC ，显卡还是 750 Ti。今年 618 的时候，买了一台明基 PD2705Q 2K 显示器替换掉了原来的 AOC 的某款忘记型号的 1080P 显示器。因为知道下半年 Apple 一定会发布新的 MacBook Pro，所以我在挑选显示器的时候，除了色彩之外最看重的可能就是 Type-C 反向供电功能了，我不太想本来就很小的桌面空间上还有各种各样的线。
但是都 2021 年了，我为什么还要买一台 2K 分辨率的显示器呢？看我当时的主力设备就知道了，老 Mac 加老 PC 组合，我尝试过 4K 显示器，买的是 PHILIPS-279C9，买回来之后发现有一些色偏，背光不均匀以及电脑会卡……于是我就退掉了，换成现在这款，他满足了我对色彩、价格、Type-C 供电等等一切需求，唯有分辨率是硬伤了。
不过 2K 也还好，PC 下没有问题，老 MBP 上也可以开启 HiDPI，并没有感到有很强的颗粒感。对于 Intel 系列的 MacBook Pro 开启 HiDPI 的方式，是按照我派的 这一篇文章 进行设置的。
一切的美好都在我连上了新的 MacBook Pro 之后结束了……
翻车了呀，新电脑到手我才知道 M1 系列芯片无法向原来一样强制开启 HiDPI，而且距 M…]]></summary>

When Marines arrived in Port Everglades for Fleet Week, the local sheriff informed them that there was a true war hero who lived nearby, and that he had a very particular problem the Marines might be able to help him with. 

The man was a Marine aviator who piloted planes in World War Two and had over a hundred combat missions in the Korean War. Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. 

Captain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.]]></summary>

Learning Web in 2021 is not a straight line (Photo by Mark König on Unsplash)
I want to start with the most basic and the important, as well as, sometimes, overlooked part of the Web — HTML. Why overlooked? Thanks to some great JavaScript frameworks, like React, web developers frequently deal with “components” rather than HTML elements. However, it is important to understand semantic HTML and accessibility and many…]]></summary>

A lot of performance issues can be improved using cache, there is a lot of tools out here but for this brief tutorial I'll choose the well-known Nginx.
You can clone the branch nginx-cache or follow this tutorial (I'll only cover the nginx stuff)

I'll use an app from previous post of mine, which calculates the nth fibonacci result given a number. The app it self is very simple and you can see it very small piece of code from the (repository)[https://github.com/iamseki/dev-to] that I mentioned before.

How is a world created? (Worldbuilding)
In Worldbuilding there is two methods of creation, the first is called "top-down", where you create the world's cultures, its inhabitants, civilizations and then the geographic features, it's the option that i will try to avoid, since i want to create the world historically, so from year 0 to year i-dont-know. The other method is the first but inverted, so it's called "bottom-up", where you create the geographic features, such as continents, tectonic plates, biomes and then the cultures, civilizations and more. I will try to use the "bottom-up" method, it's just what i want.

This final part is where we deploy our twitter bot to the Pi, lets go!

This post will cover how basic feedforward neural networks take in a input and produce an output from it. 
Neural networks are a machine learning technique which is loosely inspired by the model of the brain.
As with all machine learning techniques, it learns from a dataset which contains inputs and their corresponding outputs.
Neural networks consist of layers. Each layer is connected to the next layer with weights and biases. These weights and biases are used by the network to calculate the outpu…]]></summary>

Basicamente, o sentry é uma ferramenta que nos auxilia na captura de erros que acontecem nas nossas aplicações em modo debug e também em produção.
é só isso mesmo!!!
Bora ver como isso funciona?

Crie uma conta no sentry


Vai em Criar um projeto e selecione a plataforma ( no nosso caso, REACT NATIVE ) e clica em Criar projeto.





  
  
  Agora no nosso projeto React Native


1 - Instalar a biblioteca de integração do Sentry com o React Native.
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
# or
yarn add @sentry/react-native

2 - Adicionar o Sentry no nosso aplicativo
Você pode adicionar a chamada do sentry no seu app.js ou app.ts da seguinte maneira:
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SUA_DSN_AQUI
});

Sua DSN aparece logo após você criar o seu projeto React Native na plataforma do Sentry
3 - Faça o build da sua aplicação novamente
 yarn android 
 ou
 yarn ios

E pronto, sua aplicação agora está sendo monitorada pelo sentry, e qualquer erro ele vai te mostrar em uma dashboard da plataforma.
Você também consegue ver algumas métricas do dispositivo do usuário, como:
Nível de bateria, network que estava sendo utilizada no momento do crash, IP e etc...
É isso galera, qualquer dúvida deixe nos comentários :D]]></summary>

Here is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I’ve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own — and though I’m not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??

Also, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron & I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!

This video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea & Megan for letting us film at your store!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
We will create a simple white-board with a web-socket.
The white-board is just an empty screen to draw lines.
We need an SVG to draw lines and a web-socket to keep shearing the image.
Let’s get it started.
First we need to create the client side.
To use a web-socket we need to create a WebSocket object.
To get data from the server we need to subscribe to the message events.
To send data use the “send” method.
To draw a line we press the left mouse button at the start of a line and release at the end.
In the mouse up event handler we create a string from a template.
Now we need the server.
Create a new WebSocketObject.
To start the server open the folder and type “node index.js”.
Let’s check it out.
Thank you for watching to the end. 
script.js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
const svg = document.getElementById('svg');
const path = document.getElementById('path');
let e0;

socket.addEventListener('message', e => {
   path.setAttributeNS(null, 'd', `${e.data}`);
});

svg.addEventListener('mousedown', e => e0 = e);

svg.addEventListener('mouseup', e => {
   socket.send(`M ${e0.offsetX} ${e0.offsetY} L ${e.offsetX} ${e.offsetY}`);
});

index.js
import {WebSocketServer} from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});
const connections = [];
let d = '';

wss.on('connection', ws => {
    connections.push(ws);
    ws.on('message', onMessage);
    ws.send(d, {binary: false});
});

const onMessage = data => {
    d += data;
    connections.forEach(ws => ws.send(d, {binary: false}));
};

NoteCircle：把你想做的事装进一个地方

平台：iOS / iPadOS
关键词：任务管理、待办清单、提醒事项

@Vanilla：又是待办事项 App？我相信很多人看到这一类 App 已经开始出现天然的抗拒感，一方面是因为待办事项 App 已经多如牛毛，另一方面是大多数人已经破除了对这一类工具的迷信。就算真的需要待办事项工具，绝大部分人的需求都可以在任意一个简单的工具上实现，所以选择时的痛点已经转化成了平台选择和设计选择，换句话说就是选一个好看的、能用的就行。今天要介绍的 NoteCircle 就是一个设计别致以及勉强能用的待办事项 App。
NoteCircle 借鉴了纸质笔记本的设计，通过标签将主要功能分为了 Todo、Routine、Event、Checklist 四大部分。
Todo 就是待办事项，添加时只能设置名称、时间和日期、提醒等简单的选项，操作时也只能勾选完成或者取消勾选两个动作，没有其它的手势操作。如果需要对待办事项重新排序，需要点击右上角的排序按钮进入相应的界面，通过拖动来将它们放到我想要的位置。在 Todo 模块还有一个每周目标的功能，创建后会可以固定在 Todo 界面的顶部，然后将 To…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为题主问题中截图人之一（李靓莉），我必须要来答一下。
我们所谓“喝汤没营养”是有前提的，也从没有否认祖国美食博大精深。广东人煲汤我也很爱喝啊！也不是站在“对立面”而是区分优先级~
就来说说我主要说的：婴幼儿群体。为什么说对婴幼儿来说，喝汤没营养？
一、为什么不推荐孩子喝汤？
1、孩子胃容量很有限，汤的营养密度太低
孩子的口味太小了，所以要把有限的胃容量给到对生长发育更重要的食物。比如奶、富含蛋白质的动物性食物，以及可以有效快速供能的主食类。
所以我们会提倡给孩子优先提供“高营养密度”的食物。尤其是一些生长发育不是很好，体重增加比较缓慢的宝宝，我们会说，能吃干的就别吃水的。也就是说，能吃饭的别喝粥，能吃固体的，就别吃流质。也就是这个道理，同等的体积下，让孩子可以摄入更多的能量和营养物质。帮助孩子的生长发育。
2、汤真的没那么重要
对一岁内的孩子来说，优先保证奶量是最重要的。在此基础上是动物性食物，主食。蔬菜水果对一岁内的孩子来说，如果胃口有限，都不是必需的，更别提汤了。


二、汤有营养吗？
有，水分居多。
很多人会觉得汤有营养，尤其是白白的一层。这其实也是我们长久以来的误区。比如白色的骨汤汤，联想到了白色的骨头，喝白色的骨头汤=能补钙=长骨头、长高。
骨头汤是熬制猪骨后的汤水，汤水颜色发白，味道浓郁（我承认是蛮好喝的… ）。骨头虽然是富含钙的食材，可并不代表骨头熬汤可以把骨头里的钙给析出。
骨头汤在熬制的时候，被析出的只有骨头里的骨髓，其中就含有大量的脂肪。
经过高温反复滚煮后就变成了奶白色，而浓郁的味道同样是脂肪带来的（想想全脂奶 vs 脱脂奶）。
除了脂肪被大量析出，会有极少量的蛋白质和微量元素也会被析出。
至于钙？
除非你把猪骨嚼碎了吃下去（恐怕也是吸收不了的呢）。
和骨头汤类似被认为特别有营养的汤还有鱼汤、小排汤和鸡汤。对于这些荤汤，如果你只喝汤水不吃肉，那同样是在喝一锅富含脂肪的汤水。
哺乳期的妈妈如果喝多了，还会增加堵奶风险！

三、那不能喝汤了吗？
当然不是。
汤虽然不是宝宝每餐要有的食物，但如果可以保证奶量的基础上，并且每餐的完成度也不错。其实根据家庭的饮食习惯还是可以喝的。
一岁以下的宝宝：
不要经常喝。由于肠胃功能不完善，经常喝汤是不可取的。本不大的胃喝汤之后，也会影响其他食物的摄入。并且在辅食添加的初期，喝汤无法锻炼孩子的咀嚼能力。
至于一岁以上的宝宝：
适当增加。保证其他食物摄入的前提下，在平时的饮食中增加一些汤羹类食物，也是丰富孩子餐桌形式的方式。
当然，喝汤更要吃汤里的东西。相比很稀的汤，我更推荐浓稠一些的类型。
【宝宝罗宋汤】

罗宋汤是一道经典的汤羹。酸酸甜甜的底味能够很大的勾起孩子的食欲，让人大开胃口。这道汤中除了番茄酱（可自制番茄酱）不可替换外，其余食材都是可以自由变换的哦～无添加的番茄酱品牌：「笑厨」、「西域日记」供参考。


【丝瓜鳕鱼蛋花汤】
鳕鱼不仅可以蒸和煎，还能放在汤里噢。总体的食材搭配均衡，完成度也很棒，这汤当然可以喝。



好啦，今天就到这里！
总之，我们不是站在“对立面”而是区分优先级~~

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[食了冬至圆
就长大一岁啦
今天是冬至，今年的最后一个节气。说起冬至，你会想起什么画面呢？
杜甫说：“云物不殊乡国异，教儿且覆掌中杯”；汪曾祺写：“家人闲坐，灯火可亲”。这一年中最漫长的黑夜，要回到家里，跟亲人一起度过。

南方的冬至，湿冷气直往骨子里钻，暮色更显沉重，所以大人早早下班，小孩早早放学，关门闭窗，万家灯火通明。是团聚，给予人们抵御“至暗时刻”的勇气。
虽然是最深的黑夜，却也是转折之时。过了冬至，日头渐长，春意从此萌动。可能正是因为这特殊时刻的特殊触感，南方人十分重视这一天，“冬至大如年”呀，晚上一起搓圆子，早上醒来还要拜祭祖先神灵。





在南方人眼里，冬至还能预测未来的气候。最有趣的是南京人这句谚语：“邋遢冬至干净年，干净冬至邋遢年”，不是指人的穿着，而是说冬至晴好，则过年有雨雪，反之亦然。今年你们那儿的冬至，又是什么天气呢？
因为重视，所以南方的冬至风味也格外丰富。当大部分北方人依然用一盘饺子问候冬至时，南方各地，家家户户的门窗里，飘出的是五花八门的冬至味道——





带馅的、不带馅的，甜的、咸的，大的、小的汤圆，每一颗都是团团圆圆的希冀；广东的糯米团子，浙江的年糕、糯米饭同样寓意满满；苏州人在饮冬酿酒，全年只此一杯；湖南、江西人在吃熏腊肉，烟熏风味此刻最美；四川人独爱一碗热气腾腾的羊汤，广东人架起一桌好菜，鸡鸭鱼肉应有尽有。





冷风中熬过冬至，不需要靠一身正气，家人在身旁，热汤热菜在嘴边，总有一味温暖人心。


不只是汤圆
南方到底有多少种“团子”？
“家家捣米做汤圆，知是明朝冬至天”，搓圆子吃汤圆，南方冬至夜的第一要事。不只是汤圆，很多地方吃的糯米团子，也是冬至常客，所以这句诗还有另一种说法：“家家捣米做米团，定是明日冬至节”。





浙江朋友告诉我，南方团子的差异大得离谱，尤其是加上方言之后：浙南地区的人叫冬至圆，潮汕地区的人叫冬节…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[怒花近4万检测费，测了15款鸭血，用实测结果告诉你：咱们吃的鸭血，到底是真是假。


前段时间测了真假羊肉串后，后台一直有朋友问：魏老爸，听说鸭血也有假的，还有的会加胶水！顺道儿给测测呗？



鸭血有假，这事儿确实不假，前几个月还有监管部门曝出：某知名火锅店用了假鸭血。



身边也有同事作证，他老家的环境不适宜养鸭子，当地也不兴吃鸭子。
据他的圈内好友说，当地吃的鸭血，九成九都是假的。



正好这天气冷了，火锅里的各种食材确实得安排上了，ok，那咱就给大家来测一测！ 
我们在各大买菜平台、菜市场、知名火锅店、楼下麻辣烫店等各个渠道购买了14份鸭血。



还专门拜托开头的同事，代购了他家当地卖的鸭血。



最后，集齐了15款鸭血，然后送去实验室，检测了它们的“真实身份”。
全家福如下：

样品费1069.23 元 +检测费38240元 =合计39309.23元
这些鸭血到底是真是假？鸭血里面真的会加胶水吗？还能不能愉快地涮火锅了？
我们一起往下看结果。

一、我们吃的鸭血，到底是真是假？
假鸭血一般都是用牛血、猪血冒充的，原因很简单，它们个头大、血量多，价格自然就低了。
之前某明星的火锅店爆雷，就是因为被曝出用了牛血冒充鸭血。
也有一些黑作坊，会用鸡血来冒充鸭血。



所以我们这次把15款鸭血的猪、牛、鸡、鸭四种源性全部测了一遍。



结果让人大吃一惊：16款鸭血，居然有15款都是真的。
连同事代购的不养鸭子、不吃鸭子的家乡当地鸭血，都是真的。（心在滴血，钱包在流泪！！！）

只有2号鸭血检出了鸡血成分：



 结果翻出存样后，我不禁陷入了沉思......原来人家早就“老实交代”了，早早就在配料表中标出了【鸡血】成分。



我们拆开这份鸭·鸡血，和普通鸭血做了对比，发现他们的颜色、质地几乎没啥差别，看来光从外观上是很难区分了。

建议大家在买鸭血时，还是得多…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows 8 及 Windows Phone 时代微软引入了应用商店，彼时在部分 Windows 版本中应用商店更是唯一安装应用的途径。不过微软显然高估了自己在开发者当中的号召力，商店中应用寥寥。之后微软给出了传统应用转制商店应用的解决方案换来了些许生机，但从来没打开过 Microsoft Store 的 Windows 用户至今不在少数。
今年 6 月，微软终于放下了执念，宣布 推出一个更加开放，有着更多 App 的应用商店：接受采用各种 API、各类打包方式的应用，商店的抽成也大幅度降低。在这之后，每隔一段时间就有某些知名的 App 上架 Microsoft Store 的新闻。现在的 Microsoft Store 或许终于能满足用户绝大多数应用的下载需求了。
本文就带大家概览目前在 Microsoft Store 上架的那些优秀应用。知名应用会几句话带过，若少数派有相关文章本文也会一并附上，算是带领大家做一个回顾。
部分应用可能需要将Windows 区域设置为其他国家或地区（比如美国）才能检索到。
为什么选择 Microsoft Store
我想每一个 Windows 用户都希望有一个官方的安全便利的应用下载途径，正如业务主管 Panos Panay 在 谈及 Microsoft Store 时所说：

我非常憧憬这样一种体验：打开商店，键入 App 的名字，然后你就能下载到想要的 App。

犹记得刚刚接触 Windows，我会在搜索引擎中检索应用名，蠢蠢地点击下载站提供的「高速下载」按钮，双击下载的文件后，弹出的不是应用安装向导，而是默认勾选名字炫酷的游戏和安全卫士的 xx 高速下载器。直到今天，各类下载站仍然盘踞在搜索结果的前列。

相较于下载站，使用由微软提供的应用商店显然更让人放心。而相较于四处寻找官网或者软件包管理器，在 Microsoft Sto…]]></summary>

但在黑河，我能一眼望到俄罗斯~

我们是怎么做到一脚跨两国咧~
行程： 
DAY1：五大连池—温泊—北引泉 
DAY2：瑷珲汽车越野赛—瑷珲条约纪念馆—瑷珲知青馆 
DAY3：四嘉子满族乡“颁金节”—关东民俗村 
DAY4：俄罗斯布拉戈维申斯克市
（ps：我是2018年末的时候去的，现在想去的小伙伴一定要问清楚当地的防疫政策呀~）





从北京出发，乘飞机到哈尔滨机场，原计划直接从哈尔滨继续飞五大连池，但航司临时变动，下午的飞机被调到早晨，所以只能取消。所以我们直接从哈尔滨开车到五大连池，大概3个多小时~



高中地理老师说的五大连池
高中地理老师天天念叨的五大连池，这次终于见了第一面~它并不是单指五湖池水，而是一大片区域。大概在1719年-1721年间，火山喷发阻塞河道，形成五个相互连接的湖泊，所以叫五大连池。









就在我们去的温泊，大概零下20度+，遇到超好看的雾凇、冰挂，再加上8°+的温泊水，真真有种童话世界的感觉。







中间有出树上因为冰雪积压成了冰挂，刚刚好弯成一圈~逆光的时候透过晶莹剔透的冰挂折射出超美的冰挂。Emmm，有一瞬间觉得自己是仙境里的小仙女哈哈~



50公分厚结冰上的冬捕
每年冬天黑河这边都会有冬捕，最重要的是人们从四面八方赶来，趁着捕鱼时节图个好彩头。



捕鱼前的传统仪式很有喜庆的味道，锣鼓声天和冰上的民族舞，都颇有一番民俗的风味~









我估计附近的、旅行的人都来凑热闹了，人群太大，我真的挤不进去哈哈哈，透着人缝看到渔民正在收网，据说冬捕的头鱼能被拍卖到8888哈哈，真假不知道，但大家图个头彩的乐子我倒是领教了~

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[究竟使用什么样的器材或者什么样的器材才算足够好得拍好照片，是一直困扰着很多人的问题。机缘巧合之下，我拿到了一台来自于十六年前的相机：佳能的 EOS 350d。它诞生于 2005 年，机身和镜头总重量为 500 克，拥有一块 800 万像素的传感器，7 点对焦系统，搭配的是一支 18mm-55mm 的镜头，采用 cf 卡进行记录，有一块 1.8 英寸的屏幕。
无论是多么宽容的人，都会承认这是一台性能全方面落伍的相机。我拿到手的时候，简单检查了一下，发现右手握持部分的胶皮已经没有了，储存卡的弹窗已经没有了弹力，镜头上全是手指印，甚至镜头盖也没有了。这进一步让我对这台相机的成像素质不敢抱有什么期望。
可以说是相当的 old fashion 了
因为工作关系，我需要用它来拍摄一些报道的图片。于是我突发奇想，为什么不看看我把这台相机一整天都带在身边会拍出什么样的图片呢？于是乎，一整个周六我都一直把它带着，用完两块电池，也拍了不少照片。这里，我邀请大家和这台十六岁的相机一起陪我度过一个普通的周六。在放出图片的同时，我也会把当时图片拍摄前的想法一起分享出来，也复盘一下当时拍摄的心境。
前期准备
毕竟这是一台上了年纪的相机，所以在拍摄方面也不能够按照现在相机的标准去苛求它的表现。因为这台相机只有 7 个对焦点，往往只有中间的对焦点才采用对焦比较精准的十字对焦点，所以我在拍摄的时候一般采用中心对焦点对焦然后重新构图的方式进行对焦。
在拍摄模式方面，主要采用 a 档（光圈优先）和 p 档（程序优先）进行拍摄。同时，本机没有自动 ISO 功能，所以我只能手动调整，在白天的时候感光度定在 100 或者 400 ，晚上或者室内的时候感光度定在800（最高感光度是 1600 ）。
8:00 AM 赶路和车站
如果需要在赶路的时候拍照，拍到是最重要的。这个时候我一般把感光度设置成 400，采用程序优先模…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[各位许久不见，我是片冈智！
有关《水仙》的（实拍）电影化，这里也稍稍写下我个人的感想。


事实上至今为止，无论是日本还是美国的制片商，都曾有过电影化的提案。
而最终拒绝的理由，虽然有好几个……但其中最重要的，则是故事最后“让濑津美的病治好了”的结局设计吧。
有关最后（濑津美）走向大海的情节，如果是将其做暧昧处理的话倒还可行，然而“治好病了真好呢！”这种“廉价的结局”却是难以容许的。
我想做出这种结局设计的理由可能有“更讨喜观众”或者其他商业上的考虑……但对于那些只会想着“人死了就是悲剧！就是坏结局（Bad End）！”的人，恐怕《水仙》原本就不会是他们能理解的作品吧。


有关这点，本次负责电影化的导演则是纯粹地喜欢着《水仙》，对于何为《水仙》的“核心”也很能理解，我也十分放心。
哪怕有设定上的变更，只要“核心”不变的话就没问题。


反之，仅仅只有设定或者表面上的故事情节依循原作，结局却魔改成“病治好了！幸福结局！”的话可太糟糕了＞＜
如果不那么做就没法受观众欢迎、商业角度很难成功的话，那还不如别电影化了。


如果不那么做就很难找到赞助商的话，那还不如用更低的预算、花上更多的时间去“自由”地创作要来得更好。
而我自己也会竭尽全力协助的。


我想作为（权利）签约方的sekai project，也是能同意这种做法的。
毕竟对于过去我很少同意Nekoneko Soft作品动画化的理由，他们也是知情的。


简而言之，对于《水仙》电影化这件事，某种程度上还请大家放心！
作为原作者来说我信任着本次企划的导演，而事先做剧本监修的时候，要是有实在不行的内容我也会提出意见。


再说一个很现实的情况，这次电影化我自己是拿不到一分钱的w
但之所以仍然要做，既是作为原作者的自尊、也是为了尽到对喜欢本作的朋友们的义务。





お久しぶり、片岡ともです！
ナルキ映画化について、少し長いけど書いてみますね！
実は今までにも、日本とアメリカからも映画化のオファーがありました。
断った理由は幾つかありますが……
ラストシーンで「セツミの病気が治る」エンディングを希望されたのが大きいです。
ラストで海に入るシーンを、曖昧にするくらいならＯＫですが、
病気が治って良かった！な「安易なエンディング」は許容できません。
恐らく「観客ウケ」や商業的なことも考えた上でのことかも知れませんが……
そもそも人が死ぬ＝悲劇だ！　バッドエンドだ！としか思えない方に、
理解できるような作品なのでしょうか？　ナルキは？

それに対して今回の監督さんは、純粋にナルキ好きの方だと思っています。
何がナルキの「芯」であるか？を理解している方なら、自分は安心しています。
幾つかの変更点があったとしても「芯」がブレなければ。
逆に、設定・表層の出来事だけ原作通りだったとしても、
ラストで病気が治った！ハッピーエンド！とかダメすぎ＞＜
そうしないと観客ウケ・商業的に厳しいなら、映画化しない方が良い。
そうしないとスポンサーが付かないのなら、低予算で何年かかっても「自由」に作って貰える方がうれしいです。
自分も出来る限り協力しますし。
たぶん契約元のsekai projectさんも、それでＯＫと言うはずです。
自分がねこねこ作品のアニメ化も、滅多に許可しないことを、よくご存じですし。

そんなわけでナルキ映画化については、ある程度ご安心下さいませ！
自分としては監督を信頼していますし、
事前の脚本チェックでダメすぎる場合は、自分も意見すると思います。
あと、ぶっちゃけですが、映画化しても自分には１円もお金は入って来ませんよw
でもこれは作者としてのプライドと、作品を気に入ってくれた方への義務だと考えています。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[虽然大家总在吐槽微信的各种不方便，但无论是工作、学习还是生活，我们总是难以完全摆脱它。最近，微信推出了网页版「文件传输助手」，允许用户在不登陆电脑客户端的情况下，实现手机和电脑的文件互传。
编注：经测试，WeChat（微信海外版）用户可能无法登录网页版「文件传输助手」，建议使用微信国内版账户登录。
怎么用，好用吗？
在浏览器中打开 https://filehelper.weixin.qq.com/ 并扫码登录即可使用网页版文件传输助手，登录之后会显示如下图的对话框。与客户端的「文件传输助手」一样，你只需要输入文字、拖动文件就能在电脑和手机之间相互传输，几乎没有上手门槛。

在使用体验上，网页版「文件传输助手」与客户端差别不大。不过网页版有一个优势在于不会占用登录名额。微信在此前推出了多端登录功能，但实际上只支持「手机 + 平板 + 电脑」各一台，用户不能登录两台同一类别的设备（比如同时登录两台电脑，先登录的那一端就会强制下线）。
网页版「文件传输助手」则不会占用这个登录名额，你可以通过网页版文件传输助手来实现多端同时在线。如果在网页端上传了一份文件，其他所有客户端都会显示传输了该文件。
除了不占用登录名额外，网页版「文件传输助手」还有两个优势：

泛用性：只要有浏览器就可以使用。在大学教室等公共场合，不需要为了传输文件而单独安装一个微信客户端。
私密性：不知道你有没有遇到过，在公共场合登录微信，结果聊天记录被同步过去而导致的「社死」现场。而网页版「文件传输助手」只能用于文件传输，并不同步联系人信息、聊天记录，在公共场合使用时能够保护你的隐私数据不被他人看到。

可以传多大的文件？
与客户端相同，网页版「微信传输助手」支持传输最大 1GB 的文件。但如果所传输的是一个大文件，需要在客户端进行点击「接收文件」才会开始下载。这一点需要特别注意，避免发生文件传输了，但是在需要用的时候发现还没下载，甚至已经过期的尴尬情况。
当文件从网页版微信上传之后，除了可以「接受文件」下载之外，还可以在不下载的情况下，直接一键将文件转发给需要的联系人。点进文件详情页面，点击下方的「发送给朋友」即可直接选择好友发送。
也就是说，如果你想通过微信将某个电脑文件发给微信好友，你可以通过网页版「文件传输助手」将它发送给自己，随后直接转发给对方，省去了下载的麻烦。

总结
在一定程度上，网页版「文件传输助手」很好地解决了在公共场合、他人电脑上传输文件所带来的不便和尴尬。而且，当你关闭「文件传输助手」窗口后，原本的传输记录也会一并消失。既可以达到传输文件的目的，又可以避免了个人隐私的泄漏。
总的来说，网页版「文件传输助手」算是解决了微信跨平台传输文件的痛点。再加上它的低门槛和隐私性，以后去打印店打印东西，或者在公共场合的电脑上传文件再也不用担心变「社死」现场了。

韦伯望远镜发射升空，将观测宇宙初期状态
美国东部时间 12 月 25 日上午 7 点 20 分，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜（James Webb Space Telescope, JWST）在经过多次延期后，在法属圭亚那航天中心由阿丽亚娜五号火箭运载升空。接下来，韦伯空间望远镜还需要滑行约一个月、顺利进入预定轨道后方可开展观测工作。
韦伯空间望远镜是哈勃太空望远镜和斯皮策空间望远镜的后继计划。但与绕近地轨道公转的哈勃望远镜不同，韦伯望远镜放置于遥远的第二拉格朗日点，将在距地球 150 万公里处绕太阳轨道运行。
韦伯空间望远镜主要的任务是调查大爆炸理论的残余红外线证据（宇宙微波背景辐射），即观测今天可见宇宙的初期状态。为此，它拥有一个总直径 6.5 米，被分割成 18 面镜片的主镜，面积为哈勃空间望远镜的5倍以上；此外，附带了高灵敏度红外电传感器、光谱器、可折叠遮光板等。
韦伯望远镜的最早发射日期定在 2007 年，预算为 5 亿美元，而如今实际花费已经超过百亿美元，是国际空间站之后最昂贵的太空设施项目。来源

荷兰监管机构要求 Apple 允许约会类应用使用第三方支付系统处理内购
荷兰消费者和市场管理局于 12 月 24 日发布了一项最新的裁决，要求 Apple 必须允许「约会类」应用（如 Tinder）使用非 Apple 的支付系统处理内购。如果 Apple 在 2022 年 1 月 15 日之前未能执行该裁决，则将会面临巨额的罚款，罚款金额最高可达 5000 万欧元。这项新裁决不适用其他应用类别，例如游戏类以及其他应用类的内购。
对此，Apple 表示不会认可这项裁决，并已经提起上诉。此前，在美国与 Epic 的诉讼案中，法院支持了 Epic 关于开放第三方支付的诉求，但该判决在 Apple 提交上诉后被上诉法院暂缓执行。来源

Hello, and welcome to my awesome blog! 😊
This blog is part 1, of my under 90 min YouTube tutorial where I am going to show you how you can copy the disney.com landing page only using vanilla html and css. This project also focuses heavily on flexbox, so if you want to get some practice with that then this is the perfect tutorial!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUBhdvK31A 
In this first part, I'm showing you how to set up the html, and the styling for the mobile version of the website. In the second part I am going to show you how to make the page fully responsive and look good on desktop.
I have made a git repository that you can clone to follow along the tutorial (which I recommend)

Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.
I'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch). I started this project to get some practice with css flexbox.
By the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself and making tutorials on my 
YouTube-channel .
It would be awesome if you would follow along me on my journey and learn with me. You can follow my  blog  and subscribe to my  YouTube channel. And if you liked the YouTube video then it would really make my day if you left a comment or liked this post.

Keep Coding.]]></summary>

OSI stands for Open System Interconnection, it’s a conceptual framework for how application communicate over a network. The purpose of the OSI model is to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software. OSI has a stack of seven layers within the model and the layers are used to help user identify what is happening within a networking system.
What is OSI layer?


The OSI layer are typically described from the top layer down. With the help of layering we decompose the problem of building a network into manageable components (layers), these layers help with modular design and easy troubleshooting. Going down and up the stack is called encapsulating and decapsulating respectfully. The layers are:

The number of views is a number value that is held against each post on my WordPress site using what is known as post meta. Post meta is a mechanism that WordPress provides that will let you store some additional data with each post and is normally set behind the scenes for you by custom PHP code running in either a theme or a plugin.
In my case I have set up a filter inside my functions.php file to increment a post views value by 1 each time a request is made to retrieve data for a specific post via the Rest API.

One of the important things in creating a REST API is the validation of data coming from the frontend. That is, whenever our APIs are subject to receiving data from the request body (for example) it is always good to ensure that we are receiving the necessary properties and that the data types are correct.
And in golang we have some libraries that help us with this purpose and in this article we are going to use the validator library, which besides being perhaps the most popular, is the one that contains a good number of resources for us to learn on the internet.
In today's example we'll create a simple API, but then we'll proceed with implementing a middleware to validate the data before proceeding to the next handler.
First let's install the following dependencies:

How cool would it be if you could just call a mint function, give the token's metadata as an argument, and it mints an NFT for you? All without writing a single line of Solidity code. Let's see if that's possible.

With revolutionary technology, Webb will observe a part of space and time never seen before, providing a wealth of amazing views into an era when the very first stars and galaxies formed––over 13.5 billion years ago.

It can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and study the atmospheres of distant worlds. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more! It’s the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built.

Webb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make Webb a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries!

The performance took place in The Chapter House inside Westminster Abbey in December 2021. The song was played as part of the Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, a carol service that reflected upon the difficult past 18 months for people across our nation, and particularly for those who might be more vulnerable, isolated or have limited access to support.

#TogetherAtChristmas was a moment to recognise those who have struggled during the pandemic, as well as to celebrate the individuals and organisations who carried out inspirational acts of kindness and incredible feats to help those in need in our communities.

本文为《付费内容年度精选·2021》免费试读文章。《付费内容年度精选·2021》以超低的价格，精选了多篇会员、付费栏目和工具升值包等少数派出品的付费内容。本篇选自少数派会员第 12 期。

这是一篇超过一万字的、内容严肃且枯燥的注意力报告，请先评估你此刻的环境和时间安排是否允许你认真阅读。
如果当下不能阅读，请打开你的 To-do 工具，将「阅读本文」放进收件箱，并即刻标记一个你认为适合阅读的时间。记得把文章链接也插入 To-do，便于任务提醒时你能第一时间点击链接，进入本文。
请在阅读前给自己一个提示：我想一口气读完这篇文章。
关闭其它一切窗口，只保留本文的浏览器介面，开启全屏模式。
找个安静或者你认为舒适的环境，开始阅读。

专注力是一个我很想在《少数派报告》里分享的话题。作为一名 ADHD 患者，我一直都饱受注意力缺失的困扰，尤其在近两年工作压力增大之后，我甚至已经察觉到自己出现了阅读障碍。
在研究和治疗 ADHD 的过程中，我也或主动或被动地了解和掌握了大量关于注意力的知识，并且积累了一些实践经验。当下，人类对于人脑的研究整体还处于较为初级的阶段，市面上关于注意力的图书和文献中的内容也或深或浅，各有说辞，没有绝对的定论。因此，在筹划本文的过程中，我的核心目标就是在尽可能不涉及专业术语和晦涩理论的前提下，清楚地将注意力的原理和概念阐释出来，带你以更简单的方式了解注意力的特点和由来。
在这篇《注意力使用不完全报告》中，我会从注意力的基本概念出发，最终延伸到有效提升专注力的办法，希望可以帮你在学习和工作中提升状态，提高效率，减少失误。
需要注意的是，文中的重点会集中在探讨注意力的底层原理，读起来可能会有些吃力。不要着急，放慢阅读速度。在理解了专注力从哪里来、到哪里去之后，相信你也能结合自身工作和学习环境，创造属于自己的专注力保持体系。
我们开始吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

当游船行驶到湖中，很容易就会想起梭罗在《瓦尔登湖》里写下的那句「天空跃于头顶，而又俯于足下」。
阳澄湖
若换成更具本土特色的说法，那就是「落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色」。
所剩无几的江南水乡
阳澄湖的一潭湖水上承自古太湖水系的支脉，在江南风景里已涌动了数千年。湖水清澈，碧波荡漾。大闸蟹是这里享誉天下的特产，初秋季节的头等珍馐佳肴。每年金九银十，浩浩荡荡的顺丰冷链车就从上海和苏州市区驶来，驶过美人腿、莲花岛半岛，将蟹农们饲养一年的宝贝收集装箱，发往全国各地。肥美的蟹挥舞着蟹钳落入滚烫的蒸锅沸水里，捞起时飘香在空中的已是满屋蟹黄蟹膏的味道。
名满天下的阳澄湖大闸蟹
但可惜的是，世人只知名誉在外的大闸蟹，却忽视了阳澄湖本身的美。《沙家浜》有汪曾祺的名句：「朝霞映在阳澄湖上，芦花放稻谷香岸柳成行」。如今从阳澄湖上向四围望去，除了比人高的芦荡、临湖而立的大树，此岸与彼岸的土地上也多出了连绵成片的城市楼宇，苏州市区和昆山在这里拱湖相望。疏影横斜间，留下的是城市化进程中所剩无几的江南水乡。
现代水乡
本期游记，是我数次往返阳澄湖后的经验总结，希望能向你展示出一篇详尽的吃蟹指南，以及一幅不仅限于大闸蟹的阳澄湖的样貌。当然，作为一个没有那么标准化商业化的景点，阳澄湖并没有标准游玩路线，更不需要按点打卡。一个简单的周末，肆意地漫游，便是最适合阳澄湖的打开方式，也是我最推崇的旅行心态。散步在稻谷田野里，心情便像宁静的湖水一样，在日光云影下缓缓舒展开来。
岛上漫游·路线图
游玩阳澄湖的线路很多…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building an application can be hard depending on how you do it, as our career passes and the knowledge we get, more information and good practices we use for creating and improving the software we maintain.
Some good practices are in SOLID Principles, a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
Is good to be clear, SOLID has been created with Object-Oriented Programming in mind, so we are adapting to Elixir, a functional programming language, we are going to see that the benefits do not depend on the programming paradigm.

To explain better how we use the solid principles on elixir, I am gonna create a module and for each principle, we refactor it, the module is called Animals and is responsible to create …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we know, there are no conditional statements in CSS, but this may soon change with new @when and @else operator
Currently, the only way to perform a conditional statement was to use media queries like this:
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  /* ... */ 
}
@media (max-width: 599px) {
  /* ... */
}

It works perfectly, but in the new proposal it looks much cleaner and very similar to many programming languages.
@when media(min-width: 600px) {
  /* ... */ 
}
@else {
  /* ... */ 
}

We can do multiple conditions as well by using multiple @else statements, and not just use @media, but @supports too.
@when media(width >= 600px) and media(pointer: fine) and supports(display: grid) {
  /* A */
} @else supports(caret-color: red) and supports(background: double-rainbow()) {
  /* B */
} @else {
  /* C */
}

There may be questions about the naming of this new feature. Some people think that @if would be a better name than @when, the reason behind this naming is probably that Sass already uses @if, and it would be annoying to many developers if they had to refactor their Sass logic.
The bad news is that it's not supported by any browser at this moment, it's not even listed on caniuse.com.
What do you think about this new proposal?]]></summary>

Pointers are used all over in C and C++, and a critical part of using them safely is to understand how long a pointer will be valid.  Getting this wrong results in use-after-free bugs or memory leaks, both of which plague C/C++ programs.
C++ offers some tools to do this kind of thing automatically -- smart pointers, RAII, and so on.  But in C, the language is generally no help, and it's up to the programmer to understand the situation.  This is generally handled with long, explicit comm…]]></summary>

One issue with covering Logo is that it's meant for interactive use in some Logo GUI environment, and these are platform specific and don't last very long, so every variant of Logo will be quite different. And it's not just their fancy features like 3D graphics, interactivity, and so on. Even very basic commands like like changing color are going to be different in each Logo.
I'll be using in-browser papert Logo, so all examples will work in papers. Different Logo implementations will need some adjustments. I'll try to mention when something is implementation-specific…]]></summary>

Letra:
[Verso 1]
Yo sé que soy un c@brón
Que no merezco tu perdón
Te juro que no e' mi intención
Pero si escucha' esta canción

[Coro]
Te deseo lo mejor
Ojalá que te olvides de mí-í-í-í-í
Yo sé que fui lo peor
Y tú mereces ser feli'-i'-i'-i'
Me voy antes de que sea tarde
Y el corazón te destroce otra ve'
Ya sé que soy un cobarde
Si quiere' haz quе no me conoce', está biеn

[Verso 2]
Otra ve' no cumplí lo que te prometí
Otra ve' te fallé, otra ve' te mentí, eh-eh
Otra ve' me toca ser el malo
¿De qué valen la' flore' y lo' regalo'?
Si soy culpable de tu dolor
Y por mí ahora ere' peor
No quiere' que más nadie te hable de amor
Pero yo—

[Coro]
Te deseo lo mejor
Ojalá que te olvides de mí-í-í-í-í
Yo sé que fui lo peor
Y tú mereces ser feli'-i'-i'-i'
Me voy ante' de que sea tarde
Y el corazón te destroce otra ve'
Ya sé que soy un cobarde
Si quiere' haz que no me conoce', está bien, eh

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometime in JavaScript we need a function that executes only once and never again. Basically a function that disappears right after its called once. How can we achieve this? for example we could do this:
const func1 = function(){
             console.log('this function will never run again!`)
                }
 func1();

But we definitely can call this func1() again if we want. This is NOT what we want to do. We want to execute a function immediately without having to save it somewhere.
function(){
console.log('This function will never run again')
}

if we run this, we would get an error function statements require a function name an that's because JavaScript expects a function statement, but we simply start a new line of code with the function keyword.
Here we can still trick JavaScript into thinking that this is just an expression. We do that by simply wrapping all of this into GROUPING OPERATOR().
(function(){
   console.log('This is will never run again!')
});

so we basically transform the previous statement into an expression. But the function didn't execute yet. To execute the function we need to call it like this (adding '()' next to it, like we do with regular function call).
(function(){
   console.log('This is will never run again!')
})();

So we create a function expression and we immediately call it. which is why this pattern is called Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE).
The same would also work for an arrow function this way.
(() => console.log('This function will never run again!'))();

This will also never run again.
so this is not really a feature, of the JavaScript.
it's more of a pattern, that some developers come up with and it is widely used.
This design pattern is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.
Self-Executing -> it executes the moment it is created.
Anonymous -> it has no name and is not stored variable.]]></summary>

@Kostya：Nanoleaf Essentials 灯带

购买渠道：Apple Store 在线商店
价格：338 元 （近期 Nanoleaf 天猫期舰店的价格比较好）

目前在 Apple Store 在线商店的 HomeKit 配件，可谓是少之又少。本来，HomeKit 配件就以高价格让人望而却步，加上大部分智能家居配件又只能工作在 2.4GHz 的 Wi-Fi 网络下，我一直都对智能家居有那么一些抗拒。只不过，最近正好一个人搬到了出租屋，公寓里面的照明不仅单调，而且开关也比较死板，就种草了 Nanoleaf 的 Shapes 六角灯和 Essentials 灯带。正值年末，我也狠下心来，买了这两款灯具。上一篇「新玩意」，我已经介绍了 Nanoleaf Shapes 六角灯奇光板，这篇就来说说 Essentials 灯带吧。

自从搬进了出租屋，夜间的照明问题其实一直困扰着我。靠近床的那个灯开关离床还是有那么一点远，每次我都要伸长手过去够不说，如今我用上了一分二的插座转换器，这个开关被彻底挡住了。除此之外，这个灯真的很亮，如果是晚上突然打开，我总是会被突然增加到 max 的亮度闪到；就算是开灯阅读或者是玩手机，白色的灯本身也过于寒冷。所以，我一直想买一款能够融入环境，同时亮度也足够的夜间照明用灯。
Nanoleaf Essentials 灯带默认提供 2m 的长度，自带双面胶可以粘贴在光滑的表面，因此我买来之后就贴在了床头。如果日后需要，还可以接续。不过，目前的效果是，灯亮起来…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我曾经在少数派写过不少关于将米家接入 HomeKit 的教程，尽管方法和步骤越来越简单，但无一例外都需要通过代码来进行操作。这对于有编程基础的朋友来说不难，但对大部分不懂代码的人来说就有较高的门槛。一个明显的案例是，每当我发表完一篇教程后，私信里都是各种求助，希望我能够帮他们看看到底是因为什么原因导致的代码报错。
随着智能家居平台和协议的日渐成熟，终于在如今，米家和 HomeKit 之间的互通迎来了一个新的维度：我们已经完全可以在图形化的界面下，来实现过去这些繁琐的操作。在这个过程中，你不会接触到任何一条代码或脚本，只需要用鼠标轻点，就能完全绝大部分的工作。

从 HomeBridge 到 Home Assistant
在过去，我选择将米家接入 HomeKit 的方案一直是 HomeBridge。但这一次我们则要舍弃它，转投到 Home Assistant 的怀抱中。关于二者的原理和差别，这里就不展开细说，主要来了解一下，为什么要转投到一个新的平台上。
首先，Home Assistant 丰富的开发者和生态环境，是这次能够实现无代码操作的根本。虽然如今 HomeBridge 也在往无代码操作的方向努力，但由于不少旧插件作者已经不再更新，自然就不会再支持图形化编辑。所以，选择 HomeBridge 大都还是无法摆脱写 config.json 文件的命运 —— 而这正好是新手最容易出错的地方。
标有 Verified 的就是可以图形化操作的插件，但是一些老旧的插件就无法使用了
其次是 Home Assistant 更加丰富的接入类型。如果是用 HomeBridge，则每个设备必须要有一个对应的插件，否则便无法接入。例如米家后续推出的一些基于蓝牙 Mesh 网络产品，HomeBridge 完全没辙，至今都找不到对应的插件。但 Home Assistant 属于来者不拒，无论是 Z…]]></summary>

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto” tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Celebrate with Miranda, Beatriz and the rest of the “Encanto” family streaming now on Disney+.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, we will learn how to change the Build path of a React application. Here I'm using a shell script for moving the contents inside the build folder to another location. 
Create a {file-name}.sh file inside the root directory of your react app. 


Open to your package.json file.


Just beneath the build script, add a new one called "postbuild" with a value "./{file-name}.sh".




if you are using Windows, use bash before executing the script.

This shell script is executed right after the build process, and the actual magic happens inside the shell script.
#If the folder exists, remove it first, then copy the files
if [ -d "./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/" ]; then

    rm -rv ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/*
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/

#Else make a new folder and then move the files.
else
    mkdir -p ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/
fi


In my case, I just wanted to move the build folder contents to my server folder.
This script can be customized to your need. Just go through some simple shell-script tutorials. Here what is helping us is the 'postbuild' script that will be automatically executed after the build command.
Happy Coding 🥳]]></summary>

I found that Mailchimp has a feature for automatically sending to an email list based on RSS feed updates on a website.
A RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized way.
RSS feeds are usually generated for you in website builders and other tools but since my site was built from scratch I needed to make my own.
Here is what I needed to do:

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous actions, as well as data validation, authentication, and interactive API documentation, all of which are powered by OpenAPI. It comes with exciting features like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we will cover another important structural directive provided by the Angular Team - ngFor
ngFor
Lets see that in practice-
structural-directive-demo.component.ts file and add the below code -
itemsToBuy = ['Pencil', 'Notebook', 'School bag', 'Eraser'];

and in component template file add the below code -
<div *ngFor="let item of itemsToBuy">
  {{ item }}
</div>

Now if you start the application and open localhost:4200 in the browser you would see the below output -

*ngFor="let item of itemsToBuy" 
= operator.
itemsToBuy is the array we declared in the component TS file. We use the for-of syntax to loop through the array. Every item in the array is assigned to the variable item which is then printed in between div tag by using the {{item}}. The loop is auto incremented and moves to the next item until all the items are printed.
item variable holds a string value.
list of objects. 
A word of Caution
For example ngIf and ngFor at the same div element is not allowed.
That's all about ngFor. Hope you enjoyed the post.
Cheers!!!
Happy Coding]]></summary>

How is it that a little over 35000 java packages, amounting to 8% of the Maven Central Repository has been impacted due to the log4shell vulnerability. How is it that a vulnerability in a logging library could result in a CVSS score of 10[the highest it can go is 10]. This classic java logging library hitting mainstream feels so odd. Two different worlds that shouldn't be meeting.
In this blog, let's understand what is log4j and what exactly is this log4shell vulnerability and why it happened? 

What is log4j?


Apache Log4j is one of the most utilized logging library in the Java ecosystem. If you ever worked within a Java application, you've probably seen log4j in action. Log4j along with the basic log…]]></summary>

This is my dream as I know this role comes with many flexible tasks, it uses math & finance which I find very interesting and where I can, apply my coding skills. 
I have been developing computer programs since I was 11 years old. The first programming language I learned was html if you even dare to call it one. Quickly after this, I learned JavaScript, Python and then C. Python is by far my favourite programming language, since it’s easy to use, clear and has many powerful libraries. 
I started to make my own programs and discovered that I could use Python libraries to speed up development. From this, I learned about open-source projects which helped me a…]]></summary>

终于有一部题材特别的国产动画了。

@一只索狗：第一次看到预告片的时候就关注到这部作品，主要是因为它特别的题材背景，是我们的传统文化舞狮，我也在心里默默感叹：「终于有人拍些除了西游、古代神话故事之外的题材了。」
剧情讲述了留守少年阿娟和好友阿猫、阿狗在退役狮王咸鱼强的培训下参加舞狮比赛，最终「咸鱼翻身」的故事，主旨就是追逐梦想和生活现实的矛盾冲突。努力、热血、感动这些剧情关键词听起来有些套路，但本片处理方式得当…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​年关将至，如果说回头看这一年联盟出现了什么变化，或许现在高居东部第五的骑士队会是个值得关注的惊喜。
虽然这么说有点马后炮，但这支球队自小比克斯塔夫接手之后就隐隐约约给人一种将要崛起的气质。
人们总喜欢从成功的结果往前倒推复盘，然后总结出各种各样的理由，但最后得出的结论往往既没有参考性也没有可复制性，因为球队的发展不是加减乘除的方程式，每一个做出影响的因素都不是固定的常量，变量太多的事情你怎么复制？
给骑士的成功总结原因其实没多大意思，比起事后吹捧他们怎样慧眼识珠凑到这套阵容，不如讨论一下他们现在到底强在哪里？
从数据上看，新赛季骑士最好的环节是防守：目前他们每百回合只丢103.5分，这个数字排在联盟第3，仅次于勇士和太阳两支胜率在80%以上的独一档球队。



而骑士防守出彩很大程度上与他们的三高体系有关。有趣的是，由于活塞曾经有不堪入目的三高失败案例，“德拉蒙德+约什-史密斯+门罗”攻不能守不行，所以骑士实施三高体系的初期并不被球迷看好。
这也很难说是球迷没有眼光，因为把阿伦+莫布里+马尔卡宁的组合冠以“三高“的标签存在一定的误导性。
虽然他们的身高都超过2米11，但良好的机动性使得他们不能与普通的内线的球员混为一谈。
实质上，骑士”三高“内核里藏着的是“小球”，三高确实是高，但他们却具备“小球时代”最强调的核心竞争力——防守的伸缩性。
阿伦谈到骑士的长人体系这样说：“也许球风回到2001年不是坏事”，但骑士看似古早的篮球哲学只是表象，踩准现代篮球获益点才是他们真正做成的事情。
尤其是阿伦作为三高体系的代言人，他或许是这个“反差萌”的最佳代表。为什么这么说？因为莫布里和马尔卡宁虽然都是7尺长人，但他们本身就在4-5号位摇摆，甚至能漂移到3号位的现代独角兽。而阿伦属于典型的传统护框型内线，但传统的外衣下却是反差极大的，适应小球时代的可塑性。

此前我对于乐高的印象，只有「购买套装回来自己拼」，以及它的英文名 LEGO 是来自于丹麦语「LEg GOdt」，意为「Play Well」，玩得开心。
而在仔细逛完坐落在广州正佳广场，全球最大的乐高品牌旗舰店之后，我不仅拥有了属于自己的「定制小人仔」，还发现了「自选拼搭颗粒」「马赛克像素画定制」等独特的玩法。在这篇文章中，我将以广州正佳广场的旗舰店为例，来聊聊我们逛乐高旗舰店时，除了买套装，我们还可以留意的东西，希望能为你的双旦礼物挑选补充一个有趣的选择～

定制小人仔
哪个乐高玩家不想拥有一个专属于自己的定制人仔呢？前段时间 Tp 在 新玩意 分享了自己定制的乐高人仔，身在广州的我，自然也不会错过可以在家门口定制人仔的机会。于是在和 Tp 约稿之后，我也终于拥有了一个独一无二的乐高人仔。

定制人仔的步骤很简单，主要有以下几步：
购买

在收银台购买乐高小人仔工厂套装。

以广州乐高旗舰店为例，想要定制一个属于自己的人仔，首先要到收银台购买一个乐高小人仔工厂套装，定价是 99 元 / 个。完成付款之后，工作人员会递给自己一个包装盒，拿着包装盒到定制台进行扫描就可以开始定制啦。如果你去的时候人比较多，可能需要先跟工作人员签到排号，并且可能会限制你的定制时间。

个性化定制

在小人仔工厂机器上扫描套装，输入你的姓名，开始设计吧。

将购买好的包装盒放在定制台上，屏幕会出现「输入你的姓名」的提示，系统内置中文输入法并支持中文混排。输入好名字之后会打印在一个 1x3 的砖块上，可以作为小人仔的站台。

开始定制之后，我们可以对小人仔上装的正反面进行设计，而头部、裤部…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[能说总是好事，不管正派还是反派
by 乌合之子但愿君
☆本文包括对大量影视、动画作品的反派的剧透，请谨慎阅读。☆
反派死于话多，其实还有两句话，一句是主角胜于嘴炮，一句是主角死于不补刀。但是本文是讲反派的，所以关于主角的故事，等下次有机会我们再分析吧。
反派为什么死于话多呢？这句话到底是怎么来的呢？
本着打破砂锅问到底的精神，我进行了一番仔细的考证，发现了一个记入影视评论书的来源。美国影评达人罗杰·伊伯特（Roger Ebert）的书《我知道你们又来这一套》里收录了这个词条。

全文如下：
Fallacy of the Talking Killer。
The villain wants to kill the hero. He has him cornered at gunpoint. All he has to do is pull the trigger. But he always talks first. He explains the hero's mistakes to him. Jeers. Laughs. And gives the hero time to think his way out of the situation, or be rescued by his buddy. Cf. most James Bond movies.[1]
反派死于话多之误。反派一直梦想杀掉主角。他已经用枪把主角逼到了墙角，只需轻轻一扣扳机就大功告成了；但他开始详细地阐述主角所犯的错误，然后嘲讽一番、冷笑几声。而所有这些嘴炮存在的意义就是为了让主角有充足的时间思考该如何逃生，或者成功地被同伴解救。007系列电影中的詹姆斯·邦德先生就是这种现象的受益者。
这本书里还收录了很多奇奇怪的词条，比如：

我们希望通过最简洁通俗的描述，带领大家了解信息储存设备的基本原理，知道那些复杂的参数，如何挑选购买适合自己的存储设备，又是如何更好地使用，更安全稳定地保存我们的数据，以及未来我们能够用上什么技术。 另本系列虽然与 aigo 联合发起，但所有内容不涉及任何品牌指导或要求的商业营销。

上一章我们了解到了另一种特殊的储存介质，运行内存的方方面面，本章我们就继续来介绍除了机械硬盘和固态硬盘外，我们常用的一些储存设备，包括 U 盘、内存卡、移动硬盘和手机储存芯片。它们都是使用 NAND 颗粒来储存数据，并且有着相同的工作结构，不过形态和实际性能却截然不同。
U 盘的结构原理和常见参数
说完运行内存，接下来再说一个大家更加熟悉的东西 —— U 盘（很多人也叫它优盘）。从学生时代开始，这玩意儿估计是大部分人必备的一个东西，带着我们重要的文档（或许还有病毒~），流连在各个电脑的 USB 接口之间。比如底下这个超经典的金士顿 U 盘，应该都曾经拥有或者见过别人用这个吧：
经典的红色透明金士顿 Kingston U 盘，型号是 DT101G2
如果你年纪比较小，那经典的 U 盘应该换成这个：
新经典金属外壳金士顿 Kingston U 盘，型号是 DTSE9/DTSE9G2
也许现在大部分人用的还是好几年前的 U 盘，但其实除了我们印象中的那些经典 U 盘，现在的 U 盘已经发展得更加成熟，稳定性和速度都有了很大提升，还出现了新的品类。接下来我就给大家详细介绍一下 U 盘的结构原理和一些我们需要了解的参数。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你好，我是射手夸夸。
如果你想在游戏中掌控局势，那么请与我一起让更多ADC成为ADC吧。
笔者曾用烬（场数占比70%+）打上艾欧尼亚最强王者段位，也常使用烬上分。本篇为戏命师·烬的英雄攻略文章，其中内容涵盖英雄优劣势分析、版本解读、符文与装备选择、技能理解与分析、打法技巧以及对线不同ADC的一些经验。
烬在国服较为冷门，即便他往往能成为赛场中的宠儿、版本里的顶流。我相信烬能受到召唤师们的喜爱，于是我在去年8月份，通过图文、视频的形式，较为完整地创作了烬的英雄攻略，或许有朋友已在之前看过，不过不必担心，这篇文章在许多地方有了优化更新，也增添了一些内容。
射手夸夸：戏命师·烬！万字攻略教你玩好“艺术家”
相信会有更多人喜欢烬，也相信大家都能成为一名高手烬。
（此为11.2-11.3版本所作，而现在3月4日版本已更新，故有些地方与当下有别，除版本外不影响阅读，之后版本更新对烬有较大影响时，会将文字优化更新）
英雄优劣、版本、符文与装备

烬于2016年2月18日登场，成为召唤师峡谷的第129名英雄，登场第一年就拥有了冠军皮肤，SKT-T1-烬。
之前有朋友问我喜欢用哪个皮肤，哪个皮肤手感好，我个人推荐暗星尊，至于之后的新皮肤就需要用过才知道了。

许多玩家对他有一个身体上的误解，他其实不是瘸子，走路一瘸一拐是因为他把武器拆分放在身上，武器太重所以导致走路姿态异常，在开大的时候就会掏出并进行组装。
官方也说过烬是个健全的人，机械那半边只是护臂，是减轻枪后坐力用的，肩膀上突出来的一块是武器组件。当然一些玩家也已习惯称呼烬为瘸子了，我想他这个用枪当作画笔的艺术家不会在意。

我于杀戮之中盛放，一如黎明中的花朵。烬的魅力不仅源于台词和沈磊老师的配音，同时烬的名称戏命师以及各个技能和效果的名称也非常酷。
1、枪的名字叫低语，第四发子弹叫终章，打出第四发或者w定住人叫完美；
2、Q技能曼舞手…]]></summary>

本周话题：下一个内卷的行业
一年多以前，周刊讨论过，"内卷"这个词到底是什么意思？
当时的结论是，内卷的原义是"向内发展"，因为向外发展受到了阻碍，就开始向内部要效益。结果往往是恶性竞争，因为 蛋糕做不大了，大家只能争夺对方的份额。

一年过去了，内卷已经成了常见词。
很多行业早就出现了内卷，比如培训业、电商、视频、直播等等。这样的行业，都有一个共同点：市场没有扩张，利润没有增长，但是从业人员却越来越忙、越来越累，业务开展越来越难。
下一个内卷的行业，会是谁？
我也不卖关子，直接说吧，很可能是游戏业。

你可能不相信这个结论：游戏业非常赚钱，而且一直在高速增长，怎么会内卷呢？
我本来也不相信，但是上周发布的《2021年中国游戏产业报告》，公布了中国游戏市场的两个增长率：
销售收入增长 6.40%，达到2965亿。
游戏用户增长 0.22%，达到6.66亿。

这两个增长率都非常低。
销售收入虽然增长6.4%，但如果考虑到游戏业的投入，每年都在增加，就意味着，今年的行业利润没有增长，可能还有下跌。
更要命的是，用户总数只增长了0.22%。这是有史以来最低的增长率，以前每年游戏人口都要增长几千万，今年只增长了100多万，接近零增长了。

这就是说，国内的游戏用户可能已经到天花板了，市场饱和了。玩游戏的人口大概就是这个数量了，国内的游戏市场以后就没有增量用户了。
虽然游戏行业还是会成长，因为每个用户的游戏支出会增加。但是，一个行业…]]></summary>

Aqui vai um exemplo:

My only experience before this course was the FCC HTML course and a part of the JS course, so I knew already some of the things that were shown, but it was still a good training and also taught many things I didn't knew.
All in all I can recommend this course.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we will continue our journey in understanding the other built in Angular directives mainly the Structural Directives.
structural directives. 
The first directive which we will understand is the ngIf directive.
The structural directives always starts with an asterisk * 
*ngIf
A point to note
The element is completely removed from the DOM if the condition executes to false. It will not occupy any space in the DOM.
Now lets see in practice-
structural-directive-demo.
post.

To be precise add the variable myAge and assign the value 18 to it.
export class StructuralDirectiveDemoComponent implements OnInit {

  myAge = 18;

  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit(): void { }
}

Now open the corresponding html template file and paste in the below code-
<p *ngIf="myAge >= 18">I am an Adult!</p>
<p *ngIf="myAge < 18">I am a CHILD</p>

Now lets start the application and open the browser and open localhost:4200.

The variable myAge is holding the value 18 (the model).
<p *ngIf="myAge >= 18">I am an Adult!</p>
myAge >= 18 returns true which is assigned to the directive ngIf. Since true is assigned to the directive ngIf the p tag is visible.
myAge variable value to say 17 so that the above condition is false but the second line of code 
<p *ngIf="myAge < 18">I am a CHILD</p> returns true.
Now if you open the browser you will see that the output changes.
p tag is not shown/ hidden while the second p tag is shown which was hidden when the model value was 18.

  checkAge() {
    if (this.myAge >= 18) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

and in html template file you can call the function inside ngIf like below -
<p *ngIf="checkAge()">I am an Adult!</p>

Note
Any values like false, null, undefined, empty string when assigned to ngIf will result in hiding the element.
Hope you enjoyed the post.
Cheers!!!
Happy Coding]]></summary>

It's no secret that the job market is competitive. You need to stand out from the crowd in order to get noticed and nab an interview. But what if you're struggling with where to start? What should you do? The answer lies in your side hustle!
A side hustle, or "hustle" for short, is any project or venture you take on outside of your day job (or night job) that provides supplemental income. It could be something as simple as making candles at home; it could also be a full-time business like running a bakery.
Hustling is the act of making money outside of your 9-5 job or business. Side hustles are usually small ventures that provide supplemental income, but they can also turn into full-time gigs

Knowledge is power! 
Knowing what events have taken place in your Netlify project, and being able to trigger actions based on those events, is pretty bloomin’ powerful too!
Netlify creates a variety of events throughout the lifecycle of your site deployments and for other services we provide for your sites, such as form submissions. Each of these events can create notifications and trigger actions elsewhere.
Combining tools and services using events and triggers opens up all kinds of fun possibilities for your projects!

What is fascinating is that planning and creating a design template is better as it allows you to check which font and colors suit your website and style, because it's not easy to change theme of whole website once it's somewhat or maybe completely built as compare to UI creation tools.

Using such tools like FIGMA and Adobe XD allows us to quickly do those changes and finalize the design, all then is left to implement them in real-time website.
*1. Icons *
https://www.flaticon.com/ that I personally use when it comes to icons and small vectors to aid website looks.

2. Theme and colors
https://flatuicolors.com/ as it provides best colors and combos that are so perfect when actually implemented. It's easy and free to use :)

3. Images
https://unsplash.com/ although you might already know about it. But something that you might not be knowing is that they also provide users with an API that provide aesthetic images by artists for you to implement in your source code.

4. Fonts. YES! please
https://fonts.google.com/ or https://fontawesome.com/ (font awesome provides icons as well).

Hope all this was useful to you and I hope you'll apply these in your projects so they would look even more attractive.
Try finding the best resources that suits and makes you paragraphs sexier!]]></summary>

@sveltejs (SvelteKit) + @tailwindcss

@nextjs + @chakra_ui / @tailwindcss 
Backend

First of all: I love frontend development. It is the direct touchpoint to the user for websites / -apps. It is the first impression for the user.
There is so much out there. It can be paralyzing. I already used a variety of frontend frameworks: React (CRA, Gatsby, NextJS), Vue, Angular, Svelte (SvelteKit). And as far as styling goes, I've tried a lot of things too: CSS (modules), SASS, CSS-in-JS, Material, Bootstrap, Bulma, Quasar, Tailwind…]]></summary>

Dream.In.Code was originally just me learning how to install a forum and it turned in to a thriving community. Over the years, other sites have grown and changes in search rankings have seen traffic decline which also means advertising...

很多读者都会好奇少数派的编辑们到底平时都「买了啥」。我们希望通过「编辑部的新玩意」介绍编辑部成员们最近在用的新奇产品，让他们自己来谈谈这些新玩意的使用体验究竟如何。

@北鸮：Paperwill 2022 纸志地球模型台历

购买渠道：天猫
入手价格：168 元

2022 年眼看就到了，最近几天一直盘算着买个日历。原本是想整个台历，记点儿每天的什么重大事件的，后来想想好像有手机有手帐，我也没什么再整个记事台历的必要，于是就奔着桌面摆件的方向去找。原本是相中了即刻出的那款「今天是周五吗」，但当我看到的时候，它就早早卖空了。
本着达成「桌面摆件」和「每天撕一页的仪式感」两个原则，我最终入手了这款 Paperwill 出产的「纸志地球」。

就我的理解，本质上这应该是借鉴日本 TRIAD Inc. 几年前大火的 OMOSHIROI BLOCK 纸雕便签系列。当时那款纸雕便签从边缘一层层揭下逐渐露出京都清水寺的设计让人眼前一亮。稍有差别的是纸志地球由于纸雕最终成球形，是以中心为轴，日历纸做成三角，旋转排布，逐渐露出地球的纸雕。

这个日历还配备一个亚克力罩子，撕完扣上可以直接当成展示盒。扯下来的纸张其实也可以当成小便签贴在显示器下面。很显然，它唯一的实用价值就是一眼看明白今天是几号。对我来说，它最大的作用就是好看，早起撕一页开始新一天，神清气爽。
由于我没有那个上来就把所有日历就撕掉直接看纸雕的魄力，而且还想看看露到一半的地球是个什么样子，这里就只能把店铺的成品图搬过来了。纸雕看起来还是比较细腻的，大尺度的海拔变化也有体现，想想一年后我就能有一个可爱的纸雕地球摆件，还是有点期待的。

关联阅读：油猴使用指南 01：传说中的「油猴」与用户脚本
移动端浏览器使用用户脚本
想要在移动端浏览器使用用户脚本，我们一般而言有两类选择：一是使用支持扩展插件的浏览器，通过安装扩展插件（如 Tampermonkey）来支持用户脚本；而如果浏览器不支持扩展插件，则可以直接支持用户脚本。
下面我也按照这两大类别简单介绍一下。
支持扩展插件的移动端浏览器
这里本来想展开写一下，但是发现 jijiali 和克莱德珠玉在先，已经写了这篇文章。我这里就不展开写了，仅作为省流助手，列几款常见的支持扩展插件的移动端浏览器。

Firefox：使用 Firefox 应用商店，使用自己的 Gecko 浏览器核心
Yandex：来自俄罗斯的应用，使用 Chrome 应用商店
Kiwi Browser：基于Chromium 核心，使用 Chrome 应用商店
神马浏览器（Sleipnir Mobile）：使用自己的应用商店

此外，最近还有这个浏览器值得一看——Iceraven：基于火狐同款的 Gecko 内核开发，支持扩展程序（Firefox 应用商店），如果你下载 Iceraven 会发现这两个界面几乎都一样，甚至 Iceraven 还支持火狐账户同步。

题外话：你可能会纳闷，Iceraven 和 Firefox 有什么区别呢？

根据 Iceraven 自己的 介绍，它有两个核心的区别：

Iceraven 可以访问 about:config 页面来做一些修改和调整
Firefox 只限制了部分附加组件在 Android 端使用，Iceraven 支持更多的附加组件。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上次谈练字这件事已经是 四年前 了。彼时我并没有想到，未来的生活会和手里的纸笔越来越远。尤其是成功读研后，我的生活就和纸笔完全断了联系。脱离了需要一直手画重点的医学课本，电子版文献的数量剧增让我不得不告别此前什么资料都要打印出来的习惯，再一步步进化到完全在 iPad 上批注、听讲、做笔记，直到毕业了开始工作了，我手里还是有一大把没用完的墨水和笔芯。
这还只是摆在我桌面上的一部分
重提练字这件事，开始于前几天和因为钢笔认识的朋友聊天之后。他的工作内容比较传统，每天需要大量开会，几乎随时与纸笔为伴，随手写的笔记也字字有形——拉马克的「用进废退」理论用来直接解释进化论非常扯淡，映照在个体的生活中反而十分合理。如同缺乏日常使用的我几乎把本就不多的数学知识忘了个精光，等我尝试去好好写几个字，才发现握了笔，我的手都有点抖。
肌肉记忆也是需要唤醒的。我尝试着寻找了新的工具与合适的方法，重启我的练字之路。这篇文章我将主要从几个常常讨论到的问题出发，聊一聊现在还想练字的我们可能会考虑到、会发出疑惑的细节。
我能用平板和手机练字吗？
先说结论：不能。其原因和 这篇 英文书法入门指南中提到的类似。
或许你在各种社交平台见过那些在 iPad 上创作各种养眼的手写作品的影像，请记住，这些作者绝对不是在 iPad 上练好字才发出来的，而是先前已经有了写字的底子。iPad 对于会写字的人来说是一个只需要简单熟悉的新工具，而对于「不会写字」需要练字的我们来说，它并不是一个好的起点。
对于起源于象形符号，且正统书法审美来源于软笔书法的中文来说，即使在已经广泛使用硬笔作为书写工具的现在，想要更快抓住中文书写的要领，还是应当采用能够明确给予物理反馈的纸笔。如果以之前西文书法探讨的内容作为类比，中文书法，即使在使用硬笔时，也时时刻刻在采用基于「点尖」的书法技巧。如果你去观察一个正经现代书法家书写的钢笔字帖，就会发…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文由西甲官方提供合作支持，首发 @体育产业生态圈 


前些天，一位西甲联盟的工作人员突然给我发了条消息：“有没有兴趣写篇文章，聊聊我们上赛季是如何帮助格拉纳达击败巴萨的？”
我当即愣在了原地，用不停颤抖的手指做出了回复：“这个……真的是能放到台面上讲的事情吗？”
等到对方发来一大堆资料和视频的时候，我才焕然大悟。原来故事是这样的：格拉纳达教练团队的分析师阿尔瓦罗-加西亚近期谈到了球队回到西甲后这两个赛季的成功里，数据分析起到了至关重要的作用。更神奇的是，他们的数据分析系统并不是俱乐部自己搭建的，而是西甲联盟对所有西甲和西乙球队免费开放的平台Mediacoach。
作为例子，他重点提到的就是今年四月格拉纳达客场2-1击败巴萨的那场比赛。


【那场比赛里发生了什么？】
已经过去了8个月的时间，可能不少球迷已经不太有印象了，所以咱们先简单回顾一下剧情：巴萨当时与皇马、马竞之间的西甲冠军竞争日趋白热化，那场比赛他们也牢牢掌握了控球权。上半场各种围攻并且由梅西打进一球，但下半场被马奇斯和莫里纳连入两球逆转。
那是格拉纳达队史首次在诺坎普击败巴萨，之前他们在这里的成绩惨到25场全败，连一分都没有拿到过。也是因为这场爆冷输球，巴萨错过了登顶积分榜首的绝佳机会，后来丢掉心气率先退出了冠军争夺。

那么问题来了，这场比赛和那个叫Mediacoach的数据平台有什么关系呢？
再来简单科普一下这个平台，这是由西甲联盟开发的数据分析可视化系统，通过架设在西甲和西乙42队主场的高速摄像头来采取每场比赛里的专业数据，最终形成一个庞大的数据库系统和大量自动生成的报告。
重点来了：这个平台对每一家俱乐部都完全开放，免费、没有VIP和白金会员，甚至还不停呼吁你们赶紧来白嫖。

有的俱乐部坚信天下没有白吃的午餐，本身也不怎么把数据分析当回事，但也有人产生了浓厚的兴趣，比如格拉纳达。系统上线时，这家来自安…]]></summary>

因为我喜欢时常记录自己的生活，除了一堆所思所想的文字内容外，照片应用里也记录下了这几年的点点滴滴。除了偶尔怀旧，我也不会盯着相册的日日累积，只是任由相册占用的 iCloud 空间扩充着。
直到有一天，听到朋友为几万张照片的整理和去留烦恼时，翻看手机才意识到我的照片也已经超过了一万张。我决定给自己的相册瘦个身，主要是为了保证自己能够在海量的照片中快速定位到想找的内容，毕竟在此之前我就已经经历过很多次照片翻找不到的情况。但整理照片这件事情，我不需要一劳永逸，我更喜欢细水长流，有空的时候能够整理一下其实就足够了。
翻找应用，意外中意上国货「减法相册」
比起纯手动的 Slidebox，Cleanup 和 Gemini 的设计显然更得我心，但仅仅增加了重复照片这项功能就收价不斐，让我有些犹豫。近些年来，国人开发者的声量逐渐提升，照片处理领域就没有好的作品吗？

答案显然是不，很快我就在社交平台上发现了「减法相册」这款应用，即使才发布了第一个正式版本，功能值得说道的同时颜值过关，可以说是质量不错的「国货应用」了。
减法相册看到了「随手」整理的需求
不是所有人的照片都会规规矩矩地拍好，修好，传到社交网站、社区平台的，大多数人是像我一样，拍完即走，偶尔修修，看心情发送的普通人。但这并不意味着普通人没有整理的需求，相反，普通人的相册更加需要整理，减法相册找到了这群人对于整理的不同层次的需求，也恰好匹配了我的想法。

After all, when your customer base is spread around the world, how do you scale your customer service?
Unbabel has built their business around the idea that customer service can be delivered in any language quickly and efficiently with the right blend of AI and human intelligence, creating a platform they call "Language Operations" or LangOps.
Jonathan Sowler, VP of Engineering at Unbabel, joins Dev Interrupted to talk about machine learning, what it takes to build a product that seamlessly integrates AI and human-powered translations, and why the future of language involves emojis.
Dan and Jonathan also rundown LinearB metrics and why Jonathan believes implementing LinearB has improved the health of Unbabel's engineering team.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



What is LangOps?
How ML can be applied to different brands
Unbabel's use of WorkerB

Why Unbabel chose to implement LinearB metrics

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[React.memo() is one of those things that should be a part of every React developer's arsenal. It gives us the ability to memoize a React component. As with any tool, before we delve into how to use React.memo(), let's understand the problem first.
Memoization is a general concept which basically means caching the results of some kind of computation for later use. It is an optimization technique which is used quite extensively in the programming world.
An important point to remember is that whenever memoization is used, there must be a criteria which would dicate when the cached results are no longer valid and the computation must be done again.
To understand the problem this solves, consider the following React component:

To a lot of people, a new year means new potential. It feels like a fresh start and the drive to make changes and do well is at an all-time high. A lot of that is because after the madness of the holidays and reflecting on the year behind us, we’re able to take a slight break before going back into our routine - and often, we’d like that routine to change.
Resolutions are nothing new. They have been around for a very long time and even though a lot of people make resolutions they end up breaking, the idea behind the resolution is what we find important.
Striving to grow and change and be a better version of ourselves is something we should all be doing throughout our entire lives. It keeps everyone constantly moving forward and adapting, and …]]></summary>

To make things even easier, I wrote a shellmarks wrapper script for this that provides an intuitive GUI form.

Simply paste in the URL and press “Download”, and it will download the video to your “Downloads” directory.
Pytube installation instructions can be found here.
The TLDR of the install instructions, if you have Python 3 already installed, is to open Terminal and enter:

Netscape navigator was the ruler among browsers then.
Lately I've been doing fontend with GWT and now React for the last couple of years. I love React but doing form, collecting server state and keeping state in sync on the client has been very challenging. I've used Redux, Jotai, Cerebral JS, Overmind JS (favorite) to name a few state libraries.

I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube for the Beem Team. I've built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob's house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I've never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. 

If you’re reading this you’re a real one! 
Comment “Fortnite Chapter 3!" so I can notice you!

Not Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a Real Life Fortnite Battle Bus to celebrate the release of Fortnite Chapter 3!]]></summary>

Alright so in this video I made some custom minecraft bosses and got a real mod developer to react to/review my designs. I ended up making bosses for the amethyst geodes, mountains, and nether biomes. They turned out really good! Sorry this video took so long to come out, we're working on some big things! My mental health is on an unbelievably sharp decline, so I don’t know when I will be back, but I love making videos so I won’t be gone forever

🟦 Material Design Award 2021

经过了多年的演进与迭代，Material Design 如今也已不再局限于简单的 Android 应用 UI 设计指南那样简单。为了启发更多开发者在 Material Design 现有的基础上进行创新、同时适应随时代变化的应用设计需求，Material Design 官方设计团队每年都会根据不同的设计准则来为评奖，借此鼓励在 Material Design 设计领域作出创新的 App —— 这一奖项即是 Material Design Award。
今年临近尾声，Material Design Award 2021 的评选也已经出炉。

由于稍早之前我们已经在少数派发布了关于的此次评选的专题文章，所以在本期周报中仅作相对简单的补充说明。虽然今年 MD Award 以暗色主题、大屏版本适配、动效设计而非 Android 12 中的 Material You 为评选参考这一标准略显奇怪，但更奇怪的其实一直是 Google 评选这些年度 App 的标准：今年上榜的三款除了 Post-it 与 Todoist 都是相对老生常谈的工具类 App 之外，另一个因暗色模式适配而上榜的 Meetly 更是一款在 Play 商店中不温不火的视频会议应用。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无论是 Windows、macOS、Linux 还是在其他更小众的操作系统当中，文件管理器一定是最为常见也最为常用软件之一。
而在 Windows 平台，从古早时代的「我的电脑」到 Windows 7 的「计算机」，再到 Windows 10 时代的「此电脑」，Windows 资源管理器经过多年的更新和开发后已经拥有了较为完善的功能。随着 Windows 11 的发布，微软为资源管理器带来了一套全新的设计语言，但不少人所期待的标签页、文件标签、更好用的文件预览等特性依然缺席，也难免引来「换汤不换药」的质疑。
如果你和我一样对 Windows 资源管理器有着更多的需求，不妨来看看这款既有颜值、功能又十分强大的第三方文件资源管理应用 —— Files。

优雅是它给人的第一印象
与 Windows 原生的文件资源管理器相比，Files 进行了不少的界面优化。作为更加「现代」的文件管理器，它引入了大量的微软流畅设计语言，界面元素之间的间距更加舒适，还去掉了不少系统文件管理器中残留的过时设计。
与此同时，Files 依然严格遵循并跟进了 Windows 11 的最新特性，包括新的上下文菜单交互逻辑和最新的 API 接口。在这些特性的加持下，Files 颜值更高的同时也有着非常纯正的「原生味儿」。
例如，左侧原生的文件资源管理器中，鼠标移到图标上还会有 Windows 7 时代残留的蓝色选中框，而 Files 已经全面采用 Windows 11 的设计语言
不过要说二者在 UI 上最大的不同，还是对地址栏、搜索栏和快速操作栏的 UI 调整。在 Files 中，文件夹的定位按钮、地址栏和搜索栏的层级显然是更高的，针对具体文件的操作按钮和浏览方式按钮则下放到了与文件浏览界面的同一层级。个人认为，从逻辑上来说这样的布局方式是更加符合文件管理直觉的，操作时也能带来更强的条理感。
上：原生文件…]]></summary>

【爱上甘肃的一万种可能】
我曾经想过一万种爱上甘肃的可能
却唯独忘记了它骨子里的桀骜不驯


在多年以后
只是见到它的一瞬间
我变沉沦了
——【小纪】自驾外星谷






【初识】
当初去兰州也只是匆匆一面，我甚至忘记曾经去过两次这件事，只是依稀记得当年上大学，坐着火车躺在卧铺上就出发了，沿途从夏天到冬天，绿色变成黄土坡，偶尔还有雪山。
后来我穿着破洞裤站在兰州站，寒风飕飕的往里刮，瑟瑟发抖。


【我怀念的】
从甘肃回来的半个月里，我一直都不能忘记旅途中的那种感受，从惊喜、到震撼、再到敬畏，怀念至今。
七彩丹霞，中国的大地彩虹。





外星谷，穿越宇宙吧！必去！必去！必去！！！






冰沟丹霞，被低估的嶙峋美





平山湖大峡谷，“媲美克罗拉多大峡谷”





甘加秘境，我大概会永远记得见到它第一面的震撼，庞然大物般的白石崖垂直在面前。









【自驾行程表】
Day1：落地张掖
Day2：张掖—七彩丹霞—冰沟丹霞；自驾约300km
Day3：外星谷—平山湖大峡谷—山丹军马场；自驾约327km
Day4：山丹军马场骑马—骊轩古城—武威；自驾约268km
Day5：天梯山石窟—永泰古城—兰州；自驾约400km
Day6：兰州—米拉日巴佛阁——尕秀村—郭莽湿地—郎木寺；自驾约350km
Day7：郎木寺—扎尕那；自驾约2650km
Day8：桑科草原—拉卜楞寺—甘家秘境；自驾约160km
Day9：甘家秘境—兰州（返程）；自驾约340km


【交通】
——飞机：去程是北京飞张掖；返程是兰州飞北京
——自驾：中途全程自驾，我们开的是理想ONE，好多人问我担心电车充电不方便，也担心不能跑西北。但其实理想ONE油电混合，可以跑880km左右。
在市区充满电就行，加油站也挺多。颠簸感很低…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我等了三年，就是要等一个机会，我要争一口气，不是证明我了不起，我是要告诉大家，我曾经失去的我一定要拿回来。

2021 年 10 月 28 日晚八点，尼康新品发布会。我正在上课，所以没有机会认真看完发布会的全部内容。但是当我看到开始铺天盖地在网上转发的尼康 z9 的信息后，心里面属实有点感慨。我慢慢地靠在椅子后背上，缓缓地舒了一口气。
千呼万唤的 Z9 终于来了（来自尼康官网）
小马哥等了三年，但是尼康等待了可远不止三年。这个曾经的巨人，在数据相机时代的冲击下一直显得有点力不从心，踉踉跄跄地想要站稳脚跟。作为一个消费者，和一个对尼康品牌有着特殊感情的人，他的努力我都看在眼里。但是我心里也清楚，在市场上，光有情感的支持并不能解决什么问题，尼康的产品一直给我一种想要努力赶上相机界一流水平的愿望，但是每次都差那么一点，差距还越来越大。甚至曾经有一段时间「尼康倒闭了吗」作为一个半调侃半认真的消息在中国互联网上疯传。

其实联想起它曾经的辉煌历史，和现在的对比往往会更加心酸。他曾经用自己高超的光学设计和先进的相机性能，谱写了相机界一个又一个近乎传奇的故事。对老用户近乎宠溺的照顾，既是口口相传的佳话，又是自缚的囚笼。
想要了解尼康的现在，就得了解他的过往。让我们先把时间拨回过去，回到100年前吧。
诞生在硝烟中
尼康的诞生与战争密不可分。1917 年，也许是因为在第一次世界大战预想到日后的战争需求，日本军方在军事仪器领域大力推进国产化。受此影响，东京测量仪器制造厂（東京計器製作所）的光学部门与岩城玻璃制造厂（岩城硝子製造所）的反射镜部门，在三菱集团（当时还称为三菱合資会社）社长岩崎小弥太的出资支持下集成，设立了日本光学工业股份公司（日本光學工業株式會社）。

1932 年，日本光学第一次生产出以 Nikkor 命名的镜头：Aero-Nikkor，根据命名我们可以推测…]]></summary>

想自己拍个视频、录个 Vlog，没人帮忙盯着构图，那就买一个无线图传？相机图传、监视器，少则几百，多则几千，对于业余玩家或者是刚入门的 UP 主来说，是一笔不小且非必要的支出。我们可以利用相机自带的 app，或者是第三方的附件、app，将我们的手机变成相机的监视器，方便在拍摄视频时进行构图。
使用相机自带的 App 连接
佳能、尼康、索尼、富士、松下 等品牌都为自家的相机提供了无线控制功能，只要手中的相机有蓝牙与 Wi-Fi 连接功能，即可在手机与相机配对后进行操控。
索尼 Imaging Edge Mobile
以索尼相机的 Imaging Edge Mobile 为例，打开相机的「智能遥控」app，使用手机或平板连接到相机的 Wi-Fi 热点后打开 Imaging Edge Mobile，点击「开始」或「连接新拍摄装置」，等待 app 自动连接。
但大部分入门级乃至中档的相机，内置的 Wi-Fi 都仅支持 2.4GHz 频段，信号功率并不算强，当距离稍远或周围的信号干扰一强，乃至转个身走远几步，就会出现卡顿、断连的问题，着实让人头大。（在这里点名批评索尼）
利用采集卡输入视频信号到手机
采集卡这种方法比较特别，通过相机的 HDMI 接口输出视频信号，经由视频采集卡借助 UVC 协议（USB video device class，支持 UVC 协议的数码设备可以在不安装驱动的情况下直接使用，实现免驱）输入到 Android 设备中，目前仅使用于支持 OTG 功能的 Android 手机，如果手机或平板支持 HDMI 信号直接输入…]]></summary>

已完结。有小虐才更显甜~
<三宽驸马—执子手，渡清欢>


【1】
“公主，快起身吧，再晚就要挨训了。”小寅子急得已经半个身子踏出门槛，回首大声催促着。
“急什么，这就快了。太后最宠我们公主了，多晚也不打紧。”阙儿一边说着，脚下左半步右半步来回踱着，仔细检查我的妆容。
半晌，待阙儿终于满意了，对着镜子里的我说，“我们公主真真儿是娇俏明艳，今儿晚定能艳杀四方。”
我扑哧一声笑了出来。
皇宫里就我一个公主，这是要艳过母后呢，还是压一头皇祖母？


到了宫宴上，太后看我慈笑道，“婉扬来啦，你今天可是来晚了，元辰刚闹着要挨着本宫坐，把你的玉案抢去了呢。”
我朝上看去，那本来是我专属的青玉案上果然坐着元辰那个小矮子。他刚准备用小肉手去够吃食，突然听到有人喊他名字，呆在那里一脸傻懵。
环顾四周，只有靠角落一个空座位了。
脚下止了一瞬，转而又大步走了过去。
半步的迟疑是因为那个案台旁座，是顾胤良。


我和顾胤良的第一段梁子也是源于一场宫宴。
那年我五岁，顾胤良六岁。
酒足饭饱后，台下的大臣们愣是从南疆边境纷争聊到了东沧国太子新得了一颗三钱大的冠螺珠。
那时的我天生懒骨，走哪都是歪着倒着，正趴在太后的膝上打盹。
“说到世间珍宝，当属顾大人家的暖香玉。炎暑中自散馥香，冰寒天玉暖生烟。”
听罢，我从迷迷糊糊中起了精神，眼里慢慢聚起精光。
“顾大人，那暖香玉是供奉在在府中吗，哪天领我们一饱眼福？”
已然微醺的顾尚书摆摆手，笑道，“唉，一块玉石而已，谈不上稀奇，一直戴在小儿身上。”
至此我已经趁众人不注意，径自冲向台下。
顾家公子我认识，就是那一堆小人儿里稍微好看一点的那个。
我伸着手，直直的就往顾胤良扑过去，企图去拽他脖颈里的吊绳。
彼时顾胤良一脸惊恐，本能的一手护住自己的衣领，一手把我往外推。
嘿，我，楮婉扬，大楮皇室十三子嗣里唯一的掌上明珠，大名鼎鼎的嘉垣公主，自打生下来…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[甘肃，最“瓷实”的模样，最悠然的姿态，藏在早餐里。
这是一个狭长的省份，当最东边的庆阳看到第一缕阳光时，西边的敦煌还是明月高悬。巨大的经纬跨越，也扩大了早餐的选择范围，当甘肃人迎着日出逐渐醒来，他们手里的早餐，可能完全不同。


尽管如此，早餐赋予的是同样的朝气，以及，不管甘肃哪里的早餐，都长得十分“瓷实”。瓷实，是因为重视，甘肃有多重视早餐呢？这么说吧，牛肉面，甘肃最扎实，最著名的一碗面，兰州人就留给了早晨。
寻常的油条包子菜夹馍，是早餐中的一种吃法，如果你有心留意，走进甘肃各地街头巷尾热气蒸腾的早餐店里，会进入一个甘肃特色的早餐江湖——



当兰州人早上“扎”起一碗牛肉面，酒泉人在吃浓稠的糊锅，武威人在吃“硬核”菜面，张掖人在吃牛肉小饭，陇西人在吃热凉面，陇南人在吃面皮，天水人出门吃呱呱，在家就着干馍喝罐罐茶......

夜市的热闹被黑夜稀释殆尽，吃早餐的甘肃人平平淡淡，轻言细语，却是一份实在的温情。悠闲的人们，三言两语问候邻里，坐在店里吃完，再捎一份带将出去。分量超足的早餐吃完，甘肃人元气满满的一天，才正式开始。


 早上吃面，“肃面朝天”！
面条在外地，大多拿来当午餐或者晚餐，可甘肃人“固执”地认为，面条在早上口感最佳。兰州牛肉面能成为甘肃美食“一哥”，很大原因就是它在早餐界雷打不动的地位。不过，甘肃绝不只有牛肉面，各地都能看到早上“咥面”的场景，尤其是河西走廊各地，纷纷端出自己的牛肉面“改造款”。



不来个“牛大碗”，这床白起了！
在兰州，公认的主流早餐就三个字：牛肉面，再亲切些，两个字也行——牛大。许多兰州人每天开口说的第一句话，大概都是：“老板，来一碗牛大”！





每天的清晨六点半左右，数以千计的牛肉面馆同时开门营业，黄河两岸的大街小巷里，到处飘荡着牛肉面诱人的香味。
对于兰州人来说，牛肉面是可以私人定制的早餐，“师傅，下个二细，辣子多些蒜苗多…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[肉的质地一直是个神奇的命题。
有的人烧出来的肉软硬适中，有的人照着同样的菜谱却死活做不出来。烧菜的火力、时间，甚至油、淀粉的使用都对肉的质地产生重要的影响。
肉是嫩还是老，核心点是温度，因为它决定了熟肉的2个核心要素：肌纤维的状态和水含量
回到上面这个提问来，我们先来看看肉越炖越烂、越炒越硬背后的原因。
也就是说，温度是怎么影响肉里面肌纤维状态和水含量的？


肉其实是个“水货”，肉重量的70-80%都是水。

可是这个“水货”伪装的特别好，即使它里面大部分是水，你却看不出来。
因为水不会流出来。
为什么不流出来呢？这就跟肌肉的结构有关系了。

肌肉是由一束束肌原纤维组成的，就是上图右上角的Myofibril，水就存在肌原纤维里面。
一般情况下，水是被紧紧包裹在里面的，即使你用力挤也挤不出来。
“时间就像肌肉里的水，你怎么挤也挤不出来”--开尔文
但是，如果肉的温度上升的话，里面的肌球蛋白和肌动蛋白就会因为聚集而失去弹性 (蛋白变性)，这种强悍的储水能力就消失了。

上图是牛肉在不同温度下逐步失水和变硬的过程，总的来说是有两轮的变化。
第一轮变化是在115-120°F (46-49°C)开始的，肉的体积开始缩小，因为肌球蛋白开始变性聚集了；
第二轮变化是在150-163°F (66-73°C) 开始，肉的体积开始进一步缩小，这回是肌动蛋白变性聚集了。
在整个变化的过程中，牛肉中的肌纤维在持续的聚集、收缩，把里面储存的水“挤”了出来。
原来被肌纤维包裹的“非自由水”变成了可以流动的“自由水”。
所以我们在用筷子捅一下半熟的牛排，能看到红色的血水渗出来。

就像上图一样，鸡肉的纤维在加热前是比较饱满的，在水煮或者焙烤后都发生了不同程度的脱水和皱缩。
也就是说，在温度上升时肉在同时经历变熟和变老的过程。
在原理上，食品安全和美味似乎是无法兼得的。
但努力的吃货们总有办法把这两种冲突错开。

比如我们针对肉片的大火爆炒。
在肌肉纤维收缩之前把肉煮熟了，然后在肉汁大量流出之前熄火，尽可能地保留肉片的口感。
但是对于厚度比较大的肉块，这样会增大肉块内外部的温差。
比如，大火煎一块厚牛排的时候，内外部的温差可能会达到40度以上，煎完时可能会出现下图中Blue rare这样的情况。

如果想做成左下角Medium rare这种效果呢？
那就得小火慢煎，将内外部的温差控制在15度以内，这样才比较好达到外焦里嫩的效果。
但是，对于炖煮了一两个小时的肉来说，上面的原理好像不完全适用。
明明已经长时间加热的肉，为什么还能保持不变老呢？
一是因为炖煮时候火候控制的比较好，水的损失比较少；
二是有一种新的物质代替了水，赋予了肉润滑的口感。
它就是结缔组织溶解后产生的明胶


在长时间的炖煮中，捆绑住肌纤维束的结缔组织会发生溶解.
这些新生成的明胶给我们的口腔提供了一种润滑的口感。
但是，被过度加热的明胶同样会被煮干，润滑的作用也会消失。
为什么烧完的肉反复加热会越来越老？
那是因为水和明胶被煮干了，肉变柴了，润滑的口感也消失了。
最典型的例子就是用微波炉加热剩菜。
因为微波炉加热的速度太快、过程中也没法观察，所以一不留神就会出现过度加热的情况。
用微波炉热好的肉菜，尤其是不带汤那种，拿出来时候容易会变得又干又硬。
所以，二次加热时候同样需要注意控制火候，避免过度加热。
这也是烧完的肉反复加热会变老的原因。

总结

温度是影响肉质地的关键，因为它决定这肌纤维的状态和肉的含水量。
温度上升时，肉在同时地变熟和变老。
大火爆炒、小火慢煎、炖煮等方法的恰当使用可以减少肉质变老。
二度加热时候要同样注意，避免过度加热把肉煮硬。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今年国庆期间，我上线了一款用来记录性生活的 App —— Aphrodite，除了因为切中目标用户的需求痛点而获得夸赞之外，我被问到最多的问题就是「为什么要开发这样一款应用」，以及「记录性生活有什么意义？为什么要记录？」。
在我已知的大部分人的观念里，「性生活」都是足够隐秘甚至禁忌的话题，相应地，「记录性生活」也被认为是荒唐之举，因此在 Aphrodite 上线后，我在社媒上照例去「吹嘘」的时候，收获更多的是来自于朋友们的质疑与不理解…… 这也是我写这篇文章的初衷之一，我想聊聊开发 Aphrodite 背后的故事，以及我所理解的「记录性生活的意义」。
关联阅读：派评 | 近期值得关注的 App
Aphrodite 背后的故事
在 Aphrodite 之前，我一直使用 iPhone 自带的健康应用来记录我的性生活，通过快捷指令它可以很便捷地记录性生活发生的时间及是否使用保护措施，但也仅限于此。我用了什么姿势、在哪里发生、时长、是否使用道具等等，一次性生活中值得被记录下来的参数有太多太多，iPhone 自带的健康应用完全无法满足我的需求。而当我尝试在 App Store 搜索后却失望地发现，整个应用商店的几百万 App 里，在做这件事儿的只有寥寥几款 App。
Aphrodite 提供详细的记录功能，甚至贴心地准备了「自慰记录」
在一切都数字化的今天，记录饮水、记录运动的 App 比比皆是，甚至记录排便也可以在 App Store 搜到一长串结果，但同样作为与身体健康密切相关、成人生活中必不可少的重要组成部分，性生活记录的相关应用却少得可怜——这是不合理的。
尽管在立项之初就认识到这一定是一个很小众的 App，甚至能否过审都是未知（后来在提审时确实也经历了各种坎坷），但无论是从自己的需求出发还是本着作为产品经理「想要做一些有意义的产品」的初心，我都不得不把它做出来。
这是我开发…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

前言
关于圣诞，我一直有许多想象，冰岛就是这些想象之中的耶路撒冷。
两年前的今天，我刚刚适应了异国读书的生活，眼看着迎来第一个圣诞长假，思来想去还是决定把目的地设在冰岛。和女友商量一番并试图拉来更多伙伴同行未果后，我们最终决定两人一车自驾游玩。一方面是来读书前开过一段时间车，手还没太生，另一方面觉得不自驾或许会辜负了美景。两年之后回忆起来，这着实是个疯狂而又值得的决定。
因为各种原因，当下出境游玩对大家来说都变得越来越不好实现。也因此，这段冰岛自驾的经历也在我心里愈发闪光。虽然行前做了完备的计划，但我一直没有从头到尾地总结过此事，只零散地发过 一些照片。借着又到圣（re）诞（du），这次好好回顾一下这个近期很难再有的经历。
这篇的属性更接近于攻略而非游记。事实上，少数派上能搜到许多自驾相关内容，@老麦 半年前还非常系统地分享了 西南自驾之旅，特别好特别推荐。这些内容在我整理本篇时帮助都非常大，推荐大家去看看的同时，也感谢各位的分享。
想写这篇的原因也在于，看了这些我发现自己的经验和各位还是有很多不重叠的部分，我也会更侧重地写这些不重叠的、针对冰岛冬季自驾的部分，或许也可以覆盖一些冬季在国内东北、西北的自驾场景。
在读之前，我希望你在脑中能对冰岛冬季自驾有一个大概的轮廓：

冰岛是左舵右行，高速公路只有双向两车道；
城镇密度低，没有太多像样的休息区；
圣诞节前后每天日照时间少于五小时；
冬季海风非常非常大，「风暴」很常见；
天气阴晴不定，雨雪后路面非常滑，时常封路；
……

可能这份攻略你一时半会都还用不上，但我们总有下一个冬天。

This week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[说到「社交牛逼症」，我狼哥必须拥有姓名。
这人上过山，下过海，扛过枪，受过伤，手下百十号兄弟。
而我是个卖家发错货都不愿联系客服退换货的重度「社交恐惧症」患者。
我跟狼先生的感情之所以能维系至今，有两个重要原因：
一是我社恐得连分手都懒得说，二是他牛逼得没工夫搭理我。
1、
我叫小猫，一个长得有一点点儿好看，但命运不咋好看的女子，十八岁那年死过一次，后来又偷活了一生。
现在我三十六岁，在东北某新一线城市的风景区有一栋半山别墅，城区两端共有三套高层河景房，有一辆撒哈拉，一辆大指挥官，一辆指南者。
我这双手曾握过撬棍，抡过扳手，当过修车工，现在我是专职小说作者，大多数时间都在敲键盘，不敢自诩成功，但足以养活自己和自己的爱好。
可因为我至今独自生活，不喜欢与人交流，所以被贴了一身标签，剩女，败犬女，女汉子，单身主义，不婚主义，女权主义，诸如此类，不胜枚举。
其实这些都不是我，我不信奉任何主义，只是单纯地喜欢自由，没有活成这世界对女性定义的样子而已。
我喜欢硬派车，喜欢山河远阔，这是因为我在十八岁那年，傍上了一位四十岁的硬汉大佬。
没错，不是大款，是大佬，有那个社交牛逼症，兄弟一大堆，大的管叫他狼一，小的管他叫老大，我在这里就叫他狼先生。
而我与他初见时没有记忆，所以也没有名字，一切都是后来他给我的。
十八年前我们在一场婚礼上相遇，新郎是他一个兄弟，新娘是一位好心的小姐姐。
小姐姐叫江菲，是个文艺女青年，在济南一所大学门口开书店，通过交笔友爱上了一位兵哥哥杨一帆。
那年杨一帆退役，两人订好了年底结婚，她想招个临时看店的，而我就像个游魂一样，阴差阳错地闯了进来。
江菲说我当时简直惨得不像样，脸色惨白，头上包着绷带，不记得自己是谁，但很饿，急需一个吃饭的地方，隔壁饭店的人说她在招工，我就来了。
江菲胆子真大，不但收留了我，带我去医院换药，还帮我寻找家人，但最终没有结果，于是就在出嫁的时…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[撰文 | 魏水华

头图 | 视觉中国


红烧肉，中国餐桌的绝对主角。无论哪位厨子、无论哪种菜系，当与红烧肉狭路相逢的时候，所有的个性、技法、风格、创意，都要为这道国民大菜妥协让路。红亮、酥糯，五味调和、香气绵长，这是中国菜对红烧肉的共同标准，也是中国人对红烧肉的集体记忆。如果说麻婆豆腐、葱烧海参、白切鸡和蟹粉狮子头，分别代表了川、鲁、粤、淮扬的门面味道，是中国食谱里最受瞩目的四根台柱。那么红烧肉，无疑是凌驾其上的，更重要的国菜栋梁。一沽好酒一盅肉，一江明月一江秋。






No.1 壹
红亮的颜色，是红烧肉最诱人的标签，也是无数人为之垂涎的理由。吊诡的是，提供红烧肉颜色的主要成分：焦糖，却是无味的。无论是冰糖炒制的糖色，还是添加了焦糖的老抽酱油，它们的主要成分，是糖类受热碳化之后产生的焦糖酐(C12H18O9) 焦糖烯 (C36H50O25) 焦糖素(C125H188O80)等有机化合物。






它们几乎不提供人类能吸收利用的有效成分，所以人的味蕾也不易感受到它们的味道——有经验的厨师都知道，熬糖色，有甜味就是火候未到、有苦味就是熬得过头。真正恰到好处的糖色，应该尝不到任何味道。为什么这种无味的天然色素，被添加进平平无奇的炖肉中，却能让人的眼睛主观觉得“好吃”“香”“鲜美”？



其中原因，可能是人类大脑对美拉德反应带来的棕化物质，与焦糖这两种颜色外表相近的有机化合物产生了误判。众所周知，蛋白质是由多个氨基酸，以固定结构组成的肽链。人类只能吸收分散打碎的氨基酸，无法吸收其他生物的蛋白质：这是很多消化功能不好的人，会对部分高蛋白食物产生异体过敏的本质原因。一部分蟹、虾、蚝、贝，即便极简烹饪，或者生吃，也能感受到其中氨基酸鲜甜味，是因为低等生物的蛋白质结构相对简单，白酒、醋、姜蒜等简单腌料和人类的唾液，就能打碎它们的肽链。

SUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh

This week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们通常以抢断和封盖来作为评价一名球员防守能力的指标，如果一个球员能够做到场均抢断封盖1+1，那么他很可能会是个不错的防守人。
​赛季至今，除去那些出场数不足的球员，总共有13人能做到抢断封盖1+1。如果把筛选条件收紧，要求至少抢断1.7+封盖1.1，目前就只有一人达标，那就是76人前锋赛布尔。
精英级别的防守是赛布尔在NBA立足的卖点，而在费城球队无法使用本-西蒙斯的当下，如何让赛布尔发挥能量势必会成为教练组内部讨论的重要议题。
我们也不妨就着这一话题展开讨论，探讨赛布尔使用上的确定性。
从2019年季后赛对位伦纳德以后，西蒙斯就确定了自己防守核心的战术地位。那么在西蒙斯缺席的当下，能否利用赛布尔的防守能力，弥补西蒙斯不在带来的影响？
在给出答案之前，我们或许可以看看赛布尔这赛季在防守端的角色，看看他在防守端都做了些什么事情。
比如在刚结束的对阵篮网的比赛，赛布尔就被指派了单防杜兰特的任务。赛布尔之所以能被赋予如此重要的防守职能，无非是对他防守能力的信赖，而他的能力也有数据支撑：赛季至今，和赛布尔对位的进攻球员平均命中率只有35.4%。



你也可以看到，即便是强如杜兰特，对上赛布尔也很少采用拉开一对一的方式，因为赛布尔足够强壮，可以顶住进攻球员的背身；横移速度够快，也不吃晃，想拉开强突不容易，同时有一对长臂和不俗的瞬间爆发力来干扰进攻球员的投篮，想要一对一占到便宜实在很难。
或许下面这个进攻回合，你可以感受到赛布尔单防的压力：当杜兰特原地干拔投篮，赛布尔顺势举手上前干扰，而他举手干扰的高度是真的可以挡到杜兰特投篮视野的。
杜兰特投篮被干扰的情景，好像不常见吧？



杜兰特当然知道防他的小伙子是个强者，所以他也没有非要用一对一这种吃力不讨好的方式展开进攻。
面对赛布尔的防守，杜兰特更多是采用无球跑动甩开，再接队友的传球攻筐，或者持球利用队友设置的掩护，借此绕开赛布尔的…]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-12-17T15:38:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[电影《雄狮少年》今天终于上映了！从2019年到今天，经过两年多的时间，今天终于要和大家见面了，关于对于这部电影的评价，我想把它交给观众。今天我想跟大家分享一下这部电影一些创作点滴和自己的一些背景。
根据我们故事的风格和特点，我们整个美术风格是偏写实的，卡通程度没有那么高。镜头里的场景，光影，氛围都在尽量还原真实的岭南村庄。而我们的角色必须融入这个环境，没有违和感，而且用他们演绎一个这么烟火气的故事必须可信。
狮头我们完全是按照真实狮头来的，没有加入过多设计，因为我们觉得真实狮头的设计就已经非常经典了。而真实的南派狮头是有多种风格的，因此我们在电影里采用了三种不用造型的狮头：“传统狮头”（陈壮成、年轻时的咸鱼强使用的狮头）“新派狮头”（阿娟使用的狮头）和“鹤山狮头”（无极狮队使用的狮头）


关于人物

刚开始尝试了很多版本，每个角色大概都有7-8稿吧，有些设计是很成熟的，但总觉得没有画出我们心中那种有烟火气的市井的感觉。
后来我们找到了光圈，他的设计风格正好和我们的需求完美契合，每个角色几乎都是第一稿就能确定方向。
最终定版人物形象的原因：小人物的故事、突出小人物的朴素感、结合故事背景是乡村少年、故事中的人物最终也要打破偏见


关于场景

因为我们大部分故事是发生在乡下，所以我们跑遍了广州周边各种村落。
最后我们在顺德找到了两个最符合我们想象的村子：百丈村和北水村，这里有鱼塘，村里的房子就散布在大大小小的鱼塘上，非常漂亮。而且还有一些很有历史的祠堂和老宅子，最重要的是，这里还有很多村民居住，很有生活气息。

有些村子虽然很有历史，但已经变成旅游景点，村民基本已经不在那里生活了，感觉只剩一个壳，没有灵魂了。






然后我团队就开始一遍遍去这两个村子里采风，搜集各种村民生活的细节，还有了解村里的植被，南方乡村的植被是很有特点的，非常丰富。
我们要了解这里植被的种类，墙上的青苔是怎样的，缝隙里的小草是怎样的，有哪些常见的树，怎样分布的。




还有这些植物的四季变化，因为我们故事的时间跨度有一年多，我们的采风也持续了一年。
同时我们还开发了一系列的技术流程去呈现这些内容，为了研究木棉的生长规律，我们特效总监甚至把电脑搬去一棵木棉树下去工作了两天。

最后呈现出来的效果我们都非常满意，观看有些画面时甚至都能闻到村子里的味道。大家都觉得这些付出很值得。


关于舞狮

首先是动作的问题，舞狮有很多技巧，专业性很强，要通过肢体动作去表现狮子各种各样的神态，之前我们是完全不了解的。为了弥补这个问题，我们导演组和动画师特意去专业的舞狮队做了培训，然后才开始设计舞狮相关的动作场面。为了打起来更漂亮，我们还融合了一些武术和舞蹈动作，做了适当的夸张。
然后就是布料和毛发的解算问题，狮子身上的毛发非常多，而且是多层布料解算（舞狮队员身上有衣服，然后外面还要披上狮尾），再加上狮尾复杂的剪裁方式（现代的狮尾结构很复杂，中间还加了橡皮筋增加弹性，在舞狮的时候可以伸缩）是一个非常复杂的系统工程。我们都一一作了仔细的研究和测试，最终在三维软件中模拟出完美的动态。
最后就是渲染，毛发渲染一向是三维渲染中最耗时的工作之一，一两头狮子还好。但我们的决赛有130多头狮子出现，现场看台上有1800多个观众，再加上公园里围观的1000多名游客，还有大量茂密的植被......想想就是一件很可怕的事情，最初我们都不确定能不能渲染出来，我们做了大量的研究和开发工作才能保证决赛镜头的顺利渲染。
我们这部电影在条件有限的情况下，大家都憋足了一口气要做最棒的作品，这种感觉太棒了，能和他们一起创作是我的荣幸。

要特别说一句的是我们音乐总监栾慧，他为了这部作品推掉了很多工作，专门从东北老家来到广州在我们楼下宾馆里搭建了一个工作室和我们一起工作了半年多，所以这次我们的音乐和画面契合度非常高，因为我随时都能下楼和他一起讨论关于音乐的想法，而且他随时都能上楼看到我们最新的画面，甚至有很多重要戏份的剪辑都是根据他的音乐，我和他一起做了精确的调整，达到音乐和画面的完美匹配。
而且我们在制作中经历了疫情封锁，我们公司所在的芳村正好处于疫情中心，一夜之间整个区域停止一切活动，我们只能居家办公，也因此导致了制作的延期，当时的绝望情绪现在还历历在目，还好政府迅速控制住了疫情，而我们也利用这次延期的机会做了一些很重要的修改，让我们的作品更进一步，也算是因祸得福吧。
   很荣幸这一路遇到了很多志同道合的朋友们，也感谢那些与我们素未谋面的观众们的喜爱和支持。希望更多人也能关注到我们国产原创动画，也希望中国传统文化被更多年轻人追逐。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想来聊点背后的故事。或许有生之年很难再遇上像2020东京奥运一样的情形了（也别再来了）。
 备赛四年变五年。记不清是央视采访哪位运动员来着，她说，“那天一早去训练馆，瞅着倒计时牌从100多天跳成了400多天。一下泄了劲儿，特崩溃”。100%的真实回应，不分项目，也无关国籍。
就我而言，多出来的一年，比前面四年难得多的多。撇开年龄和体能，最大的顾虑是家庭。因为疫情，得全封闭训练。其实我家就住天津，离不远的，两个女儿都还小外加老人，本是最需要我的时候，担子却全落在了妻子身上。
艳子曾经也是一名举重运动员，所有的纠结和挣扎她最懂。后来，她反倒跑来宽慰我说，“就暂时把你交给国家了。（其他）别担心。”这话，是真扎到我心里了，同时也是继续坚持的最大动力。
 说回备战，变化很多。先是时隔20年首次级别调整。我那会考虑到岁数大之后你降体重，肯定对各方面有影响。索性打81，上了4公斤。但实际上，我和余导对把增加的体重转换成更稳定的技术这方面，什么经验都没有。
 东奥最棘手还有个什么呢，是国际举联修改的新积分规则，要求必须在2018年11月-2020年4月的三个比赛区间内完成6站积分赛。相当于每两个月就得打一次高强度比赛。就这段时间，我遭遇了生涯内最艰难的一场比赛。也是给自己逼到绝境的一场。
 2019年9月的泰国芭提雅积分赛，决定拿不拿得到东奥入场券的关键比赛。抓举我开把是165，有点着急了，往前迈了两步掉了，把腰扭了。一个小关节的错位，当时没感觉太出来。第三把，我和小14岁的队友李大银都抓了171。一切就看挺举了。
 两项间歇时，身体反应就显出来了。动不了，腰肌一下子缩到一团，弯腰都弯不下去。没办法，只能把挺举第一把从计划的200降到191，想着先保个总成绩吧。杠一扔，痛感爆发，走路都走不了，人被架着下场了。
当时余导过来劝，要不放弃吧，别把身体搞坏了。怎么说呢，没来及想什么多的，就一条，不想放弃每一把，边趴着敷冰袋边回：“不可能，确实不能（弃）”。完了第二把直接加到了205。因为是最高重量，可以等全部人举完再上，也算是战术给自己换多点休息时间。
 205，是刷新世界纪录的重量。完全是咬死了牙才撑起来的。杠一扔，人就往一边歪了，勉强没倒地。没多久，大银最后一把举过了206，二刷纪录。当时全场就剩我的第三把，顶了个207。这是一个我从来没有在国际比赛上挑战过的重量，但能不能去东京就此一举了。再怎么疼，也不想留遗憾，必须再试一把，给它拼了！

要说犹没犹豫过腰伤呢，也犹豫，但一上台感觉就来了。也不是纯说胜负欲吧，就是想把最好的一面展现给全世界热爱举重的人看。我是真喜欢台上的感觉。
 说到胜负欲，对2016年的里约奥运，是有的。五年来继续坚持的理由，有它一份，想再较量一把，还是有那么点不服气吧。
 说个东奥决赛开场前的小插曲，也是后来少见开把没成的教训。权当给大伙避雷。
 那会中国举重队已经收了三个级别的冠军，我是有压力的。后台区就一直在调情绪，调着调着感觉要爆棚了，还跑去跟余导提“要不开抓170吧”。没同意，依旧165，完了没带起来（兴奋过头随意了）。下场余导很严肃说要重视，我也跟自己说：“就两把了，不能再乱来了。”静下来一步步想动作，怎么带，怎么展。抓举成绩稳在了170。

 挺举开把实话说有瞬间，闪过了2016年的画面。抬杠那下，还是有点害怕掉了的，咬牙硬顶。197一过，心态就完全放开了。第二把204，从握杠就憋足了气，完事锁定金牌后，是有点小喜悦的，趁着斗志又报了210。翻站的时候调铃没有调好，稍微歪了点，丢了。有点可惜。
 评价什么的不敢讲，比赛很享受，但过程真的很难很难。最想说的是，这份荣誉不光属于个人，而是实实在在地属于整个中国举重队。
 我是吕小军，一个像热爱生命一样热爱举重的中国人。

——写于国重成立十周年
计算机体系结构国家重点实验室（以下简称国重）成立十年了，这是一个里程碑。在脑海中回忆着和国重相关的事，一幕幕场景浮现，甚至包括2003年第一次到计算所参加研究生复试的场景。那时，计算所历经沧桑的大门还在，而自己还是一张科研白纸，不知道如果被计算所录取了，将来会在这里干什么。幸运的是跌跌撞撞地通过计算所的面试，正式成为一名“计算所人”，从此开启了科研人生，也开始认识和体会计算所的使命感。
在和国重相关的众多回忆中，有一句话反复浮现：“总要有人去做一些不同的事”。这是国重主任孙凝晖院士平日里和大家交流时对使命感的一种通俗的解读——当大多数人都去做相同的事、都去追求相同的东西时，国重要鼓励和支持有人去做一些不同的事。我是国重这种发展理念的积极响应者，也是这种理念的最大受益者之一，我的成长就是去做了不同阶段国重所鼓励的、和主流有点不同的事。
（一）
2006年以前，计算所的系统方向一直都是专注于承担龙芯、曙光这样的大项目。但从2006年起，计算所开始重视在计算机体系结构基础研究上布局。于是在2006年，国重的前身——中科院计算机系统结构重点实验室（院重）成立了。那时国内还是SCI论文盛行，时任计算所所长的李国杰院士认为不应该追求SCI论文，而是呼吁要重视在国际顶级会议上发表论文。
明确了方向和目标，大家的努力便开始逐渐起成效了：2006年、2007年先后突破了计算所第一篇SC和SPAA，2008年又突破了HotChips、SIGMETRICS、ICS，2009年顶会论文又上一个台阶（HPCA、SC、ICS、DSN、2篇CGO），2010年继续一路高歌（2篇ISCA、PLDI、HPCA、3篇CGO等）……
那段时间我也是积极响应，把发表顶会论文作为目标，也有所收获，在2008年发表了SIGMETRICS，2010年发表了HPCA，也因…]]></summary>

本周话题：音乐是反社交
Spotify 的前产品经理有一天在推特发言，总结自己这些年在音乐行业的心得。
第一条心得就很震撼。
"本质上，音乐不是社交产品，而是反社交的。"

我看到以后，愣了一下，马上意识到，这句话说得太对了。音乐和社交是对立的，音乐产品不合适加入社交功能。
听音乐的时候，绝大多数都是一个人，而且都是静静地听，没人喜欢在吵闹的环境听。音乐是一种心灵对话，是孤独时候的陪伴，不具有社交性。

聚会时，大家不会一起听音乐。音乐从来不是社交活动，相比之下，美食、逛街、旅游、甚至看电影，这些才是社交行为，一个人去做没有乐趣。
音乐不具有社交性，还有一个原因，那就是很少有人对你听什么音乐感兴趣。你真的在意，朋友喜欢听哪一首歌吗？
因此，音乐产品应该是个人化产品，关注的重点是个人使用，而不应该加入社交元素。
世界最大的两个音乐应用 Spotify 和 Apple Music 都没有社交元素，界面都很清爽，几乎没有听音乐以外的功能。


它们有全世界最庞大的用户群，最精准的兴趣匹配算法，却没有提供任何的交友和社区功能。这是他们的产品经理没有想到，还是觉得就不应该添加这种功能？
形成鲜明对照的是，国内的音乐大厂"网易云音乐"，主打功能就是社交。打开它的 App，处处都有社交元素，可以查看每首歌的网友点评，收听他人的歌单和电台，还可以加好友、聊天、建社交圈。

网易云音乐的官方定位是"一个快速发展的云生态音乐社区"，口号是"和超8亿有趣的人听歌看…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[新晋网红店铺开了一茬又一茶，北京很少是首选，搞得饱妹经常只能眼馋上海的朋友，偷偷留下羡慕的口水泪水。


这次盼星星盼月亮，终于盼来了长沙代表队的中式点心店：虎头局渣打饼行。于是网红拔草栏目回归！跟着福桃，让你好汉不吃网红亏！





饱情提示：本文全程无广，可放心食用。
虽然饱妹买得多，架不住饱弟吃得也多啊！
（都吃完了，没浪费的意思）
和大多把选址锁定在三里屯周边的店铺不同，虎头局的北京首店选在了五棵松华熙LIVE，从五棵松地铁站B口出来，穿过“灯红酒绿”的走廊，直达五棵松华熙LIVE。





汤城小厨的广告牌如同饱妹寒冷冬日里的一盏明灯，看见它便是找到了对的方向，进入旁边的门，虎头局渣打饼行就在左手边。





饱妹到店门口的时间是工作日的10：23，店内外加起来仍排了十个人左右，跟游乐园一样的S型排队通道还未开启。





▲恰好在饱妹点单时，后面进来了一位免排队的孕妇
通道内摆放有“孕妇免排队”的标志牌，队尾有店员负责测温和扫码的工作，还有一份菜单供顾客提前了解产品。





店门口陈列着菜单中在售的点心，饱妹问过店员后得知：这些点心都不是模型，而是和售卖的点心同批出炉的产品，葡挞、盘挞和白玉卷这类原材娇弱的会每日更换，其余则是通过外貌来判断当日是否更换，展示品不会进行售卖（想到销毁有点心疼）。





饱妹观察买到手的顾客，基本都是一大袋子起步，两大袋子是标配，颇有置办年货的气势。饱妹点完单的时间是10：51，店门外开始使用S型通道进行排队，除了菜单外，还有店员在队列中分发“预点单”和为顾客提供建议，节省在点单处的时间。





▲人多时会使用的预点单
拿到点心的顾客也许是因为经历了排队和装袋的等待，都会先掏出手机给点心拍照，喜悦之情溢于言表，颧骨升天说明了一切。









▲就算戴着口罩打了码也能感受到他们的快乐
点完单可以在店的周围等…]]></summary>

While being on a steady rise for years, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased reported cases of poor mental health significantly. KFF reports that the implications of the pandemic have resulted in 4 in 10 adults reporting symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog post, we will learn how to build a TypeScript util type, that exposes all the key paths of an object, including the nested ones.
Have you ever built TypeScript function that receives a specific property of an object, by specifying the object and the path to that object's property? Something like this:
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  dog:{
    name: "Rex",
  }
}

function get<ObjectType>(object: ObjectType, path: string){
  const keys = path.split('.');
  let result = object;
  for (const key of keys) {
    result = result[key];
  }
  return result;
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.
let us look at an example

let person = {};

person.name = "David";
person.age = 45;

person.eat = function() {
console.log(`person is eating`);
}

Here we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.

When you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.
So the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.
When a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:
Returns undefined (if you tried to access a property).
Throws an error (if you tried to call a method).]]></summary>

When I started making Chrome Extensions, they were small projects for clients who wanted to automate a task. I was starting a new Chrome Extension almost every week, and it took too much time to configure a new project. Then I thought, "We already have a manifest; why do we need more config files?"
That's the idea behind rollup-plugin-chrome-extension, also known as RPCE. My name is Jack Steam, and I've been hard at work over the last few months adding Vite support to RPCE. So today, I'm excited to invite you to try out RPCE with Vite.

Branding yourself online has become increasingly important as landing a role in the tech industry is constantly getting more competitive. If you want to freelance, creating a personal brand is the absolute best way to land roles, but it’s still important for those of us looking to gain more traditional roles. Creating a strong online presence that is clearly branded will help employers and clients understand exactly what you can do for them. It will also create a strong sense of skill and authenticity, as well as display your communication skills. Plus, it’s a great way to network.

We’re not going to deeply examine Fielding's definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn't RESTful. Instead, we’ll take a simplified view and concern ourselves with how RESTful APIs are understood in web applications.
One convention is to create the unique address for resources by combining the name of the resource type with the resource's unique identifier.

Even though this will mention tools and techniques specific to React, a fair amount of this would transfer to general-purpose optimization work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个原因其实非常简单：
如果你看过2017年，ssg夺冠之路，我相信你也会非常喜欢这支队伍。
如果各位刚好有时间，我就凭记忆回顾一下S7都发生了什么，然后你就明白为什么管泽元（包括我）喜欢ssg，喜欢crown了
本身2017年我也是全年在看LCK，一场不落，而管泽元也经常去解说lck的比赛。我们都见证并经历了SSG的传奇！（这个教练非常厉害 ，还有替补haru是狮子狗本命，据说只拿狮子狗上王者，后来我记得很多lck比赛他拿狮子狗必赢的，这就叫本命英雄）

三星是S7的3号种子，可以说是从悬崖下又爬上来的，一路过关斩将，拿到了最后一个名额，为了拿这个名额，不容易，都是劲敌，但时间久远，我忘了都是什么队了，反正都很厉害。
补充：鉴于很多朋友比较关心，我查询并记起了当年ssg拿三号种子的大致过程。
2017年的lck是SSG，AFS，MVP三支队伍打冒泡赛，其中的胜者再和kt打，才能获得最后一个名额。
当时LZ一号种子，SKT二号种子。然后ssg赢了afs和mvp中的胜者后（我印象中好像是afs赢了），还要和kt再打才有资格拿到三号种子。而kt众所周知是当时的银河战舰，看看这豪华阵容：
smeb是当时世界第一上单，即便在s8也能按着duke杀，和巅峰the shy打得有来有回。打野score是老牌野王了，中路是刚从edg回去的佛祖pawn将军，下路飞行员deft+号称最强大脑的曾获得S4世界冠军的fmvp获得者mata。当时kt还有个笑话，叫LPL三杰，意思是：从LPL回来的三个都是菜逼（pawn，mata，deft），全靠smeb和老队长在c

再看看afs有多强？SKT刚拿下三冠，风头正盛，lck也是当之无愧第一赛区，而当时afs是全世界对skt胜率最高的队伍！比抗韩奇侠闪电狼还高不少！我记得那年春季赛afs遇到skt基本没输过，把我看蒙了，心想马大头打老东家是真滴狠。

        <updated>2021-12-15T12:23:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。

与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。

虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。



游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。



《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。
最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。
说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。

虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每年的下半年是各种考试的密集区——对于学生党来讲是一年之中的大考，考个好分数，开心好过年；而对于职场人来讲，下半年，各类的专业技术能力考试与职业资格考试充斥，而且不少公司内部也有各种形式的让人开心的内部测验。
但凡是场考试，基本上都是绕不过去的。只有考和考，这样一个选项，所以备考的功课多多少少是要做的。
然而工作了之后，每天真正能够用于学习的时间却是非常少的。而当有了结婚生子之后，可利用的时间又会在非常少的基础之上，再度减少。做点属于自己的事情就要见缝插针。
针对这样的情况，结合我自身的经历，我对自己学生时代的备考方法进行一下调整，在备考过程中用起来还不错。我就把它整理了一下，于是就有了这篇分享。这当中的部分做法不仅可以用在备考之中，也可以用于其他笔记记录。
我的方法主要包括两部分，一是基于 A4 稿纸基础之上的笔记整理，另一个是基于错题整理基础之上的知识体系重构。
我整理的一本备考笔记，类似的我还有好几本
关于考试与测验
我们日常参加的各种考试一般分为两种：一种是测试过关能力测试，一种是选拔人头。感兴趣的可以去了解效标参照性标准体系与常模参照性指标体系。
为了便于理解，这里举个栗子。老师组织了一场考试，60 分及以上视为合格，分数最高的人可以获得一等奖。这里「60 分及以上视为合格」就是属于前者，完成通关任务就行；而「一等奖」这种大事一般来讲只会有一个人，无论难易。听到规则之后，每个人都会根据自身的情况进行评判并作出相应的决策，或是稍微躺平，或是努力奋斗。
讲这个的主要目的其实就是，我们的时间与精力是有限的，对于那些属于过关类的考试不要全部押宝上去，合理分配，以实现相对最优的投入产出比。
考试，不管是四六级考试、研究生考试，还是职业资格考试、专业技术资格考试（职称考试）都会有各种各样的辅导班。不少人也会去选择报名这样的辅导班。当然无论辅导班是否对自己的考试有助力，最终的考…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows 11 带来了全新的视觉、听觉体验和不少令人耳目一新的功能。不出所料的是，这些更新还搀杂了各种全新的 Bug 和特性。当然这似乎是一种潮流：几家科技巨头都热衷于在发布会和宣传片上炫耀新功能，却留下各类恼人的 Bug 或「特性」供开发人员修复到猴年马月。更何况 Windows 只占微软整体收入一小部分，市场中又没有任何产品足以与之竞争，指望微软官方短时间内有动力提供更好的系统体验太过不切实际。
不过使用 Windows 时的遇到诸多不顺自有应对之道。如果你苦恼于莫名宕机的开始菜单，存在感极强但作用不大的 Teams 和小组件，亦或者愤满于微软高筑的软件迁移门槛，那么下面的这些技巧或许能帮助到你。部分技巧同样适用于 Windows 10。
通过文件和链接类型更换默认浏览器
是的，更换默认浏览器竟然再次成为了需要拿出来说的东西。
如果你是从 Windows 10 升级到 Windows 11，那么你的浏览器设置将会被保留。而如果你的 Windows 11 为全新安装，现在想从 Edge 切换到其他的浏览器，在目前（22000.348）版本中，你会发现原来的「默认程序」界面不再提供切换默认浏览器功能。这显然是为了提高用户从 Edge 迁出的门槛。

现版本如果想要切换某浏览器为默认，需要更多的步骤。假设我们想要将 Liberwolf 设定为默认浏览器，需打开设置面板，进入 应用 > 默认应用 > Liberwolf，将 .html、.htm、HTTP 和 HTTPS 四个条目设置为 Liberwolf。

微软的这种举动倒逼部分厂商做出回应。从官网下载的 Firefox 用户目前可直接的浏览器设置中将 Firefox 设置为默认。Windows 应用商店中 Firefox 则无此功能。
可能由于 Brave、Chrome 等浏览器团队的 抗议，近日 发布的预览版本 W…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[和 Android 系统一样，很多 Android 应用也会选择将源码进行开放，一方面供开源社区对代码进行审查保证安全性，另一方面也能「集思广益」，经其它开发者之手发展、演变出更多有意思的代码分支和功能。
更重要的是，因为源码人人可获取，当这些应用的商店版本（如 Play 商店）因为各种原因更新缓慢，或原始分支不再维护时，我们也可以直接绕过商店、借助源码编译「原汁原味」的最新版本。
本文就为大家介绍一种相对简单、能够自给自足的 Android 应用编译方法。
自己编译应用需要哪些工具？
要想编译 Android 项目，首先我们就先来看看项目源码的一般目录结构，了解我们需要一些什么样的编译工具。

编程语言：2021 年 Android 项目主要支持的编程语言是 Java 和 Kotlin。两者语言都是运行在 JVM 环境中，都需要各自的编译器 javac 和 kotlinc 把源码编译为 JVM 的字节码。
包管理器：Android 项目常见的包管理器是 Gradle，它负责管理和下载项目的第三方依赖，并且构建出可安装运行的 Android 安装包 (apk)。
开发套件：开发套件在图中是一个隐藏的依赖 —— Android SDK 。在大部分的平台架构上开发 GUI 程序，基本绕不开平台的 SDK。
至此，我们了解清楚了我们所需要的工具，那么下一个问题就是从哪里获取这些工具。
传统编译方法比较麻烦在哪里？
传统的办法编译 Android 项目是下载 Android Studio 集成开发环境，作为一个 IDE 它包含了上述所需要的全部的工具，但是它也有以下的弊端：

从 Android Studio 下载指定的 Android SDK 版本也还需要一定的步骤
Android Studio 自带的 Java 版本较新，不一定能编译通过旧代码
Gradle 下载依赖的时候由于…]]></summary>

Android 12L Beta 1 发布

本周，Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本已经发布，但其实 Android 12L 对于大部分 Android 爱好者其实也都不算太陌生：毕竟如果你有仔细看周报的话，上一次提到 Android 12L，大家想到的可能都是关于 Google 折叠屏手机项目（又称 Pixel Fold）搁浅的新闻。

 
但作为 Android 12L 的首个 Beta 测试版本，我们还是可以借此了解更多 Android 12L 中的新特性：毕竟除了面向大屏/高 DPI 显示所做的优化之外，Android 12L 本身也有「Android 12.1」这一另一层含义，因此也包括一些对于原生 Android 12 使用体验上的改进。

在 UI 细节上，Android 12L 为了应对大屏使用，类似壁纸设置 UI 等二级菜单都采用了浮窗而非先前的全屏设计，最近应用页面中的「清除所有应用」按钮也加上了 Android 12L 风格的圆角矩形边框，很多 UI 操作细节都变得更加顺滑自然；符合 Android 12 整体对于 UI 动效的调整风格。触觉反馈的调整也更加柔和，这些本身都是 Pixel 系列的强项，Android 12L 中只是进一步优化了体验细节。

另外，在 Android 12 正式版中没有的投…]]></summary>

Since I work as a developer, it seems easy to find someone else with a technical background. And that's how I met your... my co-founder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. 
Our mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future. Join our platform to learn more about what opportunities Interniac can offer you!

There's been a lot of hand-wringing about how open source software, the lifeblood of many businesses today, is often totally unpaid and unthanked work, with some hot takes like 'Open source needs to grow the hell up.' and 'Open source' is broken.
What I want to touch on is something that's been bothering me for the past few days, and solidified after seeing Bloomberg's piece–the fact that the log4j developers had this massive security issue dumped in their laps, with the expectation that they were supposed to fix it.

Nicolas Cage stars as... Nick Cage in the action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones. With a career built for this very moment, the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nick Cage.]]></summary>

The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy.

Since databases are used in many different applications and support multiple platforms, devices, and users, there may be differences in how data is entered, even in a simple field like a phone number.
For example, one set of users will enter the phone number with the country code, while the others may simply ignore the country code. Therefore, it is essential for database users to know how to clean data in a SQL database. In this post, we will see how to utilize SQL string operations on phone number fields to properly clean, format, and extract data.

Of course, I watched a lot of tutorials during my learning journey, and I still do to gain more knowledge about certain things and improve my skills on a daily basis.
But even as I'm watching and following along with the tutorial, I'm already taking in the good things I could use from that tutorial in my head and thinking about how I could use them in one of my own projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[便利店无美食推荐指南
比如总是被“夸”的便利店便当


好像大家对便利店盒饭总是有莫名的期待
而全家、711、罗森的便当，鸡腿、猪排、意面…
从外表看，确实让人很有食欲


这么多肉，却只卖十几块
花很少的钱，就能吃饱又吃好



“世界上竟然有这种好事儿”
当这个想法出现时
故事的走向一般都是
“果然没有这种好事儿”



2年多前，胖崽做过一次全家便当的差测评
这次我又用了大概一周的时间
吃了全家所有的便当



你们觉得这些好看的便当皮囊下
有几款藏着“好吃”的灵魂


西式口味饭

芝士猪排咖喱饭、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭、黑椒香煎猪排饭
这三款饭，无论名字还是卖相
看上去，都觉得真香
…
但眼见就一定为实吗
那我追过的cp，就不会怎么看都真的是爱
实际却根本不存在



1、芝士猪排咖喱饭

13块8
与2年前比，猪排口感有进步
虽然同样比较干，但更像“肉”了
味道依然完全不像肉，吃出了点咸味



猪排勉强能吃，咖喱真的难吃
全家，你是在画咖喱吗
颜色像咖喱，味道跟咖喱根本不相关
吃起来很奇怪，味道很复杂
有点点奶，有点点咸，完全不下饭



2、奥尔良整只鸡腿饭

15块8
这个皮，感觉应该烤箱再烤20分钟
而不是微波炉加热就能吃
唉，这是鸡腿皮，又不是脸皮
为什么我也想不要呢



本来鸡腿够大，还有甜味香肠
这款饭吃起来还挺饱，挺满足
但，饭里又加了同款怪味咖喱
这个咖喱吃起来的感觉
真的让我误会是不是加了恒河水
复杂、一言难尽



3、黑椒香煎猪排饭

12块8
啊，这猪排，真的成了精
我这凡人之躯，确实感受不出猪的原型
不知道自己在吃什么肉



但粉丝跟豆角味道还算正常
有蛋味跟油味的煎蛋
是全家盒饭里，最好的荤菜



中式口味饭

西式的饭不太行，吃吃看中式口味



1、香冒肥牛饭

14块8
来，你们看看这片肉
隔着屏幕，吃不到，是不是很难受
那我们感同身受
…
因为我看着这片肥牛
却也吃不出肥牛的味道



味道偏辣
对于广东胃来说，是非常辣
比较下饭吧



2、孜然牛肉鸡排双拼饭

奥尔良鸡肉、孜然牛肉、蛋皮、甜洋葱、胡萝卜…
聚在一起，什么都有
然后，每一款都做得不怎么样
这不是盒饭，是饭堂
即使只卖15块8，我也觉得不值



烩饭

烩饭是全家新款便当
一盒13块8
两款都比较清淡


菌菇鸡肉烩饭

味道像清鸡汤味的浓汤宝


番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭

基本就是微微的酸味
可以吃吧



面
吃完了饭，我们来吃面
一共吃了5款
包含意面、拌面、泡面、不知道什么面

其实都不用说出口
煮好，冷藏，微波炉再加热吃的面条
这是做好了，等ta，等到冷掉的饭菜
确实热热还能吃，但就是吃得不开心啊
所有的面条口感都很糟糕，大部分很软





1、奥尔良风味鸡肉意面

11块8
这盒面，要上天



“您好，这是本次航班配送的餐食”



完全就是经济舱鸡肉意面的样子跟味道
鸡肉就是飞机餐鸡肉口感
调味酸酸甜甜
只有翱翔在蓝天，才愿意下咽



2、大块鸡排京味炸酱干拌面

11块8
本来炸鸡排的口感应该是：说出“我喜欢你”前一刻的心跳
热切，跳个不停
用微波炉翻热的炸鸡排
…
是听到“对不起”后一刻的心跳
心如死灰的静
…
完全不香
京味炸酱就吃出了咸


3、港式餐蛋捞丁

这11块8，花得不值
午餐肉，薄到，我都害怕
它会从我的牙缝溜走
…
唯一的优点是捞丁用的酱
有蒜蓉，所以味道没那么单调



4、黑椒牛肉炒意面

只要9块8
所以买不了吃亏买不了上当
诶诶诶，想啥呢
不该花的钱一分不能花
这盒面，很干，还只吃出黑胡椒的冲辣



5、黑椒牛柳拌面

最好，也最贵，13块8
虽然主要也是黑胡椒味
但酱汁拌匀后，面条比较湿润，口感会好一些




总 结
分量来说，全家的盒饭
大部分一个都吃不饱



非要选的话，如果旁边没有超市快餐
饭我选番茄鸡蛋牛肉烩饭
面的话，嗯，不如选便利店里的车仔面


最后，发自内心地说
其实全家的便当非常适合我吃
因为社畜，就该吃些非人的食物




这次重测，一大原因是上次测评发出后的回应，让那篇测评可以归入“我找骂系列测评”。
所以这期，我先“反击”



以上纯味道评价，你可以认为好吃，但别用“加班后深夜的全家”等附加情感因素反驳我；
因为用“感情”反击，从“道理”上，就已经输了

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不久前某刚到深圳的工友咨询深圳有无「正常」的披萨，就是只有番茄奶酪罗勒烤出来的，没有那些稀奇古怪顶料的简单披萨，大家推荐了许多店但几乎都不能完全满足这看似没有需求的需求。而我认为大家既然都已经是成熟的大人了，不妨自给自足？
有人戏说披萨就是中式馅饼的变种——它把馅儿给裹在了饼外面，或许是因为这个原因，以必胜客为主的中低端披萨店会给其做一些莫名其妙的改良，什么咖喱、麻辣甚至烤鸭披萨都常能见到，反而一些最基础的传统披萨被隐藏在菜单角落，并且味道也非常一般。
尝试过在家制作一次披萨后，大概猜到那些莫名其妙的「创意披萨」或许并不全是为了迎合中式饮食的噱头，而是基础披萨虽然制作简单并且食材普通，但它却非常需要耐心——而这往往是普通披萨店成本最高的地方。所以我想通过这篇文章和你分享如何在家自制披萨，我想你应该能学会，而我相信当你吃过这块「一点都不快」的披萨之后，再也对街边的披萨店提不起任何兴趣。
哪种披萨最好吃
当看到我说「在家自制披萨」时，想必你一定满头问号——做什么披萨？且不论前文提到出现在国内各个快餐店里稀奇古怪的创意披萨，就算是所谓的「传统披萨」，也分为美式披萨和意式披萨两大流派，再往下根据不同国家不同城市的流行饮食文化还演变出了各式各样的风味披萨，我不知道这世上有没有字面意思上「吃过所有披萨」的人，但我估计我这辈子都做不到。
所以在知道披萨种类其实非常丰富之后，我也和你一样问过同样的问题：哪种披萨最好吃？而现在其实我和工友一样只喜欢「正常披萨」，也就是那不勒斯披萨。
那不勒斯披萨从某种意义上你可以把它理解为意大利披萨的一种，它起源于意大利的那不勒斯，并且是受到了意大利官方承认和保护的饮食，类似于我们常听到的「非物质文化遗产」。而在 1984 年成立的「那不勒斯披萨认证协会（ACPN, Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana）」更是把那不勒斯披萨推…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[记者从退役军人事务部了解到，退役军人事务部近日正式印发《退役军人、其他优抚对象优待证管理办法（试行）》（以下简称《优待证管理办法》）。
《优待证管理办法》指出，为规范退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象优待证（简称优待证）制发、使用和服务管理，维护持证人权益，提高优待服务管理水平，依据《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》和国家有关规定，制定本办法。
《优待证管理办法》明确，优待证分为“中华人民共和国退役军人优待证”、“中华人民共和国烈士、因公牺牲军人、病故军人遗属优待证”两种，分别面向符合条件的退役军人和烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属等其他优抚对象发放。优待证是持证人彰显荣誉的载体、享受优待的凭证。
据了解，2020年1月，退役军人事务部等20部门联合印发《关于加强军人军属、退役军人和其他优抚对象优待工作的意见》，提出“建立优待证制度”，逐步为退役军人和“三属”（烈士遗属、因公牺牲军人遗属、病故军人遗属）统一制作颁发优待证。2021年1月1日起施行的《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》，将国家发放优待证写入法律。
《优待证管理办法》共9章、52条，3个部分。第一部分为总体要求，包含第一、二章，共16条。明确了优待证制发的目的依据、相关定义、适用范围、工作原则、信息支持、职责分工、功能等。
第二部分为优待证各个环节的工作要求，包含第三至八章，共32条。明确了申请、审核、制发、补换、收回、监督管理等全周期过程的要求。
第三部分为附则，即第九章，共4条。明确了遗属界定、施行时间等。（人民网记者何淼）

DSM 7.1
在过去的 2021 年，群晖正式发布了近年来其 DSM 操作系统最大的一次版本更新：DSM 7.0。全新的外观、更为安全的访问以及诸多系统新特性使得群晖 NAS 在更可靠安全的同时，也变得更为易用。而在 2022 年，群晖还会基于 DSM 7.0 推出其首个功能更新：DSM 7.1，主要聚焦在以下几个使用痛点上：
管理大规模部署
在 DSM 7.0 中，群晖发布了基于共有云的 web 端监控平台 Active Insight，你可以通过这个平台有效地了解到你的 NAS 设备的运行情况，而在 DSM 7.1 中，Active Insight 将会得到进一步的增强，比如说你可以用它来对多台设备进行大规模的集约化部署，统一管理系统更新和套件软件的更新。

同时在 Active Insight 还整合了更为智能的验证系统，可以根据使用习惯还预测并判断潜在的可疑登录，尤其是当登录地点和时间变得异常或者所有用户账户突然变成活动状态时，会及时通知 Active Insight 的管理员，并提供相对应的操作建议。

另外 Active Insight 还将加入监控 Hyper Backup 备份任务，这样对于需要管理多台设备的管理员，可以在一个界面下集中管理而无需手动检查每一台设备。进一步减少检查和管理的工作量。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在国内定制系统几乎都已经经历过一轮变革的 2020 年年底，横空出世的 OriginOS 虽然难免给人一种「来晚了」的感觉，彼时它所交出的答卷依然让人惊喜，而如果站在现在的角度去看当时的 OriginOS，则不难发现它在启动器布局、桌面微件（widget）和自定义风格上的改造思路和实现路径甚至还有那么几分预见性：桌面微件在 iOS 和 Android 生态内重新得到重视、个性化表达在 Android 12 中成为一大主题……
OriginOS 对启动器主屏的重构令人印象深刻
2021 年，华容网格、原子组件、变形器，这几个在 OriginOS 中让人眼前一亮并迅速成为堪称 vivo 手机标志性功能的特性，又将迎来哪些打磨和创新？
12 月 9 日刚刚亮相的 OriginOS Ocean，就像它跳出常规「版本号」框架的命名方式那样，又一次在定制系统阵营中吹起了这么一阵新风。
玩转「符号」，将系统做成一本杂志
对去年少数派发布的 OriginOS 评测还有印象的朋友，应该知道 OriginOS 当初在大刀阔斧改造 vivo 手机系统桌面启动器的同时，也留下了不少让人担心的小问题，其中最明显的自然是系统整体设计风格上的割裂：华容网格和原子组件构建的新体验需要大量的第三方适配进行支撑、变形器虽然做得非常细致但依然没有处理好一些设计细节、启动器之外的其它部分缺少与之配位的打磨和润色……
关联阅读：OriginOS 上手体验：三个概念与它们所对应的问题
归根结底，虽然 OriginOS 在华容网格、原子组件等概念上极具巧思，但它们需要一套能够将整个 OriginOS 统一起来的设计语言。在我看来，这正是 vivo 在 OriginOS Ocean 中引入符号化设计语言的原因。这套符号化设计语言的理念源自杂志，参考对象的选择依然很巧妙——和大部分需要仔细阅读、浏览的内容相似，用排版设计的…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

背景概述
每次我想打盹儿的时候，几乎百分百会被媳妇的电话闹醒，但是困的时候老是忘记提前给媳妇打招呼，然后就被一阵巨大的响铃给震醒，导致不愉快。很多时候连勿扰模式也忘记开，还会被其它骚扰电话和钉钉电话闹醒。
最近研究了一下 iOS 15 推出的专注模式，结合日常生活场景做了这么个快捷指令，顺便把制作方法分享一下。
功能场景说明：运行后，手动选择计划小憩时长 30 分钟或其它时长，同时设置一个 30 分钟闹钟，发送一段文字内容通过短信和微信的方式通知给媳妇，时间到了自动结束小憩专注模式，顺便响起闹钟。

懒得看文章的可以快速自取 ：我要小睡一会儿

准备内容

快捷指令
一个女朋友及其手机号码和微信好友

配置过程
设置专注模式
所有 app 都不允许通知，所有设备之间共享，就是包括 Mac 电脑以及 Apple Watch 都同步状态。

选项配置，连三分钟内第二个来电都要禁止，因为前些年用手机号注册过法人，日均十个各类骚扰电话，打不通他们大概率还会再打一次，所以必须关闭。

快捷指令取变量做信息
整体逻辑就是，打开的时候选择想要小憩的时长，然后自动化其它操作。所以，第一部分就是选择时长的指令，这块也能自己改成一个手动输入项目，选择自己想睡的时长。

然后，需要两个在短信通知中发送给媳妇的重要变量——从 X 点睡到 Y 点，即通知超过这个时间之后电话才可以被打通。
通过「日期」脚本就能获取实时时间，通过「调整日期」就可以把时间修改为结束小憩的时间。通过一个「文本」脚本即可把两个关键变量和信息文案进行整理。

注意在时间变量可以按下图配置一下，这样就可以把冗余的日期信息去除了，短信内容结果呈现就是 xx:xx。

消息发送
第一个「信息发送」脚本就不多说，第二个「微信发送」在 Mac 端是不支持的，操作方法是在手机端先用 Siri 喊一句：

微信发送「要说的话」给「具体对象名字」。

Siri 这么操作成功一次之后，在快捷指令的脚本建议里面就自动出来了可选项，然后按「信息发送」脚本一样操作即可。

其它自动化
这部分就用默认的脚本选择专注模式结束时间，以及创建闹钟基础脚本即可。

心得体会及踩坑
Mac 端和 iOS 端的脚本还是存在一些割裂和 bug，例如我在 iOS 上设置了微信发送，在 Mac 端打开了一下工程文件，手机上再打开就会默认变成了企业微信发送消息，企业微信好友没有媳妇微信然后就报错了（那说明也可以用企业微信定时来给真领导发送汇报了）。

Mac 端无法直接使用闹钟脚本，搜半天发现压根就不在候选里面，微信和企业微信也是没法直接搜到的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3 年前，Apple 发布了 Apple Watch Series 4，升级了更大显示屏的同时，也带来了心电图功能。然而，国行版本的手表却与它无缘 —— 倒不是说硬件不支持，而是在软件上需要适配及审核。
直到今天，Apple 在最新的 iOS 15.2 和 watchOS 8.3 系统中，终于将过审已久的心电图功能带到国行 Apple Watch 上。除了心电图之外，iOS 15.2 其实还有不少值得关注的功能，一起来看看吧。
国行 Apple Watch 支持心电图
盼望着，盼望着，心电图终于来了。只要你的手表是 Apple Watch S4 及之后的款式，在升级了 watchOS 8.3 和 iOS 15.2 之后，就可以在 iOS 设备的「健康 > 浏览 > 心脏」中打开它。稍等一会，Apple Watch 上便会出现心电图 App。
如果你先前已经通过各种方式开通了心电图功能，更新后不会受到影响。

要使用心电图也很简单，只需佩戴好手表后打开心电图 App，将另一只手的食指放在数码表冠上，30 秒之后就能完成检测，同时检测结果也会即时同步到 iOS 设备的健康 App 中。你可以在健康 App 中将心电图导出为 PDF 文件提供给医生作为参考。
不过需要重点注意：Apple Watch 并非专业医疗设备，心电图检测的结果只能参考，不能用于诊断心脏病等疾病。如果对检测的结果有疑问或有身体不适，还是尽快咨询医生为好。

另外值得一提的是，此次国行 Apple Watch 的心电图功能，全称为「移动心电图房颤提示软件」，且软件版本为 V1，支持检测正常心率下的房颤。而目前最新的软件版本为 V2，除了支持 V1 版本的功能外，还能够检测高心率下的房颤。

App 隐私报告可视化
在以往的 iOS 15 系统中，App 隐私报告这一功能就已经存在了。只不过彼时我们只能选择导出…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一证虽小，意义非凡！！
自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。
因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。
退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： 
一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇
当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。
退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。

在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。
但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。

二、光荣的象征
 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。
 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。
对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。
三、身份的证明
 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。
 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。
 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。
四、全国通用
近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。
而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。
不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 
退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。

而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！

Apple 推送一系列正式版系统更新
12 月 14 日，Apple 开始向旗下产品推送新一轮正式版系统。
iOS/iPadOS 15.2 新增了 Apple Music 声控方案，还包括了「App 隐私报告」与 Apple ID「数字遗产」等功能。iPhone 13 Pro 与 iPhone 13 Pro Max 用户现在可以在设置中启用微距照片控制，用于切换到超广角镜头拍摄微距照片与视频。iPadOS 15.2 允许用户将快速备忘录的触发角改为左下角。此外还包括一系列功能与错误修复。
macOS Monterey 12.1 正式上线 SharePlay 功能，并修复了播放 HDR 视频可能导致崩溃、MagSafe 充电失灵等问题。值得一提的是「通用控制」再次延期，未能在该版本上线。此外，Apple 为老机型推送了 macOS Big Sur 11.6.2 以及 macOS Catalina 安全更新 2021-008，该补丁修复了一个可以绕过 macOS 安全机制的重大问题。
HomePod 15.2 软件更新增加了荷兰语及俄语 Siri，并支持新推出的 Apple Music 声控方案。
watchOS 8.3 除隐私报告与声控方案等更新外，还带来了此前获批的 ECG 功能。Apple Watch Series 4 及以后的机型（除 Apple Watch SE 外）现可使用移动心电图房颤提示软件，单通道心电图波形与相关分类及症状都会记录在「健康」App 中。来源

Data structures and algorithms are two terms that are often mentioned in the same sentence.

To answer these questions, this article will provide 8 types of data structures and algorithms that you might encounter in your everyday life. The article starts by giving the basics for each data structure or algorithm before explaining its function.

In order to use react-select in a french government project, we have to translate placeholders and other default options. As far as I know, there is no i18n extension for react-select; anyway, it may not have fit our need since there may be some domain-specific text. Here we go, let's use the component's props:
<Select
  loadingMessage={() => "Chargement…"}
  noOptionsMessage={() => "Aucun résultat"}
  placeholder="Choisissez une valeur"
  // …

It works.

React Hooks provide us with access to core React functionalities within the context of function components. Traditionally, to optimize React, developers have had to switch between function and class components, however, React Hooks allow us to use function components throughout projects to build both small and large applications.
If you’re a React developer who likes to write function components over class components, then this article is for you; we’ll look at three helpful yet somewhat underrated React Hooks that you might not be so familiar with, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, and useDebugValue. We’ll explore their use cases, syntax, and a few code examples. Let’s get started!

Although modern IDE and various tools provided by GitHub, Atlassian and other provide us an easy to use way to perform many git commands nothing compares to the power a terminal provides. Bellow you can find a list of my top git commands.

R, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.
Data science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code. These two languages are used by over half of all Fortune 500 companies so they're worth getting acquainted with!

Shortery：Mac 上的快捷指令自动化工具

平台：macOS
关键词：快捷指令、自动化

@huhuhang：快捷指令作为 iPhone 上出色的效率应用，终于在今年被 Apple 带到 Mac 平台。从长期来看，快捷指令也大有替代 Mac 原本的 Automator 的趋势。当然，由于 iOS 和 macOS 平台的属性不同，快捷指令在二者中的功能也不完全一致，并非简单的移植。例如你可以从菜单栏和访达中快速访问 Mac 版本的快捷指令，同时又缺失了 iOS 版本具有的自动化功能。

虽然官方尚未在 Mac 版的快捷指令中添加自动化触发选项，但第三方应用 Shortery 正好可以弥补这点不足。

Shortery 提供了七种不同的触发器来运行快捷指令：

应用程序启动和退出：当你启动或退出一个应用程序时运行快捷指令。
时间：设置快捷指令运行的时间，并定义它的重复频率。
唤醒和睡眠：在你的 Mac 进入睡眠或醒来后运行快捷指令。
登录：用户登录时触发，开始全新的一天。
键盘：定义一个全局热键并从任何应用程序中触发它。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「互联网正在着火」？
如果你多少关注信息安全资讯，或许在最近几天已经频繁听到 Log4Shell 这个漏洞的名字——或者一些更具传播性的说法，诸如「互联网正在着火」「过去十年最严重的漏洞」「现代计算机历史上最大漏洞」「难以想到哪家公司不受影响」之类（参见《洛杉矶时报》，12 月 10 日）。

这个被报道得神乎其神的 Log4Shell 漏洞（CVE-2021-44228）所针对的，是一个极为常用的 Java 库 Log4j（详见后文说明）。值得一提，这个漏洞最初是由一名中国工程师、阿里云安全团队的 Chen Zhaojun（微博）在 11 月下旬发现并提报的。
有记录的利用 Log4Shell 漏洞发起的攻击开始于 12 月 9 日，最初是针对微软的 Minecraft 游戏 Java 版。但人们很快发现 Log4Shell 的波及范围远不止于此。根据 GitHub 仓库 YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface 中的攻击案例截图，Apple iCloud、QQ 邮箱、Steam 商店、Twitter、百度搜索等一系列国内外主流服务或平台均存在该漏洞。

好在，Log4j 已经于 12 日发布 2.15.0 版本，修复了漏洞，并且对于暂不能升级的旧版提供了临时应对方案。
受影响的大型平台也作出快速响应。10 日，Minecraft 发布 1.18.1 版，说明已修复了漏洞；亚马逊发出安全警告称，「正积极监控该问题，并已在寻求解决方案」；IBM、Red Hat、甲骨文、VMware 等知名科技公司也宣称正在部署补丁；Apple 尽管没有官方回应，但根据 11 日的测试，原本受到影响的 iCloud 似乎也已经修复。此外，目前暂无因该漏洞导致重大安全事故的报道。
然而，由于该漏洞影响范围之广，受影响服务完成更新或修补仍需不少时间，因此近期内风险仍不可忽视。事…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不论是患者还是家属，对重症监护病房（ICU）那道厚厚的门档充满了恐惧，ICU 常被描述为「有去无回」的地方，现实中的「人间地狱」。在很多人的眼里，ICU 中各种生命支持设备维持下的患者是没有「灵魂」的，ICU 的医护人员是没有「人情」的，要问整个医院中最没有人文关怀的科室，ICU 必定站上榜首。
作为一名 ICU 医生，希望能通过这篇文章，带大家一起了解现代医疗下的 ICU 是怎样的一个地方。
重症监护病房的历史
ICU 在整个现代医学的发展中属于一股新生力量，在 1950 年左右，为了拯救脊髓灰质炎导致呼吸衰竭的患者，才出现第一批具有现代医学意义上的 ICU 雏形。随着医疗技术的逐步发展，才在之后的数十年中逐步创立了重症监护病房。而中国第一个 ICU 病房则是在 1982 年于北京协和医院设立的，创建之初是只有 1 张床位的外科ICU，之后的 2 年，才创立了拥有 7 张床的 ICU 中心，从此开启了中国重症监护医学的元年。
在创立之初，由于患者需要大量的麻醉治疗、呼吸机治疗等方面的支持，ICU 大部分医生是由麻醉医生构成的，此时的ICU更多扮演着麻醉科附属科室的角色。随着 2003 年严重呼吸系统综合征 SARS、2005 年禽流感、2008 年汶川地震等重大公共卫生安全事件的相继爆发，大量危重症患者需要 ICU 的支持治疗，使得重症医学迅速发展壮大，2009 年正式认定为临床医学的二级学科，成为中国现代医学重要的组成部分。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。
非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。
我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。
首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。



其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~

厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。

对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。
最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如此有价值的一个问题不光没几个人答，而且先前仅有的两个回答居然都在胡说八道……这不能忍，怒答一发。
羽毛球世界杯赛的“停办”在历史上一共有两次，一次是1997-2005的暂时停办，一次就是2006年后至今的无限期永久停办，而这两次停办背后的原因其实是完全不同的。
这项赛事最初的举办是在1981年——那一年的另外一个重大历史事件就是原国际羽联IBF和原世界羽联WBF正式合并成新的国际羽联IBF（也就是现在我们熟悉的新世界羽联BWF的前身），而它的首次停办是在1997年，这期间一共举办了17次比赛，但可能出乎很多人常识认知范畴之外的是，这17次比赛的主办方其实并不是世界羽联IBF，而是总部位于美国纽约的国际管理集团IMG。

由此我们也可以得知，1997年的羽毛球世界杯赛停办，其背后的根本原因应当是由于作为主办方的IMG集团内部的业务变更与项目调整，尽管具体的情况目前已不得而知，但可以想见国际羽联对于这次停办的话语权应当不是很大的。
然而新世纪以来在湖南益阳分别于2005年和2006年举办的第18和第19届世界杯赛的情况以及世界杯赛在那之后的第二次停办，其背后的原因则与前文所述大相径庭。

首先不同于以往的是，这两届世界杯赛事的重启已经不再经过原本作为赛事主办方的IMG集团的点头，而是在当时由国际羽联IBF方面自行牵头、并同时联合我国的一些大型国有企业与地方私营企业（譬如中国移动和赛琪体育等）进行合作规划从而最终得以实现的，同时在性质上也被重新认定是不计世界排名积分的“邀请赛”——尽管从届数上这两次比赛仍按第18、19届世界杯进行顺延，也就是名义上仍继承了此前于1997年停办的老世界杯赛的衣钵，但由于整个比赛重启之后一直带着一股抹不去的“非正式赛事”的味道，因此在公众看来其在此后进行常态化办赛的前景始终是不明朗的。
其次也是最主要的一点就是这两届“新世界杯”的赛制与赛事性质的定…]]></summary>

经过接近一个月的开发工作，Switshot 2.0 版本终于正式地与大家见面。
相较于「简陋」的 Switshot 1.x 版本，Switshot 2.0 可以说是完全重构的版本。不仅在 1.x 版本中出现的诸多问题被统一修复，新版本还新增快捷指令功能，并为之后的媒体管理增强功能打下基础。
首先，介绍一下 Switshot
Nintendo Switch 11.0.0 固件更新为 Nintendo Switch 带来「发送至智能手机」功能。这个功能本质上是在 Switch 上启动一个 WLAN 热点和一个 Web 服务器，让手机连接到热点并访问服务器的资源（截屏和录制）。但是这个功能并没有想象中那么好用：除了需要扫描两次 QR 码之外，它将截屏和录制保存到手机上的方式也很原始：给你一个网页，让你长按保存……
老任啊，你这个发送功能，是来搞笑的吗？
后来，有人做了一款 Android app，可以直接读取 Switch 发送过来的媒体列表然后直接保存。对老任这个传输网页进行一点点 inspect 工作，发现 Switch 实际上会提供一个 JSON 列表，列表中包括在 Switch 中传过来的文件地址。
那么，下面就是「我上我也行」时间。我当即做了一个 快捷指令，自动读取 JSON 列表然后保存到图库。
最开始做 Switshot 非常机缘巧合：它是我做另外一款 app、等待 App Store 审核期间花半天时间摸出来的玩意，目的和上面提到的 app 和快捷指令一样：只需要扫一次码，就能一次性地把媒体保存起来。之后，我收到身边朋友…]]></summary>

严重远程代码执行漏洞影响国内外大型公司服务
12 月 10 日，一个旧版 Apache Log4j 2 远程代码执行漏洞细节被公开。Log4j 是一个用来记录日志信息的 Java 框架，被大量项目用于业务系统开发。该漏洞利用了 Log4j 对日志内容的递归解析功能，使得攻击者无需特殊配置即可直接构造恶意请求，触发远程代码执行漏洞，漏洞利用。受到影响的服务包括微软的 Minecraft 游戏、亚马逊的 AWS 云服务多项功能，Apple iCloud 以及国内的百度搜索、QQ 邮箱等服务经测试亦受影响。

目前 Apache Log4j 官方已发布安全通告（CVE-2021-44228），并发布 Log4j 2.15.0 版本，对主要引发漏洞的 JNDI 功能强化默认安全设置，从而修复了漏洞，并针对旧版提出了补救建议，但受影响厂商完成更新或修补预计仍需时间。来源

Usually people search for patterns to follow but some of them are searching for the anti-patterns to avoid, In my opinion both are equally important, as by knowing them you are leveling up your skills in programming using a specific tool.
To understand what are the anti-patterns we need first to define what is a pattern. a pattern is usually a well known solution for a recurring problem, or we can first talk about the concept through a food metaphor.
This plate (for people who don't know) is a street Egyptian food called "Koshary", I picked it because it has quite a lot of ingredients including rice, pasta, hummus, lentil, tomato sauce, and more.

A Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger network that is cryptographically secured.
Think of it as a database where different features can be built on such as coins, apps etc and no single entity has control over it. This allows for transparency, security and gives everyone full control of their assets.
We have 3 major types of networks in computing, they are:

In a centralized network, all the data and information is regulated by a single entity. Example Facebook, WhatsApp etc they are all centralized.
In a decentralized network, different nodes on the network have equally control and the source of Truth is checked on the network to ensure that everyone …]]></summary>

Para validar o formato de um CPF, por exemplo, é necessário que esteja no seguinte padrão:

Então através de uma RegEx conseguimos identificar se esse padrão foi seguido ou não.
Usando a linguagem de programação Python, importa-se o módulo re que fornece operações de expressões regulares.

About the same time we worked on integrating GitHub Continuous Integration into our SSG project, GitHub announced they are holding 2021 GitHub Action hackathon in collaboration with Dev. This year, we’re encouraged to utilize existing GitHub Actions to create workflows solutions other developers can utilize to solve problems with open source. My submission was a workflow to run code linter and formatter on only changed files and run test on only changed workspaces of a monorepo. I used what learned from building an SSG in OSD600 to build this project. After all, I walked away having a deeper understanding of GitHub actions, from exploring many existing actions, to building a useful one and publishing it to GitHub marketplace.
The other contributions were for improving website accessibility and responsiveness in Telescope. These fixed some of the minor issues I encountered while using Telescope myself.

So why is documentation so important ?

Since Python is a dynamically typed language, coding modules for example a piece of code for a function can take any parameter values without any validations or checks. In some cases, the function name and parameters may be self-explanatory but how the parameters and function work may be unknown unless the code is read which can contain large number of complexities.Therefore having documentation on inputs and outputs of a fu…]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-12-12T13:31:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。
当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。
总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……

作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。
从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。

大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。
锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。

然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。
早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？
据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。

其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。
以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。

在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows 沙盒是内置于 Windows 部分版本中的一次性 Windows 虚拟机，它简单免费，启动速度快，并且用完即删。在需要使用不适合安装在实体机器上的应用、亦或者测试安全性未知的文件时，Windows 沙盒都是非常实用的工具。
然而，和真正的虚拟机相比，它的自定义空间「似乎」很小：沙盒默认屏蔽了摄像头和打印机，如此一来部分应用就无法运行；想要在沙盒中安装软件要么从主机复制安装包，要么再次下载；由于沙盒是一次性的，有用的文件还要在销毁沙盒前手动复制进主机……
幸运的是，以上问题都能通过专属于 Windows 沙盒的配置文件解决。Windows 沙盒配置文件为纯文本，后缀名 .wsb，可以用于定义沙盒的 vGPU 状态、网络信号、文件夹映射等属性。下文将通过三个具体实例演示配置文件的使用方法。最后一节会列出所有可用配置项供大家参考。
Windows 沙盒的开启方法请参考此文：

Windows 10 五月更新即将推送，浅色模式、沙盒和新的搜索功能都要来了

用例一：允许沙盒应用使用摄像头，临时运行视频会议应用
让我们从最简单的例子开始讲起，介绍配置文件的新建和使用流程。
假设我们需要在沙盒中运行一个视频会议软件，默认情况下，鉴于一些安全问题，沙盒屏蔽了应用对摄像头的访问。因而下面我们需要配置沙盒允许视频输入。

在桌面通过右键新建一个文本文件。确保你能看到该文件的后缀名 .txt。如果看不到，需要勾选 文件资源管理器 > 查看（顶部） > 显示 > 文件扩展名。

双击此文件进入编辑界面。输入：
<Configuration>
 <VideoInput>Enable</VideoInput>
</Configuration>

沙盒的配置文件非常好理解，字母大小写任意，结构类似俄罗斯套娃：最外面一层 <Configuration> </Configuration> …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://dev.to/harshhhdev/custom-cursors-in-react-2c8"/>
        <updated>2021-12-11T23:37:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I've seen across many designer/design studio websites are a cool custom cursor in place of your default computer one. Recently, I added one to my website aswell.
I had to write one from scratch (using some internet resources of course!), since all the NPM libraries I found were either outdated, or didn't support SSR.
After adding the cursor to my own website, I had an idea to create an NPM package for it for a while. This weekend, I had some freetime from school & got to work!
This library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js & Remix)
Want a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak & experiment around with values!
To download the library, head over to your terminal:
yarn add custom-pointer-react

Next, import the cursor component into your file & customise it! Don't forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.
import { Cursor } from 'custom-pointer-react'
...
const Cursor = () => {
  return (
    ...
    <Cursor {...passParametersToCustomise} />
    ...
  )
}
...
export default App

All parameters are optional, & here's a list of the different parameters which you can customise: 



Parameter
Description
Default




color
The background colour of the cursor
#000000


showRing
Controls whether to show the ring around the cursor
true


ringSize
Controls the size of the ring around the cursor
50px


cursorSize
Controls the size of the cursor
10px


ringBorder
Controls the width of the ring's border
2px



Need help finding the right parameters? Check out the demo website!
Now, go into your app & import the MouseContext provider.
import { MouseContextProvider } from 'custom-pointer-react'
...
ReactDOM.render(
  <MouseContextProvider>
    <App />
  </MouseContextProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
...

Your custom cursor should be good to go!]]></summary>

As someone who is definitely not an Angular expert I was looking for a clean solution on how to listen for element events that are part of a child component's template.
This is of course quite a trivial thing but it might be of value to people who are starting with Angular and are facing the same problem.
Let's start.
Situation:
We want to listen to child component input element's events inside of the parent component. (do something with it in the parent)
Parent template code: (parent.component.html)
<div>
  <h1>Parent component</h1>
  <angular-child></angular-child>

Child template code: (child.component.html)

This is sort of new for me. I've never really been a business guy - more the kind of dude that just codes away behind the scenes - but I've been working on a really cool project and thought it fit to show the community. We also hit #1 on Hacker News, so I figured there was a fair bit of crossover :-)
Short description
1SecondPainting is an artificial intelligence art generator that lets people create their own, stunning quality paintings in seconds.  You can then purchase canvas prints, framed posters, or digital downloads (for NFTs). Every painting sold is 100% unique - you're in full control of your art.
I combined some pretty cutting edge ML with a proprietary post-processing pipeline to deliver probably the highest quality art of this kind (in my opinion, though of course I'm biased).
A lot of people have called it unsettling & kind of scary, which I agree with! If you're interested, you can try it for yourself here. Let me know what you think :)
Thanks,
Nick]]></summary>

Create copies of websites for accessing them offline
It also allows you to change the URL of the downloaded website, which can be very helpful when moving an existing static website from a domain to another.

Then I built a Docker image that is a perfect fit for our needs: there everything is in it to build our project.
But, I almost went on panic when I realized that, since a key component is an operator, and a cli that interacts with Kubernetes, we need to be able to access a Kubernetes cluster for development FROM a container.
In my initial plans, I would have setup a cluster Kubernetes in the virtual machine itself. But now, that everything is in a container? I actually felt initially very smart having the idea of setting up a Kubernetes cluster using kind. It is a tool that can build a Kubernetes cluster just using d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[故事要從 Python 的語言特性說起，因為 Python 是動態型別的，所以一個在同一個區塊（命名空間）內的變數 x，可以一下是字串，一下是整數：
x = 4
print(type(4)) # at this moment, x points to an integer

x = "Hello, world"
print(type(x)) # and at this moment, x points to a string

這樣的特性降低了 Python 的學習曲線，但在程式專案變複雜後，對於「值」與「型態」的掌握會越來越難以駕馭。
大約在 Python 3.5 起引入了 type hints，華文叫類型提示或型態提示，它讓我們得以聲明變數的型態，也可以聲明函式回傳值的型態。
有了 type hints，IDE 或是靜態分析工具就可以幫助我們偵測型態上的錯誤，也因為它只是 hints，所以它終究無法讓 Python 變成靜態型別語言，只是一種輔助而已。
下面是最基本的 type hints 範例：
name: str = "world"

def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello " + name

greeting(name)

上面我們用 : str 聲明 name 為字串，以及在函式我們用 -> str 聲明 greeting() 回傳的也是字串，當然還有更複雜的用法，可以參見〈Python Type Hints 從入門到實踐〉。
以上為前情提要，下面開始談本文的主角 Pydantic 。
Pydantic 是以 type hints 為基礎，幫我們做資料型態驗證的套件，我們可以用它定義「Model」：
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EmployeeModel(…]]></summary>

年末囤货是广大人民群众喜闻乐见的一种娱乐形式，「双十一」的网购热潮还没完全消退，各大电商平台就已经纷纷开始为即将到来的「双十二」开启预热了。谈及两大购物节优惠力度最大的商品品类，笔记本电脑绝对是绕不过的话题。近年来，主流品牌的「静坐战争」、供应链的极尽成熟和 AMD Ryzen 处理器的强势崛起为众多非传统笔电厂商的入局创造了条件，因 COVID-19 新冠疫情防治工作而催生的居家办公和网课教育等专业需求则有力的推动了笔记本电脑的技术进步和市场细分，日薄西山的笔电行业竟在一夜之间「垂死病中惊坐起」，然而「铁马冰河入梦来」的滚滚矿潮很快将显卡乃至固态硬盘等核心硬件的缺货荒蔓延到了笔电市场，在市场价格与用户需求持续走高的大环境下，电商平台的年末大促俨然成了各大厂商的主战场，至于如何在这片战场上长驱直入和全身而退就成了用户需要考虑的问题。
想要购买到一台让自己心仪的笔记本电脑，在按下「立刻购买」前需要做的准备工作无外乎理清需求、估计预算、比较规格和确认细节，而在实际选购的过程中，以上四点中的前两者为必要条件，后两者则为充分条件。考虑到现在的笔电产品在目标价位和硬件规格上的表现相对直观，所以本文将从容易受到忽视的产品定位和设计细节进行筛选，本着宁缺毋滥的原则，为少数派们推荐一些称心好用的笔电产品。
本文内容具有时效性，硬件配置参数和测试数据来自互联网，仅供参考。

Learning how to use cloud servers and utilizing cloud computing is one of the must-have skills in current-day software development. There are plenty of options when it comes to cloud service providers, for example, Heroku, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services etc. Today, I am going to show how to spin up a cloud server on AWS, one of the most popular options and is used by many software companies.
First of all, AWS is very complicated and it has many tools that you will never need to use. For the purpose of just hosting a cloud server, we are going to focus on the tool AWS EC2.
Prerequisite: Make sure you already have an AWS account (duh)
Step1: Login to AWS and search EC2 and create an instance

Federated learning is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.
Horizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples. For example, two regional banks may have very different user groups from their respective regions, a…]]></summary>

GitHub Copilot is one of the most discussed matters in programming universe nowadays and I've finally got my hands on it.
During the time I've spent testing this awesome miracle I've thought about many things simultaneously and once I was thinking straight again I got frightened. It is a strange feeling how much programming has evolved since the days I've begun to program, how much the tools advanced, how much the frameworks and libraries became more efficient and made programming more enjoyable and easier. But then comes this revolutionary revolution! I know there were other AI code assistants before GitHub's Copilot but this one is really something else.

### Getting CSS Into Your HTML
To connect your CSS sheet to your HTML page, use the link tag like so.
Many developers use External pre-written CSS stylesheets for consistent design.
You can connect multiple stylesheets.
CSS Selector : Applies styles to a specific DOM element(s), there are various types:
Type Selectors : Matches by node name.
-   Class Selectors : Matches by class name.
-   ID Selectors : Matches by ID name.
-   Universal Selectors : Selects all HTML elements on a page.
-   Attribute Selectors : Matches elements based on the prescence or value of a given attribute. (i.e. a[title] will match all a elements with a title attribute)

SaaS, or Software as a service, alongside IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service), maybe a way of cloud-computing service delivery, where clients buy software, hosted on a foreign server, per each use or subscribers on a monthly or a yearly basis. There are three storage modes: public-cloud — when infrastructure is hosted by third-party data centers, private-cloud — within the companies network, and hybrid — a mixed approach.
The popularity of SaaS has been growing for thirty years. It appeared within the 70-is because computers were huge and very expensive, and many companies couldn't afford to possess one.

You hold the gun I take the wheel

And though this love has its flaw

Why do they still want me to hate ya
Cause if im choosing to forget it
Why cant they just mind they business
Cause I’m stuck, stuck like glue

stroke-dasharray implementation


Salomone Baquis talks about this in this post. This method uses the stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties to draw a slice of border around SVG circles. Read the post to see how he do it.
The problem is that we can't interact we the slices. For example, we can't change the color of the slice on hover or do something when the slice is clicked. 
z-index hides all the other elements below it. Have a look at the illustration below, and pay attention to the ID of the circle that is highlighted (42).

What we want is something like this:

After settling in Green Hills, Sonic is eager to prove he has what it takes to be a true hero. His test comes when Dr. Robotnik returns, this time with a new partner, Knuckles, in search for an emerald that has the power to destroy civilizations. Sonic teams up with his own sidekick, Tails, and together they embark on a globe-trotting journey to find the emerald before it falls into the wrong hands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[简单谈一谈个人的看法。
电影里的励志、鸡汤，其本身都不是原罪。重要的是，作品的励志与鸡汤是否真正地站在真实性的基础之上。只有客观而忠实地反映了真实，作品才有了励志与鸡汤的基本说服力。
《雄狮少年》，不是完全彻底的励志向作品，而它给出的真实反映水平，也是“不完全”的：拥有了对真实表象的呈现，却未能走到表象之下。理想与现实，传统文化与当代社会，精神信仰与物质压力，一系列的冲突，也就此停留在了“足够客观的表象展现”程度上。表象客观全面，已经在同类、国产作品里颇为少有，可称“不错”；而缺乏深度细化，则阻碍了它向更优秀之处的攀登脚步，必须报以一声“遗憾”。

这部作品的第一组镜头，便强化了自身的现实属性。在旁白的介绍里，舞狮是中国传统文化的象征存在，代表着曾经时代的光辉。然而，随着一句“主角却不是他”，就将现实的时代做了切换——一个长镜头跟随着骑车的男主角，扫过了破落的农村街景，以及衣衫褴褛的民众，让当代社会的时态呈现出来。曾经以舞狮为骄傲的传统时光已经不复存在，取而代之的，是在物质压力下被迫的生存之道，经济落后地区的家庭为了赚钱，家长只能背井离乡，去大城市打工，而诞生无数的留守家庭。
包括此时出现的主角形象，都在强调着现实的因素。他不是动漫主角常有的大眼美男，而是生活里比较普遍的单眼皮少年，其后，这种形象也延伸到了女主角扁塌的鼻梁上。这样的形象，让人物彻底回归了现实感最强的“普通”之中——他没有任何突出的地方，外形都如此平庸，也就不具备所谓的“被选中之子”之类的潜藏天赋。
而主角随后的遭遇，更是让这个信息有了更明确的落地。心怀舞狮憧憬的他，被称为病猫。而抢走他红包的舞狮队成员，一方面体现着舞狮这样的传统文化于物质化当代的变质，同时也反过来说明了舞狮衰落的原因——忙于赚钱的人们，不再对舞狮这样的东西抱有兴趣，这便让历史悠久的陈家村舞狮队，也丧失了自己本应具有的骄傲，物质功利了起来，以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[再平凡的菜
都值得被“包”起来
东北贼顶饿的大包子，老~老~老~香了。
在江浙沪，包子似点心，生煎、小笼、灌汤包，脸上写着小巧、精致和娇滴滴；





在东北，包子继承了东北菜量大、实惠的特色，变得狂放不羁，不仅大大大，馅料的花样更是多了去了：从普普通通的白菜猪肉、韭菜鸡蛋，到稍稍奇特的酸菜油滋、红烧排骨，再到奢华的虾仁海肠、龙虾帝王蟹，仿佛啥都能往包子里包。
流淌着东北基因的大包子，以无所不“包”的姿态，承包下了东北人的胃。



每一个东北包子里
都包得下一盘菜
但凡能上桌的，一多半的菜都能被东北人包进包子里。



无论是绿油油的韭菜鸡蛋，还是油汪汪的酸菜白肉，哪怕是红烧排骨、大龙虾这种硬货，都是东北包子馅料的选项。


大菜包能有多少花样？
东北人对蔬菜有着非常庞大的定义，不是肉肉的，都算蔬菜家族。
但对于菜包子的定义来说，就没那么精准了。馅料全是蔬菜的，是菜包子；但以蔬菜为主，肉来增香的，也可以算进菜包子。





韭菜包、白菜包、酸菜包、大头菜包、茴香包和萝卜包、豆腐包等等，都是东北很常见的菜包子，根据个人喜好，还可以搭配上粉丝、鸡蛋或者猪肉碎。
尤其是酸菜，不仅能和白肉组成酸菜猪肉包，还能和白肉的二代产物——“油滋啦”组成油滋酸菜包。





冬季杀年猪后，东北人家会用猪肥肉来炼猪油，炸后的“油滋啦”不仅没有白肉那么油腻，还增添了一份脆爽的口感，和酸菜做包子馅，更是喷香十足。
再者，豆角猪肉包也是东北包子的一大特色。此豆角可非彼豆角：在南方，豆角多指豇豆；在东北，豆角多是那种短粗的扁豆、豆王或者叫芸豆，不同地方名字略有不同。



东北的豆角猪肉包，做起来有个关键要素，豆角要用热水焯成半熟，能很好的祛除豆腥味，也更容易蒸熟。豆角包在面皮里，不仅有一股豆香气，也让包子的口感更加丰富。
在东北大包中，玉米面菜包也很有特色。



东北是中国玉米的重要产区，在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[柯娜是一款小品级游戏，也是一款美丽的游戏，但游戏毕竟不是画，不能光好看。作为一款ARPG，它在游戏性的表现上，距离它的美术水平就差得太远了。
先附上大师难度的几个BOSS战，很可能你看着都很无聊。

目录

战斗深度不足

战斗变化不够
弱点位置很微妙
镜头与目标

剧情的薄弱
迷题，缺少巧妙感
无用的收集
不会再出现的怪物
结论

战斗深度不足
作为一款动作游戏，战斗自然是重点，关于此，柯娜可以说是 不及格 。随着时间的推移，战斗体验没有一点可以刺激玩家的因素增加。前期的战斗非常匮乏，而后期同样匮乏。
战斗缺少变化
柯娜虽然有技能树，但能够带来战斗变化的技能几乎没有，除了拉弓的子弹时间。几乎所有解锁的技能，要么是可用性低，要么是伤害不够。
大多数的精英怪或BOSS战都有弱点，攻击弱点后，它会硬直一长段时间，这时候肯定是输出打伤害的最佳时机，像任天堂的大多数游戏都遵循这个套路，甚至有些还只能靠这个时候才能制造伤害，但是柯娜在这个时候，两手空空，不管你用重攻击还是腐灵锤，伤害区别都不太大，很憋屈。
疾跑重攻击，完美蓄力攻击
其实，技能的伤害变化不大没有关系，既然被攻击到弱点硬直了，好歹增加点弱点伤害，也是可以接受的。有时候多死几次后，我就想寻找一下有没有什么技能可以提升这种情况下的伤害，但并没有。
很直白，从游戏开始到结束，全程基本上都是在刮沙。
弱点位置很微妙
首先需要区分一下“不容易”和“无法”这两个概念。不容易是说机会出现了，但不容易好抓住，而无法是出现的机会都极少或是没有。柯娜就是后者，很多的精英怪弱点在背上，但它会永远面对着你，不管你跑得多快，甚至开启子弹时间，都很难攻击到。设计上，要有，就得给我明确的机会，要么就不要给。我有时候为了打弱点，把自己人头送了，都没有打到，很有摔手柄的冲动。还有就是，这个弱点带来的收益很小，除了能够阻止一次敌人的行动，外加一点点额外的伤害，真的是一点点，没看出来有多大的区别。
镜头与目标
镜头的问题其实是可以通过设置关闭的，但这个默认开启的选项，就是一个错误。前面的最多是让你不够爽快，那这个问题，就是在让你抓狂，虽然出现在的情况不多，但出现的时候很可能就是很重要的时刻。
表现为：镜头有一个弱机制，就是会帮助朝向目标，但当需要转向寻找补血的花时，有时候镜头会自动的拉回目标，这很可能会让你失去补血的时间。同理，在多个目标存在的情况下，这问题也同样存在。
我一向对于逆反馈的设计很反感，不太明白这个设计的用意。
剧情的薄弱
要说战斗设计不太行，那好好的讲讲故事也可以，但并没有。一共3段，每段取得3个信物，然后就可以和被腐化的灵魂战斗，目的就是解放他们。听上去是不是很像任天堂的游戏，但是这三段并没有啥联系，讲道理，直接去杀最终BOSS也没什么必要前提条件。那这些都是在告诉我们什么呢？什么都没有，就连主角的情况也基本上没有说明，最后就是玩了个寂寞，啥也没明白。
迷题
说它有，它确实有，但也可以说没有，因为不够巧妙的迷题的意义与作用并不大，而且类型太过相同。给你制造了一些关卡，但却不需要你思考，甚至可以说连想都不会让你想一下，靠感觉就可以了。比如说按顺序点灯，提示都在很明显的位置，而且只是提示，没有任何逻辑。

无用的收集
可收集一共有3个：腐灵，冒子和那个什么（太不重要，名字都记不得）。除了腐灵可以增加使用次数，冒子和那个什么的目的是同一个，那就是给地上的腐灵戴冒子，光找到冒子还不行，还得用那个什么去买。到最后，我都没有把那个什么用出去。
这明显有充数的嫌疑。
不会再出现的怪物
场景里清掉的怪，就不会再出现，不管是否再次进入该区域，只能重新游戏。之所以我把它拧出来说，是因为有奖杯要求，如：“物归原主”。

如果你在路上错过了，那你只能开新周目再来了。
我当时还是为了做这个奖杯，在农田那边找到了目标怪物，但因为一个不小心，把它打死了，然后，本周目就无法完成了。
难道是为了帖合主题，腐化净化了，怪物消灭后就不再出现了？不可思议。这是游戏啊，同志们。
结论
本文的战斗部分，我是在普通通关，大师难度未开始这段时间写的。现在是我大师难度通关后，因此，我可能需要对战斗部分做一些补充，虽然它无法影响我对于战斗设计问题的大方向，但我仍然看到了另一个点，那就是它的战斗核心： 反应挑战 。 没有宏大的场景、炫酷的招式、华丽的必杀，有的只是见招拆招的反应。它并不一定好，但却是一个很重要的战斗本质 。
实话实说，BOSS战我打得很尽兴，那种必须要面对的招式，就得全神贯注，大师难度通关后，成就感满满。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[德章泰-莫里在12月10日对阵掘金的比赛里拿到20分8篮板9助攻，从而成为马刺队史最快完成3000分+1500篮板+1000助攻的球员。
这条纪录里的“最快”对于如今重建的马刺来说似乎隐含了特殊意义，一名职业运动员的生涯长度总是有限的，而“最快”意味“用时最短”，那么一名运动员能用更短的时间比其他人完成更多的工作，按照这个趋势那不就意味着他的整个职业生涯能比其他人创造更多的价值？也就说明他是更好的球员？
已经迈入重建期的马刺，需要未来的想象空间，但同时也需要在当下看到其中的确定性，前者固然重要，但后者是让人相信前者能实现的基础。
而25岁已经达到3000+1500+1000的莫里无疑是二者兼备的存在，莫里正在用赛场上的进化说服球迷们相信他是值得下注的那个人。



许多球评都把莫里列入了新晋全明星的选择，甚至最佳进步球员也应该有他的一席之地，在这份热烈的舆论氛围里，我们不妨来探讨莫里这赛季在哪些方面的实质性进化给他带来了好评？
我认为，针对这个问题一言以蔽之就是：莫里变成了更好的组织后卫。
如果展开来谈莫里做了什么让自己变成了“更好的组织后卫”，可以用北京时间12月7日马刺惜败太阳的比赛来作为观察的样本。
这场比赛马刺的3连胜被终结，而作为马刺战术核心的莫里则随着比赛进程经历了“从打击防守到被防守限制“的起伏，既能看到莫里进化后的姿态，也能看到莫里尚待打磨的不足。



本赛季，莫里完全接过了进攻组织的主动权，他过去三年场均触球数从56.4到69再到现在的88，展示了他从德罗赞小弟成长为马刺大哥的过程。
人称杨队的塞德斯-杨这样评价莫里：”他每个夜晚都在很好地运营球队”，这里的运营包括场外也包括场内，场外的事情我们局外人不便多说，场内的事情作为观众我们可以略窥一二。
面对总决赛球队的防线，莫里送出了赛季次高的14次助攻，这14次助攻则是他运营比赛的具体展现。而莫里本赛季助攻…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[昨晚，我窝在沙发，看乒乓球世界杯男单决赛，樊振东对阵张本智和，看着看着，我的注意力忽然被张本智和的名字吸引：TOMOKAZU HARIMOTO

唾沫……卡组，哈里……摩托？我照着念了出来，与此同时，电视里的解说员仍在说：“张本智和这一板抢攻很果断，但是……”
我：？？？不是TOMOKAZU HARIMOTO吗？张本在哪？智和又在哪？


之前在别的比赛里也看过类似的情况，评论员说的名字，跟画面显示出来的英文名读音完全不一样。


这也太奇怪了吧？英文名字Micheal翻译成迈克或者迈克尔，好歹读音差不多啊。

而且很久以前，我就注意到，像“波多野结衣”，明明念作“哈他挪雨衣（Hatano yui）”，根本就没有“波多”，也没有“结衣”，那为啥大家叫她“波多老师”呢？波多在哪儿呢？为什么不叫哈老师呢？


带着这个疑问，我看完比赛就立刻去查了一下资料，发现背后的缘由还蛮有意思。


通俗解释一下：张本智和为什么是"哈里摩托"

很久很久以前，日本只有语言，没有文字，大家就是愣说，不写。
但有时候没有文字确实不太方便，于是人们开始试着造文字，但是实在太特么难了。

后来他们发现：这个世界上已经有了一种叫“汉字”的东西，用它的人都非常厉害，个个都是人才。日本的官修史书《日本书纪》记载着：公元258年，一个叫王仁的博士（真的是个博士），把汉籍传入日本（其中据说有《论语》）。
诶，既然汉字这么博大精深，那就直接拿汉字来用吧！
但是他们很快发现，汉字太坑了——同一个字，居然有好多种读音！
因为不同朝代的发音有区别，以及传过去的人是不同地方的，说话可能有地方口音，同一篇文章，让一个广东羊，和让一个胡建棱或者北京人儿来念，那肯定不一样的，所以日文里的汉字就出现很多种读法，汉音、吴音、唐音、古训、俗训等等。
但是大体上分成两派：
“音读”一派主张按照传入时的汉语发音，或者模仿相…]]></summary>

这样的细节绝不是临时起意的花架子，4年前，杜指导执教中国男篮蓝队，在金砖运动会上不敌俄罗斯屈居亚军，赛后他就在更衣室与每一位球员击掌鼓励。可紧接着的亚洲杯，蓝队面对澳大利亚下半场崩盘，杜指导的赛后仪式便也在舆论中石沉大海，葬身批评指责之中了。
2018年男篮对抗赛对伊朗
从2012年退役开始做国家队助教，2013年成为广东主帅，杜指导的教练生涯比之球员时代坎坷复杂得多，即便是2017年他将广东重新带回了总决赛，但遭遇新疆横扫，加上国家队的失利，他的眼前都是一片黯淡。
彼时的他，彼时的大家都猜不到短短4年后，风评逆转。对一名教练来说，口碑逆转可能只需要他获得荣誉赢得胜利的那一个夜晚便足够，可那一场胜利的背后，需要的往往是教练、球员、球队持续多年的试炼和等待。
你们还记得，那些年“任性”的杜指导和广东的后卫荒吗？

我们选取的是2015年12月27日对阵青岛的比赛，为什么是这一场？15-16赛季，正好是京粤争霸结束，广东连续输给北京，杜指导声望最低之时。对青岛这一场，广东先赢后输被逆转，遭遇极为罕见的3连败，自从广东崛起以来这近20年，常规赛3连败似乎仅此一回，那时几乎是全网热议广东是否会换帅。
回到那场比赛，让我们来看看不被理解的杜指导的篮球哲学，和他所遭遇的理想与现实的极度反差。
广东的首发阵容：周湛东、周鹏、朱芳雨、埃克-迪奥古、易建联，由于威尔-拜纳姆带伤，杜指导决定打1小4大。
在成为主帅后，杜指导不止一次表达过自己提速的理念，“我希望加快球队进攻的速率，打灵活式的篮球，而不是摆桩子。勇士就是这种风格，这也是国际篮球的一个发展趋势。”

提速通常需要一些必备要素，比如经验丰富的后卫，攻击力出众的锋线，或者移动能力强…]]></summary>

笔者对本作的体验覆盖了游戏首发至今的各版本，本文对游戏内容的描述基于最新的 1.31 版本；
本文包含情节、机制上的完全剧透，不建议未通关的玩家直接阅读；另外本文还包含了对剧集《真探 第一季》、小说集《猎魔人 - 命运之剑》中短篇小说《别的东西》的部分剧透，请酌情阅读相关文段；
本文的探讨仅围绕游戏内容，其产品宣传、不同平台质量差异等游戏外因素，均不属于本文涉及的范围；
由于笔者判断本作的中文翻译存在一些精准性问题，部分情况下可能遗漏、曲解英文表意，故下文涉及任务名称等处将优先使用英文。

相信对不少和笔者一样玩家来说，作为《巫师（The Witcher）》游戏系列的爱好者，在开启《赛博朋克 2077（Cyberpunk 2077）》（以下简称《2077》）的体验前，可能多多少少都抱着与对前者类似的预期。
关联阅读：风口浪尖上的 CDPR 和《赛博朋克 2077》，到底怎么了？
然而与期待大相径庭是，《2077》展现给玩家的将是比《巫师》更加直白、更加复合、更加深刻，甚至是更加苦涩的情绪体验。
断断续续差不多一年的游玩之后，在《2077》满周岁的这个档口，笔者终于完成了此文，试图从游戏的机制、流程、情绪传达等方面入手，探讨《2077》如何带给玩家一段美丽而永不消逝、令人难以忘怀的体验。
♫ I'll be your mirror

如同游戏标题所昭示的，本作的故事主要发生在近未来的公元 2077 年，核心舞台是公司资本浇筑而成的超级都会「夜之城（Night City）」，在这个时代缩影般的一方天地里，玩家将扮演野心勃勃的佣兵 V，尝试扎根夜之城，最终，在自我价值实现、牵扯进公司阴谋、生命进入倒计时、与强尼·银手（Johnny Silverhand）建立起微妙关系等经历交织的漩涡中，踩出一条属于自己的出路。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国人懂吃，举世闻名，外国人不服不行。
具体有多出名呢？联合国教科文组织曾在全球范围内，认证了一批“世界美食之都”。截至2021年11月，全球共有19个闪闪发亮的美食之都，中国就占了其中5个：成都、顺德、澳门、扬州，以及前不久刚刚“进群”的淮安。



淮安，位于江苏省北部，古称“山阳”或“淮阴”，地处淮河与京杭大运河的交汇点，自古以来便是水运枢纽、南北要冲，素有“运河之都、九省通衢”之称。





这里，也正好位于中国南北地理分界线上。从古至今，这里车水马龙，天南地北的人与食材，在此交流碰撞，最终孕育出了这座美食之城，以及声名远扬的八大菜系之一——淮扬菜。





这座“不南不北”的城市，人文荟萃，名家辈出。西汉大将韩信，在此受漂母舍饭，终成汉初三杰；晚明奇才吴承恩，在此闭关求索，终成旷世奇书《西游记》；开国总理周恩来，以此为生命起点，终成新中国奠基人之一，更秉持着对家乡滋味的念怀，促成“开国第一宴”。
淮安，究竟有什么魔力，能以厚重历史和精妙美味征服世界，连联合国都流了口水？


淮扬菜，南北吃货大战的终结者
也许你对淮安不熟，但你一定吃过淮扬菜。



在中国八大菜系之中，淮扬菜非常特别：不以所在省份命名。这让不少人以为，淮扬菜就是淮安、扬州一带的风味菜——如此认知，是时候刷新一下了。





淮扬菜的“淮”字，指的是以淮安为代表的淮河中下游流域；“扬”字，则指代以扬州为代表的扬子江（长江）流域。广义的淮扬菜系，包括整个长江中下游、淮河及连接两者的京杭大运河流域，是一片很广阔的地域。



这块土地，除了物产丰隆、人文繁盛，更拥有水网密布、四通八达的地理优势。淮河东西奔流，大运河沟通南北，恰好在此相会；它们邂逅之处，便是今天的淮安。南来北往的食客与食材在此碰撞，撞出了中国最会吃的一群人，以及考究的淮扬美味。



若论淮扬菜的江湖地位，开国第一宴由它唱主角，这名…]]></summary>

本周话题：元宇宙会成功吗
前不久，脸书的老板扎克伯格接受专访。
记者提问，为啥你们公司要改名为 Meta（元宇宙）？

记者的言下之意是，元宇宙这么虚幻的东西，科幻小说家炮制出来的概念。改成这个名字，你们会不会是一时头脑发热，追求时髦，能做成功吗？

扎克伯格的回答很棒，没有说外交辞令，而是说了两个很实在的理由，表明他认真算计过成功的可能性。
他说，根据统计，大多数美国成年人每天看电视（包括流媒体）或者玩电子游戏的时间，长达几个小时。电视节目或电子游戏，本质上都是提供了一个虚拟世界，让观众和玩家脱离现实，感受到快乐。
这表明人们愿意在虚拟世界里面，每天待上几个小时，哪怕现在的体验还非常初级。

第二个理由是，疫情期间，许多人都在家办公。以前，上班的目的地是办公室，现在变成了键盘和显示器。
这表明，人们可以在计算机前面工作8小时。如果能够提供更好的虚拟办公条件，这8小时完全可以在虚拟空间里面度过。

扎克伯格的结论就是，人们愿意待在虚拟世界，进行娱乐和工作。 元宇宙的需求真实存在，而且这种需求很大，只要能够创造更好的体验，就会诞生一个空前的市场。

我被扎克伯格说动了，突然意识到，虚拟世界真的很受欢迎，这是元宇宙可能成功的最大原因。
甚至可以这么说，如果我们把虚拟世界等同于元宇宙，那么可以发现，元宇宙早就成功了。
西游记是元宇宙。
星球大战是元宇宙。…]]></summary>

Unfortunately, companies aren’t great at writing secure software. Contrast Security wants to change that.
Jeff Williams, Co-founder & CTO of Contrast Security, and Steve Wilson, CPO, join the Dev Interrupted podcast to discuss the future of application security (AppSec), the importance of security automation and why the traditional way of doing security - where you scan app after app a few times a year - is over.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



By the numbers: the average application is attacked 13,000 times a month

And has over 35 vulnerabilities

The reasons AppSec should to be automated
How to reduce the cost of AppSec
Why shifting left doesn't result in more secure code

public class Welcome

And we create a Razor template for the email in EmailTemplates/Welcome.cshtml:

While messing around on Discord, I found a discussion about this language and how it was useful in web development. It wasn't very long and not all that interesting, but they said something that really caught my attention. 

I really like python and my focus is on web development, so why not try it out?
This thought was what made me start looking for online resources, a task that apparently I'm not intelligent enough to do, so I asked on Discord.
PHP is a scripting language specialized in web development and that can be embedded inside HTML and is executed on the server, meaning no shady scripts running on the client computer and more freedom working with sensitive data.

PHP can be manually installed by itself, or so I was told, but the easiest way when learning is through those already configured packages, like WAMP, LAMP and XAMPP. People from discord recommended using XAMPP, so I'll be sticking with it for now. Having installed it, everything left is understanding how it works.]]></summary>

COBRA KAI takes place over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).

As Samantha and Miguel try to maintain the dojo alliance and Robby goes all in at Cobra Kai, the fate of the Valley has never been more precarious. What tricks does Kreese have up his sleeve?

You'll need:
Coc 
emmet
install neovim


Install vim-plug (or any other plugin manager)
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug


I recommend checking out my dotfiles which has lots of comments so you can find any extra features that might be helpful for you.



I will write another post for a more in-depth description of getting started with neovim...
To install Coc, you'll want to follow their instructions at the link below. It is 
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
With neovim open, type the following:
:CocConfig coc-html coc-tsserver coc-json coc-emmet  coc-prettier
Coc tsserver is for javascript, typescript, and JSX support
You'll want to create a shortcut for :call CocAction('format'). I have the following shortcut so that I can format my projects with space + f:
nnoremap <leader>f :call CocAction('format')<CR>
head over to the Node.js downloads page and follow their installation instructions. You can also use your package manager to install Node. 
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo pacman -S nodejs
I highly recommend installing tmux so you can run your frontend, backend, neovim, and git cli in the same terminal window which makes it way easier to keep your workspace clear. Tmux is great because you can name your sessions and easily navigate to the right spot for what you're looking to do.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I planned how to contribute to an open source project last week and wrote about it in my previous blog. In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!
For the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I've decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college's C language course notes. The issue I'm working on is about "Standardize frontmatter across all pages". When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.
I've done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:
Added id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages
Each property of frontmatter was unified in order
Unified format of description
Shortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the <meta name="description" content="..."/> inside the <head>tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)
Added "Standardize frontmatter" to the CONTRIBUTING.md file
PR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143




  
  
  Getting reviews and change requests


One of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo's owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I'm familiar with the course notes, but I wasn't very good at C language.
The goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn't change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.]]></summary>

Responsible AI in practice
The rapid development of AI will have a big impact on nearly every aspect of private and professional life. The determination of that impact’s success should be judged by how ethically and responsibly the technology is created. With laws not being able to keep up with the pace that AI is being developed, it falls on companies and developers to make a responsible product.

The benefit of a logical operator is to connect two (or more!) expressions so that the value of the total (all of the expressions you just connected) is dependent on those expressions. 
These operators are used within code to compare variables and values when creating various logic methods, often using their boolean values. When used within functions it gives more logic options for the code to use and change based on user behavior. This can also help DRY up code in condensing functions.
The NOT ! operator is generally used as a boolean. Logical NOT will have truthy value if the operator it's called on (like !(6 === 3) is false and vice-versa (like !(6 === 6) is considered a false value. Here's a different way of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Managing Dependencies with go.mod


A project's dependencies are declared in the go.mod file. This is where the modules are stored when you do go get <module name>. You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. 
When you clone a Go project from github, for example, you'll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you're coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. 
You may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn't have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project's go.mod file. 
For example:
github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn't have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc. You would then have github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc // indirect in your project's go.mod file. 
note: the above is a hypothetical scenario, you won't actually have any indirect dependencies with github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2
go.sum includes the checksum for the dependencies to make sure that you're installing the exact same dependency as the author used. 
To create a new Go project where you can have a go.mod file, you need to set it up on your GOPATH with a name for your project. 
Running go mod init <module name>
You need to run go mod init before you're able to get dependencies for your project with go get]]></summary>

The great thing about having a podcast is that I have an "excuse" to ask questions to people I admire and want to learn from!
Recently I got to interview Cassidy Williams (@cassidoo
) and she has more than 170K followers on Twitter!! I won't lie, I was quite nervous... But she was super nice and the interview went really well.
Here are the top 3 things I learned from Cassidy:
1- Be humble and genuine
2- Some companies want access to your social media
she keeps all the control over her social media. With more than 170K followers I guess that many companies could use it for personal marketing...
3- Don't be afraid to experiment
that rule is BS! Cassity was never afraid to leave a job where she was not happy and that gave her the opportunity to experiment with different types of companies and find which ones she prefers to work at.
These are just 3 of a lot of lessons I took from my casual chat with Cassidy Williams. Would love to hear your thoughts on the interview. What questions did I miss? You can listen to the full chat here]]></summary>

Conductor allows you to create tasks that can process JSON payloads in your workflows without writing custom code using jq.  
JSON is a popular format of choice for data-interchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[就像我之前一直说的，即便是电动车，也一样拥有驾驶乐趣，特别是在优秀的调校加持下，更是如此。
作为一个小马力前驱车驾驶员，能得出这样的结论，跟我前不久驾（bai）驶（嫖）的一台车有很大关系，那就是小鹏的P7高性能版，那期节目相信很多人都还有印象。

1.底盘结构影响操控感
其实，要搞懂这个问题，我们最先该聊的，根本就不是动力形式，而最重要的东西，是底盘设计。
什么样的底盘才是“键盘值最高”或者说比较理想的结构呢？这个问题可能问100个人会有100种答案，但是放心，其中出镜率最高的，绝对是两种，双叉臂和多连杆。考虑到造车理念，成本还有布置空间等一系列的问题，现在市面上能见到的，“最具键盘值”的底盘结构非前双叉臂后多连杆莫属了。

保时捷确实前桥使用的麦弗逊，但是人家的调校功力和开发预算并非常规厂家能比的，因此它的厉害并不影响我们以上的结论。

这个结构市场上确实不算是很多见，但是其实有这么几款电动车都用了这个结构，像特斯拉Model 3、小鹏P7、蔚来ET7等这些车型。



而且在使用这个结构的同时，基本上都顺手把能用铝合金的部件都用上了铝合金。这其实跟这些“新势力”厂商开发新车基本上都没有上代车型有很大关系，我要是造车从零开始的话，我肯定也会选择用一个至少从理论上要表现更好的结构啊。


2.调校也很重要
结构不错是个基础，但是接下来的调校也是一关考验，就好像一个钢琴，再是好牌子，调音师是个业余的门外汉，出来的产品也并不会非常优秀的。都说保时捷造车造的好，开着感受好，其实，里面不光是投资，更是有着一个优秀且专业的团队在背后默默付出。什么？你说养不起这么大的团队？那好办，保时捷旗下的保时捷工程公司能够随时成为你的供应商，帮你调车。

没错，保时捷旗下有这么一家名为保时捷工程的公司，这家公司的技术团队有保时捷工程是的实力，这个团队不造车，但是会参与到有需求的厂家的造车过程中，也…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计师Calvin。大约2010年，我有幸涉足了DNF、QQ炫舞、疾风之刃、QQ飞车等产品的影视宣传，随即便入了游戏行业的坑，直奔琳琅天上工作室（也就是现在的天美），开启了我十年的游戏美术设计生涯。
作为老飞车玩家，秉持着对飞车的喜爱，这十年来，我一直从事QQ飞车的制作。从起初的端游场景赛道设计，到现在端/手游双端场景设计、IP包装、CG........每一个环节都留下了我努力搬砖的身影。
工作之余，我喜欢画画、模玩、游戏，也喜欢旅游，因此看到这个话题，我想我可以简单地向大家分享一下我的观点。
先说结论，我认为游戏是有潜力带动旅游业的，尤其是在疫情隔离的影响之后，如何鼓励人们从宅在家，到有意愿出去散心走走，一个好的办法，就是让大家在游戏中去看见，甚至体验旅游景地的美好风景与人文温度。
身为休闲赛车游戏《QQ飞车手游》的美术负责人，近几年我们一直在尝试将游戏与现实中的景点结合，比如今年我们与四川省旅游宣传促进中心合作，在游戏里推出了“梦回古蜀”与“云游天府”两条全新赛道，去一站式、沉浸式地呈现现实中的三星堆博物馆与四川的人文风貌。

“梦回古蜀”赛道展示的“古”，是四川的历史沉淀。玩家驾车驶入庞大的三星堆博物馆，在曲折幽暗的地宫回廊中穿梭，一路经过巨大的青铜立人像与太阳神鸟，去丈量和感受那神秘厚重的古蜀文明，体验一种冒险感。




与之相比，“云游天府”赛道则展现的是“今”，是四川的现代生活。在乐山大佛的脚下，坐卧着岁月静好的山城，有川剧变脸、蜀绣隽美、熊猫嬉闹，也有火锅串串的飘香、麻将的热闹、宽窄巷子的风情，体验一种安逸巴适，人间烟火的生活氛围。




在社交平台和部分随机问卷调查中，有不少玩家称赞了四川主题赛道的设计，并希望我们推出更多地域文化与传统文化的联名赛道，并为自己的家乡打call。这确实让我们感到十分欢喜，也认定“游戏”与“文化旅游…]]></summary>

先码住～下周整理下思路详细回答
顺便 @没有文化的俗人 《街球江湖》漫画的编剧一起～回忆下这段痛并快乐着的日子呗～

2021/12/8     追加评论：
谢邀， 其实之前就想写写《街球江湖》的事，但每次提笔便放下，这真是个很难回答到问题：有太多想说的，关于创作本身，关于对行业的看法，关于一直以来我们团队所奉行的模式理念这些，但每次都是千头万绪无法找到开头的感觉。
直到上上周看到这个问题，忽然脑海中就崩出来上面那段总结，花了两周时间顺着上面这个思路重新捋了一下自己对《街球江湖》的看法



                               part1: 《街球江湖》是一部在慢慢变好看的漫画
创作背景
每次提到《街球江湖》创作，它的诞生背景总是个无法绕开的话题 —— 街球连载以来在读者中得到了很多好评，但客观来讲，从专业角度看，这部作品还存在很多不足。尽管如此，我也无论如何也想让大家知道，在它诞生但背后有一个为之倾注来了极大热情与专注，无论怎样都想让它变得更好的团队在不断滴努力。
街球项目起始于17年夏天，彼时我正经历第一次漫画创业的低谷，寄予厚望的《超级绿》因为资方战略调整而无奈终止，和助理们搬进朋友公司的二楼小隔间里，一边安抚大家一边寻找新项目。 
一个朋友发来一个漫画项目的委托问我有没有兴趣：一家影视公司想做篮球ip，提供剧本，找团队做成漫画。 


接下这个项目的原因有三个：
1. 篮球主题：可能是我的一厢情愿，我总认为自己可能是国漫圈里最适合制作篮球漫画的作者之一（实在是太不要脸来），也急需一部能炫技和展现实力的与众不同的漫画来东山再起。
2. 影视公司为开发篮球ip而制作漫画：对方影视公司希望先以漫画形式把故事内容展现给大众并获取一定影响力和观众反馈。这种在早期就开始…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从十月份开始，下半年购物季就拉开了帷幕。作为一个购物季扎堆的半年，不知道你有没有注意到这样的一个现象：我们彼此之间互相交流买买买、一起吐槽各路平台与商家套路的时候总是穿杂着一个话题—— 「XX 肯定在偷听我们说话，它广告推送的就是我们那天讨论的」。实际上，这是一个老生常谈的话题。抛开双十一这个特定的时间点，即便是在其他时候我们也能够听到类似的吐槽。
一说到「偷听」，人们马上就会想到隔墙有耳，两只耳朵竖起来的状态。过往的那些不美好的人生经验就会随之浮现并不断提醒自己提高警惕性。这种源自内心深处的不安让我们感到害怕。在马斯洛的需求层次理论当中，安全的需要是仅次于生理的。所以我们很自然地就会给予高度的关注。
荣格与共时性，图片来自维基百科
1920 年代，瑞士心理学家荣格提出了「共时性」的概念。荣格认为：

这些表面上无因果关系的事件之间有着非因果性、有意义的联系，这些联系通常取决于人的主观经验。人总是对巧合印象深刻。

不过，有时候仔细的考量一下，似乎广告推送的也并不总是那么准。这种「偷听」会不会又是一种巧合呢？就是说，App 推送的内容与我们工作与生活中遇到的一些事情恰巧重叠在一起，我们根据自身的人生经验将他们联系到了一起。我们所在意地精准推送又会不会像荣格的共时性中讲的那样？
那么，这些被吐槽的平台到底是否在偷听我们说话？或者更进一步讲，它们是否通过偷听我们说话，进而进行分析并精准广告推送呢？
通过手机「偷听」说话，进行精准推送的可能性有多大？
就单纯的技术而言，手机偷听其实并不是一件很难的事情，但同时，它也并不是一件很容易的事情。究竟通过「偷听」来进行精准的广告推送的可能性有多大，我们逐一往下看。
一般来讲手机悄悄地进行录音通常包括两种情况：一种是（用户授权后的）后台静默监听，一种是突破系统权限进行监听。
对于前者，App 通过静默在后台进行偷听的技术难度大，手机自带的操…]]></summary>

🎁 十二月 Pixel Feature Drop

作为 Pixel 用户，除了 Google 第一方待遇的系统更新支持，另一个众所周知的好处就是你的手机还能随着每个季度发布的 Pixel Feature Drop 收到更多新功能，即便是较早发布的设备往往也不例外。
本周，十二月份的 Pixel Feature Drop 正式开始面向现有 Pixel 手机推送，加入了一系列新功能，也包括对现有 Bug 的修复。
除了 Google 与宝马合作为 Pixel 6 系列新增的车钥匙功能之外，Pixel 6 Pro 还在本次更新之后启用了 UWB 超宽频功能，但目前只能用于提升 Nearby Share 就近分享功能的识别速度。
另一个本次新增功能是用于帮助听障困难者在嘈杂环境下对话的应用 Sound Amplifier：它可以使用手机的机器学习算法来自动过滤掉除对话内容之外的环境噪声：只需要在对话前将手机摄像头对准你与之交谈的对象并选取，放下手机之后便可以在嘈杂环境下正常对话，尽可能地降低外部噪音给听障用户带来的沟通困难。

基于离线模型识别附近播放歌曲的「Now Playing」功能也得到增强：Pixel 4 系列用户现在也可以将本地模型无法正确识别的歌曲手动上传至云端数据库来识别；同时也可以直接将识别出的歌曲标记为喜欢方便后续整理。

A natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.]]></summary>

Sometimes I find my models cluttered with a lot of things: relationships, attributes casting, scopes, custom methods, etc. 
When this happens, one thing I like to do is move my scopes in a dedicated builder. This post will show you how I do that. 
We are working with bunnies because cats are all over the place already and because of the pressure I get from Coton the Tige. 🐰

Let's spin up our artisan command to create the model with the migration flag (-m) and the factory flag (-f):

I purchased it during my first trip to An Event Apart in 2007. This book meant a lot to me back then, and almost 15 years later, many of its concepts still hold true.
The premise of the book is that designs should be "bulletproof" to accommodate the many ways they can be used.
I'm using the term bulletproof partly to describe flexibility—in other words, designs for the web that can easily accommodate various text sizes and amounts of content, designs that expand or contract along with whatever is placed within them.

If you run Node in production, sooner or later you'll come across a common bug known as a memory leak.
This was the case with my current side project, expose. I wrote a popular article Six Ways To Drastically Boost Your Productivity As A Node Developer which mentioned it, then suddenly the server was overloaded.
During the period of high load, I could see that a memory leak was forming.
expose?


expose is a command line app that makes its simple to give a public URL to any web based app you have running locally on your machine. So if you have a local API runnig at http://localhost:8000 and you then run expose 8000, it will generate a public URL that you can then share.

Dependencies and why they’re important in reproducibility
Configuration files and how to make them useful across different environments
Backing services, what they are and how decoupling gives your app more flexibility

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok "For You Page"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!

最近，平地刮起一阵“鸭屎”风。一款叫“鸭屎香”的茶异军突起，突然横扫了大大小小奶茶店的菜单。
某些头部奶茶品牌直接玩起“花活儿”，把一系列“鸭屎香”做底的奶茶丢进菜单。C位的鸭屎香宝藏茶包装更叫勇猛，“鸭屎香”三个硕大的黑字印在橙色的纸杯上，旁边还此地无银地注明“我真的很香”。


微博上，话题“鸭屎香奶茶到底有多好喝”快被网友玩坏了。有的网友秉持考据精神，发帖称“帮你们试过了，没有鸭屎味”；有的则随性表示“鸭屎香真好喝，我又激情下单了”。


这款顶着“鸭屎”之名的茶到底是什么？它所代表的“名称劝退”派食物在中国是一个隐藏的狠人派别，各种硬核气味、诡异生物在这个门派中争奇斗艳。敢不敢上车来一波？


战胜鸭屎香，
还有一堆来自洪荒的气味在等你
鸭屎香的走红，一半以上的功劳来自“鸭屎”二字，猎奇的名字是打开年轻人心扉的钥匙，但鸭屎香，它到底是鸭屎味，还是香味？


鸭屎香到底是什么味？
鸭屎香名字虽野，却正儿八经出身名门，是潮汕茶叶大族凤凰单枞的直系。凤凰单枞产于潮州凤凰山附近，是乌龙江湖里出了名的耐冲泡、强回甘、香气高扬，江湖人称“茶中香水”，香到经常被误会加了香精的那种。

甚至有粉丝放过狠话：“铁观音‘七泡有余香’就让人津津乐道了，而凤凰单枞茶，你完全可以把前七泡直接倒掉！连最普通的凤凰单枞都可以冲十二泡以上。”算你狠！
凤凰单枞甚至直接用香型来命名品种，只要在市面上看到什么黄枝香、芝兰香、蜜兰香、桂花香、肉桂香、茉莉香，那都是凤凰一族的。
从这种意义上来说，鸭屎香还真的没有虚假宣传，它是真的香。

至于为什么以“鸭屎”命名，流行的说法有两种。一说它引进后种在“鸭屎土”（即黄土壤）上；二说因为当地人喝过之后都说好，茶农怕被人偷去，便丑化命名，谎称这叫鸭屎香。

鸭屎香虽然不是最老的品种，但这些年在凤凰家族里已小有名气。它易…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021-2022 的秋季校招又拉开了帷幕。在今年的秋招中，我依然作为业务条线代表参与了全职和暑假实习生的简历筛选、面试和终选的全过程。这几年来，我都会在四季度集中经手两百余份简历。作为一个面试官，我每年都会为不少面试者扼腕叹息：从简历上我可以看得出申请人资质非常不错，但是他/她却不经意间犯了一个或多个「小错误」，导致最后我不得不忍痛割爱。而且，这些错误往往不会在常见的简历教程中提到。
在展开下文之前，我还是想强调一下：简历是非常个性化的产物，因人而异，因公司、岗位、行业而异，切不可一概而论。本文旨在从一家金融机构面试官的角度讨论类似行业的简历「避坑指南」，仅供参考。
你的简历在第一关会经历什么
申请者在网站上提交申请资料之后，人力资源部（HR） 会在网申临近结束或结束以后将资料全部导出，并进行第一步筛选。第一步筛选一般由电脑自动完成，主要确保申请者符合岗位的基本要求（如毕业年度、学历、材料是否齐全等）。如果有在线测试（如 SHL）的话，HR 也会设置一条分数线进行初步筛选。但从多年的经验来看，在线测试的分数线更像是一条及格线（比如 60 分），并不会过于苛刻。
在初步筛选之后，所有的网申材料都会打包提交给业务部门进行第二轮的筛选。这第二轮的筛选就是由业务经理进行的人工筛选了。一般我们会以简历为主，结合网申材料、开放式问题、在线测试成绩和近两年新增的视频回答进行一轮筛选，并给申请人分为三类：Yes、No、Maybe。在每一位的申请材料都审阅完毕后，我们会先考虑各个面试官手中标明 Yes 的应聘者，然后综合讨论所有的待定应聘者，填补剩余的面试席位。
在之后每一轮的面试、活动当中，之前所有的材料（包括网申、简历、以及每一轮评审的评论）都会一起交给下一轮的面试官。在这当中，简历又是每一轮面试官在见到本人之前，最直接了解应聘者的机会。因此，简历的重要性不言而喻。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[被子弹击穿的水壶
急救包、绷带、医疗剪……在展柜中依次整齐排列。


它们曾属于同一个人：年轻的卫生员贠宝山。


紧挨着医疗剪，一只金属水壶静静安放，壶身上浑圆的弹孔，铭刻着一段浸透血色的往事。


1951年秋天，抗美援朝战场上，炮火连绵，鲜血浸染了中马山的泥土。贠宝山穿过硝烟，抚摸一具具失去声息的身体，找寻还存活的战友救治。


战斗胶着，敌人动用了大量飞机火炮，向战场上倾泻数万吨炮弹，呛人的烟尘弥漫在阵地之上，携着火光的弹头肆无忌惮地穿梭飞射，贠宝山远远望见几十米外，班长倒在地上。


枪林弹雨，火光冲天。这短短几十米想要越过去，却难过万水千山。


就在此时，一颗炮弹猝不及防在贠宝山身旁爆炸，他一瞬间晕了过去。


等贠宝山恢复意识时，他的肠子已经顺着鲜血流到地上……


那场战斗中，贠宝山用尽最后的力气，挣扎着爬到班长身边，想要拿起水壶喂水时，却发现那只水壶早就被子弹击穿，里面的水几乎流尽。贠宝山就握着这个被击穿的水壶，永远遗憾地合上了双眼。


展柜里，被封存的水壶早已洗去血痕，或许只有斑驳的磨痕和凹凸的表面，还残留着那段烽火岁月的印记。


一旁展板上，短短数十字介绍，铭刻了一个年轻生命的终点。黑白图案定格了贠宝山的面容。照片上那个圆脸稚嫩的年轻人，牺牲于22岁的秋日——


1951年9月7日，中马山战斗中，志愿军第42军第125师第375团9连卫生员贠宝山奋勇抢救伤员，负伤后坚持不下火线，因伤势过重牺牲。立特等功，授“一级英雄”荣誉称号。


2020年10月，为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战70周年，中国人民革命军事博物馆举办主题展览，将贠宝山的故事和那只水壶纳入其中。


2020年11月，抗美援朝纪念馆网站中，一位名叫贠佳峰的网友在线上烈士名录中找到了贠宝山的名字，留言道：“致敬英雄！致敬我的爷爷！您是中国人民的骄傲！是我们永远的榜样！”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[众所周知，去年的 macOS Big Sur 再一次更新了视觉设计风格，其中一项改动就是「焕然一新」的工具栏。至于焕然一新在哪……最明显的地方就是更大的额头。

这样的设计好不好看见仁见智，但有一点是肯定的：这么多的空间如果浪费就太可惜了。 以文件管理器 Finder 为例，尽管系统已经提供了一系列功能图标来充实工具栏，但仍不一定能满足我们的要求。
实际上，Finder 一直以来都允许用户向工具栏添加任意文件夹、文件或者应用程序图标。 这项功能宣传得很少，但实用性很强，在「大额头」设计的今天更是显得尤其应景。
至于方法，也极其简单，按住 Command ⌘ 键，然后将任何文件夹、文件或者应用程序的图标拖拽到想要安放的位置，松手即可。

通过这种方法添加到工具栏中的文件夹和应用，在功能上类似于 Dock 中的图标，兼有「传送门」和「篮子」两种功能，换言之：

如果直接点击，则可以打开对应的文件夹或启动应用程序
如果将某个文件图标拖动到图标上，则可以将该文件移动到对应的文件夹内，或用对应的应用程序打开该文件。

由于工具栏的「区位优势」，通过这种方法适当添加常用文件夹和应用图标，可以有效减少在整理、编辑文件时需要拖动鼠标的距离，优化操作效率。
如果想让工具栏排布显得更有序，还可以在工具栏空白处点击右键，选择「自定义工具栏」，然后拖拽添加一些「间隙」，为图标建立视觉上的分组效果。
个人而言，我习惯在工具栏添加「桌面」和「下载」文件夹图标，这样可以随时切换到这两个常用位置或将文件移动过去；应用程序图标则添加了 VS Code 和 iTerm 2，以便快速以纯文本形式查看文件，或者切换到命令行环境继续操作。
如果在添加图标后想要重新调整顺序，可以再次按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标拖动。如果想要删除已添加的图标，按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标将图标扔出工具栏即可。]]></summary>

Stepping into a DMV when you're about to take your first driver's test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral "drivers license" (hence the DMV locale and its "interesting vibes.") Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and so…]]></summary>

I recently got myself into the situation where all my local git repos had the wrong remote addresses.  This was caused by a change up on our git account.  
You can see the url that git is currently using by opening the 'config' file in the .git folder.  You'll see it under the '[remote "origin"]' section.
Luckily this is pretty trivial to fix.  You can either update the url directly in the config file, or run the following command...
git remote set-url origin new.git.url/xyz]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's me explain with a simple example:
console.log('First log');
console.log('Second log');
console.log('Third log');

As we can see, every line of code will waits for previous line to complete execution before execute next line. this is called with synchronous.
Here another example:
console.log('First log');
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('Second log');
},2000)
console.log('Third log')

setTimeout function will wait for milisecond time that set in second argument and executes anonymous function in the first arguments
First log
Third log
undefined
Second log

As we can see, Third log does not wait for Second log to execute, the method of not waiting for the previous code to complete is called asynchronous.
The best way to use asynchronous is when your website working with server to fetching data or getting response, instead of waiting all data from server fully loaded that maybe takes more than one minutes (depend on speed of your internet and server speed to resolve request) you could use asynchronous to make sure that code ahead will execute and javascript will not waiting server response to complete.]]></summary>

Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one. Because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy ten minute videos and unfortunately, reality is, well, complicated. The question of how we deal with that, is central to what we do on this channel and something we think about a lot.

I'll be covering how to create a resell item feature to your marketplace, since this was an issue to me and to other developers to whom I have talked to. 
First, in the NFT contract, we'll add a function to transfer the token. You may be asking why I don't just simply use ERC721's tranferFrom function. And the reason is that when I tested my functions, in some situations requests reverted with "transfer caller is not owner nor approved", even though msg.sender === ownerOf(tokenId) asserted true. So my solution was to write a custom transfer function. But feel free to share the solution for this stra…]]></summary>

Usually we know how to place a search for users without vision disabilities. But how should we do that for users with disabilities?
There is a special search role in the WAI-ARIA standard that we should add for the form element. In this case screen readers will start to display search in the "Regions list" mode that is used by users for navigation.
Pay attention, if we don't do that search will not be displayed in this mode. So it will hamper users start interaction with search. They will have to find a search using common keys. It's much longer than if they use the "Regions list" mode.

Did you think sometimes about how better to move focus when users open elements such as modals or dialogs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.
A couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. 
The specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh
 posted this:
Dev.to as a headless CMS
Visakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read
#react
        #javascript
        #webdev
        #opensource
      
This was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.
You've probably noticed several deprecations lately. It's all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.]]></summary>

I started my career as a software engineer five years ago after working a job as a developer at a small startup that just needed hands and thoughts which I kinda see as my boot camp experience.
I started my "engineering" career at a larger, yet still small startup in San Francisco, where I learned a lot, but not enough to become a senior there. I did primarily backend work with a spattering of frontend excursions. I got close to senior at that company. So close that my manager wasn't able to pinpoint anything specific to work on.

Step 1: Create origin server
Step 2: Create a reverse proxy server
Step 3: Forward a client request to the origin server (via reverse proxy)
Step 4: Copy origin server response to the client (via reverse proxy)
Common errors
Conclusion



Proxy server is a server that provides a gateway between the client (Alice) and the origin server (Bob). Instead of connecting directly to the origin server (to fulfill a resource request), client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required action a origin server on the client behalf (e.g. get current time).

        <updated>2021-12-07T10:37:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[事实上，平台的老旧对产品品质的影响还是很重要的，所以我们在买车的时候非常有必要了解对意向车型的生产平台进行了解。
举例，比如一款车换代车型即将上市，旧款（上一代）车型依然在售，如果这时候买了旧款就有些可惜了，相当于是买到了上一代的技术。那如果二手车呢？举个典型例子，都是登记日期在2018-2020年之间的丰田卡罗拉，价格差别不大，车况各有不同。如果你了解12代卡罗拉来自TNGA平台，11代卡罗拉于2019年7月停产，在车况和价格没有太大差别情况下，就一定要选择车身铭牌的出厂日期在2019年7月之后的12代卡罗拉(也可以看后悬架，扭力梁的都是老平台车型)。

为什么？当然是冲着TNGA平台啊，比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构（更准确说法是架构）所产车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。这也就是说来自TNGA架构的第12代卡罗拉，操控性能和驾驶乐趣，包括安全性方面比上一代车型有了显著提高。同样的，这也适用于凯美瑞，只是凯美瑞两代车型之间外观内饰有明显区别，比较不容易混在一块儿（买二手车时）。

尽管平台的最大意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而帮企业节省成本，但从消费者的角度，理论上，新的造车平台比旧（上一代）的更加先进和高级。因此，他也能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。
比如说，大众现在MQB平台的车型，比上一代PQ25/35平台产品在轻量化方面就有了明显提高，用户获得的好处自然是节约了油费。前面也提到了，丰田TNGA架构下的新一代车型，操控方面都比以往有了显著提高，哪怕卡罗拉这样的标准“买菜车”，开起来也不再平庸乏味。
再看现在流行的电动车，以往很多电动车往往是“油改电”的过渡性产品，会在电机、电池摆布、车内空间、行驶及安全品质等方面出现很多不够完善的地方，而来自全新的纯电车造车平台的电动车就很好地解决了这一问题。

总的来说，新旧平台的产品尽量选新的，但凡事没绝对，某些新平台车型的某些细节甚至还不如旧平台车型，比如PQ46的斯柯达昊锐，反而比MQB平台的速派，在底盘厚重感、转向手感方面主观感受更好。此外，老款车型在产品生涯末期往往有较大优惠，如果一些产品点上的差异消费者本身也不是很敏感，那倒也没有什么。  

如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。
目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。

但是，并不是喜欢树莓派的所有人都有计算机科学的背景，相当大一部分小白都在通过关注极客玩家们的教程，一步一步跟着教程操作来复刻他们做出来的东西。可是，尽管有了教程的帮助，小白在实际操作的过程中也还是会遇到很多失败的情况且不知道如何独立解决。
所以我打算向大家介绍 Balena 这个一站式的解决方案。
Balena： 完整的生态
Balena 是一套完整用于开发、部署、管理 IOT 设备，并提供了云用于连接这些 IOT 设备们的工具和服务。它包括了：

balenaEngine 是一个为嵌入式设备优化的运行引擎，等同于 Docker 的存在，但胜在软件体积更小，需要传输的镜像层更小，内存占用也更少。
balenaOS 是一个极简的 Linux 系统，不同于 Raspberry Pi OS，仅包含了 balenaEngine 以及一些必要的系统组件，使得硬件资源能够被最大化目标软件的使用，但借助 Balena 的其他服务，又可以很轻松的部署我们想要的工具。。
balenaHub 是一个类似 Github 的地方，开发者把软件装载进 balenaOS 中并发布到这里，用户可以从这里免费下载已经打包好的「系统镜像」。
balenaEtcher 是一个开源跨平台的系统镜像烧录工具，有精美易用的 UI 界面，可以把上述系统镜像烧录到 tf 卡中，然后插入树莓派直接开始使用。
balenaFin 一个建立于树莓派计算模块之上的开发板，有更好的存储和电源扩展等。

        <id>http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2021/12/web3.html</id>
        <link href="http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2021/12/web3.html"/>
        <updated>2021-12-07T04:09:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。
下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。

一、历史回顾
Web 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。

Web 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。

二、Web3 的特征
Web3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。

我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。
Web 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。
娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。
在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。
三、虚拟世界
所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。
到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。
四、Web3 是分布式的
这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！
这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：
（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；
（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。
五、区块链的作用
如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。
这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。
一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。
另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。
六、数字资产
区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。
如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。

举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。
我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。
我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。
创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说："Web3 就是所有权"，就是这个意思。

如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。
目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。

玉龙雪山

来古冰川

梅里雪山

然乌湖的月光

星空

路上偶然遇见的河




这一次，我们两家、六人、一辆房车，从丽江出发到拉萨，然后原路返回。美景的图片集锦已经发过了，今天就发一发这一路记录的日记吧。。。
28日 第一天 大理到丽江到香格里拉
早上7点半，我们迎着大理的朝霞出发了，第一站就是去丽江的房车生活家提车点取房车。
在沟通了解房车事项近五个小时之后，我们终于出发了，奔向我们的目的地，西藏。这对于我们，对于四岁的孩子们来说，将是一个未知又充满惊喜的挑战！
特意从丽江玉龙雪山脚下转了一圈后，晚上我们到达香格里拉古城附近的广场。逛了夜晚的独克宗古城，给开了一天车的爸爸们补充能量，吃了一顿牦牛肉大餐。
夜晚的香格里拉真冷啊，让我们几个大人有了一种回到大学宿舍的感觉，水是刺骨的，但想象着我们领略着世界第三极绝美的风光，心中就充满了期待。







29日 香格里拉到梅里雪山
前一晚的房车睡眠着实让人为接下来越来越冷的行程捏一把汗，一边担心孩子们受冻着凉，一边又不甘心就这样放弃掉。好在云南冬日的阳光总是让人感觉到温暖，上午推开房车门的阳光消除了所有的担心，我们决定带着孩子坚持走下去。
洗漱完毕就踏上了最爱的菜市场环节，香格里拉的菜市场，有堆成尖的奶酪，有黄色的白色的，我们在好奇心驱使下买了一块“甜的奶酪”，结果让人难以入口，像吃坏掉的奶渣一样，可能这种美食我们的嘴是无福消受了。但是买到的牦牛肉、藏香猪和苹果让我们重拾信心，出发前我们就定好了要买这边的肉做烤肉，买到了就刻不容缓，直奔野营地——浓雾顶。那是在图片上才能看到平视梅里雪山的地方，运气好就能看到日出金山和梅里雪山的顶峰。带着几分祈祷，我们又踏上了路途。
晚上周转了很久才在寻问下找到了露营地，可惜太晚了天已经黑了，我们围坐在篝火旁，吃起了新鲜的牦牛肉，孩子们在旁边刨坑挖土，做着扮演…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
随着安全和隐私意识的增强，越来越多的人已经在提供手机号、银行卡号时越发慎重，也知道每一个服务都要尽量使用不同的随机强密码。相比之下，邮箱地址的安全性此前受到的关注并不够充分。其实，邮箱地址也是个人信息的一部分，在交出之前值得多加提防。想象一下，如果能每一次注册都使用不同的随机匿名邮箱，是不是也很酷？
其实，这样的匿名邮箱服务正在变得主流。在 9 月推出的 iOS 15 上，Apple 更新了「iCloud+」功能，其中就包含一项名为「Hide My Email」的匿名邮箱服务；11 月 16 日，Firefox 浏览器也推出了类似的 Firefox Relay 功能。算上之前入局的 Fastmail、DuckDuckGo 等，匿名邮箱的选择前所未有地多。本文中，我们就对这些主流的匿名邮箱服务做一比较，帮助大家选择。
邮箱别名——简易版邮箱匿名方案
在正式对比之前，有必要简单提几句「邮箱别名」（alias）功能。这项功能早在很久之前就被不少邮箱服务所支持，可以看作一种简易版的匿名邮箱方案。具体而言，别名相当于邮箱地址的一个「小号」或「昵称」，发到别名的邮件会和主邮箱共享收件箱。
加号地址
创建别名最简单、通用的方法就是在邮箱地址的域内部分（即俗话说的用户名）后面加上加号（「+」）和任意字符串，常用的 Gmail、Outlook、iCloud 等邮箱服务均支持这个技巧。（加号地址是由 RFC5233 标准定义的，该标准并没有限制用什么符号作为别名的分隔符，但实践中绝大多数邮件服务都采用加号。）
举个例子，你有一个邮箱地址是 sspai@gmail.com，那么发送给 sspai+aaa@gmail.com、sspai+bbb@gmail.com 的邮件都会发送到 sspai@gmail.com 这个地址。
方便是方便，但如果是出于隐私保护而这么做，会有两个问题：

很容易…]]></summary>

I just finished creating a few small lambda functions using Python.
My project needed the following libraries:
requests for making HTTP requests.
pysftp for creating SSH connections to different servers. 
If you need a different library, the approach should be the same, assuming it's installable using pip or pip3. 
Unfortunately we didn’t have access to Container Registry (ECR) so we couldn't create a docker container, which would have allowed us to install the dependencies as part of the docker container creation.
We instead had to create & upload a zip file containing our application code and dependencies.
While we could include the application dependencies in the zip we upload, this has a few disadvantages:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[继 Beats Studio Buds 在 7 月推出之后，没想到还没半年时间，Beats 今年还有新品发布。与前者一样，Beats 最新推出的 Beats Fit Pro 是一款真无线蓝牙降噪耳机，不同的是，这款耳机搭载了 Apple H1 芯片，除了主动降噪和通透模式，它还支持空间音频、iCloud 同步、自动切换等新功能，售价 1,599 元。

外观设计
Beats Fit Pro 的充电盒与 2019 年推出的 Powerbeats Pro 类似，方形圆润的设计，尺寸比后者稍小、比 AirPods Pro 的充电盒更大一些。类肤质材质的运用也是现在 Beats 产品的「标配」。类肤质材质表面的缺点也很明显，容易沾染指纹、油污，需要经常清洁；当然，好处是不容易产生划痕等不可修复的损伤。

虽然充电盒尺寸接近 Powerbeats Pro，Beats Fit Pro 的耳机大小可是实实在在地小了不少，尺寸与 AirPods Pro 和 AirPods 可以说是差不多一致。同样作为入耳式耳机，由于没有「侵入感」明显的耳挂式设计，Beats Fit Pro 的佩戴体验自然比 Powerbeats Pro 要好上不少，个人认为与 AirPods Pro 的入耳感受接近。不同的是，Beats Fit Pro 用上了一个全新的耳翼式设计。

此前市面上采用耳翼式设计的耳机，多是提供了多个尺寸的可更换耳翼选择，以让用户实现稳定舒适的佩戴体验。Beats Fit Pro 则直接通过柔韧性更好的软性硅胶材料打造通用型耳翼，让耳翼能够根据不同耳形大小达到灵活弯折的效果，让不同用户都能轻松佩戴。
据 Beats 介绍，Beats Fit Pro 的耳翼基于人体工学设计，外形和选材经过大量用户的运动数据测试和验证，不仅耐用、稳定，还优化了耳机的佩戴贴合度和⻓时间佩戴的舒适度，确保声学性能不…]]></summary>

We started a book club! Each week we host a Twitter chat on Thursdays to discuss a chapter of Docs for Developers. 
On Thursday Dec. 2nd we had our second Twitter chat, hosted on the @DevEdBookClub Twitter account about Chapter 2. 
This post is a recap of the chat and a place to continue the conversation.

In this tutorial, We will learn to use the speedtest library to test your internet Speed. We'll also learn how to use speedtest command lines.
Let's get started. 
To install speedtest via pip, follow this command:
pip install speedtest-cli

After installing the speedtest package. Now, let's see how to use it with the code.
In the following code, I'll test my internet download speed.
import speedtest

# Speed test
st = speedtest.Speedtest()

# Download Speed
ds = st.download()

print(ds)

let me explain.
First, we import the speedtest package. Then, called Speedtest() class. Next, test my download speed using the download() method. Finally, print the result.

I bet you got that. #Smartdev
What is version control?
What is git?
How does git work?
What is GitHub?
What is the difference between git and GitHub?
It is a way to document the code you use for analysis. 
Git is a distributed Version Control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux Kernel, that makes tracking code over time easy and effortless.
Git:
Tracks iterative change that's made to the code one tells it to manage. Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.


It facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. 


Easily switches between Versions of your code.


Easily undo changes.




  
  
  What is GitHub?🤔


First, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
Git is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.
Git is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.
Can't be any simpler than that!!
Please make sure you leave a like 👍/loveheart ❤️ on this one. It encourages one to write more and more 🎉 🎊]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was working around a few days back, managing the release of the project with versioning and proper tags associated with it which results in writing the python code.
I have written a simple python function that will call the API of GitHub and will Create/Fetch /Delete the release on GitHub.
Note** You can manage the same with CURL command too but I was facing some authentication issue, so haven’t done, I haven’t tried with explicitly passing the auth token in header by -H tag, you can give a try.
Have a look at the below snippet of code which can be easily integrated with Jenkins pipeline
`# Begin
user = ""             #username of github account
https://api.github.com"
Here, tag_name and releaseId variables are only required if you want to delete a particular release, which you will rarely come across.
# Fetch latest release from github


The above code will be used to fetch the latest release present on GitHub.
# Create latest release on github


This snippet of code is used to create the release on GitHub, which contains payload in JSON format.
release.json will look something like below,
{


Even with this payload, you can easily create prerelease of the master branch, which can be tested in the Staging environment.
# Delete release from github by passing tag_name & releaseId


The above deletion method is not often required.
The full script is available in the below repository.
Github Link: https://github.com/nik0811/github-release-api.git
Feel free to comment below, if you will found any mistakes or required any type of modifications/enhancement. The code is fully tested so hopefully, you will not find any issues.]]></summary>

We know that when you think of samba, you immediately think of happy Brazilians dancing.

But.. We are so sorry because situation here is not quite what you think. (We know that you are trying to hide your bewilderment because we experienced the same at the beginning.)
So it always happens like this...

Now let's come to our main topic, what is the real samba we are talking about?
SAMBA is a project developed in 1991 by re-adapting the SMB network protocol as free software with reverse engineering methods.
However, it is also worth mentioning that the difference from the default SMB protocol to which it is implemented progresses in a path and version map.
For example, SAMBA 3 released in 2003, enabled the integration of file and printer services between GNU/Linux systems …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。
我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。
为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。
翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：
随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug
还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：
可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动
这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。
展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：
这个项目放弃前的一段录屏
我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。
所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！

在我卖掉 iPad Air 3 而买了 iPad mini 6 之后，就一直在为其物色一款合适的键盘。
之前 Air 3 一直使用的都是官方 Smart Keyboard：价格奇贵、手感奇差、还不能保护背面。但无需充电、吸上即用，拥有任何其他键盘都无法相比的一体性。
可惜的是，Apple 并未给 iPad mini 提供官方的键盘解决方案，而是仅注明了其支持「蓝牙键盘」。
iPad mini 仅支持蓝牙键盘
这并不奇怪，毕竟 iPad mini 的尺寸决定了它更偏向于一款内容消费设备，而非生产设备。不过这也不妨碍我为 mini 选配一款便携式的蓝牙键盘，以随时随地完成轻量的文字处理任务。
那些被我淘汰的备选项
我最先看中的是 Logitech 的 Keys-To-Go 键盘。作为上架 Apple Store 的产品，这款键盘有着简洁漂亮的外观和专为 iOS 设备优化的快捷键。同时，作为非折叠式的传统键盘，Keys-To-Go 的尺寸也只有 24.2*13.7 cm，仅仅比 iPad mini 6 (19.5*13.5 cm) 大上一点。抛开略显昂贵的售价 (¥480) 不谈，它的确是 iPad mini 的理想搭档。

不过，经过一番搜索，我也成功被 Keys-To-Go 的问题劝退了。首先是耐用性。有不少网友（1, 2, 3, 见评论区）都表示 Keys-To-Go 在使用一两年之后，可能会出现按键鼓包等现象，这样的耐用性让我很难把它当作「传家宝」。
有关按键鼓包的评论不少

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[游戏音频，即是存在于游戏世界里的一切声音，然而大家是否能够想象，在如今的一款开放大世界游戏中，存在的声音文件数量也许不是以千计，也不是以万计，而是以十万计。
在越来越庞大且复杂的游戏面前，游戏音频早已不是什么隐于背景中的音乐，仅由几位神秘的音乐艺术家就能闭门完成。在才华与灵感之外，AI 算法、机器学习、Object-Based Audio 技术、跨国合研等先进技术与模式，也已悄然融入游戏音频这块依旧让人略感陌生的领域。

游戏音频到底是什么？正在经历哪些新趋势？未来将如何发展？我们邀请到了来自天美音频中心的六位音频专家，其中有一直与天美共同成长的中国设计师，也有来自海外 3A 游戏厂商的外籍专家。他们将与我们分享对游戏音频的热爱，以及对其未来发展的展望。


—— 我认为非线性声音设计是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
大家好！我是 Beej Paz，我已经在游戏行业摸爬滚打了 13 年，加入天美之前，我在育碧担任音频总监。
游戏音频是我毕生热爱的事业，我认为非线性声音设计，是未来开启音频创意的关键。互动性和参与感是将声音与人联系起来的最佳途径，并且只能靠非线性声音设计，也就是游戏音频来实现。
当玩家在游戏中的决策/行动有了意义时，我们就能以此为切入点，让音频发挥作用。如果声音设计能够更贴近玩家、更具有意义，那么我们也能顺利建立起与玩家之间连接的纽带和信任。
音频带来的愉悦和沉浸感可以让玩家得到情感上的满足，塑造一个又一个的“感觉棒极了”的时刻。我们为玩家打造出的这些“魔力”时刻，不仅能够启发灵感，还将影响下一代从业者对未来游戏音频的观念。
我们总是从过去和现在的那些伟大前辈们身上得到启发，收获灵感。这是一种传承，我们这代游戏音频人就是这么过来的。

我主攻的方向是创意音频设计。我一开始入…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一个主打内容创作的社区，少数派中大家讨论最多的可能就是写作工具了，而其中以语法简单，专注于内容创作著称的 Markdown 编辑器则是其中的焦点，从以优雅的设计和易用性著称的 Ulysses 和 MWeb，再到主打同步的 Bear 等一系列写作工具，其实都向我们展示了 Markdown 这样一款语法简单的语言是如何真正的提高文字创作者效率的。而作为一位「老少数派」，我则从 2015年开始全面转向 Markdown 写作，只不过一开始我就在使用本文的主角—— Typora，一开始选择其实最看重的跨平台特性：在 Windows 平台上很难再找到一款颜值上线的 Markdown 编辑器了。

在发布首个测试版的之后的第六年，这款「纯粹」的 Markdown 编辑器也正式发布了首个 1.0 正式版。同时上线的还有其收费计划——买断式付费，可激活三台设备，如果大版本更新可能还要另外收费，费用为 89 元人民币。在习惯性「白嫖」六年后，正式宣布收费也引起了不小的争议，那么这样一款纯粹的 Markdown 编辑器是否真的值得付费？或许看完本篇全方面的测评，你会在心中留下你自己的答案。
真正意义上的全桌面平台支持
相比某些只是支持单一平台的 Markdown 编辑器，Typora 在最早期就开始对多个平台的支持，除了最为常见的 macOS 以及 Windows 之外，还支持 Linux 桌面环境，并且所有的平台的外观以及功能都保持了高度的一致。

而在本次 1.0 正式版中，Typora 进一步提供了几乎全桌面平台的支持，这里不仅仅是系统层面的，还包括系统架构。除了包含了在此前测试版中我们就已经熟知的 x86 /x86-64，还加入了对 ARM64 版 Windows 以及 Linux 的支持，尤其是在类似树莓派这样的单板电脑中，也有了设计美观的 Markdown 可用。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面：感谢天美同事帮我把想法翻译成了中文跟大家交流。以下所有配图都是公开图片，仅供专业探讨，所以请不要指望这里可以看到拳头或者育碧的机密信息；）
大家好，我是 Francois Dallaire，坐标新加坡，目前是天美 F1 工作室的技术美术专家（Principal Tehnical Artist），已有过十多年的技术美术从业经验。
多年来，中国手游在海外的成绩一直很亮眼，但直到近一两年，我们才逐渐看到中国游戏公司在 AAA 游戏研发上与日俱增的兴趣。
在此之前，很多 AAA 大作都有中国开发者参与，但大多是负责部分模块或者作为外包团队，很少能主导完整的项目。现在中国工作室开发自己的 AAA 项目，招揽和借助全球 AAA 人才的经验来起步也是很正常的事情。在西方，这种 AAA 公司间的人才流动早已成为常态。
与此同时，中国游戏公司在研发技术上的进步也很引人注目。比如 2018 年在游戏开发者大会（GDC）上亮相的虚拟人 Siren，展现了中国游戏公司对于次世代研发技术的探索，吸引了许多像我一样的全球游戏研发从业者的注意。我相信中国游戏开发者已经做好准备，迎接新的挑战。

随着中国游戏公司加入 AAA 游戏的全球化研发潮流，这成为了一个双向选择的过程。游戏公司在寻找特定领域的资深人才，而人才也在寻找有潜力的项目。
就我所知，技术相关的岗位往往最先受到关注，比如技术美术、技术动画等。经过种种考虑，我选择加入了有 13 年自研积累的天美，相信这里的项目会为我带来更广阔的职业前景。
全球化研发潮流下的技术美术
放在 15 年前，游戏行业还不存在技术美术（Technical artists，以下简称 TA）岗位，但随着行业的发展，TA 已越来越受重视，并成为当前中国游戏行业最紧缺的岗位之一。
我从事 TA 已有十余年的时间，入行之初也经历过一些变化。最初，我在动视做游戏测试（te…]]></summary>

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. 

Thanks to @Vort3xDragon for making the scavenger hunt, this was epic!

as seen in this tutorial?
1- Install @types/node in your project
$ yarn add @types/node -D

// or using npm

$ npm i @types/node -D

2- First of all, download the VSC extension TS Env Typings
3- Specify env-typings.json file in the root of your project.

4- Add path field to your development .env file

That's it, Enjoy!
1- Specify path for the generated output using output field in the JSON config.

2- Auto detect env variable type so that It can give you a nice example in the intellisense on how to use and parse it.
so as an example if you've a number env variable It'll tell you to use parseInt to parse it before using it cause env variables are always read as strings.

3- Variants for an env variable, so you tell the extension what are the possible values for an env variable so It can generate better types for it and recommend you a nicer example to use

add a comment at the end of the env line that includes "# variants:"


specify the different variants for your variable seperated by a "|" like you would in typscript


quotes are optional around the variants values




That's it.
Hope you've a great day, curios to see your feedback 🤗]]></summary>

Afterward, I start pondering... let's find out?
If you want to check it out: https://github.com/Noriller/js-console.log
I've made a repository and used jest to test if everything was working, I've also used this auxiliary function:
function Log() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}

Most were just variations of the same thing... but I did manage to make it work in some unexpected ways.
Because... why not?
Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log(); Log…]]></summary>

via GIPHY
In this article, I'll show you how to handle exceptions in Python.
An exception is an error that occurs while the program is running. In some cases, an exception may cause the program to stop or produce unexpected results. For example, taking a look at Fig 1.0. This program gets two numbers from the user and divides the first number by the second number, and displays the result. However, when the program is run, an exception occurs as shown in Fig 1.1.

Fig 1.1


The error message displayed in Fig 1.1 is called a traceback. A traceback provides information about the line number(s) that resulted in the exception. In Fig. 1.1,…]]></summary>

In this episode, we create a Post model class and move the post finding code from the route definition to the Mode class method find(). We add another method all() to this class where we fetch all posts from the resource/posts directory. We use the Laravel File Facades Illuminate\Support\Facades\File fetch all the files from a directory into an array.

Move post finding logic from route def to a Model class
Make the posts index page dynamic by getting file contents using the Laravel File Facades

No fear, this is not a tutorial. This is more of a strategic guide. Decision makers will continue reading. Apply these concepts to your project.
Opinion. After deploying countless websites, you will see the narrow difference between tech stacks. Python, PHP, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, and others all write HTTP responses. This uniformity means developers can pass all HTTP handling through a standardized web server interface like Apache/NGINX.
 
Web servers are a MUST and highly optimized for driving web traffic. Apache/NGINX fulfill common needs such as simultaneous requests, encryption, and "path rewriting" (sales). Businesses that do not use quintessential web servers are doomed to face early scaling issues.

We will show some demo code, but you'll need to fill in the blanks. 
First, you'll need a Stripe.com account. It's free to setup, and they give you two sets of API keys:
A test pair of public and private keys 
A live pair of public and private keys 
The test keys will make payments to your test account, and toggling between testing data and real payment data is as easy as clicking a toggle button in their dashboard.

For the first time in the cinematic history of Spider-Man, our friendly neighborhood hero's identity is revealed, bringing his Super Hero responsibilities into conflict with his normal life and putting those he cares about most at risk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近期，Mental Canvas 这款特殊的 iPad 绘画 App 凭借其独特的画作展示效果闯入了公众视野。

简单来说，这是一款拥有「3D 画布」的草图绘画工具，你可以将图层分别放置于立体空间中的不同位置，最后得以通过运动的「摄像机」来展示整个画作。

Mental Canvas 目前提供的功能数量不算多，本文将逐一详细介绍，作为简单的使用教程提供给各位参考。  
界面排布
Mental Canvas 除了画布界面外没有设置其他界面，在打开 App 时会立刻创建一个新项目。操作界面中的按钮排布和交互设计的逻辑与大多同类产品存在较大出入，说实话这让我在刚上手时有一点懵。
界面中设有「顶部工具栏」、左侧的「画布及图层列表」、底部的用于定位摄像机的「时间轴」，共三个板块。顶部工具栏从左至右可以分为「操作区」「绘制区」「定位区」和「模式切换开关」四个区域。（当然，这些都是我自拟的名字。）

绘制区
在顶部工具栏中的绘制区可以点选使用「画笔工具」「橡皮擦工具」「油漆桶工具」来进行作画。选中画笔工具后再次点击该按钮可以展开画笔设置界面，提供了更改画笔类型和调节画笔粗细的选项。

这三个按钮右侧有「调色盘」按钮，展开后可以进行取色或自定义颜色。

选取调整界面
位于绘制区最左侧的是「选取调整」按钮，选中后会在顶部工具栏置换为一系列新按钮，实质上是进入了选取调整界面。顶部工具栏左侧的区域为「选取区」，右侧为「调整区」。

选取区
选取区的按钮用于选取图层内的部分内容以便调整，其中提供了「按笔画选取」和「套索选取」两种选取方式，分别可以选择画面中一部分笔画或选择圈选的部分区域作为选区。其余的按钮分别为「向选区添加」「从选区减去」「取消选取」「反选」。
调整区
调整区包含几种对选区的调整操作，从左至右分别是用于修改选区部分颜色的「重上色」、清除选区内容的「删除」、启用后会使后几个调整改为对…]]></summary>

2021 年 11 月 12 日，宫崎英高又一次「跌入」神坛。这次倒也没别的，只是万代南梦宫于 2019 年 E3 游戏展上亮相的新作《艾尔登法环》终于开始了发售前的首次封闭网络测试。虽然仍在监修的游戏内容在封测中的表现依然需要打磨，但其优秀的总体质量和极高的媒体热度已然将玩家们对游戏跳票的不满冲刷殆尽，万代南梦宫甚至宣布该作的首发预期销量高达 400 万份，综合宫崎英高作品一贯的强口碑和高销量，这个数字似乎还显得保守了那么一点。
如今作为世界知名游戏发行商的万代南梦宫同时也是任天堂的最强游戏代工厂，其下属的工作室有半数以上为任天堂开发游戏。仅在 NS 平台，除去万代南梦宫自家发售的各类粉丝向冷饭之外，《马力欧赛车 8》这样的第一方大作有半数以上的内容由万代南梦宫参与制作，而《任天堂全明星大乱斗：特别版》这样的爆款游戏则是全盘交给万代南梦宫承包。众所周知，万代南梦宫在玩家群体中一直被归类为「任黑」，但这两家公司在游戏开发事务上的密切关系却形成了一种奇怪的 CP 感，不禁让人直呼「磕到了」。
相比起万代的小红标，这个 Logo 在游戏行业中更加为人熟知。
万代南梦宫由成立于 1950 年的万代和 1955 年的南梦宫合并而成，这两家公司是日本游戏产业的两大支柱，虽然侧重的领域有所不同，但它们都有过一个共同的合作伙伴和竞争对手：任天堂。与 1988 年就使用「替身攻击」欧拉任天堂的南梦宫不同，万代从一开始并没有那么勇。 FC 时代，作为任天堂授权厂商之一的万代自然也不满于任天堂不近人情的审查机制，与任天堂发生了一点小摩擦，不过二者之间…]]></summary>

indexOf()
Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, otherwise returns -1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I'll demonstrate a way to understand, analyse and reduce the time complexity on algorithms, specially on nested loops.
The examples will use Ruby but it can be translated to any programming language.
Working throughout a variety of projects, it's not rare to stumble on pieces of code like the following, a "nested loop", which is a loop under another loop:
for group in groups
  for user in users
    # do something with the group and user
  end
end

Analysing the above code, and assuming we have 100 groups and 100 users:
for each group (100 times) we iterate over all users (100 times), which leads 100 * 100 = 10000 iterations
each iteration has a cost to the CPU, so the more iterations we do, the more our algorithm will perform worse
if the lists grow over time, we can face seri…]]></summary>

Reasons to consider this resource-
The workflow is very well explained.
The code sample is available
Steps to test out provided.
Talking about the video resources:





This is a pretty short and concise video. 
It is from the official channel of Paypal.
This video very well explains the concept of different ways to integrate on any website.
Covers all the cases and is easy to follow up.
There is one more resource, that developers can follow up. I am not promoting their channel in any manner but I liked their flow and ease to follow.

I will not be getting into the benefits of applying on Client or Backend. That is up to the developer's choice of preference. If I had to recommend one, then I would have to say an easy way to implement would b the first one.
Getting on to the resource, this video takes care of most of the integration:




API integration I would say. I used this node module paypal-checkout
Installing it was very easy.
The npm page was

Set up your jobs to run in the docker, machine, macos or windows executor and specify an image with the tools and packages you need.

Also, CircleCI provide using so-called orbs with its platform. Orbs are open-source, shareable packages of parametrizable reusable configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. You may involve orbs to reduce configuration complexity and help you integrate …]]></summary>

I either end up over or under evaluating myself. This is due to who I think I am maybe completely different how other people actually perceive me to be.
I used a few different ways to identify my strengths and weaknesses. This consisted of:
Asking my peers and those around me: this helped me create a less self-serving bias list. I avoided asking people that I wasn’t too close with as they would give me vague and ‘nicer’ strengths and weaknesses. 
Taking an MBTI test: this helped me understand my personality better and how this can be reflected in my strengths and weaknesses

Learned how to code and design
Everything started in the last week of 2019
I was in my first year of high school and my uncle started talking to me about programming
He was already a senior web developer with over 10 years of experience
At that time I had already written a few lines of code at school in C++ but I had no idea what Web Development was
He told me that I should give this a try and told me to learn Python first

I had just written my first lines of JavaScript a couple months ago, and the knowledge gaps I had seemed infinite. It felt strange to call myself an Engineer when others who started with me clearly knew so much more than me. 
At first, I attributed these self-doubts and feelings of insecurity to my career change. After all, people's professions often form an important part of their identity, and mine had just changed completely. But over time, I realised that a lot of people around me felt the same, regardless of their background.

I Hate You

SZA

[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to makе me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just likе this?

[Verse 2]
Used to be too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是《秦时明月》的执行制片人薛小明。首先还是对各位喜欢《秦时明月》的秦迷朋友表示感谢。《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》十五周年版，已经播出第三集，相信大家都看到了一段精彩的打戏，不知道看得过瘾不过瘾。相信大家从中也能看出，我们在这个版本上花费的心血。

对于这部作品的意义，正如沈导之前回答提过，这次的十五周年版是在《秦时明月》播出十五周年之际，答谢秦迷和观众朋友的一份回馈。为了更好的效果，这次《新秦时明月》的制作也有很多不易，除了用我们最新的技术提升了画面的质感和各方面的细节之外，我们还进一步提高了打戏的观感。对一部武侠作品来说，打戏毫无疑问是至关重要的。而与注重特效的影视作品不同，《秦时明月》一直是那种“拳拳到肉”的写实武学实践者，相信看完第3集的观众就更能够感受到这种风格。

这一集的打戏占比是比较高的，从前面无双与项家子弟的切磋，中间少羽和无双单挑，到最后危急关头盖聂的一剑救场，可以说既还原了我们第一部的经典剧情，又增加了很多亮点。在武戏上，我们着重表现人物的特色以及更真实的打击感、紧迫感。为此，我们加快了打戏的节奏并尽可能的展现出角色见招拆招的设计，比如少羽和无双的这段打戏，无双的特点是力量强又有着钢筋铁骨，一旦被他抓住就很难脱身反击，所以少羽更多是依靠身法的灵活躲闪去进攻他的薄弱部位。且不管是无双还是少羽，所做出来的很多组合动作以及运镜都是经过不断地调整，同时是连续镜头，这样可以看出人物的连贯动作。

为了这些效果，我们的武戏部会与我们的动捕演员深入交流，所以武戏这方面，我们确实是花了很多力气去做。我想这也是秦时明月传统武学的魅力之一。
在正片的最后，大家可能注意到这是一段在旧版《秦时明月》中没有出现过的镜头，即盖聂找到天明并保护他的这段回忆。这段回忆是我们对剧情细节的一个补充，也是为了让盖聂这个角色更立体。相信通过这些细节的补充，可以让观众对盖聂为什么会叛离秦王宫的原因有了更多自己的理解。

这一集中主要涉及到的点就是以上这些，后续的剧集中还会有更多精彩丰富的内容呈现，希望大家能够多多支持我们。在此也感谢粉丝和观众为我们提出的建议，之后我们一定会继续努力，为大家带来更好的作品。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我从2006年进入游戏行业，长期从事开放世界游戏开发的美术及技术美术工作。对于游戏内容生产工具以及研发流程管线方面，我有着长期使用以及开发经验，直接参与过多个知名AAA游戏的研发，同时也支持其他研发团队的工作。来到天美技术中心后，我正在负责技术美术工具流程和技术方案的研发、推广落地以及技术支持。
近几年，开放世界游戏项目遍地开花，开放世界游戏的海量内容对数字内容设计和生产带来了两个大的挑战：一是内容制作量的大幅提升，二是内容品质提升，包括美术的高品质，丰富多样性、独特新颖性等要求。这两个挑战促使游戏从业者研究探索更多新的技术工具和工作流程来应对。
程序化生成是国内游戏制作方面的热门话题，还记得我曾参与制作一款海外大型开放世界游戏，当时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能比较简单，一个开放世界关卡美术可以制作和迭代一平方公里的关卡地图。
而两年后，我又参与了另一款开放世界游戏的制作，此时自然植被的程序化生成工具功能已经被迭代优化，一个关卡美术可以制作五平方公里的关卡地图。从中可以看出，先进的工具和流程，对提高数字内容生产效率的助力非常明显。
程序化生成通过在工具中设置一些程序化规则，去自动生成游戏内容，确实能在一定程度上提高制作效率。完善的工具和流程使得团队能够高效地制作出很多规模宏大且高品质的游戏内容，但是近些年，程序化生成工具和流程也逐渐显现出了一些限制和弊端。
首先，程序化生成的内容往往比较重复和单调。程序化生成通常由技术美术或者技术动画，通过观察归纳总结现实世界的现象效果，来制定生成规则，但是现实世界的丰富性和多样性会使得完全原样重现的规则过于复杂或者代价太高，所以在实际过程中，我们通常会简化规则，而简化规则以后，自动生成的效果就会丢失很多细节和变化。
举一个例子，在真实世界中，植被生长和分布的因素很多，例如降雨量、温度、湿度、经纬度、海拔、光照、风向、土壤环。而当我…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[回答此问题前，我们可以先看看，其他传统形式是呈现科幻题材的好载体么？
郭帆的影视团队对中国科幻的工业化影视改编做了拓荒性质的探索，团队选取了刘慈欣《流浪地球》这篇2.2万字中篇的其中一段进行了改编。从电影工业化来看，它的置景、服化道和特效真正做到了对叙事的辅助和增强（甚至还在半途成立了UI部门来解决呈现问题），他们的努力使得电影的世界可信、幻想合理，作为当代科幻电影可以说是合格了，但不少观众会批判其人物和剧情过于套路，而另一些观众则认为其格局过小、背离原著精神。
《爱，死亡与机器人》是以动画短篇形式对科幻呈现的探索，第一季18集中的16集背后都有科幻小说原著支撑，包括广受好评的《齐马蓝》。不少观众喜欢其恢弘浪漫的视觉表达和返璞归真的禅意，但原著中作者阿拉斯泰尔·雷诺兹还有一层探讨，是关于记忆的载体，由肉体记录的不稳定记忆和由机器记录的精确记忆，究竟哪一个才是人之为人的关键。有些科幻读者与学者惋惜于这部分探讨被完全抹去，但也有影评人认为这一取舍令此作品封神。
对于最近刚刚上映的《沙丘》意见分化更是严重，路人观众对于一群掌握空间旅行技术的人用冷兵器打群架十分困惑，认为其节奏缓慢、剧情拖沓。但也不乏喜欢其美术风格者，和包括我在内的对其精准还原了原著风貌与精神的科幻爱好者。
而最近火热的“元宇宙”概念，最早来自尼尔·史蒂文森的《雪崩》，这一科幻概念的落地已不再局限于单一载体，而是涵盖了多样载体与技术的现实社会。当然，有人认为这是人类发展的未来，也有人认为这个概念被过度解读，变成了什么都能装的口袋概念。
除此之外，《诗云》的广播剧、《三体》的舞台剧、《闭环》改编的剧本杀《星落五丈原》、综艺节目《火星情报局》等，都是对科幻题材落地形式的探索，但孰优孰劣，相信每一个欣赏体验过的人都有不同的看法。
 


对于游戏载体，这些问题也同样存在。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不知不觉在游戏开发行业已过十年，从刚入行的技术小白，到现在依然什么都不懂的技术搬砖工，见证了一个时代的游戏技术变革。我本人先后做过游戏开发SDK，端游MMO，休闲手游，重度手游，大世界手游，大世界端游等各品类产品，现在是天美F1工作室技术中台引擎程序团队负责人。
游戏行业发展很快，玩家对游戏的要求越来越高，游戏对技术的要求也越来越高，开发量也越来越大。我现在所在的天美F1工作室正在开发3A级全平台的大世界游戏，这是一件非常具有挑战的事情。
本人作为游戏引擎程序，深知技术更新之快，需要不断的学习才能接受这个挑战。所幸我们已经提前在多个方向积累了对标国际3A大厂的技术能力，并且还在全球招募了不少具有3A项目研发背景的各方面人才。通过不断的夯实技术基础，我们有能力也有信心接受新的挑战。在我们储备的技术中，PCG的技术是目前大世界游戏必不可少的一种技术，现在做一些简单介绍。
PCG（Procedural content generation过程化内容生成）技术是最近比较热的提升游戏生产效率的一类技术。它是什么意思呢？
网络百科给出的答案：过程生成（英语：procedural generation）是计算机科学中一种使计算机自动制造一类数据的算法。在计算机图形学中，它也被称为随机生成，常用于制作材质贴图和三维模型资源，并在电子游戏领域中用于自动制造大量游戏内容。过程化生成有着减小文件体积、扩大内容量、增强游戏随机性等优点。
我个人的理解：如果在游戏中应用，简单说，过程化内容生成就是利用算法来自动生成游戏内容。原有的游戏内容需要美术和策划花费大量的精力制作，过程化的方式可以大大降低人工成本，除了可以节省一些重复的人工劳动之外，甚至可以自动创作出一些新的设计内容。试想如果有一个程序可以自动生产游戏，那是多么有意思的一件事情，也许那天到来，游戏开发者都下岗了。
