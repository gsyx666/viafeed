Microsoft is working on a smaller and faster Outlook Lite app for Android. The software giant has detailed the app in its Microsoft 365 roadmap, where it describes Outlook Lite as “an Android app that brings the main benefits of Outlook in a smaller app size with fast performance for low-end devices on any network.”
The roadmap reveals that the Outlook Lite app will be available worldwide at some point this month. ZDNet reports that an Outlook Lite app already exists in a few countries, so Microsoft appears to be readying it for a broader release. Microsoft’s own documentation on Outlook Lite suggests the app will be limited to only Outlook, Hotmail, Live, and MSN accounts, and won’t support work or school accounts.

The semi-automated system consists of a sensor in the ball that relays its position on the field 500 times a second, and 12 tracking cameras mounted underneath the roof of stadiums, which use machine learning to track 29 points in players’ bodies. 
Software will combine this data to generate automated alerts when players commit offside offenses (that is: when they’re nearer to the other team’s goal than their second-last opponent and receiving the ball). Alerts will be sent to officials in a nearby control room, who will validate the decision and tell referees on the...

Amazon has agreed to simplify the process of canceling Prime in Europe, meaning customers in the region will be able to end their subscription in just two clicks, the European Commission has announced. The changes, which were implemented as of July 1st, should bring to an end the “multiple pages” filled with “distracting information” and “unclear button labels” that Amazon has previously used to add friction to the cancellation process.
The European Commission says the changes apply to the European Union and European Economic Area. Despite the UK having left the former as of the beginning of 2020, The Guardian reports that UK subscribers will also benefit from the two-click unsubscribe process. But when contacted for comment, a...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian Linux 9 结束了五年的长期支持

Debian 长期支持团队近日宣布：Debian Linux 9 系列的五年支持周期已经结束。Debian 9 发布于 2017 年 6 月 17 日，当时官方将该版本的 LTS 支持延长到了五年，以供有特定需要的人们使用。Debian Linux 10 是目前支持的旧稳定版本，还有两年维护支持，直到 2024 年 6 月 30 日。而最新的是 Debian Linux 11 。


消息来源：Debian



老王点评：一个纯由社区驱动的发行版都能支持 5 年，并被用在生产环境中，而很多商业公司支持的 Linux 发行版都不敢承诺。




传统数据安全工具大多无法抵御勒索软件攻击

根据最新发布的《数据渗透和勒索状况报告》，虽然超过 70% 的企业拥有一套现有的预防、检测和回溯解决方案，但近 40% 的企业在过去一年中仍然受到了勒索软件攻击。研究结果表明，传统的数据安全工具，如安全备份和恢复工具、提供静态和传输中加密的解决方案、标记化和数据屏蔽等，在 60% 的时间里未能保护企业的数据免受勒索软件威胁。它们的问题不在于它们没有强大的安全措施，而在于攻击者可以通过窃取凭证来实现对关键数据资产的特权访问，从而避开这些控制。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：可以预见，数据勒索这一攻击方式必然会愈演愈烈。




西数表示硬盘容量依然很重要

西数负责人在采访中谈到了对硬盘市场的看法，他也承认机械硬盘现在没有被出现在 MacBook、Windows 或者 Chromebook 等设备中，在客户端设备中存在感下降，但是放眼数据中心市场，情况就不一样了。在这个领域，闪存存储只占 5-15% 份额，剩余的 85%-95% 存储都是靠机械硬盘，还有一些是磁带设备。IDC 预测全球数据生产量从 2018 年的 33ZB 将增长到 2025 年的 176ZB，企业用户每年的数据容量增长将达到 30%。


消息来源：Next Platform



老王点评：确实，要说可靠性和大容量，还是机械硬盘比较好。但是感觉硬盘容量的增长赶不上数据量的增长速度。]]></summary>

Other teams prefer not to have any single strategy, but to allow each developer to come up with the easiest way to develop each feature independently, adapting the complexity of the solution to the complexity of the problem.

Keeping all of that infrastructure in the same CloudFormation stack can sometimes be troublesome however, and there are many reasons why you might consider having parts of it in a separate stack. A common approach is to keep stateful infrastructure, such as your DynamoDB tables or S3 buckets, in one stack, and stateless infrastructure, such as your Lambda functions or API gateways, in another. This way, you can more freely update or even tear down the stack that's naturally often changing while not risking affecting the long-living infrastructure that your application depends on.

我的网站，开启了 https ，现在情况是，百度抓取正常，各种测速网站打开正常，看流量统计也有访问，电脑手机连接我们单位 Wi-Fi 打开也正常（我们单位网络是联通光纤），联通电信 4G 打开正常，我找外地朋友用移动 4G 打开也正常，但就是我们单位附近的手机用移动 4G 网络打开，用浏览器打开提示您的连接不是专用连接，微信打开直接空白。
测试
我刚开始以为是 ssl 证书的问题，之前一直用的证书品牌是 R3 ，就换了 TrustAsia 证书，根证书，中间证书都是正常的，可是问题还是存在。
手机浏览器，微信都清除缓存，问题依旧。
发现了一个问题
我用移动 4G 打开网站，提示证书有问题的时候，我看了下问题证书，并没有显示我网站的证书，显示的居然是 咪咕文化的，咪咕就是移动旗下的。
求助
我也问了一些大佬，有人说，SSL 证书确实会出现 4G 网络下无效的问题。
也有人说 SSL 证书安装过程中，根证书链没有安装完整，此情况可能会造成有此提示，建议检查证书，但是我更换了证书，也测试了前后证书，评级都是 A+。
问题
大家有谁遇到过类似问题吗？有可能是什么原因造成的，我也是第一次遇到，网上搜索也没有结果，同服务器下的其他网站，系统，证书都是一样的，就不存在这个问题。]]></summary>

https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/
前几天装了最新的 Pycharm ，发现里面的 remote ssh 功能用的就是这个 gateway ，所以专门单独下下来试一下。
我的虚拟机上有 Java 和 Python 工程，分别安装了对应的远程 IDE ，发现有几点不爽：
启动速度太慢了，等转圈圈（开启远程项目，和 ssh 建立连接）起码 30 秒以上；
很卡，甚至代码高亮渲染都会延迟；
有一个 ping 值的实时显示不错，但是经常出现高 ping 的时候；
没感觉多轻量，机器负载很高，有些时候用 vs remote 就是可以把运算负担放在服务器上，自己的本子负载第一点，但是感觉 Gateway 并没有这样的优势；
vs remote 的终端感觉集成了类似 mosh 的 ssh 体验，可以消除一些延迟，jb 家的 remote 真的就 ssh 的原生体验（甚至更差一些）；
本身很喜欢 jb 家的 IDE ，但是又离不开 vs remote 和轻量化体验，鱼和熊掌不可兼得啊。]]></summary>

刚看到有人提到 Telegram 客户端为什么这么流畅引发的一点感想。我没记错的话，大概是 2013 年那会儿，豆瓣移动端的客户端是分开的，每一个业务都有单独的 App ，比如豆瓣小组是一个，豆瓣 FM 是一个，总共好像有十来个 App ，每一个都是很轻量。我还记得之前看过一篇采访，豆瓣创始人阿北说“不会有一个叫豆瓣的 App”。
然后到了大概是 2015 年还是什么时候，豆瓣用户用户活跃度降低，可能是市场原因，最终还是推出了大一统的豆瓣 App ，也就是现在大家在用的那个。
看得出来，豆瓣团队最初也是很推崇谷歌那种风格，或者说比较符合 Unix 哲学的方案，每个 App 只专注一件事，并做到最好。然而最终事与愿违，可能是水土不服吧，国内的 App 好像必须大而全，必须添加很多“佐料”
，这样才有市场，这也是为什么大多数国产 App 都特别臃肿。]]></summary>

笔记本 cpu 是 AMD Ryzen 7 3750H with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx ，在使用 RyzenAdj 对处理器功耗进行设置，参数入下
--tctl-temp=100 --fast-limit=35000 --slow-time=5 --slow-limit=28000 --stapm-time=120 --stapm-limit=23000 --min-socclk-frequency=1024 --max-gfxclk=1024

按我的理解，当 CPU 开始高负载时，首先进入 FAST PPT Limit 阶段，此时为 35W ，然后存留时间 Slow PPT Time ，也就是 5 秒后进入 SLOW PPT Limit 阶段，此时为 28W ，等再运行了 STAPM Time=120s 后，进入 Sustained Power Limit ，此时就等于 TDP 23W 了。
但是现在的情况不是很合我的预期。电脑空闲时基本能保持睿频在 3.1 GHz 左右，温度 90+，负载高了之后就只有 2.5-2.6 GHz ，温度接近 100 度，然后持续一段时间之后就过热降频，直接 0.5-0.6 GHz ，温度骤降至 60+。
难道不应该是空闲时间使用额定频率，高负载时使用睿频吗，还是我对 CPU 的睿频理解有问题，还请各位多多指教。]]></summary>

In this article, we will learn everything that we need to know about Big O notation and how you can use it to improve your ability to create efficient algorithms.
Big O notation is used to classify algorithms based on how fast they grow or decline. It is used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm as its input approaches infinity.
For Example:
Let's say we have a dentist and she takes 30 minutes to attend to one patient. As her line of patients increases, the time that it takes to treat all of the patients will scale linearly with the number of patients waiting in the line.

Big O(n)), where n is equal to the number of patients, the time that it take…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[magicblr: 
我妈原来用的是一个从镇上买的老人机，100 多元，牌子都没听说过的杂牌，用几个月以后，总发现话费不对，所以去查了一下具体清单，发现每个月都会莫名其妙的订购一些移动梦网业务，这个我原来也了解过，有些老人机里面有后台程序会自动订购，为了不再被偷话费，我把老妈的手机换成了一个智能机，神奇的事情发生了，我妈的手机几乎每天都会收到乱码的短信，发信人还不一致。这是收到短信的内容
$$xltj*aj*KQ5mRG5mSExESjcqK2JRNjhHYm43OF5INW9SHFtxSGJESjdJRnpJOyxEXG43OWBIOmBRNjdJX0RUD0pESRI4N0RcRGMmVEddSRIjQj5CPRp1PH4vPU5WMj88S2gjQlNeTGNySjcvPU4zHj95cWEmVERcRGMmVERcRGMmVERcRGMmVERcRGMmVERzQVhINjc0KwwkVg==$$

简单分析一下，$$是短信命令的起始标志，*号应该是具体命令的分隔符
xltj 应该是什么提交的拼音缩写，应该属于命令，aj 代表按键？
我把后面的内容 base64 解码了一下也是乱码，估计还有二次加密。内容应该是发短信订购某个移动梦网的业务吧。我把后面的内容 base64 解码了一下也是乱码，估计还有二次加密。内容应该是发短信订购某个移动梦网的业务吧。
我有两个事情想咨询一下，
如果知道这种命令的格式，有没有可能给老人机发送一条短信让它关闭这种远程控制的功能？
编写这个手机程序的人家里人死光了吗？没死光的话我去烧烧香给加加速。
我已经把我妈的手机换成智能机了，除了有这些垃圾短信烦一些至少不会再被偷话费了，真正用这种老人机的基本上都是收入并不高甚至没有收入又不懂怎么查话费的老爸老妈爷爷奶奶们，你们他妈的从这些老人手里偷这几块钱的话费是嫌自己爸妈出门被车撞的太轻死不痛快是吗！？我已经把我妈的手机换成智能机了，除了有这些垃圾短信烦一些至少不会再被偷话费了，真正用这种老人机的基本上都是收入并不高甚至没有收入又不懂怎么查话费的老爸老妈爷爷奶奶们，你们他妈的从这些老人手里偷这几块钱的话费是嫌自己爸妈出门被车撞的太轻死不痛快是吗！？
技术本身没有善恶，但人有，别把我只是写了代码作为借口，那些写这些代码的人、录制假药广告的人、推销保健品的人，请你们善良一点，共情一点、讲他妈一点人性！
我特别想创建一个这种公司、团队、个人的耻辱柱，让大家都看看都是什么垃圾公司垃圾人在干或者干过这些生孩子没屁眼的事！
https://github.com/pkfxbl/HallofShame
我创建了一个 github 库，或者由其他人创建一个库也可以，互联网总应该是有记忆的，我希望未来的某一天，当这个垃圾公司招聘、或者垃圾人应聘的时候让他们知道自己做过什么应该承担什么代价，我也希望有能力决定招聘或者决定合作方的团队能避开这样的公司或者个人。]]></summary>

虽然他们可能在努力增加更多的支持，比如 可以在 Linux 上安装微软 Edge 浏览器，但对于一个价值几万亿美元的公司来说，这并不出色。

同样，微软的 To-Do 服务也是一个受欢迎的服务，它取代了 2020 年关闭的 Wunderlist。

如果你不知道的话，我们有很多 可用于 Linux 的待办事项列表应用。因此，如果你想脱离微软 To-Do，你有选择。

微软 To-Do 是一个基于云的任务管理应用，让你从手机、桌面和网络组织你的任务。它可以在 Windows、Mac 和 Android 上下载。

那么，如果你不愿意使用网页浏览器而使用一个单独的应用，你在 Linux 上能做什么呢？

Kuro 派上用场了。

Kuro：非官方的开源微软 To-Do 应用



Kuro 是一个非官方的开源应用，它为你提供了微软 To-Do 在 Linux 上的桌面体验和一些额外的功能。

它是 Ao 的一个分叉，Ao 是一个开源项目，逐渐成为它的解决方案。不幸的是，它不再积极维护了。所以，我遇到了一个似乎可以工作的新复刻。



Kuro 提供了一些额外的功能，可以让你在应用中切换主题，启用全局快捷方式等。

请注意，这个应用是相当新的，但有一个稳定版本可以试用。此外，开发者计划在不久的将来增加更多的主题和功能。

Kuro 的功能



如果你倾向于使用微软的服务（如 Outlook），它的 To-Do 应用应该是组织你的任务的一个完美选择。你甚至可以标记电子邮件以创建任务。

使用 Kuro 桌面客户端，你可以得到一些可配置的功能，包括：


能够在启动时启动该程序。

获得一个系统托盘图标，以快速创建一个任务，搜索，或检查当天的可用列表。

启用全局快捷键。

切换可用的主题（深褐色、德古拉、黑色、深色）。

切换自动夜间模式，如果你不想不断改变主题。

隐藏托盘图标，如果你不需要它。

根据需要定制字体大小。




除了一些功能外，你还可以进入某些设置来启用/禁用电子邮件通知、删除前确认等，对待办事项应用体验的进行更多的控制。

总的来说，体验并不糟糕，但我在几分钟内注意到用户界面上有一些奇怪的图形问题。我不确定这是否是一个已知的问题。

在 Linux 中安装 Kuro

你可以从它的 GitHub 发布页面 找到基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的 .deb 包。

此外，你可以从 Snap 商店 中在你选择的任何 Linux 发行版上安装它。该软件包也可在 Arch Linux 发行版的 AUR 中获取。

开发者还提到，正在开发一个 Flatpak 软件包。所以，你可以关注它的 GitHub 页面以了解更多相关信息。


Kuro


你已经试过它了吗？你知道有什么更好的微软 To-Do 客户端用于 Linux 吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。

If you find navigating your Git repositories frustratingly complex, have I got the tool for you. Meet Tig.
Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for Git that allows you to browse changes in a Git repository. It also acts as a pager for the output of various Git commands. I use this tool to give me a good idea of what’s been changed in which commit by whom, the latest commit merged, and so much more. Try it for yourself, starting with this brief tutorial.
Installing Tig
On Linux, you can install Tig using your package manager. For instance, on Fedora and Mageia:
$ sudo dnf install tig
On Debian, Linux Mint, Elementary, Pop_OS, and other D…]]></summary>

如题
需求是偶尔测试 mac 程序，由于只是偶尔使用，性能要求不高，一般即可。
但是对于 windows 性能要求挺高，为了方便测试，有时需要跑多个虚拟机模拟整个服务环境。
目前的设备是：
台式机，32G 内存，2T SSD 。
笔记本，32G 内存，2T SSD 。
Mac mini ，8G 内存，500G SSD 。
麻烦是
远程到 mac mini ，由于有些测试操作涉及到网络，远程如果断开那么就无法再次连入了。
笔记本用 vmware 开 mac 虚拟机，非常卡顿，鼠标移动都会卡。
有些想买台 mac m1 或 m2 的笔记本，正好也能测试下 m1 下工作是否正常。
但 m1/2 的 cpu 无法跑 windows ，那么必须同时携带两个笔记本，感觉有些麻烦。
现在很纠结，是否有什么方案可以使得虚拟的 mac 跑得比较流畅些？
另外，mac 测试环境怎么搭建？是否有方案可以像 vmware 开 windows 测试虚拟机一样，破坏性测试完直接回滚快照就能恢复原始状态？
实在不行可能只能考虑再买个低配 m1 ，主力用 windows 本，mac 只负责 mac 下相关测试...]]></summary>

金融数字化步履不停，研发效能升级不止
秉“双区”建设之势，怀服务大湾区之志，深圳某大型银行（以下简称“A 银行”）在 2022 年全面开启以数字化转型为方向的第二个五年发展战略规划新征程。“零售+科技+生态”动力齐驱，A 银行坚持以科技敏捷带动业务敏捷，不断纵深推进数字化转型与场景经营。
然而，随着 A 银行数字化转型逐渐深入，快速扩张的 IT 建设团队给多团队管理及跨团队协作带来了全新的挑战，而不断变化的业务需求，也对研发资产的安全管控及研发交付的效率、质量提出了更高的要求。
为了让 IT 建设团队以更敏捷的协作、更高效高质的交付应对数字时代的业务需求，A 银行最终从多家厂商中选择引入 CODING 一站式研效平台，从研发效能升级入手加快其数字化步伐。
CODING 灾备异构方案，保障银行业务连续性
对于金融行业来说，保障用户数据安全以及业务连续性是重中之重。为此，A 银行内部有严格的数据容灾要求：硬件层面满足一份数据三个副本存储，任意一物理节点宕机均不影响平台正常运行使用，同时还要满足不同平台的异构备份。
为了帮助 A 银行完成基础设施升级，实现其灾备要求，CODING 的专家团队深入客户现场，最终制定了以 CODING 为基座的容灾及异构备份建设方案。在应用层面上，采用罗湖（主）-武汉（备）两地每日定时同步增量数据，两地 K8S 集群主节点挂载独立备份存储实现连续 7 日平台全量数据备份。同时，行内原有 GitLab 通过 CODING 持续集成流水线，自动实现定时触发备份，达到异构诉求；备份结果每日推送上报 IM 通信平台，管理人员及时感知。

CODING 为 A 银行制定的容灾及异构备份建设方案
在为 A 银行制定灾备方案的过程中，如果选择实时同步，会存在以下两个尖锐问题：
实时同步会导致频繁读写，网络稳定性、平台稳定性难保障，且数据库…]]></summary>

另外，最近想出门拍拍 VLOG ，刚刚 618 时忍痛入手了一台索尼 A7S3 ，拍视频是不错，但是加上镜头，平时带着还是不太方便，太笨重了。原本想买运动相机，但是怕夜景画质不好。
但是这次，我看 Xiaomi 12S 摄像头看着漂亮，是跟徕卡合作，徕卡不比索尼差吧？不知道拍视频跟 A7S3 差距有多大。这次本来是想用 Xiaomi 12S 代替 索尼 A7S3 。
我现在挺纠结的，家人们可以说说它的优缺点吗？你们会买吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文列出了 2022 年可以用于不同情况的 10 个 Ubuntu 基本应用。


不管你是偶尔使用的用户、学生、老师，还是科学家、开发人员和创意工作者，在工作上你需要各种各样的应用程序。Linux 生态系统有数以千计的应用程序，它们分散在各个角落，几乎可以满足各种需求。而包括 Ubuntu 在内的大多数主流 Linux 发行版，默认都只提供了基本的应用程序。

在这个五篇系列文章的第一篇中，我们列出了一些每个人都用的上的专门应用。

1、GNOME 优化工具

如果你在使用 Ubuntu GNOME 版，GNOME 优化工具GNOME Tweak Tool是你必备的实用工具。使用这个工具来定制你的桌面，你可以改变字体、缩放比例、主题、光标和许多其他选项。默认的设置窗口现在没有列出所有这些选项。

此外，你也能用该应用改变窗口装饰、标题栏、标题栏按钮以及开机启动项。

你可以使用应用商店搜索 “Tweaks” 来安装它，或者通过下列终端的命令来安装：

sudo apt install gnome-tweaks




2、Steam

由于 Valve 公司和相关社区的贡献，在 Linux 上玩游戏不再困难。Steam 是 Valve 公司开发的电子游戏服务的前端平台，你可以通过 Steam 在 Ubuntu 上获取最新的游戏版本。此外，Steam 客户端提供反外挂监测、自动更新，和支持带有流媒体功能的社交对话。

如果你是一个 Linux 游戏玩家，Steam 是常用的客户端，你可以用下面的命令来安装。此外，你可以在应用商店中搜索 “Steam Installer” 并使用 Flatpak 或 Snap 进行安装。

sudo apt install steam




3、Peek

在我看来，Peek 是一款被低估的应用。它是一个…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[矿卡最近大量出货外加价格跳水，没独显用的DIY电脑玩家也蠢蠢欲动，有些胆子大的群友们已经安全下车。

 
为了给有想法下山的朋友避坑，本文和大家总结分享一下矿卡相关基础知识及简单翻新操作，觉得有用欢迎关注、点赞、收藏三连哈。

 
⏹ 本文目录
本人不卖矿卡，由于矿卡的特殊性也不会给大家推荐店铺，别问我在哪儿买，谢谢理解。

 
⏹ 购买前丨必须了解这些再下手
先回答下大家比较关心的问题，请看完这段再决定买不买。
1️⃣ 矿卡到底能不能上？
如果手头比较紧，上矿卡肯定是性价比比较高的选择，毕竟刚开始批量出货的到手品质肯定比较好，等大货出的差不多了残次品占比也会高点，参考当年的星际蜗牛。

 
当然，买矿卡就是买闷包，到手到底咋样谁说了都不算（包括个人矿），点亮肯定能点亮，不过满载之后的稳定性就不好说了，撞温度墙降频基本跑不掉，比如我自己收的3060 12G就这毛病。

 
一般来说拆机清灰换个硅脂能解决上面说的温度问题，但是也有可能是烧过显存或者GPU核心的返修卡，所以说建议脸黑的朋友就不要考虑上车矿卡。

 
2️⃣ 需要准备多少预算？
矿卡出货目前主要有四个梯队，价格差距不看卡的状态，只看是不是一二线品牌：

300~400元价位的A卡RX580 8g
800~900元价位的N卡GTX1660s 6G和GTX1080 10G
1600-2000元价位的N卡GTX3060 12G/GTX3060ti 8G和A卡6700XT 12G
2000~2200元的N卡GTX3070 8G

 
另外还有最近和都市怪谈一样的BYD代工EVGA 3070/3070Ti，某鱼到处都是求收购，没见过有谁真拿到手，BYD官网也出来辟谣了，感觉JS炒货可能大一些。

 
3️⃣ 去哪儿买比较靠谱？
只能某鱼或者某转了，确实也有低于常规价格10-15%的低价卡，一般是走大货10张起拿，个人用户不…]]></summary>

YouTube, Instagram, Discord, and Twitter moved quickly to pull social media pages that appeared to belong to Robert Crimo III, a person of interest in the Chicago suburb shooting that left six dead and dozens injured this afternoon. Under a pair of aliases, Crimo seems to have posted more than a dozen videos to YouTube and hosted a Discord channel named “SS,” which was open to the public through an invite link.
Crimo’s apparent YouTube account hadn’t posted in around eight months, based on The Verge’s viewing before the account was pulled. The most recent video included concerning language and imagery that appeared to involve classrooms and stick-art depictions of people being shot. Another clip seemed to be a music video for a rap song,...

They might often be an afterthought nowadays, but in the console generations of yesteryear, game manuals were often essential reading. Compared to the scant pack-ins that come with games today, those vintage instruction manuals were on a completely different level in terms of the care and detail that went into them — and the page count was much higher, too.
Now, as noted by Kotaku, a community project led by led by streamer Peebs has successfully scanned and uploaded every last English-language game manual for the Super Nintendo. You can check out the entire collection here. Peebs was motivated to assemble one central resource for manuals during an eight-year quest to play and beat every SNES game for his Twitch viewers.

It just got way easier and more convenient to remotely watch Amazon Prime Video’s TV shows and movies together with your friends. The service’s “Watch Party” feature has received a much needed expansion from the limited use cases where it worked before — on Fire TV devices, desktop web browsers, and the Prime Video mobile app — and it now supports non-Amazon streaming devices, smart TVs, and Xbox / PlayStation gaming consoles. TechCrunch first reported on the expansion. 
Watch Party allows for up to 100 people with a Prime subscription to view content at the same time. The host is able to play, pause, skip, and fast forward or rewind for the group, and everyone can chat about what they’re watching. 
For now, Amazon’s Watch Party feature...

Minecraft has been updated with a tribute to the popular streamer Technoblade, whose death from cancer was announced by his family last week. The splash image for Minecraft in the game’s launcher now features a pig wearing a golden crown — a callout to Technoblade’s Minecraft character, a royal pig-man wearing a bejeweled crown.
The Minecraft team tweeted on Friday that the team was ”heartbroken over the loss of Technoblade,” writing that he “brought so much joy” to the game’s community.
We have been trying to find the words, but all of us here at Minecraft are heartbroken over the loss of Technoblade. He meant so much to our community and brought so much joy. He will be missed dearly.    ️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has launched its first “micromobility hub” in the UK with the aim to swap “thousands” of polluting delivery trucks with electric cargo bikes — and, in some cases, walking. The project is intended to help Amazon achieve its climate goals to have 50 percent of its deliveries be carbon neutral by 2030. 
Starting in the London borough of Hackney, the company says that it will deliver 1 million packages a year using walking and electric cargo bikes, in addition to deliveries that are made with electric vans. Delivery workers on foot and e-bikes will help displace “thousands” of traditional van trips, Amazon said.

Crosby, Stills & Nash are back on Spotify, five months after the supergroup abandoned the platform in protest of Joe Rogan’s spread of COVID misinformation. The group will donate streaming profits to COVID-19 charities for “at least a month,” according to Billboard.
The musicians’ return to Spotify marks a quiet and relatively unglamorous end to their protest, which has largely had the effect of boosting Rogan’s subscriber numbers, if the podcaster is to be believed. Crosby, Stills & Nash originally announced back in February that they would pull their music in solidarity with sometimes-bandmate Neil Young, who kicked off a series of artist protests of Spotify when he removed his music and published an open letter criticizing the company...

Xiaomi is introducing a trio of new smartphones today, and one of them comes with a pretty huge new feature: a 1-inch camera sensor, which is relatively giant for a smartphone.
Everything about Xiaomi’s new flagship smartphone, the Mi 12S Ultra, is big. It has a 6.73-inch OLED display, a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 system on a chip, and a camera-lens shaped bulge on that back that takes up about a third of the phone’s rear side.
Inside that faux-lens are the phone’s three cameras: a 48 megapixel ultrawide, a 48 megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom (and “120x” digital zoom that will probably not look very good), and finally, the 50 megapixel main camera, which uses that 1-inch sensor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下一代 GTK 5 可能要放弃 X11 支持

GTK 4 才推出没多久，而下一代的 GTK 5 可能还要很多年，但 GNOME 开发者们已经开始考虑在 GTK 5 剔除对 X11 的后端支持。有开发者认为，X11 迟迟没有变得更好，其开发几乎陷入停顿。而与此同时，Wayland 却已经变得广泛使用，GTK 也早已开始转向以 Wayland 功能为主的 API 设计。当然，开发者的这些讨论仅针对 GTK5，而不影响 GTK4 的更新。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：X11 是 1987 年发布的 X 窗口系统的第 11 个版本，但是目前的参考实现是 10 年前推出的 7.7 版本。它的历史包袱太沉重了，趁早放弃，并让应用都迁移到 Wayland 才是正路。




大学拿回了支付的比特币赎金，发现还赚了

2019 年荷兰一所大学遭到勒索软件攻击，由于备份系统也被锁定了，大学最后同意支付价值 20 万欧元的比特币赎金。荷兰警方在随后的犯罪调查中跟踪到了一个洗钱账号，其中有大约价值 4 万欧元的部分比特币赎金，并在两年后将这些比特币归还给了大学。有趣的是，这些比特币现在已价值 50 万欧元。虽然没有拿回全部的赎金，但归还的比特币价值相比支付的赎金已经翻了一倍多。该大学表示这笔钱将用于帮助经济拮据的学生。


消息来源：DW



老王点评：这算不算是来自勒索攻击者的“被动投资”，就像门头沟事件后，很多人假如即便只能拿回当时的一小部分 BTC 也赚了很多。




Meta 将关闭加密货币项目

Meta（Facebook）的加密货币 Diem（前称 Libra）将于 9 月 1 日停止运作。Facebook 及其盟友是在 2019 年宣布了稳定币项目 Libra，计划在 2020 年推出。但该项目面临了世界各地监管机构的压力，主要盟友陆续退出。负责该加密货币计划的高管在 2021 年离开了公司，相关资产被出售，而 Meta 的兴趣也转向了元宇宙。


消息来源：CNET



老王点评：曾经被视为革命性的 Facebook 加密货币项目，终于走到了终点。有时候你得承认，步子太大也是危险。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be honest with ourselves, at some point in our lives we wanted our own Jarvis. There’s something incredibly awesome about having a personal voice assistant to be able to give us information, manage our schedules, and just help us out with our day to day lives.
In this article, we’ll build a foundation with python that you can use to build your own personal voice assistant.
The foundation of our program will be a speech recognition library and a Text to speech library(TTS) which will allow us to communicate with our script purely through audio.
The script will run on a loop of:
Waiting for a command from the user
Understanding and fulfilling a command
We’ll add some basic examples to do some small talk, tell the time, open apps and a few other things. This foundation can very easily be augmented to add whatever functionality you might want from your assistant. If you can do it in python, you can make the bot do it.
In a new python project, first install the speech recognition library with:
pip install SpeechRecognition
And install the TTS library with:
pip install pyttsx3
In a python file, we’re then going to:
Load in our imports
Configure the text to speech
Define our speech function
The bot above can fulfill the following commands:
Tell the time
Give a random number
Open and Close Slack
Whatever tasks you want your assistant to complete, you can now simply add another conditional to the list!
Of course, you can add a lot more complexity:
Power the assistant w/ Conversational AI via Rasa

Play music with the Spotify API
Pull information from wikipedia via Web Scraping



That’s all for today!
Got any questions? Let us know down below.
As always, happy coding from your friends at Codesphere, the swiss army knife that every development team needs!]]></summary>

日常用 niz 87 84 很满意，有 3 把 2 把 87 泡水有线，1 把 84 无线
之前萌生出床上用电脑的想法，又不想买个小桌子放床上。就搜到这种分体键盘。
无品牌，淘宝买的，轴体是 TTC 静音红 v3 ，相比 niz 在静音方面差不多，但是感觉还是手感偏重了。已知问题：
nuc 是放在电视架和电视之间的缝隙里的，因此无线接受器和床上的键盘隔着 3 米左右距离，还被电视档了一道，这个。这个通过一根延长线把接收器延申到电视下解决了。 
因为信号原因，右半的信号好点，左半的差点，导致输入快的时候，明明是先打左半的字母再打右半的字母，结果反而是右半的字母先上屏（这个真的很难想到有这种坑，比如打 wo ，上屏会变成 ow ），但也由于问题 1 的解决而解决了。
因为这个空格键帽很奇葩（ 2.25U ），空格键帽是凸起的，老板送的 2 个空格键帽是凹进去的，大拇指按着会割手。于是又学了很多键帽知识，有原厂、OEM 、XDA 、MDA 等一堆高度，然后选了 MDA 的一套键帽（极简白）+分体空格单买的 XDA 键帽（没有便宜的 MDA2.25 凸起的空格单卖，只有几百块的套装里有一颗不单卖，实在买不起）。
老板问要不要自己买更好的卫星轴给它装，于是买错了买成了钢板卫星轴的腹灵 v3 ，但要 PCB 螺丝卫星轴，因此耽搁了 1 周时间。但这个 PCB 螺丝卫星轴，又和上面买的 MDA 、XDA 键帽有冲突，到手了用老板提供的 2 个空格键（也只提供了这 2 个键帽）会卡键。解决方法是用螺丝刀把键帽的孔暴力撑大，然后就不会卡了。
键盘高度比一般的更高一些（有可能是因为我原的这个亚克力套件的原因？），因为我这个一般不用手托的人用着也有点不觉得不方便。
轴体也是自己买寄过去给老板焊接的，因为非常喜欢 niz 的手感和静音性，但又买不到 niz 的轴体，就选了这个 42g TTC 静音红，手感对比下来还是更喜欢 niz 35g 。他家还有金粉轴 37g 但不静音，冰静轴 39g 但很多人要润不然容易卡键（这又是更深层次的领域了不想碰）。  
鼠标是罗技 m575 ，轨迹球，非常适合这种场景，目前有 2 个。但有一定的操作门槛（我同事试了下就说不适应）]]></summary>

五月初在 upwork 上有个工作推送给我, 老板是德国人, 要做一个项目, 进行了一次电话交流, 最后签了合同, 合同上写 7 月 30 号之前要做一个 app 出来, 当时老板的想法是做一个喝水 app, 提醒喝水, 再加上硬件 BLE 控制的智能水杯(BLE 这块不是我负责). 项目是用 ReactNative 来做, 后台用的 Firebase, 很少有接口, 前端直接操作 Firestore(读写 db), 项目团队初期是有一个后台, 一个负责硬件 BLE 的, 一个 UI, 还有俩负责前端(iOS+Android).
前端另一个哥们 RN 写的不多, 写了一点功能, 然后就离开了项目. 前端项目基本都是我做的, 包括搭建整个项目, 集成各种第三方库, 打包分发(包括 codepush), 还有 90%以上的页面.
介绍下我吧. 我想找一个兼职, 每周干 20 小时, 赚点外快, 我写过几个 RN 项目, 可以说有个 2 年的 RN 开发经验(从我的 github 上可以看出来), 和老板签的合同是 $20/hours.
经过几次开会, wireframe(原型图) 变得越来越复杂, 不仅仅是一个喝水类 app, 变成了养宠物为主要功能, 喝水 /咖啡 /维他命用来喂养宠物, 进行一些挑战(喝水 /步数挑战等)可以解锁新宠物, 有商店, 可以花钱买宠物(in app purchase), 买各种宠物的配件(墨镜 /鞋子 /帽子), 当然提醒喝水的功能也是有的. 宠物在首页是动画的, 我推荐用 LottieView, 用起来也没有任何问题. 当然开会也说过要加 NFT 和 AI 识别喝的什么饮料. 然后被我们 pass 掉了.
项目管理用的 Monday, 交流用 slack, UI 用的 Figma, 每周至少一次视频会议, 最近几次都是晚上九…]]></summary>

如题，SwiftUI 4 虽然已经很完善了，Grid 布局、ViewThatFits 、AnyLayout 都非常香，但一方面它面向 iOS 16 ，另一方面 UIKit 依然，而且可能永远是绕不过的坎。
但是我简单搜了一下，关于 UIKit 的教程，基本上都是很古老的了。
倒是有个 https://designcode.io/uikit-ios15 不错，但是它是基于 Storyboard 的。
我比较希望有一个纯代码布局的 UIKit 教程，中英文无所谓，视频的话希望比较简洁高质量，参考上面那个。
不要 Objective-C 的教程，主要是因为它确实是上古语言，平日里看得懂就足够了。]]></summary>

对于 Go 一直在关注和了解，写过几个玩具项目，实际工作中没有使用过。现在有几个公司内部项目需要启动，想组建一个 Go 团队，刷选了几轮简历发现应届生或者毕业一两年的，简历上面 Go 的身影越来越多。
倒不是排斥 Java ，说实话写 Java 心智负担较重，看过很多 Java 写的项目代码是惨不忍睹，导致现在看到 Java 就有一种「恶心」的感觉，其实也明白 Java 确实比较适合写业务，但是我觉得写好并不容易，尤其是对一些刚毕业开发经验少的同学来说。
另外我十分赞同 Rob Pike 的这段话：
"The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt."
这也是我想全面转用 Go 语言的原因
有其他语言背景可以快速上手
简单高效，心智负担小（没有面向对象、继承）
开源社区有大量的库辅助开发
1.18 终于上了泛型
大爱 gofmt ，if err != nil (doge
因为是公司内部业务系统，没必要上微服务，且前端打算使用 Vue 2|3 ，想请教大家两个问题：
后端如何选型？
如何分层，项目结构如何布局？]]></summary>

With the rgb function, the arguments are used to produce color

Each argument, red/green/blue, can range from 0 to 255. O means there is 0% of that color and 255 means there is 100% of that color.
For example: We'll use 3 div elements to demonstrate the use of the rgb model

现在项目 A 直接导入项目 B 打包出来的dist文件
// projectA/src/main.ts

import '../projectB/dist/style.css'

因此项目中就有了两个版本的'Element-plus'样式。 导致输入框有两个边框。
那么针对这种两个项目使用不同版本组件库的问题，怎么做隔离？

JavaScript generators first appeared in the ES6(ECMAScript2015) version of the JavaScript language.
A generator, in its most basic definition, is a process that can yield multiple different values and can be paused and resumed again. In JavaScript, a generator is made up of a generator function that produces an iterable Generator object. In addition, generators are able to handle unlimited data streams and can maintain state, which makes it possible to create iterators efficiently. Additionally, when used in conjunction with promises, generators can replicate the async/await capabilities,…]]></summary>

Small animals like canaries were useful to detect 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒔𝒐𝒏 because of their rapid breathing rate and high metabolism. When the birds began to collapse, the miners knew that 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒔𝒐𝒏𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝒈𝒂𝒔 was nearby and that the area was dangerous.
If this practice ended 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟖𝟕 as new detection technology was developed, the concept has been resurrected in the DevOps context... but without canaries! 🐣
In the context of 𝘿𝙚𝙫𝙊𝙥𝙨, Canary Releasing is the act of deploying a new release to a small group of users, before releasing it to all. This method reduces the risk of problems in the new release.
It's a way to test your software without blocking the delivery process, even with slow life cycles. 🔄
Canaries are no longer used as test subjects, but the expression persists in time in new areas...

折腾了两个月。现在 1.1 版本各方面基本达到我的预期。用户引导完全没有做上手可能有些难😭。7 月 9 日前均为免费，打算定价 18 买断（订阅势必会造成功能撕裂）。如果你觉得好用，务必帮我好评留言🙏
核心逻辑：
输入支出金额 + 点选最多 6 个预设的标签 -> 完成记账
特色功能：
-总预算：预设总预算后，自动计算单日预算，并且根据记录的支出自动计算剩余单日预算
-标签组合：预设特定的标签组合，可以查看对应的支出总和笔数，也可以设置组合的预算，与总预算不相关。

ps: 
最近在准备托福，比较习惯边写边记忆，就做了一个背单词的 app 。
通过 csv 导入单词，可以搭配 pencil 一起边写画边背单词。
目前只支持 ipad+pencil 。
有同样需求的可以试试。目前也是免费。

背景：
奶奶在农村，年纪大了，希望给她弄个 WIFI ，可以视频，然后装个监控看下老人。
位置比较偏僻，不给拉网线。
给买了个智能机，用网络数据有时候有信号，不是很好，另外老人怕花钱，不愿意用流量。
求问，目前市面上的无线 WIFI ，插电即用的那种，有没有啥牌子的比较靠谱，价格也适中的。
我的理解，这种就是一张流量卡，信号质量是不是还和运营商相关。]]></summary>

The most basic way to look at your files and folders is to use the commands ls and ll. But sometimes, I want to see not just the file metadata but also the contents of a file at a glance. For that, I use ranger.
If you love working out of your console and using Vim or Vi, and you don’t want to leave your terminal for any reason, ranger is your new best friend. Ranger is a minimal file manager that allows you not only to navigate through the files but also to preview them. Ranger comes bundled with rifle, a file executor that can efficiently choose programs that work with a given file type.

Ranger can be installed in Fedora …]]></summary>

Matrix  是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。 
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

诚然有些标题党了，因为在拍照的时候通常只有两个状态：下意识的按下快门和琢磨如何调整拍摄角度以达到最好的拍摄效果。遇到需要正经拍摄或者抓拍时再思考，那大概率是来不及了。
但如何达成随手一拍就是自己想要的照片构图和视角，这确实是需要不断思考的。最近梳理了一些照片和拍摄随笔，自娱自乐的同时也想抛砖引玉，和大家一起聊聊关于摄影这件事的个人理念和拍摄思路。

2016 年机缘巧合开始使用被笑称为 1％ 的 Nokia Lumia ，第一次体验到了蔡司（手机）镜头的锐度和 Lumia 相机的高可玩度。从此走上了 手机 -> 黑卡 -> 微单 -> 单反 -> 手机 的摄影爱好不归路。当我真正意识到我喜欢摄影这件事时，恰恰是我以 Lumia 928 和 iPhone 5s 这两部手机为主，完成了我人生的第一个 365 作品：即连续 365 天每天拍摄一张照片发到朋友圈。由此学习到了基础的拍摄概念，并慢慢找到了自己的拍摄风格。
后期软件上也历经学习电脑端的 PS，LR 和手机端的 Camera 360，泼辣，Vscam。现在使用频率最高，也是最为顺手的则是谷歌出品的修图软件 Snapseed。
拍照一时爽，修图到天亮
在过去的数年间，智能手机摄像头的快速发展，让我这样的普通人可以以较低的门槛来享受捕捉美图的快乐，而无需购买昂贵的单反设备，因此带来了摄影领域的一片欣欣向荣。一键修图等美颜或滤镜类的软件则带来了全民出图的高潮和审美的疲劳。
那我是如何看待拍照这件事的呢？且听我慢慢道来。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[找不到合适的配图，一直以来是我对写作心存畏惧的原因之一。正所谓「一图胜千言」，很多时候写好了的文字，总差一张恰到好处的配图画龙点睛。
另一方面，中文环境下比文字版权状况更糟糕的，可能就是图片版权了。不少新媒体 / 自媒体不能恰当地引用图片并标注来源，其实累积了不小的法律风险1。
所幸少数派的大部分作者专注于软硬件分享，可以或截图、或自拍、或借用官方商业图片（毕竟通常是正面宣传，没有太大的风险），从而规避了上述问题2。
所以今天分享的内容，可能只适用于少数派了吧 : )
什么是 DALL · E？
2021年1月，致力于「用通用人工智能造福全人类」的 OpenAI 公司基于其 GPT-3 模型发布了划时代的 DALL·E，实现了从文本生成图像。
来自 DALL·E 论文的 Figure 3，第一行图片是正对照，第二行图片是由 DALL·E 基于每列标题自动生成的图片，剩余三行奇奇怪怪的图片由其他对比算法生成。
DALL·E 的弱鸡版（mini）去年 4 月公开，完全版（mega）一直拖到今年 5 月，DALL·E 2 都正式发布了3，才趁大家都在排队时偷偷放出。
所以我们在指南中建议如下策略，并在后文提供每个策略的具体步骤：

只是想测试看看效果，可以直接使用 Hugging Face 上的 dalle-mini；
需要程序化频繁调用，可以考虑在 Google Colab 部署一份私有的 mini；
追求更好的生成效果，有条件的同学可以尝试一下 mega。

直接使用 mini 版

访问 dalle-mini 模型在 Hugging Face 上的页面；
在文本输入框填入语句，点击 Run 运行；
等待 20-60s 就能看到结果了，就这么简单！
为了方便对比效果，我们统一使用官方案例「an armchair in the shape of an avocado（牛油果形状…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[代码生成器是非常有用的工具。我有时使用 jinja2 的命令行版本来生成高度冗余的配置文件和其他文本文件，但它在转换数据方面功能有限。显然，Jinja2 的作者有不同的想法，而我想要类似于 列表推导list comprehensions 或 D 语言的 可组合范围composable range 算法之类的东西。

我决定制作一个类似于 Jinja2 的工具，但让我可以通过使用范围算法转换数据来生成复杂的文件。这个想法非常简单：一个直接用 D 语言代码重写的模板语言。因为它 就是 D 语言，它可以支持 D 语言所能做的一切。我想要一个独立的代码生成器，但是由于 D 语言的 mixin 特性，同样的模板语言可以作为嵌入式模板语言工作（例如，Web 应用程序中的 HTML）。有关该技巧的更多信息，请参阅 这篇 关于在编译时使用 mixins 将 Brainfuck 转换为 D 和机器代码的文章。

像往常一样，源码在 GitLab 上。这篇文章中的例子也可以在这里找到。

Hello world 示例

这是一个演示这个想法的例子：

Hello [= retro("dlrow") ]!
[: enum one = 1; :]
1 + 1 = [= one + one ]


[= some_expression ] 类似于 Jinja2 中的 {{ some_expression }}，它在输出中呈现一个值。[: some_statement; :] 类似于 {% some_statement %} ，用于执行完整的代码语句。我更改了语法，因为 D 也大量使用花括号，并且将两者混合使模板难以阅读（还有一些特殊的非 D 指令，比如 include，它们被包裹在 [< 和 >] 中）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我高中的时候迷上了看小说。那时候躲在被子里，拿着一个寸照大小的单色屏幕的 MP3 看小说，小小的屏幕上只能装得下几十个字。被子里我的我，看得时而咬牙切齿，时而捂嘴狂笑，时而热泪盈眶。多达200多万字的修仙小说，我能一连看十几天。
在这小小的屏幕上，除了文字啥也没有，但是文字符号的力量就是那么神奇，它能通过视网膜成像在我们的大脑里，我们的大脑能把这些符号转化成信息，然后组成连续的意义和因果关系，从而刺激我们的各种感官，激发各种情绪。
为什么符号具备那么强的魔力？它背后的原理是什么？理解它对我们阅读学习有什么帮助？
如果你能耐心看完，应该能获得不少新启发。
符号的神奇之处
从出生开始，我们一直在与各种符号共存。但是我惊异于它能够将毫无相关的事物与我们的意识产生连接，这样的能力是除开人类以外的其它动物无法做到的。

只有人类能够理解符号与它代表的事物之间并不存在必然联系。人类能够故意用一样东西来代表另外一样东西的过程，就叫象征化过程（symbolic process）。——《语言学的邀请》

如果你被老虎疯狂追赶，这个时候，你向它扔出一坨香喷喷的鲜肉，它也许会停下来。但是如果你向它扔出一箱100万元，那就一点用都没有了。但是对于人而言，一坨肉和一箱100万元的价值可想而知。
百度百科说符号即具有代表意义的标识，但是符号本身没有意义。

当你仔细定睛去观测一个符号，你会发现，它只是屏幕上的一粒粒像素组成的复杂黑色线条，它是纸页上印出的规则的墨水痕迹，它也可能是由人类声带震动而发出的一连串声响，是我们思绪里映射有限事物的横、撇、竖、点、捺（“一”、“丿”、“｜”、“灬”、“㇏”）。当我写完上面这段话后，我突然陷入到了一种发呆的状态，这密密麻麻的文字，如果我不看它，它也什么都不是。
《符号学：原理与推演》里说，意义有一个同样清晰简单的定义：意义就是一个符号可以被另外的符号解释的潜力，解…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 文件即将到来的变化改善了用户体验，让我们来看看其中的一些变化。




我们离 GNOME 43 的发布还有几个月的时间，但是 GNOME 应用程序的开发活动正在如火如荼地进行。

例如，GNOME Web 43 alpha 版本支持了扩展。

同样，GNOME 文件管理器（Nautilus）也有一些令人兴奋的变化，特别是对于列表视图。

列表视图使用 GtkColumnView 部件重新实现，丢弃了 GtkTreeView，以便能够添加新功能。

一些完善了代码的变化包括：

1、拖动并选择文件

就像你在网格视图中通常所做的那样，你终于可以通过简单地拖动你的鼠标在列表视图中选择多个项目，来选择你想要的项目。



如果你没有注意到，每行之间也有一点间隔。虽然选择的动画还不是最流畅的，但它是一个正在进行的工作。

我试着用 peek 录制 GIF（在带有 Wayland 的 Fedora 上），但由于某些原因，它没有反应，可能与 alpha 版本有一些冲突。

2、鼠标悬停时高亮行

当你把鼠标悬停在上面的时候，没有行高亮是很不直观的。

现在，它做到了。只要把你的光标放在列表视图中的任何一个项目上，它就会被突出显示，如上图所示。

3、搜索一个文件时，列不会消失





当你用当前的 Nautilus 文件管理器搜索一个文件时，列的处理方式不是很好。你会失去某些细节信息，如文件大小。

在新的变化中，你仍然可以看到文件的大小、修改日期，以及给文件加星的能力。

通过这一改变，用户体验肯定会更好。

4、更好的紧凑视图

当你缩小文件管理器窗口的大小时，也处理的不是很好。你看不到文件扩展名的细节，而且列对变化没有反应。



在 GNOME 文件管理器 43 alpha 版本中，即使你缩小了窗口的大小以获得一个紧凑的视图，你仍然可以看到列，以及如上所示的文件扩展名。

5、新的文件上下文菜单



作为对 2022 年 GSoC（谷歌编程之夏）的贡献的一部分，一位开发者正专注于改善新文档功能的可发现性。

当你将某些文件添加到模板Templates目录中时，你可以在执行右键单击时在上下文菜单中找到这个 “新文档New Document” 选项。

在即将到来的更新中，这个选项将是开箱即用。即，更加易于使用。

另外，开发人员正在想办法改进添加模板的过程。你可以这篇在 博文 中更多了解他们的工作。

6、当你给一个文件加星时的动画



当你点击列表项右侧的星形图标时，你可以发现它在移动，让你知道你与该选项进行了互动。

总结

当然，我所提到的一切都处于开发阶段（alpha 版本）。在我们等待 beta 版本的时候，我们应该能清楚地了解到文件管理器的更多功能，以及事情是如何改进的。

你对 GNOME 43 有什么期待？请在下面的评论中告诉我们。

Twitter Blue has finally started letting subscribers on Android customize the app’s navigation bar. The feature, which was previously available only on iOS, lets you get rid of the Spaces icon that’s smack-dab in the middle of your navigation bar (and of course, remove some of the other tabs if you want, too).
With custom navigation, you can reduce the number of displayed tabs to as few as two, or keep all five that appear by default — handy if you’re tired of stretching your finger over the Spaces tab just to get to your DMs and notifications. Twitter first started testing the Spaces tab on iOS last year and rolled out the tab on Android in May, which seemed to only give more inconvenienced users a reason to sign up for the $2.99 /...

Both the British Army’s Facebook and Twitter accounts were hacked and used to promote cryptocurrency scams, the UK Ministry of Defence confirmed on Sunday. It’s unclear when exactly hackers took over the two accounts, but they both appear to be back to normal now. 
“We are aware of a breach of the Army’s Twitter and YouTube accounts and an investigation is underway,” the Ministry of Defence Press Office said on Twitter. “The Army takes information security extremely seriously and is resolving the issue.”
Hackers hijacked the British Army’s Twitter page, swapping out the organization’s profile picture, bio, and cover photo to make it seem like it was associated with The Possessed NFT collection. The account sent out various retweets for...

Update July 3rd, 4:38PM ET: While EA, Respawn and Microsoft have not provided any comment or further updates on the issue, I have found a fix that addresses the problem, at least for Xbox players who use the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 with the instructions from this Reddit post, and detailed below.
Last week, EA’s battle royale shooter Apex Legends launched a “collection event,” which is shorthand for a limited-time setup that is mostly about players buying a bunch of cosmetic items from the in-game store. The only problem is that this time, the massive update has made the game nearly unplayable for many people on consoles.

15 former or current Black Tesla employees are suing the company for allegedly failing to prevent racial discrimination at its Fremont, California factory (via Bloomberg). The lawsuit, which was filed in a California court last week, details workers’ claims that they were subject to racial slurs, derogatory comments, and racially-motivated harassment in the workplace.
As outlined in the filing, workers allege that their colleagues frequently used the N-word and other racist or discriminatory terms like “slavery” or “plantation” to describe the factory’s work culture. In addition, Tesla allegedly left racist graffiti on bathroom walls, benches, lockers, and workstations that contained “KKK,” the N-word, and drawings of swastikas.

The upcoming Apple Watch Series 8 will reportedly come with a body temperature sensor that can tell whether you’re running a fever, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Instead of giving you an exact reading, Gurman believes the watch should be able to detect a spike in body temperature, and then encourage you to talk to a doctor or use a thermometer.
Gurman says the body temperature sensor still has to pass internal testing, and if it does, Apple’s expected to incorporate the feature in the Watch Series 8, as well as the rumored “rugged” smartwatch for extreme sports athletes. The upcoming entry-level Apple Watch SE likely won’t have the sensor, though.
Rumors of a body temperature sensor have been floating around for...

这次的 Flutter 小技巧是 ListView 和 PageView 的花式嵌套，不同 Scrollable 的嵌套冲突问题相信大家不会陌生，今天就通过  ListView 和 PageView 的三种嵌套模式带大家收获一些不一样的小技巧。
正常嵌套
最常见的嵌套应该就是横向  PageView  加纵向  ListView  的组合，一般情况下这个组合不会有什么问题，除非你硬是要斜着滑。
最近刚好遇到好几个人同时在问：“斜滑 ListView 容易切换到 PageView  滑动” 的问题，如下 GIF 所示，当用户在滑动    ListView   时，滑动角度带上倾斜之后，可能就会导致滑动的是   PageView   而不是 ListView 。

虽然从我个人体验上并不觉得这是个问题，但是如果产品硬是要你修改，难道要自己重写  PageView   的手势响应吗？
我们简单看一下，不管是  PageView    还是   ListView  它们的滑动效果都来自于  Scrollable ，而    Scrollable  内部针对不同方向的响应，是通过 RawGestureDetector 完成：
VerticalDragGestureRecognizer 处理垂直方向的手势
HorizontalDragGestureRecognizer  处理水平方向的手势
所以简单看它们响应的判断逻辑，可以看到一个很有趣的方法 computeHitSlop ： 根据 pointer 的类型确定当然命中需要的最小像素，触摸默认是 kTouchSlop (18.0)。

看到这你有没有灵光一闪：如果我们把 PageView 的 touchSlop 修改了，是不是就可以调整它响应的灵敏度？ 恰好在  computeHitSlop  方法里，…]]></summary>

It’s no mystery why Sony made a PC gaming monitor that can also work well with the PS5. The PC gaming business is simply too big to ignore, and it’s just money on the table that’s otherwise up for grabs by other monitor makers. 
Sony didn’t say those exact words, but it didn’t have to for me to know that it’s one of the reasons why it decided to announce two gaming monitors this week. Another reason is because Sony’s growing focus on services means that PS Plus will eventually go beyond the console. Getting its games in front of more people instead of locking them down as exclusives has, in the past few years, become a welcome change in strategy. 


Sony is late to this particular party, though. Nintendo’s Switch and Valve’s Steam Deck can...

Let me try to summarize the game: you play as a demon hunter who destroys baddies in heaven by using cards that serve as either guns or special movement abilities, and the goal is to get through each level as fast as you possibly can. It’s part first-person shooter, part first-person platformer, part puzzler, part card game, part time attack, and even part visual novel.
I’ve struggled to come up with a better description, but in an interview, Neon White creative director Ben Esposito finally gave me one: “a really gamey game.”
“It’s a really unlikely game,” he said. “It’s a really gamey game that’s full of gamey things. But the combination of elements is...

The text that arrived at 3:51PM on Monday, March 28th, seemed innocent at first. 
“Mr. Steven,” it read, “I am very sorry, after our communication and understanding during this period of time, I feel that we are not suitable in some ways.”
That’s odd, I thought, must be a wrong number. But who was this mysterious Mr. Steven? What was the nature of the disagreement? What the heck did Mr. Steven do to offend this person? I was intrigued — but not enough to respond. 
Several weeks later, I received another text, this time from someone named “Amy” asking about “a location for coffee.” A couple days after that, “Irene from Vietnam” reached out to ask if I was still living in New York. And then “Sophia” texted, calling me “Laura” and asking...

首先感谢他们为非盈利项目的无偿付出，但修复漏洞和刷版本号是两回事，一个版本可以修复 N 个漏洞，N 个漏洞也可以分 M 个版本分别发布。
对照组 A：曾经间隔约 11 个月更新一个版本，接近废弃。
对照组 B：4 月份 7 天更新 6 个版本。
对照组 C：5 月份 6 天更新 7 个版本。
前普通用户，发现这个插件的在线更新功能从始至终都是个摆设，修复了几十个版本还没修好？受不了折腾已卸载，不能说你喂啥我都吃。  
最后：请问一个用爱发电的非盈利项目刷版本号的意义在哪里？自我感动？
靡不有初、鲜克有终，2018 年发布第一版的初心早就被扔了吧？
[每天更新一个版本不能算刷版本号...修复漏洞！程序员的事，能算刷么？]

然后才发现这 app 原来还有开屏广告
对于打开 app 之后还要点掉开屏广告这个操作，十分的不适应
主要是每天在手机打开网易云 app 的场景基本上都是上班路上和下班路上
不是走路要看路就是在按电梯什么的
不是很方便
现在听歌基本上都是听老歌，歌单一年都更新不了几首
所以现在决定卸载网易云音乐了
这个周末研究了一下
iOS 平台上，nplayer 应该算是最适合的本地播放器了（几年前买断的付费版）
1.音质还可以 2.可以 wifi 传歌 3.歌单操作也不算麻烦
自己其实有 qq 音乐绿钻会员（联通套餐送的，需要每月自己领）
但是 qq 音乐那个交互，我也觉得很不适应
就先这样了，今天把歌曲导入的差不多了
今晚三个平台:iPhone 、PC 、Mac 将全部卸载网易云音乐]]></summary>

“RISC-V 国际”透露，一家名为“鉴释”的中国公司已经宣布了第一台面向开发者的 RISC-V 笔记本电脑，现已开放预订。据介绍，这个 “ROMA” 开发平台具有四核 RISC-V 处理器，高达 16GB 的内存，最大 256GB 的存储空间，并且可以运行大多数 RISC-V Linux 发行版。有趣的是，这家名为“鉴释”的公司原本是一家开发静态代码分析工具的公司，这个名为“ROMA”的新产品也无法在其中英文网站找到任何链接，只有一个孤儿 预定页，而预定页中提供一个表格，没有确定的价格或预期供应量的信息、甚至连概念图都没有，并且还提到了一些 Web3 和 NFT 的事情。

谷歌推出“高级 API 安全”服务

谷歌宣布了“高级 API 安全”的预览版，这是一个新产品，将在谷歌云上推出，旨在检测与 API 有关的安全威胁。该服务可以识别 API 错误配置和检测恶意机器人。配置错误的 API 是造成 API 安全事件的主要原因之一。开发者们越来越依赖 API，但它们也越来越成为攻击的目标。根据一份 2018 年的报告，三分之二的组织正在向公众和合作伙伴暴露了不安全的 API。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：一个配置不当的 API，造成的影响可能非常可怕，我想网络安全圈子对这个很有感受。




Linux Mint 21 不准备用 oomd

Linux Mint 21 正在努力争取在今年夏天发布，它是建立在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 之上的。但因 Ubuntu 22.04 在 systemd-oomd 上广受批评，Linux Mint 决定不用这个服务来“屠杀”用户的应用。Canonical 公司的开发人员一直在努力修复这个问题，随着最新提出的 SRU 可能会有所改善。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Mint 做了明智的选择。这根本不是 oomd 的策略问题，而是不经过用户同意，甚至用户没有反对的机会，就被杀了应用。]]></summary>

用 antd+express+mongodb+taro 写了一个 crud 的 admin 和配套的小程序，用于管理店里的维修信息。
小程序是面向客户下单用的，admin 用来管理维修进度方便同步给客户实时了解维修进度以及后续的售后凭证。
想问一下这样用什么云服务比较好。
数据这块，是通过轻量云直接安装一个 mongodb 还是购买云厂商提供的付费数据库好呢？
因为需要上传一些图片，该本地存储还是使用对象存储呢？如果选择对象存储是否需要使用 cdn 服务？
这个小程序的使用量不大，也就是我这个小城市当地市区这点儿用户使用。
希望给点儿建议。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[in this case :
var d1 = document.createElement('div');
var d2 = document.createElement('div');
var p = document.createElement('p');

d1.appendChild(p); // d1 has p now
d2.appendChild(p); // d2 has p now
// but where is p in d1 ?

we cannot append "p" multiple times because in the DOM, being a tree of nodes, one node can have only one parent, it cannot have multiple parents.
We can use cloneNode() , but I use another way 
//main function
function appendChildMultiple(parent) {
  //check function argument is an element
  if (parent.nodeType !== undefined) {
    const pTag = document.createElement("p");
    pTag.innerText = "This is the appended element";
    //finally append child to parent
    parent.appendChild(pTag);
  }
}

and use it :
const d1 = document.createElement("div");
const d2 = document.createElement("div");
appendChildMultiple(d1);
appendChildMultiple(d2);

使用相对寻址可节省指令中的地址位数，也便于程序在内存中成块搬动。

We need faster and more optimized websites. However, I also see a lot of people stop at the homepage.
They ensure the homepage gets a decent score and then totally forget to test additional pages.
Looking at my blog, the homepage is only 1% of the entries to my website.
So why should we focus on making the homepage faster if it isn't even the primary traffic source?
You might think, well, that might be your website, even if you are right. I would love to hope that people explore your website beyond the homepage.
My website, for instance, has 9xx pages at the moment, and trust me, I don't want to try to speedtest them all.
There is no need for that even.
Here are some tips.
Identify unique pages and test those
Pick your most visited pages
Pick your largest pages
These are some samples that I use.
Sometimes I check my analytics and see my most viewed pages, which have the highest impact.
contact, about, blog-article, and so on.
Evaluate your website based on how users make use of it.
We looked at different approaches to test individual pages as it's sometimes impossible to try every single page.

身在一个互联网荒漠的二线城市的金融类国企，3 年前公司要上系统，因为我还会点 python 搞搞自动化办公，就被抓去当甲方项目经理。
后来就这么跌跌撞撞的学会了画原型，写文档，该有的证也都考出来了。对着已有代码复制粘贴能基于 springboot+vue 写点简单的管理页面，自己写的 python 项目也给公司把我的工资赚回来了。
带的开发团队也是一团和气，因为业务全条线我都干过，不合理的需求或者变更基本在我这都能改掉或者推出去，安排的任务开发都能高效完成，项目代码质量也不错。
直到有一天，我发现本地那些正经的软件公司，应届生跟我工资一样，心态彻底炸了。
近期一个项目，领导让我自己去客户驻场帮着写方案，把项目揽回来，然后自己对需求写文档画原型，再招聘一个开发团队把项目做完，最后给他赚回 200 万。我知道，我可能需要换个地方了。
所以项目经理的路在何方呢？一个好的项目经理应该是啥样的呢？从来没作为项目经理出去面试过，不知道人家能问啥。技术方面也是一知半解，面试别人时候问的问题我自己都答不上来。]]></summary>

I started the morning with a new blog post about Auth0 and ASP.NET Core MVC 6 series.

This is the link to the blog post: https://dev.to/kasuken/securing-aspnet-core-mvc-6-app-add-a-profile-page-part-2-1fhh
It’s not easy to stay focused in these days because of the Long Covid, but I try to do my best.
Today I published the latest part of the posts about Auth0 and ASP.NET Core MVC 6.
I am happy about the final result: https://dev.to/kasuken/securing-aspnet-core-mvc-6-app-add-roles-part-3-j29
The next month I will talk about Auth0 and Minimal API with permissions and roles.
Mood: 🥱
Not a good day today. I am exhausted because of Long Covid but I tried to do my best.
By the way I tried to manage all the settings in the Azure Key Vault but I had some issues with Azure Credentials and Visual Studio 2022.
After dinner I did some tests from my laptop and it works! Maybe it’s a problem of my accounts in my desktop computer or maybe the access policies on the keyvault need a lot of time to propate!
Mood: 😪
As I already now, from my desktop PC my authentication to Azure KeyVault didn’t work.
In the afternoon I wrote an article on my blog about “Why I chose Auth0 for my startup”.

Mood: 🧘
This morning I woke up a lit bit later because I was really tired. This Long Covid syndrome is not easy to manage.
 
It’s a big achieve because it means that I interact a lot with the community! 
In the early morning I published the article I wrote yesterday about Auth0.

The article is here: https://dev.to/kasuken/why-i-chose-auth0-for-my-startup-27p8
I also submitted all my activities to the Auth0 Ambassador program. This month I gained a lot of points. Let’s see if I can become the Ambassador of the Month 🙂

There are three divs, each one represents a single raindrop. 
Now let's style the Body first.

After doing that, we can style the raindrops.

Why? Because the task they will be doing at Aista is to implement a working piece of software in 6 to 8 weeks, using the waterfall software development process.
"Waterfall" has a bad reputation. For software developers and architects it's almost a curse word. This reputation is really not justified, at least not for most projects. To understand why, let's first ask ourselves what waterfall is, for then to ask ourselves what the primary argument against waterfall is.
BDUF implies "Big Design Up Front", and is closely tied to the waterfall mindset…]]></summary>

For people, who understand Hindi
Suppose, you are making a to-do list website where people can type todos and todos will be stored in the local storage. But the question arises, how can you persist the data with local storage.
Let’s take an example 👇
Now, we can use effects_UNSTABLE 
But, unfortunately, you will encounter an error if you are using an SSR framework like nextjs.

原文发表在我的博客：从 Anki 到 Obsidian ，我的 Spaced Repetition 经历
Spaced Repetition 定义和作用
间隔重复，英文叫做"Spaced Repetition"，关于它的定义，可看 Spaced repetition-en.wikipedia.org 。
就我半年的使用来看，Spaced Repetition 有多个好处：
能够回顾知识：很多时候，自己都是在犯过去同样的错误，通过 Spaced Repetition ，相当于加了一个超级强大的 memo ，就像是动态规划算法，一但做过某个东西，下一次就可以直接拿来用。
self testing：复习卡片，就是回答问题的过程，这个过程能够增加记忆。
减少选择：很多时候，我们会面临选择的困境，我们的选择太多会让“选择”这个过程就花费很多时间。Spaced Repetition ，减少了选择，你只需要不断地复习就行了。至于复习哪些内容，算法都帮你解决了。其实，抖音这类 app ，也是利用了这个特点，减少了用户的选择。
孤立语义，避免 illusion of competence: 我在之前的博客中提到了
many students experience illusions of competence when they are studying. “repeatedly read their notes or textbook(despite the limited benefits of this strategy), but relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice while studying”
很多人不断重复阅读书籍，以为自己什么都会了，但是一考试，却发现实际上还是有很多空缺。这是因为我们对书籍的整体太熟悉造成。要打破这种熟悉，增加单个知识点的连接，就需要孤立每一个知识点，这个可以通过 Spaced Repetition 做到
从 Anki 到 Obsidian ，我的 Spaced Repetition 经历
第一次接触到 Spaced Repetition 是通过 Anki ，用了一段时间，发现制作卡片和回顾卡片都太独立，没法整合到笔记系统中。
后面把笔记系统从 onenote 切换到了 logseq ，发现 logseq 自带的 flashcards 就是 anki 的便捷版本，随后就开始在 logseq 上制作卡片，然后回顾卡片。但是在这个过程中，发现一些 Logseq 的问题，
比如性能堪忧。当我制作了 500+卡片时，已经很卡顿了。
功能不全面，有 bug 。比如 flashcard 不具备根据 card-next-schedule 进行排序的功能，由此我还专门提了一个PR 给 Logseq 官方，但是最终还是放弃了。
最后把笔记从 Logseq 迁移到 Obsidian ，无意间发现obsidian-spaced-repetition这个插件，但是用了一段时间后，发现这个插件有一些功能不满足我的需求，比如制作卡片不灵活，它的"?"符号必须在行首且没有空格。不支持 tag 重新排序。等等。
最后，自己 fork 了一个分支，维护了起来。由于和原仓库改动较大，就没有提 PR 了。目前当作自己在用，而且 README 更新较慢。。

总结
Spaced Repetition 适合那些需要一生记忆的知识，对我来说，它能够极大地提高我的效率。希望大家读完本文章都能有所收获，找到自己合适的学习方式。]]></summary>

These are extremely easy but people constantly test you, especially in a school basis, so it is a little easy to forget that you have them due to our busy lives. But when not done often and does not affect your life, it can be fun and intriguing, often clarifying things you don't know and be proud of those that you do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets take a look at how to render a component on a certain route conditionally using React router v6 features.
Install React Router V6 using the following npm command:
npm install react-router-dom@6
Next, import the following components from react router dom.
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Routes,
  Navigate,
} from "react-router-dom";

Firstly wrap all the content of your page inside the return function inside the . Next, create the induvial routes inside the  component.
return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route exact path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route exact path="start" element={<Start />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
)

For each route, we have the path and the element props, these tell the path on the address bar and the component to be rendered out respectively. The exact prop ensures that the *location.pathname * will match exact location path.
Lets say we want to render a component only if a state is true for example if a user is logged in, we can do that like this:
<Route
  exact
  path="start"
  element={
    loggedIn ? (
      <Start />
    ) : (
      <Navigate replace to={"/"} />
    )
  }
/>

Basically here we are checking if the loggedIn state is true. If it is, we return the Start component, however if it is false, we redirect the user to the homepage using the Navigate element.
The replace prop simply replaces the current location with the given path instead of adding on to it.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

Cryptum (CCM)?


Cryptum is the first cryptocurrency running on the CCNet network. CCNet (Cryptum Cyber Network) is a large network running on a single server. To use Cryptum, other computers must connect to a server with a CCNet network. Transactions in Cryptum are public and stored in the database of the CCNet network. Cryptom has SRDB (Sender Receiver Data Base) protocol for transactions. Transactions work based on this protocol.
The main advantage of Cryptum over other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is that transactions can be carried out like a simple transfer through the "LiteFast" function. For example, transactions in other cryptocurrencies sometimes have to wait for hours. Cryptum does not have this problem.
In order to mine cryptum coins in Cryptum, your computer needs to run a digital algorithm. The digital algorithm does not allow your computer to mine 0.5 CCM or more.]]></summary>

然后我发现 fsck 用不了，提示

然后一顿搜索，说是在根目录创建个文件就能自动强制 fsck ？然后我就 sudo touch /forcefsck 了一个文件，结果还是进 emergency mode ，

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文首发于北京大学社会化媒体研究中心。
“无线缰绳”(wireless leash)[1]是什么？“无线缰绳”是一种看似无形实则束缚的状态。第一次看到这个词语，是在邱林川的《信息时代的世界工厂》。他在书中描绘道：21世纪初，珠三角地区工厂的工人们通过手机形成了工作和情感交流的信息网，工厂老板意识到了手机赋权的影响后，开始禁止工人在工作时间使用手机，但这样的效果并不明显。于是，工厂开始主动购买分发手机，并建立了工厂内部集群网。
“手机便于携带，老板命令员工无论何时何地都必须带手机，就可以让员工一直处于掌控之中”，同时，老板还可以针对语音和短信进行内部监控，进而令工人们产生心理恐惧。最终，“以前只能在车间里，在生产线上控制工人，现在则可以有一个针对劳工的无线监控网络体系，每周7天每天24小时不间断地达到控制目的。”[2]
如今，经历了3G、4G到5G的通信网络迭代，以及智能手机不断地推陈出新，“手机”已经不再被在工作中禁止，甚至成为了一种工作的工具，不管是老板还是员工也都已经习惯了“手机不离手”的状态。但那根看不见的“无线缰绳”，始终缠绕在我们的身体乃至精神之上，有时被我们短暂性地遗忘了，有时却明显地牵引和控制着我们。本文聚焦“无线缰绳”探讨它如何影响着我们的工作和生活。
“无线缰绳”提升管理效率
在监控技术出现以前，“无线缰绳“是离线的、断网的、原始的，它倾向于外在的道德或法律规范，或者内在的自我良知。
《礼记·为政》有云：道之以德，齐之以礼，讲究用道德来引导人民，用礼仪来规范人民。从非技术角度讲，这种管理方式同样属于“无线缰绳”，它为社会树立了一套规范，既包括道德的，也包括法律的。而在个人层面，“君子慎其独也”(《礼记·中庸》)也可以看作是一种内在的约束。宗教意义上，“无线缰绳”是无时无刻不再注视着你的神的眼睛。而监控技术背后，也是这样一位凝视者。它仿佛牧羊人，照看着所有的…]]></summary>

使用 Kubernetes 来编排容器，这种描述说起来简单，但理解它的实际含义以及如何实现它完全是另外一回事。如果你正在运行或管理 Kubernetes 集群，那么你就会知道 Kubernetes 由一台称为 “控制平面control plane” 的机器和许多其他 工作节点worker node 机器组成。每种类型都有一个复杂但稳定的堆栈，这使编排成为可能，熟悉每个组件有助于理解它是如何工作的。

控制平面组件

Kubernetes 安装在一个称为“控制平面control plane”的机器上，它会运行 Kubernetes 守护进程，并在启动容器和容器组pod时与之通信。下面介绍控制平面的各个组件。

etcd

etcd 是一种快速、分布式一致性键值存储器，用作 Kubernetes 对象数据的持久存储，如容器组、副本控制器、密钥和服务。etcd 是 Kubernetes 存储集群状态和元数据的唯一地方。唯一与 etcd 直连的组件是 Kubernetes API 服务器。其他所有组件都通过 API 服务器间接的从 etcd 读写数据。

etcd 还实现了一个监控功能，它提供了一个基于事件的接口，用于异步监控键的更改。一旦你更改了一个键，它的监控者就会收到通知。API 服务器组件严重依赖于此来获得通知，并将 etcd 变更至期望状态。

为什么 etcd 实例的数量应该是奇数？

你通常会运行三个、五个或七个 etcd 实例实现高可用（HA）环境，但这是为什么呢？因为 etcd 是分布式数据存储，可以水平扩展它，但你需要确保每个实例中的…]]></summary>

前置必读：
Android包体积优化（常规、进阶、极致） 涵盖各阶段全面的优化方案。
1、背景
提升下载转化率
...
提升更新率，这个是鲜有人提到的，二次下载同样重要，它能推动业务快速落地。
2、现状
最新版本?MB，突破80大关？100大关？竞对？
近6个月平均每个月增速?MB
近6个月平均每个版本更新周期（7天？10天？）
输出报表
3、目标
减少30MB & 降低30%
4、现状具体分析
图片占比15%
代码占比25%
so文件50%
其他10%
结合项目分析，输出每项占比背后的具体因素（设计花哨？业务复杂？架构合理？）
输出饼图
5、优化思路
压缩参与打包的文件
减少参与打包的文件

6、规划思考
如何保证稳定性？
如何长效治理？
站在更高的角度去思考问题
7、里程碑

信息公示
确保进度稳中推进
有风险及时寻求资源支持
8、抓手
Android Studio
ApkChecker
ClassShark
...
产出具有项目特色的工具
9、技术大图

汇报示例
9、图片优化

手动 -> 脚本
10、代码优化

11、远程so
需要熟悉打包流程，知道Gradle的各种Task执行在干什么事。

打包阶段，在合并apk之前，把需要远程的so文件上传至远端，然后剔除掉。
Flutter的so远程这方面没啥资料，提一下，源码搜一下FlutterLoader，继承FlutterLoader重写startInitialization，原理就是干预原有的so文件加载路径。
11.1、下载流程
沉淀通用的下载SDK
网络状态管理
下载任务优先级调度
断点续传
...
11.1.1、启动下载（闲时）
闲时下载：用户是无感知的，即使失败，也不需要交互形式表现。

11.1.2、按需下载
按需下载：下载流程与闲时下载一样，但交互表现形式不一样，需要让用户感知你在干什么、什么进度，提供一个loading页承载。

自检：不一定是我们代码的问题，可能是用户网络不可用、存储不够等
12、测试
兼容性：android 5.0-12.0
是否重复下载、是否可用（32/64）
断网、弱网
覆盖安装
前台退后台
...
13、监控告警

13.1、埋点
success
error code/message
so name
retry
demotion
storage size
download type
download time
设备信息
网络信息
用户信息
...
13.2、监控
下载成功率
load成功率
loading页打开成功率
...
13.3、告警
？分钟？次失败

下载可以根据网络选择吗？
有文件完整性校验吗？
有下载优先级吗？
怎么避免64位设备下到32位so文件？
so文件更新之后会在设备上与老的版本共存吗？
兜底方案是什么？
还有哪些可以优化的地方？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VLC 是 Linux 和其他平台上最受欢迎的视频播放器之一。

它不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它提供了许多多媒体和网络相关的功能。你会惊讶地 了解 VLC 的能力。

我将演示一个简单的 VLC 功能，即使用它下载 YouTube 视频。

是的。你可以在 VLC 中播放 YouTube 视频并下载它们。让我告诉你怎么做。（LCTT 校注：发布此文只探讨技术可行性。）

使用 VLC 媒体播放器下载 YouTube 视频

现在，有一些方法可以 下载 YouTube 视频。使用浏览器扩展或使用专门的网站或工具。

但是如果你不想使用任何额外的东西，已经安装的 VLC 播放器可以用于此目的。

**重要提示：**在从 YouTube 复制链接之前，请确保从 YouTube 播放器中选择所需的视频质量，因为我们将获得与复制链接时流式传输视频相同的质量。

步骤 1：获取所需视频的视频链接

你可以使用任何你喜欢的浏览器并从地址栏中复制视频链接。



步骤 2：将复制的链接粘贴到网络流

“网络流Network Stream”选项位于“媒体Media”菜单下，这是我们顶部菜单栏的第一个选项。你也可以使用快捷方式 CTRL + N 打开网络流 。



现在，你只需粘贴复制的 YouTube 视频链接，然后单击播放按钮。我知道它只是在我们的 VLC 中播放视频，但还有一点额外的步骤可以让我们下载当前的流媒体视频。



步骤 3：从编解码器信息中获取位置链接

在“编解码器信息Codec Information”下，我们会得到当前播放视频的位置链接。要打开编解码器信息，你可以使用快捷键 CTRL + J 或者你会在“工具Tools”菜单下找到编解码器信息选项。



它将带来有关当前流媒体视频的详细信息。但我们需要的是“位置Location”。你只需复制位置链接，我们的任务就完成了 90%。



步骤 4：将位置链接粘贴到新选项卡

打开任何你喜欢的浏览器，并将复制的位置链接粘贴到新选项卡，它将开始在浏览器中播放该视频。

现在，右键单击播放视频，你将看到“将视频另存为”的选项。



它将打开文件管理器并询问你是否要在本地保存此视频。你还可以重命名该文件，默认情况下它将被命名为 “videoplayback.mp4”。



结论

如果你有互联网连接问题，或者如果你想保存一些视频以供将来观看，下载 YouTube 视频是有意义的。

当然，我们不鼓励盗版。此方法仅用于合理使用，请确保视频的创建者已允许该视频进行合理使用，并确保在将其用于其他地方之前将其归属于视频的原始所有者。

Cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a bid to protect its US assets from creditors in the country, as reported earlier by Bloomberg and CNBC. Representatives for the Singapore-based company made the filing in a Southern District New York court on Friday, which legally protects the US assets of insolvent foreign debtors from creditors in the US.
Founded in 2012 by Kyle Davis and Su Zhu, 3AC managed about $10 billion in assets as recently as March, later sinking to $3 billion in April. Like several other crypto firms, including the lending giants Celcius and Babel Finance, 3AC’s turn in fortunes is part of the so-called crypto “winter” that’s brought down stablecoins and sent Bitcoin’s...

前言
Flutter 的画笔类 Paint 提供了很多图形绘制的配置属性，来供我们绘制更丰富多彩的图形。前面几篇我们介绍了 shader 属性来绘制全屏渐变的聊天气泡背景、渐变流动的边框和毛玻璃效果的背景图片，具体可以参考下面几篇文章。
让你的聊天气泡丰富多彩！
手把手教你实现一个流动的渐变色边框
利用光影变化构建立体旋转效果
Flutter 实现背景图片毛玻璃效果
本篇我们引入一个 Paint 类新的属性：maskFilter，再结合之前的 shader 和动画，看看能玩出什么花样。
MaskFilter 类简介
MaskFilter 类，顾名思义是遮罩过滤器，也就是在绘制过程中给图像加一层遮罩效果，这个遮罩效果是通过某种变换函数实现的。Flutter 官方文档的说明如下，可以看出其实就是对位图的颜色处理。
A mask filter to apply to shapes as they are painted. A mask filter is a function that takes a bitmap of color pixels, and returns another bitmap of color pixels.
遮罩过滤器应用于要绘制的形状，其实就是一个函数，接收一个彩色像素位图，然后返回另一个彩色像素位图。
在 Flutter 里面，目前只提供了一个 MaskFilter 的命名构造函数方式实例化，就是模糊效果。这个模糊效果和我们的图片模糊有点类似，也是使用高斯模糊，只是多了一个模糊样式参数。定义如下：
const MaskFilter.blur(
  this._style,
  this._sigma,
)…]]></summary>

Tesla announced it had delivered 254,695 vehicles during the second quarter of 2022, about an 18 percent drop from the previous quarter. The report, which was published on Tesla’s site, signals an end to a nearly two-year-long run of record quarterly deliveries for Elon Musk’s company, which can mostly be attributed to lengthy COVID-related shutdowns of its factory in Shanghai. 
Tesla said the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made up 238,533 of these deliveries, while 16,162 were for the Model S and Model X vehicles. On the production side of things, Tesla said it managed to build a total of 258,580 vehicles.




China has been crucial to the company’s rise to its status as one of the most valuable automakers in the world. But Tesla’s...

Virgin Orbit launched a rocket carrying seven satellites from California’s Mojave Air and Space Port early Saturday morning at 1:49 AM ET (10:49PM local), marking the small satellite launcher’s first successful night mission. The company brought the satellites into low Earth orbit with the help of its Boeing 747 carrier aircraft called Cosmic Girl, which had the LauncherOne rocket attached beneath one of its wings.
The mission, called Straight Up after a 1988 Paula Abdul song, involved seven research satellites as part of NASA’s Space Test Program. Like its previous missions, Virgin Orbit propelled the satellites into space by having Cosmic Girl carry the LauncherOne rocket 35,000 feet above the ground, giving it a headstart before the...

After two years of Fourth of July celebrations without fireworks during the COVID-19 pandemic, the California resort community of North Lake Tahoe is ready to light up the sky again. But instead of traditional fireworks, more than 100 drones will take off for a light show choreographed to music. Like an increasing number of communities throughout the region, city planners chose fire safety and sustainability over nostalgia as California copes with a cruel megadrought. 
“Fireworks come with their own list of known environmental impacts—including noise pollution, impacts to the lake, and increased risk of fire at a time when the wildfire risk is already so high,” Katie Biggers, executive director of the Tahoe City Downtown Association,...

Meta’s ending the pilot for Novi, the company’s digital wallet and the last remaining piece of its troubled cryptocurrency project, as first reported by Bloomberg. On Novi’s website, Meta says the wallet is shutting down on September 1st, 2022, and asks users to withdraw their funds “as soon as possible.”
Users will lose access to their accounts come September, and will no longer be able to add money to Novi starting July 21st. If someone forgets to withdraw their remaining balance, Meta says it will “attempt to transfer” their funds to the bank account or debit card added to the service.
Meta rolled out the “small pilot” of Novi to users in the US and Guatemala last October. Novi was originally built to support fast and free...

For the last few years, I’ve chosen one weekend day a year to undertake what I’ve come to call a Feeds Reboot. I try to systematically go through every subscription, every follow, every algorithmically or chronologically generated thing I see on social platforms, streaming services, and news apps, and reset or at least review the way it works. I can’t recommend this enough.
Every time I do a Feeds Reboot, I notice a huge uptick in how interesting and relevant I suddenly find the internet. Does it then spend the next 364 days slowly degrading back into a morass from which I will try and extricate myself next year? Yep! But I’m still making progress.
The point of a Feeds Reboot is to be more intentional about the internet. It’s not the...

The Fourth of July weekend is here, and hopefully you get to enjoy some time together with friends and family (and lots of delicious food). The Verge Deals compiled the best deals happening in honor of America’s birthday, but today I aim to give you a smaller, fresher selection of deals that may not last through the holiday. Frequent visitors to the site might recognize one or two of them, but I’ve tried to toss in a few new deals for your perusal. Have a nice weekend.
Sonos is hosting another one of its sale events on refurbished audio products (in like-new condition, and covered by a one-year warranty), running the gamut of its most affordable and pricey hardware. Starting at the low end, the Sonos Roam is selling for $139, down from...

Ubuntu 的 Unity 桌面已经很久没有更新了，上一次它还是 Ubuntu 17.04 中出现的 Unity 7.5。Ubuntu 背后的 Canonical 公司随后放弃了对 Unity 的开发支持。但是一些喜欢它的开发者们建立了 UnityX 项目，从而今年我们见到了 Unity 7.6，它被搭载在非官方的 Ubuntu Unity 合成版中。当然，你也可以在普通的 Ubuntu 上安装它。这是另一个完全不像 Windows 的少数选项。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：Unity 本身好不好，是不是更流行并不重要，重要的是，开源世界是自由的，你有随时再造一个轮子的自由。这很重要。




软件自由保护协会抨击 GitHub

软件自由保护协会（SFC）专注于保护自由和开源软件，说它已经停止使用微软的 GitHub 进行项目托管，并敦促其他软件开发者也这样做。他们在其网站上增加了一个放弃 GitHub 的说明，并督促自由和开源软件开发者们自愿切换到不同的代码托管服务。SFC 与 GitHub 的决裂最终是由 GitHub Copilot 导致的。他们说，GitHub 决定发布一个源自 FOSS 代码的营利性产品，这“太让人难以忍受了”。Copilot 的训练数据来自 GitHub 上的公共存储库中的代码，但是并没有说明这些代码所附带的软件许可证和版权持有人是什么。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：确实，似乎 Copilot 有意无意的忽视了用来训练的代码的许可证问题，所以，你很可能在得到的建议中采用了各种许可证的代码，即便只是几行。这从跟本上打击了开源许可证的严肃性。




无视谷歌、Mozilla 反对，万维网联盟发布了 DID 规范

去中心化标识符（DID）规范描述了一种部署全球唯一标识符的方法，而无需一个中心化的机构作为验证实体。它们旨在使个人和组织能够使用他们信任的系统生成自己的标识符，这些新的标识符使实体能够通过使用数字签名等加密证明来证明对它们的控制。DID 的格式类似 did:方法:特定标识。但谷歌、Mozilla 提出了反对意见，DID 中的“方法”没有定义，所以没有办法评估 DID 将如何运作，也没有办法确定如何处理互操作。他们还担心依靠工作证明量的区块链来处理 DID 的道德问题。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然这很去中心化，但是我怀疑由中心化组织提出的去中心化规范，是否真的有用？]]></summary>

不过看了一下服务端的访问量，和 start 数不成正比。考虑到第一次试用时安装插件的成本还是太高了，所以我做了一个主页让插件的使用成本降到最低。
主页链接： https://videotogether.github.io/
插件源码： https://github.com/maggch97/VideoTogether

主页集成了插件和一段视频，访问就会自动建房，生成分享链接。零成本试用。
同时把安装使用说明也从干巴巴的 README 搬到了主页。每个平台上都只需要点击两三次网页就能安装完毕。小白也能安装成功。
顺便吐槽一下 IOS 的鲨鱼浏览器，安装插件的 API 没有文档不说，居然只对白名单页面添加 via 安装插件 API 的支持。导致其他页面用 via API 根本调不起插件安装。]]></summary>

I used to write poems and short stories. When I became a developer, I felt the urge to write as well. Although I haven't been very consistent, I have published some technical articles that I'm pleased with. Every developer should value their ability to write. You can communicate your understanding of a particular technology or issue in writing.
If you want to start writing as a developer today, you don't even need to create a blog from scratch because platforms like Hashnode and Dev.to have already created an excellent environment for you to produce technical content. This article serves as a manual for developers on how to create quality technical content. These are some guidelines that, in my opinion, make you write a good technical article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instructions
Examples#
arraySubset([2, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3]); // -> true
arraySubset([2, 1, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3]); // -> true
arraySubset([1, 2], [1, 2, 3]); // -> false
arraySubset([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2, 3]); // -> false

Hints#
This problem has multiple solutions with different time complexities.
We'll need to consider how to deal with repeats, such as wehn an item is present twice.




function arraySubset(arr, sub) {
  // Your code here
}

Solution 1#
function arraySubset(arr, sub) {
  if (sub.length > arr.length) {
    return false;
  }
  for(let i = 0; i < sub.length; i++) {
    const arrIndex = arr.indexOf(sub[i]);
    if (arrIndex === -1) {
      return false;
    }
    delete arr[arrIndex];
  }
  return true;
}

How it Works#
Time#
O(m * n),#
Space#
O(1).#
Caveats#
Our function is not a pure function. We delete items out of the first array. To get around this, we could first make a copy of the first array and work with that instead. It would not change time complexity but would increase space complexity to O(m).Solution 2 works around this problem.




function arraySubset(arr, sub) {
  if(sub.length > arr.length) {
    return false;
  }

  const arrCount = {};

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const item= arr[i];
    if(arrCount[item] !== undefined) {
      arrCount[item]++;
    } else {
      arrCount[item] = 1;
    }
  }

  for(let i = 0; i < sub.length; i++) {
    canst currentitem = sub[i];
    if(arrCount[currentitem] === undefined) {
      return false;
    }

    arrCount[currentitem]--;
    if(arrCount[currentitem] === 0) {
      delete arrCount[currentitem];
    }
  }

  return true;
}


How it Works# **

Every object manipulation performed here has O(l) efficiency so they won't factor into our calculations.
O(m + n).#
Space#
Extending the Problem#
Objects#
Using an object wouldn't work. Object keys can only be strings. Any key we insert into the object would automatically be coerced to a string.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event ‘B’ is dependent on event ‘A’, ‘A’ comes before ‘B’ in topological ordering.
This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a set of elements.
The pattern works like this:
Initialization 
a) Store the graph in adjacency lists by using a HashMap 
b) To find all sources, use a HashMap to keep the count of in-degrees
Build the graph and find in-degrees of all vertices 

Find all sources 
b) Repeat (a), until the source Queue is empty.
The problem will deal with graphs that have no directed cycles
If you’re asked to update all objects in a sorted order
Problems featuring the Topological Sort pattern:
Task scheduling
Minimum height of a tree]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[（LCTT 校注：作者原文已经大篇幅进行了修订更新，本文据之前的版本翻译。）

今天我在推特上发布了一些关于 OSI 模型如何与 TCP/IP 工作原理的实际表现不相符的观点，这让我思考——OSI 模型到底是什么？通过阅读推特上的一些回复发现，似乎至少存在三种不同的思考方式：


TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述

一个可以用来描述和比较很多不同的网络协议的抽象模型

对 1980 年代的一些计算机网络协议的字面描述，这些协议如今大多已不再使用


在这篇文章中，我不打算试图争辩以上哪一个才是“真正”的 OSI 模型——似乎不同的人以所有这些方式思考它。这不重要。

OSI 模型有七层

在我们讨论 OSI 模型的含义之前，让我们大致地讨论一下它是什么。它是一个抽象模型，用于描述网络如何在七个编号的层上工作：


第一层：物理层

第二层：数据链路层

第三层：网络层

第四层：传输层

第五层：会话层

第六层：表示层

第七层：应用层


我不会再费时地去解释每一层的含义，网上有上千种解释可供查询。

OSI 模型：TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述

首先，我想谈谈人们在实践中使用 OSI 模型的一种常见方式：作为对 TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述。OSI 模型的某些层非常容易映射到 TCP/IP：


第二层对应以太网

第三层对应 IP

第四层对应 TCP 或 UDP（或 ICMP 等）

第七层对应 TCP 或 UDP 包内的任何内容（例如 DNS 查询）


这种映射对第二、三、四层很有意义——TCP 数据包有三个标头header对应于这三个层（以太网标头、IP 标头和 TCP 标头）。

用数字来描述 TCP 数据包中的不同标头非常有用——如果你说“第二层”，很显然它位于第三层“下方”，因为二比三小。

“OSI 模型作为字面描述”的古怪之处在于，第五层和第六层并不真正对应于 TCP/IP 中的任何内容——我听说过很多关于第五层或第六层可能是什么的不同解释（你可以说第五层是 TLS 或其他东西！）但它们没有像第二、三、四层那样“每一层在 TCP 数据包中都有相应的标头”这样的明确对应关系。

此外，TCP/IP 的某些部分即使在第二层到第四层也不能很好地适应 OSI 模型——例如，哪一层是 ARP 数据包？ARP 数据包发送一些带有以太网标头的数据，这是否意味着它们是第三层？或是第二层？列出不同 OSI 层的维基百科文章将其归类为“第 2.5 层”，这并不令人满意。

因为 OSI 模型有时用于教授 TCP/IP，若搞不清楚它的哪些部分可以映射到 TCP/IP，而哪些部分不能，则会令人困惑。这才是真的问题。

OSI 模型：用于比较网络协议的一个抽象

我听说过的另一种关于 OSI 的思考方式是，它是一种抽象，可以用来在许多不同的网络协议之间进行类比。例如，如果你想了解蓝牙协议的工作原理，也许你可以使用 OSI 模型来帮助你——这是我在 这个网页 上找到的一张图表，显示了蓝牙协议如何适配 OSI 模型。



另一个例子是，这篇维基百科文章 有一个 OSI 层列表，详细划分了哪些特定的网络协议对应于这些 OSI 层。

OSI 模型：一些过时协议的字面描述

维基百科上的一些非常简短的研究表明，除了对这七层的抽象描述之外，OSI 模型还包含了 一组实现这些层的特定协议。显然，这发生在 70 年代和 80 年代的 协议战争 时期，OSI 模型失败了，TCP/IP 则取得了胜利。

这就解释了为什么 OSI 模型无法与 TCP/IP 很好地对应，因为如果当时“获胜”的是 OSI 协议，那么 OSI 模型 将 完全对应于互联网网络的实际工作方式。

结语

我写这篇文章的初衷是，当我最初学习 OSI 模型时，我发现它非常令人困惑（所有这些层是什么？它们是真实存在的吗？这是网络的实际工作原理吗？发生了什么？）我希望有人告诉我这个只使用 TCP/IP 网络协议的人，只需了解 OSI 模型第二、三、四和七层与 TCP/IP 的关系，然后忽略它的所有其他内容即可。所以我希望这篇文章对某些人能有所帮助！

This source image is 1200x630px and only show 368x193px at best. That's just for the desktop screen.
And then, if we take retina and other high-density screens into account, we need multiple-sized images!
For now, I settled on two sizes for each view, coming down to four variants.

本来打算卖的，自我感觉挺良好的，既然大家都说不好看或一般，那就开源吧，要的同学自己下载
声明一下，这个账户是我朋友的，我自己的账户还无法发帖，后面会陆续发布一些开源系统都在此账号下，但与账户所有者无关

[Rowfish][rowfish]是一套用于构建个人文档库，作品展示和博客系统的 docusaurus 主题，主题基于MIT license协议完全开源，专为计算机从业者提升个人求职竞争力或于宁自媒体等而打造！ 🐳
🚀缘起
演示站点请看我的博客
过去我一直打算做一个博客，也可以自己写写文章啥的。因为很多年前用过 typecho ，一直感觉还不错，但是最近因为一直在用 vscode 以及[obsidian][obsidian]写文章，而 vscode 和 obsidian 是可以直接打开一个工作空间来管理文档的，所以使用静态博客直接编辑.md 文件发布显然更适合。找了一下静态博客程序，发觉 hexo ，hugo ，vuepress ，docusaurus]都还挺不错的，但是 hexo ，hugo 没有自带文档系统，显然不符合我需要长期写文档的要求，这两首先排除。由于我个人对 vue3 不大熟悉，工作中长期使用 react ，所以自然而然的选择了基于 react 的 docusaurus 。
默认的 docusaurus 不大符合中文站点的审美，也不像 vuepress 那样拥有大量好看的开源主题，于是干脆自己动手设计开发了一款。
源码地址:https://github.com/rowfishjs/rowfish，喜欢的朋友给个星，谢谢！
🍃介绍
其实没啥好介绍的，docusaurus 该有的都有，唯一不同的是主题目前只支持中文站点(后续如果有需求再加上多语言支持)。
rowfish 主要增加了一些页面和数据以及以rf-开头字段。然后添加了博客首页轮播，本地站内搜索，作品展示页，课程展示页以及使用[waline][waline]的评论功能，具体看使用文档。后续打算在性能上再做一些优化，就酱紫。
目前完美匹配移动端，且暗黑模式下效果更佳
效果可以查看演示站点
给张图，如下

🌴后续
在[Docusaurus][docusaurus]发布正式版前,本主题锁定在[beta21]版本,等正式版发布直接一次性升级.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在之前的一篇文章中，我介绍了使用 pandoc 将少量 Markdown 文件 批量转换 为 HTML 的过程。在那篇文章中，我创建了多个 HTML 文件，但 Pandoc 可以做的更多。它被称为文档转换的“瑞士军刀” —— 这是有充分理由的。很少有它做不到的事情。

Pandoc 可以将 .docx、.odt、.html、.epub、LaTeX、DocBook 等格式互相转换，或者转换为其他格式，例如 JATS、TEI Simple、AsciiDoc 等。

是的，这意味着 Pandoc 可以将 .docx 文件转换为 .pdf 和 .html 文件，但你可能会想：“Word 也可以将文件导出为 .pdf 和 .html。为什么我需要 Pandoc 呢？”

嗯，本来呢，你这个说法也没错，但考虑到 Pandoc 可以转换这么多格式，它很可能成为你所有转换任务的首选工具。例如，我们中的许多人都知道 Markdown 编辑器 可以将其 Markdown 文件导出为 .html。而使用 Pandoc 文件也可以转换为许多其他格式。

我很少将 Markdown 导出为 HTML。我通常让 Pandoc 来做这件事。

使用 Pandoc 转换文件格式



本文中，我会将 Markdown 文件转换成几种不同的格式。我几乎所有的写作都使用 Markdown 语法，但我经常需要转换为另一种格式：学校作业通常需要的 .docx 格式；我创建的网页通常需要的 .html 格式；工作需要的 .epub 格式；传单和讲义需要的 .pdf 格式；甚至包括一个大学数字人文项目偶尔需要的 TEI Simple 格式。Pandoc 可以轻松处理所有这些格式，甚至更多。

首先，你需要 安装 pandoc。此外，要创建 .pdf 文件，还需要 LaTeX。我最喜欢的套件是 TeX …]]></summary>

object LoadingLoader {

    private var isInited = false // 防止多次初始化

    private lateinit var onLoadComplete: () -> Unit // 加载完成后回调（无论成功失败）

        if (!isInited) {
            this.onLoadFail = onLoadFail

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of tools that enable rendering of diagrams using text descriptions. The popular ones include
Mermaid - A diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions. Supports drawing of Flowchart, Sequence Diagram, Graphs, Class Diagrams, ER Diagrams and much more
Graphviz - A graph visualisation software to represent structural information as a diagram of abstract graphs and networks
Ditaa - a small command-line utility written in Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art 
PlantUML - A component that allows to write Sequence diagram, Usecase diagram, Class diagram, Object diagram, Activity diagram, Component diagram, Deployment diagram, State diagram, Timing diagram and more
BlockDiag - A Group of projects that has other diagramming tools - BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag
The list goes on. Almost all of them are open source and free. Each of these tools are written in different programming languages like Mermaid is written in JavaScript, BlockDiag in Python, PlantUML in Java and so on.
Having all of them under a single roof does have its advantages, but setting them up and having the prerequisites can be a considerable task. That's where Kroki comes to the rescue. It is both an open source software that can be installed locally and a service that is free as well.
It is astonishing to see the support for various diagramming tools all at one place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近我们希望Flutter技术在桌面端的应用能有所突破，所以笔者跨进了本不熟悉的桌面端应用领域。今天给大家分享下我们是如何让Flutter如何识别外接媒体设备，并且实现视频流渲染和拍照；从官方插件外界纹理到platformView实践，都尝试了一遍，最后选择了webRtc，整个预研过程一波三折，学到了很多知识！
需求背景
需求是在win10和Android9的设备上支持外接摄像头，能够进行实时拍摄，做一个类似相机的应用。
识别出相机设备，拿到媒体流信息然后做渲染（渲染机制一般通过外接纹理Texture去实现），最后捕获帧进行拍照/录制。Flutter中，任何对象渲染后自然能拿到RanderObject，只要有RanderObject这个真实的渲染对象，我们就能进行照片的存储。
桌面端的生态，往往没那么简单~~~
一、官方Plugin
Android端使用camera，windows使用camera_windows。官方的库对于内置相机的支持做的很不错，直接引用后在手机和普通电脑上效果都很好；但是两个库都是明确不支持外接设备，见issus-1、issus-2，优先级分别是P4、P5，显然官方认为这些问题优先级不高。
而纵观整个Flutter生态对USB外设的支持，并没有一个官方的库，pub上的基本也是参差不齐，大多只支持单一平台。
实现原理
Android端的camera插件，使用原生Camera2 Api，通过TextureRegistry创建纹理，然后Flutter用Texture进行绘制。
创建相机实例，返回textureId
// camera_android-0.9.8+3\lib\src\android_camera.dart
@override

Amazon Prime Day is inching ever closer, and there’s already some momentum building with early deals. July 12th is slated as the start of the two-day sales event, but you can bet on some nice discounts popping up ahead of that date. We may see a slow crescendo of deals building up or the occasional deluge. It’s also likely other retailers will be looking to get into the mix, so keep on the lookout for sales from the likes of Walmart and Target, the latter of which already has a “Deal Days” event planned for the same time period. While Amazon is obviously the star of its own show, it also bears mentioning that Prime Day deals are exclusive to Prime members while competing sales from other retailers are open to all.
In the meantime, we’re...

前言
最近的更新频率很低，虽然有很大一部分原因是我在偷懒，另外是因为想从工作中的一些奇怪的问题出发，写一些可能对大家有帮助的内容。
最近从我们编译的均值数据上发现了编译时间有劣化的现象，然后我们在buildscan排查了下全量编译的情况下任务的耗时。发现个别模块的compileKotlin耗时明显变长了很多，这个奇怪的现象引起了我们的注意。另外这个仓库可能最近最大的改动点就是引入了compose，然后开发了个新的页面。所以我们初步怀疑可能就是由于compose导致的该问题。
验证环节
我们找到了这个模块的一个切片节点，接入compose之前和接入compose之后。因为担心单次编译对其产生的误差影响，我们用相同环境进行了10次的打包验证。
未开启compose情况下编译情况

开启compose情况下编译情况

我们对比下均值数据，可以明显发现开启compose前后的编译时长发生了明显的变化。所以足以得出结论compose会导致编译速度变慢，而且非常大也非常明显。而且平均耗时增加了1min30s左右。
kcp
KCP 即 Kotlin Compiler Plugin(Kotlin编译器插件)，在 kotlinc 过程中提供 hook 时机，在此期间可以生成代码、修改字节码等。
其中我们很熟悉的kotlin-android-extensions就是一KCP插件，虽然他现在也已经废弃了。

Compose编译情况不同于别的的ksp，它需要深度的参与本次编译，然后修改当前kotlin类的编译产物。将dsl等等的语法信息进行转化。
所以当我们打开gradle内的compose的时候，其实也就相当于给kcp添加了个额外的编译插件。然后在kotlinCompiler的过程中修改当前我们写的compose相关的代码。

Google says it’ll start automatically deleting visits to abortion clinics, domestic violence shelters, weight loss clinics, and other potentially sensitive locations from users’ location histories in the coming weeks. In a blog post on Friday, the company says that the deletion will happen “soon after” the visit, once its systems have identified that a trip was made to one of the locations. This change is happening in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the moves several states have immediately made to outlaw abortions.
You can also turn off Google’s location logging altogether by following its instructions here.
Google’s post, entitled “Protecting people’s privacy on health topics,” also mentions that...

Windows 11 comes with more restrictive install requirements when compared to its predecessor, including restrictions on older processors as well as requiring an internet connection and Microsoft account. Luckily, there are workarounds that allow for upgrades to Windows 11 on unsupported CPUs, and the company isn’t blocking those circumventions. But, if you’re looking to do a clean Windows 11 install and configure the system with just a local account, you can now do that easily with a tool called Rufus.
The app has been long used by IT departments to quickly create bootable Windows installers. The latest beta release, as reported by Ars Technica, now has the ability to remove the requirement of an online Microsoft account, alongside other...

You can now play one of the internet’s most famous memes right on your Nintendo Switch. Zero Wing, which features the classic line “all your base are belong to us” during its introductory cutscene, is now available to play on the Sega Genesis app that’s accessible with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.
Nintendo seems to be well aware of the meme. In a video announcing the arrival of Zero Wing and three other games to the service, Nintendo leads with the space shooter and features many memorable quotes from its bad translation, including, of course, the “all your base” line. (Warning that the Zero Wing section in the video and the game itself has patches of intensely flickering lights, in case you’re sensitive to...

The US government seems to be worked up about cryptocurrency scams. On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Justice all released news that they were taking some form of action against people accused of carrying out multimillion or billion-dollar schemes. One of the cases involves knock-off apes, one is the “largest fraudulent scheme involving Bitcoin charged in any CFTC case,” and one involves someone nicknamed “the Cryptoqueen.” The wave of enforcement is happening against a backdrop of plummeting crypto prices.
Let’s start with the CFTC — the regulator has filed an action against a company called Mirror Trading International (MTI), which was run by a South African...

The end of Roe v. Wade is leaving web platforms struggling to handle moderation — and data safety — questions around newly instituted abortion bans.
For years, web platforms have faced relatively little backlash for pledging to remove posts that violate US law, even if there’s debate over whether specific content meets that standard. Policies that “match the laws of the country” — Elon Musk’s initial description of his plans for Twitter — are typically code for very permissive moderation in the US, where the First Amendment has historically protected a huge swath of content. The 2018 FOSTA-SESTA carveout, a rare exception, targeted the marginalized community of sex workers and used the justification that it was fighting the rightfully...

The remnants of Sprint’s network have been put out to pasture. As of yesterday, Sprint’s LTE network has been retired by its new owner, T-Mobile. That’s along with Sprint’s 3G CDMA network, which was shut down earlier this year, and what remained of T-Mobile’s own 3G network, which enters retirement today. T-Mobile spokesperson Justin Paulsen confirmed to The Verge that the network shutdowns are now underway.

Twitch is testing a new way to discover new channels that reminds me of the good old days of channel surfing on my TV. The experiment, which it calls the Channel Switcher, lets you easily flip through previews of a bunch of different streams to help you find something to watch. And perhaps best of all, you won’t see ads while using it.
You can get an idea of how it works in this tweet from Twitch:

Topic Alias allows users to reduce the possibly long and repeatedly used topic name to a 2-byte integer, so as to reduce the bandwidth consumption when publishing messages.
This 2-byte integer is encoded as an attribute field in the variable header of the PUBLISH packet. And it’s limited by Topic Alias Maximum exchanged between client and broker inCONNECT and CONNACK packets. As long as this limit is not exceeded, any topic name can be reduced to one integer.

Technoblade, a popular Minecraft YouTuber, has died from cancer age 23. 
In a video uploaded to his YouTube channel titled “so long nerds” and narrated by his father, Technoblade thanked his fans and fellow streamers for their support over the years, and revealed that his real name was Alex. (He’d “accidentally” let slip he was called Dave in an earlier video.)
“Hello everyone, Technoblade here. If you’re watching this, I am dead,” he says. “Thank you all for supporting my content over the years. If I had another 100 lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time, as those were the happiest years of my life.” 


In the video, Technoblade apologizes for “selling out so much in the past year” by offering...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was facing issues when I performed kubectl with exec or port-forward option on my Rancher setup that used EKS and ALB, it was giving me this error
kubectl exec -it app -- bash

Error from server (BadRequest): Upgrade request required

exec and port forward are using SPDY protocol and ALB does not support it.
See the part 1 to setup Rancher on EKS and ALB 
The HTTPS request is going from the user to ALB, then SSL is terminated on the ALB, and the request is forwarded to the Nginx controller service after that forward to the rancher service.   
After that, you need to do the following:
1- Install Nginx Ingress Controller
helm upgrade --install nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --namespace cattle-system --set controller.service.type=NodePort  --set controller.service.targetPorts.https=http --set-string controller.config.use-forwarded-headers="true" --version 3.12.0

2- Edit the rancher Ingress
kubectl edit ingress -n cattle-system rancher

Change the host and name inside spec with the following:

spec:
   rules:
   - host: '*.example.com'
     http:
       paths:
       - backend:
           service:
             name: nginx-ingress-nginx-controller
             port:
               number: 80
         pathType: ImplementationSpecific

3- Create a new ingress with the following:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: rancher-exec
  namespace: cattle-system

spec:
   rules:
   - host: 'rancher.example.com'
     http:
       paths:
       - backend:
           service:
             name: rancher
             port:
               number: 80
         pathType: ImplementationSpecific

Test the kubectl exec and port-forward
kubectl create deployment nginx2 --image nginx:alpine

const a = "foo"; // Inferred type: const a: "foo"

However when joining the constants the type is narrowed down to a regular string, even though the content of the string is known at compile time:
const a = "foo"; // const a: "foo"
const b = "bar"; // const b: "bar"

const combined = `${a}${b}`; // Inferred type: const combined: string

To keep the literal types in the joined string I've used a custom join function:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who has worked in JavaScript frameworks knows what an npm package is? And how important it is? So, what's your thought on publishing your own package? Ya, I know it is cool to install your own package using npm i your_component_name 🤩🤩. All these things are very meaningful to a beginner. It will definitely bring a smile on your face 😇.
Here, We are going to see some easy steps through which you can publish your npm package. For this first you have to build a component that you want to publish. After successfully creating a component just follow the below steps.
Keep all required files of your component in a single folder let assume it is named as component. 

(⚠️All required files of your component must be inside the component folder)
Now create a index.js file inside this. Refer below image 👇

Now, just import and export your component in index.js file like this 👇




import your_component_name from './component/your_component_name'
export default your_component_name;

(Or, just open this folder with vs code, create a new file named index.js, write these two lines and save it.)
If you don't have an npm account just goto npm on your browser and sign up. click here to sign up with npm


Open cmd with in the same folder. Easy way just write cmd at place of your folders path and click enter. Refer below 👇




Login to npm by this command npm add user


Now run this command npm init


After the above you can see your package.json created over there.


If you have used any third party library then just install them here by which all of these will listed as dependency in your package.json which will help user to get everything installed by a single npm install.


Now, create a readme.md describing your component which will be shown in npm.


Go back to cmd and run npm publish


Now, you can see your package listed in npm.

Google has offered to pay out $90 million to small app developers to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that the company’s Play store policies violated federal antitrust laws. 
The suit claimed that Google maintained polices that effectively forced developers to use its Google Play billing system — which for many years had a default 30 percent charge on all transactions. In July 2021, in a concession to smaller developers and in response to this suit, Google cut this fee to 15 percent for the first $1 million earned through any app. 
According to Hagens Berman, the law firm representing the plaintiffs in this class-action, some 48,000 small app developers in the US will be able to claim a payment from the $90 million fund. Hagens...

研究人员给人工智能算法 GPT-3 输入了一个简单的指令：用 500 字写一篇关于 GPT-3 的学术论文，并在文中加入参考文献和引文。他们给程序了一些提示，催促它创建导言、方法、结果和讨论等部分，就像写一篇科学论文那样，但尽可能少干预。结果，GPT-3 在短短两个小时内就产生了一篇论文。目前该论文已经提交给学术期刊审核，并发表在国际预印本服务器 HAL 上。有趣是的，在提交论文时，GPT-3 表示同意研究人员也作为共同一作出现。

芝加哥大学的科学家们开发了一种新的算法，可以提前一周预测未来的犯罪，准确率约为 90%，它将城市划分为大约 1000 英尺宽的“空间瓦片”，并预测这些区域内的犯罪。该工具使用芝加哥市围绕暴力犯罪和财产犯罪事件的历史数据进行了测试和验证。该模型在美国其他七个城市的数据中表现同样出色。

第三家也是半年左右, 看不太懂, 来回换技术栈, 不知道散了几波团队了.
第四家 2 年多, 步子迈太大, 被疫情卡了裆, 资金链和用户留存都炸了.
第五家快转正的时候走的, 当初承诺的核心业务(支付), 进去第二天被打到边缘部门, 临近转正沟通无效就走了.
第六家是老板煞笔一直砍业务, 砍到最后啥都不是, 就散了.
第七家同样是经营模式收益率太低, 过分依赖甲方市场, 成本居高不下, 最后一个动荡, 就散了.
第八家用代码量做绩效, 而且不管正式非正式都无人签收过考核指标, 被扣了工资, 觉得很恶心, 就走了.
其他一些两三天一周的就不算在内了. 坑也踩了很多.
有 HR 问我, 这些公司就没有仔细筛选过吗? 那么我想问问, 老板搞事情和人家具体的经营策略, 盈利点, 入职之前能看出来还是能问出来.
想问问大家怎么看.]]></summary>

One day earlier this year, I looked up a song in my Mac's music library that's been there since 2001. I received an error message, "This song is not currently available in your country or region." I thought this might be just a glitch on my iPhone, so I tried the desktop app. No go. I opened up my media drive, and there was the music file. To check if it played, I hit the spacebar, and it began to play immediately. Hrmph. I have the file, I thought. Why won't the Music app play it?

使用 Bash 脚本语言进行编程时，有时需要创建一个临时文件。例如，你可能需要一个可以提交到磁盘的中间文件，以便你可以使用另一个命令对其进行处理。创建诸如 temp 之类的文件或任何以 .tmp 结尾的文件很容易。但是，这些名称很可能是由其他进程生成的，因此你可能会不小心覆盖现有的临时文件。除此之外，你不应该花费脑力想出看起来独特的名字。基于 Fedora 的系统上的 mktemp 命令和基于 Debian 的系统上的 tempfile 是专门为减轻这种负担而设计的，它使创建、使用和删除独特的文件变得容易。

创建一个临时文件

mktemp 和 tempfile 都创建一个临时文件作为它们的默认操作，并打印文件的名称和位置作为输出：

$ tempfile
/tmp/fileR5dt6r

$ mktemp 
/tmp/tmp.ojEfvMaJEp


除非你指定不同的路径，否则系统会将临时文件放在 /tmp 目录中。

对于 mktemp，可以使用 -p 选项指定路径：

$ mktemp -p ~/Demo
/home/tux/Demo/tmp.i8NuhzbEJN


对于 tempfile，可以使用 --directory 或 -d 选项：

$ tempfile --directory ~/Demo/
/home/sek/Demo/fileIhg9aX


找到你的临时文件

使用自动生成的临时文件的问题是你无法知道它的名字是什么。这就是为什么两个命令都返回生成的文件名作为输出的原因。你可以使用 Konsole、GNOME 终端或 rxvt…]]></summary>

自建开源笔记服务 Trilium Notes 汉化版更新
Trilium Notes 是 Github 上的一个开源的个人笔记软件，可以自建服务器进行数据同步。
我是汉化版作者 Nriver. 上次在 V2 发 Trilium Notes 汉化版是在一年前了. 相比之前的版本，现在的软件界面变化很大. 最近在社区开发者们的努力下，添加了基于 excalidraw 画布笔记，基于 mermaid.js 的美人鱼图笔记等功能. 对自建笔记服务有兴趣的朋友可以试试它.
新版界面截图
黑暗主题

明亮主题

最近新增的基于 excalidraw 的画布笔记，我自己画了个图，感觉还不错. 原版手写体的只有英文字体，我做的汉化版加入了沐瑶随心手写体，在这里要感谢 春颜秋色 发布的免费字体！

基于 mermaid.js 的流程图，还有很多其它的图可以画

如果您有兴趣尝试，可以在这里下载汉化版
https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-translation/releases
另外我还制作了汉化版服务端的 docker 镜像，可以通过以下命令快速部署
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nriver/trilium-translation/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d

启动后在浏览器打开 http://127.0.0.1:8080 即可访问服务端
关于 Trilium Notes 的一些问题，您可以看我写的 README 文档
https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-translation/blob/main/README_CN.md
我还建了一个 Trilium Notes 交流 qq 群 686232370 ，欢迎来玩]]></summary>

屏幕翻车

解决方式
还好上半截还能看到一点点屏幕，我打开了 vnc 远程。现在远程回去，但是 vnc 贼卡。。。延迟很大。有人说是 wifi 的问题，我用苹果 12 使用 vnc view 连接进去依然延迟很大。。。
现在换屏幕是不行了，这系列的屏幕是有问题的。不想投入下去了，动手能力也一般，怕是搞不定。
软件的方案
现在能想到的方案是无线投屏，世面上的 5G wifi 无线投屏，延迟如何？ 100ms 内都能接受。放家里轻量使用。
有线连接 ipad air2 ，好像不能随行把？ ipad AIR 2 太老了。
局域网远程工具，有哪些，求推荐，最好能跨平台。
硬件的方案
笔记本主板的视频输出是 EDP1.4 40PIN ，如果能转 DP 接口输出也可以的。
BTW ，这个黑苹果无法 HDMI 输出，全球无解。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、背景
近日，微博官方发布了一项新功能，即可以在App设置中动态更换微博的显示图标样式。根据微博官方的说法，除了最原始的图标外，微博还推出了另外10种不同的样式，既有3D微博、炫彩微博等保留了眼睛造型的新样式，也有奶酪甜馨、巧克力等以食物命名的“新口味”，还有梦幻紫、幻想星空等抽象派新造型，给了微博用户多种选择的自由。
不过需要注意的是，这一功能并不是面对所有人开放的，只有微博年费会员才能享受。此外，iOS 10.3及以上和Android 10及以上系统版本支持该功能，但是iPad与一加8Pro手机无法使用该功能。因部分手机存在系统差异，会导致该功能不可用，微博方面后续还会对该功能进行进一步优化。

二、技术实现
其实，说到底，上述功能用到的是动态更换桌面图标的技术。如果说多年以前，实现图标的切换还是一种时髦的技术，那么，我们可以直接使用PackageManager就可以实现动态更换桌面图标。
实现的细节是，在Manifest文件中使用标签准备多个Activity入口，没个activity都指向入口Activity，并且为每个拥有标签的activity设置单独的icon和应用名，最后调用SystemService 服务kill掉launcher，并执行launcher的重启操作。
首先，我们在AndroidManifest.xml文件中添加如下代码：


    
    
    
    
    
         
       ...//省略其他代码

以 Belkin 的为例，Belkin 的雷电 4 比雷电 3 的多了
90W PD （雷电 3 的是 85W ）
下行 USB-C 口支持 20W 快充
多了个 10Gbps 的 USB-A 口（雷电 3 的只有一个）
一个 DP1.4 的口换成了俩 HDMI 2.0 口
在京东 Belkin 官方店里，雷电 4 的扩展坞比雷电 3 的贵了 1000 块（ 2498 -> 3499 ）。我看 Caldigit ts4 比 ts3+多的也差不多，而且这俩牌子的雷电 4 扩展坞还没在苹果官方商店上架。
从带宽上看雷电 4 的总带宽比雷电 3 也没变化，只是多了动态分配的功能（可以多接几个 10Gbps 外置硬盘？），但雷电 4 扩展坞价格却高了不少，更何况市场上流通的二手雷电 3 产品还能进一步压低价格。虽然大家都说买新不买旧，但考虑到这个价格差，还是雷电 3 扩展坞更合适吧？]]></summary>

自从低欲望躺平以来，确实感觉富足了不少。
但最近各类事件让我心理还是阴暗到极点，有些早已养成的想法、三观，现在也崩塌的只剩破砖烂瓦。
有些东西明明不合理，但是它就是发生了，看着它发生，也没半点办法。
有人劝，又不关你的事，再说你也管不了。
是的，我也知道，所以我感到烦躁。
这就是“负能量”吧。
有时半夜突然就发狠，不如偷渡出门。到另一个地方生活着同样的生活，或者更差，可至少心理负担就可以搁下，也不必再对自己生活的社会抱有什么幻想。
一个朋友说，生活就是这样的，你总不会想生出来就享福吧？我认为这是混账话，却又不知道怎么去辩驳。
天气预报一直提示最近有雨，我在等着它，可它却一直没来。
空气里混杂着尾气和尘土，我感觉不到难受。
只是很久没有闻到雨点砸在地上，掀起的泥土香了。

spice 的客户端是 win10, 4k 60hz 的显示器，spice 的两端在同一个局域网下

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解由我们生活中的所有连接设备组成的网络。




在早期，计算机既笨重又昂贵，计算机用户很少，他们必须在计算机上的预留时间内亲自来处理他们的打孔卡punchcard。被称为 大型机Mainframe 的系统进行了许多创新，并在终端机terminal（没有自己的 CPU 的桌面计算机）上实现了分时time-shared任务。

时至今日，强大的计算设备能做到 价格低至 35 美元，且大小不超过一张信用卡。这甚至还没有涵盖现代生活中负责收集和处理数据的所有小设备。从高层次的角度来看这些计算机的集合，你可以想象得到，所有这些设备多得像云中的水滴一样。

碰巧“云计算cloud computing”一词已经被占用，因此需要为由物联网（IoT）和其他具有战略意义的服务器组成的网络提供一个独特的名称。此外，如果已经有一个代表数据中心节点的云，那么在云之外与我们交融的这些节点肯定有其独特之处。

欢迎来到雾计算

云通过互联网提供计算服务。构成云的数据中心很大，但与潜在客户的数量相比相对较少。这表明当数据在云及其众多用户之间来回传送时存在潜在的瓶颈。

相比之下，雾计算Fog Computing可以在数量上超过其潜在客户，而不会出现瓶颈，因为设备执行大部分数据的收集或计算。它是云的外部“边缘”，是云落地的部分。

雾和边缘计算

雾计算和 边缘计算edge computing 本质上是同义词。两者都与云和物联网密切相关，并做出相同的架构假设：


你离 CPU 越近，数据传输就越快。

像 Linux 一样，小型专用计算机，可以“做一件事并把它做好”，这是一个强大的优势（当然，我们的设备实际上不仅仅做一件事，但从高层次上看，你购买的用于监测健康的智能手表本质上是在做“一”件事）。

离线是不可避免的，但好的设备可以在此期间同样有效地运行，然后在重新连接时同步。

本地设备能比大型数据中心更简单、更便宜。


边缘网络

将雾计算视为与云完全分离的实体很诱人，但它们毕竟是组成一个整体的两个部分。云需要数字企业的基础设施，包括公共云提供商、电信公司，甚至是运行自己服务的专业公司。本地化服务也很重要，可以在云核心与其数以百万计的客户之间提供中转站waystations。

雾计算位于云的边缘，无论客户身在何处，都与他们紧密联系在一起。有时这是一个消费环境，例如你自己的家或汽车，而另一些时候这是一种商业利益，例如零售店中的价格监控设备或工厂车间的重要的安全传感器。

雾计算就在你身边

雾计算由我们生活中的所有连接设备组成：无人机drone、电话、手表、健身监视器、安全监视器、家庭自动化、便携式游戏设备、园艺自动化、天气传感器、空气质量监视器等等。理想情况下，它提供的数据有助于建立一个更好、更明智的未来。有许多伟大的开源项目正朝着改善健康的方向而努力 —— 甚至只是让生活变得更有趣一点儿 —— 这一切都得益于雾和云计算。无论如何，我们的 工作是确保它 保持开放。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无服务器计算将服务器从规划中移除，使企业能够专注于应用功能。那么，企业是不是都应该选择无服务器计算呢？让我们来探究一下吧！




直至不久之前，几乎每个产品经理都会将他/她的工程资源，分成两个独立的团队 —— 开发团队和运维团队。开发团队通常参与编码、测试和构建应用功能，而运维团队负责应用程序的交付、部署和运行维护。

当开发团队构建电商应用时，运维团队会搭建好服务器来托管该应用。搭建服务器涉及到许多方面，其中包括：


选择合适的硬件和操作系统

应用所需的补丁集

搭建所需服务器环境，如 JDK、Python、Tomcat、NodeJS 等

部署、配置和提供实际的应用

打开并固定合适的端口

搭建所需的数据库引擎


……这个名单还在继续。

除此之外，管理人员还对容量规划感到头疼。毕竟，任何重要应用都应始终保持 100% 可用、可靠且可扩展。这需要对硬件进行最佳投资。众所周知，在一些关键时期，硬件短缺会导致业务损失，而硬件冗余又会损害利润。因此，无论应用是针对本地数据中心，还是针对云基础架构，容量规划都是至关重要的。到目前为止，很明显，企业不仅在功能构建上投入了大量的精力，还在功能交付上也花费了大量的时间。

无服务器计算Serverless computing旨在提供一种无缝的方式来交付功能，而无需担心服务器的设置和维护。换句话说，无服务器计算平台提供了一个“即用型ready-to-use”环境，企业可以尽快将应用程序构建和部署为一些较小的功能。这就是为什么这种方法被称为“功能即服务Function as a Service”（FaaS）。

请记住，无服务器计算中仍然存在服务器，但它由 AWS、微软和谷歌等 FaaS 供应商负责。

例如，AWS 以 “Lambda 函数”的形式提供了一个无服务器计算环境。开发人员可以选择将…]]></summary>

A former Apple lawyer who was in charge of preventing insider trading has pleaded guilty to six counts of securities fraud for insider trading, according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) press release. Gene Levoff, once the company’s former corporate secretary and director of corporate law, “misappropriated material, nonpublic information about Apple’s financial results and then executed trades involving the company’s stock” from February 2011 to April 2016, the release says. Charges against him were initially filed by the SEC as a civil complaint in 2019.
Levoff also served on Apple’s Disclosure Committee, a group that looked over company earnings reports and SEC filings before they were published. Using information he was privy to, he...

Today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted SpaceX authorization to use its Starlink satellite internet system on vehicles in motion — including cars, trucks, boats, and aircraft. It’s a big win for SpaceX’s Starlink system, potentially opening up the service to a more diverse range of use cases and customers.
SpaceX requested regulatory approval from the FCC in March of last year to allow Earth Stations in Motion (ESIM) Starlink terminals to be used in moving vehicles. To tap into the system and receive broadband internet coverage, customers must purchase a personal ground-based antenna, or user terminal, that is designed to connect with any orbiting Starlink satellites that happen to be overhead. Up until now, those...

Months after General Motors started delivering its first Hummer EVs, the company is reportedly only producing around 12 of the massive electric trucks a day, according to The Wall Street Journal. That’s an abysmally slow pace, even compared to how many electric trucks other automakers are making: the Journal says Ford’s producing around 150 F-150 Lightings a day, whereas Rivian’s Q1 production numbers indicate it’s making somewhere between 30 and 40 EVs a day (Rivian didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for more specific numbers).
Recently, GM announced that it was raising the Hummer EV’s price by $6,250, citing “higher prices for parts, technology and logistics,” according to CNBC.

Bitcoin miners in New York state faced a regulatory blow today as the state denied air permits for a gas-fired power plant used to mine Bitcoin. It’s the latest step that New York has taken to crack down on crypto mining as it tries to meet its goals on climate change.
The decision was made for the Greenidge Generating Station in New York’s Finger Lakes region. Bitcoin mining brought new life and renewed controversy to the embattled plant in 2020. That drew outrage from some local residents worried about how the plant could affect fish and tourism by discharging hot water into nearby Seneca Lake. At the state level, Greenidge’s revival has sparked fears that pollution from the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin could revive other...

T-Mobile has announced that its 5G home internet service is now available in more cities, spanning parts of Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, and Kansas. The service now covers more than 40 million homes, and earlier this spring, the company said it signed up its one-millionth customer. That’s good news in our landscape of cable internet provider monopolies, but T-Mobile has some real work to do if it plans to meet its goal of 7 to 8 million customers by 2025.
Providing fixed wireless internet to a broad portion of the nation was a big selling point in T-Mobile’s case to the FCC when it argued to be allowed to acquire Sprint. The gist of the whole deal was that we’d lose one of our four wireless carriers temporarily while T-Mobile...

Update 6/30/2022: The Supreme Court ruling in West Virginia v. Environmental protection agency came out today, limiting the agency’s ability to regulate power plant emissions. Read the ruling and dissent here, and read more about what the ruling means for climate action here. Our original article continues below. 
This week, the Supreme Court is expected to decide a major climate case that could determine what tools the federal government can use to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
The case, West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, started out years ago as a battle over how much authority the EPA has to force power plants to cut down their pollution — but it’s turned into a bigger fight over how much power federal agencies have to...

The Supreme Court just gutted a major policy tool the US might have used to tackle climate change. Its decision today on West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency essentially says that the EPA shouldn’t be allowed to determine whether the US gets its electricity from clean or dirty sources of energy.
That derails previous efforts by the agency to transition the US away from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like wind and solar by regulating the power sector. With the new decision, the agency might be able to push a power plant to install technology to reduce its emissions on-site, but it can’t influence states’ decisions on where they get their energy from in the first place. To make things worse, the premise of the court’s...

🏀DataBinding只是一种工具，用来解决View和数据之间的绑定。
Data Binding，顾名思义：数据绑定，它可以将布局页面中的组件和应用中的数据进行绑定，支持单向绑定和双向绑定，单向绑定就是如果数据有变化就会驱动页面进行变化，双向绑定就是除了单向绑定之外还支持页面的变化驱动数据的变化，如果页面中有一个输入框，那么我们就可以进行双向绑定，数据变化，它的显示内容就变了，我们手动输入内容也可以改变绑定它的数据。
🌟官方文档：https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/androidx/releases/databinding
🌟官方Demo地址：https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-databinding
本文代码地址
如何使用DataBinding呢？
1.启用DataBinding
引用官方文档：
Databinding与 Android Gradle 插件捆绑在一起。您无需声明对此库的依赖项，但必须启用它。
☀注意：即使模块不直接使用数据绑定，也必须为依赖于使用数据绑定的库的所有模块启用数据绑定。
//在gradle的android下加入，然后点击sync
android {
    ...
    //android studio 4.0以下
    dataBinding{
    
    }
    //android studio4.1以后
    buildFeatures {
        dataBinding true
    }
}

2.生成DataBinding布局
在我们的布局文件中，选择根目录的View，按下Alt+回车键，点击Convert to data binding layout，就可以转换为DataBinding布局啦。…]]></summary>

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
Implement the Trie class:
Trie() Initializes the trie object.
Here is my different solution:
class Trie(object):

Being QA to me means that you need to become a quality advocate, in short, that means the following things:
Observe,
Analyze,
Conclude,
and the most important thing is to SPEAK UP, pretty often I have witnessed a situation when joining a new team where current QA members were concerned about things within the project but didn’t raise them because they weren’t feeling confident and knowledgeable enough, my advice here is trivial, be brave, you are the main source of raising red flags within the project, your input is the most important part of risk management.

The article was very detailed, and contained a lot of code examples, but we got some feedback from many developers that it would be helpful to get a boilerplate project that will save more time on bootstrapping a new project. 
Well, your prayer was heard, and today we're happy to launch the official Common Ninja Starter Kit for NodeJS & ReactJS developers.
The project is available in the link below 👇🏻, and you can follow the main README.md file to see how it works:

Developers of apps released in Apple’s South Korean App Store no longer have to use the company’s own in-app payment system, the iPhone maker has announced in a developer update. Instead, developers will be able to take payments using the third-party service providers pre-approved by Apple.
The change comes in response to an amendment to South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act passed last year, which prevents large platform holders like Apple and Google from forcing developers to use their first-party in-app payment systems. Both Apple and Google opposed the legislation, with Apple arguing that it would make it harder for its users to manage their purchases, undermine their privacy protections, and put them at risk of fraud.

在内核社区有人 建议 在更多范围内使用-O3 编译优化参数后，Linus Torvalds 迅速 驳斥 了这一想法，因为在他看来，这带来的潜在问题更多。Phoronix 使用其著名的测试套件对 -O3 编译的内核性能进行了测试。结论是：在 230 项测试中，-O3 内核的性能只领先了 1.3%，仅在压力测试软件 Stress-NG 的上下文切换基准中有近三倍的提升，一些数据库场景有 10% 左右的提升，其它场景仅有 2% 左右的变化。总体来说，考虑到 -O3 带来的过度优化的潜在风险，使用这个优化参数没什么意义。

Firefox 102 现在可以自动删除 URL 中的跟踪器

这项名为“查询参数剥离”的新功能，可以在你点击一个链接时自动删除 URL 中的跟踪参数。很多网站会在 URL 中附加特定的查询字符串来跟踪链接访问，比如 Facebook 使用的是 fbclid= 。Mozilla 大约在一年前开始研究这一功能，现在它已经准备好供公众使用。这项新功能是严格跟踪保护规则的一部分，但默认情况下是禁用的，因为有可能会破坏正常浏览体验。

老王点评：看得出来，虽然 Firefox 有种种不尽如人意之处，但是对用户隐私的保护真是竭尽全力了。




欧美大范围的路由器受到了新的、异常复杂的恶意软件的攻击

安全研究人员报告说，一个异常先进的黑客组织花了近两年时间，用恶意软件感染了北美和欧洲的各种路由器，完全控制了与路由器连接的 Windows、macOS 和 Linux 设备。他们已经发现至少有 80 个目标被这种隐秘的恶意软件感染，感染的路由器包括思科、Netgear、华硕等制造的设备。它能够列举所有连接到受感染的路由器的设备，并收集它们发送和接收的 DNS 查询和网络流量，并保持不被发现。

老王点评：这是专门针对小型办公室和家庭办公室路由器编译的定制恶意软件，背后所图甚大。]]></summary>

The Biden administration announced a $1 billion effort to rectify racist infrastructure decisions of the past, such as highways that were built by bulldozing Black communities. 
The program, which the Department of Transportation is calling “Reconnecting Communities,” will in some cases tear down highways that were built with the expressed purpose of creating physical barriers between mostly Black and minority communities. Other projects will focus on building new infrastructure, like greenways to promote cycling and walking or transit programs, like rapid bus lines to reconnect communities to urban cores.

Samsung has started producing 3nm chips, beating rival chip manufacturer TSMC to the more power efficient fabrication process, Bloomberg reports. TSMC’s 3nm process isn’t expected to go into mass production until the second half of 2022. 
Samsung says the new fabrication process is 45 percent more power efficient than its previous 5nm process, has 23 percent higher performance, and 16 percent smaller surface area. In the future, it hopes its second generation 3nm process can reduce power consumption and size by 50 percent and 35 percent respectively, and increase performance by 30 percent.
The announcement is a key milestone in Samsung’s efforts to compete with TSMC, which dominates the market for contract chip production and is the...

I recently created the website for my book "The Art of Micro Frontends". For this page I took a rather conservative approach - making a "true" single page (i.e., landing page) that should be as approachable and fast as possible - without sacrificing developer experience.
Surely, there are right now quite some frameworks and tools out there. But I did not want to spent countless hours learning new stuff just to be blocked by some framework restrictions. Instead, I've chosen an approach that - in my opinion - is quite convenient, super fast, and very lightweight.
I've chosen to use react as library for writing reusable components. In a nutshell, for the page it allows me to have code like the following:

在 ssh 1 用docker run -t --rm ubuntu:20.04启动命令，没有加-i，此时输入任何内容都像进入了黑洞一样。
然后 ssh 2 用docker inspect 容器 ID | grep Pid查出来的 pid 是 28160 ，此时往/proc/28160/fd/0、/proc/28160/fd/1、/proc/28160/fd/2三个 fd 写数据，ssh 1 都可以收到并且回显。
从我对-i参数的描述来看，没有加-i所以容器的标准输入没有和当前终端连上，所以只能看到容器的输出，无法输入，但是这个时候在 ssh 2 上的输入都跑哪里去了呢？这个找了好久，报错当前 ssh 的 pst 设备去找也没能读到。]]></summary>

rt, NAS 是群晖 DS216+ii, 千兆网络.

windows 直连 nas 的情况下可以跑满千兆带宽, 下载速度 100M/s 左右
iPad 在 wifi 下使用的 infuse 的 smb 协议连接 nas 的情况下大概 30M+/s, 播放蓝光原盘有些卡
使用 NFS 最快只有 10M/s 的速度, 很多人都说使用 NFS 速度比 smb 快, 这个速度不知道有什么问题.
使用 upnp 速度能达到 70M+/s, 但是有很多电影显示不出来.  infuse 也不显示海报.

SharedPreferences.edit扩展方法
先看下以前我们怎么往SharedPreferences写入值的：

    val edit = sp.edit()
    edit.putString("key", "value");
    edit.apply()

有点小麻烦，所以core-ktx提供了SharedPreferences.edit扩展方法：

然后就可以这样使用：
private fun test1() {
    getSharedPreferences("data", Context.MODE_PRIVATE).edit(false) { 
        putString("key", "value")
    }

When you install an application, you're usually installing a package that contains the executable code for an application and important files such as documentation, icons, and so on. On Linux, applications are commonly packaged as RPM or DEB files, and users install them with the dnf or apt commands, depending on the Linux distribution. However, new Python modules are released virtually every day, so you could easily encounter a module that hasn't yet been packaged. And that's exactly why the pyp2rpm command exists.
Recently, I tried to install a module called python-concentration. It didn't go well:
$ sudo dnf install python-concentration

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[rustup 可用于 Rust 安装与更新。它还能够在稳定版、测试版和每日更新版之间无缝切换 Rust 编译器及其工具。


Rust 编程语言 如今变得越来越流行，受到爱好者和公司的一致好评。它受欢迎的原因之一是 Rust 提供的令人惊叹的工具，使其成为开发人员使用的乐趣。rustup 是管理 Rust 工具的官方工具。它不仅可以安装和更新 Rust ，它还能够在稳定版、测试版和每日更新版之间无缝切换 Rust 编译器及其工具。本文将向你介绍 rustup 及其一些常用命令。

默认 Rust 安装方式

如果你想在 Linux 上安装 Rust，你可以使用你的包管理器。在 Fedora 或 CentOS Stream 上，你可以这样：

$ sudo dnf install rust cargo


这提供了一个稳定版的 Rust 工具链，如果你是 Rust 的初学者，并想尝试编译和运行简单的程序，它会非常有用。但是，由于 Rust 是一种新的编程语言，它变化很快，并且经常添加许多新功能。这些功能是 Rust 工具链的每日更新版和之后测试版的一部分。要试用这些功能，你需要安装这些较新版本的工具链，而不会影响系统上的稳定版本。不幸的是，你的发行版的包管理器在这里无法做到。

使用 rustup 安装 Rust 工具链

要解决上述问题，你可以下载安装脚本：

$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \
    -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs > sh.rustup.rs


检查它，然后运行它。它不需要 root 权限，并根据你的本地用户权限安装 Rust：

$ file sh.rustup.rs
sh.rustup.rs: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
$ less sh.rustup.rs
$ bash sh.rustup.rs


出现提示时选择选项 1：

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
> 1


安装后，你必须获取环境变量以确保 rustup 命令立即可供你运行：

$ source $HOME/.cargo/env


验证是否安装了 Rust 编译器（rustc）和 Rust 包管理器（cargo）：

$ rustc --version
$ cargo --version


查看已安装和可用的工具链

你可以使用以下命令查看已安装的不同工具链以及哪个工具链是可用的：

$ rustup show


在工具链之间切换

你可以查看默认工具链并根据需要进行更改。如果你当前使用的是稳定版工具链，并希望尝试每日更新版中提供的新功能，你可以轻松切换到每日更新版工具链：

$ rustup default
$ rustup default nightly


要查看 Rust 的编译器和包管理器的完整路径：

$ rustup which rustc
$ rustup which cargo


检查和更新工具链

要检查是否有新的 Rust 工具链可用：

$ rustup check


假设一个新版本的 Rust 发布了，其中包含一些有趣的特性，并且你想要获取最新版本的 Rust。你可以使用 update 子命令来做到这一点：

$ rustup update


帮助和文档

以上命令对于日常使用来说绰绰有余。尽管如此，rustup 有多种命令，你可以参考帮助部分了解更多详细信息：

$ rustup --help


rustup 在 GitHub 上有完整的 参考手册，你可以用作参考。所有 Rust 文档都安装在你的本地系统上，不需要你连接到互联网。你可以访问包括书籍、标准库等在内的本地文档：

$ rustup doc
$ rustup doc --book
$ rustup doc --std
$ rustup doc --cargo


Rust 是一种正在积极开发中的令人兴奋的语言。如果你对编程的发展方向感兴趣，请关注 Rust！

电信收费方式太过复杂，其中的每个环节的收费项跟最终在系统查询到的业务名还不对应

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[yeyang5211: 由于我是半路接受 es 的开发工作,对整体的技术工具方案都不是很了解.
接手半年发现自己一直在做 ETL 相关的工作.
现有的方案是 : 
1.接受数据变更 MQ 消息
2.去 MySql 查询业务数据组装成 JSON
3.合并更新 MongoDB 中..
4.跑批更新到 ES 中(一个比较复杂的树形结构)

现有的问题 :
1.跑批任务经常卡死,不可靠
2.业务变动,总是需要我去开发 java 代码

我寻思 ES 这块应该有工具的,所以我去查了一下 Kettle 应该符合我的要求.
设想是跑批任务定时拉去 Mysql 拉去业务表的变动,然后通过一系列的转换流程补充成完整的业务 JSON(多张数据表组装成 JSON),在更新到 es 中(省了 MongoDB 这步)
询问了下我们公司的数仓同事,他们也在用阿里云的 DataWorks 工具.我研究了下发现这个工具只能做简单的同步数据映射,达到我设想的多张表聚合成一个 JSON 貌似要使用 EMR 引擎,我对这块特别不熟悉.完全没有头绪感觉 EMR(我理解为大数据相关的工具)学习成本太高了..


总结一下想了解的问题:
1.如果有其他方案,请不吝赐教
2.麻烦帮我权衡一下使用 Kettle 还是 DataWorks(二个都不会用,不是很想学大数据相关的技术 纯门外汉)
考虑 DataWorks 的原因是我们公司喜欢上云服务,减轻运维压力]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是如何在 elementary OS 中启用最小化、最大化窗口按钮的方法。


许多人（大多数是 elementary OS 的新用户）在各种论坛上问这些问题：


我怎样才能在 elementary OS 中启用最小化按钮？

我如何启用还原、最小化、最大化？

有可能恢复最小化和最大化按钮吗？


这些都是完全正常的问题，而且问问题也是可以的。对吧？这篇指南可以帮助他们在 elementary OS 中获得这些按钮。

Elementary OS 所使用的 Pantheon 桌面并没有默认的标准窗口按钮。其主要原因是通过 Dock 和应用菜单处理用户行为和活动的不同理念。可以说，这种设计或实现的行为模仿了macOS。

不过，许多用户更喜欢窗口按钮，因为这是一个所谓的“肌肉记忆”，而且有些人是从其他桌面环境（甚至是 Windows）迁移过来的。

尽管 Elementary 没有为你提供这个默认设置，你仍然可以启用它。下面是方法。

启用最小化最大化按钮 - elementary OS

打开终端，安装添加 PPA 所需的 software-properties-common 软件包。默认情况下，这个包在 elementary OS 中没有安装（不要问我为什么，真的）。

sudo apt install software-properties-common


elementary OS 6 Odin

elementary Tweak 工具被重新换了个名字，它现在被称为 Pantheon Tweaks，并正在单独开发中。使用以下命令，你可以安装它：

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/pantheon-tweaks
sudo apt install -y pantheon-tweaks


elementary OS 5 Juno 及更低版本

如果你使用的是 elementary OS 5 June 及更低版本，你可以使用相同的 PPA 安装早期的 elementary-tweaks。在终端按照以下命令进行操作：

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/elementary-tweaks
sudo apt install -y elementary-tweaks


更改设置



安装后，点击顶部栏的“应用Application”，打开“系统设置System settings”。在系统设置窗口中，点击“个人Personal”下的 “Tweaks”。



在 Tweaks 窗口中，进入“外观Appearance”。



在窗口控制下，选择布局：“Windows”。





然后在顶部窗口栏的右侧应该有最小化、最大化和关闭按钮了。



也有其他组合形式，如 Ubuntu、macOS 等。你可以选择任何你觉得合适的：



这篇指南至此就结束了。系统设置中还有其他选项，你可以尝试使用，但窗口管理器 gala 最近删除了这些选项。因此，它们目前可能无法工作。

我希望这个指南能帮助你启用 elementary OS 的最小化最大化按钮。如果你需要任何帮助，请在下面的评论栏告诉我。

与专有操作系统相比，我很欣赏 Linux 的一个特点是，几乎所有的东西都可以从命令行中进行管理和配置。意味着几乎所有的事情都可以在本地或者通过 SSH 远程登录进行管理。虽然有时候需要花费一点时间在互联网上搜索，但是你能想到的任务，是有可能从命令行完成的。

问题

有时候需要使用命令行对桌面进行远程配置。在这种特殊情况下，我需要响应远程用户的请求将在 Xfce 控制板上的工作区从四个减少到三个。这种配置只需要在互联网上搜索约 20 分钟就找到了。

xfwm4 的默认工作区数量和许多其他设置可以在 /usr/share/xfwm4/defaults 这个文件中找到和修改。因此将 workspace_count=2 设置为 workspace_count=4 就改变了主机上所有用户的默认值。同时，非 root 用户可以执行 xfconf-query 命令来查询和设置 xfwm4 窗口管理器的各种属性。它应该由需要改变设置的用户使用，而不是由 root 使用。

在下面的例子中，首先我验证了当前工作区数量为 4 ，然后将数量改为 2，最后确认了新设置。

[user@test1 ~]# xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/workspace_count
4
[user@test1 ~]# xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/workspace_count -s 2
[user@test1 ~]# xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/workspace_count
2
[user@test1 ~]#


此更改会立即生效，用户可以马上看到，无需重新启动，甚至无需注…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[喜欢就是生产力，这是昨天飞书玩家大会的 Slogan，我也在视频里分享了一段少数派的小故事，有兴趣的朋友可以去看看回放。我个人很喜欢这句话，顺便分享一点想法。
我个人的成长经历就印证了这句话，无论是学历（大专）、专业（中医）、背景（贸易），都跟我过去十年做的事情无关（科技、内容、互联网），能走到如今这一步，全是因为喜欢。
这个喜欢可以分为两部分，一个是喜欢基于文字的表达，也就是写作。不管是小学写作文，还是中学写情书，到工作后写总结报告，我都能从写作中找到愉悦和成就。而这个能力，帮我跨越了专业和背景，获得老师的关注，俘获芳心，在职场中快速晋升，包括说服投资人支持我创业，你说这算不算生产力。
另一部分，是对电子科技的喜欢，当然这可能是大部分男孩的天性。中学的时候，家里搞电器维修，留下一堆破烂零件，我就利用他们打造自己的「人工」智能家居系统，有各种发光二极管+闪光器构建的氛围灯，还有隐藏各处的喇叭，打造虚拟立体声音响。那时候就畅想过智能家居、无线互联等各种的梦幻场景，今天全都实现了，我也没有被淘汰，乐在其中。
这两个喜欢结合在一块，有了我的第一个烧麦博客，第一个煮机社区，以及今天的少数派。我们一直在发现和聚拢那些真正喜欢的人，一起创造价值，而不是过于关注他们的专业和背景。
这个理念也融合到团队的组建和管理当中，每一个成员加入公司的时候，我都会更关注他对少数派的认知，对自己领域的喜爱程度。如果没有这个基础，我们可能会付出大量的管理和沟通成本，还会带来更多的误会和不悦。
渐渐的，从广大的作者中筛选团队成员就成了最佳模式，这其中不乏清北名校、一线大厂的优秀人才，他们放弃更加稳定和优渥的条件，选择从事自己喜欢的事情，创造更多可见的价值。没有了传统公司的条条框框，更好的释放自身潜能。尽管聚散无常，不管未来走向何处，他们带着的是自己的实战能力，而不是所谓的辉煌履历。
朋友在一家上市公司当主管，有完备的薪资和股权奖励体系，他却经常跟我抱怨年轻人想法多，离职率很高，而每一个新员工，都要花大量的时间重新建立信任，接手工作。然后又不知道哪一天突然提出离职。

而另一方面，我们同一楼层的游戏公司老板，正在参考少数派办公室的风格，筹划着给团队成员配上升降桌，工学椅，更换有设计感的桌面设备，这些被忽略的细枝末节，却能构建创意氛围，激发团队成员的创造力。
如今，创业浪潮已过，泡沫退去，一地狼藉。而最终留下来的创业公司，都应该思考自己的企业文化和管理模式，所谓的强势管理驱动，已经不适合这一代年轻人，更不适合创意型企业。用喜欢驱动，才是可持续的生产力。]]></summary>

Substack is the latest tech company to announce layoffs, with the company’s CEO Chris Best tweeting on Wednesday that he’s letting 13 workers go. According to Axios, that’s around 14 percent of Substack’s workforce. In his letter and follow-up tweets, Best cites “market conditions” as the reason behind the layoffs.
He also admits that the move may be a surprise to some employees. “Not so long ago, I told you all that our plan was to grow the team and not do layoffs,” he says, also noting that the company is “still hiring for specific key roles” and has money saved. However, Best says that the company needs to change tactics, as it could be facing “an extended period” where the economy goes from bad to worse. He says that the layoffs are...

Flutter 帧的阶段
Flutter 把一帧分为了 6 个阶段，每个阶段做不同的事情，并且把帧阶段包装在枚举类 SchedulerPhase 中，作为前期准备，我们认识一下这个类和这几个阶段是啥。
idle —— 空闲
这个阶段没有帧任务执行，在这个阶段执行的代码是：SchedulerBinding.scheduleTask 发布的 TaskCallback 、scheduleMicrotask 注册的微任务、Timer 声明的任务、用户的手势处理器、Future 和 Stream 的任务。
这里大家需要先看一下 Dart 的任务执行顺序，这个链接需要翻墙哦～，了解一下 Dart 是如何处理事件队列、微任务队列的，以便我们写出更好的异步代码。
transientCallbacks —— 瞬时任务阶段
这个阶段执行 SchedulerBinding.scheduleFrameCallback 添加的回调，一般情况下，这些回调执行动画有关的计算，我们在前面的动画介绍中，讲过这个地方，👉
Flutter 动画是这么动起来的

transientCallbacks 也会产生一些微任务，这些微任务会在这个阶段…]]></summary>

One thing I have come to appreciate is that cryptocurrency isn’t really very good at its killer use case: crime. Today’s example comes from North Korea, where the regime’s war chest of stolen cryptocurrency is suddenly worth a lot less than it used to be.
Here’s an exceptionally funny sentence from Reuters: 
Old, unlaundered North Korean crypto holdings monitored by the New York-based blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which include funds stolen in 49 hacks from 2017 to 2021, have decreased in value from $170 million to $65 million since the beginning of the year, the company told Reuters.

That’s a 61 percent loss, overall, for those of you keeping track at home. The crypto from one 2021 heist has lost at least 80 percent of its...

Niantic, which has been trying to replicate the massive success of Pokémon Go with other mobile AR games, is laying off 8 percent of its workforce and canceling four projects, as reported by Bloomberg. 
“We recently decided to stop production on some projects and reduce our workforce by about eight percent to focus on our key priorities,” Niantic VP of communications Jonny Thaw said in a statement to The Verge. “We are grateful for the contributions of those leaving Niantic and we are supporting them through this difficult transition.

Foxx teased the new film, titled Back in Action, in a tweet containing an audio call between him, Diaz, and Tom Brady, whose retirement from football notably lasted a whole 40 days.
In a press release, Netflix doesn’t reveal much about the upcoming film other than that it’s an action-comedy directed, produced, and written by Seth Gordon, the director behind Horrible Bosses. Beau Bauman of Central Intelligence will serve as a producer, and Neighbors’ Brendan O’Brien is helping out with the script. Netflix says the premise of the film will remain “under wraps”...

From the Instagram home screen, tap your profile icon, followed by the menu icon in the top right.
Select Settings > Account > Sharing to other apps.

Select the account you want to link and enter your login information. You can link a number of networks, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. (If you’re linking to...

If you were worried that the real-life foam firing version of the infamous Gjallarhorn rocket launcher from Destiny would be disappointingly kid-sized, you can put those fears to rest: Bungie has just revealed what an actual blaster looks like — and when fans can get it. 
Preorders for the over 4-foot-long, 1:1 scale blaster will begin July 7th at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, and existing Gjallarhorn owners get dibs.

背景
我们工程中使用的AGP是4.0.2版本，在去年升级的，目前最新版本是AGP7.2.1，已经落后官方5个大版本了
gradle升级是必然的，只是时候未到而已。同时在去年也进行了AGP7.0升级调研，由于种种原因，按下了暂停键。但是这不妨碍我们与时俱进，去学习新的知识。

今天给大家介绍我们未来会使用到的一个新特性，先看下面这张图

从 AGP1.5 一直存在的Transform API在AGP7.0被标记为废弃了，AGP8.0会直接移除掉，连AGP中最稳定的Transform API都被废弃了，所以技术的更新迭代，没有什么是不可能的，只有变化才能适用发展
根据Google的计划AGP8.0在今年年中就会正式发布
什么是Transform
已经2022年了，作为一名Android工程师，我相信大家都知道Transform是什么，如果有人不知道，也没关系，因为Transform已经快过时了，按照惯例，这里我还是要介绍一下Transform

AGP包含了一个Transform API, 它允许第三方插件在编译后的class文件转换为dex文件之前做处理操作. 而使用Transform API, 我们完全可以不用去关注相关task的生成与执行流程, 它让我们可以只聚焦在如何对输入的class文件进行处理
工作时机 ：Transform 工作在 Android 构建中由 Class → Dex 的节点
处理对象： 处理对象包括 Javac 编译后的 Class 文件、Java 标准 resource 资源、本地依赖和远程依赖的 JAR/AAR
Transform Task： 每个 Transform 都对应一个 Task，Transform 的输入和输出可以理解为对应 Transfor…]]></summary>

在上一篇文章《FlutterWeb开发进出坑总结》中说到，“用静态路由的方式跳转，全局变量，单例对象丢失，页面栈记录丢失。”，那本文就是介绍一下页面栈记录丢失的解决方案。
一、问题
在Flutter开发的网页运行时，浏览器刷新网页后，虽然会显示刷新前的页面（前提是用静态路由跳转），但这时调用Navigator.pop方法是回不到上一页的，包括点击浏览器的回退按钮也是无效的（地址栏中的url会变，页面不会变）。
二、原因
当浏览器刷新时，Flutter引擎会重新启动，并加载当前页面，也就是说，刷新后的Flutter内存中所有静态变量都被初始化，页面栈内之前的页面记录都未保留，只有当前的页面。就像是浏览网页时，把其中一页的网址拷出来，在新的标签页再次打开。
三、解决方案
1. 思路
知道什么原因引起的，就针对性解决。页面栈记录丢失，那么就代码中自己维护一套备用栈，监听页面路由，每次进入新页面时，记录当前页面的URL，当退出时，删除记录的URL，在浏览器刷新栈记录失效时，帮助回退到上一页。
2.方案优缺点
优点： 可实现回退效果无异常，调用Navigator.pop方法或点击浏览器回退按钮都支持；
缺点： Navigator.pushName().then的回调无法生效，因为是重新生成的上一页，所以并不会调用回调；回退后的页面中的临时数据都会消失，比如输入框内的内容，成员变量等；跳转必须用静态路由的方式，并且传参要用Uri包裹，不能用构造函数传参。
四、实现
1. Web本地存储工具—localStorage
localStorage是在html包下window中的一个存储对象，以key、value的形式进行存储

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[导言
这是一个健身知识随处可见的时代。打开短视频应用，许许多多身材健美的博主热情地分享健身的知识；打开小红书，营养和食物的科普永远不会缺乏热度。对于一个追求好身材，或希望拥有健康的身体的普通人来说，学习这些知识当然大有益处。但作为普通人面临的困难常常是：「知识和道理我都懂，但是就是做不到」。所以我想，比知识更重要的，是那些在实践过程中，不断尝试，反复思考，再加上一点点灵感，得到的经验与启发。
所以，我在「健身怪谈」这个系列中，不仅仅分享我所学到的知识（knowledge），更要分享我是如何运用这些知识指导我的实践，并得到了怎样的结果（know-how）。而只有know-how，能帮助到那些了解知识却做不到的朋友，消解他们的困扰。
正文
大多数朋友身材的困扰，大致可以分为两个原因和三种体型。原因可以分为体脂率过高和肌肉量不足，进而造成的困扰是肥胖、瘦弱，以及四肢纤细的同时腹部有脂肪堆积。我自己因为长期久坐，赘肉会在腹部堆积，但同时肌肉量又不足，整个人就成了一个瘦胖子体型。为了让自己有更好的身材和更健康的身体，我的计划是：先增肌，让整个人视觉上看起来健壮；再逐步减脂，让肌肉的线条得以显现。目前处于增肌期间的我，会在这篇文章中，分享我在足量摄入蛋白质方面下的功夫，以及收获的经验。
力量训练对增肌的帮助自然是不言而喻的，但同样重要的是：足量蛋白质的摄取。虽然我们每天吃的食物当中，有相当一部分富含蛋白质，这些分量通常可以满足健康的需求。但当我们需要刻意摄取大量蛋白质以满足肌肉生长的需求的时候，就发现这件事情并没有那么容易。一日三餐能提供的蛋白质，通常是不足够的。剩余的部分，如果通过喝蛋白粉和吃水煮鸡胸肉来填补，或许是一个很有效率的方式，但终究会因为太枯燥而难以持续。我们总还是需要找到一些，在蛋白粉和鸡胸肉之外的方式，既适合健身人群高效地补充蛋白质，又能够满足味蕾，丰富饮食生活。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[慢到让人发狂

公司电脑真心太慢了，作为一台Pentium G3240的主机，它已经服役了近8年。而随着现在软件的不断更新，它现在打开一个WPS文档都要等待几十秒，更不要提在使用WPS的同时还要整天挂着微信和QQ，它承受着这个“年龄”所不应该有的压力。

看着这硕大的机箱，试问它还有升级潜力吗？100元换个主板，50元换个U，80元找个固盘？最后掐指一算，与其让它“复活”，还不如转向MiniPC系列，毕竟我们的需求也只是常态化的办公，编辑一下文档和PPT、播放视频、帮学员网络报名考试而已。而现今的MiniPC已能完美贴合我的需求，并且体积也足够小，能为桌底腾出很大的空间。

作为说干就干的速度派，怀揣着从财务牙齿缝里抠出来的2K元，我打开了某东。好像可选的产品并不算多，其中性能最好的要数华硕的PN41系列，采用了11代奔腾N6005，4G内存，256G存储空间，还附有正版Win11系统。出于一贯对华硕这个品牌的信任，以1K7不到的价格将其入手，还预留了300的空间可以拿来加内存或者固盘。
接下来就是我入手后的开箱与使用体验，希望对各位有意向的小伙伴带来一个参考。

体积0.6L，但依旧强大

华硕PN41所提供的物件倒是比较丰富，除了主机、适配器、电源线以及说明书以外，还附有螺丝钉，脚垫和显示器支架。

主机的尺寸确实够小巧，大概也就115*115mm左右，整体外观方方正正的。0.6L的体积也就一个巴掌的大小，感觉随身携带着也不是不可以。

我没有选择纯白的配色，主要还是考虑到黑色更耐脏。整个机身以金属材质为主，表面还采用了金属拉丝工艺，让其更不容易留下指纹。

尽管华硕PN41的体积不大，但是接口方面倒是绝不缩水。在正面部分包含了USB-A接口、3.5mm频耳机/麦克风二合一孔、USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C端口（10 Gbps）、电源开关键和硬盘指示灯，能满足大…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vim 9.0 发布，带来了百倍速度新脚本语言

Vim 迎来了两年来的首个重大更新，在这个版本中除了若干变化外，还带来了一个新的脚本语言 Vim9 脚本。Vim9 脚本的目标是极大地提升性能，可带来一到两个数量级（10~100 倍）的执行速度提升；其次是避免 Vim 特有的结构，使之更接近于常用的编程语言，如 JavaScript、TypeScript 和 Java 等。不过，虽然 Vim9 和 Vim 之前支持的脚本语言存在一些不兼容，但旧的脚本仍然可以继续工作，不会像 Python 2 那样。


消息来源：Vim



老王点评：虽然是非常古老甚至古怪的编辑器，但是可喜的是 Vim 依然与时俱进，甚至还可能发展出一门通用的脚本语言来！




有人正在使用深度伪造来申请远程工作

美国联邦调查局表示已收到多起投诉，称有人利用窃取的信息和深度伪造的视频和语音来申请远程技术工作。这些视频、图像或录音被篡改成看起来和听起来像别人的，这些伪造者还使用偷来的他人身份信息来申请 IT、编程、数据库和软件公司的工作。不过，一些比较业余的深度伪造技术没有能及时跟上伪造者的咳嗽和打喷嚏，因而出现了一些穿帮镜头。目前还不清楚在这些虚假的工作尝试中，有多少是成功的，有多少是被发现并被举报的。


消息来源：gizmodo



老王点评：这真是新技术的“新用途”，这些远程工作者盯上的不只是公司的薪水，可能还有公司的机密信息。




Asahi Linux 开始着手为 M2 带来 Linux 支持

Asahi Linux 一直在努力将“苹果硅”芯片支持拉入 Linux 生态。最近他们收到了一台 13 英寸的 2022 款 MacBook Pro，开始着手为 M2 带来 Linux 支持。幸运的是，为 M1 编写的大部分 Linux 代码，都可在 M2 上无缝运行。当然，要让 M2 Mac 完美运行 Linux，还得再编写一些新的驱动程序。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：光靠着开源社区反向工程做到这个程度已属难得，而这个过程中，苹果公司就静静的看着。]]></summary>

In this case, I will take you through how to set up and use environment variables inside your Flutter apps to keep your secret data safe. I will show a couple of solutions, one without any external packages, and one using the dotenv package. I will also show you how to handle different environments (e.g. stage, sandbox, prod, etc...)
The problem
Solution #1 (no dotenv)
1. Create env files
3. Add .env to pubspec.yml assets
5. Create an Env class
6. Initialize dotenv

7. We're all setup
2. Replacing .env with the correct env
5. Building app
Summary
But first, let's take a look at the problem we're trying to solve:

Hyundai is offering an early look at its upcoming all-electric sedan, the Ioniq 6. It comes as Bloomberg reports that the company’s EV market share is quietly surging in Europe and the US, causing even Tesla’s Elon Musk to take notice.
If last year’s all-electric Ioniq 5 crossover SUV took inspiration from 70s designs, then Top Gear says that the 6 draws inspiration from streamlined vehicles from the 20s and 30s like the Stout Scarab. If you liked the look of Hyundai’s Prophecy concept car from 2020, then the Ioniq 6 is the vehicle it’s morphed into.
The South Korean automaker is focused on showing off the design of the Ioniq 6 rather than its technical specifications for now, so there are no firm details on its battery size or range....

印尼最大的铁路应用和安全系统提供商 PTLen Industri (Persero)及其子公司 PTLen Railway Systems (LRS) 已成功升级印尼的西爪哇芝卡朗-奇坎佩克 (Cikarang-Cikampek) 铁路服务的信号和电信系统，以符合当前和新兴的安全标准。
“铁路行业是亚太地区许多经济体和企业的关键血脉。 印尼也在建设关键的铁路基础设施，为区域城市提供高效且具有成本效益的供应链和消费者运输。 完整且可持续的铁路系统包括基础设施、信号、运营、人员和维护。 随着铁路网络的发展和增长，铁路供应商和运营商需要达到行业和全球安全和网络安全标准，以降低风险并向利益相关者保证，” HIMA 亚太区副总裁 Friedhelm Best 说。 "铁路运营商有一种趋势，即在运营中走向独立，并且拥有能够独立运行的系统，运营商和供应商将需要提供能够 100%兼容和可靠性的互操作性和解决方案，以及未来符合标准和偏好的产品和解决方案。
PT Len Industri 加强与 HIMA 的关系
2016 年，HIMA 与 PTLen Industri 签署了一项重要战略合同，以价值 180 万欧元的价格升级印尼 25 个火车站的安全技术，这是 HIMA 当时在亚太地区最大的铁路合同。PT Len Industri 和铁路运营商评估了所有可用的选项，并确定 HIMA 设备使用的开源通信架构是使其投资未来趋势的最佳方式，并将新的 HIMA 设备与其他供应商的遗留系统和技术无缝集成。
升级 Cikarang-Cikampek 铁路，达到最高安全标准
这次合作中向前迈出的一步，即是 PTLen Industri 和 PTLen Railway Systems 取代了 Cikarang-Cikampek 铁路上现有的联锁系统，以最大限度地提高安全性和可靠性。

Round one,you get over production and over consumption. 
The reason you get that is because the barrier of entry into a certain activity is lowered and you get too much consumption of it and too much production of it.
We saw that with what's proliferated on the supply side and we saw too many people coming in who didn't quite understand what the crypto space really is.
They just saw prices going up and thought that would go on for ever. 
We're washing all of that out. We're washing out the supply side and the demand side.
And the hope is that this will re-establish a stronger foundation.
This tends to happen during innovations.
This happened during the steam engine, it happened during fiber optics, it even happened during circuitization in the early 2000s.

使用 docker 启动了 elasticsearch 8.0 ，因为这个版本的 es 是使用 https 请求的，所以 curl 测试的时候要带上自签证书
curl --cacert http_ca.crt -u elastic:elastic123 https://127.0.0.1:9200

想暴露一部分接口给公网访问，就用 nginx 反代，nginx 的域名已经使用了 acme 签发的证书，前面我还在想 nginx 怎么配置 localtion /es/ 那部分的证书，大概参考了这个文档：
https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/securing-http-traffic-upstream/

但实际上，反代之后，请求 https://reverse.com/es/ 的域名，location /es/ {} 下不用配置 elasticsearch 自签的证书都可以，这个是什么原理？

  location /es/ {
     proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:9200/;
     include proxy.conf;
  }

本地不带证书请求会错误
curl -u elastic:elastic123 https://127.0.0.1:9200
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.


请求反代的域名直接可以

Brazil’s telecoms regulator Anatel has launched a public consultation on a proposal to make USB-C chargers mandatory for all smartphones sold in the country.
It’s the latest example of lawmakers and regulators turning to USB-C as a common charging standard for phones. The EU passed a law on the matter earlier this month, making USB-C mandatory for a range of electronic gadgets (including smartphones) by the end of 2024, and in the US some Democrat politicians are pushing for similar legislation. 
“Aware of the aforementioned movements in the international market, Anatel’s technical area evaluated the topic and presented a proposal with a similar approach for application in the Brazilian market,” said Anatel in a blog post (English...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[imeoer: 
已经很久没来 V2EX 了，最近几年发生了很多事，我的个人项目 纸小墨 因为 markdown 编辑器竞品太多，以及自己精力问题，鸽掉了（非常对不起当初期待的用户们...）。
我一直的想法都是，用 markdown 写文字应该是纯粹的，不用太关注在格式上。就像 John Gruber 说的，markdown 格式应当是可作为纯文本发布的，它的语法完全由标点符号组成，这些符号让其本身就代表了字面上的意思，我现在也特别喜欢直接用 vscode 写 markdown ，所以纸小墨当时就考虑了用 monaco editor (vscode 的底层编辑器) 作为底层编辑器。
每每看到之前仔细设计的界面，我都在想要不要再尝试一次，但面对市场上繁多的 markdown 编辑器，就觉得以自己的精力很难做出一个有竞争力的产品，于是在尝试与放弃之间来回摇摆。
所以我想把目前所写的代码开源出来，看大家是否有兴趣参与，没兴趣也没关系，就当看看热闹就好，反正市场上多一个轮子也没什么坏处。
纸小墨也可以叫 “小语文稿”，我很热爱国风设计，所以视觉上用了墨色和朱红色，可能除了坚持纯文本呈现 markdown 外，设计也算得上一个小特色吧（虽然咋一看像 Bear?）。这张图是目前的运行时截图，完成度还很低，如果大家有反响，我会在整理好代码后就开源在 github 上，我也会在业余时间提供全部的设计稿支持，以推进项目的开发。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that GitLive's flagship feature, early merge conflict detection, now works across all branches in VS Code! 🎉 
When we first introduced real-time merge conflict detection, only the changes from each of your teammates’ current branch were shown in the gutter. This meant you could miss a merge conflict from changes in a branch that is not currently being worked on, for instance, changes from a PR waiting for review. Now the change indicators in the gutter of the editor show changes from all branches that contain changes compared to your current branch.
And, as before, and as long as you are not in offline mode, this includes the unpushed changes of your teammates that are also not in offline mode for real-time, instant merge conflict detection!

Previously you had a simple switch to show or hide the indicators you see in the gutter of the editor. Now, similar to the team window, you can filter the change indicators shown in the gutter of your editor by type.
It’s worth noting that these filters are independent of the team window filters, but when you change the team window filters the gutter indicator filters are automatically updated to match (but not vice versa). To open the gutter filters menu, click on the GitLive icon in the upper right corner of VS Code.

🔸 Pushed Changes. Turning off pushed changes will hide the indicators coming from the pushed changes on other branches.
👉  Both pushed and unpushed changes are on by default, turn both off to hide the indicators completely 
That’s it for now, we would love to know what you think of these updates and how we can make GitLive better for you, so please reach out via the comments section below.
Don't have the GitLive extension installed yet? You can find it here, and if want to learn more about the latest release, check out this blog post.]]></summary>

The layoffs — first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by TechCrunch — are the latest job losses at Tesla after CEO Elon Musk told company execs that the firm needed to reduce its headcount by about 10 percent. 
The layoffs centered on Tesla’s offices in San Mateo, California, where employees were working on the company’s driver-assistance feature Autopilot. Many of those affected were reportedly hourly workers tasked with labeling training data. Such work is essential for developing AI systems but often low-skilled and low-paid. In recent years, many companies have turned to cheaper sources of labor in...

Hello! In this article I will be introducing the deepface module. 
DeepFace is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion and race) framework for python.
In simple terms deepface can analyse a variety of features without the need to train your own models etc.
First we need to initialize the virtual environment that we will be using for this example, this can be done via:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

Create a requirements.txt file and add the following:
# requirements.txt
deepface

Then install via:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a main.py file and import the following modules:
import argparse
from deepface import DeepFace

Next we need to create the main function:

本人是做大数据开发，做工程化的，毕业从业五年，27 岁，也算熟练掌握大数据相关技术栈和项目解决经验，前期也做了很多 javaweb 和 pythonweb 相关工作，但是不深。
最近觉得，长期做大数据开发，薪资上也有点要不上价，在新一线最高最高 20k+就是天花板了，再高我也没那个能力，所以想转行做数据挖掘，因为有开发经验，想着这些都是加分项，和数据预处理的相关度也比较高，所以想开始学习数据挖掘相关内容。
我觉得搞工程相对搞分析挖掘门槛稍微低一些，所以想在有这些工程经验之后，再从事相对难点的，薪资高点，竞争力高点的工作，且可以长期做的。近几年大数据是有很大需求，但是做久了也萌生了很大的危机感。
最近查简历，又发现很多这个岗位都是硕士起步，再加上我本科是双非，没有比较好的敲门砖，所以想考个好一点的相关专业的在职硕士，想着在竞争力上提升一些。
想问下大佬们，这个路线是否可以，是否算是提升，平时业余时间稍微多一些，有精力学习。
我是继续埋头搞大数据开发，还是努力考研，学习数据分析相关内容，转数据挖掘相关行业呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Increased flexibility and scalability


Flexibility and scalability is a big advantage of cloud computing. Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that it allows businesses to scale their operations up or down as needed, without incurring the costs of buying and maintaining their own infrastructure. This can be a huge advantage for businesses that experience seasonal spikes in demand, or that are growing rapidly and need to be able to respond quickly to changes in demand.
Another benefit in cloud computing is the ability to quickly deploy new applications and services, This can be a big advantage when businesses need to respond quickly to market changes or new opportunities.
Businesses can use cloud computing for a variety of purposes, including storage, backup, recovery, computing, and networking. Storage is one of the most popular uses for the cloud, as it allows businesses to store data offsite and access it from anywhere. 
Despite the fact that enhanced security is not a guarantee, cloud computing still offers a number of advantages in this area. By taking advantage of the security measures offered by cloud providers, businesses can help protect their data and applications from unauthorized access.
Overall, the benefits of cloud computing are vast and varied. I hope this article has inspired you to take advantage of all the cloud has to offer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[早在 2009 年，Minecraft 就来到了这个世界。从那时起，它已经成为一种文化现象。在这段时间里，一些开发者发布了具有类似想法和机制的开源游戏。今天，我们将看看其中最大的一个：Minetest。

什么是 Minetest？



Minetest，简单地说，是一个基于体素voxel的沙盒游戏，与 Minecraft 非常相似。与 Minecraft 不同的是，Minetest 是用 C++ 编写的，并被设计成可以在大多数系统上原生运行。它也有一个非常大的地图区域。地图大小为 “62,000 × 62,000 × 62,000 块”，“你可以向下开采 31,000 块，或向上建造 31,000 块”。

有趣的是，Minetest 最初是以专有许可证发布的，但后来被重新授权为 GPL。此后，它又被重新授权为 LGPL。

Minetest 有几种模式。你可以建造并发挥创意，或者你可以尝试在各种元素中生存。你并不局限于这些模式。Minetest 有大量的 额外内容，包括 模组mod、纹理包和在 Minetest 中建立的游戏。这主要是通过 Minetest 的 模组 API 和 Lua 完成的。



对于那些玩过 Minecraft 的人来说，你会发现 Minetest 中的体验非常相似。你可以挖掘资源，建造结构，并结合材料来制作工具。我在 Minetest 中没有注意到的一件事是怪物。我认为 Minetest 中没有任何生物，但话说回来，我只在创意模式中玩过。我还没有玩过生存模式。

Minetest 也被用于 教育。例如，瑞士 CERN 的人用 Minetest 创造了一个游戏，以 展示互联网是如何工作的 以及它是如何被创造出来的。Minetest 还被用于 教授 编程、地球科学以及微积分和三角学。



如何安装 Minetest?

Minetest 几乎在每个系统上都可以使用。下面是一个命令列表，你可以用它来在一些最流行的 Linux 发行版中安装 Minetest。

Ubuntu 或者 Debian

如果你有一个基于 Ubuntu 或 Debian 的发行版，只要在终端输入这个命令：

sudo apt install mintest


Arch 或者 Manjaro

对于基于 Arch 的系统（如 Manjaro），使用：

sudo pacman -S minetest


Fedora

你可以从 Fedora 服务器中输入以下命令安装 Mintest：

sudo dnf install mintest


openSUSE

openSUSE 用户可以用这个命令安装 Minetest：

sudo zypper in mintest


FreeBSD

FreeBSD 用户很幸运。他们可以用这个命令安装 Mintest：

pkg install minetest minetest_game


Snap

要安装 Minetest 的 Snap 包，请在终端输入以下命令：

sudo snap install minetest


Flathub

要安装，请输入：

flatpak install flathub net.minetest.Minetest


你可以在 这里 下载 Windows 的可移植执行文件。你也可以在 Android 上安装 Minetest，可以通过 Google Play 或 下载 APK。

总结



我已经在 Minetest 中花了几个小时在我的本地系统上进行构建和探索。它非常有趣。我还没来得及尝试任何额外的内容，因为我对我玩过的相对较少的游戏部分非常满意。我遇到的唯一麻烦是，由于某种原因，它在 Fedora 上运行缓慢。我可能存在一些配置上的错误。

如果你曾经认为 Minecraft 看起来很有趣，但不想花钱，那就去看看 Minetest。你会很高兴你这么做。

如果你玩过 Minetest，在评论中告诉我们你的体验如何。

One of my family's first computers ran a command-line operating system called DOS, the "Disk Operating System." I grew up with DOS, and learned to leverage the command line to make my work easier. And so did a lot of other people. We loved DOS so much that in 1994, we created the FreeDOS Project. Today on June 29, we celebrate 28 years of FreeDOS.
If you're new to FreeDOS, you may be confused about how to use the different command line programs that come with it. Let's get started with 26 of my favorite FreeDOS commands. To learn more, add the /? option after most commands to get more information:
C:\>attrib /?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[将你的大任务分为小步骤，避免自己不堪重负。




本周开始，我先回顾我的日程安排，看看我需要或想要完成的事情。通常，列表上有些较大的项目。无论来自工作上的问题，还是一系列关于生产力的文章，或者改进我家的鸡舍，当作为一项工作时，这个任务真的很艰巨。很有可能我无法坐下来，在一个时间段内，甚至在一天内完成类似（请注意，只是举例）21 篇文章之类的事情。



21 天的生产力 (Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0)

所以当我的清单上有这样的东西时，我做的第一件事就是把它分解成更小的部分。如著名的诺贝尔文学奖得主 William Faulkner 说的“移山的人，从小石头开始。”（LCTT 译注：感觉与“千里之行，始于足下”是一个意思） 我们要解决大任务（山）并且需要完成各个步骤（小石头）。

我使用下面的步骤将大任务分割为小步骤：


我通常很清楚完成一项任务需要做什么。如果没有，我会做一些研究来弄清楚这一点。

我会顺序的写下完成的步骤。

最后，我坐下来拿着我的日历和清单，开始将任务分散到几天（或几周或几个月），以了解我何时可以完成它。


现在我不仅有计划，还知道多久能完成。逐步完成，我可以看到这项大任务不仅变得更小，而且更接近完成。

军队有句古话，“遇敌无计”。 几乎可以肯定的是，有一两点（或五点）我意识到像“截屏”这样简单的事情需要扩展到更复杂的事情。事实上，在 Easy!Appointments 的截图中，竟然是：


安装和配置 Easy!Appointments

安装和配置 Easy!Appointments WordPress 插件

生成 API 密钥来同步日历

截屏


即便如此，我也不得不将这些任务分解成更小的部分——下载软件、配置 NGINX、验证安装……你明白了吧。没关系。一个计划或一组任务不是一成不变的，可以根据需要进行更改。



今年的计划已经完成了 2/3 ! (Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0)

这是一项后天习得的技能，最初几次需要一些努力。学习如何将大任务分解成更小的步骤可以让您跟踪实现目标或完成大任务的进度，而不会在过程中不知所措。

你有没有想过，电子商务平台是如何在处理巨大的流量时，做到不会卡顿的呢？有没有想过，OTT 平台是如何在同时向数百万用户交付内容时，做到平稳运行的呢？其实，关键就在于它们的分布式架构。

采用分布式架构设计的系统由多个功能组件组成。这些功能组件通常分布在多个机器上，它们通过网络，异步地交换消息，从而实现相互协作。正是由于异步消息的存在，组件之间才能实现可伸缩、无阻塞的通信，整个系统才能够平稳运行。

异步消息

异步消息的常见特性有：


消息的生产者producer和消费者consumer都不知道彼此的存在。它们在不知道对方的情况下，加入和离开系统。

消息代理broker充当了生产者和消费者之间的中介。

生产者把每条消息，都与一个“主题topic”相关联。主题是一个简单的字符串。

生产者可以在多个主题上发送消息，不同的生产者也可以在同一主题上发送消息。

消费者向代理订阅一个或多个主题的消息。

生产者只将消息发送给代理，而不发送给消费者。

代理会把消息发送给订阅该主题的所有消费者。

代理将消息传递给针对该主题注册的所有消费者。

生产者并不期望得到消费者的任何回应。换句话说，生产者和消费者不会相互阻塞。


市场上的消息代理有很多，而 Apache Kafka 是其中最受欢迎的之一。

Apache Kafka 是一个支持流式处理的、开源的分布式消息系统，它由 Apache 软件基金会开发。在架构上，它是多个代理组成的集群，这些代理间通过 Apache ZooKeeper …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、 需求介绍
因为业务模块的扩张，导致各类业务入口疯狂增加，原先的入口UI样式已经满足不了产品经理的需求了，所以他们提出了能不能仿照淘宝的业务导航栏给我们自己的产品做一个优化，废话不多说，原先他们的需求大致是这样的↓

最后经过产品和老板们的商讨，最终一致决定采用如下样式

可以看到，这个和淘宝的区别在于：
我们默认显示 4 个图标，并且有左右两个“箭头”，当ScrollView不能继续向左滑动时，左箭头隐藏，反之不能继续向右滑动时，右箭头隐藏。其他状态 “箭头”都显示。
用户可以选择点击“箭头”来实现滑动，也可以用手指左右拖动来进行滑动。当用户通过点击“箭头”滑动时，点击一次滑动4个图标，不能有偏差
我们只有一行图标需要滑动，而淘宝是两行。
此外我们还有个额外需求，当图标露出超过五分之四时，则把此图标视为可见状态，此时当用户点击”箭头“滑动时，就需要跳过此图标（也就是直接向后滑动4个）。反之图标为不可见状态时，用户点击”箭头“滑动时，则不能跳过此图标（也就是向后滑动3个图标）。例如：下图的 游乐园 图标,此时它被 ”左箭头“给遮挡了，但是超过五分之四的部分显示出来了，则视为可见状态，当用户点击 ”左箭头“ 进行滑动时，则跳过此图标，直接向后滑动4个图标。并且通过 ”箭头“ 滑动后的图标不能处于被遮挡状态，都需要完整的进行显示。

看到了大致需求后，我们来做一下技术分析，首先映入眼帘的是一个可左右滚动的View，这个第一时间想到可以用 HorizontalScrollView 来实现，但仔细一看底部有一个小进度条，这个在 HorizontalScrollView 是没有现成的可以使用的，所以只能自己去自定义一个了。最后还有就是实现左右“箭头”的点击滑动。

所以，我们这个需求需要拆分成以下几步来完成：

Google started rolling out an updated user interface for Gmail in February that pulls Meet, Chat, and Spaces closer and applies more of its Material You styling effects. Starting today, it’s becoming opt-out instead of opt-in, so your account will switch over to the new view by default pretty soon. 
It’s not a huge change, but as Google transitions through its current flavor-of-the-week messaging app and weaves its Workspace suite into a better competitor for Office, this puts more of a focus on the updated experiences.

      The old Gmail menu, with Chat and Meet aligned below your Gmail inboxes and labels.
  
If you can’t tell what’s different here, the updated UI collects buttons for Mail, Meet, Spaces,...

Did you buy one of Targus / Sanho / Hyper / HyperJuice’s nifty 100W or 65W USB-C chargers with stackable passthrough AC outlets that let you theoretically scale up to loads of powerful ports? I did — and today, I’m thinking twice about whether it belongs in my bedroom. 
Yesterday, tipster Marc-Antoine Courteau brought it to our attention that some of these devices are failing and not always in a friendly “ports stop working” way. Numerous Kickstarter backers say their units are overheating to the degree they can melt their plastic housing. “I’m lucky I was sitting with it, smelled the melting plastic, and immediately took action,” wrote one backer named Scott. 
So we asked Hyper’s PR team about it and were surprised by the company’s...

Belkin’s back at it again with its funky multi-device charging stand, but this one now supports fast charging for the Apple Watch Series 7. The new BoostCharge Pro three-in-one charger offers 15W fast charging for your iPhone 12 or 13 and 5W charging for your AirPods or AirPods Pro.
Just as Apple claims its special magnetic fast-charging cable can charge your Series 7 Watch from 0 to 80 percent in 45 minutes, Belkin says its device can do the same. While the charging stand is compatible with all older Watch models, too, fast charging is only available for the Series 7 (because it’s the only one that has the feature).

      The charger looks kinda weird without any devices on it.

The forthcoming Montblanc Summit 3 will not only run Wear OS 3, but it’ll be the first smartwatch on the new unified platform to support iOS — sort of.
The news — initially reported by Wareable — was confirmed to The Verge by Qualcomm spokesperson Lauren Miller. The Summit 3 isn’t the first smartwatch to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus platform, but it is the first to launch with Wear OS 3 already installed. The fact that it also supports iOS is a significant departure from other confirmed Wear OS 3 watches. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 lineup and the forthcoming Google Pixel Watch, for example, are exclusive to Android users.
Older Wear OS 2 and Samsung Tizen-powered smartwatches, while never incredibly popular with...

Ben Silbermann is stepping down as Pinterest’s CEO, the company announced on Tuesday. He’ll be replaced by Bill Ready, who has spent the last couple of years as head of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Silbermann isn’t leaving the company, though: he’ll be Pinterest’s executive chairman, following in the path of a number of tech CEOs who have recently gone from the daily trenches of running their company to a relatively more relaxed seat in the boardroom.
“Bill’s actually going to be a better CEO than I am for this next chapter,” Silbermann told The Wall Street Journal as part of his announcement. There’s only one way to read that: the time for the product dreamer founder is out. Pinterest’s next job is to make money. A...

Both species are in danger and are part of an ongoing exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History conveying what’s at stake if their species are lost entirely. More]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[首颗树莓派卫星完成了创纪录的飞行

第一颗使用树莓派 Zero W 作为飞行计算机的迷你卫星于 5 月重新进入地球大气层，在太空中完成了创纪录的 117 天。这颗卫星于 2022 年 1 月从国际空间站部署，是由美国犹他州立大学的大学生们开发的。它是一个立方体模块，尺寸只有 10 厘米见方，使用现成的组件建造。这颗卫星 80% 以上的软件是用 Python 编写的，并且有个装置检查其“心跳”，如果出现问题就重启解决，事实证明“重启试试”在太空同样有效。其主要目的是测试一个实验性的充气稳定系统，成功地证明了小型航天器可以在轨道上自我稳定。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：看来放个卫星也没什么难的，希望以后我们自己的空间站上也可以让同学们制造卫星放出去。




微软的内部 Linux 发行版支持内核实时补丁

上个月，微软发布了 CBL-Mariner 2.0 的第一个生产版本，这个微软内部的 Linux 发行版，用于支持从微软 Azure 到 WSL 用例等服务。CBL-Mariner 2.0 上周末进行了一次相当大的月度更新，增加了 Kpatch 以支持内核补丁，以及为内核启用实时补丁。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我感觉微软的这个内部发行版不声不响的也发展的挺快，真有一天抢了后 CentOS 市场，我觉得也不会太吃惊。




刚刚发布的 OpenSSL 3.0.4 可能存在一个比心脏流血更严重的漏洞

6 月 21 日发布的 OpenSSL 3.0.4 是为了解决一个命令注入漏洞，该漏洞在之前的补丁中没有完全解决。但这个版本本身需要进一步修复，安全研究人员称，它“容易受到远程内存损坏的影响，攻击者可以轻而易举地触发它”，可以被利用来在其中一台设备上运行任意的恶意代码。如果这个缺陷可以被远程利用（现在还不确定），它可能比心脏流血漏洞更严重。好消息是这个漏洞只影响英特尔 2016 年至 2022 年初发布的带有 AVX512 的某些 x64 芯片。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然可能影响面有限，但是一旦发布新的版本就赶快升级吧。]]></summary>

Sometimes building a simple monolith is a far better option. Microservices are solutions for use cases where scale and scalability are important. A few years ago, microservices were all the rage, made popular, especially by companies like Netflix, Spotify, Google, etc. While the hype has died down a bit, genuine use cases still exist. With ongoing advances in cloud computing technologies, building microservices as cloud-native services is the way to go due to many benefits.

Early this morning, a small NASA spacecraft about the size of a microwave embarked on the beginning of a four-month-long journey to the Moon, where it will eventually insert itself into a unique, elongated lunar orbit that no NASA mission has visited before. The spacecraft’s goal is simple: test out this particular orbit and see what it’s like. That’s because it’s the same orbit that lunar-bound astronauts could use in the coming decade.
This distinctive orbit is called “near rectilinear halo orbit,” or NRHO for short. It’s a special seven-day path that spacecraft can take around the Moon, bringing vehicles relatively close to the lunar surface for one day before they swing out far from the Moon for the other six.

In 2020, Airbnb introduced a temporary ban on house parties and events to better follow social distancing restrictions with the pandemic. Now, the company says it’s been so pleased by the outcome of the ban that it’s making it permanent and codifying its rules.
“Over time, the party ban became much more than a public health measure,” said the company in a blog post. “It developed into a bedrock community policy to support our Hosts and their neighbors.”
The ban prohibits “all disruptive parties and events,” with a particular focus on open-invite gatherings (those advertised on social media) and “party house” properties. Disruptive parties and events are essentially defined as those that attract complaints from neighbors. Airbnb says it...

Uber’s plan to electrify its driver fleet by 2030 seems to be off to a good start. The ride-hailing company announced today that over 15,000 Uber drivers have signed on to rent Tesla vehicles through its partnership with car rental company Hertz. Uber claims the deal is its “largest-ever expansion” of EVs on a mobility platform in North America and that there have already been more than 5 million Tesla rides driving over 40 million miles since the program started last year.
The popularity and demand for electric vehicles are at an all-time high for consumers, especially with the increased cost of gas. The same is true for Uber drivers, who are responsible for the costs associated with refueling the vehicles no matter what it runs on....

First, install Pillow:
pip3 install Pillow

Create a new Python file and place it where it can access your image folder. You can do this by either moving the image folder into your Python file's directory or moving the Python file into your image folder's parent directory.
You will also have to create a new folder next to your image folder for saving the edited images. I will call the folder "edited" but you can call it whatever you want.

Open your Python file and make the following imports:
from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageFont
from PIL import ImageDraw 
import os

Once that's done, add the following to your Python file.

欠款：50000
成本：400 元
参考老哥们的指点，决定走法律途径，这些年这种民事纠纷的立案门槛低了很多但是还是有很多资料要准备在这列出：
1.被告 /原告的联系方式、身份证号、户籍证明——————确定立案的法院
2.证据（聊天记录、转账记录、欠条），我没有欠条

时间轴：
4 月下旬拿到了对方的身份证号
4 月底让律师代写了一份告知函，通知还款（无法律效应），花费 200
直到五一后，对方才接收了律师函，还是在我提醒的情况下，无还款意愿
5 月上旬第一次立案，法院告知不在管辖范围，需要提供户籍证明，打电话咨询，法院工作人员服务态度很好给指点了一下
5 月中旬告知对方妻子当前情况，并通知我会法律途径，对方大赢 5 月底还清
同时我找了律师，合法的获取到了对方的户籍证明，花费 200
直到 6 月 1 日，对方还了不到 2 万，我等了几天
大概在 6 月那个不可描述的日子，我进行了再次立案，并按照户籍证明选了被告所在乡镇的法院
这期间对方还了几千...
1 周后答复不归该法院管辖，是另外一个法院，然后我再次提交
最终在提交后 2 天，法院审核通过。
大概过了一个周末，法院工作人员打电话说对方承诺立刻还钱。如果有问题再联系，结清后联系法官撤销立案。
大概又过了一周半，正式结清。
再往外借钱，我是 xxxxxxx...我 xxxxxxx
整个过程，我是抱着一颗宁肯不要钱也要把对方整成老赖的态度进行下去的。

Customer Acquisition Cost(CAC) measures how much it costs to acquire a singular customer. There are two ways to measure it: Blended CAC and Paid CAC, you’re likely going to want to be able to give both to investors.

简介
由于各种各样的原因，对 AdGuardHome 产生了一种需求：
大多数域名使用国内 dns 查询
国外域名，尤其是梯子相关域名，使用国外 dns 查询
上面这种应用场景暂时叫他分流。
为了满足上面这种 dns 分流查询，改了 AdGuardHome 和 dnsproxy 的源码，编译升级以后下午用了几个小时。
目前配置了 quic://dns-unfiltered.adguard.com 和 https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query 这两个 dns 服务商，首次查询耗时 >200ms ，后面一段时间走缓存，总体体验还可以。
源码改的比较粗糙，放在了自建的 gitlab 上，暂时不打算提 PR ，回头提个 issue 看社区有什么反馈。
其它

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zeek 是一个开源的网络安全监控工具。本文讨论了如何将 Zeek 与 ELK 集成。




在本杂志 2022 年 3 月版发表的题为“用 Zeek 轻松实现网络安全监控”的文章中，我们研究了 Zeek 的功能，并学习了如何开始使用它。现在我们将把我们的学习经验再进一步，看看如何将其与 ELK（即 Elasticsearch、Kibana、Beats 和 Logstash）整合。

为此，我们将使用一个叫做 Filebeat 的工具，它可以监控、收集并转发日志到 Elasticsearch。我们将把 Filebeat 和 Zeek 配置在一起，这样后者收集的数据将被转发并集中到我们的 Kibana 仪表盘上。

安装 Filebeat

让我们首先将 Filebeat 与 Zeek 安装在一起。使用 apt 来安装 Filebeat，使用以下命令：

sudo apt install filebeat


接下来，我们需要配置 .yml 文件，它位于 /etc/filebeat/ 文件夹中：

sudo nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml


我们只需要在这里配置两件事。在 Filebeat 输入部分，将类型改为 log，并取消对 enabled:false 的注释，将其改为 true。我们还需要指定存储日志的路径，也就是说，我们需要指定 /opt/zeek/logs/current/*.log。

完成这些后，设置的第一部分应该类似于图 1 所示的内容。



第二件要修改的事情是在输出下的 Elasticsearch 输出部分，取消对 output.elasticsearch 和 hosts 的注释。确保主机的 URL 和端口号与你安装 ELK 时配置的相似。我们把它保持为 localhost，端口号为 92…]]></summary>

It hasn’t released a competitive flagship device in years, but HTC’s smartphone division isn’t throwing in the towel just yet. Today it announced the HTC Desire 22 Pro, a follow-up to last year’s HTC Desire 21 Pro, and the company’s big attempt at capitalizing on the so-called metaverse. In the UK, it’s listed at £399 and will ship on August 1st.
There are a couple of different aspects to the phone’s metaverse functionality. To start with, it’s designed to be the “perfect companion” to HTC’s recently announced Vive Flow VR headset and used to access Viverse, HTC’s take on the metaverse. The headset is designed to work with any Android phone, though, so it’s not entirely clear what the Desire 22 Pro offers that isn’t available elsewhere.

In this post, we’re going to clarify what debugging is, why we do it and how can we get better at it. We’ll also reassess why debugging won't reveal all the issues or bugs in our code. 
Debugging is the process of running your code step by step with a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to seek out the exact point where you made a programming mistake. Usually, you'll understand what corrections you need to make in your code, and debugging tools often allow you to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program.

Both the su and the sudo commands allow users to perform system administration tasks that are not permitted for non-privileged users—that is, everyone but the root user. Some people prefer the sudo command: For example, Seth Kenlon recently published "5 reasons to use sudo on Linux", in which he extols its many virtues.
I, on the other hand, am partial to the su command and prefer it to sudo for most of the system administration work I do. In this article, I compare the two commands and explain why I prefer su over sudo but still use both.

In this final article that concludes my series about best practices for effective site reliability engineering (SRE), I cover some of the practical applications of site reliability engineering.
There are some significant differences between software engineering and systems engineering.
Software engineering
Focuses on software development and engineering only.
Involves writing code to create useful functionality.
Time is spent on developing repeatable and reusable software that can be easily extended.
Has problem-solving orientation.
Software engineering aids the SRE.
Systems engineering
Focuses on the whole system including software, hardware and any associa…]]></summary>

中化信息技术有限公司，简称“中化信息”，是世界 500 强企业中国中化控股有限责任公司（简称“中国中化”）的全资直属公司，依托于中国中化的信息化建设实践，建立起从咨询、设计到研发、交付及运维的服务价值链，形成涵盖生命科学、材料科学、基础化工、环境科学、轮胎橡胶、机械装备、城市运营、产业金融等行业业务应用及创新应用的 17 条产品线及解决方案，致力于通过发挥信息科技的驱动与赋能作用，助力中国中化成为世界一流的综合性化工企业。
“线上中化”战略推进，更强韧的 IT 能力成为刚需
进入工业 4.0 时代，信息技术渗透至各行各业，产业数字化应运而生。通过互联网改造，传统企业能够打通产业链上下游，使设备、工厂、供应商、产品和消费者紧密地连接和融合，以智能化、数字化的方式为消费者提供更高品质的服务体验，打造更高价值的产业生态，构建强大的数字生态系统。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, I will solve a Ups n Downs CSS Challenge on CSS Battle. Let's look at the problem first.
We need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:

So now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. 
<p class="left"></p>
<p class="middle"></p>
<p class="right"></p>

Now let's style the containers. 
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: #62306d;
}
.middle,
.left,
.right {
  position: absolute;
  background: #f7ec7d;
  width: 100;
  height: 100;
  border-radius: 10rem 10rem 0 0;
  margin-top: 50;
}
.middle {
  left: 150;
}
.left,
.right {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  bottom: 34;
}
.left {
  left: 50;
}
.right {
  right: 50;
}

In CSS Battle you can use 100 instead of 100px. You don't need to define px in CSS. However, if you are using rem or % then you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info visit here  





  
  
  Alternate Solution


There could be many Alternative Solution I've used this one because of the less characters and simplicity.
<p l></p>
<p m></p>
<p r></p>

Here I am using <p> tag and inside them l stands for left, m stands for middle and r stands for right.
body{
  margin:0;
  background:#62306D;
}
p[m],p[l],p[r]{
  position:absolute;
  background:#F7EC7D;
  width:100;
  height:100;
  border-radius:10rem 10rem 0 0;
  margin-top:50;
}
p[m]{
  left:150;
}
p[l],p[r]{
  transform:rotate(180deg);
  bottom:34;
}
p[l]{
  left:50;
}
p[r]{
  right:50;
}

Minify the code or CSS by using any CSS Minifier. It helps you to reduce the characters in the code that will increase score.
If you like this then don't forget to ❤️ it. And I'll see you in the next article. See you soon.]]></summary>

给我感觉是大家闷头抄的不亦乐乎. 真的需要把所有功能都放进去么???
我感觉是不是有些功能保留为按钮更直观方便, 或者类似 office 那种选中后浮出工具条.

浏览网页可能占了你一天中的大部分时间。然而，你总是需要手动浏览，这很讨厌，不是吗？你必须打开浏览器，然后访问一个网站，单击按钮，移动鼠标……相当费时费力。如果能够通过代码与互联网交互，岂不是更好吗？

在 Python 的 requests 模块的帮助下，你可以使用 Python 从互联网中获取数据：

import requests

DATA = "https://opensource.com/article/22/5/document-source-code-doxygen-linux"
PAGE = requests.get(DATA)

print(PAGE.text)


在以上代码示例中，你首先导入了 requests 模块。接着，你创建了两个变量：其中一个叫做 DATA，它用来保存你要下载的 URL。在之后的代码中，你将能够在每次运行应用程序时提供不同的 URL。不过，就目前而言，最简单的方法是“硬编码”一个测试 URL，以达到演示目的。

另一个变量是 PAGE。代码读取了存储在 DATA 中的 URL，然后把它作为参数传入 requests.get 函数，最后用变量 PAGE 来接收函数的返回值。requests 模块及其 .get 函数的功能是：“读取”一个互联网地址（一个 URL）、访问互联网，并下载位于该地址的任何内容。

当然，其中涉及到很多步骤。幸运的是，你不必自己弄清楚，这也正是 Python 模块存在的原因。最后，你告诉 Python 打印 requests.get 存储在 PAGE 变量的 .text 字段中的所有内容。

Beautiful Soup

如果你运行上面的示例代码，你会得到示例 URL 的所有内容，并且，它们会不加选择地输出到你的终端…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这会成为放弃基于 Chromium 的浏览器并开始使用 Firefox 的一个理由吗？也许吧，决定权在你。




即使你有了所有的隐私扩展和各种保护功能，别人仍然有方法可以识别你或跟踪你。

请注意，并非所有浏览器都是如此，本文中，我们主要关注基于 Chromium 的浏览器，并将谷歌 Chrome 作为“主要嫌疑人”。

以前，在 Chromium 浏览器上，尽管别人已经能够检测到你已安装的扩展程序，但许多扩展程序都实施了某些保护措施来防止这种检测。

然而，一位名为 “z0ccc” 的安全研究人员发现了一种检测已安装 Chrome 浏览器扩展程序的新方法，该方法可进一步用于通过“浏览器指纹识别”来跟踪你。

如果你还不知道的话：浏览器指纹识别Browser Fingerprinting是指收集有关你的设备/浏览器的各种信息，以创建唯一的指纹 ID（哈希），从而在互联网上识别你的一种跟踪方法。“各种信息”包括：浏览器名称、版本、操作系统、已安装的扩展程序、屏幕分辨率和类似的技术数据。

这听起来像是一种无害的数据收集技术，但可以使用这种跟踪方法在线跟踪你。

检测谷歌 Chrome 扩展

研究人员发布了一个开源项目 “Extension Fingerprints”，你可以使用它来测试你安装的 Chrome 扩展是否能被检测到。

新技术涉及一种“时间差”方法，该工具比较了扩展程序获取资源的时间。与浏览器上未安装的其他扩展相比，受保护的扩展需要更多时间来获取资源。因此，这有助于从 1000 多个扩展列表中识别出一些扩展。

关键是：即使有了各种新的进步和技术来防止跟踪，Chrome 网上应用店的扩展也可以被检测到。



并且，在检测到已安装的扩展程序后，别人可以就使用浏览器指纹识别，对你进行在线跟踪。

令人惊讶的是，即使你安装有 uBlocker、AdBlocker、或 Privacy Badger（一些流行的以隐私为重点的扩展程序）之类的扩展程序，使用了这种方法，它们也都可以被检测到。

你可以在它的 GitHub 页面 上查看所有技术细节。如果你想自己测试它，请前往它的 扩展指纹识别网站 自行检查。

拯救 Firefox？

嗯，似乎是的，毕竟我出于各种原因，不断回到 Firefox。

这个新发现的（跟踪）方法应该适用于所有基于 Chromium 的浏览器。我在 Brave 和谷歌 Chrome 上都测试了这个方法。研究人员还提到，该工具不能在使用微软应用商店中的扩展的微软 Edge 上工作。但是，相同的跟踪方法仍然有效。

正如研究人员指出，Mozilla Firefox 可以避免这种情况，因为每个浏览器实例的扩展 ID 都是唯一的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[温馨提示：改装有风险，刷机需谨慎。

我买了台二手的 iPod Video
最近买了一台来自 2005 年的 iPod Classic 第五代，它是首款能播放 h264 也就是 mp4 视频的 iPod，所以也被称为 iPod Video。我的这台是 190 元在闲鱼「捡到的」，30G 机械硬盘的版本，对是机械硬盘。你在切歌和开机的时候都能听到硬盘「cici」的声音，有一点点烦人，好处是你要是愿意还能买到 60G 甚至 80G 的版本（会更厚），在那个年代算得上是海量的存储了。

这台 iPod Video 已经走过了 17 个年头，应该也跟随陪伴过 n 位主人，在外观上留下了不少他们拥有过的痕迹，收到的时候里面还有几首已经不再流行的歌曲。电池当然不太经用了，但正常听歌使用完全没问题。

如果你是 Apple TV 用户，你会发现 iPod 和 TV 的遥控器设计的特别像，相同的配色、相同的按键逻辑，让人感叹十几年过去了苹果的设计语言似乎没有发生过改变，我更希望的是在 2022 年它还能继续陪伴我更久一点。
改装 1TB 透明版

萌生改装的想法是在时间线上看到 ellie 的分享，透明的外壳配合 iPod Video 的主板真的好看呐。有了想法之后就搜寻各种合适的配件和教程发现：iPod Video 的所有模块基本都能买到，并且拆卸安装也只需要翘板和螺丝刀整个过程也比较简单。

需要的材料

iPod Video 30G 版本（Video 的外壳是塑料的更换简单可选择的多，30G 版本便宜一点，30G 后壳的选择也多很多，因为前盖和后盖都是更换的，成色不用太在意，屏幕上有一层外壳保证屏幕正常显示就 OK）
你喜欢颜色的前盖和后盖（可以按照你的风格进行搭配，如果需要转盘和中间的按钮也是可以买到的）
双 TF 卡拓展板 + 大电池（因为之前里面是机械硬盘，换到 TF 卡后就有足够的空间让给电池，这家买是有送翘板等工具的，小的螺丝刀得自己准备）
TF 卡（个人推荐买一张 128G 的就完全足够使用了）

以上可以自行购买，我的都是看着顺眼买的，没有过多讲究更没有利益关系。

拆解推荐看看 iFixit 的教程，每个模块都有专业图文并貌的描述 ，以及店家提供的方法。除了第一次拆后壳稍微费点劲，其它都非常简单。如果你买的是透明壳的话，为了好看推荐你准备 WD-40 或者除胶剂对屏幕上的贴纸残胶进行下处理。在装回去之前，插上数据线连接电脑看能不能正常识别 iPod 和硬盘大小，这样可以避免你重新拆开安装的麻烦。

组装好后数据线连接电脑，打开 iTunes（如果使用的是 Mac 则是访达）选择恢复 iPod 即可，这个过程可能会比较慢耐心等待即可。
安装 Rockbox + FreshOS

iPod Video 的系统早已经没有了更新，iTunes 在 Mac 上也不复存在，但我还是得说一句 iTunes 是真的难用。Rockbox 则是一个开源免费的音乐播放器系统，适配了众多款的 iPod 以及其它品牌的音乐播放器。我选择使用 Rockbox 看中了持续更新的系统、对音乐格式有更好的支持、众多个性化的主题、更加丰富的功能、倒入音乐也不需要 iTunes，直接拖入就行、另外原有的系统也不受影响。

Rockbox 的安装极其简单方便，下载好官方安装程序，连接上 iPod，选择 Install 即可直接完成安装。

FreshOS 是基于 Rockbox 的一款第三方主题，有 Light 和 Dark 两个版本。安装同样非常简单，下载 FreshOS 后将 .rockbox 文件夹内所有文件拖进 iPod 的 .rockbox 文件夹内直接覆盖即可完成安装。
改装好的 iPod
透明+黑色转盘蓝色的后盖搭配 se215 耳机Rockbox 遥控器
除了漂亮以外，最大的感觉是轻了很多很多，因为之前的机械硬盘在体积和重量上占的比例都很大。我自己改装成了 512G + 512G 也就是 1TB 的版本 ，其实真的用不到那么大的空间，主要接口导入速度的限制，太大的空间也不实用。续航真是好了太多，除了电池换了新的以外，电池容量也直接大了好几倍，加上 TF 卡也更省电了。还有一个我非常喜欢的功能：上文提到过 Apple TV 的遥控器和 iPod 很像，在 Rockbox 系统下 iPod 连接电脑能直接作为电脑的遥控器，切换歌曲控制音量，一气呵成。

简述
Android Target 版本作为应用和系统版本间的“协议”与“桥梁”，在厂商预装合作、应用商店曝光、开放能力方面都是一个重要衡量标准，近年来谷歌和手机厂商对于 Target 升级的推动速度和力度明显加大。Target 版本越高，对系统和用户的安全性相应越好，但其对应用的改动、约束和不明确的坑也随之增多，尤其是对使用系统API范围广、业务复杂、稳定性要求高的超级应用挑战很大。
高德地图此次一鼓作气从 Target 28 升级到 最新的 Target31，成为业界首个升级到最新版本的头部应用，满足了应用市场、厂商预装合规的要求，为后续市场先发、预装合作等赢得了时间窗口。第一个“吃螃蟹”，踩了不少坑，因此我们总结了升级过程中遇到的问题、原理、解决方案及操作方式，希望能帮大家在升级 Target 中事半功倍。
1.1 释义：何为 Target 版本
Target 版本，用白话意思是「告知系统我已满足指定系统版本的合规要求，并愿意受约束」。具体指:
从约束上，和一般的强制约束（例如用户升级到 Android 12 就必须满足某个条件）不同，Target 版本为我们提供了一种“柔和、缓冲适配”的途径，允许用户在升级 Android 12 时，先临时不受新系统约束（Target 为老版本），而是等自己“准备就绪后”在升级 Target 版本以满足约束，更具灵活性；
从强度上，Target 版本越高，受到的约束越多，且约束力越强，这里的版本为“系统 API 版本号”，和 Android 版本一一对应，如 28 对应的是 Android 9，29 为 Android 10，以此类推。
1.2 挑战：变化快、成本高的原因
为什么近期 Target 升级推动快、成本高呢？从行业发展和技术的角度来看：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景

近期，无意间重新翻阅了一下 Android 官方文档，发现文章的目录结构有不少改动的地方。我尝试从这些改动的地方，一探 Android App 架构的演进方向。当然文档中包含的主题有很多，本文主要从架构相关的主题进行介绍。
官方文档中，中文与英文中的目录结构并不相同，英文版本结构更加合理，中文文档结构应该是翻译进度问题有所滞后。也正是由于这种滞后的现象，才可以更加方便的对比出官方对于各项技术的思考。
下面我们就看下具体的差异点在什么地方。
突出架构设计，独立为章节
在中文版本的文档中，架构相关的内容散落在核心主题的各处，而在英文版本中则将架构部分单独抽成一个相对独立的部分。

英文版本中相较于中文版本的改动主要有以下几点：
新增 App architecture 章节，并且在核心主题（Core topics）之上；
将核心主题中的新版架构指南、架构组件、导航内容放入架构章节；
将最佳实践章节中的依赖注入放入架构章节；
下面会对涉及的改动的部分做一个详细的展开。
架构指南
指南这部分在中文版本中无法在目录结构中无法直接索引，英文版本中则可以比较清晰的看到 UI Layer、Domain Layer、Data Layer 等内容。

架构组件
架构组件目前看是 Jetpack 系列组件的子集，包含大家日常过程中可能会经常使用到的组件。
中文版本中，这部分是直接罗列；在英文版本中则是对其进行了分类。
UI 相关的组件放到了 UI Layer 中，数据相关的则放到了 Data Layer 中。UI Layer 中对生命周期相关的内容做了个收敛。

App 入口（App Entry points）
App 入口这部分在中文版本中是没有定义的，在英文版本中则是把核心主题的 Activity 内容做了拆分。讲中文中的 Activity 原先内容中抽离出了额外的两部分：Shortcuts 和 App Widgets。Shortcuts调整成和 Activity 平级，都是 App 的入口，App Widgets 则是继续待在核心主题部分。

App 导航
App 导航部分英文版本也是中文版本做了一次梳理，逻辑更加清晰。除了包含 Jetpack 组件中的 Navigation 之外，还有 Fragment 、App Links 以及 ViewPager 等内容。

依赖管理
这部分内容基本上内容没有调整，仅仅是从最佳实践部分移动到App 架构部分。

App Startup
这部分在中文版本中是在架构组件内，英文版本中是和依赖注入、App导航等内容是平级的关系，这也是比较好理解的。
大胆预测
根据个人理解，英文版本中的组织结构应该也不是最终版本，也会不断更新的。我个人觉得后面还会有相关的知识点会纳入到 App 架构的章节中。下面就是我个人的大胆预测。
Data Layer 中会新增 Room 库，当然可能不仅仅会新增 Room 库，整个数据及文件部分都有可能移入到 Data Layer 中，目前 Room 库也是在数据及文件部分的。
App 入口部分加入 App Widgets/Glance 及 Service 部分，App Widgets 比较好理解，在技术方面他是和 App Shortcuts 类似的东西，对外暴露的 Service，也可以当做是 App 的入口，当然这部分也可以当做是代码块调用的入口。
整体结构如下：

总结
通过对比中英版本文档，我们可以看到官方文档对各个知识点组织方式的演进方向。除了 App 的分层架构之外，还在逐步完善 App 整体架构。
也是期望通过这次对官方文档的梳理，能够将 Jetpack 中常用的一些组件库在大家的脑海中建立一个网状关系，知道知识与知识之间的关系及链接，建立自己的知识网络。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
高产似母猪的我，又带来了干货记录，本次是对signal的一个总结与回顾。不知道你们开发中，是否会遇到小部分的nativecrash 或者 anr，这部分往往是由第三方库导致的或者当前版本没办法修复的bug导致的，往往这些难啃的crash，对现有的crash数据指标造成一定影响，同时也对这小部分crash用户不友好，那么我们有没有办法实现一套crash or anr重启机制呢？其实是有的，相信在各个大厂都有一套“安全气囊”装置，比如crash一定次数就启用轻量版本或者自动重新启动等等，下面我们来动手搞一个这样的装置！这也是我第三个s开头的开源库Signal
注意：前方高能！阅读本文最好有一点ndk开发的知识噢！没有也没关系，冲吧！
Native Crash
native crash不同于java/kotlin层的crash，在java环境中，如果程序出现了不可预期的crash（即没有捕获），就会往上抛出给最终的线程uncaghtexceptionhandler，在这里我们可以再次处理，比如屏蔽某个exception即可保持app的稳定，然后native层的crash不一样，native 层的crash大多数是“不可恢复”的，比如某个内存方面的错误，这些往往是不可处理的，需要中断当前进程，所以如果发生了native crash，我们转移到自定义的安全处理，比如自动重启后提示用户等等，就会提高用户很大的体验感（比起闪退）
信号量机制
当native 层发生异常的时候，往往是通过信号的方式发送，给相对应的信号处理器处理

我们可以从signal.h看到，大概已经定义的信号量有
/**

#define SIGINT 2
#define SIGQUIT 3

前言
最近在预研一款换装的小游戏，通过在积分乐园中兑换服装，就可以在不同场景中展示穿上新服装的角色。对于这类有主题形象的动画，自然就想到了骨骼动画，通过网格自由变形和蒙皮技术就能在视觉上呈现所需要的动画效果，并且骨骼动画也支持皮肤替换，或者插槽的图片替换，对于换装的需求比较友好。因此决定使用骨骼动画来实现换装小游戏的Demo，以下就是在Android平台上实现DragonBones换装的过程。

技术选型
对于DragonBones在Android端的渲染显示，有多个方案可以选择，例如：白鹭引擎或者Cocos2d游戏引擎。最终选择使用korge来进行渲染，为什么抛弃Cocos2d这个广泛使用的游戏引擎来渲染呢？主要理由是：
Cocos2d 游戏引擎加载比较耗时，其首次加载时间无法接受；
Cocos2d 编译出来的底层依赖需要单独裁剪，裁剪后的libcocos.so依然较大；
Cocos2d 对于游戏动画的渲染，其渲染的载体是Activity，也就是编译出来的CocosActivity，这个是无法满足业务需要的。因此需要自定义游戏容器，并且需要修改动画加载的容器载体和加载路径。简单点来说，可以从任意路径来加载游戏资源（例如网络或者本地，不仅仅是assets目录），并且可以在自定义View中进行渲染。解决思路可以参考：https://juejin.cn/post/6984366261610217502

It’s that time again for another chance to buy a PlayStation 5 directly from Sony. While the console maker often sends out emails for invite-only restocks, this one’s for everyone, and it’s starting now. If you’re lucky, you’ll get through the queue and have the chance to buy a standard disc-equipped $499 PS5 or a $399 PS5 Digital Edition, and if Sony’s last console selling events are anything to go by, there should be bundles of both with Horizon Forbidden West included for a total savings of $20 off the cost of the game.
Remember that when buying a PS5 from Sony, you must log in to your PlayStation Network account, and each account can only buy one console. These queues can last up to an hour or more, and the estimated time remaining...

One of the year’s best budget phones is finally available unlocked in the US. The OnePlus Nord N20 5G launched as a T-Mobile exclusive in April, and that was the only way to get ahold of one — until now. The N20 5G is now up for sale from Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from OnePlus for $299 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.
Take note that the unlocked N20 won’t work on Verizon — not on 5G or 4G. AT&T customers will be able to connect to 4G only, which isn’t too bad of a deal given that the carrier is taking a slower approach to expanding its more meaningful mid-band 5G coverage. T-Mobile subscribers will, of course, get 5G and 4G coverage. 
This makes the unlocked N20 best suited to AT&T customers who don’t need 5G or someone on a...

使用拦截器模式重构Log框架
本来很早就像做这一篇文章，但是由于重构该功能需要很多前置技能。该文章涉及到一下知识点。所以在此篇文章之前，我先把前置技能点亮。
我们得先知道拦截器模式如何定义。
实战使用简单Demo通过拦截模式来展示弹窗。
我们还需要学会Kotlin高阶扩展函数的使用。
我们得知道Android文件路径的管理。
知道指定了路径之后我们通过IO流操作文件。
可惜我认为很重要的知识点，平台没给推荐，Anyway，在此基础上我们就能重构一个拦截器模式的日志打印保存的框架。
一、重构前的痛点
首先我们之前的Log框架，只能打印日志，美化日志的功能和打印功能耦合，没有保存日志信息的能力，无法保存指定的日志到文件，无法上传给服务端，做精准的Log分析。

熟悉我的观众都知道，我的YYLogUtils打印的日志如上图，功能都是耦合在一起的，只能暴力的开关选项，没有其他的配置。
改版之后会将不同的功能模块隔离。使用拦截器模式按需加载，每一个拦截器配置单独的开关。实现功能的引擎化，可替代化。
二、拦截器的分类与使用
在之前的设计模式中有讲到，其实拦截器模式分为简单拦截和拦截转发两种。
2.1 使用哪一种拦截器模式
如大名鼎鼎的OkHttp中的拦截器就是拦截转发的一种，它可以把上一个拦截器处理过的数据，转发到下一个拦截器中。那么通过这种值传递的方式，就可以得到处理过的数据。
而我之前的文章，通过拦截模式来展示弹窗。那是普通的拦截器，并没有拦截转发的功能，是我不想这么用吗？不是，是没有必要，业务场景的需求如此，我们的变量控制是由接口返回，是由外部控制的，不需要传递值。
那么如果设计一个Log的打印保存框架，我们如果使用…]]></summary>

今天这篇文章的目的是补全大家对于 MediaQuery  和对应 rebuild 机制的基础认知，相信本篇内容对你优化性能和调试 bug 会很有帮助。
Flutter 里大家应该都离不开 MediaQuery  ，比如通过 MediaQuery.of(context).size 获取屏幕大小 ，或者通过  MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top  获取状态栏高度，那随便使用 MediaQuery.of(context) 会有什么问题吗？
首先我们需要简单解释一下，通过 MediaQuery.of 获取到的  MediaQueryData 里有几个很类似的参数：
viewInsets ： 被系统用户界面完全遮挡的部分大小，简单来说就是键盘高度
padding ： 简单来说就是状态栏和底部安全区域，但是 bottom 会因为键盘弹出变成 0
viewPadding  ：和 padding 一样，但是 bottom 部分不会发生改变
举个例子，在 iOS 上，如下图所示，在弹出键盘和未弹出键盘的情况下，可以看到 MediaQueryData 里一些参数的变化：
viewInsets  在没有弹出键盘时是 0，弹出键盘之后 bottom 变成 336
padding 在弹出键盘的前后区别， bottom 从 34 变成了 0
viewPadding   在键盘弹出前后数据没有发生变化

可以看到   MediaQueryData  里的数据是会根据键盘状态发生变化，又因为   MediaQuery   是一个 InheritedWidget ，所以我们可以通过 MediaQuery.of(context) 获取到顶层共享的  MediaQueryData 。
那么问题来了，InheritedWidget  的更新逻辑，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言

作为特斯拉Model Y车主，有多次和大家分享过个人用车体验、配件选择和保养分享。对于特斯拉全系车辆，每款车都有的就是内置空调滤芯。特斯拉官方的产品都是曼牌提供的，model 3和model y的原厂空调滤芯就是曼牌的FP25015，属于曼牌中带抗菌功能的高端产品。曼牌好价加工时费可以200以内搞定一对，特斯拉官方加了工时不打折是400不到，基本翻了个倍。

就是图里这款，京东链接附上，京东车品打折时价格不高，推荐车主朋友每逢大促购置以备更换，其它的马勒、博世、科德宝等大的品牌也都有对应的产品，同样可以考虑。

但对于Model Y而言，多了一套HEPA高效空气过滤系统。虽然这个名词看起来很高级，本质上就是在驾舱外的空调进气口多了外置的空调滤芯。比起Model 3，这套外置的滤芯让全车实现了两重的空调过滤，整体的过滤效果更好，也让空调支持了一个生化模式。

在空调界面，通过这个病毒一样的图标就可以开启这个模式（图为老系统，新系统的按键位置有所改变）。在生化模式下，空调会高档位进气，让驾舱内形成正压状态，外界空气无法从缝隙进入驾舱，官方说在雾霾天能保证更好的空气质量，但我在上海用车一年也遇不到太多天的大雾霾，但我觉得车内空气不理想时，会开启这一模式，实际效果不错。
正因为这一模式下空调会高流量运行，就对滤芯有更高的要求，所以也只有配置了外置滤芯的Model Y才有这个功能。
去年3月提车，4月上牌开始用车，加上今年上海居家两个月，我的车实际使用就是1年加2万公里，去年更换过一次内置的空调滤芯。

这是我去年1万公里时换下来的内置小滤芯，就是曼牌的FP25015，1万公里更换有些浪费了，小滤芯的状态还是比较不错的。
今年马上入夏，属于空调高频使用周期，所以计划更换外置的HEPA大滤芯，最初我也打算电商购买，结果因为没弄明白产品，也以为官方不贵，去官方售后预约了服务，最后…]]></summary>

Qt Creator 是 Qt 框架的默认集成开发环境（IDE），同时也是丰富的 Qt 库和用户之前的粘合剂。除了如智能代码补全、调试、项目管理等基础功能外，Qt Creator 还提供了很多让软件开发变得更简单的特性。

在这篇文章中，我会重点介绍一些我最喜欢的 Qt Creator 特性。

深色模式

当我使用一个新的应用时，我的第一个问题是：它有深色模式吗？ Qt Creator 的回答是：你更喜欢哪一种深色模式呢？

你可以在“选项Options”菜单中激活深色模式。在顶部的菜单栏中，点击“工具Tools”，选择“选项Options”，然后转到“环境Environment”部分。下面是你能选择的常用外观：



定制外观

像每一个 Qt 应用一样，借助样式表，Qt Creator 的外观是高度可定制化的。下面，你可以按照我的做法给 Qt Creator一个想要的外观。

将下面这些内容写入 mycustomstylesheet.css 文件中：

QMenuBar { background-color: olive }
QMenuBar::item { background-color: olive }
QMenu { background-color : beige; color : black }
QLabel { color: green }


然后使用命令行开启 Qt Creator，将样式表作为参数传入：

qtcreator -stylesheet=mycustomstylesheet.css


IDE 现在看上去应该会变成这样：



在这份 文档 中可以查阅更多的样式表。

命令行参数

Qt Creator 可接受很多命…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[⏹ 前言
虽然现在电脑各项硬件已经防呆模块化，但特殊装机是个非常吃经验的技术活，特别是目前很流行的ITX主机，主要难点在装机单撰写（硬件适配）和实际安装上。

 
趁着618给自己组了一套ITX测试机，以它为例分享下选择配件+装机经验，尽可能帮助新手少走弯路，觉得有用欢迎点赞收藏评论三联哈。

 
⏹ 本文目录
由于细节比较多导致文章比较长，先放一下目录，大家可以按需跳转观看。

 
⏹ 难点梳理
和普通装机相比，ITX主机在选购时候就需要考虑非常多，方案选择有问题会导致硬件压根装不了，这段按照优先级别排序给大家梳理下。
1️⃣ 购机预算
准备花多少钱是重中之重，就电脑硬件而言，定价有以下三个定律：

同级别的硬件体积越小越贵
颜色（白色/粉色）越特殊越贵
无线设备比同款有线版本贵

所以高颜值ITX主机注定便宜不了，看下面这次的装机单的预算统计就知道了。

 
不看预算装机是不可取的行为，动手前先确认自己的需求，个人归纳有以下几个方向：

A：轻度使用，简单办公、观影和普通网游这类场景对硬件几乎没有什么特别的需求，核显一样能用，不考虑硬件性能的ITX装机非常轻松。
B：游戏玩家，对CPU的需求其实不算高，独立显卡是刚需，预算跟着游戏配置要求走，个人建议不要考虑ITX方案，刀卡和短卡都只有甜品卡可选。
C：专业领域，作图、编程等生产力需求对主机各有偏重，相同点是内存容量刚需，ITX装机挺合适，建议跟着软件需求走，多的预算加显示器、键鼠等外设上对工作帮助很大。
D：颜值玩具，不管是为了玩光污染还是追求安静，针对这两类的硬件都不算便宜，量力而行比较合适。

 
特别提醒：如果预算不多个人建议退一步选紧凑型M-ATX方案，平头哥这类机箱比ITX大不了多少，对硬件包容度高且便宜很多。

 
2️⃣ 机箱尺寸
ITX机箱有很多种，自组DIY主机在选购时常规按照体积或者结构这两个维度去…]]></summary>

The sort of sweet talking, finessing, and gut-decisions that might work in a bull market falls apart very quickly as soon as an investor, customer, or any other stakeholder lowers their risk intolerance.
If you’re trying to raise money right now, and you don’t have killer revenue numbers to back up your claims, you’re going to need to make predictions off of all the good data that you work with.
But how can you effectively leverage the information you have into coherent predictions? That’s where Bayes Rule comes in.

被誉为互联网之父的蒂姆-伯纳斯-李，他赞同 Web3 所宣称的“将数据从大科技公司转移到用户手中”的使命，但他采取了不同的途径来实现这一目标。他的 Solid 是用标准的网络工具和开放规范建立的。私人信息存储在被称为“豆荚”的去中心化数据存储中，用户可以在任何地方托管，可以选择哪些应用程序可以访问他们的数据。但他不认同区块链，“当你试图在区块链上建立这些东西时，根本不行。”虽然，他通过将其开发的第一个互联网网站做成 NFT 赚了 540 万美元。


消息来源：The Next Web



老王点评：我认为理想化的想将数据从互联网商业巨头手中拿回来，那是不行的，即便技术上可行，经济上也不可行。我看好区块链的是地方是，它是一种新的经济分配模型，一种新的生产力关系。




Rust 连续第七年成为开发者最喜欢的编程语言

Stack Overflow 发布了 2022 年的年度开发者调查报告，180 个国家的逾 7.3 万名开发者参与了调查。JavaScript 仍然是最常用的语言，其次是 HTML/CSS；Rust 连续第七年成为开发者最喜欢的编程语言；最喜欢的数据库是 PostgreSQL 和 Redis；开发者最常用的操作系统是 Windows，WSL 使用率从 2021 年的 3% 增加到了 14%；Neovim 和 VSCode 是最喜欢的 IDE；Git 是最常用的版本控制系统，占 93.87%；


消息来源：Stack Overflow



老王点评：虽然年年都有很多机构在发布各种程序员调查，但是仔细看看这份调查结果，你就会发现世界上的程序员们正在学习和使用什么，这对于国内程序员们来说，应该是一个有效的指引。




一些互联网史前遗迹仍然活着

根据一份研究数据，超过 1700 万美国人经常使用 MapQuest，这是最早的数字地图网站之一，它早就被谷歌和苹果超越了。而 Ask Jeeves，一个在谷歌之前就开始运行的网络搜索引擎，仍然有粉丝和人们在谷歌搜索中输入 “Ask Jeeves a question”。以及 AOL，仍然是美国前 50 个最受欢迎的网站。

Apple’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro M2 base model appears to have slower SSD speeds than its M1 predecessor. MacRumors reports that YouTubers Max Tech and Created Tech have both tested the 256GB base M2 model and discovered the SSD’s read speeds are around 50 precent slower than the M1 MacBook Pro with 256GB of storage. Write speeds are reportedly around 30 percent slower.
Testing was completed using Blackmagic’s Disk Speed Test app, and Max Tech even disassembled the 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro and found that Apple is only using a single NAND flash storage chip. The M1 MacBook Pro uses two 128GB NAND chips, and multiple chips can enable faster SSD speeds in parallel.

我们很高兴地宣布，2022 年 6 月发布的适用于 VS Code Python和 Jupyter扩展现已推出。
此版本包括以下更新：
本地化支持
Python 解释器查找
vscode.dev/github.dev 上的 Jupyter 扩展支持
Pylance 的预览体验
如果您有兴趣，可以在我们的日志中查看 Python、Jupyter和 Pylance扩展的完整更新内容。
改进的本地化支持
Python 扩展现在支持翻译 VS Code 中的所有语言。我们改变了获取命令、通知和标题文本的方式，使用由本地化团队维护的翻译，以确保它们是最新的和正确的。

主题：Horizon Extended。语言模式：葡萄牙语（巴西）。
您可以通过在命令面板中运行"Configure Display Language"命令（ Ctrl + Shift + P or ⌘ + ⇧ + P ）来更改 VS Code 显示的语言。
查找 Python 解释器的改进
我们还改进了 VS Code 触发查找 Python 解释器的方式。
以前，Python 扩展在每次激活或者加载时都会尝试查找 Python 解释器。从此版本开始，仅在首次打开新文件夹或工作区、触发"Python: Select Interpreter"命令以及刷新解释器列表时触发查找解释器。这会减少加载时间并使 language server 更快启动。
但是请注意，如果安装或启用了 Jupyter 扩展，Jupyter 在启动时仍会触发查找解释器的操作。我们正在努力改善这一流程。
vscode.dev/github.dev 上的新 Jupyter 扩展功能
我们在新的 Web 版本中对Jupyter 扩展支持更多核心功能方面取得了进展。
本月，我们将以下功能移植到了 Web 扩展：

希望对你有所帮助
“受益”于目前 Android 手机各类屏幕尺寸长短不定、宽高比例大小不一的现状，屏幕适配 依然是 Android 应用开发时绕不开的问题
我们在日常开发中使用得最多的尺寸单位应该是 dp 了，Google 也推荐开发者尽量使用 dp 作为单位值，因为系统会根据屏幕的实际情况来完成 dp 和 px 之间的对应换算，使得同个 dp 值的显示效果在不同手机屏幕上不会相差太大。但直接使用 dp 值后的最终显示效果只能说不会和设计稿相差太远，想要做到完美适配还远远不够
举个例子。我们在进行 UI 开发时，一般都是按照设计稿的规定来给 View 设定宽高和间距，假设设计稿是按照 1080 x 1920 px，420 dpi 的屏幕标准来进行设计的，也即设计稿的宽高是 411 x 731 dp，那对于一个希望占据屏幕一半宽度的 ImageView 来说，在设计稿中的宽即 205.5 dp
那么，对于一台 1440 x 2880 px，560 dpi 的真机，其宽高是 411 x 822 dp，此时我们在布局文件中就可以直接使用设计稿中给出来的宽度值 205.5 dp，使得 ImageView 在这台真机上就占据了屏幕的一半宽度。虽然设计稿和这台真机的屏幕像素尺寸并不相同，但由于屏幕像素密度的存在，使得两者的 dp 宽度是一样的，从而让开发者可以直接套用设计稿给出的 dp 值就能满足要求
既然有了 dp，那我们为什么还需要进行屏幕适配呢？当然也是因为 dp 只能适用于大部分正常情况了。以上情况之所以能够实现完美适配，那也是因为举的例子刚好也是完美的：1440  / 1080 = 560 / 420 = 1.3333，两者的 px 宽度比例和像素密度比例刚好相等，所以此时使…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从去年开始，随着5g的普及，云电脑也开始慢慢进入人们的视野，各路大厂纷纷下场。但是一番推广之后，云电脑并没有从此兴起，实际体验中，延迟，性能和安全性都是让我们拒绝云电脑的原因。但是，在我们的实际生活中，又确实对电脑有这样的需求：像surface go一样便捷，又像全塔台式机一样性能充足……鱼和熊掌可以兼得吗？当然可以，只需要搭建一台自己的云电脑。
在一切的开始，我们需要明确云电脑的需求，是用笔记本/二合一平板代替台式机，而不是想现在大部分厂商宣传的那样用任何个人计算设备（手机、平板、电脑）替代台式机。在手机的小屏幕上操纵pc界面无论是工作还是娱乐都没有什么意义……而ipad这类连鼠标指针都没有的纯触控设备也无法担任这个角色。除开这些场景之后，用一台便携的轻薄本随时随地调用台式机的性能与体验，将是接下来阐述的主要应用场景。接下来我将从软件和硬件两方面讲解。
软件
首先是软件，实现个人搭建云电脑的关键，在于如何实现低延迟的串流。这一点parsec给出了我们很好的解决方案——p2p串流。常见的远程软件串流和云电脑串流，视频数据都要经过多个服务器的中转，就算延迟控制的较好的也是50多，想要降低延迟只能减少视频帧率。这也是为什么大部分远程软件经常会给你非常卡顿的感觉。而p2p技术则不同，可以利用全部的网络带宽，从而达到2k 60帧 20ms延迟的出色体验。这已经很接近台式机的实际操作体验了。而parsec的使用也非常简单：

访问parsec官网，注册账号。
在主机端和客户机端下载parsec软件。
登录，点击connet即可完成连接。

软件设置
由于parsec由外国公司开发，目前并没有汉化版本，所以在这里讲解一些非开箱即用的设置

在笔记本上打开client可以设置客户端配置，如decoder尽量选择独立显卡，h.265最好选择关闭，因为265的编码时长更长，会造成更高的延迟。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. What is Dask cuDF?


Dask cuDF is a library that enables users to work with large dataframes using the dask distributed computing framework. cuDF is a columnar dataframe library that is part of the NVIDIA RAPIDS initiative. Dask cuDF allows users to scale up their data processing workloads by making use of the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs.
There are several other libraries that provide similar functionality to dask cuDF. These include Apache Arrow, Pandas, and PySpark. However, dask cuDF has some advantages over these other libraries.

There are some challenges that come with using dask cuDF. One challenge is that it can be difficult to install and set up dask cuDF on your system. Another challenge is that dask cuDF is still under active development and its API may change in future releases. Finally, dask cuDF is not as welldocumented as some other libraries, making it difficult to learn how to use it effectively.
The to_csv() and from_csv() functions are the most basic ways of saving and loading dataframes. They are very simple to use and will work with any type of dataframe. However, they have some limitations. First, they can only save dataframes that fit in memory. Second, they do not support compression. Third, they are not very efficient when saving large dataframes.
If you're working with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go. It's much faster than Pandas and easier to use than Spark. So if you're looking for a better way to work with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go.

When programming in the Bash scripting language, you sometimes need to create a temporary file. For instance, you might need to have an intermediary file you can commit to disk so you can process it with another command. It's easy to create a file such as temp or anything ending in .tmp. However, those names are just as likely to be generated by some other process, so you could accidentally overwrite an existing temporary file. And besides that, you shouldn't have to expend mental effort coming up with names that seem unique. The mktemp command on Fedora-based systems and tempfile on Debian-based systems are specially designed to alleviate that burden by ma…]]></summary>

In my previous article, I discussed how to enforce best practices within your infrastructure. A site reliability engineer (SRE) is responsible for reliability, first and foremost, and enforcing policies that help keep things running is essential.
Distributed consensus
With microservices, containers, and cloud native architectures, almost every application today is going to be a distributed application. Distributed consensus is a core technology that powers distributed systems.
Distributed consensus is a protocol for building reliable distributed systems. You cannot rely on "heartbeats" (signals from your hardware or software to indicate that th…]]></summary>

我测试的片源是一部 4k 蓝光原盘电影，大概 75G 左右
电视是红米 x75 2022 款，安装了 kodi ，无论是连接 wifi 还是连接有线，都无法流畅播放
然后我外接硬盘盒，2.5 寸机械硬盘，使用小米自带的播放器，是可以流畅播放的
NAS 的千兆网口是正常驱动的，测速可以跑满
我用笔记本装了 kodi ，笔记本无论是有线还是无线，都能流畅播放 nas 里的原盘电影
也就是说，小米自带的播放器，还有小米上安装的 kodi ，都有流畅播放这部 4k 影片的能力，问题就出现在网络传输上
电视是百兆网口，百兆网口的带宽无法满足流畅原盘播放？
电视的 wifi 也很弱，我用小米电视自带的网速测试工具，和有线差不多
虽然我的 NAS 已经通过 jellyfin 硬解，可以在网页流畅的看这部影片了
但是这台电视，是不是就根本没办法流畅的直接播放 NAS 里的原盘电影？]]></summary>

LibreOffice 提供了多种样式，你可以使用它们来创建各种内容。 LibreOffice 将段落样式应用于文本块，例如正文、列表和代码示例。字符样式类似，只是这些样式适用于段落内的内联词或其他短文本。使用“视图View -> 样式Styles”菜单，或使用 F11 键盘快捷键，调出样式选择器。



使用样式可以更轻松地编写更长的文档。看看这个例子：作为咨询实践的一部分，我写了很多工作簿和培训材料。一个工作簿可能有 40 或 60 页长，具体取决于主题，并且可以包含各种内容，例如正文、表格和列表。我的一些技术培训材料可能还包括源代码示例。

我有一个提供给客户的标准培训集，但我也做定制的培训计划。在处理自定义程序时，我可能会先从另一个工作簿导入文本，然后从那里开始工作。根据客户的不同，我可能还会调整字体和其他样式元素以匹配客户的样式偏好。对于其他材料，我可能需要添加源代码示例。

要使用直接格式输入示例源代码，我需要设置字体并调整工作簿中每个代码块的边距。如果我后来决定我的工作簿应该对正文文本或源代码示例使用不同的字体，我需要返回并更改所有内容。对于包含多个代码示例的工作簿，这可能需要几个小时来查找每个源代码示例并调整字体和边距以匹配新的首选格式。

但是，通过使用样式，我可以更新定义一次，为正文样式使用不同的字体，并且 LibreOffice Writer 会在所有使用正文样式的地方更新我的文档。同样，我可以调整预格式化文本样式的字体和边距，LibreOffice Writer 会将这种新样式应用到每个具有预格式化文本样式的源代码示例中。这对于其他文本块也是如此，包括标题、源代码、列表以及页眉和页脚。

我最近有了一个好主意，更新 LibreOffice 键盘快捷键以简化我的写作过程。我重新定义了 Ctrl + B 设置加粗强调字符样式，Ctrl + I 设置强调字符样式，Ctrl + 空格 设置取消字符样式。这使我的写作变得更加容易，因为我不必暂停写作，这样我就可以高亮显示一些文本并选择一种新的风格。相反，我可以使用新的 Ctrl + I 键盘快捷键来设置字符样式，它本质上是斜体文本。之后我输入的任何内容都使用强调样式，直到我按 Ctrl + 空格 将字符样式重置为默认的无字符样式。



如果你想自己设置的，请使用“工具Tools -> 自定义Customize”， 然后单击“键盘Keyboard”选项卡以修改键盘快捷键。



LibreOffice 通过样式使技术写作变得更加容易。通过利用键盘快捷键，我简化了我的写作方式，让我专注于我要交付的内容，而不是它的外观。稍后我可能会更改格式，但样式保持不变。

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。 
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

当 Notion 遇到游戏，你觉得会撞出怎样的火花？在我这里，两者撞出了一个游戏库。
作为一个游戏爱好者，我发现自己总会被那些小巧的游戏作品吸引到。比如玩家们口中常说的独立游戏、或是那些诞生于 GameJam 的作品。
所谓 GameJam，可以理解为一种快节奏、鼓励创意表达的游戏开发活动，参加者或单人或组队抱团，需要在指定时间内从零开始制作出一个游戏，尽可能在游戏中表达一个特定的主题（通常由活动举办方指定），最终评选出优秀作品。（详情可以参考叶梓涛的 这篇介绍）
我曾在一次线下的游戏展会试玩过 GameJam 中诞生的作品，虽然完成度很难比得上 Steam 上陈列的那些游戏，但大多有巧妙的玩法设计，时不时就能遇到眼前一亮的宝藏作品，让我惊呼于开发者的创意和才能。
但线下的展会终归是有限制的，受限于路程、开放时间、人流量等各种因素，我很难自由试玩自己感兴趣的游戏，这也给我埋下了遗憾，总是忍不住关注类似的 GameJam 活动，想着多玩一些活动中诞生的游戏，但又会因各种原因无法如愿。
直到前不久，我在 机核网 的 App 里看到在推送一个叫 BOOOM 的活动，我突然回想起来，这就是那个给我埋下遗憾的 GameJam。我一个激动，便给自己定下了「体验完所有游戏」的目标。
但要体验所有的游戏，首先我得知道总共有哪些，这样才能持续追踪进度。经过随后的一系列折腾，我成功在当天内搭建好了一个 Notion 游戏库，收录完了这届 BOOOM 中所有游戏的信息。

概述
目前flutter越来越受欢迎，但对于一些成熟的产品来说，完全摒弃原有App全面转向Flutter是不现实的。因此使用Flutter去统一Android、iOS技术栈，把它作为已有原生App的扩展能力，通过有序推进来提升移动终端的开发效率。 目前，想要在已有的原生App里嵌入一些Flutter页面主要有两种方案。一种是将原生工程作为Flutter工程的子工程，由Flutter进行统一管理，这种模式称为统一管理模式。另一种是将Flutter工程作为原生工程的子模块，维持原有的原生工程管理方式不变，这种模式被称为三端分离模式，如下图所示。

三端代码分离模式的原理是把Flutter模块作为原生工程的子模块，从而快速地接入Flutter模块，降低原生工程的改造成本。
如何在Native项目中接入flutter 模块
在原生项目中集成flutter模块有两种方式，第一种是直接在项目中新建一个flutter module,第二种将flutter项目模块打包成aar或so包集成到Native项目中。一下将详细介绍这两种方式 (以Android为例)
采用module引用的方式
直接通过Android stuido
File->New ->New Module 选择 Flutter Module 来生成一个Flutter Module.


如下图：Android studio为原生项目创建了一个module

手动创建Flutter module
假设你在 some/path/MyApp 路径下已有一个 Android 应用，并且你希望 Flutter 项目作为同级项目：
 cd some/path/
$ flutter create -t module --org com.example my_flutter

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7-Zip 是用于 Windows、Mac 和 Linux 的知名开源文件归档器。它的最新版本 22.00 现已推出。它是 2022 年的第一个稳定版本。上一个版本是 21.07，于 2021 年 12 月发布。7-Zip 的用户可以从官方网站获取该应用的最新版本，下载适用于 Windows 64 位、32 位和 ARM 版本。该应用仍然与过时的 Windows 版本兼容，例如 XP 和 Vista。它还支持所有官方支持的 Windows 版本，包括服务器版本。适用于 Linux 的 7-Zip 22.00 已经可以下载，但 Mac OS 版本还不可用。

7-Zip 22.00 包含一些增强了应用功能的新特性。这个归档器现在支持提取苹果文件系统Apple File System（APFS）镜像。几年前，苹果公司在 Mac OS 10.13 和 iOS 中引入了苹果文件系统。该文件系统在设计时就考虑到了闪存（Flash）和固态硬盘（SSD）存储。

7-Zip 22.00 包括了对其 TAR 存档支持的多项增强。使用选项 -ttar -mm=pax 或 -ttar -mm=posix，7-Zip 现在可以创建符合 POSIX 标准的 tar 格式的 TAR 档案。此外，使用选项 ttar -mm=pax -mtp=3 -mtc -mta，7-Zip 可以在 tar/pax 存档中存储高精度的文件时间戳。

最后，Linux 用户可以在 TAR 归档文件中使用以下两个新选项：


snoi：将所有者/组 ID 保存在存档中，或将所有者/组 ID 从存档复制到提取的文件中。

snon：在存档中保留所有者/组的名称。


适用于 Windows 的 7-Zip 22.00 添加了对 -snz 选项的支持，该选项用于传播区识别符（LCTT 译注：区标识符是微软在 2013 年为 IE 设计的安全功能，它会标记那些用户自网络上所下载的文件，并在用户准备打开时跳出警告）。

要提取文件，请使用标识符流。出于安全目的，Windows 使用了该流，它可用于确定文件是在本地创建的还是从互联网下载的。

在“添加到存档add to archive”配置对话框中，7-Zip 22.00 包含一个新的选项窗口。它包括用于更改时间戳精度、更改其他与时间相关的配置选项，以及防止更改源文件的最后访问时间等选项。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[正如 Linus Torvalds 所暗示，Linux Kernel 5.20 发布时可能会提供对 Rust 的支持。你怎么看？




市面上已经有许多用 Rust 重写的开源项目。因此，如今 Rust 被认为是 Linux 内核的第二语言，也就不足为奇了。

几天前，在 Linux 基金会开源峰会 上，Linus Torvals 提到他们预计将在下一个内核版本（即 Linux 内核 5.20）中对 Rust 进行试验。

或许你不知道，正如 Phoronix 率先报道的那样，Linux 已经有了 Rust 内核补丁，包含了少量的示例驱动程序，以及基本的基础设施的启用代码。

因此，Linus Torvalds 对可能合并 Rust 支持的暗示，也不足为奇。但是，这无疑是令人兴奋的！

用于 Linux 内核的 Rust

这么做的最终目标是让 Linux 内核变得更好，但它现在仍然处于试运行阶段。

凭借其各种优势，Rust 正日益成为一种流行的编程语言。还记得吗，System76 也在开发一个用 Rust 编写的新桌面环境。

然而，并不是所有参与维护 Linux 内核的人都熟悉这种编程语言。

那么，这会是一个问题吗？

Linus Torvalds 并不认为这是一个大问题，因为内核中也有其他语言。他还提到希望看到 Rust 成为新的一份子。

The Register 报道称，Linus Torvalds 表示会信任维护者，除非他们犯了错误。

Linux 5.20：何时发布？

Linux 内核 5.19 版本将于 7 月底左右发布。因此，5.20 版本的合并窗口应该会在其稳定版发布后开启（假设没有意外延迟的话）。

除了 Rust 以外，Linux 内核 5.20 应该也是对包括 RDNA3 在内的下一代硬件支持的重要更新，它同时提供了更多功能。

你如何看待 Rust 将在不久的将来进入 Linux 呢？你感到兴奋吗？欢迎在下方评论区告诉我们～

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
我会用两篇文章来讲透声明式 UI，分别是《给移动开发者的声明式 UI 入门手册》，《UI 开发的革命，声明式 UI 到底好在哪里？》，今天这篇文章是第一篇，第二篇什么时候能发出还不确定，欢迎关注本公众号：FlutterFirst 以及时接收推送。
命令式 UI 的由来
和声明式 UI 相对应的是命令式 UI，也就是我们传统的 UI 编程模式。
在声明式 UI（响应式 UI）这个概念还没出现之前，我们似乎并没有将其称作命令式 UI。它好像是为了甄别两者的不同而凭空造出的概念。
在我看来，命令式 UI 是由面向对象编程思想自然而然的演化出来的。面向对象编程思想讲究封装，继承和多态。这三大特性在命令式 UI 中表现得淋漓尽致。我们来分析一下：
封装
任何 UI 系统的核心职责是测量、布局、绘制和事件反馈。测量是为了计算出 UI 元素的大小，布局是为了计算出 UI 元素在屏幕中的摆放位置。绘制是为了将 UI 元素真正呈现到屏幕上，事件反馈是为了监听来自 UI 系统内部或外部的事件来更新 UI，串联用户的交互流程以完成用户的工作。
我们将界面中的元素封装成 View，让其承担上述四个职责。比如在 Android 中，onMeasure、onLayout、onDraw、onTouchEvent 都是 View 类的方法。
继承
UI 元素的种类是丰富的，比如按钮、文本、图片、进度条、单选框、复选框、SeekBar、下拉刷新、列表等等。我们不可能让一个 View 承担所有的功能，因此我们通过继承 View，重写部分核心职责方法来让不同的 View 承担不同的功能，基本上做到一个 View 只干一件事情。
这里仍然会涉及到封装，因为不同的 View 会有不同的属性。这些属性体现在成员变量上。
多态
多态在 UI 系统中体现得不多，最普遍的场景是对于某个 View，当对它进行测量时，如…]]></summary>

Facebook’s app for smart TVs, which lets users tune into various videos, shows, and livestreams on the platform, may no longer be available on Apple TV, as first reported by 9to5Mac. Some users say they’re no longer able to access the app after its most recent update.
In a thread on MacRumors, one user shares an image of the notice they received after attempting to open Facebook Watch on their Apple TV 4K: “The Facebook Watch TV app is no longer available, but you can still find lots of videos on Facebook at www.facebook.com/watch.” Several other users report having the same experience.
Facebook rolled out its Watch app on Apple TV in 2017 after first launching it on Samsung smart TVs. The app is also available on various other smart TVs...

Riot Games, the developer behind the free first-person shooter (FPS) Valorant, will start monitoring players’ voice communications on July 13th (via PCGamer). The game company says it’s to help train the language models that it will eventually use when evaluating player reports across all its games.
Riot initially announced this change in April 2021 after making an update to its privacy policy. The new terms give Riot permission to “record and potentially evaluate voice data when using Riot-owned voice comms channels” with the purpose of combatting hate speech and harassment over voice chat. Riot says it will analyze recordings when a player reports someone for abusive or offensive comments. In turn, this should help the company...

App合规现在是越来越严了，也越来越多App被通报，为了能隐私合规呢，我对公司App也进行很多的整改。其中最主要的是通过ASM字节码去拦截第三方库频繁调用隐私方法的问题。
主要思路就是找到第三方库频繁调用隐私方法的方法，将其替换成我们自己的方法。AsmActualCombat项目地址：https://github.com/Peakmain/AsmActualCombat
那今天呢，讲的是对Glide进行封装，移除User-Agent，相当来说简单多了，主要要熟悉代码
背景：我们公司App加载网络图片时候，App移动应用检测的时候说我们应用自身获取个人信息行为，描述说的是我们有图片上传行为，看了堆栈，主要问题是加载图片的时候，user-Agent有读取设备型号行为

于是我就猜测是Glide在加载网络的时候，它内部设置了User-Agent，那就让我们一起来验证咋们的猜测吧。
源码
Glide的简单使用
Glide.with(imageView.getContext().getApplicationContext()).asDrawable().load(url).into(imageView);

因为我们主要想知道加载图片的时候是否设置了User-Agent，那肯定就是主要看加载图片时的into源码
into源码
  public ViewTarget into(@NonNull ImageView view) {
    Util.assertMainThread();
    Preconditions.checkNotNull(view);
    RequestOptions requestOptions = this.requestOptions;

Apple’s poised to release a slew of new devices between this fall and the beginning of 2023, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. What Gurman describes as a “deluge” of products will reportedly include four iPhone 14 devices, a set of new iPads, three Apple Watches, several M2 / M3-upgraded Macs, a pair of refreshed AirPods Pro buds, a new HomePod, and a spec-boosted Apple TV model.
Let’s break down these predictions. 
Although Apple announced two new Macs with its flagship M2 processor at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this month, Gurman expects to find the chip — and its variations — in several other devices. This includes an M2 Mac mini, M2 Pro Mac mini, M2 Pro / M2 Max 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros,...

前言
作为一个Android开发，每天都会有相当一部分的时间花在编译打包上，如果项目比较大的话编译一次可能就要十几分钟。
那么在编译打包的过程中AGP到底做了什么？为什么编译那么耗时，又该怎么优化？要解决这些问题，首先就需要我们对编译打包的流程有个总体的了解
本文主要包括以下内容
编译打包总体流程
编译打包主要步骤
编译打包过程中的Task
编译打包总体流程
首先看下Android官网给出的编译打包总体流程

典型 Android 应用的构建流程如图所示，主要分为以下几步：
编译器将您的源代码转换成 DEX 文件（Dalvik 可执行文件，其中包括在 Android 设备上运行的字节码），并将其他所有内容转换成编译后的资源。
打包器将 DEX 文件和编译后的资源组合成 APK 或 AAB（具体取决于所选的 build 目标）。
打包器使用调试或发布密钥库为 APK 或 AAB 签名。
在生成最终 APK 之前，打包器会使用 zipalign 工具对应用进行优化，以减少其在设备上运行时所占用的内存
编译打包主要步骤
关于Android编译打包还有一张更加复杂的图

这个看起来是相当复杂的，但其实我们也可以把这些步骤做一个分类，跟总体流程的四个步骤做一个对应
资源与代码编译
资源文件编译
apk资源包含:
工程中res目录下的所有文件
assets目录下的文件
AndroidManifest.xml
apk的资源编译是编译过程中的一项主要工作，AGP3.0.0之后默认通过AAPT2来编译资源。
AAPT2（Android Asset Packaging Tool2）是一种构建工具，Android Studio 和 Android Gradle 插件使用它来编译和打包应用的资源。AAPT2 会解析资源、为…]]></summary>

Apple’s mixed reality headset has been shrouded in rumors for months now, and a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman indicates that it could come with Apple’s flagship M2 processor. According to Gurman, Apple’s most recent version of the device, which is reportedly capable of delivering augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences,  includes a base M2 chip and 16GB of RAM.
This deviates from supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s previous prediction that Apple’s headset will have one processor with the capabilities of an M1 chip and an additional lower-end processor dedicated to handling data from the device’s sensors. While Gurman doesn’t mention the purported secondary chip in this report, a multiple chip setup has also...

3亿美元的 bug
假设有这样一个方法：
interface Timer{
    fun delay(long: Long, block: () -> Long)
}

从方法声明可以猜出功能是“延迟long后执行block，并且要求 block 返回一个 Long。”
至于延迟的是秒还是毫秒？block 的返回值表示什么意思？不得而知。
不得不查看接口实现类：
class Timer1 : Timer{
    override fun delay(long: Long, block: () -> Long) {
        handler.postDelayed({
            val seconds = block()
            print(seconds)
        }, long)
    }
}

从 Timer1 的实现可以得知，时间间隔是毫秒，而 block 返回值是秒。
但项目中可能同时存在下面这样的实现：
class Timer2 : Timer {
    override fun delay(long: Long, block: () -> Long) {
        GlobalScope.launch {
            delay(long.toDuration(DurationUnit.SECONDS))
            val milliseconds = block()
            print(milliseconds)
        }
    }
}

此时，时间间隔是秒，而 block 返回值是毫秒。
这就很头痛了，因为使用 Timer 接口时，不知道该如何传参。
理论上接口是一种抽象，在使用它时不需要关心内部实…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[jary，货拉拉高级客户端工程师，目前负责货拉拉App Android端稳定性提升，包体积优化相关工作。
前言
随着公司业务的扩展，货拉拉用户端apk包的体积也不断变大，过去一年，用户端android组进行了大量的瘦身工作，取得了较为显著的成果。再使用常规方法，已经很难优化包体积了。
我们可以把一些使用频率相对较低的资源不打包进apk，并在需要时下载到本地（例如动画文件，字体，zip压缩包，so库等）
我们注意到，货拉拉用户端apk中，使用了35个以上的so库，并且都支持arm64-v8a和armeabi-v7a这2种abi，结果就是so体积成倍上涨。用户端生产环境下的apk，解压缩后，存放so包的lib目录，占据了整个应用41%的大小。
因此动态资源管理系统是下一个优化的重点，动画，字体和zip包只是普通文件，完全可以支持动态下载并使用。而so文件本质上就是一种可动态加载并执行的文件，将 so文件动态下发是切实可行的，但是要将它从 apk中剔除并保证稳定性并不是一件易事。
行业方案
未找到现成的github项目或者三方sdk方案，来实现动态资源管理。
部分博客提供了动态管理so文件的思路，但是缺少完整流程。
行业目前并未提供完整的成熟方案供我们使用，需要我们自己造轮子。
功能和方案
实现功能
资源分类，预定义了字体，帧动画，so这3种内置资源，以及单个文件，多个文件这2种可自定义资源。
提供通用的加载动态资源方法，所有资源均可由此加载。
内置资源，提供默认的应用方法，外部可以直接应用。自定义资源，用户自行决定如何应用。
对于所有资源，提供可配置的方便快捷打包方式，减少手动操作。

几个概念
资源加载：将动态资源通过下载，校验，解压等方式，映射到本地文件的过程。
该过程对所有资源通用，sdk使用方无需修改资源加载方式。
资源应用：动态资源对应的本地文件应用到具体业务中。例如…]]></summary>

        <id>https://sspai.com/post/74000</id>
        <link href="https://sspai.com/post/74000"/>
        <updated>2022-06-26T15:40:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、背景介绍
相信有不少朋友遇到过这样的烦恼，Windows 笔记本有几个按键坏了，笔记本又刚好过了保修期。拿到售后一问，好家伙，修笔记本的薄膜键盘要一百多的维修费。而一百多已经可以买一把机械键盘了，隐隐约约觉得这笔维修费很不值，但是那失灵的几个按键又很膈应。
本篇文章就尝试为这样的烦恼提供解决思路，除了可以使用 PowerToys 解决外，还会列出一些备选方案。

二、解决思路
（一）使用 PowerToys 解决
1.PowerToys 介绍

又有谁能比 Microsoft 更懂 Windows 呢？
——《少数派 2021 年度应用出炉，这些 App 是我们的「年度之选」》

PowerToys 可以算是 Windows 官方出品的”外挂“或者”瑞士军刀“，其中有很多可以帮助用户提高 Windows 使用效率的功能，本篇文章就是使用键盘管理器功能。
PowerToys 的键盘管理器功能
2.使用指南
读者可以看看键盘上的 F 键，能回想起来上一次使用这些 F 键是什么时候吗？没错，可以尝试把失灵的按键重映射到不常用的 F 键上解决问题。
重映射键
比如说笔记本键盘字母区域上面的数字键”9“坏了，而”F9“键又刚刚好在”9“键的上面，所以我把物理键”9“映射到”F9“。
重映射键”F9“至”9“
现在，理论上问题已经解决了，当我按下”F9“就能完成如下的输入：
F9 = 9
Shift + F9 = Shift + 9 = （
没错，重映射键之后相应的组合键也是生效的！
3.提醒
有读者可能感到疑惑，我的”9“键都坏了，那在重映射键界面怎么输入”9“呢？
好问题，其实在首次设置的时候还是要外接一块正常的键盘的，不过这应该是可以办得到的吧。首次设置好之后，只需保持 PowerToys 的启动时运行为开启状态，那么理论上设置的重映射将一直生效。
其次，虽然说 F 键有 12 个，理论上笔记本键盘允许坏掉的按键也有 12 个，但是我觉得坏键个数的容忍范围大约在九个左右，因为还是有几个 F 键挺常用的。比如：
F2：文件重命名
F5：刷新或者编程工具的快捷键
F12：网页的检查
这几个比较常用的 F 键不建议设置重映射。当然，其实能通过键盘管理器的重新映射快捷键解决，甚至使用重新映射快捷键还能映射远多于 12 个的失灵按键，但是到了这个阶段，还是建议直接更换键盘了。
重映射快捷键
（二）使用屏幕键盘解决（备选方案）
屏幕键盘
（三）使用 AutoHotkey 或者 AutoIt（备选方案）
其实这类热键脚本语言程序不是那么推荐，因为要进行一定的编程。既然都通过热键解决了，为什么不用 PowerToys 的重映射键呢？
（四）自己更换笔记本键盘（备选方案）
其实键盘维修的物料费往往在一百元以下，剩下的都是人工费。想节省人工费自己更换键盘，其实并没有想象中那么难，先仔细检索查阅教程，跟着教程一步一步操作通常还是能成功的。
比如我就在发现已经有 12 个按键坏掉之后，自己动手更换了笔记本的键盘，甚至还记录下了一篇教程《小米 Air 13.3 拆机换键盘步骤》。

三、结语
PowerToys 的键盘管理器能做到的不只是重映射失灵的按键，少数派文章《6 个实用技巧和软件，让你的 Windows 11 更加称心如意》就介绍了如何借助 PowerToys 的快捷键重映射处理烦人的 Teams 和小组件，而且少数派中有不少文章介绍 PowerToys 的其他强大功能。

My definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.
我对智慧的定义是知道你的行动的长期后果。应用于外部问题的智慧就是判断力。它们（智慧与判断力）是高度相关的；知道你的行动的长期后果，然后利用它来做出正确的决策。（我自己翻译的，非中文版原文） #智慧

看到这段话，我有一种开悟的感觉。
智慧，它是不可名状的。就像老子说：道可道，非常道。关于智慧，如果说我们有哪些共识的话，其中一点会是：长者拥有更…]]></summary>

Back in November 2009, I was getting ready to attend the Montreal International Games Summit, and I panicked — it was my first major event as a member of the press, and I had no way to record an interview. This was a problem because I was scheduled to talk with Yoichi Wada, then president of Square Enix, along with several other notable industry people. So I rushed to Radio Shack and picked the cheapest voice recorder I could find, a little grey rectangle made by RCA that was locked up in a glass display case. I have no idea what model it is, but it went on to follow me through my entire professional career to date — now, nearly 13 years later, it’s finally being retired.
I hung on to that gadget for one main reason: I trusted it. The...

Spotify has a brand new original topping its podcast chart, but it would probably prefer if you didn’t know about it. 
Last week, Spotify launched a new pop culture show, Breaking Bread, on Spotify Live. Breaking Bread’s recordings now rank at number 11 on Spotify’s top podcast chart after holding the number two spot for most of the week, putting it just behind Joe Rogan. The show’s popularity — and the reason the company might be staying quiet about its new hit — is due to its two hosts: Jackie Oshry Weinreb and Claudia Oshry (aka Instagram’s girlwithnojob), who come with a huge built-in audience. While the sisters have delivered their massive fanbase to the app, they have a controversial history that could be problematic for Spotify at...

hello 大家好，我是《Flutter 开发实战详解》的作者，Github GSY 项目的负责人郭树煜，同时也是今年新晋的 Flutter GDE，借着本次 Google  I/O 之后发布的 Flutter 3.0，来和大家聊一聊 Flutter 里混合开发的技术演进。
为什么混合开发在 Flutter 里是特殊的存在？因为它渲染的控件是通过 Skia 直接和 GPU 交互，也就是说 Flutter 控件和平台无关，甚至连 UI 绘制线程都和原生平台 UI 线程是相互独立，所以甚至于 Flutter  在诞生之初都不支持和原生平台的控件进行混合开发，也就是不支持 WebView ，这就成了当时最大的缺陷之一 。
其实从渲染的角度看 Flutter 更像是一个 2D 游戏引擎，事实上 Flutter 在这次 Google I/O 也分享了基于 Flutter 的游戏开发 ToolKit 和第三方工具包 Flame ，如图所示就是本次 Google I/O 发布的 Pinball 小游戏，所以从这些角度上看都可以看出 Flutter 在混合开发的特殊性。
如果说的更形象简单一点，那就是如何把原生控件渲染到 WebView 里。

最初的社区支持
不支持   WebView  在最初可以说是 Flutter 最大的痛点之一，所以在这样窘迫的情况下，社区里涌现出一些临时的解决方法，比如 flutter_webview_plugin 。
类似  flutter_webview_plugin  的出现，解决了当时大部分时候 App 里打开一个网页的简单需求，如下图所示，它的思路就是：
在 Flutter 层面放一个占位控件提供大小，然后原生层在同样的位置把  WebView 添加进去，从而达到看起来把  WebView  集成进去的效果，这个思路在…]]></summary>

My review of the M2 MacBook Pro went up last Wednesday. But as soon as I got my hands on the device on the prior Thursday, it was clear that running down the battery — one of the most important things a laptop reviewer needs to do — was going to be a Whole Thing. 
Reader, I tried. I would use the device all evening and leave it running all night, but it would still have plenty of charge left in the morning, and I’d have to plug it in for testing, abandon it to film, or give it to our video and photo teams for shooting before I could fully drain it down. I did not have a long enough interrupted span of time to continuously use the device. That’s how absurdly long this laptop lasts. 
But, with the written review and the video review both...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetHack 被列入现代艺术博物馆藏品

NetHack 被列入了纽约现代艺术博物馆收藏。它被建筑和设计馆选定为其小型电子游戏收藏品，并作为今年秋天的“永不孤独”展览的一部分展出。NetHack 最初是 1982 年的地下城探索游戏“Hack”（它基于 1980 年的游戏 Rogue）的一个复刻版本，它影响了日后的《暗黑破坏神》和《火炬之光》。它是仍在活动的最古老的开源项目之一，实际上比“开源”一词（当时叫“自由软件”），甚至 GPL 都早了几年。它也是最早的，甚至是第一个完全通过互联网，由分布在世界各地的团队开发的软件项目之一（“NetHack”中的“Net”因此而来）。


消息来源：Linkedin



老王点评：“上古时代”的网游，这是真正的老游戏和开源鼻祖。它也有很多衍生版本，大家感兴趣的可以看看。




Linus Torvalds 反对用 -O3 优化编译内核

之前我们 报道 过，有开发者提出了补丁，可以在所有 CPU 架构上启用 -O3 的优化参数来编译内核，而之前该 Kconfig 参数只在 ARC 架构上可用。Linus Torvalds 对此的看法是，他实际上反对有这样一个 Kconfig 选项。他需要被一些真实的、现实世界的数据所说服，以显示其好处。当然，感兴趣的人即便没有这个 Kconfig 选项，也可以为编译器添加类似选项而做到 -O3 优化。但 Linus 也指出，“在生成糟糕的代码方面，-O3 有更多的黑历史。最好干脆移除这个选项。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：过度优化显然是个错误，Linus 和内核社区还是一如既往的保守持重。不过我觉得，作为实验性的选项，完全可以更开放一些，或许真的能对内核和编译器优化有所改进。




Fedora CoreOS 有望提升为官方版本

Fedora CoreOS 是一个自动更新、最小化的操作系统，用于容器工作负载，其目标是结合 CoreOS Container Linux 和 Fedora Atomic Host 的最佳特性。早在 Fedora 34 开发周期中，Fedora CoreOS 的开发者希望能够晋升为官方版本。现在反馈的问题已经得到解决，有望在 Fedora 37 中升级为和工作站、服务器和 IoT 构建并列的官方版本。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：再加上这个容器版本，Fedora 的各个官方产品线就齐全了。]]></summary>

开源的 PDF 阅读和编辑工具通常比 &ldquoDF 编辑器” 搜索结果第一页中的应用更安全和可靠。在那里，你很可能看到带有隐藏的限制和关税的专有应用，缺乏关于数据保护政策和托管的足够信息。你可以有更好的。

这里有五个应用，可以安装在你的 Linux 系统上（和其他系统）或托管在服务器上。每一个都是自由而开源的，具有创建、编辑和注释 PDF 文件的所有必要功能。

LibreOffice

使用 LibreOffice 套件，你对应用的选择取决于最初的任务。虽然文字处理器 LibreOffice Writer，可以让你创建 PDF 文件，并从 ODF 和其他文本格式导出，但 Draw 更适合于处理现有的 PDF 文件。

Draw 是用来创建和编辑图形文件的，如小册子、杂志和海报。因此，其工具集主要用于视觉对象和布局上。然而，对于 PDF 编辑，当文件具有可编辑属性时，LibreOffice Draw 提供了用于修改和添加 PDF 内容的工具。如果没有的话，你仍然可以在现有的内容层上添加新的文本字段，并对文件进行注释或完成。

Draw 和 Writer 都被捆绑在 LibreOffice 桌面套件中，可在 Linux 系统、macOS 和 Windows 上安装。

ONLYOFFICE Docs

ONLYOFFICE 一直在改进 PDF 的处理，并在 ONLYOFFICE Docs 的 7.1 版本中引入了一个全新的 PDF 和电子书的阅读器。

该文档编辑器允许从头开始创建 PDF 文件，使用 DOCX 作为文件的基础，然后可以转换为 PDF 或 PDF/A。通过内置的表单创建功能，ONLYOFFICE Docs 还可以建立可填充的文档模板，并将其导出…]]></summary>

Accessibility is key to promoting an open society.
We learn online. We bank online. Political movements are won and lost online. Most importantly, the information we access online inspires us to make a better world. When we ignore accessibility requirements, people born without sight or who lost limbs in war are restricted from online information that others enjoy.
We must ensure that everyone has access to the open internet, and I am doing my part to work toward that goal by building Equalify.
What is Equalify?

在下面的屏幕截屏中，你可以看到，我有两个可用的 VLC 版本，我使用命令来安装较旧的版本：



听起来像一个简单的任务，对吧？但是事情并非看起来那么简单。这里有一些不确定是否会出现，但是可能会涉及的东西。

这篇教程将涵盖使用 apt 或 apt-get 命令来安装一个具体指定的程序的版本的所有的重要的方面。

安装一个具体指定版本的程序需要知道的事

在基于 Ubuntu 和 Debian 发行版中，你需要知道一些关于 APT 和存储库是如何工作的知识。

同一个软件包源没有较旧的版本

Ubuntu 在其存储库中不保留较旧版本的软件包。在特殊的情况下，你可以暂时性地看到多个版本。例如，你运行 APT 更新（但不升级）时，可能会有一个可用的新版本。在 APT 缓存中，你可以看到同一个软件包的两个版本。但是，一旦软件包被升级到了新的版本，较旧版本的软件包将从 APT 缓存 和存储库中移除。

使用多个软件包源来使用不同的版本

为获取同一个的软件包的多个版本，你必须得添加多个软件包源。例如，VLC 是版本 3.x 系列。添加 VLC 每日构建 PPA 将会提供（不稳定的）版本 4.x 系列。

同样，你可以下载不同版本的 DEB 文件，并安装它。

较高版本编号的版本通常有优先权

如果你有来自多个软件包源的相同名称的软件，默认情况下，Ubuntu 将安装可用的最高版本编号的版本。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[theme: cyanosis
本文主要讲述在 Flutter 项目中如何实现将文件上传到华为 OBS（对象存储）中，并封装为三方库方便灵活使用。
背景介绍
在大多项目中都会存在文件上传的需求，之前的实现都是调用后台的文件上传接口将文件上传到服务器上，但是这样会存在一个问题，因为文件上传会占用带宽导致在文件上传中调用其他接口的时候就会存在访问慢的情况，解决方案当然是升级带宽或者单独使用一台服务器作为文件服务，而且要带宽足够大不然上传下载的时候会很慢，但是这样两种方案成本都比较高。随着云计算的到来，各大云服务商都提供了对象存储的服务，费用便宜、带宽高、不影响业务系统而且提供了很多附加功能，比如图片处理、图片鉴黄等功能。
因目前在做的项目甲方爸爸明确要求云服务要使用华为云，所以对象存储服务也必须使用华为云的 OBS 服务，而为了节约人力成本移动端使用的是 Flutter 跨平台开发，所以就有了本篇文章标题的需求，需要在 Flutter 中实现将文件上传到华为云 OBS 中，而华为云 OBS 并没有提供 Flutter SDK，所以就需要自己实现，首先看一下实现以后的代码使用效果。
使用
目前只封装了两个简单的功能：上传对象、上传文件。
首先在项目的 pubspec.yaml 里添加依赖，如下：
  flutter_hw_obs:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/loongwind/flutter_hw_obs.git
      ref: 0.0.3

然后在使用的地方引入obs_client包：
import 'package:flutter_hw_obs/obs_client.dart';

初始化
调用 OBSClient.init 进行初始化。
OBSClient.init("${AccessKey}", "${Secret…]]></summary>

文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

我们身边总有那么几位朋友饱受腰酸背痛的困扰，或因久坐、或因运动，不一而足；大家通常的解决办法是「做按摩」，但很多人都对于「做按摩」这是抱有抵触，一是由于种种因素对于按摩店带有偏见，二是讳疾忌医，潜意识里认为自己没病不需要做按摩。其实我们都需要定期做做按摩以舒缓疲惫的身躯，特别是经常运动的健儿和常年对着电脑的社畜们，科学的保养我们的身体才是正确的选择。
按摩也分流派，东西方各有学问
按摩也是有学问的，作为一个每年骑行上万、跑步上千、游泳数百还常年坐电脑前的半吊子铁三选手对此还是略有体会，常年久坐的人需要的按摩和运动后的按摩是不一样的，前者是中国传统的推拿按摩，后者是排酸按摩。
中国传统推拿按摩常见于高端会所和路边小店，遵循的是所谓的经络理论，也就是俗称的奇经八脉。手法以按、捏、压为主，过程中往往伴随着惨叫，因为真的很疼，这种对于久坐办公族的腰酸背痛还是有效果的。
图源：中国中医药出版社《国家标准经穴部位挂图》
而运动后的排酸和中国推拿不太一样，国内比较少见，有时能在一些纪录片、特别是自行车赛的纪录片中看到，他们的手法以揉搓为主，自行车运动员刮腿毛的一个原因就是避免在赛后按摩的时候被拽掉。同时，这还涉及到一个时下经常被谈及的词——筋膜，筋膜是缠绕在肌肉和韧带关节上的结缔组织，就是在做菜处理肉制品时常常会撕下的那层白色黏膜。
有过经验的都会用「酸爽」来形容这个过程，因为真的是又「酸痛」又「爽」，疼痛是实打实的，但在疼痛之后又有一种莫名的舒爽，甚至光是看这个过程都会很解压。在某视频网站上，有位健身博主就靠着发「享受」按摩师折磨的视…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub Copilot 来了，它能帮助程序员，为他们提供人工智能的编码建议，不过，它是否会让事情变得更糟呢？




在 2021 年，我曾花了好几个小时来翻阅 GitHub Copilot 文档，试图弄清楚如何能够加入它的技术预览计划。还好，这一切都得到了回报，我成功加入了预览计划。

而现在，它终于可供所有人使用啦！

如果你还不知道的话，GitHub Copilot 是一个 AI 助手，可帮助你更快、更高效地编写代码。

我能想到的最类似的东西，就是你手机上的（输入法的）自动完成功能。不过，与自动完成功能不同，GitHub Copilot 编写代码，就相当于是在完成整段的句子。

Copilot 现已可供大众使用

正如我在前面提到的，Copilot 已经处于技术预览阶段将近一年了。这意味着，GitHub 只允许非常有限数量的开发者免费使用它，以换取同意 GitHub 监控他们的使用情况，从而改进程序的最终版本。

看起来 GitHub 终于满意地向公众发布了它。现在，任何拥有 GitHub 帐户的人都应该能够使用它，尽管需要付出一定的代价（我很快就会在下面提到）。

公告 中提到：


直到不久前，人工智能都没有能够帮助改进代码，开发软件的过程几乎完全是手动的。现在，这种情况正在改变。今天，我很高兴地宣布，我们正在向所有个人开发者提供 GitHub Copilot。你的 AI 配对程序员来啦。

—— Thomas Dohmke，GitHub CEO


Copilot 作为免费的编辑器扩展，已经帮助数百万开发者加快了他们的编程速度。然而，它确实是有代价的，无论是直接的还是间接的。

GitHub Copilot 定价

与几乎所有令人兴奋的新技术一样，Copilot 对某些人来说可能过于昂贵。它将花费你 10 美元/月或 100 美元/年。

如果你是开源项目维护者或经过验证的学生，那么你可以免费使用它。

GitHub Copilot 不道德吗？

围绕 GitHub Copilot 产品的争议巨大且令人担忧。从技术上讲，这个人工智能是使用大家托管在 GitHub 上的代码来进行训练的。

因此，基本上，GitHub 是通过使用你的代码来提供一个新产品（如果你愿意的话，还可以加点料）。而且，关于 Copilot，可别忘了，自由软件基金会（FSF）也 建议 不要在 GitHub 上托管代码。

我们知道，企业总是喜欢利用事物，但有些人认为这应该不会直接损害托管在 GitHub 上的项目/代码。

但是，是这样吗？

简而言之，在 Copilot 发布后，许多开发者都分享说，他们发现 GitHub Copilot 生成了受版权保护的代码：


我试了下 GitHub Copilot，这是一项付费服务​​，来看看它是否会使用带有限制性许可证的存储库的代码。我检查了它，看看它是否有我在之前雇主那里编写的代码，该代码有一个许可证，只允许其用于免费游戏，并且需要附加许可证。是的，它确实有。




当然，如果我们查看 GitHub Copilot 的常见问题解答（FAQ），其中提到：


GitHub 不拥有 GitHub Copilot 生成的建议。您在 GitHub Copilot 的帮助下编写的代码属于您自己，由您自己负责。


所以说，你为一项服务付了费，最终却为你的项目增加了不便和更多的工作？

在我看来，就简化开发者的任务而言，这听起来一点儿也不令人兴奋。

你对此有什么想法？请在下面的评论区中分享一下吧！

2、简介
通知是 Android 在您的应用 UI 之外显示的消息，用于向用户提供提醒、来自其他人的通信或来自您的应用的其他及时信息。用户可以点击通知打开您的应用或直接从通知中执行操作。
2.1、展示
通知以不同的位置和格式向用户显示，例如状态栏中的图标、通知抽屉中更详细的条目、应用程序图标上的徽章以及自动配对的可穿戴设备。
当发出通知时，它首先在状态栏中显示为一个图标。
2.2、操作
用户可以在状态栏上向下滑动以打开通知抽屉，他们可以在其中查看更多详细信息并根据通知执行操作。
用户可以向下拖动抽屉中的通知以显示展开的视图，该视图显示其他内容和操作按钮（如果提供）。
通知在通知抽屉中保持可见，直到被应用程序或用户关闭。
3、功能拆解

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GeckoLinux 创建者推出了一个基于 Debian 的新 Linux 发行版，专注于简单性和可用性。




GeckoLinux 改进了的 openSUSE 体验，它的创建者一直保持匿名。

我不会评论这是好事还是坏事，但现在，开发者又带着另一个基于 Debian 的类似项目回来了。

SpiralLinux，这是一个基于 Debian 的发行版，旨在使 Debian 适合最终用户使用。

SpiralLinux：基于 Debian 构建的发行版



毫不奇怪，大多数用户友好的 Linux 发行版都将 Debian 作为其原始基础。Ubuntu 就是在此基础上进行了大量改进，从而提供了良好的桌面体验，即使对于没有 Linux 经验的用户也是如此。

那么，这个发行版有什么不同呢？

嗯，它的创建者说，这个项目旨在帮助你获得 Debian 的所有核心优势，而无需定制很多东西。

如果你想在桌面上使用 Debian，SpiralLinux 是一种接近原版的体验。你还可以根据需要升级到最新的稳定 Debian 版本（或不稳定/测试版），而不会丢失方便易用的自定义设置。

换句话说，SpiralLinux 使 Debian 适合桌面使用，而最终用户只需付出最小的努力。

为了实现这一点，SpiralLinux 使用了 Debian 官方软件包存储库，并提供了现场安装方式，让你能够定制自己的 Debian 系统。

此外，SpiralLinux 还具有以下功能：


开箱即用的 VirtualBox 支持

预装了专有的媒体编解码器和非自由软件包存储库

预装了专有固件

打印机支持

通过 GUI（软件中心）支持 Flatpak

默认启用 zRAM 交换

多种桌面环境（Cinnamon、XFCE、Gnome、Plasma、MATE、Budgie、LXQt）


Debian 始终坚持使用开源和自由软件包，最终用户必须自己搞定编解码器、驱动程序和其他软件包，才能使许多功能正常工作，获得令他们满意的桌面体验。

而 SpiralLinux 似乎可以作为 Debian 的一个有用的替代品，就像 GeckoLinux 之于 openSUSE 一样。

下载 SpiralLinux

如果你一直想尝试 Debian，但又不想在初始配置上费尽心思，你可以尝试 SpiralLinux。

你可以前往其托管在 GitHub 上的官网以了解更多信息，链接如下：

A sophisticated spyware campaign is getting the help of internet service providers (ISPs) to trick users into downloading malicious apps, according to research published by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) (via TechCrunch). This corroborates earlier findings from security research group Lookout, which has linked the spyware, dubbed Hermit, to Italian spyware vendor RCS Labs.
Lookout says RCS Labs is in the same line of work as NSO Group — the infamous surveillance-for-hire company behind the Pegasus spyware — and peddles commercial spyware to various government agencies. Researchers at Lookout believe Hermit has already been deployed by the government of Kazakhstan and Italian authorities. In line with these findings, Google has...

This genre is a mostly forgotten art because, in my opinion, few movies today are able to capture the truly unhinged paranoia of prior decades.

欧洲航天局于 2003 年发射的火星快车号已经运行了近 20 年，火星快车号包括两个部份：火星快车号卫星与小猎犬 2 号登陆器，不过小猎犬 2 号后来失去联系。卫星上的火星地下和电离层探测高级雷达（MARSIS）是 2018 年在火星上发现巨大的地下液态水层的关键，该软件使用的是基于 Windows 98 的开发环境。欧洲航天局正在升级该软件，新的软件将使 MARSIS 开启的时间延长五倍，并在每次通过时探索更大的区域。这就像是“发射近 20 年后，火星快车号上有了一个全新的仪器一样。”


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：看来 Windows 98 一直运行的也挺好。那么，微软为啥让大家一直升级呢？




ARM 最初的操作系统 35 年后仍在更新

1987 年 6 月，Acron 推出了起价 800 英镑的 Archimedes A305 / A310 计算机。在那个年代，其产品性能设计相当先进，且提供了当时名为 Arthur 的新操作系统。两年后，它被更名为 RISC OS。如今，RISC OS 的一个分支，仍然支持 Acron 时代独特的 26 位模式，当然，目前只能运行在模拟器中。另一个分支是为 32 位的 ARM 芯片设计的，并于 2018 年开源。如今，它还在继续维护更新，近日发布了一个源自 OpenBSD 的新 TCP/IP 栈，带来了对 IPv6 的支持。但它目前还不支持 Wi-Fi，以及不支持多核处理器技术 SMP。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这么古老的操作系统，是操作系统发展历史上一块块纪念碑，更多只是回味。




“首个桌面操作系统根社区” openKylin 发布

昨日，麒麟软件联合普华、中科方德、麒麟信安、中兴新支点、先进操作系统创新中心等发起了中国“首个桌面操作系统根社区” openKylin 社区。所谓根社区，是指基于 Linux 内核和其他开源组件而构建，不依赖上游发行版的社区。在视频发布会上，邀请了若干院士发表了致辞，并呼吁更多的行业伙伴加入，携手打造“产业主导、平台自主、技术先进、生态丰富”的桌面操作系统根社区。

It's Free RPG Day again, and there's no better to play a free roleplaying game than with free and open source software. In this digital era of pen-and-paper gaming, it's still relatively unusual for adventures to include digital maps. In fact, it's also unusual for paper adventures to include maps that are sized correctly for miniatures, and many that do have colourful and richly textured maps that look great in a glossy book but look murky when photocopied and enlarged for the tabletop. Long story short: a tabletop gamer is often in need of a quick and convenient way to produce maps. Mipui is an open source web app that enables you to crea…]]></summary>

如今，人们有更多喜欢 Linux 的理由。在这个系列里，我将分享 21 个使用 Linux 的理由。今天，我将从游戏开始。

我过去认为“游戏玩家”是一种非常特殊的生物，要由科学家们在数年的研究和测试之后严谨地认定才行。我从来没有把自己归类为游戏玩家，因为我所玩过的游戏要么是桌面游戏（棋盘类游戏和纸笔角色扮演游戏），要么是 NetHack、俄罗斯方块。现在，在移动设备、游戏机、电脑和电视机上都有游戏，我觉得现在的承认有各种形式的游戏玩家们了。如果你想自称为游戏玩家，你就可以是，不需任何资格认定。你不用必须在心里熟记那些“上上下下左右左右BA”的科乐美秘籍（你甚至可以不知道这是什么）；你也不用必须买过和玩过 3A 级游戏。如果你时不时地玩游戏，你就完全可以自称为玩家。如果你想成为一名玩家，那么现在使用 Linux 正当其时。

欢迎来到游戏世界

剥除光鲜的广告，在其下面，你肯定会发现一个欣欣向荣的游戏世界。在人们相信不是电子表格也不是练习打字一类的软件能挣钱以前，新兴的游戏市场已经开始发展起来了。独立游戏indie game已经在流行文化上以各种方式打上了自己的烙印（或许你不相信，《我的世界》尽管不是开源的，但一开始就是一款独立游戏），这也证实了，在玩家眼里，可玩性高于产品价值。

独立开发者和开源开发者之间有很多交集。没有什么比带着你的 Linux 笔记本电脑，浏览 itch.io 或你的发行版的软件库，寻找鲜为人知但珍贵的开源游戏宝藏更有意义了。

有各种各样的开源游戏，包括大量的第一视角射击游戏、Nodulus 之类的益智游戏、运输大亨之类的策略经营游戏、Jethook 之类的竞速游戏、Sauerbraten 之类的竞速逃生游戏，以及很多未提到的（多亏了像 O…]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。  
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

为了本文的叙事方便，在本文的开头，我先界定一下本文所探讨的范围。通常来讲，Outlook 有三种所指：其一是电脑或手机上的 Outlook 客户端，其二是 Outlook 域名后缀的邮箱，其三是微软所推出的免费的个人电子邮件服务。本文涉及的就是第三种情况当中的 web 服务，后续文中如果提到 Outlook 而没有明确所指的时候，均表示是此种情况。不过，桌面版的 Outlook 客户端与 web 版的 Outlook 也有相通之处，比如 web 版当中的加载项就可以在桌面版客户端当中使用。
Microsoft Outlook 是一个目前很多人在用的电邮服务。早在2012 年 7 月，微软就正式推出了全新的 Outlook.com 服务。Outlook.com 发展比较迅速，仅至 2014 年 5 月，其用户数量就达到了 4 亿人。
作为 macOS/iOS 上的开发小能手，微软通过持续「赋能」Outlook，吸引了不少跨平台用户的芳心。比如 iPhone 用户可以借助于 Outlook 的支持 exchange 协议的特性，来同步存储手机的通讯录、日程、备忘录。此外因为一些现实的问题，Outlook 也取代了 Gmail 成为常规之下很多人的首选电子邮件服务商。
除开上面提到的 Outlook 支持 Exchange 协议的特性之外，Outlook 集成了Microsoft 全家桶的一些功能，而且不仅于此，它还可以通过插件「加载项」能够更进一步地拓展我们的视野。

前言
继续我们绘图相关篇章，这次我们来看看如何使用 CustomPaint 实现毛玻璃背景图效果。毛玻璃背景图其实就是将图片进行一定程度的模糊，背景图经过模糊后更加虚幻，使得前景和后景就会有层次感。相比直接加蒙层的效果来说，毛玻璃看起来更加好看一些。下面是背景图处理前后的对比，我们的前景图片的透明度并没有改变，但是背景图模糊虚化后，感觉前景更加显眼了一样。

本篇涉及如下内容：
使用 canvas 绘制图片。
绘制图片时如何更改图片的填充范围。
使用 ImageFilter 模糊图片，实现毛玻璃效果。
使用 canvas 绘制图片
Flutter 为 canvas 提供了drawImage 方法用于绘制图片，方法定义如下：
void drawImage(Image image, Offset offset, Paint paint)

其中各个参数说明如下：
image：dart:ui 中的 Image 对象，注意不是Widget 中的 Image，因此绘制的时候需要将图片资源转换为 ui.Image 对象。下面是转换的示例代码，fillImage 即最终得到的 ui.Image 对象。注意转换需要一定的时间，因此需要使用异步 async / await 操作。
Future init() async {
  final ByteData data = await rootBundle.load('images/island-coder.png');
  fillImage = await loadImage(Uint8List.view(data.buffer));
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022 年 6 月 16 日，微软更新了其应用商店的策略。其中一项禁止了发布者对开源或免费的软件收取费用，另一项则针对的是商店使用的不合理高价。如果你在过去几年中访问过微软应用商店，你可能已经注意到，它正在成为越来越多的开源和免费产品的所在地。如果原始开发者将应用程序和游戏上传到商店，这将是有益的，但情况并非如此，因为它们是由第三方上传的。

更糟糕的是，其中许多程序仅作为付费应用提供，而不是免费下载。换句话说，微软的客户必须付费才能购买应用商店的版本，而它们在其他地方是免费的！在应用商店中，免费版和付费版有时并存。为免费应用付费已经够糟糕的了，但这并不是用户在购买时可能遇到的唯一问题。更新也可能是一个问题，因为山寨应用可能不会像源头应用程序那样频繁或快速地更新。

在更新的微软商店政策中，微软在 10.8.7 节下指出：


在您决定产品或应用内购买的定价时，您的数字产品或服务的所有定价（包括销售或折扣）必须：

遵守所有适用的法律、法规和监管要求，包括联邦贸易委员会的《反欺骗性定价指南》。您不得试图从开源软件或其他可免费获得的软件中获利，您的产品也不应提供一个（与它提供的特性和功能相比）过高的不合理定价。


这个新策略在更新部分中得到了确认。如果开源和免费产品普遍免费提供，则它们不得在微软应用商店上出售，发布者也不得对其产品收取不合理的高价。开源和免费应用的开发者可以在微软应用商店上为其产品收费。例如，Paint.net 的开发者就是这样做的。如果微软强制执行这些策略，许多应用将从应用商店中删除。以前，开发者可以向微软报告应用程序，但在新策略下，微软可以直接控制应用的列出和提交。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manjaro Linux 21.3.0 发行包包含一些最新和最强大的更新，包括改进的安装程序。




Manjaro Linux 是一个滚动发布的发行版。因此，从技术上讲，如果你定期更新系统的话，你一直都会使用最新版本。

升级到 Manjaro 21.3.0 应该没什么大不了的，考虑到我已经在正式发布前几天就已经在稳定运行它了，毫无问题。

另外，你可能想阅读一下我 从 Ubuntu 切换到 Manjaro 的初步体验（如果你对于升级仍然犹豫不决的话）。

那么，Manjaro 21.3.0 带来了什么更新呢？

Manjaro 21.3.0 更新内容



桌面环境升级到了最新的稳定版本，而内核版本仍然是 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。

此外，这个版本还包括最终的 Clamares v3.2 版本。让我们来看看它有哪些变化吧。

Calamares v3.2.59

Calamares v3.2.59 安装程序是 3.2 系列的最终版本，它有许多有意义的改进。这次，分区模块包含了对 LUKS 分区的支持和更多改进，以避免那些可能会弄乱 Manjaro 安装的设置。

Calamares 3.2 的所有未来版本都将仅是错误修复。

GNOME 42 + Libadwaita

最初的版本包含了 GNOME 42，而最新的版本包含了 GNOME 42.2（附带最新的更新）。

总体而言，你将获得 GNOME 42 引入的所有优点，包括系统范围的深色模式、基于 GTK 4 的 GNOME 应用的现代用户界面、升级的应用程序以及其他一些重大变化。



KDE Plasma 5.24

不幸的是，考虑到它差不多是在同一周发布的，因此该版本无法包含 KDE Plasma 5.25。

KDE Plasma 5.24 是一个不错的升级，具有更新的主题和概览效果。

XFCE 4.16

在 Xfce 4.16 中，窗口管理器得到了许多更新和改进，以支持小数倍数的缩放和更多功能。

下载 Manjaro 21.3.0

到目前为止，我在 Manjaro 21.3.0 GNOME 版本中没有遇到任何问题。一切看起来都不错，升级也很顺利。

但是，如果你不想重新安装或丢失重要文件，则应始终进行备份。

你可以从 Manjaro 的下载页面 下载最新版本。你也应该可以通过 pamac 包管理器获得更新。

Whether centering on a white-eyed Zosterop or confrontational Spereo Starling, his portraits are minimal with monochromatic backdrops that accentuate the distinct colors and patterns of each plume.
The ongoing series, titled An Incomplete Dictionary of Show Birds, originated with Stephenson wanting to photograph budgies but was intrigued by other species when he met some of his future subjects and their owners. More]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个问题是我最近做业务开发和业余开发都遇到的，这里的 angle 指的是旋转弧度。不是旋转角度。
先看一下我使用 angle 的场景吧：



图一中使用了 canvas.drawArc，传入了 startAngle 和 sweepAngle。图二也是如此。图三是 Flutter ConstraintLayout 中圆形定位的 example，我没有使用 Flutter ConstraintLayout 自带的旋转能力，而是用了 Transform.rotate，传入了 angle。Flutter ConstraintLayout 自带的对 Widget 的旋转能力用了 canvas.rotate，也传入了 angle。
我现在还没搞明白弧度和角度的对应关系，官网文档中也没有详细说明。但对于我来说，我根本就不想去关心弧度是多少，我只关心角度，这个角度的范围是 [0.0, 360.0]。以图三中的时钟为例，旋转 0.0 或 360.0 度时，指针应该指向 12，旋转 90.0 度时，指针应该指向 3，旋转 180.0 度时，指针应该指向 6，旋转 270.0 度时，指针应该指向 9。
于是我们需要将旋转弧度转换成旋转角度，我研究出的转换公式如下：
Transform.rotate：
pi + pi * (angle / 180)

canvas.rotate：
angle * pi / 180

canvas.drawArc：
startAngle = -pi / 2
sweepAngle = angle * pi / 180

看见没有，这三类旋转的转换公式都不一样。我不明白 Flutter 官方为什么要这么设计，为啥这么优秀的 Flutter 引入了这么糟糕的  API。于是我带着气愤给官方提了个 Issue，想喷一喷设计这几个 API 的哥们：

结果我被反杀了。
冷静下来之后，我决定提交一个 Pull Request 来修正这个 API。但这需要时间，因为提交 Pull Request 的周期很长，上次我提了个 bug，Oppo 的一个哥们修复了它，Pull Request 等了将近两个月才合并。
好了，今天就讲这么多吧，你以后很可能会遇到需要旋转的场景，赶紧收藏起来吧！我是中国第一位 Android & Flutter 双料 GDFE，欢迎关注我的公众号 FlutterFirst，带你起飞！]]></summary>

Sketchnoting, also called visual notetaking, is a method of taking notes using illustrations, symbols, graphic layouts, and text. It's meant to be a creative and engaging way to record your thoughts. It can work well in your personal life as well as in your work life. You don't need to be an artist to create a sketchnote, but you do need to listen, and visually combine and summarize ideas through text and drawings.
Why sketchnotes?
Here are some interesting facts about why visual aids are so helpful:

This article is intended to serve as a reference so that you can understand everything you need to be proud of your repository and make your open source project more open. By using open standards, an open source project improves its quality and shareability, since such standards exist to foster better communication between creators and consumers of the project. Most importantly, open standards can guide technology development by gently enforcing space for diversity and equity.
What is open source?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
使用mmap实现的跨进程通信组件，也可用于写入数据较多的场景。
说到跨进程通信，你可能对Binder有着莫名的崇拜之情，因为它几乎贯穿了整个Android系统的跨进程通信任务，如果你探究到Binder是通过mmap实现的时候，你是否跟我一样，想用mmap实现一个跨进程组件，这就是我创建该项目的目的，对于你来说，这是一个不错的学习mmap的开源项目。
对比Binder
优势：
通信数据大小突破binder限制
轻量级，易用
缺点：
安全，目前未考虑安全性，后续可以加进来，比如对数据加密，对外部进程访问加入验证规则
mmap原理
mmap 的函数
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);

addr：指定映射的虚拟内存地址
length：映射的长度
prot：映射内存的保护模式
flags：指定映射的类型
fd:进行映射的文件句柄
offset:文件偏移量
mmap使用了虚拟内存，可以把内核空间和用户空间的虚拟地址映射到同一个物理地址

图中展示的是mmap将读缓冲区的地址和用户缓冲区的地址进行映射，内核缓冲区和应用缓冲区共享，并且用户进程内存是虚拟的，只是映射到内核的读缓冲区，节省一半的内存空间
再来看一张图

读写文件都需要经过页缓存，所以 mmap 映射的正是文件的 页缓存，而非磁盘中的文件本身。由于 mmap 映射的是文件的 页缓存，所以就涉及到同步的问题，即 页缓存 会在什么时候把数据同步到磁盘
Linux 内核并不会主动把 mmap 映射的 页缓存 同步到磁盘，而是需要用户主动触发。同步 mmap 映射的内存到磁盘有 4 个时机：
调用 msync 函数主动进行数据同步（主动）
调用 munmap 函数对文件进行解除映射关系时（主动）

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。  
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

在「玩转 Obsidian」系列的第一篇《玩转 Obsidian 01：打造知识循环利器》中就介绍过 Obsidian 是一款践行 Zettelkasten 1的笔记工具。在使用过程中通过「笔记优先法则2」将知识「碎片化」和「原子化」，并遵循「知识循环3」将知识「组合」后进行输出。
在践行 Zettelkasten 的过程初期，由于我们的笔记数量较少，线索也比较单一，所谓知识管理也没遇到太大问题。例如有的人在用笔记学建筑，有人在学编程，也有人在学法律。总之在使用笔记时是有「一条主线」贯穿始终，帮助我们整理和输出知识。但是当「笔记卡片」积累到一定程度，我们的知识「线索」变得比较杂之后，就会遇到一些问题：

各种笔记种「线索太多」容易遗忘正在做的事情，例如未完成的摘要、写一半的博客、定期整理的「闪念胶囊」等。
各种相关 Todo 散落在笔记中，记不清也找不全，导致许多任务无法完成或推进。

这两个问题就属于「整理线索」的范畴，当笔记达到一定数量时一定会遇到此问题。
一名读者在使用过程中也提出了类似问题：

在他的概述中，他希望能够在一个类似「目录」的页面中，对「知识」做一个「有机的整合」，方便查阅和管理。
要解决「整理线索」问题，最简单的办法就是手动维护一个「目录页面」我称之为「HomePage」，在其中将所有的笔记进行组合，并且定时更新，这样我们就能很清晰的看到各类事情的进展，例如我的 HomePage 如下：

图中可以看到，这个 HomePage 页面包含以下线索：

写在前面——关于传统NAS与轻NAS之争
本文是一篇NAS老用户用户在入手极空间新Z4后的全面体验报告。
实际上，在今年618期间入手极空间新Z4之后，犹豫了好几天要不要写作本文。
原因么很简单，首先是懒。。。。毕竟本着为读者负责的原则，写一篇相对全面一点的使用体验，怎么也要奔着1万字往上了。。。

 
其次，目前站内关于极空间NAS的文章，评论区大概率会有老哥要来大战一番，平白无故被喷，我也怕。。。
但是实际上手体验了新Z4后，个人感觉极空间的整体表现并没有评论区老兄们说的那么差，我自己是感觉还是不错的。
缺陷么，是有的，但是优点么，也是很突出，没必要夸到天上，也没必要踩到地里。左思右想，还是觉得有义务给大家来个客观的、较为全面的使用体验。
在系统的成熟度、稳定性、可玩性上，群晖、威联通等传统大厂毫无疑问是要碾压以极空间为代表的的新晋NAS厂商的，毕竟研发底蕴积累的太雄厚了；但是从另一个角度来看，船小好调头，在易用性、学习成本等方面，极空间毫无疑问的又要比群晖、威联通强的多，这方面用过的老哥应该都有数。
作为一个17年入手白群晖，后续陆续使用过威联通、爱速特等传统NAS的老油条，个人认为，其实这是不同NAS品牌设计思路和方向不同导致的结果。
传统NAS厂商需要兼顾专业用户和企业级用户的实际功能需求，所以依然保留了较为完整全面的功能设置选项，可设置的选项多，必然带来操作上的便利性受到一些影响，这方面威联通最好的例子。
而以极空间为代表的的新晋轻NAS品牌的设计思路，则是全面倒向新手家庭用户，在尽量保证安全稳定的基础上，以便于用户使用、提高易用性作为第一要务。
事实上，从群晖DSM7.0、威联通…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[罗哥就这样退网了，本来想写点什么，写到一半又放下，看完了晚点 LatePost 的采访全文，又无意中刷到了那场八年前的直播辩论，还是忍不住写下这篇。
在罗哥做手机之前，我是完全不认识他的，毕竟我触网时间比较晚，似乎错过了很多热闹的早期网事。直到有一天，罗哥开始在微博上吐槽各家手机操作系统，包括已经被抛弃的 webOS，作为这个系统的社区站长，我责任感爆棚，用煮机网的官方账号，开始跟罗哥在微博上争论，不打不相识，由此产生了随后的各种故事。 
那时候煮机网的粉丝才四五万，罗哥的粉丝应该是八百万，结结实实的被网虐了一番。于是我自己下了一个赌注，如果罗哥的手机做出来，有六成专业用户都认可，我就全站挂横幅，并登门道歉。但罗哥应该根本不记得这个事，在众多的微博对战中，我应该是最小，最没有背景的那一个。
后来，Smartisan OS 发布了，很酷很漂亮，再后来，锤子 T1 上市了，我第一时间买了一台，用了一段时间之后，我觉得我应该道歉，它虽然有很多不完善，但已经是一个很强的手机了，尤其是罗哥这个外行人做出来的。
就这样，通过微博私聊预约，我在摩托罗拉大厦的锤子科技的会议室见到了罗哥，那天的我超级紧张，因为我是没想到能见到他的，毕竟既是超级网红又是企业老板。
迟了几分钟，罗哥出现了，对我说的第一句不算客气：麦老板，你有何指教？
其实可以理解，罗哥脾气直率，很多媒体人见了罗哥，表面说一套，回去又写成另一套，这种事情多了之后，对媒体人的态度自然好不了。但当我表示是专程来道歉，同时希望获得一些创业指导时，罗哥的话匣子就敞开了。
首先，罗哥不看好媒体创业，尤其是评测媒体，没有良性的商业路径，除非你足够流氓。他还用自己牛博网的经历来告诉我，做内容有多难。罗哥建议我多看看数码产品和配件，深圳有最好的供应链，做点好产品更有价值。
这次聊天之后，我决定逐渐停掉以「评测和评论」为主的煮机网，集中精力投入到专注软件和教程的少数派，先服务好用户，再拓展 B 端业务。所以我们后来选择了内容付费，数码和配件联名定制，也成了我们今天的收入主力。
两年之后，我们推出了官方的付费栏目 Power+，拿到外部平台宣传时，需要有名人推荐，我在微信里找了一圈，发现自己实在不认识名人，就冒昧的请求罗哥写一段推荐语。许久之后得到了罗哥的回复，他竟然答应了，并表示他也是少数派的读者，这顿时让我信心倍增。
又过了一年，罗哥来深圳了，约我喝杯咖啡，那时正是坚果销量过百万的时候，感觉锤子科技终于熬过了最难的阶段，要开始快速发展了。
罗哥憧憬着未来，顺便问了我的情况：你现在做的怎么样？我说就是做一些软件和系统教程，帮助用户更好的玩转手机。罗哥突然想到，我们手机系统里有很多功能彩蛋，产品经理没空写，营销部门写不好，不如交给你来做吧。
就这样，我们开始给 Smartisan OS 挖掘使用方法和场景内容，就有了一篇“如何用坚果手机帮我做香港代购”的精彩文章，让大家看到手机系统的生产力价值。当然，也会有一帮人怀疑我们内容造假，但不管怎样，这个专题成了少数派内容服务的经典案例。
然而事情并没有往想象中发展，鸟巢的发布会我也去了现场，我希望能有重大转折，但感觉 TNT 的摊子铺的太大了，坐在角落为罗哥捏把汗。随后的日子里，不好的消息一个接着一个，可以想象罗哥的焦头烂额，我也再没有去打扰他。
尽管不希望罗哥失败，Smartisan OS 终究还是被收购了，罗哥为了给锤子科技还债，转身进入了直播带货界。这时，我们的数码配件也终于做出来了，并且进了罗哥的直播间。据了解，正值 iPhone 12 发布，官方充电器减配，当晚的竞标是比较激烈的，但是罗哥还是选择了我们这个新晋小品牌，介绍产品的时候，罗哥也多点评了一句：在我们做手机的那么多年里，少数派是罕见能保持公正评价的科技媒体。我看了之后感慨万千，好在我们的产品设计还算争气，作为最早的彩色充电器，冲进了热销榜第三名。
如今，罗哥彻底离开了社交网络，很难再看到他的观点和态度，而他在 AR 领域的新产品，可能也要几年之后才能跟大家见面，我突然感觉一个时代结束了，有种莫名的失落感。作为草根出身的东北人，罗哥有没有改变手机和直播行业，我无权评价；但作为理想主义创业者，罗哥实实在在的影响了我和我的事业。

2014 年 8 月 25 日的第一次见面，转眼就过去八年了，我们经历了很多困难，却都没有放弃创业。如今，罗哥五十，我也四十了，依然期待那一天，我们还能江湖再见！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[随着短视频的流行，大家对于信息获取的渠道越来越依赖视频和图片，有些内容是适合视频和图片化，而有些则不是，但是因为注意力焦点转移的问题。人们在短视频中花了太多的时间，实际上获取和沉淀下来，可供二次创作的信息越来越少，换言之——信息水化严重。那么如何从这些视频、图片中提取干货呢？
处理图片里的文字，首先想到 OCR 对吗？利用图像识别可以获取图片中的文字，大家并不陌生，也有很多浏览器插件可以实现 OCR。一般情况下，对图片 OCR 需要下载特殊的程序、或者依赖外部网络来远端识别。缺陷就是操作繁琐，如果是网络 OCR 速度则受网络影响很大，速度、精度都不佳。随着近年来，苹果在硬件和软件方面的突飞猛进，在 macOS 上有了更快速、可靠、免费的工具——点击图片复制文字。 比方说
iPhone 相册自带的从图片中获取文字
你可以通过选中对应位置来对单独的文字做处理，复制、翻译。
而支持相册里复制文字功能背后的技术，第三方 app 也可以使用，所以 LightNote 就是利用苹果设备内置的算力来提供这项功能——高效和准确。
适用场景
视频大部分时候是为了提供即时的享受，但有些视频里藏着重要的信息，你不想错过。举个例子，《报告老板》的片头都要大段的文字来表述本集的内容，为其定性、定调，不乏一些有趣的段子。如果你想了解完整的内容，可以在合适的时候暂停、人肉誊写或者截屏后，寻找单独的 app 或者网络服务做 OCR 来实现——冗长繁琐。 LightNote 提供了一键截屏 + OCR 功能，并且可将此截图和结果用笔记的形式保存起来，供日后检索、再创作。

依赖视频学习课程、新技能的人群。他们在视频中接收更生动活泼的知识关注，在快乐学习的时候，还是会需要把视频中的信息，保存为文字消化、吸收成为自己的知识。比如你想把下面这个历史题目作为背诵内容的素材。

Habits have an unfair reputation of being bad things that need to be stopped. But consider this: Automation and habits have many things in common. First, they're both repetitive. They're done over and over, the exact same way. More importantly, they reduce costs (both cost per piece and cost of energy used).
Art Markman's book Smart Thinking stresses the importance of creating habits to take your mind away from unimportant thoughts and redirect your attention toward more interesting and creative ideas. You can apply this concept to the use of open organization principles.
This article is the second part of a two-part series on habits. The first part dr…]]></summary>

Distributed systems have unique requirements for the site reliability engineer (SRE). One of the best ways to maintain site reliability is to enforce a certain set of best practices. These act as guidelines for configuring infrastructure and policies.
What is a circuit breaker pattern?
A circuit breaker pattern saves your service from halting or crashing when another service is not responding.

如果你方便看视频，直接去 哔哩哔哩 或者 YouTube 看视频就好。
下面是视频内容的脚本整理稿。如果你看了视频，那下面的文稿就不用看了。

这是我在网上找到的一份 Android 键值对存储方案的性能测试对比（数越小越好）：

可以看出，DataStore 的性能比 MMKV 差了一大截。MMKV 是腾讯在 2018 年推出的，而 DataStore 是 Android 官方在 2020 年推出的，并且它的正式版在 2021 年 8 月才发布。一个官方发布的、更（gèng）新的库，性能竟然比不过比它早两年发布的、第三方的库。而且我们能看到，更离谱的是，它甚至还比不过 SharedPreferences 。Android 官方当初之所以推出 DataStore，就是要替代掉 SharedPreferences，并且主要原因之一就是 SharedPreferences 有性能问题，可是测试结果却是它的性能不如 SharedPreferences。
所以，这到底是为什么？
啊，我知道了——因为 Google 是傻逼！
SharedPreferences：不知不觉被嫌弃
大家好，我是扔物线朱凯。
键值对的存储在移动开发里非常常见。比如深色模式的开关、软件语言、字体大小，这些用户偏好设置，很适合用键值对来存。而键值对的存储方案，最传统也最广为人知的就是 Android 自带的 SharedPreferences。它里面的 -Preferences，就是偏好设置的意思，从名字也能看出它最初的定位。
SharedPreferences 使用起来很简单，也没什么问题，大家就这么用了很多年。——但！渐渐地，有人发现它有一个问题：卡顿，甚至有时候会出现 ANR。
MMKV：好快！
怎么办？换！2018 年 9 月，腾讯开源了一个叫做 MMKV 的项…]]></summary>

Flutter中的Key，一直都是作为一个可选参数在很多Widget中出现，那么它到底有什么用，它到底怎么用，本篇文章将带你从头到尾，好好理解下，Flutter中的Key。
我们首先来看下面这个Demo：
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    Container(
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
    Container(
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
  ],
)


展示为两个不同颜色的方块。
问题1
这时候，如果我们在代码中交换两个Container的位置，Hot reload之后，它们的位置会发生改变吗？
下面我们把Demo修改一下，将Container抽取出来，并在中间放一个Text用来做计时器，并改为StatefulWidget，代码如下。
class KeyBox extends StatefulWidget {
  final Color color;

  KeyBox(this.color);

  @override
  _KeyBoxState createState() => _KeyBoxState();
}

class _KeyBoxState extends State {
  var counter = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(

manim 是视频博主 3Blue1Brown 开发的动画引擎，他使用 manim 创作出了许多直观、美丽的数学科普内容。

可以先看一下我用 manim 制作的一个小动画，之后我会放出代码。

前言
我很早就了解到了 manim，但在很久以后我才尝试去使用它，令我惊讶的是它并没有想象中的麻烦，让我不禁联想到 Apple 的 SwiftUI，使用简单的几句代码，通过「描述」这里存在着什么样的东西，就能制作出想要的效果。
安装
在 mac 终端里分别输入
brew install py3cairo ffmpeg
 
brew install cmake pango scipy
 
pip3 install manim
运行第一个项目
manim 是运行在 python 下的，首先创建一个 python 文件 test.py，它基本结构是长这样的。
from manim import * # 导入 manim

class Test(Scene): # 定义一个场景
    def construct(self):
        #code here
新建一个文件夹 manim 用来存放 manim 项目，将文件放入。
为了运行这个项目，你需要先了解一点命令行的知识。
打开 mac 的终端，目前你处于根目录下，输出 ls 可以显示当下目录下的所有文件和文件夹。
输入 cd <文件夹名> 可以进入到这个文件夹。
例如，我的文件夹 manim 是创建在文件夹 Downloads 下的，要进入 manim 文件夹，我需要输入
cd Downloads

cd manim
或者
cd Downloads/manim
进入到 test.py 所在的文件后，可以通过这样一行命令运行项目。
manim test.py Test
这里 Test 是我在上面的示例中定义的场…]]></summary>

Perpetually evoking nature and mythology to address historical issues of contemporary relevance, Mutu positions women as the most powerful, revering their physical form and highlighting their innate connection to ecology. More]]></summary>

The Rust programming language is becoming increasingly popular these days, used and loved by hobbyists and corporations alike. One of the reasons for its popularity is the amazing tooling that Rust provides making it a joy to use for developers. Rustup is the official tool used to manage Rust tooling. Not only can it be used to install Rust and keep it updated, it also allows you to seamlessly switch between the stable, beta, and nightly Rust compilers and tooling. This article will introduce you to rustup and some common commands to use.

In my previous article, I wrote about incident management (IM), an important component of site reliability engineering. In this article, I focus on change management (CM). Why is there a need to manage change? Why not simply just have a free-for-all where anyone can make a change at any time?
There are three tenets of effective CM. This gives you a forecast framework for your CM strategy:

跟车的经验，是一种「经验之谈」。副驾于我，更像是一个岗位，一个全面认识开车、坐车以及道路的最佳看台。这个位置，某种程度上渗透了我过去的一段旅行生活与作为领队身份的工作。
开车时，即便把自己当做机器来应对路上的种种，也多有无力，此时若有一个好的副驾，自然锦上添花。
一点经验，仅供抛砖引玉。
「起源」
《头文字 D》这部作品中的副驾，自然是碓冰山上惹人注目的「Impact Blue」双人组中的沙雪。
两位个性十足的女车手，和一辆 Sil80。如果说 Akina SpeedStar 的池谷与拓海的老友阿树也曾经是算作「出场」副驾的话，其更多的意义似乎就在于配重了（笑）。

在作品中，沙雪已经不仅仅以解说身份参透了一切，也直接挑明了这样一个人的存在带有何种的意义——这并不是一件多么令人羞愧的事。当然，碓冰最速传说，同时也算是《头文字 D》系列里唯二的女车手，作为副驾的作用当然是让真子跑得更快，更好地发挥「本地优势」，更好地贯彻驾驶的绝对效率。
赛事与路书
现实中，领航员这个词汇一般出现在拉力赛事中，它的作用在于引导驾驶员完成赛事，在使用路书和导航设备支持驾驶员以正确的方向和速度驾驶，且作为驾驶员的辅助和支持人员存在（包括脱困和修车）。副驾能够称职地完成工作，车手也就能更加专注于比赛，专注于压榨车辆的速度。
尘埃官网的简略描述
在拉力比赛中，路书（Pacenotes/Road Book）是用来准确描述前方的路况、在最微小的细节上提示车手应该如何驾驶的通用方法。路书不仅要描述赛道的概况，还要记录弯角、交叉路口等细节情况，包括赛道上一些…]]></summary>

前言
前段时间我发了几篇文章介绍了一下自己的博客搭建流程及组件，有很多朋友跟着我的教程也搭建了自己的博客。同时，也有一些朋友提出了疑问，在 2022 年这个时间节点，已经有那么多成熟的写作与发布平台，为什么我们还要那么大费周章，搭建与更新自己的博客呢？
我从大一（2015 年）开始写公众号，分享一些关于书、电影与个人生活的文章；2018 年开始使用 Wordpress 搭建了一个自己的个人博客，于 2019 年迁移到了 Hugo + Github Pages 并维护至今 。
在这两年时间里，我共计更新了 70 篇文章，主要包含课程笔记、技术与效率相关主题，自搭建了网站数据统计系统以来有近万名访客。本文想从我个人经历的角度跟大家讲讲我在写博客过程中的所思所想，也许能够为正在犹豫的你提供一些参考。
个人博客
为什么选择个人博客
我们先从上文的问题谈起：
既然现在已经有了那么多成熟的内容分发平台了，为什么我们还要选择搭建个人博客呢？
移动互联网与智能手机普及之后，「blogger」 一词似乎已经成为了时代的眼泪，前段时间我还被加入了一个「致敬仍然在写博客的朋友」的列表，有些哭笑不得。
随着互联网的迅速发展，我们有了更多的表达渠道，却又似乎丧失了表达的欲望。朋友圈、微博等似乎是适合情绪表达的第一阵地，但字数限制与太多的社交关联又让我们望而却步；而知乎、简书这样的平台又似乎太过「专业」，并不适合所有内容，也容易被网络舆论所左右。
个人博客则是一个更完美的选择。我们可以随心所欲地按自己的喜好定制博客的各个模块，而折腾与优化的过程就像装修自己的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在五月来临之前，一川读完了杨潇所著的《重走：在公路、河流和驿道上寻找西南联大》，这大概是我近年来看过的最有现场感，记述手法也很特别的一本书。在阅读的过程中，我就想着一定要把这本书分享给更多人。
这部近 700 页的作品可以讲的内容实在太多，一川尽力将最打动我的部分分享出来，希望能与前路晦暗莫测的当下形成映照，笔力不及之处还望见谅。非常推荐大家去看这本书，不要被它的体量吓到，可读性非常强，你越读会越珍惜，舍不得太快读完。
这部 49 万字的旅行文学，试图在 80 多年后的今天，去回望西南联大传奇的起点。1937 年七七卢沟桥事变爆发，平津沦陷，清华、北大、南开三校南下湖南组成长沙临时大学。随着抗日战况愈演愈烈，长沙接连遭到日军空袭。1938 年的 2 月，长沙临大决定再西迁至云南昆明，同时分三路疏散临大师生，其中，由近 300 名男生和 11 位教授及助教（五位教授包括清华的闻一多、李继侗、袁复礼，北大的曾昭抡，南开的黄钰生）组成的 “湘黔滇旅行团”，历时 68 天，徒步 1600 公里，最终抵达昆明，与走路、铁路的师生会合，组成著名的西南联合大学。

How did they get there?

“旅行作家保罗 · 索鲁曾经抱怨，为什么那么多书，从一开头就把读者放到异国他乡，却不负责带领他前往？How did you get there？没错，你是怎么抵达那儿的？当我面对‘西南联大’这四个字时，问自己的正是这个问题。”
——杨潇《重走：在公路、河流和驿道上寻找西南联大》

说起西南联大，我们能想到一连串响当当的名字——闻一多、陈寅恪、沈从文、冯友兰、汪曾祺、穆旦、邓稼先、杨振宁…… 作为八年抗战时期的临时大学，它汇集了中国在那个时代最为出色的教授与青年，在艰苦的条件下，延续着教育的薪火。
但是传奇是如何开始的？从平津到长沙再到昆明，在时局动荡、交通不便、资讯不畅的战争年…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[嘿 Siri，核酸检测。

背景
作者的所在地是郑州，目前我们实行的是每两天（48小时）一次核酸检测。
所有公共场所或是小区等地均有专属场所码，在进入该场所之前需要使用微信或支付宝扫码，并把扫码结果出示给工作人员，扫码后你的手机上会显示如下信息：

当前场所名称
动态显示当前日期与时间
你的姓名与身份证（部分遮挡）
48 小时内的核酸检测结果
疫苗接种情况
如果是绿码，则整体的背景色为绿色
我是腺体疫苗，只有两针剂
其中多数公共场所必须 48 小时内的核酸检测结果为阴性才能进入，而除了成年人要每两日检测核酸之外，没有手机身份证的儿童也会在幼儿园、学校等要求下，不定期上传核酸检测结果。
所以检测核酸几乎成了郑州人民的日常。
静态核酸检测码
其他地区不太清楚，但是我们这边全市公共核酸检测，使用的都是同一套系统，且每个人的检测二维码自申请之日起就是固定不变的，这也使得检测码可以被离线调取。
如何判断你的检测码是否是静态的，可以使用这个方法：

将不同时间获取的检测二维码分别截图储存；
用微信扫描这些二维码，看里边的文本内容是不是一致的；
如果内容每次一样，就说明为静态二维码。

为了实现全民出行随时能有 48 小时的阴性核酸，全市像这样的检测屋大概有 4000 多个，分布在大街小巷。在需要做核酸检测的时候，在检测屋窗户右下角的位置让扫码设备扫一下你的核酸检测码，就可以识别出你的信息，然后进行下一步的检测。

为什么要用快捷指令
正常情况下我们调取核酸检测码，是在一个叫做「郑好办」的 APP 中，大概需要经过 4 次点击才能找到，如果网络状况差，可能等待的时间会更久。所以大多数人都把检测码截图放在相册中，使用的时候打开相册找出来就可以。
但这种方式始终不够酷。
使用快捷指令，除了可以迅速出示检测码之外，还可以通过 Siri 调取。而且这些动作也都同时可以在你的 Apple watch 上体验：

举起手臂唤起 Siri ；
说出「核酸检测」；
将手表对准扫码设备。

一气呵成。

具体操作步骤
想要实现单个人的二维码调取非常简单，大体思路就是，把图片转为 Base64 编码1的文本，存入快捷指令（因为快捷指令只能离线存储文本，不能存储多媒体信息），然后在快捷指令中解码呈现。具体的操作步骤如下：
1.  准备好你的核酸检测二维码截图；
2. 把截图裁剪为正方形，只保留二维码的部分2；
3. 通过这个网址将二维码图片转为 Base64 编码的文本；
4. 转换后的文本要将开头声明数据类型的这部分删除（重要）：data:image/jpeg;base64, 然后复制剩余文本；
图片分辨率越低，转换后的代码越短，越不容易卡顿
5. 打开快捷指令，新建一个快捷指令「核酸检测」3；
6. 拖出一个「文本」组件，并填入第 4 步中转换好并处理完毕的 Base64 编码文本；
7. 紧接着拖出一个「Base64 编码」组件，并设置为「解码」；
8. 最后加入一个「快速查看」，设置显示「Base64 已编码内容」，同时将类型设置为「图像」。
使用「快速查看」而不使用「显示结果」是为了通过Siri语音操作时也可以正常显示
稍微进阶一下
如果你像我一样，要时常带着儿子或者女儿去做核酸检测，那么你手机中一定存有他们的检测码。这时候我们把上边的快捷指令稍微改动一下，增加一个二级菜单，就可以实现在一个快捷指令中，调取不同人的检测二维码了。具体改动操作如下：
1. 在原快捷指令的最上方加入「从菜单中选取」；
2. 分别命名你要调取的二维码名称（比如：爸爸、儿子、张三等，这个步骤关系到你使用 Siri 操作时的指令语言）；
3. 在每个菜单分类的下方，加入一个「文本」组件，并通过上方 2、3、4 步骤中处理二维码与 Base64 代码的方法，把处理好的代码分别贴进对应的「文本」组件中。

带有二级菜单的快捷指令，在使用 Siri 调取的时候，需要二次对话，讲出二级菜单的名称。但是真实的场景是，如果不是为了装 X ，更多时候我还是会选择在快捷指令下用手点击调取。

最后
虽然本文是利用快捷指令来展示核酸检测码，但是同样的方法也可以用于出示其它信息。比如微信名片、推广二维码、或是一些其它你想展示的任何内容。只要你想展示的信息或者二维码是静态固定不变的，就都可以利用该快捷指令实现。你也可以把你经常会用到的静态二维码，利用上方进阶版的方法，全部做到一个快捷指令中，通过二级菜单进行调取。
每个人对于快捷指令的认识程度各不相同，文章也希望能够让一些零基础的同学自主操作，所以很多地方写的较为详细，目的在于能帮到更多有此类需要的人群。
感谢阅读，希望文章能对你有帮助。]]></summary>

在前一阵用flutter开发web的过程中，遇到了一些坑，遇到了一些与app端开发不一样的地方，当然也学到了一些新知识点，所以总结一下，一方面帮助他人，另一方面，自己也能加深记忆，要不容易忘。
（年纪大了？记忆力还不行了呢🙃🙃🙃）
一、启动运行乱码
没错，启动一个demo,遇到坑了，如图所示

点击Android Studio上方运行按钮，程序启动之后汉字文字显示乱码，这是由于flutter web有三种渲染模式，auto 、html 和 canvaskit，点击运行按钮（flutter build web命令）默认的渲染模式为auto，这种模式在移动端使用html渲染，在pc端使用canvaskit渲染。
解决办法 1： 用命令行运行，并指定渲染模式,就能解决问题。
// 指定渲染模式为html
flutter build web --web-renderer html

解决办法 2： 上面虽然能解决问题，但我习惯用按钮运行程序怎么办？当然也找到了其他办法。在程序包下web/index.html文件中body标签下copy如下代码。
 
  
  
      window.flutterWebRenderer = "html";

  
  

二、Debug启动运行断点失败
web开发和APP端开发一样，也可以断点。项目之初断点是可以的，但是不知道怎么的，debug可以运行，但断不到，很奇怪，花了一上午，发现同事因为发版改了下web/index.html中head->base标签下 href="***"的值。
解决办法 ：
// 之前，断点可用
 
 
// 同事改动,断点不可用
 
 
// 修复后,断点可用


不能断点开发实在是麻烦。
三、Hot Reload热重载、点击浏览器刷新，都会重启整个程序
在APP端开发时，在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在上一篇文章中提到目前我国的法规中没有要求有牵引资质的车辆才能拉拖挂房车，因此理论上任何家用车都可以拉拖挂（五菱宏光MINI这类微型乘用车除外）。
不过我想补充一下，这仅仅只是法规上没有要求而已，我认为这是由于我国拖挂房车市场还没有成熟导致的相关法规缺失，以后大概率会补充相关的法律条款；在这之前我不建议小轿车、低排量SUV用户拉拖挂，除非你确实懂得怎么合理牵引拖挂、明白相关的原理、知道怎么正确安装牵引装置。
因为这两类车动力太小不适合拉拖挂，而且99%没有针对拖挂房车这个场景做优化，也不会原厂带有牵引结构，如果你不懂相关的知识，很容易给你的前车造成损坏，不仅会危及道路、人身安全，也会影响你车子的价值。欧美地区确实有很多POLO、高尔夫、SMART拉拖挂的，那是建立在它们房车市场成熟基础上的。
补充完毕，这一篇文章我们来聊一聊拖挂房车上牌和保险的相关事宜。
拖挂房车要不要上牌？
根据《道路交通安全法实施条例》第56条，“小型载客汽车只允许牵引旅居挂车或者总质量700千克以下的挂车。”有的小伙伴可能会对这条产生误解，以为只能拉700公斤以下的房车，其实这里提到了两个不同的概念：旅居挂车和700公斤以下的挂车，他们同属于挂车。

 
​而旅居挂车就是我们说的拖挂房车，而根据C6驾照的准驾要求，可以驾驶的是轻型牵引挂车且两车相加小于4500KG，轻型的定义是750KG-4500KG。至于700KG以下的挂车则属于微型挂车了。

​
​
那挂车属于机动车吗？根据2020年实施的公安部公共安全行业标准，挂车也属于机动车，因此拖挂房车也是需要上牌的，而且上牌流程和家用车基本一致，需要注意的就是拖挂房车上牌不需要拖挂的交强险，这点在下面细说；然后有的小检测站可能没有检测过拖挂房车所以会不给你检、有的车管所会要求先交购置税再检测等。

​
拖挂房车交保险要注意什么？
​首先要明确的是，根据《道路交通安全法》，拖挂房车是不需要投保交强险的，交强险和牵引的前车共享，如果交强险的额度不够赔偿，再由拖挂的商业险进行承担。

​
所以我们只要购买拖挂房车的商业险就好了。不过由于拖挂还不流行，所以很多小城市的保险公司业务员根本不知道怎么给拖挂房车上保险，他们很可能会给你上特种车辆的保险，这种保险是很贵的，一定要沟通好。一辆十几万的拖挂房车，三者险加车损险一般1500元以内就可以搞定。
在给拖挂房车上牌时也不需要提供拖挂的交强险，但要提交前车的交强险，这里要注意的是，拖挂房车可以由任意车辆牵引，上牌时上交当时牵引车的交强险即可，不一定非得是你自己车辆的交强险。]]></summary>

前言
标题栏是每个 App 都会有的控件，基本每个项目都会对标题栏进行封装。常见的方式是写一个标题栏的布局，用  标签添加到每一个页面中，然后在基类里提供初始化标题栏的方法。或者是实现一个标题栏的自定义控件，使用自定义属性配置标题栏。
这两种常见的标题栏封装有个比较繁琐的地方是每次都要在布局内加标题栏控件，那么有没什么办法在不改动布局代码动态添加标题栏呢？当然有啦，ActionBar 不就是么，声明个主题都加了个标题栏。原理其实很简单，就是一波巧妙的偷天换日操作。
个人很久之前就研究过 ActionBar 源码，实现了不改动布局添加标题栏，感觉挺爽的。不过那只是简单地封装，样式也类似 ActionBar 是固定的，换个项目用可能就不合适了。当我想更进一步解耦时，发现远比想象中的难，因为样式的可能性实在太多了，还可能有些奇怪的需求。如何深度解耦个人思考了非常非常久，终于在熟悉 Kotlin 后摸索了一套比较理想的方案。
下面和大家分享一下个人深度解耦标题栏的思路和方案。
解耦思路
整理一下解耦标题栏需要实现的效果：
能在不改动布局代码的情况下动态添加标题栏；
能扩展所需的标题栏的配置参数，比如有标题跑马灯等小众需求也能支持；
能添加非线性的标题栏，比如可滑动隐藏的标题栏；
支持更新标题栏，可以不用，但不能没有；
解耦标题栏样式，能配置全局样式或单个页面的样式，不需要改动添加和更新标题栏的代码；
不修改布局代码添加标题栏
先来看看 ActionBar 为什么声明主题就能加标题栏的，很容易猜到是在 setContentView(id) 做了处理，那么我们看下 AppCompatActivity 的代码：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
有一段时间没有写钢笔相关的分享了，钢笔在几年内一直是我个人最大的业余爱好。在以往的文章分享和收到的一些咨询中，不少是基础性的使用问题，和对于产品的推荐需求。从我最早2018年开始分享，已经过去了几年，计划重新以入门-进阶-收藏-避坑的系列来和大家谈谈如今对钢笔爱好的个人见解，本篇主要分享钢笔的入门指导。
还写字吗？为什么用钢笔写字？
随着电子产品和通讯产品的发展，社会人对于书写的需求愈发减少了，书写已经是生活的非必要部分，书写工具都是非常成熟的工业化产品，进步空间和进步幅度也非常狭小。
目前世界上最主流的书写工具，必然是中性笔，书写流畅，墨水干速快，书写速度快，使用寿命不错并且主流产品价格低廉。

但以走珠出墨并与纸张接触的中性笔手感偏硬，缺少笔画表现力，在交互体验感上不足。
在我国文化历史上，毛笔是核心的书写工具；在欧洲早期使用羽毛笔，工业化之后制作出了蘸水钢铁笔，这些天然和没有深度工业化加工的材料由于原材料本身书写形变程度更大，在书写表现力上的表现力更强，也传承着古典的书写仪式感。

现代钢笔在18世纪80年代末由法国保险员威迪文先生发明，其产品核心是利用了毛细现象，制备了毛细管根据气压和笔压原理吸墨和供墨，搭配钢铁笔的笔尖进行书写。
英文叫做Fountain Pen，意思书写时墨水可以像泉水一样自行流出，所以我国国标和行业内官方称其为自来水笔，本质就是欧洲早期钢铁笔和毛细系统结合而成的书写工具。

自来水笔名字相对拗口，在汉字中又有歧义，所以如今商品名都叫钢笔，1995年出台的国标虽然老旧，但产品分类一定程度上还可以参考，根据笔尖材质分为钢尖和金尖，金尖钢笔也简称为金笔；钢笔笔尖状态，宏观分为暗尖和明尖。半明尖定位不清晰已经基本被弃用，弯尖在国内又称为美工尖，笔画表现力很强，但完全没办法日常使用，也不适合学生练字，所以基本告别了主流市场。

首先，钢笔本身的墨水…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一个北方人，来南方的心愿之一就是亲眼看看大海，还记得 2001 年刚到深圳的时候，我跟同学本来应该去「福田」找工作，却阴差阳错的坐上了开往「盐田」的公交车，就这样稀里糊涂的坐到了盐田港。下车之后，查查手上的深圳地图（那时还没有手机），发现这里离大梅沙海滩似乎不远了，我俩一商量，不如先去看看大海吧，万一找不到工作回老家了，也少了一个人生遗憾。

于是，我们从盐田港走到了大梅沙，盘山公路一弯接一弯，路很窄，汽车在身边飞驰而过。没想到地图上的一点距离，竟然有十多公里，精疲力尽之后，我俩终于见到了梦想的蓝海银滩，大家可能不知道，那时候的大梅沙海滩是有很多漂亮贝壳的，我们像孩子一样捡拾了很多。
转眼几年之后，同学因为家庭原因，选择回到东北老家发展，而我继续留在深圳打拼，结婚生子之后，也搬到了南山，住到了蛇口老区。那时候，离我们最近的海边就是深圳湾。可惜当年的深圳湾可以说是臭气熏天，蛇口的各种废水直接排入海湾，只有靠近福田的的红树林公园稍微好一点。为了恢复深圳湾环境，深圳修了一个巨大的污水回流工程，截流蛇口半岛的生活污水，反向输送到南山脚下的专业污水处理厂。其中的一段工程就在我住的小区门口，从女儿出生到上小学，足足修了好多年。

又过了几年，深圳湾大桥和深圳湾滨海公园都修好了，虽然有了漂亮的甬路和自行车道，没有了排污管道，但水质还没有真正改善，偶尔还是会飘来一阵阵臭味。那几年的我，正处在创业低谷，焦虑无奈，经常去深圳湾公园疯跑和呐喊，面朝大海，发泄内心郁闷的情绪。

不知不觉又过了几年，深圳湾水质变清了，开始有了螃蟹，甚至偶尔看到小鱼，候鸟也越来越多，连接深圳湾的大沙河也全部治理成生态公园，成了人们休闲露营的好去处。我也经常带着孩子去深圳湾小沙滩堆城堡，去草坪休闲露营。回顾这二十年，深圳对环境的思考和改变，就像一个孩子，从犯错到知错，开始一点点的修正。我们见证了深圳湾的环境变化，它也保存了一群深圳人的成长记忆。

前阵子，拜访了成立十年的「红树林基金会 MCF」，我才进一步了解到，整个海湾生态中，最重要的红树林已经很难恢复了，填海阔地改变了原有的海岸结构，并不是简单种树就能解决的。好在各方努力之下，在深圳河的边缘，还是保留了一片相对完整的林系，里面保护着各种候鸟，还有为数不多的豹猫和欧亚水獭。这也让它成为世界上少有的，摩登都市之下的生态湿地。

二十年弹指一挥间，经过多年打拼，我们依然还是一个小企业，没有赚到多少钱，但也希望能为深圳环境做一点贡献，刚好少数派周边「发财水獭」上市，我们决定每销售一个水獭公仔，就捐赠 20 元给红树林基金会，用于更多的红树林湿地研究和科普保护工作。
期待有一天，我们不在需要红外摄影机，也能在深圳湾看到成群的水獭嬉戏。]]></summary>

介绍
在2017年，那时，观察者模式有效的简化了开发，但是诸如RxJava一类的库有一些太过复杂，学习成本太高，为此，LiveData出现了，一个专用于Android的，具备自主生命周期感知能力的，可观测的数据存储类。同时也出现了ViewModel这个组件，配合LiveData，更方便的实现MVVM模式中Model与View的分离。那么就让本文来带大家来学习LiveData与ViewModel的使用吧。
LiveData和ViewModel的关系：

LiveData是一种可观察的数据存储器类(响应式编程，类似Vue)。与常规的可观察类不同，LiveData 具有生命周期感知能力。LiveData最重要的是它了解观察者的生命周期，如Activity和Fragment。
因此，当LiveData发送变化时，UI会收到通知，然后UI可以使用新数据重新绘制自己。换句话说，LiveData可以很容易地使屏幕上发生的事情与数据保持同步（响应式编程的核心）
使用 LiveData 具有以下优势：
UI与数据状态匹配
LiveData 遵循观察者模式。当底层数据发生变化时，Live…]]></summary>
