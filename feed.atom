Instead of purchasing, owning, and maintaining physical data centres and servers, you can access technology services such as compute, storage, and databases on-demand through a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Key advantages:
Types of Cloud computing:

It’s very good feel that if you are going to learn leading cloud provider AWS. They are the leader in Cloud computing because of:

Gartner Research positions AWS in the Leaders quadrant in the new 2021 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services (CIPS) report. CIPS are defined in the context of this "Magic Quadrant" as "standardised, highly automated offerings in which infrastructure resources (e.g. compute, network and storage resources) are supplemented with integrated platform services".
Global Infrastructure AWS

AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers so many regions and Availability Zones, all characterized by low latency, high throughput and a highly redundant network. AWS is available in 84 Availability Zones within 26 geographic regions worldwide. In addition, 24 additional Availability Zones and 8 additional AWS regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are planned. The AWS Regions and Availability Zones model is recommended by Gartner as a best practice for running enterprise applications that require high availability.

Instance fields can be initialized in 4 ways: 
At the point of protestation 
In a constructor argument using 'this' 
In the constructor’s initializer list before the law in braces starts.
Anywhere Differently 
4 is problematic since the preface of null safety. By the time the constructor body( the law in braces) starts, the object must be completely initialized so each of its fields are usable. So if it isn't initialized in 1, 2, or 3, it fails to collect. 
It literally means “ I'll initialize it latterly ”. And you got no error. 
𝟏- 𝐍𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐞 - 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 
Still, you only know this at runtime when the program fails, If you forget to initialize a late variable. Basically, you say “ Trust me to initialize d ever before it's read for the first time ”. So the compiler skips the initialization check and inserts a runtime check. 
𝟐- 𝐑𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐬 
There's a stir to allow skipping the initialization checks in some shapes. This may beget segfault which is harder to probe than an ordinary exception. 
𝟑- 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 
Your program needs to know if a late variable has been initialized or not. For this, the compiler frequently creates a retired internal variable that takes memory. 
𝟒- 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 ‘ 𝐢𝐟 ’ 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 
Every time you read a late variable the program must insure it's initialized, so a redundant check is added. 
𝟓- 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞.
Every time you write to a late variable the program sets the internal flag to note that it's initialized. 
Hopefully, that helped. Did it? 😃

Linktree, a popular “link in bio” service, is launching a mobile app on iOS and Android, the company announced on Tuesday. Previously, you’ve had to log into Linktree through a browser on desktop or your phone to manage your profile, but if you prefer an app, that will now be an option. The “majority” of Linktree’s signups and logins from its more than 25 million users happen on a mobile device, according to a Linktree press release, so this new app could prove to be a popular choice for creators.
Link in bio services, which generally let you make a simple page with a list of all the links you want to share with the world, have become more and more popular among creators in recent years. Social networks like Instagram and TikTok only let...

In this series, I’d like to go over some tools you might find useful for these cases. I’ll try to limit myself to tools that are 100% debugging tools and not those that are useful for development testing.
E.g. tools like curl or jq are remarkably useful. You can/should use them while debugging. But you probably used them while building and testing the feature. So you would already be familiar with them and should have some sense of what they do. I want to focus on tools that you would mostly reach for when debugging. In that sense, tools like SDKMan etc. also make no sense here.

Optics and imaging giant Nikon will stop making new single lens reflex cameras — once the technological mainstay of professional photography — according to a report from Nikkei. 
The death of SLR cameras has been coming for quite some time, as mirrorless alternatives have increased in image quality while offering consumers the option to use lighter and smaller products. 
According to Nikkei, Nikon will continue to produce and distribute its existing SLR models, but will focus development of new models entirely on mirrorless. Nikkei notes that Nikon’s SLR cameras were “widely used by professional cameramen for more than 60 years and have come to be seen as synonymous with the Japanese company.”

That’s thanks to Bluetooth LE Audio, an umbrella term for a collection of new features for Bluetooth devices that the Bluetooth standards body is officially announcing the completion of today.
Bluetooth LE Audio was announced way back at the beginning of 2020, and the Bluetooth SIG had originally hoped that supporting devices would be released before the end of that year.

早在今年 4 月就发布了的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，是迄今为止最安全的 Ubuntu 版本。

其安全更新的延长支持、新的硬件支持和其他林林总总的改进，使它在安全方面远远超过了之前的所有版本。

但它是如何做到这一点的呢？还有，是什么让这个版本与以前的版本不同的呢？

嗯，有几个原因，Canonical 在一篇新的博客文章中为我们重点指出了这些。在这里，让我总结一下，以帮助你了解更多。

是什么让 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 变得安全？

在这个版本中，Ubuntu 团队似乎投入了大量的工作来确保其长期的安全性和可靠性。尽管多年来他们以难以想象的方式做到了这一点，但我将强调其中的几件事：


改进的硬件安全措施支持

更新了安全包

私有家目录

OpenSSL 3

GCC 11

nftables 作为默认的防火墙后端

Linux 内核改进


1、改进的硬件安全措施支持



随着英特尔、AMD 和 ARM 的 CPU/SoC 开始推出更多的安全措施，拥有足够的软件来让这些功能发挥作用就变得越来越重要。

截至目前，Ubuntu 22.04 支持三种主要的硬件安全措施。

英特尔的 “软件保护扩展Software Guard eXtensions”（SGX）提供了一个安全独立的区域来进行敏感计算。例如，理想情况下，密码处理将在这里进行，因为它确保没有其他应用程序可以访问这些数据。

还有 AMD 的“安全加密虚拟化Secure Encrypted Virtualization”（SEV）。这项技术旨在防止主机操作系统干扰正在运行的虚拟机。

尽管这与桌面用户的相关性不如其他技术，但要知道，很多数据中…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays all clouds have similar offerings. AWS is the more mature one - and therefore a solid choice. However, they are hard to work with in many aspects and have a lot of legacy choices - such as everything being region locked. Google cloud is often seen as the most developer friendly and a great choice if you don't want spend hours banging your head against the wall. Azure also offers great developer experience but it's less reliable in my experience.
Since we work very closely with the 3 major clouds to develop our product - Multy - I have written a blog post on what I have learned about the differences in Virtual Machines in AWS, Azure and GCP.
The blog post goes over:
Regions and availability zones
Virtual machine types and sizes
SSH access and default users
Virtual machine images
Block storage and disk
If you're interested, have a read at https://docs.multy.dev/blog/compute-aws-vs-azure-vs-gcp.
Which cloud provider do you prefer?]]></summary>

The original Dash Cart launched in 2020 and Amazon has been slowly rolling them out (ho ho) to its Fresh grocery stores and Whole Foods Market stores. It’s clear they’re still a bit of an experiment, though, and Amazon says the new Dash Cart will only be available at its Westford, Massachusetts Whole Foods store some time “in the coming months,” before slowly heading to other Fresh and Whole Foods locations across the US.
The cart’s main feature is a sensor array in the rim that uses AI-powered cameras and barcode scanners to identify whatever you put in (or...

在网上搜到这个： https://www.blackdown.org/best-linux-distros-for-virtualbox/，但其一的 Lubuntu 的下载链接居然错的，看来其维护不是太好，似乎也是个人在维护。
那么请教一下，不想折腾，只是普通开发需用一下 Linux 环境，这老台式机的 VirtualBox 跑哪个 Linux 发行版较为流畅？
暂不考虑 WSL ，一是没有图形界面，二是 VirtualBox 与 WSL 冲突，需要在 BIOS 去开或关那个 hyper-v 设置，由于常需 VirtualBox 跑 win7 ，有点麻烦。]]></summary>

I started development in 2014. My first project was on Multi-Level Marketing binary Structure also called MLM Binary 1x2.
That was not easy for me to create the Tree logics that will generate dynamically.

It was hard for me to develop all the logic behind that tree with  lots of condition.
In 2014 there was no content on the Internet on how to build complex logic like MLM Binary 1x2. So I deeply did the experiments for almost 30 days. Then finally, I got a solution. I built that web application and provided it to the client. 
The client was so happy because at that time there were very few developers who can do this. And the client ran the project for almost 2 years and earned a lot of money.
So after learning those complex logic, I was thinking other developers in the world facing the same issue. So I started a YouTube channel and told other developers how I build this.
Here is the link - YouTube Channel
 


  
  
  8 Years in developing Algorithms


So I did not stop here to create complex logic. Then I worked for many Software companies to build complex logic for them. I invested my 8 years to just creating logic. 
I think the journey in complex algorithm development will never end. Every day I learn new things and get more ideas. I still enjoy to develop Algorithms.
Creating Algorithms is an Art]]></summary>

It was used to describe the interaction of an application with the rest of the computer system.
In 1974, API was introduced in a paper called The Relational and Network Approaches: Comparison of the Application Programming Interface. APIs then became part of the ANSI/SPARC framework. It's an abstract design standard for DBMS (Database Management Systems) proposed in 1975. 
By 1990, the API was defined simply as a set of services available to a programmer for performing certain tasks. As Computer Networks became common in the 1970s and 1980s, programmers wanted…]]></summary>

原文地址是 https://go.dev/ref/spec#PrimaryExpr
原文内容是
PrimaryExpr =

MethodExpr |
PrimaryExpr Selector |
PrimaryExpr Index |
PrimaryExpr Slice |
PrimaryExpr TypeAssertion |
PrimaryExpr Arguments .

Selector       = "." identifier .
Index          = "[" Expression "]" .
Slice          = "[" [ Expression ] ":" [ Expression ] "]" |

TypeAssertion  = "." "(" Type ")" .
Arguments      = "(" [ ( ExpressionList | Type [ "," ExpressionList ] ) [ "..." ] [ "," ] ] ")" .

其中我关心的是 Arguments 的定义，它表示为 ( ExpressionList | Type [ "," ExpressionList ] )
ExpressionList 很容易理解，它可以匹配 (1,2,string(1)) 这样的文本，但是 Type [ExpressionList] 怎么理解呢，我从来没见过在 go 里可以写 var v = func_call(TypeName) 这样的表达式
（在上面引用的文本中，[ ] 包裹的内容表示为可选, | 表示匹配其中一个）]]></summary>

If you're reading this article from home, you are probably connected with a LTE/5G/DSL/WIFI router. Such devices are usually responsible to route packets between your local devices (smartphone, PC, TV, and so on) and provide access to the world wide web through a built-in modem. Your router at home has most likely a web-based interface for configuration purposes. Such interfaces are often oversimplified as they are made for casual users.
If you want more configuration options, but don't want to spend for a professional device you should take a look at an alternative firmware such as OpenWrt.

An application written using programming languages like C and C++ requires you to program the destruction of objects in memory when they're no longer needed. The more your application grows, the great the probability that you'll overlook releasing unused objects. This leads to a memory leak and eventually the system memory gets used up, and at some point there's no further memory to allocate. This results in a situation where the application fails with an OutOfMemoryError. But in the case of Java, Garbage Collection (GC) happens automatically during application execution, so it alleviates the task of manual deallocation and possible memory leaks.

HMD has announced a trio of new Nokia feature phones including the Nokia 5710 XpressAudio, which has a built-in charging case for an included pair of true wireless earbuds. The company is far from the first to have had this idea (check out 2019’s Servo R25 as one recent example), but it’s notable to see the form factor attempted by a more established company with global reach.
The Nokia 5710 XpressAudio looks like a regular candy bar-style feature phone from the front, with a 2.4-inch display and classic T9 keypad. But around back, there’s a charging compartment, revealed with the slide of a plastic cover. The device will retail for £74.99 (€69) and will be available in the UK in late July, though there’s no word on a US release.

昨天还在为 WPS 辩护，觉得分享被审核很正常，这个逻辑主要是因为自己经常打开网盘的公开分享链接，后来一想，我把文档分享给我的同事、亲人、朋友，你凭什么偷看？ 我分享只是一个投递的过程，又不是公开的过程
鉴于目前的大环境，也不排除国家正当的要求（譬如下面的英国），金山还是要在用户隐私和监管做平衡，譬如访问很少的链接就不要去扫描，访问很多又可能造成公共事件的再去扫描审核，这样是不是可以取得平衡？
网上的新闻：
根据最新修订的英国数字安全立法，可能要求 WhatsApp 等高度加密的消息服务采用尖端技术来发现儿童性虐待材料，否则会面临巨额罚款。在线安全法案的修正案将要求科技公司“尽最大努力”部署新技术，以识别和删除儿童性虐待和剥削内容 (CSAE)。
根据提议的修正案，Ofcom 监管机构将能够要求科技公司部署或开发新技术，以帮助发现滥用材料并阻止其传播。该修正案收紧了法案中的现有条款，该条款已经赋予 Ofcom 要求部署“认可技术”的权力。如果现有技术不适合他们的平台，现在的变化将要求公司使用他们的“最大努力”来部署或开发“新”技术。]]></summary>

使用 C 编写的应用程序时，通常有多个源码文件，但最终你需要编译成单个的可执行文件。

你可以通过两种方式来完成这项工作：通过创建一个 静态static 库 或 一个 动态dynamic 库（也被称为 共享shared 库）。从创建和链接的方式来看，它们是两种不同类型的库。选择使用哪种方式取决于你的的具体场景。

在 上一篇文章 中，我演示了如何创建一个动态链接的可执行文件，这是一种更通用的方法。在这篇文章中，我将说明如何创建一个静态链接的可执行文件。

使用静态库链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的多个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名称为可执行文件的一个可运行程序。

静态库是通过复制一个程序中的所有依赖库模块到最终的可执行镜像来创建的。链接器将链接静态库作为编译过程的最后一步。可执行文件是通过解析外部引用、将库例程与程序代码结合在一起来创建的。

创建目标文件

这里是一个静态库的示例以及其链接过程。首先，创建带有这些函数识别标志的头文件 mymath.h :

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前几天，少楠评论了我的一个即刻动态。

这个动态里的想法源于我在 flomo 共建群里看到的一个群友的提问：

大家有没有什么整理 memo 的小技巧，感觉随着时间推移，大量零碎的不成体系的 memo 增加了我对 flomo 使用的压力。

在整理思路的时候，我上知乎搜了搜，发现这个问题其实很多人都有遇到：记录了很多笔记，但是因为记得太多，导致笔记杂乱、臃肿，仿佛长年累月吃进了很多无法消化的杂食，这些庞大数量的笔记无法变成自己的东西，然后产生了一些压力甚至焦虑。
可能会有的解决办法
有的朋友会选择在定期对笔记进行删减和清空，按照「极简」的思路，对笔记做减法；但也有人说不用删，因为总有一些句子和当时的闪念会启发到你，成为你日后文章的素材。删与不删，让人纠结。
也有的朋友选择了对现有笔记打标签、做分类。这样可以尽可能多地覆盖已有笔记。这也是一个办法。

但是在一次性批量打标签、做分类的过程中，我们无法细致地品味每一个笔记和还原当时记录时的上下文。
说到上下文的还原，我就联想到了「渐进式总结」，通过高亮、笔记和提炼的多个层级的备注，让笔记既能在高空中一目了然，又能潜入笔记的具体上下文。渐进式总结的核心思路是写给未来的自己，所以我们需要尽可能让未来的我们在提取笔记时更容易1。

一个多月前，我在赋闲在家，时间充裕，在 Obsidian 上记的笔记都比较翔实，也会用 Cubox 践行渐进式总结。但是，当我人来到义乌后，经常出门不带电脑，突如其来的碎片化灵感只能记录在 flomo 里，这让我意识到记笔记的场景不一定是深度的阅读和学习。可能是洗澡时某一个闪念一划而过；也可能在读书时的拍案叫绝的临时摘抄；或者是经历过一次新奇体验的“正念时刻”，想要立马记下来。
如果还要我先打上标签，然后列出关键词，还要做好分类，并且要介绍清楚当时的背景、上下文，可能当我写完这些后，灵感已经因为被遮蔽太久，…]]></summary>

今年，该项目向 18 岁或以上的任何人开放 —— 不仅限于学生和应届毕业生了。参与者通过编写软件获得报酬，其 津贴 的金额取决于他们所在国家/地区的 购买力平价。

LCTT 译注：以往，这个活动只允许在校学生参与，今年条件放开，只需年龄 18+ 即可，对参与者的贡献时长要求也降低了，尽可能地让更多人参与进来。不过，今年的报名通道在 4 月 19 日就截止了，大家有兴趣的话明年可以关注一下。

这也是 Zephyr 项目第一次作为 Linux 基金会的项目，参与到谷歌编程之夏中。让我们一起欢迎这些贡献者及其项目吧！

项目一：基于 Zephyr 的 Arduino 模块

1 个贡献者（350 小时）。

Arduino 是一个流行的框架，它为嵌入式设备编程提供了一个简化的接口。最近，Arduino 采用 mbed OS 作为其一些新设备的基础 RTOS。通过这项工作，他们将 Arduino Core 作为独立的抽象层，从 Arduino Core for mbed 中分离出来。这为在其他操作系统上利用 Arduino Core 开辟了可能性。

该项目的想法就是创建一个利用 Arduino Core 的 Zephyr 模块，以便开发人员在与 Arduino 兼容的设备上使用 Arduino 框架时，可以使用 Zephyr 作为底层操作系统。对用户的好处包括：

Security researchers and The Drive’s Rob Stumpf have recently posted videos of themselves unlocking and remotely starting several Honda vehicles using handheld radios, despite the company’s insistence that the cars have security protections meant to stop attackers from doing that very thing. According to the researchers, this hack is made possible because of a vulnerability in the keyless entry system in many Hondas made between 2012 and 2022. They’ve dubbed the vulnerability Rolling-PWN.
The basic concept for Rolling-PWN is similar to attacks we’ve seen before used against VWs and Teslas, as well as other devices; using radio equipment, someone records a legitimate radio signal from a key fob, then broadcasts it back to the car. It’s...

Has there ever been a better day to get into Nerf? I’m having a hard time thinking of one. Two of the best, most competitive unmodded blasters cost half their normal price today — including the Dart Zone MK-3 and the Nerf Rival Perses — and I’m seeing huge discounts on a bunch of other actually-fun foam throwers as well. 
Just note that you won’t actually find most of these blasters at Amazon. Target and Walmart are holding the best blaster sales, likely in an attempt to draw focus from their competitor.

Dart Zone MK-3 for $65 (normally $130) at Target. The hobby’s never seen a stock blaster like the MK-3 before, pictured atop this story. You get semi-auto AND full-auto; short darts AND long darts; 8AAs or the option of a drop-in...

GameStop is seemingly ignoring that whole ”crypto winter” thing and moving ahead with the launch of its own NFT marketplace, which is now open in what the company calls a “public beta.” 
Right now, you can use the platform to buy, sell, and create NFTs. There are more than 200 collections you can peruse and more than 53,000 NFTs listed on the marketplace. The art I’ve seen seems to be pretty standard NFT fare — in just a few minutes of perusing, I’ve already spotted some some weird cat and monkey-themed collections, for example. Unsurprisingly, you can connect the newly-launched GameStop Wallet to manage your digital assets, though you can also use options like WalletConnect and MetaMask. And not just anyone can create an NFT on the...

Where in the world are Su Zhu and Kyle Davies? The founders of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) are nowhere to be found, according to officials charged with liquidating the bankrupt company (via Reuters). According to a court document filed Friday, Zhu and Davies’ whereabouts are currently unknown, and its liquidators say they have not received “any meaningful cooperation” from the two.
The Singapore-based 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy earlier this month, a move designed to protect foreign companies’ assets from creditors in the US.

The heavily patterned works, which have shifted from functional to decorative, are made by hand-knotting wool and layering the yarn into lush, textured motifs.
Drawing on her background in textile design, Finnish artist Marianne Huotari translates this technique into ceramics, creating densely delicate reliefs that evoke the depth and dimension of fiber. Huotari begins every work with a color palette and surface, whether in the form of a wall-based piece or a freestanding sculpture. More]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、写在前面
北漂快两年整了，经历了一次搬家，换了两次居住环境，这次由于租房合同到期、房东涨价以及疫情小区封控，因此打算换个居住环境。
我对租房的观念一直是这不仅仅只是一个睡觉的地方。不是白天在格子间当了一天社畜，晚上下班回来就只是睡个觉。我觉得租房更多的是在漂泊的城市拥有一个属于自己的家。之前在网上看到一句话很赞同：「你的生活质量也决定着你的生活状态，塑造自己的生活标准，并创造一个优雅、舒适的独处时光吧。」
其实我觉得租房还挺简单的，无非是在通勤、合租还是整租、房租这三个主要因素之间找到平衡。钱到位，什么都不是问题，三环里整租一套也不是梦，所以还是要多赚钱。预算不足的话，只能选择牺牲点什么换取相对优势了。比如我去年租的房就是牺牲了通勤（一天通勤总时长为 2h），但是整租了一套郊区 60 平的一居室大房子，要多舒服有多舒服。
去年找房很顺利，前期准备比较充足，从网上浏览了大量的租房经验帖，再加上好朋友 90 的帮忙，跟着中介只看了一套房就定下了。然后就和 90、阮哥成为了邻居，邻居日常送温暖，搬家最舍不得就是中国好邻居和他们的大金毛了。

二、个人情况
虽然自己房子七月初才到期，但担心疫情又居家隔离不能及时线下看房，加上自己不想拖到后面焦虑，所以我从 6 月初就开始在租房平台上看房，然后挑了个周末线下看了一下午房，一周时间就确定了要租的房子。
因为之前独居一年，经历过三次居家隔离，最长的一次一个月都没有人和我说话，再加上房租涨价，让我这次考虑了合租而不是整租。还有一点是自己整租一居室，发现实际利用率比较高的也就卧室和书桌，而客厅沙发、电视机一年没用过几次，因为公司管三餐所以工作日也不自己做饭，厨房利用率也很低，因此感觉自己整租一居室有点奢侈。而且这次是打算搬到三环、四环附近，之前住郊区五环外进城一趟还是有点麻烦，路上花的时间较多。加上自己并不喜欢自如这种统一的装修风格，也不…]]></summary>

马斯克曾多次公开表示，他希望知道有多少推特账户是由机器人运营的，因为他觉得可疑账户的数量影响了公司的价值。因此他寻求检测和处理虚假账户的方法。当推特最终提供了马斯克明确要求的 8 个开发者 API 的访问权时，这些 API 的速率限制低于推特向其最大企业客户提供的速率限制。马斯克称，这使得他们无法在任何合理的时间内完成数据分析。

许多老的 X.Org 组件在本周末有新的发布

上周末，Oracle 的长期 X.Org 贡献者 Alan Coopersmith 对各种旧的、很少维护的 X.Org 项目发布了许多新的更新。这些软件多年来没有任何更新，新的版本大多只是收集了过去几年中的一些随机修复。总的来说，这些更新并没有什么值得兴奋的改进。

老王点评：这是觉得 X.org 快被放弃了才最后抢救一次？从另外一方面看，可见 X.org 社区有多冷清了。连随手收到的一些修复都懒得发布个新版本。




Linode 现在提供 Kali Linux 实例

Kali Linux 是一个为渗透测试或黑客而设计的 Linux 发行版。这个基于 Debian 的 Linux 是安全研究人员最喜欢的发行版。它现在可以在 Linode 云上使用了，你可以用它来测试和保护你的生产系统。Linode 云是第一个与 Kali Linux 合作的替代云提供商。

老王点评：这是一个跑在公有云上的黑客套装？总觉得哪里不对。]]></summary>

The ribbed, veiny textures of the leaves mimic the reptilian skin of some of the most recognizable characters from the 1993 classic. Minimal in form and lush in construction, the creatures include a dandelion-headed brontosaurus, a stegosaurus with spiky raspberry leaves defining its back, and a velociraptor laced with forget-me-nots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文列出了 2022 年可以用于不同情况的 10 个 Ubuntu 优选应用。


如果你计划永久的转移到 Linux 系统上，你应该会很高兴地知道在 Linux 上有数以千计的能与商业或付费应用媲美的应用。如果你是第一次使用 Linux 的 Windows 用户，你可能都没有听说过这些应用。

因此，在这一系列文章中，我们每一篇重点介绍一组 Ubuntu 应用，以增加 Linux 用户们的协作和认识。

这是 Ubuntu 应用程序系列的第二篇文章，如果你错过了其他部分，可以在这里阅读：


第一篇


1、OBS Studio

第一个应用是著名的 流媒体应用 —— OBS Studio 。这是一款自由开源的应用，主要用于互联网上的流媒体应用。此外，你可以使用该应用创建一个复杂的流媒体项目，包括多源、覆盖式横幅等功能。

而且，由于它能够支持“实时消息传输协议Real-Time Messaging Protocol”（RTMP），你可以使用它在 Facebook、Youtube、Twitch 以及其他支持的平台上进行流式传输。

这个有十年历史的应用程序是 Linux 上最好的应用程序之一。



你可以在 OBS Studio 官网 了解更多的信息并下载，或者通过以下方式安装。

通过 PPA 在 Ubuntu 和相关发行版上安装：

sudo add-apt-repository ppabsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt update
sudo apt install obs-studio


如果你希望通过 Flatpak 安装 ，首先 为 Flatpak 设置系统 然后 通过这个页面安装 。

在 Arch Linux 或者其他 Linux 版本，访问 此页面 了解。

2、Inkscape

Throughout the course of human history, why have some societies endured and evolved while others have struggled and disappeared? According to author Johan Norberg, being "open" might have something to do with it.

If you're an Agile coach, you probably seek to inspire and empower others as an external member of your team or department. However, many Agile coaches overlook the importance of internal cooperation. That's not necessarily a term you are familiar with, so allow me to explain.
What is internal cooperation?
As an Agile coach, you don't work alone. You try to find a partner in the team you're taking care of. This partner is expected to:
Undertake all or most of the Agile transformation in the future.
Find all possible opportunities for systematic improvement and team optimization.
Be self-motivated.
Not be managed by you; you delegate your enthusiasm and vision to th…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://juejin.cn/post/7119103230251892743"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. 背景
在Flutter Test官方的CI方案中，包含UnitTest/WidgetTest/DriverTest三种模式，其中UnitTest/WidgetTest是可以在代码的沙盒环境下运行，而Driver Test需要依赖整包构建；大家都知道在单元测试过程中发现问题成本最低，而整包构建耗时比较久，因此这里介绍一种通用的Flutter Test在CI阶段的方案；
Flutter CI自动化检测能力主要通过FlutterTest能力建设，但具体数据能力建设稍有不足，主要原因是
FlutterTest不支持直接发送一个http请求功能；
以及大量的Channel数据需要主动MOCK，如果大型应用需要mock的太多太杂；
同理可以看在stackoverflow上也有很多人咨询过为什么flutter test环境下无法运行一个HTTP服务请求；

其实分析主要原因是一个在Flutter Test的沙盒环境下，无法运行engine侧很多代码，导致socket服务不能正常发，因此在CI下网络服务是断开的；鉴于此很多mock服务比如flutter mockite就提供一种方案自己维护mock数据，但是这种方式维护成本就非常高了，大家都是程序员，谁也不愿意去维护mock数据，何况业务天天变动情况下；
分析下其思路主要是通过setupMockHttpOverrides覆盖全局的Http，然后将请求服务转接到mock处理逻辑中；
void setupMockHttpOverrides() {
  HttpOverrides.global = MockHttpO…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
在钢笔市场，最能被大家接受的价位在几十块到小几百之间，价位中覆盖了主流的日德钢尖钢笔和少部分入门的14K金笔，从书写体验而言，这些产品已经可以让大家体验到现代钢笔的使用效果，并且相当稳定。
在海外品牌中，日本钢笔是对于初涉钢笔的爱好者们最为友好的产品了，大众款的笔迹细，搭配合适的墨水和纸张，能做到类似中性笔的粗细效果，在新手看重的顺滑度属性方面，日产钢笔也做得相对不错，符合新人对于钢笔的期待。
趣味文具箱整理了1000~3000日元、5000~10000日元、10000日元+三个价位，2022年在日本文具店受欢迎的日本品牌钢笔，下文来看看这些流行的大众款钢笔！
3000日元以下的严选推荐-实用的日本产钢笔

本国生产的钢笔一直是稳定和安心的代名词，2022年，白领们有了在办公室使用钢笔的新风向，大家都希望买到的钢笔有好看的笔杆，尽量不要有廉价感，也只是混在文具盒中，和其它笔类放在一起，预算就是3000日元以下。
目前此定位下最火热的钢笔就是百乐【LIGHTIVE】，型号就是百乐将LIGHT和ACTIVE结合而成创造的一个词汇，设计理念是兼具外观设计性和功能性，方便好用的钢笔，主要的客单目标就是首次在办公室尝试实用钢笔的30~40岁区间的白领们。笔帽内有全新设计的防干盖，可以减少墨水挥发干尖的情况。整笔重量仅仅是12g，非常轻巧，随身携带，大量书写，记录都很合适。在日本的售价是2000日元，价格相当有竞争力。
LIGHTIVE的笔尖和百乐佩尔娜是同款，百乐宣传是特殊合金工艺，有F尖、M尖两个不同的粗细。
笔帽内部设计了防干内帽，相当于白金的滑封气帽技术，但白金专利是内部有弹簧，这个双重帽可以减少笔尖干尖的情况。
笔杆是树脂，漆面装饰，金属件镀黑处理，外观看起来是相当时尚。

在日本上市的这个LIGHTIVE，其实早在19年就在我国上市了，型号叫做冒险者，EXPLORER…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前几天我试图安装 massCode 应用。对于安装，它提供了一个 Snap 文件以供下载。

当我尝试从 Snap 文件安装应用程序时：

sudo snap install snap_file


它给了我以下错误：

error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap "masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap"




这很奇怪。在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 时，你必须添加 GPG 密钥。但是这里的开发人员没有提供这样的东西。

“修复”简单易行。让我给你解释一下。

处理 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 错误

这里其实不涉及签名。

发生的情况是你从第三方下载了 Snap 安装程序。 Ubuntu 中的 Snap 机制希望你从官方 Snap 商店获取 Snap 包。

由于它不是来自 Snap 商店，因此你会看到 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 的错误消息。与大多数错误消息一样，这个错误消息不是描述性的。

那么，这里的解决方案是什么？

任何未通过 Snap 商店分发的 Snap 包都必须使用 --dangerous 选项进行安装。这就是规则。

sudo snap install --dangerous path_to_snap_file


这样，你告诉 Snap 包管理器显式安装 Snap 包。

在这里，我使用了这个选项并且能够成功地从它的 Snap 包中安装 massCode。



以这种方式安装 Snap 包有多“危险”？几乎和下载并 安装 deb 格式安装包 相同。

在我看来，如果你是从项目开发者的网站上下载 Snap 包，你已经在信任该项目了。在这种情况下，你可以使用 --dangerous 选项安装它。

当然，你应该首先搜索该软件包是否在 Snap 商店中可用：

snap find package_name


我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你修复 Snap 错误。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。如果你想了解更多信息，请参阅 这个使用 Snap 命令指南。

线上 App 某个版本之后，服务端同学从埋点数据中发现一个奇怪的现象：“所有界面的 Activity.onPause() 过后，得等 10 秒整，才回调 Activity.onStop()。”
这么扯吗？是不是统计数据有问题？
怎么可能？Activity 生命周期是系统控制的呀？
为啥是如此诡异，正正好好的 10 秒？
App 岂不是会很卡？ANR 蹭蹭往上？
从哪切入排查？
接手该问题后，一连串问号涌现。。。
检测 & 复现
在一口闷三杯咖啡之后，我决定。。先上个厕所。（咖啡利尿）
定神之后，我做出了一个关键决定：先稳定复现问题。这是修复任何问题的第一步。
于是乎写出了这样的检测代码：

去年7月份我发布了 《维护两个10k+Star的Github项目，会遇到什么有趣的问题》 的相关吐槽，当时 JYM 看得还是挺乐呵的，时隔一年之后，让我们来看看又有什么充满“智慧”的问题，为你展示真实高 Star 开源项目维护者的心路历程。
注意⚠️：阅读本文可能会浪费您宝贵的 5 分钟，本篇主要是吐槽和分享过去一年维护 Github 项目以来的一些有趣的经历，所以阅读本文并不会增长你的技术，但是如果你想做开源，想了解开源项目维护者的心理，那可能会给你带来一些启发😊。
其实参与开源这么多年，相信大家都有所体会，特别是 Android 开发，在经历了曾经 Android 开源的辉煌时代之后，如今还在坚持的人真的不多，不说还维护开源项目，就说还在单纯从事 Android 开发的也不多了，从  AndroidGithubBoss 项目的统计上看，排名前 10 还在维护的纯 Android 开源项目寥寥无几，可以看到几乎都是金色的 Deprecated 状态。

为什么呢？首先是现在的 Android 项目获取流量的能力已经大幅度下降，官方 Jetpack 体系的成熟也挤压了第三方开源项目的市场。
另外，虽然做开源项目至今也有 7 年了，但是每次打开 Github 的通知中心，看到这样的场景时都难免会心颤一下，因为对于个人开源维护者来说，Github 的小蓝点有时候就像是“催命符“，有时候可能都很急，在等着救命。

个人开源项目的优势就是灵活，当你需要什么东西，可以让维护者快速更新发布；但是缺点也是很明显，就是个人的精力和时间十分有限。
有时候用户着急的情绪会体现在标题上，但是其实当我看到  issue 时可能已经是隔天了，而事实上很多 issue 如果对方能稍微花点时间，看看文档或者 issue 模版上的链接，我想可能都不需要等我的回复。

来自俄罗斯的 Astra Linux 是 Debian 的下游发行版，它已经存在了一些年，除了 x86、Arm 等 CPU 架构外，它还支持 MIPS 架构。它是由 RusBITech 开发的，是专门为俄罗斯军队设计的。微软已经阻止了 Windows 在俄罗斯的使用，这似乎大大有助于推动替代操作系统的采用。路透社报道说，RosBITech 正计划在莫斯科证券交易所上市，估值约折合为 2.6 亿美元。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我觉得他们比较谦虚，要是搞个根社区可能估值更高呢。




KDE Plasma 5.26 有望使用 C++20 进行开发

在即将到来的 KDE Plasma 5.26 桌面环境中，KDE 开发者正考虑使用 C++20 语言开发后续功能，尤其是使用 C++ 协同例程支持特性。随着时间的推移，这种较新的 C++ 语言也会用于其他 KDE 组件。将 C++ 要求提升到 C++20 意味着将 KDE 编译器要求提高到 GCC 10 或 Clang 11，而这些版本的编译器已经稳定发布两年了。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看来最近各个开源项目都在逐渐迁移到新的语言标准和新的编译器了，这种稳健而进步的态度是开源的生命力。




RISC-V 仅用 12 年达成百亿核心里程碑

在近日召开的 Embedded World 大会上，RISC-V 国际的 CEO 宣布目前 RISC-V 市场上的核心数量已经突破 100 亿。CEO 认为开放标准是关键，“Linux 在为软件所做的事情，和我们为硬件所做的事情有异曲同工之妙。”RISC-V 是一种开放标准指令集架构（ISA），根据开源许可提供。据悉，ARM 架构经过 17 年，在 2008 年实现了这个里程碑。而 RISC-V 只用了 12 年就完成了这一目标。


消息来源：WCCF Tech



老王点评：看来 RISC-V 真能复制 Linux 在软件方面的成功啊。]]></summary>

二十万级别房车——便宜大碗，房的部分空间配置等大幅提升，但车的部分依然拉胯；
三十万级别房车——主流之选，大部分房车消费者选购房车都会考虑的一个价位，不论房的部分还是车的部分都有了实际的提升，但还是存在部分硬伤，比如房的部分不够高级、品质一般；车的部分配置较低、甚至还有手动挡；
而到了四十万这个级别，当房车厂商不用那么严苛地控制成本时，终于出现了许多够实用、够个性、有品质的房车，事实上，这也是房车车型最多的一个价位，可见放开成本的手脚后，房车市场终于可以百花齐放、各显神通。
这篇文章我们就来看看四款这个价位比较有代表性的车型。
一：通过性强、硬升顶：途酷神行太保 （指导价 39.8 万）

​
​
软升顶的房车之前介绍过几款，而硬升顶的房车市面上其实很少，其成本要远高于软升顶结构，在保温、隔热、隔音、安全性等方面都要更强。
途酷这款硬升顶皮卡房车采用五十铃D-MAX底盘，越野能力较出色；外观线条硬朗，采用黑灰配色的磨砂质感外观，升顶后全车尺寸5580x2110x2143mm，降下车顶高度为2060mm，可以通过大部分限高和地下车库。虽然是皮卡底盘，但改装成房车后行驶本上是小型旅居车手续，没有报废年限。车身箱体材料是采用三明治板，升顶为螺杆机构，可以通过遥控来控制升高高度，还能随时暂停；车门在升降过程中也能随时开合。相较于软升顶，硬升顶机构的好处是在较低时速时可以不降下顶棚，坏处是整个结构比较重，使得整车质量达到2742kg。

​
​
车身外侧有配220V电源插座的抽拉式燃气灶台，盖板可以当做操作台使用；另一侧是黑水箱装卸口、尿素加注口、220V市电充电口和储物箱。车头内部还融合了一盏野外探照灯。

底盘方面搭载1.9T柴油发动机，最大功率163马力、峰值扭矩360牛米，配备爱信6AT自动挡，标配分时四驱、定速巡…]]></summary>

当使用 C 编程语言编写一个应用程序时，你的代码通常有多个源文件代码。

最终，这些文件必须被编译到一个单个的可执行文件之中。你可以通过创建静态或动态库（后者也被称为 共享shared 库）来实现这一点。这两种类型的库在创建和链接的方式上有所不同。两者都有缺点和优点，这取决于你的使用情况。

动态链接是最常见的方法，尤其是在 Linux 系统上。动态链接会保持库模块化，因此，很多应用程序可以共享一个库。应用程序的模块化也允许单独更新其依赖的共享库。

在这篇文章中，我将演示动态链接是如何工作的。在后期的文章中，我将演示静态链接。

链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的数个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名为可执行文件executable的可以运行的程序。在你创建一个动态链接的可执行文件前，你需要一些用来链接的库，和一个用来编译的应用程序。准备好你 最喜欢的文本编辑器 并继续。

创建目标文件

首先，创建带有这些函数签名的头文件 mymath.h ：

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：

今天为大家带来关于家庭装修过程中的网线布局，以及使用mesh组网完成全屋WiFi覆盖的实战教程，全文7000余字，建议收藏后慢慢阅读~
关注我，后续分享更多有趣的内容~
前言
通过站内大佬孜孜不倦的科普，大家已经逐步认识到，对于大平层、跃层、多层别墅等大面积的户型，想要提高家中WiFi信号的覆盖效果，实现WiFi漫游，目前有AC+AP以及MESH组网两种主流方案。
毕竟国家对无线路由器的信号发射功率进行了限制，哪怕是价格大几千的顶级路由，面对多重承重墙和复杂户型，在信号覆盖方面也是巧妇难为无米之炊。
AC+AP方案主要应用在企业级无线组网领域，虽然目前有大厂也推出了家用场景下的AC+AP方案，但是还是存在着诸如必须提前埋布网线，AP面板发热降频、整体价格较高等问题。
相比之下，MESH组网的方式，更适合家用环境。组网方案非常灵活，设置难度较小，性价比更高。特别是对于家中没有预埋网线的情况，MESH组网基本上是实现全屋WiFi覆盖和漫游的唯一选择。
以我自家为例，原本使用华硕AX86U+2个AC66U B1组合的aimesh2.0方案，其中AX86U作为主路由承担PPPOE拨号任务，AC66U B1作为MESH节点负责扩展WiFi信号的覆盖面积。
这套方案实际运行起来挺稳的，但是有个最大问题，华硕aimesh2.0技术在WiFi6和WiFi5路由器混合组网的情况下，无法使用AX86U的WiFi6 160mHz频段，难以发挥出全部性能，感觉实在是浪费。
听群里老哥说过，领势是做了30多年的老牌路由器厂商，一直是MESH技术的开拓者和领头羊，以安装和组网方便著名因此今年趁着618活动，给自家更换成了领势Velop MX2003这套WiFi6的MESH系统。
什么是MESH组网？

MESH的本意就是网状，理想状态下，MESH网络中所有的节点都可以互相连通，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为小米冲击高端的第 3 年、第 4 个系列，12S 系列凭借着「徕卡影像」的亮点可谓赚足了眼球。我也第一时间到小米之家把玩了真机，虽然质感有进步，但整体的感觉依然很小米，硬件设计依然没有延续性可言，好在高通这代处理器终于把功耗拿捏住了（比去年 11 Ultra 明显发热卡住好太多了）。
不过我今年依然不会选购小米旗舰，因为小米始终没有解决一个问题：R角设计。

声明：我并没有相关的从业背景，所以并不清楚更专业且准确地描述这个问题，只能从普通消费者的角度形容这个问题。如有描述错误，请见谅。

R 角设计是指什么？
R角：R是圆角， Radius，指內圆弧角或外圆弧角。在手机硬件上看 R角设计的好坏时，我会把机身弧角、屏幕弧角放在一起看，因为这本质上就是把圆角放在其他圆角里。
我们先来看看小米12S Ultra 的 R角设计：

很明显，小米12S Ultra 的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率并不连续（有曲面屏的影响），也并非同心圆的关系，两个圆角曲率处有着奇怪的「畸形」。虽然这一代比小米11 Ultra 进步很多，但观感上依然别扭。

而我眼中正确的 R 角设计，代表性的有苹果 iPhone 的全面屏机型、三星S22、谷歌 Pixel 5等，它们的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率连续，且处于同心圆的位置，看起来有秩序且耐看。苹果甚至还把这种「讲究」运用在了软件硬件的结合上，比如 iPhone 全面屏版本界面底部专属的 Dock 栏，以及 Dock 栏的图标与机身机身弧角、屏幕弧角完美呼应：
真的让人感觉十分舒适。图/ carlosnuila
值得一提的是，iPhone 12 系列回归直角边框设计后， 苹果还将该设备上运行的 iOS 版本进行了 R 角微调，即便它和  iPhone X、iPhone 11 系列都是运行同样的 iOS 系统，但机身硬件外观圆角曲率产生了变化，「执拗」的苹果就在软件上准备了两种完全不同的圆角曲率分别与不同机身外观进行更好地呼应。

R 角设计做好，意味着什么？
可能很多朋友会认为，R角的设计无关紧要，只是像我这类的人过于吹毛求疵。
我尊重这个观点，因为多数设备的 R 角设计问题确实没那么重要。比如小米12S Ultra 这款机器整体表现出众，但它硬件设计缺乏的延续性、高端旗舰缺乏的精致感等问题，远比解决 R 角设计重要得多。
但就我个人角度而言，手机是我每天接触最长的电子设备，而且这几年手机迭代升级提升有限，更换周期比以往慢了许多，所以我更在乎手机的外在形象和整体体验。
手机在进入全面屏设计以后，我觉得是一个技术革命的开始，因为它让手机屏幕需要与边框之间的边界进一步缩小，达到一种近似融合的境界。

而优秀的 R 角设计，能让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，让屏幕与外壳间连接更趋向自然，让用户不能轻易感受到边界的存在，完全沉浸其中。反观设计不太好的 R 角，即便也有全面屏设计带来的震撼观感，但日常使用时也总能轻而易举感受到屏幕与外壳两者曲率处存在着奇怪的「畸形」，让技术革命带来的沉浸感始终不够彻底。
让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，这一项看似简单的设计，背后也都蕴藏着大量的技术成本，比如 OLED 屏幕的切割和折叠、电路面板的堆叠技术、圆角处的次像素反走样渲染、严格的界面 UI 设计规范等等。
最后，我很希望后续小米能够重视 R 角的设计，早日推出更棒的旗舰产品。因为我始终觉得，手机进入全面屏时代后，手机同质化越来越严重，最美的「风景」不是莱卡蔡司等相机品牌的联名、不是越来越窄的边框、不是越来越快的快充技术、不是越拍越远的长焦，而是来自 2017 年 iPhone X 那张让人完全沉浸其中的全面屏设计宣传图：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
现在Omnifocus的收集任务的方式，总体还算方便。
在mac上支持快捷键呼出小窗口快速录入，如下图所示：
Omnifocus的快捷任务窗口
在iPhone上也可以使用Quick Entry快速录入。
长按Omnifocus呼出Quick Entry
按理来说，这些入口完全足够日常的收集，但是我总感觉还差点火候，那就是不够智能。
萌发
为什么会觉得Omnifocus的任务收集方式不够智能呢？因为我自己经常和Siri互动，比如让Siri帮我安排一个日程，手机上，让Siri提醒我安排一个待办事项（可以导入到Omnifocus）。这种自然的文字或语言的交互，让我觉得非常高效和符合直觉。
让我们看看具体的演示
首先一起来看看电脑端安排一个日程
Siri自动根据输入的文字，安排日程
我们可以看到，Siri很智能就识别出了下周二的日期和时间，并帮我添加了一个日程。使用Siri交互，省去了打开日历，选择日期，输入内容的繁琐过程。
然后让我们看看移动端如何使用Siri记录待办事项
通过输入文字和Siri交互SIri完成任务到提醒事项的收集打开Omnifocus自动捕捉系统提醒事项的内容
整体链路如下：

呼出Siri，并输入你的任务
Siri自动识别日期和任务
提醒事项添加到系统中
打开Omnifocus
Omnifocus自动导入系统的提醒事项

要启用Omnifocus的捕捉功能，需要在Omnifocus中做一下简单的配置。
Omnifocus配置自动捕获提醒事项
上面两个Demo都非常好，不过关键问题来了，mac上的Omnifocus不支持导入提醒事项。有朋友可能会想，那很简单啊，手机上打开Siri录入任务，然后导入到Omnifocus同步，mac端的问题不就解决了？
如果在mac上智能录入待办事项，需要用如此冗长的链路，我会选择放弃。实际在电脑工作的时候，面对突然插入的事项，我需要快速记录。一般情况下不会那么悠闲地打开手机去分心记录。
大家都是成年人了，可以全都要吗？可以。
落地
既然全都要，那我来落地一下自己的想法吧。
这个痒点需求自然不能占用我太多时间去处理，经过最偷懒原则出发的摸索，我发现快捷指令，支持提取文本里面的日期和时间。那剩下的问题就非常简单了，我们直接花一点碎片时间写一个快捷指令出来智能收集任务到Omnifocus里面就行了。
感兴趣的朋友可以看看下图，核心原理就是用“记得”为关键字做切割，将带有时间的任务收集到Omnifocus。
写完之后我都懒得看的快捷指令详情
好的，最后让我们看看成果
打开快捷指令的Input弹窗Omnifocus中的收件箱已经安排好时间
通过编写这样的一个快捷指令，让mac端的Omnifocus增加了智能识别时间录入任务的能力。
这个只是我自己在完善Ominfocus工具使用体验的一个小思路。我相信很多的任务管理工具可能已经有很好的语音识别功能，也许你也用不上，但是了解了快捷指令可以智能提取文本中的时间，可能可以给你的工作流带来一定的帮助。
总结
在我自己的工作流沉淀过程中，我比较关心工作本身是否足够流畅且不分心。我会以此为前提去充分探索和优化。至于打磨工具本身，是一个必然会经历的过程。方法论和工具本身没有高下之分，二者不可偏废。我一直提醒自己，不要只了解方法论去盖空中楼阁，更不要在工具细节中忘了自己要去哪里。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。




Meta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。

现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。

（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）

Meta 试图不落下任何语言




目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。

虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。

因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。

NLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。

正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！

为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。

你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。

对社会事业的鼓励

Meta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。

项目的影响

尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。

许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。

你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？

为了不让文章看上去过于枯燥，笔者考虑了一下，特意增加了碎碎谈环节！自从上次这篇文章发出去后  黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！，就挺受读者欢迎的呀，收藏数大于点赞数是什么鬼，嘿嘿！从我的角度出发，本来Signal出发的目的就是想建造一个类似于安全气囊的装置，保证crash后第一时间重启恢复，达到一个应用稳定的目的，但是慢慢写着写着，发现很多crash监控平台的也是用了相同的核心原理（大部分还没开源噢），只是作用的目标不同，那么为什么不把Signal打造成一个通用的基础件呢！无论是安全气囊还是监控，其实都是上层的应用不同罢了！嗯！有了这个想法之后，给Signal补充一些日志监控逻辑，就更加完善了！所以就有了本篇文章！算是一个补充文！如果没看过黑科技！让Native Crash 与ANR无处发泄！这篇文章的新朋友，请先阅读！（如果没有ndk开发经验也没关系，里面也不涉及很复杂的c知识）
获取堆栈
获取堆栈！可能很多新朋友看到这个就会想，这有什么难的嘛！直接new 一个Throwable获取不就可以了嘛，或者Thread.currentThread().stackTrace（kotlin）等等也可以呀！嗯！是的！我们在java层通常会有很固定的获取堆栈方式，这得益于java虚拟机的设计，也得益于java语言的设计，因为屏蔽了多平台底层的差异，我们就可以用相对统一的api去获取当前的堆栈。这个堆栈也特指java虚拟机堆栈！
但是对于native的堆栈，问题就来了！我们知道native层通常跟很多因素有关，比如链接器，编译器，还有各种库的版本，各种abi等等影响，获取一个堆栈消息，可没有那么简单，因为太多因素干扰了，这也是历史的包袱！还有对于我们android来说，android官方在对堆栈获取的方式，也是有历史变化的

Pluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。

Ubuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍

Canonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。

老王点评：总算是又进一步改善了 Snap，虽然还有一些缺陷。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[房车生活是许多人向往的事情，不过一辆优质的房车价格不菲，而且目前房车市场也不像家用车一样可以方便地试乘试驾，因为有全国连锁4S店的房车厂屈指可数。所以当你有迈入房车生活计划的时候，不妨先挑一个假期，先租上几天玩玩，看看房车的驾驶体验和使用体验你能否接受、房车中的诸多不便你能否克服、房车生活是否真的能给你带来更多快乐。
那么最重要的问题来了：怎么租？
一：可信的房车租赁平台
首先是大家都很熟悉的携程，App首页里就有租车频道，很多热门旅游城市都有房车可以选择。​

​
 

​
​​我没在携程租过房车，但在不同城市租过十几次其他车型，总体的服务是满意的，由于有携程平台的监管，租赁公司也不太敢玩套路，而且他们普遍很在乎你在携程的评价，会尽力服务好你，有一次我还车时车身有一条很细的划痕，车商让我给个好评就不用我赔偿了。
但在下订单前最好浏览一下评论，如果差评很多可以换一家车商。
在携程租车的另一个好处是免费取消时间、不同档次的保险费用和权益都会清晰标注，可以按需选择，比如对驾驶有信息，就买个基础险，小事故需要自己理赔；如果技术一般，或者去的地方路况比较差，可以购买全险，出任何大小事故都是由车商处理，很省心。
类似的还有飞猪、马蜂窝等平台。
第二个推荐是上汽大通集团的官方房车租赁平台。
上汽大通是国内比较少见的汽车主机厂原厂改装房车的厂商，实力比大部分房车厂都雄厚。而它也有自己的房车租赁服务平台：“房车生活家租房车”小程序。

​
由于汽车主机厂自营的优势，可以利用其4S店网络进行服务，所以覆盖的城市比较多，而且所租的车型很齐全、车况好，甚至一些特色车型是外面平台租不到的。
这个小程序还可以方便地找到房车营地，基本覆盖了全国主要的房车营地和小车露营地，对于上汽大通合作的营地还可以方便地查看水电、停车收费情况和环境、玩乐项目，非常有心。

​
二：其他平台​
​如果你对自己的鉴别能力有信心，其实也可以尝试在万能的“闲鱼”寻找出租的房车，其实有很多规模很小的租车公司都会在闲鱼发布信息，价格会比在平台上便宜一点，覆盖的城市也更多。​
​但一定要鉴别对方是否有合法的租赁手续，必要时让提供出示营业执照等信息，而且一定要签好合同。
​

​
但​闲鱼的监管作用有限，不推荐没有经验的玩家尝试，在此仅作一个补充渠道供大家参考。
​三：车型怎么选​
​房车类型主要是C型和B型，C型的空间大，装载能力强，配置和储物空间更丰富，适合多人使用，但是驾驶起来不是很方便，比如在城区穿行、停车时都不太灵活，如果开省道、乡道，很多限高杆也会过不去；而B型房车的空间比较小，适合两个人使用，但开起来比较灵活，能通过更多的限高杆。C型车的租金一天在1200-1500元左右，B型车在700-1000元左右。
​如果你对房车的舒适性要求比较高，或者带着一家老小，也可以选择带拓展的房车，驻车时可以获得更大的生活空间，当然，租金方面也会更贵一些。​

​
​四：配置方面要注意什么
​不管你是为了购置房车前先体验，还是为了偶尔出游，租房车时一定要注意所选车型的配置，不然会大幅降低你的房车使用舒适性，进而对房车有所误解。
​最常见的问题就是租赁商没给你提供马桶降解剂、房车电器设施不足、缺乏充电设施。
​很多没接触过房车的人会误以为房车的马桶要自己倾倒未经处理的排泄物，其实房车马桶是要配合降解剂使用的，经过降解后，马桶里的东西就会变成无臭的绿水，不会很恶心（但会有降解剂本身特殊的味道）。
​一些租赁商的房车是低配车，生活电瓶容量很小，逆变器功率也不大，不仅用不了微波炉、电磁炉、空调等大功率设备，而且很快就会缺电，这会大幅降低使用体验，务必要询问清楚电瓶容量和逆变器功率。对于空调，尽量选择有220V车载空调或家用空调的房车，效果会更好。
​有大电池却缺乏充电手段也不行。很多车型只能用底盘车自带的小功率行车发电机、太阳能和外接电进行充电，这三种方式充电效率都非常低，无法满足使用。尽量选择有大功率行车发电和支持快充的房车，前者发动车辆后可以在两三小时内充满电，不心疼油费；后者可以利用现在越来越密布的充电桩充电，当然，不要影响到电动车主的充电哦。​
​其他生活配置大多房车都会配好，比如热水器、暖气、床单被褥等，如果需要用到锅碗瓢盆可以提前问问是否提供，不提供就得自己带上了。​
​其他方面和租赁普通家用车流程是一样的，都要准备好驾照、身份证、预授权的信用卡或支付宝等。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[沙牛提示

阅读本文需要 3 分钟，安利我的新玩意儿——一台超迷你主机！ 
如果你喜欢本文，就分享给你的小伙伴！

01 需求
最近几年，对电子产品的欲望降低了很多。不过，两个月前，我萌生了弄一台办公小主机的需求。
其实，对于电脑，我一直没有太高的需求，不看 4K，更不玩游戏，最复杂最耗资源的需求，那就是视频剪辑了。
不过，我的视频剪辑需求，也算是非常入门了——只是使用 Camtasia 来完成课程视频的剪辑工作。
之前使用的电脑，都是笔记本：一台 Macbook Pro，一台华为。但因为办公升降桌很小，笔记本 + 带鱼屏往上一放，就更打挤了。
所以，迷你主机的需求，就这样诞生了。之所以需要迷你，是因为我不希望它太占空间，不然还不如继续用笔记本呢。
02 选品
最初，我本打算入手 Mac Mini，下单之前，顺手看了下 MacBuyer's Guide（一个提供 Apple 家产品购买建议和指南的网站）：

好家伙，这一代 Mac Mini 已经发布 604 天，而平均更新周期为 634 天，所以，网站直接给打上了” 不要购买 “的标签：

我可不想前脚刚原价购买，后脚就上了新一代产品。所以，果断放弃。
然后，逛张大妈的时候，无意间发现这么个玩意儿：

这玩意儿叫DeskMini，看了一下详细介绍，机箱只有 1.9L，甚至比一瓶拉罐可乐大不了多少，嗯，尺寸似乎正合我意！
但这只是一个机箱 + 主板的准系统，我得自己另行购买 CPU、内存和硬盘。
挑选了一下，粗略计算了个总价，似乎能控制在 3500 以内，ok，下手！

于是，我就这样用上了人生中的第一台迷你组装机。
03 装机
准系统拿下，实际到手价格 909，包含机箱、电源、主板和风扇，另外还有一个无线网卡。
然后查了不少资料，确定下AMD R5600G这款 CPU，散片 1089 拿下！
硬盘不用太大，毕竟我有 NAS 服务器，所以，1TB 的铠侠 NVME 固态，527 拿下！
内存么，之前的电脑都是 16G，剪视频 + 开虚拟机的情况下，有些捉襟见肘，所以，怎么也得上 32G 吧…… 最后，654，拿下两条 16G 镁光 DDR4 3200。
然后，查了一下自带的无线网卡，最高速度 433 Mbps，岂不是让我的 NAS 毫无用武之地？怎么也处上 2.5G 无线网络吧？
好的，AX210 无线网卡安排上！拼多多 75 到手！
所有配件到齐，装机——

不得不说，第一次自己装机，我是真的手残，找了 N 个视频，折腾了两个小时，终于给装上了……

是真的很小，比我 500ml 的茶杯大不了多少，放桌面上毫无违和感。
04 体验
然后，重新整理桌面空间、开机、装上 Win11，常用的软件装上，测试视频编码。
旧的电脑，视频编码 CPU 占用直接狂飙到 100%，这小主机，占用率一起处于 60% 左右。
内存也一直没用到一半。

真香！
甚至，几年不玩游戏的我，还特意下载了 Steam，入手了地平线 5……
没错，集显玩地平线 5！

开低画质（第二档，下面还有极低），挺流畅的，不过没有测试帧率。
到这一步，我只能说：

AMD Yes!

05 再次折腾
用了一周之后，我发现一个严重的问题：

CPU 温度时常接近 70 度。

作为一名完美主义者，这能忍？
所以，我又萌生了换个散热器的想法。
因为主机太小，所以最高仅支持 46mm 的散热器。
所以，103，拿下这个规格的利民散热器！
安装安装安装……

不得不再次吐槽，我手是真的残，换个散热器，又搞了两个钟头……
而且因为底部螺丝拧得太紧，主板都给干弯了……
好了，温度果然下降了好几度，舒服了！
再后来，我又发现，这主机虽小，但扩展性还挺高：居然支持同时插上两块 NVME 硬盘、两块 2.5 寸 SATA 硬盘。
好的，继续拆！
把我闲置的 SATA 固态给装上当下载盘。
不得不说，手残归手残，折腾是真的爽啊！
06 结语
后面又买了一些小玩意儿，汇总一下这次折腾的总费用——

3400 不到的一台小主机，既能满足我办公的所有需求，又满足了自己折腾的欲望，何乐而不为呢？
因为机箱超小的关系，即便淘汰以后，还能做一台 HTPC 或者远程访问主机，多香呀~]]></summary>

前言
继续我们 Flutter 绘图相关的介绍，本篇我们引入一位重量级主角 —— 灭霸。通过绘图的颜色过滤器，我们要给灭霸点颜色看看。通过本篇，你会了解到如下内容：
ColorFilter 颜色过滤器的介绍；
彩色图片转换为灰度图；
通过矩阵运算构建自定义的颜色过滤器。
ColorFilter 颜色过滤器
其实我们之前在给小姐姐的照片调个颜色滤镜有介绍过颜色滤镜，在 Flutter 中提供了一个 ColorFiltered 的组件，可以将颜色过滤器应用到其子组件上。实际上，颜色过滤器就是对一个图层的每个像素的颜色（包括透明度）进行数学运算，改变像素的颜色来实现特定的效果。数学公式如下：

在 Flutter 中，ColorFilter 类的继承自 ImageFilter，像 ImageFilter 一样，也只提供了命名构造函数，一共有四个命名构造函数，分别如下：
ColorFilter.mode(Color color, BlendMode mode)：按制定的混合模式（blend mode），将颜色混入到绘制的目标中。可以理解为图像的色值调整，我们可以用一个指定的颜色调整原图，调整的模式有很多种，具体可以查看 BlendMode 枚举。
ColorFilter.linearToSrgbGamma()：将一个 SRGB 的 gamma 曲线应用到 RGB 颜色通道中。
ColorFilter.srgbToLinearGamma()：ColorFilter.linearToSrgbGamma()的反向过程。
ColorFilter.matrix(List matrix)：应用一个矩阵做颜色变换，也就是我们上面说的矩阵，这是最通用的版…]]></summary>

The Free Software Foundation (FSF) started promoting the idea of sharing code way back in 1985, and since then it's defended the rights of computer users and developers. The FSF says that the terms "open" and "closed" are not effective words when classifying software, and instead considers programs either freedom-respecting ("free" or "libre") or freedom-trampling ("non-free" or "proprietary"). Whatever terminology you use, the imperative is that computers must belong, part and parcel, to the users, and not to the corporations that owns the software the computers run. This is why the GNU Project, and the Linux kernel, Freedesktop.org, and so many ot…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如图所示，这满满的一背包现金，是我有生以来第一次摸过这么多钱，大概四十万左右，真的相当有份量。2017 年，我在微博发出这张照片的时候，大家都纷纷羡慕，以为是用来发奖金的，看来少数派是发财了，甚至连银行的营业员都变得十分热情，指望着我多买点理财产品。但实际上，这是我用个人信用担保，借出来的第一笔高额贷款，是用来保障少数派接下来两个月的工资和运营成本。
这可能就是「钱」的双面性，我们不能只用数量和数字来定夺结论，还要知道钱的来源和用法。很长一段时间，都有很多用户问我们：少数派靠什么赚钱，能赚到钱吗？这可能是理想主义之外，大家最关心的话题，我这里具体说说吧。
理想中的内容付费
我们想象中最理想的赚钱方式，当然是「内容付费」，我们从 2013 年就开始给作者发稿酬，从一年 20 万，到现在每年超过 100 万。作者提供有价值的内容，用户为内容付钱，逻辑很简单，但实操非常难。尽管已经十年了，有付费习惯的用户依然是小众群体，而作者分享的内容，也不一定对所以用户都有价值，匹配和触达目标用户的成本也越来越高。
所以我们先尝试推出了「付费栏目」，把聚焦一个领域的系列内容变成付费阅读，跟软件工具结合，涵盖设计、编程、信息等诸多方法论。我们今年也在迭代栏目，比如以年度为单位，从原来的纯内容付费，增加了在线沙龙、实操任务等更丰富的形式。我们的目的是希望通过这些栏目，帮助用户沉淀和成长。但这毕竟是一种逆反人性的学习模式，付费栏目尽管也做了五年，这部分收入也只能占 10%，并且有大部分收入要分给作者和开发者。
这期间，能赚钱的付费内容，大多是普世性的，比如缓解时代焦虑的成功学，刺激底层人性网络小说，但从长期价值角度，我们不想也不善于赚这个钱。所以从赚钱层面，我非常不成功，也冒出过放弃的念头。但总有用户会回来告诉我们，通过学习少数派某个栏目，对它的职场和人生带来了重要帮助，此时我们又更加笃定，要坚持做…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portland, Oregon-based artist Lana Crooks (previously) juxtaposes the softness of wool and silk with the solid, unyielding surfaces of bones. She stitches hand-dyed textiles into anatomical sculptures adorned with colorful florals or feathers that are both elegant and eerie. Often encased in glass domes, Crooks’s recent skeletal works include a hand wrapped in a loose bouquet, an ouroboros entwined with a blossoming vine, and a human ribcage suspended in an ornately carved wooden box.

These passersby become the initial inspiration for the artist’s figurative cardboard sculptures, which consider his Chinese heritage, his parent’s immigration, and what it means to hold a diasporic identity. More]]></summary>

Knowing how much of your disk is being used by your files is an important consideration, no matter how much storage you have. My laptop has a relatively small 250GB NVME drive. That's okay most of the time, but I began to explore gaming on Linux a couple of years ago. Installing Steam and a few games can make storage management more critical.
The du command
The easiest way to examine what's left for storage on your disk drive is the du command. This command line utility estimates file space usage. Like all Linux tools, du is very powerful, but knowing how to use it for your particular needs is helpful. I always consult the man page for any utility. This specific tool has several swit…]]></summary>

A typical computer keyboard has only about 100 keys on it.
Most keys double up on characters, also called glyphs, thanks to the Shift key. Glyphs are frequently used to type letters with accents and umlauts, to produce characters used in mathematic or monetary expressions, or just to add fun emojis. In some regions there are even three glyphs available on select keys.
Regardless of your region, however, some glyphs don't make it onto your keyboard. Fortunately, Linux provides access to these through a compose key.
There's no compose key on your keyboard, at least not by default, but you can designate a key you're not otherwise using as your compose key. I use the Alt key to t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、适配的目的
区别于iOS，android设备有不同的分辨率大小以及不同厂商的系统，目前市场的分辨率可以看下友盟的相关统计。

可以看到主流的分辨率有10多种，当不做适配时，一套代码在不同设备上的效果偏大、偏小、截断以及留白严重，那一套代码如何完美的展示在不同的设备上，可以看下面的一些适配方案。
二、UI适配
2.1、常见的适配方式
2.1.1、xml布局控件适配
避免写死View的宽高，尽量使用warp_content和match_parent；
父布局为LinearLayout，选择使用android:layout_weight属性，为布局中的每个子View设置权重；
父布局为RelativeLayout，可以选择使用layout_centerInParent等属性，设置子View的相对位置；
谷歌官方在之前版本中提供了一个百分比布局方式：support:percent，它支持RelativeLayout和FrameLayout的百分比布局，但是目前官方已经不再维护，而将他取而代之的是新晋布局：ConstraintLayout，ConstraintLayout强大之处不仅在于它能够进行百分比布局，还可以进行相对定位、角度定位、尺寸约束、宽高比、Chainl链布局等，在不同设备间都能处理的游刃有余。
2.1.2、图片适配
.9图
见2.1.4分辨率限定符；
2.1.3、依据产品设计适配
所谓产品设计适配，指的是产品流程在不同设备上有不同的展示方式，例如手机与Pad的区别，在手机设备上，一般来说具体Item列表是一个页面，点击每个Item会跳转至新的详情页；而在宽度>高度的Pad上，为了防止页面空白浪费，一般会要求屏幕左侧为Item列表，右侧即详情页，item与详情页会同时出现在用户的视觉内，如下图

关于这种类型的设计，其实郭霖《第一行代码》给出了一个方案，我在这里抛砖…]]></summary>

软件测试简介
​软件测试是伴随着软件开发一同诞生的，随着软件规模大型化，结构复杂化，软件测试也从最初的简单“调试”，发展到当今的自动化测试。
​自动化测试是什么呢？自动化测试是把以人为驱动的测试行为转化为机器执行的一种过程，自动化测试通常会借助某些工具或者框架。虽然不能完全取代手工测试，但相比手工测试来讲，自动化测试可以减少人力成本，降低重复工作，从而更快速、高效的进行测试活动。
​测试金字塔是一种自动化测试过程的金字塔形策略结构，用来指导软件开发过程中各层测试投入的工作量比例，其最早由Mike Cohn在2009年的著作《Scrum敏捷软件开发》中提出。Mike Cohn在书中指出：测试金字塔从上到下分为三层，分别是UI测试、服务/接口测试、单元测试，越接近金字塔底部的测试活动，投入的工作量应该越多，即单元测试投入工作量最多，接口测试次之，UI测试投入最少。

UI测试
​UI测试是最接近软件真实用户使用行为的测试类型。通常是模拟真实用户使用软件的行为，即模拟用户在软件界面上的各种操作，并验证这些操作对应的结果是否正确。
接口测试（API测试）
​API测试，主要针对的是各模块暴露的接口，通常采用灰盒测试方法。首先以黑盒方式设计如何调用API的测试用例，同时在测试执行过程中统计代码覆盖率，然后根据代码覆盖率情况来补充更多、更有针对性的测试用例。
单元测试
​单元测试，属于白盒测试的范畴，通常由开发工程师自己完成，越早发现缺陷其修复成本越低。
为什么要做 UI 自动化？
​随着不停的版本迭代，软件新增功能变的越来越多，对测试资源的需求也变得越来越大，执行人工测试的时间越来越长。对于人工测试的依赖开始变得棘手，因此大家开始寻找解决方案，UI 自动化也应运而生。
人工测试存在以下的弊端：
人工回归测试需要花费很长时间才能完成，很小的延迟就会让发布面临风险…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上期《言简意赅 Android 架构设计与挑选》侧重介绍 “表现层” 框架演化历程及选型依据，
而本人对官方架构示例 “ViewModel + LiveData 部分” 一向存疑，
故这期我们一起来关注 “领域层” 设计，拆解官方设计误区，并给出改善建议，相信阅读后你会豁然开朗。
官方示例一宗罪之 “违背原则之原则”
据 wiki 百科介绍，“最佳实践” 乃管理学概念，意即 “认为存在某种技术、方法、过程、活动或机制可使生产或管理实践的结果达到最优，并减少出错的可能性”，
故易知，架构模式即 “软件工程” 领域 “最佳实践”。
软件工程最佳实践有其原则，即 “设计模式 6 大原则”。然如说哪个原则是 6 原则之首、宁违背其他原则，亦不可违背此原则 —— 此即 “单一职责原则”。
单一职责原则与 “本质” 直接挂钩，架构模式设计如违背单一职责原则，是后续所有弊病祸根所在。如这么说无体会，那就继续往下，一睹为快~
官方示例二宗罪之 “ViewModel 职责混杂”
Jetpack ViewModel 本质有二，
一是页面状态容器，使页面旋屏重建后可直接从 ViewModel 拿取数据，免去传统 onSaveInstanceState、onRestoreInstanceState 之苦，
二是生命周期作用域可设定之容器，例如作用域设定为 Activity 级，则 Activity 旗下 Fragments 皆可共享 Activity 级 ViewModel 之公共数据。
由此易得，该框架违背单一职责原则。
但其实，这俩功能都有存在意义。那怎办，此时最佳实践即，通过创建子类，继续划分职责，直至各司其职即可，
例如可将 ViewModel 划分为 State-Holder 和 Event-Handler，
前者专职托管页面状态数据，是表现层组件，可作为静态内部类声明于 Activit…]]></summary>

🏀什么是Navigation？官方文档的话有点不容易让人理解。所以，这里用我自己的话来总结一下，我们在处理Fragment是需要通过写Fragment的事务去操作Fragment的，而Navigation的出现是为了解决我们之前开发的一些痛点。Navigation主要用于实现Fragment代替Activity的页面导航功能，让Fragment能够轻松的实现跳转与传递参数，我们可以通过使用Navigation，让Fragment代替android项目中绝大多数的Activity。但需要注意的是在使用Navigation切换页面生命周期的变化情况，避免开发过程中踩坑。
🌟官方文档：https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation
🌟navigation项目地址：https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-navigation
💡本文Demo地址：https://github.com/taxze6/Jetpack_learn/tree/main/Jetpack_basic_learn/navigation
使用Navigation具有什么优势？
处理Fragment事务
默认情况下，能正确处理往返操作
为动画和转换提供标准化资源
实现和处理深层链接
包括导航界面模式，例如抽屉式导航栏和底部导航，我们只需要完成少量的代码编写
Safe Args - 可在目标之间导航和传递数据时提供类型安全的Gradle插件
ViewModel支持 - 您可以将ViewModel的范围限定为导航图，以在图标的目标之间共享与界面相关的数据
如何使用Navigation呢？
Navigation目前仅AndroidStudio 3.2以上版本支持，如果您…]]></summary>

前言
一年一年过的太快了，还记得两年前写了 Android 11(R) 的适配文章，这一转眼都13(T)了，这样算下去几年后26个字母就用完了，到时候也不知道 Google 会如何进行命名😂。
下面咱们来看看 Android 13 都有哪些更新，并来看看开发者应该如何进行适配吧！
隐私及权限相关
通知的运行时权限
在之前版本中我们应用如果需要弹通知的话只需要通过 NotificationManager 即可直接进行弹出，不需要任何权限，之前我一直觉得 Google 官方这一点做的不好，通知这么重要竟然不需要用户同意就可以直接弹出，当然你可以在设置中进行手动关闭，但这对于大多数人来说比较困难。然后在 Android 13（T-33）中终于引入了新的运行时权限——通知权限：POST_NOTIFICATIONS。
但是如果用户拒绝通知权限，他们仍会在前台服务 (FGS) 任务管理器中看到与这些前台服务相关的通知，但不会在抽屉式通知栏中看到这些通知。
这个更改对许多应用都有关系，只要你的应用会弹通知，那么如果要适配 Android 13 的话就都需要进行适配，当然适配方法很简单，再按照别的运行时权限适配下新的通知权限即可。
检查应用能否发送通知
如果想要确认用户是否已启用通知，可以调用 NotificationManager.areNotificationsEnabled() 来进行判断。
附近 Wi-Fi 设备的新运行时权限
在以前的 Android 版本中，需要 ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION 权限，应用才能完成与热点相关的多个常见 Wi-Fi 用例、Wi-Fi 直连、Wi-Fi RTT 等。
由于用户很难将位置信息权限与 Wi-Fi 功能相关联，因此 Android 13（T-33）在 NEARBY_DEVICES 权限组中引入了…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天去参加了飞书在深圳的城市大会，现场聆听谢欣讲了飞书的整体逻辑，组织管理的关键点是文化、制度、工具，前两者都很难改变，只有工具才是最佳切入点。回想起少数派折腾工具，建立团队协作的过程，有一些值得分享的幕后故事。

作为一群研究并推荐工具的年轻人，自然也要真正用上这些「先进」工具，所以我们很早就开始启用 Slack 和 Quip 这些海外工具应用。应该说，海外工具的开放性和创新性，确实给团队协作带来了很多有趣的玩法，穿梭于个各个工具之间，用机器人建立各种自动化流程，避免了很多重复劳动，我们也很快开始为这些工具付费了。
后来，团队成员慢慢变多，每个新人都要注册一堆海外工具账号，学习成本不断增加，数据风险也开始不可控。我们也不断尝试国内的协作工具，定位和文化的各种原因，确实没法满足团队的需求。

同一时间段，上万人规模的字节跳动，也在经历这个过程，各种折腾之后，他们决定开发自己的团队协作工具——飞书。
少数派接触飞书其实非常早期。我们一直用媒体资源扶持中小开发者，其中有一个日程工具产品被字节收购，创始人并入了飞书项目组。他作为少数派的资深读者，一直推荐我们关注飞书产品，并且敢打保票，包你满意。

我当时就质问他：你们大公司做项目，经常是壮士断腕，万一市场反馈不好，说停就停了，我们整个团队也跟着白折腾了。
他说：你放心，字节几万人都靠这套工具运作，每年节省下来的人效成本，都足够养活整个工程部门了，放心大胆用吧。

于是，我们就成了飞书最早期的小客户，虽然那时的产品还有很多小 Bug，但确实保持了其他平台欠缺的开放性和创新性，团队成员直接从海外工具平移过渡，用的顺手，很快就升级付费了。
我们自己用好之后，还推荐给内容同行们试试，包括小特社区、影视飓风、先看评测等团队都开始尝试和采买飞书，整体反馈也相当不错。
紧接着，2020 年疫情爆发，大家纷纷开启了远程办公模式，飞书为了帮扶更多中小企业转型线上，下放了整个 Office 的协作功能，开启了阶段性的免费模式，这也带来了很多效率工具的个人用户。

借着这个机会，我们也开始琢磨飞书产品的外部生产力价值。于是，我们将几百人的作者社群，从微信搬到了飞书，用即时通讯模块讨论选题，用飞书文档来约稿创作，用飞书表格来进行内容排期，最后我们还开发了「少数派助手」企业应用，帮助作者把飞书文档上的成稿，一键同步到少数派，并直接发布。飞书不仅解决了内部协作需求，也变成了少数派整个内容创作流程的生产力工具。

转眼两年过去了，飞书从 Office 工具切入，不仅提供了完善的在线文档、多维表格等功能。现在已经开始提供基于人员管理的 People 服务；基于产品研发的飞书项目；基于行政财务的财税综合服务。企业协作体系更加健全了，也开始制定了新的收费策略，价格虽然已经是当年的好几倍，但我们还是选择了付费。
另一个特别有趣的现象是，我们发现身边有大量的生产制造企业也开始使用飞书，包括安克、飞傲、渴创等等，少数派很多品牌客户、联名合作商，都把微信沟通群迁移到飞书上，用文档讨论项目，用表格处理货品，用飞书开会，大家的效率都得到了提升。
如今，飞书已经开始服务理想汽车、元气森林、华润等各个领域的中大型企业了，我们却还是一个几十人的小公司，没能跟上时代的大潮，倍感惭愧。但我们在飞书上有数百人的作者群，还有数千人的会员群，他们都是来自各行各业的精英，都在跟少数派一起体验着飞书的产品魅力，这也算是给未来的「先进企业」埋下火种了。
当然，工具再好，效率再高，也不要了忘了我们追求效率的最终目的，不是攀比谁更狠，谁更卷，而是要把节省出来的时间，更多的放在兴趣爱好和品质生活上，人生不能只活在科技和效率之中，还有广袤的田野和动人的音乐呢。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每个人都有自己的一个工作流，或者说自己的工作习惯。我也有自己的一套工作流程，不过这个工作流一定只会是一个历史产物，我们永远要与时俱进。《随机漫步的傻瓜》这本书里面提到索罗斯，专门说到他这类股市大鳄完全不受过去的行为束缚，摆脱了路径依赖，每一天对他来说都是一张白纸。工作流这事可以借鉴，当你低效工作的时候，可能却感觉一切恰到好处，那你很可能有了路径依赖。
我的工作流，其实完全是围绕分心这件事做的努力。静气，定力，专注，这些听上去像是一个人的个人品质或者能力，真的是一件不可训练的事情吗？我们在信息裹挟的年代，一定要在信息的洪流中随波逐流吗？未必。
知己知彼，百战不殆。我先根据我相对狭隘的研发工作场景来聊聊造成分心的来源。
首先肯定是和信息相关，社交信息，新闻资讯，生活琐事。这些碎片化的内容，随时在挑战我们的专注力。凭自己的意志力，真的就很难去和大数据和人工智能搏斗。
其次就是研发工作本身，虽然交流和沟通不算特别频繁密集，但是工作过程中涉及到的材料是多方面的。包括Gitlab，Tapd，CoDesign等等。我们经常在切换窗口和切换桌面中迷失，或者突然会发现忘记自己要找的是什么文件。这种因为频繁切换上下文导致的分心，不是像你关闭手机通知这样简单粗暴就能处理，更是棘手的一大问题。
最后是一个过载问题。比较简单，一个是需求加塞，一个是多项目穿插，一个是非常短的时间需要交付。我总结的比较简单，但是让一个人大脑过载的场景真的会让人在焦虑中分心和低效。就像电脑内存不够用一样，换电脑是一个选择，对程序的性能优化可能是一个更高技术活的高性价比（当然可能未必高）之选。人脑做不到，你要求它随便扩容，那处理过载问题导致的分心，肯定是绕不过的一个问题。
工作流核心
既然已经抽丝剥茧了，那我接下了说说我的解决方案，终于谈到工作流的内核了。
信息批量处理
应对碎片信息和通知，我的方法很简单，应该大家都用过。…]]></summary>

痛点
总有小伙伴留言或私信问我：

王老师，我没有基础，想要入门数据科学的话，上某某辅导班（收费 XXXX 元），靠谱不？

这问题，还真是不好回答。因为那样的辅导班，我没上过，着实不知道质量如何，不敢妄下判断。
想跨专业系统学习数据科学知识，除了辅导班会让你挑花眼以外，书籍、资料和网上的学习资源也不好挑选。因为数据科学知识技能的特色是发展迅速。一年多以前别人使用某个方法、模型做出的结果，还能发在高水平期刊上。今天你使用同样的方法，却可能会被无情拒稿。这不完全是你的错，只是在这么短的时间里更好的模型已经出现了。你学到的内容嘛，很不幸，落伍了。
那你的下一个问题应该是：

有没有足够省钱，还能随时更新保持追上前沿的学习资料？

这听着很贪心。真有人告诉这样的好事儿，你也会怀疑他是不是个骗子。但实话实说，这样的免费学习资料还真的有，而且一直被很多初学者忽视掉了。因为它并不存在于某个知名的 MOOC 平台上，而是寄身于一个数据科学竞赛网站的角落里。
人们的刻板印象会认为，只有知识技能掌握足够好才会去参加竞赛，因此并不期待竞赛网站会负责详细介绍基础入门知识。这可能让很多人与它失之交臂。
这个竞赛网站，叫做 Kaggle 。这套课程，叫做 Kaggle Courses 。
发现
我最初发现 Kaggle 的这一套自制课程，是在 2018 年 4 月份。之所以还能知道具体的时间，是因为我当时做了笔记。

你看，随手及时记录笔记，很重要吧？
当时 Kaggle 自制课程的名称，还叫做 "Kaggle Learn" 。初始课程的门数很少，只有 6 门。

但是早在 2018 年，我就觉得 Kaggle 这个课程很有特色，所以才专门记录了笔记。什么特色呢？至少包括以下两点：

As I was sitting in a meeting room, speaking with one of my teammates, our manager walked in with the rest of the dev team. The door slammed shut and our manager revealed that he had a big announcement. What unfolded before our eyes was the next project we were going to develop—an open source CLI (command line interface) application.
In this article, I'd like to share what I learned during our development process, and specifically what I wish I had known before we began developing Datree's CLI. Perhaps the next person can use these tips to create a great CLI application faster.

背景：
在 debug 环境中主线程中方法体执行的时间与指定的时间做对比后的堆栈信息，针对性的优化超过指定时间的耗时方法体，减少 ANR 的发生
此工具类主要是通过向主线程Looper打印超过指定时间的耗时堆栈信息以及耗时时长，其中校验时间自已定义，主动查看主线程中的耗时操作，防患未然。
原理：
此工具类为最简单最直接处理、优化耗时操作的工具
大家都知道Android 对于ANR的判断标准:
最简单的一句话就是：ANR——应用无响应，Activity是5秒，BroadCastReceiver是10秒，Service是20秒
然后此工具类的方案就是将主线程的堆栈信息作时间对比监控，超时的打印出来
Looper.loop 解析：
应用之所以未退出，就是运行在loop 中，如果有阻塞loop 的操作就会发生ANR、崩溃
public static void loop() {
    final Looper me = myLooper();
    //....
    for (;;) {
        if (!loopOnce(me, ident, thresholdOverride)) {
            return;
        }
    }
}

主要看死循环
loopOnce
private static boolean loopOnce(final Looper me,
        final long ident, final int thresholdOverride) {
    Message msg = me.mQueue.next(); // might block
    if (msg == null) {
        // No message indicates that the message queue is quitting.
        return false;
    }

    // This must be in a local variable, in case a UI event sets the logger
    // *当有任务的时候打印Dispatching to *
    final Printer logging = me.mLogging;
    if (logging != null) {
        logging.println(">>>>> Dispatching to " + msg.target + " "
                + msg.callback + ": " + msg.what);
    }
    //.... 中间部分未任务执行的代码
    
    //执行结束之后打印 Finished to 
    if (logging != null) {
        logging.println("
上述注释之间的耗时就是主线程在执行某个任务时的耗时，我们只要拿这个时间和指定时间相比就能监控主线程的耗时堆栈信息了
使用方式：
Application:
 //主线程中方法体执行的时间与指定的时间做对比后的堆栈信息，针对性的优化超过指定时间的耗时方法体，
MainThreadDoctor.init(500)

查看日志：

日志等级为明显起见使用error级别
工具类：

前言
继续前面的内容，本文主要记录基于Flame实现飞机大战的敌机创建及生成器的基本内容。
笔者将这一系列文章收录到以下专栏，欢迎有兴趣的同学阅读：
基于Flutter&Flame 的飞机大战开发笔记
敌机构建
创建类Enemy1继承SpriteAnimationComponent，和之前的Player类一样，只是这个是代表敌机的Component。
class Enemy1 extends SpriteAnimationComponent {
  Enemy1({required Vector2 initPosition, required Vector2 size})
      : super(position: initPosition, size: size);

  @override
  Future onLoad() async {
    List sprites = [];
    sprites.add(await Sprite.load('enemy/enemy1.png'));
    final spriteAnimation = SpriteAnimation.spriteList(sprites, stepTime: 0.15, loop: false);
    animation = spriteAnimation;

    add(RectangleHitbox()..debugMode = true);
  }

ps：这里继续使用SpriteAnimationComponent，只不过只有一帧。
最后我们在Game层的onLoad添加一个敌机Component，先假定敌机的位置在(50,50)，大小为50 * 50。当然这里还有前文的Player。

背景&笔者碎碎谈
最近Compose也慢慢火起来了，作为google力推的ui框架，我们也要用起来才能进步呀！在最新一期的评测中LazyRow等LazyXXX列表组件已经慢慢逼近RecyclerView的性能了！但是还是有很多同学顾虑呀！没关系，我们就算用原有的view开发体系，也可以快速迁移到compose，这个利器就是ComposeView了，那么我们在RecyclerView的基础上，集成Compose用起来！这样我们有RecyclerView的性能又有Compose的好处不是嘛！相信很多人都有跟我一样的想法，但是这两者结合起来可是有隐藏的性能开销！（本次使用compose版本为1.1.1）
在原有view体系接入Compose
在纯compose项目中，我们都会用setContent代替原有view体系的setContentView，比如
setContent {
    ComposeTestTheme {
        // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
        Surface(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), color = MaterialTheme.colors.background) {
            Greeting("Android")
            Hello()
        }
    }
}

那么setContent到底做了什么事情呢？我们看下源码

    parent: CompositionContext? = null,

话不多说，直接开始，首先是画出这条曲线，找到每个小时温度对应点位，连成一条线，左边显示最高温度和最低温度，最高温度对应曲线中的最高点，最低温度对应曲线中的最低点，直接上代码
private Point calculateTempPoint(int left, int right, int temp) {
    double minHeight = tempBaseTop;
    double maxHeight = tempBaseBottom;
    double tempY = maxHeight - (temp - minTemp) * 1.0 / (maxTemp - minTemp) * (maxHeight - minHeight);
    Point point = new Point((left + right) / 2, (int) tempY);

}

传入点的左边距，右边距和这个时间段对应的温度，返回一个Point类，Point类中有x，y两个属性，构造方法如下
public Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

tempBaseTop和tempBaseBottom是在初始化中按高度比例来分
tempBaseTop = (mHeight - bottomTextHeight) / 3;
tempBaseBottom = (mHeight - bottomTextHeight) * 3 / 4;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一直以来都有一个做自己产品的梦想，在移动互联网初期的阶段，印象中还是在2012年，我在第二家任职公司主导做过一款产品上线，可惜当时年轻气盛没放在心上，我就去苦心钻研设计了。
这10年里我一直在设计行业深耕，期间也与朋友做过一些产品，也有一些小的成果，由于种种原因最后产品被迫下架了，所以做产品这件事儿，其实陪伴了我的整个从业阶段。
一直以来我认为音乐除了本身的声音以外，还应该传递更多的情绪。【Dtd Playlist】的出现，其实是我在疫情期间居家时，萌生出的一个念头，我想着是不是可以做一款放在桌面上“看着”的歌单产品？有了这个念头后，我就停不下来了，开始着手设计产品、原型、做UI以及相关的准备。
现在你看到的这篇文章是我在验收完合伙人的代码、提了无数bug后，觉得需要记录一下整个过程。毕竟这是我的第一款产品，我要好好对它。
产品名字是【Dtd Playlist】，看名字大家应该能猜得到是一款歌单App。
💥  主打功能：
🔳  精选10种常用场景音乐（学习场景、运动场景、摸鱼放空、深夜emo…），并且实时更新，源源不断
🔳  超酷的GIF播放背景，还有有趣的数字时钟
🔳  真空式播放，没有那些乱七八糟的，只有音乐
🔳  不同风格的版式设计，放在桌面享受与众不同

因为我自己是个资深的Apple Music和Spotify的用户，也是多年的歌单忠实爱好者，所以在筹备阶段，做的第一件事情就是思考我需要放哪些音乐进去？以及如何放？
于是我找了非常多的资料，最后选定以【情绪、场景】来做整体的歌单分类，音乐接入Apple Music和Spotify，由于时间原因，第一个版本只支持Apple Music。
歌单分类页面
 
/late night🌛
最终我精选了10个基于场景的播放列表，并制定了整体的获取机制，让产品随时更新和随机播放。
另外在设计产品的过程中，我一直把设计图放在手机支架上，但我总会去偷看时间，所以在歌单的基础上，我希望用户侧目就可以看到正在播放的音乐以及现在的时间。
所以最终的产品大概就是你们看到的这样：
一个有点不一样、传递情绪的场景GIF + 一个有点意思的数字时钟。
播放页面场景类别不同的播放版式
想想还有哪几个隐蔽的点没有说...

双击喜欢：双击喜欢歌曲后，会同步到Apple Music的喜欢列表，后续你可以在Apple Music听到更多同类型的音乐
切换分类：第一版本还是希望产品更加简单一些，所以分类做的比较隐蔽，点击左上角可以展开

后续看看用户反馈再做一些更新迭代，我自己也有一些迭代计划，大概是以下几点：

接入Spotify
歌单持续迭代的逻辑
“喜欢的歌曲”列表
持续更新更多版式
音乐小组件

【Dtd Playlist 】目前已正式上线，欢迎你在 App Store 下载体验。
最后，希望【Dtd Playlist】能让你放在桌面享受与众不同的音乐，也欢迎大家评论区随时给我们提出意见及建议。
接下来我也会着手进行第二款产品的设计以及开发工作，后续会持续在这里与大家同步。

引言
Fragment 诞生之初就被定义为一个小型 Activity，因此它代理了 Activity 的许多能力（例如 startActivityForResult 等），职责不够单一。随着 Jetpack 各种新组件的出现，Fragment 的很多职责被有效地进行了分担，其本身也可以更更好地聚焦在对 UI 的划分而管理上面，以前的一些 API 也可以退出历史舞台了。本文就盘点一下 Fragment 那些被废弃的 API。
本文的介绍基于 Fragment 版本 1.4.0
1. instantiate

以前， Fragment 的构造函数不允许携带参数，因为某些场景中 Fragment 会由系统自动创建，例如基于 XML 创建 Fragment、Activity 被杀死后的恢复重建等等。此时，系统通过调用 instantiate 来创建 Fragment，instantiate 通过反射调用 Fragment 无参的构造函数。
现在 Fragment 的构造函数允许携带参数了，我们可以通过自定义 FragmentFactory，调用 Fragment 的任意构造函数，而系统通过调用 FragmentFactory 来创建 Fragment。
我们可以自定义 FragmentFactory，并重写它的 instantiate 方法来创建 Fragment：
class MyFragmentFactory(private val arg: Any) : FragmentFactory() {

    override fun instantiate(classLoader: ClassLoader, className: String): Fragment {

智能汽车是集环境感知、规划决策、多等级辅助驾驶等功能于一体的智能网联综合系统，它集中运用了计算机、现代传感、信息融合、通讯、人工智能及自动控制等技术，是典型的高新技术综合体。简单的说，智能汽车的出现将逐步放松车、手、眼，让开车，用车变得简单。这样的产品对有本儿不敢上路的人来说或许是大大的福音。
在北方冬天有点冷，这个时候，去车里，温度很低，给人一种不舒服的感觉，那么有没有一种可能，就是可以通过手机App，实现对车内的一些情况的监测，答案是有的，今天做的这个App，就是这样一个App。
我要实现的功能主要有
用户可以解锁任何车门，
检查电池状态，
控制空调温度，
检查轮胎的气压。
在开始之前大家可以先预览一下我完成之后的效果。如下图所示：

If you find navigating your Git repositories frustratingly complex, have I got the tool for you. Meet Tig.
Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for Git that allows you to browse changes in a Git repository. It also acts as a pager for the output of various Git commands. I use this tool to give me a good idea of what’s been changed in which commit by whom, the latest commit merged, and so much more. Try it for yourself, starting with this brief tutorial.
Installing Tig
On Linux, you can install Tig using your package manager. For instance, on Fedora and Mageia:
$ sudo dnf install tig
On Debian, Linux Mint, Elementary, Pop_OS, and other Debian-based …]]></summary>

前言
最近在学习基于Flutter的游戏引擎Flame，并尝试自己编写一个飞机大战。本文将记录工程搭建和玩家战机创建的过程。强烈推荐在阅读文章前，优先食用以下内容，这将会对你有一定的Flame知识基础。当然，Flutter的基础也是必要的。
Flutter&Flame 游戏专栏 - 张风捷特烈的专栏
flame-engine/flame: A Flutter based game engine
环境及资源搭建
新建项目后，在pubspec.yaml中添加Flame的核心依赖。ps：这里笔者使用的是当前最新的1.2.0版本。
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.17.5 
还有就是常规的Flutter静态资源配置了。ps：这些资源不全是在本文中使用，图片资源都是在网上找到的，是微信飞机大战的资源仅为学习所用。

创建战机
游戏环境
void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(game: Game()));
}

class Game extends FlameGame with HasDraggables {
  @override
  Future onLoad() async {}
}

在Flutter的main函数中，runApp传入一个GameWidget，实际是一个StatefulWidget。Game继承自FlameGame，它是Flame定义的一个Component。Flame依赖于Component进行展开，类比于Flutter依赖于Widget。后续在游戏里的对象都会是在FlameGame对象中添加Component实现。

去年的这个时候，我正提交了英国摄影专业的艺术学校申请，在家热火朝天地准备语言考试。得益于去年整体的新冠疫情较为平稳，我最终得以顺利出国，前往位于伦敦的皇家艺术学院（Royal College of Art）就读为期两年的摄影硕士（Photography MA）项目。
关于摄影硕士有什么好读的这个问题，我想这个问题背后的逻辑大概是这样的：在某种程度上，艺术家或者摄影师其实本身并不是特别需要学历去完成职业发展的几个种类——著名的画家们似乎并不是每一个人都有大学学历。
与之相比，更需要学历的职业好像是律师、医生、公务员等。
然而，在今天的现代社会，想成为靠某一项艺术手段谋生的人，我们能想到的最好的方法似乎是去读一所艺术大学。
来了英国以后，我找到了有几个理由似乎可以解释为什么在今天发达的互联网环境下——我们可以在互联网上学习到一切我们想要学习的技术——我们依然需要学校。
学校教什么？
首先我们不得不承认的是，在互联网上看到的大多作品，是基于算法的赋权机制出现在你面前的。所谓「算法」的基本规则就是：你的软件认为你可能对这样的内容感兴趣。而算法的规则很可能是由一些和我们想要获得的信息不相关的原因，诸如：之前有看过的相似内容；其他与你「相似」的用户喜欢这个内容；这个内容花了钱让它推广等等。
换句话说，我们在互联网上获得有效信息的过程时常是差强人意的。在这个过程中，冗余、重复、无聊的信息往往会在信息流中占据大多数，我们可能要花费比预期多很多的时间才能获得那些真正对我们来说有用的信息。而大学则扮演了一个帮助我们高效率获取有用且前沿的信息机…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[矿卡最近大量出货外加价格跳水，没独显用的DIY电脑玩家也蠢蠢欲动，有些胆子大的群友们已经安全下车。

 
为了给有想法下山的朋友避坑，本文和大家总结分享一下矿卡相关基础知识及简单翻新操作，觉得有用欢迎关注、点赞、收藏三连哈。

 
⏹ 本文目录
本人不卖矿卡，由于矿卡的特殊性也不会给大家推荐店铺，别问我在哪儿买，谢谢理解。

 
⏹ 购买前丨必须了解这些再下手
先回答下大家比较关心的问题，请看完这段再决定买不买。
1️⃣ 矿卡到底能不能上？
如果手头比较紧，上矿卡肯定是性价比比较高的选择，毕竟刚开始批量出货的到手品质肯定比较好，等大货出的差不多了残次品占比也会高点，参考当年的星际蜗牛。

 
当然，买矿卡就是买闷包，到手到底咋样谁说了都不算（包括个人矿），点亮肯定能点亮，不过满载之后的稳定性就不好说了，撞温度墙降频基本跑不掉，比如我自己收的3060 12G就这毛病。

 
一般来说拆机清灰换个硅脂能解决上面说的温度问题，但是也有可能是烧过显存或者GPU核心的返修卡，所以说建议脸黑的朋友就不要考虑上车矿卡。

 
2️⃣ 需要准备多少预算？
矿卡出货目前主要有四个梯队，价格差距不看卡的状态，只看是不是一二线品牌：

300~400元价位的A卡RX580 8g
800~900元价位的N卡GTX1660s 6G和GTX1080 10G
1600-2000元价位的N卡GTX3060 12G/GTX3060ti 8G和A卡6700XT 12G
2000~2200元的N卡GTX3070 8G

 
另外还有最近和都市怪谈一样的BYD代工EVGA 3070/3070Ti，某鱼到处都是求收购，没见过有谁真拿到手，BYD官网也出来辟谣了，感觉JS炒货可能大一些。

 
3️⃣ 去哪儿买比较靠谱？
只能某鱼或者某转了，确实也有低于常规价格10-15%的低价卡，一般是走大货10张起拿，个人用户不…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[View的绘制过程主要都包含在ViewRootImpl#performTraversal方法内，这个方法内主要包括了measure、layout、draw这三个步骤，具体就不放在这里讲述了。我们主要关注下，每次绘制时Framework内是怎么发起到调用的。
1. requestLayout请求绘制
app侧不论是调用requestLayout或是调用invalidate方法来触发重绘，最终都会调用schedueTraversal方法，开始绘制流程，只不过是在该流程中决定是否执行measure、layout或者draw。
ViewRootImpl.java
public void requestLayout() {
    if (!mHandlingLayoutInLayoutRequest) {
        checkThread();
        mLayoutRequested = true;
        scheduleTraversals();
    }
}


void invalidate() {
    mDirty.set(0, 0, mWidth, mHeight);
    if (!mWillDrawSoon) {
        scheduleTraversals();
    }
}

我们重点看下scheduleTraversals方法做了哪些工作
void scheduleTraversals() {
    //mTraversalScheduled字段保证同时间内的多次修改只会执行一次渲染过程（如更新text时）
    if (!mTraversalScheduled) {
        mTraversalScheduled = true;

The most basic way to look at your files and folders is to use the commands ls and ll. But sometimes, I want to see not just the file metadata but also the contents of a file at a glance. For that, I use ranger.
If you love working out of your console and using Vim or Vi, and you don’t want to leave your terminal for any reason, ranger is your new best friend. Ranger is a minimal file manager that allows you not only to navigate through the files but also to preview them. Ranger comes bundled with rifle, a file executor that can efficiently choose programs that work with a given file type.

Ranger can be installed in Fedora …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[找不到合适的配图，一直以来是我对写作心存畏惧的原因之一。正所谓「一图胜千言」，很多时候写好了的文字，总差一张恰到好处的配图画龙点睛。
另一方面，中文环境下比文字版权状况更糟糕的，可能就是图片版权了。不少新媒体 / 自媒体不能恰当地引用图片并标注来源，其实累积了不小的法律风险1。
所幸少数派的大部分作者专注于软硬件分享，可以或截图、或自拍、或借用官方商业图片（毕竟通常是正面宣传，没有太大的风险），从而规避了上述问题2。
所以今天分享的内容，可能只适用于少数派了吧 : )
什么是 DALL · E？
2021年1月，致力于「用通用人工智能造福全人类」的 OpenAI 公司基于其 GPT-3 模型发布了划时代的 DALL·E，实现了从文本生成图像。
来自 DALL·E 论文的 Figure 3，第一行图片是正对照，第二行图片是由 DALL·E 基于每列标题自动生成的图片，剩余三行奇奇怪怪的图片由其他对比算法生成。
DALL·E 的弱鸡版（mini）去年 4 月公开，完全版（mega）一直拖到今年 5 月，DALL·E 2 都正式发布了3，才趁大家都在排队时偷偷放出。
所以我们在指南中建议如下策略，并在后文提供每个策略的具体步骤：

只是想测试看看效果，可以直接使用 Hugging Face 上的 dalle-mini；
需要程序化频繁调用，可以考虑在 Google Colab 部署一份私有的 mini；
追求更好的生成效果，有条件的同学可以尝试一下 mega。

直接使用 mini 版

访问 dalle-mini 模型在 Hugging Face 上的页面；
在文本输入框填入语句，点击 Run 运行；
等待 20-60s 就能看到结果了，就这么简单！
为了方便对比效果，我们统一使用官方案例「an armchair in the shape of an avocado（牛油果形状…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我高中的时候迷上了看小说。那时候躲在被子里，拿着一个寸照大小的单色屏幕的 MP3 看小说，小小的屏幕上只能装得下几十个字。被子里我的我，看得时而咬牙切齿，时而捂嘴狂笑，时而热泪盈眶。多达200多万字的修仙小说，我能一连看十几天。
在这小小的屏幕上，除了文字啥也没有，但是文字符号的力量就是那么神奇，它能通过视网膜成像在我们的大脑里，我们的大脑能把这些符号转化成信息，然后组成连续的意义和因果关系，从而刺激我们的各种感官，激发各种情绪。
为什么符号具备那么强的魔力？它背后的原理是什么？理解它对我们阅读学习有什么帮助？
如果你能耐心看完，应该能获得不少新启发。
符号的神奇之处
从出生开始，我们一直在与各种符号共存。但是我惊异于它能够将毫无相关的事物与我们的意识产生连接，这样的能力是除开人类以外的其它动物无法做到的。

只有人类能够理解符号与它代表的事物之间并不存在必然联系。人类能够故意用一样东西来代表另外一样东西的过程，就叫象征化过程（symbolic process）。——《语言学的邀请》

如果你被老虎疯狂追赶，这个时候，你向它扔出一坨香喷喷的鲜肉，它也许会停下来。但是如果你向它扔出一箱100万元，那就一点用都没有了。但是对于人而言，一坨肉和一箱100万元的价值可想而知。
百度百科说符号即具有代表意义的标识，但是符号本身没有意义。

当你仔细定睛去观测一个符号，你会发现，它只是屏幕上的一粒粒像素组成的复杂黑色线条，它是纸页上印出的规则的墨水痕迹，它也可能是由人类声带震动而发出的一连串声响，是我们思绪里映射有限事物的横、撇、竖、点、捺（“一”、“丿”、“｜”、“灬”、“㇏”）。当我写完上面这段话后，我突然陷入到了一种发呆的状态，这密密麻麻的文字，如果我不看它，它也什么都不是。
《符号学：原理与推演》里说，意义有一个同样清晰简单的定义：意义就是一个符号可以被另外的符号解释的潜力，解…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文首发于北京大学社会化媒体研究中心。
“无线缰绳”(wireless leash)[1]是什么？“无线缰绳”是一种看似无形实则束缚的状态。第一次看到这个词语，是在邱林川的《信息时代的世界工厂》。他在书中描绘道：21世纪初，珠三角地区工厂的工人们通过手机形成了工作和情感交流的信息网，工厂老板意识到了手机赋权的影响后，开始禁止工人在工作时间使用手机，但这样的效果并不明显。于是，工厂开始主动购买分发手机，并建立了工厂内部集群网。
“手机便于携带，老板命令员工无论何时何地都必须带手机，就可以让员工一直处于掌控之中”，同时，老板还可以针对语音和短信进行内部监控，进而令工人们产生心理恐惧。最终，“以前只能在车间里，在生产线上控制工人，现在则可以有一个针对劳工的无线监控网络体系，每周7天每天24小时不间断地达到控制目的。”[2]
如今，经历了3G、4G到5G的通信网络迭代，以及智能手机不断地推陈出新，“手机”已经不再被在工作中禁止，甚至成为了一种工作的工具，不管是老板还是员工也都已经习惯了“手机不离手”的状态。但那根看不见的“无线缰绳”，始终缠绕在我们的身体乃至精神之上，有时被我们短暂性地遗忘了，有时却明显地牵引和控制着我们。本文聚焦“无线缰绳”探讨它如何影响着我们的工作和生活。
“无线缰绳”提升管理效率
在监控技术出现以前，“无线缰绳“是离线的、断网的、原始的，它倾向于外在的道德或法律规范，或者内在的自我良知。
《礼记·为政》有云：道之以德，齐之以礼，讲究用道德来引导人民，用礼仪来规范人民。从非技术角度讲，这种管理方式同样属于“无线缰绳”，它为社会树立了一套规范，既包括道德的，也包括法律的。而在个人层面，“君子慎其独也”(《礼记·中庸》)也可以看作是一种内在的约束。宗教意义上，“无线缰绳”是无时无刻不再注视着你的神的眼睛。而监控技术背后，也是这样一位凝视者。它仿佛牧羊人，照看着所有的…]]></summary>

前言
Flutter 的画笔类 Paint 提供了很多图形绘制的配置属性，来供我们绘制更丰富多彩的图形。前面几篇我们介绍了 shader 属性来绘制全屏渐变的聊天气泡背景、渐变流动的边框和毛玻璃效果的背景图片，具体可以参考下面几篇文章。

Flutter 实现背景图片毛玻璃效果
本篇我们引入一个 Paint 类新的属性：maskFilter，再结合之前的 shader 和动画，看看能玩出什么花样。
MaskFilter 类简介
MaskFilter 类，顾名思义是遮罩过滤器，也就是在绘制过程中给图像加一层遮罩效果，这个遮罩效果是通过某种变换函数实现的。Flutter 官方文档的说明如下，可以看出其实就是对位图的颜色处理。
A mask filter to apply to shapes as they are painted. A mask filter is a function that takes a bitmap of color pixels, and returns another bitmap of color pixels.
遮罩过滤器应用于要绘制的形状，其实就是一个函数，接收一个彩色像素位图，然后返回另一个彩色像素位图。
在 Flutter 里面，目前只提供了一个 MaskFilter 的命名构造函数方式实例化，就是模糊效果。这个模糊效果和我们的图片模糊有点类似，也是使用高斯模糊，只是多了一个模糊样式参数。定义如下：
const MaskFilter.blur(
  this._style,
  this._sigma,
)…]]></summary>

2016 年机缘巧合开始使用被笑称为 1％ 的 Nokia Lumia ，第一次体验到了蔡司（手机）镜头的锐度和 Lumia 相机的高可玩度。从此走上了 手机 -> 黑卡 -> 微单 -> 单反 -> 手机 的摄影爱好不归路。当我真正意识到我喜欢摄影这件事时，恰恰是我以 Lumia 928 和 iPhone 5s 这两部手机为主，完成了我人生的第一个 365 作品：即连续 365 天每天拍摄一张照片发到朋友圈。由此学习到了基础的拍摄概念，并慢慢找到了自己的拍摄风格。
后期软件上也历经学习电脑端的 PS，LR 和手机端的 Camera 360，泼辣，Vscam。现在使用频率最高，也是最为顺手的则是谷歌出品的修图软件 Snapseed。
拍照一时爽，修图到天亮
在过去的数年间，智能手机摄像头的快速发展，让我这样的普通人可以以较低的门槛来享受捕捉美图的快乐，而无需购买昂贵的单反设备，因此带来了摄影领域的一片欣欣向荣。一键修图等美颜或滤镜类的软件则带来了全民出图的高潮和审美的疲劳。
那我是如何看待拍照这件事的呢？且听我慢慢道来。
