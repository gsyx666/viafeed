        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes when you're running a Lighthouse performance check on your sites, you might come across the issue:
<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute

Luckily, this is a pretty easy thing to fix, whether you're using Next.js, or plain ol' HTML!
It's for accessibility! Screen readers often use a different sound library for each language they support. They can easily switch between those sound libraries, but only when a webpage specifies which language to use.
Typically in your average Next.js website, the deployed page ships only a <html> wrapped site, with no language attribute attached.
If you were writing a plain HTML website (or using some other library that allows you to update the shipped HTML files), it would be a simple matter of adding a lang="en" to your outputted HTML, like so:
<html lang="en">

With Next.js, it's a little bit more involved, but luckily not too difficult!
Inside of your pages/ directory (or wherever you put your page components), make a file called _document.js. This overrides the default document that is shipped with your Next.js site. Don't worry though, we won't break anything!
Inside of that file, add the following:
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en"> {/* Add whichever language you want here */}
      <Head />
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  )
}

Boom, you're done! Make sure you don't delete the Html, Head, Main, and NextScript components, because they are required for your site to be properly rendered. Now, next time you run your performance and accessibility audits, your language settings should be in the clear!]]></summary>

It's not a big secret that building a developer portfolio can greatly increase your chances of getting hired.
Everyone tells you that. But, they don't always tell you what makes a good one.
You see, many portfolios are generic and rather uninspiring. If your portfolio looks just like everyone else's, then how can you expect it to stand out?
Well, it won't stand out.
But don't worry – I've been there. My first portfolio was bland, uninspiring, and had many of the not-to-do's I talk about in this post.
However, I'm an ex-marketer, turned developer, I know how to make something stand out. I've made ad campaigns that have skyrocketed sales and had people talking. I realized I needed to think like a marketer to make my portfolio stand out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 31 years old and I didn't knew this. Everytime I wanted to scrape some data table from a website I had to run a script to do it for me, when in fact it was so easy... like a walk in a park.
Let's have a brief example of what I mean. So how do you go from this...

to this...

... in less than 10 seconds.
All you need is the page you want to get the data from, in my case it's this one, and the  Excel app opened (you can use Google drive as well).
We will use the IMPORTXML function which takes as parameters an url, an xpath_query and a locale. All we need is to pass the url and the xpath_query of the table.
Our single line of code will look like this:
=IMPORTXML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population", "//tr")


So basically we are telling the program to fetch any table row from the page and display it in our sheet. Easy, right?
Remember that you can modify the xpath_query to fetch anything from the page.  For example, if I want to fetch the 22nd row of the table I change the function like this:
=IMPORTXML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population", "//table[1]/tbody/tr[24]")

Isn't it awesome? I bet it is. Hope you've learned something! :)]]></summary>

That’s why we were so excited when Shankar Ramaswamy decided to sit down with Dev Interrupted.
Shankar is a veteran leader in the engineering space, having helped recruit, build and guide developer teams at companies like Amazon, eBay, Paypal and Google - where before leaving he managed a team of 300+ people. 
Now the Head of Engineering at Datastax, Shankar took the time to talk to us about some of the practical lessons he’s learned managing teams of several hundred people, and why something he calls the “intent perception gap” is so tricky for managers to get right. 
We also took the time to talk about Shankar’s views on the future of cloud computing, what healthy conflict looks like at unicorn companies and why you might want to rethink your single-vendor strategy.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



(2:54) Shankar’s career from product management at eBay to eng at PayPal

(5:35) Why Amazon is the only place where junior devs argue about customer experience
(11:52) What is the intent perception gap? 
(19:06) Future of cloud computing

(21:07) Why single vendor strategies are a bad idea
(32:19) Devs have no formal training to handle people problems

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英伟达收购 ARM 交易失败

英伟达在当地时间 2 月 7 日的董事会上决定放弃收购 ARM。此前美国、英国和欧盟监管机构就此交易对全球半导体行业竞争的影响提出严重关切。这笔交易是芯片行业有史以来规模最大的一笔交易，最高曾达 870 亿美元。ARM 的技术是全球大多数移动设备的核心。高通和微软等几家依赖 ARM 芯片设计的大型科技公司曾反对此次收购。软银将获得最高 12.5 亿美元的 交易终止费，它将寻求在年底前对 ARM 进行 IPO。


老王点评：很多国家和 IT 企业并不希望 ARM 被收购，这毕竟这对别人来说都不算什么好事。




英特尔加入 RISC-V 国际

虽然英特尔已经有了基于 RISC-V 的处理器，但看来英特尔短期内不会用 RISC-V 取代 x86_64。英特尔加入了 RISC-V 国际，成为首席成员，这一举措 应该是希望吸引更多的客户加入英特尔代工服务，领先的 RISC-V 芯片设计公司 SiFive 已经是其客户。英特尔还将赞助一个开源软件开发平台，帮助 RISC-V 发展其开源软件。


老王点评：不能消灭就拥抱，这很熟悉，对吧？




谷歌云增加加密挖矿检测能力

这项名为“虚拟机威胁检测”（VMTD）的 新功能 是一个无代理系统，它会持续扫描部署在谷歌云环境中的虚拟机内存，以发现 CPU 或 GPU 使用量增加的蛛丝马迹，尤其是加密运算。该功能默认是禁用的，客户需要自行启用。该功能只对非敏感内存起作用，VMTD 不会检查来自标记为“机密”的节点的内存。


老王点评：这个功能对谷歌云及其客户都是有意义的，我想其它的云服务商也应该有类似举措。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天，紫川动画第九集开播，猪期待已久的帝都流血夜剧情终于出来了。
    帝都流血夜是紫川第一部的高潮，也是三兄弟性格展现、人性冲突的一场剧，三人今后的道路和命运都在这一夜被决定了，可以说是紫川第一部里最重要的戏份了。
    因为故事激烈，猪当年是写得很舒畅的。感谢动画制作团队的用心，将这一幕剧情呈现得很符合猪心意，尤其是将总长参星的狠辣和阴险表现得很到位，将原作里一些遗漏和缺陷的情节也做了弥补，猪很是满意，中午和猪老婆一起美滋滋地看了动画，感觉甚是意得志满。
     但孔圣人是怎么说的？天下唯女人难缠也！不学无术的猪老婆甚是可恶，看完以后居然大发厥辞，说动画很精彩，但原作写得太粗糙简单，破绽太多！
这蠢婆娘专门抬杠，差点把猪给气死。
猪婆娘蠢言论：“这场政变虎头蛇尾，这么简单就被平定了，杨明华是送死来的，他根本就一点胜算都没有，本就不应该发动这场叛乱的！”
猪：错！在杨明华看来，他的优势很大！
政变前，帝都的武装力量本来有三部分：中央军，是帝都最大也是最强的武装力量，足有十万兵马，军团长雷迅，是杨明华的亲信；禁卫军，约一万来人，负责总长府的保卫，是忠于总长的；另外还有负责城内秩序的总监察厅宪兵部队，人数也是数千人，是总监察长萧龙统带。至于其他的治部少治安警察在这里基本只有当观众的份了。
本来，总长紫川参星一直就是靠禁军和监察厅的宪兵，才勉强和掌握中央军的杨明华维持了一个危险的弱势平衡，但政变之前，总监察长萧龙被杨明华拉拢了过去，帝都城内局势陡然失衡，何况杨明华还召来了帝林统带的远东边军呢？在政变前的杨明华看来，自己掌握了帝都城内、城外的三大部队，对付只有万把人的禁军，那简直是飞龙骑脸想输都难，他不动手还等什么？
杨明华最大的错误，是没看破帝林是紫川参星安插的卧底，还让他统带了关键的远东边军进城，这导致了他最终的失败。
猪婆娘：“杨明华兵力本身足够，还画蛇添足叫帝林带兵回来干什么？他让中央军直接攻打总长府不就得了？”
猪：在雷迅统带下，中央军的政治立场是倾向于杨明华一方的，但他们毕竟也是紫川家的军官，要他们主动攻打紫川家的总长府跟禁军厮杀，同时还要背一个弑主的名声，大部分中央军军人是不会愿意的。
因为中央军和禁军的士兵都是大多出身帝都本地人，大家本乡本土，搞不好沾亲带故的，都是亲戚街坊邻居朋友，干这种造反、沾血又坏名声的事，动员起来是很有难度的。剧情里，紫川秀能稳住中央军不参与叛乱，一个很大的原因就是中央军的军官团本来就有置身事外的强烈意愿。
但是远东边军就不同了。边军跟帝都老百姓没交情，下得了狠手。在帝都干杀人放火的事他们是毫无压力的。在杨明华的原计划里，帝林带的远东军回来就是当刀子的，而帝都的中央军是用来压阵和事后收拾残局的，两支兵马互相制衡。没料到事与愿违，帝林这把刀子却是捅向了他自己。
猪婆娘蠢言论：“既然杨明华优势很巨大，他为什么不趁早篡位，要拖那么久？”
猪：杨明华在帝都城内确实占尽优势，但他一直不敢篡位，主要障碍倒不是总长府里的那万把禁卫军，而是另外两个原因。
一是元老院。后面的三杰之乱里我们就看到，一个得不到元老会承认和支持的叛逆者，即使能攻下总长府杀了总长，他的处境也会非常艰难的。作为一个老谋深算的政治家，杨明华不能不考虑到后果。
二是驻守各地的带兵统领，像哥应星、明辉、方劲等人。紫川参星虽然暗弱，但他毕竟还是紫川家明面上的主君，他被弑杀的消息传出去，统领们做出什么反应是难以预估的。所以，杨明华必须要准备好应付他们的暗手以后才能动手。
也正是因为有着元老院和统领们的支持，紫川参星这个弱势总长才能对上强势的杨明华坚持那么多年。紫川参星和杨明华，他们二人之间有点像洪秀全和杨秀清，洪秀全拥有大势和名分，杨秀清则拥有实力上的优势。二人之间的斗争，谁赢都有可能，胜负也只是一线，不能说哪一方是压倒性优势或者毫无机会的。
辨了一个中午，最后，杠精猪老婆哑口无言，猪大获全胜，鼻孔朝天。
总之，对于这一集帝都流血夜，猪是很满意的~~感谢腾讯、铸梦工作室和万维猫动画的兄弟姐妹们，你们出色地复现了原作剧情，表达了猪的想法，让猪当年梦想的世界和故事得以活灵活现地呈现出来，与喜欢的读者们一同分享！

2022 年 2 月 4 日，「新冠疫情爆发后首届如期举办的奥运会」——北京 2022 年冬奥会（大名：「第 24 届冬季奥林匹克运动会」英文「XXIV Olympics Winter Games Beijing 2022」，简称「北京冬奥会」）在「鸟巢」（国家体育场）正式拉开帷幕。春节期间，应该也有不少读者通过电视和网络直播「围观」过开幕式和国家体育场主火炬塔点燃的瞬间。
为了帮助你更好地观看北京冬奥会的比赛，这份包含观赛平台、赛程表等的冬奥观赛补给包特地为你准备好，为你的冬奥观赛助一臂之力。
这届冬奥会到底在哪里举办？
虽说是「北京冬奥会」，但实际上是由北京市联手河北省张家口市，由北京赛区、延庆赛区和张家口赛区共三个赛区共同举办 。北京赛区主管速度滑冰、短道速滑、冰壶、冰球、花样滑冰等冰上项目以及单板和自由式滑雪大跳台等雪上项目；延庆赛区举办高山滑雪、雪橇、雪车和钢架雪车四个分项；张家口赛区则承办冬季两项、越野滑雪等雪上项目。
你知道上面的小图标代表哪些场馆吗？
闭环管理是啥？
由于疫情原因，北京冬奥组委决定对运动员、随队官员和其他利益方人员（包括志愿者、记者等）进行闭环管理。闭环管理就是境外来华的人员，从入境进入海关后开始体温筛查，经过核酸采样，然后直接通过专用的交通工具送到奥运村或签约酒店。每个奥运村和签约酒店，都是一个独立的闭环。从入境到抵离，交通、餐饮、住宿、训练、比赛，包括媒体的采访，形成了多个闭环点，通过交通工具在这些闭环点连线移动进行活动和工作，就是一个完整的闭环。这样做可以有效避免闭环外人员被可能的病例感染。

各位朋友们，新年快乐！在熬过了两个游戏行业的「小月」以后，我们终于将要迎来有硬菜上桌的一个月，玩家社群期待多时的一些作品即将于下旬面世。
本栏目设有有奖互动环节，详情依旧请看文末。
艾尔登法环 / Elden Ring

填空题：（        ）神坛。

推出日期：2022.02.25
登陆平台：PS4、PS5、X1、XS X|S、PC

终于到了要正式介绍这部作品的时候了，一款开放世界 ARPG 游戏，由 FromSoftware 负责开发，「魂」系列游戏制作人宫崎英高、以《冰与火之歌（A Song of Ice and Fire）》等作品闻名的小说家乔治·R·R·马丁（George Raymond Richard Martin）联合创作了游戏世界观，从《只狼：影逝二度（Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice）》时代有传闻开始，就一直受到「魂」类游戏粉丝追捧、引起媒体与玩家社群广泛关注。
和《黑暗之魂（Dark Souls）》等同门的「魂」系列作品类似的是，本作依然是由玩家自创角色游玩，而动作部分的体验不光整体继承了「魂」的风味，还扩充了骑马作战、魔法技能两大方面；而与「魂」大相径庭的是，《艾尔登法环》改弦更张为开放世界式的地图设计，串联各个「迷宫」的不再是一条条线性通路，而是分布着自然景观、聚落、谜题等的旷野，供玩家自由穿行。
最后分享一点纯个人的《艾尔登法环》网络测试玩后感：从观感上讲，本作在「魂」的中世纪剑与魔法风格基础上有所升华，而且执行得挺不错，从初始地洞爬出、第一次亲眼见到…]]></summary>

前言
相信各位身处异乡的同学一定会被父母抱怨过家里的网络或者电脑问题，也时不时打开诸如  FaceTime 或者微信视频之类的软件帮助父母远程解决问题。现在国内网络基建发展迅速，几乎做到了 FTTH（光纤入户），但是很多老房子的配套网络硬件都很古老，新房子开发商也会留下很多暗坑。而各大运营商的宽带服务也只解决到光猫端。所以老家的网络一直是我们这些在外漂泊折腾人的心头大痛。
当然每家每户的情况都很不一样，本文我就以我老家三次网络结构调整的一些经验和问题为主，详细讲讲怎么让家中的老人用上舒心的网络。
正文
我家是一个二〇一〇年代中后期的房子，在交房之初国内还处于百兆宽带普及的阶段，因此家庭的基础网络布线还是不错的——做到了 Cat.5e 线布到每个房间，这为之后铺设良好网络建立的良好的条件。但是开发商仍然留了不少暗坑给我，下面让我们先整理一下最开始的网络拓扑结构。
拓扑梳理
最开始我们先看看我家的的结构图以及弱电箱
家中的户型，以及网口分布图
可以看的出几个主要活动的区域的网口覆盖还是相当到位的，但是弱电箱在走廊中间的储物柜中且只有一点点大，塞满了设备的弱电箱简直惨不忍睹：
开发商留下的弱电箱
让我们梳理一下弱电箱中的各个部分和模块的功能：

GPON 光猫：负责光纤入户以及播号，同时需要供给电话信号。
百兆交换机模块两个：负责全屋网络交换，共计两个 12 根网线。
电话线交换模块：负责电话信号拨入以及分发。
有线电视分配器：负责分配有线电视信号。
电源：负责供给弱电箱中的电能。
数字电视线：负责电视盒子（类似 IPTV）的数字接入，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“帝都流血夜”在原著《紫川》中，是一段非常重要且深刻的剧情，杨明华蛰伏多年，终于在认为自己有把握的时候露出了自己的獠牙。编剧在改编这段的时候和我们讨论了很久，他们建议能把杨明华的整条阴谋计划拉满，因为反派能力越强，才能显示主角们扭转乾坤的不易。[正义总能打倒邪恶.jpg] 
但那样会对原著进行大幅度改编，于是我们进行了反复推演，如果我们自己是杨明华， 手握这样一把好牌，我们应该怎么打？是强行夺权逼宫，不顾世人看法？ 还是会给自己扯一面大旗，把自己包装成正义之师？ 再或者……娶了紫川宁，毕竟没有血缘关系。[滑稽.jpg]
原著中曾经提到“杨明华实在是相貌堂堂——怎么看都象个正直可靠的长者！”但实则““卑鄙到——连把牙刷都不能交他保管！”，足以看出杨明华是一个道貌岸然的人，做事考虑的也会更周全，所以最终我们为他选择了“勤王”的招数：让明羽模仿紫川宁笔迹，再盖上她的私印→让紫川宁昭告天下紫川参星的“罪行”→杨明华带军队前来救驾→事成之后再找机会暗害掉无人保护的紫川宁→紫川家族再无后人，杨明华自然就能上位了。
而对于最大对手哥应星， 杨明华的计划是：派帝林去领远东军，分散哥应星势力→强行让帝林带远东军队回帝都→军官大会上帝林杀掉哥应星→为平公愤，杨明华“大义灭亲”处决"刽子手”帝林。 杨明华算计了很多人，但是唯独忽略了紫川参星，这才酿造了自己的悲剧。[事后烟.jpg]
《紫川》是一部史诗题材作品，里面有很多战争权谋的戏份，为了还原这些，团队进行了很多细致的思考，希望能给到大家一部不一样的动画番剧。

我最近有点迷恋上了一个在线单词猜谜游戏，在这个游戏中，你有六次机会来猜一个随机的五个字母的单词。这个词每天都在变化，而且你每天只能玩一次。每次猜测后，你猜测中的每个字母都会被高亮显示：灰色表示该字母没有出现在神秘单词中，黄色表示该字母出现在单词中，但不在那个位置，绿色表示该字母出现在单词中的那个正确位置。

下面是你如何使用 Linux 命令行来帮助你玩像 Wordle 这样的猜测游戏。我用这个方法来帮助我解决 1 月 6 日的谜题：

第一次尝试

Linux 系统在 /usr/share/dict/words 文件中保存了一个单词词典。这是一个很长的纯文本文件。我的系统的单词文件里有超过 479,800 个条目。该文件既包含纯文本，也包含专有名词（名字、地点等等）。

为了开始我的第一次猜测，我只想得到一个长度正好是五个字母的纯文本词的列表。要做到这一点，我使用这个 grep 命令：

$ grep '^[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]$' /usr/share/dict/words > myguess


grep 命令使用正则表达式来进行搜索。你可以用正则表达式做很多事情，但为了帮助我解决 Wordle 问题，我只需要基本的东西。^ 表示一行的开始，$ 表示一行的结束。在两者之间，我指定了五个 [a-z] 的实例，表示从 a 到 z 的任何小写字母。

我还可以使用 wc 命令来查看我的可能单词列表，“只有” 15,000 个单词：

$ wc -l myguess
15034 myguess


从这个列表中，我随机挑选了一个五个字母的单词：acres。a 被设置为黄色，意味着该字母存在于神秘单词的某处，但不在第一位置。其他字…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是比利白。

上期我们聊了北京冬奥会的单板滑雪项目，今天我们来聊聊自由式滑雪项目，为了单板更好作区分，我更愿意称它为双板自由式滑雪。

不方便看视频的朋友，我也准备了图文内容：
自由式滑雪比赛
同为双板滑雪，自由式滑雪虽然在高山滑雪的基础上孕育发展而成，但进入冬奥会的时间却比高山滑雪项目要晚得多，直到1988年加拿大卡尔加里冬奥会上才作为表演项目出现，当时还有如今已经绝迹的雪上芭蕾项目。

自由式滑雪充满活力和观赏性，运动员通过冲击高难度动作来赢得高分，在空中展示灵活和敏捷性，这个项目中，许多运动员都有体操和蹦床的训练背景，比如05年出生的何金博就在13岁时从武术队跨项进入国家集训队，人称少林小子的他去年底解锁了倒滑Double Cork1800（空翻两周转体1800度），成了中国第一人。
何金博
1992年法国阿尔贝维尔冬奥会，雪上技巧正式被列为比赛项目。

我国在自由式滑雪项目上的冬奥成绩还不错，2006年的都灵冬奥会，韩晓鹏在空中技巧项目上拿下了中国冬奥会历史上获得的第一枚雪上项目金牌，至今中国凭借1金6银4铜共11枚奖牌位列自由式滑雪冬奥历史奖牌数量第四位，仅落后于美国加拿大和法国。
韩晓鹏
本次北京冬奥会，中国自由式滑雪将多点冲金，天才少女谷爱凌将参加自U型场地技巧、坡面障碍技巧和大跳台三个项目。
谷爱凌谷爱凌
而男子，女子和空中技巧混合团体项目上，名将贾宗洋，齐广璞，徐梦桃和孔凡钰也将向金牌发起冲击。
贾宗洋齐广璞徐梦桃孔凡钰
自由式滑雪比赛将于2月3日至19日在云顶滑雪公园和首钢滑雪大跳台两地举行。共设男女空中技巧、雪上技巧、障碍追逐、U型场地技巧、坡面障碍技巧和大跳台以及空中技巧混合团体共13个小项。共产生男、女各6人+1个团体总计13枚金牌。

从比赛规则来区分，除去障碍追逐比拼速度靠计时排名，其余五项均为技巧项目，依靠裁判打分。

写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢 「用产品思维解构生活」 的花生酱，也可以叫我 Jeff。
我至今正式写作了 6 年，看上去是蛮不错的坚持成果，但老实说，最近 1 年我才开始喜欢自己的文章，也是在最近 1 年，我才找到自己「高效产出文章」的效率写作之道。
效率写作是个复杂的旅途，途中险象环生。
缺乏灵感和选题会让我们放弃，自说自话会让我们找不到读者，拾人牙慧会让我们迷失自我。这些复杂的难题，每一个都足够成为效率杀手，吞没我们的写作生涯。我也是花了5年时间，才逐一和解，摸索到我今日能安于写作的状态�。
所以，我试图用这篇文章探讨：谈及写作，我们如何从入门、坚持再到高效。
希望诸君无需 5 年弯路，都能找到自己的效率写作之道。
粗放写作的利与弊
2022 年 1 月我的少数派数据
2016 年的我，从未想过自己能有幸发表文章被几万人阅读。
彼时，我带着不屑与傲慢开始写作，尝试去解答一些诸如「产品经理能力模型」的宏大命题。结果是，我被社区拒稿了 4 次，进而，巨大的恐慌和质疑包围着我。当时被拒绝的原因诸如：

文章结构不符合金字塔思维；
内容不够深度...

但我都不能完全地理解、修正，甚至自己完全看不出问题。
这种不理解，进一步引发了自我怀疑。
每天我都在想，我是不是不适合写作，我写的东西是不是太啰嗦了，或许我当前的能力不足以写产品话题，我该沉淀两年再等等？但对于这些问题，我并没有能力第一时间找到答案---否则就不会被拒绝 4 次了。
总之，我带着诸多疑问和拙劣…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fragments 2.0 的发布使其成为 Linux 发行版中最方便用户使用的 BitTorrent 客户端之一。让我们来看看有什么新变化。




Fragments 是 Linux 上最好的 BitTorrent 客户端之一。

最新的 Fragments 2.0 是一个重大升级，它使用 Rust、GTK 4 和 Libadwaita 从头开始完全重写。

除了技术上的改进之外，你还会发现一些新的功能和改进的用户界面。

让我重点介绍一下它的变化。

Fragments 2.0 的新变化



最近，Gnome 应用程序的生态系统经历了一些大规模的变化。在这个变化的最前沿是向 Gtk4 和 Libadwaita 的过渡。不幸的是，这种变化并不小，许多应用程序需要从头开始重建，以支持这些新标准。

与许多其他应用程序开发者一起，Fragment 的开发者 Felix Häcker 决定从头开始重建 Fragments，现在作为 Fragments 2.0 发布。因此，我们现在得到了一个改进的 Linux 的 BitTorrent 客户端。

其中的一些改进包括。


一个基于 Libadwaita 的漂亮的新用户界面

新的模块化架构

能够被用作远程 Fragments / Transmission 会话的远程控制

新的偏好对话框有更多的选项

能够查看有关网络的统计数据


一个新的用户界面



Fragments 2.0 现在有一个基于 Libadwaita 的新 UI。补充一句，Libadwaita 是 GTK4 对 Gnome 应用程序的一个扩展。它有几个优点，最明显的是在所有 Gnome 应用程序中具有一致的外观。

它比旧的主题更加扁平和圆润，我觉得，看起来非常时尚。

你可以得到一个外观简洁的 BitTo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recentemente tive que implementar uma padronização de breakpoints para deixar responsivo uma aplicação.
Nessa aplicação usando o Material UI, a lib  me traz uma série de valores de breakpoints já definidos, porém a ideia era centralizar esses valores em um único lugar..
1 -Foi criado o  customHook "useSkillsMediaQuery".
Bom, com isso traz uma certa manutenibilidade e padronização bem mais definida e isolada.

Porém  é difícil para debugar e reconhecer  os valores de cada variável..
É ai que vem o useDebugValue..
2 - Com o useDebugValue eu passei um objeto informando o valor de cada variável em especifica e o valor de seu breakpoint, ou seja cada item do objeto possui um objeto e dentro desse objeto retorna 'true' ou 'false' informando se a tela se encaixa no seu valor, além de uma descrição informando a sua largura minima(min-width).

Entendeu, haha?
3 - Bom, inspecionando o componente onde o useSkillsMediaQuery foi chamado e  ao diminuir ou aumentar a tela do navegador,  usando o React DevTools é possivel ver essas informações.

Telegram bots
Telegram, one of the biggest messenger platform, offers a Bot API that allows third-party automation. Users can start chatting with bots and these bots can send
message to users. This opens a wide range of what’s possible on the platform: sending commands to a system, receiving security notifications, or any
other integration.
Since you, the developer, control the bot, you can define how it interacts with your environment. It could start EC2 instances, monitor Kubernetes clusters in
GCP, or send a notification when a backup is completed. Or the tea.
Why build on an existing platform and not start a separate project, probably a website?
With Telegram, you get push notifications, account security with 2-factor authentication (phone number and an …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem:


You have a container under a docker-compose project, that you want to communicate or access another container which exists under a second docker-compose project
For some security policy, your SysOp or hosting provider blocks all external traffic, except those for port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS). However, you want to set up and manage several web (or non-web) services on your machine, basically using docker containers and managed by docker-compose.


To handle this you set-up a reverse-proxy using a dedicated docker-compose project and container, called proxy.


The proxy container/project listens on port 80, for all incoming external requests. (The nginx config can distinguish the called domain with the server_name directive)


On the other side, on another docker-compose…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you know TDD? I mean, do you REALLY know TDD?
I'm asking because even though this is a common acronym in today's tech vocabulary, it's still common to find people testing blindly(or even, not testing at all).
TDD is not a new technique, but today it is a must-have skill in development. For example, many jobs descriptions require this competency. So, if you want to understand TDD, this is the perfect article for you.
TDD is the acronym for Test-Driven Development. That means that you will write your code based on your tests.
Your tests come first.
This way, you can focus on how your code has to work and, most importantly, how it shouldn't work. So doing the tests first helps you think about all the possibilities and avoid overengineering while coding.
Does this seem an impossible task? Y…]]></summary>

This article provides a recipe for building fast look-up tables for huge CSV data sets in Python.
Look-up tables are meant to be read-only data structures used to search for a presence of a given key and to retrieve multiple values associated with existing keys. 
Recipe is meant to be a rough approach in contrast to a precise algorithm. 
Huge is relative and means significantly exceeding the amount of available RAM of a single machine, but comfortably fitting its storage.
Fast is subjective for a given use case and means quick enough to be used in stream processing or row-by-row batch processing.
The goal is achieved by calculating numeric representations of target keys, sorting and indexing the data set, doing binary se…]]></summary>

iPhone as a phone is one with so many updates and changes brought in every time. Before the year 2022 and before the official release of the iPhone13, some leakages on information about iPhone 14 got out of the company.
No Notch and New Face ID Hardware Design








Body Design






As concerned with the design, the iPhone 14 is expected to look like iPhone 13. Some features like volume buttons of round shape and thickness unlike features like the size and quality of the material being made with will be updated.
There will be no 5.4-inch iPhone in 2022 because Apple is doing away with the "mini" line following lacklustre sales. The iPhone 13 mini will be the last of the mini phones and going forward, Apple is expected to focus on larger-sized iPhones.

Rather than have all those links listed out on the side, we wanted the user to be able to expand and collapse them in order to have a cleaner look and feel.
At the top level of our navigation, we have a SideNavigation.vue component that gets the navigation information from a navigation.yml file in our content folder. Each navigation element can have a children property (shown below) that lists out the child routes of that page.

This is the original template we had set up for the component:
<template>
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="nav of navigation"
      :key="nav.to"

Windows and Flutter
Windows support arrives with Flutter 2.10 and in the coming months, you’ll hear more from Flutter on completing stable support for macOS and Linux, making the full set of desktop, web, and mobile platforms available for your production Flutter apps.
Performance improvements
This release of Flutter includes initial support for dirty region management provided by Flutter community member Knopp. He’s enabled partial repaints for a single dirty region on iOS/Metal. This change reduced 90th and 99th percentile rasterization times on a few benchmarks by an order of magnitude, and reduced GPU utilization on these benchma…]]></summary>

Well, I and a couple of friends had in mind to build a bot to stay updated on the prices and upcoming releases of the sneakers. The biggest problem was finding the right API, but we managed to find a guy who did a huge job, put together: StockX FlightClub, Goat, and Stadium Goods API, cool right?
Sneaks-API by @druv5319
First create an application and a bot from here and in auth -> general check bot and Administrator, save the bot token in the bot page.
Invite the bot in your discord server
git clone https://github.com/LucaArgentieri/Shoe-Discord-Bot.git

Run
npm i
Create a .env file and put bot token
BOT_TOKEN_KEY=DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE

Run
npm run start
Use commands in chat! 🎉
This is the list of all commands at this moment. I'm here to show you and take new ideas for upgrading my bot.
$help For information on generic resell prices or based on the desired number.
$retail Yeezy(example) To get information about a shoe at retail.
$nextDrop To stay updated on upcoming releases.
$todayDrop To stay updated on the releases of the day.
$monthDrop To stay updated on the releases of the current month.
$infoShoesNumber Yeezy 11(example) To get information about a shoe with number.
$mostPopular To see the most popular scapre in the last three months.
This is a personal project that I use to learn, everyone is free to use it and can contribute to the code.
I let you the link to my repo and thank you for reading, see you in the next post.
Bye!]]></summary>

The book created a new shared vocabulary and named these repeated solutions we see all over different codebases. So much so there have been multiple other books on design patterns, documenting even more examples. You can quickly explain that your solution is an Adapter for anyone who has read about it without detailing what an Adapter is.
The material, as expected, isn't without critique, Peter Novig wrote his analysis on how many of these patterns are unnecessary or replaceable by simpler constructs in dynamic languages.

In this post, I will be talking about a mistake that even experienced developers make when coding Wordle and how it can be fixed.
The rules of Wordle are straightforward:
Guess the secret word wihin 6 tries.
Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:
GREEN: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
YELLOW: The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
GRAY: The letter is not in the word in any spot.
So why are most hobbyists and even content creators such as Web Dev Simplified and Burke Holland from Visual Studio Code getting it wrong?*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国要替换华为和中兴设备，却没钱没设备

为替换华为和中兴的设备，美国联邦通信委员会的“安全可信通信补偿计划”为拥有 1000 万以下用户的运营商提供补偿，预算为 19 亿美元。然而在三个月的申请期间收到了 56 亿美元的申请，这就需要美国国会重新解决资金问题了。此外，除了 资金问题之外，准备提供替换设备的思科、Juniper 也不能及时提供设备产能，他们表示可能要 1-2 年的时间才能生产出来。


老王点评：如果真的有后门，这么长时间想做什么都做完了吧。




Meta 正考虑退出欧洲市场

伴随着《欧洲通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）的生效，美国的隐私保护法规被认为不符合规定。在欧盟法院的一项重要裁决之后，宣告欧盟-美国之间的有关个人数据的隐私盾协议无效。这一裁决影响到每一家美国公司，包括 Meta、谷歌、微软和亚马逊等。在近日提交的一份 SEC 文件中，Meta 说如果它不能与美国的业务、应用程序和数据中心分享欧洲用户的数据，将对其有针对性的在线广告能力产生破坏性影响，它或将干脆完全 撤出欧洲。


老王点评：或许广告盈利模式会有一些新的变化和博弈，但是我想本质上不会变，用户获得免费服务的代价总是以某种形式支付。




AI 已经威胁到有声书行业的从业者

与 传统的人工配音 相比，AI 配音的有声书成本要低得多。但是将失去工作的不仅仅是配音员，而是整个有声书配音生态。根据美国音频出版商协会的最新数据，美国 2020 年出版的有声书超过 7.1 万本，但只占当年出版的印刷书籍数量的一小部分。专业的配音员认为自己所从事的是艺术，然而这并不能阻止出版商越来越多的采用 AI 来配音。


老王点评：和很多即将被 AI 取代的工作一样，我觉得与其抱怨和反对，倒不如想想如何让 AI 更好的配音，重新定位自己的角色。]]></summary>

If a web app leaks 5 MB on every interaction, but it still works and nobody notices, then does it matter? (Kinda sounds like a “tree in the forest” koan, but bear with me.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[短暂按压没有任何后果，长时间按压（超3秒）的后果看命硬不硬！
汽车工业设计会把用户假设为二傻子的，这个二傻子会做很多匪夷所思的事情。包括但不限于把头伸进正在关闭的车窗中、用手摸摸点烟器有没有电、时速120km/h情况下按下熄火开关、油门刹车同时踩下去等等等。
汽车工业设计的逻辑是通过设计，在源头上避免二傻子这些操作产生不良后果，而不是寄希望于二傻子不去做这些匪夷所思的动作。

电子手刹在设计之初就考虑到了你可能会误操作，因此高速状态下的短暂误触操作会直接被行车电脑忽视。
长时间按下电子手刹按键会触发紧急制动，此时效果等同于我们全力踩刹车，同时ESP也会介入工作，保持车身稳定。
这时候的结果多严重，就要看命硬不硬了。
命硬的后方无车，不会追尾。
被命运安排好轮回的，可能后边就是一辆开了一晚上车的疲劳驾驶的司机驾驶的超载的并且拉了一车钢卷的濒临报废的大卡车。
唯一的好消息是，这个情况下追尾后车负全责。
珍爱生命，请勿高速上触发紧急制动。
汽车上的类似在设计上避免二傻子受伤害的功能还很多：

1、开车门自动挂入P档，防止溜车。
2、行驶中（时速11km/h以上）无法挂入P档、R档。
3、车窗、天窗、后备箱防夹功能。

4、行驶中误触点火开关不熄火。长按也会熄火，此时车辆会进入滑行状态。
5、刹车油门同时踩下去保证车能刹车，直到停下。
6、儿童安全锁，避免婴幼儿误触开车门造成危险。特别注意：行车自动落锁不能取代儿童安全锁使用，行车自动落锁后，车内依然能开门。
7、事故自动拨打求助电话。气囊弹出后，车机自动拨打博世救援平台电话。
8、不踩下刹车，无法挂入前进挡D档位。
9、天窗遇雨自动关闭。
10、车辆行车自动落锁。
11、车辆启动或通电状态下，无法在车外通过钥匙锁车。
12、座椅无论怎么调节，不会顶破风挡玻璃。
这个世界还是很有爱的，感谢工程师。
对了上帝设计人类也是这个逻辑，你无法自己憋气把自己窒息死亡。
（声明：并不是所有的车都具有我所说的上述功能，但是上述功能都是量产车中提供的功能。）

啫喱：元宇宙版「微信」上线？

平台：iOS
关键词：虚拟社交、通讯、虚拟形象

@Snow：如果要盘一盘这两个月最火热的应用，《啫喱》绝对算得上其中之一，乘着「元宇宙」的东风，这款可爱度拉满的虚拟社交应用，吸引了许多人换装入住。
啫喱的启动页妥妥地向「小而美」致敬，站在月球上遥望着已经萌化的地球，在加入这个可爱的元宇宙之前，你需要为自己创造一个虚拟形象，是时候祭出玩 RPG 游戏攒下的传统艺能——捏脸。你可以调整自己的五官、发型，搭配各式各样的服饰，你可以直接调用整套穿搭节省时间，也可以细致地拣选每一件潮流单品，这里所有的装扮都没有性别之分，你可以自由地表达你的审美喜好。

虚拟形象设置完成，是时候开始找些事做了。应用目前提供了 28 种活动项目和情绪表达，你可以在这个元宇宙中随心所欲地躺平，毫无节制地干饭和吨吨吨，或是在马桶上蹲一天，当然你也可以塑造勤奋向上的人设，继续努力搬砖。这个空间也会随着自然时间的流逝，不断地变换色彩，蓬勃的朝晖和浪漫的晚霞，这里也可以看到。
这么自由的空间，一个人独乐乐岂不是有些可惜，把小伙伴们拉进来，一起蹲坑，一起摸鱼，这样才能创造更多乐趣。

虽然啫喱主打的并不是熟人社交，但并没有微信摇一摇那样的功能，你可以通过昵称、手机号、通讯录或是二维码等形式添加好友。添加后，你的好友就会和你共享一个元宇宙，虚拟小人们会开始互动，你们还可以共享个人状态、地理位置和手机电量…]]></summary>

中国文化源远流长，有许多取之不尽、用之不竭的元素和符号，《师父》作为一款以中国风为设计主题、中国城市为故事背景的游戏，我们也加入了许多能够代表中华文化的意象，融入了游戏的玩法和UI设计之中，希望能够创造一种足够有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅！ 
例如在游戏中，玩家可以在关卡场景的一些角落发现一个闪着光的“玉玺”，玩家与其交互之后，就可以进入技能和能力成长系统，花费掉自己积攒的经验值来解锁更强力的招式与战斗技巧。一旦使用过之后，这个玉玺便会不再发光，玩家需要在之后的关卡中继续寻找另一个闪光玉玺，才能继续解锁能力、不断成长——玩家们，在地图之中时，可要瞪大眼睛了。 

例如在游戏中，玩家扮演的主角拥有死而复生的能力（在游戏序章就会展现出来），这样的能力来源于一个家族继承的宝物——我们把它设计成了一个五枚铜钱组成的坠饰。它会时刻挂在主角的腰间（玩家可以轻而易举地注意到，提醒自己余下的生命长度），当死亡次数达到一定的限度时，其中一枚铜钱便会崩裂，当五枚铜钱皆依次崩裂时，玩家将失去复生的能力，最后一次死亡将是永久的告别——玩家们，在酣畅战斗之时，也要注意自己腰间的铜钱所剩几何。 
还有更多中国文化相关的元素和设计潜藏在游戏中的方方面面，或许是墙上的标语、收音机中的新闻、主角武馆中的装潢等等，这些元素浸润在游戏之间，也是我们努力学习并尽力描绘出美丽的中华文化的成果——我们希望《师父》能够是一场令人难忘又热血沸腾的中国功夫之旅！

《师父》已经于2022年2月8日上线Epic商城和PlayStation商城，这是一款以中国功夫：白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的动作冒险游戏，追求拳拳到肉的战斗体验。玩家将扮演一位功夫学徒，不断成长与进步，最终战胜弑亲的凶手们。 
希望你们能够喜欢！

《师父》是一款以中国风作为设计主题、中国城市作为游戏背景、中国功夫白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的游戏。因此为了创造出一场真正具有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅，我们也潜行学习了中国功夫和中华文化，虽然掌握的可能只是九牛一毛，但依然希望能够给玩家带来令人印象深刻的记忆！ 

因此，在游戏《师父》中也有许多有趣的细节或是彩蛋—— 
1.不同于其他的时间循环与Roguelite机制，《师父》采用了一套独特的死亡与成长机制：当你在战斗中死去，你会再次复活，为此你付出的代价就是衰老。每一次死去，都会老去一点。玩家的初始年龄是20岁，经过多次倒下后，年龄最大上限为75岁左右（根据游玩方式来判定最大年龄），一旦超过这个界限，就将永久死亡。 
2.不断死去，不断衰老——玩家在不同的年龄段会有不同的战斗特点，最直观的影响就是：年龄越大，生命值越低、攻击力越强。

3.玩家扮演的功夫学徒腰间有一个五枚铜钱组成的坠饰，它代表了玩家拥有死而复生的能力，它会时刻挂在主角的腰间（玩家可以轻而易举地注意到，提醒自己余下的生命长度），当死亡次数达到一定的限度时，其中一枚铜钱便会崩裂，当五枚铜钱皆依次崩裂时，玩家将失去复生的能力，最后一次死亡将是永久的告别；类似的这些沉浸式UI还有很多，都是为了提醒玩家自己所处的年龄阶段，根据年龄来选择更有利的战斗方式。 
4.《师父》具有极高的重玩性与耐玩度，你在另一个地图关卡中可能会寻找到有关于另一个地图关卡的线索——它或许可以帮助你打开一扇封闭的门，绕过一大群敌人来抄近路，更快地找到关卡BOSS。

5.《师父》的动作指导是一位真正的白眉拳功夫大师：Benjamin Colussi——他曾经前往佛山，拜师于白眉拳大师刘伟新，学成之后回到法国开设了武馆，潜心钻研并传播中国功夫。 
6.《师父》中玩家所处的武馆里，有一个供奉师父的牌位，游戏中的对联是完全复刻于白眉拳大师刘伟新与其弟子Benjamin Colussi武馆中的装潢。上联：学武学艺学仁义；下联：尊祖尊师尊武德；横批：武学之道。现实中牌位上供奉的宗师是：佛山白眉拳一代宗师刘少良；而游戏中将牌位上供奉的照片换为了主角的父亲。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[春节假期结束了，不知道大家这个年过得怎么样？在疫情下，春节热闹十足的场面似乎已成了我们记忆里的宝藏。同样深埋在记忆里的，还有那些经典老片。
得益于电影工作者近年来的努力，曾经那些耳熟能详的经典电影现在很多都有了 4K 修复版。这些影片当中既包括红色经典影片，又包括动画片，还包括一些体育片、歌舞片。部分经典电影的 4K 修复版可以在网上观看，比如西瓜视频推出的 西瓜视频大风车小剧场 中有很多修复版的经典动画片；而另一部分则已经在院线上映，观众可以至影院观看。
当然，对于那些对经典影片情有独钟的观众，网易也有一个 公版影像典藏计划，目前该计划收集了中外 613 条影像内容。感兴趣的朋友也可以移步直接观看原版。
电影修复的老手艺与新科技
电影是第七艺术，其原理是利用了视觉暂留现象。在电影中，那些看似连续的画面实则是由一帧帧单独的照片组成，这一帧帧单独的照片构成了（下文中将会提到的）电影修复的基础。在人类迈向数字时代以前，胶片是记录电影的载体。无论是早期的无声电影，还是后期的有声电影，都是用电影胶片记录的。
摄影机、电影《蝴蝶之舞》胶片与胶卷放映机。左一来自 UNsplash，其他来自维基百科
电影胶片对环境的要求比较苛刻。绝大部分胶片的存储环境并不理想，导致其使用寿命大大缩短，并容易产生一系列的问题，比如「齿孔收缩、酸化、划痕、霉斑、药膜脱落」等。不知道你有没有留意过，童年村口大荧幕上的电影画面总是充满了斑驳与闪烁。（这种印象之深，以至于认为电影本该如此。）而实际上，这就是胶片电影在存放、使用与流转过程中发生的胶片受损。
老电影 修复 通常包括三个阶段：物理修复、数字扫描和数字修复。这里拣着感兴趣的点，我们一起来围观一下。
物理修复
我们先从胶片的物理修复看起。胶片的物理修复是一门老手艺。套用一句话「我在故宫修文物」，即「我在电影制片厂修胶片」。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[theme: smartblue
相信大家已经都在对 Flutter 2.10 版本跃跃欲试，本篇就目前升级用 Flutter 2.10 版本遇到的问题做一些总结提炼。
事实上按照 Flutter 每个版本的投入使用规律，应该是第三个小版本最稳，以 Flutter 目前庞大的用户量，每次正式版的发布必然带来各种奇奇怪怪的问题，一般情况下我推荐 2.10 版本等到 2.10.3 发布再投入生产会更稳妥，但是如果你等不及官方 hotfix ，那么后面的内容可能可以帮助到你。
本次如果你是从 2.8 升级的到 2.10 ，那么 dart 层需要调整几乎等于零。
Kotlin 版本
首先就项目升级的第一个，也就是最重要的一个，就是升级你的 kotlin 插件版本，这个是强制的，因为之前的旧版本使用的基本都是 1.3.x 的版本，而这些 Flutter 2.10 强制要求 1.5.31 以上的版本。
buildscript {
-    ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'
+    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'

这里需要注意，这次升级 Kotlin 版本，会带来一些 Kotlin 包的 API 出现一些 break 的变化 ，所以如果你本身 App 使用了较多 Kotlin 开发，或者插件里使用了一些 Kotlin 的包，就需要注意升级带来的适配成本，例如：
ProducerScope 需要 override 新的 trySend 方法，但是这个方法需要 return 一个 ChannelResult ， ChannelResult 是  @InternalCoroutinesApi 。
Gradle 版本
因为 Kotlin 版本升级了，所以 AGP 插件必须使用最低 4.0.0 配合 Gradle 6.1.1 的版本，也就是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[随着人们卫生意识的提高，人们越发重视「菊花」的清洁，市场上兼具清洁、烘干、加热功能的智能马桶也渐渐普及。便后冲洗，洗去残留的粪便，还带烘干，保证了肛周的干燥环境，这是人类在便后清洁这件事上的大进步。
但显然，并不是每个家庭中都有条件配备自动冲洗马桶，对于租房者来说，换装智能马桶盖的机会可能也没有。至于公共场所，就更难以寻得良厕。如此一来，想要呵护菊花、远离疾病，湿厕纸就成了方便快捷的不二之选。
「菊花」带来的问题
粪便是脏的，这是一个再浅显不过的常识。打小家长就教导我们，每次如厕之后都要擦干净，不然会生病。屁股擦不干净，粪便有残留，里面的细菌自然就容易滋生繁殖，进而引起疾病，甚至出现反复，比如胃肠道疾病，以及肛周疾病如肛周脓肿等。
正常情况，人体排出的粪便中 1/3 到 2/3 的固体成分都是肠道菌群，这些是共生在我们的肠道中，辅助我们消化吸收的「益生菌」，比如乳酸菌、消化性球菌、消化链球菌等等。而当人体本身患有胃肠道疾病时，粪便中便可能携带有害的细菌，即致病菌、病原菌。
粪便中常见的病原菌有引起痢疾的志贺菌属、引起食物中毒或败血症的沙门杆菌、也有致病性大肠杆菌、金黄色葡萄球菌等，都能引起程度不等的胃肠道疾病。早在 2001 年，美国亚利桑那大学的一项研究 发现，平均每条内裤含有 0.1 克的粪便，最高可达 10 克，而如果是一个感染了沙门杆菌的患者，这些残留在内裤的 0.1 克粪便，就可能含有 1 亿到 10 亿的沙门氏菌。致病性肠道细菌又往往通过粪口传播1，残留在粪便中的细菌，极可能会成为疾病传染的源头。
因此，便后擦干净，不仅是为了我们自己的肛周安全，也是为了身边人的健康着想。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Falkon 的最新版本带来了截屏功能和基于 PDFium 的 PDF 阅读器以及其他改进。




如果你是 KDE 的粉丝，你肯定接触过，甚至使用过 Falkon。所以，你一定会惊喜地发现，KDE 已经成功地为他们的网络浏览器发布了新的重大升级。

与其他主流网络浏览器不同，Falkon 的更新并不频繁。这个最新发布的版本是一个令人兴奋的更新，在间隔了近三年之后！

补充一句，Falkon 是一个建立在 QtWebEngine 上的简单的开源网络浏览器。它最初被称为 QupZilla，后来在 KDE 旗下被重新命名为 Falkon。

虽然并不是新浏览器，它早在 2010 年就发布了，但它为普通用户提供了一种极简的浏览体验。



Falkon 3.2.0 有什么新内容？

即使你现在安装的是最新版本，Falkon 也没有定期提供安全更新。

因此，你可以考虑将 Falkon 作为满足特定要求的浏览器或作为辅助浏览器。

下面是这个版本的新内容：

截屏和 PDF 阅读器支持

最新的版本带来了急需的截屏功能和可选的基于 PDFium 的 PDF 阅读器。这两个都是基于 Qt 5.13 的版本。

主题和插件

对下载主题和扩展的初步支持也被添加进来了，同时偏好菜单也显示了对 KDE 商店的链接。此外，用户现在也可以删除本地安装的主题和插件。



书签

由于有了上下文菜单项，用户现在可以创建文件夹并存储书签。人们已经注意到，填充书签栏和创建顶级的书签的能力已经没有了。

其他功能


在 Falkon 中添加的一个非常常见但又必不可少的功能是暂停或恢复下载的能力。

更新的 CookieManager 现在允许同时选择一个以上的 cookie。

首选项扩展现在可以筛选查找。

用户现在可以通过上下文菜单分离标签。

现在包括 NetworkManager 集成。


要了解更多关于所有的技术变化，你可以参考 官方发布说明。



总结

Falkon 的最新版本表明 KDE 仍然计划继续支持它。这对 KDE 爱好者来说是个好消息，特别是对那些使用 Falkon 的人来说。但是，现在说他们是否计划定期推送更新，使其成为日常浏览的理想选择，还为时过早。

如果你觉得一个简单的、轻量级的网络浏览器就可以，而且有很好的广告屏蔽功能，一个与 KDE 桌面融合的浏览器，Falkon 是一个必须尝试的东西。

安装是非常直接的。你可以在你的软件库中找到它，或者使用 Flatpak 或 Snap 包 安装它。如果你想知道，它也可用于 Windows 用户。


下载 Falkon 3.2.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[提供一个适当的 CMake 配置文件来使其他人可以更容易地构建、使用和贡献你的项目。




这篇文章是使用开源 DevOps 工具进行 C/C++ 开发系列文章的一部分。如果你从一开始就把你的项目建立在一个功能强大的工具链上，你的开发会更快和更安全。除此之外，这会使别人更容易地参与你的项目。在这篇文章中，我将搭建一个基于 CMake 和 VSCodium 的 C/C++ 构建系统。像往常一样，相关的示例代码可以在 GitHub 上找到。

我已经测试了在本文中描述的步骤。这是一种适用于所有平台的解决方案。

为什么用 CMake ？

CMake 是一个构建系统生成器，可以为你的项目创建 Makefile。乍一看简单的东西可能相当地复杂。在较高的层次上，你可以定义你的项目的各个部分（可执行文件、库）、编译选项（C/C++ 标准、优化、架构）、依赖关系项（头文件、库），和文件级的项目结构。CMake 使用的这些信息可以在文件 CMakeLists.txt 中获取，它使用一种特殊的描述性语言编写。当 CMake 处理这个文件时，它将自动地侦测在你的系统上已安装的编译器，并创建一个用于启动它的 Makefile 文件。

此外，在 CMakeLists.txt 中描述的配置，能够被很多编辑器读取，像 QtCreator、VSCodium/VSCode 或 Visual Studio 。

示例程序

我们的示例程序是一个简单的命令行工具：它接受一个整数来作为参数，输出一个从 1 到所提供输入值的范围内的随机排列的数字。

$ ./Producer 10
3 8 2 7 9 1 5 10 6 4 


在我们的可执行文件中的 main() 函数，我们只处理输入的参数，如果没有提供一个值（或者一个不能被处理的值）的话，就退出程序。

Monoliths can be as good as anything... on the technical side, but something some people fail to consider is the Dev Experience.
People will be working with them, not only now, but in the future.
Even if you start small today, in a few years, maybe dozens or more people will have to use it... and well... they won’t like using it.
If you’re a developer... you’re probably nodding right now.
What would you say if I showed a 1500 lines file?
You would probably be like: “What the hell?”
Even with a proper organization... dozens or hundreds of classes and functions are something overwhelming.
Then why a monolith with dozens or hundreds of files is “not a problem”? Even with a proper organization, its scope is too big to grasp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I'm a college student majoring in web development.
https://shihokazama-portfolio-miacan2021.vercel.app/
Today, I'll share my experience of how I learned React. Hopefully, It will be helpful to someone who is a beginner at coding and struggling to understand React.
I entered my college in Apr 2021. 
https://eager-knuth-847dfa.netlify.app/
I started studying React in June but It didn't work. I couldn't understand React at all, even after watching several tutorials and googling "React for beginners" lots of times.
Some web developers said you don't need to study Javascript a lot, we don't use Javascript. We use React. So, you have to study React, not Javascript.
a JavaScript library. 
I wrote the whole code (add cart, delete cart, shop items are in class etc...) in Javascript. I didn't copy others' code at all, I thought myself how I operate it in Javascript. I was sure I have a solid knowledge of vanilla JS at last!
https://gracious-khorana-5ef5d7.netlify.app/
I restarted my React learning in September. I could understand it easily!!!
I created my first React project in September it was a chatbot.
https://vigorous-hoover-828c01.netlify.app/
And I made a weather app using API in September.
https://happy-hawking-f6969d.netlify.app/
I wrote an article about React Hooks in December.
https://dev.to/miacan2021/my-memorandum-react-hooks-usecontext-usereducer-usememo-usecallback-useref-3i4k
And then, I created React Redux project in December.
https://focustube.vercel.app/
I'm sure I'm growing as a front-end developer very fast.
Through this process, I think I have escaped from being a complete programming beginner. I learned that understanding a programming language takes a certain amount of time and that it is important to build up a solid knowledge base.
Thank you.]]></summary>

On smaller device sizes, the content was spilling out of the viewport, causing a horizontal scroll, like this:

Now, I've felt this pain many, many times. But there's no need to lose sleep anymore. Here's how I debug my page layouts to find out what's up — with just one line of CSS.
Add the following code snippet to your CSS file or your browser dev tools.

This line of CSS adds a red outline (or whatever colour you choose) to every single element (*) on your page. By scrolling through the content, you should be able to see whi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[React has two types of components - functional & class. Traditionally, only class components were allowed to have state and lifecycle methods. However, that changed with the introduction of hooks in React 16.8.
Now functional components also have access to state and lifecycle methods. For simple states, we use the useState hook and for handling more complex states, we use the useReducer hook. For the lifecycle methods, we use the useEffect hook.
In this article, we will be covering the useState hook in an in-depth fashion. The ultimate goal of this article is to hopefully make sure that you don't have to go elsewhere to learn more about useState.
Hooks were introduced to React in version 16.8. They are just regular JavaScript functions. Hooks helps us "hook into" state and lifecycle method…]]></summary>

Unfortunately, although I'd love to answer everyone, I don't have the time. Instead of answering everyone individually, I decided to write a detailed breakdown of how I became a developer advocate.
To be clear, people take many different routes into Developer Relations, so my route is not the only way and not the best. My path to DevRel could've been shorter and more straightforward. Similar to those asking me, I was also dying to figure out how to get into Developer Relations. A year ago, I was also sliding into DMs asking the same question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fim de tentar agilizar, minimamente que seja, o início de um dia de trabalho, procurei uma forma de automatizar a abertura do VS Code no projeto e o start do servidor da API.
Digitava esses comandos todas as vezes e agora só preciso digitar apiMission.sh que tudo fica pronto para codar no projeto.
O código abaixo foi salvo no arquivo apiMission.sh na pasta Scripts dentro da pasta do meu usuário na minha máquina.
echo "🤖 Opening API project in VSCode..."
cd /home/eraldo/Work/mission-brasil/api
code .
sleep 2
echo "✅ Done!"
sleep 1
echo "🤖 Starting server..."
sleep 1
yarn start:dev

Depois tornei esse arquivo executável.
sudo chmod +x apiMission.sh
Só com isso já poderia executar o ./apiMission.sh, dentro da pasta Scripts, que o projeto seria aberto no VSCode e o servidor iria iniciar.
Mas aí há a possibilidade de colocar essa pasta no path do sistema para digitar apiMission.sh em qualquer lugar para iniciar rodar o script.
No meu caso, que uso Linux, inseri a linha abaixo no arquivo .profile
PATH="$PATH:/home/eraldo/Scripts"
Agora é só abrir o terminal e rodar apiMission.sh para iniciar o projeto da API e começar a codar nele.
Observações:
Ainda é um script bem básico. Estarei verficando a possibilidade de retorno da mensagem de confirmação após o programa realmente abrir e, em caso de erro, parar a execução do script.. algo nessa linha.
Estou verificando se há a possibilidade de executar o script em um terminal e realizar comandos em outra janela... o intuito é abrir editor nos projetos e iniciar api e frontend rodando um único script.]]></summary>

有时候选择比较少也是一件好事，例如在 React 中通常只盛行一到两个状态管理解决方案，而Flutter 自从 2020 年末开始，每个月似乎都有新的状态管理方案出现，因此这里主要罗列出它们的一些优劣，从而帮助你选择最适合的状态管理方案。
基础
一般在无需修改 pubspec.yaml文件的情况下，你默认有两种状态管理解决方案可以选择，大多数时候这就足够了。
setState

setState 仅在本地范围内有效，如果一个 Widget 需要改变它自己的状态，那么 setState 就是你最好的选择。
例如：修改开关是打开还是关闭，或者存储改变正在输入的文本内容，这种场景你真的不需要考虑任何其它状态管理包。
我的经验法则是：如果只在此 Widget 中需要有状态变量，或者在该控件树下恰好只有 1 个上下的 Widget，则它属于本地范围，这时候直接使用 StatefulWidget 是最合适不过。
如果你需要将状态在控件树内向下传递树，那么只需将变量放在子 Widget 的构造函数中；如果相同的变量需要传递到 2+  Widget 的构造函数，那么这时候才需要研究更高范围的状态管理。
InheretedWidget
前面我们在 setState 中讨论的那个开关，如果它是控制应用是处于暗模式还是亮模式，如果在这种情况下，你就需要将状态提升到可以更好地沿控件树传播的某个位置。
而在你使用第三方框架去完成这个需求时，让我们看一下 InheretedWidget 。
InheretedWidget 允许它下面的任何 Widget 访问它的属性，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我们是《师父》的开发团队Slocap，出于对中国功夫与中华文化的敬意与热爱，我们团队用心创作了《师父》这款游戏，真诚地希望你们能够喜欢！我们也将认真听取你们的反馈，尽最大努力改进游戏！ 
《师父》是一款以中国风作为设计主题、中国城市作为游戏背景、中国功夫白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的动作冒险游戏。玩家将扮演一位踏上复仇之路的功夫学徒，独自一人闯入危机四伏的现代江湖。 我们渴望创造出一场真正具有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅。

如何评价我们的游戏，这个应该交由每一位玩家来定夺，这才是最为公允、客观的方式。作为制作了这款游戏的独立开发团队，我们只在这里简要介绍一下游戏的各个方面，来给新入手或者感兴趣的玩家一些指引和帮助吧！ 
游戏首发支持中文字幕，后续即将更新加入中文配音！我们认为《师父》作为一款以中国功夫、中华文化为主题的游戏，中国玩家的认可和支持是十分重要的，我们也在不断改善游戏的中文本地化，并且与上海的专业配音团队合作，努力为玩家带来优秀的中文游戏体验。 
我们努力让游戏的战斗玩法足够有趣、真实、丰富且具有挑战性！游戏的战斗系统，以中国传统功夫白眉拳作为基础的招式体系，追求拳拳到肉的爽快战斗体验。融合白眉拳刚强凶猛、变化莫测的特点，玩家作为一代功夫学徒，在战斗中会使用多种攻击方式， 经过经验积累，可以解锁丰富的招式技能：例如过肩摔、扫堂腿、回旋踢等传统功夫招式； 通过多种武器的综合使用，结合武器技能，创造独特的战斗方式； 格挡、闪避、架势（体系）条的设计，以及多种处决技，令攻防都需小心谨慎； 专注度可以提供一个“子弹时间”式的额外招式，打乱敌人的战斗节奏。

我们想要创作一个独一无二的成长与死亡系统。每次死亡会使年龄增长，并且解锁不同年龄下的战斗技能，使玩家能够构筑独一无二的玩法思路。本作采用十分独特的成长机制：玩家在生命值归零后，会短暂倒下，再次复苏时会使年龄增长； 年龄增长…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub 推出赞助商专属存储库

几年前，GitHub 引入了赞助功能，允许任何人财务赞助开源开发者。而现在，GitHub 推出了 赞助商专属存储库，也就是只有赞助商才能访问的私人存储库。这些存储库可以分为不同的赞助级别。有了赞助商专属仓库，开发者不仅可以募集捐款，还可以更好地与赞助商（企业或其他）进行更深入、更个性化的接触。


老王点评：虽然这样使受益和付出更一致，但是，与开源的关系呢？我觉得将来的发展未必是人们所期望的。




Go 语言正在测试对泛型和模糊处理的支持

Go 1.18 本周发布了 第二个测试版。在 1.18 中，通过 Go 语言服务器和 VSCode 扩展可以支持泛型。此外，还引入了模糊处理和新的 Go 工作区模式。Go 1.18 的测试版被证明是非常可靠的，谷歌称，“事实上，我们已经在谷歌这里的生产中运行它”。候选发布版也有望在本月晚些时候发布，最终的 Go 1.18 版预计在 3 月发布。


老王点评：Go 这样活跃开发的语言，只要坐等就可以预期不断有很多新特性和性能提升。




GNU/Hurd 使用 NetBSD 驱动程序来支持硬件

GNU/Hurd 的硬件支持一直处于非常粗糙的状态，缺乏完整的 x86_64 支持，缺少 USB 支持，最近才有一定程度的对声音的支持。即使它比 Linux 内核存在的时间更长，仍然还有漫长的道路需要走。它的开发者在 FOSDEM 2022 上说，他们在微内核环境中重新使用 NetBSD 内核驱动，以扩大 Hurd 的硬件支持范围。


老王点评：Hurd 发展的太慢了，不过这样可以利用其它系统的硬件驱动倒是一个好主意。]]></summary>

Problem：
看来这个游戏的重点在*胜利*，全部战线上都不允许有任何败绩。商业投资和创业产业上要赢，爱与人际关系上要赢，政治上要赢，意识形态上要赢，妈的，甚至在性的方面也要赢。肯定还涉及了一大堆与物质相关的胜利 —— 你要把某件东西成功地搞到手，绝对不能弄丢。但问题来了：我们眼前并没多少赢家，绝大部分人都在溃败。怎么会这样？你又怎么可能立于*不败*之地呢？

本来想说，今年的年度总结在公司的公众号交了一篇差。那么再往后去探讨一些话题其实就没有必要了。但是在写作这篇文章开始的一周，到处传出来的却是裁员的声音。从心动开始，B站跟进。此外还有很多内部确认了但外部没有确认的消息在蔓延。
缩编，裁撤，项目停滞。这是2022年中国游戏行业的开端。与2021年Clubhouse的群贤毕至相比，2022年的前景显得并不是那么光明。
与之相对的是，我们仍然可以看到年会照片里堆成山的PS5，iPhone或是各式各样的高科技硬通货，由游戏行业参与者们所组成的二手交易群里仍然是火热的交易信息。在更早一些的时候，吉比特就传出过奖励明星项目制作人一套房子的新闻。如果你跟年轻一些的社群有交集的话，你会不可避免地发现，前来游戏行业淘金俨然是一种主流。
一方面是裁员的信息，一方面是仍然是直白的物质驱动。在2022年初这个时间点，作为局中人，我们很难说这会是很好过的一年；但要是与其它的行当相比，那么好像还有那么些侥幸可以去钻。



如此我们不得不回望2021年的国内游戏市场，这个市场到底是什么样的？

既然决定留深过年，总得找点风景怡人的地方逛一逛，深圳湾就是这样一个好地方。深圳湾公园毗邻蛇口、南山等深圳最繁华的区域，沿线能同时欣赏到漂亮的城市景观和自然风光；作为一处海滨开放式公园，深圳湾又有着怡人的空气和广阔的活动空间。不仅如此，深圳湾公园不是简单的步行通道，其沿线还有各种主题公园和活动场所，无论你想在假期期间一个人静静还是陪家人走走，亦或带孩子玩玩，深圳湾公园都是安全又舒适的好去处。
除了欣赏风景，深圳湾也是我进行街头摄影最多的去处，沿途能遇见各种各样有趣的人和场面，每次前往都能找到新鲜点。正因为去得多了，所以我对深圳湾非常熟悉，也充满感情。在本期城市漫步指南中，我想带你前往深圳湾，来一趟完整的深圳海滨之旅。
注：本文除部分地图截图已注明出处外，其余均使用 OpenStreetMap 截取和修改。
深圳湾公园在哪里？
深圳湾，又称「后海湾」，是位于深圳市和香港特别行政区之间的一个海湾，处于珠江的入海口末端。由于其被深圳蛇口半岛和香港元朗平原半包围而形成了一片夹在深圳和香港之间的半开放内海，也因此形成了深港隔海相望的独特景观。

二十一世纪初，深圳市政府联合多家机构和单位，历经八年的规划和建设，在深圳湾沿海一带修建了深圳湾公园。深圳湾公园全称「深圳湾海滨城市公园」，南临深圳湾公路大桥，东至红树湾自然保护区，全长约十三公里。深圳湾公园整体分为「滨海休闲带」和「生态公园」两个部分，两者分别为南北、东西走向的两条通道，组合在一起恰好在地图上构成了一个标准的直角造型。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[编注：
本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #效率 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

「效率」，放置在个人和整体中，这是一个做事的时候皆需要考虑的词。在个人层面上，我们谈论「效率」时，通常它的前面会有一个修饰语，比如「学习效率」、「工作效率」。在我们说提高效率的时候，指的是在做一件事时，能够用更快的速度，更简单的方式实现它。高效也是一个大多数人都关心的话题，而且「如何利用各种效率工具让自己变得更高效」，似乎已经成为了一个预设好的、默认的好的事情。
在 2021 年，我也不出意外地使用了很多软件、尝试了很多种工具，主要包括知识的获取和整理，时间和日程的管理。与之前不同，我的一大改变是不再追求更复杂更齐全的功能，更倾向使用简单的、但可以达到核心需求的工具。
效率背后的逻辑
在聊具体的效率工具之前，我们先捋一捋效率背后的逻辑。
有效、无效和半有效时间
提高效率，换一个说法就是节省时间。从时间这个角度出发，我们先分解我们平时在工作和学习时花费的时间，看看我们到底把时间花在了哪里。如果把工作或者学习的时间摊开来看，可以把整块时间分成三块，分别是有效时间、半有效时间和无效时间。
有效时间指的是那些真正有突出的进展的时间，它只占整块时间的很小一部分。突出的进展就类似解决了某个 bug，看懂了某个原理。这样的时间也可以被认为是做事时真正有用的时间。
所谓无效时间指的是做一件事情的过程中完全不用花的时间，这段时间纯粹是无用时间。举个例子，如果要使用远程服务器跑一段程序，那么设置 IDE 的远程连接可以说是在这个场景下最优的做法，而其他的方法，比如将代码文…]]></summary>

不是只有在一个大型公司工作才需要使用负载平衡器。你可能是一个业余爱好者，用几台树莓派电脑自我托管一个网站。也许你是一个小企业的服务器管理员；也许你确实在一家大公司工作。无论你的情况如何，你都可以使用 HAProxy 负载平衡器来管理你的流量。

HAProxy 被称为“世界上最快和使用最广泛的软件负载平衡器”。它包含了许多可以使你的应用程序更加安全可靠的功能，包括内置的速率限制、异常检测、连接排队、健康检查以及详细的日志和指标。学习本教程中所涉及的基本技能和概念，将有助于你使用 HAProxy 建立一个更强大的、远为强大的基础设施。

为什么需要一个负载平衡器？

负载平衡器是一种在几个网络或应用服务器之间轻松分配连接的方法。事实上，HAProxy 可以平衡任何类型的传输控制协议（TCP）流量，包括 RDP、FTP、WebSockets 或数据库连接。分散负载的能力意味着你不需要因为你的网站流量比谷歌大就购买一个拥有几十万 G 内存的大型网络服务器。

负载平衡器还为你提供了灵活性。也许你现有的网络服务器不够强大，无法满足一年中繁忙时期的峰值需求，你想增加一个，但只是暂时的。也许你想增加一些冗余，以防一个服务器出现故障。有了 HAProxy，你可以在需要时向后端池添加更多的服务器，在不需要时删除它们。

你还可以根据情况将请求路由到不同的服务器。例如，你可能想用几个缓存服务器（如 Varnish）来处理你的静态内容，但把任何需要动态内容的东西，如 API 端点，路由到一个更强大的机器。

在这篇文章中，我将通过设置一个非常基本的 HAProxy 环境，使用 HTTPS 来监听安全端口 443，并利用几个后端 Web 服务器。它甚至会将所有进入预定义 URL（如 /api/）…]]></summary>

There are some awesome frameworks like remix.run , next.js, astro or 11ty, which allow you to use one of (or both) techniques. So if you're building a production app, I recommend using one of them because server-side rendering is quite hard to get right.
But if you want to understand how it works and what is happening under the hood in these frameworks, you definately should try it out. This article will focus on how SSR works and we will also go through a simple example of using SSR.
Server-side rendering means rendering the initial HTML on the server instead of waiting for the JavaScript to be loaded in the browser and then rendering.

Many people ask the question “How to start developing?” because when you are beginner, you don't know nothing about coding.
So, I decided to write a quick introduction to web development: How to start creating websites and apps even if you are a complete noob.
Everyone that want to become a great developer need to know at least the basics of HTML and CSS. These technologies are understood by the most famous chromes(Google Chrome, Firefox, internet explore, Brave and others). HTML will help to add elements and text and CSS will add style to it.
In addition you need to know javascript, because javascript technology beacause it will make the website …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I posted a review on The Choice, the first book for Dr. Edith Eger. It's a book that is mostly an autobiography of a Holocaust survivor, but it's much more than a recital of what happened to her during the year that she spent at death camps. 
The book was published in 2017, 72 years after she was deliberated at the age of 17. She had way more to share than the horror.
Her second book, The Gift is the condensed version of what the author learnt as a psychologist both from herself and from her patients about leading a happy life. A life that is not full of resentment and hate. A life in which you could let things go and forgive yourself and others.
The lessons, her messages are organized around 12 prisons you lock yourself up to.
I'm not going to discuss them one by one here…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn what parameters, arguments, and return statements are with videos and animations.
Let’s understand what is a JavaScript Parameter & Argument.
general idea of a function, function definition & function invocation.
Table Of Contents:
JavaScript Variables in Functions

JavaScript Functions-Parameters & Arguments

JavaScript return statement
JavaScript functions can also contain variables.
addNumbers() to demonstrate.
function addNumbers() {
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const sum = a + b; // 5 + 10
return sum;
}
console.log(addNumbers());


Code Explanation:
{}, we have 3 variables a, b and sum, with values.
return keyword.
addNumbers();.
But we can change the above code, using parameters & arguments to replace variable declaration and assignment.
JavaScript function parameters are the names (placeholders) for values.
arguments are the actual values of parameters.
Let me explain it to you like we are having a street conversation, or talk in an informal language.
Parameters are variable names. The word parameter is just a fancy word for saying variable name in JS.
Arguments are the actual values of those variables. The word argument is just another fancy word for saying variable value

So we use parameters(variable names) to refer to argument (variable values)
Makes sense? Let's see it in code, or better convert the above function's variables & their values to parameters & arguments.
function addNumbers(a, b) {
const sum = a + b; // 5 + 10
return sum;
}
console.log(addNumbers(5, 10));

Code Explanation:
{}.
().
addNumbers(5, 10).
Most people can’t see the relationship between parameters & arguments (including myself).
Notice, we don’t need to use a JavaScript keyword const, let or var to declare the variables a and b, inside the () parentheses.
The JavaScript return statement as it sounds, it returns something.

The photos, comments, user information, etc. is data. To keep it available to everyone it needs to be stored somewhere so when I make a request to see Kanye West's Instagram profile I can see everything he's posted (that is, if he doesn't delete all of his posts for his next Yeezy campaign).
If we think about what else would be stored in Instagram's databases we would start to get overwhelmed (and we have every right to be, it's a lot of data)! How can we store a large amount of information in a clean, concise way? We do this by creating a relational database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These problems appeared in leecode and featured in various blogs, i have just summarised and included them using ts-problems deck.
Numbers generally increase in a roman numeral notation from right to left, any subtractive number must also be smaller than our current res.
So we can avoid the need for an extra variable here. We do run into the case of repeated numerals causing an issue III, but we can clear that by multiplying num by any number between 2 and 4 before comparing it to res, since the numerals jump in value by 5x.
Once we know how to properly identify a subtractive numeral, it's a simple matter to just iterate in reverse through given numeral to find and return the res.
function romanToInt(s: string): number {
  let res: number = 0;
  const symbols = {
    I: 1,
    V: 5,
    X: 10,
    L: 50,
    C: 100,
    D: 500,
    M: 1000,
  };
  s.split("")
    .reverse()
    .forEach((char) => {
      let val: number = parseInt(symbols[char]);
      if (res > 4 * val) {
        res -= val;
      } else {
        res += val;
      }
    });
  return res;
}

This solution uses a lookup table composed which can help in easier conversion and much simple compared to the above one.
function intToRoman(num: number): string {
  let res:string = "";
  const value:number [] = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];
  const numerals:string [] = ["M","CM","D","CD","C","XC","L","XL","X","IX","V","IV","I"]
  for (let i = 0; num; i++)
    while (num >= value[i]){
        res += numerals[i];
         num -= value[i];
    }
  return res;
}

Here I have tried to solve them in typescript using ts-problems repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I will show you how to create a simple login page in Python with the flask library and finally with gunicorn.
let's begin!
Create the virtual env:
in the project directory :
python3 -m venv myenv
Then the linux command to activate the new env:
source /myenv/bin/activate
Now we are in our dev env.
From here install the flask library :
pip install flask
Now we can start to develop our flask app.
Create a file that you can call mylogin.py
In this file :
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, request

app = Flask(__name__)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[经过近三年的等待，Peppermint OS 11 来了，放弃了以 Ubuntu 作为其基础，并删除了 LXDE 组件。看起来不错！




Peppermint OS 11 是 2022 年最值得期待的版本 之一，而它终于到来了！

2020年，其主要开发者 Mark Greaves 不幸去世，Peppermint OS 失去了它最重要的贡献者之一。

现在，经过近两年的时间，Peppermint 11 来了！这不仅仅是一次普通的升级，Peppermint 11 是它的第一个以 Debian 为基础的版本，抛弃了 Ubuntu。

让我在下面指出该版本的所有关键细节。

Peppermint 11 有什么新东西？

该版本的主要亮点是放弃 Ubuntu，使用 Debian 64 位作为其基础。

从技术上讲，它基于 Debian 11 “Bullseye” 的稳定分支。因此，你可以预期 Debian 的最新改进出现在 Peppermint OS 11 中。

除了新的基础之外，还有一些其他的变化，包括：

XFce 4.16.2，无 LXDE 组件



Peppermint OS 利用 XFce 桌面环境与 LXDE 组件来提供混合体验。

Peppermint 11 已经删除了所有的 LXDE 组件，专注于提供一个 XFce 驱动的桌面体验。

Calamares 安装程序取代了 Ubiquity



为了改善安装过程，Peppermint 11 使用了现代 Calamares 安装程序。

新的欢迎应用程序



为了让你有一个良好的开端，Peppermint OS 现在包括一个新的欢迎应用程序，让你了解更多关于所使用的系统/组件，并安装开始使用所需的软件。

例如，你在 Peppermint 11 中没有预装默认的网络浏览器。你可以快速启动软件包选择器，安装 Firefox、GNOME、Tor、Falkon 和 Chromium 等浏览器。



新的 Peppermint Hub

新的 Peppermint Hub 合并了设置和控制中心来保持整洁，帮助你轻松管理系统。



新的应用程序

该版本包括一个基于终端的广告屏蔽器，即 hblock，可以在需要时启用或禁用。



Nemo 取代了 Thunar 作为默认的文件管理器，它应该感觉很熟悉，对许多用户来说可以派上用场。

其他改进

总的来说，有了新的基础和更新的 Linux 内核 5.10，Peppermint 11 应该是一个令人兴奋的选择。

在 发布说明 中的一些其他变化包括：


在安装过程中包含了一套精简的桌面墙纸。下载额外的壁纸请进入 Peppermint 中。

包括一套精简的图标和 XFce 主题。


现在 Peppermint OS 11 来了，你会考虑在你的主系统上尝试一下吗？你已经试过了吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。

My favorite thing recently? The days are getting longer.
On our way to dinner tonight at 5:30p we were driving along and it was still light out! 
Then we got to sit inside at one of our favorite restaurants, and noted that we hadn’t been inside of the restaurant for two years. We’ve had takeout, and eaten many meals in the car in the parking lot, but tonight we actually got to sit down at a table inside. 
It was delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果改变隐私设置将导致 Meta 明年损失一百亿美元

之前，苹果默认允许广告商在移动设备上跟踪用户，但用户可以手动关闭跟踪。去年苹果以隐私保护的理由改变了这一行为，要求应用向用户询问是否愿意被跟踪。调查显示，54% 的苹果用户在看到该通知之后选择不要跟踪。苹果的这一变动降低了定位广告的准确度，进而降低了对广告商的吸引力。Meta 称，这将导致该公司在 2022 年 损失一百亿美元，占到了 2021 年收入的 8%。而雪上加霜的是，谷歌也准备在安卓中引入了类似的变动。

顺便说一句，Facebook 18 年历史上它的 日活用户首次下降。


老王点评：虽然这保护了隐私，但是我觉得广告商们不会这样坐以待毙，或许我们会见到更多广告位？




Meta 将引入虚拟现实形象之间的强制性距离

Meta 公司 VR 应用“地平线世界”的测试用户抱怨在网上被摸，呼吁在他们的虚拟现实形象周围建立一个保护性的气泡。Meta 公司 周五宣布，它正在旗下两个 VR 应用上引入个人界限，人与人之间的距离将相当于 VR 中的四英尺。


老王点评：不过，某些场景下我们需要更近的距离，或许可以设置个亲密白名单。




微软正式禁用 MSIX 应用安装协议

微软 正式宣布，它已经禁用了 MSIX 应用安装程序协议（ms-appinstaller:）以防止恶意攻击。该协议允许用户直接从网络服务器上安装各种应用程序，而不需要先将其下载到本地。然而，这种 Windows 应用程序安装方式后来被发现用来分发恶意的 PDF 文件。微软表示，它正在研究如何在未来某个时候以安全的方式重新启用该协议，比如添加某些组策略。


老王点评：本意是出于方便，但是却被利用。很多事情都是这样，便利和安全彼此抵触。


回音

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[城市是一个复杂的有机体。流动的车辆和人流，变化的红绿灯，漂浮的云彩……我们一般会说「我在城市里」，是因为城市就是一个包括我们周围一切的世界。作为一个摄影爱好者，我每去到一座城市，都希望能够使用手中的相机去记录这座城市下这座城市独特的一面，但是也常常遇到一些挑战和难题。在拍摄过程中，我也积累了一些经验和教训。在这里，我将尝试从最初的拍摄想法构建开始再到拍摄过程，和大家分享一下我的城市摄影记录流程。
感受城市的氛围
来到一座城市，第一件要干的事情不是拿起相机四处寻找可以拍摄的景点。请先放下一切让你觉得累赘的东西吧！随处逛逛，感受下城市的气息。放空自己，纯粹地观察眼前城市的一切。这座城市的道路是宽阔还是狭窄？空气中飘荡的味道是怎样的？这片街区流行什么色调？道路边种植的什么植物？建筑物是什么颜色和风格？我们对于城市的理解往往就会在这个过程中一点点地累积起来。
不同城市有着自己的风格，不同的人参观同一座城市也可能有不同印象。试试闭上眼睛，尝试概括一下城市带给你什么样的印象？不一定是某个抽象的词语，可以具体到某个物件或者某个特别的场景。
我来说说我对于一些城市的印象吧。
广州
是点心蒸笼上方氤氲的热气，是晚上巷子里趟拢门里飘出来电视节目和剁肉饼的声音。
广州 恩宁路
上海
是思南路两旁一眼看不到尽头的梧桐，是走在老公寓楼梯上的「吱呀吱呀」的声音。
上海 某老式公寓
北京
是一位老爷爷对着结冰的未名湖面朗诵诗歌，是故宫里的红墙黄瓦。
北京 故宫
南京
是钟山里一抬头的葱葱绿意，是大报恩寺里佛像跨越时空的凝视。
南京 大报恩寺遗址
城市风格通过特定的场景和物件来体现，游走在城市中，慢慢感受城市的温度，培养对城市风格的触觉非常重要。因为在街拍时，一切都在瞬息万变，并不会有一位耐心的模特等你构图，对焦，按下快门。你永远无法预知自己即将会面对什么情况。但是一般来说，你所想要表达的氛围和感情却是基…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不同的 Linux 系统以不同的方式处理辅助技术。 这里是一些对视觉、听觉、打字等有用的设置。




当我在 20 世纪 90 年代开始使用 Linux 时，我已经 40 多岁了，无障碍性accessibility不是我非常关注的问题。然而现在，当我快到 70 岁时，我的需求已经改变了。几年前，我从 System76 购买了一个全新的 Darter Pro，它的默认分辨率是 1920x1080，而且也是高 DPI。系统附带了 Pop!_OS，我发现我必须修改它才能看到显示屏上的图标和文字。谢天谢地，桌面上的 Linux 已经变得比 90 年代更容易使用了。

我需要辅助技术，特别是在视觉和听觉方面。还有一些我不使用的领域，但对需要帮助打字、指点、点击和手势的人来说是有用的。

不同的系统，如 Gnome、KDE、LXDE、XFCE 和其他系统，对这些辅助技术的处理方式不同。这些辅助性的调整大多可以通过 “设置Settings” 对话框或键盘快捷键来实现。

文字显示

我需要帮助来显示较大的文字，在我的 Linux Mint Cinnamon 桌面上，我使用这些设置：



我还发现 Gnome “优化Tweaks” 可以让我对桌面体验的文字显示大小进行微调。我把我的显示器的分辨率从默认的 1920x1080 调整到更舒适的 1600x900。以下是我的布局设置：



键盘支持

我不需要键盘支持，但它们是现成支持的，如下图所示：



更多无障碍选项

在 Fedora 35 上，无障碍访问也是熟悉的。打开 “设置Settings” 菜单，选择让 “总是显示无障碍菜单Always show Accessibility Menu” 图标在桌面上可见。我通常会切换 “大字体Large Text”，除非我在一个大显示器上。还有许多其他选项，包括 “缩放Zoom”、“屏幕阅读器Screen Reader” 和 “声音键Sound Keys”。这里有一些：



当在 Fedora 的 “设置Settings” 菜单中启用了 “无障碍菜单Accessibility Menu”，就很容易从右上角的图标中切换其他功能：



有一些 Linux 发行版是专门为需要无障碍支持的人设计的。Accessible Coconut 就是这样一个发行版。Coconut 基于 Ubuntu Mate 20.04，并默认启用了屏幕阅读器。它装载了 Ubuntu Mate 的默认应用。Accessible Coconut 是 Zendalona 的作品，该公司专门开发自由开源的无障碍应用。他们所有的应用都是以 GPL 2.0 许可证发布的，包括 iBus-Braille。该发行版包括屏幕阅读器、各种语言的打印阅读、六键输入、打字辅导、放大器、电子书扬声器等等。



Gnome 无障碍套件 是一个开源软件库，是 Gnome 项目的一部分，为实现无障碍功能提供 API。你可以通过访问他们的维基来参与 Gnome 无障碍团队。KDE 也有一个 无障碍项目 和一个支持该项目的 应用 列表。你可以通过访问他们的 维基 来参与 KDE 无障碍项目。XFCE 也为用户提供了相关资源。Fedora 项目维基 也有一个可以安装在操作系统上的无障碍应用的列表。

Linux 适合所有人

自 20 世纪 90 年代以来，Linux 已经有了长足的进步，其中一个很大的进步就是对无障碍的支持。很高兴知道随着 Linux 用户的不断变化，操作系统也可以和我们一起变化，并做出许多不同的支持选项。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[带着 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS 和 KDE Plasma 5.23 的最新改进，Slackware 15.0 已经来到。




欢呼吧！Linux 粉丝们会很高兴地知道，传奇发行版 Slackware 在很久之后发布了一个新版本。或许你不知道，Slackware 上一个版本的发布要追溯到 2016 年。

当开发者在去年（2021 年）2 月宣布 Slackware 15.0 的计划时，整个 Linux 社区都为此感到兴奋。

从年初的 Alpha 版本开始，在过去的一年里，开发人员在 Slackware Linux 15.0 的开发中取得了快速进展。经过一段时间后，他们发布了其最后一个候选版本，但现在它发布了！

让我们来看看 Slackware 15.0 有哪些新内容。

Slackware 15.0 的新内容



如前所述，Slackware 15.0 有许多变化。不要忘了，在最终发布之前，它可是发布了一个测试版和两个候选发布版（RC）。

如果你一直在关注我们的报道，早在去年 4 月份你就可能已经看到了我们的 测试版 报道。

在测试版 / RC 版中，还有一些东西没有被披露。因此，在这里，我们会介绍它的所有重要内容。

Linux 内核 5.15 LTS

Slackware 15 的主要亮点是增加了最新的 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。这与我们在测试版中注意到的 Linux 内核 5.10 LTS 相比，有了很大的飞跃。



值得注意的是，Slackware 团队在确定使用 Linux 内核 5.15.19 之前测试了数百个 Linux 内核版本。在发布说明中提到：


在最终宣布 Slackware 15.0 稳定版的过程中，我们在过去一年里实际上构建了超过 400 个不同的 Linux 内核版本（相比之…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[App description needs to be updated to clearly state the source of information and whether the app represents the government entity.
When I first submitted my US Election Info app, I got rejected.

These are the details:
Disclaimer/Source: Missing Clear Source of Information/Disclaimer
So I dug a bit further and found the following requirement:
Requirements for apps that communicate government information
Since my app does not affiliate with any government, I refer to Unaffiliated apps that communicate government information section. There are 2 things that I need to do:
Clearly conveying the sources to users in the app description, and
Making clear that the app does not represent a government or political entity.
I wasn't sure, and I googled this a bit. It turned out that I need to update my App description. So I added the disclaimer at the end of the app description.
This is the exact text that I added:
Disclaimer
(1) Information on this app comes from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a>, which aggregates data across the United States on elected officials in federal, state, county and local government offices.
(2) This app does not represent any government or political entity. Your use of this information provided on this app is solely at your own risk.

Please note that you can add link in the app decription using <a> tag.
This is how the texts look like at the bottom of my app description:

After updating the app description, it gets approved!

Wow time was delivered as fast as CloudFront deliver content 😊 
Around this time last year, I was doubting myself about applying for the Community Builders program. I did some research before applying to give me some comfort. I discovered that the number of applications was huge but that was not the scariest part, the scariest part was to know that only a small selection is accepted.  I told myself well, is it all or nothing so I did it and here I am sharing my story.  
Let me share with you some questions I asked myself about this program and why was I interested in joining this community.

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
To solve the question click here:(https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
The new thing that I learned in this question is about comparator interface in java. Using a comparator, we can sort the elements based on data members. For instance, it may be on roll no, name, age, or anything else.
In this question, I used comparator to sort the intervals according to the 1st interval.

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

MainActivity的父类是AppCompatActivity 的方法，最终会调用 AppCompatDelegateImpl 的 setContentView 方法：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great way to level up any application your building is to create a simple loading animation. Today, we're going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.
Of course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we're going to worry about creating the actual spinner!

For this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).
We start with just a very simple structure in our html.
<div class="spinner">
  <img src="./rainbow.png" class="img"/>
</div>

Tip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.
To create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we'll create a keyframe animation called spin:
 @keyframes spin {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
   100% {
     transform: rotate(360deg);
   }
 }

Now, let's style our actual spinner!

We created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:
 .spinner {
   height: 100vh;
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
 }

Now, for the actual image:
 .img {
   height: 150px;
   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;
 }

Now we have a working spinner!

Types are the easy way to refer the different properties and functions available to a value in the Typescript Code.

It is the code we add to the Typescript to make the compiler aware of the type of values variable will refer to.
let age : number = 20;
let name: string = "Himanshu";
let isAdult: boolean = true;

In the example above, we explicitly tell the typescript compiler that the variable age will be of type number, name will be of type string and isAdult would be of type boolean.

In this article, we are going to use what we've learned about HTML so far to create a portfolio, which you can use to tell the world about you and your projects. Without further ado, let's get started.
First, create a work folder. This is what I did:

Everything related to the portfolio is inside the Portfolio directory. You can do this differently, but remember to be organized because we are going to add quite a few things in the future.
Next, go to Portfolio and create an HTML file. Let's call it "portfolio.html". Open it with a text editor, you can use the notepad that comes with your operating system if you want, but I recommend using a proper code editor like VS Code.

👉  万字长文 Flutter 运行机制白皮书
前面的几篇文章基本上把 Flutter 的三棵树说明白了，从三棵树的含义到三棵树的关联，从 Element 的更新到 Render 的布局。有了这些铺垫，再看 Flutter 的其他机制就更加清晰。
有人可能会问，这三棵树除了 Widget 之外，其他的离我们开发好远，看这些对我们开发有什么帮助吗？
我从下面几点来给大家抛砖引玉。
可以更好的看 Flutter 源码
Flutter framework 的源码大概分为五层：

Widgets 这一层将所有的机制都封装进了我们熟悉的 Widget 中，比如 ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget 封装了动画，CustomPaint 封装了绘制，GestureDetector 封装了手势机制等等。
开发过程中，免不了要追到源码中对比实现效果。前面我们知道 Widget 基本分为下面的几类，每一类都有基本的代码追踪策略。
StatelessWidget 代码追踪
StatelessWidget 是组合型的无状态 Widget，在build 方法中构造出子树。其对应的 Element 是 StatelessElement
此类型的 Widget，在显示层我们只需要关注其 build 方法，看构造的子树是谁。
以万金油的 Container 组件为例。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5 年后，Slackware 发布大变样的 15.0

Slackware 是最古老的仍在维护的 Linux 发行版。它的上个版本是 2016 年发布的 14.2。作为一个古老的发行版在五年后发布的 版本，这个版本中有了大幅变化：提供了 5.15.19 LTS 内核；采用 PipeWire 替代了 PulseAudio；X11 之外还提供了 Wayland；用 Qt5 替换了 Qt4；采用 PAM 替代了纯 shadow 密码方式；Postfix 默认替换了 Sendmail；Dovecot 替换了老的 imapd 和 ipop3d；elogind 替换了 ConsoleKit2；带有 Rust 和 Python 3；独有的包管理器 pkgtools 有了很大改进；桌面环境提供了 Xfce 4.16 和最新的 Plasma 5；主要的编译器是 gcc-11.2 和 llvm 13.0；默认浏览器是 Firefox 91.5esr。并且，完全没有 systemd。


老王点评：简直是一夜之间告别过去，重新粉饰新家。明天我们或许会详细解读一下。




一半的英特尔芯片漏洞是员工内部发现的

英特尔在其 年度安全报告 中指出，在 2021 年发现的 226 个 CVE 漏洞中，有一半是英特尔员工在内部发现的，其余 113 个 CVE 中，有 86% 是通过他们的 Bug Bounty 计划从外部发现的。77% 的漏洞存在于硬件/固件中，70% 的英特尔软件安全问题是外部研究人员发现的。漏洞最多的产品是他们的图形硬件/驱动程序，其次是以太网产品和其他软件。最后，他们将 CVE 数量与 AMD 进行比较，英特尔在 2021 年称其 CPU 只有 10 个 CVE，而 AMD 共有 31 个；在图形类方面，AMD 在这一年有 27 个 CVE，而英特尔有 51 个。


老王点评：虽然这些年英特尔 CPU 出现了许多严重漏洞，但是看起来他们还是相当重视的。




Mozilla 关闭了其 VR 浏览器 Firefox Reality

这个开源浏览器允许用户通过单独的 VR 和 AR 头盔访问网络，用户可以访问标准的 URL，进行搜索，并最终在 2D 网站和沉浸式网络体验之间移动。Mozilla 解释 说，它决定关闭 Firefox Reality 的原因是计划将该技术放到其他社区和组织中，这样它就可以“像 WebAssembly、Rust 和 Servo 一样继续发展并为网络作出贡献。”


老王点评：在这个元宇宙大热的时间，Mozilla 却砍掉了其开源的 VR 浏览器，这是对自己的产品能力没有信心吗？]]></summary>

祝「光字片」，涅槃重生！

@潘誉晗 ：故事围绕着北方某城市「光字片」里一户周姓人家展开。七十年代末，为了响应国家的号召，父亲前往西南参加「大三线」的建设；长子则成为第一批下乡的知青；长女周蓉生性喜欢浪漫，偷偷前往心上人所在的贵州乡村下乡。不如哥哥姐姐般优秀的老幺，则在家中与母亲相依为命。之后五十年，他们的故事将与祖国发展紧紧相连。
那边的《开端》迎来了开年「第一炸」，这边的《人世间》也我们献上了中国普通老百姓的生活史。剧集改编自梁晓声同名小说，电视剧版汇聚了强大的阵容。由曾执导过《人民的名义》的李路导演，旁白由陈道明担任，主演则有雷佳音、辛柏青、宋佳等演技派的演员。在时…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这并不是微软所承诺的……但也不全是坏事。




2007 年 1 月 30 日，也就是 15 年前，一再延期的 Windows Vista 发布了。

我们可以尽情地谈论 Vista 有多糟糕、人们有多讨厌它。它是有史以来最不受欢迎的版本之一，与 Windows ME 一样。但是，你今天运行的随便哪个现代 Windows，它都是 Vista 的后裔。

Vista 并没有微软像 2000 年承诺的那样，Windows “Whistler” 将合并 Windows 9x 和 Windows NT：这变成了 XP，每个人都记得 XP —— 基本上都是怀念。Windows Blackcomb 是 XP 的计划中的继任者。它从未面世。我们得到的是 Windows Longhorn。

Blackcomb 将有一个新的编程模型、一个新的用户界面，以及一个新的数据库驱动的存储引擎，“WinFS”……但它被延期了，然后被删除，最后被取消。

谈论 Vista 到底是什么更有意思。摆上货架的是技术上更保守的东西。

它有用户访问控制（UAC）：那些恼人的弹出式信息不断要求获得你的许可。（这实际上是微软意识到大部分的 Windows 机器都是独立的，没有连接到域。）

它有一个 3D 合成的用户界面，“Aero”，带有透明效果，尽管这确实使它变得有点慢。而当 Windows 7 推出时，人们很喜欢它 —— 所以微软将它从 Windows 8 中剥离了。（指的是外观，而不是合成过程；那仍然存在）。

它有一个包含“小部件”的侧边栏，这在 Windows 11 中又出现了。

尽管它在五年前就被干掉了，但 Vista 是 Windows 7 的基础。Vista 是 NT 的第 6 版；而 Windows 7 则是 Windows NT 6.1。

Windows 7 是经过调整的 Vista，响应速度更快。Windows 8 则是 Vista 2：是 Vista 的平板电脑版（它实际上相当不错）。

困难在于，人们已经习惯了台式机和鼠标，所以开始按钮又被迅速恢复了。Windows 8.1 则是 Vista 2.1。

Windows 10 是 Vista 3，Metro 现代应用程序被搁置，桌面应用程序再次成为中心。现在，Windows 11 删除了所有那些讨厌的、复杂的、混乱的东西，如垂直侧边栏。

Vista 是微软放弃其花哨的技术野心而开始简化事物的时候。现在有远见的人已经离开了。Surface 并没有彻底改变这个行业，它只是疏远了 OEM 厂商。

15 年过去了，微软仍在对 Vista 进行迭代。

数据类
与Java等语言不同，kotlin创建只包含数据的类时，需要在类名前声明关键字：data。
data class KotlinBean (val brand : String)

在kotlin中，编译器会自动的从主构造函数中根据所有声明的属性提取以下函数：
· equals()
· hashCode()
· toString()
· componentN() functions (对应于属性，按声明顺序排列)
· copy()
如果这些函数已经在类中被明确定义了，或者从超类中继承而来，就不再会生成。不是所有的kotlin类都能声明为数据类，一般数据类声明都要满足以下条件：
· 主构造函数至少包含一个或多个参数；
· 所有的主构造函数的参数必须标识为val或var；
· 数据类不可声明为abstract，open，sealed或者inner；
· 数据类不能继承其他类(但是可以实现接口)。
Copy()
望词生意，此方法作用就是复制，我们可以使用该函数复制对象并修改部分属性，比如对于上面的KotlinBean类，实现类似下面示例：
fun copy(brand: String = this.brand) = KotlinBean(brand)

需要修改数据类的属性时用copy()，示例：
data class KotlinBean (val brand : String)

fun main(args: Array) {
    val jack = KotlinBean(brand = "Jack")
    val olderJack = jack.copy(brand = "olderJack")
    println(jack)
    println(olderJack)…]]></summary>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第9天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。

📢前言

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第69天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：赎金信
给定一个赎金信 (ransom) 字符串和一个杂志(magazine)字符串，判断第一个字符串 ransom 能不能由第二个字符串 magazines 里面的字符构成。如果可以构成，返回 true ；否则返回 false。
(题目说明：为了不暴露赎金信字迹，要从杂志上搜索各个需要的字母，组成单词来表达意思。杂志字符串中的每个字符只能在赎金信字符串中使用一次。)
示例1:
输入：ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
输出：false

示例2:
输入：ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
输出：false

示例 3：
输入：ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
输出：true

提示：
你可以假设两个字符串均只含有小写字母。
🌻C#方法：数组存储
利用数组储存字母出现次数，然后进行比较即可得出结果！
代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool CanConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        int[] alphabets = new int[26];
        char[] m = magazine.ToCharArray(), r = ransomNote.ToCharArray();
        foreach (char c in m) {
            alphabets[c - 'a']++;
        }
        foreach (char c in r) {
            if (alphabets[c - 'a'] != 0) alphabets[c - 'a']--;
            else return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：76 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了79.50%的用户
内存消耗：42.4 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了5.50%的用户

🌻Java 方法：数组存储
思路解析
使用a和b两个数组分别存储ransomNote和magazine每个字符出现的次数，
如果a里面每个字符出现的次数都小于等于b里面的
则判断为true，如果有一个大于b的则返回false
这样就可以完成需求啦！
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        int[] a = new int[26];
        int[] b = new int[26];
        char[] aChar = ransomNote.toCharArray();
        char[] bChar = magazine.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i  b[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

执行结果
通过
执行用时：1 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了90.26%的用户
内存消耗：45.2 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了8.05%的用户

💬总结
今天是力扣算法题打卡的第六十九天！
文章采用 C# 和 Java 两种编程语言进行解题
一些方法也是参考力扣大神写的，也是边学习边分享，再次感谢算法大佬们
那今天的算法题分享到此结束啦，明天再见！]]></summary>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

10 分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
「和危险的动物接触」之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需…]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-14240-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14240-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-02-04T02:39:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是离线学习和新的教育应用程序，为学校和学生提供帮助。




Zorin OS 16 是 2021 年最令人印象深刻的发行版之一。你或许想先了解一下 Zorin OS 16 和 Zorin OS 16 精简版 的信息。

现在，经过一段时间，Zorin OS 团队终于决定发布 Zorin OS 16 教育版。

可以预期包含 Zorin OS 16 的所有改进，以及为教育而量身定做的具体修改。

请注意，教育版的 Zorin OS 16 是完全免费下载的。对于旧电脑，你还可以使用精简教育版。

Zorin OS 16 教育版有什么新内容？

Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是以离线为先的学习体验。换句话说，它包括一个合格的教育内容集，不需要上网就可以访问。

为了实现这一目标，Zorin OS 16 包括了 Kolibri，这是一个自由开源的教育解决方案，支持自定进度的学习，并通过本地 Wi-Fi 网络进行同步/共享。

因此，即使没有互联网，你也可以依靠点对点的连接来分享教育内容，进行协作，并继续学习，不受任何干扰。

学校管理者还可以创建自己的课程，并从可汗学院、Open Stax、麻省理工学院等来源下载现成的资源。

当然，管理员需要互联网接入才能做到这一点。但是，一旦你下载了内容，就可以在没有互联网接入的情况下轻松地在本地网络上分享，从而使分发教育内容成为可能。

除了 Kolibri 之外，Zorin OS 16 还出炉了新的教育应用程序，其中一些是：

Minder：将想法和笔记可视化



与 Obsidian 和 Logseq 类似，Minder 是一个更简单有效的思维导图工具，帮助你将笔记和想法可视化，而进行头脑风暴会议。

Foliate：电子书阅读器



Foliate 是一个令人印象深刻的 Linux 电子书阅读器应用。它应该能让学生/教师提高阅读体验，也能在需要时提供公共领域书籍的下载。

OpenBoard：交互式白板



我最近报道了 OpenBoard，作为我们的应用亮点之一。它是一个自由开源的白板，应该会让老师和学生也感到有趣。

OpenBoard 应该有助于通过工具以及应用程序与多媒体内容互动的能力来改善学习过程。

Minuet：音乐教学

Minuet 专注于帮助你向学生教授音乐。你会发现视觉队列，以及和弦、音阶等方面的练耳练习。

其他改进措施

根据你的系统配置，可以选择 Zorin OS 16 教育版或 Zorin OS 16 精简教育版。

这两个教育版应该会带来更快、更漂亮的桌面体验，可以访问更多的应用程序。

Zorin OS 16 教育版支持到 2025 年 4 月。

你可以从其官方网站下载 Zorin OS 16 教育版及其精简版。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


In HTML, if you want a textbox with some initial text you wrap text inside the textarea tag like this <textarea> Hello World </textarea>, this is fully editable, but if you try this in react you will get an error. Trying to use the defaultValue prop in react won't work either. if you add a value prop to the textarea the value of the text will be displayed but then it won't be editable, this is because the value prop is immutable.
Passing a value prop to textarea like this <textarea value={'Hello World'}> </textarea>, will display the text Hello World on the textbox, but it won't be editable to make it editable we need to pass the a state to the value prop and update that state with the onChange prop like the code below.
import { useState } from 'react';

function TextBox () {

    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello World');

   return (
           <textarea 
             value={text} 
             onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) }>
          </textarea>
         );

}

export default TextBox;


Inside the TextBox component, I initialize the text state with 'Hello World' and passed it to the textarea as a value prop, this will be the initial text displayed in the text area. onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) } this line of code updates the text state, with the new value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。
但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。

一、带宽进化的历史
我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。
56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。

我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。
后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。
21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。

ADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。
2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。

从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。
二、家庭的入户带宽
现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[let count = 0;
console.log(count++)


....it's...

0


 
The pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increment (or decrement) their operand by 1, and the value of the expression is the resulting incremented (or decremented) value.
Let's look at what's going on "under the hood".
Here is a representation using a JavaScript class object.
postAdd = {count++}
class Counter {
  constructor (){
    this.count = 0
  }
  postAdd(){
    let oldCount = this.count;
    this.count+=1;
    return oldCount
  }
  preAdd(){
    this.count += 1;
    return this.count
  }
}

let count = new Counter();

console.log(count.postAdd()) // 0

console.log(count.preAdd()) // 2 (the first console.log still increments!!!)


{variable}++ can be used when you don't reference the increased variable in that function call and ++{variable} is useful when you need to reference the incremented variable immediately. -Zach Stone
Technically, pre incrementent is also faster since it is not creating a new variable each time.
I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below.

Have a fantastic day!]]></summary>

They are three types of methods in python:
Instance method
Class methed
Static method
Instance method is the most comman type of method used in python class. To call an instance method, you need to create an object of the class and with the help of that object you can access instance method.
On other hand, both class method and static method can be accessed directly by using class name i.e without creating object of class. Though you can also access these methods using object of a class.
Class and Static methods have some basic differences. Let's have a look over the difference between class and static method.

前言
电子邮件(email）是一种传统的互联网沟通和交流方式，目前仍在办公场所广泛使用。最近在负责一款邮件客户端APP的开发工作，接触到了一些邮件相关的代码和知识，抽时间就整理了一下邮件开发相关的开源库和资源。
正文
首先明确一下，邮箱从使用协议/类别上大致可以分为两种：
标准的IMAP/SMTP邮箱，如GMail、Outlook、Yahoo、QQ、163等邮箱。
Exchange，即Microsoft Exchange Server，是微软公司推出的邮件服务器，如Exchange 2010。应用程序可以使用EWS(Exchange Web Service)来访问Exchange服务器上的邮件、日程、联系人等。
mailcore2
MailCore2是一个用C语言编写的邮件协议封装库，能够运行在iOS、Android、Mac、Windows和Linux平台上，支持SMTP、IMAP、POP3、MIME和HTML消息渲染。MailCore2 API的调用都是异步的，即操作都在子线程中进行，不会阻塞当前主线程。
MailCore 2 provide a simple and asynchronous API to work with e-mail protocols IMAP, POP and SMTP. The API has been redesigned from ground up.
GitHub:
https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2
很多第三方邮件客户端收发邮件都是基于MailCore2开发的，如小巧精致，超高颜值的开源项目Mailspring

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using a websocket server is a great way to speed up your applications. APIs inherently come with their own HTTP overhead, which means every time you call an API, you have to wait a little bit for the HTTP response.
This is mostly fine, but if you have an application with a lot of time sensitive and frequent server requests, it can become a problem. A good example of this is a chat app, where you need to see what the other person is saying immediately. APIs can still work in this scenario, but it's not the best solution for the job.
In this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up a websocket server in Vue.JS, using a websocket server built in Node.JS and express. Keep reading for more. I've also written another tutorial on how to create a websocket server in Express and Javascript here.…]]></summary>

VCS is short for Version control system, it is a Version management system that tracks changes in files along with the order in which the changes to these files were made.

Git is an example of a Version control system (VCS), it allows you track all versions of your work and stored as repositories or repos for short. Github is different from Git, but since they are used side by side it is often confused for Git. Github is more like a shared hosting platform for all repositories and applies Git for effective collaboration within organizations and developers.

This is part of the UI Kit with React, TypeScript, Storybook and Tailwind, make sure you've checked out the previous entries in the series if you find anything confusing 😊.
In this series I aim to implement a basic text field and integrate it with Storybook.
Let's start off by creating what's necessary for the text field. I want my text field to support the basics of a simple text-input field. It should support being disabled, having a placeholder and so on. On top of that I want it to integrate with react-hook-form as that is one of my favorite form libraries for React.
In the end, I want it to look like this:

In the project, create the files:

In a nutshell, startTransition is a new API in React 18 that's going to allow us to keep our applications interactive and responsive, even while big updates are happening behind the scenes. Previously, if a user was to initiate an action that would trigger a component to update – such as a search that fetches a ton of new data to display – the whole page would just kind of hang while all that loading stuff was happening. This, as you can imagine, feels kind of awkward to users, so as developers we were forced to find other ways around it – skeleton UIs to make loads feel faster, debouncing, setTimeouts, etc. 
In React, all updates are rendered equally urgently – o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: This is the first part of a 3 part series in which we'll understand the transform property of CSS.
In this part, we'll understand the value 'rotate' of the transform property.
The transform property is most commonly used in animations as it allows us to do a ton of things such as moving an element, scaling it, rotating it etc.
There are 5 types of "rotate" in the transform property:
1. transform: rotate();
2. transform: rotateX();
3. transform: rotateY();
4. transform: rotateZ();
5. transform: rotate3d;

Let's understand them one by one by applying these values on the below👇code:

今天 Dart  2.16 跟随 Flutter 2.10 正式发布，它不包含新的语言特性，但有一堆错误修复（包括对安全漏洞的修复），改进了 Dart 包在特定平台的支持，以及 pub.dev 的全新搜索体验。
Dart 2.16
今天与 Flutter 2.10 一起发布的 Dart 2.16 SDK 继续从传统的 Dart CLI 工具（dartfmt、dartdoc 等）过渡到新的组合 dart 开发工具，新的弃用工具是 dartdoc( use dart doc) 和 dartanalyzer (use dart analyze)。
在 Dart 2.17 中我们计划完全删除 dartdoc、dartanalyzer 和 pub 命令（在 Dart 2.15 中已弃用；使用 dart pub 或者 flutter pub）。有关详细信息请参阅#46100。
2.16 版本还包括了一个安全漏洞的修复和两个小的重大更改：
dart:io  中的 HttpClient API  允许为 authorization、www-authenticate、cookie 和 cookie2 设置可选标头，Dart 2.16 之前的 SDK 中重定向逻辑的实现存在一个漏洞，当跨域重定向发生时，这些 headers（可能包含敏感信息）会被传递，在 Dart 2.16 中这些 headers 被删除了。
dart:io 中的 Directory.rename API 已更改了在 Windows 上的行为：它不再删除与目标名称匹配的现有目录（#47653）。

自从推出 Flutter 以来，我们一直专注于为漂亮的定制应用提供跨平台解决方案，这些应用被编译为机器代码并充分利用设备的底层图形硬件功能。
今天这一愿景有了新的重大突破，第一个支持 Windows 的版本发布了。

目前有近 50 万个应用程序正在使用 Flutter……
到目前为止，我们已经看到了超出我们预期的势头，现已有近 50 万个已经发布的应用使用了 Flutter，其中包括来自 Betterment、BMW 和 ByteDance 等公司的大型应用程序，以及来自 Google 三十个团队所开发的应用。
Statista和SlashData等分析师衡量，2021 年 Flutter 已经成为最受欢迎的跨平台 UI 工具包：

在 2021 年的所有四个季度调查中，始终有92% 的 Flutter 开发人员对我们的工具表示积极满意。（对于另外 8% 的人，我们正在倾听你的反馈）
在调研数据中一个常见的请求就是对 Windows 的支持。
今天，我们很高兴地宣布在稳定版本中全面支持 Windows 应用。
Window and Flutter
几年前我们为 Flutter 制定了一个雄心勃勃的愿景，即从 iOS 和 Android 上的移动应用扩展到括 Web 和 Desktop 平台。
Flutter 跨平台的核心是：便携、 Skia 图形引擎、Flutter 渲染系统、动画、主题、文本输入和国际化以及 Flutter 提供的数百个控件 。
但桌面应用不仅仅是在更大屏幕上运行的移动应用：
它还有专用的输入设备，例如键盘和鼠标，并且有可调整大小的窗口，通常在宽屏显示器上运；

欢迎来到 Flutter 2.10 稳定版本的更新，自上次发布至今还不到两个月，但即使在这么短的时间内，Flutter 2.10 也关闭了 1,843 个 issues，合并了来自全球 155 位贡献者的 1,525 个 PR，所以非常感谢大家这段时间出色的工作，尤其是在 2021 年假期期间。
作为此版本的重要组成部分，这里有几件令人兴奋的事情要宣布，包括：
Flutter 对 Windows 支持的重大更新；
一些关于性能方面的重大改进；
关于对框架中图标和颜色相关的新功能支持；
一些开发工具方便的改进；
此外还有一些关于移除 dev channel 的更新、减少对旧版 iOS 的支持以及简短的重要变更列表等等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI 参加编程竞赛，成绩超过了一半的程序员

DeepMind 刚刚宣布了其最新打造的 AlphaCode 编程 AI。它参加了 Codeforces 的编程挑战，这是一个极具挑战性的编程平台，通过类似于国际象棋的 Elo 评级系统来分享每周问题和相关排名。最终 AlphaCode 针对 Codeforces 网站上 5000 名用户解决的十个挑战项目开展了测试，且拿下了平均名次位于前 54.3% 的成绩。DeepMind 估计该系统的 Codeforces Elo 为 1238，位居过去 6 个月在该网站上发起挑战的用户榜单的前 28% 。


老王点评：看来至少有一半的程序员可以考虑改行了。




树莓派操作系统发布 64 位版本

虽然 2016 年发布的树莓派 3 及后来的产品已经带有 64 位 CPU，甚至树莓派 Zero 2 也具有 64 位功能，但官方提供的树莓派操作系统一直是 32 位的。不过，64 位的操作系统可以支持更多内存，较新的指令集也有性能优势，此外，一些基于 Arm 的商业/二进制分发软件只支持 AArch64，因此树莓派基金会决定提供 64 位的树莓派操作系统。


老王点评：终于升级到 64 位了，虽然之前可以使用其他的 64 位操作系统。




Oracle Linux 出现在 Windows 商店

Oracle Linux 8.5 是 CentOS 8.5 的衍生发行版，以 WSL 的形式出现在 Windows 商店，这是红帽家族的发行版 首次 出现在 Windows 商店，尽管 Oracle Linux 不是红帽的。在 Windows 商店中，如果你搜索 Linux，你会发现 Ubuntu、SUSE/openSUSE、Debian、Kali、Alpine 等等，这都是为 WSL 开发的。但你不会看到 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL 之类的红帽系的 Linux，虽然有人为 WSL 中制作了 Fedora remix。


老王点评：我就说 Oracle Linux 是叛徒，对吧。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天是大年初三，第四集，先给大家拜个年。
几集播完，引发的一波波舆论有我们想到的、没想到的，千言万语化作一句话“咱老李啥时候有过这热度？”也许是我们一路来收到太多关于老李的负面言论，这么一下子我们都有些不适应。不过还请珍惜雪儿的独角戏。
另一方面从我个人而言，受邀来此只为了和大家分享，我会很认真的对待，有些评论虽然言语激烈但是说的在理，忠言逆耳再难听也得听着，听完还得寻思寻思，反手再说句谢谢。但对于那些只为发泄的言论，只能表示理解。
回归正题！先给大家放几张图。

当时我们寻思疗伤这事儿咋样能好玩有看点，又不能太肆意妄为，因为事儿赶着事儿，不能太放纵喽。所以感谢舒导啊，强烈建议美人出浴搞点福利，并带着我反复研究学习女神塞隆著名的某广告，最终成功被删减，不过万幸，没有全部删掉。

这些则是最后一场戏的删减，其实还好，只是删了特写和全景中尸体的数量，无非是最后的冲击力少了些。但难受的是我们“有始有终”的巴也，他的死亡特写删掉替换成破损的单钺，我怕有人误会他跑了，其实没有，他走了，还走得特别不安详doge，他的死状请记住，死的方式很有特点，会是谁的功法呢~
再说说最后一场戏巴也率人追来，不知道大家觉得压迫感如何，那场戏的气氛灵感来自英剧《浴血黑帮》，几个身着黑衣面容阴郁的挺拔男子，伴随着身后工厂的滚滚蒸汽大步行来，让我备受震撼。



再有个有意思的就是，姬如雪被巴也一脚跺晕，一开始踩的是肚子，但总感觉从构图到反应都不够冲击力，于是略作调整后，看到这里的同事无不以“卧槽”开头，尤其是磊哥，“卧槽！这TM都踩胸上了！”巴也这脚踩的有多狠，他后面走的就有多刺激。
最后再跟大家唠唠这一集最精彩的段落，姬如雪的“鸿门宴”。
不知道有没有小伙伴看过上映前，有一个叫“兖州大殿”的场景PV。那里面都是我们一开始的设想，偌大的破败古庙，两侧监国锦衣持刀而立，行注目礼，压力直给。那是美好的设想，压迫感是来了，但最后要是无双也太没意思（其实就是人多拍不起）。于是我们加入了巴也四徒（四人面具是喜怒哀乐，有看出来的嘛），设计了一场3D立体打姬。
运镜、动作编排这些就不细说了，好不好观众评判，这次从耳朵出发——音效和音乐。
首先音效，这场戏是多人混战，同时武器驳杂调度也大，特别适合作为例子来聊。在那个追着我要头发的音效师那里是第一步……

我们需要把细节、比例、大小、方向全部处理好，好的音效就是让你注意不到，同画面永远是一体的，是最真实的表达。但是当离开录音棚，离开拥有高解析和声场的监听级设备，很多东西就会被捏在一起，不是每个人都有好几千的耳机或音响设备去体验的，所以就来到了最后一步，就是我需要带上一个平价的耳机同时使用电脑自带的音响，再处理一遍音效。主要处理声音的重点，尽量保留细节同时把距离感和力度突出来，这种处理方式会有损音效本身的精度，但会让大部分设备都能更直接感受到我们所想表达的内容。放假走的匆匆，没拍照，有机会给大家看看剪辑软件上音轨的调整画面~
音乐也是同理，甚至更甚，毛大师那边就会用好几种喇叭模拟各种设备的效果，当然架不住坏的啊。记得刚播出那天，模型有个小姑娘看完输出的mov，跑过来慌慌张张告诉我
“李导李导，OP的声音有问题呀，念白听不清楚啊。”
我都惊了，急匆匆赶去拿起她的耳机，她告诉我
“导儿，用左耳，右耳是坏的”
我好像意识到什么，但还是拿起左耳带上，传出的声音就跟把你裹着被子沉海里一样，左边的解析一样有问题。所以啊，咱们有条件我强烈推荐戴耳机观看，稍稍在意一下自己的体感，求求了~
接着音乐部分，这一集可真是把我纠结死了，为姬如雪单独写了首《巾帼》，如果看到片尾的小伙伴可能会发现，片尾的曲子与姬如雪独战是一个旋律，它们都是《巾帼》。最终通过版其实是片尾这一首，从姬如雪拄剑站起，拔出匕首，大家可以试试把这个音乐贴上去，递进感更强更燃更合适，但问题是！音乐中的两次高潮，旋律是一样的，从姬如雪撞断柱子“而是，让他带我走！”这里开始，本想所有动效都摘掉，全靠音乐炸起来，结果，结果就是没炸起来……

当时我意识到，这种问题给毛大师淦碎了也没用，周期不等人，所有环节继续，到最终定剪时，我一咬牙，决定取上一版Demo的前半段保留最终版的后半段，在旋律上做些区别，音效也配合垫上一些，尽可能加大前后落差以增强冲击力。我都做好前面直接用Demo的准备了，毛大师知道后，赶在交片前重新录制调整，才有了两首不一样的《巾帼》，感谢毛亮老师，你简直是我们的HERO！
这些问题都是不到最后感觉不到的，突发状况，最后将进击版《巾帼》放在片尾我觉得还挺酷的，本来这集是要放原点的嘿嘿，再等等，下一集更合适！

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

2022 年 2 月 4 日，「新冠疫情爆发后首届如期举办的奥运会」——北京 2022 年冬奥会（大名：「第 24 届冬季奥林匹克运动会」英文「XXIV Olympics Winter Games Beijing 2022」，简称「北京冬奥会」）在「鸟巢」（国家体育场）正式拉开帷幕。春节期间，应该也有不少读者通过电视和网络直播「围观」过开幕式和国家体育场主火炬塔点燃的瞬间。
为了帮助你更好地观看北京冬奥会的比赛，这份包含观赛平台、赛程表等的冬奥观赛补给包特地为你准备好，为你的冬奥观赛助一臂之力。
这届冬奥会到底在哪里举办？
虽说是「北京冬奥会」，但实际上是由北京市联手河北省张家口市，由北京赛区、延庆赛区和张家口赛区共三个赛区共同举办 。北京赛区主管速度滑冰、短道速滑、冰壶、冰球、花样滑冰等冰上项目以及单板和自由式滑雪大跳台等雪上项目；延庆赛区举办高山滑雪、雪橇、雪车和钢架雪车四个分项；张家口赛区则承办冬季两项、越野滑雪等雪上项目。
你知道上面的小图标代表哪些场馆吗？
闭环管理是啥？
由于疫情原因，北京冬奥组委决定对运动员、随队官员和其他利益方人员（包括志愿者、记者等）进行闭环管理。闭环管理就是境外来华的人员，从入境进入海关后开始体温筛查，经过核酸采样，然后直接通过专用的交通工具送到奥运村或签约酒店。每个奥运村和签约酒店，都是一个独立的闭环。从入境到抵离，交通、餐饮、住宿、训练、比赛，包括媒体的采访，形成了多个闭环点，通过交通工具在这些闭环点连线移动进行活动和工作，就是一个完整的闭环。这样做可以有效避免闭环外人员被可能的病例感染。

在微软去年的 Surface 新品发布会之后，就一直对这个号称「环保」、由海洋回收塑料瓶制成的树脂材料蓝色鼠标印象深刻。去年年底终于得偿所愿，入手了这款微软海洋环保鼠标。

撇开同样被微软设计成为方便残障人士开启的环保鼠标包装盒（暂且先不考虑残障人士会不会买这款鼠标），就鼠标本身来讲，微软海洋环保鼠标其实是让我非常失望的：首先就是堪称渲染图诈骗的实际鼠标颜色：实际观感鼠标更加淡灰色，黑色颗粒也会更加明显（但手感上没有区别）。

上面就是官方渲染图 & 实际颜色效果（我已经将室内光源调整至最冷的模式，仍然比官方渲染图中那个洁白无瑕的颜色深了不少）。以至于在上手这款鼠标之后有朋友嘲笑：「你的鼠标是买洗衣粉送的吗？」，我的第一反应其实是「这个形容太准确了！」。

这款鼠标的手感更不值一提：鼠标本身很小巧，重量适中，如果你的手掌像我一样足够大的话可以手本身不移动就覆盖到整片屏幕操作，不过鼠标材质本身质感基本于一般廉价塑料鼠标无异，如果它的配色是纯黑色我的心理预期价位可能只有 ¥50。

所以不要期待太多：它的质感很廉价，闪闪放光芒的指示灯让我梦回初中电脑机房的双飞燕，手感当然也无从谈起，不能调节 DPI、没有辅助功能按键，它只是一个用普通 AAA 电池供电的普通小鼠标而已。
就是这样，即使价格已经很低（当然是相对于微软自家其他外设而言），但综合体验下来，微软海洋环保鼠标的体验大概是其他品牌百元价位鼠标的体验。真要说优势的话，大概还是它的设计我仍然很中意：这也…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nitrux 2.0.0 是一个令人兴奋的版本，它默认采用 XanMod 内核，并 带来了其他各种视觉和技术改进。




Nitrux Linux 轻松成为了 最漂亮的 Linux 发行版 之一。

上个月，我们点评了 Maui Shell，它也是由 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队所设计的。现在，Nitrux 2.0.0 已经发布，并带来了一些令人兴奋的变化。

让我在这里重点介绍一下基本变化。

Nitrux 2.0.0 有什么新东西？

这次升级包括一个新的 Linux 内核、更新的应用程序、桌面环境、固件改进，以及大大减小了 ISO 的大小。

你还会注意到布局和顶部面板等几处细微视觉变化。

XanMod 内核 5.16.3



XanMod 内核是为新一代硬件量身定做的，以获得尽可能好的桌面体验。

与许多其他 Linux 发行版中自带的 Linux 内核相比，你会发现它有一些自定义设置和新功能，可以提高你的使用体验。

在 Nitrux 2.0.0 中，默认选择了 XanMod 内核 5.16.3。当然你仍然可以选择最新的主线 LTS 或非 LTS（5.15.17、5.16.3）Linux 内核。

别忘了，如果你需要，你还可以安装 Liquorix 和 Libre 内核。

更新布局和面板的变化

顶部面板现在显示了窗口控制、标题、全局菜单和系统托盘区。

布局仍然与以前的版本相似，但有一些位置的调整，比如将应用程序菜单添加到基座dock中，应用程序菜单是 Launchpad Plasma（感谢 adhe）。



此外，你应会发现窗口装饰有了改进，所有窗口现在默认都是无边框的。你可以在外观设置下的窗口装饰选项中选择禁用无边框窗口模式。

可选的 Latte 布局也得到了更新，包括窗口控制、标题栏和全局菜单。

更新的软件包和驱动程序

出于显而易见的原因，这次升级包括 KDE Plasma 版本更新、KDE 框架、KDE 装备，以及其他必要的应用程序，如 Firefox 和 LibreOffice。

此外，为 AMD GPU 增加了内核软件包中没有的额外固件。他们还在可下载的 ISO 中增加了 i915、Nouveau 和 AMDGPU 驱动。

默认使用的是 MESA 21.3.5 稳定版，但如果你需要的话，可以安装最新的 MESA 22.0。

其他改进

在 Nitrux Linux 的这些变化之外，还有一些额外的技术改进，如：


减少了标准版和精简版的 ISO 文件大小。

Xbox One 控制器的工作原理与操纵杆没有冲突。

在精简版 ISO 中，JWM 取代了 i3 窗口管理器。


更多细节，你可以参考 官方公告。

介绍
App Startup是一个可以用于加速App启动速度的一个库。
出现的原因
以前初始化第三方库会在Application的onCreate中。
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        LitePal.initialize(this)
        AAA.initialize(this)
        BBB.initialize(this)
        CCC.initialize(this)
DDD.initialize(this)
EEE.initialize(this)
    }
    ...
}

现在越来越多的库在ontentProvider来初始化。
class MyProvider : ContentProvider() {

    override fun onCreate(): Boolean {
        context?.let {
            LitePal.initialize(it)
        }
        return true
    }
    ...
}



这样写逻辑不会有什么问题。
但是ContentProvider越来越多，启动就慢了。
关于ContentProvider的耗时，Google官方也有给出一个测试结果：

原理
把这些库放置到一个ContentProvider。
以前：

现在：

使用
引入App Startup。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[好像，「XX 是一种生活方式」这样的句型要被用烂了。但是我实在想不到一个更好的方法去总结我接下来要写出来的这篇文章。毕竟，在少数派的写作本身，就是我生活的一部分，而我的生活方式中的确有不少成分是围绕写作这个目的去展开的。尽管我不是职业作家（天哪，我觉得如果我有那个自律的能力的话，我很想成为一名自由撰稿人），但是写作已经超越了爱好的范畴 —— 所以我只好把它定义为生活方式。
去年年底，我恰好迷上了美剧《Sex and the City》。这部美剧以 Carrie Bradshaw，纽约一家报纸的专栏作家，书写她自己和朋友们的罗曼史，作为展开的方式。当然了，这部美剧以其开放大胆的镜头著称，但是我却总是为主角 Carrie 写作的方式（时间、地点）而着迷：有的时候她是在窗边，看着对面的一对情侣做着不可描述的事情；有的时候是坐在床上，点着一根烟，开始冥想；有的时候是因为受不了公寓的拥挤不堪，出门去咖啡馆看着来来往往的人群 —— 或许正是这份写作时无拘无束的自由，让我最为渴望吧。
Carrie 和她的 PowerBook G3
阅读是写作的开始
获取信息可能是输出信息的第一步 —— 我反正是这么觉得。自由的写作本身就来自大量的泛读，怪不得人们常说「天下文章一大抄」。套路都摆在那里，写作的时候留心借鉴，的确是事半功倍的。
我的阅读来源其实还算不上太「广泛」，只有一些会经常关注的媒体 / up / YouTuber，作为信息来源我个人认为已经足够，同时也不会每天感到信息过载。由于个人感兴趣的点主要集中在科技 / 数码方面，关注的媒体网站也大多数在此列。
YouTuber / B 站 up
现在是一个视频的时代，对吧？所以免不了的，我也关注了一些 YouTuber 和 B 站 up，主要也是有关科技的。关注视频类的账号，其实主要是因为有些时候看文字测评很容易睡着，视频其实从形式上有趣、直接…]]></summary>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第16天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
2022年打算从零开发一款浏览器，名字还没想好。
既然是浏览器，按照国际按理先实现一个多窗口的功能
我打算用ViewPager+Fragment来实现，但仔细想想，这样缺点是十分明显因为要保证Fragment不销毁重建，当viewpager的fragment个数过多，会造成很明显的卡顿，所以先用FragmentManager试试效果
多窗口中，每一个窗口都有自己的返回栈

/**
 * @author huangweiliang
 */
class NavHostFragment(var name: String, var windowIndex: Int): Fragment() {
    private lateinit var binding: FragmentNavHostBinding
    private val TAG: String = "NavHostFragment"
    var curSelectFragment: Fragment? = null
    var curChildFragmentManager: FragmentManager? = null

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[序言
我一直觉得，要用一篇几千字的文章来概括自己在一年里做了什么是一件非常困难的事情，出于自己的文笔和对文字的把控能力，我只能挑选自己觉得最重要且时间较长的事情展开说说。
2021 年 1 月，我在 Alva 的「怂恿」下成为了我派的一员，开始尝试用文字在少数派里和朋友们分享自己在「摄影」这个「无底洞」里面的收获的心得和教训。
8 月份，我告别家人，来到香港继续学业。
作为一个从小看着 TVB 电视剧长大的广州人，在香港其实并没有感受到多少「独在异乡」的感觉。虽说如此，在我在香港生活的这段时间里，也确实遇到了一些让我感到疑惑、生气和愤怒的人和事。也许这就是香港这座城市本来的样子吧。香港很小，只有广州的七分之一，长沙的十分之一。但是它又足够大，我可以在里面找到熟悉和亲切的感觉，感受到善意和温暖，也能够遇到敌意和冷漠。
乌溪沙海滩
在香港这半年里，我发现其实能带着相机出去的时间并不多（虽然已经尽量尝试多带出去了），一方面是因为我懒，哪怕现在的无反相机已经很轻了，但是带出去还是需要进行一点心理建设；另一方面是因为学习比较繁重，也没很多大段完整的时间外出拍摄。所以，我很多时候就是靠着随身的手机拍摄，很多图片都是我看到在路上发现的风景抬手拍摄而成的。
在动笔开始写这篇年度总结之前，我特地看了一下之前用手机拍摄的照片，很惊讶地发现原来自己已经走过了这么多的地方：从上水到浅水湾、从天水围到油塘、从坚尼地城到杏花村。我很欣慰，因为虽然感觉自己很懒，但是从来没有放弃用脚去过丈量这片土地。现在是一月中下旬，因为香港「遍地开花」的疫情，距离下一次的痛快出游显得遥遥无期。所以，我谨以这篇文章记录一下这半年内我所看到的香江风情。

器材、拍摄方式和后期处理

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英特尔为 Linux 开发“软件定义芯片”功能

去年 9 月以来，英特尔一直在正在开发一个允许激活特定 CPU 功能的 Linux 内核驱动，这让人想起十年前的英特尔升级服务，它可以通过软件在某些酷睿 CPU 上激活特定功能。这个 功能 允许通过驱动程序和加密许可证，在特定的 CPU 上单独购买并激活特定的功能。但是英特尔并没有披露他们计划使用该驱动在未来的 CPU 上提供什么样的功能。


老王点评：可能有些人不知道，你购买的芯片中的某些电路其实没有工作的，而通过这个功能，以后就可以有选择性地付钱激活使用了。




黑莓以 6 亿美元出售其移动和信息专利

黑莓将这些围绕黑莓手机、QWERTY 键盘和黑莓信使（BBM）的 专利出售 给一家名为 Catapult 的新公司。在 2018 年黑莓曾将这些专利作为武器来对付 Facebook Messenger。有意思的是，这 6 亿美元的交易提供的资金中有 1.5 亿美元是期票。也就是说这家新公司，有大量的债务，没有产品，也没有现金流。这大概意味着起诉所有它认为侵犯了其新收购的专利资产的公司。


老王点评：没料到黑莓最后所剩不多的遗产居然是专利索赔。




OpenSSF 启动 Alpha-Omega 项目

该项目 已经获得了 500 万美元的启动资金，并得到了包括微软、谷歌等的支持。Alpha-Omega 将系统地寻找开源代码中尚未发现的新漏洞，然后与项目维护者合作，使其得到修复，来提升全球开源软件供应链的安全性。该项目中的 “Alpha” 代表将帮助最关键的开源项目（包括独立项目和核心生态系统服务）的维护者识别和修复安全漏洞。而 “Omega” 则确定至少 10,000 个广泛部署的开源软件项目，将自动安全分析、评分和补救指导等应用于其维护者社区。


老王点评：看起来近来几次开源供应链的事故让业界行动起来了，希望能见到实际的效果。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[它不是每个人的理想选择，但作为一个 Linux 爱好者，我喜欢用它做实验。




当 Pine64 在 2019 年发布 PinePhone 时，没有人能够预见它将对移动 Linux、桌面 Linux 和隐私产生巨大的影响。

作为 少数专为运行桌面 Linux 而设计的手机 之一，它具有低端安卓手机的所有功能，同时又具有笔记本电脑的多功能性。不幸的是，桌面 Linux 就是这样：它是为台式机设计的，而不是为手机设计的。

幸运的是，由于 GNOME、KDE、Pine64 和众多 Linux 社区的惊人力量，全新的桌面环境、应用程序和发行版应运而生。其中一些比较知名的包括 Plasma Mobile、Phosh、Megapixels 和Mobian。

有了这些所有关键的部分，Pine64 需要做的就是销售 PinePhone，他们确实也卖出了 PinePhone。每一轮社区版（每个都预装了不同的发行版）的预购都收到了数千份订单，其中之一就是我的。

自从我在 2020 年 12 月收到我的设备后，PinePhone 一直是我日常生活中的重要组成部分，我在 2021 年全年都把它作为我的日常设备。以下是我使用它的经验。

它的性能就像糖浆一样

PinePhone 采用了全志 a64 系统芯片，它的功率只够完成最基本的手机任务。即使是简单的事情，如打开火狐浏览器，也需要将近 20 秒的时间，这无疑要“归功于”它仅有的 4 个核心。这与现代中高端安卓手机形成鲜明对比，所有这些手机都有至少 2GHz 的 8 核处理器。

幸运的是，社区再次介入，对数以千计的小型软件实施了优化。虽然性能仍然不如安卓系统的竞争对手，但这确实意味着 PinePhone 对于大多数手机任务来说是非常适用了，甚至在通过附带的底座使用外部显示器时，也可以使用一些面向桌面的应用程序。

👉关于作者
众所周知，人生是一个漫长的流程，不断克服困难，不断反思前进的过程。在这个过程中会产生很多对于人生的质疑和思考，于是我决定将自己的思考，经验和故事全部分享出来，以此寻找共鸣！！！
专注于Android/Unity和各种游戏开发技巧，以及各种资源分享（网站、工具、素材、源码、游戏等）
欢迎关注公众号【空名先生】获取更多资源和交流！
👉前提
这是小空坚持写的Android新手向系列，欢迎品尝。
大佬（×）
新手（√）
👉实践过程
前面小空带同学们学了EditText控件，又用其实践做了个验证码功能，以为这就完了吗？
然而并没有。

Android在5.0以后引入了Materia Design库的设计，现在又有了Jetpack UI库的设计。帮助开发者更高效的实现炫酷的UI界面，降低开发门槛。
Jetpack我们后面再说，承接之前的EditText，先说说Materia Design里的TextInputLayout。
使用方式是将TextInputEditText或EditText套到TextInputLayout内，这样友情提示信息hit就可以带有动画（上浮为标题），计数/密码可见等属性设置。
 
布局代码


    




    



这样就简单的实现了一个效果。我们在继续深入添加些属性：


    




    


从运行结果可以看出，设置了字数限制后，自动在编辑框右下角显示最大字数和当前输入字数（随着输入情况实时变化），并且更改了颜色样式
😜属性介绍
app:boxCollapsedPaddingTop 设置用于编辑文本在框模式下折叠的顶部填充的值
app:boxStrokeErrorColor 在显示错误时设置轮廓框的描边颜色。
app:boxStrokeWidth 设置描边的宽度
app:boxStrokeWidthFocused 设置获取焦点框的描边宽度
app:counterEnabled     是否显示计数器
app:counterMaxLength 设置计数器的最大值,与counterEnabled同时使用
app:counterTextAppearance       计数器的字体样式
app:counterOverflowTextAppearance 输入字符大于我们限定个数字符时的字体样式
app:errorEnabled  是否显示错误信息
app:errorTextAppearance    错误信息的字体样式
app:endIconCheckable 设置是否显示结束图标
app:endIconContentDescription 为结束图标设置内容说明
app:endIconDrawable 设置结束图标图像
app:endIconMode 设置模式
app:endIconTintMode 指定混合模式，用于将 指定的色调应用于可绘制的结束图标。
app:helperText 设置帮助文本
app:helperTextEnabled 设置是否激活帮助文本
app:helperTextTextColor 设置帮助文本颜色
app:hintAnimationEnabled  是否显示hint的动画,默认true
app:hintEnabled    是否使用hint属性,默认true
app:hintTextAppearance      设置hint的文字样式(指运行动画效果之后的样式)
app:passwordToggleDrawable    设置密码开关Drawable图片,于passwordToggleEnabled同时使用
app:passwordToggleEnabled      是否显示密码开关图片,需要EditText设置inputType
app:passwordToggleTint     设置密码开关图片颜色
app:passwordToggleTintMode    设置密码开关图片(混合颜色模式),与passwordToggleTint同时使用

本文是关于 Flutter 中的 Chip 小部件。我们将大致了解小部件的基本原理，然后通过代码来实现它。事不宜迟，让我们开始吧。

概述
典型的chip是一个圆角的小盒子。它有一个文本标签，并以一种有意义且紧凑的方式显示信息。chip可以在同一区域同时显示多个交互元素。一些流行的chip用例是：
发布标签（您可以在许多 WordPress ，VuePress，知乎，掘金，公众号或 GitHub等大型平台上看到它们）。
可删除的内容列表（一系列电子邮件联系人、最喜欢的音乐类型列表等）。

在 Flutter 中，您可以使用以下构造函数来实现 Chip 小部件：
Chip({
  Key? key, 
  Widget? avatar, 
  required Widget label, 
  TextStyle? labelStyle, 
  EdgeInsetsGeometry? labelPadding, 
  Widget? deleteIcon, 
  VoidCallback? onDeleted, 
  Color? deleteIconColor, 
  bool useDeleteButtonTooltip = true, 
  String? deleteButtonTooltipMessage, 
  BorderSide? side, 
  OutlinedBorder? shape, 
  Clip clipBehavior = Clip.none,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[按照上一期的视频设置好全屋漫游的 WiFi 以后，发现房间里的智能家居设备变得更加不稳定了？这是因为智能家居产品使用的 WiFi 芯片和固件驱动不支持 802.11r 漫游协议造成的。那么本期的视频就和大家一起设置全屋多WiFi 设置，让你的手机漫游不丢包，智能家居不掉线！
 
视频章节：
0:00 开场
1:27 多SSID设置
2:49 启用mDNS服务
3:10 启用UPnP服务
4:03 总结
 
如果喜欢文字版本的内容，这里也将字幕全部码出来了：
What’s up 大家好，欢迎收看本期的 WaveTech 烂科技，我是 Eric。在上一期的视频里说了应该要如何部署一个全屋漫游的 Wi-Fi，那么这一期的视频呢，主要来说说看家里准备要部署或者已经部署了全屋智能小伙伴该如何设置全屋Wi-Fi呢？其实很简单，就是忘记上一期视频的内容。哈哈哈哈，为什么这么说呢？我们每年换的新款 iPhone，都是使用了最强大的一线主流 WiFi 芯片，运行的全功能的 iOS 操作系统，对同步双频，对802.11r Wi-Fi漫游支持的都非常完美。但是通常智能家居的设备呢，由于价格就摆在那里，用的不知名小厂的 WiFi 芯片和不知到什么分支的开源 Linux 系统，对于这些Wi-Fi漫游都没有进行完整的支持。所以大家在设置这类产品的时候，常常会遇到两个问题，一个就是在入网的时候，产品就会要求独立的 2.4G 网络才能完成设置，或者在WiFi漫游的网络下时常容易掉线。针对这些问题，这里准备一些全屋Wi-Fi的设置技巧要和你们分享一下。
 
首先，第一个就是要选择支持多 SSID 的WiFi路由器，要了解 SSID，首先要了解的另一个名词BSS，全称是 a Wireless basic service set, 中文翻译过来就是无线服务集，说人话呢，就是无线局域网。那么每个无线局域网都会有一个 SSID 全称是 Service Set Identifier 服务集识别码，也就是常说的 WiFi 名称。每个 WiFi 的名称呢，又绑定着一个物理层面的接口，一个由 48 位 MAC 组成的 BSSID。将一个无线局域网的设备划分给不同的物理层面接口，也就是给无线局域网内的设备分组。说了这么多，简单的来说呢，就是例如 Ubnt 的 AP，有 4个 BSSID，也就是最多可以创建 4个不同的 WiFi 名称。每个名称可以设置自己独立的 WiFi 支持特性。这里常见的做法会将笔记本，手机等需要漫游的设备，划分到一个WiFi名称中，而将这些对漫游支持比较差劲的设备单独划分到IoT专用WiFi里，这个 WiFi 可以设置成仅 2.4G 的 WiFi，保证一些对双频支持较差的设备无法入网。同时关闭 802.11r 快速漫游功能，避免智能家居设备因为漫游支持的不完善而掉线。
 
第二个，大多数 HomeKit 的智能家居设备利用内网的 mDNS 服务发现局域网内的其他设备，这里要启用路由器上的 mDNS 的服务。mDNS 可以想象成内网的一台智能家居设备，例如智能灯泡，拿了个小喇叭，向周围其他设备播报自己的 IP 地址，其他设备可以通过广播中的 IP 地址找到这盏智能灯。
 
最后一个功能是一些依赖云服务的智能家居设备，需要通过云端服务器来完成设备的开关或者智能化操作。那么这里就要依赖到路由器的另外一个功能，uPnP，中文叫即插即用。这个功能是因为我们现在常见的IP 地址是 IPv4，也就是IP协议的第四版本，我们可以把它想象成邮政编码。但是由于这个邮编太短了，所以要给每家每户都分一个邮编，那么邮编就不够用了。所以这里又引入了门牌号。uPnP 服务就是用来记住哪个门牌号属于哪个设备。那么所有到这个大楼的快递包裹就要由 uPnP 进行接收，并且分派到每个门牌号上。在不远的未来，全新一代的 IPv6 就解决了不够用的问题，128位 IPv6 地址保证地球上的每一粒沙子都可以获得一个自己的 IP 地址。这时候就不需要 uPnP 帮忙记住门牌号啦。
 
Ok，还没睡着吧？我们总结一下，今天我们说如果打算在家里部署全屋智能的小伙伴们在选择 WiFi 路由器的时候，要注意路由器是否支持多 WiFi 名称设置。将家里需要漫游的手机，笔记本划分到支持漫游的 WiFi 里。并且给智能家居设备开起一个独立的IoT 2.4G WiFi。这样做还有一个好处就是可以独立给 IoT WiFi 设置独立密码。平时用来漫游的 WiFi 要是密码泄露了需要修改密码，也不需要重置整个家中的智能设备。同时开始路由器中的 mDNS 以及 uPnP 功能，保证设备的互相发现以及云服务器的正常链接。如果你还有任何的疑问，欢迎你留下你的评论。如果哪里还有听的不够详细的，也欢迎将播放速度调整为 75% 在看一遍。还有别忘了点赞，关注，我们下期视频见。Bye～

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是韩东君，在《长津湖之水门桥》中饰演第七穿插连第280名战士，神枪手平河。


我相信不仅对我，对每一个参与其中的人来说，《水门桥》都是一部承载着重要意义的电影，从长津湖到水门桥，七连的志愿军战士们踏过一座又一座战场，在一场场汹涌的战火硝烟中冲锋陷阵，为了身后的家，更是为了心中的国。


对我而言，《长津湖之水门桥》中有太多印象深刻的故事了。在完成影片拍摄后的很长一段时间里，那些故事和故事里的人，以及我们一起在拍摄现场所经历的种种，时常在我脑海里复演。相信大家看完电影以后，也会和我有同样的感受。


首先还是先说说平河吧。
我至今还记得第一次在剧本中看到平河这个角色时的第一感受，就是“好奇”。平河是个不太爱讲话的人，无论是在战场内外，你很难通过他说了什么话，来判断他是一个什么样的人。但是在《长津湖》中，他枪法奇准，擅用各种枪械武器，并且还知道圣诞节的由来。这样一来，这个人物的多面性和独特性就凸显出来。在后来的每一次拍摄中，我都会不断地琢磨，平河来自哪里，职业是什么，有什么样的家庭，有什么爱好，抗美援朝战争爆发之前，他有过哪些经历等等。在不断的“自我对话”（其实是韩东君与平河的对话）后，我逐渐找到这个角色的重心——他是一个有学识、有思想、有胆魄，同时又不喜高调的人。


我很喜欢平河的名字，这两个字倒过来念，就是“和平”。无论是在《长津湖》还是《水门桥》中，和平，都是所有人的心愿。我曾跟导演讨论过，想通过设计一些细节，让观众找到一条走进平河内心的道路。所以后来便有了：一场大战过后，平河坐在美军的坦克上，在弹壳上刻下一个“平”字。他把自己每一次的“劫后余生”都纪念在这枚弹壳上，只要上面的“平”字还在不断增加，自己就可以坚持，直到取得最终胜利，和战友们一起回家。对平河来说，弹壳是他的护身符，而在《水门桥》中，有一个大家看不到的细节——平河将弹壳从手腕解下，挂在了他使用的…]]></summary>

如果你日常会有编写操作教程，或有大量编写图文混合文章、PowerPoint的时候，你一定会有以下几个困扰：

如何截图:虽然 Windows 和 macOS 都自带了截图的功能，但因为基本是系统自带的功能，所以大部分只有「全屏幕截图」这一个功能，或者需要按下十分复杂的组合键来完成图片的截取。
如何添加标注：为了确保图片的读者能够找到正确的位置，我们往往会在图片中加入一些标注，帮助读者能够在第一时间找到重点，或帮助用户涂抹掉不需要关注的部分，仅保留核心区域的内容。
如何管理截图：图片被截取完成后，我们应该如何管理这些图片？我们应该如何管理已经标注好的图片？我们如何阻止这些截图？这些都是在管理截图的时候遇见的问题。

而如果你也遇见了这样的问题，这篇文章就是为你准备的，接下来，且听我为你介绍我的截图管理历史。
截图工具演变史
刀耕火种：系统自带截图工具时期
第一个时期，我采用的是最为笨拙的截图方式方法，在 Windows 和 macOS 系统都提供了默认的截图工具。

在 Windows 当中，只需要按下 Win + Printscreen 键，就可以将你当前的屏幕截取，并保存在系统的「图片\屏幕截图」目录中。
知乎《Windows10 自带截屏快捷键》

在 macOS 当中，只需要同时按住以下三个按键：Shift、Command 和3，就会拍摄截图。
Apple《在 Mac 上拍摄截屏》

无论是 Windows 还是 macOS ，都提供了基本的截图工具，但在实际使用的时候，你会发现，你产出的图片(如图1)大多数的时候是这样的：图片中元素极多、无关主题的元素无法被隐藏、桌面背景是你自己自定义的背景等一系列小瑕疵。

大部分单位应该都与我司工作需求相同，很多旧款笔记本升级下完全能够满足大多数人的需要。不管是自己的旧电脑升级还是选购二手笔记本都是一个更为划算的选择。当然二手本的市场需求相对小众，对相关知识的要求门槛更高，价格浮动水平较大，并且绝大部分需要个人有相应的动手能力。仅针对市面上x86/64笔记本的选择与相关配件进行介绍与推荐，文中所提及的价格水平仅供参考。

二手笔记本选购实录与升级记录

2021年的笔记本市场反应，也证明了7nm的4000/5000系列锐龙处理器在性价比上一路高歌，但高性能本还是伴随着矿潮缺货，需要预购甚至加价；而随着EVO认证和Tiger Lake出现成为标配的雷电4，至今也只能使用雷电3的外设。随着6000系锐龙移动端与12代Intel移动端处理器的上线，笔记本市场可能面临更残酷的洗牌。不过真的是所有人都需要那么“强大”的性能么？很多人的实用需求并不严苛，那么仅仅是想入手一台便宜机器使用， 该怎么办呢？

1.你要知道什么？
现如今笔记本电脑可以说是刚需了，日常工作学习都离不开，而笔记本电脑实际并不是随便买买就行了的产品。电脑城和熟人的套路这里不多做赘述，大家可以查看笔者以前的文章都有对应的描述。单说二手笔记本这个，个人觉得还是尽量选择线上交易，而且尽量选择贩子和二手商家，虽然这些可能会比更人均价高一些，但是能较好的省去识别的过程。而且即便是组装机器，这些贩子也是会做兼容性测试的，图个省心。买货三维大家都懂，你说你全都…]]></summary>

DNS resolvers work.
In this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way –
with a short Go program that does the same thing described in the comic.
The main function (resolve) is actually just 20 lines, including comments.
I usually find it easier to understand things work when they come in the form
of programs that I can run and modify and poke at, so hopefully this program
will be helpful to some of you.
The program is here: https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver/blob/main/resolve.go

When your browser needs to make a DNS query, it asks a DNS resolvers. When
they start, DNS resolvers don’t know any DNS records (except the IP addresses

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[旧年新岁交替，正逢疫情留杭过年，我也得以回顾近几年给自己筹划的所谓「数字生活」，看看有哪些被我抛弃，又有哪些确实值得延续。
用纸笔还是手机：数字生活起源
最早听说「数字生活」这个词语，其实是在一个台湾作者的博客，称作「数位生活」。我在这个作者的文章中看到了非常舒适的一种即时记录方式：使用手机打字。也许你会觉得习以为常，或许你也习惯于在手机上直接记录即时的想法。但是，即便是时至今日，依然有许多人难以接受这件在数字时代理应非常自然的事情。
我的同事们每逢开会总是会携带本子和笔，而我无论是会议或是讨论，带着手机就可以记录下所有需要的内容。领导们至今无法完全接受这样的做法，他们愿意看到大家埋头在本子上写字，却偏偏不希望大家在手机上做记录。
我也记得我在大学时，我们班主任曾经夸过他带的一个学生，事无巨细，每次和老师说话都会带个小便签，随时做笔记，把老师的话记录下来。而像我们一样喜爱在手机上做记录的学生，则会被老师们理解为「老师讲话时管自己玩手机的不懂礼貌的学生」。这样的偏见，即便是大学教授也无法避免。
我曾在家人聚会时，使用手机记录大家所需的饮品，一并去吧台点餐。家人们各自说着自己想要的饮料和要求（例如冷热、加糖），我则埋头在手机上记录。有一个长辈笑着说，现在的年轻人，都直接用手机记下来，听不出是夸赞，还是叹息年轻人对手机使用过度。
在我看来，在备忘方面，手机优于纸笔是显而易见的：

手机比纸笔携带更方便
文字录入的速度更快
后续更能够快速整理、同步

例如我在手机上记录了会议纪要，后续直接可以在电脑上继续编辑，或者发送给相关同事，而如果用纸笔记录，还需要重新录入电脑，显得繁琐而赘余。
当然手机也有不敌纸笔的时候，那就是在涉及画图、大量引用连接的时候。就纯文本的记录而言，我还是更愿意使用手机。
备忘：快速记录
最早的时候，我使用 Evernote 记录。那时候，我刚接触「数字生活」的…]]></summary>

前言
相信各位身处异乡的同学一定会被父母抱怨过家里的网络或者电脑问题，也时不时打开诸如  FaceTime 或者微信视频之类的软件帮助父母远程解决问题。现在国内网络基建发展迅速，几乎做到了 FTTH（光纤入户），但是很多老房子的配套网络硬件都很古老，新房子开发商也会留下很多暗坑。而各大运营商的宽带服务也只解决到光猫端。所以老家的网络一直是我们这些在外漂泊折腾人的心头大痛。
当然每家每户的情况都很不一样，本文我就以我老家三次网络结构调整的一些经验和问题为主，详细讲讲怎么让家中的老人用上舒心的网络。
正文
我家是一个二〇一〇年代中后期的房子，在交房之初国内还处于百兆宽带普及的阶段，因此家庭的基础网络布线还是不错的——做到了 Cat.5e 线布到每个房间，这为之后铺设良好网络建立的良好的条件。但是开发商仍然留了不少暗坑给我，下面让我们先整理一下最开始的网络拓扑结构。
拓扑梳理
最开始我们先看看我家的的结构图以及弱电箱
家中的户型，以及网口分布图
可以看的出几个主要活动的区域的网口覆盖还是相当到位的，但是弱电箱在走廊中间的储物柜中且只有一点点大，塞满了设备的弱电箱简直惨不忍睹：
开发商留下的弱电箱
让我们梳理一下弱电箱中的各个部分和模块的功能：

GPON 光猫：负责光纤入户以及播号，同时需要供给电话信号。
百兆交换机模块两个：负责全屋网络交换，共计两个 12 根网线。
电话线交换模块：负责电话信号拨入以及分发。
有线电视分配器：负责分配有线电视信号。
电源：负责供给弱电箱中的电能。
数字电视线：负责电视盒子（类似 IPTV）的数字接入，…]]></summary>

从梗的角度：Sony can finally get that Halo killer from the devs of Halo.
长期风险还挺大的，Bungie 就不是一个听话干活的团队：

2000 年，Bungie：我们宣布加入微软
2007 年，Bungie：我们宣布离开微软，因为想要独立做开发
2010 年，Bungie：我们宣布已经和动视达成了一项十年期的协议
2018 年，Bungie：因为和动视存在分歧，我们决定分开，Bungie 会是一个独立的……
2022 年，Bungie：我们很高兴宣布，Bungie 已经成为了 Sony Game Studios 的一份子

通过光环成名后就变得非常的投机主义，也相当的又当又立。
几十亿美元的 deal 不是说索尼看到微软收购动视之后赶紧 go shopping 后谈判达成的。Bungie 这帮人应该是大几个月前，收到风声之后 (Bobby Kotick 自己也说，不止和微软谈过，业内大佬很多都知道)，觉得自己奇货可居，动了高价又卖一遍的心思。

说回事件本身，当然还是作为射击品类的防御。
动视之于索尼和微软两大主机平台，就是他们相争之间的一个顶级军火商，拿着 COD 两边钱都要赚。(阿纳海姆之于联邦和吉翁……) 现在动视被收购后，几个最大游戏品类的格局是：

枪：微软大幅占优，稍微扳回来的话是收 EA 拿战地 + 重生 (后者才是大杀器其实……不过 DICE 和重生都是 Vince Zampella 一个老板了)，但索尼钱袋子不够；而堡垒之夜是不可能的，Epic 一定要打通全平台
球：2K 和 EA 还是中立，索尼也不够钱收购，而且球类很依赖 IP 有高额的授权金，不上全平台会很伤
叙事动作：索尼占优，但育碧、R 星、卡普空这些第三方也还在出来好作品，而且索尼的工作室一…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开篇
flow api 已经慢慢被谷歌列为数据流的首选，可以见到官网的数据流篇都慢慢偏向于flow api，虽然LiveData等数据流类型已经深入开发者观念中，但是flow api也正慢慢的崛起出自己的市场。本篇讲的StateFlow是flow api中的一个更偏向于应用层的api，功能也非常和LiveData相似，那么为什么要出一个和LiveData类似的东西的，因为LiveData天生就引入了生命周期相关的概念，从设计角度出发，其实是耦合了生命周期这部分，所以现在才另起炉灶，出现了StateFlow。
接口部分
public interface StateFlow : SharedFlow {
    /**
     * The current value of this state flow.
     */
    public val value: T
}

可以看到StateFlow在SharedFlow上层上添加了一个属性，就是value值，可以被认为当前是当前可观测的值，跟LiveData的value类似。StateFlow更加推崇的是单体状态，所以区别于一般的flowapi（主要是数据流状态），它的实现禁止了一个重置操作。
StateFlowImpl 中
@Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
override fun resetReplayCache() {
    throw UnsupportedOperationException("MutableStateFlow.resetReplayCache is not supported")
}

还有就是一般的flow属于冷流，冷流这个概念就不再赘述，而flow之所以是冷流，是因为只有在collect的时候间接通过flowcollecter的emit方法去产生数据，本质上数据的改变…]]></summary>

B 站在 GitHub 发布了 Real-CUGAN 项目，可让老旧动漫画面变高清。据了解，Real-CUGAN 是一个使用百万级动漫数据进行训练的，结构与 Waifu2x 兼容的通用动漫图像超分辨率模型，支持 2x/3x/4x 倍超分辨率。从官方晒出的对比图来看，修复后的画面比原版要高清得多，即便是“上古画质”如《黑猫警长》等动漫也能实现高清修复，效果十分显著。但该项目并没有指定使用的开源许可证，仅仅只是公开了源代码。


老王点评：“开源”值得鼓励，但是看来他们在“开源”之前没想好，这或许是 B 站在开源方面没有明确的管理和政策吧。




一网站因通过谷歌字体泄露访问者的 IP 地址被德国法院罚款

该网站通过在其网页上加入谷歌字体托管的字体，在未经授权和没有合法理由的情况下将身份不明的原告的 IP 地址传递给谷歌。而这违反了欧洲的《一般数据保护条例》（GDPR）。这种热链接对谷歌字体来说是正常的；这里的问题是，访问者显然没有允许他们的 IP 地址被共享。该网站被法院 罚以 110 美元，如果继续不正当使用谷歌字体，每次罚款 25 万欧元，或最多监禁 6 个月。大约有 5 千万个网站远程使用谷歌字体。


老王点评：好吧，基于两个不用说的原因，国内的网站并不需要忧虑此事。




Redis 7.0 即将迎来“重大性能优化”

本周一，Redis 7.0 迎来了首个候选发布版本。其称有了“重大的性能优化”和其它功能改进，但也有些带来了一些向后兼容性问题。7.0 通过各种优化来“显著”节省了内存资源、降低写入时复制内存的开销、提升内存效率，改进 fsync 来避免大量的磁盘写入和优化延迟表现。


老王点评：一个值得关注的版本，但是我觉得 Redis 已经不是那个曾经小而美的软件了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[应用中的语音识别不仅仅是一个有趣的技巧，而且是一个重要的无障碍功能。




计算机的主要功能之一是解析数据。有些数据比其他数据更容易解析，而语音输入仍然是一项进展中的工作。不过，近年来该领域已经有了许多改进，其中之一就是 DeepSpeech，这是 Mozilla 的一个项目，Mozilla 是维护 Firefox 浏览器的基金会。DeepSpeech 是一个语音到文本的命令和库，使其对需要将语音输入转化为文本的用户和希望为其应用提供语音输入的开发者都很有用。

安装 DeepSpeech

DeepSpeech 是开源的，使用 Mozilla 公共许可证（MPL）发布。你可以从其 GitHub 页面下载源码。

要安装，首先为 Python 创建一个虚拟环境：

$ python3 -m pip install deepspeech --user


DeepSpeech 依靠的是机器学习。你可以自己训练它，但最简单的是在刚开始时下载预训练的模型文件。

$ mkdir DeepSpeech
$ cd Deepspeech
$ curl -LO \
  https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/deepspeech-X.Y.Z-models.pbmm
$ curl -LO \
  https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/deepspeech-X.Y.Z-models.scorer


用户应用

通过 DeepSpeech，你可以将语音的录音转录成书面文字。你可以从在最佳条件下干净录制的语音中得到最好的结果。然而，在紧要关头，你可以尝试任何录音，你可能会得到一些你需要…]]></summary>

Modules in Lambda
The Node14 Lambda runtime recently got support to ES6
modules and top-level await. Using them, the handler can support more modern structures.
Previously, the handler had to use CommonJS:

// commonjs

// import is via require
const dep = require("./dep.js");

// export is with module.exports
module.exports.handler = async (event) => {
	return "success";
};


Now it can use ESM:

// esm

// import
import dep from "./dep.js";

// export
export const handler = async (event) => {
	return "success";
};


This is great news, as the whole JS ecosystem is moving towards native modules and away from CommonJS. For example, node-fetch v3 is
ESM-only and updating to that broke Lambda handlers. In
the future, it is expected that more packages will foll…]]></summary>

RenderObject 的类型
我们知道 Element 主要分为负责渲染的 RenderObjectElement  和负责组合的 ComponentElement 两大类，而创建 RenderObject 节点的是前者 mount() 方法中调用的 RenderObjectWidget.createRenderObject() 方法。
该方法是一个抽象方法，需要子类实现，对于不同的布局的 Widget 创建的 RenderObject 类型也不一样，在 Render Tree 中最主要的有两种 RenderObject：
首先是在 RenderObject 注释说明中大量提到了一个类 RenderBox，它是大部分的 RenderObjectWidget 所对应的 RenderObject 的抽象类
/// A render object in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
/// 一个在 2D 坐标系中的渲染对象
abstract class RenderBox extends RenderObject

以及 Render Tree 的根节点 RenderView
/// The root of the render tree.
/// Render Tree 的根节点，处理渲染管道的引导和渲染树的输出
/// 它有一个填充整个输出表面的 RenderBox 类型的唯一子节点
class RenderView extends RenderObject with RenderObjectWithChildMixin

其他的类型的 RenderObject 基本是为了特定布局（如滑动、列表）的实现，但大部分都直接或间接集成自 RenderBox。

原文链接 ： https://medium.com/iecse-hashtag/flutter-for-web-in-2022-a-deep-dive-96cf1b5695a9 原文的意思是深入探索，但是个人觉得其实是简单探索。
跨平台开发已经成为过去几年的趋势之一，毫无疑问大多数时候开发人员对跨平台社区充满热情，而 Google 凭借着其 UI 框架—— Flutter 进入了这个市场。
但是将跨平台的支持也扩展到 Web 上其实并不容易，而 Flutter 的解决方案就是 Flutter for Web
简介：是什么和为什么
Flutter 是一个 Google 的一个跨平台 UI 框架，旨在帮助开发人员创建更接近原生、高性能和更有吸引力的移动端应用，然而 Flutter 的目标是为每个设备窗口创建用户界面，而不仅仅是在移动应用上。
对于 Web 的支持，Flutter 提供了与其移动端相同的开发体验，这得益于便捷的 Dart 、Web 平台生态的强大、以及 Flutter 框架的灵活拓展， 现在开发者可以直接创建 iOS 和 Android 之外的 Web 应用。
由于对于 Web 来说，它和  iOS 和 Android 是使用同一个 Flutter 框架， Web 只是开发者项目里可支持的框架之一，所以一般情况下，你可以将用 Dart 编写的原有 Flutter 项目直接编译成 Web 体验。
在这里我们将分析 Flutter web（与 React、Angular 和 Vue 等 SPA 框架的对比）、桌面（与 Electron 和 Qt 对比）的当前状态，并希望在未来通过一些额外的努力实现兼容嵌入式设备等等。
但是..它是如何工作的？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天除夕，然而今年除夕不是“大年三十”，是“大年廿九”。
理解这个事情，有几个层次。
第一层：还有多少“大年廿九”？
我考察了前后各一个世纪（1920s-2110s）的数据，发现两百年间，有118个“大年三十”、83个“大年廿九”。列表如下：
“大”表示30天的大月，“小”表示29天的小月
第二层：为什么会有三十/廿九（大小月）的差别？
因为月相变化周期（朔望月）的平均长度是29.530588天，不是整数。农历为了确保每个“朔”（新月）都在初一，必须根据实际月相调整每个月的长度，使之取29天或30天。
当然，你可能意识到了，“平均长度”意味着每个朔望月的长度是可以有变化的。实际上变化范围可以相当大：从不足29.3天到29.8天多，可以浮动半天还多。

第三层：那么大小月是由朔望周期决定的吗？
不难理解，不只由朔望周期决定。
假设这个月的新月开始于某天0时，假设这个月的朔望周期是29.5天，那么下一个新月出现在第30天中午12点——也就是说第30天会被定义为下个月初一，本月就只能享有29天，成为小月。
但如果这个月的新月开始于某天12时之后，下一个新月出现在第31天午夜0时之后，那么第31天才会被定义为下个月初一，本月可以成为拥有30天的“大月”。
所以，大小月由两个参数决定：本月月初的新月出现在几点，以及本月的朔望周期。如下图所示。
图中橙色、蓝色点的分界线，就是次月新月刚好卡在第30天、第31天之间的午夜0时的情况。

第四层：为什么“大年三十”比“大年廿九”多？
按照朔望周期平均29.53天考虑，大月、小月的数量之比应该是53:47～1.13。
我统计了1921到2121这两个世纪，其中大月有1319个，小月有1167个，1319:1167=1.130，完全符合预期。
但是，同期的大年三十和大年廿九的比例，却是118:83=1.42，比预期的1.13显著更大，这是为什么呢？
我画出朔望周期在每年各个月份的分布：

可以看出，年底年初的朔望周期，平均来说比年中的朔望周期要长4个小时——这是因为，地球在1月份到达近日点，绕日公转最快，此时月球需要追更长时间才能到达同样的相位，因此朔望周期较长。
因此农历十二月，也就有更大的机会分到大月。

总结：
朔望月的平均长度是29.530588天，但是可以在约29.3到29.8之间浮动。
农历大小月取决于当月和下月的新月出现在哪天。或者说，取决于当月月初的新月时刻和该月朔望周期。
虽然大小月的总体比例接近53:47，但是腊月的大小月比例显著较高，可达1.42，因此大年多“三十”，较少“廿九”。
你明白了吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我是一只过着极其简单的生活，除了差旅之外天天两点一线的科研狗，看「闲书」是我的主要娱乐方式之一。多年前我就作为很早的一批用户购买过一台掌阅的六英寸阅读器，可惜后来几乎不再拥有完整的阅读时间，它最终闲置在了抽屉里。
然而一次少数派的 这篇文章 让我意识到原来墨水屏设备已经如此多样。想到自己迅速退化的视力，我又蠢蠢欲动起来。经过反复考量，我认为我需要的墨水屏设备最好和手机差不多大以便和手机并排携带，同时只要能流畅阅读 epub 格式的电子书即可。有此想法时墨案迷你阅尚未上市，因此只要大小这一条要求就足以把我的选择范围限制在海信的墨水屏手机上。
为了最大限度降低冲动消费可能造成的恶果，我选择了当时最便宜的海信 A5 pro。我甚至特意找了好几家店最终买到了内存容量 3G+32G 的版本，以防止自己禁不住诱惑往里面装太多书，导致每一本都浅尝辄止而最终放弃阅读。
使用了将近一年之后，我发现这部墨水屏手机不仅极大地丰富了我的业余生活（如果科研狗也配有业余生活的话），而且改变了我的很多习惯、挽救了我的视力，成为我最重要的电子设备之一。以下是我对这一年使用体验的小小总结，希望对有同样兴趣或需求的人提供一点参考。
基本性能：满足需要、超越期待
小尺寸
这是这部手机能在我的生活中发挥重要作用的必要条件。这部 5.84 英寸的手机甚至比我的主力机（5.99 英寸）还小一圈，可以轻松和主力机一起放进口袋或臂包，单手操控也毫无压力。这使得我可以带着这个设备去任何地方，在公交地铁上随时取放并用不扶握栏杆的那只手操作它。
屏幕
据说 276 ppi 的屏幕分辨率不算太高，不过迟钝的我从来没有注意到过锯齿。
主屏、掌阅阅读界面和邮箱收件箱界面
内存
事实证明，3G 运行内存完全可以满足需要——前提是我只用它看书，偶尔作为备用机收发短信和打电话，极个别时候听音乐和上网查资料。而在这种情况下，显然 32G 的…]]></summary>

和往年一样，各大游戏平台也适时举行了各种春节促销活动；为了给你的红包找一个好去处，我们在 Steam、Epic、PlayStation、Switch 平台上挑挑拣拣，选出了一些折扣诱人，值得购买的游戏。以下就是这些史低或是好价游戏的汇总，希望大家都能度过一个愉快的春节！
Steam：史低佳作不少
Steam 今年的农历新年特卖将于 2 月 3 日上午 10 时截止，结束得比其他平台都稍微早一些。
节日特卖必然会出现的免费贴纸，这次也没有缺席；特卖期间，每天都可以在 Steam 的「点数商店」中领取一张免费的动画贴纸；贴纸也都是很应景的「萌」虎主题，可爱程度还是挺足的。怎么说呢，不领白不领吧。

除此之外，虎年的个人资料装扮以及一张静态表情还同步上架了「点数商店」，不过这俩都是需要使用点数兑换的：

至于特卖活动本身，从折扣幅度来说，紧接着年底假日档的春节特卖注定不会特别抓人眼球；但细细一看的话，其实史低的佳作还是不少。
首先是原价 459 元的《女神异闻录5 乱战 魅影攻手》，五折后仅需 229.5 元即可收入囊中。虽然这部作品很好地将 P5 的魅力和亮点融入了类「无双」的动作玩法；但是，SEGA，为什么先不把 P5R 搬上 PC 呢？毕竟这一部的故事可是接续原作的呀……

假期要是有大把空闲时间等着消磨，那来一个种田游戏也不错？只不过，《符文工房 4 特别版》除了播种和收获环节，还有着地牢探险等战斗玩法，这也使得它的体验更为接近一款 ARPG。论要素的丰富程度，这部作品定不会让你失望，事实上，许多老粉丝对这部作品的评价甚至高过新作……

本作此次八折史低，折后 152 元，要低于 Switch 版。
对于 CRPG 爱好者而言，料足大碗，广受赞誉的《开拓者：正义之怒》，也迎来了八折史低，折后仅 150.4 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近看了好几篇文章都提倡一个观点，要建立自己的系统，把想做的事融入到日常生活中，变成一种习惯。我打算实践一下，开始构建自己的系统。系统有很多种分类，有一种可以是理论与行动。而知识体系是理论的基石，我选择用 obsidian 搭建知识体系的主要结构，flomo 作为快速输入和短文字的部分填充枝叶（以前的文章里介绍过 flomo），后续我还会分享关于行动的部分。
linlin:D 的 obsidian 界面
刚开始写知识体系这个主题的时候我是只打算写 obsidian 的，实践的过程中使用 obsidian 做笔记时排版和移动端的流畅度上不如 flomo ，最终我发现两者配合使用更好。
这篇文章主要分成两个部分：

为什么是 obsidian
我的使用案例分享。这部分我会介绍如何搭配 flomo 使用。

为什么是 obsidian
所有数据都以 markdown 等通用格式离线保存在本地
这个好处只用一个词形容就是，放心。
你可以放心地写搭建自己的永久知识库，不用担心软件倒闭后笔记石沉大海，只要自己做好备份，这些笔记就一直在你的设备上，不依赖于软件服务器。如果对 obsidian 不满意还可以随时把文件夹导入到别的笔记软件里跑路。

强大的双链
虽然这两年双链笔记有很多，但是 obsidian 好像是最强大的，不仅有一般的引用：在当前文本里用双括号把页面名包起来，就可以从 [[页面名]] 点击跳转到那个页面，也可以再回到跳转前的页面。
而且有出链功能，也叫潜在链接。它会根据你当前笔记的内容判断可能跟哪些页面有关系。比如你有一篇笔记里内容有「双链」这个关键词，同时你又有一篇笔记命名为「双链」，则潜在链接里会显示提及「双链」的部分可以建立一个引用。
流畅轻便的交互
我对 App 交互的流畅度特别敏感，用了很多同类软件，obsidian 是比较顺手的了，而且性能很强，看到测评说打开…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[众所周知，Chrome 浏览器是基于 Chromium 这个开源浏览器项目，但两者有着不小的区别，比如 Chrome 支持的系统平台其实是很有限的（这一点有点反常识），虽然目前主流的 Mac、Windows 等桌面平台都有对应的安装包，但 Linux 上只有 RPM 和 Deb 格式的安装包，且 Linux 安装包仅支持 X86-64 结构系统。因此如果你使用非 Debian/RHEL 发行版的 Linux（比如 Acrh Linux）或者是树莓派这样的 ARM 架构的设备，就只能安装 Chromium 浏览器——他基本上涵盖了大部分的系统平台。但唯一的问题是，从 2021 年 3 月开始 Google 开始限制 Chromium 浏览器登录 Google 账户，现在的 Chromium 浏览器中点击账户登录是没有 Google 账户登录入口的，好在 Chromium 官方也给出了相应的方法来教我们一步步的找回 Google 账户登录功能。

加入相应的 Chrome 群组来获得相应权限
根据 Chromium 有关获取相应 Google API 的要求，我们首先要加入 chromium-dev 这个 Google 群组来获取相应的 API 权限，这里你可以选择加入群组但不订阅群组邮件，因为我们只需要获得相应的 API 权限就行。
创建恢复 Google 账户登录项目
这里打开 Google Cloud（没有注册的话用 Google 账号注册一个），点击左上角项目选择「新建项目」。

项目名称最好有所区别，这里我特意新建一个单独项目并命名，然后点击「创建」。

然后回到当前项目的控制台，这里展开左边的汉堡菜单，找到「API 和服务」-「OAuth 同意屏幕」，选择「外部」然后再点击「创建」。

下面就是要创建一个信息，设定「应用名称」（我这里命名为 chromium login），然后「用户支持电子邮件」这里输入后面需要登录的 Google 邮箱。

在第二步「范围」这里，选择「添加测试用户」，然后输入测试用户的邮箱，这里填写后面那个需要登录的 Google 邮箱。点击「添加」然后「保存并继续」。

OAuth 同意屏幕创建好之后，我们回到控制台，然后还是从汉堡菜单中选择「API 和服务」-「库」。开始启用各种 API 库，这里我们需要启动的库包括：

Cloud Search API
Google Drive API
Safe Browsing API
Time Zone API
Admin SDK
Chrome Sync API
Chrome Web Store API
Chrome Spelling API

你可以搜索关键词然后点击「启用」即可，开启之后无需进一步的操作。

再次回到控制台，在汉堡菜单中找到「API 和服务」-「凭据」，这里需要创建可以调用这些 API 的关键 key，在凭据页面中点击「创建凭据」。

首先我们需要创建「API 密钥」，这里会直接生成一段 键值，记得将其保存到相应的位置；然后我们需要创建「OAuth 客户端 ID」，这里记得选择「桌面应用」，然后会生成对应的 客户端 ID 以及对应的客户端密钥，同样复制并保存下来。

将密钥加入到系统环境变量中
这里我们需要将上面获得的值、密钥等加入到你的系统环境变量中，打开系统终端，使用 vim 编辑环境变量文件（无需提权）：
vim ~/.xprofile
按键盘的 i 进入编辑模式，然后输入下面的环境变量内容：
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=API 密钥「键值」
export GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID=OAuth 客户端 ID
export GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET=OAuth 客户端 ID 对应的密钥
编辑完成之后按 esc退出编辑模式，在输入:wq 保存，然后直接注销当前的系统再重新登录，打开你的 Chromium 的账户入口，就可以看到 Google 账户登录入口了。

当不满足官方的ProgressIndicator的时候，作为一名优秀的安卓开发者，肯定要自定义一个啦

自定义ProgressIndicator
compose的Canvas提供了丰富的Api足以满足我们打造各种炫酷效果，我们只管发挥想象力，之前我有写过用Compose画太阳和月亮，感兴趣的可以去我的文章里面看。
传统写法Android自定义加载进度条+自定义Dialog简洁弹窗 - 掘金 (juejin.cn)
首先用Canvas的drawLine简单画一条直线
Canvas(modifier.padding(16.dp).fillMaxWidth()) {

        val canvasWidth = size.width  // 画布的宽
        val canvasHeight = size.height  // 画布的高

        drawLine(
            color = Color.Green,
            start = Offset(0f, 0f),
            end = Offset(canvasWidth, 0f),
            strokeWidth = 40f         
        )
    }


用StrokeCap设置成圆角
cap = StrokeCap.Round

这绿太刺眼换一个

接着传值让它动起来
value的范围 0~100
那么进度条的宽度就是画布的总宽度× (value/100)

少数派深入仓库慰问留深水獭
新春佳节来临之际，为了让水獭们感受到少数派的关心爱护，1 月 30 日早上 6 时许，部分少数派员工在站长老麦的带领下，来到官方商城仓库一线，慰问滞销留深的水獭。老麦与水獭亲切交流，详细询问了它们的生活情况，对它们去年做出的贡献表示了充分的肯定，致以春节的祝福。
慰问活动现场
探访过程中，老麦亲切询问了一些水獭不能回家过年的原因。一名原籍在水族馆的水獭表示，听老家邻居企鹅说当地今年春节只允许居民玩 14 个小时的游戏，因此宁愿不回去。一名员工听后立刻捐出了自己的进口游戏机，请它尽情畅玩，但注意保护视力。
在视频通话慰问一名正居家观察的水獭时，其称月初某天正外出吃派，突然好奇「π」之前的字母是什么，便搜索了希腊字母表，找到答案后大声反复朗诵，结果发现行程码突然变黄，随即被附近热心群众带走隔离。少数派员工当即为它发放了专属红包封面，并勉励它说，「红包都来了，绿码还会远吗？」
此次慰问，充分体现了少数派对水獭工作的重视及对一线水獭的关怀。水獭们纷纷表示，绝不辜负老麦、少数派、少数派读者的殷切期望，在虎年工作中更加恪尽职守、认真履责，交上一份「一獭虎途」的答卷。
传少数派拟开展餐饮业务
近日，网上有传闻称少数派可能在策划进军餐饮行业。据了解，该传闻的起源是社交网络上一张来源不明的截图，其中称少数派重金采购了屠龙刀，可能是用来切菜。此外，根据对少数派办公室附近快递包装的成分检测，发现大部分跟小红薯是一致的，怀疑是该团队正在测试食材。截图还称，少数派的新业务是为了满足「真实、迫切的需求」，最近已经「吃堡撑了」等，这显然是指供应食物。
传闻推文
对此，记者试图向该网站寻求回应，但因为其不调休就提前放假，未能成功联系。一位匿名差评用户在接受采访时表示，他本来以为少数派是专注于 iOS 任务管理和笔记应用的网站，结果注册后不仅发现了大量关于 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[黄色的开端
前几天用Okhttp的时候写了一个请求，代码突然变黄了。通常来说会这样写，就算封装也离不开4步
withContext(Dispatchers.IO){
    val client = OkHttpClient.Builder().build()
    val request = Request.Builder().build()
    client.newCall(request).execute()
}

但是它突然变黄了

我本以为是IO的警告，加上try、catch还是不行，鼠标一动到黄色位置,提示警告：
Inappropriate blocking method call 
黄色的原因
不适当的阻塞方法调用
这是什么意思呢？
变成了 这个任务在一个线程上运行。不完全利用。
探索黄色
okhttp点进去看
  @Throws(IOException::class)
  fun execute(): Response

  fun enqueue(responseCallback: Callback)

原来抛出了IOException。
猜想，try、catch不能清除黄色，那么肯定更异常没关系。写了一个方法，修改抛出的异常
@Throws(NullPointerException::class)
fun execute() {
}

结果只有IOException会这样。
就4行代码，肯定和协程有关。
既然是协程，又是IO问题，看了一眼IOException类，又点了一下，看看继承IOException，被60多个类继承了。

看到了SocketException，突然想到，Socket也是一个IO操作，假设Socket连上了，然后阻塞在了这里，如果Socket突然断开了，通常会try、catch，关闭Socket。
withContext(Dispatchers.IO){
    //...
    IO操作
    //...
}

在协程里有个请求，协程不知道它IO操作要多久，假设IO他一直在执行，那协程可能就单独放到一个线程执行，一直阻塞。这不能发挥 协程的 真正作用。所以编译器提示了警告：这个阻塞不太适当
解决黄色
原因：协程认为可能抛出IO异常的代码，可能会一直阻塞，把代码放到线程执行。
协程就是处理耗时任务，只是不想浪费资源。所以 我们期望都在协程上执行。
解决：把代码 丢到一个可取消的协程上执行
val response = suspendCancellableCoroutine {
    client.newCall(request).execute()
}

表示这段代码可以被取消。成功则返回Response，失败则取消这个协程。关于异步同样可以使用call.cancel()
关于
关于我的Httplib，对Okhttp进行了简单的封装。OnceHttp
使用：
ktHttpConfig(this) {
    host = "https://www.wanandroid.com/"
    //公共的 header参数
    header["appVersion"] = "1.0.0"
    //公共的 body参数
    //mapData["appVersion"] = "1.0.0"
    //可以传入一个client
    //okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder().build()
}

请求继承 OnceRequest() 就好，api、header、body可以自由更改
OnceRequest，增加了两个拦截的方法
//请求之前 修改 请求的数据
open fun beforeRequest(map:MutableMap) = mapData
//请求之后 修改 返回的数据
open fun  afterRequest(bean:T) : T = bean

在一次请求前，修改参数，在请求后，修改返回的数据。（比如：请求其他服务器，加密解密方式不同）
也提供了3种数据返回方式
requestBackLiveData(): LiveData 
requestBackFlow(): Flow
requestBackBean():T

On January 28th Uxn turned 1 year old! We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed code, ideas, time and laughs to help this project grow into what it is now. It was a wonderful year for smol ordinators. See an image that Rekka made for uxn's birthday.
We finally released versions of the Uxn emulator for all major systems(Linux, OS X and Windows), with the option of a version bundled with a few starter roms. We simplified the guide too, to make it easier to install and use.
Our lion's mane mushroom grew another full head, we harvested it and made some mushroom pakoras.
In other news, Devine was interviewed on Anonradio, listen to it here. Also, Compudanzas released an Introduction to Uxn Programming book, with a foreword by Devine.

For software developers, Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs is a prime example. Written for freshman at MIT, it is
ostensibly an entry-level text. But it requires such a level of
competence in math and physics, and the prose itself is so dense and
archaic, that I couldn't imagine suggesting it to anyone.
And yet it is one of the most recommended books for developers.
This is not to say that SICP is a bad book or that you should not read
it. I just don't think it should ever be suggested to anyone.

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第13天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
简单介绍
MotionLayout是constraintlayout2.0以后才有的功能。
MotionLayout是ConstraintLayout的子布局。专门用来实现运动过程中的控件动画
在Android中实现动画是一件复杂的事情。MotionLayout的问世就是为了化繁为简
MotionLayout是在Android中实现过渡的一种新的有效方法。 它充当布局过渡和复杂运动处理之间的桥梁，在属性动画框架 ， TransitionManager和CoordinatorLayout之间提供了多种功能
MotionScence
作为动画布局中的根节点
ConstraintSet
用于布局ConstraintLayout子项的约束的不变描述
分为开始和结束
使用MotionLayout时要传入开始和结束的ConstraintSet
开始使用
首先导入依赖
//约束布局
implementation("androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout-compose:2.1.0")

写这篇文章时时2.1.0
效果图

首先在ConstraintSet里面定义一个layoutId-xxx
接着在Box引用layoutId
Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .layoutId("xxx")
)

实现这个开关需要4个组件
两个Box和两个Text分别表示按钮背景和开关按钮还有Ligth、dark文本
先写ConstraintSet
按钮背景

数据的转换
对于 Compose 中的数据，用 mutableStateOf() 包裹来实现监听刷新我们已经轻车熟路。那如果一个数据依赖于另一个或多个数据怎么办？这就用到 derivedStateOf()，它专门用于数据的转换，当上游数据发生变化时会自动刷新下游数据，进一步刷新 UI。有点类似 LiveData 中 Transformations.switchMap 的作用。
Show me the code:
setContent {
    var name by remember { mutableStateOf("chenhe") }
    val upperName by remember { derivedStateOf { name.uppercase() } }
    Column {
        Text(upperName)
        Button(onClick = { name = "bob" }) {
            Text(text = "Change Name")
        }
    }
}

upperName 由 name 转换得来，一开始会显示 "CHENHE"，点击按钮后变成 "BOB"。好了，本节到此结束 😋
当然没那么简单 - -
为什么一定要经过包装才行呢？换句话说，套一层 derivedStateOf() 是为了解决什么问题？答案是：
上游数据改变时要重新处理。
上游数据没有改变时，不要重新处理。
诶？变则刷新，不变就不刷新... 听起来很像 remember 的用法？！那就试试看：
var name by remember { mutableStateOf("chenhe") }
val upperName = …]]></summary>
