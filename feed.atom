        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how you can send custom emails with just NodeJS, two sweet npm packages, and a single email address.
The best part?  No email hosting is required, you can do this for no cost at all, and all in under 50 lines of code!
Let's get started!
In this example, I'll be using gmail to get an email.  You may do this anywhere else, but I would prefer google due to how easy it is to get an alternate email account.
After signing up for google, go to https://myaccount.google.com/, go to the Security section and scroll to the Signing in to Google section.

To be able to send emails, you'll need an app password from your google account.  You can obtain this after setting up two-step verification.  If you are not using google, use the password for that email account …]]></summary>

A date picker component integrating mui's date picker with React Hook Form's form context. It uses the Controller component from React Hook Form(RHF) and configures mui's  DatePicker to handle validations and more. I use this component instead of mui's DatePicker in all my forms. 
 It inherits all the behaviours from DatePicker of mui and accepts all DatePicker props as-is.
 It takes name, formContext and defaultValue required props and registers the DatePicker to the form context of RHF
 It has two modes: edit mode and read-only mode. In read-only mode, it is disabled, has no date picker icon button and is rendered as a standard(underline) TextField. In edit mode, it is rendered as outlined TextField.
 It builds in the required validation rule and takes a required prop.
It builds in a validation rule for invalid date input
 It accepts validation rules and enforces them.
 It takes an optional onChange prop. It will update the value and trigger the given onChange method on change.
It has a default mask and date format and can be changed with props.
 It defaults to size small, full width and shrink label.
It set time to end of the day.
It takes a style prop for styling the underlying TextField.
matchMedia is mocked so that the date picker can be rendered in desktop mode with the date picker icon button
TestComponent sets up a React Hook Form environment and shows how the SUT can be used.
FormForTesting is a testing utility component for testing React Hook Form form components.
The tests are grouped into three categories: appearance, behaviours and validations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements which we can use in other Python programs.
Modules in Python can be of two types:
Built-in Modules.
Modules allows us to use the functionality we need when we need it, and it keeps our code cleaner.
The functions we import as part of a module stays in their own namespace.(A namespace is simply a space within which all names are different from each other). The same name can be reused in different namespaces but two objects can’t have the same name within a single namespace.
For example, Many cities have a street called “Main Street”,
Another example is the folder organization of file systems. One can have a file called "todo" in her work folder as well as her personal folder, but she knows which is which because of the folder it’s in; each folder has its own namespace for files.
One important note, human names are not part of a namespace that applies uniqueness; that’s why governments have invented unique identifiers to assign to people, like passport numbers.
In order to use Python modules, we have to import them into a Python program.
1)If we import morecode in a code, that imports everything in morecode.py. To invoke a function f1 that is defined in morecode.py, we can write morecode.f1().
morecode.f1
Note that we have to explicitly mention morecode again, to specify that we want the f1 function from the morecode namespace.If we just write f1(), python will look for an f1 that was defined in the current file, rather than in morecode.py.
2)We can also give the imported module an alias (a different name, just for when we use it in our program). For example, after executing import morecode as mc, 
3)A third possibility for importing occurs when we only want to import SOME of the functionality from a module and we want to make those objects be part of the current module’s namespace. 
For example, we could write from morecode import f1. Then we could invoke f1 without referencing morecode again: f1().]]></summary>

Ancak, çok sayıda model sınıfımız varsa, tüm JSON ayrıştırma kodunu elle yazmak zaman alıcı ve hataya açık hale gelir. Neyse ki, süreci otomatikleştirmek için json_serializable ve Freezed  gibi kod oluşturma araçlarını kullanabiliriz .
Bu yazıda, Freezed paketini kullanarak kod oluşturma (code generation) ile JSON verilerinin nasıl ayrıştırılacağını öğreneceğiz .

Every developer have to ensure that his/her application is working as expected. A safeguard to that purpose are unit tests.
An Angular CLI generated project comes by default with Karma and Jasmine for unit testing. However, there are people who prefer other tools such as Jest.
I'm not going, in this post, to compare or choose the one over the other. I will only show you the steps to move from Karma/Jasmine to Jest. At the end, it's just a case of taste.
Uninstall the npm packages:




npm uninstall karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-coverage karma-jasmine karma-jasmine-html-reporter jasmine-core @types/jasmine

Delete the no more needed Karma configuration files:

Make Googling a habit or thou shall make very little progress in programming.


If it works, do not touch it unless you know what you are doing.


JavaScript might be well spoken of but it is not your friend.


Never debug in production.


Argue not about programming languages on Twitter.


Do not claim you know CSS. It is a lie, we all know.


Eat in the morning before you start programming. Otherwise you may not eat again.


No matter how sure you are, always clear your browser cache and try again.


It is easier to stay up till 6:00 AM than to wake up at 6:00 AM. Be discipline with your sleep cycle.


Always hide your wifi network SSID. There are others who are more dangerous than you think.

So what are git aliases ? In simple words, aliases are custom shortcuts for executing regular git commands. These shortcuts are specified in the file $HOME/.gitconfig. Lets start with some examples.
In order to see the current status, the command would be
git status

Alternatively we can create an alias
git config --global alias.st status

And now, to see the git status we can run the command
git st

Similarly, more and more aliases can be added for easier and quick execution of commonly used git commands. Lets add some more aliases.
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.co checkout

简介:
这是一个活动主题，参与这个活动的方式可以是晒出 "Google 眼中的你" 的截图，也可以是友好的评论其他的用户分享的 "Google 眼中的他"。
我们不希望您对他人的由 Google 为他生成的用户画像进行恶意或无端的揣测，本身这个结果并不准确（我自己根据结果推断正确率只有 50%左右），并且这应该是一个开心的活动。
推荐您在上传您的截图时对重要或敏感的信息打码处理。
本质上，这是一个类似往年由社区用户 @mrhero 发起的诸如: 「 XXXX 年度晒桌面」活动 这样的 V 站的传统活动，感谢 @mrhero 对我的启发让我在看到了 Google 的这个页面后第一时间想到来 V 站发起这个活动。
最后，我们希望拥有一个和平的，没有互联网跟踪的美好世界。
祝你新年快乐！

事情很简单，一个月前换了软路由之后一起把网线也换成了山泽的 6 类扁平线，想着柔软易推倒好走线，而且在单位用一直也没问题。但是过了几天，软路由上的两个 LAN 口和 WAN 口就开始随机一个掉到百兆。
因为软路由是新加的，所以一开始以为是驱动问题，后来以为是散热问题，再后来把软路由也换了，还是会随机其中一个口协商成百兆。期间还用过一条秋叶原的 7 类扁线，做工是不错，但线径超细，线缆就比普通扁平线厚一点，简直是辣鸡。最后找了几条 24awg 的泛达圆线都换了，直到现在一切都正常了……仔细一看，tnnd 这不是一个月前换下来的网线嘛？？

之前买过华为 Matebook X Pro 低配，做前端开发来说，性能不太行，凑活够用。后来入职某公司配 Macbook Pro 之后就干脆把 Matebook X Pro 卖了。结果去年年底把我恶心到了就离职了，现在工作上只是配了个简单的主机，有段时间没有笔记本了。业余在家主要用的是 NUC i7-10710U。
没有移动办公的工具还是差点意思，不能把自己熟悉的环境搬到任何地方还是有点难受。另外业余自己也会写点代码，写点文章啥的。笔记本打算用来作为纯办公的场景，全能本是最好的，万一自己真想学点 PS 视频剪辑呢 [doge]
需求大致如下：
键盘手感不差，个人机械键盘主要用茶轴
屏幕素质不错，至少 2k 分辨率
性能较好，打底内存得 16G 吧。由于主要使用 WSL 开发，大致搜索了一下，好像 AMD 也不会有什么问题？显卡大概也得考虑下，今年或许真会考虑学习下修图或者尝试下视频剪辑？
颜值不错，毕竟不能拖后腿
另外，苹果笔记本就不考虑了，用了一年多 Macbook Pro 都不习惯，新的 M1 笔记本看着刘海我就难受。现在个人更偏向于 Windows + WSL 的组合，用起来很上头。
最后，个人会看一些数码科普评测节目，比如最近从猪王的选购指南里就觉得小新 Pro 16 锐龙版看起来针不戳，不知道各位大佬怎么看？或者说说个人使用的什么笔记本安利下？]]></summary>

在第一个里程碑中，我们开启了我们通往下一代 Spring 框架的激动人心的旅程，并将我们的最低 JDK 要求从 Java 8 提升到 Java 17 。计划每两个月发布一个新的 Spring Boot 3.0 里程碑。M2 应该会在 3 月 24 日发布，并计划在 11 月下旬发布 GA 版本。
如果您想要尝试使用 Spring Boot 3.0 的应用，需要注意我们已将所有 Java EE API 迁移到 Jakarta EE 。对于大多数用户来说，这意味着您需要将任何 javax 类库替换为 jakarta. 例如，javax.servlet.Filter 将替换为 jakarta.servlet.Filter.
我们仍在等待一些第三方软件库发布 Jakarta EE 兼容版本，因此并非所有 Spring Boot 2.x 功能都可用于第一个里程碑。我们计划在适当的时候将这些功能重新引入。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KDE 开始 15 分钟错误消除计划

该计划用于集中修复许多影响 KDE 桌面的低级错误，这些错误用户在 15 分钟或更短时间内就能发现。其列入标准是，这些错误受 KDE 的默认设置影响，100% 可重现，一些基本的东西不工作或看起来有视觉上的缺陷，可能导致崩溃，需要重启或终端命令来解决或没有解决方法，最近回退的错误，或有超过五个重复的错误报告。在该计划中，第一批 有 56 个错误需要处理。


老王点评：这些不起眼而很重要的工作，才真正能将 KDE 打磨成主流桌面环境。




Opera 发布专门的内置加密钱包的浏览器

Opera 发布 了一个 Web3 Crypto 浏览器，内置加密货币钱包，更易于访问加密货币/NFT 交易所、去中心化应用 dApp 等。Opera 表示新浏览器旨在简化 Web3 用户体验。Web3 是基于区块链的去中心化互联网，是目前加密货币支持者最热衷的新事物。该浏览器的钱包支持包括以太坊、比特币等加密货币。不过，该浏览器在国内被禁止使用。


老王点评：虽然 Opera 逐渐从主流浏览器中落后，但是它专注于游戏、加密货币等领域的努力还是值得赞赏。




因 5G 干扰，国际航空公司正在减少飞往美国的航班

美国的移动电话公司正在推出的 5G 服务，使用频率在 3.7 至 3.98GHz 之间的无线电频谱，即所谓的 C 波段。国际航空业担心美国 5G 服务过于接近雷达高度计使用的频谱，也就是 4.2 至 4.4GHz 之间，因而正在减少飞往美国的航班。但国际航空业认为，欧洲没有面临同样的风险，在欧洲，5G 服务使用频率较慢的 3.4 至 3.8GHz 范围的频谱，和雷达高度仪使用的频谱之间有更大的缓冲区。此外，欧洲也限制了机场附近的 5G 天线的功率和角度，避免了对飞机的干扰。


老王点评：新技术带来的新挑战，不知道国内的 5G 情况如何。]]></summary>

POSIX 简介

与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。

当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。

该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。

为什么有 POSIX？

一句话：可移植性。

60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。

IBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。

不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…]]></summary>

「这局废了，重开吧。」「我不下车了。」

@潘誉晗：45 路公交车在十字路口爆炸，强烈的火光不仅打破了一日的宁静，也带走了许多人的生命。女大学生李诗情和游戏设计师肖鹤云却从这场爆炸中复活，两人一次次经历爆炸，一次次「死而复生」，却也一次次「开局重来」进入了循环……
这部由正午阳光出品，腾讯独播的开年网剧真的「炸」了，虽然同类型的作品早有《土拨鼠之日》《源代码》和《明日边缘》珠玉在前，可毕竟这是国内第一部循环向的剧集，所以总归有一些带着担忧的期待，但一口气看完八集的感觉很好。而本剧又是以 2013 年的厦门公交爆炸案为原型，所以…]]></summary>

说的就是这位 @东北少女vivian 同学：
可以复刻薛记炒货的网红爆款酸奶柑橘片吗？这玩意100多一斤就那么点…
网上几乎没有可用的方子！
受 @知乎美食  邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，让大家在问题下许愿，一眼我就看到了这个心愿，“酸奶柑橘片”这玩意最近风很大啊不是么？！
其实我早就听说过了，但是我不爱吃桔子就一直没下手，直到看到这个心愿，没忍住剁了下手。
就，妙啊。
柑橘还是那个貌不惊人的柑橘，白巧还是那个甜死人毫不愧疚的白巧，两人一组合，就成了网红零食了，关键是，这网红零食它好吃————
也好贵。

如果说去年过年的年度DIY零食新贵是奶枣，那今年盲猜就是这个了。因为它实在优势太明显：
正好赶上柑橘上市季节、价格便宜、步骤简单、酸甜适口、耐存放、老少咸宜。
于是就决定做这个给你们看了！
嘘，别问原因，问就是家里收了3箱子朋友从各地寄来的桔子、橙子等，我实在消耗不完了（此处感谢 @陈大可 等人提供的原料）。

但是由于对网上教程的极度不信任，我还是用分组法，在不同的步骤试验了很多种方法去制作，旨在让你们看完我这一篇絮絮叨叨的回答就都会做。

所以以下，除了正常的“烘烤柑橘片——融化巧克力——裹巧克力涂层——冷却”这4个谁都能看明白的步骤外，我会在每一个步骤都列出来你可能失败的原因，包括但不仅限于：

1、柑橘的选择——决定成品造型和是否发苦
2、烤箱、果脯机、空气炸锅、电暖气哪家强——决定果干烘烤时间和成色
3、巧克力的选择和配料——决定色泽、脆度和味道平衡
4、冷却时间和注意事项——决定保存时间和口感保持

看到这里，你就已经知道我翻车了多少回才有信心写下这个教程了。

那么，“我去买几个橘子，你就站在此地，不要走动。”[1]

A、车辆的准备


1、轮胎和制动系统
轮胎是汽车唯一与地面接触的零部件，其重要性不言而喻。首先，我们需要保证轮胎胎壁没有鼓包，因为鼓包会直接导致爆胎，车辆会失控。其次，我们要确认轮胎没有过度磨损，如果都快成光头胎了，还是赶紧换掉吧，快过年了，汽修店的人都快手关门回老家啦。再者，我们需要一套胎压监测，这比每次都下车踢一脚轮胎来得靠谱。
出发之前，我们必须到4S店或汽修店检查一下制动系统是否运作正常，刹车片是否已经磨到底了，制动液是否该换了。
.
2、三大件
如果真的要跑很久的长途，不妨提早做一个小保养，换换油水，检查刹车，顺便让4S店或者快修店师傅给你检查一下发动机、变速箱、底盘“三大件”是否性能完备。
谁都不想车子在前不着村后不着店的地方抛锚，这还是春节期间呢，谁来拯救你？钱给够当然有救援，但没人想多花两三倍的钱对吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一年又一年，Apple 在今天发布了由 iPhone 13 Pro 拍摄的虎年新春影片《卷土重来》，这部影片是 Apple 发布的第五支新春影片，也是与过去四部影片完全不同的一部作品。

首先是时长，《卷土重来》的片长有 23 分钟之久，与之相比，2018 年发布的首支 Apple 新春影片《三分钟》的片长为 7 分钟、去年发布的《阿年》为 12 分钟。其次是类型元素，与过去人物关系、道具场景都相对简单的四部影片不同，我们在《卷土重来》中可以看到传统武打、好莱坞科幻、乡土情怀、幽默喜剧、父子亲情等多种电影风格类型，道具和场景方面包含了机器人和机器狗、全地形车、火星基地、飞船模型等等，制作规模进一步突破。
《卷土重来》讲述的是电影梦碎的儿子，跟一个异想天开的父亲，为了把无人问津的村子打造成网红景点，率领一众村民拍摄火星大电影的故事。身为替身武打演员的儿子，在一次拍摄中不慎受伤之后无奈回村，接受了电影梦破灭现实的他，希望利用多年积攒下来的积蓄，将父亲接去城市生活，告别土地贫瘠、生活环境恶劣的乡村。父亲则希望为乡村拍摄一部影片，希望通过这部影片将乡村走出困境，同时也帮助儿子圆一次电影梦。
影片从父子之间的矛盾作为展开，儿子希望带领父亲逃离「除了沙尘一无所有，荒凉得跟个火星似的」乡村，前往城市生活；父亲则从儿子的话语中收获了不一样的理解：那就拍一部关于「火星」的电影。这里展现的，不仅是现实中父母与子女常有的矛盾冲突，也代表了两代人对于困难、梦想的不一样的看法：20 岁的儿子虽然怀揣电影梦，但是遇到困难就决定接受现实、放弃梦想；60 岁的父亲却对梦想执着追求，不仅希望帮助儿子圆一次电影梦，也对于生活了一辈子的乡村仍抱有希望，对于村民抱有希望。

影片背后留下的不少线索，也埋藏了对于现代生活的各种还原。比如父亲希望拍摄视频放到网上，将村子打造成网红景点，正是当下短视频时代的一种社会缩影…]]></summary>

不过，除夕当日除了准备年夜饭之外，另一项重要的活动就是大扫除。最初是一种祛除病疫的宗教仪式，后来慢慢发展成了必不可少的习俗，被视作是在新年里远离秽气、晦气和穷气的象征。
图源：unsplash
即使对这样的传统及其附带的意义并不感兴趣，每隔一段时间的大扫除也是十分必要的。对频繁搬家的人来说，至少还可以趁着收拾行李的机会整理、清洁；但如果常年住在同一间房子里，被挡住的卫生死角很容易就被忽视，经年累月下来灰尘和病菌聚集，对居住者的身体健康也会造成一定影响。甚至可以趁着大扫除的时候，对家中物品做个清点，在旧年「断舍离」掉不常用的东西，给家里腾出更多的空间。
接下来将介绍我在大扫除时的一些基本思路，以及一些（希望是）具体可行的操作方法。与上一篇日常家务的文章不同的是，本篇中的清洁会更细致，所需时间更长，体力消耗更大，并且可能需要迁延多日才能完成。
图源：storyset
需要注意的是每个人的房间格局、装修材料、家具设施、使用习惯、清洁要求，以及所在地的气候、习俗、家中人口各有不同，也就带来了清洁方式的差异，请根据自身情况适配。另外，由于笔者近几年来都在国外居住，对国产的家务神器缺乏认知，用的基本上都是最基础的器具，也没有钱买扫地机器人和新风这种所需不菲的设备……如果各位在阅读过程中发现有些问题可以用某种神器替代，也欢迎在评论区喂我安利。（如果直接空投我一个扫地机器人的话也可以！谢谢老板！）
如果以上都可以接受的话，那我们就开始吧！
前置准备
大扫除在所有家务活里并不能算轻松。如果能够提前准备的话，就能减少很多在扫除过程中的困扰。
在这里，「提前准备」包含了两重含义。

第一层是指最好能提前准备好扫除的相关用品，特别是平时不怎么做家务、家里也没有储备的。春节前后，快递的需求增多，因为放…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[哦，这个是我的领域。我暂且认为，我在这个领域，全国范围能排前100问题不大。知乎比我专业的人，应该不会超过10个（我抛砖引玉，其他曾经同行，你们自己看情况）。
我做的是变速箱标定，是某国际大厂，认定的中国区域，仅有的2个驾驶性评估工程师（另外一位是我徒弟）。带我的师傅，是国内某厂混动方案起草人。我一度考虑找自主品牌融资，创业搞变速箱，后来发现自己落后了 ，于是就不搞了，改行了。
我们先得了解做事的目标是什么？汽车是人的四肢的延伸，就像拳头一样，跟随大脑。油门控制的是车速还是扭矩（力量）？是扭矩。因为控制速度，他很反直觉。如果是控制速度，你拳头，一拳打到钢板上，你不会缩回去，会眼睁睁把手打断，这就是速度控制，所以我们的拳头主要是力量控制。车也是一样的，上坡速度自己变慢，下坡变快。
变速箱要做的是把发动机扭矩（动力）更顺畅、高效（调节档位）的传递车轮。
通俗的讲，主要解决2个问题， 换挡点+换挡质量。
首先你说的硬件问题， 是很难创新的，ZF的8AT，奇瑞的CVT，爱信6AT，Getrag的7dct也好，他们是设计好变速箱，就疯狂卖，一般6000-15000块一台，价格关键看扭矩，看你采购量。硬件的每个档位的传动比，基本结构，都不会改动了 ，最多改变下和发动机 链接处，就是表面功夫，密封更好这些。主要调整的是软件。
1）先解决有无问题：换挡点
这块需要根据每个发动机来，发动机的万有特性（就是扭矩、转速、油门开度。功率用的其实是很少）
这里面决定了油耗，动力性， 当然你可以设置几套模式，什么雪地模式（2挡起步），运动模式（推迟换挡点），经济模式（早换挡），内部还会存在爬坡等。当然不同厂家逻辑是不一样的，有的是一套图谱，根据运动，经济等修正，有的可能是几套。
但是，这些本质都是有无问题 ，客户根本不关心，车评人也不关心。
要关心的是：换挡质量（从有到优）
2：换挡质量：聪明、迅捷、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开始这篇文章之前，先说说这两天我在清理电脑存储上的一个插曲。
有着良好电脑使用习惯的我，直到上一次打开 Mac 的储存空间界面，还始终保持着预留至少 50G 的空间来避免可用存储空间过少造成的「心理健康」问题，直到某天清理电脑无用软件时，突然发现电脑只剩 20G 可用，就在那一瞬间，我觉得我与存储空间的多年战斗宣告完败。
一番排查过后，最占用存储空间的是不出意外的微信和企业微信两大「巨头」，足足有 60G 的空间消耗。这些聊天记录的缓存，在电脑端占用的空间寸土寸金，却不让我十分珍惜，因为他们杂乱无章，脱离了微信就再也无法访问，偶尔同步最近记录还会抽风，语音同步也是个老大难问题，想要全量的聊天记录检索，必须搬出已经占用 10G 的手机微信。
想到前一阵子微信拟推出付费的聊天记录云端存储功能，以及越来越大的微信存储占用，我开始未雨绸缪，考虑谨慎处理我已经愈渐庞大和失控的微信数据。
定期的全量备份以建立保障
微信自带的备份和迁移
因为一直是 iPhone 用户，所以能够采取的备份方案一般也以官方的为主。下图这两个界面应该所有人都不陌生，电脑端提供的一直都是备份和恢复的操作，而如果是换手机的场景，也支持将设备连接到同一 WiFi，直接在手机间迁移聊天记录。这两个方案都能解决问题，但如果聊天记录过多的话，同步速度会不太可控。

说到手机间迁移聊天记录的场景，ColorOS、MIUI 等国内 Android 系统基本都支持微信数据的云端同步功能，部分 Android 系统还支持选择性恢复聊天记录，不仅对于聊天记录的留存多一份保障，还让随时可能过期的临时文件得以自动地存储下来。
相比而言，iOS 虽然也具备机器间数据整体的迁移功能，不过前提是需要借助电脑或 iCloud 云端同步来实现。需要说明的是，iCloud 的备份是对于 iOS 本地文件的「一锅端」，相比微信自带备份功能的缺点是只…]]></summary>

如今智能家居给我们的生活带来了很多便利，可以说是不用不知道，一用回不去。不少家电的操控也都是用嘴就能完成，甚至还能设置条件自动化执行。
对我自己而言，目前米家 app、Home Assistant 我都在同时使用，Home Assistant 主要用来弥补米家的一些不足，也避免自己被米家生态困住。但在 Home Assistant 下要实现语音控制却非常麻烦，除了要安装诸如天猫精灵之类的接入设备，后台设置也不简单。一番摸索之后想到用手机自带语音助手操控 Home Assistant 执行动作的思路，如此一来只需要一台旧手机（无论什么品牌，甚至没有自带语音助手都行）作为语音接入就能对智能家居进行控制，连天猫精灵、小米蓝牙音箱都省了。
不过需要通过语音助手实现的每一条动作，都必须单独创建一条自动化。如果你有类似的需求并且有时间动手，不妨跟随本文一起试试。
实现思路
我们需要用到的工具包括一部旧手机或旧平板、FV 悬浮球 或 通知滤盒，以及一台安装了 Home Assistant 的设备（要是你愿意折腾，Home Assistant 其实也可以一同装在旧手机中）。
执行思路如下：

Home Assistant 中预先创建自动化，触发条件设置为 webhook
手机通过语音助手识别我的语音命令
根据我的语音命令创建一条通知
通过 FV 悬浮球的自动任务或者通知滤盒获取该通知
根据通知内容发送对应 HTTP 请求到 Home Assistant
Home Assistant 收到发送的请求并执行对应自动化。

如果你是用的是 iOS 设备…]]></summary>

长期以来，Python 一直是最受欢迎的编程语言之一，但这并不意味着没有什么新东西可学。我们关于 Python 的阅读量最大的文章列表是一个很好的开始。


机器学习的广泛采用已经到来，其应用仍在增长。看看使用 朴素贝叶斯 分类器并通过 Python 实现的机器学习如何解决现实生活中的问题。

向 Python 3 的过渡已经完成，但增强功能不断涌现。Seth Kenlon 强调了 Python 3 中的五颗隐藏的宝石，它们在最近的改进中脱颖而出。

Openshot 多年来一直是 Linux 视频编辑的最佳选择之一。这篇受欢迎的文章将告诉你，你也可以用这个 Python 应用 在 Linux 上编辑视频。

Python 最好的部分是一个程序员可以实现的无限可能。Cython 是一个编译器，不仅可以帮助加快代码执行速度，还可以让用户为 Python 编写 C 语言扩展。

Python 可以使 API 单元测试更简单。Miguel Brito 向你展示了 用 Python 测试 API 的三种方法。

随着计算能力的提高，越来越多的程序在并发运行。这可能会使调试、日志记录和剖析出错的地方成为挑战。VizTracer 正是为了解决这个问题而创建的。

用户的个人项目，无论大小，都很好地提醒我们开源编码可以有无穷的乐趣。这里有一个鼓舞人心的项目：Darin London 如何使用 CircuitPython 监控他的温室。

Linux 用户经常会遇到需要大量命令行参数的程序，这让人很不爽。这是一个 不错的配置解析技巧，可以让生活更轻松。

However, designing a good event-driven architecture is quite challenging. We are familiar with the synchronization model, which request and response directly, but the stories are totally different in the asynchronization scheme. Nevertheless, here are some architecture patterns for reference.
The blueprint comes from the video and shows the whole vision on a well-defined event-driven architecture. 

I will briefly introduce those terminologies in the later sections.
The channel monitoring pattern define a role called channel monitor to watch the usage and utilization of the main queue. It monitors some metrics like the amount of pending messages, the amount of consumers and the consuming rate.

本周话题：前端与后端，谁更难？
"黑客新闻"（Hacker News）是美国最大的程序员社区，我每天都看，周刊的很多内容就来自那里。

有一天，我看到一个帖子。
一个前端程序员说，他不想干前端了，咨询大家意见，转到后端是否可行。
我从2007年开始从事前端开发，到了现在，很多新技术已经不擅长了。每次打开 Chrome 开发者工具，看到那些我不知道的新功能，我总是选择忽略。
很多我熟悉的工具和功能，都已经或将被弃用。现在的前端开发都在 npm 环境，经常有难懂的报错，好不容易搜到答案，又要花很多时间修复本地开发环境。
即使那些最简单的任务，现在的开发方式也比以前复杂，要考虑很多边界场景。我能够完成的工作，不断得缩小。
我失去了继续在前端工作的信心，转到后端，会不会容易一些。
简单说就是，他觉得前端越来越难，自己跟不上，无法坚持下去了。他想知道，后端会不会更容易一些，转成后端开发是否可行？

可以想象，讨论这种问题，一定是众说纷纭。
原帖下面，各种意见都有。支持的一方说，前端现在确实变得非常复杂，技术工具的更新速度太快，开发和维护的难度超过了后端。
反对的一方说，后端也很难，如果你适应不了 Node.js，改行写 C++/Java/Go 也会很痛苦，千万不要草率做决定。

难易是主观感受，没有办法精确衡量，人与人之间不可比较。所以我觉得，讨…]]></summary>

Markdown front matter makes it easy to add metadata to your content with information like tags, publish date, title, description, and more. Dev.to for example, uses Jekyll front matter for blog posts written on the platform.
If you're using a framework like Nuxt for Vue or Gatsby for React, you may have very specific properties you need in you front matter to ensure content renders the right way on your site. There are likely many ways to do this, but I've found that using VS Code snippets to store the block of front matter is an easy way to generate markdown files that are consistent with what my front end expects.

WebDriver, bir kullanıcının yerel olarak veya Selenium sunucusunu kullanan uzak bir makinede yapacağı gibi bir tarayıcıyı yerel olarak çalıştırır.
• WebDriver, basit ve daha özlü bir programlama arayüzü olarak tasarlanmıştır.
• WebDriver, kompakt bir nesne yönelimli API'dir.
Selenium, WebDriver'ı kullanarak piyasadaki tüm büyük tarayıcıların otomasyonunu destekler. WebDriver, web tarayıcılarının davranışını kontrol etmek için dilden bağımsız bir ara yüz tanımlayan bir API ve protokoldür. Her tarayıcı, sürücü adı verilen belirli bir WebDriver uygulaması tarafından desteklenir. Sürücü, tarayıcıya yetki vermekten sorumlu bileşendir ve Selenium ile tarayıcı arasındaki iletişimi yönetir.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bias for action is a principle that appears in many leadership principle lists of companies, like Amazon. Let us explore what it means and how software engineers apply this principle.
In business, time is money. Many judgments and acts can be reversed and do not need in-depth research. Risk-taking is something that is appreciated.
As software engineers, we have to take risks, decisions and need to judge decisions all the time. This depends of course on seniority and your current level, but in any job as a software engineer - even if you do not work at Amazon - you will show this principle.
The principle can also be described as a calculated risk. Not every decision will be the right one but with a bit of data, you can measure the risk of each option for doing a specific task. If the risk i…]]></summary>

I had never made a Figma plugin before but decided to look into it to see if I could build one to design UIs using hand movements.

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/829589"/>
        <updated>2022-01-20T19:25:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[fan88: 之前看了这篇文章，https://xinyuehtx.github.io/post/%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3NAT%E7%A9%BF%E8%B6%8A.html
上面介绍了常见的 NAT 类型，但我主要对 NAT 的穿透可行性有所疑问。
原文所属，端口受限型 NAT 与 端口受限型 NAT 之间是可以打洞的，但我认为不可行，或者说，应该不是完全可行的。

假如有两地 A ，B ； A （ 1.1.1.1 ），B （ 2.2.2.2 ）。
A 地内网主机 X(10.0.0.1)，B 地内网主机 Y(11.0.0.2)
按照他的说法，我们可以先连上一个公网节点 C ，C 可以得知 A 、B 实际公网地址，随后要求 X 主机(10.0.0.1) 向 B 的公网(2.2.2.2)发包，10.0.0.1:4000 映射为 1.1.1.1:1001  向 2.2.2.2:8000 发送数据包（在这里 8000 端口应该是可以任意的）。
那么此时，2.2.2.2:8000 可以与 1.1.1.1:1001 通信。 但是问题是，B 地内网主机 Y （ 11.0.0.2 ），与 10.0.0.1:4000 发送数据包通信时，路由器不一定映射为 2.2.2.2:8000 ，有可能映射为 2.2.2.2:1234 与 1.1.1.1:1001 进行通信，此时 A 地路由器由于端口不一致则会拒绝接受数据包。
因此，以上场景中只有当 B 地路由器分配主机 Y （ 11.0.0.2 ）与 1.1.1.1:1001 通信的端口恰好为 8000 时，才可能实现穿透吧。
可能我的理解有误，希望大家积极指正，谢谢！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[0 写在最前面
2021年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔1-2年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在16至25岁间萌出，此时人的生理、心理发育都接近成熟，有“智慧到来”的象征，因此被俗称为“智齿”。智齿生长方面，个体有很大差异，通常情况下应该有上下左右对称的4颗牙，有的少于4颗甚至没有，极少数人会多于4颗。萌出的年龄差异也很大，有的人20岁之前萌出，有人40到50岁才长或者终生不长，这都是正常现象。1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[wsrlyk: 别的方面可能还有，不过我感受最深的还是标签页管理和工具栏，涉及单手操作的方面。
 本来我以为是不是老外真的手很大，无所谓这些操作按钮放哪里，就沿袭 PC 的设计思路，放在上面。那虽然我用着很难受，但也是能理解了。
 但最近一看，不对啊，Safari 已经把地址栏挪到下面了，Firefox 我看也挪了。那说明他们还是地球人的手咯，和很多国人没太大的区别。
  
但这些已经挪了地址栏和菜单栏的浏览器，为啥标签页管理还是从左上角开始排列…………我在下方点击按钮打开标签页管理，依然要单手费劲或用另外一只手点击最上面一排来关闭。这个好像 Safari 还开倒车？ 以前我记得它的标签页是从下往上排列的，手指上下划就可以轻松定位到某个标签。现在也改成了左上角排列……
 chrome 和 edge 更是把我整笑了。当我把所有标签都关了之后，浏览器的状态就基本上卡死了，除非我手动额外点一下“打开一个新的标签页”……………… 那麻烦你能不能帮我自动打开一个。edge 还贴心地写上“若要浏览 web ，请添加新的标签页”，不然呢……不浏览 web 我用你干啥呢……
 Firefox 之前没怎么用过，现在用下来算是相对好点的。先用段时间试试。
 国产手机的那些自带浏览器，虽然广告新闻啥的眼花缭乱，但这些操作体验还是秒杀 chrome 。
 但我电脑上的 cent 是基于谷歌同步，手机上用别的一些小众浏览器就没了同步这一块，也是比较麻烦。
 所以这些操作习惯到底是我的特色还是天朝特色还是啥，你们会觉得不好用么]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是自定义短语
macOS 与 iOS 中的键盘设置中，都有 【自定义短语】这个功能。
这个功能有什么用呢，可以很方便的输入平时常用的一些词条，比如你的住址，或邮箱。
该功能是这样的，定义一个输入码比如 mail 定义它的替换文本为 kylebingbing@163.com，这样，在你输入 mail 的时候就会被自动替换成你的邮箱。
macOS 中是这样的
 

iOS 中是这样的
 

macOS 与 iOS 的键盘中的自定义短语是同步的。所以在 macOS 上导入的短语也会出现在同账号下的 iOS 系统中。
我的需求
我是五笔用户，iOS上用的是原生的五笔输入法，但这个输入法有个问题，就是词库无法自定义，所以我就瞄准了输入法中的这个 【自定义短语】功能。我需要往里导入非常多的词几百几千或几万，一个一个加是不可能了。
上面我们已经知道 macOS 与 iOS 的自定义短语是同步的，所以只需要在 macOS 上导入词条就可以了，幸运的是 macOS 是可以批量导入的。
一、自定义短语的位置
macOS

打开键盘设置
切换标签到 自定义短语
往里面添加就可以了

iOS

打开设置
打开 【通用设置】
找到【键盘】
再点击【自定义短语】

二、如何导入导出词条
批量导入导出词条只能在 macOS 中操作
1. 导出

打开自定义短语的窗口
command + a 选中所有词条，
然后拖动这些词条到桌面，即可导出词条到桌面，此时会生成一个 .plist 的文件，其文件的内容格式如下






phrase
kylebing@163.com
shortcut
mail


phrase
自定义短语
shortcut
tpyy




观察这个文件结构可以看到它是由 phrase 和 shortcut 两个字段组成的。
2. 导入
你可以上面的文件结构生成自己的 .plist 文件。
导入的方法跟导出正好相反，直接拖动 .plist 文件到 自定义短语的窗口中即可，系统还会自动查重。
三、批量处理词条的工具
工具地址：https://github.com/KyleBing/wubi-dict-editor
介绍一下我做的一个可以批量处理词条的工具。它可以将批量词条生成到一个 plist 文件中，直接拖动导入到自定义短语中就可以了。
比如我有这些词条需要导入，目前只有 编码-短语 这种结构，需要生成 .plist 那种 xml 结构

只需要选中需要导入的词条，点击 【导出为 .plist 文件】即可

只需要拖动生成的文件到自定义短语的窗口中，即可完成批量导入

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人在北京，开过上百款车，自己分别有前驱SUV、后驱轿车和电动车，聊聊经验。
东北有句老话：一猪二熊三老虎。不是真的说野猪的战斗力秒杀东北虎，而是人遇到野猪，往往不如遇到老虎那么害怕，结果被野猪挑死了。
按照不同天气，对应的警惕程度应该是这样的顺序：
雪天＜雨天＜雨夹雪＜冷雾
雪天好说，地上都白了，是个智商正常的都知道该慢，提高预判警醒着开。雨天要比雪天更小心，因为车速高了之后，轮胎会与地面之间形成一层薄薄的水膜，导致附着力大幅下降，但很多人开车的时候有种操蛋的逻辑，感觉破水而行很爽，甚至故意加速压水坑，要是赶上单侧轮胎水坑里踩油门，那就离失控不远了。
所以相比下雪，雨天更应该提高警惕。
接下来是雨夹雪，这种情况就像过地雷阵，很难判断前方路面到底是水，还是冰层，还是冰水混合物。雨夹雪最可怕的是，不像雪天那样，司机会一直保持警惕。很多司机遇到雨夹雪，刚一开始心里还挺紧张，聚精会神，越开心里越放松。车速提升、预判变短，甚至回到常规驾驶习惯，以至于前方车辆减速时，自己的车刚好处于冰水混合的路面，只能眼看着爆前车菊。
我曾经跑高速，真实的经历告诉我，最可怕的天气是冷雾，为什么呢？冷雾一般发生在深夜和凌晨，诱因大概是某个区域短时间内气温骤降，导致瞬间起了大雾。雾天开车各位都知道该怎么操作吧？打开前后雾灯，慢速行驶，非必要不开双闪。
但突发性的冷雾，大家都把注意力放在视线上了，却漏掉了一个特别重大的危险隐患——路面凝水/结霜。这种情况比雨夹雪形成的暗冰更可怕，因为在深夜凌晨，路面是否凝水结霜几乎没法分辨，这时候一脚刹车下去，如果是结霜路面，车辆特别容易启动ABS和EBD，一些经验不足的司机就慌了，因为这种表现和他们的心理预期极不相符：
不就是下雾了么，为什么刹不住车了？
经验不够的司机这时候就特别容易慌，从而出现乱打方向等谜之操作，进而导致事故。
最后附上我很久以前经历并总结的一次道路结冰导致七车连追事故：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[澳本聪要求比特币开发者重写区块链，以找回他的加密货币

一位被俗称为“澳本聪”的人声称自己是比特币创造者，他说他的比特币私钥在 2020 年被黑客删除了。现在他正在起诉 Bitcoin SV（BSV）的开发者们，希望迫使他们“重写或修改底层软件代码”，让他获得他“拥有但无法访问”的价值 1400 万英镑的 BSV。Bitcoin SV 是 Bitcoin（BTC）的一个分叉。他声称丢失的私钥除了可以控制这些 BSV，还可以控制对应的比特币，总价值高达 45 亿美元。这 15 名被告包括比特币博客作者“比特币耶稣”、BSV 比特币协会等比特币核心的开发人员。


老王点评：能修改的区块链，亏他能想得出来。不过这人就是一个讼棍，意不在真的修改，而是利用诉讼达成另外的目的。




工厂雇佣机器人员工

芝加哥南部的一家生产金属铰链、锁具和支架的工厂已经经营了上百年，去年为了在人工短缺的情况下满足不断增长的需求，雇佣 了第一位机器人员工。这个“机器人”是一只机械臂，执行一项简单的重复性工作：将一块金属放到冲压机里，后者随后将其弯曲成新的形状。和人一样，机器工人按照工作时间获得报酬。这位雇佣或者说租来的机器人的成本相当于每小时 8 美元，而人类员工的最低工资为每小时 15 美元。


老王点评：如果说是租来的，感觉还没那么强烈，但是如果说是雇佣，这种机器人抢走人类工作的感觉非常明显了。而对工厂来说，其实没有区别。




一半的医院联网设备容易受到黑客攻击

根据一份报告，医院中使用的互联网连接设备有一半以上 存在漏洞，可能会危及病人安全、机密数据或设备的可用性。该报告分析了全球 300 多家医院和医疗机构的 1000 多万台设备的数据。医院里最常见的互联网连接设备类型是输液泵。这些设备可以远程连接到电子医疗记录，提取正确剂量的药物或其他液体，并将其分配给病人。报告发现，输液泵是最有可能存在可被黑客利用的漏洞的设备，73% 的该类设备存在漏洞。


老王点评：在享受联网便利的同时，安全没有跟上带来的风险更大。]]></summary>

1 、能养狗（成年金毛）
2 、小区能停车包月（ 600 内）
3 、能办居住证最好
4 、能长租一年以上最好
5 、整租一室户租金 5K 左右（合租、两室等情况酌情）
6 、早上 9 点出发 1 小时驾车通勤，非沪牌，工作地点分别在徐家汇、龙华中路
（大致看过徐汇华泾、闵行浦江、闵行七宝、浦东三林、松江莘闵等）
我找过哪些平台：
自如：整租偏贵，合租养宠物不方便
贝壳（链家）：房源比较正规，挂牌价稍稍偏高，有一定还价余地，找经纪人聊天会给你一些外网没有的房源
XX 公寓类：商业水电，人群流动大
太平洋 /中原 /我爱我家：参考链家，但是房源质量都比较差，虚假信息较多，与链家相同的房源挂牌价会低一点
暖房：信息主要来自豆瓣、58 ，转租为主，很多人转租二房东和公寓的房源
六六：需要手工勾选业主直租、个人转租，否则全是二房东，非二房东的房源较少
巴乐兔：中介模块做的乱七八糟；个人转租信息看着价格都挺低的，有合适的可以联系
二房东：续租涨价现象严重，隔断房环境一般
我遇到的困难：
主要是养宠物+车位长租的问题，直接 pass 掉 90%的房源
本来想去外环附近租个别墅然后找室友，后来想想能负担 5K+的一般都市区整租了
如果各位有相关资源，或周围的朋友有相关房源，欢迎介绍下]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[李想最近在微博上很活跃。
2022 年 1 月 11 日的下午，李想在理想汽车内部一个主动安全主题的飞书群看到了一个懂车帝的视频链接，视频的标题很长：「2021 年度新能源、AEB、性能车型及发动机评选」，但对于李想来说，题眼无非是 3 个字母：AEB。
AEB，全称 Autonomous Emergency Braking，自动紧急制动系统。在车辆行驶的过程中，如果有追尾的风险，但驾驶员又没踩刹车亦或是踩了但力度不够，都会触发 AEB，大力制动以避免追尾。
在刚刚过去的 2021 年，懂车帝测试了超过 100 款车的 AEB，测试的项目纷繁复杂，既有儿童鬼探头、隧道 AEB，也有消失的前车、50% 追尾，这些测试远远超出了全球各国的碰撞安全评测机构布置的「考题」，以更加贴合中国交通场景的测试对 AEB 进行极限考验。
那支视频的结论是：2021 款理想 ONE 打败了进入前五的华晨宝马 5 系、华晨宝马 X3、斯巴鲁傲虎和沃尔沃 XC60，成为懂车帝 2021 年 AEB 测试表现最好的车型。
几个小时后，李想发微博表达了对智能驾驶团队的认可：「自从能够开展全栈自研以后，团队在算法和控制的进步速度远远超过了我的想象」。
对于李想，乃至理想汽车这家公司来说，这无疑是一场小小的胜仗。尤其是考虑到就在一年前的 2020 年 12 月底，理想才和视觉感知供应商 Mobileye 分手，站在一穷二白从头来的白纸前。
为什么是理想？
一切都要回到一年前的那个年底。和 Mobileye 一年多来的合作已经让理想「忍无可忍」：这家从以色列起步的视觉感知供应商以其高效、可靠的算法敲开了诸多主流汽车制造商的大门，其中也包括年轻的理想汽车，但因为其高度封闭的合作策略，理想汽车在收集到用户端反馈的一些 Bug 后，却不被允许基于 Mobileye 的算法基础进行持续的迭代开发，以修复这些 Bug…]]></summary>

但用 wireshark 试着抓了一下本地接口上的包，发现有 ip 绕过了路由直连。后来发现，这个 ip 应该是 connectivity-check.ubuntu.com 的 ip （ 35.224.170.84 ）。上网搜了一下，应该是 NetworkManager 发起的。
我检查过 ip rule ，只有默认的几个规则和路由表。并且我自己 ping 了一下 35.224.170.84 ，wireshark 并抓不到 icmp 包（因为按理说，这个 ip 该走的是 vpn 接口再从本地接口发送出去，所以在本地接口上是看不到的），所以路由规则应该没错，而是被某种方式绕过了。比较好奇，NetworkManager 是通过什么方式绕开了系统的路由的？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言
作为一个普通人，在使用 iPhone 的将近 14 年时间里，Due 陪伴我走过了 6 年多的时间。并且在这 6 年多的时间里，看着很多人从 OminiFocus 用到 Things，而它牢牢霸占了我首屏上的一个固定位置，就像已经「刻」在那里了一样。
普通人的效率，也可以没那么复杂。
一、我与 GTD 的初遇
梦回 2014 年的年初，正在公车通勤路上的我，在播客上听到了《狗熊有话说》的主播，@i 大狗熊 的一期关于 GTD 理论的介绍，大概意思是，关于 OmniFocus 这款时间管理应用程序的使用心得，将任务根据紧急、重要程度，分到四个象限进行归类，方便在日后进行任务管理时快速拾取，规划并掌控自己的时间，高效工作、生活。
男人至死是少年，iPhone 对我来说就是一款随身「小霸王」，玲琅满目的 App 便是各种陈列在街头拐角游戏商店中的「卡带」，而这类兼具效率和格调的 App 则犹如卡带界的「记忆卡」，令我向往和着迷。
听了这期播客之后，我便开始规划起了自己的时间管理之路，憧憬着自己掌控时间、掌控命运、升职加薪的美好未来。于是我打开 App Store，搜索关键字 OmniFocus，新鲜感带着肾上腺素刺激着我的交感神经，哪怕现在用自己的流量下载，我也要立刻得到它！
想必接下来的事情大家都能猜到，阻碍在我面前的不是那一点点流量的问题，而是熟悉的下载按钮变成了一个三位数数字，258 元。对于刚毕业找到工作的我来说，这在当时约等于我十多天的伙食费了。即便已经有了挺强的付费意识，但面对这么一个不能试用的、昂贵到甚至于可以说是数字奢侈品的东西，我先是胆怯，而后开始思考，我的生活场景中，真的有这么复杂的应用场景吗？
为了探寻这个问题，我开始对 GTD 思想进行深入了解，之后结合自身实际场景，付费购买了几款价格略能接受的 App 去做实际体验，如 Clear 等，实际体验了几…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我喜欢这句话，“我们无权评论别人的人生，同理别人也不可以。”
肯定有许多人会过来阴阳怪气，“那可真是无权”（评论区果为如此，承认自己可能是特别难的一件事）。
不患人之不己知，患其不能也。
因为没有人能够比事主自己更了解自己，所以没法评价人生；对于同理，假装情绪去“可怜或者怜惜”我觉得想必都是虚伪的：不知他人苦，无法同理。
在不违法的前提下，做任何事情都是自己的自由，网间相传的事情，狗头萝莉这样一位主播何尝不是类似于“陈冠希门”一般的受害者呢？
关于早年的猥亵和强奸，既然已经在网上公开，不妨报警，众所周知，无论猥亵还是强奸如果要走法律程序，那么其重点就是证据。想要证明犯罪事实，至少要有以下核心证据中的几个形成证据体系：

医院病历以及报告单（可能非常不容易取到，时间已经相隔太久）
被告人的供述以及辩解（有大概率可以取得）
受害人的陈述以及辨认笔录（确凿取得）
案发现场勘验检查笔录以及照片（难以取得）
能够证明双方是否发生性关系的精斑检验鉴定意见书（难以取得）
能够证明被告人是否采取暴力、胁迫或其他手段以威吓受害人的证人证言（可能可以取得）
能够证明受害人是否曾通过微信、短信和电话等方式向外传递求救信息的证人证言（刑事侦查可以恢复电子数文）
能够证明受害人是否存在反抗、胁迫等迹象的案发现场（酒店入口、走廊）监控视频

在以上证据的采集上，毋庸置疑，警方是十分专业的。然而由于本事件自发生到报警，时间间隔已经较长了，部分证据的取得可能难度颇大，不过在知乎依旧怀有热情的时代，我想会有无数愿意给予协助帮助的人。
当然，关于刑事方面的建议我还是更为推荐去做专业咨询（我只能大体给一点点提示，这不是我擅长的领域，可以咨询两位女律师 @黄小牛 @王逸然 ）。
关于高额违约金，涉及违约要付出的成本，让狗头萝莉背上高额违约金的原因是合同约定发生根本性违约时应当支付高额违约金——这件事情愿打愿挨，没有什么办法。
虽然都说，违约金，性质上以补偿性为主，惩罚性为辅。
但实际里面，无论是法院判决还是仲裁，其实都会基于会综合考虑实际损失、履行情况、过错程度、预期利益等因素，并根据公平和诚实信用原则进行认定。
其中会重点考虑主播的知名程度、主播的主观过错、平台对主播培养和人气维系的情况、平台基于连续性合同履行所产生的预期利益损失。
从合作之初，其实甲方设计来说，本就是律师通过精巧的合同设计来约束主播，而主播的行为被装进款式多样的违约套餐中。
稍有不慎，就会触发高额索赔。
纵然知道违约金很高，然而主播还是得签：无他，双方地位本来初始就不平等。
当然，对于类似虎牙平台的资源倾斜来说（一个主播很多时候都是资源堆出来的），确实也具有设置高额违约金的必要性。
以主播韦朕8522万天价违约金案为例，裁判机构一般会认为直播作为新兴产业具有较强的行业特点，直播平台对主播依赖性较强且行业间竞争激烈，平台经营者需要投入大量人力物力进行主播的推广和人气维系，顶级主播的直播间观看人数和粉丝数量对平台利益具有重大隐形关联。
当然我想最开始签约的时候，狗头萝莉甚至不能完全理解合约对于自身的限制程度（比如私德条款之类纵然明星都不了解，何况一个游戏主播）。
可是她既然在网络上说了她的过往，我想从法律上也许不是她不懂，而是已经失去了心气，这个时候的她，依旧还希望有人会倾泻予她以阳光。
想起有个KWM的姑娘很善良，前天转过来她直播时候的视频，并评论“唏嘘于人生的不同，但是可以从泫然欲泪里感受不甘，以及无法脱身”。
面包和牛奶都会有的，要振作起来，自己可以拯救自己，做一个你曾经想要成为的，能给大家带来更多美好的人吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是《画江湖之不良人》第五季的导演兼半拉编剧，李帅帅。（开场白直接扒的舒导，实在太难想了！）
犹记得当初舒导被市场的大佬们围在会议室写知乎的窘境，犹记得我叼着烟嘲笑的嘴脸，犹记得市场大佬那略有深意的回眸现在回想起来让我倍感深刻。



在唠些有营养的之前，请容我唠叨两句，谁叫你们给我吐槽的机会呢~
时间回溯到不良人4播出之时，在4收获不错的口碑背后，大家不知道的是我们透支了什么，公司开始动荡，而我，正准备离职。就在这个时候，关导和舒导找到了我。
对面是劈着大腿的关导，一旁是面色苍白挂着诡异笑容的舒导。
关：“帅啊，你来导不良人5吧。”
我：“哦，啊？”
这时办公室门开了，端着茶杯的周导走到我身后，吐了口茶叶。
周：“别怕，我带你。”
我：“我…”
周：“哦对了，是5和6啊。”
那个时候我早就知道做原创动画不赚钱，但是我更想不明白的是这帮人从几十人干到四百多人又掉到一百多人……还tm搞原创，这不疯了吗？
后来我明白了，凤凰啊，是需要涅槃的。
就这样，我接过了接力棒，是整体制作周期缩减一半的不良人5、6。
你们看我说的挺热血，真到开干的时候，真的太难了。首先的难题就是人员配置，动荡期我们流失了大量第4季的班底，为了增强画质我们还换了新流程，这让整个项目充满了大量的不确定性，我们要在更短的周期内，不断试错，同时还要保持制作水准。就这样，我还将画幅提升到了21:9，为此制片部门还开了大会。
翁总监：“ 21:9 ，代价是什么？”
我：“（小心翼翼）拍到的东西会更多，但是画面会更有张力，更贴近电影，更能凸显我们的画质，增强沉浸感blablabla……”
在座鸦雀无声，我艹我当时紧张的不行。
翁总监：“艹，干了！”
首当其冲的就是资产，新流程下，我们以前的所有资产积累都需要更新，没有一样可以直接用（感谢大个儿和小倩，资产组一度就八个人，兄弟们太难了）。尽管如此，我们还要更进一步…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drafts 是一款著名的文本效率工具，它早已成为了众多 Power User 的主屏应用。伴随着 Drafts 5 的更新，相比起 Drafts 4 有了很多的功能升级，所以也有必要写篇新文章来介绍一下它。对我个人而言，使用 Drafts 配合 URL Scheme，几乎能够链接所有个人使用的应用。例如 OmniFocus、Bear 以及一系列支持 URL Scheme 搜索的应用。接下来就来一起看看，Drafts 的功能逐一介绍。
新建草稿
多种新建草稿方式
Drafts 支持多种方式新建草稿，最基本的方式就是打开软件之后，就可以直接输入文本编写草稿。如果你打算只用来记录灵感，那 Drafts 两个最基本的功能点开即记录、飞快启动的功能点就可以满足你。但如果你想拿来当闪念胶囊、处理 PDF 文字，Drafts 也一样也可以满足你。
在刚接触 Drafts 的时候，部分用户可能会发现，有时候打开 Drafts 是停留在之前的草稿，但是也有出现一个新的草稿。其实这是 Drafts 的一个功能，它会在每次退出 Drafts 之后开始计时，只有达到了一定的时间之后，再进入 Drafts 才会变成新建草稿。如果需要修改这个计时时间，可以点击编辑页面的右下角的「⚙️」，进入 Drafts 设置页面，修改「New draft after」的时间，从最短的 30秒到不创建新草稿，多个时间选项可供选择。

除了打开软件就会自动新建草稿之外，还可以点击草稿左上角的「+」就可以新建草稿，而长按就可以跳出选项菜单。提供了更多的新建草稿的方式，例如从剪切板、选择文段、听写输入等。

导入 PDF
如果有提取 PDF 中文字的需求，最常见的做法可能就是使用 OCR 软件，识别文字并复制。但是在 Drafts 最近的一次更新中，支持了从 PDF 中提取文字生成草稿。以下图中的一份 PDF 文档为例，…]]></summary>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

早在 2017 年，我便萌生了写一篇读书总结文章的念头，那一年是我开始大规模读书的第一年，在那之前不过是每年读个三五本书。至今我都记得 2017 年第一本读完的书是《杀死一只知更鸟》，但到现在，书里的人物、剧情全然忘却，只记得那是一本有关教养与教化的书籍。
五年过去了，每年我都能读完至少三四十本书，可如今再翻看那些书单，大多数书籍都和《知更鸟》一样，在记忆中没有留下什么痕迹。于是在今年，我开始了写读书笔记的计划，长篇大论也好、三五句也行。我在读完一本书时，趁着记忆还没消散，就把杂想随想写下，在今后随时翻阅时希冀能回想起什么。也因如是，才有了这一篇总结文章。
每一天，我都会在夜晚睡觉前，躺在床上捧着 Kindle 读半小时书再入睡。从去年底开始我用上了专注计时工具，来摒除手机对专注阅读的影响。因为不知道哪款软件更趁手，索性同时使用了 iHour 和 OffScreen 来专注计时。到如今打开 App 看统计数据，今年的累计阅读时间已经超过 227 小时了。
我们常常高估一天能做成的事，却往往低估一年能做的事。

除了睡前阅读，偶尔我也会在通勤地铁里、出差飞机上，还有咖啡店里读书。本文中的所有图片都是这一年我在杭州咖啡探店时拍摄的，衷心感谢杭州精品咖啡店提供的美味咖啡☕️。
《怎样才能不杀死你的植物》
《怎样才能不杀死你的植物》 是我在 1 月份读完的，这本书对于我而言是家养绿植的启蒙书。在我读完这本书之后先后养起了龟背竹、富贵竹、琴叶榕、牛油果这四类植物…]]></summary>

有个老梗：“正经人谁写日记？下贱！”
虽然是句调侃，但确实让不少人对写日记这件事情生畏和误解。生畏，是把写日记当成羞耻，生怕被人发现；误解，是以为写日记就是自我内心世界的描绘，和不可告人的秘密。
其实，凡是喜欢写所谓“走心” 日记的，往往是三天打鱼两天晒网的人。能让你坚持写一生的日记，一定不是靠情绪和修辞构建出来的，而是由事件组成的。
真正的日记，写的不是瞬息万变的情绪，也不是无病呻吟的自虐剖析，而是忠实记录某个时间，发生了某件与己相关的事，仅此而已。
所以，只有不正经的人才羞于将自己的经历记录下来，咱正经人，写个日记，堂堂正正，坦坦荡荡，有什么可害臊的呢？

所谓日记，一言以蔽之，就是按照时间顺序所书写的个人经历记录，就是与时间不同的“自己”这个“别人”进行的笔谈
——《智识的生产技术》，梅棹忠夫

接下来，咱们进入正题，讲3件事：

为什么要写日记？
为什么要用writeathon写日记？
如何用writeathon写日记？

一 | 为什么要写日记？
季羡林日记
如果用一个形象的比喻，来揭示日记与记录者的关系的话，可以这样认为：

日记是一座个人的档案馆。

为什么这么说呢？
人的记忆是非常不可靠的，它既疯狂遗忘，又肆意拼凑。如果我们在事件发生时，不留下实体的信息，仅仅靠自己的记忆来形成对真实世界的印象，无疑将是变形和残缺的。
而通过写日记，将我们在线性时间旅程中的经历，变成不同时间节点的信息沉淀下来，就构建了我们的个人档案馆，是对人生的真实备份。
我们通过一张张的时间切片，不仅可以看到结果，还能追溯其真实发生的过程，从而获得更多对未来的启发。
如果说三维世界是高维世界的投影，那么日记就是我们三维人所能掌握的一种对高维世界的透视技巧。
通过日记建立个人档案馆，我们可以在一定程度上摆脱三…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“您平时身体好吗？”“身体好的很，从来没生过病。”“您这牙之前疼过吗？”“疼过。”“那这不是生过病吗？”“这可算不上病吧。”“您可别小看这牙痛，您现在这问题就是牙痛没有及时处理导致的，需要手术治疗了。”“这么严重啊。”“那可不，可别不把牙痛不当病啊。”

这样的对话，在如今的口腔门诊上，屡见不鲜。随着社会发展、物质富足，人们糖摄取量明显增多，食物越来越精细，生活压力越来越大，相应的，口腔问题（包括但远不仅限于牙痛）也如影随形。然而，好好刷牙并非包治百病，贵的牙膏并不会比便宜的牙膏有更好的效果，口腔卫生知识的缺失，让很多人忽视本该处理的口腔问题，错过最佳的治疗机会，延误病情，带来更为严重的后果。这篇文章中，我希望能够通过简单易懂的方式，一次性给你说清楚看牙这个问题。
口腔医生究竟能看哪些疾病？
每种医生都有自己的管辖范围，这个范围在各国之间可能都存在差异。去到医院，看到“琳琅满目”的科室和医生列表，你是否也曾疑惑过，我究竟应该挂哪个科？
中国的口腔医生，可不只会看牙。
在中国，口腔医生这个职业，和美国的 dentist（A dentist is a person who is qualified to examine and treat people's teeth.）是有明显区别的，这个区别具体就体现在诊疗范围上。现代中国口腔医学的体系，脱胎于前苏联，除了dentist涉及的范围（主要就是口腔及牙齿）外，还包括口腔颌面外科的内容。也就是说，口腔医生中，有一类是外科医生，也就是大家眼里那种会上手术台，会拿手术刀的医生。
大半个头都归口腔医生管。
头，这样一个全身最为精密的部位，医学上也分工明确。有头发覆盖的区域（颅骨+大脑），归神经外科管辖，但注意，请不要使用现有的发量去进行判断，这可能会导致不准确的结论，同时头发和头皮的问题，可能需要咨询皮肤科的医生（我不说是什么问题）。眼…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京市疾病预防控制中心
12月23日，国务院新闻办公室举行新闻发布会，介绍北京冬奥会和冬残奥会疫情防控政策及相关筹备工作。北京市卫生健康委员会副主任、新闻发言人李昂就如何做好北京冬奥医疗救治保障工作回答了记者提问。


李昂表示，北京市按照《奥运会指南—医疗服务》和《国际雪联医疗保障指南》要求，本着“简约、安全、精彩”办赛理念，按照精准、安全、高效的分类施治策略，做好冬奥医疗救治保障，重点开展了四个方面的工作：
一是完善了医疗救治资源配置。在竞赛场馆设置固定医疗站、比赛场地医疗站、观众医疗站等，北京赛区和延庆赛区共设置88个医疗站，提供现场医疗急救及伤病员分流转运工作。从17家定点医院和2家院前急救机构选拔1140名医疗骨干作为场馆医疗保障人员，配置457名院级后备力量；从12家三级医院抽选120名医护人员组建市级后备队；配备场馆救护车74辆，其中负压救护车54辆。按照冬奥疫情防控政策要求，协同北京冬奥组委将涉冬奥伤病员分为新冠肺炎确诊与疑似患者、闭环内的发热症状患者、闭环内其他伤病员、闭环外的发热症状患者、闭环外其他伤病员等五类，调整优化定点医院收治任务，18家定点医院实施精准分类收治，避免不同风险伤病员流线交叉。赛时将从定点医院抽调1188名医务人员、840名院内专家，提供及时、高效的医疗服务，同时，60名市级专家、10名院士给予高水平技术支持。
二是制定了“一场一策”和“一院一策”医疗保障方案。针对每一场所比赛运动损伤特点，专门配备了骨科、口腔科等学科医务人员。同时，在冰球场馆增配CT、牙椅等设备，结合场所环境特点，开展有针对性的现场急救演练，实现“一场一策”医疗保障。为发挥专业学科优势，提高医疗救治能力，定点医院制定了“一院一策”医疗保障方案，北京大学第三医院延庆医院将1.2万平方米的独立病房楼改建为冬奥医疗中心，设置72张病床，配套CT和核磁等设备、手术室、核酸采样、发热门诊等；北京安贞医院腾退104张床位改造为冬奥专区；北京大学人民医院、北京朝阳医院、北京世纪坛医院等调整院内布局，设置病房专区，配备专用CT、核磁等设备，建设负压杂交手术室，为冬奥医疗救治提供有力保障。
三是加强了冬奥村综合诊所建设。建成了1500平方米的北京冬奥村综合诊所和1658平方米的延庆冬奥村综合诊所，覆盖急诊、理疗康复、影像、中医、牙科等18个学科，满足赛时每日16 小时基本门诊和24小时紧急救治需求。目前，北京冬奥村综合诊所医疗设备调试已完成；延庆冬奥村综合诊所CT、核磁、DR方舱已调试到位，保证赛时急诊、门诊、康复转院等医疗救治工作有序开展。
四是强化了培训演练和血液保障。按照全员培训、内外结合原则，加大医疗保障人员冬奥知识、英语水平、滑雪技能等内容培训，40名滑雪医生达到国际救援水平，1900名医疗保障人员具备基础急救能力。市红十字血液中心建立赛时调血机制，Rh阴性血液持续保持在1800～2000单位。
北京市将统筹全市医疗资源，全力做好冬奥会、冬残奥会医疗救治保障工作，为各国运动员和国际友人提供优质高效的医疗救治保障。

冬奥会的到来，不仅让更多的孩子感受到冰雪运动的乐趣，更为孩子们树立了新的奋斗目标。

在南京奥体中心，就有这样一群孩子，即使懵懵懂懂，却对未来能站上冬奥赛场充满期待。

    从黑龙江省七台河市走出的世界冠军张杰，是两届世界大冬会女子3000米接力冠军队成员，曾在短道速滑世锦赛中打破世界纪录。
↑这是张杰参加1991年世界短道速滑锦标赛的资料照片。新华社发
    2014年，张杰回到家乡七台河，利用学习多年的运动康复技能组建了一支由残障孩子组成的短道速滑队，不拿薪金，义务执教。

    这支由残障孩子组成的短道速滑队成员曾在2017年第11届世界冬季特奥会的速度滑冰项目中斩获4金2银，又在2019年第15届世界夏季特奥会的速度轮滑项目中获得3金2银2铜的好成绩。

    世界冠军培养出了世界冠军。对此，张杰却说，金牌不重要，只要孩子们收获快乐就好。
    从七台河出发，张杰在赛场上为国争光。荣誉加身，她又为爱折返，为“折翼天使”插上梦想的翅膀，成为家乡冰雪运动“火种”的播撒者。“我所有的快乐、幸福和人生感悟都是滑冰带给我的，滑冰是我的全部。”张杰说。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[去年当爹了，说实话哪怕1个孩子，我都觉得自己的轿车空间有些捉襟见肘。带娃家庭对于空间的需求提升，远不止一个座位+儿童安全座椅那么简单，而是伴娃左右的各种杂七杂八，都得有地方妥妥安置。
我就想，以后三胎家庭越来越多，要应付3个孩子的日常出行，这样的SUV有吗？于是我罗列了大家庭SUV的实用条件：

绝对空间一定要够；
相对空间，也就是内部灵活性必须有，能让车主自己组合布局；
人性化设计，包括按键布局、随手就能利用的储物格等等，很考验厂商的用户思维；
在满足以上三点的基础上，车辆的智能化也可以为出行提供便利，这项并非强求。


离家不远就有很多4S店，带着这些需求，我“假模假式”探访了一波，结果被一款即将上市的新车按住了，它就是一汽－大众旗舰SUV——揽境。这款车指导价为29.99~39.99万元，不到30万就能入手的德系大块头，值得细细品味！

而且我发现，这次一汽-大众为揽境邀请的品牌代言人于和伟，从某种程度上讲与车辆的定位十分契合。于和伟属于可塑性很高的演技派，从《大宅门》里吐口水的白占安，到《新三国》里“接着奏乐接着舞”的刘备，戏路实在是广。反过来看，揽境是定位于大家庭兼商务的全能旗舰SUV，于和伟站在揽境旁边，显然可以突出后者的全能属性——力图满足客户所有用车场景。

绝对空间 | 随便折腾！

这家店有两台揽境，一台作为展车摆在显眼的位置，另一台即将办好上路手续。一汽-大众的店员很热情，把车洗好了让我独自享受！时间有限，我马上按照大家庭SUV的使用条件，一项一项“折腾”起来。
一汽-大众揽境 前两排空间展示
首先是前排空间，调整好坐姿后，身高1.68米的我头部距离车顶尚有两拳距离。这是在我意料之中的，因为揽境的车身高度接近1.8米，对于身高1.9米以下的人来说都是完全够用的。

保持驾驶位座椅不变，来到第二排。揽境采用2+2+2的6座布局形式，且全系可以选装7座。这…]]></summary>

使用 # 添加注释

随着脚本变得愈加复杂和实用，我们需要添加注释，以便记住程序在做什么。如果与其他人分享你的脚本，注释也将帮助他们理解思考过程，以及更好理解你的脚本实现的功能。想一想上篇文章中的数学方程，我们在新版脚本中添加了一些注释。注意，在 learnToScript.sh 文件（如下所示）中，注释是前面带有 # 号的行。当脚本运行时，这些注释行并不会出现。

#!/bin/bash

#Let's pick up from our last article. We

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

上一篇文章我们对肥胖的标准、产生的原因、不良影响及如何树立正确减脂观等几方面内容进行了分析，本篇我们从「吃」入手。
我们常听人说减脂「七分吃，三分练」，「吃」在减脂中扮演的角色不容忽视，甚至可以说是决定性的。关于「吃」我尝试以「总-分」形式展开，也就是先从整体上建立正确的饮食及营养观，后续我们再从人体所需三大营养素（碳水化合物、蛋白质、脂肪）及维生素矿物质等微量元素的微观层面切入，最终建立较为立体的健康饮食观。
本篇，我们主要探讨两方面内容，第一是从减脂角度出发，我们日常应当摄入多少热量，也就是吃多少的问题；第二是从宏观出发，我们日常饮食结构应当如何构成，也就是怎么吃的问题。
一、吃多少？
减脂期的我们，应当摄入多少热量？
在本系列上篇文章我们确立了以建立健康生活方式（营养搭配合理+适度运动）为核心的减脂观，也阐述了减脂应当是持久战，但归根结底，我们需要先把该死的脂肪减到合理（健康）程度。
根据能量守恒定律1，如果我们想要减脂，那么我们每日摄入热量需低于每日消耗热量，而每个人年龄、身高、体重及运动状况等情况不同，故每个人每日所需热量也是不同的，你们可以打开这个网址，在页面上输入年龄、身高、体重等指标，下方即可计算出「每日摄取建议值」中的「维持所需热量」大致就是你的 TDEE（Total Daily Energy Expenditure）。如下图是我本人的数据。

当你根据自身实际情况得出 TDEE 数据时，无论你每天吃什么，你每天摄入食物的热量都不应当超过 TDEE。当然不超过 TDEE 仅意味你的体型不会变化，想要减脂，每日摄入…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 20.3 现在为 Cinnamon 版提供了一个单独的 Edge ISO，以帮助用户使用最新一代的硬件！




Linux Mint 20.3 带来了一些改进。然而，它是由 Linux 内核 5.4 LTS 驱动的。

因此，使用较新硬件的用户可能会发现启动时很麻烦，或者遇到其他与旧的 Linux 内核不兼容的问题。

幸运的是，Linux Mint 20.3 现在有一个提供了 Linux 内核 5.13.0-25 的 Edge ISO。

带有 Linux 内核 5.13 的 Linux Mint 20.3

Linux 内核 5.13 通过 HDMI 引入了对 AMD GPU FreeSync 的支持，以及许多其他硬件改进。

因此，举例来说，如果你有一个 AMD GPU，并且在 Linux Mint 20.3 上遇到了问题，Edge ISO 可以派上用场。

是的，如果你有较新的硬件在使用 Linux Mint 20.3 时有问题，你可以试试 Edge ISO。

然而，Linux 内核 5.13 并不完全支持所有现代硬件，如英特尔 Alder Lake 处理器。

考虑到英特尔的第 12 代产品系列已经可以供消费者使用，一个更新的 Linux 内核可能是一个更好的选择，但有总比没有好。

因此，有必要指出，使用 Edge ISO 不会神奇地解决最新一代硬件的问题。你必须了解了 Linux 内核 5.13 的详细变化/支持，然后再进行尝试。

下载 Linux Mint 20.3 Edge ISO

你可以选择下载单独的 Edge ISO 或从更新管理器中更新 Linux 内核。



前往 “更新管理器”，然后从“查看”菜单中导航到 Linux 内核选项。你可以注意到，你可以安装其他可用的 Linux 内核（根据你的要求），如果需要，可以删除旧的内核。

建议不要删除旧的内核，除非你确定较新的版本能按预期工作。



在进行内核升级之前，你应该备份你的重要文件，以防万一。

Edge ISO 只限于 Cinnamon 版。所以，你需要前往 Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon 页面下载该 ISO。


Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon（Edge）版

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前序
在第一篇「复制清单」文章发布后，我收到很多用户的留言和建议，大部分人都希望清单能支持连续复杂粘贴。
由于iOS系统有很多安全限制，应用只能读取当前复制的内容，无法在后台连续读取剪切板。不过，方法总比困难多，在我翻阅了大量文档和资料后，「复制清单」终于成功支持后台连续复制粘贴。
非常激动地告诉大家: iOS也有像安卓一样，可以实时保存复制内容的剪切板应用了！
开启后台剪切板

打开应用选择右边剪切板工作栏，点击「开启后台剪切板」。

 
2. 点击开启后台剪切板后，顶部会出现一个悬浮条显示「等待复制」，它会实时显示你复制的内容，右滑可将它最小化。点击悬浮框左上角的「✖️』可关闭后台复制功能。

 
 
3. 切换到其他的应用复制文本，应用会实时读取剪切板，并保存文本到应用。应用将按顺序批量保存剪切板内容， 点右边的小箭头可最大化悬浮框。

 
 
 
4. 切换到清单键盘，选择第一个'剪切板'分类，在这个分类可以看到刚批量复制的文本，点击就可以输入。

 
 
5.  如果剪切板的内容很多，支持左滑动创建一条新的清单，或者长按呼出批量创建和删除功能，可快速地对内容进行归类整理。
 

 
 
写在最后
非常感谢曾给我留言的用户们，这让我对核心功能进行了重新思考。希望大家继续提供有用的建议，一起帮助完善复制清单。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我职业生涯的大部分时间都是自由职业者。有时候，我也会和一些想要辞掉全职工作去做一些承包或服务业务的人聊天。到目前为止，我们新手最常犯的错误就是为自己定价。

以 这篇有用的博客文章为例，它分析了美国雇员与自由职业者的收入间的对比。据估计，在美国，作为一名自由职业者，你需要获得 14 万美元的收入，才能获得相当于 10 万美元的雇员薪酬。我记得当我第一次创业时，我发现这样的计算非常有用。而，有些人看到结果会想：“哎呀，如果我是自由职业者，我得赚 1.4 倍的钱。我真的能做到吗？”

不，不，不，这种想法是落后的。

如何给自己定价

让我们举个例子。假设你是一名全职软件工程师，年收入 10 万美元，你正考虑转成承保。

当你是自由职业者时候，你必须像做企业一样思考，因为这就是你的谋生方式。所以，你必须把所有的成本加起来，并计算出如何收回这些成本。电子表格的口碑很差（有一些很好的理由），但它们实际上非常有用，尤其是对这些东西（以及作为企业主要进行的许多其他计算）。

第一个要加入统计的成本是那 10 万美元。如果这听起来很奇怪，那就是所谓的“机会成本”。你本可以继续工作以赚到 10 万美元；而没有赚到这 10 万美元，实际上是在规划业务时的一种成本。把这一费用和其他你实际使用的任何其它就业福利一起记下来。如果你的雇主提供工作日午餐，那就加上一年中每个工作日午餐的费用。如果你的雇主为员工提供健身软件的折扣，但你却没有使用该软件，那么不要将该福利作为机会成本。

其他费用取决于你在做什么和你住在哪里。员工医疗保险在澳大利亚不像在美国那么重要。另一方面，强制性养老金支付（类似于美国的 401(K) 计划）是一个大问题。我有自己的公司，我的主要非工资成本是保险、会计/档案、法律（合同审查等）、债务催收和各种在线服务成本。如果你在计算一些耐用的东西（比如一张桌子），把成本除…]]></summary>

  Intro


Creativity–the use of imagination and original ideas–has been exclusive only to the human experience. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), however, have called this notion into question. While AI technology has been incorporated into different forms of art generation, its newest advancement has come in the form of music creation.

To generate anything, AI needs to take in copious amounts of data, learn its patterns, and turn out various outputs until it gets a convincing enough model. In the case of music, a programmer ca…]]></summary>

2022年3月4日-2022年3月13日，第13届冬季残疾人奥林匹克运动会（简称「北京冬残奥会」）也将在上述两市举办。
冬奥在即，你可曾完整、系统地了解过北京冬奥会？你知道北京冬奥会的火炬叫什么名字吗？冬残奥的吉祥物「xuě róng róng」怎么写吗？你知道冬奥特许商品吗？
看了上面的问题，你可能会一脸问号：「北京冬奥会不就是一场运动会吗，还有这么多周边产品吗？」
答案是肯定的。如果你想了解这些「周边」的话，接下来我将带你探寻这片未知世界。
非商品类
会徽
北京冬奥会的会徽名为「冬梦」，设计灵感源于中国汉字「冬」，在经过设计之后使会徽兼具东方文化和现代风格，整体看起来像两个运动员（上半部分为滑冰运动员，下半部分为滑雪运动员），中间的线条「代表举办地起伏的山峦、赛场、冰雪滑道和节日飘舞的丝带」。该会徽的主题色彩为蓝色，寓意「梦想与未来」，红、黄两色则选于中国国旗，代表「运动的激情、青春与活力」。
冬梦
北京冬残奥会的会徽名为「飞跃」，以汉字「飞」为设计本体，在调整汉字结构后展现了其动感和力度，展现了一位正奋力冲向终点的残疾人运动员。它「整体充满了昂扬向上之激情，奋进飞跃之动感，色彩丰富，构图完美，象征并激发运动员以坚强的意志作为精神的翅膀，在冬残奥赛场上放飞青春梦想」。
飞跃
以上两个会徽（矢量文件）都能在北京冬奥组委官网下载。（友情提示：若要使用，请遵守会徽规范手册使用）
火炬
北京冬奥会的火炬名叫「飞扬」。此火炬以祥云纹样“打底”，自下而上，从祥云纹逐渐过渡到雪花图案，最后在顶端化身为飞扬的火焰。祥云纹恰好与2008年北京奥运会主火炬塔呼应，凸显了北京「双奥之城」的特点。
该火炬用碳纤维代替了钢材料，手感轻；同时中石化对材料进行了技术攻关，将一种耐…]]></summary>

Sorting is something we do everyday because it organises our environment and makes work easy. This is the same with solving problems programmatically. Sorting is done to give the user very good experience while using an application.
There are a couple of ways to sort. This includes bubble sort, heap sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on. 
This article's aim is to explain in detail one of these sorting algorithms. It is the Quick Sort.

That didn't happen.
Taylor wrote in the Laravel blog that the Laravel team had decided to postpone the release of Laravel 9 to early 2022––couple of months after the release of Symphony 6.0––as that will allow them to upgrade the underlying Symphony components utilised by Laravel. Otherwise, they'd have to wait until September of 2022 for such upgrade. This means that we should expect the release of L10 in January of 2023.
With L9 release nearly on us, I've decided to put together all that is contained within so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently involved in a project that required me to implement pagination from the backend and I would like to share the easy way I did it through this post.
For this post, I will be using a simple books API that returns a passed in number of books requested from the database. We will be able to pass in the page number and amount(limit) of books to be returned. 
Please note that this article was written with Windows users in mind. If you are on another OS, you could check out the commands to perform similar tasks online.
File Structure
First, let me describe how my file structure is:

I have a venv (virtual environment) folder where all modules required for this project are installed. You can quickly do that by following these steps:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started my writing journey on Hashnode, but I've been wanting to expand my audience by widely publishing articles across the interwebs. I discovered dev.to as another great platform to share developer-related content.

Dev.to has dedicated support for posting to the community from RSS. Additionally, dev.to supports canonical linking to protect SEO rankings. Luckily, Hashnode provides an RSS feed so republishing content from Hashnode onto dev.to is easy and fast.
You can find your Hashnode RSS feed at https://[your-blog-url]/rss.xml. For example, my feed is at blog.seancoughlin.me/rss.xml. You can also find it linked on your blog page. See the arrow in the screenshot below for the location.

After creating a dev.to account, open the settings and head to the Extensions tab. Under the Extensions tab, you will find Publishing to DEV Community from RSS. Simply copy your Hashnode RSS feed into the RSS Feed URL field and hit Save Feed Settings. After a few seconds, your Hashnode articles will appear as drafts in the dev.to dashboard.

To publish an article you will need to click edit and then change the published: false field to be true.

That's it! Now your articles will be hosted on dev.to in addition to Hashnode.

    at Module../node_modules/.pnpm/abort-controller@3.0.0/node_modules/abort-controller/dist/abort-controller.js (abort-controller.ts:62:1)

突然就很好奇，欧美那些基督教国家的普通人（非专业宗教人士），他们怎么看待宗教信仰？
电影中看到葬礼会有牧师去主持祷告，现实中也是这样的吗？
宗教信仰又怎样指导普通人的日常生活？是否他们每个人的一生都需要花些时间学习圣经？
或者是和我们没有宗教信仰的人一样，偶尔会去烧香拜佛祈福，拜完了佛基本就忘记这件事了🤣。只是一种寄托？

想到一个控制子进程的 cpu 使用率的简单方法。  
import platform
import time
from multiprocessing import Process, JoinableQueue

import psutil

from settings import CPU_FREQ, MIN_SLEEP_TIME_OF_SUBPROCESS, testLog
# CPU_FREQ = psutil.cpu_freq().max * pow(10, 9)
# MIN_SLEEP_TIME_OF_SUBPROCESS = 1 / CPU_FREQ


def subp(queue: JoinableQueue):
    while 1:
        if queue.empty():
            _st = 0
        else:
            _st = queue.get()
            queue.task_done()
        time.sleep(_st)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    sysv = platform.system().lower()
    expect = 90
    queue = JoinableQueue()
    queue.put(MIN_SLEEP_TIME_OF_SUBPROCESS)
    sp = Process(target=subp, args=(queue,))
    sp.start()
    spi = psutil.Process(sp.pid)
    if sysv == "windows":
        spi.nice(psutil.HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS)
    else:
        spi.nice(28)
    if sysv != "windows":
        spi.ionice(psutil.IOPRIO_CLASS_RT, value=7)
    testLog.info(f"pid: {spi.pid}, ppid: {spi.ppid()}")

    time.sleep(5)
    while 1:
        scpu = spi.cpu_percent(MIN_SLEEP_TIME_OF_SUBPROCESS)
        if scpu >= expect:
            testLog.info(f"sub-process cpu: {scpu}")
            if sysv != "windows":
                testLog.info(f"sub-process cpu_num: {spi.cpu_num()}")
            st = 1 / (((scpu - expect) / 100) * CPU_FREQ)
            testLog.info(f"st: {st}")
        else:
            # st = MIN_SLEEP_TIME_OF_SUBPROCESS
            st = 0
        queue.put(st)


原理如下：
 预期:
    1 / (（当前的占用率- 预期）/ 满载值 * cpu 频率。)
这个值就是子进程需要休眠的时间。
子进程只使用单核时，满载值就是 100 ，子进程再开孙子进程的情况还没考虑。
实测能达到预想效果。
各位还有其他的方案可以借鉴下吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本届CES2022，AMD带来新款桌面处理器、桌面显卡、移动处理器和移动显卡，其中的新款桌面显卡就是升级6nm制程工艺Radeon RX 6400 XT和Radeon RX 6500 XT ，而其中的Radeon RX 6500 XT在今天正式发售。
Radeon RX 6500 XT关键词：千元价位、6nm、RDNA 2

01/ 关于Radeon RX 6500 XT
AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT实际规格让人还是有些意外的，除了一些规格特殊之外，还有就是居然保留了【RDNA 2】大部分功能特性，甚至还最先采用了更为先进的6nm制程工艺，绝非新瓶旧酒的产品，这点来说挺不错的。
关于定价：目前Radeon RX 6500 XT官方指导价是1599元，如果关注装机市场朋友应该有感受，就是市面在1000-2000这个价格区间已经很久一段时间没有新品，上一代这价格区间的产品因为矿工需求等缘故，要么价格暴涨，要么直接没货，所以这次产品补全还挺重要，毕竟还是有不少用户显卡性能需求可能没那么高，只要求满足1080P FHD游戏体验即可。

【RDNA 2】特性全部保留
AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT基于Navi 24 GPU核心打造，依旧是RDNA 2架构，拥有16组CU计算单元，每一个CU计算单元里都包含一个【Ray Accelerator 光线加速器】，总共1024个流处理器，同时配备16MB无限缓存；显存部分配备了4GB的GDDR6显存，显存位宽为64位。
虽然核心\显存规格比其它RDNA 2架构高价卡低不少，但因为它也是最先采用6nm工艺制造，所以频率反倒是RDNA 2架构GPU里面最高的，且高出不少，基本就是靠飙高频来拼性能。

伴随RDNA 2架构，DX12U、DSAPI，DirectX光线追踪、可变速率着色、网格着色器、采样器反馈这些技术特性在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TinyWang: 背景：今天把充电盒搞丢了，官方售后补一个要 800 块。两只耳机电池状态感觉上不太好，但是具体续航时间没有测试。AirPods 是有 AC+的，还有不到两个月到期，可以意外换新。
问题：
1.AirPods 的 AC+是通过充电盒的序列号注册的吗，如果我去售后或从第三方买了原装充电盒并和耳机配对，AC+会对新的充电盒生效或继承过去吗
2.现在通过 AC+换新可以把旧款充电盒换成 Magsafe 充电盒吗，不管可以与否，如何以最低代价换一套新的耳机和 Magsafe 充电盒呢
3.本人身处十八线小城市，只有一家百邦的 Apple 授权售后点，不知道能不能用 AC+检测或换新 AirPods
主要还是在意第二条，本来想趁 AC+过期前去检测一下电池换一套，结果转眼就把充电盒丢了，闹心了一天。我明白弄丢肯定是我自己的问题，但是如果能有办法比 800 块买新的少花一点的话就最好了😥]]></summary>

不久之前，创建了一个关于元宇宙介绍的网站 https://itnext.cn
经过一段时间的演变，网站从最初的「人肉代码更新」行业动态变成了「可动态发布」。
也建立了相关社群，方便交流。
「元宇宙」作为目前来讲一个新的概念，个人保持不热捧也不抵触的状态。
建立这个网站，初衷是为了做信息整合，方便感兴趣的朋友时不时查阅，从最初完全转载其他站点文章，到编译部分境外媒体消息，利用业余时间做一些事情，完全没想盈利的事情，资讯只发布客观动态，不发布「观点」。
对于「元宇宙」的定义，目前来讲不同的机构、人都有不同的观点，其实最终形态还未知，让我们保持关注吧。
有兴趣的，可以访问网站加我微信，「一起交流，一起关注，一起拒绝被割韭菜」。
群内也会分享一些机构发布的相关报道。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英特尔将发布超低电压比特币采矿芯片

据报道，英特尔很可能在 2 月份的国际固态电路会议（ISSCC）上公布一种专门的加密货币开采芯片。这使该公司首次在比特币采矿 ASIC 市场上与比特大陆等公司展开直接竞争。ASIC 是专用于特定用途的集成电路芯片。英特尔的这款芯片代号为 “Bonanza Mine”，翻译成中文是“富矿”。


老王点评：在加密货币挖矿人人喊打的今天，英特尔发布这样一款芯片，耐人寻味。




Wine 7.0 发布

Wine 用于在 Linux、macOS 和其他平台上运行 Windows 应用程序/游戏。Wine 7.0 将许多组件转换为 PE 格式，改进了内置程序的主题设计，对内置应用程序的 HiDPI 支持，更新了 OpenCL 支持，对 VKD3D 1.2 的支持，更新 Mono、Unicode 14 支持，WinRT 改进等等大量变化。Valve 公司基于 Wine 的 Proton 软件为 Linux 上的 Windows 游戏提供了 Steam Play 支持，也给 Wine 提供很大的帮助。


老王点评：Wine 不但为 Linux 早期应用的匮乏帮了大忙，而且在今天，依然有很重要的意义。




预印本网站 ArXiv 已收录了 200 万篇论文

ArXiv 始于 30 多年前的几十位弦理论家的电子邮件列表，现在已经发展到收集了 超过 200 万篇 论文，成为物理学家、天文学家、计算机科学家、数学家和其他研究人员的中心枢纽。作为比较，亚历山大图书馆据认包含手稿不超过数十万份。论文作者们经常向 arXiv 提交手稿，然后在同行评议的期刊上发表，但越来越多的论文被单独发布在 arXiv 上。论文通常在一天之内就可以出现在 arXiv 上。除了传统的手稿，arXiv 还包含白皮书、历史概述，甚至是胡闹的愚人节论文。顺便说一句，ArXiv 的意思是档案，名字中的 “X” 是希腊字母 chi。


老王点评：这才是知识的殿堂，相比国内某论文网站，啧啧……

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This step-by-step beginner tutorial will teach you how to host your local Django project on Heroku for free. I haven't found many easy to follow tutorials on this topic so I decided to make my own after hosting many projects with the mentioned steps. Enjoy!
Create and activate a virtualenv, install dependancies.




python -m venv <env_name> # Windows
python3 -m venv <env_name> # Other

env\Scripts\activate # Windows
source venv/bin/activate # Other

Initialize a git repository (git init)
Add a .gitignore file
Suggested gitignore for Django
Add the following to settings.py:




STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')

Create a heroku account, login and install heroku CLI (choco install heroku-cli on windows)


Create runtime.py and add your project python version. Example:




python-3.10.1

Install gunicorn:




pip install gunicorn

Create Procfile and add the following:




web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi

Install django-on-heroku:




pip install django-on-heroku

Add the following to settings.py:




# Configure Django App for Heroku.
import django_on_heroku
django_on_heroku.settings(locals())

Add requirements.txt by running:




pip freeze > requirements.txt

Commit your changes:




git add .
git commit -m "Init commit"

Login to heroku from the command line:




heroku login

Create a new app:




heroku create app_name

Add your heroku app to ALLOWED_HOSTS:




ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_app_name.herokuapp.com', ...]

Commit your changes:




git add .
git commit -m "Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS"

Push your changes to heroku branch:




git push heroku master # Or branch name

Migrate your database:




heroku run python manage.py migrate

Make sure you have DEBUG = False in your settings.py file.
Open your app online:




heroku open

Create admin account:




heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser

If you have static files, run:




heroku run python manage.py collectstatic]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[很多问题不只有一种答案，比如这一个。
既可以就全新蒙迪欧设计和竞争力作答，也可以就全新蒙迪欧演变以及为何这般作答。两个答案都可以回答这个问题。只不过第一种回答是「鱼」，第二种回答是「渔」，需要读者自行判断，提炼答案。
我们尝试以第二种回答方式入手。
全新蒙迪欧并不是一款出人意料的车。
未真正亮相前，全新蒙迪欧大抵会有两种结果：一、由美国人（欧洲人）操刀继续做这款车真正意义上的迭代，在中美两国市场投放；二、按照EVOS的外观设计，衍生出轿车版的中级轿车，并命名为蒙迪欧。
关于全新蒙迪欧外观，实际上已经建立了两种预期，剩下的就是待全新蒙迪欧揭晓，告诉我们最终选择了哪一种。这就是为什么没有出人意料。
回过头去，美国人设计的蒙迪欧会是什么样子？
如果推测美国人设计的蒙迪欧，就必须先回到全新一代福克斯以及即将中期改款的福克斯上来。这是一款非常重要的车子。
2018年，全新一代福克斯在中国上市。作为福特全球车型，福克斯没有太多中国市场的元素。当时福特在中国的设计中心也没有成立，但随着福特中国战略的逐步推进，在福克斯这款车上，看到了越来越多的中国元素。
现在的福克斯拥有两套设计，一种为标准版，小开嘴、三角灯，大灯中间回形标；另一种是猎装版，大灯保持不变，但中网开始靠近EVOS以及蒙迪欧。


中控也是如此。新福克斯上市时采用了全球统一的内饰，但福特中国研发出了SYNC+车机系统之后，福特在华销售的车型都同步更换了这套车机，以至于个别车型出现了些审美上的问题。


按照历代福克斯和蒙迪欧之间设计上的关联，海外媒体的好事者曾经做出过下一代产品的假想图，只是这个假想图在今天看来，变成了Mustang Mach-E，但蒙迪欧也可以是这样。



那么，为什么会出现这种情况？
大的原因是——
中国市场和美国市场在消费需求上正在割裂，表现为通用、福特全力推动SUV品类的建设，逐步取消了轿车产品的研发…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从海南度假回来有 2 个月了，但我仍然时常想起在海口的最后一个夜晚，那个大爷真是给我留下了深刻的印象。

在到海口之前，我已经在三亚和万宁待了挺长时间，对海滩，寄居蟹，椰子和清补凉已经不再像刚来时候那么热衷，而寒冷，干燥，昂贵又逼仄的北京，却非常奇怪的对我产生了越来越大的吸引力，总之，我是想回去了。

最后一个晚上，是在海口，我找了机场附近的一个民宿，好在第二天天亮之后更方便的去机场，然后回到阔别已久的北京。

民宿在一片别墅区里，即便是在别墅区里，这样的一座4层的小楼，也显得很有气派，装修的不算豪华，但很舒服。院子里则停着 4 辆奔驰 GLS。我在订这个民宿的时候，看到评论里说，这个民宿会免费用奔驰接送机，我倒不是图这个，主要是想，虽然有点不可思议，但能用奔驰接送机的民宿，其他方面按理不应该太差。

我被安排到了 4 楼的房间，我简单收拾了一下，出门遛了个弯。

遛弯结束后，我没立刻回房间，一楼有一个挺大的餐厅，我准备把中午没喝完的粥继续喝两口，进餐厅的时候我发现，已经坐了两个人，一个年纪大点，是个大爷，一个年纪小点，是个大叔，他们前面也摆了好些菜，不过这餐桌这么大，也不妨碍我，我坐到离他们稍远些的位置，然后开始喝粥。

为什么不到房间里喝呢？因为刚入住的时候，前台就告诉我，为了保持整体清洁，老板禁止客人在房间里吃饭。

喝了几口粥后，桌上的大爷跟我闲聊，问我从哪来，玩几天，什么时候走，我应付了两句之后，问他，你是这里的老板吧？大爷听到我的话一愣，然后哈哈大笑，说我不是，我是个打杂的，老板是旁边这个。

旁边的大叔连连摆手，说大爷才是老板，自己只是打工的。

聊了两句之后，大爷似乎有点兴致，邀请我一起喝酒，我注意到大爷已经开了一瓶红酒，但我不太好意思，就推辞了一下，大爷很热情，直接让大叔给我倒上了一杯端了过来，然后大叔有事就先走了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I attended a webinar by Codementor yesterday about tech hiring, where the speaker Jeff Lam shared these insightful gems on creating resumes that help candidates stand out:
Regardless of ATS (applicant tracking system) or a human reviewing your application, here's what they look for:
your tech stacks
relevant experience for the role
clear & concise profile/resume (if too long, recruiters may even skip reading it)
make it easy to read with bullets, tech stacks, project details
keep it short & concise, don't overwhelm with info
recruiters (& ATS) are experts at keyword search. Add relevant ones
add tech stack at the bottom of every employment

give personality to your professional profile: it could be through choice of words, colour, font or anything else
be active in tech communities and link it to your resume: Github, LinkedIn, Twitter

don't just write responsibilities. Write about something challenging you've worked on, any projects.
optimize content for the role. The more relevant it is, there's a higher chance of getting shortlisted
reach out to key decision makers in the company you're applying for.
add numbers and quantify wherever you can. Specify the duration of employment. Recruiters (and ATS) are not technical experts but they use them to derive your degree of skill level & understand your seniority
In short, it's not difficult but takes some effort to optimize :)
Recently, I launched a product which helps candidates to create resumes with these elements easily. It's now live here: Resumey.Pro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些文章包含了黑科技、鲜为人知的事实，以及在使用 Git 时可以派上用场的技巧和窍门。




Git 是代码协作开发工作流程中不可或缺的一部分。无论你是初学者还是专家，第一件事就是在使用开源代码时需要学习这个功能强大的版本控制系统。对于 Git，不需要知道所有事情，但是了解一些特殊的黑科技可以让你在 GitLab 等平台上更轻松地分享代码，因此你可以与不同地方的开发人员协作。如果有什么没把握的地方，git --help 可以帮助你。

我每天都为了解 Git 所提供的控制能力而感到惊讶。没有哪种情况是你无法恢复到早期版本的，无论你所处的情况是多么不可能或棘手。

在 2021 年我们发布了大量 Git 的文章；我只汇总了其中前 10 篇，这些文章包含了各种黑科技、鲜为人知的事实，以及在使用 Git 时可以派上用场的技巧和窍门。

使用 git stash 命令的实用指南

Ramakrishna Pattnaik 解释了 git stash 命令 的功能。这篇文章重点介绍 git stash 如何帮助你列出、检查、保存和恢复更改，以确保切换分支时的无忧体验。它还可以帮助你跟踪在本地无需提交的更改，而同时保持干净的工作目录。

5 个让你的 Git 技能更上一层楼的 Git 命令

Seth Kenlon 详细介绍了 五个鲜为人知的 Git 命令，它们可以让你的生活更轻松。开发人员可以使用 git whatchanged、git stash、git worktree 和 git cherry-pick 等命令来节省时间。

Git cherry-pick 简介

Rajeev Bera 教程将引导你了解 git cherry-pick 命令 是什么，为什么和如何使用它，并列出 git cherry-pick 可以帮助你避免棘手的情况所有用例。

3 个使用 git cherry-pick 命令的原因

我分享了 利用 git cherry-pick 如何帮助你避免冗余，一次性处理多个提交并恢复丢失的更改。

使用 git worktree 自由地尝试你的代码

git stash 命令负责将更改保存到工作目录。Seth Kenlon 向我们介绍了 git worktree 和几个 git worktree 用例，它们可以帮助你将存储库恢复到已知状态。

Git 上下文切换的 4 个技巧

Olaf Alders 的这篇文章讨论了使用 Git 时 切换分支的四种不同方式 的利弊。这些选项将帮助你简化工作流程，并保持干净的工作目录，而不会丢失你的更改。

查找 Git 提交中的更改

Seth Kenlon 解释了如何利用如 git log 和 git whatchanged 等简单命令来提取有关 Git 提交内容中更改的特定信息。这是一个有用的快捷方式，而且名字很容易记住。

管理主目录的 7 个 Git 技巧

Seth Kenlon 分享了 使用 Git 管理和组织 $HOME 变量 的注意事项，并解释了它如何让他的跨设备生活更实用。更好的是，这让他可以自由地尝试新想法，因为他知道他可以轻松地将它们回滚。

GitOps 与 DevOps：有什么区别？

Bryant Son 向你介绍了 GitOps，他将其描述为 DevOps 的进化版本，它使用 Git 作为单一事实来源。这篇文章还列出了其它有用资源，可用于学习 DevOps 并在开源领域找到工作。

开始使用 Argo CD

Ayush Sharma 详细介绍了 Argo CD 的优势，这是一种基于拉取式的 GitOps 开发工具。Argo CD 通过在 Git 中管理 Kubernetes 清单并将它们同步到集群中，为你提供两全其美的体验。

你能想到其他让你的生活更轻松的 Git 技巧吗？请在评论中告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Viewing PDFs in applications is a common request that is easily solved with the PDF Library for .NET.
Step 1
Use NuGet package manager to install IronPDF:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf
PM > Install-Package IronPdf
IronPDF DLL can also be downloaded and manually installed.
How to Tutorial
We are working on a visual framework for viewing PDFs in C#/.Net - in the mean time you have lots of viable free options without resorting to Adobe Acrobat.
For web applications - PDFs can be viewed in a browser window or iframe. You may also use the amazing pdf.js library from mozilla to leverage a full PDF viewer written in pure javascript code.
https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/
For viewing PDF documents directly in WPF you can use the native WebBrowser control.
For viewing PDF documents directly in windows forms (WinForms) applications the WebBrowser control is also a good choice.
To open a PDF from any application in an external window, we may use a trick involving System.Diagnostics.Process.Start.
This will generally open the PDF in the default web browser which supports viewing PDF content, or Adobe Acrobat if installed.
C#:
// Render any HTML fragment or document to HTML
var Renderer = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer();
var PDF = Renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello IronPdf</h1>");
var OutputPath = "ChromePdfRenderer.pdf";
PDF.SaveAs(OutputPath);
// This neat trick opens our PDF file so we can see the result in our default PDF viewer
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(OutputPath);

VB:
' Render any HTML fragment or document to HTML
Dim Renderer = New IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer()
Dim PDF = Renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello IronPdf</h1>")
Dim OutputPath = "ChromePdfRenderer.pdf"
PDF.SaveAs(OutputPath)
' This neat trick opens our PDF file so we can see the result in our default PDF viewer
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(OutputPath)]]></summary>

一开始我还会接听一下电话，现在已经麻木了。而且除了电话，还有各种威胁性质的短信。比如调取了他本人的手机通讯录要联系这些人;一会又是什么要通知街道居委会。前几天，我通过一个中间朋友传话给这个旧友，他的原话是说这个催债电话和短信都是诈骗性质的，说让我无视就好了。我本以为他是好面子，找了个借口自己偷偷去还上了钱。但是没想到这几天电话短信还是在发来，而且有板有眼。还有什么律师告涵什么的。
1 、有没有什么可以屏蔽这些骚扰电话的办法啊？
2 、这个事情能不能有什么投诉的渠道？
3 、这真的是诈骗电话？如果是诈骗电话，对方没有直接表示让我去代替这个朋友还款。
对方这几天打电话来，我选择性接听一下，然后都是直接告诉对方，你们要去拉横幅就去拉好了，不要再来骚扰我了。]]></summary>

They all end with _scan? But what do they scan? Let's have a closer look.
exclusive_scan


std::exclusive_scan resembles a lot to std::partial_sum that we discussed in the previous episode. It takes an input range denoted by its beginning and its end, an output range defined by its beginning and an initial value for the summing.
Exclusive in the name means that the given *i*th element is excluded from the partial sum. To see this perfectly, we can have a look at the first element of the output which is the initial value instead of the first element of the input.…]]></summary>

如题，我看了下似乎 API 层面可以实现的？使用微信的付款码支付接口或者支付宝的当面付接口
流程大概如下：
顾客出示付款码->商家打开小程序->使用小程序扫描获取到该付款码->小程序调用后台接口传递付款码->后台调用付款接口，如 https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/api/micropay.php?chapter=5_4  完成支付
不知道会不会有一些审核或者政策上的风险？
另外该功能我们是想作为小程序插件提供给我们的客户的，不知道是否可行]]></summary>

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

由于 HAP（HomeKit Accessories Protocol）的开放性质1，配合 HomeBridge / HomeAssistant 庞大的插件库，几乎做到了万物皆可 HomeKit 的程度。今天我们就来把家中的 PlayStation 游戏机的唤醒和休眠加入到 「家庭」应用中并控制。

本文以 HomeBridge 为例，HomeBridge 运行在 Ubuntu 系统的树莓派上。安装和使用 HomeBridge 请参考这篇文章：HomeBridge 操作指南：从零开始，将你的米家设备接入 Homekit
本次接入的原理是根据 Github 上开源的 PlayStation 唤醒软件进行配置，再接入到 HomeBridge 调用运行配置好的唤醒软件。从而达到曲线救国的 PlayStation 的 HomeKit 化，接下来我们就分步骤进行安装与配置。
安装控制软件
本方法使用 playactor 控制软件来操控 PlayStation 系统。由于 PlayStation 并不支持传统的 WoL ，现在有的方法原理都是基于索尼自家的 PS Remote Play 这款软件的原理进行开发的。

根据 playactor 项目的文档，本项目支持 PS4 的全部操作和 PS5 的部分操作。在加入 HomeKit 之后我们仅需要用到 Wake 与 Standby 两个指令即可。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在开头
人物志系列停更许久，笔者本想先把陈朵人物志写完，但是思来想去，这个人物实在太火了，还是不凑那个热闹吧。
回望作品，笔者发现王也这个角色总能让人感触颇深，米二也愿意为他花费笔墨描绘他的人生轨迹，细腻之处甚至让笔者怀疑，王也就是米二理想中的自己。
他就像你我身边的一个朋友，在面上活得潇洒，混不吝，遇事有能量，有手段，年纪轻轻便走到了物质和精神两个层面的高峰。在骨子里他也温润如玉，豁达自在，哪怕怀璧其罪没有惶恐不安，哪怕力有未逮也始终放不下天下苍生， @天师道的白山正 说他和周圣合称”内圣外王“，这个”王“便是王也所行的王道。而在笔者看来，王也这个人物不仅仅是有其崇高的一面，他也有凡俗人的一面，相比“藏巧于贱”的张楚岚和“飞蛾扑火”的诸葛青，他向往逍遥世间的偷闲，也更是不愿沾染这世间的因果。
在笔者看来，王也其人，配得上”无为而无不为“一语。

生于安乐窝
王也作为中海集团老板王卫国的三公子，他的身家算得上出道即巅峰，投的一手好胎。
父亲的生意家大业大，父母还非常恩爱，生了三个儿子不够（王亦、王又、王也，瞧瞧这名字起的，啧啧啧），还想继续生闺女，甚至还有能助兴的蓝色小药丸，不得不说也总有一个幸福的原生家庭。

王卫国原型
此处有个小细节，王也的父亲叫做王卫国，出身行伍，上过边境，在部队里面也曾是吆五喝六的人物，其原型则是真实世界的两位牛人的混合体。
一位是王校长他爸，16岁就参军，17岁就到吉林省集安县的鸭绿江边成为了一名侦察兵，25岁就晋升排长进陆军学院进修，35岁则转业下海，62岁时登顶华人首富。这份经历和王卫国的人设不能说完全一致，只能说一毛一样。

另一位原型人物则是“玉帝专业户”，国家一级演员·真·王卫国。
先后在《西游记续集》、《宝莲灯》及《宝莲灯续集》中，饰演玉皇大帝一角，因此被广大观众熟知。有趣的是，正是因为王卫国扮演玉皇大帝的形象让人过目难忘，在以后的…]]></summary>

        <id>829240</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/829240"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[celisee: 
买东西
虽然知道天猫上面假货多，但是我在一个药房买到假货还是震惊不已。
在人的朴素认知下（尤其是国内），药房这种地方不会卖假货，更不用说是在天猫上开的药房旗舰店。
双 11 在瑞康大药房旗舰店（天猫）买了两瓶芙丽芳丝洗面奶，一直到近两天才开始用（之前的用完了）。
打开之后就闻到了异味，第一个念头是过期了？
随后看了下生产日期和保质期，25 年过期。
按下怀疑的心，用了一次，和以前的产品使用体验相差很大。
查评价
我去查了下这个产品的评价，差评看不见，但是网友们在问题回答里面普遍说是假货。
投诉
然后在淘宝 app 上发起了退款--原因为：夸大虚假功效描述，与商品宣称不符。
因为当我想选假货投诉时，app 提示仅能对淘宝和 1688 商户发起。
随即就不得不赞叹，天猫就是一个“真货”认证保障，当你想投诉时，人家已经把假货选项屏蔽了，怪不得假货横行（花钱就行）。
淘小二的处理
淘小二联系我，判决人家胜了。因为商户上传了商品授权书。（有商品授权书就代表他卖的一定是真货吗？这是什么逻辑。）
这家进货企业是：深圳市鑫洁峰实业有限公司。授权企业为仪菲（上海）品牌管理有限公司。
让我去专柜验货，并且拿到假货的凭证。
去专柜验货这种说法真的是无知啊（提这种说法的人心都是坏），我不是对专柜卖货人员有啥意见，而事实是很多都是流动性很大的，所以他们几乎无法给你什么参考意见，更遑论去鉴真假。
我随即放弃了这个选项，每天生活都把精力耗尽了，哪有时间和精力为了这 100 多块钱去讨一个非常不力甚至无结果的结局？
结局
我能做的只是告诉身边的朋友，在天猫上买东西要小心。同时曝光这个店铺。
当一个斗升小民遇到一件事时，他往往会自认倒霉，因为他光是要生存都要费劲全力。

小弟我国庆期间因为 B 圈的问题团队解散了，然后回到城市边缘装修房子，装完后不想进城找工作，就找了一远程的岗位。
之前熟悉 PHP 、Golang 、Python 、Javascript 、HTML 、CSS 等，对 Vue 一知半解，没想到找的远程竟然是负责 C# API 接口和 uni-app 。 经过 2 个月的试用和磨合期，算是正式成为团队一员。
目前看起来没啥大的变化，感觉唯 N 的变化就是：
使用 coding.net 的 issue 作为项目和 bug 管理工具。
所有任务，北京的主管会拆解成一个一个 issue ，然后大家开会讨论，讨论结束就按照 issue 一个一个完成就好。
项目会有大概的工期，但这之前不会催促，只要不落下，人家根本不管你在做什么。
于是小弟的工作时间差不多是 6:30 - 8:30 -  吃早餐 - 9:10-9:45 开早会  - 工作到 11:30 做饭吃午餐午休到 14:00 - 17:00 做饭吃晚餐 19:30-22:00 工作。晚上时间挺自由，不自由就是做的事千万不要出问题，否则会有夺命连环 call.
薪水降了 60% 左右，他们的意思是就是房贷+吃饭，其它给股份，感觉也不错。
工资发的非常及时，1 月 10 日发 12 月工资的时候顺带把 1 月份的都发了。
我自己有公司交五险一金，公司会把五险一金折合成 RMB 打到卡上。
这种情况下，要是有精力还可以做点其它事情，我比较懒，又到年关了，就没折腾了。]]></summary>

最近想用 go 实现图片合成视频，无奈只合成了无音频的 avi 视频。用的 gocv （牛刀杀鸡），其实也就是 opencv 的 VideoWriter ，opencv 底层还是 ffmpeg 。
也可用 go 的 exec.Command （）执行 ffmpeg 命令实现五花八门的功能，但是使用命令行的方式使我内心“十分不安”。
想问一下 V 友有无最小的实现方案=>仅需实现几张尺寸类型不同的图片合成有简单过渡特效加背景音乐的 mp4 文件。
这里有个 MiniProgram 挺让我好奇他的实现方式，MP 搜“图片合成视频”，有很丰富的处理功能，还是个个人开发者（作者名字居然和我领导名字一样，天啊）
或者，提供一个不错的方案？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022 年 1 月 17 日，春运正式拉开帷幕，共计 40 天，同时也是进入疫情防控常态化以来的第二个春运。1 月 15 日，铁路公安机关在铁路 12306 App 中试点上线「电子临时乘车身份证明」，方便未携带 / 丢失身份证的乘客及时搭乘列车。
而搭乘飞机的乘客，可通过民航公安于 2019 年正式上线的「民航临时乘机证明」小程序办理「电子临时乘机证明」，在值机与安检时使用。
🚆 通过 12306 App 申请电子临时乘车身份证明
注意事项

「电子临时乘车身份证明」仅限持有中国居民身份证的乘客办理。购买优惠客票的旅客，取票时仍需提供有效证件证明优惠资格（如学生证等）。
电子证明的二维码为动态生成，每 60 秒自动更新，当准备通过闸机时，请及时切换到二维码页面，并将屏幕调至最亮，避免因为二维码过期或网络原因、手机卡顿，在闸机前停留过久。
电子证明在有效期内（审核成功后的 24 小时）无需重新申请，一个自然月内可申请 3 次。
申请电子证明超过 3 次的，或未办理中国居民身份证、不便使用手机的旅客（如婴幼儿、老年人），需前往站内的公安制证窗口办理「纸质临时乘车身份证明」，具体地点请询问站内工作人员。
申请还是有点麻烦的，要弄介个弄辣个，不会捣腾的且着急准备上车的，快向身边的工作人员求助，要不您就准备改签吧。

安装 App
第一步，在手机中安装 铁路 12306 App。安装完成后，打开 app，输入账号、密码登录，并根据提示完成短信核验或人脸核验。如需为他人申请或情况紧急，可跳过此步骤。
 
办理临时身份证明
在首页中，点击应用导航中的「温馨服务 → 乘坐旅客列车临时身份证明」。此处需允许 app 使用手机的定位权限。（目前铁路 12306 App 爱心版界面暂不支持办理。）

进入到申请页面，app 会自动填充当前登录用户的身份信息，如有需要，通过更改为他人的身份信…]]></summary>

In this article, we created two models, the User and the Hobby model.
If you like to follow along, download the following GitHub repo.
The very first thing we'll want to do is install Fastify.

They are compelled to do a lot of coding if they need to add a button to several sites. Other frameworks force developers to rebuild the majority of their code, even when creating regularly changing components. Developers desired a framework or library that would allow them to break down complex components and reuse code to accomplish projects more quickly. This is when React comes in and solves the issue.
*What is react.js?

ReactJS is a widely used open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook. It can control the view layer for both online and mobile-based apps. ReactJS is mostly used to create reusable UI components. It has an easy-to-use UI. Its large community is alway…]]></summary>

介绍
基于 TinyMce 实现的一个可以导出 docx 格式的编辑器
有什么用
在电脑上未安装 office 的情况下假设有文档需要生成为 docx 可以临时应急。
经过二开，可以作为简单的在线文档、简历生成等工具使用。
限制
暂时未处理图片
数据保存在哪
纯前端实现，网站不存储任何数据。也就是数据不会经过服务器，通过 blob 实现文件下载。
是否开源
部分代码需要脱敏，后续会开源

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OBKoro1: 

stop-mess-around
项目介绍
减少摸鱼的时间和频率的 Chrome 插件：在上班 /学习期间很容易下意识的打开摸鱼网站，插件帮助我们减少摸鱼的时间和频率，提高我们上班和学习的效率，节省时间用于学习提升自己或者享受生活。
插件功能
匹配摸鱼网址
打开网页后，插件会自动匹配自己配置的摸鱼网站。
成功匹配后，弹出提示信息，提示用户关闭摸鱼网站。
如果觉得疲惫了，也可以选择休息一下。

网站摸鱼检测关闭，摸鱼休息时间提醒
当你关闭摸鱼网站检测时，会在摸鱼网站的右侧有一个倒计时提醒以及摸鱼时间统计。
如果不需要，这项配置可以在插件的管理面板的设置中关闭的。

近百日摸鱼时间统计表
插件会统计近一百天的摸鱼数据，超过一百天则会被删掉。
每天会根据摸鱼耗时进行排序，会统计摸鱼休息时间的点击情况。
如果提前关闭摸鱼，会返回剩余的摸鱼时间

插件管理面板
点击插件图标，打开插件管理模板，对插件进行配置。

在线 VSCode 快速查看仓库代码
现在查看 Github 仓库代码，可以直接把github.com/仓库地址改成github.dev/仓库地址(官方)和github1s.com/地址，这两种形式来使用在线版的 VSCode 来查看。
在github1s这个插件看到这个小功能，因为确实蛮实用的，也不想再装插件了，想着把它也集成到本插件中
插件直接把按钮显示在仓库名旁边，这样在wiki、actions、issues、Pull Request等页面也可以使用
支持github.dev(默认)以及github1s，可以去（插件管理面板 => 设置）更改
PS：我以前都是用Octotree文件树来查看代码的，现在感觉可以把这个插件删掉了 哈哈，还是直接用在线 VSCode 比较香

插件的价值与使用场景
就我个人而言，真的很有用，很有效果。帮我抵制了摸鱼网站的诱惑，减少了摸鱼的时间与频率，为我节省了很多时间。
摸鱼时起到提醒的作用，在摸鱼的时候知道自己在摸鱼。
匹配摸鱼网站有弹窗提醒，关闭摸鱼检测又有倒计时和摸鱼时长统计。
在摸鱼的时候知道自己摸鱼，休息好之后，就又可以投入学习和工作了。
而不是下意识的打开网页浏览摸鱼网站，因为奶头乐比较爽，然后一看就是好几个小时过去了，事后又会觉得内疚与空虚。
自制力较差的同学，想要提高工作和学习的效率，但是又经常摸鱼，
自制力差的同学可以用工具来对抗诱惑，摸鱼的快乐很容易让人沉迷。
从而导致工作和学习的效率并不高。
插件使用时间久了，自然而然也会降低自己摸鱼的频率和时间的。
摸鱼少了，工作和学习的效率就高了。
节省下来的时间，可以用于学习提升自己或者享受生活（早点下班，去阅读，去健身，去吃喝玩乐，做任何自己喜欢的事情）。
需要稍微奋斗卷一下的时候，希望自己减少点摸鱼。
比如需求截止时间要到了，希望自己减少点摸鱼。
比如某段时间比较忙，希望自己减少点摸鱼。
比如要忙着毕设、期末考试等，希望自己减少点摸鱼
奋斗逼、卷王
这类同学不多说了，懂得都懂。😂
后记
鉴于上次刚开源宣传(我用来阻止你摸鱼看沸点、知乎和微博的 Chrome 插件)的时候，因为不让大家摸鱼，被大伙儿“举报”、怒斥为“资本家的走狗” 。
我真的希望这个开源工具可以有效的帮助有需要的同学减少摸鱼时间，提高工作和学习的效率。
我说这么多的意思不是在“洗地”，大伙儿别再“举报”我了 我是友军 😂
我的其他开源推荐

我开发了一款叫“Sc 翻译”的翻译扩展，受困于用户量一直不怎么增长，甚至怀疑自己写的扩展是不是没有吸引力什么的。
“Sc 翻译”是开源的，我觉得像这种扩展要是不开源我也不太敢用，然后是当时为什么起成这种....不..合流...的名字也是因为懒地去想，想要把重点放在功能的实现上，自然 logo 也是直接用“Sc”打发掉算了，想着：挑战一下吧，看用这种烂名烂 logo 能不能收获一定的用户量。
结论当然是不可能的，这一点在 Firefox 和 Chrome 的扩展商店里得到了论证。但是在 Edge 商店里倒是靠着一段时间的“翻译”搜索的页面里排名靠前而获得了不少的用户。
虽然我从 Edge 商店的排名算法中得到了不少的用户，但是这种排名算法绝对会被滥用。一个克隆我的扩展 v3.12.0 版本的叫做“谷歌翻译”，带着更好的 logo 和更靠前的排名，以及一些广告甚至可能包含一些危害用户隐私的代码，用一个月的时间就在用户量上超过我了....啊这。然后这个扩展还是所有像这些侵权类型里用户涨得最高的，让我有点高兴，起码这是侵我权的扩展，但不妨我想说文明词语。
是的，我说了这些，用“翻译”在 Edge 商店搜索，前 11 个里面有 8 个都是这种针对开源的侵权 + Spamdexing 的扩展，3 个是克隆我的，3 个是克隆 6 版本的划词翻译，1 个是克隆沙拉查词，1 个是谷歌翻译。这些扩展都加上了广告，然后我没验证过的可能会包含危害用户隐私的代码。
我的扩展是完全开源的，还迁移到 Manifest Version 3 这种更在乎用户隐私的版本，连谷歌分析都懒得加上去，版本更高，功能更多也更稳定，但是用户还是选择了那种版本更低有广告甚至可能有一定风险但是排名较高的扩展😂，明明只需要往下滚动一下，多看几个扩展😂。
在用户会偏向这种扩展的情况下，作俑者用扩（扩展）海战术直接确保了过半（估计）的新用户会下载这种扩展。]]></summary>

主要是指路由器原生的系统，个人重点关注这三点：  
是否有 IPv6 防火墙开关和具体设置  
是否支持 IPv6 穿透模式（ Passthrough/Realy/IPv6 桥）  
日常运行、重新拨号后是否能稳定工作
欢迎大家补充
原因在以前的帖子讨论过了。过了快两年，想了解一下国内品牌路由器最新的情况，以便选购参考。  
顺便说一下个人的选购考量：  
5GHz 信号穿墙衰减太严重，考虑 AC+AP 或者 Mesh 方案；  
为了保证稳定性，方便自己不在家时解决网络问题，准备用原生系统不刷机；  
有 IPTV 的需要，光猫默认只提供路由模式。虽然有网友提出了桥接的方案，但上海电信的 4K IPTV 配置太复杂，且过去尝试发现有断流问题，故仍可能需要维持光猫的路由模式；  
局域网内有 NAS 等设备，希望可以用 IPv6 在外部直接访问；]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[gh110827: 前因：
我们提交名称认证：车有保。审核人要提供保险资质，我们提供了合作公司的资质证明，合同扫描件。
    然后审核人员进行官网电话确认，电话打不通，我也解释了，西安疫情目前在封城，所有人都在家办公，办公区电话没人接。
    随后我提出了解决方案，我们有业务负责人电话，可以直接跟他沟通。行不通之后，我们提出可以用保险中介公司官网上邮箱进行发邮件确认合作的真实性。
结果：
第三方审核人员也把这个信息提交上去了，结果微信审核人员多次拒绝我们提出的方案，就是不给我们通过审核，导致我们不得不改个名字先通过审核发版。
更乌龙的是，我在后台通过客服消息联系上了认证审核的客服，跟他们说明了情况，他们把我踢给了第三方审核人员，让我跟他们沟通，完全不理我的诉求。
我想问腾讯：
1 、我们小程序本身就是有保险类目资质的，而且是 7 月份刚审核通过的，这种改名审核资质是不是可以减少下流程？
2 、改名称资质再次审核这些都没问题，官网信息审核也没问题，但是这种因为疫情导致联系不上，难道不能稍微变通一下？
    3 、这个问题处理过程中没有任何一个人提出如何解决问题，我们主动提出的好几个方案都被否决了，所有的审核人员都是说规则如此。规则是死的，人是活的。腾讯的体制已经僵化到这种地步了吗？]]></summary>

下面是从美团看到的文章：
有些术语没看懂，有歹佬给解释一下吗？
为降低 CDN 异常对业务的影响，提高业务可用性，同时降低 SRE 同学在 CDN 运维方面的压力，在方案设计之初，我们确定了以下目标：
端侧 CDN 域名自动切换：在 CDN 异常时，端侧第一时间感知并自动切换 CDN 域名进行加载重试，减少对人为操作的依赖。
CDN 域名隔离：CDN 域名与服务厂商在区域维度实现服务隔离且服务等效，保证 CDN 切换重试的有效性。
更精准有效的 CDN 监控：建设更细粒度的 CDN 监控，能够按照项目维度实时监控 CDN 可用性，解决 SRE CDN 监控粒度不足，告警滞后等问题。并根据容灾监控对 CDN 容灾策略实施动态调整，减少 SRE 切换 CDN 的频率。
域名持续热备：保证每个 CDN 域名的持续预热，避免流量切换时导致回源。
第二条：服务隔离且服务等效是什么意思？
第四条：CDN 域名的持续预热什么意思？
第四条：流量切换时导致回源。不这么做为什么会回源？]]></summary>

认真生活的人，从来不会被辜负。

大家好，我带着这款有些不一样的日记 App「你的一天」和大家见面了。开发这款 App 的最初想法是，可以用模块化、流水账的形式，记录每一天的普普通通的生活。同时，也可以用它帮助和督促自己认真对待生活、记录生活。
普通而又独特的「日记」

早上起来，大雨。
心情很糟，今天是周一，还要去上班，又要把鞋子弄得湿漉漉了。
公司的午餐好好吃，天气也放晴了，好开心。

像上面的这段简单的日记一样，每天的心情、地点、天气都是随时间变化的，我特别希望能够随时、随手记录这样的变化，这也是我希望做到的，记录和观察生活的方式。
所以，「你的一天」来了。
图片由「你的一天」生成
像上面一样，可以分别使用文字、图片、声音、位置、天气、心情六种基础模块，帮助你构筑每一个专属于自己的普通而又独特的一天。
日记使用小技巧
接下来，我来悄悄的告诉你一些使用「你的一天」记录日记的小技巧，帮助你更好地使用它。
日记元素排序
每一个日记元素都支持长按拖拽排序，你可以任意组织它们的顺序，甚至还支持跨天移动。
iPad 拖拽添加照片
如果这时候，你的手中恰巧还有一台 iPad，还可以直接拖拽照片进来，拖拽文字也是可以的。这项功能在 iPhone 上也是可以使用的，不过在 iPad 上，使用起来会更加方便。
最棒的是，你不必担心 iPhone 和 iPad 的数据同步，我们使用 iCloud 帮你把所有数据管理起来，这从你第一次打开 App 的时候，就是默认支持的了，不用担心数据的遗失。
筛选记录
如果你已经使用它很长时间了，那么一些有特殊意…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[allenchen10: 
TLDR
V2Reader 是一个用 SwiftUI 开发的，在 iOS 、iPadOS 和 macOS 上的 V2EX 第三方客户端。因为所有的数据都是通过访问 V2EX API 2.0 Beta 来获取的，而这份文档还在更新，有很多数据没有提供，所以 V2Reader 的功能还比较有限。之后随着 API 的更新，会有更多功能加入。
简介
我前段时间看到 V2EX API 2.0 的页面，就试了试，当时还提了一个小 Issue，站长很快就修复了。那个时候刚好还在放假，想着入门一下 iOS 开发，然后用这些 API 写一个客户端练手。之后大概花了两周时间开发到当前版本，目前只用了 SwiftUI 原生的组件，没有使用第三方库。因为才刚接触 Swift ，基本是一边学一边写，很多地方的代码还有点乱，等以后整理好了应该会开源。
安装
加入 Beta 版“V2Reader for V2EX” - TestFlight - Apple
设备要求
iOS/iPadOS 15 以上，或者 macOS 12 Monterey 以上（使用了 Catalyst ，所以 Intel Mac 也可以安装）。
功能
通过不同节点访问主题以及回复

搜索节点并关注或者将节点添加到主页

点击发布者或回复者的用户名查看用户信息

自动在 @用户 后添加楼层号，可以点击跳转到对应的楼层，然后点击蓝色箭头跳回原楼层

iPad 版本以三列视图显示，支持分屏或小窗模式

Mac Catalyst 版本

FAQ
为什么不支持更低的系统版本？
主要是因为我用了很多去年 WWDC 新加入的语法，比如 AsyncImage 、MainActor 、task 、refreshable 、searchable 之类的。
为什么 API 2.0 Beta 已经有了获取提醒的 API ，但软件内还没有实现？
有两个原因：一、这个 API 获取的内容都是 HTML 格式的，我还没有考虑用什么方式去解析，不像帖子中的内容是 Markdown 格式的，可以用 iOS 15 新引入的 AttributedString 。二、这个提醒 API 还获取不到帖子的 id ，暂时也没办法实现点击跳转帖子的功能。
为什么有些 Markdown 格式的内容没有正常显示？
因为 AttributedString 还没有支持 Markdown 格式的全部语法，我猜测下次 WWDC 会支持更多。
为什么不支持 App 内发帖 /回帖 /收藏 /感谢等功能？
我暂时打算只使用 API 2.0 Beta ，而这些数据目前还无法通过这些接口获取。当然如果需要的人很多，我之后可能会用解析网页之类的方式来实现。目前点击发帖回帖的按钮会跳转到网页版。
为什么需要用 Token 来登录？可不可以使用账号密码或者免登录？
V2EX API 2.0 Beta 必须有 Token 才能够访问，用户需要在设置中自己创建 Token ，然后复制粘贴到 App 中，App 会将 Token 放入系统的 Keychain 保存。用 Token 是否安全，可以参考站长 @Livid 在这个帖子中的回复。
为什么使用一段时间之后加载不出内容了，重新启动之后显示 Token 无效？
站长设置了每小时最多请求 API 600 次，这种情况可能是达到了限制，可以等整点后再尝试。
为什么主页中最多只能添加 5 个节点？
主页每次刷新时，每个节点都需要单独访问一次 API ，主页中包含的节点过多会导致很快达到 API 请求次数的上限，目前设置的是最多 5 个，如果觉得不够请在 TestFlight 里反馈，我会考虑在之后的版本里调整。
最后
我写这个 App 只是作为学习 Swift 的练手，目前支持的功能还不多，并不能代替网页版或者别的优秀 App ，大家有兴趣的话欢迎加入 TestFlight 测试体验，反馈使用中的问题和需要改进的地方。]]></summary>

In this blog, we will understand the basics of Cosmos DB partitions and the use of Cerebrata in visualizing the data stored in Cosmos DB SQL API containers based on the partition keys.
A logical partition consists of a set of items that have the same partition key. For example, in a container that contains data about customer addresses, all items contain a state property. You can use state as the partition key for the container. Groups of items that have specific values for state form distinct logical partitions. When new items are added to a container, new logical partitions are automatically created by the system.
There is no limit to the number of logical partitions in your container. Each logical partition can store up to 20 GB of data. Good partition key choices have a …]]></summary>

签名算法
在 HTTP 请求中的 Header 中需发送 sign 字段，sign 字段为将 appid 、token 和 timestamp 加密后的签名内容。签名算法为 lowercase(md5(appid+token+timestamp))
示例：
appid: ENHmKoxq97i4eRHn
token: LUZa2HfaxoLkAbgVc3BfNMzG6EaGJHvr
timestamp: 1561952337000
sign: 323fa1f3c22ea7e0fb4886513205dd87 =
lowercase(md5(ENHmKoxq97i4eRHnLUZa2HfaxoLkAbgVc3BfNMzG6EaGJHvr1561952337000))
协议约定
返回内容为 JSON 格式。HTTP header 可加上 Content-Type:application/json
为了方便排查问题，建议调用的时候 header 加上 X-Request-ID 值为 uuid
如：X-Request-ID:c5159cf9-1b60-41a8-90fb-5e507c8e01b9

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。
我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。
音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。


关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。

如果你喜欢玩复古游戏，你可能已经接触过复古游戏机模拟器。顺便说一句，所谓“模拟器Emulator”（仿真器）主要是指允许主机系统运行为另一系统设计的游戏的软件或硬件。

最近，Cemu 成功引起了开源社区的注意力。它是众多复古电子游戏模拟器之一，可以让你玩为任天堂 Wii U 定制的游戏。然而，到目前为止，它在一个主要方面与大多数模拟器不同，即它是闭源的，但这即将改变。

Cemu 简介

Cemu 是一个流行的基于软件的复古电子游戏模拟器，专门模拟任天堂 Wii U 游戏，它是这类模拟器中第一个。它利用了 OpenGL 和 Vulkan 来运行游戏。

多年来，它已经有了显著的进展，现在可以 玩整个 Wii U 库中的 51% 的游戏。这包括《马里奥卡丁车 8》和《塞尔达传说：荒野之息》等热门游戏。

虽然它早在 2015 年就发布了，但 Cemu 只能运行在 Windows 上。不过，开发者发布的新路线图指出，Cemu 应该很快就会移植到 Linux 上了。

而且，最令人关注的是，Cemu 将走向开源！

通往开源和 Linux 之路

路线图总共包括了由开发人员计划的八个里程碑。其中包括计划开发一个 Linux 移植版并向社区提供代码。

谈到 Cemu 的开源问题，开发者计划在 2022 年完成这一工作。所以，你不应该对此寄予厚望。

迁移到 Linux 涉及到将源代码从 C 语言改写成 C++ 语言，并从 Visual Studio 迁移到 cmake。

以下是开发者对将 Cemu 引入 Linux 的看法：


我们最终想提供一个原生的 Linux 版本。这一直是一个正在进行的副计划，尽管由于优先级较低和依赖于其他任务而进展相对缓慢，但现在已经完成了大约 70% 的工作。


开发人员还提到，移植过程伴随着其他工作，如软件 H264 解码器和 cubeb 后端。由于主要的工作已经完成，可以说 Cemu 很快就会出现在 Linux 上。

其他计划

开发人员已经考虑将 LLVM 作为 CPU JIT 后端，用于将 PowerPC（Wii U 的主机架构）转换为 ARM 等 X86 架构。

他们还刚刚开始着手开发一个新的着色器反编译器，以减少着色器编译时间和卡顿。

你可以参考 官方路线图 了解更多细节。

总结

这对渴望做出贡献并使 Cemu 变得更好的复古游戏爱好者来说绝对是一份大礼。

Cemu 最终将加入许多流行的、开源的任天堂游戏机模拟器的行列，如 Citra、Dolphin 和 Yuzu。

你对 Cemu 的开源有什么看法？复古游戏模拟器应该是闭源的还是开源的？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[aaatches: 垃圾短信已经无法阻挡，哪怕 V 站首推的熊猫吃短信也必须经过精确调教才好使。
尝试着半年时间把所有短信通知都禁用了，没想到不仅不会影响日常生活，而且体验相当不错。这里分享一下我觉得大家会关注的一个问题：禁用短信通知为什么不会影响日常生活
1.验证码通知
虽然各种验证码已经渗透到日常生活中，但一般收到验证码之前我们自己肯定是知道的，所以在收到验证码后哪怕没有通知也不影响，只要打开信息 app 就可以看到验证码了。而且苹果手机即使禁用了短信通知，只能填充验证码的功能依然正常使用
2.收快递通知
短信通知收快递都不会是很急的那种。最常见的是快递柜，可以放一段时间不用急着去拿。如果平时有习惯追踪自己的快递在哪一天到的话，不需要短信通知也能够知道大概哪一天会有快递。
3.扣费通知
这个虽然有点危险，但如果平时养成习惯保护好自己的信用卡的话其实影响也不大。这个我推荐平时少使用实体卡，多使用 apple pay 等电子媒介，安全性会更高
剩下的对于我来说已经没有任何需要关注的短信了，收不到这些短信是一种幸福]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「如期而至」APP上线一年左右，目前已经更新到 1.9.3 版本。去年重新设计和优化了很多地方，也如期完成了对 iPad 和 Siri 两个重要功能的支持，让记录和管理物品变得更加方便和快捷。
顺着这一年的版本更新记录，在此总结一下「如期而至」APP 的变化。
主题颜色修改
「如期而至」默认主题色是蓝色，一开始很多人说颜色太冲眼或太直男，希望有多个主题色可以选择，所以很快就推出了有 5 个颜色选择的版本。随着时间对色彩感受的弱化，我也意识到预设的几个颜色会满足不了用户的选择，于是后面又推出了自定义颜色，真正实现“赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，你的APP你做主”。

修改主题颜色之后，整个APP的主导色会跟着改变，包括小组件、消息通知框等。在使用自定义颜色的时侯，建议不要使用太淡的颜色，因为在诸如回顾视图日历、iPad 版环形图等地方会自动计算颜色深浅，太浅的颜色就会造成颜色异常。受制于 iOS 开发机制，APP图标没法动态同步自定义的颜色，所以目前只有 5 种颜色的图标可供选择。
丰富小组件样式
小组件如今有 5 款样式可供选择，“即将到期列表”可以按标签来进行显示。最早做的小组件设计不规范，在每个机型上显示都会不一样，后来改为按照公式自动计算间隙、宽高度，目前在各个设备上就比较正常了。

优化通知提醒
一开始做的提醒设定是每天都会进行提醒，比如选择了提醒范围 30 天，就会在物品剩余 30 天内每天都进行提醒，频繁的提醒容易让人烦燥和麻木。经过一番摸索后改成了递增的方式，越接近过期的物品提醒次数越多。
“提醒范围”每项对应的提醒时间点
增加开封功能
“开封”对于物品期限管理来说很重要，像是化妆品开瓶、咖啡豆开封等使用场景很有意义，所以也加入了开封的功能。按住物品向左滑动，显示开封设置界面。如果是当天拆封进行记录的，只需要填写新的期限保存即可；而如果是之前开封的，可以向右滑动开封界面，点…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14192-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-01-19T02:21:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从本周 1 月 20 日起，Ubuntu 21.04 将不再收到任何更新。是时候考虑你的升级选择了！




Ubuntu 21.04 运行良好、添加了有趣的功能，也包括一些值得注意的变化，如 对多显示器的改进、用户界面的改进、支持 GNOME 40 的应用程序等等。

现在，是时候升级了。

Ubuntu 21.04 的更新支持在本周，即 1 月 20 日 结束。

你将不再收到任何关于 Ubuntu 21.04 系统的更新。如果你一直在使用 Ubuntu 或其某种风格，如 Ubuntu MATE，你需要将你的系统升级到 Ubuntu 21.10。

顺便提一句，Ubuntu 的非 LTS 版本维护期为 9 个月。如果你是 Linux 的新手的话，我建议你了解一下 Ubuntu 发布周期。

所以，现在你必须升级到 Ubuntu 21.10，然后再为 2022 年 7 月的另一次升级做好准备。不过，这样你的时间就充裕多了！

升级到 Ubuntu 21.10

除非你有一个没有连接到互联网的系统，并且你希望它继续使用 Ubuntu 21.04，否则建议你现在就升级。

在没有任何更新的情况下，你的系统将继续受到新的安全风险的影响。所以，在做决定之前要记住这一点。

Ubuntu 21.10 引入了许多变化，包括 GNOME 40、Linux 内核 5.13、对高质量蓝牙音频编解码器的支持、暗色/浅色主题等等。

所以，你可能要开始考虑你的升级选择了。

你可以继续使用 Ubuntu，升级到 21.10。如果你考虑用不同的东西进行全新安装，也可以尝试像 Pop!_OS 21.10 这样的发行版。

不要忘了，还有各种的 Ubuntu 的风格版呢。

要开始升级，你只需要搜索 “软件更新器Software Updater” 并点击它，让它寻找升级并通知你。

无论你有什么发行版，软件更新器或你的软件中心应该给你提供升级选项，或者你可以在系统设置中找到它。

而且，然后按照屏幕上的指示，再点击几下就可以进行升级过程了。

重要的是，为了安全起见，在执行升级之前要备份你的必要数据。

在一些像 Ubuntu MATE 这样的版本中，你也可以选择使用终端，输入以下命令开始升级：

sudo do-release-upgrade


通往 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 之路

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的 预期功能列表 应该不会让你失望。因此，你可以在它发布时轻松地升级到它，或者留在 Ubuntu 21.10 上，等待 7 月份支持结束时升级。

你是否期待着 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 在今年 4 月的发布？或者，你愿意坚持使用 Ubuntu 21.10 直到 2022 年 7 月？

Let's get start with the 7 principles of software testing described on syllabus CTFL - Certified Tester Foundation Level, BSTQB/ISQTB. This principles was created through over the years.
1 - Testing shows the presence of defects
First of all, the goal of software testing is verify if errors exists but we cannot guarantee that there's no any error even the message says the ours test passed. When we think about TDD, clearly, first the code fail, after is necessary create what is necessary for passing test.
2 - Exhaustive testing is not possible
When we talking about something exhaustive in the computer science we need do pay attention, because that means more complexity. So, it …]]></summary>

感觉是个陈年 bug 了，2-3 年前某次系统升级后 Options 自定义快捷键就各种卡顿和延迟，到最近甚至浏览器前进后退这种基础操作会莫名其妙延误 4-5 秒才触发，更别提各种自定义宏，快捷键。官网也抱怨过，各种方法也试过，无论是老 Intel 还是 M1 全新系统都是一模一样的问题，试用了 Options+ beta 也无效，直到这次升级，目前用了一周下来，再也没遇到过，虽然各种触发还是不如 Win 下流畅，但是至少不会延迟个 4-5 秒这么扯蛋。
另：Options 还是 x86 编译的，按 Logitech 这种破公司的尿性，怕是还要花上 5 年才能意识到 Mac 已经转向 Arm 了。]]></summary>

Caching is the process of storing data in a high-speed storage layer so that future requests for such data can be fulfilled much faster than is possible through accessing its primary storage location. An example of caching that you may be familiar with is the browser cache, which stores frequently accessed website resources locally so that it does not have to retrieve them over the network each time they are needed. By maintaining a cache of objects on the user's hardware, retrieval of the cached data is almost instantaneous, leading to increased speed and user satisfaction.
In the context of server-side applications, caching aims to improve the application's response times by reusing previously retri…]]></summary>

在未来 IPv6 广泛部署的背景下，端到端的通信不再是难事，但在外部访问内网服务的安全问题也随之而来。我们不会为此重返到 NAT 的时代，也不需要繁杂的隧道配置。
有这样的设施，它会在默认情况下阻挡目的地为受保护的网络的来自外部网络的访问。当你想要从外部网络访问受保护的网络时，可以访问一个认证站点（也可以是别的服务），它会记录通过认证的终端的 IPv6 地址，将这个终端的地址放入受保护网络的访问白名单中。而且为了安全，这个设施会阻止不安全的协议（比如 HTTP ）。
我可以想象到这样的具体使用情景：
我在外面想要看家里的监控摄像头，我不希望让别的人能够有机会访问到我的摄像头，所以它会阻拦所有不在白名单里的主动传入连接。我登录到自己的认证服务，它记录下了我的 IPv6 地址并为我放行。
尽管有点像 IPSec 传输模式而且不如它安全，但是对于访问内部的带加密的服务来说是足够安全的，而且对于客户端来说非常轻量级。
现在有没有厂商提供这种方案？]]></summary>

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战
本篇文章翻译自官方的👉总览文章，这篇文章基本上把 Flutter 介绍清楚了，如果想从总体上知道 Flutter 是咋回事，本篇文章是最好的教程了。
以下是正文
本文旨在从高层级提供一个 Flutter 框架结构的总体概览，介绍一些其设计上的核心原则和概念。
Flutter 是一个跨平台的 UI 工具包，目的是一份代码可以运行在不同的操作系统上，比如 Android、IOS等等，同时也可以让应用直接和底层的平台服务交互。我们的目标是：尽量用一份代码，开发者就可以在不用的平台上开发出高性能、高保真的 APP。拥抱差异，更少代码，更高性能。
在开发阶段，Flutter 运行在虚拟机上，虚拟机提供了 hot reload 的功能，可以加载每次开发者改动的差异代码，而不需要全代码的编译。在正式版本上，Flutter 应用是直接编译成了机器码：Intel x64、ARM、JavaScript等等。这里说的开发阶段和正式版本是指 Flutter 产物的模式，Flutter 的产物有三种模式 debug、release、profile。Flutter 的 framework 是开源的，开源的协议是 BSD 协议，并且有活跃繁荣的第三方库社区，这些优秀的第三方库很好的补充了 Flutter 的能力。
本文的总览分为以下几个部分：
分层模型: Flutter 的组成部分
响应式 UI : Flutter UI 开发的核心概念
Widgets 介绍: Flutter UI 代码构建的基础
渲染流程: Flutter 是如何将 UI 代码转化为屏幕像素点的
平台嵌入 的总览: 让移动端和桌面系统运行 Flutter 应用
用其他代码集成 Flutter: 介绍 Flutter 可用的不同的技术…]]></summary>

A static website + WordPress blog 🤔
A very very common scenario where you want to keep your website static or build with Nextjs SSG, or probably with Reactjs. On the other hand, your marketing team wants WordPress to write blogs because it's in their conform zone and they don't want to learn anything new.
In a startup, where you don't have much time to deal with all these. You might choose one of the three following options:
Build your entire website with WordPress using a theme so your content writers feel at home
Create static pages for each blog and deploy them with the static site
Create a custom blogging tool
But hold on, you have another option. It requires a bit of a hassle though for the first time. But it will make your life much easier on the lon…]]></summary>

Dynamic Notifications and Support Hours will help you do exactly that, but you might have missed them on your first journey through PagerDuty. Let’s take a look at what they can do for your team.
Dynamic Notifications can help you better manage what actions are taken when an alert is received on a particular service. They are linked to the service itself, so your team can customize actions for different services to meet the specific needs of that service and prioritize the most important services for immediate response. 
There might be any number of reasons why a service doesn’t require 24x7 high-priority response:

Let's see how it turned out.
I'll be using BaseX implementation of XQuery, you can get it with brew install basex.
First let's create a simple document hello.xml:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<persons>
  <person>
    <name>Alice</name>
  </person>
  <person>
    <name>Bob</name>

Then with this hello.xquery:
<messages>
  {
    for $name in doc("hello.xml")//name
    return <message>Hello, {data($name)}!</message>
  }
</messages>

We can get our answer:
$ basex hello.xquery
<messages>
  <message>Hello, Alice!</message>
  <message>Hello, Bob!</message>
</messages>

By default it lacks XML header, and the final newline.

I attempted to solve the Advent of Code 2021 problems using both Haskell and JavaScript to find an idiomatic functional solution. Unfortunately, I learned along the way that certain approaches and techniques are not practical in JavaScript. This led me to the conclusion that functional programming has different flavors, and it is important to find the right blend for your language of choice.
JavaScript is the language I use the most (whether by choice or not), and fortunately it supports functional programming fairly well. I think the bare minimum requirement needed for a language to claim to support functional programming is ergonomic support for higher order functions…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Google I/O 2019，我们分享了 Room 2.2 的最新进展。尽管当时已经支持了很多功能，如 支持 Flow API，支持预填充数据库，支持一对一及多对多数据库关系，但是开发者们对 Room 有着更高的期望，我们也致力于此，在 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 版本中发布了很多开发者们期待的新功能！包括自动化迁移，关系查询方法以及支持 Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) 等等。下面我们就来逐一介绍这些新功能！
如果您更喜欢通过视频了解此内容，请 点击此处 查看。
自动化迁移
在谈自动化迁移之前，先看看什么是数据库迁移。假如您更改了数据库 schema，就需要根据数据库版本进行迁移，以防用户设备内置数据库中现有数据丢失。
如果您使用 Room，那么在 数据库迁移 过程中会进行检查并验证更新后的 schema，另外您也可以在 @Database 中设置 exportSchema，来导出 schema 信息。
对于 Room 2.4.0 版本之前的数据库迁移，您需要实现 Migration 类，并在其中编写大量复杂冗长的 SQL 语句，来处理不同版本之间的迁移。这种手动迁移的形式，非常容易引发各种错误。
现在 Room 支持了自动迁移，让我们通过两个示例来对比手动迁移和自动迁移:
修改表名
假设有一个包含两个表的数据库，表名分别是 Artist 和 Track，现在想要将表名 Track 改为 Song。

如果使用手动迁移，必须编写和执行 SQL 语句才能更改，需要如下操作:
val MIGRATION_1_2: Migration = Migration(1, 2) {
    fun migrate(database: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {
        database.execSQL("ALTER TAB…]]></summary>

1) Todo List
Color Box Maker

App - this component should render the TodoList component


TodoList - this component should render the NewTodoForm component and should render the list of Todo components. Place your state that contains all of the todos in this component.


NewTodoForm - this component should render a form with one text input for the task to be created. When this form is submitted, a new Todo component should be created.


Todo- this component should display a div with the task of the todo.




  
  
  For each Todo component, there should also be a button with the text “X” that when clicked, removes the todo.



  
  
  Each Todo component should also display a button with the text “edit” that when clicked, displays a form with the task of the todo as an input and a button to submit the form. When the form is submitted, the task of the text should be updated and the form should be hidden.


https://github.com/Developer-io-web/Todo-list
https://github.com/Developer-io-web/Color-Box-Maker
App - this component should render the BoxList component.
BoxList - Place your state that contains all of the boxes here. This component should render all of the Box components along with the NewBoxForm component
Box- this component should display a div with a background color, width and height based on the props passed to it.
NewBoxForm - this component should render a form that when submitted, creates a new Box. You should be able to specify the Box’s width, height, and background color. When the form is submitted, clear the input values.



  
  
  When each Box component is displayed, add a button with the text of of “X” next to each Box. When this button is clicked, remove that specific box. This will require you to pass a function down as props - the button should not be a seperate component, it should be included in the Box component.]]></summary>

The first way: Flow/Systems Thinking
The second way: Amplify Feedback Loops
The third way: Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning
These practices are well covered in both “The DevOps Handbook” and the “Phoenix Project” books. In this post, we will look more closely at a concept mentioned in “the second way”: feedback loops. From the “Three Ways of DevOps”: “The second way is about creating the right to left feedback loops. The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made”.
In simple terms, a feedback loop is a process where the outputs of a system are used as inputs again.

A year ago, we were struggling a bit with how to define Jamstack in a world that included the ability to use SSR in a Jamstack application. At the time, this was unique to Next.js, but today you'll find this supported in Nuxt.js 3, Gatsby 4 and even Eleventy via the Eleventy Serverless plugin. Not just that, but we've now added in multiple other kinds of rendering such that I wrote an extensive article clarifying the various types of Jamstack rendering.
2021 also included the release of some new tools that gained a great deal of popularity very quickly and introduced a new concept, the islands architecture, to the Jamstack. Both Astro, a completely new SSG, and Slinkity, which is built on top of Eleventy, offered the ability to use frameworks…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


This tutorial will learn about for-of introduced in  ES6 version of JavaScript.
The for...of statement is used for iterating over arrays, maps or sets.
Example in code:
const fruits = ['Orange', 'Apple', 'banana', 'Lemon']

// looping through
for (fruit of fruits) {
  // do something with fruit
}

for...of can also be used to loop over contents of a string.
const words = 'Happy new year!'
for (char of words) {
  console.log(char) // H a p p y n e w y e a r !
}

A set is a collection of unique values.
const letters = new Set(['a', 'b', 'c'])

for (letter of letters) {
  console.log(letters) // a, b, c
}

A map is key-value pair, where key can be of any type. In JavaScript it's common to use object literals as maps
const details = new Map( [
  ['name', 'Michael Myers'],
  ['age', 45] // made up
])

// or a cleaner way:
const details = new Map()
details.set('name', 'Michael Myers')

for (detail of details ) {
  console.log(detail)
}

for...of introduces a cleaner way of looping over arrays, sets, strings and maps.

With a career came Campfire (Basecamp) and then Slack launched in August 2013. Slack, for the purposes of this post, is used as a proxy for asynchronous chat platforms/tooling. Such software has become ubiquitous to the daily toil for knowledge workers and expands into professional, personal, and hobby communities.

每次换时区搞不清楚的时候 还会担心会不会漏一天的签到
8 年多了 8 年前我还在刚刚准备出国留学
国内本科学的土木 本来还想研究生换计算机 结果成本太高 放弃了
当时就想 要是真的能靠写代码养活自己 多好
现在算是实现了吧 打工的公司从 2 人变成了 60 人的团队 从开始那两年那天早 9 晚 8 到现在早 10 晚 5 其实并不觉得轻松 有好多别的事情要想。有时候还挺怀念最开始啥也不用管 就吭哧吭哧写代码的日子
也不知道哪里来的勇气 也敢拒绝 FANNG 的 offer 了 面试的过程让我对这些公司 失望透顶 反而是很多创业公司面试的时候可以让我产生激动的情绪
今年打算把非工作的时间 都拿来写自己的 side project, 锻炼一下自己的市场和销售能力 看看自己还剩不剩点青春 还有几天就 30 岁了
这个网站 甚至整个互联网 越来越少分享 以前总是提醒大家不要跟陌生人讲话 现在我们是不是应该提醒一下大家 世界上还是有好人的 也可以去倾诉和倾听

You have only one laptop
You have your personal GitHub account
Your employer stores code on GitHub as well
You need to commit your personal code to your personal repositories but also work code to the employer`s repositories.
You can`t do this from your personal account but do not want to create an additional one (with corporate email)
What to do in this situation? There is a way, how you can configure your laptop to commit to work repositories with work credentials, and to personal one with your personal one.
This solution is based on 2 aspects:
correcting SSH config
git URL re-writing
The main advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require any additional work to get it right. You will not need to change remote URLs or remember to clone things differentl…]]></summary>

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲 每天打卡一道算法题，既是一个学习过程，又是一个分享的过程😜
🌲 提示：本专栏解题 编程语言一律使用 C# 和 Java 两种进行解题
🌲  要保持一个每天都在学习的状态，让我们一起努力成为算法大神吧🧐！
🌲    今天是力扣算法题持续打卡第62天🎈！

 🚀 算法题 🚀 

🌲原题样例：同构字符串
给定两个字符串 s 和 t，判断它们是否是同构的。
如果 s 中的字符可以按某种映射关系替换得到 t ，那么这两个字符串是同构的。
每个出现的字符都应当映射到另一个字符，同时不改变字符的顺序。不同字符不能映射到同一个字符上，相同字符只能映射到同一个字符上，字符可以映射到自己本身。
示例1:
输入：s = "egg", t = "add"
输出：true

示例2:
输入：s = "foo", t = "bar"
输出：false

示例3:
输入：s = "paper", t = "title"
输出：true

提示：
可以假设 s 和 t 长度相同。
🌻C#方法：一次遍历
对比下标数组是否一致，用于检测两字符串同构。
代码：
public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t)
    {
        List indexS = new List();
        List indexT = new List();

        for (int i = 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：72 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了82.28%的用户
内存消耗：39 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了7.60%的用户

🌻Java 方法：哈希
思路解析
需要我们判断 s 和 t 每个位置上的字符是否都一一对应，即 s 的任意一个字符被 t 中唯一的字符对应，同时 t 的任意一个字符被 s 中唯一的字符对应。这也被称为「双射」的关系。
以示例 2 为例，t 中的字符 a 和 r 虽然有唯一的映射 o，但对于 s 中的字符 o 来说其存在两个映射 {a,r}，故不满足条件。
因此，我们维护两张哈希表，第一张哈希表 s2t 以 s 中字符为键，映射至 t 的字符为值，第二张哈希表t2s 以 t 中字符为键，映射至 s 的字符为值。从左至右遍历两个字符串的字符，不断更新两张哈希表，如果出现冲突（即当前下标 index 对应的字符 s[index] 已经存在映射且不为t[index] 或当前下标 index 对应的字符 t[index] 已经存在映射且不为 s[index]）时说明两个字符串无法构成同构，返回false。
如果遍历结束没有出现冲突，则表明两个字符串是同构的，返回true 即可。
代码：
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        Map s2t = new HashMap();
        Map t2s = new HashMap();
        int len = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i 
执行结果
通过
执行用时：24 ms，在所有 Java  提交中击败了25.02%的用户
内存消耗：38.4 MB，在所有 Java 提交中击败了48.09%的用户

复杂度分析
时间复杂度：O( n )
空间复杂度：O( ∣Σ∣ ) ，其中 Σ 是字符串的字符集。哈希表存储字符的空间取决于字符串的字符集大小，最坏情况下每个字符均不相同，需要O(∣Σ∣) 的空间。

平时因为各种需求会写很多奇奇怪怪的脚本，但是经常会碰到下面的问题：
不知道怎么就挂了，但也不常 check log ，然后东窗事发的时候就很烦
有很多共用的代码，但是因为是脚本而且需求只有微妙的不同就图省事直接 copy paste 了
cli 的脚本没跑一次还要专门开 cmd 然后定位到路径，还要写参数，想想就烦（虽然写一个 bat 能解决就是了）
反正因为种种的不便就 craft 出了一个姑且能用的脚本管理器，支持：
失败邮件提醒 [WIP]
drag and drop 当作输入运行 [WIP]
统一的 log 管理
简单的配置，并且能导出
支持一个脚本调用其他脚本
极其简单的 api （只有汇报 success 和调用其他脚本这两个）
给脚本语言封装好的简单的库 [WIP]
定时任务支持（ cron 太烦了，反正就是玩具就写写每隔多少秒执行，虽然也可以加） [WIP]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[qloog: 
2022 年给自己定一个小目标，万一实现了呢？ 不，是一定要实现 😝
概要
近几年各大应用基本都有社区（动态）的功能，展现形式各不相同，比如国内的有：
微博
朋友圈
抖音
小红书
国外的有：
Instagram
Twitter 等（当然他们做的就更糟早了）。
也算是比较流行的一个 feature 了，刚好本人近几年也一直从事此类的开发，所以准备搭建一套出来。
社区在 APP 中的作用
简单来说就是使用动态功能可以提高用户在应用内的活跃度，让用户在应用内停留的时间更长(个人观点)。
当然最基本的用户功能也是需要有的，那么如果一个用户发了一条动态，粉丝如何收到呢？ 所以这里也离不开关系服务。可以先来看下整体架构。
为什么要做这么一套服务？
主要有两个目的
之前都是使用 restful API 来开发的，基础服务会用 gRPC 来实现，同时也对之前做的一些不好的地方做下优化和改进
把实现思路开放出来，希望可以帮助到需要的同学
💡 如果有觉得设计不好的地方也欢迎提供建议，共同改进。
通过这套微服务可以学到什么？
微服务如何划分
代码目录如何分层
REST 的使用
gRPC/ProtocolBuffer 的使用
GORM/Redis/Kakfa 在 Go 中的使用
链路追踪的使用
微服务在 K8S 中如何部署
等等...
业务架构图

服务划分
该微服务系统整体会包含如下 4 大服务：
1. 用户服务(gRPC+Protocol Buffer)
该服务主要提供以下功能
注册
登录
更新用户信息
获取用户信息
批量获取用户信息
2. 关系服务(gRPC+Protocol Buffer)
该服务主要提供以下功能
关注
取消关注
批量获取关注关系
粉丝列表
关注列表
3. 动态服务(HTTP)
该服务主要提供以下功能
发布动态
获取动态详情
点赞动态
评论动态
回复评论
点赞评论
我发布过的动态列表
我关注的动态列表
最新的动态列表
4. 聚合层服务
主要对外提供 API 服务，面向的是前端，比如 WEB, iOS, Android 等
上面的几个服务大部分接口都会从此服务进行逻辑调用处理。比如处理用户数据，关系数据等
技术选型
开发框架 🦅 eagle 微服务框架
开发语言 Go
分布式缓存 Redis
数据存储 MySQL
数据库操作 GORM
RPC 通信 gRPC + Protocol Buffer
应用部署 Docker + K8S + Helm
监控告警 Prometheus + Grafana
分布式链路追踪 Jaeger
消息队列 Kafka/RabbitMQ
开发步骤
会按照服务逐个进行开发，最后在聚合服务中进行组合，最后供客户端进行调用。
聚合服务 ins-app
  用户相关 API 开发
  关系相关 API 开发
  动态相关 API 开发
用户服务 user-service
  画架构图
  数据库定义

  定义 repo/service
  业务逻辑实现
  注册 grpc 服务进行测试
关系服务 relation-service

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dislike 是一个日常生活事务管理工具。
之所以说这款 App 另类，一则 Dislike 专门设计来打理生活琐事，而非像多数同类产品一样着眼于效率提升；二则 Dislike 没有遵循任何既定的时间管理理论，完全依照普通人的日常使用「直觉」设计、开发。
这意味着使用 Dislike，你不需要为了记录、提醒一些事情去强迫自己学习任何理论，或是改变一种生活方式。
关于时间管理的完整思考，我在《我们究竟需要怎样的时间管理工具》这篇文章里有较详细的记录，感兴趣的朋友可以翻阅。
如果市面上鼎鼎大名的 GTD 类 App 你用了个遍都无法坚持，说明你很可能和我一样不是个「效率达人」，那么我非常推荐你试试 Dislike。
Dislike 基础功能介绍参见这篇文章：
 
Dislike 3.0 做了 10 余项较大的功能新增及优化，以及一堆没仔细数过的细节提升。
虽然做了很多工作，但 UI 层面仍然保持了精简、克制，这也是从 Dislike 着手设计 1.0 至今一直贯彻的理念。
拣几个 3.0 的重点功能说说。
事件创建重构

Dislike 3.0 完全重新设计、开发了事件创建功能。
这也是 3.0 版本最耗费精力的一块开发工作。
2.x 版本的事件创建逻辑本身没问题，同类日程 App 大多采用的也是类似的创建逻辑（包括 iOS 系统日历）。优点是创建流程清晰易懂，缺点是步骤稍显繁琐。
尤其对于复杂事件，常常需要多次往返于二级、甚至三级设置页面。
相较同类 App，Dislike 事件的日期、重复、提醒等设置更为灵活，这进一步加剧了 Dislike 2.x 版本创建事件的交互复杂度。
不破不立，3.0 版本推翻重构后的事件创建模块 ，所有设置项均可在 1 个页面内完成。
定制化的日期和时间控件，左右滑动可快速定位日期选择，双击返回今天。
提醒时间设置，起始、结束日期设置，重复设置…]]></summary>

背景
很久就一直想讲这个系列，那就是多线程，NIO，协程。如果看到这里，你就知道它们三个的因果关系，知道我想表达什么，那么你就不需要看这个系列了。如果你没明白，那么建议看下去。
内容
目前发布的是多线程原理，主要是使用现实例子，视频讲解应该是非常的通俗易懂了，使用送快递的例子进行类比，通俗讲解了线程池的原理，并且举例讲解公式推导的过程，小学生都可以推导出来的公式，非常的简单明了，所以叫做《小学篇》。
看完一遍之后，你应该不会忘记这个最大线程数的计算公式了，因为不需要记住了，随时随地就可以推导出来。
还有各种参数设置的场景也讲解了一遍，基本面试遇到后，再也不会被难到了。建议 3 年以下小伙伴都看看，会的就加深记忆，不会的就可以学习以下。
视频地址： https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PL411w7oQ/ 也希望大家帮我看看，是否有讲解不到位的地方，我回头再改改修正。
接下来
后面会继续创作讲解 NIO 服务，还有 Nio 编程，响应式编程，主要是偏 java 方法的技术。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。

WTCR是什么
讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。

拿到WTCR冠军有多难？
既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。

摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。

有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。

这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.

在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。

拿到这个冠军有什么意义？
一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。

在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。

中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。

对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。

对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。

而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧
先上个答案：会也不会
我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是17岁的时候拿的驾照买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车了，总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，应该是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的也有足够经验能说明问题
我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。
赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。
公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。
加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…
至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…
总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…

        <updated>2022-01-18T11:37:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、区位优势
青岛作为2020年北方又一个GDP破万亿的城市，除了旅游产业创造的价值，本身具备工业产业链，信息产业链的基础，海尔、海信等企业创造了一定基数的软件人才基数，一汽青岛，烟台现代等储备了一定当量的制造人才。
自然环境优越宜居，有一定当量的人才基础，房价还不高，很多一线城市被卷怕了的互联网，汽车人才是有可能去安家落户的。


二、北方经济增长点
目前郑州从发展的态势来说，由于交通的区位枢纽优势，整体的工业布局潜力要强于青岛，从GDP增速也可以看到。
尽管青岛作为全国 GDP 排名前十五的城市，后劲在哪里？从产业机构上来说，海尔海信并没有在青岛孵化更多的信息产业。而旅游业对自然环境的要求既是吸引人才的要素也是抑制大规模工业投资的，这可能会成为产业结构质量提升的掣肘。
青岛GDP发展的后劲就在利用人才优势绑定支柱产业创造新基建的产业价值，所以青岛需要高合，需要一个可能性来吸引更多的可能性。


三、高合需要青岛
目前的新势力的模式实际上已经逐渐成型了。
step 1.用国际一线资本实现从0到1的融资，也是背书。这是资源能力的体现。
step2.  合理合规的与地方国有资本促进产业升级的愿望契合并合作，实现区域的自然资源、社会资源、社会资本的整合（如合肥国资委对蔚来的投资，蔚来梦想工厂的落户。）
step3. 好好干，车卖得好了资本市场首先就会有反应，其次是地方的GDP对上下游产业链的拉动效应和人才的虹吸效应（exp:小米作为北京国资委2022年重点项目）
其实不止是汽车产业政府这么做，只是汽车产业动静比较大，对上下游的拉动能力比较强。


四、为什么是中国总部？
其实，还有世界总部、中国总部，软件中心、设计中心、营销中心都可以落户不同的地方，
获取不同区域的融资。这会是新势力融资的一种趋势，落户+产业合作与引进。
只要题材做的对，做的到位，产业链的拉动能够促进地方经济的体量和质量的发展，政府就愿意签约。
作为刚刚做过政府融资的HR。
政府引进产业、签署招商协议，绝对是有要求，有长远眼光，会有非常细致的GDP+税收的拉动要求的，而且这个钱不好拿。
但只要企业能够提供政府想要的价值，并且能够说到做到。分阶段的支持就会到来。


个人看法，青岛只是开始，今后，产业链相对完整、人才相对充裕的准一线，新一线城市会有更多的新势力落户，这符合国家的期待，也符合新基建的发展规律。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[制作「再读」播客的初心，是希望将它做成一种声音纪录片，如果几十年后的人们想了解当下世代人的所思所想，或许「再读」能成为他们的素材之一。
不过，现实总是比理想来得更早一些。我们制作过七期之后，发现播客制作起来并不如听上去的那样轻松，无论是选题上的取舍，还是录制时的临场发挥，都会影响到听众对节目的认知。
所以我们决定年末聚在一起，聊一聊如何做好一期「再读」播客。我们请到主播 @Shooca （当然也是 @重新想象Lab （微信公众号：rei-lab）专栏主理人），还有「再读」的前主播 @文刀漢三  ，来从不同角度发表看法。
为了让这次讨论加入听众的视角，我们也在录制前发出了问卷调查，根据问卷调查的结果，再来反思我们的制作方式。
「再读」是由少数派数字工具组出品的「读书会式」播客，以少数派发布的文章为线索，以播客的形式对文章中所讨论的话题和内容，进行延展和反思，以拓宽文章所涉及的范围。
如果您喜爱再读播客，并希望它持续更新，请在各平台留下您的评论，以表达对我们的支持。您的支持将是我们继续制作的重要动力。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[星链卫星影响的图像两年间增加了 35 倍

SpaceX 旗下“星链”互联网服务需要在轨运行密集的卫星群来提供低延迟网络连接服务。目前已有超过 1500 颗在轨卫星，美国 FCC 此前已经批准了 12000 颗星链卫星的发射。在过去的两年时间里，受星链卫星轨迹影响的图像数量 增加了 35 倍。研究人员估计，如果星链按计划发射所有卫星，几乎每一张观测图像中都至少有一条星链卫星的轨迹。SpaceX 在新一代星链卫星上安装了遮光罩，使卫星亮度下降了大约 4.6 倍，但仍然高于解决问题设定的目标。目前图像中的星链卫星轨迹细小，加之可以通过软件进行识别并处理，所以对天文观测的影响不算大。研究人员估计，目前而言，因为与星链卫星轨迹重合而导致错过罕见天文事件的概率只有 0.04%，但对黄昏观测影响最为严重。


老王点评：这一问题会随着卫星数量的增加而进一步恶化。




2021 年针对 Linux 的恶意软件增长了 35%

根据 一份报告，2021 年，针对 Linux 系统的恶意软件与 2020 年相比上升了 35%。XorDDoS、Mirai 和 Mozi 是最普遍的系列，占 2021 年观察到的所有针对 Linux 的恶意软件攻击的 22%。之前的 另外一份报告 也证实了这个增长趋势，发现 2020 年 Linux 恶意软件家族比前一年增加了 40%。


老王点评：从好的地方看，这代表 Linux 越来越流行了 🤣




FFmpeg 5.0 发布

FFmpeg 被多媒体应用广泛使用，其中之一是 VLC。在这个 版本 中，删除了大量废弃的 API，其中一些 API 甚至在 2013 年就被标识为废弃了，在这个版本之前已经有 4 年没有删除过废弃 API 了。所以如果你的应用使用了废弃 API 的话，请注意升级问题。除了 API 方面的变化，此版本还增加了许多功能，详情请参考 变更日志。此外，FFmpeg 将从 5.0 开始转向基于时间的发布节奏，预期每年都发布一个重大版本，以及每隔一年一个 LTS 版本，5.0 将是第一个 LTS 版本。


老王点评：虽然这个软件自己都没有个 GUI，但是却是很多华丽的多媒体应用的动力所在。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在医生开药的时候，和服药剂量一起告知的通常还有「药该怎么吃」。比如有些药必须要在饭后吃，有些要在早上吃，有些则在服药期间避免喝酒，而有些药好像完全没有服用的要求。但医生通常也不会解释原因。虽然「谨遵医嘱」所有人都该心知肚明，但患者吃药的时候难免心有不安，有些人甚至还会无视医生的指导，怀着「即使有些地方不遵从，药物还是会起效」的念头由自己的性子服药，就更别说在意饮食和生活方式的改变了。
可是，如果服药方式真的不会影响药效，医生为什么要强调呢？简单的一句医嘱背后，涉及的是服药方式可能影响的药物吸收、代谢与排泄，以及如何降低药物副作用，同时尽可能发挥药物最大的功效。这些都是经过大量科学研究验证得出的最优结论。
本文将简单介绍一些常见的药物服用要求，以及在服药时需要注意的食药相互作用，并在最后简单介绍「没有医嘱」时该怎么服药，希望能扫清你服药时的小小疑惑。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在职场工作几乎都会有团队之间的文件共享需求。对于办公文档这种小体积的文件，既可以使用一些在线文档工具实现协作和共享，也可以只是通过 IM 类软件进行分享。但如果文档数量很大，一些在线工具就无法满足大量的归类检索的需要了，这时候使用文件服务器来进行存储就显得更为方便。
而在实战中，大部分的企业也多使用通过权限管理的文件服务器来实现团队内的文件共享，一方面文件服务器的在局域网内，无论是读写拷贝等几乎没有延迟，适合团队内快速的分享和编辑。再者由于基于内网环境，具有很强的安全性。最后则是其使用起来非常简单，只需要创建 SMB 文件共享后采用网络驱动器映射，就可以直接在电脑上的文件资源管理器使用，大部分现代桌面操作系统都可以使用。

但如果团队因为各种原因导致异地办公，同时也无法在搭建一个文件服务器的话，如何以更低的形式实现上述的这种团队文件共享服务呢？笔者也恰好在近期遇到了类似的需求痛点——考虑到行政人员需要经常性查找行政文档、而产品和设计团队还需要查找原先的工程文件，如何低成本的打造一个大容量的「云文件服务器」迫在眉睫。
创建一个低成本的文件共享服务
因为团队已经转为异地办公且不再租赁任何办公场地，因此原本通过文件服务器托管+ zerotier 来实现虚拟局域网组网的方案已行不通，所以我思路就转换成了先将服务器中大量的文件上传到基于公有云的网盘中，然后再想办法将其映射成网络驱动器。由于公司原本的文件服务器是 1TB 左右的空间，因此需要选择的网盘的大小大概在 1TB 以上，并且需要免费不限速的网盘服务，所以这里可选择的并不多，好在阿里云盘基本满足需要。
将本地文件上传到共有云网盘服务中
下面的操作就是简单粗暴的文件上传，因为是第一次开通阿里云盘账号，所以云盘空间只有几百 GB，对于动辄上 TB 的文件数据量显然捉襟见肘，所以这里我还通过在手机端阿里云盘 App 做任务来扩充云盘体…]]></summary>

容器是现代计算的一个重要组成部分，随着围绕容器的基础设施的发展，新的和更好的工具开始浮出水面。过去，你只需用 LXC 就可以运行容器，然而随着 Docker 得到了普及，它开始变得越来越复杂。最终，我们在 Podman 得到了我们所期望的容器管理系统：一个无守护进程的容器引擎，它使容器和吊舱易于构建、运行和管理。

容器直接与 Linux 内核能力（如控制组和命名空间）交互，它们在这些命名空间中产生大量的新进程。简而言之，运行一个容器实际上就是在 Linux 系统内部运行一个 Linux 系统。从操作系统的角度来看，它看起来非常像一种管理和特权活动。普通用户通常不能像容器那样自由支配系统资源，所以默认情况下，运行 Podman 需要 root 或 sudo 权限。然而，这只是默认设置，而且这绝不是唯一可用的设置。本文演示了如何配置你的 Linux 系统，使普通用户可以在不使用 sudo 的情况下（“无根rootless”）运行 Podman。

命名空间的用户 ID

内核命名空间 本质上是一种虚构的结构，可帮助 Linux 跟踪哪些进程属于同一类。这是 Linux 中的“队列护栏”。一个队列中的进程与另一个队列中的进程之间实际上没有区别，但可以将它们用“警戒线”彼此隔离。要声明一组进程为“容器”，而另一组进程为你的操作系统，将它们分开是关键。

Linux 通过用户 ID（UID）和组 ID（GID）来跟踪哪个用户或组拥有的进程。通常情况下，一个用户可以访问一千个左右的从属 UID，以分配给命名空间的子进程。由于 Podman 运行的是分配给启动容器的用户的整个从属操作系统，因此你需要的不仅仅是默认分配的从属 UID 和从属 GID。

你可以用 usermod 命令授予一个用户更多的从属 UID 和从属 GID。例如，要授予用户 tux 更多的从属 UID 和从属 GID，选择一个还没分配用户的适当的高 UID（如 200000），然后将其增加几千：

$ sudo usermod \
    --add-subuids 200000-265536 \
    --add-subgids 200000-265536 \
    tux


命名空间访问

对命名空间数量也有限制。这通常被设置得很高。你可以用 systctl，即内核参数工具来验证用户的命名空间分配：

$ sysctl --all --pattern user_namespaces
user.max_user_namespaces = 28633


这是很充足的命名空间，而且可能是你的发行版默认设置的。如果你的发行版没有这个属性或者设置得很低，那么你可以在文件 /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf 中输入这样的文本来创建它：

user.max_user_namespaces=28633


加载该设置：

$ sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf


在没有 root 权限的情况下运行一个容器

当你设置好你的配置，重启你的计算机，以确保你的用户和内核参数的变化被加载和激活。

重启后，试着运行一个容器镜像：

$ podman run -it busybox echo "hello"
hello


容器像命令一样

如果你是第一次接触容器，可能会觉得很神秘，但实际上，它们与你现有的 Linux 系统没有什么不同。它们实际上是在你的系统上运行的进程，没有仿真环境或虚拟机的成本和障碍。容器和你的操作系统之间的区别只是内核命名空间，所以它们实际上只是带有不同标签的本地进程。Podman 使这一点比以往更加明显，当你将 Podman 配置为无根命令，容器感觉更像命令而不是虚拟环境。Podman 使容器和吊舱变得简单，所以请试一试。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #效率 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢 「用产品思维解构生活」 的，花生酱。你也可以叫我 Jeff。
2022 年的我，是一枚 7 岁的产品经理，也是一个公众号的主理人，同时还是一名效率产品领域的作家。我曾对信息获取、方法论总结如痴如狂，却从未对 「获得信息」 感到满足。
截止到去年，我已经读了产品领域 90% 的书籍，订阅了 500+ 公众号及付费阅读产品，并且还在持续每周花 50 小时在电子设备上摄取内容。但我仍然觉得空虚，焦虑，以及，不满足。
海量的信息在我脑海飘过，我害怕错失任何一点点 「有用」 的部分，试图抓住全部，却几乎遗忘了全部。
但最近半年，我好多了。
我重新审视了自己的工具、方法，以及自己对信息的期待、和信息的关系，进而找到了一些蛛丝马迹，并进一步对自己的 「效率生活」 进行了重构，终于和 「信息处理」 步入了近乎 「握手言和」 的阶段。
所以，这篇文章，想讲讲这一路的心得，供君参考。
从 「刚下飞机」 聊起
不记得什么时候开始，「刚下飞机」，已经成为了一个经典的时间点。
这种叙事来自于：「万物互联」 和 「移动化」 这两件事，已经把我们的生活搬到了飞速向前的生产线滑轨上。而 「飞机上」 这个断网的环境，或许是现阶段共识的、唯一可以打破这种互联的场景。所以 「刚下飞机」 这样的表述，多多少少表现出，我们对 「飞速向前和海量信息」 的应对方式（至少我），是略显被动和僵硬的。
信息太多，没有办法专心。概念太多，没有办法熟悉。更多的情况下，我们被 「无…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是 Linux 走向大众最重要的一件事。




你可能看过 最近 Linus Tech Tips 关于切换到 Linux 的视频，以及 他对 KDE 软件的一些抱怨的那个视频。对于那些关注此事的人，我想让你们知道，我们（KDE）正在努力修复 Linus 提出的问题，你们可以在 这里 跟踪我们的进展。值得庆幸的是，大部分的问题都相当小，应该很容易解决。

关于桌面 Linux 需要什么才能成为主流的问题。Sway 开发者 Drew DeVault 针对该视频发表了一篇文章，而这篇博文是我的版本。Drew 强调了可访问性，我也同意，但结论略有不同。

桌面 Linux 需要预装在零售硬件上才能在主流市场取得成功

就是这样。

请允许我解释一下。

人们经常被功能和可用性所困扰，这些都很重要，但它们只是达到目的的手段，本身并不是目的。如果人们根本不能得到它，质量就毫无意义。而如果没有可访问的发行版，人们就无法得到它。高质量的 Linux 发行版还不够；它们需要被预装在你可以在主流零售店买到的硬件产品上。“主流人群”会购买他们可以触摸和拿起的产品；如果在主流商店找不到它，它就不存在。

想一想，为什么普通人都使用 Windows 或 macOS？因为他们购买的实体电脑包含了它。iOS 或 Android 呢？它被默认装在了他们的实体智能手机上。对于“主流人群”来说，不存在用一个新的操作系统替换设备的操作系统的想法。只有 “三点”用户 才会这么做，而他们只占市场的 5% 左右。如果获得你的操作系统的唯一途径是自己安装，那么你就没有机会在主流市场取得成功。



至于功能，人们通常只使用可用功能的很小的一部分。在可用性方面，大多数用户是 记住他们的软件如何使用而不是理解它 —— 如果你真的需要，你可以记住任何东西。一个更好的用户界面会有所帮助，但是对于那些记忆这些的人来说并不是必需的，而它主要有利于那些能够识别模式，并欣赏逻辑、一致性和良好设计的高级用户（市场上 30% 的“二点及以上”人群）。因此，这些东西本身就不够好。

但这并不意味着我们应该忘记功能和可用性！一点也不。但是如果我们的目标是“走向主流”，我们就必须了解真正的受众：是硬件供应商，而不是终端用户。我们的目标是让软件产品有足够的吸引力，以便在供应商选购时被他们选中，因为它基本上就是这样做的。像苹果这样为知名产品定制自上而下的硬件和软件的公司很少。大多数公司都建立在第三方软件之上，这些软件需要他们内部软件团队进行最少的整合和定制工作。如果你的软件不能胜任，他们会转向下一个选择。因此，当一些硬件供应商有需求时，你的软件最好已经准备好了！

而硬件供应商需要什么？


灵活性。你的软件必须容易适应他们的任何类型的设备，而不需要大量的定制工程，他们将在产品的生命周期中负责支持。

能使他们的设备看起来不错的功能。对其物理硬件特性的支持、良好的性能、令人愉快的用户界面……人们购买它的理由基本上是这些。

稳定性。不能崩溃并将用户抛弃在命令行终端提示符下。必须可以实际工作。不能让人感觉像一个业余的科学展览会项目。

可用性要足够好，以减少支持成本。当出现问题时，“主流人群”会联系他们的硬件供应商。可用性需要足够好，以便尽可能少地发生这种情况。


它不需要完美。它只需要做这些事情。这就是 Windows 在 90 年代征服了个人电脑市场的方式，尽管它很糟糕！而我们的东西要好得多！

我看到有证据表明 KDE 已经是这样了。Pine 在 PinePhone 和 PineBook Pro 上分别为 Manjaro 提供了 Plasma 的移动版和桌面版。Valve 也为 Steam Deck 选择了 Plasma 的桌面版，在他们的新版 SteamOS 中取代了 GNOME。我认为 KDE 软件定位良好，并且一直在变得更好。因此，让我们继续加倍努力提供硬件供应商销售其出色产品所需的东西。

In this post, we are going to find out the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of backend and frontend development uses of frontend and backend development and many more. So if you like our post and want more posts like this then don't forget to share our post with your blogger friends.
Front-end development is used to create interfaces of websites that users see like the navbar, header, footer, and the whole web page. They have to create the mockup of the web page, they have to design the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt and more their different categories in front end development like web page designer, UI, and UX designer, and more. In UI designing the designer has to create the mockup of a web page using some popular tools like Figma, Adobe XD. If you want to know about the most popular UI designing tools then you can visit this post link. The full form of UI means User Interface and in UX designing the designer has to decide how beautiful the design looks they also provide suggestions. For example, this button will look more beautiful if we add a border to it, etc. The full form of UX is User Experience. In simple words, a front-end developer is the one who focuses on the design and the looks of the web page. Some of the popular frameworks and libraries that front end developer use are -
jQuery or React (library)
Angular or Vue JS (framework)
Tailwind CSS (framework) or Bootstrap 4 or 5 (library)
Advantages of frontend development
Secured
Speedy development
Easy to learn
Good for attracting users' for more sales
Disadvantages of frontend development
Can only be used to create static websites
Code Inflation
Higher Supply than demand

SASS is a preprocessor scripting language and it mainly has two syntaxes one is the original syntax and the other one is the indented syntax which uses a similar syntax like HAML. It was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum and after that Eppstein also joined Natalie Weizenbaum and extended it using SassScript. It first appeared on November 28, 2006, and its stable version was 3.5.6 which was launched on March 23, 2018. It is also known as SCSS and web develo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have developed a small social network web app for educational purpose and want to share this with the community. This app is built with ReactJS for frontend, Java Spring Boot for backend and MongoDB as the database.
The app tries to mimic a few functions of Twitter, including:
Create post with text and image
The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters
Like, comment and re-post a post
View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post
Comments are toggle
The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters
Follow, un-follow someone
See who are following us and follow them back
Check who we are following
View all posts of an individual
View our own posts
List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)
Other functions:
Due to limited storage space, client app compresses the uploaded image to the maximum of 250px (width or height) User avatar is created by hashing user id and convert that hash code into a hexagonal image
Authentication and authorization use JWT
Responsive frontend for desktop and mobile devices
Technical stack:
Frontend: ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Bootstrap
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Database: MongoDB
Hope you enjoy it and give me a ⭐ Github star ⭐ for my effort!

Even stranger was the fact that when I run eslint by itself in the commandline, it doesn't show that anything was wrong:
eslint --cache --format stylish --ext '.js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx' --quiet ./

What gives?

touch command to the rescue. In order to force webpack to recompile the files, they had to be changed somehow, and I wasn't prepared to manually change each file by hand, recompile, and revert the change, just to wait for another recompilation.
I simply used the touch command on Linux to "touch" all the files which were having that problem, like so:
touch src/pages/**/*.{js,jsx,tsx,ts}

shell is zsh
After running this command, webpack was forced to recompile everything and I no longer saw those pesky errors again.]]></summary>

我还记得自己第一次见到 Surface Laptop Go 是在北京三里屯的一家顺电。对自己的 MacBook Pro 早已审美疲劳的我，说实话，对 Surface 系列的设计一直都是十分欣赏的。3:2 的 12.4 英寸屏幕比例、舒适的键盘和触控板，以及触摸屏 —— Surface Laptop Go 符合一切我对于上网本的期待。只不过，当时的我只是简简单单的欣赏，并没有什么购买欲。
情况在今年发生了改变。首先是，我把用了多年的 2016 款 13 英寸 MacBook Pro 出掉了，换了 M1 的 Mac mini 作为日常使用的 Mac 机器。这是因为，尽管 MacBook Pro 十分便携，它的性能早已跟不上我的需要了。至于移动办公的需求，单位配发的 Dell Latitude 7390 实际上体验尚可，如果它不是那么快就坏掉了的话。
LOL，线过于杂乱，请勿介意
如今的轻薄笔记本，其实有不少的选择。一来，MacBook Air 因为配备了 M1 处理器而变得性能强劲且续航优秀；二来，在 Windows 阵营，联想小新、小米、华为等一众国产品牌推出的轻薄款笔记本无论是性能还是价格都还不错。至于我为什么最终选择了 Surface Laptop Go，主要原因是这样的：首先，我也已经提到了我对这款笔记本的设计钟爱有加。考虑到 12.4 英寸 3:2 的屏幕，它看起来小巧精致，但是在内容的显示上倒是也毫不含糊，相比 16:9 或者 16:10 的传统比例，能够显示的内容更多。其次，最近对于 Excel 的高需求，让我无法安心使…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


We use JavaScript objects to store data and retrieve it later. We store data(aka information) in key-value pairs. The key-value pair is also known as the object properties. 
Here is an employee object with three properties: id, name, dept as keys and 007, 'James', and 'Spy' as values.
const employee = {
  id: 007,
  name: 'James',
  dept: 'Spy'
}

Since ES6(ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript provides a mechanism to handle the properties of objects in a much more innovative way. The mechanism is called Destructuring(also known as destructuring assignment). It is more of a new syntax added to the language than a feature.

背景交待：新房交付，要在新家配置好一堆智能设备，比如智能门锁、新风机、监控等等。而且新小区的蜂窝信号不是特别好，急需一条宽带解决网的问题，预计半年之后才会搬家。
接着，去联通申请了一条 1000Mbps 的宽带，赠送了一个所谓价值 2400 元的哇为光猫路由器+扩展器，但条件是我必须承诺在网 2 年，否则收回设备或赔偿损失。
这个光猫路由 2 合 1 的设备，其实就是个 10Gbps 的光猫，自带 WiFi 功能，支持 2.4GHz 与 5GHz ，然后可以输出一条光纤连接至一个光纤分线器，再接另外一个类似 WiFi 放大器的设备。
原本我只是想凑合一段时间（租的房子在用小米 AX6000 ，想着搬过去继续用），直接用这台赠送的哇为光猫配置家里的智能设备，可进了光猫后台发现，想改 SSID ，它默认一定要有个 CU_的前缀，这就没法与我现在的 SSID 保持一致，到时候很多设备都没法直接联网，就很麻烦。
等安装完成，我测了一下速度，直接连接 5GHz 的热点，实测速度仅有 500Mbps 左右，我就觉得这光猫性能不太行。于是去小米之家买了台 AX9000 ，直接连接光猫，再测速，目前是 850Mbps 左右，还是没达到 1000Mbps 。
我就问联通的宽带安装师傅，这光猫支持桥接吗，我想直接用路由拨号。师傅说，这是一批什么 FTTR 设备，要问问技术部门的才知道能否开通桥接模式。
至此，觉得这个所谓的 2400 元哇为，水分非常大。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today...
Watch the Event Capture, Propagation and Bubbling video from Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 program. If you want to code along with the video, you can use the contents of folder #25 from the repo you cloned above.
I found this video to be very interesting because Event Propagation is definitely something I've never encountered before or wouldn't have know about firsthand. 
As much as I liked Wes's explanation of Event Bubbling in the video, I was still unsure of what was happening. I went ahead and Googled for more information about it. I think the GeeksOnGeeks definition captures it really well:
"Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements".
Event Bubbling triggers a selection of all associated elements, a rippling effect. However, not all events bubble.
An image from javascript.info was a good visual example of the effect.

Event Bubbling can be stopped using the stopPropagation() on the event.

BUT DON'T STOP BUBBLING UNLESS NEEDED!
Next, the video went over Event Capturing which is another phase of Event Propagation ("Event propagation is a way to describe the “stack” of events that are fired in a web browser.*)
Unlike Event Bubbling, Event Capturing starts from the top-down to the element. Event Propagation has three phases:
Capture Phase
Target Phase
Bubbling Phase

The capture phase is rarely used and is implemented by setting the handler "capture" option to true.

不知道发游戏区还是路由器区，之所以发这里，是因为我综合各种状况猜测有可能是路由器问题吧。
首先是用 Moonlight 串流 PC ，内网串流一切正常，外网的话虽然能正常连接上 PC(已经打开画面了)，但是只要动一下鼠标(也就是在手机屏幕上滑一下、按一下)就会很快自动断开串流链接。 不过如果不碰屏幕，链接倒是可以一直维持……
因为最近我重装电脑系统了，以为是电脑有什么问题，显卡驱动问题或者是 Moonlight 软件有问题。
后来发现 PS4 串流也有类似问题！内网串流没问题，外网一连上几秒就断……不管手机操不操作都会断。后来才想起之前路由器也换了，现在是 OpenWrt 系统的软路由
以下是我掌握的情况：
1 、外网网络绝对是正常，并且能完美达到串流要求的。
2 、我是熟悉外网串流的要求的，有公网 IP ，各种端口也按要求转发了，DDNS 做好了，以前也是能正常串流的；
3 、更换过多个客户端设备(不同品牌的手机，电脑)，问题依旧；
4 、用微软自带的 RemoteDesktop 在外网远程连接 PC ，一切正常；
5 、测试了用梯子连回家里的网络后再串流，一切正常；
6 、OpenWrt 上是开了梯，但是尝试过开过它，并不影响结果。  
综合以上，我只能怀疑是不是路由器 OpenWrt 的问题了。 鉴于 Moonlight 串流只要一操作就断开链接的症状，我猜是不是路由器对于入网的数据有什么限制，防火墙有什么奇怪的阻挡之类的……
不知道我这种奇怪又不明确的情况有没有大佬有头绪的？]]></summary>

现在手持苹果，一方面没法通话录音，另一方面由于有两个微信，有时候需要双开，所以想买个安卓备用机，由于很久没玩安卓了，也不知道现在刷机这方面变成什么样了，特来问问。
1.预算大概 3000 以内，当然 2000 左右是最好的
2.128G 存储，之前看我妈的 64g 手机，看占用只用了 40G+，但实际上已经接近满了，差出来的空间都快能装两个手机系统了，所以最好还是 128g
3.只玩部落冲突，所以对于游戏的要求几乎为 0
4.长续航
5.能够刷国际版系统或者本身是暂未沦陷的国外品牌，实在扛不住小米的‘全链路反诈’，我估计小米就是先锋，今年没什么大动静，明年 ov 华为荣耀这些都要跟进了，干脆不装国内系统。
6.内存不太懂了，我上一个安卓还是 nexus 6p ，好像是 4G ，还算够用，不知道现在如何。
多谢推荐
我随便看了下 k40 好像不错，就是不知道系统能不能刷国际版，难度如何。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[去年这个时候我写了一篇关于日本威士忌的文章，算是入门科普帖（没看过的可以先戳进去预习一下）。
发布后反响有点出乎意料地好，看来当时对日威有兴趣的人就已经不少，生活也确实需要偶尔喝点小酒放松一下。
所以今天继续来聊聊日威，能为自己喜欢的东西写上一篇攻略性的文章，是一件快乐的事儿。



这一年里日威的热度依旧蹭蹭上涨，现在国内的酒吧或是酒店行政酒廊里没放几瓶日威都撑不起场面，唱衰日威的人又被打脸了。



口说无凭，来看2021年WWA（人称威士忌奥斯卡）的评选结果。日本秩父酒厂的调和威士忌又又又拿奖了，这是它的第四次蝉联。



不过决定写日威第二弹其实还有个契机在。南泊山的老板和菜菜是好朋友，所以我们编辑也会时不时去店里写（摸）稿（鱼），顺便喝咖啡。



前几天正好遇到店里在做特调新品咖啡，场面过于精彩，差点以为自己在看调酒。一问用的是日威，我心里直呼：老板真舍得下本啊！偷偷往柜台看了一眼，用的是知多。
老板说1.0版本用的是苏威，但后来还是决定用日威，毕竟它自带“流量”。



厚脸皮蹭了一杯，入口有一种陌生又熟悉的感觉。酒体强烈的风味并没有盖住咖啡的香气和奶香味，反而让奶咖的味道变得有棱角。一口一口地品，还没过瘾，杯子就见底了。



另外还有两款特调，名字也有意思。
「人间清醒」，高浓度埃塞俄比亚花魁soe，搭配上经过与黄糖融合灼烧过的松井，非常硬核。
「梅空见你」，若鹤梅酒搭配青梅露，加冰雪克，香槟杯做盐边，加入苏打水，最后淋上低浓度的冰的水洗埃塞俄比亚耶加雪菲手冲。
如果你在杭州，可以改天带爱喝酒的朋友一起去品品。日威做特调，是真的下血本。





傍晚走出咖啡店的时候，不得不再次感慨日威确实一年比一年出息。虽然今年在WWA上拿的世界性奖项远不如往年多，但在讨论热度上日威明显已经压了苏威一头。



照这趋势，起步晚于苏格兰、美国、爱尔兰和加拿大的世界第五大…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写成都怎么住，我是有发言权的。因为我可以很负责任的说，今天提到的酒店，我去过85%以上。
住的多，自然推荐起来也会更加的有理有据一些。



关于成都怎么住？我是这么看的...
1）如果你是去成都旅行的，也之前是没怎么去过成都的，我会建议你住在成都1环内。
成都绝大部分的景点，都在一环内（或一环边上）。所以如果你住在一环内的话，去哪里旅行可都是很方便的。
绝对绝对不要超过成都的二环。



但如果你是多刷成都，多住住一环外也是不错的。
例如想去熊猫基地的，附近有皇冠假日；想去泡温泉的，金堂有美憬阁；想去青城山的，六善和SLH的青城山尊都不错；都江堰则是有宋品别墅。



2）住新不住旧，一家酒店的最佳入住时间是开业半年到开业六年内。
举个例子，我之前去成都喜欢住君悦，主要是位置好、吃的好、性价比也高，还能让我刷凯悦的SNP。
后来有一次去成都，偶尔住了瑯珀·凯悦臻选后，我发现瑯珀明显更香啊。真不是君悦不好，是瑯珀更好。



3）按照档次来推荐（仅成都市区）
第一档：博舍、钓鱼台
第一点五档：海湾大酒店、尧棠公馆、瑯珀·凯悦臻选
第二档：君悦、希尔顿嘉悦里、华尔道夫、W、丽思、瑞吉、环球中心天堂洲际、费尔蒙、万达瑞华、协信中心希尔顿、成都希尔顿
第三档：其它五星酒店
国宾馆：成都金牛宾馆
老字号：四川锦江宾馆
如果是成都的外围，青城山六善、青城山尊（凯悦悠选旗下），都江堰的宋品别墅（有温泉），官塘安麓、金堂美憬阁（有温泉）、黑龙滩的洲际和英迪格都是不错的。



说完方法论，接下来是推荐：
1）根据周边景点来推荐
成都酒店有一点特别好。就是每个景点边上，总会有一家值得住的酒店。所以在订酒店的时候，你就看你想去哪里浪，然后就订边上的酒店。



宽窄巷子，钓鱼台
在成都，有两家酒店的位置极好。一家是宽窄巷子里的钓鱼台，另外一家是太古里的博舍。都是闹中取静的好去处。
宽窄巷子是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
收到我人生最大的一笔单篇稿费的这天晚上，我失眠了。
当然不是因为钱多烧的，而是白天咖啡喝多了 2021 年最后一篇稿子赚来的稿酬成功让我回想起了成为少数派作者的这一年。
我是 Leslie，一个致力于让没有医学背景的人听懂医生在说啥的科普作者，一年以前，我还只是一个潜水的小透明，现在却混进了少数派的作者群。不过和作者群里两百多个大佬不一样，我不太厉害。在「高效工作」领域，我是个吊车尾，不会编程，不会拆电脑修手机，不会摄影，不会录播客，不会剪视频；在「品质生活」方面，我不会马伽术，不会做厉害的咖啡或是诱人的饭菜，不会种菜，不会俄语，没有惊人的读书量和阅片量，去过的地方也很少。在以上知识技能和经历方面相信很多读者都可以来无情地碾压我。而且我还是个内向的「社恐」。
但你既然已经读到了这篇文章，说明我对这个社区还是有一点点价值的。一直以来我写的多是具体的医学健康话题，这次，我想讲点柔软的，讲讲在成为了少数派作者的这一年，我这样的普通人在坚持写作之后，在网络上终于开始 reach out 之后，有了什么样的改变和思考。希望可以鼓励到和我有着类似渴望或相同困境的读者。
在关系中成长——和编辑的故事
正如《也许你该找个人聊聊》的作者所说，人和人是在关系中成长的。
我向来习惯在现实生活和社交网络中对陌生人保持缄默，而在少数派上写稿、加入作者群，让我产生了新的和人的联结，我认识了好多编辑，有的勇敢，有的善良，有的很宽容，有的很硬汉。在这样的交流中我除了交了十几篇稿子之外，也渐渐地变得没那么社恐了。
故事开始于去年的一月，我和很多小伙伴一样，新年伊始就立了 flag。我在朋友圈公然大放厥词：新年目标是写 50 篇科普。准备重新捡起没咋更过的公众号，但公众号完全没人关注，不如找个读者群优质的地方发发看？出于侥幸心理，我申请了 Matrix 社区写作权限。彼时我还没读到老麦的深漂回顾，还不知…]]></summary>

stop-mess-around
项目介绍
减少摸鱼的时间和频率的 Chrome 插件：在上班 /学习期间很容易下意识的打开摸鱼网站，插件帮助我们减少摸鱼的时间和频率，提高我们上班和学习的效率，节省时间用于学习提升自己或者享受生活。
插件功能
匹配摸鱼网址
打开网页后，插件会自动匹配自己配置的摸鱼网站。
成功匹配后，弹出提示信息，提示用户关闭摸鱼网站。
如果觉得疲惫了，也可以选择休息一下。

网站摸鱼检测关闭，摸鱼休息时间提醒
当你关闭摸鱼网站检测时，会在摸鱼网站的右侧有一个倒计时提醒以及摸鱼时间统计。
如果不需要，这项配置可以在插件的管理面板的设置中关闭的。

近百日摸鱼时间统计表
插件会统计近一百天的摸鱼数据，超过一百天则会被删掉。
每天会根据摸鱼耗时进行排序，会统计摸鱼休息时间的点击情况。
如果提前关闭摸鱼，会返回剩余的摸鱼时间

插件管理面板
点击插件图标，打开插件管理模板，对插件进行配置。

在线 VSCode 快速查看仓库代码
现在查看 Github 仓库代码，可以直接把github.com/仓库地址改成github.dev/仓库地址(官方)和github1s.com/地址，这两种形式来使用在线版的 VSCode 来查看。
在github1s这个插件看到这个小功能，因为确实蛮实用的，也不想再装插件了，想着把它也集成到本插件中
插件直接把按钮显示在仓库名旁边，这样在wiki、actions、issues、Pull Request等页面也可以使用
支持github.dev(默认)以及github1s，可以去（插件管理面板 => 设置）更改
PS：我以前都是用Octotree文件树来查看代码的，现在感觉可以把这个插件删掉了 哈哈，还是直接用在线 VSCode 比较香

点个 Star 吧~
如果觉得这个插件还不错，对你有所帮助的话，就点个Star⭐️吧~
插件的价值与使用场景
就我个人而言，真的很有用，很有效果。帮我抵制了摸鱼网站的诱惑，减少了摸鱼的时间与频率，为我节省了很多时间。
摸鱼时起到提醒的作用，在摸鱼的时候知道自己在摸鱼。
匹配摸鱼网站有弹窗提醒，关闭摸鱼检测又有倒计时和摸鱼时长统计。
在摸鱼的时候知道自己摸鱼，休息好之后，就又可以投入学习和工作了。
而不是下意识的打开网页浏览摸鱼网站，因为奶头乐比较爽，然后一看就是好几个小时过去了，事后又会觉得内疚与空虚。
自制力较差的同学，想要提高工作和学习的效率，但是又经常摸鱼，
自制力差的同学可以用工具来对抗诱惑，摸鱼的快乐很容易让人沉迷。
从而导致工作和学习的效率并不高。
插件使用时间久了，自然而然也会降低自己摸鱼的频率和时间的。
摸鱼少了，工作和学习的效率就高了。
节省下来的时间，可以用于学习提升自己或者享受生活（早点下班，去阅读，去健身，去吃喝玩乐，做任何自己喜欢的事情）。
需要稍微奋斗卷一下的时候，希望自己减少点摸鱼。
比如需求截止时间要到了，希望自己减少点摸鱼。
比如某段时间比较忙，希望自己减少点摸鱼。
比如要忙着毕设、期末考试等，希望自己减少点摸鱼
奋斗逼、卷王
这类同学不多说了，懂得都懂。😂
后记
鉴于上次刚开源宣传(我用来阻止你摸鱼看沸点、知乎和微博的 Chrome 插件)的时候，因为不让大家摸鱼，被大伙儿“举报”、怒斥为“资本家的走狗” 。
我真的希望这个开源工具可以有效的帮助有需要的同学减少摸鱼时间，提高工作和学习的效率。
我说这么多的意思不是在“洗地”，大伙儿别再“举报”我了 我是友军 😂
我的其他开源推荐
koroFileHeader
它是用于一键生成文件头部注释并自动更新最后编辑人和编辑时间、函数注释自动生成和参数提取。
插件支持所有主流语言,功能强大，配置灵活方便，文档齐全，食用简单！
插件从 2018 年 5 月维护至今, 3K+ Star ，关闭 issue 300+
目前拥有 250K+的用户，VSCode 图表统计日安装用户 100 多-400 多人，帮助用户养成良好的编码习惯，规范整个团队风格。
自动生成头部注释以及自动更新头部注释

函数注释参数生成以及参数自动提取

AutoCommit
这是一个用于 Git 自动 commit 的 VSCode 插件，它可以用来补充之前忘记提交 commit ，帮助你把首页的绿色格子填满。

上周末，为了控制小孩看电子产品的时间，将家里的平板、手机、电视等进行了归纳，偶然间翻出了一个小箱子。这个箱子里，存了我很多年前的记忆，如果不是翻出来，或许我都已经忘了吧。
还记得那是一个下着小雨的傍晚
我们在五道口的一家商场吃晚餐
来北京挺久了却是我们初次见面
那天我们吃的是烤肉吧还是火锅
五年的记忆两人却陷入相望无言
好想说一句你瘦了变得更好看了
可在这样的时刻去夸你太残忍了
本以为是我先打破这可怕的沉默
百度离你住的很近你确定不去吗
是哦我住在八号线朱辛庄西二旗
此行的目的原本就是奔着他来的
可是我想留北京的意图你知道吧
到了这个份上知不知道还重要吗
是或不是去或不去有什么意义吗
站在星巴克门口看着这人来人往
小雨戚戚沥沥似乎在诉说着往事
天不早了我该回去了你也早点走
你和我就这样站着不说话看天空
想留不能留才最寂寞竟是这滋味
广场大妈送过来一把透明的雨伞
十块一把却是我见过最美的浪漫
我将你送上了计程车目送你远去
雨水湿了我的眼眶世界也被淹没
现在这把伞就藏在这个小盒子里
透明的简单的做工粗糙却很好看
伞下面还有硬盘显卡以及火车票
如今写代码的感觉终于就像写诗
我居然真的当程序员八年如青丝
这张卡已经在这里躺了七年有余
与其躺着吃灰舍不得扔不如送人
也好了却这桩心事不再睹物思人
总不该早已相忘江湖还怨天尤人]]></summary>

This page is meant to be a resource of the most common things I end up linking to people as they are learning web dev. It should be short so it doesn't overwhelm people.
2022 Web Dev Getting Started/Career Guide Video - MANDATORY WATCHING
MarkSheet - HTML/CSS/Sass
JSFiddle - Use this when you are having trouble getting code to work and need help from someone
CodePen - Create an account. Use this for stuff you want to keep track of, or to search for existing examples.
Free Code Camp - Bootstrap, JS, and more
Can I Use - Tells you what browser support specific web features have.
Learn Chrome Dev Tools - Basically the same for other browsers as well.
Why learning to code is so…]]></summary>

因为都是服务国内，所有主要考虑香港节点，但是香港似乎也不自由了，那只能新加坡，东京或者美西吧，

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newyorkcity: 我买了个一出（连着显示器）二进（两台不同电脑）的 HDMI 中间件，可以通过按下中间件上按钮快速切换输出到显示器上的电脑。
然而公司的笔记本不论是插进口 1 还是进口 2 ，都无法显示。进口只有它一个也无法显示。
将笔记本的多屏（ Win+P ）设置为扩展时，表现为就要变成扩展的样子了，但卡了一下 duang 弹回只有一屏幕的样子，又一小会儿又要表现为显示双屏的模式，又卡一下只有单屏。一直这样循环。
而我自己的笔记本不论哪个进口都是可以正常显示的。
公司的笔记本就是那种批量采购的联想 ThinkPad ，同时系统内置了一些网络访问控制（不能访问 github 之类的）。
难道公司的笔记本还能检测 HDMI 输出的目标？可 HDMI 中间件本质也不过是个桥接的元器件吧，最终检测到的不应该还是显示屏？
最离谱的是这个笔记本我带回家，单纯接自己买的显示器，也是可以正常显示的，没啥问题。（接自己家里的显示器时没有 HDMI 中间件）也就是说这个笔记本应该没检测输出设备是不是公司设备的能力，不然我自己的显示器啥配置都没做过，凭啥好好工作。。
那我的怀疑对象又变到了连着显示器的那根线，这根线是公司提供的，是 HDMI 转 DVI （是的，公司的显示器只有 DP,DVI 和 VGA 三种口，没有 HDMI ）线。。可是这也不对啊，我自己的笔记本不论接哪个口都能正常显示。在两个进口都用上的情况下，我自己的笔记本也是正常的双屏。
真得想不通问题能是啥。。
有没有可能只是 HDMI 中间件的问题？我换个牌子再买个试试？

Satellite-X is a private company that offers consumers personal satellites. The purchase of a personal, private satellite includes launching it into a stable low-earth orbit, and a 5 year guarantee for it to remain in orbit and functional.

2 ，在 pve 后台里的 ssh 里，输入命令：qm start 100 ，就有声音。
经过查询，有人在 pve 论坛问过此事：

通常我们直通核显连电视，基本都在 win10 里操作了，如果 win10 更新什么的，顺手重启一下虚拟机，这下好了，重启之后没有声音了，非得另开一台电脑，登录 pve 后台，ssh 进去，qm start 100 这样才能有声音。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I would like to share my experience with Moti animation and create a Wave indicator using reanimated 2 and Moti.
https://snack.expo.dev/@abdelhalimahmed/live-wave-animation

What's the Moti?
In my current job, I got a task with a little animation like the above demo and I was thinking what's the easiest way to do it, actually, my first glance is creating it using Lottie, but I said why? let's do it with Reanimated 2 which it's my favorite performant animation library in the meantime.
hint: I used styled-components, but you can use any preferred UI library
1- I created a static dot component with fixed height and width with half border-radius "Circle"
const Dot = styled.View'


2- Add array with length 3 which contain Animated view waves with the same style of Dot and positioning 'absolute'
const Wave = styled(Animated.View)'


3- Animation Part: 

const animationValue = useSharedValue(0); 


That's IT 🔥🥳
But one Second!, where is the Moti Here?
Okay, After I finished the task and when streaming youtube I found Catalin Miron "who's building awesome animation using react native, I recommend checking his channel" released a new video very close to my animation challenge but he used the Motie!, so I mapped his code to fit my challenge and the result is awesome! with a few lines of my code!.
import {View} from '@motify/components';

Hola a todos, hoy he decidido avanzar con mi pagina personal, realmente me entusiasma pero hoy no he podido avanzar mucho por temas familiares. 
La sección principal ha tomado algo de forma ya que le he agregado estilos y he practicado algo de typescript aunque no he conseguido resultados mas altos en mi velocidad que los de la semana pasada. He estado realizando los test y aprendiendo en esta pagina.
He estado pensando que podría retomar mi estudio de typescript y aprender algún framework de css pero aun no he decidido realmente y estoy enfocado en avanzar con mi pagina.
Espero que tengas mucho éxito con tus proyectos y animo con todo. ¡Tu puedes!
Adiós mundo.

Here goes...
I was introduced to programming by a friend, November 2021. I had no prior knowledge about it so I was scared. Did i have the brain capacity to understand any of the languages? I didn't think so
Fast forward to today, I am currently waiting on a Programming scholarship worth $2,000 (hopefully i get it) and I am taking an HTML and CSS course on Scrimba and it has been such an exciting journey.
Here I am today, typing this and I am super excited to join this amazing community. I hope to learn from you one way or another.
Signing out,

You can run it without separate compilation:

I'm 54 so regardless, can't retire for another year but Devorah hit 55

Overall I've been pretty happy at Hunter but I've written before about
the fact that I've been feeling some burn out and have been basically
doing 2+ full time jobs myself at Hunter for the past few years and
that's just not sustainable.

Not saying I know what I'm going to do  but it's important to know
your options.

I wasn't sure what our retirement benefits would look like but when I
came in to teaching, looking at the older tier 1 teachers, I felt that
back then there was something of a societal pact, at least in NYC. As

This seems simple enough (if you know Electron buzz words), but there’s not a lot of great examples out there that explicitly show how to do this kind of stuff unless you dig. I had to go through the Electron Discord to find a secret gist that finally had a proper example that worked for me.

据微博爆料，砍人原因疑似因患儿消化不良，胃镜未发现问题，彭主任给孩子开CT检查发现腹盆肿物， 家长坚称肿瘤是CT做出来的，于是便持刀将医生砍伤。 
任何理由的暴力伤医行为都不可原谅！
何况是因为“肿瘤是CT做出来的”这种不可理喻，及其离谱失智理由。

这一切需要改变了，让我们一起呐喊，为医生创造更安全的行医环境！！

As someone who started learning React on his own more than 4 years ago and has been working as a React developer for the past 3 years, it’s a concern that I’m extremely familiar with. It’s a struggle that I had as well in the beginning. Although it worked out in the end, it definitely could’ve been a smoother process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making an administration dashboard for all my freelance clients is always a challenge.  It's just annoying to create a new database, add it to your site, enable authentication, etc.
It's understandable why a lot of people use Wordpress instead of raw code, mainly for the reason of the dashboard and how easy it is to edit things.
Guess what?  I just changed that for all you React and Next.js developers out there.  You won't have to use Wordpress over your favorite stack anymore or spend hours sweating your brain out coding an admin dashboard.  All it takes to implement this is a git clone, editing some JSON and ENV values, and your dashboard is ready to go!
Take a look at the demo and try it out!

由于两位室友工作变动准备搬走，现有两间次卧出租，两间的价格都是 3700 ，其中一间已经搬空，另一间最晚会到年后才搬，年后想换房的也来看看呗。
房子是 2000 年左右的电梯房 11 层，房东重新装修好后我们是第一批来入住的房客，电视、架子、微波炉、烤箱都是我自己买的，住起来绝对符合年轻人的需求（避免老公房内外老旧以及房东奇妙审美家具的困扰）。
不方便养宠物，希望您爱干净，不抽烟，作息规律（规律的熬夜不算不规律哈- -）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[amiwrong123: 
https://www.cnblogs.com/pointer-smq/p/5297682.html
这篇文章说 这条语句 label = 2 会让编译器隐式调用 Token 的构造函数用 2 构造一个 Token ，参数的_content 采用默认值“”，然后又调用隐式生成的移动赋值(move assignment)函数，进行赋值。
我就根据程序，再加一个移动构造函数，却发现报错了。
#include 
using namespace std;
struct Token
{
    int label;
    string content;
    Token(int _label = -1, string _content = "")
        : label(_label)
        , content(_content)
    {
        cout 
报错：无法引用 函数 "Token::operator=(const Token &)" (已隐式声明) -- 它是已删除的函数。这是为啥啊？
还有，文中说：当你写一个赋值语句的时候，编译器会首先检查两个类型又没有直接实现的赋值函数，然后检查赋值左右的类型是否能做隐式转换和构造，转换或者构造好之后，再尝试进行拷贝或移动赋值。这是顺序是对的吗？
比如 label = 2 这一步，
如果 operator=有定义，就直接执行 operator=这一步就行呗（即只有一个步骤）？
如果 operator=没有定义，那就得先执行 拷贝函数函数弄个临时变量，再调用移动构造函数（肯定有两个步骤）？
（比较菜，大佬们轻喷）]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[abc8678: 家里的 TCL 电视，实在是太难缠了。
(可以跳到最后一段了)
两年前就开始受到困扰，网上一直搜不到解决办法，只能屡战屡败。终于，在茫茫搜索结果中看到了一篇不错的教程 https://rocka.me/article/cursed-tcl-android-tv 。折腾了几个小时后，root 拿到了，apk 安装器也解禁了，系统更新我也停用了，满满的预装软件也清理掉了。最后还有个问题没能解决，就是防止系统桌面自动更新。
虽然教程里换了桌面启动器，可我一换，家人可能就不会用了。因为官方启动器可以记住上次的信号源，而且我换上第三方桌面后(不是用教程的方法。之前用官改系统，默认是当贝今天换回官方才开始按教程走)，信号源奇迹般的废了，选哪个都没反应了。正常情况下，选了信号源的某个选项，对话框就自动消失，官方桌面启动器开始放画面，官改就没办法看机顶盒了。只好保留启动器。
可是启动器一旦联网，就会自动更新得花里胡哨，主页的缩略图在艰难地加载视频，遥控器上下左右选择的时候，按下去没反应，过几秒才勉强卡卡地支撑起来切换选项，然后选中的缩略图就换个视频加载播放，又卡几秒钟……
结果检查，桌面启动器被静默更新了。只要卸载更新，回到出厂版本就不卡了。可不久后，它还是会自动更新。我现在暂时用 OpenWrt 把网络拦住了。问一下，有没有办法让这个应用程序保持在出厂版本，禁止更新？]]></summary>

** 主要需求就是备份照片和资料，然后就是需要支持开发工作和 Docker
大佬们帮我看下我的部署方案行不行
方案一
M2 安装 PVE
PVE 安装 openwrt 作为软路由
PVE 安装 Ubuntu 日常玩和测试
PVE 安装 DSM 存储照片，两块 2T 直通组 raid1 ，备份我的白裙 DSM7 （后续考虑卖掉）
方案二
类似方案一，把 DSM 替换为 trueNAS 作为存储
方案三
再买个 U 盘安装 unraid
后续怎么搞还没有规划好
疑问点
PVE 对比 unraid ，哪个对虚拟化以及直通硬件和 Docker 支持好一点
trueNAS 如何支持媒体和照片备份
有朋友强烈案例 unraid ，有什么比较好的方案]]></summary>

Linux 主机，使用 KVM/Qemu/Libvirt 运行虚拟机。
为了减少对主机 CPU 的占用及其他一些原因，虚拟机的网卡不使用 QEMU 的虚拟网卡（例如 e1000e 、virtio ），而是使用物理网卡开启 SR-IOV 之后的 VF （ virtual function ） 。主机的网卡为 PF （ physical function ），每个虚拟机分配一个 VF 网卡（ virtual function ） 。然后主机与虚拟机、虚拟机与虚拟机之间使用 PF 、VF 直接进行连接。
目前使用一个闲置的 PCIe 四口千兆网卡（ I350-T4 ）作为测试，不连接任何网线，不需要接入其他物理设备，仅仅作为主机虚拟机之间互联使用。如果测试成功，最终目标是购买一张支持 SR-IOV 的 PCIe 接口的万兆（甚至 40G ）网卡，作为虚拟机之间高速互联使用。
测试发现一个严重问题，网口必须插入网线，主机中的 PF 网卡、虚拟机中的 VF 网卡才为连同状态，此时主机与虚拟机之间、虚拟机与虚拟机之间可以相互连通。一旦拔出网线，网卡就为断开状态，无法相互通信。
如何在不插网线的情况下使用？]]></summary>

  I am sharing the path and tips i followed to get to the level i am today on.



  
  
  Practice the Basics as much as you can -



The base of the web development is HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
Try to practice these things as much as you can at the core levels Because the advance topics are related or combination of core topics and can only be understood if you are familiar with the basics. 
For the HTML part - try to practice the important tags as much as you can like p , h1-h6 , ol  and ul , div, etc and also semantic tags like main ,…]]></summary>

...I don't think anyone says "happy new week" but whatever.
Today, I planned out my Weekly Sprint Goals. I intend to finish the Services pages for my company website, then deploy them after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them. I also intend to continue learning Next.js, Scrum, and SWR. Lastly, I would like to learn new technologies, and I'm thinking of MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter, but I will most likely do it if I have the extra time.
Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!
Just like I do every weekend, I did my 11th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.
I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on learning Next.js, Scrum, and SWR, updating my website, and maybe picking up another technology when I have the extra time.
finish building the Services pages for my company website

deploy the updates after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them.
continue learning by reading the Next.js documentation.
continue going through Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
learn SWR and go through the documentation.
continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.
If I have the extra time, I'm going to learn either MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter.
Thank you for reading! Have a good day!

The best way to learn is to do. So this tutorial will be light on theory and heavy on practical exercises. 
So we'll need a real graphql server to play with. Let's use Vendure, an open-source GraphQL e-commerce framework. I chose Vendure because it is really easy to set up - all you need is to make sure you have Node.js installed. Plus I built it so I know the API quite well 😉
To install a local instance of Vendure, run:
npx @vendure/create my-shop

and follow the prompts. Select SQLite and use the defaults for all other prompts. Installation should take about 5 minutes and then you'll have a f…]]></summary>

Notifying me of the badge, DEV wants to encourage me to continue the streak and receive another badge for posting something (anything, actually) every week for another eight weeks. I could even write a bot who does that, and then I'll write another post featuring a codepen of my bot script.
After a thoughtful second, I decided to put the badge on my not-to-do-list.
While building habits can help people to achieve their goals, I think that rewarding quantity is a step in the wrong direction (unless it's about brushing your teeth every day).

Nevertheless, we’ve already set out that journey about a year ago:
we show an overlay popup to all IE users, asking them to switch:


throughout last year, we upgraded to Tailwind 2 and Stimulus 3 even though both frameworks drop official support for IE,
we still use a few IE-related polyfills that solve the biggest issues, but only for the most critical use cases,
and we generally don’t test newly built features in IE any more.

NepTunes：Mac 上的音乐播放小工具

平台：macOS
关键词：音乐

此前我一直是 Spotify 的忠实拥趸，充足的曲库以及成熟的音乐算法，完全击中我的痛点。但音乐流媒体可是个竞争极其激烈的领域，QQ 音乐有霸主地位的华语曲库优势，Apple Music 在去年连续推出了无损音乐和空间音频资源，Tidal 在保持音质优势的同时也不断扩充曲库，相比之下 Spotify 似乎是不进则退退退退。

可几年的使用习惯摆在那里，放弃 Spotify 不太容易，但 Apple Music 囤了大半年的免费体验不用又很可惜，成年人嘛，做什么选择，当然是两个都启用啦。不过双持的问题也很明显，二者有着不同的应用布局，曲库标记也完全独立，很难做到「二位一体」。如果你恰好在使用二者的音乐服务，又是 macOS 用户，那今天推荐的 NepTunes 或许可以帮你减少一些麻烦。

国外一位负责计算机学科的教师认证的负责人说，“计算机学科的教师确实需要 了解计算机。”而现在开箱即用的脚本化内容和短期培训培养出来的计算机教师并不了解他们的学科、他们的学生以及如何进行教学。很多教师在短期集中培训计算机学科后就可以教它。这种方法可能会让这些学生通过标准化考试，但从长远来看，这并没有给学生带来他们需要的东西，也没有给他们应得的东西。


老王点评：这真是形式化的学习和考试。不知道国内的计算机教育情况如何。




Faker.js 自毁后，开源社区复刻接管了它

Faker 是一个生成虚假但合理数据的库，可用于测试和开发，最早由 Perl 语言开发，之后移植到包括 JavaScript 在内的各种语言。在 Facker.js 项目被原开发者 自毁 之后，对大量依赖该库的程序造成了破坏，因此，社区在原项目上 复刻，重新建立了围绕它的 社区，由八位社区成员接管维护。开发者在复刻后，进行了 大量的工作，包括处理了许多拉取请求和议题，并提出一系列富有建设性的路线图。此外，用户多次强烈要求将原作者从赞助名单中移除，因此，社区决定将 Open Collective 原来收到的一万多美元的赞助留给两位原作者，而新的赞助将归属新的社区团队。


老王点评：以开源方式做出贡献不是泄愤的理由，还好开源给了更多可能。




服务数百万域名的邮件服务商出现问题后

Mail2World 是一个服务了 215 万个域名的邮件服务商，已经运营了几十年。最近他们似乎遭受到勒索软件攻击，因而许多依赖于他们的邮箱服务的用户陷入了 麻烦。而服务商还“正在努力尽快全面恢复电子邮件服务”中。一位用户反馈称，“它与我所有的账户联系在一起，不仅包括社交媒体和物联网设备，还包括银行业务、获得医疗服务以及与当地和全国政府当局的联系。”


老王点评：当越来越集中的基础服务没有提供相应的更高可靠性时，其带来的影响是灾难性的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近，支付宝和微信纷纷祭出了「大动作」：前有支付宝的一键标记已读，后有微信的「史诗级」新功能从暂停处继续播放语音——看起来好像是「人性化」的细节更新。作为每天都在使用支付宝和微信的用户，我们真正需要的功能，仅仅只是那么简单吗？
除了语音播放，微信的问题还不少
相信不少人都有在微信收获「60s 语音炸弹」的头疼时刻。在我看来，微信语音消息目前的问题主要是以下几点：

用户无法控制语音消息的播放进度，如果语音消息的播放中断，我们不得不从头来过（在微信 8.0.17 中得到部分解决）；
用户无法在语音录制时查看屏幕上的其他内容，只能看到倒计时读秒，大块的屏幕空间被浪费；
语音消息无法转发，或以最近消息的形式同步到登录的其他设备上。

我之所以反感语音消息，主要是因为用户不能自由控制语音播放。如果中断了语音消息的播放，就不得不从头来过。但是，微信本次更新仅提供了一个「继续播放」的按钮，并没有真正解决痛点。在语音消息的播放中，常常有些听不清楚，或者是难以一次理解的片段出现，「继续播放」的功能并没有解决这一需求。

这也正是为什么，许多用户希望微信能够加上语音控制条来调节播放进度——最好还能加上播放速度、音量的整体设置。只有这样，上文提到的第一个问题才能得以解决。
相比之下，iMessage 的语音消息功能，就比微信更加实用。
首先，语音录制的过程中，我们无需一直按住屏幕，只要按住并向左滑动按钮，就可以查看 iMessage 对话中的其他消息，方便我们对某些消息进行回应。其次，由于语音本质上是通过音频文件来发送的，因此除了简单的「暂停」功能外，iMessage 还有具体的进度条，方便用户调节播放的起始位置。

最后，语音消息可以转发，也可以通过 iCloud 在设备间无缝同步。以上三点正好对应了之前所提到的微信语音的几个问题，在我看来是比较完善的语音消息的解决方案之一。
当然了，微信的…]]></summary>

如题，一个 C#的 dll 项目（之前是.net framework 4.8 ）中，通过 fody 打包引用的库。VS 为 2022 版，Fody 为 nuget 上的最新版。
False，编译时就不会复制此文件，最后 Fody 生成的 dll 文件中也不会包含此引用的打包文件  

    ..\Lib\Example.exe
    False


在将项目更改为.net standard 2.0 后（经测试，2.1 ，以及.net 5.0\6.0 均有同样问题），引用的右下角属性内的“复制本地”选项变为了影响 CopyLocal 项，例如我此时将这个文件改为“复制本地”，那么 csproj 中将会变成这样

    ..\Lib\Example.exe
    False
    True


问题来了，这样的配置下，在生成时并不会复制 Example.exe ，fody 也不会打包此文件。
为 True ，那么编译时将会正常复制并打包。  
简单来说就是，VS 在编译时候似乎完全无视了，而只认。
查看微软的官方文档，VS2022 的 MSBuild 说明中只有 Private 元数据而没有 CopyLocal 。根据说明，Private 属性指示“指定是否应将引用复制到输出文件夹。 此特性与 Visual Studio IDE 中的引用的“复制本地”属性相匹配。”

，根据生成时的表现来看，确实也只有设置的值有实际效果。
但是即使直接新建空白项目，引用文件并设置“复制本地”后，VS 修改的也只有 csproj 中的项而不是项。
的值。只能手动编辑 csproj 文件。
所以我现在非常迷糊，到底这个和是什么关系呢？我之前以为是升级换代的关系，但是即使我删掉了旧项目中的只保留，在编译项目时，文件复制依然会按照 Private 的默认值(true)执行文件复制与 Fody 打包，而完全无视了的值。彻底把我给整不会了

        <id>http://www.zhihu.com/question/511439434/answer/2314014565</id>

        <updated>2022-01-17T08:08:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：
1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。
”盐者，百肴之将“[1]，意思就是盐为"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。
同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。

比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。
比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。
比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。


另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。
2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性
人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。
可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。
糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。
3. 盐的可获得性高于糖
盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。
大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。
而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。

综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。
如果你感兴趣其他关于味觉感官和厨房原理的回答，这里还有一些我回答过其他有意思的问题：
为什么捏住鼻子就不会尝到味道？
你是明白了哪几个基本原理之后而厨艺大增的？

http://wejectchan.gitee.io/git-emoji-user-guide/
某天和朋友聚餐，途中谈到在 git 提交信息使用 emoji 的话题，引起了大家浓厚兴趣。
在我接触的项目中，git 提交规则大多按约定执行，这些约定往往写在了开发手册中（大多数和版本升级规则一并约定），但几乎没有对 emoji 的使用进行约定。
于是，回家后开始研究，原来 github 上还真有一个项目，提倡在 git 提交中使用 emoji 。
这样带来的好处是:
1. 非常清晰明表达本次提交的主要内容；
2. 在众多的提交列表中，特征比较明显，容易查找历史某次提交信息；
3. 较为美观

目前比较主流的使用方式为:
git commit -m ':emoji_code: any commit messages(iusse)'

于是做个上面那个网站，感觉还不错~~大家可以试试]]></summary>

If you've ever been on a support call, you've probably spent several minutes spelling out even the shortest commands and explaining in detail where the spaces and returns fall. While it's often easier to just seize control of a user's computer, that's not really the best way to educate. What you might try instead is sending a user a screen recording, but one that they can copy commands from and paste into their own terminal.

一个自己写东西玩儿的机子被 hack 了，搭的 mongodb ，为了远程测试开了端口，然后粗心忘了设置密码，然后就被拖库了，如图：

里面那个 READ_ME_TO_RECOVER_YOUR_DATA 就是黑客留下的，爬了几天的数据全没了，可恶。
不过幸好只是写着玩儿的东西。这几天还在用，把端口关了，开了鉴权，设置了密码。然而上面那个数据库还在，怎么感觉数据好像依然在丢失，难道是里面设置了什么自动化程序吗？我是不是应该早点把它删掉。
试了下执行 db.dropDatabase()，那个被置入的库还是一直都显示。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「城市风光」是一个很广义的词，大部分时候它不仅指代某一个地点，更是我们经历过、熟悉的并留下深刻回忆的地方。它的妙不可言或许人尽皆知一目了然，亦或许是深藏心底只有自己知道的秘密。
回忆汹涌呼之欲出，且听作者们平和、真诚且娓娓道来。我们希望通过「城市漫步指南」这个系列，带你领略每一个有趣而又非凡的城市风光。

自从上大学离开家乡之后，这么多年来也算是兜兜转转路过了、生活了好多城市。我的一个非常普遍的观察就是，北方城市相对于南方城市会更加有一种棱角感、粗旷感，路会宽些，建筑会方正些，线条会简洁些。后来去了欧洲，这样的感受无疑被愈发的放大了，就拿德国东北部的城市来说，就和南德诸城有着「判若两国」的区别，只是走在街道上就能强烈的感受得到。
北京，作为一个北方的超级城市，给我的观感更是如此。路很宽，宽到可能要小跑着才能赶在绿灯变红前通过一个十字路口；建筑很粗旷，别提小阳台了，甚至连飘窗都恨不能凹进整栋建筑里以维持整栋建筑的方正。这么看来，北京的城市画像像极了一个「国字脸大叔」，平时不苟言笑，永远板正，永远严肃。
可是即便在这样的一座大城里，也有一些小街小巷的浪漫，那就是被钢铁丛林包围着的北京的老城。老城里，有着外乡人一般很难触及的一些市井生活，比如胡同生活；也有老北京也鲜少触及（或不屑触及）的生活，比如常年游人如织的故宫等皇城遗址。
作为一个在北京生活的外乡人（至少我自己这么认为），在北京生活了近四年的时间，唯一不会拒绝的一个邀约，就是去逛胡同，逛春夏秋冬的胡同。
北京胡同一景
如果你对城市的历史感兴趣的话
胡同让我着迷的一个原因就是他的名字流传下来都是有一定的历史原因的，这能够让你置身在其中的时候能够感受历史长河的流动。
禄米仓胡同
禄米仓胡同位于北京东城区的东南部，顾名思义，是明清两朝存储官俸米的地方。如果现在去这条胡同的话，你会发现已经被军需装备研究所占用了。这虽然是当下的状态，…]]></summary>

PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛
前言
回想小时候，一到冬天就开始期盼着学校快点放寒假，期盼着快点过年。因为过年有放不完的鞭炮与吃不完的糖果，犹记得那时候我的口袋里总是充满着各式各样的糖果。今天就以糖果为主题，实现糖果雨来啦这个互动小游戏。
效果展示
开始引导页面
糖果收集页面
收集结束页面










实现细节
具体实现其实也很简单，主要分为3块内容：
开始引导页面：提供开始按钮来告诉用户如何开始，3秒倒计时动画，让用户做好准备。
糖果收集页面：自动生成糖果并从上往下掉落，用户点击糖果完成收集（糖果消失 & 糖果收集总数加一）。
收集结束页面：告诉用户一共收集了多少糖果，提供再玩一次按钮入口。
引导动画
如果单单是一个静态页面，提供文字来提醒用户如何开始游戏，会略显单调，所以我加了一些自定义View动画，模拟点击动作，来达到提醒用户作用。
利用三个动画组合在一起同时执行，从达到该效果，分别是：
手指移动去点击动画。
点击后的水波纹动画。
点击后糖果+1动画。
这里我们以 点击后糖果+1动画 举例。
我们先建一个res/anim/candy_add_anim.xml文件，如下：



    

    

然后在指定的View中执行该动画，如下：
binding.candyAddOneTv.apply {
    val animation = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(context, R.anim.candy_add_anim)
    startAnimation(animation)
}

糖果的生成
从效果展示图中也可以看出，糖果的样式是各式各样的且其位置坐标是随机的。
我通过代码动态生成一个大小固定…]]></summary>

徒步难度：★★★★
风景指数：★★★★★
最佳季节：4-6月/9-11月




梅里雪山的主峰卡瓦格博海拔6740米，是云南的最高点，也是最被尊崇的藏传佛教神山之一，又被藏人称作“太子雪山”，至今梅里雪山所有重要山峰均没有登顶成功的记录。



人人都以能看一眼梅里巍峨的雄姿为荣，而只有日出时云雾消散，才能看到毫无遮挡的“日照金山”，这难以得见的奇景是许多人数次前来的理由。想要亲近雪山，可以徒步 进入雨崩…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[每逢年末，各方媒体与出版商都会公布年度书单，向公众推荐他们评选出来的各种好书。对于每一个喜欢阅读的人来讲，这个书单是不可错过的。对于普通人来讲，这些书单也是一年的风向标，可以一窥大众阅读走向，最末可以充当茶余饭后的谈资。
在阅读各家书单的时候，你会发现这样一个事情：英雄往往所见略同，一些优秀的书籍就会出现在多家的年度书单当中。当然这也不是说其他的图书不够好，有些稍显小众题材的图书也同样值得我们关注。
遍览各家书单的时候，我更喜欢的是历史向的图书。在我看来，这些历史类的书相对于虚构的文学作品来讲，他们更多了一份真实、一份厚重。
2021 年是辛亥革命 110 周年。「筚路蓝缕，以启山林。」无数先贤用努力奋斗换来我们今日的成就。在这个时候，回顾一下与我们自身相关的图书无疑有着特别的意义。所以我在这些推荐的书单当中选择了与我们脚下这片土地相关的历史书籍。通过它们来了解这片土地曾经发生过的事情，那些对今天依然产生重大影响力的事件。
书单的整体情况
与往年相比，2021 年看起来似乎并没有太大的不同。但 2021 年也有其自身的印记。对于「中国史」学界来讲，2021 年我们痛失了两位史学大家，一位是我国著名的史学家与教育家章开沅先生，另一位是美国著名的汉学家史景迁。 二者相关著述可以通过豆瓣上的链接 章开沅、史景迁 了解更多。「大家」的去世无疑给相关的研究带来了不可估量的损失。
章开沅(照片来自 新华网湖北频道 )与史景迁(照片来自 美国国家人文学术基金会)
而对于书单本身来讲，2021 年同样有一个值得悲伤的事情，那就是中国亚马逊（以下简称中亚）没有如期发布年度书单。作为以往普通读者比较关注的书单之一，中亚的书单一度是读者买书的风向标。随着中亚业务方向的调整，中亚已经在事实上退出了纸质图书的经销并收缩为一个海外购的服务商。而最近的关于 Kindle 退出的消息不绝于耳，这也不禁让人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些天来，各种各样的人都在创建视频内容。从专业的 YouTubers 到学校教师，创建视频内容已经成为各种工作内容的一部分。

从屏幕记录器到视频编辑器，有各种工具可以帮助创建良好的视频。提词器也是这样的工具之一。

提词器可以提供视觉提示，甚至是完整的文本，这样演讲者就可以在讲话时接受提示。你可能已经看到新闻读者使用提词器。

有专门的提词器软件，可以在电脑或移动设备上运行。

QPrompt 就是这样一款软件，它可以在 Linux、Windows 和其他平台上免费使用。

QPrompt：个人提词器软件



QPrompt 是一个提词器软件，适用于所有类型的视频创作者。它的主要重点是易用性和快速性能。

QPrompt 可与 Web 摄像头和手机、演播室提词器和平板提词器一起使用。它的独特能力是使其背景透明，这使得它在视频会议上表现出色。

以下是 QPrompt 的亮点功能：


可与演播室提词器、平板提词器、网络摄像头和电话一起使用

流畅移动，无抖动

可以在提示的同时进行即时修改

从其他软件中粘贴，不费力气

为你估算剩余时间

使用标记来跳到脚本的任何地方

向多个屏幕提示，有独立的镜像功能

背景透明，让你在讲话时可以看到你自己或你的听众

内置的计时器

进度指示器

丰富的文本格式

支持超过 180 种语言的书写系统


QPrompt 中的 “Q” 提示该应用是使用 Qt 框架制作的。它的用户界面使用 Kirigami 框架。所有这些都使它成为 KDE 上的一个很好的选择，但在 GNOME 中也是如此。

安装 QPrompt



QPrompt 是一个自由开源软件，它可以用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。也有适用于安卓设备的 APK，但目前还不稳定。

Linux 用户可以选择 AppImage、Snap 和 Deb文件。在写这篇文章的时候，Flatpak 包正在开发中。

你可以从该项目网站的下载区获得 AppImage。


下载 AppImage 格式的 QPrompt


其他安装选项可在其 GitHub 仓库的发布页面上找到：


其他下载选项


总结

我想对这个应用的功能进行评论，但由于我从未使用过提词器，我想我无法测试和“判断”其所有功能。如果你过去使用过这类软件，可以试试 QPrompt，看看它与其他同类软件的竞争情况。

近年来，随着「双向链接」和「Zettelkasten」概念的兴起，和人们对更有效地记录笔记的需求的高涨，笔记软件的市场呈现出推陈出新和自我革新的局面。不仅有 Roam Research 和 Obsidian 等后起之秀凭借对这两种笔记法的率先支持获得广泛欢迎，一些传统笔记软件，例如 Notion，也在逐步加入相应的功能支持。
在这些丰富的笔记软件选择之外，还有另一个值得关注的软件，也通过特殊的方式实现了这些功能需求，那就是微软出品的文本编辑器 VS Code。VS Code 最为强大之处，在于可以通过丰富的扩展，将其定制成为自己专属且特化的应用（少数派中介绍将 VS Code 用作笔记软件的文章）。这篇文章要介绍的，便是在 VS Code 上实现「双向链接」和「Zettelkasten」功能的扩展：Foam。
少数派上目前有相当数量介绍「双向链接」和「Zettelkasten」概念的文章，且内容详尽、质量优秀。因此本文将聚焦于对 Foam 这一工具的介绍和自己的使用经验（也因为笔者实践 Zettelkasten 的时间较短，无法妄谈理解）。
在 官方主页 上，Foam 被定义为「受 Roam Research 启发的、依托于 VS Code 和 GitHub 的、管理和分享个人知识的系统」。你可以用它来组织研究、记录笔记或者在网络上发布内容。这篇文章中我们将主要把 Foam 作为构建笔记系统的工具。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[没有人会选择售价三、四十一晚的廉价旅馆。
如果不是穷游学生、迫于生计的求职者，走投无路的过路人，几乎鲜有人在这停留。破旧，肮脏，危险，狭小似乎是他们的代言词，敬而远之。
蜿蜒曲折，爬楼后的别样风景
个高的人想要上这样一个台阶非低头不可
一般来说，每一家小旅馆都有一条黑暗曲折只能允许一个人通行的小道，越往上，越黑暗。
廉价旅馆似乎都藏于这样的深巷之中
当你提着行李箱只身费九牛二虎之力走上这三折台阶，等待你的是个用玻璃围起来的小窗。只需朝着小窗吼上三四遍，老板自会从你未曾发觉的地方突然现身。
进一个巷口并不算困难，困难的是爬上这狭窄曲折的楼梯
大多数的时候，小旅馆的老板都在你看不见的窗口后面睡觉。有人唤的时候才会从搭建在小窗下的简易弹簧床上忽然坐起，然后一脸睡意的询问你单间还标间。
小旅馆的老板一般都藏在小玻璃窗口的后面
除了传统的身份人脸验证核对，老板会从抽屉里再掏出一本破旧小本，记下你的入住时间，预定平台和缴纳押金数额。一般来说，这种小旅馆的押金都比较少，几十块钱给个意思就行，全凭老板心情。
一台摆在大厅里的电脑就是个接待台了
办理好了一切，给到你的房卡也不过是一串绑着号码牌的钥匙串。好一点的小旅馆会有一个钥匙牌，直接插入门把手下端，进门之后还可以靠这个钥匙牌供电。
推门而进便是床铺，尽管空间狭小，但已是豪华高配
一般小旅馆的格局都不会很大，单人间也就是个睡觉的地儿。厕所和洗澡的地方一般不太会有单独的。晚上想洗个澡，内急想蹲个坑，只能出门右拐，走下一层楼到楼道尽头的洗漱池那，和所有住在这的人一起洗漱，一起蹲坑。
单人间一般没有独卫、电视，一张床便是全部
大多数人住这种旅馆都会担心卫生问题。旅馆里的公用厕所和洗漱间大多陈旧泛黄，尽管蹲坑的时候你得小心翼翼避开所有在地上的不堪。
蹲下来的时候面对的是一堆无痛人流医院广告，但基本的日常使用总是没什么问题的。不禁心里暗戳戳想到，“三十块钱，又要什么自行车呢？”
行走江湖，入住后的旅馆冷暖。
开在大学城附近的小旅馆倒是设备齐全
尽管是三十块的小旅馆，该有的倒是一个不差。电视，空调，WiFi，有的甚至还配上了麻将桌。只不过想要使用空调，多半得再交个十块钱，才能从老板那拿到遥控。
贴满墙纸似乎也能感受到老板的用心布置
电视别指望太好的显示效果，能响个声就算万幸，大多数甚至都没办法搜到频道。狭小的空间，想要在床上伸个懒腰甚至都是一件奢侈的事情。
在这种小旅馆里，不一定所有的床单都是白色
在这三十块一晚上的小旅馆，床单到底有没有一晚一换，估计也只有老板知道了。只要不是肉眼可见的肮脏，基本也就不太会每天更换了。
有的老板大概也担心你觉得旅馆太过于冷清，所以墙上倒也总能看到一些“温馨”画面。
墙壁上贴满荷花似乎白墙也就没有那么冰冷了
老板倒也直言不讳，“被套这东西哪有那个劲送专门的公司去洗，我们都是自己手洗。你以为送过去洗的有多干净？他到底给你洗了没他敢给你保证么，但我就敢保证我100%给你洗了。” 
格外温馨好看的床单，让人感觉像在家一样
大门和晾台布满了刚刚换下来的床单枕被套，在几条拉起来的废旧电线上还挂着刚刚入住在此的旅客换洗下来的衣物。
在门口晾晒的床单被套
南昌的夏天热的可怕，在天台暴晒一会儿倒是干起来很快。住在这儿的旅客也大多是来昌打工的讨生活者。在这暂住几天，找着工作就去工地上班，能省一点就是一点。
迫于生计，躺下后的片刻舒缓
粉色调的布置又是否觉得温馨
大多数的时候，想找一个安静且舒适的小旅馆并不是一件幸运的事儿。学生时代的我要想出去看看，住和交通，永远是最大的开销。廉价旅馆便是唯一的选择了。
尽管床铺就正对厕所，但有个独卫的单间已经很好了
用钥匙打开木门的第一眼就被惊讶了，与其说这是一间房，倒不如直接说是楼梯下的一个小空间。
隔音什么的也就基本不存在了。隔板那边的住客玩了一晚上消消乐，我竟然也难以置信的听了一晚上的Unbelievable。
房间与房间挨的这么近，发出点什么声响对门一准知道
彻夜难眠是在小旅馆常会发生的事儿，毕竟除了隔音糟糕会让你难以入睡，还有你搞不明白到底是什么的东西留下的床单印记让你整夜直犯恶心。

住进廉价小旅馆的人，多半是因为经济紧张才不得已选择。

拎着行李箱爬上那个幽暗狭窄的小楼梯时就注定今晚没法睡的安稳。可是，在没钱没工作的焦躁绝望中，又有多少睡在这的人会真的安稳入睡呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[春节「炸场子」那肯定非大红色系莫属了
不过大红色也分不同的色温色调，我来推荐几个我自己很喜欢的大红色系口红，唇膏唇釉，哑光亮面都有，应该会有你喜欢/适合你的一款
（为了好看唇周有磨皮美白，但是嘴唇本嘴是没有磨皮没有调色的，手上的试色是啥都没调过的原图，仅供参考）
阿玛尼红管唇釉 #405

最出圈的烂番茄色，老网红了，但是真的很漂亮，我用过不少烂番茄色，用来用去还是405最好看，每年秋冬都会拿出来用

厚涂非常浓郁，非常显白，整个脸都亮了的感觉，跟毛衣大衣绝配，不成膜会沾杯，但是不用担心掉色，因为掉色之后底色也还在，基本就是薄涂的效果，而405薄涂也很好看！


NARS黑管唇釉 Light my fire

也是橘调的红色，但是比阿玛尼405更亮，差不多是非荧光的橘红色里最亮的一个，非常抓人眼球，用来「炸场子」非常合适哈哈哈

处于染唇液和唇釉之间的那种质地，很轻薄但是遮盖力显色度绝了，干的快会成膜，在嘴上扒的很牢，吃饭啥的不会掉，注意卸妆的时候用眼唇卸妆液多敷会儿

资生堂 银座细管口红 #220

又是一个偏橘的红，不过这个是粉橘调，很像是大红灯笼点亮之后的那种红色，膏体带一点点金闪，但是上嘴之后看不出有闪片，有很自然的光泽感

薄涂粉调比较明显，很嫩，挺日常的，厚涂橘调就明显了，虽然是唇膏但是涂的时候很丝滑，很润不拔干，不过持久度也一般


YSL金圆管唇膏 #83

终于到蓝调的红了，不过黄皮也没问题，不是玫红那种，很妙的一个颜色，薄涂是水红，厚涂棕调就出来了，比草莓红更知性，比砖红更活泼

是改版之后的新质地，不假润了，膏体也带细闪，上最看不出来，但是光泽感很漂亮，显得嘴很饱满

MAC 子弹头 Cockney

标准的草莓红，膏体带金闪，上嘴也能看到一点点闪，青春活泼，跟YSL 83相比更适合年轻的妹子，玫调更明显一点，不太适合黄黑皮


丝芙兰 哑光唇釉 #01

虽然叫樱桃红，但是我觉得这个是一个非常非常正的大红色，不偏橘也不偏玫，哑光丝绒感很漂亮，干了之后不沾杯，持久度也很不错
如果你不知道自己适合哪种大红，就选这个正红，厚涂不会出错的

下面是我能找到的链接，incase我写的商品名称不够准确，或者你们种草了想买

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[提前了解一下 Pop!_OS 即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境。仅供参考。




如果你还不知道，System76 的开发者一直在 致力于开发一个新的桌面环境（被称为 COSMIC），它是用 Rust 编写的，Rust 是一种内存安全的超快编程语言。

从头开始创建一个桌面环境不是一件小事。这涉及到创建从合成器、面板、窗口管理器到桌面环境的 API 和其他后端任务的一切。

这不是一件容易的事，而维护它又是另一回事。

而且，看起来 System76 已经开始了这方面的工作。

在 GitHub 上，你会发现已经有一个名为 cosmic 的仓库，但它主要是使用 JavaScript（用于创建 GNOME shell 扩展的语言）编写的。这就是 cosmic shell 扩展仓库，也就是 Pop!_OS 现在所搭载的。

在他们的 GitHub 中还有几个较新的仓库，这些恰好是他们即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面的元素。

所以，现在是时候构建、测试并提前了解一下了。


注： 澄清一下，目前 Pop!_OS 上基于 GNOME 的桌面环境叫做 COSMIC。而本文讨论的是基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，它是从头开始构建的，旨在取代当前的产品。


基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验

打算成为 COSMIC 桌面环境整体一部分的三个仓库是：


设置应用

顶部面板（目前用于 X11 系统）

合成器（似乎支持原生的 wayland、xwayland 和 X11 系统）


COSMIC 设置应用




注意： 这是一个半生不熟的早期预览，以让你有个大致印象。随着开发的继续，用户界面可能会有根本性的变化。所以，仅用于参考。


这是 Pop!_OS 的新 COSMIC 桌面的设置应用。它目前还在开发当中，没有准备好使用，不过如果你想运行它并试试界面，请随意！

那么，它看起来与目前的 COSMIC 体验有什么不同呢？



在写这篇文章时，该用户界面似乎没有与任何后端 API 相连接。启用和禁用 “为工作区启用左上角热角 ”的切换并没有什么变化，其他的切换也是如此，除了设置应用的 “关于” 部分所显示的信息。

仔细看截图，放置的位置很凌乱，但作为早期预览（或原型）来说也是正常的。

看起来他们正在用圆角和更干净的外观来处理一切。

切换动画感觉快速、流畅和迅捷（即使是在虚拟机内，我等不及在裸机上尝试）。但考虑到它甚至还没有功能，谈论性能没什么意义。



就个人而言，我不喜欢他们所采用的圆角外观。在我看来，GNOME 对圆角的实现是完美的。但是，看看它的结果应该是很有趣的。

顶部面板

作为 COSMIC 桌面环境的一部分，顶部面板也正在使用 Rust 语言实现。

至于这个顶部面板的外观，我不太确定如何测试它才不算对它不公平。从 GNOME 中启动它，会在 GNOME 的顶栏后面打开它。所以我想在一个单独的窗口管理器中打开它（到目前为止只用 bspwm 和 i3-wm 试过），但这导致了一些古怪的行为，比如面板像普通 GUI 软件一样占据了全部垂直空间。

COSMIC 合成器

COSMIC 桌面环境的合成器编译成功了，但在与 bspwm 或 i3-wm 一起使用时却无法启动。我试着在窗口管理器中启动它，因为 GNOME 不允许改变合成器。

这是由于在使用 VirtualBox 的虚拟机中，视频驱动的混乱以及 COSMIC 合成器还没有准备好。

但是，还有更多！

开发者 Eduardo Flores 也尝试了新的 COSMIC 桌面，在他的 博客文章 中分享了一些应用启动器和坞站的截图。



应用程序启动器看起来很相似，但是使用 GTK 构建的。同样，你也可以期待 Pop!_OS 21.10 引入一个类似的应用程序库，以及经典的坞站。



总结

当然，现在说发展的方向还为时过早。

要期待一个成熟的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验的测试版，应该还需要一段时间。

但是，从我们在这里看到的情况来看，我很兴奋。

你怎么看？欢迎你在下面的评论中分享你的想法！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面
距离上一篇文章跟我一起开发商业级IM（3）—— 长连接稳定性之连接及重连发布的时间，大概已有一年多，先跟大家说声抱歉。主要是因为工作太忙，业务需求过多，没办法专心写博客。先立个Flag：IM系列文章一定会坚持写完，同时Github项目也会逐步完善，敬请期待。
Shine，同时也希望自己借此机会重新拾起写博客和开源项目的激情，废话少说，我们直接开始吧。
Shine是什么？
基于Retrofit二次封装的网络请求库。通过统一封装、高内聚、低耦合、灵活配置、高度扩展等特性使Android网络请求更简单。
版本

Java
Retrofit+RxJava
Kotlin
Retrofit+Coroutine
Shine能做什么？
支持的请求

GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
支持动态BaseUrl
支持自定义Response Model（不同数据结构）
支持自定义Response Parser（响应数据解析器）
支持自定义Cipher（请求/响应数据加解密）
支持自定义Content Type
支持异步/同步请求
统一的IApiService，新增接口时无需改动IApiService
统一的异常处理，方便在接口请求失败时获取相关错误信息
为什么这样做？
不统一的Response Model
日常开发中，大家应该会经常遇到Response Model不统一的情况，例如服务端A返回的数据格式为：code、msg、data，服务端B返回的数据格式为：errCode、errMsg、result，服务端C返回的数据格式为status、message、data等，甚至即使是同一个服务端提供的接口，也可能存在不同接口返回不同数据格式，客户端兼容起来异常困难。在Shine中，通过自定义Response Model及Response Parser即可轻松解决此问题，同时支持配置全局R…]]></summary>

To set the scene, we were a small and scrappy team of 6 having recently raised a seed round of a few million dollars. And we just needed to execute.
The fast pace was no joke. In the first week, we spent about 12h a day at the office for onboarding, that then decreased to ~10.5h a day. The founders spent even mor…]]></summary>

Netflix 再次提高订阅价格

1 月 14 日，视频流播服务 Netflix 宣布将提高其在美国和加拿大的月费价格。在美国，标准订阅的价格将会从原来的 13.99 美元提高到 15.49 美元，而可观看更高画质、同时播放设备数更多的高级订阅则提价 2 美元，达到 19.99 美元。新价格将对新会员立刻生效，并逐步对现有会员经提前 30 天通知后生效。
这次的价格上涨也是 Netflix 自 2020 年 10 月以来的再次调整定价。Netflix 的发言人表示，此次价格上涨主要用来支撑高质量的原创剧集成本。竞争对手方面，目前 HBO Max 正在对其订阅服务进行促销，价格为 11.99美元，而迪士尼的 Disney+ 的月费价格为 7.99 美元。来源

大家好 ，我是加勒比考斯。
很高兴再次和大家见面~
前言
笔者目前有4台旧的笔记本电脑，而且这4台还一直都在使用，来回切换发现这几台屏幕色差真的不是一般的大啊，而且后续笔者还要做视频，还要换屏幕，所以咬了咬牙，直接在狗东下单了一个Datacolor的红蜘蛛校色仪，后面准备来一个一个进行校正。其中有3台在家里，一台在办公室，咱们先从家中开始。

 
Datacolor的校色仪目前主要分为两个系列，分别是红蜘蛛和蓝蜘蛛，两者在核心校色方面并没有太多差别，都可以正常使用，但是如果你是专业的设计师或者视频工作者，那么推荐选择红蜘蛛，它拥有更多专业向的功能，测试和分析工具也更齐全。

 
考斯目前一共有4台笔记本电脑，这数量也是多的让人发愁，而且还不好淘汰。其中一台是2020年MacBook Air M1丐版，出差修图剪视频使用，不得不说苹果的优化做的真的好，修图剪视频没有比这个更合适的了。

 
第二台是是17年买的一个戴尔游侠游戏本，这个游戏本我拿来打英雄联盟，一个8年的英雄联盟老玩家，每个周都要来几把排位，现在还是青铜段位混，也是丢脸了。
第三台是一个是19年买的荣耀笔记本MagicBook，这台主要是媳妇儿用来看剧用，用起来简单轻便，而且还可以触屏，媳妇儿一直很喜欢。
第四台是公司发的惠普战66笔记本电脑，公司全部都是用的自己的办公套件，想用自己的电脑很难，只能用公司发的电脑。
这4台电脑是每天都在用，但是来回切换后对比后发现这个色差特别严重，尤其是那台游戏本是采用了的TN屏幕，戴尔游戏本屏幕素质真的是创业界新低，而且当初还是7000块钱买的。

    Entering rescue mode...
    grub rescue> ls
    (hd0) (hd1) (hd1,gpt2) (hd1,gpt1)

And the same error I get for (hd0) applies to the other three ((hd1), (hd1,gpt2), and (hd1,gpt1)).
IMPORTANT NOTE:
(hd1,) is my bootstick. Removing it beforehand results in (hd0) (hd0,gpt2) (hd0,gpt1).]]></summary>

When you are reading through this information you will see a lot of phrases like inline caching, hidden classes, and memory offset; but what does it all mean? You'll come across quick one-liners about "always instantiating your object properties in the same order" or, better yet, "assign all of the objects properties in the constructor". You try to dive into the documentation only to see branching charts with a million tiny words in it that look more like Harry Potter's family tree. At the end of all this, you end up just trying to commit those one liners to memory without fully understanding why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


You're probably thinking," what's new with comments?" and you'll be right to think that.

Avoid writing redundant comments
Comments should be updated
Do not excuse bad code with commenting
Comments should not reference other codes
Comments should be informative
Comments could be used to provide links to original source code
Comments should not be used for attribution
The rest of this article explains these guides and provides examples to them.

The above is common among early-beginners as they're introduced to code, While this could be very helpful with teaching beginners. Its considered redundant as it adds no information and merely causes visual clutter.
Overtime comments silently degrade. While code is continuously updated, the comments are forgotten. For a code cryptic in nature, readers turn to the comments to provide an explanation, and when that explanation is false it leaves the readers confused or worse mislead.

The asterisks in the regex pattern show that  it matches a whole lot more than it was stated by the comments which could be very misleading to the readers who do not bother to check the regex pattern.
Commenting should be used as a last resort. Every comment serves as a failure to express yourself clearly in code. Always try to clean the code to express yourself better before resulting to commenting. 

After cleaning it up

A comment should not reference a code that is not present or local because the reference code could change but the comment wouldn't




Comments like these are unacceptable especially in production. The source code control systems can always tell who the author was.
I hope this article has been helpful in highlighting the importance of writing  proper comments and the guides provided were well understood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript has many quirks and difficult-to-understand behaviors. There are hilarious talks such as WTFJS and WAT that make fun of JavaScript for its strangeness.
Since I work on refactorings, I have to consider many weird and sometimes funny sides of JavaScript. I will share some of the surprising behaviors that I encounter, so if you see them (which you hopefully never will), it might hint at what's going on.
This blog post explores an innocent-looking statement:
// ... some code

helloWorld;

You might intuitively think that nothing should happen here - the statement seems to do nothing because there is no obvious function call here.
However, it can do anything, for example, print "Hello World!" to the console.
// ... some code

helloWorld;           // prints "Hello World!"

How can this even be possible?
It turns out that global variables (in this case, helloWorld) are properties of the global object. And properties in JavaScript do not have to be simple values. They can be implemented using getters and setters, which can execute code. Since the global object inherits from Object.prototype in modern JavaScript engines, adding properties to Object.prototype creates properties on the global object.
Here, helloWorld is defined as such a getter:
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {
  get() { console.log("Hello World!"); },
});

helloWorld;           // prints "Hello World!"

Thankfully this can only happen with global variables, and not with parameters or local variables.
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {
  get() { console.log("Hello World!"); },
});

const a = helloWorld; // getter is evaluated, prints "Hello World!"
a;                    // does nothing

I learned about this strange behavior in a blog post about the globalThis polyfill. In the polyfill, a global property getter is used to access the global this object in different environments such as browsers, web workers, frames, Node.js, and ES modules. Have a look if you want to know more!]]></summary>

Hey guys, it's been a long time! If you don't already know me, my name is Ethan and I'm one of a few Peregrine Programming Language developers.

This post will be discussing the progress that has been made.
If you know Python, you know how easy it is. However, it also comes with a big downgrade. Python is slow, and I'm pretty sure every python developer knows this by now. This is kind of annoying. That's where Peregrine comes in. Me and 11 friends have been working on Peregrine for the past few months.

官方的一篇介绍可以参考：从 LiveData 迁移到 Kotlin 数据流 - 掘金
对于初学者来说使用lieveData的好处是足够简单和相对安全
引入flow主要因为以下几点：
具有更友好的API，学习成本较低
跟Kotlin协程、LiveData结合更紧密，Flow能够转换成LiveData，在ViewModel中直接使用
结合协程的作用域，当协程被取消时，Flow也会被取消，避免内存泄漏
flow库隶属于kotlin， livedata属于Android， 拜托Android平台的限制对于未来跨平台发展有利
【flow是个冷数据流】
所谓冷流，即下游无消费行为时，上游不会产生数据，只有下游开始消费，上游才开始产生数据。
而所谓热流，即无论下游是否有消费行为，上游都会自己产生数据。
下边通过一个经典场景详细描述下flow（单纯的flow，而stateFlow会在后续章节中讲解）的使用
案例：一个菜谱应用app中，我想在一个页面展示一个列表（recyclerview） ，此列表的每个item是个子列表，子列表依次为
计划菜谱列表；
收藏菜谱列表；
根据食材筛选的菜谱列表；
根据食材获取用户偏好的菜谱列表；
如图

四个子列表需要四个接口来获取，组装好后来刷新最后的列表
其中每个列表都有可能是空，是emptylist的话这行就不显示了，因为四个接口数据量大小不同，所以不会同一时间返回，同时又要保障这四个子列表按要求的顺序来展示。

When we learn and start using a new language, or especially a framework, we tend to see how some people do something.
But my point is not that after start learning something you start seeing everywhere and all the people using it... but that people will follow “tradition” blindly. In Python, the community has the saying of something being the “pythonic way”.
Yes, you should embrace “tradition” and make things simpler for everyone... except when you don’t.
Many React developers out there will start a project and add Redux (or MobX, or Recoil... ) without even thinking if the project will even need it.
And after they do that, since it’s already there it’s easy to just “go with the motion” and just make things in a way to use Redux.
There’s this story that you might have heard, it’s about someone trying to learn the family recipe of baking fish and that “you have to cut the tail to make it good” and then they would go from parent to grandparent to ask why you have to make the cut only to be told that it’s “how it’s always been done to make it good”, and finally the great grandparent will say that the oven was too small back in the day and they had to cut it to fit...
And as history repeats itself, if you found anything I’m saying eerie familiar, then yes, more than 10 years ago Uncle Bob wrote that developers would start a project with a database because “you always needed a database right?”.
Redux is just one of the latest... moment.js, Lodash, jQuery... remember then?
Remember that the problem is not if you are or not using then, but WHY are you using it.

I'm going to date myself here, but I remember the first time my grandfather let me play on his computer. Back then, it had no mouse. We had to use the arrow keys and the enter button the navigate the files. Oh, and the internet? That didn't exist yet. But when it did, we needed a phone line and an awful screech to tell us when we were connected. 
I grew up alongside the biggest advances in technology. I know computers practically as well as I know how to drive a car. However, it wasn't until 2021 when life hit me hard that I even considered making a career out of anything computer related.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IIFE



An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
Since our application may incorporate a large number of functions and global variables from various source files, it's critical to keep the number of global variables to a minimum.
We could utilize the IIFE pattern if we have some initiation code that we don't need to use again. Because we won't be reusing the code, IIFE is preferable than a function declaration or a function expression in this scenario.
(function () {
  // some initiation code
  let firstVariable;
  let secondVariable;
})();

firstVariable and secondVariable will be discarded after the function is executed.

We would also use IIFE to create private and public variables and methods.

The Scope Chain is the hierarchy of scopes that will be searched in order to find a function or variable.

Credits- Anuradha Aggarwal
When a variable is used in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine will try to find the variable’s value in the current scope. If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.
If it’s still could not find the variable, it will either implicitly declare the variable in the global scope (if not in strict mode) or return an error.
The Scope Chain is used to resolve variables. When asked to resolve a variable, JavaScript always starts at the innermost level of the code nest and keeps jumping back to the parent scope until it finds the variable …]]></summary>

Linux Kernel 5.12.1
ps | grep 关键字

学习Linux都会知道上面这样一行命令，中间的竖线其实是匿名管道，将前一个命令的输出，作为后一个命令的输入。
实质这里执行了跨进程，本文分析一下。
涉及多少个进程？
先说结论，在shell下执行ps|grep，涉及shell、ps和grep三个进程
查看当前shell的进程id：
echo $$

输出当前shell的pid是3347
再查看当前的进程列表，打印出进程的父进程id：
ps o pid, ppid, comm | grep ""

PID    PPID COMMAND
989     968 gdm-x-session
991     989 Xorg
1091     989 gnome-session-b
3347    1947 bash
5018    3347 ps
5019    3347 grep

末尾三个进程就是涉及到的进程，其中ps进程和grep进程的父进程都是shell，因此是shell进程fork出了两个进程。
管道
ps进程数据传递到grep进程，使用了匿名管道。管道的创建，使用了下面的pipe函数：
#include 

int pipe(int fd[2]);

pipe函数通过参数填充返回两个文件描述符，fd[0]是读，fd[1]是写，在fd[1]写入将会在fd[0]读取。

管道的原理本文先不讨论，简单说它是内核的一块内存。
到这个时候，创建的管道还只是一个进程里的事，没有起到进程间通讯的作用。
父子进程之间的通信

上图描述了父进程使用fork创建子进程并使用管道通讯的原理
进程使用task_struct结构描述，进程复制调用的是fork，进程持有的所有fd都会复制一份
父进程使用pipe函数创建一个管道，fd[0]和fd[1]…]]></summary>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
一、HashMap的诞生
1.1 数组
数组：一片物理上连续的大小确定的储存空间。
好处：根据下标快速的查找和修改里面的内容。
缺点：大小确定，无法修改。添加新的元素或者删除元素比较麻烦。

数组的静态初始化
        //数组实现方式一：
        //数据类型 数组名称[] = {值, 值,…}
        String str[] = {"移动端","Android","iOS"};
        System.out.println(str.length);//三个元素
        for (int i = 0; i 
运行结果是一样的。
"E:\Android\Android StudioO\jre\bin\java.exe"...

移动端
Android
iOS

如果我想再添加两个新元素(Java、Kotlin)，那么使用数组就不合适了，这时候顺序表就出现了。
1.2 顺序表
顺序表：以数组的形式保存的线性表，物理上连续、逻辑上连续、大小可以动态增加。(如：ArrayList)
顺序表用的频率远远高于数据。用肯定都会用，咱们看看源码。
public class ArrayList extends AbstractList
        implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
{
    transient Object[] elementData;//存储 ArrayList 元素的数组缓冲区。
    private int size;//ArrayList 的大小

你是否看到别人的 Gradle 文件干净又卫生？而自己的又是一团乱麻🏷
不用怕,本篇将结合我的开发日常，将一些常用的操作分享出来，希望可以帮到像我一样不怎么会[玩]Gradle 的同学，相信会对大家有所帮助。
模板代码提取
这是最基础的操作了，对于一个普通 model.gradle ,默认的配置如下：

如果我们每个 model 都这样写，那岂不是很麻烦，那么让我们提取通用代码：
优化步骤
新建一个 gradle 文件，命名为 xxx.gradle ,复制上述 model 里的配置，放到你的项目中,可以自定义修改一些通用内容，在其他model 中依赖即可,如下所示：
这是一个播放器model
// 这就是刚才新建的默认gradle文件,
// 注意：如果你的default.gradle是在项目目录下，请使用../,如果仅在app下，请使用./
apply from: "../default.gradle"
import xxx.*

android {
  // 用于隔离不同model的资源文件
    resourcePrefix "lc_play_"
}


dependencies {
    compileOnly project(path: ':common')
    api xxx
}

上述的 android{} , dependencies{}
其内部的内容都会在 default.gradle 的基础上叠加，对于唯一的键值对，会进行替换。
定义统一的config配置
在项目中，你是如何去写你的版本号等其他默认配置呢？

对于一个新项目，其默认的配置如下所示，每次新创建 model ,也需要定义其默认参数，如果每次都直接在这里去改动，那么如果版本变化，意味着我们需要修改多次，这并不是我们想看到…]]></summary>

PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛
前言
又是一年新春，在这里先给大家拜个早年了。每逢春节，写春联贴春联都是一项必不可少的活动。本次主要使用Compose，实现手写春联的效果。如果对你有所帮助，欢迎点个赞或者评论鼓励一下~

生成的春联

主要思路
事件监听
我们需要实现手写春联效果，首先就是要做事件监听，Android中自然是监听Action_Down，Action_Move，Action_UP，Compose中应该如何处理呢?
Compose中也可以利用pointerInteropFilter监听Action_Down，Action_Move，Action_UP,如下所示
Column(modifier = Modifier.pointerInteropFilter {
    when (it.action) {
        MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN -> {}
        MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE -> {}
        MotionEvent.ACTION_UP -> {}
        else ->  false
    }
     true
})

路径绘制
当我们手写春联的时候，实际上就是把我们触摸过的点连接起来，最直接的想法当然是通过Path来绘制，即把各个点连接成Path,然后通过drawPath来绘制
drawPath只支持固定的宽度，因此不符合我们的要求。
所以我们换个思路，drawPath其实也是将各个点连接起来，如果我们将触摸过程中的点记录下来，然后在这一系列的点上画圆不就行了吗？每个圆的半径可以自定义，但这样会带来以下问题

可以看出:andro…]]></summary>

事情是这样的，我有一台 asus 的笔记本，自带了 DTS 音效。前两天打 Apex ，发现声音特别小。然后想起来有个东西叫 DTS 音效的 App ，打开一看直接闪退，遂重装该软件和驱动，也重装了声卡相关的驱动。但是没什么用。
必应上面一搜同款机型（同模具）好多都出现了类似问题，找华硕客服也没什么结果，就让你重装驱动，恢复至出厂系统。
可能你会问那 DTS 不好使就不用呗，但是不用的话声音特别小，特别特别小的那种。
于是我就盯上了 Dolby ，之前的旧笔记本装一个带 Dolby 的 Realtek 驱动就能用 Dolby 音效了，因为我现在这个也是 Realtek 声卡（应该是吧），我想现在是不是也这么简单，就装了，果然不好使。
所以有没有懂这个的能指导一下如何安装 Dolby 音频驱动或者怎么让 DTS 能用，另外我也不是很懂我这个电脑的音频架构，感觉好像还和 Intel 有什么关系，不装那个 isst 的驱动就没有声。
折腾的我感觉像回到了 Windows 98 时代哈哈哈

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[21年颇为戏剧和魔幻，事情太多；上下半年的行业巨变，好像经历了两个年头：迟迟没有想好应该怎么做个小结。
回头看，投资似乎是一个不错的固定视角，贯穿全年，总算有点话讲。


往期内容
20年：年终小结：从跨端到内容平台
19年：年终小结，赛道思考与机会判断

一
彼时还没有元宇宙，我在20年Epic Games的哲学与抱负里把metaverse翻作“元世界”（起名的本事真差）。21年开年clubhouse爆红，给metaverse浇了一把新油。
一场上海游戏圈大佬们的秉烛夜谈吸引了无数人在clubhouse围观，Dash老板那句“腾讯的社交不过是纸老虎”言犹在耳（笑），但Steven老板很客气、中肯地作了总结发言。末了，我们听出来了：腾讯心里只有育碧、动视之流；眼里，是半个米哈游。
但在国内，其实还有字节在腾讯眼皮上跳动。


二
都知道字节要做游戏，但in house自建就得尊重内容产业的规律，大力出不了奇迹；于是字节开始一路买买买，从拿产品到买管线，并且高价搅动市场行情。
所以20年下半年开始，腾讯就全面加强在国内的游戏投资，21年尤甚，实行“三不原则”，不干涉经营决策、不主导项目、不寻求发行权。但很多权益上要求排“他”，不要和那谁玩。
神仙打架，跑马圈地，其他厂商也坐不住，只能纷纷跟注。卷起来了，有人就出更高的价钱，拿更少的权益，比口袋深度，卷死你们。战略投资人纷纷退化成了财务投资人，甚至不在乎财务回报的财务投资人（?）；财务机构一看，咱们起跑线一致了，也抓住机会纷纷入局。一时间好不热闹。
当然，钱不迷路，总有人赚。别管是面子还是里子，天底下只有你情我愿的买卖。win-win，都赢麻了。


三
不好说各家成绩单，但加总算下来过去一年超过200个团队拿到钱吧。
对买家来说，有人拿到二次元最后的门票，国产3A的门面，有人拿到成熟的管线、海量的用户，其实价格不重要。
更重要…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由于 HAP（HomeKit Accessories Protocol）的开放性质1，配合 HomeBridge / HomeAssistant 庞大的插件库，几乎做到了万物皆可 HomeKit 的程度。今天我们就来把家中的 PlayStation 游戏机的唤醒和休眠加入到 「家庭」应用中并控制。

本文以 HomeBridge 为例，HomeBridge 运行在 Ubuntu 系统的树莓派上。安装和使用 HomeBridge 请参考这篇文章：HomeBridge 操作指南：从零开始，将你的米家设备接入 Homekit
本次接入的原理是根据 Github 上开源的 PlayStation 唤醒软件进行配置，再接入到 HomeBridge 调用运行配置好的唤醒软件。从而达到曲线救国的 PlayStation 的 HomeKit 化，接下来我们就分步骤进行安装与配置。
安装控制软件
本方法使用 playactor 控制软件来操控 PlayStation 系统。由于 PlayStation 并不支持传统的 WoL ，现在有的方法原理都是基于索尼自家的 PS Remote Play 这款软件的原理进行开发的。

根据 playactor 项目的文档，本项目支持 PS4 的全部操作和 PS5 的部分操作。在加入 HomeKit 之后我们仅需要用到 Wake 与 Standby 两个指令即可。


 PS4PS5
Wake✅✅
Standby✅✅
Keyboard control✅❌
Key/Button press✅❌
App/Game start✅❌


首先我们进入到运行 HomeBridge 的主机中，安装软件。在终端中输入：
sudo npm install playactor
等待安装完成。如果是 Docker 中运行的 HomeBridge 请直接在 HomeBridge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我还记得自己第一次见到 Surface Laptop Go 是在北京三里屯的一家顺电。对自己的 MacBook Pro 早已审美疲劳的我，说实话，对 Surface 系列的设计一直都是十分欣赏的。3:2 的 12.4 英寸屏幕比例、舒适的键盘和触控板，以及触摸屏 —— Surface Laptop Go 符合一切我对于上网本的期待。只不过，当时的我只是简简单单的欣赏，并没有什么购买欲。
情况在今年发生了改变。首先是，我把用了多年的 2016 款 13 英寸 MacBook Pro 出掉了，换了 M1 的 Mac mini 作为日常使用的 Mac 机器。这是因为，尽管 MacBook Pro 十分便携，它的性能早已跟不上我的需要了。至于移动办公的需求，单位配发的 Dell Latitude 7390 实际上体验尚可，如果它不是那么快就坏掉了的话。
LOL，线过于杂乱，请勿介意
如今的轻薄笔记本，其实有不少的选择。一来，MacBook Air 因为配备了 M1 处理器而变得性能强劲且续航优秀；二来，在 Windows 阵营，联想小新、小米、华为等一众国产品牌推出的轻薄款笔记本无论是性能还是价格都还不错。至于我为什么最终选择了 Surface Laptop Go，主要原因是这样的：首先，我也已经提到了我对这款笔记本的设计钟爱有加。考虑到 12.4 英寸 3:2 的屏幕，它看起来小巧精致，但是在内容的显示上倒是也毫不含糊，相比 16:9 或者 16:10 的传统比例，能够显示的内容更多。其次，最近对于 Excel 的高需求，让我无法安心使用一台 Mac 电脑承担所有的工作；加之 MacBook Air 在 2022 年有极大的可能更新设计与处理器，现在的我已经不敢轻举妄动。最后，其他厂商的笔记本尽管性能上要强劲许多，但是在设计上总有那么一些让我觉得不太舒服的地方。总之，说服自己买 …]]></summary>

许多搜索引擎会通过用户输入的关键词、搜索历史、浏览记录、停留时间来收集用户可能感兴趣的内容，进而针对性地投放个性化广告。而无追搜索就号称不进行这种用户追踪行为。
无追搜索承诺，不收集不追踪用户个人信息，也没有繁杂的个性化广告。（并不是完全没广告，而是没有与你搜索行为相关的广告）值得一提的是，无追搜索实现隐私保护的关键，是在默认情况下不使用 Cookie 。
无追搜索的最大特点是在无追搜索中，用户行为数据会被去标识化，也就是用户输入的关键词、点击的链接、访问时间、停留时长等数据会被收集。
但是在经过技术处理后，这些信息无法识别到特定的个人，再搭配无追搜索没有账号体系的特点，用户隐私确实能够得到一定的保障。

用了 10 年 Android 设备，今年想要个趁手的平板，选择了 iPad mini 6 。
当我想把以前的照片导入到 iPad 上的时候，问题出现了：
使用 iTunes 导入，相当于把电脑的目录同步到 iPad 上，但 iPad 却不能删除某个照片，只能插线到电脑上，在电脑上删除照片，再重新把这个目录同步到 iPad 中；
使用爱思助手，拷贝进去之后，也不能在 iPad 端删除拷进去的照片，估计和 iTunes 调的是一样的 API ；
这下终于体会到了苹果的设计哲学，你必须按照它设想的场景去使用，必须使用 iCloud 云服务，否则你手里的设备就是一坨 SHIT 。
必须组合使用 Mac+iPad+iPhone+iWatch 才能达到所谓的“体验”，一旦你有一台 Windows 、Android 设备，想把他们一期使用，绝对是灾难，其中那个不兼容的搅屎棍一定就是苹果。]]></summary>

常年居家办公中，桌子不够大，目前只有一台显示器。
显示器分别接公司的 Macbook Pro 和自己的 Mac mini M1 ，两台电脑都配有各自的 Magic Keyboard 和 Mouse 。
目前的做法是，需要用哪台电脑的时候从显示器的 Input 里选源。
之前遇到的问题是，有时候切换 Input 后电脑无法识别出显示器，需要切断显示器电源才可以识别，非常的痛苦。
目前我在想到的是通过一个 KVM 来解决，但市面上 KVM 产品鱼龙混在，考虑到以下因素：
1 、是否支持 Type C 口（因为我的两台电脑都是 Type C 输出，显示器也支持 Type C ）
2 、不需要共享鼠标键盘，越简单越好（便宜？）
3 、是够支持 60HZ 刷新率（有些设备貌似就只能到 30HZ ）
4 、是否支持反向充电（目前我的两台电脑都是通过显示器的线反向充电的）
各位大神有什么高见不~ 谢谢~]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[huangya: 
我在闲鱼上卖个 AP ，但是当时没细看买家的情况，只看了有一千多单，主要是远程装系统和清理系统的单子。
买家卖前还让我提供各种 web 截图，问各种功能。因为我对路由器和 AP 非常懂，所以也一一给他回答了。发出之前，我还专门测试了一天多，跑了 100 多 G 流量。当时没太在意就给他发货了。并且是我付的快递费用。
后来卖家收到后过了一天，说不能上网，要退货。我看到是连着 AP 的，这在技术上很难讲通的。然后就要他 ping 一下是否能 ping 通主路由。然后就要远程来看一下。卖家死活不愿意，还说自己每天要下地干活，6 点钟起来晚上 8 点钟回来，装模作样还说要视频给我看。当时在上班就没有视频，他就要给我拍了个视频，我一看，就在马路旁边的一块地里。后来就深入看了一下卖家的情况和当时的交易记录，发现卖家也卖路由器和 AP ，稍微懂点皮毛技术。他的评价明显就是刷出来的。卖家还会用软路由爬墙。卖家说自己是农民工，兼职干 IT. 呵呵，V 友相信吗？反正卖家谎话一堆，漏洞太多了，V 友想听的话，我可以 append.
所以，我推测卖家退货可能有其他原因，比如他本来想卖给其他人（买家卖路由器和 AP 基本上是同城交易），但由于各种原因，没卖掉，就找我退货。故意截了两张不能上网的图。其实这图很容易伪造形成，只要把 AP 连接在主路由的网线拔掉就可以。由于怕露馅，就死活不让我远程看。我就拒接退货。中间跟他拉拉扯扯，搞了好久。越扯发现买家的谎言越多，骗子的本性也暴露越多。后来我主动请客服加入。现在结果出来了，但让我不解的时候，
判决结果是“淘宝支持卖家"（如图）, 但是仍然让我提供”退货地址",并且短信也让我确认默认地址是否正确，同时短信也提到邮寄回来的费用是买家负责。所以这个判决结果，到底是淘宝支持我还是支持买家？如果是支持买家，我真是对闲鱼客服失望透顶。看来以后卖二手，我是必须要严加审核，加个“骗子，二道无良贩子有多远滚多远，死一户口本”了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌移除了 Chromium 的预置搜索引擎的“移除”按钮

我们都知道，如果你不想要浏览器预置的默认搜索引擎，可以从浏览器设置中移除它。然而，最近的 Chromium 97 的更新对这些设置进行了 修改，移除了预置的搜索引擎的“移除”按钮。Chromium 开发者对此回应称，删除这些搜索引擎“具有不可恢复的破坏性，因为即使你有足够的知识来使用添加对话框重新创建一个预填充的条目，也不能设置建议、新标签页或其他专门的 URL”。因此，他强烈倾向于“菜单中根本没有删除选项”。其它基于 Chromium 的浏览器，如 Chrome、Edge ，也将无法移除预置搜索引擎。


老王点评：我觉得这是一种邪恶的解决方案，即便如其所说，无法手工重新恢复预置信息，也可以提供一个恢复按钮，而不是剥夺用户删除的自由。




youtube-dl 网站的托管商被各大唱片公司起诉

之前，RIAA 曾经试图施压 GitHub，以关闭 youtube-dl 项目，虽然这一努力最终以失败而告终。但是现在索尼、环球和华纳正在 起诉 Uberspace，该公司目前是 youtube-dl 的官方主页的托管者。他们称，youtube-dl 给他们的业务带来了风险，使用户能够通过规避 YouTube 的技术措施下载他们艺术家的版权作品。因此，如果 Uberspace 不希望自己承担法律责任，就不应该通过托管其网站来参与该工具的运作，该工具本身托管在其他地方。


老王点评：要是 youtube-dl 下一步把网站托管到 GitHub pages 上会怎么样。




俄罗斯逮捕了多名 REvil 勒索软件黑帮成员

俄罗斯联邦安全局周五 宣布，应美国当局要求逮捕了 14 名 REvil 勒索软件黑帮成员，扣押了大量现金、加密货币和和计算机、汽车等资产。REvil 是近期最活跃的勒索软件组织之一，在美国向俄罗斯施压之后，REvil 在去年 7 月关闭了服务器，但其管理员在 9 月尝试重启业务，随后其暗网网站遭到美国执法机构关闭，之后彻底消失。


老王点评：终于被俄罗斯官方拿下了。]]></summary>

今天一个亲戚说孩子考试才得了 86 分， 班级倒数， 我以为现在小学生满分是 150, 他说是 100
我简直被镇碎了，现在的孩子都这么厉害吗，86 分都是倒数了？
我们那时候我记得 60 分以下的都是一大堆， 各位数的才有资格当倒数。
他说是怕孩子高中被分流， 想办法要给孩子补课。 我觉得现在的家长是恐慌性补课， 他们想的不是什么成才， 而是不能被别人挤下桥。
个人认为这简直是反人类的， 一个小屁孩都要这么卷吗？]]></summary>

项目是 django 使用 celery 做一些异步任务执行。
目前发现部署后，django view 中调用 celery 异步执行任务时，遇到一个诡异的问题
方法中的一条模型查询语句，在该异步方法被执行一定次数后会直接卡死。
但是我改成直接用 django.db.connections 执行 sql 语句去查询结果，就没这个问题。  
目前发现异步任务方法大概被执行一定数量范围后，就会触发卡死的问题。
而且在这个次数范围内必现。  
当次执行卡死后，再次执行该异步任务，大概率就不会卡死了。  
不知道有没有其他小伙伴遇到这么诡异的问题的，或者有没有原因的可能思路。
django 版本用的是 2.1.5
celery 版本是 4.4.2
感激不尽。]]></summary>

可能我的文字描述的会有些不清楚，我用 pr 剪出了一个 gif ，期望的效果可以参考下面这张 gif(注意不是选中该 option ，select 框中的值并没有改变)

最近在管理 gradle / maven 写的源码，想问下平时是不需要做这个传递依赖的冲突检查吗，等抛出异常的时候才做还是每次安装依赖的时候都要做一次？
最怕的问题在于不知道为什么编译期的版本冲突没有检查出来。而我们已经依赖了好多个 library,例如库 A 依赖 库 C 和库 D 的 1.0 ，但是库 B 是依赖库 C 和 D 的 2.0 。
我在网上看了 maven 和 gradle 会自动帮我以某种最短路径策略去选择依赖库。但是这种选择我也不懂是不是能够保证选择出来的版本就是没问题的，总不能每次都重新测试整个 app 吧。
而这种传递依赖的层级可能有 3/4 层。而我恰好前两天就遇到一个 java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError 。查了一下好像是关于依赖不兼容的问题， 编译期间没有检查出来，还是使用哪个 method 的时候才出现的 runtime exception 。
问题是我在最上层 dependency management 例如写了是 2.0 ，那我也不能保证依赖 1.0 的一定没问题的。但写成 2.0 的，那风险也同样大。
所以想向大家求教应该怎么做依赖的管理的最好方法。谢谢大家]]></summary>

引言
回头去看 2021，过的似乎那么快，不敢相信我已经从事 Android 开发两年了，不免生出一些感叹。
那么 2022 ，Android 端会有什么技术趋势吗？或者什么 [新] 技术值得去学? 又或者对我来说，现在什么 [值得] 去学？
本文将通过我个人的技术学习经历去分析我们应该怎么选用某个技术，希望对大家能有所帮助。
回头看
让我们把时间切回过去，最近几年我都给自己加了哪些技术点？
2019-2020
Kotlin，协程
MVP，Hilt，MVVM ,JetPack 相关
热修复
Flutter 浅试
自动化、持续集成相关
2021-2022
JetPack Compose
Epoxy+Mvrx , MVI
看完这个表，是不是惊叹于，我靠，你小子 2021 等于啥都没学啊？
说来尴尬，当我自己从博客记录从翻阅时，也有这份感叹，对于 [新技术] ，真的好像没怎么看了，所以在年终总结上，我发出了这样一句感叹，今年用的组件都是以前学过的，只不过忘了，又翻出笔记看了一眼。
但仔细又想了下，2021新技术真的好像没有多少，对于 Android 端而言，Compose 算一击重拳，而 MVI 又是最近因为 Compose 被正式启用为 Google 推荐 [新] 架构标准，其他的好像真的没有。
Google今年推过的技术
如果我们只将技术定义为 [技术组件] ，那就可能太狭义，所以那就细细列举一下今年 Google 推过的那些技术文章：
如何找到呢，那么 Android开发者 公众号就是最优先的。所以我们就通过其发布过的文章，大致统计一下，Android 官方给我们的建议，我排了一个表，大致如下:
JetPack
Navigation 、Hilt、WorkManager、ActivityR…]]></summary>

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

引子：这一次，咱们来聊聊摩托车
首先，作为少数派 Matrix 社区的新人作者，在新的一年里，向大家问好。
关注少数派很长时间了，有幸能看到这么多优秀的人和优秀的文章，也许是由于少数派是以科技和效率为主的网站，尽管在分享「生活方式」的文章中，有关「摩托」的话题也不是很多。（当然除了摩托罗拉），所以在这里我想和各位少数派的朋友分享一下「我为什么骑摩托车」。
不得不说，确实是刘德华主演的电影《烈火战车》给我埋下了摩托车的种子，但是在家人眼中，摩托车常常与「危险、浮躁、不正经」等贬义词挂钩。好在我从没提过想骑摩托车，所以也免去了在购买前和家人辩论的过程。
《烈火战车》剧照，图片来自豆瓣
随着近几年短视频的兴起，机车文化得到了一定的传播和发展，并且得益于各地「禁摩令」不同程度地取消，摩托车也成为了越来越多人的出行和生活方式，如果你也有兴趣入坑机车，那本文会有我的一些建议可供参考，另外为了提升易读性，本文不涉及动力、扭矩等参数。推荐入坑前可以关注「哈罗摩托」、「骑士网」等相关网站获取更专业的信息。如果有问题也可以直接在评论或私信中向我提问。
从复古车型到入手爱车
尽管很多摩友入坑的多数目的是追求速度与激情，但是我一直认为速度附带的刺激程度和危险系数是同等的，刺激和危险并不能形成对冲关系，所以在选购方面，我第一时间排除了仿赛车型（偏速度），只留意复古车型。

hello 大家好，我是《Flutter开发实战详解》的作者郭树煜，看标题就知道今天我要给大家分享的是 Flutter 相关的主题，分享内容是也比较直接简单，就是关于 Flutter 布局相关的知识点。
相信大家可能都听说过或者用过 Flutter ，对这部分内容可能有一定了解，但是正如标题所示，本次的主题是带你了解不一样的 Flutter ，或者说经常性被萌新忽略的东西 ，所以这次将通过不一样的角度，带你看看 Flutter 的尺寸布局有趣的地方。
一、开始之前
在聊 Flutter 的布局之前，首先大家觉得 Flutter 是什么？
Flutter 其实主要是跨平台的 UI 框架，它核心能力是解决 UI 的跨平台，和别的跨平台框架不一样的地方在于：它在性能接近原生的同时，做到了控件和平台无关的实现。
但如果大家用过 Flutter ，应该知道 Flutter 里的我们写的界面都是通过 Widget 完成，并且可能会看起来嵌套得很多层，为什么呢？
这里就要先简单说一下 Flutter 的一些基础信息，在 Flutter 里有 Widget 、 Element、 RenderObject 、 Layer 等关键的核心设定。

其中我们最常写的 Widget 并不是真正的 View 实例，它需要转化为对应的 RenderObject  才能绘制，而 Element 是 Widget 和 RenderObject 关键的中间实例，我们日常 Flutter 开发里用到的 BuildContext 就是 Element 的抽象对象。
也就是大致 Widget -> Element -> RenderObject 这样的过程。
所以在 Flutter 里 Widget 代码只是“配置文件”的作用，真正工作的实例是它内部对应的 Element 和 Re…]]></summary>

上一篇：OkHttp 精讲：CacheInterceptor
开胃菜
在讲这个拦截器之前，我们先补充一点网络基础，大部分人应该都知道 Http 和 Https 之间最大的区别，就是使用了加密传输让请求更加安全，但是大多数人却不知道 Http 不同版本之间的区别。
Http 1.0 和 Http 1.1 变化最大的地方在于，Http 1.1 拥有长连接的特性，那么问题来了，什么是长连接？
我们都知道 Http 是基于 TCP 衍生出来的一种应用层协议，我们大可认为 Http 是 TCP 的子类，而一提及 TCP，大家可能第一想到的就是三次握手，每次建立连接之前都会发三次网络信号来确定是否建立连接，这种模式在 Http 上面也有，只不过在 Http 1.0 和 Http 1.1 有一些区别，Http 1.0 每次请求网络都需要进行三次握手，请求完毕之后连接就自动断开了，而 Http 1.1 对这块的内容进行了优化，在每次请求完毕之后并没有立即把连接断开，而是将这个连接复用起来，下次请求网络的时候不经过三次握手，而是直接建立连接，这个就是 Http 1.1 的长连接特性。
这样的好处在于，因为三次握手是需要消耗时间和资源的，如果每次请求网络都需要三次握手才能建立连接，那么在这种条件下，无疑对服务器形成了一定的压力负担，同样的客户端也会受到一定的影响，所以复用三次握手可以极大减轻服务器的压力和提升客户端的响应速度。
Http 1.1 和 Http 2.0 变大最大的地方在于，Http 2.0 拥有多路复用的特性，那么问题又来了，什么是多路复用？
由于 Http 1.1 的长连接特性只能处理单个请求， 这样的话请求一多就会导致排队的情况出现，若干个请求排队串行化单线程处理，后面的请求等待前面请求的返回才能获得执行机会，一旦有某请…]]></summary>

通常情况下，我们在做小红点效果的时候，会有两种选择：
自定义BadgeView，然后设置给目标View
xml写一个View，然后设置shape
有的同学可能会想，能实现不就行了吗，是的，代码优不优雅、骚不骚的不重要，代码和人只要有一个能跑就行...
不过，今天来介绍一种不同的方式来实现小红点效果，或许会让你眼前一亮~
2.效果

3.简介

用途：给View添加动态显示信息（小红点提示效果）
app主题需使用Theme.MaterialComponents.*
api 要求18+ 也就Android 4.3以上（api等级对应关系）
4.实现拆解
4.1TabLayout

xml:
    

        

        

        

    

kotlin:
    private fun initTabLayout() {
        // 带数字小红点
        mBinding.tabLayout.getTabAt(0)?.let {
            it.orCreateBadge.apply {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ansible 是一个开源的自动化工具，可以以多种方式使用。以下是几个去年最受欢迎的 Ansible 教程和故事。




自动化不断改善着 IT 团队中每个人的生活。Ansible 可以帮助任何使用 IT 自动化的人，不管是为了保持文件的有序性还是配置打印机，或者是为了任何其他可以想象和构建的东西。这些是 2021 年我们分享的一些最引人注目的使用案例和经验。

无论你是第一次听说 Ansible，还是一个经验丰富的用户，这些文章都会有你的收获。


Ansible 的创始人 Michael DeHaan 分享了他对自己如何被引向 IT 自动化的想法。这篇访谈对 Ansible 是如何诞生的 以及随着时间的推移而发展的信息和见解都非常好。

当你作为一个系统管理员可以将许多日常任务自动化时，自动化可以节省一天的时间。了解如何使用 Ansible 为 五个日常的系统管理员任务 实现自动化流程。

你的下载文件夹中充满了垃圾吗？介绍一个简单的方法，用一个简单的剧本来清理你系统上的文件。它很容易扩展，计划好后，就会按照你的要求频繁运行。了解更多关于 用 Ansible 删除文件。

如果你正在 写 Ansible 剧本，可以用四行代码改善它们。想想下一个用户，特别是当你在一个项目上合作的时候。一个小的努力可以防止大的问题。

Ansible 社区已经采取了措施，通过审查其代码库和更新语言，使该项目更具包容性。请看 Ansible 术语变化 的总结。

从你的 Ansible 剧本中调用 API，就像一个专业人员一样！找出每个人都应该知道的关于 利用剧本中的 REST API。

有一些应该每天、每周或每月运行的计划任务？使用 Ansible 和 anacron 来设置任务，利用时间戳而不是计划时间，所以即使你的机器在计划时间关闭，它也会在重新开启时运行。

如果你刚刚开始使用 Ansible，也许你需要一些方向来开始。这里有 每个人都可以使用 Ansible 的 10 种方法。

当社区一起工作时，奇迹就会发生。这不仅仅是代码：了解 Ansible 如何构建设计系统，创建可重用的品牌资产以供社区使用。如果你是设计师或社区经理，你会特别欣赏这个故事。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你曾经尝试过使用 Arch Linux，你就知道如果没有适当的文档和 Linux 知识，几乎不可能安装它。而实际上，这就是 Arch Linux 的 魅力。

但由于 Arch Linux 属于专业级的 Linux 发行版，因此有几个 基于 Arch 的发行版，它们试图让普通人可以更轻松地使用它们。

当谈到 “基于 Arch 的 Arch 替代品” 时，Manjaro 和 EndeavourOS 是两个最受欢迎的选择。

所以让我们来看看这两个的区别。为什么你要选择其中一个而不是另一个？



桌面变体

这两个发行版都有多种桌面风格。Manjaro 有三种官方风格：Xfce、KDE 和 GNOME。此外还有社区版：Budgie、Cinnamon、Deepin、Mate、Sway 和 i3。

Endeavour OS 官方提供了更多的变体。除了 Manjaro 所拥有的那些，它还有 LXQT、BSPWM、Openbox 和 Qtile。

由于每种风格都有不同的 桌面环境（DE）及特定于该桌面的捆绑应用程序。这就导致了没有一个“严格”的最低系统要求基线。

根据 EndeavourOS 的网站，下面是每种桌面环境对内存的系统要求清单（对 Manjaro 也应该是一样的）：


Xfce - 至少 2GB 内存，但建议 4GB。

Mate - 至少 2GB 内存，但建议 4GB。

Cinnamon - 需要至少 4GB 的内存

Gnome - 至少需要 4GB 的内存（假设对 KDE 相同）

Budgie - 至少需要 4GB 的内存

Plasma - 至少需要 4GB 的内存

LXQT - 至少需要 2GB 的内存，但建议 4GB


获取 ISO

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[转眼间都 2022 了，2021 年就这么过去了，最后一段时间感觉忙得完全没有概念。
上周看到各位博主都在写年终总结了，那么在元旦放假期间也来一篇总结一下这一年。
1. 工作
工作上，这一年是我在字节跳动-懂车帝的第三年了，随着时间的推进，加上努力、机遇、运气的交错碰撞上，个人的职责也在慢慢地发生变化。
这三年从初期的业务支撑，到专注于工程架构和性能优化，再到后面的整体考虑技术规划等。
从比较单一的视角，到全局视角去看待一些问题，这一过程也是不断的在摸索和进步，认知自己各种不足与调整。
这三年给我的感觉就是运气还不错，个人技术成长、综合素质上都有所提升，当然了这个职责变化过程中。
在这一年公众号的推文中，大家在评论区，评论的最多的，可能就是：
「学不动了」，「又开始卷了」。
当然这两个评论和推文是有关系的，我个人可能更倾向于推送：大厂分享、性能优化、字节码、源码分析等等的文章。
这些文章都比较枯燥，导致大家静不下心来看，所以发这样的感悟比较正常，当然也有像虾哥这样的卷王故意调侃的。
我个人觉得，在工作初期，技术是程序员的立命之本，还是要保持好自己的技术竞争力的，在自己能力范围内，可以尽量的多尝试一些技术，扩宽自己的解决问题的思路，总是没坏处的。
当然学习技术也是有技巧的，例如大家做应用层App 的，就会自然的觉得搞framework、搞Linux内核、音视频底层的比较厉害，想去学。
追求深度是没有问题的，但是还有个更重要的点需要考虑：
当前工作中最需要的技术是什么？中长期团队的规划是什么样的？
围绕着团队规划去扩宽自己的技术栈，尽可能在团队发展过程中出一份自己的力、解决团队中的痛点，让自己的能力与产品/团队同向进步，这样个人在职场的状态会越来越好。
当然技术也不是唯一重要的，沟通能力、规划能力、管理能力这些都很重要，工作过程中尽量去提升，多承担一些可以锻炼自己的工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I made a website to make us easily share links between our devices.
https://www.linkshared.io/
Many times when we found something interesting and wanted to share a link from one's phone or laptop to her desktop so we can both watch it on the big screen, we had to send the link by email, or sent to her phone via some app and she had to copy the link from her phone to the PC, Or we have to download some apps, etc.. The process was really annoying.
Therefore, we decided to make a website that can allow people share link by simply visit our webpage.
This webpage will hold the shared link for 2 minutes, for now, and people can share the link via a share code so other people can access the shared text.
Steps are very simple:
Share your text on the website.
Use the share code to get your text on other devices. If the text contains a URL, website will detect it and extract the link for you.
We used NextJS to implement both the frontend and backend API.
We opened a free Redislabs account so we can host our cache.
We used the free hosting service provide by Vercel.
We brought a domain name on Vercel for $70/yr.
We don't want to make a cloud storage.
We don't want to pay for a cloud storage.
In most use cases, this webpage just works like clipboard, so no long term storage is needed.
We don't want to pay for a cloud storage.

Clipboards across different operating systems work essentially the same. For this reason, we will stick to looking at a single one -- Windows.
A common misconception about how clipboards work is that they contain a single piece of data, such as text or an image. In reality, clipboards hold all the ways target software can represent the data.
Consider if I copy the following webpage:

Sisteminizde yetkili kullanıcı olarak /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf dosyası oluşturup içeriğini aşağıdaki gibi yapabilirsiniz.

What should you do with it? I'm going to walk you through an install with Windows 10. Then we'll talk about what to do with docker.
Before you even install and try to run docker, you should probably understand what it is. Docker is a light-weight way of running a program through containers and microservices. Monolith Server Architecture is a thing of the past because we traditionally hosted resources in one environment. This made it versatile, but also heavy and very difficult to update changes. Microservices are used to split up tasks into specific operations. In the picture below, you can see all the small microservices one interface may be runn…]]></summary>

All UI in Comet is a View, which makes things really simple, right? Other toolkits may split them into controls, layouts, components, widgets, etc. That makes sense since some are best used for containing and organizing, others best for accepting user input, and others for creating beautiful UI. 
Let's take a tour of what's available today in Comet and how you can quickly start composing your UI.
The layouts in Comet extend from ContainerView which itself is a View. These managed views arrange and space child views on the screen, and all adapt to whatever size and density the app runs on. The current layout views include:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to CSS and HTML, application state falls into these categories:
cascade state: classes/checkbox state/other dom

pseudo state: based on current user interaction

animation state: pre-determined series, triggered by cascade and/or pseudo state

transition state: easing between the cascade and/or pseudo states when they change

These are the building blocks for all UX that can be combined in an infinite number of ways[1]. These are all intertwined of course, and we can split hairs on how I've referred to them, but ultimately though; Either our state is static - derived from the current DOM, or it's temporary - derived from the user's current interaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post explains the difference between class_eval and instance_eval methods in Ruby. If you keep getting confused between them when reading or writing Ruby code, it should clarify things a little. 
Consider the Greeting class, which forms the basis of other examples.

class_eval evaluates the string or block in the context of the class, allowing you to reopen the class and define additional behavior on it.
Creating a method inside the block defines an instance method on the class. All Greeting instances can call greet.

This is the same as explicitly defining the greet method in the Greeting class. The above code is equivalent to:

Benefits
The first benefit of class_eval is that you can call it on a variable pointing to a class, allowing you to add behavior to a class dynamically.

O que você irá ler abaixo são apenas alguns dos vários motivos para se usar testes, especialmente desenvolver guiado por testes.
Como um desenvolvedor iniciante, sempre questionei internamente os porquês dos testes, mesmo com todos ao meu redor dizendo sua importância e valor, nunca havia posto em prática as técnicas necessárias para executar bons testes e/ou desenvolver algo totalmente guiado por eles, antes a vida era bem simples, era só montar no cavalo e escrever tudo às cegas, sem planejamento, sem pensar, o belo e não ideal eXtreme Go Horse.

Architecture overview

popup.
background.js
contentscript.js
Let’s build your Chrome extension now.

By clicking the extension icon, we close all open tabs. When you click on the extension, the application should read all open tabs and remove them as well as create a new tab.
Source Github.
Step 1:
Create A New Directory
Open terminal, make a new directory called “close-all-tabs” and open your favorite text editor.
mkdir close-all-tabs
In order for Chrome to load your plugin, the extension files need to be pointed to a folder on your computer. In this directory, you can add all of the files you need for your extension.
Step 2

Step 3
Create a background.js
// toolbar button event listener


Step 4

Step 5

1. Go to chrome://extensions in your browser
To enable Developer mode, check the box in the top right-hand corner, as shown above:
To load an unpacked extension, click Load unpacked extension to bring up the file selection dialog.
The extension will be loaded and active as soon as it is valid! A message will appear at the top of the page if it is invalid. Please correct the error and try again.

It’s now time to test our chrome extension

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[移动端App架构Demo
项目地址：https://github.com/yeshu-cn/mock_app
通过分层和接口的架构设计，实现可以快速Mock,单元测试的APP实例。

功能
登录，注册。
发帖，帖子列表，评论。
帖子点赞和帖子收藏。
修改用户昵称和头像。
架构
三层结构：业务层，持久层，展示层。
本地实现业务逻辑。
使用内存来实现持久层。
ui:展示层，主要负责数据展示和用户交互。
domain:业务层，利用抽象的Repository和Service接口实现业务逻辑UseCase，UseCase作为Api接口提供给三方使用。
data:持久层具体实现。
di: 通过ServiceLocator简单实现依赖注入，达到控制反转。

domain层和data层中的代码，根据需求可能直接移动到服务端，就是常见到Server/Client模式。

思考
和朋友讨论时，他问我这架构里面UI数据的缓存代码怎么写，怎么做网络请求的优化？
写这个Demo出来目的是根据代码职责，理清代码所在层次和所属角色。
具体的缓存策略和网络请求的优化，这个属于业务的具体实现，它的实现方法有各种各样，不是架构关心的内容，架构关心的是你的UI缓存代码肯定不能放在Domain中，你的网络请求优化代码肯定不能在Repository中。]]></summary>

我有个海外版电视盒子，安装了影视类的应用来看剧，但看着看着就会出现看 10 秒卡 2 秒（出现一个加载的圈）。我不清楚到底是什么原因造成的，不同的剧都会出现这个问题，不同的 app 也都出现这个问题，而且由于我担心是无限路由器原因（盒子只能用无线网，路由器距离电视盒子也不远，并且没有墙），所以路由器也换过（固件也试过原装的和自己刷 openwrt ），仍然还是有这个问题，想请教是为什么？
顺便还想问一下有没有什么能刷 openwrt 的，信号好的路由器推荐？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[导语

2020 年末，「推播助栏」回顾了 2020 年听过的众多中文播客，从中选出了 10  个值得追更的中文播客栏目，初衷是为了与播客平台的榜单相区分，不单单推荐单个播客，想更具体一点，分享这些中文播客的优质栏目。
今年「推播助栏」将会延续年度回顾的惯例，同时为了回应 2021 年涌现出的不少敢于尝试、制作成熟的叙事类中文播客，不再从播客子栏目切入，改为分享优秀的叙事类单集。
我从过去一年的当月分享中挑选了 10 集节目，并且新增了 2 集未推荐的节目，一共整理出了 12 集叙事类节目，其中 11 集为非虚构故事，1 集为虚构故事，涉及性别、疫情、巴以冲突、老龄化、躺平等主题。
以下单集节目按照时间的先后顺序进行排列，并附上了podlink链接，点击链接后你既可以在线播放节目，也可以选择常用的播客应用跳转播放，部分节目还附上了节目相关的文稿或采访报道，方便你进一步深入了解相关故事。
 

🌠 2021 年最佳敘事类单集

过刊︱EP20 原创播客剧《你们忘了那扇门》
一集精心制作的播客剧，主要讲述了两位记者候选人前往偏远山区采访拐卖传闻的故事。两位主播专门为故事创作两首歌《冬至》和《破晓》，一头一尾构成了叙事的一部分，故事也在结尾迎来了翻转。
录音质量很高，声音有明显的空间感，有符合人物动作行为必要的配音和配乐，几位参与者的整体表演也不错，末尾有种歌剧的感觉，在叙事的方式上还可以做得更好。

这两集节目都是关于女性议题的，节目制作者不约而同地采取了storytelling的方式，采访多位话题相关者和事件亲历者，结合收集到的现场录音和恰当的配乐，以尽可能多元的角度去呈现事件的全貌，对于性别话题的公共讨论非常有价值。

假设现在有商城和会员两个服务，用户在商城使用积分购买商品，但是用户的积分是存储在会员服务的。
现在的流程如下：

扣减积分发生在会员服务中，创建订单及修改订单状态为已支付发生在商城服务中，所以会出现“扣减了积分，但是没有成功创建订单”这种情况。
应该怎么解决这个问题呢？]]></summary>

我是 GPON 本以为正常是升级 XG PON ，谁知道电信不按常理出牌，给我换了个 10G EPON ，也不知道电信咋想的，估计这个 10G EPON 只有我一家用。光率也从-24 到了-15 。
今儿换完后还是没弄利索，直接沿用原来的 LOID ，拨号后网速只有 100M ，明儿电信线路员接着来我家弄。
PS：其实我的真实意图是跟电信砍砍价，把资费给我降个三五十块就行，因为就这点破事拖了近两个月时间，我也拖够了，再有就是下行对我来说也无所的，多 200M 300M 和少 200M 300M 也没啥分别，下行带宽本来就是不值钱的东西。谁成想电信就是不跟我提用降低资费的解决这茬，最后还真给我换了。]]></summary>

在 android 学习中，学习 activity 返回获取结果，有这样的代码
override fun onActivityResult(
        requestCode: Int,
        resultCode: Int,
        data: Intent?
    ) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
        when (requestCode) {
            1 -> if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                val returnedData = data?.getStringExtra("data_return")
                Log.d("FirstActivity", "returned data is $returnedData")
            }
        }
    }

在 result = RESULT_OK 中，RESULT_OK 是定义在 android.app.activity ，且为 public static final 修饰。
我自定义类为 FirstActivity （也是重写的 onActivityResult 所在的类），继承自 AppCompatActivity ，而 AppCompatActivity 是从 android.app.activity 一路继承下来的，那我的理解就是我自己定义的 FirstActivity 也有 RESULT_OK 这个常量。那么按理来说应该这个语句可以写为：
result = AppCompatActivity.RESULT_OK
或
result = FirstActivity.RESULT_OK
但是实际上只有result = AppCompatActivity.RESULT_OK不报错（但是会显示为灰色，估计意思是写 AppCompatActivity 是多余的），而result = FirstActivity.RESULT_OK报错
就想问 FirstActivity 应该也继承了 RESULT_OK ，为什么会报错呢

#使用 PLesk+litespeed 加速你的 wordpress 博客
##1.基础配置
linux 服务器一台
PLesk 管理面板
litespeed web 服务器
​      litespeed 和 redis 配合 LScache 缓存插件可以实现 wordpress 内容的快速缓存，而且可以通过 PLesk 面板管理 litespeed 服务器，对新手有更友好，而且安全可靠
##2.控制面板 Plesk
###2.1 系统需求
请确认你的服务器系统是不是 Plesk 所要求的！截止到我写完这篇文章为止，最新版的 debian11 还没有被支持
下图是 Plesk obsidian 版本一键脚本支持的系统，具体需求见(Software Requirements for Plesk Obsidian)
2.2 安装 Plesk
由于 PLesk 官方提供一键安装脚本，所以我们很轻松地就可以安装 Plesk （注意必须是干净的系统）
sh 
安装成功后 root 界面输入“plesk”命令会有如下回显

默认会安装
MariaDB
PHP7.3 和 PHP7.4（扩展基本上都装好了）
Apache 和 nginx web 服务器
想安装其他东西的话可以自己去 plesk installer 安装
##3 设置 plesk
访问   https://你的 ip  你会看到 PLesk 的登陆界面 ，使用服务器 root 和密码登录后，这里提示会让你激活 plesk 需要 key 输入即可
Tips:关于 PLesk 的 key 可以去良心云的云市场看看，他们一般都会提供免费的 PLesk one 的 key ，实际也够用了
4.更换 web 服务器为 litespeed
4.1 更换条件
根据 litespeed 的政策：需要更换为 litespeed…]]></summary>

你点开了你非常喜欢的电影「色戒」，你想要的资源就在界面右侧，触手即达，在线观看

亲测了下，电影资源还是挺丰富的，个人平时经常在豆瓣上找电影、纪录片等，但因为很多资源国内都没有，就得自己去找，还是挺麻烦的，发现这个脚本挺好用的，可以试试。]]></summary>

complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s
the big deal?
But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for
the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s
not just caching problems!
So I asked people on Twitter for
example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t
initially appear to be DNS problems. (the popular “it’s always DNS” meme)
I’m not going to discuss how to solve or avoid any of these problems in this
post, but I’ve linked to webpages discussing the problem where I could find
them.

Your network requests are a little bit slower than expected, and it’s actually

->
I subscribe a newspaper or I subscribe a 

那在 Rx 的概念里，newspaper company 有数据（也就是每日晨报）要发送，是一个可订阅或者说可 Observe 的东西，所以应该是 Observable 的一个实例）。
而『我』抽象出来的话应该是一个 Observer 类型（具有订阅的能力，并且在获得到订阅的东西后有一些行为）
所以写成代码后应该是 I.subscribe(newspaperCompany)
然而
interface Observable {
    Subscription subscribe( Observer s )
}
所以 RxJava 里应该写成 newspaperCompany.subscribe(I)
就让我非常难顶。
实在不行，这个方法名能不能从 subscribe 改成 register 啊，
newspaperCompany.register(I)  --> 报纸发行商把订阅报纸的我注册在要发每日晨报的名单里了  我一下子就觉得好理解和舒服得多
这里为什么这么设计呢？

试用地址： https://www.fastyotest.com/demo
在我们自己做的一些副业产品中，常常需要对一些业务场景进行滑动验证码的接入，例如：登录注册、抢购秒杀、发帖风控 等，但前期我们针对目前已存在的产品调研了很久，发现了他们存在许多的问题，其中包括：
recaptcha 即使替换了域名，也会有部分用户反馈无法使用
vaptcha 需要绘制曲线，门槛太高，大部分用户不了解如何使用
极验 /腾讯防水墙 /网易云盾等免费版各种使用限制，很难愉快使用
极验 /腾讯防水墙 /网易云盾等高级版年收费很高，没有按量付费
极验 /网易云盾等不提供多维数据，仅有通过与否一个字段供接入方判断
......
同时我们看到 V2EX 上偶尔会有人寻求相关的产品，因此我们就着手做了一整套验证码服务 - 友验。
那么 友验 和其他产品有哪些不同呢？
按月重置的免费额度 + 按量付费（免费版每月 5W 免费验证额度）
基于风险评分体系，我们提供包括 检测得分、IP 风险、设备指纹 等多个维度数据
编写了包含微信小程序 /PC/H5/iOS/Android...等 SDK 方便你快速接入 
我们从零使用 JavaScript 编写了 JavaScript 编译和解释器用于 VMP ，并且部分开源提供大家使用 
使用公开的浏览器特征和 DOM 规范数据用来训练特征模型，用来识别 puppeteer/selenium/playwright 等 Headless 的伪装 
目前友验已稳定运行，帮助 12 家小公司和 39 名个人开发者抵御了每天总 6 百万次的请求。如果有被薅羊毛、恶意灌水、恶意注册、恶意爬虫所困扰的朋友不妨尝试使用一下 友验 。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[认真生活的人，从来不会被辜负。

大家好，我带着这款有些不一样的日记 App「你的一天」和大家见面了。开发这款 App 的最初想法是，可以用模块化、流水账的形式，记录每个一天的普普通通的生活。也是在用它帮助和督促自己认真对待生活、记录生活。
普通而又独特的「日记」

早上起来，大雨。
心情很糟，今天是周一，还要去上班，又要把鞋子弄得湿漉漉了。
公司的午餐好好吃，天气也放晴了，好开心。

像上面的这段简单的日记一样，每天的心情、地点、天气都是随时间变化的，我特别希望能够随时、随手记录这样的变化，这也是我希望做到的，记录和观察生活的方式。
所以，「你的一天」来了。
图片由「你的一天」生成
像上面一样，可以分别使用文字、图片、声音、位置、天气、心情六种基础模块，帮助你构筑每一个专属于自己的普通而又独特的一天。
日记使用小技巧
接下来，我来悄悄的告诉你一些使用「你的一天」记录日记的小技巧，帮助你更好地使用它。
日记元素排序
每一个日记元素都支持长按拖拽排序，你可以任意组织它们的顺序，甚至还支持跨天移动。
iPad 拖拽添加照片
如果这时候，你的手中恰巧还有一台 iPad，还可以直接拖拽照片进来，拖拽文字也是可以的。这项功能在 iPhone 上也是可以使用的，不过在 iPad 上，使用起来会更加方便。
最棒的是，你不必担心 iPhone 和 iPad 的数据同步，我们使用 iCloud 帮你把所有数据管理起来，这从你第一次打开 App 的时候，就是默认支持的了，不用担心数据的遗失。
筛选记录
如果你已经使用它很长时间了，那么一些有特殊意义的记录，你可以把它标记为喜欢，也可以为它们添加标签。接下来，筛选功能可以帮助你找到曾经喜欢过的记录，同时支持按照喜欢、范围、类型、标签等方式筛选。
爱上物品「收纳」
这是一款关心你生活的 App，而在生活中，第一件事就是将自己的房间、办公室和物品整理…]]></summary>

搅拌机：剁什么剁，这玩意儿不好使吗？
@jijiali：对于一个生活在北方的人来讲，饺子是最普通不过的一种食物。这不仅体现在日常中的三天两头吃饺子，饯行时的「上马馉饳（ɡǔ duo）下马面」，更体现在逢节就是饺子。如此多的场景之下，饺子馅几乎就得天天准备。
作为一个一把菜刀打天下的人，在准备饺子馅儿的时候，我通常办法就是先把肉切成薄片，再把薄片切成肉条，随后把肉条切成小肉里，然后剁成肉馅。蔬菜也是类似的处理之法。最后把它们混合在一起。但是时间久了，也是感到剁个饺子馅太累；尤其是过年，三十晚上与初一连着两顿的饺子。所以，每当遇到饺子（包括馄饨）的时候，就特别的需要一个能代劳的设备。于是乎就有了接下来的这样几种搅拌设备。
手动搅拌器

这种塑料款的搅拌器在地摊上、网络上很常见。纯手工、不需要额外电力、节能环保，美中不足的是有时候需要大力出奇迹。使用时需要用手按住边缘，防止机器默走。整体来讲，少量的蔬菜、肉类还是可以的。当然食材需要预处理一下。
把这款手动搅拌器小型化，把摇把换成拉绳，这样就得到了一个压蒜器。相对来说，这款小机器把大蒜、辣椒或者其他佐料打成蓉状还是比较方便的。
搅拌器升级版——博朗 MQ525（600 瓦）

相对于前面的手动版，勃朗手持式搅拌器由于有电驱动，自然功率会提升了不少。机器两档可调。我最初买这款机器…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如今,智能家居给我们的生活带来了很多便利，对我来说完全是不用不知道，一用回不去的产品，不少家电的操控我现在都是用嘴完成或者是设置条件自动化执行的。目前自己米家APP、Homeassistant同时都在使用，Homeassistant主要用来弥补米家的一些不足，也避免自己被米家生态困住。但是根据网上的不少案例发现Homeassistant下要实现语音控制，似乎非常麻烦，除了要安置一台诸如天猫精灵之类的接入设备，后台的设置也不简单，于是我一番摸索之后想到用手机自带的语音助手实现操控Homeassistant来执行动作。这么一来只需要一台旧手机（无论什么品牌，甚至没有自带语音助手都行）作为语音接入，甚至连天猫精灵、小米蓝牙音箱都省了。但是，需要通过语音助手实现的每一条动作，我都必须单独创建一条自动化。
工作原理
需要的工具：

一部旧手机/平板。
FV悬浮球APP（免费）  或者  通知滤盒APP（付费）
一台安装了Homeassistant的设备。（只要你会折腾甚至连Homeassistant也可以一同装在旧手机中）

执行步骤：

Homeassistant中预先创建自动化，触发条件设置为webhook
手机通过语音助手识别我的语音命令
根据我的语音命令创建一条通知
通过FV悬浮球的自动任务（或者通知滤盒）获取该通知
通过FV悬浮球的自动任务（或者通知滤盒）根据通知内容发送对应http请求到Homeassistant
Homeassistant收到发送的请求，并执行对应自动化。

如果你是用的是IOS设备，那只需要用Homeassistant安装Home Bridge 插件，就能接入 HomeKit用siri来控制智能家居了。另外IOS的捷径可以直接进行SSH连接安装了Homeassistant的设备执行shell命令。通过shell命令，不仅可以实现远程唤醒/关机之类的操作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[flomo 是新一代 「卡片笔记」 ，专注在碎片化时代，促进你的记录，帮你积累更多知识资产。
而作为一个功能，flomo 为用户提供了在微信侧的快速录入的能力。但受限于飞书的审核问题，flomo 一直没有提供飞书的接入，我们始终无法使用飞书来完成 flomo 的记录，接下来，我们一起动手自己写一个 flomo 机器人来完成类似微信的功能。
基本信息
本教程需要使用飞书账号、轻服务账号以及 flomo Pro 的权限，请先自行注册相应的账号。
获取 flomo API 地址
在飞书当中接入 Flomo，需要你已经开通 Flomo Pro，使用 Flomo Pro 提供的 API 来实现。因此，你需要访问 Flomo 的 「API 及第三方工具」页面，复制你的 API 链接，并留存下来，我们稍后会用到。
 
创建飞书机器人
首先，打开飞书开放平台，使用你的飞书账号登陆，点击首页的「创建应用」，进入到应用的创建页面，创建一个新的「企业自建应用」。

创建完成后，点击你创建好的 Flomo Pro 应用，进入应用详情，找到左侧菜单的「凭证与基础」，找到你的 App ID 和 App Secret，将这两个值记录下来，后续会用到。
此外，打开左侧菜单中的「事件订阅」，找到 Verification Token ，将这个值记录下来，后续会用到。

此外，你还需要点击左侧 Tab 中「应用功能」中的「机器人」页面，开启机器人功能。
创建轻服务应用
打开轻服务网站，登陆管理控制台

创建一个新的服务，这里需要选择 Node.js 应用来进行创建。创建完成后，进入到服务内部。
在服务内部点击左侧的「设置」，进入到设置页面，在设置页面中找到「小程序设置」，配置其中的「飞书小程序/机器人」，将刚刚保存的 App ID 、App Secret 填写到这里并保存。

编写代码，安装依赖，并上线函数
复制代码
打开代码页面，复制代码，并在你自己的云函数界面创建同名文件，粘贴对应的内容。

安装依赖
粘贴代码后，点击左下角 「NPM 管理」中输入框右侧的搜索按钮，在弹出的搜索框中输入 axios ，安装 axios 依赖。

配置环境变量
安装完成后,点击右上角配置框中的环境变量，填入VERIFICATION_TOKEN 和 FLOMO_API 以及对应的值：

VERIFICATION_TOKEN：飞书开放平台中，「事件订阅」tab 中的 Verification Token。
FLOMO_API：flomo 的 api ，可以从这里获取

上线函数
完成上述的代码配置、依赖安装以及环境变量配置后，接下来需要对函数进行上线操作。点击上方的函数上线按钮，即可将当前函数执行上线。
上线完成后，你会获得一个函数的调用地址，复制这个调用地址。

配置飞书机器人权限和 API 地址
配置 API 地址
完成了函数上线之后，接下来我们到飞书开放平台进行配置。
找到你刚刚创建的飞书应用，点击左侧边栏中的「事件订阅」，在事件订阅页面配置请求网址，在请求网址中粘贴刚刚复制的函数调用地址。

配置事件并申请权限
配置好请求网址 URL 后，点击下方的添加事件，在其中选择「接受消息 v2.0」

添加事件后，会自动提醒你需要申请相应的权限， 点击权限名称即可在弹出的窗口中申请权限。这里需要申请「读取用户发给机器人的单聊消息」和「获取用户在群聊中@机器人的消息」两个权限。
此外，你还需要在权限管理中申请「以应用的身份发消息」这个权限。
提交审核并发布机器人
完成各项配置后，点击左侧 Tab 中的「版本管理与发布」，并创建一个新的版本，填写各项基本信息。
需要注意的是，因为我们在这里没有添加鉴权的部分，所以需要设定可见权限为你自己，避免被其他人录入奇怪的信息。

完成填写后，「保存」并「申请发布」，等待审核通过后，你的机器人就可以在飞书当中使用啦～

在飞书上测试机器人
当你的飞书机器人发布成功后，接下来你就可以给 Flomo 机器人发消息了，比如，发个 #轻服务 Hi,你好，轻服务 试试看吧？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[24 小时自毁网站已经运行了近两年

2020 年 4 月，一个名为“这个网站会自毁”的网站悄悄上线了。它的自毁可以被网友们拯救：“你可以向我发送信息。如果 24 小时内我没有收到信息，将会永久自毁。”不过快两年过去了，它依然活着。这个网站上有各种各样的留言，你留言之后不但可以给这个网站续命，而且可以随机看到一条别人的留言。


老王点评：很有趣的一个社会实验，或许这个网站自毁的一天就是人类对自己已经失望的一天吧。




Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 计划坚守 Linux 内核 5.15

昨天我们发的 文章 中预测 Ubuntu 22.04 中可能会使用 Linux 内核 5.17。但是在关于 Ubuntu 22.04 的 GNOME 计划的讨论中，Canonical 提到 “计划是在 LTS 中使用 5.15，但是 OEM 和 HWE 版本将在某个时候升级到 5.17”。也就是说，在 2023 年，Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 将使用 Ubuntu 22.10 的 HWE 内核，而 Ubuntu 的 OEM 合作伙伴，如戴尔也能够为他们最新的 Linux 预装系统提供更新的内核。之所以采用 5.15，是因为这个版本也是 LTS 的，虽然已经发布了半年了。


老王点评：LTS 发行版采用 LTS 内核是应有之义，至于最新硬件支持，这个其实对于 LTS 版本来说并不是最关键的。




PCIe 6.0 规范发布，但 PCIe 4.0 才只有 10% 的份额

AMD 在 2019 年的锐龙 3000 系列处理器上首发了 PCIe 4.0 技术，现在各大 SSD 厂商也都有 PCIe 4.0 旗舰级硬盘上市。在 2020 年的时候，SATA SSD 硬盘份额超过了 1/3，PCIe 4.0 只占 3% 份额，2021 年才提高到了 10%，今年的普及速度还会加快，但份额预计只有 30% 左右。PCIe 5.0 硬盘的速度可从目前的 7GB/s 提升到 14GB/s，性能轻松翻倍。而 PCI-SIG 组织刚刚 发布 了 PCIe 6.0 标准，速度再次翻倍到 64GT/s，PCIe x16 可以提供高达 256GB/s 的带宽，用于 SSD 的话 PCIe 6.0 x4 可提供最高 32GB/s 的速度。


老王点评：硬件的发展真是日新月异，感觉没多久就淘汰了。]]></summary>

「2022 年什么会火？什么该学？本文正在参与“聊聊 2022 技术趋势”征文活动 」
什么是“好”的技术，为什么“火”
前言：这个是个人观点，技术要用在合适的业务场景中才能体现出它的优势，而不是盲目的去学，去看
解决现今开发的技术痛点
协程
回调地狱，切换线程等功能
a()//耗时任务

b()

当两个方法a，b执行的代码块没有依赖关系时，执行耗时任务采用异步的方式来解决，通过开线程或者通过handler post一个Runnable来执行a方法这个耗时操作，b不需要等待a结束就可以直接运行。
但是如果a和b是有依赖关系的，b方法需要用到a方法返回的数据进行处理，但是又为了不影响b之后的代码阻塞，所以会在a方法中传入一个回调，等到a方法执行完后回调接口，在回调方法里面在执行b方法
如果业务的依赖关系非常复杂，就会陷入到回调地狱中，这种方式一是不够优雅，二是代码不够直观（逻辑太过复杂）
相对来说：
协程在这方面比较“优雅”；切换线程也只需一行withContext（）;代码更加直观（森有体会，以前都是点到这然后点那，点的点的发现晕了，歇菜【自己进行时序图整理】）
插一句，这些功能并不是协程特有的，其他工具或者自己造轮子都可以实现。但是技术的功能性虽然很重要，但是其平台型和天然原生的api也是必不可少的（这部分后面在讲技术生态的时候讨论）。
插件化
这项技术虽然已经不怎么“新”了，大家也都知道了它的优势和解决的痛点：
1.动态更新app
(是整个APP都更新，不是热修复那种补丁包单独修改某个问题。实现方法目前是云端存放最新的插件apk，每次进行检测版本号等观察是否需要更新，当然保证apk的安全性也是必要的，可通过一些加密解密来保证)
2.减少包体积

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

板绘新手大部分是看了动漫，或看到哪位大大画的成品图，因为想学而了解到的数位板、数位屏。那么，什么是数位板？如何选择一款适合自己的数位板？数位板和数位屏选哪个好？诸多问题常常让新手不知所措。这篇文章，我将为板绘初学者答疑解惑。
初识数位板
数位板，又名绘图板、绘画板、手绘板、手写板等，是连接电脑、手机、平板的一种输入设备，由一块板子、一支有压感的笔和一根线组成，主要用于数字绘画、写字、标注等。我们常在网络上看到的插画、漫画、动漫等，就是艺术家使用数位板或其它设备绘画而出。

最重要的先说完：两个最直接的感官体验
尺寸方面，需要根据自己的书桌/电脑桌子的大小，以及自己手的大小来选择适合自己的数位板。
手感方面，数位板表面的画感，就是那层「膜」——有粗有细，喜欢素描纸的那种粗糙感，可以买粗一点，但粗糙的同时，笔芯也磨损的快。相反，喜欢铜版纸的那种光滑感，可以买细点，笔芯也相对画的久些。再者就是笔的手感，有软笔和硬笔之分，习惯画水彩或者平时画画或写字都不喜欢使劲的，建议买软笔手感，行程长，笔的压感容易得到释放。如果平时写字画画都比较用力，建议买硬笔，行程短，不容易压坏笔的同时，手感也更舒适。

解读数位板详细参数
读取速率
读取速率也叫读取速度（单位：英文 PPS，中文是点/秒），目前常见的有 133、200、233、266、300 这几个配置可选，一般越高越好，这个参数影响到你画线跟不跟笔，一般 200 以上肉眼就很难看出有延迟情况，但也要看电脑的配置，配置不好，数位板的读取速率在高，也还是会延迟。（目前达到 300PPS 的数位板是绘…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在你学习 Linux 命令行或练习新的编程语言时，请随身携带这些方便的备忘单。




你不可能记住每一个你需要使用的命令或快捷方式。我们都是普通人，通常情况下，我把笔记放在不同的纸片上和笔记本里。这导致我的办公桌上有些过分紊乱。到处都是一些五年前的杂乱无章的潦草文字。这这些 2021 年的备忘单将把混乱降低一个档次。从 JavaScript 到 Linux，这个列表中都有适合你的东西。

如何编写你的第一段 JavaScript 代码

这篇 文章 是为那些今年想尝试学习一门新语言的初来乍到者准备的。Seth Kenlon 介绍了如何安装 JavaScript 和开始制作一个简单的 HTML 页面。虽然 Seth 解释说 JavaScript 并不只用于网站，但所有主要的网页浏览器都有一个运行你的代码的 JavaScript 引擎。在整个演练过程中，Seth 涵盖了语法、变量和函数，让你开始创建一个新的应用。最后，在分享 备忘录 之前，Seth 还介绍了用 JavaScript 进行跨平台的能力。

Linux 软件包管理

在 Chris Hermanse 的 文章 中，在他分享他的 备忘录 之前，我们对使用 apt 做了简要预览。许多人日常在家里和办公室使用基于 Debian 的 Linux。在这篇入门文章中，我们可以了解一下 apt 的用途，首先是用 apt 在软件包系统中寻找软件，也可以用另一个命令查看这些软件包的元数据。接下来，Chris 介绍了查看一个软件包是否包括安装过程中需要的文件（软件包依赖）。最后，Chris 介绍了如何用 apt 命令删除软件包。这份详尽的备忘录可以给你带来比 Linux 的日常软件包管理更多的东西。如果 apt 不适合你，你也可以看看 dnf 备忘录。

用 DOS conio 开始编程

你是否想在明年涉足 DOS？如果是的话，你已经准备好创建令人兴奋的新应用，Jim Hall 为你准备了一份 备忘录。在这篇 文章 中定义了 conio，在分享备忘录之前，Jim 介绍了如何制作你自己的彩色文本用户界面。Jim 解释说，你可以用你的应用做更多的事情，使其更具互动性和刺激性。现在你有了这个备忘录，你就可以用 DOS conio 创建你自己的应用了。

学习 SQLite3

与这种常见的数据库一起工作？下面是你如何通过这个 备忘录 成为一个资深用户。在这个 实践教程 中，Klaatu 从安装和与 SQLite3 互动开始，然后在分享备忘录之前创建了一个带表的数据库。Klaatu 还用一段很简单的文字解释了数据类型和日期时间戳功能。Klaatu 在本教程中增加了更多详细的功能，包括查看表格、改变表格等等。如果你想继续使用 SQLite3 数据库并使其变得强大，或者只是想学习如何使用它，这个备忘录就适合你。

更多的 Linux 备忘录

虽然我只是蜻蜓点水地提及了这些备忘单，但我想提到一些值得称赞的地方，其中包括 Seth Kenlon 的 Linux 备忘单：


Seth 对 grep 的高级用法对各种场合都很有用。

find 命令备忘录对于我不想花大量时间在目录中徘徊的时候特别有帮助。

wget 备忘录对于那些你需要从互联网上获取东西的时候是很方便的。


以回顾 2021 年开始 2022 年

2021 年是备忘录的辉煌之年，其中许多是关于 Linux 的，但也有一些备忘录甚至让你从一种全新的语言开始。我强烈建议你打印出这些备忘录，在 2022 年开始学习新东西。我们欢迎各种经验水平的作者，请通过 给我们发送文章或备忘录 告诉我们你是如何学习新技能的。

出于行业视野的局限，能写长文的话题少的不行；干的不是财务所以年前没活儿（不是），只能不断地在一亩三分地挖坑。作者喜闻乐见的两个话题，艺术和教育，一个源于生活，高于生活1，另一个干脆就是生活2，四舍五入少数派生活区得有我一把椅子。
近期为了朋友的婚礼，准备了一场相当用心的演出（也就是封面），得到的反馈是“和平时认为的魔术表演不太一样”。所以原本想写的其实是关于教育的文章，但趁着还有灵感，抓紧写（水）一篇稿子。
哦对，我依旧是老麦的颜粉，咱们开始：

一、雅俗共赏的艺术创作 —— 不只是 “脱了裤子唱昆曲”
郭老师认为真正的艺术就是雅俗共赏，这个答案靠谱。回想刘谦老师09年春晚的演出，靠的也是橡皮筋儿、鸡蛋、戒指和董卿老师（没有）成功地出圈，而这些与生活息息相关的魔术物件，其实很大程度上把魔术变得合理3，从而成就了 “令人印象深刻的魔术”。

“雅要雅得那么俗，俗要俗的那么雅。” —— 郭德纲

这就如吾独钟爱王建国老师的段子，尽管大家都记住了活该扣钱的、残pè的谐音梗，但让人记忆深刻的还是一些有深度的内容；有些不需要动脑子也能大笑出声的 “俗套” 段子，更有的是许多值得一些个，所谓“风雅”之士玩味的好东西。
如题
或许所谓雅俗共赏，“俗” 一字所探讨的不是外生殖器或者固液气三态排泄物这种等级的“三俗”，而是关于艺术创作引起观众共鸣的门槛，到底有多高，或者说金色大厅的演出，究竟有没有街边两条狗打架好看？这个门槛之于电影、音乐、美术而言非常清晰，尤其是如今短平快，流量为王的时代，你的观点或创作简单易懂的程度，作者认为正是其中一个门槛。
著名弹幕网站对于《让子弹飞》申遗的事儿，想必关注互联网的人都明白，作者认为这部电影 “俗” 到头了。看这部片子不需要所谓知识储备和艺术底蕴，平铺直叙的段子（如：来者不善，你才是来者）笑得我这个没什么文化的人把大腿拍烂，讲茶…]]></summary>

在软件市场，拥有很多各具特色的编辑器。在最近两年，随着 Notion 和 Roam Research 等工具的发展，原本已经拥挤的笔记软件赛道又出现了不少新的笔记软件。
与笔记软件相比，写作软件相对来说少很多。尽管如此，写作软件市场已经不少拥有特色的写作工具。今天，我尝试在有限的视野范围内对已发现的一些拥有特色的写作软件进行逐一盘点。
在正文开始之前，有几点需要说明：

文章中出现的写作软件，只是作为某个类别的写作软件代表进行介绍。具体使用体验，最好还是请用户自行判断。
文章中选择的写作软件具有一定的主观性，同时也存在挂一漏万的情形。有不足之处，请留言补充。
理论上，对于一款编辑器而言，既可以记笔记，也可以进行创作。但是，笔记记录和内容创作等使用场景对于编辑器的需求并不一样。因此，对于一些没有自我定位为写作软件的编辑器，并不在筛选范围内。所以，对于编辑体验很棒的 Typora 等 Markdown 编辑器不会加以罗列。同理，尽管 Roam Research、Obsidian 等双链笔记其实非常适合作为写作软件，本文也不会涉及。

干扰？诱惑？那些聚焦写作任务的写作软件
早期的写作软件，主要是从优化写作体验的角度出发为写作提供辅助。比如，支持 Markdown 语法进行输入，这如今成为绝大多数写作软件的标准配置。在 Markdown 编辑的基础上，逐渐衍生出一些辅助用户聚焦写作任务的功能。
无干扰模式
无干扰模式的早期代表为 iA Writer ，主要是在干净、清爽的写作环境基础上，以降低上下文干扰为目的的内容聚焦功能。 随后，Ulysses 强化了无干扰模式，支持以段落、行、句子为单位的多种形式的内容聚焦，并且辅以页面自动滚动功能。
这些无干扰模式本质上是通过对当前编辑内容的上下文进行淡化隐藏加以实现。尽管如此，这些上下文对于某些创作者而言依然是…]]></summary>

Yup, you heard that right. You no longer need to create your own CSS. This will save you plenty of development time, so you can focus on other parts of your project. 
To begin, create a new folder on your desktop and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
If you have Visual Studio Code, pull up the terminal. 

Then type in npm -v. This command is necessary to see which version of npm you are running. If you don't have it installed, you'll have an error message. If you didn't download npm, don't worry. It's pretty easy, just search for it on Google.
Now go ahead and also install node.js. To make sure it's there, run npm -v again in the terminal. If…]]></summary>

We as a developer use these Events to manipulate things in the site.
In the Case of React Events, they  are not actually the DOM Events they are called Synthetic Events.
Synthetic Events → These are the Wrappers that React uses to standardise event functionality across browser.
But what is the need of Synthetic Events ??
Actually Events are not the part of Core JavaScript , they come from each browser’s JavaScript API , means Each browser will handle them differently.
So in React we have the Synthetic Events which makes the consistency across all the browser.

So let's create a better Thue! I made an episode about Thue(https://dev.to/taw/100-languages-speedrun-episode-43-thue-143i), so read that for some background.
Thue is a fun esoteric language, but suffers from two annoying issues:
newline handling requires special weird rules
a lot of nearly identical rules needed to be copied and pasted as there are no wildcard matches
I'll be using Crystal to code the interpreter(https://taw.hashnode.dev/100-languages-speedrun-episode-49-crystal).
Before I start adding new features, let's write a base interpreter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that JS is a single-threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language.
But what does this actually mean?
Let’s find out: 
Suppose we have a function that calls another function that calls one more function, such as:
function add(a,b) {
    return a+b;
}
function callAdd(a,b) {
    return add(a,b);
}
function finalFunc(a,b) {
    const addDigits = callAdd(a,b)
    console.log(addDigits);
}
finalFunc(3,4); // Output: 7

We all know that finalFunc will call callAdd, callAdd will call add, and add will return the sum of these two numbers and we will get 7. 
But what’s happening behind the scenes?

So, there is a thing called call stack in JavaScript which is a type of data structure that records basically where we are currently in our program. 
It looks something like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a web developer for a long time, and one concept that always comes up is turning HTML into a PDF. It's a pretty natural request; HTML is a nice display oriented format and has great layout and styling abilities. Plus, for a web app, I probably already have code written to produce the exact content I want. I just need to turn that content into a read-only, portable PDF for downloading or attaching to an email, without forcing the user to print to pdf manually.
I've used numerous technologies for doing that conversion, including WebSuperGoo's ABCpdf.net, and Rotativa's free library. (We even have an article on how to use it.) The latter is still in use on some of my projects, but it—and its newer .Net Core version—is based on wkhtmltopdf.exe, which is a problem. More about that lat…]]></summary>

The short of PageSpeed is that if you add it to your web server, you can configure it to optimize anything passing through it using techniques such as minification, format conversion, and even injecting scripts to lazy-load images. You can read more about what it does on the official site.
It sounded great in theory, but how properly install it with NGINX wasn't obvious. While Google does publish scripts to help with the installation, it requires a non-trivial depth of knowledge to do right. After struggling with it for many hours, I wrote a guide for personal future reference.

All the while, threat actors are continually improving their attack techniques. If there is a vulnerability to be found, it will be exploited. This is why many teams are shifting security to the left, even going as far as evolving their development methodology from DevOps to DevSecOps.
Developers still have remaining concerns, most of which focus on release time. However, you should not need to compromise fast releases in favor of security.
In this article, you will learn about four methods that can enable you to secure your Vue apps quickly. These are simple security practices that should not interrupt your workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I've built a recipe sharing app using Django rest framework and React.js. This application has taught me a lot and wanted to share it with you guys.
Django, Django rest framework
React.js, Redux, TailwindCSS
JWT based user registration and login.
CRUD endpoints for recipes.
Like and bookmark feature.
Unit testing on the backend.
Documentation of the API using drf_spectacular which supports OAS3.
=> There are some things to be fixed on the frontend and other features will be added soon.




The frontend and backend are hosted separately on Netlify and Heroku respectively. 
https://mesob-recipe.netlify.app/
You can test the endpoints here: https://recipe-backend-api.herokuapp.com/
If you like the project, give it a star on GitHub.
Link to GitHub repo: 
Backend: https://github.com/earthcomfy/recipe-api


Frontend: https://github.com/earthcomfy/react-recipe-app



Note: If you guys would like to see a tutorial on how some of the features are done, especially on the integration of Django and React, let me know in the comments section down below. I'll make sure to write a detailed article about the topic.
Any suggestions and feedbacks are welcome. 
Thanks for your time.]]></summary>

如果我想用一个笔记本同时丝滑拖动两个 4k 屏，正常办公的情景下，是不是需要上最新款的 14 寸 mbp ，或者带独显直连的 win 本（比如 3060 幻 14 ）是否可以满足我的需要？

内容管理系统Content Management System（CMS）是一个多产的软件类别，其涵盖了所有创建和修改数字内容的应用程序。因此，CMS 的历史可以追溯到由 蒂姆-伯纳斯-李 在 1990 年建立的历史上的第一个网站也就不足为奇了，该网站是以基于互联网的超文本系统 HTML 为模型，只包含了文本和链接。



万维网（WWW）的雏形是静态网站，无需后端数据库即可提供内容。它们消耗的计算资源很少，所以加载速度很快 —— 因为没有数据库查询、没有模板渲染、也没有客户端-服务器请求的处理。鉴于那时很少有人经常“上网冲浪”，特别是与今天相比，Web 流量也很少。

当然，促进了这种互操作性都是开源软件。事实上，开源在 CMS 的演变中一直扮演着重要的角色。

CMS 的崛起

快进到九十年代中期，随着万维网的普及和网站对频繁更新的需求的增加 —— 这与它最初托管手册式的静态内容有所不同。这导致了大量的 CMS 产品的出现，如 FileNet、Vignette 的StoryBuilder、Documentum 和其他许多产品。这些都是专有的闭源产品，这在那个时期并不罕见。

然而，在 21 世纪初，开源的 CMS 替代品出现了，这包括 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla。WordPress 包含一个可扩展的插件架构，并提供了可用于建立网站的模板，而不要求用户具备 HTML 和 CSS 知识。WordPress CMS 软件安装在 Web 服务器上，通常与 MySQL 或 MariaDB 数据库（当然，两者都是开源的）配合。CMS 是开源的这一事实在一定程度上加速了向 WordPress 的重大转变。

即使在今天，仍有大约三分之一的网站是使用这些第一代内容…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[kkkkkkz: 1 发生：记得是初一，我就感觉到身边的一切都不真实了，感觉是脑子蒙上了一层纱，但是不影响正常生活和学习，但是这种感觉超级不爽
这种感觉一直是持续性的，只有在初一某一天早上刷牙的时候，突然清醒了，但是大概两分钟后，又恢复到了不真实状态，一直持续到现在（ 28 岁），从来没有清醒过
2 治疗：刚得到这种不真实感后，就跟不爽，就和爸妈吵闹，但是他们也不懂，看了镇上的医生，说身体没问题
后来爸妈请教了一些先生，搞了个土办法，让我吃了一只鸡，不放盐直接蒸熟，然后吃完，骨头放在老家的地里埋了，就完事。我全力配合，我不想继续被这种感觉笼罩，可是无济于事。
后来我继续说我很难受，我可能有病，家里就带我去了南京军区总医院（老爸当兵的时候去过），抽了血，查了脑电图，说啥都正常呀，我不知道是高兴还是难过，爸妈反正是高兴了
很多个夜里翻来覆去，想想自己能不能醒过来，还是受不了，也不想和爸妈说了，他们也尽力了
算了吧，就当这玩意儿是个朋友，没办法，既来之则安之，我不去想就是了，不把注意力放在当下我是不真实的这种感受上，如果一出生人就是这种感觉呢，我可能初一之前是非常心如明镜的感觉，超乎常人吧，初一后回归了而已，别放在心上了… 想方设法安慰自己，不然，不知道怎么过去
3 现在：就这样，十几年过去了，正常上大学，工作，有 2 次恋爱，见了家长，最后还是分手了… 就常人看来，我就是个正常人，没有啥不同的
没有人知道这个不真实感是什么，查了下资料，像是现实解体 /人格解体，但是这个可能是创伤导致，想了下我好像啥创伤也没有啊，解体会带来不真实感，但是解体的原因和其他症状，我好像都没有，只有一个不真实感
我一直认为这个问题还是生理问题，甚至上周去拔智齿，还想着会不会是智齿把神经搞不真实了，拔完了还是一样
有想过看心理医生，但是除了不真实感，没有其他心理创伤或者心结了，有车有房有工作，平平安安没有遇到特别不顺的事，有一点躺平，所以也没去看心理医生了
PS：不管有没有不真实感，做梦的时候，梦里的感觉都是一样的~ （苦笑）]]></summary>

每天的生活就是工作啊工作。做不完的工作。发完这篇估计又要睡觉了。
今天中午约了人事吃饭。又自告奋勇的跟她说爬山的事，说的眉飞色舞。不过也确实是今年最值得开心的事。事情大概上一篇的视频已经说了。这次补充一点的是，至今仍然回味无穷。贴几张邂逅的那个她的照片。

在过去的数个月里，我开始高强度使用妙记来改善日常的学习生活。
我过去三个月的使用情况
妙记的使用场景？
现场直播 - 2021 秋季飞书未来无限大会: https://zhanglixing.feishu.cn/minutes/obcniz2wa167643bt6u541ym
以发布会的妙记为例
会议场景
妙记作为飞书这样一个企业级协作平台的子应用，主打的其实就是高效会议回顾。
开会时打开妙记，会后妙记会自动帮你完成音频转文字、识别不同的说话人，你还可以插入书签(也就是所谓的议程、结论)方便其他人快速跳转，关联材料链接让其他人更好地获取会议背景信息。
编辑好的妙记可以通过链接可以直接分享给未参会的同学，支持倍速、点赞、搜索、跳过空白片段，也支持评论和互动。
所有妙记文件还支持播客模式，通勤路上也可以听。
课程场景
不得不承认，现在以视频形式承载的课程越来越多。在阮一峰老师的历史文章里曾提到过人们喜欢视频学习的原因在于

人类学习效率最高的方式，不是"读书 + 思考"，而是"观察 + 模仿"。前者需要较长时间的注意力投入，后者只需要短时间注意力，更符合人类的天性。

昨天有推荐 Vivaldi 浏览器，我试用了下感觉挺不错的，但是自带的翻译一直不能用。

用云服务器 ping 了下mimir.vivaldi.com，也全部超时，用 google 找的在线 ping 的网站查也超时。
在 Vivaldi 的官方论坛反馈了下，也一直没有人理我(整得我好尴尬，觉得是不是我问的姿势不对)。
想问下使用过这个功能的坛友，是不是真的崩了。持续多久了。有没有官方的回复什么时候能用(Google 搜索关键词几乎没有)

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/828332"/>
        <updated>2022-01-14T13:23:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[vtoex0000000002: 
RT ，
单臂路由 ：pppoe 拨号，dns ， 网关 ，地址 192.168.1.2
主路由: 提供 wifi ，地址 192.168.1.1
该模式下，重启 wan 口或重启单臂路由，导致 client 获取多个 v6 ，从而导致不能联网问题。
调试一天后，没找到解决办法。
昨晚，想能不能用旁路路由实现？
将 pppoe 拨号放到主路由上，其他不变。注意：单臂路由 lan 口配置网关 192.168.1.1 ，否则单臂路由无法联网。（再配置 lan6 ，dncpv6 client 获取 v6 ，做不做无所谓，如果单臂路由不需要 v6 地址）。
网络拓扑比较简单：
光猫-->lan 口-->n1 盒子
主路由：我用的是 hs8145x6 的光猫，直接用光猫的千兆网卡和 wifi 做主路由。
单臂路由 n1 ，刷 op ，network 如下：
config interface 'lan'
        option proto 'static'
        option netmask '255.255.255.0'
        option device 'eth0'
        option ip6ifaceid 'random'
        option ip6assign '64'
        option ipaddr '192.168.1.2'
        option gateway '192.168.1.1'

config device
        option name 'eth0'
        option mtu '1500'
        option mtu6 '1500'

config device
        option name 'vpn-client'

config interface 'lan6'
        option proto 'dhcpv6'
        option reqaddress 'try'
        option reqprefix 'auto'
        option device 'eth0'
        option ip6assign '64'
        option ip6ifaceid 'random'
        option peerdns '0'

dhcp

config dhcp 'lan'
        option interface 'lan'
        option ra_management '1'
        option start '100'
        option limit '150'
        option force '1'
        option leasetime '1d'
        list ra_flags 'none'

这样，v6 地址的获取是从主路由获取，v4 从单臂路由获取。
单臂路由和主路由负载均衡分布，有利于提升设备利用率，提升上网速率。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[广告过滤 DNS 服务 Adhole 宣布关停

Pi-hole 可以帮助用户过滤浏览器和流媒体服务中的广告，可被设置于 DNS 的前方。早在 2017 年，Adhole 从一个公共 VPS 上的小型单节点 Pi-hole 实例，发展成为一个全球性的多节点广告屏蔽 DNS 网络，在全球拥有了成千上万的并发用户。但这也导致需要更多的服务器资源和维护工作。并且，最近还因为 IP 地址变换和证书更换带来了稳定性问题。不堪重负之下，项目方 宣布关闭。


老王点评：这就是公益行为没有转换成可持续的非营利模式。有些可惜。




去年可利用的 WordPress 插件漏洞数量爆炸性增长

研究人员 发现，到 2021 年底，第三方 WordPress 插件中有 10359 个漏洞，其中 2240 个漏洞是在去年披露的，与 2020 年相比，漏洞数量增加了 142%。WordPress 插件的漏洞中，有 75% 可被远程利用，80% 存在公开利用，而可公开利用的漏洞中 60% 没有被 CVE 组织记录。平均而言，所有 WordPress 插件漏洞的 CVSSv2 得分是 5.5，属于中等风险。但研究发现，恶意行为者并不青睐那些严重性高的漏洞，而是选择那些他们容易利用的漏洞。


老王点评：超过 40% 网站使用 WordPress，因而其缺陷和风险也被相应放大，值得注意。




Linux 内核准备彻底移除 a.out 格式支持

直到 90 年代中期的 Linux 1.2 版本之前，Linux 都依靠 a.out 二进制文件格式，之后才改用了 ELF 二进制文件格式。但直到 2019 年，Linux 才废除了对在 x86 32 位上运行 a.out 的支持。现在，有人提交 了从内核中移除 a.out 支持的补丁，并得到了其它内核开发者的支持。在这个过程中，一些旧的系统调用和其他未使用的内核代码也有可能被清理掉。这可能在 5.17 或 5.18 进入内核主线。


老王点评：虽然不移除也不伤大雅，但是这种过时的遗留物还是清理了好。可喜的看到，Linux 内核现在正在做各种清理工作。]]></summary>

堕落于日常的欲望，是不是真的就可以逃避现实呢？

@潘誉晗：之前的《亢奋 特别篇》显然没有满足粉丝的「胃口」，第二季一上线就打破了 HBO 流媒体成立以来的收视记录，首播当天更是由于过于火爆而造成平台系统的短暂崩溃。

比起其他兼具大尺度和话题度的青春剧，这部剧无疑更盛。酒精、毒药、性爱、跨性别等在剧中被多次提及只是小意思而已，更神奇的是，即使这部剧在美国因尺度过大而被投诉，可我们还是会被剧中的人物和故事所感动，因为我们知道，剧…]]></summary>

如果你关注社交网络，应该对最近密集出现的这样一种推文不陌生：主体内容只有红、绿、灰三色的 emoji 方块，再配上或兴奋或懊恼的寥寥数语。

不用担心，这不是什么邪教密码，也不是什么外星文字。其实，这只是个网页游戏 Wordle 的「每日战绩」。

不少读者可能对这个界面有点眼熟——看着挺像「填字游戏」（Crossword）。没错，从分类上看，Wordle 和填字游戏都属于字谜游戏的一种。在英语国家，字谜游戏有悠久的历史和广泛的受众，变化也很多样，填字游戏则是其中最具代表性的。

相比之下，Wordle 似乎在难度和形态上都大大简化：这个游戏每天更新一期，玩家唯一目标，就是在六次尝试机会之内，猜出一个五个字母的单词。
为此，游戏界面是一个 5×6 的方块阵列。玩家通过下方键盘输入猜测结果后，游戏会给字母方块标上颜色，提示猜测的准确性：

绿色 🟩：说明答案里有这个字母、所在位置也正确；
黄色 🟨：说明答案里有这个字母、但不在这个位置；
灰色 ⬜：说明答案里没有这个字母。

然后，玩家根据获得的提示继续尝试，直到猜对答案，或者用尽六次机会。
游戏结束后，会给玩家提供一份统计数据，显示各步骤的正确率、连续游玩的天数和下一局上线的倒计时；同时，会将玩家的游戏界面生成对应颜色布局的 emoji 矩阵，点击「share」按钮即可复制分享——这也就是文章开头那种密电一般推文的来源。
带你玩一局
规则说起来容易，但是为了让大家有更直观的印象，我们以 1 月 12 日的谜题为例，看一看实际玩起来到底是怎样的。

游戏开局，面对一张白纸，只能靠瞎猜。我的运气不错，随手打的「MOMMY」就命中了一个字母 O，只是所在位置不正确（黄色）。
于是，我换了一个也含有 O，但所在位置不同的「OTHER」继续试探。O 的位置仍然不对，但好在知道了字母 R 是我们需要的，并…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[借助开源的力量，任何人都可以编程。找到一个你想做的项目，并让它成为你进入编程的第一个项目。




任何人都可以开始学习编程。我们都是从某个起点开始的，而且你不需要有计算机科学背景就可以学习编程。这就是 Linux 和开源的力量：任何人都可以学习一点编程。

如果你想学习一种新的编程语言，我们有几篇可以让你起步的很棒的文章。下面是我们最受欢迎的几篇文章，它们可以帮助到你。

比较编程语言

大多数编程语言都有某些相似之处。当你知道如何用一种编程语言做一件事，学习下一种编程语言主要是弄清其语法和结构。

不同的编程语言如何做同样的事情

学习一种新的编程语言的一个好方法是写一个简单的测试程序，如一个游戏，以探索该编程语言的工作原理。我经常写的一个示例程序是一个简单的“猜数字”游戏，即计算机在 1 到 100 之间挑选一个数字，让我猜出来。今年早些时候，我们发表了 一系列文章，探讨如何用几种编程语言编写猜数字游戏。了解这些不同的编程语言如何实现“猜数字”游戏的主要步骤。

不同的编程语言如何读写数据

Alan 的文章比较了不同的编程语言如何在相同的思想下 读写数据。无论这些数据是来自于配置文件还是用户创建的文件，在存储设备上处理数据对于编码者来说是很常见的。Alan 的比较文章提供了对几种流行的编程语言，如 C、Java、Groovy 和其他语言所采取的不同方法的深入了解。

学习一种新的编程语言

无论你是想学习一种新的编程语言，还是想探索一种现有的编程语言，请看看下面这些关于学习编程的好文章。

如何用 WebAssembly 编写 “Hello World”

WebAssembly 是一种字节码格式，几乎所有的浏览器都可以将其编译为主机系统的机器代码。与 JavaScript 和 WebGL 一起，WebAssembly 满足了将应用移植到网络浏览器中独立使用的需求。Stephan 解释了如何用 WASM-text 创建经典的 Hello World 程序。

用 Golang 轻松实现交叉编译

Gaurav 写了关于通过将脚本转换为 Go 程序来学习 Go 的交叉编译支持。你可以一次写好你的程序，并通过交叉编译为另一个环境进行编译。

为什么我使用 D 编程语言来编写脚本

D 编程语言由于其静态类型和元编程能力，常常被认为是一种系统编程语言。然而，它也是一种非常高效的脚本语言。Lawrence 写了关于如何利用 D 编程语言进行 普通的脚本编写。

借助于开源的力量，编程可以被任何人所接受。找到一个你想做的项目，并让它成为你进入编程的第一个项目。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你是一位少数派的老读者，那么你肯定对每次 Apple 发布会后的「少数派一图流」不陌生。此外，你肯定还在不少地方看过一些写满了文字的长图，在这之中不乏精美的排版，阅读的感受甚至优于一些活动性的网页。那么，这些好看的长文图片，要怎样才能制作出来？
来自某位不愿透露姓名的编辑
软件生成
如果你只是单纯需要制作一张长文图片，那么不少写作 App 中自带的导出为图片功能基本上就能满足了，例如桌面端的 Typora、Bear 和 Markdown，移动端的锤子便签、Zine 等等。我们只需要在 App 中直接撰写对应的内容，在导出时选择图片格式即可。
一般而言，上述这些 App 生成的图片效果都还不错，有些 App 还提供了自定义样式选择。而有些 App（例如 Typora）甚至还支持通过 CSS 完全自定义排版，可以说非常专业了。
Markdown 提供的导出为长图功能
不过，这些软件虽然提供了导出为长文图片的功能，但在很多时候可能却不尽如人意。例如，你没办法去控制字体的大小、行间距，以及字体、图片宽度、图片分辨率和精细度等等。即使可以，很多也都需要通过 Typora 这样，需要在 CSS 中进行调整，门槛较高且不够灵活。
除此之外，一些更有设计感的长文图片，这些 App 也都是无能为力的。所以如果你有更高阶的需求，那么不妨继续往下看。
自行排版
App 代劳的方式束缚太多，那么为什么我们不直接来排版呢？通过更加专业的排版设计软件，制作出一个完全符合我们预期的效果，其实并没有这么难。
别急着砍柴，先磨刀
如果要对图片中的每一个细节进行自定义，那么先不要急着打开电脑。首先先问自己：自己的审美大概在哪个水平？如果你觉得自己做出来的效果并不比 App 自动生成的更好看，或者你不太清楚自己到底要什么样的长文图片，那么我建议你先好好想想这个问题，不然做出来的效果可能并不能满足你的预期。

还有店员疯狂在推荐 5G 金，说他们的专利，结果每家店都有。
1 、先老凤祥看好了一对金挂坠，5G 金，一口价，都准备付钱了。媳妇随口问了句这个多重。但是柜员就不直说，说是质保单有，还疯狂给我说这个是 999 足金，以后不喜欢可以按现在标牌价换新（实际付款价格为标价的 9 折）。又问了一次，柜员还是重复前面的话，就是不正面回答。我听着不对劲，赶紧拉着媳妇跑了。
2 、后面又在六福珠宝看了另外一款，按 485 每克计价，额外每克收 22 的加工费。柜员还很热情给我说，最近有个活动，可以每克少 40 块。但是付钱要直接扫到她私人微信号，而不是走商场统一的支付。后面想了想还是不敢买。]]></summary>

热修复技术，将补丁上传到云端，app可以直接从云端下来补丁直接应用；
热修复技术对于国内开发者来说是一个比较实用的功能，可以解决如下问题：
发布新版本代价较大，用户下载安装成本高；
版本更新的效率问题，需要较长时间来完成版本覆盖；
版本更新的升级率问题，不升级版本的用户得不到修复，强更又比较暴力。
小而重要的功能，需要短时间内完成版本覆盖，比如节日活动。
热修复的优势：无需发版，用户无感知，修复成功率高，用时短；
百家争鸣的热修复框架
手淘的Dexposed: 开源，底层替换方案, 基于Xposed，针对Dalvik运行时的Java Method Hook技术，但对于Dalvik底层过于依赖，无法继续兼容Android5.0之后的ART，因此作罢；
支付宝的Andfix：开源，底层替换方案，借助Dexposed思想，做到了Dalvik和ART环境的全版本兼容，但其底层固定结构的替换方案稳定性不好，使用范围也存在着诸多限制，而且对于资源和so修复未能实现，详细原理参考：Android热修复框架AndFix原理解析及使用；
阿里百川的Hotfix：开源，底层替换方案，依赖于Andfix并对业务逻辑解耦，安全性和易用性较好，但还是存在Andfix的缺点；
Qzone超级补丁: 未开源，类加载方案，会侵入打包流程
美团的Robust：开源，Instant Run方案，详细可以参考美团技术团队的文章及Robust源码：Android热更新方案Robust, Android热更新方案Robust开源，新增自动化补丁工具

SMSL SP200 ($140)
JDS Labs ATOM AMP+ ($99)
目前比较倾向的选择是 SP200 和 ATOM ，但是根据这个评测 jds-atom-amp-review以及各种评测来看，貌似 atom+比 sp200 还强，性价比确实高。

这段时间因为疫情在家隔离，闲来无事就想起之前一直想要给 Flask 做一个可以热更新代码的插件系统，于是花了一周左右的时间研读了一遍 Flask 的源代码，并写了一个 Flask 扩展：Flask-Plugin 。
现阶段，使用它你可以：
与 Application 、Blueprint 相同的方式定义插件路由，同时提供所有的 Flask 功能（模板渲染、URL 构造、消息闪现、信号等等）
每个插件都可以在 Flask 运行时 启动、停止、重载。
与 Flask 一同配置，无需加载单独的配置文件。
插件自动发现与管理。
项目的文档还在编写中，同时我也在示例文件夹（ example ）中添加了两个简单的小项目，其中一个是移植自 flaskex 项目，而将这个原生 Flask 项目移植为插件仅仅改动了少量代码。
感兴趣的朋友可以前往项目地址： https://github.com/guiqiqi/flask-plugin
欢迎大家试用、反馈 Bug 、提交 PR 、点个 Star 🌟！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OPENAXT: 首先，这是我参与砍价的一款手机产品，大家可以看到我的进度是免费拿仅差百分之 00.9 ，进度条右侧停留在 99.1%，实际上从我领取了第一个 0.01 元后开始，到我砍掉许多 0.01 后，页面就一直保持这样没有发生过变化。我在砍价的时候一直很难理解，为什么百分比没变化。
在案件审理过程中，拼多多终于为我解答了疑惑，大家看看他们是怎么说的：
他们说因页面显示百分比位数有限，所以他们把一个至少小数点后有 6 位数以上的百分比，直接省略显示为 0.9%，原来我的 0.9%不是 0.9%，而是 0.9996427%，在这一刻，我感觉我前 30 年的数学都白学了，我的人生需要重新定义一下 0.9%。
我们的法庭问对方为什么不在页面显示完整百分比，他们说显示屏有限，而且这个数是除不尽的所以贴心的为大家做了省略，我听到这里只觉得好笑，你都可以在 0.9 前面加一个 0 ，写成 00.9 了，却不把 0.9 后面哪怕一个小数点写出来，这是为什么呢？也许也是贴心的考虑到我们玩砍价免费拿的玩家，数学比较差，都不会计算小数点后 2 位的加减法吧。
另外，100-99.1 只能等于 0.9 整，对方说 0.9 后面有小数点，那么为什么在我的进度条会显示 99.1 呢，难道他们又要给我重新定义 99.1 的概念吗？在这里呢，对方说这个是什么程序上的显示法，99 后面只要有数，他们就进位显示成 99.1 ，而且进度只有 100 ，他们不可能显示加起来超过 100 ，他们这可不是欺骗哦，朋友们，大家说说看，在进度条只有 100 的情况下，哪一种程序上的算法可以让 100-99.1 所得的 0.9 后面有至少 6 位数小数点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have developed a small social network web app for educational purpose and want to share this with the community. This app is built with ReactJS for frontend, Java Spring Boot for backend and MongoDB as the database.
The app tries to mimic a few functions of Twitter, including:
Create post with text and image
The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters
Like, comment and re-post a post
View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post
Comments are toggle
The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters
Follow, un-follow someone
See who are following us and follow them back
Check who we are following
View all posts of an individual
View our own posts
List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)
Other functions:
Due to limited storage space, client app compresses the uploaded image to the maximum of 250px (width or height)
User avatar is created by hashing user id and convert that hash code into a hexagonal image
Authentication and authorization use JWT
Responsive frontend for desktop and mobile devices
Technical stack:
Frontend: ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Bootstrap
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Database: MongoDB
If this project is useful for you , please give me a Github star ⭐ for my effort!

事情是这样的，我以前的宽带套餐是 199 的套餐，之前在网上看到有人说可以用漫游的方式实现根据信号强度自动切换路由而且很稳定，在这方面我是小白，之后正好有电信客服联系我说可以升级 239 套餐，而且还可以免费帮我实现全屋信号优化，我以为是用的刚刚看到的漫游技术，我就接受了套餐升级。结果给我安装的时候只是安装了 2 个路由器，然后路由器名字不一样要我手动切换，这种方式我自己买个路由器就行，还需要他们来帮忙吗？
另外有个问题想问下，电信的安装人员说如果要做漫游，需要漫游的两个路由器直连，也就是说需要把一个路由器装在光猫的盒子里，可是这样那个装在光猫盒子里面的路由器信号就差了，漫游也失去了意义，相当于我损失了客厅的信号加强了卧室的信号。关于这个说法是正确的吗？正确的漫游方式到底是怎么样的？我通过学习可以自己在家里实现漫游吗？]]></summary>

自己实现了，但现在主要的问题是产品嫌速度慢，和原生相机拍照速度有差距。
要求速度是基本和原生相机 app 一样，点一下照片就拍完了，不能有明显的停顿感。
但拍照 sdk 这种需求比较少，一般 app 如果专做拍照，那肯定不用第三方了。

  The issue


For a generation of young people who have de-stigmatized mental illness, we are shocked to discover that finding a therapist is as appalling as our dating culture: an arduous ghosting game. Patients wait an average of 10 weeks to see a mental health professional, just to receive a diagnosis!

本周话题：最大的机会来自新技术
上周六是 iPhone 诞生十五周年。
2007年1月9日，乔布斯从口袋里掏出一个小玩意，对着全世界说，今天苹果公司重新发明了电话。


你还记得那个时刻吗？
当时谁能想到，这个小玩意对人类社会的改变，将是如此巨大！
过去的十五年，可能是历史上科技变革最快的时期。回忆以前的生活，恍若隔世，没有微信、没有二维码、没有手机付款、网络外卖、手机打车、手机直播......
短短十五年，智能手机就把这些东西，推广到了城市和乡村的每一个角落。
这带来了极其巨大的商业机会。十五年前，小米（2010年4月6日成立）、美团（2010年1月成立）、字节跳动（2012年3月成立）、滴滴（2012年6月成立）这些巨头都还不存在。（顺便提一句，比特币的诞生是在2009年1月3日。）
一个革命性的设备出现，能带来这么多机会！
现在回想起来，我多么希望，在乔布斯掏出 iPhone 的那个时刻，我能够意识到它会带来无与伦比的机会，从而转向这个方向发展。那样的话，人生将会多么不同啊。
可惜，当时我完全没有这种意识，只觉得 iPhone 只是一个时髦的产品，比黑莓或者塞班手机更好用一些，市场潜力大概跟它们差不多。我就这样错过了机会。
手机革命开始很久以后，我才意识到，自己的眼光有多么局限和短浅。我也由此明白了，五年后、十年后、十五年后，科技带来的巨大变化，是你所无法…]]></summary>

Unfortunately today there are many species in danger of extinction or disappearing.
SPECIESS is a space that aims to help a little to raise awareness about this problem as a website to create, explore and share artworks with CSS on endangered species taken from the IUCN Red List
You can check it at: speciess.vercel.app

 SPECIESS 
   
This project is born as an initiative for the Atlas MongoDB & Dev.to Hackaton. 😄
SPECIESS is an space where to create, explore and share CSS art about endangered species (from the IUCN Red List) and so spread raise awareness about it.
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
First, run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
Next.js Documentation - learn about Next.js features and API.
Learn Next.js - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
View on GitHub
This project is built using Next.js and deployed with Vercel.
I am using the powerful MongoDB Atlas.
This DB storing information about 142 000 species from the IUCN Red List.
It's my first time using MongoDB and I found it quite easy to get started with, even with a lot of documentation, but understandable.
I am using the MongoDB Data API to store some info.
It was very interesting and comfortable to use MongoDB Charts in this project too.
Here are some screenshots of the project:






PS: I really liked how powerful MongoDB Atlas is, my only observation would be that it would be great to add more examples with more use cases for Node.js 😉]]></summary>

2021 年前，我和身边朋友说 “5G 并没有什么太大作用，并且投入产出比都没有未来经济效益” 该言论让我成为茶余饭后的谈资，负面的，搞笑的，弱智的代表。
因为当时基本上所有朋友包括很多网络工程师都相信“5G 会改变未来” 除了我在运营商和部份搞 EE 的朋友，他们和我一样，是非常小众的一群人。
2022 年了，全世界 5G 密度最高，部署量最大，政策最用的国家，就是中国了。
而 5G 是不是好，目前我在运营商和 EE 的朋友都呵呵一笑。
而 5G 的炒作也已经冷淡下来。
有个朋友和我说“国内部署的 5G 基站已经比整个欧洲都多了，从我们的层面看这是不合理的，但是从补贴层面看，我管他啊”]]></summary>

We built a web application using the Shiny framework from the R programming language to help users locate & report at-home COVID-19 test kits. You can check out the web app live in action here for the State of Connecticut!
This app works very similar to the Waze app, in that the data that populates the app is entirely user-driven. Through the UI, users have the ability to add a new record to the back-end MongoDB Atlas database (i.e., where/when they saw COVID-19 at-home test kits in stock), and remove a record (where/when they saw COVID-19 at-home test kits out of stock).
The purpose of this project spawned from seeing so many disjointed Facebook forum questions/answers about where people could find at-home COVID-19 antigen test kits. There was no single place t…]]></summary>

A healthy codebase is one that’s optimized for testability, maintainability, and scalability. It helps programmers code more efficiently and makes engineering teams more productive. 
The health of a company’s codebase plays a large role in employee satisfaction. Unfortunately, the pressure to quickly add new features imposes harsh deadlines on programmers. The trade-off is a decrease in code quality. This is the reality of the software development world. We can expect a level of imperfection in any company’s codebase, but the important thing is how responsible a company is about resolving or preventing the damage that results from pushing r…]]></summary>

首先这里声明一下
一 、Overqualified 在 IT 相关专业上基本不存在，但是 EE 就还是有的。
二、以硅谷程序员为代表的留学生群体普遍认为 IT 之外的少数几个专业都是白读的。因为他们的薪水根本没办法和硅谷对标。而没有选择 IT 就是他们人生路上的失败（一堆硅谷 IT 的失败学定义）
三、IT 专业确实是目前普通人在正常努力范围内可以拿到薪水较高的工作，但是不代表其它专业不重要。生化环材是世界的基石。虽然他们在硅谷 IT 人眼里都是笑话。
正式开始讲讲
很多人都说在澳洲，本科比研究生好。所以甚至传出了澳洲的研究生都是水货，本科才是最好的，要么本科要么博士，千万不要读研究生这种言论。
为什么会出现这种言论的呢，本质上是因为我们这边对性价比太看重了，即我毕业后一定要像国内 985 ，211 一样要在就职市场横着走，如果不是的，就是不好的。
但是实际上，在澳洲除了华人企业和部份小的企业，大部份情况下，研究生出门确实在工作上出现了困难，比如我的老婆和我老婆的同学，他们都是传统专业毕业的，不像 IT 毕业就是澳洲收入中位数，他们毕业要找工作非常困难。]]></summary>

CPU bench 结果：

看起来 Aarch64 机器算质数会更快一些，但实际上编译 CMake 来看：

aarch64: 1m20.135s

另一个项目更加明显
x86_64: 5m14s

显然 x86_64 机器会更快。我已经尽可能排除两台机器其他变量的干扰（均有 64GB 内存，NVME 固态硬盘）。

Before we discuss about what a web service API is, let's learn what what a web service is.
The term Web service is either: a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents.
Apart from the main web APIs, there are also web service APIs:

I made an Express application which basically calculates the path from one station to another in a particular city's Metro rail map.
It connects to the database on Mongodb Atlas. My database has collections based on maps of different cities.
The app is very easily scalable, as to add a map, one only has to add a new collection in the database (containing Station names etc) and one option in the "Map Select" drop-down.
Here is the link to my Github repository.
Choose Your Own Adventure
 / 
        metro-path-mongodb
      
    
Note: The Mongodb database may refuse to connect sometimes. I am finding a fix for that
This is a Metro Rail Path Finder app I made for Dev.to + MongoDb Atlas Hackathon. It sources its data from Mongodb Atlas Database.
Technology Used: Expressjs, MongoDb Atlas
Just make sure that node and npm are installed and
npm start


And it will be deployed on http://localhost:3000/users/details
The calculation may get slow for longer paths.

Technology Used: Express, Mongodb, Atlas

在 Java 不用强制我们处理空对象，所以常常会导致 NullPointerException 空指针出现，现在 Kotlin 对空对象进行了限定，必须在编译时处理对象是否为空的情况，不然会导致编译不通过
在对象不可空的情况下，可以直接使用这个对象
fun getText() : String {
    return "text"
}

val text = getText()
print(text.length)

在对象可空的情况下，必须要判断对象是否为空
fun getText() : String? {
    return null
}

val text = getText()
if (text != null) {
    print(text.length)
}

// 如果不想判断是否为空，可以直接这样，如果 text 对象为空，则会报空指针异常，一般情况下不推荐这样使用
val text = getText()
print(text!!.length)

// 还有一种更好的处理方式，如果 text 对象为空则不会报错，但是 text.length 的结果会等于 null
val text = getText()
print(text?.length)

方法支持添加默认参数
在 Java 方法上，我们可能会为了扩展某个方法而进行多次重载

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是不跟随
这段时间打 VALORANT ，有个队友只要一起打了，话题里总少不了「鼠标」和「握姿」这两个关键词。于是一个朋友受不了了，跟我吐槽。
首先让我们明确一点，你玩任何游戏，上限一定不是你的鼠标和你的握姿。决定你上限的只有你的训练量和你的年龄。打不准，那就多练；反应慢，一个是多练，还有一个就是你不再年轻。
这个队友呢，年纪比较小，还没有形成自己的一套体系。所以总是想跟着 UP 主的理论去选择自己的鼠标。并且对于握姿的选择非常纠结，总是在为了「哪个握姿上限更高」这样的问题来回矛盾。那么就让我们再明确一次，握姿与你的上限无关。举个很简单的例子，CSGO 传奇选手 Simple 的鼠标握姿既不是抓握也不是趴握更不是指握，而是将趴握和抓握混合在一起运用。
所谓「不跟随」，在上一篇我说过，对于游戏设备，我们「更多的关注应该在，它是不是符合你的需求」。盲目地迷信传感器参数或者鼠标尺寸与手掌大小这些参数，并不能帮你找到合适的鼠标并且提升能力。一千个人的心中有一千个哈姆雷特，同样，对于鼠标的选择，每个人都是不一样的。别人的数据只是参考，真正应该关注的，反而应该是自己的使用体验。

我的选择与标准
首先，让我们看看鼠标类型
鼠标无非两种类型，一种是对称鼠标，一种是人体工学鼠标。而人体工学鼠标往往很多厂家又会对它在某些方面进行优化。总体来讲就是这两大类。
对称鼠标的代表，近几年比较火的，就是罗技的 G pro wireless 与雷蛇的毒蝰系列。人体工学鼠标的代表就是 Steelseries 当年为微软代工的 IE 3.0 系列鼠标。喜欢用哪一种，因人而异。有的人喜欢对称，有的人喜欢人体工学，甚至有人喜欢强制人体工学。对称鼠标，就如同名字一样，鼠标是对称的。人体工学鼠标，是贴合人手放松状态下的模样做出的鼠标，因此这种类型的鼠标与手的贴合度高，手指有充分的休息区域。
再来，我的选择标准

2 音响和手机各自独立，可以一边音响听歌，一边手机刷视频
默认都是 1 ，如果一直都是 1 的话，也好理解，就是普通蓝牙音响。但是偏偏偶尔情况下能触发 2 ，导致我很好奇
而且根据我的体验，我也是更喜欢 2 的（音响播放 bgm ，同时手机玩别的）
现在已知可以触发 2 的方式：
1 对话音响的 siri ，比如播放周杰伦的歌，就会用 qq 音乐单独播放（只是很傻，想听龙卷风，结果播放的是另一首歌）
2 对话音响，调用自己设置过的捷径，也能触发 2

所有有人知道其中的逻辑吗，我目前的发现是必须用音响的 siri 才能触发 2 ，不能手动触发]]></summary>

你是一个 Saas 服务，我所有的销售数据、会员数据全放在你那，你倒闭咋办？服务不稳定咋办？ 数据丢失了昨弄？
大意了！！！这一块也是重中之重。
作为一个程序员，我能想到的
涉及安全方面
登录不能粗暴的种 cookie ，要把用户的地域、网络环境也放进去，当发生特别大的改变时，Cookie 无效
密码错误，对该账户时间递增暂定登录服务
记录每一个登录日志
JS 注入，Demo 网址开放后，大家真的好喜欢注入，那么所有的输入都要进行严格的过滤
数据的报障方面
群集，加强数据的备份
多云部署，这个要根据成本来考虑，但现在云也便宜了 腾讯云 8 核 16G 三年还不到￥ 2000 ，可以搞起
备份，写个定时脚本 深夜触发，但数据量大了咋办呢？
高可用
这一块一直在进行, 对一个初始项目，权重没那么高
分布式 包括服务、数据库、搜索、Cache
细节的优化 HTTP2 、BR 压缩、启用 Webp 、升级 TLS
高延迟的任务全部异步化
数据敏感问题
这个是 Saas 无法避免的问题，对同质的需求提供统一的服务，还真没办法解决。。。
难道加钱独立部署么？
额外：
以前一直忽略物联网， 对于库存的管理，我一直想的是条形码管理，今天在用无人零售柜，看了下它的电子标签，
咿 RFID 射频识别， 同步到互联网，对仓储管理肯定也好用啊]]></summary>

听着，这是你的第二十个年头，所以这有一些事情需要你懂得，并且根植于心：
1. 做你真正想做的事情，道德和法律都不应该成为你的障碍；
2. 不要总围着人类打转。在这个世界上，除了人类，还有很多事物，所以不要总以人类为参照，在其他事物上你会获得更多东西；
3. 当你接触一些事物的时候，请试图发现它的本质。怎样拍电影，怎样拍照片，怎样创建一家公司，当你懂得它们的原理，你会变得更有创造力；
4. 世间没有真理。对那些指引你的人，以及书籍，请始终抱持怀疑。如果有真理，那可能只针对大多数人，而没准你就属于那少数的几个人；
5. 创造比学习更快乐，更有趣，也更重要；
6. 永远做自己的朋友和后背，只有这样你才能避免孤独；
7. 你现在所说的话，只代表你当前的想法。所以半途而废是很正常的，没有必要责备自己。当然，不要轻易对他人和自己做出承诺。

没想到当初的自己爱喝鸡汤，哈哈。]]></summary>

比如，如果我想 clone 一下 spring boot 的源码。
地址是

那么，我就会创建 3 层文件夹：github.com、spring-projects、spring-boot（最后一个一般 clone 的时候自己生成）然后放里面
github.com
└── spring-projects
    └── spring-boot

如果是 b 站上的学习视频https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV164411b7dx
我就会创建bilibili.com、BV164411b7dx 吴恩达机器学习系列课程这两个文件夹然后放里面
bilibili.com

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能可以识别匿名棋手

研究人员收集了多次下棋的棋手记录，并从中抽取了多达 32 步的序列。他们对每一步棋进行编码，并将其输入一个神经网络，每个棋手的棋谱形成了一个点群。研究发现，该系统可以在 86% 的时间里识别匿名的玩家，而人工识别的准确率只有 28%。经过调整，它也可以对扑克牌做同样的事情。他们说，在理论上，如果有合适的数据集，这种系统可以根据人们的驾驶习惯或使用手机的时间和地点来识别他们。


老王点评：人类的很多行为，其实在 AI 眼中都是非常明显的痕迹。




Ubuntu 桌面版降低硬件门槛

由于 Ubuntu 桌面对内存的需求比较大，因此如果在树莓派上使用的话，Ubuntu 推荐用户使用 4GB/8GB 内存的型号，以避免在慢速的 SD 卡上发生交换。Canonical 宣布 进一步降低 Ubuntu Desktop 的硬件门槛，支持在 2GB 内存的树莓派 4 上运行。之所以能够降低硬件需求，主要是得到了 zswap 功能的支持，可以减少交换到慢速 SD 卡的进程。该功能可以在进程要被转移到交换文件时，对其进行压缩，以决定是否需要放到交换文件，否则可以避免交换，而解压成本要低得多。


老王点评：不用等 22.04 ，当前版本中经过设置也可以启用 zswap。




Chrome 将阻止外部域名访问本地网络

为防止恶意脚本悄悄在浏览器上执行本地 HTTP 请求，Chrome 将 实现 名为 私有网络访问（PNA） 的 W3C 新规范，阻止这一被恶意程序滥用的行为。新功能将在今年上半年推出，PNA 将在 Chrome 中引入一个机制，外部域名在尝试与本地网络设备建立连接前需要征得许可，如果本地设备如服务器或路由器没有回应，尝试建立连接的请求将被阻止。


老王点评：我以为这是已经是默认行为了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[只需掌握一点 C 语言的知识，你就可以做很多事情。




我精通几种编程语言，但我最喜欢的是 C 语言。C 语言开发于 20 世纪 70 年代，作为一种系统编程语言，在 2021 年仍然是最受欢迎的编程语言之一。如果你想探索 C 语言的几个特点，可以从去年的这些热门文章开始：

在 C 语言中使用 getopt 进行短选项解析

如果你的程序每次运行时都能对用户作出反应，你就可以使它变得更加灵活。让你的用户告诉你的程序使用什么文件或如何以不同的方式做事情。为此，你需要读取命令行。这篇文章 告诉你如何使用 argv 直接读取命令行，并使用 getopt 读取短命令行选项。

在 Linux 中用 ncurses 定位屏幕上的文本

大多数 Linux 工具只是从屏幕的底部滚动文本。但如果你想在屏幕上定位文本，比如游戏或数据显示，该怎么办？这就是 ncurses 的作用。

用 DOS conio 开始编程

C 语言并不只适用于 Linux。你可以在许多操作系统上找到 C，包括 DOS。许多 C 程序员控制控制台输入和输出的标准方法是使用 conio 库。学习如何 使用 conio` 来更新 DOS 程序的控制台，包括文本颜色和文本窗口。

使用位域和掩码编写国际象棋游戏

在 C 语言程序中关联信息的标准方法是使用一个结合了两个或多个相关字段的结构体。例如，你可以用一个结构体来跟踪棋盘上的棋子。但是有一种更直接的方法来跟踪同样的信息，同时使用更少的数据和内存。使用 二进制位域和掩码，你可以存储一个单一的值来识别每个方格中的棋子和颜色。

C 语言编程中的 5 个常见错误以及如何修复它们

即使是最好的程序员也会产生编程错误。根据你的程序所做的事情，这些 bug 可能会引入安全漏洞，导致程序崩溃，或产生意外的行为。但是，通过一点额外的代码，你可以避免最常见和最严重的 C 语言编程错误。这里有 五个可能破坏你的应用的 bug 以及你如何避免它们。

只需一点 C 语言知识，你就可以做很多事情。探索新的方法，为你的下一个 C 语言编程项目增加功能。

所以我想询问下，还有没有机会获取到 Android 设备级的唯一标识？我是正常目的用，因为有些用户买了软件的单机版，虽然告知了不要卸载，但为了体验，还是应该端永久，但我实在没辙，我想在外部存储放一个激活文件，但是用户也很有可能删掉，比如无意删掉、格式化设备等。]]></summary>

@BeckMint：GL8 座椅

入手渠道：闲鱼自购
入手价格：518 元

前年老麦搞了个人体工学座椅的测评，做完之后我挑了最硬的那个网易严选的座椅，一坐就是一年多。这个座椅除了硬之外，坐着坐着屁股还会往下滑，但我对于座椅没什么太大要求，就将就着了。
最近在网上看到一句话，大概意思是挑选电脑椅，就挑最难坐的，难坐到你想经常站起来走走。我一想这不就是我的情况嘛，然后连续站立办公了两天，当天晚上睡觉到三点钟，小腿抽筋了……
就是这个契机，我想换个舒服点的办公座椅。
又刚好在微博上看到有人炫耀将 GL8 的中排座椅改成办公座椅，说什么是最舒服的座椅，还比什么人体工学座椅便宜多了，好奇之下买了回来。

整个座椅非常重，具体没称过，但收货时是我和物流小哥合力搬上来的，累的够呛。
座椅除了椅子部分，还有底部商家自己做的带万向轮的支架。

支架比较粗糙，安装时也不是对着槽镶嵌，而是用螺丝强行固定的，装好后是个正方形结构，还是偏移到右边的。

座椅底下部分真的不忍直视，但其实平时也看不到。
商家声称是新车改装拆掉，是全新的，看上去还行，有些污渍应该是拆卸或搬运过程中留下的。

右手边有杯托，按压一下就弹出，可以放个保温杯，不占桌面还挺好。

还有备受同事嘲笑的安全带，但你们不知道我做事又快又稳，安全第一吗。

座椅靠背可以往后放倒，看上去可以躺平的。其实汽车座椅如果要在上面睡觉，腰部肯定要额外的支撑，一个靠谱的腰枕是必不可少的。

头枕也可以根据不同身高，后脑勺的位置进行上下调节。但汽车座椅的头枕是为了安…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[付费订阅服务是一个时不时就会引起热议的话题。去年底，国内外就分别出现过两次付费订阅相关的讨论。
国内，爱奇艺在 2021 年 12 月 15 日进行了全方面的提价，他们认为「视频平台的会员订阅价格一直偏低，这一现象已影响到了行业的健康发展」了；国外，网红笔记软件 Notability 从「买断制」转成订阅制，在引起广泛不满后道歉，并宣布老用户无需订阅亦可使用已购功能。
在涉及订阅制和付费的讨论中，一种常见论述是「国外用户付费意愿高，服务定价也高；国内用户付费意愿低，服务定价也低」。这种说法在多大程度上是准确的呢？下面我们分别来讨论。
国外用户付费意愿一定更高吗？
在我看来，如今国内网友们付费的意愿并不低；虽然有些应用突然改成订阅很难受，但开发者要生存大家也能理解，对于质量好的也越发愿意付费支持。此类事件中，更让大家觉得懊恼的，是厂商并没有给付费用户提供更好的、符合预期的产品，例如应用对已解锁功能重复收费、视频平台展示所谓「会员专属广告」等。
当然，准确的观察还是要通过数据来得出。
2021 年，美国一家咨询公司 West Monroe 对 2500 名美国用户开展了调查，并于八月发布了一份题为《订阅服务开支现状》（The State of Subscription Services Spending）的报告。报告显示，2021 年美国消费者人均订阅服务开支为每月 273 美元，比疫情前 2018 年的 237 美元提高了 15%。这相当于每年多花了 430 美元，折合人民币近 3000 元。

需要指出，West Monroe 报告中的「订阅服务」包括了网费、手机话费等，这些服务在美国的价格非常高昂，而且也不属于本文想讨论的「订阅服务」范畴。将这两项（合计 150 美元）除去后，剩下的实际平均开支应为每人每月 123 美元。
那我们国内的情况怎么样呢？由于找不到比较系统的研…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为独立开发者 + 业余吉他手，很早前就想开发一款练习歌曲的工具。因为在练习歌曲时，经常需要针对某一个片段播放上百上千次，有时候需要变调（演奏跟原调不一样）、变速等…… 
这些场景在使用 QQ 音乐之类的播放器时，就显得略为不便，找了一圈也没发现特别趁手的工具。得益于技术的进步，特别是音轨分离的技术（有兴趣可以参考 Splitter.ai）的成熟，感觉针对于「如何更高效地学习歌曲」这个课题，我们可以做出一些更 Cool 更好玩有用的东西。
这就有了我们最近发布的一款音乐工具产品：AudioJam。
功能介绍
使用 AI 技术，AudioJam 能从任意的歌曲中，提取出人声、鼓、贝斯、钢琴或键盘、吉他以及其他的音轨，并可以调整音量 Remix。这个技术在扒谱或者跟歌练习的时候特别有用。
为了表现它惊艳的分离效果，我制作了一个简单的视频：
 
分离了音轨之后，在电脑端你甚至可以通过重新安排不同乐器的位置，重新混响音乐，模拟更真实的效果。

设置并保存循环之后，就可以不断重复该循环，用于片段的练习。

如果是常用软件，每个细节都是很重要的，因为如果不好用，那每次使用都会给自己添堵。所以在 AudioJam 中，与传统播放器只能通过拖动进度条来定位不同，你还可以拖动波形图，做到精准地控制播放的位置。AudioJam 还支持直接长按波形图由该位置开始慢速预览，这在扒取一些快速音符的时候很有用。
通过降速功能则可以有效地降低学习难度，也可以通过升降调，找到最适合自己演奏的曲调。

「音乐附件」是我自己很喜欢的一个功能，可以在音乐项目中。创建便签来记录扒谱的结果、需要注意的地方，也可以导入现有的曲谱，当前附件支持预览 Guitar Pro 的曲谱。将歌曲的学习项目化。

我个人觉得对于歌曲学习来说，移动应用并非最好用的工具，在歌曲学习这件事情上，我还是比较喜欢桌面应用，可以更精准地控制跟快速地输入，因此 AudioJam 支持了 iOS、Android、macOS、Windows 4 个平台。

自动扒谱？
很多朋友，在试用了 AudioJam 之后都给我提出了一个想法，它能不能做到自动扒谱呢？这个课题我个人的看法是这样的：
我个人不太认可自动扒谱这件事情，因为音乐学习，不应该以变成「人肉读谱机」为目标。而是通过视听扒谱，去理解鉴赏这个音乐作品，而这个过程是就是不断提升自己音乐审美观以及听力的过程，不应该通过技术来偷懒。
现在互联网的信息发达，大部分的歌曲都能找到别人精心编排好的乐谱，自动扒取的还无法达到这样的水平。不过我也可能会在未来添加上这样的功能。因为扒谱这件事对新手而言太不友好了，如果能自动扒谱的话，作为一个「参考答案」来辅助学习扒谱的话，可以让学习扒谱这件事变得更简单，学习曲线更平缓，也是一个「高效学习」的好功能。
所以我们也有在调研一些相关的技术，如果有朋友对相关的音视频技术有研究的话，也欢迎跟我们一起探讨。

如果你也有在玩一些乐器，比如吉他、鼓、钢琴或键盘之类的。AudioJam 绝对是一款对音乐学习很有帮助的产品。希望你可以自己下载来体验试试。
最后，学无止境，与君共勉。希望大家能一直保持，对吉他和对音乐的热爱。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[早在 2017 年，我便萌生了写一篇读书总结文章的念头，那一年是我开始大规模读书的第一年，在那之前不过是每年读个三五本书。至今我都记得 2017 年第一本读完的书是《杀死一只知更鸟》，但到现在，书里的人物、剧情全然忘却，只记得那是一本有关教养与教化的书籍。
五年过去了，每年我都能读完至少三四十本书，可如今再翻看那些书单，大多数书籍都和《知更鸟》一样，在记忆中没有留下什么痕迹。于是在今年，我开始了写读书笔记的计划，长篇大论也好、三五句也行。我在读完一本书时，趁着记忆还没消散，就把杂想随想写下，在今后随时翻阅时希冀能回想起什么。也因如是，才有了这一篇总结文章。
每一天，我都会在夜晚睡觉前，躺在床上捧着 Kindle 读半小时书再入睡。从去年底开始我用上了专注计时工具，来摒除手机对专注阅读的影响。因为不知道哪款软件更趁手，索性同时使用了 iHour 和 OffScreen 来专注计时。到如今打开 App 看统计数据，今年的累计阅读时间已经超过 227 小时了。
我们常常高估一天能做成的事，却往往低估一年能做的事。

除了睡前阅读，偶尔我也会在通勤地铁里、出差飞机上，还有咖啡店里读书。本文中的所有图片都是这一年我在杭州咖啡探店时拍摄的，衷心感谢杭州精品咖啡店提供的美味咖啡☕️。
《怎样才能不杀死你的植物》
《怎样才能不杀死你的植物》 是我在 1 月份读完的，这本书对于我而言是家养绿植的启蒙书。在我读完这本书之后先后养起了龟背竹、富贵竹、琴叶榕、牛油果这四类植物。快一年过去了，到现在还谈不上棵棵枝繁叶茂，但至少还没有被我杀死。
作者妮卡·萨瑟恩是英国网红植物商店的店主，在她商店的 Instagram 账号上，有大量精美好看的插花作品。她常年和植物打交道，自然而然地对于如何才能把家养绿植养得生机勃勃这一问题，有着丰富的养护经验。妮卡的方法论便是追根溯源，只要去了解植物的原生环境，并在家…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-01-13T03:49:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个题目分为两个方面：
一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；
二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。
1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？
1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的
将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。
最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。
1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度
将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。
如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。
这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。
只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。
下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。

1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果
至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。



2.什么样的是好发动机
热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。
低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。
低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。
高可靠性无需多言。
两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。

和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

前言
我之前在 Newsletter 里分享了用 Craft X Snippets 记录晨间日记的方法，评论区收到一个关于 Daily Notes 如何归档整理的小问题，回复中也思考了一番 Craft 这个应用本身。作为我在过去的一年中最喜爱、又带给我很大帮助的应用，想在新年伊始为它当一回「传教者」，在此展开讲讲，它有哪些特别之处，我为何喜欢它，以及一些使用上的研究和小技巧；当然，也会有它的不足。

Craft 是去年 Apple 评选的 Mac App of the Year，也获得了 Apple Design Award「交互」赛道提名，足以说明它一定有值得称道之处。少数派在 App Store Awards 2021 这篇文章中说它是：

虽然上线仅一年，Craft 的功能和体验却完全不输许多老牌笔记工具。在过去的一年多时间里，Craft 以非常高的迭代速度陆续带来了网页版本、实时协作、Daily Notes 等特性，几乎每个月都会推出新的重要功能。此次获得奖项，可谓实至名归。

是的，Craft 在 2020 年 11 月正式上线，到今天也就差不多一年的工夫。团队的精心打磨，使得它一上线就有着非常高的完成度。而过去一年中又陆续发布了 21 个大更新和 26 个小更新，也就是说，几乎每 2-2.5 周就会有一个大更新。我是从 iOS App Store 推荐知道它的，抱着试一试的态度，拿到手就被教学关近乎完美的动效吸引。在花了一点点时间探索，并看了帮助…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[项目环境切换问题：
遇到的问题：
1.项目网络环境很多，包括5楼环境（网络地址和MQTT地址不同）、12楼环境（网络地址和MQTT地址相同）、新部署环境等，每次打包修改地址容易出错且耗时
2.APP的自动更新依赖于版本名和VersionCode，项目依赖的AAR包经常更新
解决方案：
利用gradle构建工具的特性，修改build.gradle脚本，实现网络环境根据版本名自动切换，这样查看APK文件名就能知道网络环境，且不需要反复修改地址代码
使用manifestPlaceholders控制网络切换:


效果：
以前切换网络环境、切换AAR、发布版本需要修改内容：




需要修改4个文件的6处内容
重构后切换网络环境、切换AAR、发布版本需要修改内容：

只需修改一个文件的两处内容：一个是AAR版本，一个是版本名
版本号、AAR依赖、网络环境会自动根据以上两处进行切换，只需根据注释修改
代码实现
1.在manifest文件的Application标签内增加：


2.在java代码中增加：
public static int getMetaDataInt(String metaName, int defaultValue) {
    try {
        return MyApplication.getInstance().getPackageManager()
                .getApplicationInfo(MyApplication.getInstance().getPackageName(), PackageManager.GET_META_DATA)
                .metaData.getInt(metaName, defaultValue);
    } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return defaultValue;
    }
}

3.在app的build.gradle中使用：
//----------------------根据versionName自动配置网络->->->->->->-------------------
def hospital_net = 0, floor_12 = 1, new_env = 2
def network_env
if (versionName.toString().startsWith("2")) {
    network_env = floor_12
} else if (versionName.toString().startsWith("3")) {
    network_env = new_env
} else {
    network_env = hospital_net
}
manifestPlaceholders = [network_env: network_env,]

versionName '1.2.04' // 1开头是院内环境，2开头就是12楼环境，3开头是新部署环境
//------]]></summary>

D8
D8是一款用于取代 DX、更快的 Dex 编译器，可以生成更小的 APK;
开启D8的好处
编译更快、时间更短
编译时占用内存更小
.dex文件更小
.dex 文件拥有更好的运行时性能
支持在代码中使用 Java 8 语言
开启与关闭
Android Studio 3.0 需要主动在gradle.properties文件中新增:android.enableD8=true
D8作为DX的一个替代方案,Android Studio 3.1版本开始，将D8作为默认的Dex编译器。
想关闭D8 ，可以在gradle.properties里添加如下配置：
android.enableD8=false //关闭D8恢复到DX-
android.enableD8.desugaring=false //恢复到以前的行为，让脱糖发生在Java编译之后，.class字节码仍遵循Java 7格式

执行增量构建
为了在开发过程中提高构建速度（例如提高持续集成 build 的速度），可以指示 d8 仅编译项目的部分 Java 字节码;
例如，如果启用了按类 dexing 处理，则只需重新编译自上次构建以来修改过的类(d8 无法自动检测哪些字节码文件已被修改过，因此您需要手动指定类列表)：
//执行几个类的增量构建，并启用按类 dexing 处理,并为增量构建指定输出目录
d8 MainActivity.class R.class --intermediate --file-per-class --output ~/build/intermediate/dex

可以使用 --main-dex…]]></summary>

前言
众所周知，应用安装包的体积会十分影响用户的应用下载速度和安装速度。据 GooglePlay 平台对外发布相关的包大小对转化率影响的数据，我们可以看到随着包大小的增加，安装转化率总体呈下降的趋势。

因此对于我们的应用来说，为了提升我们用户下载的转化率（即下载安装激活用户与潜在用户的比例），我们对包体积必须给予一定的优化和管控。
我们应用商店中提供给用户下载的安装包，是 Android 定义的 APK 格式，其实质则是一个包含应用所有所需资源的 zip 包，它包含了如下所示的几个组成部分：

这其中最主要的组成部分便是 DEX 文件，它们都是由 Java/Kotlin 代码编译而成。过去的两年中，抖音的 DEX 的个数从 8 个涨到了 21 个，DEX 的总大小从 26M 涨到了 48M，增长十分迅猛。诚然，随着抖音的快速发展，业务复杂度的提高，代码量级一定是在增加的，但如何在业务无感的情况下，对代码进行通用优化，也是我们一个很重要的优化方向。
在介绍具体优化手段之前，我们首先需要了解下针对 DEX 整体上的优化思路。
DEX 通用优化思路
在 AGP 的构建过程中，Java 或 Kotlin 源代码在经过编译之后会生成 Class 字节码文件，在这个阶段 AGP 提供了 Transform 来做字节码的处理，我们非常熟悉的 Proguard 就是在这个阶段工作的，之后 Class 文件经由 dexBuilder 生成一堆较小的 DEX 文件，再经由 mergeDex 合并成最终的 DEX 文件，然后打入 APK 中。具体过程如下图所示：

因此，我们针对 DEX 文件的优化时机可以从分别从三个阶段切入，分别是.kt 或.java 源文件、class 文件、DEX 文件：
在源文件进行处理也就是手…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[孩子们可以使用 Linux 发行版吗？它又是否适合学校使用呢？

嗯，这取决于你有什么选择，以及你想选择的是什么。不管你是想给孩子还是学校老师用，都有不少选择。

因此，为了给你一个良好的开端，我们策划了一个为教育量身定做的 最佳 Linux 发行版 列表。

最适合儿童的 Linux 发行版

对于一个孩子来说，发行版必须提供一个用户友好的用户界面，而不是高级功能。

你可能会说，任何主流的、像 Ubuntu、Mint 或 Zorin 这样适合初学者的发行版都可以做到这一点。没错，但是如果一个发行版带有了 基本工具 并易于使用，孩子们会很快学会使用它并喜欢上它。

1、Endless OS



Endless OS 是一个流行的选择，是为教育量身定做的 Linux 发行版。

它以 Debian 为基础，使用 GNOME 桌面环境。尽管它限制了一年内在超过 500 台电脑上使用其操作系统，但它是免费下载的。

它的用户界面很容易使用，看起来很有吸引力，适合安装在现代电脑上。你可以得到各种预装的应用程序。因此，这对没有互联网接入的电脑来说是很方便的。

2、Ubermix



Ubermix 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Linux 发行版，旨在通过调整用户界面，摆脱不必要的应用程序，以及增加用于教育的必要工具/应用程序来降低复杂性。

它还提供了一种方法，在出现问题的情况下可以轻松地从系统问题中恢复。在内容过滤和 屏幕时间控制 方面有一个可选的家长控制功能，这确实很有用。

Ubermix 得到了积极的维护，并在其官方网站上提供了大量关于安装和故障排除的说明。

3、Kano OS（用于树莓派）



Kano OS 是为 6 至 14 岁的儿童教育而量身定做的计算套件。它就像高级版的树莓派，为年轻人提供了大量的 DIY 和编码活动…]]></summary>

八街九陌华灯璀璨
三千寂静一腔孤勇

照料你们难省心力

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[leviathan0992: 
接上条 2022 年，现在的黑苹果解决方案是什么?
.
分析了一波后, 自己在淘宝花了 2000 买了一个 mini 主机 i7-8750H 不带内存和硬盘, 在 JD 买了两条威刚的 8G 内存条(500) 和一个 500G 的三星 Nvme 硬盘(500), 合计 3000 元左右配了一台黑苹果, 本来想自己装系统，结果教程第一步就失败, 后来索性又花 120 在淘宝找了店家远程安装的黑苹果, 目前使用一切正常.
旧笔记本就闲置下来, 想把它改造成一个家用小服务器. 比起目前云厂商买的小服务器, 笔记本的配置还算可以. 云厂商买的低配轻量服务器, 除了部署博客以外别的什么也干不了, 加之前两天自己根据 huggingface 上机器学习的模型写了一个英汉互译的 RESTful 服务, 本来打算部署在公网上直接通过 alfred workflow 来使用结果发现连安装 pytorch 都会 OOM. 索性尝试把闲置的笔记本利用起来.
我的需求就是在笔记本部署一些简单的 TCP 服务可以直接暴露在公网使用, 或者能 SSH 上去编译 kernel 模块, 找了一圈内网穿透的工具, 配置使用都略带繁琐, 所以自己写了一个轻量级的内网穿透工具: spleen.
通过在一台具有公网 IP 的小型服务器(阿里云轻量)部署 spleen 进行转发, 可以随时随地访问(闲置笔记本)的 TCP 服务, 例如 SSH, HTTP/S 等.
公网服务器部署 spleen-server
# 配置端口转发规则
> vim .server.json

{
  "ServerIP"   : "0.0.0.0",  # 公网服务器监听地址
  "ServerPort"   : 1234,  # 公网服务器监听端口, 该端口用来与家庭服务器 /内网主机建立通信隧道
  "MappingPort" : [ # 端口映射规则
"5000:22",  # 即访问公网服务器的 5000 端口就等于访问家庭服务器 /内网主机的 22 端口
"5001:3306"
...
  ]
}

# 启动
> ./spleen-server -c .server.json


家庭服务器 /内网主机部署 spleen-client
./spleen-client -c .client.json

例如 SSH 服务, 在顺利部署 spleen 的客户端和服务端后, 通过公网服务器(假定 IP 为 1.1.1.1), 可以直接通过端口映射来连接闲置笔记本:
执行 ssh -p 5000 user@1.1.1.1 # 即可直接连接到家庭服务器 /内网主机

TODO
目前仅支持 TCP 服务转发, 下一步重点是安全性的提升, 后面会根据自己的需求考虑加入 UDP 服务转发.

2.1,Android中启动的方式
1，冷启动：如果App启动时，后台没有该应用进程，那么系统会重新创建一个进程分配给该应用，这种启动方式就是冷启动
2，热启动：如果App启动时，后台有该应用进程，那么系统就是直接使用已有进程
从两种启动方式的含义就可以看出，冷启动比较耗时，热启动一般比较快，我们要做的启动优化一般做的就是冷启动优化
2.2,冷启动流程

系统创建应用进程时间我们一般无法优化，这个是系统创建简单的流程

我们可以优化的地方就是
1，Application
2，SplashActivity
3，MainActivity
2.3,启动时间
1，通过命令
adb shell am start -W [packageName]/[packageName.MainActivity]

这个时候，如果启动的activity在Manifest中没有设置export:true，可能无法通过命令打开，需要设置这个
2，自己埋点
从上面的启动过程就可以知道，Android冷启动，系统要先创建一个进程，然后创建Application，我们可以在Application的attachBaseContext方法中开始埋点，这个埋点没有统计到系统创建进程的时间，但是这个过程，我们很难优化
/**
* 统计冷启动各个时间点的耗时

早先有这个想法，虽然有点鸡肋但是来了兴趣也就做了。不知道这种方式会不会更稳定，可能也会有觉得方便或者不方便的，看大家的需求了。
原理很简单，流量入口服务器对内外提供代理端口，对公网提供供流量出口服务器连接的端口，流量出口服务器只要有流量入口服务器的信息，就可以随时连接为流量入口服务器作为备用代理。
连接使用的是 HTTP2 ，需要配置 TLS 证书。

So, JavaScript (JS), I’m sorry.

When you walked into the room at that party in the East Village, I felt my heart drop. Yes, you were a little out there, a bit all over the map, but you were stunning; a beautiful mess that I couldn’t take my eyes off. 
We got to chatting and we had a lot in common. We could both be spontaneous…]]></summary>

本文描述的虚拟机内存管理优化方案，是从应用侧视角对 Android 虚拟机内存管理进行改造，优化了虚拟机对 LargeObjectSpace 的内存管理策略，间接增加其它内存空间使用上限。改造后的方案，32 位运行环境 LargeObjectSpace 的内存使用上限可达到 2G 甚至更多（64 位环境使用上限理论上会趋于无限大）。通过本方案可以最大程度上从系统侧解决诸多应用都会遇到的内存瓶颈和 OOM 问题，一键接入，安全可靠。
1.背景
Java OOM对于 Android 开发者来说并不陌生，随着应用愈发复杂，部分业务在设计之初为了更好的产品体验，往往会考虑用空间换时间，长此以往，有限的内存资源将会不堪重负，尤其是在一些重大活动期间，内存挑战会更加严峻，稍有不慎就会暴雷。
为了应对这种情况，开发同学往往会从应用层面进行优化，减少缓存，但随着产品持续迭代，内存问题始终如达摩克利斯之剑，让应用处于崩溃的边缘。好在 Android 系统维护人员也意识到了这种问题，从 Android O 系统开始，对 Java 内存管理策略进行了调整，重点包括实例化 Bitmap 对象时，Bitmap 源数据的内存不再通过虚拟机申请，而是直接在 Native 层申请和管理，因此这部分内存不会纳入虚拟机 Heap 内存统计，以此来减少 LargeSpace 的占用，进而间接增加了其他内存空间的实际使用范围（此消彼长的关系），如下示意图：

通过调整 Bitmap 的内存管理策略以减少虚拟机整体内存使用，的确带来了立竿见影的效果。以字节公司内部诸多 App 为例，Android O 之后的移动设备，Java OOM 远远低于早期的系统版本。
2.思考与破局
对于上述 Android 内存管理策略优化，可以看到其实只有 Android N 以上版本受益，但是市面上仍有大…]]></summary>

Clashing deadlines for assignments, last-minute rushed quizzes. The pressure was enormous and the environment around us was even scarier. So this specific problem of deadlines gave us an idea that could in general help us create a streamlined environment for evaluation and assessment.
Online classes have not only increased the burden on students but on educators equally. Evaluating hundreds of pages worth of handwritten assignments is tiring and boring. On discussing further we came to know that teachers spend more time on checking and evaluating our assi…]]></summary>

I dont want to have any credentials or API-keys in plain text on a server that others have access to, so I saved it as environment variables like most of us do.
When I looked for a better solution I found this gem for Powershell!
All commands below are run from PowerShell.

Nearly every programming language provides a way for us to develop a simple web server, such as Express.js, Go Gin or Python Flask. However, with the advent of serverless computing, we need to rethink some of the fundamentals of how APIs are developed and deployed. Chiefly:
Traditionally APIs are packaged into one deliverable; serverless architecture encourages to divide solutions up into many smaller units that are packaged and deployed individually.
Traditionally APIs are stateful applications that are started and stopped infrequently; serverless architecture encourages to start up compute tasks only on demand.
In this article, I will describe a way to develop a serverless API in TypeScript. The motivation is to develop a solution that makes it…]]></summary>

本篇的内容
交错动画可以是一个前后衔接的动画序列，也可以是重叠在一起的动画效果
交错动画的创建需要使用多个 Animation 对象，这些动画对象的控制只有一个
每一个动画对象都需要指定一个 Interval，来表明该动画在整个动画序列的起止时刻
使用 Tween 来创建每一个动画
交错动画是一个很直接的概念：页面上的动画效果是一系列的动画，而不是一个动画一个动画手动加上去的。动画可能是纯粹的系列动画，动画之间前后衔接。也可能动画之间部分或者完全的重叠。也可能是空白动画，啥也没发生。

案例
本篇文章使用基本的交错案例，更复杂的案例可以参考staggered_pic_selection。
basic_staggered_animation
staggered_pic_selection

每一个动画都有一个 0-1 闭区间 的Interval 的值
单个的动画叫做 interval ，每一个 interval 创建一个 Tween ，Tween 指定了开始
Tween 会创建动画并且动画由 controller 管理
下图演示了代码示例中 Interval 的使用，需要注意到以下的几点:
透明度的改变占据了整个动画时长的10%
透明度动画和宽度动画之间有一个小小的空档期
在时间线的最后25%的时间内没有任何动画
Padding动画和高度变化动画是完全重…]]></summary>

首先，在12306里进入「我的」页面，点击「乘车人」，找到自己的名字后点击最右边的修改按钮，如果是自己的账户，一般都在第一行的当前用户里。

接着，点击右上角的「修改」，然后拖动到最后一行，你会发现这里写着「学生」，点击这里。下图中写着成人是因为我自己的账户已经改过了。

最后，把学生切换成成人，输入12306的密码和验证码后，点击「完成」即可，从此以后买票就再也不会弹出「是否购买学生票」的选项了。

害，我真是忍不住了，要 Code Review 我能理解（已经在求助大家有没有提效的方案了），但还要求写注释和文档，说是为了方便知识共享和新人入职。
WTF ？也不看看我们的业绩压力，万一不巧被裁下个月就去喝西北风了，新人关我 P 事。
索性吐槽一下看看大家想法：
我经历过小中大厂，经历的大部分代码是没有注释的，某些写得像屎山的代码，看起来十分费劲，重构不好还要挨刀子背锅，被骂出 bug
我花力气看懂了，好心写了注释，好像也没人关心？老板也不怎么来 code review ，都是同事之间+1 和 LGTM ，感觉我吃力不讨好
我发现其他人写的 bug ，我都是飞书告诉他要修掉或者我自己默默修掉了，如果我再和老板说 xxx 的代码有问题，感觉有点像背后捅一刀？给老板感觉也不好，为了鸡毛蒜皮的事情邀功？
之前在一家外企用那破 Confluence 让我抓狂，现在公司用飞书文档体验好了，但维护起来麻烦啊，代码更新了 Readme 和文档也要更新
年底了，就问问大家，大家写文档和注释有年终奖不？（逃…
正经时间：
其实我打心底觉得写文档和注释是个好习惯，毕竟咱们是靠代码吃饭的，但在公司内部有业绩压力有时候是心有余力不足，况且好多时候工具和代码是割裂的。
因此我正在写一个 VSCode 的插件，做一款基于代码的协作和知识分享，而不是现在基于文档（ README 、飞书等）。
就目前而言，我希望先实现：
在代码仓库里写注释的时候，如果看到有价值的信息，可以在 IDE 里同步到飞书文档 /Github 的 Readme 里等（这块还在想）
IDE 里顺手创建一个 Github/Gitlab issue ，再分配给我的同事（这个已经在做）
同步消息到飞书群 /钉钉群大家都能看到，显得我中立一点不要像是个打小报和为了这件事打报告的人
老板，咱们有锅背锅，有功拿奖行不行。
不知道大家是否感兴趣？如果感兴趣的话留个联系方式，等我开发完之后发给大家做 beta 测试。也可以给我提点意见。
真是难为我这个写 Golang 的后端，每天下班后啃前端代码（不说了，去写了...
附带效果：
选择代码块

在插件上写个标题就能创建一个 Github Issue]]></summary>

待遇:  ~ - 15 (一般来说 13-15 ) - 看你的情况决定咯
因为是小公司，公司给到的工资可能最多 13 - 15
岗位性质: 前端 (vue 2 、vue 3) - 未来 react 、react-native 或者 flutter 
可能目前只招一人
加班情况: 无 (一般来说我最多晚走 30 分钟, 6.30, 没什么大事的话，7 点走光了, 有大事也是因为开会而不是开发问题)
公司情况: 开发人员比较少，公司人员也比较少，比较和谐，不会有任何压抑和压力的情况，工作内容视你自己安排的情况决定，秉持原则：先上线 - 再优化 ，下班基本不会有任何打扰你的情况，除非很急的事情 
是一家在线教育招聘平台，名称先不说了，我们主要是挣老外的钱和 B 端用户的钱
我们希望您
(这里的不列很厉害的技术)
- vue
- 原生 js
- 能独立开发能力 ( 不是要你独立开发，大家一起干 )
- 能良好沟通和理解需求的能力 （不要闷闷的）
- 能够主动学习，善于学习 (就是对目前的技术方向 敏感一点，主动去了解 - 面了许多人，都这不懂那不懂的，只会 vue ，这样的就不好了)
- 对一些没用过的技术有兴趣，并且有主动学习的能力 - 例如不仅仅局限于 前端的 vue jquery ，可能 react  或者其他的
因为我们和招聘平台是竞争关系，招不到人所以来这里了，如有打扰，感谢理解~~~
希望你能拿出匹配你工作年限的水平，我们公司比较人文主义，生活大于工作 ，不止于你~]]></summary>

家里的显示器是 4k144 的 xv282k 不指望他能显示 4k144 但是分辨率最高只能选到 2560x1440 也就是 2k 导致整个显示的都很模糊 请问各位大佬有什么办法让他显示成 4k 吗]]></summary>
