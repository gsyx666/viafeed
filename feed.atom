        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know what bootstrap is, bootstrap is a CSS framework. 
Here's why you should not use Bootstrap. 
When you start to see the same layout over, and over, and over again users begin to tune out. You’ve lost me. Your design looks like one of 6,000 other sites out there. And not just the same general layout, but the Exact. Same. Components.
”Let’s be honest: a great many of us are tired of seeing the same old Twitter Bootstrap theme again and again. Black header, giant hero, rounded blue buttons, Helvetica Neue. Yes, you can customize the header to be a different color, maybe re-color some of the buttons, use a different font. Ultimately, however, that doesn’t change anything—it still looks like Bootstrap.
h u g e!


Bootstrap will help you to build an attractive, responsive website, but some mobile users could be turned away by the slow loading time and battery drain issues. Bootstrap comes with a lot of lines of CSS and JS, which is a good thing, but also a bad thing because of the bad internet connection. And there’s also the problem with the server that will take all the heat for using such a heavy framework. Even when bootstrap is minified, it takes a lot of space
There is no faster framework than Tailwind when it comes to styling HTML. As a result, you can easily create good-looking layouts by styling elements directly. This is possible because Tailwind offers thousands of built-in classes that do not require you to create designs from scratch]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Para você desenvolvedor que tem uma ou mais contas no github e quer usar ssh para ter mais produtividade.
Vou mostrar como autenticar em duas contas do github usando chave ssh.
Iremos acessar a pasta .ssh
cd .ssh/
Depois iremos gerar a chave ssh com o nome do usuário do github ssh-keygen -f code_041_id_rsa

Em seguida iremos copiar o conteúdo no arquivo gerado pelo ssh cat code_041_id_rsa.pub e colocar no github.

Em seguida dentro da pasta .ssh, iremos criar o arquivo de configuração.
touch config
Iremos adicionar o Host e IdentityFile no arquivo de configuração da conta do github
Host github.com-code-041
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/code_041_id_rsa

Em seguida iremos gerar uma nova chave essa
ssh-keygen -f williamkoller_id_rsa
Iremos copiar a chave essa e colocar no github
cat williamkoller_id_rsa.pub

Agora iremos adicionar o Host e IdentityFile para a nova conta do github
Host github.com-williamkoller
   HostName github.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/williamkoller_id_rsa

Agora iremos testar, fazendo um clone de uma das contas do github.

Lembrando que precisamos colocar o nome do Host.
git clone git@github.com-williamkoller:williamkoller/hyperion.git

Testando a segunda conta

git clone git@github.com-code-041:code-041/code041.git

Pronto, agora temos duas contas do Github usando chaves ssh diferentes.
Espero ter ajudado!!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm Olga or Olya, I was born and raised in Ukraine where I graduated with a degree in computer science in 2012. However, I have never worked as a programmer, "thanks" to some of my professors and friends who ruined my self-esteem, confidence, etc.. They did it so effectively that I was terrified to even attempt it, after which I stopped looking in that direction :(
I immigrated to the US in October 2019 and left behind everything I had. I am grateful to my husband who was able to, step by step, give me confidence and break the wall with all those stereotypes that fettered and limited me. After a while I realized that I want to pursue a career as a software engineer. However, since I obtained my degree in another country and never used those skills, I feel like I am coming into tech field as a newbie. I know that the world of technology always changes very rapidly, and I missed many years of knowledge, experience, and changes in this area. With that in mind, I have taken my first step towards getting back on track, and now I am a software engineering student at Flatiron School!
I am happy to be among the passioned and focused people, who are not afraid to change their lives and do what they love. I don't want to lie, it is tough, and I still have 12 weeks of intensive program ahead of me. I am excited and overwhelmed at the same time, sometimes frustrated and definitely tired (thanks again to my husband, he looks after the kids after daycare and cooks while I am on campus or continue studying after the kids go to bed). However, it is rewarded with happiness of getting something to work, with confidence when you passed the test with understanding and when you completed your first project. I believe and hope that I will succeed and I do not want to give up no matter what!]]></summary>

In the world of web development, there are a few different languages you can use to create your websites: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this blog post, we will be focusing on HTML and CSS. 
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the language that is used to create the structure of a website. This includes the headings, paragraphs, and images.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that is used to style the HTML. This includes the font, color, and size of the text, as well as the layout of the website.

What brought about NFT?
NFT became popular due to blockchain technology becoming mainstream. NFT can be any digital assets, artworks, pictures, videos or music. What makes them interesting is that they have unique properties which make it easy to prove ownership.
For example, if you have a picture, let's assume your picture, to make it an NFT, you just have to store it with its attribute on the blockchain. You don't even need to be a programmer or technical person to do this. This can be easily done on  Opensea .
NFTs are quite popular because people are buying and selling it. you may not be able to sell your NFT picture but if you are an artist or a creative, you can make a lot of money listing your creative asset on an NFT marketplace. 
What makes NFT stand out in the blockchain world?
They can be traded across different ecosystems, this means you can view your NFT on different wallets and marketplaces. This is possible due to open standards adopted across the ecosystem.
NFTs are been utilized in various industries.
Opensea  or other platforms
Opulous  as NFTs
AirNFTs  as NFTs
 Axie infinity  game.
Decentraland 
NFT Marketplaces
The most popular one is  Opensea
Others are SuperRare and
Rarible

One of the best uses of Event Sourcing is to manage behaviors between entities, aka relationships. This is where all interesting things happen. For example, a product catalog is just a collection of data.

These relationships need to be reflected somewhere in the event stream. In our domain of safety training, the main activity we track is training. Which involves a student and a course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[洋葱新闻：“Linus 发现 Windows XP 很棒”

Linux 创始人 Linus Torvalds 在 GitHub 上的 Linux 仓库的 README 中写道：“我删除了Linux，因为我讨厌它，现在我认为它很糟糕。你应该去使用这个很棒的操作系统，它叫 Windows XP，我刚刚发现它很棒。”，这个文件的 URL 是 https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/8bcab0346d4fcf21b97046eb44db8cf37ddd6da0 ，没错，看起来是 Linux 的仓库地址。好吧，这是一个洋葱新闻。事实上，这是一个 GitHub 的 bug，任何人都可以通过伪造 URL 而看起来像是另外的仓库和另外的作者。而这个 Bug 由来已久，但是 GitHub 从未准备修复。


老王点评：无论 GitHub 基于什么理由不修复，但是通过这个漏洞可以制作出以假乱真的钓鱼信息，大家一定要注意。




最新版 macOS 12.3 终于移除了 Python 2 的支持

苹果释出了 macOS Monterey 12.3 Beta，一个主要变化是 不再捆绑 Python 2.7。苹果建议开发者使用 Python 3 或替代语言。Python 语言项目在 2020 年 1 月 1 日停止支持 Python 2 分支，接替 Python 2 的 Python 3 早在 2008 年就已经发布，但由于它不向后兼容，导致许多用户仍然停留在 Python 2 分支。但 macOS 也没有预装 Python 3，开发者可选择安装捆绑 Python 3 的 Xcode 开发工具。


老王点评：如果 Python 3 能对 Python 2 提供更多的兼容性，而不是弃之如敝履，就不会有这么多的产品和服务还留在 Python 2。




OpenSea 称其上免费创建的 NFT 80% 都是垃圾或剽窃作品

占有绝对垄断地位的 NFT 市场 OpenSea 宣布，它将限制用户在平台上使用其工具免费创建 NFT 的次数为 50 次。这些免费创建的 NFT 可以跳过支付区块链燃料费用，而在售出时由买家支付。之后在社区的反对之下，OpenSea 又宣布取消这一限制，同时也给出了做此限制的 理由：用这个免费工具创建的项目中，超过 80% 是抄袭作品、虚假收藏和垃圾内容。


老王点评：其实我觉得这种对免费创建的限制是有道理的，要不 OpenSea 可能会沦为垃圾场。]]></summary>

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14224-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-01-29T10:02:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitsy 是一个开源电子游戏设计软件。 其简约的功能使任何人都可以探索他们的创造力。




有许多游戏设计程序和各种游戏设计方法，但对我来说，最突出的是 Bitsy。Bitsy 由 Adam Le Doux 在 2017 年创建，在 MIT 许可下发布，用其创造者的话说，Bitsy 是：“一个用于小游戏或世界的编辑器。其目标是使制作游戏变得容易，在那里你可以四处走动，与人交谈，并到某个地方。”

安装 Bitsy

Bitsy 是用 JavaScript 编写的，可以制作 HTML5 游戏。你可以从 GitHub 或 它的创造者的网站 下载它。它很小，很容易学习，有独特的位图艺术风格，有意在功能上有所欠缺，而且能做的事情有限。

尽管（也许是因为）这些限制，Bitsy 自发布以来吸引了一个充满活力的用户社区。用户对 Bitsy 采取的两个主要方法是：接受限制和寻求突破限制，看看你能走多远。

创意的界限

Bitsy 的局限性意味着接受这些局限性仍能制作出令人满意的游戏，这就成为一个需要创造性和创造力的挑战。你可以在 Itch.io 网站 上看到和玩一些用 Bitsy 制作的令人印象深刻的游戏。同时，人们也想出了一些黑科技、调整和扩展。这些都在不牺牲 Bitsy 的本质的前提下突破了一些限制。

Bitsy 的基本元素是一个代表玩家的头像、发生游戏动作的房间、精灵（可以与之互动的非玩家角色）和物品。有一个用于创建这些元素的位图编辑器，它也支持简单的两帧动画。



在 Bitsy 中工作依赖于条件变量，而不是成熟的脚本，这使得没有编码背景的人容易学习，但有时会让那些期待更多灵活性的人感到沮丧。

如果你想了解 Bitsy 的基本情况，你可以在创作者的网站上了解，或者下载并在本地运行。



文档

关于 Bitsy 的文档并不是只有一个地方可以去看。如果你想看 Bitsy 的操作，可以在 YouTube 上找到各种短视频。我更喜欢基于文本的教程，我发现最有用的三个资源是：


Itch.io 网站上提供的官方 Bitsy 教程，作者是 Claire Morwood

Bitsy workshop PDF， 由用户 haraiva 提供

Bitsy 变量， 教程由用户 ayolland 编写


阅读这些教程，尝试一些 Bitsy 游戏，并开始创造你自己的东西。开始时要保持简单。当你熟悉了 Bitsy，你可能想研究一下人们为它创造的一些 工具、黑科技和扩展。

它也是教育工作者的完美工具，甚至还有教育工作者 Hal Meeks 的 Bitsy 课程 可供在线学习。

你还可以在 Itch.io 网站 上找到人们为 Bitsy 制作的大量游戏资源。

Twine 整合

你可能已经尝试过流行的基于浏览器的游戏开发工具 Twine。你可以将 Bitsy 与 Twine 不同程度地整合。整合的范围可以从简单地将 Bitsy 游戏放在一个 iframe 中显示在你的 Twine 游戏中，到在两个引擎之间共享变量和对话命令，让你在 Bitsy 游戏中执行基本的 Twine 命令！如果你对这些感兴趣，那么请看：


结合 Bitsy 和 Twine 的教程

Bitsy 黑科技

Freya 的 Twisty 模板


给初学者的 Bitsy

初学者很容易入门 Bitsy，无论你是编程新手还是仅仅是游戏设计的新手。有了它，你可以探索它在激发创造力、想象力和创造性方面的所有可能性。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 显然是 Linux 用户中最受欢迎的开源网络浏览器之一。

事实上，它是 可用于 Linux 的最佳网络浏览器 之一。但是，它的附加组件（或扩展组件）如何呢？

考虑到你更喜欢开源的解决方案，你是否在使用开源服务的附加组件？有哪些你可以安装的最好的开源 Mozilla Firefox 附加组件？

你应该尝试的开源 Firefox 扩展程序



需要注意的是，在 Firefox 中并不是每个附加组件都是开源的。

此外，有几个开源项目的 Firefox 附加组件采用了不同的许可证。

1、Dark Reader



Dark Reader 是一个流行的浏览器扩展，让你打开网站的深色模式。该扩展只是简单地改变背景和文本颜色，以融合深色模式主题。

在默认情况下，它与几乎所有网站都能很好地配合。然而，如果你认为深色模式无法阅读（或不好看），你也可以自定义颜色、对比度、亮度和灰度。

你也可以选择在特定的网站上启用它，而在其他网站上禁用它。在这两种情况下，你都可以创建一个网站白名单/黑名单的列表。

它是一个尊重用户隐私的开源项目。你可以在它的 GitHub 页面 中了解更多关于它的信息，或者安装该附加组件来尝试它。

2、Bitwarden



毋庸置疑，这是现有的 最佳密码管理器 之一。

Bitwarden 是一个开源的密码管理器，提供各种功能。它专注于提供有竞争力的开源解决方案。

这个用于 Mozilla Firefox 的密码管理器插件并不亚于任何其他类似产品。你可以通过该扩展获得所有的基本功能，包括生成密码、管理你的保险库以及一些高级选项。

在我的使用场景中，我没有发现这个扩展有任何不足之处。如果你还没有试过，你应该尝试一下这个插件。你可以看看它的 GitHub页面 来了解更多信息。

straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the
internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for
everyone!)
But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One
question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing
them THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?
I asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6
and I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here. These all come
with the disclaimer that I have basically 0 experience with IPv6 so I can’t evaluate these reasons very well.
First though, I want to explain why it’s possible for twitter.com to no…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一个界面中用近似色系中不同的颜色区分不同的功能是界面设计里常用的设计方法，但又有谁想到不同的颜色也会给部分人带来压力呢？前段时间 iMessage 服务在美国因为「蓝色聊天气泡」和「绿色聊天气泡」的设计引发了不小的讨论。

但因为国内的 iMessage 用户不多，所以讨论的人也不多，甚至有不少朋友都不知道这件事。所以我也打算从这个讨论开始和大家一起聊聊 iMessage、RCS 消息以及 5G 消息的特点和不同。
iMessage 的「绿气泡」和「蓝气泡」
最近这轮关于 iMessage 争议的开端，是《华尔街日报》2022 年 1 月 8 日刊登的报道《Apple 的蓝泡泡帝国》（Apple’s Blue Bubble Empire1），这篇报道大致阐述了这样一个观点：「Apple 通过颜色区分普通短信（SMS）消息和 iMessage 消息，目的是使用 Android 手机的美国青少年在社交上倍感压力，让更多的人继续使用 iPhone」。
其实，iMessage 的封闭生态，以及其消息气泡颜色对用户社交关系的潜在影响，在过去已经被讨论过很多次。美国网络语汇中很早就有「green bubble struggle」的说法；三星还曾在 2019 年专门 汇集一组 GIF 动图 揶揄 iMessage 的气泡颜色。但《华尔街日报》以主流大报的身份参与这个话题，确实引发了更为广泛和激烈的讨论。
文章发出后，Google 高级副总裁、Android 团队负责人 Hiroshi Lockheimer 在推特上转发了这篇文章并 评论 道：

Apple 用 iMessage 套牢用户是铁证如山的计谋。作为一家将人性和公平作为核心营销点的公司，利用同辈压力（peer pressure，指因害怕被同伴排挤而放弃自我做出顺应别人的选择——编注）和欺凌销售产品是虚伪的。现有的标准完全可以解决…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that we have a good understanding of how JavaScript setTimeout works to delay a function.
Let's look at how we can perform an action every x time.
This can be super helpful for animating stuff or checking a data feed.
Let's look at how this will work in its most basic form.
setInterval(() => {
  // Run every 100 milliseconds
}, 100);

This function will run every 100 milliseconds.
Often you might want to achieve this to run only until a specific condition is met.
We can clear the interval by using the clearInterval.
const timer = setInterval(() => {
  // Do something
}, 100);

clearInterval(timer);

Or you can even stop it from inside the interval.
const timer = setInterval(() => {
  if (condition) {
    clearInterval(timer);
    return;
  }

  // Execute the function
}, 100);

This is a great way to stop a particular action from running.
When you use setInterval, it does not care how long your function runs.
Meaning it will always start a new loop at the set time.
For example, when you use it to animate, but the animations have different lengths, it might cause weird side-effects where the following animation will start, and the first one isn't even done.

As you can see, each function can have its own time to execute, meaning they can overlap and cause issues.
If you find yourself needing them to wait, using setTimeout might be a better solution.
We can set up a recursive setTimeout function.
const coolFunc = () => {
  // Execute the function

  setTimeout(coolFunc, 100);
};

setTimeout(coolFunc, 100);

Which will result in the following flow.

First instinct would say just change the innerHTML of all <trix-toolbar> elements.
This would work for most simple use cases, but what if you have a lazy-loaded turbo frame? Now you have to listen for when that frame gets loaded and then do some innerHTML replacement there.
It quickly turns into an ever-increasing ball of complexity. When searching through the Trix source code, I came across this function:
Trix.config.toolbar.getDefaultHTML()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你看到了这篇文章，那么恭喜你，你将成为全中国最先了解“维C黄脸”真相的一批人。
关于用了维C为什么脸黄，目前中文互联网上的解释都很牵强。于是我去查了一下文献，发现事实远比想象的复杂。除了脸变黄外，手掌，指甲缝还有手指缝都有可能变黄，这种变黄没法用清洁产品洗掉，只能等皮肤慢慢代谢掉。停用之后，基本上一两个星期，皮肤变黄就会消失，而且你会发现肤色比用之前更提亮了一个色号。
目前中文互联网对于维C变黄的解释很牵强
关于为什么维C上脸之后，有些人会变黄，目前中文互联网的主流说法是维C的氧化。因为一些维C精华放久了之后，会呈现出比较深的颜色。于是自然而然的认为维C上脸之后被氧化，也是染黄皮肤的元凶。但是这过程中，大家常常忽略一个点，那就是维C精华的颜色并没有深到可以染黄皮肤的地步。
我手头正好有一瓶接近保质期的维C精华，大家可以看到颜色非常深。

把精华滴一点到手上，颜色对比非常明显，然而涂开之后，对皮肤的颜色根本没有影响。

这是因为维C氧化之后，颜色虽然会变深，但是真正有颜色的成分非常少。这些成分又都是水溶性的，根本没法染黄我们的皮肤。
用了维C脸黄的元凶竟然是它
为了搞清楚用了维C脸黄的原因，我查找了大量文献，终于找到了合理的解释。维C染黄角质层的元凶其实是维C代谢的产物之一：赤藓酮糖。
看到赤藓酮糖这四个字，你的第一反应一定是：这是什么鬼？

实际上，赤藓酮糖在国外可是个大大有名的成分，它是欧美常用的美黑剂。
和亚洲人不同，欧美人喜欢颜色深的皮肤，这样的人被认为是有钱去海边度假，所以看起来给人感觉比较健康比较美。然而不是所有人都有钱有时间去海边度假，于是国外专门有一类美黑护肤品，而这个赤藓酮糖就是美黑剂的主要成分。它能和角化细胞中的角蛋白结合，形成类黑素，从而让皮肤颜色看起来更深。

由赤藓酮糖来的类黑素并不是黑色的，而是红棕色，当用量较少的时候，看起来就是黄不拉几的颜色。实际上，赤藓酮糖的短期使用效果和维C染黄脸的效果一毛一样！

从维C到赤藓酮糖，鬼知道我经历了什么
维C的氧化是个非常复杂的过程[1]。简单来说，维C（抗坏血酸）先会变成脱氢抗坏血酸。随后脱氢抗坏血酸进一步变成2,3-二酮古洛糖酸。以此为基础，接下来是非常复杂的化学反应，生成的产物也非常多。而赤藓酮糖就是其中的产物之一。

根据实验，一份维C如果氧化降解完全，可以生成至多0.28份赤藓酮糖，这个转化率相当高了。一般欧美使用赤藓酮糖作为美黑剂，这个成分的添加量是5%。所以如果维C精华含有15%的维C，如果全部氧化完全，相当于4.2%的赤藓酮糖，和欧美主流的美黑剂差不多了。
好在现在主流的维C精华都使用各种方式来稳定维C，维C降解不多。上脸之后，如果做好防晒，停留在角质层中的维C被氧化的概率也不太大。产生的赤藓酮糖也就非常少了。
脸黄了怎么办？
很多人用维C明明是为了提亮肤色，结果脸变黄了，郁闷的同时还不免担心起来，染黄的脸洗都洗不掉！
其实用了维C之后脸变黄大可不必焦虑，直接停用维C就是了。停止使用之后，也就缺少了赤藓酮糖的输入，皮肤中也就不会形成类黑素，皮肤就不会继续变黄。
而根据赤藓酮糖的工作原理，它一般只作用于角质层最外层的一些角化细胞。而且我们的皮肤也会正常代谢。随着皮肤的代谢，这些染黄的角化细胞基本上一周就会代谢干净，最长不会超过两周。
如果你又喜欢维C的功效，又不想皮肤变黄，那么还有个办法就是搭配使用一些果酸类的产品。日常使用维C的时候，手指手掌处的染黄会更明显，因为这些地方的角质层更厚，有更多的角蛋白和赤藓酮糖反应。使用一些温和的果酸类产品剥脱角质层，让角质层薄一些，脸黄就不那么明显了。当然，在使用果酸之前，得确保自己皮肤耐受，而且不是敏感肌。


小结一下，用维C脸变黄并不是因为简单的氧化。而是因为维C转化成了赤藓酮糖，而这个成分能和角化细胞结合，形成类黑色素，从而染黄角质层。解决的问题很简单，要么停用维C，脸黄一两周就会消失；要么使用温和的果酸轻微剥脱角质层，减少黄气。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先上图，证明不是吹牛皮，不是纸上谈兵。

这个是半路截的图，中间还有三百多公里是导航到目的地以后又导航到其他的地方的。
那天一大早是准备开车从日照先去烟台轮渡码头上船去大连的，然后开了三百多公里到了烟台码头才被告知整个渤海湾封海了，问多久开，告知三天后。
开玩笑呢？三天后？啥事儿都耽误了。当即决定围着渤海湾画个C到大连。然后买了一整箱蓝瓶红牛。（蓝瓶红牛提神效果比金瓶效果好。）
我跟我同事俩人，他驾驶证刚出实习期，一路上尽量自己开。
前八百多公里感觉还可以，吹着牛皮听着DJ，看着风景还觉得挺惬意。

这是从日照到烟台，一大早拍的，有些雾。



基本上三四百公里左右就得找个服务区休息休息。整个白天基本都是我在开。同事陪我吹牛皮。吹了整个白天。

这个图就是下午太阳快落山了。那时候基本上没有别的牛皮吹了。吹得口干舌燥喝水也不管用那种。感觉话说多了舌头磨的疼。



到了前半夜，高速上小车很少了，基本都是大车。而且对面车道的大车绝对不关远光灯，大老远的照着眼睛睁不开。所以晚上开车速度和效率没有白天高。

整段路程，个人感觉最难熬的时候是最后的三百公里。那个时候精神和精力真的已经灯枯油尽了，肚子感觉鼓鼓的，打个嗝也都是红牛味。也没有话题聊了，相顾无言。听歌听得感觉耳朵呱噪的厉害。主要是风噪胎噪的低频噪音吵的脑仁疼。真没办法了，拜托同事帮忙开一段，自己稍微打个盹。谁知道一坐上副驾驶，嘿，清醒了。这玩意怪得很。
还有还有，京哈高速有一段堵车堵的我都怀疑人生！堵了接近一个小时！是一动不动！一开始我俩还老老实实的在车里干坐着。后来旁边的大车司机都下车溜达了，还有互不认识的大车司机互相交换水果零食啥的，还有蹲在路边嗑瓜子的…我俩就下车跟着吹，才知道经常跑这段路的司机堵车堵出经验了，带着扑克打斗地主。

这图是从烟台里程表清零以后到大连跑的距离。中间加了三箱油，换算一下百公里大概7个半，作为一台排量2.5自吸的车，全程高速油耗感觉并不高。（出了山东以后，基本都是乙醇汽油，尤其是大连，没有纯汽油！不是说乙醇汽油成本低嘛？为啥比纯汽油还要贵！！！而且还不经烧，加满一箱油明显跑的距离比纯汽油短个七八十公里，这是经过实测的。不过尾气的味道比纯汽油好闻。据说是年审测尾气的时候，加乙醇汽油比较容易过。）

这是大连中央大道的梦露～




大连街头的哥斯拉。













大连的景色真的超美，随手一拍就是风景美如画。空气还特别清新。想去旅游的小伙伴强推！而且人都很友好。热心的很。我俩办完事儿往回走的时候真的就是开够了车了，一想起还要跑一千多公里回去心里就打退堂鼓。不死心跑去大连码头一问，回复渤海湾提早开了，我俩高高兴兴兴高采烈的俩人一车上了轮渡。




大轮渡超大！装的下好多车！把车开进船里的时候感觉好神奇。




在船上一觉起来天亮了，跑去甲板上拍海上日出。超美。
一觉起来到了烟台码头了。感觉祖国真的太强大了，坐轮渡比开车真的方便太多了。睡一觉就省下了一千多公里的路程。我俩下了船又从烟台跑回日照。两天时间，跑了两千多公里，感觉就是黄粱一梦，只有里程表上的数字，提醒着我一切都是真实的。整段路程，大概有三百多公里是同事开的，省下的一千六百多是我开的。也由衷的佩服那些长期开大货车跑长途的司机师傅。
长途开车，调整一个最适合自己的坐姿真的超级重要！还要买一个那种护颈，要不脖子真的感觉又酸又痛。还要尽量备点热水和茶叶。不能光喝饮料，还是热水最解渴茶水最提神。尽量买点黄瓜和水果啥的，这样没牛皮吹了吃点水果还提神，高速服务区上又贵又不好吃。车况也一定要检查好。油水气电的。还有轮胎胎压。
还有还有还有！之前定速巡航基本上感觉用处不大，上了高速才知道定速巡航有多重要！尤其是长途高速！完全解放右脚！而且还省油！没错，是超省油！轻松太多了！！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在今年的新年节日主题中，Apple 为我们带来了一个全新的活动：用 Keynote 制作一张贺卡送给亲友。在 Apple 提供的新年贺卡模板里，大胆地运用了多种色彩和元素，颇有「波普风格」的味道，十分具有艺术感。

不过转念一想，我还是为 Apple 捏了把汗：这些设计用来送给年轻的「亚逼」1朋友或许非常适合，但如果要送给家中长辈或年纪较小的孩子，就显得有些过于浮夸了。考虑到农历新年的主要氛围还是热烈的红色，所以我们不妨通过自己动手，在 Keynote 上来制作一张属于自己的贺卡。
或许你会觉得，「设计」本身就是一个比较复杂的东西，面对着一张空白的画板，不知道要做点什么。不用担心，这一次其实不需要太多美术功底，只要你有一个相对好一些的审美，就能够在网上找到合适的素材，一点一点将它拼出你心目中的样子。
对了，如果你觉得新年与「红色」的相关性是刻板印象，你也可以选择一个你喜欢的颜色。
尺寸设定
如今，纸质的贺卡已经逐渐被排版优美和展现形式多样的电子贺卡所取代，所以很可能我们不会将设计好的贺卡打印出来，而是通过社交媒体来传播。考虑到如今最贴近人身边的屏幕依然还是手机，因此建议还是将贺卡的版面调整为手机竖版。
与此同时，当今大部分手机都已经是全面屏，因此最好不要用 9:16 的画面比例，而是采用 18:9 这样的比例来制作，尽量利用好屏幕的显示空间，营造更浓烈的氛围感。此外还要注意，不少全面屏的四角和顶部空间都是不可用的，在制作时记得不要在这些地方摆放重要元素，避免被遮挡，这些区域在设计上被称为「安全区外的空间」。
记得把内容放在安全区域内
当然啦，横版的贺卡也不是不行，不过如果是横版的话，建议可以添加一些精美的动画效果，然后导出成视频，增加互动的同时，也能带来更多乐趣。
如果你有心，还可以制作两个版本。两个版本在本质上不会太难，只需要将一些元素重新排布即可。
风格和元素
确定好了…]]></summary>

Running native code with flutter is accomplished by sending messages using a defined platform channel. Using the MethodChannel the flutter app sends and receives messages from the host platform (iOS / Android).
Method calls are encoded into binary before being sent, and binary results received are decoded into Dart values. The data sended through the channel is converted like in the following table:

Messages and responses are passed asynchronously but the channels method needs to be invoked in the main thread. Because of this the main thread can jank if the method takes too long to compute, this might be mitigated by sending messages in different threads in the backend more on that …]]></summary>

Hello! On this day I will continue the series little design system with Figma. Today I will share how to create components and color palette.
Working with UI elements as components gives us many advantages when we have to reuse them in our design.

We can edit the shape's properties in the right panel.

In my case, this shapes are color swatches, they include color, contrast ratio, hexadecimal code, name and a dot for distinction.

It's a good practice sets auto layout behavior to main parts of our shape.

The Auto Layout option allows you to structure components or frames in such a way that they can grow automatically, making a container adapt to the size of its…]]></summary>

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any easy way to run Turbo Pascal on modern hardware, so I'll do the next best thing and give Free Pascal a try.
Pascal code starts with program Name. Statements are separated by ; and the whole thing with .. It's case insensitive, so you can do writeln, WriteLn, or even WrItElN if you wanted, but I'll stick to all lowercase.
program Hello;
begin
  writeln('Hello, World!');
end.

$ fpc hello.pas
$ ./hello
Hello, World!

Let's try something a bit more ambitious - Fibonacci numbers.
program Fibonacci;

function fib(n:integer):integer;
begin
  if n<=2 then
    fib := 1
  else
    fib := fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been building an open source accounting system as a COVID project which is designed to give programmers the features they expect so that they can automate their financials. These include RPC endpoints so you can communicate to the system with your scripts, and control over the SQL database so you can analyse your financials using your business analytics tool of choice.
I've also very recently developed a Web GUI frontend for the system so you can do basic interactions with the system. The demo for this can be seen here:
https://youtu.be/19moSl4YFeI
Ideally the project will give people all the features you need to fully automate your financials from start to finish. Next up on the roadmap is to build in bank feeds and reconciliations. Then aiming build in cryptocurrency gains calculations.
Would love to hear what people think about it!

An app built with .NET is high-code. I don't mean that .NET isn't elegant or libraries don't exist to help. Rather when you write a .NET app your primary focus is on writing code to make the app work.
Both are incredibly powerful ways to build applications.
And when you mix Power Apps with .NET - your productivity can go through the roof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Batch Files, with extension .bat, were DOS equivalent of shell scripts.
DOS version (still used by DOSBox) was extremely limited, and couldn't even add numbers. Starting with OS/2 and Windows NT, .bat files were extended with some very rudimentary scripting capabilities, so that's what we'll be doing today, but I'll limit my use of these extended features to just set /a for math.
You can run these examples on any Windows machine. Due to set /a they won't work on a DOSBox, or on a DOS machine if you somehow still have one.
We can start by writing hello.bat:
echo Hello, World!

Unfortunately it does a very annoying thing, and echos every command before executing it. That's fine for debugging, but not really what we want most of the time:
C:\> hello

C:\> echo Hello, World!
Hello, World!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forth language is dead, and its ideas never saw much adoption into the mainstream languages, but Forth-style languages pop up every now and then, without ever getting much traction.
One of such languages has been Factor. Let's see how it improves upon Forth.
You can brew install factor, but it won't be in your path, instead it installs to a weird place.
There's also unrelated factor on Linux machines that factorizes numbers:
$ factor 420
420: 2 2 3 5 7

Anyway, Factor. The first annoying issue is that a fresh Factor program comes with no library of any kind. No print, no +, literally nothing.
If we try this:
#!/Applications/factor/factor

"Hello, World!" print

We get this error:
$ ./hello.factor
./hello.factor

3: "Hello, World!" print
                        ^
No word named “print” found…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The law is code that is interpreted by Judges. My wife is a lawyer and tells me this. In this view, amendments or reinterpretations of laws by higher courts are diffs.
I'm not really up on Web3, but this take is wrong somehow.
@kelseyhightower I would rather trust code (which is verifiable and proved) than law that are interpreted
    
And not just in the funny way that many languages run in an interpreter:
twitter.com/xameyz/status/…
    
But in the fact that laws being interpreted by a person is the point of the legal system. It's why it works.
The fact that a judge gets to consider the specifics of your particular case and make a decision that takes those into account makes the legal system work.
In cases where the law is interpreted absolutely, like three-strikes-you're-out laws or mandatory minimums, sentences are usually the places where things turn out badly.
Explicit coded rules are bad at handling exceptional cases, and the real world is messy. People can enforce the spirit of the law and not just the letter of the law. 
On the other hand, the existing legal system is slow and expensive ( but almost no contracts are actually resolved in court, it's usually only the messy cases with the exceptions that end up in court). 
So, where do coded contracts make sense (Any ethereum people around) ?]]></summary>

For years, Netatmo's online shop was running on Magento 1, and it "worked" sufficiently for the time. Between the years of technical debt as a result of numerous developers and agencies working on it, and the upcoming EOL for Magento 1 support, it was quickly becoming obvious that an upgrade was due for the shop.
One of the most challenging parts of any project - what technology stack do we want to use!?
We decided to stick with Magento, moving to v2, for a number of reasons. The migration from M1 to M2 should be easier than from Magento…]]></summary>

RTX 3050采用的是3060一样的GA106核心，但流处理器数量从3584缩到了2560.安培架构每个SM有128个FP32单元，就是说SM数量从28组缩减到20组。

RTX 3060的GA106屏蔽了2组SM,而3050就是屏蔽了10个SM，就是一组GPC的规模。
完整的GA106有3个GPC，一共30组SM，其实照理RTX 3050的规格2组GPC就可以满足，笔记本的3050就是2GPC的GA107，2048流处理器单元，满规格的GA107是3072，其实用来做2560的桌面RTX 3050冗余也很大，良率也应该不会有问题，这样成本会低很多。

我们本次测试的是微星 GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X 8G OC，简单的说就是万图师2风扇丐版。由于带个OC,Boost频率比标准的略高一点，但功耗是锁死的，最高130W，如果是STRIX这样的高规格，则可以再向上拉10%。


双风扇、两热管，对于130W的TDP而言绰绰有余。

输出的接口是标准的DPx3+1 HDMI。

万图师祖传的塑料背板，实际PCB比俩风扇的散热器还短上一截。

单8pin供电，130W功耗一般搭配足额质量过硬的400W电源就可以满足需求，并有一定的余量。

PCIe引脚看上去是完整的，但实际上是8X 4.0的速率。虽然这个影响不至于象PCIe 4.0 4x的6500XT那样明显，但引用Tom's Hardware的测试，在部分游戏中还是会有一定的损失。

从广州到武汉全程1000公里，不过我们不是自己“开车”而是全程导航辅助驾驶回去的，虽说是辅助驾驶，但是你以为你就可以躺在驾驶位安心睡大觉了？真实体验比自己开车还要累很多倍。下面给大家看看这次作死全过程：
大家正在紧锣密鼓地准备中11日8时10分


正在出发前的动员大会：首先要确保安全11日9时00分

我们将对辅助驾驶系统的托管表现进行严格的手动计量，周师兄正在检查量表：

正在检查路上要用到的拍摄设备，以便有一个全方位可回放的素材库：

6台车陆续发车：武汉见11日9点30分
正式出发！六台车特斯拉Model 3、蔚来ES8、小鹏P7、理想ONE、摩卡、Aion V Plus陆续从广州天河区高普路出发，1000公里后的武汉见。谁能率先到达呢？

测试车辆已经陆续上了广州龙洞高速路口，现在看到路口车辆已经开始有点堵了：

吉吉老师向同事打出了友爱的招呼：

理想ONE进隧道时退出了辅助驾驶11日9点52分
本次挑战，我们尽可能全程开启车辆的辅助驾驶系统。出发没多久，上高速后的理想ONE辅助驾驶出现了人工接管的提示。

在开放路况行驶时，小鹏P7的辅助驾驶保持良好运行：


不出意外，蔚来ES8上的雨丝，刚上车就进入了深度睡美人状态：

就在雨丝还在睡梦中时，隔壁埃安V Plus的辅助驾驶出现了不稳定的情况，车辆摇摆、加塞刹车不及时。同行车辆还发现埃安V PLUS常在车距很大的位置亮起刹车灯。我们怀疑和雨丝不稳定的梦境有关。
BTW，我们每台车都用同事通过量表记录每台车的辅助驾驶托管次数。

京港澳高速已经出现堵车情况11日10点21分
出现堵车情况，Model 3驾驶员罗老师出现急躁情绪，开始骂脏话。这里劝诫大家：安全第一，快慢其次！开车不要代入情绪，不要有怒路症。

目前的车辆基本还集中在一条路线上：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[提升驾车舒适度，那必须是全程辅助驾驶啊；爽不爽不用我说了吧（微笑~）
不过大家对自动辅助驾驶还是有很深的顾虑，毕竟这东西可是人命关天马虎不得。为了验证现阶段自动辅助驾驶技术发展到什么地步了，我们前阵子集齐了市面上所有具备驾驶辅助的车，从广州开到武汉，6台车1000公里真实路况测试。
先贴测试结果：

经过一千公里极限测试，老朋友特斯拉Model 3、蔚来ES8、小鹏P7总体保持了先发优势。
特斯拉NoA作为第一个接触到的领航辅助功能，依然在执行表现的拟人化程度上处于领先身位，也是本次测试中最接近人类驾驶、且支持自主变道远离桩桶的车型。
蔚来ES8、小鹏P7近一年的迭代升级非常明显，两者都不如Model 3那般果决，但是相比早期版本来说已经积极许多，两者的风格都相对折中，对于加塞车辆的识别以及避让成功率都比较高，特别注意的是在高精地图加持下能够在执行指令、特殊路况前进行相应的语音、仪表显示，本地化工作肯定要好上许多，驾驶员感觉安心许多。我们认为小鹏P7对于高精地图依赖更为明显，迫切需要解决高精地图覆盖率；而ES8需要提升变道时的预判能力；





其他三位“新选手”这次为我们带来更多惊喜，理想NOA导航辅助驾驶系统相比其它车型时间推送是最晚的，刚刚在一个多月前正式推送，虽然现阶段领航辅助风格非常保守，但是胜在可用性较高，在不能胜任的路段也会积极提示驾驶员及时接管，即便领航辅助占比有所降低，但是这样的策略我们认为是对安全性更有裨益，希望接下来能够提升指令执行效率，让变道稍稍积极一些。





最后来看AION V PLUS以及摩卡， AION V PLUS相对保守，因此较少出现变道出错以及危险境况，整体风格平稳，但是在复杂环境中受影响非常明显，多次出现车道保持稳定性欠佳，“S形”前进、退出领航辅助驾驶的情况；摩卡则略感性格分裂，白天颇为稳重，主动变道不算积极，但是夜间策略又过于激进，虽然总体可用度较高，但出现受摄像头强光干扰退出领航等“小状况”，我们认为，AION V PLUS以及摩卡均需要提升领航辅助状态保持的稳定性。





适度分忧才是领航辅助的正确打开方式
完成1000公里穿越后，必须坦言我们凭借经验丰富的测试员完成了这次非同寻常的冒险，为了安全考虑，郑重不推荐用户在极端路况中全程使用领航辅助驾驶。
同时，我们更有幸能通过“春运长距离挑战”的形式见证行业的快速发展，我们无法预测一年后、两年后还会增加多少款车型，测试多远的距离，但能够明确的是这条路自此已经不再孤单，一路将有领航辅助分忧相伴。





首先，从测试结果来看，我们惊喜的发现，现阶段智能领航辅助已经不再是纯电动车、新势力的专属，势必会有越来越多的车企、车型覆盖这一功能，从2019年到2022年，我们挑战春运的关注点从“能否抵达”变为了“如何抵达”。事实上这6款车型的智能领航辅助功能在常规路段已足够堪用，导航辅助时长占比最高达到91.73%，这样的结果，我们出发前无论如何也没有想到。





其次，我们建议在保证驾驶员注意力的前提下，尝试使用领航辅助驾驶功能，在长距离重复性行驶过程中，领航辅助驾驶功能能够一定程度上缓解驾驶疲劳与拥堵焦虑，目前而言，适度分忧才是领航辅助驾驶的正确打开方式。
最后，经过场景还原与理论分析，我们发现领航辅助在大多数人工接管中都与传感器、算力边界呈强正相关，有理由相信，未来在提升激光雷达、高算力智能驾驶芯片等硬件边界后，领航辅助驾驶感受一定会变得更好。





领航辅助一定是移动出行的未来吗？对此，我们无法立即给出肯定的答案，能够确定的是，经过数年的求索与守望，我们始终惊诧于这个行业蝶变的速度，或许，无限进步才是这个行业永远的未来，你说是吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在几年前下定决心告别 Windows 上的 xx 大师、xx 卫士后，在一段时间内我会感到些许不适。倒不是因为不习惯没有人告诉我开机花了几分几秒，而是这些无所不包的管家们的确能提供一些特别好用的小工具，比如解除文件占用、右键编辑、广告弹窗拦截等等。
好在后来我发现这些小功能可以用一些更简单纯净的应用来实现。本文介绍的就是我搜集到的一些工具，它们绝大部分为便携软件，无需安装、点开即用，体积也非常小巧，大都保持在几 MB 内。
需要说明的是，因为功能场景和所应对的需求特殊，本文提到的大部分应用都会访问系统内核、修改注册表或某些关键文件，因而可能会被一些安全软件误认为是病毒，保证下载来源正规的前提下需要手动将它们添加进白名单。另外，使用前也请做好备份以防万一。
OpenArk：快速定位快捷键和文件占用
相关链接：GitHub | 文档
Windows 应用可以注册两类快捷键：适用于特定线程的快捷键 和 全局快捷键，前者只有当特定窗口被激活时才会响应，而后者则全局生效。当某应用注册的全局快捷键和其他程序调用的按键冲突，应用功能就会异常。
想要知道究竟是哪个应用占用了快捷键，可以打开 OpenArk，进入 内核 > 系统热键 界面，然后选择 进入内核模式。

此时应用会列出已注册的全局快捷键供我们搜索。譬如说，我们需要知道哪个应用占用了 Ctrl + Alt + Up（注意输入顺序），可以在界面下方的过滤器拦中输入相应的快捷键名称，不难发现是网易云音乐注册了此按键组合。接下来，在网易云中做修改即可解除占用状态。

与快捷键被占用的情况类似，我们偶尔也会遇到某些文件无法打开，无法删除的情形。这大概率是因为该文件正在被其他应用使用。OpenArk 同样为此情况提供了解决方案：进入 内核 > 存储管理界面，选择 进入内核模式，键入文件路径，点击查看占用，应用便会展示所有使用了该文件的进程。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国电视剧发展史
起步
1958 年北京电视台《一口菜饼子》开播，宣告中国电视事业的起步，在此后的二十年间，电视剧承载了对民众教化的作用，因而主角也都是伟光正的形象，没有太多娱乐性，更多以教育为主。
八九十年代
八十年代，中国电视剧开始探索类型剧，这个时期产出的数量虽然不多，但创造了许多在今天看来仍然值得细品的经典作品，如由四大名著改编的电视连续剧《红楼梦》《西游记》，还有由中国神话故事改编的《济公》《聊斋》《封神榜》等，可以说部部经典。这一时代的影视从业者们对电视剧的品质把关极为严格，不计成本，力求完美，1988 年版的《西游记》，短短二十五集却拍了六年，有这样较真的团队，呈现的作品就理所当然地霸占了 80、90 后们的暑假时间和童年回忆。同一时期，香港和台湾也向内地输送了非常多的优秀经典作品如《新白娘子传奇》，为内地电视剧的创作提供了不少经验。

九十年代则是在八十年代的探索上继续发扬光大，经过借鉴和融合，创造了一批质量上乘的类型剧，《编辑部的故事》填补了中国电视喜剧的空白，《我爱我家》则作为情景喜剧的开山之作，成为情景喜剧的行业标杆。1990 年，现象级经典电视剧《渴望》播出，它讲述了一个一生充满艰难和辛苦的平凡女职工的故事，这部电视剧有多火爆呢，说是全中国都急切等在电视机前追更都一点不为过，收视率到了 90.78%，公安部还因为「播出期间犯罪率下降了百分之三十」，专门举行了庆功会，对剧组进行表彰，剧组因此拿到了公安部颁发的维护社会治安奖，这部作品的成功也让我国现实主义题材的影视剧进入到一个新的时代。

此外，《雍正王朝》《末代皇帝》等历史剧、《便衣警察》《永不瞑目》等刑侦剧以及《过把瘾》《一场风花雪月的事》等爱情剧也开始大量涌现代表作， 1998 年播出的《还珠格格》从此解锁了宫斗剧......中国电视剧在刑侦、伦理、军旅、武侠、言情、历史等各个类型上…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[年前有一些地区疫情反复，为了避免疫情的影响进一步扩大，很多人会选择不回家过年，包括我。这是我离家求学这么多年以来第一次在外过年，前几天考完试之后，我就开始购买留校过年所需要的东西；而在群里和其他少数派作者聊到这一话题时，大家也各自推荐一些可能用得到的东西，如果你也有想推荐的产品欢迎大家在评论区分享以及讨论。
一个人过年也要保护好自己
因为疫情仍然没有完全结束，所以在春节期间，保护好自己，做好防护仍旧是非常重要的。所以在我的购物清单里，最首要的就是防护用品。
口罩
我们普通人做好防护一般首先考虑的就是口罩。在疫情严重的情况下，几乎所有公共场合都要求戴上口罩进入。而过年期间，很多超市以及卖口罩的药店会放假关门，所以提前购买好口罩是非常必要的。
之前，可以做防护的外科口罩和N95口罩都一般是蓝色或者白色，几乎没有任何装饰方面的设计和效果。但是随着口罩需求的稳定，很多厂商开始考虑在口罩上设计多样化的图案，来吸引顾客。比如我之前买的小王子、玉桂狗口罩等等。春节之前很多口罩厂商推出了春节主题相关的口罩，又可以保护自己，又能起到装饰效果。当然，很多N95的口罩依然保持简约的设计。

我派作者 @Xavier Wang 还对比了多款不同的口罩，并对数据整理后制成表格方便大家按需挑选：

太长不看版： 对大脸佩戴体验比较友好的是袋鼠医生（亚都实业）的口罩与致净的鱼嘴型口罩。袋鼠医生 外观、拆解，鱼嘴型口罩 外观、拆解。
消毒湿巾
由于近期出现了接触国际包裹而感染新冠的病例，所以对于日常消毒要更加在意，尤其是收到快递包裹之后。买消毒湿巾就是为了可以加强日常的消毒和防护措施，在拆快递之后拿消毒湿巾擦拭可以降低病毒的传播风险。
常见的消毒湿巾有多抽装，也有单片分装的。前者适合在家中消毒使用，因为抽取便利，要大量使用时就会比较方便 。但是这种因为本身重量较重，不利于随身携带。而单片分装由于每一片都是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国人似乎都要过两个年，而这个春节更重要一些。
岁尾，上班的最后一天，办公室非常冷清，我呢，在这敲下这行话。
似乎很久没有随意记录一下心情了，项目关注的人多了，乱写一通难免畏首畏尾，所以正式的内容多了些，而我这个博客的初衷本身就是记录自己的流水账啊，所以想写就写吧。
这两年心态发生了很多变化，好的方面坏的方面，尤其是去年最好的朋友之一选择自己结束生命，总觉得有些不真实，像是有些东西从我的生命中抽走了，再也回不来，想回沈阳看看的时候，少了件事儿，而我们共同的朋友也仿佛约好了一样，不去提起这件事，不去提起他。
新冠两年，科比也走了两年，仿佛这两年很多东西都被抽走，在儿子出生前，和媳妇约好带他出国到日本去玩，结果现在儿子连辽宁都没出过，更可怕的是，我们不知道新冠会持续多久，但大家内心可能都知道，我们再也回不去曾经的生活了吧？
去年做了不少事儿，但总觉得还不够，飞逝的时光，新年到了，这种新年的感觉体现在，超市一排一排的大礼包，酒，坚果。新年到了，虎年来了。
去享受最好的，也准备着随时承受最坏的
想跑马拉松，上一次跑是 19 年的北马了吧，那是我第一次真正意义跑完的马拉松，冲过终点的时候略有遗憾，差一点点进 4 小时，希望下一年有所突破，一下子到了今天。
想把自己曾经的想法都去实现了，想再给自己 10 年，看看未来如何，希望自己别变得油腻，别当爹，跟推上那些闪着光的少年多学习，多玩好玩的东西，让自己的心态变得平和。
想回到从前的身材
想把曾经想读的原版书都读了
想变成一个靠谱的丈夫，一个靠谱的父亲
想多分享，多帮助别人
想多写些文章，特别是技术方面的
想多爬几座山，多跑几个城市
想祝大家虎年愉快，都去乘风破浪
写到这儿吧]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[量子计算机距离破解 BTC 加密还差百万级

量子计算机可借助量子的特性来加速某些计算，科学家们正在研究“到底需要多大规模的量子计算机”才能攻破 BTC 网络。他们发现，如果将破解 BTC 加密的时间窗口限制在 BTC 网络的出块时间 10 分钟，将需要动用规模达到 19 亿个量子比特的超级计算机。但若放宽到半小时，就只需要动用具有 1300 万个量子比特的量子计算机。IBM 创纪录的超导量子计算机，目前也只达成了 127 个量子比特。而将量子比特扩大百万倍，看起来在十年内不大可能做到。


老王点评：即便量子计算机真的发展到那么强大，也有比破解 BTC 更重要的事情要做。




可以训练 AI 的 AI

深度神经网络在 10 年前开始超越传统算法，这是因为我们终于有了足够的数据和处理能力来充分利用它们。训练神经网络需要仔细调整数百万甚至数十亿的参数值，这些参数是这些网络的特征，目标是为它们找到近乎理想的值，这个过程被称为优化，但训练网络并不容易。科学家们构建了一种“超网络”以 加快训练过程，即训练神经网络的神经网络。给出一个为某些任务设计的新的、未经训练的深度神经网络，超网络可以在几分之一秒内预测出新网络的参数，理论上可以使训练不再必要。


老王点评：虽然还不是最可怕的情况，但是这无异于给了 AI 一种自我进化的能力。




影响 12 年来所有 Linux 发行版的本地提权漏洞

Polkit 是一个 SUID 程序。它被默认安装在每个主要的 Linux 发行版中。任何普通用户都可以通过利用其默认配置中的这个 漏洞，在有漏洞的计算机上获得完全的 root 权限。这个漏洞自 2009 年 5 月创建以来一直存在，即使 polkit 守护程序本身没有运行，它也可以被利用。


老王点评：其实 Linux 世界中这种早期潜伏的危险应该还不少，因为那时候 Linux 显然没现在这么重要。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revolt 是一个有前途的自由开源的 Discord 替代品。在这里，让我们看一下它所提供的东西以及它的初步印象。


Discord 是一个功能丰富的协作平台，主要为游戏玩家量身定做。尽管你可以在 Linux 上毫无问题地使用 Discord，但它仍然是一个专有解决方案。

你可以选择使用 Element 作为一个开源的解决方案协作平台，但它不是一个替代品。

但是，Revolt 是一个令人印象深刻的 Discord 替代品，它是开源的。


注意：

Revolt 正处于公开测试阶段，不提供任何移动应用。它可能缺乏一些你在 Discord 上找到的基本功能。


我会重点说一下 Revolt 的功能，以及它是否可以成为 Linux 上 Discord 的替代品。

一个你可以自行托管的开源 Discord 替代品



Revolt 不仅仅是一个简单的开源替代品，而且你还可以自我托管。

它确实缺少 Discord 提供的各种功能，但你可以获得许多基本功能，可以先体验一下。

即使缺乏一些功能，但它也是一个功能丰富的开源客户端。让我们来看看现有的功能。

Revolt 的功能



它看起来和感觉已经很像 Discord，这是一些关键的亮点：


能够创建你自己的服务器

创建文字频道和语音频道

在服务器中分配用户角色

调整主题（深色/浅色）

改变强调色

从可用选项中管理字体和表情包

支持自定义 CSS

能够添加机器人

易于管理文本/语音频道的权限

向其他用户发送朋友请求

保存的笔记

能够控制通知

支持硬件加速

专门的桌面设置

使用 Docker 进行自我托管

用户状态和自定义状态支持


因此，作为处于公开测试阶段的东西，它听起来对初学者来说非常好。你已经拥有了大部分的核心功能，但你可能想等着看它成为一个成熟的 Discord 替代品。

使用 Revolt 的初步印象



如果你使用过 Discord，用户体验会感觉很熟悉。这是一件好事。

对于这篇快速亮点介绍，我没有比较 Discord 和 Revolt 的资源使用情况，因为它仍然处于测试阶段，不是同等级的比较。

然而，在我简短的测试中，它感觉很快速，除了第一次加载一个文本频道时。在发表这篇文章时，它没有双因素认证（2FA）功能，但应该会在他们的第一个里程碑（第一版）版本中添加。



一些功能如用户状态、权限管理和外观调整看起来很有用。但是，当涉及到语音频道时，它和 Discord 的工作方式不一样，至少现在是这样。

我不知道他们是否打算用同样的方式，但 Discord 的语音频道功能是直观的、快速的，而且有更好的控制。

不要忘了，Discord 还提供 “Discord Stage”，这是一个类似 Clubhouse 的音频聊天室功能。

其他一些我找不到的功能包括：


对信息作出反应的能力

抑制噪音的功能

改变服务器

服务器日志

各种有用的机器人


当然，要赶上 Discord 提供的功能还需要大量的时间，但至少我们现在有一个开源的 Discord 解决方案。

你可以了解他们的 项目路线图/发布跟踪器，看看你可以在其最终/未来的版本中期待什么。

在 Linux 中安装 Revolt

Revolt 可用于 Linux 和 Windows。你可以选择在你的网络浏览器上使用它，而不需要一个单独的应用。

但是，如果你需要在你的桌面上使用它，他们提供了一个 AppImage 文件和一个 deb 包，你可以从它的 GitHub 发布页 下载。

如果你是 Linux 的新手，可以参考我们关于 使用 AppImage 文件 和 安装 deb 包 的资源来开始学习。

如果你想用你的错误报告和建议来帮助他们改进，请随时前往 反馈页面。此外，你还可以浏览他们的 GitHub 页面 以了解更多信息。


Revolt


你觉得 Revolt 怎么样？你认为它有可能成为 Linux 上 Discord 的一个很好的开源替代品吗？

请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法!

「卡片笔记写作法」用久了，你总会遇到一个问题，就是卡片太多。
这一方面是个效率问题。你要是想把卡片笔记当成严肃的工具，那么底层就得用数据库来组织信息，而非文件系统。Logseq 目前正在做这种迁移。在卡片少的时候，这二者的效率看不出差别，甚至文件组织方式因为直观显得更加友好。但是卡片到了 10 万级别的时候，效率的差别就会显现。效率不达标，随便查找个东西，你都能感受到「卡」。
以我个人的 Roam Research 数据统计为例。虽然「页面」（Page）只有 1 万多，但是别忘了 Roam Research 下的真正卡片单位，是按「块」（block）来计算。

Roam Research 里 Page 的真正含义是什么呢？我觉得是「盒子」，卡片盒嘛。虽不是物理意义上的盒子，有固定形态，但它确实是承载卡片的容器。在 Roam Research 中，如果你的链接都在页面层级，而不是块引用（block reference），那么你其实并没有发挥出它「细粒度」的特性。
效率问题，还只是一个方面。更要命的，是卡片数量庞大之后，你会忘记自己曾经记过某些东西。本文主要讨论的，便是这个恼人的事儿。
最近，「合桃派」团队邀请医学博士 Lan 分享自己的块引用实践。她结合 Cite to write 和 Roam Untangled 两门课程里的方法，利用块引用自底向上构造「问题」，然后用「问题」…]]></summary>

既然我的老家离市中心本就不近，而我在成年之后又离开了重庆，所以这个2018年拍摄的20分钟的纪录片，既是我这重庆半土著的自白书；也权当我带你去看那山城在我心里的一半风景吧！
宜下班、躺在沙发上、点起外卖、慢慢看～
前方重庆，本次导航结束！魔幻交通、穿楼轻轨、过江索道，勒些网红打卡地都不能代表重庆


我出生在长江边上的一个小县城，这个小县城有个很随便的名字，叫【鱼洞】。
鱼洞的老城区位于重庆城区以南，长江的上游，是个少有外人打扰，安安稳稳的小地方。

【鱼洞】这名字听似随意，现在细细品来，倒是很具有山城人民直白个性的——因为就是以前这里江底有个洞，洞里面很多鱼，就叫做了【鱼洞】，明明很爽快是不是！？

但记得上高中时，班上曾转学来了俩渝中区的同学（俗称城里人），一问我家在哪儿，老实憨厚的我说家在【鱼洞】，她俩就笑了，说：这名字好土哦~鱼洞~~嘿嘿嘿~~~（我现在脑袋里都回响着这笑声）随即周围的同学都笑了。
我那时候脸皮薄，红着脸抬头一看，发现只有一个文静女生没有笑，她低着头坐在一边假装看着书......刹那间我就觉得她是有内涵的，是个有深度且不一样的女同学。
后来经过一盘问，人家女孩子才羞答答地把头抬了起来，怯生生地说了一句：我家.....我家....我家在...【木洞】......
我硬是没忍住，也跟着笑了。
【木洞】在【鱼洞】下游，源于那里有个山洞，传说洞中藏有鲁班的优质木材而得名，明明也很爽快是不是？

鱼洞这个县城在我小时候，远没有你现在看到的这么大，它和中国其他地区的城乡结合部一样，生活在这里的小镇居民都是在自得其乐，安安静静的生活。

也可能是因为这里有条宽阔的大江和奔流不止的江水，所以不管是在菜市场卖菜的农民，还是在街上凭手艺吃饭的师傅，亦或者厂里上班的职工——那时…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[太长不看版：
如果发现加班成瘾让工作、家庭、生活满意度降低和身心健康状况变差，可以适时的做一些调整，比如把分给工作的时间试着分给家人、朋友，或者分给一些活动，比如“游泳健身了解一下”。
希望你可以更好的权衡工作和生活，发自内心的工作投入，并乐在其中；而不是强迫性的、“应该的”去工作，去“内卷“。

三千字长文带你深度了解加班成瘾（详细版）：

首先，你真的是加班成瘾吗？
判断自己是不是加班上瘾，先问问自己这几个问题（心理学标准）：


1、 你会想着如何找出更多时间工作
2、你会花费比预期还多的时间工作
3、你工作，是为了降低罪恶感、焦虑、无助及忧郁
4、别人曾劝你减少工作量，但你不予理会
5、如果不准你工作，会让你很有压力
6、会因为工作而牺牲嗜好、休闲活动及运动
7、工作过量使健康受影响


以上是挪威卑尔根大学心理学家安卓森博士（Cecilie Schou Andreassen）研发的量表，专门测量工作成瘾。如果上面 4 项以上的描述，你的答案是经常、总是，那么你可能就是真的病态的“工作成瘾”。


可能有人会有这样的疑惑：爱工作、多挣钱还不好吗？其实真得还分两个方面看。


当我们说一个人“沉迷工作，无法自拔”，我们多半是表达一种对其热爱工作、献身工作的羡慕或崇拜。
但当我们说一个人是“工作狂”时，却是觉得ta虽然花大量时间努力工作，但对工作投入过多，已经影响到正常生活。
两者相差甚远，却又似乎只有一线之隔。





概念区分：沉迷工作还是工作狂？


“沉迷工作”和“工作狂”两个称呼，在心理学研究中一开始都用工作沉迷(Workaholism) 这一个词来加以描述。就像我们生活中见过的工作狂们“狂”点各不相同，早期的研究中研究者们对工作沉迷的定义也很多样。


一些研究者偏向“沉迷工作派”，认为工作沉迷源于享受工作，因而对人有益，比如沉迷工作的人往往有更高的工作满…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[程序员离不开命令行，许多经典命令是每天必用的，比如ls和cd。
虽然它们很好用，但是由于历史原因，往往也有一些缺点，比如用法不符合直觉、难以配置，有些速度也不快。
这些年，它们的替代品开始出现，而且越来越多，大家开始尝试使用现代语言，重新实现这些经典命令。本文总结一下这些替代品，其中有些真的很不错，值得你在自己的计算机上安装。

一、exa
exa 是ls命令的替代品，可以彩色输出目录内容，更容易辨识。

$ exa --long --git




上面命令中，参数--git表示输出文件的 Git 状态。
N：新文件
M：文件有变动
I：该文件被忽略
除了平铺显示，exa还支持目录的树状显示。

$ exa --tree --level=2




exa本身是一个二进制文件，不需要安装，下载后直接使用，速度也相当快。
同类软件还有 lsd，这里就不详细介绍了。
二、broot
broot 可以看作增强版的ls替代品，实际是一个终端里面的文件管理器。
使用时，可以先列出当前目录的文件信息。

$ br -sdph



上面命令中，参数含义如下。
-s：显示文件体积
-d：显示文件时间
-p：显示文件权限
-h：显示隐藏文件。

可以看到，它默认以树状结构，展开子目录。
然后，在这个界面中，可以完成各种文件操作。
搜索：输入搜索词
复制：输入:cp <复制后的文件名>
删除：输入:rm
改名：输入:mv <新文件名>
退出：输入:q
甚至还可以预览文件：通过上下箭头选中文件，然后按下右箭头→，就会打开外部关联程序；按下ctrl + →，则在当前窗口预览文件。

三、zoxide
zoxide 是 cd 命令的替代品，用来切换目录。
它的用法与cd完全一样，进入目录/tmp就是下面的命令。

$ z /tmp



它的特色是部分匹配，可以只写路径的一部分，它自动找到最经常…]]></summary>

This effect has been the darling of journalists who want to explain why dumb people don’t know they’re dumb.
It's where 'dumb' people don't know that they are 'dumb' and think they are better than more skilled people. 
So maybe it's false?
mcgill.ca/oss/article/cr…
    
But I've found it helpful as a model of learning. Learning where you are ignorant is an essential step in understanding.
When you don't know anything about software development, and you want to learn, it seems like it will either be easy or impossibly hard. It's just a giant skill to acquire. 
But as you learn, you start to recognize all the different gradations of learning. So this one big thing is actually a bunch of skills, and there are levels of each of them.
And the more you learn about, say, backend development, the more you realize there are other areas you don't understand, like not just frontend, but networking programming, phone development, OS development, and writing firmware. Every little area is fractal with so much knowledge in it.
Part of learning is just learning how much you don't know, so it makes sense that "dumb people don't know how dumb they are" because knowing how dumb you are is something you have to learn. 
What do you think?]]></summary>

Bu bağlamda,  backend API gibi çeşitli kaynaklardan veri nesnelerine (data objects) erişmek ve bunları uygulamanın domain katmanına (iş mantığımızın yaşadığı yer olan) type-safe (tür güvenli) varlıklar olarak kullanılabilir hale getirmek için repository pattern'ı kullanabiliriz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I could share my current Indie Hacking toolkit. Hopefully, you'll find something interesting in here! A large portion of those tools can be used for free.
Note that only a tiny fraction of those tools are necessary, depending on the business you create/run. Keep in mind that a toolbox is just something that contains a set of tools that you might need. You don't have to pick them all at once. They're in your toolbox, and you can pick them up when you need to use them. Moreover, you don't need to get all of those at once. You can get new tools when you actually need those 🔧.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BotenaGo botnet source code has been leaked to GitHub, putting millions of routers and internet-of-things (IoT) devices at risk, researchers said.
In a Wednesday report, AT&T Alien Labs – which first discovered the difficult-to-detect malware in November – said it expects that the ready availability of the source code to malware authors will widen the number of attacks.
Uploading of the source code to GitHub “can potentially lead to a significant rise of new malware variants as malware authors will be able to use the source code and adapt it to their objectives,” Alien Labs security researcher Ofer Caspi wrote. “Alien Labs expects to see new campaigns based on BotenaGo variants targeting routers and IoT devices globally.”
Caspi said that as of yesterday, antivirus (AV) vendor detection for BotenaGo and its variants was still bumping along near the bottom when it comes to detecting the malware, with the BotenaGo samples discovered back in November still slipping past most AV software to infect systems with one of the most popular botnets: Mirai.
Alien Labs researchers recommend three steps to keep this malware off devices:
Maintain minimal exposure to the Internet on Linux servers and IoT devices and use a properly configured firewall.
Install security and firmware upgrades from vendors, as soon as possible;And check your system for unnecessary open ports and suspicious processes.

Occasionally, when something went wrong, we would do a stability release and spend a month only fixing bugs.  Testing was not a part of our build process but a part of our team: every feature team had quality assurance people who tested each feature before it was released.

启动性能是 APP 使用体验的门面，启动过程耗时较长很可能导致用户使用 APP 的兴趣骤减，抖音通过对启动性能做劣化的 AB 实验也验证了其对于业务指标有影响显著。抖音拥有数亿的用户，启动耗时几百毫秒的增长就可能带来成千上万用户的留存缩减，因此，启动性能的优化成为了抖音 Android 基础技术团队在体验优化方向上的重中之重。

本文基于过往对抖音 Android 客户端做启动性能优化的实战经验总结提炼出普适性的方法论，并将该过程中沉淀的工具加以分享，希望能给大家带来一些新的思考。

抖音 Android 性能优化系列往期文章回顾：新一代全能型性能分析工具 Rhea
带着问题出发

假如你要负责优化抖音的启动性能，你会怎样去规划整体的优化方案？你可能会一下子想到很多方面的细节点，比如：要优化主线程耗时、要减少布局层级、要对某些启动任务做按需加载或预加载、要避免主线程 IO、要对线程使用进行优化、还要有分析工具帮助定位性能问题等……
然而，该如何系统性地把这些细碎点组织起来并按照一定的章法来落地启动优化呢？此时，需要我们在具体细节点之上有进一步的问题分解与深入思考，最终形成一套完整的方法论，不仅能覆盖所有细节点，还能切实指导在实战中达成启动优化的效果。切实有效的方法论必然是从实战中经过千锤百炼才能形成的，而抖音庞大的用户基数又进一步保障了方法论的可行性与普适性。那么接下来让我们带着前述问题来看抖音的启动优化方法论是怎样的又是如何应用于实战之中的。
启动优化方法论
抖音的启动性能优化方法论分为五部分，分别是：理论分析、现状分析、启动性能优化、线上验证与防劣化。

这五部分间存在明显的先后顺序，又能闭环达成可持续的启动性能优化，下面将对这五部分做详细阐述：
理论分析
理论分析放在最先是为了从一开始就避免让视野受到限制，很多同学往往一开始接手启动优化就容…]]></summary>

鬼斧神工119：2022年1月最新耳机选购总结推荐指南2022 年真无线降噪蓝牙耳机推荐哪款？
2022年特别更新
我在留言中看到很多网友反映原文章内容太多过于复杂，看我的章只是想比较明确的获取目前适合选购耳机的信息。其实我的初衷是尽可能详细的展现测评过程，否则结论未免显得过于空洞。不过确实很多人只是想选购一款性价比高的耳机，对于那些基础的概念、复杂的原理不想也没必要花费太多的精力和时间成本去了解。所以在此更新总结今年也就是2022年最新值得考虑的高性价比头戴式耳机推荐。
有线头戴式耳机
森海塞尔HD560S。森海塞尔这款耳机大体表现或者说三频分布相对来说非常均衡。并不会有高频暗淡或者高频整体过亮。4kHz局部突出确实在一些音乐中会有所体现，但有些音乐并不明显。这段音染的范围并不大。并不会出现人声很尖锐的情况。整体人声高频的音染比AKG K701好不少。低频的量感和下潜表现也不错，低频的量感相对来说并不像一些开放式头戴式耳机偏少，下潜作为一款开放式耳机做到这样的程度也绝对是可圈可点的。总的来说我认为这款耳机的调音无愧于广告中的这句话。

虽然这款耳机作为一款开放式耳机。低频下潜和量感表现都不错，但是低频音质比较一般。并且低频的清晰度表现也有些问题，低频稍微有点糊。也就是这一点有待商榷。

此外，超高频有些乐器存在音染和音质问题，或者说有些超高频会稍微给人一种“塑料感”。但超高频的量感和延展并没有明显不足。并且森海这款耳机相对来说没有拜亚动力一些头戴式耳机的齿音问题。瑕不掩瑜，总体而言这款耳机的音质表现优秀，没有严重的硬伤。
这款耳机除了音质以外，个人认为还有一大亮点就是佩戴。这款耳机官方数据下为240g，比HD650轻20g。并且个人佩戴这款耳机并没有明显夹头，不知道是不是因为是热心网友已经用过一段时间的缘故。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近年来，极简理念时不时会被人们提起，引发了不少讨论，围绕极简理念展开的实践也层出不穷。单纯从少数派站内搜索，每年均有极简主题的文章。这些文章或从数字生活的实践出发，分享自己的极简体系；或从反映极简文化的理论出发，分享改善自己生活的经验；或对「极简」展开追问，反思「极简」的极限和衍生问题。这些文章对我们个人极简体系的搭建提供了不少可资参考的材料，且在操作指导上也比较详实。
与极简相关的站内文章
在落笔前，我在思考是否有必要再分享自己的经验，因为，该说的大多数都说过了，而我自己的体系也许并没有其他人的更好。最终落笔，则是因为想通了以下几点：
第一，纸上得来终觉浅，从《断舍离》这些反映极简理念的书籍中得出的实践不能说不好，但是否适合自己还要另说，「极简」有共性，但实践只能是个人体验；
第二，多数文章都是「自上而下」的实践，先有理论，再有操作，但这篇文章的经验却是「自下而上」的总结，是我在没有读过任何一本极简理念书籍前提下的摸索；
第三，再不济，文章也是对自己这一年来的经验总结，侥幸上了首页还能赚些稿费补贴家用。
文章分三大部分：第一部分写我的极简理念，第二部分写我的实践，主要是数字生活上的一些小实践，最后介绍极简体系的维持。为了便于理解，把理念阐释得有趣一些，第一部分有些天马行空，把各种不同领域的东西「混杂」在了一起，还望大家见谅。
读完本文，如果能对你有所帮助自然是好，如若觉得文章观点偏颇，还望朋友们在评论区不吝赐教。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's sketch the use case. We have some roles that can access a particular page.
These valid roles are defined in an array.
const roles = ['moderator', 'administrator', 'superman'];

How can we check to see if a user's role is part of this list?
For the sake of this article, we'll assume the user's role is a simple string like so:
cost role = 'user';

There are a couple of options for us here. Let's take a look at each of them.
This might be my personal most used option. It's quick and straightforward and has no weird overhead.
This includes method will return true or false if it can find the string you are looking for.
roles.includes('user');
// false

roles.includes('moderator');
// true

We can also use indexOf, which will return -1 if it can't find the item or the actual index if it does.
roles.indexOf('user');
// -1

roles.indexOf('superman');
// 2

This could be super helpful if you need the item's index anyway, but I think includes should work better for you if you don't.
Another way of doing this is using the some method, this will return a boolean like the includes method.
It will return if some of the items in the array match the search query.
roles.some((role) => role === 'user');
// false

roles.some((role) => role === 'moderator');
// true

Again, depending on the use-case, this could be the better solution, mainly good if you would have to check for multiple things to match.
The find method is a new way of searching an array, and it will return undefined or the item.
roles.find((role) => role === 'user');
// undefined

roles.find((role) => role === 'moderator');
// 'moderator'

This method is perfect if you need the entire object to do something with.
And there you go, multiple ways of checking if an array contains a value.
You can try all of these out in the following CodePen (Note: Open your terminal)

  2. [pushed mouse wheel + go down|up].


It will create some multi-cursors too, it's a bit faster than the one above.
 


  
  
  3. [ctrl + d].


[ctrl + d] will help you find some occurrences. For example, if you want to change several divs into paragraphs, pressing [ctrl + d] after highliting one will allow you to do that faster!
 


  
  
  4. [ctrl + shift + l].


You can also find all occurrences at once after highliting something with [ctrl + shift + l]. For example, this will select all the divs!
 


  
  
  5. [alt + click].


Finally, you can use [alt + click] to place a new cursor wherever you want.

毕业论文的意外收获
我作为一个食品安全专业的大学生，在学校时接受了完整的食品安全教育，对于食品添加剂、农药残留等当时社会热点问题理解深刻。比如那时的我认为，农药残留只要符合国家根据人体的毒理学特点制定的安全标准，并且经过科学、合理的检测过程，得出的农药残留数值达标就意味着农产品是安全的。
所以，那时的我深信，我们的农产品和食品的生产，对人体健康不会造成不良影响。社会公众需要的是更好的科普，以便更多的人理解在农残、食品添加剂这些热点问题中，「不谈剂量就是耍流氓」。国家需要做的是更严格地执法，避免不法分子，尤其是那些缺少知识、没有文化的小商小贩们为了一己私利而坑害公众健康。至于大企业、大农场、大工厂生产的农产品和食品，在正规的商超进行销售，那就安全无虞，放心吃就是了。
然而，深信了接近 4 年之后，快要毕业的时候我发现，我还是太年轻了。这种感觉，来自我毕业论文的一个意外收获。
青稞面条的研制
我的毕业设计是研发一种青稞面条的配方，其目的是利用青稞中的 beta-葡聚糖含量较高的特点，增加面条中 beta-葡聚糖的含量，从而降低糖尿病人吃完面条后血糖升高的速度和血糖峰值，起到减缓糖尿病症状的作用。
这里我们先进行一点点科普。糖尿病分为 1 型糖尿病和 2 型糖尿病。1 型糖尿病是先天性的，可以理解为一种基因缺陷，患者的胰岛素绝对缺乏，相对很少见。绝大多数糖尿病患者罹患的是 2 型糖尿病，它是后天产生的，患者的胰岛素只是相对缺乏，多与肥胖、高血压等并发。其产生的机理可以大致的理解为，由于饮食过量过甜、缺乏锻炼等原因，进食后血糖快速升高。此…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2020，罗技的 MX Master 3 鼠标发布了，我抱着试一试的心态，买了一只。之后越用越发现自己离不开这款鼠标了，不光是因为罗技的驱动和软件，还有鼠标手势和优联。当然也有很多痛点，
下面我就来聊聊我使用这款鼠标一年之后的体验和感受。
外观
MX 系列的外观一向都不是最好看的，但办公的实用性和比较出色的人体工学都让这款鼠标有了独一无二的特点。
Logitech MX Master 3
MX Master 3 使用了大面积的橡胶覆盖在鼠标表面，好处是防滑，但坏处也不是没有。
在经历了我这一年的高强度使用后，左侧拇指的地方出现的明显的磨损，右侧也出现了但不是非常明显，导致手如果有点出汗的情况下会黏手，和新鼠标的差距还是不小的。当然这也是无法避免的，例如当年的微软“大馒头”鼠标在长时间使用后也会磨损的特别厉害。

 
鼠标的其余大部分地方都使用了塑料，手感不错，也没有廉价感，磨损的相对也不算严重。
按键方面MX Master 3分别有常规的左右键，前进/后退键以外，还有一个电磁滚轮、切换键和一个罗技独有的手势按钮。
MagSpeed 主滚轮
比较有特点的是罗技在纵向和横向滚轮上都使用了金属材质，其中纵向滚轮还使用了罗技的“MagSpeed”技术的电磁滚轮，手感体验不错。但是横向滚轮就没有这么幸运了，只是一个普通的无极滚轮，也没有段落感可以调节。
侧向滚轮
鼠标的底部有一个电源开关和连接设备的切换按键，按下可以顺序切换连接设备。并且内置了重力感应，让鼠标底面朝上的时候指示灯才亮起，并且当鼠标朝下的时候会禁用切换按钮，在省电的同时还降低了误触按钮的尴尬。
鼠标底面
体验/软件
其实软件这部分可能没什么好说的，无非就是那些传统的按键自定义功能。比较独特的是罗技可以根据你正在使用的 APP 来设定相应的快捷键。例如我在使用 Chrome 的时候可以把侧键设置成前进和后退，在使用 PS…]]></summary>

心智模型的简短入门
从80年代开始，“心智模型”在学术文献中出现的频率迅速上升。但为什么它被频繁提起？因为它是人类行为的主要驱动力之一。
心智模型是是我们预测我们与周围世界互动结果的一种心智表征*。它是对某人关于某事在现实世界中如何运作的思考过程的解释。它是周围世界、其各个部分之间的关系以及一个人对自己的行为及其后果的直觉感知的表示。Kenneth Craik被认为是第一个提出这个观点的人（1943）。1983年，Don Norman 写了一篇文章，引发了这个词在学术界之外的广泛使用。而在此5年之后，Norman在他的著作《The Design of Everyday Things》中再次提及这个词。此后心智模型开始在设计等应用领域发挥作用。

心智表征*
指的是一种假设性的内在认知符号，能够表示外在现实；或是指一种利用某种符号的心理过程。心智表征可以指实际上并不存在于感官中的事物之心理意象，比如记忆中烧烤的味道；也能够表现那些个体没有经验过或不存在的事物：想像你自己在一个你没有去过的地方旅程，或是有第三只手臂。（来源：维基百科）

操控党之所以留恋汽油味，因为汽油味某种程度上是一道门槛。


「汽油味儿」所指为何？
到2020年，汽车行业发展已经超过130年，而在前120年里，地球上的汽车品牌一直在减少，没有增加。
主要原因是汽车行业是一个高壁垒的行业，内燃机、变速箱将大多数实力薄弱的新兴企业隔绝在外，并逐渐演变成大国国力角逐的主要领域---汽车行业直接决定了一个国家的工业地位。小国即便以举国之力也无法建立一家成熟的汽车企业，为此全球主要汽车品牌都集中在美、日、德、法、中等几大经济体。
虽然内燃机和变速箱构建了汽车行业的门槛，但并不作为汽车企业的核心竞争力。汽车品牌之所以得以传承，在于打造始终如一的驾控风格，这一点在汽车品牌的宣传中显而易见。

宝马在上个世纪30年代首次提出了「乐趣」的概念，并逐渐演变成「纯粹驾驶乐趣」（Sheer Driving Pleasure）。为此，所有的发动机、变速箱都围绕这个概念展开，即便经过了直列发动机到涡轮增压发动机的转变，这个品牌精神一直都在。

福特也在上个世纪中叶提出了「Drive a Ford and FEEL the difference」的品牌概念。这个概念在2000年前后被福特重新重视，并发展为福特的品牌理念。海外为「Drive Difference」，中文为「Feel The Difference」，翻译为「感受非凡」，接着为中国消费者提供了一连串驾控优秀的福克斯、蒙迪欧等车型。
这也就是为什么操控党钟情「汽油味儿」。
电气化之后，新势力涌入，性能虽然非常夸张，通过堆砌电池、电机做出远超内燃机的数据，但操控始终无法令人满意，甚至有些糟糕，只能通过智能体验吸引用户。驾驶风格作为汽车企业的核心…]]></summary>

So...
Basically, what this platform does is applies three security layers your URL to make in safe, secure and fast. These layers makes your website worthy and removes the sources info of social medias, which makes it super secure.

Go to Xoomato URL Guard

Copy your article URL and paste it in Original Url

Choose security mode as Normal Security

Today, I worked on a lot of different things. I made some progress with learning SQL and Next.js as well as coding the Terms of Use page for my business site. Not too bad I'd say.
Note: The character in the thumbnail is Lena from 86.
Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!
I set my goals for this week, which are:
finish the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages, and then deploy them.
learning more SQL, Next.js, and Scrum.
learned how to render markdown as JSX.
continued going through Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
practice doing nested SELECTs.
learn more about how correlated subqueries work.
learned how to use aggregate functions, SUM and COUNT.
continued to go through SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial.
read this article, titled Myth 3: In Scrum, releases are done only at the end of the Sprint by Barry Overeem.
it is okay to release updates to production even before the Sprint Review.
it is recommended to keep expanding the Definition of Done (DoD).

In this article, we're going to see how to choose the right Headless CMS.
If you're new to the Headless CMS industry, I wrote an article on the subject, you can get it here. 
What you're about to read comes from my personal real-world Experiences, it's based on clarity on the issue of the article.
That being said, Let's discover together.

Working with different clients on different projects, and each project has its own requirements, it becomes harder to pick and choose the best Headless CMS for your Project. 
Sometimes, it's because of the complexity of the features a Headless CMS can provide, or the number of Headless CMS available on the market.
Sometimes you have to ask yourself some of these types of questions:

如果我告诉你，构建元宇宙所需要的所有内容和软件都已经有了，而且完全免费，你会去构建吗？

先别急，让我们退一步来解释一下元宇宙。

什么是元宇宙？

20 世纪的赛博朋克作家，如 Gibson 和 Stephenson，都曾想象过由虚拟现实支持的互联网，在 Stephenson 的小说《雪崩Snow Crash》中，他将其称之为元宇宙Metaverse。随着虚拟现实virtual reality（VR）设备和应用程序的日益普及，尤其是在马克•扎克伯格宣布将雇佣 1 万人来打造它，并将 Facebook 的公司名称改为 Meta 之后，元宇宙正在成为一个热门词汇。Matthew Ball 对该话题进行了 认真分析，并以“共同构建”作为结论：“事实上，最有可能的是，元宇宙是来自不同的平台、机构和技术的网络中，它们协同配合（无论多么不情愿），并拥抱互操作性。”

互操作性，这个词本身含蓄而清楚地指出了开源和开放标准在其中的作用。

因此，简而言之，它就是支持 VR 的互联网。

如何建立一个开源的元宇宙？

就像互联网上的网络服务器一样，你需要 VR 服务器。不过不用担心，我写了一个，而且 介绍它的文章 大约一年前就发表在这里了。当然，你需要支持 VR 的网络浏览器，但网络浏览器已经支持视频/音频流（WebRTC）以及 VR 和 AR（WebXR）。此外，你还需要大量 3D 内容，最好是开源标准的 glTF 格式。幸运的是，Sketchfab 拥有 50 万个以上的免费 3D 模型，由大量的作者在知识共享许可Creative Commons licenses下发布。Sketchfab 并不是唯一一家这样做的公司，但他们提供了 REST API 来搜索和下载这些模型。

别忘了键盘

在 VR 中已经待了一段时间了，…]]></summary>

0 写在最前面
2021 年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔 1-2 年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在 …]]></summary>

我是一个不会文笔的糟年轻人，或许和屏幕前的你一样，间歇性灵感爆发，持续性颓废丧志，很多时候看着很多自律的文章，想着自己也可以与他们一样：高效、自律，像一个齿轮一般啮合在自己想要的位置。
但，现实是残酷的，一个紧急的项目，你会失去原本计划的出行；一顿宵夜，让你的每日运动计划直接奔溃；说好的周末充电，结果半夜躺在床上刷着短视频，最终一觉不醒……
这是一篇不是种草，不是测评，也不是鸡汤的文章，不敢说指点到你，或许，可以引起你的共鸣。
谈谈内卷严重的机械圈
我自身读的就是文科，但是大学选专业却是执意选择了机械专业，原因是我的生物实在太差，逼上梁山只能选文科，选机械有自己的爱好，也是固执认为找工作简单（事实确实如此），毕业后很多人选择别的行业，或者在机械圈内做业务等的顶流工作。而我因为在大学已经厌倦了销售类工作，最终还是转向了技术流。
你的第一份工作究竟如何选择
即使我还年轻，但是机械圈真的，太小了，小到你换几次工作之后，你的几家公司的同事会在你的朋友圈互相打招呼，圈小可想而知。很多人对机械圈有着根深蒂固的抗拒，“电子厂”、“拧螺丝”、“找不到对象”，这些固化的印象导致大家对这个圈子越来越抗拒。

如果你决定进入机械圈，我的建议是，毕业之后先进入大厂，有人（某些年长者）会告诉你，进大厂是没有前途的，最后只能靠加班费过活，没有感情的电子厂，完全没有前途。但，我要告诉你的是——
我的第一份工作就是校企联合的招聘，一家港企，做出的设备是国内厂商一辈子的梦想，其在CPU领域与inter的合作基本上就是垄断。到这里估计有人会说，外资完全不当大陆人当人看，晋升渠道基本为0，其实我并不觉得这是对的，外国工程师一样是打心底看不起我们，但是，试问香港几家大学，每年培养多少机械人？如果开发给大陆员工晋升，那估计一年半，整个企业都是讲普通话的大陆人了，所以，很多外企掐住的只是高管等关键…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这实际上是一个“功能安全”问题 —— 由于电子电气功能不正常工作而导致人身安全风险的问题。
啥叫电子电气功能不工作呢？ 
比如说，不踩油门它自己加速、挂了前进档车却往后移动…… 这是比较严重的，很可能会出或大或小的事故。
也有一些“看起来不太严重”的，比如仪表黑屏、中控黑屏。 当我还是一名功能安全工程时的时候，我一开始想：黑就黑了呗，车照样可以开，有什么大不了的呢？当年Benz发明汽车时，没有仪表不照样开吗？
我的领导不这么想，在他的引导下，我们使用HAZOP、HARA等方法，分析了“黑屏”的各种可能性：

高速上突然黑屏 → 引起驾驶员惊慌分神 → 部分水平较差的驾驶员，慌乱中误以为动力系统也失效了 → 紧急靠边停车的过程中发生碰撞 → 人身伤亡
高速上突然黑屏 → 驾驶员忘了仪表上还有车速 → 驾驶员在长时间不知道确切车速的情况下继续驾驶 → 对车速判断失误造成追尾或其它碰撞 → 人身伤亡
停车场突然黑屏 → 驾驶员立刻刹停观察现象 → 安全
停车场未黑屏，但屏幕死机了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡
停车场未黑屏，但屏幕卡顿了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡

第五种情况实际上发生过：
车主曝特斯拉“挂D挡往后走”！后台数据公布：前后换挡多达14次
总体来说，传统车企的功能安全工程师认为：仪表与中控都是安全相关的，(至少仪表)功能不能出错：无论任何情况下，既不能黑屏，也不能死机、卡住。
但我想，这要求未免有点太高了。因为过高的可靠性，意味着成本…… 成本最终还是给消费者的。
为此，我曾向多位传统车企的功能安全工程师提出一种不成熟的想法：

 在卖车的时候，提醒消费者“咱们这车啊，在高速上是有可能黑屏死机的；莫慌，继续开即可”。当驾驶员有黑屏的心理预期之后，第一次遇到黑屏也不会慌，从而避免了事故。

关于这一点，我有实际体验：
第一次遇到黑屏时，好慌，大概花了5秒钟我才确认“车子还可以开”、“只是个小事情，镇定”、“导航信息没了，还是赶紧找机会停车重启吧“！
第二次遇到黑屏时，一点也不慌了 —— 因为心里有预期它会黑屏，所以造边停车重启，常规操作了。

 仪表与中控可以失效，但是要求：一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。如此一来，就避免了仪表与中控显示错误的误导而造成的事故。

不出意料，传统车企听了我的想法后都直摇头：你这么做，与特斯拉有什么区别？ 出了事故，特斯拉扛得住舆论，咱们可扛不住啊！
想想也对，这不单单的工程技术的事情，也要考虑车企的公关思路不同。综合考虑后，每个车企只能选择最适合自己的技术方案。
尽管如此，我还是向特斯拉提一个建议，可以让车主更安全： 仪表与中控可以失效，但是一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。

Processing text is one of the most common tasks in programming, so most languages since Perl come with some kind of regular expression system. Generally the basic regexps are the same, but each language comes with some unique extensions. Raku notably does not keep the traditional regexp syntax even for the common things, but conceptually they're mostly the same.
A regular expression can extract information from a string based on some pattern, but often we need something more advanced. So a lot of languages also have some way to define tokenizers, which chop the string into pieces based on multiple regular expressions. Notably Perl's /gc flag, and Ruby StringScanner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We will go over data repersentation of computer systems this chapter. That is, when we need to think in a computer way, you should know how computer think at first (in binary).
What is the base of a number?
And usually, there are different bases we use in studying system, like binary number (base 2), octal number (base 8), and hexadecimal number (base 16). 
We can see them being used in computer world:
Number like '0X1E', is HEX number:
1 Byte = 8 Bits

Specially, one another data type in C is called POINTER, which is also significant:
Pointer:
4 bytes in 32-bit-system
8 bytes in 64-bit-system




  
  
  The knowledge that we are reviewing, is usually based on 32-bit systems



  
  
  3. Conversion between different bases



- DEC to BIN:


BIN to DEC: mentioned above
X base number to Y base number: 


X base to DEC
And then DEC to Y base
When comes to 1100 1001 (which is equal to 201 in decimal):
Two's complement is used to do the substraction or repersenting negative number in binary (Of course, adding a negative is substracting a positive number).
Get the 0101's 1's complement in 8-bit machine, having 1111 1010.
Add one, having 1111 1011. Then, 1111 1011 is the number repersenting -5 in 8-bit machine.
They happen when sum of 2 positive (or negative) number but get the negative (positive) number in machine, due to the fact that when machine has no more bit to extend to repersent this number.
Overflow: Sum of 2 positive but get the negative
Underflow: Sum of 2 negative but get the positive

今天 A 少 问了个有趣的问题：

如果可以模拟 PointerEvent 进行分发，那么在应用中就可以通过 代码 来触发手势事件，这样就能解放双手。如果结合语音监听，通过代码处理，说话也能触发手势操作，岂不美哉。
手势机制 和 滑动机制 ，又有完成这两本小册的我，感觉这个问题应该可解。下面就将整个问题的解决过程进行梳理，带大家再认识一下手势底层的相关实现。
一、模拟按下事件
1. 思路分析1
PointerEvent 作为手势机制中被传递的数据，它记录着触点的 id ，坐标 、触点类型  等信息。所以如果有办法发送一个 PointerDownEvent 的消息，不就表示按下了吗？

2. 自己分发事件
然后想到手势事件分发是由 GestureBinding 处理的，而我们可以通过 GestureBinding.instance 获取 GestureBinding 对象。那是不是意味着，可以自己来分发一个  PointerDownEvent 的消息。于是创建如下示例界面：上部有两个按钮分别用于 模拟滑动 和 模拟点击。

我们现在的目标是通过 模拟点击 可以点击右下角的加号按钮，从而让上面黄色区域内的数字自加；通过 模拟滑动 让列表滑动。
于是写了如下 48 行的代码通过 GestureBinding 对象的 dispatchEvent 来分发事件：

现在问题来了，第二入参需要传入 HitTestResult 对象。

但它是一个可空的入参，所以传个 null 试试：
GestureBinding.instance!.dispatchEvent(p0, null);

很不出所料地，抛了异常，看来这样直接发送消息似乎并不是正解。那么来分析一下这样为何不可。

3. GestureBinding#dispatchEvent 的逻辑处理
下面通过调试来看一下 Gestu…]]></summary>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第10天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
前言
在使用Kotlin语言进行开发时，我相信很多开发者都信手拈来地使用by或者by lazy来简化你的属性初始化，但是by lazy涉及的知识点真的了解吗  假如让你实现这个功能，你会如何设计。
正文
话不多说，我们从简单的属性委托by来说起。
委托属性
什么是委托属性呢，比较官方的说法就是假如你想实现一个比较复杂的属性，它们处理起来比把值保存在支持字段中更复杂，但是却不想在每个访问器都重复这样的逻辑，于是把获取这个属性实例的工作交给了一个辅助对象，这个辅助对象就是委托。
比如可以把这个属性的值保存在数据库中，一个Map中等，而不是直接调用其访问器。
看完这个委托属性的定义，假如你不熟悉Kotlin也可以理解，就是我这个类的实例由另一个辅助类对象来提供，但是这时你可能会疑惑，上面定义中说的支持字段和访问器是什么呢，这里顺便给不熟悉Kotlin的同学普及一波。
Java的属性
当你定义一个Java类时，在定义字段时并不是所有字段都是属性，比如下面代码：
//Java类
public class Phone {
    
    //3个字段
    private String name;
    private int price;
    private int color;

    //name字段访问器
    private String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    private void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    //price字段访问器
    private int getPrice…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
哈喽，又是我，欢迎回来「Geek7even《极物研习社》」
2个月前，笔者所在单位进行了办公室搬迁，顺便给所有人升级了一波办公环境▽▼

▲△笔者是个桌搭爱好者，家里两套桌面都走的深色系风格。而在办公室这种明亮的空间，配上浅色的桌椅，便心痒痒想要搭一套简单干净的浅色系办公桌面。想着“给自己一个舒服的工作环境，毕竟一天有1/4都在这里度过“这一借口，剁手起来也没有那么心疼了
桌椅基建
笔者家里卧室是用的西昊M57B，一年多使用下来，坐感舒适，前段时间问了屁股君，它也表示肯定，便随手推荐给了行政。没想到公司一下采购了20来张，用于新办公室的设备升级▽▼

▲△几个大男孩光是安装椅子都弄到腰疼，早知道推不需要用户自行安装的Herman Miller算了（狗头）
西昊M57售价不到千元，这是市场竞争最激烈的细分价格档之一。各大主流品牌都在这一细分价格档推出了不少具有竞争力的产品。甚至光看外表，长得跟几千元的高端款椅子区别也不大（虚荣心作祟）▽▼

▲△金属五爪、透气网面、可调节扶手、腰靠、颈靠，该有的一个不少，性价比非常高。笔者觉得预算不多，但又想体验比较好的人体座椅的时候，瞄准千元这个价位去选择，遇到的坑和雷会少很多
而桌子则统一采购的电动升降桌，原本在用的两张网易严选被我们拉进了黑名单，电机启动时（下降）总有一下顿挫感，桌子用得越久震感越强，实在难受。在线下的办公座椅店逛了一天后，敲定了来自9am的这款企业级电动升降桌产品▽▼

▲△不要被定价吓到，因为走得大宗订单，下单了18件，定制选配1.4米桌板后价格还是比较划算的
9am的pesk系列电动升降桌，是目前笔者摸过用过的电动升降桌中，电机运行最稳定，工作噪音最低的产品了。而且是三段式桌腿，最低高度能到60cm，个子小点的伙伴也不需要被86cm高的桌子折磨

2个月的体验下来，pesk确实贵有贵的道理。电机稳定性无与伦比…]]></summary>

最近用 Adobe Illustrator 绘制了一大堆图标，操作基本都保持右手握鼠标、左手小拇指以 Ctrl 为圆心在键盘上活动的状态。在绘制过程中左手常常需要按下大量的快捷键，为了提高效率，我把快捷键设定在了键盘最上面一排的功能键上。而实际用起来，从 F5 键向右，操作逐渐又不方便起来了。
我开始想象：如果有一个小的键盘可以放在左手旁边、每个按键都能映射为不同的快捷键就好了。这个理想中的键盘需要满足这几点：

可自定义按键功能，实现快捷操作；
体积小，按键尽可能多；
造型简洁，最好是无线；
可以根据当前软件自动切换按键功能（加分项）

根据以上要求，很快我就搜到了这次的主角：微软蓝牙数字键盘。

微软蓝牙数字键盘的键位与普通键盘的数字区基本一致。通过蓝牙与电脑配对成功后，左上角的按键可以快速打开计算器进行计算。另外，它可以同时与3台设备配对，通过背面的按钮进行切换。
安装键盘配套应用的「微软鼠标和键盘中心」后，18个按键中，有17个都可以自行设置功能（计算器键只能打开计算器或充当 NumLock 键）。通过 basic settings 可以设置全局按键功能，在 app-specific settings 中可以为不同应用单独设置按键功能，从而实现切换应用时自动切换案件配置方案。
应用中可选择的众多预设功能列表
在「微软鼠标和键盘中心」中提供了众多预设功能，利用列表的最后隐蔽着的 Key Combination 和 Macro 设置自定义快捷键、录制宏，则是让这个键盘成为真正的效率神器的关键。
使用体验
以 Adobe Illustrator 为例，它的快捷键组合非常多，其中不乏要按下 Alt Shift Ctrl 的同时按下一个字母键的，难以单手操作；想要为常用的一些操作设置快捷键时，不仅要考虑能否轻松地单手按下，又要避免与现有的快捷键重复。使用微软蓝牙数字键盘设置快捷键可以不用考虑能否单手操作的问题，即便远在键盘两端的 Shift + Ctrl + 9 也可以通过指定的一个按键完成操作。
我将使用频率较高的快捷键映射到这个键盘，又为一些原本没有快捷键的高频操作设置了新的快捷键。如下图将快捷键设置好之后，绘制图形的效率显著提高。例如原本需要 Ctrl + C、Shift + Ctrl + V 两步操作的「就地粘贴」操作，现在只需要按下「.」键即可完成。
我设置的按键功能与对应快捷键
上图中大部分是通过 Key Combination 设置直接输入对应快捷键，「就地复制」的功能是通过 Macro 设置实现。值得一提的是，你还可以在 Macro 设置中输入鼠标按键和鼠标位移。

总结
微软蓝牙数字键盘外观小巧简洁；功能上不仅能满足日常办公、媒体控制这些基本操作，也可以在图片处理、视频剪辑等场景下提高效率，甚至用来玩游戏、演示幻灯片……只要根据你的使用场景进行设置，这样一个特别的小键盘也一定可以成为你的效率神器。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国部分企业关键芯片的库存只能支持数天

美国商务部称，芯片短缺的情况将会持续，企业部分关键零部件的库存只能支撑不到五天。调查显示，关键芯片库存中值已从 2019 年的能够支撑 40 天下降到 2021 年的不到五天。与此同时，对芯片的需求也比 2019 年高出约 20%。调查显示，芯片供需存在严重、持续的错配，受访者认为这个问题在未来六个月内不会消失。


老王点评：看来未来的日子还将继续艰难。




谷歌宣告放弃 FLoC

谷歌两年来一直计划用其他技术来取代 Cookie，以向用户提供有针对性的广告，其使用的是一个名为 FLoC 的系统。FLoC，即“群组联合学习”，将通过使用一个浏览器内的算法来取代 Cookie。该算法将分析用户的浏览历史以确定用户的“兴趣群组”，而广告商根据群组精准投放。其设计初衷是为用户提供一定程度的隐私，但谷歌表示 FLoC 可能不足以保护用户的身份。此外，该系统也遭受到广告商的强烈反对，并在欧盟受到投诉。多家基于 Chromium 的浏览器开发商也都决定禁用 FLoC。周二，谷歌表示向有关拟议的投诉让步，转而计划采取 不同的方法。


老王点评：本质上，谷歌就是一家广告公司，所以它设计的方案自然得不到信任。




由于积极行动，大规模的 Log4j 攻击没有到来

Sophos 认为，因为该漏洞的严重性使数字和安全社区团结起来，激励人们采取行动，攻击者大规模利用 Log4j 漏洞的直接威胁 被避免了。该公司指出，在 12 月 20 日至 23 日期间，被其防火墙阻止的 Log4j 攻击达到顶峰，然后在 1 月期间逐渐减少。


老王点评：但这并不意味着我们已经摆脱了风险，在未来几年会持续有黑客利用这些漏洞发起攻击。]]></summary>

支持电话是很重要的，而且最后往往是令人满意的，但明确的沟通行为对每个参与的人来说都是艰巨的。如果你曾经参加过支持电话，你可能会花好几分钟拼出了最短的命令，并详细解释了空格和回车的位置。虽然直接拿过来用户电脑的控制权往往更容易，但这并不是真正的教育的最佳方式。你可以尝试向用户发送一个屏幕记录，而他们可以复制命令并粘贴到自己的终端。

Asciinema 是一个开源的终端会话记录器。与 script 和 scriptreplay 命令类似，Asciinema 准确记录了你的终端显示。它将你的“电影”记录保存到一个文本文件中，然后根据需要进行回放。你可以把你的电影上传到 Asciinema.org，就像你在互联网上分享任何其他视频一样，你甚至可以把你的电影嵌入到网页中。

安装 Asciinema

在 Linux 上，你可以使用你的包管理器安装 Asciinema。

在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia 或类似系统上：

$ sudo dnf install asciinema


在 Debian、Linux Mint 或类似系统上：

$ sudo apt install asciinema


在 macOS 上，你可以用 Homebrew 安装：

$ sudo brew install asciinema


在 BSD 和任何其它平台上使用 Pkgsrc：

$ cd /usr/pkgsrc/misc/py-asciinema
$ sudo bmake install clean


从文本中制作电影

要用 Asciinema 开始录制，你可以使用 rec 子命令：

$ asciinema rec mymovie.cast

@Voyager_1：《写出我心》
如果希望从这本书中获得什么写作的技巧和手法之类，大概会失望而归，因为这本书几乎没有写到任何写作的方法论。但如果你正处在想写未写、能写却觉得写不好、写过一些却因为拖延没能继续写的状态，那么你一定要读一读这本书。

作者娜塔莉·戈德堡（Natalie Goldberg）是一名诗人、画家、作家和书写教练，1986 年出版的这本《写出我心》中倡导的「用写作来修行」，是她禅修多年的核心体悟，也是她往后多年开办「真正的秘密」写作营的核心理念，这一切最终也让她成为了世界级的写作名师。
习得性的技能往往可以用「道、器、术」来做个贴切的比方，拿写作来说：让你知道写作是由心而发，在你心中的念头，无人能帮你写出一篇佳作，讲求的是「道」；教你运用纸笔、电脑甚至软件来更好地写诗、散文或小说则是在传授「器」的使用方法；最后才到我们熟悉的描述事件时尽量写清楚时间、地点、人物的小学作文技巧，这是市面上最常见的写作书题材，也是最泛泛而不可论的「术」。真正的大师不会教你「术」，而会将你指引到你的「道」上，娜塔莉就是这么做的。
事实上本书的结构非常松散，从「初写者的心、笔和纸」、「堆肥」、「别和苍蝇结婚」等章节标题中，你只能窥见一点不明所以的关键词。但娜塔莉设身处地给你讲述的各种经历、思考，穿插了她或其禅师的妙语和人生体悟，足以让你心中激荡起写作的激情，脑中迸发出对写作这份修行的思考，因为她本身就是一位循循善诱的写作老…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://sspai.com/post/71169"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这两年大概是我们这代人经历过的最特殊的一段时光了，突如其来的疫情让整个世界变了样，本以为会是短暂的噩梦，却没想会成为一场持久战，甚至持久到改变了我们的生活——比如被迫成为宅男宅女。
今年春节是第二次在外过年了，全区核酸检测也已经开始了，不知道有多少人不仅会被迫异地过年，甚至会禁足家中。作为一个不久前因为手术禁足家中三月的人倒是对此有很多心得。
 
生活总要继续，既然我们无法选择，那只能尽量让自己过的舒服一点，除了冰箱里塞的满满当当的牛排鸡翅车厘子可乐外，还有一些好玩的东西可以帮助你度过这段家里的日子，让2022的生活开始的不那么糟糕。
主子‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍
如果有的话。

家里有个会蹦会跳还不是熊孩子的活物当然是最好的，猫主子总能治愈一切，虽然有时候逼逼叨叨的也很烦，但rua几下肚子就能让对方放下身段发出满足的呼噜声，不仅主子不会再唠叨了，你也被解救了，被需要的感觉总是很好的。

而且，每天例行的逗猫、喂粮、换水、铲屎还能帮你在暗无天日的居家中养成规律的作息，每天早上叫醒你的不是上班闹铃，而是主子的呼唤，这样当结束这段日子之后，也能无缝转换回坚强的打工人。

一套好听的音响
宅家里最怕的是什么？寂寞。就连强大如汤姆汉克斯也需要和“星期五”逼逼叨叨才能熬过寂寞的日子，所以一个人宅在家中一定要让家里有些声响，毕竟在自己的BGM里没人能打败你。虽然可能是被迫宅家，但在家的一大好处就是可以用音响，相比耳机有更广的声场，更好的氛围，也不会因为长时间佩戴而不舒服。
比起传统的有线HiFi音响，我在家都是用的WiFi无线音响，一方面没有麻烦的布线，其次是用手机、iPad和Mac通过AirPlay播放音乐更方便，WiFi音响虽然音质不如有线HiFi，但也是远胜于蓝牙音响的，而又没有HiFi有线音响布线和音源功放的繁琐，是比较平衡的选择。

而且，WiFi音响在宅家时还有一个好处，在不同…]]></summary>

安全最重要：面对疫情，做好防护
如今的世界疫情横行，在许多人不得不「就地过年」的当下，如果你有幸能够在春运时节踏上返乡的旅途，做好安全防护无疑是重中之重。在此时的长途旅行之中，最重要的莫过于基础的防护措施 —— 口罩戴好（别忘了多备几个）、勤洗手消毒、非必要不交谈。
尽管消毒洗手液很可能无法带上火车或者飞机，公共场所通常都会配备消毒设备，可以利用；此外还可以携带消毒湿巾等以备急用。在人流量较大的场合，比如车站、机场，也务必注意戴好口罩并保持社交距离。在这里，我们就疫情可能对你的返乡旅途造成的影响，列出一些可能有用的工具，希望能够帮助你在疫情中保护好自己，顺利返乡。
各地防疫政策查询
由于疫情瞬息万变，各地的疫情防控政策也处于不断的变动当中。中国政府网（中华人民共和国中央人民政府官方网站）已上线疫情防控政策查询系统，我们只需选择出发地和目的地，就可以查看这两地城市的最新疫情防控政策，以及出发时和落地时可能需要准备的疫情防控相关的材料（比如健康码、核酸检测报告等） 。
通过对比两地政策，我们就可以知道目的地能不能去、出发地可不可离开、离开或者到达时需要准备什么等等。
 深圳」的查询结果">
此外，还可以通过官方「国务院客户端小程序」微信小程序、支付宝 小程序 等进行疫情防控政策的查询，查询结果与上文网页一致。可以用对应 app 扫描下方的小程序码，即可打开疫情防控政策的查询页面。

此外，如果对查询结果有疑问，还可以拨打查询结果页面上提供的电话进行咨询，获得政策发布方的一手政策解读。
疫情情况查询
每日疫情动态突发，大家的微信群、朋友圈和微博或许都能看到很多疫情消息。但是疫情情况还是应该以国务…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A no-code app builder is a great resource for creating your own application without programming skills or a huge budget. These platforms often have the pre-built templates, drag-and-drop functionality to design UI, and integrations with  databases, so they can ultimately be deployed as your own mobile or web app.
There are many no-code app builders on the market, and it can be hard to find the best option, especially because you can often only see a landing page, marketing information, and exciting slogans. 
Serhii Pospielov, AI Practice Head at Exadel, reviewed several no-code app builders from a developer's point of view. He tried to create MVPs on 13 different platforms, but only managed to achieve that on five (this doesn’t mean that the other eight aren’t good platforms – just that they didn’t meet his particular business need).  Serhii’s favorite no-code app builders were: 
Appery.io, 
AppGyver, 
Check out his Best No-Code App Builders (Part 1) on Medium and see the other top platforms in his list along with their screenshots of interfaces. 
You’ll also find concrete information about the difference between no-code and low-code mobile app builders, the role of back end on a mobile application, the key stages in developing a mobile app, and more things to consider when evaluating the costs of no-code app builders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript list of operators containing question marks might surprise new developers approaching the language for the first time. 
nullish coalescing operator (??) works. 
Following MDN definition, "The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy".
condition ? expression1 : expression2

You can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. 
This is not entirely accurate but before diving into truthy and falsy let's see an example with a condition that can only be true or false.
let condition = true;
console.log(condition ? 'exp 1' : 'exp 2'); // exp 1

Since we defined a variable called condition as true, the ternary operator executes the first expression which is a simple string "exp 1". 
The console.log() around the ternary operator logs the result of the ternary operator and it logs "exp 1".
As I said above, you can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. But this is not entirely accurate!
So, what is the problem?
When talking about Javascript Ternary Operator, MDN talks about truthy and falsy instead of true and false.
condition ? expression1 : expression2

IF the condition is truthy execute expression1 else (falsy) execute expression2.
In simple terms, 
Truthy values are equal or can be converted to true. Which values are truthy? All values unless they are defined as falsy. Thanks…
Falsy values are equal or can be converted to false. (i.e. false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, and NaN).

See some more examples using the ternary operator with strings and numbers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project: Codever - File:  user.router.js
The values are present in the request.body which contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body.
In our case we access the userDisplayName with the following expression request.body.userDisplayName as in the example below:
usersRouter.post('/:userId/bookmarks/upload', keycloak.protect(),
  uploadBookmarks.single("bookmarks" /* name attribute of <file> element in your form */),
  async (request, response) => {
    userIdTokenValidator.validateUserId(request);

    const userDisplayName = request.body.userDisplayName;
    const importResponse = await browserBookmarksImportService.imporBrowserBookmarks(request.params.userId, request.file.buffer, userDisplayName);

    const str = JSON.stringify(importResponse, null, 2); // spacing level = 2
    console.log(str);

    return response.status(HttpStatus.OK).send(importResponse);
  }
);

In angular the userDisplayName value has been appended to the FormData and submitted to a post request
  uploadBookmarks(userId: String, bookmarks: File, userDisplayName: string): Observable<any> {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('bookmarks', bookmarks);
    formData.append('userDisplayName', userDisplayName);

    return this.httpClient.post(`${this.usersApiBaseUrl}/${userId}/bookmarks/upload`, formData);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In software engineering, SOLID is an acronym for 5 design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, robust, and maintainable. Adopting these practices can contribute to avoiding code smells too.
The 5 SOLID principles are:
  S - The single-responsibility principle
  O - The open-closed principle
  L - The Liskov substitution principle
  I - The interface segregation principle
  D - The dependency inversion principle
Although the SOLID principles apply to any programming language, in further section I will be explaining each of them with examples written specifically in JAVA.
This principle states that “a class should have only one reason to change” which means every class should have a single responsibility.

有流量，简单解释就是：1）在新场景中高效率产生新内容，例如手机、VR 等；2）在新需求中高效率生产旧内容，例如 B 站、知乎、小红书等。
有钱赚比较好理解，即创作者可以通过自己的作品获得或多或少的收入。在过去的逻辑中，流量是一切的前提。
流量哪来？
创作者生产的内容最终目的都是给目标用户消费，两者会在不同的地方达成严肃（付费）或松散（关注）的契约关系，但在实际履行这些契约时会面临两个具体的问题：

两个同样喜欢周杰伦但使用不同音乐 app 的粉丝天然是不平等的：QQ 音乐的周杰伦粉丝可以随时收听他的音乐，但网易云音乐的粉丝却无法做到，有钱也不行。这与渠道方签署独家协议类似：作为一个创作者，是否愿意放弃履行在其他渠道的契约？
不同的内容发布渠道有各自的规则，因为日活、关注 feed 渗透率、算法以及平台运营和管理方向的关系，只有非常少的渠道可以让创作者发布的内容稳定送达给订阅者，因此我们总是会听到「我是不是被限流了」「怎么没有看到你的更新」这样的声音，让成功履约变的困难。

「流量 = 影响力，影响力 = 收入」已经成为当前创作者的金科玉律，目前市面上的流量一共就三种类型：公共流量（广点通、穿山甲等广告平台，花钱就能买）、平台流量（内容平台内部流量，算法和运营想给谁就给谁）、社交流量（微信、QQ 等自己可控的社…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文|邻章
造车，被视为是苹果进一步实现市值突破的关键举措，而在苹果历史战绩之下，业内更是预期苹果造车将高度整合硬件、软件和服务，颠覆当前汽车行业，再次改变游戏规则。
但从现实来看，苹果造车却似乎正处于利空频现阶段——密集的人事动荡、举棋不定的造车战略、受到挑战的供应链强势地位以及特斯拉已然树立起了电动汽车事实标准。
在业内高预期与现实境遇所形成的强烈反差之下，不由得让人疑惑：我们是否在幸存者偏差之下，高估了苹果的造车能力？

一、高度动荡的汽车管理团队
自苹果“Project Titan”计划以来，七年时间内，苹果汽车管理团队成员一直都处于高度动荡之中。
捋一捋苹果造车时间线，能够发现苹果汽车管理团队核心领导已经来到了由苹果机器学习副总裁John Giannandrea领导的第四代管理层，在其前面的三任领导人则分别是初代iPod团队领导人Steve Zadesky、苹果首席硬件工程师Bob Mansfield和原特斯拉工程高级副总裁Doug Field。
但苹果造车管理团队的动荡，不仅体现在核心领导的频繁更替，同时也体现在众多分项工程业务线领导的持续离职。
在此最新一例是苹果汽车软件工程主管Joe Bass，其在服务了苹果公司七年之后，转而加盟Meta公司，任混合现实技术的项目管理总监。虽然这被坊间戏称为是“造车已经没有元宇宙吸引人”的最新例证。
但于苹果而言，却可能是其造车计划进展不利的又一例证。毕竟综合业内报道来看，在Joe Bass离职之前，离职苹果汽车业务线的业内大牛还有诸如原宝马电动汽车研发Urlich Kranz、苹果汽车项目雷达系统的首席工程师Eric Rogers、原特斯拉软件主管CJ Moore、苹果汽车项目电池系统部门的工程经理Alex Clarabut、硬件工程经理Stephen Spiteri、以及领导汽车相关的机器人技术团队的Dave Scott、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“效率”，放置在个人和整体中，这是一个做事的时候皆需要考虑的词。在个人层面上，我们谈论“效率”时，通常它的前面会有一个修饰语，比如“学习效率”、“工作效率”。在我们说提高效率的时候，指的是在做一件事时，能够用更快的速度，更简单的方式实现它。高效也是一个大多数人都关心的话题，而且“如何利用各种效率工具让自己变得更高效”，似乎已经成为了一个预设好的、默认的好的事情。
在2021年，我也不出意外地使用了很多软件、尝试了很多种工具，主要包括知识的获取和整理，时间和日程的管理。与之前不同，我的一大改变是不再追求更复杂更齐全的功能，更倾向使用简单的、但可以达到核心需求的工具。
一、效率背后的逻辑
在聊具体的效率工具之前，我们先捋一捋效率背后的逻辑。
有效、无效和半有效时间
提高效率，换一个说法就是节省时间。从时间这个角度出发，我们先分解我们平时在工作和学习时花费的时间，看看我们到底把时间花在了哪里。如果把工作或者学习的时间摊开来看，可以把整块时间分成三块，分别是有效时间、半有效时间和无效时间。
有效时间指的是那些真正有突出的进展的时间，它只占整块时间的很小一部分。突出的进展就类似解决了某个bug，看懂了某个原理。这样的时间也可以被认为是做事时真正有用的时间。
所谓无效时间指的是做一件事情的过程中完全不用花的时间，这段时间纯粹是无用时间。举个例子，如果要使用远程服务器跑一段程序，那么设置IDE的远程连接可以说是在这个场景下最优的做法，而其他的方法，比如将代码文件传输到远程服务器再进行操作就可以说是一种更花时间也更不便利的做法，而后者所花费的无用的调试、修改、重新传输文件的时间，就可以被认为是无用时间的一种，它完全不创造任何成果。
然而在有效时间和无效时间之间，我认为还存在一种半有效时间。半有效时间指的就是表面上看起来并没有什么成效、但是却不可避免的出现在工作或学习的场景下的那些时间。半有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言 最近，在朋友圈各路大神的强烈安利之下，入坑了《开端》。不得不说，华语影视剧领域已经很久没有出现过这种带有科幻元素而又逻辑通畅的剧集了。在《开端》中，男女主角搭上了一辆载有一颗炸弹的 45 路公交车。一旦他们因为爆炸或是睡着而失去意识，便会发生时间倒流，他们也会重新回到还未爆炸的公交车上。主角团需要在这一次又一次的循环中，找到解救全车乘客的方法。这种无限时间循环的题材在以往国外的科幻剧作中并不少见，比较出名的例子有《源代码》、《忌日快乐》等。然而，《开端》仍然以新颖的剧情设计、严谨精致的细节与伏笔而广受好评。无论是在原著小说还是影视剧中，作者都没有提及时间循环发生的技术原理。因此，本文将尝试补全这一物理背景。我们将根据物理学家马尔达西那 (Juan Martin Maldacena, 1968－now) 与萨斯坎德 (Leonard Susskind, 1940－now) 于 2013 年发表的 ER = EPR 原理，阐述如何构造一台可能可以实现时光回溯的时间机器。
我们的基本逻辑是这样的：首先，在两个不同时刻制造处于量子纠缠状态的基本粒子；然后通过 ER = EPR 原理将这些纠缠粒子转化为连接这两个不同时刻的虫洞。这样，两位主角就可以在满足触发条件时，通过虫洞返回到炸弹还未爆炸时的公交车上。这种逻辑设定可以合理地解释为何会发生时间循环，以及为何循环不会提前到炸弹上车之前、为何肖的身体状态会越来越差等一系列原作者挖了却又填不上的坑。不过在此之前，我们需要先了解一下虫洞、量子纠缠、ER = EPR 等基础概念。
黑洞、白洞、虫洞
如果你关注科幻，那么我相信你一定不会对黑洞 (black hole) 这个概念感到陌生。在 2014 年上映的《星际穿越》中，科学顾问基普·索恩 (Kip Thorne, 1940－now) 及其团队利用数值相对论的计算为我们还原了一个相当真…]]></summary>

为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。
我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。
为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。
短信转发至 iPhone 效果
在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App
🔗 下载地址：App Store
Bark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 > Bark 服务端 > 苹果 APNs 服务器 > 你的设备 > Bark 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，app 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。
第一次打开 Bark 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 app 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。

这些术语被用于网络、编程、内核，甚至在非计算机领域，如供应链。当我们谈论上游和下游的时候，讨论背景是很重要的。

在其最简单的形式中，上游和下游是信息流动的方向。

由于我们都是在连接到互联网的情况下阅读这篇文章的，让我们看看适用于互联网服务提供商（ISP）的上游/下游例子。这里，ISP 关注的是流量。上游流量是指数据是从不同的 ISP 的用户处传来的。例如，如果你有一个提供订阅通讯的网站，我发送的订阅信息就是上游数据。

下游流量是指从一个用户发送到不同 ISP 的另一个用户的数据，它被认为是下游流量。使用同样的订阅例子，假设我的订阅请求被批准，我在一封邮件中收到“欢迎”说明，在又一封邮件中收到最新的新闻简报。在这种情况下，数据是顺流而下的，因为它是由你（好吧，可能是作为代表你进行操作的自动化软件）发送给我，一个来自另外 ISP 的用户。

总结：我需要或想要的东西（你的通讯）是上游的。你提供给我的东西（欢迎词和实际的通讯）是下游的。

数据是在上游还是在下游，对我们用户来说可能并不重要，但对监控带宽使用的服务器管理员，以及发行商distributor（发行版的制作者）和程序员来说却很重要。

在 Linux 世界里，上游和下游有两个主要背景。一个是关于内核的，另一个是关于应用程序的。还有其他的，但我希望我可以通过这两个来表达我的想法。

Linux 内核背景下的上游和下游

Linux 就是 内核。在创建发行版时，Linux 发行版首先使用未经修改的内核源代码。然后添加必要的补丁，对内核…]]></summary>

文/彭宏豪
 
Hello 各位好，我是小豪。
今天想和各位分享一个有意思的小项目——用快捷指令 App 和 GitHub，自动记录每天的起床时间。
这个项目源于之前介绍过的 running_page 作者 @yihong0618 的另外一个项目「早起记录」，它可以实现的效果如下：
每天起床关闭闹钟后，触发快捷指令 App 运行程序，在 GitHub issue 下面会生成一段话，包含今天的气温、起床时间（具体到秒）、随机的一句诗。

我觉得这个小项目挺有意思的，不仅可以记录每天起床的时间，还能体会到自动化程序在我们日常生活中的应用。
在项目作者 @yihong0618 老师的指导下，我也顺利了弄出了相同的程序，从此就可以记录我这只懒猪🐷的起床时间啦：

原作者 @yihong 0618 项目地址：
https://github.com/yihong0618/2021/blob/main/get_up.py
我的起床时间项目地址：
https://github.com/phh95/get_up
 
下面是实现自动记录起床时间的过程：
创建一个 GitHub 仓库
在 GitHub 上创建一个仓库，名字可以随意取，这里我将仓库取名为 get_up。

复制代码
从我的 get_up 仓库中复制 3 个文件，分别是：

.github/workflows 路径下的 get_up.yml 文件
get_up.py 文件
requirements.txt 文件

修改代码
打开复制的 get_up.py 文件，定位到第 11 行代码，你可以修改中间的「懒猪🐷起床啦，赶紧去跑步，上班不迟到。」，这里的语句，决定了最终在 issue 中生成的内容，你可以将它改为你喜欢的内容。

定位到第 50 行代码，如果你每天起床的时间早于 6 点，那就需要将 6 更…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
Flutter 是 Google 推出并开源的移动端开发框架，主打跨平台、高保真、高性能。开发者可以通过 Dart 语言开发 App，一套代码可以同时运行在 iOS 和 Android平台。
2018 年 12 月，Google 发布 Flutter 1.0。从那时候开始，Flutter 以迅雷不及掩耳之势，迅速崛起，并稳固了其在市场上的地位。
如今，Flutter 相关资源和社区都已渐渐成熟，得到了很多开发者和企业的信任。另外因为公司业务扩张，准备引入 Flutter 开发项目，所以学习 Flutter 势在必行，下面就跟着我的脚步进行 Flutter 的学习吧
一、Flutter 开发环境搭建
注意：本文以 macOS 系统为例
1）、使用镜像
由于在国内访问 Flutter 有时可能会受到限制， Flutter 官方为中国开发者搭建了临时镜像，我们只需将如下环境变量配置到用户环境变量中即可：
export PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://pub.flutter-io.cn
export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL=https://storage.flutter-io.cn

2）、下载 Flutter SDK
方式有 2：
1、直接去 Flutter 官网下载最新的安装包即可
下载地址：https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases?tab=macos#macos
2、通过 git clone 下载
git clone -b master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git

上述这句命令会将仓库克隆下来并切换到 master 分支
注意：上述两种方式第一种需要解压，第二种不需要，总之将它们放置到您想放的地方即可
3）、配…]]></summary>

Before we dive into the deeper learning of computer system, the best way getting a comfortable start is to see the bigger picture of computer system structure. I think it is important for the beginner who just start learning Computer System or Operating System.
Just like a hamburger, which has different layers like piece of bread, vagetables, beef, cheese and so on, computer systems also are dive into different layers. 
Layers in hamburger:

Layers in Computer Systems: 

As we can see, computer systems could be divided into three big layers, which are: (Up to down)
All kinds of applications that we use daily
2.Operating System Layers
Operating System -- A special application between software and hardware, which is used to transfer user's or applications' "codes" or "instructions" and then letting the hardware understand how to manipulate the menory.
3.Hardware Layers
Including CPU, disks, registers, RAM and so on.
Specially, and generally we can divede them into five main components (based on every single component could be dived deeper to study at the following chapters)
Input/Output ports. (I/O ports)


Central processing unit. (CPU)


Random access memory (RAM)


Secondary storage device (SSD)


Operating System (OS)






Next chapter, I will go over the , which is the basic knowledge in system, making you think like a computer. Hope you like it and subscribe it :)]]></summary>

CS professional development (PD). Tom's tweet was talking about virtual vs

general but the article actually led to some deeper issues with PD.
VAST majority of CS PD
is provided for by "content providers" - people with a product to
sell. That might be a curriculum, a technical platform, or both but
something to sell. It's not just CS knowledge and how to teach
it. I include organizations like code.org in this bucket because while
they're not selling in the same sense as a textbook publish, they are
selling or pitching their curriculum and platform.

Today we will be walking through the third installment of the series on How To: Build A Linked List. Here are the links to the first two installments: 1 and 2. Please feel free to read those if you haven't or reread to refresh your mind. 
We will be focusing on how to add insertion functionality via an insert() and traverse() method to our class LinkedList.
These two methods are definitely more challenging than the previous but together we are going to make them fully comprehensible and readable. 
Let's get started!
1. Mapping Out insert()
2. Checking Parameters
3. Creating a New Node
4. Build traverse()
5. Traverse the Linked List
6. Recap + Summary



Our insert() method is going to have 'index' and 'value' parameters. We need both parameters, because unlike append(…]]></summary>

In this article, I will share my experience freelancing lately and share insights.
Let’s jump right in!
Freelancing is selling services at a fee to people who need those services. Say you are a plumber in a big city or town, you could market yourself as a plumber who is available on call to fix leaking faucets, etc.
The same goes for copywriting, Software development, Graphic design, UI/UX design. 
The hardest work in freelancing is combining:
Interpersonal skills
Business skills
Technical skills (expertise)
Interpersonal skills involve communicating with clients being empathic with their needs and finding a better way to solve these needs.
Business skills on the other hand involve running a business- Market, paying bills, saving some money, and keeping the business running.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Set objects are constructed using new Set().
A set is a “set of " unique values. Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.
Sample code showing a simple Set object usage:
function main() {

    const gameScreen = document.getElementById('game-screen')
    gameScreen.addEventListener('click' updateAction)

    const cursorPositions = new Set()
    function updateAction(event) {
      let position = {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}
      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case
    }
    // use unique cursorPositions below
}

while(true) {
  main()
}

Duplicate values are discarded when added to a set. This is useful for capturing and storing unique values where duplicate values are not needed.
const letters = new Set()
letters.add('A')
letters.add('B')
letters.add('A') // duplicate entry is ignored
console.log(letters) // Set {2} {'A', 'B'} 

The set object provides a way of storing data where duplicate values are not required.
Note: Most languages including JavaScript offer a lot of language features but it’s not a good approach to try learning all these language features at a go. However, knowing they exist is enough as it helps one know where to look when the need arises.]]></summary>

In this blog article, we shall learn about map objects introduced in ES2015. Maps are key-value pairs, where the key can be of any type.
It's a typical practice in JavaScript to use Object literals as maps, most likely because Object literal predated Maps.
Map objects can be created using the new Map() keyword.
Sample code showing how to create a map object and add some values using Map.set():
const studentDetails = new Map()
studentDetails.set('age', 25)
studentDetails.set('class', 2018)
studentDetails.set('name', 'Naftali Murgor')

In object literal, the following would have been equivalent of the above:
const studentDetails = {
  age: 25, // made up
  class: 2018,
  name: 'Naftali Murgor',
}

Map offers useful helper methods compared to using object literal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, approximately 3 years ago I posted my first entry which tackled the question of what should I go next on my web developer career. 
At the time, I had finished a mid-size project with my employer, with the opportunity to choose a tech stack, design and develop the architecture of the application. It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.
Anyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that's the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.
Well then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for "production"). 
Hopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).
I don't think it's necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn. So now the next step is to take this experience and continue the journey. It's still just the beginning.]]></summary>

原文链接：https://developer.android.google.cn/studio/releases
Android Studio Bumblebee 作为一个新的大版本更新，其中包含许多新功能和改进。
支持 KMP 测试执行
现在可以在 Android Studio Bumblebee 使用 Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) 运行和测试。
为了确保 KMP 测试在 Android Studio 中成功运行，需确保项目满足以下所有要求：
AGP 7.0.0-alpha08 或更高版本
Gradle 6.8.2 或更高版本
Kotlin 插件 1.4.30 或更高版本
新设备管理器

设备管理器作为 AVD 管理器的替代品，为此也引入了一些新的功能，新添加的功能可以更方便地创建和管理所有本地测试设备，例如：
新的 UI 支持浮动或单独的窗口停靠在 IDE 上，就像使用其他 Android Studio 工具窗口一样，这样可以让开发者更轻松地访问自己的设备，而不会妨碍 IDE 的其他窗口。
Virtual tab 可以更方便地让开发者创建、管理和部署模拟器，更便捷地查看每个设备的详细信息，点击一下即可在 Device File Explorer 中快速检查设备。
Physical tab 可帮助开发者使用 ADB Wifi 快速配对新的设备，更便捷地查看每个物理设备的详细信息，另外你还可以通过单击按钮使用 Device File Explorer 快速检查每个设备的文件系统。
要打开新的Device Manager，可以执行以下操作之一：
在 Android Studio Welcome 中，选择More Actions > Virtual Device Manager。

        <updated>2022-01-25T14:35:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这次要重新测试一台机子，因为在上个月这台机子更新了一个重大功能，就是独显直连，这个功能算这台机子之前仅有的遗憾之一，也是不少发烧硬核用户特别关注的功能，所以这次特意借了一台机子更新测试，方便准备购机或者之前已购买的用户参考，这就是来自雷神的ZERO 英特尔酷睿版。

 
01/ 独显直连影响的不只是游戏
a.如何更新实现【独显直连】
雷神ZERO要实现【独显直连】功能，只能通过更新机子主板的【BIOS】（TP151或更新版）来实现，我这边简单说下整个流程供参考，具体也可以直接咨询官方技术客服。
1，更新BIOS：BIOS文件跟具体更新方式，直接咨询官方店铺客服或加官方群咨询管理员，按提示操作
2，确定更新成功后，关机，然后开机，开机过程反复按【F2】（不是一直按着）进入BIOS界面
3，进入BIOS界面后，方向键选择【advanced】菜单，第一个选项就可以选择独显模式为【Hybrid混合模式】或者【Discrete独显直连】，选择【独显模式】后，按【F10】保存退出，机子就成功切换为【独显直连】模式了。

开启【独显模式】之后，驱动界面就多了众多功能设置菜单

b.实现【独显直连】后有什么区别
如果你搜索【独显直连】，会告诉你这个功能主要影响是一些高帧数的竞技类游戏，比如FPS和MOBA类游戏，而对3A大型游戏影响不大，那么实际结果怎样，伴随这次更新，我顺带一起测试了【竞技类网游】、【3A大型游戏】、【GPU基准测试】跟【生产力应用】，综合看下这个功能带来的影响。
130W满血版RTX3060：雷神ZERO的性能释放算是挺大的优点，甚至可以说是TGL-H45+RTX30系列这一万金油组合的典范机型，无论CPU或者GPU或者组合功耗给的上限空间都算优异，比如GPU部分，专门针对 Dynamic Boost 2.0 进行了散热器的优化设计，既可以实现GPU130W满血释放，也…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[月初，高中学校的体协指导老师联系我，问说下周日是否有时间来当个裁判？接力赛缺个裁判员。具体要求就是做技术支持，即时给出比赛数据，制作成绩证书。觉得难度不大，虽然没有学过 Excel，但是现学现卖应该是没有问题的。所以接下了这个 case，并开始了准备工作。
先说结果，34 个队伍，204 名运动员，没有人对比赛成绩提出疑议。相比起去年人工计算时差、排名算了几天的情况，今年在比赛结束后 30 分钟左右，就发出了所有成绩排名。相比起同类小型赛事，没有制作成绩证书。本次比赛给每位运动员都制作了成绩证书，部分跑友还将证书一并发在了朋友圈，或者微信群中，大家对这次的比赛满意度较高。
首先介绍一下赛事背景，因为这是一场马拉松接力赛，正常马拉松全程是 42.195 公里，如果把它办成一场接力赛。一个队伍 6 个人，每个人需要跑 7 公里。而在我们区里，正好有这样的一个 U 字形场地，来回一圈刚刚好是 7 公里左右。

裁判组会分为 3 组，每组裁判配 4 个人，3 个人分工按下秒表计时，1 个人摄像记录对应的队伍。所以这样就会生成两组数据，一组是计时时间，一组是对应的队伍名字。而我的工作，就是将这两组数据汇总对应起来，然后填入 Excel 表格中对应的位置，最后计算出相关的时差、配速数据。
表格制作
明确需求
基本情况介绍完了之后，再看看老师安排的需求：

因为报过来的是总时间，所以需要计算每名运动员的个人计时
然后自动求出每位运动员的配速
在比赛结束后，给出个人全体排名、团队排名、男子组排名、女子组排名
给每位运动员制作完赛成绩证书

设计表格
需求明确之后，就可以开始设计表格了。先填入所有需要记录的关键信息，如下图所示。

其中跑团战队名称、姓名、性别前面三项是固定的，在此之前已经通过其他表格收集了这些信息，所以现在要做的，就是将这三项信息复制进来，得到以下结果。

Facebook 母公司 Meta 宣布 它正在建造世界上最快的 AI 超算 RSC。Meta 研究人员表示，新超算将能处理有数万亿参数的神经网络，相比之下 OpenAI 的自然语言处理神经网络 GPT-3 有 1750 亿个参数。新超算计划在今年年中完成建造，将使用 16000 个 GPU，储存容量达到 1 EB，能每秒处理 16 Tbps 的数据。


老王点评：这是为 Meta 宇宙准备的吧。




俄罗斯自研操作系统 Phantom OS 预计今年问世

俄罗斯花了 12 年研发的 Phantom OS 始于 2010 年，计划在今年推出原型操作系统，并创建基于 Genode 微内核的操作系统。其定位于 Linux 系统的竞争者，主打更好的性能，主要用于可穿戴及嵌入式设备。它有一个独特的“永不停机”的设计理念，可以将指定状态的快照存储到永久性存储设备中，一旦断电或者出现其他意外情况，系统可以回滚到最后一次状态并继续工作，好像一切都没发生过。


老王点评：所有宣称取代 Linux 的，最终都不了了之。




去年发生的数据泄漏事件远超历史记录

据一份 新发布的《2021 数据泄露报告》，在过去一年中共发生了 1862 起数据泄露事件，刷新了 2020 年（1108 起）和 2017 年（1506 起）的最高记录。报告还指出，涉及勒索软件的攻击在过去两年中每年都增加一倍，占 2021 年报告的网络攻击总数的 22%，按照这种增长速度，勒索软件攻击将超过网络钓鱼。


老王点评：勒索软件威胁已经成为了头号威胁，不过似乎国内企业对此的感受不深。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先说结论：
目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。


正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。
事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。
无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。
针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。
他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。
这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。
除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 
简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。


但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。
所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。
但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。
SAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: 

当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。
因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。
驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…
而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…
双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。


更多的的讨论可以关注我之前的一些回答：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文首发腾讯视频NBA公众号。

      连续七个主场的赛程，对于全联盟主场战绩第一的勇士队来说并不轻松。首个主场比赛日他们就爆冷输给了缺少四大主力的步行者队，随后面对西部倒数第一的火箭队，他们也只是靠着库里职业生涯的第一个压哨绝杀才赢下比赛。





今天的犹他爵士队，过去的八场比赛输掉了六场，没有戈贝尔的时候他们遭遇了四连败。戈贝尔回来后，米切尔又因为对阵湖人队时脑震荡开始休战。本赛季有米切尔的时候爵士队每百回合得118.3分，能排在联盟第一，没有米切尔的时候爵士队每百回合只拿到109.7分，是联盟第十九的水平。坐镇主场迎战缺少了头号得分手的爵士队，勇士队还是赢面很大的。





果不其然，勇士队在大多数时间保持着比分上的领先，第四节爵士队的反扑非常凶猛，可勇士队还是靠着最后4分钟防的爵士队只进了一个三分，赢得了比赛的胜利。全联盟防守效率第一的勇士队靠着出色的防守，将对手命中率压制到38.3%赢球，听起来合情合理。可勇士队球迷怎么还是面带愁容呢？


现在的库里，生涯最铁


和爵士的整场比赛，库里一直没找到他的投篮准心，20投5中，在三分线外13投1中。上一场打火箭尽管有着最后的绝杀，可其实库里也只有21投6中。连续两场比赛命中率都不足30%，这种事儿居然发生在库里身上，怎么可能呢？



 其实就在本月初，连续对阵热火和独行侠的比赛中，库里就交出了17投3中，24投5中，合计41投8中的表现。两场球下来命中率不足20%，创下了他自己连续两场的最低命中率记录。





 美国媒体statmuse做了项库里的投篮数据统计：职业生涯库里单场20次出手以上，命中率最低的7场比赛，有6场都发生在本赛季。去年12月，库里的三分命中率只有37.4%，但是今年1月，库里的三分命中率已经跌破30%大关（117投35中，命中率29.9%）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[将汽车轮胎按照地区分类，大致可以分为欧洲、北美、日韩、东南亚、中国。轮胎和所在地汽车工业息息相关，甚至间接决定了品牌定位。
典型如韩国，韩国汽车产品定位亲民家用，韩泰、锦湖也比较注重这方面。日本和美国是汽车老牌大国，两国汽车市场高度捆绑，所以两国轮胎品牌也主要以经济和越野为主。中国和东南亚地区的轮胎品牌，也都根据当地的汽车企业定位，诞生了比如玛吉斯、佳通、朝阳、玲珑等主要轮胎品牌。
欧洲有些不同的是，作为汽车的发源地，大量的运动赛事和跑车、豪华、家用、经济型汽车的全方位涉足，使得欧洲诞生了诸多性能顶级、品类全面的轮胎品牌，包括大家耳熟能详的德国马牌、米其林和倍耐力等。


选择合适的轮胎前，先搞清楚需求。
大多数轮胎品牌都有从上到下全面的布局，有经济、豪华、舒适、性能等各个系列，所以如果不是完全家用、经济趋向的车型，售价在15万以上，对操控、静音有些要求时就可以重点考虑欧洲品牌了。
问题是，一款轮胎不可能方方面面做到尽善尽美，如果有，那就是方方面面都不是最好。
如果在意成本，应该侧重考虑耐磨，但是耐磨一定程度上会影响舒适性和操控性，噪音也会增加。对于一些非入门车型来说有些得不偿失。出租车一般会倾向选择耐磨轮胎。
如果在意性能，比如领克03+、高尔夫GTI、宝马240i这一类的车子，需要重点考虑抓地力。抓地力好的轮胎可以有效提升车辆极限，相应的耐磨会变差。如果为了迁就耐磨，整车性能得不到发挥，事实上会造成更大的浪费。


如果是商务出行，比如别克GL8、奔驰V一类的车型，需要重点考虑舒适性。
如果是新能源车型或者豪华轿车，由于先天出色的静谧性或者对静谧性的高要求，应该侧重静谧性选择轮胎，以获得更加安静的乘坐感受。
有了需求就可以按图索骥选择产品了。多数汽车品牌有明确的系列划分，要理解一点都不困难，比如德国马牌旗下一共有三个大类：全能、运动和越野，命名规则是Conti-XXXX…]]></summary>

「快手饭」烹饪指南：即使熟悉的白米饭，也能做出新鲜感

🔋 充电量：125
作者：毛仔

人类种植稻米的历史起源于中国。大米作为市面上最常见也最为人所熟知的主食，经过数以千年记的发展、改良和创新，已经成为全球产量第二的食物。中国自古就有「鱼米之乡」等词汇，充分体现了大米对于中国百姓生活的影响。而法国名厨乔治斯·奥古斯特·艾斯可菲（1848–1935）也曾感叹：「米饭是世界上最好、最营养的——而且毫无疑问，它也是最普遍的主食。」由此不难看出，无论对于东方还是西方人，米饭都有着独特而浓厚的吸引力。
那么，作为一种看似平凡却又历史悠久的食物，我们又有哪些方法可以在家庭餐桌上折腾出新花样呢？今天本文就列举一些好吃又好看的碳水大餐！

编辑荐语（张奕源 Nick）：制作这篇内容期间，我派商城刚好上架了一款袁隆平大米，于是我便想到借此机会约作者制作一篇详谈大米烹饪的文章，最终就有了这篇米饭制作指南。
在打开文章之前，不少读者都以为文章只是单纯地讲怎么蒸大米的，实则不然。文中详细列举了大米的各种吃法，如煮粥、盖饭、包饭、炒饭等，每种做法都非常详尽，附有精美的配图。不仅如此，作者毛仔还充分考虑到了当代都市青年们没时间下厨的现实情…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google Chrome 无疑是 可用于 Linux 的最佳网页浏览器 之一。无论你在什么平台上使用它，它都提供了用户体验和功能集的良好融合。

另一方面，Brave 作为跨平台可用的、以隐私为中心的开源选项而广受欢迎。

那么，你应该选择哪一个作为首选网页浏览器呢？Chrome 适合你吗？谁应该使用 Brave？

在这里，我们比较了两种浏览器的所有重要方面（包括基准测试），以帮助你做出决定。

用户界面



Google Chrome 用户界面干净、开箱即用，没有不必要的干扰。

根据我的经验，默认情况下，它与 Linux 上的（GTK）系统主题融为一体。因此，根据你的自定义设置，它可能看起来有点不同。



如果你不在 Linux 上使用它，那么除了配色方案外，其他所有界面都基本相似。

而对于 Brave，它并不能开箱即用地适应你的系统配色方案。但是，你可以在它的外观设置里启用 GTK 主题。

Brave 与 Chrome 的用户界面接近，但有一些独有的调整/选项。



就用户界面而言，两者都不错，都很容易使用。

但是，Brave 提供了一些自定义外观的附加选项，例如删除选项卡搜索按钮（左侧到最小化按钮）、显示完整的 URL 等。



如果你觉得这对你有用，Brave 就更适合你。使用 Google Chrome，你在 UI 定制方面没有太多控制权。

开源与专有



Brave 是一个基于 Chromium 的开源网页浏览器。顺便说一句，我们还有一份 不基于 Chromium 的开源浏览器 的列表。

Google Chrome 也基于 Chromium，但它添加了几个专有元素，使其成为一个闭源产品。

虽然你可以期待 Brave 的开源和透明度带来的好处，但考虑到 Google 有专门的安全团队，他们在修补…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。
在2021年末，酷狗发布了最新版11.0.0版本，这是一次重大的UI重构，更新完打开着实让我耳目一新。在原有风格上，整个App变得更加清爽，流畅。其中Tabbar的风格让我非常感兴趣，如果用Flutter来实现，或许是一个很有趣的事情。
效果图


分析效果
研究酷狗Tabbar的动画可以发现，默认状态下在当前Tab的中心处展示圆点，滑动时的效果拆分成两个以下部分:
从单个Tab A的中心根据X轴平移到Tab B的中心位置；
指示器的长度从圆点变长，再缩短为圆点。其中最大长度是可变的，跟两个Tab的大小和距离都有关系；
指示器虽然依赖Tab的size和offset来变换，但和Tab却基本是同一时间渲染的，整个过程非常顺滑；
总的来说，酷狗的效果就是改变了指示器的渲染动画而已。
开发思路
从上面的分析可以明确，指示器的滑动效果一定跟每个Tab的size和offset相关。那在Flutter中，获取渲染信息我们马上能想到GlobalKey，通过GlobalKey的currentContext对象获取Rander信息，但这必须在视图渲染完成后才能获取，也就是说Tab渲染完才能开始计算并渲染指示器。很显然不符合体验要求，同时频繁使用GlobalKey也会导致性能较差。
转变思路，我们需要在Tab渲染的不断把信息传给指示器，然后更新指示器，这种方式自然想到了CustomPainter【之前写了很多Canvas的控件，都是根据传入的值进行绘制，从而实现控件的变化了layout类】。在Tab updateWidget的时候，不断把Rander的信息传给画笔Painter，然后更新绘制，理论上这样做是完全行得通的。
Flutter Tabbar 解析源码
为了验证我的思路，我开始研究官方Tabbar是如何写的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在经历一个多月的反复调整，解决了一系列重大 bug 后，One UI 4 正式版终于在十二月底重新开启推送，并在几天之内赶上了之前的预估进度。
目前 S21 系列、Note 20 系列与 Z 系列第三代新品已经可以体验到新系统的完全体了，除了系统版本升级为 Android 12，One UI 4 还带来了大大小小接近 80 项功能更新。在这篇文章中，我将选取其中较为重要的变化，赶在 S22 系列到来之前，简单介绍一下 One UI 4 带来的新气象。
本文基于 Z Flip3 与国行 S21 写作，实际体验在不同机型可能有差异，以实际功能更新为准。

紧跟 Material You，但还是星味满满
One UI 的设计风格一向非常具有辨识度，经典的方圆形（Squircle）图标让人一看便知。但同时，它也能紧跟 Google 提出的各种新设计标准，比如 One UI 3 中引入的 Android 11 毛玻璃效果。本次 Android 12 在 Pixel 设备中引入的 Material You 主题取色系统也同样被 One UI 4 成功化用。

One UI 4 内置了一个名为「调色板」的功能，在设置壁纸之后会跳出提示，以自动取色的形式设置系统主题色。

经过测试，你目前可以在电话、计算器、联系人、设置、时钟、提醒、我的文件、信息和智能管理器内观察到全局颜色调整带来的改变。但由于目前 One UI 并未采用原生 Android 12 以色块为主的设计，因此自动取色最直观的结果只呈现在系统设置内的开关与系统应用在默认启动器内的图标颜色上，以及通知栏快捷开关的按钮、锁屏与 AOD 的时钟字体颜色——但是后面这些选项即使在前几个版本的 One UI 中也均可以通过系统设置手动调整，因此目前 One UI 4 所呈现的效果更像是主题颜色「自动化」。Pixel Launcher 中…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在开头
笔者其实不太敢为陈朵作人物传记，因为陈朵的故事并不像一人之下作品中的其他人，可以作为普罗大众眼中比照自身的参考，她不同于张楚岚、诸葛青、王也这些普通人。
她是一个真正的“异人”，一个震撼人心的“人”。

陈朵的一生充满了各种崎岖坎坷，悲剧贯穿了她短暂的一生，但同时陈朵的人生又出离于普通人的生活，不论是作为她自己抑或是作为旁观者的我们都很难把陈朵归类普通人，她确实和这个世界格格不入，她是个“异类”。
只是她很幸运，能够在一群好人的守护下，幸运的活成我们看到的样子。
她也是个倒霉的孩子，无数次的机会她也可以不走向这样的结局。
但是陈朵的故事已经结束了，笔者觉得应该为她著书立说，盖棺定论。同时发生在她身上的诸多违和之处，也需要放在显微镜下仔细剖析。
最初她来到这个世界，是因为不得不来；最终她离开这个世界，是因为不得不走。——余华《活着》
起点：生而“异人”

如果说要在陈朵的悲剧里面找一个绝对的反派，那就一定是药仙会。
这个苗疆的会道门不愧是彻头彻尾的邪教组织。他们掳掠了各方面都极优秀的49个婴儿，从婴儿时期便以蛊毒喂食，在内脏种植蛊毒，还要抹除包括天性和人性在内的一切性情，最终用养蛊的方式让这49个孩子在自身蛊毒的厮杀间一一被淘汰，而最后唯一幸存者便是他们制造的所谓“蛊身圣童”。陈朵的这段过去正是她悲剧的起点，是至死都无法抹去的猩红底色。
2010年药仙会终于覆灭了，陈朵被公司“解救”出来，送入暗堡救治“改造”。
肉体的囚牢易解，心灵的枷锁难开。

药仙会的实验无疑是极为成功的，因为蛊身圣童完美的符合了他们设计实验之初的每一个要求，一个无视世间一切，只会制造蛊毒和接受指令的“工具”。
是的，工具，药仙会并不需要蛊童具有人的一切性情属性，甚至只需要开发出能够执行蛊身之术的理解力就够了。

就像那位血腥的资本家亨利福特的名言：“我需要的是一双手，为什么上帝给了我整个人”。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在开头
人物志系列停更许久，笔者本想先把陈朵人物志写完，但是思来想去，这个人物实在太火了，还是不凑那个热闹吧。
回望作品，笔者发现王也这个角色总能让人感触颇深，米二也愿意为他花费笔墨描绘他的人生轨迹，细腻之处甚至让笔者怀疑，王也就是米二理想中的自己。
他就像你我身边的一个朋友，在面上活得潇洒，混不吝，遇事有能量，有手段，年纪轻轻便走到了物质和精神两个层面的高峰。在骨子里他也温润如玉，豁达自在，哪怕怀璧其罪没有惶恐不安，哪怕力有未逮也始终放不下天下苍生， @天师道的白山正 说他和周圣合称”内圣外王“，这个”王“便是王也所行的王道。而在笔者看来，王也这个人物不仅仅是有其崇高的一面，他也有凡俗人的一面，相比“藏巧于贱”的张楚岚和“飞蛾扑火”的诸葛青，他向往逍遥世间的偷闲，也更是不愿沾染这世间的因果。
在笔者看来，王也其人，配得上”无为而无不为“一语。

生于安乐窝
王也作为中海集团老板王卫国的三公子，他的身家算得上出道即巅峰，投的一手好胎。
父亲的生意家大业大，父母还非常恩爱，生了三个儿子不够（王亦、王又、王也，瞧瞧这名字起的，啧啧啧），还想继续生闺女，甚至还有能助兴的蓝色小药丸，不得不说也总有一个幸福的原生家庭。

王卫国原型
此处有个小细节，王也的父亲叫做王卫国，出身行伍，上过边境，在部队里面也曾是吆五喝六的人物，其原型则是真实世界的两位牛人的混合体。
一位是王校长他爸，16岁就参军，17岁就到吉林省集安县的鸭绿江边成为了一名侦察兵，25岁就晋升排长进陆军学院进修，35岁则转业下海，62岁时登顶华人首富。这份经历和王卫国的人设不能说完全一致，只能说一毛一样。

另一位原型人物则是“玉帝专业户”，国家一级演员·真·王卫国。
先后在《西游记续集》、《宝莲灯》及《宝莲灯续集》中，饰演玉皇大帝一角，因此被广大观众熟知。有趣的是，正是因为王卫国扮演玉皇大帝的形象让人过目难忘，在以后的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这题我熟。
还剩不到一周就过年了，虽然现在过春节不如小时候热闹，但心里总归还是有点小激动的（毕竟有假放）。
如果没有疫情，全家一起出门玩儿已经成为一部分人过年的方式。
我挺推荐过年去北京的，原因嘛自然是因为北京的年味儿浓，那些红墙已经把气氛拉满，再配上大街小巷里各种灯笼和糖葫芦，不用放刘德华的《恭喜发财》过年的感觉就出来了。


而且北方冬天有雪有冰，可以看冰灯会、玩滑雪、泡温泉，还有新年集市可以逛，能把新年过得很有实感。


今年年初四是冬奥会开幕式，不知道防疫政策会不会因此变得更加严格。不管如何还是想分享一下北京过年攻略，万一用得上呢。我估计原地过年的人也不在少数，这下正好可以好好感受京味儿十足的过年气氛。



去永宁古城赶个大集
永宁古城位于延庆，距市区大约2小时车程。它不是那种商业化的景点，里面的老建筑都是货真价实的，据说从唐代开始就有这座城了。



永宁古城之所以出名，也是因为这里每天都会有集市。平时的周末节假日就有不少特地来赶集的人，过年期间当然会更热闹一些。
集市和商店主要分布在主街上，卖啥的都有，爆米花、糖画、糖葫芦……集中看到这些东西，年味儿直接就扑到面前了。



淘货也赶集的乐趣之一，虽然主街不长，但各色摊位密集，从吃的到用的统统可以买到，价格也都不贵，正好可以采办些年货。周末的上午是最热闹的，建议大家安排好时间去玩。




对了，别忘了顺路吃古城最有名的小吃：火勺和豆腐。火勺有点像烧饼，但是会带一点椒盐味，中间夹肘子肉很好吃；永宁豆腐是用酸浆点的，加上这里水好，做出来的豆腐滑嫩又鲜美。



过年前后北京城的庙会和市集应该还挺多的，各位北京土著如果知道类似的集市欢迎留言安利。



去景区热闹过节
每年新年北京的几个景区都会有固定的活动，大家凑在一起热热闹闹地过节也不错，很适合带家人或是小朋友一起去玩。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenBoard 是为中小学和大学定制的交互式开源白板。让我们来看看它提供了什么。




有几个可用于教育的开源工具，但是，并非所有这些面向中小学和大学的软件都能达到商业软件级的良好维护。

OpenBoard 就是这样一个不同凡响的自由开源工具，它可以不打折扣地为教育服务。它是一个交互式白板程序，具有所有基本功能，并支持各种硬件。

OpenBoard：自由及开源的交互式白板



作为一个自由开源的程序，OpenBoard 看起来是一个令人印象深刻的选择。

瑞士日内瓦州的教育部门（DIP）与 GitHub 上的社区一起维护该工具。

通过交互式白板促进简单的数字教学不应该花费很多，这就是 OpenBoard 的优势所在。

它提供的一系列功能对大多数中小学和大学来说应该是足够的。

虽然我无法在中小学/大学环境中测试它，但我会重点介绍它提供的主要功能。

OpenBoard 的特点



交互式白板没有众多花哨的功能，但足以使教师能够尽可能轻松地表达自己。

我注意到的一些特点包括：


跨平台支持

能够自由地写写画画

能够添加注释

能够删除注释

可以使用荧光笔高亮显示你的白板的部分区域

单独互动和移动创建/绘制的项目

按顺序添加多个页面，可以继续教学而不需要擦除

能够在页面间滚动浏览

绘制线条（从三种不同线宽中选择）

切换手写笔模式（如果你使用的是手写板或类似的东西）

轻松擦除在白板上创建的项目

可以从一组不同的背景中选择，包括把它变成黑板或带网格线的背景

各种必要的应用，包括计算器、地图、尺子等，都可以通过拖放使用

提供的一些形状，可以使绘图更容易

能够向你的白板添加音频/视频，并无缝播放，以获得更好的体验

虚拟激光笔

可放大和缩小

书写文字，调整大小，并克隆它

从白板中对屏幕进行截图

需要时可使用虚拟键盘


在我简短的测试中，用户界面和可用的选项工作得非常好，没有任何故障。



当然，你的体验将取决于设备的类型和你的设置。你可以用 Wacom 平板、双显示器设置，或者通过支持触摸的笔记本电脑使用投影仪来尝试。

在 Linux 中安装 OpenBoard

更好的是，它可以在多个平台上使用，包括 Windows、macOS 和 Linux。

如果你使用的是 Ubuntu，你可以到官方网站下载 DEB 文件。另外对于其他 Linux 发行版，你可以选择通过 Flathub 安装 Flatpak 软件包。


OpenBoard


结语

总的来说，我发现它在使用和导航方面毫不费力。你可以在多个页面之间快速切换，无缝擦除/添加项目，同时还可以在白板上添加丰富的元素。

通过虚拟激光笔以及一些应用，使得它适合在各种中小学和大学中使用而没有任何障碍。

我不知道它是否可以被称为谷歌课堂或 Miro 白板功能的替代品，但对于更简单的使用，OpenBoard 可以胜任。

如果你还没有试过，我建议你试一试。你知道有什么比这更好的东西吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一名重度数码发烧友来讲，我每天都会花很多的时间呆在我的书桌前摆弄各种数码产品。最近新房子装修完毕，各种家具都陆续到了我也开始我新桌面搭建的过程。这里也和大家分享一波从0到1的桌面搭建过程，也分享一下这一波我的新桌面都有哪些数码好物。
这次桌面搭建有了之前多次的经验所以在选择上有不少产品是我之前就一直在用的，这次搬入新家之后复购的产品。对我内容有印象的小伙伴应该对下面这个桌面有印象，这大概是2020年的时候在我原先家里卧室搭建的一套让我用了很久的桌面。当时的人体工学座椅就是网易严选之前的明星产品，被老罗卖爆了的网易严选经典款以及网易严选的电动升降桌面。

 
有了之前的良好体验，所以这次就复购了这款电动升降桌。毕竟之前附送免费上门安装、以及双电机的稳定体验都给我留下了深刻的印象。而且这次复购也没让我失望，当然如果现在网易严选这款电动升降桌可以推出一款更大尺寸的我就更开心了。毕竟相比网易严选的人体工学座椅的更新频率来讲，距离上次购买也一年多的时间了。这款网易严选的电动升降桌依旧也只有1.2m和1.4米、白色和胡桃色两种配色可选。在这个价格上都已经安排双电机了，为什么不升级一个1.6m甚至1.8m 桌面尺寸的版本给用户选择呢？

 
桌面清单：

主机：MBP 16.1 2019款+各种PC主机
显示器：明基PD2705U
充电设备：贝尔金108W四口氮化镓快充+15W苹果magsafe磁吸二合一无线充电器
灯光：飞利浦 Hue 照明组合
外设：海盗船RGB航海主题机械键盘+K65 RGB Mini+DARK CORE RGB PRO SE暗影（可以无线充电的无线鼠标）
桌面：网易严选电动升降桌 白色 1.4m*0.7m
座驾：网易严选星舰特别定制人体工学座椅（之前就有）

相比之前的桌面风格来讲，这次最大的变化可能就是 RGB 灯光元素的加入。自己一直很想做的就是给桌面增加…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是 Github 开源 GSY 系列项目的负责人郭树煜，比如 Android 上的 GSYVideoPlayer 就是这个系列里的项目，另外我也是 《Flutter 开发实战详解》 的作者，平时主要活跃在 Github 和掘金平台，这次主要是给大家分享移动端音视频开发和 GSYVideoPlayer 的一些有趣的内容。
基础知识
首先是基础知识，本次分享在这一块会占据很大比例，为什么要和大家聊音视频的基础知识？这就又要考古我很久前的一个经典 issue ，如图所示：

在维护 GSYVideoPlayer 这 5 年多的时间里，关于类似的基础的问题其实收到不少，只是这个比较典型，而处理这些问题的流程都是类似，举个例子，我收到最多的视频播放问题应该是
“播放黑屏，播放失败，xxx能播为什么GSY不能播？”
每次遇到这种问题的时候，我都会问：
“视频编码是什么？”
而很大概率我收到的回复就是 ：
MP4
之后就需要进一步去解释： “MP4 不是视频编码，要如何去查看视频编码...” 这样的一个流程。
所以关于音视频的基础常识，也是我最经常科普的内容，这部分内容其实也很多，这里就挑选一部分常见或者我比较经常解释的给大家分享。
封装

如图所示，一般情况下，视频流从加载到准备播放是需要经过解协议、解封装、解编码等这样的过程，其中：
协议指的就是流媒体协议；
封装是的是视频的封装格式；
编码又分为视频编码和音频编码；
常见的协议一般有 HTTP 、RTSP、RTMP 等，其中最常见的就是 HTTP 网络协议，而 RTSP 和 RTMP 一般用于直播流或支持带有控制信令的场景，比如远程监控；当然 HTTP 也有可以支持直播的，比如 HLS （也就是我们常见的 m3u8）。
视频封装协议指的是我们常见的 MP4 、AVI 、RMVB 、MKV、FLV 等常见后缀格式，它们所表示…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[序言
这一年和去年一样，在工作上并没有多少的起色，反倒是越睡越晚，不到3点完全不困。而当花了好几K在医院全身折腾了一遍，最终被诊断为神经衰弱后，你会发现或许平平淡淡也不错吧。然后就是强身健体，改变饮食节构，尽量早睡早起不熬夜。

这些唠叨其实和我接下来的内容没啥关系，只是提醒各位小伙伴要注意身体，少点外卖多泡脚。

接下来的内容源自前段时间有小伙伴在私下问，楼主，请问你桌面上的那个睡猫是啥？
见问的朋友多了，我就干脆开一篇小合集，解答这个睡猫的问题，顺便展示一下我手头用的一些小玩意，以及兼职型设计师的心头好物。


JXK嗜睡猫模型

我选的是三花猫，但居然有蛋蛋，在我印象中三花不是母的吗？感觉很特别。

模型使用树脂一体成型，开箱并无异味。表面的毛发细节相当优秀，不过也导致很容易沾染灰尘。脸部细节刻画很优秀，不过那胡子和眉毛是粘上去的，万千不要扯它。

平时没事就拿刷子给它刷一下，深夜工作时看着它睡得这么舒服，很想知道今晚它又梦见了什么。作为一个桌面摆件很值得入手，价格方面包含了底部的毛绒布垫。

5键够用，有线迷你键盘
并不是自嘲讽，而是真的只有5个键的迷你键盘。开始是考虑用3键就行了，毕竟也就Ctrl+C，再Ctrl+V，但感觉多个Ctrl+Z撤销会更好用，然后第5个键还可以加个ESC。

如果按价格来说，这迷你键盘并不便宜，一个键约9元左右，可以选青轴、红轴、茶轴、黑轴等各种轴体。当然，手感上面不要太过追求，但整体又相较普通键盘好用些。

5个键位可以通过软件自由调整，可以设定为任何键位，包括功能键、鼠标、媒体键和组合键，也就是说其实并不需要同时按下两个键，只单按一个键也可达成Ctrl+V的效果，只不过两个键更具仪式感。

光效方面支持按下点亮和跑马灯效，深夜使用时也还不错。

拍照前放个立方蜘蛛或色卡
而为了后期更省事些，在拍照时我都会摆放一个Datacolor的…]]></summary>

上海又撞上疫情，连续三年春节不能回家，对父母始终有些亏欠。
昨天（春节前 10 天），收到微信的提示，提示使用定制红包封面。
突然发觉这是个好主意。不能回家，那帮父母做个红包封面。自己似乎也随着红包，跟父母一起给亲戚拜年。

红包封面的设计并不复杂，小白也能轻松设计。不过前提是，要有个 100 粉丝的视频号或公众号。
接下来介绍下，微信红包定制的整体流程。
红包封面额度
微信发了 2000 个红包封面，足够我帮家里每个人定制红包的。
值得注意的是，封面会在 2022 年 2 月 1 日 23:59 过期，只能在大年初二前使用。
微信红包团队的生意算盘太响了。这活动，不但给红包封面带来大量新用户，后期也能让不少人续费红包时间。

没用获取红包封面额度也没关系，可以自行购买。封面费用是 1 元/个，购买 n 个则 n 个用户可以使用此款红包封面，有效期半年。
封面平台注册
领取定制红包额度后，提示登录到 微信红包封面开放平台。
首次使用封面平台，需要注册并认证。如果你是用个人身份认证，注册中无付费环节。

个人认证，需要100粉丝的视频号或公众号。

注意，绑定的个人微信号需要实名认证。
红包封面设计
注册成功后，即可定制红包封面。
微信提供了 psd 和 sketch 的红包封面模板，流程参考 微信红包封面官方文档。
不懂设计模板能不能用？
可以的。
零基础用小画家，有图层概念则用 Figma。
不管工具如何，你上传图片，即可完成红包设计。
示例基础图片 (推荐手写字体：杨任东竹石体)
封面注意事项

红包封面会展示公众号名称和头像。名称一年可修改两次，头像一个月可申请修改 5 次。因为红包是给家人用的，不方便展示公众号信息。我选了个不用的公众号，把名称和头像都修改了。
红包审核需要 3 个工作日，距离春节也已经很近了。如果你想在春节使用定制红包，尽快申请审核三个红包封面，避免最后关头未通过。
如果微信红包封面中出现肖像，需要授权。拜年红包还是希望有全家福，我提交了资料，但通过几率不大。

完成后的红包：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[何为黑色电影之黑
法国影评人定义了黑色电影，他们从四十年代美国电影中归纳出这种风格。到五十年代末，奥逊·威尔斯执导的[历劫佳人]宣告了经典黑色电影时期的终结，随之而来的是所谓的新黑色电影——彩色取代黑白、黑色元素和主题融入某个类型化叙事中——犯罪、惊悚、科幻、恐怖等。黑色电影概念包含了一系列视觉和影像风格以及特定的主题——犯罪和荒诞。所谓黑色，既强调视觉，也强调叙事和主题。

从社会性源起来说，黑色电影是对二三十年代约翰·福特、弗兰克·卡普拉等导演所信奉的美国中产社会价值的反叛。底层、中产阶级、警察、女人等，或是陷入腐化堕落的罪恶环境，或是走向犯罪深渊。黑色电影虽然鲜少直接谈论宏大的政治、社会问题，但它们或多或少从这些问题中，产生了创作的冲动和灵感。源自人性的贪婪和腐败是导致主角犯罪或堕落的根本原因。
回看美国经典黑色电影，“黑色”之意并不难领略。它们大多是讲犯罪故事，或是与人性的阴暗面有关，让人感到既危险又迷人。主角只是普通人，而非穷凶极恶的帮派人物，或是被逼无奈的反抗者。
一般来说，1941年的[马耳他之鹰]在好莱坞刮起了黑色电影之风。从类型上来看，它是一部侦探电影，但具备了与该类型电影不同的黑色主题——不是聚焦于一般意义上的犯罪或悬疑解密，而是透过侦探之手，发现罪恶背后，道德和人性的失衡。

当侦探、女主和犯罪团伙的老大围在传说中用金子制作的马耳他之鹰周围时，他们的目光聚集了贪欲，但影片在此又狠狠黑色了一把：众人搭上几条性命，互相欺骗和斗争而争夺回来的宝物，却是一文不值的东西。
这种历经千帆后，被宿命击中的荒诞，亦是黑色电影迷人的地方。与女主暧昧的侦探，最终向警察告发了她的罪行。这是早期黑色电影的“保守”之处(因为海斯法典，好莱坞当时对性、变态、犯罪、暴力的表现还有很多禁忌)，摇摆的道德最后要回到正轨，作恶者自食其果。
在[双重赔偿][失去的周末]和[日落大道]里，导…]]></summary>

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are tokens that are unique and cannot be interchangeable. They are different from other tokens because they can represent unique assets or digital collectibles. Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
NFTs and Smart Contracts on the Blockchain
NFTs and smart contracts are two of the most important features of the blockchain. They are what make the blockchain a powerful tool for creating and managing digital assets. NFTs are stored on the blockchain in a decentralized manner, which means that they are not controlled by any single entity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi welcome to part 2 of the comprehensive guide to Svelte.
In this article, we will be learning how to fetch API data using Svelte. We will be using the GitHub API to fetch data about repositories.
First, we need to install the Svelte npm package.
$ npm install svelte
Next, we need to create a file called app.svelte.
`



GitHub Repository Data





const url = "https://api.github.com/repositories";
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open("GET", url, true);
request.onload = function() {
const data = resp.body.data;
console.log(data);
}
};
request.send();
`
In the code, we first define the URL for the GitHub API. We then create a new XMLHttpRequest object. We open the GET request and set the URL. We also set the true parameter, which ensures that the request is made asynchronously.
We then define two functions, onload and onerror . onload will be executed when the request is loaded, while onerror will be executed if there is an error. We then send the request.
If the request is successful, we will get the response body. We will then extract the data from the body and log it to the console. 
You can try running the code in your browser. You should see the data for all the repositories on GitHub.
Thanks for reading ☺️

Svelte is a new JavaScript framework that is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. 
Svelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. 
One of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. 
Svelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. 
Svelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient. If you are looking for a new JavaScript framework, Svelte is definitely worth considering.

Delaying
Lambda is event-driven, meaning it starts running when an event triggers it. Because of this, it does not support delaying that event and start processing at a
later time.
While it could wait as part of its code, that is an expensive operation as you need to pay for the total runtime of the function multiplied by the memory
allocation. Also, the maximum time a function can run is 15 minutes. In theory, you could use a small Lambda for waiting and call itself to extend the hard
execution limit, it is more of an interesting development challenge than a realistic approach.
In AWS, you can use Step Functions to solve this instead. It is an orchestration service that allows you to define a workflow as a state machine and it can

Pointer cursors were invented to indicate links on the Web. It is tempting to adopt them for all active elements in apps that use web technologies, like we initially did. However, after a thorough research, we decided to say goodbye to pointer cursors.
Speaking of design: we—and our beta users—didn’t like the default title bar in the desktop app. It wasted space and didn’t fit our custom design – the entire window should blend in with the app’s personality. And now, starting with macOS, it does:

So when we came across a brilliant article about hiring autistic talent, we knew we had to have its author Matt Nigh on the podcast. Matt is one of the most prominent thought leaders on neurodiversity in the workplace.
Matt himself was diagnosed with autism late in life following a very unique job interview at Google. He’s since spent countless hours researching, writing and talking about how companies can not only bring neurodiverse talent into the fold, but why engineering teams thrive when they do.
In this episode of Dev Interrupted we talk with Matt about best practices in recruiting, hiring and working with neurodiverse coders, how his interview at Google interview led to an autism diagnosis, the ways Matt’s data team at the University of Washington is helping combat COVID and what private companies can learn from the ROI metrics of universities and public institutions.
Dan and Matt also took some time to geek out about GitLab.
We hope this conversation was as enlightening for you as it was for us and we hope it helps you find your next great hire.

Ethereum is a network of computers which collectively form the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which updates the state of the Ethereum blockchain. A blockchain is a publicly available and distributed database, which acts as the memory of the EVM. One role of this memory is acting as a ledger, saying who owns how much Ether, the cryptocurrency supported by the Ethereum network. The computers participating in this network are called “nodes” or “miners”, and the computational power they contribute is what keeps the EVM running. For their work, they are rewarded with Ether, hence the term “miners”. The EVM can also run programs called “smart contracts”, which are programs stored on the blockchain and run on the EVM.

在操作应用的时候，会有很多不同的手势操作，如按下、单击、双击、长按等手势，我们可以在这些手势事件中添加相应的业务逻辑，那么如何检测不同的手势操作就比较重要了，本文将带大家了解如何使用GestureDetector进行手势检测。
2.进行手势检测
2.1 创建GestureDetector
进行手势检测之前，需要先新建GestureDetector对象，示例如下：
gestureDetector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.OnGestureListener() {
    @Override
    public boolean onDown(MotionEvent e) {
        log("onDown");
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void onShowPress(MotionEvent e) {
        log("onShowPress");
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent e) {
        log("onSingleTapUp");
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onScroll(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float distanceX, float distanceY) {
        log("onScroll");
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void onLong…]]></summary>

If you frequent DEV Community or have ordered from our shop, you have likely seen me around. I originally joined the DEV Team in June of 2019 as a Business Development and Growth Intern. Although I had been an intern for some time, my colleagues have always respected me as a significant part of the team through-and-through. 
Two-and-a-half years later, I graduated from The College of New Jersey with my Bachelor's in English. Now, I'm becoming a part of the DEV Team full-time as a Developer Marketing Associate! It's a really exciting change and I'm looking forward to every part of it. 
Between work and school, I have not had a lot of time to improve my programming skills and engage with the community on a personal level. I hope to change this over the course of the next few months. I'm certain you will all be seeing more of me as I tackle this new position. Wish me luck!
If you have any questions or comments — or just want to chat — don't hesitate to reach out! Shoot me an email or a DM on the DEV Community Discord (Where I'll be waaaaay quicker to respond to you. Join if you haven't yet!).]]></summary>

You probably know what happened to Faker.js around two weeks ago.
In collaboration with Netanel Basal, I created a new mock data generator lib to provide a quick, suitable replacement for those relying on Faker (including us).
✅ 160+ Functions ( at the time of writing)
There was a lot of community effort put into building this library. In just two weeks, we accomplished:
✨ A whopping 1.6k Github Stars
I want to thank everyone who took part in this, you rock!
Give Falso a try and let me know what you think 🌟
 / 
        falso
      
    




All the Fake Data for All Your Real Needs 🙂
Create massive amounts of fake data in the browser and NodeJS. Tree Shakeable & Fully Typed.






✅  164 Functions
🤓 Learn about it on the docs site 
Stackblitz
npm i @ngneat/falso
yarn add @ngneat/falso



Usage
import { randEmail, randFullName } from '@ngneat/falso';

const user = { email: randEmail(), name: randFullName() };

const emails = randEmail({ length: 10 });
You can set your own seed if you want consistent results:
import { rand, seed } from '@ngneat/falso';
seed('some-constant-seed');

// Always returns 2
rand([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in a scrum team for a while, and later I saw other developer teams working in an old school way. Here are things I've noticed.
senior developers aren't approachable, working in silos. Many cases don't show up for weeks. 


junior devs onboarding lasts feom 6 months to a year, and after that still have gaps in knowledge about product.


developers chase each other on chat for bugs introduced. Changes therfore reverted including improvements.


Developers work on ad-hoc tasks, interrupted by client support with nonsense issues.


client support has no understanding of iasues and can't replicate it befoee pasaing on to devs.


clients calling developers on the phone.


dev team manager coding


no version control. Backups restored, changes lost, task solved become unresolved.


tickets contain multiple tasks, often left halfway done and closed.


templates arent updated as per latest data changes, old code commented out, duplicate codes.


developers aren't aware what the rest of the team is working on. 



I'm not saying this is bad, it's not wfficient. Junior take a long time to -if ever- understand the whole project and their skills remain unexploited. Validity of development can only be seen when task is completed, so if it's worthless, then all the time and work went down the toilet. The product isn't evolving, only the codebase becomes larger.]]></summary>

「2022 年什么会火？什么该学？本文正在参与“聊聊 2022 技术趋势”征文活动 」
Android 诞生已久，其开发方式保持着高频更迭，相较于早期的开发方式已大不相同，尤其是近几年 Google 热切推崇的 MAD 开发技术。其实很多开发者已经有意或无意地正在使用这门技术，借着 2022 开年探讨技术趋势的契机，想要完整地总结 MAD 的愿景、构成、优势以及一些学习建议。
MAD，全称 Modern Android Development：是 Google 针对 Android 平台提出的全新开发技术。旨在指导我们利用官方推出的各项技术来进行高效的 App 开发。有的时候 Google 会将其翻译成现代安卓开发，有的时候又翻译成新式安卓开发，个人觉得前者的翻译虽然激进、倒也贴切。
下面按照 MAD 的构成要点逐步展开，帮助大家快速了解 MAD 的技术理念。如果大家对其中的语言、工具包或框架产生了兴趣，一定要在日后的开发中尝试和掌握。

【Jetpack】讲述 Android 持续更新的重大框架集合，并逐个演示重要框架解决的问题和优势
【Jetpack Compose】带领大家感受 Android 上 UI 开发方式的重大变革

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。
我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。
为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。
短信转发至 iPhone 效果
在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App
🔗 下载地址：App Store
Bark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 > Bark 服务端 > 苹果 APNs 服务器 > 你的设备 > Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。
第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。
Bark App
在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder
🔗 下载地址：酷安
SmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。
打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。
将Bark设置为发送通道
返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。
设置短信转发规则
除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。
为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️
出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。
示例：realme UI 后台权限设置
出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。
realme UI 验证码安全保护
将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac
根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。
总结
得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。
如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。

PhoneCast：将你的 iPhone 屏幕投射到 Mac 上

平台：iOS / iPadOS / macOS
关键词：投屏、演示

@化学心情下2：PhoneCast 是一款可以将iOS 设备屏幕投射到 Mac 上的工具，其原理也很容易理解——通过 iOS 内置录屏功能将画面录制并直播，而 Mac 端则通过接收并回放的形式在桌面通过窗口展示出来，从而间接的实现了 iOS 屏幕投射到 Mac 上。

操作上也不复杂，在 iOS 端和 Mac 端分别安装 PhoneCast，Mac 作为接收端只需要运行并放置到后台即可，而 iOS 端只需要在首页中点击 Power to Start boradcast，之后在「直播屏幕」中选中 Phonecast 后点击 「开始直播」，等待直播开始后即可将 Phonecast 放到后台运行；如果 Mac 和 iPhone 处于同一个局域网，那么你会很快在 Mac 桌面看到一个显示 iOS 桌面的窗口，你在 iOS 上的操作都会同步在 Mac 上的这个小窗口显示。

当然这样直接的投射虽然能用上，但你可以看到画面并不清晰，因此你也可以通过解锁内购的方式来开启高画质投屏，对应地你还可以通过购买订阅的方式来开启所有高级功能，比如说自动根据手持方向旋转投屏的画面，只投射声音等等。而在开启高画质之后，则需要注意…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以后可以在 Linux 应用中看到（很多）广告了

Qt 宣布支持客户端应用程序中的广告，应用程序开发人员现在可以在桌面应用程序中提供 广告服务，而这通常是 Windows 用户的待遇。Qt 被广泛使用在桌面应用程序开发中，KDE 就是基于 Qt 框架开发的。虽然估计不会在 KDE 的核心应用程序中看到广告，但有可能一些急于挣钱的发行版会将这些应用程序分叉，在其中放置广告。根据其文档，该广告插件支持所有主流平台，包括 Windows 和 Linux 等等。


老王点评：这个消息让我一时不知道该怎么说，一方面确实可以补贴一些开源开发团队，另外一方面充斥着广告的 Linux ，怎么都感觉不对劲。




自毁代码库的作者要求恢复其发布到 NPM 的能力

Faker.js 的原作者在 自毁 了其两个重要的开源代码库之后，GitHub 和 NPM 一度封禁了他的账户并回滚了其提交的恶意版本。之后 GitHub 恢复了他的账户，而一些社区贡献者 复刻 了他的 Faker.js 项目，并提出了积极的发展路线图。而该作者在 Twitter 上 抱怨称，GitHub 取消了他向 NPM 发布和修复错误的能力，一直没有恢复。他称其还有一百多个包要维护，并委婉地承认了错误：“每个人都会时不时地犯编程错误。没有人是完美的。”


老王点评：公平的讲，虽然该作者的行为不合情理，但是 GitHub 和 NPM 也没有强行封禁的权利和理由。




Linux 供应商固件服务考虑为老旧设备提供开源固件

开发者提议，由 Linux 供应商固件服务（LVFS）这样的实体为已经过了保修期的硬件提供自由开源的固件。这涉及到一些法律问题，而且这样的举动可能不会得到硬件供应商的认可。到目前为止，由于法律要求、良好的安全模式等原因，LVFS 完全依赖于 ODM/OEM 为其硬件上传固件。对于没有经验的用户来说，通常不是很容易自己操作闪存。而采用 LVFS 可以使你更容易地关闭系统的专有固件，并在支持的情况下切换到自由固件。如果用户接受采用第三方固件的风险，这样也为挽救过保的硬件提供了可能。


老王点评：我觉得这是一种有益的尝试。]]></summary>

超级马力欧派对

《超级马力欧派对》充分活用了 Switch 的各项机能特性，为这个经久不衰的同屏多人游戏系列，又增添了新的活力。本作提供了多达 80 种小游戏，其中不少都将 Joy-Con 玩出了花；每位玩家只需要手持单个 Joy-Con，就可以又扭又甩地参与进来。

是想在小棋盘中用各种小游戏一较高下？抑或是要考验大家的节奏感？还是打算在「河川生存战」中与其他玩家劲往一处使，齐心协力突破难关？从传统的小游戏 PK，到新颖的合作体验，《超级马力欧派对》统统囊括，定能让你（和其他玩家）感受到只属于 Switch 的派对乐趣。

游戏平台：Switch
玩家人数：最多 4 人
参考售价：429 港币（港版）、299 元（国行）

马力欧派对 超级巨星

和强调体感，活用机能的《超级马力欧派对》不同；《马力欧派对 超级巨星》将重心放到了系列的「传统艺能」，类似大富翁的棋盘游戏上。《超级巨星》收录了 5 张各具特色的经典棋盘，每张棋盘皆有着独特的事件与机关；四名玩家各自掷骰前进，靠小游戏赚取用于置换星星的金币，最后比拼谁的星星与金币数量最多 —— 但就像前面说的那样，这些地图可不简单。好好利用的话，也许能获得意想不到的大反转——？

说到小游戏，本作收录的数量多达 100 款；它们皆是从历代作品中精选而来，并且和棋盘一样…]]></summary>

在中国人的食谱中，烧烤是最特殊的存在。代表餐桌审美的川、鲁、粤、淮扬等大菜系里，几乎找不到烧烤的影子。无论是川菜里的开水白菜、麻婆豆腐；鲁菜里的葱烧海参、九转大肠；粤菜里的白切鸡、豉汁排骨；淮扬菜里的狮子头、大煮干丝。它们的共同点是，以蒸、煮作为最上档次、最政治正确的烹饪方式，炒次之，煎、炸再次之。而烧烤，则在被默认为是不上台面、不能用于高级食材的烹饪方式——中餐烹饪鄙视链的底端。



与这种观念截然相反的是，在几乎所有的中国城市、乡村中，烧烤是人人青睐、家家热爱的好物。无论宵夜小酒、露营户外、好友聚会或者阖家团圆，只要一炉烧烤镇场，那就有了氛围和排面。
不能处庙堂之高，则居江湖之远；不能赏炊金馔玉，则谋锦绣膏粱。烧烤，代表了中国饮食最草莽、最市井、最家常和最温情的那一面，也凝聚了中国人所有的因地制宜、圆融变通、行侠好义和林下风致。

烧烤的历史，远远早于其他烹饪方式。炖煮需要防水耐火的容器、蒸需要容器里加装隔水装置、煎炸需要食用油的榨取技术，但烧烤却什么都不用：几根树枝，一堆火，就能让腥膻的生肉，变成油花四溢，香气扑鼻的烤肉。也许在没有文字的时代，烧烤已经成为人们告别茹毛饮血的捷径。

但严格说来，“烧”和“烤”两个汉字，含义并不相同。《说文解字》对“烧”的释义是一个更复杂的字“爇”。从字形理解，就是捂在草堆下加热。



今天，在云南滇西地区还存在着一种古老的美食“火烧肉”，当地人有时又称之为“大烧”。制作很简单，把整猪肉埋入柴草堆里，点燃，慢慢等待火焰燃烧、熄灭。然后洗掉猪皮表面烧焦的地方，剩下半生不熟的猪肉切薄片后凉拌吃。



不能吃生的外地人，可以只要较熟的外层，而本地人则更倾向于连生带熟一起吃。不是这个，不够鲜嫩滑爽。无疑，这是古老的“烧”保存至今的饮食活化石，也是汉语、…]]></summary>

that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub

Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of
maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind
of maintainance their servers require, and
they convinced me that it might not be that bad.
So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see
what it was like.
Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did
anyway because there are a surprising number of decisions and I like to see
what choices other people make.

在完成考试离开象牙塔之后，接下来面临的就是选报学校和专业的问题。和十几年前相比，现在报选学校的流程已经人性化了许多，至少可以把确认学校的时间放在分数公布之后，省去了估算分数的麻烦，也避免了很多高分低走和被迫滑档甚至复读的痛苦。
但这样的设计只能解决「选上学校」的问题，相比之下，要在高考结束之后选择自己未来几年走向的专业科系才是更大的麻烦。目前，大部分学校的转专业体系仍然不太完善，无论是采用高考分数筛选、额外设置考试还是其他特殊规则，转专业制度仍然不能满足所有人的需求。
而且，由于对自身追求探索和实际生活阅历的双重不足，有不少人在实际深入大二甚至更晚的专业课程后才能发现，那个在家人、老师等等「参谋」之下选定的「好专业」根本不适合自己。错过本科的转专业考试之后，无论跨专业考研还是选择与自身专业相去甚远的工作，需要面对的精神压力和沉没成本都成倍增加，不少人在这样的衡量中逡巡不前，无法抉择。
作为曾经跨专业考研成功的人，我觉得或许有必要讲讲改换专业的故事。我找到了一些朋友，他们有的本科参加了转专业考试，有的选择了跨专业考研，有的在毕业后选择了与专业不同的工作。希望这些故事和经历，可以在你想做出这样的重大决策时，或多或少地提供一些帮助。
应受访者要求，以下八位参与者姓名均以代码代替。

你为什么要转/跨专业？
离开原有专业是一个需要勇气的决定。探索未知的体验十分新奇，但未知本身正是恐惧的来源。因此，转专业的动机尤为重要，需要一个坚定的想法作为引导，才能维持你在这条未知的道路上持续前进。
参与采访的八位朋友基本分为两类。一种是对专业的兴趣随着自我探索的进程迁移，或是发现自己选择的专业实际体验与预期不符，…]]></summary>

Sadece kendisi üzerinden localhost(127.0.0.1) üzerinden 5432 portundan haberleşebilmektedir. Bunu tüm ağlar üzerinden veya spesifik ağlar üzerinden erişilecek şekilde açabilirsiniz. 
Uzaktan bağlantıya izin verilmesi için, /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf dosyası içinde aşağıdaki satır düzenlenmesi gerekiyor: (normalde başında diyez var içinde de localhost yazıyor)
listen_addresses = '*'

Uzaktan bağlantı sağlayacak IP adresi veya IP adreslerinin bulunduğu ağ için /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf dosyasının en alt satırlarında bir yere aşağıdaki satır eklenmeli.
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

Bu satır eklendiğinde tüm ağlardan erişim sağlanabileceği gibi, güvenlik olarak sadece istenilen IP adresi veya ağ adresi yazılması daha uygun olacaktır.
Tüm işlemler sonucunda postgresql servisini yeniden başlatmak yetecektir.
sudo systemctl restart postgresql

Bu adımla birlikte uzaktaki herhangi bir SQL istemcisinden PostgreSQL sunucusuna sorgu atılabilmektedir.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Been a minute, but I'm back with another CSS tutorial!
This one will be pretty quick, but should give you a great launch point for extrapolating and creating something special.
Now you probably know that you can add borders to specific sides of an element, using, for instance:
.border-top {
    border-top: 1px solid white;
}

Result:

But what you may not realize, is what happens when you add a very simple additional property: border-radius! Now, maybe this sounds super obvious, but just how cool it is, isn't obvious until you see it in action, so let's do that:
.border-top-round {
    border-radius: 50%;
    border-top: 1px solid white;
}

Result:

Cool, isn't it? No?
Well let's make it so!
If the first bit wasn't all that impressive, maybe adding a little fun and flare should do the trick.
Check it out!




So what's the code for this one? Grab it here (it's free!):

Luckily, multiple tools can help us achieve a relatively good security posture. Snyk, CodeQL and GitGuardian are good examples.

手机虚拟机是什么？
手机虚拟机，用过电脑虚拟机的听到应该也不会陌生，其实就是内置在手机本体内的又一个系统。它虽然是模拟真机环境，但与本机系统最大的区别在于：你拥有对该系统的自主掌控权，也就是常说的「自带 root」或者「免 root」，多用于软件测试（包括安装非官方渠道应用）和应用多开。

提到这里，不免要区分下云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机。
云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机的区别
云手机：运行在 ARM 架构（适用于移动通讯领域）的服务器上，性能由服务器决定，用户需要通过远程访问云手机操控，不影响本机系统，但也存在网络延迟现象。
Android 模拟器：其实与手机虚拟机类似。Android 模拟器运行在电脑端，需要通过键盘鼠标来操控。对于习惯手游的用户来说，除特殊需求，使用频率并不算高。
手机虚拟机：运行在手机内，占用手机内存和运算能力，因而手机性能的高地直接决定了虚拟机的运行流畅度，优势是共享真机网络。
三者各有优势，加上成本因素（包括金钱和操作）来考量的话，倾向使用手机虚拟机的人越来越多。毕竟对于生活玩家来说，一台手机上就能免费完成应用多开、软件测试的需求，何乐而不为。
常见的手机虚拟机有哪些，优缺点是什么？
真机性能越好，虚拟机运行才会越流畅，类比在手机里运行的游戏应用。这几年各大手机厂商都在疯狂给手机加配置，又正是洞察到了我们的需求。
市场上主流的三款虚拟机也都一一使用过一段时间（仅以酷安上的数据为参照）。

VMOS Pro、光速和 51 虚拟机，三者其实大同小异，最受欢迎的多开，悬浮窗，挂机等…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 有助于弥合数字鸿沟，延长硬件的使用寿命，使得它成为操作系统的一个环保选择。




与大流行病作斗争，造成了生产新电脑所需的微芯片的短缺。此外，一些较新的专有操作系统提高了它们的硬件标准（LCTT 译注：Windows 11，别扭头看别人）。这个难题为我们这些在日常生活中使用 Linux 的人创造了一个机会。

延长硬件的生命周期

长期以来，Linux 一直以延长老旧硬件的寿命而闻名。这种能力对那些每天使用电脑的人来说是个福音。

在过去的一年里，我已经帮助许多人使用 Linux 翻新和 改装旧电脑。基于 Linux 的电脑耗电更少，启动速度更快。Gnome 桌面很好，但许多旧电脑更适合 LXDE 或 XFCE 环境，它们运行需要较少的资源。

像 FreeGeek 和 Kramden Institute 这样的组织已经把弥合数字鸿沟作为他们的核心使命，并以此为目标。这些团体对旧电脑进行了再利用，使它们不被当成垃圾填埋，而是把它们送到需要它们的用户手中。没有 Linux，就没有这些项目。

DD-Wrt、OpenWrt 和 Tomato 都是 Linux 解决方案，使旧的网络硬件不被当成垃圾丢弃，并同时为用户的路由器提供更多的安全、隐私和性能。

借助 GalliumOS 和 Mrchromebox.tech，即使是 Chromebooks 在谷歌停止支持后也能获得新的生命。

新的机会

Linux 创造了一些本来不存在的机会。学生和业余爱好者都在没有投资的情况下开始了计算机科学的成功事业，这要归功于他们在旧电脑上学到的经验。这些系统运行企业级软件，如 LAMP 栈，它促进了向 “Web 2.0” 的过渡。它是最早的 Web 开源软件栈之一。今天，它为 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla 系统提供了动力。事实上，Linux 为超过 96% 的世界前 100 万台 Web 服务器提供动力。Linux 还管理着 嵌入式系统、电子阅读器、智能电视、智能手表 等等。Linux 是世界上远远 超过 70% 的智能手机的操作系统。甚至美国国家航空航天局（NASA）今年在火星上创造历史的 毅力号，也是由 Linux 驱动的。

为当今大多数应用提供动力的云计算，没有 Linux 就不可能存在。今天的大多数 Web 和智能手机应用都在基于 Linux 的 容器 中运行。即使在微芯片短缺和专有系统成本高昂的情况下，进入云服务行业的人也有机会学习开源的操作系统和软件。

未来

但最恰当的是，Linux 和开源为 联合国可持续发展目标 提供了动力。随着大流行的继续，Linux 仍然是一个重要的资源。

The day I learned the word “introvert”, I finally understood myself completely. I had spent my entire day reading, researching, and taking every test on introversion. Finally, I understood why I don't fit in with most of my friends, why I enjoy my own company most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with me. 
I grew up in a "culture of personality" where everything is designed to cater to extroverts. For example, we were always encouraged and rewarded for working together, speaking up, or asking questions in schools. Likewise, we were promoted and rewarded for marketing ourselves with outgoing personalities at workplaces. Sometimes, we had to pretend to be extroverts in order to fit into the system.

前言
突然发现自己已经几个月没有更博了，一方面是因为最近换了工作比较忙，另一方面也是因为感觉没什么好分享的（也可能是因为懒。
恰好最近做公司项目涉及到大量文本的国际化翻译问题，手动一个个添加肯定不现实，浪费时间又容易出错。本来部门内部已经有了相关的脚本，可以把项目中的string导出为excel文件，然后发给专业翻译进行翻译，之后再导入到项目中；但是我用了这个脚本后发现问题太多，而且已经无人维护了，不得不痛下杀手完全重写了一个新的，本文就分享出来，简单记录一下。
使用方法
仓库地址
clone项目到本地，修改module_string_script模块中Config类的配置
运行ExportStrings2ExcelScript.kt导出目标项目中的string内容，导出后如下图

把导出的excel第一列锁定起来防止修改，然后提供出去翻译
运行ImportFromExcelScript.kt把翻译完的excel内容导入到项目里面
实现过程和遇到的问题

PHP 是 Web 上广泛使用的一种编程语言，据估计有近 80% 的网站使用它。我在 CrowdSec 的团队决定，我们需要为服务器管理员提供一个 PHP 门卫，以帮助抵御那些可能试图与 PHP 文件互动的机器人和不良分子。

CrowdSec 门卫可以在应用栈的各个层面上进行设置：Web 服务器、防火墙、CDN 等等。本文关注的是另外一个层次：直接在应用层面设置补救措施。

由于各种原因，直接在应用程序中进行补救是有帮助的：


它为潜在的安全威胁提供了业务逻辑上的答案。

它提供了关于如何应对安全问题的自由。


虽然 CrowdSec 已经发布了一个 WordPress 门卫，但这个 PHP 库被设计成可以包含在任何 PHP 应用中（例如 Drupal）。该门卫有助于阻止攻击者，用验证码挑战他们，让人类通过，同时阻止机器人。

先决条件

本教程假定你在 Linux 服务器上运行 Drupal，并使用 Apache 作为 Web 服务器。

第一步是在你的服务器上 安装 CrowdSec。你可以用 官方安装脚本 来完成。如果你使用的是 Fedora、CentOS 或类似系统，请下载 RPM 版本：

$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.rpm.sh


在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上，下载 DEB 版本：

Today we are diving into a particularly interesting program. We will be discussing link preview.
For long ago I've been noticing on some social media and apps a small preview of what awaits us in case we click or decide to follow the link, and others not having anything to preview. This has caused a set of variations on the different aspects of this link preview. Without turning around the boring story, let's go through our program.
Whenever on social media you add a URL, or when you receive an email message with a URL in the body, you'll see a rich preview that includes a link title, thumbnail image, domain, and description of the link. This is called a link preview. 
Below is a clear example of such.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[写在前面
大家好，我是喜欢 「用产品思维解构生活」 的花生酱，也可以叫我 Jeff。
我至今正式写作了6年，看上去是蛮不错的坚持成果，但老实说，最近1年我才开始喜欢自己的文章，也是在最近1年，我才找到自己“高效产出文章”的效率写作之道。
效率写作是个复杂的旅途，途中险象环生。
缺乏灵感和选题会让我们放弃，自说自话会让我们找不到读者，拾人牙慧会让我们迷失自我。这些复杂的难题，每一个都足够成为效率杀手，吞没我们的写作生涯。我也是花了5年时间，才逐一和解，摸索到我今日能安于写作的状态。
所以，我试图用这篇文章探讨：谈及写作，我们如何从入门、坚持再到高效。
希望诸君无需5年弯路，都能找到自己的效率写作之道。
 
粗放写作的利与弊
20221月我的少数派数据
2016年的我，从未想过自己能有幸发表文章被几万人阅读。
彼时，我带着不屑与傲慢开始写作，尝试去解答一些诸如“产品经理能力模型”的宏大命题。结果是，我被社区拒稿了4次，进而，巨大的恐慌和质疑包围着我。当时被拒绝的原因诸如：1.文章结构不符合金字塔思维；2.内容不够深度...
但我都不能完全地理解、修正，甚至自己完全看不出问题。
这种不理解，进一步引发了自我怀疑。
每天我都在想，我是不是不适合写作，我写的东西是不是太啰嗦了，或许我当前的能力不足以写产品话题，我该沉淀两年再等等？但对于这些问题，我并没有能力第一时间找到答案---否则就不会被拒绝4次了。
总之，我带着诸多疑问和拙劣的技巧，在自尊心的驱使和责任编辑的指引下，开始不断修改。第5次能够成功，其实并不是改得多好，而是靠坚持不懈。被拒绝带来的挫败和质疑激发了我的斗志，完全出于“洗脱被拒绝现状”的自尊心，让我坚持改稿。或许是不小心改到了要求的水准，或许是这种坚持一定程度上感动了编辑，历时2个月，终于发布。
就这样，这种“出于自尊心”的坚持，在头两年成为了我写作的源动力，甚至是唯一…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever used conditionals in your code you've seen if statements, and if you've seen if statements you've seen them nested several layers deep. In your personal project this could be simply annoying and cause problems down the road but in production code this can be really problematic. 
    The ternary operator, ?:, is one Question Mark operator and a feature in some programming languages that makes conditional statemnts cleanier and easier to read. The basic syntax goes like this:
condition ? if true : else;

In use this would look like this:
const foo = true ? 1 : 0;

In this snippet, foo is 1, since the condition is true, and true is (obviously) a truthy value.
If you're not sure what truthy/falsy values are just think of it this way:
0, false, undefined, NaN, empty strings, arra…]]></summary>

美联储发布报告讨论数字货币利弊

1 月 20 日，美国联邦储备委员会发布了关于数字货币的研究报告。这份题为《货币与支付：数字转型时代的美元》（Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation）的报告原定于去年夏天发布，目的在于征求公众意见，为美联储决定是否发行央行数字货币提供参考。
报告指出，数字美元（CBDC）可以从根本上改变美国金融体系的结构，改变私营部门和中央银行的角色和责任，具有确保美元在国际金融体系中继续维持领先地位、改善跨境支付、增加金融包容性并简化美元在新技术中的使用等好处。同时，报告也对可能产生的负面影响发出了警告，包括夺走传统银行业的存款，挤兑金融公司、隐私保护和打击非法融资等问题亟需考虑等。
但是，这份报告没有提出政策建议，也没有就是否支持推出数字美元发出明确信号。美联储强调，在没有白宫和国会明确支持的情况下，它不会采取进一步行动。目前，美联储官员内部对于数字美元的立场存在分歧。
此外，1 月 21 日，俄罗斯央行也发布了一份关于加密货币的报告，加密货币可能破坏国民经济，增加监管机构维持货币政策的难度；因此，建议政府立法禁止加密货币相关活动。来源

There are a wealth of resources online such as this claiming that in JavaScript primitive values are allocated on the stack while objects are allocated on the heap. This idea is false, at least this is not how the language is implemented in the majority of JavaScript engines I have seen. I am typing in this post so that I can link to it and save myself some time in the future.
All JavaScript values are allocated on the heap accessed by pointers no matter if they are objects, arrays, strings or numbers (except for small integers i.e. smi due to pointer tagging).

效果图
大家不要误会，效果图不是上面的图。。。上面的图太复杂了，我画的老虎可没有这么好看😂。。





哈哈哈，是不太好看哈。。不要在意那些细节，这不重要！重要的是迎接 2022 年虎年的那颗炙热且纯真的心，还加了点动画，当点击老虎的头的时候会动。。。

在这里先祝大家在虎年虎虎生威，每天都能虎虎大睡！
思路
本来想画一个好看的老虎，但真的动手的时候就有点不知所措了，本来想的一层一层放图片，就有点 PS 那意思了，那样效果确实比这个好，但是诚意和这个一笔一笔画的就不一样了。
后来决定通过 Path 来进行绘制，因为 Compose 中的 Path 在之前的项目中使用的较少，那就来吧，跟着我一步一步来画这个丑老虎吧。
开始撸码
画脑袋
先来画老虎脑袋吧，说好听点叫老虎脑袋，说不好听点那就是个圆。。。
val size = this.size
val path = Path()
path.moveTo(size.width / 2, bigSize)
val start = size.width / 6
​
// 画圆
path.addOval(Rect(start, 300f, start * 5, 300 + start * 5 - start))
path.close()
​
drawPath(path = path, color = Color.Yellow,
         style = Stroke(width = 10f))

Path 直接通过 addOval 就可以画一个圆，然后计算出圆的位置就行，下面来看下效果吧：

画头上的王字
脑袋画完了，接下来画一下老虎头上的王字，这是老虎的标志啊！
// 写头上的王字
path.addRect(Rect(start * 3 - 40f, 300f + 60f, …]]></summary>

“ PK创意闹新春，我正在参加「春节创意投稿大赛」，详情请看：春节创意投稿大赛”
话不多说直接上图

从图中可知，分为上下两部分，上部分是传统春联和福字，代表对大家的新年祝福，下部分是主要功能模块，包含红包金额、新年幸运签和是与不是。
采用Kotlin语言进行编写，涉及到的技术有：ConstraintLayout、Drawable、
自定义View、Android动画、Viewpager2、字体的设置和传感器的使用。
创意来源
这个创意的来源，主要是年纪大了，过年肯定要给侄子侄女发红包，哈哈哈，这回金额可以他们自己摇出来，具有互动和随机性比较好玩，为新年增添一份乐趣！
新年幸运签是给大家的祝福！
大家肯定会有很多场景，会产生选择困难，所以是与不是这个模块就是解决此类问题添加的！
新年也要动起来呀，刚好传统的摇签可以用手机摇一摇来模拟效果，活动手腕一举两得（真是个好点子啊）！
安卓手机的小伙伴可以下载安装包 体验一把，我是停不下来！
正文开始啦
首先这个布局看起来挺简单的对吧，LinearLayout设置方向vertical，中间在用一个LinearLayout设置方向horizontal。

但是这就产生了一个问题，布局嵌套，所以这也是我为什么采用ConstraintLayout来实现的原因，如下图，只用了一层。

ConstraintLayout使用
啰嗦两句，有的小伙伴可以没用过，可以参考下

在ConstraintLayout中的控件横竖两个方向都至少要选择一个进行约束，否则控件将在左上角进行摆放。
top指顶部bottom指底部start指左边end指右边，上例子



这是横批的文字，可以看到，它的顶部和父布局的顶部相约束，左边和父布局的左边相约束，右边和父布局的右边相约束。

横向居中需要左右都加约束，不需要的话，想让控…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为设计师，我特别喜欢一位美食编辑说过的一段话：Food is becoming an art form more than ever before and presentation is almost as important as taste: we eat with our eyes first, don’t we?食物越来越成为了一门艺术，食物的呈现方式和味道一样重要。没有发现我们是用眼睛先来“品尝“食物的吗？
西餐中有个专业词汇就叫做”Food Presentation[1]”, 直译就是“食物的汇报“（意译是食物的呈现方式），这个直译是不是特别的形象？就像是我们一个项目结束，精心准备了一个从排版到内容无比精良又吸引人的的PPT，去给客户做汇报；美好的食物原材料也在厨师的精心烹饪下最后以一个漂亮又吸引人的方式呈现给了食客。

西餐（这里指的是贵西餐）因为分餐制，还有烹饪方式更多的是煎炸炖烤，最后一步“组合食材摆盘”，给我们的印象就是非常注重「摆盘的艺术」（The design in plating）,我自己在做菜和海外生活的这么多年中，也是特别喜欢学习和积累这样的食物呈现方式，毕竟好看赏心悦目的菜品谁不喜欢呢？

年夜饭或者纪念日等非常有意义的庆祝时刻，如果想露一手，非常推荐借鉴一些西式烹饪和摆盘的技巧，知道原理和方法后简单容易上手。相比起咱们中餐中造型独特美丽的菜品，比如「松鼠桂鱼」「文思豆腐」对于刀工还有火候厨艺技能的高要求，西式摆盘还是门槛低的多的多，也更容易复刻到家常餐桌上。
受 @知乎美食邀约，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，感谢小伙伴@刘小白小美女的许愿：0厨艺怎样快速做出艳压全场的创意菜。日常和朋友们交流，大家印象中西餐很多食材不好买/食材很贵等顾虑，那小妖今天就通过一些中式常见的食材，加入西餐摆盘艺术，用最简单的烹饪方式，来和大家探讨下：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[感谢@知乎美食 邀（cuī）请（cù），让我在忙到起飞的年底完成了自己很早就想做的一件事，就是复制经典传统川菜给大家吃（kàn）。从下面的留言情况来看，点川菜的不多呀，但是有一个聪明可爱的朋友提到了一个东西，很多四川本地人可能也没吃过，那就是蛋圆子。我决定就Pick它了！

在介绍蛋圆子之前，我先要介绍两款有点雷同的食物。一个是武汉黄陂三鲜里的肉糕，那是用鱼肉和猪肉按1:5的比例绞成泥做的，口感弹牙，鱼肉增加了明显的鲜甜。

二是在四川川北地区，尤其是绵阳梓潼县为盛的镶碗，那是用精肉和豆腐剁成茸，加鸡蛋、芡粉后上蒸笼，再依次添加一层蛋黄、一层蛋白。出来是这样的：

而蛋圆子呢，是四川川南地区宜宾一带的代表性食物，在宴席上担任“头碗”，其重要性不言而喻。名叫圆子，其实并不是圆的，而是圆柱体。肉不是打成泥或茸，而且切成筷子或小指头粗细，和鸡蛋、红薯粉、盐、白胡椒、姜末、鸡精等和匀，装裹进蛋皮里，上蒸笼蒸熟。 

以上三道菜，看起来有点像，我相信以中国之大，其他地区还有类似的，欢迎知友们补充。不管是肉糕、镶碗、蛋圆子，不管肉和鸡蛋是什么形式的组合，都是先蒸熟，再搭配其他食材复蒸。黄陂三鲜是鱼圆、肉圆、肉糕，吃的时候蒸十分钟，在用高汤煨着，配木耳、平菇、白菜等，也可以煮火锅、配面条。镶碗则重在吃汤，切好片的肉辅以猪心舌脏片和肥肠、酥肉、响皮、炸豆腐皮、木耳、黄花、粉条、白菜，浇上高汤，蒸锅一开形如宝盖莲花、色泽亮丽，口味清淡馥郁。蛋圆子切片以后，下面垫上蒸熟的荔浦芋头（当地人叫黑秆秆芋）、黄花、木耳、拆骨肉，上面在盖上蛋圆子片，和一块猪油、少许葱末，复蒸10分钟即可。
镶碗和蛋圆子可能都会颠覆外地人对川菜的认知，因为它们跟辣椒一点也不沾边。作为宴席菜，它们都需要制作者在前期准备大量工作，临上桌前复蒸很快，这样可以大大缩短上菜时间，提高出菜效率。
既然是老菜新做，我想从两个方面对宜宾…]]></summary>

NO NO NO! 
是时候放烤箱、电饭煲和空气炸锅这现代厨房三大宝出来一战了！

受 @知乎美食 邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，豆蔻我一眼瞅到知友@DDDDDDD 说想学做烤鸡，嘿哟你可问对人了！
本吃鸡狂魔今天给大家带来了【黄油鸡腿卷】、【彩虹时蔬烤鸡胸】、【盐焗鸡】这3道！聚餐贼有面子的美貌菜！最多不超过3步，就能完成，绝对厨房小白友好~

第一道：奶油鸡腿卷
香香嫩嫩的烤鸡腿好吃是好吃，但是当个正儿八经的菜上桌总是有点过于豪横，所以这次咱换个方式，烤个鸡腿卷！
有菜有肉，吃的时候还不用沾一手油~


食材： 手枪腿 香菇 胡萝卜
调料：盐、黑胡椒、芝士粉、黄油
1、手枪腿去骨，在肉上打上花刀，撒上一层盐和奶酪粉，放上切片的香菇、胡萝卜、小块的黄油

2、然后把鸡腿对折用牙签稍微固定一下

3、再拿根绳子捆紧，表面撒上一层薄薄的盐（盐它可以帮助鸡皮快速脱水，烤出来更加金黄酥脆），送进预热好的空气炸锅，160度烤40分钟（或烤箱180度50分钟）就好了！

成品是这样的！点开大图瞅瞅，看到上面鼓起的小泡泡了咩？这是鸡皮酥脆的好像薯片一样的证据，拿筷子敲敲还咔咔直响！
你要是想吃那可得手脚麻利些，出炉就立刻马上解开绳子，把它扒下来，超过10分钟鸡皮就会回软啦～

但回软不代表味道会变差，切成厚片装盘，蘸着盘底的鸡汁，味道会更好！
看，香菇和胡萝卜被嫩嫩的鸡肉紧紧地裹着，给浓郁的肉香里加入了蔬菜的清甜。鸡肉卷里面汁水特别充盈，只是轻轻捏着就淌的我满手的汤！

黄油和奶酪粉的香气渗入在鸡肉和蔬菜里，我切的时候那个浓郁抹奶香味从里到外的扩散开来，你们不知道我费多大劲才忍住不吃（≧∇≦）

什么？对奶味接受无能？别走别走！还可以试试下面这一道彩虹时蔬烤鸡胸呀～
这道菜是餐桌上大家接受度最高的清新派，蔬菜多，微酸甜！我敢打赌，就算是过年也在减肥的都市丽人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[发现植入到 UEFI 固件中的恶意程序

研究人员通过固件扫描器的日志发现了一个 植入 到 UEFI 固件中的恶意程序 MoonBounce。该扫描器自 2019 年初以来已被整合到卡巴斯基产品中。恶意程序修改了主板上的 SPI 闪存，它不在硬盘上，因此格式化硬盘或更换硬盘不会清除恶意程序。修改后的固件镜像允许攻击者拦截引导序列的执行流，引入一个复杂的感染链。由于感染链只在内存中运行，而在硬盘上没有留下攻击痕迹。该恶意程序可以部署用户模式的恶意软件，从互联网上下载并执行的更多的有效载荷。


老王点评：真是无孔不入，这些恶意程序真是能别开生面的发现利用方法。




FSF 让其 5000 多名准会员提名董事会成员

自由软件基金会（FSF）董事会前几天通过了 新程序，在其 37 年的历史上，第一次可以让其准会员提名其董事会成员。FSF 打算在 2022 年利用这些新程序首先增加几个新董事，然后开始对现有董事进行审查。包括所有现任董事在内的有投票权的成员可以参与投票。FSF 主席说：“向我们的准会员开放董事招聘程序是 FSF 的一个历史性的、受欢迎的里程碑。”该流程是由顾问主导的六个月审查的主要成果。


老王点评：作为开源先锋，FSF 能践行社区治理是一个进步。




Linux 大量向用户提供了固件更新

本周早些时候，在上传了许多新的系统固件文件后，Linux 供应商固件服务提供了大量下载服务。这些固件解决的问题尚未披露，似乎是一个“高度严重的即将到来的安全问题”，但据分析是在更新英特尔 CPU 的微代码。经过 测试发现，无论新的安全问题是什么，它似乎都没有任何广泛的性能影响。


老王点评：在这种时候，就感觉到了 Linux 供应商固件服务的重要性。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是 10 篇最受欢迎的 Linux 文章。




2021 年，我们发表了远超 150 篇的 Linux 方面的文章。从桌面 Linux 用户小工具的文章到将 Linux 作为服务器操作系统的教程，以及介乎于两者之间的各种场景，这些文章已经涵盖了 Linux 生态系统的许多方面。所有这些文章都值得你花时间去阅读，但你可以从今年发表的这十篇好文章开始阅读。

3 个开源工具，使 Linux 成为理想的工作站

在这篇文章中，Seth Kenlon 介绍了 LibreOffice、AbiWord、Gnumeric 和 Pandoc，涵盖了 使 Linux 成为理想工作站的工具。他解释了在使用 Linux 作为桌面操作系统时，这些应用程序如何使你的工作效率提高。文章探讨了一些高级功能，如 LibreOffice 的无头模式，并提供了如何充分利用每个应用程序的小技巧。

为什么我在 Linux 上使用 exa 而不是 ls

ls 命令是 Linux 中最常用的终端命令之一，但你知道它有一个现代的替代品，提供了许多有益的改进吗？Sudeshna Sur 的 文章 介绍了 exa 命令以及它相比 ls 的优势，讨论了 exa 如何跟踪添加到 Git 仓库的新文件、显示目录和文件树等等。

我喜欢在 Linux 上编码的 5 个原因

像许多人一样，Seth Kenlon 喜欢在 Linux 上编码。在这篇文章中，他分享了这样做的 五个原因。他喜欢在 Linux 上编码，因为它建立在逻辑的基础上，可以让你欣赏代码之间的关联，提供了源代码，并提供直接访问外设和抽象层的能力，使编写代码更容易。

这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第1天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战
有一天，
我正听着歌，开心的敲着代码，这时候小王同志急冲冲的跑过来拍了拍我的肩膀，
“付老板，我这遇到一个问题，连续两次请求同一个接口，参数传的不同，但是livedata的onChange回调只走了一次，UI界面上只有一个地方更新成功了，这是咋回事啊？”
一听有bug，这我可就来劲了，立马摘下耳机，
“来，上代码”，
“诶~ 你这是在UI层注册了一个监听，然后在请求接口的地方，利用livedata连续postValue两次。看情况你这应该是postValue搞的鬼，不急，我来模拟下场景，看看他的内部实现”。
新建一个ViewModel，创建一个String类型值的MutableLiveData，向外抛出一个更新String值的方法，并且使用liveData的postValue来通知UI更新数据。

Now, however, as I'm pushing 70, my needs have changed. A few years ago, I purchased a brand new Darter Pro from System76, and its default resolution is 1920x1080, and it's high DPI, too. The system came with Pop_OS!, which I found that I had to modify to be able to see the icons and text on the display. Thank goodness that Linux on the desktop has become much more accessible than in the 1990s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上海又撞上疫情，连续三年春节不能回家，对父母始终有些亏欠。
昨天(春节前10天)，收到微信的提示，提示使用定制红包封面。
突然发觉这是个好主意。不能回家，那帮父母做个红包封面。自己似乎也随着红包，跟父母一起给亲戚拜年。

红包封面的设计并不复杂，小白也能轻松设计。不过前提是，要有个100粉丝的视频号或公众号。
接下来介绍下，微信红包定制的整体流程。
红包封面额度
微信发了2000个红包封面，足够我帮家里每个人定制红包的。
值得注意的是，封面会在2022年2月1日23:59过期，只能在大年初二前使用。
微信红包团队的生意算盘太响了。这活动，不但给红包封面带来大量新用户，后期也能让不少人续费红包时间。

没用获取红包封面额度也没关系，可以自行购买。封面费用是1元/个，有效期半年。
封面平台注册
领取定制红包额度后，提示登录到微信红包封面开放平台。
首次使用封面平台，需要注册并认证。如果你是用个人身份认证，注册中无付费环节。

个人认证，需要100粉丝的视频号或公众号。

注意，绑定的个人微信号需要实名认证。
红包封面设计
注册成功后，即可定制红包封面。
微信提供了 psd 和 sketch 的红包封面模板，流程参考微信红包封面官方文档。
不懂设计模板能不能用？
可以的。
零基础用小画家，有图层概念则用 Figma。
不管工具如何，你上传图片，即可完成红包设计。
示例基础图片 (推荐手写字体：杨任东竹石体)
封面注意事项

红包封面会展示公众号名称和头像。名称一年可修改两次，头像一个月可申请修改5次。因为红包是给家人用的，不方便展示公众号信息。我选了个不用的公众号，把名称和头像都修改了。
红包审核需要3个工作日，距离春节也已经很近了。如果你想在春节使用定制红包，尽快申请审核三个红包封面，避免最后关头未通过。
如果微信红包封面中出现肖像，需要授权。拜年红包还是希望有全家福，我提交了资料，但通过几率不大。

完成后的红包：

互联网就像汽车，可以带我们到不借助工具到不了的地方。但与汽车不同的是，我们只在需要出门的时候用汽车，却时时刻刻都在上网。
我个人认为互联网斋戒完全不需要理由，因为它对我茶毒太深。我时刻想逃离但逃不掉，如果能戒掉互联网我确定自己会活的更快乐。每次周末看到手机推送的屏幕使用时间，都会心里一惊。但始终无法下定决心戒手机，一是怕别人找我有急事，二是不上网我不知道还能干啥。

花几天时间，用最俭省的费用生活，穿最朴素的衣服，然后问自己：“这是我所害怕的生活吗？” ——塞内加

我不害怕朴素的生活，但“无聊”的生活却让我害怕，“网络似乎剥夺了我专注和沉思的能力。”记者尼古拉斯·卡尔2008年在《大西洋月刊》上发表的一篇文章中坦言，“而且不只有我是这样” 。网络不仅让我们 “无法思考”，而且让我们无法忍受“无聊”。
每时每刻都被互联网刺激着，偶尔停下来我会发现自己其实非常疲惫。
上网太快乐了，有游戏的快乐、学习的快乐、还有与人交流的快乐，只要有网络我就不愁没事干。但这种把我填满的快乐，会让我在某些时候觉得可怕，有种看完《黑镜》之后的窒息感。如果一切都通过电子屏来感受，那什么是真实的呢？
为了找到“真实”，我进行了如下的“实验”：
一、个人实验
1. 中秋三天断网实验
中秋节三天假期是我的互联网安息日，这三天大家只能通过电话和短信与我联系。

为了平安的度过这三天，我提前做了一些保障措施：

买够三天要吃的食材，因为没网点不了外卖。
给自己安排好各种活动，第一天去烫了个头发、第二天去电影院看了个电影（断网前买好了电影票），第三天啥都没干。
准备好本子、实体书、钩织图解，填满自己的时间。（互联网的荼毒，为什么我不能让自己什么都不干？）

升级
各位大佬，提早祝大家新年快乐。
年初了，我们打算升级下apg，这样之后就拥抱下jetpack compose了！！
想用comopse有两个必选项agp7.0和kotlin版本1.5.31.
Java11配置
因为apg7.0需要把所有的module编译环境切换到java11版本上，然而这个地方很容易出错。
首先是命令行的配置，对于mac用户来说，可能会写死默认的java环境到1.8. 这个时候我们需要做的就是删除bashprofile内的java配置。
同时最好用命令行java --version尝试下输出的版本是不是java11。

as的配置则相对来说比较简单了。


按照这两个配置完成之后重新同步下工程应该就行了。
AndroidComponentsExtension
之前在现在准备好告别Transform了吗？的文章就简单展开了下AndroidComponentsExtension，新版本更换了extensions。这次给项目升级适配之前写的哪些插件，想了想用新不用久吗，尝试下新东西了。
onVariants
以前在写android插件的时候很多时候都需要在gralde的afterEvaluate方法执行之后才能获取到很多安卓对应的属性。
这次在v2的api中，则提供了非常多不同的节点，让我们在不同的阶段做一些不同的事情。
比如说onVariants,beforeVariants,finalizeDsl这三个不同的阶段，正常情况下我们选择onVariants就足够了。
Component Artifacts
demo 地址
Gralde 内的一部分核心是Task，但是要想写好一个Task其实并没有想象中的那么容易。特别是一个CacheableTask,他更多的关注与他们的输入和输出。

引言
作为一个普通人，在使用 iPhone 的将近 14 年时间里，Due 陪伴我走过了 6 年多的时间。并且在这 6 年多的时间里，看着很多人从 OminiFocus 用到 Things，而它牢牢霸占了我首屏上的一个固定位置，就像已经「刻」在那里了一样。

梦回 2014 年的年初，正在公车通勤路上的我，在播客上听到了《狗熊有话说》的主播，@i大狗熊 的一期关于 GTD 理论的介绍，大概意思是，关于 OmniFocus 这款时间管理应用程序的使用心得，将任务根据紧急、重要程度，分到四个象限进行归类，方便在日后进行任务管理时快速拾取，规划并掌控自己的时间，高效工作、生活。

听了这期播客之后，我便开始规划起了自己的时间管理之路，憧憬着自己掌控时间、掌控命运、升职加薪的美好未来。于是我打开 App Store，搜索关键字 OmniFocus，新鲜感带着肾上腺素刺激着我的交感神经，哪怕现在用自己的流量下载，我也要立刻得到它！

Hi，很高兴见到你！👋🏻
本文主要分享 Android 无障碍功能 的一些优化经验，希望看完本篇，可以帮助到你，以及哪些特殊的用户群体。
前言
最近我们团队收到了一些用户的反馈：

有用户反馈，我们的部分功能按钮在无障碍下无法正常识别。其实这已经不是我第一次看到反馈了，第一次是16年ios端收到了用户的反馈，进行过一次优化。说来惭愧，反而是我们 Android 这边也一直没有专门适配。
什么是无障碍功能？
对于一些视障人群或者听障人群而言，普通的App对它们来说使用起来可能困难重重。在 Android 上，对于这些用户用户而言，主要通过系统附带的屏幕阅读器 TalkBack 来进行控制设备。
所以无障碍功能是应用开发中的重要组成部分，通过集成无障碍功能和服务，可以提高应用的易用性尤其是对于残障用户而言。
背景与现状
我国现在 1691万 视障人士，2780万 听障人士，2977万 肢体残障人士，数据来源于 2021年第7次 人口普查，中国互联网络信息中心官网。
在国内，专门去处理的并不太多，一是因为这件事情很多开发者并不知晓(我们下面会提到为什么)，再者相对而言的收益可能并不高及一般也没有用户反馈，这件事情就一直没有太被重视，对于 无障碍功能 ，可能更多是部分工具App中常见，比如某些抢红包等插件。
而 无障碍功能 的适配在国外却是相对比较常见的一个事，甚至于某些国家如果不做适配可能会无法上架；
纵观业内，腾讯系产品在这方面做的比较好，当然这与他们内部标准的开发规则及庞大的 用户群体 也有关系。
那为什么大多数开发者不知晓呢？
其实主要源于 Android原生UI 对于 无障碍 并不是 强制性 的，所以大多数国内开发者在初入 Android 时甚至都没法…]]></summary>

在软件行业中，各种类型的程序员写代码的职业已经变得很普遍，这些代码通过开源许可证发布到公共场所。业界的猎头们通常要求查看这些代码来审查未来员工候选人。那些将自己职业生涯专注在开源项目开发的人得到了回报。从 payscale.com 网站得知，Linux 系统管理员的收入比 Windows 管理员要高，这表明从事开源软件领域可以获得更高的报酬和更稳定的工作机会。分享你的工作会让你感觉良好（这甚至可能是一种因果报应），你知道自己正在为整个世界创造价值。历史上，这样的机会可从来没有为我们这些从事于开源硬件领域的人存在过。

二十多年前，几乎没有人知道开源硬件是什么，更别说围绕它规划自己的职业生涯了。举例而言，在 2000 年全世界发表了超过 200 万篇学术论文，却只有 7 篇文章提到过“开源硬件”。在我第一次写《开源实验室》 的时候，我收集了每一个案例（其实也就几十个），并且可以轻松的跟上和阅读每一篇发布的关于开源硬件的文章，还把它们发布到维基上。我很高兴的报告大家，这种情况现在已经实际上不可能了。今年已经有超过 1500 篇文章在讨论“开源硬件”，而且我相信年底的时候还会有更多的文章发表出来。开源硬件现在已经是一个独立的领域，有一些专门报导它的杂志（比如说 《HardwareX》 和 《Journal of Open Hardware》）。在更多的领域中，数十种传统杂志现在也会定期报道最新的开源硬件的发展。



开发智能开源硬件 3-D 打印 (Joshua Pearce, GNU-FDL)

即使是在十年前，从职业生涯的角度看，强调开源硬件开发在某种程度上也是一种冒险。我记得在我上一份工作的简历中，我淡化了和它相关的内容，更多的强调了我的传统工作。工业界和学术界的管理人员难以明白如果这些设计被送出去…]]></summary>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第2天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。
委托模式是实现继承的一个很好的替代方式，也是Kotlin语言的一种特性，可以很优雅的实现委托模式。在开发过程中也少不了使用它，但常常都会被低估。所以今天就让它得到重视，去充分的掌握kotlin委托特性以及原理。
一、委托类
我们先完成一个委托类，常常用于实现类的委托模式，它的关键是通过by关键字：
interface Base{
  fun print()
}

class BaseImpl(val x: Int): Base{
  override fun print() { print(x) }
}

class Derived(b: Base): Base by b

fun main(){
  val b = BaseImpl(10)
  Deriived(b).print()
}

//最后输出了10

在这个委托模式中Derived相当于是个包装，虽然也实现了base，但并不关心它怎么实现，通过by这个关键字，将接口的实现委托给了它的参数db。
相当于Java代码的结构：
class Derived implements Base{
  Base b;
  public Derived(Base b){ this.b = b}
}

二、 委托属性
前面讲到Kotlin委托类是委托的是接口方法，委托属性委托的，则是属性的getter和setter方法。kotlin支持的委托属性语法：
class Example {
    var prop: String by Delegate()
}

属性对应的get()和set()会被委托给它的getValue和setValue方法。当然属性的委托不…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第5天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。
通过前面的文章同一个app不同activity显示多任务（仿微信小程序切换效果)这篇文章可以知道：
如果需要实现activity在recent task中，必须给需要打开的activity设置如下代码
Intent intent = new Intent(myContext, ZDActivity.class);
intent.addFlag(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOUCMENT);
...
startActivity(intent);

当打开该activity之后，切换到recent task页面，则会显示两个task.
然后这边的需求是要在targetActivity中通过广播来开启另外一个activityB
此时启动的Activity必须添加intent.addFlag(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)才能开启，这是在广播中开启activity的必须条件，
这样就会出现问题：
假设启动ZDActivity的activity是ActivityA,广播启动的activity是ActivityB，问题就是通过广播启动ActivityB时，会跳转到ActivityA，然后再启动ActivityB，同时切换到recent task页面，会显示三个task，这里不信的伙伴可以手动试试就能看到效果。
要想解决这个问题就必须要了解activity的taskAffinity属性的使用

了解之后知道，只需要在应用的manifest.xml中设置ActivityB的taskAffinity属性即可，必须设置成跟包名不一样，因为默认就是包名，这样就已经解决了通过广播启动ActivityB时，会跳转到ActivityA，然后在启动ActivityB的问题。
当设置了taskAffinity属性之后，不会跳转到ActivityA了，但同样还是会显示三个task的问题，这里暂时还没有解决方案，请知道的小伙伴指点明路。
然后就回到上篇文章中说的没有使用finishAndRemoveTask()方法没问题的结论：错误
很明显，这里ActivityB的task需要关闭ActivityB的时候使用finishAndRemoveTask()方法才能关掉，但只能在5.0以上起作用，5.0以下添加intent.addFlag(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT)不起作用。
最后再说下在这个场景下使用分享的问题：
当通过广播启动ActivityB之后，ActivityB再启动分享到QQ，这里使用第三方SDK，如Mob等，你会发现分享到QQ之后，点击“回到你的应用”居然不会回到ActivityB，同样的是回到了ActivityA，也有可能是先回到ActivityA，然后再回到ActivityB，也就是说没有正确的回调到正确的页面，就这个问题也问过Mob的客服，那边说没有办法解决。
最后经过不断测试，需要在所有第三方配置的回调Activity中设置同样的taskAffinity属性即可。


以上内容纯粹个人测试总结，如有问题，请联系改正，谢谢！]]></summary>

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第6天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
前言
在阅读Kotlin的代码时，经常有看到 :: 这个符号，这个符号专业术语叫做成员引用，在代码中使用可以简化代码，那到底怎么使用呢以及使用的范围，这篇文章就来好好捋一下。
正文
这里虽然很熟悉，但是我们还是从简单说起，需要了解为什么这样设计。
传递函数优化
这里我们举个栗子，就看这个熟悉的sortBy排序函数，先定义People类：
//测试代码
data class People(val name: String,val age: Int){
    //自定义的排序条件
    fun getMax() : Int{
        return age * 10 + name.length
    }
}

然后我们来进行排序：
val people = People("zyh",10)
val people1 = People("zyh1",100)
val peopleList = arrayListOf(people,people1)
//给sortBy传入lambda
peopleList.sortBy { people -> people.getMax() }

这里我们给sortBy函数传递一个lambda，由于sortBy函数是内联的，所以传递给它的lambda会被内联，但是假如现在有个问题，就是这些lambda已经被定义成了函数变量，比如我定义了一个顶层函数：
//定义了一个顶层函数
fun getMaxSort(people: People): Int{
    return (people.age) * 10 + people.name.length
}

或者排序条件已经定义成了一个变量值：
//排序条件

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[依靠 1988 年的大型机的流程造成了 10 亿英镑的养老金黑洞

英国国家审计署的一份报告发现，ICL 时代遗留下来的大型机是 10 亿英镑的 国家养老金黑洞 的原因之一。英国劳工部所赖以管理数以百万计的养老金领取者记录的基础 IT 系统可以追溯到 1988 年，而且需要大量的手工操作。该部门现有的质量检查未能发现成千上万的养老金领取者的系统性欠费，这些老人因而领不到应得的养老金。这是由于依赖于“自动化程度有限”的系统的流程，并且需要“使用多个系统和解释复杂的规则”。工作人员对升级系统有抵触情绪，因为“从商业角度来看，这样做的过程是非常复杂和非常有风险的。”此外，工作人员还需要访问不同的 IT 系统，并手动将信息从一个系统复制到另一个系统，以计算养老金奖励。


老王点评：如何使 IT 系统也能不断更新换代，这是一个系统性的工程。




SUSE 瞄准后 CentOS 市场，发布 Liberty Linux

SUSE 突然在其网站上宣布了 Liberty Linux，加入了后 CentOS 市场争夺。该产品似乎是 SUSE 对 CentOS 8 的重建，旨在实现接近完美的 RHEL 8 兼容性。目前该发行版还没有可以公开下载的版本，不过除了内核，它的所有 RPM 都构建自红帽官方的源代码 RPM 包。它的内核来自 SUSE 自己的 SLE 企业发行版。有意思的是，SUSE 并没有将 Liberty Linux 描述为一个发行版，而是将其描述为“技术和支持产品”、“一个技术和支持解决方案”，以及“现有 Linux 的技术和支持模式，而不是另一个新的 Linux 发行版”。


老王点评：SUSE 眼馋 CentOS 市场这并不奇怪，但是却将其作为一个服务产品，颇显得扭扭捏捏。




恶意行为者利用供应链攻击在近百款 WordPress 主题和插件中植入后门

AccessPress 是一家 WordPress 插件开发商，其开放的插件和主题在超过 36 万个活跃网站中使用。恶意行为者通过供应链攻击破坏了它的 40 个主题和 53 个插件。这些后门 已经在相当多运行 WordPress 的网站上被发现。但在 WordPress 项目的官方网站上镜像的相同主题和插件仍然是干净的，而直接从 AccessPress 获得的软件的用户在不知情的情况下为攻击者提供了后门权限。这些主题和插件可能已经被植入后门已久。


老王点评：对于这样的供应链攻击，用户有什么办法吗？相信绝大多数的用户没有能力审查代码。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[题图：Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash
「卡片笔记写作法」用久了，你总会遇到一个问题，就是卡片太多。
这一方面是个效率问题。你要是想把卡片笔记当成严肃的工具，那么底层就得用数据库来组织信息，而非文件系统。Logseq 目前正在做这种迁移。在卡片少的时候，这二者的效率看不出差别，甚至文件组织方式因为直观显得更加友好。但是卡片到了 10 万级别的时候，效率的差别就会显现。效率不达标，随便查找个东西，你都能感受到「卡」。
以我个人的 Roam Research 数据统计为例。虽然「页面」（Page）只有 1 万多，但是别忘了 Roam Research 下的真正卡片单位，是按「块」（block）来计算。

Roam Research 里 Page 的真正含义是什么呢？我觉得是「盒子」，卡片盒嘛。虽不是物理意义上的盒子，有固定形态，但它确实是承载卡片的容器。在 Roam Research 中，如果你的链接都在页面层级，而不是块引用（block reference），那么你其实并没有发挥出它「细粒度」的特性。
效率问题，还只是一个方面。更要命的，是卡片数量庞大之后，你会忘记自己曾经记过某些东西。本文主要讨论的，便是这个恼人的事儿。
最近，「合桃派」团队邀请医学博士 Lan 分享自己的块引用实践。她结合 Cite to write 和 Roam Untangled 两门课程里的方法，利用块引用自底向上构造「问题」，然后用「问题」的块引用来组织论文。她的第一篇综述论文靠着双链笔记工具的加持，超出预期快速写就，且已被录用。 Lan 这种学以致用的精神，很值得钦佩。
讨论环节，我问了她一个问题 —— 若是很久前（一两年前）记录的卡片，内容忘记了怎么办？新的笔记若与之相关，怎么回忆、识别并且链接呢？
Lan 回答，她依靠头脑人工记忆完成链接。
这个回答，很实…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[终端是很多人日常打交道的工具之一。比如，深度学习是目前一个大热的研究课题，由于训练和推理过程需要强大的 GPU，研究生们共享 GPU 服务器，并通过终端使用 SSH 连接并编写代码。而公司中的运维人员，也需要通过 SSH 进行远程访问服务器，对系统或服务进行维护。
在日常操作中，最大的问题就是如何优雅地从远程主机中复制文本并粘贴到本机中。
问题：跨平台系统剪贴板不通
远程主机一般我们不能直接通过显示器和键盘控制，也没有图形界面，所有的操作都需要通过 SSH 访问并在终端操作。
而本机和远程主机都各自有自己的一套剪切板，在命令操作中复制的文本只会保存在远程主机的剪贴板中。那我们通过终端的图形界面选择并复制不可以吗？

上图是一个非常日常的场景，我们需要从一个配置文件里复制一行或是多行的代码，这里我们选择的工具是 VIM。但我们真的开始复制时就会遇到如下的困难：

困难一：如果只想要复制正文，那么左侧的代码行号也不得不被选择。尽管这个可以通过绑定快捷键快速开关行号。
困难二：细心观察，图中文本的第三行超过了终端的宽度，自动换行到下一行展示。如果同时选择这两行，粘贴出来的效果也会是两行而不是它本该的一行。
困难三：整份文档并不只有 24 行，如果想要复制整份文档，则不得不分几次逐次选择并复制全终端屏幕。

而这些情况也的确困扰了我很久。
解决方案：OSC codes
OSC 代表的是 Operating System Controls, 是一种约定俗成的用于终端程序中的逃逸序列表达，终端会根据 OSC codes 所定义的行文处理方式处理它所包围的文本。
而正巧的是就有一种定义决定了「如何从终端中复制内容到系统剪贴板中」，那就是 OSC 52 escape sequence。
OSC 52 一次最长接受 100000 个字节，其中前 7 个字节为 "\033]52;c;"，中间 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[突发奇想的想在少数派写这些东西，我也不知道是否会有人喜欢喜爱咖啡，但我一个咖啡从业者希望大家可以慢慢接受咖啡，并且把咖啡和茶放在同一个地位。说的比较大，主要还是想把好喝的咖啡带给大家认识。

今天这篇软文主要是想给大家了解下普通家庭如何入门咖啡～～
首先，你是否喝茶？额，可能有些人会疑惑，喝咖啡为何还会问是否喝茶。但其实茶和咖啡一样，都带有苦涩的成分，如果你能接受喝茶，那喝咖啡就不会有太大问题，两者都属于苦涩甘甜类型。
方便大家理解，这边制图告诉大家。


烘焙程度酸度-MAX5⭐醇度-MAX5⭐
浅度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
中度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
深度烘焙⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


就和上图标识的一样，烘焙程度取决了咖啡的酸和苦。通过表格其实就很好理解，如果你想喝咖啡，先选好你喜欢什么样的风格。酸？苦？甜？涩？新手入门的话不管是在售卖咖啡的地方还是在连锁咖啡店，都推荐从中度烘焙开始尝试，因为这个阶段有很多种不一样的风味，当你在这个烘焙程度喝习惯后，你可以尝试下浅度烘焙，这会让你感觉不像在喝咖啡，而是想在品一杯果汁。这深度烘焙的话，我建议上意式浓缩就是最好的选择，上面两种烘焙程度建议进行手冲来品尝。
说到冲煮方式，这里前两种烘焙都建议手冲进行，给大家介绍下咖啡的冲煮方式吧～～～
1、滴滤手冲
V60手冲
这是一个V60滤杯的手冲器具，嗯。。。可能大家都想问V60是什么，其实这个名字是按照滤杯的角度命名的，60度刚好是它的角度，V代表了这个形状。这款手冲器具相对来说比较适合新手，简单又可以自我调整也便宜。
————————————可以淘宝这款器具，推荐塑料款————————————
2、法压壶
法压壶
这是一个壶，法式压力壶。法压壶其实也很适合新手，之所以介绍它，是因为它的冲煮方式不一样，它是压力式的，当它浸泡时间一到就可以下压压杆完成冲煮，冲煮方式极其简单方便。

本文是少数派 2021 年度征文 活动 #生活 21 标签下的入围文章。本文仅代表作者本人观点，少数派对标题和排版略作调整。
和往年不同，今年文章的数据表现将很大程度上决定征文活动的最终走向，包括「双倍稿酬（由飞书赞助）」活动奖励、最终票选名单以及征文奖品类型。如果你喜欢这篇文章，不妨通过充电或评论的方式支持作者。

前言
收到我人生最大的一笔单篇稿费的这天晚上，我失眠了。
当然不是因为钱多烧的，而是白天咖啡喝多了 2021 年最后一篇稿子赚来的稿酬成功让我回想起了成为少数派作者的这一年。
我是 Leslie，一个致力于让没有医学背景的人听懂医生在说啥的科普作者，一年以前，我还只是一个潜水的小透明，现在却混进了少数派的作者群。不过和作者群里两百多个大佬不一样，我不太厉害。在「高效工作」领域，我是个吊车尾，不会编程，不会拆电脑修手机，不会摄影，不会录播客，不会剪视频；在「品质生活」方面，我不会马伽术，不会做厉害的咖啡或是诱人的饭菜，不会种菜，不会俄语，没有惊人的读书量和阅片量，去过的地方也很少。在以上知识技能和经历方面相信很多读者都可以来无情地碾压我。而且我还是个内向的「社恐」。
但你既然已经读到了这篇文章，说明我对这个社区还是有一点点价值的。一直以来我写的多是具体的医学健康话题，这次，我想讲点柔软的，讲讲在成为了少数派作者的这一年，我这样的普通人在坚持写作之后，在网络上终于开始 reach out 之后，有了什么样的改变和思考。希望可以鼓励到和我有着类似渴望或相同困境的读者。
在关系中成长——和编辑的故事
正如《也许你该找个人聊聊》的作者所说，人和人是在关系中成长的。
我向来习惯在现实生活和社交网络中对陌生人保持缄默，而在少数派上写稿、加入作者群，让我产生了新的和人的联结，我认识了好多编辑，有的勇敢，有的善良，有的很宽容，有的很硬汉。在这样的交流中我除了交了十几篇稿…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10分钟自救
如果你通过搜索引擎找到这篇文章，那么你可能已经被动物接触，存在可能感染狂犬病的风险，因此这段我用最短的时间告诉你怎么判断以及怎么做。
什么情况下应打疫苗
“和危险的动物接触”之后，你就有了感染狂犬的风险。按照动物危险程度降序排列：

蝙蝠（尤其是吸血的）
狗、猫（野生或不确定有没有定期免疫的家养宠物）
雪貂、松鼠、花栗鼠
狐狸、狼、貉

接触动作是指以下的行为：

被动物咬伤或抓伤，皮肤有破损，与动物唾液有接触
与蝙蝠任意形式的接触
无出血的擦伤或抓伤，或被动物轻咬（没咬破）

如果你遇到以上情况，就大概率需要注射狂犬疫苗进行免疫，具体原因在后文解释。
去哪里打疫苗
官方网站
最官方的应该是国家卫健委做的集合页面，但是可能因为各地卫健委和疾控中心的网址调整，我看里面不少省份的链接都无法访问了。
此外我还找到一个疾控中心做的检索页面，这个页面加载比较慢，且只适合电脑端查看。
我写的工具
为了便于大家在移动端中查找，我做了一个网页，里面记录重要的自救内容和各地疫苗注射点的文件。大家如果发现数据有误或者有更新，可以在本文最后留言，我看到之后会更新内容。
 
如果以上的工具中都没能查到你身边的疫苗注射点，也可以致电当地卫健委或疾控中心咨询。
注射疫苗的流程
大家通过这些工具可以查找到附近的疫苗注射点，可以先致电联系，确保注射点目前可以进行注射。避免因为没有疫苗、医院封禁而被拒之门外。
在去注射点前，最好能带上你的身份证和医保卡，以备医院挂号之需。
抵达注射点后，可以向分诊台的工作人员咨询具体的注射流程；如果你是晚上去的，也可以找急诊的工作人员咨询。
在接触动物后的 24 小时内是最重要的免疫时间，因此如果第一家注射点受阻，还来得及去第二家注射点，不要着急。
医生会询问你的情况，然后判断是否需要注射狂犬疫苗，如果需要的话，会给你开一张清单，你需要按照这个清单上的时间按时…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System76 分享了其即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板草图。看起来令人惊叹！




System76 令人兴奋的用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的开发工作现在正在进行中。

虽然我们已经用早期的代码 试过了，但我们现在可以看到更多的东西。从其 GitHub 仓库 和 Figma 文档 的一些原型中，我们可以看到它的更多信息。

值得注意的是，我们可以看到顶部面板和系统托盘，正如你在 COSMIC 桌面上所期望的那样。

这仍是一项正在进行的工作，可能会有变化。

COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板

Pop!_OS 依赖于 GNOME 扩展来通过顶部面板或系统托盘图标提供更多的功能。

随着即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面，看起来他们正在创建新的小程序，与当前的外观相融合，并提供更多的功能。

开发者 Eduardo Flores 分解研究 了它，发现了关键的区别以及 System76 的目标是如何使其发挥作用。

而且，这也是它更有趣的地方：


看起来 System76 正在摆脱传统的“扩展”，计划为第三方小程序设计一个 API，这与 KDE、XFce 和其他公司的做法类似。

这是一个令人兴奋的消息，将使 COSMIC 成为一个更强大的桌面环境，使其可以扩展和定制。


另外，似乎这些小程序也可以和顶部面板一起放在坞站里。我们会在其未来的某个测试版中看到更多的实际情况。

在这里，让我重点介绍一下从现有的草图中观察到的基本变化：

1、声音小程序



与我们现在所拥有的相比，COSMIC 的目标是增加细化的控制，如选择输入/输出设备、在顶部面板上切换媒体控制的选项、控制媒体播放，以及访问声音设置。

虽然草图没有显示专辑封面，但在发布前会包括它。

作为参考，以下是 Pop!_OS 顶部面板选项现在的样子。



2、电源小程序



很高兴看到有一个专门的电源按钮来快速访问系统设置、锁屏和注销。

另外，暂停、重启和关机的按钮应该可以提高可用性，关闭计算机不用额外的点击。

3、网络小程序

虽然你可以很容易地打开或关闭有线、无线网络，但会弹出一个占据了整个屏幕的单独窗口来选择 Wi-Fi 网络并输入密码。



但是，看起来我们终于可以在这里输入密码，连接到可用的无线网络，并重试失败的连接，而不必从活动窗口分心。所有这些都发生在系统托盘上的网络小程序上，如上面的截图所示。

同样，你可以看到关于你的有线连接的更多信息，包括 IP 地址和速度。

4、日期、时间和日历小程序



最重要的日历小程序看起来更加实用，信息量更大。通知区不再驻留在这里（它现在有一个单独的小程序），使它的体验更干净，可以把注意力放在你关注的东西上。

一些细微的视觉改进，比如用重点颜色来突出日历中的某一行，应该会使它更容易理解。

5、通知中心



正如我前面提到的，通知现在有一个独立的空间。通知小程序会将所有的通知堆积起来，并允许你在需要时展开它们，或者将它们全部清除。

我们仍然有“请勿打扰”开关，并可以快速访问通知设置。

6、图形模式小程序



这对笔记本电脑用户来说应该是非常有用的，可以在图形模式之间无缝切换，并可以看到当前使用的哪种模式。

除了所有这些，还有一个蓝牙小程序、一个电池电源模式小程序，以及一些其他的东西，比如改变输入语言或输入源的能力。





鉴于这是初次看到使用 Rust 开发 COSMIC 桌面顶部面板的外观，看来我们有很多东西要去看了。

总结

总的来说，System76 正准备为我们提供一个高度可定制但又简化的 COSMIC 桌面版本。

而所有这些都应该有助于形成一种独特的桌面体验。当然，明年你就得在 Pop!_OS 中和 GNOME 说再见了。

你怎么看？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法！

Matrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。
文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。

手机虚拟机是什么？
手机虚拟机，用过电脑虚拟机的听到应该也不会陌生，其实就是内置在手机本体内的又一个系统。它虽然是模拟真机环境，但与本机系统最大的区别在于：你拥有对该系统的自主掌控权，也就是常说的「自带 root」或者「免 root」，多用于软件测试（包括安装非官方渠道应用）和应用多开。

提到这里，不免要区分下云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机。
云手机、Android 模拟器和手机虚拟机的区别
云手机：运行在 ARM 架构（适用于移动通讯领域）的服务器上，性能由服务器决定，用户需要通过远程访问云手机操控，不影响本机系统，但也存在网络延迟现象。
Android 模拟器：其实与手机虚拟机类似。Android 模拟器运行在电脑端，需要通过键盘鼠标来操控。对于习惯手游的用户来说，除特殊需求，使用频率并不算高。
手机虚拟机：运行在手机内，占用手机内存和运算能力，因而手机性能的高地直接决定了虚拟机的运行流畅度，优势是共享真机网络。
三者各有优势，加上成本因素（包括金钱和操作）来考量的话，倾向使用手机虚拟机的人越来越多。毕竟对于生活玩家来说，一台手机上就能免费完成应用多开、软件测试的需求，何乐而不为。
常见的手机虚拟机有哪些，优缺点是什么？
真机性能越好，虚拟机运行才会越流畅，类比在手机里运行的游戏应用。这几年各大手机厂商都在疯狂给手机加配置，又正是洞察到了我们的需求。
市场上主流的三款虚拟机也都一一使用过一段时间（仅以酷安上的数据为参照）。

VMOS Pro、光速和 51 虚拟机，三者其实大同小异，最受欢迎的多开，悬浮窗，挂机等…]]></summary>

接上一篇文章中讨论过的新技术要具备哪些特点，而良好的性能是新技术“好不好”的一个测量维度，本文主要讨论内存方面的性能，一提到内存大家可能会想到GC，多多少少也会说出一些GC的基础知识，但是很多人对这方面有过的的优化措施却并不是很了解，于是本文讨论一些GC的历史优化，这也是这周在研究的一个技术进阶，好了，该发车了~。
关于GC大多数程序员都只是知道怎么判定垃圾，哪几种回收方式，回收过程这些知识，当然面试官也主要考察的这部分知识。但是我们知其然也要知其所以然，所以笔者从历代GC技术的优化方案来进行讲解，涉及到回收过程中一些细节和改动优化点，从这些优化点当中学到的不只是针对GC的，同样的优化方案在项目中或者在理解更深层次的知识的时候也会起到帮助作用
1.GC Roots遍历提升效率
以往做法
当垃圾回收器线程进行GC时，
第一步需要找到GC Roots；
第二步通过GC Roots进行遍历堆中引用GC Roots的对象形成引用链；
第三步，将不在引用链中的对象标记进行标记（需要回收的对象），或者标记引用链中的对象（需要复制，整理的对象），具体标记哪种对象根据堆中的分代内存不同和采用的垃圾回收算法来确定。
可优化地方以及优化原理
上述过程第二步中遍历堆中引用GC Roots的对象，这部分随着堆内存的越来越大需要的时间也会逐步增长。如果能够提前知道堆中哪部分内存是引用，来判断是否引用GC Roots这样效率是不是会更高一些。
没错，JVM从Exact VM开始就已经采用了准确式内存管理即知道哪部分内存是引用；而且在即时编译的过程中我也会知道栈中或者寄存器里哪部分内存是引用。这个时候我用一个数据结构来存储这些信息，在第二步中就不需要遍历整…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KDE 开始 15 分钟错误消除计划

该计划用于集中修复许多影响 KDE 桌面的低级错误，这些错误用户在 15 分钟或更短时间内就能发现。其列入标准是，这些错误受 KDE 的默认设置影响，100% 可重现，一些基本的东西不工作或看起来有视觉上的缺陷，可能导致崩溃，需要重启或终端命令来解决或没有解决方法，最近回退的错误，或有超过五个重复的错误报告。在该计划中，第一批 有 56 个错误需要处理。


老王点评：这些不起眼而很重要的工作，才真正能将 KDE 打磨成主流桌面环境。




Opera 发布专门的内置加密钱包的浏览器

Opera 发布 了一个 Web3 Crypto 浏览器，内置加密货币钱包，更易于访问加密货币/NFT 交易所、去中心化应用 dApp 等。Opera 表示新浏览器旨在简化 Web3 用户体验。Web3 是基于区块链的去中心化互联网，是目前加密货币支持者最热衷的新事物。该浏览器的钱包支持包括以太坊、比特币等加密货币。不过，该浏览器在国内被禁止使用。


老王点评：虽然 Opera 逐渐从主流浏览器中落后，但是它专注于游戏、加密货币等领域的努力还是值得赞赏。




因 5G 干扰，国际航空公司正在减少飞往美国的航班

美国的移动电话公司正在推出的 5G 服务，使用频率在 3.7 至 3.98GHz 之间的无线电频谱，即所谓的 C 波段。国际航空业担心美国 5G 服务过于接近雷达高度计使用的频谱，也就是 4.2 至 4.4GHz 之间，因而正在减少飞往美国的航班。但国际航空业认为，欧洲没有面临同样的风险，在欧洲，5G 服务使用频率较慢的 3.4 至 3.8GHz 范围的频谱，和雷达高度仪使用的频谱之间有更大的缓冲区。此外，欧洲也限制了机场附近的 5G 天线的功率和角度，避免了对飞机的干扰。


老王点评：新技术带来的新挑战，不知道国内的 5G 情况如何。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[POSIX，你肯定在各种在线论坛和文章中，听到过这个缩写，或读到过关于它的信息。程序员和系统开发人员似乎最关心这个问题。它听起来很神秘，虽然有很多关于这个主题的好资料，但一些讨论区（简洁是它们的特点）并没有详细说明它是什么，这可能会让人困扰。那么，POSIX 到底是什么？



POSIX 简介

与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。

当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。

该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。

为什么有 POSIX？

一句话：可移植性。

60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。

IBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。

不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…]]></summary>

[国产剧] 开端

关键词：剧情

「这局废了，重开吧。」「我不下车了。」

@潘誉晗：45 路公交车在十字路口爆炸，强烈的火光不仅打破了一日的宁静，也带走了许多人的生命。女大学生李诗情和游戏设计师肖鹤云却从这场爆炸中复活，两人一次次经历爆炸，一次次「死而复生」，却也一次次「开局重来」进入了循环……
这部由正午阳光出品，腾讯独播的开年网剧真的「炸」了，虽然同类型的作品早有《土拨鼠之日》《源代码》和《明日边缘》珠玉在前，可毕竟这是国内第一部循环向的剧集，所以总归有一些带着担忧的期待，但一口气看完八集的感觉很好。而本剧又是以 2013 年的厦门公交爆炸案为原型，所以…]]></summary>

说的就是这位 @东北少女vivian 同学：
可以复刻薛记炒货的网红爆款酸奶柑橘片吗？这玩意100多一斤就那么点…
网上几乎没有可用的方子！
受 @知乎美食  邀请，参与「人人都是年菜大厨」活动，让大家在问题下许愿，一眼我就看到了这个心愿，“酸奶柑橘片”这玩意最近风很大啊不是么？！
其实我早就听说过了，但是我不爱吃桔子就一直没下手，直到看到这个心愿，没忍住剁了下手。
就，妙啊。
柑橘还是那个貌不惊人的柑橘，白巧还是那个甜死人毫不愧疚的白巧，两人一组合，就成了网红零食了，关键是，这网红零食它好吃————
也好贵。

如果说去年过年的年度DIY零食新贵是奶枣，那今年盲猜就是这个了。因为它实在优势太明显：
正好赶上柑橘上市季节、价格便宜、步骤简单、酸甜适口、耐存放、老少咸宜。
于是就决定做这个给你们看了！
嘘，别问原因，问就是家里收了3箱子朋友从各地寄来的桔子、橙子等，我实在消耗不完了（此处感谢 @陈大可 等人提供的原料）。

但是由于对网上教程的极度不信任，我还是用分组法，在不同的步骤试验了很多种方法去制作，旨在让你们看完我这一篇絮絮叨叨的回答就都会做。

所以以下，除了正常的“烘烤柑橘片——融化巧克力——裹巧克力涂层——冷却”这4个谁都能看明白的步骤外，我会在每一个步骤都列出来你可能失败的原因，包括但不仅限于：

1、柑橘的选择——决定成品造型和是否发苦
2、烤箱、果脯机、空气炸锅、电暖气哪家强——决定果干烘烤时间和成色
3、巧克力的选择和配料——决定色泽、脆度和味道平衡
4、冷却时间和注意事项——决定保存时间和口感保持

看到这里，你就已经知道我翻车了多少回才有信心写下这个教程了。

那么，“我去买几个橘子，你就站在此地，不要走动。”[1]

小十年前跑过一次环法旅行，这些年也跑过3次穿越西欧的路，国内跑过2次无人区和1次青藏线，单人肝路程的话要数有一次年初一从广州开去乌镇……


车型：启辰R50，HR16DE引擎，也就是1.6L自然吸气，5MT变速箱，没有定速巡航，没有ESP电子稳定系统，前轮胎是两条刚换的300多块的好运轮胎（年29开坏轮胎了，只有好运轮胎店开门），后轮胎是开了4年5万公里的玛吉斯，一条250元。

A、车辆的准备


1、轮胎和制动系统
轮胎是汽车唯一与地面接触的零部件，其重要性不言而喻。首先，我们需要保证轮胎胎壁没有鼓包，因为鼓包会直接导致爆胎，车辆会失控。其次，我们要确认轮胎没有过度磨损，如果都快成光头胎了，还是赶紧换掉吧，快过年了，汽修店的人都快手关门回老家啦。再者，我们需要一套胎压监测，这比每次都下车踢一脚轮胎来得靠谱。
出发之前，我们必须到4S店或汽修店检查一下制动系统是否运作正常，刹车片是否已经磨到底了，制动液是否该换了。
.
2、三大件
如果真的要跑很久的长途，不妨提早做一个小保养，换换油水，检查刹车，顺便让4S店或者快修店师傅给你检查一下发动机、变速箱、底盘“三大件”是否性能完备。
谁都不想车子在前不着村后不着店的地方抛锚，这还是春节期间呢，谁来拯救你？钱给够当然有救援，但没人想多花两三倍的钱对吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一年又一年，Apple 在今天发布了由 iPhone 13 Pro 拍摄的虎年新春影片《卷土重来》，这部影片是 Apple 发布的第五支新春影片，也是与过去四部影片完全不同的一部作品。

首先是时长，《卷土重来》的片长有 23 分钟之久，与之相比，2018 年发布的首支 Apple 新春影片《三分钟》的片长为 7 分钟、去年发布的《阿年》为 12 分钟。其次是类型元素，与过去人物关系、道具场景都相对简单的四部影片不同，我们在《卷土重来》中可以看到传统武打、好莱坞科幻、乡土情怀、幽默喜剧、父子亲情等多种电影风格类型，道具和场景方面包含了机器人和机器狗、全地形车、火星基地、飞船模型等等，制作规模进一步突破。
《卷土重来》讲述的是电影梦碎的儿子，跟一个异想天开的父亲，为了把无人问津的村子打造成网红景点，率领一众村民拍摄火星大电影的故事。身为替身武打演员的儿子，在一次拍摄中不慎受伤之后无奈回村，接受了电影梦破灭现实的他，希望利用多年积攒下来的积蓄，将父亲接去城市生活，告别土地贫瘠、生活环境恶劣的乡村。父亲则希望为乡村拍摄一部影片，希望通过这部影片将乡村走出困境，同时也帮助儿子圆一次电影梦。
影片从父子之间的矛盾作为展开，儿子希望带领父亲逃离「除了沙尘一无所有，荒凉得跟个火星似的」乡村，前往城市生活；父亲则从儿子的话语中收获了不一样的理解：那就拍一部关于「火星」的电影。这里展现的，不仅是现实中父母与子女常有的矛盾冲突，也代表了两代人对于困难、梦想的不一样的看法：20 岁的儿子虽然怀揣电影梦，但是遇到困难就决定接受现实、放弃梦想；60 岁的父亲却对梦想执着追求，不仅希望帮助儿子圆一次电影梦，也对于生活了一辈子的乡村仍抱有希望，对于村民抱有希望。

影片背后留下的不少线索，也埋藏了对于现代生活的各种还原。比如父亲希望拍摄视频放到网上，将村子打造成网红景点，正是当下短视频时代的一种社会缩影…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不论身在何处，华人最重要的节日无疑是春节。除夕之夜全家团圆，共同迎接新年的到来。
不过，除夕当日除了准备年夜饭之外，另一项重要的活动就是大扫除。最初是一种祛除病疫的宗教仪式，后来慢慢发展成了必不可少的习俗，被视作是在新年里远离秽气、晦气和穷气的象征。
图源：unsplash
即使对这样的传统及其附带的意义并不感兴趣，每隔一段时间的大扫除也是十分必要的。对频繁搬家的人来说，至少还可以趁着收拾行李的机会整理、清洁；但如果常年住在同一间房子里，被挡住的卫生死角很容易就被忽视，经年累月下来灰尘和病菌聚集，对居住者的身体健康也会造成一定影响。甚至可以趁着大扫除的时候，对家中物品做个清点，在旧年「断舍离」掉不常用的东西，给家里腾出更多的空间。
接下来将介绍我在大扫除时的一些基本思路，以及一些（希望是）具体可行的操作方法。与上一篇日常家务的文章不同的是，本篇中的清洁会更细致，所需时间更长，体力消耗更大，并且可能需要迁延多日才能完成。
图源：storyset
需要注意的是每个人的房间格局、装修材料、家具设施、使用习惯、清洁要求，以及所在地的气候、习俗、家中人口各有不同，也就带来了清洁方式的差异，请根据自身情况适配。另外，由于笔者近几年来都在国外居住，对国产的家务神器缺乏认知，用的基本上都是最基础的器具，也没有钱买扫地机器人和新风这种所需不菲的设备……如果各位在阅读过程中发现有些问题可以用某种神器替代，也欢迎在评论区喂我安利。（如果直接空投我一个扫地机器人的话也可以！谢谢老板！）
如果以上都可以接受的话，那我们就开始吧！
前置准备
大扫除在所有家务活里并不能算轻松。如果能够提前准备的话，就能减少很多在扫除过程中的困扰。
在这里，「提前准备」包含了两重含义。

第一层是指最好能提前准备好扫除的相关用品，特别是平时不怎么做家务、家里也没有储备的。春节前后，快递的需求增多，因为放…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[哦，这个是我的领域。我暂且认为，我在这个领域，全国范围能排前100问题不大。知乎比我专业的人，应该不会超过10个（我抛砖引玉，其他曾经同行，你们自己看情况）。
我做的是变速箱标定，是某国际大厂，认定的中国区域，仅有的2个驾驶性评估工程师（另外一位是我徒弟）。带我的师傅，是国内某厂混动方案起草人。我一度考虑找自主品牌融资，创业搞变速箱，后来发现自己落后了 ，于是就不搞了，改行了。
通俗的讲，主要解决2个问题， 换挡点+换挡质量。
首先你说的硬件问题， 是很难创新的，ZF的8AT，奇瑞的CVT，爱信6AT，Getrag的7dct也好，他们是设计好变速箱，就疯狂卖，一般6000-15000块一台，价格关键看扭矩，看你采购量。硬件的每个档位的传动比，基本结构，都不会改动了 ，最多改变下和发动机 链接处，就是表面功夫，密封更好这些。主要调整的是软件。
1）先解决有无问题：换挡点
这块需要根据每个发动机来，发动机的万有特性（就是扭矩、转速、油门开度。功率用的其实是很少）
这里面决定了油耗，动力性， 当然你可以设置几套模式，什么雪地模式（2挡起步），运动模式（推迟换挡点），经济模式（早换挡），内部还会存在爬坡等。当然不同厂家逻辑是不一样的，有的是一套图谱，根据运动，经济等修正，有的可能是几套。
但是，这些本质都是有无问题 ，客户根本不关心，车评人也不关心。
要关心的是：换挡质量（从有到优）
2：换挡质量：聪明、迅捷、平顺
最好的换挡，就要像电车那样，客户感知不到，在所有评估里，这个都是10分，因为那是真正的车随脚动，油车即使保时捷帕拉梅拉，也给不了10分。
传统油车有如下几种问题
   2.1：换挡时间问题
    DCT一般最短200毫秒左右，长的话1.5s也是存在的（我们还做过一个2.3s的车）。
你想想，1.5S你怎么接受？一脚下去，1.5S之后车才动
为什么会存在1.5s？因为驾…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开始这篇文章之前，先说说这两天我在清理电脑存储上的一个插曲。
有着良好电脑使用习惯的我，直到上一次打开 Mac 的储存空间界面，还始终保持着预留至少 50G 的空间来避免可用存储空间过少造成的「心理健康」问题，直到某天清理电脑无用软件时，突然发现电脑只剩 20G 可用，就在那一瞬间，我觉得我与存储空间的多年战斗宣告完败。
一番排查过后，最占用存储空间的是不出意外的微信和企业微信两大「巨头」，足足有 60G 的空间消耗。这些聊天记录的缓存，在电脑端占用的空间寸土寸金，却不让我十分珍惜，因为他们杂乱无章，脱离了微信就再也无法访问，偶尔同步最近记录还会抽风，语音同步也是个老大难问题，想要全量的聊天记录检索，必须搬出已经占用 10G 的手机微信。
想到前一阵子微信拟推出付费的聊天记录云端存储功能，以及越来越大的微信存储占用，我开始未雨绸缪，考虑谨慎处理我已经愈渐庞大和失控的微信数据。
定期的全量备份以建立保障
微信自带的备份和迁移
因为一直是 iPhone 用户，所以能够采取的备份方案一般也以官方的为主。下图这两个界面应该所有人都不陌生，电脑端提供的一直都是备份和恢复的操作，而如果是换手机的场景，也支持将设备连接到同一 WiFi，直接在手机间迁移聊天记录。这两个方案都能解决问题，但如果聊天记录过多的话，同步速度会不太可控。

说到手机间迁移聊天记录的场景，ColorOS、MIUI 等国内 Android 系统基本都支持微信数据的云端同步功能，部分 Android 系统还支持选择性恢复聊天记录，不仅对于聊天记录的留存多一份保障，还让随时可能过期的临时文件得以自动地存储下来。
相比而言，iOS 虽然也具备机器间数据整体的迁移功能，不过前提是需要借助电脑或 iCloud 云端同步来实现。需要说明的是，iCloud 的备份是对于 iOS 本地文件的「一锅端」，相比微信自带备份功能的缺点是只…]]></summary>

从爱上她，到现在，直至往后余生，我都在为向她吹的最后一个牛还债。
那个牛皮是这样吹的：

宋词很简单，如果你做我女朋友，以后每个七夕节，我都给你写一首！

没想到，后来我俩真的在一起了，看样子这辈子也会一直在一起。
没办法，为了维持“守信”“才华”人设不塌房，我每年都会强迫自己在七夕节前一两个月切换角色，假装诗人。

10年前还在用手写

2021年已经用app生成了
假装诗人三板斧
不知不觉牛皮吹过了10年，我也写完了10首宋词，说实话很有成就感，但也挺累人的。
因为一个脑袋空空的当代俗人，想要冒充古代文豪不穿帮，需要用很多工具，才能催眠自己“我觉得我挺行”，来维持自己的诗词创作之路：
诗词典籍：假装自己满腹经纶。 用来经常翻阅七夕相关的诗词名作，培养语感。常用工具有宋词三百首、诗经等书籍、以及古诗词典等诗词软件。
词谱韵表：假装自己精通韵律。 用来选择词牌，查找词谱，对应平仄。常用工具有白香词谱、平水韵、中华新韵等书籍和对应软件。
记录创作：假装自己落笔成诗。 用来灵感收集，细化修改。常用工具有纸笔以及word、印象笔记等软件。
迭代：写拉松诗词创作系统
在这十年间，我的创作流程逐渐稳定，但工具层面却常起波澜。一些纸质书籍内容被移动APP替代，也有一批软件逐渐停止维护，一直期待要是有一套自己的诗词创作系统就好了。
今年我福至心灵，在写拉松上试着搭建自己的创作系统，发现竟然非常顺畅，基本能覆盖80%的功能。并且因为这套系统可以在手机上随时执行，对碎片时间的利用率非常高，所以大大缩短了我的创作周期，非常赞。
写拉松是啥？
写拉松，又名writeathon。这是作者对写拉松的介绍：

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第2天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」。
前言
当然，大部分人(包括我)遇到这种问题的第一反应，应该是这样的：

不好意思放错图了，应该是这个：

而现在呢，正好在重构过程中遇到了一点小需求，让我不由得想起这个方案来：

我们先抛开成本、人力、可行性之类的事实不提，难道这套方案真的没有可行性？🤪
貌似还是有那么🤏一丢丢的
这里先不谈瞳孔图片怎么处理，假如真给你搞出图片了，应该怎么处理呢？
在Flutter中，对图片主题色进行分析提取，应该怎么搞：
在原生上，其实已经有很多应用实现了对图片主题色进行提取的操作，这说明方案至少是有实现可能性，可能性还不小；（比如说 android 的 Palette ）
那么按照国际惯例，又到了抄原生代码的时候了：
Palette 源码解析
Palette的原理其实并不复杂，跳到启动解析的地方，可以看到其代码量并不多，而且有比较详细注释说明：

根据注释简单总结下步骤：
1、缩放压缩图片，没必要整那么大，并根据最后缩放效果同步计算区域之类的信息；
2、调用 getPixelsFromBitmap ，解析图片的像素信息，存到数组中；
3、构造 ColorCutQuantizer ，计算主题色都是哪些：

1、降级颜色，将颜色从RGB888降级为565(反正用不到那么精细)
2、根据构造的过滤器，去掉不需要计算分析的色值；
3、判断过滤后的色值是否符合要求：

1、如果过滤后的色值数量小于设定的最大颜色数量，那么直接返回结果；
2、如果过滤后的色值数量大于设定的最大颜色数量，那么调用quantizePixels量化处理色值：

1、构造一个名为VBox的类，用于存放最大最小色值等信息，方便获取平均值（说白了就是划分区域，将区域信息放到这个类里面）
2、不断寻找色值中点，分割VBox并更新保存的区域信息，直到分割后的VBox数量达到规定的最大颜色数量；
3、计算各个VBox中的平均色值，并返回，即可得到主题色；
感觉搞个流程图看起来比较好？
一句话总结：
说白了，其实思路很简单，将图片经过压缩处理后，划分为规定的区块，最后返回各个区块的颜色平均值；
那么接下来要做的事，就是把原生的代码翻译过来
如果单单是翻译，其实问题不大，简单描述下跟Android中做法不一样的部分：
工具类这块问题不大，区别主要是在读取图片数据这块：
在 Android 中，对图片的操作基本通过的是bitmap来做处理；因此读取图片像素信息，可以通过bitmap.getPixels方法来做；
在 Flutter 中，对图片信息的获取，则是通过Image来做的，以一个本地文件为例：需要这么做：

PS ：另外发现一个小点，不注意的话，还是能带来了一定困扰的：
在Android中，颜色数值是一个int；
在Dart中，也一样是int：
但是Android，或者说java的int和dart的int，范围是不一样的；
举个例子，同样是红色的FF0000，Dart中FF0000的值是: 4294901760 ，而在java中，红色对应的int值是： -65536
所以在开发Dart的过程中，别被java中熟知的int范围影响到了，要不然就会像我一样，调bug的时候，刚上来看到这个数值那叫一个一脸懵逼；
结语
还是老规矩，国际惯例，附上效果图，列表按区块像素数排序（相当于在图片中的权重了）：
首先测试用的图片是这张：

Android的：

Flutter的：

怎么感觉我这个flutter版本的更贴近于主题色呢……这android原生中，黑色区域是第三高的权重，看图片.是这样么？……
不过权重最高的部分，都没什么异议～～～当然，一般我们也不会选权重低的部分当作主题色吧
接下来要做的事，就是分析ImageProvider部分，看下flutter的图片加载流程是什么样的，最后怎么将这个工具类应用到Image小部件上面～
最后呢，首尾呼应，重新回到标题中提到的问题，经过这么一系例处理之后，相信大家已经认可了这套方案并得出了统一的结论：
遇到提这种需求的产品，还是先打一顿比较好，谁打赢了听谁的
更新 ：后来发现其实有个库实现了这个效果…………此题完结

本周话题：前端与后端，谁更难？
"黑客新闻"（Hacker News）是美国最大的程序员社区，我每天都看，周刊的很多内容就来自那里。

有一天，我看到一个帖子。
一个前端程序员说，他不想干前端了，咨询大家意见，转到后端是否可行。
我从2007年开始从事前端开发，到了现在，很多新技术已经不擅长了。每次打开 Chrome 开发者工具，看到那些我不知道的新功能，我总是选择忽略。
很多我熟悉的工具和功能，都已经或将被弃用。现在的前端开发都在 npm 环境，经常有难懂的报错，好不容易搜到答案，又要花很多时间修复本地开发环境。
即使那些最简单的任务，现在的开发方式也比以前复杂，要考虑很多边界场景。我能够完成的工作，不断得缩小。
我失去了继续在前端工作的信心，转到后端，会不会容易一些。
简单说就是，他觉得前端越来越难，自己跟不上，无法坚持下去了。他想知道，后端会不会更容易一些，转成后端开发是否可行？

可以想象，讨论这种问题，一定是众说纷纭。
原帖下面，各种意见都有。支持的一方说，前端现在确实变得非常复杂，技术工具的更新速度太快，开发和维护的难度超过了后端。
反对的一方说，后端也很难，如果你适应不了 Node.js，改行写 C++/Java/Go 也会很痛苦，千万不要草率做决定。

难易是主观感受，没有办法精确衡量，人与人之间不可比较。所以我觉得，讨…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java语言提供了synchronized关键字用于加锁，但这种锁一是很重，二是获取时必须一直等待，没有额外的尝试机制。
从Java 5开始，引入了一个处理并发的java.util.concurrent包，它提供了大量更高级的并发功能。其中Lock是juc包下面的一个接口，ReentrantLock是它的常用实现类。
ReentrantLock是一个可重入的，API层面上的互斥锁，用于替代synchronized加锁。它拥有与synchronized相同的并发性和内存语义，但是添加了定时锁等候、可中断锁等候等一些特性。
基本使用
传统synchronized代码：
public class Counter {
    private int count;

    public void add(int n) {
        synchronized(this) {
            count += n;
        }
    }
}

如果用ReentrantLock替代，代码为：
public class Counter {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int count;

    public void add(int n) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
        // synchronized do something
            count += n;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

「这是我参与2022首次更文挑战的第4天，活动详情查看：2022首次更文挑战」
一、概述
1.1 描述
上文介绍到了SQLite Api，今天咱们介绍一下 Room ( Android Jetpack 重要成员之一 )。
Room 持久性库在 SQLite 之上提供了一个抽象层，以允许流畅的数据库访问，同时利用 SQLite 的全部功能。特别是，Room 提供以下好处：
SQL 查询的编译时验证。
方便的注释，最大限度地减少重复和容易出错的样板代码。
简化的数据库迁移路径。
由于这些考虑，我们强烈建议您使用 Room 而不是直接使用 SQLite API。
1.2 主要部件
Room 包含三个主要组件：
保存数据库并用作与应用程序持久数据的底层连接的主要访问点的数据库类。
表示应用数据库中表的数据实体。
数据访问对象(DAO)，提供你的应用可用于在数据库中查询、更新、插入和删除数据的方法。
数据库类为您的应用程序提供与该数据库关联的 DAO 实例。反过来，应用程序可以使用 DAO 从数据库中检索数据作为关联数据实体对象的实例。该应用程序还可以使用定义的数据实体来更新相应表中的行，或创建新行以进行插入。下图说明了 Room 不同组件之间的关系。

二、创建 Room
2.1 添加依赖项
在 app/build.gradle文件中添加依赖：
dependencies {
    //Room
    def room_version = "2.4.1"
    implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:$room_version"
    annotationProcessor "androidx.room:room-compiler:$room_ver…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[0 写在最前面
2021年于我最大的收获，真的是，终于把最后一颗智齿拔掉了。身边熟悉我的人都知道，我这颗智齿已经折磨了我好几年，每次我信誓旦旦发个朋友圈说今天终于要去拔牙了，到最后都是因为重重原因没能如愿。所以借着这么多年拔了四颗智齿的经历，也想和大家分享一下，智齿这件小事儿，我不是医学专业，这篇的分享纯粹是站在一个外行人角度讲讲我所知道的，我所经历的，和我所建议的，每个人的情况都不一样，如果对你们有帮助，那就最好了。但请大家具体实践的时候还是要把遵医嘱放在首位。
如果你对智齿这个话题不感兴趣，既然点开了，也请至少看看我下面两条建议。

强烈建议大家再忙也要每隔1-2年去洗一次牙。洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！洗牙很重要！不仅可以及时去除牙结石，还可以顺便发现牙齿存在的问题，早发现早治疗也能——早省钱。毕竟大多数情况下，治疗牙齿的价格和你拖的时间、牙齿的问题的严重程度是正向相关的。不信你试试？
有备孕需求的女性，强烈建议做一次全面细致的口腔检查以及及时拔除智齿。目前很多的孕检根本没把口腔检查列入。孕期整个人的激素分泌、内分泌调节等都会有很大的变化，极易引起各种口腔炎症（如智齿发炎）及牙疼，真的疼起来只能强忍，因为考虑胎儿，所以没法使用止痛药和消炎药。

1 关于智齿的简单科普
1.1 智齿是什么？
还是先简单科普一下吧。
智齿，又称智慧齿、行根牙，是指人类口腔内牙槽骨上最里面的第三颗磨牙，从正中的门牙往里数刚好是第八颗牙齿。由于它萌出时间很晚，一般在16至25岁间萌出，此时人的生理、心理发育都接近成熟，有“智慧到来”的象征，因此被俗称为“智齿”。智齿生长方面，个体有很大差异，通常情况下应该有上下左右对称的4颗牙，有的少于4颗甚至没有，极少数人会多于4颗。萌出的年龄差异也很大，有的人20岁之前萌出，有人40到50岁才长或者终生不长，这都是正常现象。1

        <id>https://sspai.com/post/71062</id>
        <link href="https://sspai.com/post/71062"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是自定义短语
macOS 与 iOS 中的键盘设置中，都有 【自定义短语】这个功能。
这个功能有什么用呢，可以很方便的输入平时常用的一些词条，比如你的住址，或邮箱。
该功能是这样的，定义一个输入码比如 mail 定义它的替换文本为 kylebingbing@163.com，这样，在你输入 mail 的时候就会被自动替换成你的邮箱。
macOS 中是这样的
 

iOS 中是这样的
 

macOS 与 iOS 的键盘中的自定义短语是同步的。所以在 macOS 上导入的短语也会出现在同账号下的 iOS 系统中。
我的需求
我是五笔用户，iOS上用的是原生的五笔输入法，但这个输入法有个问题，就是词库无法自定义，所以我就瞄准了输入法中的这个 【自定义短语】功能。我需要往里导入非常多的词几百几千或几万，一个一个加是不可能了。
上面我们已经知道 macOS 与 iOS 的自定义短语是同步的，所以只需要在 macOS 上导入词条就可以了，幸运的是 macOS 是可以批量导入的。
一、自定义短语的位置
macOS

打开键盘设置
切换标签到 自定义短语
往里面添加就可以了

iOS

打开设置
打开 【通用设置】
找到【键盘】
再点击【自定义短语】

二、如何导入导出词条
批量导入导出词条只能在 macOS 中操作
1. 导出

打开自定义短语的窗口
command + a 选中所有词条，
然后拖动这些词条到桌面，即可导出词条到桌面，此时会生成一个 .plist 的文件，其文件的内容格式如下

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<array>
<dict>
<key>phrase</key>
<string>kylebing@163.com</string>
<key>shortcut</key>
<string>mail</string>
</dict>
<dict>
<key>phrase</key>
<string>自定义短语</string>
<key>shortcut</key>
<string>tpyy</string>
</dict>
</array>
</plist>

观察这个文件结构可以看到它是由 phrase 和 shortcut 两个字段组成的。
2. 导入
你可以上面的文件结构生成自己的 .plist 文件。
导入的方法跟导出正好相反，直接拖动 .plist 文件到 自定义短语的窗口中即可，系统还会自动查重。
三、批量处理词条的工具
工具地址：
 
 
介绍一下我做的一个可以批量处理词条的工具。它可以将批量词条生成到一个 plist 文件中，直接拖动导入到自定义短语中就可以了。
比如我有这些词条需要导入，目前只有 编码-短语 这种结构，需要生成 .plist 那种 xml 结构

只需要选中需要导入的词条，点击 【导出为 .plist 文件】即可

只需要拖动生成的文件到自定义短语的窗口中，即可完成批量导入
