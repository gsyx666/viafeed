          "description": "1. What is Dask cuDF?\n\n\nDask cuDF is a library that enables users to work with large dataframes using the dask distributed computing framework. cuDF is a columnar dataframe library that is part of the NVIDIA RAPIDS initiative. Dask cuDF allows users to scale up their data processing workloads by making use of the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs.\nThere are several other libraries that provide similar functionality to dask cuDF. These include Apache Arrow, Pandas, and PySpark. However, dask cuDF has some advantages over these other libraries.\n\nThere are some challenges that come with using dask cuDF. One challenge is that it can be difficult to install and set up dask cuDF on your system. Another challenge is that dask cuDF is still under active development and its API may change in future releases. Finally, dask cuDF is not as welldocumented as some other libraries, making it difficult to learn how to use it effectively.\nThe to_csv() and from_csv() functions are the most basic ways of saving and loading dataframes. They are very simple to use and will work with any type of dataframe. However, they have some limitations. First, they can only save dataframes that fit in memory. Second, they do not support compression. Third, they are not very efficient when saving large dataframes.\nIf you're working with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go. It's much faster than Pandas and easier to use than Spark. So if you're looking for a better way to work with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go.\nStar our Github repo and join the discussion in our Discord channel to help make BLST even better!\nBLST!",

          "description": "键盘快捷键让我专注于我要传递的内容，而不是它的外观。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n从我记事起，我就一直在使用文字处理软件。当文字处理器从直接格式化转向利用样式来改变文本在页面上的显示方式时，这对我的写作有很大的推动作用。\n\r\nLibreOffice 提供了多种样式，你可以使用它们来创建各种内容。 LibreOffice 将段落样式应用于文本块，例如正文、列表和代码示例。字符样式类似，只是这些样式适用于段落内的内联词或其他短文本。使用“视图View -> 样式Styles”菜单，或使用 F11 键盘快捷键，调出样式选择器。\n\r\n\n\r\n使用样式可以更轻松地编写更长的文档。看看这个例子：作为咨询实践的一部分，我写了很多工作簿和培训材料。一个工作簿可能有 40 或 60 页长，具体取决于主题，并且可以包含各种内容，例如正文、表格和列表。我的一些技术培训材料可能还包括源代码示例。\n\r\n我有一个提供给客户的标准培训集，但我也做定制的培训计划。在处理自定义程序时，我可能会先从另一个工作簿导入文本，然后从那里开始工作。根据客户的不同，我可能还会调整字体和其他样式元素以匹配客户的样式偏好。对于其他材料，我可能需要添加源代码示例。\n\r\n要使用直接格式输入示例源代码，我需要设置字体并调整工作簿中每个代码块的边距。如果我后来决定我的工作簿应该对正文文本或源代码示例使用不同的字体，我需要返回并更改所有内容。对于包含多个代码示例的工作簿，这可能需要几个小时来查找每个源代码示例并调整字体和边距以匹配新的首选格式。\n\r\n但是，通过使用样式，我可以更新定义一次，为正文样式使用不同的字体，并且 LibreOffice Writer 会在所有使用正文样式的地方更新我的文档。同样，我可以调整预格式化文本样式的字体和边距，LibreOffice Writer 会将这种新样式应用到每个具有预格式化文本样式的源代码示例中。这对于其他文本块也是如此，包括标题、源代码、列表以及页眉和页脚。\n\r\n我最近有了一个好主意，更新 LibreOffice 键盘快捷键以简化我的写作过程。我重新定义了 Ctrl + B 设置加粗强调字符样式，Ctrl + I 设置强调字符样式，Ctrl + 空格 设置取消字符样式。这使我的写作变得更加容易，因为我不必暂停写作，这样我就可以高亮显示一些文本并选择一种新的风格。相反，我可以使用新的 Ctrl + I 键盘快捷键来设置字符样式，它本质上是斜体文本。之后我输入的任何内容都使用强调样式，直到我按 Ctrl + 空格 将字符样式重置为默认的无字符样式。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你想自己设置的，请使用“工具Tools -> 自定义Customize”， 然后单击“键盘Keyboard”选项卡以修改键盘快捷键。\n\r\n\n\r\nLibreOffice 通过样式使技术写作变得更加容易。通过利用键盘快捷键，我简化了我的写作方式，让我专注于我要交付的内容，而不是它的外观。稍后我可能会更改格式，但样式保持不变。\n\r\n图片来源：（Jim Hall，CC BY-SA 40）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/6/libreoffice-keyboard-shortcuts\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "火星快车号上 Windows 98 时期的软件得到了更新\n\r\n欧洲航天局于 2003 年发射的火星快车号已经运行了近 20 年，火星快车号包括两个部份：火星快车号卫星与小猎犬 2 号登陆器，不过小猎犬 2 号后来失去联系。卫星上的火星地下和电离层探测高级雷达（MARSIS）是 2018 年在火星上发现巨大的地下液态水层的关键，该软件使用的是基于 Windows 98 的开发环境。欧洲航天局正在升级该软件，新的软件将使 MARSIS 开启的时间延长五倍，并在每次通过时探索更大的区域。这就像是“发射近 20 年后，火星快车号上有了一个全新的仪器一样。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来 Windows 98 一直运行的也挺好。那么，微软为啥让大家一直升级呢？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nARM 最初的操作系统 35 年后仍在更新\n\r\n1987 年 6 月，Acron 推出了起价 800 英镑的 Archimedes A305 / A310 计算机。在那个年代，其产品性能设计相当先进，且提供了当时名为 Arthur 的新操作系统。两年后，它被更名为 RISC OS。如今，RISC OS 的一个分支，仍然支持 Acron 时代独特的 26 位模式，当然，目前只能运行在模拟器中。另一个分支是为 32 位的 ARM 芯片设计的，并于 2018 年开源。如今，它还在继续维护更新，近日发布了一个源自 OpenBSD 的新 TCP/IP 栈，带来了对 IPv6 的支持。但它目前还不支持 Wi-Fi，以及不支持多核处理器技术 SMP。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这么古老的操作系统，是操作系统发展历史上一块块纪念碑，更多只是回味。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n“首个桌面操作系统根社区” openKylin 发布\n\r\n昨日，麒麟软件联合普华、中科方德、麒麟信安、中兴新支点、先进操作系统创新中心等发起了中国“首个桌面操作系统根社区” openKylin 社区。所谓根社区，是指基于 Linux 内核和其他开源组件而构建，不依赖上游发行版的社区。在视频发布会上，邀请了若干院士发表了致辞，并呼吁更多的行业伙伴加入，携手打造“产业主导、平台自主、技术先进、生态丰富”的桌面操作系统根社区。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：openKylin\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来国产根社区的春天到了，这又是一家。似乎“根社区”这个说法是从开放原子开源基金会开始出现的？",

          "description": "2022 年 6 月 16 日，微软更新了其应用商店的策略。其中一项禁止了发布者对开源或免费的软件收取费用，另一项则针对的是商店使用的不合理高价。如果你在过去几年中访问过微软应用商店，你可能已经注意到，它正在成为越来越多的开源和免费产品的所在地。如果原始开发者将应用程序和游戏上传到商店，这将是有益的，但情况并非如此，因为它们是由第三方上传的。\n\r\n更糟糕的是，其中许多程序仅作为付费应用提供，而不是免费下载。换句话说，微软的客户必须付费才能购买应用商店的版本，而它们在其他地方是免费的！在应用商店中，免费版和付费版有时并存。为免费应用付费已经够糟糕的了，但这并不是用户在购买时可能遇到的唯一问题。更新也可能是一个问题，因为山寨应用可能不会像源头应用程序那样频繁或快速地更新。\n\r\n在更新的微软商店政策中，微软在 10.8.7 节下指出：\n\r\n\r\n在您决定产品或应用内购买的定价时，您的数字产品或服务的所有定价（包括销售或折扣）必须：\n\r\n遵守所有适用的法律、法规和监管要求，包括联邦贸易委员会的《反欺骗性定价指南》。您不得试图从开源软件或其他可免费获得的软件中获利，您的产品也不应提供一个（与它提供的特性和功能相比）过高的不合理定价。\n\r\n\r\n这个新策略在更新部分中得到了确认。如果开源和免费产品普遍免费提供，则它们不得在微软应用商店上出售，发布者也不得对其产品收取不合理的高价。开源和免费应用的开发者可以在微软应用商店上为其产品收费。例如，Paint.net 的开发者就是这样做的。如果微软强制执行这些策略，许多应用将从应用商店中删除。以前，开发者可以向微软报告应用程序，但在新策略下，微软可以直接控制应用的列出和提交。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/06/microsoft-to-charge-for-available-open-source-software-in-microsoft-store/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "从去年开始，随着5g的普及，云电脑也开始慢慢进入人们的视野，各路大厂纷纷下场。但是一番推广之后，云电脑并没有从此兴起，实际体验中，延迟，性能和安全性都是让我们拒绝云电脑的原因。但是，在我们的实际生活中，又确实对电脑有这样的需求：像surface go一样便捷，又像全塔台式机一样性能充足……鱼和熊掌可以兼得吗？当然可以，只需要搭建一台自己的云电脑。\n在一切的开始，我们需要明确云电脑的需求，是用笔记本/二合一平板代替台式机，而不是想现在大部分厂商宣传的那样用任何个人计算设备（手机、平板、电脑）替代台式机。在手机的小屏幕上操纵pc界面无论是工作还是娱乐都没有什么意义……而ipad这类连鼠标指针都没有的纯触控设备也无法担任这个角色。除开这些场景之后，用一台便携的轻薄本随时随地调用台式机的性能与体验，将是接下来阐述的主要应用场景。接下来我将从软件和硬件两方面讲解。\n软件\n首先是软件，实现个人搭建云电脑的关键，在于如何实现低延迟的串流。这一点parsec给出了我们很好的解决方案——p2p串流。常见的远程软件串流和云电脑串流，视频数据都要经过多个服务器的中转，就算延迟控制的较好的也是50多，想要降低延迟只能减少视频帧率。这也是为什么大部分远程软件经常会给你非常卡顿的感觉。而p2p技术则不同，可以利用全部的网络带宽，从而达到2k 60帧 20ms延迟的出色体验。这已经很接近台式机的实际操作体验了。而parsec的使用也非常简单：\n\n访问parsec官网，注册账号。\n在主机端和客户机端下载parsec软件。\n登录，点击connet即可完成连接。\n\n软件设置\n由于parsec由外国公司开发，目前并没有汉化版本，所以在这里讲解一些非开箱即用的设置\n\n在笔记本上打开client可以设置客户端配置，如decoder尽量选择独立显卡，h.265最好选择关闭，因为265的编码时长更长，会造成更高的延迟。…",

          "description": "一、背景介绍\n相信有不少朋友遇到过这样的烦恼，Windows 笔记本有几个按键坏了，笔记本又刚好过了保修期。拿到售后一问，好家伙，修笔记本的薄膜键盘要一百多的维修费。而一百多已经可以买一把机械键盘了，隐隐约约觉得这笔维修费很不值，但是那失灵的几个按键又很膈应。\n本篇文章就尝试为这样的烦恼提供解决思路，除了可以使用 PowerToys 解决外，还会列出一些备选方案。\n\n二、解决思路\n（一）使用 PowerToys 解决\n1.PowerToys 介绍\n\n又有谁能比 Microsoft 更懂 Windows 呢？\n——《少数派 2021 年度应用出炉，这些 App 是我们的「年度之选」》\n\nPowerToys 可以算是 Windows 官方出品的”外挂“或者”瑞士军刀“，其中有很多可以帮助用户提高 Windows 使用效率的功能，本篇文章就是使用键盘管理器功能。\nPowerToys 的键盘管理器功能\n2.使用指南\n读者可以看看键盘上的 F 键，能回想起来上一次使用这些 F 键是什么时候吗？没错，可以尝试把失灵的按键重映射到不常用的 F 键上解决问题。\n重映射键\n比如说笔记本键盘字母区域上面的数字键”9“坏了，而”F9“键又刚刚好在”9“键的上面，所以我把物理键”9“映射到”F9“。\n重映射键”F9“至”9“\n现在，理论上问题已经解决了，当我按下”F9“就能完成如下的输入：\nF9 = 9\nShift + F9 = Shift + 9 = （\n没错，重映射键之后相应的组合键也是生效的！\n3.提醒\n有读者可能感到疑惑，我的”9“键都坏了，那在重映射键界面怎么输入”9“呢？\n好问题，其实在首次设置的时候还是要外接一块正常的键盘的，不过这应该是可以办得到的吧。首次设置好之后，只需保持 PowerToys 的启动时运行为开启状态，那么理论上设置的重映射将一直生效。\n其次，虽然说 F 键有 12 个，理论上笔记本键盘允许坏掉的按键也有 12 个，但是我觉得坏键个数的容忍范围大约在九个左右，因为还是有几个 F 键挺常用的。比如：\nF2：文件重命名\nF5：刷新或者编程工具的快捷键\nF12：网页的检查\n这几个比较常用的 F 键不建议设置重映射。当然，其实能通过键盘管理器的重新映射快捷键解决，甚至使用重新映射快捷键还能映射远多于 12 个的失灵按键，但是到了这个阶段，还是建议直接更换键盘了。\n重映射快捷键\n（二）使用屏幕键盘解决（备选方案）\n屏幕键盘\n（三）使用 AutoHotkey 或者 AutoIt（备选方案）\n其实这类热键脚本语言程序不是那么推荐，因为要进行一定的编程。既然都通过热键解决了，为什么不用 PowerToys 的重映射键呢？\n（四）自己更换笔记本键盘（备选方案）\n其实键盘维修的物料费往往在一百元以下，剩下的都是人工费。想节省人工费自己更换键盘，其实并没有想象中那么难，先仔细检索查阅教程，跟着教程一步一步操作通常还是能成功的。\n比如我就在发现已经有 12 个按键坏掉之后，自己动手更换了笔记本的键盘，甚至还记录下了一篇教程《小米 Air 13.3 拆机换键盘步骤》。\n\n三、结语\nPowerToys 的键盘管理器能做到的不只是重映射失灵的按键，少数派文章《6 个实用技巧和软件，让你的 Windows 11 更加称心如意》就介绍了如何借助 PowerToys 的快捷键重映射处理烦人的 Teams 和小组件，而且少数派中有不少文章介绍 PowerToys 的其他强大功能。\n读者可以在 GitHub 免费下载到 PowerToys。\n（一）关联阅读\n\n微软出品的窗口管理工具，还能让你不再苦记快捷键：PowerToys\nWindows 10 官方「外挂」更新，这 3 个实用小功能你或许用得上\nWindows 10 也有「官方」取色工具了：PowerToys 0.20 更新详解",

          "description": "嘿 Siri，核酸检测。\n\n背景\n作者的所在地是郑州，目前我们实行的是每两天（48小时）一次核酸检测。\n所有公共场所或是小区等地均有专属场所码，在进入该场所之前需要使用微信或支付宝扫码，并把扫码结果出示给工作人员，扫码后你的手机上会显示如下信息：\n\n当前场所名称\n动态显示当前日期与时间\n你的姓名与身份证（部分遮挡）\n48 小时内的核酸检测结果\n疫苗接种情况\n如果是绿码，则整体的背景色为绿色\n我是腺体疫苗，只有两针剂\n其中多数公共场所必须 48 小时内的核酸检测结果为阴性才能进入，而除了成年人要每两日检测核酸之外，没有手机身份证的儿童也会在幼儿园、学校等要求下，不定期上传核酸检测结果。\n所以检测核酸几乎成了郑州人民的日常。\n静态核酸检测码\n其他地区不太清楚，但是我们这边全市公共核酸检测，使用的都是同一套系统，且每个人的检测二维码自申请之日起就是固定不变的，这也使得检测码可以被离线调取。\n如何判断你的检测码是否是静态的，可以使用这个方法：\n\n将不同时间获取的检测二维码分别截图储存；\n用微信扫描这些二维码，看里边的文本内容是不是一致的；\n如果内容每次一样，就说明为静态二维码。\n\n为了实现全民出行随时能有 48 小时的阴性核酸，全市像这样的检测屋大概有 4000 多个，分布在大街小巷。在需要做核酸检测的时候，在检测屋窗户右下角的位置让扫码设备扫一下你的核酸检测码，就可以识别出你的信息，然后进行下一步的检测。\n\n为什么要用快捷指令\n正常情况下我们调取核酸检测码，是在一个叫做「郑好办」的 APP 中，大概需要经过 4 次点击才能找到，如果网络状况差，可能等待的时间会更久。所以大多数人都把检测码截图放在相册中，使用的时候打开相册找出来就可以。\n但这种方式始终不够酷。\n使用快捷指令，除了可以迅速出示检测码之外，还可以通过 Siri 调取。而且这些动作也都同时可以在你的 Apple watch 上体验：\n\n举起手臂唤起 Siri ；\n说出「核酸检测」；\n将手表对准扫码设备。\n\n一气呵成。\n\n具体操作步骤\n想要实现单个人的二维码调取非常简单，大体思路就是，把图片转为 Base64 编码1的文本，存入快捷指令（因为快捷指令只能离线存储文本，不能存储多媒体信息），然后在快捷指令中解码呈现。具体的操作步骤如下：\n1.  准备好你的核酸检测二维码截图；\n2. 把截图裁剪为正方形，只保留二维码的部分2；\n3. 通过这个网址将二维码图片转为 Base64 编码的文本；\n4. 转换后的文本要将开头声明数据类型的这部分删除（重要）：data:image/jpeg;base64, 然后复制剩余文本；\n图片分辨率越低，转换后的代码越短，越不容易卡顿\n5. 打开快捷指令，新建一个快捷指令「核酸检测」3；\n6. 拖出一个「文本」组件，并填入第 4 步中转换好并处理完毕的 Base64 编码文本；\n7. 紧接着拖出一个「Base64 编码」组件，并设置为「解码」；\n8. 最后加入一个「快速查看」，设置显示「Base64 已编码内容」，同时将类型设置为「图像」。\n使用「快速查看」而不使用「显示结果」是为了通过Siri语音操作时也可以正常显示\n稍微进阶一下\n如果你像我一样，要时常带着儿子或者女儿去做核酸检测，那么你手机中一定存有他们的检测码。这时候我们把上边的快捷指令稍微改动一下，增加一个二级菜单，就可以实现在一个快捷指令中，调取不同人的检测二维码了。具体改动操作如下：\n1. 在原快捷指令的最上方加入「从菜单中选取」；\n2. 分别命名你要调取的二维码名称（比如：爸爸、儿子、张三等，这个步骤关系到你使用 Siri 操作时的指令语言）；\n3. 在每个菜单分类的下方，加入一个「文本」组件，并通过上方 2、3、4 步骤中处理二维码与 Base64 代码的方法，把处理好的代码分别贴进对应的「文本」组件中。\n\n带有二级菜单的快捷指令，在使用 Siri 调取的时候，需要二次对话，讲出二级菜单的名称。但是真实的场景是，如果不是为了装 X ，更多时候我还是会选择在快捷指令下用手点击调取。\n\n最后\n虽然本文是利用快捷指令来展示核酸检测码，但是同样的方法也可以用于出示其它信息。比如微信名片、推广二维码、或是一些其它你想展示的任何内容。只要你想展示的信息或者二维码是静态固定不变的，就都可以利用该快捷指令实现。你也可以把你经常会用到的静态二维码，利用上方进阶版的方法，全部做到一个快捷指令中，通过二级菜单进行调取。\n每个人对于快捷指令的认识程度各不相同，文章也希望能够让一些零基础的同学自主操作，所以很多地方写的较为详细，目的在于能帮到更多有此类需要的人群。\n感谢阅读，希望文章能对你有帮助。",

          "description": "在上一篇文章中提到目前我国的法规中没有要求有牵引资质的车辆才能拉拖挂房车，因此理论上任何家用车都可以拉拖挂（五菱宏光MINI这类微型乘用车除外）。\n不过我想补充一下，这仅仅只是法规上没有要求而已，我认为这是由于我国拖挂房车市场还没有成熟导致的相关法规缺失，以后大概率会补充相关的法律条款；在这之前我不建议小轿车、低排量SUV用户拉拖挂，除非你确实懂得怎么合理牵引拖挂、明白相关的原理、知道怎么正确安装牵引装置。\n因为这两类车动力太小不适合拉拖挂，而且99%没有针对拖挂房车这个场景做优化，也不会原厂带有牵引结构，如果你不懂相关的知识，很容易给你的前车造成损坏，不仅会危及道路、人身安全，也会影响你车子的价值。欧美地区确实有很多POLO、高尔夫、SMART拉拖挂的，那是建立在它们房车市场成熟基础上的。\n补充完毕，这一篇文章我们来聊一聊拖挂房车上牌和保险的相关事宜。\n拖挂房车要不要上牌？\n根据《道路交通安全法实施条例》第56条，“小型载客汽车只允许牵引旅居挂车或者总质量700千克以下的挂车。”有的小伙伴可能会对这条产生误解，以为只能拉700公斤以下的房车，其实这里提到了两个不同的概念：旅居挂车和700公斤以下的挂车，他们同属于挂车。\n\n \n​而旅居挂车就是我们说的拖挂房车，而根据C6驾照的准驾要求，可以驾驶的是轻型牵引挂车且两车相加小于4500KG，轻型的定义是750KG-4500KG。至于700KG以下的挂车则属于微型挂车了。\n\n​\n​\n那挂车属于机动车吗？根据2020年实施的公安部公共安全行业标准，挂车也属于机动车，因此拖挂房车也是需要上牌的，而且上牌流程和家用车基本一致，需要注意的就是拖挂房车上牌不需要拖挂的交强险，这点在下面细说；然后有的小检测站可能没有检测过拖挂房车所以会不给你检、有的车管所会要求先交购置税再检测等。\n\n​\n拖挂房车交保险要注意什么？\n​首先要明确的是，根据《道路交通安全法》，拖挂房车是不需要投保交强险的，交强险和牵引的前车共享，如果交强险的额度不够赔偿，再由拖挂的商业险进行承担。\n\n​\n所以我们只要购买拖挂房车的商业险就好了。不过由于拖挂还不流行，所以很多小城市的保险公司业务员根本不知道怎么给拖挂房车上保险，他们很可能会给你上特种车辆的保险，这种保险是很贵的，一定要沟通好。一辆十几万的拖挂房车，三者险加车损险一般1500元以内就可以搞定。\n在给拖挂房车上牌时也不需要提供拖挂的交强险，但要提交前车的交强险，这里要注意的是，拖挂房车可以由任意车辆牵引，上牌时上交当时牵引车的交强险即可，不一定非得是你自己车辆的交强险。",

          "description": "可能有很多朋友对拖挂很感兴趣，不过拖挂在我国还是一个小众的新事物，在2015年的时候，公安部才下发过《关于规范旅居挂车上路通行管理工作的通知》，要求保证拖挂房车上路的权利，也就是那时候各个地方基本没什么拖挂房车，以至于很多交警见了还以为是什么怪东西，扣下不给走。而直到今天，个别小城市还会碰到高速口不给拖挂房车上、交警盘查扣留拖挂房车的。\n今年4月1日起针对拖挂房车新增C6驾照的新闻大家应该也看到了，对拖挂房车感兴趣的朋友们应该也很想知道，C6驾照到底难不难考、自己已有的私家车能不能拉拖挂、相关法规又是怎么样的呢？\n先上结论：C6驾照对于有丰富驾驶经验的司机来说并不难；目前《道路交通法》对小型乘用车拉拖挂没有牵引资质的要求，任何小型乘用车（即微型车以外的家用车）都可以拉拖挂。\nC6驾照并不难考\n首先考C6驾照的要求是已经有C1或C2驾照一年以上，且年龄在20周岁以上、60周岁以下（通过测试后70周岁以下也可以），也就是没有驾照的人是不能直接考C6的，而对于有驾照、有驾驶经验的人来说，考C6并不难。\n\nC6的考试内容是桩考、弯道驾驶、直角转弯。\n桩考即倒车入库，分两次分别倒车入库到相邻的两个车位即可（从上图左边的H倒入右边的车位，再开到右边的H倒入左边的车位），车位中间是虚线且没有栏杆，前轮进入停止线前可以调整，不要求一次入库，熟悉一下车辆长度和宽度就行、并注意倒车要先反向打轮，是三个项目里最难的。\n\n弯道驾驶比较简单，考试用的挂车长度一般是4米，比市场上的主流拖挂房车要短很多，加上前车一般不到10米，注意内轮差就行。\n\n直角转弯应该是最简单的一项，路面宽度有5.7米，拖挂车的宽度是2米左右，练几次熟悉一下就可以了，没难度。\n考C6驾照最难的反而是报名，因为不是每个城市都能考C6，比如浙江目前就只有宁波和嘉兴能考，如果不在这两个地方还得把驾照先迁过去再报考，考完再迁回来，虽然交管APP上能操作，但也麻烦。价格方面每个地方的驾校也不一样，3800-9800的都有。\n什么车可以拉拖挂\n根据《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法实施条例》第56条，“小型载客汽车只允许牵引旅居挂车或者总质量700千克以下的挂车。挂车不得载人；”这里的旅居挂车指的就是拖挂房车，小型载客汽车指的是长度6米以内、载客人数9人以内的客车，但不包括微型汽车。也就是说大部分家用客车都可以拉拖挂，五菱宏光mini这种微型客车除外。\n​有一个常见的误解是前车必须要有牵引资质才可以拉拖挂房车，但实际上在《道路交通安全法》里是没有任何针对小型客车牵引旅居拖挂车牵引资质要求的，也就是任何家用车（微型车除外）都可以拉拖挂，不要求有牵引资质，虽然这和我们的常识及直觉相悖。\n\n \n不过在《国家标准 GB 7258-2017 机动车安全运行技术条件条文释义》4.16里有提到：“目前许多乘用车出厂前并未安装牵引装置，但为了牵引中置轴挂车而在出厂后加装牵引装置，这一做法违反了《道交法》。“但需要注意的是这个文件并不是法律条文，而是给汽车制造商、车管所看的，因此有部分车管所会依据这个解释，在拖挂房车上牌时明确要求前车要有牵引资质（如郑州），但在京沪等大部分城市是明确不需要的。对于明确需要前车有牵引资质才能上牌的城市，可以借一辆有牵引资质的车去给拖挂上牌或者去不要求牵引资质的车管所上牌即可。\n至于在上路之后，至少在目前交警也是不查前车牵引资质的，因为《道交法》并没有相关规定。可能有些地方的交警第一次遇到拖挂房车且不熟悉相关法规，会依据常识认为拉了拖挂前车当然要有牵引资质，这个时候和交警好好解释，交警再在对讲机里问问，都会放行的。\n造成这个现状也是和以前相关部门不重视机动车牵引资质有关，几乎只有少部分进口越野车才有牵引资质，国产车包括合资车想申请牵引资质都不知道在哪里申请，根本没有这个选项给你。当然近两年相关流程已经建立起来了。\n工信部在2022年4月25日就发了《关于规范具备牵引功能轻型汽车申报要求的通知》，要求有牵引能力的机动车应当申请牵引资质并做相关检测，然后在铭牌、公告、行驶证等地方体现出来。可以预见的是以后大概率会在《道交法》里新增拖挂房车前车牵引资质的要求，毕竟现在有很多小排量的小轿车在拉拖挂房车，存在道路安全隐患。",

          "description": "虽然在本文动笔之前高考还未结束，但在本文完成时高考应该已经结束多时，正是广大高中毕业生选择志愿的时候。所以，这篇文章的主要目的是提供有关物理学专业的专业选择指导。除此之外，如果你早已在其它行业功成名就，而又希望能领略如今物理学中人类的智慧光芒，那么本文也应能为你提供一些思路。本文作者为慕尼黑大学索末菲理论物理研究所在读博士，在物理学专业的学习和研究领域有丰富经验。本文将向大家介绍物理学专业的专业面貌、学习内容、就业去向及选择建议。\n什么是物理学？(认真)\n这是一个看起来很难回答的问题，因为它太 “大” 了 — 物理学是一个包罗万象、丰富多彩的学科，你似乎很难去用很简洁的话语把这些精彩纷呈的故事概括出来。但是我仍然要去讲这个问题。从我本人第一次认真接触前沿物理学算起到现在已经几乎十年了。这十年的经历给我的一个很深的感触之一，就是高中物理不是真正的物理。所以，对于只在中学阶段接触过物理学的许多读者来说，你们通过中学学习所获得的关于物理学的基本印象，与我从业将近十年所感受到的物理学有着几乎是云泥之别。所以，在作任何更细致的阐述之前，我希望能通过一些论述，向大家展示一下职业科研工作者眼中的物理学是何模样。\n如果你翻开高中物理学的教科书，你通常会在头几页的某个位置看到类似这样的一句话：物理学是研究物质运动、物质状态和物质间相互作用的一门学科。我不能说这句话是错的，只是它完全没能抓住物理学中最令人着迷的那些内涵。业内通常更喜欢著名期刊 Nature 官网上给物理学下的定义：\n\nPhysics is the search for and application of rules that can help us understand and predict the world. \n物理学寻找并应用一系列规律，这些规律帮助我们理解并预测这个世界。\n\n这句话虽然简单，但却精准描述了现代物理学…",

          "description": "这个问题是我最近做业务开发和业余开发都遇到的，这里的 angle 指的是旋转弧度。不是旋转角度。\n先看一下我使用 angle 的场景吧：\n\n\n\n图一中使用了 canvas.drawArc，传入了 startAngle 和 sweepAngle。图二也是如此。图三是 Flutter ConstraintLayout 中圆形定位的 example，我没有使用 Flutter ConstraintLayout 自带的旋转能力，而是用了 Transform.rotate，传入了 angle。Flutter ConstraintLayout 自带的对 Widget 的旋转能力用了 canvas.rotate，也传入了 angle。\n我现在还没搞明白弧度和角度的对应关系，官网文档中也没有详细说明。但对于我来说，我根本就不想去关心弧度是多少，我只关心角度，这个角度的范围是 [0.0, 360.0]。以图三中的时钟为例，旋转 0.0 或 360.0 度时，指针应该指向 12，旋转 90.0 度时，指针应该指向 3，旋转 180.0 度时，指针应该指向 6，旋转 270.0 度时，指针应该指向 9。\n于是我们需要将旋转弧度转换成旋转角度，我研究出的转换公式如下：\nTransform.rotate：\npi + pi * (angle / 180)\n\ncanvas.rotate：\nangle * pi / 180\n\ncanvas.drawArc：\nstartAngle = -pi / 2\nsweepAngle = angle * pi / 180\n\n看见没有，这三类旋转的转换公式都不一样。我不明白 Flutter 官方为什么要这么设计，为啥这么优秀的 Flutter 引入了这么糟糕的  API。于是我带着气愤给官方提了个 Issue，想喷一喷设计这几个 API 的哥们：\n\n结果我被反杀了。\n冷静下来之后，我决定提交一个 Pull Request 来修正这个 API。但这需要时间，因为提交 Pull Request 的周期很长，上次我提了个 bug，Oppo 的一个哥们修复了它，Pull Request 等了将近两个月才合并。\n好了，今天就讲这么多吧，你以后很可能会遇到需要旋转的场景，赶紧收藏起来吧！我是中国第一位 Android & Flutter 双料 GDFE，欢迎关注我的公众号 FlutterFirst，带你起飞！",

          "description": "Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nApple’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro M2 base model appears to have slower SSD speeds than its M1 predecessor. MacRumors reports that YouTubers Max Tech and Created Tech have both tested the 256GB base M2 model and discovered the SSD’s read speeds are around 50 precent slower than the M1 MacBook Pro with 256GB of storage. Write speeds are reportedly around 30 percent slower.\nTesting was completed using Blackmagic’s Disk Speed Test app, and Max Tech even disassembled the 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro and found that Apple is only using a single NAND flash storage chip. The M1 MacBook Pro uses two 128GB NAND chips, and multiple chips can enable faster SSD speeds in parallel.\n\n\nOther 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro models with larger SSD storage don’t appear to...\nContinue reading…",
