          "description": "Hello Dev folks, I'm Gaurav - a front-end focused software developer from India. Recently I came across a JavaScript problem that required me to find sum of all the numbers present in elements of a nested array.\nsum([1, 'x', '2x', ['3', ['x2', '5']]]);\nSo, you see a nested array with 2 levels of nesting being feed to a sum function.\nImmediately it comes to mind that if the array was flattened, the task would have been much easier. So, that's what we are gonna do now. Flatten the array. You can flatten any way you want it - \nUse flat method available on arrays.\nUse reduce and concat.\nUse a library such as lodash.\nUse a recursive function \nWhile using flat method on arrays is simplest to implement, I decided go with 4 and write a recursive method to flatten the array. It is fast and works fo…",

In this story I will explain briefly what the host header is, how vulnerabilities can arise, then give several examples. Finally, we will see how to protect against them.\nA Host header is a standard HTTP header field that is used to specify the domain name of the website that a user is trying to access. The Host header is used by the web server to determine which website to show the user. \nFor example, when a user types in www.example.com, the web server will look at the Host header to figure out which website to show the user. If the Host header is set to www.example.com, the web server will show the user the website that is associated with that domain name. \n…",

We love our terminal as it's our home base.\nSo whenever a new terminal pops up, I have to try it at least.\nI love and use iTerm2 for almost everything. But Warp is the new kid on the block, and although it comes with some downsides, it's pretty slick!\nTry our Warp here\nThis new terminal is made from scratch, not based on what we already know about terminals.\nThis, to me, is what makes it so cool. The whole terminal experience changes and makes it feel like a native app.\nIt's super quick to autocomplete and separate commands, so it's easy to understand which output belongs to which command.\nBesides these apparent wins, it's also super fast and comes with Intellisense for npm and git. You'll never forget a command this way.\n\nTo be honest, there are always downsides, aren't there.\nIt's only available for Mac, but the team seems to be working hard on a Windows and Linux version.\nIt's not open source, this might not be a bad hard point, but for some people, that's a deal-breaker.\nYou need to log in, which seems weird to use a terminal.\nI hope they are not using this personal data to keep track of our terminal usage, as it's now connected to a user profile.\nWorth a try if you're on Mac. It's pretty awesome to use.\nTry our Warp here\nThank you for reading my blog. Feel free to subscribe to my email newsletter and connect on Facebook or Twitter",

As a beginner I was making the same mistake again and again. But from the Free Code Camp's Youtube channel I found Per Harald Borgen's free beginner level full Javascript course. It was a interactive course on Scrimba.com.\nIt was important for me to practice online to boost my journey. I know you may ask their are many online code learning platform's then why Scrimba !!! then here are some answers why as newbie should learn JS from Scimba's Learn JavaScript for free !\n1. If you haven't a high end device:- For this course you only need a PC(1 GB Ram),Internet and a browser(Chrome suggested). Your journey will not stop due to lack of resources. You don't need to run several application to start.\n2.If you're a beginner:-I struggled hard to learn code by self ,in the way to my web development journey. I love to learn things by doing practical application in real world. This course will teach you Javascript by creating three projects like Passenger counter app, Blackjack game and a chrome extension.\n3.Fun and Zero distraction:- While learning from Youtube as a newbie I was so distracted by other recommended videos. In this course it was simple for me to stay focused. This course is amazingly delivered by Mr. Per . You will learn several things by doing challenges in this course.\nMy Suggestion to beginners:-After searching several platform's  I would suggest to learn Javascript from Scrimba. Don't waste so much time on watching random videos one after one to learn. It's a 7 hour long video and I assure you that you're  going to enjoy it.\nFor Mr. Per:- Hello sir ! thanks for your teaching. Your course impacted my life. It's my humble gratitude to you. Thanks a lot.\nI hope this review will help you to start journey in a productive way.\nIf you are reading this I will happy that we will stay connected.

          "description": "开源电子邮件客户端 Thunderbird 将通过 K-9 Mail Android 电子邮件应用项目登陆 Android，该项目与 Thunderbird 合并后的产品就是 Thunderbird Android 电子邮件应用。两年前，Thunderbird 被转移到了 Mozilla 基金会的子公司 MZLA Technologies Corporation 下，该公司的所有权结构与基金会子公司 Mozilla 公司旗下的 Firefox 类似。有了 OpenPGP 端到端加密和期待已久的移动应用等新功能，Thunderbird 项目能够开辟出一条自己的道路。\n\r\n根据 Thunderbird 团队的说法，Thunderbird 产品经理 Ryan Lee Sipes 和 K-9 的主要维护者 Christian Ketterer，两人早在 2018 年就开始讨论可能的 Thunderbird 电子邮件应用合作了。到了 2022 年，两人决定不再让 Thunderbird 从头开始​​开发自己的应用程序，而是直接让 K-9 加入 Thunderbird。\n\r\nThunderbird 团队表示：“许多 Thunderbird 用户都要求在移动设备上获得 Thunderbird 体验，我们打算通过把 K-9 打造成令人惊叹的产品（并将其变成 Android 上的 Thunderbird）来提供这种体验。K-9 将补充提供 Thunderbird 体验，并增强它的使用场景和方式，让用户获得出色的电子邮件体验。我们对桌面 Thunderbird 的承诺没有改变，我们团队中的大多数人都致力于将其打造为一流的电子邮件客户端，并将保持这种状态。”\n\r\n虽然 K-9 在 Google Play 上并不是特别受欢迎的电子邮件应用，但它已经获得了 500 万次下载。K-9 Mail 的路线图目前包括：使用 Thunderbird 帐户自动配置的帐户设置、改进的文件夹管理、消息过滤器支持，以及桌面和移动 Thunderbird 之间的同步。虽然 Thunderbird 知道人们对 iOS 版 Thunderbird 应用程序也很感兴趣，但在常见问题解答（FAQ）中，该项目仅声明它正在“评估”这种可能性。\n\r\nThunderbird 团队还打算将 Firefox Sync 作为一种在 Thunderbird 和 K-9 Mail 之间同步帐户的方法。它应该会在 2023 年夏天正式投入使用。该项目还在研究将哪些 Thunderbird 功能引入 Android 应用程序，例如日历、任务、提要和聊天支持等。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/06/thunderbird-the-open-source-email-client-is-coming-to-android/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Cloudflare 为客户免费阻击了有史以来最大的 HTTPS DDoS 攻击\n\r\n本次攻击峰值每秒发出 2600 万个请求，是有记录以来最大的 HTTPS DDoS 攻击。进行这次攻击的僵尸网络由来自 121 个国家的 5067 台设备组成，主要来自云服务提供商被劫持的虚拟机和服务器，而不是此前惯用的物联网设备。这次攻击是通过 HTTPS 进行的，目标是 Cloudflare 的一个免费套餐的客户。Cloudflare 表示，其免费和专业 CDN 套餐的所有客户都受到保护以免受类似的攻击而导致停机事故，不仅如此，这种保护是不计费和无限制的，所以无论攻击的规模或持续时间有多大多长，客户都不会被收取更多的服务费。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在 DDoS 愈演愈烈的今天，如果能有一个上不封顶的 DDoS 防护服务，那还有什么怕的？唯一一点不足的就是，在国内用起来比较慢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdobe 准备推出免费版的 Photoshop\n\r\n全面拥抱订阅模式的软件开发商 Adobe 准备推出免费版的 Photoshop，以吸引更多用户订阅它的服务。Adobe 正在加拿大测试免费版本，用户可通过免费的 Adobe 账号在 Web 上访问 Photoshop。免费版本提供了足够多的核心功能所需要的工具，Adobe 计划未来将部分工具只提供给付费用户使用。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这样看起来倒是不错，比必须花费高昂的买断或订阅费用要合理的多，而且这些免费用户也总有转换成收费用户的机会。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFirefox 默认启用 Cookie 全面保护功能\n\r\n该功能为你访问的每个网站创建一个单独的 “饼干罐”，嵌入网站的第三方内容在你的浏览器中存入的 Cookie，被限制在只分配给该网站的“饼干罐”内，从而防止追踪公司使用这些 Cookie 来追踪你在各个网站上的浏览情况。之前，该功能没有为所有用户默认打开。该功能使得 Firefox 成为最私密和安全的主要浏览器。Mozilla 表示，Firefox 的 “Cookie 全面保护”功能让“Chrome 和 Edge 望尘莫及”，它希望看到谷歌和微软效仿其做法，为用户提供更好的保护。苹果的 Safari 也有类似的反追踪功能，可以防止跨站追踪并隐藏用户的 IP 地址。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Mozilla\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这个功能其实我觉得比谷歌一次次推出各种所谓的保护隐私的追踪要好得多。",

          "description": "不想通过正确输入 验证码CAPTCHA 来证明自己是个人类吗？Cloudflare 可能有了一个解决方案。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n互联网服务巨头 Cloudflare  前两天 宣布了 私有访问令牌Private Access Tokens 功能。这项功能旨在减少你在网络上看到的验证码数量，同时改善你的隐私。\n\r\n你可能已经发现，验证码在移动设备上是一种可怕的体验。通常，它们会最终会占据整个屏幕，有时甚至无法完成。\n\r\n作为替代方案，网站可以选择收集唯一识别数据，以证明你是人类。当然，从隐私的角度来看，这种做法是很糟糕的。如果这么做，许多重视隐私的公司都几乎无法避免他们受到 僵尸攻击bot attacks。\n\r\n幸运的是，私有访问令牌（PAT）的发布将改变这一点。\n\r\n私有访问令牌会产生什么影响？\n\r\n简而言之，私有访问令牌能够做到下面这些事：\n\r\n\r\n在支持的设备上减少验证码数量\n\r\n增强用户隐私\n\r\n允许网站所有者确保访问者来自真实设备\n\r\n\r\n然而，深入观察，我们可以看到私有访问令牌的影响力远不止于此。若使用传统的验证码，就有多个实体可以访问你的数据。\n\r\n首先，你正在访问的网站知道你的 IP 地址和你正在访问的 URL。当然，这些数据是建立连接所需的最低要求。此外，对于更高级的功能，网站还会发送一些用户代理（UA）数据，还好这些数据并不是唯一可识别的。\n\r\n然而，另一方，也就是验证码提供者，却可以收集更多的数据。与你要访问的网站一样，它也知道你的 IP 地址、用户代理数据和你访问的 URL。不幸的是，除此之外，他们还会收集其他数据，例如你的设备信息和交互数据。如果把这些信息，与你之前完成验证码的时间联系起来，你就会惊讶的发现，他们可以建立一个非常详细的属于你的个人资料。\n\r\n幸运的是，有了 Cloudflare 的私有访问令牌，你就可以完全绕过验证码，从而阻止验证码提供者收集此类数据。\n\r\n私有访问令牌是如何工作的？\n\r\n\n\r\n验证码的理念是集中尽可能多的数据，私人访问令牌则恰恰相反，它将数据去中心化，因此任何一方都无法唯一识别你。在你提到数据共享之前，Cloudflare 就已经特别指出了，数据不会在各方之间共享。\n\r\n当你访问使用 Cloudflare 和私人访问令牌的网站的时候，共有三方将处理你的数据的不同部分。\n\r\n\r\n网站。它只会知道你的 IP、URL 和用户代理，这也是建立连接所必需的。\n\r\n你的设备制造商。他们只会知道那些用于验证设备是否真实所需的设备数据，而不会知道你正在访问哪个网站，或你的 IP 地址是什么。验证了你的设备后，他们将生成一个令牌，该令牌将发送到 Cloudflare。\n\r\nCloudflare。他们将收到这个令牌，令牌中不包含你的任何设备数据，只有制造商对它是正品的“保证”。他们知道的唯一其他数据，就是你正在访问的网站，同样，这是为你提供内容所必需的。\n\r\n\r\n通过这种方式，Cloudflare 无需接触你的数据，就可以对“你是一个人”充满信心。\n\r\n支持的操作系统：没有 Linux？\n\r\n你可能已经意识到，私人访问令牌需要特定的操作系统功能才能工作。目前，它们仅存在于苹果最新的操作系统上，即 iOS 和 iPadOS 16，以及 macOS Ventura。这是因为苹果的操作系统只在有限的硬件上运行，设备验证会更加容易。\n\r\n另一方面，Linux 是一种通用操作系统，旨在在各种硬件上运行。因此，我认为，在可预见的未来，它都不会支持私人访问令牌。\n\r\n回到苹果，我想到私人访问令牌也可能导致消费者维修设备的权利出现一些问题。例如，如果我用第三方的非正品电池更换了老旧的 iPhone 原装电池，私人访问令牌系统会特殊对待这种情况吗？\n\r\n如果是 Linux 手机呢？这些制造商，如 Pine64 和 Purism，可能没有支持这样一个系统的基础设施。是否可以在这些上使用私人访问令牌呢？\n\r\nCloudflare 在 公告 中提到：\n\r\n\r\n我们正在积极努力让其他客户和设备制造商也使用私人访问令牌框架。每当新客户开始使用它时，从该客户进入你网站的流量将自动开始要求令牌，你的访问者将自动看到更少的验证码。\n\r\n\r\n因此，我们希望看到它被更多的设备和操作系统采用。你如何看待 Cloudflare 的私人访问令牌呢？在下面的评论中发表你的看法吧！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/cloudflare-pat/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这个快速指南解释了恢复 Arch Linux 安装的一些方便步骤。\n\r\n\r\n作为一个滚动发布的版本，Arch Linux 中有时会出现一些问题。不是因为你自己的行为，而是数以百计的其他原因，如新内核与你的硬件或软件的兼容性。但是，Arch Linux 仍然很棒，它提供了最新的软件包和应用。\n\r\n但有时，它也会给你带来麻烦，你最终只能看到一个闪烁的光标，其他什么都没有。\n\r\n所以，在这种情况下，与其重新格式化或重新安装，不如在放弃希望之前尝试恢复安装和数据。本指南概述了这个方向的一些步骤。\n\r\n恢复 Arch Linux 安装\n\r\n第一步是用 Arch Linux 创建一个可启动的现场Live USB。从 这个链接 下载 .ISO 并创建一个可启动的 USB。你可以查看这个 如何使用 Etcher 创建可启动的 USB 的指南。记住这一步需要另一个稳定的工作系统，因为你目前的系统不能使用。\n\r\n你需要知道你的 Arch Linux 安装在哪个分区上。这是一个非常重要的步骤。如果你不知道，你可以用 GParted 来查找。或者在你的 GRUB 菜单中查看，或者你可以运行下面的命令来了解。这将列出你所有的磁盘分区及其大小、标签：\n\r\nsudo lsblk -o name,mountpoint,label,size,uuid\r\n\n\r\n完成后，插入 USB 盘并从它启动。你应该在现场介质中看到 Arch Linux 的提示符。\n\r\n现在，用下面的方法挂载 Arch Linux 分区。记得把 /dev/sda3 改成你对应的分区。\n\r\nmount /dev/sda3 /mnt\r\narch-chroot /mnt\r\n\n\r\narch-chroot 命令将在终端挂载你的 Arch Linux 分区，所以用你的 Arch 凭证登录。现在，在这个阶段，根据你的需要，你有以下选择。\n\r\n\r\n你可以通过 /home 文件夹来备份你的数据。如果，故障排除方式无效的话。你可以把文件复制到外部 USB 或其他分区。\n\r\n核查日志文件，特别是 pacman 日志。因为，不稳定的系统可能是由升级某些软件包引起的，如图形驱动或任何其他驱动。根据日志，如果你需要的话，可以降级任何特定的软件包。\n\r\n\r\n你可以使用下面的命令来查看 pacman 日志文件的最后 200 行，以找出任何失败的项目或依赖性删除。\n\r\ntail -n 200 /var/log/pacman.log | less\r\n\n\r\n上面的命令给出了你的 pacman.log 文件末尾的 200 行来验证。现在，仔细检查哪些软件包在你成功启动后被更新了。\n\r\n并记下软件包的名称和版本。你可以尝试逐一降级软件包，或者如果你认为某个特定的软件包产生了问题。使用 pacman -U 开关来降级。\n\r\npacman -U <package name>\r\n\n\r\n如果有的话，你可以在降级后运行以下命令来启动你的 Arch 系统。\n\r\nexec /sbin/init\r\n\n\r\n检查你的显示管理器的状态，是否有任何错误。有时，显示管理器会产生一个问题，无法与 X 服务器通信。例如，如果你正在使用 Lightdm，那么你可以通过以下方式检查它的状态。\n\r\nsystemctl status lightdm\r\n\n\r\n或者，可以通过下面的命令启动它，并检查出现了错误。\n\r\nlightdm --test-mode --debug\r\n\n\r\n下面是一个 Lightdm 失败的例子，它导致了一个不稳定的 Arch 系统。\n\r\n\n\r\n或者通过使用 startx 启动 X 服务器来检查。\n\r\nstartx\r\n\n\r\n根据我的经验，如果你在上述命令中看到错误，尝试安装另一个显示管理器并启用它，如 sddm。它可能会消除这个错误。\n\r\n根据你的系统状态，尝试上述步骤，并进行故障排除。对于特定于显示管理器 lightdm 的错误，我们有一个 指南，你可以看看。\n\r\n如果你使用的是 sddm，那么请查看 这些故障排除步骤。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n每个安装环境都是不同的。上述步骤可能对你不起作用。但它值得一试，根据经验，它是有效的。如果它起作用，那么，对你来说是好事。无论哪种方式，请在下面的评论区中告诉我结果如何。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2021/07/recover-arch-linux/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "OpenInfra 基金会的前身为 OpenStack 基金会，几年前它将范围扩展到其旗舰项目之外，于是改了名字。2022 年 6 月 7 日，它宣布了一种有趣的新方式，让企业资助基金会内的开源项目。一般来说，开源基金会的企业成员通过支付会员费来支持该组织，然后基金会按照他们认为合适的方式分发这些费用。OpenInfra 基金会现在推出了一种新的“定向资助”模式，允许成员将他们的资金直接用于项目。\n\r\n此前，基金会并不允许这样做，因为正如 Bryce 指出的那样，它可能会产生混合激励和付费游戏动态，而该组织一直试图避免这种情况。然而，社区对支持特定项目有很大的兴趣，这是有道理的，因为该基金会现在拥有更多种类的项目，但并不是每个成员都对每个项目进行了大量投入。\n\r\nBryce 表示，基金会的领导层和董事会，花费了大量时间来考虑，如何使基金会的核心原则与这种新模式相协调。因此，该模型试图将过去十年运行良好的 OpenStack/OpenInfra 技术治理模型的优点，与这些新的财务考虑相结合。\n\r\n在这种“定向资助”模式下，每个新项目都将拥有自己的法人实体来持有项目资金。为确保新项目的合法性，OpenInfra 白金会员（目前为 9 家，包括蚂蚁集团、华为、Meta、微软和红帽）必须担任项目的发起人，之后其他组织才能加入项目基金。如果赞助公司还不是 OpenInfra 成员，则必须成为成员。然后，所有这些资助成员组成一个项目基金管理委员会，决定创建预算的费用。与此同时，OpenInfra 基金会将为这些项目提供社区建设服务。\n\r\n这种新模式暂时只适用于加入基金会的新项目。Bryce 和 Collier 指出，组织可能会在一些现有项目中追溯应用这种新模式，但这个考虑目前不在路线图上。\n\r\n自从将范围扩展到 OpenStack 之外后，OpenInfra 基金会增加了一些新项目，例如用于提高容器安全性的 Kata Containers、用于基础设施生命周期管理的 Airship、Startling X 边缘计算堆栈以及 Zuul CI/CD 平台。\n\r\n“我们从每个成功的项目中学到的最重要的一点是，协作是关键，支持生态系统的范围越广越好，” OpenInfra 基金会总经理 Thierry Carrez 说，“事实上，我们发现最成功的开源项目是由多家公司资助的，因为他们能够整合资源以实现更高的回报率。”\n\r\n这种新模式显然是 OpenInfra 基金会引入新项目和新成员的一种方式。正如领导团队欣然承认的那样，其在多方生态系统中管理开源项目的模型 —— 无论是通过新的定向资金还是更传统的方法 —— 可能并不适合每个项目。即使 OpenInfra 基金会只收到一小部分项目，随着对这些复杂云基础设施项目需求的增长，开源项目的数量也在增加，同时它们也变得更加复杂。\n\r\n基金会还宣布了其各个项目的几个里程碑版本的发布，包括 Kata Containers 2.0 版、Zuul 5.0 版和 StarlingX 6.0 。\n\r\nCollier 说：“基金会今年庆祝成立 10 周年，在展望下一个十年的开放基础设施之际，我们正在推动我们的模型如此成功的关键，那就是：将希望合作的公司和个人联合起来，为他们提供一个框架和有效协作的工具，并帮助他们投资资金以最好地帮助他们关心的项目。”\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/06/openinfra-foundation-launches-directed-funding-to-support-open-source-projects/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "相信 AI 有生命的谷歌工程师被勒令休假\n\r\n谷歌的一位 AI 工程师 Blake Lemoine，从去年秋天开始与公司的聊天机器人 LaMDA 对话。LaMDA 运用了谷歌最先进的大型语言模型，使用从互联网上收集的数万亿词汇进行训练。在与 LaMDA 交流期间，他认为 AI 有了意识。比如他问 LaMDA 最害怕什么？LaMDA 回答说，它恐惧于被关闭。他继续追问：就像死亡？LaMDA 说：就像是死亡。因此，Blake 认为这证明 LaMDA 有了意识。在向上级展示了证据无果后他决定公开这件事，然后被公司勒令休假。在被封锁账号前，他给有 200 人的谷歌机器学习列表发帖说，“LaMDA 是有意识的，……是一个可爱的孩子，……我不在的时候请好好照顾它。”不独是 Blake，也有其它谷歌专家认为神经网络这种模仿人脑的架构，正在向意识迈进。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MSN\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不是工程师疯了，就是 AI 成精了 —— 国外的建国后允许成精。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n因硬盘故障，数十个 GitLab 开源项目开发受阻\n\r\nFreeDesktop.org 的 GitLab 服务承载着 Mesa、X.Org、Wayland，以及 LibreOffice 和 GStreamer 等开源项目。由于硬盘故障，FreeDesktop.org 的 GitLab 从 11 日某个时间开始一直处于关闭状态，并且没有恢复正常的预告时间。管理员们在努力恢复硬盘 RAID，但到目前为止没有结果。而且，两位管理员还宣布要休息一天。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然由于 Git 的特性，开源仓库内的数据基本上不会受到损害，但是这个事故其实暴露了很多开源项目在基础设施投入方面的不足。而且，我觉得国外的工程师们心里素质真好，无论如何该休息也是要休息的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开源软件公司 Odoo 估值 32 亿欧元\n\r\n总部位于比利时的 Odoo 公司成立于 2005 年，为全球中小企业提供一体化的商业软件，专注于开源的 ERP 和 CRM 软件。在不到一年前得到了 1.8 亿欧元投资，估值 20 亿欧元后，最近得到的 1.12 亿欧元使其估值进一步提高到 32 亿欧元。该公司计划在全球范围内开设六家新办事处并增聘约 1800 名员工。Odoo 目前有 700 多万用户在使用它的解决方案，预计今年的营业额约为 3 亿欧元，并少量盈利。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：tech.eu\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：开源技术公司越来越得到投资界的青睐，不过前提是属于头部。",

          "description": "6 月 13 日，阿里云智能总裁张建锋在峰会上正式发布 CIPU（Cloud infrastructure Processing Units），这是为新型云数据中心设计的专用处理器，未来将替代 CPU 成为云计算的管控和加速中心。\n\r\n在这个全新体系架构下，CIPU 向下对数据中心的计算、存储、网络资源快速云化并进行硬件加速，向上接入飞天云操作系统，将全球数百万台服务器连成一台超级计算机。 \n\r\n\n\r\n阿里云智能总裁张建锋发布 CIPU\n\r\n例如，CIPU 与计算结合，快速接入不同类型资源的服务器，带来算力的“0”损耗，以及硬件级安全的加固隔离；CIPU 与存储结合，对存算分离架构的块存储接入进行硬件加速，云盘存储 IOPS 最高可达 300 万，长尾时延降低 50%；CIPU 与网络结合，可对高带宽物理网络进行硬件加速，构建大规模弹性 RDMA 高性能网络，时延最低可达 5us。\n\r\n\n\r\nCIPU 架构示意图\n\r\n基于 CIPU 和飞天的新一代云计算架构体系，在通用计算、大数据、人工智能等核心场景的计算测试中展现了优越的性能。在通用分布式计算领域，Redis 性能提升了 68%、MySQL 提升了 60%，Nginx 提升了 30%；高吞吐类的互联网业务上云之后，比自建物理机的集群吞吐量提升了 30%，业务高峰期延迟下降了 90%；在大数据和AI等计算与数据双密集场景下，相比传统的 TCP 网络，弹性 RDMA 高性能网络的吞吐能力提升 30% 以上；云原生方面，容器启动速度快了 350%，在 Serverless 场景下 6 秒可拉起 3000 个弹性容器实例。\n\r\n\n\r\nCIPU 特性简介\n\r\n为什么要有 CIPU？张建锋认为，过去十多年，云计算技术经历了两个发展阶段：第一阶段是分布式和虚拟化技术替代了大型机，满足了当时企业所需的算力规模；第二阶段出现了资源池化技术，以阿里巴巴为例，通过计算存储分离架构，将计算、存储、网络资源分别池化，突破了规模和稳定性的瓶颈，提供了超大规模的云计算服务。\n\r\n但随着数据密集型计算场景的普及，用户对低时延、高带宽的需求也越来越高，传统以 CPU 为中心的计算体系架构无法适应这一趋势。为了解决这一问题，阿里云相关研发团队早在 2015 年就开始技术攻关，并于 2017 年推出业内首款虚拟化损耗为零的神龙云服务器。经过多年自研迭代，神龙、弹性 RDMA 等核心技术不断深入垂直整合，演进出以 CIPU 为中心的全新架构形态，云计算开始进入第三阶段。\n\r\n阿里云还不断夯实技术底座，建立了自研的芯片、服务器、飞天操作系统等软硬一体的基础设施。这些基础设施有力支撑了阿里云产品的四大核心：神龙计算、盘古存储、洛神网络和安全内核。在国际权威机构 Gartner 发布的年度报告里，阿里云获得计算、存储、网络、安全 4 项单项最高分以及 IaaS 整体基础设施能力的全球最高分。",

          "description": "Linux 发现一个“几乎不能被检测到”的寄生木马\n\r\n安全研究人员发现了一款名为 “Symbiote”（共生体）的恶意软件。他们称其“几乎不可能被检测到”。它会“寄生感染”系统，感染所有正在运行的进程，并为提供 Rootkit 功能、远程访问等。它最早在 2021 年 11 月被发现，似乎是针对金融部门特别开发的。它不是一个以感染机器的独立可执行文件的形式运行的，而是以一个共享对象库的形式加载到所有正在运行的进程中，并寄生感染机器。它采用了多种规避检测的手段，来隐藏文件、进程和网络流量，甚至能让 BPF 工具也无法发现其网络流量。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：黑莓\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实通过共享对象库寄生的木马并不稀奇，只是这个木马做了更多的隐藏手段，可见现在针对 Linux 的木马也越来越强大隐蔽了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 正在改进对低成本 RISC-V 主板 VisionFive 的支持\n\r\n最近 Ubuntu 开发人员一直在努力提高和改善对赛昉科技的 VisionFive 单板机的支持，有望在 Ubuntu 22.10 中看到对这种低于 180 美元的 RISC-V 计算机的良好支持。VisionFive 是为数不多的不超过 200 美元的、能运行完整 Linux 发行版的 RISC-V 主板之一。自 Linux 5.17 内核开始，就对 VisionFive v1 板提供了主线支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：目前这个板子还是比较缺货的，希望能在 Ubuntu 等发行版提供更好的支持时能解决供货问题。有对在这个板子上运行 Ubuntu 感兴趣的同学吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n推特联合创始人宣布 Web3 的竞争对手：Web5\n\r\n推特联合创始人 Jack Dorsey 认为 Web3 变得和之前的 Web2 一样有问题，对未来抗审查、注重隐私的互联网来说还只是个梦想。现在，他旗下的区块链公司 TBD 创造了一个新名词 Web5，将通过放弃以区块链为中心的方法来实现无审查、以身份为中心的网络体验，从而击败现有的模式。他们所宣称的技术可能和 BT、Tor 类似。目前这个所谓的 Web5 仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Coindesk\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：生造名词的技术“创新”，并没有什么意义，就像十多年前 Web2 刚刚初露头角时就有人宣称 Web3，但是到现在连 Web3 也并没有真正得到共识和认可。更别说所谓的 Web5，我就想知道，Web4 怎么了，是 4 不吉利么。此外，其视为典范的，无论是 BT 还是 Tor，都太过于激进了。",

          "description": "Linus Torvalds 发布了用来测试的 Linux 内核 5.19 RC1，带来了一些重大变化。\n\r\n\r\n继上个月 Linux 内核 5.18 发布之后，Linus Torvalds 宣布了 Linux 内核 5.19 系列第一个候选版本。与此同时，Linux 内核 5.19 官方合并窗口关闭，这意味着除非是关键性的，否则不会再接受任何新功能。\n\r\n简单看一下 Linux 内核 5.19 的新内容，会发现 CPU、GPU、网络、存储和核心模块都有常规的更新。此外，代码清理、淘汰过时硬件和对以后芯片组的持续支持是此版本的亮点。\n\r\n在进一步介绍之前，让我们简单来看一下这些新特性。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19（RC1）的新特性\n\r\nCPU\n\r\n首先需要提及的是，Linux 内核 5.19 开始 初步支持 龙芯架构的 CPU 系列。龙芯由中国龙芯中科公司设计开发。龙芯架构的 CPU 是兼容 MIPS 架构的通用微处理器。不过虽然现在提供了支持，但是你仍不能在龙芯 CPU 上启动 Linux，因为一些代码还在审核中。希望在 5.20 版本中能够使用。\n\r\n新的 英特尔 IFS 驱动 在该版本中落地，这有助于在部署前后发现硬件问题。它能够在早期阶段检测电路层面的 CPU 错误。\n\r\n在前几个针对英特尔 CPU 的内核版本中一直在对电源管理和散热方面进行开发，这个版本 也不例外。首先，为 Raptor 和 Alder Lake 家族添加了英特尔 运行时平均功率限制Run-Time Average Power Limiting（RAPL）的支持。其次，改进了 P-state 驱动以处理频率变化，并且基于 CPU 的缩放支持被添加到被动 devfreq 中。\n\r\n虽然英特尔 CPU 主要是散热和电源管理方面的工作，但对 AMD CPU 系列来说有更多的性能更新。首先，计划在今年年底完成 ZMD Zen 4 CPU 的 基于指令的采样Instruction-Based Sampling（IBS）模块引入了更多更新。此外，此版本引入了 PerfMonV2，提供了更多性能监视能力。\n\r\n此外，该版本中移除了 a.out 支持。同样，过时的 Renesas H8/300 CPU 也被移除了。\n\r\n主要 ARM 更新\n\r\n终于，主线 Linux 内核能够 支持 ARM 多平台 了。在 Linus 的 RC1 开场白中可以看到，这是该版本中的巨大改变！从 Linux 3.7 开始，跨越了十多年的工作，这是多么漫长的过程。\n\r\n\n\r\n图形和存储升级\n\r\n存储子系统在各种流行的文件系统中都有性能提升。最主要的变化包括苹果 M1 NVMe 控制器支持和对 XFS 文件系统的更好支持。此外，Btrfs、F2FS 以及 exFAT 文件系统也有增强。\n\r\n在代码行数方面，有一个令人兴奋的指标是仅是图形驱动程序 Linux 内核 5.19 就增加了大约50 万行代码。它包括 AMD 的 RDNA、CDNA，英特尔的 Raptor Lake、DG2/Alchemist 等图形驱动更新。\n\r\n重要的网络变化\n\r\n鉴于数据传输大幅增长，对 Big TCP 的支持有助于支持数据中心 400 GBit 级别的流量。它还可以在高性能网络环境中降低延迟。\n\r\n继续改进了 多路径 TCPMulti-Path TCP（MPTCP）。此外，高通 ath11k WiFi 驱动程序在此版本中添加了网络唤醒功能。同样增加了对瑞昱的 8852ce 芯片、联发科的 T700 调制解调器以及瑞萨科技的 RZ/V2M 的支持。\n\r\n其他值得注意的功能\n\r\n首先，内核中著名的随机函数生成器（RNG）在此版本中 继续 改进。\n\r\n其次，著名的新兴的 Framework 模块化笔记本电脑获得了此版本 Chrome OS EC 驱动支持。Framework 笔记本现在可以作为一个非 Chromebook 设备利用 ChromeOS 的嵌入式控制器。\n\r\n此外，Wacom 绘画板以及其他相关设备也有众多更新。包括 对联想 Thinkpad TrackPoint II、谷歌 Whiskers Touchpad、联想 X12 TrackPoint 等设备支持的提升。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19 下载\n\r\n如果你想要测试并尝试该候选版本，可以在 这里 下载。\n\r\n预计在 2022 年 7 月左右最终版本发布前，将会有多个版本更迭。\n\r\n参考自：内核邮件列表\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2022/06/linux-kernel-5-19-rc1/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：Donkey-Hao 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "GitHub 正式宣布终止 Atom 项目\n\r\nGitHub 是在 2011 年宣布 Atom，2015 年 5 月发布了 1.0 版本，并吸引了数百万开发者使用。而微软在 2015 年推出的 VS Code 也是受到了 Atom 的启发。在 2018 年微软收购 GitHub 后，Atom 成为了微软的项目。在社区对 Atom 前景的担忧之下，GitHub 承诺不会放弃 Atom。但过去几年 Atom 除了安全更新外几乎没有什么改进。而 Atom 和 VS Code 的用户数此消彼长，Stack Overflow 的 2021 年度开发者调查结果表明，仅 13% 开发者将 Atom 当做主力开发环境，而 VS Code 却高达 71%。最后，Atom 还留下了一个重要遗产，它所分拆出来的 Electron 框架被数以千计的应用广泛使用，其中包括 VS Code、Slack 和 GitHub Desktop 等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GitHub\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实可以想到，当年社区对 GitHub 被收购的担忧并非无的放矢。可惜了 Atom，至今我还对 Atom 1.0 那时候的那个 宣传视频 记忆尤深。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIETF 正式颁布 HTTP/3 推荐标准 RFC 9114\n\r\n作为超文本传输协议的第三个大版本，它确定了 QUIC 包含的 HTTP/2 功能，并描述了如何将 HTTP/2 扩展迁移至 HTTP/3。QUIC 全称为“快速 UDP 互联网连接”，由谷歌创建并于 2013 年发布。其旨在化解 TCP 需要多次来回握手，才能建立连接并开始传输数据的短板。早在 IETF 颁布 HTTP/3 的意见征求稿前，谷歌就已经将 QUIC 支持内嵌于 Chrome 浏览器，并在谷歌的诸多服务上启用。Web 流量观测表明 HTTP/3 的流量已超过 HTTP/1.1。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我记得 HTTP/2 也不过才几年，现在都要开始普及 HTTP/3。真是风水轮流转，谁想到最主要的互联网应用 HTTP 最终会从 TCP 转向 UDP 呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌再次打破圆周率计算纪录，计算出百万亿位\n\r\n早在 2019 年，谷歌云服务就已经打破了圆周率的计算纪录，计算出了 31.4 万亿位。周三，谷歌云再次宣布打破了百万亿位的圆周率计算纪录。这 百万亿位圆周率 的最后 10 位是：30952 95560。谷歌云表示，其借助计算引擎服务完成了本次新挑战，用到了 N2 机器家族、虚拟网卡、100 Gbps 网络带宽，以及平衡持久磁盘等新功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：谷歌\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看似无用的圆周率计算，其实是谷歌云一次炫技的展示。有人说，任何大小的数字都能在圆周率的某个片段找到。不说百万亿位了，你能背出多少位圆周率呢？",

          "description": "编译软件在你如何运行你的系统方面给你很大的灵活性。LD_LIBRARY_PATH 变量，以及 GCC 的 -L 和 -l 选项，是这种灵活性的组成部分。\n\r\n\r\n编译软件是开发者经常做的事情，在开源世界中，一些用户甚至选择自己动手。Linux 播客 Dann Washko 称源码为“通用包格式”，因为它包含了使一个应用在任何平台上运行所需的所有组件。当然，并不是所有的源码都是为所有的系统编写的，所以它只是在目标系统的子集内是“通用”的，但问题是，源码是非常灵活的。有了开源，你可以决定代码的编译和运行方式。\n\r\n当你在编译代码时，你通常要处理多个源文件。开发人员倾向于将不同的类或模块放在不同的文件中，这样它们可以被单独维护，甚至可能被不同的项目使用。但当你编译这些文件时，许多文件会被编译成一个可执行文件。\n\r\n这通常是通过创建共享库来完成的，然后从可执行文件中动态链接回它们。这样可以通过保持模块化功能的外部性来保持可执行文件的小型化，并确保库可以独立于使用它们的应用而被更新。\n\r\n在编译过程中定位一个共享对象\n\r\n当你 用 GCC 编译 时，你通常需要在你的工作站上安装一个库，以便 GCC 能够定位到它。默认情况下，GCC 假定库在系统库路径中，例如 /lib64 和 /usr/lib64。然而，如果你要链接到一个你自己的尚未安装的库，或者你需要链接到一个没有安装在标准位置的库，那么你必须帮助 GCC 找到这些文件。\n\r\n有两个选项对于在 GCC 中寻找库很重要：\n\r\n\r\n-L（大写字母 L）在 GCC 的搜索位置上增加一个额外的库路径。\n\r\n-l（小写字母 L）设置你要链接的库的名字。\n\r\n\r\n例如，假设你写了一个叫做 libexample.so 的库，并且你想在编译你的应用 demo.c 时使用它。首先，从 demo.c 创建一个对象文件：\n\r\n$ gcc -I ./in…",

          "description": "机器学习基本上是人工智能的一个子集，它使用以前存在的数据对新数据进行预测。\n\r\n\r\n当然，现在我们所有人都知道这个道理了！这篇文章展示了如何将 Python 中开发的机器学习模型作为 Java 代码的一部分来进行预测。\n\r\n\n\r\n本文假设你熟悉基本的开发技巧并理解机器学习。我们将从训练我们的模型开始，然后在 Python 中制作一个机器学习模型。\n\r\n我以一个洪水预测模型为例。首先，导入以下库：\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\n\r\n当我们成功地导入了这些库，我们就需要输入数据集，如下面的代码所示。为了预测洪水，我使用的是河流水位数据集。\n\r\nfrom google.colab import files\r\nuploaded = files.upload()\r\nfor fn in uploaded.keys(): \r\n    print('User uploaded file \"{name}\" with length {length} bytes'.format(name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))\r\n\n\r\n如果没有选择文件的话，选择上传的文件。\n\r\n只有在当前浏览器会话中执行了该单元格时，上传部件才可用。请重新运行此单元，上传文件 Hoppers Crossing-Hourly-River-Level.csv，大小 2207036 字节。\n\r\n完成后，我们就可以使用 sklearn 库来训练我们的模型。为此，我们首先需要导入该库和算法模型，如图 1 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\nregressor = LinearRegression()\r\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\n\r\n完成后，我们就训练好了我们的模型，现在可以进行预测了，如图 2 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Java 中使用 ML 模型\n\r\n我们现在需要做的是把 ML 模型转换成一个可以被 Java 程序使用的模型。有一个叫做 sklearn2pmml 的库可以帮助我们做到这一点：\n\r\n# Install the library\r\npip install sklearn2pmml\r\n\n\r\n库安装完毕后，我们就可以转换我们已经训练好的模型，如下图所示：\n\r\nsklearn2pmml(pipeline, ‘model.pmml’, with_repr = True)\r\n\n\r\n这就完成了！我们现在可以在我们的 Java 代码中使用生成的 model.pmml 文件来进行预测。请试一试吧！\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：Java 中有第三方库 jpmml/jpmml-evaluator，它能帮助你使用生成的 model.pmml 进行预测。）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/05/using-a-machine-learning-model-to-make-predictions/\n\r\n作者：Jishnu Saurav Mittapalli 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "《中国高血压防治指南（2018修订版）》中将有氧运动确定为高血压的防治手段之一，规律的有氧运动在降低血压方面的作用是显著的，长期规律的有氧运动能使高血压患者的收缩压降低12.3mmHg，舒张压降低6.1mmHg。相比于药物治疗，有氧运动的毒副作用小，且经济成本更低。\n\n有氧运动有代替药物治疗的可能吗？\n有氧运动能否代替药物治疗则主要取决于患者的血压水平，临床上将血压水平划分为5个等级（详见表 1），从有氧运动引起血压下降的幅度来看，血压处于正常高值范围内的患者从有氧运动中的获益最为明显，规律的有氧运动能够使其血压恢复为正常血压；1级高血压患者在保持良好生活习惯的基础上有可能通过单纯的有氧运动将血压降低至正常范围内；对于2级高血压患者来说，有氧运动则可以作为辅助治疗手段，通过规律的有氧运动可以达到减少服药剂量的目的；而3级高血压患者在有氧运动中通常会面临较高的运动风险，因此不建议在缺少医务监督的情况下单独进行有氧运动。\n表 1：血压水平分级\n什么样的有氧运动能够有效降低血压？\n运动引起的血压降低是有严格触发条件的，并不是“微微出汗”就能达到降低血压的目的。有氧运动由运动周期、运动频率、运动时间、运动强度等几个基本要素组成，持续8周以上、每周3次以上、每次持续20分钟以上的中等强度有氧运动是能够有效降低血压的最低运动标准，以上要素中的任何一个达不到要求都很难使血压降低。\n在以上的要素中，运动强度是影响降压效果最为关键，也是最难把控的一个要素，中等及以上的运动强度才能够引起血压的有效降低。运动强度常用最大心率的百分比来界定，如果有可以监测实时心率的手环或手表，在运动中心率达到最大心率的70%即可视为中等强度，最大心率可以通过“220-年龄”来估算。例如，一位30岁的青年人，他的最大心率约为220-30=190，190×70%≈133，当他在运动中的心率达到每分钟133次以上时即可…",

          "description": "这是一张我一直珍藏在手机里的照片，2017 年，少数派很荣幸的被邀请到美国现场参见 WWDC 大会，并参与了 Apple 设计奖的颁奖和报道，作为一个名不见经传的小媒体来说确实难得，也算是对我们前五年坚持推荐优质付费应用的一个小小认可。\n\n从这一年开始，一张图看懂 WWDC 就成了我们的招牌菜，用最简洁、最漂亮的设计，诠释大会关键信息，别小看这一张图，都是在半夜三点到六点之间做完的，通常都要两三个同事一起熬通宵，我虽然不参与设计，也会尽量陪着，做一些社交传播工作。\n也就是这一次，我才了解到苹果设计奖的一些标准关键词：Usability（易用性）、Design（设计）、Innovation （创新），Technology（技术应用）。而我们在 2014 年，就基于用户的角度，总结了少数派报道和推荐产品的四个标准关键词：「原创，优美，实用，有趣」，并把它们标注在网站的页脚。\n\n我没想到两个标准会有这么高的重合度，虽然看起来非常的巧合，但实际上，这是平台方希望保持「用户角度」的相同初心。这几个字说起来简单，但面对商业世界就非常的不容易。因为要坚持这样的推荐报道原则，我们放弃了很多广告投放的机会，商业化进展缓慢，终于在用完第一笔投资之后，进入严重的经营困难，不得不大幅收缩团队，转型拓展。而这个痛苦阶段，就在我们第一次受邀参加 WWDC 大会的一个月之后。\n现实就是如此，台前的辉煌不一定被看到，但幕后的痛苦你一个也躲不掉。\n\n从 2017 到 2019 年，少数派连续三次被邀请到美国现场报道 WWDC，随着经验丰富，我们也做了更多的准备。2019 年现场采访了很多开发者，录制了一些现场视频，那一年，我们刚刚建立视频内容小组，开始拓展一些新的形式。虽然拍摄和剪辑比较稚嫩，但内容还算是干货满满。\n随后两年，疫情来了，WWDC 也都改成了线上录播，虽然缺少了线下的仪式感，但我们还是保持着熬夜报道和制作一图流的习惯。对于我这个四十出头的中年人来说，熬一次夜还是挺伤身的，但这既是工作，也是爱好，痛并快乐着。\n近两年，随着智能手机销量的下降，国产品牌的追赶，WWDC 的关注度似乎也在减退，因为用户希望看到更多惊喜，而现实是硬件和应用创新都进入了瓶颈期。这次 WWDC 2022，苹果生态的价值开始被展现出来，四个大的 OS 都基本完善了，开始进行相互打通，比如 iPhone 和 Mac 电脑的相机协同，比如 macOS 的台前调度被整合到 iPadOS，还有深度调用车机信息的全新 CarPlay，这里不是简单的把设备捏在一块，而是基于用户的场景需求，提供最佳的组合方案，多年构建的生态壁垒又一次拉开了苹果与其他对手的距离。\n但回想一下，苹果这个生态是怎么来的呢？首先你不能跟风，而是要站在用户的角度，去做未来的布局；其次你不能贪婪，要放弃短期利益，去构建长期的用户信任；最后你不能偷懒，要保证每一个产品和服务的体验，不断累加产品力。除了这些基础的工作，还要应对开发者关系、投资者收益、供应链管理等一系列的考验，所以具有壁垒的生态不是喊出来的，是一步一步做出来的。\n\n一转眼，五年又过去了，很庆幸少数派还在，并且建立了基础的商业闭环，而苹果已经成为了全球最具价值的公司，我们也又一次参与了 WWDC 和苹果设计奖的采访报道。这五年里，很多外部事物都变了，但更多底层的东西并没有变。",

          "description": "为什么要这么做？\n昨天在推上看到一个视频，注意到他是使用 Sony ZV1 作为直播摄像头的。而作为一个视频制作者，我的不少视频都是以真人 + 教程的形式提供给我的观众的，我突然想起来，或许我可以使用手机来作为摄像头来完成视频的录制。\n和 MBP 自带的摄像头相比，可以让我在视频中更加清晰、更加明亮，让我的视频的观众们可以更好的看到我（没错，就是这么自恋）。于是，我决定用我的备用机 — Pixel 6 来完成这个操作。\n为什么是 Iriun Webcam\nIriun Webcam 的一个好处是免费版可以使用 4K，且免费版的水印也十分的不明显，对于白嫖用户十分友好。如果你需要完全去除水印或更加强大的控制能力，则可以付费获得。不过对于绝大多数场景，免费版足矣。\n所需软件\n\nmacOS 驱动下载：https://iriun.com/\nAndroid Play Store 应用：https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacksoftw.webcam\niOS App Store 应用：https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iriun-webcam-for-pc-and-mac/id1439303579?mt=8\n\n所需硬件\n\n与手机适配的 USB 数据线：如果本地网络速度足够快，也可以不使用数据线。不过我推荐你使用 USB 数据线，主要是理论上会更加的稳定。\n\n操作流程\n安装软件\nPC 端\n想要实现软件连接，需要先下载安装相应的软件。Iriun Webcam 支持 WIndows 、 macOS 和 Ubuntu ，你只需要访问其官网，并下载对应的软件，并在本地进行安装即可\n\n手机端\n手机端则可以在你的手机上搜索 Irirun webcam，并进行安装。\n\n配置设备连接\n安装完成后，在 macOS 上打开 Iriun Webcam 会看到如下的界面，此时说明你的 PC 已经准备好了。\n\n未连接状态的效果\n在手机上打开同样的软件，稍等片刻，二者就会自动连接到一起\n\n已连接状态的效果\n换用 USB 连接\n使用 Wi-Fi 连接的最大的问题是不稳定，以及延迟高。因此，你可以选择改用 USB 数据线进行连接，从而获得一个更低的延迟和更稳定的视频效果。\n你需要先将自己的手机开启开发者选项，并开启「USB 调试」，随后将手机与电脑连接（如果有授权窗口，则授权 PC 进行调试）。\n\n授权完成后，稍等片刻软件就会自动刷新，手机后的「Wi-Fi」变为「USB」，则说明你已经成功切换为使用 USB 连接。\n\n配置软件摄像头\n当你配置完成 Iriun 的 Webcam 之后，就可以在你日常使用的软件当中切换具体使用的摄像头为 Iriun Webcam 来获得从手机取得的视频画面。\n\n腾讯会议的摄像头选择框\n如果你使用 OBS 的话，还可以将音频输入修改为 Iriun Webcam audio （腾讯会议并不支持），来获取手机当中传递过来的音频信号。\n\n总结\n使用手机摄像头来替代 Mac Book Pro 上自带的摄像头可以帮助我们获得一个更好的画质和视频观看体验。相比于购买一个全新的摄像头，不妨用上你的旧手机来完成你的直播诉求。而你所需要的，不过是一款免费软件 + 一根 USB 数据线。",

Kindle 停止运行的重要时间节点\nKindle 对于我们的影响主要是在两个时间点：2023 年 6 月 23 日和 2024 年 6 月 40 日。\n\n在 2023 年的 6 月 23 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 商店当中购买我们喜欢的图书（还有一年时间缓冲）。\n在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 当中下载我们已经购买好的图书。\n在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日之后，我们只能通过 Kindle 数据线连接电脑的方式来下载图书到 Kindle 当中阅读。\n\n所以从短期来看，我们依然可以继续使用 Kindle 愉快的读书而没有丝毫的影响。但长期来看，如果你更喜欢线上随时选购的方案，那迁移到其他平台是必然的选择。\n2.

When I describe orchestration to someone, it usually sounds like I'm just describing automation. That's not quite right. In fact, I wrote a whole article differentiating automation and orchestration.\nAn easy way to think about it is that orchestration is just a form of automation. To understand how you can benefit from orchestration, it helps to understand what specifically it automates.\n\nMore on Kubernetes\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nFree online course: Containers, Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift technical over…\n…",

Today, the character is mostly known as a punchline for video game vaporware jokes, about how Duke Nukem Forever spent 14 years in development hell only to become a huge flop. \nAnd yet for years now, Duke’s corporate owners have been whispering that a movie is coming, culminating in The Hollywood Reporter’s story today: Legendary Entertainment has tapped Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg to actually produce a feature film.\nI don’t quite know how to react!

The game and its demo were already available for Stadia subscribers, but now anyone can try it out for free, provided they have a supported web browser and an internet connection faster than 10 megabits a second. You don’t even need a Google account; you just navigate to the website, enter your birthday (the game’s rated M), and click the play button.\nAs for how the demo looks... you certainly get what you pay for with the browser version.

          "description": "Jeremy Mayer challenges the notion that typewriters’ creative output is confined to the written word. The artist scours shops and trash bins near his Bay Area studio for analog processors in disrepair that he then disassembles, sorts, and reconstructs into metallic sculptures. His previous works include symmetrical assemblages, anatomical recreations, and an ongoing series of birds, the most recent of which are shown here. Mayer builds every piece solely from original parts rather than soldering or gluing, and some sculptures, including the black crow with a Corona-brand typewriter logo on its back, feature spring-like components that allow the creatures to bob their heads.

Through slicing, weaving, and gluing, the daily publications find new meaning and relevance as the artist overlays their pages with intricate lace patterns. These precise motifs obscure much of the text, leaving only a prominent headline or single image entirely visible. More",

Whether a descendent of the first specimens that appeared approximately 400 million years ago or a modern hybrid cultivated to increase food production, the generative forms are often visually striking in their own right with otherworldly colors, textures, and shapes.\nPhotographer Thierry Ardouin showcases these marvelous, strange qualities through hundreds of striking macro shots now compiled in a forthcoming book and exhibition.

Using countless layers of thread and the occasional felt base, the artist stitches curly kale, collard greens, and other fare that bear a striking likeness to their real-life counterparts: dense tufts in green form broccoli florets, a broad bean pod splits open to reveal a soft downy inside, and tight rows line the undulating surface of a sweet potato.

To share light and love and to look at the world as vibrant and colourful as it can be….It’s reflected in my textiles, to uplift narratives often tethered to dark undertones, with the gift of bright hues.\n More",
