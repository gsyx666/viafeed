Excited to code on the job, and worried that they'd fire me when they found out that I didn't actually know how to code. \nI had just written my first lines of JavaScript a couple months ago, and the knowledge gaps I had seemed infinite. It felt strange to call myself an Engineer when others who started with me clearly knew so much more than me. \nAt first, I attributed these self-doubts and feelings of insecurity to my career change. After all, people's professions often form an important part of their identity, and mine had just changed completely.

I love that you can add attendees and other properties. But the tablet app is painful to use with a stylus. And because it's so structured, I'm less likely to add notes that don't fit in a predefined section.\nSamsung Notes. For daily tasks and reminders. This replaced the Cambridge Quad notebooks I used to buy in bulk. I bought a Samsung tablet, and now I'm stuck. The handwriting recognition is the best of multiple apps I've tried. Unfortunately the people at Samsung make it impossible to access and edit your notes on desktop or the web.\nOneNote. Which I've been trying to use because it's there and easy to save random screenshots to. But the lack of basic editing features and plugins sucks. The forced notebook and page structure is also pretty limiting. I hate clicking around to find notes and the view easily feels cluttered.\nRandom sticky notes. For random thoughts, customer service case numbers, git commands to refer back to, etc.\nI would love to use one app that does everything these 4 apps do:\nOrganize my notes into groups and structures that I can easily search and get back to\nBe workable on tablet. I'm not asking for much here. Just let me take notes. Recognize my handwriting and let me edit on desktop or the web.\nSimple interface that doesn't inhibit random notes or reminders I want to jot down.\nSomeone suggested Obsidian. Never used it before, but would love to get some feedback from those who have. If there's another app that you swear, please let me know!\nPhoto by Polina Tankilevitch from Pexels",

          "description": "It’s been a year since I graduated from my Bootcamp and about 8 months of working at CodeCast. While I’m still a junior developer through and through, I’ve started to get more comfortable with where I am at. Looking back I can see a lot of things I wish I had done differently, which is great, to be honest. Being able to recognize that I’ve changed and grown as a developer is fantastic. \nI previously wrote a post about some of the common mistakes that junior developers make. Since then, I’ve come up with a new list of mistakes I see myself and others making, so I thought it was the perfect time to write a second part. Without further ado, let’s get into it!\nWhen you start developing, it’s very easy to just assign super quick names to things like functions and variables so you can focus your…",

I come across them every once in a while on social media.\nThese sorts of divisive claims bring about nothing but toxicity to our community, and only alienate the junior developers who are new to it. Especially for the profit of some traffic on Twitter or elsewhere, it's despicable.\nThey paint a completely wrong image of the web dev scene, too - being a web developer is much more about the perpetual process of self-improving, learning new tools & technologies and experimenting with methods to combine them in the best way, rather than knowing some constant list of terms (which are often occasionally useful at best).

          "description": "Lately, I've been tending to lean more towards employing a monolithic approach in system architecture. On paper, using micro-services seems like an ideal solution. The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I've watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.\nI'm not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn't really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.\nSo my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?",

Product demonstrations, property tours, tutorials, and keynotes all make great content—provided that they’re readily searchable by your team and visitors alike. Even though tagging and categorization help organize videos and make them easy to find, the labeling process is labor intensive, taking time away from key tasks like creating new videos.\nThe solution? Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content. Video tagging extends image classification to image sequences, capable of detecting types of scenes (cities, mountains, the seaside) and objects (people, cars), and even inferring whether the content is appropriate for public viewing.

An excellent solution for animations is react-spring, but I'd consider it an overkill for a basic CSS powered open/close transition (but it's great for animations in something like an image viewer).\nThis is why I’ve ended up writing my own hook: react-css-transition-hook\nIt is used like this:\nconst { isOpen } = useMenu();\nconst [isVisible, props] = useTransition(isOpen, {\n  entering: \"transition ease-out duration-100 transform opacity-0 scale-95\",\n  entered: \"transition ease-out duration-100 transform opacity-100 scale-100\",\n  exiting: \"transitio…",

Truth be told, there are several issues that can spring up from an unorganized, unprincipled global state.\nAs a basic example, the global state may contain a response payload from an API request, and it may contain some UI state about whether certain components are visible. These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.\nWhen these distinctions aren't made, you can run into trouble. For example, if you create a top-level property for every screen/experience, you can duplicate the storage of the API responses that support those experiences:\nconst s…",

I get the following error on the commented line above.\nProperty 'config' of type 'ConfigType' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'string'.\nThe issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.\nI've seen something like the following ...\nexport interface Person {\n  id: number;\n  firstname: string;\n  lastname: string;\n  [key: string]: string | number;\n}\n\n... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.\nI came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.\nThis approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport type DataModel = {\n  config: ConfigType;\n} & {\n  [key: string]: string;\n};\n\nThe following code is another resolution.\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport interface DataModel {\n  config: ConfigType;\n  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;\n}\n\nThis approach has the \"issue\" that a new \"key\" could be used with another ConfigType.\nAs I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.\nIf anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.",

          "description": "If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.\nDisplaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.\nIn this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.\nThe procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.\nThe first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.\nWhen you move it, you can paste this code for the script:\nGIT=`xcrun -find git`\nGIT_REV=`${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD`\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}\" \"${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}\"\n\nIn the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.\nNow, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.\nTo display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:\nlet revision = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: \"REVISION\") as? String \n\nIn Objective-C we would do it like this:\nNSString *revision = [NSBundle.mainBundle objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@\"REVISION\"];",

I think I now found my purpose for the next few months: I want to re-write typescript documentation in a way that is actually understandable by a casual reader 😊\nLet's start with one of the pain points many developers are struggling with: generics!

This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.\nVanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.\nJS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.\nJavaScript can be used for the following:\n Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.\n Creating web and mobile applications.\n Building web servers and developing server applications.\n Game Development\nTypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.\n TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.\n TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.\n JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.\n TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn't need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.\n\nThe benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:\n Supports Class and Modules.\n Static Type-checking\n ES6 Feature Support\n Clear Library API definition.\n Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.\n Superset of JavaScript\n\nAs TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.",

          "description": "For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.\nAvailable in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:\nconst { randomUUID } = require(\"crypto\");\nrandomUUID(); // \"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\nIt's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!\nYou can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.",

Let's dig into this answer a bit more though starting at the basics and including a few visual examples. \nForm elements are rendered with HTML within React components where data is being accessed and manipulate. When we are discussing uncontrolled and controlled components these are terms that are specifically discussing the way in which the form created is handling and accessing that said data.

But learning AWS is made more challenging when you're also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. \nIn simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. \nStacks can be stood up manually. However, it's better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…",

I have too, and that's why on more than one occasion I've wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.\nOkay! to start with this:\nHTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it \"programming language\" should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a \"markup language\" because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.\nAs I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :\n<tag>content</tag>\n\nHowever this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :\n<img>\n\nBut that's not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like \"upgrades\" of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.\n<tag attribute=\"value\">content</tag>.\n\nIt seems interesting, doesn't it?

          "description": "Let me describe my coding journey to build a Social Proof component from Frontend Mentors. Frontend Mentors is a online platform that provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs.\nThe goal is to build this:\n\nThe first coding hurdle was setting up the HTML & CSS to create the initial layout and then testing if it flowed decently between mobile and desktop as intended. \nMy first decision was deciding between CSS Grid, Flexbox, or a combination of the two. Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool\nMy tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas. \nGIF of responsive layout\n\nScreen-shot of the Layout\n\nThe next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.\nScreen shot of app in development, no styling\n\nNow for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. \nThe one thing I didn't know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time. \nScreenshot of CSS code for setting multiple background images\n\n\nYou can play with the solution here\nI learned how to add multiple background images at one time. \nI was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: \nDesign a responsive layout\nBuild a foundation with HTML\nAdd content\nStyle with CSS, section by section\nEnd with functionality (JavaScript & CSS animation/transitions)\nThis \"Ground up\" methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra \"Slow is Fast\".   \nTips on Background Images  by CSS Tricks\nThank you for reading my blog. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nYou can find the completed code here",

          "description": "Mensah Alkebu-Lan\nPrerequisites\nDiscussion\nReferences\nSome familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.\nArrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.\nThe Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.\nBelow is a typical example of how the filter function is used:\nvar arr1 = [1,2,3,4],\n    arr2 = [2,4],\n    res = arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item));\n\nconsole.log(res);\n\nWhen this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array. \n Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter.

After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.\nA quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties' blogs about anything open-source. \nFor my task, I had to customize Telescope's build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:\nAdd header and side navigation bar\nChange side navigation default logo into Telescope logo\nUpdate link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Working on the issue\n\n\nAfter setting up the development environment using Telescope's documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.\nI began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn't break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. \nSince I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn't break or miss anything.\nSimilar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.\nCheers! 🍻",

I then had to prepare for a couple meetings I had today. Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.\nAt the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.\nI will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.\nI also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week's worth of changes. \nA little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I'm not too upset about it. \nA clean slate, a new approach!\nI am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it's really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. \nComplicated state management between components.

          "description": "As Docker usage has grown, Docker Compose has become the leader in running multi-service applications locally. Unfortunately, as your application expands and more services must communicate, we’ve found authoring these Compose files can become arduous, time consuming, and mistake prone. We want to make writing Compose files with volumes, ports, and multiple services much easier. \nToday, we’d like to announce the Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code. That’s right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense, Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: \nIntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)\n\nTooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image)\n\nRight-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) \nYAML Syntax Validation \nHyperlinks for Docker Images \nIn our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!\nThere are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:\nMore tab completions\nDocker Compose schema validation \n… and much more! \nWe love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.",

I'm in the midst of the Ruby Path at The Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I've been working on building a game of Mastermind, which is easily the most complicated thing I've had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I'll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 \nSince this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I'm visiting my family back home.

While the linting itself was not a problem, I ran into some serious dependency tree errors and really got lost in the forest of it. Solving these errors was a really long winded process and it ate up a lot of the time I had set aside for working.

My plans are to continue with FreeCodeCamp's tutorials and any spare time I get to work on my project will be a blessing.\nDealing with dependencies in React.

Previously, during Hacktoberfest I contributed to a tool called toad-scheduler which is an in-memory NodeJS scheduling tool.\nIn this tool, I helped fix a bug about setInterval() limit throwing an error with anything over than 24.5 days. During this PR, I had to write a test using Jest framework to handle the long intervals and make sure it was firing the task correctly.\nFor my next PR, I wanted to work on the tool again with Igor Savin. I asked him what I could do to help this time around.

          "description": "今年的十一假期期间我没有继续宅在家里，而是选择打破两点一线的工作日生活，去探寻不一样的城市和自然美景——当然除了感受异地的人文风景之外，我还有另外一个目的：作为「村长」，为了更好地建设村落而积累更多的「步数」。\n这或许是我第一次因为一款游戏而「运动」。\n\n一个用「步数」建成的「猫猫村」\n比起那些需要不断氪金或者让你看广告的手游，我更喜欢《猫猫村》这种「无负担」的「健康手游」——没有虚拟世界里的激烈竞争，也没有让我沉迷到不可自拔的关卡，整个游戏玩下来的感觉只有一个：原来只要健康生活就可以满足你所建设的这个《猫猫村》中村民们的需求，让这些可爱的「像素猫」可以开心愉悦地生活。\n\n而如何建设你的猫猫村？答案就在自己脚下——尽力地在现实世界中坚持运动来获得步数，就可以用来在游戏中建设房屋、道具、家具等，并以此让猫猫村中村民生活得更惬意，而村民们如果对当前的生活感到满意就会产生「爱心」：这同样也是一种重要的建设资源，随着爱心获取越多，你可以一步步地解锁更高级的建筑以及道具，从而让你的村落设施更全面，进一步地扩大村落吸引更多的村民入住。\n\n我不知道这样以运动步数作为游戏中重要资源的设计是否更符合现代年轻人的「佛系生活方式」，但不得不说《猫猫村》让我们每天的步数有了更多的使用场景，使得每天的运动可能不再仅仅是蚂蚁森林中新增的绿地、微信运动中每日的步数排行榜，或者是 Apple Watch 获得的运动成就徽章……\n\n这款游戏为那些看似日常的运动赋予了一种新的使命感——让自己的努力为游戏中的「他们」带来美好的生活，这又何不是另一种类型的自我心灵疗愈？\n像素画风下的温馨小村\n不仅仅是游戏要素，从画面上《猫猫村》就完全有别于我玩过的任何一款游戏，甚至你可能会觉得它无论在画面上还是设置方面都显得有些「简陋」——八位像素风格的画面，整个场景设计成了横板卷轴，因而整个村落的建设完全是在一个 2D 的平面中进行铺设，甚至在建设玩法上实际更像是在一个线上依次摆设——既不能调整建筑的大小，也不能调整建筑或者家具的位置。\n\n当然对于喜欢像素风游戏的朋友而言，《猫猫村》又是很独特的，类似早年八位机游戏的文本互动方式在现在看来，显得是那么地复古与时尚。\n\n这种画面上的简单让你不由得会想到早年的像素风游戏甚至是那些横板过关的游戏——因此游戏的发展进行或者是场景的解锁都是向两侧进行，比如你可以根据猫猫村民 NPC的提示来扩展村落边界，或者是通过建设不同的建筑来创建更多的子场景，而这些分散的子场景让游戏随着时间推进一步步地变得更加丰富有趣。\n\n每天就玩十分钟：真的不能再多了！\n如果你每天都抽出时间玩上一会儿《猫猫村》，你可能会觉得他是你见过的最「佛系」、最不会让人上瘾的游戏了。\n\n游戏中的玩法其实非常简单，你需要带领一群像素猫猫建立一个自己的村庄，而最初的生产资料就是你每日的步数，我们需要使用步数来兑换最为基础的建筑，比如水井、树等等，通过和猫猫们的共同努力来建设村落中的第一栋房屋。\n\n随着游戏的进行，猫猫们在村落生活的同时开始产生大量的「❤️」，同样作为生产资料，你可以使用「❤️」来安装抵御偷心贼的武器，也可以用来兑换一系列的新建筑，而猫猫 NPC 也会随着时间推移给出相应的建设请求，并一步步地提醒你建设新的建筑与设施。\n\n当你真正上手之后就会发现，实际上整个《猫猫村》的节奏并不快，相比那些几个小时就开始提醒你继续建设的放置类手游，《猫猫村》的平均游玩时间可以说非常短，而我每一次的游戏时间也在十几分钟左右，在完成 NPC 给的小任务之后往往更多的是点触村民猫猫来进行互动。\n\n随着游戏的进行，你可以建造的建筑以及家具就会又来越多，这些建筑物或者家具其实也暗藏玄机，比如你可以使用幸运转盘进行抽奖，甚至你可以通过将记事板放到房间里，并使用密码锁给房间上锁，在猫猫村中撰写你的「私密日记」。\n\n结语\n在上手《猫猫村》之后，我带上村民回到了自己生活的城市，回到了那些用钢铁水泥构筑的森林和那封闭的格子间，好在手机的那一头还有一些用像素构成的小猫在等着我，等着我在疲累的工作之余，和他们简单地来一次互相治愈的游戏。\n\n送码\n你可以在 App Store 免费下载《猫猫村》并游玩前期故事剧情，完整剧情可以通过解锁内购进行获取，售价 25 元。\n在评论区说说你对《猫猫村》的体验、想法和建议，下周一 (11.29) 选 2 位读者赠送《猫猫村》完整剧情内购兑换码。\n \n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "大家好，我是《秦时明月》的执行制片人薛小明。首先还是对各位喜欢《秦时明月》的秦迷朋友表示感谢。《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》十五周年版，已经播出第三集，相信大家都看到了一段精彩的打戏，不知道看得过瘾不过瘾。相信大家从中也能看出，我们在这个版本上花费的心血。\n\n对于这部作品的意义，正如沈导之前回答提过，这次的十五周年版是在《秦时明月》播出十五周年之际，答谢秦迷和观众朋友的一份回馈。为了更好的效果，这次《新秦时明月》的制作也有很多不易，除了用我们最新的技术提升了画面的质感和各方面的细节之外，我们还进一步提高了打戏的观感。对一部武侠作品来说，打戏毫无疑问是至关重要的。而与注重特效的影视作品不同，《秦时明月》一直是那种“拳拳到肉”的写实武学实践者，相信看完第3集的观众就更能够感受到这种风格。\n\n这一集的打戏占比是比较高的，从前面无双与项家子弟的切磋，中间少羽和无双单挑，到最后危急关头盖聂的一剑救场，可以说既还原了我们第一部的经典剧情，又增加了很多亮点。在武戏上，我们着重表现人物的特色以及更真实的打击感、紧迫感。为此，我们加快了打戏的节奏并尽可能的展现出角色见招拆招的设计，比如少羽和无双的这段打戏，无双的特点是力量强又有着钢筋铁骨，一旦被他抓住就很难脱身反击，所以少羽更多是依靠身法的灵活躲闪去进攻他的薄弱部位。且不管是无双还是少羽，所做出来的很多组合动作以及运镜都是经过不断地调整，同时是连续镜头，这样可以看出人物的连贯动作。\n\n为了这些效果，我们的武戏部会与我们的动捕演员深入交流，所以武戏这方面，我们确实是花了很多力气去做。我想这也是秦时明月传统武学的魅力之一。\n在正片的最后，大家可能注意到这是一段在旧版《秦时明月》中没有出现过的镜头，即盖聂找到天明并保护他的这段回忆。这段回忆是我们对剧情细节的一个补充，也是为了让盖聂这个角色更立体。相信通过这些细节的补充，可以让观众对盖聂为什么会叛离秦王宫的原因有了更多自己的理解。\n\n这一集中主要涉及到的点就是以上这些，后续的剧集中还会有更多精彩丰富的内容呈现，希望大家能够多多支持我们。在此也感谢粉丝和观众为我们提出的建议，之后我们一定会继续努力，为大家带来更好的作品。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n薛小明\n点击下载\n12 个回答，查看全部。\n斗罗大陆动画播放量为何远超其他大IP？\n我和朋友争论日漫和国漫到底谁制作经费更高，是不是一集3d斗破苍穹水准比一集一拳，紫罗兰烧钱？",

          "description": "回答此问题前，我们可以先看看，其他传统形式是呈现科幻题材的好载体么？\n郭帆的影视团队对中国科幻的工业化影视改编做了拓荒性质的探索，团队选取了刘慈欣《流浪地球》这篇2.2万字中篇的其中一段进行了改编。从电影工业化来看，它的置景、服化道和特效真正做到了对叙事的辅助和增强（甚至还在半途成立了UI部门来解决呈现问题），他们的努力使得电影的世界可信、幻想合理，作为当代科幻电影可以说是合格了，但不少观众会批判其人物和剧情过于套路，而另一些观众则认为其格局过小、背离原著精神。\n《爱，死亡与机器人》是以动画短篇形式对科幻呈现的探索，第一季18集中的16集背后都有科幻小说原著支撑，包括广受好评的《齐马蓝》。不少观众喜欢其恢弘浪漫的视觉表达和返璞归真的禅意，但原著中作者阿拉斯泰尔·雷诺兹还有一层探讨，是关于记忆的载体，由肉体记录的不稳定记忆和由机器记录的精确记忆，究竟哪一个才是人之为人的关键。有些科幻读者与学者惋惜于这部分探讨被完全抹去，但也有影评人认为这一取舍令此作品封神。\n对于最近刚刚上映的《沙丘》意见分化更是严重，路人观众对于一群掌握空间旅行技术的人用冷兵器打群架十分困惑，认为其节奏缓慢、剧情拖沓。但也不乏喜欢其美术风格者，和包括我在内的对其精准还原了原著风貌与精神的科幻爱好者。\n而最近火热的“元宇宙”概念，最早来自尼尔·史蒂文森的《雪崩》，这一科幻概念的落地已不再局限于单一载体，而是涵盖了多样载体与技术的现实社会。当然，有人认为这是人类发展的未来，也有人认为这个概念被过度解读，变成了什么都能装的口袋概念。\n除此之外，《诗云》的广播剧、《三体》的舞台剧、《闭环》改编的剧本杀《星落五丈原》、综艺节目《火星情报局》等，都是对科幻题材落地形式的探索，但孰优孰劣，相信每一个欣赏体验过的人都有不同的看法。\n \n\n\n对于游戏载体，这些问题也同样存在。\n2018年火到出圈的游戏《底特律：变人》通过其游…",

          "description": "很多年前我在知乎给过一个论述，今天再稍微做一次复读机：\n工业水平决定爆款上限\n受众特质决定爆款呈现\n囿于写这个论述的时候，我对于游戏产业的工业化其实理解是有一定偏差的。所以今天我对这个论述稍微修正一下：\n在创意行业中，工业水准决定表达形态。\n当然还是要说明，我自己并非游戏开发，本职工作现在更接近发行；很多涉及开发本身的事情我的回答会显得班门弄斧，请大家多多指正。\n-\n如何定义工业化？\n我的定义就是在项目上建立高效的自动化系统，拥有成熟的开发技术栈，优化的开发工具，并利用成熟的系统高效地生产游戏内容。\n工业化其实更多是生产方式的区别，重点在于效率的提升，而并非是产出的游戏本身的大区别。——在这个意义上来说，某些大作其实并非工业化生产，或者最多是纺织工人用上了珍妮纺织机，但离真正意义上的工业化生产，还有很多距离。\n回归到问题“如何看待工业化对游戏产业发展的重要意义？“本身，在这个回答中，我想谈三个事情。\n其一，是产能的提升。\n产能其实是两个维度，第一是能做什么，第二是同样的时间能做多少。\n实际上是存在一个反-工业化的叙事的。那就是“小作坊”生产。而大家都在鼓吹工业化生产，或者至少认为工业化生产是一个好东西的时候，我们面临的现状是大多数的游戏开发都以小作坊式生产为主。\n这个倒不是说大家条件艰苦云云，而是说开发模式还是以堆人力，怼资源的模式为主。\n在这种情况下，决定产品上下限的，都是团队整体每一个人的能力。在这种情况下来说，人员的稳定性和能力水平就非常致命。\n同时，团队能力的下限也在非常大的程度上决定了你能做什么样的东西。\n而开发的工业化在一定程度上是能够解决这个问题的，成熟的开发管线可以让内容的生产效率更高，也让内容生产更不依赖于某个/些特定人才。\n这点在于游戏产品质量需求提升明显的今天，是尤其重要的：尽快完成开发工业化的厂商/工作室，一方面能够更快的追随市场的喜好，生产表现力更强的游戏产品；另一方面则显然能够有更大的腾挪空间，对市场的适应性更高。\n其二，是管理模式的改变。\n工业化的生产，势必引领更工业化的管理模式。这点在逻辑上还是很明显的。产能提升其实能够显著避免micro-management。项目管理的重要性也越来越多。\n倒不是说某一种或者某几种项目管理模式就一定行。但以往关键角色一言堂的情况，在更高的产能下，其实会有一定的衰减——因为在高产能的环境下，leverage资源比对项目直接bb要更紧迫。\n囿于我本身并非管理者，所以我对于这点的诠释并不全面。但我能够清楚且欣喜地看到，工业化能够带来的是更先进，也更能发挥每个人能力的管理模式。\n其三，则是成本以及行业场景的远期变化。\n有群友回答说，未来的游戏行业会有明显的两极分化现象。这点我非常同意——但是原因跟工业化的生产方式其实关系不大。更多的原因在于需求的变化：即使是在F2P领域，玩家亦需要表现力更佳的“大”游戏。\n诚然，对于多数厂商来说，将自己舒适区内的开发模式更替为更工业化的开发模式，确实会有段时间的成本上升以及转型的阵痛。但长期来看，工业化的产能是能够在一定程度上降低成本的。\n君不见EA，Ubi等等海外开发商，即使在海外他们的人力成本已经跟国内持平甚至更低了。但单纯从开发能力来看，国内还没有哪家公司敢说他们比海外厂商强的。\n更近一步讲。即使对于个人/独立开发者来说，工业化体系下催生的产品，也会对他们的开发提供便利——君不见，Unity的普及让我们其实前所未有地容易开始做游戏了（当然真不真的去做又是另一回事）。\n这最终导致的是游戏开发的商业电影-艺术电影分化，不肯找到自己真实地位的厂家被大浪淘沙。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知乎用户（登录查看详情）\n点击下载\n17 个回答，查看全部。\n原神2.0版本稻妻版本，能否说明米哈游原神制作组已经完成团队磨合，进入游戏工业化高产能状态?\n你为什么会觉得做独立游戏和做工业化游戏差不多呢?",

          "description": "我是在传统老牌的西方 AAA 公司工作 15 年后加入中国游戏研发工作室的，我结合自己的观察和体验，尝试回答这个问题。\n近几年，中国的游戏公司有很大的变化，逐渐向重视原创、追求更高品质、打造具有中国文化特色的游戏产品转变。最近经常听到这样一句话“中国游戏玩家的口味越来越高，国内的游戏公司也开始卷起来了。”\n“卷”这个词用在这样的语境下，我认为不是件坏事，它代表着随着市场需求的变化，中国的游戏厂商对于品质的重视程度变得越来越高。\n国外的 AAA 厂商已经这样“卷”了十几年了：游戏的画面越来越接近影视化，内容丰富度和体量越来越高，争相进行技术上的探索和突破，同时创新的作品也层出不穷。我很高兴看到中国的游戏公司也以这样的方式“卷”起来，让中国的游戏产品在各个维度上与国外的 AAA 大作掰一掰手腕。\n\n我相信这样的转变，对于许多海内外从事 AAA 游戏开发的人才选择加入中国游戏公司，是一个至关重要的前提。 \nAAA 游戏的开发是一个先慢后快的过程。一个非常有经验的 AAA 游戏团队，也可能要花费 1-2 年的时间来完成概念和创意方面的探索，2-3 年左右的时间进行试生产（Pre-production），这里主要包括设计方面的验证和技术管线的搭建。\n所以，经常会出现游戏开发了 4、5 年，看起来却只有一个垂直切片以及一大堆白盒和临时资源的情况。但接下来会是神奇的一段时间，通常 80% 的游戏内容，都是在最后的 1 年到 1 年半时间里完成的。\n这种“神奇”有一个前提条件，就是整个团队可以沉下心来，完成前面提到的创意设计和试生产环节，否则最后的全面投产（Full-production）将会是一场灾难。\n每一部 AAA 游戏的开发都是一趟漫长的旅程，耐心，信心和决心三样缺一不可。而我已经在国内的游戏厂商中看到了这三样东西，所以我回来了。\n从 EA 到天美\n我在 2006 年加入 EA 上…",

          "description": "游戏是我从一而“衷”的选择。我大学毕业就一头扎进了游戏行业，从业至今，由一名普通设计师成长为主美，大约16年多点。这份选择从最初到如今或是将来，都不会变，所以在这里，我用了衷于初心的“衷”而不是终点的“终”。\n游戏和动漫是我的两大爱好。与很多80后一样，在成长的时光里，我都是在棚里看别人玩《魂斗罗》，或是在街机厅打《街霸》中度过的。记得在作文作业里，我还写过一篇从8位机开始一路到当时的SFC 32位机的游戏主机发展史这种让老师一脸懵逼的作文。所以，我自认为一直是一名游戏爱好者。但可能喜好更偏向于动作，冒险且有剧情的游戏类型。\n与此同时，我对动漫的热情也从未减少。因此在读书阶段，自己的休息和考试奖励基本都是被允许画漫画和游戏里的角色。后来，我有了让中国动漫形象席卷全球的愿望。这个愿望或许有些太大了，但自己始终在期盼这一天的到来。\n大学毕业答辩时，我的论文题目是《如何推广中国卡通形象》。当时我感觉国内在这块的整个产业链还不完善，想要从动漫衍生出高认知，高流传度的形象或是文化理念会比较缓慢。所以在论文里，我是把游戏这样一个商业化相对成熟的产品放在第一推广位，然后再同步动漫周边等。这也是为什么我会直接选择游戏行业而不是其他行业。\n入行后，我在第一家公司做的是手游，现在自己仍在开发手机游戏，感觉有些事情可能确实讲究点机缘。加入腾讯之前，除手游外，我还参与过PC和各类掌机，以及08到11年期间所有主流主机游戏的开发。但始终我都在做欧美向的设计。\n直到进了腾讯，我才真正开始参与到国人自己的游戏研发中去。然而在刚开始的时候，我参与的项目在美术风格上依旧是偏欧美的。\n直到2012年末，我在天美开始参与第一批风格全民化的微信游戏开发。从那时起，通过一个又一个的项目，我才逐渐将自己的美术风格往亚洲审美上靠。\n最终在17年8月，我们研发的国风战争策略手游——《乱世王者》顺利上线了。（以下简称《乱世…",

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n在之前的文章里，就提到过勇士的防守死穴：对上真正顶级天赋的大个子，他们的体系会被强拆。这也是勇士以夺冠为目标情况下，面临的最大隐患。而今天对太阳的比赛里，这种更多停留在“讨论”阶段的隐患，终于露出了危险的一角。全场比赛，在防守端，108.3分的百回合失分也远差于大样本下联盟第一的100.4分。\n而将勇士的防守打到这个地步的，是布克或保罗的挡拆持球攻吗？布克只打了15分钟，保罗的回合占有率也只有18.2%，并没有像惯常预计的那样，接过布克留下来的球权，包揽一场比赛的进攻。真正让勇士无法防守的，是中锋艾顿，打出了远远超出常规赛20.2%水平的30.1%回合占有率，真实命中率也保持在57.8%，而他的得分方式却并没有比平时有所进化，83.3%都来自于油漆区，且两分球受助攻率72.7%，依然是我们印象中的那个出手范围较为狭窄的篮下终结点。\n\n更多需要控球手“喂饼”的艾顿，常理上讲似乎不应该成为勇士防守的障碍，反而是勇士最喜欢的那种进攻方式。本赛季的勇士，将小阵容提到了常规使用的程度，正牌中锋鲁尼只有18.3分钟的时间，18.8分钟的奥托波特、14.9分钟的别利查，分别在五号位打了53%和100%的时间。这套小阵容对上线持球人的压制能力极强，几乎可以在任何对位中都不被抓住防守弱点，且可以兼顾到对侧翼的轮转。对持球人的局部空间以人数压缩，对侧翼依靠轮转补位，外扩的防守风格可能出现的篮下空虚问题，则由对持球人的传球线路的封锁来缓解。由此，勇士便做到了对对手进攻组织与串联的切割，对发动机有重点施压，对弱侧也有人员顾到，让对手无法通过个人威胁与顺畅传导盘出足够合理的进攻回合，被迫打成高难度的单打和出手。\n本赛季，勇士有53.9%的防守回合处在篮下15FT以外，集体外扩程度排名联盟第四。而在效果上，与勇士对阵的球队场均只能拿到21.6次助攻，联盟第四，被防到42.…",

          "description": "答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。\n首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。\n再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。\n其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。\n比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。\n\n例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。\n举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……\n说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。\n\n普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。\n当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   \n那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？\n\n答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。\n\n如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国汽研指数专家\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n请问，哪个品牌的汽车，方向盘助力做的较好，能不能比较一下？（方向盘比较轻柔，不用费太大力气。）？\n为什么大部分汽车的方向盘不在中间？",

          "description": "开发者来强答一波\n《物理世界》的灵感诞生于CIGA Game Jam 2019上。\n当时的题目是一张这样的图片：\n\n\n\n（看到图片的我亿脸蒙蔽XD）\n但没办法，题还是要做的哇，所以我就在想，这爱心到底怎么插入小人中奖的三角形？\n\n一般正常情况下看到这个问题，肯定是会想到“父母的爱对孩子来说太沉重”，“看起来好的东西不一定适合自己”一类的观点，但可能是我苦于物理荼毒久已，导致我第一时间想到的事居然是——\n\n爱心通过怎样的形态变化能成为三角形，最终契合进小人的内心？我脑内闪过了一万个公式，发现都没有办法解决我的疑惑。\n进而，我联想到了《Baba is you》——一款通过不同的组合方式产生不同的效果，最终解决谜题的作品。\n\n\n\n\n虽然和物理世界不尽相同，但通过不同组合方式，改变角色行动逻辑，最终让角色成功移动到终点的解谜内核触动了我。彼时的我已经把题目图片抛之脑后，满脑子只想的是“我要把各种物理公式嵌进一款解谜游戏中”，让玩家再次体验被物理课堂所支配的......\n就这样，初版的物理世界诞生了。\n\n（老版本的物理世界，当时主角还不是盒娘）\n\n尽管Game Jam很快就结束了，我们对继续制作《物理世界》的热情却丝毫没有熄灭。\n首先，我们决定更换美术素材——黑板的绿底白字让人感觉过于古板，于是我们打算采用更卡通的风格让画面更有活力。\n\n\nGame Jam上制作的版本中的地图的地形均为直接绘制，这不利于后续关卡的搭建和维护。我们首先换用了TileMap插件来搭建地形和绘制方块。但它的自由度不是很高，有些比较不规则的图形无法实现。于是我们又换用了更加自由的SpriteShapeController来编辑地形。\n\n\n继续制作解密游戏最重要的一点就是丰富关卡内容了。为了扩充关卡内容，我们在接下来的时间里制作了更多的关卡，包括摩擦力关卡、浮力关卡、圆周运动关卡以及动量关卡。\n\n 摩擦力关卡\n\n浮力关卡\n\n圆周运动关卡\n\n动量关卡\n一切关卡的设计思路以有趣为前提，为此我们也都是绞尽脑汁，不断迭代我们的作品。\n当内容逐渐丰富之后，游戏主要矛盾逐渐转移到了用户的游玩体验之上。\n在游玩《Baba is you》的过程中，尽管你会被他惊艳的创意所折服，但有时也会莫名其妙的过关弄昏头脑。\n如果玩家与设计者的脑洞没有对上，关卡的乐趣就会骤减，原本精妙的解谜关卡设置在玩家眼中可能会“过于电波系”，让玩家一头雾水，卡关的挫败感也许会让他们不再打开这部作品。\n\n为了解决这样的问题，在设计比较复杂的关卡的时候，我们或有意或无意地留下了多于一种的过关方式。\n\n\n\n\n在这个关卡中，你可以选择黄色和紫色方块中任何一个用于垫脚\n\n我们加入了提示系统以避免避免玩家长时间的卡关导致失去兴趣的情况出现，但于此同时，我们也不会给予玩家包办式的过关引导——玩家依然需要去考虑如何实现提示系统中的各条提示，它们一般都不会太难，只是需要花点时间。\n\n\n同时，为了玩家能够更好地get到我们设计时的脑洞，我们也特地的在靠前的引导关卡中以更简单的方法呈现给玩家。\n\n这个关卡的过关方式中需要用方块将红色小旗撞下来。\n在本作最开始的测试中，许多玩家第一次看到这样的关卡时，往往无法第一时间悟到本关的解谜机制，最终会因为定式思维卡关很久。\n我们注意到了这点，于是在较为前面的关卡中加入了这样的一关来进行引导。\n\n这关需要玩家用蓝色方块将红色小旗撞下\n这样一来，玩家能更容易地理解并利用这样的机制进行解密。\n在游戏进行测试的过程中我们发现，有的玩家在一开始就难以理解这个游戏的机制——用物理公式来控制场上的物体。甚至在第一关就不知所措。于是我们又额外增加了教程关卡来解决这个问题。\n\n\n教程关中通过文字一步步的指导，让玩家了解游戏的机制以及游玩思路——这成功地降低了游戏的上手难度，也让这部作品能够得以有机会被更多用户所看到。\n一起来体验《物理世界》的美妙吧！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n团长大人\n点击下载\n2 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么现在好多单机游戏都做开放世界？\n怪猎世界中有什么整活的流派？",

          "description": "平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。\n首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。\n《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。\n其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。\n然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）\n1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。\n\n游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。\n2. 关于形状的错觉。\n\n一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。\n3. 颜色的错觉。\n\n\n这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）\n4. 负空间。\n\n在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。\n5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）\n\n虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。\n6. 倒影或平面变成实体\n\n挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。\n7. 透过遮罩的场景\n\n我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？\n8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方\n\n这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。\n游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。\n第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nmonokura\n点击下载\n53 个回答，查看全部。\n《纪念碑谷》里有哪些难以发现的细节？\n纪念碑谷为什么会火？",

          "description": "《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。\n番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。\n当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。\n至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。\n第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。\n第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。\n最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。\n以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nhaolin\n点击下载\n40 个回答，查看全部。\n动画《时光代理人》已经完结，如何评价这部作品？\n谁是动画史上最糟糕的角色？为什么？",

          "description": "两不疑第一季完结在即，也借此机会对项目做个简单的总结梳理，在动画创作、制作上跟大家一起交流下。\n两不疑动画项目从最早的PV开发也就是最早放出的一分半完整版pv短片，到正剧制作流程开发，正剧制作，上线，每周一集供应，周更一直到第一季完结。前后近两年时间，每个阶段都面临不同的困难和问题，而这两年也是纸飞机动画作为传统3D动画团队从开始接触三渲二到研发自己的三渲二视效建立三渲二制作流程的过程。\n回想两年前第一次跟IP方漫漫漫画一起探讨两不疑的动画改编时，第一个面对的问题就是两不疑动画的视效风格是选择3D还是三渲二。\n传统3D视效风格纸飞机本身制作流程成熟，在制作和预算控制上更有把握，而三渲二更适合还原漫画画风，可以给观众带来更贴合原著的体验感，但面临在预算有限的情况下还要从头摸索制作方案和视效风格的问题。\n当时双方一拍即合，三渲二！不论是画风、故事、角色塑造以优先还原原著为第一位。\n\n两不疑如果要做动画就要给漫画粉丝呈现一个她们期待中的两不疑动画。预算不足的问题通过延长PV开发周期来解决，给制作组一个较长时间来研究和适应新风格，利用其他项目的间歇来解决三渲二技术开发并完成PV制作。\n最终1分30秒的PV用了9个月的时间制作完成，通过PV开发制作组熟悉了三渲二的制作方案也对两不疑的画风建立了了解。\n\n徐钰美术设定\n\n徐钰角色资产lookdev\n\n国师面部阴影开发\n随着pv上线，两不疑正剧的前期工作也正式展开，在我个人的经验中长篇动画的创作生产与短片、CG有着本质的区别。一部能达到及格线的长篇动画首先考验的是各个核心主创环节的专业性和配合度，确立分工配合！\n由B站的监制老师把控整体方向，IP方漫漫漫画负责整体项目制片，两不疑漫画编辑以及原作者负责剧本原著方向把控，避免人物ooc，提供剧本修改的解决方案，纸飞机负责导演和执行制片及全片制作。\n呼，松了口气，终于不用担心我一个直男导演一不小心把两不疑改成少年热血番了。\n\nOk!原著漫画有好的故事基础，人物塑造到位，又有原作者帮忙把控原著方向，不用担心跑偏。那剩下的就是导演技术型工作了。\n如何将原著较为片段化的桥段和情节串联起来，如何把原著的故事讲的更有趣更有悬念，如何让观众更好的代入故事和了解认同角色，是否有原著中被省略或可以扩展的情节能提出来做点小原创发挥玩一下，可以说整个改编的工作更像是导演基础技巧训练。\n正剧前期工作推进的同时，针对两不疑剧集的三渲二流程也同步在研发中。与PV短片的制作流程不同，在短片中更关注如何实现三渲二的最终画面效果，角色、场景资产的制作会根据镜头的需要来规划和实现效果。到了剧集首先要解决大规模生产协作和制作成本优化问题，所有制作方案和效果必须建立统一的制作规则和尽量实现全流程的工具化操作。\n\n\n\n由于整个项目本身预算不高，为了在有限的预算和档期内尽量达到最佳效果，两不疑项目的整个制作过程中一直在镜头设计、制作方案和最终效果上寻找平衡点。在镜头设计上减少非必要的与故事表达无关的运动镜头，尽量使用固定机位镜头来进行叙事，一些常规的镜头运动采取2D动画的后期运镜方式，把更多的设计精力和预算放在构图把控和镜头节奏剪辑上。\n\n在动画上，项目早期也测试过动作捕捉方案，动作捕捉对剧集动画有着生产速度更快，生产周期更好把控的优势。但写实的动画风格跟两不疑不搭，而两不疑里的文戏、情感戏占比较多，对动画表演的准确度和关键表演细腻程度要求很高，最终为了更好的呈现两不疑的风格还是选择了全片使用传统手key动画。\n\n超过240分钟手工动画带来的问题就是，需要寻找大量外包合作的动画团队和动画师一起协作参与制作。如何控制动画成本？如何让各个团队统一动画表演风格？如何应对参差不齐的动画质量和海量的动画反馈？\n解决的关键在layout！\n在3Dlayout 环节导演要确定所有创作和角色关键表演信息，避免在大规模制作生产环节进行创作和修改。为了做到这一点两不疑的3Dlayout全部由纸飞机内部的动画师和有多个项目配合经验的合作方完成，在这个阶段进行大量互动沟通和反馈来确定镜头构图及表演创作，同时也参考了传统2D动画的故事板和原画流程，用尽量少的关键帧来确定镜头构图和角色的表演。\n\n\n虽然关键帧较少，但每个关键帧从角色POSE到表演状态上都达到最终的动画表演级别，用少量关键帧卡准表演的关键节奏点。这样来避免在进入正式的动画的生产环节因设计不确定而产生的大量重复性修改及损耗，也便于控制整个动画中期的质量和统一风格。\n\n以上是两不疑项目中我个人感觉一定有代表性的经验和问题，简单的整理下分享给大家，也欢迎对两不疑和三渲二感兴趣的朋友一起多多交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n王丰彬\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价电视剧《两不疑》?\n如何评价漫画《两不疑》？",

          "description": "谢邀\n我从以下四个方面解答这个问题：\n\n1、香型的由来\n2、香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌\n3、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n4、香型如此多，我们怎么选？\n\n一、香型的由来：\n酒自诞生开始，就有香味的区别，不同地域、不同技艺，形成了各自的代表酒。但在1979年以前，中国白酒是不分香型，统称为蒸馏酒。\n香型正式区分，是1979年在大连召开的全国名优白酒协作会议及第三届全国评酒会上提出的，在第三届大会的时候分别从气味、成分、微生物、酿造工艺等方面综合评价：确认了5类香型：清香、浓香、酱香、米香、其他香型（不属于其他香型的统统归在这）。\n随后，经过进一步研究，扩展为12种香型：\n清香型、浓香型、酱香型、米香型、兼香型、药香型、凤香型、特香型、芝麻香型、老白干、馥郁香和豉香型。\n\n二、各个香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌。\n香型的名称应该反映出本香型产品的个性和内涵，但是香型的划分并不统一：\n有的按照香味的浓烈程度来判断：比如浓香型，判断标准是酒体中的窖香突出。\n有的根据香味所体现的口感特征来判断：比如酱香型，判断标准酱香、焦香、糊香的复合香气。\n还有以产品名称来划分：比如凤香型、老白干香型，特香型。\n为了统一标准，要求必须在每个香型后面加入其工艺、风味特征的描述，于是有了下图：\n\n三、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n为什么中国的白酒香型如此之多？\n总的来说分为以下原因：\n1、历史原因：\n中国多次民族分裂和民族融合，使我国成为多民族文化共存的国家，各民族的地理环境、风俗习惯，饮食习惯的差异，各地人口味千差万别，形成了“食有千种，味有千样”的华夏饮食体系，由此体系衍生出来的白酒，就变成多种香型共存的口感需求。\n2、技术发展：\n由于生产工艺的创新发展，酿造原料的多样性，各个区域形成了特色、风格不同的各种香型的白酒，加上地理环境的差异性，导致不同区域的酒曲、窖泥、酒醅和地域环境，都对微生物有不同的影响，从而影响到发酵的速度，香味，口感等。\n四、面对种类如此多的香型，我们应该怎么选择？\n（1）如果你之前没有喝过白酒，但是最近想开始试着接触白酒，那我建议你可以从清香、米香开始，这两个香型，口感比较淡，入口绵顺柔和，舒适度高，刺激性较弱，有利于给初次接触的人，留下一个好印象。\n我推荐汾酒和三花两个品牌的中端酒，这样能提升白酒的好感度、趣味性和持续性。\n比如这款老白汾15：\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/9ce8fdbdc0133fa79cfe34337ead254c?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n（2）如果你已经接触了一段时间白酒了，那我推荐你看看各知名品牌，在这我也推荐几款虽然名气比不上一线，但是酒质和性价比绝对划算的品牌，这几款酒一定可以让你惊艳。\n酱香：年份潭酒、金质、丹泉。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/c0015374386b79f17e3795fecfe84c87?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n浓香：丰谷、五粮春、泸特、金剑南\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/df5d7945012c7e7275e1e56ca47ef7b9?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：口子窖\n（3）如果你是老酒鬼，那就看看下面这些公认的性价比高的口粮酒吧。\n清香：汾酒、红星、牛栏山。\n浓香：双沟圣坊、文君、今世缘（单开、对开）、丰谷酒王10。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/8116e263867e34fc8715090921f95010?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n酱香：金质、金酱、武陵少酱、金沙回星。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/4d01d2a2702995759d67b86e17cc24bf?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：白云边15年、口子窖6年。\n特香：东方弘韵。\n食有千种，味有千样，喝酒重要的不是香型，而是喝酒气氛、讲出来的故事、带动的情绪，饮酒之趣，在于不同时间、不同环境，喝酒体验大相径庭。\n如果你觉得文章让你进一步了解白酒的香型，请点个赞再走吧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知酒浓\n点击下载\n256 个回答，查看全部。\n有哪些 酱香型、浓香型、清香型、兼香型白酒适合做口粮的？\n酱香型、清香型、浓香型等白酒究竟有哪些区别？",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",

It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. \n\nI saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.\n\nHalo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. \n\nSo again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release\n\n\nSUPPORT the Channel ► https://www.patreon.com/TheActMan \n\n____TIME STAMPS____\nIntroduction – 0:00 \nDisappointing News – 4:03\nLack of Content – 7:23\nGame Modes & Playlists – 11:08 \nCustom Games are Broken – 20:05\nFinal Thoughts – 28:33\n\n✪ CONNECT WITH ME ✪ \nSubscribe ↪ https://www.youtube.com/c/TheActMan?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter ➤ https://twitter.com/TheActMan_YT \nAct Man TV ➤ http://bit.ly/2kPXk7f  \n\nDiscord ➤ https://discord.gg/yBABtkh  \nInstagram ➤ https://www.instagram.com/theactman_yt/ \nXbox Live Gamertag ➤ The Act Man",

With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.\n\nAbout Peacock: The streaming service from NBCUniversal that’s as free as a bird. Current hits. Timeless classics. Timely updates.
