Keeping all of that infrastructure in the same CloudFormation stack can sometimes be troublesome however, and there are many reasons why you might consider having parts of it in a separate stack. A common approach is to keep stateful infrastructure, such as your DynamoDB tables or S3 buckets, in one stack, and stateless infrastructure, such as your Lambda functions or API gateways, in another. This way, you can more freely update or even tear down the stack that's naturally often changing while not risking affecting the long-living infrastructure that your application depends on.

There’s something incredibly awesome about having a personal voice assistant to be able to give us information, manage our schedules, and just help us out with our day to day lives.\nIn this article, we’ll build a foundation with python that you can use to build your own personal voice assistant.\nThe foundation of our program will be a speech recognition library and a Text to speech library(TTS) which will allow us to communicate with our script purely through audio.\nThe script will run on a loop of:\nWaiting for a command from the user\nUnderstanding and fulfilling a command\nWe’ll add some basic examples to do some small talk, tell the time, open apps and a few other things. This foundation can very easily be augmented to add whatever functionality you might want from your assistant. If you can do it in python, you can make the bot do it.\nIn a new python project, first install the speech recognition library with:\npip install SpeechRecognition\nAnd install the TTS library with:\npip install pyttsx3\nIn a python file, we’re then going to:\nLoad in our imports\nConfigure the text to speech\nDefine our speech function\nThe bot above can fulfill the following commands:\nTell the time\nGive a random number\nOpen and Close Slack\nWhatever tasks you want your assistant to complete, you can now simply add another conditional to the list!\nOf course, you can add a lot more complexity:\nPower the assistant w/ Conversational AI via Rasa\n\nPlay music with the Spotify API\nPull information from wikipedia via Web Scraping\n\n\n\nThat’s all for today!\nGot any questions?

          "description": "Lets take a look at how to render a component on a certain route conditionally using React router v6 features.\nInstall React Router V6 using the following npm command:\nnpm install react-router-dom@6\nNext, import the following components from react router dom.\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Routes,\n  Navigate,\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nFirstly wrap all the content of your page inside the return function inside the . Next, create the induvial routes inside the  component.\nreturn (\n    <Router>\n      <Routes>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n        <Route exact path=\"start\" element={<Start />} />\n      </Routes>\n    </Router>\n)\n\nFor each route, we have the path and the element props, these tell the path on the address bar and the component to be rendered out respectively. The exact prop ensures that the *location.pathname * will match exact location path.\nLets say we want to render a component only if a state is true for example if a user is logged in, we can do that like this:\n<Route\n  exact\n  path=\"start\"\n  element={\n    loggedIn ? (\n      <Start />\n    ) : (\n      <Navigate replace to={\"/\"} />\n    )\n  }\n/>\n\nBasically here we are checking if the loggedIn state is true. If it is, we return the Start component, however if it is false, we redirect the user to the homepage using the Navigate element.\nThe replace prop simply replaces the current location with the given path instead of adding on to it.\nThanks for reading!",

          "description": "All cryptocurrencies in the world work on blockchain technology. But today our team has stepped into a new evolution.\nCryptum (CCM)?\n\n\nCryptum is the first cryptocurrency running on the CCNet network. CCNet (Cryptum Cyber Network) is a large network running on a single server. To use Cryptum, other computers must connect to a server with a CCNet network. Transactions in Cryptum are public and stored in the database of the CCNet network. Cryptom has SRDB (Sender Receiver Data Base) protocol for transactions. Transactions work based on this protocol.\nThe main advantage of Cryptum over other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is that transactions can be carried out like a simple transfer through the \"LiteFast\" function. For example, transactions in other cryptocurrencies sometimes have to wait for hours. Cryptum does not have this problem.\nIn order to mine cryptum coins in Cryptum, your computer needs to run a digital algorithm. The digital algorithm does not allow your computer to mine 0.5 CCM or more.",

The popular ones include\nMermaid - A diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions. Supports drawing of Flowchart, Sequence Diagram, Graphs, Class Diagrams, ER Diagrams and much more\nGraphviz - A graph visualisation software to represent structural information as a diagram of abstract graphs and networks\nDitaa - a small command-line utility written in Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art \nPlantUML - A component that allows to write Sequence diagram, Usecase diagram, Class diagram, Object diagram, Activity diagram, Component diagram, Deployment diagram, State diagram, Timing diagram and more\nBlockDiag - A Group of projects that has other diagramming tools - BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag\nThe list goes on. Almost all of them are open source and free. Each of these tools are written in different programming languages like Mermaid is written in JavaScript, BlockDiag in Python, PlantUML in Java and so on.\nHaving all of them under a single roof does have its advantages, but setting them up and having the prerequisites can be a considerable task. That's where Kroki comes to the rescue. It is both an open source software that can be installed locally and a service that is free as well.\nIt is astonishing to see the support for various diagramming tools all at one place. Kroki provides support for BlockDiag (BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag), BPMN, Bytefield, C4 (with PlantUML), Ditaa, Erd, Excalidraw, GraphViz, Mermaid, Nomnoml, Pikchr, PlantUML, Structurizr, SvgBob, UMLet, Vega, Vega-Lite, WaveDrom. It is constantly updated to add more tools as well.\nThe beauty of Kroki is that it also provides HTTP APIs to create diagrams that can be accessed using tools like cURL. In addition to the services, it also has a CLI - Command Line Interface - that uses kroki.io as the backend.\nTry Kroki for a happy diagramming!",

Ya, I know it is cool to install your own package using npm i your_component_name 🤩🤩. All these things are very meaningful to a beginner. It will definitely bring a smile on your face 😇.\nHere, We are going to see some easy steps through which you can publish your npm package. For this first you have to build a component that you want to publish. After successfully creating a component just follow the below steps.\nKeep all required files of your component in a single folder let assume it is named as component. \n\n(⚠️All required files of your component must be inside the component folder)\nNow create a index.js file inside this. Refer below image 👇\n\nNow, just import and export your component in index.js file like this 👇\n\n\n\n\nimport your_component_name from './component/your_component_name'\nexport default your_component_name;\n\n(Or, just open this folder with vs code, create a new file named index.js, write these two lines and save it.)\nIf you don't have an npm account just goto npm on your browser and sign up. click here to sign up with npm\n\n\nOpen cmd with in the same folder. Easy way just write cmd at place of your folders path and click enter. Refer below 👇\n\n\n\n\nLogin to npm by this command npm add user\n\n\nNow run this command npm init\n\n\nAfter the above you can see your package.json created over there.\n\n\nIf you have used any third party library then just install them here by which all of these will listed as dependency in your package.json which will help user to get everything installed by a single npm install.\n\n\nNow, create a readme.md describing your component which will be shown in npm.\n\n\nGo back to cmd and run npm publish\n\n\nNow, you can see your package listed in npm.\n\n\n\n🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\nLink to my npm packages\nThank you\nWays to reach me: \nLinkedIn: saurabh satapathy\n\nTwitter: SaurabhSatapat1\n\nGitHub: saurabh190802\n\nEmail: saurabhsatapathy0@gmail.com",

          "description": "We are happy to announce that GitLive's flagship feature, early merge conflict detection, now works across all branches in VS Code! 🎉 \nWhen we first introduced real-time merge conflict detection, only the changes from each of your teammates’ current branch were shown in the gutter. This meant you could miss a merge conflict from changes in a branch that is not currently being worked on, for instance, changes from a PR waiting for review. Now the change indicators in the gutter of the editor show changes from all branches that contain changes compared to your current branch.\nAnd, as before, and as long as you are not in offline mode, this includes the unpushed changes of your teammates that are also not in offline mode for real-time, instant merge conflict detection!\n\nPreviously you had a simple switch to show or hide the indicators you see in the gutter of the editor. Now, similar to the team window, you can filter the change indicators shown in the gutter of your editor by type.\nIt’s worth noting that these filters are independent of the team window filters, but when you change the team window filters the gutter indicator filters are automatically updated to match (but not vice versa). To open the gutter filters menu, click on the GitLive icon in the upper right corner of VS Code.\n\n🔸 Pushed Changes. Turning off pushed changes will hide the indicators coming from the pushed changes on other branches.\n👉  Both pushed and unpushed changes are on by default, turn both off to hide the indicators completely \nThat’s it for now, we would love to know what you think of these updates and how we can make GitLive better for you, so please reach out via the comments section below.\nDon't have the GitLive extension installed yet? You can find it here, and if want to learn more about the latest release, check out this blog post.",

Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that it allows businesses to scale their operations up or down as needed, without incurring the costs of buying and maintaining their own infrastructure. This can be a huge advantage for businesses that experience seasonal spikes in demand, or that are growing rapidly and need to be able to respond quickly to changes in demand.\nAnother benefit in cloud computing is the ability to quickly deploy new applications and services, This can be a big advantage when businesses need to respond quickly to market changes or new opportunities.\nBusinesses can use cloud computing for a variety of purposes, including storage, backup, recovery, computing, and networking. Storage is one of the most popular uses for the cloud, as it allows businesses to store data offsite and access it from anywhere. \nDespite the fact that enhanced security is not a guarantee, cloud computing still offers a number of advantages in this area. By taking advantage of the security measures offered by cloud providers, businesses can help protect their data and applications from unauthorized access.\nOverall, the benefits of cloud computing are vast and varied. I hope this article has inspired you to take advantage of all the cloud has to offer!\nStar our Github repo and join the discussion in our Discord channel.\nBLST!",

Unfortunately,  the immediate reaction of most beginners is to travel into denial. \nIn this post, we’re going to clarify what debugging is, why we do it and how can we get better at it. We’ll also reassess why debugging won't reveal all the issues or bugs in our code. \nDebugging is the process of running your code step by step with a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to seek out the exact point where you made a programming mistake. Usually, you'll understand what corrections you need to make in your code, and debugging tools often allow you to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program.\nThere's no magic solution for bugs. Usually, it takes …",

          "description": "In this article, I will solve a Ups n Downs CSS Challenge on CSS Battle. Let's look at the problem first.\nWe need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:\n\nSo now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. \n<p class=\"left\"></p>\n<p class=\"middle\"></p>\n<p class=\"right\"></p>\n\nNow let's style the containers. \nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  background: #62306d;\n}\n.middle,\n.left,\n.right {\n  position: absolute;\n  background: #f7ec7d;\n  width: 100;\n  height: 100;\n  border-radius: 10rem 10rem 0 0;\n  margin-top: 50;\n}\n.middle {\n  left: 150;\n}\n.left,\n.right {\n  transform: rotate(180deg);\n  bottom: 34;\n}\n.left {\n  left: 50;\n}\n.right {\n  right: 50;\n}\n\nIn CSS Battle you can use 100 instead of 100px. You don't need to define px in CSS. However, if you are using rem or % then you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info visit here  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Alternate Solution\n\n\nThere could be many Alternative Solution I've used this one because of the less characters and simplicity.\n<p l></p>\n<p m></p>\n<p r></p>\n\nHere I am using <p> tag and inside them l stands for left, m stands for middle and r stands for right.\nbody{\n  margin:0;\n  background:#62306D;\n}\np[m],p[l],p[r]{\n  position:absolute;\n  background:#F7EC7D;\n  width:100;\n  height:100;\n  border-radius:10rem 10rem 0 0;\n  margin-top:50;\n}\np[m]{\n  left:150;\n}\np[l],p[r]{\n  transform:rotate(180deg);\n  bottom:34;\n}\np[l]{\n  left:50;\n}\np[r]{\n  right:50;\n}\n\nMinify the code or CSS by using any CSS Minifier. It helps you to reduce the characters in the code that will increase score.\nIf you like this then don't forget to ❤️ it. And I'll see you in the next article. See you soon.",

          "description": "1. What is Dask cuDF?\n\n\nDask cuDF is a library that enables users to work with large dataframes using the dask distributed computing framework. cuDF is a columnar dataframe library that is part of the NVIDIA RAPIDS initiative. Dask cuDF allows users to scale up their data processing workloads by making use of the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs.\nThere are several other libraries that provide similar functionality to dask cuDF. These include Apache Arrow, Pandas, and PySpark. However, dask cuDF has some advantages over these other libraries.\n\nThere are some challenges that come with using dask cuDF. One challenge is that it can be difficult to install and set up dask cuDF on your system. Another challenge is that dask cuDF is still under active development and its API may change in future releases. Finally, dask cuDF is not as welldocumented as some other libraries, making it difficult to learn how to use it effectively.\nThe to_csv() and from_csv() functions are the most basic ways of saving and loading dataframes. They are very simple to use and will work with any type of dataframe. However, they have some limitations. First, they can only save dataframes that fit in memory. Second, they do not support compression. Third, they are not very efficient when saving large dataframes.\nIf you're working with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go. It's much faster than Pandas and easier to use than Spark. So if you're looking for a better way to work with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go.\nStar our Github repo and join the discussion in our Discord channel to help make BLST even better!\nBLST!",

          "description": "微软说他们热爱 Linux 和开源，但我们仍然没有得到对其许多产品的 Linux 原生支持。\n\r\n\r\n虽然他们可能在努力增加更多的支持，比如 可以在 Linux 上安装微软 Edge 浏览器，但对于一个价值几万亿美元的公司来说，这并不出色。\n\r\n同样，微软的 To-Do 服务也是一个受欢迎的服务，它取代了 2020 年关闭的 Wunderlist。\n\r\n如果你不知道的话，我们有很多 可用于 Linux 的待办事项列表应用。因此，如果你想脱离微软 To-Do，你有选择。\n\r\n微软 To-Do 是一个基于云的任务管理应用，让你从手机、桌面和网络组织你的任务。它可以在 Windows、Mac 和 Android 上下载。\n\r\n那么，如果你不愿意使用网页浏览器而使用一个单独的应用，你在 Linux 上能做什么呢？\n\r\nKuro 派上用场了。\n\r\nKuro：非官方的开源微软 To-Do 应用\n\r\n\n\r\nKuro 是一个非官方的开源应用，它为你提供了微软 To-Do 在 Linux 上的桌面体验和一些额外的功能。\n\r\n它是 Ao 的一个分叉，Ao 是一个开源项目，逐渐成为它的解决方案。不幸的是，它不再积极维护了。所以，我遇到了一个似乎可以工作的新复刻。\n\r\n\n\r\nKuro 提供了一些额外的功能，可以让你在应用中切换主题，启用全局快捷方式等。\n\r\n请注意，这个应用是相当新的，但有一个稳定版本可以试用。此外，开发者计划在不久的将来增加更多的主题和功能。\n\r\nKuro 的功能\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你倾向于使用微软的服务（如 Outlook），它的 To-Do 应用应该是组织你的任务的一个完美选择。你甚至可以标记电子邮件以创建任务。\n\r\n使用 Kuro 桌面客户端，你可以得到一些可配置的功能，包括：\n\r\n\r\n能够在启动时启动该程序。\n\r\n获得一个系统托盘图标，以快速创建一个任务，搜索，或检查当天的可用列表。\n\r\n启用全局快捷键。\n\r\n切换可用的主题（深褐色、德古拉、黑色、深色）。\n\r\n切换自动夜间模式，如果你不想不断改变主题。\n\r\n隐藏托盘图标，如果你不需要它。\n\r\n根据需要定制字体大小。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n除了一些功能外，你还可以进入某些设置来启用/禁用电子邮件通知、删除前确认等，对待办事项应用体验的进行更多的控制。\n\r\n总的来说，体验并不糟糕，但我在几分钟内注意到用户界面上有一些奇怪的图形问题。我不确定这是否是一个已知的问题。\n\r\n在 Linux 中安装 Kuro\n\r\n你可以从它的 GitHub 发布页面 找到基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的 .deb 包。\n\r\n此外，你可以从 Snap 商店 中在你选择的任何 Linux 发行版上安装它。该软件包也可在 Arch Linux 发行版的 AUR 中获取。\n\r\n开发者还提到，正在开发一个 Flatpak 软件包。所以，你可以关注它的 GitHub 页面以了解更多相关信息。\n\r\n\r\nKuro\n\r\n\r\n你已经试过它了吗？你知道有什么更好的微软 To-Do 客户端用于 Linux 吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/kuro-to-do-app/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "（LCTT 校注：作者原文已经大篇幅进行了修订更新，本文据之前的版本翻译。）\n\r\n今天我在推特上发布了一些关于 OSI 模型如何与 TCP/IP 工作原理的实际表现不相符的观点，这让我思考——OSI 模型到底是什么？通过阅读推特上的一些回复发现，似乎至少存在三种不同的思考方式：\n\r\n\r\nTCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述\n\r\n一个可以用来描述和比较很多不同的网络协议的抽象模型\n\r\n对 1980 年代的一些计算机网络协议的字面描述，这些协议如今大多已不再使用\n\r\n\r\n在这篇文章中，我不打算试图争辩以上哪一个才是“真正”的 OSI 模型——似乎不同的人以所有这些方式思考它。这不重要。\n\r\nOSI 模型有七层\n\r\n在我们讨论 OSI 模型的含义之前，让我们大致地讨论一下它是什么。它是一个抽象模型，用于描述网络如何在七个编号的层上工作：\n\r\n\r\n第一层：物理层\n\r\n第二层：数据链路层\n\r\n第三层：网络层\n\r\n第四层：传输层\n\r\n第五层：会话层\n\r\n第六层：表示层\n\r\n第七层：应用层\n\r\n\r\n我不会再费时地去解释每一层的含义，网上有上千种解释可供查询。\n\r\nOSI 模型：TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述\n\r\n首先，我想谈谈人们在实践中使用 OSI 模型的一种常见方式：作为对 TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述。OSI 模型的某些层非常容易映射到 TCP/IP：\n\r\n\r\n第二层对应以太网\n\r\n第三层对应 IP\n\r\n第四层对应 TCP 或 UDP（或 ICMP 等）\n\r\n第七层对应 TCP 或 UDP 包内的任何内容（例如 DNS 查询）\n\r\n\r\n这种映射对第二、三、四层很有意义——TCP 数据包有三个标头header对应于这三个层（以太网标头、IP 标头和 TCP 标头）。\n\r\n用数字来描述 TCP 数据包中的不同标头非常有用——如果你说“第二层”，很显然它位于第三层“下方”，因为二比三小。\n\r\n“OSI 模型作为字面描述”的古怪之处在于，第五层和第六层并不真正对应于 TCP/IP 中的任何内容——我听说过很多关于第五层或第六层可能是什么的不同解释（你可以说第五层是 TLS 或其他东西！）但它们没有像第二、三、四层那样“每一层在 TCP 数据包中都有相应的标头”这样的明确对应关系。\n\r\n此外，TCP/IP 的某些部分即使在第二层到第四层也不能很好地适应 OSI 模型——例如，哪一层是 ARP 数据包？ARP 数据包发送一些带有以太网标头的数据，这是否意味着它们是第三层？或是第二层？列出不同 OSI 层的维基百科文章将其归类为“第 2.5 层”，这并不令人满意。\n\r\n因为 OSI 模型有时用于教授 TCP/IP，若搞不清楚它的哪些部分可以映射到 TCP/IP，而哪些部分不能，则会令人困惑。这才是真的问题。\n\r\nOSI 模型：用于比较网络协议的一个抽象\n\r\n我听说过的另一种关于 OSI 的思考方式是，它是一种抽象，可以用来在许多不同的网络协议之间进行类比。例如，如果你想了解蓝牙协议的工作原理，也许你可以使用 OSI 模型来帮助你——这是我在 这个网页 上找到的一张图表，显示了蓝牙协议如何适配 OSI 模型。\n\r\n\n\r\n另一个例子是，这篇维基百科文章 有一个 OSI 层列表，详细划分了哪些特定的网络协议对应于这些 OSI 层。\n\r\nOSI 模型：一些过时协议的字面描述\n\r\n维基百科上的一些非常简短的研究表明，除了对这七层的抽象描述之外，OSI 模型还包含了 一组实现这些层的特定协议。显然，这发生在 70 年代和 80 年代的 协议战争 时期，OSI 模型失败了，TCP/IP 则取得了胜利。\n\r\n这就解释了为什么 OSI 模型无法与 TCP/IP 很好地对应，因为如果当时“获胜”的是 OSI 协议，那么 OSI 模型 将 完全对应于互联网网络的实际工作方式。\n\r\n结语\n\r\n我写这篇文章的初衷是，当我最初学习 OSI 模型时，我发现它非常令人困惑（所有这些层是什么？它们是真实存在的吗？这是网络的实际工作原理吗？发生了什么？）我希望有人告诉我这个只使用 TCP/IP 网络协议的人，只需了解 OSI 模型第二、三、四和七层与 TCP/IP 的关系，然后忽略它的所有其他内容即可。所以我希望这篇文章对某些人能有所帮助！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/11/what-s-the-osi-model-/\n\r\n作者：Julia Evans 选题：lujun9972 译者：hanszhao80 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这是如何在 elementary OS 中启用最小化、最大化窗口按钮的方法。\n\r\n\r\n许多人（大多数是 elementary OS 的新用户）在各种论坛上问这些问题：\n\r\n\r\n我怎样才能在 elementary OS 中启用最小化按钮？\n\r\n我如何启用还原、最小化、最大化？\n\r\n有可能恢复最小化和最大化按钮吗？\n\r\n\r\n这些都是完全正常的问题，而且问问题也是可以的。对吧？这篇指南可以帮助他们在 elementary OS 中获得这些按钮。\n\r\nElementary OS 所使用的 Pantheon 桌面并没有默认的标准窗口按钮。其主要原因是通过 Dock 和应用菜单处理用户行为和活动的不同理念。可以说，这种设计或实现的行为模仿了macOS。\n\r\n不过，许多用户更喜欢窗口按钮，因为这是一个所谓的“肌肉记忆”，而且有些人是从其他桌面环境（甚至是 Windows）迁移过来的。\n\r\n尽管 Elementary 没有为你提供这个默认设置，你仍然可以启用它。下面是方法。\n\r\n启用最小化最大化按钮 - elementary OS\n\r\n打开终端，安装添加 PPA 所需的 software-properties-common 软件包。默认情况下，这个包在 elementary OS 中没有安装（不要问我为什么，真的）。\n\r\nsudo apt install software-properties-common\r\n\n\r\nelementary OS 6 Odin\n\r\nelementary Tweak 工具被重新换了个名字，它现在被称为 Pantheon Tweaks，并正在单独开发中。使用以下命令，你可以安装它：\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/pantheon-tweaks\r\nsudo apt install -y pantheon-tweaks\r\n\n\r\nelementary OS 5 Juno 及更低版本\n\r\n如果你使用的是 elementary OS 5 June 及更低版本，你可以使用相同的 PPA 安装早期的 elementary-tweaks。在终端按照以下命令进行操作：\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/elementary-tweaks\r\nsudo apt install -y elementary-tweaks\r\n\n\r\n更改设置\n\r\n\r\n\r\n安装后，点击顶部栏的“应用Application”，打开“系统设置System settings”。在系统设置窗口中，点击“个人Personal”下的 “Tweaks”。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n在 Tweaks 窗口中，进入“外观Appearance”。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n在窗口控制下，选择布局：“Windows”。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n然后在顶部窗口栏的右侧应该有最小化、最大化和关闭按钮了。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n也有其他组合形式，如 Ubuntu、macOS 等。你可以选择任何你觉得合适的：\n\r\n\n\r\n这篇指南至此就结束了。系统设置中还有其他选项，你可以尝试使用，但窗口管理器 gala 最近删除了这些选项。因此，它们目前可能无法工作。\n\r\n我希望这个指南能帮助你启用 elementary OS 的最小化最大化按钮。如果你需要任何帮助，请在下面的评论栏告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2021/08/enable-minimize-maximize-elementary/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "早在 2009 年，Minecraft 就来到了这个世界。从那时起，它已经成为一种文化现象。在这段时间里，一些开发者发布了具有类似想法和机制的开源游戏。今天，我们将看看其中最大的一个：Minetest。\n\r\n什么是 Minetest？\n\r\n\n\r\nMinetest，简单地说，是一个基于体素voxel的沙盒游戏，与 Minecraft 非常相似。与 Minecraft 不同的是，Minetest 是用 C++ 编写的，并被设计成可以在大多数系统上原生运行。它也有一个非常大的地图区域。地图大小为 “62,000 × 62,000 × 62,000 块”，“你可以向下开采 31,000 块，或向上建造 31,000 块”。\n\r\n有趣的是，Minetest 最初是以专有许可证发布的，但后来被重新授权为 GPL。此后，它又被重新授权为 LGPL。\n\r\nMinetest 有几种模式。你可以建造并发挥创意，或者你可以尝试在各种元素中生存。你并不局限于这些模式。Minetest 有大量的 额外内容，包括 模组mod、纹理包和在 Minetest 中建立的游戏。这主要是通过 Minetest 的 模组 API 和 Lua 完成的。\n\r\n\n\r\n对于那些玩过 Minecraft 的人来说，你会发现 Minetest 中的体验非常相似。你可以挖掘资源，建造结构，并结合材料来制作工具。我在 Minetest 中没有注意到的一件事是怪物。我认为 Minetest 中没有任何生物，但话说回来，我只在创意模式中玩过。我还没有玩过生存模式。\n\r\nMinetest 也被用于 教育。例如，瑞士 CERN 的人用 Minetest 创造了一个游戏，以 展示互联网是如何工作的 以及它是如何被创造出来的。Minetest 还被用于 教授 编程、地球科学以及微积分和三角学。\n\r\n\n\r\n如何安装 Minetest?\n\r\nMinetest 几乎在每个系统上都可以使用。下面是一个命令列表，你可以用它来在一些最流行的 Linux 发行版中安装 Minetest。\n\r\nUbuntu 或者 Debian\n\r\n如果你有一个基于 Ubuntu 或 Debian 的发行版，只要在终端输入这个命令：\n\r\nsudo apt install mintest\r\n\n\r\nArch 或者 Manjaro\n\r\n对于基于 Arch 的系统（如 Manjaro），使用：\n\r\nsudo pacman -S minetest\r\n\n\r\nFedora\n\r\n你可以从 Fedora 服务器中输入以下命令安装 Mintest：\n\r\nsudo dnf install mintest\r\n\n\r\nopenSUSE\n\r\nopenSUSE 用户可以用这个命令安装 Minetest：\n\r\nsudo zypper in mintest\r\n\n\r\nFreeBSD\n\r\nFreeBSD 用户很幸运。他们可以用这个命令安装 Mintest：\n\r\npkg install minetest minetest_game\r\n\n\r\nSnap\n\r\n要安装 Minetest 的 Snap 包，请在终端输入以下命令：\n\r\nsudo snap install minetest\r\n\n\r\nFlathub\n\r\n要安装，请输入：\n\r\nflatpak install flathub net.minetest.Minetest\r\n\n\r\n你可以在 这里 下载 Windows 的可移植执行文件。你也可以在 Android 上安装 Minetest，可以通过 Google Play 或 下载 APK。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n\n\r\n我已经在 Minetest 中花了几个小时在我的本地系统上进行构建和探索。它非常有趣。我还没来得及尝试任何额外的内容，因为我对我玩过的相对较少的游戏部分非常满意。我遇到的唯一麻烦是，由于某种原因，它在 Fedora 上运行缓慢。我可能存在一些配置上的错误。\n\r\n如果你曾经认为 Minecraft 看起来很有趣，但不想花钱，那就去看看 Minetest。你会很高兴你这么做。\n\r\n如果你玩过 Minetest，在评论中告诉我们你的体验如何。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/minetest/\n\r\n作者：John Paul 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

(Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\r\n这是一项后天习得的技能，最初几次需要一些努力。学习如何将大任务分解成更小的步骤可以让您跟踪实现目标或完成大任务的进度，而不会在过程中不知所措。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/1/break-down-tasks\n\r\n作者：Kevin Sonney 选题：lujun9972 译者：Donkey 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "键盘快捷键让我专注于我要传递的内容，而不是它的外观。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n从我记事起，我就一直在使用文字处理软件。当文字处理器从直接格式化转向利用样式来改变文本在页面上的显示方式时，这对我的写作有很大的推动作用。\n\r\nLibreOffice 提供了多种样式，你可以使用它们来创建各种内容。 LibreOffice 将段落样式应用于文本块，例如正文、列表和代码示例。字符样式类似，只是这些样式适用于段落内的内联词或其他短文本。使用“视图View -> 样式Styles”菜单，或使用 F11 键盘快捷键，调出样式选择器。\n\r\n\n\r\n使用样式可以更轻松地编写更长的文档。看看这个例子：作为咨询实践的一部分，我写了很多工作簿和培训材料。一个工作簿可能有 40 或 60 页长，具体取决于主题，并且可以包含各种内容，例如正文、表格和列表。我的一些技术培训材料可能还包括源代码示例。\n\r\n我有一个提供给客户的标准培训集，但我也做定制的培训计划。在处理自定义程序时，我可能会先从另一个工作簿导入文本，然后从那里开始工作。根据客户的不同，我可能还会调整字体和其他样式元素以匹配客户的样式偏好。对于其他材料，我可能需要添加源代码示例。\n\r\n要使用直接格式输入示例源代码，我需要设置字体并调整工作簿中每个代码块的边距。如果我后来决定我的工作簿应该对正文文本或源代码示例使用不同的字体，我需要返回并更改所有内容。对于包含多个代码示例的工作簿，这可能需要几个小时来查找每个源代码示例并调整字体和边距以匹配新的首选格式。\n\r\n但是，通过使用样式，我可以更新定义一次，为正文样式使用不同的字体，并且 LibreOffice Writer 会在所有使用正文样式的地方更新我的文档。同样，我可以调整预格式化文本样式的字体和边距，LibreOffice Writer 会将这种新样式应用到每个具有预格式化文本样式的源代码示例中。这对于其他文本块也是如此，包括标题、源代码、列表以及页眉和页脚。\n\r\n我最近有了一个好主意，更新 LibreOffice 键盘快捷键以简化我的写作过程。我重新定义了 Ctrl + B 设置加粗强调字符样式，Ctrl + I 设置强调字符样式，Ctrl + 空格 设置取消字符样式。这使我的写作变得更加容易，因为我不必暂停写作，这样我就可以高亮显示一些文本并选择一种新的风格。相反，我可以使用新的 Ctrl + I 键盘快捷键来设置字符样式，它本质上是斜体文本。之后我输入的任何内容都使用强调样式，直到我按 Ctrl + 空格 将字符样式重置为默认的无字符样式。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你想自己设置的，请使用“工具Tools -> 自定义Customize”， 然后单击“键盘Keyboard”选项卡以修改键盘快捷键。\n\r\n\n\r\nLibreOffice 通过样式使技术写作变得更加容易。通过利用键盘快捷键，我简化了我的写作方式，让我专注于我要交付的内容，而不是它的外观。稍后我可能会更改格式，但样式保持不变。\n\r\n图片来源：（Jim Hall，CC BY-SA 40）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/6/libreoffice-keyboard-shortcuts\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "GitHub Copilot 来了，它能帮助程序员，为他们提供人工智能的编码建议，不过，它是否会让事情变得更糟呢？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n在 2021 年，我曾花了好几个小时来翻阅 GitHub Copilot 文档，试图弄清楚如何能够加入它的技术预览计划。还好，这一切都得到了回报，我成功加入了预览计划。\n\r\n而现在，它终于可供所有人使用啦！\n\r\n如果你还不知道的话，GitHub Copilot 是一个 AI 助手，可帮助你更快、更高效地编写代码。\n\r\n我能想到的最类似的东西，就是你手机上的（输入法的）自动完成功能。不过，与自动完成功能不同，GitHub Copilot 编写代码，就相当于是在完成整段的句子。\n\r\nCopilot 现已可供大众使用\n\r\n正如我在前面提到的，Copilot 已经处于技术预览阶段将近一年了。这意味着，GitHub 只允许非常有限数量的开发者免费使用它，以换取同意 GitHub 监控他们的使用情况，从而改进程序的最终版本。\n\r\n看起来 GitHub 终于满意地向公众发布了它。现在，任何拥有 GitHub 帐户的人都应该能够使用它，尽管需要付出一定的代价（我很快就会在下面提到）。\n\r\n公告 中提到：\n\r\n\r\n直到不久前，人工智能都没有能够帮助改进代码，开发软件的过程几乎完全是手动的。现在，这种情况正在改变。今天，我很高兴地宣布，我们正在向所有个人开发者提供 GitHub Copilot。你的 AI 配对程序员来啦。\n\r\n—— Thomas Dohmke，GitHub CEO\n\r\n\r\nCopilot 作为免费的编辑器扩展，已经帮助数百万开发者加快了他们的编程速度。然而，它确实是有代价的，无论是直接的还是间接的。\n\r\nGitHub Copilot 定价\n\r\n与几乎所有令人兴奋的新技术一样，Copilot 对某些人来说可能过于昂贵。它将花费你 10 美元/月或 100 美元/年。\n\r\n如果你是开源项目维护者或经过验证的学生，那么你可以免费使用它。\n\r\nGitHub Copilot 不道德吗？\n\r\n围绕 GitHub Copilot 产品的争议巨大且令人担忧。从技术上讲，这个人工智能是使用大家托管在 GitHub 上的代码来进行训练的。\n\r\n因此，基本上，GitHub 是通过使用你的代码来提供一个新产品（如果你愿意的话，还可以加点料）。而且，关于 Copilot，可别忘了，自由软件基金会（FSF）也 建议 不要在 GitHub 上托管代码。\n\r\n我们知道，企业总是喜欢利用事物，但有些人认为这应该不会直接损害托管在 GitHub 上的项目/代码。\n\r\n但是，是这样吗？\n\r\n简而言之，在 Copilot 发布后，许多开发者都分享说，他们发现 GitHub Copilot 生成了受版权保护的代码：\n\r\n\r\n我试了下 GitHub Copilot，这是一项付费服务​​，来看看它是否会使用带有限制性许可证的存储库的代码。我检查了它，看看它是否有我在之前雇主那里编写的代码，该代码有一个许可证，只允许其用于免费游戏，并且需要附加许可证。是的，它确实有。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当然，如果我们查看 GitHub Copilot 的常见问题解答（FAQ），其中提到：\n\r\n\r\nGitHub 不拥有 GitHub Copilot 生成的建议。您在 GitHub Copilot 的帮助下编写的代码属于您自己，由您自己负责。\n\r\n\r\n所以说，你为一项服务付了费，最终却为你的项目增加了不便和更多的工作？\n\r\n在我看来，就简化开发者的任务而言，这听起来一点儿也不令人兴奋。\n\r\n你对此有什么想法？请在下面的评论区中分享一下吧！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/github-copilot/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "喜欢就是生产力，这是昨天飞书玩家大会的 Slogan，我也在视频里分享了一段少数派的小故事，有兴趣的朋友可以去看看回放。我个人很喜欢这句话，顺便分享一点想法。\n我个人的成长经历就印证了这句话，无论是学历（大专）、专业（中医）、背景（贸易），都跟我过去十年做的事情无关（科技、内容、互联网），能走到如今这一步，全是因为喜欢。\n这个喜欢可以分为两部分，一个是喜欢基于文字的表达，也就是写作。不管是小学写作文，还是中学写情书，到工作后写总结报告，我都能从写作中找到愉悦和成就。而这个能力，帮我跨越了专业和背景，获得老师的关注，俘获芳心，在职场中快速晋升，包括说服投资人支持我创业，你说这算不算生产力。\n另一部分，是对电子科技的喜欢，当然这可能是大部分男孩的天性。中学的时候，家里搞电器维修，留下一堆破烂零件，我就利用他们打造自己的「人工」智能家居系统，有各种发光二极管+闪光器构建的氛围灯，还有隐藏各处的喇叭，打造虚拟立体声音响。那时候就畅想过智能家居、无线互联等各种的梦幻场景，今天全都实现了，我也没有被淘汰，乐在其中。\n这两个喜欢结合在一块，有了我的第一个烧麦博客，第一个煮机社区，以及今天的少数派。我们一直在发现和聚拢那些真正喜欢的人，一起创造价值，而不是过于关注他们的专业和背景。\n这个理念也融合到团队的组建和管理当中，每一个成员加入公司的时候，我都会更关注他对少数派的认知，对自己领域的喜爱程度。如果没有这个基础，我们可能会付出大量的管理和沟通成本，还会带来更多的误会和不悦。\n渐渐的，从广大的作者中筛选团队成员就成了最佳模式，这其中不乏清北名校、一线大厂的优秀人才，他们放弃更加稳定和优渥的条件，选择从事自己喜欢的事情，创造更多可见的价值。没有了传统公司的条条框框，更好的释放自身潜能。尽管聚散无常，不管未来走向何处，他们带着的是自己的实战能力，而不是所谓的辉煌履历。\n朋友在一家上市公司当主管，有完备的薪资和股权奖励体系，他却经常跟我抱怨年轻人想法多，离职率很高，而每一个新员工，都要花大量的时间重新建立信任，接手工作。然后又不知道哪一天突然提出离职。\n\n而另一方面，我们同一楼层的游戏公司老板，正在参考少数派办公室的风格，筹划着给团队成员配上升降桌，工学椅，更换有设计感的桌面设备，这些被忽略的细枝末节，却能构建创意氛围，激发团队成员的创造力。\n如今，创业浪潮已过，泡沫退去，一地狼藉。而最终留下来的创业公司，都应该思考自己的企业文化和管理模式，所谓的强势管理驱动，已经不适合这一代年轻人，更不适合创意型企业。用喜欢驱动，才是可持续的生产力。",

          "description": "一、背景介绍\n相信有不少朋友遇到过这样的烦恼，Windows 笔记本有几个按键坏了，笔记本又刚好过了保修期。拿到售后一问，好家伙，修笔记本的薄膜键盘要一百多的维修费。而一百多已经可以买一把机械键盘了，隐隐约约觉得这笔维修费很不值，但是那失灵的几个按键又很膈应。\n本篇文章就尝试为这样的烦恼提供解决思路，除了可以使用 PowerToys 解决外，还会列出一些备选方案。\n\n二、解决思路\n（一）使用 PowerToys 解决\n1.PowerToys 介绍\n\n又有谁能比 Microsoft 更懂 Windows 呢？\n——《少数派 2021 年度应用出炉，这些 App 是我们的「年度之选」》\n\nPowerToys 可以算是 Windows 官方出品的”外挂“或者”瑞士军刀“，其中有很多可以帮助用户提高 Windows 使用效率的功能，本篇文章就是使用键盘管理器功能。\nPowerToys 的键盘管理器功能\n2.使用指南\n读者可以看看键盘上的 F 键，能回想起来上一次使用这些 F 键是什么时候吗？没错，可以尝试把失灵的按键重映射到不常用的 F 键上解决问题。\n重映射键\n比如说笔记本键盘字母区域上面的数字键”9“坏了，而”F9“键又刚刚好在”9“键的上面，所以我把物理键”9“映射到”F9“。\n重映射键”F9“至”9“\n现在，理论上问题已经解决了，当我按下”F9“就能完成如下的输入：\nF9 = 9\nShift + F9 = Shift + 9 = （\n没错，重映射键之后相应的组合键也是生效的！\n3.提醒\n有读者可能感到疑惑，我的”9“键都坏了，那在重映射键界面怎么输入”9“呢？\n好问题，其实在首次设置的时候还是要外接一块正常的键盘的，不过这应该是可以办得到的吧。首次设置好之后，只需保持 PowerToys 的启动时运行为开启状态，那么理论上设置的重映射将一直生效。\n其次，虽然说 F 键有 12 个，理论上笔记本键盘允许坏掉的按键也有 12 个，但是我觉得坏键个数的容忍范围大约在九个左右，因为还是有几个 F 键挺常用的。比如：\nF2：文件重命名\nF5：刷新或者编程工具的快捷键\nF12：网页的检查\n这几个比较常用的 F 键不建议设置重映射。当然，其实能通过键盘管理器的重新映射快捷键解决，甚至使用重新映射快捷键还能映射远多于 12 个的失灵按键，但是到了这个阶段，还是建议直接更换键盘了。\n重映射快捷键\n（二）使用屏幕键盘解决（备选方案）\n屏幕键盘\n（三）使用 AutoHotkey 或者 AutoIt（备选方案）\n其实这类热键脚本语言程序不是那么推荐，因为要进行一定的编程。既然都通过热键解决了，为什么不用 PowerToys 的重映射键呢？\n（四）自己更换笔记本键盘（备选方案）\n其实键盘维修的物料费往往在一百元以下，剩下的都是人工费。想节省人工费自己更换键盘，其实并没有想象中那么难，先仔细检索查阅教程，跟着教程一步一步操作通常还是能成功的。\n比如我就在发现已经有 12 个按键坏掉之后，自己动手更换了笔记本的键盘，甚至还记录下了一篇教程《小米 Air 13.3 拆机换键盘步骤》。\n\n三、结语\nPowerToys 的键盘管理器能做到的不只是重映射失灵的按键，少数派文章《6 个实用技巧和软件，让你的 Windows 11 更加称心如意》就介绍了如何借助 PowerToys 的快捷键重映射处理烦人的 Teams 和小组件，而且少数派中有不少文章介绍 PowerToys 的其他强大功能。\n读者可以在 GitHub 免费下载到 PowerToys。\n（一）关联阅读\n\n微软出品的窗口管理工具，还能让你不再苦记快捷键：PowerToys\nWindows 10 官方「外挂」更新，这 3 个实用小功能你或许用得上\nWindows 10 也有「官方」取色工具了：PowerToys 0.20 更新详解",

          "description": "罗哥就这样退网了，本来想写点什么，写到一半又放下，看完了晚点 LatePost 的采访全文，又无意中刷到了那场八年前的直播辩论，还是忍不住写下这篇。\n在罗哥做手机之前，我是完全不认识他的，毕竟我触网时间比较晚，似乎错过了很多热闹的早期网事。直到有一天，罗哥开始在微博上吐槽各家手机操作系统，包括已经被抛弃的 webOS，作为这个系统的社区站长，我责任感爆棚，用煮机网的官方账号，开始跟罗哥在微博上争论，不打不相识，由此产生了随后的各种故事。 \n那时候煮机网的粉丝才四五万，罗哥的粉丝应该是八百万，结结实实的被网虐了一番。于是我自己下了一个赌注，如果罗哥的手机做出来，有六成专业用户都认可，我就全站挂横幅，并登门道歉。但罗哥应该根本不记得这个事，在众多的微博对战中，我应该是最小，最没有背景的那一个。\n后来，Smartisan OS 发布了，很酷很漂亮，再后来，锤子 T1 上市了，我第一时间买了一台，用了一段时间之后，我觉得我应该道歉，它虽然有很多不完善，但已经是一个很强的手机了，尤其是罗哥这个外行人做出来的。\n就这样，通过微博私聊预约，我在摩托罗拉大厦的锤子科技的会议室见到了罗哥，那天的我超级紧张，因为我是没想到能见到他的，毕竟既是超级网红又是企业老板。\n迟了几分钟，罗哥出现了，对我说的第一句不算客气：麦老板，你有何指教？\n其实可以理解，罗哥脾气直率，很多媒体人见了罗哥，表面说一套，回去又写成另一套，这种事情多了之后，对媒体人的态度自然好不了。但当我表示是专程来道歉，同时希望获得一些创业指导时，罗哥的话匣子就敞开了。\n首先，罗哥不看好媒体创业，尤其是评测媒体，没有良性的商业路径，除非你足够流氓。他还用自己牛博网的经历来告诉我，做内容有多难。罗哥建议我多看看数码产品和配件，深圳有最好的供应链，做点好产品更有价值。\n这次聊天之后，我决定逐渐停掉以「评测和评论」为主的煮机网，集中精力投入到专注软件和教程的少数派，先服务好用户，再拓展 B 端业务。所以我们后来选择了内容付费，数码和配件联名定制，也成了我们今天的收入主力。\n两年之后，我们推出了官方的付费栏目 Power+，拿到外部平台宣传时，需要有名人推荐，我在微信里找了一圈，发现自己实在不认识名人，就冒昧的请求罗哥写一段推荐语。许久之后得到了罗哥的回复，他竟然答应了，并表示他也是少数派的读者，这顿时让我信心倍增。\n又过了一年，罗哥来深圳了，约我喝杯咖啡，那时正是坚果销量过百万的时候，感觉锤子科技终于熬过了最难的阶段，要开始快速发展了。\n罗哥憧憬着未来，顺便问了我的情况：你现在做的怎么样？我说就是做一些软件和系统教程，帮助用户更好的玩转手机。罗哥突然想到，我们手机系统里有很多功能彩蛋，产品经理没空写，营销部门写不好，不如交给你来做吧。\n就这样，我们开始给 Smartisan OS 挖掘使用方法和场景内容，就有了一篇“如何用坚果手机帮我做香港代购”的精彩文章，让大家看到手机系统的生产力价值。当然，也会有一帮人怀疑我们内容造假，但不管怎样，这个专题成了少数派内容服务的经典案例。\n然而事情并没有往想象中发展，鸟巢的发布会我也去了现场，我希望能有重大转折，但感觉 TNT 的摊子铺的太大了，坐在角落为罗哥捏把汗。随后的日子里，不好的消息一个接着一个，可以想象罗哥的焦头烂额，我也再没有去打扰他。\n尽管不希望罗哥失败，Smartisan OS 终究还是被收购了，罗哥为了给锤子科技还债，转身进入了直播带货界。这时，我们的数码配件也终于做出来了，并且进了罗哥的直播间。据了解，正值 iPhone 12 发布，官方充电器减配，当晚的竞标是比较激烈的，但是罗哥还是选择了我们这个新晋小品牌，介绍产品的时候，罗哥也多点评了一句：在我们做手机的那么多年里，少数派是罕见能保持公正评价的科技媒体。我看了之后感慨万千，好在我们的产品设计还算争气，作为最早的彩色充电器，冲进了热销榜第三名。\n如今，罗哥彻底离开了社交网络，很难再看到他的观点和态度，而他在 AR 领域的新产品，可能也要几年之后才能跟大家见面，我突然感觉一个时代结束了，有种莫名的失落感。作为草根出身的东北人，罗哥有没有改变手机和直播行业，我无权评价；但作为理想主义创业者，罗哥实实在在的影响了我和我的事业。\n\n2014 年 8 月 25 日的第一次见面，转眼就过去八年了，我们经历了很多困难，却都没有放弃创业。如今，罗哥五十，我也四十了，依然期待那一天，我们还能江湖再见！",

          "description": "嘿 Siri，核酸检测。\n\n背景\n作者的所在地是郑州，目前我们实行的是每两天（48小时）一次核酸检测。\n所有公共场所或是小区等地均有专属场所码，在进入该场所之前需要使用微信或支付宝扫码，并把扫码结果出示给工作人员，扫码后你的手机上会显示如下信息：\n\n当前场所名称\n动态显示当前日期与时间\n你的姓名与身份证（部分遮挡）\n48 小时内的核酸检测结果\n疫苗接种情况\n如果是绿码，则整体的背景色为绿色\n我是腺体疫苗，只有两针剂\n其中多数公共场所必须 48 小时内的核酸检测结果为阴性才能进入，而除了成年人要每两日检测核酸之外，没有手机身份证的儿童也会在幼儿园、学校等要求下，不定期上传核酸检测结果。\n所以检测核酸几乎成了郑州人民的日常。\n静态核酸检测码\n其他地区不太清楚，但是我们这边全市公共核酸检测，使用的都是同一套系统，且每个人的检测二维码自申请之日起就是固定不变的，这也使得检测码可以被离线调取。\n如何判断你的检测码是否是静态的，可以使用这个方法：\n\n将不同时间获取的检测二维码分别截图储存；\n用微信扫描这些二维码，看里边的文本内容是不是一致的；\n如果内容每次一样，就说明为静态二维码。\n\n为了实现全民出行随时能有 48 小时的阴性核酸，全市像这样的检测屋大概有 4000 多个，分布在大街小巷。在需要做核酸检测的时候，在检测屋窗户右下角的位置让扫码设备扫一下你的核酸检测码，就可以识别出你的信息，然后进行下一步的检测。\n\n为什么要用快捷指令\n正常情况下我们调取核酸检测码，是在一个叫做「郑好办」的 APP 中，大概需要经过 4 次点击才能找到，如果网络状况差，可能等待的时间会更久。所以大多数人都把检测码截图放在相册中，使用的时候打开相册找出来就可以。\n但这种方式始终不够酷。\n使用快捷指令，除了可以迅速出示检测码之外，还可以通过 Siri 调取。而且这些动作也都同时可以在你的 Apple watch 上体验：\n\n举起手臂唤起 Siri ；\n说出「核酸检测」；\n将手表对准扫码设备。\n\n一气呵成。\n\n具体操作步骤\n想要实现单个人的二维码调取非常简单，大体思路就是，把图片转为 Base64 编码1的文本，存入快捷指令（因为快捷指令只能离线存储文本，不能存储多媒体信息），然后在快捷指令中解码呈现。具体的操作步骤如下：\n1.  准备好你的核酸检测二维码截图；\n2. 把截图裁剪为正方形，只保留二维码的部分2；\n3. 通过这个网址将二维码图片转为 Base64 编码的文本；\n4. 转换后的文本要将开头声明数据类型的这部分删除（重要）：data:image/jpeg;base64, 然后复制剩余文本；\n图片分辨率越低，转换后的代码越短，越不容易卡顿\n5. 打开快捷指令，新建一个快捷指令「核酸检测」3；\n6. 拖出一个「文本」组件，并填入第 4 步中转换好并处理完毕的 Base64 编码文本；\n7. 紧接着拖出一个「Base64 编码」组件，并设置为「解码」；\n8. 最后加入一个「快速查看」，设置显示「Base64 已编码内容」，同时将类型设置为「图像」。\n使用「快速查看」而不使用「显示结果」是为了通过Siri语音操作时也可以正常显示\n稍微进阶一下\n如果你像我一样，要时常带着儿子或者女儿去做核酸检测，那么你手机中一定存有他们的检测码。这时候我们把上边的快捷指令稍微改动一下，增加一个二级菜单，就可以实现在一个快捷指令中，调取不同人的检测二维码了。具体改动操作如下：\n1. 在原快捷指令的最上方加入「从菜单中选取」；\n2. 分别命名你要调取的二维码名称（比如：爸爸、儿子、张三等，这个步骤关系到你使用 Siri 操作时的指令语言）；\n3. 在每个菜单分类的下方，加入一个「文本」组件，并通过上方 2、3、4 步骤中处理二维码与 Base64 代码的方法，把处理好的代码分别贴进对应的「文本」组件中。\n\n带有二级菜单的快捷指令，在使用 Siri 调取的时候，需要二次对话，讲出二级菜单的名称。但是真实的场景是，如果不是为了装 X ，更多时候我还是会选择在快捷指令下用手点击调取。\n\n最后\n虽然本文是利用快捷指令来展示核酸检测码，但是同样的方法也可以用于出示其它信息。比如微信名片、推广二维码、或是一些其它你想展示的任何内容。只要你想展示的信息或者二维码是静态固定不变的，就都可以利用该快捷指令实现。你也可以把你经常会用到的静态二维码，利用上方进阶版的方法，全部做到一个快捷指令中，通过二级菜单进行调取。\n每个人对于快捷指令的认识程度各不相同，文章也希望能够让一些零基础的同学自主操作，所以很多地方写的较为详细，目的在于能帮到更多有此类需要的人群。\n感谢阅读，希望文章能对你有帮助。",

          "description": "在上一篇文章中提到目前我国的法规中没有要求有牵引资质的车辆才能拉拖挂房车，因此理论上任何家用车都可以拉拖挂（五菱宏光MINI这类微型乘用车除外）。\n不过我想补充一下，这仅仅只是法规上没有要求而已，我认为这是由于我国拖挂房车市场还没有成熟导致的相关法规缺失，以后大概率会补充相关的法律条款；在这之前我不建议小轿车、低排量SUV用户拉拖挂，除非你确实懂得怎么合理牵引拖挂、明白相关的原理、知道怎么正确安装牵引装置。\n因为这两类车动力太小不适合拉拖挂，而且99%没有针对拖挂房车这个场景做优化，也不会原厂带有牵引结构，如果你不懂相关的知识，很容易给你的前车造成损坏，不仅会危及道路、人身安全，也会影响你车子的价值。欧美地区确实有很多POLO、高尔夫、SMART拉拖挂的，那是建立在它们房车市场成熟基础上的。\n补充完毕，这一篇文章我们来聊一聊拖挂房车上牌和保险的相关事宜。\n拖挂房车要不要上牌？\n根据《道路交通安全法实施条例》第56条，“小型载客汽车只允许牵引旅居挂车或者总质量700千克以下的挂车。”有的小伙伴可能会对这条产生误解，以为只能拉700公斤以下的房车，其实这里提到了两个不同的概念：旅居挂车和700公斤以下的挂车，他们同属于挂车。\n\n \n​而旅居挂车就是我们说的拖挂房车，而根据C6驾照的准驾要求，可以驾驶的是轻型牵引挂车且两车相加小于4500KG，轻型的定义是750KG-4500KG。至于700KG以下的挂车则属于微型挂车了。\n\n​\n​\n那挂车属于机动车吗？根据2020年实施的公安部公共安全行业标准，挂车也属于机动车，因此拖挂房车也是需要上牌的，而且上牌流程和家用车基本一致，需要注意的就是拖挂房车上牌不需要拖挂的交强险，这点在下面细说；然后有的小检测站可能没有检测过拖挂房车所以会不给你检、有的车管所会要求先交购置税再检测等。\n\n​\n拖挂房车交保险要注意什么？\n​首先要明确的是，根据《道路交通安全法》，拖挂房车是不需要投保交强险的，交强险和牵引的前车共享，如果交强险的额度不够赔偿，再由拖挂的商业险进行承担。\n\n​\n所以我们只要购买拖挂房车的商业险就好了。不过由于拖挂还不流行，所以很多小城市的保险公司业务员根本不知道怎么给拖挂房车上保险，他们很可能会给你上特种车辆的保险，这种保险是很贵的，一定要沟通好。一辆十几万的拖挂房车，三者险加车损险一般1500元以内就可以搞定。\n在给拖挂房车上牌时也不需要提供拖挂的交强险，但要提交前车的交强险，这里要注意的是，拖挂房车可以由任意车辆牵引，上牌时上交当时牵引车的交强险即可，不一定非得是你自己车辆的交强险。",

          "description": "前言\n有一段时间没有写钢笔相关的分享了，钢笔在几年内一直是我个人最大的业余爱好。在以往的文章分享和收到的一些咨询中，不少是基础性的使用问题，和对于产品的推荐需求。从我最早2018年开始分享，已经过去了几年，计划重新以入门-进阶-收藏-避坑的系列来和大家谈谈如今对钢笔爱好的个人见解，本篇主要分享钢笔的入门指导。\n还写字吗？为什么用钢笔写字？\n随着电子产品和通讯产品的发展，社会人对于书写的需求愈发减少了，书写已经是生活的非必要部分，书写工具都是非常成熟的工业化产品，进步空间和进步幅度也非常狭小。\n目前世界上最主流的书写工具，必然是中性笔，书写流畅，墨水干速快，书写速度快，使用寿命不错并且主流产品价格低廉。\n\n但以走珠出墨并与纸张接触的中性笔手感偏硬，缺少笔画表现力，在交互体验感上不足。\n在我国文化历史上，毛笔是核心的书写工具；在欧洲早期使用羽毛笔，工业化之后制作出了蘸水钢铁笔，这些天然和没有深度工业化加工的材料由于原材料本身书写形变程度更大，在书写表现力上的表现力更强，也传承着古典的书写仪式感。\n\n现代钢笔在18世纪80年代末由法国保险员威迪文先生发明，其产品核心是利用了毛细现象，制备了毛细管根据气压和笔压原理吸墨和供墨，搭配钢铁笔的笔尖进行书写。\n英文叫做Fountain Pen，意思书写时墨水可以像泉水一样自行流出，所以我国国标和行业内官方称其为自来水笔，本质就是欧洲早期钢铁笔和毛细系统结合而成的书写工具。\n\n自来水笔名字相对拗口，在汉字中又有歧义，所以如今商品名都叫钢笔，1995年出台的国标虽然老旧，但产品分类一定程度上还可以参考，根据笔尖材质分为钢尖和金尖，金尖钢笔也简称为金笔；钢笔笔尖状态，宏观分为暗尖和明尖。半明尖定位不清晰已经基本被弃用，弯尖在国内又称为美工尖，笔画表现力很强，但完全没办法日常使用，也不适合学生练字，所以基本告别了主流市场。\n\n首先，钢笔本身的墨水…",

          "description": "作为一个北方人，来南方的心愿之一就是亲眼看看大海，还记得 2001 年刚到深圳的时候，我跟同学本来应该去「福田」找工作，却阴差阳错的坐上了开往「盐田」的公交车，就这样稀里糊涂的坐到了盐田港。下车之后，查查手上的深圳地图（那时还没有手机），发现这里离大梅沙海滩似乎不远了，我俩一商量，不如先去看看大海吧，万一找不到工作回老家了，也少了一个人生遗憾。\n\n于是，我们从盐田港走到了大梅沙，盘山公路一弯接一弯，路很窄，汽车在身边飞驰而过。没想到地图上的一点距离，竟然有十多公里，精疲力尽之后，我俩终于见到了梦想的蓝海银滩，大家可能不知道，那时候的大梅沙海滩是有很多漂亮贝壳的，我们像孩子一样捡拾了很多。\n转眼几年之后，同学因为家庭原因，选择回到东北老家发展，而我继续留在深圳打拼，结婚生子之后，也搬到了南山，住到了蛇口老区。那时候，离我们最近的海边就是深圳湾。可惜当年的深圳湾可以说是臭气熏天，蛇口的各种废水直接排入海湾，只有靠近福田的的红树林公园稍微好一点。为了恢复深圳湾环境，深圳修了一个巨大的污水回流工程，截流蛇口半岛的生活污水，反向输送到南山脚下的专业污水处理厂。其中的一段工程就在我住的小区门口，从女儿出生到上小学，足足修了好多年。\n\n又过了几年，深圳湾大桥和深圳湾滨海公园都修好了，虽然有了漂亮的甬路和自行车道，没有了排污管道，但水质还没有真正改善，偶尔还是会飘来一阵阵臭味。那几年的我，正处在创业低谷，焦虑无奈，经常去深圳湾公园疯跑和呐喊，面朝大海，发泄内心郁闷的情绪。\n\n不知不觉又过了几年，深圳湾水质变清了，开始有了螃蟹，甚至偶尔看到小鱼，候鸟也越来越多，连接深圳湾的大沙河也全部治理成生态公园，成了人们休闲露营的好去处。我也经常带着孩子去深圳湾小沙滩堆城堡，去草坪休闲露营。回顾这二十年，深圳对环境的思考和改变，就像一个孩子，从犯错到知错，开始一点点的修正。我们见证了深圳湾的环境变化，它也保存了一群深圳人的成长记忆。\n\n前阵子，拜访了成立十年的「红树林基金会 MCF」，我才进一步了解到，整个海湾生态中，最重要的红树林已经很难恢复了，填海阔地改变了原有的海岸结构，并不是简单种树就能解决的。好在各方努力之下，在深圳河的边缘，还是保留了一片相对完整的林系，里面保护着各种候鸟，还有为数不多的豹猫和欧亚水獭。这也让它成为世界上少有的，摩登都市之下的生态湿地。\n\n二十年弹指一挥间，经过多年打拼，我们依然还是一个小企业，没有赚到多少钱，但也希望能为深圳环境做一点贡献，刚好少数派周边「发财水獭」上市，我们决定每销售一个水獭公仔，就捐赠 20 元给红树林基金会，用于更多的红树林湿地研究和科普保护工作。\n期待有一天，我们不在需要红外摄影机，也能在深圳湾看到成群的水獭嬉戏。",

          "description": "jjtom5f2: \n原文发表在我的博客：从 Anki 到 Obsidian ，我的 Spaced Repetition 经历\nSpaced Repetition 定义和作用\n间隔重复，英文叫做\"Spaced Repetition\"，关于它的定义，可看 Spaced repetition-en.wikipedia.org 。\n就我半年的使用来看，Spaced Repetition 有多个好处：\n能够回顾知识：很多时候，自己都是在犯过去同样的错误，通过 Spaced Repetition ，相当于加了一个超级强大的 memo ，就像是动态规划算法，一但做过某个东西，下一次就可以直接拿来用。\nself testing：复习卡片，就是回答问题的过程，这个过程能够增加记忆。\n减少选择：很多时候，我们会面临选择的困境，我们的选择太多会让“选择”这个过程就花费很多时间。Spaced Repetition ，减少了选择，你只需要不断地复习就行了。至于复习哪些内容，算法都帮你解决了。其实，抖音这类 app ，也是利用了这个特点，减少了用户的选择。\n孤立语义，避免 illusion of competence: 我在之前的博客中提到了\nmany students experience illusions of competence when they are studying. “repeatedly read their notes or textbook(despite the limited benefits of this strategy), but relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice while studying”\n很多人不断重复阅读书籍，以为自己什么都会了，但是一考试，却发现实际上还是有很多空缺。这是因为我们对书籍的整体太熟悉造成。要打破这种熟悉，增加单个知识点的连接，就需要孤立每一个知识点，这个可以通过 Spaced Repetition 做到\n从 Anki 到 Obsidian ，我的 Spaced Repetition 经历\n第一次接触到 Spaced Repetition 是通过 Anki ，用了一段时间，发现制作卡片和回顾卡片都太独立，没法整合到笔记系统中。\n后面把笔记系统从 onenote 切换到了 logseq ，发现 logseq 自带的 flashcards 就是 anki 的便捷版本，随后就开始在 logseq 上制作卡片，然后回顾卡片。但是在这个过程中，发现一些 Logseq 的问题，\n比如性能堪忧。当我制作了 500+卡片时，已经很卡顿了。\n功能不全面，有 bug 。比如 flashcard 不具备根据 card-next-schedule 进行排序的功能，由此我还专门提了一个PR 给 Logseq 官方，但是最终还是放弃了。\n最后把笔记从 Logseq 迁移到 Obsidian ，无意间发现obsidian-spaced-repetition这个插件，但是用了一段时间后，发现这个插件有一些功能不满足我的需求，比如制作卡片不灵活，它的\"?\"符号必须在行首且没有空格。不支持 tag 重新排序。等等。\n最后，自己 fork 了一个分支，维护了起来。由于和原仓库改动较大，就没有提 PR 了。目前当作自己在用，而且 README 更新较慢。。\n自己 fork 的分支的链接\n总结\nSpaced Repetition 适合那些需要一生记忆的知识，对我来说，它能够极大地提高我的效率。希望大家读完本文章都能有所收获，找到自己合适的学习方式。",

          "description": "这个问题是我最近做业务开发和业余开发都遇到的，这里的 angle 指的是旋转弧度。不是旋转角度。\n先看一下我使用 angle 的场景吧：\n\n\n\n图一中使用了 canvas.drawArc，传入了 startAngle 和 sweepAngle。图二也是如此。图三是 Flutter ConstraintLayout 中圆形定位的 example，我没有使用 Flutter ConstraintLayout 自带的旋转能力，而是用了 Transform.rotate，传入了 angle。Flutter ConstraintLayout 自带的对 Widget 的旋转能力用了 canvas.rotate，也传入了 angle。\n我现在还没搞明白弧度和角度的对应关系，官网文档中也没有详细说明。但对于我来说，我根本就不想去关心弧度是多少，我只关心角度，这个角度的范围是 [0.0, 360.0]。以图三中的时钟为例，旋转 0.0 或 360.0 度时，指针应该指向 12，旋转 90.0 度时，指针应该指向 3，旋转 180.0 度时，指针应该指向 6，旋转 270.0 度时，指针应该指向 9。\n于是我们需要将旋转弧度转换成旋转角度，我研究出的转换公式如下：\nTransform.rotate：\npi + pi * (angle / 180)\n\ncanvas.rotate：\nangle * pi / 180\n\ncanvas.drawArc：\nstartAngle = -pi / 2\nsweepAngle = angle * pi / 180\n\n看见没有，这三类旋转的转换公式都不一样。我不明白 Flutter 官方为什么要这么设计，为啥这么优秀的 Flutter 引入了这么糟糕的  API。于是我带着气愤给官方提了个 Issue，想喷一喷设计这几个 API 的哥们：\n\n结果我被反杀了。\n冷静下来之后，我决定提交一个 Pull Request 来修正这个 API。但这需要时间，因为提交 Pull Request 的周期很长，上次我提了个 bug，Oppo 的一个哥们修复了它，Pull Request 等了将近两个月才合并。\n好了，今天就讲这么多吧，你以后很可能会遇到需要旋转的场景，赶紧收藏起来吧！我是中国第一位 Android & Flutter 双料 GDFE，欢迎关注我的公众号 FlutterFirst，带你起飞！",

          "description": "Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nIt’s no mystery why Sony made a PC gaming monitor that can also work well with the PS5. The PC gaming business is simply too big to ignore, and it’s just money on the table that’s otherwise up for grabs by other monitor makers. \nSony didn’t say those exact words, but it didn’t have to for me to know that it’s one of the reasons why it decided to announce two gaming monitors this week. Another reason is because Sony’s growing focus on services means that PS Plus will eventually go beyond the console. Getting its games in front of more people instead of locking them down as exclusives has, in the past few years, become a welcome change in strategy. \n\n\nSony is late to this particular party, though.

It’s part first-person shooter, part first-person platformer, part puzzler, part card game, part time attack, and even part visual novel.\nI’ve struggled to come up with a better description, but in an interview, Neon White creative director Ben Esposito finally gave me one: “a really gamey game.”\n“It’s a really unlikely game,” he said. “It’s a really gamey game that’s full of gamey things.

Today it announced the HTC Desire 22 Pro, a follow-up to last year’s HTC Desire 21 Pro, and the company’s big attempt at capitalizing on the so-called metaverse. In the UK, it’s listed at £399 and will ship on August 1st.\nThere are a couple of different aspects to the phone’s metaverse functionality. To start with, it’s designed to be the “perfect companion” to HTC’s recently announced Vive Flow VR headset and used to access Viverse, HTC’s take on the metaverse. The headset is designed to work with any Android phone, though, so it’s not entirely clear what the Desire 22 Pro offers that isn’t available elsewhere. \nContinue reading…",

But as soon as I got my hands on the device on the prior Thursday, it was clear that running down the battery — one of the most important things a laptop reviewer needs to do — was going to be a Whole Thing. \nReader, I tried. I would use the device all evening and leave it running all night, but it would still have plenty of charge left in the morning, and I’d have to plug it in for testing, abandon it to film, or give it to our video and photo teams for shooting before I could fully drain it down. I did not have a long enough interrupted span of time to continuously use the device. That’s how absurdly long this laptop lasts. \nBut, with the written review and the video review both...\nContinue reading…",

This corroborates earlier findings from security research group Lookout, which has linked the spyware, dubbed Hermit, to Italian spyware vendor RCS Labs.\nLookout says RCS Labs is in the same line of work as NSO Group — the infamous surveillance-for-hire company behind the Pegasus spyware — and peddles commercial spyware to various government agencies. Researchers at Lookout believe Hermit has already been deployed by the government of Kazakhstan and Italian authorities. In line with these findings, Google has...\nContinue reading…",

Comprised of her signature sculptures of immense hybrid figures, the largely bronze body of work addresses settler-colonialism and the inextricable tie between people and the land.\nPerpetually evoking nature and mythology to address historical issues of contemporary relevance, Mutu positions women as the most powerful, revering their physical form and highlighting their innate connection to ecology.

Like many Midwestern farm structures, it’s weathered and has seen years of use and repairs, but one recent alteration makes it a standout among its counterparts: a careful cut through the middle of the structure reveals a slice of sky. Conceived by Detroit-based architect and educator Catie Newell, founder of Alibi Studio, the project reworks the iconic framework of an aging farm building to allow light through an unexpected aperture.

The artist tells Colossal that he focuses on achieving the natural shape of a hind leg or tusk first and uses the small impressions to add tactile depth to the creatures, which often appear mid-movement atop their metallic supports.
