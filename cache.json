          "description": "选择一款最中意的文字处理程序把你的想法打印到纸上。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n作家们总是在寻找更好的方法将他们的文字和想法以更好的方式呈现给他们的读者。我对文字处理程序最早的印象是在 Apple II 上使用 AppleWorks 和后来的 FrEDWriter，后者是一个创建于 1985 年的免费文字处理程序。这是我的学生们的标配，他们许多人来自没有钱购买专有软件的家庭。\n\r\nAbiword\n\r\n在 20 世纪 90 年代时，我开始使用 Linux，寻找我可以使用的高质量的写作程序，并推荐给跟随我进入开源软件世界的学生们。我首先接触的文字处理程序是 AbiWord。AbiWord 来自西班牙语 Abierto，意思是“开放”。它最早发布于 1998 年，并且之后一直在升级。它使用 GPLv2 开源协议。它支持列表、缩进，字符格式等基本功能，支持 .doc、.html、.docx、.odt 等多种格式文件的导入和导出。\n\r\n\n\r\nEtherpad\n\r\nEtherpad 是一个开源协作编辑项目。它可以让你像 Google Drive 那样实时编辑文档，主要的区别是它是完全开源的。据它的网站上介绍，你可以“与你的朋友、同学或同事一起写文章、新闻稿、待办事项，同时在同一个文件上工作”。其源代码可随时查看。Etherpad 采用 Apache 2.0 开源协议。你可以直接在线使用它，或者把它下载并 安装 到你的 Linux 电脑上。\n\r\nCryptpad\n\r\nCryptPad 是一个端到端加密的写作套件。使用 GPLv3 开源协议，并且源代码公开在 GitHub 上。它由 Xwiki 实验室开发。可替代 Google Drive，并且是自主托管的。根据其网站描述，“CryptPad 旨在实现协作办公。实时同步文档的更改。由于所有数据都已加密，因此该服务及其管理员无法查看正在编辑和存储的内容。” Cryptpad 为用户提供了 丰富的文档。\n\r\nFocuswriter\n\r\nFocusWriter 是一个简单的免干扰的编辑器。它使用隐藏式界面，鼠标移动到屏幕边界时才显示界面。它使用 GPLv3 开源协议，并为 Linux 提供了 Flatpak 软件包，也为 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 提供了 DEB 和 RPM。下图是一个 FocusWriter 桌面的例子。这是一个非常简单直观的界面，菜单自动隐藏，当鼠标指向屏幕顶部或边缘时才会显示。文件默认保存为 .odt 格式，也支持纯文本、.docx 和富文本。\n\r\n\n\r\nLibreOffice Writer\n\r\nLibreOffice Writer 是我最喜欢的，我已经使用了十多年了。它拥有我需要的所有特性，包括富文本格式化。它还拥有我见过的最多的导入、导出方式。类似于 APA 这样的问卷和出版模板它拥有十多种。我最喜欢的是它可以将文件导出为 PDF 和 epub。 LibreOffice Writer 是一个自由软件，使用 Mozilla 公开许可证（MPL）2.0 开源协议。其 源代码 由文档基金会提供。LibreOffice 支持大多数 Linux 发行版。同时它也提供 Flatpak、Snap 和 AppImage 软件包。另外，你也可以把它下载并安装到 MacOS 和 Windows 上。\n\r\n\n\r\nOpenOffice Writer\n\r\nApache OpenOffice Writer 是一个全功能的文字处理程序。它可以简单地用于备忘录，也可以复杂到足以编写你的第一本书。依据官网的描述，OpenOffice Writer 将文档自动保存为 .odt。它还支持将文档保存为 .doc、.docx、富文本和其他格式。OpenOffice Writer 使用 Apache 许可证 2.0 开源协议。源代码在 GitHub 上公开。\n\r\n还有许多自由开源软件等着大家去发现。它们非常适合完成你的日常任务，你也可以为它们的发展做出贡献。你最喜欢的 Linux 文字处理器程序是什么呢？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/6/word-processors-linux\n\r\n作者：Don Watkins 选题：lkxed 译者：duoluoxiaosheng 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Linus Torvalds 发布了用来测试的 Linux 内核 5.19 RC1，带来了一些重大变化。\n\r\n\r\n继上个月 Linux 内核 5.18 发布之后，Linus Torvalds 宣布了 Linux 内核 5.19 系列第一个候选版本。与此同时，Linux 内核 5.19 官方合并窗口关闭，这意味着除非是关键性的，否则不会再接受任何新功能。\n\r\n简单看一下 Linux 内核 5.19 的新内容，会发现 CPU、GPU、网络、存储和核心模块都有常规的更新。此外，代码清理、淘汰过时硬件和对以后芯片组的持续支持是此版本的亮点。\n\r\n在进一步介绍之前，让我们简单来看一下这些新特性。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19（RC1）的新特性\n\r\nCPU\n\r\n首先需要提及的是，Linux 内核 5.19 开始 初步支持 龙芯架构的 CPU 系列。龙芯由中国龙芯中科公司设计开发。龙芯架构的 CPU 是兼容 MIPS 架构的通用微处理器。不过虽然现在提供了支持，但是你仍不能在龙芯 CPU 上启动 Linux，因为一些代码还在审核中。希望在 5.20 版本中能够使用。\n\r\n新的 英特尔 IFS 驱动 在该版本中落地，这有助于在部署前后发现硬件问题。它能够在早期阶段检测电路层面的 CPU 错误。\n\r\n在前几个针对英特尔 CPU 的内核版本中一直在对电源管理和散热方面进行开发，这个版本 也不例外。首先，为 Raptor 和 Alder Lake 家族添加了英特尔 运行时平均功率限制Run-Time Average Power Limiting（RAPL）的支持。其次，改进了 P-state 驱动以处理频率变化，并且基于 CPU 的缩放支持被添加到被动 devfreq 中。\n\r\n虽然英特尔 CPU 主要是散热和电源管理方面的工作，但对 AMD CPU 系列来说有更多的性能更新。首先，计划在今年年底完成 ZMD Zen 4 CPU 的 基于指令的采样Instruction-Based Sampling（IBS）模块引入了更多更新。此外，此版本引入了 PerfMonV2，提供了更多性能监视能力。\n\r\n此外，该版本中移除了 a.out 支持。同样，过时的 Renesas H8/300 CPU 也被移除了。\n\r\n主要 ARM 更新\n\r\n终于，主线 Linux 内核能够 支持 ARM 多平台 了。在 Linus 的 RC1 开场白中可以看到，这是该版本中的巨大改变！从 Linux 3.7 开始，跨越了十多年的工作，这是多么漫长的过程。\n\r\n\n\r\n图形和存储升级\n\r\n存储子系统在各种流行的文件系统中都有性能提升。最主要的变化包括苹果 M1 NVMe 控制器支持和对 XFS 文件系统的更好支持。此外，Btrfs、F2FS 以及 exFAT 文件系统也有增强。\n\r\n在代码行数方面，有一个令人兴奋的指标是仅是图形驱动程序 Linux 内核 5.19 就增加了大约50 万行代码。它包括 AMD 的 RDNA、CDNA，英特尔的 Raptor Lake、DG2/Alchemist 等图形驱动更新。\n\r\n重要的网络变化\n\r\n鉴于数据传输大幅增长，对 Big TCP 的支持有助于支持数据中心 400 GBit 级别的流量。它还可以在高性能网络环境中降低延迟。\n\r\n继续改进了 多路径 TCPMulti-Path TCP（MPTCP）。此外，高通 ath11k WiFi 驱动程序在此版本中添加了网络唤醒功能。同样增加了对瑞昱的 8852ce 芯片、联发科的 T700 调制解调器以及瑞萨科技的 RZ/V2M 的支持。\n\r\n其他值得注意的功能\n\r\n首先，内核中著名的随机函数生成器（RNG）在此版本中 继续 改进。\n\r\n其次，著名的新兴的 Framework 模块化笔记本电脑获得了此版本 Chrome OS EC 驱动支持。Framework 笔记本现在可以作为一个非 Chromebook 设备利用 ChromeOS 的嵌入式控制器。\n\r\n此外，Wacom 绘画板以及其他相关设备也有众多更新。包括 对联想 Thinkpad TrackPoint II、谷歌 Whiskers Touchpad、联想 X12 TrackPoint 等设备支持的提升。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19 下载\n\r\n如果你想要测试并尝试该候选版本，可以在 这里 下载。\n\r\n预计在 2022 年 7 月左右最终版本发布前，将会有多个版本更迭。\n\r\n参考自：内核邮件列表\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2022/06/linux-kernel-5-19-rc1/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：Donkey-Hao 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "GitHub 正式宣布终止 Atom 项目\n\r\nGitHub 是在 2011 年宣布 Atom，2015 年 5 月发布了 1.0 版本，并吸引了数百万开发者使用。而微软在 2015 年推出的 VS Code 也是受到了 Atom 的启发。在 2018 年微软收购 GitHub 后，Atom 成为了微软的项目。在社区对 Atom 前景的担忧之下，GitHub 承诺不会放弃 Atom。但过去几年 Atom 除了安全更新外几乎没有什么改进。而 Atom 和 VS Code 的用户数此消彼长，Stack Overflow 的 2021 年度开发者调查结果表明，仅 13% 开发者将 Atom 当做主力开发环境，而 VS Code 却高达 71%。最后，Atom 还留下了一个重要遗产，它所分拆出来的 Electron 框架被数以千计的应用广泛使用，其中包括 VS Code、Slack 和 GitHub Desktop 等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GitHub\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实可以想到，当年社区对 GitHub 被收购的担忧并非无的放矢。可惜了 Atom，至今我还对 Atom 1.0 那时候的那个 宣传视频 记忆尤深。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIETF 正式颁布 HTTP/3 推荐标准 RFC 9114\n\r\n作为超文本传输协议的第三个大版本，它确定了 QUIC 包含的 HTTP/2 功能，并描述了如何将 HTTP/2 扩展迁移至 HTTP/3。QUIC 全称为“快速 UDP 互联网连接”，由谷歌创建并于 2013 年发布。其旨在化解 TCP 需要多次来回握手，才能建立连接并开始传输数据的短板。早在 IETF 颁布 HTTP/3 的意见征求稿前，谷歌就已经将 QUIC 支持内嵌于 Chrome 浏览器，并在谷歌的诸多服务上启用。Web 流量观测表明 HTTP/3 的流量已超过 HTTP/1.1。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我记得 HTTP/2 也不过才几年，现在都要开始普及 HTTP/3。真是风水轮流转，谁想到最主要的互联网应用 HTTP 最终会从 TCP 转向 UDP 呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌再次打破圆周率计算纪录，计算出百万亿位\n\r\n早在 2019 年，谷歌云服务就已经打破了圆周率的计算纪录，计算出了 31.4 万亿位。周三，谷歌云再次宣布打破了百万亿位的圆周率计算纪录。这 百万亿位圆周率 的最后 10 位是：30952 95560。谷歌云表示，其借助计算引擎服务完成了本次新挑战，用到了 N2 机器家族、虚拟网卡、100 Gbps 网络带宽，以及平衡持久磁盘等新功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：谷歌\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看似无用的圆周率计算，其实是谷歌云一次炫技的展示。有人说，任何大小的数字都能在圆周率的某个片段找到。不说百万亿位了，你能背出多少位圆周率呢？",

          "description": "编译软件在你如何运行你的系统方面给你很大的灵活性。LD_LIBRARY_PATH 变量，以及 GCC 的 -L 和 -l 选项，是这种灵活性的组成部分。\n\r\n\r\n编译软件是开发者经常做的事情，在开源世界中，一些用户甚至选择自己动手。Linux 播客 Dann Washko 称源码为“通用包格式”，因为它包含了使一个应用在任何平台上运行所需的所有组件。当然，并不是所有的源码都是为所有的系统编写的，所以它只是在目标系统的子集内是“通用”的，但问题是，源码是非常灵活的。有了开源，你可以决定代码的编译和运行方式。\n\r\n当你在编译代码时，你通常要处理多个源文件。开发人员倾向于将不同的类或模块放在不同的文件中，这样它们可以被单独维护，甚至可能被不同的项目使用。但当你编译这些文件时，许多文件会被编译成一个可执行文件。\n\r\n这通常是通过创建共享库来完成的，然后从可执行文件中动态链接回它们。这样可以通过保持模块化功能的外部性来保持可执行文件的小型化，并确保库可以独立于使用它们的应用而被更新。\n\r\n在编译过程中定位一个共享对象\n\r\n当你 用 GCC 编译 时，你通常需要在你的工作站上安装一个库，以便 GCC 能够定位到它。默认情况下，GCC 假定库在系统库路径中，例如 /lib64 和 /usr/lib64。然而，如果你要链接到一个你自己的尚未安装的库，或者你需要链接到一个没有安装在标准位置的库，那么你必须帮助 GCC 找到这些文件。\n\r\n有两个选项对于在 GCC 中寻找库很重要：\n\r\n\r\n-L（大写字母 L）在 GCC 的搜索位置上增加一个额外的库路径。\n\r\n-l（小写字母 L）设置你要链接的库的名字。\n\r\n\r\n例如，假设你写了一个叫做 libexample.so 的库，并且你想在编译你的应用 demo.c 时使用它。首先，从 demo.c 创建一个对象文件：\n\r\n$ gcc -I ./in…",

          "description": "机器学习基本上是人工智能的一个子集，它使用以前存在的数据对新数据进行预测。\n\r\n\r\n当然，现在我们所有人都知道这个道理了！这篇文章展示了如何将 Python 中开发的机器学习模型作为 Java 代码的一部分来进行预测。\n\r\n\n\r\n本文假设你熟悉基本的开发技巧并理解机器学习。我们将从训练我们的模型开始，然后在 Python 中制作一个机器学习模型。\n\r\n我以一个洪水预测模型为例。首先，导入以下库：\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\n\r\n当我们成功地导入了这些库，我们就需要输入数据集，如下面的代码所示。为了预测洪水，我使用的是河流水位数据集。\n\r\nfrom google.colab import files\r\nuploaded = files.upload()\r\nfor fn in uploaded.keys(): \r\n    print('User uploaded file \"{name}\" with length {length} bytes'.format(name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))\r\n\n\r\n如果没有选择文件的话，选择上传的文件。\n\r\n只有在当前浏览器会话中执行了该单元格时，上传部件才可用。请重新运行此单元，上传文件 Hoppers Crossing-Hourly-River-Level.csv，大小 2207036 字节。\n\r\n完成后，我们就可以使用 sklearn 库来训练我们的模型。为此，我们首先需要导入该库和算法模型，如图 1 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\nregressor = LinearRegression()\r\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\n\r\n完成后，我们就训练好了我们的模型，现在可以进行预测了，如图 2 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Java 中使用 ML 模型\n\r\n我们现在需要做的是把 ML 模型转换成一个可以被 Java 程序使用的模型。有一个叫做 sklearn2pmml 的库可以帮助我们做到这一点：\n\r\n# Install the library\r\npip install sklearn2pmml\r\n\n\r\n库安装完毕后，我们就可以转换我们已经训练好的模型，如下图所示：\n\r\nsklearn2pmml(pipeline, ‘model.pmml’, with_repr = True)\r\n\n\r\n这就完成了！我们现在可以在我们的 Java 代码中使用生成的 model.pmml 文件来进行预测。请试一试吧！\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：Java 中有第三方库 jpmml/jpmml-evaluator，它能帮助你使用生成的 model.pmml 进行预测。）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/05/using-a-machine-learning-model-to-make-predictions/\n\r\n作者：Jishnu Saurav Mittapalli 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这是一张我一直珍藏在手机里的照片，2017 年，少数派很荣幸的被邀请到美国现场参见 WWDC 大会，并参与了 Apple 设计奖的颁奖和报道，作为一个名不见经传的小媒体来说确实难得，也算是对我们前五年坚持推荐优质付费应用的一个小小认可。\n\n从这一年开始，一张图看懂 WWDC 就成了我们的招牌菜，用最简洁、最漂亮的设计，诠释大会关键信息，别小看这一张图，都是在半夜三点到六点之间做完的，通常都要两三个同事一起熬通宵，我虽然不参与设计，也会尽量陪着，做一些社交传播工作。\n也就是这一次，我才了解到苹果设计奖的一些标准关键词：Usability（易用性）、Design（设计）、Innovation （创新），Technology（技术应用）。而我们在 2014 年，就基于用户的角度，总结了少数派报道和推荐产品的四个标准关键词：「原创，优美，实用，有趣」，并把它们标注在网站的页脚。\n\n我没想到两个标准会有这么高的重合度，虽然看起来非常的巧合，但实际上，这是平台方希望保持「用户角度」的相同初心。这几个字说起来简单，但面对商业世界就非常的不容易。因为要坚持这样的推荐报道原则，我们放弃了很多广告投放的机会，商业化进展缓慢，终于在用完第一笔投资之后，进入严重的经营困难，不得不大幅收缩团队，转型拓展。而这个痛苦阶段，就在我们第一次受邀参加 WWDC 大会的一个月之后。\n现实就是如此，台前的辉煌不一定被看到，但幕后的痛苦你一个也躲不掉。\n\n从 2017 到 2019 年，少数派连续三次被邀请到美国现场报道 WWDC，随着经验丰富，我们也做了更多的准备。2019 年现场采访了很多开发者，录制了一些现场视频，那一年，我们刚刚建立视频内容小组，开始拓展一些新的形式。虽然拍摄和剪辑比较稚嫩，但内容还算是干货满满。\n随后两年，疫情来了，WWDC 也都改成了线上录播，虽然缺少了线下的仪式感，但我们还是保持着熬夜报道和制作一图流的习惯。对于我这个四十出头的中年人来说，熬一次夜还是挺伤身的，但这既是工作，也是爱好，痛并快乐着。\n近两年，随着智能手机销量的下降，国产品牌的追赶，WWDC 的关注度似乎也在减退，因为用户希望看到更多惊喜，而现实是硬件和应用创新都进入了瓶颈期。这次 WWDC 2022，苹果生态的价值开始被展现出来，四个大的 OS 都基本完善了，开始进行相互打通，比如 iPhone 和 Mac 电脑的相机协同，比如 macOS 的台前调度被整合到 iPadOS，还有深度调用车机信息的全新 CarPlay，这里不是简单的把设备捏在一块，而是基于用户的场景需求，提供最佳的组合方案，多年构建的生态壁垒又一次拉开了苹果与其他对手的距离。\n但回想一下，苹果这个生态是怎么来的呢？首先你不能跟风，而是要站在用户的角度，去做未来的布局；其次你不能贪婪，要放弃短期利益，去构建长期的用户信任；最后你不能偷懒，要保证每一个产品和服务的体验，不断累加产品力。除了这些基础的工作，还要应对开发者关系、投资者收益、供应链管理等一系列的考验，所以具有壁垒的生态不是喊出来的，是一步一步做出来的。\n\n一转眼，五年又过去了，很庆幸少数派还在，并且建立了基础的商业闭环，而苹果已经成为了全球最具价值的公司，我们也又一次参与了 WWDC 和苹果设计奖的采访报道。这五年里，很多外部事物都变了，但更多底层的东西并没有变。",

          "description": "为什么要这么做？\n昨天在推上看到一个视频，注意到他是使用 Sony ZV1 作为直播摄像头的。而作为一个视频制作者，我的不少视频都是以真人 + 教程的形式提供给我的观众的，我突然想起来，或许我可以使用手机来作为摄像头来完成视频的录制。\n和 MBP 自带的摄像头相比，可以让我在视频中更加清晰、更加明亮，让我的视频的观众们可以更好的看到我（没错，就是这么自恋）。于是，我决定用我的备用机 — Pixel 6 来完成这个操作。\n为什么是 Iriun Webcam\nIriun Webcam 的一个好处是免费版可以使用 4K，且免费版的水印也十分的不明显，对于白嫖用户十分友好。如果你需要完全去除水印或更加强大的控制能力，则可以付费获得。不过对于绝大多数场景，免费版足矣。\n所需软件\n\nmacOS 驱动下载：https://iriun.com/\nAndroid Play Store 应用：https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacksoftw.webcam\niOS App Store 应用：https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iriun-webcam-for-pc-and-mac/id1439303579?mt=8\n\n所需硬件\n\n与手机适配的 USB 数据线：如果本地网络速度足够快，也可以不使用数据线。不过我推荐你使用 USB 数据线，主要是理论上会更加的稳定。\n\n操作流程\n安装软件\nPC 端\n想要实现软件连接，需要先下载安装相应的软件。Iriun Webcam 支持 WIndows 、 macOS 和 Ubuntu ，你只需要访问其官网，并下载对应的软件，并在本地进行安装即可\n\n手机端\n手机端则可以在你的手机上搜索 Irirun webcam，并进行安装。\n\n配置设备连接\n安装完成后，在 macOS 上打开 Iriun Webcam 会看到如下的界面，此时说明你的 PC 已经准备好了。\n\n未连接状态的效果\n在手机上打开同样的软件，稍等片刻，二者就会自动连接到一起\n\n已连接状态的效果\n换用 USB 连接\n使用 Wi-Fi 连接的最大的问题是不稳定，以及延迟高。因此，你可以选择改用 USB 数据线进行连接，从而获得一个更低的延迟和更稳定的视频效果。\n你需要先将自己的手机开启开发者选项，并开启「USB 调试」，随后将手机与电脑连接（如果有授权窗口，则授权 PC 进行调试）。\n\n授权完成后，稍等片刻软件就会自动刷新，手机后的「Wi-Fi」变为「USB」，则说明你已经成功切换为使用 USB 连接。\n\n配置软件摄像头\n当你配置完成 Iriun 的 Webcam 之后，就可以在你日常使用的软件当中切换具体使用的摄像头为 Iriun Webcam 来获得从手机取得的视频画面。\n\n腾讯会议的摄像头选择框\n如果你使用 OBS 的话，还可以将音频输入修改为 Iriun Webcam audio （腾讯会议并不支持），来获取手机当中传递过来的音频信号。\n\n总结\n使用手机摄像头来替代 Mac Book Pro 上自带的摄像头可以帮助我们获得一个更好的画质和视频观看体验。相比于购买一个全新的摄像头，不妨用上你的旧手机来完成你的直播诉求。而你所需要的，不过是一款免费软件 + 一根 USB 数据线。",

These two types of libraries vary in terms of how they are created and linked. Your choice of which to use depends on your use case.\nIn a previous article, I demonstrated how to create a dynamically linked executable, which is the more commonly used method.
