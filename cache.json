          "description": "Sometimes when you're running a Lighthouse performance check on your sites, you might come across the issue:\n<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute\n\nLuckily, this is a pretty easy thing to fix, whether you're using Next.js, or plain ol' HTML!\nIt's for accessibility! Screen readers often use a different sound library for each language they support. They can easily switch between those sound libraries, but only when a webpage specifies which language to use.\nTypically in your average Next.js website, the deployed page ships only a <html> wrapped site, with no language attribute attached.\nIf you were writing a plain HTML website (or using some other library that allows you to update the shipped HTML files), it would be a simple matter of adding a lang=\"en\" to your outputted HTML, like so:\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\nWith Next.js, it's a little bit more involved, but luckily not too difficult!\nInside of your pages/ directory (or wherever you put your page components), make a file called _document.js. This overrides the default document that is shipped with your Next.js site. Don't worry though, we won't break anything!\nInside of that file, add the following:\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang=\"en\"> {/* Add whichever language you want here */}\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n\nBoom, you're done! Make sure you don't delete the Html, Head, Main, and NextScript components, because they are required for your site to be properly rendered. Now, next time you run your performance and accessibility audits, your language settings should be in the clear!",

          "description": "I am 31 years old and I didn't knew this. Everytime I wanted to scrape some data table from a website I had to run a script to do it for me, when in fact it was so easy... like a walk in a park.\nLet's have a brief example of what I mean. So how do you go from this...\n\nto this...\n\n... in less than 10 seconds.\nAll you need is the page you want to get the data from, in my case it's this one, and the  Excel app opened (you can use Google drive as well).\nWe will use the IMPORTXML function which takes as parameters an url, an xpath_query and a locale. All we need is to pass the url and the xpath_query of the table.\nOur single line of code will look like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//tr\")\n\n\nSo basically we are telling the program to fetch any table row from the page and display it in our sheet. Easy, right?\nRemember that you can modify the xpath_query to fetch anything from the page.  For example, if I want to fetch the 22nd row of the table I change the function like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//table[1]/tbody/tr[24]\")\n\nIsn't it awesome? I bet it is. Hope you've learned something! :)",

We do run into the case of repeated numerals causing an issue III, but we can clear that by multiplying num by any number between 2 and 4 before comparing it to res, since the numerals jump in value by 5x.\nOnce we know how to properly identify a subtractive numeral, it's a simple matter to just iterate in reverse through given numeral to find and return the res.\nfunction romanToInt(s: string): number {\n  let res: number = 0;\n  const symbols = {\n    I: 1,\n    V: 5,\n    X: 10,\n    L: 50,\n    C: 100,\n    D: 500,\n    M: 1000,\n  };\n  s.split(\"\")\n    .reverse()\n    .forEach((char) => {\n      let val: number = parseInt(symbols[char]);\n      if (res > 4 * val) {\n        res -= val;\n      } else {\n        res += val;\n      }\n    });\n  return res;\n}\n\nThis solution uses a lookup table composed which can help in easier conversion and much simple compared to the above one.\nfunction intToRoman(num: number): string {\n  let res:string = \"\";\n  const value:number [] = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];\n  const numerals:string [] = [\"M\",\"CM\",\"D\",\"CD\",\"C\",\"XC\",\"L\",\"XL\",\"X\",\"IX\",\"V\",\"IV\",\"I\"]\n  for (let i = 0; num; i++)\n    while (num >= value[i]){\n        res += numerals[i];\n         num -= value[i];\n    }\n  return res;\n}\n\nHere I have tried to solve them in typescript using ts-problems repo.\n🔁 original post at 🔗 Dev Post",

Today, we're going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.\nOf course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we're going to worry about creating the actual spinner!\n\nFor this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).\nWe start with just a very simple structure in our html.\n<div class=\"spinner\">\n  <img src=\"./rainbow.png\" class=\"img\"/>\n</div>\n\nTip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.\nTo create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we'll create a keyframe animation called spin:\n @keyframes spin {\n   0% {\n     transform: rotate(0deg);\n   }\n   100% {\n     transform: rotate(360deg);\n   }\n }\n\nNow, let's style our actual spinner!\n\nWe created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:\n .spinner {\n   height: 100vh;\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n }\n\nNow, for the actual image:\n .img {\n   height: 150px;\n   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;\n }\n\nNow we have a working spinner!\nWant to see the full tutorial? Watch the YouTube video below or watch in on CodeCast to get access to all the code in the Player!\n\n\n\n\nFor more of my content, follow me on like Twitter & CodeCast! \nYou can also read my last blog here:\nCreate A Portfolio Website with only HTML & CSS\nAmy Oulton ・ Jan 13 ・ 4 min read\n#html\n        #css\n        #webdev\n        #codenewbie\n      \n.",

          "description": "春节假期结束了，不知道大家这个年过得怎么样？在疫情下，春节热闹十足的场面似乎已成了我们记忆里的宝藏。同样深埋在记忆里的，还有那些经典老片。\n得益于电影工作者近年来的努力，曾经那些耳熟能详的经典电影现在很多都有了 4K 修复版。这些影片当中既包括红色经典影片，又包括动画片，还包括一些体育片、歌舞片。部分经典电影的 4K 修复版可以在网上观看，比如西瓜视频推出的 西瓜视频大风车小剧场 中有很多修复版的经典动画片；而另一部分则已经在院线上映，观众可以至影院观看。\n当然，对于那些对经典影片情有独钟的观众，网易也有一个 公版影像典藏计划，目前该计划收集了中外 613 条影像内容。感兴趣的朋友也可以移步直接观看原版。\n电影修复的老手艺与新科技\n电影是第七艺术，其原理是利用了视觉暂留现象。在电影中，那些看似连续的画面实则是由一帧帧单独的照片组成，这一帧帧单独的照片构成了（下文中将会提到的）电影修复的基础。在人类迈向数字时代以前，胶片是记录电影的载体。无论是早期的无声电影，还是后期的有声电影，都是用电影胶片记录的。\n摄影机、电影《蝴蝶之舞》胶片与胶卷放映机。左一来自 UNsplash，其他来自维基百科\n电影胶片对环境的要求比较苛刻。绝大部分胶片的存储环境并不理想，导致其使用寿命大大缩短，并容易产生一系列的问题，比如「齿孔收缩、酸化、划痕、霉斑、药膜脱落」等。不知道你有没有留意过，童年村口大荧幕上的电影画面总是充满了斑驳与闪烁。（这种印象之深，以至于认为电影本该如此。）而实际上，这就是胶片电影在存放、使用与流转过程中发生的胶片受损。\n老电影 修复 通常包括三个阶段：物理修复、数字扫描和数字修复。这里拣着感兴趣的点，我们一起来围观一下。\n物理修复\n我们先从胶片的物理修复看起。胶片的物理修复是一门老手艺。套用一句话「我在故宫修文物」，即「我在电影制片厂修胶片」。\n浓浓的醋味\n大致从 1909 年…",

          "description": "随着人们卫生意识的提高，人们越发重视「菊花」的清洁，市场上兼具清洁、烘干、加热功能的智能马桶也渐渐普及。便后冲洗，洗去残留的粪便，还带烘干，保证了肛周的干燥环境，这是人类在便后清洁这件事上的大进步。\n但显然，并不是每个家庭中都有条件配备自动冲洗马桶，对于租房者来说，换装智能马桶盖的机会可能也没有。至于公共场所，就更难以寻得良厕。如此一来，想要呵护菊花、远离疾病，湿厕纸就成了方便快捷的不二之选。\n「菊花」带来的问题\n粪便是脏的，这是一个再浅显不过的常识。打小家长就教导我们，每次如厕之后都要擦干净，不然会生病。屁股擦不干净，粪便有残留，里面的细菌自然就容易滋生繁殖，进而引起疾病，甚至出现反复，比如胃肠道疾病，以及肛周疾病如肛周脓肿等。\n正常情况，人体排出的粪便中 1/3 到 2/3 的固体成分都是肠道菌群，这些是共生在我们的肠道中，辅助我们消化吸收的「益生菌」，比如乳酸菌、消化性球菌、消化链球菌等等。而当人体本身患有胃肠道疾病时，粪便中便可能携带有害的细菌，即致病菌、病原菌。\n粪便中常见的病原菌有引起痢疾的志贺菌属、引起食物中毒或败血症的沙门杆菌、也有致病性大肠杆菌、金黄色葡萄球菌等，都能引起程度不等的胃肠道疾病。早在 2001 年，美国亚利桑那大学的一项研究 发现，平均每条内裤含有 0.1 克的粪便，最高可达 10 克，而如果是一个感染了沙门杆菌的患者，这些残留在内裤的 0.1 克粪便，就可能含有 1 亿到 10 亿的沙门氏菌。致病性肠道细菌又往往通过粪口传播1，残留在粪便中的细菌，极可能会成为疾病传染的源头。\n因此，便后擦干净，不仅是为了我们自己的肛周安全，也是为了身边人的健康着想。\n但是在人类的进化史中，为了方便排便，肛周进化呈现为多褶皱的结构，「菊花」这个形象的代名词也是由此而来。这样褶皱多的菊花样结构也就决定了单纯的干纸擦拭，其实很难完全擦干净，且一旦用力过猛，很容易…",

          "description": "最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。\n但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。\n\n一、带宽进化的历史\n我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。\n56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。\n\n我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。\n后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。\n21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。\n\nADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。\n2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。\n\n从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。\n二、家庭的入户带宽\n现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。\n\n\n申请…",

          "description": "今天，紫川动画第九集开播，猪期待已久的帝都流血夜剧情终于出来了。\n    帝都流血夜是紫川第一部的高潮，也是三兄弟性格展现、人性冲突的一场剧，三人今后的道路和命运都在这一夜被决定了，可以说是紫川第一部里最重要的戏份了。\n    因为故事激烈，猪当年是写得很舒畅的。感谢动画制作团队的用心，将这一幕剧情呈现得很符合猪心意，尤其是将总长参星的狠辣和阴险表现得很到位，将原作里一些遗漏和缺陷的情节也做了弥补，猪很是满意，中午和猪老婆一起美滋滋地看了动画，感觉甚是意得志满。\n     但孔圣人是怎么说的？天下唯女人难缠也！不学无术的猪老婆甚是可恶，看完以后居然大发厥辞，说动画很精彩，但原作写得太粗糙简单，破绽太多！\n这蠢婆娘专门抬杠，差点把猪给气死。\n猪婆娘蠢言论：“这场政变虎头蛇尾，这么简单就被平定了，杨明华是送死来的，他根本就一点胜算都没有，本就不应该发动这场叛乱的！”\n猪：错！在杨明华看来，他的优势很大！\n政变前，帝都的武装力量本来有三部分：中央军，是帝都最大也是最强的武装力量，足有十万兵马，军团长雷迅，是杨明华的亲信；禁卫军，约一万来人，负责总长府的保卫，是忠于总长的；另外还有负责城内秩序的总监察厅宪兵部队，人数也是数千人，是总监察长萧龙统带。至于其他的治部少治安警察在这里基本只有当观众的份了。\n本来，总长紫川参星一直就是靠禁军和监察厅的宪兵，才勉强和掌握中央军的杨明华维持了一个危险的弱势平衡，但政变之前，总监察长萧龙被杨明华拉拢了过去，帝都城内局势陡然失衡，何况杨明华还召来了帝林统带的远东边军呢？在政变前的杨明华看来，自己掌握了帝都城内、城外的三大部队，对付只有万把人的禁军，那简直是飞龙骑脸想输都难，他不动手还等什么？\n杨明华最大的错误，是没看破帝林是紫川参星安插的卧底，还让他统带了关键的远东边军进城，这导致了他最终的失败。\n猪婆娘：“杨明华兵力本身足够，还画蛇添足叫帝林带兵回来干什么？他让中央军直接攻打总长府不就得了？”\n猪：在雷迅统带下，中央军的政治立场是倾向于杨明华一方的，但他们毕竟也是紫川家的军官，要他们主动攻打紫川家的总长府跟禁军厮杀，同时还要背一个弑主的名声，大部分中央军军人是不会愿意的。\n因为中央军和禁军的士兵都是大多出身帝都本地人，大家本乡本土，搞不好沾亲带故的，都是亲戚街坊邻居朋友，干这种造反、沾血又坏名声的事，动员起来是很有难度的。剧情里，紫川秀能稳住中央军不参与叛乱，一个很大的原因就是中央军的军官团本来就有置身事外的强烈意愿。\n但是远东边军就不同了。边军跟帝都老百姓没交情，下得了狠手。在帝都干杀人放火的事他们是毫无压力的。在杨明华的原计划里，帝林带的远东军回来就是当刀子的，而帝都的中央军是用来压阵和事后收拾残局的，两支兵马互相制衡。没料到事与愿违，帝林这把刀子却是捅向了他自己。\n猪婆娘蠢言论：“既然杨明华优势很巨大，他为什么不趁早篡位，要拖那么久？”\n猪：杨明华在帝都城内确实占尽优势，但他一直不敢篡位，主要障碍倒不是总长府里的那万把禁卫军，而是另外两个原因。\n一是元老院。后面的三杰之乱里我们就看到，一个得不到元老会承认和支持的叛逆者，即使能攻下总长府杀了总长，他的处境也会非常艰难的。作为一个老谋深算的政治家，杨明华不能不考虑到后果。\n二是驻守各地的带兵统领，像哥应星、明辉、方劲等人。紫川参星虽然暗弱，但他毕竟还是紫川家明面上的主君，他被弑杀的消息传出去，统领们做出什么反应是难以预估的。所以，杨明华必须要准备好应付他们的暗手以后才能动手。\n也正是因为有着元老院和统领们的支持，紫川参星这个弱势总长才能对上强势的杨明华坚持那么多年。紫川参星和杨明华，他们二人之间有点像洪秀全和杨秀清，洪秀全拥有大势和名分，杨秀清则拥有实力上的优势。二人之间的斗争，谁赢都有可能，胜负也只是一线，不能说哪一方是压倒性优势或者毫无机会的。\n辨了一个中午，最后，杠精猪老婆哑口无言，猪大获全胜，鼻孔朝天。\n总之，对于这一集帝都流血夜，猪是很满意的~~感谢腾讯、铸梦工作室和万维猫动画的兄弟姐妹们，你们出色地复现了原作剧情，表达了猪的想法，让猪当年梦想的世界和故事得以活灵活现地呈现出来，与喜欢的读者们一同分享！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n老猪先生\n点击下载\n3 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价国产动画《紫川》首创隐藏互动剧集？\n《佣兵天下》可不可以做成系列动漫，对此，大家有什么看法？",

          "description": "“帝都流血夜”在原著《紫川》中，是一段非常重要且深刻的剧情，杨明华蛰伏多年，终于在认为自己有把握的时候露出了自己的獠牙。编剧在改编这段的时候和我们讨论了很久，他们建议能把杨明华的整条阴谋计划拉满，因为反派能力越强，才能显示主角们扭转乾坤的不易。[正义总能打倒邪恶.jpg] \n但那样会对原著进行大幅度改编，于是我们进行了反复推演，如果我们自己是杨明华， 手握这样一把好牌，我们应该怎么打？是强行夺权逼宫，不顾世人看法？ 还是会给自己扯一面大旗，把自己包装成正义之师？ 再或者……娶了紫川宁，毕竟没有血缘关系。[滑稽.jpg]\n原著中曾经提到“杨明华实在是相貌堂堂——怎么看都象个正直可靠的长者！”但实则““卑鄙到——连把牙刷都不能交他保管！”，足以看出杨明华是一个道貌岸然的人，做事考虑的也会更周全，所以最终我们为他选择了“勤王”的招数：让明羽模仿紫川宁笔迹，再盖上她的私印→让紫川宁昭告天下紫川参星的“罪行”→杨明华带军队前来救驾→事成之后再找机会暗害掉无人保护的紫川宁→紫川家族再无后人，杨明华自然就能上位了。\n而对于最大对手哥应星， 杨明华的计划是：派帝林去领远东军，分散哥应星势力→强行让帝林带远东军队回帝都→军官大会上帝林杀掉哥应星→为平公愤，杨明华“大义灭亲”处决\"刽子手”帝林。 杨明华算计了很多人，但是唯独忽略了紫川参星，这才酿造了自己的悲剧。[事后烟.jpg]\n《紫川》是一部史诗题材作品，里面有很多战争权谋的戏份，为了还原这些，团队进行了很多细致的思考，希望能给到大家一部不一样的动画番剧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n无名\n点击下载\n3 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价国产动画《紫川》首创隐藏互动剧集？\n《佣兵天下》可不可以做成系列动漫，对此，大家有什么看法？",

          "description": "今天除夕，然而今年除夕不是“大年三十”，是“大年廿九”。\n理解这个事情，有几个层次。\n第一层：还有多少“大年廿九”？\n我考察了前后各一个世纪（1920s-2110s）的数据，发现两百年间，有118个“大年三十”、83个“大年廿九”。列表如下：\n“大”表示30天的大月，“小”表示29天的小月\n第二层：为什么会有三十/廿九（大小月）的差别？\n因为月相变化周期（朔望月）的平均长度是29.530588天，不是整数。农历为了确保每个“朔”（新月）都在初一，必须根据实际月相调整每个月的长度，使之取29天或30天。\n当然，你可能意识到了，“平均长度”意味着每个朔望月的长度是可以有变化的。实际上变化范围可以相当大：从不足29.3天到29.8天多，可以浮动半天还多。\n\n第三层：那么大小月是由朔望周期决定的吗？\n不难理解，不只由朔望周期决定。\n假设这个月的新月开始于某天0时，假设这个月的朔望周期是29.5天，那么下一个新月出现在第30天中午12点——也就是说第30天会被定义为下个月初一，本月就只能享有29天，成为小月。\n但如果这个月的新月开始于某天12时之后，下一个新月出现在第31天午夜0时之后，那么第31天才会被定义为下个月初一，本月可以成为拥有30天的“大月”。\n所以，大小月由两个参数决定：本月月初的新月出现在几点，以及本月的朔望周期。如下图所示。\n图中橙色、蓝色点的分界线，就是次月新月刚好卡在第30天、第31天之间的午夜0时的情况。\n\n第四层：为什么“大年三十”比“大年廿九”多？\n按照朔望周期平均29.53天考虑，大月、小月的数量之比应该是53:47～1.13。\n我统计了1921到2121这两个世纪，其中大月有1319个，小月有1167个，1319:1167=1.130，完全符合预期。\n但是，同期的大年三十和大年廿九的比例，却是118:83=1.42，比预期的1.13显著更大，这是为什么呢？\n我画出朔望周期在每年各个月份的分布：\n\n可以看出，年底年初的朔望周期，平均来说比年中的朔望周期要长4个小时——这是因为，地球在1月份到达近日点，绕日公转最快，此时月球需要追更长时间才能到达同样的相位，因此朔望周期较长。\n因此农历十二月，也就有更大的机会分到大月。\n\n总结：\n朔望月的平均长度是29.530588天，但是可以在约29.3到29.8之间浮动。\n农历大小月取决于当月和下月的新月出现在哪天。或者说，取决于当月月初的新月时刻和该月朔望周期。\n虽然大小月的总体比例接近53:47，但是腊月的大小月比例显著较高，可达1.42，因此大年多“三十”，较少“廿九”。\n你明白了吗？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n刘博洋\n点击下载",

          "description": "这并不是微软所承诺的……但也不全是坏事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n2007 年 1 月 30 日，也就是 15 年前，一再延期的 Windows Vista 发布了。\n\r\n我们可以尽情地谈论 Vista 有多糟糕、人们有多讨厌它。它是有史以来最不受欢迎的版本之一，与 Windows ME 一样。但是，你今天运行的随便哪个现代 Windows，它都是 Vista 的后裔。\n\r\nVista 并没有微软像 2000 年承诺的那样，Windows “Whistler” 将合并 Windows 9x 和 Windows NT：这变成了 XP，每个人都记得 XP —— 基本上都是怀念。Windows Blackcomb 是 XP 的计划中的继任者。它从未面世。我们得到的是 Windows Longhorn。\n\r\nBlackcomb 将有一个新的编程模型、一个新的用户界面，以及一个新的数据库驱动的存储引擎，“WinFS”……但它被延期了，然后被删除，最后被取消。\n\r\n谈论 Vista 到底是什么更有意思。摆上货架的是技术上更保守的东西。\n\r\n它有用户访问控制（UAC）：那些恼人的弹出式信息不断要求获得你的许可。（这实际上是微软意识到大部分的 Windows 机器都是独立的，没有连接到域。）\n\r\n它有一个 3D 合成的用户界面，“Aero”，带有透明效果，尽管这确实使它变得有点慢。而当 Windows 7 推出时，人们很喜欢它 —— 所以微软将它从 Windows 8 中剥离了。（指的是外观，而不是合成过程；那仍然存在）。\n\r\n它有一个包含“小部件”的侧边栏，这在 Windows 11 中又出现了。\n\r\n尽管它在五年前就被干掉了，但 Vista 是 Windows 7 的基础。Vista 是 NT 的第 6 版；而 Windows 7 则是 Windows NT 6.1。\n\r\nWindows 7 是经过调整的 Vista，响应速度更快。Windows 8 则是 Vista 2：是 Vista 的平板电脑版（它实际上相当不错）。\n\r\n困难在于，人们已经习惯了台式机和鼠标，所以开始按钮又被迅速恢复了。Windows 8.1 则是 Vista 2.1。\n\r\nWindows 10 是 Vista 3，Metro 现代应用程序被搁置，桌面应用程序再次成为中心。现在，Windows 11 删除了所有那些讨厌的、复杂的、混乱的东西，如垂直侧边栏。\n\r\nVista 是微软放弃其花哨的技术野心而开始简化事物的时候。现在有远见的人已经离开了。Surface 并没有彻底改变这个行业，它只是疏远了 OEM 厂商。\n\r\n15 年过去了，微软仍在对 Vista 进行迭代。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/01/happy_birthday_windows_vista/ \n\r\n作者：Liam Proven in Prague 选题：wxy 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

I wrote a comic last week called “life of a DNS query” that explains how\nDNS resolvers work.\nIn this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way –\nwith a short Go program that does the same thing described in the comic.\nThe main function (resolve) is actually just 20 lines, including comments.\nI usually find it easier to understand things work when they come in the form\nof programs that I can run and modify and poke at, so hopefully this program\nwill be helpful to some of you.\nThe program is here: https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver/blob/main/resolve.go\nwhat’s a DNS resolver?\nWhen your browser needs to make a DNS query, it asks a DNS resolvers. When\nthey start, DNS resolvers don’t know any DNS records (except the IP addresses\nof the root nameservers). But the…",

We'll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.\nSummary Of Changes\nLeft, re-wrote documentation, redesigned the UX for save-as/open-as.\nOrca, re-wrote documentation, and added the operators manual on launch.\nThousand Rooms, released 3 new languages: Polish, Hungarian and Serbian. Now offering book as an ePUB.\nUxn, re-wrote entire documentation, and started a project devlog.\nNasu, improved zoom tool, it is now possible to move between tiles(Masto) while zoomed.\nYufo, released a small game for the Virtual Pet Jam.\n100r, added new page: cast-iron cookware, and updated medical.\nNews\nOn January 28th Uxn turned 1 year old! We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed code, ideas, time and laughs to help this project grow into what it is now. It was a wonderful year for smol ordinators. See an image that Rekka made for uxn's birthday.\nWe finally released versions of the Uxn emulator for all major systems(Linux, OS X and Windows), with the option of a version bundled with a few starter roms. We simplified the guide too, to make it easier to install and use.\nOur lion's mane mushroom grew another full head, we harvested it and made some mushroom pakoras.\nIn other news, Devine was interviewed on Anonradio, listen to it here. Also, Compudanzas released an Introduction to Uxn Programming book, with a foreword by Devine.\nPino book club\nWe're reading The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino, and The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity by David Graeber.\nContinue Reading",
