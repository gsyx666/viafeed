Next, create the induvial routes inside the  component.\nreturn (\n    <Router>\n      <Routes>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n        <Route exact path=\"start\" element={<Start />} />\n      </Routes>\n    </Router>\n)\n\nFor each route, we have the path and the element props, these tell the path on the address bar and the component to be rendered out respectively. The exact prop ensures that the *location.pathname * will match exact location path.\nLets say we want to render a component only if a state is true for example if a user is logged in, we can do that like this:\n<Route\n  exact\n  path=\"start\"\n  element={\n    loggedIn ? (\n      <Start />\n    ) : (\n      <Navigate replace to={\"/\"} />\n    )\n  }\n/>\n\nBasically here we are checking if the loggedIn state is true. If it is, we return the Start component, however if it is false, we redirect the user to the homepage using the Navigate element.\nThe replace prop simply replaces the current location with the given path instead of adding on to it.\nThanks for reading!",

But today our team has stepped into a new evolution.\nCryptum (CCM)?\n\n\nCryptum is the first cryptocurrency running on the CCNet network. CCNet (Cryptum Cyber Network) is a large network running on a single server. To use Cryptum, other computers must connect to a server with a CCNet network. Transactions in Cryptum are public and stored in the database of the CCNet network. Cryptom has SRDB (Sender Receiver Data Base) protocol for transactions. Transactions work based on this protocol.\nThe main advantage of Cryptum over other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is that transactions can be carried out like a simple transfer through the \"LiteFast\" function. For example, transactions in other cryptocurrencies sometimes have to wait for hours. Cryptum does not have this problem.\nIn order to mine cryptum coins in Cryptum, your computer needs to run a digital algorithm. The digital algorithm does not allow your computer to mine 0.5 CCM or more.",

The popular ones include\nMermaid - A diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions. Supports drawing of Flowchart, Sequence Diagram, Graphs, Class Diagrams, ER Diagrams and much more\nGraphviz - A graph visualisation software to represent structural information as a diagram of abstract graphs and networks\nDitaa - a small command-line utility written in Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art \nPlantUML - A component that allows to write Sequence diagram, Usecase diagram, Class diagram, Object diagram, Activity diagram, Component diagram, Deployment diagram, State diagram, Timing diagram and more\nBlockDiag - A Group of projects that has other diagramming tools - BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag\nThe list goes on. Almost all of them are open source and free. Each of these tools are written in different programming languages like Mermaid is written in JavaScript, BlockDiag in Python, PlantUML in Java and so on.\nHaving all of them under a single roof does have its advantages, but setting them up and having the prerequisites can be a considerable task. That's where Kroki comes to the rescue. It is both an open source software that can be installed locally and a service that is free as well.\nIt is astonishing to see the support for various diagramming tools all at one place. Kroki provides support for BlockDiag (BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag), BPMN, Bytefield, C4 (with PlantUML), Ditaa, Erd, Excalidraw, GraphViz, Mermaid, Nomnoml, Pikchr, PlantUML, Structurizr, SvgBob, UMLet, Vega, Vega-Lite, WaveDrom. It is constantly updated to add more tools as well.\nThe beauty of Kroki is that it also provides HTTP APIs to create diagrams that can be accessed using tools like cURL. In addition to the services, it also has a CLI - Command Line Interface - that uses kroki.io as the backend.\nTry Kroki for a happy diagramming!",

It will definitely bring a smile on your face 😇.\nHere, We are going to see some easy steps through which you can publish your npm package. For this first you have to build a component that you want to publish. After successfully creating a component just follow the below steps.\nKeep all required files of your component in a single folder let assume it is named as component. \n\n(⚠️All required files of your component must be inside the component folder)\nNow create a index.js file inside this. Refer below image 👇\n\nNow, just import and export your component in index.js file like this 👇\n\n\n\n\nimport your_component_name from './component/your_component_name'\nexport default your_component_name;\n\n(Or, just open this folder with vs code, create a new file named index.js, write these two lines and save it.)\nIf you don't have an npm account just goto npm on your browser and sign up. click here to sign up with npm\n\n\nOpen cmd with in the same folder. Easy way just write cmd at place of your folders path and click enter. Refer below 👇\n\n\n\n\nLogin to npm by this command npm add user\n\n\nNow run this command npm init\n\n\nAfter the above you can see your package.json created over there.\n\n\nIf you have used any third party library then just install them here by which all of these will listed as dependency in your package.json which will help user to get everything installed by a single npm install.\n\n\nNow, create a readme.md describing your component which will be shown in npm.\n\n\nGo back to cmd and run npm publish\n\n\nNow, you can see your package listed in npm.\n\n\n\n🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\nLink to my npm packages\nThank you\nWays to reach me: \nLinkedIn: saurabh satapathy\n\nTwitter: SaurabhSatapat1\n\nGitHub: saurabh190802\n\nEmail: saurabhsatapathy0@gmail.com",

For this page I took a rather conservative approach - making a \"true\" single page (i.e., landing page) that should be as approachable and fast as possible - without sacrificing developer experience.\nSurely, there are right now quite some frameworks and tools out there. But I did not want to spent countless hours learning new stuff just to be blocked by some framework restrictions. Instead, I've chosen an approach that - in my opinion - is quite convenient, super fast, and very lightweight.\nI've chosen to use react as library for writing reusable components. In a nutshell, for the page it allows me to have code like the following:\nfunction Content() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Heade…",

At the end of the day the user needs to like to use your project. So if this is you, maybe it's time to reach out to a designer for a good price.\nRecently I tried fiverr. You may have heard of it.

          "description": "We are happy to announce that GitLive's flagship feature, early merge conflict detection, now works across all branches in VS Code! 🎉 \nWhen we first introduced real-time merge conflict detection, only the changes from each of your teammates’ current branch were shown in the gutter. This meant you could miss a merge conflict from changes in a branch that is not currently being worked on, for instance, changes from a PR waiting for review. Now the change indicators in the gutter of the editor show changes from all branches that contain changes compared to your current branch.\nAnd, as before, and as long as you are not in offline mode, this includes the unpushed changes of your teammates that are also not in offline mode for real-time, instant merge conflict detection!\n\nPreviously you had a simple switch to show or hide the indicators you see in the gutter of the editor. Now, similar to the team window, you can filter the change indicators shown in the gutter of your editor by type.\nIt’s worth noting that these filters are independent of the team window filters, but when you change the team window filters the gutter indicator filters are automatically updated to match (but not vice versa). To open the gutter filters menu, click on the GitLive icon in the upper right corner of VS Code.\n\n🔸 Pushed Changes. Turning off pushed changes will hide the indicators coming from the pushed changes on other branches.\n👉  Both pushed and unpushed changes are on by default, turn both off to hide the indicators completely \nThat’s it for now, we would love to know what you think of these updates and how we can make GitLive better for you, so please reach out via the comments section below.\nDon't have the GitLive extension installed yet? You can find it here, and if want to learn more about the latest release, check out this blog post.",

Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that it allows businesses to scale their operations up or down as needed, without incurring the costs of buying and maintaining their own infrastructure. This can be a huge advantage for businesses that experience seasonal spikes in demand, or that are growing rapidly and need to be able to respond quickly to changes in demand.\nAnother benefit in cloud computing is the ability to quickly deploy new applications and services, This can be a big advantage when businesses need to respond quickly to market changes or new opportunities.\nBusinesses can use cloud computing for a variety of purposes, including storage, backup, recovery, computing, and networking. Storage is one of the most popular uses for the cloud, as it allows businesses to store data offsite and access it from anywhere. \nDespite the fact that enhanced security is not a guarantee, cloud computing still offers a number of advantages in this area. By taking advantage of the security measures offered by cloud providers, businesses can help protect their data and applications from unauthorized access.\nOverall, the benefits of cloud computing are vast and varied. I hope this article has inspired you to take advantage of all the cloud has to offer!\nStar our Github repo and join the discussion in our Discord channel.\nBLST!",

Let's look at the problem first.\nWe need to create the following container by using CSS Properties only:\n\nSo now look at the Solution and how we are going to achieve this. \n<p class=\"left\"></p>\n<p class=\"middle\"></p>\n<p class=\"right\"></p>\n\nNow let's style the containers. \nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  background: #62306d;\n}\n.middle,\n.left,\n.right {\n  position: absolute;\n  background: #f7ec7d;\n  width: 100;\n  height: 100;\n  border-radius: 10rem 10rem 0 0;\n  margin-top: 50;\n}\n.middle {\n  left: 150;\n}\n.left,\n.right {\n  transform: rotate(180deg);\n  bottom: 34;\n}\n.left {\n  left: 50;\n}\n.right {\n  right: 50;\n}\n\nIn CSS Battle you can use 100 instead of 100px. You don't need to define px in CSS. However, if you are using rem or % then you need to pass them separately. That's why in the above CSS code there are no units mostly. For more info visit here  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Alternate Solution\n\n\nThere could be many Alternative Solution I've used this one because of the less characters and simplicity.\n<p l></p>\n<p m></p>\n<p r></p>\n\nHere I am using <p> tag and inside them l stands for left, m stands for middle and r stands for right.\nbody{\n  margin:0;\n  background:#62306D;\n}\np[m],p[l],p[r]{\n  position:absolute;\n  background:#F7EC7D;\n  width:100;\n  height:100;\n  border-radius:10rem 10rem 0 0;\n  margin-top:50;\n}\np[m]{\n  left:150;\n}\np[l],p[r]{\n  transform:rotate(180deg);\n  bottom:34;\n}\np[l]{\n  left:50;\n}\np[r]{\n  right:50;\n}\n\nMinify the code or CSS by using any CSS Minifier. It helps you to reduce the characters in the code that will increase score.\nIf you like this then don't forget to ❤️ it. And I'll see you in the next article. See you soon.",

The sort of sweet talking, finessing, and gut-decisions that might work in a bull market falls apart very quickly as soon as an investor, customer, or any other stakeholder lowers their risk intolerance.\nIf you’re trying to raise money right now, and you don’t have killer revenue numbers to back up your claims, you’re going to need to make predictions off of all the good data that you work with.\nBut how can you effectively leverage the information you have into coherent predictions?

          "description": "1. What is Dask cuDF?\n\n\nDask cuDF is a library that enables users to work with large dataframes using the dask distributed computing framework. cuDF is a columnar dataframe library that is part of the NVIDIA RAPIDS initiative. Dask cuDF allows users to scale up their data processing workloads by making use of the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs.\nThere are several other libraries that provide similar functionality to dask cuDF. These include Apache Arrow, Pandas, and PySpark. However, dask cuDF has some advantages over these other libraries.\n\nThere are some challenges that come with using dask cuDF. One challenge is that it can be difficult to install and set up dask cuDF on your system. Another challenge is that dask cuDF is still under active development and its API may change in future releases. Finally, dask cuDF is not as welldocumented as some other libraries, making it difficult to learn how to use it effectively.\nThe to_csv() and from_csv() functions are the most basic ways of saving and loading dataframes. They are very simple to use and will work with any type of dataframe. However, they have some limitations. First, they can only save dataframes that fit in memory. Second, they do not support compression. Third, they are not very efficient when saving large dataframes.\nIf you're working with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go. It's much faster than Pandas and easier to use than Spark. So if you're looking for a better way to work with large dataframes, Dask cuDF is the way to go.\nStar our Github repo and join the discussion in our Discord channel to help make BLST even better!\nBLST!",

          "description": "（LCTT 校注：作者原文已经大篇幅进行了修订更新，本文据之前的版本翻译。）\n\r\n今天我在推特上发布了一些关于 OSI 模型如何与 TCP/IP 工作原理的实际表现不相符的观点，这让我思考——OSI 模型到底是什么？通过阅读推特上的一些回复发现，似乎至少存在三种不同的思考方式：\n\r\n\r\nTCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述\n\r\n一个可以用来描述和比较很多不同的网络协议的抽象模型\n\r\n对 1980 年代的一些计算机网络协议的字面描述，这些协议如今大多已不再使用\n\r\n\r\n在这篇文章中，我不打算试图争辩以上哪一个才是“真正”的 OSI 模型——似乎不同的人以所有这些方式思考它。这不重要。\n\r\nOSI 模型有七层\n\r\n在我们讨论 OSI 模型的含义之前，让我们大致地讨论一下它是什么。它是一个抽象模型，用于描述网络如何在七个编号的层上工作：\n\r\n\r\n第一层：物理层\n\r\n第二层：数据链路层\n\r\n第三层：网络层\n\r\n第四层：传输层\n\r\n第五层：会话层\n\r\n第六层：表示层\n\r\n第七层：应用层\n\r\n\r\n我不会再费时地去解释每一层的含义，网上有上千种解释可供查询。\n\r\nOSI 模型：TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述\n\r\n首先，我想谈谈人们在实践中使用 OSI 模型的一种常见方式：作为对 TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述。OSI 模型的某些层非常容易映射到 TCP/IP：\n\r\n\r\n第二层对应以太网\n\r\n第三层对应 IP\n\r\n第四层对应 TCP 或 UDP（或 ICMP 等）\n\r\n第七层对应 TCP 或 UDP 包内的任何内容（例如 DNS 查询）\n\r\n\r\n这种映射对第二、三、四层很有意义——TCP 数据包有三个标头header对应于这三个层（以太网标头、IP 标头和 TCP 标头）。\n\r\n用数字来描述 TCP 数据包中的不同标头非常有用——如果你说“第二层”，很显然它位于第三层“下方”，因为二比三小。\n\r\n“OSI 模型作为字面描述”的古怪之处在于，第五层和第六层并不真正对应于 TCP/IP 中的任何内容——我听说过很多关于第五层或第六层可能是什么的不同解释（你可以说第五层是 TLS 或其他东西！）但它们没有像第二、三、四层那样“每一层在 TCP 数据包中都有相应的标头”这样的明确对应关系。\n\r\n此外，TCP/IP 的某些部分即使在第二层到第四层也不能很好地适应 OSI 模型——例如，哪一层是 ARP 数据包？ARP 数据包发送一些带有以太网标头的数据，这是否意味着它们是第三层？或是第二层？列出不同 OSI 层的维基百科文章将其归类为“第 2.5 层”，这并不令人满意。\n\r\n因为 OSI 模型有时用于教授 TCP/IP，若搞不清楚它的哪些部分可以映射到 TCP/IP，而哪些部分不能，则会令人困惑。这才是真的问题。\n\r\nOSI 模型：用于比较网络协议的一个抽象\n\r\n我听说过的另一种关于 OSI 的思考方式是，它是一种抽象，可以用来在许多不同的网络协议之间进行类比。例如，如果你想了解蓝牙协议的工作原理，也许你可以使用 OSI 模型来帮助你——这是我在 这个网页 上找到的一张图表，显示了蓝牙协议如何适配 OSI 模型。\n\r\n\n\r\n另一个例子是，这篇维基百科文章 有一个 OSI 层列表，详细划分了哪些特定的网络协议对应于这些 OSI 层。\n\r\nOSI 模型：一些过时协议的字面描述\n\r\n维基百科上的一些非常简短的研究表明，除了对这七层的抽象描述之外，OSI 模型还包含了 一组实现这些层的特定协议。显然，这发生在 70 年代和 80 年代的 协议战争 时期，OSI 模型失败了，TCP/IP 则取得了胜利。\n\r\n这就解释了为什么 OSI 模型无法与 TCP/IP 很好地对应，因为如果当时“获胜”的是 OSI 协议，那么 OSI 模型 将 完全对应于互联网网络的实际工作方式。\n\r\n结语\n\r\n我写这篇文章的初衷是，当我最初学习 OSI 模型时，我发现它非常令人困惑（所有这些层是什么？它们是真实存在的吗？这是网络的实际工作原理吗？发生了什么？）我希望有人告诉我这个只使用 TCP/IP 网络协议的人，只需了解 OSI 模型第二、三、四和七层与 TCP/IP 的关系，然后忽略它的所有其他内容即可。所以我希望这篇文章对某些人能有所帮助！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/11/what-s-the-osi-model-/\n\r\n作者：Julia Evans 选题：lujun9972 译者：hanszhao80 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这是如何在 elementary OS 中启用最小化、最大化窗口按钮的方法。\n\r\n\r\n许多人（大多数是 elementary OS 的新用户）在各种论坛上问这些问题：\n\r\n\r\n我怎样才能在 elementary OS 中启用最小化按钮？\n\r\n我如何启用还原、最小化、最大化？\n\r\n有可能恢复最小化和最大化按钮吗？\n\r\n\r\n这些都是完全正常的问题，而且问问题也是可以的。对吧？这篇指南可以帮助他们在 elementary OS 中获得这些按钮。\n\r\nElementary OS 所使用的 Pantheon 桌面并没有默认的标准窗口按钮。其主要原因是通过 Dock 和应用菜单处理用户行为和活动的不同理念。可以说，这种设计或实现的行为模仿了macOS。\n\r\n不过，许多用户更喜欢窗口按钮，因为这是一个所谓的“肌肉记忆”，而且有些人是从其他桌面环境（甚至是 Windows）迁移过来的。\n\r\n尽管 Elementary 没有为你提供这个默认设置，你仍然可以启用它。下面是方法。\n\r\n启用最小化最大化按钮 - elementary OS\n\r\n打开终端，安装添加 PPA 所需的 software-properties-common 软件包。默认情况下，这个包在 elementary OS 中没有安装（不要问我为什么，真的）。\n\r\nsudo apt install software-properties-common\r\n\n\r\nelementary OS 6 Odin\n\r\nelementary Tweak 工具被重新换了个名字，它现在被称为 Pantheon Tweaks，并正在单独开发中。使用以下命令，你可以安装它：\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/pantheon-tweaks\r\nsudo apt install -y pantheon-tweaks\r\n\n\r\nelementary OS 5 Juno 及更低版本\n\r\n如果你使用的是 elementary OS 5 June 及更低版本，你可以使用相同的 PPA 安装早期的 elementary-tweaks。在终端按照以下命令进行操作：\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/elementary-tweaks\r\nsudo apt install -y elementary-tweaks\r\n\n\r\n更改设置\n\r\n\r\n\r\n安装后，点击顶部栏的“应用Application”，打开“系统设置System settings”。在系统设置窗口中，点击“个人Personal”下的 “Tweaks”。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n在 Tweaks 窗口中，进入“外观Appearance”。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n在窗口控制下，选择布局：“Windows”。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n然后在顶部窗口栏的右侧应该有最小化、最大化和关闭按钮了。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n也有其他组合形式，如 Ubuntu、macOS 等。你可以选择任何你觉得合适的：\n\r\n\n\r\n这篇指南至此就结束了。系统设置中还有其他选项，你可以尝试使用，但窗口管理器 gala 最近删除了这些选项。因此，它们目前可能无法工作。\n\r\n我希望这个指南能帮助你启用 elementary OS 的最小化最大化按钮。如果你需要任何帮助，请在下面的评论栏告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2021/08/enable-minimize-maximize-elementary/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "早在 2009 年，Minecraft 就来到了这个世界。从那时起，它已经成为一种文化现象。在这段时间里，一些开发者发布了具有类似想法和机制的开源游戏。今天，我们将看看其中最大的一个：Minetest。\n\r\n什么是 Minetest？\n\r\n\n\r\nMinetest，简单地说，是一个基于体素voxel的沙盒游戏，与 Minecraft 非常相似。与 Minecraft 不同的是，Minetest 是用 C++ 编写的，并被设计成可以在大多数系统上原生运行。它也有一个非常大的地图区域。地图大小为 “62,000 × 62,000 × 62,000 块”，“你可以向下开采 31,000 块，或向上建造 31,000 块”。\n\r\n有趣的是，Minetest 最初是以专有许可证发布的，但后来被重新授权为 GPL。此后，它又被重新授权为 LGPL。\n\r\nMinetest 有几种模式。你可以建造并发挥创意，或者你可以尝试在各种元素中生存。你并不局限于这些模式。Minetest 有大量的 额外内容，包括 模组mod、纹理包和在 Minetest 中建立的游戏。这主要是通过 Minetest 的 模组 API 和 Lua 完成的。\n\r\n\n\r\n对于那些玩过 Minecraft 的人来说，你会发现 Minetest 中的体验非常相似。你可以挖掘资源，建造结构，并结合材料来制作工具。我在 Minetest 中没有注意到的一件事是怪物。我认为 Minetest 中没有任何生物，但话说回来，我只在创意模式中玩过。我还没有玩过生存模式。\n\r\nMinetest 也被用于 教育。例如，瑞士 CERN 的人用 Minetest 创造了一个游戏，以 展示互联网是如何工作的 以及它是如何被创造出来的。Minetest 还被用于 教授 编程、地球科学以及微积分和三角学。\n\r\n\n\r\n如何安装 Minetest?\n\r\nMinetest 几乎在每个系统上都可以使用。下面是一个命令列表，你可以用它来在一些最流行的 Linux 发行版中安装 Minetest。\n\r\nUbuntu 或者 Debian\n\r\n如果你有一个基于 Ubuntu 或 Debian 的发行版，只要在终端输入这个命令：\n\r\nsudo apt install mintest\r\n\n\r\nArch 或者 Manjaro\n\r\n对于基于 Arch 的系统（如 Manjaro），使用：\n\r\nsudo pacman -S minetest\r\n\n\r\nFedora\n\r\n你可以从 Fedora 服务器中输入以下命令安装 Mintest：\n\r\nsudo dnf install mintest\r\n\n\r\nopenSUSE\n\r\nopenSUSE 用户可以用这个命令安装 Minetest：\n\r\nsudo zypper in mintest\r\n\n\r\nFreeBSD\n\r\nFreeBSD 用户很幸运。他们可以用这个命令安装 Mintest：\n\r\npkg install minetest minetest_game\r\n\n\r\nSnap\n\r\n要安装 Minetest 的 Snap 包，请在终端输入以下命令：\n\r\nsudo snap install minetest\r\n\n\r\nFlathub\n\r\n要安装，请输入：\n\r\nflatpak install flathub net.minetest.Minetest\r\n\n\r\n你可以在 这里 下载 Windows 的可移植执行文件。你也可以在 Android 上安装 Minetest，可以通过 Google Play 或 下载 APK。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n\n\r\n我已经在 Minetest 中花了几个小时在我的本地系统上进行构建和探索。它非常有趣。我还没来得及尝试任何额外的内容，因为我对我玩过的相对较少的游戏部分非常满意。我遇到的唯一麻烦是，由于某种原因，它在 Fedora 上运行缓慢。我可能存在一些配置上的错误。\n\r\n如果你曾经认为 Minecraft 看起来很有趣，但不想花钱，那就去看看 Minetest。你会很高兴你这么做。\n\r\n如果你玩过 Minetest，在评论中告诉我们你的体验如何。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/minetest/\n\r\n作者：John Paul 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

(Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\r\n这是一项后天习得的技能，最初几次需要一些努力。学习如何将大任务分解成更小的步骤可以让您跟踪实现目标或完成大任务的进度，而不会在过程中不知所措。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/1/break-down-tasks\n\r\n作者：Kevin Sonney 选题：lujun9972 译者：Donkey 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "键盘快捷键让我专注于我要传递的内容，而不是它的外观。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n从我记事起，我就一直在使用文字处理软件。当文字处理器从直接格式化转向利用样式来改变文本在页面上的显示方式时，这对我的写作有很大的推动作用。\n\r\nLibreOffice 提供了多种样式，你可以使用它们来创建各种内容。 LibreOffice 将段落样式应用于文本块，例如正文、列表和代码示例。字符样式类似，只是这些样式适用于段落内的内联词或其他短文本。使用“视图View -> 样式Styles”菜单，或使用 F11 键盘快捷键，调出样式选择器。\n\r\n\n\r\n使用样式可以更轻松地编写更长的文档。看看这个例子：作为咨询实践的一部分，我写了很多工作簿和培训材料。一个工作簿可能有 40 或 60 页长，具体取决于主题，并且可以包含各种内容，例如正文、表格和列表。我的一些技术培训材料可能还包括源代码示例。\n\r\n我有一个提供给客户的标准培训集，但我也做定制的培训计划。在处理自定义程序时，我可能会先从另一个工作簿导入文本，然后从那里开始工作。根据客户的不同，我可能还会调整字体和其他样式元素以匹配客户的样式偏好。对于其他材料，我可能需要添加源代码示例。\n\r\n要使用直接格式输入示例源代码，我需要设置字体并调整工作簿中每个代码块的边距。如果我后来决定我的工作簿应该对正文文本或源代码示例使用不同的字体，我需要返回并更改所有内容。对于包含多个代码示例的工作簿，这可能需要几个小时来查找每个源代码示例并调整字体和边距以匹配新的首选格式。\n\r\n但是，通过使用样式，我可以更新定义一次，为正文样式使用不同的字体，并且 LibreOffice Writer 会在所有使用正文样式的地方更新我的文档。同样，我可以调整预格式化文本样式的字体和边距，LibreOffice Writer 会将这种新样式应用到每个具有预格式化文本样式的源代码示例中。这对于其他文本块也是如此，包括标题、源代码、列表以及页眉和页脚。\n\r\n我最近有了一个好主意，更新 LibreOffice 键盘快捷键以简化我的写作过程。我重新定义了 Ctrl + B 设置加粗强调字符样式，Ctrl + I 设置强调字符样式，Ctrl + 空格 设置取消字符样式。这使我的写作变得更加容易，因为我不必暂停写作，这样我就可以高亮显示一些文本并选择一种新的风格。相反，我可以使用新的 Ctrl + I 键盘快捷键来设置字符样式，它本质上是斜体文本。之后我输入的任何内容都使用强调样式，直到我按 Ctrl + 空格 将字符样式重置为默认的无字符样式。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你想自己设置的，请使用“工具Tools -> 自定义Customize”， 然后单击“键盘Keyboard”选项卡以修改键盘快捷键。\n\r\n\n\r\nLibreOffice 通过样式使技术写作变得更加容易。通过利用键盘快捷键，我简化了我的写作方式，让我专注于我要交付的内容，而不是它的外观。稍后我可能会更改格式，但样式保持不变。\n\r\n图片来源：（Jim Hall，CC BY-SA 40）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/6/libreoffice-keyboard-shortcuts\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "GitHub Copilot 来了，它能帮助程序员，为他们提供人工智能的编码建议，不过，它是否会让事情变得更糟呢？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n在 2021 年，我曾花了好几个小时来翻阅 GitHub Copilot 文档，试图弄清楚如何能够加入它的技术预览计划。还好，这一切都得到了回报，我成功加入了预览计划。\n\r\n而现在，它终于可供所有人使用啦！\n\r\n如果你还不知道的话，GitHub Copilot 是一个 AI 助手，可帮助你更快、更高效地编写代码。\n\r\n我能想到的最类似的东西，就是你手机上的（输入法的）自动完成功能。不过，与自动完成功能不同，GitHub Copilot 编写代码，就相当于是在完成整段的句子。\n\r\nCopilot 现已可供大众使用\n\r\n正如我在前面提到的，Copilot 已经处于技术预览阶段将近一年了。这意味着，GitHub 只允许非常有限数量的开发者免费使用它，以换取同意 GitHub 监控他们的使用情况，从而改进程序的最终版本。\n\r\n看起来 GitHub 终于满意地向公众发布了它。现在，任何拥有 GitHub 帐户的人都应该能够使用它，尽管需要付出一定的代价（我很快就会在下面提到）。\n\r\n公告 中提到：\n\r\n\r\n直到不久前，人工智能都没有能够帮助改进代码，开发软件的过程几乎完全是手动的。现在，这种情况正在改变。今天，我很高兴地宣布，我们正在向所有个人开发者提供 GitHub Copilot。你的 AI 配对程序员来啦。\n\r\n—— Thomas Dohmke，GitHub CEO\n\r\n\r\nCopilot 作为免费的编辑器扩展，已经帮助数百万开发者加快了他们的编程速度。然而，它确实是有代价的，无论是直接的还是间接的。\n\r\nGitHub Copilot 定价\n\r\n与几乎所有令人兴奋的新技术一样，Copilot 对某些人来说可能过于昂贵。它将花费你 10 美元/月或 100 美元/年。\n\r\n如果你是开源项目维护者或经过验证的学生，那么你可以免费使用它。\n\r\nGitHub Copilot 不道德吗？\n\r\n围绕 GitHub Copilot 产品的争议巨大且令人担忧。从技术上讲，这个人工智能是使用大家托管在 GitHub 上的代码来进行训练的。\n\r\n因此，基本上，GitHub 是通过使用你的代码来提供一个新产品（如果你愿意的话，还可以加点料）。而且，关于 Copilot，可别忘了，自由软件基金会（FSF）也 建议 不要在 GitHub 上托管代码。\n\r\n我们知道，企业总是喜欢利用事物，但有些人认为这应该不会直接损害托管在 GitHub 上的项目/代码。\n\r\n但是，是这样吗？\n\r\n简而言之，在 Copilot 发布后，许多开发者都分享说，他们发现 GitHub Copilot 生成了受版权保护的代码：\n\r\n\r\n我试了下 GitHub Copilot，这是一项付费服务​​，来看看它是否会使用带有限制性许可证的存储库的代码。我检查了它，看看它是否有我在之前雇主那里编写的代码，该代码有一个许可证，只允许其用于免费游戏，并且需要附加许可证。是的，它确实有。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当然，如果我们查看 GitHub Copilot 的常见问题解答（FAQ），其中提到：\n\r\n\r\nGitHub 不拥有 GitHub Copilot 生成的建议。您在 GitHub Copilot 的帮助下编写的代码属于您自己，由您自己负责。\n\r\n\r\n所以说，你为一项服务付了费，最终却为你的项目增加了不便和更多的工作？\n\r\n在我看来，就简化开发者的任务而言，这听起来一点儿也不令人兴奋。\n\r\n你对此有什么想法？请在下面的评论区中分享一下吧！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/github-copilot/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "喜欢就是生产力，这是昨天飞书玩家大会的 Slogan，我也在视频里分享了一段少数派的小故事，有兴趣的朋友可以去看看回放。我个人很喜欢这句话，顺便分享一点想法。\n我个人的成长经历就印证了这句话，无论是学历（大专）、专业（中医）、背景（贸易），都跟我过去十年做的事情无关（科技、内容、互联网），能走到如今这一步，全是因为喜欢。\n这个喜欢可以分为两部分，一个是喜欢基于文字的表达，也就是写作。不管是小学写作文，还是中学写情书，到工作后写总结报告，我都能从写作中找到愉悦和成就。而这个能力，帮我跨越了专业和背景，获得老师的关注，俘获芳心，在职场中快速晋升，包括说服投资人支持我创业，你说这算不算生产力。\n另一部分，是对电子科技的喜欢，当然这可能是大部分男孩的天性。中学的时候，家里搞电器维修，留下一堆破烂零件，我就利用他们打造自己的「人工」智能家居系统，有各种发光二极管+闪光器构建的氛围灯，还有隐藏各处的喇叭，打造虚拟立体声音响。那时候就畅想过智能家居、无线互联等各种的梦幻场景，今天全都实现了，我也没有被淘汰，乐在其中。\n这两个喜欢结合在一块，有了我的第一个烧麦博客，第一个煮机社区，以及今天的少数派。我们一直在发现和聚拢那些真正喜欢的人，一起创造价值，而不是过于关注他们的专业和背景。\n这个理念也融合到团队的组建和管理当中，每一个成员加入公司的时候，我都会更关注他对少数派的认知，对自己领域的喜爱程度。如果没有这个基础，我们可能会付出大量的管理和沟通成本，还会带来更多的误会和不悦。\n渐渐的，从广大的作者中筛选团队成员就成了最佳模式，这其中不乏清北名校、一线大厂的优秀人才，他们放弃更加稳定和优渥的条件，选择从事自己喜欢的事情，创造更多可见的价值。没有了传统公司的条条框框，更好的释放自身潜能。尽管聚散无常，不管未来走向何处，他们带着的是自己的实战能力，而不是所谓的辉煌履历。\n朋友在一家上市公司当主管，有完备的薪资和股权奖励体系，他却经常跟我抱怨年轻人想法多，离职率很高，而每一个新员工，都要花大量的时间重新建立信任，接手工作。然后又不知道哪一天突然提出离职。\n\n而另一方面，我们同一楼层的游戏公司老板，正在参考少数派办公室的风格，筹划着给团队成员配上升降桌，工学椅，更换有设计感的桌面设备，这些被忽略的细枝末节，却能构建创意氛围，激发团队成员的创造力。\n如今，创业浪潮已过，泡沫退去，一地狼藉。而最终留下来的创业公司，都应该思考自己的企业文化和管理模式，所谓的强势管理驱动，已经不适合这一代年轻人，更不适合创意型企业。用喜欢驱动，才是可持续的生产力。",

          "description": "温馨提示：改装有风险，刷机需谨慎。\n\n我买了台二手的 iPod Video\n最近买了一台来自 2005 年的 iPod Classic 第五代，它是首款能播放 h264 也就是 mp4 视频的 iPod，所以也被称为 iPod Video。我的这台是 190 元在闲鱼「捡到的」，30G 机械硬盘的版本，对是机械硬盘。你在切歌和开机的时候都能听到硬盘「cici」的声音，有一点点烦人，好处是你要是愿意还能买到 60G 甚至 80G 的版本（会更厚），在那个年代算得上是海量的存储了。\n\n这台 iPod Video 已经走过了 17 个年头，应该也跟随陪伴过 n 位主人，在外观上留下了不少他们拥有过的痕迹，收到的时候里面还有几首已经不再流行的歌曲。电池当然不太经用了，但正常听歌使用完全没问题。\n\n如果你是 Apple TV 用户，你会发现 iPod 和 TV 的遥控器设计的特别像，相同的配色、相同的按键逻辑，让人感叹十几年过去了苹果的设计语言似乎没有发生过改变，我更希望的是在 2022 年它还能继续陪伴我更久一点。\n改装 1TB 透明版\n\n萌生改装的想法是在时间线上看到 ellie 的分享，透明的外壳配合 iPod Video 的主板真的好看呐。有了想法之后就搜寻各种合适的配件和教程发现：iPod Video 的所有模块基本都能买到，并且拆卸安装也只需要翘板和螺丝刀整个过程也比较简单。\n\n需要的材料\n\niPod Video 30G 版本（Video 的外壳是塑料的更换简单可选择的多，30G 版本便宜一点，30G 后壳的选择也多很多，因为前盖和后盖都是更换的，成色不用太在意，屏幕上有一层外壳保证屏幕正常显示就 OK）\n你喜欢颜色的前盖和后盖（可以按照你的风格进行搭配，如果需要转盘和中间的按钮也是可以买到的）\n双 TF 卡拓展板 + 大电池（因为之前里面是机械硬盘，换到 TF 卡后就有足够的空间让给电池，这家买是有送翘板等工具的，小的螺丝刀得自己准备）\nTF 卡（个人推荐买一张 128G 的就完全足够使用了）\n\n以上可以自行购买，我的都是看着顺眼买的，没有过多讲究更没有利益关系。\n\n拆解推荐看看 iFixit 的教程，每个模块都有专业图文并貌的描述 ，以及店家提供的方法。除了第一次拆后壳稍微费点劲，其它都非常简单。如果你买的是透明壳的话，为了好看推荐你准备 WD-40 或者除胶剂对屏幕上的贴纸残胶进行下处理。在装回去之前，插上数据线连接电脑看能不能正常识别 iPod 和硬盘大小，这样可以避免你重新拆开安装的麻烦。\n\n组装好后数据线连接电脑，打开 iTunes（如果使用的是 Mac 则是访达）选择恢复 iPod 即可，这个过程可能会比较慢耐心等待即可。\n安装 Rockbox + FreshOS\n\niPod Video 的系统早已经没有了更新，iTunes 在 Mac 上也不复存在，但我还是得说一句 iTunes 是真的难用。Rockbox 则是一个开源免费的音乐播放器系统，适配了众多款的 iPod 以及其它品牌的音乐播放器。我选择使用 Rockbox 看中了持续更新的系统、对音乐格式有更好的支持、众多个性化的主题、更加丰富的功能、倒入音乐也不需要 iTunes，直接拖入就行、另外原有的系统也不受影响。\n\nRockbox 的安装极其简单方便，下载好官方安装程序，连接上 iPod，选择 Install 即可直接完成安装。\n\nFreshOS 是基于 Rockbox 的一款第三方主题，有 Light 和 Dark 两个版本。安装同样非常简单，下载 FreshOS 后将 .rockbox 文件夹内所有文件拖进 iPod 的 .rockbox 文件夹内直接覆盖即可完成安装。\n改装好的 iPod\n透明+黑色转盘蓝色的后盖搭配 se215 耳机Rockbox 遥控器\n除了漂亮以外，最大的感觉是轻了很多很多，因为之前的机械硬盘在体积和重量上占的比例都很大。我自己改装成了 512G + 512G 也就是 1TB 的版本 ，其实真的用不到那么大的空间，主要接口导入速度的限制，太大的空间也不实用。续航真是好了太多，除了电池换了新的以外，电池容量也直接大了好几倍，加上 TF 卡也更省电了。还有一个我非常喜欢的功能：上文提到过 Apple TV 的遥控器和 iPod 很像，在 Rockbox 系统下 iPod 连接电脑能直接作为电脑的遥控器，切换歌曲控制音量，一气呵成。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰 \n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "前言\n\n作为特斯拉Model Y车主，有多次和大家分享过个人用车体验、配件选择和保养分享。对于特斯拉全系车辆，每款车都有的就是内置空调滤芯。特斯拉官方的产品都是曼牌提供的，model 3和model y的原厂空调滤芯就是曼牌的FP25015，属于曼牌中带抗菌功能的高端产品。曼牌好价加工时费可以200以内搞定一对，特斯拉官方加了工时不打折是400不到，基本翻了个倍。\n\n就是图里这款，京东链接附上，京东车品打折时价格不高，推荐车主朋友每逢大促购置以备更换，其它的马勒、博世、科德宝等大的品牌也都有对应的产品，同样可以考虑。\n\n但对于Model Y而言，多了一套HEPA高效空气过滤系统。虽然这个名词看起来很高级，本质上就是在驾舱外的空调进气口多了外置的空调滤芯。比起Model 3，这套外置的滤芯让全车实现了两重的空调过滤，整体的过滤效果更好，也让空调支持了一个生化模式。\n\n在空调界面，通过这个病毒一样的图标就可以开启这个模式（图为老系统，新系统的按键位置有所改变）。在生化模式下，空调会高档位进气，让驾舱内形成正压状态，外界空气无法从缝隙进入驾舱，官方说在雾霾天能保证更好的空气质量，但我在上海用车一年也遇不到太多天的大雾霾，但我觉得车内空气不理想时，会开启这一模式，实际效果不错。\n正因为这一模式下空调会高流量运行，就对滤芯有更高的要求，所以也只有配置了外置滤芯的Model Y才有这个功能。\n去年3月提车，4月上牌开始用车，加上今年上海居家两个月，我的车实际使用就是1年加2万公里，去年更换过一次内置的空调滤芯。\n\n这是我去年1万公里时换下来的内置小滤芯，就是曼牌的FP25015，1万公里更换有些浪费了，小滤芯的状态还是比较不错的。\n今年马上入夏，属于空调高频使用周期，所以计划更换外置的HEPA大滤芯，最初我也打算电商购买，结果因为没弄明白产品，也以为官方不贵，去官方售后预约了服务，最后…",

          "description": "一、背景介绍\n相信有不少朋友遇到过这样的烦恼，Windows 笔记本有几个按键坏了，笔记本又刚好过了保修期。拿到售后一问，好家伙，修笔记本的薄膜键盘要一百多的维修费。而一百多已经可以买一把机械键盘了，隐隐约约觉得这笔维修费很不值，但是那失灵的几个按键又很膈应。\n本篇文章就尝试为这样的烦恼提供解决思路，除了可以使用 PowerToys 解决外，还会列出一些备选方案。\n\n二、解决思路\n（一）使用 PowerToys 解决\n1.PowerToys 介绍\n\n又有谁能比 Microsoft 更懂 Windows 呢？\n——《少数派 2021 年度应用出炉，这些 App 是我们的「年度之选」》\n\nPowerToys 可以算是 Windows 官方出品的”外挂“或者”瑞士军刀“，其中有很多可以帮助用户提高 Windows 使用效率的功能，本篇文章就是使用键盘管理器功能。\nPowerToys 的键盘管理器功能\n2.使用指南\n读者可以看看键盘上的 F 键，能回想起来上一次使用这些 F 键是什么时候吗？没错，可以尝试把失灵的按键重映射到不常用的 F 键上解决问题。\n重映射键\n比如说笔记本键盘字母区域上面的数字键”9“坏了，而”F9“键又刚刚好在”9“键的上面，所以我把物理键”9“映射到”F9“。\n重映射键”F9“至”9“\n现在，理论上问题已经解决了，当我按下”F9“就能完成如下的输入：\nF9 = 9\nShift + F9 = Shift + 9 = （\n没错，重映射键之后相应的组合键也是生效的！\n3.提醒\n有读者可能感到疑惑，我的”9“键都坏了，那在重映射键界面怎么输入”9“呢？\n好问题，其实在首次设置的时候还是要外接一块正常的键盘的，不过这应该是可以办得到的吧。首次设置好之后，只需保持 PowerToys 的启动时运行为开启状态，那么理论上设置的重映射将一直生效。\n其次，虽然说 F 键有 12 个，理论上笔记本键盘允许坏掉的按键也有 12 个，但是我觉得坏键个数的容忍范围大约在九个左右，因为还是有几个 F 键挺常用的。比如：\nF2：文件重命名\nF5：刷新或者编程工具的快捷键\nF12：网页的检查\n这几个比较常用的 F 键不建议设置重映射。当然，其实能通过键盘管理器的重新映射快捷键解决，甚至使用重新映射快捷键还能映射远多于 12 个的失灵按键，但是到了这个阶段，还是建议直接更换键盘了。\n重映射快捷键\n（二）使用屏幕键盘解决（备选方案）\n屏幕键盘\n（三）使用 AutoHotkey 或者 AutoIt（备选方案）\n其实这类热键脚本语言程序不是那么推荐，因为要进行一定的编程。既然都通过热键解决了，为什么不用 PowerToys 的重映射键呢？\n（四）自己更换笔记本键盘（备选方案）\n其实键盘维修的物料费往往在一百元以下，剩下的都是人工费。想节省人工费自己更换键盘，其实并没有想象中那么难，先仔细检索查阅教程，跟着教程一步一步操作通常还是能成功的。\n比如我就在发现已经有 12 个按键坏掉之后，自己动手更换了笔记本的键盘，甚至还记录下了一篇教程《小米 Air 13.3 拆机换键盘步骤》。\n\n三、结语\nPowerToys 的键盘管理器能做到的不只是重映射失灵的按键，少数派文章《6 个实用技巧和软件，让你的 Windows 11 更加称心如意》就介绍了如何借助 PowerToys 的快捷键重映射处理烦人的 Teams 和小组件，而且少数派中有不少文章介绍 PowerToys 的其他强大功能。\n读者可以在 GitHub 免费下载到 PowerToys。\n（一）关联阅读\n\n微软出品的窗口管理工具，还能让你不再苦记快捷键：PowerToys\nWindows 10 官方「外挂」更新，这 3 个实用小功能你或许用得上\nWindows 10 也有「官方」取色工具了：PowerToys 0.20 更新详解",

          "description": "罗哥就这样退网了，本来想写点什么，写到一半又放下，看完了晚点 LatePost 的采访全文，又无意中刷到了那场八年前的直播辩论，还是忍不住写下这篇。\n在罗哥做手机之前，我是完全不认识他的，毕竟我触网时间比较晚，似乎错过了很多热闹的早期网事。直到有一天，罗哥开始在微博上吐槽各家手机操作系统，包括已经被抛弃的 webOS，作为这个系统的社区站长，我责任感爆棚，用煮机网的官方账号，开始跟罗哥在微博上争论，不打不相识，由此产生了随后的各种故事。 \n那时候煮机网的粉丝才四五万，罗哥的粉丝应该是八百万，结结实实的被网虐了一番。于是我自己下了一个赌注，如果罗哥的手机做出来，有六成专业用户都认可，我就全站挂横幅，并登门道歉。但罗哥应该根本不记得这个事，在众多的微博对战中，我应该是最小，最没有背景的那一个。\n后来，Smartisan OS 发布了，很酷很漂亮，再后来，锤子 T1 上市了，我第一时间买了一台，用了一段时间之后，我觉得我应该道歉，它虽然有很多不完善，但已经是一个很强的手机了，尤其是罗哥这个外行人做出来的。\n就这样，通过微博私聊预约，我在摩托罗拉大厦的锤子科技的会议室见到了罗哥，那天的我超级紧张，因为我是没想到能见到他的，毕竟既是超级网红又是企业老板。\n迟了几分钟，罗哥出现了，对我说的第一句不算客气：麦老板，你有何指教？\n其实可以理解，罗哥脾气直率，很多媒体人见了罗哥，表面说一套，回去又写成另一套，这种事情多了之后，对媒体人的态度自然好不了。但当我表示是专程来道歉，同时希望获得一些创业指导时，罗哥的话匣子就敞开了。\n首先，罗哥不看好媒体创业，尤其是评测媒体，没有良性的商业路径，除非你足够流氓。他还用自己牛博网的经历来告诉我，做内容有多难。罗哥建议我多看看数码产品和配件，深圳有最好的供应链，做点好产品更有价值。\n这次聊天之后，我决定逐渐停掉以「评测和评论」为主的煮机网，集中精力投入到专注软件和教程的少数派，先服务好用户，再拓展 B 端业务。所以我们后来选择了内容付费，数码和配件联名定制，也成了我们今天的收入主力。\n两年之后，我们推出了官方的付费栏目 Power+，拿到外部平台宣传时，需要有名人推荐，我在微信里找了一圈，发现自己实在不认识名人，就冒昧的请求罗哥写一段推荐语。许久之后得到了罗哥的回复，他竟然答应了，并表示他也是少数派的读者，这顿时让我信心倍增。\n又过了一年，罗哥来深圳了，约我喝杯咖啡，那时正是坚果销量过百万的时候，感觉锤子科技终于熬过了最难的阶段，要开始快速发展了。\n罗哥憧憬着未来，顺便问了我的情况：你现在做的怎么样？我说就是做一些软件和系统教程，帮助用户更好的玩转手机。罗哥突然想到，我们手机系统里有很多功能彩蛋，产品经理没空写，营销部门写不好，不如交给你来做吧。\n就这样，我们开始给 Smartisan OS 挖掘使用方法和场景内容，就有了一篇“如何用坚果手机帮我做香港代购”的精彩文章，让大家看到手机系统的生产力价值。当然，也会有一帮人怀疑我们内容造假，但不管怎样，这个专题成了少数派内容服务的经典案例。\n然而事情并没有往想象中发展，鸟巢的发布会我也去了现场，我希望能有重大转折，但感觉 TNT 的摊子铺的太大了，坐在角落为罗哥捏把汗。随后的日子里，不好的消息一个接着一个，可以想象罗哥的焦头烂额，我也再没有去打扰他。\n尽管不希望罗哥失败，Smartisan OS 终究还是被收购了，罗哥为了给锤子科技还债，转身进入了直播带货界。这时，我们的数码配件也终于做出来了，并且进了罗哥的直播间。据了解，正值 iPhone 12 发布，官方充电器减配，当晚的竞标是比较激烈的，但是罗哥还是选择了我们这个新晋小品牌，介绍产品的时候，罗哥也多点评了一句：在我们做手机的那么多年里，少数派是罕见能保持公正评价的科技媒体。我看了之后感慨万千，好在我们的产品设计还算争气，作为最早的彩色充电器，冲进了热销榜第三名。\n如今，罗哥彻底离开了社交网络，很难再看到他的观点和态度，而他在 AR 领域的新产品，可能也要几年之后才能跟大家见面，我突然感觉一个时代结束了，有种莫名的失落感。作为草根出身的东北人，罗哥有没有改变手机和直播行业，我无权评价；但作为理想主义创业者，罗哥实实在在的影响了我和我的事业。\n\n2014 年 8 月 25 日的第一次见面，转眼就过去八年了，我们经历了很多困难，却都没有放弃创业。如今，罗哥五十，我也四十了，依然期待那一天，我们还能江湖再见！",

          "description": "嘿 Siri，核酸检测。\n\n背景\n作者的所在地是郑州，目前我们实行的是每两天（48小时）一次核酸检测。\n所有公共场所或是小区等地均有专属场所码，在进入该场所之前需要使用微信或支付宝扫码，并把扫码结果出示给工作人员，扫码后你的手机上会显示如下信息：\n\n当前场所名称\n动态显示当前日期与时间\n你的姓名与身份证（部分遮挡）\n48 小时内的核酸检测结果\n疫苗接种情况\n如果是绿码，则整体的背景色为绿色\n我是腺体疫苗，只有两针剂\n其中多数公共场所必须 48 小时内的核酸检测结果为阴性才能进入，而除了成年人要每两日检测核酸之外，没有手机身份证的儿童也会在幼儿园、学校等要求下，不定期上传核酸检测结果。\n所以检测核酸几乎成了郑州人民的日常。\n静态核酸检测码\n其他地区不太清楚，但是我们这边全市公共核酸检测，使用的都是同一套系统，且每个人的检测二维码自申请之日起就是固定不变的，这也使得检测码可以被离线调取。\n如何判断你的检测码是否是静态的，可以使用这个方法：\n\n将不同时间获取的检测二维码分别截图储存；\n用微信扫描这些二维码，看里边的文本内容是不是一致的；\n如果内容每次一样，就说明为静态二维码。\n\n为了实现全民出行随时能有 48 小时的阴性核酸，全市像这样的检测屋大概有 4000 多个，分布在大街小巷。在需要做核酸检测的时候，在检测屋窗户右下角的位置让扫码设备扫一下你的核酸检测码，就可以识别出你的信息，然后进行下一步的检测。\n\n为什么要用快捷指令\n正常情况下我们调取核酸检测码，是在一个叫做「郑好办」的 APP 中，大概需要经过 4 次点击才能找到，如果网络状况差，可能等待的时间会更久。所以大多数人都把检测码截图放在相册中，使用的时候打开相册找出来就可以。\n但这种方式始终不够酷。\n使用快捷指令，除了可以迅速出示检测码之外，还可以通过 Siri 调取。而且这些动作也都同时可以在你的 Apple watch 上体验：\n\n举起手臂唤起 Siri ；\n说出「核酸检测」；\n将手表对准扫码设备。\n\n一气呵成。\n\n具体操作步骤\n想要实现单个人的二维码调取非常简单，大体思路就是，把图片转为 Base64 编码1的文本，存入快捷指令（因为快捷指令只能离线存储文本，不能存储多媒体信息），然后在快捷指令中解码呈现。具体的操作步骤如下：\n1.  准备好你的核酸检测二维码截图；\n2. 把截图裁剪为正方形，只保留二维码的部分2；\n3. 通过这个网址将二维码图片转为 Base64 编码的文本；\n4. 转换后的文本要将开头声明数据类型的这部分删除（重要）：data:image/jpeg;base64, 然后复制剩余文本；\n图片分辨率越低，转换后的代码越短，越不容易卡顿\n5. 打开快捷指令，新建一个快捷指令「核酸检测」3；\n6. 拖出一个「文本」组件，并填入第 4 步中转换好并处理完毕的 Base64 编码文本；\n7. 紧接着拖出一个「Base64 编码」组件，并设置为「解码」；\n8. 最后加入一个「快速查看」，设置显示「Base64 已编码内容」，同时将类型设置为「图像」。\n使用「快速查看」而不使用「显示结果」是为了通过Siri语音操作时也可以正常显示\n稍微进阶一下\n如果你像我一样，要时常带着儿子或者女儿去做核酸检测，那么你手机中一定存有他们的检测码。这时候我们把上边的快捷指令稍微改动一下，增加一个二级菜单，就可以实现在一个快捷指令中，调取不同人的检测二维码了。具体改动操作如下：\n1. 在原快捷指令的最上方加入「从菜单中选取」；\n2. 分别命名你要调取的二维码名称（比如：爸爸、儿子、张三等，这个步骤关系到你使用 Siri 操作时的指令语言）；\n3. 在每个菜单分类的下方，加入一个「文本」组件，并通过上方 2、3、4 步骤中处理二维码与 Base64 代码的方法，把处理好的代码分别贴进对应的「文本」组件中。\n\n带有二级菜单的快捷指令，在使用 Siri 调取的时候，需要二次对话，讲出二级菜单的名称。但是真实的场景是，如果不是为了装 X ，更多时候我还是会选择在快捷指令下用手点击调取。\n\n最后\n虽然本文是利用快捷指令来展示核酸检测码，但是同样的方法也可以用于出示其它信息。比如微信名片、推广二维码、或是一些其它你想展示的任何内容。只要你想展示的信息或者二维码是静态固定不变的，就都可以利用该快捷指令实现。你也可以把你经常会用到的静态二维码，利用上方进阶版的方法，全部做到一个快捷指令中，通过二级菜单进行调取。\n每个人对于快捷指令的认识程度各不相同，文章也希望能够让一些零基础的同学自主操作，所以很多地方写的较为详细，目的在于能帮到更多有此类需要的人群。\n感谢阅读，希望文章能对你有帮助。",

          "description": "在上一篇文章中提到目前我国的法规中没有要求有牵引资质的车辆才能拉拖挂房车，因此理论上任何家用车都可以拉拖挂（五菱宏光MINI这类微型乘用车除外）。\n不过我想补充一下，这仅仅只是法规上没有要求而已，我认为这是由于我国拖挂房车市场还没有成熟导致的相关法规缺失，以后大概率会补充相关的法律条款；在这之前我不建议小轿车、低排量SUV用户拉拖挂，除非你确实懂得怎么合理牵引拖挂、明白相关的原理、知道怎么正确安装牵引装置。\n因为这两类车动力太小不适合拉拖挂，而且99%没有针对拖挂房车这个场景做优化，也不会原厂带有牵引结构，如果你不懂相关的知识，很容易给你的前车造成损坏，不仅会危及道路、人身安全，也会影响你车子的价值。欧美地区确实有很多POLO、高尔夫、SMART拉拖挂的，那是建立在它们房车市场成熟基础上的。\n补充完毕，这一篇文章我们来聊一聊拖挂房车上牌和保险的相关事宜。\n拖挂房车要不要上牌？\n根据《道路交通安全法实施条例》第56条，“小型载客汽车只允许牵引旅居挂车或者总质量700千克以下的挂车。”有的小伙伴可能会对这条产生误解，以为只能拉700公斤以下的房车，其实这里提到了两个不同的概念：旅居挂车和700公斤以下的挂车，他们同属于挂车。\n\n \n​而旅居挂车就是我们说的拖挂房车，而根据C6驾照的准驾要求，可以驾驶的是轻型牵引挂车且两车相加小于4500KG，轻型的定义是750KG-4500KG。至于700KG以下的挂车则属于微型挂车了。\n\n​\n​\n那挂车属于机动车吗？根据2020年实施的公安部公共安全行业标准，挂车也属于机动车，因此拖挂房车也是需要上牌的，而且上牌流程和家用车基本一致，需要注意的就是拖挂房车上牌不需要拖挂的交强险，这点在下面细说；然后有的小检测站可能没有检测过拖挂房车所以会不给你检、有的车管所会要求先交购置税再检测等。\n\n​\n拖挂房车交保险要注意什么？\n​首先要明确的是，根据《道路交通安全法》，拖挂房车是不需要投保交强险的，交强险和牵引的前车共享，如果交强险的额度不够赔偿，再由拖挂的商业险进行承担。\n\n​\n所以我们只要购买拖挂房车的商业险就好了。不过由于拖挂还不流行，所以很多小城市的保险公司业务员根本不知道怎么给拖挂房车上保险，他们很可能会给你上特种车辆的保险，这种保险是很贵的，一定要沟通好。一辆十几万的拖挂房车，三者险加车损险一般1500元以内就可以搞定。\n在给拖挂房车上牌时也不需要提供拖挂的交强险，但要提交前车的交强险，这里要注意的是，拖挂房车可以由任意车辆牵引，上牌时上交当时牵引车的交强险即可，不一定非得是你自己车辆的交强险。",

          "description": "前言\n有一段时间没有写钢笔相关的分享了，钢笔在几年内一直是我个人最大的业余爱好。在以往的文章分享和收到的一些咨询中，不少是基础性的使用问题，和对于产品的推荐需求。从我最早2018年开始分享，已经过去了几年，计划重新以入门-进阶-收藏-避坑的系列来和大家谈谈如今对钢笔爱好的个人见解，本篇主要分享钢笔的入门指导。\n还写字吗？为什么用钢笔写字？\n随着电子产品和通讯产品的发展，社会人对于书写的需求愈发减少了，书写已经是生活的非必要部分，书写工具都是非常成熟的工业化产品，进步空间和进步幅度也非常狭小。\n目前世界上最主流的书写工具，必然是中性笔，书写流畅，墨水干速快，书写速度快，使用寿命不错并且主流产品价格低廉。\n\n但以走珠出墨并与纸张接触的中性笔手感偏硬，缺少笔画表现力，在交互体验感上不足。\n在我国文化历史上，毛笔是核心的书写工具；在欧洲早期使用羽毛笔，工业化之后制作出了蘸水钢铁笔，这些天然和没有深度工业化加工的材料由于原材料本身书写形变程度更大，在书写表现力上的表现力更强，也传承着古典的书写仪式感。\n\n现代钢笔在18世纪80年代末由法国保险员威迪文先生发明，其产品核心是利用了毛细现象，制备了毛细管根据气压和笔压原理吸墨和供墨，搭配钢铁笔的笔尖进行书写。\n英文叫做Fountain Pen，意思书写时墨水可以像泉水一样自行流出，所以我国国标和行业内官方称其为自来水笔，本质就是欧洲早期钢铁笔和毛细系统结合而成的书写工具。\n\n自来水笔名字相对拗口，在汉字中又有歧义，所以如今商品名都叫钢笔，1995年出台的国标虽然老旧，但产品分类一定程度上还可以参考，根据笔尖材质分为钢尖和金尖，金尖钢笔也简称为金笔；钢笔笔尖状态，宏观分为暗尖和明尖。半明尖定位不清晰已经基本被弃用，弯尖在国内又称为美工尖，笔画表现力很强，但完全没办法日常使用，也不适合学生练字，所以基本告别了主流市场。\n\n首先，钢笔本身的墨水…",

          "description": "作为一个北方人，来南方的心愿之一就是亲眼看看大海，还记得 2001 年刚到深圳的时候，我跟同学本来应该去「福田」找工作，却阴差阳错的坐上了开往「盐田」的公交车，就这样稀里糊涂的坐到了盐田港。下车之后，查查手上的深圳地图（那时还没有手机），发现这里离大梅沙海滩似乎不远了，我俩一商量，不如先去看看大海吧，万一找不到工作回老家了，也少了一个人生遗憾。\n\n于是，我们从盐田港走到了大梅沙，盘山公路一弯接一弯，路很窄，汽车在身边飞驰而过。没想到地图上的一点距离，竟然有十多公里，精疲力尽之后，我俩终于见到了梦想的蓝海银滩，大家可能不知道，那时候的大梅沙海滩是有很多漂亮贝壳的，我们像孩子一样捡拾了很多。\n转眼几年之后，同学因为家庭原因，选择回到东北老家发展，而我继续留在深圳打拼，结婚生子之后，也搬到了南山，住到了蛇口老区。那时候，离我们最近的海边就是深圳湾。可惜当年的深圳湾可以说是臭气熏天，蛇口的各种废水直接排入海湾，只有靠近福田的的红树林公园稍微好一点。为了恢复深圳湾环境，深圳修了一个巨大的污水回流工程，截流蛇口半岛的生活污水，反向输送到南山脚下的专业污水处理厂。其中的一段工程就在我住的小区门口，从女儿出生到上小学，足足修了好多年。\n\n又过了几年，深圳湾大桥和深圳湾滨海公园都修好了，虽然有了漂亮的甬路和自行车道，没有了排污管道，但水质还没有真正改善，偶尔还是会飘来一阵阵臭味。那几年的我，正处在创业低谷，焦虑无奈，经常去深圳湾公园疯跑和呐喊，面朝大海，发泄内心郁闷的情绪。\n\n不知不觉又过了几年，深圳湾水质变清了，开始有了螃蟹，甚至偶尔看到小鱼，候鸟也越来越多，连接深圳湾的大沙河也全部治理成生态公园，成了人们休闲露营的好去处。我也经常带着孩子去深圳湾小沙滩堆城堡，去草坪休闲露营。回顾这二十年，深圳对环境的思考和改变，就像一个孩子，从犯错到知错，开始一点点的修正。我们见证了深圳湾的环境变化，它也保存了一群深圳人的成长记忆。\n\n前阵子，拜访了成立十年的「红树林基金会 MCF」，我才进一步了解到，整个海湾生态中，最重要的红树林已经很难恢复了，填海阔地改变了原有的海岸结构，并不是简单种树就能解决的。好在各方努力之下，在深圳河的边缘，还是保留了一片相对完整的林系，里面保护着各种候鸟，还有为数不多的豹猫和欧亚水獭。这也让它成为世界上少有的，摩登都市之下的生态湿地。\n\n二十年弹指一挥间，经过多年打拼，我们依然还是一个小企业，没有赚到多少钱，但也希望能为深圳环境做一点贡献，刚好少数派周边「发财水獭」上市，我们决定每销售一个水獭公仔，就捐赠 20 元给红树林基金会，用于更多的红树林湿地研究和科普保护工作。\n期待有一天，我们不在需要红外摄影机，也能在深圳湾看到成群的水獭嬉戏。",

          "description": "可能有很多朋友对拖挂很感兴趣，不过拖挂在我国还是一个小众的新事物，在2015年的时候，公安部才下发过《关于规范旅居挂车上路通行管理工作的通知》，要求保证拖挂房车上路的权利，也就是那时候各个地方基本没什么拖挂房车，以至于很多交警见了还以为是什么怪东西，扣下不给走。而直到今天，个别小城市还会碰到高速口不给拖挂房车上、交警盘查扣留拖挂房车的。\n今年4月1日起针对拖挂房车新增C6驾照的新闻大家应该也看到了，对拖挂房车感兴趣的朋友们应该也很想知道，C6驾照到底难不难考、自己已有的私家车能不能拉拖挂、相关法规又是怎么样的呢？\n先上结论：C6驾照对于有丰富驾驶经验的司机来说并不难；目前《道路交通法》对小型乘用车拉拖挂没有牵引资质的要求，任何小型乘用车（即微型车以外的家用车）都可以拉拖挂。\nC6驾照并不难考\n首先考C6驾照的要求是已经有C1或C2驾照一年以上，且年龄在20周岁以上、60周岁以下（通过测试后70周岁以下也可以），也就是没有驾照的人是不能直接考C6的，而对于有驾照、有驾驶经验的人来说，考C6并不难。\n\nC6的考试内容是桩考、弯道驾驶、直角转弯。\n桩考即倒车入库，分两次分别倒车入库到相邻的两个车位即可（从上图左边的H倒入右边的车位，再开到右边的H倒入左边的车位），车位中间是虚线且没有栏杆，前轮进入停止线前可以调整，不要求一次入库，熟悉一下车辆长度和宽度就行、并注意倒车要先反向打轮，是三个项目里最难的。\n\n弯道驾驶比较简单，考试用的挂车长度一般是4米，比市场上的主流拖挂房车要短很多，加上前车一般不到10米，注意内轮差就行。\n\n直角转弯应该是最简单的一项，路面宽度有5.7米，拖挂车的宽度是2米左右，练几次熟悉一下就可以了，没难度。\n考C6驾照最难的反而是报名，因为不是每个城市都能考C6，比如浙江目前就只有宁波和嘉兴能考，如果不在这两个地方还得把驾照先迁过去再报考，考完再迁回来，虽然交管APP上能操作，但也麻烦。价格方面每个地方的驾校也不一样，3800-9800的都有。\n什么车可以拉拖挂\n根据《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法实施条例》第56条，“小型载客汽车只允许牵引旅居挂车或者总质量700千克以下的挂车。挂车不得载人；”这里的旅居挂车指的就是拖挂房车，小型载客汽车指的是长度6米以内、载客人数9人以内的客车，但不包括微型汽车。也就是说大部分家用客车都可以拉拖挂，五菱宏光mini这种微型客车除外。\n​有一个常见的误解是前车必须要有牵引资质才可以拉拖挂房车，但实际上在《道路交通安全法》里是没有任何针对小型客车牵引旅居拖挂车牵引资质要求的，也就是任何家用车（微型车除外）都可以拉拖挂，不要求有牵引资质，虽然这和我们的常识及直觉相悖。\n\n \n不过在《国家标准 GB 7258-2017 机动车安全运行技术条件条文释义》4.16里有提到：“目前许多乘用车出厂前并未安装牵引装置，但为了牵引中置轴挂车而在出厂后加装牵引装置，这一做法违反了《道交法》。“但需要注意的是这个文件并不是法律条文，而是给汽车制造商、车管所看的，因此有部分车管所会依据这个解释，在拖挂房车上牌时明确要求前车要有牵引资质（如郑州），但在京沪等大部分城市是明确不需要的。对于明确需要前车有牵引资质才能上牌的城市，可以借一辆有牵引资质的车去给拖挂上牌或者去不要求牵引资质的车管所上牌即可。\n至于在上路之后，至少在目前交警也是不查前车牵引资质的，因为《道交法》并没有相关规定。可能有些地方的交警第一次遇到拖挂房车且不熟悉相关法规，会依据常识认为拉了拖挂前车当然要有牵引资质，这个时候和交警好好解释，交警再在对讲机里问问，都会放行的。\n造成这个现状也是和以前相关部门不重视机动车牵引资质有关，几乎只有少部分进口越野车才有牵引资质，国产车包括合资车想申请牵引资质都不知道在哪里申请，根本没有这个选项给你。当然近两年相关流程已经建立起来了。\n工信部在2022年4月25日就发了《关于规范具备牵引功能轻型汽车申报要求的通知》，要求有牵引能力的机动车应当申请牵引资质并做相关检测，然后在铭牌、公告、行驶证等地方体现出来。可以预见的是以后大概率会在《道交法》里新增拖挂房车前车牵引资质的要求，毕竟现在有很多小排量的小轿车在拉拖挂房车，存在道路安全隐患。",

          "description": "虽然在本文动笔之前高考还未结束，但在本文完成时高考应该已经结束多时，正是广大高中毕业生选择志愿的时候。所以，这篇文章的主要目的是提供有关物理学专业的专业选择指导。除此之外，如果你早已在其它行业功成名就，而又希望能领略如今物理学中人类的智慧光芒，那么本文也应能为你提供一些思路。本文作者为慕尼黑大学索末菲理论物理研究所在读博士，在物理学专业的学习和研究领域有丰富经验。本文将向大家介绍物理学专业的专业面貌、学习内容、就业去向及选择建议。\n什么是物理学？(认真)\n这是一个看起来很难回答的问题，因为它太 “大” 了 — 物理学是一个包罗万象、丰富多彩的学科，你似乎很难去用很简洁的话语把这些精彩纷呈的故事概括出来。但是我仍然要去讲这个问题。从我本人第一次认真接触前沿物理学算起到现在已经几乎十年了。这十年的经历给我的一个很深的感触之一，就是高中物理不是真正的物理。所以，对于只在中学阶段接触过物理学的许多读者来说，你们通过中学学习所获得的关于物理学的基本印象，与我从业将近十年所感受到的物理学有着几乎是云泥之别。所以，在作任何更细致的阐述之前，我希望能通过一些论述，向大家展示一下职业科研工作者眼中的物理学是何模样。\n如果你翻开高中物理学的教科书，你通常会在头几页的某个位置看到类似这样的一句话：物理学是研究物质运动、物质状态和物质间相互作用的一门学科。我不能说这句话是错的，只是它完全没能抓住物理学中最令人着迷的那些内涵。业内通常更喜欢著名期刊 Nature 官网上给物理学下的定义：\n\nPhysics is the search for and application of rules that can help us understand and predict the world. \n物理学寻找并应用一系列规律，这些规律帮助我们理解并预测这个世界。\n\n这句话虽然简单，但却精准描述了现代物理学…",

          "description": "背景\n\n近期，无意间重新翻阅了一下 Android 官方文档，发现文章的目录结构有不少改动的地方。我尝试从这些改动的地方，一探 Android App 架构的演进方向。当然文档中包含的主题有很多，本文主要从架构相关的主题进行介绍。\n官方文档中，中文与英文中的目录结构并不相同，英文版本结构更加合理，中文文档结构应该是翻译进度问题有所滞后。也正是由于这种滞后的现象，才可以更加方便的对比出官方对于各项技术的思考。\n下面我们就看下具体的差异点在什么地方。\n突出架构设计，独立为章节\n在中文版本的文档中，架构相关的内容散落在核心主题的各处，而在英文版本中则将架构部分单独抽成一个相对独立的部分。\n\n英文版本中相较于中文版本的改动主要有以下几点：\n新增 App architecture 章节，并且在核心主题（Core topics）之上；\n将核心主题中的新版架构指南、架构组件、导航内容放入架构章节；\n将最佳实践章节中的依赖注入放入架构章节；\n下面会对涉及的改动的部分做一个详细的展开。\n架构指南\n指南这部分在中文版本中无法在目录结构中无法直接索引，英文版本中则可以比较清晰的看到 UI Layer、Domain Layer、Data Layer 等内容。\n\n架构组件\n架构组件目前看是 Jetpack 系列组件的子集，包含大家日常过程中可能会经常使用到的组件。\n中文版本中，这部分是直接罗列；在英文版本中则是对其进行了分类。\nUI 相关的组件放到了 UI Layer 中，数据相关的则放到了 Data Layer 中。UI Layer 中对生命周期相关的内容做了个收敛。\n\nApp 入口（App Entry points）\nApp 入口这部分在中文版本中是没有定义的，在英文版本中则是把核心主题的 Activity 内容做了拆分。讲中文中的 Activity 原先内容中抽离出了额外的两部分：Shortcuts 和 App Widgets。Shortcuts调整成和 Activity 平级，都是 App 的入口，App Widgets 则是继续待在核心主题部分。\n\nApp 导航\nApp 导航部分英文版本也是中文版本做了一次梳理，逻辑更加清晰。除了包含 Jetpack 组件中的 Navigation 之外，还有 Fragment 、App Links 以及 ViewPager 等内容。\n\n依赖管理\n这部分内容基本上内容没有调整，仅仅是从最佳实践部分移动到App 架构部分。\n\nApp Startup\n这部分在中文版本中是在架构组件内，英文版本中是和依赖注入、App导航等内容是平级的关系，这也是比较好理解的。\n大胆预测\n根据个人理解，英文版本中的组织结构应该也不是最终版本，也会不断更新的。我个人觉得后面还会有相关的知识点会纳入到 App 架构的章节中。下面就是我个人的大胆预测。\nData Layer 中会新增 Room 库，当然可能不仅仅会新增 Room 库，整个数据及文件部分都有可能移入到 Data Layer 中，目前 Room 库也是在数据及文件部分的。\nApp 入口部分加入 App Widgets/Glance 及 Service 部分，App Widgets 比较好理解，在技术方面他是和 App Shortcuts 类似的东西，对外暴露的 Service，也可以当做是 App 的入口，当然这部分也可以当做是代码块调用的入口。\n整体结构如下：\n\n总结\n通过对比中英版本文档，我们可以看到官方文档对各个知识点组织方式的演进方向。除了 App 的分层架构之外，还在逐步完善 App 整体架构。\n也是期望通过这次对官方文档的梳理，能够将 Jetpack 中常用的一些组件库在大家的脑海中建立一个网状关系，知道知识与知识之间的关系及链接，建立自己的知识网络。",

Its decision today on West Virginia v.

The layoffs — first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by TechCrunch — are the latest job losses at Tesla after CEO Elon Musk told company execs that the firm needed to reduce its headcount by about 10 percent. \nThe layoffs centered on Tesla’s offices in San Mateo, California, where employees were working on the company’s driver-assistance feature Autopilot. Many of those affected were reportedly hourly workers tasked with labeling training data. Such work is essential for developing AI systems but often low-skilled and low-paid.

Whether centering on a white-eyed Zosterop or confrontational Spereo Starling, his portraits are minimal with monochromatic backdrops that accentuate the distinct colors and patterns of each plume.\nThe ongoing series, titled An Incomplete Dictionary of Show Birds, originated with Stephenson wanting to photograph budgies but was intrigued by other species when he met some of his future subjects and their owners.

She then renders large-scale pieces of affectionate couples, children, and figures with extraordinarily kind and welcoming faces, expressions that contrast the largely subversive and politically charged messages synonymous with street art.
