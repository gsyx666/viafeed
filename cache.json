          "description": "Apple Watch Series 7 是近年变化最大的一代 Apple Watch，也是变化没那么大的一代。变化之大在于，Apple Watch Series 7 是继 Apple Watch Series 4 之后设计改动最大的一代：屏幕更大、边框更窄，还有全新配色的表壳；说它变化不大，是因为相比老款，这代产品几乎没有新的硬件与配套功能。\n颜色方面，不锈钢和钛金属版本的表款与之前相比没有什么变化，铝金属表款的配色则有了全新的 5 种选项，分别为午夜色、星光色、绿色、新款蓝色和红色，部分配色与 iPhone 13 以及新款 iPad mini 类似。\n\n比如午夜色表壳，仔细观察会有一种极深的蓝色的质感，绿色表壳颜色偏深，不仔细看的话反而会有一种接近黑色的质感，也能比较好地融入日常搭配。\n左：午夜色表壳 | 右：绿色表壳绿色表壳\n星光色表壳则与 iPad mini 的星光色类似，相比之前的银色表款色彩的层次表现更加出色，不同光线之下可能会有金色或者粉色的呈现效果。\n星光色表壳\n蓝色和红色是经过重新设计的 2 款配色。其中蓝色相比之前的版本颜色更浅更亮，有种更加轻快活泼的感觉；新款的红色给人的感觉又会更加「深沉」。\n蓝色表壳红色表壳\n戴上 Apple Watch Series 7，这块「全面屏」带来的视觉冲击感受还是足够让人印象深刻：紧贴表壳边缘的(轮廓表盘) 时标刻度，加上因为光线反射带来的「曲面」显示效果，这块 Apple Watch 给人的第一印象可以用「惊艳」来形容。\n轮廓表盘\n没错，这块手表的显示屏幕依然是一块直屏，利用弧形表镜产生的光线反射现象，通过侧面观察，能够看到时标刻度浮在屏幕边缘，让人产生这是一块「曲面屏」的错觉。\n\n如果不是放在一起比较，我不太能感受得到 41 毫米的新表款相比 40 毫米的老表款大了多少，毕竟 Apple Watch Series 7 的高度和宽度仅比之前多了 1 毫米 (41 毫米表款)。不过，如果将 2 款产品放在一起，Apple Watch Series 7 的「全面屏」会给人一种手表「大了不少」的错觉。\nApple Watch Series 7 / SE / Series 3\n除了上面提到的 41 毫米表款，根据官网给出的规格参数，45 毫米版本表款的高度比老款多了 1 毫米，2 个尺寸的表款厚度均为 10.7 毫米，与前代产品没有差别。\n重量方面，铝金属、不锈钢、钛金属 3 种表壳表款的重量均比前代产品更重。其中，41 毫米版本的 3 种表款分别重了 1.5 克、2.6 克、2.4 克，45 毫米版本的 3 种表款分别重了 2.3 克、4.4 克、3.8 克。理论上看，新款 Apple Watch 的重量变化几乎可以忽略不计，也与我的佩戴感受相当；不过，对于手表重量的感知程度因人而异，在意重量不妨等到 10 月 15 日手表上市之后去店里戴戴看。\nApple Watch Series 7 配备的同样是一块 LTPO 全天候视网膜屏，亮度与前代产品一致可达 1000 尼特。不同的是在非抬手亮屏状态下，新款手表的显示亮度有了显著提升，表盘上的信息变得更好读了。根据官网介绍，非抬手亮屏状态的亮度最高提升了 70%。不过，目前来看，我对于息屏显示的亮度提升没有特别大的感知，需要更长时间的使用与体验，观察这项功能提升的实际效果。\n息屏显示状态\n性能方面，在 Apple Watch Series 7 上使用 App 反应同样十分灵敏，各种 App 的打开速度、交互反馈都很及时，但与 Apple Watch Series 6 相比，没有明显变化。\n有趣的是，根据官方数据，Apple Watch Series 7 搭载的是一枚 64 位双核 S7 芯片，速度最快比搭载 S5 芯片的 Apple Watch SE 快了 20%；而 S6 芯片的运行速度，根据此前给出的数据，同样比 S5 芯片最快提升了 20%，似乎间接证明了 S7 芯片在性能方面与 S6 芯片相比没有提升。\n结合 Apple Watch Series 7 具有更大的显示屏幕和更高的息屏显示亮度的特性，且续航时间相比前代产品没有变化，S7 芯片应该是专注于在能耗与功耗方面进行优化，以抵消这部分特性带来的额外功耗。\n由于拿到 Apple Watch Series 7 的时间很短，对于续航、充电速度以及新功能等方面的体验，我们还没能实现完整的测试和体验，也欢迎你通过 网站 / 客户端、公众号、微博 继续关注少数派，第一时间获取我们后续的完整体验内容。\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "极客时间四周年的时候搞了个活动，让作者们都写一点最近的思考，我想了想，就写了一些关于“眼界”的。这个话题其实我以前也有写到，但是随着阅历的增加，这个词正变得越来越重要。我写的那几段话是：\n“每个人都有自己不同的能力和特质，有的是先天具备的，比如有的人天生就记忆力出色；有的是后天努力的，比如通过坚持不懈的奋斗做成一件大事。可是，有的特质却既非先天可具备，又非后天可努力得到，在我们朴素的教育背景中，它们往往总被忽略。它们的其中一个，就是眼界。在投资领域，大概有这样一句话，把一个问题如果放到十年、二十年的维度上去看，问题就会简单很多。倒不是说要宣扬佛系心态，而是说，要有够大的眼界，能够‘忽略’掉那些纷纷扰扰的细枝末节，而专注于主要的因素。”\n\n\n\n\n\n“毕业工作以来，随着经验的积累，我的心态也在不断变化。在我刚踏入职场的时候，我对自己特别自信，我相信自己具备足够的天赋能够成功；几年之后，我觉得自己通过坚持和努力能够做到自己梦想的事情；而现在，我越来越觉得，眼界，似乎是它才能决定一个人长久职业发展的天花板。一些人能够做到足够大的事情，一个必不可少的原因是他们其实本来就已经站得够高，本来就见过很多世面，有了足够开阔的眼界，毕竟单靠天赋和努力，再怎样潜心奋斗，螺丝钉也不能成为决定整个机器运转的关键零件。”\n\n\n\n\n\n“而有意思的是，所谓眼界，是需要不断去新的领域和环境尝试、经历，才能慢慢开阔的，而一个人愿意去做出尝试的意愿，恰恰又是从很小时候就培育的心态所决定的，那是不是可以说，一个人的天花板在哪里，对于这样的问题，很可能从小、从成长环境，甚至从父母那里，就能找到这个答案呢？”\n\n\n\n\n我不知道你怎样想，在我的认知里，至少对于绝大多数人来说，我从来不相信一个人的未来是无限可能的，但是我却有无法说出，到底所谓的天花板，所谓的边界，到底是谁限定的。后来我慢慢感受到了，可能这个边界，就是每个人的父母、每个人的生活环境所限定的。\n简单来说，人活得越久，就越能看到自己父母的影子。我最近忽然发现，我的性格、我的长处，我的短处，我对问题的思考方法，我对于某些现状的不安和挣扎，甚至我在某些问题上的软弱和放弃，以及不够豁达的气度，都在我的父母身上找到了影子。\n我不知你有没有这样的想法，这确实有点让我感到灰心丧气。如果一个人的努力让自己成长，但是却在这个过程中慢慢看到了自己难以跳出的边界，这很难不对自己保持希望的心态有所打击。但人的成长可能就是这样的一个过程，每个人都一样，你不可能永远都是充满希望的潜质新人。\n稍稍思考一下原因，也许能找到一些合理的解释。比方说，如果从小父母身体力行，就都是对细节把握得扎实，做事认真严谨，甚至完美主义，那么很可能他们的孩子也具备了这样优秀的特质，但另一方面，也很有可能这样的人不容易拿得起放得下，无法豁达地生活。无论好坏，这样的特质可以说是深深地镌刻在性格里的，是真正决定一个人可能性上限的，是非常非常难以改变的。\n当然，话说回来，每个人都有自己与众不同的小倔强，这个倔强可能让自己在这边界所确定的大框架下，有一点自己小小的特立独行。兴许，每个人“应当”做的，就是尽力去认识清楚自己究竟是怎样一个人，然后才看看什么事、哪些事才是自己适合做的。\n那么，怎么才能够认识清楚自己呢？我觉得这就要回到一开始的那个关键词——“眼界”上面来了。这就好像当人只待在地球上的时候，是很难准确说出地球的形状的，只有到了太空，才能看到地球是球形的。眼界越开阔，就越能够认清自己。我觉得这是眼界给每个人自己带来的最大价值。",

          "description": "现在非法使用军服仿制品的行为不少。大街小巷，非军人穿着迷彩服的现象几乎每天都能看到，这是很不严肃的。尤其是工地上，非军人穿迷彩服的可能更多，尽管没有配上军衔和军种符号，但非常碍眼。到了冬天，迷彩军大衣又成为非军人比较喜欢穿的衣服。\n对于军服的日常管理，早在2009年，国务院就发布第547号令，出台《军服管理条例》，自2009年3月1日起施行，全文共20条。\n其中第九至十八条规定如下：\n第九条  现役军人以及依照法律、法规和军队有关规定可以穿着军服的人员，应当依照有关规定穿着军服。军队警备执勤人员应当加强检查、纠察，及时纠正违法穿着军服的行为。影视制作和文艺演出单位的演艺人员因扮演军人角色需要穿着军服的，应当遵守军队关于军服穿着的规定，不得损害军队和军人形象。非拍摄、演出时不得穿着军服。\n第十条  禁止买卖、出租或者擅自出借、赠送军服。禁止使用军服和中国人民解放军曾经装备的制式服装从事经营活动。禁止以“军需”、“军服”、“军品”等用语招揽顾客。\n第十一条  机关、团体、企业事业单位和其他组织的制式服装及其标志服饰，应当与军服有明显区别。禁止生产、销售、购买和使用仿照军服样式、颜色制作的足以使公众视为军服的仿制品。\n第十二条  违反本条例规定，有下列情形之一的，由工商行政管理部门没收违法物品和违法所得，处1万元以上10万元以下的罚款；违法经营数额巨大的，吊销营业执照；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任：（一）非法生产军服、军服专用材料的；（二）买卖军服、军服专用材料的；（三）生产、销售军服仿制品的。工商行政管理部门发现涉嫌非法生产、销售军服或者军服仿制品的行为时，可以查封、扣押涉嫌物品。\n第十三条  军服承制企业违反本条例规定，有下列情形之一的，由工商行政管理部门责令改正，处1万元以上5万元以下的罚款；拒不改正的，责令停业整顿：（一）转让军服、军服专用材料生产合同或者生产技术规范，或者委托其他企业生产军服、军服专用材料的；（二）销售或者以其他方式转让未经改制、染色等处理的军服、军服专用材料残次品的；（三）未将军服生产中剩余的军服专用材料妥善保管、移交的。具有前款规定情形之一的，军队军需主管部门应当将其从军服承制企业备选名录中除名，并不得再列入军服承制企业备选名录。\n第十四条 军服承制企业的工作人员泄露军服专用材料生产技术，或者军服承制、承运企业的工作人员泄露军服、军服专用材料生产、运输数量以及接收单位等涉及国家秘密的信息，构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n第十五条 违反本条例规定，使用军服和中国人民解放军曾经装备的制式服装从事经营活动，或者以“军需”、“军服”、“军品”等用语招揽顾客的，由工商行政管理部门责令改正，没收违法物品和违法所得，并处2000元以上2万元以下的罚款；拒不改正的，责令停业整顿。\n第十六条 穿着军服或者军服仿制品冒充军人招摇撞骗的，由公安机关依法给予治安管理处罚；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n第十七条 公务员和现役军人在军服管理工作中滥用职权、玩忽职守、徇私舞弊的，依法给予处分；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。现役军人出租或者擅自出借、赠送军服的，依照《中国人民解放军纪律条令》的规定给予处分。\n第十八条 对公安机关、工商行政管理部门查获的军服仿制品的认定存在争议的，由省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门鉴定。公安机关、工商行政管理部门依法没收的军服、军服专用材料，应当移交省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门；依法没收的军服仿制品，应当按照国家有关规定处理。\n由此可见，非军人着军服，是有严格限定的，影视演员在拍摄相关作品时，可以穿相应的军服，但非拍摄时，不能着军服。\n所以在守护戎装上，一是要加强《军服管理条例》的宣传普及，让人民群众知道军服到底能不能穿，非军人穿着军服会有什么后果。二是对军服承制企业，要加强督查和严格约束，除了向军队供货，不得将承制的军服或仿制军服向地方销售。三是对经营户，省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门、公安机关、工商行政管理部门要加大执法力度，对售卖军服的经营户，及时处罚和制止。四是军人也要严格要求自己，穿旧的军服，要按规定处理，不要给家人或亲友穿。五是退役军人着军服，也要按照规定和时机执行，不能像在军营一样穿着军服。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n东部战区\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n军服上那些花花绿绿的块块是有什么特殊含义吗？\n怎么看美国陆军将换新军装，改回二战时期“粉绿”军服？",

          "description": "中国文艺网时评丨从艺先做人是文艺工作者的终身必修课\n\n\n近日，钢琴家李云迪因涉嫌嫖娼被北京朝阳警方依法行政拘留，曾经享誉国际的“钢琴王子”如今踩踏了道德底线与法律红线，其行径遭到了社会和大众的一致谴责，同时引起了行业深思。大众谴责的不仅是身为“明星”的李云迪行为失范，更是身为“艺术家”的李云迪德不配位。文艺工作者可以“跨界”但不能“越线”。作为当红的顶流文艺工作者，相较于娱乐明星拥有更高的公共权威，艺术家的价值观念、审美情趣对受众的影响更为深远。“从艺先做人”、重“修心”早已是艺术家的必修之功课、终身之功课，也是艺术之所以成为艺术、启迪心灵的内在动力。人们常常将艺术家的技艺与品德相联系，艺术家一旦有不良行为，对受众主流价值观的解构程度，以及社会良好风气的破坏程度十分巨大。\n“艺术家”“天才少年”“钢琴王子”李云迪跌落神坛，令人分外扼腕，冷静分析德不配位的深层原因，与其以身体的“欲望”取代精神的“愉悦”，以名利的追逐取代人格的修养，以华丽人设取代“道器”的修持，以本能的放纵取代理性的克制有很大关系。李云迪少年成名，年仅18岁时便已获得第14届肖邦国际钢琴比赛冠军，次年便登上央视春晚舞台，成为家喻户晓的钢琴艺术家，近年来，李云迪更是频频“跨界”成为了综艺节目的常客。但李云迪的专业水准并未随着名气的增长而精进，相反，李云迪的演奏状态持续下降，在公开演奏会中失误频频，“钢琴家”的头衔似乎成为其娱乐明星身份的精美“人设”。艺术家“跨界”无可厚非，但流量应与技艺相匹配，名气应与品德旗鼓相当，秉承艺术家的身份却一味沉湎于追逐热钱，不仅是对个人精神的蚕食，同时也是对文艺工作者群体公信力的消减；而其跨越法律与道德红线的嫖娼行为，不仅是对社会核心价值观的一种亵渎，更是对公序良俗的一种践踏。\n李云迪事件的警示意义远远超出其自身，对于文艺工作者的规范必须各方联合发力。首先，文艺工作者自身要汲取教训、引以为戒，真正做到德才兼备、才高行洁，耐得住文艺工作“高处不胜寒”的寂寞。因为文艺工作者的言行直接影响着大众价值观与审美情趣的塑造，特别是在网络媒介生态下，文艺工作者的言行举止都将被媒介放大，严以修身、知行合一和引领示范是广大文艺工作者安身立命的必修课。其次，规范各文化企业和社交平台对明星艺人的曝光范围，要划定和提升曝光门槛，逐步建立专业与道德“档案”，专注宣传专业精深、德艺双馨的文艺工作者。对于以“艺术家”头衔博眼球、赚快钱而放松其道德品质与专业修养的明星艺人，我们不能为其慷慨提供舞台和平台，不能为了市场飘红而放弃立场底线，对于一手赚钱一手推墙者必须予以严惩和打击，守护好文艺界的正气清风，才是文化产业良性循环的正道。第三，各级文联协会要履行职能，发挥引导作用，加大培训力度，加强行业风气监管，既要敢于亮剑作为，也要善于引导示范，努力营造积极健康的文艺生态。总之，只有不断加强法纪教育和法律文化普及，提升道德修为与审美修养，文艺工作者才能让自己具备引领时代风尚的资格与能力。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国文艺网\n点击下载\n10 个回答，查看全部。\n中国音乐家协会钢琴考级可以弹中央音乐学院的曲子么？\n作为一个天津音乐学院钢琴系的学生，想要做钢琴家教，如何能找到人脉介绍学生？",

          "description": "《宇宙跃迁者》这本书，是我“折叠宇宙”系列六部曲的第一部。\n在这本书里，我希望探索中式科幻——中国古典美、武侠与科幻的结合。这个方向很难，因为科幻代表着刚硬冰冷的科技和快速变化的未来，很少能和悠长静美的古典美相结合。但是我很爱中国古代文化和美学，很希望将它们也带到未来，而不会被时光尘封掩埋。\n中国古典美，第一在于洗练；第二在于高洁。这都可以和科幻结合。\n想将中国文化带入科幻的另一重尝试，是对于传统文化本身的理解翻新。无论是典籍，还是经典技艺，都可以在科幻的语境中获得另一番呈现。\n当我们合上小说，从完全虚构的世界里跳出来，问我们自己一句：如果没有外星人奇迹，该如何理解我们中国先人的伟大成就？答案是：尚有很多未解之谜。\n这种情况下，你就可以理解，为什么我要写这样一本小说——用故事中杜撰的传奇，来衬托现实中历史的神奇浩瀚。在没有外来力量相助的情况下，中华民族做出了如此大的成就，这是多么了不起的奇迹呀。\n于是我很想把那些伟大的经典写下来，写到现在与未来。\n\n书中涉及的经典：（涉及到的器物和典籍大概包括这些）\n\n“惟皇上帝，降衷于下民。”出自于《尚书·商书·汤诰》。《尚书》是最古老的历史典籍。“道冲而用之或不盈，渊兮似万物之宗。挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。湛兮其若存，吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。”这是我在《道德经》中最喜欢的一段话。和光同尘，吾归万物。\n“非攻”：墨家的核心主张。最早出自墨子与公输班的虚拟对决，一攻一防，精彩纷呈。在鲁迅先生的《故事新编》里有描述。\n玉琮：是良渚文化出土的重要礼器，工艺发达，造型精美，上面的人神兽面纹是后世很多纹理的起源。良渚文化的发达和突然消失至今在考古学领域成谜。良渚文化村环境优美，值得访问。\n青铜：中国的青铜器在二里头发源，发源之初就是成熟发达的器型，独特的工艺。商周青铜礼器是世界古代历史的璀璨瑰宝。它的起源和发展脉络至今有很多未解之处。安阳殷墟…",

          "description": "6个月在轨驻留与3个月相比，时间长度就是他们最大的挑战。\n相比于神舟十二号航天员在轨驻留3个月，这次神舟十三号的在轨驻留时间直接增加了一倍。在空间微重力的影响下，宇航员骨量的减少、肌肉的萎缩以及神经系统的弱化，这三个影响会放大一倍。三名航天员要在太空停留6个月是为了考核、验证目前所采取的抵抗措施是否有效。\n未来从神舟十四号开始，要实现中国空间站不间断有航天员驻留。这样的话，空间站正常的乘组轮换将会是半年一轮换。目前，只有验证这些措施有效，才敢进入一个正常的运营阶段。\n此次航天飞行过程中，三名宇航员将进行两到三次出舱活动，这也是为了进一步夯实航天员出舱活动方面的能力和技术。出舱活动本身的技术较为复杂，要求较高。虽然我国载人航天已进行过多次出舱活动，但此次出舱活动将进行更为复杂的操作任务。\n此次飞行任务中航天员要安装能够将大小机械臂连接在一起的适配器以及悬挂系统，这是一个非常复杂的过程。对标国外，出舱已经成为一个完全常规的操作，所以在这方面还要进一步夯实技术基础。\n神舟十三号载人飞行任务是空间站关键技术验证阶段第六次飞行任务，也是该阶段最后一次飞行任务。飞行任务中将开展机械臂辅助舱段转位、手控遥操作等空间站组装建造关键技术试验，这项技术对于未来可靠建造空间站非常重要。这将会是航天员在太空中很有挑战的一项任务，要严密地在轨监视机械臂辅助进行转位的状态。\n径向对接，要求更严，中国是第一次这样做。\n不同于以往的神舟系列飞船采取的前、后两个方向停靠空间站，按计划，神舟十三号飞船入轨后，将采用自主快速交会对接模式，对接于天和核心舱径向端口，与天和核心舱及天舟二号、天舟三号货运飞船形成组合体。\n那么，径向停靠和前、后两种停靠方式有何不同？神舟飞船进入轨道以后要和空间站进行对接，对接的过程如果两者在同一轨道上，只是前后位置不一样，它是一个稳定的位置关系。由于轨道动力学的特点，如果飞船是从下方去接近空间站，就意味着飞船和空间站处在不同高度，处在不同轨道上。它的位置关系不是稳定的，相对于前后向对接，这种对接要求更严格，对时间的把握要更准确。中国第一次这样做，所以有一定难度。\n为什么要抛弃前后向对接而采用更加复杂的径向对接？因为空间站不可能所有的对接口都在前向和后向，尤其是未来基本上后向对接口会长期被天舟货运飞船占用。而且未来如果要实现中国航天员在太空不间断驻留，就意味着前一个乘组完成任务以后并不能直接返回地球，而是等后一个乘组来了以后，他们在轨进行任务交接，前一个乘组才能返回地球。这就意味着，短时间要有六个人两艘飞船对接到空间站上。前后向对接口可能已经被占用的情况下，只能选择径向对接口。这是未来空间站建设必须要掌握的技术。\n对比神舟十二号载人飞行任务，虽然说大的任务表面上和神舟十二号相似，但是神舟十三号的每一项任务其实更有技术含量，难度更高，更有挑战性。\n女航天员要首次进驻中国空间站。\n航天员王亚平将成为首次进驻中国空间站的中国女航天员，她也将成为中国首位实施出舱活动的女航天员。\n空间站的功能主要是进行各类科学研究，在科学研究层面，航天医学是这些研究中的重要项目。航天医学中既有对男性的研究也有对女性的研究。女航天员的存在，也是空间站运营的需求。由于长期处于封闭空间，男女搭配对于解决很多心理问题有好处。有女性航天员存在，也有助于研究未来更长时间的太空飞行中航天员的心理问题。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国航天科工\n点击下载\n371 个回答，查看全部。\n神舟十二号航天员开展中国空间站首次出舱活动，主要完成哪些任务？长时间舱外作业有哪些难度和危险？\n中国新一代载人飞船试验船返回舱开舱，舱里都带了些啥？下次你还希望可能带些啥？",

          "description": "近年来，一些艺人仗着粉丝和市场，屡屡顶风违纪，成为社会公序良俗的破坏者和疮疤毒瘤。事实证明，抵制这些劣迹艺人，光靠温馨提示般的行业自律和呼吁倡议，力度已经远远不够，必须各方联合发力，架好带电“高压线”，长出锋利的“牙齿”，方可奏效。\n首先，要划定和提升行业准入门槛，建立完善退出机制。文娱行业或视听行业是生产精神食粮的行业，行业的从业人员素质决定了产品的整体质量，从业人员的审美导向影响着消费者的价值取向。可以说，有什么样的人品就会有什么样的作品，有什么样的立场就会有什么样的市场，有什么样的素质就会有什么样的品质。但是，当下文娱行业或视听行业准入门槛很低，致使从业者泥沙俱下、良莠不齐。应该尽快建立文娱产业的准入门槛，更要建立完善退出机制，对于违法乱纪、越过底线者，及时、随时做出反应，拿出办法，有效清理。\n 其次，要从侧重结果管理转为侧重过程管理。抵制劣迹艺人的频繁出现，还需多方联合发力，变事后处置为事前和事中监管，从侧重结果管理转为侧重过程管理，从而在抓早和抓小中做好预防工作。一部作品创作前期对参与创作艺人的道德法纪把关和行为评估很有必要，在创作中期对多头轧戏、乱改剧本、态度傲慢等问题的监管同样不可或缺，在创作后期更应针对不合适的内容及宣发及时调整，对明星团队和粉丝互撕等恶性行为及时介入。这样可以有效避免创作投入和社会资源的浪费，更可以最大程度规避对文艺生态可能带来的伤害。\n再次，要从源头根本加强管控力度。劣迹艺人之所以能被粉丝们前呼后拥，离不开资本与平台的炒作，拉踩引战、攀比炫富、人肉搜索、刷榜控评等现象，归根结底都是资本追求增值的手段。斩断资本推手，管住无良平台，取消劣迹艺人表演的空间，划出平台生存的底线和红线，那么劣迹艺人的影响力和破坏力自然就会灰飞烟灭。\n最后，要强化艺人的职业教育。一些从业人员政治素养不高、法律意识淡薄、道德观念滑坡，违法失德言行之所以时有发生，与职业教育的长期忽略和不够全面也不无关系。不少艺人在职前教育阶段就存在只重专业训练、轻思想道德引领的问题，在职后教育阶段又缺乏正确的行业引领与规范，导致浮躁、拜金，只认流量和钱，心口不一和知行错位现象比较普遍。要从内心深处改变，职前和职后的培训教育必须加强，而且要划出底线和高线，打通培训和监管之间的壁障，让培训和监管“长牙”“带电”，不能流于形式，不能走过场，不能一味“温良恭俭让”。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国文艺网\n点击下载\n3085 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价宋冬野发布5月9日新版《郭源潮》？\n如何评价网易云下架宋冬野除《安和桥北》和新歌《郭源潮》外歌曲？",

          "description": "国产游戏《仙剑奇侠传 7》已发售，你的体验如何？ \n知乎的各位朋友大家好，感谢知乎的邀请，分享我对《仙剑奇侠传七》想法。\n\n\n《仙剑奇侠传七》的目标\n在立项之初说过仙七的创作目标之一，是想给玩家类似当年仙三的感觉，意思是“游历六界“。七代故事舞台跨人魔神三界，和明庶门、天师门、仙霞派等新老仙门，主角群都是年轻有为的新人物，也根据剧情需要有几位前作人物以大佬身份登场提携后辈。九泉中尚未登场的炎波、照胆、春滋、毒瘴等将一次呈现。可以说这是一部继往开来、新老融合，进一步延伸且整合世界观的作品。\n\n\n\n\n\n仙剑七之后，我们除了继续做下一代之外，还会推出多部长篇漫画来扩充和补全仙剑系列的人和事，从更多不同的视角和时间线向大家介绍仙剑世界。\n\n\n格物致知\n情与义是仙剑的情感核心，不同于欧美的个人英雄主义，我们中国人主张的是团队合作的力量，所以仙剑的故事向来是群像，过去回合制适合团队作战，改成ARPG之后，如何也能做出多主角并肩作战的感觉就成了我们要攻克的难题，虽然这在国外游戏并非新鲜事，但目前国内单机比较少见，而且多做一个可操作战斗的主角意味要多一倍这部分的投入，有可能是个吃力但不一定讨好的道路，而且我们过去没做过。但是我们认为这样能更好的体现伙伴的感觉，和避免玩家从头到尾只能操作一名主角的单调，所以还是咬牙朝这个坑跳下去。\n\n\n\n\n\n不同主角的打法设计，如何流畅的切换角色，男女主角合击等，要从一张白纸开始积累经验，总要跨出第一步。法乎其上，得乎其中，现在我们也建立起了一套多角色ARPG系统，也许还不完美，但是我们会根据玩家的反馈继续提高。\n\n\n跳既是坑\n跳，又是另一个坑。为了提供探索乐趣，这代地图刻意做的较大，地形起伏也复杂。加入自由跳跃之后场景测试修改的负担大增，而且是跳这么高，跑这么快的。开发途中我们一度遇到困难而纠结，但是这样能让玩家玩跑地图时更自由、更爽快，更像一名身手不凡的大侠，那我们就还是咬牙朝这个坑跳下去吧，花更多倍精力去解决。顺便透露一下~完成各地图中隐藏的跳跃任务也是玩家获得隐藏御灵\"小柒”的条件之一。\n\n\n\n\n\n技术探索\n如何用UE4做出适合仙剑的风格、如何呈现魔界、如何表现织物上的刺绣、整体色调如何迎合东方的审美……等等。在非光追显卡下如何运用光照烘培让场景更好看，以及在光追显卡下如何发挥光追的优势让光影更美。在这些方面我们做了很多尝试，早期也走了很多弯路，但也收获许多宝贵经验。\n\n\n\n\n\n目睹显卡荒，以及为了坚持让GTX 960显卡的玩家也能玩，我们为效能优化做了大量工作，也感谢各技术合作方的大力支持。我们也看到玩家对云游戏的需求，为手机端云游戏定制手机专用UI的版本，让PC显卡达不到最低配的玩家也能使在手机或智能电视上体验到画面精美且流畅的仙剑七。\n\n\n开放共创\n仙剑不是一个人的仙剑，是大家多年不弃的支持才能不断发展。我们始终相信广大玩家的力量，也欢迎大家共同创作。因为游戏是UE4制作，会使用UE4工具的同人大神们应不难制作仙剑7的MOD。我们对仙七的同人创作与之前的同人版权规范保持一致，未来并将推出资源编辑器，和仙剑共创UGC社区，届时欢迎大家捧场参与创作。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n姚仙\n点击下载\n541 个回答，查看全部。\n怎么评价 iOS 平台的仙剑奇侠传 5 ？\n如何看待古剑奇谭登陆steam？",

          "description": "1.北京故宫\n生就南人面孔，幸为帝都子民，幼时俯仰即视的前门箭楼、萦绕耳畔的广场旗乐至今依稀脑海，忘不了头顶的鸽哨嗡嗡，剪不断身后的虫吟声声，哦，还有每在冬日映入眼帘的蜂窝煤和冬储大白菜，可当它们寥寥无几时，绚烂的春光便徐徐而至了—我敝帚自珍的此般胡同情怀虽是难以名状，却始终镌刻在我心灵的最深处。\n\n其实，北京让我自豪的还有它文化之都的荣光！7项世界遗产冠绝寰球，颐和园、长城、十三陵、天坛、周口店遗址、大运河遗址名播海外，而其中最为杰出的代表便是作为明清两代皇宫、历经600载沧桑的北京故宫。我此番故地重游非是蹭川普访华的热点，而是光顾诸多亚欧名宫之后“蓄谋已久”的计划。作为占地7.6平方公里的北京皇城的核心宫城，灿若星辉的紫禁宫阙严整的布局、恢弘的气势足以令台北故宫的珍玩，京都御苑的素雅，昌德宫的别致，泰王宫的佛韵，卢浮宫、凡尔赛宫的奢靡，宁芬堡、天鹅堡的婀娜，圣彼得堡冬夏宫的壮观和克里姆林宫的庄严相形见绌，鳞次栉比的9999间宫殿（实测8700余间，不及乾隆年间最盛时的20000多间）、林林总总180万件先秦以来历代文物和洋洋洒洒万千言都难以描绘的宫廷传奇故事，都足以让它傲视天下，堪为中华乃至世界文明的瑰宝。\n\n毕竟是重游，我避开熙攘的三大殿、后三宫，五凤楼展览的千里江山图令我壮怀激烈；文华殿的陶瓷馆、武英殿的书画展让人印象深刻；东华门和东南角楼更是30年来首次踏入，还有如今辟为雕塑馆的寿康宫新近开放，平添了我不同以往的意趣。\n\n特别是京城最美时节的余温尚未散尽，一抹秋阳、一地金黄、一渊碧水和一袭红墙皆宛若画卷，不枉我一身轻装、一腔热血、一份执念和一世痴狂。\n2.北京云阳仙境\n每每在秋天醉人的季节，心里都蓦的想起郁达夫《故都的秋》中对于藏了京城最浓秋意之处的描写：“陶然亭的芦花，钓鱼台的柳影，西山的虫唱，玉泉的夜月，潭柘寺的钟声”，既然长于南国，不甘《沉沦》（郁达夫另一名作）的萌生先生（郁达夫的号）尚且如此钟爱北京的秋色，那么生于都门长于京华的我更应该早一天扑向那金黄的世界了！\n\n驱车北顾2小时，映入眼帘的是昔日边塞层峦叠嶂、枫林尽染的山林：从墨绿、青黄、金黄、橘黄到火红，似乎上帝也沉醉在这饱含诗意的季节里而无意中打翻了调色板，让我们有幸在碧空如洗的天际和柔美和煦的阳光下欣赏这幅壮美的画卷！\n\n听罢小溪潺潺，踏过缤纷落叶，轻享秋风送爽，忘归幽兰空谷。这一抹醉人山色，总教人难以忘记！\n\n3.北京居庸关长城\n恍然若梦二十载，金秋再叩居庸关。\n苍穹俯瞰九边地，万方游客万重山。\n峡谷漫道车如簇，晴空叠翠凭云帆。\n狼烟铁马今不现，但留雄浑在人间。\n\n始建于秦代、驰名于金代、复建于明代的居庸关长城因其险峻的地势、险要的位置而名满天下。而今遗世独立的关城不仅靠着“居庸叠翠”的壮美风光跻身“燕京八景”，而且它深厚的历史积淀和人类文化史上的典型意义早在上个世纪九十年代初便被联合国教科文组织关注，最终作为万里长城的精华被列入世界遗产名录。\n\n最为难能可贵的是，相对于八达岭长城摩肩接踵的地狱级游览模式，此地虽也游人络绎，却不至拥挤，堪为五洲四海倾慕长城人士的首选之所！\n\n4.慕田峪长城\n设施完备的慕田峪长城在疫情之前是个人潮汹涌的景区，与吸引国内游客的八达岭长城不同，这里的金发碧眼者居多，因此设施完备，缆车、索道、滑道一应俱全，在景区内还有汉堡王、subway等新快餐店，还有巨大的地下停车场，游览体验远超一般的5A级景区。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.山东枣庄台儿庄\n正如提起西安，便引人浮想联翩起周秦汉唐的钟鼎辉煌，台儿庄见证的是一个伟大民族不惧外侮坚贞无畏的抗争。国军将士积骨成山，积血成渊的那场大捷打破日无不胜的神话，在波澜壮阔的历史画卷中贡献了气壮山河浓墨重彩的一笔。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n奥古斯都\n点击下载\n73 个回答，查看全部。\n秋天适合去哪些地方旅游？\n秋天最适宜去哪里旅游？",

          "description": "本文分析基于Android S (12)\n前言\n汇编、C和C++本质上都是内存不安全的语言，因此开发者的无心之过可能会导致非法访问、内存踩踏等多种问题。这些内存问题一方面会影响用户的使用体验（进程崩溃、系统重启等）；另一方面也会被黑客利用，增加入侵的机会。所以内存问题不仅是稳定性的问题，也是安全性的问题。当然，如果考虑到后期安全补丁带来的升级影响，它或许也能算得上是一个经济问题。\nAndroid的native世界基本由C++语言构成（也包含少量的C、汇编和S上引入的Rust），其代码量甚至占到了平台总代码量的70%。因此，Google在这些年里研发了各种工具，目的就是为了高效地发现和解决各种内存问题。从最早期采用开源世界里的Valgrind工具，到Android N(7)上自主研发的Address Sanitizer(ASan)，Android Q(10)上引入的Hardware Address Sanitizer(HWASan)，和最新Android S(12)上引入的ARM Memory Tagging Extension(MTE)。\n\nASan和HWASan由Google自主开发，MTE由Google和ARM联合开发。尽管这三种工具的内部实现各有不同，但它们底层的思想其实是一致的。简而言之，这些工具的工作过程只有两步：\n在内存分配时为它生成一个独特的tag(标签)。\n在内存访问时去检测tag是否合规。\n在这个框架的基础上，每个工具的具体实现其实都在回答下述三个问题：\ntag如何生成？\ntag如何存储？\ntag是否合规的判据是什么？\n我们以ASan为例，回答上述三个问题。\ntag由单字节表示，可以反映8个真实内存字节的状态。生成时根据该块内存的实际状态选取tag值，因此tag值具有事先规定的含义。0x00表示8个字节均可访问，0x01表示8个字节中只有第一个字节可以访问…",
