          "description": "付费订阅服务是一个时不时就会引起热议的话题。去年底，国内外就分别出现过两次付费订阅相关的讨论。\n国内，爱奇艺在 2021 年 12 月 15 日进行了全方面的提价，他们认为「视频平台的会员订阅价格一直偏低，这一现象已影响到了行业的健康发展」了；国外，网红笔记软件 Notability 从「买断制」转成订阅制，在引起广泛不满后道歉，并宣布老用户无需订阅亦可使用已购功能。\n在涉及订阅制和付费的讨论中，一种常见论述是「国外用户付费意愿高，服务定价也高；国内用户付费意愿低，服务定价也低」。这种说法在多大程度上是准确的呢？下面我们分别来讨论。\n国外用户付费意愿一定更高吗？\n在我看来，如今国内网友们付费的意愿并不低；虽然有些应用突然改成订阅很难受，但开发者要生存大家也能理解，对于质量好的也越发愿意付费支持。此类事件中，更让大家觉得懊恼的，是厂商并没有给付费用户提供更好的、符合预期的产品，例如应用对已解锁功能重复收费、视频平台展示所谓「会员专属广告」等。\n当然，准确的观察还是要通过数据来得出。\n2021 年，美国一家咨询公司 West Monroe 对 2500 名美国用户开展了调查，并于八月发布了一份题为《订阅服务开支现状》（The State of Subscription Services Spending）的报告。报告显示，2021 年美国消费者人均订阅服务开支为每月 273 美元，比疫情前 2018 年的 237 美元提高了 15%。这相当于每年多花了 430 美元，折合人民币近 3000 元。\n\n需要指出，West Monroe 报告中的「订阅服务」包括了网费、手机话费等，这些服务在美国的价格非常高昂，而且也不属于本文想讨论的「订阅服务」范畴。将这两项（合计 150 美元）除去后，剩下的实际平均开支应为每人每月 123 美元。\n那我们国内的情况怎么样呢？由于找不到比较系统的研…",

          "description": "作为独立开发者 + 业余吉他手，很早前就想开发一款练习歌曲的工具。因为在练习歌曲时，经常需要针对某一个片段播放上百上千次，有时候需要变调（演奏跟原调不一样）、变速等…… \n这些场景在使用 QQ 音乐之类的播放器时，就显得略为不便，找了一圈也没发现特别趁手的工具。得益于技术的进步，特别是音轨分离的技术（有兴趣可以参考 Splitter.ai）的成熟，感觉针对于「如何更高效地学习歌曲」这个课题，我们可以做出一些更 Cool 更好玩有用的东西。\n这就有了我们最近发布的一款音乐工具产品：AudioJam。\n功能介绍\n使用 AI 技术，AudioJam 能从任意的歌曲中，提取出人声、鼓、贝斯、钢琴或键盘、吉他以及其他的音轨，并可以调整音量 Remix。这个技术在扒谱或者跟歌练习的时候特别有用。\n为了表现它惊艳的分离效果，我制作了一个简单的视频：\n \n分离了音轨之后，在电脑端你甚至可以通过重新安排不同乐器的位置，重新混响音乐，模拟更真实的效果。\n\n设置并保存循环之后，就可以不断重复该循环，用于片段的练习。\n\n如果是常用软件，每个细节都是很重要的，因为如果不好用，那每次使用都会给自己添堵。所以在 AudioJam 中，与传统播放器只能通过拖动进度条来定位不同，你还可以拖动波形图，做到精准地控制播放的位置。AudioJam 还支持直接长按波形图由该位置开始慢速预览，这在扒取一些快速音符的时候很有用。\n通过降速功能则可以有效地降低学习难度，也可以通过升降调，找到最适合自己演奏的曲调。\n\n「音乐附件」是我自己很喜欢的一个功能，可以在音乐项目中。创建便签来记录扒谱的结果、需要注意的地方，也可以导入现有的曲谱，当前附件支持预览 Guitar Pro 的曲谱。将歌曲的学习项目化。\n\n我个人觉得对于歌曲学习来说，移动应用并非最好用的工具，在歌曲学习这件事情上，我还是比较喜欢桌面应用，可以更精准地控制跟快速地输入，因此 AudioJam 支持了 iOS、Android、macOS、Windows 4 个平台。\n\n自动扒谱？\n很多朋友，在试用了 AudioJam 之后都给我提出了一个想法，它能不能做到自动扒谱呢？这个课题我个人的看法是这样的：\n我个人不太认可自动扒谱这件事情，因为音乐学习，不应该以变成「人肉读谱机」为目标。而是通过视听扒谱，去理解鉴赏这个音乐作品，而这个过程是就是不断提升自己音乐审美观以及听力的过程，不应该通过技术来偷懒。\n现在互联网的信息发达，大部分的歌曲都能找到别人精心编排好的乐谱，自动扒取的还无法达到这样的水平。不过我也可能会在未来添加上这样的功能。因为扒谱这件事对新手而言太不友好了，如果能自动扒谱的话，作为一个「参考答案」来辅助学习扒谱的话，可以让学习扒谱这件事变得更简单，学习曲线更平缓，也是一个「高效学习」的好功能。\n所以我们也有在调研一些相关的技术，如果有朋友对相关的音视频技术有研究的话，也欢迎跟我们一起探讨。\n\n如果你也有在玩一些乐器，比如吉他、鼓、钢琴或键盘之类的。AudioJam 绝对是一款对音乐学习很有帮助的产品。希望你可以自己下载来体验试试。\n最后，学无止境，与君共勉。希望大家能一直保持，对吉他和对音乐的热爱。\n \n> 下载少数派 客户端 、关注 少数派公众号 ，发现更多实用 App 📱\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "如今，Apple 全系的 Mac 产品都已经跨入了高分辨率屏幕，最新款的 MacBook Pro 甚至还采用了 mini-LED 技术和 ProMotion 自适应刷新率，为我们带来了笔记本上「天花板级别」一般的显示体验。\n但和 Mac 上高水准的屏幕不同的是，不少人还在用 2K 甚至 1080P 级别的屏幕，忍受着大果粒和小字体带来的麻烦。尽管 Mac 上也有屏幕分辨率调整的选项，但与 Windows 不同的是，Mac 官方仅支持 4K 分辨率以上的屏幕缩放，而 Windows 不仅可以支持各种显示器，还可以自定义缩放的倍数。这也而就意味着，1080P 和 2K 分辨率的显示器，在 Mac 上是无法进行原生的 HiDPI 缩放的，想要实现原生系统级的 HiDPI 支持，最低的条件必须是 4K 显示器。\n\n关于 HiDPI 是什么，这里不再展开介绍，感兴趣的朋友可以在其他地方学习。这里只提一点：即这套 HiDPI 逻辑和早年 Apple 在 Retina 视网膜显示屏开发时有着密不可分的关系。最早的 iPhone 4 实现视网膜显示屏的方式，就是将前代 iPhone 3GS 的 480×320 像素乘以 2，翻倍到了 960×640，并用四个像素渲染一个像素，实现了逻辑分辨率的一致。\n在后来，Apple 一些非视网膜屏幕的产品在升级视网膜屏幕后，也依旧沿用了这个逻辑。例如老款的 MacBook Pro 从 1280×800 升级到视网膜屏幕之后的物理分辨率就变成了 2560×1600，经过 2 倍 HiDPI 缩放之后就和原来的 MacBook Pro 的逻辑分辨率一致了。\n\n在 Intel 时代，我们可以通过一些脚本来实现在 2K 屏幕上的 HiDPI 缩放，以获得更加清晰锐利的显示效果。然而到了 Apple 芯片的 Mac 上，这个方法却失效了。如果想要开启系统的 Hi…",

          "description": "这个题目分为两个方面：\n一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；\n二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。\n1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？\n1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的\n将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。\n最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。\n1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度\n将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。\n如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。\n这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。\n只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。\n下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。\n\n1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果\n至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。\n\n\n\n2.什么样的是好发动机\n热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。\n低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。\n低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。\n高可靠性无需多言。\n两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n广龙先生\n点击下载\n58 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么发动机上最大扭矩不能转化为轮上最大扭矩?\n为什么丰田的2.0发动机有两种功率?",

Zynga Poker 是比较稳定流水的产品，这块没太大风险\n2. 休闲品类的能力，可以结合 2K 一些 IP 来做轻度一点的品类，开发周期比较短，靠 IP 加买量也能来一波钱，风险也比较可控\n3. 中重度，应该是看到了收购的工作室 Natural Motions 做的跨端 (移动端 + NS) 4v4 TPS 的 Star Wars: Hunters 品质还比较符合预期，至少能力上是证明了，可以逐步把一些 IP 迁移过去搞中重度收购\n4. 内置的广告系统，手游相互导量，抵消买量的成本\n5. 权益，包括星战和哈利波特 IP 游戏开发权\n\n\n一些想法\n\n马后炮来说，最好当然是过去几年 T2 逐渐收一些手游厂，像 EA 收购 Industrial Toys 或者是自建，比如 Activision Mobile……现在要迅速拉起一块上规模的手游业务，只能收购一些比较成熟的公司\nT2 有点着急了，几款 2K 体育游戏比较稳，但没有可观增量，IP 授权也要给出去一大笔钱；GTA6 还有好几年，别的 IP 比如四海兄弟、江湖本色这些都老化明显，续作比较无力，无主之地的 Gearbox 被 Embracer 卖掉又多了一些未知之数 (虽然 HD 端发行权还是 2K)\n如果能买个国内中型厂是个比较划算的选择，但世界并不是平的\n\n\nMarc\n点击下载\n24 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么R星做游戏这么牛啊？\n真的不懂，R星的游戏到底好玩在哪里？",

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n进入12月后，勇士队遭遇了一波进攻寒潮。11月，他们还能打出114.8分的百回合得分，而到了12月就只剩下了110.5分，在1月的三场比赛中更是低到了107.4分。相应地，球队核心库里也“难辞其咎”，个人百回合得分从11月的116.4分跌落到了12月的112.1、1月的110.2分，真实命中率更是从63.9%跌到了58.1%，1月份更是惨不忍睹的39.4%。\n对于造成勇士和库里如此下滑的原因，首先当然是库里个人的消耗问题。本赛季，库里在每回合之中、特别是进攻端的移动距离，比之17-18、18-19赛季，都有了一定的上涨。在曾经的勇士2.0时代，库里已经是一个拥有大量无球跑动、不断进行换位移动的进攻手，而本赛季的他则在本已不小的跑动量上进一步提高，来到了后卫中进攻跑动第九多的位置，且年过三十的年龄，也在加兰、科尔安东尼、德章泰穆雷等一众年轻人之中，显得格外突出。而在防守端，由于勇士一贯采取的集体换防策略，库里的跑动量自然也不会少，18-19赛季就有着后卫中第八多的防守移动，而本赛季也只是相对下降了0.07米。况且，我们还需要考虑到库里为了增强防守对位能力而采取的增重，对身体造成更大的负担。\n\n年龄的增加、体重的上升、移动的剧化，随着赛季的深入，这些问题逐渐开始影响库里，拉低了他的表现稳定性。这是每一个核心球星都必然面对的生涯阶段，出现波动，并不算非常离奇。而在此前的赛程中，勇士队也及时地找到了能为库里排忧解难、分担压力的替代者，乔丹普尔成为了球队的二号持球手，策动了相当比例的挡拆回合，也成为了比威少之于詹姆斯来得性价比远高的解压存在。\n然而，这样的良好趋势，却在12月开始，特别是到了1月份的几场比赛，开始出现了裂痕。对此，我们可以从阵容搭配中的变量来做初步把握。球队进攻最为气势如虹的11月，乔丹普尔场均拥有31.5分钟的出场时间，14.7次出手，…",

          "description": "众所周知，MOBA游戏网络效应好、社区属性强，自然增长极快。然而其初期推广难、用户累积慢、运营成本高等问题又总是令让众多厂商纷纷折戟。到今天，纵观市场，似乎只有《王者荣耀》和《无尽对决》曾杀出重围，获得人气与价值的双丰收。其他产品却没有这样好的运气了，不管是网易的《决战！平安京》，还是腾讯的《Arena of Valor》，纵使承载着极高期望和投入，却都没能够翻起太大水花，最终也不过是淹没于茫茫游戏之海，被众人所遗忘。\n\n2020年6月，腾讯和Pokemon Company共同宣布联手打造基于宝可梦IP的轻度MOBA手游《宝可梦大集结》，欲二度冲击海外市场。游戏于2021年7月登录Switch平台，同年9月登录移动端平台。令人惊讶的是，本作并没有照搬腾讯天美信手拈来的Dota式核心战斗模式，而是迎合轻度玩家喜好，从诸如《风暴英雄》和《Splatoon 2》的类MOBA游戏中汲取灵感，将游戏的重心，从杀敌推塔，转移到了收集能量、达阵得分上，让MOBA游戏走上了休闲娱乐的全新道路。腾讯希望依赖宝可梦的全球影响力来吸引到IP粉丝/泛用户，逐步扩圈，培养出更大的欧美MOBA玩家市场。那么，此番采用全新玩法与独特画风、针对不同目标用户群的《宝可梦大集结》，有没有帮助腾讯再下一城呢？\n\n从数据来看，上线三个月的《宝可梦大集结》在海外市场的表现可谓是高开低走。在声势浩大的首周发布后，游戏逐步暴露出新用户获取乏力、现有用户流失多、长期付费不如意等问题。这究竟是什么原因呢？本期《庖丁解游》就将为大家解析一下这款游戏：《宝可梦大集结》。\n\n\n（一）游戏循环：单局对战贯穿始终\n\n《宝可梦大集结》游戏核心循环示意如图，MOBA类游戏的核心循环简单明了，主要以单局对战为基础，在对战—变强—继续对战的链条上衍生诸多其他机制。对《宝可梦大集结》来说，在对战之外，玩家还可以在对战中累计胜场、获得金币，从而…",

          "description": "机器学习方案将帮助不同的无线电协议，如 Wi-Fi 和 LTE，在同一的无线频谱中更有效地协同工作。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）开发的机器学习方案有可能显著改善 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率的方式。研究人员声称，与试错法相比，NIST 的方案可以使共享通信频率的过程的效率提高多达 5000 倍。\n\r\nNIST 系统的理念是，无线电设备可以从经验中学习其网络环境，而不是像现在这样，简单地根据试错法选择频率信道。\n\r\nNIST 在 其网站上的一篇文章 中说，在特定的环境条件下，“该算法可以学习哪个信道提供最好的结果”。\n\r\n该团队说:“该方案可以被编程到现实世界中许多 [不同] 类型网络的发射机软件中。”\n\r\n从本质上讲，这个计算机模拟的算法是一个映射环境射频条件的先前经验的公式。例如，这些条件可以包括在一个信道（一组相邻的频率）内运行的发射机的数量。\n\r\n文章说：“……如果发射机选择了一个未被占用的信道，那么成功传输的概率就会上升，从而导致更高的数据速率。”同样地，当发射机选择一个没有太多干扰的信道时，信号会更强，你也会得到更好的数据速率。发射机会记住哪个信道提供了最佳结果，并学会在下次需要清晰信号时学会选择那个位置。\n\r\n这与今天的工作方式不同。也就是说，无线电只是试图找到一个开放频率，然后与类似协议的无线电进行通信。在复杂的情况下，使用诸如 Wi-Fi、跳频和 波束成形 等技术来优化信道。\n\r\n研究人员解释说，NIST 的机器学习技术的亮点在于共享频谱，比如通过授权频谱辅助接入（LAA）共享 Wi-Fi。LAA 是非授权频谱中的 LTE 频谱，称为 LTE-U，频率为 5GHz。在相同频率下的 Wi-Fi 与 LAA 的组合中，协议是不同的：无线电之间不能相互通信以协调工作，而且频带越繁忙就可能出现混乱 —— 传输会遇到其他传输。但是，如果所有的无线电接收机都能更好地选择它们的占位，通过学习哪些有效，哪些无效，那么这将会更好。\n\r\nNIST 工程师 Jason Coder 在文章中说：“这可能会使非授权频段的通信更加高效。”\n\r\n事实上，NIST 声称，它“可以帮助 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率，其效率大约是试错法的 5000 倍。”\n\r\n这里的关键词是“共享”，因为为了在有限的频谱内增加通信，必须进行更多的共享 —— 物联网或媒体流等用户都在争夺同样的隐喻资产。随着物联网和数字技术的不断发展，非授权和授权频段的结合，就像 LAA 中的情况一样，可能会变得更加普遍。（非授权的频段是指那些没有分配给特定用户的频段，比如移动网络运营商；授权频段是在拍卖中中标并分配的。）\n\r\n在 NIST 场景中，相互竞争的发射机“各自学习在不相互通信的情况下最大化网络数据速率”。因此，多种协议和数据类型，如视频或传感器数据，或 Wi-Fi 和移动网络，可以相互协作。\n\r\nNIST 的方案大大简化了为发射机分配最佳信道的过程，根据这篇文章研究发现，穷尽努力 [使用试错法] 来确定最佳解决方案需要大约 45600 次试验，而这个方案只需要尝试 10 个渠道就可以选择类似的解决方案，仅仅付出 0.02% 的努力。”\n\r\nNIST 的研究人员在 IEEE 第 91 届车辆技术会议上展示了他们的研究成果。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3561618/nist-aims-to-make-frequency-sharing-more-efficient-for-wireless-networks.html\n\r\n作者：Patrick Nelson 选题：lujun9972 译者：CN-QUAN 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "我知道对于圣诞愿望清单来说已经太晚了，但我仍然想分享我希望在 GNOME 中看到的东西。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME 是许多 Linux 发行版的默认桌面环境。它也是我最喜欢的一个，因为它提供了一种现代的桌面体验。\n\r\n但这并不意味着 GNOME 是完美的，不需要改进。事实上，这里有几个建议可以改善整个用户体验。\n\r\n1、方便的应用程序卸载选项\n\r\n桌面 Linux 是碎片化的。为了增加混乱，连软件包也是零零散散的。而最糟糕的是当你从系统中删除一个应用程序时。\n\r\n举个例子，你要通过 DEB 包安装一个应用程序，并使用 GNOME 软件中心界面来安装它。\n\r\n但如果你不喜欢这个应用程序，想把它删除呢？\n\r\n你不会在软件中心中找到该应用程序。相反，你得必须使用命令行的方法。\n\r\n这还没完。还有 Snap 和 Flatpak 软件包。如果你已经使用了其中之一，你必须先找出来，然后使用正确的命令才行。\n\r\nGNOME 采用了类似于 Android/iOS 的方法，将应用程序显示在一个网格中，并将它们组织在文件夹中。移动操作系统为用户提供了一种方式，即按住图标并删除应用程序。如果能有一个类似的选项，右键点击应用程序图标并选择卸载，那就更好了。\n\r\n\n\r\n这样，终端用户就不用管所安装的应用程序是 Deb 包还是 Snap 包。没有必要为此进入终端，而且它就发生在访问应用程序地方，这不是挺好吗？\n\r\nLinux Mint Cinnamon 版有这样的功能，你在菜单中右键点击一个应用程序条目，选择删除它。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果 Cinnamon 能做到，GNOME 应该也能做到，对吗？\n\r\n2、在应用程序商店中设置默认软件源\n\r\n如果一个应用程序有多种格式，GNOME 软件中心可以让你选择软件源。至少这是我在 Fedora 的 GNOME 软件中看到的，但在 Ubuntu 中没有。\n\r\n\n\r\n假…",

          "description": "开源开发者自毁其广泛使用的依赖库\n\r\n开源库 colors.js 和 faker.js 被广泛使用。在 NPM 上，colors.js 的周下载量超过 2000 万次，有近 19000 个项目依赖它。前几天，它的开发者在这些库的最新版本中加入了无限循环和乱码，依赖它的项目会在控制台看到不停打印的非 ASCII 字符。他将这两个库的 自毁版本 推送到了 GitHub 和 NPM，因而导致多个使用这些依赖库的软件出现故障，其中包括亚马逊的 AWS CDK。这位开发者似乎是因为没有得到使用他的开源软件的大公司的 付费，而专门做了这种破坏。这件事引来了业界和社区的激烈讨论。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我认为，你可以因没有得到报酬而放弃项目，但是这不是你蓄意报复的理由。如果一开始就想着获益，请发布你的商业版本。这种最初遵循开源许可证和开源文化的开源软件，在邀名不成、获利不得后恼羞成怒地大肆破坏，或许没有违反许可证和法律，但是却给整个开源文化泼了一盆脏水。我对这种行为持反对意见。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMozilla 基金会其实从 2014 年就开始接受加密货币捐款\n\r\n之前我们报道过，Mozilla 基金会官方 Twitter 账号在 1 月 1 日提醒粉丝它接受加密货币，如比特币、以太坊的捐款，但这一声明招致了 猛烈批评，最终迫使 Mozilla 基金会宣布 暂停 接受加密货币捐款。但实际上 Mozilla 基金会从 2014 年就开始 接受加密货币捐款，当时 Mozilla 还列举了其它接受加密货币捐款的组织，如可汗学院、电子前沿基金会、绿色和平组织和维基媒体基金会。到今天，只有绿色和平组织停止接受加密货币捐款。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：加密货币是否该死，我觉得不能用政治正确来评判。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWindows 11 上仍能使用软驱和软盘\n\r\n去年发布的 Windows 11 系统，调整了硬件安装需求，很多硬件都不再支持，需要使用较新的 CPU 和 TPM 2.0 等等。但是，有用户发现，Windows 11 上居然还可以成功使用索尼 5.25 寸软盘。这意味着，Windows 11 对外部设备还保留了不错的兼容性。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 5.25 寸、3.5 寸软盘已经基本退出历史舞台，可在特定领域依然有用武之地，但这个反差让我有些吃惊。",

          "description": "有 几个可用于 Linux 的截图工具，我喜欢 使用 Flameshot 进行截图 和 Shutter 来编辑现有的截图。\n\r\n但不幸的是，Flameshot 不能在 4K 屏幕上工作。因此，我不得不使用默认的 GNOME 截图工具，它在我的带有超高清屏幕的戴尔 XPS 上工作得非常好。\n\r\n\n\r\n这一“被迫之举”让我意识到，如果你知道如何正确使用，GNOME 截图 并不是一个糟糕的工具。\n\r\n在这里，我指的是用键盘快捷键来使用它，因为这样可以节省大量的时间。\n\r\n让我展示一下如何像专家一样用那些方便的键盘快捷键来使用 GNOME 截图应用。\n\r\n我假定你没有改变这里的默认的截图的键盘快捷键。\n\r\n对整个屏幕进行截图：使用 Prt Scr 键\n\r\n这是最简单的操作。在你的键盘上找到 Prt Sc（或称 Prt Scr、Prt Scn）键并按下它。它将对整个屏幕进行截图，并将其保存在你的主目录下的图片文件夹中。\n\r\n\n\r\n在某些发行版（或版本）中，你可能会看到是否要保存截图的选项，但大多数情况下，它会自动保存屏幕截图。\n\r\n这里需要注意的另一件事是，如果你有多个屏幕连接到系统上，它会把所有的屏幕一起截图。这意味着，你会得到一个超宽的图像。\n\r\n但是，如果你只想对某个应用进行截图，而不是对整个屏幕进行截图呢？\n\r\n给一个应用程序的窗口截图：使用 Alt+Prt Scr 键\n\r\n要给正在运行的图形应用截图，你需要这样做：\n\r\n点击正在运行的应用，使其获得焦点。现在，按住 Alt 键并按 Prt Scr 键。\n\r\n它将得到应用窗口的截图，并保存到图片目录中。\n\r\n\n\r\n这样获取的截图也有一个阴影效果，看起来很不错。\n\r\n这很好，但如果你只想给某个特定区域截图，而不是整个屏幕呢？这也有一个技巧。\n\r\n对屏幕的选定区域进行截图：使用 Shift+Prt Scr 键\n\r\n按住 Shift 键。然后按 Prt Scr 键。你会看到屏幕上出现一个选框。将鼠标移动到所需的区域，开始拖动光标。它将高亮显示该区域，并在你释放鼠标后立即进行截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n复制截图到剪贴板而不是保存它们\n\r\n当你在和别人聊天时，要和对方分享屏幕截图时，这非常有用。\n\r\n\n\r\n首先截图，但没必要将保存的截图文件附在聊天工具中。相反，你可以直接将截图复制到剪贴板，然后使用 Ctrl+V 快捷键将图像（从剪贴板）粘贴到聊天工具。\n\r\n这样，你的系统就不会保留不必要的截图，你也可以节省一些鼠标点击次数。\n\r\n要把截图保存到剪贴板，以便你能把它们粘贴到聊天工具、绘图工具或文档中，你必须把 Ctrl 键和你在前面几节中看到的其他截图快捷键一起使用。\n\r\n\r\nCtrl+Prt Scr：将整个屏幕的截图复制到剪贴板上。\n\r\nCtrl+Alt+Prt Scr：将应用窗口的截图复制到剪贴板上。\n\r\nCtrl+Shift+Prt Scr：将选定区域的截图复制到剪贴板上\n\r\n\r\n我必须补充一点，在这种情况下，使用像 Flameshot 这样的工具 甚至更好一些，因为它允许你在将截图保存到剪贴板之前对其进行注释。这样，你可以很容易地高亮屏幕的重要部分。\n\r\n在截图中添加延迟，以便对下拉菜单进行截图\n\r\n到目前为止，一切都很好。你只需按下几个键，就可以随心所欲地进行截图了。\n\r\n问题是，当你要对下拉菜单或右键动作等进行截图时。当你按下屏幕截图键时，想要的项目可能会消失。\n\r\n为了处理这种情况，你可以对该区域或整个屏幕进行截图，但要有一个延迟。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 GNOME 屏幕截图工具中，你可以选择添加这个延迟。例如，你添加了 6 秒的延迟。你点击截图按钮，有 6 秒时间来做/显示你想做的事情。6 秒后，它就会自动截图了。\n\r\n你有什么技巧吗？\n\r\n这就是我使用 GNOME 截图工具的所有技巧。如果你还没有广泛地使用它，你应该会发现它很有帮助。如果你已经是一个专家，也许你知道一些可以添加到本文中的东西？请在评论区与我们其他人分享吧。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/using-gnome-screenshot-tool/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "在使用飞书以前，我是如何网络授课的\n2020年一月，一场疫情将人类社会冻结。工作冻结、生活冻结。人们被关在家里没法出门，也不能参与到工作当中。也正是因为这样，催生出了「远程办公」这样的模式，让一直不被大家重视的「协同办公」走到了历史的舞台最前方，展现出了不一样的魅力。\n传统的协同办公，自然要提到 Google Workspace 这个远程协同办公的老大哥。在日本的公司里，经常需要讨论教案或者上课的一些新方法，有些时候需要整理成文档。公司有订阅 Workspace ，所以我们都在其上面讨论或者通过文档来交流对于教案的看法。\n同样因为疫情受到影响的，还有我们上课的流程。以往都是线下面授课，疫情期间全部改为用 Zoom 给学生上网课，这个时候就涉及到了板书问题。线下可以写在白板上，线上怎么办呢？在使用飞书以前，我的解决办法是用 iPad 加入会议，然后再用 iPad 来共享屏幕进行板书。这样确实很方便，却也存在一个不可调和的问题——画面同步差到极致。往往一个流畅的书写过程被卡顿的屏幕共享硬生生切成了三个分解动作；往后流畅地翻页被其分解成了 PPT 没有过度特效的翻页。\n总之，一切的一切，都迫使我停止使用 iPad 来作为板书工具，并且急需一个替代品。这个代替品既能起到「板书」的作用，同时还能兼顾 PDF 阅读器的职能。最好还能在 PDF 文件上做标记。\n开始尝试使用飞书\n需求有了，接下来就是对比市面上的产品了。学生年龄在初中阶段，用 Coda 或者 Worspace 不太合适，他们可能并没有太多精力去研究这两个东西到底怎么用；用 Notion 的话导入 PDF 又非常不便； iPad 更是不再考虑，它最多只能作为一个辅助性的工具。\n找到飞书是个巧合，完全是在研究工作流的时候碰到了飞书，并且被这个远程办公的模式启发，觉得可以用在我的课堂上。说干就干，于是我从本地将我目前保留的教案全…",

          "description": "CloudStorage: \n前言\n随着业务规模的不断扩大，企业越来越重视构建高性能、高可用的大型分布式系统。为了解决应用耦合，合理进行流量削锋，腾讯云提供了包括 CKafka 和 TDMQ 在内的一系列消息队列中间件。为了更方便地对消息队列中的数据进行转存和持久化，腾讯云对象存储 COS 为用户提供了云消息队列备份的能力。\n一、云消息队列备份方案-使用 COS 应用集成备份\nCOS 应用集成 是腾讯云对象存储 COS 基于 Serverless 云函数，为开发者提供的存储数据应用解决方案。开发者只需要在 COS 控制台一键配置，即可使用丰富的功能。\nCOS 应用集成提供了云消息队列备份的能力，开发者可以轻松配置定时备份任务，将云消息队列中的消息记录以文件的形式转至对象存储，以便进行持久化保存。开发者可以通过备份文件提取消息记录，对消息进行入库、统计分析等操作。\n\n二、方案优势\n存储成本低：对象存储支持数据归档和降冷，长期存储成本低；\n可视化操作：一键配置，简化开发流程，无需编码工作；\n指定范围：可指定消费的起始位置，排除不需要的记录；\n消息聚合：可按分钟维度聚合消息记录，并支持修改时间粒度；\n自动化执行：云函数自动完成云消息队列 CKafka / TDMQ 的数据备份，中间过程无需任何人工操作；\n三、云消息队列介绍\n**消息队列 **CKafka （ Cloud Kafka ）是一个分布式、高吞吐量、高可扩展性的消息系统，100%兼容开源 Kafka API 0.9.0 至 2.8.0 版本。CKafka 基于发布订阅模式，通过消息解耦，使生产者和消费者异步交互，无需彼此等待。CKafka 具有数据压缩、支持离线和实时数据处理等优点，适用于日志压缩收集、监控数据聚合等场景。\n**消息队列 TDMQ **（ Tencent Distributed Message Queue ）是腾讯基于 Apache Pulsar 自研的一个云原生消息中间件系列，其中包含兼容 Pulsar 、RabbitMQ 、RocketMQ 等协议的消息队列子产品，得益于其底层计算与存储分离的架构，TDMQ 具备良好的弹性伸缩以及故障恢复能力。\n四、备份任务设置步骤\n这里以设置 CKafka 消息备份任务为例，TDMQ 设置与之相似：\n登录腾讯云 对象存储 COS 控制台。\n在左侧导航中，单击 [应用集成] ，找到 [ CKafka 消息备份] 。\n单击 [配置备份规则] ，进入规则配置页面。\n单击 [添加函数] 。注意：如果您尚未开通云函数服务，请前往 云函数控制台 开通云函数服务，按照提示完成服务授权即可。\n在弹出的窗口中，配置如下信息：\n\na.函数名称：作为函数的唯一标识名称，创建后不可修改（您可以在云函数控制台上查看该函数）。\nb.关联存储桶：存放 CKafka 消息的 COS 存储桶。\nc.时间粒度：根据消息量的大小，选取汇聚消息的时间间隔，时间间隔为 5 - 15 分钟不等。为保证转存性能，聚合文件数量与 Partition 数量、partition_max 设置数值有关。有关 Partition 的说明，请参见分区。\nd.SCF 授权：CKafka 消息备份需要授权云函数从您的 CKafka 服务中读取相关实例消息，并将消息转存至您指定的存储桶中。因此需要添加此授权。\n6.单击 [下一步] ，进行 CKafka 配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.实例选择：选择消息来源的 CKafka 实例，仅支持同地域的 CKafka 实例。\nb.主题选择：选择消息来源的主题。\nc.起始位置：消息转储备份时历史消息的处理方式，topic offset 设置。\nd.访问地址：必须为 VPC 内网访问地址，基础网络的 CKafka 实例请添加路由策略，具体请参考 添加路由策略。注意：对应的 VPC 子网中必须有可用的 IP ，且必须支持 DHCP 。\n7.单击 [下一步] ，进行投递配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.投递的路径：备份文件的投递路径前缀，不填写则默认保存在存储桶根路径，指定前缀必须以斜杠 “ / ” 为结尾。\n8.添加配置后，单击 [确认] ，即可看到函数已添加完成。\n\n五、查看备份文件\n等待一段时间后，可以看到存储桶下投递了备份文件，其内容的每行代表一条消息记录。\n\n\n\n好了，本期关于云备份方案将分享到这里，欢迎点击“链接”，查看更多云消息队列备份攻略。",

          "description": "theme: github\n背景是这样的，\n我们对外提供了一个 sdk，收到客户的反馈，说他们监控平台监测到 sdk 内部的一个接口 A 经常有耗时，最多能达到 10 几秒。\n可从我们自己的平台看，接口 A 的耗时是正常范围的，而且使用的网络库 timeout = 8s，不太可能出现耗时 10 几秒的问题。\n由于客户也没有稳定的复现场景，也不排除是对方统计工具的问题，就卡住了。\n进展，\n重新回到代码中，经过又一番的代码走查，注意到了该接口有使用 AsyncTask ，点进 AsyncTask 源码一看，突然有种玄学变科学的感觉：\n    private static final int CORE_POOL_SIZE = 1;\n    private static final int MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE = 20;\n    private static final int KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS = 3;\n    public static final Executor THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR;\n    ...\n\n    static {\n        ThreadPoolExecutor threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(\n                CORE_POOL_SIZE, MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE, KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS,\n                new SynchronousQueue(), sThreadFactory);\n        threadPoolExecutor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(sRunOnSerialPolicy);\n        THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR = threadPoolExecutor;\n    }\n\n了解线程池的应该都知道，\nCORE_POOL_SIZE : 核心线程数。核心线程只有在 allowCoreThreadTimeOut = true 时，才会被回收，否则不会被回收掉的，即使没有任务执行，也会保持空闲状态。\nMAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE : 线程池最大允许创建的线程数。当线程数量达到 corePoolSize， 且 workQueue 队列塞满后，才会继续创建线程；当创建的线程达到 MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE 时，新来的任务会执行拒绝策略。\nKEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS : 表示非核心线程在没有任务执行时，最多能保持多少时间会被回收。\nSynchronousQueue\n直接在网上找了一段容易理解的定义：\n“ SynchronousQueue 是一个不存储元素的阻塞队列，消费者线程调用 take() 方法的时候就会发生阻塞，直到有一个生产者线程生产了一个元素，消费者线程就可以拿到这个元素并返回；生产者线程调用put()方法的时候就会发生阻塞，直到有一个消费者线程消费了一个元素，生产者才会返回。”\n结论\n由于 CORE_POOL_SIZE = 1, 且阻塞队列为 SynchronousQueue，所以 AsyncTask 执行的任务为串行执行。而其 THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR 线程池又是静态的，所以不同 AsyncTask 对象会共用该线程池。所以我们应当避免使用 AsyncTask，尤其是在 sdk 开发中。\n经过全局查找，发现项目内还有一个鉴权接口 B 也使用了 AsyncTask，所以该事故原因为，在网络环境较差时，接口 B 请求服务，会阻塞接口 A 请求, 导致客户统计耗时增加，最大耗时 2 * timeout。\n方案\n规范代码，使用统一的线程池。ThreadPoolSchedulers 就不细贴了，就是创建了一个 Executor\n    asyncTask.executeOnExecutor(ThreadPoolSchedulers.io());\n\n文章完。",
