          "description": "Time estimation in software engineering seems to be the most difficult task.\nTime estimation becomes a bit easier for well-managed projects where most of the design decisions have been made and there is enough internal tooling and resources. But it is still not perfect. Things become more difficult for teams with limited resources and external pressure on deadlines. More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.\nWhen it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge. It becomes worse if there is no external motivation or revenue potential for the project. Building something for fun or learning might end up in an unfinished project that never sees a launch day.\nSide projects should be straightforward by design…",

          "description": "what should I know before learning Java\n\n\nWell, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)\n\nI am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. \nIf you are a beginner, please don't use any kind of IDE.\n IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. \nIt is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. \nAs using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. \nSo you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. \nThis learning method is slow but very effective. \nAlthough you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. \nYou can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.💯",

It also highlights the line with different colors to help you better visualize and differentiate between errors, warnings and other messages!\n\nWith this extension, you can search for relevant CSS files by using CSS classes in html file and edit CSS files there itself! Here's how it works:\n\nGitLens is a powerful extension which can display when a particular line was committed, by whom it was committed and in which pull request it was included along with the commit message! All of this information is inline with the line upon which your cursor is currently located.\nYou can also hover over the message to get even more information about a particular line of code!\n\n\nThere are many more features in GitLens which you can explore and play around with!\nImport Cost allows us to see the size of the imported package inline in the editor itself!\n\nVersion Lens fetches information about dependency versions and displays it on top of the package!\n\nThese were the 5 VSCode extensions which are powerful, useful and can improve your productivity and workflow!\nSigning off.\nTwitter | GitHub | LinkedIn",
