          "description": "很多人希望通过一些考试来改变自己的现状，或者提升自己，例如研究生入学考试、公务员考试、技能证书考试等等。\n而离开高中校园之后，几乎就没有人来帮助监督我们学习，也有很多别的事情会影响到学习进程，于是很多人会选择全职备考。可能是大学毕业后 gap 一年，也可能是辞去工作，希望通过全职备考、专心复习以达到更好的复习效果和考试成绩。\n但全职备考并非适合所有人，也不是一时脑热就决定的。这篇文章中，我们就来讨论下全职备考的利与弊，希望可以帮助大家做出适合自己的决定。\n\n为什么要全职备考？\n考试竞争激烈\n不可否认有些朋友会选择在考试前突击，因为有些考试达到及格线，或者过了分数线就可以通过，也不会有什么成绩排名，突击一下就可以达到满意的结果。这虽然不是什么万全之策，但却是花费时间和精力较少的一种做法。\n然而，包括研究生入学考试、公务员考试在内的大型考试，在考前并没有既定的分数线或者合格线，是在考试过后进行排名，根据排名来划定分数线。分数线取决于这次考试的考题难度和所有考生的成绩和。因此，可能去年的分数线与今年的分数线差距很大，往年的分数线不具备参考价值，也没法根据此来设定自己的复习目标。所以这就需要备考的大家掌握大量的知识点，以求拿到更多的分数和更高的排名。\n管理学研究生入学考试国家线变化趋势（来源：研招网）\n这些大型考试的竞争非常激烈，在 2021 年国家研究生入学考试报名人数就达到了 377 万人，部分院校报名人数甚至超过了 1 万人。但是考试录取的名额并没有明显增加，甚至有些还会降低。这就意味着，这些大型考试的成绩越高越好，排名越靠前越好，不能只求过线。所以这些复习就不能只掌握部分知识点，复习地越细节越好。全职备考可以保证足够的复习时间和精力，进而在激烈竞争中胜出，这就是很多人选择全职备考的原因。\n全职备考复习时间更充裕\n如果你有强大自制力和自控力，能够坚持在空闲时间进行复习，那么也…",

          "description": "Apple Watch Series 7 是近年变化最大的一代 Apple Watch，也是变化没那么大的一代。变化之大在于，Apple Watch Series 7 是继 Apple Watch Series 4 之后设计改动最大的一代：屏幕更大、边框更窄，还有全新配色的表壳；说它变化不大，是因为相比老款，这代产品几乎没有新的硬件与配套功能。\n颜色方面，不锈钢和钛金属版本的表款与之前相比没有什么变化，铝金属表款的配色则有了全新的 5 种选项，分别为午夜色、星光色、绿色、新款蓝色和红色，部分配色与 iPhone 13 以及新款 iPad mini 类似。\n\n比如午夜色表壳，仔细观察会有一种极深的蓝色的质感，绿色表壳颜色偏深，不仔细看的话反而会有一种接近黑色的质感，也能比较好地融入日常搭配。\n左：午夜色表壳 | 右：绿色表壳绿色表壳\n星光色表壳则与 iPad mini 的星光色类似，相比之前的银色表款色彩的层次表现更加出色，不同光线之下可能会有金色或者粉色的呈现效果。\n星光色表壳\n蓝色和红色是经过重新设计的 2 款配色。其中蓝色相比之前的版本颜色更浅更亮，有种更加轻快活泼的感觉；新款的红色给人的感觉又会更加「深沉」。\n蓝色表壳红色表壳\n戴上 Apple Watch Series 7，这块「全面屏」带来的视觉冲击感受还是足够让人印象深刻：紧贴表壳边缘的(轮廓表盘) 时标刻度，加上因为光线反射带来的「曲面」显示效果，这块 Apple Watch 给人的第一印象可以用「惊艳」来形容。\n轮廓表盘\n没错，这块手表的显示屏幕依然是一块直屏，利用弧形表镜产生的光线反射现象，通过侧面观察，能够看到时标刻度浮在屏幕边缘，让人产生这是一块「曲面屏」的错觉。\n\n如果不是放在一起比较，我不太能感受得到 41 毫米的新表款相比 40 毫米的老表款大了多少，毕竟 Apple Watch Series 7 的高度和宽度仅比之前多了 1 毫米 (41 毫米表款)。不过，如果将 2 款产品放在一起，Apple Watch Series 7 的「全面屏」会给人一种手表「大了不少」的错觉。\nApple Watch Series 7 / SE / Series 3\n除了上面提到的 41 毫米表款，根据官网给出的规格参数，45 毫米版本表款的高度比老款多了 1 毫米，2 个尺寸的表款厚度均为 10.7 毫米，与前代产品没有差别。\n重量方面，铝金属、不锈钢、钛金属 3 种表壳表款的重量均比前代产品更重。其中，41 毫米版本的 3 种表款分别重了 1.5 克、2.6 克、2.4 克，45 毫米版本的 3 种表款分别重了 2.3 克、4.4 克、3.8 克。理论上看，新款 Apple Watch 的重量变化几乎可以忽略不计，也与我的佩戴感受相当；不过，对于手表重量的感知程度因人而异，在意重量不妨等到 10 月 15 日手表上市之后去店里戴戴看。\nApple Watch Series 7 配备的同样是一块 LTPO 全天候视网膜屏，亮度与前代产品一致可达 1000 尼特。不同的是在非抬手亮屏状态下，新款手表的显示亮度有了显著提升，表盘上的信息变得更好读了。根据官网介绍，非抬手亮屏状态的亮度最高提升了 70%。不过，目前来看，我对于息屏显示的亮度提升没有特别大的感知，需要更长时间的使用与体验，观察这项功能提升的实际效果。\n息屏显示状态\n性能方面，在 Apple Watch Series 7 上使用 App 反应同样十分灵敏，各种 App 的打开速度、交互反馈都很及时，但与 Apple Watch Series 6 相比，没有明显变化。\n有趣的是，根据官方数据，Apple Watch Series 7 搭载的是一枚 64 位双核 S7 芯片，速度最快比搭载 S5 芯片的 Apple Watch SE 快了 20%；而 S6 芯片的运行速度，根据此前给出的数据，同样比 S5 芯片最快提升了 20%，似乎间接证明了 S7 芯片在性能方面与 S6 芯片相比没有提升。\n结合 Apple Watch Series 7 具有更大的显示屏幕和更高的息屏显示亮度的特性，且续航时间相比前代产品没有变化，S7 芯片应该是专注于在能耗与功耗方面进行优化，以抵消这部分特性带来的额外功耗。\n由于拿到 Apple Watch Series 7 的时间很短，对于续航、充电速度以及新功能等方面的体验，我们还没能实现完整的测试和体验，也欢迎你通过 网站 / 客户端、公众号、微博 继续关注少数派，第一时间获取我们后续的完整体验内容。\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "极客时间四周年的时候搞了个活动，让作者们都写一点最近的思考，我想了想，就写了一些关于“眼界”的。这个话题其实我以前也有写到，但是随着阅历的增加，这个词正变得越来越重要。我写的那几段话是：\n“每个人都有自己不同的能力和特质，有的是先天具备的，比如有的人天生就记忆力出色；有的是后天努力的，比如通过坚持不懈的奋斗做成一件大事。可是，有的特质却既非先天可具备，又非后天可努力得到，在我们朴素的教育背景中，它们往往总被忽略。它们的其中一个，就是眼界。在投资领域，大概有这样一句话，把一个问题如果放到十年、二十年的维度上去看，问题就会简单很多。倒不是说要宣扬佛系心态，而是说，要有够大的眼界，能够‘忽略’掉那些纷纷扰扰的细枝末节，而专注于主要的因素。”\n\n\n\n\n\n“毕业工作以来，随着经验的积累，我的心态也在不断变化。在我刚踏入职场的时候，我对自己特别自信，我相信自己具备足够的天赋能够成功；几年之后，我觉得自己通过坚持和努力能够做到自己梦想的事情；而现在，我越来越觉得，眼界，似乎是它才能决定一个人长久职业发展的天花板。一些人能够做到足够大的事情，一个必不可少的原因是他们其实本来就已经站得够高，本来就见过很多世面，有了足够开阔的眼界，毕竟单靠天赋和努力，再怎样潜心奋斗，螺丝钉也不能成为决定整个机器运转的关键零件。”\n\n\n\n\n\n“而有意思的是，所谓眼界，是需要不断去新的领域和环境尝试、经历，才能慢慢开阔的，而一个人愿意去做出尝试的意愿，恰恰又是从很小时候就培育的心态所决定的，那是不是可以说，一个人的天花板在哪里，对于这样的问题，很可能从小、从成长环境，甚至从父母那里，就能找到这个答案呢？”\n\n\n\n\n我不知道你怎样想，在我的认知里，至少对于绝大多数人来说，我从来不相信一个人的未来是无限可能的，但是我却有无法说出，到底所谓的天花板，所谓的边界，到底是谁限定的。后来我慢慢感受到了，可能这个边界，就是每个人的父母、每个人的生活环境所限定的。\n简单来说，人活得越久，就越能看到自己父母的影子。我最近忽然发现，我的性格、我的长处，我的短处，我对问题的思考方法，我对于某些现状的不安和挣扎，甚至我在某些问题上的软弱和放弃，以及不够豁达的气度，都在我的父母身上找到了影子。\n我不知你有没有这样的想法，这确实有点让我感到灰心丧气。如果一个人的努力让自己成长，但是却在这个过程中慢慢看到了自己难以跳出的边界，这很难不对自己保持希望的心态有所打击。但人的成长可能就是这样的一个过程，每个人都一样，你不可能永远都是充满希望的潜质新人。\n稍稍思考一下原因，也许能找到一些合理的解释。比方说，如果从小父母身体力行，就都是对细节把握得扎实，做事认真严谨，甚至完美主义，那么很可能他们的孩子也具备了这样优秀的特质，但另一方面，也很有可能这样的人不容易拿得起放得下，无法豁达地生活。无论好坏，这样的特质可以说是深深地镌刻在性格里的，是真正决定一个人可能性上限的，是非常非常难以改变的。\n当然，话说回来，每个人都有自己与众不同的小倔强，这个倔强可能让自己在这边界所确定的大框架下，有一点自己小小的特立独行。兴许，每个人“应当”做的，就是尽力去认识清楚自己究竟是怎样一个人，然后才看看什么事、哪些事才是自己适合做的。\n那么，怎么才能够认识清楚自己呢？我觉得这就要回到一开始的那个关键词——“眼界”上面来了。这就好像当人只待在地球上的时候，是很难准确说出地球的形状的，只有到了太空，才能看到地球是球形的。眼界越开阔，就越能够认清自己。我觉得这是眼界给每个人自己带来的最大价值。",
