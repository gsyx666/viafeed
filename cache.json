We then create a new XMLHttpRequest object. We open the GET request and set the URL. We also set the true parameter, which ensures that the request is made asynchronously.\nWe then define two functions, onload and onerror . onload will be executed when the request is loaded, while onerror will be executed if there is an error. We then send the request.\nIf the request is successful, we will get the response body. We will then extract the data from the body and log it to the console. \nYou can try running the code in your browser. You should see the data for all the repositories on GitHub.\nThanks for reading ☺️\nPlease follow me on git here GitHub.com/yakumwamba",

It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. \nOne of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. \nSvelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient. If you are looking for a new JavaScript framework, Svelte is definitely worth considering. \nThanks for reading!\nKindly follow me for more topics on Svelte https://GitHub.com/yakumwamba\nTwitter.com/brianlemba",

He’s since spent countless hours researching, writing and talking about how companies can not only bring neurodiverse talent into the fold, but why engineering teams thrive when they do.\nIn this episode of Dev Interrupted we talk with Matt about best practices in recruiting, hiring and working with neurodiverse coders, how his interview at Google interview led to an autism diagnosis, the ways Matt’s data team at the University of Washington is helping combat COVID and what private companies can learn from the ROI metrics of universities and public institutions.\nDan and Matt also took some time to geek out about GitLab.\nWe hope this conversation was as enlightening for you as it was for us and we hope it helps you find your next great hire.\n\n\n \nHow Matt’s autism diagnosis changed his career\nHiring neurodiverse talent\nInclusive interview best practices for neurodiverse candidates\nROI metrics: public sector vs private sector\nUW’s data team and its efforts to combat COVID\nYou're Invited to INTERACT on April 7th - It's online & it's free!\n\n\nBack by popular demand, Dev Interrupted has announced it will be hosting the next iteration of its engineering leadership conference, INTERACT 2.0.

One role of this memory is acting as a ledger, saying who owns how much Ether, the cryptocurrency supported by the Ethereum network. The computers participating in this network are called “nodes” or “miners”, and the computational power they contribute is what keeps the EVM running. For their work, they are rewarded with Ether, hence the term “miners”.

I originally joined the DEV Team in June of 2019 as a Business Development and Growth Intern. Although I had been an intern for some time, my colleagues have always respected me as a significant part of the team through-and-through. \nTwo-and-a-half years later, I graduated from The College of New Jersey with my Bachelor's in English. Now, I'm becoming a part of the DEV Team full-time as a Developer Marketing Associate! It's a really exciting change and I'm looking forward to every part of it. \nBetween work and school, I have not had a lot of time to improve my programming skills and engage with the community on a personal level. I hope to change this over the course of the next few months. I'm certain you will all be seeing more of me as I tackle this new position. Wish me luck!\nIf you have any questions or comments — or just want to chat — don't hesitate to reach out! Shoot me an email or a DM on the DEV Community Discord (Where I'll be waaaaay quicker to respond to you. Join if you haven't yet!).",

          "description": "开始这篇文章之前，先说说这两天我在清理电脑存储上的一个插曲。\n有着良好电脑使用习惯的我，直到上一次打开 Mac 的储存空间界面，还始终保持着预留至少 50G 的空间来避免可用存储空间过少造成的「心理健康」问题，直到某天清理电脑无用软件时，突然发现电脑只剩 20G 可用，就在那一瞬间，我觉得我与存储空间的多年战斗宣告完败。\n一番排查过后，最占用存储空间的是不出意外的微信和企业微信两大「巨头」，足足有 60G 的空间消耗。这些聊天记录的缓存，在电脑端占用的空间寸土寸金，却不让我十分珍惜，因为他们杂乱无章，脱离了微信就再也无法访问，偶尔同步最近记录还会抽风，语音同步也是个老大难问题，想要全量的聊天记录检索，必须搬出已经占用 10G 的手机微信。\n想到前一阵子微信拟推出付费的聊天记录云端存储功能，以及越来越大的微信存储占用，我开始未雨绸缪，考虑谨慎处理我已经愈渐庞大和失控的微信数据。\n定期的全量备份以建立保障\n微信自带的备份和迁移\n因为一直是 iPhone 用户，所以能够采取的备份方案一般也以官方的为主。下图这两个界面应该所有人都不陌生，电脑端提供的一直都是备份和恢复的操作，而如果是换手机的场景，也支持将设备连接到同一 WiFi，直接在手机间迁移聊天记录。这两个方案都能解决问题，但如果聊天记录过多的话，同步速度会不太可控。\n\n说到手机间迁移聊天记录的场景，ColorOS、MIUI 等国内 Android 系统基本都支持微信数据的云端同步功能，部分 Android 系统还支持选择性恢复聊天记录，不仅对于聊天记录的留存多一份保障，还让随时可能过期的临时文件得以自动地存储下来。\n相比而言，iOS 虽然也具备机器间数据整体的迁移功能，不过前提是需要借助电脑或 iCloud 云端同步来实现。需要说明的是，iCloud 的备份是对于 iOS 本地文件的「一锅端」，相比微信自带备份功能的缺点是只…",

          "description": "《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。\n我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。\n音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。\n\n\n关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n妖刀王\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\nCOMIC LO杂志前一百期有哪些经典内容？\n如何制作一张好的学术海报（poster）？",

          "description": "三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。\n\nWTCR是什么\n讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。\n\n拿到WTCR冠军有多难？\n既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。\n\n摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。\n\n有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。\n\n这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.\n\n在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。\n\n拿到这个冠军有什么意义？\n一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。\n\n在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。\n\n中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。\n\n对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。\n\n对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。\n\n而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n鲁超\n点击下载\n9 个回答，查看全部。\n领克02hatchback和领克032.0冠军版怎么选？\n领克03冠军版与03+驭风版你会选择那个？",

          "description": "看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧\n先上个答案：会也不会\n我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是16岁拿的驾照17岁买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车，没有国内驾驶经验但是北美交规和限速也差不多。总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的，在两个方面都有足够的经验可以说明问题。\n我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。\n赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。\n公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。\n加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…\n至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…\n总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nCoalescence\n点击下载\n37 个回答，查看全部。\n赛车手需要学习漂移吗？\n如果中国有一条不限速的直道公路，你愿意来飙车车吗？",

          "description": "这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：\n1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。\n“盐者，百肴之将”[1]，意思就是盐为\"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。\n同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。\n\n比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。\n比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。\n比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。\n\n\n另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。\n2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性\n人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。\n可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。\n糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。\n3. 盐的可获得性高于糖\n盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。\n大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。\n而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。\n\n综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。\n如果你感兴趣其他关于味觉感官和厨房原理的回答，这里还有一些我回答过其他有意思的问题：\n为什么捏住鼻子就不会尝到味道？\n你是明白了哪几个基本原理之后而厨艺大增的？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n卫小妖GOGOGO\n点击下载\n76 个回答，查看全部。\n有没有替代味精的天然调味品？\n有哪些值得推荐的调味品？",

          "description": "Linux 有助于弥合数字鸿沟，延长硬件的使用寿命，使得它成为操作系统的一个环保选择。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n与大流行病作斗争，造成了生产新电脑所需的微芯片的短缺。此外，一些较新的专有操作系统提高了它们的硬件标准（LCTT 译注：Windows 11，别扭头看别人）。这个难题为我们这些在日常生活中使用 Linux 的人创造了一个机会。\n\r\n延长硬件的生命周期\n\r\n长期以来，Linux 一直以延长老旧硬件的寿命而闻名。这种能力对那些每天使用电脑的人来说是个福音。\n\r\n在过去的一年里，我已经帮助许多人使用 Linux 翻新和 改装旧电脑。基于 Linux 的电脑耗电更少，启动速度更快。Gnome 桌面很好，但许多旧电脑更适合 LXDE 或 XFCE 环境，它们运行需要较少的资源。\n\r\n像 FreeGeek 和 Kramden Institute 这样的组织已经把弥合数字鸿沟作为他们的核心使命，并以此为目标。这些团体对旧电脑进行了再利用，使它们不被当成垃圾填埋，而是把它们送到需要它们的用户手中。没有 Linux，就没有这些项目。\n\r\nDD-Wrt、OpenWrt 和 Tomato 都是 Linux 解决方案，使旧的网络硬件不被当成垃圾丢弃，并同时为用户的路由器提供更多的安全、隐私和性能。\n\r\n借助 GalliumOS 和 Mrchromebox.tech，即使是 Chromebooks 在谷歌停止支持后也能获得新的生命。\n\r\n新的机会\n\r\nLinux 创造了一些本来不存在的机会。学生和业余爱好者都在没有投资的情况下开始了计算机科学的成功事业，这要归功于他们在旧电脑上学到的经验。这些系统运行企业级软件，如 LAMP 栈，它促进了向 “Web 2.0” 的过渡。它是最早的 Web 开源软件栈之一。今天，它为 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla 系统提供了动力。事实上，Linux 为超过 96% 的世界前 100 万台 Web 服务器提供动力。Linux 还管理着 嵌入式系统、电子阅读器、智能电视、智能手表 等等。Linux 是世界上远远 超过 70% 的智能手机的操作系统。甚至美国国家航空航天局（NASA）今年在火星上创造历史的 毅力号，也是由 Linux 驱动的。\n\r\n为当今大多数应用提供动力的云计算，没有 Linux 就不可能存在。今天的大多数 Web 和智能手机应用都在基于 Linux 的 容器 中运行。即使在微芯片短缺和专有系统成本高昂的情况下，进入云服务行业的人也有机会学习开源的操作系统和软件。\n\r\n未来\n\r\n但最恰当的是，Linux 和开源为 联合国可持续发展目标 提供了动力。随着大流行的继续，Linux 仍然是一个重要的资源。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/linux-sustainable-os\n\r\n作者：Don Watkins 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "KDE 开始 15 分钟错误消除计划\n\r\n该计划用于集中修复许多影响 KDE 桌面的低级错误，这些错误用户在 15 分钟或更短时间内就能发现。其列入标准是，这些错误受 KDE 的默认设置影响，100% 可重现，一些基本的东西不工作或看起来有视觉上的缺陷，可能导致崩溃，需要重启或终端命令来解决或没有解决方法，最近回退的错误，或有超过五个重复的错误报告。在该计划中，第一批 有 56 个错误需要处理。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这些不起眼而很重要的工作，才真正能将 KDE 打磨成主流桌面环境。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nOpera 发布专门的内置加密钱包的浏览器\n\r\nOpera 发布 了一个 Web3 Crypto 浏览器，内置加密货币钱包，更易于访问加密货币/NFT 交易所、去中心化应用 dApp 等。Opera 表示新浏览器旨在简化 Web3 用户体验。Web3 是基于区块链的去中心化互联网，是目前加密货币支持者最热衷的新事物。该浏览器的钱包支持包括以太坊、比特币等加密货币。不过，该浏览器在国内被禁止使用。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 Opera 逐渐从主流浏览器中落后，但是它专注于游戏、加密货币等领域的努力还是值得赞赏。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n因 5G 干扰，国际航空公司正在减少飞往美国的航班\n\r\n美国的移动电话公司正在推出的 5G 服务，使用频率在 3.7 至 3.98GHz 之间的无线电频谱，即所谓的 C 波段。国际航空业担心美国 5G 服务过于接近雷达高度计使用的频谱，也就是 4.2 至 4.4GHz 之间，因而正在减少飞往美国的航班。但国际航空业认为，欧洲没有面临同样的风险，在欧洲，5G 服务使用频率较慢的 3.4 至 3.8GHz 范围的频谱，和雷达高度仪使用的频谱之间有更大的缓冲区。此外，欧洲也限制了机场附近的 5G 天线的功率和角度，避免了对飞机的干扰。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：新技术带来的新挑战，不知道国内的 5G 情况如何。",

          "description": "POSIX，你肯定在各种在线论坛和文章中，听到过这个缩写，或读到过关于它的信息。程序员和系统开发人员似乎最关心这个问题。它听起来很神秘，虽然有很多关于这个主题的好资料，但一些讨论区（简洁是它们的特点）并没有详细说明它是什么，这可能会让人困扰。那么，POSIX 到底是什么？\n\r\n\n\r\nPOSIX 简介\n\r\n与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。\n\r\n当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。\n\r\n该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。\n\r\n为什么有 POSIX？\n\r\n一句话：可移植性。\n\r\n60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。\n\r\nIBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。\n\r\n不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…",

          "description": "TongTX: “下午 2-3 点我需要占用测试环境联调项目，大家不要发布喔！”\n看到群里的消息我内心一阵苦恼，由于公司使用的是微服务架构并将其部署在了 Kubernetes 集群上，因此团队负责开发的服务是整个微服务架构其中的一环，整个系统的正常运行需要依赖微服务系统中的上下游服务，这导致每每到了发新版本的窗口期，大家都开始占用测试环境联调测试自己开发的功能，导致排队使用测试环境的情况。\n今天是发版日，我也需要将自己的功能发布至测试环境验证功能是否正确，有人占用测试环境的话会导致我无法随意测试与修复功能，排队使用测试环境会影响我的发布效率，到时候又要被产品经理吐槽上线慢了:(\n“那我安排在 3-4 点” 团队里另一名工程师在群里说。\n看到测试环境的使用时间不断被挤压，我也顾不上是否需真要用一个小时，赶紧在群里喊“我预期 5 点开 PR 合并代码，所以 4-5 点我要测试一下，用好了会通知大家。”\n想必各位使用微服务架构的同仁和我有一样的困扰，那就是“集成测试联调真的太他丫讨厌了！”，尤其一到发新版本的窗口期，测试环境简直犹如网红餐厅，大排长龙，各个功能都要测，只能乖乖等。很多公司和我在的这家企业一样，只有一套测试环境，一到发版前各个项目时间都很紧，全挤一起。尤其现在敏捷开发迭代周期越来越短，测试也越来越频繁，测试环境着实是不够用啊。\n于是我去找了找目前有没有能解决这个问题的方案，发现有一些工具链可以解决这个排队耗时问题，比如 TeamCode( https://www.teamcode.com)新推出的微服务集成测试工具 KubeOrbit( https://www.kubeorbit.io)，帮助团队高效测试微服务。\n我打开他发来的产品文档，发现此工具允许我在公司测试环境的 Kubernetes 集群中定义基准环境：\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment version=base\n我还可以基于基准环境创建不同的测试通道，比如测试环境 1 和测试环境 2：\n# Create a test env with name v1\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version=v1\n# Create a test env with name v2\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version=v2\n将自己的服务加入目标测试环境\napiVersion: network.kubeorbit.io/v1alpha1\nkind: ServiceRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: serviceroute-sample\n  namespace: sample-namespace\nspec:\n  name: pod-svc\n  # Add your service to the test env named with v1 by defining trafficRoutes\n  trafficRoutes:\n    routes:\n      - name: v1\n        labels:\n          version: v1\n        headers:\n          version:\n            exact: v1\n    default:\n      version: base\n部署到目标测试环境中   \nkubectl apply -f /path/to/your/serviceroute.yaml\n使用体验总结\nKubeOrbit 工具主要有如下三种功能：在微服务测试环境内创建测试通道，这样就可以获得一个单独稳定的集成测试环境；把需要测试的微服务添加至测试通道中，将它们与其他不同版本的微服务隔离开来；在发起微服务请求的时候指定测试通道，KubeOrbit 会将其转发至你所指定的测试通道。这些功能刚好解决了我和团队耗时排队测试的困境，满足了团队测试的需求：\n1. 团队内部并行开发与联调测试的需求，大家无需再争抢使用测试环境\n2. 按时交付项目的需求，避免了因为测试环境不够导致项目延期的情况\n无需调整已有的技术栈和架构，KubeOrbit 会适配现有的微服务，还能够隔离不同测试通道之间的通讯。但是在产品的使用过程中，我发现还需要有较多的人工操作，增加了这个工具的使用门槛。如果能够把这些流程自动化，会给用户体验带来较大幅度的提升。刚好从公众号得知产品在 GitHub （ https://github.com/teamcode-inc/kubeorbit ）全部开源的消息，我也打算好好研究一下，持续关注这个项目和平台，希望未来有更好的体验。",
