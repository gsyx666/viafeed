Today, we're going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.\nOf course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we're going to worry about creating the actual spinner!\n\nFor this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).\nWe start with just a very simple structure in our html.\n<div class=\"spinner\">\n  <img src=\"./rainbow.png\" class=\"img\"/>\n</div>\n\nTip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.\nTo create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we'll create a keyframe animation called spin:\n @keyframes spin {\n   0% {\n     transform: rotate(0deg);\n   }\n   100% {\n     transform: rotate(360deg);\n   }\n }\n\nNow, let's style our actual spinner!\n\nWe created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:\n .spinner {\n   height: 100vh;\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n }\n\nNow, for the actual image:\n .img {\n   height: 150px;\n   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;\n }\n\nNow we have a working spinner!\nWant to see the full tutorial? Watch the YouTube video below or watch in on CodeCast to get access to all the code in the Player!\n\n\n\n\nFor more of my content, follow me on like Twitter & CodeCast! \nYou can also read my last blog here:\nCreate A Portfolio Website with only HTML & CSS\nAmy Oulton ・ Jan 13 ・ 4 min read\n#html\n        #css\n        #webdev\n        #codenewbie\n      \n.",

Trying to use the defaultValue prop in react won't work either. if you add a value prop to the textarea the value of the text will be displayed but then it won't be editable, this is because the value prop is immutable.\nPassing a value prop to textarea like this <textarea value={'Hello World'}> </textarea>, will display the text Hello World on the textbox, but it won't be editable to make it editable we need to pass the a state to the value prop and update that state with the onChange prop like the code below.\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction TextBox () {\n\n    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello World');\n\n   return (\n           <textarea \n             value={text} \n             onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) }>\n          </textarea>\n         );\n\n}\n\nexport default TextBox;\n\n\nInside the TextBox component, I initialize the text state with 'Hello World' and passed it to the textarea as a value prop, this will be the initial text displayed in the text area. onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) } this line of code updates the text state, with the new value.\nYou can learn more about handling form in react here",

APIs inherently come with their own HTTP overhead, which means every time you call an API, you have to wait a little bit for the HTTP response.\nThis is mostly fine, but if you have an application with a lot of time sensitive and frequent server requests, it can become a problem. A good example of this is a chat app, where you need to see what the other person is saying immediately. APIs can still work in this scenario, but it's not the best solution for the job.\nIn this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up a websocket server in Vue.JS, using a websocket server built in Node.JS and express.

          "description": "最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。\n但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。\n\n一、带宽进化的历史\n我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。\n56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。\n\n我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。\n后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。\n21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。\n\nADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。\n2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。\n\n从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。\n二、家庭的入户带宽\n现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。\n\n\n申请…",

          "description": "今天是大年初三，第四集，先给大家拜个年。\n几集播完，引发的一波波舆论有我们想到的、没想到的，千言万语化作一句话“咱老李啥时候有过这热度？”也许是我们一路来收到太多关于老李的负面言论，这么一下子我们都有些不适应。不过还请珍惜雪儿的独角戏。\n另一方面从我个人而言，受邀来此只为了和大家分享，我会很认真的对待，有些评论虽然言语激烈但是说的在理，忠言逆耳再难听也得听着，听完还得寻思寻思，反手再说句谢谢。但对于那些只为发泄的言论，只能表示理解。\n回归正题！先给大家放几张图。\n\n当时我们寻思疗伤这事儿咋样能好玩有看点，又不能太肆意妄为，因为事儿赶着事儿，不能太放纵喽。所以感谢舒导啊，强烈建议美人出浴搞点福利，并带着我反复研究学习女神塞隆著名的某广告，最终成功被删减，不过万幸，没有全部删掉。\n\n这些则是最后一场戏的删减，其实还好，只是删了特写和全景中尸体的数量，无非是最后的冲击力少了些。但难受的是我们“有始有终”的巴也，他的死亡特写删掉替换成破损的单钺，我怕有人误会他跑了，其实没有，他走了，还走得特别不安详doge，他的死状请记住，死的方式很有特点，会是谁的功法呢~\n再说说最后一场戏巴也率人追来，不知道大家觉得压迫感如何，那场戏的气氛灵感来自英剧《浴血黑帮》，几个身着黑衣面容阴郁的挺拔男子，伴随着身后工厂的滚滚蒸汽大步行来，让我备受震撼。\n\n\n\n再有个有意思的就是，姬如雪被巴也一脚跺晕，一开始踩的是肚子，但总感觉从构图到反应都不够冲击力，于是略作调整后，看到这里的同事无不以“卧槽”开头，尤其是磊哥，“卧槽！这TM都踩胸上了！”巴也这脚踩的有多狠，他后面走的就有多刺激。\n最后再跟大家唠唠这一集最精彩的段落，姬如雪的“鸿门宴”。\n不知道有没有小伙伴看过上映前，有一个叫“兖州大殿”的场景PV。那里面都是我们一开始的设想，偌大的破败古庙，两侧监国锦衣持刀而立，行注目礼，压力直给。那是美好的设想，压迫感是来了，但最后要是无双也太没意思（其实就是人多拍不起）。于是我们加入了巴也四徒（四人面具是喜怒哀乐，有看出来的嘛），设计了一场3D立体打姬。\n运镜、动作编排这些就不细说了，好不好观众评判，这次从耳朵出发——音效和音乐。\n首先音效，这场戏是多人混战，同时武器驳杂调度也大，特别适合作为例子来聊。在那个追着我要头发的音效师那里是第一步……\n\n我们需要把细节、比例、大小、方向全部处理好，好的音效就是让你注意不到，同画面永远是一体的，是最真实的表达。但是当离开录音棚，离开拥有高解析和声场的监听级设备，很多东西就会被捏在一起，不是每个人都有好几千的耳机或音响设备去体验的，所以就来到了最后一步，就是我需要带上一个平价的耳机同时使用电脑自带的音响，再处理一遍音效。主要处理声音的重点，尽量保留细节同时把距离感和力度突出来，这种处理方式会有损音效本身的精度，但会让大部分设备都能更直接感受到我们所想表达的内容。放假走的匆匆，没拍照，有机会给大家看看剪辑软件上音轨的调整画面~\n音乐也是同理，甚至更甚，毛大师那边就会用好几种喇叭模拟各种设备的效果，当然架不住坏的啊。记得刚播出那天，模型有个小姑娘看完输出的mov，跑过来慌慌张张告诉我\n“李导李导，OP的声音有问题呀，念白听不清楚啊。”\n我都惊了，急匆匆赶去拿起她的耳机，她告诉我\n“导儿，用左耳，右耳是坏的”\n我好像意识到什么，但还是拿起左耳带上，传出的声音就跟把你裹着被子沉海里一样，左边的解析一样有问题。所以啊，咱们有条件我强烈推荐戴耳机观看，稍稍在意一下自己的体感，求求了~\n接着音乐部分，这一集可真是把我纠结死了，为姬如雪单独写了首《巾帼》，如果看到片尾的小伙伴可能会发现，片尾的曲子与姬如雪独战是一个旋律，它们都是《巾帼》。最终通过版其实是片尾这一首，从姬如雪拄剑站起，拔出匕首，大家可以试试把这个音乐贴上去，递进感更强更燃更合适，但问题是！音乐中的两次高潮，旋律是一样的，从姬如雪撞断柱子“而是，让他带我走！”这里开始，本想所有动效都摘掉，全靠音乐炸起来，结果，结果就是没炸起来……\n\n当时我意识到，这种问题给毛大师淦碎了也没用，周期不等人，所有环节继续，到最终定剪时，我一咬牙，决定取上一版Demo的前半段保留最终版的后半段，在旋律上做些区别，音效也配合垫上一些，尽可能加大前后落差以增强冲击力。我都做好前面直接用Demo的准备了，毛大师知道后，赶在交片前重新录制调整，才有了两首不一样的《巾帼》，感谢毛亮老师，你简直是我们的HERO！\n这些问题都是不到最后感觉不到的，突发状况，最后将进击版《巾帼》放在片尾我觉得还挺酷的，本来这集是要放原点的嘿嘿，再等等，下一集更合适！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n十万个秋刀鱼\n点击下载\n78 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价《画江湖之不良人》第 5 季第 3 集？\n如何评价《画江湖之不良人》第五季？",

          "description": "今天除夕，然而今年除夕不是“大年三十”，是“大年廿九”。\n理解这个事情，有几个层次。\n第一层：还有多少“大年廿九”？\n我考察了前后各一个世纪（1920s-2110s）的数据，发现两百年间，有118个“大年三十”、83个“大年廿九”。列表如下：\n“大”表示30天的大月，“小”表示29天的小月\n第二层：为什么会有三十/廿九（大小月）的差别？\n因为月相变化周期（朔望月）的平均长度是29.530588天，不是整数。农历为了确保每个“朔”（新月）都在初一，必须根据实际月相调整每个月的长度，使之取29天或30天。\n当然，你可能意识到了，“平均长度”意味着每个朔望月的长度是可以有变化的。实际上变化范围可以相当大：从不足29.3天到29.8天多，可以浮动半天还多。\n\n第三层：那么大小月是由朔望周期决定的吗？\n不难理解，不只由朔望周期决定。\n假设这个月的新月开始于某天0时，假设这个月的朔望周期是29.5天，那么下一个新月出现在第30天中午12点——也就是说第30天会被定义为下个月初一，本月就只能享有29天，成为小月。\n但如果这个月的新月开始于某天12时之后，下一个新月出现在第31天午夜0时之后，那么第31天才会被定义为下个月初一，本月可以成为拥有30天的“大月”。\n所以，大小月由两个参数决定：本月月初的新月出现在几点，以及本月的朔望周期。如下图所示。\n图中橙色、蓝色点的分界线，就是次月新月刚好卡在第30天、第31天之间的午夜0时的情况。\n\n第四层：为什么“大年三十”比“大年廿九”多？\n按照朔望周期平均29.53天考虑，大月、小月的数量之比应该是53:47～1.13。\n我统计了1921到2121这两个世纪，其中大月有1319个，小月有1167个，1319:1167=1.130，完全符合预期。\n但是，同期的大年三十和大年廿九的比例，却是118:83=1.42，比预期的1.13显著更大，这是为什么呢？\n我画出朔望周期在每年各个月份的分布：\n\n可以看出，年底年初的朔望周期，平均来说比年中的朔望周期要长4个小时——这是因为，地球在1月份到达近日点，绕日公转最快，此时月球需要追更长时间才能到达同样的相位，因此朔望周期较长。\n因此农历十二月，也就有更大的机会分到大月。\n\n总结：\n朔望月的平均长度是29.530588天，但是可以在约29.3到29.8之间浮动。\n农历大小月取决于当月和下月的新月出现在哪天。或者说，取决于当月月初的新月时刻和该月朔望周期。\n虽然大小月的总体比例接近53:47，但是腊月的大小月比例显著较高，可达1.42，因此大年多“三十”，较少“廿九”。\n你明白了吗？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n刘博洋\n点击下载",

          "description": "如果你看到了这篇文章，那么恭喜你，你将成为全中国最先了解“维C黄脸”真相的一批人。\n关于用了维C为什么脸黄，目前中文互联网上的解释都很牵强。于是我去查了一下文献，发现事实远比想象的复杂。除了脸变黄外，手掌，指甲缝还有手指缝都有可能变黄，这种变黄没法用清洁产品洗掉，只能等皮肤慢慢代谢掉。停用之后，基本上一两个星期，皮肤变黄就会消失，而且你会发现肤色比用之前更提亮了一个色号。\n目前中文互联网对于维C变黄的解释很牵强\n关于为什么维C上脸之后，有些人会变黄，目前中文互联网的主流说法是维C的氧化。因为一些维C精华放久了之后，会呈现出比较深的颜色。于是自然而然的认为维C上脸之后被氧化，也是染黄皮肤的元凶。但是这过程中，大家常常忽略一个点，那就是维C精华的颜色并没有深到可以染黄皮肤的地步。\n我手头正好有一瓶接近保质期的维C精华，大家可以看到颜色非常深。\n\n把精华滴一点到手上，颜色对比非常明显，然而涂开之后，对皮肤的颜色根本没有影响。\n\n这是因为维C氧化之后，颜色虽然会变深，但是真正有颜色的成分非常少。这些成分又都是水溶性的，根本没法染黄我们的皮肤。\n用了维C脸黄的元凶竟然是它\n为了搞清楚用了维C脸黄的原因，我查找了大量文献，终于找到了合理的解释。维C染黄角质层的元凶其实是维C代谢的产物之一：赤藓酮糖。\n看到赤藓酮糖这四个字，你的第一反应一定是：这是什么鬼？\n\n实际上，赤藓酮糖在国外可是个大大有名的成分，它是欧美常用的美黑剂。\n和亚洲人不同，欧美人喜欢颜色深的皮肤，这样的人被认为是有钱去海边度假，所以看起来给人感觉比较健康比较美。然而不是所有人都有钱有时间去海边度假，于是国外专门有一类美黑护肤品，而这个赤藓酮糖就是美黑剂的主要成分。它能和角化细胞中的角蛋白结合，形成类黑素，从而让皮肤颜色看起来更深。\n\n由赤藓酮糖来的类黑素并不是黑色的，而是红棕色，当用量较少的时候，看起来就是黄不拉几的颜色。实际上，赤藓酮糖的短期使用效果和维C染黄脸的效果一毛一样！\n\n从维C到赤藓酮糖，鬼知道我经历了什么\n维C的氧化是个非常复杂的过程[1]。简单来说，维C（抗坏血酸）先会变成脱氢抗坏血酸。随后脱氢抗坏血酸进一步变成2,3-二酮古洛糖酸。以此为基础，接下来是非常复杂的化学反应，生成的产物也非常多。而赤藓酮糖就是其中的产物之一。\n\n根据实验，一份维C如果氧化降解完全，可以生成至多0.28份赤藓酮糖，这个转化率相当高了。一般欧美使用赤藓酮糖作为美黑剂，这个成分的添加量是5%。所以如果维C精华含有15%的维C，如果全部氧化完全，相当于4.2%的赤藓酮糖，和欧美主流的美黑剂差不多了。\n好在现在主流的维C精华都使用各种方式来稳定维C，维C降解不多。上脸之后，如果做好防晒，停留在角质层中的维C被氧化的概率也不太大。产生的赤藓酮糖也就非常少了。\n脸黄了怎么办？\n很多人用维C明明是为了提亮肤色，结果脸变黄了，郁闷的同时还不免担心起来，染黄的脸洗都洗不掉！\n其实用了维C之后脸变黄大可不必焦虑，直接停用维C就是了。停止使用之后，也就缺少了赤藓酮糖的输入，皮肤中也就不会形成类黑素，皮肤就不会继续变黄。\n而根据赤藓酮糖的工作原理，它一般只作用于角质层最外层的一些角化细胞。而且我们的皮肤也会正常代谢。随着皮肤的代谢，这些染黄的角化细胞基本上一周就会代谢干净，最长不会超过两周。\n如果你又喜欢维C的功效，又不想皮肤变黄，那么还有个办法就是搭配使用一些果酸类的产品。日常使用维C的时候，手指手掌处的染黄会更明显，因为这些地方的角质层更厚，有更多的角蛋白和赤藓酮糖反应。使用一些温和的果酸类产品剥脱角质层，让角质层薄一些，脸黄就不那么明显了。当然，在使用果酸之前，得确保自己皮肤耐受，而且不是敏感肌。\n\n\n小结一下，用维C脸变黄并不是因为简单的氧化。而是因为维C转化成了赤藓酮糖，而这个成分能和角化细胞结合，形成类黑色素，从而染黄角质层。解决的问题很简单，要么停用维C，脸黄一两周就会消失；要么使用温和的果酸轻微剥脱角质层，减少黄气。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n胖博士\n点击下载\n29 个回答，查看全部。\n直接将vc捣碎用水溶解然后喷在脸上能美白吗？\nVC在护肤品中的形式如何和浓度多少？",

          "description": "Nitrux 2.0.0 是一个令人兴奋的版本，它默认采用 XanMod 内核，并 带来了其他各种视觉和技术改进。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNitrux Linux 轻松成为了 最漂亮的 Linux 发行版 之一。\n\r\n上个月，我们点评了 Maui Shell，它也是由 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队所设计的。现在，Nitrux 2.0.0 已经发布，并带来了一些令人兴奋的变化。\n\r\n让我在这里重点介绍一下基本变化。\n\r\nNitrux 2.0.0 有什么新东西？\n\r\n这次升级包括一个新的 Linux 内核、更新的应用程序、桌面环境、固件改进，以及大大减小了 ISO 的大小。\n\r\n你还会注意到布局和顶部面板等几处细微视觉变化。\n\r\nXanMod 内核 5.16.3\n\r\n\n\r\nXanMod 内核是为新一代硬件量身定做的，以获得尽可能好的桌面体验。\n\r\n与许多其他 Linux 发行版中自带的 Linux 内核相比，你会发现它有一些自定义设置和新功能，可以提高你的使用体验。\n\r\n在 Nitrux 2.0.0 中，默认选择了 XanMod 内核 5.16.3。当然你仍然可以选择最新的主线 LTS 或非 LTS（5.15.17、5.16.3）Linux 内核。\n\r\n别忘了，如果你需要，你还可以安装 Liquorix 和 Libre 内核。\n\r\n更新布局和面板的变化\n\r\n顶部面板现在显示了窗口控制、标题、全局菜单和系统托盘区。\n\r\n布局仍然与以前的版本相似，但有一些位置的调整，比如将应用程序菜单添加到基座dock中，应用程序菜单是 Launchpad Plasma（感谢 adhe）。\n\r\n\n\r\n此外，你应会发现窗口装饰有了改进，所有窗口现在默认都是无边框的。你可以在外观设置下的窗口装饰选项中选择禁用无边框窗口模式。\n\r\n可选的 Latte 布局也得到了更新，包括窗口控制、标题栏和全局菜单。\n\r\n更新的软件包和驱动程序\n\r\n出于显而易见的原因，这次升级包括 KDE Plasma 版本更新、KDE 框架、KDE 装备，以及其他必要的应用程序，如 Firefox 和 LibreOffice。\n\r\n此外，为 AMD GPU 增加了内核软件包中没有的额外固件。他们还在可下载的 ISO 中增加了 i915、Nouveau 和 AMDGPU 驱动。\n\r\n默认使用的是 MESA 21.3.5 稳定版，但如果你需要的话，可以安装最新的 MESA 22.0。\n\r\n其他改进\n\r\n在 Nitrux Linux 的这些变化之外，还有一些额外的技术改进，如：\n\r\n\r\n减少了标准版和精简版的 ISO 文件大小。\n\r\nXbox One 控制器的工作原理与操纵杆没有冲突。\n\r\n在精简版 ISO 中，JWM 取代了 i3 窗口管理器。\n\r\n\r\n更多细节，你可以参考 官方公告。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/nitrux-2-0-release/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "英特尔为 Linux 开发“软件定义芯片”功能\n\r\n去年 9 月以来，英特尔一直在正在开发一个允许激活特定 CPU 功能的 Linux 内核驱动，这让人想起十年前的英特尔升级服务，它可以通过软件在某些酷睿 CPU 上激活特定功能。这个 功能 允许通过驱动程序和加密许可证，在特定的 CPU 上单独购买并激活特定的功能。但是英特尔并没有披露他们计划使用该驱动在未来的 CPU 上提供什么样的功能。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：可能有些人不知道，你购买的芯片中的某些电路其实没有工作的，而通过这个功能，以后就可以有选择性地付钱激活使用了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n黑莓以 6 亿美元出售其移动和信息专利\n\r\n黑莓将这些围绕黑莓手机、QWERTY 键盘和黑莓信使（BBM）的 专利出售 给一家名为 Catapult 的新公司。在 2018 年黑莓曾将这些专利作为武器来对付 Facebook Messenger。有意思的是，这 6 亿美元的交易提供的资金中有 1.5 亿美元是期票。也就是说这家新公司，有大量的债务，没有产品，也没有现金流。这大概意味着起诉所有它认为侵犯了其新收购的专利资产的公司。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：没料到黑莓最后所剩不多的遗产居然是专利索赔。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nOpenSSF 启动 Alpha-Omega 项目\n\r\n该项目 已经获得了 500 万美元的启动资金，并得到了包括微软、谷歌等的支持。Alpha-Omega 将系统地寻找开源代码中尚未发现的新漏洞，然后与项目维护者合作，使其得到修复，来提升全球开源软件供应链的安全性。该项目中的 “Alpha” 代表将帮助最关键的开源项目（包括独立项目和核心生态系统服务）的维护者识别和修复安全漏洞。而 “Omega” 则确定至少 10,000 个广泛部署的开源软件项目，将自动安全分析、评分和补救指导等应用于其维护者社区。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看起来近来几次开源供应链的事故让业界行动起来了，希望能见到实际的效果。",

          "description": "它不是每个人的理想选择，但作为一个 Linux 爱好者，我喜欢用它做实验。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当 Pine64 在 2019 年发布 PinePhone 时，没有人能够预见它将对移动 Linux、桌面 Linux 和隐私产生巨大的影响。\n\r\n作为 少数专为运行桌面 Linux 而设计的手机 之一，它具有低端安卓手机的所有功能，同时又具有笔记本电脑的多功能性。不幸的是，桌面 Linux 就是这样：它是为台式机设计的，而不是为手机设计的。\n\r\n幸运的是，由于 GNOME、KDE、Pine64 和众多 Linux 社区的惊人力量，全新的桌面环境、应用程序和发行版应运而生。其中一些比较知名的包括 Plasma Mobile、Phosh、Megapixels 和Mobian。\n\r\n有了这些所有关键的部分，Pine64 需要做的就是销售 PinePhone，他们确实也卖出了 PinePhone。每一轮社区版（每个都预装了不同的发行版）的预购都收到了数千份订单，其中之一就是我的。\n\r\n自从我在 2020 年 12 月收到我的设备后，PinePhone 一直是我日常生活中的重要组成部分，我在 2021 年全年都把它作为我的日常设备。以下是我使用它的经验。\n\r\n它的性能就像糖浆一样\n\r\nPinePhone 采用了全志 a64 系统芯片，它的功率只够完成最基本的手机任务。即使是简单的事情，如打开火狐浏览器，也需要将近 20 秒的时间，这无疑要“归功于”它仅有的 4 个核心。这与现代中高端安卓手机形成鲜明对比，所有这些手机都有至少 2GHz 的 8 核处理器。\n\r\n幸运的是，社区再次介入，对数以千计的小型软件实施了优化。虽然性能仍然不如安卓系统的竞争对手，但这确实意味着 PinePhone 对于大多数手机任务来说是非常适用了，甚至在通过附带的底座使用外部显示器时，也可以使用一些面向桌面的应用程序。\n…",

On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty\nstraightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the\ninternet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for\neveryone!)\nBut when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One\nquestion is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing\nthem THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?\nI asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6\nand I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here.

Now offering book as an ePUB.\nUxn, re-wrote entire documentation, and started a project devlog.\nNasu, improved zoom tool, it is now possible to move between tiles(Masto) while zoomed.\nYufo, released a small game for the Virtual Pet Jam.\n100r, added new page: cast-iron cookware, and updated medical.\nNews\nOn January 28th Uxn turned 1 year old! We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed code, ideas, time and laughs to help this project grow into what it is now. It was a wonderful year for smol ordinators. See an image that Rekka made for uxn's birthday.\nWe finally released versions of the Uxn emulator for all major systems(Linux, OS X and Windows), with the option of a version bundled with a few starter roms. We simplified the guide too, to make it easier to install and use.\nOur lion's mane mushroom grew another full head, we harvested it and made some mushroom pakoras.\nIn other news, Devine was interviewed on Anonradio, listen to it here. Also, Compudanzas released an Introduction to Uxn Programming book, with a foreword by Devine.\nPino book club\nWe're reading The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino, and The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity by David Graeber.\nContinue Reading",
