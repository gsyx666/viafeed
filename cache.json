A abreviação será \"border\".\n \nA propriedade \"outline-color\" é muito parecida com a propriedade de borda, porém, o outline serve para marcar/contornar o elemento que está em foco na página caso o usuário queira passar pelos itens usando o teclado e não o mouse.\nAssim como a borda, o outline-color também precisa da definição da largura e do tipo do contorno para assim refletir a cor. A sua abreviação é \"outline\".\n \nNormalmente as cores de outline ficam ocultas no código e apenas são visíveis quando o elemento de fato estiver em foco na página, de acordo com a navegação do usuário.\n \nA propriedade \"outline-offset\" adiciona um espaço transparente entre o contorno e a borda do elemento.\n\nCódigo do botão:\nCodepen\nDocumentação CSS:\nMDN Web Docs\nw3schools",

          "description": "The prospect of launching a website still feels incredibly exhilarating — even for those who have already launched numerous websites in the past.\nBut if you’re new to the game, you may have conducted some research and found that some web developers prefer to code websites in HTML, while others prefer to use something called a CMS (Content Management System).\nWhat is HTML?\nWithout HTML, we would have web pages that would look no less interesting than a page of unformatted text. HTML allows us to add style to text, insert and format images, embed video, customize fonts, add color, and a whole lot more.\nThe example below shows you the HTML coding for Core dna’s homepage:\n\nWhat is a Content Management System (CMS)?\nCommon CMS’ include Tumblr, WordPress, Joomla, Wix, and Drupal.\nOn the more advanced side of the spectrum, you’ll find ECM (Enterprise Content Management), which does everything a web CMS does, and then some. It supplements a typical web CMS features by facilitating collaboration in the workplace by integrating digital asset management, eCommerce, and document management into the mix. Going a step further, you’ll notice how most ECMs are becoming DXPs (Digital Experience Platforms), which help brands personalize content, deliver content to IoT devices, and much more.\nCMS vs HTML: What is the difference?\nYou see, with a CMS, you can often use pre-built templates to launch web pages more quickly. You can then customize those templates to make them your own. This is obviously a lot faster than coding something from scratch, and is especially useful if you have no coding knowledge.\nBut besides that, there are some significant differences between HTML-only websites and CMS-powered websites.\nFind out more at Core dna's blog on CMS vs HTML: Why Us a Content Management System?",

Feedback is powered to a considerable degree by tests.\nWhen tests slow development down, engineering teams lose momentum and become frustrated, because they can’t meet their goals. A slow test suite puts the brakes on CI/CD, making release and deployment more difficult. This often means that organizations can't ship out products on time, and risk losing their competitive edge.\nChoosing a scalable cloud platform like Semaphore is a great start. Semaphore offers some features that are helpful in dealing with slow tests, which we will discuss later in the article.\nTolerating a slow test suite is like making the minimum credit card payment when you could pay off your balance: by not …",

          "description": "Sometimes when you're running a Lighthouse performance check on your sites, you might come across the issue:\n<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute\n\nLuckily, this is a pretty easy thing to fix, whether you're using Next.js, or plain ol' HTML!\nIt's for accessibility! Screen readers often use a different sound library for each language they support. They can easily switch between those sound libraries, but only when a webpage specifies which language to use.\nTypically in your average Next.js website, the deployed page ships only a <html> wrapped site, with no language attribute attached.\nIf you were writing a plain HTML website (or using some other library that allows you to update the shipped HTML files), it would be a simple matter of adding a lang=\"en\" to your outputted HTML, like so:\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\nWith Next.js, it's a little bit more involved, but luckily not too difficult!\nInside of your pages/ directory (or wherever you put your page components), make a file called _document.js. This overrides the default document that is shipped with your Next.js site. Don't worry though, we won't break anything!\nInside of that file, add the following:\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang=\"en\"> {/* Add whichever language you want here */}\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n\nBoom, you're done! Make sure you don't delete the Html, Head, Main, and NextScript components, because they are required for your site to be properly rendered. Now, next time you run your performance and accessibility audits, your language settings should be in the clear!",

All we need is to pass the url and the xpath_query of the table.\nOur single line of code will look like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//tr\")\n\n\nSo basically we are telling the program to fetch any table row from the page and display it in our sheet. Easy, right?\nRemember that you can modify the xpath_query to fetch anything from the page.  For example, if I want to fetch the 22nd row of the table I change the function like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//table[1]/tbody/tr[24]\")\n\nIsn't it awesome? I bet it is. Hope you've learned something! :)",

I couldn't understand React at all, even after watching several tutorials and googling \"React for beginners\" lots of times.\nSome web developers said you don't need to study Javascript a lot, we don't use Javascript. We use React. So, you have to study React, not Javascript.\na JavaScript library. \nI wrote the whole code (add cart, delete cart, shop items are in class etc...) in Javascript. I didn't copy others' code at all, I thought myself how I operate it in Javascript. I was sure I have a solid knowledge of vanilla JS at last!\nhttps://gracious-khorana-5ef5d7.netlify.app/\nI restarted my React learning in September. I could understand it easily!!!\nI created my first React project in September it was a chatbot.\nhttps://vigorous-hoover-828c01.netlify.app/\nAnd I made a weather app using API in September.\nhttps://happy-hawking-f6969d.netlify.app/\nI wrote an article about React Hooks in December.\nhttps://dev.to/miacan2021/my-memorandum-react-hooks-usecontext-usereducer-usememo-usecallback-useref-3i4k\nAnd then, I created React Redux project in December.\nhttps://focustube.vercel.app/\nI'm sure I'm growing as a front-end developer very fast.\nThrough this process, I think I have escaped from being a complete programming beginner.

It's a book that is mostly an autobiography of a Holocaust survivor, but it's much more than a recital of what happened to her during the year that she spent at death camps. \nThe book was published in 2017, 72 years after she was deliberated at the age of 17. She had way more to share than the horror.\nHer second book, The Gift is the condensed version of what the author learnt as a psychologist both from herself and from her patients about leading a happy life. A life that is not full of resentment and hate. A life in which you could let things go and forgive yourself and others.\nThe lessons, her messages are organized around 12 prisons you lock yourself up to.\nI'm not going to discuss them one by one here…",

We do run into the case of repeated numerals causing an issue III, but we can clear that by multiplying num by any number between 2 and 4 before comparing it to res, since the numerals jump in value by 5x.\nOnce we know how to properly identify a subtractive numeral, it's a simple matter to just iterate in reverse through given numeral to find and return the res.\nfunction romanToInt(s: string): number {\n  let res: number = 0;\n  const symbols = {\n    I: 1,\n    V: 5,\n    X: 10,\n    L: 50,\n    C: 100,\n    D: 500,\n    M: 1000,\n  };\n  s.split(\"\")\n    .reverse()\n    .forEach((char) => {\n      let val: number = parseInt(symbols[char]);\n      if (res > 4 * val) {\n        res -= val;\n      } else {\n        res += val;\n      }\n    });\n  return res;\n}\n\nThis solution uses a lookup table composed which can help in easier conversion and much simple compared to the above one.\nfunction intToRoman(num: number): string {\n  let res:string = \"\";\n  const value:number [] = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];\n  const numerals:string [] = [\"M\",\"CM\",\"D\",\"CD\",\"C\",\"XC\",\"L\",\"XL\",\"X\",\"IX\",\"V\",\"IV\",\"I\"]\n  for (let i = 0; num; i++)\n    while (num >= value[i]){\n        res += numerals[i];\n         num -= value[i];\n    }\n  return res;\n}\n\nHere I have tried to solve them in typescript using ts-problems repo.\n🔁 original post at 🔗 Dev Post",

Today, we're going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.\nOf course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we're going to worry about creating the actual spinner!\n\nFor this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).\nWe start with just a very simple structure in our html.\n<div class=\"spinner\">\n  <img src=\"./rainbow.png\" class=\"img\"/>\n</div>\n\nTip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.\nTo create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we'll create a keyframe animation called spin:\n @keyframes spin {\n   0% {\n     transform: rotate(0deg);\n   }\n   100% {\n     transform: rotate(360deg);\n   }\n }\n\nNow, let's style our actual spinner!\n\nWe created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:\n .spinner {\n   height: 100vh;\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n }\n\nNow, for the actual image:\n .img {\n   height: 150px;\n   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;\n }\n\nNow we have a working spinner!\nWant to see the full tutorial?

Trying to use the defaultValue prop in react won't work either. if you add a value prop to the textarea the value of the text will be displayed but then it won't be editable, this is because the value prop is immutable.\nPassing a value prop to textarea like this <textarea value={'Hello World'}> </textarea>, will display the text Hello World on the textbox, but it won't be editable to make it editable we need to pass the a state to the value prop and update that state with the onChange prop like the code below.\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction TextBox () {\n\n    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello World');\n\n   return (\n           <textarea \n             value={text} \n             onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) }>\n          </textarea>\n         );\n\n}\n\nexport default TextBox;\n\n\nInside the TextBox component, I initialize the text state with 'Hello World' and passed it to the textarea as a value prop, this will be the initial text displayed in the text area. onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) } this line of code updates the text state, with the new value.\nYou can learn more about handling form in react here",

A good example of this is a chat app, where you need to see what the other person is saying immediately. APIs can still work in this scenario, but it's not the best solution for the job.\nIn this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up a websocket server in Vue.JS, using a websocket server built in Node.JS and express.

          "description": "随着人们卫生意识的提高，人们越发重视「菊花」的清洁，市场上兼具清洁、烘干、加热功能的智能马桶也渐渐普及。便后冲洗，洗去残留的粪便，还带烘干，保证了肛周的干燥环境，这是人类在便后清洁这件事上的大进步。\n但显然，并不是每个家庭中都有条件配备自动冲洗马桶，对于租房者来说，换装智能马桶盖的机会可能也没有。至于公共场所，就更难以寻得良厕。如此一来，想要呵护菊花、远离疾病，湿厕纸就成了方便快捷的不二之选。\n「菊花」带来的问题\n粪便是脏的，这是一个再浅显不过的常识。打小家长就教导我们，每次如厕之后都要擦干净，不然会生病。屁股擦不干净，粪便有残留，里面的细菌自然就容易滋生繁殖，进而引起疾病，甚至出现反复，比如胃肠道疾病，以及肛周疾病如肛周脓肿等。\n正常情况，人体排出的粪便中 1/3 到 2/3 的固体成分都是肠道菌群，这些是共生在我们的肠道中，辅助我们消化吸收的「益生菌」，比如乳酸菌、消化性球菌、消化链球菌等等。而当人体本身患有胃肠道疾病时，粪便中便可能携带有害的细菌，即致病菌、病原菌。\n粪便中常见的病原菌有引起痢疾的志贺菌属、引起食物中毒或败血症的沙门杆菌、也有致病性大肠杆菌、金黄色葡萄球菌等，都能引起程度不等的胃肠道疾病。早在 2001 年，美国亚利桑那大学的一项研究 发现，平均每条内裤含有 0.1 克的粪便，最高可达 10 克，而如果是一个感染了沙门杆菌的患者，这些残留在内裤的 0.1 克粪便，就可能含有 1 亿到 10 亿的沙门氏菌。致病性肠道细菌又往往通过粪口传播1，残留在粪便中的细菌，极可能会成为疾病传染的源头。\n因此，便后擦干净，不仅是为了我们自己的肛周安全，也是为了身边人的健康着想。\n但是在人类的进化史中，为了方便排便，肛周进化呈现为多褶皱的结构，「菊花」这个形象的代名词也是由此而来。这样褶皱多的菊花样结构也就决定了单纯的干纸擦拭，其实很难完全擦干净，且一旦用力过猛，很容易…",

          "description": "最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。\n但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。\n\n一、带宽进化的历史\n我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。\n56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。\n\n我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。\n后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。\n21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。\n\nADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。\n2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。\n\n从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。\n二、家庭的入户带宽\n现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。\n\n\n申请…",

          "description": "单纯品牌力的话，BBA中如果非要挑出一个“落伍”的，那就是奥迪。\n道理很简单，芯片短缺期间BBA三家先后涨价并限制资源，BB终端受到的影响并不大，但奥迪没坚持多久就开始放价了。虽然平时我们都认为BBA依然是同一线豪华品牌，并且奥迪部分车型更具技术和性价比，但很明显消费市场用实际情况告诉大家：如果都按指导价销售的话，原本想买奥迪的都去奔驰宝马了。\n回归正题，2021年影响奔驰C销售情况的主要因素就两个：\n\n资源短缺，当时新款预计9月上市的时候，老款6-7月份在很多店就已经断货了，新款上市后货量一直供应不足，直至2021年底车源情况才有所缓解；\n新款内外观变化较大，因为视觉差异明显且新C被媒体取了个“小S”的称呼，时间搁置越久，老款越不好卖，所以必须压制新款的吸引力而优先出清老款；\n\n\n资源短缺这个困难各个车企都存在，但也在细节上各不相同。单拿BBA来说的话，奔驰的资源告急时间节点是晚于宝马和奥迪的，但进入资源短缺状态之后，奔驰格外缺车，不像宝马那样虽然不够卖但陆陆续续也能到一些车。\n所以如果在那个时间段去逛一逛，会发现展厅最空的是奔驰，其次是宝马，而奥迪销售可能还会告诉你芯片短缺没什么大不了的过段时间就有车到了。\n\n上个月，也就是2022年1月份的时候，一些奔驰4S店还有少量老款奔驰C的库存（车型代码801），普遍优惠幅度在45000，这个价格就是普通人不找关系不走野路子在4S店多谈谈就能拿到的价格，而新款奔驰C（车型代码802）的优惠幅度只有12000-15000，不仅如此，因为新款配置有所增加和改变，所以指导价也是上调了的。\n这就回到了回答前两段碰瓷奥迪的问题——对于很多人来说，奥迪不是不好，而是超出了他们认可的定价区间，而奔驰也是故意拉大新老款的优惠幅度，使两代同款车型的落地价差距几乎能达到C级和A4L的差距，这样一来，自然是老款更好卖一些，但整体销量必然受损，道理很简单：不是所有人在感觉新款超预算的时候还会乐意去买老款，没准就出门左转去宝马看3系了。\n春节前我的老同学突然想给自己老婆换台车，问我C级和3系怎么选，我说你爱咋选咋选这个不要问我，看中哪款车我帮你去找关系要价就好了。结果这家伙奔着C级去却差点就买了CLA，眼看形势都有点控制不住了我就以他还没看宝马为由拉走了，到了宝马也略有离谱，看了两眼3系就站在5系旁边挪不动步了，随后惦记了好几天，想买5系，嘴上说还是给老婆买，其实内心已经是自己想开了。\n不过最终他结合家人意见和自己的喜好选了奔驰E，了解车源和行情的时候遇到了跟之前看C级一样的情况：4S店有现车，但交车欲望并不强烈。\n春节前常规进店客户，几乎就是统一口径没现车，需要订单排产，大概率节后提车。只有遇到极为难缠且利润大的客户单子，才会考虑放现车，除此以外，就是我们这种靠关系渠道而来的，不情不愿地给匀一台现车出来，这就是奔驰在春节前资源刚刚缓解时期的销售现状，卖车真不着急，利润优先。\n\n综合来看，不仅限于奔驰，在2021年很多品牌在车源紧张时期突然就尝到了之前梦寐以求的甜头：翻倍的利润，翻好几倍的利润。\n价格涨了之后，稀少的车源依然无法满足打了折扣的市场需求，所以在2021年也是少见的厂商双方都在内心窃喜的一年，以前经销商想保利润，厂家要求上量，而彼时却没有了这一层烦恼。\n所以即使要评估BBA中谁落伍，也不应该拿2021年尤其下半年的数据来分析，你永远不知道到底哪一家表面数据难看私底下却乐开了花。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n张凝澈\n点击下载\n46 个回答，查看全部。\n宝马三系，奥迪A4，奔驰c级，女新手纠结选择求建议！？\n宝马3系2019款和奔驰c哪个好？",

          "description": "今天，紫川动画第九集开播，猪期待已久的帝都流血夜剧情终于出来了。\n    帝都流血夜是紫川第一部的高潮，也是三兄弟性格展现、人性冲突的一场剧，三人今后的道路和命运都在这一夜被决定了，可以说是紫川第一部里最重要的戏份了。\n    因为故事激烈，猪当年是写得很舒畅的。感谢动画制作团队的用心，将这一幕剧情呈现得很符合猪心意，尤其是将总长参星的狠辣和阴险表现得很到位，将原作里一些遗漏和缺陷的情节也做了弥补，猪很是满意，中午和猪老婆一起美滋滋地看了动画，感觉甚是意得志满。\n     但孔圣人是怎么说的？天下唯女人难缠也！不学无术的猪老婆甚是可恶，看完以后居然大发厥辞，说动画很精彩，但原作写得太粗糙简单，破绽太多！\n这蠢婆娘专门抬杠，差点把猪给气死。\n猪婆娘蠢言论：“这场政变虎头蛇尾，这么简单就被平定了，杨明华是送死来的，他根本就一点胜算都没有，本就不应该发动这场叛乱的！”\n猪：错！在杨明华看来，他的优势很大！\n政变前，帝都的武装力量本来有三部分：中央军，是帝都最大也是最强的武装力量，足有十万兵马，军团长雷迅，是杨明华的亲信；禁卫军，约一万来人，负责总长府的保卫，是忠于总长的；另外还有负责城内秩序的总监察厅宪兵部队，人数也是数千人，是总监察长萧龙统带。至于其他的治部少治安警察在这里基本只有当观众的份了。\n本来，总长紫川参星一直就是靠禁军和监察厅的宪兵，才勉强和掌握中央军的杨明华维持了一个危险的弱势平衡，但政变之前，总监察长萧龙被杨明华拉拢了过去，帝都城内局势陡然失衡，何况杨明华还召来了帝林统带的远东边军呢？在政变前的杨明华看来，自己掌握了帝都城内、城外的三大部队，对付只有万把人的禁军，那简直是飞龙骑脸想输都难，他不动手还等什么？\n杨明华最大的错误，是没看破帝林是紫川参星安插的卧底，还让他统带了关键的远东边军进城，这导致了他最终的失败。\n猪婆娘：“杨明华兵力本身足够，还画蛇添足叫帝林带兵回来干什么？他让中央军直接攻打总长府不就得了？”\n猪：在雷迅统带下，中央军的政治立场是倾向于杨明华一方的，但他们毕竟也是紫川家的军官，要他们主动攻打紫川家的总长府跟禁军厮杀，同时还要背一个弑主的名声，大部分中央军军人是不会愿意的。\n因为中央军和禁军的士兵都是大多出身帝都本地人，大家本乡本土，搞不好沾亲带故的，都是亲戚街坊邻居朋友，干这种造反、沾血又坏名声的事，动员起来是很有难度的。剧情里，紫川秀能稳住中央军不参与叛乱，一个很大的原因就是中央军的军官团本来就有置身事外的强烈意愿。\n但是远东边军就不同了。边军跟帝都老百姓没交情，下得了狠手。在帝都干杀人放火的事他们是毫无压力的。在杨明华的原计划里，帝林带的远东军回来就是当刀子的，而帝都的中央军是用来压阵和事后收拾残局的，两支兵马互相制衡。没料到事与愿违，帝林这把刀子却是捅向了他自己。\n猪婆娘蠢言论：“既然杨明华优势很巨大，他为什么不趁早篡位，要拖那么久？”\n猪：杨明华在帝都城内确实占尽优势，但他一直不敢篡位，主要障碍倒不是总长府里的那万把禁卫军，而是另外两个原因。\n一是元老院。后面的三杰之乱里我们就看到，一个得不到元老会承认和支持的叛逆者，即使能攻下总长府杀了总长，他的处境也会非常艰难的。作为一个老谋深算的政治家，杨明华不能不考虑到后果。\n二是驻守各地的带兵统领，像哥应星、明辉、方劲等人。紫川参星虽然暗弱，但他毕竟还是紫川家明面上的主君，他被弑杀的消息传出去，统领们做出什么反应是难以预估的。所以，杨明华必须要准备好应付他们的暗手以后才能动手。\n也正是因为有着元老院和统领们的支持，紫川参星这个弱势总长才能对上强势的杨明华坚持那么多年。紫川参星和杨明华，他们二人之间有点像洪秀全和杨秀清，洪秀全拥有大势和名分，杨秀清则拥有实力上的优势。二人之间的斗争，谁赢都有可能，胜负也只是一线，不能说哪一方是压倒性优势或者毫无机会的。\n辨了一个中午，最后，杠精猪老婆哑口无言，猪大获全胜，鼻孔朝天。\n总之，对于这一集帝都流血夜，猪是很满意的~~感谢腾讯、铸梦工作室和万维猫动画的兄弟姐妹们，你们出色地复现了原作剧情，表达了猪的想法，让猪当年梦想的世界和故事得以活灵活现地呈现出来，与喜欢的读者们一同分享！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n老猪先生\n点击下载\n3 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价国产动画《紫川》首创隐藏互动剧集？\n《佣兵天下》可不可以做成系列动漫，对此，大家有什么看法？",

          "description": "大家好，我们是《师父》的开发团队Slocap，出于对中国功夫与中华文化的敬意与热爱，我们团队用心创作了《师父》这款游戏，真诚地希望你们能够喜欢！我们也将认真听取你们的反馈，尽最大努力改进游戏！ \n《师父》是一款以中国风作为设计主题、中国城市作为游戏背景、中国功夫白眉拳作为基础战斗风格的游戏。因此为了创造出一场真正具有沉浸感的中国功夫之旅，我们也潜行学习了中国功夫和中华文化，虽然掌握的可能只是九牛一毛，但依然希望能够给玩家带来令人印象深刻的记忆！ \n\n因此，在游戏《师父》中也有许多有趣的细节或是彩蛋—— \n1.不同于其他的时间循环与Roguelite机制，《师父》采用了一套独特的死亡与成长机制：当你在战斗中死去，你会再次复活，为此你付出的代价就是衰老。每一次死去，都会老去一点。玩家的初始年龄是20岁，经过多次倒下后，年龄最大上限为75岁左右（根据游玩方式来判定最大年龄），一旦超过这个界限，就将永久死亡。 \n2.不断死去，不断衰老——玩家在不同的年龄段会有不同的战斗特点，最直观的影响就是：年龄越大，生命值越低、攻击力越强。\n\n3.玩家扮演的功夫学徒腰间有一个五枚铜钱组成的坠饰，它代表了玩家拥有死而复生的能力，它会时刻挂在主角的腰间（玩家可以轻而易举地注意到，提醒自己余下的生命长度），当死亡次数达到一定的限度时，其中一枚铜钱便会崩裂，当五枚铜钱皆依次崩裂时，玩家将失去复生的能力，最后一次死亡将是永久的告别；类似的这些沉浸式UI还有很多，都是为了提醒玩家自己所处的年龄阶段，根据年龄来选择更有利的战斗方式。 \n4.《师父》具有极高的重玩性与耐玩度，你在另一个地图关卡中可能会寻找到有关于另一个地图关卡的线索——它或许可以帮助你打开一扇封闭的门，绕过一大群敌人来抄近路，更快地找到关卡BOSS。\n\n5.《师父》的动作指导是一位真正的白眉拳功夫大师：Benjamin Colussi——他曾经前往佛山，拜师于白眉拳大师刘伟新，学成之后回到法国开设了武馆，潜心钻研并传播中国功夫。 \n6.《师父》中玩家所处的武馆里，有一个供奉师父的牌位，游戏中的对联是完全复刻于白眉拳大师刘伟新与其弟子Benjamin Colussi武馆中的装潢。上联：学武学艺学仁义；下联：尊祖尊师尊武德；横批：武学之道。现实中牌位上供奉的宗师是：佛山白眉拳一代宗师刘少良；而游戏中将牌位上供奉的照片换为了主角的父亲。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n师父SIFU\n点击下载\n3 个回答，查看全部。\n你见过哪些有趣的游戏里的活动？\n游戏之间有过哪些有趣的联动？",

          "description": "KDE 团队宣布了 KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS 版，已经可以下载和安装了。如果你打算从以前的版本升级，在这里我们给你提供了从 5.23 升级到 5.24 的简明步骤。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.24 是 Plasma 桌面的第 26 个版本，带来了显著的视觉改变和一些后端性能的提升。在这个版本中，你会看到全新的墙纸、Breeze 主题的视觉变化、指纹登录和一个全新的概览屏幕等等。\n\r\n你可以在我们的综述文章里阅读有关 KDE Plasma 5.24 功能的细节。\n\r\n如果你正在运行 KDE Plasma 的早期版本，你可以按本文说明升级到最新版本。\n\r\n如何升级到 KDE Plasma 5.24\n\r\n这个版本的升级包大小适中，在我的测试机器上大约是 450MB 以上。在开始升级过程之前，请确保关闭所有应用程序并保存你的数据。\n\r\n一般来说，KDE 的升级是非常稳定的，它从来不会失败。但是，如果你想格外谨慎，并且有宝贵的数据，你可能想对这些进行备份。但同样，在我看来，我相信这是没有必要的。\n\r\n步骤\n\r\n如果你是在 KDE Neon 之中、滚动发布的发行版（如 Arch Linux、Manjaro 之类）中运行 KDE Plasma 5.23，你可以打开 KDE 工具 “发现Discover”，点击检查更新。\n\r\n你可以通过“发现Discover”的升级包列表验证 Plasma 5.24 是否可用。\n\r\n一旦确认可用，点击“发现Discover”窗口右上方的“全部更新Update All”按钮。\n\r\n另外，你也可以从终端运行下面的命令，在 KDE Neon 中开始升级过程。\n\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo pkcon update\r\n\n\r\n升级过程完成后重启系统。\n\r\n而重启后，你应该看到全新的 KDE Plasma 5.24 出现在你面前。\n\r\n在 Fedora 35 和 Ubuntu 21.10 中升级 KDE Plasma 5.24\n\r\n截至目前，Fedora 35 和 Ubuntu 21.10 是两个主要的 KDE 的发行版。由于 更新政策，Fedora 35 不会得到这个版本，而 Fedora 36 也将很快发布。 \n\r\n然而，如果你仍然想做实验，你可以在 Ubuntu 21.10 和 Ubuntu 21.04 中使用下面的 Backports PPA 安装这个新版本的 Plasma 桌面。在这样做的时候，请确保你保留一份数据备份。\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\r\nsudo apt-get full-upgrade\r\n\n\r\n在 Fedora 35 中，我试图通过下面的 COPR 仓库来安装。但是有太多的依赖性冲突需要解决，在一个稳定的系统中尝试这样做是有风险的。我建议目前不要在 Fedora 35 中尝试下面的方法。当然你仍然可以通过 allowerasing 标志来安装。但不要这样做。\n\r\n另外，我猜 Fedora 35 的官方版本会在第一个小版本（即 5.24.1）发布时更新，该版本将于 2022 年 2 月 15 日发布，所以你可以等到那时。\n\r\n另外，等待 Fedora 36 也是比较明智的做法，因为它将这个版本作为默认版本。Fedora 36 将于 2022 年 4 月发布。\n\r\n\n\r\nsudo dnf copr enable marcdeop/plasma\r\nsudo dnf copr enable marcdeop/kf5\r\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\r\n\n\r\n升级后的反馈\n\r\n我在虚拟机中运行了升级过程，并安装了新的 KDE Plasma 5.23。升级过程很顺利，没有出现意外或错误。好吧，到目前为止，它对我来说从未失败过。\n\r\n升级时间完全取决于你的互联网连接和 KDE 服务器。一般来说，它应该在 30 分钟内完成。\n\r\n升级过程后的第一次重启很顺利，没有花费多少时间。\n\r\n从性能上讲，我觉得它比之前的版本更流畅，这要归功于几个错误的修复和底层的性能优化。\n\r\n所以，总的来说，如果你在使用 KDE Neon，你可以安全地升级。否则就等待 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 稳定版的软件包。\n\r\n享受全新的 KDE Plasma 吧！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2022/02/upgrade-kde-plasma-5-24/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "对于那些涉足多款浏览器的人来说，Vivaldi 5.1 版本更新极富趣味，且更加实用。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nVivaldi 对于 Linux 用户来说是个不错的选择。他们将 Linux 平台作为其官方主力维护平台之一，这一点弥足珍贵。\n\r\n在 Vivaldi 5.0 版本 中，它已经成为许多 Linux 用户喜爱且极具功能性的 Chromium 内核浏览器之选。如今，Vivaldi 5.1 也终于问世！\n\r\n作为一款凭借强大的多任务管理功能而著名的浏览器，这一新版本想必是干货满满。\n\r\n接下来就一起深入探索吧！\n\r\nVivaldi 5.1 的新功能\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n还是提醒一下，Vivaldi 是一款几乎开源的浏览器，它的源代码是开放给所有用户的，但用户界面并不开源。\n\r\n和之前的 5.0 版本类似，该版本带来了一些关键性的改进，包括：\n\r\n\r\n可滚动的标签栏\n\r\n全新的在读清单\n\r\n新的开始页面快速设置面板\n\r\n\r\n可滚动的标签栏\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Vivaldi 5.1 中，你不必再沉没于狭窄而海量的标签之中。你可以直接滚动标签栏，无需缩小标签。\n\r\n考虑到大多数人喜欢把标签栏放到顶部或者底部，这一新功能可以让你直接通过滚轮或者箭头键来寻找标签。\n\r\n我敢相信，许多人听到这个功能能够与标签堆叠功能整合并进一步提高标签查找效率后，一定会很高兴的。是的，两级标签栏均可以使用标签滚动功能。\n\r\n这一新功能使 Vivaldi 的横向标签栏与垂直标签栏有了更高的一致性，后者已经支持滚动许久。\n\r\n在读列表\n\r\n\n\r\n当阅读新闻这件事开始成为日常事务之后，设置一个在读列表会很有用。在此之前，这一功能是靠浏览器拓展实现的，而如今它已被整合到浏览器当中，大幅增强了便利性和实用性。\n\r\n这一引入看上去更像是 Vivaldi 推动为其浏览器增添新服务功能的一大延续，不仅取代了一些常见拓展，更试图与 Firefox 的 Pocket 等同类平台进行竞争。\n\r\n你可以直接通过键盘快捷键和鼠标手势来访问相应页面，或添加页面到在读列表中。\n\r\n开始页面的快速设置\n\r\n\n\r\n开始页面一直都是网页浏览的关键节点，用户多年来也一直在定制它。不幸的是，用户往往要深入到设置页面去寻找自己需要的选项。\n\r\n如今，得益于 Vivaldi 新增的开始页面快速设置面板，这种情况将成为过去式。现在，所有与开始页面有关的选项都在同一位置，大幅改进了用户体验。\n\r\n你可以通过开始页面右上角的齿轮图标查看快速设置。\n\r\n其他变更\n\r\n除了上述改进之外，还有许多 bug 修复，以及针对翻译、邮件、日历和订阅阅读器功能的细节改进。\n\r\n你可以阅读 版本发布公告 来了解更多技术性改进。\n\r\nAndroid 版本同样也新增了一些新功能，包括修改标签宽度和选择更多强调色。你可以在这篇 博文 中了解详情。\n\r\n获取 Vivaldi 5.1\n\r\n如果这些新功能很合你的胃口，你可以前往 Vivaldi 官方网站下载 Vivaldi 5.1。如果你正在使用 Debian、Ubuntu 或者 Fedora，那么很简单，直接从 Vivaldi 官网下载相应软件包就可以了。\n\r\nVivaldi 同样也提供针对 ARM 架构的 32 位及 64 位软件包。\n\r\n\r\n下载 Vivaldi\n\r\n\r\n对于其他发行版，很不幸，你只能等待 Vivaldi 5.1 降临到发行版的相应仓库中，毕竟它可没有 Flatpak 和 Snap 版本。\n\r\n总的来说，我认为 Vivaldi 5.1 是一次巨大改进，足以让我迁移主力。\n\r\n你对 Vivaldi 5.1 的更新有什么看法吗？欢迎在评论区留言，让我了解你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/vivaldi-5-1-release/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lujun9972 译者：imgradeone 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "价值 36 亿美元的被盗比特币被追回\n\r\n美国司法部终于找到了在 2016 年加密货币交易所 Bitfinex 被黑期间被盗的几乎所有比特币，它们在一位音乐创作人和说唱歌手及其区块链创业公司创始人的丈夫手中。一个不确定身份的黑客将近 12 万枚比特币从交易所盗走转移到一个外部钱包，该钱包由上述夫妻控制，他们试图通过“迷宫般的加密货币交易”来 清洗被盗资金。在 2016 年这笔被盗的比特币总价值 7100 万美元。美国司法部扣押了仍在钱包中的近 95000 枚比特币，当前价值 36 亿美元。据悉，这些比特币将返还原持有者。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：就像历史上其它追回的被盗比特币一样，这相当于变相锁仓了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n默认使用双因素认证后用户信息泄漏情况减少一半\n\r\n2021 年 10 月，谷歌宣布计划为目前未使用双因素认证的 1.5 亿谷歌用户默认开启，并要求 200 万 YouTube 创作者使用该服务。谷歌最近说它观察到该测试用户群中账户被泄露的情况 减少了一半。2018 年，谷歌曾透露超过 90% 的活跃 Gmail 账户没有使用双因素认证，从那时起，谷歌在一直教育用户使用双因素认证。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：双因素认证就是安全和便利的最好折中。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n利用空闲的云计算来训练 AI\n\r\n大规模的数据中心和云计算服务商尽管拥有大量的实例，但是也经常会有空闲的处理能力。莱斯大学的一个团队和 ThirdAI 的 研究表明，即使在网络通信不畅和低带宽互连的情况下，近 10 亿个参数的大规模网络也可以在简单的 4 到 16 个核心的 CPU 节点上进行训练，其效果与一些最好的硬件加速器相当。秘诀在于利用他们开发的算法中的哈希稀疏性，该算法被称为 D-SLIDE，是对现有 SLIDE 算法的一种改造。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这种算法好，云服务商应该很欢迎。\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\n在 Meta 表示 可能撤出欧洲，德国和法国的部长表示没有 Facebook 也可以 之后，Meta 说“绝没有威胁”离开欧洲。",

          "description": "安装、配置和运行 HAProxy，在几个网络或应用服务器之间分配网络流量。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n不是只有在一个大型公司工作才需要使用负载平衡器。你可能是一个业余爱好者，用几台树莓派电脑自我托管一个网站。也许你是一个小企业的服务器管理员；也许你确实在一家大公司工作。无论你的情况如何，你都可以使用 HAProxy 负载平衡器来管理你的流量。\n\r\nHAProxy 被称为“世界上最快和使用最广泛的软件负载平衡器”。它包含了许多可以使你的应用程序更加安全可靠的功能，包括内置的速率限制、异常检测、连接排队、健康检查以及详细的日志和指标。学习本教程中所涉及的基本技能和概念，将有助于你使用 HAProxy 建立一个更强大的、远为强大的基础设施。\n\r\n为什么需要一个负载平衡器？\n\r\n负载平衡器是一种在几个网络或应用服务器之间轻松分配连接的方法。事实上，HAProxy 可以平衡任何类型的传输控制协议（TCP）流量，包括 RDP、FTP、WebSockets 或数据库连接。分散负载的能力意味着你不需要因为你的网站流量比谷歌大就购买一个拥有几十万 G 内存的大型网络服务器。\n\r\n负载平衡器还为你提供了灵活性。也许你现有的网络服务器不够强大，无法满足一年中繁忙时期的峰值需求，你想增加一个，但只是暂时的。也许你想增加一些冗余，以防一个服务器出现故障。有了 HAProxy，你可以在需要时向后端池添加更多的服务器，在不需要时删除它们。\n\r\n你还可以根据情况将请求路由到不同的服务器。例如，你可能想用几个缓存服务器（如 Varnish）来处理你的静态内容，但把任何需要动态内容的东西，如 API 端点，路由到一个更强大的机器。\n\r\n在这篇文章中，我将通过设置一个非常基本的 HAProxy 环境，使用 HTTPS 来监听安全端口 443，并利用几个后端 Web 服务器。它甚至会将所有进入预定义 URL（如 /api/）…",
