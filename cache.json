          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nWhile waiting for reviews in my recent pull request, I decided to find a different project. After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.\nA quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties' blogs about anything open-source. \nFor my task, I had to customize Telescope's build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:\nAdd header and side navigation bar\nChange side navigation default logo into Telescope logo\nUpdate link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Working on the issue\n\n\nAfter setting up the development environment using Telescope's documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.\nI began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn't break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. \nSince I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn't break or miss anything.\nSimilar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.\nCheers! 🍻",

It's overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.\nIn this series we're going to start with no authentication and then you'll add a very basic authentication system.

          "description": "Occasionally you might want to rename an AWS S3 bucket you are managing with Terraform. However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.\nTo avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.\nIn this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:\nresource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {\n    bucket = “old-name”\n}\n\nand you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.\nFirstly, we’ll need to create a new bucket.

A helpful CSS reset built on top of modern-normalize.\nMargins, headings, lists, and many others get stripped from their defaults. Thus, achieving cross-browser consistency and an easier adaptation of your design system.\nIt all sounds helpful, until you need those defaults to style a markdown post.\nIn comes @tailwindcss/typography, a plugin with sensible typographic styles. It adds a set of prose classes to style content blocks like the one you are reading.\nYou can install it via npm or yarn:\n# Using npm\nnpm install @tailwindcss/typography\n\n# Using Yarn\nyarn add @tailwindcss/typography\n\nThen add the plugin to your tailwind.config.js file:\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\n    // ...\n  ],\n}\n\nFinally, you can use the prose class to apply the markdown styling:\n<article class=\"prose lg:prose-xl\">\n  <h1>Welcome to Mars!</h1>\n  <p>\n    Although life on Mars is perfect in every single way, you might have some questions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Of course there’s air!

Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: \nIntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)\n\nTooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image)\n\nRight-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) \nYAML Syntax Validation \nHyperlinks for Docker Images \nIn our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!\nThere are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:\nMore tab completions\nDocker Compose schema validation \n… and much more! \nWe love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.",

I'm in the midst of the Ruby Path at The Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I've been working on building a game of Mastermind, which is easily the most complicated thing I've had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I'll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 \nSince this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I'm visiting my family back home. But other than that, I plan to keep on schedule barring some intense illness or emergency. Looking forward to expanding my skills and getting on a new career path 💯",

Only without JIRA, requirements, specifications, meetings, managers.  It's unashamedly nerdy - my premise is that programmers will enjoy the reward of cracking a team game in about an hour, especially if the subject matter is code, data or APIs.\nI'd love to hear from you in the comments.

These lessons seem to be very well structured, so I'm going to continue with this course until I complete it.\nToday I started the process of linting my entire project with ESLint (AirBnB rules). While the linting itself was not a problem, I ran into some serious dependency tree errors and really got lost in the forest of it. Solving these errors was a really long winded process and it ate up a lot of the time I had set aside for working. In the future, I will need to be much more careful when setting dependencies; I didn't realize how convoluted it could get to fix.\nAs is usual, Tuesday is my busiest day of the week and this Tuesday will be no exception. My plans are to continue with FreeCodeCamp's tutorials and any spare time I get to work on my project will be a blessing.\nDealing with dependencies in React. I need to learn more about the config files, especially package.json and the different ways I can go about solving dependency errors.

          "description": "做菜要用到的高温功能家电中，除了灶台、电磁炉等，烤箱现在也成了我家必不可少、几乎天天在使用的电器了，温度时间可调控、无油烟、是做烘焙的必需品，同时用烤箱来做菜的话，也兼有少油、省心、不易焦糊、不用频繁翻面的优势。不过和明火相比起来，烤箱菜的做法还是有些不同，也可以玩出更多花样，本篇文章列出了多道烤箱入门菜谱，蔬菜肉类甜品皆有涵盖，大概按照从易到难的顺序，不过总体来看都是比较简单的，希望对刚刚入手烤箱或是烤箱在家里搁置了很久也不知道怎么用的朋友们有所帮助。\n在菜谱内容正式展开之前，先列出烤箱制作中需要常备的物件们：\n\n一台烤箱；适配烤箱尺寸的烤盘、烤网；\n可直接放置食物的耐高温烤碗（烤碗不可以直接放在发热管上！一定要垫在烤盘烤网上）；油刷；\n烤纸（烤纸的作用是隔离开食物和碗盘起到不粘作用，否则像饼皮一类的在加热过程中会直接和碗底黏在一起，一抓就漏料。烤纸还能防脏，比如漏下去的蛋液在烤制时会在底部成焦疤状，有垫纸的话烤完直接把纸扔掉就行，否则刷渣子要刷好久）；\n食品夹；\n防烫手套。\n\n另外一些关于烤箱的重点 tips：\n\n每台烤箱的脾气都不太一样，有的温度会偏高或偏低，有的内壁炉温会高于靠近箱门的炉温所以可能会出现摆在里面的食物有点焦了摆靠外面的食物还没熟的情况，这些都需要大家在使用自家烤箱的过程中去熟悉，也建议大家把网上看到的菜谱中标示的温度和时间仅作为参考，根据实际情况进行调整。若还不清楚自家烤箱的温度情况，刚开始可以先在烤制中途蹲在旁边多盯盯，如果发现熟了甚至是有点焦了就提前取出，如果预设时间到了还没熟就再增加时长，或是备一根烤箱温度计。\n烤箱使用前都需要预热，建议提前 5–10 分钟先将烤箱调至需要的温度打开进行加热，下文中提到的烤箱使用时长都是预热后、菜品需要在烤箱里呆的时间，不再另外做提示啦，预热很重要很重要很重要，尤其是烘焙来说直接决定了成败，新手们一定记得先预热…",

          "description": "平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。\n首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。\n《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。\n其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。\n然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）\n1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。\n\n游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。\n2. 关于形状的错觉。\n\n一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。\n3. 颜色的错觉。\n\n\n这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）\n4. 负空间。\n\n在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。\n5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）\n\n虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。\n6. 倒影或平面变成实体\n\n挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。\n7. 透过遮罩的场景\n\n我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？\n8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方\n\n这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。\n游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。\n第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nmonokura\n点击下载\n53 个回答，查看全部。\n《纪念碑谷》里有哪些难以发现的细节？\n纪念碑谷为什么会火？",

          "description": "《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。\n番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。\n当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。\n至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。\n第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。\n第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。\n最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。\n以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nhaolin\n点击下载\n40 个回答，查看全部。\n动画《时光代理人》已经完结，如何评价这部作品？\n谁是动画史上最糟糕的角色？为什么？",

          "description": "两不疑第一季完结在即，也借此机会对项目做个简单的总结梳理，在动画创作、制作上跟大家一起交流下。\n两不疑动画项目从最早的PV开发也就是最早放出的一分半完整版pv短片，到正剧制作流程开发，正剧制作，上线，每周一集供应，周更一直到第一季完结。前后近两年时间，每个阶段都面临不同的困难和问题，而这两年也是纸飞机动画作为传统3D动画团队从开始接触三渲二到研发自己的三渲二视效建立三渲二制作流程的过程。\n回想两年前第一次跟IP方漫漫漫画一起探讨两不疑的动画改编时，第一个面对的问题就是两不疑动画的视效风格是选择3D还是三渲二。\n传统3D视效风格纸飞机本身制作流程成熟，在制作和预算控制上更有把握，而三渲二更适合还原漫画画风，可以给观众带来更贴合原著的体验感，但面临在预算有限的情况下还要从头摸索制作方案和视效风格的问题。\n当时双方一拍即合，三渲二！不论是画风、故事、角色塑造以优先还原原著为第一位。\n\n两不疑如果要做动画就要给漫画粉丝呈现一个她们期待中的两不疑动画。预算不足的问题通过延长PV开发周期来解决，给制作组一个较长时间来研究和适应新风格，利用其他项目的间歇来解决三渲二技术开发并完成PV制作。\n最终1分30秒的PV用了9个月的时间制作完成，通过PV开发制作组熟悉了三渲二的制作方案也对两不疑的画风建立了了解。\n\n徐钰美术设定\n\n徐钰角色资产lookdev\n\n国师面部阴影开发\n随着pv上线，两不疑正剧的前期工作也正式展开，在我个人的经验中长篇动画的创作生产与短片、CG有着本质的区别。一部能达到及格线的长篇动画首先考验的是各个核心主创环节的专业性和配合度，确立分工配合！\n由B站的监制老师把控整体方向，IP方漫漫漫画负责整体项目制片，两不疑漫画编辑以及原作者负责剧本原著方向把控，避免人物ooc，提供剧本修改的解决方案，纸飞机负责导演和执行制片及全片制作。\n呼，松了口气，终于不用担心我一个直男导演一不小心把两不疑改成少年热血番了。\n\nOk!原著漫画有好的故事基础，人物塑造到位，又有原作者帮忙把控原著方向，不用担心跑偏。那剩下的就是导演技术型工作了。\n如何将原著较为片段化的桥段和情节串联起来，如何把原著的故事讲的更有趣更有悬念，如何让观众更好的代入故事和了解认同角色，是否有原著中被省略或可以扩展的情节能提出来做点小原创发挥玩一下，可以说整个改编的工作更像是导演基础技巧训练。\n正剧前期工作推进的同时，针对两不疑剧集的三渲二流程也同步在研发中。与PV短片的制作流程不同，在短片中更关注如何实现三渲二的最终画面效果，角色、场景资产的制作会根据镜头的需要来规划和实现效果。到了剧集首先要解决大规模生产协作和制作成本优化问题，所有制作方案和效果必须建立统一的制作规则和尽量实现全流程的工具化操作。\n\n\n\n由于整个项目本身预算不高，为了在有限的预算和档期内尽量达到最佳效果，两不疑项目的整个制作过程中一直在镜头设计、制作方案和最终效果上寻找平衡点。在镜头设计上减少非必要的与故事表达无关的运动镜头，尽量使用固定机位镜头来进行叙事，一些常规的镜头运动采取2D动画的后期运镜方式，把更多的设计精力和预算放在构图把控和镜头节奏剪辑上。\n\n在动画上，项目早期也测试过动作捕捉方案，动作捕捉对剧集动画有着生产速度更快，生产周期更好把控的优势。但写实的动画风格跟两不疑不搭，而两不疑里的文戏、情感戏占比较多，对动画表演的准确度和关键表演细腻程度要求很高，最终为了更好的呈现两不疑的风格还是选择了全片使用传统手key动画。\n\n超过240分钟手工动画带来的问题就是，需要寻找大量外包合作的动画团队和动画师一起协作参与制作。如何控制动画成本？如何让各个团队统一动画表演风格？如何应对参差不齐的动画质量和海量的动画反馈？\n解决的关键在layout！\n在3Dlayout 环节导演要确定所有创作和角色关键表演信息，避免在大规模制作生产环节进行创作和修改。为了做到这一点两不疑的3Dlayout全部由纸飞机内部的动画师和有多个项目配合经验的合作方完成，在这个阶段进行大量互动沟通和反馈来确定镜头构图及表演创作，同时也参考了传统2D动画的故事板和原画流程，用尽量少的关键帧来确定镜头构图和角色的表演。\n\n\n虽然关键帧较少，但每个关键帧从角色POSE到表演状态上都达到最终的动画表演级别，用少量关键帧卡准表演的关键节奏点。这样来避免在进入正式的动画的生产环节因设计不确定而产生的大量重复性修改及损耗，也便于控制整个动画中期的质量和统一风格。\n\n以上是两不疑项目中我个人感觉一定有代表性的经验和问题，简单的整理下分享给大家，也欢迎对两不疑和三渲二感兴趣的朋友一起多多交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n王丰彬\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价电视剧《两不疑》?\n如何评价漫画《两不疑》？",

          "description": "谢邀\n我从以下四个方面解答这个问题：\n\n1、香型的由来\n2、香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌\n3、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n4、香型如此多，我们怎么选？\n\n一、香型的由来：\n酒自诞生开始，就有香味的区别，不同地域、不同技艺，形成了各自的代表酒。但在1979年以前，中国白酒是不分香型，统称为蒸馏酒。\n香型正式区分，是1979年在大连召开的全国名优白酒协作会议及第三届全国评酒会上提出的，在第三届大会的时候分别从气味、成分、微生物、酿造工艺等方面综合评价：确认了5类香型：清香、浓香、酱香、米香、其他香型（不属于其他香型的统统归在这）。\n随后，经过进一步研究，扩展为12种香型：\n清香型、浓香型、酱香型、米香型、兼香型、药香型、凤香型、特香型、芝麻香型、老白干、馥郁香和豉香型。\n\n二、各个香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌。\n香型的名称应该反映出本香型产品的个性和内涵，但是香型的划分并不统一：\n有的按照香味的浓烈程度来判断：比如浓香型，判断标准是酒体中的窖香突出。\n有的根据香味所体现的口感特征来判断：比如酱香型，判断标准酱香、焦香、糊香的复合香气。\n还有以产品名称来划分：比如凤香型、老白干香型，特香型。\n为了统一标准，要求必须在每个香型后面加入其工艺、风味特征的描述，于是有了下图：\n\n三、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n为什么中国的白酒香型如此之多？\n总的来说分为以下原因：\n1、历史原因：\n中国多次民族分裂和民族融合，使我国成为多民族文化共存的国家，各民族的地理环境、风俗习惯，饮食习惯的差异，各地人口味千差万别，形成了“食有千种，味有千样”的华夏饮食体系，由此体系衍生出来的白酒，就变成多种香型共存的口感需求。\n2、技术发展：\n由于生产工艺的创新发展，酿造原料的多样性，各个区域形成了特色、风格不同的各种香型的白酒，加上地理环境的差异性，导致不同区域的酒曲、窖泥、酒醅和地域环境，都对微生物有不同的影响，从而影响到发酵的速度，香味，口感等。\n四、面对种类如此多的香型，我们应该怎么选择？\n（1）如果你之前没有喝过白酒，但是最近想开始试着接触白酒，那我建议你可以从清香、米香开始，这两个香型，口感比较淡，入口绵顺柔和，舒适度高，刺激性较弱，有利于给初次接触的人，留下一个好印象。\n我推荐汾酒和三花两个品牌的中端酒，这样能提升白酒的好感度、趣味性和持续性。\n比如这款老白汾15：\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/9ce8fdbdc0133fa79cfe34337ead254c?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n（2）如果你已经接触了一段时间白酒了，那我推荐你看看各知名品牌，在这我也推荐几款虽然名气比不上一线，但是酒质和性价比绝对划算的品牌，这几款酒一定可以让你惊艳。\n酱香：年份潭酒、金质、丹泉。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/c0015374386b79f17e3795fecfe84c87?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n浓香：丰谷、五粮春、泸特、金剑南\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/df5d7945012c7e7275e1e56ca47ef7b9?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：口子窖\n（3）如果你是老酒鬼，那就看看下面这些公认的性价比高的口粮酒吧。\n清香：汾酒、红星、牛栏山。\n浓香：双沟圣坊、文君、今世缘（单开、对开）、丰谷酒王10。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/8116e263867e34fc8715090921f95010?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n酱香：金质、金酱、武陵少酱、金沙回星。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/4d01d2a2702995759d67b86e17cc24bf?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：白云边15年、口子窖6年。\n特香：东方弘韵。\n食有千种，味有千样，喝酒重要的不是香型，而是喝酒气氛、讲出来的故事、带动的情绪，饮酒之趣，在于不同时间、不同环境，喝酒体验大相径庭。\n如果你觉得文章让你进一步了解白酒的香型，请点个赞再走吧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知酒浓\n点击下载\n256 个回答，查看全部。\n有哪些 酱香型、浓香型、清香型、兼香型白酒适合做口粮的？\n酱香型、清香型、浓香型等白酒究竟有哪些区别？",

          "description": "首先丰收的是秋粮，那么\n全国秋粮作物主要包括哪些？\n朱娟（农业农村部种植业管理司农情信息处处长）：秋粮作物主要是玉米、中晚稻、还有大豆，另外还有一些春小麦和杂粮、杂豆，这里面的玉米大概占了52%左右，中晚稻占了37%，大豆占了4%，\n大家很关心一个问题，夏粮和早稻都丰收了，但是我们知道像河南等地遭遇了暴雨洪涝灾害的影响，那么这种灾情对全国的秋粮生产（影响）有多大？\n自然灾害对秋粮影响有多大\n朱娟：确实正如您所说，今年极端天气比较多，局部像河南灾情确实比较重，但是整个全国面上的灾情总体偏轻。这里有两组数据，我给大家介绍一下，一个是重灾区的面积占秋粮（总面积）的整体比例是比较小的，今年受灾比较重的主要是集中在两个区域，一个是河南受涝，另外一个就是西北受旱，那河南大家也知道，“7·20”极端暴雨洪涝灾害，造成河南农作物受灾是一千五百多万亩，其中秋粮是一千一百多万亩，占到河南秋粮面积的14%左右，但是从全国来看，它仅占全国秋粮面积的1%左右。\n所以这个大家一定要清楚，大家一想河南它是粮食生产大省，但其实从秋粮这个角度来看，它的占比在全国的占比并不高。\n朱娟：而且河南的秋粮，还有六千五百多万亩没有受灾的秋粮，这部分作物长势不错，可以做到以丰补歉。另一块区域就是西北的受旱区域，西北陕西、甘肃、宁夏今年旱情比较重，受旱面积最大的时候达到了一千九百多万亩，这个占到全国秋粮面积大概1.5%左右，但是这里面因为它西北杂粮、杂豆的占比比较高，所以它是属于这种低产作物，对整个全国秋粮产量的影响也是很有限的。\n那么除去这些受灾的地区，其他的整体上来看，没有受灾的地区秋粮长势怎么样？\n朱娟：在秋粮生长发育期内大部分地区，光、温、水匹配比较好，就没有发生这种流域性的、区域性的、大范围的旱涝灾害，从我们调度的情况，6月以来，就是秋粮的主要生长发育期内，是近十年同期受灾是最轻的一年，特别是东北地区，今年雨水多，旱情非常轻，也没有发生像去年秋收前这种连续三个台风的袭击，所以东北今年是个大丰收年。\n从敏芳那边的自己种植的情况来看，你们今年的水稻种植的过程当中，有没有遇到一些灾害性天气的影响？因为湖南也是水稻种植大省。\n董敏芳：其实我们在种植过程当中，今年的早稻倒是碰上了“倒春寒”，但是通过我们的科学化种植，科技兴农我们采用的旱地育秧，有效地保障了秧苗的品质，我们是有效地防范了“倒春寒”的影响，所以对于我们的产量来讲没有造成影响。\n今年秋粮丰收不容易\n朱娟：今年秋粮克服了局部极端的洪涝、干旱以及病虫害重发等等不利因素，再获丰收非常不容易，今年秋粮面积，在去年已经增加了八百七十多万亩的基础上，今年进一步增加达到12.9亿亩以上。这是奠定了丰收的基础。今年国家继续实施稻谷、小麦最低收购价政策，而且把最低收购价提高了一分钱，此外扩大了玉米、大豆生产者补贴的资金的规模，还首次安排一次性实际种粮农民补贴资金总额达到200亿元，直接支持粮食生产的扶持政策，资金规模也进一步扩大，我们统计了一下，是增加了六十多亿元。农业农村部在关键农时派出了二十多个专家组和工作组，赴主产省指导生产。\n在河南洪涝灾情发生后，中央财政安排专项资金，支持农业抗灾救灾。农业农村部第一时间组织专业力量指导抗灾救灾。调用两千多台抽水泵、组织5.8万农机手帮助重灾区抽排田间积水。派出22个专家小分队带物资、带技术，蹲点指导灾后改种补种。协调周边省份，捐赠救灾种子等农资，满足灾后改种补种的需要。绝收的五百多万亩秋粮，有一半进行了改种补种，挽回了部分损失。\n在秋粮收获时，黄淮海地区遭遇极端天气影响，特别是山西陕西等地洪涝灾情严重。农业农村部立即组织专家组，指导当地抢收抢种。黄淮海地区的秋粮作物主要是玉米，据农情调度，截至目前，山西秋粮收获进度2/3左右。陕西秋粮收获进度3/4以上。两省反映，“十一”强降雨发生的时候，两省秋粮产量已基本形成，灾害对产量影响是有限的。农业农村部宣布，今年秋粮增产已成定局，秋粮面积稳中有增，目前收获已近8成。近期的连阴雨对产量影响总体有限，全年粮食产量将再创历史新高，连续7年保持在1.3万亿斤以上。\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国三农发布\n点击下载\n109 个回答，查看全部。\n我们中国的粮食真的是年年增长吗？\n国家粮食储备库是干嘛的呢？",

          "description": "大家好，我是震雷的孙猛，此次《识夜描银》改编动画的导演。\n我是在2018年末开始思考《识夜描银》的动画改编工作的。我的第一件工作，就是作为系列构成，去寻找这个故事到底要讲什么。\n作为文学影视作品，不单单的讲流水线式的剧情，而是深度发掘其内在的精神内核，将其想表达的东西传达给观众，引起观众思考，反思，回味，是本次改编的重点意义所在。\n为此我与原作进行了很多交流，也得到了很多来自作者的创作资料，从而更好，更全面的了解了故事的全貌和内核。\n\n\n“这个世界所有的力量，源自于信仰。\n这句话可以说，是本作最核心的原则，心存善念，就会带来吉祥，心存恶念，就会招致毁灭。\n看似唯心主义的东西，其实是体现了非常传统的东方思想，原作者在《识夜描银世界规律》一文中写道，”规律孕育万物，从草木变成人，有了众生，众生对大自然有了敬畏，产生了信仰，信仰缔造了神明，赋予了神明神权“，这是非常传统的老子道家思想的演化，非常中国味，同时也充满了哲理。这也是本作最打动我的地方。原作漫画里这一点表现的比较隐晦，所以在动画的改编过程中，这一点将作为中心思想，贯穿始终。\n在这一点的基础上引申下去的话，也可以引出很多方面的反思，神明是人造的，人们又回过头去崇拜那个神明，将权利交付与他们，甘心受其统治，谁也没见过上天，但自我塑造出了天子，并将全部权利交付于他统治自己。不过太过深入的话，我觉得可能会跑偏到民主政治和独裁政治的讨论上去，那样的话也许会给本作招来不必要的麻烦，要不就算了吧（笑）。\n\n\n在世界观上，本作和一般的武侠，玄幻类作品相比，也有着一个非常重大区别，那就是对于所谓的“鬼”这个概念的阐述。在绝大部分的此类作品，在这一点上都没有能够突破传统，而本作在这一点上，有着非常有深刻意义的设定，那就是这世界上没有鬼，而人是有灵魂的，人的灵魂分成三份，天魂，地魂，人魂。人死之后，天魂归天，地魂入地，人魂消散，归于虚无。这一…",

          "description": "现在非法使用军服仿制品的行为不少。大街小巷，非军人穿着迷彩服的现象几乎每天都能看到，这是很不严肃的。尤其是工地上，非军人穿迷彩服的可能更多，尽管没有配上军衔和军种符号，但非常碍眼。到了冬天，迷彩军大衣又成为非军人比较喜欢穿的衣服。\n对于军服的日常管理，早在2009年，国务院就发布第547号令，出台《军服管理条例》，自2009年3月1日起施行，全文共20条。\n其中第九至十八条规定如下：\n第九条  现役军人以及依照法律、法规和军队有关规定可以穿着军服的人员，应当依照有关规定穿着军服。军队警备执勤人员应当加强检查、纠察，及时纠正违法穿着军服的行为。影视制作和文艺演出单位的演艺人员因扮演军人角色需要穿着军服的，应当遵守军队关于军服穿着的规定，不得损害军队和军人形象。非拍摄、演出时不得穿着军服。\n第十条  禁止买卖、出租或者擅自出借、赠送军服。禁止使用军服和中国人民解放军曾经装备的制式服装从事经营活动。禁止以“军需”、“军服”、“军品”等用语招揽顾客。\n第十一条  机关、团体、企业事业单位和其他组织的制式服装及其标志服饰，应当与军服有明显区别。禁止生产、销售、购买和使用仿照军服样式、颜色制作的足以使公众视为军服的仿制品。\n第十二条  违反本条例规定，有下列情形之一的，由工商行政管理部门没收违法物品和违法所得，处1万元以上10万元以下的罚款；违法经营数额巨大的，吊销营业执照；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任：（一）非法生产军服、军服专用材料的；（二）买卖军服、军服专用材料的；（三）生产、销售军服仿制品的。工商行政管理部门发现涉嫌非法生产、销售军服或者军服仿制品的行为时，可以查封、扣押涉嫌物品。\n第十三条  军服承制企业违反本条例规定，有下列情形之一的，由工商行政管理部门责令改正，处1万元以上5万元以下的罚款；拒不改正的，责令停业整顿：（一）转让军服、军服专用材料生产合同或者生产技术规范，或者委托其他企业生产军服、军服专用材料的；（二）销售或者以其他方式转让未经改制、染色等处理的军服、军服专用材料残次品的；（三）未将军服生产中剩余的军服专用材料妥善保管、移交的。具有前款规定情形之一的，军队军需主管部门应当将其从军服承制企业备选名录中除名，并不得再列入军服承制企业备选名录。\n第十四条 军服承制企业的工作人员泄露军服专用材料生产技术，或者军服承制、承运企业的工作人员泄露军服、军服专用材料生产、运输数量以及接收单位等涉及国家秘密的信息，构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n第十五条 违反本条例规定，使用军服和中国人民解放军曾经装备的制式服装从事经营活动，或者以“军需”、“军服”、“军品”等用语招揽顾客的，由工商行政管理部门责令改正，没收违法物品和违法所得，并处2000元以上2万元以下的罚款；拒不改正的，责令停业整顿。\n第十六条 穿着军服或者军服仿制品冒充军人招摇撞骗的，由公安机关依法给予治安管理处罚；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n第十七条 公务员和现役军人在军服管理工作中滥用职权、玩忽职守、徇私舞弊的，依法给予处分；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。现役军人出租或者擅自出借、赠送军服的，依照《中国人民解放军纪律条令》的规定给予处分。\n第十八条 对公安机关、工商行政管理部门查获的军服仿制品的认定存在争议的，由省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门鉴定。公安机关、工商行政管理部门依法没收的军服、军服专用材料，应当移交省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门；依法没收的军服仿制品，应当按照国家有关规定处理。\n由此可见，非军人着军服，是有严格限定的，影视演员在拍摄相关作品时，可以穿相应的军服，但非拍摄时，不能着军服。\n所以在守护戎装上，一是要加强《军服管理条例》的宣传普及，让人民群众知道军服到底能不能穿，非军人穿着军服会有什么后果。二是对军服承制企业，要加强督查和严格约束，除了向军队供货，不得将承制的军服或仿制军服向地方销售。三是对经营户，省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门、公安机关、工商行政管理部门要加大执法力度，对售卖军服的经营户，及时处罚和制止。四是军人也要严格要求自己，穿旧的军服，要按规定处理，不要给家人或亲友穿。五是退役军人着军服，也要按照规定和时机执行，不能像在军营一样穿着军服。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n东部战区\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n军服上那些花花绿绿的块块是有什么特殊含义吗？\n怎么看美国陆军将换新军装，改回二战时期“粉绿”军服？",

          "description": "一场激烈的战役正进行到最紧张的时刻。遮天蔽日的炮火下，敌我双方死伤相枕，战场上僵持不下。谁能想到，有一个小小的苹果居然会被战史所记录。\n这是1952年秋季上甘岭战役中的一幕。  \n\n战役打响前，美军第8集团军司令范弗里特狂妄至极，打算以牺牲200人左右的代价，在5天之内轻松拿下上甘岭地区的597.9高地和537.7高地。实际上，范弗里特确实有“自信”的资本，他们有足够的弹药保障和航空支援，这在战场上占绝对优势。\n彼时，“联合国军”将300余门大炮直接拉到了阵地之下，万弹齐发，地动山摇。另外他们还有大量的坦克和飞机支援，战场炮火的密度创历史空前。据记载，面积仅为3.7平方公里的上甘岭地区每秒就要承受敌军6发炮弹，每平方米落弹76枚，这在人类战争史上是极为罕见的。整个上甘岭阵地烈焰如海、硝烟缭绕。面对敌人如此高强度的狂轰滥炸，我军当然伤亡惨重。一时取得胜利的“联合国军”觉得战斗马上就可以结束，可他们万万没想到，好几个星期过去了，志愿军还是无法撼动。\n\n是什么保存了有生力量？\n在武器装备上明显处于劣势的志愿军，创造性地将坑道作业发挥到极致，有效地削弱了敌人空炮火力的杀伤效果。面对敌人一次次的疯狂进攻，英勇顽强的志愿军没有畏惧，一次次将其打退。可更要命的问题接踵而至：坑道里的志愿军们不得不时常面临缺水缺粮缺弹药的残酷境遇，补给是个大难题。\n\n要知道现代战争是立体战争，战争不仅在前方打，也在后方打。后方的战争，不仅决定了前方战争的规模，而且也会关乎前方战争的成败。“联合国军”当然深谙这一点，他们一方面对志愿军疯狂进攻，一方面用绵密的炮火切断了志愿军在上甘岭阵地的所有后勤补给线。\n前方需要什么，后勤就运输什么。为了保障好前线官兵，时任15军军长的秦基伟下令要不惜一切代价向坑道运送物资。就这样，火线运输员一批接着一批，冒着敌人的炮火，前仆后继地穿梭于通往坑道的路上。可即便如此，能够运送到…",

          "description": "美国《国家利益》杂志曾经推出过这样一份“世界十大狙击手”排行的榜单，在这份榜单之中美国却破天荒的将一个中国人排在第八位，他叫做张桃芳。\n或许很多人对他非常陌生，然而对于很多参加过朝鲜战争尤其是参加过“上甘岭战役”的美国老兵来说，他们绝对不愿意提及这个名字，因为这个名字简直就是他们的噩梦。\n在当年的上甘岭战场，这个年仅23岁的精神小伙用436发子弹干掉了214个敌人约等于两个连，他自己却毫发无损。\n中国有句老话叫做“百万军中取人首级如探囊取物”，这句话用在张桃芳身上实在是在合适不过了，也因为对张桃芳的恐惧，当年的美军士兵在上甘岭甚至不敢露头夜间不敢上厕所。\n那么这位上甘岭狙神究竟有多传奇的人生呢？今天我们就来聊聊这位令美国人胆寒的上甘岭狙神：\n神枪手是怎样练成的？令人胆寒的上甘岭狙神曾是个三次脱靶的“菜鸟”\n在第五次战役之后，无论是中国人民志愿军还是美军都意识到想要战胜对方确实是一件不容易的事情，因此在这之后志愿军和美军就进入了“边打边谈”的奇怪模式之中。\n当时无论是志愿军还是联合国军的重心主要是谈判，可是有句老话说得好：“战场上得不到的，谈判桌上也休想得到。”\n因此志愿军和美军在谈判的同时也在暗暗较劲，美军先后对志愿军发动“绞杀战”、“细菌战”想逼迫志愿军屈服，这些先后都被志愿军破解。\n看着“绞杀战”不成，美军又想凭借强大的火力逼迫志愿军屈服，于是在1952年10月爆发了“上甘岭战役”，在经过43个昼夜的激战，无论是美军还是志愿军都付出了巨大的伤亡，美军看着无法靠着强大的火力攻势在谈判桌上获得筹码因此只能继续在板门店继续进行谈判。\n当时双方谁也不想先挑起战役，破坏停战谈判的气氛，可是为了争取谈判桌上的主动权，战场上必须也要占据主动，因此主席在这之后就提出了：\n用“零敲牛皮糖”的战略消灭敌人，灵活出击，有利就打，于是一场针对美军的“冷枪冷炮运动”就此开始了。\n张桃芳就凭借这场…",

          "description": "中国文艺网时评丨从艺先做人是文艺工作者的终身必修课\n\n\n近日，钢琴家李云迪因涉嫌嫖娼被北京朝阳警方依法行政拘留，曾经享誉国际的“钢琴王子”如今踩踏了道德底线与法律红线，其行径遭到了社会和大众的一致谴责，同时引起了行业深思。大众谴责的不仅是身为“明星”的李云迪行为失范，更是身为“艺术家”的李云迪德不配位。文艺工作者可以“跨界”但不能“越线”。作为当红的顶流文艺工作者，相较于娱乐明星拥有更高的公共权威，艺术家的价值观念、审美情趣对受众的影响更为深远。“从艺先做人”、重“修心”早已是艺术家的必修之功课、终身之功课，也是艺术之所以成为艺术、启迪心灵的内在动力。人们常常将艺术家的技艺与品德相联系，艺术家一旦有不良行为，对受众主流价值观的解构程度，以及社会良好风气的破坏程度十分巨大。\n“艺术家”“天才少年”“钢琴王子”李云迪跌落神坛，令人分外扼腕，冷静分析德不配位的深层原因，与其以身体的“欲望”取代精神的“愉悦”，以名利的追逐取代人格的修养，以华丽人设取代“道器”的修持，以本能的放纵取代理性的克制有很大关系。李云迪少年成名，年仅18岁时便已获得第14届肖邦国际钢琴比赛冠军，次年便登上央视春晚舞台，成为家喻户晓的钢琴艺术家，近年来，李云迪更是频频“跨界”成为了综艺节目的常客。但李云迪的专业水准并未随着名气的增长而精进，相反，李云迪的演奏状态持续下降，在公开演奏会中失误频频，“钢琴家”的头衔似乎成为其娱乐明星身份的精美“人设”。艺术家“跨界”无可厚非，但流量应与技艺相匹配，名气应与品德旗鼓相当，秉承艺术家的身份却一味沉湎于追逐热钱，不仅是对个人精神的蚕食，同时也是对文艺工作者群体公信力的消减；而其跨越法律与道德红线的嫖娼行为，不仅是对社会核心价值观的一种亵渎，更是对公序良俗的一种践踏。\n李云迪事件的警示意义远远超出其自身，对于文艺工作者的规范必须各方联合发力。首先，文艺工作者自身要汲取教训、引以为戒，真正做到德才兼备、才高行洁，耐得住文艺工作“高处不胜寒”的寂寞。因为文艺工作者的言行直接影响着大众价值观与审美情趣的塑造，特别是在网络媒介生态下，文艺工作者的言行举止都将被媒介放大，严以修身、知行合一和引领示范是广大文艺工作者安身立命的必修课。其次，规范各文化企业和社交平台对明星艺人的曝光范围，要划定和提升曝光门槛，逐步建立专业与道德“档案”，专注宣传专业精深、德艺双馨的文艺工作者。对于以“艺术家”头衔博眼球、赚快钱而放松其道德品质与专业修养的明星艺人，我们不能为其慷慨提供舞台和平台，不能为了市场飘红而放弃立场底线，对于一手赚钱一手推墙者必须予以严惩和打击，守护好文艺界的正气清风，才是文化产业良性循环的正道。第三，各级文联协会要履行职能，发挥引导作用，加大培训力度，加强行业风气监管，既要敢于亮剑作为，也要善于引导示范，努力营造积极健康的文艺生态。总之，只有不断加强法纪教育和法律文化普及，提升道德修为与审美修养，文艺工作者才能让自己具备引领时代风尚的资格与能力。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国文艺网\n点击下载\n10 个回答，查看全部。\n中国音乐家协会钢琴考级可以弹中央音乐学院的曲子么？\n作为一个天津音乐学院钢琴系的学生，想要做钢琴家教，如何能找到人脉介绍学生？",

          "description": "theme: smartblue\n今天中国谷歌开发者大会线上如期举行，其中主要包含了 Android 、TF、Play、AR、Flutter 等相关的内容，本篇主要介绍主会场的部分内容。\n本次大会看起来基本都是录播的感觉，我比较关心 Android 和 Flutter 的内容。\nAndroid\nAndroid 12 的发布主要在如下三方面进行了优化调整：用户界面、性能、隐私。\n\n关于用户界面谷歌提供了 Material You 的设计，可以说是  Material Design 的 V3 模式。\n从我个人看，这个对我们国内影响不大，毕竟大部分 App 都不遵循这个设计规范····\n\nAndroid 12 同时更注重多种设备屏幕的适配，比如 WPS 就兼容了折叠屏的工作模式。\n\n关于 MAD 相信大家也不陌生，Modern Android Development，谷歌开发者公众号今年就推送了一些列的 MAD Skills 的文章，其中就包含 Jetpack 常见的 Navigatoin、WorkManager、Room、DataStore、Macrobenchmark 等等的内容。\n\n还有针对 Andorid Wear 的介绍和合作品牌介绍。\n\nPlay\nGoogle Play 这次最主要是介绍了 Data safety section 相关，也是后续上架会慢慢开始强制性要求的内容。\n\n我在《对开发者而言《个人信息保护法》更新究竟是什么？如何应对适配？》就有对这部分内容进行过介绍。\n\nAR\n更方便的和更强大的 ARCore SDK，可以更便捷地调用，不出意外蹭了一波元宇宙的热度。\n\n\nTensorFlow\n举例国内外使用 TensorFlow 的例子：\n知衣 App 使用它让用户可以在线上使用衣服\n58同城使用它做车牌识别和车型等。\n\nWeb\n更加注重隐私权限的沙盒。\n\n介绍 WebAssembly 能更好接入 C++ 代码，让渲染更加流畅和优秀。\n\n\nPWA 可以更方便同步用户的操作，比如打开文件。\n\n\nFlutter\n官方介绍 Flutter 已经成为了最大的跨平台开发框架，谷歌 Play 上超过 350,000  App 使用 Flutter 。\n\n例如字节跳动就是最大的 Flutter 应用开发商之一，它名下就有 >70 款 app 使用了 Flutter 开发。\n\n腾讯不只在微信和企业微信手机端使用了 Flutter ，在 PC 端也开始使用 Flutter 支持，甚至在游戏领域。\n\n\n官方接收的反馈， Flutter 提高了 30% 的生产力，近期的版本主要在性能，可用性和插件方面进行了更新。\n\n\n对于 Flutter Web 而言，CanvasKit 渲染器已经支持稳定版发布了，接下来 Flutter 将逐步缩小 App 和 Web 之间的差异。\n\n\n比如 Web 的摄像头插件已经得到支持。\n\nPC 端依然还是 beta 阶段，不过可以在 stable 分支通过配置使用，目前还是处于继续优化的阶段。\n\nPC 端的改建主要是在 文本编辑、鼠标键盘、滚动和无障碍这四个方面进行改进，另外之前介绍过的 ubuntu 就默认开始支持 Flutter 了。\n\n\n\nFlutter 广告插件的发布。\n\n支持导入第三方包的 dart pad 现在可以 beta 试用，官方也推荐了一些状态管理的包，比如：provider、flutter_bolc、rivepod。\n\n\n\nFlutter 官方网站的改版，更多资源和例子的官网。\n官网现在还提供 Flutter 学徒的免费教程哦：flutter.dev\n\n\n总的来说这次大会主会场的内容不多，并且基本上看起来都是录制的画面，分会场也是开放了录制的视频，可以重播，有需要的可以直接查看：  https://developersummit.googlecnapps.cn",
