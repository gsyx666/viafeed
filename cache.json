          "description": "每年 iPhone 推出新款之后，如何选择一定是个热门话题。一边是尺寸、功能都「刚刚好」的数字系列，一边是代表着最强移动设备的 Pro 系列，当然价格也是最强。尤其是去年 iPhone 12 mini 的加入，让本就难做的这道选择题变得更难了。\n今年我有机会拿到了 iPhone 13 和 iPhone 13 Pro Max 二台设备，并且也在之前 上手体验 了 iPhone 13 全系列的 4 款机型，对于不同型号 iPhone 的使用体验，以及如何选择的问题，也来聊聊我的看法。\n关联阅读：荧幕、影像、性能处处 Pro，一台没有「短板」的好手机：iPhone 13 Pro 体验\n手感也许「没那么重要」\niPhone 12 mini 的出现，如同手机行业的一场「文艺复兴」：极致的尺寸设计、极佳的握持体验，不少人曾日思夜想的「小屏旗舰」，似乎在这里有了答案。不过，经过一年时间的检验，这台尺寸 mini 的 iPhone，似乎没有许多人当初想得那么好：出色的尺寸设计，牺牲的必然是电池续航；极佳的握持体验之外，好像也无更多优势可言。\niPhone 13 mini\n相反地，在与 iPhone 13 相伴的一周之内，我重新找到了久违的轻松体验：与 iPhone 13 Pro 尺寸相仿的同时，轻了 30 克的手感称为减负毫不为过。作为 Pro 系列 iPhone 的多年用户，上手 iPhone 13 之后，我注意到了一个之前没有发现的细节：铝金属边框相比不锈钢边框，除了不留指纹之外，更加「亲切」的触感对于握持体验而言也有提升；如果要用词语来形容这种「亲切感」，「光滑」与「亲肤」也许较为准确。反观 iPhone 13 Pro 系列，手术级不锈钢边框不论质感还是触感虽然已经足够优秀，但是相比之下摸起来也确实有点「生涩」了。\niPhone 13\n当然，iPhone 13 的握持体验，也让人挑不…",
