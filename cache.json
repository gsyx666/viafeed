I discovered dev.to as another great platform to share developer-related content.\n\nDev.to has dedicated support for posting to the community from RSS. Additionally, dev.to supports canonical linking to protect SEO rankings. Luckily, Hashnode provides an RSS feed so republishing content from Hashnode onto dev.to is easy and fast.\nYou can find your Hashnode RSS feed at https://[your-blog-url]/rss.xml. For example, my feed is at blog.seancoughlin.me/rss.xml. You can also find it linked on your blog page. See the arrow in the screenshot below for the location.\n\nAfter creating a dev.to account, open the settings and head to the Extensions tab. Under the Extensions tab, you will find Publishing to DEV Community from RSS. Simply copy your Hashnode RSS feed into the RSS Feed URL field and hit Save Feed Settings. After a few seconds, your Hashnode articles will appear as drafts in the dev.to dashboard.\n\nTo publish an article you will need to click edit and then change the published: false field to be true.\n\nThat's it! Now your articles will be hosted on dev.to in addition to Hashnode.\n\nPhoto by Universal Eye on Unsplash",

In this post, we will look more closely at a concept mentioned in “the second way”: feedback loops. From the “Three Ways of DevOps”: “The second way is about creating the right to left feedback loops. The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made”.\nIn simple terms, a feedback loop is a process where the outputs of a system are used as inputs again.\nFeedback loops are always …",

A year ago, we were struggling a bit with how to define Jamstack in a world that included the ability to use SSR in a Jamstack application. At the time, this was unique to Next.js, but today you'll find this supported in Nuxt.js 3, Gatsby 4 and even Eleventy via the Eleventy Serverless plugin. Not just that, but we've now added in multiple other kinds of rendering such that I wrote an extensive article clarifying the various types of Jamstack rendering.\n2021 also included the release of some new tools that gained a great deal of popularity very quickly and introduced a new concept, the islands architecture, to the Jamstack.

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nWe use JavaScript objects to store data and retrieve it later. We store data(aka information) in key-value pairs. The key-value pair is also known as the object properties. \nHere is an employee object with three properties: id, name, dept as keys and 007, 'James', and 'Spy' as values.\nconst employee = {\n  id: 007,\n  name: 'James',\n  dept: 'Spy'\n}\n\nSince ES6(ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript provides a mechanism to handle the properties of objects in a much more innovative way. The mechanism is called Destructuring(also known as destructuring assignment). It is more of a new syntax added to the language than a feature.\nIf you like to learn from video content as well, this article is also available as a YouTube video tutorial here: 🙂\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to SUBSCRIBE for future conte…",

          "description": "Today...\nWatch the Event Capture, Propagation and Bubbling video from Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 program. If you want to code along with the video, you can use the contents of folder #25 from the repo you cloned above.\nI found this video to be very interesting because Event Propagation is definitely something I've never encountered before or wouldn't have know about firsthand. \nAs much as I liked Wes's explanation of Event Bubbling in the video, I was still unsure of what was happening. I went ahead and Googled for more information about it. I think the GeeksOnGeeks definition captures it really well:\n\"Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements\".\nEvent Bubbling triggers a selection of all associated elements, a rippling effect. However, not all events bubble.\nAn image from javascript.info was a good visual example of the effect.\n\nEvent Bubbling can be stopped using the stopPropagation() on the event.\n\nBUT DON'T STOP BUBBLING UNLESS NEEDED!\nNext, the video went over Event Capturing which is another phase of Event Propagation (\"Event propagation is a way to describe the “stack” of events that are fired in a web browser.*)\nUnlike Event Bubbling, Event Capturing starts from the top-down to the element. Event Propagation has three phases:\nCapture Phase\nTarget Phase\nBubbling Phase\n\nThe capture phase is rarely used and is implemented by setting the handler \"capture\" option to true.\n\nThe Odin Project\nhttps://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/event-bubbling-in-javascript/\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-simplified-explanation-of-event-propagation-in-javascript-f9de7961a06e/",

Its considered redundant as it adds no information and merely causes visual clutter.\nOvertime comments silently degrade. While code is continuously updated, the comments are forgotten. For a code cryptic in nature, readers turn to the comments to provide an explanation, and when that explanation is false it leaves the readers confused or worse mislead.\n\nThe asterisks in the regex pattern show that  it matches a whole lot more than it was stated by the comments which could be very misleading to the readers who do not bother to check the regex pattern.\nCommenting should be used as a last resort. Every comment serves as a failure to express yourself clearly in code. Always try to clean the code to express yourself better before resulting to commenting. \n\nAfter cleaning it up\n\nA comment should not reference a code that is not present or local because the reference code could change but the comment wouldn't\n\n\n\n\nComments like these are unacceptable especially in production.

And properties in JavaScript do not have to be simple values. They can be implemented using getters and setters, which can execute code. Since the global object inherits from Object.prototype in modern JavaScript engines, adding properties to Object.prototype creates properties on the global object.\nHere, helloWorld is defined as such a getter:\nObject.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {\n  get() { console.log(\"Hello World!\"); },\n});\n\nhelloWorld;           // prints \"Hello World!\"\n\nThankfully this can only happen with global variables, and not with parameters or local variables.\nObject.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {\n  get() { console.log(\"Hello World!\"); },\n});\n\nconst a = helloWorld; // getter is evaluated, prints \"Hello World!\"\na;                    // does nothing\n\nI learned about this strange behavior in a blog post about the globalThis polyfill. In the polyfill, a global property getter is used to access the global this object in different environments such as browsers, web workers, frames, Node.js, and ES modules. Have a look if you want to know more!",

If you don't already know me, my name is Ethan and I'm one of a few Peregrine Programming Language developers. Over the past few months, we've managed to surpass the progress in the 1st write (code for the 1st write has been deleted) and add new features. This post will be discussing the progress that has been made.\nIf you know Python, you know how easy it is. However, it also comes with a big downgrade. Python is slow, and I'm pretty sure every python developer knows this by now. This is kind of annoying. That's where Peregrine comes in.

In Python, the community has the saying of something being the “pythonic way”.\nYes, you should embrace “tradition” and make things simpler for everyone... except when you don’t.\nMany React developers out there will start a project and add Redux (or MobX, or Recoil... ) without even thinking if the project will even need it.\nAnd after they do that, since it’s already there it’s easy to just “go with the motion” and just make things in a way to use Redux.\nThere’s this story that you might have heard, it’s about someone trying to learn the family recipe of baking fish and that “you have to cut the tail to make it good” and then they would go from parent to grandparent to ask why you have to make the cut only to be told that it’s “how it’s always been done to make it good”, and finally the great grandparent will say that the oven was too small back in the day and they had to cut it to fit...\nAnd as history repeats itself, if you found anything I’m saying eerie familiar, then yes, more than 10 years ago Uncle Bob wrote that developers would start a project with a database because “you always needed a database right?”.\nRedux is just one of the latest... moment.js, Lodash, jQuery... remember then?\nRemember that the problem is not if you are or not using then, but WHY are you using it.\nCover Photo by Mohit Tomar on Unsplash",

If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.\nIf it’s still could not find the variable, it will either implicitly declare the variable in the global scope (if not in strict mode) or return an error.\nThe Scope Chain is used to resolve variables.

We'll create an interactive website with a dashboard that shows real-time updates on user actions in this lesson.\nA basic understanding of Python, Flask, and JavaScript (ES6 syntax) is necessary to follow along with this lesson.

The pressure was enormous and the environment around us was even scarier. So this specific problem of deadlines gave us an idea that could in general help us create a streamlined environment for evaluation and assessment.\nOnline classes have not only increased the burden on students but on educators equally.

Nearly every programming language provides a way for us to develop a simple web server, such as Express.js, Go Gin or Python Flask. However, with the advent of serverless computing, we need to rethink some of the fundamentals of how APIs are developed and deployed. Chiefly:\nTraditionally APIs are packaged into one deliverable; serverless architecture encourages to divide solutions up into many smaller units that are packaged and deployed individually.\nTraditionally APIs are stateful applications that are started and stopped infrequently; serverless architecture encourages to start up compute tasks only on demand.\nIn this article, I will describe a way to develop a serverless API in TypeScript.

          "description": "付费订阅服务是一个时不时就会引起热议的话题。去年底，国内外就分别出现过两次付费订阅相关的讨论。\n国内，爱奇艺在 2021 年 12 月 15 日进行了全方面的提价，他们认为「视频平台的会员订阅价格一直偏低，这一现象已影响到了行业的健康发展」了；国外，网红笔记软件 Notability 从「买断制」转成订阅制，在引起广泛不满后道歉，并宣布老用户无需订阅亦可使用已购功能。\n在涉及订阅制和付费的讨论中，一种常见论述是「国外用户付费意愿高，服务定价也高；国内用户付费意愿低，服务定价也低」。这种说法在多大程度上是准确的呢？下面我们分别来讨论。\n国外用户付费意愿一定更高吗？\n在我看来，如今国内网友们付费的意愿并不低；虽然有些应用突然改成订阅很难受，但开发者要生存大家也能理解，对于质量好的也越发愿意付费支持。此类事件中，更让大家觉得懊恼的，是厂商并没有给付费用户提供更好的、符合预期的产品，例如应用对已解锁功能重复收费、视频平台展示所谓「会员专属广告」等。\n当然，准确的观察还是要通过数据来得出。\n2021 年，美国一家咨询公司 West Monroe 对 2500 名美国用户开展了调查，并于八月发布了一份题为《订阅服务开支现状》（The State of Subscription Services Spending）的报告。报告显示，2021 年美国消费者人均订阅服务开支为每月 273 美元，比疫情前 2018 年的 237 美元提高了 15%。这相当于每年多花了 430 美元，折合人民币近 3000 元。\n\n需要指出，West Monroe 报告中的「订阅服务」包括了网费、手机话费等，这些服务在美国的价格非常高昂，而且也不属于本文想讨论的「订阅服务」范畴。将这两项（合计 150 美元）除去后，剩下的实际平均开支应为每人每月 123 美元。\n那我们国内的情况怎么样呢？由于找不到比较系统的研…",

          "description": "作为独立开发者 + 业余吉他手，很早前就想开发一款练习歌曲的工具。因为在练习歌曲时，经常需要针对某一个片段播放上百上千次，有时候需要变调（演奏跟原调不一样）、变速等…… \n这些场景在使用 QQ 音乐之类的播放器时，就显得略为不便，找了一圈也没发现特别趁手的工具。得益于技术的进步，特别是音轨分离的技术（有兴趣可以参考 Splitter.ai）的成熟，感觉针对于「如何更高效地学习歌曲」这个课题，我们可以做出一些更 Cool 更好玩有用的东西。\n这就有了我们最近发布的一款音乐工具产品：AudioJam。\n功能介绍\n使用 AI 技术，AudioJam 能从任意的歌曲中，提取出人声、鼓、贝斯、钢琴或键盘、吉他以及其他的音轨，并可以调整音量 Remix。这个技术在扒谱或者跟歌练习的时候特别有用。\n为了表现它惊艳的分离效果，我制作了一个简单的视频：\n \n分离了音轨之后，在电脑端你甚至可以通过重新安排不同乐器的位置，重新混响音乐，模拟更真实的效果。\n\n设置并保存循环之后，就可以不断重复该循环，用于片段的练习。\n\n如果是常用软件，每个细节都是很重要的，因为如果不好用，那每次使用都会给自己添堵。所以在 AudioJam 中，与传统播放器只能通过拖动进度条来定位不同，你还可以拖动波形图，做到精准地控制播放的位置。AudioJam 还支持直接长按波形图由该位置开始慢速预览，这在扒取一些快速音符的时候很有用。\n通过降速功能则可以有效地降低学习难度，也可以通过升降调，找到最适合自己演奏的曲调。\n\n「音乐附件」是我自己很喜欢的一个功能，可以在音乐项目中。创建便签来记录扒谱的结果、需要注意的地方，也可以导入现有的曲谱，当前附件支持预览 Guitar Pro 的曲谱。将歌曲的学习项目化。\n\n我个人觉得对于歌曲学习来说，移动应用并非最好用的工具，在歌曲学习这件事情上，我还是比较喜欢桌面应用，可以更精准地控制跟快速地输入，因此 AudioJam 支持了 iOS、Android、macOS、Windows 4 个平台。\n\n自动扒谱？\n很多朋友，在试用了 AudioJam 之后都给我提出了一个想法，它能不能做到自动扒谱呢？这个课题我个人的看法是这样的：\n我个人不太认可自动扒谱这件事情，因为音乐学习，不应该以变成「人肉读谱机」为目标。而是通过视听扒谱，去理解鉴赏这个音乐作品，而这个过程是就是不断提升自己音乐审美观以及听力的过程，不应该通过技术来偷懒。\n现在互联网的信息发达，大部分的歌曲都能找到别人精心编排好的乐谱，自动扒取的还无法达到这样的水平。不过我也可能会在未来添加上这样的功能。因为扒谱这件事对新手而言太不友好了，如果能自动扒谱的话，作为一个「参考答案」来辅助学习扒谱的话，可以让学习扒谱这件事变得更简单，学习曲线更平缓，也是一个「高效学习」的好功能。\n所以我们也有在调研一些相关的技术，如果有朋友对相关的音视频技术有研究的话，也欢迎跟我们一起探讨。\n\n如果你也有在玩一些乐器，比如吉他、鼓、钢琴或键盘之类的。AudioJam 绝对是一款对音乐学习很有帮助的产品。希望你可以自己下载来体验试试。\n最后，学无止境，与君共勉。希望大家能一直保持，对吉他和对音乐的热爱。\n \n> 下载少数派 客户端 、关注 少数派公众号 ，发现更多实用 App 📱\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "如今，Apple 全系的 Mac 产品都已经跨入了高分辨率屏幕，最新款的 MacBook Pro 甚至还采用了 mini-LED 技术和 ProMotion 自适应刷新率，为我们带来了笔记本上「天花板级别」一般的显示体验。\n但和 Mac 上高水准的屏幕不同的是，不少人还在用 2K 甚至 1080P 级别的屏幕，忍受着大果粒和小字体带来的麻烦。尽管 Mac 上也有屏幕分辨率调整的选项，但与 Windows 不同的是，Mac 官方仅支持 4K 分辨率以上的屏幕缩放，而 Windows 不仅可以支持各种显示器，还可以自定义缩放的倍数。这也而就意味着，1080P 和 2K 分辨率的显示器，在 Mac 上是无法进行原生的 HiDPI 缩放的，想要实现原生系统级的 HiDPI 支持，最低的条件必须是 4K 显示器。\n\n关于 HiDPI 是什么，这里不再展开介绍，感兴趣的朋友可以在其他地方学习。这里只提一点：即这套 HiDPI 逻辑和早年 Apple 在 Retina 视网膜显示屏开发时有着密不可分的关系。最早的 iPhone 4 实现视网膜显示屏的方式，就是将前代 iPhone 3GS 的 480×320 像素乘以 2，翻倍到了 960×640，并用四个像素渲染一个像素，实现了逻辑分辨率的一致。\n在后来，Apple 一些非视网膜屏幕的产品在升级视网膜屏幕后，也依旧沿用了这个逻辑。例如老款的 MacBook Pro 从 1280×800 升级到视网膜屏幕之后的物理分辨率就变成了 2560×1600，经过 2 倍 HiDPI 缩放之后就和原来的 MacBook Pro 的逻辑分辨率一致了。\n\n在 Intel 时代，我们可以通过一些脚本来实现在 2K 屏幕上的 HiDPI 缩放，以获得更加清晰锐利的显示效果。然而到了 Apple 芯片的 Mac 上，这个方法却失效了。如果想要开启系统的 Hi…",

          "description": "《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。\n我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。\n音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。\n\n\n关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n妖刀王\n点击下载\n55 个回答，查看全部。\nCOMIC LO杂志前一百期有哪些经典内容？\n如何制作一张好的学术海报（poster）？",

          "description": "三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。\n\nWTCR是什么\n讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。\n\n拿到WTCR冠军有多难？\n既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。\n\n摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。\n\n有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。\n\n这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.\n\n在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。\n\n拿到这个冠军有什么意义？\n一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。\n\n在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。\n\n中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。\n\n对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。\n\n对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。\n\n而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n鲁超\n点击下载\n9 个回答，查看全部。\n领克02hatchback和领克032.0冠军版怎么选？\n领克03冠军版与03+驭风版你会选择那个？",

          "description": "看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧\n先上个答案：会也不会\n我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是17岁的时候拿的驾照买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车了，总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，应该是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的也有足够经验能说明问题\n我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。\n赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。\n公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。\n加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…\n至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…\n总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nCoalescence\n点击下载\n35 个回答，查看全部。\n赛车手需要学习漂移吗？\n如果中国有一条不限速的直道公路，你愿意来飙车车吗？",

          "description": "一、区位优势\n青岛作为2020年北方又一个GDP破万亿的城市，除了旅游产业创造的价值，本身具备工业产业链，信息产业链的基础，海尔、海信等企业创造了一定基数的软件人才基数，一汽青岛，烟台现代等储备了一定当量的制造人才。\n自然环境优越宜居，有一定当量的人才基础，房价还不高，很多一线城市被卷怕了的互联网，汽车人才是有可能去安家落户的。\n\n\n二、北方经济增长点\n目前郑州从发展的态势来说，由于交通的区位枢纽优势，整体的工业布局潜力要强于青岛，从GDP增速也可以看到。\n尽管青岛作为全国 GDP 排名前十五的城市，后劲在哪里？从产业机构上来说，海尔海信并没有在青岛孵化更多的信息产业。而旅游业对自然环境的要求既是吸引人才的要素也是抑制大规模工业投资的，这可能会成为产业结构质量提升的掣肘。\n青岛GDP发展的后劲就在利用人才优势绑定支柱产业创造新基建的产业价值，所以青岛需要高合，需要一个可能性来吸引更多的可能性。\n\n\n三、高合需要青岛\n目前的新势力的模式实际上已经逐渐成型了。\nstep 1.用国际一线资本实现从0到1的融资，也是背书。这是资源能力的体现。\nstep2.  合理合规的与地方国有资本促进产业升级的愿望契合并合作，实现区域的自然资源、社会资源、社会资本的整合（如合肥国资委对蔚来的投资，蔚来梦想工厂的落户。）\nstep3. 好好干，车卖得好了资本市场首先就会有反应，其次是地方的GDP对上下游产业链的拉动效应和人才的虹吸效应（exp:小米作为北京国资委2022年重点项目）\n其实不止是汽车产业政府这么做，只是汽车产业动静比较大，对上下游的拉动能力比较强。\n\n\n四、为什么是中国总部？\n其实，还有世界总部、中国总部，软件中心、设计中心、营销中心都可以落户不同的地方，\n获取不同区域的融资。这会是新势力融资的一种趋势，落户+产业合作与引进。\n只要题材做的对，做的到位，产业链的拉动能够促进地方经济的体量和质量的发展，政府就愿意签约。\n作为刚刚做过政府融资的HR。\n政府引进产业、签署招商协议，绝对是有要求，有长远眼光，会有非常细致的GDP+税收的拉动要求的，而且这个钱不好拿。\n但只要企业能够提供政府想要的价值，并且能够说到做到。分阶段的支持就会到来。\n\n\n个人看法，青岛只是开始，今后，产业链相对完整、人才相对充裕的准一线，新一线城市会有更多的新势力落户，这符合国家的期待，也符合新基建的发展规律。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n铳蒙\n点击下载\n2 个回答，查看全部。\n华人运通这家公司是一个什么样的公司？\n深圳和青岛，该选择哪里？",

          "description": "这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：\n1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。\n”盐者，百肴之将“[1]，意思就是盐为\"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。\n同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。\n\n比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。\n比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。\n比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。\n\n\n另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。\n2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性\n人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。\n可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。\n糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。\n3. 盐的可获得性高于糖\n盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。\n大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。\n而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。\n\n综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。\n如果你感兴趣其他关于味觉感官和厨房原理的回答，这里还有一些我回答过其他有意思的问题：\n为什么捏住鼻子就不会尝到味道？\n你是明白了哪几个基本原理之后而厨艺大增的？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n卫小妖GOGOGO\n点击下载\n32 个回答，查看全部。\n有没有替代味精的天然调味品？\n有哪些值得推荐的调味品？",

          "description": "这个题目分为两个方面：\n一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；\n二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。\n1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？\n1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的\n将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。\n最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。\n1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度\n将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。\n如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。\n这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。\n只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。\n下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。\n\n1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果\n至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。\n\n\n\n2.什么样的是好发动机\n热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。\n低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。\n低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。\n高可靠性无需多言。\n两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n广龙先生\n点击下载\n58 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么发动机上最大扭矩不能转化为轮上最大扭矩?\n为什么丰田的2.0发动机有两种功率?",

          "description": "在CES 2022上，索尼公开了第二款概念车VISION-S 0 SUV，而且索尼董事长、总裁兼首席执行官吉田健一郎宣布索尼集团将成立新的部门——索尼移动公司（Sony Mobility Inc），该公司预计在今年春季成立，主要专注于电动汽车商业化。\n\n\nVision-S 02由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队打造，看着看着，这可能成为走向一个新型电动汽车公司的方向么？\n\n\n备注：造车这个事情，戴森走了一轮没走下去。\n\n\n▲图1.Sony的Vision S两款概念车\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\nVision S系列的重点\n\n\n这款概念车是索尼Vision-S由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队来牵头的（机器狗产品Aibo），并且还拉着好几家其他公司来做，包括：NVIDIA、高通、采埃孚、博世（很多部件）、黑莓、QNX、Conti（大量的开发ECU）、本特勒（底盘和电池）、麦格纳（整个EE设计）等等。这个系列最大的特色，还是Vision-S车身内外部署了一套完整的、面向高阶自动驾驶的传感器套件，目的是提供全景影像、360音效、全时连接等特性。\n\n\nSony Vision上的40 个传感器分为：\n16 个 Camera：分为外部8个，分别是环视 4个（IMX390）、侧后摄像头2个（IMX390*2）+、侧视2个（IMX490*2）、内部8个，分别为两个前视立体相机（IMX490*2）、两个ToF 相机（IMX456*2）、驾驶员监控*1、行车记录*1、后摄像头和内部电子个1个、18 个超声波/雷达传感器和 4 个 LiDAR 传感器。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图2.Sony 的Vision S\n\n\n而这台索尼Vision-S的原型车，已经在奥地利参加了公开的路面测试。\n从逻辑上，这是所有参与整个系统构建的一个技术演示，围绕5G技术，可以把诸多感知的电子技术，通过车载系统和云端之间实现高速、高容量和低延迟的连接。也就是说，通过索尼，合作的小伙伴们把VIsion-S打造为一种移动的娱乐空间。\n对于Sony而言，最重要的是需要一个展示的渠道，把Sony在内容、游戏体验和音频上体现出来。通过对VIsion-S的探索，以及合作伙伴的支持，在“移动娱乐空间”这个方向可以有了更多的发展空间。\n\n\n我们仔细研究Sony的业务构成，就能发现索尼已经变成一个围绕游戏机、内容（音乐+电影）的公司。传统上，我们对sony的认知，电子产品只占了1/4不到的业务，而图像传感器CIS是很重要的一块业务。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图3.Sony FY21 Q2的业务构成\n\n\n也就是说，概念车所隶属的Electronics Products & Solutions这个部门，现在已经是一个独立的业务部门。\n从这个意义上来看，Sony和现在苹果的公司结构不一样。苹果可以围绕Apple Car（据说最近苹果抽调了很多资源去做AR和元宇宙了）不停撒钱；Sony肯定和戴森一样烧钱，成立这个业务部门做什么呢？\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图4.索尼的概念车隶属于一个小部门\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\nSony的CIS和激光雷达\n\n\n在Sony科技日展示的内容里面，很重要的一部分就是激光雷达：\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图5.索尼的激光雷达视频\n\n\n有一个重要的背景是，Sony到现在的CIS业务中，在汽车市场里面的占比很低。可以说，索尼的图像传感器CIS部分的新业务开拓，目前还局限在日本车企部分使用，索尼是想通过ADAS领域的需求，能够把自己在移动领域的优势发挥出来。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图6.后疫情时代索尼对于CIS的预测\n\n\n在Vision S系列里面，最多的还是摄像头——这些东西可以作为一个展示给全球汽车企业的方案，并在这个细分市场对安森美进行超越。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图7.Sony的优势CIS领域在汽车里面没做起来\n\n\n\n▲图8.Sony的图像传感器在汽车领域的应用\n\n\n而且一旦有了这个平台，在各项业务和内容中，可以比较容易找到合作伙伴，特别是Sony较少接触的OEM的直接需求——我个人判断这个才是重点，眼下自己去做个汽车公司，完全是得不偿失的事情。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图9.汽车使用的图像传感器，Sony起步较晚\n\n\n\n小结：我个人判断，除了中国和美国，传统欧洲和日本很难出现创业汽车公司，而这两个地方也没有所谓的软件巨头，戴森和Sony这样做产品的公司进入汽车行业也很难赢。\n我想下一步就ADAS摄像头和汽车CIS这个市场进行打开分析，可能效果好一些。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n朱玉龙\n点击下载",

Zynga Poker 是比较稳定流水的产品，这块没太大风险\n2. 休闲品类的能力，可以结合 2K 一些 IP 来做轻度一点的品类，开发周期比较短，靠 IP 加买量也能来一波钱，风险也比较可控\n3. 中重度，应该是看到了收购的工作室 Natural Motions 做的跨端 (移动端 + NS) 4v4 TPS 的 Star Wars: Hunters 品质还比较符合预期，至少能力上是证明了，可以逐步把一些 IP 迁移过去搞中重度收购\n4. 内置的广告系统，手游相互导量，抵消买量的成本\n5. 权益，包括星战和哈利波特 IP 游戏开发权\n\n\n一些想法\n\n马后炮来说，最好当然是过去几年 T2 逐渐收一些手游厂，像 EA 收购 Industrial Toys 或者是自建，比如 Activision Mobile……现在要迅速拉起一块上规模的手游业务，只能收购一些比较成熟的公司\nT2 有点着急了，几款 2K 体育游戏比较稳，但没有可观增量，IP 授权也要给出去一大笔钱；GTA6 还有好几年，别的 IP 比如四海兄弟、江湖本色这些都老化明显，续作比较无力，无主之地的 Gearbox 被 Embracer 卖掉又多了一些未知之数 (虽然 HD 端发行权还是 2K)\n如果能买个国内中型厂是个比较划算的选择，但世界并不是平的\n\n\nMarc\n点击下载\n24 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么R星做游戏这么牛啊？\n真的不懂，R星的游戏到底好玩在哪里？",

          "description": "滑板底盘，理性看待吧。借悠跑科技这个问题，我们仔细聊聊。\n（可看视频，也可速读全文）\n滑板底盘是什么？有没有被夸大？\n首先，滑板底盘，并不是一个新词。\n最初的概念，是由通用汽车在2002年提出的。\n那个时候，通用汽车的脑洞和创造力都非常大。他们发布了Hy-wire概念车，天生自带2个标签，“氢动力+线控底盘“。\n这在当时，相当有突破性。\n\n首先，车身和底盘是分开的。再者，底盘确实是“滑板造型”，基本纯平，而且应用了原属于航空领域的线控技术，才将传统的液压转向、制动等结构抛弃了。\n同时，这还是一款氢能源车。储氢罐布置在底盘中央，电池系统、热管理系统、电机系统，均以模块化的形式布置在储氢罐四周。\n如果将储氢罐替换成动力电池，与如今的电动车“滑板底盘”如出一辙。\n\n那么，底盘与车身之间又是如何连接的？\n通用汽车给出了自己的方案。如果是电器类，则有专门的电器接口实现连接，而机械连接则借助于多个固定连接件。\n最形象的理解，就是将饭盒的上盖，扣在盒身上，再“咔吧”一下，将卡扣夹紧。所以，理论上，一个底盘，可以适配多种形式的车身，而这些连接件设计，又可以满足快速拆卸的要求。\n如果真的实现了，完全可以说，汽车不仅可以换电池，而且可以换车身了。\n\n---------\n滑板底盘的概念重新翻红，主要因为在太平洋彼岸，有一家美国新势力上市了，它的名字叫Rivian。\n（问题中的悠跑科技，也有中国Rivian之称）\nRivian创造了一个行业纪录，上市首日高开约37%，盘中涨幅一度超过53%，市值超1000亿美元，一举超过了通用、福特、本田等传统车企。\n\n它的核心技术，正是滑板式底盘。其他人或许只是将这种底盘当概念，但Rivian真的造出了量产车。\n再回过头，我们定义一下滑板底盘。它是底盘模块化的技术新阶段，是汽车设计和汽车制造的集大成者。\n滑板底盘由机械结构件、电子结构件组成，可划分为前桥、中桥、…",

          "description": "谢邀！\n很荣幸能来和大家分享《紫川》的创作历程，我叫陈闻，我和李振锋李导，共同任职《紫川》项目的导演。首先跟大家同步一个消息，原本预定18号上线的互动剧第2章《血修罗》，在本周播出的第五集中，看“一”送“二”，提前和观众见面了，大家别忘记看哈！\n《紫川》上线以来，我和李导关注了平台上的各种反馈，对于观众的意见和建议，我们都一一记在了小本本上，很感谢大家的反馈，那些都是我们未来努力的方向。 其中有一个意外，那就是《紫川》讨论词条中的最多的竟然是“互动隐藏剧”，怎么说呢，这个意外真的很让人意外……其实，和大家评论的一样，《紫川》的互动形式，属于轻互动，就是在正集一些特殊的剧情点，增设了不影响主线的“隐藏剧集”按钮，观众老爷无论是选择“穿越”观看，还是看完正集，再返回来观看，都是可以的。（宝，你什么都是对的.jpg）\n“番剧互动”这样的概念，我们其实是在项目策划初期就已经提出。我们主要是想给观众更多的选择，但是经过测试，发现剧集暂停→观众选择→剧集播出→剧集暂停→观众选择，这样的形式，不仅影响剧情节奏，还非常废手，尤其是废的还是观众老爷的手，这就得慎重考量了。（正义由我来守护.jpg）\n之后，我们发现《紫川》第一部《紫川三杰》更偏群像戏，比如说，虽然紫川秀是男主角，但其他两位“斯特林”和“帝林”的戏份也非常重要，可是他们常常各自为战，主角紫川秀没有在他身边，导致剧情不是由主角推动的，这会让故事有割裂感。[让人头秃.jpg]\n综合考量后，团队决定将一些主角没有参与，但是非常重要的戏份，以及一些不同时间线的比较精彩的戏份，规划到了隐藏剧环节，比如隐藏互动剧《血修罗》中，冷酷铁血的帝林军团为了胜利，就地掠夺以战养战；为了永绝后患，将身高超过车轮的魔族全部杀掉，播种“恐惧”；为了保证军团作战利益最大化，将奴隶军团送上前线……这段故事中，有充满魅力的人设，外加大规模群集特效、丰富的兵种、血肉对拼的攻城战氛围，虽然游离在主角主线之外，非常经典可看！于是我们将这段戏份单独做成了隐藏互动剧集，和正集一起呈现给观众。\n可以这么理解，《紫川》中，正剧是还原原著剧情主线，互动隐藏剧主要是为了细化扩展重点人物故事！ [就这么愉快的决定了.jpg]\n 好吧，编不下去了，我摊牌了！《紫川》看“一”送“二”的行为，纯粹就是为了能让观众老爷多看点！[不管你信不信，反正我信了.jpg]\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n无名\n点击下载\n6 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价《紫川》动画版第三集？\n《紫川》动画版开播，如何评价前两集？",

          "description": "这的确是个好消息！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你喜欢玩复古游戏，你可能已经接触过复古游戏机模拟器。顺便说一句，所谓“模拟器Emulator”（仿真器）主要是指允许主机系统运行为另一系统设计的游戏的软件或硬件。\n\r\n最近，Cemu 成功引起了开源社区的注意力。它是众多复古电子游戏模拟器之一，可以让你玩为任天堂 Wii U 定制的游戏。然而，到目前为止，它在一个主要方面与大多数模拟器不同，即它是闭源的，但这即将改变。\n\r\nCemu 简介\n\r\nCemu 是一个流行的基于软件的复古电子游戏模拟器，专门模拟任天堂 Wii U 游戏，它是这类模拟器中第一个。它利用了 OpenGL 和 Vulkan 来运行游戏。\n\r\n多年来，它已经有了显著的进展，现在可以 玩整个 Wii U 库中的 51% 的游戏。这包括《马里奥卡丁车 8》和《塞尔达传说：荒野之息》等热门游戏。\n\r\n虽然它早在 2015 年就发布了，但 Cemu 只能运行在 Windows 上。不过，开发者发布的新路线图指出，Cemu 应该很快就会移植到 Linux 上了。\n\r\n而且，最令人关注的是，Cemu 将走向开源！\n\r\n通往开源和 Linux 之路\n\r\n路线图总共包括了由开发人员计划的八个里程碑。其中包括计划开发一个 Linux 移植版并向社区提供代码。\n\r\n谈到 Cemu 的开源问题，开发者计划在 2022 年完成这一工作。所以，你不应该对此寄予厚望。\n\r\n迁移到 Linux 涉及到将源代码从 C 语言改写成 C++ 语言，并从 Visual Studio 迁移到 cmake。\n\r\n以下是开发者对将 Cemu 引入 Linux 的看法：\n\r\n\r\n我们最终想提供一个原生的 Linux 版本。这一直是一个正在进行的副计划，尽管由于优先级较低和依赖于其他任务而进展相对缓慢，但现在已经完成了大约 70% 的工作。\n\r\n\r\n开发人员还提到，移植过程伴随着其他工作，如软件 H264 解码器和 cubeb 后端。由于主要的工作已经完成，可以说 Cemu 很快就会出现在 Linux 上。\n\r\n其他计划\n\r\n开发人员已经考虑将 LLVM 作为 CPU JIT 后端，用于将 PowerPC（Wii U 的主机架构）转换为 ARM 等 X86 架构。\n\r\n他们还刚刚开始着手开发一个新的着色器反编译器，以减少着色器编译时间和卡顿。\n\r\n你可以参考 官方路线图 了解更多细节。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n这对渴望做出贡献并使 Cemu 变得更好的复古游戏爱好者来说绝对是一份大礼。\n\r\nCemu 最终将加入许多流行的、开源的任天堂游戏机模拟器的行列，如 Citra、Dolphin 和 Yuzu。\n\r\n你对 Cemu 的开源有什么看法？复古游戏模拟器应该是闭源的还是开源的？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/cemu-nintendo-linux/\n\r\n作者：Rishabh Moharir 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "星链卫星影响的图像两年间增加了 35 倍\n\r\nSpaceX 旗下“星链”互联网服务需要在轨运行密集的卫星群来提供低延迟网络连接服务。目前已有超过 1500 颗在轨卫星，美国 FCC 此前已经批准了 12000 颗星链卫星的发射。在过去的两年时间里，受星链卫星轨迹影响的图像数量 增加了 35 倍。研究人员估计，如果星链按计划发射所有卫星，几乎每一张观测图像中都至少有一条星链卫星的轨迹。SpaceX 在新一代星链卫星上安装了遮光罩，使卫星亮度下降了大约 4.6 倍，但仍然高于解决问题设定的目标。目前图像中的星链卫星轨迹细小，加之可以通过软件进行识别并处理，所以对天文观测的影响不算大。研究人员估计，目前而言，因为与星链卫星轨迹重合而导致错过罕见天文事件的概率只有 0.04%，但对黄昏观测影响最为严重。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这一问题会随着卫星数量的增加而进一步恶化。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n2021 年针对 Linux 的恶意软件增长了 35%\n\r\n根据 一份报告，2021 年，针对 Linux 系统的恶意软件与 2020 年相比上升了 35%。XorDDoS、Mirai 和 Mozi 是最普遍的系列，占 2021 年观察到的所有针对 Linux 的恶意软件攻击的 22%。之前的 另外一份报告 也证实了这个增长趋势，发现 2020 年 Linux 恶意软件家族比前一年增加了 40%。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：从好的地方看，这代表 Linux 越来越流行了 🤣\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFFmpeg 5.0 发布\n\r\nFFmpeg 被多媒体应用广泛使用，其中之一是 VLC。在这个 版本 中，删除了大量废弃的 API，其中一些 API 甚至在 2013 年就被标识为废弃了，在这个版本之前已经有 4 年没有删除过废弃 API 了。所以如果你的应用使用了废弃 API 的话，请注意升级问题。除了 API 方面的变化，此版本还增加了许多功能，详情请参考 变更日志。此外，FFmpeg 将从 5.0 开始转向基于时间的发布节奏，预期每年都发布一个重大版本，以及每隔一年一个 LTS 版本，5.0 将是第一个 LTS 版本。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然这个软件自己都没有个 GUI，但是却是很多华丽的多媒体应用的动力所在。",

          "description": "配置你的系统使用无根容器。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n容器是现代计算的一个重要组成部分，随着围绕容器的基础设施的发展，新的和更好的工具开始浮出水面。过去，你只需用 LXC 就可以运行容器，然而随着 Docker 得到了普及，它开始变得越来越复杂。最终，我们在 Podman 得到了我们所期望的容器管理系统：一个无守护进程的容器引擎，它使容器和吊舱易于构建、运行和管理。\n\r\n容器直接与 Linux 内核能力（如控制组和命名空间）交互，它们在这些命名空间中产生大量的新进程。简而言之，运行一个容器实际上就是在 Linux 系统内部运行一个 Linux 系统。从操作系统的角度来看，它看起来非常像一种管理和特权活动。普通用户通常不能像容器那样自由支配系统资源，所以默认情况下，运行 Podman 需要 root 或 sudo 权限。然而，这只是默认设置，而且这绝不是唯一可用的设置。本文演示了如何配置你的 Linux 系统，使普通用户可以在不使用 sudo 的情况下（“无根rootless”）运行 Podman。\n\r\n命名空间的用户 ID\n\r\n内核命名空间 本质上是一种虚构的结构，可帮助 Linux 跟踪哪些进程属于同一类。这是 Linux 中的“队列护栏”。一个队列中的进程与另一个队列中的进程之间实际上没有区别，但可以将它们用“警戒线”彼此隔离。要声明一组进程为“容器”，而另一组进程为你的操作系统，将它们分开是关键。\n\r\nLinux 通过用户 ID（UID）和组 ID（GID）来跟踪哪个用户或组拥有的进程。通常情况下，一个用户可以访问一千个左右的从属 UID，以分配给命名空间的子进程。由于 Podman 运行的是分配给启动容器的用户的整个从属操作系统，因此你需要的不仅仅是默认分配的从属 UID 和从属 GID。\n\r\n你可以用 usermod 命令授予一个用户更多的从属 UID 和从属 GID。例如，要授予用户 tux 更多的从属 UID 和从属 GID，选择一个还没分配用户的适当的高 UID（如 200000），然后将其增加几千：\n\r\n$ sudo usermod \\\r\n    --add-subuids 200000-265536 \\\r\n    --add-subgids 200000-265536 \\\r\n    tux\r\n\n\r\n命名空间访问\n\r\n对命名空间数量也有限制。这通常被设置得很高。你可以用 systctl，即内核参数工具来验证用户的命名空间分配：\n\r\n$ sysctl --all --pattern user_namespaces\r\nuser.max_user_namespaces = 28633\r\n\n\r\n这是很充足的命名空间，而且可能是你的发行版默认设置的。如果你的发行版没有这个属性或者设置得很低，那么你可以在文件 /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf 中输入这样的文本来创建它：\n\r\nuser.max_user_namespaces=28633\r\n\n\r\n加载该设置：\n\r\n$ sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\r\n\n\r\n在没有 root 权限的情况下运行一个容器\n\r\n当你设置好你的配置，重启你的计算机，以确保你的用户和内核参数的变化被加载和激活。\n\r\n重启后，试着运行一个容器镜像：\n\r\n$ podman run -it busybox echo \"hello\"\r\nhello\r\n\n\r\n容器像命令一样\n\r\n如果你是第一次接触容器，可能会觉得很神秘，但实际上，它们与你现有的 Linux 系统没有什么不同。它们实际上是在你的系统上运行的进程，没有仿真环境或虚拟机的成本和障碍。容器和你的操作系统之间的区别只是内核命名空间，所以它们实际上只是带有不同标签的本地进程。Podman 使这一点比以往更加明显，当你将 Podman 配置为无根命令，容器感觉更像命令而不是虚拟环境。Podman 使容器和吊舱变得简单，所以请试一试。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/run-containers-without-sudo-podman\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这是 Linux 走向大众最重要的一件事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n你可能看过 最近 Linus Tech Tips 关于切换到 Linux 的视频，以及 他对 KDE 软件的一些抱怨的那个视频。对于那些关注此事的人，我想让你们知道，我们（KDE）正在努力修复 Linus 提出的问题，你们可以在 这里 跟踪我们的进展。值得庆幸的是，大部分的问题都相当小，应该很容易解决。\n\r\n关于桌面 Linux 需要什么才能成为主流的问题。Sway 开发者 Drew DeVault 针对该视频发表了一篇文章，而这篇博文是我的版本。Drew 强调了可访问性，我也同意，但结论略有不同。\n\r\n桌面 Linux 需要预装在零售硬件上才能在主流市场取得成功\n\r\n就是这样。\n\r\n请允许我解释一下。\n\r\n人们经常被功能和可用性所困扰，这些都很重要，但它们只是达到目的的手段，本身并不是目的。如果人们根本不能得到它，质量就毫无意义。而如果没有可访问的发行版，人们就无法得到它。高质量的 Linux 发行版还不够；它们需要被预装在你可以在主流零售店买到的硬件产品上。“主流人群”会购买他们可以触摸和拿起的产品；如果在主流商店找不到它，它就不存在。\n\r\n想一想，为什么普通人都使用 Windows 或 macOS？因为他们购买的实体电脑包含了它。iOS 或 Android 呢？它被默认装在了他们的实体智能手机上。对于“主流人群”来说，不存在用一个新的操作系统替换设备的操作系统的想法。只有 “三点”用户 才会这么做，而他们只占市场的 5% 左右。如果获得你的操作系统的唯一途径是自己安装，那么你就没有机会在主流市场取得成功。\n\r\n\n\r\n至于功能，人们通常只使用可用功能的很小的一部分。在可用性方面，大多数用户是 记住他们的软件如何使用而不是理解它 —— 如果你真的需要，你可以记住任何东西。一个更好的用户界面会有所帮助，但是对于那些记忆这些的人来说并不是必需的，而它主要有利于那些能够识别模式，并欣赏逻辑、一致性和良好设计的高级用户（市场上 30% 的“二点及以上”人群）。因此，这些东西本身就不够好。\n\r\n但这并不意味着我们应该忘记功能和可用性！一点也不。但是如果我们的目标是“走向主流”，我们就必须了解真正的受众：是硬件供应商，而不是终端用户。我们的目标是让软件产品有足够的吸引力，以便在供应商选购时被他们选中，因为它基本上就是这样做的。像苹果这样为知名产品定制自上而下的硬件和软件的公司很少。大多数公司都建立在第三方软件之上，这些软件需要他们内部软件团队进行最少的整合和定制工作。如果你的软件不能胜任，他们会转向下一个选择。因此，当一些硬件供应商有需求时，你的软件最好已经准备好了！\n\r\n而硬件供应商需要什么？\n\r\n\r\n灵活性。你的软件必须容易适应他们的任何类型的设备，而不需要大量的定制工程，他们将在产品的生命周期中负责支持。\n\r\n能使他们的设备看起来不错的功能。对其物理硬件特性的支持、良好的性能、令人愉快的用户界面……人们购买它的理由基本上是这些。\n\r\n稳定性。不能崩溃并将用户抛弃在命令行终端提示符下。必须可以实际工作。不能让人感觉像一个业余的科学展览会项目。\n\r\n可用性要足够好，以减少支持成本。当出现问题时，“主流人群”会联系他们的硬件供应商。可用性需要足够好，以便尽可能少地发生这种情况。\n\r\n\r\n它不需要完美。它只需要做这些事情。这就是 Windows 在 90 年代征服了个人电脑市场的方式，尽管它很糟糕！而我们的东西要好得多！\n\r\n我看到有证据表明 KDE 已经是这样了。Pine 在 PinePhone 和 PineBook Pro 上分别为 Manjaro 提供了 Plasma 的移动版和桌面版。Valve 也为 Steam Deck 选择了 Plasma 的桌面版，在他们的新版 SteamOS 中取代了 GNOME。我认为 KDE 软件定位良好，并且一直在变得更好。因此，让我们继续加倍努力提供硬件供应商销售其出色产品所需的东西。\n\r\n原文由 KDE 开发者 Nate Graham 发表在他的 博客 PointiestStick 中。 本文经许可后转载。所表达的观点代表作者自己，可能不能反映我们的观点。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/what-desktop-linux-needs-to-succeed-in-the-mainstream/\n\r\n作者：Nate Graham 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "提前了解一下 Pop!_OS 即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境。仅供参考。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你还不知道，System76 的开发者一直在 致力于开发一个新的桌面环境（被称为 COSMIC），它是用 Rust 编写的，Rust 是一种内存安全的超快编程语言。\n\r\n从头开始创建一个桌面环境不是一件小事。这涉及到创建从合成器、面板、窗口管理器到桌面环境的 API 和其他后端任务的一切。\n\r\n这不是一件容易的事，而维护它又是另一回事。\n\r\n而且，看起来 System76 已经开始了这方面的工作。\n\r\n在 GitHub 上，你会发现已经有一个名为 cosmic 的仓库，但它主要是使用 JavaScript（用于创建 GNOME shell 扩展的语言）编写的。这就是 cosmic shell 扩展仓库，也就是 Pop!_OS 现在所搭载的。\n\r\n在他们的 GitHub 中还有几个较新的仓库，这些恰好是他们即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面的元素。\n\r\n所以，现在是时候构建、测试并提前了解一下了。\n\r\n\r\n注： 澄清一下，目前 Pop!_OS 上基于 GNOME 的桌面环境叫做 COSMIC。而本文讨论的是基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，它是从头开始构建的，旨在取代当前的产品。\n\r\n\r\n基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验\n\r\n打算成为 COSMIC 桌面环境整体一部分的三个仓库是：\n\r\n\r\n设置应用\n\r\n顶部面板（目前用于 X11 系统）\n\r\n合成器（似乎支持原生的 wayland、xwayland 和 X11 系统）\n\r\n\r\nCOSMIC 设置应用\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n注意： 这是一个半生不熟的早期预览，以让你有个大致印象。随着开发的继续，用户界面可能会有根本性的变化。所以，仅用于参考。\n\r\n\r\n这是 Pop!_OS 的新 COSMIC 桌面的设置应用。它目前还在开发当中，没有准备好使用，不过如果你想运行它并试试界面，请随意！\n\r\n那么，它看起来与目前的 COSMIC 体验有什么不同呢？\n\r\n\n\r\n在写这篇文章时，该用户界面似乎没有与任何后端 API 相连接。启用和禁用 “为工作区启用左上角热角 ”的切换并没有什么变化，其他的切换也是如此，除了设置应用的 “关于” 部分所显示的信息。\n\r\n仔细看截图，放置的位置很凌乱，但作为早期预览（或原型）来说也是正常的。\n\r\n看起来他们正在用圆角和更干净的外观来处理一切。\n\r\n切换动画感觉快速、流畅和迅捷（即使是在虚拟机内，我等不及在裸机上尝试）。但考虑到它甚至还没有功能，谈论性能没什么意义。\n\r\n\n\r\n就个人而言，我不喜欢他们所采用的圆角外观。在我看来，GNOME 对圆角的实现是完美的。但是，看看它的结果应该是很有趣的。\n\r\n顶部面板\n\r\n作为 COSMIC 桌面环境的一部分，顶部面板也正在使用 Rust 语言实现。\n\r\n至于这个顶部面板的外观，我不太确定如何测试它才不算对它不公平。从 GNOME 中启动它，会在 GNOME 的顶栏后面打开它。所以我想在一个单独的窗口管理器中打开它（到目前为止只用 bspwm 和 i3-wm 试过），但这导致了一些古怪的行为，比如面板像普通 GUI 软件一样占据了全部垂直空间。\n\r\nCOSMIC 合成器\n\r\nCOSMIC 桌面环境的合成器编译成功了，但在与 bspwm 或 i3-wm 一起使用时却无法启动。我试着在窗口管理器中启动它，因为 GNOME 不允许改变合成器。\n\r\n这是由于在使用 VirtualBox 的虚拟机中，视频驱动的混乱以及 COSMIC 合成器还没有准备好。\n\r\n但是，还有更多！\n\r\n开发者 Eduardo Flores 也尝试了新的 COSMIC 桌面，在他的 博客文章 中分享了一些应用启动器和坞站的截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n应用程序启动器看起来很相似，但是使用 GTK 构建的。同样，你也可以期待 Pop!_OS 21.10 引入一个类似的应用程序库，以及经典的坞站。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n当然，现在说发展的方向还为时过早。\n\r\n要期待一个成熟的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验的测试版，应该还需要一段时间。\n\r\n但是，从我们在这里看到的情况来看，我很兴奋。\n\r\n你怎么看？欢迎你在下面的评论中分享你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/system76-rust-cosmic-desktop/\n\r\n作者：Pratham Patel 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "机器学习方案将帮助不同的无线电协议，如 Wi-Fi 和 LTE，在同一的无线频谱中更有效地协同工作。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）开发的机器学习方案有可能显著改善 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率的方式。研究人员声称，与试错法相比，NIST 的方案可以使共享通信频率的过程的效率提高多达 5000 倍。\n\r\nNIST 系统的理念是，无线电设备可以从经验中学习其网络环境，而不是像现在这样，简单地根据试错法选择频率信道。\n\r\nNIST 在 其网站上的一篇文章 中说，在特定的环境条件下，“该算法可以学习哪个信道提供最好的结果”。\n\r\n该团队说:“该方案可以被编程到现实世界中许多 [不同] 类型网络的发射机软件中。”\n\r\n从本质上讲，这个计算机模拟的算法是一个映射环境射频条件的先前经验的公式。例如，这些条件可以包括在一个信道（一组相邻的频率）内运行的发射机的数量。\n\r\n文章说：“……如果发射机选择了一个未被占用的信道，那么成功传输的概率就会上升，从而导致更高的数据速率。”同样地，当发射机选择一个没有太多干扰的信道时，信号会更强，你也会得到更好的数据速率。发射机会记住哪个信道提供了最佳结果，并学会在下次需要清晰信号时学会选择那个位置。\n\r\n这与今天的工作方式不同。也就是说，无线电只是试图找到一个开放频率，然后与类似协议的无线电进行通信。在复杂的情况下，使用诸如 Wi-Fi、跳频和 波束成形 等技术来优化信道。\n\r\n研究人员解释说，NIST 的机器学习技术的亮点在于共享频谱，比如通过授权频谱辅助接入（LAA）共享 Wi-Fi。LAA 是非授权频谱中的 LTE 频谱，称为 LTE-U，频率为 5GHz。在相同频率下的 Wi-Fi 与 LAA 的组合中，协议是不同的：无线电之间不能相互通信以协调工作，而且频带越繁忙就可能出现混乱 —— 传输会遇到其他传输。但是，如果所有的无线电接收机都能更好地选择它们的占位，通过学习哪些有效，哪些无效，那么这将会更好。\n\r\nNIST 工程师 Jason Coder 在文章中说：“这可能会使非授权频段的通信更加高效。”\n\r\n事实上，NIST 声称，它“可以帮助 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率，其效率大约是试错法的 5000 倍。”\n\r\n这里的关键词是“共享”，因为为了在有限的频谱内增加通信，必须进行更多的共享 —— 物联网或媒体流等用户都在争夺同样的隐喻资产。随着物联网和数字技术的不断发展，非授权和授权频段的结合，就像 LAA 中的情况一样，可能会变得更加普遍。（非授权的频段是指那些没有分配给特定用户的频段，比如移动网络运营商；授权频段是在拍卖中中标并分配的。）\n\r\n在 NIST 场景中，相互竞争的发射机“各自学习在不相互通信的情况下最大化网络数据速率”。因此，多种协议和数据类型，如视频或传感器数据，或 Wi-Fi 和移动网络，可以相互协作。\n\r\nNIST 的方案大大简化了为发射机分配最佳信道的过程，根据这篇文章研究发现，穷尽努力 [使用试错法] 来确定最佳解决方案需要大约 45600 次试验，而这个方案只需要尝试 10 个渠道就可以选择类似的解决方案，仅仅付出 0.02% 的努力。”\n\r\nNIST 的研究人员在 IEEE 第 91 届车辆技术会议上展示了他们的研究成果。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3561618/nist-aims-to-make-frequency-sharing-more-efficient-for-wireless-networks.html\n\r\n作者：Patrick Nelson 选题：lujun9972 译者：CN-QUAN 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "我往年的年终总结（2020，2019， 再早的都没有搬运到这个博客，随着年龄增长似乎对淡忘记忆想要记录的惶恐也少了很多，忘了的就忘了吧）似乎都不能称之为“年终总结”，更像是“编月史”似的流水账。 而且我惊奇地发现拖延症如我过去两年的总结居然都是新年准时发布。今年拖到这么晚，除了难得跨年时候有事干忙着现充没时间写博客外，回想一下更有点潜意识里的逃避——不是因为过去一年过得不好，而是因为过得太好，很多事情要么过于私人不便分享，要么情感方面表达无能不知道要怎么写下来才能准确地记录下来当下的心情。大概因为如此我宁愿先写了个 2021 Matters 的问卷，也没有着手开始写年终总结。不过，既然说是 best year yet，那总还是得记录下来点什么吧。 Achievements 生活 从上一份工作辞职啦 开始 routinely 锻炼和 IF，在任由体重暴增 30 磅的几年之后减回了新的目标体重，身体素质也好了很多，力气也变大很多 虽然辞职期间没有完成之前计划的 side…",

          "description": "TinyWang: 背景：今天把充电盒搞丢了，官方售后补一个要 800 块。两只耳机电池状态感觉上不太好，但是具体续航时间没有测试。AirPods 是有 AC+的，还有不到两个月到期，可以意外换新。\n问题：\n1.AirPods 的 AC+是通过充电盒的序列号注册的吗，如果我去售后或从第三方买了原装充电盒并和耳机配对，AC+会对新的充电盒生效或继承过去吗\n2.现在通过 AC+换新可以把旧款充电盒换成 Magsafe 充电盒吗，不管可以与否，如何以最低代价换一套新的耳机和 Magsafe 充电盒呢\n3.本人身处十八线小城市，只有一家百邦的 Apple 授权售后点，不知道能不能用 AC+检测或换新 AirPods\n主要还是在意第二条，本来想趁 AC+过期前去检测一下电池换一套，结果转眼就把充电盒丢了，闹心了一天。我明白弄丢肯定是我自己的问题，但是如果能有办法比 800 块买新的少花一点的话就最好了😥",

          "description": "allenchen10: \nTLDR\nV2Reader 是一个用 SwiftUI 开发的，在 iOS 、iPadOS 和 macOS 上的 V2EX 第三方客户端。因为所有的数据都是通过访问 V2EX API 2.0 Beta 来获取的，而这份文档还在更新，有很多数据没有提供，所以 V2Reader 的功能还比较有限。之后随着 API 的更新，会有更多功能加入。\n简介\n我前段时间看到 V2EX API 2.0 的页面，就试了试，当时还提了一个小 Issue，站长很快就修复了。那个时候刚好还在放假，想着入门一下 iOS 开发，然后用这些 API 写一个客户端练手。之后大概花了两周时间开发到当前版本，目前只用了 SwiftUI 原生的组件，没有使用第三方库。因为才刚接触 Swift ，基本是一边学一边写，很多地方的代码还有点乱，等以后整理好了应该会开源。\n安装\n加入 Beta 版“V2Reader for V2EX” - TestFlight - Apple\n设备要求\niOS/iPadOS 15 以上，或者 macOS 12 Monterey 以上（使用了 Catalyst ，所以 Intel Mac 也可以安装）。\n功能\n通过不同节点访问主题以及回复\n\n搜索节点并关注或者将节点添加到主页\n\n点击发布者或回复者的用户名查看用户信息\n\n自动在 @用户 后添加楼层号，可以点击跳转到对应的楼层，然后点击蓝色箭头跳回原楼层\n\niPad 版本以三列视图显示，支持分屏或小窗模式\n\nMac Catalyst 版本\n\nFAQ\n为什么不支持更低的系统版本？\n主要是因为我用了很多去年 WWDC 新加入的语法，比如 AsyncImage 、MainActor 、task 、refreshable 、searchable 之类的。\n为什么 API 2.0 Beta 已经有了获取提醒的 API ，但软件内还没有实现？\n有两个原因：一、这个 API 获取的内容都是 HTML 格式的，我还没有考虑用什么方式去解析，不像帖子中的内容是 Markdown 格式的，可以用 iOS 15 新引入的 AttributedString 。二、这个提醒 API 还获取不到帖子的 id ，暂时也没办法实现点击跳转帖子的功能。\n为什么有些 Markdown 格式的内容没有正常显示？\n因为 AttributedString 还没有支持 Markdown 格式的全部语法，我猜测下次 WWDC 会支持更多。\n为什么不支持 App 内发帖 /回帖 /收藏 /感谢等功能？\n我暂时打算只使用 API 2.0 Beta ，而这些数据目前还无法通过这些接口获取。当然如果需要的人很多，我之后可能会用解析网页之类的方式来实现。目前点击发帖回帖的按钮会跳转到网页版。\n为什么需要用 Token 来登录？可不可以使用账号密码或者免登录？\nV2EX API 2.0 Beta 必须有 Token 才能够访问，用户需要在设置中自己创建 Token ，然后复制粘贴到 App 中，App 会将 Token 放入系统的 Keychain 保存。用 Token 是否安全，可以参考站长 @Livid 在这个帖子中的回复。\n为什么使用一段时间之后加载不出内容了，重新启动之后显示 Token 无效？\n站长设置了每小时最多请求 API 600 次，这种情况可能是达到了限制，可以等整点后再尝试。\n为什么主页中最多只能添加 5 个节点？\n主页每次刷新时，每个节点都需要单独访问一次 API ，主页中包含的节点过多会导致很快达到 API 请求次数的上限，目前设置的是最多 5 个，如果觉得不够请在 TestFlight 里反馈，我会考虑在之后的版本里调整。\n最后\n我写这个 App 只是作为学习 Swift 的练手，目前支持的功能还不多，并不能代替网页版或者别的优秀 App ，大家有兴趣的话欢迎加入 TestFlight 测试体验，反馈使用中的问题和需要改进的地方。",

          "description": "qloog: \n2022 年给自己定一个小目标，万一实现了呢？ 不，是一定要实现 😝\n概要\n近几年各大应用基本都有社区（动态）的功能，展现形式各不相同，比如国内的有：\n微博\n朋友圈\n抖音\n小红书\n国外的有：\nInstagram\nTwitter 等（当然他们做的就更糟早了）。\n也算是比较流行的一个 feature 了，刚好本人近几年也一直从事此类的开发，所以准备搭建一套出来。\n社区在 APP 中的作用\n简单来说就是使用动态功能可以提高用户在应用内的活跃度，让用户在应用内停留的时间更长(个人观点)。\n当然最基本的用户功能也是需要有的，那么如果一个用户发了一条动态，粉丝如何收到呢？ 所以这里也离不开关系服务。可以先来看下整体架构。\n为什么要做这么一套服务？\n主要有两个目的\n之前都是使用 restful API 来开发的，基础服务会用 gRPC 来实现，同时也对之前做的一些不好的地方做下优化和改进\n把实现思路开放出来，希望可以帮助到需要的同学\n💡 如果有觉得设计不好的地方也欢迎提供建议，共同改进。\n通过这套微服务可以学到什么？\n微服务如何划分\n代码目录如何分层\nREST 的使用\ngRPC/ProtocolBuffer 的使用\nGORM/Redis/Kakfa 在 Go 中的使用\n链路追踪的使用\n微服务在 K8S 中如何部署\n等等...\n业务架构图\n\n服务划分\n该微服务系统整体会包含如下 4 大服务：\n1. 用户服务(gRPC+Protocol Buffer)\n该服务主要提供以下功能\n注册\n登录\n更新用户信息\n获取用户信息\n批量获取用户信息\n2. 关系服务(gRPC+Protocol Buffer)\n该服务主要提供以下功能\n关注\n取消关注\n批量获取关注关系\n粉丝列表\n关注列表\n3. 动态服务(HTTP)\n该服务主要提供以下功能\n发布动态\n获取动态详情\n点赞动态\n评论动态\n回复评论\n点赞评论\n我发布过的动态列表\n我关注的动态列表\n最新的动态列表\n4. 聚合层服务\n主要对外提供 API 服务，面向的是前端，比如 WEB, iOS, Android 等\n上面的几个服务大部分接口都会从此服务进行逻辑调用处理。比如处理用户数据，关系数据等\n技术选型\n开发框架 🦅 eagle 微服务框架\n开发语言 Go\n分布式缓存 Redis\n数据存储 MySQL\n数据库操作 GORM\nRPC 通信 gRPC + Protocol Buffer\n应用部署 Docker + K8S + Helm\n监控告警 Prometheus + Grafana\n分布式链路追踪 Jaeger\n消息队列 Kafka/RabbitMQ\n开发步骤\n会按照服务逐个进行开发，最后在聚合服务中进行组合，最后供客户端进行调用。\n聚合服务 ins-app\n  用户相关 API 开发\n  关系相关 API 开发\n  动态相关 API 开发\n用户服务 user-service\n  画架构图\n  数据库定义\n  proto 定义\n  定义 repo/service\n  业务逻辑实现\n  注册 grpc 服务进行测试\n关系服务 relation-service\n  画架构图\n  数据库定义\n  proto 定义\n  定义 repo/service\n  业务逻辑实现\n  注册 grpc 服务进行测试\n动态服务 moment-service\n  画架构图\n  数据库定义\n  proto 定义\n  定义 repo/service\n  业务逻辑实现\n  注册 grpc 服务进行测试\n🔚 好，小目标定完了😝，后面就是撸起袖子加油干了了 😭\n原文(不定期更新)： https://legend-hero-0e2.notion.site/Go-0-1-Instagram-6597618e65a647d282a7d45ff2554246",

          "description": "CloudStorage: \n前言\n随着业务规模的不断扩大，企业越来越重视构建高性能、高可用的大型分布式系统。为了解决应用耦合，合理进行流量削锋，腾讯云提供了包括 CKafka 和 TDMQ 在内的一系列消息队列中间件。为了更方便地对消息队列中的数据进行转存和持久化，腾讯云对象存储 COS 为用户提供了云消息队列备份的能力。\n一、云消息队列备份方案-使用 COS 应用集成备份\nCOS 应用集成 是腾讯云对象存储 COS 基于 Serverless 云函数，为开发者提供的存储数据应用解决方案。开发者只需要在 COS 控制台一键配置，即可使用丰富的功能。\nCOS 应用集成提供了云消息队列备份的能力，开发者可以轻松配置定时备份任务，将云消息队列中的消息记录以文件的形式转至对象存储，以便进行持久化保存。开发者可以通过备份文件提取消息记录，对消息进行入库、统计分析等操作。\n\n二、方案优势\n存储成本低：对象存储支持数据归档和降冷，长期存储成本低；\n可视化操作：一键配置，简化开发流程，无需编码工作；\n指定范围：可指定消费的起始位置，排除不需要的记录；\n消息聚合：可按分钟维度聚合消息记录，并支持修改时间粒度；\n自动化执行：云函数自动完成云消息队列 CKafka / TDMQ 的数据备份，中间过程无需任何人工操作；\n三、云消息队列介绍\n**消息队列 **CKafka （ Cloud Kafka ）是一个分布式、高吞吐量、高可扩展性的消息系统，100%兼容开源 Kafka API 0.9.0 至 2.8.0 版本。CKafka 基于发布订阅模式，通过消息解耦，使生产者和消费者异步交互，无需彼此等待。CKafka 具有数据压缩、支持离线和实时数据处理等优点，适用于日志压缩收集、监控数据聚合等场景。\n**消息队列 TDMQ **（ Tencent Distributed Message Queue ）是腾讯基于 Apache Pulsar 自研的一个云原生消息中间件系列，其中包含兼容 Pulsar 、RabbitMQ 、RocketMQ 等协议的消息队列子产品，得益于其底层计算与存储分离的架构，TDMQ 具备良好的弹性伸缩以及故障恢复能力。\n四、备份任务设置步骤\n这里以设置 CKafka 消息备份任务为例，TDMQ 设置与之相似：\n登录腾讯云 对象存储 COS 控制台。\n在左侧导航中，单击 [应用集成] ，找到 [ CKafka 消息备份] 。\n单击 [配置备份规则] ，进入规则配置页面。\n单击 [添加函数] 。注意：如果您尚未开通云函数服务，请前往 云函数控制台 开通云函数服务，按照提示完成服务授权即可。\n在弹出的窗口中，配置如下信息：\n\na.函数名称：作为函数的唯一标识名称，创建后不可修改（您可以在云函数控制台上查看该函数）。\nb.关联存储桶：存放 CKafka 消息的 COS 存储桶。\nc.时间粒度：根据消息量的大小，选取汇聚消息的时间间隔，时间间隔为 5 - 15 分钟不等。为保证转存性能，聚合文件数量与 Partition 数量、partition_max 设置数值有关。有关 Partition 的说明，请参见分区。\nd.SCF 授权：CKafka 消息备份需要授权云函数从您的 CKafka 服务中读取相关实例消息，并将消息转存至您指定的存储桶中。因此需要添加此授权。\n6.单击 [下一步] ，进行 CKafka 配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.实例选择：选择消息来源的 CKafka 实例，仅支持同地域的 CKafka 实例。\nb.主题选择：选择消息来源的主题。\nc.起始位置：消息转储备份时历史消息的处理方式，topic offset 设置。\nd.访问地址：必须为 VPC 内网访问地址，基础网络的 CKafka 实例请添加路由策略，具体请参考 添加路由策略。注意：对应的 VPC 子网中必须有可用的 IP ，且必须支持 DHCP 。\n7.单击 [下一步] ，进行投递配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.投递的路径：备份文件的投递路径前缀，不填写则默认保存在存储桶根路径，指定前缀必须以斜杠 “ / ” 为结尾。\n8.添加配置后，单击 [确认] ，即可看到函数已添加完成。\n\n五、查看备份文件\n等待一段时间后，可以看到存储桶下投递了备份文件，其内容的每行代表一条消息记录。\n\n\n\n好了，本期关于云备份方案将分享到这里，欢迎点击“链接”，查看更多云消息队列备份攻略。",
