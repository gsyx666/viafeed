          "description": "A mobile app lifecycle is divided into various stages, from its first line of code to the submission request. Within these stages, one aspect that holds the key to creating an app is its testing. This field carries the burden of quality and stamps an application to guarantee that no storm would break it down.\nIn this blog, we will talk about things that matter when mobile app testing is done. For example, why do some apps show more trust but some don’t even after passing through the same testing phases? What is that subtle difference that can make all the difference? What can we do to make “testing” right?\nBefore exploring the answers to these questions and analyzing their impact, let’s understand why it is important to test mobile apps on multiple devices.\nDid you know?

          "description": "In this post let's talk about the paradigm shift from lifecycle methods to state synchronization and hooks in ReactJs.\nHere is a video version of this post, if that's what you prefer. \n\n\n\n\nWhen class components were a thing in ReactJs (Well it still is, but no one likes them anymore), we use to think a lot in terms of mouting, unmounting, and lifecycle methods.\n\nWhenever a class component mounts, the lifecycle methods are called in following sequence: constructor → render → DOM and refs update → componentDidMount\nBut then came React Hooks, and we started to think in terms of dependency array.\nAnd, often times we ask:\nWhat is the hooks equivalent to [some lifecycle method]?\nThe quick answer is that hooks are a paradigm shift from thinking in terms of \"lifecycles\" to thinking in terms of \"state and synchronization with DOM\". Trying to take the old paradigm and apply it to hooks just doesn't work out very well and can hold you back.\nuseEffect(fn) // fn invoked on all updates\n\nuseEffect(fn, []) // invoked on mount\n\nuseEffect(fn, [a, b, c]) // invoked if any of the members of the array are updated\n\nThe above snippet is not the right way to think about React hook.\nLifecycles are gone, but we still think of useEffect with empty dep array as componentDidMount, and that’s not the right way to think about React Hooks.\nNow I want to present to you the right way to think about react hooks.\nSee, the question is not \"when does this effect run\" the question is \"which state does this effect synchronizes with\"\nuseEffect(fn) // useEffect with no dep array, sync with all state\n\nuseEffect(fn, []) // useEffect with empty dep array, sync with no state\n\nuseEffect(fn, [stateA, stateB]) // useEffect with stateA and stateB in dep array sync with stateA and stateB.\n\nAnd that’s how you should think about React Hooks.\nHope, you found this video useful, and if so, make sure show your support by subscribing.\nI also run a weekly newsletter, so you can join me there also: https://www.getrevue.co/profile/8020lessons\nThank You!",

You’ve spent half a sprint adding a new feature to your microservice. You’ve thoroughly researched possible inputs and database states and built an elaborate test suite. Your code was mercilessly reviewed by two of your teammates. Finally, the tests pass, the pull request is approved, and as a final verification, you deploy your new code to the staging environment…\nWhere it crashes almost immediately. Turns out you forgot to test some obscure configuration, or some complex database state that would only ever occur on a mature, complex environment - like staging, and unlike your local machine.\nThe worst part being that you know it’s going to happen again next sprint.\nI’ve encountered some variation of the dev loop at every startup I’ve ever worked in, and it’s this pain exactly that we’re trying to solve with mirrord. mirrord runs in two places - on your local development machine, and in your staging environment. By wrapping your local process and hooking system calls, it lets you plug your process non-invasively into that service’s instance on the staging environment. \n \nToday we’re releasing mirrord 2.0, which supports incoming traffic. That means whatever traffic reaches your service in staging is duplicated by mirrord and sent to your local process. We’ll soon be adding support for outgoing traffic, file access, and environment variables - everything needed for your local process to “think” it’s running on the staging environment.\n1. You can use it as either a CLI tool, or an extension for VS Code (IntelliJ support is on the way). Try it out here, and let us know what you think at hi@metalbear.co, or in our repo!\nnote that mirrord doesn’t install anything persistent in your Kubernetes cluster. It runs a job that self-deletes when mirrord terminates. ↩",

          "description": "When working on accessibility, a common issue you might come across is that your HTML tag doesn't have a lang attribute.\nThe lang attribute tells the user which language the page is written in.\nSome examples of valid lang attributes are:\n<!-- French content -->\n<html lang=\"fr\"></html>\n\nNote: Find all languages codes here.\nWe can also extend the use-case to define specific versions of a language, for instance, British English.\n<html lang=\"en-gb\"></html>\n\nIn any regular plain HTML website, we would add this tag to the HTML element. However, in the case of Next.js, we don't have direct access to it.\nSo to add this tag, we need to use the next.config.js file.\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n};\n\nIf your website supports multiple languages, you can even put various values in the locales array.\nThe default locales are then used to set the current one.\nYou can even use this config to set up custom domains, but we might dive into that separately.\nThere is an alternative way of adding a custom HTML tag if you want to override multiple HTML properties.\nInside your pages directory, you can add a _document.js file.\nThis page will override the default Next.js document.\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang='en'>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  );\n}\n\nAnd that's it, two different ways of adding the lang tag in Next.js.\nThank you for reading my blog.

Fast forward to today and you can do much more with JavaScript. When companies started adopting JavaScript, a standard document called ECMAScript standard was written by ECMA International organization to maintain a standard in the language. Theoretically JavaScript can also be called as ECMAScript.\nToday, JavaScript is not limited to the browser, you can write JavaScript on any device that has a JavaScript engine (A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code) Some of the popular JavaScript engines are\nV8 - used in chrome, Microsoft edge, Opera, Node.js etc.\nJavaScript for the browser\nPHP for web server\nSwift for IOS applications\netc.\nWith introduction of Node.js, JavaScript become a backend language as well. Node.js was built on top the v8 engine which already supported JavaScript. What makes Node.js standout is it's non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient, Node.js can asynchronously continue executing code while listening for other events.\nIf you are someone new to the world of programming, you could build full stack web applications with the knowledge of one language. Also front-end developers who primarily use JavaScript can work on the backend without learning a new language.\nFinally I want to leave this famous quote by Jeff Attwood also known as the Atwood's Law.\nAtwood's Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript",

Other developers use various cloud platforms so that they don’t need to worry about security logic, and these platforms help developers with most secure ways of authenticating users.\nWe are going to see how you can use Firebase auth service to secure your react APP.\nFirst you will need to set up our own Firebase project through the Firebase Console. To get started, navigate your browser to Firebase Console. Make sure you are logged into your Google account.\nNow, click on Add project and follow the simple instructions provided. Once presented with a dashboard, click on Authentication on the sidebar and click on Get Started to enable the module. Now you will be presented with various authentication options. Click on Email/Password, enable it, and save it. We will come back later, let create our react app first.\nNavigate to your terminal and use npx create-react-app appname to create a new react app.\nnpm install firebase react-router-dom react-firebase-hooks \nNow lets go back to the Firebase Console dashboard, click on Project Settings. Click on the third icon (</>) to configure our Firebase project for the web. Here you will see a config file. Copy the config. Create a new file in the src folder named firebase.js, import firebase modules, and paste the config file here.\nWith this on your react app you can now start to create login and signup forms and use the firebase authentication module.",

However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)\n\nI am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. \nIf you are a beginner, please don't use any kind of IDE.\n IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. \nIt is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. \nAs using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. \nSo you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. \nThis learning method is slow but very effective. \nAlthough you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. \nYou can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.💯",

          "description": "开源的无头Headless内容管理系统（CMS）列表中添加了一个新选项。它会是一个更好的无头 WordPress 替代品吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n自从一年多前发布首个测试版以来，作为无头内容管理系统（CMS），Payload 已经逐渐在 Web 开发社区中给人们留下了深刻印象。先做一些背景介绍，Payload 是专门为更简单地开发网站、Web 应用或原生native应用而量身定制的内容管理系统。\n\r\n最近，他们决定完全开源，现在，它已跻身 可用的最佳开源内容管理系统 之一。\n\r\n然而，这也带来了一些问题：他们会采用怎么样的商业模式？Payload 内容管理系统的计划是什么？下面，就让我们简要地看一下吧！\n\r\nPayload 为什么要开源？\n\r\n自 2021 年首次发布以来，Payload 已经收到了来自开源社区的许多贡献。正如 Payload 在他们 最近的公告 中所说，开源是一个重要的决定，它能够使项目能够达到的更高的高度，这是闭门造车做不到的。\n\r\n\n\r\n此外，这种开放性通常会增加开发者社区的信任。这种信任也会延伸到商业，自然而然地转而成为开发者最支持、最信任的平台。\n\r\n因此，Payload 正在切换到 MIT 许可证。这将允许任何人免费且不受限制地修改、分发和使用 Payload。\n\r\n然而，Payload 仍然需要资金流入才能持续运营。那么，这就引出了一个问题，Payload 将如何盈利呢？\n\r\nPayload 将如何盈利?\n\r\n与往常一样，Payload 需要一些财务支持才能维持运营。团队拿出了一个由两部分组成的计划，该计划既要为用户提供更多 以便利为中心convenience-focused的功能，又要为 自托管self-hosted 客户提供难以置信的灵活性。\n\r\n\n\r\n企业许可证\n\r\n此选项与其他开源 CMS 的软件服务极为相似。这些许可证将提供更高级的 SSO 选项，并为开发者保证 Payload 核心团队的响应时间。\n\r\n这些许可证应该对大公司有吸引力，尤其是那些需要最大程度可靠性的公司。\n\r\n云主机\n\r\n这个选项非常有吸引力，因为它结合了多种服务来创造最方便的体验。尽管传统托管仍然相当容易，但只要你为 Node 应用程序添加数据库、持久文件存储和其他基础设施，你就会面对四五个不同的服务，而这些服务都需要无缝协同工作。\n\r\n应该注意的是，这不是必需的，Payload 仍然鼓励用户托管他们的实例。这项服务只是消除了与托管相关的大量费用和挑战而已。\n\r\n截至目前，事情还没有敲定。但是，你可以关注 GitHub 上的讨论来跟踪事情的进展。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n作为一个新兴的 CMS 选项，很高兴看到 Payload 迈出了这一步，成为 WordPress 和其他选项的流行替代品。此外，在我看来，Payload 团队对他们的新业务模式充满信心，或许这预示着一个光明的未来（希望如此）。\n\r\n\r\nPayload 内容管理系统\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/payload-open-source/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "以下是切换到 Linux sudo 命令的五个安全原因。下载 sudo 参考手册获取更多技巧。\n\r\n\r\n在传统的 Unix 和类 Unix 系统上，新系统中存在的第一个同时也是唯一的用户是 root。使用 root 账户登录并创建“普通”用户。在初始化之后，你应该以普通用户身份登录。\n\r\n以普通用户身份使用系统是一种自我施加的限制，可以防止愚蠢的错误。例如，作为普通用户，你不能删除定义网络接口的配置文件或意外覆盖用户和组列表。作为普通用户，你无权访问这些重要文件，所以你无法犯这些错误。作为系统的实际所有者，你始终可以通过 su 命令切换为超级用户（root）并做你想做的任何事情，但对于日常工作，你应该使用普通账户。\n\r\n几十年来，su 运行良好，但随后出现了 sudo 命令。\n\r\n对于日常使用超级用户的人来说，sudo 命令乍一看似乎是多余的。在某些方面，它感觉很像 su 命令。例如：\n\r\n$ su root\r\n<输入密码>\r\n# dnf install -y cowsay\r\n\n\r\nsudo 做同样的事情：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install -y cowsay\r\n<输入密码>\r\n\n\r\n它们的作用几乎完全相同。但是大多数发行版推荐使用 sudo 而不是 su，甚至大多数发行版已经完全取消了 root 账户（LCTT 译注：不是取消，而是默认禁止使用 root 用户进行登录、运行命令等操作。root 依然是 0 号用户，依然拥有大部分系统文件和在后台运行大多数服务）。让 Linux 变得愚蠢是一个阴谋吗？\n\r\n事实并非如此。sudo 使 Linux 更加灵活和可配置，并且没有损失功能，此外还有 几个显著的优点。\n\r\n为什么在 Linux 上 sudo 比 root 更好？\n\r\n以下是你应该使用 sudo 替换 su 的五个原因。\n\r\n1. root 是被攻击确认的对象\n…",

          "description": "小米想要禁止用户提取 apk 文件，但被谷歌拒绝了\n\r\n根据 AOSP（Android 开源项目）上的讨论，小米工程师提议给安卓添加 SELinux 策略以禁止提取 apk 文件，让用户只能通过官方商店或授权网站下载应用，小米的理由是 apk 文件可能含有来自私有来源的数据，比如其中的图像可能会被其他人拿来重复使用。但谷歌拒绝了这一提议。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：突然觉得谷歌还是挺有底线的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开发者调查显示对区块链、加密货币和 NFT 有强烈兴趣\n\r\n根据对两万多名编程人员的调查，SlashData 的 2022 年度开发者调查显示，34% 的开发者表示正在学习加密货币知识，16% 的人表示正在参与加密货币项目；32% 接受调查的开发者表示在了解 NFT 相关知识，11% 的人正参与 NFT 项目。此外 30% 的人正在学习加密货币之外的区块链应用，但仅有 12% 在从事这些区块链项目。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：SlashData\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：抛开各种金融困境不说，我是坚定地认为区块链及加密货币必然有其存在价值，是为未来所打造的基础技术。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n将云计算引入机器人操作系统\n\r\n由于重量和功率要求，机器人的机载计算能力往往受到限制，它们也很少有硬件加速器，如 GPU、TPUS 或 FPGA。但许多机器人算法和最近的进展都得益于高端计算机和硬件加速器。伯克利人工智能研究实验室正在开发开源机器人操作系统 FogROS。他们设想使用云计算来加速缓慢的计算，可以使机器人在相同的时间内做更多的事情。他们已经开放了 FogROS 2 预览版。FogROS 2 将 SLAM 延迟降低了 50%，将抓取规划时间从 14 秒减少到 1.2 秒，并将运动规划速度提高了 28 倍，与替代方案相比 FogROS 2 将网络使用率降低了 3.8 倍。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Techcrunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：云计算是大脑，而这些机器人就是它的手臂，可以预期将来的机器人会更强大，但是我总有对这种有强大智能的机器人一些恐惧。",

Logitech ERGO K860\n电脑：\n主要使用 M1 Mini ，有时需要切换成 PC\nTL;DR\n最终选择方案：1(2) + b + 4\n经过亲身体验，键盘还是 HHKB 的手感最好，不忍割舍。左手可以搭配 Trackball 或者垫高的 Trackpad 来用最小的手部移动满足基础的指针需求，然后在需要更精准点击以及大量拖拽时可以使用右手的鼠标，考虑到右手的使用场景更少然后 Master3 有时会出现断连 /延迟 /滚轮方向不正确等问题，我选择了更稳定的有线方案 G502 。在需要切换桌面时，HHKB 和 Trackball 可以切换蓝牙，Trackpad 可以通过有线 /蓝牙来切换，右手 G502 就没办法了。\n推荐组合：\n组合一：1 + a + 4\nPROS:\n最原生的 M1 键鼠组合，基本需求一步到位，续航完美，有线可以减少延迟，touchID 极大提升输密码环节的使用体验，trackpad 的手势不必多说，用习惯了就离不开了,右手选择最稳定的 G502 。\nCONS:\n键盘敲击手感一般，手腕无法垫高失去保护，长时间使用不舒服。多桌面支持不佳，只能用蓝牙 /有线来每次进行手动切换。\n组合二：2 + b + 4\nPROS：\n最适合 VIM 用户的组合，键盘不必多说，手感 /布局都是精心设计，长期码字手感顺滑，配上统一高度并且能最小移动手部的 Trackball ，可以在需要精准指针操作的时候最大程度减少撕裂感。两者都支持多平台，HHKB 可以通过有线 /多个蓝牙，Trackball 可以通过接收器 /蓝牙来进行切换。\nCONS：\nHHKB 如果不是有线连接的话无法唤醒 MAC ，KENSINGTON 的接收器十分不稳定，经常断连，使用蓝牙的话延迟严重。\n组合三：（ 2 ） + c + 3\nPROS：\n罗技工程学组合，一个接收器可以让键鼠同时丝滑使用，K860 的分离式设计和碗托的设计让人爱不释手，Master3 和 Mac 的适配也很完美。两者都支持多桌面，不过由于 K860 不支持 flow ，所以还是需要手动点击切换，不过相比起其他组合已经是最快捷的桌面切换方式了。\nCONS：\nLOGI OPTIONS 垃圾，K860 的敲击感一般，而且带小键盘导致右手鼠标必须离远使用，因为 Master3 并不适配左手。替代方案是左手使用 Trackpad 或者 Trackball ，考虑到键盘高度，Trackball 最适配。\n以上只是个人的使用体验，每个人都有适合自己的搭配，我比较爱折腾所以给大家一些参考，欢迎大家给出自己的方案。",

          "description": "theme: v-green\nhighlight: atom-one-dark\n我正在参加「初夏创意投稿大赛」详情请看：初夏创意投稿大赛\n前言\n上一篇我们通过Listener获取触控点的位置作为贝塞尔曲线的控制点，实现曲线的交互式绘制。不过，上一篇有个缺陷，控制点绘制完成后只能撤销，没法修改，如果要调整绘制的图形的话会非常麻烦，这一篇我们来实现控制点的拖拽式移动，动态调整位置来调整绘制的图形。\n实现逻辑\n上一篇的主要代码我们不做更改，主要是需要实现控制点的拖拽式移动，移动过程中动态绘制新的曲线。不过由于绘制过程中不能同时移动点，因此需要有个完成绘制的控制，完成绘制后才支持拖拽控制点。拖拽控制点实现这里有两个主要逻辑：\n控制点的命中判断：即拖拽开始时判断哪个控制点被命中，需要移动。\n监听触控位置的移动过程：移动过程中动态绘制新的图形，以便直接看到对应的效果。\n控制点的命中判断在完成绘制后，首先需要监听触控按下事件，看看触控点是否覆盖了某个控制点的触控响应范围，同时对于距离较近的点，可能会同时命中多个点的触控响应范围，这个时候需要取距离最近的那个点。对于触控范围，我们定义为每个触控点的周边10个像素点。命中触控点的实现代码如下：\nint checkPointToMove(Offset pressedPoint) {\n    // 控制点非空才查找\n    if (points.isNotEmpty) {\n      var pointsToCheck = [];\n      final maxDistance = 10.0;\n      // 查找触控响应范围内的控制点\n      for (Offset p in points) {\n        if ((p.dx - pressedPoint.dx).abs() \n移动过程的处理就比较简单了，我们已经找到了命中的控制点，那就在触控位置移动监听响应方法onPointerMove中更新控制点位置，并重新绘制即可，代码如下，其中indexOfPointToMove是一个状态变量，即找到的控制点下标：\nonPointerMove: ((event) {\n  if (indexOfPointToMove != -1) {\n    points[indexOfPointToMove] = event.localPosition;\n    setState(() {});\n  }\n}),\n\n应用\n逻辑完成了，我们就来做一个绘制应用吧。考虑端午节快到了，我们尝试来绘制一个粽子的线条画看看。下面是调整前后的对比效果以及调整过程的动图，可以看到，调整后的还是更像粽子一些。\n\n\n总结\n本篇介绍了如何通过拖拽调整贝塞尔曲线绘制的控制点来调整图形的绘制，实际上很多绘图都可能用到拖拽式的控制点位的调整，比如电子围栏的设置。实际上主要的代码是判断触控位置命中了具体哪个控制点。本篇代码已经上传至：绘图相关代码。\n我是岛上码农，微信公众号同名，这是Flutter 入门与实战的专栏文章，提供体系化的 Flutter 学习文章。对应源码请看这里：Flutter 入门与实战专栏源码。如有问题可以加本人微信交流，微信号：island-coder。\n👍🏻：觉得有收获请点个赞鼓励一下！\n🌟：收藏文章，方便回看哦！\n💬：评论交流，互相进步！",

Instead of opting for a spherical shape that comes with the Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod Mini, or even the rounded rectangular look of the Google Nest Audio device, a sketch shows what appears to be a speaker with a sloped top and a wide base.\nOnline records show that Comcast first filed for the patent last year, but it didn’t get approved until April 2022. As seen in the sketch, the device seems to have playback controls on the side of the speaker, with an additional button and a small stand on the bottom. \nImage: Comcast via USPTO\n      The smart speaker...\n  \nContinue reading…",

The page for the Retro 35’s crowdfunding campaign is very careful not to mention the name of Apple’s classic computer, but it’s drawn some very obvious inspiration, from the beige color scheme down to the placement of the disk drive. The device is eventually set to retail for $49, with Indiegogo “early bird” pricing starting at $25. \nAs increasing numbers of phone manufacturers have stopped shipping charging bricks with their devices, aftermarket chargers are becoming more popular.

The fashion brand previously collaborated with the virtual world for more short-lived experiences, like the surreal Gucci Garden from last year, and is now releasing a more persistent space called Gucci Town.
