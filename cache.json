          "description": "Apple Watch Series 7 是近年变化最大的一代 Apple Watch，也是变化没那么大的一代。变化之大在于，Apple Watch Series 7 是继 Apple Watch Series 4 之后设计改动最大的一代：屏幕更大、边框更窄，还有全新配色的表壳；说它变化不大，是因为相比老款，这代产品几乎没有新的硬件与配套功能。\n颜色方面，不锈钢和钛金属版本的表款与之前相比没有什么变化，铝金属表款的配色则有了全新的 5 种选项，分别为午夜色、星光色、绿色、新款蓝色和红色，部分配色与 iPhone 13 以及新款 iPad mini 类似。\n\n比如午夜色表壳，仔细观察会有一种极深的蓝色的质感，绿色表壳颜色偏深，不仔细看的话反而会有一种接近黑色的质感，也能比较好地融入日常搭配。\n左：午夜色表壳 | 右：绿色表壳绿色表壳\n星光色表壳则与 iPad mini 的星光色类似，相比之前的银色表款色彩的层次表现更加出色，不同光线之下可能会有金色或者粉色的呈现效果。\n星光色表壳\n蓝色和红色是经过重新设计的 2 款配色。其中蓝色相比之前的版本颜色更浅更亮，有种更加轻快活泼的感觉；新款的红色给人的感觉又会更加「深沉」。\n蓝色表壳红色表壳\n戴上 Apple Watch Series 7，这块「全面屏」带来的视觉冲击感受还是足够让人印象深刻：紧贴表壳边缘的(轮廓表盘) 时标刻度，加上因为光线反射带来的「曲面」显示效果，这块 Apple Watch 给人的第一印象可以用「惊艳」来形容。\n轮廓表盘\n没错，这块手表的显示屏幕依然是一块直屏，利用弧形表镜产生的光线反射现象，通过侧面观察，能够看到时标刻度浮在屏幕边缘，让人产生这是一块「曲面屏」的错觉。\n\n如果不是放在一起比较，我不太能感受得到 41 毫米的新表款相比 40 毫米的老表款大了多少，毕竟 Apple Watch Series 7 的高度和宽度仅比之前多了 1 毫米 (41 毫米表款)。不过，如果将 2 款产品放在一起，Apple Watch Series 7 的「全面屏」会给人一种手表「大了不少」的错觉。\nApple Watch Series 7 / SE / Series 3\n除了上面提到的 41 毫米表款，根据官网给出的规格参数，45 毫米版本表款的高度比老款多了 1 毫米，2 个尺寸的表款厚度均为 10.7 毫米，与前代产品没有差别。\n重量方面，铝金属、不锈钢、钛金属 3 种表壳表款的重量均比前代产品更重。其中，41 毫米版本的 3 种表款分别重了 1.5 克、2.6 克、2.4 克，45 毫米版本的 3 种表款分别重了 2.3 克、4.4 克、3.8 克。理论上看，新款 Apple Watch 的重量变化几乎可以忽略不计，也与我的佩戴感受相当；不过，对于手表重量的感知程度因人而异，在意重量不妨等到 10 月 15 日手表上市之后去店里戴戴看。\nApple Watch Series 7 配备的同样是一块 LTPO 全天候视网膜屏，亮度与前代产品一致可达 1000 尼特。不同的是在非抬手亮屏状态下，新款手表的显示亮度有了显著提升，表盘上的信息变得更好读了。根据官网介绍，非抬手亮屏状态的亮度最高提升了 70%。不过，目前来看，我对于息屏显示的亮度提升没有特别大的感知，需要更长时间的使用与体验，观察这项功能提升的实际效果。\n息屏显示状态\n性能方面，在 Apple Watch Series 7 上使用 App 反应同样十分灵敏，各种 App 的打开速度、交互反馈都很及时，但与 Apple Watch Series 6 相比，没有明显变化。\n有趣的是，根据官方数据，Apple Watch Series 7 搭载的是一枚 64 位双核 S7 芯片，速度最快比搭载 S5 芯片的 Apple Watch SE 快了 20%；而 S6 芯片的运行速度，根据此前给出的数据，同样比 S5 芯片最快提升了 20%，似乎间接证明了 S7 芯片在性能方面与 S6 芯片相比没有提升。\n结合 Apple Watch Series 7 具有更大的显示屏幕和更高的息屏显示亮度的特性，且续航时间相比前代产品没有变化，S7 芯片应该是专注于在能耗与功耗方面进行优化，以抵消这部分特性带来的额外功耗。\n由于拿到 Apple Watch Series 7 的时间很短，对于续航、充电速度以及新功能等方面的体验，我们还没能实现完整的测试和体验，也欢迎你通过 网站 / 客户端、公众号、微博 继续关注少数派，第一时间获取我们后续的完整体验内容。\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "「博士」「读博」对于一些人好像是一个模糊而遥远的词语。很多人对于博士的认知大多停留在一些新闻或者社交平台的信息上，形成了很多或好或坏的刻板印象。大家对于博士为什么要读博大多只是基于这些刻板印象的猜测。学生在被问到是否读博时，大多是觉得遥远所以立马否认，也有盲目立刻回答一定要读博。\n那么博士们或者博士生们为什么要读博？我这次邀请了七位在读或者毕业的博士，来一起聊聊他们为什么要读博。希望可以让大家对于「博士」和「读博」有一些打破刻板印象的认识，也给那些想知道「读博」是怎么回事的学生一点启发，更希望给处在徘徊边缘的朋友们一些做决定的参考。\n\n这次邀请的七位，专业涵盖了文科、理工科、医科和商科，但是不一定覆盖到所有典型的专业。我只问了三个简单的问题：\n\n👀 为什么想读博？\n🧐 怎样走上了读博这条路？\n🧠 读博之后心态有什么变化吗？\n\n他们有些是当面和我聊了这些问题，也有远程语音和我谈了谈，还有文字回复了我这三个问题的答案。并不像一些刻板印象描绘的那样，他们有雄心壮志意气风发的时候，也有迷茫和不顺利时候。看完他们的答案，会发现「博士」和「读博」并不是什么遥远的词语，某种程度上，博士们也都是普通人。\n他们的回答有共同点也有个人的特殊情况，不代表所有情况，仅供有想了解读博的朋友进行参考。如果有想聊聊自己的想法的，也非常欢迎分享。\n\n01 从独角兽企业到软件工程博士\n\n📖：CS 软件工程\n🎓：博士在读\n\n👀 环境要求我必须进步\n那年，企业来我们实验室招人，我还是一个本科生，但却给了我和研究生同样的薪酬。于是我就放弃了读研的打算。\n后来，我进入了博士如云的 AI 独角兽企业，也逐渐发现了自己和一些博士大牛的差距，尤其是思维上的差距。但同时，我也发现了和一些有着博士头衔，但实力却不一定如我的同事。我陷入了思考。\n最后是有一个契机，在我离开公司后按照协议一段时间内不能从事同行业的工作…",

          "description": "极客时间四周年的时候搞了个活动，让作者们都写一点最近的思考，我想了想，就写了一些关于“眼界”的。这个话题其实我以前也有写到，但是随着阅历的增加，这个词正变得越来越重要。我写的那几段话是：\n“每个人都有自己不同的能力和特质，有的是先天具备的，比如有的人天生就记忆力出色；有的是后天努力的，比如通过坚持不懈的奋斗做成一件大事。可是，有的特质却既非先天可具备，又非后天可努力得到，在我们朴素的教育背景中，它们往往总被忽略。它们的其中一个，就是眼界。在投资领域，大概有这样一句话，把一个问题如果放到十年、二十年的维度上去看，问题就会简单很多。倒不是说要宣扬佛系心态，而是说，要有够大的眼界，能够‘忽略’掉那些纷纷扰扰的细枝末节，而专注于主要的因素。”\n\n\n\n\n\n“毕业工作以来，随着经验的积累，我的心态也在不断变化。在我刚踏入职场的时候，我对自己特别自信，我相信自己具备足够的天赋能够成功；几年之后，我觉得自己通过坚持和努力能够做到自己梦想的事情；而现在，我越来越觉得，眼界，似乎是它才能决定一个人长久职业发展的天花板。一些人能够做到足够大的事情，一个必不可少的原因是他们其实本来就已经站得够高，本来就见过很多世面，有了足够开阔的眼界，毕竟单靠天赋和努力，再怎样潜心奋斗，螺丝钉也不能成为决定整个机器运转的关键零件。”\n\n\n\n\n\n“而有意思的是，所谓眼界，是需要不断去新的领域和环境尝试、经历，才能慢慢开阔的，而一个人愿意去做出尝试的意愿，恰恰又是从很小时候就培育的心态所决定的，那是不是可以说，一个人的天花板在哪里，对于这样的问题，很可能从小、从成长环境，甚至从父母那里，就能找到这个答案呢？”\n\n\n\n\n我不知道你怎样想，在我的认知里，至少对于绝大多数人来说，我从来不相信一个人的未来是无限可能的，但是我却有无法说出，到底所谓的天花板，所谓的边界，到底是谁限定的。后来我慢慢感受到了，可能这个边界，就是每个人的父母、每个人的生活环境所限定的。\n简单来说，人活得越久，就越能看到自己父母的影子。我最近忽然发现，我的性格、我的长处，我的短处，我对问题的思考方法，我对于某些现状的不安和挣扎，甚至我在某些问题上的软弱和放弃，以及不够豁达的气度，都在我的父母身上找到了影子。\n我不知你有没有这样的想法，这确实有点让我感到灰心丧气。如果一个人的努力让自己成长，但是却在这个过程中慢慢看到了自己难以跳出的边界，这很难不对自己保持希望的心态有所打击。但人的成长可能就是这样的一个过程，每个人都一样，你不可能永远都是充满希望的潜质新人。\n稍稍思考一下原因，也许能找到一些合理的解释。比方说，如果从小父母身体力行，就都是对细节把握得扎实，做事认真严谨，甚至完美主义，那么很可能他们的孩子也具备了这样优秀的特质，但另一方面，也很有可能这样的人不容易拿得起放得下，无法豁达地生活。无论好坏，这样的特质可以说是深深地镌刻在性格里的，是真正决定一个人可能性上限的，是非常非常难以改变的。\n当然，话说回来，每个人都有自己与众不同的小倔强，这个倔强可能让自己在这边界所确定的大框架下，有一点自己小小的特立独行。兴许，每个人“应当”做的，就是尽力去认识清楚自己究竟是怎样一个人，然后才看看什么事、哪些事才是自己适合做的。\n那么，怎么才能够认识清楚自己呢？我觉得这就要回到一开始的那个关键词——“眼界”上面来了。这就好像当人只待在地球上的时候，是很难准确说出地球的形状的，只有到了太空，才能看到地球是球形的。眼界越开阔，就越能够认清自己。我觉得这是眼界给每个人自己带来的最大价值。",

          "description": "一场激烈的战役正进行到最紧张的时刻。遮天蔽日的炮火下，敌我双方死伤相枕，战场上僵持不下。谁能想到，有一个小小的苹果居然会被战史所记录。\n这是1952年秋季上甘岭战役中的一幕。  \n\n战役打响前，美军第8集团军司令范弗里特狂妄至极，打算以牺牲200人左右的代价，在5天之内轻松拿下上甘岭地区的597.9高地和537.7高地。实际上，范弗里特确实有“自信”的资本，他们有足够的弹药保障和航空支援，这在战场上占绝对优势。\n彼时，“联合国军”将300余门大炮直接拉到了阵地之下，万弹齐发，地动山摇。另外他们还有大量的坦克和飞机支援，战场炮火的密度创历史空前。据记载，面积仅为3.7平方公里的上甘岭地区每秒就要承受敌军6发炮弹，每平方米落弹76枚，这在人类战争史上是极为罕见的。整个上甘岭阵地烈焰如海、硝烟缭绕。面对敌人如此高强度的狂轰滥炸，我军当然伤亡惨重。一时取得胜利的“联合国军”觉得战斗马上就可以结束，可他们万万没想到，好几个星期过去了，志愿军还是无法撼动。\n\n是什么保存了有生力量？\n在武器装备上明显处于劣势的志愿军，创造性地将坑道作业发挥到极致，有效地削弱了敌人空炮火力的杀伤效果。面对敌人一次次的疯狂进攻，英勇顽强的志愿军没有畏惧，一次次将其打退。可更要命的问题接踵而至：坑道里的志愿军们不得不时常面临缺水缺粮缺弹药的残酷境遇，补给是个大难题。\n\n要知道现代战争是立体战争，战争不仅在前方打，也在后方打。后方的战争，不仅决定了前方战争的规模，而且也会关乎前方战争的成败。“联合国军”当然深谙这一点，他们一方面对志愿军疯狂进攻，一方面用绵密的炮火切断了志愿军在上甘岭阵地的所有后勤补给线。\n前方需要什么，后勤就运输什么。为了保障好前线官兵，时任15军军长的秦基伟下令要不惜一切代价向坑道运送物资。就这样，火线运输员一批接着一批，冒着敌人的炮火，前仆后继地穿梭于通往坑道的路上。可即便如此，能够运送到…",

          "description": "中国文艺网时评丨从艺先做人是文艺工作者的终身必修课\n\n\n近日，钢琴家李云迪因涉嫌嫖娼被北京朝阳警方依法行政拘留，曾经享誉国际的“钢琴王子”如今踩踏了道德底线与法律红线，其行径遭到了社会和大众的一致谴责，同时引起了行业深思。大众谴责的不仅是身为“明星”的李云迪行为失范，更是身为“艺术家”的李云迪德不配位。文艺工作者可以“跨界”但不能“越线”。作为当红的顶流文艺工作者，相较于娱乐明星拥有更高的公共权威，艺术家的价值观念、审美情趣对受众的影响更为深远。“从艺先做人”、重“修心”早已是艺术家的必修之功课、终身之功课，也是艺术之所以成为艺术、启迪心灵的内在动力。人们常常将艺术家的技艺与品德相联系，艺术家一旦有不良行为，对受众主流价值观的解构程度，以及社会良好风气的破坏程度十分巨大。\n“艺术家”“天才少年”“钢琴王子”李云迪跌落神坛，令人分外扼腕，冷静分析德不配位的深层原因，与其以身体的“欲望”取代精神的“愉悦”，以名利的追逐取代人格的修养，以华丽人设取代“道器”的修持，以本能的放纵取代理性的克制有很大关系。李云迪少年成名，年仅18岁时便已获得第14届肖邦国际钢琴比赛冠军，次年便登上央视春晚舞台，成为家喻户晓的钢琴艺术家，近年来，李云迪更是频频“跨界”成为了综艺节目的常客。但李云迪的专业水准并未随着名气的增长而精进，相反，李云迪的演奏状态持续下降，在公开演奏会中失误频频，“钢琴家”的头衔似乎成为其娱乐明星身份的精美“人设”。艺术家“跨界”无可厚非，但流量应与技艺相匹配，名气应与品德旗鼓相当，秉承艺术家的身份却一味沉湎于追逐热钱，不仅是对个人精神的蚕食，同时也是对文艺工作者群体公信力的消减；而其跨越法律与道德红线的嫖娼行为，不仅是对社会核心价值观的一种亵渎，更是对公序良俗的一种践踏。\n李云迪事件的警示意义远远超出其自身，对于文艺工作者的规范必须各方联合发力。首先，文艺工作者自身要汲取教训、引以为戒，真正做到德才兼备、才高行洁，耐得住文艺工作“高处不胜寒”的寂寞。因为文艺工作者的言行直接影响着大众价值观与审美情趣的塑造，特别是在网络媒介生态下，文艺工作者的言行举止都将被媒介放大，严以修身、知行合一和引领示范是广大文艺工作者安身立命的必修课。其次，规范各文化企业和社交平台对明星艺人的曝光范围，要划定和提升曝光门槛，逐步建立专业与道德“档案”，专注宣传专业精深、德艺双馨的文艺工作者。对于以“艺术家”头衔博眼球、赚快钱而放松其道德品质与专业修养的明星艺人，我们不能为其慷慨提供舞台和平台，不能为了市场飘红而放弃立场底线，对于一手赚钱一手推墙者必须予以严惩和打击，守护好文艺界的正气清风，才是文化产业良性循环的正道。第三，各级文联协会要履行职能，发挥引导作用，加大培训力度，加强行业风气监管，既要敢于亮剑作为，也要善于引导示范，努力营造积极健康的文艺生态。总之，只有不断加强法纪教育和法律文化普及，提升道德修为与审美修养，文艺工作者才能让自己具备引领时代风尚的资格与能力。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国文艺网\n点击下载\n10 个回答，查看全部。\n中国音乐家协会钢琴考级可以弹中央音乐学院的曲子么？\n作为一个天津音乐学院钢琴系的学生，想要做钢琴家教，如何能找到人脉介绍学生？",

          "description": "秋~这次我介绍一个连菩萨都喜欢不愿意离开的地方……\n「塔公」一个非常平凡的名字，除非你知道这个地方，否则它可能吸引不了你半点兴趣。但是相信我，等你看完我这篇推荐之后，你一定会牢牢记住这个地方。\n看字不如看图，放几张图片上来，过过眼瘾先。\n\n塔公的夏季是这样的：\n\n\n\n塔公的秋季是这样的：\n\n\n\n\n怎么样，是不是挺亮眼的？有没有望一眼就种草的感觉？是的，若干年前，我和朋友们就是被这样的美景所吸引，开始关注了这个地方。之后，我们还听说了一个传奇的故事。\n在1380多年前（贞观十四年），唐太宗李世民将李氏册封为「文成公主」，并许配给了吐蕃王松赞干布。次年（公元641年），文成公主出发前往吐蕃。她从长安（今西安）出发，途径西宁，翻阅日月山，长途跋涉最终到达吐蕃都城逻些（今西藏拉萨）。\n当时文成公主随着部队携带了一尊释迦牟尼十二岁等身像，当他们行进到这里的时候，发现这座佛像无论如何都抬不动了。后来有人指点，说菩萨喜欢这个地方，他不愿意离开。文成公主便请人用当地的材料又建造了一尊佛像留在这个地方，释迦牟尼的等身像才又能移动了，最后由文成公主带到了吐蕃，供奉在小昭寺，后来又请到了大昭寺至今。\n而那个菩萨不愿意离开的地方，人们便给他取了个名字，叫做「塔公」。而且在那里建造了一座寺庙供奉着留在那里的菩萨像，并将那个寺庙叫做「塔公寺」。\n\n现在，塔公被称为塔公乡，隶属于四川甘孜藏族自治州，位于甘孜州首府康定的西北方向。是的，就是那首《康定情歌》中的康定。虽然说这首歌的来源有多种说法，但歌中的那座「溜溜的城」指的就是这个康定城无疑。\n塔公乡距离成都市区只有370多公里，距离康定市区仅100多公里，交通极为方便。\n塔公草原\n塔公草原是甘孜州最著名的草原，海拔3730米，面积约712平方公里。塔公草原上的草原、河流、民居、雪山、寺庙组成了一幅含有浓重藏族特色的画卷。不管是从G318国道从新都桥前来，还是在翻越折多山垭口后从康定机场方向都可以前往，沿途有机会可以看到四川省的最高峰，海拔7556米称为蜀山之王的贡嘎主峰，还可以看到其它十多座雪山，其中距离最近的就是雅拉雪山。\n\n雅拉雪山\n海拔5884米，在塔公草原上极易见到，形似一朵莲花，是我见过最漂亮的雪山。\n雅拉雪山在藏语里的全称为「东方白牦牛山」，是康巴地区著名的神山之一，是一座终年积雪真正的雪山（只有一年四季都有积雪的山才被真正认为是雪山）。\n雅拉雪山曾有几只登山队想要登顶，但至今未有一人成果，所以她还是一座「处女峰」。\n\n\n\n木雅金塔\n行走在塔公草原之上，最吸引人的就是木雅金塔，木雅金塔是由红教竹庆寺多杰扎西活佛在1997年捐资建造的。金塔使用了一百多公斤（也称八十公斤）的黄金。建成开光之时，据说天空出现五彩祥云，七色光环。\n佛塔内供奉有释迦牟尼佛、观世音菩萨、文殊菩萨等八大菩萨和十八罗汉像等，还藏有诸多佛教经文等。围绕金塔修建有470个转经筒，佛塔158座。\n\n这座寺庙是少有的可以进入观赏并且允许拍照（在佛堂内也可以拍照）的地方之一，喜欢拍照的朋友千万不要错过。（抱歉，我在佛堂里面还是不敢举起相机，所以没有照片）。\n\n*提醒：请顺时针观赏，顺时针转动转经筒。\n相关联的新都桥\n你或许听过一个说法：摄影家的天堂——新都桥。没错，新都桥距离塔公乡只有40公里，不到一个小时的车程，下面这张航拍的图片中这条路，便是通往新都桥的S215省道，旁边的这条清晰见底的是查垭沟。\n\n\n如果你的时间足够，在游玩塔公的时候，也顺道去往新都桥吧，也一定不会让你失望。有机会我也会像大家介绍介绍新都桥的。\n航拍视频\n这里有我上次去川西拍摄的一些航拍镜头，中间有不少是塔公的画面，大伙可以欣赏一下。\n川西航拍视频记录\n最后，给点旅行方面的提醒吧。\n\n塔公地处高原，路途中最高处折多山垭口海拔达到了4298米，塔公平均海拔3700米，要注意高反。\n在高原上切记防寒保暖，不要感冒，非必要不洗澡。不要快速移动，不要做体力活。\n备好常用和高原药品，高原药物对有些人的效果显著。\n有呼吸道和心脏部位疾病的人前往高海拔地区之前建议先询问医生并征得同意。\n高原上气温比低海拔地区要低得多，春秋季一定要穿好厚实的保暖衣，夏季也要准备外套。\n从成都出发可以走高速先到康定，然后再从康定到塔公比较节约时间。除非特意想要自驾G318，或者要前往泸定等地。\n康定有机场，可以直飞拉萨、重庆、杭州和成都，但班次较少。\n\n好了，塔公就介绍到这里吧，希望大家能够喜欢。\n以上，谢邀，谢阅！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n海水茶杯鱼\n点击下载\n67 个回答，查看全部。\n秋天去日本旅游是种怎样的体验？\n秋天去成都旅游是种怎样的体验？",

          "description": "6个月在轨驻留与3个月相比，时间长度就是他们最大的挑战。\n相比于神舟十二号航天员在轨驻留3个月，这次神舟十三号的在轨驻留时间直接增加了一倍。在空间微重力的影响下，宇航员骨量的减少、肌肉的萎缩以及神经系统的弱化，这三个影响会放大一倍。三名航天员要在太空停留6个月是为了考核、验证目前所采取的抵抗措施是否有效。\n未来从神舟十四号开始，要实现中国空间站不间断有航天员驻留。这样的话，空间站正常的乘组轮换将会是半年一轮换。目前，只有验证这些措施有效，才敢进入一个正常的运营阶段。\n此次航天飞行过程中，三名宇航员将进行两到三次出舱活动，这也是为了进一步夯实航天员出舱活动方面的能力和技术。出舱活动本身的技术较为复杂，要求较高。虽然我国载人航天已进行过多次出舱活动，但此次出舱活动将进行更为复杂的操作任务。\n此次飞行任务中航天员要安装能够将大小机械臂连接在一起的适配器以及悬挂系统，这是一个非常复杂的过程。对标国外，出舱已经成为一个完全常规的操作，所以在这方面还要进一步夯实技术基础。\n神舟十三号载人飞行任务是空间站关键技术验证阶段第六次飞行任务，也是该阶段最后一次飞行任务。飞行任务中将开展机械臂辅助舱段转位、手控遥操作等空间站组装建造关键技术试验，这项技术对于未来可靠建造空间站非常重要。这将会是航天员在太空中很有挑战的一项任务，要严密地在轨监视机械臂辅助进行转位的状态。\n径向对接，要求更严，中国是第一次这样做。\n不同于以往的神舟系列飞船采取的前、后两个方向停靠空间站，按计划，神舟十三号飞船入轨后，将采用自主快速交会对接模式，对接于天和核心舱径向端口，与天和核心舱及天舟二号、天舟三号货运飞船形成组合体。\n那么，径向停靠和前、后两种停靠方式有何不同？神舟飞船进入轨道以后要和空间站进行对接，对接的过程如果两者在同一轨道上，只是前后位置不一样，它是一个稳定的位置关系。由于轨道动力学的特点，如果飞船是从下方去接近空间站，就意味着飞船和空间站处在不同高度，处在不同轨道上。它的位置关系不是稳定的，相对于前后向对接，这种对接要求更严格，对时间的把握要更准确。中国第一次这样做，所以有一定难度。\n为什么要抛弃前后向对接而采用更加复杂的径向对接？因为空间站不可能所有的对接口都在前向和后向，尤其是未来基本上后向对接口会长期被天舟货运飞船占用。而且未来如果要实现中国航天员在太空不间断驻留，就意味着前一个乘组完成任务以后并不能直接返回地球，而是等后一个乘组来了以后，他们在轨进行任务交接，前一个乘组才能返回地球。这就意味着，短时间要有六个人两艘飞船对接到空间站上。前后向对接口可能已经被占用的情况下，只能选择径向对接口。这是未来空间站建设必须要掌握的技术。\n对比神舟十二号载人飞行任务，虽然说大的任务表面上和神舟十二号相似，但是神舟十三号的每一项任务其实更有技术含量，难度更高，更有挑战性。\n女航天员要首次进驻中国空间站。\n航天员王亚平将成为首次进驻中国空间站的中国女航天员，她也将成为中国首位实施出舱活动的女航天员。\n空间站的功能主要是进行各类科学研究，在科学研究层面，航天医学是这些研究中的重要项目。航天医学中既有对男性的研究也有对女性的研究。女航天员的存在，也是空间站运营的需求。由于长期处于封闭空间，男女搭配对于解决很多心理问题有好处。有女性航天员存在，也有助于研究未来更长时间的太空飞行中航天员的心理问题。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国航天科工\n点击下载\n371 个回答，查看全部。\n神舟十二号航天员开展中国空间站首次出舱活动，主要完成哪些任务？长时间舱外作业有哪些难度和危险？\n中国新一代载人飞船试验船返回舱开舱，舱里都带了些啥？下次你还希望可能带些啥？",

          "description": "近年来，一些艺人仗着粉丝和市场，屡屡顶风违纪，成为社会公序良俗的破坏者和疮疤毒瘤。事实证明，抵制这些劣迹艺人，光靠温馨提示般的行业自律和呼吁倡议，力度已经远远不够，必须各方联合发力，架好带电“高压线”，长出锋利的“牙齿”，方可奏效。\n首先，要划定和提升行业准入门槛，建立完善退出机制。文娱行业或视听行业是生产精神食粮的行业，行业的从业人员素质决定了产品的整体质量，从业人员的审美导向影响着消费者的价值取向。可以说，有什么样的人品就会有什么样的作品，有什么样的立场就会有什么样的市场，有什么样的素质就会有什么样的品质。但是，当下文娱行业或视听行业准入门槛很低，致使从业者泥沙俱下、良莠不齐。应该尽快建立文娱产业的准入门槛，更要建立完善退出机制，对于违法乱纪、越过底线者，及时、随时做出反应，拿出办法，有效清理。\n 其次，要从侧重结果管理转为侧重过程管理。抵制劣迹艺人的频繁出现，还需多方联合发力，变事后处置为事前和事中监管，从侧重结果管理转为侧重过程管理，从而在抓早和抓小中做好预防工作。一部作品创作前期对参与创作艺人的道德法纪把关和行为评估很有必要，在创作中期对多头轧戏、乱改剧本、态度傲慢等问题的监管同样不可或缺，在创作后期更应针对不合适的内容及宣发及时调整，对明星团队和粉丝互撕等恶性行为及时介入。这样可以有效避免创作投入和社会资源的浪费，更可以最大程度规避对文艺生态可能带来的伤害。\n再次，要从源头根本加强管控力度。劣迹艺人之所以能被粉丝们前呼后拥，离不开资本与平台的炒作，拉踩引战、攀比炫富、人肉搜索、刷榜控评等现象，归根结底都是资本追求增值的手段。斩断资本推手，管住无良平台，取消劣迹艺人表演的空间，划出平台生存的底线和红线，那么劣迹艺人的影响力和破坏力自然就会灰飞烟灭。\n最后，要强化艺人的职业教育。一些从业人员政治素养不高、法律意识淡薄、道德观念滑坡，违法失德言行之所以时有发生，与职业教育的长期忽略和不够全面也不无关系。不少艺人在职前教育阶段就存在只重专业训练、轻思想道德引领的问题，在职后教育阶段又缺乏正确的行业引领与规范，导致浮躁、拜金，只认流量和钱，心口不一和知行错位现象比较普遍。要从内心深处改变，职前和职后的培训教育必须加强，而且要划出底线和高线，打通培训和监管之间的壁障，让培训和监管“长牙”“带电”，不能流于形式，不能走过场，不能一味“温良恭俭让”。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国文艺网\n点击下载\n3085 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价宋冬野发布5月9日新版《郭源潮》？\n如何评价网易云下架宋冬野除《安和桥北》和新歌《郭源潮》外歌曲？",

          "description": "国产游戏《仙剑奇侠传 7》已发售，你的体验如何？ \n知乎的各位朋友大家好，感谢知乎的邀请，分享我对《仙剑奇侠传七》想法。\n\n\n《仙剑奇侠传七》的目标\n在立项之初说过仙七的创作目标之一，是想给玩家类似当年仙三的感觉，意思是“游历六界“。七代故事舞台跨人魔神三界，和明庶门、天师门、仙霞派等新老仙门，主角群都是年轻有为的新人物，也根据剧情需要有几位前作人物以大佬身份登场提携后辈。九泉中尚未登场的炎波、照胆、春滋、毒瘴等将一次呈现。可以说这是一部继往开来、新老融合，进一步延伸且整合世界观的作品。\n\n\n\n\n\n仙剑七之后，我们除了继续做下一代之外，还会推出多部长篇漫画来扩充和补全仙剑系列的人和事，从更多不同的视角和时间线向大家介绍仙剑世界。\n\n\n格物致知\n情与义是仙剑的情感核心，不同于欧美的个人英雄主义，我们中国人主张的是团队合作的力量，所以仙剑的故事向来是群像，过去回合制适合团队作战，改成ARPG之后，如何也能做出多主角并肩作战的感觉就成了我们要攻克的难题，虽然这在国外游戏并非新鲜事，但目前国内单机比较少见，而且多做一个可操作战斗的主角意味要多一倍这部分的投入，有可能是个吃力但不一定讨好的道路，而且我们过去没做过。但是我们认为这样能更好的体现伙伴的感觉，和避免玩家从头到尾只能操作一名主角的单调，所以还是咬牙朝这个坑跳下去。\n\n\n\n\n\n不同主角的打法设计，如何流畅的切换角色，男女主角合击等，要从一张白纸开始积累经验，总要跨出第一步。法乎其上，得乎其中，现在我们也建立起了一套多角色ARPG系统，也许还不完美，但是我们会根据玩家的反馈继续提高。\n\n\n跳既是坑\n跳，又是另一个坑。为了提供探索乐趣，这代地图刻意做的较大，地形起伏也复杂。加入自由跳跃之后场景测试修改的负担大增，而且是跳这么高，跑这么快的。开发途中我们一度遇到困难而纠结，但是这样能让玩家玩跑地图时更自由、更爽快，更像一名身手不凡的大侠，那我们就还是咬牙朝这个坑跳下去吧，花更多倍精力去解决。顺便透露一下~完成各地图中隐藏的跳跃任务也是玩家获得隐藏御灵\"小柒”的条件之一。\n\n\n\n\n\n技术探索\n如何用UE4做出适合仙剑的风格、如何呈现魔界、如何表现织物上的刺绣、整体色调如何迎合东方的审美……等等。在非光追显卡下如何运用光照烘培让场景更好看，以及在光追显卡下如何发挥光追的优势让光影更美。在这些方面我们做了很多尝试，早期也走了很多弯路，但也收获许多宝贵经验。\n\n\n\n\n\n目睹显卡荒，以及为了坚持让GTX 960显卡的玩家也能玩，我们为效能优化做了大量工作，也感谢各技术合作方的大力支持。我们也看到玩家对云游戏的需求，为手机端云游戏定制手机专用UI的版本，让PC显卡达不到最低配的玩家也能使在手机或智能电视上体验到画面精美且流畅的仙剑七。\n\n\n开放共创\n仙剑不是一个人的仙剑，是大家多年不弃的支持才能不断发展。我们始终相信广大玩家的力量，也欢迎大家共同创作。因为游戏是UE4制作，会使用UE4工具的同人大神们应不难制作仙剑7的MOD。我们对仙七的同人创作与之前的同人版权规范保持一致，未来并将推出资源编辑器，和仙剑共创UGC社区，届时欢迎大家捧场参与创作。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n姚仙\n点击下载\n541 个回答，查看全部。\n怎么评价 iOS 平台的仙剑奇侠传 5 ？\n如何看待古剑奇谭登陆steam？",

          "description": "1.北京故宫\n生就南人面孔，幸为帝都子民，幼时俯仰即视的前门箭楼、萦绕耳畔的广场旗乐至今依稀脑海，忘不了头顶的鸽哨嗡嗡，剪不断身后的虫吟声声，哦，还有每在冬日映入眼帘的蜂窝煤和冬储大白菜，可当它们寥寥无几时，绚烂的春光便徐徐而至了—我敝帚自珍的此般胡同情怀虽是难以名状，却始终镌刻在我心灵的最深处。\n\n其实，北京让我自豪的还有它文化之都的荣光！7项世界遗产冠绝寰球，颐和园、长城、十三陵、天坛、周口店遗址、大运河遗址名播海外，而其中最为杰出的代表便是作为明清两代皇宫、历经600载沧桑的北京故宫。我此番故地重游非是蹭川普访华的热点，而是光顾诸多亚欧名宫之后“蓄谋已久”的计划。作为占地7.6平方公里的北京皇城的核心宫城，灿若星辉的紫禁宫阙严整的布局、恢弘的气势足以令台北故宫的珍玩，京都御苑的素雅，昌德宫的别致，泰王宫的佛韵，卢浮宫、凡尔赛宫的奢靡，宁芬堡、天鹅堡的婀娜，圣彼得堡冬夏宫的壮观和克里姆林宫的庄严相形见绌，鳞次栉比的9999间宫殿（实测8700余间，不及乾隆年间最盛时的20000多间）、林林总总180万件先秦以来历代文物和洋洋洒洒万千言都难以描绘的宫廷传奇故事，都足以让它傲视天下，堪为中华乃至世界文明的瑰宝。\n\n毕竟是重游，我避开熙攘的三大殿、后三宫，五凤楼展览的千里江山图令我壮怀激烈；文华殿的陶瓷馆、武英殿的书画展让人印象深刻；东华门和东南角楼更是30年来首次踏入，还有如今辟为雕塑馆的寿康宫新近开放，平添了我不同以往的意趣。\n\n特别是京城最美时节的余温尚未散尽，一抹秋阳、一地金黄、一渊碧水和一袭红墙皆宛若画卷，不枉我一身轻装、一腔热血、一份执念和一世痴狂。\n2.北京云阳仙境\n每每在秋天醉人的季节，心里都蓦的想起郁达夫《故都的秋》中对于藏了京城最浓秋意之处的描写：“陶然亭的芦花，钓鱼台的柳影，西山的虫唱，玉泉的夜月，潭柘寺的钟声”，既然长于南国，不甘《沉沦》（郁达夫另一名作）的萌生先生（郁达夫的号）尚且如此钟爱北京的秋色，那么生于都门长于京华的我更应该早一天扑向那金黄的世界了！\n\n驱车北顾2小时，映入眼帘的是昔日边塞层峦叠嶂、枫林尽染的山林：从墨绿、青黄、金黄、橘黄到火红，似乎上帝也沉醉在这饱含诗意的季节里而无意中打翻了调色板，让我们有幸在碧空如洗的天际和柔美和煦的阳光下欣赏这幅壮美的画卷！\n\n听罢小溪潺潺，踏过缤纷落叶，轻享秋风送爽，忘归幽兰空谷。这一抹醉人山色，总教人难以忘记！\n\n3.北京居庸关长城\n恍然若梦二十载，金秋再叩居庸关。\n苍穹俯瞰九边地，万方游客万重山。\n峡谷漫道车如簇，晴空叠翠凭云帆。\n狼烟铁马今不现，但留雄浑在人间。\n\n始建于秦代、驰名于金代、复建于明代的居庸关长城因其险峻的地势、险要的位置而名满天下。而今遗世独立的关城不仅靠着“居庸叠翠”的壮美风光跻身“燕京八景”，而且它深厚的历史积淀和人类文化史上的典型意义早在上个世纪九十年代初便被联合国教科文组织关注，最终作为万里长城的精华被列入世界遗产名录。\n\n最为难能可贵的是，相对于八达岭长城摩肩接踵的地狱级游览模式，此地虽也游人络绎，却不至拥挤，堪为五洲四海倾慕长城人士的首选之所！\n\n4.慕田峪长城\n设施完备的慕田峪长城在疫情之前是个人潮汹涌的景区，与吸引国内游客的八达岭长城不同，这里的金发碧眼者居多，因此设施完备，缆车、索道、滑道一应俱全，在景区内还有汉堡王、subway等新快餐店，还有巨大的地下停车场，游览体验远超一般的5A级景区。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.山东枣庄台儿庄\n正如提起西安，便引人浮想联翩起周秦汉唐的钟鼎辉煌，台儿庄见证的是一个伟大民族不惧外侮坚贞无畏的抗争。国军将士积骨成山，积血成渊的那场大捷打破日无不胜的神话，在波澜壮阔的历史画卷中贡献了气壮山河浓墨重彩的一笔。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n奥古斯都\n点击下载\n73 个回答，查看全部。\n秋天适合去哪些地方旅游？\n秋天最适宜去哪里旅游？",

          "description": "中国人自己的国家公园，来了！\n2021年10月12日，在昆明召开的联合国《生物多样性公约》第十五次缔约方大会上，中国正式宣布设立三江源、大熊猫、东北虎豹、海南热带雨林、武夷山等第一批国家公园，保护面积达23万平方公里，涵盖近30%的陆域国家重点保护野生动植物种类。\n\n\n\n\n\n每一个国家公园，都是中国的符号、世界的珍宝。它们，是我国自然生态系统中最重要、自然景观最独特、自然遗产最精华、生物多样性最富集的部分。\n保护自然生态系统的原真性、完整性，是建立国家公园的根本目的。自东向西，从南到北，这些活生生的国家宝藏并不遥远，早已以各种形态进入我们的生活。\n\n\n三江源国家公园\n世界海拔最高，中国面积最大\n中国国家公园的第一代表，就是三江源国家公园。\n它是世界海拔最高，中国面积最大的国家公园，也是一座关乎14亿人乃至几十亿人生存与发展的“亚洲水塔”。\n\n\n\n三江源，可可西里。\n图/视觉中国\n多数中国人与三江源最直接的联系，刻在那些耳熟能详的诗词里。这来自“世界屋脊”的江河之水，正是李白笔下的天上水。一代代的探险者追寻“君住长江头”，从金沙江到当曲，终于找到了中华民族最珍贵的血脉宝地。\n\n\n\n三江源国家公园区位示意图。\n制图/孙璐，设计/may\n长江、黄河一路东去，孕育华夏民族；澜沧江经过三江并流的奇观，则成就东南亚第一巨川，为周边的五个国家注入生命之源。\n\n\n\n澜沧江大拐弯。\n图/视觉中国\n三江源的起源同样壮丽，这里有世界独一无二的地理奇观，始于一场地理大奇迹。\n亿万年间，印度板块与亚欧板块短兵相接，大地断裂抬升，塑造了如南北极一样遥远辽阔的“世界第三极”青藏高原。\n\n\n\n青藏高原，世界的屋脊。\n图/视觉中国\n每年夏天，一部分来自印度洋的暖湿气流会攀升到青藏高原，遇冷形成源源不断的降水，降水堆叠成雪山积雪，雪水被草甸吸纳入地下径流，再经由低处汇入约两个北京市大小的河湖和湿地，编织出大地…",

          "description": "国家公园制度是一种系统化思维，是按完整生态系统来保护重要生态功能区。以后会形成归属于中央政府的超级国家公园+归属于地方政府的小型自然保护区这样的自然保护地体系。\n这个事情从2015年就开始整体规划了。2015年，发改委牵头，会同13个部门发布《建立国家公园体制试点方案》；2017年，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅印发了《建立国家公园体制总体方案》；2019年，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅又印发了《关于建立以国家公园为主体的自然保护地体系的指导意见》。\n一、自然保护区的问题\n在国家公园之前，我们都听说过自然保护区。\n自然保护区是自下而上，由县、市、省、国家批准设立并分级管理，是有行政区划界线的。比如一片原始森林，根据行政区划，一半是A省的自然保护区，一半是B省的自然保护区，明明是一个完整的生态系统，但被割裂成两个。虽然两个都是国家级自然保护区，但两个省仍然各管各的，而且一个省内的自然保护区，都有多个部门在管。很多事情往往都是，多人负责等于没人负责，多头管理、交叉重叠、权责不清。即使各自做好了，也往往出现局部最优不是全局最优的情况，况且有些地方除了没有保护好，还可能过度开发资源。比如2018年秦岭违建上千栋别墅的事。\n自然保护区一般集体土地比例相对较高，一般通过协议等形式纳入保护管理，分级行使所有权。如果自然保护区里有矿，那有些地方卖起矿来一点都不含糊。\n二、国家公园解决的问题\n国家公园是从系统的角度，解决这种问题。\n对于十分重要而且跨区域的大尺度生态系统，原来可能被分成了多个自然保护区，现在整合为一个国家公园，突破行政区划界线，形成完整、原真的生态系统，进行整体保护、系统修复。比如大熊猫国家公园，跨四川、陕西、甘肃三省，总面积2.7万多平方公里。\n为了厘清责任，分清自然资源的所有权，国家公园是由国家公园管理局（国家林草局，归属于自然资源部）直接管理，钱是中央财政出，自然资源资产…",
