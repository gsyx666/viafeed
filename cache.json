Trying to use the defaultValue prop in react won't work either. if you add a value prop to the textarea the value of the text will be displayed but then it won't be editable, this is because the value prop is immutable.\nPassing a value prop to textarea like this <textarea value={'Hello World'}> </textarea>, will display the text Hello World on the textbox, but it won't be editable to make it editable we need to pass the a state to the value prop and update that state with the onChange prop like the code below.\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction TextBox () {\n\n    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello World');\n\n   return (\n           <textarea \n             value={text} \n             onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) }>\n          </textarea>\n         );\n\n}\n\nexport default TextBox;\n\n\nInside the TextBox component, I initialize the text state with 'Hello World' and passed it to the textarea as a value prop, this will be the initial text displayed in the text area. onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value) } this line of code updates the text state, with the new value.\nYou can learn more about handling form in react here",

A good example of this is a chat app, where you need to see what the other person is saying immediately. APIs can still work in this scenario, but it's not the best solution for the job.\nIn this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up a websocket server in Vue.JS, using a websocket server built in Node.JS and express.

Previously, if a user was to initiate an action that would trigger a component to update – such as a search that fetches a ton of new data to display – the whole page would just kind of hang while all that loading stuff was happening. This, as you can imagine, feels kind of awkward to users, so as developers we were forced to find other ways around it – skeleton UIs to make loads feel faster, debouncing, setTimeouts, etc. \nIn React, all updates are rendered equally urgently – o…",

          "description": "最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。\n但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。\n\n一、带宽进化的历史\n我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。\n56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。\n\n我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。\n后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。\n21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。\n\nADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。\n2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。\n\n从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。\n二、家庭的入户带宽\n现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。\n\n\n申请…",

          "description": "今天除夕，然而今年除夕不是“大年三十”，是“大年廿九”。\n理解这个事情，有几个层次。\n第一层：还有多少“大年廿九”？\n我考察了前后各一个世纪（1920s-2110s）的数据，发现两百年间，有118个“大年三十”、83个“大年廿九”。列表如下：\n“大”表示30天的大月，“小”表示29天的小月\n第二层：为什么会有三十/廿九（大小月）的差别？\n因为月相变化周期（朔望月）的平均长度是29.530588天，不是整数。农历为了确保每个“朔”（新月）都在初一，必须根据实际月相调整每个月的长度，使之取29天或30天。\n当然，你可能意识到了，“平均长度”意味着每个朔望月的长度是可以有变化的。实际上变化范围可以相当大：从不足29.3天到29.8天多，可以浮动半天还多。\n\n第三层：那么大小月是由朔望周期决定的吗？\n不难理解，不只由朔望周期决定。\n假设这个月的新月开始于某天0时，假设这个月的朔望周期是29.5天，那么下一个新月出现在第30天中午12点——也就是说第30天会被定义为下个月初一，本月就只能享有29天，成为小月。\n但如果这个月的新月开始于某天12时之后，下一个新月出现在第31天午夜0时之后，那么第31天才会被定义为下个月初一，本月可以成为拥有30天的“大月”。\n所以，大小月由两个参数决定：本月月初的新月出现在几点，以及本月的朔望周期。如下图所示。\n图中橙色、蓝色点的分界线，就是次月新月刚好卡在第30天、第31天之间的午夜0时的情况。\n\n第四层：为什么“大年三十”比“大年廿九”多？\n按照朔望周期平均29.53天考虑，大月、小月的数量之比应该是53:47～1.13。\n我统计了1921到2121这两个世纪，其中大月有1319个，小月有1167个，1319:1167=1.130，完全符合预期。\n但是，同期的大年三十和大年廿九的比例，却是118:83=1.42，比预期的1.13显著更大，这是为什么呢？\n我画出朔望周期在每年各个月份的分布：\n\n可以看出，年底年初的朔望周期，平均来说比年中的朔望周期要长4个小时——这是因为，地球在1月份到达近日点，绕日公转最快，此时月球需要追更长时间才能到达同样的相位，因此朔望周期较长。\n因此农历十二月，也就有更大的机会分到大月。\n\n总结：\n朔望月的平均长度是29.530588天，但是可以在约29.3到29.8之间浮动。\n农历大小月取决于当月和下月的新月出现在哪天。或者说，取决于当月月初的新月时刻和该月朔望周期。\n虽然大小月的总体比例接近53:47，但是腊月的大小月比例显著较高，可达1.42，因此大年多“三十”，较少“廿九”。\n你明白了吗？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n刘博洋\n点击下载",

          "description": "如果你看到了这篇文章，那么恭喜你，你将成为全中国最先了解“维C黄脸”真相的一批人。\n关于用了维C为什么脸黄，目前中文互联网上的解释都很牵强。于是我去查了一下文献，发现事实远比想象的复杂。除了脸变黄外，手掌，指甲缝还有手指缝都有可能变黄，这种变黄没法用清洁产品洗掉，只能等皮肤慢慢代谢掉。停用之后，基本上一两个星期，皮肤变黄就会消失，而且你会发现肤色比用之前更提亮了一个色号。\n目前中文互联网对于维C变黄的解释很牵强\n关于为什么维C上脸之后，有些人会变黄，目前中文互联网的主流说法是维C的氧化。因为一些维C精华放久了之后，会呈现出比较深的颜色。于是自然而然的认为维C上脸之后被氧化，也是染黄皮肤的元凶。但是这过程中，大家常常忽略一个点，那就是维C精华的颜色并没有深到可以染黄皮肤的地步。\n我手头正好有一瓶接近保质期的维C精华，大家可以看到颜色非常深。\n\n把精华滴一点到手上，颜色对比非常明显，然而涂开之后，对皮肤的颜色根本没有影响。\n\n这是因为维C氧化之后，颜色虽然会变深，但是真正有颜色的成分非常少。这些成分又都是水溶性的，根本没法染黄我们的皮肤。\n用了维C脸黄的元凶竟然是它\n为了搞清楚用了维C脸黄的原因，我查找了大量文献，终于找到了合理的解释。维C染黄角质层的元凶其实是维C代谢的产物之一：赤藓酮糖。\n看到赤藓酮糖这四个字，你的第一反应一定是：这是什么鬼？\n\n实际上，赤藓酮糖在国外可是个大大有名的成分，它是欧美常用的美黑剂。\n和亚洲人不同，欧美人喜欢颜色深的皮肤，这样的人被认为是有钱去海边度假，所以看起来给人感觉比较健康比较美。然而不是所有人都有钱有时间去海边度假，于是国外专门有一类美黑护肤品，而这个赤藓酮糖就是美黑剂的主要成分。它能和角化细胞中的角蛋白结合，形成类黑素，从而让皮肤颜色看起来更深。\n\n由赤藓酮糖来的类黑素并不是黑色的，而是红棕色，当用量较少的时候，看起来就是黄不拉几的颜色。实际上，赤藓酮糖的短期使用效果和维C染黄脸的效果一毛一样！\n\n从维C到赤藓酮糖，鬼知道我经历了什么\n维C的氧化是个非常复杂的过程[1]。简单来说，维C（抗坏血酸）先会变成脱氢抗坏血酸。随后脱氢抗坏血酸进一步变成2,3-二酮古洛糖酸。以此为基础，接下来是非常复杂的化学反应，生成的产物也非常多。而赤藓酮糖就是其中的产物之一。\n\n根据实验，一份维C如果氧化降解完全，可以生成至多0.28份赤藓酮糖，这个转化率相当高了。一般欧美使用赤藓酮糖作为美黑剂，这个成分的添加量是5%。所以如果维C精华含有15%的维C，如果全部氧化完全，相当于4.2%的赤藓酮糖，和欧美主流的美黑剂差不多了。\n好在现在主流的维C精华都使用各种方式来稳定维C，维C降解不多。上脸之后，如果做好防晒，停留在角质层中的维C被氧化的概率也不太大。产生的赤藓酮糖也就非常少了。\n脸黄了怎么办？\n很多人用维C明明是为了提亮肤色，结果脸变黄了，郁闷的同时还不免担心起来，染黄的脸洗都洗不掉！\n其实用了维C之后脸变黄大可不必焦虑，直接停用维C就是了。停止使用之后，也就缺少了赤藓酮糖的输入，皮肤中也就不会形成类黑素，皮肤就不会继续变黄。\n而根据赤藓酮糖的工作原理，它一般只作用于角质层最外层的一些角化细胞。而且我们的皮肤也会正常代谢。随着皮肤的代谢，这些染黄的角化细胞基本上一周就会代谢干净，最长不会超过两周。\n如果你又喜欢维C的功效，又不想皮肤变黄，那么还有个办法就是搭配使用一些果酸类的产品。日常使用维C的时候，手指手掌处的染黄会更明显，因为这些地方的角质层更厚，有更多的角蛋白和赤藓酮糖反应。使用一些温和的果酸类产品剥脱角质层，让角质层薄一些，脸黄就不那么明显了。当然，在使用果酸之前，得确保自己皮肤耐受，而且不是敏感肌。\n\n\n小结一下，用维C脸变黄并不是因为简单的氧化。而是因为维C转化成了赤藓酮糖，而这个成分能和角化细胞结合，形成类黑色素，从而染黄角质层。解决的问题很简单，要么停用维C，脸黄一两周就会消失；要么使用温和的果酸轻微剥脱角质层，减少黄气。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n胖博士\n点击下载\n29 个回答，查看全部。\n直接将vc捣碎用水溶解然后喷在脸上能美白吗？\nVC在护肤品中的形式如何和浓度多少？",

          "description": "这实际上是一个“功能安全”问题 —— 由于电子电气功能不正常工作而导致人身安全风险的问题。\n啥叫电子电气功能不工作呢？ \n比如说，不踩油门它自己加速、挂了前进档车却往后移动…… 这是比较严重的，很可能会出或大或小的事故。\n也有一些“看起来不太严重”的，比如仪表黑屏、中控黑屏。 当我还是一名功能安全工程时的时候，我一开始想：黑就黑了呗，车照样可以开，有什么大不了的呢？当年Benz发明汽车时，没有仪表不照样开吗？\n我的领导不这么想，在他的引导下，我们使用HAZOP、HARA等方法，分析了“黑屏”的各种可能性：\n\n高速上突然黑屏 → 引起驾驶员惊慌分神 → 部分水平较差的驾驶员，慌乱中误以为动力系统也失效了 → 紧急靠边停车的过程中发生碰撞 → 人身伤亡\n高速上突然黑屏 → 驾驶员忘了仪表上还有车速 → 驾驶员在长时间不知道确切车速的情况下继续驾驶 → 对车速判断失误造成追尾或其它碰撞 → 人身伤亡\n停车场突然黑屏 → 驾驶员立刻刹停观察现象 → 安全\n停车场未黑屏，但屏幕死机了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡\n停车场未黑屏，但屏幕卡顿了 → 驾驶员由D档挂入R档后中控依然显示D档 → 驾驶员误以为车子处于D档而放心地踩油门 → 车子倒车碰到后车或行人 → 人身伤亡\n\n第五种情况实际上发生过：\n车主曝特斯拉“挂D挡往后走”！后台数据公布：前后换挡多达14次\n总体来说，传统车企的功能安全工程师认为：仪表与中控都是安全相关的，(至少仪表)功能不能出错：无论任何情况下，既不能黑屏，也不能死机、卡住。\n但我想，这要求未免有点太高了。因为过高的可靠性，意味着成本…… 成本最终还是给消费者的。\n为此，我曾向多位传统车企的功能安全工程师提出一种不成熟的想法：\n\n 在卖车的时候，提醒消费者“咱们这车啊，在高速上是有可能黑屏死机的；莫慌，继续开即可”。当驾驶员有黑屏的心理预期之后，第一次遇到黑屏也不会慌，从而避免了事故。\n\n关于这一点，我有实际体验：\n第一次遇到黑屏时，好慌，大概花了5秒钟我才确认“车子还可以开”、“只是个小事情，镇定”、“导航信息没了，还是赶紧找机会停车重启吧“！\n第二次遇到黑屏时，一点也不慌了 —— 因为心里有预期它会黑屏，所以造边停车重启，常规操作了。\n\n 仪表与中控可以失效，但是要求：一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。如此一来，就避免了仪表与中控显示错误的误导而造成的事故。\n\n不出意料，传统车企听了我的想法后都直摇头：你这么做，与特斯拉有什么区别？ 出了事故，特斯拉扛得住舆论，咱们可扛不住啊！\n想想也对，这不单单的工程技术的事情，也要考虑车企的公关思路不同。综合考虑后，每个车企只能选择最适合自己的技术方案。\n尽管如此，我还是向特斯拉提一个建议，可以让车主更安全： 仪表与中控可以失效，但是一旦失效必须黑屏，不能死机卡屏，也不能卡顿。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n张抗抗\n点击下载\n43 个回答，查看全部。\n电动汽车高速上死机了，咋办？在线等挺急的！？\n亲 特斯拉粉丝宣传死机不影响开车是不是因为特斯拉会经常黑屏啊？",

          "description": "前言\n最近用 Adobe Illustrator 绘制了一大堆图标，操作基本都保持右手握鼠标、左手小拇指以 Ctrl 为圆心在键盘上活动的状态。在绘制过程中左手常常需要按下大量的快捷键，为了提高效率，我把快捷键设定在了键盘最上面一排的功能键上。而实际用起来，从 F5 键向右，操作逐渐又不方便起来了。\n我开始想象：如果有一个小的键盘可以放在左手旁边、每个按键都能映射为不同的快捷键就好了。这个理想中的键盘需要满足这几点：\n\n可自定义按键功能，实现快捷操作；\n体积小，按键尽可能多；\n造型简洁，最好是无线；\n可以根据当前软件自动切换按键功能（加分项）\n\n根据以上要求，很快我就搜到了这次的主角：微软蓝牙数字键盘。\n功能简介\n技术规格\n微软蓝牙数字键盘的键位与普通键盘的数字区基本一致。通过蓝牙与电脑配对成功后，左上角的按键可以快速打开计算器进行计算。另外，它可以同时与3台设备配对，通过背面的按钮进行切换。\n安装键盘配套应用的「微软鼠标和键盘中心」后，18个按键中，有17个都可以自行设置功能（计算器键只能打开计算器或充当 NumLock 键）。通过 basic settings 可以设置全局按键功能，在 app-specific settings 中可以为不同应用单独设置按键功能，从而实现切换应用时自动切换案件配置方案。\n应用中可选择的众多预设功能列表\n在「微软鼠标和键盘中心」中提供了众多预设功能，利用列表的最后隐蔽着的 Key Combination 和 Macro 设置自定义快捷键、录制宏，则是让这个键盘成为真正的效率神器的关键。\n使用体验\n以 Adobe Illustrator 为例，它的快捷键组合非常多，其中不乏要按下 Alt Shift Ctrl 的同时按下一个字母键的，难以单手操作；想要为常用的一些操作设置快捷键时，不仅要考虑能否轻松地单手按下，又要避免与现有的快捷键重复。使用微软蓝牙数字键盘设置快捷键可以不用考虑能否单手操作的问题，即便远在键盘两端的 Shift + Ctrl + 9 也可以通过指定的一个按键完成操作。\n我将使用频率较高的快捷键映射到这个键盘，又为一些原本没有快捷键的高频操作设置了新的快捷键。如下图将快捷键设置好之后，绘制图形的效率显著提高。例如原本需要 Ctrl + C、Shift + Ctrl + V 两步操作的「就地粘贴」操作，现在只需要按下「.」键即可完成。\n我设置的按键功能与对应快捷键\n上图中大部分是通过 Key Combination 设置直接输入对应快捷键，「就地复制」的功能是通过 Macro 设置实现。值得一提的是，你还可以在 Macro 设置中输入鼠标按键和鼠标位移。\nKey Combination 的设置界面Macro 的设置界面\n总结\n微软蓝牙数字键盘外观小巧简洁；功能上不仅能满足日常办公、媒体控制这些基本操作，也可以在图片处理、视频剪辑等场景下提高效率，甚至用来玩游戏、演示幻灯片……只要根据你的使用场景进行设置，这样一个特别的小键盘也一定可以成为你的效率神器。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n扫码分享",

On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty\nstraightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the\ninternet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for\neveryone!)\nBut when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One\nquestion is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing\nthem THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?\nI asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6\nand I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here.

Now offering book as an ePUB.\nUxn, re-wrote entire documentation, and started a project devlog.\nNasu, improved zoom tool, it is now possible to move between tiles(Masto) while zoomed.\nYufo, released a small game for the Virtual Pet Jam.\n100r, added new page: cast-iron cookware, and updated medical.\nNews\nOn January 28th Uxn turned 1 year old! We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed code, ideas, time and laughs to help this project grow into what it is now. It was a wonderful year for smol ordinators. See an image that Rekka made for uxn's birthday.\nWe finally released versions of the Uxn emulator for all major systems(Linux, OS X and Windows), with the option of a version bundled with a few starter roms. We simplified the guide too, to make it easier to install and use.\nOur lion's mane mushroom grew another full head, we harvested it and made some mushroom pakoras.\nIn other news, Devine was interviewed on Anonradio, listen to it here. Also, Compudanzas released an Introduction to Uxn Programming book, with a foreword by Devine.\nPino book club\nWe're reading The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino, and The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity by David Graeber.\nContinue Reading",
