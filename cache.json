I made an issue for it already, but I need to start working on it. And, that's where my question lies. \nI can either build the system to detect the duplications based on plain text. This is how most systems work because it is the simpler of the two options. But, it is also the most failure prone. For instance, this system would fail if there was the same exact code in two places, but there was a comment in the middle of one of them- it would not register as a duplicate.  \nAlternatively, I can use an abstract syntax tree to detect the duplications. But, theres another problem there- what is the most-lightweight and all-around-best javascript parser out there? I'm planning on using the babel parser but I'm already running into a problem because it doesn't parse the comments in a way I would like. \nSo, if you have an opinion on what I should do, please leave a comment below. Also, please star the project and contribute if you have time. If you can, that would be amazing, and I thank you so much!",

It triggers a notification to the runner I specified, and then it processes the series of tasks I specified.\nWhich involves building and deploying.\nThis is a legacy React project, and had long been updated. After upgrading the packages I git committed. Build built successfully but deployment failed. With the following error:\n\nI read through the error to understand what the problem really was, and I found it:\nModule.createRequire is not a function\n\nThat was the only error that was reasonably clear indeed and meant something.\nSo I Googled it, and I found out that it's an issue with Create React App, it's always on or looking for the latest, which means the Node engine version has to always be the latest and that includes my npm version, else some things might break.\nSo in essence whatever machine running that project has to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6\nMy GitLab-ci.yml contains a Docker image with a node version of 10.15.3, so there is a need to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nimage: giona69/node-10.15.3-aws-eb\n\nAnd I temporarily replaced the docker image with the latest node.\n\n\n\n\nimage: node:14.18.2\n\nRebuilt Node-Sass\nI added \nnpm rebuild node-sass \nAnd Voila!!

If you are unaware, I would highly suggest you to start from the part_1 ( of the 6 series post).\nSo the first question that can strike you is why we need a custom directive when Angular already provided us with 6 amazing directives. The simple reason is there can be multiple scenarios where the exact requirements are not met using the built-in directives. In those cases we need to write our own logic to meet the requirement and custom directives comes to the rescue.\nNow, lets see how we can create our own custom directive.\nng generate directive <directive-name>\nng g d <directive-name>\nLets create a simple directive which when applied to an el…",

I am one of the latter and is definitely not quite ready yet.\nI am curious on what did you do during the long holiday - either personal and professional wise. Below is my story. \nSpent my leave on staycation. I hang out with the family and in-laws. Lots of shopping and ice skating.\n\n\nAte a bunch of unhealthy food I shouldn't be eating - more than what I imagined. Major diet after New Year to follow. 😊\n\n\nFinally, wrote couple of ReactJS articles here at dev.to and created a video version that I am very proud of (still honing my video recording skills). Below are the links if you want to check it out. \n\n\n\nThanks for the dev.to community for a great, warm support of the articles.\nAdvance React Interview Questions\nBasic React Interview Questions\nSo, that is my story.

Eventually, however, slacking off on testing comes back to bite you; for me, luckily, it did when things were only getting started, but the point was clear - writing good tests is a top priority.\nFor Agrippa, however, writing good tests is far from trivial - it's a CLI for generating React components based on a project's environment (dependencies, existence of config files, etc.), as well as an optional .agripparc.json config.

So we as human beings fear the unknown, but a good interview should be more like a conversation instead of a police interrogation.\nInterviewers have asked me if I know S.O.L.I.D. principles, unit testing in deep and even I've been asked to use graph theory to solve a problem. When I got the job, there is a high dependency on a specific dll that do a lot of different things (This by it's own violates all SOLID principles), I never used anything they asked me, so what's the need to make the technical interview unnecessarily complex and tedious?. When I am interviewing a candidate I try to make a conversation like: Tell me about your experience, the latest project you are working on, what technology you like the most, and why. I guess that they are trying to emulate top-tech companies like GAFAM, what I have heard about these companies is that the technical interviews are very focused on data structures and problem-solving (not sure if they are used in daily work).\nMy point is: if your company focuses on a specific product, ask what you're looking for, ask for the technologies you are currently using, please stop doing stupidly complex technical tests unless your company is currently using these techniques to solve complex problems.\nAnd as always, happy coding!.",

MicroPython is an incredible tool for rapidly prototyping and iterating on hardware projects. It's similar to Arduino but instead of using C++, which you have to re-compile each time you make a code change, it runs on the Python interpreter which allows you to run code changes immediately. The quick feedback cycle enabled by MicroPython will, I believe, power the future of embedded development.\nWhat is the \"hello world\" of embedded software? Why, blinking an LED, of course!

This project also focuses heavily on flexbox, so if you want to get some practice with that then this is the perfect tutorial!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUBhdvK31A \nIn this first part, I'm showing you how to set up the html, and the styling for the mobile version of the website. In the second part I am going to show you how to make the page fully responsive and look good on desktop.\nI have made a git repository that you can clone to follow along the tutorial (which I recommend)\n\nhttps://github.com/SebCodesTheWeb/disneyclone\nHello! My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.\nI'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch). I started this project to get some practice with css flexbox.\nBy the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself and making tutorials on my \nYouTube-channel .\nIt would be awesome if you would follow along me on my journey and learn with me. You can follow my  blog  and subscribe to my  YouTube channel. And if you liked the YouTube video then it would really make my day if you left a comment or liked this post.\n\nKeep Coding.",

The purpose of the OSI model is to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software. OSI has a stack of seven layers within the model and the layers are used to help user identify what is happening within a networking system.\nWhat is OSI layer?\n\n\nThe OSI layer are typically described from the top layer down. With the help of layering we decompose the problem of building a network into manageable components (layers), these layers help with modular design and easy troubleshooting.

Some people think that @if would be a better name than @when, the reason behind this naming is probably that Sass already uses @if, and it would be annoying to many developers if they had to refactor their Sass logic.\nThe bad news is that it's not supported by any browser at this moment, it's not even listed on caniuse.com.\nWhat do you think about this new proposal?",

And it's not just their fancy features like 3D graphics, interactivity, and so on. Even very basic commands like like changing color are going to be different in each Logo.\nI'll be using in-browser papert Logo, so all examples will work in papers.

          "description": "Sometime in JavaScript we need a function that executes only once and never again. Basically a function that disappears right after its called once. How can we achieve this? for example we could do this:\nconst func1 = function(){\n             console.log('this function will never run again!`)\n                }\n func1();\n\nBut we definitely can call this func1() again if we want. This is NOT what we want to do. We want to execute a function immediately without having to save it somewhere.\nfunction(){\nconsole.log('This function will never run again')\n}\n\nif we run this, we would get an error function statements require a function name an that's because JavaScript expects a function statement, but we simply start a new line of code with the function keyword.\nHere we can still trick JavaScript into thinking that this is just an expression. We do that by simply wrapping all of this into GROUPING OPERATOR().\n(function(){\n   console.log('This is will never run again!')\n});\n\nso we basically transform the previous statement into an expression. But the function didn't execute yet. To execute the function we need to call it like this (adding '()' next to it, like we do with regular function call).\n(function(){\n   console.log('This is will never run again!')\n})();\n\nSo we create a function expression and we immediately call it. which is why this pattern is called Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE).\nThe same would also work for an arrow function this way.\n(() => console.log('This function will never run again!'))();\n\nThis will also never run again.\nso this is not really a feature, of the JavaScript.\nit's more of a pattern, that some developers come up with and it is widely used.\nThis design pattern is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.\nSelf-Executing -> it executes the moment it is created.\nAnonymous -> it has no name and is not stored variable.",

What is fascinating is that planning and creating a design template is better as it allows you to check which font and colors suit your website and style, because it's not easy to change theme of whole website once it's somewhat or maybe completely built as compare to UI creation tools.\n\nUsing such tools like FIGMA and Adobe XD allows us to quickly do those changes and finalize the design, all then is left to implement them in real-time website.\n*1. Icons *\nhttps://www.flaticon.com/ that I personally use when it comes to icons and small vectors to aid website looks.\n\n2. Theme and colors\nhttps://flatuicolors.com/ as it provides best colors and combos that are so perfect when actually implemented. It's easy and free to use :)\n\n3. Images\nhttps://unsplash.com/ although you might already know about it. But something that you might not be knowing is that they also provide users with an API that provide aesthetic images by artists for you to implement in your source code.\n\n4. Fonts. YES! please\nhttps://fonts.google.com/ or https://fontawesome.com/ (font awesome provides icons as well).\n\nHope all this was useful to you and I hope you'll apply these in your projects so they would look even more attractive.\nTry finding the best resources that suits and makes you paragraphs sexier!",

It is an optimization technique which is used quite extensively in the programming world.\nAn important point to remember is that whenever memoization is used, there must be a criteria which would dicate when the cached results are no longer valid and the computation must be done again.\nTo understand the problem this solves, consider the following React component:\nimport { useState, Fragment } from \"react\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  cons…",

          "description": "The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.\nlet us look at an example\n\nlet person = {};\n\nperson.name = \"David\";\nperson.age = 45;\n\nperson.eat = function() {\nconsole.log(`person is eating`);\n}\n\nHere we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.\n\nWhen you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.\nSo the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.\nWhen a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:\nReturns undefined (if you tried to access a property).\nThrows an error (if you tried to call a method).",

Its far-reaching applications include autonomous vehicles, smart home technology, Speech-to-Text APIs and software, fraud detection, streaming service recommendations, image recognition, and much more.\nAs more advances are made in Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, expect these applications to become even more far reaching and ingrained into our everyday lives.\nThis post looks at some of the top Machine Learning conferences planned for 2022. 2021 saw the return of some in-person conferences, though most remained hybrid in-person/virtual events at the very least. Expect this trend to continue in 2022 as well.\nThis list of conferences includes the highly technical, li…",

          "description": "Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. \nOur mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future.

In this blog post, we will talk about the best programming languages for data science and why they are so important!\nR Language\nPython\nC++\nJava\nWolfram Language\nR, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.\nData science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code.

In some cases, the function name and parameters may be self-explanatory but how the parameters and function work may be unknown unless the code is read which can contain large number of complexities.Therefore having documentation on inputs and outputs of a fu…",

This weekend, I had some freetime from school & got to work!\nThis library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js & Remix)\nWant a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak & experiment around with values!\nTo download the library, head over to your terminal:\nyarn add custom-pointer-react\n\nNext, import the cursor component into your file & customise it! Don't forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.\nimport { Cursor } from 'custom-pointer-react'\n...\nconst Cursor = () => {\n  return (\n    ...\n    <Cursor {...passParametersToCustomise} />\n    ...\n  )\n}\n...\nexport default App\n\nAll parameters are optional, & here's a list of the different parameters which you can customise: \n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\ncolor\nThe background colour of the cursor\n#000000\n\n\nshowRing\nControls whether to show the ring around the cursor\ntrue\n\n\nringSize\nControls the size of the ring around the cursor\n50px\n\n\ncursorSize\nControls the size of the cursor\n10px\n\n\nringBorder\nControls the width of the ring's border\n2px\n\n\n\nNeed help finding the right parameters? Check out the demo website!\nNow, go into your app & import the MouseContext provider.\nimport { MouseContextProvider } from 'custom-pointer-react'\n...\nReactDOM.render(\n  <MouseContextProvider>\n    <App />\n  </MouseContextProvider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n...\n\nYour custom cursor should be good to go!",

Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.\nHorizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples.

In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!\nFor the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I've decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college's C language course notes. The issue I'm working on is about \"Standardize frontmatter across all pages\". When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.\nI've done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:\nAdded id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages\nEach property of frontmatter was unified in order\nUnified format of description\nShortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the <meta name=\"description\" content=\"...\"/> inside the <head>tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)\nAdded \"Standardize frontmatter\" to the CONTRIBUTING.md file\nPR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Getting reviews and change requests\n\n\nOne of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo's owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I'm familiar with the course notes, but I wasn't very good at C language.\nThe goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn't change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.",

You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. \nWhen you clone a Go project from github, for example, you'll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you're coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. \nYou may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn't have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project's go.mod file. \nFor example:\ngithub.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn't have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc.

I won't lie, I was quite nervous... But she was super nice and the interview went really well.\nHere are the top 3 things I learned from Cassidy:\n1- Be humble and genuine\n2- Some companies want access to your social media\nshe keeps all the control over her social media. With more than 170K followers I guess that many companies could use it for personal marketing...\n3- Don't be afraid to experiment\nthat rule is BS! Cassity was never afraid to leave a job where she was not happy and that gave her the opportunity to experiment with different types of companies and find which ones she prefers to work at.\nThese are just 3 of a lot of lessons I took from my casual chat with Cassidy Williams. Would love to hear your thoughts on the interview. What questions did I miss? You can listen to the full chat here",

You may be asking why I don't just simply use ERC721's tranferFrom function.

          "description": "Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.\nA couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. \nThe specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh\n posted this:\nDev.to as a headless CMS\nVisakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read\n#react\n        #javascript\n        #webdev\n        #opensource\n      \nThis was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.\nYou've probably noticed several deprecations lately. It's all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.",

Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.\n\n\nIt facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. \n\n\nEasily switches between Versions of your code.\n\n\nEasily undo changes.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What is GitHub?🤔\n\n\nFirst, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.\nIt provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.\nGit is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.\nGit is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.\nGit is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.\nCan't be any simpler than that!!\nPlease make sure you leave a like 👍/loveheart ❤️ on this one.

Errors are unavoidable when writing code, which can be frustrating at times. \nvia GIPHY\nIn this article, I'll show you how to handle exceptions in Python.\nAn exception is an error that occurs while the program is running. In some cases, an exception may cause the program to stop or produce unexpected results. For example, taking a look at Fig 1.0.

However, when the program is run, an exception occurs as shown in Fig 1.1.\n\nFig 1.0\n\n\n\nFig 1.1\n\n\nThe error message displayed in Fig 1.1 is called a traceback.

In this post, I present a recap of all the API launches and programs - from Twitter as well as the academic research community - that has made it easier for researchers to do research with Twitter data.\nLaunched in January 2021, the academic research product track is one of the biggest updates to the Twitter API v2 for the academic research community. It provides qualified academic researchers free access to the full-archive of public Tweets (previously, academics had to use the paid premium API to get Tweets older than 7 days).

          "description": "3 年前，Apple 发布了 Apple Watch Series 4，升级了更大显示屏的同时，也带来了心电图功能。然而，国行版本的手表却与它无缘 —— 倒不是说硬件不支持，而是在软件上需要适配及审核。\n直到今天，Apple 在最新的 iOS 15.2 和 watchOS 8.3 系统中，终于将过审已久的心电图功能带到国行 Apple Watch 上。除了心电图之外，iOS 15.2 其实还有不少值得关注的功能，一起来看看吧。\n国行 Apple Watch 支持心电图\n盼望着，盼望着，心电图终于来了。只要你的手表是 Apple Watch S4 及之后的款式，在升级了 watchOS 8.3 和 iOS 15.2 之后，就可以在 iOS 设备的「健康 > 浏览 > 心脏」中打开它。稍等一会，Apple Watch 上便会出现心电图 App。\n如果你先前已经通过各种方式开通了心电图功能，更新后不会受到影响。\n\n要使用心电图也很简单，只需佩戴好手表后打开心电图 App，将另一只手的食指放在数码表冠上，30 秒之后就能完成检测，同时检测结果也会即时同步到 iOS 设备的健康 App 中。你可以在健康 App 中将心电图导出为 PDF 文件提供给医生作为参考。\n不过需要重点注意：Apple Watch 并非专业医疗设备，心电图检测的结果只能参考，不能用于诊断心脏病等疾病。如果对检测的结果有疑问或有身体不适，还是尽快咨询医生为好。\n\n另外值得一提的是，此次国行 Apple Watch 的心电图功能，全称为「移动心电图房颤提示软件」，且软件版本为 V1，支持检测正常心率下的房颤。而目前最新的软件版本为 V2，除了支持 V1 版本的功能外，还能够检测高心率下的房颤。\n\nApp 隐私报告可视化\n在以往的 iOS 15 系统中，App 隐私报告这一功能就已经存在了。只不过彼时我们只能选择导出…",

          "description": "近期，Mental Canvas 这款特殊的 iPad 绘画 App 凭借其独特的画作展示效果闯入了公众视野。\n\n简单来说，这是一款拥有「3D 画布」的草图绘画工具，你可以将图层分别放置于立体空间中的不同位置，最后得以通过运动的「摄像机」来展示整个画作。\n\nMental Canvas 目前提供的功能数量不算多，本文将逐一详细介绍，作为简单的使用教程提供给各位参考。  \n界面排布\nMental Canvas 除了画布界面外没有设置其他界面，在打开 App 时会立刻创建一个新项目。操作界面中的按钮排布和交互设计的逻辑与大多同类产品存在较大出入，说实话这让我在刚上手时有一点懵。\n界面中设有「顶部工具栏」、左侧的「画布及图层列表」、底部的用于定位摄像机的「时间轴」，共三个板块。顶部工具栏从左至右可以分为「操作区」「绘制区」「定位区」和「模式切换开关」四个区域。（当然，这些都是我自拟的名字。）\n\n绘制区\n在顶部工具栏中的绘制区可以点选使用「画笔工具」「橡皮擦工具」「油漆桶工具」来进行作画。选中画笔工具后再次点击该按钮可以展开画笔设置界面，提供了更改画笔类型和调节画笔粗细的选项。\n\n这三个按钮右侧有「调色盘」按钮，展开后可以进行取色或自定义颜色。\n\n选取调整界面\n位于绘制区最左侧的是「选取调整」按钮，选中后会在顶部工具栏置换为一系列新按钮，实质上是进入了选取调整界面。顶部工具栏左侧的区域为「选取区」，右侧为「调整区」。\n\n选取区\n选取区的按钮用于选取图层内的部分内容以便调整，其中提供了「按笔画选取」和「套索选取」两种选取方式，分别可以选择画面中一部分笔画或选择圈选的部分区域作为选区。其余的按钮分别为「向选区添加」「从选区减去」「取消选取」「反选」。\n调整区\n调整区包含几种对选区的调整操作，从左至右分别是用于修改选区部分颜色的「重上色」、清除选区内容的「删除」、启用后会使后几个调整改为对…",

          "description": "写了两篇关于消费的文章，这次回归产品经理主业，聊聊个人管理。\n做好个人管理和做好产品经理这两件事在我看来是相辅相成的。首先，我们身边的大部分人都是毕业就开始打工（甚至还没毕业已经在打工了），大部分的时间都花在了工作上，一方面是为了生存，通过劳动我们会获得报酬，另一方面也可以说是实现自我价值或者其他你觉得重要的点。总之我们的生活方式以及整个人都在不知不觉间被工作塑造了。\n以我自己为例，产品经理这个岗位的其中一项职能是项目管理，虽然有的公司会细分出「项目经理」岗，但大部分中小型公司的产品都在兼任或曾经兼任过项目经理。所以在产品经理工作中，我逐渐养成了项目管理的思维模式：使项目能够在有限资源限定条件下，实现或超过设定的需求和期望的过程，而个人管理是我们每个人最独一无二的项目。\n\n百度百科：在个人管理中，个体既是管理者，也是被管理者。\n\n背景\n一开始我的个人管理诉求源于我对现实生活的不满，毕业后我留在家乡工作，住在家里。因为无法随时所欲地生活，就十分想拥有自己的住所，然后我制定了一个 3 年买房计划。可当时的我不知道个人管理怎么做，更没有认清现实，只是内心有一个很想实现的目标，其他全凭感觉，每天的日子还是过得浑浑噩噩，不仅没有缩短跟目标之间的距离，还在走弯路。\n工作中的管理实践\n所幸我的工作是自己喜欢的，因为能接触到更多的信息，并不断学习新东西。我需要每天在工作前明确当前是项目的什么阶段，写下今天要完成什么任务，要跟谁沟通以及得到怎样的结果，然后在每天结束工作后记录当天任务的完成情况并复盘：是否存在风险？该如何安排明天的工作？——当然你也可以把这些简称为「日报」。除此以外，我还要去了解行业发展趋势和热点，国内外优秀互联网公司最近又推出了什么新 App、新功能等等，就需要有工具去整理并归纳这些资料以及尽量高效。\n通过工作，我首先接触并掌握的个人管理内容是信息管理也可称为知识管理。\n这…",

          "description": "互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。\n下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。\n\n一、历史回顾\nWeb 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。\n\nWeb 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。\n\n二、Web3 的特征\nWeb3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。\n\n我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。\nWeb 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。\n娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。\n在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。\n三、虚拟世界\n所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。\n到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。\n四、Web3 是分布式的\n这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！\n这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：\n（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；\n（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。\n五、区块链的作用\n如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。\n这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。\n一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。\n另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。\n六、数字资产\n区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。\n如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。\n\n举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。\n我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。\n我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。\n创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说：\"Web3 就是所有权\"，就是这个意思。\n\n如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。\n目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。\n（完）\n文档信息\n版权声明：自由转载-非商用-非衍生-保持署名（创意共享3.0许可证）\n发表日期： 2021年12月 7日",

          "description": "各位许久不见，我是片冈智！\n有关《水仙》的（实拍）电影化，这里也稍稍写下我个人的感想。\n\n\n事实上至今为止，无论是日本还是美国的制片商，都曾有过电影化的提案。\n而最终拒绝的理由，虽然有好几个……但其中最重要的，则是故事最后“让濑津美的病治好了”的结局设计吧。\n有关最后（濑津美）走向大海的情节，如果是将其做暧昧处理的话倒还可行，然而“治好病了真好呢！”这种“廉价的结局”却是难以容许的。\n我想做出这种结局设计的理由可能有“更讨喜观众”或者其他商业上的考虑……但对于那些只会想着“人死了就是悲剧！就是坏结局（Bad End）！”的人，恐怕《水仙》原本就不会是他们能理解的作品吧。\n\n\n有关这点，本次负责电影化的导演则是纯粹地喜欢着《水仙》，对于何为《水仙》的“核心”也很能理解，我也十分放心。\n哪怕有设定上的变更，只要“核心”不变的话就没问题。\n\n\n反之，仅仅只有设定或者表面上的故事情节依循原作，结局却魔改成“病治好了！幸福结局！”的话可太糟糕了＞＜\n如果不那么做就没法受观众欢迎、商业角度很难成功的话，那还不如别电影化了。\n\n\n如果不那么做就很难找到赞助商的话，那还不如用更低的预算、花上更多的时间去“自由”地创作要来得更好。\n而我自己也会竭尽全力协助的。\n\n\n我想作为（权利）签约方的sekai project，也是能同意这种做法的。\n毕竟对于过去我很少同意Nekoneko Soft作品动画化的理由，他们也是知情的。\n\n\n简而言之，对于《水仙》电影化这件事，某种程度上还请大家放心！\n作为原作者来说我信任着本次企划的导演，而事先做剧本监修的时候，要是有实在不行的内容我也会提出意见。\n\n\n再说一个很现实的情况，这次电影化我自己是拿不到一分钱的w\n但之所以仍然要做，既是作为原作者的自尊、也是为了尽到对喜欢本作的朋友们的义务。\n\n\n\n\n\nお久しぶり、片岡ともです！\nナルキ映画化について、少し長いけど書いてみますね！\n実は今までにも、日本とアメリカからも映画化のオファーがありました。\n断った理由は幾つかありますが……\nラストシーンで「セツミの病気が治る」エンディングを希望されたのが大きいです。\nラストで海に入るシーンを、曖昧にするくらいならＯＫですが、\n病気が治って良かった！な「安易なエンディング」は許容できません。\n恐らく「観客ウケ」や商業的なことも考えた上でのことかも知れませんが……\nそもそも人が死ぬ＝悲劇だ！　バッドエンドだ！としか思えない方に、\n理解できるような作品なのでしょうか？　ナルキは？\n\nそれに対して今回の監督さんは、純粋にナルキ好きの方だと思っています。\n何がナルキの「芯」であるか？を理解している方なら、自分は安心しています。\n幾つかの変更点があったとしても「芯」がブレなければ。\n逆に、設定・表層の出来事だけ原作通りだったとしても、\nラストで病気が治った！ハッピーエンド！とかダメすぎ＞＜\nそうしないと観客ウケ・商業的に厳しいなら、映画化しない方が良い。\nそうしないとスポンサーが付かないのなら、低予算で何年かかっても「自由」に作って貰える方がうれしいです。\n自分も出来る限り協力しますし。\nたぶん契約元のsekai projectさんも、それでＯＫと言うはずです。\n自分がねこねこ作品のアニメ化も、滅多に許可しないことを、よくご存じですし。\n\nそんなわけでナルキ映画化については、ある程度ご安心下さいませ！\n自分としては監督を信頼していますし、\n事前の脚本チェックでダメすぎる場合は、自分も意見すると思います。\nあと、ぶっちゃけですが、映画化しても自分には１円もお金は入って来ませんよw\nでもこれは作者としてのプライドと、作品を気に入ってくれた方への義務だと考えています。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n片冈智\n点击下载\n65 个回答，查看全部。\n如何看待弹丸论破新作Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony中国区的超高定价？\n这配置吃鸡开什么特效最合适 升级硬件升级什么？换E3 1230 v2如何？",

He has him cornered at gunpoint. All he has to do is pull the trigger. But he always talks first. He explains the hero's mistakes to him. Jeers. Laughs. And gives the hero time to think his way out of the situation, or be rescued by his buddy. Cf. most James Bond movies.[1]\n反派死于话多之误。反派一直梦想杀掉主角。他已经用枪把主角逼到了墙角，只需轻轻一扣扳机就大功告成了；但他开始详细地阐述主角所犯的错误，然后嘲讽一番、冷笑几声。而所有这些嘴炮存在的意义就是为了让主角有充足的时间思考该如何逃生，或者成功地被同伴解救。007系列电影中的詹姆斯·邦德先生就是这种现象的受益者。\n这本书里还收录了很多奇奇怪的词条，比如：\n推理题材第一法则 First Rule of Whodunits. 在许多凶…",

          "description": "本文由西甲官方提供合作支持，首发 @体育产业生态圈 \n\n\n前些天，一位西甲联盟的工作人员突然给我发了条消息：“有没有兴趣写篇文章，聊聊我们上赛季是如何帮助格拉纳达击败巴萨的？”\n我当即愣在了原地，用不停颤抖的手指做出了回复：“这个……真的是能放到台面上讲的事情吗？”\n等到对方发来一大堆资料和视频的时候，我才焕然大悟。原来故事是这样的：格拉纳达教练团队的分析师阿尔瓦罗-加西亚近期谈到了球队回到西甲后这两个赛季的成功里，数据分析起到了至关重要的作用。更神奇的是，他们的数据分析系统并不是俱乐部自己搭建的，而是西甲联盟对所有西甲和西乙球队免费开放的平台Mediacoach。\n作为例子，他重点提到的就是今年四月格拉纳达客场2-1击败巴萨的那场比赛。\n\n\n【那场比赛里发生了什么？】\n已经过去了8个月的时间，可能不少球迷已经不太有印象了，所以咱们先简单回顾一下剧情：巴萨当时与皇马、马竞之间的西甲冠军竞争日趋白热化，那场比赛他们也牢牢掌握了控球权。上半场各种围攻并且由梅西打进一球，但下半场被马奇斯和莫里纳连入两球逆转。\n那是格拉纳达队史首次在诺坎普击败巴萨，之前他们在这里的成绩惨到25场全败，连一分都没有拿到过。也是因为这场爆冷输球，巴萨错过了登顶积分榜首的绝佳机会，后来丢掉心气率先退出了冠军争夺。\n\n那么问题来了，这场比赛和那个叫Mediacoach的数据平台有什么关系呢？\n再来简单科普一下这个平台，这是由西甲联盟开发的数据分析可视化系统，通过架设在西甲和西乙42队主场的高速摄像头来采取每场比赛里的专业数据，最终形成一个庞大的数据库系统和大量自动生成的报告。\n重点来了：这个平台对每一家俱乐部都完全开放，免费、没有VIP和白金会员，甚至还不停呼吁你们赶紧来白嫖。\n\n有的俱乐部坚信天下没有白吃的午餐，本身也不怎么把数据分析当回事，但也有人产生了浓厚的兴趣，比如格拉纳达。系统上线时，这家来自安…",

          "description": "肉的质地一直是个神奇的命题。\n有的人烧出来的肉软硬适中，有的人照着同样的菜谱却死活做不出来。烧菜的火力、时间，甚至油、淀粉的使用都对肉的质地产生重要的影响。\n肉是嫩还是老，核心点是温度，因为它决定了熟肉的2个核心要素：肌纤维的状态和水含量\n回到上面这个提问来，我们先来看看肉越炖越烂、越炒越硬背后的原因。\n也就是说，温度是怎么影响肉里面肌纤维状态和水含量的？\n\n\n肉其实是个“水货”，肉重量的70-80%都是水。\n\n可是这个“水货”伪装的特别好，即使它里面大部分是水，你却看不出来。\n因为水不会流出来。\n为什么不流出来呢？这就跟肌肉的结构有关系了。\n\n肌肉是由一束束肌原纤维组成的，就是上图右上角的Myofibril，水就存在肌原纤维里面。\n一般情况下，水是被紧紧包裹在里面的，即使你用力挤也挤不出来。\n“时间就像肌肉里的水，你怎么挤也挤不出来”--开尔文\n但是，如果肉的温度上升的话，里面的肌球蛋白和肌动蛋白就会因为聚集而失去弹性 (蛋白变性)，这种强悍的储水能力就消失了。\n\n上图是牛肉在不同温度下逐步失水和变硬的过程，总的来说是有两轮的变化。\n第一轮变化是在115-120°F (46-49°C)开始的，肉的体积开始缩小，因为肌球蛋白开始变性聚集了；\n第二轮变化是在150-163°F (66-73°C) 开始，肉的体积开始进一步缩小，这回是肌动蛋白变性聚集了。\n在整个变化的过程中，牛肉中的肌纤维在持续的聚集、收缩，把里面储存的水“挤”了出来。\n原来被肌纤维包裹的“非自由水”变成了可以流动的“自由水”。\n所以我们在用筷子捅一下半熟的牛排，能看到红色的血水渗出来。\n\n就像上图一样，鸡肉的纤维在加热前是比较饱满的，在水煮或者焙烤后都发生了不同程度的脱水和皱缩。\n也就是说，在温度上升时肉在同时经历变熟和变老的过程。\n在原理上，食品安全和美味似乎是无法兼得的。\n但努力的吃货们总有办法把这两种冲突错开。\n\n比如我们针对肉片的大火爆炒。\n在肌肉纤维收缩之前把肉煮熟了，然后在肉汁大量流出之前熄火，尽可能地保留肉片的口感。\n但是对于厚度比较大的肉块，这样会增大肉块内外部的温差。\n比如，大火煎一块厚牛排的时候，内外部的温差可能会达到40度以上，煎完时可能会出现下图中Blue rare这样的情况。\n\n如果想做成左下角Medium rare这种效果呢？\n那就得小火慢煎，将内外部的温差控制在15度以内，这样才比较好达到外焦里嫩的效果。\n但是，对于炖煮了一两个小时的肉来说，上面的原理好像不完全适用。\n明明已经长时间加热的肉，为什么还能保持不变老呢？\n一是因为炖煮时候火候控制的比较好，水的损失比较少；\n二是有一种新的物质代替了水，赋予了肉润滑的口感。\n它就是结缔组织溶解后产生的明胶\n\n\n在长时间的炖煮中，捆绑住肌纤维束的结缔组织会发生溶解.\n这些新生成的明胶给我们的口腔提供了一种润滑的口感。\n但是，被过度加热的明胶同样会被煮干，润滑的作用也会消失。\n为什么烧完的肉反复加热会越来越老？\n那是因为水和明胶被煮干了，肉变柴了，润滑的口感也消失了。\n最典型的例子就是用微波炉加热剩菜。\n因为微波炉加热的速度太快、过程中也没法观察，所以一不留神就会出现过度加热的情况。\n用微波炉热好的肉菜，尤其是不带汤那种，拿出来时候容易会变得又干又硬。\n所以，二次加热时候同样需要注意控制火候，避免过度加热。\n这也是烧完的肉反复加热会变老的原因。\n\n总结\n\n温度是影响肉质地的关键，因为它决定这肌纤维的状态和肉的含水量。\n温度上升时，肉在同时地变熟和变老。\n大火爆炒、小火慢煎、炖煮等方法的恰当使用可以减少肉质变老。\n二度加热时候要同样注意，避免过度加热把肉煮硬。\n\nReference\n\nhttps://open.oregonstate.education/aandp/chapter/10-2-skeletal-muscle/\nHow Rare Is Too Rare When Eating A Steak? - Prime 13 Woodfire Grill\nHow Heat Affects Muscle Fibers in Meat\n哈洛德. 马基.

          "description": "我们通常以抢断和封盖来作为评价一名球员防守能力的指标，如果一个球员能够做到场均抢断封盖1+1，那么他很可能会是个不错的防守人。\n​赛季至今，除去那些出场数不足的球员，总共有13人能做到抢断封盖1+1。如果把筛选条件收紧，要求至少抢断1.7+封盖1.1，目前就只有一人达标，那就是76人前锋赛布尔。\n精英级别的防守是赛布尔在NBA立足的卖点，而在费城球队无法使用本-西蒙斯的当下，如何让赛布尔发挥能量势必会成为教练组内部讨论的重要议题。\n我们也不妨就着这一话题展开讨论，探讨赛布尔使用上的确定性。\n从2019年季后赛对位伦纳德以后，西蒙斯就确定了自己防守核心的战术地位。那么在西蒙斯缺席的当下，能否利用赛布尔的防守能力，弥补西蒙斯不在带来的影响？\n在给出答案之前，我们或许可以看看赛布尔这赛季在防守端的角色，看看他在防守端都做了些什么事情。\n比如在刚结束的对阵篮网的比赛，赛布尔就被指派了单防杜兰特的任务。赛布尔之所以能被赋予如此重要的防守职能，无非是对他防守能力的信赖，而他的能力也有数据支撑：赛季至今，和赛布尔对位的进攻球员平均命中率只有35.4%。\n\n\n\n你也可以看到，即便是强如杜兰特，对上赛布尔也很少采用拉开一对一的方式，因为赛布尔足够强壮，可以顶住进攻球员的背身；横移速度够快，也不吃晃，想拉开强突不容易，同时有一对长臂和不俗的瞬间爆发力来干扰进攻球员的投篮，想要一对一占到便宜实在很难。\n或许下面这个进攻回合，你可以感受到赛布尔单防的压力：当杜兰特原地干拔投篮，赛布尔顺势举手上前干扰，而他举手干扰的高度是真的可以挡到杜兰特投篮视野的。\n杜兰特投篮被干扰的情景，好像不常见吧？\n\n\n\n杜兰特当然知道防他的小伙子是个强者，所以他也没有非要用一对一这种吃力不讨好的方式展开进攻。\n面对赛布尔的防守，杜兰特更多是采用无球跑动甩开，再接队友的传球攻筐，或者持球利用队友设置的掩护，借此绕开赛布尔的…",

          "description": "电影《雄狮少年》今天终于上映了！从2019年到今天，经过两年多的时间，今天终于要和大家见面了，关于对于这部电影的评价，我想把它交给观众。今天我想跟大家分享一下这部电影一些创作点滴和自己的一些背景。\n根据我们故事的风格和特点，我们整个美术风格是偏写实的，卡通程度没有那么高。镜头里的场景，光影，氛围都在尽量还原真实的岭南村庄。而我们的角色必须融入这个环境，没有违和感，而且用他们演绎一个这么烟火气的故事必须可信。\n狮头我们完全是按照真实狮头来的，没有加入过多设计，因为我们觉得真实狮头的设计就已经非常经典了。而真实的南派狮头是有多种风格的，因此我们在电影里采用了三种不用造型的狮头：“传统狮头”（陈壮成、年轻时的咸鱼强使用的狮头）“新派狮头”（阿娟使用的狮头）和“鹤山狮头”（无极狮队使用的狮头）\n\n\n关于人物\n\n刚开始尝试了很多版本，每个角色大概都有7-8稿吧，有些设计是很成熟的，但总觉得没有画出我们心中那种有烟火气的市井的感觉。\n后来我们找到了光圈，他的设计风格正好和我们的需求完美契合，每个角色几乎都是第一稿就能确定方向。\n最终定版人物形象的原因：小人物的故事、突出小人物的朴素感、结合故事背景是乡村少年、故事中的人物最终也要打破偏见\n\n\n关于场景\n\n因为我们大部分故事是发生在乡下，所以我们跑遍了广州周边各种村落。\n最后我们在顺德找到了两个最符合我们想象的村子：百丈村和北水村，这里有鱼塘，村里的房子就散布在大大小小的鱼塘上，非常漂亮。而且还有一些很有历史的祠堂和老宅子，最重要的是，这里还有很多村民居住，很有生活气息。\n\n有些村子虽然很有历史，但已经变成旅游景点，村民基本已经不在那里生活了，感觉只剩一个壳，没有灵魂了。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n然后我团队就开始一遍遍去这两个村子里采风，搜集各种村民生活的细节，还有了解村里的植被，南方乡村的植被是很有特点的，非常丰富。\n我们要了解这里植被的种类，墙上的青苔是怎样的，缝隙里的小草是怎样的，有哪些常见的树，怎样分布的。\n\n\n\n\n还有这些植物的四季变化，因为我们故事的时间跨度有一年多，我们的采风也持续了一年。\n同时我们还开发了一系列的技术流程去呈现这些内容，为了研究木棉的生长规律，我们特效总监甚至把电脑搬去一棵木棉树下去工作了两天。\n\n最后呈现出来的效果我们都非常满意，观看有些画面时甚至都能闻到村子里的味道。大家都觉得这些付出很值得。\n\n\n关于舞狮\n\n首先是动作的问题，舞狮有很多技巧，专业性很强，要通过肢体动作去表现狮子各种各样的神态，之前我们是完全不了解的。为了弥补这个问题，我们导演组和动画师特意去专业的舞狮队做了培训，然后才开始设计舞狮相关的动作场面。为了打起来更漂亮，我们还融合了一些武术和舞蹈动作，做了适当的夸张。\n然后就是布料和毛发的解算问题，狮子身上的毛发非常多，而且是多层布料解算（舞狮队员身上有衣服，然后外面还要披上狮尾），再加上狮尾复杂的剪裁方式（现代的狮尾结构很复杂，中间还加了橡皮筋增加弹性，在舞狮的时候可以伸缩）是一个非常复杂的系统工程。我们都一一作了仔细的研究和测试，最终在三维软件中模拟出完美的动态。\n最后就是渲染，毛发渲染一向是三维渲染中最耗时的工作之一，一两头狮子还好。但我们的决赛有130多头狮子出现，现场看台上有1800多个观众，再加上公园里围观的1000多名游客，还有大量茂密的植被......想想就是一件很可怕的事情，最初我们都不确定能不能渲染出来，我们做了大量的研究和开发工作才能保证决赛镜头的顺利渲染。\n我们这部电影在条件有限的情况下，大家都憋足了一口气要做最棒的作品，这种感觉太棒了，能和他们一起创作是我的荣幸。\n\n要特别说一句的是我们音乐总监栾慧，他为了这部作品推掉了很多工作，专门从东北老家来到广州在我们楼下宾馆里搭建了一个工作室和我们一起工作了半年多，所以这次我们的音乐和画面契合度非常高，因为我随时都能下楼和他一起讨论关于音乐的想法，而且他随时都能上楼看到我们最新的画面，甚至有很多重要戏份的剪辑都是根据他的音乐，我和他一起做了精确的调整，达到音乐和画面的完美匹配。\n而且我们在制作中经历了疫情封锁，我们公司所在的芳村正好处于疫情中心，一夜之间整个区域停止一切活动，我们只能居家办公，也因此导致了制作的延期，当时的绝望情绪现在还历历在目，还好政府迅速控制住了疫情，而我们也利用这次延期的机会做了一些很重要的修改，让我们的作品更进一步，也算是因祸得福吧。\n   很荣幸这一路遇到了很多志同道合的朋友们，也感谢那些与我们素未谋面的观众们的喜爱和支持。希望更多人也能关注到我们国产原创动画，也希望中国传统文化被更多年轻人追逐。\n\n\n孙海鹏\n点击下载\n1060 个回答，查看全部。\n动画电影《雄狮少年》中有哪些彩蛋？\n《雄狮少年》代表了国产动画电影发展的新思路吗？",

          "description": "想来聊点背后的故事。或许有生之年很难再遇上像2020东京奥运一样的情形了（也别再来了）。\n 备赛四年变五年。记不清是央视采访哪位运动员来着，她说，“那天一早去训练馆，瞅着倒计时牌从100多天跳成了400多天。一下泄了劲儿，特崩溃”。100%的真实回应，不分项目，也无关国籍。\n就我而言，多出来的一年，比前面四年难得多的多。撇开年龄和体能，最大的顾虑是家庭。因为疫情，得全封闭训练。其实我家就住天津，离不远的，两个女儿都还小外加老人，本是最需要我的时候，担子却全落在了妻子身上。\n艳子曾经也是一名举重运动员，所有的纠结和挣扎她最懂。后来，她反倒跑来宽慰我说，“就暂时把你交给国家了。（其他）别担心。”这话，是真扎到我心里了，同时也是继续坚持的最大动力。\n 说回备战，变化很多。先是时隔20年首次级别调整。我那会考虑到岁数大之后你降体重，肯定对各方面有影响。索性打81，上了4公斤。但实际上，我和余导对把增加的体重转换成更稳定的技术这方面，什么经验都没有。\n 东奥最棘手还有个什么呢，是国际举联修改的新积分规则，要求必须在2018年11月-2020年4月的三个比赛区间内完成6站积分赛。相当于每两个月就得打一次高强度比赛。就这段时间，我遭遇了生涯内最艰难的一场比赛。也是给自己逼到绝境的一场。\n 2019年9月的泰国芭提雅积分赛，决定拿不拿得到东奥入场券的关键比赛。抓举我开把是165，有点着急了，往前迈了两步掉了，把腰扭了。一个小关节的错位，当时没感觉太出来。第三把，我和小14岁的队友李大银都抓了171。一切就看挺举了。\n 两项间歇时，身体反应就显出来了。动不了，腰肌一下子缩到一团，弯腰都弯不下去。没办法，只能把挺举第一把从计划的200降到191，想着先保个总成绩吧。杠一扔，痛感爆发，走路都走不了，人被架着下场了。\n当时余导过来劝，要不放弃吧，别把身体搞坏了。怎么说呢，没来及想什么多的，就一条，不想放弃每一把，边趴着敷冰袋边回：“不可能，确实不能（弃）”。完了第二把直接加到了205。因为是最高重量，可以等全部人举完再上，也算是战术给自己换多点休息时间。\n 205，是刷新世界纪录的重量。完全是咬死了牙才撑起来的。杠一扔，人就往一边歪了，勉强没倒地。没多久，大银最后一把举过了206，二刷纪录。当时全场就剩我的第三把，顶了个207。这是一个我从来没有在国际比赛上挑战过的重量，但能不能去东京就此一举了。再怎么疼，也不想留遗憾，必须再试一把，给它拼了！\n\n要说犹没犹豫过腰伤呢，也犹豫，但一上台感觉就来了。也不是纯说胜负欲吧，就是想把最好的一面展现给全世界热爱举重的人看。我是真喜欢台上的感觉。\n 说到胜负欲，对2016年的里约奥运，是有的。五年来继续坚持的理由，有它一份，想再较量一把，还是有那么点不服气吧。\n 说个东奥决赛开场前的小插曲，也是后来少见开把没成的教训。权当给大伙避雷。\n 那会中国举重队已经收了三个级别的冠军，我是有压力的。后台区就一直在调情绪，调着调着感觉要爆棚了，还跑去跟余导提“要不开抓170吧”。没同意，依旧165，完了没带起来（兴奋过头随意了）。下场余导很严肃说要重视，我也跟自己说：“就两把了，不能再乱来了。”静下来一步步想动作，怎么带，怎么展。抓举成绩稳在了170。\n\n 挺举开把实话说有瞬间，闪过了2016年的画面。抬杠那下，还是有点害怕掉了的，咬牙硬顶。197一过，心态就完全放开了。第二把204，从握杠就憋足了气，完事锁定金牌后，是有点小喜悦的，趁着斗志又报了210。翻站的时候调铃没有调好，稍微歪了点，丢了。有点可惜。\n 评价什么的不敢讲，比赛很享受，但过程真的很难很难。最想说的是，这份荣誉不光属于个人，而是实实在在地属于整个中国举重队。\n 我是吕小军，一个像热爱生命一样热爱举重的中国人。\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n吕小军\n点击下载\n182 个回答，查看全部。\n2020 东京奥运举重男子组 73 公斤决赛石智勇夺金，如何评价本场比赛？\n2020 东京奥运会举重女子 87 公斤级决赛汪周雨夺金，如何评价本场比赛?",

          "description": "最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。\n\n与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。\n\n虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。\n\n\n\n游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。\n\n\n\n《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。\n最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。\n说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。\n\n虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n呆罗\n点击下载\n22 个回答，查看全部。\n纸糊的药丸是怎么生产的？\n《纸嫁衣 2 奘铃村》讲的是一个什么样的故事？",

          "description": "一证虽小，意义非凡！！\n自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。\n因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。\n退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： \n一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇\n当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。\n退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。\n\n在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。\n但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。\n\n二、光荣的象征\n 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。\n 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。\n对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。\n三、身份的证明\n 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。\n 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。\n 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。\n四、全国通用\n近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。\n而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。\n不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 \n退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。\n\n而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n三剑客\n点击下载\n8 个回答，查看全部。\n我国军人的战斗意志是不是世界最强的？\n军人不能上传照片吗？",

          "description": "大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。\n非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。\n我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。\n首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。\n\n\n\n其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~\n\n厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。\n\n对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。\n最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nNeena\n点击下载\n49 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》第108集？\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》播放量破百亿？",

          "description": "如此有价值的一个问题不光没几个人答，而且先前仅有的两个回答居然都在胡说八道……这不能忍，怒答一发。\n羽毛球世界杯赛的“停办”在历史上一共有两次，一次是1997-2005的暂时停办，一次就是2006年后至今的无限期永久停办，而这两次停办背后的原因其实是完全不同的。\n这项赛事最初的举办是在1981年——那一年的另外一个重大历史事件就是原国际羽联IBF和原世界羽联WBF正式合并成新的国际羽联IBF（也就是现在我们熟悉的新世界羽联BWF的前身），而它的首次停办是在1997年，这期间一共举办了17次比赛，但可能出乎很多人常识认知范畴之外的是，这17次比赛的主办方其实并不是世界羽联IBF，而是总部位于美国纽约的国际管理集团IMG。\n\n由此我们也可以得知，1997年的羽毛球世界杯赛停办，其背后的根本原因应当是由于作为主办方的IMG集团内部的业务变更与项目调整，尽管具体的情况目前已不得而知，但可以想见国际羽联对于这次停办的话语权应当不是很大的。\n然而新世纪以来在湖南益阳分别于2005年和2006年举办的第18和第19届世界杯赛的情况以及世界杯赛在那之后的第二次停办，其背后的原因则与前文所述大相径庭。\n\n首先不同于以往的是，这两届世界杯赛事的重启已经不再经过原本作为赛事主办方的IMG集团的点头，而是在当时由国际羽联IBF方面自行牵头、并同时联合我国的一些大型国有企业与地方私营企业（譬如中国移动和赛琪体育等）进行合作规划从而最终得以实现的，同时在性质上也被重新认定是不计世界排名积分的“邀请赛”——尽管从届数上这两次比赛仍按第18、19届世界杯进行顺延，也就是名义上仍继承了此前于1997年停办的老世界杯赛的衣钵，但由于整个比赛重启之后一直带着一股抹不去的“非正式赛事”的味道，因此在公众看来其在此后进行常态化办赛的前景始终是不明朗的。\n其次也是最主要的一点就是这两届“新世界杯”的赛制与赛事性质的定…",

          "description": "每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。\n当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。\n总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……\n\n作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。\n从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。\n\n大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。\n锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。\n\n然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。\n早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？\n据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。\n\n其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。\n以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。\n\n在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nKay King\n点击下载",

          "description": "简单谈一谈个人的看法。\n电影里的励志、鸡汤，其本身都不是原罪。重要的是，作品的励志与鸡汤是否真正地站在真实性的基础之上。只有客观而忠实地反映了真实，作品才有了励志与鸡汤的基本说服力。\n《雄狮少年》，不是完全彻底的励志向作品，而它给出的真实反映水平，也是“不完全”的：拥有了对真实表象的呈现，却未能走到表象之下。理想与现实，传统文化与当代社会，精神信仰与物质压力，一系列的冲突，也就此停留在了“足够客观的表象展现”程度上。表象客观全面，已经在同类、国产作品里颇为少有，可称“不错”；而缺乏深度细化，则阻碍了它向更优秀之处的攀登脚步，必须报以一声“遗憾”。\n\n这部作品的第一组镜头，便强化了自身的现实属性。在旁白的介绍里，舞狮是中国传统文化的象征存在，代表着曾经时代的光辉。然而，随着一句“主角却不是他”，就将现实的时代做了切换——一个长镜头跟随着骑车的男主角，扫过了破落的农村街景，以及衣衫褴褛的民众，让当代社会的时态呈现出来。曾经以舞狮为骄傲的传统时光已经不复存在，取而代之的，是在物质压力下被迫的生存之道，经济落后地区的家庭为了赚钱，家长只能背井离乡，去大城市打工，而诞生无数的留守家庭。\n包括此时出现的主角形象，都在强调着现实的因素。他不是动漫主角常有的大眼美男，而是生活里比较普遍的单眼皮少年，其后，这种形象也延伸到了女主角扁塌的鼻梁上。这样的形象，让人物彻底回归了现实感最强的“普通”之中——他没有任何突出的地方，外形都如此平庸，也就不具备所谓的“被选中之子”之类的潜藏天赋。\n而主角随后的遭遇，更是让这个信息有了更明确的落地。心怀舞狮憧憬的他，被称为病猫。而抢走他红包的舞狮队成员，一方面体现着舞狮这样的传统文化于物质化当代的变质，同时也反过来说明了舞狮衰落的原因——忙于赚钱的人们，不再对舞狮这样的东西抱有兴趣，这便让历史悠久的陈家村舞狮队，也丧失了自己本应具有的骄傲，物质功利了起来，以…",

          "description": "事实上，平台的老旧对产品品质的影响还是很重要的，所以我们在买车的时候非常有必要了解对意向车型的生产平台进行了解。\n举例，比如一款车换代车型即将上市，旧款（上一代）车型依然在售，如果这时候买了旧款就有些可惜了，相当于是买到了上一代的技术。那如果二手车呢？举个典型例子，都是登记日期在2018-2020年之间的丰田卡罗拉，价格差别不大，车况各有不同。如果你了解12代卡罗拉来自TNGA平台，11代卡罗拉于2019年7月停产，在车况和价格没有太大差别情况下，就一定要选择车身铭牌的出厂日期在2019年7月之后的12代卡罗拉(也可以看后悬架，扭力梁的都是老平台车型)。\n\n为什么？当然是冲着TNGA平台啊，比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构（更准确说法是架构）所产车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。这也就是说来自TNGA架构的第12代卡罗拉，操控性能和驾驶乐趣，包括安全性方面比上一代车型有了显著提高。同样的，这也适用于凯美瑞，只是凯美瑞两代车型之间外观内饰有明显区别，比较不容易混在一块儿（买二手车时）。\n\n尽管平台的最大意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而帮企业节省成本，但从消费者的角度，理论上，新的造车平台比旧（上一代）的更加先进和高级。因此，他也能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。\n比如说，大众现在MQB平台的车型，比上一代PQ25/35平台产品在轻量化方面就有了明显提高，用户获得的好处自然是节约了油费。前面也提到了，丰田TNGA架构下的新一代车型，操控方面都比以往有了显著提高，哪怕卡罗拉这样的标准“买菜车”，开起来也不再平庸乏味。\n再看现在流行的电动车，以往很多电动车往往是“油改电”的过渡性产品，会在电机、电池摆布、车内空间、行驶及安全品质等方面出现很多不够完善的地方，而来自全新的纯电车造车平台的电动车就很好地解决了这一问题。\n\n总的来说，新旧平台的产品尽量选新的，但凡事没绝对，某些新平台车型的某些细节甚至还不如旧平台车型，比如PQ46的斯柯达昊锐，反而比MQB平台的速派，在底盘厚重感、转向手感方面主观感受更好。此外，老款车型在产品生涯末期往往有较大优惠，如果一些产品点上的差异消费者本身也不是很敏感，那倒也没有什么。  \n\n如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。\n目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国汽研指数专家\n点击下载\n2 个回答，查看全部。\n普通消费者在选购汽车时，如何选择一台安全性更高的车型？\n有那些新车销量惨淡，二手车确异常火爆的车型？",

          "description": "我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。\n我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。\n为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。\n翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：\n随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug\n还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：\n可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动\n这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。\n展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：\n这个项目放弃前的一段录屏\n我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。\n所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n李喆\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n在使用unity独立开发游戏时，你认为实现最麻烦的是哪个系统？\n用unity开发一款游戏需要学习多少软件？",

          "description": "大家好，我是《秦时明月》的执行制片人薛小明。首先还是对各位喜欢《秦时明月》的秦迷朋友表示感谢。《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》十五周年版，已经播出第三集，相信大家都看到了一段精彩的打戏，不知道看得过瘾不过瘾。相信大家从中也能看出，我们在这个版本上花费的心血。\n\n对于这部作品的意义，正如沈导之前回答提过，这次的十五周年版是在《秦时明月》播出十五周年之际，答谢秦迷和观众朋友的一份回馈。为了更好的效果，这次《新秦时明月》的制作也有很多不易，除了用我们最新的技术提升了画面的质感和各方面的细节之外，我们还进一步提高了打戏的观感。对一部武侠作品来说，打戏毫无疑问是至关重要的。而与注重特效的影视作品不同，《秦时明月》一直是那种“拳拳到肉”的写实武学实践者，相信看完第3集的观众就更能够感受到这种风格。\n\n这一集的打戏占比是比较高的，从前面无双与项家子弟的切磋，中间少羽和无双单挑，到最后危急关头盖聂的一剑救场，可以说既还原了我们第一部的经典剧情，又增加了很多亮点。在武戏上，我们着重表现人物的特色以及更真实的打击感、紧迫感。为此，我们加快了打戏的节奏并尽可能的展现出角色见招拆招的设计，比如少羽和无双的这段打戏，无双的特点是力量强又有着钢筋铁骨，一旦被他抓住就很难脱身反击，所以少羽更多是依靠身法的灵活躲闪去进攻他的薄弱部位。且不管是无双还是少羽，所做出来的很多组合动作以及运镜都是经过不断地调整，同时是连续镜头，这样可以看出人物的连贯动作。\n\n为了这些效果，我们的武戏部会与我们的动捕演员深入交流，所以武戏这方面，我们确实是花了很多力气去做。我想这也是秦时明月传统武学的魅力之一。\n在正片的最后，大家可能注意到这是一段在旧版《秦时明月》中没有出现过的镜头，即盖聂找到天明并保护他的这段回忆。这段回忆是我们对剧情细节的一个补充，也是为了让盖聂这个角色更立体。相信通过这些细节的补充，可以让观众对盖聂为什么会叛离秦王宫的原因有了更多自己的理解。\n\n这一集中主要涉及到的点就是以上这些，后续的剧集中还会有更多精彩丰富的内容呈现，希望大家能够多多支持我们。在此也感谢粉丝和观众为我们提出的建议，之后我们一定会继续努力，为大家带来更好的作品。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n薛小明\n点击下载\n12 个回答，查看全部。\n斗罗大陆动画播放量为何远超其他大IP？\n我和朋友争论日漫和国漫到底谁制作经费更高，是不是一集3d斗破苍穹水准比一集一拳，紫罗兰烧钱？",

          "description": "作为社恐人士，看看我这小眼神就知道我是自愿回答的！\n\n\n因为直到开播前都很兴奋，所以前几天都没怎么睡，思维到现在都还有点乱，就随便闲聊下吧。\n\n\n我们跟腾讯动漫算是合作很久了，他们在我们大火鸟还没什么名气的时候就给了很多机会，加上这次能得到《大王饶命》这个项目，真的很感激也很开心。\n\n\n我还记得当初ASK老师和我第一次说这个项目的时候，我就觉得这是我们团队的荣耀，而且碰巧ASK老师和肘子老师还有我三个都是白羊座,生日还刚好挨着，就觉得这缘分也太巧了。\n\n\n说来有点不好意思，在还没见到本人前，我以为肘子老师是那种特别严肃的老人家，没想到碰面后反而有种一见如故的感觉。于是我就追着他问了很多关于小说创作的事，一番交流下来，我算是深刻地领会到了什么叫头部作者。\n\n\n光是我们这几个小时的聊天就足够让我学到了很多平时压根不可能注意的故事创作细节，而且他最厉害的就是可以在极短的时间里想到一段非常有意思的梗，大王第一话开头的吕树怼糖葫芦师傅就是肘子老师几分钟内蹦出来的创意，真的是让人非常佩服。\n\n\n话说回来，虽说能接到这个项目很让人兴奋，但兴奋劲过头随之而来的就是不安了。因为这部小说的知名度很高，加上肘子老师对我们的期待很高，所以我们必须拿出全部实力去完成它才行。\n\n\n最终在燃尽了全部精力后，作品顺利上线了，从那刻起，我心里的不安也就渐渐消散了，真心希望大家能够喜欢上《大王饶命》的动画版。\n\n\n说起动画版的亮点，这两天被大家热议的OP肯定是一个重头戏。实话实说，其实我并没有刻意去做什么布局之类的、与创作无关的事。我只是给了一群爱玩的朋友一个足够的空间，让大家可以在其中尽情玩耍，玩得开心。\n\n\n我确实没想到会火到这个程度，毕竟我每次做OP/ED的初衷就是让创作者尽情表达自己的创作欲，我相信只有完全释放激情和灵感的作品才是好作品。这也是我为什么特别喜欢跟无念聊创作的事，因为每当我跟他聊起OP时，我能够感受到他眼里是有光的，这是他真心喜欢做的东西，就像他说在制作过程里并没有遇到什么太大的难题，反而更像是水到渠成。\n\n\n至于正片内容，对我来说比较难的是如何让吕树的怼人场景比较贴合我们的现实世界，因为如果过度追求搞笑效果的话，很容易就会变成那种烂大街的搞笑喜剧。然而这部作品的内核并不是搞笑，所以我们最初开始制作的时候就定下了偏写实的方向，只有这样才能让吕树这个角色显得更加立体。在初期讨论时尤其让我最印象深刻的是ASK老师说“麻烦导演你把第一季做的穷一些，要那种从里到外的穷感。”\n\n\n真是让人头大.jpg。\n\n\n一部好剧肯定少不了好细节，我们现在每次要制作新作时，在正式开始前都会去相关地点进行场景、道具的取材，《大王饶命》也不例外，这次为了构建出吕树的房子，我们收集了相当多的资料，所以最后出来的场景美术设定所有人看了都很满意。比较可惜的是我们没能赶上庙会的时间，所以没能体会到原汁原味的庙会氛围，有点可惜。\n\n\n除了吕树的房子外，像是比较重要的学校场景也在精心收集了很多资料后对它进行了高度的还原，尤其是道元班的设计，我是真的苦恼了很久，最终才定下了方案。而且因为疫情的缘故，在取材结束后我们就匆匆回到了广州，在那之后因为各种原因也没能再去一次，所以后面的很多场景就只能参考之前拍的照片，通过回忆和讨论尽可能地还原了。\n\n\n最后，再次感谢腾讯动漫，谢谢肘子老师，给了我们这次参与《大王饶命》动画化项目的机会！\n\n\n\n危天行\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价7doc七创社的新作品《凹凸世界》？\n如何评价《镜双城》正式动画化？",

Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world's tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn't see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town. Everyone has filmed with this trampoline tower from @David Dobrik, @Drew Dirksen, @Bryce Hall, @Jordan Matter, @Unspeakable, @Ben Azelart and …",

          "description": "Today we completely break Cuphead speedruns by using the Mugman Army glitch. This glitch allows us to spawn unlimited Mugman clones, and can results in some extremely fast fights. This speedrun is one of my favorites\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the world record run here: https://youtu.be/WOvPL91CKTc\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nThis speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",

The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz).

When Maximus makes his first appearance in the Colosseum, he asks the men fighting with him if any of them “ever served in the army” to which one replies that he served with him at Vindobona. This shows that even though Maximus has been trying to keep his identity a secret, at least one other prisoner has known who he was the entire time and never said a thing, because that’s how much respect Maximus commanded from his men.\n#moviedetails #gladiator #movielogic",

Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. \n\nCaptain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.",

You can check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg\n\nHere is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I’ve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own — and though I’m not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??\n\nAlso, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron & I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea & Megan for letting us film at your store!\n\nCheck out our new merch here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com/\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

This mission is scheduled to lift off at 7:20 a.m. EST (12:20 UTC), Dec. 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.\n\nWith revolutionary technology, Webb will observe a part of space and time never seen before, providing a wealth of amazing views into an era when the very first stars and galaxies formed––over 13.5 billion years ago.\n\nIt can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and study the atmospheres of distant worlds. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more! It’s the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built.\n\nWebb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make Webb a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries!\n \nReady to #UnfoldTheUniverse?

The song was played as part of the Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, a carol service that reflected upon the difficult past 18 months for people across our nation, and particularly for those who might be more vulnerable, isolated or have limited access to support.\n\n#TogetherAtChristmas was a moment to recognise those who have struggled during the pandemic, as well as to celebrate the individuals and organisations who carried out inspirational acts of kindness and incredible feats to help those in need in our communities. \n\nWith thanks to Tom Walker: https://www.youtube.com/c/iamtomwalker\n\nWatch more:\nMental Health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEarly Years: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEngagements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBeZm...\n\nFollow us on our other channels:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dukeandduchessofcambridge\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal",

I've built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob's house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I've never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “Fortnite Chapter 3!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a Real Life Fortnite Battle Bus to celebrate the release of Fortnite Chapter 3!",

The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

          "description": "In the opening round of the 2021 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods card a 10-under 62 to sit three shots back after Saturday in Orlando.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThis week’s PNC Championship will see Tiger Woods return to action for the first time since the PNC Championship last year. The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

With a career built for this very moment, the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nick Cage.",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok \"For You Page\"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?\n\nThanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!\nYou can check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/kayleymelissa\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: hhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nMadi Price\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",
