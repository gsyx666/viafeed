'exp 1' : 'exp 2'); // exp 1\n\nSince we defined a variable called condition as true, the ternary operator executes the first expression which is a simple string \"exp 1\". \nThe console.log() around the ternary operator logs the result of the ternary operator and it logs \"exp 1\".\nAs I said above, you can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. But this is not entirely accurate!\nSo, what is the problem?\nWhen talking about Javascript Ternary Operator, MDN talks about truthy and falsy instead of true and false.\ncondition ? expression1 : expression2\n\nIF the condition is truthy execute expression1 else (falsy) execute expression2.\nIn simple terms, \nTruthy values are equal or can be converted to true.

Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.\nSample code showing a simple Set object usage:\nfunction main() {\n\n    const gameScreen = document.getElementById('game-screen')\n    gameScreen.addEventListener('click' updateAction)\n\n    const cursorPositions = new Set()\n    function updateAction(event) {\n      let position = {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}\n      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case\n    }\n    // use unique cursorPositions below\n}\n\nwhile(true) {\n  main()\n}\n\nDuplicate values are discarded when added to a set. This is useful for capturing and storing unique values where duplicate values are not needed.\nconst letters = new Set()\nletters.add('A')\nletters.add('B')\nletters.add('A') // duplicate entry is ignored\nconsole.log(letters) // Set {2} {'A', 'B'} \n\nThe set object provides a way of storing data where duplicate values are not required.\nNote: Most languages including JavaScript offer a lot of language features but it’s not a good approach to try learning all these language features at a go.

          "description": "So, approximately 3 years ago I posted my first entry which tackled the question of what should I go next on my web developer career. \nAt the time, I had finished a mid-size project with my employer, with the opportunity to choose a tech stack, design and develop the architecture of the application. It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.\nAnyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that's the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.\nWell then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for \"production\"). \nHopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).\nI don't think it's necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn. So now the next step is to take this experience and continue the journey. It's still just the beginning.",

We then create a new XMLHttpRequest object. We open the GET request and set the URL. We also set the true parameter, which ensures that the request is made asynchronously.\nWe then define two functions, onload and onerror . onload will be executed when the request is loaded, while onerror will be executed if there is an error. We then send the request.\nIf the request is successful, we will get the response body. We will then extract the data from the body and log it to the console. \nYou can try running the code in your browser.

It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. \nOne of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. \nSvelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient. If you are looking for a new JavaScript framework, Svelte is definitely worth considering. \nThanks for reading!\nKindly follow me for more topics on Svelte https://GitHub.com/yakumwamba\nTwitter.com/brianlemba",

Been a minute, but I'm back with another CSS tutorial!\nThis one will be pretty quick, but should give you a great launch point for extrapolating and creating something special.\nNow you probably know that you can add borders to specific sides of an element, using, for instance:\n.border-top {\n    border-top: 1px solid white;\n}\n\nResult:\n\nBut what you may not realize, is what happens when you add a very simple additional property: border-radius! Now, maybe this sounds super obvious, but just how cool it is, isn't obvious until you see it in action, so let's do that:\n.border-top-round {\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    border-top: 1px solid white;\n}\n\nResult:\n\nCool, isn't it? No?\nWell let's make it so!\nIf the first bit wasn't all that impressive, maybe adding a little fun and flare should do the trick.\nCheck it out!\n\n\n\n\nSo what's the code for this one?

For example, we were always encouraged and rewarded for working together, speaking up, or asking questions in schools.

          "description": "先说结论：\n目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。\n\n\n正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。\n事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。\n无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。\n针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。\n他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。\n这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。\n除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 \n简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。\n\n\n但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。\n所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。\n但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。\nSAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: \n\n当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。\n因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。\n驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…\n而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…\n双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。\n\n\n更多的的讨论可以关注我之前的一些回答：\n南京一特斯拉司机早高峰开自动驾驶脱把睡觉，这一行为违法吗？如何看待目前的「自动驾驶」技术？\nL5 真的能实现吗？或者说，未来无人驾驶真的会成为常态吗？\n如果未来交通工具都是自动驾驶，你能做到安心出行吗？\n复旦教授杨珉公开质疑理想汽车「自动驾驶安全性没有想象的那么香，事关人命」，目前阶段的自动驾驶靠谱吗？\n\n\n以及这个视频：\n【德国博士】完全无人驾驶有可能实现么？L5安全性悖论及未来智慧城市出行的展望\n\n参考文献\n\nhttps://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/self-driving-car-statistics/\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety\n\n\n留德华叫兽\n点击下载\n86 个回答，查看全部。\n喝了酒以后，让特斯拉自动驾驶，算酒驾吗？\n美国的联邦法律是如何产生的？",

          "description": "将汽车轮胎按照地区分类，大致可以分为欧洲、北美、日韩、东南亚、中国。轮胎和所在地汽车工业息息相关，甚至间接决定了品牌定位。\n典型如韩国，韩国汽车产品定位亲民家用，韩泰、锦湖也比较注重这方面。日本和美国是汽车老牌大国，两国汽车市场高度捆绑，所以两国轮胎品牌也主要以经济和越野为主。中国和东南亚地区的轮胎品牌，也都根据当地的汽车企业定位，诞生了比如玛吉斯、佳通、朝阳、玲珑等主要轮胎品牌。\n欧洲有些不同的是，作为汽车的发源地，大量的运动赛事和跑车、豪华、家用、经济型汽车的全方位涉足，使得欧洲诞生了诸多性能顶级、品类全面的轮胎品牌，包括大家耳熟能详的德国马牌、米其林和倍耐力等。\n\n\n选择合适的轮胎前，先搞清楚需求。\n大多数轮胎品牌都有从上到下全面的布局，有经济、豪华、舒适、性能等各个系列，所以如果不是完全家用、经济趋向的车型，售价在15万以上，对操控、静音有些要求时就可以重点考虑欧洲品牌了。\n问题是，一款轮胎不可能方方面面做到尽善尽美，如果有，那就是方方面面都不是最好。\n如果在意成本，应该侧重考虑耐磨，但是耐磨一定程度上会影响舒适性和操控性，噪音也会增加。对于一些非入门车型来说有些得不偿失。出租车一般会倾向选择耐磨轮胎。\n如果在意性能，比如领克03+、高尔夫GTI、宝马240i这一类的车子，需要重点考虑抓地力。抓地力好的轮胎可以有效提升车辆极限，相应的耐磨会变差。如果为了迁就耐磨，整车性能得不到发挥，事实上会造成更大的浪费。\n\n\n如果是商务出行，比如别克GL8、奔驰V一类的车型，需要重点考虑舒适性。\n如果是新能源车型或者豪华轿车，由于先天出色的静谧性或者对静谧性的高要求，应该侧重静谧性选择轮胎，以获得更加安静的乘坐感受。\n有了需求就可以按图索骥选择产品了。多数汽车品牌有明确的系列划分，要理解一点都不困难，比如德国马牌旗下一共有三个大类：全能、运动和越野，命名规则是Conti-XXXX…",

          "description": "何为黑色电影之黑\n法国影评人定义了黑色电影，他们从四十年代美国电影中归纳出这种风格。到五十年代末，奥逊·威尔斯执导的[历劫佳人]宣告了经典黑色电影时期的终结，随之而来的是所谓的新黑色电影——彩色取代黑白、黑色元素和主题融入某个类型化叙事中——犯罪、惊悚、科幻、恐怖等。黑色电影概念包含了一系列视觉和影像风格以及特定的主题——犯罪和荒诞。所谓黑色，既强调视觉，也强调叙事和主题。\n\n从社会性源起来说，黑色电影是对二三十年代约翰·福特、弗兰克·卡普拉等导演所信奉的美国中产社会价值的反叛。底层、中产阶级、警察、女人等，或是陷入腐化堕落的罪恶环境，或是走向犯罪深渊。黑色电影虽然鲜少直接谈论宏大的政治、社会问题，但它们或多或少从这些问题中，产生了创作的冲动和灵感。源自人性的贪婪和腐败是导致主角犯罪或堕落的根本原因。\n回看美国经典黑色电影，“黑色”之意并不难领略。它们大多是讲犯罪故事，或是与人性的阴暗面有关，让人感到既危险又迷人。主角只是普通人，而非穷凶极恶的帮派人物，或是被逼无奈的反抗者。\n一般来说，1941年的[马耳他之鹰]在好莱坞刮起了黑色电影之风。从类型上来看，它是一部侦探电影，但具备了与该类型电影不同的黑色主题——不是聚焦于一般意义上的犯罪或悬疑解密，而是透过侦探之手，发现罪恶背后，道德和人性的失衡。\n\n当侦探、女主和犯罪团伙的老大围在传说中用金子制作的马耳他之鹰周围时，他们的目光聚集了贪欲，但影片在此又狠狠黑色了一把：众人搭上几条性命，互相欺骗和斗争而争夺回来的宝物，却是一文不值的东西。\n这种历经千帆后，被宿命击中的荒诞，亦是黑色电影迷人的地方。与女主暧昧的侦探，最终向警察告发了她的罪行。这是早期黑色电影的“保守”之处(因为海斯法典，好莱坞当时对性、变态、犯罪、暴力的表现还有很多禁忌)，摇摆的道德最后要回到正轨，作恶者自食其果。\n在[双重赔偿][失去的周末]和[日落大道]里，导…",

          "description": "很多问题不只有一种答案，比如这一个。\n既可以就全新蒙迪欧设计和竞争力作答，也可以就全新蒙迪欧演变以及为何这般作答。两个答案都可以回答这个问题。只不过第一种回答是「鱼」，第二种回答是「渔」，需要读者自行判断，提炼答案。\n我们尝试以第二种回答方式入手。\n全新蒙迪欧并不是一款出人意料的车。\n未真正亮相前，全新蒙迪欧大抵会有两种结果：一、由美国人（欧洲人）操刀继续做这款车真正意义上的迭代，在中美两国市场投放；二、按照EVOS的外观设计，衍生出轿车版的中级轿车，并命名为蒙迪欧。\n关于全新蒙迪欧外观，实际上已经建立了两种预期，剩下的就是待全新蒙迪欧揭晓，告诉我们最终选择了哪一种。这就是为什么没有出人意料。\n回过头去，美国人设计的蒙迪欧会是什么样子？\n如果推测美国人设计的蒙迪欧，就必须先回到全新一代福克斯以及即将中期改款的福克斯上来。这是一款非常重要的车子。\n2018年，全新一代福克斯在中国上市。作为福特全球车型，福克斯没有太多中国市场的元素。当时福特在中国的设计中心也没有成立，但随着福特中国战略的逐步推进，在福克斯这款车上，看到了越来越多的中国元素。\n现在的福克斯拥有两套设计，一种为标准版，小开嘴、三角灯，大灯中间回形标；另一种是猎装版，大灯保持不变，但中网开始靠近EVOS以及蒙迪欧。\n\n\n中控也是如此。新福克斯上市时采用了全球统一的内饰，但福特中国研发出了SYNC+车机系统之后，福特在华销售的车型都同步更换了这套车机，以至于个别车型出现了些审美上的问题。\n\n\n按照历代福克斯和蒙迪欧之间设计上的关联，海外媒体的好事者曾经做出过下一代产品的假想图，只是这个假想图在今天看来，变成了Mustang Mach-E，但蒙迪欧也可以是这样。\n\n\n\n那么，为什么会出现这种情况？\n大的原因是——\n中国市场和美国市场在消费需求上正在割裂，表现为通用、福特全力推动SUV品类的建设，逐步取消了轿车产品的研发…",

          "description": "《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。\n我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。\n音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。\n\n\n关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n妖刀王\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\nCOMIC LO杂志前一百期有哪些经典内容？\n如何制作一张好的学术海报（poster）？",

          "description": "三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。\n\nWTCR是什么\n讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。\n\n拿到WTCR冠军有多难？\n既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。\n\n摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。\n\n有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。\n\n这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.\n\n在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。\n\n拿到这个冠军有什么意义？\n一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。\n\n在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。\n\n中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。\n\n对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。\n\n对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。\n\n而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n鲁超\n点击下载\n9 个回答，查看全部。\n领克02hatchback和领克032.0冠军版怎么选？\n领克03冠军版与03+驭风版你会选择那个？",

          "description": "看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧\n先上个答案：会也不会\n我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是16岁拿的驾照17岁买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车，没有国内驾驶经验但是北美交规和限速也差不多。总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的，在两个方面都有足够的经验可以说明问题。\n我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。\n赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。\n公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。\n加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…\n至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…\n总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nCoalescence\n点击下载\n37 个回答，查看全部。\n赛车手需要学习漂移吗？\n如果中国有一条不限速的直道公路，你愿意来飙车车吗？",

          "description": "System76 分享了其即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板草图。看起来令人惊叹！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nSystem76 令人兴奋的用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的开发工作现在正在进行中。\n\r\n虽然我们已经用早期的代码 试过了，但我们现在可以看到更多的东西。从其 GitHub 仓库 和 Figma 文档 的一些原型中，我们可以看到它的更多信息。\n\r\n值得注意的是，我们可以看到顶部面板和系统托盘，正如你在 COSMIC 桌面上所期望的那样。\n\r\n这仍是一项正在进行的工作，可能会有变化。\n\r\nCOSMIC 桌面的顶部面板\n\r\nPop!_OS 依赖于 GNOME 扩展来通过顶部面板或系统托盘图标提供更多的功能。\n\r\n随着即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面，看起来他们正在创建新的小程序，与当前的外观相融合，并提供更多的功能。\n\r\n开发者 Eduardo Flores 分解研究 了它，发现了关键的区别以及 System76 的目标是如何使其发挥作用。\n\r\n而且，这也是它更有趣的地方：\n\r\n\r\n看起来 System76 正在摆脱传统的“扩展”，计划为第三方小程序设计一个 API，这与 KDE、XFce 和其他公司的做法类似。\n\r\n这是一个令人兴奋的消息，将使 COSMIC 成为一个更强大的桌面环境，使其可以扩展和定制。\n\r\n\r\n另外，似乎这些小程序也可以和顶部面板一起放在坞站里。我们会在其未来的某个测试版中看到更多的实际情况。\n\r\n在这里，让我重点介绍一下从现有的草图中观察到的基本变化：\n\r\n1、声音小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n与我们现在所拥有的相比，COSMIC 的目标是增加细化的控制，如选择输入/输出设备、在顶部面板上切换媒体控制的选项、控制媒体播放，以及访问声音设置。\n\r\n虽然草图没有显示专辑封面，但在发布前会包括它。\n\r\n作为参考，以下是 Pop!_OS 顶部面板选项现在的样子。\n\r\n\n\r\n2、电源小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n很高兴看到有一个专门的电源按钮来快速访问系统设置、锁屏和注销。\n\r\n另外，暂停、重启和关机的按钮应该可以提高可用性，关闭计算机不用额外的点击。\n\r\n3、网络小程序\n\r\n虽然你可以很容易地打开或关闭有线、无线网络，但会弹出一个占据了整个屏幕的单独窗口来选择 Wi-Fi 网络并输入密码。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，看起来我们终于可以在这里输入密码，连接到可用的无线网络，并重试失败的连接，而不必从活动窗口分心。所有这些都发生在系统托盘上的网络小程序上，如上面的截图所示。\n\r\n同样，你可以看到关于你的有线连接的更多信息，包括 IP 地址和速度。\n\r\n4、日期、时间和日历小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n最重要的日历小程序看起来更加实用，信息量更大。通知区不再驻留在这里（它现在有一个单独的小程序），使它的体验更干净，可以把注意力放在你关注的东西上。\n\r\n一些细微的视觉改进，比如用重点颜色来突出日历中的某一行，应该会使它更容易理解。\n\r\n5、通知中心\n\r\n\n\r\n正如我前面提到的，通知现在有一个独立的空间。通知小程序会将所有的通知堆积起来，并允许你在需要时展开它们，或者将它们全部清除。\n\r\n我们仍然有“请勿打扰”开关，并可以快速访问通知设置。\n\r\n6、图形模式小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n这对笔记本电脑用户来说应该是非常有用的，可以在图形模式之间无缝切换，并可以看到当前使用的哪种模式。\n\r\n除了所有这些，还有一个蓝牙小程序、一个电池电源模式小程序，以及一些其他的东西，比如改变输入语言或输入源的能力。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n鉴于这是初次看到使用 Rust 开发 COSMIC 桌面顶部面板的外观，看来我们有很多东西要去看了。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n总的来说，System76 正准备为我们提供一个高度可定制但又简化的 COSMIC 桌面版本。\n\r\n而所有这些都应该有助于形成一种独特的桌面体验。当然，明年你就得在 Pop!_OS 中和 GNOME 说再见了。\n\r\n你怎么看？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/system76-cosmic-panel/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "POSIX，你肯定在各种在线论坛和文章中，听到过这个缩写，或读到过关于它的信息。程序员和系统开发人员似乎最关心这个问题。它听起来很神秘，虽然有很多关于这个主题的好资料，但一些讨论区（简洁是它们的特点）并没有详细说明它是什么，这可能会让人困扰。那么，POSIX 到底是什么？\n\r\n\n\r\nPOSIX 简介\n\r\n与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。\n\r\n当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。\n\r\n该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。\n\r\n为什么有 POSIX？\n\r\n一句话：可移植性。\n\r\n60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。\n\r\nIBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。\n\r\n不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…",

          "description": "为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。\n我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。\n为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。\n短信转发至 iPhone 效果\n在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App\n🔗 下载地址：App Store\nBark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 > Bark 服务端 > 苹果 APNs 服务器 > 你的设备 > Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。\n第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。\nBark App\n在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder\n🔗 下载地址：酷安\nSmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。\n打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。\n将Bark设置为发送通道\n返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。\n设置短信转发规则\n除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。\n为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️\n出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。\n示例：realme UI 后台权限设置\n出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。\nrealme UI 验证码安全保护\n将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac\n根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。\n总结\n得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。\n如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n扫码分享",

          "description": "44670: 由于直接用密码不方便并且不安全，相信很多人都会配置使用公私钥来登录 SSH 主机。\n然而，直接在电脑里存储私钥文件实际上是非常不安全的：电脑上任何一个能读取用户目录的软件都有可能偷走私钥然后做坏事。\n比较可信赖的方式是做一个专门的 USB Key 设备，实现 SSH 登录时用到的公私钥认证算法，这样一来电脑上就不会存储私钥了。\nYubiKey 支持 SSH 登录，但是除了价格问题以外，另一个问题是 YubiKey 对 SSH 登录的支持不是原生的，在 Windows 下需要依赖 Windows Crypto API/SmartCard API 这些黑箱，其它平台上也需要 OpenPGP 这样的软件套一至多层实现，配置起来可能会很复杂并且总觉得不够可靠。\n所以我觉得有必要自己做一个专门用于登录 SSH 的 USB Key ，并且尽量简化功能和降低成本。\n基于以下几点原因，最后选择了 ESP32/ESP32-C3 芯片：\n1. ESP32 系列自带安全启动、存储加密功能，一定程度上可以防止硬件上的秘密被物理读取。\n2. 价格非常便宜，目前淘宝上卖得最多的一家 ESP32-C3 开发板只需 9.9 元（限购 10 件）。\n3. 有 WiFi/BLE 功能，未来或许可以做成无线的。\n已经在 ESP32 开发板上测试通过，几乎所有的 ESP32/ESP32-C3 开发板都可以直接使用。\n也在计划做自己的硬件，打算提供一个带灯的按钮，用户按下物理按钮可以确认登录操作。\nPC 端用 Go 实现了一个 ssh-agent ，可以转发 SSH 身份认证请求到设备端、由设备端完成签名操作。\n特点：\n1. 设备端只专注 ed25519 签名一件事情，代码<1K LOC （不含第三方库），容易审计。\n2. 私钥完全在设备端产生，不会传递到外部，不依赖 Windows Crypto API/SmartCard API 之类的黑箱。\n3. 私钥通过 SHA256 算法，结合设备端存储的随机种子+用户密码产生。设备本身不存储 /验证某个特定的用户密码，用户每次输入不同的密码即可以直接使用不同的 ed25519 公私钥对。\n4. 使用外部的独立 USB 转串口芯片，避免软件 USB 协议栈的潜在漏洞影响设备的安全性。\n5. 可以通过单一的 Go 写的工具，实现设备的初始化、ssh-agent 等全部功能，不需要安装额外的软件。\n使用方法：\n1. 安装 ESP-IDF 环境、构建 44Key 项目后刷入任意一个 ESP32/ESP32-C3 开发板里。\n2. 运行 44KeyTool -port COMx -format ，初始化设备。需要在键盘上随便输入些字符，用于给设备端生成随机种子提供一部分熵。（在设备管理器里确认具体的串口号，替换 COMx ）\n3. 运行 44KeyTool -port COMx ，输入自己的密码后，即可开启 ssh-agent ，此时终端会显示输出公钥。\n4. 把公钥添加到目标服务器的~/.ssh/authorized_keys ，下次就可以直接用 USB Key 登录啦。\n项目地址：\n硬件（准备中）： https://oshwhub.com/44670/miniusbkey\n固件： https://github.com/44670/44Key\nPC 端软件： https://github.com/44670/44KeyTool\n目前是一个可以在 Windows 上工作的原型，实现了 SSH 认证所需的全部功能，不过安全启动和存储加密还没默认启用。\n欢迎提供各种想法！",

          "description": "TongTX: “下午 2-3 点我需要占用测试环境联调项目，大家不要发布喔！”\n看到群里的消息我内心一阵苦恼，由于公司使用的是微服务架构并将其部署在了 Kubernetes 集群上，因此团队负责开发的服务是整个微服务架构其中的一环，整个系统的正常运行需要依赖微服务系统中的上下游服务，这导致每每到了发新版本的窗口期，大家都开始占用测试环境联调测试自己开发的功能，导致排队使用测试环境的情况。\n今天是发版日，我也需要将自己的功能发布至测试环境验证功能是否正确，有人占用测试环境的话会导致我无法随意测试与修复功能，排队使用测试环境会影响我的发布效率，到时候又要被产品经理吐槽上线慢了:(\n“那我安排在 3-4 点” 团队里另一名工程师在群里说。\n看到测试环境的使用时间不断被挤压，我也顾不上是否需真要用一个小时，赶紧在群里喊“我预期 5 点开 PR 合并代码，所以 4-5 点我要测试一下，用好了会通知大家。”\n想必各位使用微服务架构的同仁和我有一样的困扰，那就是“集成测试联调真的太他丫讨厌了！”，尤其一到发新版本的窗口期，测试环境简直犹如网红餐厅，大排长龙，各个功能都要测，只能乖乖等。很多公司和我在的这家企业一样，只有一套测试环境，一到发版前各个项目时间都很紧，全挤一起。尤其现在敏捷开发迭代周期越来越短，测试也越来越频繁，测试环境着实是不够用啊。\n于是我去找了找目前有没有能解决这个问题的方案，发现有一些工具链可以解决这个排队耗时问题，比如 TeamCode( https://www.teamcode.com)新推出的微服务集成测试工具 KubeOrbit( https://www.kubeorbit.io)，帮助团队高效测试微服务。\n我打开他发来的产品文档，发现此工具允许我在公司测试环境的 Kubernetes 集群中定义基准环境：\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment version=base\n我还可以基于基准环境创建不同的测试通道，比如测试环境 1 和测试环境 2：\n# Create a test env with name v1\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version=v1\n# Create a test env with name v2\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version=v2\n将自己的服务加入目标测试环境\napiVersion: network.kubeorbit.io/v1alpha1\nkind: ServiceRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: serviceroute-sample\n  namespace: sample-namespace\nspec:\n  name: pod-svc\n  # Add your service to the test env named with v1 by defining trafficRoutes\n  trafficRoutes:\n    routes:\n      - name: v1\n        labels:\n          version: v1\n        headers:\n          version:\n            exact: v1\n    default:\n      version: base\n部署到目标测试环境中   \nkubectl apply -f /path/to/your/serviceroute.yaml\n使用体验总结\nKubeOrbit 工具主要有如下三种功能：在微服务测试环境内创建测试通道，这样就可以获得一个单独稳定的集成测试环境；把需要测试的微服务添加至测试通道中，将它们与其他不同版本的微服务隔离开来；在发起微服务请求的时候指定测试通道，KubeOrbit 会将其转发至你所指定的测试通道。这些功能刚好解决了我和团队耗时排队测试的困境，满足了团队测试的需求：\n1. 团队内部并行开发与联调测试的需求，大家无需再争抢使用测试环境\n2. 按时交付项目的需求，避免了因为测试环境不够导致项目延期的情况\n无需调整已有的技术栈和架构，KubeOrbit 会适配现有的微服务，还能够隔离不同测试通道之间的通讯。但是在产品的使用过程中，我发现还需要有较多的人工操作，增加了这个工具的使用门槛。如果能够把这些流程自动化，会给用户体验带来较大幅度的提升。刚好从公众号得知产品在 GitHub （ https://github.com/teamcode-inc/kubeorbit ）全部开源的消息，我也打算好好研究一下，持续关注这个项目和平台，希望未来有更好的体验。",

Now, however, as I'm pushing 70, my needs have changed. A few years ago, I purchased a brand new Darter Pro from System76, and its default resolution is 1920x1080, and it's high DPI, too. The system came with Pop_OS!, which I found that I had to modify to be able to see the icons and text on the display. Thank goodness that Linux on the desktop has become much more accessible than in the 1990s.\nread more",
