          "description": "The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.\nlet us look at an example\n\nlet person = {};\n\nperson.name = \"David\";\nperson.age = 45;\n\nperson.eat = function() {\nconsole.log(`person is eating`);\n}\n\nHere we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.\n\nWhen you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.\nSo the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.\nWhen a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:\nReturns undefined (if you tried to access a property).\nThrows an error (if you tried to call a method).",

          "description": "Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. \nOur mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future. Join our platform to learn more about what opportunities Interniac can offer you!\nPlease check out this OPENSOURCE project here and don’t forget to leave a star!\nhttps://www.github.com/interniac/Interniac-website",

To drive the point home: the US Department of Homeland Security is warning people about it.\nThere's been a lot of hand-wringing about how open source software, the lifeblood of many businesses today, is often totally unpaid and unthanked work, with some hot takes like 'Open source needs to grow the hell up.' and 'Open source' is broken.\nWhat I want to touch on is something that's been bothering me for the past few days, and solidified after seeing Bloomberg's piece–the fact that the log4j developers had this massive security issue dumped in their laps, with the expectation that they were supposed to fix it.

Data scientists need programming languages in order to have the necessary tools for their job. In this blog post, we will talk about the best programming languages for data science and why they are so important!\nR Language\nPython\nC++\nJava\nWolfram Language\nR, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.\nData science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code.

Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.\nHorizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples.

There are three storage modes: public-cloud — when infrastructure is hosted by third-party data centers, private-cloud — within the companies network, and hybrid — a mixed approach.\nThe popularity of SaaS has been growing for thirty years. It appeared within the 70-is because computers were huge and very expensive, and many companies couldn't afford to possess one.

People from discord recommended using XAMPP, so I'll be sticking with it for now. Having installed it, everything left is understanding how it works.",

In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!\nFor the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I've decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college's C language course notes. The issue I'm working on is about \"Standardize frontmatter across all pages\". When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.\nI've done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:\nAdded id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages\nEach property of frontmatter was unified in order\nUnified format of description\nShortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the <meta name=\"description\" content=\"...\"/> inside the <head>tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)\nAdded \"Standardize frontmatter\" to the CONTRIBUTING.md file\nPR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Getting reviews and change requests\n\n\nOne of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo's owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I'm familiar with the course notes, but I wasn't very good at C language.\nThe goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn't change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.",

You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. \nWhen you clone a Go project from github, for example, you'll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you're coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. \nYou may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn't have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project's go.mod file. \nFor example:\ngithub.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn't have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc.

          "description": "Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.\nA couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. \nThe specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh\n posted this:\nDev.to as a headless CMS\nVisakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read\n#react\n        #javascript\n        #webdev\n        #opensource\n      \nThis was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.\nYou've probably noticed several deprecations lately. It's all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.",

Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.\n\n\nIt facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. \n\n\nEasily switches between Versions of your code.\n\n\nEasily undo changes.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What is GitHub?🤔\n\n\nFirst, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.\nIt provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.\nGit is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.\nGit is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.\nGit is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.\nCan't be any simpler than that!!\nPlease make sure you leave a like 👍/loveheart ❤️ on this one.

Errors are unavoidable when writing code, which can be frustrating at times. \nvia GIPHY\nIn this article, I'll show you how to handle exceptions in Python.\nAn exception is an error that occurs while the program is running. In some cases, an exception may cause the program to stop or produce unexpected results. For example, taking a look at Fig 1.0. This program gets two numbers from the user and divides the first number by the second number, and displays the result. However, when the program is run, an exception occurs as shown in Fig 1.1.\n\nFig 1.0\n\n\n\nFig 1.1\n\n\nThe error message displayed in Fig 1.1 is called a traceback.

          "description": "CircleCI is not the most popular CI/CD platform for open source contributors today, but it is widely used by many big sharks in the industry. So we have to keep in mind how to accurately configure it. \nCircleCI offers several execution environments. Those bold nerds from San Francisco call them executors. An executor defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job. Set up your jobs to run in the docker, machine, macos or windows executor and specify an image with the tools and packages you need.\n\nAlso, CircleCI provide using so-called orbs with its platform. Orbs are open-source, shareable packages of parametrizable reusable configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. You may involve orbs to reduce configuration complexity and help you integrate …",

This is done by a series of commands, such as this:\nforward 5\ndown 5\nforward 8\nup 3\ndown 8\nforward 2\n\nWe have a command, followed by a number - one pair per line. There are three commands:\nforward moves the submarine horizontally by number\n\n\ndown moves it down, increasing the depth we're at\nup does exactly the opposite of down\n\n\n\nA series of commands - that's a program! To execute it, we need basically 3 things: a lexer, a parser and an interpreter. Fortunately, Elixir gives us…",

I love that you can add attendees and other properties. But the tablet app is painful to use with a stylus. And because it's so structured, I'm less likely to add notes that don't fit in a predefined section.\nSamsung Notes. For daily tasks and reminders. This replaced the Cambridge Quad notebooks I used to buy in bulk. I bought a Samsung tablet, and now I'm stuck. The handwriting recognition is the best of multiple apps I've tried. Unfortunately the people at Samsung make it impossible to access and edit your notes on desktop or the web.\nOneNote. Which I've been trying to use because it's there and easy to save random screenshots to. But the lack of basic editing features and plugins sucks. The forced notebook and page structure is also pretty limiting. I hate clicking around to find notes and the view easily feels cluttered.\nRandom sticky notes. For random thoughts, customer service case numbers, git commands to refer back to, etc.\nI would love to use one app that does everything these 4 apps do:\nOrganize my notes into groups and structures that I can easily search and get back to\nBe workable on tablet. I'm not asking for much here. Just let me take notes. Recognize my handwriting and let me edit on desktop or the web.\nSimple interface that doesn't inhibit random notes or reminders I want to jot down.\nSomeone suggested Obsidian. Never used it before, but would love to get some feedback from those who have. If there's another app that you swear, please let me know!\nPhoto by Polina Tankilevitch from Pexels",

The application class can’t predict the sub-class to instantiate as the choice might depend on numerous factors, such as the state of the application at run-time or its configuration.\nThe Factory method pattern solves this problem by encapsulating the functionality of selecting and instantiating the appropriate class inside a designated method, which we refer to as the factory method.\nThe factory method pattern can be used in cases where:\nA class can not know or predict the object it must create\nA class wants t…",

The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I've watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.\nI'm not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn't really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.\nSo my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?",

Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content.

It’s the front door of DEV.to.\nWe wanted to gather information about the impact of changing the front door. At Forem we use the Field Test gem. This allows us to run different experiments. I configured Field Test to assign 20% of the folks to the new strategy and 80% of the folks to the prior strategy.\nTo insulate from upstream libraries, we often wrap those libraries in our own implementations. This helps with the principle of least exposure; rely on the narrowest interface possible. I wrote the AbExperiment class to be the wrapper around Field Test.

Truth be told, there are several issues that can spring up from an unorganized, unprincipled global state.\nAs a basic example, the global state may contain a response payload from an API request, and it may contain some UI state about whether certain components are visible. These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.\nWhen these distinctions aren't made, you can run into trouble. For example, if you create a top-level property for every screen/experience, you can duplicate the storage of the API responses that support those experiences:\nconst s…",

This article covers what is Linear Regression, how it works, the maths behind the normal equation method, fixing some edge cases, handling overfitting and code implementation.\nLinear Regression in simple terms is fitting the best possible linear hypothesis (a line or a hyperplane) on the data having a linear relationship so that we can predict the new unknown data point with the least possible error. It's not necessary to have a linear relationship in data but having such can lead to approximately close predictions. For a reference take a look at the below representation.\n\nIn the above picture, only 1 feature (along…",

          "description": "If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.\nDisplaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.\nIn this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.\nThe procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.\nThe first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.\nWhen you move it, you can paste this code for the script:\nGIT=`xcrun -find git`\nGIT_REV=`${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD`\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}\" \"${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}\"\n\nIn the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.\nNow, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.\nTo display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:\nlet revision = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: \"REVISION\") as? String \n\nIn Objective-C we would do it like this:\nNSString *revision = [NSBundle.mainBundle objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@\"REVISION\"];",

This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.\nVanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.\nJS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.\nJavaScript can be used for the following:\n Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.\n Creating web and mobile applications.\n Building web servers and developing server applications.\n Game Development\nTypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.\n TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.\n TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.\n JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.\n TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn't need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.\n\nThe benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:\n Supports Class and Modules.\n Static Type-checking\n ES6 Feature Support\n Clear Library API definition.\n Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.\n Superset of JavaScript\n\nAs TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.",

          "description": "For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.\nAvailable in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:\nconst { randomUUID } = require(\"crypto\");\nrandomUUID(); // \"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\nIt's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!\nYou can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.",

But learning AWS is made more challenging when you're also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. \nIn simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. \nStacks can be stood up manually. However, it's better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…",

I have too, and that's why on more than one occasion I've wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.\nOkay! to start with this:\nHTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it \"programming language\" should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a \"markup language\" because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.\nAs I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :\n<tag>content</tag>\n\nHowever this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :\n<img>\n\nBut that's not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like \"upgrades\" of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.\n<tag attribute=\"value\">content</tag>.\n\nIt seems interesting, doesn't it?

          "description": "Let me describe my coding journey to build a Social Proof component from Frontend Mentors. Frontend Mentors is a online platform that provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs.\nThe goal is to build this:\n\nThe first coding hurdle was setting up the HTML & CSS to create the initial layout and then testing if it flowed decently between mobile and desktop as intended. \nMy first decision was deciding between CSS Grid, Flexbox, or a combination of the two. Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool\nMy tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas. \nGIF of responsive layout\n\nScreen-shot of the Layout\n\nThe next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.\nScreen shot of app in development, no styling\n\nNow for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. \nThe one thing I didn't know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time. \nScreenshot of CSS code for setting multiple background images\n\n\nYou can play with the solution here\nI learned how to add multiple background images at one time. \nI was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: \nDesign a responsive layout\nBuild a foundation with HTML\nAdd content\nStyle with CSS, section by section\nEnd with functionality (JavaScript & CSS animation/transitions)\nThis \"Ground up\" methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra \"Slow is Fast\".   \nTips on Background Images  by CSS Tricks\nThank you for reading my blog. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nYou can find the completed code here",

          "description": "Mensah Alkebu-Lan\nPrerequisites\nDiscussion\nReferences\nSome familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.\nArrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.\nThe Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.\nBelow is a typical example of how the filter function is used:\nvar arr1 = [1,2,3,4],\n    arr2 = [2,4],\n    res = arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item));\n\nconsole.log(res);\n\nWhen this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array. \n Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter.

After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.\nA quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties' blogs about anything open-source. \nFor my task, I had to customize Telescope's build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:\nAdd header and side navigation bar\nChange side navigation default logo into Telescope logo\nUpdate link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Working on the issue\n\n\nAfter setting up the development environment using Telescope's documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.\nI began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn't break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. \nSince I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn't break or miss anything.\nSimilar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.\nCheers! 🍻",

Without financial stability and growth, the company is at risk of coming to a halt, which affects its employees and customers. The goal of a business is to stay in business. Perhaps, you understand that, and you see that open sourcing a project will help the company thrive more, but you're unsure how to help your employer recognize the value in open sourcing a project.\nHere are four concerns your boss may have and responses you can use to alleviate their worries:\nYour response: Licensing is confusing, but we don't have…",

Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.\nAt the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.\nI will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.\nI also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week's worth of changes. \nA little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I'm not too upset about it. \nA clean slate, a new approach!\nI am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it's really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. \nComplicated state management between components.

          "description": "Occasionally you might want to rename an AWS S3 bucket you are managing with Terraform. However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.\nTo avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.\nIn this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:\nresource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {\n    bucket = “old-name”\n}\n\nand you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.\nFirstly, we’ll need to create a new bucket.

A helpful CSS reset built on top of modern-normalize.\nMargins, headings, lists, and many others get stripped from their defaults. Thus, achieving cross-browser consistency and an easier adaptation of your design system.\nIt all sounds helpful, until you need those defaults to style a markdown post.\nIn comes @tailwindcss/typography, a plugin with sensible typographic styles. It adds a set of prose classes to style content blocks like the one you are reading.\nYou can install it via npm or yarn:\n# Using npm\nnpm install @tailwindcss/typography\n\n# Using Yarn\nyarn add @tailwindcss/typography\n\nThen add the plugin to your tailwind.config.js file:\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\n    // ...\n  ],\n}\n\nFinally, you can use the prose class to apply the markdown styling:\n<article class=\"prose lg:prose-xl\">\n  <h1>Welcome to Mars!</h1>\n  <p>\n    Although life on Mars is perfect in every single way, you might have some questions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Of course there’s air!

Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: \nIntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)\n\nTooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image)\n\nRight-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) \nYAML Syntax Validation \nHyperlinks for Docker Images \nIn our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!\nThere are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:\nMore tab completions\nDocker Compose schema validation \n… and much more! \nWe love your feedback!

          "description": "互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。\n下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。\n\n一、历史回顾\nWeb 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。\n\nWeb 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。\n\n二、Web3 的特征\nWeb3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。\n\n我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。\nWeb 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。\n娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。\n在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。\n三、虚拟世界\n所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。\n到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。\n四、Web3 是分布式的\n这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！\n这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：\n（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；\n（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。\n五、区块链的作用\n如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。\n这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。\n一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。\n另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。\n六、数字资产\n区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。\n如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。\n\n举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。\n我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。\n我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。\n创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说：\"Web3 就是所有权\"，就是这个意思。\n\n如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。\n目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。\n（完）\n文档信息\n版权声明：自由转载-非商用-非衍生-保持署名（创意共享3.0许可证）\n发表日期： 2021年12月 7日",

          "description": "最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。\n\n与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。\n\n虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。\n\n\n\n游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。\n\n\n\n《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。\n最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。\n说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。\n\n虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n呆罗\n点击下载\n22 个回答，查看全部。\n纸糊的药丸是怎么生产的？\n《纸嫁衣 2 奘铃村》讲的是一个什么样的故事？",

          "description": "一证虽小，意义非凡！！\n自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。\n因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。\n退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： \n一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇\n当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。\n退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。\n\n在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。\n但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。\n\n二、光荣的象征\n 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。\n 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。\n对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。\n三、身份的证明\n 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。\n 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。\n 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。\n四、全国通用\n近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。\n而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。\n不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 \n退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。\n\n而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n三剑客\n点击下载\n8 个回答，查看全部。\n我国军人的战斗意志是不是世界最强的？\n军人不能上传照片吗？",

          "description": "大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。\n非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。\n我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。\n首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。\n\n\n\n其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~\n\n厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。\n\n对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。\n最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nNeena\n点击下载\n49 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》第108集？\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》播放量破百亿？",

          "description": "每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。\n当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。\n总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……\n\n作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。\n从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。\n\n大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。\n锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。\n\n然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。\n早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？\n据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。\n\n其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。\n以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。\n\n在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nKay King\n点击下载",

          "description": "简单谈一谈个人的看法。\n电影里的励志、鸡汤，其本身都不是原罪。重要的是，作品的励志与鸡汤是否真正地站在真实性的基础之上。只有客观而忠实地反映了真实，作品才有了励志与鸡汤的基本说服力。\n《雄狮少年》，不是完全彻底的励志向作品，而它给出的真实反映水平，也是“不完全”的：拥有了对真实表象的呈现，却未能走到表象之下。理想与现实，传统文化与当代社会，精神信仰与物质压力，一系列的冲突，也就此停留在了“足够客观的表象展现”程度上。表象客观全面，已经在同类、国产作品里颇为少有，可称“不错”；而缺乏深度细化，则阻碍了它向更优秀之处的攀登脚步，必须报以一声“遗憾”。\n\n这部作品的第一组镜头，便强化了自身的现实属性。在旁白的介绍里，舞狮是中国传统文化的象征存在，代表着曾经时代的光辉。然而，随着一句“主角却不是他”，就将现实的时代做了切换——一个长镜头跟随着骑车的男主角，扫过了破落的农村街景，以及衣衫褴褛的民众，让当代社会的时态呈现出来。曾经以舞狮为骄傲的传统时光已经不复存在，取而代之的，是在物质压力下被迫的生存之道，经济落后地区的家庭为了赚钱，家长只能背井离乡，去大城市打工，而诞生无数的留守家庭。\n包括此时出现的主角形象，都在强调着现实的因素。他不是动漫主角常有的大眼美男，而是生活里比较普遍的单眼皮少年，其后，这种形象也延伸到了女主角扁塌的鼻梁上。这样的形象，让人物彻底回归了现实感最强的“普通”之中——他没有任何突出的地方，外形都如此平庸，也就不具备所谓的“被选中之子”之类的潜藏天赋。\n而主角随后的遭遇，更是让这个信息有了更明确的落地。心怀舞狮憧憬的他，被称为病猫。而抢走他红包的舞狮队成员，一方面体现着舞狮这样的传统文化于物质化当代的变质，同时也反过来说明了舞狮衰落的原因——忙于赚钱的人们，不再对舞狮这样的东西抱有兴趣，这便让历史悠久的陈家村舞狮队，也丧失了自己本应具有的骄傲，物质功利了起来，以…",

          "description": "我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。\n我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。\n为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。\n翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：\n随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug\n还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：\n可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动\n这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。\n展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：\n这个项目放弃前的一段录屏\n我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。\n所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n李喆\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n在使用unity独立开发游戏时，你认为实现最麻烦的是哪个系统？\n用unity开发一款游戏需要学习多少软件？",

          "description": "不知不觉在游戏开发行业已过十年，从刚入行的技术小白，到现在依然什么都不懂的技术搬砖工，见证了一个时代的游戏技术变革。我本人先后做过游戏开发SDK，端游MMO，休闲手游，重度手游，大世界手游，大世界端游等各品类产品，现在是天美F1工作室技术中台引擎程序团队负责人。\n游戏行业发展很快，玩家对游戏的要求越来越高，游戏对技术的要求也越来越高，开发量也越来越大。我现在所在的天美F1工作室正在开发3A级全平台的大世界游戏，这是一件非常具有挑战的事情。\n本人作为游戏引擎程序，深知技术更新之快，需要不断的学习才能接受这个挑战。所幸我们已经提前在多个方向积累了对标国际3A大厂的技术能力，并且还在全球招募了不少具有3A项目研发背景的各方面人才。通过不断的夯实技术基础，我们有能力也有信心接受新的挑战。在我们储备的技术中，PCG的技术是目前大世界游戏必不可少的一种技术，现在做一些简单介绍。\nPCG（Procedural content generation过程化内容生成）技术是最近比较热的提升游戏生产效率的一类技术。它是什么意思呢？\n网络百科给出的答案：过程生成（英语：procedural generation）是计算机科学中一种使计算机自动制造一类数据的算法。在计算机图形学中，它也被称为随机生成，常用于制作材质贴图和三维模型资源，并在电子游戏领域中用于自动制造大量游戏内容。过程化生成有着减小文件体积、扩大内容量、增强游戏随机性等优点。\n我个人的理解：如果在游戏中应用，简单说，过程化内容生成就是利用算法来自动生成游戏内容。原有的游戏内容需要美术和策划花费大量的精力制作，过程化的方式可以大大降低人工成本，除了可以节省一些重复的人工劳动之外，甚至可以自动创作出一些新的设计内容。试想如果有一个程序可以自动生产游戏，那是多么有意思的一件事情，也许那天到来，游戏开发者都下岗了。\n地形是大世界的基础，大世界没…",

          "description": "作为社恐人士，看看我这小眼神就知道我是自愿回答的！\n\n\n因为直到开播前都很兴奋，所以前几天都没怎么睡，思维到现在都还有点乱，就随便闲聊下吧。\n\n\n我们跟腾讯动漫算是合作很久了，他们在我们大火鸟还没什么名气的时候就给了很多机会，加上这次能得到《大王饶命》这个项目，真的很感激也很开心。\n\n\n我还记得当初ASK老师和我第一次说这个项目的时候，我就觉得这是我们团队的荣耀，而且碰巧ASK老师和肘子老师还有我三个都是白羊座,生日还刚好挨着，就觉得这缘分也太巧了。\n\n\n说来有点不好意思，在还没见到本人前，我以为肘子老师是那种特别严肃的老人家，没想到碰面后反而有种一见如故的感觉。于是我就追着他问了很多关于小说创作的事，一番交流下来，我算是深刻地领会到了什么叫头部作者。\n\n\n光是我们这几个小时的聊天就足够让我学到了很多平时压根不可能注意的故事创作细节，而且他最厉害的就是可以在极短的时间里想到一段非常有意思的梗，大王第一话开头的吕树怼糖葫芦师傅就是肘子老师几分钟内蹦出来的创意，真的是让人非常佩服。\n\n\n话说回来，虽说能接到这个项目很让人兴奋，但兴奋劲过头随之而来的就是不安了。因为这部小说的知名度很高，加上肘子老师对我们的期待很高，所以我们必须拿出全部实力去完成它才行。\n\n\n最终在燃尽了全部精力后，作品顺利上线了，从那刻起，我心里的不安也就渐渐消散了，真心希望大家能够喜欢上《大王饶命》的动画版。\n\n\n说起动画版的亮点，这两天被大家热议的OP肯定是一个重头戏。实话实说，其实我并没有刻意去做什么布局之类的、与创作无关的事。我只是给了一群爱玩的朋友一个足够的空间，让大家可以在其中尽情玩耍，玩得开心。\n\n\n我确实没想到会火到这个程度，毕竟我每次做OP/ED的初衷就是让创作者尽情表达自己的创作欲，我相信只有完全释放激情和灵感的作品才是好作品。这也是我为什么特别喜欢跟无念聊创作的事，因为每当我跟他聊起OP时，我能够感受到他眼里是有光的，这是他真心喜欢做的东西，就像他说在制作过程里并没有遇到什么太大的难题，反而更像是水到渠成。\n\n\n至于正片内容，对我来说比较难的是如何让吕树的怼人场景比较贴合我们的现实世界，因为如果过度追求搞笑效果的话，很容易就会变成那种烂大街的搞笑喜剧。然而这部作品的内核并不是搞笑，所以我们最初开始制作的时候就定下了偏写实的方向，只有这样才能让吕树这个角色显得更加立体。在初期讨论时尤其让我最印象深刻的是ASK老师说“麻烦导演你把第一季做的穷一些，要那种从里到外的穷感。”\n\n\n真是让人头大.jpg。\n\n\n一部好剧肯定少不了好细节，我们现在每次要制作新作时，在正式开始前都会去相关地点进行场景、道具的取材，《大王饶命》也不例外，这次为了构建出吕树的房子，我们收集了相当多的资料，所以最后出来的场景美术设定所有人看了都很满意。比较可惜的是我们没能赶上庙会的时间，所以没能体会到原汁原味的庙会氛围，有点可惜。\n\n\n除了吕树的房子外，像是比较重要的学校场景也在精心收集了很多资料后对它进行了高度的还原，尤其是道元班的设计，我是真的苦恼了很久，最终才定下了方案。而且因为疫情的缘故，在取材结束后我们就匆匆回到了广州，在那之后因为各种原因也没能再去一次，所以后面的很多场景就只能参考之前拍的照片，通过回忆和讨论尽可能地还原了。\n\n\n最后，再次感谢腾讯动漫，谢谢肘子老师，给了我们这次参与《大王饶命》动画化项目的机会！\n\n\n\n危天行\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价7doc七创社的新作品《凹凸世界》？\n如何评价《镜双城》正式动画化？",

          "description": "很多年前我在知乎给过一个论述，今天再稍微做一次复读机：\n工业水平决定爆款上限\n受众特质决定爆款呈现\n囿于写这个论述的时候，我对于游戏产业的工业化其实理解是有一定偏差的。所以今天我对这个论述稍微修正一下：\n在创意行业中，工业水准决定表达形态。\n当然还是要说明，我自己并非游戏开发，本职工作现在更接近发行；很多涉及开发本身的事情我的回答会显得班门弄斧，请大家多多指正。\n-\n如何定义工业化？\n我的定义就是在项目上建立高效的自动化系统，拥有成熟的开发技术栈，优化的开发工具，并利用成熟的系统高效地生产游戏内容。\n工业化其实更多是生产方式的区别，重点在于效率的提升，而并非是产出的游戏本身的大区别。——在这个意义上来说，某些大作其实并非工业化生产，或者最多是纺织工人用上了珍妮纺织机，但离真正意义上的工业化生产，还有很多距离。\n回归到问题“如何看待工业化对游戏产业发展的重要意义？“本身，在这个回答中，我想谈三个事情。\n其一，是产能的提升。\n产能其实是两个维度，第一是能做什么，第二是同样的时间能做多少。\n实际上是存在一个反-工业化的叙事的。那就是“小作坊”生产。而大家都在鼓吹工业化生产，或者至少认为工业化生产是一个好东西的时候，我们面临的现状是大多数的游戏开发都以小作坊式生产为主。\n这个倒不是说大家条件艰苦云云，而是说开发模式还是以堆人力，怼资源的模式为主。\n在这种情况下，决定产品上下限的，都是团队整体每一个人的能力。在这种情况下来说，人员的稳定性和能力水平就非常致命。\n同时，团队能力的下限也在非常大的程度上决定了你能做什么样的东西。\n而开发的工业化在一定程度上是能够解决这个问题的，成熟的开发管线可以让内容的生产效率更高，也让内容生产更不依赖于某个/些特定人才。\n这点在于游戏产品质量需求提升明显的今天，是尤其重要的：尽快完成开发工业化的厂商/工作室，一方面能够更快的追随市场的喜好，生产表现力更强的游戏产品；另一方面则显然能够有更大的腾挪空间，对市场的适应性更高。\n其二，是管理模式的改变。\n工业化的生产，势必引领更工业化的管理模式。这点在逻辑上还是很明显的。产能提升其实能够显著避免micro-management。项目管理的重要性也越来越多。\n倒不是说某一种或者某几种项目管理模式就一定行。但以往关键角色一言堂的情况，在更高的产能下，其实会有一定的衰减——因为在高产能的环境下，leverage资源比对项目直接bb要更紧迫。\n囿于我本身并非管理者，所以我对于这点的诠释并不全面。但我能够清楚且欣喜地看到，工业化能够带来的是更先进，也更能发挥每个人能力的管理模式。\n其三，则是成本以及行业场景的远期变化。\n有群友回答说，未来的游戏行业会有明显的两极分化现象。这点我非常同意——但是原因跟工业化的生产方式其实关系不大。更多的原因在于需求的变化：即使是在F2P领域，玩家亦需要表现力更佳的“大”游戏。\n诚然，对于多数厂商来说，将自己舒适区内的开发模式更替为更工业化的开发模式，确实会有段时间的成本上升以及转型的阵痛。但长期来看，工业化的产能是能够在一定程度上降低成本的。\n君不见EA，Ubi等等海外开发商，即使在海外他们的人力成本已经跟国内持平甚至更低了。但单纯从开发能力来看，国内还没有哪家公司敢说他们比海外厂商强的。\n更近一步讲。即使对于个人/独立开发者来说，工业化体系下催生的产品，也会对他们的开发提供便利——君不见，Unity的普及让我们其实前所未有地容易开始做游戏了（当然真不真的去做又是另一回事）。\n这最终导致的是游戏开发的商业电影-艺术电影分化，不肯找到自己真实地位的厂家被大浪淘沙。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知乎用户（登录查看详情）\n点击下载\n17 个回答，查看全部。\n原神2.0版本稻妻版本，能否说明米哈游原神制作组已经完成团队磨合，进入游戏工业化高产能状态?\n你为什么会觉得做独立游戏和做工业化游戏差不多呢?",

          "description": "感谢邀请。确实，从目前趋势看，国内各大游戏厂商和工作室都陆续在海外布局，在海外设立自研工作室并大力引进海外高端人才。海外工作室的建立，可以一定程度上进行产能扩容，减轻游戏内容的研发压力。\n更重要的是，海外一线专家的加入，可以带来老牌游戏开发商在高品质内容生产上的方案和经验，对于快速完成生产管线改造和核心研发能力升级上有比较大的参考意义。对于国内游戏厂商来说，加入全球化研发无疑是加速团队成长与探索AAA生产模式的机遇。\n但挑战总是与机遇并存，全球化研发的趋势对游戏研发团队和个人，都会带来更多新的要求。不论是国内的游戏工作室，还是海外游戏厂商，目标都是建立“快速量产AAA品质游戏内容”的能力。只是各自的原始积累不一样，努力的方向也不尽相同。\n对于我们来说，想在游戏研发全球化的大趋下守住优势并脱颖而出，不论在技术与工具的积累和探索上，还是在生产模式的摸索和迭代上，都应该以兼容并包的心态，吸收国内外的先进经验，快速建立自己的产研优势。\n我们工作室在技术革新和前沿探索上一直比较积极，我自己也经历过数次大规模的技术升级和管线改造，目前也在负责新项目的技术迭代的规划和落地，可以分享一下我们在这个过程中的想法和经验，希望能提供给大家作个参考。\n准备一：搭建工业化管线 — 流程标准化与生产自动化\n随着玩家对高品质游戏内容量的需求增长，未来精品游戏项目的研发必然需要超大规模团队的承载和支撑，也呈现着跨地区多团队配合的趋势。这也正是全球化研发的本质。\n跟单一团队生产不一样，跨地区多团队的联合研发，对于生产流程标准化的要求会非常高，以避免低效沟通带来生产成本的极大代价。\n海外厂商在多地团队联合研发上有其经验和优势，值得我们借鉴和学习。 同时在游戏内容生产方面，自动化生成代替纯人工生产也将成为大趋势，通过程序化的方式可以大幅减少在内容生产上的人力成本，并提高整个项目的研发效率，以适应市场的快速变化。…",

          "description": "我是在传统老牌的西方 AAA 公司工作 15 年后加入中国游戏研发工作室的，我结合自己的观察和体验，尝试回答这个问题。\n近几年，中国的游戏公司有很大的变化，逐渐向重视原创、追求更高品质、打造具有中国文化特色的游戏产品转变。最近经常听到这样一句话“中国游戏玩家的口味越来越高，国内的游戏公司也开始卷起来了。”\n“卷”这个词用在这样的语境下，我认为不是件坏事，它代表着随着市场需求的变化，中国的游戏厂商对于品质的重视程度变得越来越高。\n国外的 AAA 厂商已经这样“卷”了十几年了：游戏的画面越来越接近影视化，内容丰富度和体量越来越高，争相进行技术上的探索和突破，同时创新的作品也层出不穷。我很高兴看到中国的游戏公司也以这样的方式“卷”起来，让中国的游戏产品在各个维度上与国外的 AAA 大作掰一掰手腕。\n\n我相信这样的转变，对于许多海内外从事 AAA 游戏开发的人才选择加入中国游戏公司，是一个至关重要的前提。 \nAAA 游戏的开发是一个先慢后快的过程。一个非常有经验的 AAA 游戏团队，也可能要花费 1-2 年的时间来完成概念和创意方面的探索，2-3 年左右的时间进行试生产（Pre-production），这里主要包括设计方面的验证和技术管线的搭建。\n所以，经常会出现游戏开发了 4、5 年，看起来却只有一个垂直切片以及一大堆白盒和临时资源的情况。但接下来会是神奇的一段时间，通常 80% 的游戏内容，都是在最后的 1 年到 1 年半时间里完成的。\n这种“神奇”有一个前提条件，就是整个团队可以沉下心来，完成前面提到的创意设计和试生产环节，否则最后的全面投产（Full-production）将会是一场灾难。\n每一部 AAA 游戏的开发都是一趟漫长的旅程，耐心，信心和决心三样缺一不可。而我已经在国内的游戏厂商中看到了这三样东西，所以我回来了。\n从 EA 到天美\n我在 2006 年加入 EA 上…",

          "description": "其实把“野外露营”和“精致露营”作为对比选项，就像把“西餐”和“水果”拿来对比一样，在概念的内涵和外延上，怎么说都有点“差辈”。\n\n\n基本上，露营可以分为三种：\n\n\n第一种，Bushcraft露营，更倾向于荒野求生。\nBush是澳大利亚对森林的称呼，Craft则是技能的意思。所以Bushcraft也就是那种住山洞，或者拿树枝搭个窝棚，最不济带一块油布搭个避难所的露营。\n\n这是回归原始生活的一种露营，什么现代化工具都没有，什么钻木取火了，什么用树皮做绳索了，什么拿木头挖陷坑了，玩就玩最野的，没有足够的知识、经验、体魄、意志，是做不到的：\n赤身裸体户外露营，夜晚如何取暖御寒_哔哩哔哩_bilibili\n\n当然，在国内，怎么钻木取火荒野求生，那都是动嘴的，实际上绝大部分Bushcraft爱好者连公园都没睡过，真动手的都是买买买，什么2000块钱的英国手工斧子，什么1500块钱的美国煤油灯，什么3000块钱的瑞典柴火炉。没钱的就买什么战术鱼钩、钛合金火柴盒啥的，逐渐沦为COSPLAY艺术、手工艺品收藏，和YY了。\n\n这其实不是Bushcraft露营，而是Bushcraft风格露营，也就是牛奶和牛奶风味饮料的区别了。\n\n\n另外从环保的角度说，古人这么露营是没办法，从现代露营的角度来说，明明是从大都市开着越野车进林子，明明有20块钱、200多克一个，一个能用两天的气罐不带，非要带好几斤重的斧子去乱砍树木，破坏环境，就为了烧起一堆柴火感觉很炫酷，我个人是对此相当持保留意见的。\n\n\n\n无痕山林的准则，不说全都对，但既然你要去露营，最好还是要了解一下：\n1.事前充分的规划与准备，\n2.在可承受地点行走宿营，\n3.适当处理垃圾维护环境，\n4.保持环境原有的风貌，\n5.减低用火对环境的冲击，\n6.尊重野生动植物，\n7.考虑其他的使用者。\n\n\n\n\n\n第二种，经典露营/常规露营。\n也就是最为我们熟知…",

          "description": "『车田漫画里需要的不是起承转合，如何让读者感到惊讶才是最重要的』\n———by 车田正美\n\n\n\n这是整个车田宇宙的核心，也是圣斗士成为经典的核心。\n\n\n也许当年就真吃这套，天马行空的设定比故事本身更受关注。车田这么做了，也确确实实的做到了，打造了一个跨世纪的经典。\n\n\n车田以他自己那套独创的模式开拓了一片新天地。「开头→叙述→转折→结尾」这种死板的形式，在车田宇宙里可不太常见。\n\n\n各种荒诞无稽的设定，夸张的必杀，独特的战斗表现集合成所谓的『车田節』。凭借这些独特之处，堆砌了圣斗士世界。\n\n\n\n▽\n当然，光有核没有精美外壳想必也无法做到风靡世界。其中，星座的实体化无疑是圣斗士成为经典的最重要因素。\n\n\n在生活中，星座早已成为如同十二生肖般的必然存在。当时，多少朋友通过圣斗士把十二星座倒背如流。\n\n\n星座通过防具【圣衣】得到实体化。再配上美型男与其搭配，这是男女通杀的妙招，无一幸免。\n\n\n圣衣的定位本身也是一个亮点，它增大了星座实体化的魅力！\n\n\n\n『最初打算用日本武士铠甲型防具，战斗模式就像空手道对决那样。威力过于强大，所以需要穿戴防具。\n\n\n但感觉普通的防具太土。烦恼之际，脑中突然浮现出希腊神话，觉得把防具做成星座的形状那绝对很酷。\n\n\n防具定位于西洋风那种带曲线的设计。现在看来狮子座艾欧里亚的黄金圣衣，应该是最接近当初所构思的印象吧』\n\n\n\n圣衣效仿西洋风甲胄，但未照搬样式。反倒是削弱了笨重感，进行了更贴身的改良，就像穿戴的服装一样。\n\n\n动画版中的圣衣设计，更是改良得凸显了美型男的完美身体曲线。这样的视觉冲击，也是促进人气暴涨的重要因素吧。\n其中，荒木伸吾与姫野美智的功劳甚大\n\n\n圣衣根据等级还体现着不同的风格。而这种等级差异，车田直接用对身体的覆盖率，进行了体现。\n\n\n\n『当初对圣斗士有个大概的年龄设定。青铜为初中，白银为高中，黄金为大学。对应身高约在165，175，180左右。\n\n\n另外，圣衣的等级如同军队里的官阶。青铜为尉级，白银为校级，黄金则是将级。\n\n\n一般印象中，低等兵大都穿戴像作业服那种比较短款的服装，长官级是夹克之类的，而将领级则是长款大衣那种吧。\n\n\n如此，仅凭穿着就可能判断出级别。当时就是这样考虑的』\n\n\n圣斗士中青铜最低级，看着也最凉快。白银稍微严实点，黄金则露出更少，神圣衣基本就约等于全身覆盖了。\n\n\n\n虽然是防具，但圣衣更像是一种时尚。圣衣的命名『cloth』也算是回应了此特征。\n\n\n似衣非衣，即使不穿戴圣衣，它依靠着星座本来的造型依然能独立炫酷的存在。这样的设计超级有魅力，即便现在也依旧拉风。\n\n\n▽\n如此独特的设定，没有足够大的空间，想必也难以展现出它全部的魅力。\n\n\n圣斗士宏大的世界观，就为圣衣提供了一个完现魅力的『时尚平台』。圣衣在无形中仿佛拉近了传说与现实的距离。\n\n\n\n车田用一个『超』字把众多神话串联起，所有神话被归纳成同宗。各家神话在圣斗士世界里就相当于从宗家衍生出的支派。\n\n\n但在未普及互联网，信息较闭塞的当时也很难能了解到这部分内容。\n\n\n而圣斗士的历史背景，其尺度远比当时所理解的要大得多得多，被称之为『大圣战史』。\n\n\n》宇宙的诞生\n》生命的诞生\n》雅典娜的诞生\n》波塞冬的初次圣战，圣斗士与圣衣诞生\n》巨人族之战\n》阿瑞斯的圣战\n》and so on………\n\n\n在正篇开始之前，还有这么一大段迷一般的历史存在。这一切在作品中基本都未提及，而是记载于此刊物中。\n\n\n\n当了解到这一大段历史后，有种圣斗士的尺度又被放大了一倍的感觉。就是在这样一个大世界里，光芒万丈的圣衣照亮着每个角落。\n《圣斗士星矢》中的众神体系是怎么样的？\n\n▽\n比起圣斗士的世界观，它的故事则显得要简单得多。但依靠这来自独特灵感的设计，依旧让此作如凤凰烈火般火红。\n\n\n因为车田一直致力于让观众感受到震撼！\n\n\n他破天荒的才能，对当时的观众来说也许是恰到好处。仿佛是艾欧洛斯附身，用暗影之箭束缚了世界各地观众的心。\n\n\n时代在变，那份情怀却难以忘怀。那句口号依旧响彻云霄，被喊出了跨世纪的经典：\n\n\n燃えろ、俺のコスモよ！\n\n\n\n\n^参考\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n千翻儿娃\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n《圣斗士星矢》的顺序是怎样的？\n如何评价《圣斗士星矢》中五小强之一的瞬？",

          "description": "答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。\n首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。\n再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。\n其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。\n比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。\n\n例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。\n举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……\n说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。\n\n普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。\n当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   \n那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？\n\n答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。\n\n如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国汽研指数专家\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n请问，哪个品牌的汽车，方向盘助力做的较好，能不能比较一下？（方向盘比较轻柔，不用费太大力气。）？\n为什么大部分汽车的方向盘不在中间？",

          "description": "汽车安全座椅在小朋友的眼中，也许是这样的：\n\n其实在1940年前后，一小部分有车家庭就开始使用了。但如果我跟你说，当时的画风是这样的，你还敢坐嘛？\n\n是的，那个时候它的长相和功能和现在相距甚远。严格来说还称不上是一个“安全座椅”，最多算是“汽车座椅”。\n\n如果回到那个时代生活，我宁愿孩子们都不要坐它！因为那个时候的汽车座椅并非现在的「免死金牌」，而是一个不折不扣、骇人听闻的「儿童杀手」。\n下面我就用多图来带大家看看，儿童汽车安全座椅有着怎样令人深感震撼的的百年曲折发展史。\n❤️ 阶段一：座椅？打包带！\n1. 啼笑皆非的早期原型\n上世纪30年代能开上车的，那可真不是一般人，人们普遍认为，巨大坚硬、风雨无阻的汽车本身就是最厉害的。\n当时的克莱斯勒汽车广告上俨然写着： \n “亲爱的爸爸，你看我在100公里每小时（60迈/小时）的车上还能写字哎。” \n“是的儿子，我们现在乘坐的就是无坚不摧的钢铁大桥号。”\n而且无论大人小孩，一律没有安全保护措施。\n\n这在今天就是典型的反面教材，但那时候人们的交通安全意识基本为零。当时的汽车就算有任何安全设施，也完全不是从乘客的健全和舒适角度出发，而是为了驾驶者的方便。\n比如，Bunny Bear公司在1933年发明的第一台儿童汽车座椅，只需要用绑绳捆在座位上。娃坐的高了、看得远了，注意力被转移了。大人开车也就不容易被打扰了。\n\n到了40-60年代，家长可以花1-5刀买一个更加便携轻便的可折叠座椅。\n它通常是像下面这样，用铁架子加帆布、麻布、塑料板或木箱做成的。靠两个铁钩子挂在座位靠背上，酷似一个“带钩子的内裤”。\n\n单看乘坐的部分有点像如今的跳跳椅。不过从结构上更像一个吹风机挂篮的放大版。随意程度简直令人怀疑历史。\n\n还有的人为了进一步增加娱乐效果，让孩子站在车座上模仿大人开车。\n我们大概不需要通过撞击模拟实验也可以猜出，当意外发生时，这种挂钩座椅…",

          "description": "大家好，我是沈乐平导演。今天我们《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》正式上线了，今天正好是感恩节，在此首先感恩大家的关注，也和大家做一番交流。很多人关心，我们为什么会在这个时间点推出《秦时明月》的十五周年版？我想说，最主要的原因正是感恩和回馈。\n熟悉秦时明月和玄机的观众都知道，这次的秦时明月十五周年版其实已经是秦时明月第一部的第二次重制。百步飞剑到目前已有三个版本。每一次的重制，我们都将其当作对长久支持我们的观众和粉丝的一份礼物和回馈。\n\n\n其中一个很重要的原因，是我们发现很多月饼不仅自己会经常回顾这部作品，也会向身边的朋友推荐这部曾带给他感动和启发的作品；但确实15年前制作这部动画的技术，从模型的精度甚至到画面的比例，和今天比已不可同日而语。所以这次的秦时明月十五周年版，我们用现在所掌握的最新技术进行了全面优化，以期给大家呈现全新的面貌。通过这些版本的比较，相信大家也能看出玄机在大家支持、鼓励和鞭策下，不断前进，努力做更好的自己。\n\n秦时明月对于玄机的意义是非凡的。应该说玄机在行业中很长一段时间属于比较独特的公司——整整十年时间只做一部作品秦时明月。这一方面是因为行业发展和团队发展的阶段性；但另一方面，通过这样一段时间的沉淀和团队经验累积，我们也更深刻的理解“十年磨一剑”这句话的意义。我们觉得自己很幸运，能够在15周年的时候，有机会和能力再一次重新打磨这部作品。大家可以看到，这部作品相比原来的版本是一个脱胎换骨的升级——从每一个道具、场景的模型，每一个分镜还有动画，包括光影的处理，实际上都是全新的制作。\n\n十五周年版我们内部专门成立了一个极致动画部，主要聚焦动画的表现，如口型、表情、布料物理运算的提升。十五周年版加强的并不是我们已经受肯定较多的场景、建模和光影特效等方面，主要加强的是角色表演的生动性、细腻度和流畅性。这三方面其实不仅仅在角色，更是一个全方位的体现，比如场景，大家可以看…",

          "description": "松露，是个很无厘头的汉语译名。\n\n\n顾名思义，它被比喻为松树凝出的露水。但这种生长在地下的真菌，既不在松树枝干上生长，也不依附松针松根形成的自然生态。橡树、榛树、椴树、榉树、桦树、松树、白杨都可以成为松露的生存环境。松树与松露，从没有必然联系。\n\n\n事实上，直到上世纪80年代，松露在中国的名字依然充满了下里巴人的气息，“土茯苓”“无娘果”“猪拱菌”“臭鸡枞”……松露两字，最早出现在改革开放后的欧美文学译作里。\n\n\n也许在中国的翻译家眼中，最珍贵最美味的食用真菌，天然就应该与松树搭上关系，比如松茸、松树蕈、松蘑、松耳；而露珠本身，则与可食用真菌一样，隐含着无根无蒂、无体无形，采纳天地灵气和日月精华而生的意蕴。\n\n\n一个美丽的名词，从诞生之初，就夹带着狗血的误会。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.1 壹\n\n\n作为一种食物，Truffle准确的译名不是松露，而是“块菌”。从生物学的分类来看，块菌与羊肚菌的亲缘关系很接近，整个欧亚大陆和北美大陆各地，都能出产这种生长在土壤下的真菌。它是一种典型的世界性生物。\n\n\n但东西方对它的态度，却有着天壤之别。西方有着悠久的松露食用史，4000年前，生活在两河流域的苏美尔人，就用楔形文字记载了一个孩子将这种食物献给国王的故事。而到了公元1世纪的古罗马时代，美食家阿比西斯在他的传世名作《厨艺》中，已经详细介绍了松露的吃法：煮熟后串起来，加盐烘烤出焦香；另将葡萄酒、橄榄油、胡椒、蜂蜜、鱼酱和酸葡萄汁一起煮沸，加入淀粉后做成蘸酱；最后在松露上用针刺出小孔，泡进蘸酱里吸取味道。\n\n\n即便到了今天，人工培植相对困难，主要靠野外采集的松露，依然是餐桌上的珍品。但在2000年前，古罗马人已经实现了松露的常态化食用。一方面，贵族的奢靡生活，反映了古代欧洲封建国家的富庶和强大；另一方面，也证明了欧洲人珍视松露的饮食传统。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n在中国，松露的应用就落后很多。上下五千…",

          "description": "开发者来强答一波\n《物理世界》的灵感诞生于CIGA Game Jam 2019上。\n当时的题目是一张这样的图片：\n\n\n\n（看到图片的我亿脸蒙蔽XD）\n但没办法，题还是要做的哇，所以我就在想，这爱心到底怎么插入小人中奖的三角形？\n\n一般正常情况下看到这个问题，肯定是会想到“父母的爱对孩子来说太沉重”，“看起来好的东西不一定适合自己”一类的观点，但可能是我苦于物理荼毒久已，导致我第一时间想到的事居然是——\n\n爱心通过怎样的形态变化能成为三角形，最终契合进小人的内心？我脑内闪过了一万个公式，发现都没有办法解决我的疑惑。\n进而，我联想到了《Baba is you》——一款通过不同的组合方式产生不同的效果，最终解决谜题的作品。\n\n\n\n\n虽然和物理世界不尽相同，但通过不同组合方式，改变角色行动逻辑，最终让角色成功移动到终点的解谜内核触动了我。彼时的我已经把题目图片抛之脑后，满脑子只想的是“我要把各种物理公式嵌进一款解谜游戏中”，让玩家再次体验被物理课堂所支配的......\n就这样，初版的物理世界诞生了。\n\n（老版本的物理世界，当时主角还不是盒娘）\n\n尽管Game Jam很快就结束了，我们对继续制作《物理世界》的热情却丝毫没有熄灭。\n首先，我们决定更换美术素材——黑板的绿底白字让人感觉过于古板，于是我们打算采用更卡通的风格让画面更有活力。\n\n\nGame Jam上制作的版本中的地图的地形均为直接绘制，这不利于后续关卡的搭建和维护。我们首先换用了TileMap插件来搭建地形和绘制方块。但它的自由度不是很高，有些比较不规则的图形无法实现。于是我们又换用了更加自由的SpriteShapeController来编辑地形。\n\n\n继续制作解密游戏最重要的一点就是丰富关卡内容了。为了扩充关卡内容，我们在接下来的时间里制作了更多的关卡，包括摩擦力关卡、浮力关卡、圆周运动关卡以及动量关卡。\n\n 摩擦力关卡\n\n浮力关卡\n\n圆周运动关卡\n\n动量关卡\n一切关卡的设计思路以有趣为前提，为此我们也都是绞尽脑汁，不断迭代我们的作品。\n当内容逐渐丰富之后，游戏主要矛盾逐渐转移到了用户的游玩体验之上。\n在游玩《Baba is you》的过程中，尽管你会被他惊艳的创意所折服，但有时也会莫名其妙的过关弄昏头脑。\n如果玩家与设计者的脑洞没有对上，关卡的乐趣就会骤减，原本精妙的解谜关卡设置在玩家眼中可能会“过于电波系”，让玩家一头雾水，卡关的挫败感也许会让他们不再打开这部作品。\n\n为了解决这样的问题，在设计比较复杂的关卡的时候，我们或有意或无意地留下了多于一种的过关方式。\n\n\n\n\n在这个关卡中，你可以选择黄色和紫色方块中任何一个用于垫脚\n\n我们加入了提示系统以避免避免玩家长时间的卡关导致失去兴趣的情况出现，但于此同时，我们也不会给予玩家包办式的过关引导——玩家依然需要去考虑如何实现提示系统中的各条提示，它们一般都不会太难，只是需要花点时间。\n\n\n同时，为了玩家能够更好地get到我们设计时的脑洞，我们也特地的在靠前的引导关卡中以更简单的方法呈现给玩家。\n\n这个关卡的过关方式中需要用方块将红色小旗撞下来。\n在本作最开始的测试中，许多玩家第一次看到这样的关卡时，往往无法第一时间悟到本关的解谜机制，最终会因为定式思维卡关很久。\n我们注意到了这点，于是在较为前面的关卡中加入了这样的一关来进行引导。\n\n这关需要玩家用蓝色方块将红色小旗撞下\n这样一来，玩家能更容易地理解并利用这样的机制进行解密。\n在游戏进行测试的过程中我们发现，有的玩家在一开始就难以理解这个游戏的机制——用物理公式来控制场上的物体。甚至在第一关就不知所措。于是我们又额外增加了教程关卡来解决这个问题。\n\n\n教程关中通过文字一步步的指导，让玩家了解游戏的机制以及游玩思路——这成功地降低了游戏的上手难度，也让这部作品能够得以有机会被更多用户所看到。\n一起来体验《物理世界》的美妙吧！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n团长大人\n点击下载\n2 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么现在好多单机游戏都做开放世界？\n怪猎世界中有什么整活的流派？",

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n这场比赛的焦点，在于浓眉对字母在攻防两端的表现。相比起字母哥的在球场两端的发挥，浓眉看上去似乎落了下风。“美国杨毅”史密斯怒斥了浓眉的“回击乏力”，虎扑湖人区更是以“浓眉夺冠赛季后的堕落不自律”为主题，进行了心理与身体状态上的大讨论。然而，如果细究比赛进程，从全局出发，浓眉在进攻端还是发挥出了重要的作用，而在防守端对字母的防守丢分，也更多来自于一种体系中定位的无奈。相应地，威少的进攻端表现则受到了沃格尔的表扬，“打出了湖人生涯最好的一场比赛”。\n那么，浓眉的作用是如何发挥的？威少的表现上升，与浓眉有无关联？本场比赛的湖人，是否有一些让人看到一些希望——他们最需要这个，最起码得有“盼头”——的比赛内容呢？\n\n在这支湖人队中，浓眉的防守任务是非常沉重的。在近期的比赛中，湖人常规性地使用了三后卫的阵容。这一排法，当然是为了在现有资源的现实前提下、尽量为威少缓解防守压力。本赛季，威少在防守挡拆持球人时，平均每回合让对手得到0.83分，每场需要完成3.6个回合，占他总防守比例的35.1%.而同队的布拉德利与里弗斯，防守挡拆的回合数比威少还略多0.1和0.2，每回合对手得分只有0.79和0.57分。\n而在防守轮转后的弱侧盯人中，威少也往往难以做出正确的判断----他已经在执行湖人防守体系的换防要求，大量增加了防守中的移动，每个防守回合中的移动距离排名队内第一，并非在每个回合中都是蹲篮下等待篮板的懒散存在，但却由于对进攻阅读的不准、防守沟通的不力，他在移动上往往显得犹犹豫豫、去而复返，无效跑动很多，加上运动能力的消耗，便很难执行出坚决、效率的到位换防，防守端的平均移动速度排名队内倒数第三。这就导致了威少在防守端制造的“窟窿”效果：上场时，对手每百回合可以得到109.9分，而下场后湖人反而压到了103.8分。\n\n威少在场上的正向作用主要是进攻端的球权消化，在防…",

          "description": "平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。\n首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。\n《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。\n其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。\n然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）\n1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。\n\n游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。\n2. 关于形状的错觉。\n\n一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。\n3. 颜色的错觉。\n\n\n这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）\n4. 负空间。\n\n在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。\n5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）\n\n虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。\n6. 倒影或平面变成实体\n\n挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。\n7. 透过遮罩的场景\n\n我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？\n8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方\n\n这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。\n游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。\n第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nmonokura\n点击下载\n53 个回答，查看全部。\n《纪念碑谷》里有哪些难以发现的细节？\n纪念碑谷为什么会火？",

          "description": "《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。\n番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。\n当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。\n至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。\n第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。\n第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。\n最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。\n以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nhaolin\n点击下载\n40 个回答，查看全部。\n动画《时光代理人》已经完结，如何评价这部作品？\n谁是动画史上最糟糕的角色？为什么？",

          "description": "「时光不负，创作不停，本文正在参加2021年终总结征文大赛」\n\n\n\n大家好，太久没有发文章了。\n很多朋友关注这个号可能是因为学习 React Naitve 的过程中，看到了我前几年在网上分享的 RN 的文章。至今都有人通过公众号找到我，问我 RN 的东西。\n我已经没有在使用 RN 了，也没有继续关注 RN 社区了。因为现在全面转到 Flutter 了，从 2019 年开始到现在，也已经有好几个项目在生产环境中投产了，表现的都还不错。\n无论是从性能表现，还是开发体验，Flutter 都要优于 RN，唯一不足的可能就是 Dart 增加了一些入门的门槛。但其实都是较为现代编程语言，无论你之前使用的是 Kotlin，Swift，JS， TS，其实都能找到很多相同的地方。比如变量的声明，数据结构等，所以我觉得那一点代价可以忽略不计。\n尤其在我自己饱受了几年 RN 的红屏之苦，还有那完全靠运气随机表现的 Hot Reload 功能，都是促使我切换到 Flutter 的原因。\n以上有点扯远了，只不过因为时不时就有人加我微信问诸如此类的问题，所以难得写一篇文章就顺便也说一下我个人的想法。可能会对一些正在犹豫的，考虑二选一的朋友们提供一些参考。\nDemo演示\n下面说回到正文上来，先看一段 Demo 吧。\n\n我个人有定期备份照片的习惯，之前没有微信的时候，大家用优盘来共享照片，所以那个时候文件都能很好的被管理。因为照片的 EXIF 信息很完整。但是自从有了微信以后，我有很多照片都是来自于家人或者朋友的微信，估计很多人和我一样，尤其是有了小孩以后。\n大家应该都知道，微信保存照片的名称，一般都是一段 'mmexport' 前缀加上一个时间戳，这对于整理大量图片来说特别不友好，因为我希望照片可以按照事件发生的时间按月整理，但是微信导出图片视频的这个时间戳，是你保存图片的那个时间，而且时间戳也没有办法一眼让我分辨出这是几月份拍摄的。\n最开始我想的是找一个可以批量重命名的软件，但是很快又发现一个问题，这些软件们，基本都只能定义一个策略，所有的图片都只能用创建时间，更新时间或者记录时间中的一个来批量重命名。\n\n然而不知道什么原因，我发现有些照片的 Exif 信息并不完整，要么没有记录时间，要么就是创建时间晚于更新时间。我想应该是被一些其他的比如修图软件之类 App 编辑过吧。所以这个策略就会增加一些人工过滤的成本。\n所以我就想只要在批量重命名的时候，选择创建时间，更新时间，记录时间，微信时间戳中，最早的一个时间来作为文件名的一部分就可以了。刚开始想的是写一个脚本来处理这个事就好了，但是转到 Flutter 以后还没有用它开发过桌面端，所以就想顺便试一下。\n开发历程\n经过两天的开发，现在软件基本核心的重命名的功能已经实现了，UI也大概完成了30%左右吧。本来抱着试一试的态度，没想到 Flutter 真的可以（可能写个脚本用起来更方便）。\n再一次觉得 Flutter 才是跨平台开发的未来，这种轻而易举就可以将业务扩展到其他平台的能力，真的太有想象空间了。\n尽管这个项目初衷只想面向桌面端（macOS，windows）而已，但是我也在手机上试了下，大体上也可以用，只不过UI可能有点奇怪。所以暂时先不打算适配手机端了。\n要问我什么时候可以用？我想大概就是在可以用的时候吧。（废话学么，谁不会？上一次听到这种废话，还是在上一次！）。其实主要是我自己也不知道，因为并不打算上架收费，咱们就是说，咱们这边纯纯的就一个是“激情开发，用爱发电”，所以可能随时因为一些不可抗力就终止了（比如懒，哈哈哈~）。如果一不小心写完了，也会在公众号里通知一下的。\n做个小调研吧，不知道你们是否需要这个软件呢？可以评论下。\n最后，想问下有没有哪个小伙伴愿意帮忙设计一下 UI 和 Logo 呢？因为没有收入所以也只能是义务劳动了，先提前谢谢了。\n以防有人问，目前没有打算开源。",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",

Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok \"For You Page\"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?\n\nThanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!\nYou can check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/kayleymelissa\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: hhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nMadi Price\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nThanks to @Vort3xDragon for making the scavenger hunt, this was epic!\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/6dug29UrRH\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

Although The Seven have outposts all throughout the Island, the tropics are home to their home, the “Sanctuary.” This compound is right next to the coast, where you can get a clear view of the colossal rock statue of The Foundation.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",

It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. \n\nI saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.\n\nHalo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. \n\nSo again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release\n\n\nSUPPORT the Channel ► https://www.patreon.com/TheActMan \n\n____TIME STAMPS____\nIntroduction – 0:00 \nDisappointing News – 4:03\nLack of Content – 7:23\nGame Modes & Playlists – 11:08 \nCustom Games are Broken – 20:05\nFinal Thoughts – 28:33\n\n✪ CONNECT WITH ME ✪ \nSubscribe ↪ https://www.youtube.com/c/TheActMan?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter ➤ https://twitter.com/TheActMan_YT \nAct Man TV ➤ http://bit.ly/2kPXk7f  \n\nDiscord ➤ https://discord.gg/yBABtkh  \nInstagram ➤ https://www.instagram.com/theactman_yt/ \nXbox Live Gamertag ➤ The Act Man",

With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.\n\nAbout Peacock: The streaming service from NBCUniversal that’s as free as a bird. Current hits. Timeless classics. Timely updates. Stream Now With Peacock, stream current hits, hundreds of movies, thousands of episodes of TV shows, and exclusive Originals – plus timely news, live sports, WWE, and daily pop culture.

However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it's actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive.
