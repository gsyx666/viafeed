But Warp is the new kid on the block, and although it comes with some downsides, it's pretty slick!\nTry our Warp here\nThis new terminal is made from scratch, not based on what we already know about terminals.\nThis, to me, is what makes it so cool. The whole terminal experience changes and makes it feel like a native app.\nIt's super quick to autocomplete and separate commands, so it's easy to understand which output belongs to which command.\nBesides these apparent wins, it's also super fast and comes with Intellisense for npm and git. You'll never forget a command this way.\n\nTo be honest, there are always downsides, aren't there.\nIt's only available for Mac, but the team seems to be working hard on a Windows and Linux version.\nIt's not open source, this might not be a bad hard point, but for some people, that's a deal-breaker.\nYou need to log in, which seems weird to use a terminal.\nI hope they are not using this personal data to keep track of our terminal usage, as it's now connected to a user profile.\nWorth a try if you're on Mac. It's pretty awesome to use.\nTry our Warp here\nThank you for reading my blog. Feel free to subscribe to my email newsletter and connect on Facebook or Twitter",

          "description": "Hello World !\nS Soumyakanta.\nIt's important to learn things in a structured way. After all I found Free Code Camp  on web and Youtube. As a beginner I was making the same mistake again and again. But from the Free Code Camp's Youtube channel I found Per Harald Borgen's free beginner level full Javascript course. It was a interactive course on Scrimba.com.\nIt was important for me to practice online to boost my journey. I know you may ask their are many online code learning platform's then why Scrimba !!! then here are some answers why as newbie should learn JS from Scimba's Learn JavaScript for free !\n1. If you haven't a high end device:- For this course you only need a PC(1 GB Ram),Internet and a browser(Chrome suggested). Your journey will not stop due to lack of resources. You don't need to run several application to start.\n2.If you're a beginner:-I struggled hard to learn code by self ,in the way to my web development journey. I love to learn things by doing practical application in real world. This course will teach you Javascript by creating three projects like Passenger counter app, Blackjack game and a chrome extension.\n3.Fun and Zero distraction:- While learning from Youtube as a newbie I was so distracted by other recommended videos. In this course it was simple for me to stay focused. This course is amazingly delivered by Mr. Per . You will learn several things by doing challenges in this course.\nMy Suggestion to beginners:-After searching several platform's  I would suggest to learn Javascript from Scrimba. Don't waste so much time on watching random videos one after one to learn. It's a 7 hour long video and I assure you that you're  going to enjoy it.\nFor Mr. Per:- Hello sir ! thanks for your teaching. Your course impacted my life. It's my humble gratitude to you. Thanks a lot.\nI hope this review will help you to start journey in a productive way.\nIf you are reading this I will happy that we will stay connected.

Accessors\nDo not use JavaScript getters/setters as they cause unexpected side effects and are harder to test, maintain, and reason about. Instead, if you do make accessor functions, use getVal() and setVal('hello').\n// bad\nclass Dragon {\n  get age() {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  set age(value) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n// good\nclass Dragon {\n  getAge() {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  setAge(value) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nIf the property/method is a boolean, use isVal() or hasVal().\n// bad\nif (!dragon.age()) {\n  return false;\n}\n\n// good\nif (!dragon.hasAge()) {\n  return false;\n}\n\nIt’s okay to create get() and set() functions, but be consistent.\nclass Jedi {\n  constructor(options = {}) {\n    const lightsaber = options.lightsaber || 'blue';\n    this.set('lightsaber', lightsaber);\n  }\n\n  set(key, val) {\n    this[key] = val;\n  }\n\n  get(key) {\n    return this[key];\n  }\n}\n\n2. Events\n// bad\n$(this).trigger('listingUpdated', listing.id);\n\n// ...\n\n$(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, listingID) => {\n  // do something with listingID\n});\n\n// good\n$(this).trigger('listingUpdated', { listingID: listing.id });\n\n// ...\n\n$(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, data) => {\n  // do something with data.listingID\n});\n\n3. jQuery\n// bad\nconst sidebar = $('.sidebar');\n\n// good\nconst $sidebar = $('.sidebar');\n\n// good\nconst $sidebarBtn = $('.sidebar-btn');\n\n// bad\nfunction setSidebar() {\n  $('.sidebar').hide();\n\n  // ...\n\n  $('.sidebar').css({\n    'background-color': 'pink',\n  });\n}\n\n// good\nfunction setSidebar() {\n  const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');\n  $sidebar.hide();\n\n  // ...\n\n  $sidebar.css({\n    'background-color': 'pink',\n  });\n}\n\nFor DOM queries use Cascading $('.sidebar ul') or parent > child $('.sidebar > ul'). jsPerf\nUse find with scoped jQuery object queries.\n// bad\n$('ul', '.sidebar').hide();\n\n// bad\n$('.sidebar').find('ul').hide();\n\n// good\n$('.sidebar ul').hide();\n\n// good\n$('.sidebar > ul').hide();\n\n// good\n$sidebar.find('ul').hide();\n\nThanks for your time.\nBest regards.",

          "description": "相信 AI 有生命的谷歌工程师被勒令休假\n\r\n谷歌的一位 AI 工程师 Blake Lemoine，从去年秋天开始与公司的聊天机器人 LaMDA 对话。LaMDA 运用了谷歌最先进的大型语言模型，使用从互联网上收集的数万亿词汇进行训练。在与 LaMDA 交流期间，他认为 AI 有了意识。比如他问 LaMDA 最害怕什么？LaMDA 回答说，它恐惧于被关闭。他继续追问：就像死亡？LaMDA 说：就像是死亡。因此，Blake 认为这证明 LaMDA 有了意识。在向上级展示了证据无果后他决定公开这件事，然后被公司勒令休假。在被封锁账号前，他给有 200 人的谷歌机器学习列表发帖说，“LaMDA 是有意识的，……是一个可爱的孩子，……我不在的时候请好好照顾它。”不独是 Blake，也有其它谷歌专家认为神经网络这种模仿人脑的架构，正在向意识迈进。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MSN\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不是工程师疯了，就是 AI 成精了 —— 国外的建国后允许成精。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n因硬盘故障，数十个 GitLab 开源项目开发受阻\n\r\nFreeDesktop.org 的 GitLab 服务承载着 Mesa、X.Org、Wayland，以及 LibreOffice 和 GStreamer 等开源项目。由于硬盘故障，FreeDesktop.org 的 GitLab 从 11 日某个时间开始一直处于关闭状态，并且没有恢复正常的预告时间。管理员们在努力恢复硬盘 RAID，但到目前为止没有结果。而且，两位管理员还宣布要休息一天。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然由于 Git 的特性，开源仓库内的数据基本上不会受到损害，但是这个事故其实暴露了很多开源项目在基础设施投入方面的不足。而且，我觉得国外的工程师们心里素质真好，无论如何该休息也是要休息的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开源软件公司 Odoo 估值 32 亿欧元\n\r\n总部位于比利时的 Odoo 公司成立于 2005 年，为全球中小企业提供一体化的商业软件，专注于开源的 ERP 和 CRM 软件。在不到一年前得到了 1.8 亿欧元投资，估值 20 亿欧元后，最近得到的 1.12 亿欧元使其估值进一步提高到 32 亿欧元。该公司计划在全球范围内开设六家新办事处并增聘约 1800 名员工。Odoo 目前有 700 多万用户在使用它的解决方案，预计今年的营业额约为 3 亿欧元，并少量盈利。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：tech.eu\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：开源技术公司越来越得到投资界的青睐，不过前提是属于头部。",

          "description": "6 月 13 日，阿里云智能总裁张建锋在峰会上正式发布 CIPU（Cloud infrastructure Processing Units），这是为新型云数据中心设计的专用处理器，未来将替代 CPU 成为云计算的管控和加速中心。\n\r\n在这个全新体系架构下，CIPU 向下对数据中心的计算、存储、网络资源快速云化并进行硬件加速，向上接入飞天云操作系统，将全球数百万台服务器连成一台超级计算机。 \n\r\n\n\r\n阿里云智能总裁张建锋发布 CIPU\n\r\n例如，CIPU 与计算结合，快速接入不同类型资源的服务器，带来算力的“0”损耗，以及硬件级安全的加固隔离；CIPU 与存储结合，对存算分离架构的块存储接入进行硬件加速，云盘存储 IOPS 最高可达 300 万，长尾时延降低 50%；CIPU 与网络结合，可对高带宽物理网络进行硬件加速，构建大规模弹性 RDMA 高性能网络，时延最低可达 5us。\n\r\n\n\r\nCIPU 架构示意图\n\r\n基于 CIPU 和飞天的新一代云计算架构体系，在通用计算、大数据、人工智能等核心场景的计算测试中展现了优越的性能。在通用分布式计算领域，Redis 性能提升了 68%、MySQL 提升了 60%，Nginx 提升了 30%；高吞吐类的互联网业务上云之后，比自建物理机的集群吞吐量提升了 30%，业务高峰期延迟下降了 90%；在大数据和AI等计算与数据双密集场景下，相比传统的 TCP 网络，弹性 RDMA 高性能网络的吞吐能力提升 30% 以上；云原生方面，容器启动速度快了 350%，在 Serverless 场景下 6 秒可拉起 3000 个弹性容器实例。\n\r\n\n\r\nCIPU 特性简介\n\r\n为什么要有 CIPU？张建锋认为，过去十多年，云计算技术经历了两个发展阶段：第一阶段是分布式和虚拟化技术替代了大型机，满足了当时企业所需的算力规模；第二阶段出现了资源池化技术，以阿里巴巴为例，通过计算存储分离架构，将计算、存储、网络资源分别池化，突破了规模和稳定性的瓶颈，提供了超大规模的云计算服务。\n\r\n但随着数据密集型计算场景的普及，用户对低时延、高带宽的需求也越来越高，传统以 CPU 为中心的计算体系架构无法适应这一趋势。为了解决这一问题，阿里云相关研发团队早在 2015 年就开始技术攻关，并于 2017 年推出业内首款虚拟化损耗为零的神龙云服务器。经过多年自研迭代，神龙、弹性 RDMA 等核心技术不断深入垂直整合，演进出以 CIPU 为中心的全新架构形态，云计算开始进入第三阶段。\n\r\n阿里云还不断夯实技术底座，建立了自研的芯片、服务器、飞天操作系统等软硬一体的基础设施。这些基础设施有力支撑了阿里云产品的四大核心：神龙计算、盘古存储、洛神网络和安全内核。在国际权威机构 Gartner 发布的年度报告里，阿里云获得计算、存储、网络、安全 4 项单项最高分以及 IaaS 整体基础设施能力的全球最高分。",

          "description": "计算机历史博物馆恢复了 21 部 1976 年传奇性计算机会议的视频\n\r\n在 1976 年夏天，来自世界各地的数十位计算机领域的顶级工程师、科学家和软件先锋们聚集在一起，在美国洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室聚会了五天，回顾了计算机界的前 25 年历史。在这些修复的视频中，与会者们讲述了许多当时鲜为人知的事情。比如，美国最早的大型电子计算机 ENIAC 的共同发明人约翰•毛奇里讨论了它的严重问题，ENIAC 必须每天 24 小时保持通电，以保持其 18000 个真空管的健康。计算机历史学家布莱恩•兰德尔教授首次披露了英国二战时期破译德军密码的专用计算机，还介绍了艾伦•图灵在二战时发挥的重大作用。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CHM\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：之前在翻译红帽《代码英雄》系列播客时接触过这段历史的一部分，真是想想波澜壮阔啊。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n秘密运行中的世界上最强大的超级计算机\n\r\n在最近一期的 TOP500 中，美国橡树岭国家实验室建造的 Frontier 以第一个 E 级超算夺得了榜首。TOP500 测量的是一台机器通过运行名为 LINPACK 基准的软件解决大量方程式的速度，这给出了一个以每秒浮点运算（FLOPS）为单位的数值。但并不是所有的超级计算机都会被列出，只有在其所有者运行该基准并提交结果的情况下才会出现在榜单。很多机构，包括一些大学都不会提交其基准数据来加入榜单。超级计算机专家们的 共识 是，中国自 2021 年以来至少有两台被称为“海洋之光”和“天河三号”的超大规模机器在运行，并且正在由曙光研发的第三台超算达到了 2E 级。这些“秘密”超算的数据是通过一些不相关的论文披露出来的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MSN\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：只能说通过上榜来获取自信心的时代已经过去了，现在大家都埋头竞争呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n通用汽车用 3D 打印来解决汽车生产短缺的零件\n\r\n通用汽车在 2020 年对 3D 打印技术进行了重大投资，建立了 1.5 万平方英尺面积的增材制造中心。雪佛兰的工程师们对一款新的 SUV 的设计做了一个后期改动，需要创造一个额外的零件，以填补了尾部的一个缺口。开发注射成型的模具将花费太多时间，从而延误了 3 万辆汽车的交付。通过 3D 打印，工程师们能够快速设计并使用符合通用汽车标准的柔性材料打印出这些部件。而从设计到完成只用了五个星期。这还不到走注射成型路线所需时间的一半。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNET\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然成本高点，但是在这种应急的时候还真是非常灵活，也节省了很多时间成本。",

          "description": "虽然音乐世界被流媒体服务所主导，但这并没有阻止开发者为桌面电脑创建音乐播放器。\n\r\n最近，我发现了一个外观漂亮的新的 Linux 桌面音乐播放器。它名为 Amberol，我被它的美丽所震撼。\n\r\n\n\r\n看起来不错，不是吗？让我们仔细看看它。\n\r\nAmberol，Linux 上的可爱的音乐播放器\n\r\n看起来不错是它所做的两件（或几件）事情中的一件。另一件事是播放音乐。\n\r\n这就是它，Amberol 没有额外的花哨（和有用）的功能，如生成专辑封面、元数据编辑、歌词显示或播放列表和库管理。\n\r\n这些功能也不像是会在未来的版本中加入。Amberol 只想播放音乐。就是这样。\n\r\n令人惊叹的用户界面\n\r\nAmberol 和大多数新的 GNOME 应用一样，是用 Rust 和 GTK 编写的。\n\r\n它有一个自适应的用户界面，可以根据你正在播放的专辑颜色来改变颜色。渐变效果给了它一个现代、时尚的外观，肯定会成为你的 Linux 美化Ricing截图的一部分。\n\r\n\n\r\n由于其 UI 没有传统的手柄和菜单，它给应用一个统一的外观。\n\r\n播放列表\n\r\n它会从你添加的文件夹中的文件自动生成一个播放列表，显示在左手边的侧边栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以在左上角看到整个播放列表将播放多长时间的音乐。点击“勾选”符号，你可以选择歌曲，并从播放列表中删除它们。\n\r\n如果你愿意，可以隐藏播放列表的侧边栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n音乐播放选项\n\r\n你可以在界面上看到歌曲的进度。该播放器与键盘上的媒体控制按钮整合得很好。你可以用专用的媒体键来播放、暂停和改变曲目（如果你的系统上有）。\n\r\nAmberol 为你提供了一些播放音乐的选项。你可以打开随机播放功能，按随机顺序播放音乐。你也可以单曲循环，直到你厌倦它。\n\r\n\n\r\n底部的汉堡菜单让你可以选择添加文件或文件夹，并显示可用的键盘快捷方式。\n\r\n\n\r\n你也可以从这里禁用 UI 颜色变化以配合专辑封面。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Amberol\n\r\nAmberol 是 以 Flatpak 形式提供的。请确保 你的系统已启用 Flatpak 支持。\n\r\n要安装 Amberol，请打开终端并使用以下命令：\n\r\nflatpak install flathub io.bassi.Amberol\r\n\n\r\n安装完毕后，在菜单中搜索该应用，并点击启动。\n\r\n第一次运行时，它会要求你添加音乐文件或文件夹。你也可以拖放文件播放。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n就个人而言，我更喜欢流媒体服务，因为我没有本机音乐珍藏。但我知道有的人有大量的 CD 收藏，现在都保存在硬盘上。\n\r\nAmberol 是一个外观漂亮的应用，对于播放本机音乐来说，它足够好。最吸引人的是它基于专辑封面的自适应用户界面。\n\r\n请你试试它，并在评论区分享你的经验。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/amberol-music-player/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "嗨，伙计们，在这篇指南中，我们将演示如何在 Windows 11 的之外配置 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS（Jammy Jellyfish）的双启动设置。\n\r\n为使其能工作，你需要在你的计算机上已经安装好了 Windows 11 。接下来，你将需要在你的硬盘驱动器上创建一个单独的分区，你将在此分区上安装 Ubuntu 22.04 。我们将包含这点知识，因此不要担心。\n\r\n前置条件：\n\r\n在设置双启动前，这些是你所需要的：\n\r\n\r\n一个 Ubuntu 22.04 的可启动 USB 驱动器，你可以转到 Ubuntu 22.04 下载页面 来下载 Ubuntu 22.04 的 ISO 镜像文件。在 ISO 镜像文件到位后，拿一个 16GB USB 驱动器，并使用 Rufus 应用程序来使其可启动。\n\r\n快速稳定的互联网连接\n\r\n\r\n步骤 1、在你的硬盘驱动器上创建一个可用的分区\n\r\n正如介绍中所提到的，我们首先需要在硬盘驱动器上创建一个单独的分区，我们将在其中安装 Ubuntu 22.04 。\n\r\n因此，通过按下 Windows + R 组合键来打开磁盘管理器实用程序。\n\r\n在对话框中，输入 diskmgmt.msc ，并按下回车键。\n\r\n\n\r\n磁盘管理disk management控制台将显示当前磁盘分区，如你将在下面所看到的一样。我们将通过压缩 “卷 E” 来创建一个用于安装 Ubuntu 的分区。这在你的安装过程中可能有所不同，但是只需要跟着做，你就会理解其中的大体意思。\n\r\n\n\r\n因此，在你想要压缩的磁盘驱动器卷上点击鼠标右键，并在弹出的菜单中选择 压缩卷Shrink 选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n将会出现一个弹出对话框，如下所示。具体指定压缩的控件大小（以 MB 为单位），并单击 压缩卷Shrink 。\n\r\n这是指定给 Ubuntu 22.04 安装所用的空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n在缩…",

          "description": "Linux 发现一个“几乎不能被检测到”的寄生木马\n\r\n安全研究人员发现了一款名为 “Symbiote”（共生体）的恶意软件。他们称其“几乎不可能被检测到”。它会“寄生感染”系统，感染所有正在运行的进程，并为提供 Rootkit 功能、远程访问等。它最早在 2021 年 11 月被发现，似乎是针对金融部门特别开发的。它不是一个以感染机器的独立可执行文件的形式运行的，而是以一个共享对象库的形式加载到所有正在运行的进程中，并寄生感染机器。它采用了多种规避检测的手段，来隐藏文件、进程和网络流量，甚至能让 BPF 工具也无法发现其网络流量。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：黑莓\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实通过共享对象库寄生的木马并不稀奇，只是这个木马做了更多的隐藏手段，可见现在针对 Linux 的木马也越来越强大隐蔽了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 正在改进对低成本 RISC-V 主板 VisionFive 的支持\n\r\n最近 Ubuntu 开发人员一直在努力提高和改善对赛昉科技的 VisionFive 单板机的支持，有望在 Ubuntu 22.10 中看到对这种低于 180 美元的 RISC-V 计算机的良好支持。VisionFive 是为数不多的不超过 200 美元的、能运行完整 Linux 发行版的 RISC-V 主板之一。自 Linux 5.17 内核开始，就对 VisionFive v1 板提供了主线支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：目前这个板子还是比较缺货的，希望能在 Ubuntu 等发行版提供更好的支持时能解决供货问题。有对在这个板子上运行 Ubuntu 感兴趣的同学吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n推特联合创始人宣布 Web3 的竞争对手：Web5\n\r\n推特联合创始人 Jack Dorsey 认为 Web3 变得和之前的 Web2 一样有问题，对未来抗审查、注重隐私的互联网来说还只是个梦想。现在，他旗下的区块链公司 TBD 创造了一个新名词 Web5，将通过放弃以区块链为中心的方法来实现无审查、以身份为中心的网络体验，从而击败现有的模式。他们所宣称的技术可能和 BT、Tor 类似。目前这个所谓的 Web5 仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Coindesk\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：生造名词的技术“创新”，并没有什么意义，就像十多年前 Web2 刚刚初露头角时就有人宣称 Web3，但是到现在连 Web3 也并没有真正得到共识和认可。更别说所谓的 Web5，我就想知道，Web4 怎么了，是 4 不吉利么。此外，其视为典范的，无论是 BT 还是 Tor，都太过于激进了。",

          "description": "GitHub 正式宣布终止 Atom 项目\n\r\nGitHub 是在 2011 年宣布 Atom，2015 年 5 月发布了 1.0 版本，并吸引了数百万开发者使用。而微软在 2015 年推出的 VS Code 也是受到了 Atom 的启发。在 2018 年微软收购 GitHub 后，Atom 成为了微软的项目。在社区对 Atom 前景的担忧之下，GitHub 承诺不会放弃 Atom。但过去几年 Atom 除了安全更新外几乎没有什么改进。而 Atom 和 VS Code 的用户数此消彼长，Stack Overflow 的 2021 年度开发者调查结果表明，仅 13% 开发者将 Atom 当做主力开发环境，而 VS Code 却高达 71%。最后，Atom 还留下了一个重要遗产，它所分拆出来的 Electron 框架被数以千计的应用广泛使用，其中包括 VS Code、Slack 和 GitHub Desktop 等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GitHub\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实可以想到，当年社区对 GitHub 被收购的担忧并非无的放矢。可惜了 Atom，至今我还对 Atom 1.0 那时候的那个 宣传视频 记忆尤深。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIETF 正式颁布 HTTP/3 推荐标准 RFC 9114\n\r\n作为超文本传输协议的第三个大版本，它确定了 QUIC 包含的 HTTP/2 功能，并描述了如何将 HTTP/2 扩展迁移至 HTTP/3。QUIC 全称为“快速 UDP 互联网连接”，由谷歌创建并于 2013 年发布。其旨在化解 TCP 需要多次来回握手，才能建立连接并开始传输数据的短板。早在 IETF 颁布 HTTP/3 的意见征求稿前，谷歌就已经将 QUIC 支持内嵌于 Chrome 浏览器，并在谷歌的诸多服务上启用。Web 流量观测表明 HTTP/3 的流量已超过 HTTP/1.1。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我记得 HTTP/2 也不过才几年，现在都要开始普及 HTTP/3。真是风水轮流转，谁想到最主要的互联网应用 HTTP 最终会从 TCP 转向 UDP 呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌再次打破圆周率计算纪录，计算出百万亿位\n\r\n早在 2019 年，谷歌云服务就已经打破了圆周率的计算纪录，计算出了 31.4 万亿位。周三，谷歌云再次宣布打破了百万亿位的圆周率计算纪录。这 百万亿位圆周率 的最后 10 位是：30952 95560。谷歌云表示，其借助计算引擎服务完成了本次新挑战，用到了 N2 机器家族、虚拟网卡、100 Gbps 网络带宽，以及平衡持久磁盘等新功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：谷歌\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看似无用的圆周率计算，其实是谷歌云一次炫技的展示。有人说，任何大小的数字都能在圆周率的某个片段找到。不说百万亿位了，你能背出多少位圆周率呢？",

          "description": "编译软件在你如何运行你的系统方面给你很大的灵活性。LD_LIBRARY_PATH 变量，以及 GCC 的 -L 和 -l 选项，是这种灵活性的组成部分。\n\r\n\r\n编译软件是开发者经常做的事情，在开源世界中，一些用户甚至选择自己动手。Linux 播客 Dann Washko 称源码为“通用包格式”，因为它包含了使一个应用在任何平台上运行所需的所有组件。当然，并不是所有的源码都是为所有的系统编写的，所以它只是在目标系统的子集内是“通用”的，但问题是，源码是非常灵活的。有了开源，你可以决定代码的编译和运行方式。\n\r\n当你在编译代码时，你通常要处理多个源文件。开发人员倾向于将不同的类或模块放在不同的文件中，这样它们可以被单独维护，甚至可能被不同的项目使用。但当你编译这些文件时，许多文件会被编译成一个可执行文件。\n\r\n这通常是通过创建共享库来完成的，然后从可执行文件中动态链接回它们。这样可以通过保持模块化功能的外部性来保持可执行文件的小型化，并确保库可以独立于使用它们的应用而被更新。\n\r\n在编译过程中定位一个共享对象\n\r\n当你 用 GCC 编译 时，你通常需要在你的工作站上安装一个库，以便 GCC 能够定位到它。默认情况下，GCC 假定库在系统库路径中，例如 /lib64 和 /usr/lib64。然而，如果你要链接到一个你自己的尚未安装的库，或者你需要链接到一个没有安装在标准位置的库，那么你必须帮助 GCC 找到这些文件。\n\r\n有两个选项对于在 GCC 中寻找库很重要：\n\r\n\r\n-L（大写字母 L）在 GCC 的搜索位置上增加一个额外的库路径。\n\r\n-l（小写字母 L）设置你要链接的库的名字。\n\r\n\r\n例如，假设你写了一个叫做 libexample.so 的库，并且你想在编译你的应用 demo.c 时使用它。首先，从 demo.c 创建一个对象文件：\n\r\n$ gcc -I ./in…",

          "description": "机器学习基本上是人工智能的一个子集，它使用以前存在的数据对新数据进行预测。\n\r\n\r\n当然，现在我们所有人都知道这个道理了！这篇文章展示了如何将 Python 中开发的机器学习模型作为 Java 代码的一部分来进行预测。\n\r\n\n\r\n本文假设你熟悉基本的开发技巧并理解机器学习。我们将从训练我们的模型开始，然后在 Python 中制作一个机器学习模型。\n\r\n我以一个洪水预测模型为例。首先，导入以下库：\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\n\r\n当我们成功地导入了这些库，我们就需要输入数据集，如下面的代码所示。为了预测洪水，我使用的是河流水位数据集。\n\r\nfrom google.colab import files\r\nuploaded = files.upload()\r\nfor fn in uploaded.keys(): \r\n    print('User uploaded file \"{name}\" with length {length} bytes'.format(name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))\r\n\n\r\n如果没有选择文件的话，选择上传的文件。\n\r\n只有在当前浏览器会话中执行了该单元格时，上传部件才可用。请重新运行此单元，上传文件 Hoppers Crossing-Hourly-River-Level.csv，大小 2207036 字节。\n\r\n完成后，我们就可以使用 sklearn 库来训练我们的模型。为此，我们首先需要导入该库和算法模型，如图 1 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\nregressor = LinearRegression()\r\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\n\r\n完成后，我们就训练好了我们的模型，现在可以进行预测了，如图 2 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Java 中使用 ML 模型\n\r\n我们现在需要做的是把 ML 模型转换成一个可以被 Java 程序使用的模型。有一个叫做 sklearn2pmml 的库可以帮助我们做到这一点：\n\r\n# Install the library\r\npip install sklearn2pmml\r\n\n\r\n库安装完毕后，我们就可以转换我们已经训练好的模型，如下图所示：\n\r\nsklearn2pmml(pipeline, ‘model.pmml’, with_repr = True)\r\n\n\r\n这就完成了！我们现在可以在我们的 Java 代码中使用生成的 model.pmml 文件来进行预测。请试一试吧！\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：Java 中有第三方库 jpmml/jpmml-evaluator，它能帮助你使用生成的 model.pmml 进行预测。）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/05/using-a-machine-learning-model-to-make-predictions/\n\r\n作者：Jishnu Saurav Mittapalli 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "《中国高血压防治指南（2018修订版）》中将有氧运动确定为高血压的防治手段之一，规律的有氧运动在降低血压方面的作用是显著的，长期规律的有氧运动能使高血压患者的收缩压降低12.3mmHg，舒张压降低6.1mmHg。相比于药物治疗，有氧运动的毒副作用小，且经济成本更低。\n\n有氧运动有代替药物治疗的可能吗？\n有氧运动能否代替药物治疗则主要取决于患者的血压水平，临床上将血压水平划分为5个等级（详见表 1），从有氧运动引起血压下降的幅度来看，血压处于正常高值范围内的患者从有氧运动中的获益最为明显，规律的有氧运动能够使其血压恢复为正常血压；1级高血压患者在保持良好生活习惯的基础上有可能通过单纯的有氧运动将血压降低至正常范围内；对于2级高血压患者来说，有氧运动则可以作为辅助治疗手段，通过规律的有氧运动可以达到减少服药剂量的目的；而3级高血压患者在有氧运动中通常会面临较高的运动风险，因此不建议在缺少医务监督的情况下单独进行有氧运动。\n表 1：血压水平分级\n什么样的有氧运动能够有效降低血压？\n运动引起的血压降低是有严格触发条件的，并不是“微微出汗”就能达到降低血压的目的。有氧运动由运动周期、运动频率、运动时间、运动强度等几个基本要素组成，持续8周以上、每周3次以上、每次持续20分钟以上的中等强度有氧运动是能够有效降低血压的最低运动标准，以上要素中的任何一个达不到要求都很难使血压降低。\n在以上的要素中，运动强度是影响降压效果最为关键，也是最难把控的一个要素，中等及以上的运动强度才能够引起血压的有效降低。运动强度常用最大心率的百分比来界定，如果有可以监测实时心率的手环或手表，在运动中心率达到最大心率的70%即可视为中等强度，最大心率可以通过“220-年龄”来估算。例如，一位30岁的青年人，他的最大心率约为220-30=190，190×70%≈133，当他在运动中的心率达到每分钟133次以上时即可…",

          "description": "这是一张我一直珍藏在手机里的照片，2017 年，少数派很荣幸的被邀请到美国现场参见 WWDC 大会，并参与了 Apple 设计奖的颁奖和报道，作为一个名不见经传的小媒体来说确实难得，也算是对我们前五年坚持推荐优质付费应用的一个小小认可。\n\n从这一年开始，一张图看懂 WWDC 就成了我们的招牌菜，用最简洁、最漂亮的设计，诠释大会关键信息，别小看这一张图，都是在半夜三点到六点之间做完的，通常都要两三个同事一起熬通宵，我虽然不参与设计，也会尽量陪着，做一些社交传播工作。\n也就是这一次，我才了解到苹果设计奖的一些标准关键词：Usability（易用性）、Design（设计）、Innovation （创新），Technology（技术应用）。而我们在 2014 年，就基于用户的角度，总结了少数派报道和推荐产品的四个标准关键词：「原创，优美，实用，有趣」，并把它们标注在网站的页脚。\n\n我没想到两个标准会有这么高的重合度，虽然看起来非常的巧合，但实际上，这是平台方希望保持「用户角度」的相同初心。这几个字说起来简单，但面对商业世界就非常的不容易。因为要坚持这样的推荐报道原则，我们放弃了很多广告投放的机会，商业化进展缓慢，终于在用完第一笔投资之后，进入严重的经营困难，不得不大幅收缩团队，转型拓展。而这个痛苦阶段，就在我们第一次受邀参加 WWDC 大会的一个月之后。\n现实就是如此，台前的辉煌不一定被看到，但幕后的痛苦你一个也躲不掉。\n\n从 2017 到 2019 年，少数派连续三次被邀请到美国现场报道 WWDC，随着经验丰富，我们也做了更多的准备。2019 年现场采访了很多开发者，录制了一些现场视频，那一年，我们刚刚建立视频内容小组，开始拓展一些新的形式。虽然拍摄和剪辑比较稚嫩，但内容还算是干货满满。\n随后两年，疫情来了，WWDC 也都改成了线上录播，虽然缺少了线下的仪式感，但我们还是保持着熬夜报道和制作一图流的习惯。对于我这个四十出头的中年人来说，熬一次夜还是挺伤身的，但这既是工作，也是爱好，痛并快乐着。\n近两年，随着智能手机销量的下降，国产品牌的追赶，WWDC 的关注度似乎也在减退，因为用户希望看到更多惊喜，而现实是硬件和应用创新都进入了瓶颈期。这次 WWDC 2022，苹果生态的价值开始被展现出来，四个大的 OS 都基本完善了，开始进行相互打通，比如 iPhone 和 Mac 电脑的相机协同，比如 macOS 的台前调度被整合到 iPadOS，还有深度调用车机信息的全新 CarPlay，这里不是简单的把设备捏在一块，而是基于用户的场景需求，提供最佳的组合方案，多年构建的生态壁垒又一次拉开了苹果与其他对手的距离。\n但回想一下，苹果这个生态是怎么来的呢？首先你不能跟风，而是要站在用户的角度，去做未来的布局；其次你不能贪婪，要放弃短期利益，去构建长期的用户信任；最后你不能偷懒，要保证每一个产品和服务的体验，不断累加产品力。除了这些基础的工作，还要应对开发者关系、投资者收益、供应链管理等一系列的考验，所以具有壁垒的生态不是喊出来的，是一步一步做出来的。\n\n一转眼，五年又过去了，很庆幸少数派还在，并且建立了基础的商业闭环，而苹果已经成为了全球最具价值的公司，我们也又一次参与了 WWDC 和苹果设计奖的采访报道。这五年里，很多外部事物都变了，但更多底层的东西并没有变。",

          "description": "为什么要这么做？\n昨天在推上看到一个视频，注意到他是使用 Sony ZV1 作为直播摄像头的。而作为一个视频制作者，我的不少视频都是以真人 + 教程的形式提供给我的观众的，我突然想起来，或许我可以使用手机来作为摄像头来完成视频的录制。\n和 MBP 自带的摄像头相比，可以让我在视频中更加清晰、更加明亮，让我的视频的观众们可以更好的看到我（没错，就是这么自恋）。于是，我决定用我的备用机 — Pixel 6 来完成这个操作。\n为什么是 Iriun Webcam\nIriun Webcam 的一个好处是免费版可以使用 4K，且免费版的水印也十分的不明显，对于白嫖用户十分友好。如果你需要完全去除水印或更加强大的控制能力，则可以付费获得。不过对于绝大多数场景，免费版足矣。\n所需软件\n\nmacOS 驱动下载：https://iriun.com/\nAndroid Play Store 应用：https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacksoftw.webcam\niOS App Store 应用：https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iriun-webcam-for-pc-and-mac/id1439303579?mt=8\n\n所需硬件\n\n与手机适配的 USB 数据线：如果本地网络速度足够快，也可以不使用数据线。不过我推荐你使用 USB 数据线，主要是理论上会更加的稳定。\n\n操作流程\n安装软件\nPC 端\n想要实现软件连接，需要先下载安装相应的软件。Iriun Webcam 支持 WIndows 、 macOS 和 Ubuntu ，你只需要访问其官网，并下载对应的软件，并在本地进行安装即可\n\n手机端\n手机端则可以在你的手机上搜索 Irirun webcam，并进行安装。\n\n配置设备连接\n安装完成后，在 macOS 上打开 Iriun Webcam 会看到如下的界面，此时说明你的 PC 已经准备好了。\n\n未连接状态的效果\n在手机上打开同样的软件，稍等片刻，二者就会自动连接到一起\n\n已连接状态的效果\n换用 USB 连接\n使用 Wi-Fi 连接的最大的问题是不稳定，以及延迟高。因此，你可以选择改用 USB 数据线进行连接，从而获得一个更低的延迟和更稳定的视频效果。\n你需要先将自己的手机开启开发者选项，并开启「USB 调试」，随后将手机与电脑连接（如果有授权窗口，则授权 PC 进行调试）。\n\n授权完成后，稍等片刻软件就会自动刷新，手机后的「Wi-Fi」变为「USB」，则说明你已经成功切换为使用 USB 连接。\n\n配置软件摄像头\n当你配置完成 Iriun 的 Webcam 之后，就可以在你日常使用的软件当中切换具体使用的摄像头为 Iriun Webcam 来获得从手机取得的视频画面。\n\n腾讯会议的摄像头选择框\n如果你使用 OBS 的话，还可以将音频输入修改为 Iriun Webcam audio （腾讯会议并不支持），来获取手机当中传递过来的音频信号。\n\n总结\n使用手机摄像头来替代 Mac Book Pro 上自带的摄像头可以帮助我们获得一个更好的画质和视频观看体验。相比于购买一个全新的摄像头，不妨用上你的旧手机来完成你的直播诉求。而你所需要的，不过是一款免费软件 + 一根 USB 数据线。",

Kindle 停止运行的重要时间节点\nKindle 对于我们的影响主要是在两个时间点：2023 年 6 月 23 日和 2024 年 6 月 40 日。\n\n在 2023 年的 6 月 23 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 商店当中购买我们喜欢的图书（还有一年时间缓冲）。\n在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 当中下载我们已经购买好的图书。\n在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日之后，我们只能通过 Kindle 数据线连接电脑的方式来下载图书到 Kindle 当中阅读。\n\n所以从短期来看，我们依然可以继续使用 Kindle 愉快的读书而没有丝毫的影响。但长期来看，如果你更喜欢线上随时选购的方案，那迁移到其他平台是必然的选择。\n2.

          "description": "HansZimmer: \n苹果现在自研芯片打通了自家产品线后，刀法也越来越准了，看起来需求明确的话，选择产品会很容易，实际情况是不是这样？\niPhone 产品线\n需要高刷，高性能，高拍照需求的选 Pro ，但需要忍受更大的手机重量\niPad Pro 产品线\n同样需要高刷，高存储容量，高显示（ 12.9 mini LED ）的用户，可以选 Pro 系列，但价格很贵，基本可以摸到 MacBook Pro 14/16 这个产品线\nMacBook 产品线\n高性能用户选择 MacBook Pro ，代价就是重量更重，价格也贵很多\nMacBook Air 系列，现在更轻，显示更好，也更薄，定位很好，希望可以有个 12 寸或者更大的版本出来\n今年的 13 寸 MacBook Pro 感觉是个清库存的货色。。不太建议买\niMac 产品线\n目前只有 24.5 寸的版本，希望可以扩展 27 甚至 32 版本的普通版\n然后 iMac Pro 系列可以出高刷和 mini LED 版本的\nMac mini 和 Studio 系列\n目前 Studio 对于普通用户来说有点过于强大\n希望 M2 版本的 mac mini 可以缩小体积，并且增加 SD 卡槽\n其他的就不多展开了，苹果自家的显示器回归，特别是“平民款”的产品，是一个好事情。\n我觉得苹果策略是让普通用户或者专业用户从买一个凑合应对所有场景，到各个场景可以选择不同产品，达到卖更多和圈钱更多的目的。",

That's when I opt for Groovy.\nIn a recent article, I reviewed some of the differences between creating and initializing maps in Groovy and doing the same thing in Java. In brief, Groovy has a concise syntax for setting up maps and accessing map entries compared to the effort necessary in Java.\nThis article will delve into more differences in map handling between Groovy and Java.

          "description": "“Instantly” is only a slight exaggeration.\n    \n\n  \nCapcom has launched a demo of Resident Evil Village that’s powered by Google’s Stadia cloud gaming tech, letting people test out the horror game in a browser. In a press release, Google says that the idea is to let people try out the game, no matter what device they own. The game and its demo were already available for Stadia subscribers, but now anyone can try it out for free, provided they have a supported web browser and an internet connection faster than 10 megabits a second. You don’t even need a Google account; you just navigate to the website, enter your birthday (the game’s rated M), and click the play button.\nAs for how the demo looks... you certainly get what you pay for with the browser version.

The carrier stealthily discontinued its top-tier Unlimited Elite plan for new subscribers this week, and added a new one that doesn’t include HBO Max anymore, as reported by Next TV (via FierceWireless).\nThe new top plan is called Unlimited Premium, which comes in at the same $85 a month for a single line.
