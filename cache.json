It's just a giant skill to acquire. \nBut as you learn, you start to recognize all the different gradations of learning. So this one big thing is actually a bunch of skills, and there are levels of each of them.\nAnd the more you learn about, say, backend development, the more you realize there are other areas you don't understand, like not just frontend, but networking programming, phone development, OS development, and writing firmware. Every little area is fractal with so much knowledge in it.\nPart of learning is just learning how much you don't know, so it makes sense that \"dumb people don't know how dumb they are\" because knowing how dumb you are is something you have to learn. \nWhat do you think?",

We have some roles that can access a particular page.\nThese valid roles are defined in an array.\nconst roles = ['moderator', 'administrator', 'superman'];\n\nHow can we check to see if a user's role is part of this list?\nFor the sake of this article, we'll assume the user's role is a simple string like so:\ncost role = 'user';\n\nThere are a couple of options for us here. Let's take a look at each of them.\nThis might be my personal most used option. It's quick and straightforward and has no weird overhead.\nThis includes method will return true or false if it can find the string you are looking for.\nroles.includes('user');\n// false\n\nroles.includes('moderator');\n// true\n\nWe can also use indexOf, which will return -1 if it can't find the item or the actual index if it does.\nroles.indexOf('user');\n// -1\n\nroles.indexOf('superman');\n// 2\n\nThis could be super helpful if you need the item's index anyway, but I think includes should work better for you if you don't.\nAnother way of doing this is using the some method, this will return a boolean like the includes method.\nIt will return if some of the items in the array match the search query.\nroles.some((role) => role === 'user');\n// false\n\nroles.some((role) => role === 'moderator');\n// true\n\nAgain, depending on the use-case, this could be the better solution, mainly good if you would have to check for multiple things to match.\nThe find method is a new way of searching an array, and it will return undefined or the item.\nroles.find((role) => role === 'user');\n// undefined\n\nroles.find((role) => role === 'moderator');\n// 'moderator'\n\nThis method is perfect if you need the entire object to do something with.\nAnd there you go, multiple ways of checking if an array contains a value.\nYou can try all of these out in the following CodePen (Note: Open your terminal)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Thank you for reading, and let's connect!\n\n\nThank you for reading my blog.

Pandas is said to be derived from the term \"panel data,\" and it stands for Python Data Analysis Library in full.\nThe package supports SQL, Excel (.xmls), and JSON files in addition to.csv files. As a result, there is no need to bother with converting files to csv format. Pandas' ability to re-arrange data into appealing rows and columns is a fascinating feature!\nLet’s get started\n\n\nYou must have the anaconda application installed on your PC in order to install pandas. Alternatively,Google Notebook. You may access Jupyter Notebook by typing the keywords Jupyter Notebook into your search bar after installing anaconda. On your machine…",

Also, why do any of these things matter?\nThe web has evolved a lot over the years, and the applications of it today are almost unrecognizable from its most early days. The evolution of the web is often partitioned into three separate stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.\n\nWeb 1.0 was the first iteration of the web. Most participants were consumers of content, and the creators were typically developers who build websites that contained information served up mainly in text or image format. \nThe next iteration of the internet was called the “web 2.0” or the “read-write” web. Now, users were not just idle visitors, they could create their own content and upload it to a website. It could support near real-time interactions…",

These platforms often have the pre-built templates, drag-and-drop functionality to design UI, and integrations with  databases, so they can ultimately be deployed as your own mobile or web app.\nThere are many no-code app builders on the market, and it can be hard to find the best option, especially because you can often only see a landing page, marketing information, and exciting slogans. \nSerhii Pospielov, AI Practice Head at Exadel, reviewed several no-code app builders from a developer's point of view. He tried to create MVPs on 13 different platforms, but only managed to achieve that on five (this doesn’t mean that the other eight aren’t good platforms – just that they didn’t meet his particular business need).  Serhii’s favorite no-code app builders were: \nAppery.io, \nAppGyver, \nCheck out his Best No-Code App Builders (Part 1) on Medium and see the other top platforms in his list along with their screenshots of interfaces. \nYou’ll also find concrete information about the difference between no-code and low-code mobile app builders, the role of back end on a mobile application, the key stages in developing a mobile app, and more things to consider when evaluating the costs of no-code app builders.",

          "description": "JavaScript list of operators containing question marks might surprise new developers approaching the language for the first time. \nnullish coalescing operator (??) works. \nFollowing MDN definition, \"The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy\".\ncondition ? expression1 : expression2\n\nYou can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. \nThis is not entirely accurate but before diving into truthy and falsy let's see an example with a condition that can only be true or false.\nlet condition = true;\nconsole.log(condition ? 'exp 1' : 'exp 2'); // exp 1\n\nSince we defined a variable called condition as true, the ternary operator executes the first expression which is a simple string \"exp 1\". \nThe console.log() around the ternary operator logs the result of the ternary operator and it logs \"exp 1\".\nAs I said above, you can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. But this is not entirely accurate!\nSo, what is the problem?\nWhen talking about Javascript Ternary Operator, MDN talks about truthy and falsy instead of true and false.\ncondition ? expression1 : expression2\n\nIF the condition is truthy execute expression1 else (falsy) execute expression2.\nIn simple terms, \nTruthy values are equal or can be converted to true. Which values are truthy? All values unless they are defined as falsy. Thanks…\nFalsy values are equal or can be converted to false.

Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.\nSample code showing a simple Set object usage:\nfunction main() {\n\n    const gameScreen = document.getElementById('game-screen')\n    gameScreen.addEventListener('click' updateAction)\n\n    const cursorPositions = new Set()\n    function updateAction(event) {\n      let position = {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}\n      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case\n    }\n    // use unique cursorPositions below\n}\n\nwhile(true) {\n  main()\n}\n\nDuplicate values are discarded when added to a set.

It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.\nAnyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that's the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.\nWell then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for \"production\"). \nHopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).\nI don't think it's necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn. So now the next step is to take this experience and continue the journey. It's still just the beginning.",

It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. \nOne of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. \nSvelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework.

A blockchain is a publicly available and distributed database, which acts as the memory of the EVM. One role of this memory is acting as a ledger, saying who owns how much Ether, the cryptocurrency supported by the Ethereum network.

It's about showing up, doing your best and not giving up. Regularly.\nIt's the same for your brain. If you are learning a new framework, a new programming language, or working on a side project to expand your skills, you are much better off doing a small amount every day, or several times a week, as opposed to bingeing.

I originally joined the DEV Team in June of 2019 as a Business Development and Growth Intern. Although I had been an intern for some time, my colleagues have always respected me as a significant part of the team through-and-through. \nTwo-and-a-half years later, I graduated from The College of New Jersey with my Bachelor's in English. Now, I'm becoming a part of the DEV Team full-time as a Developer Marketing Associate! It's a really exciting change and I'm looking forward to every part of it. \nBetween work and school, I have not had a lot of time to improve my programming skills and engage with the community on a personal level. I hope to change this over the course of the next few months. I'm certain you will all be seeing more of me as I tackle this new position. Wish me luck!\nIf you have any questions or comments — or just want to chat — don't hesitate to reach out!

          "description": "一年又一年，Apple 在今天发布了由 iPhone 13 Pro 拍摄的虎年新春影片《卷土重来》，这部影片是 Apple 发布的第五支新春影片，也是与过去四部影片完全不同的一部作品。\n\n首先是时长，《卷土重来》的片长有 23 分钟之久，与之相比，2018 年发布的首支 Apple 新春影片《三分钟》的片长为 7 分钟、去年发布的《阿年》为 12 分钟。其次是类型元素，与过去人物关系、道具场景都相对简单的四部影片不同，我们在《卷土重来》中可以看到传统武打、好莱坞科幻、乡土情怀、幽默喜剧、父子亲情等多种电影风格类型，道具和场景方面包含了机器人和机器狗、全地形车、火星基地、飞船模型等等，制作规模进一步突破。\n《卷土重来》讲述的是电影梦碎的儿子，跟一个异想天开的父亲，为了把无人问津的村子打造成网红景点，率领一众村民拍摄火星大电影的故事。身为替身武打演员的儿子，在一次拍摄中不慎受伤之后无奈回村，接受了电影梦破灭现实的他，希望利用多年积攒下来的积蓄，将父亲接去城市生活，告别土地贫瘠、生活环境恶劣的乡村。父亲则希望为乡村拍摄一部影片，希望通过这部影片将乡村走出困境，同时也帮助儿子圆一次电影梦。\n影片从父子之间的矛盾作为展开，儿子希望带领父亲逃离「除了沙尘一无所有，荒凉得跟个火星似的」乡村，前往城市生活；父亲则从儿子的话语中收获了不一样的理解：那就拍一部关于「火星」的电影。这里展现的，不仅是现实中父母与子女常有的矛盾冲突，也代表了两代人对于困难、梦想的不一样的看法：20 岁的儿子虽然怀揣电影梦，但是遇到困难就决定接受现实、放弃梦想；60 岁的父亲却对梦想执着追求，不仅希望帮助儿子圆一次电影梦，也对于生活了一辈子的乡村仍抱有希望，对于村民抱有希望。\n\n影片背后留下的不少线索，也埋藏了对于现代生活的各种还原。比如父亲希望拍摄视频放到网上，将村子打造成网红景点，正是当下短视频时代的一种社会缩影…",

          "description": "先说结论：\n目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。\n\n\n正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。\n事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。\n无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。\n针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。\n他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。\n这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。\n除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 \n简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。\n\n\n但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。\n所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。\n但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。\nSAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: \n\n当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。\n因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。\n驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…\n而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…\n双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。\n\n\n更多的的讨论可以关注我之前的一些回答：\n南京一特斯拉司机早高峰开自动驾驶脱把睡觉，这一行为违法吗？如何看待目前的「自动驾驶」技术？\nL5 真的能实现吗？或者说，未来无人驾驶真的会成为常态吗？\n如果未来交通工具都是自动驾驶，你能做到安心出行吗？\n复旦教授杨珉公开质疑理想汽车「自动驾驶安全性没有想象的那么香，事关人命」，目前阶段的自动驾驶靠谱吗？\n\n\n以及这个视频：\n【德国博士】完全无人驾驶有可能实现么？L5安全性悖论及未来智慧城市出行的展望\n\n参考文献\n\nhttps://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/self-driving-car-statistics/\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety\n\n\n留德华叫兽\n点击下载\n86 个回答，查看全部。\n喝了酒以后，让特斯拉自动驾驶，算酒驾吗？\n美国的联邦法律是如何产生的？",

          "description": "将汽车轮胎按照地区分类，大致可以分为欧洲、北美、日韩、东南亚、中国。轮胎和所在地汽车工业息息相关，甚至间接决定了品牌定位。\n典型如韩国，韩国汽车产品定位亲民家用，韩泰、锦湖也比较注重这方面。日本和美国是汽车老牌大国，两国汽车市场高度捆绑，所以两国轮胎品牌也主要以经济和越野为主。中国和东南亚地区的轮胎品牌，也都根据当地的汽车企业定位，诞生了比如玛吉斯、佳通、朝阳、玲珑等主要轮胎品牌。\n欧洲有些不同的是，作为汽车的发源地，大量的运动赛事和跑车、豪华、家用、经济型汽车的全方位涉足，使得欧洲诞生了诸多性能顶级、品类全面的轮胎品牌，包括大家耳熟能详的德国马牌、米其林和倍耐力等。\n\n\n选择合适的轮胎前，先搞清楚需求。\n大多数轮胎品牌都有从上到下全面的布局，有经济、豪华、舒适、性能等各个系列，所以如果不是完全家用、经济趋向的车型，售价在15万以上，对操控、静音有些要求时就可以重点考虑欧洲品牌了。\n问题是，一款轮胎不可能方方面面做到尽善尽美，如果有，那就是方方面面都不是最好。\n如果在意成本，应该侧重考虑耐磨，但是耐磨一定程度上会影响舒适性和操控性，噪音也会增加。对于一些非入门车型来说有些得不偿失。出租车一般会倾向选择耐磨轮胎。\n如果在意性能，比如领克03+、高尔夫GTI、宝马240i这一类的车子，需要重点考虑抓地力。抓地力好的轮胎可以有效提升车辆极限，相应的耐磨会变差。如果为了迁就耐磨，整车性能得不到发挥，事实上会造成更大的浪费。\n\n\n如果是商务出行，比如别克GL8、奔驰V一类的车型，需要重点考虑舒适性。\n如果是新能源车型或者豪华轿车，由于先天出色的静谧性或者对静谧性的高要求，应该侧重静谧性选择轮胎，以获得更加安静的乘坐感受。\n有了需求就可以按图索骥选择产品了。多数汽车品牌有明确的系列划分，要理解一点都不困难，比如德国马牌旗下一共有三个大类：全能、运动和越野，命名规则是Conti-XXXX…",

          "description": "何为黑色电影之黑\n法国影评人定义了黑色电影，他们从四十年代美国电影中归纳出这种风格。到五十年代末，奥逊·威尔斯执导的[历劫佳人]宣告了经典黑色电影时期的终结，随之而来的是所谓的新黑色电影——彩色取代黑白、黑色元素和主题融入某个类型化叙事中——犯罪、惊悚、科幻、恐怖等。黑色电影概念包含了一系列视觉和影像风格以及特定的主题——犯罪和荒诞。所谓黑色，既强调视觉，也强调叙事和主题。\n\n从社会性源起来说，黑色电影是对二三十年代约翰·福特、弗兰克·卡普拉等导演所信奉的美国中产社会价值的反叛。底层、中产阶级、警察、女人等，或是陷入腐化堕落的罪恶环境，或是走向犯罪深渊。黑色电影虽然鲜少直接谈论宏大的政治、社会问题，但它们或多或少从这些问题中，产生了创作的冲动和灵感。源自人性的贪婪和腐败是导致主角犯罪或堕落的根本原因。\n回看美国经典黑色电影，“黑色”之意并不难领略。它们大多是讲犯罪故事，或是与人性的阴暗面有关，让人感到既危险又迷人。主角只是普通人，而非穷凶极恶的帮派人物，或是被逼无奈的反抗者。\n一般来说，1941年的[马耳他之鹰]在好莱坞刮起了黑色电影之风。从类型上来看，它是一部侦探电影，但具备了与该类型电影不同的黑色主题——不是聚焦于一般意义上的犯罪或悬疑解密，而是透过侦探之手，发现罪恶背后，道德和人性的失衡。\n\n当侦探、女主和犯罪团伙的老大围在传说中用金子制作的马耳他之鹰周围时，他们的目光聚集了贪欲，但影片在此又狠狠黑色了一把：众人搭上几条性命，互相欺骗和斗争而争夺回来的宝物，却是一文不值的东西。\n这种历经千帆后，被宿命击中的荒诞，亦是黑色电影迷人的地方。与女主暧昧的侦探，最终向警察告发了她的罪行。这是早期黑色电影的“保守”之处(因为海斯法典，好莱坞当时对性、变态、犯罪、暴力的表现还有很多禁忌)，摇摆的道德最后要回到正轨，作恶者自食其果。\n在[双重赔偿][失去的周末]和[日落大道]里，导…",

          "description": "去年当爹了，说实话哪怕1个孩子，我都觉得自己的轿车空间有些捉襟见肘。带娃家庭对于空间的需求提升，远不止一个座位+儿童安全座椅那么简单，而是伴娃左右的各种杂七杂八，都得有地方妥妥安置。\n我就想，以后三胎家庭越来越多，要应付3个孩子的日常出行，这样的SUV有吗？于是我罗列了大家庭SUV的实用条件：\n\n绝对空间一定要够；\n相对空间，也就是内部灵活性必须有，能让车主自己组合布局；\n人性化设计，包括按键布局、随手就能利用的储物格等等，很考验厂商的用户思维；\n在满足以上三点的基础上，车辆的智能化也可以为出行提供便利，这项并非强求。\n\n\n离家不远就有很多4S店，带着这些需求，我“假模假式”探访了一波，结果被一款即将上市的新车按住了，它就是一汽－大众旗舰SUV——揽境。这款车指导价为29.99~39.99万元，不到30万就能入手的德系大块头，值得细细品味！\n\n而且我发现，这次一汽-大众为揽境邀请的品牌代言人于和伟，从某种程度上讲与车辆的定位十分契合。于和伟属于可塑性很高的演技派，从《大宅门》里吐口水的白占安，到《新三国》里“接着奏乐接着舞”的刘备，戏路实在是广。反过来看，揽境是定位于大家庭兼商务的全能旗舰SUV，于和伟站在揽境旁边，显然可以突出后者的全能属性——力图满足客户所有用车场景。\n\n绝对空间 | 随便折腾！\n\n这家店有两台揽境，一台作为展车摆在显眼的位置，另一台即将办好上路手续。一汽-大众的店员很热情，把车洗好了让我独自享受！时间有限，我马上按照大家庭SUV的使用条件，一项一项“折腾”起来。\n一汽-大众揽境 前两排空间展示\n首先是前排空间，调整好坐姿后，身高1.68米的我头部距离车顶尚有两拳距离。这是在我意料之中的，因为揽境的车身高度接近1.8米，对于身高1.9米以下的人来说都是完全够用的。\n\n保持驾驶位座椅不变，来到第二排。揽境采用2+2+2的6座布局形式，且全系可以选装7座。这…",

          "description": "《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。\n我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。\n音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。\n\n\n关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n妖刀王\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\nCOMIC LO杂志前一百期有哪些经典内容？\n如何制作一张好的学术海报（poster）？",

          "description": "前言\n最近用 Adobe Illustrator 绘制了一大堆图标，操作基本都保持右手握鼠标、左手小拇指以 Ctrl 为圆心在键盘上活动的状态。在绘制过程中左手常常需要按下大量的快捷键，为了提高效率，我把快捷键设定在了键盘最上面一排的功能键上。而实际用起来，从 F5 键向右，操作逐渐又不方便起来了。\n我开始想象：如果有一个小的键盘可以放在左手旁边、每个按键都能映射为不同的快捷键就好了。这个理想中的键盘需要满足这几点：\n\n可自定义按键功能，实现快捷操作；\n体积小，按键尽可能多；\n造型简洁，最好是无线；\n可以根据当前软件自动切换按键功能（加分项）\n\n根据以上要求，很快我就搜到了这次的主角：微软蓝牙数字键盘。\n功能简介\n技术规格\n微软蓝牙数字键盘的键位与普通键盘的数字区基本一致。通过蓝牙与电脑配对成功后，左上角的按键可以快速打开计算器进行计算。另外，它可以同时与3台设备配对，通过背面的按钮进行切换。\n安装键盘配套应用的「微软鼠标和键盘中心」后，18个按键中，有17个都可以自行设置功能（计算器键只能打开计算器或充当 NumLock 键）。通过 basic settings 可以设置全局按键功能，在 app-specific settings 中可以为不同应用单独设置按键功能，从而实现切换应用时自动切换案件配置方案。\n应用中可选择的众多预设功能列表\n在「微软鼠标和键盘中心」中提供了众多预设功能，利用列表的最后隐蔽着的 Key Combination 和 Macro 设置自定义快捷键、录制宏，则是让这个键盘成为真正的效率神器的关键。\n使用体验\n以 Adobe Illustrator 为例，它的快捷键组合非常多，其中不乏要按下 Alt Shift Ctrl 的同时按下一个字母键的，难以单手操作；想要为常用的一些操作设置快捷键时，不仅要考虑能否轻松地单手按下，又要避免与现有的快捷键重复。使用微软蓝牙数字键盘设置快捷键可以不用考虑能否单手操作的问题，即便远在键盘两端的 Shift + Ctrl + 9 也可以通过指定的一个按键完成操作。\n我将使用频率较高的快捷键映射到这个键盘，又为一些原本没有快捷键的高频操作设置了新的快捷键。如下图将快捷键设置好之后，绘制图形的效率显著提高。例如原本需要 Ctrl + C、Shift + Ctrl + V 两步操作的「就地粘贴」操作，现在只需要按下「.」键即可完成。\n我设置的按键功能与对应快捷键\n上图中大部分是通过 Key Combination 设置直接输入对应快捷键，「就地复制」的功能是通过 Macro 设置实现。值得一提的是，你还可以在 Macro 设置中输入鼠标按键和鼠标位移。\nKey Combination 的设置界面Macro 的设置界面\n总结\n微软蓝牙数字键盘外观小巧简洁；功能上不仅能满足日常办公、媒体控制这些基本操作，也可以在图片处理、视频剪辑等场景下提高效率，甚至用来玩游戏、演示幻灯片……只要根据你的使用场景进行设置，这样一个特别的小键盘也一定可以成为你的效率神器。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n扫码分享",

          "description": "为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。\n我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。\n为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。\n短信转发至 iPhone 效果\n在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App\n🔗 下载地址：App Store\nBark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 > Bark 服务端 > 苹果 APNs 服务器 > 你的设备 > Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。\n第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。\nBark App\n在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder\n🔗 下载地址：酷安\nSmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。\n打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。\n将Bark设置为发送通道\n返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。\n设置短信转发规则\n除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。\n为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️\n出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。\n示例：realme UI 后台权限设置\n出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。\nrealme UI 验证码安全保护\n将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac\n根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。\n总结\n得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。\n如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n扫码分享",

          "description": "(Read this article on the blog)\nDelaying\nLambda is event-driven, meaning it starts running when an event triggers it. Because of this, it does not support delaying that event and start processing at a\nlater time.\nWhile it could wait as part of its code, that is an expensive operation as you need to pay for the total runtime of the function multiplied by the memory\nallocation. Also, the maximum time a function can run is 15 minutes. In theory, you could use a small Lambda for waiting and call itself to extend the hard\nexecution limit, it is more of an interesting development challenge than a realistic approach.\nIn AWS, you can use Step Functions to solve this instead. It is an orchestration service that allows you to define a workflow as a state machine and it can\nuse other services and bui…",
