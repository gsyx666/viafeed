Today I’ll be discussing the concept of SVMs (Support Vector Machine), a subset of Machine Learning used commonly for classification and regression analysis. First off, we must discuss how SVM works from a theoretical standpoint.\n\nThe three lines seen (H1, H2, and H3) are known as “Hyperplanes”, which divide our data into classes. To define a hyperplane, one must follow a simple procedure:\nDraw a line between the two classes such that the closest data point from each class (known as the support vector) are equidistant from the line. Thus, we have defined a Hyperplane.\nHowever, it soon becomes apparent that an infinite number of hyperplanes can be derived. The obvious question arises: “How do we determine which hyperplane to use?” The answer is, we use the hyperplane which…",

          "description": "Technology has grown much faster than everything else. All the technology is developed because of coding and programming.\nSo what's the difference between coding and programming. \nBecause computers do not understand human languages. Coding allows humans to communicate with the computer. Code instructs the computer which tasks to be performed and what things to do. Learning code also helps develop applications, websites AI tools and even Internet of Things(IOT) among others.\nCoding is a process of establishing a successful communication between a software program and the computer hardware. The compilers translate the program into assembly language. The coding process converts the assembly language to Binary Coded Signals.\nProgramming is an act of designing and developing a logical software solution to the problem statement. It involves designing and developing the algorithms, flowcharts, and implementing the solution using a programming language.\nProgramming is a complex task. Unlike coding, programming is carried out in Stages. Following are the stages of programming a software application.\nProblem Statement\nDesigning Algorithms and Flowcharts\nSoftware Development\nSoftware Documentation\nSoftware Maintenance \nCoding uses traditional code/program editing tools like notepad, notepad++, Eclipse, and so on.\nProgramming tools are not confined to only editing a program. It involves interoperability between different software applications via data connectors. A software web application might have to store and manipulate data in a database and many more.\nIf you have any questions about on \"Coding Vs Programming\", mention them in the comment section below.\nIf this was helpful give me a like 👍 or share this article 😊\nAlso check out my blogs https://melbite.com/",

          "description": "Have you ever tried to add an event listener to a group of html elements all at once? if you had, you may had probably done something like this:\nconst buttons = document.getElementsByTagName(\"button\");\n\nbuttons.forEach((item) => {\n  item.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n    console.log(\"click\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe problem with the above code is that, when you finally check your browser console, you are going to encounter an error. Why?\nThis is because we are treating our list of buttons as an array while it is not.\nIt may look like an array, but it is actually either an htmlCollection or a nodeList. Whenever you make use of methods that fetch multiple elements/nodes from the DOM, that method either returns an htmlCollection or a nodeList.\nMethods that returns an htmlCollection include: document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName()\nMethods that returns a nodeList include: document.querySelectorAll(), document.getElementsByName()\nIn order to fix this problem, all you need to do is convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array. This way you can make use of array methods on it, and also add your event listener.\nYou can use any method you prefer in order to convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array, but my favorite way of converting them into an array, is by making use of the spread operator.\nconst buttons = document.getElementsByTagName(\"button\");\nconst buttonsArray = [...buttons];\n\nbuttonsArray.forEach((item) => {\n  item.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n    console.log(\"click\");\n  });\n});\n\n\nNow when you go to your browser console, everything will work as it is supposed to.",

Often developers compare GraphQL to REST APIs and see the N+1 requests (or over-fetching) as an important reason to go for GraphQL. Let's put that to the test and explore if GraphQL APIs actually can outperform existing REST APIs. For this, we'll take a GraphQL-ized REST API and test the performance of GraphQL and compare it to the REST approach. For this we'll be using the popular performance testing tool k6.\nBefore exploring a GraphQL API, let's learn more about the technology. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, designed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012 to handle API requests on low bandwidth networks. After being used internally, GraphQL was open-sourced in 2015.

To generate and add it to GitHub, you need to follow following steps,\nThe SSH key can be generated using ssh-keygen command using git bash as below,\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nreplace your_email@example.com with your actual email address.\nBy default, the SSH key will be stored in the home directory.

Software development best practices have given rise to many platforms and tools to deploy software quickly and easily. Kubernetes and Helm can do so much together in helping developers deploy software with less effort. Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for running container-based apps in the enterprise. In fact, organizations aim at running all their production deployments on Kubernetes. \nThese are exciting times for those in the Kubernetes community because we’re seeing more and more users leverage its extended capabilities for even deeper operational insight and control.

The graphic recognition of elements of your applications (web, mobile, desktop) to make comparisons of graphic elements with each other.\nUntil now, detections and comparisons of application elements required capturing an element and its text attributes. To do this, you used the capture tool of Agilitest which allowed you to dig into the tree structure of your application and its data logic.\nNow, this capture tool has been expanded with a graphical capture possibility which \"photographs\" a small area of ​​the application in order to detect its occurrence during a test, once or several times.\nTo use the graphics recognition functionality, simply open the Agilitest capture tool and select a rectangular area. The blue selection rectangle allows you to choose the area to be captured, for later detection during a test.\nSelection of a graphic area in Agilitest\nOnce the image is selected, Agilitest allows you to copy or save the image for external use, but you can also drop the image directly in an Agilitest comment or access the tree of elements to generate an activatable zone...\nRead full article here.",

Web development and the task of creating the features and functionality of apps are closely related (web design).

So Algorithm is a major part of a software or application that defines all the business logic\nI started development in 2014. My first project was on Multi-Level Marketing binary Structure also called MLM Binary 1x2.\nThat was not easy for me to create the Tree logics that will generate dynamically.\n\nIt was hard for me to develop all the logic behind that tree with  lots of condition.\nIn 2014 there was no content on the Internet on how to build complex logic like MLM Binary 1x2. So I deeply did the experiments for almost 30 days. Then finally, I got a solution. I built that web application and provided it to the client. \nThe client was so happy because at that time there were very few developers who can do this. And the client ran the project for almost 2 years and earned a lot of money.\nSo after learning those complex logic, I was thinking other developers in the world facing the same issue. So I started a YouTube channel and told other developers how I build this.\nHere is the link - YouTube Channel\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  8 Years in developing Algorithms\n\n\nSo I did not stop here to create complex logic. Then I worked for many Software companies to build complex logic for them. I invested my 8 years to just creating logic. \nI think the journey in complex algorithm development will never end. Every day I learn new things and get more ideas. I still enjoy to develop Algorithms.\nCreating Algorithms is an Art",

          "description": "试试这个轻量级的开源工具，不用离开终端就可以预览文件。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n查看你的文件和文件夹的最基本方法是使用命令 ls 和 ll。但是有时候，我不仅想看到文件的元数据，还想一目了然地看到文件的内容。为此，我使用 ranger。\n\r\n如果你喜欢在控制台中工作，并使用 Vim 或 Vi，而且你不想因为任何原因离开你的终端，那么 ranger 就是你最好的新朋友。ranger 是一个精简的文件管理器，它不仅可以让你浏览文件，还可以预览它们。ranger 与 rifle 捆绑在一起，rifle 是一个文件执行器，可以有效地选择与特定文件类型相关的程序。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 ranger\n\r\nranger 可以在 Fedora 或任何基于 RPM 的发行版中安装，方法是运行：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install ranger\r\n\n\r\nranger 也可以用于 其他发行版和 macOS。\n\r\n第一次使用 ranger\n\r\n作为一个用户，你可以在你喜欢的终端上简单地输入 ranger 来启动 ranger。可以用方向键浏览。这张截图是一个很好的例子，我可以预览存储在 Kernel-tests 中的 config.example 文件的代码。\n\r\n\n\r\n选中任何文件并按下 F4 键，就可以打开你的默认编辑器，让你立即编辑这些文件！\n\r\n图像和视频怎么办？\n\r\n使用 rifle 和 ranger 可以让你快速找到与某一文件相关的程序。将鼠标悬停在图片上，然后试图打开它是非常简单的，只要点击回车即可。下面是它的样子：\n\r\n\n\r\n在一个图像文件上点击 i 会给用户提供所有的 EXIF 数据。点击 Shift+Enter 将打开这个 PDF 文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n同样的组合键将在系统默认的支持该编解码器的视频播放器中打开并开始播放视频。下面的例子是一个 mp4 视频，它在 VLC 上播放得很好。\n\r\n\n\r\n文件操作\n\r\n除非 Vim 用户另有配置，否则下面的键绑定工作良好。\n\r\n\r\nj：下移\n\r\nk：上移\n\r\nh: 移动到父目录\n\r\ngg：移到列表的顶部\n\r\ni：预览文件\n\r\nr：打开文件\n\r\nzh：查看隐藏文件\n\r\ncw：重命名当前文件\n\r\nyy：复制文件\n\r\ndd：剪切文件\n\r\npp：粘贴文件\n\r\nu：撤销\n\r\nz：改变设置\n\r\ndD：删除文件\n\r\n\r\n控制台命令\n\r\n有时我在起草文章时，有一个文件夹包含某个软件的截图。通过点击空格选择或标记文件，然后输入 :bulkrename，可以帮助我把所有奇怪的时间戳变成如：lorax1、lorax2 等等。下面是一个例子。\n\r\n\n\r\n其他有用的控制台命令包括：\n\r\n\r\npenwith：用你选择的程序打开一个选择的文件\n\r\n:touch FILENAME：创建一个文件\n\r\n:mkdir FILENAME：创建一个目录\n\r\n:shell <command>：在 shell 中运行一个命令\n\r\n:delete：删除文件\n\r\n\r\n在 tty2/3/4 中能工作吗？\n\r\n作为一个从事质量保证（QA）工作的人，我发现搜索日志和阅读日志从未如此简单。即使我的 Gnome 显示管理器崩溃了，我也可以切换到我的 tty2，用我的用户名和密码登录，并以超级用户权限启动 ranger，然后我就可以尽情地探索了！\n\r\nranger 是一个很好的工具，可以在不离开终端的情况下处理文件。ranger 是精简的，也是可定制的，所以不妨一试吧！\n\r\n图片来源：（Sumantro Mukherjee，CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/7/manage-files-linux-terminal-ranger\n\r\n作者：Sumantro Mukherjee 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "为何小小的单板机是智能工作以及小型办公室的未来。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n随着疫情的大流行，我们的工作方式也正在发生着改变。工作的分散化正在成为所有公司需要面临的一项重要挑战。\n\r\n智能办公室\n\r\n即使工厂认为智能办公仅仅是通过虚拟私有网络来对员工的笔记本电脑进行远程控制，再稍微增加一点进化也可以让一些基本的办公服务离人们更近一点，这些都能够极大降低数据中心的负载，并且提高人们的工作体验。这个方案还有一个额外的影响就是从信息和通信技术（ICT）上来说消除了许多单点故障。\n\r\n与其在公司外部有成百上千的工作场地，不如在世界范围内有着成百上千的小型办公室/分支，这就是所谓的“智能办公室”。\n\r\n这种表述可能会让许多 ICT 专家感到恐慌，因为这种文化使得每个办公室都与一台大机器（即服务器）联系在一起，即使分散计算资源的优势非常明显。\n\r\n一个不同的角度\n\r\n如果你能用一块 50 美元的小开发板提供一个大服务器的服务会怎么样？如果这个小板子只需要一张 SD 卡和一个普通的 USB 电源支持，那又会怎么样呢？这就是 树莓派 是最灵活的解决方案的原因所在。\n\r\n树莓派开发板是尺寸非常小的运行 Linux 的计算机。它有一个由树莓派基金会提供和维护的操作系统：树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。它基于 Debian，并与这个最知名的 Linux 发行版共享许多软件包。此外，许多树莓派的开发板能够完美运行最知名的 Ubuntu 服务器，它涵盖了 ARM 处理器支持，提供了对低功耗处理器的支持。\n\r\n但树莓派开发板对小公司来说也是一个很好的机会，以能够承担得起的代价获得大量的（开源）服务。但这种情况下，你必须考虑数据丢失的风险，因为你把所有的服务运行在一个小的、消费级的硬件上。不过设置正确的备份/恢复程序能够降低这些风险。\n\r\n你能从树莓派开发板上提供什么服务？\n\r\n大多数服务通常由更昂贵的服务器提供。这里的“大多数”取决于一些限制：\n\r\n\r\nARM 处理器： 一些软件包只支持 x86/x64 处理器。这是最难克服的挑战之一。但另一方面，ARM 处理器的市场份额不断增长，使得程序员为他们的软件开发了兼容 ARM 处理器的版本。\n\r\n内存容量： 这是一个仅限于在复杂应用以复杂的方式进行复杂的计算的情况下讨论的问题。很多时候，这只不过是关于重新审查代码、拆分步骤，并保持简单高效的问题。此外，如果一个服务虽然只服务少数几个用户，但需要大量的内存/CPU，这大概也意味着此服务没有正常工作。这可能是你消除浪费资源的旧问题的一个机会。最后，最新的树莓派开发板把内存容量升级到了 8GB，这是一个很大的提升。\n\r\n对服务器没有经验的用户： 这是另一个问题，你可以在基础镜像所在的树莓派的 micro-SD 卡中存储系统和运行数据。\n\r\n\r\n也就是说，你能够用树莓派做很多有趣的事情。在 我的博客 里，我通过运行各种服务进行了测试 —— 从基本的 LAMP 服务器到复杂的 CRM。从简单到复杂系统，全部都是开源的，例如：\n\r\n\r\n代理服务器（也能够添加广告拦截服务）\n\r\n电子邮件服务器\n\r\n打印服务器\n\r\n酒店管理\n\r\n联系关系管理（CRM）\n\r\n私人社交网络\n\r\n私人论坛\n\r\n私有 Git 门户网站\n\r\n网络监控服务器\n\r\n许多其他有用的服务\n\r\n\r\n对树莓派来说，另一个有趣的用法是在你的远程办公室获得提供高级服务的 Wi-Fi 热点，并且可以从它的以太网端口进行控制。\n\r\n最后，树莓派也能够运行容器，这是一个额外的工具，从这个不可思议的开发板中获得一个可用的服务世界。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/raspberry-pi-business\n\r\n作者：Giuseppe Cassibba 选题：lujun9972 译者：void-mori 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "前几天我试图安装 massCode 应用。对于安装，它提供了一个 Snap 文件以供下载。\n\r\n当我尝试从 Snap 文件安装应用程序时：\n\r\nsudo snap install snap_file\r\n\n\r\n它给了我以下错误：\n\r\nerror: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap \"masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap\"\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n这很奇怪。在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 时，你必须添加 GPG 密钥。但是这里的开发人员没有提供这样的东西。\n\r\n“修复”简单易行。让我给你解释一下。\n\r\n处理 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 错误\n\r\n这里其实不涉及签名。\n\r\n发生的情况是你从第三方下载了 Snap 安装程序。 Ubuntu 中的 Snap 机制希望你从官方 Snap 商店获取 Snap 包。\n\r\n由于它不是来自 Snap 商店，因此你会看到 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 的错误消息。与大多数错误消息一样，这个错误消息不是描述性的。\n\r\n那么，这里的解决方案是什么？\n\r\n任何未通过 Snap 商店分发的 Snap 包都必须使用 --dangerous 选项进行安装。这就是规则。\n\r\nsudo snap install --dangerous path_to_snap_file\r\n\n\r\n这样，你告诉 Snap 包管理器显式安装 Snap 包。\n\r\n在这里，我使用了这个选项并且能够成功地从它的 Snap 包中安装 massCode。\n\r\n\n\r\n以这种方式安装 Snap 包有多“危险”？几乎和下载并 安装 deb 格式安装包 相同。\n\r\n在我看来，如果你是从项目开发者的网站上下载 Snap 包，你已经在信任该项目了。在这种情况下，你可以使用 --dangerous 选项安装它。\n\r\n当然，你应该首先搜索该软件包是否在 Snap 商店中可用：\n\r\nsnap find package_name\r\n\n\r\n我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你修复 Snap 错误。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。如果你想了解更多信息，请参阅 这个使用 Snap 命令指南。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/snap-metadata-signature-error/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "俄罗斯的 Debian 衍生发行版的开发商计划上市\n\r\n来自俄罗斯的 Astra Linux 是 Debian 的下游发行版，它已经存在了一些年，除了 x86、Arm 等 CPU 架构外，它还支持 MIPS 架构。它是由 RusBITech 开发的，是专门为俄罗斯军队设计的。微软已经阻止了 Windows 在俄罗斯的使用，这似乎大大有助于推动替代操作系统的采用。路透社报道说，RosBITech 正计划在莫斯科证券交易所上市，估值约折合为 2.6 亿美元。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得他们比较谦虚，要是搞个根社区可能估值更高呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.26 有望使用 C++20 进行开发\n\r\n在即将到来的 KDE Plasma 5.26 桌面环境中，KDE 开发者正考虑使用 C++20 语言开发后续功能，尤其是使用 C++ 协同例程支持特性。随着时间的推移，这种较新的 C++ 语言也会用于其他 KDE 组件。将 C++ 要求提升到 C++20 意味着将 KDE 编译器要求提高到 GCC 10 或 Clang 11，而这些版本的编译器已经稳定发布两年了。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来最近各个开源项目都在逐渐迁移到新的语言标准和新的编译器了，这种稳健而进步的态度是开源的生命力。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nRISC-V 仅用 12 年达成百亿核心里程碑\n\r\n在近日召开的 Embedded World 大会上，RISC-V 国际的 CEO 宣布目前 RISC-V 市场上的核心数量已经突破 100 亿。CEO 认为开放标准是关键，“Linux 在为软件所做的事情，和我们为硬件所做的事情有异曲同工之妙。”RISC-V 是一种开放标准指令集架构（ISA），根据开源许可提供。据悉，ARM 架构经过 17 年，在 2008 年实现了这个里程碑。而 RISC-V 只用了 12 年就完成了这一目标。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：WCCF Tech\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来 RISC-V 真能复制 Linux 在软件方面的成功啊。",

          "description": "Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMeta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。\n\r\n现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。\n\r\n（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）\n\r\nMeta 试图不落下任何语言\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。\n\r\n虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。\n\r\n因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。\n\r\nNLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。\n\r\n正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！\n\r\n为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。\n\r\n你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。\n\r\n对社会事业的鼓励\n\r\nMeta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。\n\r\n项目的影响\n\r\n尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。\n\r\n许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。\n\r\n你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/meta-open-source-ai-model/\n\r\n作者：Rishabh Moharir 选题：lkxed 译者：fenglyulin 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "新款支持 Pluton 的 ThinkPad 默认不能安装 Linux\n\r\nPluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，不为他们所用的 Linux 不是好 Linux，而要为他们所用，可以是子系统、可以是虚拟机，对吧。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍\n\r\nCanonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：总算是又进一步改善了 Snap，虽然还有一些缺陷。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWeb3 项目今年前半年因黑客攻击损失超过 20 亿美元\n\r\n根据一项研究报告，Web3 领域仍然受到黑客、诈骗和网络钓鱼计划的困扰，同时还面临着相对较新的威胁，如闪电贷款攻击。在今年的前六个月，Web3 项目因黑客和漏洞而损失超过 20 亿美元，超过了去年全年。此外，研究还发现，Discord 是绝大多数网络钓鱼企图的载体，这是一个信号，表明它作为 Web3 的首选社交网络仍然很受欢迎，尽管安全问题不断。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Web3 虽然以积木式金融为创新，但是其最大的问题可能也来自于这种积木式结构。",

          "description": "作为小米冲击高端的第 3 年、第 4 个系列，12S 系列凭借着「徕卡影像」的亮点可谓赚足了眼球。我也第一时间到小米之家把玩了真机，虽然质感有进步，但整体的感觉依然很小米，硬件设计依然没有延续性可言，好在高通这代处理器终于把功耗拿捏住了（比去年 11 Ultra 明显发热卡住好太多了）。\n不过我今年依然不会选购小米旗舰，因为小米始终没有解决一个问题：R角设计。\n\n声明：我并没有相关的从业背景，所以并不清楚更专业且准确地描述这个问题，只能从普通消费者的角度形容这个问题。如有描述错误，请见谅。\n\nR 角设计是指什么？\nR角：R是圆角， Radius，指內圆弧角或外圆弧角。在手机硬件上看 R角设计的好坏时，我会把机身弧角、屏幕弧角放在一起看，因为这本质上就是把圆角放在其他圆角里。\n我们先来看看小米12S Ultra 的 R角设计：\n\n很明显，小米12S Ultra 的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率并不连续（有曲面屏的影响），也并非同心圆的关系，两个圆角曲率处有着奇怪的「畸形」。虽然这一代比小米11 Ultra 进步很多，但观感上依然别扭。\n\n而我眼中正确的 R 角设计，代表性的有苹果 iPhone 的全面屏机型、三星S22、谷歌 Pixel 5等，它们的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率连续，且处于同心圆的位置，看起来有秩序且耐看。苹果甚至还把这种「讲究」运用在了软件硬件的结合上，比如 iPhone 全面屏版本界面底部专属的 Dock 栏，以及 Dock 栏的图标与机身机身弧角、屏幕弧角完美呼应：\n真的让人感觉十分舒适。图/ carlosnuila\n值得一提的是，iPhone 12 系列回归直角边框设计后， 苹果还将该设备上运行的 iOS 版本进行了 R 角微调，即便它和  iPhone X、iPhone 11 系列都是运行同样的 iOS 系统，但机身硬件外观圆角曲率产生了变化，「执拗」的苹果就在软件上准备了两种完全不同的圆角曲率分别与不同机身外观进行更好地呼应。\n\nR 角设计做好，意味着什么？\n可能很多朋友会认为，R角的设计无关紧要，只是像我这类的人过于吹毛求疵。\n我尊重这个观点，因为多数设备的 R 角设计问题确实没那么重要。比如小米12S Ultra 这款机器整体表现出众，但它硬件设计缺乏的延续性、高端旗舰缺乏的精致感等问题，远比解决 R 角设计重要得多。\n但就我个人角度而言，手机是我每天接触最长的电子设备，而且这几年手机迭代升级提升有限，更换周期比以往慢了许多，所以我更在乎手机的外在形象和整体体验。\n手机在进入全面屏设计以后，我觉得是一个技术革命的开始，因为它让手机屏幕需要与边框之间的边界进一步缩小，达到一种近似融合的境界。\n图/giodp\n而优秀的 R 角设计，能让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，让屏幕与外壳间连接更趋向自然，让用户不能轻易感受到边界的存在，完全沉浸其中。反观设计不太好的 R 角，即便也有全面屏设计带来的震撼观感，但日常使用时也总能轻而易举感受到屏幕与外壳两者曲率处存在着奇怪的「畸形」，让技术革命带来的沉浸感始终不够彻底。\n让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，这一项看似简单的设计，背后也都蕴藏着大量的技术成本，比如 OLED 屏幕的切割和折叠、电路面板的堆叠技术、圆角处的次像素反走样渲染、严格的界面 UI 设计规范等等。\n最后，我很希望后续小米能够重视 R 角的设计，早日推出更棒的旗舰产品。因为我始终觉得，手机进入全面屏时代后，手机同质化越来越严重，最美的「风景」不是莱卡蔡司等相机品牌的联名、不是越来越窄的边框、不是越来越快的快充技术、不是越拍越远的长焦，而是来自 2017 年 iPhone X 那张让人完全沉浸其中的全面屏设计宣传图：\n让人舒适的R角设计",

          "description": "房车生活是许多人向往的事情，不过一辆优质的房车价格不菲，而且目前房车市场也不像家用车一样可以方便地试乘试驾，因为有全国连锁4S店的房车厂屈指可数。所以当你有迈入房车生活计划的时候，不妨先挑一个假期，先租上几天玩玩，看看房车的驾驶体验和使用体验你能否接受、房车中的诸多不便你能否克服、房车生活是否真的能给你带来更多快乐。\n那么最重要的问题来了：怎么租？\n一：可信的房车租赁平台\n首先是大家都很熟悉的携程，App首页里就有租车频道，很多热门旅游城市都有房车可以选择。​\n\n​\n \n\n​\n​​我没在携程租过房车，但在不同城市租过十几次其他车型，总体的服务是满意的，由于有携程平台的监管，租赁公司也不太敢玩套路，而且他们普遍很在乎你在携程的评价，会尽力服务好你，有一次我还车时车身有一条很细的划痕，车商让我给个好评就不用我赔偿了。\n但在下订单前最好浏览一下评论，如果差评很多可以换一家车商。\n在携程租车的另一个好处是免费取消时间、不同档次的保险费用和权益都会清晰标注，可以按需选择，比如对驾驶有信息，就买个基础险，小事故需要自己理赔；如果技术一般，或者去的地方路况比较差，可以购买全险，出任何大小事故都是由车商处理，很省心。\n类似的还有飞猪、马蜂窝等平台。\n第二个推荐是上汽大通集团的官方房车租赁平台。\n上汽大通是国内比较少见的汽车主机厂原厂改装房车的厂商，实力比大部分房车厂都雄厚。而它也有自己的房车租赁服务平台：“房车生活家租房车”小程序。\n\n​\n由于汽车主机厂自营的优势，可以利用其4S店网络进行服务，所以覆盖的城市比较多，而且所租的车型很齐全、车况好，甚至一些特色车型是外面平台租不到的。\n这个小程序还可以方便地找到房车营地，基本覆盖了全国主要的房车营地和小车露营地，对于上汽大通合作的营地还可以方便地查看水电、停车收费情况和环境、玩乐项目，非常有心。\n\n​\n二：其他平台​\n​如果你对自己的鉴别能力有信心，其实也可以尝试在万能的“闲鱼”寻找出租的房车，其实有很多规模很小的租车公司都会在闲鱼发布信息，价格会比在平台上便宜一点，覆盖的城市也更多。​\n​但一定要鉴别对方是否有合法的租赁手续，必要时让提供出示营业执照等信息，而且一定要签好合同。\n​\n\n​\n但​闲鱼的监管作用有限，不推荐没有经验的玩家尝试，在此仅作一个补充渠道供大家参考。\n​三：车型怎么选​\n​房车类型主要是C型和B型，C型的空间大，装载能力强，配置和储物空间更丰富，适合多人使用，但是驾驶起来不是很方便，比如在城区穿行、停车时都不太灵活，如果开省道、乡道，很多限高杆也会过不去；而B型房车的空间比较小，适合两个人使用，但开起来比较灵活，能通过更多的限高杆。C型车的租金一天在1200-1500元左右，B型车在700-1000元左右。\n​如果你对房车的舒适性要求比较高，或者带着一家老小，也可以选择带拓展的房车，驻车时可以获得更大的生活空间，当然，租金方面也会更贵一些。​\n\n​\n​四：配置方面要注意什么\n​不管你是为了购置房车前先体验，还是为了偶尔出游，租房车时一定要注意所选车型的配置，不然会大幅降低你的房车使用舒适性，进而对房车有所误解。\n​最常见的问题就是租赁商没给你提供马桶降解剂、房车电器设施不足、缺乏充电设施。\n​很多没接触过房车的人会误以为房车的马桶要自己倾倒未经处理的排泄物，其实房车马桶是要配合降解剂使用的，经过降解后，马桶里的东西就会变成无臭的绿水，不会很恶心（但会有降解剂本身特殊的味道）。\n​一些租赁商的房车是低配车，生活电瓶容量很小，逆变器功率也不大，不仅用不了微波炉、电磁炉、空调等大功率设备，而且很快就会缺电，这会大幅降低使用体验，务必要询问清楚电瓶容量和逆变器功率。对于空调，尽量选择有220V车载空调或家用空调的房车，效果会更好。\n​有大电池却缺乏充电手段也不行。很多车型只能用底盘车自带的小功率行车发电机、太阳能和外接电进行充电，这三种方式充电效率都非常低，无法满足使用。尽量选择有大功率行车发电和支持快充的房车，前者发动车辆后可以在两三小时内充满电，不心疼油费；后者可以利用现在越来越密布的充电桩充电，当然，不要影响到电动车主的充电哦。​\n​其他生活配置大多房车都会配好，比如热水器、暖气、床单被褥等，如果需要用到锅碗瓢盆可以提前问问是否提供，不提供就得自己带上了。​\n​其他方面和租赁普通家用车流程是一样的，都要准备好驾照、身份证、预授权的信用卡或支付宝等。",

          "description": "沙牛提示\n\n阅读本文需要 3 分钟，安利我的新玩意儿——一台超迷你主机！ \n如果你喜欢本文，就分享给你的小伙伴！\n\n01 需求\n最近几年，对电子产品的欲望降低了很多。不过，两个月前，我萌生了弄一台办公小主机的需求。\n其实，对于电脑，我一直没有太高的需求，不看 4K，更不玩游戏，最复杂最耗资源的需求，那就是视频剪辑了。\n不过，我的视频剪辑需求，也算是非常入门了——只是使用 Camtasia 来完成课程视频的剪辑工作。\n之前使用的电脑，都是笔记本：一台 Macbook Pro，一台华为。但因为办公升降桌很小，笔记本 + 带鱼屏往上一放，就更打挤了。\n所以，迷你主机的需求，就这样诞生了。之所以需要迷你，是因为我不希望它太占空间，不然还不如继续用笔记本呢。\n02 选品\n最初，我本打算入手 Mac Mini，下单之前，顺手看了下 MacBuyer's Guide（一个提供 Apple 家产品购买建议和指南的网站）：\n\n好家伙，这一代 Mac Mini 已经发布 604 天，而平均更新周期为 634 天，所以，网站直接给打上了” 不要购买 “的标签：\n\n我可不想前脚刚原价购买，后脚就上了新一代产品。所以，果断放弃。\n然后，逛张大妈的时候，无意间发现这么个玩意儿：\n\n这玩意儿叫DeskMini，看了一下详细介绍，机箱只有 1.9L，甚至比一瓶拉罐可乐大不了多少，嗯，尺寸似乎正合我意！\n但这只是一个机箱 + 主板的准系统，我得自己另行购买 CPU、内存和硬盘。\n挑选了一下，粗略计算了个总价，似乎能控制在 3500 以内，ok，下手！\n\n于是，我就这样用上了人生中的第一台迷你组装机。\n03 装机\n准系统拿下，实际到手价格 909，包含机箱、电源、主板和风扇，另外还有一个无线网卡。\n然后查了不少资料，确定下AMD R5600G这款 CPU，散片 1089 拿下！\n硬盘不用太大，毕竟我有 NAS 服务器，所以，1TB 的铠侠 NVME 固态，527 拿下！\n内存么，之前的电脑都是 16G，剪视频 + 开虚拟机的情况下，有些捉襟见肘，所以，怎么也得上 32G 吧…… 最后，654，拿下两条 16G 镁光 DDR4 3200。\n然后，查了一下自带的无线网卡，最高速度 433 Mbps，岂不是让我的 NAS 毫无用武之地？怎么也处上 2.5G 无线网络吧？\n好的，AX210 无线网卡安排上！拼多多 75 到手！\n所有配件到齐，装机——\n\n不得不说，第一次自己装机，我是真的手残，找了 N 个视频，折腾了两个小时，终于给装上了……\n\n是真的很小，比我 500ml 的茶杯大不了多少，放桌面上毫无违和感。\n04 体验\n然后，重新整理桌面空间、开机、装上 Win11，常用的软件装上，测试视频编码。\n旧的电脑，视频编码 CPU 占用直接狂飙到 100%，这小主机，占用率一起处于 60% 左右。\n内存也一直没用到一半。\n\n真香！\n甚至，几年不玩游戏的我，还特意下载了 Steam，入手了地平线 5……\n没错，集显玩地平线 5！\n\n开低画质（第二档，下面还有极低），挺流畅的，不过没有测试帧率。\n到这一步，我只能说：\n\nAMD Yes!\n\n05 再次折腾\n用了一周之后，我发现一个严重的问题：\n\nCPU 温度时常接近 70 度。\n\n作为一名完美主义者，这能忍？\n所以，我又萌生了换个散热器的想法。\n因为主机太小，所以最高仅支持 46mm 的散热器。\n所以，103，拿下这个规格的利民散热器！\n安装安装安装……\n\n不得不再次吐槽，我手是真的残，换个散热器，又搞了两个钟头……\n而且因为底部螺丝拧得太紧，主板都给干弯了……\n好了，温度果然下降了好几度，舒服了！\n再后来，我又发现，这主机虽小，但扩展性还挺高：居然支持同时插上两块 NVME 硬盘、两块 2.5 寸 SATA 硬盘。\n好的，继续拆！\n把我闲置的 SATA 固态给装上当下载盘。\n不得不说，手残归手残，折腾是真的爽啊！\n06 结语\n后面又买了一些小玩意儿，汇总一下这次折腾的总费用——\n\n3400 不到的一台小主机，既能满足我办公的所有需求，又满足了自己折腾的欲望，何乐而不为呢？\n因为机箱超小的关系，即便淘汰以后，还能做一台 HTPC 或者远程访问主机，多香呀~",

          "description": "今天去参加了飞书在深圳的城市大会，现场聆听谢欣讲了飞书的整体逻辑，组织管理的关键点是文化、制度、工具，前两者都很难改变，只有工具才是最佳切入点。回想起少数派折腾工具，建立团队协作的过程，有一些值得分享的幕后故事。\n\n作为一群研究并推荐工具的年轻人，自然也要真正用上这些「先进」工具，所以我们很早就开始启用 Slack 和 Quip 这些海外工具应用。应该说，海外工具的开放性和创新性，确实给团队协作带来了很多有趣的玩法，穿梭于个各个工具之间，用机器人建立各种自动化流程，避免了很多重复劳动，我们也很快开始为这些工具付费了。\n后来，团队成员慢慢变多，每个新人都要注册一堆海外工具账号，学习成本不断增加，数据风险也开始不可控。我们也不断尝试国内的协作工具，定位和文化的各种原因，确实没法满足团队的需求。\n\n同一时间段，上万人规模的字节跳动，也在经历这个过程，各种折腾之后，他们决定开发自己的团队协作工具——飞书。\n少数派接触飞书其实非常早期。我们一直用媒体资源扶持中小开发者，其中有一个日程工具产品被字节收购，创始人并入了飞书项目组。他作为少数派的资深读者，一直推荐我们关注飞书产品，并且敢打保票，包你满意。\n\n我当时就质问他：你们大公司做项目，经常是壮士断腕，万一市场反馈不好，说停就停了，我们整个团队也跟着白折腾了。\n他说：你放心，字节几万人都靠这套工具运作，每年节省下来的人效成本，都足够养活整个工程部门了，放心大胆用吧。\n\n于是，我们就成了飞书最早期的小客户，虽然那时的产品还有很多小 Bug，但确实保持了其他平台欠缺的开放性和创新性，团队成员直接从海外工具平移过渡，用的顺手，很快就升级付费了。\n我们自己用好之后，还推荐给内容同行们试试，包括小特社区、影视飓风、先看评测等团队都开始尝试和采买飞书，整体反馈也相当不错。\n紧接着，2020 年疫情爆发，大家纷纷开启了远程办公模式，飞书为了帮扶更多中小企业转型线上，下放了整个 Office 的协作功能，开启了阶段性的免费模式，这也带来了很多效率工具的个人用户。\n\n借着这个机会，我们也开始琢磨飞书产品的外部生产力价值。于是，我们将几百人的作者社群，从微信搬到了飞书，用即时通讯模块讨论选题，用飞书文档来约稿创作，用飞书表格来进行内容排期，最后我们还开发了「少数派助手」企业应用，帮助作者把飞书文档上的成稿，一键同步到少数派，并直接发布。飞书不仅解决了内部协作需求，也变成了少数派整个内容创作流程的生产力工具。\n\n转眼两年过去了，飞书从 Office 工具切入，不仅提供了完善的在线文档、多维表格等功能。现在已经开始提供基于人员管理的 People 服务；基于产品研发的飞书项目；基于行政财务的财税综合服务。企业协作体系更加健全了，也开始制定了新的收费策略，价格虽然已经是当年的好几倍，但我们还是选择了付费。\n另一个特别有趣的现象是，我们发现身边有大量的生产制造企业也开始使用飞书，包括安克、飞傲、渴创等等，少数派很多品牌客户、联名合作商，都把微信沟通群迁移到飞书上，用文档讨论项目，用表格处理货品，用飞书开会，大家的效率都得到了提升。\n如今，飞书已经开始服务理想汽车、元气森林、华润等各个领域的中大型企业了，我们却还是一个几十人的小公司，没能跟上时代的大潮，倍感惭愧。但我们在飞书上有数百人的作者群，还有数千人的会员群，他们都是来自各行各业的精英，都在跟少数派一起体验着飞书的产品魅力，这也算是给未来的「先进企业」埋下火种了。\n当然，工具再好，效率再高，也不要了忘了我们追求效率的最终目的，不是攀比谁更狠，谁更卷，而是要把节省出来的时间，更多的放在兴趣爱好和品质生活上，人生不能只活在科技和效率之中，还有广袤的田野和动人的音乐呢。",

          "description": "一直以来都有一个做自己产品的梦想，在移动互联网初期的阶段，印象中还是在2012年，我在第二家任职公司主导做过一款产品上线，可惜当时年轻气盛没放在心上，我就去苦心钻研设计了。\n这10年里我一直在设计行业深耕，期间也与朋友做过一些产品，也有一些小的成果，由于种种原因最后产品被迫下架了，所以做产品这件事儿，其实陪伴了我的整个从业阶段。\n一直以来我认为音乐除了本身的声音以外，还应该传递更多的情绪。【Dtd Playlist】的出现，其实是我在疫情期间居家时，萌生出的一个念头，我想着是不是可以做一款放在桌面上“看着”的歌单产品？有了这个念头后，我就停不下来了，开始着手设计产品、原型、做UI以及相关的准备。\n现在你看到的这篇文章是我在验收完合伙人的代码、提了无数bug后，觉得需要记录一下整个过程。毕竟这是我的第一款产品，我要好好对它。\n产品名字是【Dtd Playlist】，看名字大家应该能猜得到是一款歌单App。\n💥  主打功能：\n🔳  精选10种常用场景音乐（学习场景、运动场景、摸鱼放空、深夜emo…），并且实时更新，源源不断\n🔳  超酷的GIF播放背景，还有有趣的数字时钟\n🔳  真空式播放，没有那些乱七八糟的，只有音乐\n🔳  不同风格的版式设计，放在桌面享受与众不同\n\n因为我自己是个资深的Apple Music和Spotify的用户，也是多年的歌单忠实爱好者，所以在筹备阶段，做的第一件事情就是思考我需要放哪些音乐进去？以及如何放？\n于是我找了非常多的资料，最后选定以【情绪、场景】来做整体的歌单分类，音乐接入Apple Music和Spotify，由于时间原因，第一个版本只支持Apple Music。\n歌单分类页面\n \n/late night🌛\n最终我精选了10个基于场景的播放列表，并制定了整体的获取机制，让产品随时更新和随机播放。\n另外在设计产品的过程中，我一直把设计图放在手机支架上，但我总会去偷看时间，所以在歌单的基础上，我希望用户侧目就可以看到正在播放的音乐以及现在的时间。\n所以最终的产品大概就是你们看到的这样：\n一个有点不一样、传递情绪的场景GIF + 一个有点意思的数字时钟。\n播放页面场景类别不同的播放版式\n想想还有哪几个隐蔽的点没有说...\n\n双击喜欢：双击喜欢歌曲后，会同步到Apple Music的喜欢列表，后续你可以在Apple Music听到更多同类型的音乐\n切换分类：第一版本还是希望产品更加简单一些，所以分类做的比较隐蔽，点击左上角可以展开\n\n后续看看用户反馈再做一些更新迭代，我自己也有一些迭代计划，大概是以下几点：\n\n接入Spotify\n歌单持续迭代的逻辑\n“喜欢的歌曲”列表\n持续更新更多版式\n音乐小组件\n\n【Dtd Playlist 】目前已正式上线，欢迎你在 App Store 下载体验。\n最后，希望【Dtd Playlist】能让你放在桌面享受与众不同的音乐，也欢迎大家评论区随时给我们提出意见及建议。\n接下来我也会着手进行第二款产品的设计以及开发工作，后续会持续在这里与大家同步。\n \n \n请扫描二维码下载Dtd Playlist",

Nikkei notes that Nikon’s SLR cameras were “widely used by professional cameramen for more than 60 years and have come to be seen as synonymous with the Japanese company.”\nNikon will continue to sell existing DSLR...\nContinue reading…",

The solo exhibition on view at Unit London showcases vivid paintings by Belgian artist Kristof Santy that transform humble fare like a cheddar wedge or slice of watermelon into bright, gastronomic celebrations.\nOften positioned against textured tile backdrops or striped wallpaper, the oil-based works tend to be either devoid of human life or portray figures in rigid stasis: a butcher stiffly lifts a broom in the shop doorway, a finger peels back a tin of fish with precision, and pans filled with sausages and other meats fry on a stovetop unsupervised.

When the bird’s long life is nearing an end, flames engulf its body, and the being is reborn as a chick in the ashes of its predecessor, giving it the distinction of resilience, regeneration, and immortality. As Yulia Brodskaya began to apply the curled and crimped tendrils of paper to her latest work, she tells Colossal that the firebird portrait “started as a visual representation of a powerful feeling rising from the deep,” adding that “it felt like this portrait has been ‘channelled’ through me.”\nBrodskaya captures the subtleties of individual expression and character in her elaborate portraits (previously) and depictions of flora and fauna.
