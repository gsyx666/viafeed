Here is a link to learn more about CSS and how to use it\nThe style rules in CSS are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the matching elements in your document.\nA style rule has three parts: selector, property, and value.\nFor example, the headline color can be defined as:\nh1 { color: blue; }\n\n\nThe selector points to the HTML element you want to style.\nOne or more declarations are contained in the declaration block and are separated by semicolons.\nType selectors are the most widely used and simple to comprehend selectors.

To do so use the Arduino programming language (based on wiring) and the Arduino Software (IDE) based on processing.\nA three-terminal resistor with a sliding or revolving contact that creates a variable voltage divider is called a potentiometer. It functions as a variable resistor or rheostat if only the wiper and one end of the connector are used.\nint sensorPin = A0;    // select the input pin for the potentiometer\nint ledPin = 13;      \nint sensorValue = 0;  \nvoid setup() {\npinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\nvoid loop() {\n  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);\n  delay(sensorValue);\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);\n  delay(sensorValue);\n}",

By storing the results of the function calls, we can avoid having to recalculate them each time, which can lead to significant performance gains.\nFor example, consider the following recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number:\nfunction fib(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) {\n    return n;\n  }\n    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);\n }\n\nThis function works by recursively calling itself with different values for n.

Yes... you took a risk for brain damage in order to come up with a password like this or let your password manager did the job en still it can be cracked so so fast.\nIn 2020 this password was cracked in 8 hours. That's just 12 times slower then what it is now, imagine how fast it will be within the next 2 years from now.\nBest possible way to come up with a password is according to the Diceware-method https://diceware.dmuth.org/\nExperts use this to add randomness to the words your password contains. Every 5 numbers you throw in a row belongs to a word. Repeat this process until you have at least 7 words and create a passphrase:\nCannonVirtuousMovableUnnerveRectifiedCreasing\n\nOne problem is this won't be acceptable by our minimal requirements like we said in the beginning. Of course we can add a number and exclamation mark or whatever, but this isn't the best solution.\nAlso this is pretty harshe to ask everyone to do for \"just a password\". This also depends on what the value is of what you are trying to secure. But since people are lazy, lets come up with a solution that works for everyone.\nWhat we can do is higher the least minimal of characters used. If you go from 8 to 12, this means it can be cracked in 3000 years(!) in 2022. Still in 2020 this was 34000 years, so what will it be within the next 2 years?

Let us know, we're excited about your feedback!\nExtended documentation and use cases\nYouTube, on our GitHub, and on our community spaces (discussion forum and Discord).\nArchitectural changes\n\nTo stay up-to-date with everything, make sure to subscribe to our newsletter, and don't forget to give us a star on GitHub.

          "description": "Now that we had a look at finding the min/max from an array of arrays, let's see how we can go a step further and sort all the items based on a sub-array value.\nTo sketch the problem, let's say we have the following array of users.\nconst users = [\n  ['Nicole', 31],\n  ['Chris', 33],\n  ['Sanne', 1],\n  ['Yaatree', 2],\n];\n\nThe users' array contains sub-arrays representing a user's first name and age.\nWe can actually use the native sort method to achieve our goal of sorting this array.\nIn its most basic form, you can call if on an array, and it will try to sort them based on the contents.\nIt would look like this:\nconsole.log(['b', 'c', 'a'].sort());\n\n// [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]\n\nHowever, it's a bit more complicated in our case as we have an array of arrays.\nconsole.log(users.sort());\n\n// Returns:\n// [\n//  [ 'Chris', 33 ],\n//  [ 'Nicole', 31 ],\n//  [ 'Sanne', 1 ],\n//  [ 'Yaatree', 2 ]\n// ]\n\nThis is great if we want to sort on the first name, but we want to sort on the age value.\nThis is where the extra powers of the sort method come in.\nusers.sort((a, b) => {\n  // Do something with a and b\n});\n\nThe above example code is the syntax we can use.\nSince we are sorting on numbers, they even give us a quick option to sort them.\nusers.sort((a, b) => {\n  return a[1] - b[1];\n});\n\n// Returns:\n// [\n//  [ 'Sanne', 1 ],\n//  [ 'Yaatree', 2 ],\n//  [ 'Nicole', 31 ],\n//  [ 'Chris', 33 ]\n// ]\n\nWe can also change the order by switching the a and b comparison around.\nusers.sort((a, b) => {\n  return b[1] - a[1];\n});\n\n// Returns:\n// [\n//  [ 'Chris', 33 ],\n//  [ 'Nicole', 31 ],\n//  [ 'Yaatree', 2 ],\n//  [ 'Sanne', 1 ]\n// ]\n\nAnd to top it off, we can write this as sort hand functions to make it super clean.\nusers.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]));\n\nAnd that's it. We learned how to sort an array based on a sub-array value.\nThank you for reading my blog. Feel free to subscribe to my email newsletter and connect on Facebook or Twitter",

I leaned in to the monitor eventhough the brightness was full. \n\n\nIf you're comfortable reading code in light mode in your current environment then thats light mode is for you.\nAs I always work in a well lit environment the light mode really helps see the code sharply. Just like 📝 paper and ink.\nIts not just coding but on other places too! I felt more comfortable seeing in light mode in environment.\n\n\nThese preferences are going to change as the day progress.\nSo ultimately if you are doing a lot of coding in the low light, dark mode is best. If you are doing in day time I prefer light mode ( atleast for me ). \nI do both.\nThere never been one preference is better than other. Thats why its called preferences! \nThanks & Cheers!\nPeace 🕊",

Today I’ll be discussing the concept of SVMs (Support Vector Machine), a subset of Machine Learning used commonly for classification and regression analysis. First off, we must discuss how SVM works from a theoretical standpoint.\n\nThe three lines seen (H1, H2, and H3) are known as “Hyperplanes”, which divide our data into classes. To define a hyperplane, one must follow a simple procedure:\nDraw a line between the two classes such that the closest data point from each class (known as the support vector) are equidistant from the line. Thus, we have defined a Hyperplane.\nHowever, it soon becomes apparent that an infinite number of hyperplanes can be derived. The obvious question arises: “How do we determine which hyperplane to use?” The answer is, we use the hyperplane which…",

          "description": "Technology has grown much faster than everything else. All the technology is developed because of coding and programming.\nSo what's the difference between coding and programming. \nBecause computers do not understand human languages. Coding allows humans to communicate with the computer. Code instructs the computer which tasks to be performed and what things to do. Learning code also helps develop applications, websites AI tools and even Internet of Things(IOT) among others.\nCoding is a process of establishing a successful communication between a software program and the computer hardware. The compilers translate the program into assembly language. The coding process converts the assembly language to Binary Coded Signals.\nProgramming is an act of designing and developing a logical software solution to the problem statement. It involves designing and developing the algorithms, flowcharts, and implementing the solution using a programming language.\nProgramming is a complex task. Unlike coding, programming is carried out in Stages. Following are the stages of programming a software application.\nProblem Statement\nDesigning Algorithms and Flowcharts\nSoftware Development\nSoftware Documentation\nSoftware Maintenance \nCoding uses traditional code/program editing tools like notepad, notepad++, Eclipse, and so on.\nProgramming tools are not confined to only editing a program. It involves interoperability between different software applications via data connectors. A software web application might have to store and manipulate data in a database and many more.\nIf you have any questions about on \"Coding Vs Programming\", mention them in the comment section below.\nIf this was helpful give me a like 👍 or share this article 😊\nAlso check out my blogs https://melbite.com/",

          "description": "Have you ever tried to add an event listener to a group of html elements all at once? if you had, you may had probably done something like this:\nconst buttons = document.getElementsByTagName(\"button\");\n\nbuttons.forEach((item) => {\n  item.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n    console.log(\"click\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe problem with the above code is that, when you finally check your browser console, you are going to encounter an error. Why?\nThis is because we are treating our list of buttons as an array while it is not.\nIt may look like an array, but it is actually either an htmlCollection or a nodeList. Whenever you make use of methods that fetch multiple elements/nodes from the DOM, that method either returns an htmlCollection or a nodeList.\nMethods that returns an htmlCollection include: document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName()\nMethods that returns a nodeList include: document.querySelectorAll(), document.getElementsByName()\nIn order to fix this problem, all you need to do is convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array. This way you can make use of array methods on it, and also add your event listener.\nYou can use any method you prefer in order to convert the htmlCollection/nodeList into an array, but my favorite way of converting them into an array, is by making use of the spread operator.\nconst buttons = document.getElementsByTagName(\"button\");\nconst buttonsArray = [...buttons];\n\nbuttonsArray.forEach((item) => {\n  item.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n    console.log(\"click\");\n  });\n});\n\n\nNow when you go to your browser console, everything will work as it is supposed to.",

Often developers compare GraphQL to REST APIs and see the N+1 requests (or over-fetching) as an important reason to go for GraphQL. Let's put that to the test and explore if GraphQL APIs actually can outperform existing REST APIs. For this, we'll take a GraphQL-ized REST API and test the performance of GraphQL and compare it to the REST approach. For this we'll be using the popular performance testing tool k6.\nBefore exploring a GraphQL API, let's learn more about the technology. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, designed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012 to handle API requests on low bandwidth networks. After being used internally, GraphQL was open-sourced in 2015.

To generate and add it to GitHub, you need to follow following steps,\nThe SSH key can be generated using ssh-keygen command using git bash as below,\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nreplace your_email@example.com with your actual email address.\nBy default, the SSH key will be stored in the home directory.

Software development best practices have given rise to many platforms and tools to deploy software quickly and easily. Kubernetes and Helm can do so much together in helping developers deploy software with less effort. Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for running container-based apps in the enterprise. In fact, organizations aim at running all their production deployments on Kubernetes. \nThese are exciting times for those in the Kubernetes community because we’re seeing more and more users leverage its extended capabilities for even deeper operational insight and control.

The graphic recognition of elements of your applications (web, mobile, desktop) to make comparisons of graphic elements with each other.\nUntil now, detections and comparisons of application elements required capturing an element and its text attributes. To do this, you used the capture tool of Agilitest which allowed you to dig into the tree structure of your application and its data logic.\nNow, this capture tool has been expanded with a graphical capture possibility which \"photographs\" a small area of ​​the application in order to detect its occurrence during a test, once or several times.\nTo use the graphics recognition functionality, simply open the Agilitest capture tool and select a rectangular area. The blue selection rectangle allows you to choose the area to be captured, for later detection during a test.\nSelection of a graphic area in Agilitest\nOnce the image is selected, Agilitest allows you to copy or save the image for external use, but you can also drop the image directly in an Agilitest comment or access the tree of elements to generate an activatable zone...\nRead full article here.",

So Algorithm is a major part of a software or application that defines all the business logic\nI started development in 2014. My first project was on Multi-Level Marketing binary Structure also called MLM Binary 1x2.\nThat was not easy for me to create the Tree logics that will generate dynamically.\n\nIt was hard for me to develop all the logic behind that tree with  lots of condition.\nIn 2014 there was no content on the Internet on how to build complex logic like MLM Binary 1x2. So I deeply did the experiments for almost 30 days. Then finally, I got a solution. I built that web application and provided it to the client. \nThe client was so happy because at that time there were very few developers who can do this. And the client ran the project for almost 2 years and earned a lot of money.\nSo after learning those complex logic, I was thinking other developers in the world facing the same issue. So I started a YouTube channel and told other developers how I build this.\nHere is the link - YouTube Channel\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  8 Years in developing Algorithms\n\n\nSo I did not stop here to create complex logic. Then I worked for many Software companies to build complex logic for them. I invested my 8 years to just creating logic. \nI think the journey in complex algorithm development will never end. Every day I learn new things and get more ideas. I still enjoy to develop Algorithms.\nCreating Algorithms is an Art",

          "description": "FreeDOS 提供了一个叫做 FreeDOS Edit 的用户友好的文本编辑器。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n在任何操作系统中，编辑文件都是一项常有的任务。当你想去做一个某事的笔记、写封信给朋友或升级一个系统配置 —— 你需要一个文本编辑器。FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器（也许没啥想象力）叫做 “FreeDOS Edit”。\n\r\n编辑文件\n\r\n最简单的启用 FreeDOS Edit 的方式就就是输入 EDIT。它提供一个空的编辑器窗口。图案背景显示为一个空的“桌面”——提醒你没有编辑任何文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n就像多数 DOS 应用程序一样，你可以按下你键盘上的 Alt 键来访问 Edit 的菜单。这就激活了这个菜单。在你按下 Alt 后，Edit 将切换到“菜单”访问方式，并高亮 “文件File” 菜单。如果你想要访问菜单栏上的一个不同的菜单，可以使用左右方向键。按向下的方向键并按下回车键来“进入”菜单。\n\r\n\n\r\n你注意到所有菜单标题的第一个字母是不同的颜色么？这种高亮字母显示了一种快捷方式。例如，“文件File”菜单的“F”高亮为红色。所以你可以按下 Alt+F（Alt 和 F 同时按下），Edit 会显示“文件File”菜单。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以使用“文件File”菜单来开始一个新的（空）文件，或打开一个存在的文件。让我们开始一个新文件，使用方向键移动到“新建New“然后按下回车键。你也可以用 Ctrl+N （Ctrl 和 N 同时按下）打开一个新文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n此后，编辑文件应该非常简单。大多数熟悉的快捷键都可以在 FreeDOS Edit 中使用：Ctrl+C 复制文本，Ctrl+X 剪贴文本，和 Ctrl+V 将复制的或剪贴的文本粘贴到新的地方。如果你需要在一个长文档中寻找一个特殊文本，按下 Ctrl+F。保存你的工作成果，请使用 Ctrl+S 以将变更提交到硬盘。\n\r\n在 Edit 中编程\n\r\n如果你是个程序员，你也许会发现扩展的 ASCII 表是一个有用的工具。DOS 系统支持“拓展的” ASCII字符集，通常被称之为“代码页 437”。0 到 127 的标准字符包括字母 A 到 Z（大写和小写）、数字和特殊字符，如标点符号。但是，从 128 到 255 的 DOS 拓展字符包括其它语言字符和“画线”元素。DOS 程序员有时需要使用这些拓展 ASCII 字符，所以 FreeDOS Edit 可以很容易地查看所有 ASCII 码和它们的相关字符的表格。\n\r\n要查看这个 ASCII 表，请使用“工具Utilities”菜单，选择“ASCII 表ASCII Table”菜单项，这将显示一个包含该表格的窗口。\n\r\n\n\r\n沿着左边，这张表显示十六进制值“00”到“F0”，顶部展示了单一值“0”到“F”。这些为每个字符的十六进制代码提供了一个快速参考。例如，第一行（00）和第一列（0）中的项目具有十六进制值 00 + 0，即0x00（“NULL”值）。而第五行（40）和第二列（1）中的字符，其数值为 40 + 1，即 0x41（字母 “A”）。\n\r\n\n\r\n当你在表格内移动光标高亮不同的字符时，你会看到表格底部的值发生变化，展示了字符的十进制、十六进制和八进制编码。例如，移动光标以高亮在 C0 行和第 5 列的“行交叉”字符，显示这个扩展字符的代码为 197（十进制）、0xc5（十六进制）和 305（八进制）。在一个程序中，你可以通过输入十六进制值 0xc5 或八进制“转义代码” \\305 来引用这个扩展字符。\n\r\n\n\r\n请随意浏览 Edit 中的菜单，以发现其他不错的功能。例如，“选项Options”菜单允许你更改 Edit 的行为和外观。如果你喜欢使用更密集的显示，可以使用“显示Display”菜单（在“选项Options”下）将 Edit 设置为 25、43 或 50 行。你还可以强制 Edit 以单色（黑底白字）或反转模式（白底黑字）显示。\n\r\n（文内图片来自 Jim Hall，CC-BY SA 4.0）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/6/freedos-text-editor\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lujun9972 译者：yjacks 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Cutefish OS 倒下几个月之后，被全球开源社区注意到了\n\r\n4 月份的时候，ZDNet 称其测试版为“你将使用的最可爱的 Linux 发行版”，称赞这个精雕细琢的基于 Debian 的 Cutefish OS “难以置信的优雅”，带有类似于 MacOS 的整洁的桌面。而我们 早已知道，这个由国内团队开发的桌面，已经失联一段时间了。有一些爱好者发起了复刻 Cutefish DE 的行动。而现在，国际开源社区也注意到了这一情况，并已经有一些社区在努力了。比如 OpenMandriva 试图给他们的发行版增加一个 Cutefish DE 桌面环境；Arch Linux 社区也有了独立的 Cutefish DE 软件包。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Debug Point\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：希望可以有一个正式的继承者可以接管 Cutefish DE 的遗产，让更多的贡献者可以加入其中。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n因无法找到合适的供应商，字节跳动考虑自研芯片\n\r\n字节跳动公司发言人今天证实，该公司正在探索可供自身在专业领域使用的芯片设计，因为该公司无法找到能够满足其要求的供应商。这些芯片将用来处理该公司在多个业务领域的相关工作负荷，包括视频平台、信息和娱乐应用。此举标志着字节跳动将加入一系列研发半导体的中国互联网巨头行列。过去几年，包括百度、阿里巴巴在内的许多公司都发布了自己设计的芯片。不过，他们仍需要台积电等代工商来帮助其生产芯片。字节跳动还表示，不会将其芯片销售给其他公司。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：凤凰网科技\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：似乎所有到了一定规模的 IT 公司，都需要将触角延伸到更深入的基础架构里，才能保持竞争力。不过，我觉得可能他们的计划更深远。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n新一代龙芯 3 号配套桥片发布，内部集成自研 GPU\n\r\n龙芯中科宣布，新一代龙芯 3 号系列处理器的配套桥片龙芯 7A2000 正式发布！相较于前一代产品，该芯片的高速 I/O 接口达到市场主流水平，并内置自研 GPU 核心，可形成独显方案，极大降低系统成本。“桥片”是板卡中连接 CPU 与外围接口/外设扩展接口的芯片，一侧与 CPU 直接进行数据交换，另一侧与硬盘、网络、显示等外设进行通讯。龙芯 7A2000 集成了 PCIE 3.0、SATA 3.0、USB 3.0/2.0 等接口，可为龙芯处理器提供丰富的南北桥功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：通信世界网\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：龙芯的进步还是值得点赞的。",

          "description": "了解一下自由软件基金会（FSF）。\n\r\n\r\n早在 1985 年，自由软件基金会（FSF）就开始提倡源代码共享的理念，并从此打响了为计算机用户和开发者捍卫权利的斗争。FSF 认为，用“开放Open”和“封闭Closed”这两个词来划分软件，十分具有局限性；于是，在为程序分类时，转而使用了以下词语：尊重自由（这个“自由free”或这个“自由Libre”）或践踏自由（“非自由non-free”或“专有proprietary”）。不管用语如何，关键之处在于，计算机必须受用户控制，而不是任由开发了计算机软件的公司来摆布。正因如此，GNU 工程、Linux 内核、Freedesktop.org 等众多自由软件项目，才会如此重要。\n\r\n最近，FSF 新上任了一位执行董事，她叫 Zoë Kooyman。我初见 Zoë 时，是在 2019 年的一个 All Things Open 大会上。当然，那个时候她还不是 FSF 的执行董事，不过已经在管理 FSF 不断增长的重大活动了 —— 包括 LibrePlant。她之前递给我了一份自由软件作者的名单，名单长得一眼望不尽，而且那些软件都是我每天在用的。由此，我也很受她那充沛的精力和诚恳的态度所打动。我只是偶然参加了一次 FSF 的聚会，但最后却和那些人成了朋友。是他们让我的数字生活有了意义，是他们保障了我能够拥有 Zoë 和 FSF 所说的 四项基本自由：\n\r\n\r\n无论用户出于何种目的，用户必须可以按照自己的意愿，自由地运行该软件（自由之零）。\n\r\n用户可以自由地学习并修改该软件，使它按照你的意愿进行计算（自由之一）。作为前提，用户必须可以得到该软件的源代码。\n\r\n用户可以自由地分发该软件的副本，这样就可以帮助别人（自由之二）。\n\r\n用户可以自由地分发该软件修改后的副本（自由之三）。借此，用户可以把改进后的软件分享给整个社区，令他人也从中受益。作…",

          "description": "这是一个可能的情景。你的系统收到了内核更新，但不知何故，事情不像以前那样顺利。\n\r\n你意识到，如果你启动到较旧的内核（是的，你可以降级内核），一切都会恢复正常。\n\r\n高兴之余你会觉得有点儿不爽。因为你不得不在每次启动时手动选择较旧的内核。\n\r\n一位年长的读者遇到了这个问题。Linux Mint 中的新内核更新没有按预期工作。启动到较旧的内核“修复”了问题，但麻烦的是在每次启动时要去手动选择较旧的内核。\n\r\n删除新内核而使用旧内核不是一个好主意，因为新内核将会在下一次系统更新时被安装使用。\n\r\n因此，我建议设置成默认启动到较旧的 Linux 内核。怎么做？这就是我将在本教程中向你展示的内容。\n\r\n启动至较旧的 Linux 内核\n\r\n你可能不了解，你的 Linux 发行版会在你的系统上安装多个 Linux 内核。不信？使用以下命令 列出 Ubuntu 中已安装的内核：\n\r\napt list --installed | grep linux-image\r\n\n\r\n当你升级系统时会获得一个新版本的内核，这时你的系统会自动选择启动至最新的可用内核。\n\r\n在 grub 屏幕中，你可以转到高级选项Advanced option（较旧的 Linux 版本）：\n\r\n\n\r\n在这里，你可以看到要启动的可用内核。选择较旧的（不带恢复选项recovery option 的条目）：\n\r\n\n\r\n你不会注意到任何显示的差异。你的文件和应用程序保持不变。\n\r\n现在你已经启动到旧内核，是时候让你的系统自动启动到它了。\n\r\n使旧内核成为默认启动项\n\r\n如果你乐于使用 Linux 终端和命令，你可以修改 /etc/default/grub 文件并在其中添加以下行：\n\r\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\r\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\r\n\n\r\n然后使用如下命令 更新 GRUB：\n\r\nsudo update-grub\r\n\n\r\n你在这里所做的是告诉你的系统将当前使用的启动项保存为将来运行 GRUB 的默认启动项。\n\r\n然而，并不是每个人都善于使用命令行，因此我将专注于一个名为 Grub Customizer 的 GUI 工具。\n\r\n安装 Grub Customizer\n\r\n使用官方 PPA 在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Grub Customizer：\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install grub-customizer\r\n\n\r\n对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器来安装此工具。\n\r\n使用 Grub Customizer 更改默认启动项\n\r\n当你运行 Grub Customizer 时，它会显示可用的启动项。\n\r\n\n\r\n在这里你有两个选择。\n\r\n选择一： 选择所需的内核项并使用箭头按钮（显示在顶部菜单上）将其向上移动。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择二： 将先前的启动项previously booted entry设为默认启动项default entry。\n\r\n\n\r\n我建议使用第二个选择，因为即使有新的内核更新它也可以工作。\n\r\n这样你就可以在 Ubuntu 或其他发行版中降级内核，甚至无需删除新内核版本。\n\r\n请注意，像 Ubuntu 这样的发行版大部分一次只保留两个内核版本。因此，最终你首选的旧内核将在新的内核版本释出时被删除。\n\r\n这个巧妙的技巧曾助我脱困。当时我 在 Ubuntu 中安装最新的 Linux 内核 ，由于某种原因它与我的音频系统有些兼容问题。\n\r\n无论是什么原因，你现在都知道如何自动启动到旧内核。\n\r\n如果有问题或建议，请在评论区留言。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/boot-older-kernel-default/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：hanszhao80 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "谷歌从安卓中移除大量 Fuchsia 代码\n\r\n本周，谷歌从安卓开源项目（AOSP）中移除了大量关于 Fuchsia 设备的代码。在谷歌的设想中，Fuchsia 设备可以运行来自安卓和 Linux 等其他系统的应用程序。想要达成这个目标有多种途径，谷歌最早尝试的是在一个虚拟机上运行完整的安卓系统实例，但这存在一些潜在的性能问题。另一种方式就是增强 Fuchsia 和安卓运行时环境的直接关系，在 2019 年时谷歌在 AOSP 里创建了一个项目，能够为 Fuchsia 设备创建安卓运行时。这次这些代码的移除，正式标志着这种方式的终结。在留下的 TODO 信息里，表明谷歌正在创建一个新的 “Starnix” 项目，让 Fuchsia 能够“原生”运行为 Linux/安卓开发的应用和库，即一个从 Linux 的底层内核架构到 Fuchsia 的 Zircon 内核的翻译层。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：9to5google\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实，谷歌在操作系统方面的野心很大，只是一直被掩盖在 Windows 和 Mac 下面没那么引人注意。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nopenSUSE 率先对 Nim 语言提供支持\n\r\nNim 语言 是一种新兴的语言，创建于 2005 年。这种经过编译的静态类型的编程语言有一个外部函数接口，可以与 C/C++、JavaScript 和其他语言交互。Nim 自称“结合了 Python、Ada 和 Modula 等成熟语言的成功概念”，以前曾被称为像 C 一样快，又像 Python 一样具有表现力、像 Lisp 编程语言一样可扩展。openSUSE 不仅宣布为 Nim 语言提供最新的软件包，而且对这个静态类型、命令式编程语言的提供一级支持。Nim 的作者及社区对 openSUSE 提供一级支持表示欢欣鼓舞。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：很多新兴语言都雄心勃勃，但是一种编程语言要成功，真有时候有很多侥幸的地方。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nRocky Linux 9.0 发布\n\r\nRocky Linux 9.0 建立在 RHEL 9.0 的基础上，并计划支持近十年，直到 2032 年 5 月。现有的Rocky Linux 8 将继续被支持到 2029 年 5 月。Rocky Linux 渴望成为 CentOS Stream 之前的 CentOS。由于使用了红帽企业 Linux 9.0 的源代码，它的所有功能与 5 月份达到 GA 的那个 RHEL 发行版相同。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：从目前看起来，Rocky Linux 和 Alma Linux 是最肖似 CentOS 的继承者了。",

          "description": "为何小小的单板机是智能工作以及小型办公室的未来。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n随着疫情的大流行，我们的工作方式也正在发生着改变。工作的分散化正在成为所有公司需要面临的一项重要挑战。\n\r\n智能办公室\n\r\n即使工厂认为智能办公仅仅是通过虚拟私有网络来对员工的笔记本电脑进行远程控制，再稍微增加一点进化也可以让一些基本的办公服务离人们更近一点，这些都能够极大降低数据中心的负载，并且提高人们的工作体验。这个方案还有一个额外的影响就是从信息和通信技术（ICT）上来说消除了许多单点故障。\n\r\n与其在公司外部有成百上千的工作场地，不如在世界范围内有着成百上千的小型办公室/分支，这就是所谓的“智能办公室”。\n\r\n这种表述可能会让许多 ICT 专家感到恐慌，因为这种文化使得每个办公室都与一台大机器（即服务器）联系在一起，即使分散计算资源的优势非常明显。\n\r\n一个不同的角度\n\r\n如果你能用一块 50 美元的小开发板提供一个大服务器的服务会怎么样？如果这个小板子只需要一张 SD 卡和一个普通的 USB 电源支持，那又会怎么样呢？这就是 树莓派 是最灵活的解决方案的原因所在。\n\r\n树莓派开发板是尺寸非常小的运行 Linux 的计算机。它有一个由树莓派基金会提供和维护的操作系统：树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。它基于 Debian，并与这个最知名的 Linux 发行版共享许多软件包。此外，许多树莓派的开发板能够完美运行最知名的 Ubuntu 服务器，它涵盖了 ARM 处理器支持，提供了对低功耗处理器的支持。\n\r\n但树莓派开发板对小公司来说也是一个很好的机会，以能够承担得起的代价获得大量的（开源）服务。但这种情况下，你必须考虑数据丢失的风险，因为你把所有的服务运行在一个小的、消费级的硬件上。不过设置正确的备份/恢复程序能够降低这些风险。\n\r\n你能从树莓派开发板上提供什么服务？\n\r\n大多数服务通常由更昂贵的服务器提供。这里的“大多数”取决于一些限制：\n\r\n\r\nARM 处理器： 一些软件包只支持 x86/x64 处理器。这是最难克服的挑战之一。但另一方面，ARM 处理器的市场份额不断增长，使得程序员为他们的软件开发了兼容 ARM 处理器的版本。\n\r\n内存容量： 这是一个仅限于在复杂应用以复杂的方式进行复杂的计算的情况下讨论的问题。很多时候，这只不过是关于重新审查代码、拆分步骤，并保持简单高效的问题。此外，如果一个服务虽然只服务少数几个用户，但需要大量的内存/CPU，这大概也意味着此服务没有正常工作。这可能是你消除浪费资源的旧问题的一个机会。最后，最新的树莓派开发板把内存容量升级到了 8GB，这是一个很大的提升。\n\r\n对服务器没有经验的用户： 这是另一个问题，你可以在基础镜像所在的树莓派的 micro-SD 卡中存储系统和运行数据。\n\r\n\r\n也就是说，你能够用树莓派做很多有趣的事情。在 我的博客 里，我通过运行各种服务进行了测试 —— 从基本的 LAMP 服务器到复杂的 CRM。从简单到复杂系统，全部都是开源的，例如：\n\r\n\r\n代理服务器（也能够添加广告拦截服务）\n\r\n电子邮件服务器\n\r\n打印服务器\n\r\n酒店管理\n\r\n联系关系管理（CRM）\n\r\n私人社交网络\n\r\n私人论坛\n\r\n私有 Git 门户网站\n\r\n网络监控服务器\n\r\n许多其他有用的服务\n\r\n\r\n对树莓派来说，另一个有趣的用法是在你的远程办公室获得提供高级服务的 Wi-Fi 热点，并且可以从它的以太网端口进行控制。\n\r\n最后，树莓派也能够运行容器，这是一个额外的工具，从这个不可思议的开发板中获得一个可用的服务世界。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/raspberry-pi-business\n\r\n作者：Giuseppe Cassibba 选题：lujun9972 译者：void-mori 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "学习如何用动态链接库将多个 C 目标文件结合到一个单个的可执行文件之中。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当使用 C 编程语言编写一个应用程序时，你的代码通常有多个源文件代码。\n\r\n最终，这些文件必须被编译到一个单个的可执行文件之中。你可以通过创建静态或动态库（后者也被称为 共享shared 库）来实现这一点。这两种类型的库在创建和链接的方式上有所不同。两者都有缺点和优点，这取决于你的使用情况。\n\r\n动态链接是最常见的方法，尤其是在 Linux 系统上。动态链接会保持库模块化，因此，很多应用程序可以共享一个库。应用程序的模块化也允许单独更新其依赖的共享库。\n\r\n在这篇文章中，我将演示动态链接是如何工作的。在后期的文章中，我将演示静态链接。\n\r\n链接器\n\r\n链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的数个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。\n\r\n链接器的功能包括：\n\r\n\r\n整合一个程序的所有的部分\n\r\n计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起\n\r\n恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行\n\r\n解析符号引用\n\r\n\r\n链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名为可执行文件executable的可以运行的程序。在你创建一个动态链接的可执行文件前，你需要一些用来链接的库，和一个用来编译的应用程序。准备好你 最喜欢的文本编辑器 并继续。\n\r\n创建目标文件\n\r\n首先，创建带有这些函数签名的头文件 mymath.h ：\n\r\nint add(int a, int b);\r\nint sub(int a, int b);\r\nint mult(int a, int b);\r\nint divi(int a, int b);\r\n\n\r\n使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：\n\r\n//…",

          "description": "Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMeta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。\n\r\n现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。\n\r\n（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）\n\r\nMeta 试图不落下任何语言\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。\n\r\n虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。\n\r\n因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。\n\r\nNLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。\n\r\n正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！\n\r\n为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。\n\r\n你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。\n\r\n对社会事业的鼓励\n\r\nMeta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。\n\r\n项目的影响\n\r\n尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。\n\r\n许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。\n\r\n你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/meta-open-source-ai-model/\n\r\n作者：Rishabh Moharir 选题：lkxed 译者：fenglyulin 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "新款支持 Pluton 的 ThinkPad 默认不能安装 Linux\n\r\nPluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，不为他们所用的 Linux 不是好 Linux，而要为他们所用，可以是子系统、可以是虚拟机，对吧。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍\n\r\nCanonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：总算是又进一步改善了 Snap，虽然还有一些缺陷。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWeb3 项目今年前半年因黑客攻击损失超过 20 亿美元\n\r\n根据一项研究报告，Web3 领域仍然受到黑客、诈骗和网络钓鱼计划的困扰，同时还面临着相对较新的威胁，如闪电贷款攻击。在今年的前六个月，Web3 项目因黑客和漏洞而损失超过 20 亿美元，超过了去年全年。此外，研究还发现，Discord 是绝大多数网络钓鱼企图的载体，这是一个信号，表明它作为 Web3 的首选社交网络仍然很受欢迎，尽管安全问题不断。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Web3 虽然以积木式金融为创新，但是其最大的问题可能也来自于这种积木式结构。",

          "description": "我非常贪恋睡眠，因为我每天都会做梦，并且第二天起来，我几乎都记得自己做了什么梦。无论是好梦、荒诞的梦、还是噩梦，我都会贪恋其中不愿意起床，它们仿佛短暂的解开了我的脚铐手链，让我飞了一会，飞到了一个和我的真实生活完全不一样的世界。\n如果我放任自己开始苏醒，真实生活里的点点滴滴，就会像早晨洗脸被拧开的水龙头的水一样，涌入大脑还泄流不止。一睁开眼睛就开始思考真实生活，真是一件悲伤的事。所以当我不得不起床之后，我总会尽我所能留住那种和现实脱节的感觉，能留多久是多久。能暂时不展开真实生活的点点面相，就暂时不展开。\n这种不展开的方式，于我而言就是阅读、纯粹的写作、或者看电影。阅读，是掉入另一个人的大脑去看 TA 写出来的世界；写作，是掉入自己的思想，内观自己的思绪世界；有时我也会一起床先看一部电影。电影，啊，电影，那就是另一个人的故事了，与我完全没有关系的陌生人的生活。这些都是逃离，让我暂时不必被真实生活的清单事项所淹没。\n也因此，我的生活在某个节点，被分割成了「之前」和「之后」，这个节点的划分，于我而言就是开微信：查收微信消息的那一刻，就代表着我被拉回现实，开始需要处理跟真实生活息息相关的消息、通知、事项。我上午从不开微信，一般看微信都是下午1点后了。当然，这种回归现实的方式，也是循序渐进式的：1点前后，我会第一次开微信，只是纯粹接收消息，确认无要紧之事后，又立刻关闭微信。直到下午3点我的微信才正式处于常开状态，表示我正式接受来自真实生活里清单事项的随时打扰，繁碎日常正式拉开序幕。\n我现在颇享受这种隔离时段式的生活节奏，3点之前专注创作，3点之后回归生活，「回归」这个词已经说明，我刻意与真实生活保持距离的个人态度。我的一天于是就这样拥有了两幅面孔：上午，是流离于真实生活的异想世界，下午，是落地于真实生活的现实世界。那晚上呢？\n晚上，是所有互联网产品必争的时段，也是人最情绪化，情感状态最饱满的时候。这个时刻，我又有了一种脱离真实生活的漂浮感，但它和上午的「脱离」还不太一样。上午的脱离感是我刻意营造的，晚上的脱离感则是浑然天成的。它是异想世界和真实生活经过漫长一天的交织、杂融、沉淀之后形成的，自带一种未经雕琢的生野感，能随时将你吞噬，将你包围，张力如此之强，让你无处遁型。所以，人才会多半选择在晚上谈情做爱，那种呼之欲出、溢都溢不住的原始本能，不仅是商家必争，也是艺术家必争。这个最容易飘的时段，我觉得也是最能体现我与自己是否真的自洽的时刻。你能多大程度上接受自己的各种情绪？允许它？放任它？还是压制它？抵制它？与晚上的相处，具有了一种哲学感：是什么？为什么？你想干什么？\n可惜，到现在我依然还在摸索与深夜的相处之道：「情绪那么饱满，你总不能浪费吧？」脑子里这个声音颇为强烈，总觉得我应该物尽其用。可每一天的晚上都不太一样，今晚如蜜糖般的度过方式，放在明天也许就是砒霜。何为物尽其用？更何况，多数时候，夜晚让我觉得自己过得失败而忙碌，怎么又是一个颗粒无收，或效果甚微的一天？所以我现在会想，或者，选择给夜晚注入理性哲思，本身就是一个错误，所以我才会屡战屡败，跟它过得如此拧巴。\n那不如，就让上午承担想象，下午承担事项，晚上它什么也别承担了。就如情绪，它最需要的也许就只是被看见。也别绞尽脑汁赋予它什么意义，哪有那么多事需要意义？\n所以，我总结出了什么吗？我享受我割裂的三段式生活节奏，我给「幻想」和「现实」各自独立的空间，并保证雨露均沾。至于晚上，我不为难它，它也不必为难我。三十后的“自处之道”，大抵如此。",

          "description": "不知道从什么时候开始，拆解并装裱废弃的电子产品开始流行起来，甚至一些厂商也下场提供了官方的装裱服务。\n我收藏了两部诺基亚Lumia925，可惜其中一部已经不能开机了，尝试过刷机救砖也不行，便想着把它也装裱起来，当一个摆设继续发挥余热。\n看了下网上卖的模版有点千篇一律，而且价格也不便宜。看了几家店铺的介绍后，发现其实工序并不复杂，就打算自己试一下。开头先给大家分享一下我的装裱成果：\n\n个人还是比较满意的。相框是A4纸的尺寸，整体还是比较紧凑的，因为觉得太大了有点占地方，缺点就是参数不能写得太多，一些小的零件就放不下了，大家如果想要把全部零件都展示出来的话，相框可以选择大一点的。\n所需素材&价格：\n\n宜家相框（39元）\n铜版纸（4元）\n热熔胶（已有的）\n双面胶（已有的）\n手机拆机工具（已有的）\n旧手机（已有的）\n\n因为一些材料是之前就有的，所以整体花费是40多元，大头都在宜家的相框上了，网上应该能够买到同尺寸更便宜的。下面就分享一下具体的步骤。\n第一步：拆手机、零件归类\n搜索手机型号+拆机教程，就可以找到详细的拆机步骤。如果没有工具的话，网上很便宜就能买一套（其实老手机最需要的就是撬棒）。\n拆解的过程大家可以量力而行，把重要的部件拆下来就行，也不一定非要追求「芯片级」的拆解。\n拆解之后可以简单把零件归类、简单摆放一下，简单构思一下背景图纸的布局，看看有没有什么零件是可以舍弃的。\n\n第二步：设计、打印背景图片\n有了零件之后，就到了发挥大家创意的地方——设计背景图纸。我是用PS先建立了一个A4尺寸的背景，然后将网上查到的主要参数列了上去，因为A4纸空间有限，只分出了屏幕、背盖、电池、主板、摄像头、卡槽和其他组件几个模块。\n为了保证原汁原味，下图左上角的logo是我从当年的广告片里截取出来的；右上角的彩条是我根据当年Lumia经典的配色PS上去的，让整体色彩稍微多一些，要不然就太单调了。我把这个背景图纸传到网盘了（提取码：jvgg），大家看得上的话可以直接拿去用。\n\n设计好之后，如果家里有打印机的话，可以打出来看一下位置摆放是否合理，顺便看下字体的大小是否合适，再进行一些微调。\n不推荐直接用A4纸，太薄了撑不住零件。我去打印店咨询了一下更厚的纸张，店家给我推荐了300g的铜版纸，价格也不贵（A4尺寸2张4元）。大家想做的话，带着源文件直接找打印店就行。\n第三步：粘贴零件、安装相框\n准备好零件和背景图之后，最后一步就比较简单了。用热熔胶枪把零件都粘贴在背景图纸上，电池最好直接用双面胶，不要接触高温的热熔胶。粘好后清理掉热熔胶的「拉丝儿」，等上一段时间粘牢固。\n\n宜家的相框有三层，透明面板、中框、背部盖板，粘好零件的背景图纸放在中框和背部盖板之间就可以，如果松动的话，可以用胶水把背景图纸和背部盖板粘在一起。\n以上就是所有的步骤啦，虽然整体的精致程度不如网上的一些模版，但是自己动手把心爱的手机装裱起来，这种感觉还是很不一样的，如果你有废弃的旧手机也可以自己动手试试。\n\n（我拍了一只视频来记录整个过程，大家感兴趣的话也可以去看看）",

          "description": "作为小米冲击高端的第 3 年、第 4 个系列，12S 系列凭借着「徕卡影像」的亮点可谓赚足了眼球。我也第一时间到小米之家把玩了真机，虽然质感有进步，但整体的感觉依然很小米，硬件设计依然没有延续性可言，好在高通这代处理器终于把功耗拿捏住了（比去年 11 Ultra 明显发热卡住好太多了）。\n不过我今年依然不会选购小米旗舰，因为小米始终没有解决一个问题：R角设计。\n\n声明：我并没有相关的从业背景，所以并不清楚更专业且准确地描述这个问题，只能从普通消费者的角度形容这个问题。如有描述错误，请见谅。\n\nR 角设计是指什么？\nR角：R是圆角， Radius，指內圆弧角或外圆弧角。在手机硬件上看 R角设计的好坏时，我会把机身弧角、屏幕弧角放在一起看，因为这本质上就是把圆角放在其他圆角里。\n我们先来看看小米12S Ultra 的 R角设计：\n\n很明显，小米12S Ultra 的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率并不连续（有曲面屏的影响），也并非同心圆的关系，两个圆角曲率处有着奇怪的「畸形」。虽然这一代比小米11 Ultra 进步很多，但观感上依然别扭。\n\n而我眼中正确的 R 角设计，代表性的有苹果 iPhone 的全面屏机型、三星S22、谷歌 Pixel 5等，它们的机身弧角、屏幕弧角的曲率连续，且处于同心圆的位置，看起来有秩序且耐看。苹果甚至还把这种「讲究」运用在了软件硬件的结合上，比如 iPhone 全面屏版本界面底部专属的 Dock 栏，以及 Dock 栏的图标与机身机身弧角、屏幕弧角完美呼应：\n真的让人感觉十分舒适。图/ carlosnuila\n值得一提的是，iPhone 12 系列回归直角边框设计后， 苹果还将该设备上运行的 iOS 版本进行了 R 角微调，即便它和  iPhone X、iPhone 11 系列都是运行同样的 iOS 系统，但机身硬件外观圆角曲率产生了变化，「执拗」的苹果就在软件上准备了两种完全不同的圆角曲率分别与不同机身外观进行更好地呼应。\n\nR 角设计做好，意味着什么？\n可能很多朋友会认为，R角的设计无关紧要，只是像我这类的人过于吹毛求疵。\n我尊重这个观点，因为多数设备的 R 角设计问题确实没那么重要。比如小米12S Ultra 这款机器整体表现出众，但它硬件设计缺乏的延续性、高端旗舰缺乏的精致感等问题，远比解决 R 角设计重要得多。\n但就我个人角度而言，手机是我每天接触最长的电子设备，而且这几年手机迭代升级提升有限，更换周期比以往慢了许多，所以我更在乎手机的外在形象和整体体验。\n手机在进入全面屏设计以后，我觉得是一个技术革命的开始，因为它让手机屏幕需要与边框之间的边界进一步缩小，达到一种近似融合的境界。\n图/giodp\n而优秀的 R 角设计，能让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，让屏幕与外壳间连接更趋向自然，让用户不能轻易感受到边界的存在，完全沉浸其中。反观设计不太好的 R 角，即便也有全面屏设计带来的震撼观感，但日常使用时也总能轻而易举感受到屏幕与外壳两者曲率处存在着奇怪的「畸形」，让技术革命带来的沉浸感始终不够彻底。\n让屏幕的外轮廓缺追随机身形态，这一项看似简单的设计，背后也都蕴藏着大量的技术成本，比如 OLED 屏幕的切割和折叠、电路面板的堆叠技术、圆角处的次像素反走样渲染、严格的界面 UI 设计规范等等。\n最后，我很希望后续小米能够重视 R 角的设计，早日推出更棒的旗舰产品。因为我始终觉得，手机进入全面屏时代后，手机同质化越来越严重，最美的「风景」不是莱卡蔡司等相机品牌的联名、不是越来越窄的边框、不是越来越快的快充技术、不是越拍越远的长焦，而是来自 2017 年 iPhone X 那张让人完全沉浸其中的全面屏设计宣传图：\n让人舒适的R角设计",

          "description": "房车生活是许多人向往的事情，不过一辆优质的房车价格不菲，而且目前房车市场也不像家用车一样可以方便地试乘试驾，因为有全国连锁4S店的房车厂屈指可数。所以当你有迈入房车生活计划的时候，不妨先挑一个假期，先租上几天玩玩，看看房车的驾驶体验和使用体验你能否接受、房车中的诸多不便你能否克服、房车生活是否真的能给你带来更多快乐。\n那么最重要的问题来了：怎么租？\n一：可信的房车租赁平台\n首先是大家都很熟悉的携程，App首页里就有租车频道，很多热门旅游城市都有房车可以选择。​\n\n​\n \n\n​\n​​我没在携程租过房车，但在不同城市租过十几次其他车型，总体的服务是满意的，由于有携程平台的监管，租赁公司也不太敢玩套路，而且他们普遍很在乎你在携程的评价，会尽力服务好你，有一次我还车时车身有一条很细的划痕，车商让我给个好评就不用我赔偿了。\n但在下订单前最好浏览一下评论，如果差评很多可以换一家车商。\n在携程租车的另一个好处是免费取消时间、不同档次的保险费用和权益都会清晰标注，可以按需选择，比如对驾驶有信息，就买个基础险，小事故需要自己理赔；如果技术一般，或者去的地方路况比较差，可以购买全险，出任何大小事故都是由车商处理，很省心。\n类似的还有飞猪、马蜂窝等平台。\n第二个推荐是上汽大通集团的官方房车租赁平台。\n上汽大通是国内比较少见的汽车主机厂原厂改装房车的厂商，实力比大部分房车厂都雄厚。而它也有自己的房车租赁服务平台：“房车生活家租房车”小程序。\n\n​\n由于汽车主机厂自营的优势，可以利用其4S店网络进行服务，所以覆盖的城市比较多，而且所租的车型很齐全、车况好，甚至一些特色车型是外面平台租不到的。\n这个小程序还可以方便地找到房车营地，基本覆盖了全国主要的房车营地和小车露营地，对于上汽大通合作的营地还可以方便地查看水电、停车收费情况和环境、玩乐项目，非常有心。\n\n​\n二：其他平台​\n​如果你对自己的鉴别能力有信心，其实也可以尝试在万能的“闲鱼”寻找出租的房车，其实有很多规模很小的租车公司都会在闲鱼发布信息，价格会比在平台上便宜一点，覆盖的城市也更多。​\n​但一定要鉴别对方是否有合法的租赁手续，必要时让提供出示营业执照等信息，而且一定要签好合同。\n​\n\n​\n但​闲鱼的监管作用有限，不推荐没有经验的玩家尝试，在此仅作一个补充渠道供大家参考。\n​三：车型怎么选​\n​房车类型主要是C型和B型，C型的空间大，装载能力强，配置和储物空间更丰富，适合多人使用，但是驾驶起来不是很方便，比如在城区穿行、停车时都不太灵活，如果开省道、乡道，很多限高杆也会过不去；而B型房车的空间比较小，适合两个人使用，但开起来比较灵活，能通过更多的限高杆。C型车的租金一天在1200-1500元左右，B型车在700-1000元左右。\n​如果你对房车的舒适性要求比较高，或者带着一家老小，也可以选择带拓展的房车，驻车时可以获得更大的生活空间，当然，租金方面也会更贵一些。​\n\n​\n​四：配置方面要注意什么\n​不管你是为了购置房车前先体验，还是为了偶尔出游，租房车时一定要注意所选车型的配置，不然会大幅降低你的房车使用舒适性，进而对房车有所误解。\n​最常见的问题就是租赁商没给你提供马桶降解剂、房车电器设施不足、缺乏充电设施。\n​很多没接触过房车的人会误以为房车的马桶要自己倾倒未经处理的排泄物，其实房车马桶是要配合降解剂使用的，经过降解后，马桶里的东西就会变成无臭的绿水，不会很恶心（但会有降解剂本身特殊的味道）。\n​一些租赁商的房车是低配车，生活电瓶容量很小，逆变器功率也不大，不仅用不了微波炉、电磁炉、空调等大功率设备，而且很快就会缺电，这会大幅降低使用体验，务必要询问清楚电瓶容量和逆变器功率。对于空调，尽量选择有220V车载空调或家用空调的房车，效果会更好。\n​有大电池却缺乏充电手段也不行。很多车型只能用底盘车自带的小功率行车发电机、太阳能和外接电进行充电，这三种方式充电效率都非常低，无法满足使用。尽量选择有大功率行车发电和支持快充的房车，前者发动车辆后可以在两三小时内充满电，不心疼油费；后者可以利用现在越来越密布的充电桩充电，当然，不要影响到电动车主的充电哦。​\n​其他生活配置大多房车都会配好，比如热水器、暖气、床单被褥等，如果需要用到锅碗瓢盆可以提前问问是否提供，不提供就得自己带上了。​\n​其他方面和租赁普通家用车流程是一样的，都要准备好驾照、身份证、预授权的信用卡或支付宝等。",

          "description": "沙牛提示\n\n阅读本文需要 3 分钟，安利我的新玩意儿——一台超迷你主机！ \n如果你喜欢本文，就分享给你的小伙伴！\n\n01 需求\n最近几年，对电子产品的欲望降低了很多。不过，两个月前，我萌生了弄一台办公小主机的需求。\n其实，对于电脑，我一直没有太高的需求，不看 4K，更不玩游戏，最复杂最耗资源的需求，那就是视频剪辑了。\n不过，我的视频剪辑需求，也算是非常入门了——只是使用 Camtasia 来完成课程视频的剪辑工作。\n之前使用的电脑，都是笔记本：一台 Macbook Pro，一台华为。但因为办公升降桌很小，笔记本 + 带鱼屏往上一放，就更打挤了。\n所以，迷你主机的需求，就这样诞生了。之所以需要迷你，是因为我不希望它太占空间，不然还不如继续用笔记本呢。\n02 选品\n最初，我本打算入手 Mac Mini，下单之前，顺手看了下 MacBuyer's Guide（一个提供 Apple 家产品购买建议和指南的网站）：\n\n好家伙，这一代 Mac Mini 已经发布 604 天，而平均更新周期为 634 天，所以，网站直接给打上了” 不要购买 “的标签：\n\n我可不想前脚刚原价购买，后脚就上了新一代产品。所以，果断放弃。\n然后，逛张大妈的时候，无意间发现这么个玩意儿：\n\n这玩意儿叫DeskMini，看了一下详细介绍，机箱只有 1.9L，甚至比一瓶拉罐可乐大不了多少，嗯，尺寸似乎正合我意！\n但这只是一个机箱 + 主板的准系统，我得自己另行购买 CPU、内存和硬盘。\n挑选了一下，粗略计算了个总价，似乎能控制在 3500 以内，ok，下手！\n\n于是，我就这样用上了人生中的第一台迷你组装机。\n03 装机\n准系统拿下，实际到手价格 909，包含机箱、电源、主板和风扇，另外还有一个无线网卡。\n然后查了不少资料，确定下AMD R5600G这款 CPU，散片 1089 拿下！\n硬盘不用太大，毕竟我有 NAS 服务器，所以，1TB 的铠侠 NVME 固态，527 拿下！\n内存么，之前的电脑都是 16G，剪视频 + 开虚拟机的情况下，有些捉襟见肘，所以，怎么也得上 32G 吧…… 最后，654，拿下两条 16G 镁光 DDR4 3200。\n然后，查了一下自带的无线网卡，最高速度 433 Mbps，岂不是让我的 NAS 毫无用武之地？怎么也处上 2.5G 无线网络吧？\n好的，AX210 无线网卡安排上！拼多多 75 到手！\n所有配件到齐，装机——\n\n不得不说，第一次自己装机，我是真的手残，找了 N 个视频，折腾了两个小时，终于给装上了……\n\n是真的很小，比我 500ml 的茶杯大不了多少，放桌面上毫无违和感。\n04 体验\n然后，重新整理桌面空间、开机、装上 Win11，常用的软件装上，测试视频编码。\n旧的电脑，视频编码 CPU 占用直接狂飙到 100%，这小主机，占用率一起处于 60% 左右。\n内存也一直没用到一半。\n\n真香！\n甚至，几年不玩游戏的我，还特意下载了 Steam，入手了地平线 5……\n没错，集显玩地平线 5！\n\n开低画质（第二档，下面还有极低），挺流畅的，不过没有测试帧率。\n到这一步，我只能说：\n\nAMD Yes!\n\n05 再次折腾\n用了一周之后，我发现一个严重的问题：\n\nCPU 温度时常接近 70 度。\n\n作为一名完美主义者，这能忍？\n所以，我又萌生了换个散热器的想法。\n因为主机太小，所以最高仅支持 46mm 的散热器。\n所以，103，拿下这个规格的利民散热器！\n安装安装安装……\n\n不得不再次吐槽，我手是真的残，换个散热器，又搞了两个钟头……\n而且因为底部螺丝拧得太紧，主板都给干弯了……\n好了，温度果然下降了好几度，舒服了！\n再后来，我又发现，这主机虽小，但扩展性还挺高：居然支持同时插上两块 NVME 硬盘、两块 2.5 寸 SATA 硬盘。\n好的，继续拆！\n把我闲置的 SATA 固态给装上当下载盘。\n不得不说，手残归手残，折腾是真的爽啊！\n06 结语\n后面又买了一些小玩意儿，汇总一下这次折腾的总费用——\n\n3400 不到的一台小主机，既能满足我办公的所有需求，又满足了自己折腾的欲望，何乐而不为呢？\n因为机箱超小的关系，即便淘汰以后，还能做一台 HTPC 或者远程访问主机，多香呀~",

          "description": "如图所示，这满满的一背包现金，是我有生以来第一次摸过这么多钱，大概四十万左右，真的相当有份量。2017 年，我在微博发出这张照片的时候，大家都纷纷羡慕，以为是用来发奖金的，看来少数派是发财了，甚至连银行的营业员都变得十分热情，指望着我多买点理财产品。但实际上，这是我用个人信用担保，借出来的第一笔高额贷款，是用来保障少数派接下来两个月的工资和运营成本。\n这可能就是「钱」的双面性，我们不能只用数量和数字来定夺结论，还要知道钱的来源和用法。很长一段时间，都有很多用户问我们：少数派靠什么赚钱，能赚到钱吗？这可能是理想主义之外，大家最关心的话题，我这里具体说说吧。\n理想中的内容付费\n我们想象中最理想的赚钱方式，当然是「内容付费」，我们从 2013 年就开始给作者发稿酬，从一年 20 万，到现在每年超过 100 万。作者提供有价值的内容，用户为内容付钱，逻辑很简单，但实操非常难。尽管已经十年了，有付费习惯的用户依然是小众群体，而作者分享的内容，也不一定对所以用户都有价值，匹配和触达目标用户的成本也越来越高。\n所以我们先尝试推出了「付费栏目」，把聚焦一个领域的系列内容变成付费阅读，跟软件工具结合，涵盖设计、编程、信息等诸多方法论。我们今年也在迭代栏目，比如以年度为单位，从原来的纯内容付费，增加了在线沙龙、实操任务等更丰富的形式。我们的目的是希望通过这些栏目，帮助用户沉淀和成长。但这毕竟是一种逆反人性的学习模式，付费栏目尽管也做了五年，这部分收入也只能占 10%，并且有大部分收入要分给作者和开发者。\n这期间，能赚钱的付费内容，大多是普世性的，比如缓解时代焦虑的成功学，刺激底层人性网络小说，但从长期价值角度，我们不想也不善于赚这个钱。所以从赚钱层面，我非常不成功，也冒出过放弃的念头。但总有用户会回来告诉我们，通过学习少数派某个栏目，对它的职场和人生带来了重要帮助，此时我们又更加笃定，要坚持做…",

          "description": "今天去参加了飞书在深圳的城市大会，现场聆听谢欣讲了飞书的整体逻辑，组织管理的关键点是文化、制度、工具，前两者都很难改变，只有工具才是最佳切入点。回想起少数派折腾工具，建立团队协作的过程，有一些值得分享的幕后故事。\n\n作为一群研究并推荐工具的年轻人，自然也要真正用上这些「先进」工具，所以我们很早就开始启用 Slack 和 Quip 这些海外工具应用。应该说，海外工具的开放性和创新性，确实给团队协作带来了很多有趣的玩法，穿梭于个各个工具之间，用机器人建立各种自动化流程，避免了很多重复劳动，我们也很快开始为这些工具付费了。\n后来，团队成员慢慢变多，每个新人都要注册一堆海外工具账号，学习成本不断增加，数据风险也开始不可控。我们也不断尝试国内的协作工具，定位和文化的各种原因，确实没法满足团队的需求。\n\n同一时间段，上万人规模的字节跳动，也在经历这个过程，各种折腾之后，他们决定开发自己的团队协作工具——飞书。\n少数派接触飞书其实非常早期。我们一直用媒体资源扶持中小开发者，其中有一个日程工具产品被字节收购，创始人并入了飞书项目组。他作为少数派的资深读者，一直推荐我们关注飞书产品，并且敢打保票，包你满意。\n\n我当时就质问他：你们大公司做项目，经常是壮士断腕，万一市场反馈不好，说停就停了，我们整个团队也跟着白折腾了。\n他说：你放心，字节几万人都靠这套工具运作，每年节省下来的人效成本，都足够养活整个工程部门了，放心大胆用吧。\n\n于是，我们就成了飞书最早期的小客户，虽然那时的产品还有很多小 Bug，但确实保持了其他平台欠缺的开放性和创新性，团队成员直接从海外工具平移过渡，用的顺手，很快就升级付费了。\n我们自己用好之后，还推荐给内容同行们试试，包括小特社区、影视飓风、先看评测等团队都开始尝试和采买飞书，整体反馈也相当不错。\n紧接着，2020 年疫情爆发，大家纷纷开启了远程办公模式，飞书为了帮扶更多中小企业转型线上，下放了整个 Office 的协作功能，开启了阶段性的免费模式，这也带来了很多效率工具的个人用户。\n\n借着这个机会，我们也开始琢磨飞书产品的外部生产力价值。于是，我们将几百人的作者社群，从微信搬到了飞书，用即时通讯模块讨论选题，用飞书文档来约稿创作，用飞书表格来进行内容排期，最后我们还开发了「少数派助手」企业应用，帮助作者把飞书文档上的成稿，一键同步到少数派，并直接发布。飞书不仅解决了内部协作需求，也变成了少数派整个内容创作流程的生产力工具。\n\n转眼两年过去了，飞书从 Office 工具切入，不仅提供了完善的在线文档、多维表格等功能。现在已经开始提供基于人员管理的 People 服务；基于产品研发的飞书项目；基于行政财务的财税综合服务。企业协作体系更加健全了，也开始制定了新的收费策略，价格虽然已经是当年的好几倍，但我们还是选择了付费。\n另一个特别有趣的现象是，我们发现身边有大量的生产制造企业也开始使用飞书，包括安克、飞傲、渴创等等，少数派很多品牌客户、联名合作商，都把微信沟通群迁移到飞书上，用文档讨论项目，用表格处理货品，用飞书开会，大家的效率都得到了提升。\n如今，飞书已经开始服务理想汽车、元气森林、华润等各个领域的中大型企业了，我们却还是一个几十人的小公司，没能跟上时代的大潮，倍感惭愧。但我们在飞书上有数百人的作者群，还有数千人的会员群，他们都是来自各行各业的精英，都在跟少数派一起体验着飞书的产品魅力，这也算是给未来的「先进企业」埋下火种了。\n当然，工具再好，效率再高，也不要了忘了我们追求效率的最终目的，不是攀比谁更狠，谁更卷，而是要把节省出来的时间，更多的放在兴趣爱好和品质生活上，人生不能只活在科技和效率之中，还有广袤的田野和动人的音乐呢。",

We timed over 2,000 readers and the results might surprise you.\nDaniel Doyon | 19 Jul 2022\ntl;dr. Actually no, the results will probably not surprise you. After analyzing data from 2,074 testers, we found no evidence that Bionic Reading has any positive effect on reading speed. In fact, participants read 2.6 words per minute slower on average with Bionic Reading than without. That said, the difference here is so small (less than 1%), that the real takeaway is Bionic Reading has no impact on reading speed.\nIn June 2022, we posted an experiment to Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter to test the claim that Bionic Reading enables you to read faster without any loss of comprehension.\nhttps://blog.readwise.io/bionic-reading-results/",

          "description": "industryhive: \n一提到区块链，所有人都会说区块链是去中心化的，不会被某个人或者某个组织掌控。但是实际情况区块链真的去中心化了么？\n比特币号称是去中心化的，所有节点都能打包区块。但是由于算力的不同，每个节点打包区块的概率是不同的。中国大陆 2019 年的矿池算力占比特币全网算力的 75%，而且这 75%的算力只被前三大矿池掌控。这就意味着，只要这几家矿池聚一块商量一下，就能轻易攻破比特币网络，这还是所谓的“去中心化”么？然后中国镇辅取缔挖矿产业，直接让 75%的算力归零。试想一下，假如中国镇辅想要比特币完蛋，不是取缔，而是收缴全国所有矿机去攻击比特币网络，比特币还能不能存在？\n所以，区块链去中心化在逻辑上就站不住脚，你用家用电脑挖矿，大资本家用专用 ASIC 矿机挖矿，人家一台矿机的算力是你家用游戏显卡的几万倍，你怎么比？由于资本的中心化，必然导致算力的中心化，所以区块链去中心话的逻辑根本就站不住脚。\n除了算力成本，存储成本也很可怕。比特币历史交易数据现在大概是 400GB ，但是随着交易量的增大和时间的推移，历史数据会急剧膨胀，再过十年可能要几个 TB 才，再过 20 年可能要 PB 的容量，这个存储成本会越来越高，必然导致全节点数量越来越少，到最后算力中心化，存储也中心化。比特币完全就成了笑话。\n而且，为了维持去中心化的理念，必须保证节点的数量。但节点数量一多，必然导致全网的交易性能直线下降。要想保证交易性能，必然要采用中心化的措施，自相矛盾。\n所以所谓区块链到底有什么价值？既做不到中心化，交易性能还低，那它存在的意义到底什么？",

Windows端\nWindows端Flutter默认支持窗口化，交互方式基本符合习惯，因此无需再做开发。\n2. Android端\nAndroid普通应用实现窗口化，是把整个应用展示成窗口的效果，但是点击外部窗口外的地方其实是不响应。 同一时间只能显示一个应用进程，这是安卓的机制，也保证了其安全性。要实现窗口化，需要把应用Theme设置成Dialog的样式；同时设置窗口全屏，但是背景色为透明，设置点击外部Dialog不消失，即可实现应用的窗口化展示。\n设置主题\n \n    @drawable…",

          "description": "1、UI自动化测试简介\n软件测试简介\n​软件测试是伴随着软件开发一同诞生的，随着软件规模大型化，结构复杂化，软件测试也从最初的简单“调试”，发展到当今的自动化测试。\n​自动化测试是什么呢？自动化测试是把以人为驱动的测试行为转化为机器执行的一种过程，自动化测试通常会借助某些工具或者框架。虽然不能完全取代手工测试，但相比手工测试来讲，自动化测试可以减少人力成本，降低重复工作，从而更快速、高效的进行测试活动。\n​测试金字塔是一种自动化测试过程的金字塔形策略结构，用来指导软件开发过程中各层测试投入的工作量比例，其最早由Mike Cohn在2009年的著作《Scrum敏捷软件开发》中提出。Mike Cohn在书中指出：测试金字塔从上到下分为三层，分别是UI测试、服务/接口测试、单元测试，越接近金字塔底部的测试活动，投入的工作量应该越多，即单元测试投入工作量最多，接口测试次之，UI测试投入最少。\n\nUI测试\n​UI测试是最接近软件真实用户使用行为的测试类型。通常是模拟真实用户使用软件的行为，即模拟用户在软件界面上的各种操作，并验证这些操作对应的结果是否正确。\n接口测试（API测试）\n​API测试，主要针对的是各模块暴露的接口，通常采用灰盒测试方法。首先以黑盒方式设计如何调用API的测试用例，同时在测试执行过程中统计代码覆盖率，然后根据代码覆盖率情况来补充更多、更有针对性的测试用例。\n单元测试\n​单元测试，属于白盒测试的范畴，通常由开发工程师自己完成，越早发现缺陷其修复成本越低。\n为什么要做 UI 自动化？\n​随着不停的版本迭代，软件新增功能变的越来越多，对测试资源的需求也变得越来越大，执行人工测试的时间越来越长。对于人工测试的依赖开始变得棘手，因此大家开始寻找解决方案，UI 自动化也应运而生。\n人工测试存在以下的弊端：\n人工回归测试需要花费很长时间才能完成，很小的延迟就会让发布面临风险…",

Romanowska hand-builds a vast array of fantastical personas from clay, using a combination of slabs, coils, and molds to form flat tongues, individual teardrops, and horns with pointed tips. The contradictions inherent within the figures’ expressions are the conceptual counterpart to the ceramic material, she says, referring to both its ability to withstand fire and its propensity to fracture or burst upon impact.

Because of the size of the components, the latter technique produces more three-dimensional forms that tend to be fastened with dabs of glue.\nBritish artist T.A.G. Smith employs this assemblage method when sculpting his small bird busts, portraits, and single feathers encased in boxes. Each piece begins with a digital rendering, followed by Smith carving shapes from myriad types of wood, allowing the color and grain of the materials to determine its placement in the final form.

Using cotton and linen threads in neutral tones, the Bellingham, Washington-based artist sheaths smooth stones in impeccably exacting grids. She forms the tiny squares and rectangles with a series of knots, mimicking the loom weaving process but working directly on the natural material. Paired together, the sculptures are finished with a twisting rope wrapped around the circumferences and suspended in staggered positions.\nA few of Fischer’s pieces are available on her site. More",
