Its considered redundant as it adds no information and merely causes visual clutter.\nOvertime comments silently degrade. While code is continuously updated, the comments are forgotten. For a code cryptic in nature, readers turn to the comments to provide an explanation, and when that explanation is false it leaves the readers confused or worse mislead.\n\nThe asterisks in the regex pattern show that  it matches a whole lot more than it was stated by the comments which could be very misleading to the readers who do not bother to check the regex pattern.\nCommenting should be used as a last resort. Every comment serves as a failure to express yourself clearly in code.

          "description": "JavaScript has many quirks and difficult-to-understand behaviors. There are hilarious talks such as WTFJS and WAT that make fun of JavaScript for its strangeness.\nSince I work on refactorings, I have to consider many weird and sometimes funny sides of JavaScript. I will share some of the surprising behaviors that I encounter, so if you see them (which you hopefully never will), it might hint at what's going on.\nThis blog post explores an innocent-looking statement:\n// ... some code\n\nhelloWorld;\n\nYou might intuitively think that nothing should happen here - the statement seems to do nothing because there is no obvious function call here.\nHowever, it can do anything, for example, print \"Hello World!\" to the console.\n// ... some code\n\nhelloWorld;           // prints \"Hello World!\"\n\nHow can this even be possible?\nIt turns out that global variables (in this case, helloWorld) are properties of the global object. And properties in JavaScript do not have to be simple values. They can be implemented using getters and setters, which can execute code. Since the global object inherits from Object.prototype in modern JavaScript engines, adding properties to Object.prototype creates properties on the global object.\nHere, helloWorld is defined as such a getter:\nObject.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {\n  get() { console.log(\"Hello World!\"); },\n});\n\nhelloWorld;           // prints \"Hello World!\"\n\nThankfully this can only happen with global variables, and not with parameters or local variables.\nObject.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {\n  get() { console.log(\"Hello World!\"); },\n});\n\nconst a = helloWorld; // getter is evaluated, prints \"Hello World!\"\na;                    // does nothing\n\nI learned about this strange behavior in a blog post about the globalThis polyfill. In the polyfill, a global property getter is used to access the global this object in different environments such as browsers, web workers, frames, Node.js, and ES modules.

In Python, the community has the saying of something being the “pythonic way”.\nYes, you should embrace “tradition” and make things simpler for everyone... except when you don’t.\nMany React developers out there will start a project and add Redux (or MobX, or Recoil... ) without even thinking if the project will even need it.\nAnd after they do that, since it’s already there it’s easy to just “go with the motion” and just make things in a way to use Redux.\nThere’s this story that you might have heard, it’s about someone trying to learn the family recipe of baking fish and that “you have to cut the tail to make it good” and then they would go from parent to grandparent to ask why you have to make the cut only to be told that it’s “how it’s always been done to make it good”, and finally the great grandparent will say that the oven was too small back in the day and they had to cut it to fit...\nAnd as history repeats itself, if you found anything I’m saying eerie familiar, then yes, more than 10 years ago Uncle Bob wrote that developers would start a project with a database because “you always needed a database right?”.\nRedux is just one of the latest... moment.js, Lodash, jQuery... remember then?\nRemember that the problem is not if you are or not using then, but WHY are you using it.\nCover Photo by Mohit Tomar on Unsplash",

If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.\nIf it’s still could not find the variable, it will either implicitly declare the variable in the global scope (if not in strict mode) or return an error.\nThe Scope Chain is used to resolve variables. When asked to resolve a variable, JavaScript always starts at the innermost level of the code nest and keeps jumping back to the parent scope until it finds the variable …",

The process was really annoying.\nTherefore, we decided to make a website that can allow people share link by simply visit our webpage.\nThis webpage will hold the shared link for 2 minutes, for now, and people can share the link via a share code so other people can access the shared text.\nSteps are very simple:\nShare your text on the website.\nUse the share code to get your text on other devices. If the text contains a URL, website will detect it and extract the link for you.\nWe used NextJS to implement both the frontend and backend API.\nWe opened a free Redislabs account so we can host our cache.\nWe used the free hosting service provide by Vercel.\nWe brought a domain name on Vercel for $70/yr.\nWe don't want to make a cloud storage.\nWe don't want to pay for a cloud storage.\nIn most use cases, this webpage just works like clipboard, so no long term storage is needed.\nWe don't want to pay for a cloud storage.\nPlease feel free to leave your comment!",

Monolith Server Architecture is a thing of the past because we traditionally hosted resources in one environment. This made it versatile, but also heavy and very difficult to update changes.

This command is necessary to see which version of npm you are running. If you don't have it installed, you'll have an error message. If you didn't download npm, don't worry.

Nearly every programming language provides a way for us to develop a simple web server, such as Express.js, Go Gin or Python Flask. However, with the advent of serverless computing, we need to rethink some of the fundamentals of how APIs are developed and deployed. Chiefly:\nTraditionally APIs are packaged into one deliverable; serverless architecture encourages to divide solutions up into many smaller units that are packaged and deployed individually.\nTraditionally APIs are stateful applications that are started and stopped infrequently; serverless architecture encourages to start up compute tasks only on demand.\nIn this article, I will describe a way to develop a serverless API in TypeScript.

          "description": "如今，Apple 全系的 Mac 产品都已经跨入了高分辨率屏幕，最新款的 MacBook Pro 甚至还采用了 mini-LED 技术和 ProMotion 自适应刷新率，为我们带来了笔记本上「天花板级别」一般的显示体验。\n但和 Mac 上高水准的屏幕不同的是，不少人还在用 2K 甚至 1080P 级别的屏幕，忍受着大果粒和小字体带来的麻烦。尽管 Mac 上也有屏幕分辨率调整的选项，但与 Windows 不同的是，Mac 官方仅支持 4K 分辨率以上的屏幕缩放，而 Windows 不仅可以支持各种显示器，还可以自定义缩放的倍数。这也而就意味着，1080P 和 2K 分辨率的显示器，在 Mac 上是无法进行原生的 HiDPI 缩放的，想要实现原生系统级的 HiDPI 支持，最低的条件必须是 4K 显示器。\n\n关于 HiDPI 是什么，这里不再展开介绍，感兴趣的朋友可以在其他地方学习。这里只提一点：即这套 HiDPI 逻辑和早年 Apple 在 Retina 视网膜显示屏开发时有着密不可分的关系。最早的 iPhone 4 实现视网膜显示屏的方式，就是将前代 iPhone 3GS 的 480×320 像素乘以 2，翻倍到了 960×640，并用四个像素渲染一个像素，实现了逻辑分辨率的一致。\n在后来，Apple 一些非视网膜屏幕的产品在升级视网膜屏幕后，也依旧沿用了这个逻辑。例如老款的 MacBook Pro 从 1280×800 升级到视网膜屏幕之后的物理分辨率就变成了 2560×1600，经过 2 倍 HiDPI 缩放之后就和原来的 MacBook Pro 的逻辑分辨率一致了。\n\n在 Intel 时代，我们可以通过一些脚本来实现在 2K 屏幕上的 HiDPI 缩放，以获得更加清晰锐利的显示效果。然而到了 Apple 芯片的 Mac 上，这个方法却失效了。如果想要开启系统的 Hi…",

          "description": "这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：\n1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。\n”盐者，百肴之将“[1]，意思就是盐为\"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。\n同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。\n\n比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。\n比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。\n比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。\n\n\n另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。\n2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性\n人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。\n可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。\n糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。\n3. 盐的可获得性高于糖\n盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。\n大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。\n而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。\n\n综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。\n如果你感兴趣其他关于味觉感官和厨房原理的回答，这里还有一些我回答过其他有意思的问题：\n为什么捏住鼻子就不会尝到味道？\n你是明白了哪几个基本原理之后而厨艺大增的？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n卫小妖GOGOGO\n点击下载\n32 个回答，查看全部。\n有没有替代味精的天然调味品？\n有哪些值得推荐的调味品？",

          "description": "这个题目分为两个方面：\n一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；\n二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。\n1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？\n1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的\n将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。\n最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。\n1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度\n将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。\n如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。\n这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。\n只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。\n下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。\n\n1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果\n至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。\n\n\n\n2.什么样的是好发动机\n热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。\n低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。\n低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。\n高可靠性无需多言。\n两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n广龙先生\n点击下载\n58 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么发动机上最大扭矩不能转化为轮上最大扭矩?\n为什么丰田的2.0发动机有两种功率?",

          "description": "在CES 2022上，索尼公开了第二款概念车VISION-S 0 SUV，而且索尼董事长、总裁兼首席执行官吉田健一郎宣布索尼集团将成立新的部门——索尼移动公司（Sony Mobility Inc），该公司预计在今年春季成立，主要专注于电动汽车商业化。\n\n\nVision-S 02由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队打造，看着看着，这可能成为走向一个新型电动汽车公司的方向么？\n\n\n备注：造车这个事情，戴森走了一轮没走下去。\n\n\n▲图1.Sony的Vision S两款概念车\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\nVision S系列的重点\n\n\n这款概念车是索尼Vision-S由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队来牵头的（机器狗产品Aibo），并且还拉着好几家其他公司来做，包括：NVIDIA、高通、采埃孚、博世（很多部件）、黑莓、QNX、Conti（大量的开发ECU）、本特勒（底盘和电池）、麦格纳（整个EE设计）等等。这个系列最大的特色，还是Vision-S车身内外部署了一套完整的、面向高阶自动驾驶的传感器套件，目的是提供全景影像、360音效、全时连接等特性。\n\n\nSony Vision上的40 个传感器分为：\n16 个 Camera：分为外部8个，分别是环视 4个（IMX390）、侧后摄像头2个（IMX390*2）+、侧视2个（IMX490*2）、内部8个，分别为两个前视立体相机（IMX490*2）、两个ToF 相机（IMX456*2）、驾驶员监控*1、行车记录*1、后摄像头和内部电子个1个、18 个超声波/雷达传感器和 4 个 LiDAR 传感器。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图2.Sony 的Vision S\n\n\n而这台索尼Vision-S的原型车，已经在奥地利参加了公开的路面测试。\n从逻辑上，这是所有参与整个系统构建的一个技术演示，围绕5G技术，可以把诸多感知的电子技术，通过车载系统和云端之间实现高速、高容量和低延迟的连接。也就是说，通过索尼，合作的小伙伴们把VIsion-S打造为一种移动的娱乐空间。\n对于Sony而言，最重要的是需要一个展示的渠道，把Sony在内容、游戏体验和音频上体现出来。通过对VIsion-S的探索，以及合作伙伴的支持，在“移动娱乐空间”这个方向可以有了更多的发展空间。\n\n\n我们仔细研究Sony的业务构成，就能发现索尼已经变成一个围绕游戏机、内容（音乐+电影）的公司。传统上，我们对sony的认知，电子产品只占了1/4不到的业务，而图像传感器CIS是很重要的一块业务。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图3.Sony FY21 Q2的业务构成\n\n\n也就是说，概念车所隶属的Electronics Products & Solutions这个部门，现在已经是一个独立的业务部门。\n从这个意义上来看，Sony和现在苹果的公司结构不一样。苹果可以围绕Apple Car（据说最近苹果抽调了很多资源去做AR和元宇宙了）不停撒钱；Sony肯定和戴森一样烧钱，成立这个业务部门做什么呢？\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图4.索尼的概念车隶属于一个小部门\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\nSony的CIS和激光雷达\n\n\n在Sony科技日展示的内容里面，很重要的一部分就是激光雷达：\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图5.索尼的激光雷达视频\n\n\n有一个重要的背景是，Sony到现在的CIS业务中，在汽车市场里面的占比很低。可以说，索尼的图像传感器CIS部分的新业务开拓，目前还局限在日本车企部分使用，索尼是想通过ADAS领域的需求，能够把自己在移动领域的优势发挥出来。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图6.后疫情时代索尼对于CIS的预测\n\n\n在Vision S系列里面，最多的还是摄像头——这些东西可以作为一个展示给全球汽车企业的方案，并在这个细分市场对安森美进行超越。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图7.Sony的优势CIS领域在汽车里面没做起来\n\n\n\n▲图8.Sony的图像传感器在汽车领域的应用\n\n\n而且一旦有了这个平台，在各项业务和内容中，可以比较容易找到合作伙伴，特别是Sony较少接触的OEM的直接需求——我个人判断这个才是重点，眼下自己去做个汽车公司，完全是得不偿失的事情。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图9.汽车使用的图像传感器，Sony起步较晚\n\n\n\n小结：我个人判断，除了中国和美国，传统欧洲和日本很难出现创业汽车公司，而这两个地方也没有所谓的软件巨头，戴森和Sony这样做产品的公司进入汽车行业也很难赢。\n我想下一步就ADAS摄像头和汽车CIS这个市场进行打开分析，可能效果好一些。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n朱玉龙\n点击下载",

Zynga Poker 是比较稳定流水的产品，这块没太大风险\n2. 休闲品类的能力，可以结合 2K 一些 IP 来做轻度一点的品类，开发周期比较短，靠 IP 加买量也能来一波钱，风险也比较可控\n3. 中重度，应该是看到了收购的工作室 Natural Motions 做的跨端 (移动端 + NS) 4v4 TPS 的 Star Wars: Hunters 品质还比较符合预期，至少能力上是证明了，可以逐步把一些 IP 迁移过去搞中重度收购\n4. 内置的广告系统，手游相互导量，抵消买量的成本\n5. 权益，包括星战和哈利波特 IP 游戏开发权\n\n\n一些想法\n\n马后炮来说，最好当然是过去几年 T2 逐渐收一些手游厂，像 EA 收购 Industrial Toys 或者是自建，比如 Activision Mobile……现在要迅速拉起一块上规模的手游业务，只能收购一些比较成熟的公司\nT2 有点着急了，几款 2K 体育游戏比较稳，但没有可观增量，IP 授权也要给出去一大笔钱；GTA6 还有好几年，别的 IP 比如四海兄弟、江湖本色这些都老化明显，续作比较无力，无主之地的 Gearbox 被 Embracer 卖掉又多了一些未知之数 (虽然 HD 端发行权还是 2K)\n如果能买个国内中型厂是个比较划算的选择，但世界并不是平的\n\n\nMarc\n点击下载\n24 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么R星做游戏这么牛啊？\n真的不懂，R星的游戏到底好玩在哪里？",

          "description": "《让子弹飞》版解读\n\n砸了你们！砸啦！\n兔子都知道不吃窝边草\n三百多个人，转头你们就发布了新车\n还换了名字\n呸！恶心\n我都降价清库存\n这种事儿你们可以花点儿钱嘛\n花点儿\n哪怕送点儿礼品呢\n花不了多少钱！\n哪怕卖期货呢\n简直就是土匪，土匪都不如\n还说让人家车主念你们好\n就是一句话！恶心！\n钱肯定是挣不着啦\n恶心！恶心！\n\n好了，抖机灵结束，回归正题。\n与2021款理想One上市时刚买了老款的车主维权类似，这两件事的背后其实都反映了同一个问题——在脱离了传统的4S店销售模式后，新入局的玩家们如何在销售端处理好新老车型交替。\n问题根源是没处理好车型新老交替时的销售策略\n传统车企是怎么做的\n俗话说“早买早享受，晚买有折扣”。\n以往，传统车企在新款车型上市前夕，一般都会对店内库存的老款车型进行降价促销，用0库存来迎接新车的到来，否则新车上市后老车就砸手里了。\n比如在新款奥迪A3上市前，老款A3的裸车价一度低至14万。\n等新款上市后，初期一直都保持着20万的价格，即使到现在，最低报价也仍然在18万左右。\n因此，虽然新A3相比老A3升级了很多内容，但是买老A3的用户看在6万块的差价上也不会觉得自己亏了。\n当然，也有部分车型销量异常的好，直至生命周期末尾可能都没有优惠，但是这类车待新款上市后往往都需要加价排队提车。\n所以老款还是会比新款便宜。\n新势力们有哪些区别\n但是随着越来越多的新势力入局之后，原先“车厂——4S店；4S店——用户”的交付链路变成了如今的“车厂——直营店/app——用户”。\n车辆的终端售价也由原先“车企和4S店共同决定”变成了现在的“车企单独决定”。\n但是为了保持品牌形象，新势力往往又不会主动选择在老款车型即将停产时降价。\n再加上如今随着电动化、智能化的快速发展，汽车更新换代速度也明显要比以前快得多，消费者根本想不到一台车这么快就会成为老款。\n这两个因素一叠加，在新款上市之际原价买了老款的用户自然觉得自己是被割了韭菜。\n所以对于选择直营的企业来说，如果管理好用户的预期非常重要。\n是不是所有新势力都没处理好？\n也并不是，比如蔚来在这方面我认为还是处理得不错的。\n一方面，蔚来通过“卖期货”这种方式让潜在消费者了解自己在未来半年或一年内的产品发布规划，防止打用户一个措手不及。\n比如蔚来在2021年一月份就发布了ET7，并且开放了预定，而直到2022年1月才启动锁单。\n对于ET7的潜在用户来说，如果在这期间看上了别的车，随时可以退预定金；而对于预定现有NT1.0产品的用户，他们也一定是在权衡了新技术和早提车之后才做出了选择。\n另一方面，虽然蔚来不会主动调整车辆指导价，但是当现有老款车型竞争力不足时，蔚来会采用置换补贴、贴息以及其他商业优惠来变相降价。\n因此，直营并不代表就无法妥善处理新老交替导致的销售问题。\n售后问题\n至于售后，老车主们还真不用太担心，毕竟赛力斯只是改了个名字，运营主体并没有变。\n问界就是赛力斯，赛力斯就是问界。\n\n我是@三斤哥，一个新能源、变速箱、智能网联都有涉足的汽车主机厂工程师。有兴趣的朋友可以关注我，我会从汽车工程师的角度给大家分享相关知识、解读热点问题。\n\n\n三斤哥\n点击下载\n537 个回答，查看全部。\n华为手机售后怎么样？\n华为售后服务怎么样 可不可靠？",

          "description": "常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。\n \n其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。\n\n\nPart 1|咨询前\n 确认专业资质和能力 \n\n1. 教育经历\n 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。\n比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。\n而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。\n\n\n\n国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：\n\n精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；\n临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；\n学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；\n私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。\n\n在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。\n2.执业资格\n除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。\n2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。\n\n\n\n但即便有证书，也…",

          "description": "提前了解一下 Pop!_OS 即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境。仅供参考。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你还不知道，System76 的开发者一直在 致力于开发一个新的桌面环境（被称为 COSMIC），它是用 Rust 编写的，Rust 是一种内存安全的超快编程语言。\n\r\n从头开始创建一个桌面环境不是一件小事。这涉及到创建从合成器、面板、窗口管理器到桌面环境的 API 和其他后端任务的一切。\n\r\n这不是一件容易的事，而维护它又是另一回事。\n\r\n而且，看起来 System76 已经开始了这方面的工作。\n\r\n在 GitHub 上，你会发现已经有一个名为 cosmic 的仓库，但它主要是使用 JavaScript（用于创建 GNOME shell 扩展的语言）编写的。这就是 cosmic shell 扩展仓库，也就是 Pop!_OS 现在所搭载的。\n\r\n在他们的 GitHub 中还有几个较新的仓库，这些恰好是他们即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面的元素。\n\r\n所以，现在是时候构建、测试并提前了解一下了。\n\r\n\r\n注： 澄清一下，目前 Pop!_OS 上基于 GNOME 的桌面环境叫做 COSMIC。而本文讨论的是基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，它是从头开始构建的，旨在取代当前的产品。\n\r\n\r\n基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验\n\r\n打算成为 COSMIC 桌面环境整体一部分的三个仓库是：\n\r\n\r\n设置应用\n\r\n顶部面板（目前用于 X11 系统）\n\r\n合成器（似乎支持原生的 wayland、xwayland 和 X11 系统）\n\r\n\r\nCOSMIC 设置应用\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n注意： 这是一个半生不熟的早期预览，以让你有个大致印象。随着开发的继续，用户界面可能会有根本性的变化。所以，仅用于参考。\n\r\n\r\n这是 Pop!_OS 的新 COSMIC 桌面的设置应用。它目前还在开发当中，没有准备好使用，不过如果你想运行它并试试界面，请随意！\n\r\n那么，它看起来与目前的 COSMIC 体验有什么不同呢？\n\r\n\n\r\n在写这篇文章时，该用户界面似乎没有与任何后端 API 相连接。启用和禁用 “为工作区启用左上角热角 ”的切换并没有什么变化，其他的切换也是如此，除了设置应用的 “关于” 部分所显示的信息。\n\r\n仔细看截图，放置的位置很凌乱，但作为早期预览（或原型）来说也是正常的。\n\r\n看起来他们正在用圆角和更干净的外观来处理一切。\n\r\n切换动画感觉快速、流畅和迅捷（即使是在虚拟机内，我等不及在裸机上尝试）。但考虑到它甚至还没有功能，谈论性能没什么意义。\n\r\n\n\r\n就个人而言，我不喜欢他们所采用的圆角外观。在我看来，GNOME 对圆角的实现是完美的。但是，看看它的结果应该是很有趣的。\n\r\n顶部面板\n\r\n作为 COSMIC 桌面环境的一部分，顶部面板也正在使用 Rust 语言实现。\n\r\n至于这个顶部面板的外观，我不太确定如何测试它才不算对它不公平。从 GNOME 中启动它，会在 GNOME 的顶栏后面打开它。所以我想在一个单独的窗口管理器中打开它（到目前为止只用 bspwm 和 i3-wm 试过），但这导致了一些古怪的行为，比如面板像普通 GUI 软件一样占据了全部垂直空间。\n\r\nCOSMIC 合成器\n\r\nCOSMIC 桌面环境的合成器编译成功了，但在与 bspwm 或 i3-wm 一起使用时却无法启动。我试着在窗口管理器中启动它，因为 GNOME 不允许改变合成器。\n\r\n这是由于在使用 VirtualBox 的虚拟机中，视频驱动的混乱以及 COSMIC 合成器还没有准备好。\n\r\n但是，还有更多！\n\r\n开发者 Eduardo Flores 也尝试了新的 COSMIC 桌面，在他的 博客文章 中分享了一些应用启动器和坞站的截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n应用程序启动器看起来很相似，但是使用 GTK 构建的。同样，你也可以期待 Pop!_OS 21.10 引入一个类似的应用程序库，以及经典的坞站。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n当然，现在说发展的方向还为时过早。\n\r\n要期待一个成熟的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验的测试版，应该还需要一段时间。\n\r\n但是，从我们在这里看到的情况来看，我很兴奋。\n\r\n你怎么看？欢迎你在下面的评论中分享你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/system76-rust-cosmic-desktop/\n\r\n作者：Pratham Patel 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "机器学习方案将帮助不同的无线电协议，如 Wi-Fi 和 LTE，在同一的无线频谱中更有效地协同工作。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）开发的机器学习方案有可能显著改善 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率的方式。研究人员声称，与试错法相比，NIST 的方案可以使共享通信频率的过程的效率提高多达 5000 倍。\n\r\nNIST 系统的理念是，无线电设备可以从经验中学习其网络环境，而不是像现在这样，简单地根据试错法选择频率信道。\n\r\nNIST 在 其网站上的一篇文章 中说，在特定的环境条件下，“该算法可以学习哪个信道提供最好的结果”。\n\r\n该团队说:“该方案可以被编程到现实世界中许多 [不同] 类型网络的发射机软件中。”\n\r\n从本质上讲，这个计算机模拟的算法是一个映射环境射频条件的先前经验的公式。例如，这些条件可以包括在一个信道（一组相邻的频率）内运行的发射机的数量。\n\r\n文章说：“……如果发射机选择了一个未被占用的信道，那么成功传输的概率就会上升，从而导致更高的数据速率。”同样地，当发射机选择一个没有太多干扰的信道时，信号会更强，你也会得到更好的数据速率。发射机会记住哪个信道提供了最佳结果，并学会在下次需要清晰信号时学会选择那个位置。\n\r\n这与今天的工作方式不同。也就是说，无线电只是试图找到一个开放频率，然后与类似协议的无线电进行通信。在复杂的情况下，使用诸如 Wi-Fi、跳频和 波束成形 等技术来优化信道。\n\r\n研究人员解释说，NIST 的机器学习技术的亮点在于共享频谱，比如通过授权频谱辅助接入（LAA）共享 Wi-Fi。LAA 是非授权频谱中的 LTE 频谱，称为 LTE-U，频率为 5GHz。在相同频率下的 Wi-Fi 与 LAA 的组合中，协议是不同的：无线电之间不能相互通信以协调工作，而且频带越繁忙就可能出现混乱 —— 传输会遇到其他传输。但是，如果所有的无线电接收机都能更好地选择它们的占位，通过学习哪些有效，哪些无效，那么这将会更好。\n\r\nNIST 工程师 Jason Coder 在文章中说：“这可能会使非授权频段的通信更加高效。”\n\r\n事实上，NIST 声称，它“可以帮助 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率，其效率大约是试错法的 5000 倍。”\n\r\n这里的关键词是“共享”，因为为了在有限的频谱内增加通信，必须进行更多的共享 —— 物联网或媒体流等用户都在争夺同样的隐喻资产。随着物联网和数字技术的不断发展，非授权和授权频段的结合，就像 LAA 中的情况一样，可能会变得更加普遍。（非授权的频段是指那些没有分配给特定用户的频段，比如移动网络运营商；授权频段是在拍卖中中标并分配的。）\n\r\n在 NIST 场景中，相互竞争的发射机“各自学习在不相互通信的情况下最大化网络数据速率”。因此，多种协议和数据类型，如视频或传感器数据，或 Wi-Fi 和移动网络，可以相互协作。\n\r\nNIST 的方案大大简化了为发射机分配最佳信道的过程，根据这篇文章研究发现，穷尽努力 [使用试错法] 来确定最佳解决方案需要大约 45600 次试验，而这个方案只需要尝试 10 个渠道就可以选择类似的解决方案，仅仅付出 0.02% 的努力。”\n\r\nNIST 的研究人员在 IEEE 第 91 届车辆技术会议上展示了他们的研究成果。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3561618/nist-aims-to-make-frequency-sharing-more-efficient-for-wireless-networks.html\n\r\n作者：Patrick Nelson 选题：lujun9972 译者：CN-QUAN 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "无论你是在家庭实验室里试验 Kubernetes，还是想成为一个成为 Kubernetes 的维护者，这里都有适合你的资源。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n2021 年对于 Kubernetes 来说是令人兴奋的一年，这些文章证明了这一点。从有趣的界面到家庭实验室再到开发环境，看看我在 2021 年最喜欢的 K8s 文章。\n\r\n如果你对基本原理感兴趣，这篇 介绍 Linux 上的容器 的文章从内到外阐明了 Linux 容器的工作原理。你是否想获取一些乐趣？安装 minikube 并开始使用 DOOM 游戏作为界面 来管理它。另一个选择是 kubectl，这是一个更传统的 Kubernetes 控制 CLI。\n\r\n即使你只在你的 Linux 家庭实验室 上运行 Kubernetes，你也可以使用 Terraform 和 Helm 等工具来自动化日常操作。这创造了一个 更好地掌握 Terraform 的机会。\n\r\n生活中可以确定的几件事之一是，计算机会以奇怪而有趣的方式出错。用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 监控你的 Kubernetes 集群，看看它是如何出错的。使用 Grafana Tempo 的分布式跟踪来监控里面运行的应用。通过引入 Chaos Mesh 在 Kubernetes 中造成有意的混乱，来监控你监控的性能。\n\r\n如果你正在开发在 Kubernetes 上运行的应用，Quarkus 可以帮助你开发和测试。使用 Java 的开发者 可以在 Kubernetes 上使用容器运行 应用。像 Tackle-DiVA 这样的工具有助于将应用移植到容器中。\n\r\n像所有成功的开源项目一样，Kubernetes 的部分价值是一个强大的 生态系统。比如 KubeEdge 项目，它有助于将计算和数据更接近终端用户。在使用 Kubernetes 一段时间后，你甚至可能想 成为 Kubernetes 维护者。\n\r\n有这么多有趣的 Kubernetes 内容可供学习，可能很难将它们全部看完。不过，对于系统管理员和开发人员来说，优秀的 Kubernetes 资源是必须的。请阅读这些精选的内容。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/12/learn-kubernetes-2022\n\r\n作者：Moshe Zadka 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "我知道对于圣诞愿望清单来说已经太晚了，但我仍然想分享我希望在 GNOME 中看到的东西。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME 是许多 Linux 发行版的默认桌面环境。它也是我最喜欢的一个，因为它提供了一种现代的桌面体验。\n\r\n但这并不意味着 GNOME 是完美的，不需要改进。事实上，这里有几个建议可以改善整个用户体验。\n\r\n1、方便的应用程序卸载选项\n\r\n桌面 Linux 是碎片化的。为了增加混乱，连软件包也是零零散散的。而最糟糕的是当你从系统中删除一个应用程序时。\n\r\n举个例子，你要通过 DEB 包安装一个应用程序，并使用 GNOME 软件中心界面来安装它。\n\r\n但如果你不喜欢这个应用程序，想把它删除呢？\n\r\n你不会在软件中心中找到该应用程序。相反，你得必须使用命令行的方法。\n\r\n这还没完。还有 Snap 和 Flatpak 软件包。如果你已经使用了其中之一，你必须先找出来，然后使用正确的命令才行。\n\r\nGNOME 采用了类似于 Android/iOS 的方法，将应用程序显示在一个网格中，并将它们组织在文件夹中。移动操作系统为用户提供了一种方式，即按住图标并删除应用程序。如果能有一个类似的选项，右键点击应用程序图标并选择卸载，那就更好了。\n\r\n\n\r\n这样，终端用户就不用管所安装的应用程序是 Deb 包还是 Snap 包。没有必要为此进入终端，而且它就发生在访问应用程序地方，这不是挺好吗？\n\r\nLinux Mint Cinnamon 版有这样的功能，你在菜单中右键点击一个应用程序条目，选择删除它。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果 Cinnamon 能做到，GNOME 应该也能做到，对吗？\n\r\n2、在应用程序商店中设置默认软件源\n\r\n如果一个应用程序有多种格式，GNOME 软件中心可以让你选择软件源。至少这是我在 Fedora 的 GNOME 软件中看到的，但在 Ubuntu 中没有。\n\r\n\n\r\n假…",

          "description": "开源开发者自毁其广泛使用的依赖库\n\r\n开源库 colors.js 和 faker.js 被广泛使用。在 NPM 上，colors.js 的周下载量超过 2000 万次，有近 19000 个项目依赖它。前几天，它的开发者在这些库的最新版本中加入了无限循环和乱码，依赖它的项目会在控制台看到不停打印的非 ASCII 字符。他将这两个库的 自毁版本 推送到了 GitHub 和 NPM，因而导致多个使用这些依赖库的软件出现故障，其中包括亚马逊的 AWS CDK。这位开发者似乎是因为没有得到使用他的开源软件的大公司的 付费，而专门做了这种破坏。这件事引来了业界和社区的激烈讨论。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我认为，你可以因没有得到报酬而放弃项目，但是这不是你蓄意报复的理由。如果一开始就想着获益，请发布你的商业版本。这种最初遵循开源许可证和开源文化的开源软件，在邀名不成、获利不得后恼羞成怒地大肆破坏，或许没有违反许可证和法律，但是却给整个开源文化泼了一盆脏水。我对这种行为持反对意见。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMozilla 基金会其实从 2014 年就开始接受加密货币捐款\n\r\n之前我们报道过，Mozilla 基金会官方 Twitter 账号在 1 月 1 日提醒粉丝它接受加密货币，如比特币、以太坊的捐款，但这一声明招致了 猛烈批评，最终迫使 Mozilla 基金会宣布 暂停 接受加密货币捐款。但实际上 Mozilla 基金会从 2014 年就开始 接受加密货币捐款，当时 Mozilla 还列举了其它接受加密货币捐款的组织，如可汗学院、电子前沿基金会、绿色和平组织和维基媒体基金会。到今天，只有绿色和平组织停止接受加密货币捐款。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：加密货币是否该死，我觉得不能用政治正确来评判。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWindows 11 上仍能使用软驱和软盘\n\r\n去年发布的 Windows 11 系统，调整了硬件安装需求，很多硬件都不再支持，需要使用较新的 CPU 和 TPM 2.0 等等。但是，有用户发现，Windows 11 上居然还可以成功使用索尼 5.25 寸软盘。这意味着，Windows 11 对外部设备还保留了不错的兼容性。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 5.25 寸、3.5 寸软盘已经基本退出历史舞台，可在特定领域依然有用武之地，但这个反差让我有些吃惊。",

          "description": "有 几个可用于 Linux 的截图工具，我喜欢 使用 Flameshot 进行截图 和 Shutter 来编辑现有的截图。\n\r\n但不幸的是，Flameshot 不能在 4K 屏幕上工作。因此，我不得不使用默认的 GNOME 截图工具，它在我的带有超高清屏幕的戴尔 XPS 上工作得非常好。\n\r\n\n\r\n这一“被迫之举”让我意识到，如果你知道如何正确使用，GNOME 截图 并不是一个糟糕的工具。\n\r\n在这里，我指的是用键盘快捷键来使用它，因为这样可以节省大量的时间。\n\r\n让我展示一下如何像专家一样用那些方便的键盘快捷键来使用 GNOME 截图应用。\n\r\n我假定你没有改变这里的默认的截图的键盘快捷键。\n\r\n对整个屏幕进行截图：使用 Prt Scr 键\n\r\n这是最简单的操作。在你的键盘上找到 Prt Sc（或称 Prt Scr、Prt Scn）键并按下它。它将对整个屏幕进行截图，并将其保存在你的主目录下的图片文件夹中。\n\r\n\n\r\n在某些发行版（或版本）中，你可能会看到是否要保存截图的选项，但大多数情况下，它会自动保存屏幕截图。\n\r\n这里需要注意的另一件事是，如果你有多个屏幕连接到系统上，它会把所有的屏幕一起截图。这意味着，你会得到一个超宽的图像。\n\r\n但是，如果你只想对某个应用进行截图，而不是对整个屏幕进行截图呢？\n\r\n给一个应用程序的窗口截图：使用 Alt+Prt Scr 键\n\r\n要给正在运行的图形应用截图，你需要这样做：\n\r\n点击正在运行的应用，使其获得焦点。现在，按住 Alt 键并按 Prt Scr 键。\n\r\n它将得到应用窗口的截图，并保存到图片目录中。\n\r\n\n\r\n这样获取的截图也有一个阴影效果，看起来很不错。\n\r\n这很好，但如果你只想给某个特定区域截图，而不是整个屏幕呢？这也有一个技巧。\n\r\n对屏幕的选定区域进行截图：使用 Shift+Prt Scr 键\n\r\n按住 Shift 键。然后按 Prt Scr 键。你会看到屏幕上出现一个选框。将鼠标移动到所需的区域，开始拖动光标。它将高亮显示该区域，并在你释放鼠标后立即进行截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n复制截图到剪贴板而不是保存它们\n\r\n当你在和别人聊天时，要和对方分享屏幕截图时，这非常有用。\n\r\n\n\r\n首先截图，但没必要将保存的截图文件附在聊天工具中。相反，你可以直接将截图复制到剪贴板，然后使用 Ctrl+V 快捷键将图像（从剪贴板）粘贴到聊天工具。\n\r\n这样，你的系统就不会保留不必要的截图，你也可以节省一些鼠标点击次数。\n\r\n要把截图保存到剪贴板，以便你能把它们粘贴到聊天工具、绘图工具或文档中，你必须把 Ctrl 键和你在前面几节中看到的其他截图快捷键一起使用。\n\r\n\r\nCtrl+Prt Scr：将整个屏幕的截图复制到剪贴板上。\n\r\nCtrl+Alt+Prt Scr：将应用窗口的截图复制到剪贴板上。\n\r\nCtrl+Shift+Prt Scr：将选定区域的截图复制到剪贴板上\n\r\n\r\n我必须补充一点，在这种情况下，使用像 Flameshot 这样的工具 甚至更好一些，因为它允许你在将截图保存到剪贴板之前对其进行注释。这样，你可以很容易地高亮屏幕的重要部分。\n\r\n在截图中添加延迟，以便对下拉菜单进行截图\n\r\n到目前为止，一切都很好。你只需按下几个键，就可以随心所欲地进行截图了。\n\r\n问题是，当你要对下拉菜单或右键动作等进行截图时。当你按下屏幕截图键时，想要的项目可能会消失。\n\r\n为了处理这种情况，你可以对该区域或整个屏幕进行截图，但要有一个延迟。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 GNOME 屏幕截图工具中，你可以选择添加这个延迟。例如，你添加了 6 秒的延迟。你点击截图按钮，有 6 秒时间来做/显示你想做的事情。6 秒后，它就会自动截图了。\n\r\n你有什么技巧吗？\n\r\n这就是我使用 GNOME 截图工具的所有技巧。如果你还没有广泛地使用它，你应该会发现它很有帮助。如果你已经是一个专家，也许你知道一些可以添加到本文中的东西？请在评论区与我们其他人分享吧。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/using-gnome-screenshot-tool/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "写在前面\n老实说这篇年终总结一开始写得并不顺利，一直没有什么好的思路。\n简单回忆了一下 2021 年经历的几件大事：跳槽、离职旅行、搬家、爷爷去世。现在心境相比 2021 年初已经有了很大的改变，可能这就是所谓的「成长」吧。\n这次打算用「重新认识自己」——「继续热爱生活」——「做自己」——「变优秀」——「学会和自己和解」来组成这篇年终总结。\n重新认识自己\n工作\n在 2021 年的 6 月我结束了毕业后的第一份工作，选择从国企离职，进入了一家互联网公司。国企与互联网带给我的工作体验是完全不一样的，详情写在了这里：从国企到互联网，一个初入职场将近一年半工作经验程序员的「得」与「失」。\n但在新公司待了快半年，意识到其实自己也不喜欢现在的这份工作。因为带自己的 mentor 被裁，导致自己平时工作遇到难点几乎找不到同事寻求帮助，一而再地受到打击，得不到工作上的成就感，渐渐地自己开始厌倦现在这份工作以及这个职业。其实自己也知道，又有多少人真正喜欢工作呢，打工还不是为了混口饭吃。但是我觉得自己还年轻，还想多尝试尝试。\n想起来之前和一位朋友讨论过职业规划的问题，我觉得大部分人没有一定阅历是规划不出什么的，因为不知道自己真正喜欢的是什么，但是不规划怎么又能有丰富的阅历做支撑呢。我觉得这是一个悖论，唯一的解决方法是有一个你信得过且对你很了解的前辈告诉你应该选什么方向做什么类型的工作，但是这样就不是自己的人生了。\n比如我之前在国企，做的是 ToG 相关的工作，经历过后发现一点也不喜欢条条框框的限制。现在在一家互联网公司做内部系统开发，氛围很自由，只是当前的工作内容并不太喜欢。\n但依然没有想好自己真正想做什么，可能还是不敢勇敢迈出那一步吧。还需要多找些行业前辈进行交流与请教，过来人的经验真的很有用。最近和一位做产品的朋友交流，意识到各行各业都没有外人看上去那么光鲜亮丽，不要抱有太高的期望，结果往…",

          "description": "在使用飞书以前，我是如何网络授课的\n2020年一月，一场疫情将人类社会冻结。工作冻结、生活冻结。人们被关在家里没法出门，也不能参与到工作当中。也正是因为这样，催生出了「远程办公」这样的模式，让一直不被大家重视的「协同办公」走到了历史的舞台最前方，展现出了不一样的魅力。\n传统的协同办公，自然要提到 Google Workspace 这个远程协同办公的老大哥。在日本的公司里，经常需要讨论教案或者上课的一些新方法，有些时候需要整理成文档。公司有订阅 Workspace ，所以我们都在其上面讨论或者通过文档来交流对于教案的看法。\n同样因为疫情受到影响的，还有我们上课的流程。以往都是线下面授课，疫情期间全部改为用 Zoom 给学生上网课，这个时候就涉及到了板书问题。线下可以写在白板上，线上怎么办呢？在使用飞书以前，我的解决办法是用 iPad 加入会议，然后再用 iPad 来共享屏幕进行板书。这样确实很方便，却也存在一个不可调和的问题——画面同步差到极致。往往一个流畅的书写过程被卡顿的屏幕共享硬生生切成了三个分解动作；往后流畅地翻页被其分解成了 PPT 没有过度特效的翻页。\n总之，一切的一切，都迫使我停止使用 iPad 来作为板书工具，并且急需一个替代品。这个代替品既能起到「板书」的作用，同时还能兼顾 PDF 阅读器的职能。最好还能在 PDF 文件上做标记。\n开始尝试使用飞书\n需求有了，接下来就是对比市面上的产品了。学生年龄在初中阶段，用 Coda 或者 Worspace 不太合适，他们可能并没有太多精力去研究这两个东西到底怎么用；用 Notion 的话导入 PDF 又非常不便； iPad 更是不再考虑，它最多只能作为一个辅助性的工具。\n找到飞书是个巧合，完全是在研究工作流的时候碰到了飞书，并且被这个远程办公的模式启发，觉得可以用在我的课堂上。说干就干，于是我从本地将我目前保留的教案全…",

          "description": "CloudStorage: \n前言\n随着业务规模的不断扩大，企业越来越重视构建高性能、高可用的大型分布式系统。为了解决应用耦合，合理进行流量削锋，腾讯云提供了包括 CKafka 和 TDMQ 在内的一系列消息队列中间件。为了更方便地对消息队列中的数据进行转存和持久化，腾讯云对象存储 COS 为用户提供了云消息队列备份的能力。\n一、云消息队列备份方案-使用 COS 应用集成备份\nCOS 应用集成 是腾讯云对象存储 COS 基于 Serverless 云函数，为开发者提供的存储数据应用解决方案。开发者只需要在 COS 控制台一键配置，即可使用丰富的功能。\nCOS 应用集成提供了云消息队列备份的能力，开发者可以轻松配置定时备份任务，将云消息队列中的消息记录以文件的形式转至对象存储，以便进行持久化保存。开发者可以通过备份文件提取消息记录，对消息进行入库、统计分析等操作。\n\n二、方案优势\n存储成本低：对象存储支持数据归档和降冷，长期存储成本低；\n可视化操作：一键配置，简化开发流程，无需编码工作；\n指定范围：可指定消费的起始位置，排除不需要的记录；\n消息聚合：可按分钟维度聚合消息记录，并支持修改时间粒度；\n自动化执行：云函数自动完成云消息队列 CKafka / TDMQ 的数据备份，中间过程无需任何人工操作；\n三、云消息队列介绍\n**消息队列 **CKafka （ Cloud Kafka ）是一个分布式、高吞吐量、高可扩展性的消息系统，100%兼容开源 Kafka API 0.9.0 至 2.8.0 版本。CKafka 基于发布订阅模式，通过消息解耦，使生产者和消费者异步交互，无需彼此等待。CKafka 具有数据压缩、支持离线和实时数据处理等优点，适用于日志压缩收集、监控数据聚合等场景。\n**消息队列 TDMQ **（ Tencent Distributed Message Queue ）是腾讯基于 Apache Pulsar 自研的一个云原生消息中间件系列，其中包含兼容 Pulsar 、RabbitMQ 、RocketMQ 等协议的消息队列子产品，得益于其底层计算与存储分离的架构，TDMQ 具备良好的弹性伸缩以及故障恢复能力。\n四、备份任务设置步骤\n这里以设置 CKafka 消息备份任务为例，TDMQ 设置与之相似：\n登录腾讯云 对象存储 COS 控制台。\n在左侧导航中，单击 [应用集成] ，找到 [ CKafka 消息备份] 。\n单击 [配置备份规则] ，进入规则配置页面。\n单击 [添加函数] 。注意：如果您尚未开通云函数服务，请前往 云函数控制台 开通云函数服务，按照提示完成服务授权即可。\n在弹出的窗口中，配置如下信息：\n\na.函数名称：作为函数的唯一标识名称，创建后不可修改（您可以在云函数控制台上查看该函数）。\nb.关联存储桶：存放 CKafka 消息的 COS 存储桶。\nc.时间粒度：根据消息量的大小，选取汇聚消息的时间间隔，时间间隔为 5 - 15 分钟不等。为保证转存性能，聚合文件数量与 Partition 数量、partition_max 设置数值有关。有关 Partition 的说明，请参见分区。\nd.SCF 授权：CKafka 消息备份需要授权云函数从您的 CKafka 服务中读取相关实例消息，并将消息转存至您指定的存储桶中。因此需要添加此授权。\n6.单击 [下一步] ，进行 CKafka 配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.实例选择：选择消息来源的 CKafka 实例，仅支持同地域的 CKafka 实例。\nb.主题选择：选择消息来源的主题。\nc.起始位置：消息转储备份时历史消息的处理方式，topic offset 设置。\nd.访问地址：必须为 VPC 内网访问地址，基础网络的 CKafka 实例请添加路由策略，具体请参考 添加路由策略。注意：对应的 VPC 子网中必须有可用的 IP ，且必须支持 DHCP 。\n7.单击 [下一步] ，进行投递配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.投递的路径：备份文件的投递路径前缀，不填写则默认保存在存储桶根路径，指定前缀必须以斜杠 “ / ” 为结尾。\n8.添加配置后，单击 [确认] ，即可看到函数已添加完成。\n\n五、查看备份文件\n等待一段时间后，可以看到存储桶下投递了备份文件，其内容的每行代表一条消息记录。\n\n\n\n好了，本期关于云备份方案将分享到这里，欢迎点击“链接”，查看更多云消息队列备份攻略。",
