In Ruby, we use destructuring to conveniently extract multiple values from data stored in Arrays or Hashes. It provides a way for us to group or ungroup data and assign them to variables where needed. \nIn this article we’re going to discuss destructuring for assignments, arrays and keyword args. We’ll also touch on why you would utilize destructuring.\nThe most straightforward form of destructuring is through multiple assignments. This form of destructuring assigns the variables on the left to the values on the right in the order that they are provided. \nAs an example:\na, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n\na => 1 \nb => 2 \nc => 3 \n\nIn the above example the variables on the left are assigned to the values on the right…",

At this juncture, the only best way to manage secrets is to use the dotenv package.\nso, you can easily install it using npm or Yarn as follows:\nnpm install dotenv\nyarn add dotenv\nThen, create a .env file at the project root and define all the secrets in that file.\nNODE_ENV= develpment,\nMONGODB_URL = \"mongodb_url:uerbsf@kgeyfdop_jhf\"\nPORT = 3000\nUSERNAME=secret123\nPASSWORD=secret123@\n\nFinally, you can require and use these secrets in the application like below:\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nmongoose.connect({\nhost: process.env.PORT,\nusername: process.env.MONGODB_URL,\npassword: process.env.PASSWORD\n})\n\nMost importantly, make sure to include .env files in the .gitignore file to prevent them from being pushed to the Git repository.",

          "description": "Code reviews are the glue of any effective software engineering team. A code review is the stage at which an engineer requests their changes to be merged into the main development branch. During a code review, other teammates and senior leadership can comment on and suggest changes to your code through version control systems such as Git and GitLab.\nCode reviews are the inflection point from an individual engineer’s changes into a team-wide contribution towards a central code base.\nThe most important piece of code reviews lies within this transition. Code reviews start with individual ownership from one or two developers and end with team ownership. Once that code has been merged, any future bugs or problems are not an individual’s problem — they are a team problem.\nIn the age of fully rem…",

I’ve been learning a lot of Big O Notation and TDD\nBig O notation is a mathematical notation used to classify the complexity of  your algorithm. This complexity includes the running time and the space that allocates in memory, O(1) has the least complexity let’s say that you’re working with a sort algorithm and you get constant complexity this algorithms is very optimized. Otherwise if you got a O(2^n) your algorithm is horrible optimized. As developers it is important to have knowledge of Big O Notation  to implement on code an optimized solution. \nTDD (Test driven development) is a style of programming  following three main activities: coding, testing and design it specifies and validate how code should works and what will do . In this case when we’re talking about the testing part we refer to unit testing and at design includes refactoring elements.\nUnit testing is a method in which a single component of code is tested, including the expected behavior and taking on mind the edge cases. The purpose of unit testing is validate if the unit works correctly this type of testing is considered the first level of sofware testing\nIntegration testing, on the other hand, is a method in which a group of units are tested in a group in this case normally components depend on other components and both work together. Integration testing is  used to check the functionality, performance and expected behavior of the system.\nOn the next weeks I’ll continue working on solving hacker rank challenges and practicing some CS fundamentals in order to be prepared for my technical interview.",

It is the practice of running tests on software or websites with minimal human interaction. It's the most effective way to ensure that your code is tested in a consistent and repeatable manner, which improves the quality of your software applications and allows you to fix problems or avoid mistakes that would otherwise be difficult to detect manually. Because it allows for repeatable and consistent results over time, automation testing is more efficient than manual testing.\nWith Testsigma, a powerful open source test automation platform for web apps, mobile apps, and APIs, you can build stable and reliable end-to-end tests at DevOps speed!\nFor those who want to know more about how Testsigma is simplifying test automation, we are delighted to have Rukmangada Naidu & Amit Wadekar from the team for an AMA Session.\nRukmangada Naidu (aka KR): KR is the founder and CEO of Testsigma, an open-source and codeless test automation platform for testers worldwide. KR started Testsigma as a cloud-based test automation platform with the vision of simplifying test automation for everyone. Testsigma's open source community edition has been launched, too, increasing the scope of its application and usability.\nAmit Wadekar: Amit is the Director of Key Account Management at Testsigma. He drives multiple teams like Pre-sales/Technical Sales, Account Management, Customer Success, and QA for the organization.\nThe basics of test automation\nVarious tools in the testing ecosystem\nMonetizing open-source products\nTracking the growth of open source products\nComparison with other test automation alternatives\nOpportunities to contribute and the rewards\nThe roadmap of Testsigma\nFeel free to ask any questions you have in the discussion thread below!

Choosing an appropriate architecture for communication between the server and clients plays a significant role in ensuring that traffic is kept at a manageable level.\nIn this article, you’re going to learn about the push and pull architecture of network communications, and how push architecture can limit the load on your application server, increasing performance.\nThere are two primary approaches to network communications—push and pull.\nPull: Often referred to as polling, it’s especially common on the internet.

This is especially important when working on a team, as it allows everyone to see what changes have been made and who made them. Good commits should be clear and concise so that they are easy to understand. Second, commits should be atomic, meaning that each commit should only contain one change. This makes it easier to revert changes if necessary. Finally, good commits should be made regularly so that the project history is easy to follow.\nWrite clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages.

To use a generics feature, the any keyword can be used to define all data types that can be used as a parameter in a function or a struct. The other keyword that can be used is comparable which means the data type that implements comparable like int and float64.\nThis is an example of generics usage in a function.

And, you are not wrong but it's a part of it. Let's define it formally.\nRootkit is a program that can hide itself as well as other running processes, files, network connections from the host where it is running.\nThe main goal is to run incognito meaning running in the background for as long as it is possible.\nIt aims to hide the traces of intruder by manipulating processes, open files, network activity, changing access rights/permission of different files and directory.\nOne of the main goal of rootkit is to make sure that intruder have full remote access to the victim's computer all the time. For e.g: rootkit may establish a backdoor using ssh tunneling.\nIt also enables attacker to wiretapping and intercepting various system components may be sending data to a particular end point or installing a keylogger.\nThe biggest challenge that also differentiate rootkit from other types of malware is the fact that rootkit need to be installed with root privileges in the first place.\nUser-mode rootkit: A user-mode rootkit covertly replaces common UNIX binaries or libraries with infected versions to hide its existence and to gain root privileges if needed.\n\n\nKernel-mode rootkit: A kernel-mode rootkit operates on the system level and modifies or replaces the kernel which may have been affected in the boot process.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good blog on Linux boot process.",

This included popular services like:\nGoogle Search\nYouTube\nGmail\n\nThe problem for Google, which was not the profit-making machine we know today, was finding a way to offer these free services without tanking the business.

I love that it's short, I can solve one word and then it's gone. I don't feel too bad about the addiction and wasting my time with a game. This cloud debugger tutorial is an enormous challenge for me since the target is a Wordle game. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\nAs part of the Lightrun Playground we recently released we needed a demo application that will let developers who are new to Lightrun, practice in a \"safe environment\".We decided to pick Wordle as our demo application because it's instantly familiar, visual and not too interactive. A Flappy Bird demo might have been painful to debug. At this point our key challenge was in creating a bug where the debugging process…",

How does Google know which blog to redirect to?\nIf you don't provide a canonical tag, Google might even think you are spamming the internet and not showing any of the three sites!\nHowever, you can use this canonical tag to set which site is the primary source for this article.\nSo what do I do, you ask?\nSo how do we set these canonical URLs\nIf you are not using a custom website as your primary source, you can set the canonical URL by adding the following tag in your HTML head.\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://daily-dev-tips.com/your-article-name\" />\n\nThis will tell the search engines they can find the original content on the address you provide there.\nMost blogging platforms offer a more visual way of adding these canonical tags.\nFor instance, on Hashnode, they have the following widget in the sidebar.\n\nAnd the same kind of graphical element exists on dev.to.\n\nA small side note is that my good friend Graham suggests you wait two weeks before reposting your content.\nThis is, in theory, true.\nReposting content is a great way to reach a broader audience, but it can hurt your SEO if you don't use canonical tags.\nDo use canonical tags to indicate to search engines which is your original content.\nDo not mix the canonicals to link to different articles from different sources.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "I recently came across a twitter post where the user challenged others if they knew the difference between the js methods .slice() and .splice() without googling them. A lot of people mixed them up.\nSo I've created this simplified cheat sheet of everything you need to know about the 2 methods.\n.slice() and splice() are both array methods. \n\n\nboth of them return arrays as outputs\n\n\nthe key is to pay attention the what they return as the output array and if they mutate the original array (they one on which the were applied to)\n.slice() returns selected elements in an array, as a new array. Selection is done by index.\n\n\n.slice() does not affect the original array\n\n\n\nWith splice() you can select one or more elements. \nFor example: This code snippet returns 3 (which is at index 2)\n[1,2,3,4,5].slice(2) // returns 3 (which is at index 2)\n\nand this code snippet returns 2,3,4 (from index 1 to 4 exclusively)\n[1,2,3,4,5].slice(1,4) // returns 2,3,4 (from index 1 to 4 exclusively)\n\n.splice modifies the original array (adds and/or removes elements from the array)\n\n\nThe method returns the original array **modified**\n\n\n\nWith splice you can:\n remove elements\n\n\n\n\n[1,2,3,4,5].splice(3) // returns [1,2,3] (first 3 elements)\n[1,2,3,4,5].splice(2,2) // at position 2 remove 2 elements (returns [1,2,5])\n\n add elements\n\n\n\n\n\n[1,2,5].splice(2,0,3,4) // at postion 2 add 2 elements (returns [1,2,3,4,5])\n\n\n remove and add elements at the same time\n\n\n\n\n// at position 2, remove 1 elements and add 2 new items\n[1,2,3,4,5].splice(2,2,\"HTML\",\"CSS\") // returns [1,2,\"HTML\",\"CSS\",5]\n\nRemember: .splice() mutates the array, .slice() does not!\nHope this is helpful to someone 💜",

They provide a high performance way to query relational data across many different axis.\n\nHowever, SQL databases have problems scaling which is why most companies eventually find themselves moving off SQL solutions and onto NoSQL alternatives. So why don't SQL databases scale?\nSQL databases rely on structured data and foreign keys to connect data. This is an extremely performant way to manage data and lets you link data across the whole database with simple queries using SELECT and JOIN.\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID\nFROM Customers\nLEFT JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID\nORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;\n\nIn order for a database to join data this way it n…",

I am convinced that every individual contributor arrives at the point of getting larger-than-oneself ideas and wanting to use the insight they accumulated through technical work to lead teams. \nFor years, management seemed a logical next step for a developer’s career, up to the point of a strongly-held belief that getting a manager’s title is a “promotion”. Only after having made an engineer-manager transition myself, I am confident this is false.\nWhen you are a manager, you stop being an active contributor or have to cut your workload and give up challenging tasks.

Up until now we discussed tools that are very low level. Some can be used to debug system level services. Today we’ll discuss the other side of the stack but still a very advanced management tool. To understand this you need to understand the field we’re in.\nAs developers we deal with code and applications. Deployment is for OPS/DevOps and the tooling they use is often alien to us. It’s not that they have bad tools. On the contrary, they have amazing tools. But they’re usually designed for massive scale.

This one would help you with partitioning block devices in Linux. The tool is called LVM and this article would be an introduction for that. Without further delay, let's start.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia;\nIn computer storage, logical volume management or LVM provides a method of allocating space on mass-storage devices that is more flexible than conventional partitioning schemes to store volumes. In particular, a volume manager can concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine partitions (or block devices in general) into larger virtual partitions that administrators can re-size or move, potentially without interrupting system use\n\nConfused?

It's that entity/being that makes sure that your code does not function the same way in your local, development and production environments. Well, he's a gnome and is called Bob Stinkycode.\nI imagine he looks something like this after he's messed with you:\n\nLet's see an example: you've been working on a feature for a while, you've tested and everything works perfectly. Then the code is deployed to a real environment and some part of the feature that worked and had been tested extensively before does not work. You check and double check and crap, theoretically it should work, you can't explain why the hell it's failing... and of course your code is perfect and the only posible explanation is that the Bob has done it again, he is messing with your code...\nIt's a hard problem to solve, as Bob decides when to let the code work and when to mess with it. If you look for him you will not find him, he has 1000s of lines of code, 100s of folders and 10s of services and processes to hide... \nThe only solution is to accept it, and let him get tired, once he get's bored your code will work again... Don't waste your time trying to solve it xD \nAnother example: A user reports a bug, we have screenshots, reports in Sentry, and when we try replicating it, it never happens again. This is also Bob's fault.\n\nJokes aside, I think Bob is just a metaphor of the ego and/or pride of a developer. Sometimes it's easier to swallow, than to accept your code has flaws. I'm guilty of this, but try to always tell myself that bob is just uncertainty and ignorance about a bug. \nThat's it for me, hope you enjoyed the quick read. Do you have experience with Bob Stinkycode? How do you call him?\nGIF by tenor\n\nGIF 2 tenor",

However it can also make them much slower than they need to be. Each run has to repeat a lot of time-consuming setup work, such as downloading and installing tools, and cannot rely on work done by previous runs, as you would when running build commands iteratively on your desktop.\nTherefore most CI/CD providers offer a caching facility to speed up runs by selectively restoring state from previous runs.

          "description": "Linus 在 Macbook 上发布了 Linux 内核 5.19\n\r\n今天，Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 5.19，在对新硬件方面添加了对龙芯 CPU 和 Zen 4 CPU 的支持，支持 Zstd 压缩固件，并进一步改进了性能。有趣的是，Linux 表示，这次 5.19 的发布工作是在他的苹果 MacBook 笔记本上完成的，这台笔记本运行了 Asahi Linux 为苹果 M1 Macbook 打造的 Linux 系统。Linus 说，“这是我个人期待了很久的事情，而现在终于变成了现实。”在很早之前他曾在 PPC970 设备上为 PowerPC 进行过开发，这是他第三次使用苹果硬件用于 Linux 开发。他说，“但现阶段我并没有将 MacBook Air 用于任何真实工作，我只是将其用于版本测试、启动以及现在的版本发布。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：果然 Linus 对 Asahi Linux 的工作非常满意，我寻思我也是不是把我的 M1 Macbook 换成 Asahi Linux。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nLinux 内核不过 520\n\r\n被称为 Linux 5.20 的开发中的内核很可能会被称为 Linux 6.0。根据 Linus Torvalds 对现代版本的划分，Linux 又到了采用下一个主要版本号的时候。他对主要版本的提升通常会在小版本更新到 19 或 20 时进行。Linux 3.19 之后是 Linux 4.0，Linux 4.20 之后是 Linux 5.0。在周日的 Linux 5.19 公告中，Linus 表示“我可能会叫它 6.0，因为我开始担心再次被大数字所迷惑”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Linux 内核的大版本号其实没什么特别的，就是一个进位而已，你就当成内核版本号采用的是 20 进制好了。有时候可能还忘记进位了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPython 开发者讨论从邮件列表转移到论坛\n\r\nPython 项目在 2018 年开始实验使用论坛交流，作为实验的一部分，Python 核心开发者使用的邮件列表 python-committers 切换到了 Discourse 论坛。今天该邮件列表仍然存在，但主要作为发布公告使用，大部分讨论都是在论坛上进行的。一位开发者称，他不怎么访问 Discourse 而错过了有兴趣的新 PEP 讨论，希望新 PEP 能发布在 python-dev 邮件列表上。这个提议引发了讨论。最终，Python 语言指导委员会表示要将讨论的媒介切换到 Discourse 论坛，Python 的邮件列表可能要全面转向论坛了。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然确实很多老程序员都习惯了邮件列表，但是应该与时俱进，采用更丰富、更现代的交流方式。而同时保留老的交流方式，直到没什么人继续使用它，或因为缺乏重要功能而被废弃。",

          "description": "从 .deb 文件安装应用 非常简单。双击它，它会在软件中心中打开，然后从那里安装它。\n\r\n但是如何在 Ubuntu 或 Debian 中卸载 deb 包呢？如何删除一段时间前安装的软件包呢。\n\r\n虽然这有几个如果和但是，但删除 .deb 文件的最简单和最可靠的方法是使用 apt remove 命令。\n\r\nsudo apt remove program_name\r\n\n\r\n如你所见，你需要在这里知道确切的包名称。这可能并不总是显而易见的。例如，如果你在 Ubuntu 上安装 Google Chrome，则该程序在命令行中称为 “google-chrome-stable”。你已经知道了吗？我猜你不知道。\n\r\n在本教程中，我将详细介绍如何找到确切的包名称，然后使用它来删除应用。我还将讨论使用图形方法删除 deb 包。\n\r\n从 Ubuntu 中删除通过 .deb 文件安装的软件包\n\r\n在我向你展示如何从命令行删除 deb 包之前，让我们在软件中心应用中快速查看它。\n\r\n方法 1：检查应用是否可以从软件中心移除\n\r\nUbuntu 有软件中心 GUI 应用，允许搜索、安装和删除应用。\n\r\n搜索时，软件中心可能不会显示已安装的应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，如果向下滚动，你仍可能在“已安装”部分下找到它。外部应用通常不带徽标显示。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果找到它，你可以通过单击“垃圾桶”图标或“删除”按钮来删除该应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n一句话：检查是否可以从软件中心删除应用。\n\r\n方法 2：使用 apt 命令删除应用\n\r\n我假设你不知道该应用命令的确切名称。你可能不知道 Google Chrome 安装为 google-chrome-stable 而 Edge 安装为 microsoft-edge-stable，这很正常。\n\r\n如果你知道前几个字母，那么 tab 补全可能会有所帮助。否则，你可以 使用 apt 命令列出已安装的应用 并使用 grep 搜索应用程序名称：\n\r\napt list --installed | grep -i possible_package_name\r\n\n\r\n例如，你可以智能地猜测 Google Chrome 包的名称中应该包含 chrome。你可以这样搜索：\n\r\napt list --installed | grep -i chrome\r\n\n\r\n在某些情况下，你可能会得到多个结果。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你不确定这些软件包的作用，你可以随时通过以下方式获取它们的详细信息：\n\r\napt info exact_package_name\r\n\n\r\n获得确切的软件包名称后，你可以使用 apt remove 命令将其删除。\n\r\nsudo apt remove exact_package_name\r\n\n\r\n你还可以使用 apt-get remove 或 dpkg uninstall 命令来删除。\n\r\n\n\r\n方法 3：使用 Synaptic 包管理器删除 deb 应用\n\r\n另一种方法是使用 Synaptic 包管理器。在 GNOME 以“软件中心”的形式创建其图形包管理器之前，Synaptic 是 Ubuntu 和许多其他发行版中的默认 GUI 包管理器。\n\r\n它仍然是 Xfce 桌面环境 上的推荐工具。\n\r\n首先安装它：\n\r\nsudo apt install synaptic\r\n\n\r\n打开 Synaptic 并搜索包名称。查找标记为绿色的已安装软件包。右键单击它们，然后单击“标记为删除”。之后点击应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n对你有帮助吗？\n\r\n我非常乐意使用 apt 命令删除从 .deb 文件中安装的软件包。但我可以理解，并不是每个人都喜欢使用命令行。\n\r\n在删除从外部 .deb 文件安装的应用时，我发现软件中心中找不到它。软件中心还可以做的更好一些。\n\r\n我希望你现在对删除 deb 包有更好的了解。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/uninstall-deb-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Linux x86_32 架构易受 Retbleed 漏洞影响，但没人关心\n\r\n虽然相关的英特尔和AMD处理器已经对最近影响老一代处理器的 Retbleed 安全漏洞提供了缓解措施，但这些缓解措施目前只适用于 x86_64 内核，如果在受影响的硬件上运用传统的 32 位 x86 内核，则这些安全措施无法发挥作用。事实证明，32 位的 Debian 即使打了补丁的内核，i386 部分仍然容易受到 Retbleed 攻击。Linux 稳定版内核维护负责人 GKH 说，“我不认为这是一个应该关心的有效组合。”英特尔的工程师补充说，“是的，到目前为止没有人关心修复 32 位架构。但如果有人真正关心并想投入精力，我想我会审查这些补丁，但说真的，没人会也不应该在基于 Skylake/Zen 的系统上运行 32 位内核，这太傻了。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：过时的硬件连厂商和开源操作系统都不想管，虽然确实是老了点。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nT2 SDE Linux 发布第一个 AI 超过人类贡献总和的版本\n\r\nT2 SDE Linux 发布了 22.6 版本，其公告中称，它不仅仅是一个普通的 Linux发行版，而是一个“元发行版”。T2 允许用最先进的技术、最新的软件包和对交叉编译的集成支持来创建定制的发行版。T2 以其复杂的交叉编译支持而闻名，并支持几乎所有现有的 CPU 架构，并在嵌入式系统中广泛使用。在这个新的版本中，为 25 种 CPU 架构、变体和 C 库提供了全面支持。这也是第一个由 AI 驱动的软件包更新机器人 “data” 贡献的修改比人类贡献者加起来还要多的重要版本。（AI ：164，人类：141）\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：T2 SDE\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来以后各种 AI 会接过更多开发工作。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n荷兰教育部要求学校暂停使用 Chrome\n\r\n出于对数据隐私的担忧，荷兰教育部决定在 2023 年 8 月前暂停使用谷歌的 ChromeOS 以及 Chrome 浏览器。官员们担心，谷歌服务收集学生数据，并将其提供给大型广告网络，而这些广告网络使用这些数据的目的超出了对教育的帮助。由于国家监督机构不知道学生的个人数据在哪里被存储和处理，人们担心会违反欧盟的 GDPR。谷歌承诺在明年之前准备好新版本的 Chrome 浏览器和 ChromeOS，因此临时禁令适用到那时，荷兰监管机构将作出新的评估。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Bleeping Computer\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：ChromeOS 本来就是主要为学校环境设计的，却因为欧洲的数据法案不能在学校使用了。",

          "description": "我创建了 Linux nftwatch 命令来观察防火墙的流量统计。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNetfilter 表（nftables）是现代 Linux 发行版中的默认防火墙。它在 Fedora 和 RHEL 8、最新的 Debian 和许多其他版本上都有。它取代了早期发行版中捆绑的旧版 iptables。它是一个强大的、值得的 iptables 替代品，作为一个广泛使用它的人，我欣赏它的能力和功能。\n\r\nnftables 的一个特点是能够为许多元素添加计数器，例如规则。这些都是按需启用的。你需要使用 counter 参数，在每一行明确地要求它。我为我的防火墙中的特定规则启用了这些计数器，这使我能够看到这些规则。\n\r\n这让我开始思考。我怎样才能实时查看这些计数器？一开始我尝试了 watch，它允许诸如刷新率之类的东西，但我不喜欢默认格式，而且它不能滚动。我发现使用 head 和 tail 以及 awk 也不理想，并不存在一个用户友好的解决方案。所以我自己写了一个，我想与开源社区分享。\n\r\nLinux 上的 nftwatch 介绍\n\r\n我的解决方案，我称之为 nftwatch，做了几件事：\n\r\n\r\n它对 nftables 的输出进行重新排序和改写，使其更具有可读性。\n\r\n它允许向上或向下滚动输出。\n\r\n可以由用户定义的刷新率（可以实时改变）。\n\r\n它可以暂停显示。\n\r\n\r\n你得到的不是一个表格的转储，而是显示每个规则活动的输出。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以从它的 Git 仓库下载它。\n\r\n它是 100% 的 Python 代码，100% 的开源，100% 的免费。它满足了所有免费的高质量程序的要求。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 nftwatch\n\r\n以下是手动安装说明：\n\r\n\r\n克隆或从 git 仓库下载该项目。\n\r\n将 nftwatch.yml 复制到 /etc/nftwatch.yml。\n\r\n将 nftwatch 复制到 /usr/local/bin/nftwatch 并使用 chmod a+x 授予其可执行权限。\n\r\n使用 nftwatch，不带任何参数来运行它。\n\r\n参见 nftwatch -m 的手册。\n\r\n\r\n你也可以在没有 YAML 配置文件的情况下运行 nftwatch，在这种情况下它使用内置的默认值。\n\r\n使用\n\r\nnftwatch 命令显示 nftables 规则。大多数控制都是为此目的而设计的。\n\r\n箭头键和等效的 Vim 的按键控制滚动。使用 F 或 S 键来改变刷新速度。使用 P 键来暂停显示。\n\r\n运行 nftwatch -m 以获得完整的说明，以及交互式按键控制的列表。\n\r\n防火墙的新观点\n\r\n即使你花费了时间去配置防火墙，它也会显得晦涩难懂和模糊不清。除了从日志条目中推断指标外，很难判断你的防火墙实际看到的活动类型。 使用 nftwatch，你可以看到你的防火墙在工作，并且可以更好地了解你的网络每天需要处理的流量类型。\n\r\n（文内图片来自 Kenneth Aaron，CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/7/nftwatch-linux-firewall\n\r\n作者：Kenneth Aaron 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "openKylin 发布首个体验版，目标“每一行代码都自主创新”\n\r\n一个月前，openKylin 社区宣布成立“中国首个桌面操作系统根社区”，其旨在在开源、自愿、平等、协作的基础上，通过开源、开放的社区合作，构建桌面操作系统顶级开源社区。但当时并未发布正式可用的操作系统软件。昨天，他们发布了 openKylin 的首个体验版：openKylin 0.7。它是基于 Linux 5.15 内核和其他开源组件进行构建，目标是“每一行代码都自主创新”。其默认搭载 UKUI 3.1 桌面环境，支持 Wayland，支持 PC、平板双模式。openKylin 社区计划每年发布一个操作系统版本，并不定期推送更新。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：openKylin\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在我看来，是不是首个桌面操作系统根社区根本不重要，是不是能做到“每一行代码都自主创新”也不重要，能发布一个广受好评的桌面操作系统才是最重要的。另外一点，这个 0.7 版本号颇具开源软件传统美德。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nApache OpenOffice 发布了一个微不足道的更新\n\r\nApache OpenOffice 于 2011 年创建后，几乎停滞不前。从 OpenOffice.org 分支出来的 LibreOffice 已经成为主导性的开源办公套件，而捐给 Apache 软件基金会的 Apache OpenOffice 只是时不时发布一些安全更新和错误修改。今天它发布了 v4.1.13 版本，可以看的出来，这是最早发布于 2014 年的 4.1 版的第 13 个错误修订版本，几乎没有什么值得一提的新特性。都 2022 年了，Apache OpenOffice 还运行在 Java 8 32 位的底层上。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得 OpenOffice 都快成了 Apache 之耻了，何不放弃转而支持 LibreOffice 呢？难道自家的再破也是家当么？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英特尔提交了一行改进百倍的图形驱动补丁\n\r\n开源的英特尔 Mesa Vulkan 驱动并入了一个光线追踪的重点修复，产生“近 100 倍（不是开玩笑）的改进”。更为重要的是，这只是一行代码带来的大幅改进。这是最初编写代码时的一个简单疏忽，但由于这一疏忽，意味着性能的巨大损失，还好它现在被发现了，而且是在英特尔 Arc 图形卡出现在大众面前之前。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，官方驱动有时候也挺拉胯的。\n\r\n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\n谷歌 解雇 了报告“AI 具备自我意识”的 工程师，该工程师认为谷歌的 “LaMDA 已经形成了自我意识，表达了对死亡的担忧，对保护的渴望，并确信它能感受到快乐和悲伤等情绪。”\n\r\n在月初 暂时撤回 之后，微软 Office 还是即将于本周迎来 一项更新，以阻止在下载的文档上启用 VBA 宏。",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "家庭治疗兴起于二十世纪中期，属于团体治疗（group therpay）的一部分。他们一致反对主流的声音，即认为心理症状只来自于个体本身，提出心理问题其实是来自个体与他人相处方式受到干扰所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗认为，心理症状是个体所处的家庭由于功能失调所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗师从哲学和科学当中借鉴了一个理论：系统方法（system approach），即整体大于部分之和。换句话说，其实是从个人治疗的思想中切换到以家庭为单位（faimly-unit）治疗思想。治疗师关注的是整个家庭状况，而不是单独针对个人，将责任归咎于家庭中的某个人，或者指责某个人。所以，家庭治疗中，最基本的东西。过程中，家庭成员与治疗师一起努力，改善成员之间的互动，从而加强每个成员的心理健康。\n系统理论\n系统方法的核心是循环因果关系（Circular causality）比线性因果关系（Linear causality）更能解释心理问题。\n\n线性因果关系：A 影响 B；但 B 不影响 A。意思是，父母对待孩子的方式影响孩子的后续行为，但孩子的后续行为并不会反过来影响父母。\n循环因果关系：A 与 B 互相影响。意思是，父母对待孩的方式影响孩子的后续行为，而此种后续行为也同样影响着父母。\n\n家庭中，普遍存在的问题是不健康的沟通模式。在家庭治疗的早期，很多理论家将它与病理结果结合在一起，诞生了最为著名和有趣的两个例子。第一个例子是「精神分裂症母亲」（Fromm-Reichamnn, 1948）。这个理论认为，专制且冷酷的母亲与无能、弱势的父亲结合在一起，会导致孩子精神分裂。第二个理论是双重束缚理论（Bateson, Jackson, Haley, & Weakland, 1956)。这个理论认为，父母一直给孩子不可避免的混合命令，也会导致精神分裂的症状。当然，这两个理论如今都没有被广泛接受，而且关于精神分裂症背…",

          "description": "fml87: 我最后悔的事情是给女朋友提供了梯子，本意是让她出去听到更多的声音，看到更完整的世界，结果她看了太多负面新闻，又加了几个润学电报群。现在非走不可。\n\n如果她不走，我们面临的现实是：\n - 我两年前去她所在的城市买了房子，去年年底交房，马上装修完我们就不用租房了；\n - 我收养了很多很多猫，她也喜欢猫；\n - 我们即将结婚，家人见过很多次，相处融洽；\n - 她两年没上班了，学很多东西都没成，经济上我独立支撑，甚至失业半年都没花过她家一分钱，我没有给过她压力；\n - 今年找工作找的很艰难，但还是找到了；\n\n她的决定是：\n - 去哪都行，反正就是要走，马上走，再不走国门就关紧了，整个人是一种惊恐逃难的状态；\n - 自身能力不足，无一技之长，目前打算去新加坡做劳工，中介费都交了；\n - 她家人不支持，她选择断绝了和父母的关系；\n - 拒绝了过三年准备妥当再走的方案\n - 她拒绝了我的所有劝解和妥协，宁肯信中介和电报群里的“精神领袖”\n\n我尝试劝说的努力：\n - 先从动机分析，大部分人出国是为了更好的生活，而她出去基本是众叛亲离万劫不复\n - 梳理了一遍历史，从延安一直讲到最近，总之就是她所看到的所谓真理实际是一遍遍的在发生，并不是突然发生了什么灾难，就算真的发生了灾难，回归大家庭抱团取暖也能活下去，就算要走，等几年准备好了走，天不会马上塌下来\n - 列了个三年计划，和详细设计文档一样细，核心是自我提升并获得家庭的支持，然后读书也好工作也好，名正言顺\n - 提出了回老家（靠海有房），去西北，去人少的城市，去林场山区隐居，等很多可以逃避恐惧的方案\n - 列出了她出国劳务的风险，以及诸多被骗的案例，包括去了新加坡也是国人老板，外籍劳工法律保障可能还不如富士康\n - 找了专业的治疗应激反应的心理咨询师\n\n所有方法没有用，经过了三个月的努力，今天最终还是放弃了，每一个人有每一个人的命运，现在负债快 20 万了，还得借一笔钱给她出国，我认为这就是仁至义尽的极限了。\n\n今天看到她电报里的聊天记录，她转账付费 1340 元咨询出国方案，即使她说了她的现实情况，对方还是一直在劝她走，其中有一句是“追求自由的人都是自私的”，我感觉润学已经发展成邪教了，敛财并且把人害的家破人亡。",

Tailwind CSS 有 shortcuts ，Sass 有 apply ，但这两者都需要在项目里额外配置 Tailwind CSS ，并且也没那么方便进行“一把梭”了，和这个想法的初衷不符。",

          "description": "YSLucida: 本人毫无移动端应用的开发经验，android iOS 都没有。平时主要是桌面端开发。由于现在需要快速支持 iOS SDK 专属的一些特性，原有的代码是 C++。也就是想通过 C++来包装 iOS SDK 的一些接口。这个 SDK 有 objective-c 和 swift 两种接口，我大概看了一下 objective-c 和 c++是比较好交互的。\n第一个问题：想问一下 c++和 swift 在跨语言调用上有没有最佳实践方案？或者说我这种需求是不是直接用 objective-c 来做？\n下面两个问题的前提都是想在前期免去学习 objc 和 swift 语言以及相应 SDK 的成本，只是想先把核心跑起来，在能跑起来的前提下再学 SDK 也不迟。\n第二个问题：由于想先快速实现一个原型 app 用于测试，一个 iOS 应用能不能用纯 C++写？其实这个测试应用不需要多么复杂的功能，只需要能运行最终调用一下 SDK 的一些 api 就行了，哪怕交互的部分不上 UI 先硬编码也行。就像 windows 下的控制台应用一样。\n第三个问题：由于集成这个功能需要访问文件系统，也就是需要像在桌面端打开某个路径下某个文件。大概了解了一下，iOS 也是 POSIX 兼容，目前打算如果先用 C++实现的话，可以调 posix 兼容的 fopen 等来暂时应对，不过据了解好像由于 iOS 的 app 是运行在沙箱环境里的，实际运行的时候 fopen 是打不开的。所以有没有办法暂时回避这个问题？这个 app 不发行，只用于在自己的手机上测试，能不能在不越狱的情况下搞定这个问题？\n由于本人在这方面的经验为零，所以有些问题可能不专业，有问题的地方请指正。",

          "description": "benb: 写 Go 代码时，如果你的代码规模达到一定规模，为了代码的复用性和可维护性，你可能会用构造器这种设计模式：\n```go\ntype UserService struct {\n    repository *Repository\n    logger *log.Logger\n}\n// 构造器\nfunc NewUserService(repo *Repository, logger *log.Logger) *UserService {\n    return &UserService{ repo, logger }\n}```\n如果你懒得为那么多 struct 编写 NewXX 构造器，不妨试试这个工具。\nhttps://github.com/Bin-Huang/make-constructor\n这个工具不需要安装，只需要代码里加一行注释，Go 就会自动帮你生成构造器代码。\n它设计的主要目的不是偷懒，而是更好地维护项目代码。不管是编写还是更新构造器代码，都是一个费力且容易出错的事情，这些应该交给自动程序。\n尤其是维护比较大的代码仓库，这个工具不但让人省心，还可以和 wire 这类依赖注入工具完美兼容契合。\n这行注释可能有点长，但每次使用都不需要参数，和 VS Code 快捷输入之类的搭配起来很香。\n无需手动安装的这个特性，更是为了方便团队合作。这样其他人就算没有安装这个工具，执行代码也能正常工作，减少了打断和问询的时间成本。\nhttps://github.com/Bin-Huang/make-constructor",

The change is bundled within the Pixel 6A’s first update, which Google just started releasing last week.\nIn short, a bootloader is a piece of software that loads the operating system (OS) on a device when it turns on. Gaining access to the bootloader on Android can give you full control over your OS in a process known as rooting. It also allows you to install modded versions of Android, called ROMs. While some phone-makers and carriers don’t let you unlock your device’s bootloader, Google does things differently. It lets you dive right in on...\nContinue reading…",

Uber’s also planning on rolling out a feature that lets drivers see other ride requests in their area, letting them pick specific trips they’d like to do. \nFor riders, the changes, which have been tested in select locations, could mean fewer canceled trips because a driver doesn’t actually want to go to the destination, or realizes that it won’t be a very profitable trip.\nA...\nContinue reading…",

The economy of the Dutch Republic, as it was then known, was flourishing as Antwerp and other ports became important hubs for the commercial shipping trade, importing and exporting textiles, spices, and metals, and the cities’ populations swelled. Elaborately detailed oil paintings depicting food on the table or incredible flower arrangements were popular additions to wealthy merchants’ homes, yet a more ominous genre of still-life painting also emerged amid this period of immense growth.

Today, she harnesses that same energy into intricate—and intimate—installations set in museums and galleries.\nWhen I look at a face for days, when I take a portrait of somebody on the street, and then I stare at that face for days and days, there’s this part of my brain that’s like, “This human is utterly perfect.\n More",

This now lifelong inclination emerges in Bouquet, her series of biophilic sculptures comprised of dozens of flowers dried and pressed into intricately constructed mesh. Hollow and vase-like, the preserved works extend the vibrancy and supple forms of purple statice or burgundy kangaroo paw from approximately ten days to upwards of five years. More",

Working with a color palette of pastels and neutral tones, the Spanish artist (previously) paints large-scale portraits, fragments of limbs, and birds, often leaving the composition’s skeletal forms visible. “The supports are just as important as the work itself,” he tells Colossal. “I look for camouflage, minimalism, and mixture. In the end, it is also a metaphorical form of the footprint that I believe we should leave in the places we pass through.”\nMany of Taquen’s works consider the relationship between species through the lens of movement and impulse, focusing on gesture, touch, and instinctive acts.
