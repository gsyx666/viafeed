Chiefly:\nTraditionally APIs are packaged into one deliverable; serverless architecture encourages to divide solutions up into many smaller units that are packaged and deployed individually.\nTraditionally APIs are stateful applications that are started and stopped infrequently; serverless architecture encourages to start up compute tasks only on demand.\nIn this article, I will describe a way to develop a serverless API in TypeScript. The motivation is to develop a solution that makes it…",

          "description": "作为独立开发者 + 业余吉他手，很早前就想开发一款练习歌曲的工具。因为在练习歌曲时，经常需要针对某一个片段播放上百上千次，有时候需要变调（演奏跟原调不一样）、变速等…… \n这些场景在使用 QQ 音乐之类的播放器时，就显得略为不便，找了一圈也没发现特别趁手的工具。得益于技术的进步，特别是音轨分离的技术（有兴趣可以参考 Splitter.ai）的成熟，感觉针对于「如何更高效地学习歌曲」这个课题，我们可以做出一些更 Cool 更好玩有用的东西。\n这就有了我们最近发布的一款音乐工具产品：AudioJam。\n功能介绍\n使用 AI 技术，AudioJam 能从任意的歌曲中，提取出人声、鼓、贝斯、钢琴或键盘、吉他以及其他的音轨，并可以调整音量 Remix。这个技术在扒谱或者跟歌练习的时候特别有用。\n为了表现它惊艳的分离效果，我制作了一个简单的视频：\n \n分离了音轨之后，在电脑端你甚至可以通过重新安排不同乐器的位置，重新混响音乐，模拟更真实的效果。\n\n设置并保存循环之后，就可以不断重复该循环，用于片段的练习。\n\n如果是常用软件，每个细节都是很重要的，因为如果不好用，那每次使用都会给自己添堵。所以在 AudioJam 中，与传统播放器只能通过拖动进度条来定位不同，你还可以拖动波形图，做到精准地控制播放的位置。AudioJam 还支持直接长按波形图由该位置开始慢速预览，这在扒取一些快速音符的时候很有用。\n通过降速功能则可以有效地降低学习难度，也可以通过升降调，找到最适合自己演奏的曲调。\n\n「音乐附件」是我自己很喜欢的一个功能，可以在音乐项目中。创建便签来记录扒谱的结果、需要注意的地方，也可以导入现有的曲谱，当前附件支持预览 Guitar Pro 的曲谱。将歌曲的学习项目化。\n\n我个人觉得对于歌曲学习来说，移动应用并非最好用的工具，在歌曲学习这件事情上，我还是比较喜欢桌面应用，可以更精准地控制跟快速地输入，因此 AudioJam 支持了 iOS、Android、macOS、Windows 4 个平台。\n\n自动扒谱？\n很多朋友，在试用了 AudioJam 之后都给我提出了一个想法，它能不能做到自动扒谱呢？这个课题我个人的看法是这样的：\n我个人不太认可自动扒谱这件事情，因为音乐学习，不应该以变成「人肉读谱机」为目标。而是通过视听扒谱，去理解鉴赏这个音乐作品，而这个过程是就是不断提升自己音乐审美观以及听力的过程，不应该通过技术来偷懒。\n现在互联网的信息发达，大部分的歌曲都能找到别人精心编排好的乐谱，自动扒取的还无法达到这样的水平。不过我也可能会在未来添加上这样的功能。因为扒谱这件事对新手而言太不友好了，如果能自动扒谱的话，作为一个「参考答案」来辅助学习扒谱的话，可以让学习扒谱这件事变得更简单，学习曲线更平缓，也是一个「高效学习」的好功能。\n所以我们也有在调研一些相关的技术，如果有朋友对相关的音视频技术有研究的话，也欢迎跟我们一起探讨。\n\n如果你也有在玩一些乐器，比如吉他、鼓、钢琴或键盘之类的。AudioJam 绝对是一款对音乐学习很有帮助的产品。希望你可以自己下载来体验试试。\n最后，学无止境，与君共勉。希望大家能一直保持，对吉他和对音乐的热爱。\n \n> 下载少数派 客户端 、关注 少数派公众号 ，发现更多实用 App 📱\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "这个题目分为两个方面：\n一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；\n二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。\n1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？\n1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的\n将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。\n最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。\n1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度\n将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。\n如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。\n这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。\n只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。\n下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。\n\n1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果\n至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。\n\n\n\n2.什么样的是好发动机\n热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。\n低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。\n低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。\n高可靠性无需多言。\n两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n广龙先生\n点击下载\n58 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么发动机上最大扭矩不能转化为轮上最大扭矩?\n为什么丰田的2.0发动机有两种功率?",

          "description": "在CES 2022上，索尼公开了第二款概念车VISION-S 0 SUV，而且索尼董事长、总裁兼首席执行官吉田健一郎宣布索尼集团将成立新的部门——索尼移动公司（Sony Mobility Inc），该公司预计在今年春季成立，主要专注于电动汽车商业化。\n\n\nVision-S 02由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队打造，看着看着，这可能成为走向一个新型电动汽车公司的方向么？\n\n\n备注：造车这个事情，戴森走了一轮没走下去。\n\n\n▲图1.Sony的Vision S两款概念车\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\nVision S系列的重点\n\n\n这款概念车是索尼Vision-S由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队来牵头的（机器狗产品Aibo），并且还拉着好几家其他公司来做，包括：NVIDIA、高通、采埃孚、博世（很多部件）、黑莓、QNX、Conti（大量的开发ECU）、本特勒（底盘和电池）、麦格纳（整个EE设计）等等。这个系列最大的特色，还是Vision-S车身内外部署了一套完整的、面向高阶自动驾驶的传感器套件，目的是提供全景影像、360音效、全时连接等特性。\n\n\nSony Vision上的40 个传感器分为：\n16 个 Camera：分为外部8个，分别是环视 4个（IMX390）、侧后摄像头2个（IMX390*2）+、侧视2个（IMX490*2）、内部8个，分别为两个前视立体相机（IMX490*2）、两个ToF 相机（IMX456*2）、驾驶员监控*1、行车记录*1、后摄像头和内部电子个1个、18 个超声波/雷达传感器和 4 个 LiDAR 传感器。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图2.Sony 的Vision S\n\n\n而这台索尼Vision-S的原型车，已经在奥地利参加了公开的路面测试。\n从逻辑上，这是所有参与整个系统构建的一个技术演示，围绕5G技术，可以把诸多感知的电子技术，通过车载系统和云端之间实现高速、高容量和低延迟的连接。也就是说，通过索尼，合作的小伙伴们把VIsion-S打造为一种移动的娱乐空间。\n对于Sony而言，最重要的是需要一个展示的渠道，把Sony在内容、游戏体验和音频上体现出来。通过对VIsion-S的探索，以及合作伙伴的支持，在“移动娱乐空间”这个方向可以有了更多的发展空间。\n\n\n我们仔细研究Sony的业务构成，就能发现索尼已经变成一个围绕游戏机、内容（音乐+电影）的公司。传统上，我们对sony的认知，电子产品只占了1/4不到的业务，而图像传感器CIS是很重要的一块业务。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图3.Sony FY21 Q2的业务构成\n\n\n也就是说，概念车所隶属的Electronics Products & Solutions这个部门，现在已经是一个独立的业务部门。\n从这个意义上来看，Sony和现在苹果的公司结构不一样。苹果可以围绕Apple Car（据说最近苹果抽调了很多资源去做AR和元宇宙了）不停撒钱；Sony肯定和戴森一样烧钱，成立这个业务部门做什么呢？\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图4.索尼的概念车隶属于一个小部门\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\nSony的CIS和激光雷达\n\n\n在Sony科技日展示的内容里面，很重要的一部分就是激光雷达：\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图5.索尼的激光雷达视频\n\n\n有一个重要的背景是，Sony到现在的CIS业务中，在汽车市场里面的占比很低。可以说，索尼的图像传感器CIS部分的新业务开拓，目前还局限在日本车企部分使用，索尼是想通过ADAS领域的需求，能够把自己在移动领域的优势发挥出来。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图6.后疫情时代索尼对于CIS的预测\n\n\n在Vision S系列里面，最多的还是摄像头——这些东西可以作为一个展示给全球汽车企业的方案，并在这个细分市场对安森美进行超越。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图7.Sony的优势CIS领域在汽车里面没做起来\n\n\n\n▲图8.Sony的图像传感器在汽车领域的应用\n\n\n而且一旦有了这个平台，在各项业务和内容中，可以比较容易找到合作伙伴，特别是Sony较少接触的OEM的直接需求——我个人判断这个才是重点，眼下自己去做个汽车公司，完全是得不偿失的事情。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图9.汽车使用的图像传感器，Sony起步较晚\n\n\n\n小结：我个人判断，除了中国和美国，传统欧洲和日本很难出现创业汽车公司，而这两个地方也没有所谓的软件巨头，戴森和Sony这样做产品的公司进入汽车行业也很难赢。\n我想下一步就ADAS摄像头和汽车CIS这个市场进行打开分析，可能效果好一些。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n朱玉龙\n点击下载",

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n进入12月后，勇士队遭遇了一波进攻寒潮。11月，他们还能打出114.8分的百回合得分，而到了12月就只剩下了110.5分，在1月的三场比赛中更是低到了107.4分。相应地，球队核心库里也“难辞其咎”，个人百回合得分从11月的116.4分跌落到了12月的112.1、1月的110.2分，真实命中率更是从63.9%跌到了58.1%，1月份更是惨不忍睹的39.4%。\n对于造成勇士和库里如此下滑的原因，首先当然是库里个人的消耗问题。本赛季，库里在每回合之中、特别是进攻端的移动距离，比之17-18、18-19赛季，都有了一定的上涨。在曾经的勇士2.0时代，库里已经是一个拥有大量无球跑动、不断进行换位移动的进攻手，而本赛季的他则在本已不小的跑动量上进一步提高，来到了后卫中进攻跑动第九多的位置，且年过三十的年龄，也在加兰、科尔安东尼、德章泰穆雷等一众年轻人之中，显得格外突出。而在防守端，由于勇士一贯采取的集体换防策略，库里的跑动量自然也不会少，18-19赛季就有着后卫中第八多的防守移动，而本赛季也只是相对下降了0.07米。况且，我们还需要考虑到库里为了增强防守对位能力而采取的增重，对身体造成更大的负担。\n\n年龄的增加、体重的上升、移动的剧化，随着赛季的深入，这些问题逐渐开始影响库里，拉低了他的表现稳定性。这是每一个核心球星都必然面对的生涯阶段，出现波动，并不算非常离奇。而在此前的赛程中，勇士队也及时地找到了能为库里排忧解难、分担压力的替代者，乔丹普尔成为了球队的二号持球手，策动了相当比例的挡拆回合，也成为了比威少之于詹姆斯来得性价比远高的解压存在。\n然而，这样的良好趋势，却在12月开始，特别是到了1月份的几场比赛，开始出现了裂痕。对此，我们可以从阵容搭配中的变量来做初步把握。球队进攻最为气势如虹的11月，乔丹普尔场均拥有31.5分钟的出场时间，14.7次出手，…",

          "description": "常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。\n \n其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。\n\n\nPart 1|咨询前\n 确认专业资质和能力 \n\n1. 教育经历\n 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。\n比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。\n而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。\n\n\n\n国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：\n\n精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；\n临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；\n学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；\n私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。\n\n在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。\n2.执业资格\n除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。\n2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。\n\n\n\n但即便有证书，也…",

          "description": "机器学习方案将帮助不同的无线电协议，如 Wi-Fi 和 LTE，在同一的无线频谱中更有效地协同工作。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）开发的机器学习方案有可能显著改善 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率的方式。研究人员声称，与试错法相比，NIST 的方案可以使共享通信频率的过程的效率提高多达 5000 倍。\n\r\nNIST 系统的理念是，无线电设备可以从经验中学习其网络环境，而不是像现在这样，简单地根据试错法选择频率信道。\n\r\nNIST 在 其网站上的一篇文章 中说，在特定的环境条件下，“该算法可以学习哪个信道提供最好的结果”。\n\r\n该团队说:“该方案可以被编程到现实世界中许多 [不同] 类型网络的发射机软件中。”\n\r\n从本质上讲，这个计算机模拟的算法是一个映射环境射频条件的先前经验的公式。例如，这些条件可以包括在一个信道（一组相邻的频率）内运行的发射机的数量。\n\r\n文章说：“……如果发射机选择了一个未被占用的信道，那么成功传输的概率就会上升，从而导致更高的数据速率。”同样地，当发射机选择一个没有太多干扰的信道时，信号会更强，你也会得到更好的数据速率。发射机会记住哪个信道提供了最佳结果，并学会在下次需要清晰信号时学会选择那个位置。\n\r\n这与今天的工作方式不同。也就是说，无线电只是试图找到一个开放频率，然后与类似协议的无线电进行通信。在复杂的情况下，使用诸如 Wi-Fi、跳频和 波束成形 等技术来优化信道。\n\r\n研究人员解释说，NIST 的机器学习技术的亮点在于共享频谱，比如通过授权频谱辅助接入（LAA）共享 Wi-Fi。LAA 是非授权频谱中的 LTE 频谱，称为 LTE-U，频率为 5GHz。在相同频率下的 Wi-Fi 与 LAA 的组合中，协议是不同的：无线电之间不能相互通信以协调工作，而且频带越繁忙就可能出现混乱 —— 传输会遇到其他传输。但是，如果所有的无线电接收机都能更好地选择它们的占位，通过学习哪些有效，哪些无效，那么这将会更好。\n\r\nNIST 工程师 Jason Coder 在文章中说：“这可能会使非授权频段的通信更加高效。”\n\r\n事实上，NIST 声称，它“可以帮助 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率，其效率大约是试错法的 5000 倍。”\n\r\n这里的关键词是“共享”，因为为了在有限的频谱内增加通信，必须进行更多的共享 —— 物联网或媒体流等用户都在争夺同样的隐喻资产。随着物联网和数字技术的不断发展，非授权和授权频段的结合，就像 LAA 中的情况一样，可能会变得更加普遍。（非授权的频段是指那些没有分配给特定用户的频段，比如移动网络运营商；授权频段是在拍卖中中标并分配的。）\n\r\n在 NIST 场景中，相互竞争的发射机“各自学习在不相互通信的情况下最大化网络数据速率”。因此，多种协议和数据类型，如视频或传感器数据，或 Wi-Fi 和移动网络，可以相互协作。\n\r\nNIST 的方案大大简化了为发射机分配最佳信道的过程，根据这篇文章研究发现，穷尽努力 [使用试错法] 来确定最佳解决方案需要大约 45600 次试验，而这个方案只需要尝试 10 个渠道就可以选择类似的解决方案，仅仅付出 0.02% 的努力。”\n\r\nNIST 的研究人员在 IEEE 第 91 届车辆技术会议上展示了他们的研究成果。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3561618/nist-aims-to-make-frequency-sharing-more-efficient-for-wireless-networks.html\n\r\n作者：Patrick Nelson 选题：lujun9972 译者：CN-QUAN 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "开源开发者自毁其广泛使用的依赖库\n\r\n开源库 colors.js 和 faker.js 被广泛使用。在 NPM 上，colors.js 的周下载量超过 2000 万次，有近 19000 个项目依赖它。前几天，它的开发者在这些库的最新版本中加入了无限循环和乱码，依赖它的项目会在控制台看到不停打印的非 ASCII 字符。他将这两个库的 自毁版本 推送到了 GitHub 和 NPM，因而导致多个使用这些依赖库的软件出现故障，其中包括亚马逊的 AWS CDK。这位开发者似乎是因为没有得到使用他的开源软件的大公司的 付费，而专门做了这种破坏。这件事引来了业界和社区的激烈讨论。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我认为，你可以因没有得到报酬而放弃项目，但是这不是你蓄意报复的理由。如果一开始就想着获益，请发布你的商业版本。这种最初遵循开源许可证和开源文化的开源软件，在邀名不成、获利不得后恼羞成怒地大肆破坏，或许没有违反许可证和法律，但是却给整个开源文化泼了一盆脏水。我对这种行为持反对意见。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMozilla 基金会其实从 2014 年就开始接受加密货币捐款\n\r\n之前我们报道过，Mozilla 基金会官方 Twitter 账号在 1 月 1 日提醒粉丝它接受加密货币，如比特币、以太坊的捐款，但这一声明招致了 猛烈批评，最终迫使 Mozilla 基金会宣布 暂停 接受加密货币捐款。但实际上 Mozilla 基金会从 2014 年就开始 接受加密货币捐款，当时 Mozilla 还列举了其它接受加密货币捐款的组织，如可汗学院、电子前沿基金会、绿色和平组织和维基媒体基金会。到今天，只有绿色和平组织停止接受加密货币捐款。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：加密货币是否该死，我觉得不能用政治正确来评判。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWindows 11 上仍能使用软驱和软盘\n\r\n去年发布的 Windows 11 系统，调整了硬件安装需求，很多硬件都不再支持，需要使用较新的 CPU 和 TPM 2.0 等等。但是，有用户发现，Windows 11 上居然还可以成功使用索尼 5.25 寸软盘。这意味着，Windows 11 对外部设备还保留了不错的兼容性。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 5.25 寸、3.5 寸软盘已经基本退出历史舞台，可在特定领域依然有用武之地，但这个反差让我有些吃惊。",

          "description": "写在前面\n老实说这篇年终总结一开始写得并不顺利，一直没有什么好的思路。\n简单回忆了一下 2021 年经历的几件大事：跳槽、离职旅行、搬家、爷爷去世。现在心境相比 2021 年初已经有了很大的改变，可能这就是所谓的「成长」吧。\n这次打算用「重新认识自己」——「继续热爱生活」——「做自己」——「变优秀」——「学会和自己和解」来组成这篇年终总结。\n重新认识自己\n工作\n在 2021 年的 6 月我结束了毕业后的第一份工作，选择从国企离职，进入了一家互联网公司。国企与互联网带给我的工作体验是完全不一样的，详情写在了这里：从国企到互联网，一个初入职场将近一年半工作经验程序员的「得」与「失」。\n但在新公司待了快半年，意识到其实自己也不喜欢现在的这份工作。因为带自己的 mentor 被裁，导致自己平时工作遇到难点几乎找不到同事寻求帮助，一而再地受到打击，得不到工作上的成就感，渐渐地自己开始厌倦现在这份工作以及这个职业。其实自己也知道，又有多少人真正喜欢工作呢，打工还不是为了混口饭吃。但是我觉得自己还年轻，还想多尝试尝试。\n想起来之前和一位朋友讨论过职业规划的问题，我觉得大部分人没有一定阅历是规划不出什么的，因为不知道自己真正喜欢的是什么，但是不规划怎么又能有丰富的阅历做支撑呢。我觉得这是一个悖论，唯一的解决方法是有一个你信得过且对你很了解的前辈告诉你应该选什么方向做什么类型的工作，但是这样就不是自己的人生了。\n比如我之前在国企，做的是 ToG 相关的工作，经历过后发现一点也不喜欢条条框框的限制。现在在一家互联网公司做内部系统开发，氛围很自由，只是当前的工作内容并不太喜欢。\n但依然没有想好自己真正想做什么，可能还是不敢勇敢迈出那一步吧。还需要多找些行业前辈进行交流与请教，过来人的经验真的很有用。最近和一位做产品的朋友交流，意识到各行各业都没有外人看上去那么光鲜亮丽，不要抱有太高的期望，结果往…",

          "description": "在使用飞书以前，我是如何网络授课的\n2020年一月，一场疫情将人类社会冻结。工作冻结、生活冻结。人们被关在家里没法出门，也不能参与到工作当中。也正是因为这样，催生出了「远程办公」这样的模式，让一直不被大家重视的「协同办公」走到了历史的舞台最前方，展现出了不一样的魅力。\n传统的协同办公，自然要提到 Google Workspace 这个远程协同办公的老大哥。在日本的公司里，经常需要讨论教案或者上课的一些新方法，有些时候需要整理成文档。公司有订阅 Workspace ，所以我们都在其上面讨论或者通过文档来交流对于教案的看法。\n同样因为疫情受到影响的，还有我们上课的流程。以往都是线下面授课，疫情期间全部改为用 Zoom 给学生上网课，这个时候就涉及到了板书问题。线下可以写在白板上，线上怎么办呢？在使用飞书以前，我的解决办法是用 iPad 加入会议，然后再用 iPad 来共享屏幕进行板书。这样确实很方便，却也存在一个不可调和的问题——画面同步差到极致。往往一个流畅的书写过程被卡顿的屏幕共享硬生生切成了三个分解动作；往后流畅地翻页被其分解成了 PPT 没有过度特效的翻页。\n总之，一切的一切，都迫使我停止使用 iPad 来作为板书工具，并且急需一个替代品。这个代替品既能起到「板书」的作用，同时还能兼顾 PDF 阅读器的职能。最好还能在 PDF 文件上做标记。\n开始尝试使用飞书\n需求有了，接下来就是对比市面上的产品了。学生年龄在初中阶段，用 Coda 或者 Worspace 不太合适，他们可能并没有太多精力去研究这两个东西到底怎么用；用 Notion 的话导入 PDF 又非常不便； iPad 更是不再考虑，它最多只能作为一个辅助性的工具。\n找到飞书是个巧合，完全是在研究工作流的时候碰到了飞书，并且被这个远程办公的模式启发，觉得可以用在我的课堂上。说干就干，于是我从本地将我目前保留的教案全…",

          "description": "CloudStorage: \n前言\n随着业务规模的不断扩大，企业越来越重视构建高性能、高可用的大型分布式系统。为了解决应用耦合，合理进行流量削锋，腾讯云提供了包括 CKafka 和 TDMQ 在内的一系列消息队列中间件。为了更方便地对消息队列中的数据进行转存和持久化，腾讯云对象存储 COS 为用户提供了云消息队列备份的能力。\n一、云消息队列备份方案-使用 COS 应用集成备份\nCOS 应用集成 是腾讯云对象存储 COS 基于 Serverless 云函数，为开发者提供的存储数据应用解决方案。开发者只需要在 COS 控制台一键配置，即可使用丰富的功能。\nCOS 应用集成提供了云消息队列备份的能力，开发者可以轻松配置定时备份任务，将云消息队列中的消息记录以文件的形式转至对象存储，以便进行持久化保存。开发者可以通过备份文件提取消息记录，对消息进行入库、统计分析等操作。\n\n二、方案优势\n存储成本低：对象存储支持数据归档和降冷，长期存储成本低；\n可视化操作：一键配置，简化开发流程，无需编码工作；\n指定范围：可指定消费的起始位置，排除不需要的记录；\n消息聚合：可按分钟维度聚合消息记录，并支持修改时间粒度；\n自动化执行：云函数自动完成云消息队列 CKafka / TDMQ 的数据备份，中间过程无需任何人工操作；\n三、云消息队列介绍\n**消息队列 **CKafka （ Cloud Kafka ）是一个分布式、高吞吐量、高可扩展性的消息系统，100%兼容开源 Kafka API 0.9.0 至 2.8.0 版本。CKafka 基于发布订阅模式，通过消息解耦，使生产者和消费者异步交互，无需彼此等待。CKafka 具有数据压缩、支持离线和实时数据处理等优点，适用于日志压缩收集、监控数据聚合等场景。\n**消息队列 TDMQ **（ Tencent Distributed Message Queue ）是腾讯基于 Apache Pulsar 自研的一个云原生消息中间件系列，其中包含兼容 Pulsar 、RabbitMQ 、RocketMQ 等协议的消息队列子产品，得益于其底层计算与存储分离的架构，TDMQ 具备良好的弹性伸缩以及故障恢复能力。\n四、备份任务设置步骤\n这里以设置 CKafka 消息备份任务为例，TDMQ 设置与之相似：\n登录腾讯云 对象存储 COS 控制台。\n在左侧导航中，单击 [应用集成] ，找到 [ CKafka 消息备份] 。\n单击 [配置备份规则] ，进入规则配置页面。\n单击 [添加函数] 。注意：如果您尚未开通云函数服务，请前往 云函数控制台 开通云函数服务，按照提示完成服务授权即可。\n在弹出的窗口中，配置如下信息：\n\na.函数名称：作为函数的唯一标识名称，创建后不可修改（您可以在云函数控制台上查看该函数）。\nb.关联存储桶：存放 CKafka 消息的 COS 存储桶。\nc.时间粒度：根据消息量的大小，选取汇聚消息的时间间隔，时间间隔为 5 - 15 分钟不等。为保证转存性能，聚合文件数量与 Partition 数量、partition_max 设置数值有关。有关 Partition 的说明，请参见分区。\nd.SCF 授权：CKafka 消息备份需要授权云函数从您的 CKafka 服务中读取相关实例消息，并将消息转存至您指定的存储桶中。因此需要添加此授权。\n6.单击 [下一步] ，进行 CKafka 配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.实例选择：选择消息来源的 CKafka 实例，仅支持同地域的 CKafka 实例。\nb.主题选择：选择消息来源的主题。\nc.起始位置：消息转储备份时历史消息的处理方式，topic offset 设置。\nd.访问地址：必须为 VPC 内网访问地址，基础网络的 CKafka 实例请添加路由策略，具体请参考 添加路由策略。注意：对应的 VPC 子网中必须有可用的 IP ，且必须支持 DHCP 。\n7.单击 [下一步] ，进行投递配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.投递的路径：备份文件的投递路径前缀，不填写则默认保存在存储桶根路径，指定前缀必须以斜杠 “ / ” 为结尾。\n8.添加配置后，单击 [确认] ，即可看到函数已添加完成。\n\n五、查看备份文件\n等待一段时间后，可以看到存储桶下投递了备份文件，其内容的每行代表一条消息记录。\n\n\n\n好了，本期关于云备份方案将分享到这里，欢迎点击“链接”，查看更多云消息队列备份攻略。",

          "description": "theme: juejin\n本文描述的虚拟机内存管理优化方案，是从应用侧视角对 Android 虚拟机内存管理进行改造，优化了虚拟机对 LargeObjectSpace 的内存管理策略，间接增加其它内存空间使用上限。改造后的方案，32 位运行环境 LargeObjectSpace 的内存使用上限可达到 2G 甚至更多（64 位环境使用上限理论上会趋于无限大）。通过本方案可以最大程度上从系统侧解决诸多应用都会遇到的内存瓶颈和 OOM 问题，一键接入，安全可靠。\n1.背景\nJava OOM对于 Android 开发者来说并不陌生，随着应用愈发复杂，部分业务在设计之初为了更好的产品体验，往往会考虑用空间换时间，长此以往，有限的内存资源将会不堪重负，尤其是在一些重大活动期间，内存挑战会更加严峻，稍有不慎就会暴雷。\n为了应对这种情况，开发同学往往会从应用层面进行优化，减少缓存，但随着产品持续迭代，内存问题始终如达摩克利斯之剑，让应用处于崩溃的边缘。好在 Android 系统维护人员也意识到了这种问题，从 Android O 系统开始，对 Java 内存管理策略进行了调整，重点包括实例化 Bitmap 对象时，Bitmap 源数据的内存不再通过虚拟机申请，而是直接在 Native 层申请和管理，因此这部分内存不会纳入虚拟机 Heap 内存统计，以此来减少 LargeSpace 的占用，进而间接增加了其他内存空间的实际使用范围（此消彼长的关系），如下示意图：\n\n通过调整 Bitmap 的内存管理策略以减少虚拟机整体内存使用，的确带来了立竿见影的效果。以字节公司内部诸多 App 为例，Android O 之后的移动设备，Java OOM 远远低于早期的系统版本。\n2.思考与破局\n对于上述 Android 内存管理策略优化，可以看到其实只有 Android N 以上版本受益，但是市面上仍有大…",

          "description": "theme: github\n背景是这样的，\n我们对外提供了一个 sdk，收到客户的反馈，说他们监控平台监测到 sdk 内部的一个接口 A 经常有耗时，最多能达到 10 几秒。\n可从我们自己的平台看，接口 A 的耗时是正常范围的，而且使用的网络库 timeout = 8s，不太可能出现耗时 10 几秒的问题。\n由于客户也没有稳定的复现场景，也不排除是对方统计工具的问题，就卡住了。\n进展，\n重新回到代码中，经过又一番的代码走查，注意到了该接口有使用 AsyncTask ，点进 AsyncTask 源码一看，突然有种玄学变科学的感觉：\n    private static final int CORE_POOL_SIZE = 1;\n    private static final int MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE = 20;\n    private static final int KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS = 3;\n    public static final Executor THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR;\n    ...\n\n    static {\n        ThreadPoolExecutor threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(\n                CORE_POOL_SIZE, MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE, KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS,\n                new SynchronousQueue(), sThreadFactory);\n        threadPoolExecutor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(sRunOnSerialPolicy);\n        THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR = threadPoolExecutor;\n    }\n\n了解线程池的应该都知道，\nCORE_POOL_SIZE : 核心线程数。核心线程只有在 allowCoreThreadTimeOut = true 时，才会被回收，否则不会被回收掉的，即使没有任务执行，也会保持空闲状态。\nMAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE : 线程池最大允许创建的线程数。当线程数量达到 corePoolSize， 且 workQueue 队列塞满后，才会继续创建线程；当创建的线程达到 MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE 时，新来的任务会执行拒绝策略。\nKEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS : 表示非核心线程在没有任务执行时，最多能保持多少时间会被回收。\nSynchronousQueue\n直接在网上找了一段容易理解的定义：\n“ SynchronousQueue 是一个不存储元素的阻塞队列，消费者线程调用 take() 方法的时候就会发生阻塞，直到有一个生产者线程生产了一个元素，消费者线程就可以拿到这个元素并返回；生产者线程调用put()方法的时候就会发生阻塞，直到有一个消费者线程消费了一个元素，生产者才会返回。”\n结论\n由于 CORE_POOL_SIZE = 1, 且阻塞队列为 SynchronousQueue，所以 AsyncTask 执行的任务为串行执行。而其 THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR 线程池又是静态的，所以不同 AsyncTask 对象会共用该线程池。所以我们应当避免使用 AsyncTask，尤其是在 sdk 开发中。\n经过全局查找，发现项目内还有一个鉴权接口 B 也使用了 AsyncTask，所以该事故原因为，在网络环境较差时，接口 B 请求服务，会阻塞接口 A 请求, 导致客户统计耗时增加，最大耗时 2 * timeout。\n方案\n规范代码，使用统一的线程池。ThreadPoolSchedulers 就不细贴了，就是创建了一个 Executor\n    asyncTask.executeOnExecutor(ThreadPoolSchedulers.io());\n\n文章完。",
