These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.\nWhen these distinctions aren't made, you can run into trouble.

          "description": "Written by Sarah Chima Atuonwu ✏️\nPostgreSQL v14 was recently released with some major improvements. Some of these improvements include enhancements for heavy workload performance, improved support for distributed workload, and security enhancements.\nOne of the most exciting releases is enhanced support for JSON, which will be the focus of this blog post.\nBefore we delve into these improvements, let’s get a good understanding of how JSON has been used in PostgreSQL. This will help us to appreciate the improvements better.\nJSON was first introduced in Postgres with its v9.2 release. While it was a very exciting development, its implementation was not perfect. Postgres basically validated that the JSON to be stored is valid JSON and stored it as a text string.\nA major improvement came with t…",

          "description": "During my time as a developer I've created a lot of \"typed\" code. One particular issue has come up repeatedly and I finally had a moment of clarity.\nWhenever I write something like this ...\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport interface DataModel {\n  config: ConfigType; // ERROR HERE\n  [key: string]: string;\n}\n\n... I get the following error on the commented line above.\nProperty 'config' of type 'ConfigType' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'string'.\nThe issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.\nI've seen something like the following ...\nexport interface Person {\n  id: number;\n  firstname: string;\n  lastname: string;\n  [key: string]: string | number;\n}\n\n... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.\nI came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.\nThis approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport type DataModel = {\n  config: ConfigType;\n} & {\n  [key: string]: string;\n};\n\nThe following code is another resolution.\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport interface DataModel {\n  config: ConfigType;\n  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;\n}\n\nThis approach has the \"issue\" that a new \"key\" could be used with another ConfigType.\nAs I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.\nIf anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.",

If he solves he will receive gift on his email.\nPrinted a bar code on a paper and put it on my friend's workstation desk. Upon scanning, it redirects to a simple website I've created using wixsite.com.\nHere's the picture of printed barcode along with other gifts -\n\n\nThe landing page shows following instruction -\n \nTo get your gift all you need is an email address.\nBefore I tell you more, why don't you give a try yourself to find the email address? Here's the link after scanning barcode - https://turantsephele.wixsite.com/giftgenerator\nS\nC\nT\nO\nS\nE\nN\nE\nS\nT\nOnce you click \"Get email address\", it redirects you to another page which shows a timer and nothing else. And with a small hidden button somewhere in page.\nIf you are able to find the button and click, it redirects you to brainfuck visualizer with some pre-populated code. \nI've written this code in brainfuck and when you run it outputs next hint.\nThat brainfuck code outputs a simple string -\nDecode:747572616e7473657068656c6540676d61696c2e636f6d\n\nAfter decoding, it gives you the email address.\nI have created a IFTTT flow which triggers when there is an incoming email with subject \"HOG RIEEDERRRRR\" and it is from my friend's email address.\nOnce this condition matches, IFTTT sends an email back with gift coupon details.\nOnce timer ran out it reveals a link to brainfuck visualizer code.\nIf he can't solve the puzzle in 3 days, an email triggers and sent gift coupon details to friend's email address.

Yet, it is still possible to land an engineering role, even without experience. \nThe following tips are mainly dedicated to computer science or software engineering graduates looking to land their first engineering role. However, self-taught developers and boot-camp graduates can still benefit from this article.\nI'm going to list five actionable steps that I hope can help you land your first …",

          "description": "If you want to know from what exact commit your app is built you can include the latest git commit hash to the place where you display the app version. I like to call that generated hash “revision” or in short “rev”.\nDisplaying this can be useful when you are distributing internal versions of your apps to QA engineers and you want to know on what app version they are testing. While the changes are coming in on development branches we don’t increase version or build numbers, we follow the revision value and always know what version is in use.\nIn this article I will explain how to fetch the latest git commit hash in Xcode and display it in the iOS app.\nThe procedure I will describe adds a new row to your Info.plist file with specified key and sets the value to the short git commit hash.\nThe first step is to go to your target’s Build phases setting and add a new run script phase. The “Run script” action will be on the bottom and you need to move it above the “Copy bundle resources” action.\nWhen you move it, you can paste this code for the script:\nGIT=`xcrun -find git`\nGIT_REV=`${GIT} rev-parse --short HEAD`\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :REVISION ${GIT_REV}\" \"${SRCROOT}/{{path-to-your-info.plist-file}}\"\n\nIn the script above we rely on PlistBuddy to set the key REVISION and the value of the latest git commit hash to the app’s Info.plist file. PlistBuddy is a macOS utility that helps us to manage plist files. You can read more about it here or you can type /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h in your terminal to find out more of what it can do.\nNow, when you have run the build process, the script that we added should’ve inserted a new entry in your Info.plist file and we can proceed to displaying it.\nTo display the revision we just need to fetch our Info.plist and provide a key to read the value from it:\nlet revision = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: \"REVISION\") as? String \n\nIn Objective-C we would do it like this:\nNSString *revision = [NSBundle.mainBundle objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@\"REVISION\"];",

In this post, I'm going to discuss the manual way of removing a specific version of the .NET SDK and runtime from MacOS.\nIn your terminal in Mac OS, type the command, dotnet --list-sdks, and you will see the whole list of .NET SDKs you've installed so far, including the full path.\n\nThis time, run the command, dotnet --list-runtimes, to get the whole list of the installed .NET runtimes.\n\nDid you find some differences between SDKs and runtimes, other than the paths?

This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.\nVanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.\nJS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.\nJavaScript can be used for the following:\n Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.\n Creating web and mobile applications.\n Building web servers and developing server applications.\n Game Development\nTypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.\n TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.\n TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.\n JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.\n TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn't need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.\n\nThe benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:\n Supports Class and Modules.\n Static Type-checking\n ES6 Feature Support\n Clear Library API definition.\n Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.\n Superset of JavaScript\n\nAs TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.",

          "description": "For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.\nAvailable in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:\nconst { randomUUID } = require(\"crypto\");\nrandomUUID(); // \"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\nIt's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!\nYou can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.",

When ML algorithms offer information before it is known, the benefits for business are significant. Integrating machine learning algorithms for inference into production systems is a technological barrier hence the need for deploying ML models as API'S. \nIn this short article, we implement AI based models to detect COVID-19 in Chest X-rays and CT Scans using four Deep Learning Algorithms: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception.

          "description": "Article by Jay Allen\nLearning AWS is complicated enough. But learning AWS is made more challenging when you're also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. \nIn simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. \nStacks can be stood up manually. However, it's better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…",

These are quickly becoming standard features for many web apps, and tools like Slate make them easier to implement, ensuring your program won’t get bogged down in complexity.\nAlthough Slate is still in beta at the time of writing, it’s natural to ask whether it has the potential to replace more mature platforms like Quill and Draft.js.

I have too, and that's why on more than one occasion I've wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.\nOkay! to start with this:\nHTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it \"programming language\" should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a \"markup language\" because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.\nAs I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :\n<tag>content</tag>\n\nHowever this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :\n<img>\n\nBut that's not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like \"upgrades\" of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.\n<tag attribute=\"value\">content</tag>.\n\nIt seems interesting, doesn't it?

Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool\nMy tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas. \nGIF of responsive layout\n\nScreen-shot of the Layout\n\nThe next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.\nScreen shot of app in development, no styling\n\nNow for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. \nThe one thing I didn't know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time. \nScreenshot of CSS code for setting multiple background images\n\n\nYou can play with the solution here\nI learned how to add multiple background images at one time. \nI was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: \nDesign a responsive layout\nBuild a foundation with HTML\nAdd content\nStyle with CSS, section by section\nEnd with functionality (JavaScript & CSS animation/transitions)\nThis \"Ground up\" methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra \"Slow is Fast\".   \nTips on Background Images  by CSS Tricks\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "Mensah Alkebu-Lan\nPrerequisites\nDiscussion\nReferences\nSome familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.\nArrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.\nThe Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.\nBelow is a typical example of how the filter function is used:\nvar arr1 = [1,2,3,4],\n    arr2 = [2,4],\n    res = arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item));\n\nconsole.log(res);\n\nWhen this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array. \n Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter.

If you are coding on Visual Studio Code like me, you should activate git blame by following these steps :\n- Open Visual Studio Code\n- Press Ctrl+Shift+X (windows) or ⇧⌘X (Mac)\n- Type blame\n- Click install on Git Blame\nNow, you can see at the bottom of the vs code window who is responsible for the line of code you have your cursor on, as you can see on the image below: line 37 Sara Ounissi (that would be me), pushed this code 1 day ago.\n\nHowever, the aim of this option is not just to see who wrote the code, but why and when. You can click on the name of the person, this will open a pop-in, the button View will then redirect you to the git repository where you will see the whole modification, the name of the commit, etc… Hopefully, that will help you get more context.",

After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.\nA quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties' blogs about anything open-source. \nFor my task, I had to customize Telescope's build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:\nAdd header and side navigation bar\nChange side navigation default logo into Telescope logo\nUpdate link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Working on the issue\n\n\nAfter setting up the development environment using Telescope's documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.\nI began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn't break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. \nSince I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn't break or miss anything.\nSimilar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.\nCheers! 🍻",

I then had to prepare for a couple meetings I had today. Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.\nAt the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.\nI will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.\nI also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week's worth of changes. \nA little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I'm not too upset about it. \nA clean slate, a new approach!\nI am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it's really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. \nComplicated state management between components. I still haven't quite nailed it down.\nThat's all for today! Thanks for following, if you have any suggestions, please leave them in the comments below!",

However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.\nTo avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.\nIn this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:\nresource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {\n    bucket = “old-name”\n}\n\nand you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.\nFirstly, we’ll need to create a new bucket.

I've been mostly sticking to this for a couple months anyway, but I want to officially commit to it as a way to force myself to keep on track and log my progress.\nSpeaking of logging my progress, I think I'll make posts here every 10 days detailing what I've been up to and what I've learned. I'm in the midst of the Ruby Path at The Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I've been working on building a game of Mastermind, which is easily the most complicated thing I've had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I'll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 \nSince this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I'm visiting my family back home. But other than that, I plan to keep on schedule barring some intense illness or emergency. Looking forward to expanding my skills and getting on a new career path 💯",

While the linting itself was not a problem, I ran into some serious dependency tree errors and really got lost in the forest of it. Solving these errors was a really long winded process and it ate up a lot of the time I had set aside for working. In the future, I will need to be much more careful when setting dependencies; I didn't realize how convoluted it could get to fix.\nAs is usual, Tuesday is my busiest day of the week and this Tuesday will be no exception. My plans are to continue with FreeCodeCamp's tutorials and any spare time I get to work on my project will be a blessing.\nDealing with dependencies in React. I need to learn more about the config files, especially package.json and the different ways I can go about solving dependency errors.

          "description": "一年一度的黑色星期五促销已经开始了，各大海外电商纷纷推出了自己的优惠措施，不知道刚刚经历双十一的血雨腥风的你还有多少力气来参战这场购物节。少数派的作者们推荐了一些正在促销的购物平台，为你的海淘提供一些参考。\n亚马逊海外购\n🔗 网站链接 >\n@鹿额：虽然亚马逊中国内地的电商业务在 2019 年已经停止运营，但其中专营跨境电商的海外购业务依然保留了下来。目前，亚马逊海外购的商品品类囊括了服装、计算机、美妆、玩具等等 12 大类，主要由海外的亚马逊美国/英国/日本/德国负责销售并直邮中国内地，并且在「黑色星期五」期间会有不小的折扣。\n\n相比于自己亲自海淘或是进行转运，亚马逊海外购的一大优点便是相对更加省心，因为购物过程中无需顾虑支付和转运上的一些问题。一些经常海淘的朋友可能曾遇到过这样的情况：在某些美国的品牌官网或是电商网站进行购物时，商家出于一些因素的考虑会对由中国大陆发行的信用卡支付的订单、信用卡账单地址与运输地址不一致的订单或是商品运输地址明显为转运仓库地址的订单进行「砍单」处理，从来带来一些不必要的麻烦以及时间成本。\n\n使用亚马逊海外购则无需担心上述问题，亚马逊网站会在商品详情页清楚地标注商品由哪个国家的亚马逊发货，同时在显著的位置标识商品价格、预估进口税费、预计送达日期区间、是否支持无理由退货等信息，下单付款后等待收货即可，除了商品国际运输所花费的时间稍长（通常约为 7-14 天）、售后服务凭订单收据进行外，其他体验与从国内电商平台购物并无太大区别。\n值得一提的是，亚马逊海外淘的预估关税采用「多退少不补」的原则，结算时支付的预估关税如果比实际关税高，亚马逊后续会提供退款，结算时支付的预估关税如果少于实际关税，亚马逊则不会再额外要求你补款（至少我们目前没有遇到过这种情况）。\n另外如果你是亚马逊的 Prime 会员或者订单金额满 300 元，运费也可以得到豁免。\n\n在支付…",

          "description": "今年的十一假期期间我没有继续宅在家里，而是选择打破两点一线的工作日生活，去探寻不一样的城市和自然美景——当然除了感受异地的人文风景之外，我还有另外一个目的：作为「村长」，为了更好地建设村落而积累更多的「步数」。\n这或许是我第一次因为一款游戏而「运动」。\n\n一个用「步数」建成的「猫猫村」\n比起那些需要不断氪金或者让你看广告的手游，我更喜欢《猫猫村》这种「无负担」的「健康手游」——没有虚拟世界里的激烈竞争，也没有让我沉迷到不可自拔的关卡，整个游戏玩下来的感觉只有一个：原来只要健康生活就可以满足你所建设的这个《猫猫村》中村民们的需求，让这些可爱的「像素猫」可以开心愉悦地生活。\n\n而如何建设你的猫猫村？答案就在自己脚下——尽力地在现实世界中坚持运动来获得步数，就可以用来在游戏中建设房屋、道具、家具等，并以此让猫猫村中村民生活得更惬意，而村民们如果对当前的生活感到满意就会产生「爱心」：这同样也是一种重要的建设资源，随着爱心获取越多，你可以一步步地解锁更高级的建筑以及道具，从而让你的村落设施更全面，进一步地扩大村落吸引更多的村民入住。\n\n我不知道这样以运动步数作为游戏中重要资源的设计是否更符合现代年轻人的「佛系生活方式」，但不得不说《猫猫村》让我们每天的步数有了更多的使用场景，使得每天的运动可能不再仅仅是蚂蚁森林中新增的绿地、微信运动中每日的步数排行榜，或者是 Apple Watch 获得的运动成就徽章……\n\n这款游戏为那些看似日常的运动赋予了一种新的使命感——让自己的努力为游戏中的「他们」带来美好的生活，这又何不是另一种类型的自我心灵疗愈？\n像素画风下的温馨小村\n不仅仅是游戏要素，从画面上《猫猫村》就完全有别于我玩过的任何一款游戏，甚至你可能会觉得它无论在画面上还是设置方面都显得有些「简陋」——八位像素风格的画面，整个场景设计成了横板卷轴，因而整个村落的建设完全是在一个 2D 的平面中进行铺设，甚至在建设玩法上实际更像是在一个线上依次摆设——既不能调整建筑的大小，也不能调整建筑或者家具的位置。\n\n当然对于喜欢像素风游戏的朋友而言，《猫猫村》又是很独特的，类似早年八位机游戏的文本互动方式在现在看来，显得是那么地复古与时尚。\n\n这种画面上的简单让你不由得会想到早年的像素风游戏甚至是那些横板过关的游戏——因此游戏的发展进行或者是场景的解锁都是向两侧进行，比如你可以根据猫猫村民 NPC的提示来扩展村落边界，或者是通过建设不同的建筑来创建更多的子场景，而这些分散的子场景让游戏随着时间推进一步步地变得更加丰富有趣。\n\n每天就玩十分钟：真的不能再多了！\n如果你每天都抽出时间玩上一会儿《猫猫村》，你可能会觉得他是你见过的最「佛系」、最不会让人上瘾的游戏了。\n\n游戏中的玩法其实非常简单，你需要带领一群像素猫猫建立一个自己的村庄，而最初的生产资料就是你每日的步数，我们需要使用步数来兑换最为基础的建筑，比如水井、树等等，通过和猫猫们的共同努力来建设村落中的第一栋房屋。\n\n随着游戏的进行，猫猫们在村落生活的同时开始产生大量的「❤️」，同样作为生产资料，你可以使用「❤️」来安装抵御偷心贼的武器，也可以用来兑换一系列的新建筑，而猫猫 NPC 也会随着时间推移给出相应的建设请求，并一步步地提醒你建设新的建筑与设施。\n\n当你真正上手之后就会发现，实际上整个《猫猫村》的节奏并不快，相比那些几个小时就开始提醒你继续建设的放置类手游，《猫猫村》的平均游玩时间可以说非常短，而我每一次的游戏时间也在十几分钟左右，在完成 NPC 给的小任务之后往往更多的是点触村民猫猫来进行互动。\n\n随着游戏的进行，你可以建造的建筑以及家具就会又来越多，这些建筑物或者家具其实也暗藏玄机，比如你可以使用幸运转盘进行抽奖，甚至你可以通过将记事板放到房间里，并使用密码锁给房间上锁，在猫猫村中撰写你的「私密日记」。\n\n结语\n在上手《猫猫村》之后，我带上村民回到了自己生活的城市，回到了那些用钢铁水泥构筑的森林和那封闭的格子间，好在手机的那一头还有一些用像素构成的小猫在等着我，等着我在疲累的工作之余，和他们简单地来一次互相治愈的游戏。\n\n送码\n你可以在 App Store 免费下载《猫猫村》并游玩前期故事剧情，完整剧情可以通过解锁内购进行获取，售价 25 元。\n在评论区说说你对《猫猫村》的体验、想法和建议，下周一 (11.29) 选 2 位读者赠送《猫猫村》完整剧情内购兑换码。\n \n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "我玩动森已经一年多了，非常肝，目前进度是岛上环境已经达到了五星，博物馆的生物以及艺术品全部收集齐，更新前的大部分 DIY 手册和家具我都拥有了，目前游戏基本上处于一个磨磨蹭蹭岛建的阶段，每天上线 10 分钟左右做完日常任务就下线。虽然还在玩，但是总感觉缺少了最初玩的时候那种激动和新鲜，也缺少了动力。\n很多次我都觉得这个游戏就是目前这样了，单机游戏能玩一年多，我已经很满足了。\n所以当我看到动森更新的消息之后真的非常非常激动，甚至可以没有看 2.0 版本的更新日志，就直接上手玩了，又非常肝地玩了几天。我想，哪怕我不买 DLC，这个游戏我还能再玩个一年多。\n更个性化的岛民服务\n一开始就看到西施惠亲切地播报，说我的小岛可以由岛民代表（也就是我）去改变生活条例，这是一项影响岛的重大决策。改变生活条例属于和西施惠的谈话中「关于岛的方针」的内容，办理条例需要花费 20000 铃钱的协助金，一共包括四种条例，分别是优美岛条例、早鸟条例、夜猫条例、经济复苏条例。\n西施惠介绍说夜猫条例是一项推迟商店结束营业的时间，熬夜并繁荣岛上夜生活的条例，我毫不犹豫就选了这条。因为我确实喜欢熬夜，而且我忙完可以玩动森的时间大多都超过了岛上商店和服装店的营业时间，无法买买卖商品和衣服。我的一位朋友逐渐淡坑的一个很重要的原因就是，等可以玩动森的时候都是深夜，商店也关门了，小动物也睡觉了，一个人孤零零的很无聊。夜猫条例就很便于我这种睡觉时间偏晚的人，也方便白天没有太多时间玩的社畜。\n当然，如果你喜欢早起，可以选择早鸟条例。看到这一点的更新，我真的非常开心，也觉得非常温暖和治愈。这种更新考虑到了不同人的作息时间，可以让大家更自如地选择玩游戏的时间。\n另外优美岛条例与岛的景观有关，经济复苏条例与交易有关。处于游戏其他阶段的朋友可以考虑。\n\n除了西施惠那边的更新，我也和狸克聊了聊。狸克告诉我说房间收纳空间又可以扩容啦，…",

          "description": "大家好，我是沈乐平导演。今天我们《新秦时明月之百步飞剑》正式上线了，今天正好是感恩节，在此首先感恩大家的关注，也和大家做一番交流。很多人关心，我们为什么会在这个时间点推出《秦时明月》的十五周年版？我想说，最主要的原因正是感恩和回馈。\n熟悉秦时明月和玄机的观众都知道，这次的秦时明月十五周年版其实已经是秦时明月第一部的第二次重制。百步飞剑到目前已有三个版本。每一次的重制，我们都将其当作对长久支持我们的观众和粉丝的一份礼物和回馈。\n\n\n其中一个很重要的原因，是我们发现很多月饼不仅自己会经常回顾这部作品，也会向身边的朋友推荐这部曾带给他感动和启发的作品；但确实15年前制作这部动画的技术，从模型的精度甚至到画面的比例，和今天比已不可同日而语。所以这次的秦时明月十五周年版，我们用现在所掌握的最新技术进行了全面优化，以期给大家呈现全新的面貌。通过这些版本的比较，相信大家也能看出玄机在大家支持、鼓励和鞭策下，不断前进，努力做更好的自己。\n\n秦时明月对于玄机的意义是非凡的。应该说玄机在行业中很长一段时间属于比较独特的公司——整整十年时间只做一部作品秦时明月。这一方面是因为行业发展和团队发展的阶段性；但另一方面，通过这样一段时间的沉淀和团队经验累积，我们也更深刻的理解“十年磨一剑”这句话的意义。我们觉得自己很幸运，能够在15周年的时候，有机会和能力再一次重新打磨这部作品。大家可以看到，这部作品相比原来的版本是一个脱胎换骨的升级——从每一个道具、场景的模型，每一个分镜还有动画，包括光影的处理，实际上都是全新的制作。\n\n十五周年版我们内部专门成立了一个极致动画部，主要聚焦动画的表现，如口型、表情、布料物理运算的提升。十五周年版加强的并不是我们已经受肯定较多的场景、建模和光影特效等方面，主要加强的是角色表演的生动性、细腻度和流畅性。这三方面其实不仅仅在角色，更是一个全方位的体现，比如场景，大家可以看…",

          "description": "松露，是个很无厘头的汉语译名。\n\n\n顾名思义，它被比喻为松树凝出的露水。但这种生长在地下的真菌，既不在松树枝干上生长，也不依附松针松根形成的自然生态。橡树、榛树、椴树、榉树、桦树、松树、白杨都可以成为松露的生存环境。松树与松露，从没有必然联系。\n\n\n事实上，直到上世纪80年代，松露在中国的名字依然充满了下里巴人的气息，“土茯苓”“无娘果”“猪拱菌”“臭鸡枞”……松露两字，最早出现在改革开放后的欧美文学译作里。\n\n\n也许在中国的翻译家眼中，最珍贵最美味的食用真菌，天然就应该与松树搭上关系，比如松茸、松树蕈、松蘑、松耳；而露珠本身，则与可食用真菌一样，隐含着无根无蒂、无体无形，采纳天地灵气和日月精华而生的意蕴。\n\n\n一个美丽的名词，从诞生之初，就夹带着狗血的误会。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.1 壹\n\n\n作为一种食物，Truffle准确的译名不是松露，而是“块菌”。从生物学的分类来看，块菌与羊肚菌的亲缘关系很接近，整个欧亚大陆和北美大陆各地，都能出产这种生长在土壤下的真菌。它是一种典型的世界性生物。\n\n\n但东西方对它的态度，却有着天壤之别。西方有着悠久的松露食用史，4000年前，生活在两河流域的苏美尔人，就用楔形文字记载了一个孩子将这种食物献给国王的故事。而到了公元1世纪的古罗马时代，美食家阿比西斯在他的传世名作《厨艺》中，已经详细介绍了松露的吃法：煮熟后串起来，加盐烘烤出焦香；另将葡萄酒、橄榄油、胡椒、蜂蜜、鱼酱和酸葡萄汁一起煮沸，加入淀粉后做成蘸酱；最后在松露上用针刺出小孔，泡进蘸酱里吸取味道。\n\n\n即便到了今天，人工培植相对困难，主要靠野外采集的松露，依然是餐桌上的珍品。但在2000年前，古罗马人已经实现了松露的常态化食用。一方面，贵族的奢靡生活，反映了古代欧洲封建国家的富庶和强大；另一方面，也证明了欧洲人珍视松露的饮食传统。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n在中国，松露的应用就落后很多。上下五千…",

          "description": "开发者来强答一波\n《物理世界》的灵感诞生于CIGA Game Jam 2019上。\n当时的题目是一张这样的图片：\n\n\n\n（看到图片的我亿脸蒙蔽XD）\n但没办法，题还是要做的哇，所以我就在想，这爱心到底怎么插入小人中奖的三角形？\n\n一般正常情况下看到这个问题，肯定是会想到“父母的爱对孩子来说太沉重”，“看起来好的东西不一定适合自己”一类的观点，但可能是我苦于物理荼毒久已，导致我第一时间想到的事居然是——\n\n爱心通过怎样的形态变化能成为三角形，最终契合进小人的内心？我脑内闪过了一万个公式，发现都没有办法解决我的疑惑。\n进而，我联想到了《Baba is you》——一款通过不同的组合方式产生不同的效果，最终解决谜题的作品。\n\n\n\n\n虽然和物理世界不尽相同，但通过不同组合方式，改变角色行动逻辑，最终让角色成功移动到终点的解谜内核触动了我。彼时的我已经把题目图片抛之脑后，满脑子只想的是“我要把各种物理公式嵌进一款解谜游戏中”，让玩家再次体验被物理课堂所支配的......\n就这样，初版的物理世界诞生了。\n\n（老版本的物理世界，当时主角还不是盒娘）\n\n尽管Game Jam很快就结束了，我们对继续制作《物理世界》的热情却丝毫没有熄灭。\n首先，我们决定更换美术素材——黑板的绿底白字让人感觉过于古板，于是我们打算采用更卡通的风格让画面更有活力。\n\n\nGame Jam上制作的版本中的地图的地形均为直接绘制，这不利于后续关卡的搭建和维护。我们首先换用了TileMap插件来搭建地形和绘制方块。但它的自由度不是很高，有些比较不规则的图形无法实现。于是我们又换用了更加自由的SpriteShapeController来编辑地形。\n\n\n继续制作解密游戏最重要的一点就是丰富关卡内容了。为了扩充关卡内容，我们在接下来的时间里制作了更多的关卡，包括摩擦力关卡、浮力关卡、圆周运动关卡以及动量关卡。\n\n 摩擦力关卡\n\n浮力关卡\n\n圆周运动关卡\n\n动量关卡\n一切关卡的设计思路以有趣为前提，为此我们也都是绞尽脑汁，不断迭代我们的作品。\n当内容逐渐丰富之后，游戏主要矛盾逐渐转移到了用户的游玩体验之上。\n在游玩《Baba is you》的过程中，尽管你会被他惊艳的创意所折服，但有时也会莫名其妙的过关弄昏头脑。\n如果玩家与设计者的脑洞没有对上，关卡的乐趣就会骤减，原本精妙的解谜关卡设置在玩家眼中可能会“过于电波系”，让玩家一头雾水，卡关的挫败感也许会让他们不再打开这部作品。\n\n为了解决这样的问题，在设计比较复杂的关卡的时候，我们或有意或无意地留下了多于一种的过关方式。\n\n\n\n\n在这个关卡中，你可以选择黄色和紫色方块中任何一个用于垫脚\n\n我们加入了提示系统以避免避免玩家长时间的卡关导致失去兴趣的情况出现，但于此同时，我们也不会给予玩家包办式的过关引导——玩家依然需要去考虑如何实现提示系统中的各条提示，它们一般都不会太难，只是需要花点时间。\n\n\n同时，为了玩家能够更好地get到我们设计时的脑洞，我们也特地的在靠前的引导关卡中以更简单的方法呈现给玩家。\n\n这个关卡的过关方式中需要用方块将红色小旗撞下来。\n在本作最开始的测试中，许多玩家第一次看到这样的关卡时，往往无法第一时间悟到本关的解谜机制，最终会因为定式思维卡关很久。\n我们注意到了这点，于是在较为前面的关卡中加入了这样的一关来进行引导。\n\n这关需要玩家用蓝色方块将红色小旗撞下\n这样一来，玩家能更容易地理解并利用这样的机制进行解密。\n在游戏进行测试的过程中我们发现，有的玩家在一开始就难以理解这个游戏的机制——用物理公式来控制场上的物体。甚至在第一关就不知所措。于是我们又额外增加了教程关卡来解决这个问题。\n\n\n教程关中通过文字一步步的指导，让玩家了解游戏的机制以及游玩思路——这成功地降低了游戏的上手难度，也让这部作品能够得以有机会被更多用户所看到。\n一起来体验《物理世界》的美妙吧！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n团长大人\n点击下载\n2 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么现在好多单机游戏都做开放世界？\n怪猎世界中有什么整活的流派？",

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n这场比赛的焦点，在于浓眉对字母在攻防两端的表现。相比起字母哥的在球场两端的发挥，浓眉看上去似乎落了下风。“美国杨毅”史密斯怒斥了浓眉的“回击乏力”，虎扑湖人区更是以“浓眉夺冠赛季后的堕落不自律”为主题，进行了心理与身体状态上的大讨论。然而，如果细究比赛进程，从全局出发，浓眉在进攻端还是发挥出了重要的作用，而在防守端对字母的防守丢分，也更多来自于一种体系中定位的无奈。相应地，威少的进攻端表现则受到了沃格尔的表扬，“打出了湖人生涯最好的一场比赛”。\n那么，浓眉的作用是如何发挥的？威少的表现上升，与浓眉有无关联？本场比赛的湖人，是否有一些让人看到一些希望——他们最需要这个，最起码得有“盼头”——的比赛内容呢？\n\n在这支湖人队中，浓眉的防守任务是非常沉重的。在近期的比赛中，湖人常规性地使用了三后卫的阵容。这一排法，当然是为了在现有资源的现实前提下、尽量为威少缓解防守压力。本赛季，威少在防守挡拆持球人时，平均每回合让对手得到0.83分，每场需要完成3.6个回合，占他总防守比例的35.1%.而同队的布拉德利与里弗斯，防守挡拆的回合数比威少还略多0.1和0.2，每回合对手得分只有0.79和0.57分。\n而在防守轮转后的弱侧盯人中，威少也往往难以做出正确的判断----他已经在执行湖人防守体系的换防要求，大量增加了防守中的移动，每个防守回合中的移动距离排名队内第一，并非在每个回合中都是蹲篮下等待篮板的懒散存在，但却由于对进攻阅读的不准、防守沟通的不力，他在移动上往往显得犹犹豫豫、去而复返，无效跑动很多，加上运动能力的消耗，便很难执行出坚决、效率的到位换防，防守端的平均移动速度排名队内倒数第三。这就导致了威少在防守端制造的“窟窿”效果：上场时，对手每百回合可以得到109.9分，而下场后湖人反而压到了103.8分。\n\n威少在场上的正向作用主要是进攻端的球权消化，在防…",

          "description": "平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。\n首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。\n《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。\n其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。\n然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）\n1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。\n\n游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。\n2. 关于形状的错觉。\n\n一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。\n3. 颜色的错觉。\n\n\n这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）\n4. 负空间。\n\n在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。\n5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）\n\n虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。\n6. 倒影或平面变成实体\n\n挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。\n7. 透过遮罩的场景\n\n我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？\n8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方\n\n这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。\n游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。\n第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nmonokura\n点击下载\n53 个回答，查看全部。\n《纪念碑谷》里有哪些难以发现的细节？\n纪念碑谷为什么会火？",

          "description": "《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。\n番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。\n当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。\n至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。\n第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。\n第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。\n最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。\n以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nhaolin\n点击下载\n40 个回答，查看全部。\n动画《时光代理人》已经完结，如何评价这部作品？\n谁是动画史上最糟糕的角色？为什么？",

          "description": "作为《镜》的书粉，能参与《镜》的制作很兴奋，在整个制作中，我们在开发时阶段对原著做了大量调研和规划，努力还原大家眼中的云荒，这个奇幻大陆。\n在设计初始我们考虑到镜是不同于修仙武侠风格的奇幻作品，云荒庞大的世界观本身作为镜系列的一大亮点，在本次的开发中，我们也在美术开发中针对这个亮点进行了系统开发。例如双城这部动画中出现的比较有代表性的空桑族，首先古代空桑作为比较尊贵的种族在服饰的设计上我们采用了比较端庄的广袖交襟制式，也加入了现代剪裁的风格，在服饰材料上采用了大量锦缎。因为锦缎的特点是密实厚重。而在征服海国后的空桑则以束口易于行动，以及绫罗和鲛绡等轻便织物为主。其中白璎的婚服和常服就是比较典型的代表。\n\n中州族在设计，比较有代表性的是我们的主角那笙，整体服饰风格我们借鉴了苗族的银饰、苗绣、蜡染等苗族服饰元素。同时考虑到了中州的人文，当地盛产羽毛动物多以羽毛作为装饰品生产，所以在那笙的头饰设计上我们增加了羽毛饰品。\n\n另外大家比较关心的苏摩所在的鲛人族我们也做了细致的设计，蓝发碧眼是鲛人统一特征，考虑到原著设定鲛人族在创世之初选择了美貌和歌声，所以全员设计上我们都此为重心进行设计。由于鲛人命运的多元性，我们根据每个出现的角色都进行了定制设计，例如苏摩从少年到成年，从送给白璎到离开空桑，再到桃源郡如意赌坊和如意夫人汇合，我们为苏摩设计了三套不一样的服饰，都是根据苏摩当时的境遇而设计。另一个比较有代表性的鲛人角色，炎汐，作为鲛人复国军的左权使，在执行任务的时候需要灵活和轻便的特征，所以我们采用了软皮革材质的盔甲设计，在纹理和结构上采用了鳞片和鱼鳍纹理等鲛人特有的元素。在裁剪上也采用了更加修身的裁剪方式来突出鲛人俊美的特质。 \n\n最后希望大家在《镜·双城》这部动画中感受到不一样的美术设计，同时请大家多多支持镜双城，我们会继续努力的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n张层层\n点击下载\n10 个回答，查看全部。\n如何看待诡秘之主将要动画化?\n如何评价漫画《快把我哥带走》动画化？",

          "description": "两不疑第一季完结在即，也借此机会对项目做个简单的总结梳理，在动画创作、制作上跟大家一起交流下。\n两不疑动画项目从最早的PV开发也就是最早放出的一分半完整版pv短片，到正剧制作流程开发，正剧制作，上线，每周一集供应，周更一直到第一季完结。前后近两年时间，每个阶段都面临不同的困难和问题，而这两年也是纸飞机动画作为传统3D动画团队从开始接触三渲二到研发自己的三渲二视效建立三渲二制作流程的过程。\n回想两年前第一次跟IP方漫漫漫画一起探讨两不疑的动画改编时，第一个面对的问题就是两不疑动画的视效风格是选择3D还是三渲二。\n传统3D视效风格纸飞机本身制作流程成熟，在制作和预算控制上更有把握，而三渲二更适合还原漫画画风，可以给观众带来更贴合原著的体验感，但面临在预算有限的情况下还要从头摸索制作方案和视效风格的问题。\n当时双方一拍即合，三渲二！不论是画风、故事、角色塑造以优先还原原著为第一位。\n\n两不疑如果要做动画就要给漫画粉丝呈现一个她们期待中的两不疑动画。预算不足的问题通过延长PV开发周期来解决，给制作组一个较长时间来研究和适应新风格，利用其他项目的间歇来解决三渲二技术开发并完成PV制作。\n最终1分30秒的PV用了9个月的时间制作完成，通过PV开发制作组熟悉了三渲二的制作方案也对两不疑的画风建立了了解。\n\n徐钰美术设定\n\n徐钰角色资产lookdev\n\n国师面部阴影开发\n随着pv上线，两不疑正剧的前期工作也正式展开，在我个人的经验中长篇动画的创作生产与短片、CG有着本质的区别。一部能达到及格线的长篇动画首先考验的是各个核心主创环节的专业性和配合度，确立分工配合！\n由B站的监制老师把控整体方向，IP方漫漫漫画负责整体项目制片，两不疑漫画编辑以及原作者负责剧本原著方向把控，避免人物ooc，提供剧本修改的解决方案，纸飞机负责导演和执行制片及全片制作。\n呼，松了口气，终于不用担心我一个直男导演一不小心把两不疑改成少年热血番了。\n\nOk!原著漫画有好的故事基础，人物塑造到位，又有原作者帮忙把控原著方向，不用担心跑偏。那剩下的就是导演技术型工作了。\n如何将原著较为片段化的桥段和情节串联起来，如何把原著的故事讲的更有趣更有悬念，如何让观众更好的代入故事和了解认同角色，是否有原著中被省略或可以扩展的情节能提出来做点小原创发挥玩一下，可以说整个改编的工作更像是导演基础技巧训练。\n正剧前期工作推进的同时，针对两不疑剧集的三渲二流程也同步在研发中。与PV短片的制作流程不同，在短片中更关注如何实现三渲二的最终画面效果，角色、场景资产的制作会根据镜头的需要来规划和实现效果。到了剧集首先要解决大规模生产协作和制作成本优化问题，所有制作方案和效果必须建立统一的制作规则和尽量实现全流程的工具化操作。\n\n\n\n由于整个项目本身预算不高，为了在有限的预算和档期内尽量达到最佳效果，两不疑项目的整个制作过程中一直在镜头设计、制作方案和最终效果上寻找平衡点。在镜头设计上减少非必要的与故事表达无关的运动镜头，尽量使用固定机位镜头来进行叙事，一些常规的镜头运动采取2D动画的后期运镜方式，把更多的设计精力和预算放在构图把控和镜头节奏剪辑上。\n\n在动画上，项目早期也测试过动作捕捉方案，动作捕捉对剧集动画有着生产速度更快，生产周期更好把控的优势。但写实的动画风格跟两不疑不搭，而两不疑里的文戏、情感戏占比较多，对动画表演的准确度和关键表演细腻程度要求很高，最终为了更好的呈现两不疑的风格还是选择了全片使用传统手key动画。\n\n超过240分钟手工动画带来的问题就是，需要寻找大量外包合作的动画团队和动画师一起协作参与制作。如何控制动画成本？如何让各个团队统一动画表演风格？如何应对参差不齐的动画质量和海量的动画反馈？\n解决的关键在layout！\n在3Dlayout 环节导演要确定所有创作和角色关键表演信息，避免在大规模制作生产环节进行创作和修改。为了做到这一点两不疑的3Dlayout全部由纸飞机内部的动画师和有多个项目配合经验的合作方完成，在这个阶段进行大量互动沟通和反馈来确定镜头构图及表演创作，同时也参考了传统2D动画的故事板和原画流程，用尽量少的关键帧来确定镜头构图和角色的表演。\n\n\n虽然关键帧较少，但每个关键帧从角色POSE到表演状态上都达到最终的动画表演级别，用少量关键帧卡准表演的关键节奏点。这样来避免在进入正式的动画的生产环节因设计不确定而产生的大量重复性修改及损耗，也便于控制整个动画中期的质量和统一风格。\n\n以上是两不疑项目中我个人感觉一定有代表性的经验和问题，简单的整理下分享给大家，也欢迎对两不疑和三渲二感兴趣的朋友一起多多交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n王丰彬\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价电视剧《两不疑》?\n如何评价漫画《两不疑》？",

          "description": "谢邀\n我从以下四个方面解答这个问题：\n\n1、香型的由来\n2、香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌\n3、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n4、香型如此多，我们怎么选？\n\n一、香型的由来：\n酒自诞生开始，就有香味的区别，不同地域、不同技艺，形成了各自的代表酒。但在1979年以前，中国白酒是不分香型，统称为蒸馏酒。\n香型正式区分，是1979年在大连召开的全国名优白酒协作会议及第三届全国评酒会上提出的，在第三届大会的时候分别从气味、成分、微生物、酿造工艺等方面综合评价：确认了5类香型：清香、浓香、酱香、米香、其他香型（不属于其他香型的统统归在这）。\n随后，经过进一步研究，扩展为12种香型：\n清香型、浓香型、酱香型、米香型、兼香型、药香型、凤香型、特香型、芝麻香型、老白干、馥郁香和豉香型。\n\n二、各个香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌。\n香型的名称应该反映出本香型产品的个性和内涵，但是香型的划分并不统一：\n有的按照香味的浓烈程度来判断：比如浓香型，判断标准是酒体中的窖香突出。\n有的根据香味所体现的口感特征来判断：比如酱香型，判断标准酱香、焦香、糊香的复合香气。\n还有以产品名称来划分：比如凤香型、老白干香型，特香型。\n为了统一标准，要求必须在每个香型后面加入其工艺、风味特征的描述，于是有了下图：\n\n三、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n为什么中国的白酒香型如此之多？\n总的来说分为以下原因：\n1、历史原因：\n中国多次民族分裂和民族融合，使我国成为多民族文化共存的国家，各民族的地理环境、风俗习惯，饮食习惯的差异，各地人口味千差万别，形成了“食有千种，味有千样”的华夏饮食体系，由此体系衍生出来的白酒，就变成多种香型共存的口感需求。\n2、技术发展：\n由于生产工艺的创新发展，酿造原料的多样性，各个区域形成了特色、风格不同的各种香型的白酒，加上地理环境的差异性，导致不同区域的酒曲、窖泥、酒醅和地域环境，都对微生物有不同的影响，从而影响到发酵的速度，香味，口感等。\n四、面对种类如此多的香型，我们应该怎么选择？\n（1）如果你之前没有喝过白酒，但是最近想开始试着接触白酒，那我建议你可以从清香、米香开始，这两个香型，口感比较淡，入口绵顺柔和，舒适度高，刺激性较弱，有利于给初次接触的人，留下一个好印象。\n我推荐汾酒和三花两个品牌的中端酒，这样能提升白酒的好感度、趣味性和持续性。\n比如这款老白汾15：\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/9ce8fdbdc0133fa79cfe34337ead254c?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n（2）如果你已经接触了一段时间白酒了，那我推荐你看看各知名品牌，在这我也推荐几款虽然名气比不上一线，但是酒质和性价比绝对划算的品牌，这几款酒一定可以让你惊艳。\n酱香：年份潭酒、金质、丹泉。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/c0015374386b79f17e3795fecfe84c87?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n浓香：丰谷、五粮春、泸特、金剑南\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/df5d7945012c7e7275e1e56ca47ef7b9?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：口子窖\n（3）如果你是老酒鬼，那就看看下面这些公认的性价比高的口粮酒吧。\n清香：汾酒、红星、牛栏山。\n浓香：双沟圣坊、文君、今世缘（单开、对开）、丰谷酒王10。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/8116e263867e34fc8715090921f95010?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n酱香：金质、金酱、武陵少酱、金沙回星。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/4d01d2a2702995759d67b86e17cc24bf?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：白云边15年、口子窖6年。\n特香：东方弘韵。\n食有千种，味有千样，喝酒重要的不是香型，而是喝酒气氛、讲出来的故事、带动的情绪，饮酒之趣，在于不同时间、不同环境，喝酒体验大相径庭。\n如果你觉得文章让你进一步了解白酒的香型，请点个赞再走吧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知酒浓\n点击下载\n256 个回答，查看全部。\n有哪些 酱香型、浓香型、清香型、兼香型白酒适合做口粮的？\n酱香型、清香型、浓香型等白酒究竟有哪些区别？",

          "description": "首先丰收的是秋粮，那么\n全国秋粮作物主要包括哪些？\n朱娟（农业农村部种植业管理司农情信息处处长）：秋粮作物主要是玉米、中晚稻、还有大豆，另外还有一些春小麦和杂粮、杂豆，这里面的玉米大概占了52%左右，中晚稻占了37%，大豆占了4%，\n大家很关心一个问题，夏粮和早稻都丰收了，但是我们知道像河南等地遭遇了暴雨洪涝灾害的影响，那么这种灾情对全国的秋粮生产（影响）有多大？\n自然灾害对秋粮影响有多大\n朱娟：确实正如您所说，今年极端天气比较多，局部像河南灾情确实比较重，但是整个全国面上的灾情总体偏轻。这里有两组数据，我给大家介绍一下，一个是重灾区的面积占秋粮（总面积）的整体比例是比较小的，今年受灾比较重的主要是集中在两个区域，一个是河南受涝，另外一个就是西北受旱，那河南大家也知道，“7·20”极端暴雨洪涝灾害，造成河南农作物受灾是一千五百多万亩，其中秋粮是一千一百多万亩，占到河南秋粮面积的14%左右，但是从全国来看，它仅占全国秋粮面积的1%左右。\n所以这个大家一定要清楚，大家一想河南它是粮食生产大省，但其实从秋粮这个角度来看，它的占比在全国的占比并不高。\n朱娟：而且河南的秋粮，还有六千五百多万亩没有受灾的秋粮，这部分作物长势不错，可以做到以丰补歉。另一块区域就是西北的受旱区域，西北陕西、甘肃、宁夏今年旱情比较重，受旱面积最大的时候达到了一千九百多万亩，这个占到全国秋粮面积大概1.5%左右，但是这里面因为它西北杂粮、杂豆的占比比较高，所以它是属于这种低产作物，对整个全国秋粮产量的影响也是很有限的。\n那么除去这些受灾的地区，其他的整体上来看，没有受灾的地区秋粮长势怎么样？\n朱娟：在秋粮生长发育期内大部分地区，光、温、水匹配比较好，就没有发生这种流域性的、区域性的、大范围的旱涝灾害，从我们调度的情况，6月以来，就是秋粮的主要生长发育期内，是近十年同期受灾是最轻的一年，特别是东北地区，今年雨水多，旱情非常轻，也没有发生像去年秋收前这种连续三个台风的袭击，所以东北今年是个大丰收年。\n从敏芳那边的自己种植的情况来看，你们今年的水稻种植的过程当中，有没有遇到一些灾害性天气的影响？因为湖南也是水稻种植大省。\n董敏芳：其实我们在种植过程当中，今年的早稻倒是碰上了“倒春寒”，但是通过我们的科学化种植，科技兴农我们采用的旱地育秧，有效地保障了秧苗的品质，我们是有效地防范了“倒春寒”的影响，所以对于我们的产量来讲没有造成影响。\n今年秋粮丰收不容易\n朱娟：今年秋粮克服了局部极端的洪涝、干旱以及病虫害重发等等不利因素，再获丰收非常不容易，今年秋粮面积，在去年已经增加了八百七十多万亩的基础上，今年进一步增加达到12.9亿亩以上。这是奠定了丰收的基础。今年国家继续实施稻谷、小麦最低收购价政策，而且把最低收购价提高了一分钱，此外扩大了玉米、大豆生产者补贴的资金的规模，还首次安排一次性实际种粮农民补贴资金总额达到200亿元，直接支持粮食生产的扶持政策，资金规模也进一步扩大，我们统计了一下，是增加了六十多亿元。农业农村部在关键农时派出了二十多个专家组和工作组，赴主产省指导生产。\n在河南洪涝灾情发生后，中央财政安排专项资金，支持农业抗灾救灾。农业农村部第一时间组织专业力量指导抗灾救灾。调用两千多台抽水泵、组织5.8万农机手帮助重灾区抽排田间积水。派出22个专家小分队带物资、带技术，蹲点指导灾后改种补种。协调周边省份，捐赠救灾种子等农资，满足灾后改种补种的需要。绝收的五百多万亩秋粮，有一半进行了改种补种，挽回了部分损失。\n在秋粮收获时，黄淮海地区遭遇极端天气影响，特别是山西陕西等地洪涝灾情严重。农业农村部立即组织专家组，指导当地抢收抢种。黄淮海地区的秋粮作物主要是玉米，据农情调度，截至目前，山西秋粮收获进度2/3左右。陕西秋粮收获进度3/4以上。两省反映，“十一”强降雨发生的时候，两省秋粮产量已基本形成，灾害对产量影响是有限的。农业农村部宣布，今年秋粮增产已成定局，秋粮面积稳中有增，目前收获已近8成。近期的连阴雨对产量影响总体有限，全年粮食产量将再创历史新高，连续7年保持在1.3万亿斤以上。\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国三农发布\n点击下载\n109 个回答，查看全部。\n我们中国的粮食真的是年年增长吗？\n国家粮食储备库是干嘛的呢？",

          "description": "大家好，我是震雷的孙猛，此次《识夜描银》改编动画的导演。\n我是在2018年末开始思考《识夜描银》的动画改编工作的。我的第一件工作，就是作为系列构成，去寻找这个故事到底要讲什么。\n作为文学影视作品，不单单的讲流水线式的剧情，而是深度发掘其内在的精神内核，将其想表达的东西传达给观众，引起观众思考，反思，回味，是本次改编的重点意义所在。\n为此我与原作进行了很多交流，也得到了很多来自作者的创作资料，从而更好，更全面的了解了故事的全貌和内核。\n\n\n“这个世界所有的力量，源自于信仰。\n这句话可以说，是本作最核心的原则，心存善念，就会带来吉祥，心存恶念，就会招致毁灭。\n看似唯心主义的东西，其实是体现了非常传统的东方思想，原作者在《识夜描银世界规律》一文中写道，”规律孕育万物，从草木变成人，有了众生，众生对大自然有了敬畏，产生了信仰，信仰缔造了神明，赋予了神明神权“，这是非常传统的老子道家思想的演化，非常中国味，同时也充满了哲理。这也是本作最打动我的地方。原作漫画里这一点表现的比较隐晦，所以在动画的改编过程中，这一点将作为中心思想，贯穿始终。\n在这一点的基础上引申下去的话，也可以引出很多方面的反思，神明是人造的，人们又回过头去崇拜那个神明，将权利交付与他们，甘心受其统治，谁也没见过上天，但自我塑造出了天子，并将全部权利交付于他统治自己。不过太过深入的话，我觉得可能会跑偏到民主政治和独裁政治的讨论上去，那样的话也许会给本作招来不必要的麻烦，要不就算了吧（笑）。\n\n\n在世界观上，本作和一般的武侠，玄幻类作品相比，也有着一个非常重大区别，那就是对于所谓的“鬼”这个概念的阐述。在绝大部分的此类作品，在这一点上都没有能够突破传统，而本作在这一点上，有着非常有深刻意义的设定，那就是这世界上没有鬼，而人是有灵魂的，人的灵魂分成三份，天魂，地魂，人魂。人死之后，天魂归天，地魂入地，人魂消散，归于虚无。这一…",

          "description": "我该如何安装一款插件？ \n简介\n插件开启（需要同时在MarginNote 3的插件面板开启，并且确保文档界面的放大镜图标已被激活）后，选中任何英文单词（3个单词以内）会自动打开欧路词典并搜索该词。\n这个插件最适用的使用平台是iPhone！用了就知道多爽\n虽然也可以在macOS上使用，但由于在macOS上选词后欧路词典会成为first responder（不知道咋翻译，可以理解为欧路词典会被激活？），再回到MN需要多一次单击，所以不推荐在macOS使用。\n设计这款插件的初衷\n使用场景\n阅读英文材料需要查阅词典时，哪里不会点（选中）哪里，省下了打字或复制粘贴的时间。\n痛点需求\n【痛点0】英语不好\n其他说明\n本插件是【第三方MN插件】#Ver.0.1# ReResearch——自动在外部浏览器搜索选中内容 的一个特殊版本。因为欧路词典搜单词这个需求比较简单具体，就单独拎出来申请了签名。\n，但哪怕有一位用户需要的话，申请签名至少能帮他免掉恼人的弹窗。\n单独给这个小功能申请签名有点不要脸，我本来是想给ReResearch申请签名的，那个插件理论上更强大更实用更灵活。但目前其灵活性建立在用户自己修改代码的基础上，这显然不应该。我希望用户不接触代码就可以自己选择用Google还是百度或者其他URL Scheme，但这需要在开发文档面世之后我才能思考怎么实现。\n使用方法\n录屏\n\nhttps://bbs-upload.marginnote.cn/original/2X/b/b6dbc74ddaadebb188d2023c7f0d188759719b80.m4v\n    \n  \n\n最新版本下载\nSearchInEudic.mnaddon (4.1 KB)\n兼容性\n3.6.8 及更新版本\n更新日志：\nV1.0\n添加官方签名，避免弹窗警告。\n修改ReResearch代码，添加选中内容过滤，只允许搜索3个英文单词和四个汉字以内的内容。",

          "description": "我该如何安装一款插件？ \n简介\n我相信大家都期待着插件控制面板，期待着自定义，然而 MN 官方迟迟不作为，这么个最基本的需求都不解决，还想做插件，真是可笑，发布一些可以说是简单甚至是简陋的插件就没有了下文。\n\n\nimage2688×1952 791 KB\n\n\n使用方法\nOhMyMN 的 设计理念 是通过高度自定义的设置来对摘录进行无感处理，让你觉得一切都是那么自然。OhMyMN 专注于 摘录，评论，标题，卡片 的相关处理，有且只有两种触发方式，一是摘录时自动触发，二是选中卡片（可多选）后点击按钮执行指定操作，避免了一切误触的可能性（我甚至提供了双击展开控制面板的选项）。 查看使用文档 \n插件开发说明\nohmymn 作为插件面板，本身就是多个插件的集合，如果你认同我的设计理念，那么你可以为 ohmymn 开发插件，使得 ohmymn 更加强大。当然你也可以另起炉灶，毕竟 ohmymn 已经踩过了大部分的坑。更多开发相关请自行前往 Github 仓库。ohmymn 项目已经实现了全部 TS 化以及模块化，这里要感谢 mn-addon-api 以及 obsidian-bridge 这两个项目。欢迎大家一起参与进来，尽管目前 ohmymn 插件化做得还不算很好。\n最新下载与文档：https://busiyi.notion.site/OhMyMN-wiki-74ac16d09d17420391b8ffb0dd8cab01\n最新 v2.0.0 已签名：\nohmymn_v2.0.0.mnaddon (39.9 KB)\nGithub\nGithub 仓库：https://github.com/ourongxing/ohmymn\n请不要使用 ohmymn 作为开发模板，ohmymn 并没有对此做任何优化，可能会出现冲突，但很欢迎参与 ohmymn 的插件开发，这也是一件很有趣的事情。我已经基于 ohmymn 制作出了开发模板，欢迎尝试。",

It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. \n\nI saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.\n\nHalo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. \n\nSo again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release\n\n\nSUPPORT the Channel ► https://www.patreon.com/TheActMan \n\n____TIME STAMPS____\nIntroduction – 0:00 \nDisappointing News – 4:03\nLack of Content – 7:23\nGame Modes & Playlists – 11:08 \nCustom Games are Broken – 20:05\nFinal Thoughts – 28:33\n\n✪ CONNECT WITH ME ✪ \nSubscribe ↪ https://www.youtube.com/c/TheActMan?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter ➤ https://twitter.com/TheActMan_YT \nAct Man TV ➤ http://bit.ly/2kPXk7f  \n\nDiscord ➤ https://discord.gg/yBABtkh  \nInstagram ➤ https://www.instagram.com/theactman_yt/ \nXbox Live Gamertag ➤ The Act Man",

With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.\n\nAbout Peacock: The streaming service from NBCUniversal that’s as free as a bird. Current hits. Timeless classics. Timely updates. Stream Now With Peacock, stream current hits, hundreds of movies, thousands of episodes of TV shows, and exclusive Originals – plus timely news, live sports, WWE, and daily pop culture.
