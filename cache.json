This is a high level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.\nVanilla JavaScript is a name to refer to using Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.\nJS is a widely-used programming language used on both the client-side and server-side to make web pages interactive.\nJavaScript can be used for the following:\n Adding interactive behaviour to web pages.\n Creating web and mobile applications.\n Building web servers and developing server applications.\n Game Development\nTypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. TypeScript, also known as TS, is a superset of JavaScript(JS) complied to JavaScript. In short, TS is JS plus more additional features.\n TypeScript is just JavaScript. You only need to know JS to work with TS. This is because all your TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript for execution.\n TypeScript supports other JS libraries; Therefore, TypeScript-generated JS can reuse all existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.\n JS files are TS files. This simply means that any valid .js file can be *renamed *to .ts and complied with other TS files.\n TypeScript is portable. TS can run on any environment that JS runs on, and it can be across browsers, devices, operating systems, etc.... TypeScript doesn't need a dedicated VM or a specific run time environment to execute.\n\nThe benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript includes:\n Supports Class and Modules.\n Static Type-checking\n ES6 Feature Support\n Clear Library API definition.\n Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging.\n Superset of JavaScript\n\nAs TypeScript is an Object-Oriented Language, it makes the code more reusable, simple, clean and consistent. So it is highly recommended to start using TypeScript for building a huge project. This will come in handy. However, vanilla JavaScript can be used for smaller coding projects for better practice.",

          "description": "For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.\nAvailable in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:\nconst { randomUUID } = require(\"crypto\");\nrandomUUID(); // \"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\nIt's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!\nYou can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.",

          "description": "What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in react?\n\n\nTo put simply, controlled components have their data being handled with a react component whereas an uncontrolled component's data is being handled with the DOM itself. Let's dig into this answer a bit more though starting at the basics and including a few visual examples. \nForm elements are rendered with HTML within React components where data is being accessed and manipulate. When we are discussing uncontrolled and controlled components these are terms that are specifically discussing the way in which the form created is handling and accessing that said data. The data handling can be done a few different ways but is commonly seen using typed elements like, <input> and <textarea> or selected elements such as…",

But learning AWS is made more challenging when you're also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. \nIn simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. \nStacks can be stood up manually. However, it's better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…",

These are quickly becoming standard features for many web apps, and tools like Slate make them easier to implement, ensuring your program won’t get bogged down in complexity.\nAlthough Slate is still in beta at the time of writing, it’s natural to ask whether it has the potential to replace more mature platforms like Quill and Draft.js.

I have too, and that's why on more than one occasion I've wondered how it worked that got me out of troubles.\nOkay! to start with this:\nHTML stands for (hypertext markup language) that although many call it \"programming language\" should insist to stop considering it as such, because it is something even more magical is a \"markup language\" because it organizes how a document will be, what elements compose it, in short it is like making a Word document for the Internet.\nAs I have said so far, HTML is a markup language and not a scripting language, but what does this mean? It means that it is enclosed between tags (angle brackets), so it would look like this a :\n<tag>content</tag>\n\nHowever this is not always the case, there are tags that do not need the enclosing tag, for example :\n<img>\n\nBut that's not all... we can... add... ATTRIBUTES! YES! just as you read ATTRIBUTES! but what are they? they are like \"upgrades\" of the tags that allow them to get superpowers to improve their capabilities.\n<tag attribute=\"value\">content</tag>.\n\nIt seems interesting, doesn't it?

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nHave you ever wondered how search engines like Google, fetch data from different parts of the web and serve it to you as a user, based on your query? The method used by applications like this is termed crawling. \nSearch engines work and by crawling and indexing billions of web pages using different web crawlers called web spiders or search engine bots. What these web spiders do is follow links from each web page that have been indexed to discover new ages.\nIn this short article, you will be building out your own web crawler using Python and its popular web framework for extracting the data you need from websites.\nAlso, in this tutorial, developers tend to be confused with web crawling and web scraping.

Looking at the given design, the different regions of content had a natural flow from mobile to desktop. So, I only need Flexbox. If the layout had massive changes  or swap places, then CSS Grid would have been a better tool\nMy tip to anyone is use background colors to visually show specific layout areas. \nGIF of responsive layout\n\nScreen-shot of the Layout\n\nThe next step was to slowly add in all content with relevant HTML tags, no styling. The idea is to purely focus on content placement and using the right HTML tags.\nScreen shot of app in development, no styling\n\nNow for the long grind of adding styles to each HTML tag, section by section, while checking every few changes for layout responsiveness. \nThe one thing I didn't know how to do was to set multiple background images at the same time. \nScreenshot of CSS code for setting multiple background images\n\n\nYou can play with the solution here\nI learned how to add multiple background images at one time. \nI was able to complete this project in a few hours by following a tried and true process: \nDesign a responsive layout\nBuild a foundation with HTML\nAdd content\nStyle with CSS, section by section\nEnd with functionality (JavaScript & CSS animation/transitions)\nThis \"Ground up\" methodology kept me focused, minimized bugs, and follow the mantra \"Slow is Fast\".   \nTips on Background Images  by CSS Tricks\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "Mensah Alkebu-Lan\nPrerequisites\nDiscussion\nReferences\nSome familiarity with the JavaScript programming language.\nArrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. There are countless use cases in Web Development where arrays will be useful.\nThe Array.prototype.filter() method creates a new filtered array containing all of the elements in the array that pass the test implemented by the provider function. This provider function can be an arrow function taking an element of the array as input and a boolean pass/fail as output.  To clarify, if the output is true the element will be included in the new filtered array. As with most methods in JavaScript, there is considerable flexibility in how they are implemented. For example, instead of an arrow function, the filter method can also take a callback function that returns true or false.\nBelow is a typical example of how the filter function is used:\nvar arr1 = [1,2,3,4],\n    arr2 = [2,4],\n    res = arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item));\n\nconsole.log(res);\n\nWhen this program is executed, the result should be [1,3]. That is, for each of the elements is arr1, the provider function is going to check whether the array [2,4] includes that item. If the element is neither 2 nor 4, it will be added to the filtered array. \n Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter.

After hours of searching for issues on GitHub, I suddenly remembered the first repository where I made my first pull request, Telescope. Since then, the project has undergone many changes with different features and bug fixes, so I think it is time to make another contribution.\nA quick overview about Telescope: it is a web server and application developed by professors and students at Seneca College to track students/faculties' blogs about anything open-source. \nFor my task, I had to customize Telescope's build log page to match the design and layout of the main dashboard, specifically:\nAdd header and side navigation bar\nChange side navigation default logo into Telescope logo\nUpdate link in side navigation logo to redirect to ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Working on the issue\n\n\nAfter setting up the development environment using Telescope's documentation, I began looking at the UI to figure out what I should do. Lucky for me, there was also a different issue that addressed the dashboard page UI, so I decided to use that as a reference.\nI began by adding each UI component one by one, re-rendering the page every time I added in new code to make sure I didn't break anything. Once I was satisfied with my changes, I opened up a pull request on Telescope, explaining what I did and providing screenshots of the result. \nSince I was referencing another issue, I had to keep track of the updated changes in the other PR and update mine accordingly. The other PR also had many requested changes, so I tried my best to read through all the reviews, adding comments when I needed help and clarification to ensure that I wouldn't break or miss anything.\nSimilar to the other PR, when this post is online, the PR is currently under review. I will constantly keep an eye on new notifications regarding this PR and add more commits if needed.\nCheers! 🍻",

I then had to prepare for a couple meetings I had today. Between meetings, I learned about Django and some of key differences between Django and Flask.\nAt the surface level, it seems like Django is ideal for quickly getting a small project off the ground, while Flask is better and more flexible in larger projects.\nI will discuss Django more after I learn more about it. I am still considering building my next app in Django instead of Flask, if only to learn it.\nI also spent some time on the artist app today. I made a mistake with some git commands and, long story short, I ditched a week's worth of changes. \nA little disheartening, but I was considering trying a different tact for constructing the main page, so I'm not too upset about it. \nA clean slate, a new approach!\nI am going to spend some time tomorrow planning the final approach for the artist app. I have already designed most of the elements using React bootstrap, it's really only the structure of the page that I will be focusing on. \nComplicated state management between components.

I'm in the midst of the Ruby Path at The Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I've been working on building a game of Mastermind, which is easily the most complicated thing I've had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I'll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 \nSince this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I'm visiting my family back home. But other than that, I plan to keep on schedule barring some intense illness or emergency. Looking forward to expanding my skills and getting on a new career path 💯",

While the linting itself was not a problem, I ran into some serious dependency tree errors and really got lost in the forest of it. Solving these errors was a really long winded process and it ate up a lot of the time I had set aside for working. In the future, I will need to be much more careful when setting dependencies; I didn't realize how convoluted it could get to fix.\nAs is usual, Tuesday is my busiest day of the week and this Tuesday will be no exception. My plans are to continue with FreeCodeCamp's tutorials and any spare time I get to work on my project will be a blessing.\nDealing with dependencies in React.

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n这场比赛的焦点，在于浓眉对字母在攻防两端的表现。相比起字母哥的在球场两端的发挥，浓眉看上去似乎落了下风。“美国杨毅”史密斯怒斥了浓眉的“回击乏力”，虎扑湖人区更是以“浓眉夺冠赛季后的堕落不自律”为主题，进行了心理与身体状态上的大讨论。然而，如果细究比赛进程，从全局出发，浓眉在进攻端还是发挥出了重要的作用，而在防守端对字母的防守丢分，也更多来自于一种体系中定位的无奈。相应地，威少的进攻端表现则受到了沃格尔的表扬，“打出了湖人生涯最好的一场比赛”。\n那么，浓眉的作用是如何发挥的？威少的表现上升，与浓眉有无关联？本场比赛的湖人，是否有一些让人看到一些希望——他们最需要这个，最起码得有“盼头”——的比赛内容呢？\n\n在这支湖人队中，浓眉的防守任务是非常沉重的。在近期的比赛中，湖人常规性地使用了三后卫的阵容。这一排法，当然是为了在现有资源的现实前提下、尽量为威少缓解防守压力。本赛季，威少在防守挡拆持球人时，平均每回合让对手得到0.83分，每场需要完成3.6个回合，占他总防守比例的35.1%.而同队的布拉德利与里弗斯，防守挡拆的回合数比威少还略多0.1和0.2，每回合对手得分只有0.79和0.57分。\n而在防守轮转后的弱侧盯人中，威少也往往难以做出正确的判断----他已经在执行湖人防守体系的换防要求，大量增加了防守中的移动，每个防守回合中的移动距离排名队内第一，并非在每个回合中都是蹲篮下等待篮板的懒散存在，但却由于对进攻阅读的不准、防守沟通的不力，他在移动上往往显得犹犹豫豫、去而复返，无效跑动很多，加上运动能力的消耗，便很难执行出坚决、效率的到位换防，防守端的平均移动速度排名队内倒数第三。这就导致了威少在防守端制造的“窟窿”效果：上场时，对手每百回合可以得到109.9分，而下场后湖人反而压到了103.8分。\n\n威少在场上的正向作用主要是进攻端的球权消化，在防…",

          "description": "平时不用知乎，但是在朋友的强烈建议下我注册了个知乎账号想回答一下这个问题。\n首先回答一下《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》的不同之处。\n《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者都是非常好的游戏，在《笼中窥梦》发售后也一直被说像这俩游戏。从我个人而言，《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》没有什么特别大的共同点。如果要说有，那可能是最早期的一个拼接通路的正交视角的游戏原型，不过我们当时觉得这个Stencil Buffer的效果可以做的更有意思一些，想尝试一些更有挑战性的设计，就完全舍弃了这个想法。《画中世界》是我特别喜欢和尊敬的作品，可以说《画中世界》开创了一种全新的玩法，我也经常听到有人说我们游戏是3D版的《画中世界》，这其实对我们来说是一种褒奖和认可。\n其实我们的游戏出发的概念和两者都不太一样，我们想象的是，在我们所处的世界，有好多个不同的空间叠加了起来，而通过立方体的窗口，可以窥探到叠加着的其中一个空间。而通过特定的角度观察多个空间，可以看到一些物件能够拼接起来，形成联动。从结果上来看，它类似于一个空间上的拼图，但是运用到了很多的视错觉因素，如近大远小，负空间，形状认知，颜色认知等等。另外由于交互机制的引入，使得我们游戏在游玩的时候更像是密室逃生类的游戏，有时候除去对图形形状的高敏感度之外，还需要“灵光一闪”，甚至是一定的逻辑思维。\n然后说一下游戏中运用到的各种各样的视错觉的地方，举一些小例子，也就是如何欺骗眼睛的地方。如果大家仔细观察了这些地方的话，应该也可以感受到《笼中窥梦》和《纪念碑谷》《画中世界》两者的不同。（以下内容可能会对剧透敏感的玩家造成伤害，顺带一提我也是对剧透神经质的人哈哈哈）\n1. 首先是游戏中几乎每个拼接都会有的视差错觉（维持透视的近大远小）。\n\n游戏中的所有拼接都有一定程度上的视差，这样才能保证只能在一个特定的角度重合拼接。如上图的两个台灯，从摄像机视角看是完全重合的，而其他视角看都无法重合。\n2. 关于形状的错觉。\n\n一个经典的圆方转换，对游戏的谜题没有任何影响，也不太明显，但就是看着好玩。\n3. 颜色的错觉。\n\n\n这个应该是较难的一个谜题，需要让夜晚环境色浸染黄电池，黄电池就可以变成蓝电池。其实在夜晚场景中还是黄电池，但是一旦移到上面，环境色发生变化而电池最终可见颜色没发生变化，夜晚的黄电池就看上去变成蓝电池了。（有点类似于白金蓝黑裙？反正就是环境对物体颜色判断的影响）\n4. 负空间。\n\n在拼接的时候，被一些框架结构限制住，在框架结构内形成的实体。\n5. 大小的错觉（本质还是近大远小）\n\n虽然有很多拼接都有，但大部分都是一个单纯的拼接，而真正运用到的地方是喷泉那儿。很多玩家也不理解水为什么会变多，这个其实就是一个大小的错觉，可以想象如果不是水，而是一个球，沿着这个水管运动，每运动一周，球的体积就会变大一倍，这也是可以无限变多的原因。\n6. 倒影或平面变成实体\n\n挺常见的一个梗，也是运用在了谜题里。\n7. 透过遮罩的场景\n\n我个人特别喜欢的一段剧情，透过杯子可以看到不一样的东西。严格来说不算是视错觉，算是一个酷炫的视觉效果？\n8. 类似“不可能三角形”的地方\n\n这个可能是唯一一个我觉得在游戏里可以找到的有《纪念碑谷》影子的拼接，但也没有实际谜题的作用，只是好玩。\n游戏里还有挺多有趣的东西，希望大家可以去玩一玩。\n第一次发，可能格式很奇怪，文笔也不好，如果写的不是很清楚的，望轻喷。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nmonokura\n点击下载\n53 个回答，查看全部。\n《纪念碑谷》里有哪些难以发现的细节？\n纪念碑谷为什么会火？",

          "description": "《时光代理人》中的部分角色是有原型参考的。比如第八集出场的董易就是《百妖谱》系列导演的原名原姓，甚至连造型都是照着我们董导复刻的。徐姗姗虽然是虚构角色，但他俩的情感故事灵感也是来源于现实——董导他经常会去同济大学讲课，所以一想到让董导去动画“客串”时，就牢牢锁定了校园作为情节展开的场景。\n番外篇中，思文和欧阳的故事灵感也是源自很早以前看过一篇关于“包办婚姻导致悲剧”的报道，有感而发想描写一对对感情忠贞不移的恋人。而很巧的是，我们公司的欧阳时堃导演和刘思文导演是大学好友，四年同窗同寝，到了公司也几乎每天“出双入对”，被誉为“欧文CP”。于是在构思角色的名字时，我不由地就向他俩投去了“不怀好意”的目光。现在每每听到动画中思文大喊：“欧阳，我来娶你了！”心中都别有一番滋味。\n当然，以上例举的原型“参考”来源于身边，动画中也有类似梅姨这样的角色是从新闻媒体等报道中取材进行改编创作的。\n至于如何塑造好角色，我觉得有三个重点。\n第一就是观察。角色立住的基础是真实，如果我们想展现老人，你连他们生活中的行为习惯都不了解，那怎么才能还原好呢？所以，多多观察周遭不同人的生活状态并且印刻进脑海里，是塑造角色不可或缺的好方法。\n第二是抓准人物特点，扬长避短。其实影视作品留给角色和观众“相处”的时间很短，而且动画比影视剧还短。所以，要在这宝贵的时间里让观众记住角色就得抓重点去讲。这里说的扬长避短，不是说光塑造角色正面，而是把角色能让观众快速记住的特征尽可能展现出来，加强观众对他们的印象。\n最后一点，角色需要自驱力。有了真实，有了特点，最终能让角色鲜活起来的还是他们有一个存在于故事世界的目的，且这个目的能够自洽和持续推动角色往前走。这看似是创作中理所应当要考虑的一点，但往往最简单的事也是人们最容易忽略的。这也是为什么有很多时候，我们会看到角色在动画中的行动线飘忽不定，又或是故事进行到一半开始往另一个方向急转直下，往往把观众都看懵了。\n以上对角色塑造的看法也只是我个人比较片面的一些经验和解读，未来有机会还希望能够多跟大家交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nhaolin\n点击下载\n40 个回答，查看全部。\n动画《时光代理人》已经完结，如何评价这部作品？\n谁是动画史上最糟糕的角色？为什么？",

          "description": "《镜》系列是沧月老师的经典小说，也是不少人的童年回忆。这部作品不仅有宏大的背景结构，更有个性鲜明的角色和他们之间错综复杂的关系。因此我认为，如何用视听语言来复现书粉们梦中的云荒世界是本次动画化的重点，重中之重放在了角色的塑造上（下面会详细说明）。\n不同于其它的作品，云荒在地理设置上有相当的包容感，这就给了作品的美术很大的想象空间。充满神性的白塔和人来人往的桃源郡是完全不同的风格，因此在建筑和场景风格上本作可以做出相当华丽却又充满异域风情的视效，相信会给观众耳目一新的感觉。\n\n\n\n我想重点讲讲角色。\n在人物塑造方面，沧月老师的笔触是相当细腻的，这体现在每个角色都有自己丰满的个人故事和鲜明的性格特征，同时在小说中又并没有占据极大的篇幅就完成了群像式的角色塑造，这给我们动画制作带来了相当的挑战。为了塑造好人物，我们主要做了三方面的工作。\n其一是剧情的取舍，如何在固定的篇幅下取舍故事是一个很大的难点。因为小说的内容十分丰厚，在有限的时长里，如何保证核心剧情的串联，又同时尽量保持每个角色的高光时刻，花费了我们相当的功夫。\n第二个难点在于小说的叙事顺序是穿插的，天马行空的笔触结合宏大的故事让行文非常浪漫。但如果原原本本的按小说顺序照搬到周更的动画上，就容易抬高观看的门槛。我个人一直都认为动画最大的作用是做IP放大，让更多人了解和喜欢一个新故事；因此怎么做时间线和故事线的合并、让没看过《镜》系列的新观众也能轻松入坑是另一个攻略的重点。\n第三，为了辅助二，如何保持角色立体的性格特征又对各自所处的阵营有归属感是美术方面发力的重点。我们制作时一边参考了小说中对于角色的描绘，一边给予了每个阵营鲜明的核心美术特征。比如鲛人族的角色因为国家破灭，长期被奴役压迫，几个主要出场角色又身负重任，因此在色彩选取上偏深偏暗，不会整体给成太小清新的感觉；就算是统领复国军的如意夫人，她符合表面职业的参考花魁的装扮，也是在她深色的裙摆基础上来作为点缀的。\n\n——————————我是回答完毕的分割线——————————\n感谢看到这里的知友，希望《镜·双城》能得到大家的认可和喜欢！\n再次感谢大家的支持！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n孤高的护手霜\n点击下载\n10 个回答，查看全部。\n如何看待诡秘之主将要动画化?\n如何评价漫画《快把我哥带走》动画化？",

          "description": "个人觉得，有无原著关系很大！\n\n\n先说为什么人气会超《圣斗士》，再说为什么现在很少被提及！\n\n\n▼《魔神坛斗士》的人气\n在战斗武装这个类别，《魔神坛斗士》的人气在当时来说，的确超过了《圣斗士》。但仅限在日本国内。\n\n\n\n与《圣斗士》一样，《魔神坛斗士》也是美少年动画的一员。而与《圣斗士》的区别就在于一个有原著，一个没有。\n\n\n没有原著这意味着什么？\n\n\n这意味着不会受到原著的版权影响，在创作上的自由度就要高得多得多。\n\n\n《魔神坛斗士》作为原创动画，在各个方面能够自由展开，满足了当时粉丝的各种需求。所有的创作都是在满足需求的前提下进行，这也就加速了它人气的暴涨。\n\n\n与《圣斗士》最大的不同点还要说是对粉丝的各种福利\n\n\n不只是关联玩具的贩卖，与插画师等的福利合影，各声优的CD发表，以及与搞创作的粉丝一起合作的联合杂志等。各种与粉丝的互动也都是促成了人气高涨的原因。\n\n\n\n《魔神坛斗士》原本是面向小孩的作品，结果小孩没有太大反应，却受到了大部分年轻女性的追捧，很多腐女都是因为这部动画入坑。\n\n\n看看现在的很多女性，追捧流量明星是个什么疯狂状态，就可以看作是当时的状态\n\n\n面向人群虽然偏离了轨道，但是没有原著的束缚，所以可以随时按照当前需求进行创作，所以并没有翻车。\n\n\n最明显的就是在人物外貌上。毕竟是要符合年轻女性的喜好，所以人物的外貌从最初带有点稚嫩风，变得越来越帅气，型男。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n且主角五人的声优还结成了组合『NG5』，这一系列所带来的效益是很可观的。虽然面向小孩的玩具基本卖不出去，但也完全被其他方面给弥补上了。\n\n\n所以《魔神坛斗士》的人气，就是因为没有原著束缚，随时迎合粉丝需求的高自由度创作的结果。\n\n\n▼为什么现在很少被提及\n没有原著对于此作来说也是一把双刃剑。它在日本的人气，更大程度上可以说是迎合市场需求的造物。\n\n\n而《圣斗士》不同，作为战斗武装的鼻祖，最初的漫画原著就已经俘获了部分粉丝。而这部分人，就是纯碎的喜欢这个作品。\n\n\n《圣斗士》的对标人群也没有偏离轨道，喜欢此作的也是男孩居多。粉丝的粘性程度，就绝对大于《魔神坛斗士》的看脸女性粉。\n\n\n\n《魔神坛斗士》感觉就像是流量明星，人气爆得快，时代变了，也就无法持续下去了\n\n\n而引进到国内的时候，我们也早就已经接受了一波圣斗士的漫画，动画的洗礼。而且圣斗士的手办，也都在国内盛行，其所带来的影响是巨大的。\n\n\n不可否认，我们很大程度也在《圣斗士》的影子下去观看《魔神坛斗士》。因此，后者的影响力就不可能有这么大。\n\n\n即使在日本有如此人气，但是在国内，没有人来为他打造人气\n\n\n▼时尚因素\n其实在时尚方面，我个人认为也是一个很大的因素。《圣斗士》的圣衣设计，华丽但并没有太失真。\n\n\n\n而《魔神坛斗士》不一样，它凸显的是日本武士文化，在造型上就太特殊了。比起圣衣，外观更像机器人。\n\n\n\n包括之后的《天空战记》也一样，装备较为夸张。且当时盛行四驱车，天空战记备被加入了四驱车元素，可以把装备当交通工具。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n而三者一对比，就能很值观的看出，圣斗士有华丽，但最接地气。而且设计得也最漂亮，这应该也是导致其印象最深的因素之一。\n\n\n\n圣斗士不只是人物本身是美少男，穿上圣衣后仍然能保持苗条的曲线，而另两部则就要逊色不是一点了。\n\n\n不过总的来说，这铠甲三兄弟，对国内的影响都还是蛮大的，而且它们都有一个共同点：\n\n\n三部作品的歌曲都很nice，至今也如此\n\n\n象征性的缅怀一段\n天龙八部的感觉\n\n千翻儿娃\n点击下载\n74 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么圣斗士星矢能成为经典？\n19岁了，还有当圣斗士的希望吗？",

          "description": "两不疑第一季完结在即，也借此机会对项目做个简单的总结梳理，在动画创作、制作上跟大家一起交流下。\n两不疑动画项目从最早的PV开发也就是最早放出的一分半完整版pv短片，到正剧制作流程开发，正剧制作，上线，每周一集供应，周更一直到第一季完结。前后近两年时间，每个阶段都面临不同的困难和问题，而这两年也是纸飞机动画作为传统3D动画团队从开始接触三渲二到研发自己的三渲二视效建立三渲二制作流程的过程。\n回想两年前第一次跟IP方漫漫漫画一起探讨两不疑的动画改编时，第一个面对的问题就是两不疑动画的视效风格是选择3D还是三渲二。\n传统3D视效风格纸飞机本身制作流程成熟，在制作和预算控制上更有把握，而三渲二更适合还原漫画画风，可以给观众带来更贴合原著的体验感，但面临在预算有限的情况下还要从头摸索制作方案和视效风格的问题。\n当时双方一拍即合，三渲二！不论是画风、故事、角色塑造以优先还原原著为第一位。\n\n两不疑如果要做动画就要给漫画粉丝呈现一个她们期待中的两不疑动画。预算不足的问题通过延长PV开发周期来解决，给制作组一个较长时间来研究和适应新风格，利用其他项目的间歇来解决三渲二技术开发并完成PV制作。\n最终1分30秒的PV用了9个月的时间制作完成，通过PV开发制作组熟悉了三渲二的制作方案也对两不疑的画风建立了了解。\n\n徐钰美术设定\n\n徐钰角色资产lookdev\n\n国师面部阴影开发\n随着pv上线，两不疑正剧的前期工作也正式展开，在我个人的经验中长篇动画的创作生产与短片、CG有着本质的区别。一部能达到及格线的长篇动画首先考验的是各个核心主创环节的专业性和配合度，确立分工配合！\n由B站的监制老师把控整体方向，IP方漫漫漫画负责整体项目制片，两不疑漫画编辑以及原作者负责剧本原著方向把控，避免人物ooc，提供剧本修改的解决方案，纸飞机负责导演和执行制片及全片制作。\n呼，松了口气，终于不用担心我一个直男导演一不小心把两不疑改成少年热血番了。\n\nOk!原著漫画有好的故事基础，人物塑造到位，又有原作者帮忙把控原著方向，不用担心跑偏。那剩下的就是导演技术型工作了。\n如何将原著较为片段化的桥段和情节串联起来，如何把原著的故事讲的更有趣更有悬念，如何让观众更好的代入故事和了解认同角色，是否有原著中被省略或可以扩展的情节能提出来做点小原创发挥玩一下，可以说整个改编的工作更像是导演基础技巧训练。\n正剧前期工作推进的同时，针对两不疑剧集的三渲二流程也同步在研发中。与PV短片的制作流程不同，在短片中更关注如何实现三渲二的最终画面效果，角色、场景资产的制作会根据镜头的需要来规划和实现效果。到了剧集首先要解决大规模生产协作和制作成本优化问题，所有制作方案和效果必须建立统一的制作规则和尽量实现全流程的工具化操作。\n\n\n\n由于整个项目本身预算不高，为了在有限的预算和档期内尽量达到最佳效果，两不疑项目的整个制作过程中一直在镜头设计、制作方案和最终效果上寻找平衡点。在镜头设计上减少非必要的与故事表达无关的运动镜头，尽量使用固定机位镜头来进行叙事，一些常规的镜头运动采取2D动画的后期运镜方式，把更多的设计精力和预算放在构图把控和镜头节奏剪辑上。\n\n在动画上，项目早期也测试过动作捕捉方案，动作捕捉对剧集动画有着生产速度更快，生产周期更好把控的优势。但写实的动画风格跟两不疑不搭，而两不疑里的文戏、情感戏占比较多，对动画表演的准确度和关键表演细腻程度要求很高，最终为了更好的呈现两不疑的风格还是选择了全片使用传统手key动画。\n\n超过240分钟手工动画带来的问题就是，需要寻找大量外包合作的动画团队和动画师一起协作参与制作。如何控制动画成本？如何让各个团队统一动画表演风格？如何应对参差不齐的动画质量和海量的动画反馈？\n解决的关键在layout！\n在3Dlayout 环节导演要确定所有创作和角色关键表演信息，避免在大规模制作生产环节进行创作和修改。为了做到这一点两不疑的3Dlayout全部由纸飞机内部的动画师和有多个项目配合经验的合作方完成，在这个阶段进行大量互动沟通和反馈来确定镜头构图及表演创作，同时也参考了传统2D动画的故事板和原画流程，用尽量少的关键帧来确定镜头构图和角色的表演。\n\n\n虽然关键帧较少，但每个关键帧从角色POSE到表演状态上都达到最终的动画表演级别，用少量关键帧卡准表演的关键节奏点。这样来避免在进入正式的动画的生产环节因设计不确定而产生的大量重复性修改及损耗，也便于控制整个动画中期的质量和统一风格。\n\n以上是两不疑项目中我个人感觉一定有代表性的经验和问题，简单的整理下分享给大家，也欢迎对两不疑和三渲二感兴趣的朋友一起多多交流。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n王丰彬\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价电视剧《两不疑》?\n如何评价漫画《两不疑》？",

          "description": "谢邀\n我从以下四个方面解答这个问题：\n\n1、香型的由来\n2、香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌\n3、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n4、香型如此多，我们怎么选？\n\n一、香型的由来：\n酒自诞生开始，就有香味的区别，不同地域、不同技艺，形成了各自的代表酒。但在1979年以前，中国白酒是不分香型，统称为蒸馏酒。\n香型正式区分，是1979年在大连召开的全国名优白酒协作会议及第三届全国评酒会上提出的，在第三届大会的时候分别从气味、成分、微生物、酿造工艺等方面综合评价：确认了5类香型：清香、浓香、酱香、米香、其他香型（不属于其他香型的统统归在这）。\n随后，经过进一步研究，扩展为12种香型：\n清香型、浓香型、酱香型、米香型、兼香型、药香型、凤香型、特香型、芝麻香型、老白干、馥郁香和豉香型。\n\n二、各个香型的工艺、特点及代表品牌。\n香型的名称应该反映出本香型产品的个性和内涵，但是香型的划分并不统一：\n有的按照香味的浓烈程度来判断：比如浓香型，判断标准是酒体中的窖香突出。\n有的根据香味所体现的口感特征来判断：比如酱香型，判断标准酱香、焦香、糊香的复合香气。\n还有以产品名称来划分：比如凤香型、老白干香型，特香型。\n为了统一标准，要求必须在每个香型后面加入其工艺、风味特征的描述，于是有了下图：\n\n三、形成十二种香型是偶然，也是必然的：\n为什么中国的白酒香型如此之多？\n总的来说分为以下原因：\n1、历史原因：\n中国多次民族分裂和民族融合，使我国成为多民族文化共存的国家，各民族的地理环境、风俗习惯，饮食习惯的差异，各地人口味千差万别，形成了“食有千种，味有千样”的华夏饮食体系，由此体系衍生出来的白酒，就变成多种香型共存的口感需求。\n2、技术发展：\n由于生产工艺的创新发展，酿造原料的多样性，各个区域形成了特色、风格不同的各种香型的白酒，加上地理环境的差异性，导致不同区域的酒曲、窖泥、酒醅和地域环境，都对微生物有不同的影响，从而影响到发酵的速度，香味，口感等。\n四、面对种类如此多的香型，我们应该怎么选择？\n（1）如果你之前没有喝过白酒，但是最近想开始试着接触白酒，那我建议你可以从清香、米香开始，这两个香型，口感比较淡，入口绵顺柔和，舒适度高，刺激性较弱，有利于给初次接触的人，留下一个好印象。\n我推荐汾酒和三花两个品牌的中端酒，这样能提升白酒的好感度、趣味性和持续性。\n比如这款老白汾15：\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/9ce8fdbdc0133fa79cfe34337ead254c?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n（2）如果你已经接触了一段时间白酒了，那我推荐你看看各知名品牌，在这我也推荐几款虽然名气比不上一线，但是酒质和性价比绝对划算的品牌，这几款酒一定可以让你惊艳。\n酱香：年份潭酒、金质、丹泉。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/c0015374386b79f17e3795fecfe84c87?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n浓香：丰谷、五粮春、泸特、金剑南\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/df5d7945012c7e7275e1e56ca47ef7b9?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：口子窖\n（3）如果你是老酒鬼，那就看看下面这些公认的性价比高的口粮酒吧。\n清香：汾酒、红星、牛栏山。\n浓香：双沟圣坊、文君、今世缘（单开、对开）、丰谷酒王10。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/8116e263867e34fc8715090921f95010?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n酱香：金质、金酱、武陵少酱、金沙回星。\nhttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/4d01d2a2702995759d67b86e17cc24bf?BIZ=ECOMMERCE\n兼香：白云边15年、口子窖6年。\n特香：东方弘韵。\n食有千种，味有千样，喝酒重要的不是香型，而是喝酒气氛、讲出来的故事、带动的情绪，饮酒之趣，在于不同时间、不同环境，喝酒体验大相径庭。\n如果你觉得文章让你进一步了解白酒的香型，请点个赞再走吧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知酒浓\n点击下载\n256 个回答，查看全部。\n有哪些 酱香型、浓香型、清香型、兼香型白酒适合做口粮的？\n酱香型、清香型、浓香型等白酒究竟有哪些区别？",

          "description": "首先丰收的是秋粮，那么\n全国秋粮作物主要包括哪些？\n朱娟（农业农村部种植业管理司农情信息处处长）：秋粮作物主要是玉米、中晚稻、还有大豆，另外还有一些春小麦和杂粮、杂豆，这里面的玉米大概占了52%左右，中晚稻占了37%，大豆占了4%，\n大家很关心一个问题，夏粮和早稻都丰收了，但是我们知道像河南等地遭遇了暴雨洪涝灾害的影响，那么这种灾情对全国的秋粮生产（影响）有多大？\n自然灾害对秋粮影响有多大\n朱娟：确实正如您所说，今年极端天气比较多，局部像河南灾情确实比较重，但是整个全国面上的灾情总体偏轻。这里有两组数据，我给大家介绍一下，一个是重灾区的面积占秋粮（总面积）的整体比例是比较小的，今年受灾比较重的主要是集中在两个区域，一个是河南受涝，另外一个就是西北受旱，那河南大家也知道，“7·20”极端暴雨洪涝灾害，造成河南农作物受灾是一千五百多万亩，其中秋粮是一千一百多万亩，占到河南秋粮面积的14%左右，但是从全国来看，它仅占全国秋粮面积的1%左右。\n所以这个大家一定要清楚，大家一想河南它是粮食生产大省，但其实从秋粮这个角度来看，它的占比在全国的占比并不高。\n朱娟：而且河南的秋粮，还有六千五百多万亩没有受灾的秋粮，这部分作物长势不错，可以做到以丰补歉。另一块区域就是西北的受旱区域，西北陕西、甘肃、宁夏今年旱情比较重，受旱面积最大的时候达到了一千九百多万亩，这个占到全国秋粮面积大概1.5%左右，但是这里面因为它西北杂粮、杂豆的占比比较高，所以它是属于这种低产作物，对整个全国秋粮产量的影响也是很有限的。\n那么除去这些受灾的地区，其他的整体上来看，没有受灾的地区秋粮长势怎么样？\n朱娟：在秋粮生长发育期内大部分地区，光、温、水匹配比较好，就没有发生这种流域性的、区域性的、大范围的旱涝灾害，从我们调度的情况，6月以来，就是秋粮的主要生长发育期内，是近十年同期受灾是最轻的一年，特别是东北地区，今年雨水多，旱情非常轻，也没有发生像去年秋收前这种连续三个台风的袭击，所以东北今年是个大丰收年。\n从敏芳那边的自己种植的情况来看，你们今年的水稻种植的过程当中，有没有遇到一些灾害性天气的影响？因为湖南也是水稻种植大省。\n董敏芳：其实我们在种植过程当中，今年的早稻倒是碰上了“倒春寒”，但是通过我们的科学化种植，科技兴农我们采用的旱地育秧，有效地保障了秧苗的品质，我们是有效地防范了“倒春寒”的影响，所以对于我们的产量来讲没有造成影响。\n今年秋粮丰收不容易\n朱娟：今年秋粮克服了局部极端的洪涝、干旱以及病虫害重发等等不利因素，再获丰收非常不容易，今年秋粮面积，在去年已经增加了八百七十多万亩的基础上，今年进一步增加达到12.9亿亩以上。这是奠定了丰收的基础。今年国家继续实施稻谷、小麦最低收购价政策，而且把最低收购价提高了一分钱，此外扩大了玉米、大豆生产者补贴的资金的规模，还首次安排一次性实际种粮农民补贴资金总额达到200亿元，直接支持粮食生产的扶持政策，资金规模也进一步扩大，我们统计了一下，是增加了六十多亿元。农业农村部在关键农时派出了二十多个专家组和工作组，赴主产省指导生产。\n在河南洪涝灾情发生后，中央财政安排专项资金，支持农业抗灾救灾。农业农村部第一时间组织专业力量指导抗灾救灾。调用两千多台抽水泵、组织5.8万农机手帮助重灾区抽排田间积水。派出22个专家小分队带物资、带技术，蹲点指导灾后改种补种。协调周边省份，捐赠救灾种子等农资，满足灾后改种补种的需要。绝收的五百多万亩秋粮，有一半进行了改种补种，挽回了部分损失。\n在秋粮收获时，黄淮海地区遭遇极端天气影响，特别是山西陕西等地洪涝灾情严重。农业农村部立即组织专家组，指导当地抢收抢种。黄淮海地区的秋粮作物主要是玉米，据农情调度，截至目前，山西秋粮收获进度2/3左右。陕西秋粮收获进度3/4以上。两省反映，“十一”强降雨发生的时候，两省秋粮产量已基本形成，灾害对产量影响是有限的。农业农村部宣布，今年秋粮增产已成定局，秋粮面积稳中有增，目前收获已近8成。近期的连阴雨对产量影响总体有限，全年粮食产量将再创历史新高，连续7年保持在1.3万亿斤以上。\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国三农发布\n点击下载\n109 个回答，查看全部。\n我们中国的粮食真的是年年增长吗？\n国家粮食储备库是干嘛的呢？",

          "description": "大家好，我是震雷的孙猛，此次《识夜描银》改编动画的导演。\n我是在2018年末开始思考《识夜描银》的动画改编工作的。我的第一件工作，就是作为系列构成，去寻找这个故事到底要讲什么。\n作为文学影视作品，不单单的讲流水线式的剧情，而是深度发掘其内在的精神内核，将其想表达的东西传达给观众，引起观众思考，反思，回味，是本次改编的重点意义所在。\n为此我与原作进行了很多交流，也得到了很多来自作者的创作资料，从而更好，更全面的了解了故事的全貌和内核。\n\n\n“这个世界所有的力量，源自于信仰。\n这句话可以说，是本作最核心的原则，心存善念，就会带来吉祥，心存恶念，就会招致毁灭。\n看似唯心主义的东西，其实是体现了非常传统的东方思想，原作者在《识夜描银世界规律》一文中写道，”规律孕育万物，从草木变成人，有了众生，众生对大自然有了敬畏，产生了信仰，信仰缔造了神明，赋予了神明神权“，这是非常传统的老子道家思想的演化，非常中国味，同时也充满了哲理。这也是本作最打动我的地方。原作漫画里这一点表现的比较隐晦，所以在动画的改编过程中，这一点将作为中心思想，贯穿始终。\n在这一点的基础上引申下去的话，也可以引出很多方面的反思，神明是人造的，人们又回过头去崇拜那个神明，将权利交付与他们，甘心受其统治，谁也没见过上天，但自我塑造出了天子，并将全部权利交付于他统治自己。不过太过深入的话，我觉得可能会跑偏到民主政治和独裁政治的讨论上去，那样的话也许会给本作招来不必要的麻烦，要不就算了吧（笑）。\n\n\n在世界观上，本作和一般的武侠，玄幻类作品相比，也有着一个非常重大区别，那就是对于所谓的“鬼”这个概念的阐述。在绝大部分的此类作品，在这一点上都没有能够突破传统，而本作在这一点上，有着非常有深刻意义的设定，那就是这世界上没有鬼，而人是有灵魂的，人的灵魂分成三份，天魂，地魂，人魂。人死之后，天魂归天，地魂入地，人魂消散，归于虚无。这一…",

          "description": "现在非法使用军服仿制品的行为不少。大街小巷，非军人穿着迷彩服的现象几乎每天都能看到，这是很不严肃的。尤其是工地上，非军人穿迷彩服的可能更多，尽管没有配上军衔和军种符号，但非常碍眼。到了冬天，迷彩军大衣又成为非军人比较喜欢穿的衣服。\n对于军服的日常管理，早在2009年，国务院就发布第547号令，出台《军服管理条例》，自2009年3月1日起施行，全文共20条。\n其中第九至十八条规定如下：\n第九条  现役军人以及依照法律、法规和军队有关规定可以穿着军服的人员，应当依照有关规定穿着军服。军队警备执勤人员应当加强检查、纠察，及时纠正违法穿着军服的行为。影视制作和文艺演出单位的演艺人员因扮演军人角色需要穿着军服的，应当遵守军队关于军服穿着的规定，不得损害军队和军人形象。非拍摄、演出时不得穿着军服。\n第十条  禁止买卖、出租或者擅自出借、赠送军服。禁止使用军服和中国人民解放军曾经装备的制式服装从事经营活动。禁止以“军需”、“军服”、“军品”等用语招揽顾客。\n第十一条  机关、团体、企业事业单位和其他组织的制式服装及其标志服饰，应当与军服有明显区别。禁止生产、销售、购买和使用仿照军服样式、颜色制作的足以使公众视为军服的仿制品。\n第十二条  违反本条例规定，有下列情形之一的，由工商行政管理部门没收违法物品和违法所得，处1万元以上10万元以下的罚款；违法经营数额巨大的，吊销营业执照；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任：（一）非法生产军服、军服专用材料的；（二）买卖军服、军服专用材料的；（三）生产、销售军服仿制品的。工商行政管理部门发现涉嫌非法生产、销售军服或者军服仿制品的行为时，可以查封、扣押涉嫌物品。\n第十三条  军服承制企业违反本条例规定，有下列情形之一的，由工商行政管理部门责令改正，处1万元以上5万元以下的罚款；拒不改正的，责令停业整顿：（一）转让军服、军服专用材料生产合同或者生产技术规范，或者委托其他企业生产军服、军服专用材料的；（二）销售或者以其他方式转让未经改制、染色等处理的军服、军服专用材料残次品的；（三）未将军服生产中剩余的军服专用材料妥善保管、移交的。具有前款规定情形之一的，军队军需主管部门应当将其从军服承制企业备选名录中除名，并不得再列入军服承制企业备选名录。\n第十四条 军服承制企业的工作人员泄露军服专用材料生产技术，或者军服承制、承运企业的工作人员泄露军服、军服专用材料生产、运输数量以及接收单位等涉及国家秘密的信息，构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n第十五条 违反本条例规定，使用军服和中国人民解放军曾经装备的制式服装从事经营活动，或者以“军需”、“军服”、“军品”等用语招揽顾客的，由工商行政管理部门责令改正，没收违法物品和违法所得，并处2000元以上2万元以下的罚款；拒不改正的，责令停业整顿。\n第十六条 穿着军服或者军服仿制品冒充军人招摇撞骗的，由公安机关依法给予治安管理处罚；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。\n第十七条 公务员和现役军人在军服管理工作中滥用职权、玩忽职守、徇私舞弊的，依法给予处分；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。现役军人出租或者擅自出借、赠送军服的，依照《中国人民解放军纪律条令》的规定给予处分。\n第十八条 对公安机关、工商行政管理部门查获的军服仿制品的认定存在争议的，由省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门鉴定。公安机关、工商行政管理部门依法没收的军服、军服专用材料，应当移交省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门；依法没收的军服仿制品，应当按照国家有关规定处理。\n由此可见，非军人着军服，是有严格限定的，影视演员在拍摄相关作品时，可以穿相应的军服，但非拍摄时，不能着军服。\n所以在守护戎装上，一是要加强《军服管理条例》的宣传普及，让人民群众知道军服到底能不能穿，非军人穿着军服会有什么后果。二是对军服承制企业，要加强督查和严格约束，除了向军队供货，不得将承制的军服或仿制军服向地方销售。三是对经营户，省军区（卫戍区、警备区）或者军分区（警备区）军需主管部门、公安机关、工商行政管理部门要加大执法力度，对售卖军服的经营户，及时处罚和制止。四是军人也要严格要求自己，穿旧的军服，要按规定处理，不要给家人或亲友穿。五是退役军人着军服，也要按照规定和时机执行，不能像在军营一样穿着军服。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n东部战区\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n军服上那些花花绿绿的块块是有什么特殊含义吗？\n怎么看美国陆军将换新军装，改回二战时期“粉绿”军服？",

          "description": "theme: smartblue\n今天中国谷歌开发者大会线上如期举行，其中主要包含了 Android 、TF、Play、AR、Flutter 等相关的内容，本篇主要介绍主会场的部分内容。\n本次大会看起来基本都是录播的感觉，我比较关心 Android 和 Flutter 的内容。\nAndroid\nAndroid 12 的发布主要在如下三方面进行了优化调整：用户界面、性能、隐私。\n\n关于用户界面谷歌提供了 Material You 的设计，可以说是  Material Design 的 V3 模式。\n从我个人看，这个对我们国内影响不大，毕竟大部分 App 都不遵循这个设计规范····\n\nAndroid 12 同时更注重多种设备屏幕的适配，比如 WPS 就兼容了折叠屏的工作模式。\n\n关于 MAD 相信大家也不陌生，Modern Android Development，谷歌开发者公众号今年就推送了一些列的 MAD Skills 的文章，其中就包含 Jetpack 常见的 Navigatoin、WorkManager、Room、DataStore、Macrobenchmark 等等的内容。\n\n还有针对 Andorid Wear 的介绍和合作品牌介绍。\n\nPlay\nGoogle Play 这次最主要是介绍了 Data safety section 相关，也是后续上架会慢慢开始强制性要求的内容。\n\n我在《对开发者而言《个人信息保护法》更新究竟是什么？如何应对适配？》就有对这部分内容进行过介绍。\n\nAR\n更方便的和更强大的 ARCore SDK，可以更便捷地调用，不出意外蹭了一波元宇宙的热度。\n\n\nTensorFlow\n举例国内外使用 TensorFlow 的例子：\n知衣 App 使用它让用户可以在线上使用衣服\n58同城使用它做车牌识别和车型等。\n\nWeb\n更加注重隐私权限的沙盒。\n\n介绍 WebAssembly 能更好接入 C++ 代码，让渲染更加流畅和优秀。\n\n\nPWA 可以更方便同步用户的操作，比如打开文件。\n\n\nFlutter\n官方介绍 Flutter 已经成为了最大的跨平台开发框架，谷歌 Play 上超过 350,000  App 使用 Flutter 。\n\n例如字节跳动就是最大的 Flutter 应用开发商之一，它名下就有 >70 款 app 使用了 Flutter 开发。\n\n腾讯不只在微信和企业微信手机端使用了 Flutter ，在 PC 端也开始使用 Flutter 支持，甚至在游戏领域。\n\n\n官方接收的反馈， Flutter 提高了 30% 的生产力，近期的版本主要在性能，可用性和插件方面进行了更新。\n\n\n对于 Flutter Web 而言，CanvasKit 渲染器已经支持稳定版发布了，接下来 Flutter 将逐步缩小 App 和 Web 之间的差异。\n\n\n比如 Web 的摄像头插件已经得到支持。\n\nPC 端依然还是 beta 阶段，不过可以在 stable 分支通过配置使用，目前还是处于继续优化的阶段。\n\nPC 端的改建主要是在 文本编辑、鼠标键盘、滚动和无障碍这四个方面进行改进，另外之前介绍过的 ubuntu 就默认开始支持 Flutter 了。\n\n\n\nFlutter 广告插件的发布。\n\n支持导入第三方包的 dart pad 现在可以 beta 试用，官方也推荐了一些状态管理的包，比如：provider、flutter_bolc、rivepod。\n\n\n\nFlutter 官方网站的改版，更多资源和例子的官网。\n官网现在还提供 Flutter 学徒的免费教程哦：flutter.dev\n\n\n总的来说这次大会主会场的内容不多，并且基本上看起来都是录制的画面，分会场也是开放了录制的视频，可以重播，有需要的可以直接查看：  https://developersummit.googlecnapps.cn",

          "description": "MarginNote的功能无疑是强大的，在新推出的 子脑图 功能和 标题链接 等功能的加持下，脑图可以无限层级的延伸、串联，打造个人知识库的能力已经初步显现。然而在实际体验下，我认为这种“串联”仍然是不完整的，仍然有不少“割裂感”，而且这种“割裂感”很多时候导致的后果是交互的不自然，让很多操作不那么自然、顺手，从而分散注意力，导致关注重点不在于内容、而是部分分散到了完成操作上，影响实际投入学习的效率。而这点实际上能带来的问题是很大的。知识管理、知识库打造实在是一个太大的话题，个人也仅是凭自己的经验所做的思考，在近期将琐碎的所思形诸笔墨。以下是个人一些不成熟的见解，在短短的文章里难以完全表述出来，还希望后续可以有更多和官方交流的机会。\n不得不说，MarginNote在软件的设计上，对于如何获取、学习、积累知识，甚至是主动创造知识上是有深刻的理解的，随着使用时间不断深入我越发佩服MarginNote的设计哲学之富有深意。这篇文章主要结合个人使用感受讨论学习、积累知识、打造知识库的方面MN可以优化的地方。\n个人使用MarginNote大致有两种场景（当然本人是人文学科的专业，也许与理科不同，纯属个人感受）：一种是零散的、不需要进行结构化的，另一种是知识型的、需要逐步构建一个知识体系的。两种场景的区分往往是和学习内容相关的。例如单纯的学习外语，那么把单词、释义、原文中出现这个单词的句子做成卡片，以便后续导入卡片组/Anki复习即可，不需要专门的整理脑图。例如单纯的阅读文学作品，通常没有或者不需要一个明确的框架，仅需要品读、批注、摘录即可，依托MarginNote的定位跳转功能，方便回溯到摘录的句子所在的原文语境，依托科学的算法也更容易记忆摘录语句。而和专业相关的理论、教程等等，具有一个清晰的框架，则适合深入研究、需要搭建知识框架和体系。当然这个区分只是相对的，当然是可以对外语词汇进…",
