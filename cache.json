Compare it with a chair, for example. A chair is an object, with properties. A chair has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of.

A abreviação será \"border\".\n \nA propriedade \"outline-color\" é muito parecida com a propriedade de borda, porém, o outline serve para marcar/contornar o elemento que está em foco na página caso o usuário queira passar pelos itens usando o teclado e não o mouse.\nAssim como a borda, o outline-color também precisa da definição da largura e do tipo do contorno para assim refletir a cor. A sua abreviação é \"outline\".\n \nNormalmente as cores de outline ficam ocultas no código e apenas são visíveis quando o elemento de fato estiver em foco na página, de acordo com a navegação do usuário.\n \nA propriedade \"outline-offset\" adiciona um espaço transparente entre o contorno e a borda do elemento.\n\nCódigo do botão:\nCodepen\nDocumentação CSS:\nMDN Web Docs\nw3schools",

On the other hand, a web-based app is hosted on the internet and can be accessed through the mobile device’s browser. \nLet’s look at the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches while taking into consideration the possibilities of doing both (native AND web-based) due to the advancement of web-based apps. \nNative App\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  PROS\n\n\nAccessing a phone’s available hardware features\nDistribution through …",

          "description": "The prospect of launching a website still feels incredibly exhilarating — even for those who have already launched numerous websites in the past.\nBut if you’re new to the game, you may have conducted some research and found that some web developers prefer to code websites in HTML, while others prefer to use something called a CMS (Content Management System).\nWhat is HTML?\nWithout HTML, we would have web pages that would look no less interesting than a page of unformatted text. HTML allows us to add style to text, insert and format images, embed video, customize fonts, add color, and a whole lot more.\nThe example below shows you the HTML coding for Core dna’s homepage:\n\nWhat is a Content Management System (CMS)?\nCommon CMS’ include Tumblr, WordPress, Joomla, Wix, and Drupal.\nOn the more advanced side of the spectrum, you’ll find ECM (Enterprise Content Management), which does everything a web CMS does, and then some. It supplements a typical web CMS features by facilitating collaboration in the workplace by integrating digital asset management, eCommerce, and document management into the mix. Going a step further, you’ll notice how most ECMs are becoming DXPs (Digital Experience Platforms), which help brands personalize content, deliver content to IoT devices, and much more.\nCMS vs HTML: What is the difference?\nYou see, with a CMS, you can often use pre-built templates to launch web pages more quickly. You can then customize those templates to make them your own. This is obviously a lot faster than coding something from scratch, and is especially useful if you have no coding knowledge.\nBut besides that, there are some significant differences between HTML-only websites and CMS-powered websites.\nFind out more at Core dna's blog on CMS vs HTML: Why Us a Content Management System?",

          "description": "Sometimes when you're running a Lighthouse performance check on your sites, you might come across the issue:\n<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute\n\nLuckily, this is a pretty easy thing to fix, whether you're using Next.js, or plain ol' HTML!\nIt's for accessibility! Screen readers often use a different sound library for each language they support. They can easily switch between those sound libraries, but only when a webpage specifies which language to use.\nTypically in your average Next.js website, the deployed page ships only a <html> wrapped site, with no language attribute attached.\nIf you were writing a plain HTML website (or using some other library that allows you to update the shipped HTML files), it would be a simple matter of adding a lang=\"en\" to your outputted HTML, like so:\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\nWith Next.js, it's a little bit more involved, but luckily not too difficult!\nInside of your pages/ directory (or wherever you put your page components), make a file called _document.js. This overrides the default document that is shipped with your Next.js site. Don't worry though, we won't break anything!\nInside of that file, add the following:\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang=\"en\"> {/* Add whichever language you want here */}\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n\nBoom, you're done! Make sure you don't delete the Html, Head, Main, and NextScript components, because they are required for your site to be properly rendered. Now, next time you run your performance and accessibility audits, your language settings should be in the clear!",

          "description": "I am 31 years old and I didn't knew this. Everytime I wanted to scrape some data table from a website I had to run a script to do it for me, when in fact it was so easy... like a walk in a park.\nLet's have a brief example of what I mean. So how do you go from this...\n\nto this...\n\n... in less than 10 seconds.\nAll you need is the page you want to get the data from, in my case it's this one, and the  Excel app opened (you can use Google drive as well).\nWe will use the IMPORTXML function which takes as parameters an url, an xpath_query and a locale. All we need is to pass the url and the xpath_query of the table.\nOur single line of code will look like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//tr\")\n\n\nSo basically we are telling the program to fetch any table row from the page and display it in our sheet. Easy, right?\nRemember that you can modify the xpath_query to fetch anything from the page.  For example, if I want to fetch the 22nd row of the table I change the function like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//table[1]/tbody/tr[24]\")\n\nIsn't it awesome? I bet it is. Hope you've learned something! :)",

We do run into the case of repeated numerals causing an issue III, but we can clear that by multiplying num by any number between 2 and 4 before comparing it to res, since the numerals jump in value by 5x.\nOnce we know how to properly identify a subtractive numeral, it's a simple matter to just iterate in reverse through given numeral to find and return the res.\nfunction romanToInt(s: string): number {\n  let res: number = 0;\n  const symbols = {\n    I: 1,\n    V: 5,\n    X: 10,\n    L: 50,\n    C: 100,\n    D: 500,\n    M: 1000,\n  };\n  s.split(\"\")\n    .reverse()\n    .forEach((char) => {\n      let val: number = parseInt(symbols[char]);\n      if (res > 4 * val) {\n        res -= val;\n      } else {\n        res += val;\n      }\n    });\n  return res;\n}\n\nThis solution uses a lookup table composed which can help in easier conversion and much simple compared to the above one.\nfunction intToRoman(num: number): string {\n  let res:string = \"\";\n  const value:number [] = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];\n  const numerals:string [] = [\"M\",\"CM\",\"D\",\"CD\",\"C\",\"XC\",\"L\",\"XL\",\"X\",\"IX\",\"V\",\"IV\",\"I\"]\n  for (let i = 0; num; i++)\n    while (num >= value[i]){\n        res += numerals[i];\n         num -= value[i];\n    }\n  return res;\n}\n\nHere I have tried to solve them in typescript using ts-problems repo.\n🔁 original post at 🔗 Dev Post",

Today, we're going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.\nOf course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we're going to worry about creating the actual spinner!\n\nFor this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).\nWe start with just a very simple structure in our html.\n<div class=\"spinner\">\n  <img src=\"./rainbow.png\" class=\"img\"/>\n</div>\n\nTip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.\nTo create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we'll create a keyframe animation called spin:\n @keyframes spin {\n   0% {\n     transform: rotate(0deg);\n   }\n   100% {\n     transform: rotate(360deg);\n   }\n }\n\nNow, let's style our actual spinner!\n\nWe created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:\n .spinner {\n   height: 100vh;\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n }\n\nNow, for the actual image:\n .img {\n   height: 150px;\n   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;\n }\n\nNow we have a working spinner!\nWant to see the full tutorial? Watch the YouTube video below or watch in on CodeCast to get access to all the code in the Player!\n\n\n\n\nFor more of my content, follow me on like Twitter & CodeCast! \nYou can also read my last blog here:\nCreate A Portfolio Website with only HTML & CSS\nAmy Oulton ・ Jan 13 ・ 4 min read\n#html\n        #css\n        #webdev\n        #codenewbie\n      \n.",

Previously, if a user was to initiate an action that would trigger a component to update – such as a search that fetches a ton of new data to display – the whole page would just kind of hang while all that loading stuff was happening. This, as you can imagine, feels kind of awkward to users, so as developers we were forced to find other ways around it – skeleton UIs to make loads feel faster, debouncing, setTimeouts, etc. \nIn React, all updates are rendered equally urgently – o…",

          "description": "最近，我想将家里的网络设备，都升级到千兆。\n但是一查，千兆网络已经有点过时了，正在让位给万兆网络。我做了一些研究，本文就来谈谈相关的各种事情。\n\n一、带宽进化的历史\n我还记得，大概20年前，第一次在家里上网，用的是 56K Modem。\n56K 表示这个设备每秒可以传送 56000 个二进制位（Bit），完整的单位是 56Kbps（bits per second）。网络的传送速率又称带宽（bandwidth），所以它的带宽就是 56K。\n\n我们知道，八个二进制位（bit）组成一个字节（byte），因此 56Kbps 的最高下载速度是每秒 7000 个字节（56000 / 8），即 6.84KB（7000 / 1024）。一张 100KB 的图片需要 14.6 秒才能下载完毕（100 / 6.84），真的很慢。\n后来有一阵，上海推出 ISDN 上网，带宽到了 144K。这个速率是 56K 的两倍多，其实也很慢，不是很吸引人。\n21世纪初，ADSL 出现了，带宽达到了 512K，相当于传统拨号上网的 9 倍，当时就把这叫做宽带上网。\n\nADSL 的带宽不断提升，很快就从 512K 翻了一倍，达到 1024K，也就是 1M。我印象中，ADSL 最高做到了下载速率 8Mbps。它通过电话铜线上网，有物理限制，再高就上不去了。\n2010年以后，光纤上网出现了，取代了 ADSL。光纤的速率可以做得很高，最早是 10Mbps，后来是100M（百兆）、1000M（千兆）、直到现在的 10000M（万兆）。因为 1000M 是 1G，所以万兆也写成 10G。\n\n从 ADSL 的 512K 到光纤的 10G，大概20年的时间，个人的上网带宽（即下载速度）增加了2万倍，平均每年1000倍，这实在是很惊人的增长速度。\n二、家庭的入户带宽\n现在办理有线上网，都是先去通信服务商申请光纤入户。\n\n\n申请…",

          "description": "单纯品牌力的话，BBA中如果非要挑出一个“落伍”的，那就是奥迪。\n道理很简单，芯片短缺期间BBA三家先后涨价并限制资源，BB终端受到的影响并不大，但奥迪没坚持多久就开始放价了。虽然平时我们都认为BBA依然是同一线豪华品牌，并且奥迪部分车型更具技术和性价比，但很明显消费市场用实际情况告诉大家：如果都按指导价销售的话，原本想买奥迪的都去奔驰宝马了。\n回归正题，2021年影响奔驰C销售情况的主要因素就两个：\n\n资源短缺，当时新款预计9月上市的时候，老款6-7月份在很多店就已经断货了，新款上市后货量一直供应不足，直至2021年底车源情况才有所缓解；\n新款内外观变化较大，因为视觉差异明显且新C被媒体取了个“小S”的称呼，时间搁置越久，老款越不好卖，所以必须压制新款的吸引力而优先出清老款；\n\n\n资源短缺这个困难各个车企都存在，但也在细节上各不相同。单拿BBA来说的话，奔驰的资源告急时间节点是晚于宝马和奥迪的，但进入资源短缺状态之后，奔驰格外缺车，不像宝马那样虽然不够卖但陆陆续续也能到一些车。\n所以如果在那个时间段去逛一逛，会发现展厅最空的是奔驰，其次是宝马，而奥迪销售可能还会告诉你芯片短缺没什么大不了的过段时间就有车到了。\n\n上个月，也就是2022年1月份的时候，一些奔驰4S店还有少量老款奔驰C的库存（车型代码801），普遍优惠幅度在45000，这个价格就是普通人不找关系不走野路子在4S店多谈谈就能拿到的价格，而新款奔驰C（车型代码802）的优惠幅度只有12000-15000，不仅如此，因为新款配置有所增加和改变，所以指导价也是上调了的。\n这就回到了回答前两段碰瓷奥迪的问题——对于很多人来说，奥迪不是不好，而是超出了他们认可的定价区间，而奔驰也是故意拉大新老款的优惠幅度，使两代同款车型的落地价差距几乎能达到C级和A4L的差距，这样一来，自然是老款更好卖一些，但整体销量必然受损，道理很简单：不是所有人在感觉新款超预算的时候还会乐意去买老款，没准就出门左转去宝马看3系了。\n春节前我的老同学突然想给自己老婆换台车，问我C级和3系怎么选，我说你爱咋选咋选这个不要问我，看中哪款车我帮你去找关系要价就好了。结果这家伙奔着C级去却差点就买了CLA，眼看形势都有点控制不住了我就以他还没看宝马为由拉走了，到了宝马也略有离谱，看了两眼3系就站在5系旁边挪不动步了，随后惦记了好几天，想买5系，嘴上说还是给老婆买，其实内心已经是自己想开了。\n不过最终他结合家人意见和自己的喜好选了奔驰E，了解车源和行情的时候遇到了跟之前看C级一样的情况：4S店有现车，但交车欲望并不强烈。\n春节前常规进店客户，几乎就是统一口径没现车，需要订单排产，大概率节后提车。只有遇到极为难缠且利润大的客户单子，才会考虑放现车，除此以外，就是我们这种靠关系渠道而来的，不情不愿地给匀一台现车出来，这就是奔驰在春节前资源刚刚缓解时期的销售现状，卖车真不着急，利润优先。\n\n综合来看，不仅限于奔驰，在2021年很多品牌在车源紧张时期突然就尝到了之前梦寐以求的甜头：翻倍的利润，翻好几倍的利润。\n价格涨了之后，稀少的车源依然无法满足打了折扣的市场需求，所以在2021年也是少见的厂商双方都在内心窃喜的一年，以前经销商想保利润，厂家要求上量，而彼时却没有了这一层烦恼。\n所以即使要评估BBA中谁落伍，也不应该拿2021年尤其下半年的数据来分析，你永远不知道到底哪一家表面数据难看私底下却乐开了花。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n张凝澈\n点击下载\n46 个回答，查看全部。\n宝马三系，奥迪A4，奔驰c级，女新手纠结选择求建议！？\n宝马3系2019款和奔驰c哪个好？",

          "description": "“帝都流血夜”在原著《紫川》中，是一段非常重要且深刻的剧情，杨明华蛰伏多年，终于在认为自己有把握的时候露出了自己的獠牙。编剧在改编这段的时候和我们讨论了很久，他们建议能把杨明华的整条阴谋计划拉满，因为反派能力越强，才能显示主角们扭转乾坤的不易。[正义总能打倒邪恶.jpg] \n但那样会对原著进行大幅度改编，于是我们进行了反复推演，如果我们自己是杨明华， 手握这样一把好牌，我们应该怎么打？是强行夺权逼宫，不顾世人看法？ 还是会给自己扯一面大旗，把自己包装成正义之师？ 再或者……娶了紫川宁，毕竟没有血缘关系。[滑稽.jpg]\n原著中曾经提到“杨明华实在是相貌堂堂——怎么看都象个正直可靠的长者！”但实则““卑鄙到——连把牙刷都不能交他保管！”，足以看出杨明华是一个道貌岸然的人，做事考虑的也会更周全，所以最终我们为他选择了“勤王”的招数：让明羽模仿紫川宁笔迹，再盖上她的私印→让紫川宁昭告天下紫川参星的“罪行”→杨明华带军队前来救驾→事成之后再找机会暗害掉无人保护的紫川宁→紫川家族再无后人，杨明华自然就能上位了。\n而对于最大对手哥应星， 杨明华的计划是：派帝林去领远东军，分散哥应星势力→强行让帝林带远东军队回帝都→军官大会上帝林杀掉哥应星→为平公愤，杨明华“大义灭亲”处决\"刽子手”帝林。 杨明华算计了很多人，但是唯独忽略了紫川参星，这才酿造了自己的悲剧。[事后烟.jpg]\n《紫川》是一部史诗题材作品，里面有很多战争权谋的戏份，为了还原这些，团队进行了很多细致的思考，希望能给到大家一部不一样的动画番剧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n无名\n点击下载\n3 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价国产动画《紫川》首创隐藏互动剧集？\n《佣兵天下》可不可以做成系列动漫，对此，大家有什么看法？",

          "description": "KDE 团队宣布了 KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS 版，已经可以下载和安装了。如果你打算从以前的版本升级，在这里我们给你提供了从 5.23 升级到 5.24 的简明步骤。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.24 是 Plasma 桌面的第 26 个版本，带来了显著的视觉改变和一些后端性能的提升。在这个版本中，你会看到全新的墙纸、Breeze 主题的视觉变化、指纹登录和一个全新的概览屏幕等等。\n\r\n你可以在我们的综述文章里阅读有关 KDE Plasma 5.24 功能的细节。\n\r\n如果你正在运行 KDE Plasma 的早期版本，你可以按本文说明升级到最新版本。\n\r\n如何升级到 KDE Plasma 5.24\n\r\n这个版本的升级包大小适中，在我的测试机器上大约是 450MB 以上。在开始升级过程之前，请确保关闭所有应用程序并保存你的数据。\n\r\n一般来说，KDE 的升级是非常稳定的，它从来不会失败。但是，如果你想格外谨慎，并且有宝贵的数据，你可能想对这些进行备份。但同样，在我看来，我相信这是没有必要的。\n\r\n步骤\n\r\n如果你是在 KDE Neon 之中、滚动发布的发行版（如 Arch Linux、Manjaro 之类）中运行 KDE Plasma 5.23，你可以打开 KDE 工具 “发现Discover”，点击检查更新。\n\r\n你可以通过“发现Discover”的升级包列表验证 Plasma 5.24 是否可用。\n\r\n一旦确认可用，点击“发现Discover”窗口右上方的“全部更新Update All”按钮。\n\r\n另外，你也可以从终端运行下面的命令，在 KDE Neon 中开始升级过程。\n\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo pkcon update\r\n\n\r\n升级过程完成后重启系统。\n\r\n而重启后，你应该看到全新的 KDE Plasma 5.24 出现在你面前。\n\r\n在 Fedora 35 和 Ubuntu 21.10 中升级 KDE Plasma 5.24\n\r\n截至目前，Fedora 35 和 Ubuntu 21.10 是两个主要的 KDE 的发行版。由于 更新政策，Fedora 35 不会得到这个版本，而 Fedora 36 也将很快发布。 \n\r\n然而，如果你仍然想做实验，你可以在 Ubuntu 21.10 和 Ubuntu 21.04 中使用下面的 Backports PPA 安装这个新版本的 Plasma 桌面。在这样做的时候，请确保你保留一份数据备份。\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\r\nsudo apt-get full-upgrade\r\n\n\r\n在 Fedora 35 中，我试图通过下面的 COPR 仓库来安装。但是有太多的依赖性冲突需要解决，在一个稳定的系统中尝试这样做是有风险的。我建议目前不要在 Fedora 35 中尝试下面的方法。当然你仍然可以通过 allowerasing 标志来安装。但不要这样做。\n\r\n另外，我猜 Fedora 35 的官方版本会在第一个小版本（即 5.24.1）发布时更新，该版本将于 2022 年 2 月 15 日发布，所以你可以等到那时。\n\r\n另外，等待 Fedora 36 也是比较明智的做法，因为它将这个版本作为默认版本。Fedora 36 将于 2022 年 4 月发布。\n\r\n\n\r\nsudo dnf copr enable marcdeop/plasma\r\nsudo dnf copr enable marcdeop/kf5\r\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\r\n\n\r\n升级后的反馈\n\r\n我在虚拟机中运行了升级过程，并安装了新的 KDE Plasma 5.23。升级过程很顺利，没有出现意外或错误。好吧，到目前为止，它对我来说从未失败过。\n\r\n升级时间完全取决于你的互联网连接和 KDE 服务器。一般来说，它应该在 30 分钟内完成。\n\r\n升级过程后的第一次重启很顺利，没有花费多少时间。\n\r\n从性能上讲，我觉得它比之前的版本更流畅，这要归功于几个错误的修复和底层的性能优化。\n\r\n所以，总的来说，如果你在使用 KDE Neon，你可以安全地升级。否则就等待 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 稳定版的软件包。\n\r\n享受全新的 KDE Plasma 吧！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2022/02/upgrade-kde-plasma-5-24/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "KDE Plasma 5.24 带来了更新的 Breeze 主题、新的概览效果、新的墙纸，以及进一步的改进。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n我们已经关注 KDE Plasma 5.24 有一段时间了。\n\r\n从发现 GNOME 风格的概览效果 到增加 指纹支持。如果你一直在关注我们的报道，你已经知道了 KDE Plasma 5.24 所带来的变化。\n\r\n现在，KDE Plasma 5.24 稳定版终于来了，让我重点介绍一下主要新增内容和改进。\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.24 的新变化\n\r\n\n\r\nKDE Plasma 5.24 是一个长期支持版本，它会不断得到更新，直到 Plasma 5 发布最终版本（并过渡到 Plasma 6）。\n\r\n在这个版本中，你不会看到大幅度的视觉变化，但你可以找到各种功能改进和细微的视觉完善。\n\r\n对 Breeze 主题的更新\n\r\n\n\r\nBreeze 主题得到了一些视觉上的调整，以提高与应用程序的 Breeze 风格的视觉一致性。\n\r\n除此之外，默认的 Breeze 配色方案被重新命名为 “Breeze Classic”，以将其与 “Breeze Light” 和 “Breeze Dark” 颜色主题分开。\n\r\n选择重点颜色的能力最初是在 KDE Plasma 5.23 中引入的，但现在你也可以为其选择一个自定义的颜色。\n\r\n对通知的改进\n\r\n\n\r\n为了从视觉上区分重要的通知，你会注意到它的边上有一个橙色的条纹，以帮助它们从不太紧急的消息中脱颖而出。\n\r\n此外，为了提高用户体验，如果通知是关于视频/图片的，通知会显示一个内容的缩略图，以给你一个视觉提示。\n\r\n概览效果\n\r\n\n\r\n在 KDE Plasma 5.24 中，你终于可以看到新的“概览Overview”效果了。请注意，这个功能还在测试阶段。\n\r\n它可以让你轻松地浏览多个桌面，而默认是禁用的。你必须前往“系统设置System settings→工作区行为Workspace Behavior→桌面效果Desktop Effects”，在“窗口管理Window Management”选项下启用它并测试它。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以按住 Windows/Super 键，然后按 W 键，查看所有活动窗口和虚拟桌面的概况。\n\r\n对“发现”的改进\n\r\n\n\r\nKDE 的软件中心，即“发现Discover”也得到了一些升级，包括防止用户删除重要软件包的能力。它还允许你在更新后自动重新启动。因此，你不必等待更新完成，然后再重新启动你的系统。\n\r\n\n\r\n除此之外，你现在可以打开本地下载的 Flatpak 软件包，并通过“发现”进行安装（软件库也应会自动添加）。\n\r\n锁屏/登录中的指纹识别支持\n\r\n在 Plasma 5.24 中，加入了指纹认证支持。你最多可以添加 10 个指纹，用它们来解锁屏幕或验证一个应用程序内的操作。\n\r\n其他改进\n\r\nPlasma 5.24 还有其他一些变化。你可以通过 变更日志 了解所有技术细节。\n\r\n一些亮点包括：\n\r\n\r\n对屏幕键盘的改进\n\r\n&ldquolasma Pass” 密码管理器采用了现代化的设计\n\r\n在没有电池的电脑上，“电池和亮度”现在变成了只有亮度控制。\n\r\n对 Krunner 的改进\n\r\n当你拖放小部件时，它们现在可以平滑地以动画方式移动到最终位置，而不是立即传送到那里。\n\r\n在“关于这个系统About this System”的页面上有一个新的按钮，可以让你快速访问信息中心。\n\r\n即使屏幕被关闭或拔掉电源，活动窗口也会留在各自的桌面屏幕上。\n\r\n\r\n截至目前，你可以使用 KDE Neon 尝试 KDE Plasma 5.24，它专注于提供最新、最棒的 KDE 软件包。但请注意，它可能不是其他流行的 Linux 发行版的完整桌面替代品。\n\r\n如果你想在你目前的发行版上使用最新的 KDE Plasma，你得等待它进入默认仓库。\n\r\n你对 KDE Plasma 5.24 有什么看法？你试过了吗？让我在下面的评论中知道你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/kde-plasma-5-24-lts-release/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这并不是微软所承诺的……但也不全是坏事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n2007 年 1 月 30 日，也就是 15 年前，一再延期的 Windows Vista 发布了。\n\r\n我们可以尽情地谈论 Vista 有多糟糕、人们有多讨厌它。它是有史以来最不受欢迎的版本之一，与 Windows ME 一样。但是，你今天运行的随便哪个现代 Windows，它都是 Vista 的后裔。\n\r\nVista 并没有微软像 2000 年承诺的那样，Windows “Whistler” 将合并 Windows 9x 和 Windows NT：这变成了 XP，每个人都记得 XP —— 基本上都是怀念。Windows Blackcomb 是 XP 的计划中的继任者。它从未面世。我们得到的是 Windows Longhorn。\n\r\nBlackcomb 将有一个新的编程模型、一个新的用户界面，以及一个新的数据库驱动的存储引擎，“WinFS”……但它被延期了，然后被删除，最后被取消。\n\r\n谈论 Vista 到底是什么更有意思。摆上货架的是技术上更保守的东西。\n\r\n它有用户访问控制（UAC）：那些恼人的弹出式信息不断要求获得你的许可。（这实际上是微软意识到大部分的 Windows 机器都是独立的，没有连接到域。）\n\r\n它有一个 3D 合成的用户界面，“Aero”，带有透明效果，尽管这确实使它变得有点慢。而当 Windows 7 推出时，人们很喜欢它 —— 所以微软将它从 Windows 8 中剥离了。（指的是外观，而不是合成过程；那仍然存在）。\n\r\n它有一个包含“小部件”的侧边栏，这在 Windows 11 中又出现了。\n\r\n尽管它在五年前就被干掉了，但 Vista 是 Windows 7 的基础。Vista 是 NT 的第 6 版；而 Windows 7 则是 Windows NT 6.1。\n\r\nWindows 7 是经过调整的 Vista，响应速度更快。Windows 8 则是 Vista 2：是 Vista 的平板电脑版（它实际上相当不错）。\n\r\n困难在于，人们已经习惯了台式机和鼠标，所以开始按钮又被迅速恢复了。Windows 8.1 则是 Vista 2.1。\n\r\nWindows 10 是 Vista 3，Metro 现代应用程序被搁置，桌面应用程序再次成为中心。现在，Windows 11 删除了所有那些讨厌的、复杂的、混乱的东西，如垂直侧边栏。\n\r\nVista 是微软放弃其花哨的技术野心而开始简化事物的时候。现在有远见的人已经离开了。Surface 并没有彻底改变这个行业，它只是疏远了 OEM 厂商。\n\r\n15 年过去了，微软仍在对 Vista 进行迭代。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/01/happy_birthday_windows_vista/ \n\r\n作者：Liam Proven in Prague 选题：wxy 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Zorin OS 16 教育版的重点是离线学习和新的教育应用程序，为学校和学生提供帮助。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nZorin OS 16 是 2021 年最令人印象深刻的发行版之一。你或许想先了解一下 Zorin OS 16 和 Zorin OS 16 精简版 的信息。\n\r\n现在，经过一段时间，Zorin OS 团队终于决定发布 Zorin OS 16 教育版。\n\r\n可以预期包含 Zorin OS 16 的所有改进，以及为教育而量身定做的具体修改。\n\r\n请注意，教育版的 Zorin OS 16 是完全免费下载的。对于旧电脑，你还可以使用精简教育版。\n\r\nZorin OS 16 教育版有什么新内容？\n\r\nZorin OS 16 教育版的重点是以离线为先的学习体验。换句话说，它包括一个合格的教育内容集，不需要上网就可以访问。\n\r\n为了实现这一目标，Zorin OS 16 包括了 Kolibri，这是一个自由开源的教育解决方案，支持自定进度的学习，并通过本地 Wi-Fi 网络进行同步/共享。\n\r\n因此，即使没有互联网，你也可以依靠点对点的连接来分享教育内容，进行协作，并继续学习，不受任何干扰。\n\r\n学校管理者还可以创建自己的课程，并从可汗学院、Open Stax、麻省理工学院等来源下载现成的资源。\n\r\n当然，管理员需要互联网接入才能做到这一点。但是，一旦你下载了内容，就可以在没有互联网接入的情况下轻松地在本地网络上分享，从而使分发教育内容成为可能。\n\r\n除了 Kolibri 之外，Zorin OS 16 还出炉了新的教育应用程序，其中一些是：\n\r\nMinder：将想法和笔记可视化\n\r\n\n\r\n与 Obsidian 和 Logseq 类似，Minder 是一个更简单有效的思维导图工具，帮助你将笔记和想法可视化，而进行头脑风暴会议。\n\r\nFoliate：电子书阅读器\n\r\n\n\r\nFoliate 是一个令人印象深刻的 Linux 电子书阅读器应用。它应该能让学生/教师提高阅读体验，也能在需要时提供公共领域书籍的下载。\n\r\nOpenBoard：交互式白板\n\r\n\n\r\n我最近报道了 OpenBoard，作为我们的应用亮点之一。它是一个自由开源的白板，应该会让老师和学生也感到有趣。\n\r\nOpenBoard 应该有助于通过工具以及应用程序与多媒体内容互动的能力来改善学习过程。\n\r\nMinuet：音乐教学\n\r\nMinuet 专注于帮助你向学生教授音乐。你会发现视觉队列，以及和弦、音阶等方面的练耳练习。\n\r\n其他改进措施\n\r\n根据你的系统配置，可以选择 Zorin OS 16 教育版或 Zorin OS 16 精简教育版。\n\r\n这两个教育版应该会带来更快、更漂亮的桌面体验，可以访问更多的应用程序。\n\r\nZorin OS 16 教育版支持到 2025 年 4 月。\n\r\n你可以从其官方网站下载 Zorin OS 16 教育版及其精简版。\n\r\n\r\nZorin OS 16 教育版\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/zorin-os-16-education-release/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "AI 参加编程竞赛，成绩超过了一半的程序员\n\r\nDeepMind 刚刚宣布了其最新打造的 AlphaCode 编程 AI。它参加了 Codeforces 的编程挑战，这是一个极具挑战性的编程平台，通过类似于国际象棋的 Elo 评级系统来分享每周问题和相关排名。最终 AlphaCode 针对 Codeforces 网站上 5000 名用户解决的十个挑战项目开展了测试，且拿下了平均名次位于前 54.3% 的成绩。DeepMind 估计该系统的 Codeforces Elo 为 1238，位居过去 6 个月在该网站上发起挑战的用户榜单的前 28% 。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来至少有一半的程序员可以考虑改行了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n树莓派操作系统发布 64 位版本\n\r\n虽然 2016 年发布的树莓派 3 及后来的产品已经带有 64 位 CPU，甚至树莓派 Zero 2 也具有 64 位功能，但官方提供的树莓派操作系统一直是 32 位的。不过，64 位的操作系统可以支持更多内存，较新的指令集也有性能优势，此外，一些基于 Arm 的商业/二进制分发软件只支持 AArch64，因此树莓派基金会决定提供 64 位的树莓派操作系统。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：终于升级到 64 位了，虽然之前可以使用其他的 64 位操作系统。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nOracle Linux 出现在 Windows 商店\n\r\nOracle Linux 8.5 是 CentOS 8.5 的衍生发行版，以 WSL 的形式出现在 Windows 商店，这是红帽家族的发行版 首次 出现在 Windows 商店，尽管 Oracle Linux 不是红帽的。在 Windows 商店中，如果你搜索 Linux，你会发现 Ubuntu、SUSE/openSUSE、Debian、Kali、Alpine 等等，这都是为 WSL 开发的。但你不会看到 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL 之类的红帽系的 Linux，虽然有人为 WSL 中制作了 Fedora remix。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我就说 Oracle Linux 是叛徒，对吧。",
