          "description": "Time estimation in software engineering seems to be the most difficult task.\nTime estimation becomes a bit easier for well-managed projects where most of the design decisions have been made and there is enough internal tooling and resources. But it is still not perfect. Things become more difficult for teams with limited resources and external pressure on deadlines. More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.\nWhen it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge. It becomes worse if there is no external motivation or revenue potential for the project. Building something for fun or learning might end up in an unfinished project that never sees a launch day.\nSide projects should be straightforward by design…",

          "description": "what should I know before learning Java\n\n\nWell, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)\n\nI am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. \nIf you are a beginner, please don't use any kind of IDE.\n IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. \nIt is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. \nAs using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. \nSo you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. \nThis learning method is slow but very effective. \nAlthough you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. \nYou can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.💯",

It also highlights the line with different colors to help you better visualize and differentiate between errors, warnings and other messages!\n\nWith this extension, you can search for relevant CSS files by using CSS classes in html file and edit CSS files there itself! Here's how it works:\n\nGitLens is a powerful extension which can display when a particular line was committed, by whom it was committed and in which pull request it was included along with the commit message! All of this information is inline with the line upon which your cursor is currently located.\nYou can also hover over the message to get even more information about a particular line of code!\n\n\nThere are many more features in GitLens which you can explore and play around with!\nImport Cost allows us to see the size of the imported package inline in the editor itself!\n\nVersion Lens fetches information about dependency versions and displays it on top of the package!\n\nThese were the 5 VSCode extensions which are powerful, useful and can improve your productivity and workflow!\nSigning off.\nTwitter | GitHub | LinkedIn",

          "description": "在新安装 Fedora后，安装多媒体编码器来播放音频和视频是第一件要事。\n\r\n\r\n在这篇简单的教程中，我们将看到如何在 Fedora 36 工作站中从 RPM Fusion 软件包存储库安装多媒体编码器。\n\r\n介绍\n\r\n很多多媒体编码器要么是闭源的，要么是非自由的，因此出于法律的原因，它们没有包含在 Fedora Linux 的默认存储库中。\n\r\n幸运的是，一些第三方存储库提供了受限的和非自由的多媒体编码器、软件包和库。一个流行的社区驱动的第三方存储库是 RPM Fusion。\n\r\n如果你想在你的 Fedora 桌面环境中播放大多数的音频或视频格式的文件，你应该从 RPM Fusion 中安装必要的多媒体编码器，如下所述。\n\r\n在 Fedora Linux 中安装多媒体编码器\n\r\n确保你已经在你的 Fedora 机器中安装了 RPM Fusion 存储库。如果你尚未添加它，参考下面的链接来在 Fedora 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库：\n\r\n\r\n如何在 Fedora、RHEL 中启用 RPM Fusion 存储库\n\r\n\r\n在启用 RPM Fusion 存储库后，在你的 Fedora 系统中依次运行下面的命令来安装多媒体编码器：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-\\*,good-\\*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude=gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel\r\n\n\r\n如果上面的命令不工作，尝试下面的命令：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-*,good-*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude=gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel\r\n\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install lame* --exclude=lame-devel\r\n\n\r\n$ sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia\r\n\n\r\n这三个命令安装了非常多的东西，可以在你的 Fedora 系统中播放所有的音频和视频格式的文件。\n\r\n安装多媒体播放器\n\r\n一些流行的媒体播放器，诸如 VLC、Celluloid、SMplayer 和 Plex-media-palyer 等等，将提供所有需要的编码器。你不需要将它们全部都安装，只要任意一两个就足够了。下面给出安装这些播放器的命令：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install vlc\r\n\n\r\nVLC 预装在很多 Linux 发行版中，它是一个标准的用于播放各种媒体类型文件的媒体播放器。\n\r\nSMplayer 是 Mplayer 的前端，它被认为是 VLC 的最佳替代品。\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install smplayer\r\n\n\r\n如果你想要更强大是多媒体体验，安装 Plex-media-player。\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install plex-media-player\r\n\n\r\n这将不仅为你提供 H264、H265、VP8 和 VP9 编码器（均带硬件支持），它也将启用一种更高效的编码器 AV1（又名 AV01）。你可以使用 AV1 Beta Launch Playlist 来测试你的浏览器是否支持这个编码器。\n\r\n它们中的一些播放器也可以作为 flatpak 格式的应用程序来使用。如果与传统的软件包管理器相比，你更喜欢 flatpak 格式的应用程序，你可以安装它们。现在大多数的 Linux 发行版都支持开箱即用的 flatpak 格式的应用程序\n\r\n为安装 VLC 的 flatpak 版本，运行：\n\r\n$ flatpak install vlc\r\n\n\r\n可选 - 安装 FFmpeg\n\r\nFFmpeg 是一个功能强大的多媒体框架，它可用于编码、解码、转码、混流、解混流、录制、音轨、过滤等，以及播放各种类型的媒体文件。你可以通过在你的系统上安装 FFmpeg 来获取相应的解码器。\n\r\n\r\n如何在 Linux 中安装 FFmpeg\n\r\n\r\n希望这有帮助。\n\r\n相关阅读：\n\r\n\r\n在 Fedora Silverblue 中的 Chromium 和 Firefox 上启用 H264\n\r\n如何在 OpenSUSE 中安装多媒体解码器\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://ostechnix.com/how-to-install-multimedia-codecs-in-fedora-linux/\n\r\n作者：sk 选题：lkxed 译者：robsean 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "5 月 17 日，谷歌推出了一项新计划，该计划向谷歌云用户策划并提供经过安全审查的开源包选项，以保护开源软件供应链。该公司在一篇 博文 中宣布了这项名为 “安心开源软件Assured Open Source Software” 的新服务。在博文中，谷歌云安全和隐私部门产品经理 Andy Chang 强调了保障开源软件的一些问题，并强调了谷歌对开源的承诺。\n\r\n“开发者社区、企业及政府对软件供应链风险的意识越来越强，”Chang 写道，并以去年的 log4j 重大漏洞为例。“谷歌仍是开源代码最大的维护者、贡献者和使用者之一，并深入参与了帮助开源软件生态系统更加安全的工作。”\n\r\n据谷歌称，“安心开源软件”服务将让云客户能够访问谷歌的大量软件审计知识。另据其称，所有通过该服务提供的开源软件包也在公司内部使用，该公司会定期检查和分析其漏洞。\n\r\n谷歌目前正在审核的 550 个重要开源库的清单可以在 GitHub 上找到。虽然这些库都可以独立于谷歌下载，但该计划将呈现通过谷歌云提供的审核版本，防止开发者破坏广泛使用的开放源码库。这项服务现在处于预先体验阶段，将在 2022 年第三季度准备好进行更广泛的消费者测试。\n\r\n谷歌的声明只是广大行业努力加强开源软件供应链的安全的一部分，这份努力得到了拜登政府的支持。今年 1 月，美国国土安全部和美国网络安全与基础设施安全局的代表与美国一些主要 IT 公司的高管会面，研究 log4j 漏洞之后的开源软件安全问题。此后，有关公司在最近的一次峰会上承诺提供超过 3000 万美元的资金，以改善开源软件的安全问题。\n\r\n除了现金，谷歌还在投入工程时间来确保供应链的安全。该公司已宣布发展一个“开源维护小组Open Source Maintenance Crew”，该团队将与库维护人员合作以提高安全性。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/05/google-to-start-distributing-a-collection-of-open-source-software-libraries/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：beamrolling 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "以下是切换到 Linux sudo 命令的五个安全原因。下载 sudo 参考手册获取更多技巧。\n\r\n\r\n在传统的 Unix 和类 Unix 系统上，新系统中存在的第一个同时也是唯一的用户是 root。使用 root 账户登录并创建“普通”用户。在初始化之后，你应该以普通用户身份登录。\n\r\n以普通用户身份使用系统是一种自我施加的限制，可以防止愚蠢的错误。例如，作为普通用户，你不能删除定义网络接口的配置文件或意外覆盖用户和组列表。作为普通用户，你无权访问这些重要文件，所以你无法犯这些错误。作为系统的实际所有者，你始终可以通过 su 命令切换为超级用户（root）并做你想做的任何事情，但对于日常工作，你应该使用普通账户。\n\r\n几十年来，su 运行良好，但随后出现了 sudo 命令。\n\r\n对于日常使用超级用户的人来说，sudo 命令乍一看似乎是多余的。在某些方面，它感觉很像 su 命令。例如：\n\r\n$ su root\r\n<输入密码>\r\n# dnf install -y cowsay\r\n\n\r\nsudo 做同样的事情：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install -y cowsay\r\n<输入密码>\r\n\n\r\n它们的作用几乎完全相同。但是大多数发行版推荐使用 sudo 而不是 su，甚至大多数发行版已经完全取消了 root 账户（LCTT 译注：不是取消，而是默认禁止使用 root 用户进行登录、运行命令等操作。root 依然是 0 号用户，依然拥有大部分系统文件和在后台运行大多数服务）。让 Linux 变得愚蠢是一个阴谋吗？\n\r\n事实并非如此。sudo 使 Linux 更加灵活和可配置，并且没有损失功能，此外还有 几个显著的优点。\n\r\n为什么在 Linux 上 sudo 比 root 更好？\n\r\n以下是你应该使用 sudo 替换 su 的五个原因。\n\r\n1. root 是被攻击确认的对象\n…",

          "description": "小米想要禁止用户提取 apk 文件，但被谷歌拒绝了\n\r\n根据 AOSP（Android 开源项目）上的讨论，小米工程师提议给安卓添加 SELinux 策略以禁止提取 apk 文件，让用户只能通过官方商店或授权网站下载应用，小米的理由是 apk 文件可能含有来自私有来源的数据，比如其中的图像可能会被其他人拿来重复使用。但谷歌拒绝了这一提议。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：突然觉得谷歌还是挺有底线的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开发者调查显示对区块链、加密货币和 NFT 有强烈兴趣\n\r\n根据对两万多名编程人员的调查，SlashData 的 2022 年度开发者调查显示，34% 的开发者表示正在学习加密货币知识，16% 的人表示正在参与加密货币项目；32% 接受调查的开发者表示在了解 NFT 相关知识，11% 的人正参与 NFT 项目。此外 30% 的人正在学习加密货币之外的区块链应用，但仅有 12% 在从事这些区块链项目。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：SlashData\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：抛开各种金融困境不说，我是坚定地认为区块链及加密货币必然有其存在价值，是为未来所打造的基础技术。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n将云计算引入机器人操作系统\n\r\n由于重量和功率要求，机器人的机载计算能力往往受到限制，它们也很少有硬件加速器，如 GPU、TPUS 或 FPGA。但许多机器人算法和最近的进展都得益于高端计算机和硬件加速器。伯克利人工智能研究实验室正在开发开源机器人操作系统 FogROS。他们设想使用云计算来加速缓慢的计算，可以使机器人在相同的时间内做更多的事情。他们已经开放了 FogROS 2 预览版。FogROS 2 将 SLAM 延迟降低了 50%，将抓取规划时间从 14 秒减少到 1.2 秒，并将运动规划速度提高了 28 倍，与替代方案相比 FogROS 2 将网络使用率降低了 3.8 倍。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Techcrunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：云计算是大脑，而这些机器人就是它的手臂，可以预期将来的机器人会更强大，但是我总有对这种有强大智能的机器人一些恐惧。",
