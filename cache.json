For example, in a container that contains data about customer addresses, all items contain a state property. You can use state as the partition key for the container. Groups of items that have specific values for state form distinct logical partitions. When new items are added to a container, new logical partitions are automatically created by the system.\nThere is no limit to the number of logical partitions in your container. Each logical partition can store up to 20 GB of data. Good partition key choices have a …",

An example of caching that you may be familiar with is the browser cache, which stores frequently accessed website resources locally so that it does not have to retrieve them over the network each time they are needed. By maintaining a cache of objects on the user's hardware, retrieval of the cached data is almost instantaneous, leading to increased speed and user satisfaction.\nIn the context of server-side applications, caching aims to improve the application's response times by reusing previously retri…",

          "description": "Today...\nWatch the Event Capture, Propagation and Bubbling video from Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 program. If you want to code along with the video, you can use the contents of folder #25 from the repo you cloned above.\nI found this video to be very interesting because Event Propagation is definitely something I've never encountered before or wouldn't have know about firsthand. \nAs much as I liked Wes's explanation of Event Bubbling in the video, I was still unsure of what was happening. I went ahead and Googled for more information about it. I think the GeeksOnGeeks definition captures it really well:\n\"Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements\".\nEvent Bubbling triggers a selection of all associated elements, a rippling effect. However, not all events bubble.\nAn image from javascript.info was a good visual example of the effect.\n\nEvent Bubbling can be stopped using the stopPropagation() on the event.\n\nBUT DON'T STOP BUBBLING UNLESS NEEDED!\nNext, the video went over Event Capturing which is another phase of Event Propagation (\"Event propagation is a way to describe the “stack” of events that are fired in a web browser.*)\nUnlike Event Bubbling, Event Capturing starts from the top-down to the element. Event Propagation has three phases:\nCapture Phase\nTarget Phase\nBubbling Phase\n\nThe capture phase is rarely used and is implemented by setting the handler \"capture\" option to true.\n\nThe Odin Project\nhttps://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/event-bubbling-in-javascript/\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-simplified-explanation-of-event-propagation-in-javascript-f9de7961a06e/",

Its considered redundant as it adds no information and merely causes visual clutter.\nOvertime comments silently degrade. While code is continuously updated, the comments are forgotten. For a code cryptic in nature, readers turn to the comments to provide an explanation, and when that explanation is false it leaves the readers confused or worse mislead.\n\nThe asterisks in the regex pattern show that  it matches a whole lot more than it was stated by the comments which could be very misleading to the readers who do not bother to check the regex pattern.\nCommenting should be used as a last resort. Every comment serves as a failure to express yourself clearly in code.

          "description": "JavaScript has many quirks and difficult-to-understand behaviors. There are hilarious talks such as WTFJS and WAT that make fun of JavaScript for its strangeness.\nSince I work on refactorings, I have to consider many weird and sometimes funny sides of JavaScript. I will share some of the surprising behaviors that I encounter, so if you see them (which you hopefully never will), it might hint at what's going on.\nThis blog post explores an innocent-looking statement:\n// ... some code\n\nhelloWorld;\n\nYou might intuitively think that nothing should happen here - the statement seems to do nothing because there is no obvious function call here.\nHowever, it can do anything, for example, print \"Hello World!\" to the console.\n// ... some code\n\nhelloWorld;           // prints \"Hello World!\"\n\nHow can this even be possible?\nIt turns out that global variables (in this case, helloWorld) are properties of the global object. And properties in JavaScript do not have to be simple values. They can be implemented using getters and setters, which can execute code. Since the global object inherits from Object.prototype in modern JavaScript engines, adding properties to Object.prototype creates properties on the global object.\nHere, helloWorld is defined as such a getter:\nObject.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {\n  get() { console.log(\"Hello World!\"); },\n});\n\nhelloWorld;           // prints \"Hello World!\"\n\nThankfully this can only happen with global variables, and not with parameters or local variables.\nObject.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'helloWorld', {\n  get() { console.log(\"Hello World!\"); },\n});\n\nconst a = helloWorld; // getter is evaluated, prints \"Hello World!\"\na;                    // does nothing\n\nI learned about this strange behavior in a blog post about the globalThis polyfill. In the polyfill, a global property getter is used to access the global this object in different environments such as browsers, web workers, frames, Node.js, and ES modules.

In Python, the community has the saying of something being the “pythonic way”.\nYes, you should embrace “tradition” and make things simpler for everyone... except when you don’t.\nMany React developers out there will start a project and add Redux (or MobX, or Recoil... ) without even thinking if the project will even need it.\nAnd after they do that, since it’s already there it’s easy to just “go with the motion” and just make things in a way to use Redux.\nThere’s this story that you might have heard, it’s about someone trying to learn the family recipe of baking fish and that “you have to cut the tail to make it good” and then they would go from parent to grandparent to ask why you have to make the cut only to be told that it’s “how it’s always been done to make it good”, and finally the great grandparent will say that the oven was too small back in the day and they had to cut it to fit...\nAnd as history repeats itself, if you found anything I’m saying eerie familiar, then yes, more than 10 years ago Uncle Bob wrote that developers would start a project with a database because “you always needed a database right?”.\nRedux is just one of the latest... moment.js, Lodash, jQuery... remember then?\nRemember that the problem is not if you are or not using then, but WHY are you using it.\nCover Photo by Mohit Tomar on Unsplash",

If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.\nIf it’s still could not find the variable, it will either implicitly declare the variable in the global scope (if not in strict mode) or return an error.\nThe Scope Chain is used to resolve variables. When asked to resolve a variable, JavaScript always starts at the innermost level of the code nest and keeps jumping back to the parent scope until it finds the variable …",

The process was really annoying.\nTherefore, we decided to make a website that can allow people share link by simply visit our webpage.\nThis webpage will hold the shared link for 2 minutes, for now, and people can share the link via a share code so other people can access the shared text.\nSteps are very simple:\nShare your text on the website.\nUse the share code to get your text on other devices. If the text contains a URL, website will detect it and extract the link for you.\nWe used NextJS to implement both the frontend and backend API.\nWe opened a free Redislabs account so we can host our cache.\nWe used the free hosting service provide by Vercel.\nWe brought a domain name on Vercel for $70/yr.\nWe don't want to make a cloud storage.\nWe don't want to pay for a cloud storage.\nIn most use cases, this webpage just works like clipboard, so no long term storage is needed.\nWe don't want to pay for a cloud storage.\nPlease feel free to leave your comment!",

It helps programmers code more efficiently and makes engineering teams more productive. \nThe health of a company’s codebase plays a large role in employee satisfaction. Unfortunately, the pressure to quickly add new features imposes harsh deadlines on programmers. The trade-off is a decrease in code quality. This is the reality of the software development world.

          "description": "There are many ways to stand up a REST API. Nearly every programming language provides a way for us to develop a simple web server, such as Express.js, Go Gin or Python Flask. However, with the advent of serverless computing, we need to rethink some of the fundamentals of how APIs are developed and deployed. Chiefly:\nTraditionally APIs are packaged into one deliverable; serverless architecture encourages to divide solutions up into many smaller units that are packaged and deployed individually.\nTraditionally APIs are stateful applications that are started and stopped infrequently; serverless architecture encourages to start up compute tasks only on demand.\nIn this article, I will describe a way to develop a serverless API in TypeScript.

          "description": "在职场工作几乎都会有团队之间的文件共享需求。对于办公文档这种小体积的文件，既可以使用一些在线文档工具实现协作和共享，也可以只是通过 IM 类软件进行分享。但如果文档数量很大，一些在线工具就无法满足大量的归类检索的需要了，这时候使用文件服务器来进行存储就显得更为方便。\n而在实战中，大部分的企业也多使用通过权限管理的文件服务器来实现团队内的文件共享，一方面文件服务器的在局域网内，无论是读写拷贝等几乎没有延迟，适合团队内快速的分享和编辑。再者由于基于内网环境，具有很强的安全性。最后则是其使用起来非常简单，只需要创建 SMB 文件共享后采用网络驱动器映射，就可以直接在电脑上的文件资源管理器使用，大部分现代桌面操作系统都可以使用。\n\n但如果团队因为各种原因导致异地办公，同时也无法在搭建一个文件服务器的话，如何以更低的形式实现上述的这种团队文件共享服务呢？笔者也恰好在近期遇到了类似的需求痛点——考虑到行政人员需要经常性查找行政文档、而产品和设计团队还需要查找原先的工程文件，如何低成本的打造一个大容量的「云文件服务器」迫在眉睫。\n创建一个低成本的文件共享服务\n因为团队已经转为异地办公且不再租赁任何办公场地，因此原本通过文件服务器托管+ zerotier 来实现虚拟局域网组网的方案已行不通，所以我思路就转换成了先将服务器中大量的文件上传到基于公有云的网盘中，然后再想办法将其映射成网络驱动器。由于公司原本的文件服务器是 1TB 左右的空间，因此需要选择的网盘的大小大概在 1TB 以上，并且需要免费不限速的网盘服务，所以这里可选择的并不多，好在阿里云盘基本满足需要。\n将本地文件上传到共有云网盘服务中\n下面的操作就是简单粗暴的文件上传，因为是第一次开通阿里云盘账号，所以云盘空间只有几百 GB，对于动辄上 TB 的文件数据量显然捉襟见肘，所以这里我还通过在手机端阿里云盘 App 做任务来扩充云盘体…",

          "description": "付费订阅服务是一个时不时就会引起热议的话题。去年底，国内外就分别出现过两次付费订阅相关的讨论。\n国内，爱奇艺在 2021 年 12 月 15 日进行了全方面的提价，他们认为「视频平台的会员订阅价格一直偏低，这一现象已影响到了行业的健康发展」了；国外，网红笔记软件 Notability 从「买断制」转成订阅制，在引起广泛不满后道歉，并宣布老用户无需订阅亦可使用已购功能。\n在涉及订阅制和付费的讨论中，一种常见论述是「国外用户付费意愿高，服务定价也高；国内用户付费意愿低，服务定价也低」。这种说法在多大程度上是准确的呢？下面我们分别来讨论。\n国外用户付费意愿一定更高吗？\n在我看来，如今国内网友们付费的意愿并不低；虽然有些应用突然改成订阅很难受，但开发者要生存大家也能理解，对于质量好的也越发愿意付费支持。此类事件中，更让大家觉得懊恼的，是厂商并没有给付费用户提供更好的、符合预期的产品，例如应用对已解锁功能重复收费、视频平台展示所谓「会员专属广告」等。\n当然，准确的观察还是要通过数据来得出。\n2021 年，美国一家咨询公司 West Monroe 对 2500 名美国用户开展了调查，并于八月发布了一份题为《订阅服务开支现状》（The State of Subscription Services Spending）的报告。报告显示，2021 年美国消费者人均订阅服务开支为每月 273 美元，比疫情前 2018 年的 237 美元提高了 15%。这相当于每年多花了 430 美元，折合人民币近 3000 元。\n\n需要指出，West Monroe 报告中的「订阅服务」包括了网费、手机话费等，这些服务在美国的价格非常高昂，而且也不属于本文想讨论的「订阅服务」范畴。将这两项（合计 150 美元）除去后，剩下的实际平均开支应为每人每月 123 美元。\n那我们国内的情况怎么样呢？由于找不到比较系统的研…",

          "description": "作为独立开发者 + 业余吉他手，很早前就想开发一款练习歌曲的工具。因为在练习歌曲时，经常需要针对某一个片段播放上百上千次，有时候需要变调（演奏跟原调不一样）、变速等…… \n这些场景在使用 QQ 音乐之类的播放器时，就显得略为不便，找了一圈也没发现特别趁手的工具。得益于技术的进步，特别是音轨分离的技术（有兴趣可以参考 Splitter.ai）的成熟，感觉针对于「如何更高效地学习歌曲」这个课题，我们可以做出一些更 Cool 更好玩有用的东西。\n这就有了我们最近发布的一款音乐工具产品：AudioJam。\n功能介绍\n使用 AI 技术，AudioJam 能从任意的歌曲中，提取出人声、鼓、贝斯、钢琴或键盘、吉他以及其他的音轨，并可以调整音量 Remix。这个技术在扒谱或者跟歌练习的时候特别有用。\n为了表现它惊艳的分离效果，我制作了一个简单的视频：\n \n分离了音轨之后，在电脑端你甚至可以通过重新安排不同乐器的位置，重新混响音乐，模拟更真实的效果。\n\n设置并保存循环之后，就可以不断重复该循环，用于片段的练习。\n\n如果是常用软件，每个细节都是很重要的，因为如果不好用，那每次使用都会给自己添堵。所以在 AudioJam 中，与传统播放器只能通过拖动进度条来定位不同，你还可以拖动波形图，做到精准地控制播放的位置。AudioJam 还支持直接长按波形图由该位置开始慢速预览，这在扒取一些快速音符的时候很有用。\n通过降速功能则可以有效地降低学习难度，也可以通过升降调，找到最适合自己演奏的曲调。\n\n「音乐附件」是我自己很喜欢的一个功能，可以在音乐项目中。创建便签来记录扒谱的结果、需要注意的地方，也可以导入现有的曲谱，当前附件支持预览 Guitar Pro 的曲谱。将歌曲的学习项目化。\n\n我个人觉得对于歌曲学习来说，移动应用并非最好用的工具，在歌曲学习这件事情上，我还是比较喜欢桌面应用，可以更精准地控制跟快速地输入，因此 AudioJam 支持了 iOS、Android、macOS、Windows 4 个平台。\n\n自动扒谱？\n很多朋友，在试用了 AudioJam 之后都给我提出了一个想法，它能不能做到自动扒谱呢？这个课题我个人的看法是这样的：\n我个人不太认可自动扒谱这件事情，因为音乐学习，不应该以变成「人肉读谱机」为目标。而是通过视听扒谱，去理解鉴赏这个音乐作品，而这个过程是就是不断提升自己音乐审美观以及听力的过程，不应该通过技术来偷懒。\n现在互联网的信息发达，大部分的歌曲都能找到别人精心编排好的乐谱，自动扒取的还无法达到这样的水平。不过我也可能会在未来添加上这样的功能。因为扒谱这件事对新手而言太不友好了，如果能自动扒谱的话，作为一个「参考答案」来辅助学习扒谱的话，可以让学习扒谱这件事变得更简单，学习曲线更平缓，也是一个「高效学习」的好功能。\n所以我们也有在调研一些相关的技术，如果有朋友对相关的音视频技术有研究的话，也欢迎跟我们一起探讨。\n\n如果你也有在玩一些乐器，比如吉他、鼓、钢琴或键盘之类的。AudioJam 绝对是一款对音乐学习很有帮助的产品。希望你可以自己下载来体验试试。\n最后，学无止境，与君共勉。希望大家能一直保持，对吉他和对音乐的热爱。\n \n> 下载少数派 客户端 、关注 少数派公众号 ，发现更多实用 App 📱\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "人在北京，开过上百款车，自己分别有前驱SUV、后驱轿车和电动车，聊聊经验。\n东北有句老话：一猪二熊三老虎。不是真的说野猪的战斗力秒杀东北虎，而是人遇到野猪，往往不如遇到老虎那么害怕，结果被野猪挑死了。\n按照不同天气，对应的警惕程度应该是这样的顺序：\n雪天＜雨天＜雨夹雪＜冷雾\n雪天好说，地上都白了，是个智商正常的都知道该慢，提高预判警醒着开。雨天要比雪天更小心，因为车速高了之后，轮胎会与地面之间形成一层薄薄的水膜，导致附着力大幅下降，但很多人开车的时候有种操蛋的逻辑，感觉破水而行很爽，甚至故意加速压水坑，要是赶上单侧轮胎水坑里踩油门，那就离失控不远了。\n所以相比下雪，雨天更应该提高警惕。\n接下来是雨夹雪，这种情况就像过地雷阵，很难判断前方路面到底是水，还是冰层，还是冰水混合物。雨夹雪最可怕的是，不像雪天那样，司机会一直保持警惕。很多司机遇到雨夹雪，刚一开始心里还挺紧张，聚精会神，越开心里越放松。车速提升、预判变短，甚至回到常规驾驶习惯，以至于前方车辆减速时，自己的车刚好处于冰水混合的路面，只能眼看着爆前车菊。\n我曾经跑高速，真实的经历告诉我，最可怕的天气是冷雾，为什么呢？冷雾一般发生在深夜和凌晨，诱因大概是某个区域短时间内气温骤降，导致瞬间起了大雾。雾天开车各位都知道该怎么操作吧？打开前后雾灯，慢速行驶，非必要不开双闪。\n但突发性的冷雾，大家都把注意力放在视线上了，却漏掉了一个特别重大的危险隐患——路面凝水/结霜。这种情况比雨夹雪形成的暗冰更可怕，因为在深夜凌晨，路面是否凝水结霜几乎没法分辨，这时候一脚刹车下去，如果是结霜路面，车辆特别容易启动ABS和EBD，一些经验不足的司机就慌了，因为这种表现和他们的心理预期极不相符：\n不就是下雾了么，为什么刹不住车了？\n经验不够的司机这时候就特别容易慌，从而出现乱打方向等谜之操作，进而导致事故。\n最后附上我很久以前经历并总结的一次道路结冰导致七车连追事故：\n凯凯：【车库微观】东五环环铁桥七车连追事件\n\n\n凯凯\n点击下载\n5 个回答，查看全部。\n对于一直在南方开车的司机，下雪和结冰路面有什么技巧和不一样的地方？\n交通部门建议北京市民 8 日非必要不出行，降雪后路面结冰，该如何在保证安全的前提下合理安排出行？",

          "description": "我喜欢这句话，“我们无权评论别人的人生，同理别人也不可以。”\n肯定有许多人会过来阴阳怪气，“那可真是无权”（评论区果为如此，承认自己可能是特别难的一件事）。\n不患人之不己知，患其不能也。\n因为没有人能够比事主自己更了解自己，所以没法评价人生；对于同理，假装情绪去“可怜或者怜惜”我觉得想必都是虚伪的：不知他人苦，无法同理。\n在不违法的前提下，做任何事情都是自己的自由，网间相传的事情，狗头萝莉这样一位主播何尝不是类似于“陈冠希门”一般的受害者呢？\n关于早年的猥亵和强奸，既然已经在网上公开，不妨报警，众所周知，无论猥亵还是强奸如果要走法律程序，那么其重点就是证据。想要证明犯罪事实，至少要有以下核心证据中的几个形成证据体系：\n\n医院病历以及报告单（可能非常不容易取到，时间已经相隔太久）\n被告人的供述以及辩解（有大概率可以取得）\n受害人的陈述以及辨认笔录（确凿取得）\n案发现场勘验检查笔录以及照片（难以取得）\n能够证明双方是否发生性关系的精斑检验鉴定意见书（难以取得）\n能够证明被告人是否采取暴力、胁迫或其他手段以威吓受害人的证人证言（可能可以取得）\n能够证明受害人是否曾通过微信、短信和电话等方式向外传递求救信息的证人证言（刑事侦查可以恢复电子数文）\n能够证明受害人是否存在反抗、胁迫等迹象的案发现场（酒店入口、走廊）监控视频\n\n在以上证据的采集上，毋庸置疑，警方是十分专业的。然而由于本事件自发生到报警，时间间隔已经较长了，部分证据的取得可能难度颇大，不过在知乎依旧怀有热情的时代，我想会有无数愿意给予协助帮助的人。\n当然，关于刑事方面的建议我还是更为推荐去做专业咨询（我只能大体给一点点提示，这不是我擅长的领域，可以咨询两位女律师 @黄小牛 @王逸然 ）。\n关于高额违约金，涉及违约要付出的成本，让狗头萝莉背上高额违约金的原因是合同约定发生根本性违约时应当支付高额违约金——这件事情愿打愿挨，没有什么办法。\n虽然都说，违约金，性质上以补偿性为主，惩罚性为辅。\n但实际里面，无论是法院判决还是仲裁，其实都会基于会综合考虑实际损失、履行情况、过错程度、预期利益等因素，并根据公平和诚实信用原则进行认定。\n其中会重点考虑主播的知名程度、主播的主观过错、平台对主播培养和人气维系的情况、平台基于连续性合同履行所产生的预期利益损失。\n从合作之初，其实甲方设计来说，本就是律师通过精巧的合同设计来约束主播，而主播的行为被装进款式多样的违约套餐中。\n稍有不慎，就会触发高额索赔。\n纵然知道违约金很高，然而主播还是得签：无他，双方地位本来初始就不平等。\n当然，对于类似虎牙平台的资源倾斜来说（一个主播很多时候都是资源堆出来的），确实也具有设置高额违约金的必要性。\n以主播韦朕8522万天价违约金案为例，裁判机构一般会认为直播作为新兴产业具有较强的行业特点，直播平台对主播依赖性较强且行业间竞争激烈，平台经营者需要投入大量人力物力进行主播的推广和人气维系，顶级主播的直播间观看人数和粉丝数量对平台利益具有重大隐形关联。\n当然我想最开始签约的时候，狗头萝莉甚至不能完全理解合约对于自身的限制程度（比如私德条款之类纵然明星都不了解，何况一个游戏主播）。\n可是她既然在网络上说了她的过往，我想从法律上也许不是她不懂，而是已经失去了心气，这个时候的她，依旧还希望有人会倾泻予她以阳光。\n想起有个KWM的姑娘很善良，前天转过来她直播时候的视频，并评论“唏嘘于人生的不同，但是可以从泫然欲泪里感受不甘，以及无法脱身”。\n面包和牛奶都会有的，要振作起来，自己可以拯救自己，做一个你曾经想要成为的，能给大家带来更多美好的人吧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nLegal诗睿\n点击下载\n684 个回答，查看全部。\n游戏直播时声音好听的女主播的萝莉音是伪音吗？\n如何看待黑粉黑蔡萝莉？",

          "description": "《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。\n我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。\n音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。\n\n\n关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n妖刀王\n点击下载\n55 个回答，查看全部。\nCOMIC LO杂志前一百期有哪些经典内容？\n如何制作一张好的学术海报（poster）？",

          "description": "三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。\n\nWTCR是什么\n讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。\n\n拿到WTCR冠军有多难？\n既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。\n\n摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。\n\n有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。\n\n这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.\n\n在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。\n\n拿到这个冠军有什么意义？\n一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。\n\n在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。\n\n中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。\n\n对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。\n\n对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。\n\n而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n鲁超\n点击下载\n9 个回答，查看全部。\n领克02hatchback和领克032.0冠军版怎么选？\n领克03冠军版与03+驭风版你会选择那个？",

          "description": "看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧\n先上个答案：会也不会\n我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是17岁的时候拿的驾照买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车了，总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，应该是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的也有足够经验能说明问题\n我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。\n赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。\n公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。\n加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…\n至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…\n总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nCoalescence\n点击下载\n35 个回答，查看全部。\n赛车手需要学习漂移吗？\n如果中国有一条不限速的直道公路，你愿意来飙车车吗？",

          "description": "这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：\n1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。\n”盐者，百肴之将“[1]，意思就是盐为\"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。\n同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。\n\n比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。\n比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。\n比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。\n\n\n另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。\n2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性\n人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。\n可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。\n糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。\n3. 盐的可获得性高于糖\n盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。\n大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。\n而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。\n\n综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。\n如果你感兴趣其他关于味觉感官和厨房原理的回答，这里还有一些我回答过其他有意思的问题：\n为什么捏住鼻子就不会尝到味道？\n你是明白了哪几个基本原理之后而厨艺大增的？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n卫小妖GOGOGO\n点击下载\n32 个回答，查看全部。\n有没有替代味精的天然调味品？\n有哪些值得推荐的调味品？",

          "description": "这个题目分为两个方面：\n一.为什么自吸发动机的扭矩特性 乍一看好像很差；\n二.丰田和马自达的自吸发动机好在哪里。\n1.发动机的扭矩特性代表了什么？\n1.1 最大扭矩转速是如何测量（达到）的\n将发动机装在试验台架上，曲轴连接电力测功机。试验人员给发动机输入“节气门全开”指令（也就是地板油），然后同步提高电力测功机的负载。每当发动机输出扭矩与负载阻力矩平衡时（即转速稳定，不升不降），此时读取曲轴扭矩参数，并记录下来，比如发动机转速稳定在1800转、曲轴扭矩250牛米；然后继续增加负载，把发动机转速憋到1700转，稳定后记录1700转时的扭矩。试验人员不断重复上述试验，测出发动机在【节气门全开工况】下、在不同转速下的扭矩，然后在X轴为转速、Y轴为扭矩的坐标图上把点连成线，就得到了发动机外特性曲线，即发动机在不同转速下所能达到的最大扭矩。在这个曲线上必然有最高值，这个值（或一段值）对应的转速就是 最大扭矩转速。\n最大扭矩转速：250N.m@1250-4000rpm。这个参数的意义是：当发动机在【节气门全开工况】（地板油）下时，可以在1250转到4000转范围内达到250Nm的扭矩； 但是，不代表发动机在1250转到4000转范围内时就一定是250Nm的扭矩，注意那个节气门全开工况。\n1.2 有一个重要的参数叫扭矩响应速度\n将发动机维持在10%节气门状态下平稳运行，突然输入【节气门全开】的指令，测量发动机的输出扭矩需要多少时间可以达到外特性曲线。 测量出的时间称为扭矩响应速度，一般以毫秒为单位。\n如果你了解发动机原理，就应该明白，扭矩∝喷油量∝进气量，所谓扭矩响应速度可以说就是进气速度。靠气缸容积形成的真空，来抽吸进气的速度是最快的！涡轮增压器是需要排气来驱动的。\n这个参数通常是这样的：自然吸气发动机的扭矩响应速度在200～400毫秒；涡轮增压进气发动机的扭矩响应速度在1500毫秒以上。\n只不过，涡轮增压进气发动机的最大扭矩是远高于自然吸气发动机的，虽然都是达到外特性曲线，但涡轮增压发动机的外特性曲线更高。\n下面上图，本田L15B7 1.5T涡轮增压发动机的万有特性图。图中红线是我画上去的，表示自吸段与增压段的分界线，红线以下区域的扭矩，通过自然进气就可以达到；红线以上则必须提高进气压力才能达到。如果驾驶员踩下油门踏板后，MCU计算后认为仅仅通过开大节气门就可以达到，那么发动机的扭矩响应是很快的，上面讲过了，200～400毫秒；如果驾驶员使劲踩了油门，MCU计算后发现需要在增压段才能达到，那么MCU会控制关小排气旁路阀、投入涡轮增压器运行，在一段时间后达到目标扭矩。\n\n1.3 最大扭矩转速低，是削峰的结果\n至于为什么要降低最大扭矩，简单说是被缸温、缸压限制了，在此不详述，希望了解的话可以自行学习。\n\n\n\n2.什么样的是好发动机\n热效率是衡量热机技术水准的唯一标准。\n低成本、高可靠性且热效率突出、动力充足、NVH达标的发动机当然是好发动机。\n低成本是关键，奔驰在F1赛事中使用的50%热效率发动机和各位一点关系都没有，成本在1万元以下的发动机才是普通人能消费起的发动机。\n高可靠性无需多言。\n两个前置条件满足了，同时还具有40%热效率、充足的动力、不错的NVH，这样的发动机是许多主机厂的奢望。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n广龙先生\n点击下载\n58 个回答，查看全部。\n为什么发动机上最大扭矩不能转化为轮上最大扭矩?\n为什么丰田的2.0发动机有两种功率?",

          "description": "在CES 2022上，索尼公开了第二款概念车VISION-S 0 SUV，而且索尼董事长、总裁兼首席执行官吉田健一郎宣布索尼集团将成立新的部门——索尼移动公司（Sony Mobility Inc），该公司预计在今年春季成立，主要专注于电动汽车商业化。\n\n\nVision-S 02由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队打造，看着看着，这可能成为走向一个新型电动汽车公司的方向么？\n\n\n备注：造车这个事情，戴森走了一轮没走下去。\n\n\n▲图1.Sony的Vision S两款概念车\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\nVision S系列的重点\n\n\n这款概念车是索尼Vision-S由索尼人工智能团队和机器人团队来牵头的（机器狗产品Aibo），并且还拉着好几家其他公司来做，包括：NVIDIA、高通、采埃孚、博世（很多部件）、黑莓、QNX、Conti（大量的开发ECU）、本特勒（底盘和电池）、麦格纳（整个EE设计）等等。这个系列最大的特色，还是Vision-S车身内外部署了一套完整的、面向高阶自动驾驶的传感器套件，目的是提供全景影像、360音效、全时连接等特性。\n\n\nSony Vision上的40 个传感器分为：\n16 个 Camera：分为外部8个，分别是环视 4个（IMX390）、侧后摄像头2个（IMX390*2）+、侧视2个（IMX490*2）、内部8个，分别为两个前视立体相机（IMX490*2）、两个ToF 相机（IMX456*2）、驾驶员监控*1、行车记录*1、后摄像头和内部电子个1个、18 个超声波/雷达传感器和 4 个 LiDAR 传感器。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图2.Sony 的Vision S\n\n\n而这台索尼Vision-S的原型车，已经在奥地利参加了公开的路面测试。\n从逻辑上，这是所有参与整个系统构建的一个技术演示，围绕5G技术，可以把诸多感知的电子技术，通过车载系统和云端之间实现高速、高容量和低延迟的连接。也就是说，通过索尼，合作的小伙伴们把VIsion-S打造为一种移动的娱乐空间。\n对于Sony而言，最重要的是需要一个展示的渠道，把Sony在内容、游戏体验和音频上体现出来。通过对VIsion-S的探索，以及合作伙伴的支持，在“移动娱乐空间”这个方向可以有了更多的发展空间。\n\n\n我们仔细研究Sony的业务构成，就能发现索尼已经变成一个围绕游戏机、内容（音乐+电影）的公司。传统上，我们对sony的认知，电子产品只占了1/4不到的业务，而图像传感器CIS是很重要的一块业务。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图3.Sony FY21 Q2的业务构成\n\n\n也就是说，概念车所隶属的Electronics Products & Solutions这个部门，现在已经是一个独立的业务部门。\n从这个意义上来看，Sony和现在苹果的公司结构不一样。苹果可以围绕Apple Car（据说最近苹果抽调了很多资源去做AR和元宇宙了）不停撒钱；Sony肯定和戴森一样烧钱，成立这个业务部门做什么呢？\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图4.索尼的概念车隶属于一个小部门\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\nSony的CIS和激光雷达\n\n\n在Sony科技日展示的内容里面，很重要的一部分就是激光雷达：\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图5.索尼的激光雷达视频\n\n\n有一个重要的背景是，Sony到现在的CIS业务中，在汽车市场里面的占比很低。可以说，索尼的图像传感器CIS部分的新业务开拓，目前还局限在日本车企部分使用，索尼是想通过ADAS领域的需求，能够把自己在移动领域的优势发挥出来。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图6.后疫情时代索尼对于CIS的预测\n\n\n在Vision S系列里面，最多的还是摄像头——这些东西可以作为一个展示给全球汽车企业的方案，并在这个细分市场对安森美进行超越。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图7.Sony的优势CIS领域在汽车里面没做起来\n\n\n\n▲图8.Sony的图像传感器在汽车领域的应用\n\n\n而且一旦有了这个平台，在各项业务和内容中，可以比较容易找到合作伙伴，特别是Sony较少接触的OEM的直接需求——我个人判断这个才是重点，眼下自己去做个汽车公司，完全是得不偿失的事情。\n\n\n\n\n\n▲图9.汽车使用的图像传感器，Sony起步较晚\n\n\n\n小结：我个人判断，除了中国和美国，传统欧洲和日本很难出现创业汽车公司，而这两个地方也没有所谓的软件巨头，戴森和Sony这样做产品的公司进入汽车行业也很难赢。\n我想下一步就ADAS摄像头和汽车CIS这个市场进行打开分析，可能效果好一些。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n朱玉龙\n点击下载",

          "description": "我职业生涯的大部分时间都是自由职业者。有时候，我也会和一些想要辞掉全职工作去做一些承包或服务业务的人聊天。到目前为止，我们新手最常犯的错误就是为自己定价。\n\r\n以 这篇有用的博客文章为例，它分析了美国雇员与自由职业者的收入间的对比。据估计，在美国，作为一名自由职业者，你需要获得 14 万美元的收入，才能获得相当于 10 万美元的雇员薪酬。我记得当我第一次创业时，我发现这样的计算非常有用。而，有些人看到结果会想：“哎呀，如果我是自由职业者，我得赚 1.4 倍的钱。我真的能做到吗？”\n\r\n不，不，不，这种想法是落后的。\n\r\n如何给自己定价\n\r\n让我们举个例子。假设你是一名全职软件工程师，年收入 10 万美元，你正考虑转成承保。\n\r\n当你是自由职业者时候，你必须像做企业一样思考，因为这就是你的谋生方式。所以，你必须把所有的成本加起来，并计算出如何收回这些成本。电子表格的口碑很差（有一些很好的理由），但它们实际上非常有用，尤其是对这些东西（以及作为企业主要进行的许多其他计算）。\n\r\n第一个要加入统计的成本是那 10 万美元。如果这听起来很奇怪，那就是所谓的“机会成本”。你本可以继续工作以赚到 10 万美元；而没有赚到这 10 万美元，实际上是在规划业务时的一种成本。把这一费用和其他你实际使用的任何其它就业福利一起记下来。如果你的雇主提供工作日午餐，那就加上一年中每个工作日午餐的费用。如果你的雇主为员工提供健身软件的折扣，但你却没有使用该软件，那么不要将该福利作为机会成本。\n\r\n其他费用取决于你在做什么和你住在哪里。员工医疗保险在澳大利亚不像在美国那么重要。另一方面，强制性养老金支付（类似于美国的 401(K) 计划）是一个大问题。我有自己的公司，我的主要非工资成本是保险、会计/档案、法律（合同审查等）、债务催收和各种在线服务成本。如果你在计算一些耐用的东西（比如一张桌子），把成本除…",

          "description": "这的确是个好消息！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你喜欢玩复古游戏，你可能已经接触过复古游戏机模拟器。顺便说一句，所谓“模拟器Emulator”（仿真器）主要是指允许主机系统运行为另一系统设计的游戏的软件或硬件。\n\r\n最近，Cemu 成功引起了开源社区的注意力。它是众多复古电子游戏模拟器之一，可以让你玩为任天堂 Wii U 定制的游戏。然而，到目前为止，它在一个主要方面与大多数模拟器不同，即它是闭源的，但这即将改变。\n\r\nCemu 简介\n\r\nCemu 是一个流行的基于软件的复古电子游戏模拟器，专门模拟任天堂 Wii U 游戏，它是这类模拟器中第一个。它利用了 OpenGL 和 Vulkan 来运行游戏。\n\r\n多年来，它已经有了显著的进展，现在可以 玩整个 Wii U 库中的 51% 的游戏。这包括《马里奥卡丁车 8》和《塞尔达传说：荒野之息》等热门游戏。\n\r\n虽然它早在 2015 年就发布了，但 Cemu 只能运行在 Windows 上。不过，开发者发布的新路线图指出，Cemu 应该很快就会移植到 Linux 上了。\n\r\n而且，最令人关注的是，Cemu 将走向开源！\n\r\n通往开源和 Linux 之路\n\r\n路线图总共包括了由开发人员计划的八个里程碑。其中包括计划开发一个 Linux 移植版并向社区提供代码。\n\r\n谈到 Cemu 的开源问题，开发者计划在 2022 年完成这一工作。所以，你不应该对此寄予厚望。\n\r\n迁移到 Linux 涉及到将源代码从 C 语言改写成 C++ 语言，并从 Visual Studio 迁移到 cmake。\n\r\n以下是开发者对将 Cemu 引入 Linux 的看法：\n\r\n\r\n我们最终想提供一个原生的 Linux 版本。这一直是一个正在进行的副计划，尽管由于优先级较低和依赖于其他任务而进展相对缓慢，但现在已经完成了大约 70% 的工作。\n\r\n\r\n开发人员还提到，移植过程伴随着其他工作，如软件 H264 解码器和 cubeb 后端。由于主要的工作已经完成，可以说 Cemu 很快就会出现在 Linux 上。\n\r\n其他计划\n\r\n开发人员已经考虑将 LLVM 作为 CPU JIT 后端，用于将 PowerPC（Wii U 的主机架构）转换为 ARM 等 X86 架构。\n\r\n他们还刚刚开始着手开发一个新的着色器反编译器，以减少着色器编译时间和卡顿。\n\r\n你可以参考 官方路线图 了解更多细节。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n这对渴望做出贡献并使 Cemu 变得更好的复古游戏爱好者来说绝对是一份大礼。\n\r\nCemu 最终将加入许多流行的、开源的任天堂游戏机模拟器的行列，如 Citra、Dolphin 和 Yuzu。\n\r\n你对 Cemu 的开源有什么看法？复古游戏模拟器应该是闭源的还是开源的？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/cemu-nintendo-linux/\n\r\n作者：Rishabh Moharir 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "星链卫星影响的图像两年间增加了 35 倍\n\r\nSpaceX 旗下“星链”互联网服务需要在轨运行密集的卫星群来提供低延迟网络连接服务。目前已有超过 1500 颗在轨卫星，美国 FCC 此前已经批准了 12000 颗星链卫星的发射。在过去的两年时间里，受星链卫星轨迹影响的图像数量 增加了 35 倍。研究人员估计，如果星链按计划发射所有卫星，几乎每一张观测图像中都至少有一条星链卫星的轨迹。SpaceX 在新一代星链卫星上安装了遮光罩，使卫星亮度下降了大约 4.6 倍，但仍然高于解决问题设定的目标。目前图像中的星链卫星轨迹细小，加之可以通过软件进行识别并处理，所以对天文观测的影响不算大。研究人员估计，目前而言，因为与星链卫星轨迹重合而导致错过罕见天文事件的概率只有 0.04%，但对黄昏观测影响最为严重。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这一问题会随着卫星数量的增加而进一步恶化。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n2021 年针对 Linux 的恶意软件增长了 35%\n\r\n根据 一份报告，2021 年，针对 Linux 系统的恶意软件与 2020 年相比上升了 35%。XorDDoS、Mirai 和 Mozi 是最普遍的系列，占 2021 年观察到的所有针对 Linux 的恶意软件攻击的 22%。之前的 另外一份报告 也证实了这个增长趋势，发现 2020 年 Linux 恶意软件家族比前一年增加了 40%。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：从好的地方看，这代表 Linux 越来越流行了 🤣\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFFmpeg 5.0 发布\n\r\nFFmpeg 被多媒体应用广泛使用，其中之一是 VLC。在这个 版本 中，删除了大量废弃的 API，其中一些 API 甚至在 2013 年就被标识为废弃了，在这个版本之前已经有 4 年没有删除过废弃 API 了。所以如果你的应用使用了废弃 API 的话，请注意升级问题。除了 API 方面的变化，此版本还增加了许多功能，详情请参考 变更日志。此外，FFmpeg 将从 5.0 开始转向基于时间的发布节奏，预期每年都发布一个重大版本，以及每隔一年一个 LTS 版本，5.0 将是第一个 LTS 版本。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然这个软件自己都没有个 GUI，但是却是很多华丽的多媒体应用的动力所在。",

          "description": "配置你的系统使用无根容器。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n容器是现代计算的一个重要组成部分，随着围绕容器的基础设施的发展，新的和更好的工具开始浮出水面。过去，你只需用 LXC 就可以运行容器，然而随着 Docker 得到了普及，它开始变得越来越复杂。最终，我们在 Podman 得到了我们所期望的容器管理系统：一个无守护进程的容器引擎，它使容器和吊舱易于构建、运行和管理。\n\r\n容器直接与 Linux 内核能力（如控制组和命名空间）交互，它们在这些命名空间中产生大量的新进程。简而言之，运行一个容器实际上就是在 Linux 系统内部运行一个 Linux 系统。从操作系统的角度来看，它看起来非常像一种管理和特权活动。普通用户通常不能像容器那样自由支配系统资源，所以默认情况下，运行 Podman 需要 root 或 sudo 权限。然而，这只是默认设置，而且这绝不是唯一可用的设置。本文演示了如何配置你的 Linux 系统，使普通用户可以在不使用 sudo 的情况下（“无根rootless”）运行 Podman。\n\r\n命名空间的用户 ID\n\r\n内核命名空间 本质上是一种虚构的结构，可帮助 Linux 跟踪哪些进程属于同一类。这是 Linux 中的“队列护栏”。一个队列中的进程与另一个队列中的进程之间实际上没有区别，但可以将它们用“警戒线”彼此隔离。要声明一组进程为“容器”，而另一组进程为你的操作系统，将它们分开是关键。\n\r\nLinux 通过用户 ID（UID）和组 ID（GID）来跟踪哪个用户或组拥有的进程。通常情况下，一个用户可以访问一千个左右的从属 UID，以分配给命名空间的子进程。由于 Podman 运行的是分配给启动容器的用户的整个从属操作系统，因此你需要的不仅仅是默认分配的从属 UID 和从属 GID。\n\r\n你可以用 usermod 命令授予一个用户更多的从属 UID 和从属 GID。例如，要授予用户 tux 更多的从属 UID 和从属 GID，选择一个还没分配用户的适当的高 UID（如 200000），然后将其增加几千：\n\r\n$ sudo usermod \\\r\n    --add-subuids 200000-265536 \\\r\n    --add-subgids 200000-265536 \\\r\n    tux\r\n\n\r\n命名空间访问\n\r\n对命名空间数量也有限制。这通常被设置得很高。你可以用 systctl，即内核参数工具来验证用户的命名空间分配：\n\r\n$ sysctl --all --pattern user_namespaces\r\nuser.max_user_namespaces = 28633\r\n\n\r\n这是很充足的命名空间，而且可能是你的发行版默认设置的。如果你的发行版没有这个属性或者设置得很低，那么你可以在文件 /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf 中输入这样的文本来创建它：\n\r\nuser.max_user_namespaces=28633\r\n\n\r\n加载该设置：\n\r\n$ sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\r\n\n\r\n在没有 root 权限的情况下运行一个容器\n\r\n当你设置好你的配置，重启你的计算机，以确保你的用户和内核参数的变化被加载和激活。\n\r\n重启后，试着运行一个容器镜像：\n\r\n$ podman run -it busybox echo \"hello\"\r\nhello\r\n\n\r\n容器像命令一样\n\r\n如果你是第一次接触容器，可能会觉得很神秘，但实际上，它们与你现有的 Linux 系统没有什么不同。它们实际上是在你的系统上运行的进程，没有仿真环境或虚拟机的成本和障碍。容器和你的操作系统之间的区别只是内核命名空间，所以它们实际上只是带有不同标签的本地进程。Podman 使这一点比以往更加明显，当你将 Podman 配置为无根命令，容器感觉更像命令而不是虚拟环境。Podman 使容器和吊舱变得简单，所以请试一试。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/run-containers-without-sudo-podman\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这是 Linux 走向大众最重要的一件事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n你可能看过 最近 Linus Tech Tips 关于切换到 Linux 的视频，以及 他对 KDE 软件的一些抱怨的那个视频。对于那些关注此事的人，我想让你们知道，我们（KDE）正在努力修复 Linus 提出的问题，你们可以在 这里 跟踪我们的进展。值得庆幸的是，大部分的问题都相当小，应该很容易解决。\n\r\n关于桌面 Linux 需要什么才能成为主流的问题。Sway 开发者 Drew DeVault 针对该视频发表了一篇文章，而这篇博文是我的版本。Drew 强调了可访问性，我也同意，但结论略有不同。\n\r\n桌面 Linux 需要预装在零售硬件上才能在主流市场取得成功\n\r\n就是这样。\n\r\n请允许我解释一下。\n\r\n人们经常被功能和可用性所困扰，这些都很重要，但它们只是达到目的的手段，本身并不是目的。如果人们根本不能得到它，质量就毫无意义。而如果没有可访问的发行版，人们就无法得到它。高质量的 Linux 发行版还不够；它们需要被预装在你可以在主流零售店买到的硬件产品上。“主流人群”会购买他们可以触摸和拿起的产品；如果在主流商店找不到它，它就不存在。\n\r\n想一想，为什么普通人都使用 Windows 或 macOS？因为他们购买的实体电脑包含了它。iOS 或 Android 呢？它被默认装在了他们的实体智能手机上。对于“主流人群”来说，不存在用一个新的操作系统替换设备的操作系统的想法。只有 “三点”用户 才会这么做，而他们只占市场的 5% 左右。如果获得你的操作系统的唯一途径是自己安装，那么你就没有机会在主流市场取得成功。\n\r\n\n\r\n至于功能，人们通常只使用可用功能的很小的一部分。在可用性方面，大多数用户是 记住他们的软件如何使用而不是理解它 —— 如果你真的需要，你可以记住任何东西。一个更好的用户界面会有所帮助，但是对于那些记忆这些的人来说并不是必需的，而它主要有利于那些能够识别模式，并欣赏逻辑、一致性和良好设计的高级用户（市场上 30% 的“二点及以上”人群）。因此，这些东西本身就不够好。\n\r\n但这并不意味着我们应该忘记功能和可用性！一点也不。但是如果我们的目标是“走向主流”，我们就必须了解真正的受众：是硬件供应商，而不是终端用户。我们的目标是让软件产品有足够的吸引力，以便在供应商选购时被他们选中，因为它基本上就是这样做的。像苹果这样为知名产品定制自上而下的硬件和软件的公司很少。大多数公司都建立在第三方软件之上，这些软件需要他们内部软件团队进行最少的整合和定制工作。如果你的软件不能胜任，他们会转向下一个选择。因此，当一些硬件供应商有需求时，你的软件最好已经准备好了！\n\r\n而硬件供应商需要什么？\n\r\n\r\n灵活性。你的软件必须容易适应他们的任何类型的设备，而不需要大量的定制工程，他们将在产品的生命周期中负责支持。\n\r\n能使他们的设备看起来不错的功能。对其物理硬件特性的支持、良好的性能、令人愉快的用户界面……人们购买它的理由基本上是这些。\n\r\n稳定性。不能崩溃并将用户抛弃在命令行终端提示符下。必须可以实际工作。不能让人感觉像一个业余的科学展览会项目。\n\r\n可用性要足够好，以减少支持成本。当出现问题时，“主流人群”会联系他们的硬件供应商。可用性需要足够好，以便尽可能少地发生这种情况。\n\r\n\r\n它不需要完美。它只需要做这些事情。这就是 Windows 在 90 年代征服了个人电脑市场的方式，尽管它很糟糕！而我们的东西要好得多！\n\r\n我看到有证据表明 KDE 已经是这样了。Pine 在 PinePhone 和 PineBook Pro 上分别为 Manjaro 提供了 Plasma 的移动版和桌面版。Valve 也为 Steam Deck 选择了 Plasma 的桌面版，在他们的新版 SteamOS 中取代了 GNOME。我认为 KDE 软件定位良好，并且一直在变得更好。因此，让我们继续加倍努力提供硬件供应商销售其出色产品所需的东西。\n\r\n原文由 KDE 开发者 Nate Graham 发表在他的 博客 PointiestStick 中。 本文经许可后转载。所表达的观点代表作者自己，可能不能反映我们的观点。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/what-desktop-linux-needs-to-succeed-in-the-mainstream/\n\r\n作者：Nate Graham 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "提前了解一下 Pop!_OS 即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境。仅供参考。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你还不知道，System76 的开发者一直在 致力于开发一个新的桌面环境（被称为 COSMIC），它是用 Rust 编写的，Rust 是一种内存安全的超快编程语言。\n\r\n从头开始创建一个桌面环境不是一件小事。这涉及到创建从合成器、面板、窗口管理器到桌面环境的 API 和其他后端任务的一切。\n\r\n这不是一件容易的事，而维护它又是另一回事。\n\r\n而且，看起来 System76 已经开始了这方面的工作。\n\r\n在 GitHub 上，你会发现已经有一个名为 cosmic 的仓库，但它主要是使用 JavaScript（用于创建 GNOME shell 扩展的语言）编写的。这就是 cosmic shell 扩展仓库，也就是 Pop!_OS 现在所搭载的。\n\r\n在他们的 GitHub 中还有几个较新的仓库，这些恰好是他们即将推出的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面的元素。\n\r\n所以，现在是时候构建、测试并提前了解一下了。\n\r\n\r\n注： 澄清一下，目前 Pop!_OS 上基于 GNOME 的桌面环境叫做 COSMIC。而本文讨论的是基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面环境，它是从头开始构建的，旨在取代当前的产品。\n\r\n\r\n基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验\n\r\n打算成为 COSMIC 桌面环境整体一部分的三个仓库是：\n\r\n\r\n设置应用\n\r\n顶部面板（目前用于 X11 系统）\n\r\n合成器（似乎支持原生的 wayland、xwayland 和 X11 系统）\n\r\n\r\nCOSMIC 设置应用\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n注意： 这是一个半生不熟的早期预览，以让你有个大致印象。随着开发的继续，用户界面可能会有根本性的变化。所以，仅用于参考。\n\r\n\r\n这是 Pop!_OS 的新 COSMIC 桌面的设置应用。它目前还在开发当中，没有准备好使用，不过如果你想运行它并试试界面，请随意！\n\r\n那么，它看起来与目前的 COSMIC 体验有什么不同呢？\n\r\n\n\r\n在写这篇文章时，该用户界面似乎没有与任何后端 API 相连接。启用和禁用 “为工作区启用左上角热角 ”的切换并没有什么变化，其他的切换也是如此，除了设置应用的 “关于” 部分所显示的信息。\n\r\n仔细看截图，放置的位置很凌乱，但作为早期预览（或原型）来说也是正常的。\n\r\n看起来他们正在用圆角和更干净的外观来处理一切。\n\r\n切换动画感觉快速、流畅和迅捷（即使是在虚拟机内，我等不及在裸机上尝试）。但考虑到它甚至还没有功能，谈论性能没什么意义。\n\r\n\n\r\n就个人而言，我不喜欢他们所采用的圆角外观。在我看来，GNOME 对圆角的实现是完美的。但是，看看它的结果应该是很有趣的。\n\r\n顶部面板\n\r\n作为 COSMIC 桌面环境的一部分，顶部面板也正在使用 Rust 语言实现。\n\r\n至于这个顶部面板的外观，我不太确定如何测试它才不算对它不公平。从 GNOME 中启动它，会在 GNOME 的顶栏后面打开它。所以我想在一个单独的窗口管理器中打开它（到目前为止只用 bspwm 和 i3-wm 试过），但这导致了一些古怪的行为，比如面板像普通 GUI 软件一样占据了全部垂直空间。\n\r\nCOSMIC 合成器\n\r\nCOSMIC 桌面环境的合成器编译成功了，但在与 bspwm 或 i3-wm 一起使用时却无法启动。我试着在窗口管理器中启动它，因为 GNOME 不允许改变合成器。\n\r\n这是由于在使用 VirtualBox 的虚拟机中，视频驱动的混乱以及 COSMIC 合成器还没有准备好。\n\r\n但是，还有更多！\n\r\n开发者 Eduardo Flores 也尝试了新的 COSMIC 桌面，在他的 博客文章 中分享了一些应用启动器和坞站的截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n应用程序启动器看起来很相似，但是使用 GTK 构建的。同样，你也可以期待 Pop!_OS 21.10 引入一个类似的应用程序库，以及经典的坞站。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n当然，现在说发展的方向还为时过早。\n\r\n要期待一个成熟的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面体验的测试版，应该还需要一段时间。\n\r\n但是，从我们在这里看到的情况来看，我很兴奋。\n\r\n你怎么看？欢迎你在下面的评论中分享你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/system76-rust-cosmic-desktop/\n\r\n作者：Pratham Patel 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "机器学习方案将帮助不同的无线电协议，如 Wi-Fi 和 LTE，在同一的无线频谱中更有效地协同工作。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）开发的机器学习方案有可能显著改善 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率的方式。研究人员声称，与试错法相比，NIST 的方案可以使共享通信频率的过程的效率提高多达 5000 倍。\n\r\nNIST 系统的理念是，无线电设备可以从经验中学习其网络环境，而不是像现在这样，简单地根据试错法选择频率信道。\n\r\nNIST 在 其网站上的一篇文章 中说，在特定的环境条件下，“该算法可以学习哪个信道提供最好的结果”。\n\r\n该团队说:“该方案可以被编程到现实世界中许多 [不同] 类型网络的发射机软件中。”\n\r\n从本质上讲，这个计算机模拟的算法是一个映射环境射频条件的先前经验的公式。例如，这些条件可以包括在一个信道（一组相邻的频率）内运行的发射机的数量。\n\r\n文章说：“……如果发射机选择了一个未被占用的信道，那么成功传输的概率就会上升，从而导致更高的数据速率。”同样地，当发射机选择一个没有太多干扰的信道时，信号会更强，你也会得到更好的数据速率。发射机会记住哪个信道提供了最佳结果，并学会在下次需要清晰信号时学会选择那个位置。\n\r\n这与今天的工作方式不同。也就是说，无线电只是试图找到一个开放频率，然后与类似协议的无线电进行通信。在复杂的情况下，使用诸如 Wi-Fi、跳频和 波束成形 等技术来优化信道。\n\r\n研究人员解释说，NIST 的机器学习技术的亮点在于共享频谱，比如通过授权频谱辅助接入（LAA）共享 Wi-Fi。LAA 是非授权频谱中的 LTE 频谱，称为 LTE-U，频率为 5GHz。在相同频率下的 Wi-Fi 与 LAA 的组合中，协议是不同的：无线电之间不能相互通信以协调工作，而且频带越繁忙就可能出现混乱 —— 传输会遇到其他传输。但是，如果所有的无线电接收机都能更好地选择它们的占位，通过学习哪些有效，哪些无效，那么这将会更好。\n\r\nNIST 工程师 Jason Coder 在文章中说：“这可能会使非授权频段的通信更加高效。”\n\r\n事实上，NIST 声称，它“可以帮助 5G 和其他无线网络选择和共享通信频率，其效率大约是试错法的 5000 倍。”\n\r\n这里的关键词是“共享”，因为为了在有限的频谱内增加通信，必须进行更多的共享 —— 物联网或媒体流等用户都在争夺同样的隐喻资产。随着物联网和数字技术的不断发展，非授权和授权频段的结合，就像 LAA 中的情况一样，可能会变得更加普遍。（非授权的频段是指那些没有分配给特定用户的频段，比如移动网络运营商；授权频段是在拍卖中中标并分配的。）\n\r\n在 NIST 场景中，相互竞争的发射机“各自学习在不相互通信的情况下最大化网络数据速率”。因此，多种协议和数据类型，如视频或传感器数据，或 Wi-Fi 和移动网络，可以相互协作。\n\r\nNIST 的方案大大简化了为发射机分配最佳信道的过程，根据这篇文章研究发现，穷尽努力 [使用试错法] 来确定最佳解决方案需要大约 45600 次试验，而这个方案只需要尝试 10 个渠道就可以选择类似的解决方案，仅仅付出 0.02% 的努力。”\n\r\nNIST 的研究人员在 IEEE 第 91 届车辆技术会议上展示了他们的研究成果。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3561618/nist-aims-to-make-frequency-sharing-more-efficient-for-wireless-networks.html\n\r\n作者：Patrick Nelson 选题：lujun9972 译者：CN-QUAN 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "什么是不跟随\n这段时间打 VALORANT ，有个队友只要一起打了，话题里总少不了「鼠标」和「握姿」这两个关键词。于是一个朋友受不了了，跟我吐槽。\n首先让我们明确一点，你玩任何游戏，上限一定不是你的鼠标和你的握姿。决定你上限的只有你的训练量和你的年龄。打不准，那就多练；反应慢，一个是多练，还有一个就是你不再年轻。\n这个队友呢，年纪比较小，还没有形成自己的一套体系。所以总是想跟着 UP 主的理论去选择自己的鼠标。并且对于握姿的选择非常纠结，总是在为了「哪个握姿上限更高」这样的问题来回矛盾。那么就让我们再明确一次，握姿与你的上限无关。举个很简单的例子，CSGO 传奇选手 Simple 的鼠标握姿既不是抓握也不是趴握更不是指握，而是将趴握和抓握混合在一起运用。\n所谓「不跟随」，在上一篇我说过，对于游戏设备，我们「更多的关注应该在，它是不是符合你的需求」。盲目地迷信传感器参数或者鼠标尺寸与手掌大小这些参数，并不能帮你找到合适的鼠标并且提升能力。一千个人的心中有一千个哈姆雷特，同样，对于鼠标的选择，每个人都是不一样的。别人的数据只是参考，真正应该关注的，反而应该是自己的使用体验。\n\n我的选择与标准\n首先，让我们看看鼠标类型\n鼠标无非两种类型，一种是对称鼠标，一种是人体工学鼠标。而人体工学鼠标往往很多厂家又会对它在某些方面进行优化。总体来讲就是这两大类。\n对称鼠标的代表，近几年比较火的，就是罗技的 G pro wireless 与雷蛇的毒蝰系列。人体工学鼠标的代表就是 Steelseries 当年为微软代工的 IE 3.0 系列鼠标。喜欢用哪一种，因人而异。有的人喜欢对称，有的人喜欢人体工学，甚至有人喜欢强制人体工学。对称鼠标，就如同名字一样，鼠标是对称的。人体工学鼠标，是贴合人手放松状态下的模样做出的鼠标，因此这种类型的鼠标与手的贴合度高，手指有充分的休息区域。\n再来，我的选择标准\n…",

          "description": "allenchen10: \nTLDR\nV2Reader 是一个用 SwiftUI 开发的，在 iOS 、iPadOS 和 macOS 上的 V2EX 第三方客户端。因为所有的数据都是通过访问 V2EX API 2.0 Beta 来获取的，而这份文档还在更新，有很多数据没有提供，所以 V2Reader 的功能还比较有限。之后随着 API 的更新，会有更多功能加入。\n简介\n我前段时间看到 V2EX API 2.0 的页面，就试了试，当时还提了一个小 Issue，站长很快就修复了。那个时候刚好还在放假，想着入门一下 iOS 开发，然后用这些 API 写一个客户端练手。之后大概花了两周时间开发到当前版本，目前只用了 SwiftUI 原生的组件，没有使用第三方库。因为才刚接触 Swift ，基本是一边学一边写，很多地方的代码还有点乱，等以后整理好了应该会开源。\n安装\n加入 Beta 版“V2Reader for V2EX” - TestFlight - Apple\n设备要求\niOS/iPadOS 15 以上，或者 macOS 12 Monterey 以上（使用了 Catalyst ，所以 Intel Mac 也可以安装）。\n功能\n通过不同节点访问主题以及回复\n\n搜索节点并关注或者将节点添加到主页\n\n点击发布者或回复者的用户名查看用户信息\n\n自动在 @用户 后添加楼层号，可以点击跳转到对应的楼层，然后点击蓝色箭头跳回原楼层\n\niPad 版本以三列视图显示，支持分屏或小窗模式\n\nMac Catalyst 版本\n\nFAQ\n为什么不支持更低的系统版本？\n主要是因为我用了很多去年 WWDC 新加入的语法，比如 AsyncImage 、MainActor 、task 、refreshable 、searchable 之类的。\n为什么 API 2.0 Beta 已经有了获取提醒的 API ，但软件内还没有实现？\n有两个原因：一、这个 API 获取的内容都是 HTML 格式的，我还没有考虑用什么方式去解析，不像帖子中的内容是 Markdown 格式的，可以用 iOS 15 新引入的 AttributedString 。二、这个提醒 API 还获取不到帖子的 id ，暂时也没办法实现点击跳转帖子的功能。\n为什么有些 Markdown 格式的内容没有正常显示？\n因为 AttributedString 还没有支持 Markdown 格式的全部语法，我猜测下次 WWDC 会支持更多。\n为什么不支持 App 内发帖 /回帖 /收藏 /感谢等功能？\n我暂时打算只使用 API 2.0 Beta ，而这些数据目前还无法通过这些接口获取。当然如果需要的人很多，我之后可能会用解析网页之类的方式来实现。目前点击发帖回帖的按钮会跳转到网页版。\n为什么需要用 Token 来登录？可不可以使用账号密码或者免登录？\nV2EX API 2.0 Beta 必须有 Token 才能够访问，用户需要在设置中自己创建 Token ，然后复制粘贴到 App 中，App 会将 Token 放入系统的 Keychain 保存。用 Token 是否安全，可以参考站长 @Livid 在这个帖子中的回复。\n为什么使用一段时间之后加载不出内容了，重新启动之后显示 Token 无效？\n站长设置了每小时最多请求 API 600 次，这种情况可能是达到了限制，可以等整点后再尝试。\n为什么主页中最多只能添加 5 个节点？\n主页每次刷新时，每个节点都需要单独访问一次 API ，主页中包含的节点过多会导致很快达到 API 请求次数的上限，目前设置的是最多 5 个，如果觉得不够请在 TestFlight 里反馈，我会考虑在之后的版本里调整。\n最后\n我写这个 App 只是作为学习 Swift 的练手，目前支持的功能还不多，并不能代替网页版或者别的优秀 App ，大家有兴趣的话欢迎加入 TestFlight 测试体验，反馈使用中的问题和需要改进的地方。",

          "description": "aaatches: 垃圾短信已经无法阻挡，哪怕 V 站首推的熊猫吃短信也必须经过精确调教才好使。\n尝试着半年时间把所有短信通知都禁用了，没想到不仅不会影响日常生活，而且体验相当不错。这里分享一下我觉得大家会关注的一个问题：禁用短信通知为什么不会影响日常生活\n1.验证码通知\n虽然各种验证码已经渗透到日常生活中，但一般收到验证码之前我们自己肯定是知道的，所以在收到验证码后哪怕没有通知也不影响，只要打开信息 app 就可以看到验证码了。而且苹果手机即使禁用了短信通知，只能填充验证码的功能依然正常使用\n2.收快递通知\n短信通知收快递都不会是很急的那种。最常见的是快递柜，可以放一段时间不用急着去拿。如果平时有习惯追踪自己的快递在哪一天到的话，不需要短信通知也能够知道大概哪一天会有快递。\n3.扣费通知\n这个虽然有点危险，但如果平时养成习惯保护好自己的信用卡的话其实影响也不大。这个我推荐平时少使用实体卡，多使用 apple pay 等电子媒介，安全性会更高\n剩下的对于我来说已经没有任何需要关注的短信了，收不到这些短信是一种幸福",

          "description": "golangLover: \n最近在管理 gradle / maven 写的源码，想问下平时是不需要做这个传递依赖的冲突检查吗，等抛出异常的时候才做还是每次安装依赖的时候都要做一次？\n最怕的问题在于不知道为什么编译期的版本冲突没有检查出来。而我们已经依赖了好多个 library,例如库 A 依赖 库 C 和库 D 的 1.0 ，但是库 B 是依赖库 C 和 D 的 2.0 。\n我在网上看了 maven 和 gradle 会自动帮我以某种最短路径策略去选择依赖库。但是这种选择我也不懂是不是能够保证选择出来的版本就是没问题的，总不能每次都重新测试整个 app 吧。\n而这种传递依赖的层级可能有 3/4 层。而我恰好前两天就遇到一个 java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError 。查了一下好像是关于依赖不兼容的问题， 编译期间没有检查出来，还是使用哪个 method 的时候才出现的 runtime exception 。\n问题是我在最上层 dependency management 例如写了是 2.0 ，那我也不能保证依赖 1.0 的一定没问题的。但写成 2.0 的，那风险也同样大。\n所以想向大家求教应该怎么做依赖的管理的最好方法。谢谢大家",

          "description": "CloudStorage: \n前言\n随着业务规模的不断扩大，企业越来越重视构建高性能、高可用的大型分布式系统。为了解决应用耦合，合理进行流量削锋，腾讯云提供了包括 CKafka 和 TDMQ 在内的一系列消息队列中间件。为了更方便地对消息队列中的数据进行转存和持久化，腾讯云对象存储 COS 为用户提供了云消息队列备份的能力。\n一、云消息队列备份方案-使用 COS 应用集成备份\nCOS 应用集成 是腾讯云对象存储 COS 基于 Serverless 云函数，为开发者提供的存储数据应用解决方案。开发者只需要在 COS 控制台一键配置，即可使用丰富的功能。\nCOS 应用集成提供了云消息队列备份的能力，开发者可以轻松配置定时备份任务，将云消息队列中的消息记录以文件的形式转至对象存储，以便进行持久化保存。开发者可以通过备份文件提取消息记录，对消息进行入库、统计分析等操作。\n\n二、方案优势\n存储成本低：对象存储支持数据归档和降冷，长期存储成本低；\n可视化操作：一键配置，简化开发流程，无需编码工作；\n指定范围：可指定消费的起始位置，排除不需要的记录；\n消息聚合：可按分钟维度聚合消息记录，并支持修改时间粒度；\n自动化执行：云函数自动完成云消息队列 CKafka / TDMQ 的数据备份，中间过程无需任何人工操作；\n三、云消息队列介绍\n**消息队列 **CKafka （ Cloud Kafka ）是一个分布式、高吞吐量、高可扩展性的消息系统，100%兼容开源 Kafka API 0.9.0 至 2.8.0 版本。CKafka 基于发布订阅模式，通过消息解耦，使生产者和消费者异步交互，无需彼此等待。CKafka 具有数据压缩、支持离线和实时数据处理等优点，适用于日志压缩收集、监控数据聚合等场景。\n**消息队列 TDMQ **（ Tencent Distributed Message Queue ）是腾讯基于 Apache Pulsar 自研的一个云原生消息中间件系列，其中包含兼容 Pulsar 、RabbitMQ 、RocketMQ 等协议的消息队列子产品，得益于其底层计算与存储分离的架构，TDMQ 具备良好的弹性伸缩以及故障恢复能力。\n四、备份任务设置步骤\n这里以设置 CKafka 消息备份任务为例，TDMQ 设置与之相似：\n登录腾讯云 对象存储 COS 控制台。\n在左侧导航中，单击 [应用集成] ，找到 [ CKafka 消息备份] 。\n单击 [配置备份规则] ，进入规则配置页面。\n单击 [添加函数] 。注意：如果您尚未开通云函数服务，请前往 云函数控制台 开通云函数服务，按照提示完成服务授权即可。\n在弹出的窗口中，配置如下信息：\n\na.函数名称：作为函数的唯一标识名称，创建后不可修改（您可以在云函数控制台上查看该函数）。\nb.关联存储桶：存放 CKafka 消息的 COS 存储桶。\nc.时间粒度：根据消息量的大小，选取汇聚消息的时间间隔，时间间隔为 5 - 15 分钟不等。为保证转存性能，聚合文件数量与 Partition 数量、partition_max 设置数值有关。有关 Partition 的说明，请参见分区。\nd.SCF 授权：CKafka 消息备份需要授权云函数从您的 CKafka 服务中读取相关实例消息，并将消息转存至您指定的存储桶中。因此需要添加此授权。\n6.单击 [下一步] ，进行 CKafka 配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.实例选择：选择消息来源的 CKafka 实例，仅支持同地域的 CKafka 实例。\nb.主题选择：选择消息来源的主题。\nc.起始位置：消息转储备份时历史消息的处理方式，topic offset 设置。\nd.访问地址：必须为 VPC 内网访问地址，基础网络的 CKafka 实例请添加路由策略，具体请参考 添加路由策略。注意：对应的 VPC 子网中必须有可用的 IP ，且必须支持 DHCP 。\n7.单击 [下一步] ，进行投递配置，配置项说明如下：\n\na.投递的路径：备份文件的投递路径前缀，不填写则默认保存在存储桶根路径，指定前缀必须以斜杠 “ / ” 为结尾。\n8.添加配置后，单击 [确认] ，即可看到函数已添加完成。\n\n五、查看备份文件\n等待一段时间后，可以看到存储桶下投递了备份文件，其内容的每行代表一条消息记录。\n\n\n\n好了，本期关于云备份方案将分享到这里，欢迎点击“链接”，查看更多云消息队列备份攻略。",
