It's that entity/being that makes sure that your code does not function the same way in your local, development and production environments. Well, he's a gnome and is called Bob Stinkycode.\nI imagine he looks something like this after he's messed with you:\n\nLet's see an example: you've been working on a feature for a while, you've tested and everything works perfectly. Then the code is deployed to a real environment and some part of the feature that worked and had been tested extensively before does not work. You check and double check and crap, theoretically it should work, you can't explain why the hell it's failing... and of course your code is perfect and the only posible explanation is that the Bob has done it again, he is messing with your code...\nIt's a hard problem to solve, as Bob decides when to let the code work and when to mess with it. If you look for him you will not find him, he has 1000s of lines of code, 100s of folders and 10s of services and processes to hide... \nThe only solution is to accept it, and let him get tired, once he get's bored your code will work again... Don't waste your time trying to solve it xD \nAnother example: A user reports a bug, we have screenshots, reports in Sentry, and when we try replicating it, it never happens again. This is also Bob's fault.\n\nJokes aside, I think Bob is just a metaphor of the ego and/or pride of a developer. Sometimes it's easier to swallow, than to accept your code has flaws. I'm guilty of this, but try to always tell myself that bob is just uncertainty and ignorance about a bug. \nThat's it for me, hope you enjoyed the quick read. Do you have experience with Bob Stinkycode? How do you call him?\nGIF by tenor\n\nGIF 2 tenor",

          "description": "CI jobs typically execute in a freshly spun-up container, with no leftover state from previous runs. This helps ensure that builds are repeatable. However it can also make them much slower than they need to be. Each run has to repeat a lot of time-consuming setup work, such as downloading and installing tools, and cannot rely on work done by previous runs, as you would when running build commands iteratively on your desktop.\nTherefore most CI/CD providers offer a caching facility to speed up runs by selectively restoring state from previous runs. But because the details of your build workflows are opaque to the CI providers, they can only cache at a very coarse-grained level, and this limits how much benefit you can get from them.  Read on to see why!\nThese built-in caching facilities all …",

          "description": "前谷歌 CEO 将 AI 比作核武器\n\r\n前谷歌 CEO Eric Schmidt 将 AI 比作核武器，呼吁建立类似相互保证毁灭的威慑制度，防止世界最强大的国家率先发动攻击。在上个世纪的五六十年代，美国和苏联这两个超级大国最终达成了核武器试验条约，以防止核试验粉尘扩散。Schmidt 认为中美可能需要在 AI 领域达成类似的条约。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：VICE\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：或许有一天 AI 武器化，真的需要到了各个 AI 大国坐下来制定一些规则，但是目前这个论调显然是针对性的攻击而已。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n流行的 KDE 桌面停靠区 Latte Dock 停止开发\n\r\n在过去的几年里，Latte Dock 一直是 KDE Plasma 桌面上流行的类似 macOS 的桌面停靠区。它去年发布了 0.10。昨天，它的作者宣布已经结束了在这个项目上的工作，“我正在退出 Latte 的开发。主要是我没有时间、动力或兴趣了……我希望我能够发布 Latte v0.11，但不幸的是我做不到。”他也希望有其他开发者接手开发这个已经有 6 年之久的流行软件。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然很可惜，不过我想以开源社区的生命力，很快就会有人接手或出现它的复刻版。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n科技公司们倡议废除闰秒\n\r\n谷歌、微软、Meta 和亚马逊周一发起了一项旨在废除闰秒的公共行动，美国和法国计时当局已对此举表示赞同。1972 年以来，已经增加了 27 次闰秒。在增加闰秒时，23:59:59 的下一秒并非变成 00:00:00，而是会额外增加一个 23:59:60 的计时，也就是最后一分钟变成 61 秒。这就会给计算机造成很大的困扰，尤其是那些需要依赖精确的计时服务器的服务，它曾在 2012 年引发了 Reddit 的大规模宕机。谷歌率先提出了“闰秒弥补”的解决方案，即在一天的过程中以许多微小的步进来弥补闰秒的变化。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNET\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：1972 年制定闰秒政策时，并没有考虑当时刚刚开始的互联网服务，但是现在互联网已经空前强大，应该采取更好的解决闰秒问题的方法。",

          "description": "为角色扮演游戏的所有元素找到一个开源工具。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n我玩过很多桌面角色扮演游戏（RPG），无论是从频率还是种类来说。一般来说，我更喜欢和朋友一起玩 RPG，但在过去的 2 年里，我一直在玩网络游戏。（LCTT 校注：这里的 RPG 游戏指的是那种“传统”的面对面的桌面游戏，而非很多人最初接触的 RPG 电子游戏。）\n\r\n起初，我不确定如何在线长期的进行游戏。我知道有很多的工具可以实现，但直到我发现在线桌面游戏的开源世界之前，这些工具没有一个引起我的兴趣。通过一小部分开源应用程序，我已经能够在开源平台上进行我的所有游戏。\n\r\n这也是一年中的好时机，因为最近是 免费 RPG 日（LCTT 校注：今年的这个节日在 7 月 23 日举办）。在免费 RPG 日，桌面角色扮演游戏行业的发行商们会免费发放游戏，鼓励玩家尝试新游戏和新冒险。尽管它在 2020 年被取消了，但今年它又作为现场活动回归，并通过 Dungeon Crawl Classics 和 Paizo 的免费 RPG 示例下载提供了一些虚拟支持。\n\r\n如果这个活动提供的虚拟产品还不够，我还整理了一份 你可能尚未尝试过的 5 个开源桌面 RPG 游戏列表。\n\r\n当你准备好开始玩游戏时，请尝试其中一些开源工具，看看它们能在多大程度上增强你的游戏体验。\n\r\n聊天\n\r\n在线 RPG 游戏最基本的（从技术上讲，也是唯一的）要求是交流。这是游戏的媒介：玩家需要一种说话的途径。\n\r\n有几个不错的选择。我发现 Mumble 是对带宽需求最低的工具。这是一个纯语音聊天应用程序，可以使用非常高效的 Opus 编解码器让每个人一次交谈数小时而不会中断。\n\r\n\n\r\n它在世界各地都运行有公共实例，所以下载 Mumble 客户端后，你可以加入其中任何一个开放的实例，并使用它来在线运行游戏。有一个“按下通话”设置，你可以用此来消除背景噪音，当你的其…",

          "description": "我创建了 Linux nftwatch 命令来观察防火墙的流量统计。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNetfilter 表（nftables）是现代 Linux 发行版中的默认防火墙。它在 Fedora 和 RHEL 8、最新的 Debian 和许多其他版本上都有。它取代了早期发行版中捆绑的旧版 iptables。它是一个强大的、值得的 iptables 替代品，作为一个广泛使用它的人，我欣赏它的能力和功能。\n\r\nnftables 的一个特点是能够为许多元素添加计数器，例如规则。这些都是按需启用的。你需要使用 counter 参数，在每一行明确地要求它。我为我的防火墙中的特定规则启用了这些计数器，这使我能够看到这些规则。\n\r\n这让我开始思考。我怎样才能实时查看这些计数器？一开始我尝试了 watch，它允许诸如刷新率之类的东西，但我不喜欢默认格式，而且它不能滚动。我发现使用 head 和 tail 以及 awk 也不理想，并不存在一个用户友好的解决方案。所以我自己写了一个，我想与开源社区分享。\n\r\nLinux 上的 nftwatch 介绍\n\r\n我的解决方案，我称之为 nftwatch，做了几件事：\n\r\n\r\n它对 nftables 的输出进行重新排序和改写，使其更具有可读性。\n\r\n它允许向上或向下滚动输出。\n\r\n可以由用户定义的刷新率（可以实时改变）。\n\r\n它可以暂停显示。\n\r\n\r\n你得到的不是一个表格的转储，而是显示每个规则活动的输出。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以从它的 Git 仓库下载它。\n\r\n它是 100% 的 Python 代码，100% 的开源，100% 的免费。它满足了所有免费的高质量程序的要求。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 nftwatch\n\r\n以下是手动安装说明：\n\r\n\r\n克隆或从 git 仓库下载该项目。\n\r\n将 nftwatch.yml 复制到 /etc/nftwatch.yml。\n\r\n将 nftwatch 复制到 /usr/local/bin/nftwatch 并使用 chmod a+x 授予其可执行权限。\n\r\n使用 nftwatch，不带任何参数来运行它。\n\r\n参见 nftwatch -m 的手册。\n\r\n\r\n你也可以在没有 YAML 配置文件的情况下运行 nftwatch，在这种情况下它使用内置的默认值。\n\r\n使用\n\r\nnftwatch 命令显示 nftables 规则。大多数控制都是为此目的而设计的。\n\r\n箭头键和等效的 Vim 的按键控制滚动。使用 F 或 S 键来改变刷新速度。使用 P 键来暂停显示。\n\r\n运行 nftwatch -m 以获得完整的说明，以及交互式按键控制的列表。\n\r\n防火墙的新观点\n\r\n即使你花费了时间去配置防火墙，它也会显得晦涩难懂和模糊不清。除了从日志条目中推断指标外，很难判断你的防火墙实际看到的活动类型。 使用 nftwatch，你可以看到你的防火墙在工作，并且可以更好地了解你的网络每天需要处理的流量类型。\n\r\n（文内图片来自 Kenneth Aaron，CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/7/nftwatch-linux-firewall\n\r\n作者：Kenneth Aaron 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "openKylin 发布首个体验版，目标“每一行代码都自主创新”\n\r\n一个月前，openKylin 社区宣布成立“中国首个桌面操作系统根社区”，其旨在在开源、自愿、平等、协作的基础上，通过开源、开放的社区合作，构建桌面操作系统顶级开源社区。但当时并未发布正式可用的操作系统软件。昨天，他们发布了 openKylin 的首个体验版：openKylin 0.7。它是基于 Linux 5.15 内核和其他开源组件进行构建，目标是“每一行代码都自主创新”。其默认搭载 UKUI 3.1 桌面环境，支持 Wayland，支持 PC、平板双模式。openKylin 社区计划每年发布一个操作系统版本，并不定期推送更新。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：openKylin\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在我看来，是不是首个桌面操作系统根社区根本不重要，是不是能做到“每一行代码都自主创新”也不重要，能发布一个广受好评的桌面操作系统才是最重要的。另外一点，这个 0.7 版本号颇具开源软件传统美德。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nApache OpenOffice 发布了一个微不足道的更新\n\r\nApache OpenOffice 于 2011 年创建后，几乎停滞不前。从 OpenOffice.org 分支出来的 LibreOffice 已经成为主导性的开源办公套件，而捐给 Apache 软件基金会的 Apache OpenOffice 只是时不时发布一些安全更新和错误修改。今天它发布了 v4.1.13 版本，可以看的出来，这是最早发布于 2014 年的 4.1 版的第 13 个错误修订版本，几乎没有什么值得一提的新特性。都 2022 年了，Apache OpenOffice 还运行在 Java 8 32 位的底层上。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得 OpenOffice 都快成了 Apache 之耻了，何不放弃转而支持 LibreOffice 呢？难道自家的再破也是家当么？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英特尔提交了一行改进百倍的图形驱动补丁\n\r\n开源的英特尔 Mesa Vulkan 驱动并入了一个光线追踪的重点修复，产生“近 100 倍（不是开玩笑）的改进”。更为重要的是，这只是一行代码带来的大幅改进。这是最初编写代码时的一个简单疏忽，但由于这一疏忽，意味着性能的巨大损失，还好它现在被发现了，而且是在英特尔 Arc 图形卡出现在大众面前之前。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，官方驱动有时候也挺拉胯的。\n\r\n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\n谷歌 解雇 了报告“AI 具备自我意识”的 工程师，该工程师认为谷歌的 “LaMDA 已经形成了自我意识，表达了对死亡的担忧，对保护的渴望，并确信它能感受到快乐和悲伤等情绪。”\n\r\n在月初 暂时撤回 之后，微软 Office 还是即将于本周迎来 一项更新，以阻止在下载的文档上启用 VBA 宏。",

          "description": "月初我在特斯拉官网下单了一台2021年5月份出厂的二手长续航Model Y，这周终于提车了。\n之前我对特斯拉这个公司的印象还可以，比如严格遵守劳动法等，不过这次在官网购买二手车的经历让我觉得特斯拉至少二手车部门的一些流程是不规范的，甚至可能会侵犯购车者的权益，让我觉得无怪乎会发生“韩潮事件1”。\n本文和大家分享一下我的购车经历，其中有捡漏攻略和可能会被坑的点，希望对大家有帮助。\nQ：为什么要买官网二手？\n首先第一个好处是省钱，还能更快提到车，现在新车下单要预计20-24周才能提车（长续航Model Y 为例），而官网二手在下单成功后7个工作日以内就能拿到车。\n其次官网购买二手车会送一年整车质保，这个质保期是叠加在新车保质期上的，因此如果购买一年以内的官网二手车，会出现二手车整车质保期比新车还长的现象；不过三电质保没有送。那么在官网二手的价格没有比其他二手平台的价格贵太多的情况下，为了这一年质保也是很划算的。事实上在我下单那几天对比后发现，差不多车况的情况下，特斯拉官网二手的价格基本和第三方二手平台持平或略低。\n最后我喜欢玩房车，计划购买 Model Y 后在买个拖挂房车玩玩。海外版包括22年之前的国产版Model Y都是原车自带拖挂装置安装孔位以及拖挂房车通信线束的，车机上也有拖挂模式，在线束和房车连接时就会激活。然而22款的国产Model Y 取消了拖挂模式，安装孔位和线束虽然还在，但线束已经没有任何信号了。这样我别无选择只能购买21款Model Y。\n官网二手车的质保描述\n​\nQ：官网买二手还能捡漏？\n是的，官网二手虽然也是一口价的模式，联系客服也没法砍价，但在每天晚上 11点 到 11 点 05分左右都会下调一次价格，幅度在 1000-3000 元都有；在每天下午 3 点左右，官网还会对部分二手车进行涨价，一些一直没卖出的车在降价到一定幅度时会涨价到刚上架时到价格，然…",

          "description": "我非常贪恋睡眠，因为我每天都会做梦，并且第二天起来，我几乎都记得自己做了什么梦。无论是好梦、荒诞的梦、还是噩梦，我都会贪恋其中不愿意起床，它们仿佛短暂的解开了我的脚铐手链，让我飞了一会，飞到了一个和我的真实生活完全不一样的世界。\n如果我放任自己开始苏醒，真实生活里的点点滴滴，就会像早晨洗脸被拧开的水龙头的水一样，涌入大脑还泄流不止。一睁开眼睛就开始思考真实生活，真是一件悲伤的事。所以当我不得不起床之后，我总会尽我所能留住那种和现实脱节的感觉，能留多久是多久。能暂时不展开真实生活的点点面相，就暂时不展开。\n这种不展开的方式，于我而言就是阅读、纯粹的写作、或者看电影。阅读，是掉入另一个人的大脑去看 TA 写出来的世界；写作，是掉入自己的思想，内观自己的思绪世界；有时我也会一起床先看一部电影。电影，啊，电影，那就是另一个人的故事了，与我完全没有关系的陌生人的生活。这些都是逃离，让我暂时不必被真实生活的清单事项所淹没。\n也因此，我的生活在某个节点，被分割成了「之前」和「之后」，这个节点的划分，于我而言就是开微信：查收微信消息的那一刻，就代表着我被拉回现实，开始需要处理跟真实生活息息相关的消息、通知、事项。我上午从不开微信，一般看微信都是下午1点后了。当然，这种回归现实的方式，也是循序渐进式的：1点前后，我会第一次开微信，只是纯粹接收消息，确认无要紧之事后，又立刻关闭微信。直到下午3点我的微信才正式处于常开状态，表示我正式接受来自真实生活里清单事项的随时打扰，繁碎日常正式拉开序幕。\n我现在颇享受这种隔离时段式的生活节奏，3点之前专注创作，3点之后回归生活，「回归」这个词已经说明，我刻意与真实生活保持距离的个人态度。我的一天于是就这样拥有了两幅面孔：上午，是流离于真实生活的异想世界，下午，是落地于真实生活的现实世界。那晚上呢？\n晚上，是所有互联网产品必争的时段，也是人最情绪化，情感状态最饱满的时候。这个时刻，我又有了一种脱离真实生活的漂浮感，但它和上午的「脱离」还不太一样。上午的脱离感是我刻意营造的，晚上的脱离感则是浑然天成的。它是异想世界和真实生活经过漫长一天的交织、杂融、沉淀之后形成的，自带一种未经雕琢的生野感，能随时将你吞噬，将你包围，张力如此之强，让你无处遁型。所以，人才会多半选择在晚上谈情做爱，那种呼之欲出、溢都溢不住的原始本能，不仅是商家必争，也是艺术家必争。这个最容易飘的时段，我觉得也是最能体现我与自己是否真的自洽的时刻。你能多大程度上接受自己的各种情绪？允许它？放任它？还是压制它？抵制它？与晚上的相处，具有了一种哲学感：是什么？为什么？你想干什么？\n可惜，到现在我依然还在摸索与深夜的相处之道：「情绪那么饱满，你总不能浪费吧？」脑子里这个声音颇为强烈，总觉得我应该物尽其用。可每一天的晚上都不太一样，今晚如蜜糖般的度过方式，放在明天也许就是砒霜。何为物尽其用？更何况，多数时候，夜晚让我觉得自己过得失败而忙碌，怎么又是一个颗粒无收，或效果甚微的一天？所以我现在会想，或者，选择给夜晚注入理性哲思，本身就是一个错误，所以我才会屡战屡败，跟它过得如此拧巴。\n那不如，就让上午承担想象，下午承担事项，晚上它什么也别承担了。就如情绪，它最需要的也许就只是被看见。也别绞尽脑汁赋予它什么意义，哪有那么多事需要意义？\n所以，我总结出了什么吗？我享受我割裂的三段式生活节奏，我给「幻想」和「现实」各自独立的空间，并保证雨露均沾。至于晚上，我不为难它，它也不必为难我。三十后的「自处之道」，大抵如此。",

          "description": "近日，少数派首页出现了一篇名为《把握浏览器的「门面」：少数派作者们都在用什么启动页？》的文章。在文章中，几位作者分别介绍了自己喜欢的浏览器启动页插件，评论区也有很多读者分享了自己的解决方案。\n可以看出，关于浏览器 newtab 的花样确实很多。网址导航、todolist、番茄钟……各种玩法都很有趣。可我和大家的喜好偏偏相反，我特别钟情于纯空白页，讨厌 newtab 中出现任何元素。🌚\nChrome 浏览器的 newtab 在默认情况下，由早期的空白页不知道什么时候开始变成了 Google 搜索框：\n默认 chrome://newtab\n如果你想去掉这个搜索框，解决办法是在 Chrome 设置中把地址栏搜索引擎从 Google 改成其他。这时候你会发现， Google 搜索框确实是不见了，可 newtab 的内容又变成了 8 个历史记录中的网站，还关不掉。删掉以后又会出来新的 8 个网站。容易泄露隐私的同时，它给出的建议也不一定用得上……\n修改搜索引擎后的 chrome://newtab\n而 Edge 这边的情况更加离谱：\nEdge 不知是从哪里得来的设计灵感，newtab 变成了新闻股票大杂烩，用户挣 kuī 钱吃瓜两不误。可能是担心瓜的热度太高，造成吃瓜群众中暑，还贴心为你展示了天气信息。\n默认 edge://newtab\n好在 Edge 可以关闭这个 newtab 中大部分的内容，但最后还剩 bing 搜索框无法去除。左下角还有增值电信业务经营许可证号，真的是想逼死强迫症。🥲\n关闭内容展示后的 edge://newtab\n1.安装 Super Evil New Tab Redux\n为此我找到了「Super Evil New Tab Redux」这款 Chrome 插件，我的需求才得以解决。这款插件可以为 newtab 设置背景色，可以添加自定义 HTML、CSS、JS 代码。\nSuper Evil New Tab Redux 选项\n插件地址：Chrome 网上应用店\n插件接管 newtab 之后，默认背景是黑色的，建议修改 Background Color 为白色，或者设置 RGB 值为：255 255 255，这样你就会收获一个纯净的 newtab：\n\n2.修改源文件\n虽然 newtab 变纯净了，但还是有一点点不完美：由于 newtab 被第三方插件接管，因此新建标签页时，标签页左侧 favicon 从  Chrome 图标变成了插件图标，看上去有一些违和。这时我发现插件本身已经开源，可以简单修改一下文件就能达到最理想的效果。\n\n2.1 修改newtab.html文件\n下载源码并解压，打开 newtab.html文件。\n将第 6 行代码中的<title>New Tab</title>修改为：<title>新标签页</title>。\n2.2 修改插件 icons\n去网络中寻找 Chrome 图标，比如在 iconfont 网站中就可以搜到很多这样的图标。\niconfont\n选择一个你喜欢的图标，分别下载尺寸为 512、128、96、48、32、16 的 png 文件。打开插件源码中的「icons」文件夹，按照其中的文件命名规律，对刚刚下载的图标文件重新命名，替换原文件。\n替换后的 icons\nchrome://newtab 默认 favicon 是灰色的，我使用的是彩色 Chrome 图标，你也可以选择原风格的图标。\n2.3 修改 options.html 文件\n顺手对options.html进行简单的汉化，使用起来更加直观。\n\n3.载入修改版插件\n在 Chrome 中打开 chrome://extensions 页面，开启右上方的「开发者模式」。点击「加载已解压的扩展程序」，选取你刚才修改的 Super Evil New Tab Redux 源代码文件夹。此时经过修改后的插件就可以使用了。\n\n最终效果\n经过修改的 newtab 样式已经彻底融入了 Chrome，完全看不出一点违和感。\n修改后的 newtab 样式修改后的插件选项\n插件同样适用于所有 Chromium 内核浏览器，载入方法也是一样的。\nEdge 浏览器使用效果\nEdge 浏览器载入该插件后，彩色图标莫名其妙变成了黑白色，但是不影响使用。建议 Edge 用户在上文步骤 2.2 中搜索 Edge 图标进行替换。\nEdge：我生气了，哄不好的那种。🙃\n你还可以把修改后的插件进行备份，或者放进系统引导盘，让它成为你的装机必备。❤️",

          "description": "不知道从什么时候开始，拆解并装裱废弃的电子产品开始流行起来，甚至一些厂商也下场提供了官方的装裱服务。\n我收藏了两部诺基亚Lumia925，可惜其中一部已经不能开机了，尝试过刷机救砖也不行，便想着把它也装裱起来，当一个摆设继续发挥余热。\n看了下网上卖的模版有点千篇一律，而且价格也不便宜。看了几家店铺的介绍后，发现其实工序并不复杂，就打算自己试一下。开头先给大家分享一下我的装裱成果：\n\n个人还是比较满意的。相框是A4纸的尺寸，整体还是比较紧凑的，因为觉得太大了有点占地方，缺点就是参数不能写得太多，一些小的零件就放不下了，大家如果想要把全部零件都展示出来的话，相框可以选择大一点的。\n所需素材&价格：\n\n宜家相框（39元）\n铜版纸（4元）\n热熔胶（已有的）\n双面胶（已有的）\n手机拆机工具（已有的）\n旧手机（已有的）\n\n因为一些材料是之前就有的，所以整体花费是40多元，大头都在宜家的相框上了，网上应该能够买到同尺寸更便宜的。下面就分享一下具体的步骤。\n第一步：拆手机、零件归类\n搜索手机型号+拆机教程，就可以找到详细的拆机步骤。如果没有工具的话，网上很便宜就能买一套（其实老手机最需要的就是撬棒）。\n拆解的过程大家可以量力而行，把重要的部件拆下来就行，也不一定非要追求「芯片级」的拆解。\n拆解之后可以简单把零件归类、简单摆放一下，简单构思一下背景图纸的布局，看看有没有什么零件是可以舍弃的。\n\n第二步：设计、打印背景图片\n有了零件之后，就到了发挥大家创意的地方——设计背景图纸。我是用PS先建立了一个A4尺寸的背景，然后将网上查到的主要参数列了上去，因为A4纸空间有限，只分出了屏幕、背盖、电池、主板、摄像头、卡槽和其他组件几个模块。\n为了保证原汁原味，下图左上角的logo是我从当年的广告片里截取出来的；右上角的彩条是我根据当年Lumia经典的配色PS上去的，让整体色彩稍微多一些，要不然就太单调了。我把这个背景图纸传到网盘了（提取码：jvgg），大家看得上的话可以直接拿去用。\n\n设计好之后，如果家里有打印机的话，可以打出来看一下位置摆放是否合理，顺便看下字体的大小是否合适，再进行一些微调。\n不推荐直接用A4纸，太薄了撑不住零件。我去打印店咨询了一下更厚的纸张，店家给我推荐了300g的铜版纸，价格也不贵（A4尺寸2张4元）。大家想做的话，带着源文件直接找打印店就行。\n第三步：粘贴零件、安装相框\n准备好零件和背景图之后，最后一步就比较简单了。用热熔胶枪把零件都粘贴在背景图纸上，电池最好直接用双面胶，不要接触高温的热熔胶。粘好后清理掉热熔胶的「拉丝儿」，等上一段时间粘牢固。\n\n宜家的相框有三层，透明面板、中框、背部盖板，粘好零件的背景图纸放在中框和背部盖板之间就可以，如果松动的话，可以用胶水把背景图纸和背部盖板粘在一起。\n以上就是所有的步骤啦，虽然整体的精致程度不如网上的一些模版，但是自己动手把心爱的手机装裱起来，这种感觉还是很不一样的，如果你有废弃的旧手机也可以自己动手试试。\n\n（我拍了一只视频来记录整个过程，大家感兴趣的话也可以去看看）",

I don't need to use markup languages like HTML or Markdown to describe what a project does or how to compile it. But maintaining this documentation can be a pain. If I need to update the middle of a sentence in my Readme text file, I need to reformat the text so I don't end up with a really long or short line in the middle of my other text that's otherwise formatted to 75 columns.

Hollow and vase-like, the preserved works extend the vibrancy and supple forms of purple statice or burgundy kangaroo paw from approximately ten days to upwards of five years. More",

Working with a color palette of pastels and neutral tones, the Spanish artist (previously) paints large-scale portraits, fragments of limbs, and birds, often leaving the composition’s skeletal forms visible. “The supports are just as important as the work itself,” he tells Colossal. “I look for camouflage, minimalism, and mixture. In the end, it is also a metaphorical form of the footprint that I believe we should leave in the places we pass through.”\nMany of Taquen’s works consider the relationship between species through the lens of movement and impulse, focusing on gesture, touch, and instinctive acts.
