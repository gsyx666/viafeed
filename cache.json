UFO 测试无法通过, 与观感一样的定时卡顿. 然后又测试了 animation-time-graph, 与游戏时的帧率表现基本一致.\n\n打开 hwinfo64 观察发现 GPU 的温度正常, 频率和占用也都保持平稳没有异常. \n然后开始排查 CPU 的问题, 打开任务管理器发现有一个 System 进程稳定占用了 10%左右的 CPU\n\n进程详情如下\n\n内核相关的系统进程, 联想到可能与显卡驱动有关. 于是尝试重新安装了最新版的 nvidia 显卡驱动 516.94, 安装完重启后故障依旧. \n接着尝试回退显卡驱动. 回退到 516.40 后, 发现 System 进程 CPU 恢复正常, 卡顿也没有了, 很开心地玩了会儿游戏. 关机重启后, 这个 System 进程的占用又变高了, 还是和开头一样的卡顿.\n所以现在的情况是, 重装 516.40 版本驱动, 可以解决问题, 但是关机重启后又变成老样子. 想问问有没有老哥遇到过相同情况, 是如何解决的?\n\n补充一些信息:\n- 电脑是拯救者 R9000P 2021H 5800h + 3060 版本\n- 笔记本自带屏 165hz 和 Type-C 口外接屏 60hz 均有该问题\n- 笔记本 HDMI 有插一个显卡欺骗器用于串流, 实测插上与否对该问题似乎并无影响",

          "description": "When viewing the uncanny scenes of Munich-based artist Quint Buchholz, it’s evident that play, experimentation, and exploring the uncharted are central tenets of his practice: a string quintet precariously balances above the sea, sightseers take advantage of the view atop a giant man, and a pigeon doubles as an apartment complex.\nEach piece toys with scale and sensibility, and Buchholz enlarges some characters to preposterous sizes while positioning others in strange, seemingly impossible situations.

Many of the works feature an element of hidden sorcery, veiling the largely natural subject matter with mysteriously powerful energy.\nAlthough devoid of color, Carling’s drawings capture the trippy, psychedelic imaginations associated with the rock music that dominated the Sixties and Seventies and provided the soundtrack for his childhood home.
