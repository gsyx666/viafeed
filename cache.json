If you calculate the ratio here, you'll see that Magic is 234,000,000,000 times faster than a human being.\nTime is interesting.

I am convinced that every individual contributor arrives at the point of getting larger-than-oneself ideas and wanting to use the insight they accumulated through technical work to lead teams. \nFor years, management seemed a logical next step for a developer’s career, up to the point of a strongly-held belief that getting a manager’s title is a “promotion”. Only after having made an engineer-manager transition myself, I am confident this is false.\nWhen you are a manager, you stop being an active contributor or have to cut your workload and give up challenging tasks. Over time, you might discover your coding skills have deteriorated and realize you are behind on tech trends and best practices. \nA…",

It's that entity/being that makes sure that your code does not function the same way in your local, development and production environments. Well, he's a gnome and is called Bob Stinkycode.\nI imagine he looks something like this after he's messed with you:\n\nLet's see an example: you've been working on a feature for a while, you've tested and everything works perfectly. Then the code is deployed to a real environment and some part of the feature that worked and had been tested extensively before does not work. You check and double check and crap, theoretically it should work, you can't explain why the hell it's failing... and of course your code is perfect and the only posible explanation is that the Bob has done it again, he is messing with your code...\nIt's a hard problem to solve, as Bob decides when to let the code work and when to mess with it. If you look for him you will not find him, he has 1000s of lines of code, 100s of folders and 10s of services and processes to hide... \nThe only solution is to accept it, and let him get tired, once he get's bored your code will work again... Don't waste your time trying to solve it xD \nAnother example: A user reports a bug, we have screenshots, reports in Sentry, and when we try replicating it, it never happens again. This is also Bob's fault.\n\nJokes aside, I think Bob is just a metaphor of the ego and/or pride of a developer. Sometimes it's easier to swallow, than to accept your code has flaws. I'm guilty of this, but try to always tell myself that bob is just uncertainty and ignorance about a bug. \nThat's it for me, hope you enjoyed the quick read.

          "description": "It's only natural for us humans, to get distracted by literally anything other than what we should focus on.\nThe same can be said for reading articles.\nFor browsers there is a feature called reader mode, it removes all the distractions from the webpage so you can focus on the content itself.\n\nFor Chrome however, this is not yet a public feature, but you can enable it today!\nAnd i'll show you how you can do just that.\nOpen up your Google Chrome browser and in the address bar type the following link: chrome://flags.\nThis will open a page where you can control certain flags for your browser.\nIn the top search field search for: \"Enable Reader Mode\".\nYou'll notice a dropdown on the side of it, it should be set to default. Change this value to be enabled.\n\nAs soon as you change this value Chrome will ask you to relaunch your browser.\nNow that you have reader mode enabled, visit any article, for instance use the one you are on right now.\nIn the address bar you'll now notice this little symbol that looks like a newspapper.\n\nOnce you click it, it transform the webpage to a read only page.\nThank you for reading my blog.

          "description": "CI jobs typically execute in a freshly spun-up container, with no leftover state from previous runs. This helps ensure that builds are repeatable. However it can also make them much slower than they need to be. Each run has to repeat a lot of time-consuming setup work, such as downloading and installing tools, and cannot rely on work done by previous runs, as you would when running build commands iteratively on your desktop.\nTherefore most CI/CD providers offer a caching facility to speed up runs by selectively restoring state from previous runs. But because the details of your build workflows are opaque to the CI providers, they can only cache at a very coarse-grained level, and this limits how much benefit you can get from them.  Read on to see why!\nThese built-in caching facilities all …",

          "description": "最主要的是要精通 JavaScript，这样你就可以减少 ReactJS 之旅的复杂性。\n\r\n\r\nReact 是一个建立在 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript 之上的 UI 框架，其中 JavaScript（JS）负责大部分的逻辑。如果你对变量、数据类型、数组函数、回调、作用域、字符串方法、循环和其他 JS DOM 操作相关的主题有一定了解，这些将极大地加快学习 ReactJS 的步伐。\n\r\n你对现代 JavaScript 的概念将决定你能多快地掌握 ReactJS 的步伐。你不需要成为一个 JavaScript 专家来开始你的 ReactJS 之旅，但就像对食材的了解是任何希望掌握烹饪的厨师所必须的一样，学习 ReactJS 也是如此。它是一个现代的 JavaScript UI 库，所以你需要了解一些 JavaScript。问题是，需要多少？\n\r\n示例解释\n\r\n假设我被要求用英语写一篇关于“牛”的文章，但我对这种语言一无所知。在这种情况下，为了让我成功地完成任务，我不仅要对主题有概念，还要对指定的语言有概念。\n\r\n假设我获得了一些关于主题（牛）的知识，我如何计算我需要知道多少英语才能写出规定的主题？如果我必须用英语写一篇关于其他复杂话题的文章呢？\n\r\n这很难搞清楚，不是吗？我不知道我要写关于这个话题的什么东西，但它可能是任何东西。所以要想开始，我必须要有适当的英语知识，但还不止于此。\n\r\n极端现实\n\r\n在开始使用 ReactJS 之前，所需的 JavaScript 数量也是如此。根据我的例子情景，ReactJS 是话题“牛”，而 JavaScript 是英语。要想在 ReactJS 中获得成功，对 JavaScript 的掌握很重要。如果没有适当的 JavaScript 基础，一个人是很难专业地掌握 ReactJS 的。无论我对这个主题有多少知识，如果我不知道语言的基础，我就不能正确地表达自己。\n\r\n多少才算够？\n\r\n根据我的经验，当你开始你的 ReactJS 之旅时，你应该已经熟悉了：\n\r\n\r\n变量\n\r\n数据类型\n\r\n字符串方法\n\r\n循环\n\r\n条件式\n\r\n\r\n你应该对这些具体的 JavaScript 熟悉。但这些只是最基本的先决条件。当你试图创建一个简单的 React 应用时，你将不可避免地需要处理事件。所以，普通函数、函数表达式、语句、箭头函数的概念，箭头函数和普通函数的区别，以及这两类函数中 this 关键字的词义范围，这确实很重要。\n\r\n但问题是，如果我必须使用 ReactJS 创建一个复杂的应用怎么办？\n\r\n获得启发\n\r\n在 JavaScript 中处理事件、传播操作符、解构、命名导入和默认导入将帮助你理解 React 代码的工作机制。\n\r\n最重要的是，你必须了解 JavaScript 本身背后的核心概念。JavaScript 在设计上是异步的。当出现在文件底部的代码在文件顶部的代码之前执行时，不要惊讶。像 promise、callback、async-await、map、filter 和 reduce 这样的结构，是 ReactJS 中最常见的方法和概念，尤其是在开发复杂的应用时。\n\r\n最主要的是要精通 JavaScript，这样你可以减少 ReactJS 之旅的复杂性。\n\r\n越来越好\n\r\n我很容易说出你需要知道的东西，但你去学习它完全是另一回事。大量练习 JavaScript 是必不可少的，但你可能会感到惊讶，我认为这并不意味着你必须等到掌握它。有些概念事先很重要，但你可以在学习过程中学到很多东西。练习的一部分是学习，所以你可以开始使用 JavaScript，甚至是 React 的一些基础知识，只要你以舒适的速度移动并理解在你尝试任何严肃的事情之前做你的“家庭作业”是一个要求。\n\r\n立即开始使用 JavaScript\n\r\n不要费心等到你了解了 JavaScript 的所有方面。那永远不会发生。如果这样做，你将陷入学习 JavaScript 的永远循环中。你们都知道技术领域是如何不断发展和迅速变化的。如果你想开始学习 JavaScript，请尝试阅读 Mandy Kendall 的介绍性文章 通过编写猜谜游戏学习 JavaScript。这是一种快速入门的好方法，当你看到了可能的情况，我认为你可能会发现很难停下来。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/7/learn-javascript-before-reactjs\n\r\n作者：Sachin Samal 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Debian 会考虑在官方版本中添加非自由固件吗？如果他们想解决 Debian 开发人员重点提出的问题，这似乎是一种可能性。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n由于 Debian 的稳定性和新功能之间的平衡，它是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。\n\r\n此外，它不附带任何非自由固件。\n\r\n但是，对于想要在较新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已成为一个问题。\n\r\n大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件才能正常工作，其中包括 Wi-Fi、图形等。\n\r\n为了解决这个问题，Debian 开发人员、前 Debian 项目负责人 Steve McIntyre 已经积极讨论了一段时间。\n\r\n正如 Geeker's Digest 所发现的，在 DebConf 22 会议上，Steve 最近向用户和开发人员着重谈到了修复固件混乱这件事。\n\r\n在官方版本中包含非免费固件\n\r\n至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的非官方 Debian 镜像。\n\r\n然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”也不是用户更喜欢推荐的镜像的东西。\n\r\n此外，当用户可以选择 Ubuntu 或任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版作为替代方案时，期望用户安装非自由固件也是违反直觉的。\n\r\n不仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：\n\r\n\r\n维护单独的非自由镜像非常耗时。\n\r\n由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。\n\r\n\r\n如果我们希望更多用户在通用硬件上使用 Debian，Steve 建议尽早解决这个问题。\n\r\n可能会通过安装程序中的提示让用户安装非自由固件，类似于 Ubuntu 所做的。\n\r\n此外，在他在 DebConf 22 的演讲中，似乎大多数开发人员投票支持在官方 Debian 镜像中添加非自由固件。\n\r\n随着他重点提出这件事，Steve 得到了寻找解决这个问题的社区用户/开发人员的更多关注。\n\r\n简单/方便的出路：在官方发布的镜像中添加非自由固件。\n\r\n那么，Debian 最终会在其新版本中添加对非自由固件的支持吗？ Debian 12 会让这成为现实吗？\n\r\n在下面的评论中分享你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/debian-non-free/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "了解 Java 中的内存管理。\n\r\n\r\n用 C 或 C++ 这样的编程语言写一个应用时，需要编写代码来销毁内存中不再需要的对象。当应用程序扩展得越来越复杂时，未使用对象被忽略释放的可能性就越大。这会导致内存泄露，最终内存耗尽，在某个时刻将没有更多的内存可以分配。结果就是应用程序运行失败并出现 OutOfMemoryError 错误。但在 Java 中，垃圾收集器Garbage Collection（GC）会在程序执行过程中自动运行，减轻了手动分配内存和可能的内存泄漏的任务。\n\r\n垃圾收集器并不只有一种，Java 虚拟机（JVM）有七种不同的垃圾收集器，了解每种垃圾收集器的目的和优点是很有用的。\n\r\n1、Serial 收集器\n\r\n\n\r\n垃圾收集器的原始实现，使用单线程。当垃圾收集器运行时，会停止应用程序（通常称为“stop the world”事件）。适用于能够承受短暂停顿的应用程序。该垃圾收集器占用内存空间比较小，因此这是嵌入式应用程序的首选垃圾收集器类型。在运行时使用以下命令启用该垃圾收集器：\n\r\n$ java -XX:+UseSerialGC\r\n\n\r\n2、Parallel 收集器\n\r\n\n\r\n像 Serial 收集器一样，Parallel 收集器也使用“stop the world”方法。这意味着，当垃圾收集器运行时，应用程序线程会停止。但是不同的是，Parallel 收集器运行时有多个线程执行垃圾收集操作。这种类型的垃圾收集器适用于在多线程和多处理器环境中运行中到大型数据集的应用程序。\n\r\n这是 JVM 中的默认垃圾收集器，也被称为吞吐量收集器。使用该垃圾收集器时可以通过使用各种合适的 JVM 参数进行调优，例如吞吐量、暂停时间、线程数和内存占用。如下：\n\r\n\r\n线程数：-XXarallelGCThreads=<N>\n\r\n暂停时间：-XX:MaxGCPauseMilli…",

          "description": "我创建了 Linux nftwatch 命令来观察防火墙的流量统计。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNetfilter 表（nftables）是现代 Linux 发行版中的默认防火墙。它在 Fedora 和 RHEL 8、最新的 Debian 和许多其他版本上都有。它取代了早期发行版中捆绑的旧版 iptables。它是一个强大的、值得的 iptables 替代品，作为一个广泛使用它的人，我欣赏它的能力和功能。\n\r\nnftables 的一个特点是能够为许多元素添加计数器，例如规则。这些都是按需启用的。你需要使用 counter 参数，在每一行明确地要求它。我为我的防火墙中的特定规则启用了这些计数器，这使我能够看到这些规则。\n\r\n这让我开始思考。我怎样才能实时查看这些计数器？一开始我尝试了 watch，它允许诸如刷新率之类的东西，但我不喜欢默认格式，而且它不能滚动。我发现使用 head 和 tail 以及 awk 也不理想，并不存在一个用户友好的解决方案。所以我自己写了一个，我想与开源社区分享。\n\r\nLinux 上的 nftwatch 介绍\n\r\n我的解决方案，我称之为 nftwatch，做了几件事：\n\r\n\r\n它对 nftables 的输出进行重新排序和改写，使其更具有可读性。\n\r\n它允许向上或向下滚动输出。\n\r\n可以由用户定义的刷新率（可以实时改变）。\n\r\n它可以暂停显示。\n\r\n\r\n你得到的不是一个表格的转储，而是显示每个规则活动的输出。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以从它的 Git 仓库下载它。\n\r\n它是 100% 的 Python 代码，100% 的开源，100% 的免费。它满足了所有免费的高质量程序的要求。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 nftwatch\n\r\n以下是手动安装说明：\n\r\n\r\n克隆或从 git 仓库下载该项目。\n\r\n将 nftwatch.yml 复制到 /etc/nftwatch.yml。\n\r\n将 nftwatch 复制到 /usr/local/bin/nftwatch 并使用 chmod a+x 授予其可执行权限。\n\r\n使用 nftwatch，不带任何参数来运行它。\n\r\n参见 nftwatch -m 的手册。\n\r\n\r\n你也可以在没有 YAML 配置文件的情况下运行 nftwatch，在这种情况下它使用内置的默认值。\n\r\n使用\n\r\nnftwatch 命令显示 nftables 规则。大多数控制都是为此目的而设计的。\n\r\n箭头键和等效的 Vim 的按键控制滚动。使用 F 或 S 键来改变刷新速度。使用 P 键来暂停显示。\n\r\n运行 nftwatch -m 以获得完整的说明，以及交互式按键控制的列表。\n\r\n防火墙的新观点\n\r\n即使你花费了时间去配置防火墙，它也会显得晦涩难懂和模糊不清。除了从日志条目中推断指标外，很难判断你的防火墙实际看到的活动类型。 使用 nftwatch，你可以看到你的防火墙在工作，并且可以更好地了解你的网络每天需要处理的流量类型。\n\r\n（文内图片来自 Kenneth Aaron，CC BY-SA 4.0）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/7/nftwatch-linux-firewall\n\r\n作者：Kenneth Aaron 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "我非常贪恋睡眠，因为我每天都会做梦，并且第二天起来，我几乎都记得自己做了什么梦。无论是好梦、荒诞的梦、还是噩梦，我都会贪恋其中不愿意起床，它们仿佛短暂的解开了我的脚铐手链，让我飞了一会，飞到了一个和我的真实生活完全不一样的世界。\n如果我放任自己开始苏醒，真实生活里的点点滴滴，就会像早晨洗脸被拧开的水龙头的水一样，涌入大脑还泄流不止。一睁开眼睛就开始思考真实生活，真是一件悲伤的事。所以当我不得不起床之后，我总会尽我所能留住那种和现实脱节的感觉，能留多久是多久。能暂时不展开真实生活的点点面相，就暂时不展开。\n这种不展开的方式，于我而言就是阅读、纯粹的写作、或者看电影。阅读，是掉入另一个人的大脑去看 TA 写出来的世界；写作，是掉入自己的思想，内观自己的思绪世界；有时我也会一起床先看一部电影。电影，啊，电影，那就是另一个人的故事了，与我完全没有关系的陌生人的生活。这些都是逃离，让我暂时不必被真实生活的清单事项所淹没。\n也因此，我的生活在某个节点，被分割成了「之前」和「之后」，这个节点的划分，于我而言就是开微信：查收微信消息的那一刻，就代表着我被拉回现实，开始需要处理跟真实生活息息相关的消息、通知、事项。我上午从不开微信，一般看微信都是下午1点后了。当然，这种回归现实的方式，也是循序渐进式的：1点前后，我会第一次开微信，只是纯粹接收消息，确认无要紧之事后，又立刻关闭微信。直到下午3点我的微信才正式处于常开状态，表示我正式接受来自真实生活里清单事项的随时打扰，繁碎日常正式拉开序幕。\n我现在颇享受这种隔离时段式的生活节奏，3点之前专注创作，3点之后回归生活，「回归」这个词已经说明，我刻意与真实生活保持距离的个人态度。我的一天于是就这样拥有了两幅面孔：上午，是流离于真实生活的异想世界，下午，是落地于真实生活的现实世界。那晚上呢？\n晚上，是所有互联网产品必争的时段，也是人最情绪化，情感状态最饱满的时候。这个时刻，我又有了一种脱离真实生活的漂浮感，但它和上午的「脱离」还不太一样。上午的脱离感是我刻意营造的，晚上的脱离感则是浑然天成的。它是异想世界和真实生活经过漫长一天的交织、杂融、沉淀之后形成的，自带一种未经雕琢的生野感，能随时将你吞噬，将你包围，张力如此之强，让你无处遁型。所以，人才会多半选择在晚上谈情做爱，那种呼之欲出、溢都溢不住的原始本能，不仅是商家必争，也是艺术家必争。这个最容易飘的时段，我觉得也是最能体现我与自己是否真的自洽的时刻。你能多大程度上接受自己的各种情绪？允许它？放任它？还是压制它？抵制它？与晚上的相处，具有了一种哲学感：是什么？为什么？你想干什么？\n可惜，到现在我依然还在摸索与深夜的相处之道：「情绪那么饱满，你总不能浪费吧？」脑子里这个声音颇为强烈，总觉得我应该物尽其用。可每一天的晚上都不太一样，今晚如蜜糖般的度过方式，放在明天也许就是砒霜。何为物尽其用？更何况，多数时候，夜晚让我觉得自己过得失败而忙碌，怎么又是一个颗粒无收，或效果甚微的一天？所以我现在会想，或者，选择给夜晚注入理性哲思，本身就是一个错误，所以我才会屡战屡败，跟它过得如此拧巴。\n那不如，就让上午承担想象，下午承担事项，晚上它什么也别承担了。就如情绪，它最需要的也许就只是被看见。也别绞尽脑汁赋予它什么意义，哪有那么多事需要意义？\n所以，我总结出了什么吗？我享受我割裂的三段式生活节奏，我给「幻想」和「现实」各自独立的空间，并保证雨露均沾。至于晚上，我不为难它，它也不必为难我。三十后的「自处之道」，大抵如此。",

          "description": "近日，少数派首页出现了一篇名为《把握浏览器的「门面」：少数派作者们都在用什么启动页？》的文章。在文章中，几位作者分别介绍了自己喜欢的浏览器启动页插件，评论区也有很多读者分享了自己的解决方案。\n可以看出，关于浏览器 newtab 的花样确实很多。网址导航、todolist、番茄钟……各种玩法都很有趣。可我和大家的喜好偏偏相反，我特别钟情于纯空白页，讨厌 newtab 中出现任何元素。🌚\nChrome 浏览器的 newtab 在默认情况下，由早期的空白页不知道什么时候开始变成了 Google 搜索框：\n默认 chrome://newtab\n如果你想去掉这个搜索框，解决办法是在 Chrome 设置中把地址栏搜索引擎从 Google 改成其他。这时候你会发现， Google 搜索框确实是不见了，可 newtab 的内容又变成了 8 个历史记录中的网站，还关不掉。删掉以后又会出来新的 8 个网站。容易泄露隐私的同时，它给出的建议也不一定用得上……\n修改搜索引擎后的 chrome://newtab\n而 Edge 这边的情况更加离谱：\nEdge 不知是从哪里得来的设计灵感，newtab 变成了新闻股票大杂烩，用户挣 kuī 钱吃瓜两不误。可能是担心瓜的热度太高，造成吃瓜群众中暑，还贴心为你展示了天气信息。\n默认 edge://newtab\n好在 Edge 可以关闭这个 newtab 中大部分的内容，但最后还剩 bing 搜索框无法去除。左下角还有增值电信业务经营许可证号，真的是想逼死强迫症。🥲\n关闭内容展示后的 edge://newtab\n1.安装 Super Evil New Tab Redux\n为此我找到了「Super Evil New Tab Redux」这款 Chrome 插件，我的需求才得以解决。这款插件可以为 newtab 设置背景色，可以添加自定义 HTML、CSS、JS 代码。\nSuper Evil New Tab Redux 选项\n插件地址：Chrome 网上应用店\n插件接管 newtab 之后，默认背景是黑色的，建议修改 Background Color 为白色，或者设置 RGB 值为：255 255 255，这样你就会收获一个纯净的 newtab：\n\n2.修改源文件\n虽然 newtab 变纯净了，但还是有一点点不完美：由于 newtab 被第三方插件接管，因此新建标签页时，标签页左侧 favicon 从  Chrome 图标变成了插件图标，看上去有一些违和。这时我发现插件本身已经开源，可以简单修改一下文件就能达到最理想的效果。\n\n2.1 修改newtab.html文件\n下载源码并解压，打开 newtab.html文件。\n将第 6 行代码中的<title>New Tab</title>修改为：<title>新标签页</title>。\n2.2 修改插件 icons\n去网络中寻找 Chrome 图标，比如在 iconfont 网站中就可以搜到很多这样的图标。\niconfont\n选择一个你喜欢的图标，分别下载尺寸为 512、128、96、48、32、16 的 png 文件。打开插件源码中的「icons」文件夹，按照其中的文件命名规律，对刚刚下载的图标文件重新命名，替换原文件。\n替换后的 icons\nchrome://newtab 默认 favicon 是灰色的，我使用的是彩色 Chrome 图标，你也可以选择原风格的图标。\n2.3 修改 options.html 文件\n顺手对options.html进行简单的汉化，使用起来更加直观。\n\n3.载入修改版插件\n在 Chrome 中打开 chrome://extensions 页面，开启右上方的「开发者模式」。点击「加载已解压的扩展程序」，选取你刚才修改的 Super Evil New Tab Redux 源代码文件夹。此时经过修改后的插件就可以使用了。\n\n最终效果\n经过修改的 newtab 样式已经彻底融入了 Chrome，完全看不出一点违和感。\n修改后的 newtab 样式修改后的插件选项\n插件同样适用于所有 Chromium 内核浏览器，载入方法也是一样的。\nEdge 浏览器使用效果\nEdge 浏览器载入该插件后，彩色图标莫名其妙变成了黑白色，但是不影响使用。建议 Edge 用户在上文步骤 2.2 中搜索 Edge 图标进行替换。\nEdge：我生气了，哄不好的那种。🙃\n你还可以把修改后的插件进行备份，或者放进系统引导盘，让它成为你的装机必备。❤️",

          "description": "不知道从什么时候开始，拆解并装裱废弃的电子产品开始流行起来，甚至一些厂商也下场提供了官方的装裱服务。\n我收藏了两部诺基亚Lumia925，可惜其中一部已经不能开机了，尝试过刷机救砖也不行，便想着把它也装裱起来，当一个摆设继续发挥余热。\n看了下网上卖的模版有点千篇一律，而且价格也不便宜。看了几家店铺的介绍后，发现其实工序并不复杂，就打算自己试一下。开头先给大家分享一下我的装裱成果：\n\n个人还是比较满意的。相框是A4纸的尺寸，整体还是比较紧凑的，因为觉得太大了有点占地方，缺点就是参数不能写得太多，一些小的零件就放不下了，大家如果想要把全部零件都展示出来的话，相框可以选择大一点的。\n所需素材&价格：\n\n宜家相框（39元）\n铜版纸（4元）\n热熔胶（已有的）\n双面胶（已有的）\n手机拆机工具（已有的）\n旧手机（已有的）\n\n因为一些材料是之前就有的，所以整体花费是40多元，大头都在宜家的相框上了，网上应该能够买到同尺寸更便宜的。下面就分享一下具体的步骤。\n第一步：拆手机、零件归类\n搜索手机型号+拆机教程，就可以找到详细的拆机步骤。如果没有工具的话，网上很便宜就能买一套（其实老手机最需要的就是撬棒）。\n拆解的过程大家可以量力而行，把重要的部件拆下来就行，也不一定非要追求「芯片级」的拆解。\n拆解之后可以简单把零件归类、简单摆放一下，简单构思一下背景图纸的布局，看看有没有什么零件是可以舍弃的。\n\n第二步：设计、打印背景图片\n有了零件之后，就到了发挥大家创意的地方——设计背景图纸。我是用PS先建立了一个A4尺寸的背景，然后将网上查到的主要参数列了上去，因为A4纸空间有限，只分出了屏幕、背盖、电池、主板、摄像头、卡槽和其他组件几个模块。\n为了保证原汁原味，下图左上角的logo是我从当年的广告片里截取出来的；右上角的彩条是我根据当年Lumia经典的配色PS上去的，让整体色彩稍微多一些，要不然就太单调了。我把这个背景图纸传到网盘了（提取码：jvgg），大家看得上的话可以直接拿去用。\n\n设计好之后，如果家里有打印机的话，可以打出来看一下位置摆放是否合理，顺便看下字体的大小是否合适，再进行一些微调。\n不推荐直接用A4纸，太薄了撑不住零件。我去打印店咨询了一下更厚的纸张，店家给我推荐了300g的铜版纸，价格也不贵（A4尺寸2张4元）。大家想做的话，带着源文件直接找打印店就行。\n第三步：粘贴零件、安装相框\n准备好零件和背景图之后，最后一步就比较简单了。用热熔胶枪把零件都粘贴在背景图纸上，电池最好直接用双面胶，不要接触高温的热熔胶。粘好后清理掉热熔胶的「拉丝儿」，等上一段时间粘牢固。\n\n宜家的相框有三层，透明面板、中框、背部盖板，粘好零件的背景图纸放在中框和背部盖板之间就可以，如果松动的话，可以用胶水把背景图纸和背部盖板粘在一起。\n以上就是所有的步骤啦，虽然整体的精致程度不如网上的一些模版，但是自己动手把心爱的手机装裱起来，这种感觉还是很不一样的，如果你有废弃的旧手机也可以自己动手试试。\n\n（我拍了一只视频来记录整个过程，大家感兴趣的话也可以去看看）",

          "description": "sillydaddy: \n今天用 Qt(做跨平台桌面 UI 的一个大而臃肿的库，自带一个 IDE 工具)编译一个项目，它的 IDE 允许自定义一些编译的前置步骤，所以我想在编译前，拷贝一些库文件到指定的目录。我观察到了它自带的步骤里面有用到%{buildDir}这样的环境变量，于是很自然的我想知道库文件的目录应该用什么环境变量来表示。\n可我找不到一点提示的线索。上网搜索一番，发现不止我有这个疑问： https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35970727/use-of-variables-like-builddir-in-qtcreator-kit-settings-in-qt5\n我很郁闷，为什么这个 IDE 的开发者，就认为我一定会知道他所设置的「变态的」环境变量名称是什么呢？\n不止 Qt 有这个问题，包括 VisualStudio 在内，很多 IDE 都是这样的。可是做一个提示很难吗？ ContextMenu 这个思路就很好啊，右键点击一下，我就知道了我在这里可以做什么操作。那我在自定义前置步骤的时候，肯定会用到环境变量啊，为什么不能在旁边给一个提示按钮，让我可以浏览可能的环境变量呢？\n相似的例子，还有编译器不知所云让人抓狂的报错！\n相似的例子，还有 web 端的各种脚手架工具！\n相似的例子，还有。。。留给大家举例吧。\n对比之下，今天我还用到了一个命令：git rebase --interactive 。它虽然是命令行形式的，可它的文本提示写的很清楚，pick 、squash 、fixup...分别代表什么，直接在你要作修改的地方列出来了。带 GUI 的连这个也比不过，说不过去。\n虽说这些都是给程序员用的工具，但————\n一个程序员首先是一个人！！！ \nProgrammers' experience matters!!!\n纯属吐槽，但我有怒气！",

Well, what good is the toolchain if you won’t be using it to get more hands-on with Rust? Learning any language involves reading existing code and writing a lot of sample programs. That's a good way to become proficient in a language. However, there's a third way: debugging code.\nLearning through debugging involves trying to compile a pre-written (buggy) sample program, understanding the errors generated by the compiler, fixing the sample code, and then re-compiling it. Repeat that process until the code successfully compiles and runs.\nRustlings is an open source project by the Rust…",

The forecast comes as Sony revealed it shipped 2.4 million PlayStation 5 consoles in its recent quarter, up only 4 percent from the 2.3 million shipped during the same period last year. PS5 lifetime shipments have now reached 21.7 million.\nWhile hardware sales are slightly up year over year, software sales have plummeted 26 percent. In an investor call, Sony blamed the game slump on a lack of big PlayStation titles this year compared to 2021 and less time spent playing games in general — backed up by monthly active PlayStation Network users dropping 3 percent to 102 million.

Starting this week, you can stream the video feed from all your Nest cameras and video doorbells to your TV using a Chromecast with Google TV. Google announced the feature in a blog post on the Google Nest Community forum Wednesday morning. \n“What?” You ask. “Couldn’t you already do this?” Well, yes and no. It was possible to view the video feed from older Nest cameras — such as the Google Nest Doorbell (wired), the now discontinued Nest Cams, and the camera inside the Nest Hub Max — on the biggest screen in your home. \nBut, as I noted in my review of the new Nest Cam (indoor, wired), none of Google’s newer cameras could stream to Chromecast devices.

Working with a color palette of pastels and neutral tones, the Spanish artist (previously) paints large-scale portraits, fragments of limbs, and birds, often leaving the composition’s skeletal forms visible. “The supports are just as important as the work itself,” he tells Colossal. “I look for camouflage, minimalism, and mixture. In the end, it is also a metaphorical form of the footprint that I believe we should leave in the places we pass through.”\nMany of Taquen’s works consider the relationship between species through the lens of movement and impulse, focusing on gesture, touch, and instinctive acts.

The sculptural works are comprised of sprawling webs that appear like both root and vein systems, with flowers and more dense, fleshy patches emerging from an arm or torso. Each piece fuses the physical and mental, Jokinen says, sharing that her “approach is focused on everyday feelings, situations, and thoughts we all have.”\nThe mesh works are created from flax—Jokinen employs a technique similar to that used for handmade paper—that she dyes and molds into branches, twigs, and other organic forms.
