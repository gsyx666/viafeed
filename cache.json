In Ruby, we use destructuring to conveniently extract multiple values from data stored in Arrays or Hashes. It provides a way for us to group or ungroup data and assign them to variables where needed. \nIn this article we’re going to discuss destructuring for assignments, arrays and keyword args. We’ll also touch on why you would utilize destructuring.\nThe most straightforward form of destructuring is through multiple assignments. This form of destructuring assigns the variables on the left to the values on the right in the order that they are provided. \nAs an example:\na, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n\na => 1 \nb => 2 \nc => 3 \n\nIn the above example the variables on the left are assigned to the values on the right…",

          "description": "Software development principles are a must-know for all software engineers that aim to achieve clean codes. Software evolves with time as new features are required, so it is necessary to build a maintainable, reliable and sustainable code.\nSOLID principles are five basic principles for object-oriented programming design. They are set of rules to follow when designing a class structured software. These principles puts maintainability and extensibility into consideration as software evolves.\nSOLID STANDS FOR :\nS — SINGLE-RESPONSILITY PRINCIPLE\nO — OPEN-CLOSED PRINCIPLE\nL — LISTOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE\nI — INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE\nD — DEPENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE\nThe SOLID principles were first introduced by the famous Computer Scientist Robert J.

          "description": "THE BEST TWO WAYS TO SECURED YOUR WEB APP:\nValidate User Inputs:\nAccordingly, Injection-based attacks can come in so many ways; XSS, SQL injections, host header injection, and OS command injection are a few examples of these attacks.\nTherefore, Injection-based attacks have over the years made their way into the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and SANS Top 25 CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) many times.\nSo, in the web development, we need to validate all inputs before the application processes the data to mitigate injection-based attacks.\nE.g., the phone number field, Password field, Name field, they must only accept an acceptable format with specific numeric and special characters.\nManaging Application Secrets:\nfor example, You can use environment variables within the operating system to store this sensitive information, and we can use Node.js to call these environment variables.\nHowever, there are instances where the application would require more than one variable instantiated. At this juncture, the only best way to manage secrets is to use the dotenv package.\nso, you can easily install it using npm or Yarn as follows:\nnpm install dotenv\nyarn add dotenv\nThen, create a .env file at the project root and define all the secrets in that file.\nNODE_ENV= develpment,\nMONGODB_URL = \"mongodb_url:uerbsf@kgeyfdop_jhf\"\nPORT = 3000\nUSERNAME=secret123\nPASSWORD=secret123@\n\nFinally, you can require and use these secrets in the application like below:\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nmongoose.connect({\nhost: process.env.PORT,\nusername: process.env.MONGODB_URL,\npassword: process.env.PASSWORD\n})\n\nMost importantly, make sure to include .env files in the .gitignore file to prevent them from being pushed to the Git repository.",

          "description": "GNOME 正计划通知用户其固件安全状态，来保护不安全的硬件。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当你在支持 UEFI 的电脑上安装 Linux 时，你必须禁用“安全启动Secure Boot”，因为启用该选项后，不能使用现场 USBLive USB 启动。\n\r\n一些主流的 Linux 发行版支持安全启动，但对于许多其他发行版（以及板载的 Nvidia 硬件）来说，它的设置仍然具有挑战性。\n\r\n虽然一年又一年，情况似乎并没有改善，但总的来说，安全启动是一个必不可少的保护功能。\n\r\n因此，正如 Phoronix 所发现的，为了方便和让用户意识到这一点，GNOME 和红帽的开发者正在努力在安全启动被禁用时通知（或警告）用户。\n\r\n它有什么用？\n\r\nUEFI/安全启动被批评为 DRM，因为它剥夺了用户的自由。开源社区的许多人仍然不赞同实施 UEFI/安全启动和 TPM，因为它带来了不便。这就催生了像 Coreboot 这样的项目在开源世界中蓬勃发展。\n\r\n当然，如果你每天都用 Linux，我会建议你购买支持 Coreboot 的新硬件，这是一个不同的故事。\n\r\n话虽如此，但可以肯定的是，安全启动是最简单的方法。\n\r\n考虑到捆绑的专有固件，安全启动的安全性仍然值得商榷。但是，它是一个确保系统的固件安全的基本保护机制。\n\r\n所以，开发者准备在启动闪屏（Plymouth）、GNOME 显示管理器（GDM）和 GNOME 控制中心显示警告。\n\r\n\n\r\nGNOME 的一位开发者在 博客文章 中分享了它的更多细节，同时给出了其中的一些屏幕截图。\n\r\n\n\r\n一位来自红帽的开发者在 合并请求 中提到。\n\r\n\r\n安全启动被用来对付一些恶意软件试图感染系统的固件的安全威胁。用户可能会无意中禁用或软件可能会有意禁用安全启动。因此，配置不正确的话，系统就运行在一个不安全的平台上。如果启动闪屏能向用户提供一个警告，用户可以重新启动并重新配置他们的系统，或者立即寻求帮助。\n\r\n\r\n所以，作为一个 GNOME 用户，当它进入 GNOME 43 的最终版本或任何未来的版本时，我乐于看到它所带来的变化。\n\r\n如果你也想看看，你可以在 GNOME 控制中心的“隐私Privacy”标签下的“设备安全Device Security”部分找到这个选项，如下图所示，我的机器在 Arch Linux 上运行 GNOME 43 alpha。\n\r\n\n\r\n该菜单还可以显示 TPM、英特尔 BootGuard 和 IOMMU 保护的细节。\n\r\n\n\r\n看来我的系统并不像我想象的那么安全……但也许这就是这个功能的意义所在？\n\r\n如果你只在你的 Linux 发行版上使用 UEFI 模式，并且为了方便而关闭了安全保护功能，这能让你意识到这一点吗？\n\r\n有可能。但是，看看 Linux 发行版的状况和启用安全启动的问题。我不觉得这可能会是一个大问题。我们很快就会知道了。\n\r\n如何禁用这个警告？\n\r\n正如在 GNOME Gitlab 的 合并请求 中提到的，在你的内核参数中添加 sb-check=false 就可以禁用这些警告。\n\r\n不过，作为终端用户，你不需要担心这个问题。\n\r\n你对即将在 GNOME 43 或更高版本中增加的这个功能有什么看法？你对 UEFI/安全启动有什么看法？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/gnome-secure-boot-warning/\n\r\n作者：Anuj Sharma 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Linus 在 Macbook 上发布了 Linux 内核 5.19\n\r\n今天，Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 5.19，在对新硬件方面添加了对龙芯 CPU 和 Zen 4 CPU 的支持，支持 Zstd 压缩固件，并进一步改进了性能。有趣的是，Linux 表示，这次 5.19 的发布工作是在他的苹果 MacBook 笔记本上完成的，这台笔记本运行了 Asahi Linux 为苹果 M1 Macbook 打造的 Linux 系统。Linus 说，“这是我个人期待了很久的事情，而现在终于变成了现实。”在很早之前他曾在 PPC970 设备上为 PowerPC 进行过开发，这是他第三次使用苹果硬件用于 Linux 开发。他说，“但现阶段我并没有将 MacBook Air 用于任何真实工作，我只是将其用于版本测试、启动以及现在的版本发布。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：果然 Linus 对 Asahi Linux 的工作非常满意，我寻思我也是不是把我的 M1 Macbook 换成 Asahi Linux。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nLinux 内核不过 520\n\r\n被称为 Linux 5.20 的开发中的内核很可能会被称为 Linux 6.0。根据 Linus Torvalds 对现代版本的划分，Linux 又到了采用下一个主要版本号的时候。他对主要版本的提升通常会在小版本更新到 19 或 20 时进行。Linux 3.19 之后是 Linux 4.0，Linux 4.20 之后是 Linux 5.0。在周日的 Linux 5.19 公告中，Linus 表示“我可能会叫它 6.0，因为我开始担心再次被大数字所迷惑”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Linux 内核的大版本号其实没什么特别的，就是一个进位而已，你就当成内核版本号采用的是 20 进制好了。有时候可能还忘记进位了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPython 开发者讨论从邮件列表转移到论坛\n\r\nPython 项目在 2018 年开始实验使用论坛交流，作为实验的一部分，Python 核心开发者使用的邮件列表 python-committers 切换到了 Discourse 论坛。今天该邮件列表仍然存在，但主要作为发布公告使用，大部分讨论都是在论坛上进行的。一位开发者称，他不怎么访问 Discourse 而错过了有兴趣的新 PEP 讨论，希望新 PEP 能发布在 python-dev 邮件列表上。这个提议引发了讨论。最终，Python 语言指导委员会表示要将讨论的媒介切换到 Discourse 论坛，Python 的邮件列表可能要全面转向论坛了。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然确实很多老程序员都习惯了邮件列表，但是应该与时俱进，采用更丰富、更现代的交流方式。而同时保留老的交流方式，直到没什么人继续使用它，或因为缺乏重要功能而被废弃。",

          "description": "从 .deb 文件安装应用 非常简单。双击它，它会在软件中心中打开，然后从那里安装它。\n\r\n但是如何在 Ubuntu 或 Debian 中卸载 deb 包呢？如何删除一段时间前安装的软件包呢。\n\r\n虽然这有几个如果和但是，但删除 .deb 文件的最简单和最可靠的方法是使用 apt remove 命令。\n\r\nsudo apt remove program_name\r\n\n\r\n如你所见，你需要在这里知道确切的包名称。这可能并不总是显而易见的。例如，如果你在 Ubuntu 上安装 Google Chrome，则该程序在命令行中称为 “google-chrome-stable”。你已经知道了吗？我猜你不知道。\n\r\n在本教程中，我将详细介绍如何找到确切的包名称，然后使用它来删除应用。我还将讨论使用图形方法删除 deb 包。\n\r\n从 Ubuntu 中删除通过 .deb 文件安装的软件包\n\r\n在我向你展示如何从命令行删除 deb 包之前，让我们在软件中心应用中快速查看它。\n\r\n方法 1：检查应用是否可以从软件中心移除\n\r\nUbuntu 有软件中心 GUI 应用，允许搜索、安装和删除应用。\n\r\n搜索时，软件中心可能不会显示已安装的应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，如果向下滚动，你仍可能在“已安装”部分下找到它。外部应用通常不带徽标显示。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果找到它，你可以通过单击“垃圾桶”图标或“删除”按钮来删除该应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n一句话：检查是否可以从软件中心删除应用。\n\r\n方法 2：使用 apt 命令删除应用\n\r\n我假设你不知道该应用命令的确切名称。你可能不知道 Google Chrome 安装为 google-chrome-stable 而 Edge 安装为 microsoft-edge-stable，这很正常。\n\r\n如果你知道前几个字母，那么 tab 补全可能会有所帮助。否则，你可以 使用 apt 命令列出已安装的应用 并使用 grep 搜索应用程序名称：\n\r\napt list --installed | grep -i possible_package_name\r\n\n\r\n例如，你可以智能地猜测 Google Chrome 包的名称中应该包含 chrome。你可以这样搜索：\n\r\napt list --installed | grep -i chrome\r\n\n\r\n在某些情况下，你可能会得到多个结果。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你不确定这些软件包的作用，你可以随时通过以下方式获取它们的详细信息：\n\r\napt info exact_package_name\r\n\n\r\n获得确切的软件包名称后，你可以使用 apt remove 命令将其删除。\n\r\nsudo apt remove exact_package_name\r\n\n\r\n你还可以使用 apt-get remove 或 dpkg uninstall 命令来删除。\n\r\n\n\r\n方法 3：使用 Synaptic 包管理器删除 deb 应用\n\r\n另一种方法是使用 Synaptic 包管理器。在 GNOME 以“软件中心”的形式创建其图形包管理器之前，Synaptic 是 Ubuntu 和许多其他发行版中的默认 GUI 包管理器。\n\r\n它仍然是 Xfce 桌面环境 上的推荐工具。\n\r\n首先安装它：\n\r\nsudo apt install synaptic\r\n\n\r\n打开 Synaptic 并搜索包名称。查找标记为绿色的已安装软件包。右键单击它们，然后单击“标记为删除”。之后点击应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n对你有帮助吗？\n\r\n我非常乐意使用 apt 命令删除从 .deb 文件中安装的软件包。但我可以理解，并不是每个人都喜欢使用命令行。\n\r\n在删除从外部 .deb 文件安装的应用时，我发现软件中心中找不到它。软件中心还可以做的更好一些。\n\r\n我希望你现在对删除 deb 包有更好的了解。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/uninstall-deb-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "「记录」这件事就是非常有威力，它会把注意力之外的小细节收集起来，给予一种确实发生但又意料之外的生活视角。比如如果不是记账，我不知道原来每个月会支出那么多零零碎碎的「拿铁因子」；如果不是 HiWater，我也不会知道原来自己摄入那么多含糖饮料。\n其实我很早之前就购买过 WaterMinder 这款 App Store Editors's Choice 应用，只是彼时的我并不明白「多喝水」三个字对身体的意义，同时也觉得记录喝水这件事就像是记账——没有外部约束、「记录多少全凭诚实美德」的记录只在于自我娱乐。所以往往三天后意兴阑珊删除了事。\nHiWater 则是好友 @特伦 推荐的，把玩了下觉得还不错，但当时并不想为这个需求掏钱；不久前确诊痛风后，离开诊室满心灰暗的我有了「每天喝水 3L+」的刚需，这才发现这款应用的每一个付费点都值得我掏钱。\n作为一款国产应用，HiWater 的饮品目录预设种类都比较契合日常，并且在目录处还醒目地标注了每 100 毫升所带有的千卡热量。向下翻阅到高热量饮品时甚至有一种黑名单的既视感。\n\n如此设计的部分原因是，HiWater 采用了「饮水金字塔」模型，它将所有饮品归在六个等级内，并依此建议每日摄入的比例。此模型虽有哈佛大学公共卫生学院专家的背书，总体指导思想依然是鼓励大家多喝白水，减少摄入高糖、甚至是含糖饮料。\n关联阅读：如何合理控制糖分摄入\n\n对喝水提醒应用来说，我们一般会面临预设饮品难以覆盖真实世界情况的问题。\n所以在 HiWater 中我们也可以新增或编辑饮品类目到「饮水金字塔」模型中，把某个模糊的品类变成精确的单品。比如说 HiWater 预设了椰子水这个饮品，但我日常喝得比较多的是山姆椰子水，那我就直接编辑成山姆椰子水的营养成分，并重新归类到低卡饮料分类中去；再比如我喝的柠檬水是浓缩液和水 1:10 冲兑而来，因此我也通过计算将预设的「柠檬水」编辑成「自制柠檬水」，并由浓缩液计算出对应的热量。\n当然，手动编辑多了我们自然就会想：这些外包装上带有营养成分表的商品饮料，如何快捷记录到应用内？\nHiWater 的答案是「直接用相机扫」，请直接看这个动图：\n\n我猜测可能 Apple 在系统中给了 OCR 相关的 API，开发者就取来做这个功能了。这是我最喜欢的功能，实际使用起来识别比动图中要更迅速，识别率高且稳定。偶尔可能会有一些识别错误，比如把 ≥ 识别成 2，但我也能原谅。\n如此一来，在机场购买的农夫山泉力量帝柠檬水、屯了两箱的兰芳园低糖冻柠茶，都可以统统扫入我的饮品目录。记录时也可以根据自己的实际情况调整，比如冻柠茶虽是低糖，我还是会将它兑冰水或柠檬水喝，因此我的喝水记录里经常会出现 50 毫升的冻柠茶、紧接着出现 200 毫升的水或柠檬水。\n\n之前做手冲咖啡用的秤，现在大多被我用于称水喝，但后续我发现只要记住水倒在杯子上的花纹位置，不用秤也能大致知道这杯水的量。以名创优品的 580 毫升容积的可乐杯为例，杯内两道凹痕，分别可以粗略看作是 200/500 毫升的刻度。在公司喝水，可以考虑在工位启用大杯子装水，之前因为杯子小+次数少，上班时喝水太少。一周下来，确实每日喝水 3.3L 以上。\n\n其余的基础功能，诸如弹出提醒用户喝水、身体水分的简单预估、根据用户情况估算需要摄入的水量等，我就不一一展开了，WaterMinder 也有，我认为这些是一款「喝水类」App 都应该做的免费功能。其实我原先也是想通过快捷指令自己做一个提醒和记录每日喝水的应用，这不难，我甚至已经做好了 社死版快捷指令 定时运行，但体验过 HiWater 的一些交互后，我最后决定不折腾自己了。\n应用内还有不少花心思的交互和设计\nHiWater 多样的桌面小组件，还支出快捷录入饮品，打破了我对 iOS 小组件「能看不能用」的固有认知（我原先在 iOS 上并不使用任何 Widget，这一下就微上瘾了，顺带一口气添加了其余应用的小组件 xD）。\n精美的 Widget，支持快捷录入\nHiWater 采用免费下载+内购解锁的付费机制，如果你看完文章对它感兴趣，安装来把玩把玩也可以。如果想要为它付费的话，建议先确认自己有强烈的督促自己喝水的需求，然后订阅一个月试试——我直接买断是因为意识到「多喝水」这样的生活我可能要持续好几个月，甚至好几年，本身并不是很理性的消费习惯。\n如果一个应用能够帮助我长期维持某个健康习惯，我愿意给出「十刀买断，天大划算」的评价；如果没有，我也会用「三分钟热度三分钟收获」来安慰自己。\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "家庭治疗兴起于二十世纪中期，属于团体治疗（group therpay）的一部分。他们一致反对主流的声音，即认为心理症状只来自于个体本身，提出心理问题其实是来自个体与他人相处方式受到干扰所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗认为，心理症状是个体所处的家庭由于功能失调所带来的副产品。\n家庭治疗师从哲学和科学当中借鉴了一个理论：系统方法（system approach），即整体大于部分之和。换句话说，其实是从个人治疗的思想中切换到以家庭为单位（faimly-unit）治疗思想。治疗师关注的是整个家庭状况，而不是单独针对个人，将责任归咎于家庭中的某个人，或者指责某个人。所以，家庭治疗中，最基本的东西。过程中，家庭成员与治疗师一起努力，改善成员之间的互动，从而加强每个成员的心理健康。\n系统理论\n系统方法的核心是循环因果关系（Circular causality）比线性因果关系（Linear causality）更能解释心理问题。\n\n线性因果关系（Linear Casuality）：A 影响 B；但 B 不影响 A。意思是，父母对待孩子的方式影响孩子的后续行为，但孩子的后续行为并不会反过来影响父母。\n循环因果关系（Circular Casuality）：A 与 B 互相影响。意思是，父母对待孩的方式影响孩子的后续行为，而此种后续行为也同样影响着父母。\n\n家庭中，普遍存在的问题是不健康的沟通模式。在家庭治疗的早期，很多理论家将它与病理结果结合在一起，诞生了最为著名和有趣的两个例子。第一个例子是「精神分裂症母亲」（Fromm-Reichamnn, 1948）。这个理论认为，专制且冷酷的母亲与无能、弱势的父亲结合在一起，会导致孩子精神分裂。第二个理论是双重束缚理论（Bateson, Jackson, Haley, & Weakland, 1956)。这个理论认为，父母一直给孩子不可避免的混合命令，也会导…",

          "description": "自《PasteNow for iOS 正式发布》后，已有三个月没有介绍 PasteNow 了。这三个月，PasteNow 也没有停止进化的脚步，分别迭代了 2.1、2.2 和 2.3 这几个版本，其中 2.3 于今天刚刚发布。本篇即是汇总一下过去三个月 PasteNow 的发展与变化。\n支持 Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴\n正如标题所说，2.3 版本带来了「Word、Pages 下多个项目粘贴」的功能。这是 PasteNow 迄今为止非常重要的一个改进，不仅带来更加一致的体验，同时也大大提升效率。解决这个问题其实有点周折，我先简单地补充一下背景：\n\nWord 和 Pages，因为其固有机制的原因（也许是 Bug），它不支持剪贴板的多项目粘贴。也就说是，往剪贴板里写入多项内容，再在 Word 里操作粘贴，你会发现只有第一个内容粘贴了进去，但是如果同样在备忘录（或其他 App）里操作粘贴，是会出现多个内容的。\n\nPasteNow 的用户最早在去年7月就给我汇报了这个问题，当时我发现是 Word 和 Pages 的固有机制导致的问题后，决定暂时观察一段时间，因为也许 Word 在更新后会「修复」这个问题。\n但是等了很久，这个行为始终没有发生变化，看来确实是固有机制的限制了。正好最近又有用户汇报了相关问题，我换了一下思路，看看能不能从 PasteNow 这边做点什么的方式来解决这个问题。于是还真让我找到了一个办法。\n假如你是 Word、Pages 等的重度用户，经常需要粘贴内容至 Word、Pages 里，特别是一次性粘贴多项内容，现在通过 PasteNow 可以更好的做到这些了。请看视频！\n \n更加全面和完善的快捷键体验\n作为一个效率工具，能100%通过快捷键来达成各种操作一直是 PasteNow 重点优化的方向。在过去几个版本中，PasteNow 加强了以下两方面的快捷键体验：\n\n支持将 F1～F12 录制成快捷键了，这意味着可以用更加轻松的「单键」来达成 PasteNow 的各项操作；\n支持通过按下“@、%、$”等特殊符号也进入快速搜索模式；\n「添加标题」和「编辑文本」操作，也有了专属快捷键，分别是：Command + T 和 Command + E。\n\n相信通过以上快捷键的改进，使用 PasteNow 的过程将更加流畅。\niOS 版本的变化\n三个月前的主要事件是 iOS 版本的发布，过去三个月，iOS 版本发展的怎么样呢？这里不得不承认一个事实，这个版本并没有达到各种预期，无论是我作为开发者的预期，还是用户对它的预期。\n首先是我作为开发者的预期，目前 iOS 版本的用户非常少，日活跃用户最多时仅为 macOS 版本的 1/15。相当于 15 个 macOS 版本用户才对应 1 个 iOS 版本。这其实也是在我的预期中，但没想到会差这么多。\n另一方面是作为用户的预期，很多用户对这款 iOS 产品寄予了厚望，以为也可以像 macOS 版本一样做到后台记录剪贴板内容、实时同步剪贴板数据。但事实是这个从 iOS 的机制上就做不到，并且在即将发布的 iOS 16 里，对剪贴板的操作将会进一步变得更难。\n以上当然不是用户预期的问题，而是我在打造这款产品时没有准确的传达信息导致的，后续在 iOS 版本中，我将增加一个 FAQ 模块，让用户可以非常直观地了解到这个工具能做什么，不能做什么等等。\n当然，我依然会尽力去完善 iOS 版本的体验，使其与 macOS 的基本功能靠近，比如在 2.3 版本当中，图片类的数据，现在也可以通过长按保存至相册了。这个是会比较实用且基础的一个操作。\n小结\nPasteNow 从 1.0 发布到今天，不过一年又三个多月，它依然是一款年轻的产品，我会继续按照既定节奏去稳步迭代，不断完善它的体验与其他 App 的互操作能力。\n希望它继续给大家带来愉悦的效率之旅～\n附：少数派下载与购买链接。\n \n \n演示：PasteNow 2.3 多项目粘贴至 Word",

          "description": "前言\n7月特斯拉官宣了消息，上海的32座特斯拉超充站开启了分时电价计算，每日的22时到次日8时，开始计算谷时电价，最低可以到1.28一度电，贵一些的超充站谷时电价也能在1.5左右。比起上海之前普遍1.8的谷时电价要低上不少。 \n\n2022年作为纯电车补贴和优惠政策的收尾年，纯电车销量有了极大程度的提高，没有家充桩，还要解决车量的日常充电是诸多车主所面临的一个情况，本篇来分享一下使用野外第三方充电桩的体验与技巧。\n野外充电桩的种类\n\n熟悉纯电车会知道，除了特别低价的车型，市面上主流的车型都会配备两个国标充电接口，左边的是连接直流充电设备的快充接口；右边是连接交流设备的七孔慢充接口。\n\n对于绝大多数车主而言，在外打野都是充快充的直流充电桩，因为涉及到变压器、安全保护措施、粗电缆，直流桩设备体积相当大，一眼就能识别。目前市面上的直流充电桩主要功率有30KW、60KW、120KW和特斯拉V3超充的250KW，这里的功率是指峰值功率，车辆实际快充保持在峰值功率的时间是非常短的。\n\n当然，除了直流充电桩，第三方还有交流充电桩提供给车主们使用，一般会设计在小区、商场、办公楼地库和CBD中，主要就是给相对固定的车主使用，基本都是配220V电，一般功率是3.5KW或7KW。\n两者相比，大电流的直流充电桩充电速度快，交流充电桩则对于电池更友好。目前直流充电桩肯定是大家使用第三方野桩的核心选择。\n野外充电桩的品牌\n品牌方面，宏观上分为车企自有充电桩和第三方运营商充电桩。\n\n车企自有充电桩方面，最具代表性是特斯拉的超充站，在上海基本立足于百联、万达等各大商场，也辐射一些居民区、商务区和高速服务区。车企自有充电桩的核心优势是只有车主可以使用，不会被占位，充电环境好；劣势就是价格相对较高。目前特斯拉的超充站覆盖面最广，蔚来、小鹏、极氪、上汽大众系也都有充电服务区分布在上海，基本都是以快充为主，上汽系会…",

          "description": "月初我在特斯拉官网下单了一台2021年5月份出厂的二手长续航Model Y，这周终于提车了。\n之前我对特斯拉这个公司的印象还可以，比如严格遵守劳动法等，不过这次在官网购买二手车的经历让我觉得特斯拉至少二手车部门的一些流程是不规范的，甚至可能会侵犯购车者的权益，让我觉得无怪乎会发生“韩潮事件1”。\n本文和大家分享一下我的购车经历，其中有捡漏攻略和可能会被坑的点，希望对大家有帮助。\nQ：为什么要买官网二手？\n首先第一个好处是省钱，还能更快提到车，现在新车下单要预计20-24周才能提车（长续航Model Y 为例），而官网二手在下单成功后7个工作日以内就能拿到车。\n其次官网购买二手车会送一年整车质保，这个质保期是叠加在新车保质期上的，因此如果购买一年以内的官网二手车，会出现二手车整车质保期比新车还长的现象；不过三电质保没有送。那么在官网二手的价格没有比其他二手平台的价格贵太多的情况下，为了这一年质保也是很划算的。事实上在我下单那几天对比后发现，差不多车况的情况下，特斯拉官网二手的价格基本和第三方二手平台持平或略低。\n最后我喜欢玩房车，计划购买 Model Y 后在买个拖挂房车玩玩。海外版包括22年之前的国产版Model Y都是原车自带拖挂装置安装孔位以及拖挂房车通信线束的，车机上也有拖挂模式，在线束和房车连接时就会激活。然而22款的国产Model Y 取消了拖挂模式，安装孔位和线束虽然还在，但线束已经没有任何信号了。这样我别无选择只能购买21款Model Y。\n官网二手车的质保描述\n​\nQ：官网买二手还能捡漏？\n是的，官网二手虽然也是一口价的模式，联系客服也没法砍价，但在每天晚上 11点 到 11 点 05分左右都会下调一次价格，幅度在 1000-3000 元都有；在每天下午 3 点左右，官网还会对部分二手车进行涨价，一些一直没卖出的车在降价到一定幅度时会涨价到刚上架时到价格，然…",

The economy of the Dutch Republic, as it was then known, was flourishing as Antwerp and other ports became important hubs for the commercial shipping trade, importing and exporting textiles, spices, and metals, and the cities’ populations swelled. Elaborately detailed oil paintings depicting food on the table or incredible flower arrangements were popular additions to wealthy merchants’ homes, yet a more ominous genre of still-life painting also emerged amid this period of immense growth.

Curry debuted as a New York City street artist known as Swoon right around the turn of the last century, her hand-worked portraits making striking, albeit illegal, statements on old walls. Today, she harnesses that same energy into intricate—and intimate—installations set in museums and galleries.\nWhen I look at a face for days, when I take a portrait of somebody on the street, and then I stare at that face for days and days, there’s this part of my brain that’s like, “This human is utterly perfect.\n More",
