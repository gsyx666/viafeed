Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.\nSample code showing a simple Set object usage:\nfunction main() {\n\n    const gameScreen = document.getElementById('game-screen')\n    gameScreen.addEventListener('click' updateAction)\n\n    const cursorPositions = new Set()\n    function updateAction(event) {\n      let position = {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}\n      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case\n    }\n    // use unique cursorPositions below\n}\n\nwhile(true) {\n  main()\n}\n\nDuplicate values are discarded when added to a set. This is useful for capturing and storing unique values where duplicate values are not needed.\nconst letters = new Set()\nletters.add('A')\nletters.add('B')\nletters.add('A') // duplicate entry is ignored\nconsole.log(letters) // Set {2} {'A', 'B'} \n\nThe set object provides a way of storing data where duplicate values are not required.\nNote: Most languages including JavaScript offer a lot of language features but it’s not a good approach to try learning all these language features at a go. However, knowing they exist is enough as it helps one know where to look when the need arises.",

It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.\nAnyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that's the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.\nWell then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for \"production\"). \nHopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).\nI don't think it's necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn. So now the next step is to take this experience and continue the journey. It's still just the beginning.",

We then send the request.\nIf the request is successful, we will get the response body. We will then extract the data from the body and log it to the console. \nYou can try running the code in your browser.

It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. \nOne of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. \nSvelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient. If you are looking for a new JavaScript framework, Svelte is definitely worth considering. \nThanks for reading!\nKindly follow me for more topics on Svelte https://GitHub.com/yakumwamba\nTwitter.com/brianlemba",

Changes therfore reverted including improvements.\n\n\nDevelopers work on ad-hoc tasks, interrupted by client support with nonsense issues.\n\n\nclient support has no understanding of iasues and can't replicate it befoee pasaing on to devs.\n\n\nclients calling developers on the phone.\n\n\ndev team manager coding\n\n\nno version control. Backups restored, changes lost, task solved become unresolved.\n\n\ntickets contain multiple tasks, often left halfway done and closed.\n\n\ntemplates arent updated as per latest data changes, old code commented out, duplicate codes.\n\n\ndevelopers aren't aware what the rest of the team is working on. \n\n\n\nI'm not saying this is bad, it's not wfficient. Junior take a long time to -if ever- understand the whole project and their skills remain unexploited. Validity of development can only be seen when task is completed, so if it's worthless, then all the time and work went down the toilet. The product isn't evolving, only the codebase becomes larger.",

          "description": "一年又一年，Apple 在今天发布了由 iPhone 13 Pro 拍摄的虎年新春影片《卷土重来》，这部影片是 Apple 发布的第五支新春影片，也是与过去四部影片完全不同的一部作品。\n\n首先是时长，《卷土重来》的片长有 23 分钟之久，与之相比，2018 年发布的首支 Apple 新春影片《三分钟》的片长为 7 分钟、去年发布的《阿年》为 12 分钟。其次是类型元素，与过去人物关系、道具场景都相对简单的四部影片不同，我们在《卷土重来》中可以看到传统武打、好莱坞科幻、乡土情怀、幽默喜剧、父子亲情等多种电影风格类型，道具和场景方面包含了机器人和机器狗、全地形车、火星基地、飞船模型等等，制作规模进一步突破。\n《卷土重来》讲述的是电影梦碎的儿子，跟一个异想天开的父亲，为了把无人问津的村子打造成网红景点，率领一众村民拍摄火星大电影的故事。身为替身武打演员的儿子，在一次拍摄中不慎受伤之后无奈回村，接受了电影梦破灭现实的他，希望利用多年积攒下来的积蓄，将父亲接去城市生活，告别土地贫瘠、生活环境恶劣的乡村。父亲则希望为乡村拍摄一部影片，希望通过这部影片将乡村走出困境，同时也帮助儿子圆一次电影梦。\n影片从父子之间的矛盾作为展开，儿子希望带领父亲逃离「除了沙尘一无所有，荒凉得跟个火星似的」乡村，前往城市生活；父亲则从儿子的话语中收获了不一样的理解：那就拍一部关于「火星」的电影。这里展现的，不仅是现实中父母与子女常有的矛盾冲突，也代表了两代人对于困难、梦想的不一样的看法：20 岁的儿子虽然怀揣电影梦，但是遇到困难就决定接受现实、放弃梦想；60 岁的父亲却对梦想执着追求，不仅希望帮助儿子圆一次电影梦，也对于生活了一辈子的乡村仍抱有希望，对于村民抱有希望。\n\n影片背后留下的不少线索，也埋藏了对于现代生活的各种还原。比如父亲希望拍摄视频放到网上，将村子打造成网红景点，正是当下短视频时代的一种社会缩影…",

          "description": "先说结论：\n目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。\n\n\n正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。\n事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。\n无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。\n针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。\n他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。\n这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。\n除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 \n简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。\n\n\n但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。\n所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。\n但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。\nSAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: \n\n当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。\n因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。\n驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…\n而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…\n双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。\n\n\n更多的的讨论可以关注我之前的一些回答：\n南京一特斯拉司机早高峰开自动驾驶脱把睡觉，这一行为违法吗？如何看待目前的「自动驾驶」技术？\nL5 真的能实现吗？或者说，未来无人驾驶真的会成为常态吗？\n如果未来交通工具都是自动驾驶，你能做到安心出行吗？\n复旦教授杨珉公开质疑理想汽车「自动驾驶安全性没有想象的那么香，事关人命」，目前阶段的自动驾驶靠谱吗？\n\n\n以及这个视频：\n【德国博士】完全无人驾驶有可能实现么？L5安全性悖论及未来智慧城市出行的展望\n\n参考文献\n\nhttps://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/self-driving-car-statistics/\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety\n\n\n留德华叫兽\n点击下载\n86 个回答，查看全部。\n喝了酒以后，让特斯拉自动驾驶，算酒驾吗？\n美国的联邦法律是如何产生的？",

          "description": "将汽车轮胎按照地区分类，大致可以分为欧洲、北美、日韩、东南亚、中国。轮胎和所在地汽车工业息息相关，甚至间接决定了品牌定位。\n典型如韩国，韩国汽车产品定位亲民家用，韩泰、锦湖也比较注重这方面。日本和美国是汽车老牌大国，两国汽车市场高度捆绑，所以两国轮胎品牌也主要以经济和越野为主。中国和东南亚地区的轮胎品牌，也都根据当地的汽车企业定位，诞生了比如玛吉斯、佳通、朝阳、玲珑等主要轮胎品牌。\n欧洲有些不同的是，作为汽车的发源地，大量的运动赛事和跑车、豪华、家用、经济型汽车的全方位涉足，使得欧洲诞生了诸多性能顶级、品类全面的轮胎品牌，包括大家耳熟能详的德国马牌、米其林和倍耐力等。\n\n\n选择合适的轮胎前，先搞清楚需求。\n大多数轮胎品牌都有从上到下全面的布局，有经济、豪华、舒适、性能等各个系列，所以如果不是完全家用、经济趋向的车型，售价在15万以上，对操控、静音有些要求时就可以重点考虑欧洲品牌了。\n问题是，一款轮胎不可能方方面面做到尽善尽美，如果有，那就是方方面面都不是最好。\n如果在意成本，应该侧重考虑耐磨，但是耐磨一定程度上会影响舒适性和操控性，噪音也会增加。对于一些非入门车型来说有些得不偿失。出租车一般会倾向选择耐磨轮胎。\n如果在意性能，比如领克03+、高尔夫GTI、宝马240i这一类的车子，需要重点考虑抓地力。抓地力好的轮胎可以有效提升车辆极限，相应的耐磨会变差。如果为了迁就耐磨，整车性能得不到发挥，事实上会造成更大的浪费。\n\n\n如果是商务出行，比如别克GL8、奔驰V一类的车型，需要重点考虑舒适性。\n如果是新能源车型或者豪华轿车，由于先天出色的静谧性或者对静谧性的高要求，应该侧重静谧性选择轮胎，以获得更加安静的乘坐感受。\n有了需求就可以按图索骥选择产品了。多数汽车品牌有明确的系列划分，要理解一点都不困难，比如德国马牌旗下一共有三个大类：全能、运动和越野，命名规则是Conti-XXXX…",

          "description": "我喜欢这句话，“我们无权评论别人的人生，同理别人也不可以。”\n肯定有许多人会过来阴阳怪气，“那可真是无权”（评论区果为如此，承认自己可能是特别难的一件事）。\n不患人之不己知，患其不能也。\n因为没有人能够比事主自己更了解自己，所以没法评价人生；对于同理，假装情绪去“可怜或者怜惜”我觉得想必都是虚伪的：不知他人苦，无法同理。\n在不违法的前提下，做任何事情都是自己的自由，网间相传的事情，狗头萝莉这样一位主播何尝不是类似于“陈冠希门”一般的受害者呢？\n关于早年的猥亵和强奸，既然已经在网上公开，不妨报警，众所周知，无论猥亵还是强奸如果要走法律程序，那么其重点就是证据。想要证明犯罪事实，至少要有以下核心证据中的几个形成证据体系：\n\n医院病历以及报告单（可能非常不容易取到，时间已经相隔太久）\n被告人的供述以及辩解（有大概率可以取得）\n受害人的陈述以及辨认笔录（确凿取得）\n案发现场勘验检查笔录以及照片（难以取得）\n能够证明双方是否发生性关系的精斑检验鉴定意见书（难以取得）\n能够证明被告人是否采取暴力、胁迫或其他手段以威吓受害人的证人证言（可能可以取得）\n能够证明受害人是否曾通过微信、短信和电话等方式向外传递求救信息的证人证言（刑事侦查可以恢复电子数文）\n能够证明受害人是否存在反抗、胁迫等迹象的案发现场（酒店入口、走廊）监控视频\n\n在以上证据的采集上，毋庸置疑，警方是十分专业的。然而由于本事件自发生到报警，时间间隔已经较长了，部分证据的取得可能难度颇大，不过在知乎依旧怀有热情的时代，我想会有无数愿意给予协助帮助的人。\n当然，关于刑事方面的建议我还是更为推荐去做专业咨询（我只能大体给一点点提示，这不是我擅长的领域，可以咨询两位女律师 @黄小牛 @王逸然 ）。\n关于高额违约金，涉及违约要付出的成本，让狗头萝莉背上高额违约金的原因是合同约定发生根本性违约时应当支付高额违约金——这件事情愿打愿挨，没有什么办法。\n虽然都说，违约金，性质上以补偿性为主，惩罚性为辅。\n但实际里面，无论是法院判决还是仲裁，其实都会基于会综合考虑实际损失、履行情况、过错程度、预期利益等因素，并根据公平和诚实信用原则进行认定。\n其中会重点考虑主播的知名程度、主播的主观过错、平台对主播培养和人气维系的情况、平台基于连续性合同履行所产生的预期利益损失。\n从合作之初，其实甲方设计来说，本就是律师通过精巧的合同设计来约束主播，而主播的行为被装进款式多样的违约套餐中。\n稍有不慎，就会触发高额索赔。\n纵然知道违约金很高，然而主播还是得签：无他，双方地位本来初始就不平等。\n当然，对于类似虎牙平台的资源倾斜来说（一个主播很多时候都是资源堆出来的），确实也具有设置高额违约金的必要性。\n以主播韦朕8522万天价违约金案为例，裁判机构一般会认为直播作为新兴产业具有较强的行业特点，直播平台对主播依赖性较强且行业间竞争激烈，平台经营者需要投入大量人力物力进行主播的推广和人气维系，顶级主播的直播间观看人数和粉丝数量对平台利益具有重大隐形关联。\n当然我想最开始签约的时候，狗头萝莉甚至不能完全理解合约对于自身的限制程度（比如私德条款之类纵然明星都不了解，何况一个游戏主播）。\n可是她既然在网络上说了她的过往，我想从法律上也许不是她不懂，而是已经失去了心气，这个时候的她，依旧还希望有人会倾泻予她以阳光。\n想起有个KWM的姑娘很善良，前天转过来她直播时候的视频，并评论“唏嘘于人生的不同，但是可以从泫然欲泪里感受不甘，以及无法脱身”。\n面包和牛奶都会有的，要振作起来，自己可以拯救自己，做一个你曾经想要成为的，能给大家带来更多美好的人吧。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nLegal诗睿\n点击下载\n728 个回答，查看全部。\n游戏直播时声音好听的女主播的萝莉音是伪音吗？\n如何看待黑粉黑蔡萝莉？",

          "description": "《新围棋少年》即将在2022年播出，自立项以来，《新围棋少年》也是历经各种磨难，好在项目在央视动画领导的鼓励和围棋少年粉丝的大力支持下，《新围棋少年》一步步走完了它的创作历程。由于制作费用非常低，我们无法招到国内优秀的分镜师，最后导演和我商量，我只能在我的微博平台上公开招分镜师，大量对围棋少年有情怀的粉丝报名参加分镜师的招聘，最后经过我们认真的筛选，我们从粉丝队伍中招到了大部分我们需要的分镜师，他们中有大三学生、有超市职工，他们年轻、有热情，更重要的是他们有天赋，作为从来没有带过分镜人员的我，也是硬着头皮天天跟他们开会讨论，我也从一个新围棋少年编剧的角色转化到分镜带片导演的角色上了。我觉得也许是上苍特别眷顾我们《围棋少年》，《新围棋少年》经常是在各种让我们绝望的路上，突然上苍给我们我们希望，我们靠着这批大部分人跟分镜从来没有关系的分镜师完成了《新围棋少年》分镜的整体工作。这个项目也让这批以前从没想过走动画分镜的青年，渐渐走上了动画分镜师的道路，我非常感谢这些拥有天赋的年轻人，在《新围棋少年》分镜最困难的时候，用他们出色的才华，帮助我们完成了《新围棋少年》的分镜工作。\n我年轻的时候，曾经写过大量小品，当时我们企业中有一支喜欢表演的青年剧社，如今这些小品演员早已不再年前，他们都已经成家立业并在各自的工作岗位中担任重要工作。但我们在做《新围棋少年》分镜时需要预配音演员，他们都非常支持我，我再次把他们组织起来一起来做配音，另外粉丝中一个叫小宇的北方小伙子，也是边倒班边参加我们的预配音工作。就这样，我们这支预配音的队伍出色地完成了《新围棋少年》分镜工作前的全部预配音，他们非常投入地扮演剧中的每一个角色，由于他们曾经都有过舞台表演的训练，所以表演配音角色也是得心应手，尽管他们的音质达不到专业配音演员的水平，但角色的刻画上，我觉得也是不差于专业配音演员的。我也是既当配音导演也当配音演员，一起参与整个预配音的工作，这个工作再次让我感觉到当年在舞台上既写小品剧本又当小品演员那种快乐。我们的预配音工作得到了导演的肯定。\n音乐是《新围棋少年》中非常重要的一个环节，《新围棋少年》是一部情感大戏，这样的大戏要非常细腻动听的背景音乐来烘托，我们在寻找音乐制作方面也是捉襟见肘，幸亏粉丝们帮忙联系了著名的音乐制作人魏小涵先生，他制作过非常多、非常出名的动画片的音乐，他爽快答应为《新围棋少年》创作音乐，由于后来时间紧，著名的作曲人刘聪先生也加入到我们的音乐创作中。我们这次《新围棋少年》的音乐总长超过了200分钟，音乐非常动听，用音乐把剧中的剧情、人物情感刻画的非常出色。我非常享受跟作曲商讨音乐的过程，当一段动听的音乐配上了出色的剧情时，我常常会激动的一夜未眠。在这里，我再次感谢魏小涵先生、刘聪先生，感谢你们创作出如此优美动听的音乐。当然，我希望你们能忘记在创作过程中我跟你们面红耳赤的吵架段落。\n\n\n关于《新围棋少年》棋谱问题，我这里也要做一下解答，棋谱是围棋少年播出后被人诟病最多的部分，原因在于围棋指导给出棋谱后，后面分镜和制作人员不懂围棋棋谱，而且当年的技术可能是要一个个画到镜头里，这个工作非常繁琐，所以他们也不会一个个对应去画。这次《新围棋少年》棋谱，我亲自盯，主要是我略懂围棋，可以跟围棋指导商量做出剧情中所需要的围棋棋谱，我要求围棋指导做出的是电子棋谱，然后发给分镜师和中期公司，尽量让他们按电子棋谱上标注的位置和顺序落子。这样就会尽最大可能防止棋谱出现问题。当然，由于经费的问题，我们不可能出的棋谱都是由职业棋手设计出来的，而《棋魂》当时的棋谱都是由职业棋手（包括著名的一些九段棋手）出的棋谱，这点上，我们是望尘莫及的。这次两人对弈的棋谱基本上都有围棋指导出棋谱，当然也有不少剧本中出现但没有具体的下棋场面，分镜和中后期人员手上就没有棋谱了，比如说闹哄哄的棋馆众人下棋场景，这里我们主要对正在对弈的人物有棋谱，但对一晃而过的众人下棋场面可能棋谱就不那么严谨了。再有一些表现背景的棋谱，原来以为一闪而过的画面，我们就不太注意了。但如果一定格，这些棋谱问题还是很明显的。\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n妖刀王\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\nCOMIC LO杂志前一百期有哪些经典内容？\n如何制作一张好的学术海报（poster）？",

          "description": "三连冠，这是中国汽车品牌车队在世界赛车圈的一个高光时刻，意义非凡。\n\nWTCR是什么\n讲别的之前，我们应该先了解，领克拿了三连冠的这个WTCR比赛是一个什么比赛。这是一项国际顶级赛车比赛，前身是房车赛中的顶流比赛，世界房车锦标赛WTCC，而在2018年正式引入TCR规格赛车后， WTCC正式进化成为WTCR。笼统点说，参加WTCR比赛的赛车有一个最显著的特点，需要基于原厂车型改装得来，必须具有量产车车架号并且年产量需要在5000台以上。也就是说，领克车队用于夺得三连冠的领克03TCR赛车，就是赛化改装的领克03。\n\n拿到WTCR冠军有多难？\n既然是国际顶级比赛，那么就意味着这是一个神仙打架的比赛，因为这个比赛把赛车本身的性能各项参数都规定的很死。对于赛车完整版的技术规则就如同下面的截图中写的，数据来自于维基百科，如果有出入也欢迎大家指正。\n\n摘取重点来说，对于赛车本身来说，需要基于有车架号的量产车改装，发动机使用2.0T，使用前轮驱动布局，发动机最高不得超过350马力，用量产变速器不得轻于1250kg，用赛用变速器不得轻于1285kg。这规则如果定的太细，赛车在性能方面的表现可以说是大差不差了。\n\n有人说，那疯狂改装能不能获得相对别人的火星车呢？且不说基本上能改的都被规则限制住了，就算是要改，这比赛还有个最重要的指标，打造成本不得高于13万欧元，就这么一个成本的大圈把赛车们都框住了，可操作空间就变的更小了。\n\n这都不算完，还有个最重要的事，BoP（Balance of Performance，性能平衡机制），简单说来就是你表现的越好，你下次比赛可能会被加重量，也有可能被限制发动机输出功率，你越拿好成绩，你下次比赛的时候性能就越受影响，就是在这样的情况下，领克车队连续三年拿到了车队总冠军，车手扬·埃赫拉舍连续两年拿到了车手总冠军，这更加证明了，领克车队的领克03TCR赛车，还有车手，是真的快。想看教主白嫖领克03TCR赛车的，欢迎在评论区为我打个1.\n\n在性能上大家相近的比赛，更考验技师实力和车手实力，领克通过资金实力、中国品牌实力吸引着强有力的团队加入，强大的赛车、优秀的团队和强大的车手共同孕育出了一次又一次的胜利。夺冠的那一刻，很多玩车人其实都已热泪盈眶，这绝对是一个值得纪念的历史时刻。\n\n拿到这个冠军有什么意义？\n一个中国品牌车队，用基于中国品牌量产车改装而打造出来的TCR赛车，在国际赛场上连续三年夺得车队总冠军，这应该是目前对中国汽车工业发展日益壮大的最佳证明。领克2019年打造出03TCR赛车，当年的车队总冠军就直接收入囊中，接下来，2020年和2021年，领克车队几乎成了WTCR赛场上的统治者。\n\n在国际赛车比赛上拿到好成绩，就像在奥运会上夺得金牌一样，是一种实力的证明。领克做到了靠实际表现来证明自己的实力，证明了中国汽车厂商的实力。以后若是有键盘车神说中国赛车不行，我想领克这个WTCR三连冠就是拿去打脸的最佳材料吧。\n\n中国汽车工业发展多年，其实在汽车运动方面一直没有停止探索，在世界的一些大型赛事上，也能看到中国汽车品牌车队的身影。比如领克车队在WTCR，成龙车队在WEC，还有参加达喀尔的数家厂商等等，他们都是在用自己的实力去证明自己。\n\n对于顶流汽车赛事F1来说，我们目前没有F1车队，但是已经有了第一位华人F1车手——周冠宇，这需要付出大量的努力，很庆幸有人还从未放弃过。\n\n对于国内来说，越来越多的人都在接触汽车运动，我做键盘车神教这么多年，看到了非常多的爱好者在用自己的方式去参加汽车运动，去锻炼自己的驾驶技术。\n\n而作为厂商，积极参与赛车比赛，获得更多的国际冠军席位，定能够让更多的人被吸引进来，对于中国品牌汽车来说，也就有了更多的底气制造运动型汽车。这是一件正相关、正增益的事情，领克在使用基于领克03打造出的03 TCR赛车夺得三连冠的同时，又打造出领克03+这样的性能取向中国品牌汽车，领克汽车可以称为是绝对的引领者了。未来，在他的带领下，中国品牌在性能取向上打造的汽车，肯定会越来越多。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n鲁超\n点击下载\n9 个回答，查看全部。\n领克02hatchback和领克032.0冠军版怎么选？\n领克03冠军版与03+驭风版你会选择那个？",

          "description": "看了一圈问题底下的回答其实都答的很到位，我稍微做个补充吧\n先上个答案：会也不会\n我本人高中就在北美，赛车方面从跑加拿大的国家级卡丁车比赛到f4方程式和现在的Radical cup和运动原型车也有N年了，tcr和gt4一类的房车也做过测试（个人还是更习惯开放座舱一些），算是个职业选手吧。公路上是16岁拿的驾照17岁买了第一台车，到现在也开了5年的车了，从一开始的suv到现在的改装过的性能车前后也买过开过不少车，没有国内驾驶经验但是北美交规和限速也差不多。总体顺序是先拿的赛照再拿的驾照，是比较典型的赛车和公路混开的，在两个方面都有足够的经验可以说明问题。\n我有很多朋友问过我这个问题，我也仔细考虑过。我认为首先虽然都是开车，但是这俩完全是两个概念，从心态上还有环境上就有根本的不同。\n赛车尤其是比赛（不是自己做圈速练习）是作为竞技运动的心态而非协作，侧重点是操作细节够不够细腻，攻防策略还有轮胎管理。赛道作为一个理想的可控环境（一般来说对手也比较可控）开得快本身已经成为了一个比较程式化的东西，驾驶的关注点是对驾驶节奏的控制，这个时候感觉到的快并不是传统意义上的开的速度有多快，而是节奏和细节上的快，比如这个弯道下午的胎胶比上午的多温度比上午高我可以用更快的速度入弯同时也可以做到同样的出弯速度和线路，整体节奏就可以快一些。这种有目的快和逼近车辆极限是有心理压力的是有风险的，尤其是在赛道上第一次出事故以后（早晚的事儿）感觉会越来越明显。至于题主想问的直线速度…大直道是用来考虑下几个弯怎么过的。\n公路驾驶偏向于协作，在路上开车心态更多的是怎么和别的车合作可以让出行的效率高一些。公路上的很多环境并不可控…比如路上走着走着突然掉头的或者是不打灯突然并道抢道的，行人/红绿灯和复杂的道路环境导致相比于赛道一条平整宽阔的顺/逆时针环路，公路非常没有可预见性，加上如果路烂全是坑导致车变得非常不可控，就算是限速内都会觉得吓人…目的上来讲，公路上没有那种为了快而快，去逼近车辆极限的目的性和心理压力，对于速度的关注更偏向于自己能多快到达目的地，所以公路和赛车根本就是关注点和目的都完全不一样的两个概念，自然不会觉得平时路上的速度太慢。\n加上赛车普遍对自己冒的风险和用风险换来的收益经常做评估（就是所谓的策略），以至于赛车开多了也会把这个习惯带到公路上。我的很多队友都是在赛道上风格越野越快的在公路上就开的越怂…\n至于会感觉到慢：开完赛车再开公路能感觉到的慢不是速度上的慢，更多的是对其他车拖泥带水的操作觉得慢。拿我个人举例，我练完车回家的路上会觉得，哎前面这个人为啥要瞎踩刹车，这个人右转为什么非要几乎刹停再转，这个人上个匝道ramp为啥这么小心翼翼这么墨迹…等等等等。不过我以前刚练完车比完赛出赛车场回家也会下意识的带一些赛道驾驶的东西…下意识做了个trail braking重刹拖了个档，赛车转向比还没适应回公路车导致转弯转不好，或者是心态还是竞技心态没平复下来，这两年这毛病好了很多…\n总结一下，对我个人来说赛车和公路驾驶完全是两码子事儿驾驶者也是两种模式所以在速度上并不会觉得公路驾驶慢，但是有时候会觉得别的车开的拖泥带水有很多无意义的蜜汁操作…\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nCoalescence\n点击下载\n37 个回答，查看全部。\n赛车手需要学习漂移吗？\n如果中国有一条不限速的直道公路，你愿意来飙车车吗？",

          "description": "这个问题提的特别好，原因是方方面面的。既然题目里问的是在“人类的烹饪文化”中，那就先从“烹饪”这个角度来说吧：\n1. 从烹饪角度来说，盐是最“容易出味”的调味品。\n“盐者，百肴之将”[1]，意思就是盐为\"百味之首”，是所有菜肴的统帅，是最广泛使用和最古老的食品调味料之一。从烹饪的角度来看，盐极具性价比——添加盐可以改善人类食用的几乎所有食物的口感，而且价格便宜。在很多情况下，添加盐会增强食物的“积极感官风味”，这个词是我从咖啡感官杯测学习中借鉴来的，意思就是，会让一些原本很难吃的食物变得易于人类入口食用。这在古代食物困乏的时代对于人类自身生存至关重要。\n同时，盐赋予食物整体风味的不仅仅是“咸味”，如果大家日常做饭比较多的话，可以仔细体会下这些现象——盐可以改变人类味觉对于食物“多层次厚度，平衡感”的感知。可以增强甜味，提高鲜味，掩盖金属或者化学异味，并在提高风味强度的同时完善整体风味特征。\n\n比如盐可以增强甜味，吃西瓜放一丢丢盐，吃起来感觉更甜。果汁和米酒，加一些盐，喝起来更甜。\n比如盐可以增加鲜味，日本家庭做菜最常用的“出汁“，是用多种成分混合成的调味料，再加一丢丢盐，味道就会变得更加鲜美。\n比如盐可以增强食物口感的丰富度，在汤中加入盐后，不仅会增加汤的咸味，而且还会增加其他”积极感官属性“，比如醇厚度、丰满度、 和整体口味平衡感[2]。\n\n\n另外最早用盐也是为了在没有冰箱没有其他保鲜技术的时代，可以更好的保存食物。[3]这样人类饮食对于季节性的依赖度降低，给长途旅行和淡季生存提供了可能性。\n2.盐对于人体机能的重要性和不可替代性\n人类对于“盐”的渴望，很大程度上是因为盐的主要成分氯化钠对人体维持健康至关重要。 它是人类饮食中钠离子和氯离子的主要来源。 钠对神经和肌肉功能至关重要，并参与体内液体的调节，促进消化液分泌、维持胃蛋白酶作用环境等。 钠还在身体控制血压和容量方面发挥作用[4]。另外，盐还参与了胃酸的形成，还是胰液、胆汁、汗水、泪水、血液的组成成分。\n可以说是人体健康是离不开盐的，而且这种“离不开”是不可替代的。\n糖是碳水化合物。 碳水化合物是人体的主要能量来源。但是即使不用糖做调味品，我们人体照样可以从很多其他食物中获得丰富的“碳水化合物”来为自己提供能量，比如含淀粉多的根茎类蔬菜，含果糖多的水果等等。因此我们经常听到说“戒糖”，但没听说过“戒盐”。\n3. 盐的可获得性高于糖\n盐取自于自然，主要是海水。我们的祖先很早就发现了食盐。 传说在炎帝时期，居住在山东半岛的夙沙氏，就发明了用海水制盐的法子。而这种制盐方法不需要太多器具，方法简单。\n大约8万年前，从事狩猎和采集活动的人类只能偶尔吃到季节限定的少量水果或者野生蜂蜜来获取“甜感”，还要跟鸟抢着吃。后来慢慢人类学会了自己提炼糖，但糖的制取比起盐难了很多很多。盐主要取之于海水，而糖的提炼主要来源是植物种子（提炼麦芽糖）、粮食和甘蔗等农作物，这就需要这些农作物有一定的储备才行，大家想下古代的农耕种植产量水准，就可以猜到，糖在很长一段历史中都是只有贵族和富人才能吃得起的“奢品”，更不用说奢侈的在烹饪中用糖来做调味品了。\n而且比起盐，糖不太容易保存。\n\n综上所述，这三个点可以大体解释了“人类的烹饪文化中，盐是主要调味品，而不是糖”。\n如果你感兴趣其他关于味觉感官和厨房原理的回答，这里还有一些我回答过其他有意思的问题：\n为什么捏住鼻子就不会尝到味道？\n你是明白了哪几个基本原理之后而厨艺大增的？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n卫小妖GOGOGO\n点击下载\n76 个回答，查看全部。\n有没有替代味精的天然调味品？\n有哪些值得推荐的调味品？",

          "description": "OpenBoard 是为中小学和大学定制的交互式开源白板。让我们来看看它提供了什么。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n有几个可用于教育的开源工具，但是，并非所有这些面向中小学和大学的软件都能达到商业软件级的良好维护。\n\r\nOpenBoard 就是这样一个不同凡响的自由开源工具，它可以不打折扣地为教育服务。它是一个交互式白板程序，具有所有基本功能，并支持各种硬件。\n\r\nOpenBoard：自由及开源的交互式白板\n\r\n\n\r\n作为一个自由开源的程序，OpenBoard 看起来是一个令人印象深刻的选择。\n\r\n瑞士日内瓦州的教育部门（DIP）与 GitHub 上的社区一起维护该工具。\n\r\n通过交互式白板促进简单的数字教学不应该花费很多，这就是 OpenBoard 的优势所在。\n\r\n它提供的一系列功能对大多数中小学和大学来说应该是足够的。\n\r\n虽然我无法在中小学/大学环境中测试它，但我会重点介绍它提供的主要功能。\n\r\nOpenBoard 的特点\n\r\n\n\r\n交互式白板没有众多花哨的功能，但足以使教师能够尽可能轻松地表达自己。\n\r\n我注意到的一些特点包括：\n\r\n\r\n跨平台支持\n\r\n能够自由地写写画画\n\r\n能够添加注释\n\r\n能够删除注释\n\r\n可以使用荧光笔高亮显示你的白板的部分区域\n\r\n单独互动和移动创建/绘制的项目\n\r\n按顺序添加多个页面，可以继续教学而不需要擦除\n\r\n能够在页面间滚动浏览\n\r\n绘制线条（从三种不同线宽中选择）\n\r\n切换手写笔模式（如果你使用的是手写板或类似的东西）\n\r\n轻松擦除在白板上创建的项目\n\r\n可以从一组不同的背景中选择，包括把它变成黑板或带网格线的背景\n\r\n各种必要的应用，包括计算器、地图、尺子等，都可以通过拖放使用\n\r\n提供的一些形状，可以使绘图更容易\n\r\n能够向你的白板添加音频/视频，并无缝播放，以获得更好的体验\n\r\n虚拟激光笔\n\r\n可放大和缩小\n\r\n书写文字，调整大小，并克隆它\n\r\n从白板中对屏幕进行截图\n\r\n需要时可使用虚拟键盘\n\r\n\r\n在我简短的测试中，用户界面和可用的选项工作得非常好，没有任何故障。\n\r\n\n\r\n当然，你的体验将取决于设备的类型和你的设置。你可以用 Wacom 平板、双显示器设置，或者通过支持触摸的笔记本电脑使用投影仪来尝试。\n\r\n在 Linux 中安装 OpenBoard\n\r\n更好的是，它可以在多个平台上使用，包括 Windows、macOS 和 Linux。\n\r\n如果你使用的是 Ubuntu，你可以到官方网站下载 DEB 文件。另外对于其他 Linux 发行版，你可以选择通过 Flathub 安装 Flatpak 软件包。\n\r\n\r\nOpenBoard\n\r\n\r\n结语\n\r\n总的来说，我发现它在使用和导航方面毫不费力。你可以在多个页面之间快速切换，无缝擦除/添加项目，同时还可以在白板上添加丰富的元素。\n\r\n通过虚拟激光笔以及一些应用，使得它适合在各种中小学和大学中使用而没有任何障碍。\n\r\n我不知道它是否可以被称为谷歌课堂或 Miro 白板功能的替代品，但对于更简单的使用，OpenBoard 可以胜任。\n\r\n如果你还没有试过，我建议你试一试。你知道有什么比这更好的东西吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/openboard/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Linux 有助于弥合数字鸿沟，延长硬件的使用寿命，使得它成为操作系统的一个环保选择。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n与大流行病作斗争，造成了生产新电脑所需的微芯片的短缺。此外，一些较新的专有操作系统提高了它们的硬件标准（LCTT 译注：Windows 11，别扭头看别人）。这个难题为我们这些在日常生活中使用 Linux 的人创造了一个机会。\n\r\n延长硬件的生命周期\n\r\n长期以来，Linux 一直以延长老旧硬件的寿命而闻名。这种能力对那些每天使用电脑的人来说是个福音。\n\r\n在过去的一年里，我已经帮助许多人使用 Linux 翻新和 改装旧电脑。基于 Linux 的电脑耗电更少，启动速度更快。Gnome 桌面很好，但许多旧电脑更适合 LXDE 或 XFCE 环境，它们运行需要较少的资源。\n\r\n像 FreeGeek 和 Kramden Institute 这样的组织已经把弥合数字鸿沟作为他们的核心使命，并以此为目标。这些团体对旧电脑进行了再利用，使它们不被当成垃圾填埋，而是把它们送到需要它们的用户手中。没有 Linux，就没有这些项目。\n\r\nDD-Wrt、OpenWrt 和 Tomato 都是 Linux 解决方案，使旧的网络硬件不被当成垃圾丢弃，并同时为用户的路由器提供更多的安全、隐私和性能。\n\r\n借助 GalliumOS 和 Mrchromebox.tech，即使是 Chromebooks 在谷歌停止支持后也能获得新的生命。\n\r\n新的机会\n\r\nLinux 创造了一些本来不存在的机会。学生和业余爱好者都在没有投资的情况下开始了计算机科学的成功事业，这要归功于他们在旧电脑上学到的经验。这些系统运行企业级软件，如 LAMP 栈，它促进了向 “Web 2.0” 的过渡。它是最早的 Web 开源软件栈之一。今天，它为 WordPress、Drupal 和 Joomla 系统提供了动力。事实上，Linux 为超过 96% 的世界前 100 万台 Web 服务器提供动力。Linux 还管理着 嵌入式系统、电子阅读器、智能电视、智能手表 等等。Linux 是世界上远远 超过 70% 的智能手机的操作系统。甚至美国国家航空航天局（NASA）今年在火星上创造历史的 毅力号，也是由 Linux 驱动的。\n\r\n为当今大多数应用提供动力的云计算，没有 Linux 就不可能存在。今天的大多数 Web 和智能手机应用都在基于 Linux 的 容器 中运行。即使在微芯片短缺和专有系统成本高昂的情况下，进入云服务行业的人也有机会学习开源的操作系统和软件。\n\r\n未来\n\r\n但最恰当的是，Linux 和开源为 联合国可持续发展目标 提供了动力。随着大流行的继续，Linux 仍然是一个重要的资源。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/linux-sustainable-os\n\r\n作者：Don Watkins 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "System76 分享了其即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的顶部面板草图。看起来令人惊叹！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nSystem76 令人兴奋的用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面的开发工作现在正在进行中。\n\r\n虽然我们已经用早期的代码 试过了，但我们现在可以看到更多的东西。从其 GitHub 仓库 和 Figma 文档 的一些原型中，我们可以看到它的更多信息。\n\r\n值得注意的是，我们可以看到顶部面板和系统托盘，正如你在 COSMIC 桌面上所期望的那样。\n\r\n这仍是一项正在进行的工作，可能会有变化。\n\r\nCOSMIC 桌面的顶部面板\n\r\nPop!_OS 依赖于 GNOME 扩展来通过顶部面板或系统托盘图标提供更多的功能。\n\r\n随着即将推出的使用 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面，看起来他们正在创建新的小程序，与当前的外观相融合，并提供更多的功能。\n\r\n开发者 Eduardo Flores 分解研究 了它，发现了关键的区别以及 System76 的目标是如何使其发挥作用。\n\r\n而且，这也是它更有趣的地方：\n\r\n\r\n看起来 System76 正在摆脱传统的“扩展”，计划为第三方小程序设计一个 API，这与 KDE、XFce 和其他公司的做法类似。\n\r\n这是一个令人兴奋的消息，将使 COSMIC 成为一个更强大的桌面环境，使其可以扩展和定制。\n\r\n\r\n另外，似乎这些小程序也可以和顶部面板一起放在坞站里。我们会在其未来的某个测试版中看到更多的实际情况。\n\r\n在这里，让我重点介绍一下从现有的草图中观察到的基本变化：\n\r\n1、声音小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n与我们现在所拥有的相比，COSMIC 的目标是增加细化的控制，如选择输入/输出设备、在顶部面板上切换媒体控制的选项、控制媒体播放，以及访问声音设置。\n\r\n虽然草图没有显示专辑封面，但在发布前会包括它。\n\r\n作为参考，以下是 Pop!_OS 顶部面板选项现在的样子。\n\r\n\n\r\n2、电源小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n很高兴看到有一个专门的电源按钮来快速访问系统设置、锁屏和注销。\n\r\n另外，暂停、重启和关机的按钮应该可以提高可用性，关闭计算机不用额外的点击。\n\r\n3、网络小程序\n\r\n虽然你可以很容易地打开或关闭有线、无线网络，但会弹出一个占据了整个屏幕的单独窗口来选择 Wi-Fi 网络并输入密码。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，看起来我们终于可以在这里输入密码，连接到可用的无线网络，并重试失败的连接，而不必从活动窗口分心。所有这些都发生在系统托盘上的网络小程序上，如上面的截图所示。\n\r\n同样，你可以看到关于你的有线连接的更多信息，包括 IP 地址和速度。\n\r\n4、日期、时间和日历小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n最重要的日历小程序看起来更加实用，信息量更大。通知区不再驻留在这里（它现在有一个单独的小程序），使它的体验更干净，可以把注意力放在你关注的东西上。\n\r\n一些细微的视觉改进，比如用重点颜色来突出日历中的某一行，应该会使它更容易理解。\n\r\n5、通知中心\n\r\n\n\r\n正如我前面提到的，通知现在有一个独立的空间。通知小程序会将所有的通知堆积起来，并允许你在需要时展开它们，或者将它们全部清除。\n\r\n我们仍然有“请勿打扰”开关，并可以快速访问通知设置。\n\r\n6、图形模式小程序\n\r\n\n\r\n这对笔记本电脑用户来说应该是非常有用的，可以在图形模式之间无缝切换，并可以看到当前使用的哪种模式。\n\r\n除了所有这些，还有一个蓝牙小程序、一个电池电源模式小程序，以及一些其他的东西，比如改变输入语言或输入源的能力。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n鉴于这是初次看到使用 Rust 开发 COSMIC 桌面顶部面板的外观，看来我们有很多东西要去看了。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n总的来说，System76 正准备为我们提供一个高度可定制但又简化的 COSMIC 桌面版本。\n\r\n而所有这些都应该有助于形成一种独特的桌面体验。当然，明年你就得在 Pop!_OS 中和 GNOME 说再见了。\n\r\n你怎么看？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/system76-cosmic-panel/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "KDE 开始 15 分钟错误消除计划\n\r\n该计划用于集中修复许多影响 KDE 桌面的低级错误，这些错误用户在 15 分钟或更短时间内就能发现。其列入标准是，这些错误受 KDE 的默认设置影响，100% 可重现，一些基本的东西不工作或看起来有视觉上的缺陷，可能导致崩溃，需要重启或终端命令来解决或没有解决方法，最近回退的错误，或有超过五个重复的错误报告。在该计划中，第一批 有 56 个错误需要处理。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这些不起眼而很重要的工作，才真正能将 KDE 打磨成主流桌面环境。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nOpera 发布专门的内置加密钱包的浏览器\n\r\nOpera 发布 了一个 Web3 Crypto 浏览器，内置加密货币钱包，更易于访问加密货币/NFT 交易所、去中心化应用 dApp 等。Opera 表示新浏览器旨在简化 Web3 用户体验。Web3 是基于区块链的去中心化互联网，是目前加密货币支持者最热衷的新事物。该浏览器的钱包支持包括以太坊、比特币等加密货币。不过，该浏览器在国内被禁止使用。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 Opera 逐渐从主流浏览器中落后，但是它专注于游戏、加密货币等领域的努力还是值得赞赏。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n因 5G 干扰，国际航空公司正在减少飞往美国的航班\n\r\n美国的移动电话公司正在推出的 5G 服务，使用频率在 3.7 至 3.98GHz 之间的无线电频谱，即所谓的 C 波段。国际航空业担心美国 5G 服务过于接近雷达高度计使用的频谱，也就是 4.2 至 4.4GHz 之间，因而正在减少飞往美国的航班。但国际航空业认为，欧洲没有面临同样的风险，在欧洲，5G 服务使用频率较慢的 3.4 至 3.8GHz 范围的频谱，和雷达高度仪使用的频谱之间有更大的缓冲区。此外，欧洲也限制了机场附近的 5G 天线的功率和角度，避免了对飞机的干扰。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：新技术带来的新挑战，不知道国内的 5G 情况如何。",

          "description": "POSIX，你肯定在各种在线论坛和文章中，听到过这个缩写，或读到过关于它的信息。程序员和系统开发人员似乎最关心这个问题。它听起来很神秘，虽然有很多关于这个主题的好资料，但一些讨论区（简洁是它们的特点）并没有详细说明它是什么，这可能会让人困扰。那么，POSIX 到底是什么？\n\r\n\n\r\nPOSIX 简介\n\r\n与其说 POSIX 是一个东西，不如说是一个标签。想象一下，有一个盒子，上面贴着标签：POSIX，而盒子里是一个标准。该标准由 POSIX 所关注的规则和指令集组成。POSIX 是可移植操作系统接口Portable Operating System Interface 的缩写。它是一个 IEEE 1003.1 标准，其定义了应用程序（以及命令行 Shell 和实用程序接口）和 UNIX 操作系统之间的语言接口。\n\r\n当 UNIX 程序从一个 UNIX 平台移植到另一个平台时，遵守该标准可以确保其兼容性。POSIX 主要关注的是 AT&T 的 System V UNIX 和 BSD UNIX 的特性。\n\r\n该标准必须阐明并遵循如何实现操作系统之间互操作性的目标的规则。POSIX 涵盖了以下内容：系统接口、命令和实用程序、网络文件访问，这里仅举几例（POSIX 的内容远不止这些）。\n\r\n为什么有 POSIX？\n\r\n一句话：可移植性。\n\r\n60 多年前，如果程序员想让他们的软件在一个以上的系统上运行，就必须完全重写代码。由于所涉及的费用，这种情况并不经常发生，但在 1960 年代中期，可移植性成为一种特性 —— 不是通过 POSIX，而是在大型机领域。\n\r\nIBM 推出了 System/360 系列的大型计算机。不同的型号有其独特的规范，但硬件使得它们可以使用同一个操作系统：OS/360。\n\r\n不仅操作系统可以在不同的型号上运行，应用程序也可以在它们上面运行。这不仅降低了成本，而…",

          "description": "为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。\n我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。\n为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。\n短信转发至 iPhone 效果\n在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App\n🔗 下载地址：App Store\nBark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 > Bark 服务端 > 苹果 APNs 服务器 > 你的设备 > Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。\n第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。\nBark App\n在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder\n🔗 下载地址：酷安\nSmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。\n打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。\n将Bark设置为发送通道\n返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。\n设置短信转发规则\n除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。\n为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️\n出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。\n示例：realme UI 后台权限设置\n出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。\nrealme UI 验证码安全保护\n将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac\n根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。\n总结\n得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。\n如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n扫码分享",

          "description": "TongTX: “下午 2-3 点我需要占用测试环境联调项目，大家不要发布喔！”\n看到群里的消息我内心一阵苦恼，由于公司使用的是微服务架构并将其部署在了 Kubernetes 集群上，因此团队负责开发的服务是整个微服务架构其中的一环，整个系统的正常运行需要依赖微服务系统中的上下游服务，这导致每每到了发新版本的窗口期，大家都开始占用测试环境联调测试自己开发的功能，导致排队使用测试环境的情况。\n今天是发版日，我也需要将自己的功能发布至测试环境验证功能是否正确，有人占用测试环境的话会导致我无法随意测试与修复功能，排队使用测试环境会影响我的发布效率，到时候又要被产品经理吐槽上线慢了:(\n“那我安排在 3-4 点” 团队里另一名工程师在群里说。\n看到测试环境的使用时间不断被挤压，我也顾不上是否需真要用一个小时，赶紧在群里喊“我预期 5 点开 PR 合并代码，所以 4-5 点我要测试一下，用好了会通知大家。”\n想必各位使用微服务架构的同仁和我有一样的困扰，那就是“集成测试联调真的太他丫讨厌了！”，尤其一到发新版本的窗口期，测试环境简直犹如网红餐厅，大排长龙，各个功能都要测，只能乖乖等。很多公司和我在的这家企业一样，只有一套测试环境，一到发版前各个项目时间都很紧，全挤一起。尤其现在敏捷开发迭代周期越来越短，测试也越来越频繁，测试环境着实是不够用啊。\n于是我去找了找目前有没有能解决这个问题的方案，发现有一些工具链可以解决这个排队耗时问题，比如 TeamCode( https://www.teamcode.com)新推出的微服务集成测试工具 KubeOrbit( https://www.kubeorbit.io)，帮助团队高效测试微服务。\n我打开他发来的产品文档，发现此工具允许我在公司测试环境的 Kubernetes 集群中定义基准环境：\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment version=base\n我还可以基于基准环境创建不同的测试通道，比如测试环境 1 和测试环境 2：\n# Create a test env with name v1\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version=v1\n# Create a test env with name v2\n$ kubectl label deployment your-deployment-v1 version=v2\n将自己的服务加入目标测试环境\napiVersion: network.kubeorbit.io/v1alpha1\nkind: ServiceRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: serviceroute-sample\n  namespace: sample-namespace\nspec:\n  name: pod-svc\n  # Add your service to the test env named with v1 by defining trafficRoutes\n  trafficRoutes:\n    routes:\n      - name: v1\n        labels:\n          version: v1\n        headers:\n          version:\n            exact: v1\n    default:\n      version: base\n部署到目标测试环境中   \nkubectl apply -f /path/to/your/serviceroute.yaml\n使用体验总结\nKubeOrbit 工具主要有如下三种功能：在微服务测试环境内创建测试通道，这样就可以获得一个单独稳定的集成测试环境；把需要测试的微服务添加至测试通道中，将它们与其他不同版本的微服务隔离开来；在发起微服务请求的时候指定测试通道，KubeOrbit 会将其转发至你所指定的测试通道。这些功能刚好解决了我和团队耗时排队测试的困境，满足了团队测试的需求：\n1. 团队内部并行开发与联调测试的需求，大家无需再争抢使用测试环境\n2. 按时交付项目的需求，避免了因为测试环境不够导致项目延期的情况\n无需调整已有的技术栈和架构，KubeOrbit 会适配现有的微服务，还能够隔离不同测试通道之间的通讯。但是在产品的使用过程中，我发现还需要有较多的人工操作，增加了这个工具的使用门槛。如果能够把这些流程自动化，会给用户体验带来较大幅度的提升。刚好从公众号得知产品在 GitHub （ https://github.com/teamcode-inc/kubeorbit ）全部开源的消息，我也打算好好研究一下，持续关注这个项目和平台，希望未来有更好的体验。",
