Having all the latest features and a responsive design that is compatible across browsers improves the search engine ranking of a website, resulting in growth of audience. However, when the project is huge, developers often fail to adhere to the best UI practices. Thereby resulting in a website where some important functionality is not working or one where cross browser testing is not entirely performed. Here, we shall discuss the 17 reasons that lead to UI design failure for a website and certain UI design tips to avoid those setbacks.\nToday, all organizations are following the mobile first approach.

          "description": "In this post let's talk about the paradigm shift from lifecycle methods to state synchronization and hooks in ReactJs.\nHere is a video version of this post, if that's what you prefer. \n\n\n\n\nWhen class components were a thing in ReactJs (Well it still is, but no one likes them anymore), we use to think a lot in terms of mouting, unmounting, and lifecycle methods.\n\nWhenever a class component mounts, the lifecycle methods are called in following sequence: constructor → render → DOM and refs update → componentDidMount\nBut then came React Hooks, and we started to think in terms of dependency array.\nAnd, often times we ask:\nWhat is the hooks equivalent to [some lifecycle method]?\nThe quick answer is that hooks are a paradigm shift from thinking in terms of \"lifecycles\" to thinking in terms of \"state and synchronization with DOM\". Trying to take the old paradigm and apply it to hooks just doesn't work out very well and can hold you back.\nuseEffect(fn) // fn invoked on all updates\n\nuseEffect(fn, []) // invoked on mount\n\nuseEffect(fn, [a, b, c]) // invoked if any of the members of the array are updated\n\nThe above snippet is not the right way to think about React hook.\nLifecycles are gone, but we still think of useEffect with empty dep array as componentDidMount, and that’s not the right way to think about React Hooks.\nNow I want to present to you the right way to think about react hooks.\nSee, the question is not \"when does this effect run\" the question is \"which state does this effect synchronizes with\"\nuseEffect(fn) // useEffect with no dep array, sync with all state\n\nuseEffect(fn, []) // useEffect with empty dep array, sync with no state\n\nuseEffect(fn, [stateA, stateB]) // useEffect with stateA and stateB in dep array sync with stateA and stateB.\n\nAnd that’s how you should think about React Hooks.\nHope, you found this video useful, and if so, make sure show your support by subscribing.\nI also run a weekly newsletter, so you can join me there also: https://www.getrevue.co/profile/8020lessons\nThank You!",

You could’ve been a hacker if you tinkered with hardware. If you found new ways to perform art, you could also be a hacker. It’s all about the mindset and not about the tools.\nThe core concept of this culture was in trying and failing and trying again — while sharing the knowledge with your fellow hackers so they can build upon your mistakes.\nNowadays, the word “hacker” is used negatively, portrayed by the media as villains who rob banks and spread ransomware.

          "description": "Originally posted on the MetalBear blog.\n\n\nImagine you’re a backend developer at post series B SaaS soonicorn. You’ve spent half a sprint adding a new feature to your microservice. You’ve thoroughly researched possible inputs and database states and built an elaborate test suite. Your code was mercilessly reviewed by two of your teammates. Finally, the tests pass, the pull request is approved, and as a final verification, you deploy your new code to the staging environment…\nWhere it crashes almost immediately. Turns out you forgot to test some obscure configuration, or some complex database state that would only ever occur on a mature, complex environment - like staging, and unlike your local machine.\nThe worst part being that you know it’s going to happen again next sprint.\nI’ve encountered some variation of the dev loop at every startup I’ve ever worked in, and it’s this pain exactly that we’re trying to solve with mirrord. mirrord runs in two places - on your local development machine, and in your staging environment. By wrapping your local process and hooking system calls, it lets you plug your process non-invasively into that service’s instance on the staging environment. \n \nToday we’re releasing mirrord 2.0, which supports incoming traffic. That means whatever traffic reaches your service in staging is duplicated by mirrord and sent to your local process. We’ll soon be adding support for outgoing traffic, file access, and environment variables - everything needed for your local process to “think” it’s running on the staging environment.\n1. You can use it as either a CLI tool, or an extension for VS Code (IntelliJ support is on the way). Try it out here, and let us know what you think at hi@metalbear.co, or in our repo!\nnote that mirrord doesn’t install anything persistent in your Kubernetes cluster. It runs a job that self-deletes when mirrord terminates. ↩",

You are always in charge as a developer.\nChange to the developer experience can be brought about by bringing in more intelligent systems. \nExisting engineers will be able to be more productive, reduce manual tasks and focus on interesting work.\nGitHub Copilot has the potential to lower barriers to entry and allow more people to explore software development and join the next generation of developers.\nIn order to generate suggestions, you must transmit part of the file you are editing to the service. \nThis context is used to make suggestions. The suggestions are recorded on the Copilot. \nThis data is used to improve future versions of the system so that Copilot can make better suggestions for users in the future.

But as the application grows, it is almost always certain that most components deep in the tree will require data from parent/top in the tree components. As such, using props will make the whole app cumbersome. For example,\n<App>\n  <Header postsLength={posts.length} /> {/* assuming the header requires the length of the post */}\n    <PostsList posts={posts}>\n   <PostItem post={post}>\n\nIf the PostItem should require any new data from the parent component, you'd have to pass the data as props to every single component in-between.

Let's say you simply want to print \"Hello World\" to the screen. To do so, some beginners might create a new file, write \"Hello world\" to it and then use the cat command to print the contents of the file. Some experienced users may use the echo command to print the same to the screen. Both of them are correct as the job is done perfectly but the only difference is that using the echo command, we can accomplish the job quickly.\nIn this blog, we are going to discuss about one such function of creating a new user using two commands adduser and useradd.

          "description": "When working on accessibility, a common issue you might come across is that your HTML tag doesn't have a lang attribute.\nThe lang attribute tells the user which language the page is written in.\nSome examples of valid lang attributes are:\n<!-- French content -->\n<html lang=\"fr\"></html>\n\nNote: Find all languages codes here.\nWe can also extend the use-case to define specific versions of a language, for instance, British English.\n<html lang=\"en-gb\"></html>\n\nIn any regular plain HTML website, we would add this tag to the HTML element. However, in the case of Next.js, we don't have direct access to it.\nSo to add this tag, we need to use the next.config.js file.\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n};\n\nIf your website supports multiple languages, you can even put various values in the locales array.\nThe default locales are then used to set the current one.\nYou can even use this config to set up custom domains, but we might dive into that separately.\nThere is an alternative way of adding a custom HTML tag if you want to override multiple HTML properties.\nInside your pages directory, you can add a _document.js file.\nThis page will override the default Next.js document.\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang='en'>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  );\n}\n\nAnd that's it, two different ways of adding the lang tag in Next.js.\nThank you for reading my blog.

Fast forward to today and you can do much more with JavaScript. When companies started adopting JavaScript, a standard document called ECMAScript standard was written by ECMA International organization to maintain a standard in the language. Theoretically JavaScript can also be called as ECMAScript.\nToday, JavaScript is not limited to the browser, you can write JavaScript on any device that has a JavaScript engine (A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code) Some of the popular JavaScript engines are\nV8 - used in chrome, Microsoft edge, Opera, Node.js etc.\nJavaScript for the browser\nPHP for web server\nSwift for IOS applications\netc.\nWith introduction of Node.js, JavaScript become a backend language as well. Node.js was built on top the v8 engine which already supported JavaScript. What makes Node.js standout is it's non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient, Node.js can asynchronously continue executing code while listening for other events.\nIf you are someone new to the world of programming, you could build full stack web applications with the knowledge of one language. Also front-end developers who primarily use JavaScript can work on the backend without learning a new language.\nFinally I want to leave this famous quote by Jeff Attwood also known as the Atwood's Law.\nAtwood's Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript",

Other developers use various cloud platforms so that they don’t need to worry about security logic, and these platforms help developers with most secure ways of authenticating users.\nWe are going to see how you can use Firebase auth service to secure your react APP.\nFirst you will need to set up our own Firebase project through the Firebase Console. To get started, navigate your browser to Firebase Console. Make sure you are logged into your Google account.\nNow, click on Add project and follow the simple instructions provided. Once presented with a dashboard, click on Authentication on the sidebar and click on Get Started to enable the module. Now you will be presented with various authentication options. Click on Email/Password, enable it, and save it. We will come back later, let create our react app first.\nNavigate to your terminal and use npx create-react-app appname to create a new react app.\nnpm install firebase react-router-dom react-firebase-hooks \nNow lets go back to the Firebase Console dashboard, click on Project Settings. Click on the third icon (</>) to configure our Firebase project for the web. Here you will see a config file. Copy the config. Create a new file in the src folder named firebase.js, import firebase modules, and paste the config file here.\nWith this on your react app you can now start to create login and signup forms and use the firebase authentication module.",

More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.\nWhen it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge.

          "description": "what should I know before learning Java\n\n\nWell, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)\n\nI am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. \nIf you are a beginner, please don't use any kind of IDE.\n IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. \nIt is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. \nAs using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. \nSo you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. \nThis learning method is slow but very effective. \nAlthough you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. \nYou can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.💯",

It also highlights the line with different colors to help you better visualize and differentiate between errors, warnings and other messages!\n\nWith this extension, you can search for relevant CSS files by using CSS classes in html file and edit CSS files there itself! Here's how it works:\n\nGitLens is a powerful extension which can display when a particular line was committed, by whom it was committed and in which pull request it was included along with the commit message! All of this information is inline with the line upon which your cursor is currently located.\nYou can also hover over the message to get even more information about a particular line of code!\n\n\nThere are many more features in GitLens which you can explore and play around with!\nImport Cost allows us to see the size of the imported package inline in the editor itself!\n\nVersion Lens fetches information about dependency versions and displays it on top of the package!\n\nThese were the 5 VSCode extensions which are powerful, useful and can improve your productivity and workflow!\nSigning off.\nTwitter | GitHub | LinkedIn",

          "description": "了解使用数组和切片在 Go 中存储数据的优缺点，以及为什么其中一个更好。\n\r\n\r\n在本系列的第四篇文章中，我将解释 Go 数组和切片，包括如何使用它们，以及为什么你通常要选择其中一个而不是另一个。\n\r\n数组\n\r\n数组是编程语言中最流行的数据结构之一，主要原因有两个：一是简单易懂，二是可以存储许多不同类型的数据。\n\r\n你可以声明一个名为 anArray 的 Go 数组，该数组存储四个整数，如下所示：\n\r\nanArray := [4]int{-1, 2, 0, -4}\r\n\n\r\n数组的大小应该在它的类型之前声明，而类型应该在声明元素之前定义。len() 函数可以帮助你得到任何数组的长度。上面数组的大小是 4。\n\r\n如果你熟悉其他编程语言，你可能会尝试使用 for 循环来遍历数组。Go 当然也支持 for 循环，不过，正如你将在下面看到的，Go 的 range 关键字可以让你更优雅地遍历数组或切片。\n\r\n最后，你也可以定义一个二维数组，如下：\n\r\ntwoD := [3][3]int{\r\n  {1, 2, 3},\r\n  {6, 7, 8},\r\n  {10, 11, 12}}\r\n\n\r\narrays.go 源文件中包含了 Go 数组的示例代码。其中最重要的部分是：\n\r\nfor i := 0; i < len(twoD); i++ {\r\n  k := twoD\r\n  for j := 0; j < len(k); j++ {\r\n    fmt.Print(k[j], \" \")\r\n  }\r\n  fmt.Println()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor _, a := range twoD {\r\n  for _, j := range a {\r\n    fmt.Print(j, \" \")\r\n  }\r\n  fmt.Println()\r\n}\r\n\n\r\n通过上述代码，我们知道了如何使用 for 循环和 rang…",

          "description": "为纪念全球无障碍意识日，让我们了解一下 NVDA 开源屏幕阅读器，以及你该如何参与其中，为所有网络用户提高无障碍性。\n\r\n\r\n屏幕阅读器是辅助技术软件的一个专门领域，它可以阅读并说出计算机屏幕上的内容。完全没有视力的人只是视力障碍者的一小部分，屏幕阅读器软件可以帮助所有群体。屏幕阅读器大多特定于操作系统，供有视觉障碍的人和无障碍培训师使用，以及想要测试网站或应用的无障碍访问程度的开发人员和无障碍顾问。\n\r\n如何使用 NVDA 屏幕阅读器\n\r\nWebAIM 屏幕阅读器用户调查 始于 2009 年，一直持续到 2021 年。在第一次调查中，最常用的屏幕阅读器是 JAWS，占 74%。它是微软 Windows 的商业产品，并且是长期的市场领导者。NVDA 当时是一个相对较新的 Windows 开源屏幕阅读器，仅占 8%。快进到 2021 年，JAWS 占 53.7%，NVDA 占 30.7%。\n\r\n你可以从 NVAccess 网站 下载最新版本的 NVDA。为什么我要使用 NVDA 并将它推荐给我使用微软 Windows 的客户？嗯，它是开源的、速度快、功能强大、易于安装、支持多种语言、可以作为便携式应用运行、拥有庞大的用户群，并且有定期发布新版本的周期。\n\r\nNVDA 已被翻译成 55 种语言，并在 175 个不同的国家/地区使用。还有一个活跃的开发者社区，拥有自己的 社区插件网站。你选择安装的任何附加组件都将取决于你的需求，并且有很多可供选择，包括常见视频会议平台的扩展。\n\r\n与所有屏幕阅读器一样，NVDA 有很多组合键需要学习。熟练使用任何屏幕阅读器都需要培训和练习。\n\r\n\n\r\n向熟悉计算机和会使用键盘的人教授 NVDA 并不太难。向一个完全初学者教授基本的计算机技能（没有鼠标、触摸板和键盘技能）和使用 NVDA 是一个更大的挑战。个人的学习方式和偏好不同。此外，如果人们只想浏览网页和使用电子邮件，他们可能不需要学习如何做所有事情。NVDA 教程和资源的一个很好的链接来源是 无障碍中心。\n\r\n当你掌握了使用键盘命令操作 NVDA，它就会变得更容易，但是还有一个菜单驱动的系统可以完成许多配置任务。\n\r\n\n\r\n测试无障碍性\n\r\n多年来，屏幕阅读器用户无法访问某些网站一直是个问题，尽管美国残疾人法案（ADA）等残疾人平等立法仍然存在。NVDA 在有视力的社区中的一个很好的用途是用于网站无障碍性测试。NVDA 可以免费下载，并且通过运行便携式版本，网站开发人员甚至不需要安装它。运行 NVDA，关闭显示器或闭上眼睛，看看你在浏览网站或应用时的表现如何。\n\r\nNVDA 也可用于测试（通常被忽略的）正确 标记 PDF 文档以实现无障碍性 任务。\n\r\n有几个指南专注于使用 NVDA 进行无障碍性测试。我可以推荐 使用 NVDA 测试网页 和使用 NVDA 评估 Web 无障碍性。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/5/open-source-screen-reader-windows-nvda\n\r\n作者：Peter Cheer 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "开源的无头Headless内容管理系统（CMS）列表中添加了一个新选项。它会是一个更好的无头 WordPress 替代品吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n自从一年多前发布首个测试版以来，作为无头内容管理系统（CMS），Payload 已经逐渐在 Web 开发社区中给人们留下了深刻印象。先做一些背景介绍，Payload 是专门为更简单地开发网站、Web 应用或原生native应用而量身定制的内容管理系统。\n\r\n最近，他们决定完全开源，现在，它已跻身 可用的最佳开源内容管理系统 之一。\n\r\n然而，这也带来了一些问题：他们会采用怎么样的商业模式？Payload 内容管理系统的计划是什么？下面，就让我们简要地看一下吧！\n\r\nPayload 为什么要开源？\n\r\n自 2021 年首次发布以来，Payload 已经收到了来自开源社区的许多贡献。正如 Payload 在他们 最近的公告 中所说，开源是一个重要的决定，它能够使项目能够达到的更高的高度，这是闭门造车做不到的。\n\r\n\n\r\n此外，这种开放性通常会增加开发者社区的信任。这种信任也会延伸到商业，自然而然地转而成为开发者最支持、最信任的平台。\n\r\n因此，Payload 正在切换到 MIT 许可证。这将允许任何人免费且不受限制地修改、分发和使用 Payload。\n\r\n然而，Payload 仍然需要资金流入才能持续运营。那么，这就引出了一个问题，Payload 将如何盈利呢？\n\r\nPayload 将如何盈利?\n\r\n与往常一样，Payload 需要一些财务支持才能维持运营。团队拿出了一个由两部分组成的计划，该计划既要为用户提供更多 以便利为中心convenience-focused的功能，又要为 自托管self-hosted 客户提供难以置信的灵活性。\n\r\n\n\r\n企业许可证\n\r\n此选项与其他开源 CMS 的软件服务极为相似。这些许可证将提供更高级的 SSO 选项，并为开发者保证 Payload 核心团队的响应时间。\n\r\n这些许可证应该对大公司有吸引力，尤其是那些需要最大程度可靠性的公司。\n\r\n云主机\n\r\n这个选项非常有吸引力，因为它结合了多种服务来创造最方便的体验。尽管传统托管仍然相当容易，但只要你为 Node 应用程序添加数据库、持久文件存储和其他基础设施，你就会面对四五个不同的服务，而这些服务都需要无缝协同工作。\n\r\n应该注意的是，这不是必需的，Payload 仍然鼓励用户托管他们的实例。这项服务只是消除了与托管相关的大量费用和挑战而已。\n\r\n截至目前，事情还没有敲定。但是，你可以关注 GitHub 上的讨论来跟踪事情的进展。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n作为一个新兴的 CMS 选项，很高兴看到 Payload 迈出了这一步，成为 WordPress 和其他选项的流行替代品。此外，在我看来，Payload 团队对他们的新业务模式充满信心，或许这预示着一个光明的未来（希望如此）。\n\r\n\r\nPayload 内容管理系统\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/payload-open-source/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Tails 5.1 将针对“可绕过 Tor 浏览器安全措施的危险漏洞”提供关键修复。以下是它的全部内容。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nTails 是一个专注于安全的便携式 Linux 发行版，最近，它的开发团队发布了有关其当前版本的重要公告。他们警告用户在 Tails 5.0 或更早版本 上使用 Tor 浏览器时，避免输入或使用任何个人或敏感信息。\n\r\nTor 浏览器是 Tails 事实上的（默认）网页浏览器，它有助于在用户连接到互联网时，保护他们的在线身份。它主要被各种记者和活动家用来逃避审查。不过，普通用户也可以使用它。\n\r\n问题说明\n\r\n最近，有人发现了两个令人讨厌的漏洞，它们允许有害网站能够从其他网站窃取用户的信息。\n\r\n这些都是在 Firefox 使用的 JavaScript 引擎中发现的。\n\r\n但是，Tor 与此有什么关系？对于那些不知道的人来说，Tor 实际上是 Firefox 的一个复刻，因此包含许多类似的功能，如 JavaScript 引擎。\n\r\n具体来说，在 Mozilla 发布的公告 中，这些漏洞已被确定为 CVE-2022-1802 和 CVE-2022-1529。\n\r\nTails 公告中也对此进行了说明：\n\r\n\r\n“例如，在你访问恶意网站后，控制该网站的攻击者可能会在同一个 Tails 会话期间，访问你随后发送到其他网站的密码或其他敏感信息。”\n\r\n\r\n你应该停止使用 Tail 发行版吗？\n\r\n没有这个必要。\n\r\n用户会很高兴地知道，这些漏洞并不影响 Tor 的连接。这意味着，如果你不交换任何敏感信息，如密码、个人信息、信息等，你可以随意地浏览互联网。\n\r\nTails 中的其他应用程序，尤其是 Thunderbird，仍然可以安全使用，因为 JavaScript 在使用时会被禁用。\n\r\n此外，你也可以在 Tor 浏览器中启用最高的安全级别。这是推荐的，因为（该级别下）JavaScript 引擎会被禁用。不过，请注意，这会使网站无法正常运行。\n\r\n换句话说，如果你知道自己在做什么的话，Tails 发行版仍然可以安全使用。\n\r\n漏洞修复即将发布\n\r\n好的消息是，Mozilla 已经在上游修补了这些错误，现在就等 Tails 团队发布修复程序了。\n\r\n至于何时发布，他们是这样说的：\n\r\n\r\n此漏洞将在 Tails 5.1（5 月 31 日）中修复，但我们的团队没有能力提前发布紧急版本。\n\r\n\r\n因此，你最好的选择是等待下周的 Tails 5.1 发布。你可以阅读 Tails 开发团队的 官方公告 以了解更多信息。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/tails-tor-browser/\n\r\n作者：Rishabh Moharir 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "经历了长达两个月的居家隔离，上海朋友们终于可以不用吃“蛤蜊炖蛋”（上海话“隔离等待”的谐音）。解封、允许外出的小区越来越多，在超市、医院甚至进入小区都要出示“随申码”，这个时候出示健康码的速度就成了避免人群积压的重要因素。那么本文将会给出我的两个方案。\n来源：Unsplash\n 方案一、快捷指令\n快捷指令打开健康码已经不是什么新鲜事了，这里也不多赘述。但我更加推荐下载“随申办”，它自带两个快捷指令：“随申码”和“扫一扫”，相较于支付宝的快捷指令，“随申办”App提供的快捷指令无需应用内跳转、速度更快，“秒开”buff加满。\n“快捷指令”中“随申办”App提供的数个功能\nPS：建议下载应用后，进入App内“设置”-“通用”-关闭“启动动画”。\n\n方案二、利用“核酸码”制作Wallet钱包凭证\nWallet钱包想必是除iTunes Store以外各位大陆iPhone用户第二少使用的自带应用。但是，假如我们将“随申码”放进钱包后，它就不仅仅是一个刷交通卡、Apple Pay时才会想到的App。此外，双击电源键即可打开也是原生App的一大优势。\n众所周知，全国大多数健康码都是实时刷新的，这样增加了安全性，但是也要求使用时一定需要用户联网等要求，限制了使用场景，于是乎上海市市政府在去年10月推出离线随申码功能1，针对的是60岁以上老人、有残疾证的上海户籍市民以及18岁以下的未成年人。只需要去街道社区服务中心、银行等配备“一网通办”综合自助终端的服务点，凭身份证即可领取为期180天的“随申码”卡片，以便弱势群体在线下场景减少不会用手机的“痛苦”。\n在本轮疫情期间，为了便于社区进行核酸筛查，“随申办”推出了“核酸码”功能——有效期为一个月的静态核酸登记用二维码。但在自己本人的测试下，扫描后会显示“离线随申码”的字样。以此可以判断出，其实上海市大数据中心允许每个人都有“离线随申码”，但它只是披上了“核酸码”的外衣。于是它静态的特性也方便我们采用不同的方法。\n\n接下来我会讲述如何制作Wallet凭证：\n下载Pass2U；\n \n \n 在“票卡商店”中搜索“离线随申码”，就可以找到相应的模版（或者自己做）；\n\n \n将核酸码的截图上传，并填入自己的姓名、核酸码有效期等信息；\n一定要将“显示”选项关闭，否则二维码的内容会显示在其下方。\n点击“完成”。\n制作出来的Wallet凭证\n到这一步，你就可以优雅出示随申码了！\n\n进阶（下篇文章细讲）\n我制作的凭证\n这是我使用MakePass做出的Wallet凭证。如果对外观、功能等有更高要求的话，可以使用MakePass制作，不过这价格嘛～ 慎重考虑。",

          "description": "一切都要从“书号”开始说起。\n关于书号，在此引用百度百科的定义：\n\n书号即ISBN，最直观的就是书的封底的条型码和那一串数字。是由中华人民共和国新闻出版总署分配给各个出版社的。国内的书号还在书的第二页（一般在扉页的反面）配有CIP数据，该页也称为版权页。这二者是在国内出版图书不可缺少的两个必要数据。\n《乔布斯传》版权页\n根据相关规定，书号由新闻出版总署分配给各个出版社，每年有一定配额，个人和民营企业无法申请书号。\n简单来说，出版社是国企，每年从新闻出版总署那领到一定数量的书号资源，只有他们才有资格出版图书。知名的出版社有人民文学出版社、中信出版社、上海译文出版社等，他们经济效益好，出版图书多，书号紧俏。但另一些出版社，由于能力有限，图书出版数量不多，有书号闲余。\n图书出版市场除了出版社，还有出版公司，他们有优秀的书籍策划能力和众多的图书版权资源，但由于是民营企业，没有书号申请资质，于是，出版公司便与有书号闲余的出版社合作，由出版公司编辑策划发行，出版社提供书号，负责审核，出版。一家出版社的书号可能有多家出版公司在使用，一家出版公司也会同时使用多家出版社书号。优秀的出版公司也有很多，例如新经典、果麦、磨铁、读客等。\n除了出版社和出版公司，还有一个概念是图书品牌。有的出版公司或出版社自身的名字即为图书品牌，比如新经典文化的“新经典”、磨铁文化的“磨铁”、读库文化的“读库”，人民文学出版社、三联书店等；有的图书品牌则是出版公司或出版社的子品牌，比如译林出版社旗下的“方尖碑”品牌、社会科学文献出版社旗下的“甲骨文”品牌、广西师范大学出版社直属机构北京贝贝特出版顾问旗下的“理想国”品牌。\n以上就是关于出版社、出版公司和出版品牌三者之间的联系。不同出版社和出版公司因为自身发展原因，会侧重不同的方向，形成自己的优势领域，比如中信出版社的经济管理类书籍、新星的推理小说、上海译文出版社的外国…",

Logitech MX Master 3\n4. Logitech G502\n键盘：\na. Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nb. HHKB Pro Hybrid Type S\nc. Logitech ERGO K860\n电脑：\n主要使用 M1 Mini ，有时需要切换成 PC\nTL;DR\n最终选择方案：1(2) + b + 4\n经过亲身体验，键盘还是 HHKB 的手感最好，不忍割舍。左手可以搭配 Trackball 或者垫高的 Trackpad 来用最小的手部移动满足基础的指针需求，然后在需要更精准点击以及大量拖拽时可以使用右手的鼠标，考虑到右手的使用场景更少然后 Master3 有时会出现断连 /延迟 /滚轮方向不正确等问题，我选择了更稳定的有线方案 G502 。在需要切换桌面时，HHKB 和 Trackball 可以切换蓝牙，Trackpad 可以通过有线 /蓝牙来切换，右手 G502 就没办法了。\n推荐组合：\n组合一：1 + a + 4\nPROS:\n最原生的 M1 键鼠组合，基本需求一步到位，续航完美，有线可以减少延迟，touchID 极大提升输密码环节的使用体验，trackpad 的手势不必多说，用习惯了就离不开了,右手选择最稳定的 G502 。\nCONS:\n键盘敲击手感一般，手腕无法垫高失去保护，长时间使用不舒服。多桌面支持不佳，只能用蓝牙 /有线来每次进行手动切换。\n组合二：2 + b + 4\nPROS：\n最适合 VIM 用户的组合，键盘不必多说，手感 /布局都是精心设计，长期码字手感顺滑，配上统一高度并且能最小移动手部的 Trackball ，可以在需要精准指针操作的时候最大程度减少撕裂感。两者都支持多平台，HHKB 可以通过有线 /多个蓝牙，Trackball 可以通过接收器 /蓝牙来进行切换。\nCONS：\nHHKB 如果不是有线连接的话无法唤醒 MAC ，KENSINGTON 的接收器十分不稳定，经常断连，使用蓝牙的话延迟严重。\n组合三：（ 2 ） + c + 3\nPROS：\n罗技工程学组合，一个接收器可以让键鼠同时丝滑使用，K860 的分离式设计和碗托的设计让人爱不释手，Master3 和 Mac 的适配也很完美。两者都支持多桌面，不过由于 K860 不支持 flow ，所以还是需要手动点击切换，不过相比起其他组合已经是最快捷的桌面切换方式了。\nCONS：\nLOGI OPTIONS 垃圾，K860 的敲击感一般，而且带小键盘导致右手鼠标必须离远使用，因为 Master3 并不适配左手。替代方案是左手使用 Trackpad 或者 Trackball ，考虑到键盘高度，Trackball 最适配。\n以上只是个人的使用体验，每个人都有适合自己的搭配，我比较爱折腾所以给大家一些参考，欢迎大家给出自己的方案。",

          "description": "theme: v-green\nhighlight: atom-one-dark\n我正在参加「初夏创意投稿大赛」详情请看：初夏创意投稿大赛\n前言\n上一篇我们通过Listener获取触控点的位置作为贝塞尔曲线的控制点，实现曲线的交互式绘制。不过，上一篇有个缺陷，控制点绘制完成后只能撤销，没法修改，如果要调整绘制的图形的话会非常麻烦，这一篇我们来实现控制点的拖拽式移动，动态调整位置来调整绘制的图形。\n实现逻辑\n上一篇的主要代码我们不做更改，主要是需要实现控制点的拖拽式移动，移动过程中动态绘制新的曲线。不过由于绘制过程中不能同时移动点，因此需要有个完成绘制的控制，完成绘制后才支持拖拽控制点。拖拽控制点实现这里有两个主要逻辑：\n控制点的命中判断：即拖拽开始时判断哪个控制点被命中，需要移动。\n监听触控位置的移动过程：移动过程中动态绘制新的图形，以便直接看到对应的效果。\n控制点的命中判断在完成绘制后，首先需要监听触控按下事件，看看触控点是否覆盖了某个控制点的触控响应范围，同时对于距离较近的点，可能会同时命中多个点的触控响应范围，这个时候需要取距离最近的那个点。对于触控范围，我们定义为每个触控点的周边10个像素点。命中触控点的实现代码如下：\nint checkPointToMove(Offset pressedPoint) {\n    // 控制点非空才查找\n    if (points.isNotEmpty) {\n      var pointsToCheck = [];\n      final maxDistance = 10.0;\n      // 查找触控响应范围内的控制点\n      for (Offset p in points) {\n        if ((p.dx - pressedPoint.dx).abs() \n移动过程的处理就比较简单了，我们已经找到了命中的控制点，那就在触控位置移动监听响应方法onPointerMove中更新控制点位置，并重新绘制即可，代码如下，其中indexOfPointToMove是一个状态变量，即找到的控制点下标：\nonPointerMove: ((event) {\n  if (indexOfPointToMove != -1) {\n    points[indexOfPointToMove] = event.localPosition;\n    setState(() {});\n  }\n}),\n\n应用\n逻辑完成了，我们就来做一个绘制应用吧。考虑端午节快到了，我们尝试来绘制一个粽子的线条画看看。下面是调整前后的对比效果以及调整过程的动图，可以看到，调整后的还是更像粽子一些。\n\n\n总结\n本篇介绍了如何通过拖拽调整贝塞尔曲线绘制的控制点来调整图形的绘制，实际上很多绘图都可能用到拖拽式的控制点位的调整，比如电子围栏的设置。实际上主要的代码是判断触控位置命中了具体哪个控制点。本篇代码已经上传至：绘图相关代码。\n我是岛上码农，微信公众号同名，这是Flutter 入门与实战的专栏文章，提供体系化的 Flutter 学习文章。对应源码请看这里：Flutter 入门与实战专栏源码。如有问题可以加本人微信交流，微信号：island-coder。\n👍🏻：觉得有收获请点个赞鼓励一下！\n🌟：收藏文章，方便回看哦！\n💬：评论交流，互相进步！",

          "description": "前言\n众所周知，Flutter 的 WebView 不太友好，用起来不顺手。\n我们 Flutter 开发常用的 WebView 库有2个，一个是 Flutter 官方自己出的 webview_flutter ，另一个是比较流行的 flutter_inappwebview 。这两个库其实差不多，flutter_inappwebview 功能比较丰富，封装了很多事件、方法等，但是很多问题这两个库都会遇到。本文以 webview_flutter 为基础库展开讲解相关问题以及解决方案。\n问题\n白屏、UI错乱\n如上图所示\n测试的时候发现部分手机（如OPPO）会出现白屏现象\n原生与 Flutter 混编，打开页面会发现页面布局变了，顶部banner变小了\n查阅网上的一些解决方案，千篇一律都是：\nif (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform = SurfaceAndroidWebView();\n\n但是，这样设置其实是不对的，还会出现以上问题，真正的解决方案是：\nif (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform = AndroidWebView();\n\n视频自动播放\n由于需求需要，打开页面的时候，列表的第一个视频（YouTube/Facebook 视频）需要自动播放。\n但是发现没法自动播放，如下图，会出现播放之后马上暂停的现象。\n查阅资料得知，是谷歌浏览器的隐私政策导致的。\nChrome 的自动播放策略\n\n始终允许静音自动播放。\n在以下情况下允许自动播放声音：\n\n用户与域进行了交互（单击、点击等）\n在桌面上，用户的媒体参与指数阈值已被超过，这意味着用户之前播放过有声视频。\n用户已将网站添加到移动设备的主屏幕或在桌面设备上安装 PWA。\n顶级框架可以将自动播放权限委托给其 iframe 以允许自动播放声音。\n所以要想视频自动播放，有两种方案：\n静音播放。\n\n在 Web 端调用视频播放器的静音即可自动播放。\n模拟点击。\n\n给 WebView 设置一个 GlobalKey 。\nWebView(\n    key: logic.state.videoGlobalKey,\n    ......\n  );\n}\n\n然后在 WebView 的 onPageFinished 方法里，通过 GlobalKey 获取 WebView 的位置，从而进行模拟点击，就可以自动播放视频了。\nvar currentContext = state.videoGlobalKey.currentContext;\nvar offset = (currentContext?.findRenderObject() as RenderBox)\n    .localToGlobal(Offset.zero);\n//模拟点击\nvar addPointer = PointerAddedEvent(\n  pointer: 0,\n  position: Offset(\n      offset.dx + 92.w,\n      offset.dy + 92.w),\n);\nvar downPointer = PointerDownEvent(\n  pointer: 0,\n  position: Offset(\n      offset.dx + 92.w,\n      offset.dy + 92.w),\n);\nvar upPointer = PointerUpEvent(\n  pointer: 0,\n  position: Offset(\n      offset.dx + 92.w,\n      offset.dy + 92.w),\n);\nGestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(addPointer);\nGestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(downPointer);\nGestureBinding.instance!.handlePointerEvent(upPointer);\n\n这两种方案各有利弊，方案一无法播放声音（需要用户手动点击开启声音），方案二偶尔会有误触的操作。我们 APP 通过与产品商量最终选取的是方案一的解决方案。\n另外 iOS 端自动播放会自动全屏，需要设置以下属性：\nWebView(\n    key: logic.state.videoGlobalKey,\n    // 允许在线播放（解决iOS播放视频自动全屏）\n    allowsInlineMediaPlayback: true,\n    ......\n  );\n}\n\n以下是需求完成的完整效果：",

Are you really trying to tell me that we couldn’t already do this?\nSure enough, when I went to Google Drive on the web and pressed Command + C on a file, then went into a folder and pressed Command + V, nothing happened. And this December 2021 archive of Drive’s list of keyboard shortcuts doesn’t say anything about the functions.

Deadline reports that Foster has signed on to True Detective’s fourth season to portray Liz Danvers, a detective tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearances of six people from a research station in Ennis, Alaska. While Danvers is up for the task of figuring out where went wrong near the Tsalal Arctic Research Station, she and her partner arrive in Ennis just as the region’s long winter night and its all-encompassing darkness begin to set in.\nIn addition to starring as Danvers, Foster will also executive produce this chapter of True Detective alongside Barry Jenkins, and the...\nContinue reading…",

Sony is also working on a movie based on the Gran Turismo series, according to Deadline, but hasn’t found a distributor for it yet, and could feature Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie) as its director.
