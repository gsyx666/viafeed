          "description": "When working on accessibility, a common issue you might come across is that your HTML tag doesn't have a lang attribute.\nThe lang attribute tells the user which language the page is written in.\nSome examples of valid lang attributes are:\n<!-- French content -->\n<html lang=\"fr\"></html>\n\nNote: Find all languages codes here.\nWe can also extend the use-case to define specific versions of a language, for instance, British English.\n<html lang=\"en-gb\"></html>\n\nIn any regular plain HTML website, we would add this tag to the HTML element. However, in the case of Next.js, we don't have direct access to it.\nSo to add this tag, we need to use the next.config.js file.\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n};\n\nIf your website supports multiple languages, you can even put various values in the locales array.\nThe default locales are then used to set the current one.\nYou can even use this config to set up custom domains, but we might dive into that separately.\nThere is an alternative way of adding a custom HTML tag if you want to override multiple HTML properties.\nInside your pages directory, you can add a _document.js file.\nThis page will override the default Next.js document.\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang='en'>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  );\n}\n\nAnd that's it, two different ways of adding the lang tag in Next.js.\nThank you for reading my blog.

Fast forward to today and you can do much more with JavaScript. When companies started adopting JavaScript, a standard document called ECMAScript standard was written by ECMA International organization to maintain a standard in the language. Theoretically JavaScript can also be called as ECMAScript.\nToday, JavaScript is not limited to the browser, you can write JavaScript on any device that has a JavaScript engine (A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code) Some of the popular JavaScript engines are\nV8 - used in chrome, Microsoft edge, Opera, Node.js etc.\nJavaScript for the browser\nPHP for web server\nSwift for IOS applications\netc.\nWith introduction of Node.js, JavaScript become a backend language as well. Node.js was built on top the v8 engine which already supported JavaScript. What makes Node.js standout is it's non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient, Node.js can asynchronously continue executing code while listening for other events.\nIf you are someone new to the world of programming, you could build full stack web applications with the knowledge of one language. Also front-end developers who primarily use JavaScript can work on the backend without learning a new language.\nFinally I want to leave this famous quote by Jeff Attwood also known as the Atwood's Law.\nAtwood's Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript",

Other developers use various cloud platforms so that they don’t need to worry about security logic, and these platforms help developers with most secure ways of authenticating users.\nWe are going to see how you can use Firebase auth service to secure your react APP.\nFirst you will need to set up our own Firebase project through the Firebase Console. To get started, navigate your browser to Firebase Console. Make sure you are logged into your Google account.\nNow, click on Add project and follow the simple instructions provided. Once presented with a dashboard, click on Authentication on the sidebar and click on Get Started to enable the module. Now you will be presented with various authentication options. Click on Email/Password, enable it, and save it. We will come back later, let create our react app first.\nNavigate to your terminal and use npx create-react-app appname to create a new react app.\nnpm install firebase react-router-dom react-firebase-hooks \nNow lets go back to the Firebase Console dashboard, click on Project Settings. Click on the third icon (</>) to configure our Firebase project for the web. Here you will see a config file. Copy the config. Create a new file in the src folder named firebase.js, import firebase modules, and paste the config file here.\nWith this on your react app you can now start to create login and signup forms and use the firebase authentication module.",

More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.\nWhen it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge.

          "description": "what should I know before learning Java\n\n\nWell, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)\n\nI am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. \nIf you are a beginner, please don't use any kind of IDE.\n IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. \nIt is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. \nAs using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. \nSo you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. \nThis learning method is slow but very effective. \nAlthough you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. \nYou can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.💯",

It also highlights the line with different colors to help you better visualize and differentiate between errors, warnings and other messages!\n\nWith this extension, you can search for relevant CSS files by using CSS classes in html file and edit CSS files there itself! Here's how it works:\n\nGitLens is a powerful extension which can display when a particular line was committed, by whom it was committed and in which pull request it was included along with the commit message! All of this information is inline with the line upon which your cursor is currently located.\nYou can also hover over the message to get even more information about a particular line of code!\n\n\nThere are many more features in GitLens which you can explore and play around with!\nImport Cost allows us to see the size of the imported package inline in the editor itself!\n\nVersion Lens fetches information about dependency versions and displays it on top of the package!\n\nThese were the 5 VSCode extensions which are powerful, useful and can improve your productivity and workflow!\nSigning off.\nTwitter | GitHub | LinkedIn",

          "description": "在 Ubuntu 中重新设置已忘记的 root 用户的密码\n\r\n\r\n这篇简单的指南将向你解释，如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 好 20.04 LTS 桌面环境中，以及从服务器版本中的 恢复rescue 模式中重新设置 sudo 密码。\n\r\n介绍\n\r\n在 安装 Ubuntu 时，创建的一个新用户将会带有 sudo 权限，用以执行各种各样的管理任务。\n\r\n如果你的 Ubuntu 系统有多个 sudo 用户，你能够从另外一个 sudo 用户的账号下，轻松地重新设置所忘记的一个 sudo 用户或管理员用户的密码。\n\r\n如果你只有一个 sudo 用户，并且忘记了密码怎么办？没有问题! 从 Ubuntu 的 恢复rescue 或 单一用户single user 模式中恢复 sudo 用户密码很容易。\n\r\n虽然这篇指南是在 Ubuntu 22.04 和 20.04 LTS 版本上进行的正式测试，不过，下面给定的步骤对于其它的 Ubuntu 版本和衍生版本来说是相同的。\n\r\n在 Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04 LTS 中重新设置 sudo 密码\n\r\n首先，启动你的 Ubuntu 系统到 恢复rescue 模式下，来重新设置一个 sudo 用户的密码，操作如下面的链接所述。\n\r\n\r\n如何启动到 Ubuntu 22.04 /  20.04 / 18.04 的 恢复rescue 模式 或 急救Emergency模式\n\r\n\r\n现在，进入到 恢复rescue 模式下，通过运行下面的命令，以读/写的模式挂载根（/）文件系统：\n\r\n# mount -n -o remount,rw /\r\n\n\r\n现在，使用 passwd 命令来重新设置 sudo 用户的密码:\n\r\n# passwd ostechnix\r\n\n\r\n在这里，ostechnix 是 sudo 用户的名称。使用你自己的用户名称来替换掉它。\n\r\n输入两次密码：\n\r\nNew password:\r\nRetype new password:\r\npasswd: password updated successfully\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n就这样。我们已经重新设置 sudo 用户密码。如果你按照上面链接所述的方法 1 进入到 恢复rescue 模式，按下 Ctrl+d 组合键来启动到正常模式。或者，你也可以输入下面的任意一个命令来启动到正常模式。\n\r\n# systemctl default\r\n\n\r\n或，\n\r\n# exit\r\n\n\r\n如果你想重新启动系统，而不是启动到正常模式，输入：\n\r\n# systemctl reboot\r\n\n\r\n如果你已经按照上面链接所述的方法 2 进入到恢复rescue 模式，输入：\n\r\n# exit\r\n\n\r\n你将返回到 恢复菜单recovery menu。现在选择 “恢复正常启动Resume normal boot”，并按下回车键。\n\r\n\n\r\n在强调一次，选择 “确定OK” 按钮，并按下回车按键来继续启动到正常模式：\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，你在运行管理命令时可以使用新的 sudo 密码。\n\r\n如果我把用户名称和密码都忘了怎么办？\n\r\n如果你忘记了用户名称，在 恢复rescue 模式下，你可以很容易地列出你的 Linux 系统中的用户名称，使用目录：\n\r\n# cat etc/passwd\r\n\n\r\n来自我 Ubuntu 22.04 系统的输出示例：\n\r\n[...]\r\nostechnix:x:1000:1000:Ostechnix,,,:/home/ostechnix:/bin/bash\r\n[...]\r\n\n\r\n好了，现在，你找到用户名称了。只需要按照上面的步骤来重新设置用户的密码即可。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://ostechnix.com/how-to-reset-sudo-password-in-ubuntu-20-04-lts/\n\r\n作者：sk 选题：lkxed 译者：robsean 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "一切都要从“书号”开始说起。\n关于书号，在此引用百度百科的定义：\n\n书号即ISBN，最直观的就是书的封底的条型码和那一串数字。是由中华人民共和国新闻出版总署分配给各个出版社的。国内的书号还在书的第二页（一般在扉页的反面）配有CIP数据，该页也称为版权页。这二者是在国内出版图书不可缺少的两个必要数据。\n《乔布斯传》版权页\n根据相关规定，书号由新闻出版总署分配给各个出版社，每年有一定配额，个人和民营企业无法申请书号。\n简单来说，出版社是国企，每年从新闻出版总署那领到一定数量的书号资源，只有他们才有资格出版图书。知名的出版社有人民文学出版社、中信出版社、上海译文出版社等，他们经济效益好，出版图书多，书号紧俏。但另一些出版社，由于能力有限，图书出版数量不多，有书号闲余。\n图书出版市场除了出版社，还有出版公司，他们有优秀的书籍策划能力和众多的图书版权资源，但由于是民营企业，没有书号申请资质，于是，出版公司便与有书号闲余的出版社合作，由出版公司编辑策划发行，出版社提供书号，负责审核，出版。一家出版社的书号可能有多家出版公司在使用，一家出版公司也会同时使用多家出版社书号。优秀的出版公司也有很多，例如新经典、果麦、磨铁、读客等。\n除了出版社和出版公司，还有一个概念是图书品牌。有的出版公司或出版社自身的名字即为图书品牌，比如新经典文化的“新经典”、磨铁文化的“磨铁”、读库文化的“读库”，人民文学出版社、三联书店等；有的图书品牌则是出版公司或出版社的子品牌，比如译林出版社旗下的“方尖碑”品牌、社会科学文献出版社旗下的“甲骨文”品牌、广西师范大学出版社直属机构北京贝贝特出版顾问旗下的“理想国”品牌。\n以上就是关于出版社、出版公司和出版品牌三者之间的联系。不同出版社和出版公司因为自身发展原因，会侧重不同的方向，形成自己的优势领域，比如中信出版社的经济管理类书籍、新星的推理小说、上海译文出版社的外国…",

          "description": "（题图与本文内容无关，切勿对号入座）\n从本月初开始，我和几位朋友一起做了一个小小的写作共学实验。我把它叫做「G·写作共学」。这个共学的长期目的当然是在以 GRE Issue 为代表的高水平写作测试中达到高分的要求。至于短期目标嘛，……应该是「用汉语写一篇合格的英语作文」吧。\n为什么要用汉语写英语作文题？或者说，作为经历过高考、接受过似乎还不错的语文教育的成年人，我们为什么要回到如此基础的写作训练上呢？\n用汉语写英语作文有什么用？\n要回答这个问题，我们可以先追溯一下这类英语写作测试的评分标准。GRE Issue 的评分标准包括下列五项：\n\n清晰且有效地陈述观点\n以恰当的说理和事例支持观点\n文章结构清晰完整、重点突出\n内容流畅、表述精确、句式多样且措辞考究\n使用合乎标准的英语书面语进行写作\n\n另一个性质类似的写作测试是 TOEFL 的独立写作部分。该部分的评分标准由这样四个维度组成：\n\n针对话题和题目要求做出清晰的表述\n结构完整，解释、例证和细节清晰到位\n内容连贯、有序且通顺\n使用合乎标准的书面英语进行写作。\n\n与 TOEFL 独立写作性质和作用相当的雅思大作文（Task 2）的评分维度则是「写作任务回应情况」「连贯与衔接」「词汇丰富程度」「语法多样性及准确性」。\n由此可见，无论是语言能力考试（TOEFL 和雅思），还是逻辑能力测试（GRE），在话题写作这部分考查的能力，至少有一半和「英语」无关，而关联于普适性的「思维」。\n把上述评分标准中所有的「英语」换成「汉语」，就会很容易得到得到「一篇好的汉语文章」的评价标准。如果你能写出或者「想」出这样一篇好的汉语文章，并在此基础上把它按照英语的写作习惯转换（注意，不是「直译」）成英语文章，就是一篇可以拿到高分的英语文章。\n我们在练习这些考试的写作部分时，其实训练了自己的两项能力：\n其一是思维能力，也即，用自己的母语（或者说，作为思考载…",

          "description": "前两篇文章中，我主要介绍了护肤的基本理论架构——护肤金字塔理论，以及金字塔底层关于清洁和保湿的部分，这一讲中，我们来认真讨论金字塔第一层中另一个非常重要的部分：防晒。防晒是你开始抗老的第一步，如果你没有条件进行充分的抗氧化与刺激再生，那么请一定要做好防晒，把风险隔离在皮肤之外。在开讲之前，如果你对前面的内容还不熟悉，也欢迎随时补课：\n第一节链接：护肤是门学问：从逻辑和方法开始说起\n第二节链接：护肤是门学问：我该如何进行清洁和保湿\n养儿不防老，防晒才防老\n这句话你大概已经在各位护肤博主哪里听腻了，但是我还是要在强调一次：防老的第一步就是要防晒。光老化问题是导致皮肤老化的重要元凶，紫外线才是你身边最危险的杀手，所以严格防晒是你开始防老的第一步。\n紫外线的危害\n紫外线中，可以对皮肤造成损伤的部分主要是长波紫外线（UVA）和短波紫外线（UVB）两种光波，它们的波段和波长都不同，对皮肤的损伤表现也有区别。\nUVB是“表面杀手”，波长只能到达皮肤表层，最大的危害就是晒红、晒伤。大多数对紫外线过敏的人，都是对UVB的损伤非常敏感。UVA则负责“深层破坏”，往往能能够穿透到真皮层，带来晒黑、皱纹和色斑等问题。无论哪一种伤害，对皮肤健康来说都是不容小视的。所以防嗮是一个既要治标，又要治本的过程。\nUVA与UVB的损害（图片源自网络）\n防晒的选择\n防晒能力评价标准\n既然需要治标和治本双管齐下，那么在选择防晒产品的时候就需要两方面并重。防晒产品一般也会标榜自己两方面的防护力：PA与SPF。PA是指对UVA的防护力度，以“+”的数量多少来衡量防护能力的强弱；SPF是指对UVB的防护力度，以数值的大小来衡量防护能力的大小。综合两者来看，市面上的防晒产品的防护力可以分成三个不同等级：\n低防护力：SPF<30 PA++ 及以下\n中防护力：SPF=30~50  PA+++\n高防护力：SPF=50 PA++…",

Instead of opting for a spherical shape that comes with the Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod Mini, or even the rounded rectangular look of the Google Nest Audio device, a sketch shows what appears to be a speaker with a sloped top and a wide base.\nOnline records show that Comcast first filed for the patent last year, but it didn’t get approved until April 2022. As seen in the sketch, the device seems to have playback controls on the side of the speaker, with an additional button and a small stand on the bottom. \nImage: Comcast via USPTO\n      The smart speaker...\n  \nContinue reading…",

The page for the Retro 35’s crowdfunding campaign is very careful not to mention the name of Apple’s classic computer, but it’s drawn some very obvious inspiration, from the beige color scheme down to the placement of the disk drive. The device is eventually set to retail for $49, with Indiegogo “early bird” pricing starting at $25. \nAs increasing numbers of phone manufacturers have stopped shipping charging bricks with their devices, aftermarket chargers are becoming more popular.

The fashion brand previously collaborated with the virtual world for more short-lived experiences, like the surreal Gucci Garden from last year, and is now releasing a more persistent space called Gucci Town.

Some, including my colleague Sean Hollister, have tried a DIY solution to fix the whine, and iFixit’s replacement Steam Deck fans are already sold out despite being on sale for less than a week. \nWith SteamOS 3.2, though, Valve introduced a new OS-controlled fan curve that’s intended to make things better. “This means that overall it’s smarter, more responsive to what’s happening on and inside Steam Deck, and quieter — especially in low usage situations,” the company said in a...\nContinue reading…",
