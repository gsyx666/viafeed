Also how do youshare such a project with others?\nUse boolean logic in Python Boolean logic is used to ensure your program can have more than one execution flow. \nWorking with strings in Python String is central to any program language. \nUse mathematical operators in Python You will want to use mathematical operators to work on your data.\nIntroduction to lists in Python When you have many instances of your data, like a list of products, lists are a great structure to use.\nUse for and while loops in Python You will want to repeat some statements, loops is how you do just that.\nManage data with Python dictionaries Sometimes, you need to look up values. Dictionaries enables you to organize data in such a way where you have keys points to a values where the keys all have to do with each other, like portrait cards of a deck of cards.\nPython functions To avoid repetition, among other things, it's good to organize reoccurring statements in logical grouping you can refer to.

          "description": "With millions of tutorials, Twitter threads, and clones of projects, there's a clear distinction between tracing and transformation.\nTracing has its time and place. If you are examining how an application was built, understanding syntax, and so on. Wordle, Flappy Bird, and Todo List clones have value for beginners.\nRevenue in this space is sparse and scrappy, but some clones have gotten traction and made tons of money. \nIs it right to monetize it? In my opinion: Not really, but I'm not a cop.\nTransformation is a substantial difference, like AskJeeves vs. Google or Facebook vs. MySpace. Transformation falls into two phases: Minor or Major.\nMinor transformation is more than slight tweaks or coloring outside the lines. Adding six letters to the Wordle game instead of 5 is more like tracing. Making it a PWA is more a transformation, in my opinion. Learning is more abundant than purely Tracing. Tutorials should encourage this, expanding the idea past the end. It's small and meaningful changes. \nMajor Transformation is much more complex—AskJeeves vs. Google or Facebook vs. MySpace. The idea is the same but a constant refinement of critical points. It's easy to see some inspiration, but the list of differences is vast and expanding. \nThere will always be those tracing others' projects and making cash or getting clout. It's part of the process now. Tracing isn't going to make a lasting product or great developers. It's mostly laziness or lack of creativity. \nLasting products or ideas either fit into Major Transformation or Creation. Creation is much more challenging.\nSuppose you're interested in reading more about Creation. I highly recommend the book Zero to One. \nI'll leave you with two questions:\nIs this Tracing or a Transformation? \nDoes it matter if it's Open-Source?\nUses Tech the Original vs Tech Blogs, Launched on Product Hunt\n\n\n\n\nSorry for The Office memes, but it's a really good show.",

ANTLR is doing its best to be that good enough parser generator.\nIn terms of its ability to parse things, it's likely the best one out there. ANTLR is built upon different principles (LL) than other parser generators (historically LR, nowadays also occasionally PEG), but we won't be getting into any theory here today.

You’ve lost me. Your design looks like one of 6,000 other sites out there. And not just the same general layout, but the Exact. Same. Components.\n”Let’s be honest: a great many of us are tired of seeing the same old Twitter Bootstrap theme again and again. Black header, giant hero, rounded blue buttons, Helvetica Neue. Yes, you can customize the header to be a different color, maybe re-color some of the buttons, use a different font. Ultimately, however, that doesn’t change anything—it still looks like Bootstrap.\nh u g e!\n\n\nBootstrap will help you to build an attractive, responsive website, but some mobile users could be turned away by the slow loading time and battery drain issues. Bootstrap comes with a lot of lines of CSS and JS, which is a good thing, but also a bad thing because of the bad internet connection. And there’s also the problem with the server that will take all the heat for using such a heavy framework. Even when bootstrap is minified, it takes a lot of space\nThere is no faster framework than Tailwind when it comes to styling HTML. As a result, you can easily create good-looking layouts by styling elements directly. This is possible because Tailwind offers thousands of built-in classes that do not require you to create designs from scratch",

With that in mind, I have taken my first step towards getting back on track, and now I am a software engineering student at Flatiron School!\nI am happy to be among the passioned and focused people, who are not afraid to change their lives and do what they love. I don't want to lie, it is tough, and I still have 12 weeks of intensive program ahead of me. I am excited and overwhelmed at the same time, sometimes frustrated and definitely tired (thanks again to my husband, he looks after the kids after daycare and cooks while I am on campus or continue studying after the kids go to bed). However, it is rewarded with happiness of getting something to work, with confidence when you passed the test with understanding and when you completed your first project.

NFT can be any digital assets, artworks, pictures, videos or music. What makes them interesting is that they have unique properties which make it easy to prove ownership.\nFor example, if you have a picture, let's assume your picture, to make it an NFT, you just have to store it with its attribute on the blockchain. You don't even need to be a programmer or technical person to do this. This can be easily done on  Opensea .\nNFTs are quite popular because people are buying and selling it. you may not be able to sell your NFT picture but if you are an artist or a creative, you can make a lot of money listing your creative asset on an NFT marketplace. \nWhat makes NFT stand out in the blockchain world?\nThey can be traded across different ecosystems, this means you can view your NFT on different wallets and marketplaces. This is possible due to open standards adopted across the ecosystem.\nNFTs are been utilized in various industries.\nOpensea  or other platforms\nOpulous  as NFTs\nAirNFTs  as NFTs\n Axie infinity  game.\nDecentraland \nNFT Marketplaces\nThe most popular one is  Opensea\nOthers are SuperRare and\nRarible \nThank you for taking the time to read, you probably have no idea how blockchain works\nYou can check out my article -  Blockchain for Beginners",

          "description": "Discovering the need for stream metadata.\nOne of the best uses of Event Sourcing is to manage behaviors between entities, aka relationships. This is where all interesting things happen. For example, a product catalog is just a collection of data. It doesn't do anyone any good until those products are sold, shipped, restocked, etc. All of these processes occur between people or companies. They occur in relationships.\nThese relationships need to be reflected somewhere in the event stream. In our domain of safety training, the main activity we track is training. Which involves a student and a course. We use a Training ID (a UUID) to identify each training process. If we were creating relational tables, we would include foreign keys to Student ID and Course ID to track the entities involved. H…",

          "description": "Now that we have a good understanding of how JavaScript setTimeout works to delay a function.\nLet's look at how we can perform an action every x time.\nThis can be super helpful for animating stuff or checking a data feed.\nLet's look at how this will work in its most basic form.\nsetInterval(() => {\n  // Run every 100 milliseconds\n}, 100);\n\nThis function will run every 100 milliseconds.\nOften you might want to achieve this to run only until a specific condition is met.\nWe can clear the interval by using the clearInterval.\nconst timer = setInterval(() => {\n  // Do something\n}, 100);\n\nclearInterval(timer);\n\nOr you can even stop it from inside the interval.\nconst timer = setInterval(() => {\n  if (condition) {\n    clearInterval(timer);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Execute the function\n}, 100);\n\nThis is a great way to stop a particular action from running.\nWhen you use setInterval, it does not care how long your function runs.\nMeaning it will always start a new loop at the set time.\nFor example, when you use it to animate, but the animations have different lengths, it might cause weird side-effects where the following animation will start, and the first one isn't even done.\n\nAs you can see, each function can have its own time to execute, meaning they can overlap and cause issues.\nIf you find yourself needing them to wait, using setTimeout might be a better solution.\nWe can set up a recursive setTimeout function.\nconst coolFunc = () => {\n  // Execute the function\n\n  setTimeout(coolFunc, 100);\n};\n\nsetTimeout(coolFunc, 100);\n\nWhich will result in the following flow.\n\nIf you are keen to see some more real-world examples, here is a list of articles using them.\nFading images with JavaScript\nCreating a song in JavaScript\nCountdown clock\nThank you for reading my blog.

Between the years of technical debt as a result of numerous developers and agencies working on it, and the upcoming EOL for Magento 1 support, it was quickly becoming obvious that an upgrade was due for the shop.\nOne of the most challenging parts of any project - what technology stack do we want to use!?\nWe decided to stick with Magento, moving to v2, for a number of reasons.

Let me tell you mine.\nSo the first reason is that I have spent so much money on different plugins, for different problems to solve. \nThe second reason is that I don't want to use a plugin for everything. So while you learn how to build a plugin, you will see that there are so much more and simpler options than just installing and using a plugin. For example, I am sure that instead of using 3 plugins for different purposes, you can surely add the scripts that those plugins are using into a code snippet, or add it to the functions.php. But that was just an example. The solution can be different in many ways. \nThe third reason is…",

Learning where you are ignorant is an essential step in understanding.\nWhen you don't know anything about software development, and you want to learn, it seems like it will either be easy or impossibly hard. It's just a giant skill to acquire. \nBut as you learn, you start to recognize all the different gradations of learning. So this one big thing is actually a bunch of skills, and there are levels of each of them.\nAnd the more you learn about, say, backend development, the more you realize there are other areas you don't understand, like not just frontend, but networking programming, phone development, OS development, and writing firmware. Every little area is fractal with so much knowledge in it.\nPart of learning is just learning how much you don't know, so it makes sense that \"dumb people don't know how dumb they are\" because knowing how dumb you are is something you have to learn. \nWhat do you think?",

          "description": "Let's sketch the use case. We have some roles that can access a particular page.\nThese valid roles are defined in an array.\nconst roles = ['moderator', 'administrator', 'superman'];\n\nHow can we check to see if a user's role is part of this list?\nFor the sake of this article, we'll assume the user's role is a simple string like so:\ncost role = 'user';\n\nThere are a couple of options for us here. Let's take a look at each of them.\nThis might be my personal most used option. It's quick and straightforward and has no weird overhead.\nThis includes method will return true or false if it can find the string you are looking for.\nroles.includes('user');\n// false\n\nroles.includes('moderator');\n// true\n\nWe can also use indexOf, which will return -1 if it can't find the item or the actual index if it does.\nroles.indexOf('user');\n// -1\n\nroles.indexOf('superman');\n// 2\n\nThis could be super helpful if you need the item's index anyway, but I think includes should work better for you if you don't.\nAnother way of doing this is using the some method, this will return a boolean like the includes method.\nIt will return if some of the items in the array match the search query.\nroles.some((role) => role === 'user');\n// false\n\nroles.some((role) => role === 'moderator');\n// true\n\nAgain, depending on the use-case, this could be the better solution, mainly good if you would have to check for multiple things to match.\nThe find method is a new way of searching an array, and it will return undefined or the item.\nroles.find((role) => role === 'user');\n// undefined\n\nroles.find((role) => role === 'moderator');\n// 'moderator'\n\nThis method is perfect if you need the entire object to do something with.\nAnd there you go, multiple ways of checking if an array contains a value.\nYou can try all of these out in the following CodePen (Note: Open your terminal)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Thank you for reading, and let's connect!\n\n\nThank you for reading my blog.

As a frontend developer, it is only right to be curious about trending tools and frameworks from time to time hence i tried my hands on Next.js and i was totally blown away.\nNextjs is an open source React framework created by Vercel.

The evolution of the web is often partitioned into three separate stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.\n\nWeb 1.0 was the first iteration of the web. Most participants were consumers of content, and the creators were typically developers who build websites that contained information served up mainly in text or image format. \nThe next iteration of the internet was called the “web 2.0” or the “read-write” web.

These platforms often have the pre-built templates, drag-and-drop functionality to design UI, and integrations with  databases, so they can ultimately be deployed as your own mobile or web app.\nThere are many no-code app builders on the market, and it can be hard to find the best option, especially because you can often only see a landing page, marketing information, and exciting slogans. \nSerhii Pospielov, AI Practice Head at Exadel, reviewed several no-code app builders from a developer's point of view. He tried to create MVPs on 13 different platforms, but only managed to achieve that on five (this doesn’t mean that the other eight aren’t good platforms – just that they didn’t meet his particular business need).  Serhii’s favorite no-code app builders were: \nAppery.io, \nAppGyver, \nCheck out his Best No-Code App Builders (Part 1) on Medium and see the other top platforms in his list along with their screenshots of interfaces. \nYou’ll also find concrete information about the difference between no-code and low-code mobile app builders, the role of back end on a mobile application, the key stages in developing a mobile app, and more things to consider when evaluating the costs of no-code app builders.",

'exp 1' : 'exp 2'); // exp 1\n\nSince we defined a variable called condition as true, the ternary operator executes the first expression which is a simple string \"exp 1\". \nThe console.log() around the ternary operator logs the result of the ternary operator and it logs \"exp 1\".\nAs I said above, you can read this operator as follow: IF the condition is true execute expression1 else execute expression2. But this is not entirely accurate!\nSo, what is the problem?\nWhen talking about Javascript Ternary Operator, MDN talks about truthy and falsy instead of true and false.\ncondition ? expression1 : expression2\n\nIF the condition is truthy execute expression1 else (falsy) execute expression2.\nIn simple terms, \nTruthy values are equal or can be converted to true. Which values are truthy? All values unless they are defined as falsy. Thanks…\nFalsy values are equal or can be converted to false.

Say you have a simple game and need to track the position of mouse clicks. You’d store every position in a set object. Duplicate values are discarded when an attempt to add the set object is made.\nSample code showing a simple Set object usage:\nfunction main() {\n\n    const gameScreen = document.getElementById('game-screen')\n    gameScreen.addEventListener('click' updateAction)\n\n    const cursorPositions = new Set()\n    function updateAction(event) {\n      let position = {x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY}\n      cursorPositions.add(position) // any duplicate values are discarded, which is ideal in this case\n    }\n    // use unique cursorPositions below\n}\n\nwhile(true) {\n  main()\n}\n\nDuplicate values are discarded when added to a set. This is useful for capturing and storing unique values where duplicate values are not needed.\nconst letters = new Set()\nletters.add('A')\nletters.add('B')\nletters.add('A') // duplicate entry is ignored\nconsole.log(letters) // Set {2} {'A', 'B'} \n\nThe set object provides a way of storing data where duplicate values are not required.\nNote: Most languages including JavaScript offer a lot of language features but it’s not a good approach to try learning all these language features at a go.

It was an SPA developed with AngularJs and ASP.NET Web API REST endpoints to interface with production services on a shop-floor application. I cannot say it was the best job on the whole dev team, but considering the level of success, it did pretty good.\nAnyway, new challenges were arising and it was obvious that a choice had to be made: Angular or React. Why? because that's the way JS web frameworks evolve right? Having more than 10 years using .NET ecosystem of tools and apps, it seems like it is more of a corporate environment that moves slowly, compared to the new JS frameworks surging every few months.\nWell then, after all this time the result was that now Angular is my weapon of choice for web development. And there where a few attempts with React (nothing really for \"production\"). \nHopefully, these days the Angular community seems to me stronger than ever (that seemed as a weak point before, compare to other options).\nI don't think it's necessary to debate wether or not it was a good decision, whatever happens is experience and something to learn.

It has a small footprint, and is easy to learn. Svelte is also very fast, and can be used to create powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it is already attracting a lot of attention. The framework has been designed from the ground up to be efficient and lightweight, and it offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks such as Angular and React. \nOne of the biggest advantages of Svelte is its small footprint. The framework is only about 2.5 KB in size, making it one of the smallest frameworks available. This makes it ideal for use in mobile applications and other small devices. \nSvelte is also very fast. It has been designed to take advantage of modern hardware, and it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This makes Svelte a good choice for creating powerful web applications. \nSvelte is still in development, but it looks like it is going to be a popular framework. It offers a lot of advantages over other frameworks, and it is small and efficient.

Check out what's new 👇\nYou may have already noticed that we obsess over user experience in places where humans meet APIs. And we like to simplify things, a lot.\n\nPointer cursors were invented to indicate links on the Web. It is tempting to adopt them for all active elements in apps that use web technologies, like we initially did. However, after a thorough research, we decided to say goodbye to pointer cursors.\nSpeaking of design: we—and our beta users—didn’t like the default title bar in the desktop app. It wasted space and didn’t fit our custom design – the entire window should blend in with the app’s personality.

Matt is one of the most prominent thought leaders on neurodiversity in the workplace.\nMatt himself was diagnosed with autism late in life following a very unique job interview at Google. He’s since spent countless hours researching, writing and talking about how companies can not only bring neurodiverse talent into the fold, but why engineering teams thrive when they do.\nIn this episode of Dev Interrupted we talk with Matt about best practices in recruiting, hiring and working with neurodiverse coders, how his interview at Google interview led to an autism diagnosis, the ways Matt’s data team at the University of Washington is helping combat COVID and what private companies can learn from the ROI metrics of universities and public institutions.\nDan and Matt also took some time to geek out about GitLab.\nWe hope this conversation was as enlightening for you as it was for us and we hope it helps you find your next great hire.\n\n\n \nHow Matt’s autism diagnosis changed his career\nHiring neurodiverse talent\nInclusive interview best practices for neurodiverse candidates\nROI metrics: public sector vs private sector\nUW’s data team and its efforts to combat COVID\nYou're Invited to INTERACT on April 7th - It's online & it's free!\n\n\nBack by popular demand, Dev Interrupted has announced it will be hosting the next iteration of its engineering leadership conference, INTERACT 2.0.

A blockchain is a publicly available and distributed database, which acts as the memory of the EVM. One role of this memory is acting as a ledger, saying who owns how much Ether, the cryptocurrency supported by the Ethereum network. The computers participating in this network are called “nodes” or “miners”, and the computational power they contribute is what keeps the EVM running. For their work, they are rewarded with Ether, hence the term “miners”. The EVM can also run programs called “smart contracts”, which are programs stored on the blockchain and run on the EVM.\nBlockchain\n\n\nA blockchain is a publicly available and distributed…",

          "description": "今天除夕，然而今年除夕不是“大年三十”，是“大年廿九”。\n理解这个事情，有几个层次。\n第一层：还有多少“大年廿九”？\n我考察了前后各一个世纪（1920s-2110s）的数据，发现两百年间，有118个“大年三十”、83个“大年廿九”。列表如下：\n“大”表示30天的大月，“小”表示29天的小月\n第二层：为什么会有三十/廿九（大小月）的差别？\n因为月相变化周期（朔望月）的平均长度是29.530588天，不是整数。农历为了确保每个“朔”（新月）都在初一，必须根据实际月相调整每个月的长度，使之取29天或30天。\n当然，你可能意识到了，“平均长度”意味着每个朔望月的长度是可以有变化的。实际上变化范围可以相当大：从不足29.3天到29.8天多，可以浮动半天还多。\n\n第三层：那么大小月是由朔望周期决定的吗？\n不难理解，不只由朔望周期决定。\n假设这个月的新月开始于某天0时，假设这个月的朔望周期是29.5天，那么下一个新月出现在第30天中午12点——也就是说第30天会被定义为下个月初一，本月就只能享有29天，成为小月。\n但如果这个月的新月开始于某天12时之后，下一个新月出现在第31天午夜0时之后，那么第31天才会被定义为下个月初一，本月可以成为拥有30天的“大月”。\n所以，大小月由两个参数决定：本月月初的新月出现在几点，以及本月的朔望周期。如下图所示。\n图中橙色、蓝色点的分界线，就是次月新月刚好卡在第30天、第31天之间的午夜0时的情况。\n\n第四层：为什么“大年三十”比“大年廿九”多？\n按照朔望周期平均29.53天考虑，大月、小月的数量之比应该是53:47～1.13。\n我统计了1921到2121这两个世纪，其中大月有1319个，小月有1167个，1319:1167=1.130，完全符合预期。\n但是，同期的大年三十和大年廿九的比例，却是118:83=1.42，比预期的1.13显著更大，这是为什么呢？\n我画出朔望周期在每年各个月份的分布：\n\n可以看出，年底年初的朔望周期，平均来说比年中的朔望周期要长4个小时——这是因为，地球在1月份到达近日点，绕日公转最快，此时月球需要追更长时间才能到达同样的相位，因此朔望周期较长。\n因此农历十二月，也就有更大的机会分到大月。\n\n总结：\n朔望月的平均长度是29.530588天，但是可以在约29.3到29.8之间浮动。\n农历大小月取决于当月和下月的新月出现在哪天。或者说，取决于当月月初的新月时刻和该月朔望周期。\n虽然大小月的总体比例接近53:47，但是腊月的大小月比例显著较高，可达1.42，因此大年多“三十”，较少“廿九”。\n你明白了吗？\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n刘博洋\n点击下载",

          "description": "如果你看到了这篇文章，那么恭喜你，你将成为全中国最先了解“维C黄脸”真相的一批人。\n关于用了维C为什么脸黄，目前中文互联网上的解释都很牵强。于是我去查了一下文献，发现事实远比想象的复杂。除了脸变黄外，手掌，指甲缝还有手指缝都有可能变黄，这种变黄没法用清洁产品洗掉，只能等皮肤慢慢代谢掉。停用之后，基本上一两个星期，皮肤变黄就会消失，而且你会发现肤色比用之前更提亮了一个色号。\n目前中文互联网对于维C变黄的解释很牵强\n关于为什么维C上脸之后，有些人会变黄，目前中文互联网的主流说法是维C的氧化。因为一些维C精华放久了之后，会呈现出比较深的颜色。于是自然而然的认为维C上脸之后被氧化，也是染黄皮肤的元凶。但是这过程中，大家常常忽略一个点，那就是维C精华的颜色并没有深到可以染黄皮肤的地步。\n我手头正好有一瓶接近保质期的维C精华，大家可以看到颜色非常深。\n\n把精华滴一点到手上，颜色对比非常明显，然而涂开之后，对皮肤的颜色根本没有影响。\n\n这是因为维C氧化之后，颜色虽然会变深，但是真正有颜色的成分非常少。这些成分又都是水溶性的，根本没法染黄我们的皮肤。\n用了维C脸黄的元凶竟然是它\n为了搞清楚用了维C脸黄的原因，我查找了大量文献，终于找到了合理的解释。维C染黄角质层的元凶其实是维C代谢的产物之一：赤藓酮糖。\n看到赤藓酮糖这四个字，你的第一反应一定是：这是什么鬼？\n\n实际上，赤藓酮糖在国外可是个大大有名的成分，它是欧美常用的美黑剂。\n和亚洲人不同，欧美人喜欢颜色深的皮肤，这样的人被认为是有钱去海边度假，所以看起来给人感觉比较健康比较美。然而不是所有人都有钱有时间去海边度假，于是国外专门有一类美黑护肤品，而这个赤藓酮糖就是美黑剂的主要成分。它能和角化细胞中的角蛋白结合，形成类黑素，从而让皮肤颜色看起来更深。\n\n由赤藓酮糖来的类黑素并不是黑色的，而是红棕色，当用量较少的时候，看起来就是黄不拉几的颜色。实际上，赤藓酮糖的短期使用效果和维C染黄脸的效果一毛一样！\n\n从维C到赤藓酮糖，鬼知道我经历了什么\n维C的氧化是个非常复杂的过程[1]。简单来说，维C（抗坏血酸）先会变成脱氢抗坏血酸。随后脱氢抗坏血酸进一步变成2,3-二酮古洛糖酸。以此为基础，接下来是非常复杂的化学反应，生成的产物也非常多。而赤藓酮糖就是其中的产物之一。\n\n根据实验，一份维C如果氧化降解完全，可以生成至多0.28份赤藓酮糖，这个转化率相当高了。一般欧美使用赤藓酮糖作为美黑剂，这个成分的添加量是5%。所以如果维C精华含有15%的维C，如果全部氧化完全，相当于4.2%的赤藓酮糖，和欧美主流的美黑剂差不多了。\n好在现在主流的维C精华都使用各种方式来稳定维C，维C降解不多。上脸之后，如果做好防晒，停留在角质层中的维C被氧化的概率也不太大。产生的赤藓酮糖也就非常少了。\n脸黄了怎么办？\n很多人用维C明明是为了提亮肤色，结果脸变黄了，郁闷的同时还不免担心起来，染黄的脸洗都洗不掉！\n其实用了维C之后脸变黄大可不必焦虑，直接停用维C就是了。停止使用之后，也就缺少了赤藓酮糖的输入，皮肤中也就不会形成类黑素，皮肤就不会继续变黄。\n而根据赤藓酮糖的工作原理，它一般只作用于角质层最外层的一些角化细胞。而且我们的皮肤也会正常代谢。随着皮肤的代谢，这些染黄的角化细胞基本上一周就会代谢干净，最长不会超过两周。\n如果你又喜欢维C的功效，又不想皮肤变黄，那么还有个办法就是搭配使用一些果酸类的产品。日常使用维C的时候，手指手掌处的染黄会更明显，因为这些地方的角质层更厚，有更多的角蛋白和赤藓酮糖反应。使用一些温和的果酸类产品剥脱角质层，让角质层薄一些，脸黄就不那么明显了。当然，在使用果酸之前，得确保自己皮肤耐受，而且不是敏感肌。\n\n\n小结一下，用维C脸变黄并不是因为简单的氧化。而是因为维C转化成了赤藓酮糖，而这个成分能和角化细胞结合，形成类黑色素，从而染黄角质层。解决的问题很简单，要么停用维C，脸黄一两周就会消失；要么使用温和的果酸轻微剥脱角质层，减少黄气。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n胖博士\n点击下载\n19 个回答，查看全部。\n直接将vc捣碎用水溶解然后喷在脸上能美白吗？\nVC在护肤品中的形式如何和浓度多少？",

          "description": "先说结论：\n目前自动驾驶德汽车的事故责任判定体系还很不完善，随着自动驾驶技术的普及，类似的争议在短期内还会出现。\n\n\n正如历史所展示的那样，新技术的引入总会引发各种法律、制度上的问题，自动驾驶技术也是如此。\n事实证明，自动驾驶技术也的确引发了全新的法律责任问题，而其中最为重要的是，车辆造成交通事故后责任主体无法确定，以及确定后责任方能否作为主体承担责任的问题。简单来说，就是自动驾驶汽车发生事故后，应该如何判定事故责任的问题。\n无论是这次的Autopilot事件，还是前不久的Model 3事件，抑或是其他品牌自动驾驶汽车的驾驶事故，都引发了类似的争议。\n针对这一问题，国内外的学者进行了大量讨论。例如，G. E. Marchant和R. A. Lindor就认为提出，在自动驾驶场景中，无论是部分自动驾驶还是完全自动驾驶，自动驾驶系统与驾驶员之间的责任分配通常都会异常困难。\n他们分析了传统的事故场景，认为常见的交通事故的原因主要由驾驶员、车辆故障和不可避免的自然状况引起，而前两者所对应的主体—驾驶员和汽车制造商—通常是潜在的责任主体。\n这种责任的判定在传统场景下是相对容易的，然而在自动驾驶场景，尤其是level3的不完全自动驾驶场景中，的责任分配会异常困难。\n除此之外，F. Douma和S. Palodichuk、司晓和曹建峰、袁曾等研究者也更广泛地讨论了厂商、驾驶员、保险公司等各潜在责任主体在自动驾驶事故责任场景下，所应当承担的责任。 \n简单来说，在传统人工驾驶方式下，由车辆所造成的交通事故中，车辆的控制者与责任主体是一致的，因此责任的判定较为简单。\n\n\n但是在自动驾驶方式下，情况却完全不同。\n所谓控制者指的是，当事故发生时交通工具的实际操作者。在传统驾驶场景中，驾驶员无疑就是车辆的控制者。一旦由于车辆驾驶原因发生交通事故，驾驶员作为控制者应当承担相应的责任 ( 当然，驾驶员也可能在事故发生后依法无责或免责) 。此时，驾驶员便是交通事故中的责任主体。并且其理由正是因为驾驶员为汽车的实际控制者。\n但是在自动驾驶汽车的情况中，控制者并不仅仅是驾驶员。SAE 分级体系认为，自动驾驶汽车的分类标准包括三个因素: 控制者、环境监控主体、系统支持的驾驶模式。\nSAE 分级体系下，不同阶段的控制者的变化: \n\n当有了自动驾驶系统参与，进入自动驾驶汽车阶段 ( 即 Level 1) 之后，控制者便有了两种可能: 驾驶员和自动驾驶系统。当然有了两种控制者，并不意味着在确定责任主体时一定会出现问题。但是，当分析 SAE 分级体系所体现出自动驾驶汽车发展各阶段的状况时，我们会发现，责任主体问题 在某些阶段一定会发生。这不是自动驾驶系统能否担当责任主体的问题，也不是汽车厂商、保险公 司、汽车使用者的责任分配问题，而是责任主体模糊从而无法进行事故归责的问题。尤其是在Level 3中，责任判定问题最为险峻。\n因此，我们可以看到的是，在大多数的自动驾驶事故中，所引发的争议主要就是在事故发生的时候，其实际的控制主题究竟是驾驶员还是自动驾驶系统。\n驾驶员会推诿说自动驾驶系统没有给出足够的预警、自动驾驶系统没有给出充分的控制转让的时间、自动驾驶系统转让控制权限后驾驶员的操控失灵、自动驾驶系统所带来的不同操作体验引发了事故…\n而自动驾驶厂商则会说，驾驶员没有严格遵守辅助驾驶的各种规则、驾驶员没有能够集中注意力、驾驶员没有做到环境监控的义务…\n双方都有诸多的理由，但是由于我们现在还没有形成对自动驾驶事故场景进行完善的鉴定、判定流程，同时也没有能够对双方的义务进行明确且反复的教育与界定，因此才导致了现在自动驾驶事故中出现的种种争议。\n\n\n更多的的讨论可以关注我之前的一些回答：\n南京一特斯拉司机早高峰开自动驾驶脱把睡觉，这一行为违法吗？如何看待目前的「自动驾驶」技术？\nL5 真的能实现吗？或者说，未来无人驾驶真的会成为常态吗？\n如果未来交通工具都是自动驾驶，你能做到安心出行吗？\n复旦教授杨珉公开质疑理想汽车「自动驾驶安全性没有想象的那么香，事关人命」，目前阶段的自动驾驶靠谱吗？\n\n\n以及这个视频：\n【德国博士】完全无人驾驶有可能实现么？L5安全性悖论及未来智慧城市出行的展望\n\n参考文献\n\nhttps://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/self-driving-car-statistics/\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety\n\n\n留德华叫兽\n点击下载\n86 个回答，查看全部。\n喝了酒以后，让特斯拉自动驾驶，算酒驾吗？\n美国的联邦法律是如何产生的？",

          "description": "何为黑色电影之黑\n法国影评人定义了黑色电影，他们从四十年代美国电影中归纳出这种风格。到五十年代末，奥逊·威尔斯执导的[历劫佳人]宣告了经典黑色电影时期的终结，随之而来的是所谓的新黑色电影——彩色取代黑白、黑色元素和主题融入某个类型化叙事中——犯罪、惊悚、科幻、恐怖等。黑色电影概念包含了一系列视觉和影像风格以及特定的主题——犯罪和荒诞。所谓黑色，既强调视觉，也强调叙事和主题。\n\n从社会性源起来说，黑色电影是对二三十年代约翰·福特、弗兰克·卡普拉等导演所信奉的美国中产社会价值的反叛。底层、中产阶级、警察、女人等，或是陷入腐化堕落的罪恶环境，或是走向犯罪深渊。黑色电影虽然鲜少直接谈论宏大的政治、社会问题，但它们或多或少从这些问题中，产生了创作的冲动和灵感。源自人性的贪婪和腐败是导致主角犯罪或堕落的根本原因。\n回看美国经典黑色电影，“黑色”之意并不难领略。它们大多是讲犯罪故事，或是与人性的阴暗面有关，让人感到既危险又迷人。主角只是普通人，而非穷凶极恶的帮派人物，或是被逼无奈的反抗者。\n一般来说，1941年的[马耳他之鹰]在好莱坞刮起了黑色电影之风。从类型上来看，它是一部侦探电影，但具备了与该类型电影不同的黑色主题——不是聚焦于一般意义上的犯罪或悬疑解密，而是透过侦探之手，发现罪恶背后，道德和人性的失衡。\n\n当侦探、女主和犯罪团伙的老大围在传说中用金子制作的马耳他之鹰周围时，他们的目光聚集了贪欲，但影片在此又狠狠黑色了一把：众人搭上几条性命，互相欺骗和斗争而争夺回来的宝物，却是一文不值的东西。\n这种历经千帆后，被宿命击中的荒诞，亦是黑色电影迷人的地方。与女主暧昧的侦探，最终向警察告发了她的罪行。这是早期黑色电影的“保守”之处(因为海斯法典，好莱坞当时对性、变态、犯罪、暴力的表现还有很多禁忌)，摇摆的道德最后要回到正轨，作恶者自食其果。\n在[双重赔偿][失去的周末]和[日落大道]里，导…",

          "description": "Linux 命令行以生产力强而闻名。它也是一个可以获得一些乐趣的地方！\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n去年 11 月，我们分享了一篇文章《7 个好玩的 Linux 命令》，并请读者们告诉我们推荐的“好玩”的 Linux 命令是什么，以及为什么？\n\r\n一些读者在下面分享了他们的最爱：\n\r\n\r\n这是我的最爱：\n\r\n\r\n当然得有 cowsay！\n\r\nfortune，我最喜欢的 “黑科技” 是让用户连接时的 motd 成为一个幽默的格言。\n\r\nsl，在你的终端上的蒸汽机车。\n\r\nxsnow，另一个 XWindow 黑科技，这个命令可以在你的工作区降雪，并堆积在打开的窗口上。\n\r\nGNOME 复活节彩蛋，在 GNOME 2 中，按下 Alt+F2（打开运行对话框）并输入 free the fish，就可以在你的根窗口中释放 “Wanda the Fish”。如果你点击 Wanda，它就会四处游荡，窜来窜去（一段时间）。\n\r\n\r\n~Dave Neary\n\r\n\r\n我的一天从这些开始:\n\r\nfortune、cowsay、lolcat\n\r\n\n\r\n紧接着是 curl wttr.in。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在我们可以喝咖啡了 ;-）\n\r\n~Tomasz Waraksa\n\r\n\r\ncmatrix ，因为每当这个时候，你就会觉得自己被插入了机器。\n\r\n~Gary Smith\n\r\n\r\ntelnet towel.blinkenlights.nl\r\n\n\r\n这并不完全是 Linux 特有的，但它还挺棒的。\n\r\n~John 'Warthog9' Hawley\n\r\n\r\nXroach 是 20 世纪 90 年代你的窗口管理器的一个很酷的附加功能。当时它与 Tab Window Manager （TWM）和 F Virtual Window Manager （FVWM）一起使用时非常有趣，但我已经多年没有使用它了。当你运行 Xroach 时，它添加了小蟑螂并“住”在你的窗口下。当你移动一个窗口或关闭它时，蟑螂就会窜到另一个窗口下躲起来或跑出屏幕。这只是其中一种使桌面更有趣的小方法。\n\r\n看起来有一个 Xroach 的现代移植，我得找个时间试试。\n\r\n~Jim Hall\n\r\n\r\n我在 90 年代末担任过计算机科学的助教，我们的计算机实验室里有 Sun Sparc 工作站。有时学生会在实验室时间里走开而不锁屏。每隔一段时间，我就会在他们不注意的时候在终端上执行 xroach &; clear。\n\r\nXRoach 是个好东西。蟑螂躲在窗口下，在屏幕上窜来窜去，当你移动一个窗口时，又躲在另一个窗口下。\n\r\n~Ann Marie Fred\n\r\n\r\n我最喜欢的一个是 hollywood，在 这里 了解下。\n\r\n只需运行它并开始随意按键，你就会让星巴克的每个人都相信你正在摧毁美国。\n\r\n~Clint Byrum\n\r\nJim Hall 对此回应道：\n\r\n这真是太棒了! 这让我想起了 Hacker Typer。它是一个网站而不是一个终端程序。只要调出网站，然后敲击键盘。不管你输入什么，Hacker Typer 的输出都似乎是真正的工作。:-）\n\r\n为了回应 Clint Byrum（和 Jim Hall 的回应）带来的乐趣：\n\r\n这两个我都喜欢! 请欣赏这篇关于 Hollywood 黑科技的 博文。我最爱之一。\n\r\n~Greg Scott\n\r\n\r\n你最喜欢的“有趣的” Linux 命令是什么？请在下面的评论中分享你的。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/fun-linux-commands\n\r\n作者：Opensource.com 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "洋葱新闻：“Linus 发现 Windows XP 很棒”\n\r\nLinux 创始人 Linus Torvalds 在 GitHub 上的 Linux 仓库的 README 中写道：“我删除了Linux，因为我讨厌它，现在我认为它很糟糕。你应该去使用这个很棒的操作系统，它叫 Windows XP，我刚刚发现它很棒。”，这个文件的 URL 是 https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/8bcab0346d4fcf21b97046eb44db8cf37ddd6da0 ，没错，看起来是 Linux 的仓库地址。好吧，这是一个洋葱新闻。事实上，这是一个 GitHub 的 bug，任何人都可以通过伪造 URL 而看起来像是另外的仓库和另外的作者。而这个 Bug 由来已久，但是 GitHub 从未准备修复。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：无论 GitHub 基于什么理由不修复，但是通过这个漏洞可以制作出以假乱真的钓鱼信息，大家一定要注意。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n最新版 macOS 12.3 终于移除了 Python 2 的支持\n\r\n苹果释出了 macOS Monterey 12.3 Beta，一个主要变化是 不再捆绑 Python 2.7。苹果建议开发者使用 Python 3 或替代语言。Python 语言项目在 2020 年 1 月 1 日停止支持 Python 2 分支，接替 Python 2 的 Python 3 早在 2008 年就已经发布，但由于它不向后兼容，导致许多用户仍然停留在 Python 2 分支。但 macOS 也没有预装 Python 3，开发者可选择安装捆绑 Python 3 的 Xcode 开发工具。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：如果 Python 3 能对 Python 2 提供更多的兼容性，而不是弃之如敝履，就不会有这么多的产品和服务还留在 Python 2。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nOpenSea 称其上免费创建的 NFT 80% 都是垃圾或剽窃作品\n\r\n占有绝对垄断地位的 NFT 市场 OpenSea 宣布，它将限制用户在平台上使用其工具免费创建 NFT 的次数为 50 次。这些免费创建的 NFT 可以跳过支付区块链燃料费用，而在售出时由买家支付。之后在社区的反对之下，OpenSea 又宣布取消这一限制，同时也给出了做此限制的 理由：用这个免费工具创建的项目中，超过 80% 是抄袭作品、虚假收藏和垃圾内容。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实我觉得这种对免费创建的限制是有道理的，要不 OpenSea 可能会沦为垃圾场。",

          "description": "Bitsy 是一个开源电子游戏设计软件。 其简约的功能使任何人都可以探索他们的创造力。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n有许多游戏设计程序和各种游戏设计方法，但对我来说，最突出的是 Bitsy。Bitsy 由 Adam Le Doux 在 2017 年创建，在 MIT 许可下发布，用其创造者的话说，Bitsy 是：“一个用于小游戏或世界的编辑器。其目标是使制作游戏变得容易，在那里你可以四处走动，与人交谈，并到某个地方。”\n\r\n安装 Bitsy\n\r\nBitsy 是用 JavaScript 编写的，可以制作 HTML5 游戏。你可以从 GitHub 或 它的创造者的网站 下载它。它很小，很容易学习，有独特的位图艺术风格，有意在功能上有所欠缺，而且能做的事情有限。\n\r\n尽管（也许是因为）这些限制，Bitsy 自发布以来吸引了一个充满活力的用户社区。用户对 Bitsy 采取的两个主要方法是：接受限制和寻求突破限制，看看你能走多远。\n\r\n创意的界限\n\r\nBitsy 的局限性意味着接受这些局限性仍能制作出令人满意的游戏，这就成为一个需要创造性和创造力的挑战。你可以在 Itch.io 网站 上看到和玩一些用 Bitsy 制作的令人印象深刻的游戏。同时，人们也想出了一些黑科技、调整和扩展。这些都在不牺牲 Bitsy 的本质的前提下突破了一些限制。\n\r\nBitsy 的基本元素是一个代表玩家的头像、发生游戏动作的房间、精灵（可以与之互动的非玩家角色）和物品。有一个用于创建这些元素的位图编辑器，它也支持简单的两帧动画。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bitsy 中工作依赖于条件变量，而不是成熟的脚本，这使得没有编码背景的人容易学习，但有时会让那些期待更多灵活性的人感到沮丧。\n\r\n如果你想了解 Bitsy 的基本情况，你可以在创作者的网站上了解，或者下载并在本地运行。\n\r\n\n\r\n文档\n\r\n关于 Bitsy 的文档并不是只有一个地方可以去看。如果你想看 Bitsy 的操作，可以在 YouTube 上找到各种短视频。我更喜欢基于文本的教程，我发现最有用的三个资源是：\n\r\n\r\nItch.io 网站上提供的官方 Bitsy 教程，作者是 Claire Morwood\n\r\nBitsy workshop PDF， 由用户 haraiva 提供\n\r\nBitsy 变量， 教程由用户 ayolland 编写\n\r\n\r\n阅读这些教程，尝试一些 Bitsy 游戏，并开始创造你自己的东西。开始时要保持简单。当你熟悉了 Bitsy，你可能想研究一下人们为它创造的一些 工具、黑科技和扩展。\n\r\n它也是教育工作者的完美工具，甚至还有教育工作者 Hal Meeks 的 Bitsy 课程 可供在线学习。\n\r\n你还可以在 Itch.io 网站 上找到人们为 Bitsy 制作的大量游戏资源。\n\r\nTwine 整合\n\r\n你可能已经尝试过流行的基于浏览器的游戏开发工具 Twine。你可以将 Bitsy 与 Twine 不同程度地整合。整合的范围可以从简单地将 Bitsy 游戏放在一个 iframe 中显示在你的 Twine 游戏中，到在两个引擎之间共享变量和对话命令，让你在 Bitsy 游戏中执行基本的 Twine 命令！如果你对这些感兴趣，那么请看：\n\r\n\r\n结合 Bitsy 和 Twine 的教程\n\r\nBitsy 黑科技\n\r\nFreya 的 Twisty 模板\n\r\n\r\n给初学者的 Bitsy\n\r\n初学者很容易入门 Bitsy，无论你是编程新手还是仅仅是游戏设计的新手。有了它，你可以探索它在激发创造力、想象力和创造性方面的所有可能性。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/bitsy-game-design\n\r\n作者：Peter Cheer 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Revolt 是一个有前途的自由开源的 Discord 替代品。在这里，让我们看一下它所提供的东西以及它的初步印象。\n\r\n\r\nDiscord 是一个功能丰富的协作平台，主要为游戏玩家量身定做。尽管你可以在 Linux 上毫无问题地使用 Discord，但它仍然是一个专有解决方案。\n\r\n你可以选择使用 Element 作为一个开源的解决方案协作平台，但它不是一个替代品。\n\r\n但是，Revolt 是一个令人印象深刻的 Discord 替代品，它是开源的。\n\r\n\r\n注意：\n\r\nRevolt 正处于公开测试阶段，不提供任何移动应用。它可能缺乏一些你在 Discord 上找到的基本功能。\n\r\n\r\n我会重点说一下 Revolt 的功能，以及它是否可以成为 Linux 上 Discord 的替代品。\n\r\n一个你可以自行托管的开源 Discord 替代品\n\r\n\n\r\nRevolt 不仅仅是一个简单的开源替代品，而且你还可以自我托管。\n\r\n它确实缺少 Discord 提供的各种功能，但你可以获得许多基本功能，可以先体验一下。\n\r\n即使缺乏一些功能，但它也是一个功能丰富的开源客户端。让我们来看看现有的功能。\n\r\nRevolt 的功能\n\r\n\n\r\n它看起来和感觉已经很像 Discord，这是一些关键的亮点：\n\r\n\r\n能够创建你自己的服务器\n\r\n创建文字频道和语音频道\n\r\n在服务器中分配用户角色\n\r\n调整主题（深色/浅色）\n\r\n改变强调色\n\r\n从可用选项中管理字体和表情包\n\r\n支持自定义 CSS\n\r\n能够添加机器人\n\r\n易于管理文本/语音频道的权限\n\r\n向其他用户发送朋友请求\n\r\n保存的笔记\n\r\n能够控制通知\n\r\n支持硬件加速\n\r\n专门的桌面设置\n\r\n使用 Docker 进行自我托管\n\r\n用户状态和自定义状态支持\n\r\n\r\n因此，作为处于公开测试阶段的东西，它听起来对初学者来说非常好。你已经拥有了大部分的核心功能，但你可能想等着看它成为一个成熟的 Discord 替代品。\n\r\n使用 Revolt 的初步印象\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你使用过 Discord，用户体验会感觉很熟悉。这是一件好事。\n\r\n对于这篇快速亮点介绍，我没有比较 Discord 和 Revolt 的资源使用情况，因为它仍然处于测试阶段，不是同等级的比较。\n\r\n然而，在我简短的测试中，它感觉很快速，除了第一次加载一个文本频道时。在发表这篇文章时，它没有双因素认证（2FA）功能，但应该会在他们的第一个里程碑（第一版）版本中添加。\n\r\n\n\r\n一些功能如用户状态、权限管理和外观调整看起来很有用。但是，当涉及到语音频道时，它和 Discord 的工作方式不一样，至少现在是这样。\n\r\n我不知道他们是否打算用同样的方式，但 Discord 的语音频道功能是直观的、快速的，而且有更好的控制。\n\r\n不要忘了，Discord 还提供 “Discord Stage”，这是一个类似 Clubhouse 的音频聊天室功能。\n\r\n其他一些我找不到的功能包括：\n\r\n\r\n对信息作出反应的能力\n\r\n抑制噪音的功能\n\r\n改变服务器\n\r\n服务器日志\n\r\n各种有用的机器人\n\r\n\r\n当然，要赶上 Discord 提供的功能还需要大量的时间，但至少我们现在有一个开源的 Discord 解决方案。\n\r\n你可以了解他们的 项目路线图/发布跟踪器，看看你可以在其最终/未来的版本中期待什么。\n\r\n在 Linux 中安装 Revolt\n\r\nRevolt 可用于 Linux 和 Windows。你可以选择在你的网络浏览器上使用它，而不需要一个单独的应用。\n\r\n但是，如果你需要在你的桌面上使用它，他们提供了一个 AppImage 文件和一个 deb 包，你可以从它的 GitHub 发布页 下载。\n\r\n如果你是 Linux 的新手，可以参考我们关于 使用 AppImage 文件 和 安装 deb 包 的资源来开始学习。\n\r\n如果你想用你的错误报告和建议来帮助他们改进，请随时前往 反馈页面。此外，你还可以浏览他们的 GitHub 页面 以了解更多信息。\n\r\n\r\nRevolt\n\r\n\r\n你觉得 Revolt 怎么样？你认为它有可能成为 Linux 上 Discord 的一个很好的开源替代品吗？\n\r\n请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法!\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/revolt/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "前言 最近，在朋友圈各路大神的强烈安利之下，入坑了《开端》。不得不说，华语影视剧领域已经很久没有出现过这种带有科幻元素而又逻辑通畅的剧集了。在《开端》中，男女主角搭上了一辆载有一颗炸弹的 45 路公交车。一旦他们因为爆炸或是睡着而失去意识，便会发生时间倒流，他们也会重新回到还未爆炸的公交车上。主角团需要在这一次又一次的循环中，找到解救全车乘客的方法。这种无限时间循环的题材在以往国外的科幻剧作中并不少见，比较出名的例子有《源代码》、《忌日快乐》等。然而，《开端》仍然以新颖的剧情设计、严谨精致的细节与伏笔而广受好评。无论是在原著小说还是影视剧中，作者都没有提及时间循环发生的技术原理。因此，本文将尝试补全这一物理背景。我们将根据物理学家马尔达西那 (Juan Martin Maldacena, 1968－now) 与萨斯坎德 (Leonard Susskind, 1940－now) 于 2013 年发表的 ER = EPR 原理，阐述如何构造一台可能可以实现时光回溯的时间机器。\n我们的基本逻辑是这样的：首先，在两个不同时刻制造处于量子纠缠状态的基本粒子；然后通过 ER = EPR 原理将这些纠缠粒子转化为连接这两个不同时刻的虫洞。这样，两位主角就可以在满足触发条件时，通过虫洞返回到炸弹还未爆炸时的公交车上。这种逻辑设定可以合理地解释为何会发生时间循环，以及为何循环不会提前到炸弹上车之前、为何肖的身体状态会越来越差等一系列原作者挖了却又填不上的坑。不过在此之前，我们需要先了解一下虫洞、量子纠缠、ER = EPR 等基础概念。\n黑洞、白洞、虫洞\n如果你关注科幻，那么我相信你一定不会对黑洞 (black hole) 这个概念感到陌生。在 2014 年上映的《星际穿越》中，科学顾问基普·索恩 (Kip Thorne, 1940－now) 及其团队利用数值相对论的计算为我们还原了一个相当真…",

          "description": "为了能够用两个微信彻底分离工作和生活，又苦于 iPhone 不能双开微信，我开始使用 Android 手机作为工作备用机，无奈之下加入了双机党的阵营。\n我有两个号码： A 和 B，因为号码 A 流量多，就把它留在了主力机上，号码 B 挪到了备用机。可大部分服务都是用号码 B 注册的，使用主力机时，时常因为各种原因，需要填写号码 B 收到的短信验证码，此时又得拿起备用机查看验证码。如此反复，真的令人非常不爽。\n为此我开始寻找 Android 短信转发的解决方案，最终通过 SmsForwarder + Bark 解决了这个问题，经过一段时间的使用，效果非常不错。现在我把这个 Android 手机短信转发给 iPhone 的方案分享给大家，有需要的朋友可以作为参考。\n短信转发至 iPhone 效果\n在 iPhone 中安装 Bark App\n🔗 下载地址：App Store\nBark 是一款 Apple 生态内的自定义推送服务，它充分利用了 Apple 推送通知服务 (APNs) 进行工作，原理是将自定义推送内容通过 发送端 > Bark 服务端 > 苹果 APNs 服务器 > 你的设备 > Bark App 进行传递。由于完全依赖 Apple 推送通知服务，App 本身无需前台运行，几乎不会对 iPhone 的续航产生影响。\n第一次打开 Bark App 时，会自动为你的设备生成 key ，复制 App 首页自动生成的第一个带有 key 参数的 URL 备用。\nBark App\n在 Android 手机中安装短信转发器 SmsForwarder\n🔗 下载地址：酷安\nSmsForwarder 是我在酷安找到的开源 Android 短信转发工具，它有一个简单直白的中文名称「短信转发器」，这款 App 在转发短信时，能设置转发模板，还能对短信内容设置多种筛选条件，可以利用钉钉、飞书、邮箱、企业微信、Server 酱、Telegram 等多种渠道进行推送。\n打开「短信转发器」，依次点击「发送通道」-「添加发送通道」，选择「Bark」，填入上一步在 iPhone 端 Bark App 中生成的推送地址，点击「确定」保存设置。\n将Bark设置为发送通道\n返回 App 首页，点击「转发规则」-「添加短信转发」，设置好你自己的短信转发规则。比如：当你只想转发备用机的验证码短信时，可以将短信内容匹配关键字设置为「验证码」，这样只有包含验证码的短信才会被转发，其他诸如广告营销、公益宣传等内容的短信则不会被转发。此处也可以根据自己的需要添加其他规则。\n设置短信转发规则\n除了转发短信，SmsForwarder 还可以转发 Android 手机的未接来电和应用通知，因为与本文主题无关，感兴趣的朋友可以自行下载体验。\n为 SmsForwarder 设置应用权限 ⚠️\n出于续航因素考虑，Android 手机的后台策略都非常保守，致使 SmsForwarder 在后台运行时，容易被系统 kill 软件后台进程。为保证短信转发功能的正常运作，需要在手机系统中设置好 App 的自启动、后台运行、电池优化等必要权限。由于各品牌手机的设置方式存在差异，在此不做详细说明。\n示例：realme UI 后台权限设置\n出于隐私角度考虑，一些国内的定制系统会默认隐藏包含验证码的短信，第三方应用即使被授予短信权限，也无法读取到这类型的短信。因此需要在手机短信设置中关闭相关防护功能，此类短信才能被读取并转发至其他设备。\nrealme UI 验证码安全保护\n将 Android 手机收到的验证码转发至 Mac\n根据同样的原理，你也可以在 Mac App Store 中搜索安装 Bark，生成推送地址后，在 SmsForwarder 中将其设置为第二个推送通道。这样你就可以在 iPhone 和 Mac 上同时收到来自 Android 手机的验证码短信，方便你在使用 Mac 时填写验证码。\n总结\n得益于Apple 推送通知服务的稳定性，无论是 WiFi 还是蜂窝数据，这一套短信转发方案几乎都没有延迟，使用起来非常的方便。缺点是两台设备必须都要联网才能实现转发和接收，而且只能从 Android 转发短信到 iPhone，反向无效。\n如果对 Bark 提供的后端服务有隐私方面的顾虑，你也可以通过该项目在 GitHub 公开的后端代码自行搭建后端服务。除了本文中提到的 Bark，你还可以使用 PushDeer 等其他类似的推送服务进行转发，工作原理和配置方法也是类似的。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n扫码分享",

Kapt won't work.\n很多同学知难而退，被迫回滚到4.1.3，那怎么行呢？\n分析\n首先说，这个错误不是组件化插件的问题，不是Kotlin的问题，也不是工程本身的代码问题，而是JDK没配置好导致的。\n但是有人会问了，为什么旧版Studio用得好好的，升级到新版就有JDK的问题了？因为新版Studio默认内置了JDK 11，Gradle会使用11来运行，放弃了JDK 8（细心的同学已经发现，启动界面的Runtime version已经变成了11，不再是8了）。\n如果不做任何设置，默认用JDK 11来编译工程，就会失败，当然错误提示不会是上面那个，是另一个，这里不赘述，我们还是以JDK 8来编译。\n解决\n1、我们先打开Studio的偏好设置（Preferences），然后修改Gradle JDK为1.8。\n一般来说它会检测你系统安装的JDK，如果没有，你就手动Add一下，Add到Home那一层，图中我的路径都是JDK的默认安装路径（我的JDK当初都是用brew直接install的openjdk）。\n\n2、设置好之后，还要记得配置你的终端环境变量，这个是为了保证整个系统环境（包括脚本命令执行）都使用JDK 8，否则版本不一致也会出问题。\n如果是bash就修改.bashrc，我是用的zsh，所以编辑.zshrc：\nvim ~/.zshrc\n\n追加内容：\nexport CLASSPATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home/lib\nexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n保存并退出。\n3、重启Studio，尝试Rebuild工程，如果没有问题，那恭喜你，不用继续往下看了。\n当然，绝大多数情况，就会出现本文最开始那个错误提示：找不到tools.jar。我们知道，这个jar包是JDK lib目录下面的：\n\n既然环境变量也配置了，怎么就提示错误呢？\n4、后来在网上搜了一下，发现是默认JDK的目录命名符号有问题，其实上面看到的 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-8.jdk 是个软链接，指向的真实路径是：\n/usr/local/Cellar/openjdk@8/1.8.0+282/libexec/openjdk.jdk\n注意到里面的+号没有，这个玩意儿就是祸首。接下来我们修正错误：\ncd /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk@8/\n# 把+改成_\nmv 1.8.0+282 1.8.0_282\n# 去修正软链接，如果提示已存在就先sudo rm删掉\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk@8/1.8.0_282/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-8.jdk\n\n此时再重新做一次上述第1步，设置JDK为1.8，再次Rebuild编译（建议先File → Invalidate Caches一下），成功。\n总结\n其实主要原因还是JDK配置的问题，可能新版Studio的Gradle在处理路径或者符号链接上面做了什么奇葩改动。\n理论上讲，如果你的JDK本身就配置得非常完美，那么只需要做好第1步，就不会有其他问题了。\n升级后部分UI中文变方块，解决办法是修改一下字体即可（Preferences → Appearance → Use custom font）。",
