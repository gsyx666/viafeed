A abreviação será \"border\".\n \nA propriedade \"outline-color\" é muito parecida com a propriedade de borda, porém, o outline serve para marcar/contornar o elemento que está em foco na página caso o usuário queira passar pelos itens usando o teclado e não o mouse.\nAssim como a borda, o outline-color também precisa da definição da largura e do tipo do contorno para assim refletir a cor. A sua abreviação é \"outline\".\n \nNormalmente as cores de outline ficam ocultas no código e apenas são visíveis quando o elemento de fato estiver em foco na página, de acordo com a navegação do usuário.\n \nA propriedade \"outline-offset\" adiciona um espaço transparente entre o contorno e a borda do elemento.\n\nCódigo do botão:\nCodepen\nDocumentação CSS:\nMDN Web Docs\nw3schools",

And when things feel intellectually lazy, it's usually an omen that relevant bugs will turn their ugly head when you're least expecting.\nThe distinction that I always hear between abstract (aka \"double\") and strict (aka \"triple\") equality in JS is that triple equality checks the data type while double equality does not, thus making triple equality more useful. \nbelow is how each comparison process takes place according to the JS spec.\nabstract/double equality:\n\nstrict/triple equality:\n\nAs you can…",

          "description": "The prospect of launching a website still feels incredibly exhilarating — even for those who have already launched numerous websites in the past.\nBut if you’re new to the game, you may have conducted some research and found that some web developers prefer to code websites in HTML, while others prefer to use something called a CMS (Content Management System).\nWhat is HTML?\nWithout HTML, we would have web pages that would look no less interesting than a page of unformatted text. HTML allows us to add style to text, insert and format images, embed video, customize fonts, add color, and a whole lot more.\nThe example below shows you the HTML coding for Core dna’s homepage:\n\nWhat is a Content Management System (CMS)?\nCommon CMS’ include Tumblr, WordPress, Joomla, Wix, and Drupal.\nOn the more advanced side of the spectrum, you’ll find ECM (Enterprise Content Management), which does everything a web CMS does, and then some. It supplements a typical web CMS features by facilitating collaboration in the workplace by integrating digital asset management, eCommerce, and document management into the mix. Going a step further, you’ll notice how most ECMs are becoming DXPs (Digital Experience Platforms), which help brands personalize content, deliver content to IoT devices, and much more.\nCMS vs HTML: What is the difference?\nYou see, with a CMS, you can often use pre-built templates to launch web pages more quickly. You can then customize those templates to make them your own. This is obviously a lot faster than coding something from scratch, and is especially useful if you have no coding knowledge.\nBut besides that, there are some significant differences between HTML-only websites and CMS-powered websites.\nFind out more at Core dna's blog on CMS vs HTML: Why Us a Content Management System?",

Feedback is powered to a considerable degree by tests.\nWhen tests slow development down, engineering teams lose momentum and become frustrated, because they can’t meet their goals. A slow test suite puts the brakes on CI/CD, making release and deployment more difficult. This often means that organizations can't ship out products on time, and risk losing their competitive edge.\nChoosing a scalable cloud platform like Semaphore is a great start.

Screen readers often use a different sound library for each language they support. They can easily switch between those sound libraries, but only when a webpage specifies which language to use.\nTypically in your average Next.js website, the deployed page ships only a <html> wrapped site, with no language attribute attached.\nIf you were writing a plain HTML website (or using some other library that allows you to update the shipped HTML files), it would be a simple matter of adding a lang=\"en\" to your outputted HTML, like so:\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\nWith Next.js, it's a little bit more involved, but luckily not too difficult!\nInside of your pages/ directory (or wherever you put your page components), make a file called _document.js.

          "description": "I am 31 years old and I didn't knew this. Everytime I wanted to scrape some data table from a website I had to run a script to do it for me, when in fact it was so easy... like a walk in a park.\nLet's have a brief example of what I mean. So how do you go from this...\n\nto this...\n\n... in less than 10 seconds.\nAll you need is the page you want to get the data from, in my case it's this one, and the  Excel app opened (you can use Google drive as well).\nWe will use the IMPORTXML function which takes as parameters an url, an xpath_query and a locale. All we need is to pass the url and the xpath_query of the table.\nOur single line of code will look like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//tr\")\n\n\nSo basically we are telling the program to fetch any table row from the page and display it in our sheet. Easy, right?\nRemember that you can modify the xpath_query to fetch anything from the page.  For example, if I want to fetch the 22nd row of the table I change the function like this:\n=IMPORTXML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\", \"//table[1]/tbody/tr[24]\")\n\nIsn't it awesome? I bet it is. Hope you've learned something! :)",

We do run into the case of repeated numerals causing an issue III, but we can clear that by multiplying num by any number between 2 and 4 before comparing it to res, since the numerals jump in value by 5x.\nOnce we know how to properly identify a subtractive numeral, it's a simple matter to just iterate in reverse through given numeral to find and return the res.\nfunction romanToInt(s: string): number {\n  let res: number = 0;\n  const symbols = {\n    I: 1,\n    V: 5,\n    X: 10,\n    L: 50,\n    C: 100,\n    D: 500,\n    M: 1000,\n  };\n  s.split(\"\")\n    .reverse()\n    .forEach((char) => {\n      let val: number = parseInt(symbols[char]);\n      if (res > 4 * val) {\n        res -= val;\n      } else {\n        res += val;\n      }\n    });\n  return res;\n}\n\nThis solution uses a lookup table composed which can help in easier conversion and much simple compared to the above one.\nfunction intToRoman(num: number): string {\n  let res:string = \"\";\n  const value:number [] = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];\n  const numerals:string [] = [\"M\",\"CM\",\"D\",\"CD\",\"C\",\"XC\",\"L\",\"XL\",\"X\",\"IX\",\"V\",\"IV\",\"I\"]\n  for (let i = 0; num; i++)\n    while (num >= value[i]){\n        res += numerals[i];\n         num -= value[i];\n    }\n  return res;\n}\n\nHere I have tried to solve them in typescript using ts-problems repo.\n🔁 original post at 🔗 Dev Post",

          "description": "A great way to level up any application your building is to create a simple loading animation. Today, we're going to make use of free resources and pure CSS to create a loading animation of our own.\nOf course, this is not integrated with anything. Integrating the spinner with actual loading time in the app is a whole other tutorial, but for now, we're going to worry about creating the actual spinner!\n\nFor this spinner I got this simple spinner of Pixabay (thanks gorkhs).\nWe start with just a very simple structure in our html.\n<div class=\"spinner\">\n  <img src=\"./rainbow.png\" class=\"img\"/>\n</div>\n\nTip: Make sure you include the correct path and name to your image.\nTo create the animation, we will use keyframes and the transform property. Below, we'll create a keyframe animation called spin:\n @keyframes spin {\n   0% {\n     transform: rotate(0deg);\n   }\n   100% {\n     transform: rotate(360deg);\n   }\n }\n\nNow, let's style our actual spinner!\n\nWe created a div that contains the image in our HTML file, and assigned it the class of spinner. We will give it the following properties:\n .spinner {\n   height: 100vh;\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n }\n\nNow, for the actual image:\n .img {\n   height: 150px;\n   animation: spin 2.5s linear infinite;\n }\n\nNow we have a working spinner!\nWant to see the full tutorial? Watch the YouTube video below or watch in on CodeCast to get access to all the code in the Player!\n\n\n\n\nFor more of my content, follow me on like Twitter & CodeCast! \nYou can also read my last blog here:\nCreate A Portfolio Website with only HTML & CSS\nAmy Oulton ・ Jan 13 ・ 4 min read\n#html\n        #css\n        #webdev\n        #codenewbie\n      \n.",

          "description": "今天，紫川动画第九集开播，猪期待已久的帝都流血夜剧情终于出来了。\n    帝都流血夜是紫川第一部的高潮，也是三兄弟性格展现、人性冲突的一场剧，三人今后的道路和命运都在这一夜被决定了，可以说是紫川第一部里最重要的戏份了。\n    因为故事激烈，猪当年是写得很舒畅的。感谢动画制作团队的用心，将这一幕剧情呈现得很符合猪心意，尤其是将总长参星的狠辣和阴险表现得很到位，将原作里一些遗漏和缺陷的情节也做了弥补，猪很是满意，中午和猪老婆一起美滋滋地看了动画，感觉甚是意得志满。\n     但孔圣人是怎么说的？天下唯女人难缠也！不学无术的猪老婆甚是可恶，看完以后居然大发厥辞，说动画很精彩，但原作写得太粗糙简单，破绽太多！\n这蠢婆娘专门抬杠，差点把猪给气死。\n猪婆娘蠢言论：“这场政变虎头蛇尾，这么简单就被平定了，杨明华是送死来的，他根本就一点胜算都没有，本就不应该发动这场叛乱的！”\n猪：错！在杨明华看来，他的优势很大！\n政变前，帝都的武装力量本来有三部分：中央军，是帝都最大也是最强的武装力量，足有十万兵马，军团长雷迅，是杨明华的亲信；禁卫军，约一万来人，负责总长府的保卫，是忠于总长的；另外还有负责城内秩序的总监察厅宪兵部队，人数也是数千人，是总监察长萧龙统带。至于其他的治部少治安警察在这里基本只有当观众的份了。\n本来，总长紫川参星一直就是靠禁军和监察厅的宪兵，才勉强和掌握中央军的杨明华维持了一个危险的弱势平衡，但政变之前，总监察长萧龙被杨明华拉拢了过去，帝都城内局势陡然失衡，何况杨明华还召来了帝林统带的远东边军呢？在政变前的杨明华看来，自己掌握了帝都城内、城外的三大部队，对付只有万把人的禁军，那简直是飞龙骑脸想输都难，他不动手还等什么？\n杨明华最大的错误，是没看破帝林是紫川参星安插的卧底，还让他统带了关键的远东边军进城，这导致了他最终的失败。\n猪婆娘：“杨明华兵力本身足够，还画蛇添足叫帝林带兵回来干什么？他让中央军直接攻打总长府不就得了？”\n猪：在雷迅统带下，中央军的政治立场是倾向于杨明华一方的，但他们毕竟也是紫川家的军官，要他们主动攻打紫川家的总长府跟禁军厮杀，同时还要背一个弑主的名声，大部分中央军军人是不会愿意的。\n因为中央军和禁军的士兵都是大多出身帝都本地人，大家本乡本土，搞不好沾亲带故的，都是亲戚街坊邻居朋友，干这种造反、沾血又坏名声的事，动员起来是很有难度的。剧情里，紫川秀能稳住中央军不参与叛乱，一个很大的原因就是中央军的军官团本来就有置身事外的强烈意愿。\n但是远东边军就不同了。边军跟帝都老百姓没交情，下得了狠手。在帝都干杀人放火的事他们是毫无压力的。在杨明华的原计划里，帝林带的远东军回来就是当刀子的，而帝都的中央军是用来压阵和事后收拾残局的，两支兵马互相制衡。没料到事与愿违，帝林这把刀子却是捅向了他自己。\n猪婆娘蠢言论：“既然杨明华优势很巨大，他为什么不趁早篡位，要拖那么久？”\n猪：杨明华在帝都城内确实占尽优势，但他一直不敢篡位，主要障碍倒不是总长府里的那万把禁卫军，而是另外两个原因。\n一是元老院。后面的三杰之乱里我们就看到，一个得不到元老会承认和支持的叛逆者，即使能攻下总长府杀了总长，他的处境也会非常艰难的。作为一个老谋深算的政治家，杨明华不能不考虑到后果。\n二是驻守各地的带兵统领，像哥应星、明辉、方劲等人。紫川参星虽然暗弱，但他毕竟还是紫川家明面上的主君，他被弑杀的消息传出去，统领们做出什么反应是难以预估的。所以，杨明华必须要准备好应付他们的暗手以后才能动手。\n也正是因为有着元老院和统领们的支持，紫川参星这个弱势总长才能对上强势的杨明华坚持那么多年。紫川参星和杨明华，他们二人之间有点像洪秀全和杨秀清，洪秀全拥有大势和名分，杨秀清则拥有实力上的优势。二人之间的斗争，谁赢都有可能，胜负也只是一线，不能说哪一方是压倒性优势或者毫无机会的。\n辨了一个中午，最后，杠精猪老婆哑口无言，猪大获全胜，鼻孔朝天。\n总之，对于这一集帝都流血夜，猪是很满意的~~感谢腾讯、铸梦工作室和万维猫动画的兄弟姐妹们，你们出色地复现了原作剧情，表达了猪的想法，让猪当年梦想的世界和故事得以活灵活现地呈现出来，与喜欢的读者们一同分享！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n老猪先生\n点击下载\n3 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价国产动画《紫川》首创隐藏互动剧集？\n《佣兵天下》可不可以做成系列动漫，对此，大家有什么看法？",

          "description": "今天是大年初三，第四集，先给大家拜个年。\n几集播完，引发的一波波舆论有我们想到的、没想到的，千言万语化作一句话“咱老李啥时候有过这热度？”也许是我们一路来收到太多关于老李的负面言论，这么一下子我们都有些不适应。不过还请珍惜雪儿的独角戏。\n另一方面从我个人而言，受邀来此只为了和大家分享，我会很认真的对待，有些评论虽然言语激烈但是说的在理，忠言逆耳再难听也得听着，听完还得寻思寻思，反手再说句谢谢。但对于那些只为发泄的言论，只能表示理解。\n回归正题！先给大家放几张图。\n\n当时我们寻思疗伤这事儿咋样能好玩有看点，又不能太肆意妄为，因为事儿赶着事儿，不能太放纵喽。所以感谢舒导啊，强烈建议美人出浴搞点福利，并带着我反复研究学习女神塞隆著名的某广告，最终成功被删减，不过万幸，没有全部删掉。\n\n这些则是最后一场戏的删减，其实还好，只是删了特写和全景中尸体的数量，无非是最后的冲击力少了些。但难受的是我们“有始有终”的巴也，他的死亡特写删掉替换成破损的单钺，我怕有人误会他跑了，其实没有，他走了，还走得特别不安详doge，他的死状请记住，死的方式很有特点，会是谁的功法呢~\n再说说最后一场戏巴也率人追来，不知道大家觉得压迫感如何，那场戏的气氛灵感来自英剧《浴血黑帮》，几个身着黑衣面容阴郁的挺拔男子，伴随着身后工厂的滚滚蒸汽大步行来，让我备受震撼。\n\n\n\n再有个有意思的就是，姬如雪被巴也一脚跺晕，一开始踩的是肚子，但总感觉从构图到反应都不够冲击力，于是略作调整后，看到这里的同事无不以“卧槽”开头，尤其是磊哥，“卧槽！这TM都踩胸上了！”巴也这脚踩的有多狠，他后面走的就有多刺激。\n最后再跟大家唠唠这一集最精彩的段落，姬如雪的“鸿门宴”。\n不知道有没有小伙伴看过上映前，有一个叫“兖州大殿”的场景PV。那里面都是我们一开始的设想，偌大的破败古庙，两侧监国锦衣持刀而立，行注目礼，压力直给。那是美好的设想，压迫感是来了，但最后要是无双也太没意思（其实就是人多拍不起）。于是我们加入了巴也四徒（四人面具是喜怒哀乐，有看出来的嘛），设计了一场3D立体打姬。\n运镜、动作编排这些就不细说了，好不好观众评判，这次从耳朵出发——音效和音乐。\n首先音效，这场戏是多人混战，同时武器驳杂调度也大，特别适合作为例子来聊。在那个追着我要头发的音效师那里是第一步……\n\n我们需要把细节、比例、大小、方向全部处理好，好的音效就是让你注意不到，同画面永远是一体的，是最真实的表达。但是当离开录音棚，离开拥有高解析和声场的监听级设备，很多东西就会被捏在一起，不是每个人都有好几千的耳机或音响设备去体验的，所以就来到了最后一步，就是我需要带上一个平价的耳机同时使用电脑自带的音响，再处理一遍音效。主要处理声音的重点，尽量保留细节同时把距离感和力度突出来，这种处理方式会有损音效本身的精度，但会让大部分设备都能更直接感受到我们所想表达的内容。放假走的匆匆，没拍照，有机会给大家看看剪辑软件上音轨的调整画面~\n音乐也是同理，甚至更甚，毛大师那边就会用好几种喇叭模拟各种设备的效果，当然架不住坏的啊。记得刚播出那天，模型有个小姑娘看完输出的mov，跑过来慌慌张张告诉我\n“李导李导，OP的声音有问题呀，念白听不清楚啊。”\n我都惊了，急匆匆赶去拿起她的耳机，她告诉我\n“导儿，用左耳，右耳是坏的”\n我好像意识到什么，但还是拿起左耳带上，传出的声音就跟把你裹着被子沉海里一样，左边的解析一样有问题。所以啊，咱们有条件我强烈推荐戴耳机观看，稍稍在意一下自己的体感，求求了~\n接着音乐部分，这一集可真是把我纠结死了，为姬如雪单独写了首《巾帼》，如果看到片尾的小伙伴可能会发现，片尾的曲子与姬如雪独战是一个旋律，它们都是《巾帼》。最终通过版其实是片尾这一首，从姬如雪拄剑站起，拔出匕首，大家可以试试把这个音乐贴上去，递进感更强更燃更合适，但问题是！音乐中的两次高潮，旋律是一样的，从姬如雪撞断柱子“而是，让他带我走！”这里开始，本想所有动效都摘掉，全靠音乐炸起来，结果，结果就是没炸起来……\n\n当时我意识到，这种问题给毛大师淦碎了也没用，周期不等人，所有环节继续，到最终定剪时，我一咬牙，决定取上一版Demo的前半段保留最终版的后半段，在旋律上做些区别，音效也配合垫上一些，尽可能加大前后落差以增强冲击力。我都做好前面直接用Demo的准备了，毛大师知道后，赶在交片前重新录制调整，才有了两首不一样的《巾帼》，感谢毛亮老师，你简直是我们的HERO！\n这些问题都是不到最后感觉不到的，突发状况，最后将进击版《巾帼》放在片尾我觉得还挺酷的，本来这集是要放原点的嘿嘿，再等等，下一集更合适！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n十万个秋刀鱼\n点击下载\n78 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价《画江湖之不良人》第 5 季第 3 集？\n如何评价《画江湖之不良人》第五季？",

          "description": "5 年后，Slackware 发布大变样的 15.0\n\r\nSlackware 是最古老的仍在维护的 Linux 发行版。它的上个版本是 2016 年发布的 14.2。作为一个古老的发行版在五年后发布的 版本，这个版本中有了大幅变化：提供了 5.15.19 LTS 内核；采用 PipeWire 替代了 PulseAudio；X11 之外还提供了 Wayland；用 Qt5 替换了 Qt4；采用 PAM 替代了纯 shadow 密码方式；Postfix 默认替换了 Sendmail；Dovecot 替换了老的 imapd 和 ipop3d；elogind 替换了 ConsoleKit2；带有 Rust 和 Python 3；独有的包管理器 pkgtools 有了很大改进；桌面环境提供了 Xfce 4.16 和最新的 Plasma 5；主要的编译器是 gcc-11.2 和 llvm 13.0；默认浏览器是 Firefox 91.5esr。并且，完全没有 systemd。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：简直是一夜之间告别过去，重新粉饰新家。明天我们或许会详细解读一下。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n一半的英特尔芯片漏洞是员工内部发现的\n\r\n英特尔在其 年度安全报告 中指出，在 2021 年发现的 226 个 CVE 漏洞中，有一半是英特尔员工在内部发现的，其余 113 个 CVE 中，有 86% 是通过他们的 Bug Bounty 计划从外部发现的。77% 的漏洞存在于硬件/固件中，70% 的英特尔软件安全问题是外部研究人员发现的。漏洞最多的产品是他们的图形硬件/驱动程序，其次是以太网产品和其他软件。最后，他们将 CVE 数量与 AMD 进行比较，英特尔在 2021 年称其 CPU 只有 10 个 CVE，而 AMD 共有 31 个；在图形类方面，AMD 在这一年有 27 个 CVE，而英特尔有 51 个。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然这些年英特尔 CPU 出现了许多严重漏洞，但是看起来他们还是相当重视的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMozilla 关闭了其 VR 浏览器 Firefox Reality\n\r\n这个开源浏览器允许用户通过单独的 VR 和 AR 头盔访问网络，用户可以访问标准的 URL，进行搜索，并最终在 2D 网站和沉浸式网络体验之间移动。Mozilla 解释 说，它决定关闭 Firefox Reality 的原因是计划将该技术放到其他社区和组织中，这样它就可以“像 WebAssembly、Rust 和 Servo 一样继续发展并为网络作出贡献。”\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在这个元宇宙大热的时间，Mozilla 却砍掉了其开源的 VR 浏览器，这是对自己的产品能力没有信心吗？",

          "description": "它不是每个人的理想选择，但作为一个 Linux 爱好者，我喜欢用它做实验。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n当 Pine64 在 2019 年发布 PinePhone 时，没有人能够预见它将对移动 Linux、桌面 Linux 和隐私产生巨大的影响。\n\r\n作为 少数专为运行桌面 Linux 而设计的手机 之一，它具有低端安卓手机的所有功能，同时又具有笔记本电脑的多功能性。不幸的是，桌面 Linux 就是这样：它是为台式机设计的，而不是为手机设计的。\n\r\n幸运的是，由于 GNOME、KDE、Pine64 和众多 Linux 社区的惊人力量，全新的桌面环境、应用程序和发行版应运而生。其中一些比较知名的包括 Plasma Mobile、Phosh、Megapixels 和Mobian。\n\r\n有了这些所有关键的部分，Pine64 需要做的就是销售 PinePhone，他们确实也卖出了 PinePhone。每一轮社区版（每个都预装了不同的发行版）的预购都收到了数千份订单，其中之一就是我的。\n\r\n自从我在 2020 年 12 月收到我的设备后，PinePhone 一直是我日常生活中的重要组成部分，我在 2021 年全年都把它作为我的日常设备。以下是我使用它的经验。\n\r\n它的性能就像糖浆一样\n\r\nPinePhone 采用了全志 a64 系统芯片，它的功率只够完成最基本的手机任务。即使是简单的事情，如打开火狐浏览器，也需要将近 20 秒的时间，这无疑要“归功于”它仅有的 4 个核心。这与现代中高端安卓手机形成鲜明对比，所有这些手机都有至少 2GHz 的 8 核处理器。\n\r\n幸运的是，社区再次介入，对数以千计的小型软件实施了优化。虽然性能仍然不如安卓系统的竞争对手，但这确实意味着 PinePhone 对于大多数手机任务来说是非常适用了，甚至在通过附带的底座使用外部显示器时，也可以使用一些面向桌面的应用程序。\n…",

          "description": "《小狗钱钱》—— 一本理财天才童话\n《小狗钱钱》是由德国作家博多·舍费尔所著，一本面向儿童的理财入门书籍。作者将理财观念，通过小狗“钱钱”的童话视角，传递给书中主人公吉娅。帮助吉娅实现了梦想，并且在很小的年纪便获得了理财上的成功。\n但就目前教育的大环境而言，理财并不是应试教育中的必须，所以像我一样的大多数年轻人，成长到二十多岁才逐渐开始意识到理财的重要性。尽管近几年“如何在大学四年存款十万”“如何在大学赚到第一桶金”的帖子和视频火热，但是真正有意识和有能力做到的人，其实寥寥无几。\n因此，尽管这是一本儿童读物，但是对于缺乏正确理财观念的我们大多数人来说，这依然是一本极好的入门秘籍。书中提到了非常多值得实操的方法，比如：把钱分成日常开销、梦想目标和金鹅账户三部分；进行明智的投资；成功日记；梦想储存罐等。（感兴趣的朋友可以仔细阅读哦！）\n成功日记——更系统、更有效的帮助自己建立信心\n舍费尔先生提到，同成功相比，我们更轻易地记住错误和失败，它们在我们大脑中留存的时间是成功的11倍。因此我们在自己心目中的形象总体上会比实际差得很多，而且我们周围的环境和我们所受的教育也宣扬这种消极倾向。\n而一本成功日记可以让自己意识到自己有多优秀，帮助自己建立信心。往往自己的收入与自己自信的程度也息息相关，足够自信才有可能成功并获取更多收入。\n那怎么记录成功日记呢？它其实是一个记录成功事件的日记。可以是自己所获得的每一次夸奖和每一次认可，也可以是自己遵守纪律，完成的一项任务，或者做了什么使某人快乐的事情，都可以记录在成功日记中。记录成功日记目的只有一个：更系统、更有效的帮助自己建立信心。\n以我的成功日记为例，因为刚刚毕业参加工作，其实会有点迷茫，不知道现在的岗位是否合适，也不知道自己未来的方向在哪儿，更不知道自己有哪些能力能匹配什么样的工作。于是我在成功日记中尽可能的记录工作中完成得好的事项，一段时间…",

          "description": "theme: smartblue\n相信大家已经都在对 Flutter 2.10 版本跃跃欲试，本篇就目前升级用 Flutter 2.10 版本遇到的问题做一些总结提炼。\n事实上按照 Flutter 每个版本的投入使用规律，应该是第三个小版本最稳，以 Flutter 目前庞大的用户量，每次正式版的发布必然带来各种奇奇怪怪的问题，一般情况下我推荐 2.10 版本等到 2.10.3 发布再投入生产会更稳妥，但是如果你等不及官方 hotfix ，那么后面的内容可能可以帮助到你。\n本次如果你是从 2.8 升级的到 2.10 ，那么 dart 层需要调整几乎等于零。\nKotlin 版本\n首先就项目升级的第一个，也就是最重要的一个，就是升级你的 kotlin 插件版本，这个是强制的，因为之前的旧版本使用的基本都是 1.3.x 的版本，而这些 Flutter 2.10 强制要求 1.5.31 以上的版本。\nbuildscript {\n-    ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'\n+    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'\n\n这里需要注意，这次升级 Kotlin 版本，会带来一些 Kotlin 包的 API 出现一些 break 的变化 ，所以如果你本身 App 使用了较多 Kotlin 开发，或者插件里使用了一些 Kotlin 的包，就需要注意升级带来的适配成本，例如：\nProducerScope 需要 override 新的 trySend 方法，但是这个方法需要 return 一个 ChannelResult ， ChannelResult 是  @InternalCoroutinesApi 。\nGradle 版本\n因为 Kotlin 版本升级了，所以 AGP 插件必须使用最低 4.0.0 配合 Gradle 6.1.1 的版本，也就是…",
