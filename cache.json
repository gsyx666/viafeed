More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.\nWhen it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge.

          "description": "what should I know before learning Java\n\n\nWell, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)\n\nI am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. \nIf you are a beginner, please don't use any kind of IDE.\n IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. \nIt is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. \nAs using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. \nSo you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. \nThis learning method is slow but very effective. \nAlthough you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. \nYou can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.💯",

It also highlights the line with different colors to help you better visualize and differentiate between errors, warnings and other messages!\n\nWith this extension, you can search for relevant CSS files by using CSS classes in html file and edit CSS files there itself! Here's how it works:\n\nGitLens is a powerful extension which can display when a particular line was committed, by whom it was committed and in which pull request it was included along with the commit message! All of this information is inline with the line upon which your cursor is currently located.\nYou can also hover over the message to get even more information about a particular line of code!\n\n\nThere are many more features in GitLens which you can explore and play around with!\nImport Cost allows us to see the size of the imported package inline in the editor itself!\n\nVersion Lens fetches information about dependency versions and displays it on top of the package!\n\nThese were the 5 VSCode extensions which are powerful, useful and can improve your productivity and workflow!\nSigning off.\nTwitter | GitHub | LinkedIn",

          "description": "5 月 17 日，谷歌推出了一项新计划，该计划向谷歌云用户策划并提供经过安全审查的开源包选项，以保护开源软件供应链。该公司在一篇 博文 中宣布了这项名为 “安心开源软件Assured Open Source Software” 的新服务。在博文中，谷歌云安全和隐私部门产品经理 Andy Chang 强调了保障开源软件的一些问题，并强调了谷歌对开源的承诺。\n\r\n“开发者社区、企业及政府对软件供应链风险的意识越来越强，”Chang 写道，并以去年的 log4j 重大漏洞为例。“谷歌仍是开源代码最大的维护者、贡献者和使用者之一，并深入参与了帮助开源软件生态系统更加安全的工作。”\n\r\n据谷歌称，“安心开源软件”服务将让云客户能够访问谷歌的大量软件审计知识。另据其称，所有通过该服务提供的开源软件包也在公司内部使用，该公司会定期检查和分析其漏洞。\n\r\n谷歌目前正在审核的 550 个重要开源库的清单可以在 GitHub 上找到。虽然这些库都可以独立于谷歌下载，但该计划将呈现通过谷歌云提供的审核版本，防止开发者破坏广泛使用的开放源码库。这项服务现在处于预先体验阶段，将在 2022 年第三季度准备好进行更广泛的消费者测试。\n\r\n谷歌的声明只是广大行业努力加强开源软件供应链的安全的一部分，这份努力得到了拜登政府的支持。今年 1 月，美国国土安全部和美国网络安全与基础设施安全局的代表与美国一些主要 IT 公司的高管会面，研究 log4j 漏洞之后的开源软件安全问题。此后，有关公司在最近的一次峰会上承诺提供超过 3000 万美元的资金，以改善开源软件的安全问题。\n\r\n除了现金，谷歌还在投入工程时间来确保供应链的安全。该公司已宣布发展一个“开源维护小组Open Source Maintenance Crew”，该团队将与库维护人员合作以提高安全性。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/05/google-to-start-distributing-a-collection-of-open-source-software-libraries/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：beamrolling 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "（题图与本文内容无关，切勿对号入座）\n从本月初开始，我和几位朋友一起做了一个小小的写作共学实验。我把它叫做「G·写作共学」。这个共学的长期目的当然是在以 GRE Issue 为代表的高水平写作测试中达到高分的要求。至于短期目标嘛，……应该是「用汉语写一篇合格的英语作文」吧。\n为什么要用汉语写英语作文题？或者说，作为经历过高考、接受过似乎还不错的语文教育的成年人，我们为什么要回到如此基础的写作训练上呢？\n用汉语写英语作文有什么用？\n要回答这个问题，我们可以先追溯一下这类英语写作测试的评分标准。GRE Issue 的评分标准包括下列五项：\n\n清晰且有效地陈述观点\n以恰当的说理和事例支持观点\n文章结构清晰完整、重点突出\n内容流畅、表述精确、句式多样且措辞考究\n使用合乎标准的英语书面语进行写作\n\n另一个性质类似的写作测试是 TOEFL 的独立写作部分。该部分的评分标准由这样四个维度组成：\n\n针对话题和题目要求做出清晰的表述\n结构完整，解释、例证和细节清晰到位\n内容连贯、有序且通顺\n使用合乎标准的书面英语进行写作。\n\n与 TOEFL 独立写作性质和作用相当的雅思大作文（Task 2）的评分维度则是「写作任务回应情况」「连贯与衔接」「词汇丰富程度」「语法多样性及准确性」。\n由此可见，无论是语言能力考试（TOEFL 和雅思），还是逻辑能力测试（GRE），在话题写作这部分考查的能力，至少有一半和「英语」无关，而关联于普适性的「思维」。\n把上述评分标准中所有的「英语」换成「汉语」，就会很容易得到得到「一篇好的汉语文章」的评价标准。如果你能写出或者「想」出这样一篇好的汉语文章，并在此基础上把它按照英语的写作习惯转换（注意，不是「直译」）成英语文章，就是一篇可以拿到高分的英语文章。\n我们在练习这些考试的写作部分时，其实训练了自己的两项能力：\n其一是思维能力，也即，用自己的母语（或者说，作为思考载…",

          "description": "前两篇文章中，我主要介绍了护肤的基本理论架构——护肤金字塔理论，以及金字塔底层关于清洁和保湿的部分，这一讲中，我们来认真讨论金字塔第一层中另一个非常重要的部分：防晒。防晒是你开始抗老的第一步，如果你没有条件进行充分的抗氧化与刺激再生，那么请一定要做好防晒，把风险隔离在皮肤之外。在开讲之前，如果你对前面的内容还不熟悉，也欢迎随时补课：\n第一节链接：护肤是门学问：从逻辑和方法开始说起\n第二节链接：护肤是门学问：我该如何进行清洁和保湿\n养儿不防老，防晒才防老\n这句话你大概已经在各位护肤博主哪里听腻了，但是我还是要在强调一次：防老的第一步就是要防晒。光老化问题是导致皮肤老化的重要元凶，紫外线才是你身边最危险的杀手，所以严格防晒是你开始防老的第一步。\n紫外线的危害\n紫外线中，可以对皮肤造成损伤的部分主要是长波紫外线（UVA）和短波紫外线（UVB）两种光波，它们的波段和波长都不同，对皮肤的损伤表现也有区别。\nUVB是“表面杀手”，波长只能到达皮肤表层，最大的危害就是晒红、晒伤。大多数对紫外线过敏的人，都是对UVB的损伤非常敏感。UVA则负责“深层破坏”，往往能能够穿透到真皮层，带来晒黑、皱纹和色斑等问题。无论哪一种伤害，对皮肤健康来说都是不容小视的。所以防嗮是一个既要治标，又要治本的过程。\nUVA与UVB的损害（图片源自网络）\n防晒的选择\n防晒能力评价标准\n既然需要治标和治本双管齐下，那么在选择防晒产品的时候就需要两方面并重。防晒产品一般也会标榜自己两方面的防护力：PA与SPF。PA是指对UVA的防护力度，以“+”的数量多少来衡量防护能力的强弱；SPF是指对UVB的防护力度，以数值的大小来衡量防护能力的大小。综合两者来看，市面上的防晒产品的防护力可以分成三个不同等级：\n低防护力：SPF<30 PA++ 及以下\n中防护力：SPF=30~50  PA+++\n高防护力：SPF=50 PA++…",

The page for the Retro 35’s crowdfunding campaign is very careful not to mention the name of Apple’s classic computer, but it’s drawn some very obvious inspiration, from the beige color scheme down to the placement of the disk drive. The device is eventually set to retail for $49, with Indiegogo “early bird” pricing starting at $25. \nAs increasing numbers of phone manufacturers have stopped shipping charging bricks with their devices, aftermarket chargers are becoming more popular. Often, these bricks offer additional ports or higher charging speeds compared to their first-party equivalents, but it’s fun to see...\nContinue reading…",

The fashion brand previously collaborated with the virtual world for more short-lived experiences, like the surreal Gucci Garden from last year, and is now releasing a more persistent space called Gucci Town. The space features a central garden that links together various areas, including a space for mini-games, a cafe, and a virtual store where players can, of course, purchase virtual Gucci gear for their Roblox avatar. (The company says the virtual outfits make use of Roblox’s new “layered clothing” tech.)\nGucci says that more than 20 million players visited the garden last year, despite it only being available for two weeks, and it expects the new space to steadily...\nContinue reading…",

One frequent complaint about the Steam Deck is its at-times loud and high-pitched fan whine even while playing lightweight games. Some, including my colleague Sean Hollister, have tried a DIY solution to fix the whine, and iFixit’s replacement Steam Deck fans are already sold out despite being on sale for less than a week. \nWith SteamOS 3.2, though, Valve introduced a new OS-controlled fan curve that’s intended to make things better. “This means that overall it’s smarter, more responsive to what’s happening on and inside Steam Deck, and quieter — especially in low usage situations,” the company said in a...\nContinue reading…",
