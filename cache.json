This project also focuses heavily on flexbox, so if you want to get some practice with that then this is the perfect tutorial!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUBhdvK31A \nIn this first part, I'm showing you how to set up the html, and the styling for the mobile version of the website. In the second part I am going to show you how to make the page fully responsive and look good on desktop.\nI have made a git repository that you can clone to follow along the tutorial (which I recommend)\n\nhttps://github.com/SebCodesTheWeb/disneyclone\nHello! My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.\nI'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch). I started this project to get some practice with css flexbox.\nBy the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself and making tutorials on my \nYouTube-channel .\nIt would be awesome if you would follow along me on my journey and learn with me. You can follow my  blog  and subscribe to my  YouTube channel. And if you liked the YouTube video then it would really make my day if you left a comment or liked this post.\n\nKeep Coding.",

Some people think that @if would be a better name than @when, the reason behind this naming is probably that Sass already uses @if, and it would be annoying to many developers if they had to refactor their Sass logic.\nThe bad news is that it's not supported by any browser at this moment, it's not even listed on caniuse.com.\nWhat do you think about this new proposal?",

          "description": "Sometime in JavaScript we need a function that executes only once and never again. Basically a function that disappears right after its called once. How can we achieve this? for example we could do this:\nconst func1 = function(){\n             console.log('this function will never run again!`)\n                }\n func1();\n\nBut we definitely can call this func1() again if we want. This is NOT what we want to do. We want to execute a function immediately without having to save it somewhere.\nfunction(){\nconsole.log('This function will never run again')\n}\n\nif we run this, we would get an error function statements require a function name an that's because JavaScript expects a function statement, but we simply start a new line of code with the function keyword.\nHere we can still trick JavaScript into thinking that this is just an expression. We do that by simply wrapping all of this into GROUPING OPERATOR().\n(function(){\n   console.log('This is will never run again!')\n});\n\nso we basically transform the previous statement into an expression. But the function didn't execute yet. To execute the function we need to call it like this (adding '()' next to it, like we do with regular function call).\n(function(){\n   console.log('This is will never run again!')\n})();\n\nSo we create a function expression and we immediately call it. which is why this pattern is called Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE).\nThe same would also work for an arrow function this way.\n(() => console.log('This function will never run again!'))();\n\nThis will also never run again.\nso this is not really a feature, of the JavaScript.\nit's more of a pattern, that some developers come up with and it is widely used.\nThis design pattern is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.\nSelf-Executing -> it executes the moment it is created.\nAnonymous -> it has no name and is not stored variable.",

Theme and colors\nhttps://flatuicolors.com/ as it provides best colors and combos that are so perfect when actually implemented. It's easy and free to use :)\n\n3. Images\nhttps://unsplash.com/ although you might already know about it. But something that you might not be knowing is that they also provide users with an API that provide aesthetic images by artists for you to implement in your source code.\n\n4. Fonts. YES! please\nhttps://fonts.google.com/ or https://fontawesome.com/ (font awesome provides icons as well).\n\nHope all this was useful to you and I hope you'll apply these in your projects so they would look even more attractive.\nTry finding the best resources that suits and makes you paragraphs sexier!",

It is an optimization technique which is used quite extensively in the programming world.\nAn important point to remember is that whenever memoization is used, there must be a criteria which would dicate when the cached results are no longer valid and the computation must be done again.\nTo understand the problem this solves, consider the following React component:\nimport { useState, Fragment } from \"react\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  cons…",

          "description": "The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.\nlet us look at an example\n\nlet person = {};\n\nperson.name = \"David\";\nperson.age = 45;\n\nperson.eat = function() {\nconsole.log(`person is eating`);\n}\n\nHere we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.\n\nWhen you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.\nSo the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.\nWhen a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:\nReturns undefined (if you tried to access a property).\nThrows an error (if you tried to call a method).",

However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. \nOur mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in.

Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.\nData science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers.

This year, we’re encouraged to utilize existing GitHub Actions to create workflows solutions other developers can utilize to solve problems with open source. My submission was a workflow to run code linter and formatter on only changed files and run test on only changed workspaces of a monorepo. I used what learned from building an SSG in OSD600 to build this project. After all, I walked away having a deeper understanding of GitHub actions, from exploring many existing actions, to building a useful one and publishing it to GitHub marketplace.\nThe other contributions were for improving website accessibility and responsiveness in Telescope. These fixed some of the minor issues I encountered while using Telescope myself.\nTruncate post titles at 2 lines vs 1\nFluid post titles\nSmaller code block padding on mobile\nSmaller code font-size\nUse <time> for date data.

This weekend, I had some freetime from school & got to work!\nThis library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js & Remix)\nWant a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak & experiment around with values!\nTo download the library, head over to your terminal:\nyarn add custom-pointer-react\n\nNext, import the cursor component into your file & customise it!

Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.\nHorizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples. For example, two regional banks may have very different user groups from their respective regions, a…",

You can also use your package manager to install Node. \nsudo apt install nodejs\nsudo pacman -S nodejs\nI highly recommend installing tmux so you can run your frontend, backend, neovim, and git cli in the same terminal window which makes it way easier to keep your workspace clear.

          "description": "I planned how to contribute to an open source project last week and wrote about it in my previous blog. In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!\nFor the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I've decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college's C language course notes. The issue I'm working on is about \"Standardize frontmatter across all pages\". When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.\nI've done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:\nAdded id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages\nEach property of frontmatter was unified in order\nUnified format of description\nShortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the <meta name=\"description\" content=\"...\"/> inside the <head>tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)\nAdded \"Standardize frontmatter\" to the CONTRIBUTING.md file\nPR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Getting reviews and change requests\n\n\nOne of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo's owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I'm familiar with the course notes, but I wasn't very good at C language.\nThe goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn't change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.",

When used within functions it gives more logic options for the code to use and change based on user behavior. This can also help DRY up code in condensing functions.\nThe NOT ! operator is generally used as a boolean. Logical NOT will have truthy value if the operator it's called on (like !(6 === 3) is false and vice-versa (like !(6 === 6) is considered a false value. Here's a different way of…",

You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. \nWhen you clone a Go project from github, for example, you'll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you're coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. \nYou may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn't have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project's go.mod file. \nFor example:\ngithub.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn't have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc. You would then have github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc // indirect in your project's go.mod file. \nnote: the above is a hypothetical scenario, you won't actually have any indirect dependencies with github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2\ngo.sum includes the checksum for the dependencies to make sure that you're installing the exact same dependency as the author used. \nTo create a new Go project where you can have a go.mod file, you need to set it up on your GOPATH with a name for your project. \nRunning go mod init <module name>\nYou need to run go mod init before you're able to get dependencies for your project with go get",

          "description": "Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.\nA couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. \nThe specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh\n posted this:\nDev.to as a headless CMS\nVisakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read\n#react\n        #javascript\n        #webdev\n        #opensource\n      \nThis was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.\nYou've probably noticed several deprecations lately. It's all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.",

Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.\n\n\nIt facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. \n\n\nEasily switches between Versions of your code.\n\n\nEasily undo changes.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What is GitHub?🤔\n\n\nFirst, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.\nIt provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.\nGit is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.\nGit is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.\nGit is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.\nCan't be any simpler than that!!\nPlease make sure you leave a like 👍/loveheart ❤️ on this one.

I love that you can add attendees and other properties. But the tablet app is painful to use with a stylus. And because it's so structured, I'm less likely to add notes that don't fit in a predefined section.\nSamsung Notes. For daily tasks and reminders. This replaced the Cambridge Quad notebooks I used to buy in bulk. I bought a Samsung tablet, and now I'm stuck. The handwriting recognition is the best of multiple apps I've tried. Unfortunately the people at Samsung make it impossible to access and edit your notes on desktop or the web.\nOneNote. Which I've been trying to use because it's there and easy to save random screenshots to. But the lack of basic editing features and plugins sucks. The forced notebook and page structure is also pretty limiting. I hate clicking around to find notes and the view easily feels cluttered.\nRandom sticky notes. For random thoughts, customer service case numbers, git commands to refer back to, etc.\nI would love to use one app that does everything these 4 apps do:\nOrganize my notes into groups and structures that I can easily search and get back to\nBe workable on tablet. I'm not asking for much here. Just let me take notes. Recognize my handwriting and let me edit on desktop or the web.\nSimple interface that doesn't inhibit random notes or reminders I want to jot down.\nSomeone suggested Obsidian. Never used it before, but would love to get some feedback from those who have. If there's another app that you swear, please let me know!\nPhoto by Polina Tankilevitch from Pexels",

The fact that you can decouple a project into smaller manageable bits is good. However, from experience and a couple of blog posts and videos I've watched, they do introduce a lot of complexities. Just to mention a few would be; giving database access to a microservice poses major security risks if not properly implemented, error handling, and especially if the said microservice is down would essentially make the system fail, connection error, read timeout, resource not found...you have to deal with many error scenarios.\nI'm not completely against them, for example I believe a microservice should do one thing and do it really well. A good example would be sending sms notifications. This wouldn't really need to interact with any database. Just accept a list of phone numbers and send out the messages.\nSo my question is; when are my microservices appropriate and do we really need them as much as folks preach?",

          "description": "Video is one of the best ways for capturing audience attention. Product demonstrations, property tours, tutorials, and keynotes all make great content—provided that they’re readily searchable by your team and visitors alike. Even though tagging and categorization help organize videos and make them easy to find, the labeling process is labor intensive, taking time away from key tasks like creating new videos.\nThe solution? Automation. Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, Cloudinary’s  video-tagging feature automatically detects video content. Video tagging extends image classification to image sequences, capable of detecting types of scenes (cities, mountains, the seaside) and objects (people, cars), and even inferring whether the content is appropriate for public viewing. Additionally…",

With Hooks, we can change state, perform actions when components are mounted and unmounted, and much more.\nWhile all these are beautiful, there is a little caveat (or maybe not) that is a little bit frustrating when working with useEffect hook.\nBefore we look at this issue let's do a quick recap on the useEffect hook.\nThe useEffect hook allows you to perform actions when components mount and unmount.\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // actions performed when component mounts\n\n  return () => {\n    // actions to be performed when component unmounts\n  }\n}, []);\n\nThe callback function of the useEffect function is invoked depending on the second parameter of the useEffect function.\nThe second parameter is an array of dependencies.

These two types of state are not the same, and an organized global state will make that clear.\nWhen these distinctions aren't made, you can run into trouble.

          "description": "Written by Sarah Chima Atuonwu ✏️\nPostgreSQL v14 was recently released with some major improvements. Some of these improvements include enhancements for heavy workload performance, improved support for distributed workload, and security enhancements.\nOne of the most exciting releases is enhanced support for JSON, which will be the focus of this blog post.\nBefore we delve into these improvements, let’s get a good understanding of how JSON has been used in PostgreSQL. This will help us to appreciate the improvements better.\nJSON was first introduced in Postgres with its v9.2 release. While it was a very exciting development, its implementation was not perfect. Postgres basically validated that the JSON to be stored is valid JSON and stored it as a text string.\nA major improvement came with t…",

          "description": "During my time as a developer I've created a lot of \"typed\" code. One particular issue has come up repeatedly and I finally had a moment of clarity.\nWhenever I write something like this ...\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport interface DataModel {\n  config: ConfigType; // ERROR HERE\n  [key: string]: string;\n}\n\n... I get the following error on the commented line above.\nProperty 'config' of type 'ConfigType' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'string'.\nThe issue is that the [key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface.\nI've seen something like the following ...\nexport interface Person {\n  id: number;\n  firstname: string;\n  lastname: string;\n  [key: string]: string | number;\n}\n\n... and this code does not present an error. This is because the[key: string]: string; line gets enforced on all key/value pairs on the interface and they are string or number.\nI came up with two approaches to solving the issue listed below. I think the first is the better approach, but I will list both for consistency.\nThis approach seems much cleaner, creating a new data type that has the fixed and dynamic portions ANDed together.\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport type DataModel = {\n  config: ConfigType;\n} & {\n  [key: string]: string;\n};\n\nThe following code is another resolution.\nexport interface ConfigType {\n  type: string;\n}\n\nexport interface DataModel {\n  config: ConfigType;\n  [key: string]: string | ConfigType;\n}\n\nThis approach has the \"issue\" that a new \"key\" could be used with another ConfigType.\nAs I said, I think the first approach (the Type Approach) is the better of the two.\nIf anyone has another or better pattern, please let me know.",

          "description": "Matrix 首页推荐\nMatrix 是少数派的写作社区，我们主张分享真实的产品体验，有实用价值的经验与思考。我们会不定期挑选 Matrix 最优质的文章，展示来自用户的最真实的体验和观点。\n文章代表作者个人观点，少数派仅对标题和排版略作修改。\n\n背景概述\n每次我想打盹儿的时候，几乎百分百会被媳妇的电话闹醒，但是困的时候老是忘记提前给媳妇打招呼，然后就被一阵巨大的响铃给震醒，导致不愉快。很多时候连勿扰模式也忘记开，还会被其它骚扰电话和钉钉电话闹醒。\n最近研究了一下 iOS 15 推出的专注模式，结合日常生活场景做了这么个快捷指令，顺便把制作方法分享一下。\n功能场景说明：运行后，手动选择计划小憩时长 30 分钟或其它时长，同时设置一个 30 分钟闹钟，发送一段文字内容通过短信和微信的方式通知给媳妇，时间到了自动结束小憩专注模式，顺便响起闹钟。\n\n懒得看文章的可以快速自取 ：我要小睡一会儿\n\n准备内容\n\n快捷指令\n一个女朋友及其手机号码和微信好友\n\n配置过程\n设置专注模式\n所有 app 都不允许通知，所有设备之间共享，就是包括 Mac 电脑以及 Apple Watch 都同步状态。\n\n选项配置，连三分钟内第二个来电都要禁止，因为前些年用手机号注册过法人，日均十个各类骚扰电话，打不通他们大概率还会再打一次，所以必须关闭。\n\n快捷指令取变量做信息\n整体逻辑就是，打开的时候选择想要小憩的时长，然后自动化其它操作。所以，第一部分就是选择时长的指令，这块也能自己改成一个手动输入项目，选择自己想睡的时长。\n\n然后，需要两个在短信通知中发送给媳妇的重要变量——从 X 点睡到 Y 点，即通知超过这个时间之后电话才可以被打通。\n通过「日期」脚本就能获取实时时间，通过「调整日期」就可以把时间修改为结束小憩的时间。通过一个「文本」脚本即可把两个关键变量和信息文案进行整理。\n\n注意在时间变量可以按下图配置一下，这样就可以把冗余的日期信息去除了，短信内容结果呈现就是 xx:xx。\n\n消息发送\n第一个「信息发送」脚本就不多说，第二个「微信发送」在 Mac 端是不支持的，操作方法是在手机端先用 Siri 喊一句：\n\n微信发送「要说的话」给「具体对象名字」。\n\nSiri 这么操作成功一次之后，在快捷指令的脚本建议里面就自动出来了可选项，然后按「信息发送」脚本一样操作即可。\n\n其它自动化\n这部分就用默认的脚本选择专注模式结束时间，以及创建闹钟基础脚本即可。\n\n心得体会及踩坑\nMac 端和 iOS 端的脚本还是存在一些割裂和 bug，例如我在 iOS 上设置了微信发送，在 Mac 端打开了一下工程文件，手机上再打开就会默认变成了企业微信发送消息，企业微信好友没有媳妇微信然后就报错了（那说明也可以用企业微信定时来给真领导发送汇报了）。\n\nMac 端无法直接使用闹钟脚本，搜半天发现压根就不在候选里面，微信和企业微信也是没法直接搜到的。\n\n参考内容\n\n用好 iOS 15 专注模式，我们给你准备了 4 个实用的预设 (qq.com)\n如何利用快捷指令定时自动发微信消息？ - African的回答 - 知乎 https://www.zhihu.com/question/399116502/answer/1313098460\n\n> 下载少数派 客户端 、关注 少数派公众号 ，发现更多实用 App 📱\n> 实用、好用的 正版软件，少数派为你呈现 🚀",

          "description": "互联网迄今有两个阶段：Web 1.0 和 Web 2.0。\n下一个阶段自然就是 Web 3.0（简称 Web3）。本文谈谈我对 Web3 的一些初步理解，它到底是什么。\n\n一、历史回顾\nWeb 1.0 阶段，用户是单纯的内容消费者，内容由网站提供，网站让你看什么，你就看什么，典型例子就是新闻门户网站。\n\nWeb 2.0 阶段，用户是内容的生产者，网站只是一个向用户提供服务的平台，典型的 Web 2.0 平台有维基百科、抖音、微信等等。\n\n二、Web3 的特征\nWeb3 的很多特征还不明确，但是国外很多文章认为，它跟区块链有关。\n\n我一直想不通，这个论断是怎么得到的。最近读到一篇文章，突然想明白了。\nWeb 1.0 是用户读取互联网，Web 2.0 是用户写入互联网，Web3 是用户生活在互联网。\n娱乐、工作、学习、消费、交际，都在网上发生。网站不仅提供服务，还是一个生活空间，人们的一部分生活可以在网上完成。\n在教育网站学习，在会议网站开会，在社交网站交友，在游戏网站玩乐。所有网站共同构成了一个无所不包的网络世界。\n三、虚拟世界\n所有网站的生活功能，如果能够连在一起，让用户无缝地从一个场景进入另一个场景，那就构成了一个虚拟世界。这大概就是最近很热门的元宇宙（metaverse）的样子。\n到了那个阶段，用户不再是访问网站，而是进入虚拟世界，过着虚拟的线上生活。\n四、Web3 是分布式的\n这样的虚拟世界，显然不能被一家或几家巨头垄断，否则我们就会依赖这些巨头，不得不遵守它制定的规则。当你的生活都在虚拟世界里面，某一天巨头突然决定关闭你的账号，你的虚拟人生岂不嘎然而止了！\n这就是很多人提出 Web3 应该是分布式的原因。这有两层含义：\n（1）它不是集中式的，就没有单一的公司可以控制它；\n（2）任何一种服务都有多家提供商，通过分布式协议连起来，用户可以极小的成本，从一个提供商转移到另一个服务商。\n五、区块链的作用\n如果 Web3 确定是分布式的，那么区块链简直就是天然的基础设施。因为区块链是分布式数据库的一种实现，本身就是分布式的，而且信息一旦上链，就无法修改。\n这解决了 Web3 的核心问题：不同网站的数据交换。 不同网站都可以自由读写同一个用户的数据，并且这些数据是可以信赖的，从而保证用户进入另一个网站，就好像进入同一个世界的不同地区。\n一旦 Web3 构建于区块链之上，按照区块链的设计，用户需要有一个数字钱包，它是你在虚拟世界的身份证和银行账户。你的身份、财产、消费，都通过这个数字钱包来标识。网站通过数字钱包的 ID，来识别你是谁。\n另一方面，有了数字钱包以后，银行和金融也就变成虚拟的了，这让虚拟世界更像现实世界了。\n六、数字资产\n区块链允许写入任意数据，那么不可避免的，我们虚拟生活的所有数字记录都可以放在区块链上面。\n如果每一样虚拟物品都有自己的一个编号，把它们记录在区块链，那么就可以确定它们的主人（即关联到数字钱包）。\n\n举例来说，虚拟世界的每一把数字牙刷，都可以在区块链上有一个唯一编号，不会跟别的牙刷混淆，并且通过关联到数字钱包，确定每把牙刷的主人。\n我也不知道，为什么要把牙刷放到区块链上，我只是举一个例子，说明区块链可以做到这一点。\n我们甚至可以交易这把牙刷，把它登记到另一个数字钱包，让它的主人变成其他人。现在很热门的 NFT，就是这么搞的，只不过它在区块链上登记的不是牙刷，而是数字收藏品。\n创业家 Chris Dixon 前不久公开说：\"Web3 就是所有权\"，就是这个意思。\n\n如果所有人、所有物品、所有交易都登记在区块链上，那么基于它的 Web3 的玩法简直是无穷无尽，是现在难以想象的。虚拟世界的可能性，比现实世界多100倍、1000倍。\n目前只是 Web3 的初始阶段，基础设施都还没有建成，玩法还在探索，但是进展很快。这个领域应该会诞生无数的创新和机会，值得密切关注。\n（完）\n文档信息\n版权声明：自由转载-非商用-非衍生-保持署名（创意共享3.0许可证）\n发表日期： 2021年12月 7日",

          "description": "撰文 | 魏水华\n\n头图 | 视觉中国\n\n\n红烧肉，中国餐桌的绝对主角。无论哪位厨子、无论哪种菜系，当与红烧肉狭路相逢的时候，所有的个性、技法、风格、创意，都要为这道国民大菜妥协让路。红亮、酥糯，五味调和、香气绵长，这是中国菜对红烧肉的共同标准，也是中国人对红烧肉的集体记忆。如果说麻婆豆腐、葱烧海参、白切鸡和蟹粉狮子头，分别代表了川、鲁、粤、淮扬的门面味道，是中国食谱里最受瞩目的四根台柱。那么红烧肉，无疑是凌驾其上的，更重要的国菜栋梁。一沽好酒一盅肉，一江明月一江秋。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.1 壹\n红亮的颜色，是红烧肉最诱人的标签，也是无数人为之垂涎的理由。吊诡的是，提供红烧肉颜色的主要成分：焦糖，却是无味的。无论是冰糖炒制的糖色，还是添加了焦糖的老抽酱油，它们的主要成分，是糖类受热碳化之后产生的焦糖酐(C12H18O9) 焦糖烯 (C36H50O25) 焦糖素(C125H188O80)等有机化合物。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n它们几乎不提供人类能吸收利用的有效成分，所以人的味蕾也不易感受到它们的味道——有经验的厨师都知道，熬糖色，有甜味就是火候未到、有苦味就是熬得过头。真正恰到好处的糖色，应该尝不到任何味道。为什么这种无味的天然色素，被添加进平平无奇的炖肉中，却能让人的眼睛主观觉得“好吃”“香”“鲜美”？\n\n\n\n其中原因，可能是人类大脑对美拉德反应带来的棕化物质，与焦糖这两种颜色外表相近的有机化合物产生了误判。众所周知，蛋白质是由多个氨基酸，以固定结构组成的肽链。人类只能吸收分散打碎的氨基酸，无法吸收其他生物的蛋白质：这是很多消化功能不好的人，会对部分高蛋白食物产生异体过敏的本质原因。一部分蟹、虾、蚝、贝，即便极简烹饪，或者生吃，也能感受到其中氨基酸鲜甜味，是因为低等生物的蛋白质结构相对简单，白酒、醋、姜蒜等简单腌料和人类的唾液，就能打碎它们的肽链。\n\n\n\n\n牛、羊、猪作为高等生物哺乳动物…",

          "description": "我们通常以抢断和封盖来作为评价一名球员防守能力的指标，如果一个球员能够做到场均抢断封盖1+1，那么他很可能会是个不错的防守人。\n​赛季至今，除去那些出场数不足的球员，总共有13人能做到抢断封盖1+1。如果把筛选条件收紧，要求至少抢断1.7+封盖1.1，目前就只有一人达标，那就是76人前锋赛布尔。\n精英级别的防守是赛布尔在NBA立足的卖点，而在费城球队无法使用本-西蒙斯的当下，如何让赛布尔发挥能量势必会成为教练组内部讨论的重要议题。\n我们也不妨就着这一话题展开讨论，探讨赛布尔使用上的确定性。\n从2019年季后赛对位伦纳德以后，西蒙斯就确定了自己防守核心的战术地位。那么在西蒙斯缺席的当下，能否利用赛布尔的防守能力，弥补西蒙斯不在带来的影响？\n在给出答案之前，我们或许可以看看赛布尔这赛季在防守端的角色，看看他在防守端都做了些什么事情。\n比如在刚结束的对阵篮网的比赛，赛布尔就被指派了单防杜兰特的任务。赛布尔之所以能被赋予如此重要的防守职能，无非是对他防守能力的信赖，而他的能力也有数据支撑：赛季至今，和赛布尔对位的进攻球员平均命中率只有35.4%。\n\n\n\n你也可以看到，即便是强如杜兰特，对上赛布尔也很少采用拉开一对一的方式，因为赛布尔足够强壮，可以顶住进攻球员的背身；横移速度够快，也不吃晃，想拉开强突不容易，同时有一对长臂和不俗的瞬间爆发力来干扰进攻球员的投篮，想要一对一占到便宜实在很难。\n或许下面这个进攻回合，你可以感受到赛布尔单防的压力：当杜兰特原地干拔投篮，赛布尔顺势举手上前干扰，而他举手干扰的高度是真的可以挡到杜兰特投篮视野的。\n杜兰特投篮被干扰的情景，好像不常见吧？\n\n\n\n杜兰特当然知道防他的小伙子是个强者，所以他也没有非要用一对一这种吃力不讨好的方式展开进攻。\n面对赛布尔的防守，杜兰特更多是采用无球跑动甩开，再接队友的传球攻筐，或者持球利用队友设置的掩护，借此绕开赛布尔的…",

          "description": "电影《雄狮少年》今天终于上映了！从2019年到今天，经过两年多的时间，今天终于要和大家见面了，关于对于这部电影的评价，我想把它交给观众。今天我想跟大家分享一下这部电影一些创作点滴和自己的一些背景。\n根据我们故事的风格和特点，我们整个美术风格是偏写实的，卡通程度没有那么高。镜头里的场景，光影，氛围都在尽量还原真实的岭南村庄。而我们的角色必须融入这个环境，没有违和感，而且用他们演绎一个这么烟火气的故事必须可信。\n狮头我们完全是按照真实狮头来的，没有加入过多设计，因为我们觉得真实狮头的设计就已经非常经典了。而真实的南派狮头是有多种风格的，因此我们在电影里采用了三种不用造型的狮头：“传统狮头”（陈壮成、年轻时的咸鱼强使用的狮头）“新派狮头”（阿娟使用的狮头）和“鹤山狮头”（无极狮队使用的狮头）\n\n\n关于人物\n\n刚开始尝试了很多版本，每个角色大概都有7-8稿吧，有些设计是很成熟的，但总觉得没有画出我们心中那种有烟火气的市井的感觉。\n后来我们找到了光圈，他的设计风格正好和我们的需求完美契合，每个角色几乎都是第一稿就能确定方向。\n最终定版人物形象的原因：小人物的故事、突出小人物的朴素感、结合故事背景是乡村少年、故事中的人物最终也要打破偏见\n\n\n关于场景\n\n因为我们大部分故事是发生在乡下，所以我们跑遍了广州周边各种村落。\n最后我们在顺德找到了两个最符合我们想象的村子：百丈村和北水村，这里有鱼塘，村里的房子就散布在大大小小的鱼塘上，非常漂亮。而且还有一些很有历史的祠堂和老宅子，最重要的是，这里还有很多村民居住，很有生活气息。\n\n有些村子虽然很有历史，但已经变成旅游景点，村民基本已经不在那里生活了，感觉只剩一个壳，没有灵魂了。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n然后我团队就开始一遍遍去这两个村子里采风，搜集各种村民生活的细节，还有了解村里的植被，南方乡村的植被是很有特点的，非常丰富。\n我们要了解这里植被的种类，墙上的青苔是怎样的，缝隙里的小草是怎样的，有哪些常见的树，怎样分布的。\n\n\n\n\n还有这些植物的四季变化，因为我们故事的时间跨度有一年多，我们的采风也持续了一年。\n同时我们还开发了一系列的技术流程去呈现这些内容，为了研究木棉的生长规律，我们特效总监甚至把电脑搬去一棵木棉树下去工作了两天。\n\n最后呈现出来的效果我们都非常满意，观看有些画面时甚至都能闻到村子里的味道。大家都觉得这些付出很值得。\n\n\n关于舞狮\n\n首先是动作的问题，舞狮有很多技巧，专业性很强，要通过肢体动作去表现狮子各种各样的神态，之前我们是完全不了解的。为了弥补这个问题，我们导演组和动画师特意去专业的舞狮队做了培训，然后才开始设计舞狮相关的动作场面。为了打起来更漂亮，我们还融合了一些武术和舞蹈动作，做了适当的夸张。\n然后就是布料和毛发的解算问题，狮子身上的毛发非常多，而且是多层布料解算（舞狮队员身上有衣服，然后外面还要披上狮尾），再加上狮尾复杂的剪裁方式（现代的狮尾结构很复杂，中间还加了橡皮筋增加弹性，在舞狮的时候可以伸缩）是一个非常复杂的系统工程。我们都一一作了仔细的研究和测试，最终在三维软件中模拟出完美的动态。\n最后就是渲染，毛发渲染一向是三维渲染中最耗时的工作之一，一两头狮子还好。但我们的决赛有130多头狮子出现，现场看台上有1800多个观众，再加上公园里围观的1000多名游客，还有大量茂密的植被......想想就是一件很可怕的事情，最初我们都不确定能不能渲染出来，我们做了大量的研究和开发工作才能保证决赛镜头的顺利渲染。\n我们这部电影在条件有限的情况下，大家都憋足了一口气要做最棒的作品，这种感觉太棒了，能和他们一起创作是我的荣幸。\n\n要特别说一句的是我们音乐总监栾慧，他为了这部作品推掉了很多工作，专门从东北老家来到广州在我们楼下宾馆里搭建了一个工作室和我们一起工作了半年多，所以这次我们的音乐和画面契合度非常高，因为我随时都能下楼和他一起讨论关于音乐的想法，而且他随时都能上楼看到我们最新的画面，甚至有很多重要戏份的剪辑都是根据他的音乐，我和他一起做了精确的调整，达到音乐和画面的完美匹配。\n而且我们在制作中经历了疫情封锁，我们公司所在的芳村正好处于疫情中心，一夜之间整个区域停止一切活动，我们只能居家办公，也因此导致了制作的延期，当时的绝望情绪现在还历历在目，还好政府迅速控制住了疫情，而我们也利用这次延期的机会做了一些很重要的修改，让我们的作品更进一步，也算是因祸得福吧。\n   很荣幸这一路遇到了很多志同道合的朋友们，也感谢那些与我们素未谋面的观众们的喜爱和支持。希望更多人也能关注到我们国产原创动画，也希望中国传统文化被更多年轻人追逐。\n\n\n孙海鹏\n点击下载\n1060 个回答，查看全部。\n动画电影《雄狮少年》中有哪些彩蛋？\n《雄狮少年》代表了国产动画电影发展的新思路吗？",

          "description": "想来聊点背后的故事。或许有生之年很难再遇上像2020东京奥运一样的情形了（也别再来了）。\n 备赛四年变五年。记不清是央视采访哪位运动员来着，她说，“那天一早去训练馆，瞅着倒计时牌从100多天跳成了400多天。一下泄了劲儿，特崩溃”。100%的真实回应，不分项目，也无关国籍。\n就我而言，多出来的一年，比前面四年难得多的多。撇开年龄和体能，最大的顾虑是家庭。因为疫情，得全封闭训练。其实我家就住天津，离不远的，两个女儿都还小外加老人，本是最需要我的时候，担子却全落在了妻子身上。\n艳子曾经也是一名举重运动员，所有的纠结和挣扎她最懂。后来，她反倒跑来宽慰我说，“就暂时把你交给国家了。（其他）别担心。”这话，是真扎到我心里了，同时也是继续坚持的最大动力。\n 说回备战，变化很多。先是时隔20年首次级别调整。我那会考虑到岁数大之后你降体重，肯定对各方面有影响。索性打81，上了4公斤。但实际上，我和余导对把增加的体重转换成更稳定的技术这方面，什么经验都没有。\n 东奥最棘手还有个什么呢，是国际举联修改的新积分规则，要求必须在2018年11月-2020年4月的三个比赛区间内完成6站积分赛。相当于每两个月就得打一次高强度比赛。就这段时间，我遭遇了生涯内最艰难的一场比赛。也是给自己逼到绝境的一场。\n 2019年9月的泰国芭提雅积分赛，决定拿不拿得到东奥入场券的关键比赛。抓举我开把是165，有点着急了，往前迈了两步掉了，把腰扭了。一个小关节的错位，当时没感觉太出来。第三把，我和小14岁的队友李大银都抓了171。一切就看挺举了。\n 两项间歇时，身体反应就显出来了。动不了，腰肌一下子缩到一团，弯腰都弯不下去。没办法，只能把挺举第一把从计划的200降到191，想着先保个总成绩吧。杠一扔，痛感爆发，走路都走不了，人被架着下场了。\n当时余导过来劝，要不放弃吧，别把身体搞坏了。怎么说呢，没来及想什么多的，就一条，不想放弃每一把，边趴着敷冰袋边回：“不可能，确实不能（弃）”。完了第二把直接加到了205。因为是最高重量，可以等全部人举完再上，也算是战术给自己换多点休息时间。\n 205，是刷新世界纪录的重量。完全是咬死了牙才撑起来的。杠一扔，人就往一边歪了，勉强没倒地。没多久，大银最后一把举过了206，二刷纪录。当时全场就剩我的第三把，顶了个207。这是一个我从来没有在国际比赛上挑战过的重量，但能不能去东京就此一举了。再怎么疼，也不想留遗憾，必须再试一把，给它拼了！\n\n要说犹没犹豫过腰伤呢，也犹豫，但一上台感觉就来了。也不是纯说胜负欲吧，就是想把最好的一面展现给全世界热爱举重的人看。我是真喜欢台上的感觉。\n 说到胜负欲，对2016年的里约奥运，是有的。五年来继续坚持的理由，有它一份，想再较量一把，还是有那么点不服气吧。\n 说个东奥决赛开场前的小插曲，也是后来少见开把没成的教训。权当给大伙避雷。\n 那会中国举重队已经收了三个级别的冠军，我是有压力的。后台区就一直在调情绪，调着调着感觉要爆棚了，还跑去跟余导提“要不开抓170吧”。没同意，依旧165，完了没带起来（兴奋过头随意了）。下场余导很严肃说要重视，我也跟自己说：“就两把了，不能再乱来了。”静下来一步步想动作，怎么带，怎么展。抓举成绩稳在了170。\n\n 挺举开把实话说有瞬间，闪过了2016年的画面。抬杠那下，还是有点害怕掉了的，咬牙硬顶。197一过，心态就完全放开了。第二把204，从握杠就憋足了气，完事锁定金牌后，是有点小喜悦的，趁着斗志又报了210。翻站的时候调铃没有调好，稍微歪了点，丢了。有点可惜。\n 评价什么的不敢讲，比赛很享受，但过程真的很难很难。最想说的是，这份荣誉不光属于个人，而是实实在在地属于整个中国举重队。\n 我是吕小军，一个像热爱生命一样热爱举重的中国人。\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n吕小军\n点击下载\n182 个回答，查看全部。\n2020 东京奥运举重男子组 73 公斤决赛石智勇夺金，如何评价本场比赛？\n2020 东京奥运会举重女子 87 公斤级决赛汪周雨夺金，如何评价本场比赛?",

          "description": "最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。\n\n与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。\n\n虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。\n\n\n\n游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。\n\n\n\n《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。\n最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。\n说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。\n\n虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n呆罗\n点击下载\n22 个回答，查看全部。\n纸糊的药丸是怎么生产的？\n《纸嫁衣 2 奘铃村》讲的是一个什么样的故事？",

          "description": "一证虽小，意义非凡！！\n自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。\n因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。\n退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： \n一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇\n当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。\n退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。\n\n在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。\n但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。\n\n二、光荣的象征\n 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。\n 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。\n对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。\n三、身份的证明\n 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。\n 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。\n 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。\n四、全国通用\n近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。\n而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。\n不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 \n退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。\n\n而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n三剑客\n点击下载\n8 个回答，查看全部。\n我国军人的战斗意志是不是世界最强的？\n军人不能上传照片吗？",

          "description": "大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。\n非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。\n我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。\n首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。\n\n\n\n其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~\n\n厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。\n\n对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。\n最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nNeena\n点击下载\n49 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》第108集？\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》播放量破百亿？",

          "description": "每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。\n当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。\n总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……\n\n作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。\n从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。\n\n大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。\n锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。\n\n然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。\n早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？\n据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。\n\n其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。\n以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。\n\n在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nKay King\n点击下载",

          "description": "简单谈一谈个人的看法。\n电影里的励志、鸡汤，其本身都不是原罪。重要的是，作品的励志与鸡汤是否真正地站在真实性的基础之上。只有客观而忠实地反映了真实，作品才有了励志与鸡汤的基本说服力。\n《雄狮少年》，不是完全彻底的励志向作品，而它给出的真实反映水平，也是“不完全”的：拥有了对真实表象的呈现，却未能走到表象之下。理想与现实，传统文化与当代社会，精神信仰与物质压力，一系列的冲突，也就此停留在了“足够客观的表象展现”程度上。表象客观全面，已经在同类、国产作品里颇为少有，可称“不错”；而缺乏深度细化，则阻碍了它向更优秀之处的攀登脚步，必须报以一声“遗憾”。\n\n这部作品的第一组镜头，便强化了自身的现实属性。在旁白的介绍里，舞狮是中国传统文化的象征存在，代表着曾经时代的光辉。然而，随着一句“主角却不是他”，就将现实的时代做了切换——一个长镜头跟随着骑车的男主角，扫过了破落的农村街景，以及衣衫褴褛的民众，让当代社会的时态呈现出来。曾经以舞狮为骄傲的传统时光已经不复存在，取而代之的，是在物质压力下被迫的生存之道，经济落后地区的家庭为了赚钱，家长只能背井离乡，去大城市打工，而诞生无数的留守家庭。\n包括此时出现的主角形象，都在强调着现实的因素。他不是动漫主角常有的大眼美男，而是生活里比较普遍的单眼皮少年，其后，这种形象也延伸到了女主角扁塌的鼻梁上。这样的形象，让人物彻底回归了现实感最强的“普通”之中——他没有任何突出的地方，外形都如此平庸，也就不具备所谓的“被选中之子”之类的潜藏天赋。\n而主角随后的遭遇，更是让这个信息有了更明确的落地。心怀舞狮憧憬的他，被称为病猫。而抢走他红包的舞狮队成员，一方面体现着舞狮这样的传统文化于物质化当代的变质，同时也反过来说明了舞狮衰落的原因——忙于赚钱的人们，不再对舞狮这样的东西抱有兴趣，这便让历史悠久的陈家村舞狮队，也丧失了自己本应具有的骄傲，物质功利了起来，以…",

          "description": "我从一个游戏程序员的角度聊聊这个问题吧。\n我们现在主要是用Unity做3D游戏的，不过这种游戏项目从设计到制作完成至少也要一年多的时间。前年的时候，想做一个低成本的小项目，能够快速上线赚钱，补贴一下主力开发的大项目。长短结合，这也是很多游戏公司常见的模式。\n为了缩减开发时间，我们一开始就确定要做一个像素2D美术的Roguelike游戏，也是那段时间非常流行的游戏玩法，可能也是见到元气骑士的成功吧。因为是像素美术，所以我们采用了tilemap的地形铺设方式，角色动画采用序列帧方式，虽然没有使用spine，但同样遇到了题主的困扰，Unity的2D工具真的是太差劲了，完全没做完的状态，都不像3D方面的功能基本可用，而是完全不能用的，举个例子，刷tilemap很多这方面的工具都支持外边框和内部砖块设定好，直接用鼠标拖动铺设，而当时2019版的笔刷工具，刷出来都是错的，并且很要命的是内部瓦片随机，竟然拖动这片生成好的地形，内部砖块会随机乱变，这怎么用？好在这部分工具是开源的，我打开代码一看，估计也就是个应届实习生的程序员水平吧，代码错漏百出，然后我又花了一个晚上读代码，把这个功能修好了。\n翻了一下手机相册，正好找到当时的问题视频，随机地块，拖动的时候会乱变：\n随机地形拖动时会重新随机bug\n还有另外一个我自己改造的刷墙功能：\n可以设置墙的厚度，用笔刷拖动\n这个问题只是冰山一角，类似的问题还有很多，当时像素渲染的pixel perfect功能支持也不是很好，像素游戏会出现抗锯齿效果。举步维艰，导致我们重新审视Unity是否可以用来开发2D游戏，我们最后的结论是，如果10分满分，主观判断，可用性也就是5分吧，不是很推荐。这个项目后来我们又改变成3D和2D结合的模式来制作，来减少Z轴遮挡不好解决的问题。不过最后这个项目放弃了，放弃的原因有很多，制作工具不顺畅，也是其中之一吧。\n展示一下最后改为3D场景制作的画面，也不错，这个立体部分是根据2D图片用程序垂直生成的模型：\n这个项目放弃前的一段录屏\n我做程序员已经有20年的时间了，做游戏程序员也有10多年，虽然遇到各种工具问题，都能够解决，但人毕竟不是机器，如果困难重重，是很影响心情和制作效率的，比如你用了不顺手的动画工具，导致效率大幅下降。我相信你的男朋友也是一样，用了一个非原生的插件，会给整个过程开发引入很多未知的麻烦，毕竟程序员是要负责组装整个游戏的，有任何崩溃和报错都要负责解决，这其中的压力和难度，可能是美术工作者无法理解的。我们很多年前开发的《鲤》那个游戏，也是两个人的作品，刚发售那几天，因为测试不够，低版本的iOS会闪退，当时苹果又在全球推荐，发行商和我的合伙人大圈，都在质问我为什么会闪退，什么时候会修好，苹果审核当时还很慢，最后用了一个星期的时间才把这一个小问题修复，但是也因此收到了很多差评，我的痛苦和压力至今难忘。\n所以小团队组团开发，会遇到很多问题，这些问题没有标准答案，真正能让一个作品诞生，无论这个作品好坏，背后都会有很多棘手的事情，这才是游戏开发最难的地方，我也没有更好的方案能马上解决你们的困境，但希望你们互相信任，好好沟通，总会找到办法，能尽快做出你们心目中的好游戏，祝顺利！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n李喆\n点击下载\n88 个回答，查看全部。\n在使用unity独立开发游戏时，你认为实现最麻烦的是哪个系统？\n用unity开发一款游戏需要学习多少软件？",

          "description": "不知不觉在游戏开发行业已过十年，从刚入行的技术小白，到现在依然什么都不懂的技术搬砖工，见证了一个时代的游戏技术变革。我本人先后做过游戏开发SDK，端游MMO，休闲手游，重度手游，大世界手游，大世界端游等各品类产品，现在是天美F1工作室技术中台引擎程序团队负责人。\n游戏行业发展很快，玩家对游戏的要求越来越高，游戏对技术的要求也越来越高，开发量也越来越大。我现在所在的天美F1工作室正在开发3A级全平台的大世界游戏，这是一件非常具有挑战的事情。\n本人作为游戏引擎程序，深知技术更新之快，需要不断的学习才能接受这个挑战。所幸我们已经提前在多个方向积累了对标国际3A大厂的技术能力，并且还在全球招募了不少具有3A项目研发背景的各方面人才。通过不断的夯实技术基础，我们有能力也有信心接受新的挑战。在我们储备的技术中，PCG的技术是目前大世界游戏必不可少的一种技术，现在做一些简单介绍。\nPCG（Procedural content generation过程化内容生成）技术是最近比较热的提升游戏生产效率的一类技术。它是什么意思呢？\n网络百科给出的答案：过程生成（英语：procedural generation）是计算机科学中一种使计算机自动制造一类数据的算法。在计算机图形学中，它也被称为随机生成，常用于制作材质贴图和三维模型资源，并在电子游戏领域中用于自动制造大量游戏内容。过程化生成有着减小文件体积、扩大内容量、增强游戏随机性等优点。\n我个人的理解：如果在游戏中应用，简单说，过程化内容生成就是利用算法来自动生成游戏内容。原有的游戏内容需要美术和策划花费大量的精力制作，过程化的方式可以大大降低人工成本，除了可以节省一些重复的人工劳动之外，甚至可以自动创作出一些新的设计内容。试想如果有一个程序可以自动生产游戏，那是多么有意思的一件事情，也许那天到来，游戏开发者都下岗了。\n地形是大世界的基础，大世界没…",

          "description": "作为社恐人士，看看我这小眼神就知道我是自愿回答的！\n\n\n因为直到开播前都很兴奋，所以前几天都没怎么睡，思维到现在都还有点乱，就随便闲聊下吧。\n\n\n我们跟腾讯动漫算是合作很久了，他们在我们大火鸟还没什么名气的时候就给了很多机会，加上这次能得到《大王饶命》这个项目，真的很感激也很开心。\n\n\n我还记得当初ASK老师和我第一次说这个项目的时候，我就觉得这是我们团队的荣耀，而且碰巧ASK老师和肘子老师还有我三个都是白羊座,生日还刚好挨着，就觉得这缘分也太巧了。\n\n\n说来有点不好意思，在还没见到本人前，我以为肘子老师是那种特别严肃的老人家，没想到碰面后反而有种一见如故的感觉。于是我就追着他问了很多关于小说创作的事，一番交流下来，我算是深刻地领会到了什么叫头部作者。\n\n\n光是我们这几个小时的聊天就足够让我学到了很多平时压根不可能注意的故事创作细节，而且他最厉害的就是可以在极短的时间里想到一段非常有意思的梗，大王第一话开头的吕树怼糖葫芦师傅就是肘子老师几分钟内蹦出来的创意，真的是让人非常佩服。\n\n\n话说回来，虽说能接到这个项目很让人兴奋，但兴奋劲过头随之而来的就是不安了。因为这部小说的知名度很高，加上肘子老师对我们的期待很高，所以我们必须拿出全部实力去完成它才行。\n\n\n最终在燃尽了全部精力后，作品顺利上线了，从那刻起，我心里的不安也就渐渐消散了，真心希望大家能够喜欢上《大王饶命》的动画版。\n\n\n说起动画版的亮点，这两天被大家热议的OP肯定是一个重头戏。实话实说，其实我并没有刻意去做什么布局之类的、与创作无关的事。我只是给了一群爱玩的朋友一个足够的空间，让大家可以在其中尽情玩耍，玩得开心。\n\n\n我确实没想到会火到这个程度，毕竟我每次做OP/ED的初衷就是让创作者尽情表达自己的创作欲，我相信只有完全释放激情和灵感的作品才是好作品。这也是我为什么特别喜欢跟无念聊创作的事，因为每当我跟他聊起OP时，我能够感受到他眼里是有光的，这是他真心喜欢做的东西，就像他说在制作过程里并没有遇到什么太大的难题，反而更像是水到渠成。\n\n\n至于正片内容，对我来说比较难的是如何让吕树的怼人场景比较贴合我们的现实世界，因为如果过度追求搞笑效果的话，很容易就会变成那种烂大街的搞笑喜剧。然而这部作品的内核并不是搞笑，所以我们最初开始制作的时候就定下了偏写实的方向，只有这样才能让吕树这个角色显得更加立体。在初期讨论时尤其让我最印象深刻的是ASK老师说“麻烦导演你把第一季做的穷一些，要那种从里到外的穷感。”\n\n\n真是让人头大.jpg。\n\n\n一部好剧肯定少不了好细节，我们现在每次要制作新作时，在正式开始前都会去相关地点进行场景、道具的取材，《大王饶命》也不例外，这次为了构建出吕树的房子，我们收集了相当多的资料，所以最后出来的场景美术设定所有人看了都很满意。比较可惜的是我们没能赶上庙会的时间，所以没能体会到原汁原味的庙会氛围，有点可惜。\n\n\n除了吕树的房子外，像是比较重要的学校场景也在精心收集了很多资料后对它进行了高度的还原，尤其是道元班的设计，我是真的苦恼了很久，最终才定下了方案。而且因为疫情的缘故，在取材结束后我们就匆匆回到了广州，在那之后因为各种原因也没能再去一次，所以后面的很多场景就只能参考之前拍的照片，通过回忆和讨论尽可能地还原了。\n\n\n最后，再次感谢腾讯动漫，谢谢肘子老师，给了我们这次参与《大王饶命》动画化项目的机会！\n\n\n\n危天行\n点击下载\n62 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价7doc七创社的新作品《凹凸世界》？\n如何评价《镜双城》正式动画化？",

          "description": "很多年前我在知乎给过一个论述，今天再稍微做一次复读机：\n工业水平决定爆款上限\n受众特质决定爆款呈现\n囿于写这个论述的时候，我对于游戏产业的工业化其实理解是有一定偏差的。所以今天我对这个论述稍微修正一下：\n在创意行业中，工业水准决定表达形态。\n当然还是要说明，我自己并非游戏开发，本职工作现在更接近发行；很多涉及开发本身的事情我的回答会显得班门弄斧，请大家多多指正。\n-\n如何定义工业化？\n我的定义就是在项目上建立高效的自动化系统，拥有成熟的开发技术栈，优化的开发工具，并利用成熟的系统高效地生产游戏内容。\n工业化其实更多是生产方式的区别，重点在于效率的提升，而并非是产出的游戏本身的大区别。——在这个意义上来说，某些大作其实并非工业化生产，或者最多是纺织工人用上了珍妮纺织机，但离真正意义上的工业化生产，还有很多距离。\n回归到问题“如何看待工业化对游戏产业发展的重要意义？“本身，在这个回答中，我想谈三个事情。\n其一，是产能的提升。\n产能其实是两个维度，第一是能做什么，第二是同样的时间能做多少。\n实际上是存在一个反-工业化的叙事的。那就是“小作坊”生产。而大家都在鼓吹工业化生产，或者至少认为工业化生产是一个好东西的时候，我们面临的现状是大多数的游戏开发都以小作坊式生产为主。\n这个倒不是说大家条件艰苦云云，而是说开发模式还是以堆人力，怼资源的模式为主。\n在这种情况下，决定产品上下限的，都是团队整体每一个人的能力。在这种情况下来说，人员的稳定性和能力水平就非常致命。\n同时，团队能力的下限也在非常大的程度上决定了你能做什么样的东西。\n而开发的工业化在一定程度上是能够解决这个问题的，成熟的开发管线可以让内容的生产效率更高，也让内容生产更不依赖于某个/些特定人才。\n这点在于游戏产品质量需求提升明显的今天，是尤其重要的：尽快完成开发工业化的厂商/工作室，一方面能够更快的追随市场的喜好，生产表现力更强的游戏产品；另一方面则显然能够有更大的腾挪空间，对市场的适应性更高。\n其二，是管理模式的改变。\n工业化的生产，势必引领更工业化的管理模式。这点在逻辑上还是很明显的。产能提升其实能够显著避免micro-management。项目管理的重要性也越来越多。\n倒不是说某一种或者某几种项目管理模式就一定行。但以往关键角色一言堂的情况，在更高的产能下，其实会有一定的衰减——因为在高产能的环境下，leverage资源比对项目直接bb要更紧迫。\n囿于我本身并非管理者，所以我对于这点的诠释并不全面。但我能够清楚且欣喜地看到，工业化能够带来的是更先进，也更能发挥每个人能力的管理模式。\n其三，则是成本以及行业场景的远期变化。\n有群友回答说，未来的游戏行业会有明显的两极分化现象。这点我非常同意——但是原因跟工业化的生产方式其实关系不大。更多的原因在于需求的变化：即使是在F2P领域，玩家亦需要表现力更佳的“大”游戏。\n诚然，对于多数厂商来说，将自己舒适区内的开发模式更替为更工业化的开发模式，确实会有段时间的成本上升以及转型的阵痛。但长期来看，工业化的产能是能够在一定程度上降低成本的。\n君不见EA，Ubi等等海外开发商，即使在海外他们的人力成本已经跟国内持平甚至更低了。但单纯从开发能力来看，国内还没有哪家公司敢说他们比海外厂商强的。\n更近一步讲。即使对于个人/独立开发者来说，工业化体系下催生的产品，也会对他们的开发提供便利——君不见，Unity的普及让我们其实前所未有地容易开始做游戏了（当然真不真的去做又是另一回事）。\n这最终导致的是游戏开发的商业电影-艺术电影分化，不肯找到自己真实地位的厂家被大浪淘沙。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n知乎用户（登录查看详情）\n点击下载\n17 个回答，查看全部。\n原神2.0版本稻妻版本，能否说明米哈游原神制作组已经完成团队磨合，进入游戏工业化高产能状态?\n你为什么会觉得做独立游戏和做工业化游戏差不多呢?",

          "description": "感谢邀请。确实，从目前趋势看，国内各大游戏厂商和工作室都陆续在海外布局，在海外设立自研工作室并大力引进海外高端人才。海外工作室的建立，可以一定程度上进行产能扩容，减轻游戏内容的研发压力。\n更重要的是，海外一线专家的加入，可以带来老牌游戏开发商在高品质内容生产上的方案和经验，对于快速完成生产管线改造和核心研发能力升级上有比较大的参考意义。对于国内游戏厂商来说，加入全球化研发无疑是加速团队成长与探索AAA生产模式的机遇。\n但挑战总是与机遇并存，全球化研发的趋势对游戏研发团队和个人，都会带来更多新的要求。不论是国内的游戏工作室，还是海外游戏厂商，目标都是建立“快速量产AAA品质游戏内容”的能力。只是各自的原始积累不一样，努力的方向也不尽相同。\n对于我们来说，想在游戏研发全球化的大趋下守住优势并脱颖而出，不论在技术与工具的积累和探索上，还是在生产模式的摸索和迭代上，都应该以兼容并包的心态，吸收国内外的先进经验，快速建立自己的产研优势。\n我们工作室在技术革新和前沿探索上一直比较积极，我自己也经历过数次大规模的技术升级和管线改造，目前也在负责新项目的技术迭代的规划和落地，可以分享一下我们在这个过程中的想法和经验，希望能提供给大家作个参考。\n准备一：搭建工业化管线 — 流程标准化与生产自动化\n随着玩家对高品质游戏内容量的需求增长，未来精品游戏项目的研发必然需要超大规模团队的承载和支撑，也呈现着跨地区多团队配合的趋势。这也正是全球化研发的本质。\n跟单一团队生产不一样，跨地区多团队的联合研发，对于生产流程标准化的要求会非常高，以避免低效沟通带来生产成本的极大代价。\n海外厂商在多地团队联合研发上有其经验和优势，值得我们借鉴和学习。 同时在游戏内容生产方面，自动化生成代替纯人工生产也将成为大趋势，通过程序化的方式可以大幅减少在内容生产上的人力成本，并提高整个项目的研发效率，以适应市场的快速变化。…",

          "description": "我是在传统老牌的西方 AAA 公司工作 15 年后加入中国游戏研发工作室的，我结合自己的观察和体验，尝试回答这个问题。\n近几年，中国的游戏公司有很大的变化，逐渐向重视原创、追求更高品质、打造具有中国文化特色的游戏产品转变。最近经常听到这样一句话“中国游戏玩家的口味越来越高，国内的游戏公司也开始卷起来了。”\n“卷”这个词用在这样的语境下，我认为不是件坏事，它代表着随着市场需求的变化，中国的游戏厂商对于品质的重视程度变得越来越高。\n国外的 AAA 厂商已经这样“卷”了十几年了：游戏的画面越来越接近影视化，内容丰富度和体量越来越高，争相进行技术上的探索和突破，同时创新的作品也层出不穷。我很高兴看到中国的游戏公司也以这样的方式“卷”起来，让中国的游戏产品在各个维度上与国外的 AAA 大作掰一掰手腕。\n\n我相信这样的转变，对于许多海内外从事 AAA 游戏开发的人才选择加入中国游戏公司，是一个至关重要的前提。 \nAAA 游戏的开发是一个先慢后快的过程。一个非常有经验的 AAA 游戏团队，也可能要花费 1-2 年的时间来完成概念和创意方面的探索，2-3 年左右的时间进行试生产（Pre-production），这里主要包括设计方面的验证和技术管线的搭建。\n所以，经常会出现游戏开发了 4、5 年，看起来却只有一个垂直切片以及一大堆白盒和临时资源的情况。但接下来会是神奇的一段时间，通常 80% 的游戏内容，都是在最后的 1 年到 1 年半时间里完成的。\n这种“神奇”有一个前提条件，就是整个团队可以沉下心来，完成前面提到的创意设计和试生产环节，否则最后的全面投产（Full-production）将会是一场灾难。\n每一部 AAA 游戏的开发都是一趟漫长的旅程，耐心，信心和决心三样缺一不可。而我已经在国内的游戏厂商中看到了这三样东西，所以我回来了。\n从 EA 到天美\n我在 2006 年加入 EA 上…",

          "description": "其实把“野外露营”和“精致露营”作为对比选项，就像把“西餐”和“水果”拿来对比一样，在概念的内涵和外延上，怎么说都有点“差辈”。\n\n\n基本上，露营可以分为三种：\n\n\n第一种，Bushcraft露营，更倾向于荒野求生。\nBush是澳大利亚对森林的称呼，Craft则是技能的意思。所以Bushcraft也就是那种住山洞，或者拿树枝搭个窝棚，最不济带一块油布搭个避难所的露营。\n\n这是回归原始生活的一种露营，什么现代化工具都没有，什么钻木取火了，什么用树皮做绳索了，什么拿木头挖陷坑了，玩就玩最野的，没有足够的知识、经验、体魄、意志，是做不到的：\n赤身裸体户外露营，夜晚如何取暖御寒_哔哩哔哩_bilibili\n\n当然，在国内，怎么钻木取火荒野求生，那都是动嘴的，实际上绝大部分Bushcraft爱好者连公园都没睡过，真动手的都是买买买，什么2000块钱的英国手工斧子，什么1500块钱的美国煤油灯，什么3000块钱的瑞典柴火炉。没钱的就买什么战术鱼钩、钛合金火柴盒啥的，逐渐沦为COSPLAY艺术、手工艺品收藏，和YY了。\n\n这其实不是Bushcraft露营，而是Bushcraft风格露营，也就是牛奶和牛奶风味饮料的区别了。\n\n\n另外从环保的角度说，古人这么露营是没办法，从现代露营的角度来说，明明是从大都市开着越野车进林子，明明有20块钱、200多克一个，一个能用两天的气罐不带，非要带好几斤重的斧子去乱砍树木，破坏环境，就为了烧起一堆柴火感觉很炫酷，我个人是对此相当持保留意见的。\n\n\n\n无痕山林的准则，不说全都对，但既然你要去露营，最好还是要了解一下：\n1.事前充分的规划与准备，\n2.在可承受地点行走宿营，\n3.适当处理垃圾维护环境，\n4.保持环境原有的风貌，\n5.减低用火对环境的冲击，\n6.尊重野生动植物，\n7.考虑其他的使用者。\n\n\n\n\n\n第二种，经典露营/常规露营。\n也就是最为我们熟知…",

          "description": "『车田漫画里需要的不是起承转合，如何让读者感到惊讶才是最重要的』\n———by 车田正美\n\n\n\n这是整个车田宇宙的核心，也是圣斗士成为经典的核心。\n\n\n也许当年就真吃这套，天马行空的设定比故事本身更受关注。车田这么做了，也确确实实的做到了，打造了一个跨世纪的经典。\n\n\n车田以他自己那套独创的模式开拓了一片新天地。「开头→叙述→转折→结尾」这种死板的形式，在车田宇宙里可不太常见。\n\n\n各种荒诞无稽的设定，夸张的必杀，独特的战斗表现集合成所谓的『车田節』。凭借这些独特之处，堆砌了圣斗士世界。\n\n\n\n▽\n当然，光有核没有精美外壳想必也无法做到风靡世界。其中，星座的实体化无疑是圣斗士成为经典的最重要因素。\n\n\n在生活中，星座早已成为如同十二生肖般的必然存在。当时，多少朋友通过圣斗士把十二星座倒背如流。\n\n\n星座通过防具【圣衣】得到实体化。再配上美型男与其搭配，这是男女通杀的妙招，无一幸免。\n\n\n圣衣的定位本身也是一个亮点，它增大了星座实体化的魅力！\n\n\n\n『最初打算用日本武士铠甲型防具，战斗模式就像空手道对决那样。威力过于强大，所以需要穿戴防具。\n\n\n但感觉普通的防具太土。烦恼之际，脑中突然浮现出希腊神话，觉得把防具做成星座的形状那绝对很酷。\n\n\n防具定位于西洋风那种带曲线的设计。现在看来狮子座艾欧里亚的黄金圣衣，应该是最接近当初所构思的印象吧』\n\n\n\n圣衣效仿西洋风甲胄，但未照搬样式。反倒是削弱了笨重感，进行了更贴身的改良，就像穿戴的服装一样。\n\n\n动画版中的圣衣设计，更是改良得凸显了美型男的完美身体曲线。这样的视觉冲击，也是促进人气暴涨的重要因素吧。\n其中，荒木伸吾与姫野美智的功劳甚大\n\n\n圣衣根据等级还体现着不同的风格。而这种等级差异，车田直接用对身体的覆盖率，进行了体现。\n\n\n\n『当初对圣斗士有个大概的年龄设定。青铜为初中，白银为高中，黄金为大学。对应身高约在165，175，180左右。\n\n\n另外，圣衣的等级如同军队里的官阶。青铜为尉级，白银为校级，黄金则是将级。\n\n\n一般印象中，低等兵大都穿戴像作业服那种比较短款的服装，长官级是夹克之类的，而将领级则是长款大衣那种吧。\n\n\n如此，仅凭穿着就可能判断出级别。当时就是这样考虑的』\n\n\n圣斗士中青铜最低级，看着也最凉快。白银稍微严实点，黄金则露出更少，神圣衣基本就约等于全身覆盖了。\n\n\n\n虽然是防具，但圣衣更像是一种时尚。圣衣的命名『cloth』也算是回应了此特征。\n\n\n似衣非衣，即使不穿戴圣衣，它依靠着星座本来的造型依然能独立炫酷的存在。这样的设计超级有魅力，即便现在也依旧拉风。\n\n\n▽\n如此独特的设定，没有足够大的空间，想必也难以展现出它全部的魅力。\n\n\n圣斗士宏大的世界观，就为圣衣提供了一个完现魅力的『时尚平台』。圣衣在无形中仿佛拉近了传说与现实的距离。\n\n\n\n车田用一个『超』字把众多神话串联起，所有神话被归纳成同宗。各家神话在圣斗士世界里就相当于从宗家衍生出的支派。\n\n\n但在未普及互联网，信息较闭塞的当时也很难能了解到这部分内容。\n\n\n而圣斗士的历史背景，其尺度远比当时所理解的要大得多得多，被称之为『大圣战史』。\n\n\n》宇宙的诞生\n》生命的诞生\n》雅典娜的诞生\n》波塞冬的初次圣战，圣斗士与圣衣诞生\n》巨人族之战\n》阿瑞斯的圣战\n》and so on………\n\n\n在正篇开始之前，还有这么一大段迷一般的历史存在。这一切在作品中基本都未提及，而是记载于此刊物中。\n\n\n\n当了解到这一大段历史后，有种圣斗士的尺度又被放大了一倍的感觉。就是在这样一个大世界里，光芒万丈的圣衣照亮着每个角落。\n《圣斗士星矢》中的众神体系是怎么样的？\n\n▽\n比起圣斗士的世界观，它的故事则显得要简单得多。但依靠这来自独特灵感的设计，依旧让此作如凤凰烈火般火红。\n\n\n因为车田一直致力于让观众感受到震撼！\n\n\n他破天荒的才能，对当时的观众来说也许是恰到好处。仿佛是艾欧洛斯附身，用暗影之箭束缚了世界各地观众的心。\n\n\n时代在变，那份情怀却难以忘怀。那句口号依旧响彻云霄，被喊出了跨世纪的经典：\n\n\n燃えろ、俺のコスモよ！\n\n\n\n\n^参考\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n千翻儿娃\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n《圣斗士星矢》的顺序是怎样的？\n如何评价《圣斗士星矢》中五小强之一的瞬？",

          "description": "答案是肯定的，平台确实决定了驾驶品质。\n首先，什么是汽车平台？有人把平台理解成搭积木的框架，或者造房子的地基，这没错，但也比较片面。平台化还代表着一整套造车理念、标准和体系，贯穿了整车设计、生产工艺、制造流程、以及质量管控的整个流程。\n再一个，驾驶品质是什么？可以简单理解为一款车开起来是否好开和“过瘾”，坐起来是否舒服、是否“上档次”。其中包括汽车的动力、转向、底盘及整个的操控性能，还有滤震、隔音及行驶的质感等等。也许不能完全判定，驾驶品质好就等于好车（因为产品定位重点可能不一样），但驾驶品质不好的车肯定不能认为是好车。\n其实平台最大的意义在于标准化、模块化生产，从而降低车企研发制造成本，某种程度来说，平台就代表了就像一个人的原始基因，而且平台的优势必定也会“遗传”给车型。\n比如，大厂的平台比小厂的（或许就是搬用的大厂老平台）、新的平台比老一代的，理论上都会更加高级。越高级的平台，越能承载更多的先进技术和科技，在车身安全性架构、轻量化设计、底盘规格、NVH等方面也会更好，造出来的车相应也会更好。\n\n例如，理论上，前驱平台的车往往都是紧凑型级别，顶多达到中级。后驱平台的则往往是中型车，中大型车，而且多为发动机纵置布局，在动力传导、操控性能方面会更有优势。同时，相应的造车成本，用料做工、安全、行驶品质调校也会更好。\n举几个简单的例子，目前有一些自主品牌的低端型“SUV”，实际上来自“微面”的平台，属于“板车悬架”，舒适性自然难以和常规城市SUV相比。再比如上汽大众途昂，尽管看上去这么大的块头，但却来自于主要生产紧凑型车的MQB平台，网友吐槽的“拉皮”也非空穴来风。又或者说，已经退市的一汽丰田皇冠，和现在中国市场代替它的亚洲龙，虽然皇冠来自更老的平台，却是中大型车的后驱平台，在先天基因上就比前驱的亚洲龙更加高级……\n说到丰田，大家想必知道丰田的TNGA架构，几乎时下丰田和雷克萨斯一半的车型都来自于此平台。比起上一代产品序列，TNGA架构打造车型在车身刚性、操控重心方面有着明显进步。因此也可以说，这一代新平台的丰田，比以往同级别前辈车型操控更好。\n\n普遍来看，新的造车平台，融入了更先进的造车理念，整体的车身框架更加合理，被动安全性也更好。此外，延展性、兼容性也更好，能搭载更新的设计和科技、有更先进的安全系统等等。例如，当下流行的智能科技装备所需要的大量电器设备、线束的布局，在平台设计之初就应该有充分考虑和准备。\n当然，这些都是理论上的，虽说凡事没有绝对，但也可以推导出大致的情况。因此，购车选车时，了解清楚其背后的平台会让我们对这款车的大致定位有个基本认识。   \n那么问题又来了，如果都出自于同一平台，是不是大家都差不多呢？例如，MQB平台下的高尔夫、奥迪A3、斯柯达明锐，它们其实没有太大的区别，就是牌子不同？又或者是TNGA架构下的卡罗拉和凯美瑞，是不是开起来、坐起来都一样呢？\n\n答案是否定的。平台只能决定汽车的“基本盘”，但具体的用料、做工以及许多细节方面都有不同。更何况，大众MQB、丰田TNGA等代表性造车平台（TNGA更准确的称呼是架构）有着更大的兼容拓展性，所造出来的紧凑型车和中型车肯定有着巨大品质区别。不同品牌同一平台同一级别车型，如大众、斯柯达对比奥迪、丰田对比雷克萨斯的兄弟车型，同样有着巨大区别，这就像简装、平装和精装的区别。此外根据不同车型的定位，同平台的不同车型也会有“味道”上的较大差别 。\n\n如何在同一平台上更好打造不同定位的车型，如何在概念阶段实现无样车情况下的性能预测与优化，如何处理同平台车型中各种车型的结构共用性、不同性能之间的兼容性、性能与重量成本之间的平衡等，也是我们车身平台化性能开发中致力于解决的问题。目前我们已经可以通过SFE技术、虚拟试验场应用技术、多学科优化技术等手段，在设计阶段快速建立不同车型的车身结构，实现平台车型的性能评估和定义，节约研发成本的同时又高效率进行平台性能优化，在测试验证阶段通过多轮次的调校匹配赋予平台车型不同风格的驾驶品质，满足消费者的需求。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n中国汽研指数专家\n点击下载\n14 个回答，查看全部。\n请问，哪个品牌的汽车，方向盘助力做的较好，能不能比较一下？（方向盘比较轻柔，不用费太大力气。）？\n为什么大部分汽车的方向盘不在中间？",

          "description": "汽车安全座椅在小朋友的眼中，也许是这样的：\n\n其实在1940年前后，一小部分有车家庭就开始使用了。但如果我跟你说，当时的画风是这样的，你还敢坐嘛？\n\n是的，那个时候它的长相和功能和现在相距甚远。严格来说还称不上是一个“安全座椅”，最多算是“汽车座椅”。\n\n如果回到那个时代生活，我宁愿孩子们都不要坐它！因为那个时候的汽车座椅并非现在的「免死金牌」，而是一个不折不扣、骇人听闻的「儿童杀手」。\n下面我就用多图来带大家看看，儿童汽车安全座椅有着怎样令人深感震撼的的百年曲折发展史。\n❤️ 阶段一：座椅？打包带！\n1. 啼笑皆非的早期原型\n上世纪30年代能开上车的，那可真不是一般人，人们普遍认为，巨大坚硬、风雨无阻的汽车本身就是最厉害的。\n当时的克莱斯勒汽车广告上俨然写着： \n “亲爱的爸爸，你看我在100公里每小时（60迈/小时）的车上还能写字哎。” \n“是的儿子，我们现在乘坐的就是无坚不摧的钢铁大桥号。”\n而且无论大人小孩，一律没有安全保护措施。\n\n这在今天就是典型的反面教材，但那时候人们的交通安全意识基本为零。当时的汽车就算有任何安全设施，也完全不是从乘客的健全和舒适角度出发，而是为了驾驶者的方便。\n比如，Bunny Bear公司在1933年发明的第一台儿童汽车座椅，只需要用绑绳捆在座位上。娃坐的高了、看得远了，注意力被转移了。大人开车也就不容易被打扰了。\n\n到了40-60年代，家长可以花1-5刀买一个更加便携轻便的可折叠座椅。\n它通常是像下面这样，用铁架子加帆布、麻布、塑料板或木箱做成的。靠两个铁钩子挂在座位靠背上，酷似一个“带钩子的内裤”。\n\n单看乘坐的部分有点像如今的跳跳椅。不过从结构上更像一个吹风机挂篮的放大版。随意程度简直令人怀疑历史。\n\n还有的人为了进一步增加娱乐效果，让孩子站在车座上模仿大人开车。\n我们大概不需要通过撞击模拟实验也可以猜出，当意外发生时，这种挂钩座椅…",

Since then the site grew to be one of the premier programming help sites on the internet in the mid-2000's being the #1 site on google for dozens of \"[Language] Help\" and \"Programming Help\" searches with millions of visitors a month.

Over the years, other sites have grown and changes in search rankings have seen traffic decline which also means advertising...\n\r\n\r\n( THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE POST.

This mission is scheduled to lift off at 7:20 a.m. EST (12:20 UTC), Dec. 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.\n\nWith revolutionary technology, Webb will observe a part of space and time never seen before, providing a wealth of amazing views into an era when the very first stars and galaxies formed––over 13.5 billion years ago.\n\nIt can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and study the atmospheres of distant worlds. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more! It’s the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built.\n\nWebb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make Webb a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries!\n \nReady to #UnfoldTheUniverse? The greatest origin story of all unfurls soon. Learn more at https://nasa.gov/jwst",

The song was played as part of the Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, a carol service that reflected upon the difficult past 18 months for people across our nation, and particularly for those who might be more vulnerable, isolated or have limited access to support.\n\n#TogetherAtChristmas was a moment to recognise those who have struggled during the pandemic, as well as to celebrate the individuals and organisations who carried out inspirational acts of kindness and incredible feats to help those in need in our communities. \n\nWith thanks to Tom Walker: https://www.youtube.com/c/iamtomwalker\n\nWatch more:\nMental Health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEarly Years: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEngagements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBeZm...\n\nFollow us on our other channels:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dukeandduchessofcambridge\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal",

I've built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob's house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I've never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “Fortnite Chapter 3!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal).

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",

Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok \"For You Page\"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?\n\nThanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!\nYou can check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/kayleymelissa\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: hhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nMadi Price\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",
