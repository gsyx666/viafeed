Software should not be forward-facing.\nExample: Release #1 deploys software with a v1 dependency, and release #2 now uses a v2 version of the dependency. This change is non-idempotent - we wipe out a variable value by storing only the latest state. \nWhat happens to the deployed state that works with a v1 dependency? Does it break or work with the new release?\nThought: Always support X states of existing data. Streamline rollbacks.\nAs more folks campaign for infrastructure as code, we move towards automating infrastructure deployments.\nBut does a change in automation break existing infrastructure?\nThought: Can backward compatibility testing solve this problem?\nAssuming the network behaves the same irrespective of time and region is a recipe for software failure.\nThought: Can Edge Testing gauge pre-release software inconsistencies?\nWith the microservices architecture, a change in one service can cause a failure in unrelated user functionality. Testing a new release in a silo for a fixed subset of features doesn't help.\nThought: Replay tests for all critical user workflows for every release to generate an accurate failures heatmap.\nLet me know if you've solved any of these mistakes and how.\nUntil later! :)",

          "description": "Test-driven development (TDD) and test automation are great ways to reduce bugs arising from subsequent changes.\nIt's widespread to run tests inside the continuous integration (CI) pipeline. It takes away a ton of precious developer time from the repetitive testing tasks.\nA fantastic option we have to build CI pipelines is GitHub Actions. Using GitHub as the code repository, you can set triggers and run tasks in a workflow. These tasks automatically start whenever you push changes to the repository.\nDespite solving a complex problem, GitHub Actions are surprisingly straightforward to configure. In this short article, I've discussed,\nTry it out, and let me know what your thoughts are. How can we make it better? What alternatives do we have? What are your practices in testing software before release?\nHow to Run Python Tests on Every Commit Using GitHub Actions?\nIf you enjoyed reading this post, please share it in your network.

The tool also offers some other useful features: \nColors can be extracted from an existing CSS code (the one used by the website) or from any other CSS code. \n\n\nColors can be sorted and regrouped from a list of Hexadecimal codes.\n\n\nColors can be saved in sets: you can therefore create multiple lists of colors so that you can easily manage them. \n\n\nYou have complete control of the pallet, where you can remove one color or a group of colors. \n\n\n\nI hope you like the tool. I’d be happy to answer any questions, and I welcome your feedback.",

This is similar to the B combinator but changed to work on binary functions.\nThe quintessential usage is when sorting records:\n// given a compare function\nconst localeCompare = (item1: string, item2: string): number =>\n  item1.localeCompare(item2);\n\n// and some accessor function that drills into a data structure\nconst getName = (person) => person.name;\n\n// compose that accessor with the compare function to drill both sides\nconst compareNames = psi(getName)(localeCompare);\n\n// which can be passed to a sort method for an array of that structure\npeople.sort(compareNames)\n\nInterestingly, this is equivalent to doing a map and then sort, but using psi is theoretically more memory efficient:\n// generates an extra array\npeople.map(getName).sort(localeCompare)\n\nLook out for other opportunities to use psi and I'm sure you'll find them. Particularly if you're doing data aggregation or processing. \nPedantic Disclaimer: Psi is usually defined with the binary function as the first argument but I preferred the similarity  to B combinator when taking the mapping function as the first.",

So let's formalize that:\ntype Reducer<T, A> = (state: T, action: A) => T;\n\nThe controller should take that reducer, along with some initial state, and pin them to the class instance.\nexport class ReducerController<T = unknown, A = unknown> implements ReactiveController {\n  public state: T;\n\n  constructor(\n    private host: ReactiveControllerHost,\n    public reducer: Reducer<T, A>,\n    public initialState: T,\n  ) {\n    this.host.addController(this);\n    this.state = initialState;\n  }\n\n  hostUpdate?():void\n}\n\nBelieve it or not we're pretty much done.

When i open my PC it begins to track, really useful.\nThis was the year i began to use linux.

I remember that I just completed 2 but because it was 2 hours or less, so no big deal.\nAs you may know, some Udemy Courses can get through 30 hours of content, and this makes it hard to finish.

That’s why purple is associated with royalty in many western cultures; purple dyes used to be quite expensive, so wearing purple clothes was a real flex! Similarly, early computers were limited to green text on a black background because the monochrome monitors used phosphor, and green phosphor was the brightest and had the longest afterglow (which helped disguise the low refresh rates).

CSS variables were introduced in 2016 with the release of Chrome 49, and are now supported across all modern web browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer.\nIt will make writing and maintaining your CSS easier.

We mostly come across this situation when a React component needs to return multiple elements.\nThe traditional approach has been to wrap them in a div element because a React component can return only one element. This behavior results in useless additional markup and also makes the DOM tree heavy with additional layers of divs.\nThe traditional solution to render 3 child components in a single component would have been:\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n…",

This collection of email-based challenges including (\"Start Coding\", \"Code More\", \"Write More\", and \"Get a Job\") existed long before DEV and CodeNewbie joined forces, but together, we updated it and added in additional support options and a central hub on CodeNewbie Community. Those who participated benefitted from structure, public accountability, inspiration, and ample learning opportunities to reach their goals.\nCodeNewbie Challenge for 2022 (#CNC2022).\n\n\n\n#CNC2022 returns on January 31st. This time, we're making a few changes, including:\nA pre-registration, cohort-based model that allows you to stay in tighter communication with others participating in your chosen challenge\nUpdated resources\nA brand new \"Learn in Public\" challenge that will give you the guidance you need to turn your technical learning journey into a tool for others\nIf you want to make a change in your career or coding journey, we highly encourage you to sign up for Cohort 1 of #CNC2022. \nLearn more, pick your challenge, and sign up for Cohort 1 here by January 30th. The challenge officially kicks off on January 31st, 2022. \nCheers to starting to code, coding more, writing more, getting a job, and learning in public with the CodeNewbie Challenge in 2022 ⭐️",

This is probably the most common way of creating an Array.\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\n\nUsing the ES6 notation you can create a copy of another array. Specially useful in functional programming to avoid side effects (i.e. modifying the original array).\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nconst copyOfNumbers = [...numbers];\n\n// You can also join 2 arrays into one:\nconst numbersTwice = [...numbers, ...numbers];\n// This will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]\n\nJavaScript defines an Array constructor that allows you to specify the length of the array. This method is useful if you know how large your array is going to be. Note that the constructor will create an array where all the elements are empty (not undefined).\nconst emptyArray = new Array(5);\n\nconsole.log(emptyArray);\n// [ <5 empty items> ]\n\nconsole.log(emptyArray.length);\n// 5\n\nThis method accepts an iterator (which can be another array or a set) and creates a new array with the same elements.\nconst copiedArray = Array.from([1, 2, 3]);\n\nThis method accepts an unlimited number of parameters that will be used as elements of the new constructed array.\nconst paramsArray = Array.of('a', 'b', 'c');",

(I guess that's the great part of always working in other project teams).\nLet me describe today in more detail 🤓\nDaily Scrum Meeting\nI had been assigned a mentor 🥰 with whom I set up my laptop. By the way, this is an additional laptop, there is an extra laptop for each project for security reasons. I was given all the access to the tools they use, Microsoft Teams, GitLab, etc.\nJira\nJira, an agile management tool, with Scrum board (there are also other boards like Kanban). There all current issues are entered in the Scrum Backlog, active ones were assigned to a Dev, in the Product Backlog you can find the whole list of all issues. Jira is a very clear and good tool to work effectively as a Scrum team.\nAs you can see, Scrum is very present, so I recommend you to get familiar with the framework before your first job. It will definitely come across well in the interview if you have already dealt with it. \nJenkins\nCMD Shortcuts\nGitLens\nNVM\nnvm use 16.13.1.\nToday was great. 🥳 I learned so many new things without writing a single line of code. I'm really looking forward to finally getting started with my issue. \n\nThanks for your reading and time. I really appreciate it!",

I’m using shallow cloning to speed up things since the entire commit history is not needed.\n# grab only the repo state at the v1.9.2 tag\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch v1.9.2 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git\n\nThen, go into the directory and run the cargo-install-all.sh script.\ncd solana\n./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .\necho \"export PATH=$PWD/bin:\\$PATH\" >> ~/.zshrc\n\n\nThis will take a while, but after it is finished, you can verify if the installation is successful with:\nsolana --version\n\nThere used to be an issue with solana-test-validator on M1 Macs, but the problem has been solved. You can try to spin it up to make sure it works.\n\nAnchor is the recommended framework for Solana programs.\nNote that Anchor uses Yarn v1 to manage Javascript dependencies in your project, so make sure you already have it installed on your computer.\nSince there’s no official binary available for the M1 architecture, we’ll also need to build from source:\ncargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.19.0 anchor-cli --locked\n\nThen, you can verify if the installation is successful with:\nanchor --version\n\n\nAnd that’s it.

My other project that I've been working on, the Backend Server, has 14 stars, 9 forks, and nearly 10 outside contributors. That might not sound like a lot, but both of these projects are only about a week old.\nSo, how did I do it?\nThe most important thing has been issues, which I talked about here. But, the second most important thing has been designing a great readme. \nA good readme is the difference between someone staring your project and someone ignoring it. If you have badges, easily understandable features, and lots of images, you have a star worthy repository. \nFirst, you need to have badges. If you don't know what a badge is, it's the little image that says how many stars, downloads, etc. a project has. These are also known as shields, and you can get them from this website. If you have a ton of them and they all say good things, it increases the confidence that someone has in your project. \nSecondly, you need easily understandable features. If you look at my newest repository, eaf-linter, you will see that all of the features have a simple headline and they link to a new page. This is very important. If your feature can link to a more in depth description of the feature, it will increase the confidence that the possible contributor has in your project. \nFinally, images are super important. In my backend server, I have a ton of really eye-catching images. These images increase the likelihood that someone will keep looking through your readme, and the longer that the person stays on your page, the more likely they are to star your repository. \nThere will be more tips like this coming tomorrow and the day after, so if you liked hearing this, make sure to follow me, so you can see more tips as they come out.\nAlso, our open-source, non-profit is hiring right now if you're interested.

I made an issue for it already, but I need to start working on it. And, that's where my question lies. \nI can either build the system to detect the duplications based on plain text. This is how most systems work because it is the simpler of the two options. But, it is also the most failure prone. For instance, this system would fail if there was the same exact code in two places, but there was a comment in the middle of one of them- it would not register as a duplicate.  \nAlternatively, I can use an abstract syntax tree to detect the duplications. But, theres another problem there- what is the most-lightweight and all-around-best javascript parser out there? I'm planning on using the babel parser but I'm already running into a problem because it doesn't parse the comments in a way I would like. \nSo, if you have an opinion on what I should do, please leave a comment below. Also, please star the project and contribute if you have time. If you can, that would be amazing, and I thank you so much!",

It triggers a notification to the runner I specified, and then it processes the series of tasks I specified.\nWhich involves building and deploying.\nThis is a legacy React project, and had long been updated. After upgrading the packages I git committed. Build built successfully but deployment failed. With the following error:\n\nI read through the error to understand what the problem really was, and I found it:\nModule.createRequire is not a function\n\nThat was the only error that was reasonably clear indeed and meant something.\nSo I Googled it, and I found out that it's an issue with Create React App, it's always on or looking for the latest, which means the Node engine version has to always be the latest and that includes my npm version, else some things might break.\nSo in essence whatever machine running that project has to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6\nMy GitLab-ci.yml contains a Docker image with a node version of 10.15.3, so there is a need to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nimage: giona69/node-10.15.3-aws-eb\n\nAnd I temporarily replaced the docker image with the latest node.\n\n\n\n\nimage: node:14.18.2\n\nRebuilt Node-Sass\nI added \nnpm rebuild node-sass \nAnd Voila!!

          "description": "Today we will learn how to create our own directives in Angular. In my previous posts I discussed all the built-in directives which Angular provided. If you are unaware, I would highly suggest you to start from the part_1 ( of the 6 series post).\nSo the first question that can strike you is why we need a custom directive when Angular already provided us with 6 amazing directives. The simple reason is there can be multiple scenarios where the exact requirements are not met using the built-in directives. In those cases we need to write our own logic to meet the requirement and custom directives comes to the rescue.\nNow, lets see how we can create our own custom directive.\nng generate directive <directive-name>\nng g d <directive-name>\nLets create a simple directive which when applied to an el…",

We use our phones for almost every day. We used to shop at malls, line up at banks, and plan our trips at agencies. But now, we can do all these things in our homes using smartphones. All of this is made possible by a high-level programming language called Java.\nJava is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) used on the Internet. Java is a high-level language that is also easy to read and understand. Using it, developers can write once and run anywhere, which means that compiled Java code runs on all Java-compatible platforms without the need to recompile.\nJames Gosling and Sun Microsystems invented the Java programming language in 1991.

Of course I knew they were important before - everybody does - but it's so easy to just push it aside and focus on more exciting code, or write some perfunctory tests that don't really, well, test anything. Eventually, however, slacking off on testing comes back to bite you; for me, luckily, it did when things were only getting started, but the point was clear - writing good tests is a top priority.\nFor Agrippa, however, writing good tests is far from trivial - it's a CLI for generating React components based on a project's environment (dependencies, existence of config files, etc.), as well as an optional .agripparc.json config.

When I am interviewing a candidate I try to make a conversation like: Tell me about your experience, the latest project you are working on, what technology you like the most, and why. I guess that they are trying to emulate top-tech companies like GAFAM, what I have heard about these companies is that the technical interviews are very focused on data structures and problem-solving (not sure if they are used in daily work).\nMy point is: if your company focuses on a specific product, ask what you're looking for, ask for the technologies you are currently using, please stop doing stupidly complex technical tests unless your company is currently using these techniques to solve complex problems.\nAnd as always, happy coding!.",

MicroPython is an incredible tool for rapidly prototyping and iterating on hardware projects. It's similar to Arduino but instead of using C++, which you have to re-compile each time you make a code change, it runs on the Python interpreter which allows you to run code changes immediately. The quick feedback cycle enabled by MicroPython will, I believe, power the future of embedded development.\nWhat is the \"hello world\" of embedded software? Why, blinking an LED, of course! In this first tutorial, we'll get you acquainted with the fundamentals of MicroPython and more importantly, the online simulator we'll be using for all the tutorials.

That's when I had a moment of realization. \nI decided to drop everything that I was doing and build a really simple API for duck jokes. Right now the API has a couple of jokes, but we need some more, so if you want to submit some, you can respond to this issue or you can just drop a pull request on this repository. \nYou can check out the joke API here and you can use it in any of your projects if you would like.

          "description": "来自 Matrix 机器人：\n在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。\n和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。\n\n从自我介绍开始\n我是 津津乐道播客网络 的创始人朱峰，从 2000 年开始创业，津津乐道算是我的第五个创业项目。津津乐道是一个播客制作机构，我们希望通过声音这个媒介，让各领域的专业人士分享他们的所见所闻和有意思的经验、观点。通过播客，让专业人士建立属于自己的个人品牌和影响力。截止到现在，我们已经制作了十多档节目，围绕一、二线城市，3–5 年工作经验的 TMT 从业者，提供他们感兴趣的音频内容。\n\n分享一件今年让你印象最深刻或者意义最重大的事\n如果五年后回头看，2021 年一定是平淡、承上启下的一年，我们经历了 2020 年疫情的震惊、对每个人生活的重大改变，2021 年我们都在尽力尝试建立新的秩序和生活方式，我不觉得 2021 年会有什么「重大」的事情，大家都在努力适应后疫情的新世界，可能就是 2021 最令人印象深刻的事情吧。\n过去一年，有没有哪些城市或地方是您想再去一次的？\n曾经津津乐道最受欢迎的节目类目是旅行，但因为疫情，大家将近 3 年没有出过国门了，而国内时常爆发的小范围疫情也让人很难下决心来一场远游。我们希望在疫情后，可以重新拜访我们曾经去过的每一座城市，看看那里的人、那里的事有了什么改变。为了这个计划，我们跟大约20多个城市的听友都约定好，到时候一定回去再看一看，与他们聊一聊疫情给大家带来了什么。\n如果让你用一个词概括自己的 2021 年，你会用什么词？\n「且看」——这是津津乐道节目的一个梗，很多无法当时给出结论的事情，我们都会用这个词来概括，而整个 2021，其实也映衬了这个词的必要性：多看少做，苟下来静观市场的变化，比盲目下结论、做决定重要得多。\n今年有学到什么新方法或新技能吗？\n今年我们系统性地学习和梳理了播客节目制作的 SOP，把我们这五年积累的经验变成标准，希望能够把绝大多数的节目制作变成一个可以复制的工业化流程，降低大家制作播客、参与播客的门槛，让每位并不精通内容制作的专业人士也能利用播客这个媒介讲出他们自己的故事。\n谈谈你的年度照片吧\n我们的节目又一次帮助一个创业团队完成了冷启动，这是一家现饮精酿啤酒品牌——BlueArk，通过播客节目的介绍，让用户、投资者在更多维度上更深入的认识、了解了他们，完成了他们的 MVP 验证和第一轮融资。这是抖、快这类「快内容」完全做不到的事情，我们很自豪。\n\n谈谈你的你的年度的电影吧\n非常惭愧的是，这一年读得书太少，唯一几本也是专业领域的书籍，似乎对大家没有特别大的推荐价值。但倒是可以给大家推荐一部电影——《大空头》。这部电影诞生于 2015 年，不是一部新片。但故事表达的观点在今天看来却是极具价值的：当大家都在狂欢的时候，冷静与理性是极为宝贵的。这一年，播客行业经历了很多事情，年初，「风口」这个关键词一次又一次的被提及，一度让大家觉得播客即将是下一个抖快，马上就要被风吹起来了。而年末的一地鸡毛告诉大家，理智的市场判断远比一次又一次的追逐风口宝贵得多，在现下的市场环境下，排除噪音，做好判断可能会比盲目的投入、扩张更为考验创业团队的经验。\n《大空头》电影海报，图片来自豆瓣\n推荐一个你的年度好物\n云鲸拖地机器人。扫地机器人很成熟了，但如果经常做家务你肯定会发现其实扫地以外，拖地更是刚需，而扫地机器人的拖地能力实在是比较鸡肋的，直到我们遇到这款几乎专门为拖地设计的设备。 因为工作特别忙，几乎不可能抽出时间每天拖地，现在只需要定时设置一个拖地任务，当扫地机器人工作完毕，就放出来云鲸来拖地。尤其是有宠物的家庭，懂的都懂。\n云鲸拖地机，图片来自云鲸\n展望一下你的 2022 年吧\n2021 年末，我们拿到了第一笔融资，团队也有所扩大。而播客仍旧是一个小众市场，我们希望通过我们的努力，帮助作者、主播们建立他们的内容优势，不仅在内容制作层面，在技术层面我们也准备把我们内部运营很多年的节目分发、托管平台拿出来给大家免费使用，还为此开发了动态广告投放的系统，帮助主播们更轻松的获得正反馈，鼓励他们把内容持续的做下去。2022 年可能仍旧是困难的一年，但我们总会看到希望的，不是么？\n> 少数派 2021 年度活动页面已上线，点此前往 查看更多「少数派们」的年度推荐 🙋‍♂️\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "引言\n时值期末季，不少读者或许还保留着当年寒假前领取成绩单的回忆。那张薄纸上的数字和话语，代表着对我们前一个阶段表现的评价。\n在科技行业中，Apple 可谓是被评价最为频繁的公司之一。由于影响力之广、用户数之多，似乎谁都能点评出一两句来。用户当然有权评价，但这样的评论确实容易偏于零散和即兴——Apple 的业务涉及好几条不同产品线、上百种不同型号，横跨软件、硬件和服务领域，它在不同方面的表现必然有高低之分；关于 Apple 的资讯动态连篇累牍，但同一件产品、同一个事件分别放在出现当时和一段时间之后观察，很可能就有不同的意义。\n因此，像成绩单那样，将过去一个时间段的整体表现分为多个「科目」、分别给予评价，或许是更有参考性、更能反映规律的做法。\n这也正是我们想要提出的问题：对于 Apple 在 2021 年的各方面表现，你打几分？\n需要说明，这一模式并不是我们的原创。从 2015 年开始，国外知名 Apple 领域博主 Jason Snell 每年均会制作称为《Apple Report Card》的同类选题（今年的结果尚未发表），已经形成了比较完善的格式，且积累了一定的趋势数据。\n然而，Jason Snell 调查的基本都是美国用户，其结果反映的也必然是美国用户的观点。作为在 Apple 用户中举足轻重的另一群体，中文用户理应发出体现自己独特视角的声音。\n为此，我们借鉴了这种模式，在 2021 年底，向 20 名具有一定影响力的中文 Apple 用户发出问卷，请他们从九个维度对 Apple 在 2021 年的表现作出评价。\n\n受访者中，既有 Apple 生态耕耘多年的开发者，也有见多识广的投资人；既有平时从事科技测评、影像制作的「专业」用户，也有用 Apple 产品处理日常工作学习的建筑行业、学术圈用户；其中不少还是少数派读者熟悉和喜爱的熟面孔。我们相信，这能比较全面地反映不同…",

          "description": "来自 Matrix 机器人\n在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。\n和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。\n\n介绍一下你自己\n你好吗！新年快乐！我是熊小默，一个视频创作者和短片导演。\n\n我以前做过杂志主编，呆过互联网公司，发过当艺术家的梦，但目前占据我生活最大块的是旅行和拍摄。我对设计史和摄影史很感兴趣，收藏珍版唱片和机械钟表，我的视频也太多围绕设计、艺术和流行文化展开。\n为什么喜欢机械表、怎么想到要做一档关于机械表的视频栏目？\n现在很多人把表看作是展现身份的奢侈品，一种阶层符号。但作为一个从初中开始就迷恋钟表的人，我把它看作机械奇迹。时间本身是不可客观度量的，但钟表能把它等块切分，靠的只是齿轮咬合。而在我们人类历史的很长一段时间里，报时的权力属于国王或教会，现代钟表则是把这种权力交还给普通人。\n\n我有一档视频栏目叫《HAND ON》，就是希望以诗歌化的语言，唯美的微观画面，来和大家分享在设计或历史意义上有值得一提之处的腕表。\n \n2021 年让你印象深刻的腕表或相关品牌？\n有几块风格迥异的腕表我很喜欢：\nHUBLOT 和村上隆的新一代合作款。\n\nOMEGA 的多用途计时器超霸 Chronoscope 腕表。\n\n宝珀的 5008D 无辐射版五十噚。\n\n希望通过《拍照的人》系列传达什么样的观点或者思考？\n《拍照的人》这组短片是想去纪录全国各地在拍照的年轻人，他们对于摄影有全新的理解，也把它用作不同于以往的表达手段。\n  \n在系列短片里，我很有意地避开「摄影师」这三个字，因为我不想把拍照这件事塑造成为职业化的，需要特殊训练的，有天赋才艺的人才能做的事。我希望展现拍照这个动作里直觉、本能、生活化的特质。\n\n拍照是每个现代年轻人命中注定的行为，只不过我希望这组短片能给大家一些寻找表达出口的启发。另外，这组短片也是希望密切地和地理发生关系的，能展现主人公和他们的家乡的关联。我们去了黔南、辽西、山西、潮汕地区、黑龙江，就是为了分享这种地理的差异性如何启发拍照。\n推荐 3 位你最喜欢的视频博主？\n@cbvivi、@苏兆阳Sudo、@flypig。\n从眼镜到腕表再到数码产品，你推荐过很多精美有趣的物件，你平时出门会带或者常用哪些装备？\n表我肯定会戴，我可以做到连续七周每天换表不重样。\n照相机我一般也会带，有拍摄工作时带 FX3，没有工作时我会带徕卡（但是是胶卷相机，而不是那台花了我很多钱的 M10-R black paint，非常让人失望的粗制滥造产品，买来基本没用）。还有润唇膏和耳塞，我基本时时刻刻在听点有的没的。\n\n推荐 3 样你的年度好物，并简单说说理由。\nDJI 新出的麦克风，非常好用，我们现在录播客已经全面改用这款无线麦了。\n\n永璞咖啡的榛果味胶囊，我的年度最大发现，便宜好喝香，泡起来很简单。\nAstell & Kern 的蓝牙音箱 Acro BE100，很美、很动听，还不贵。\n\n用一个词概括你的 2021 年，为什么？\n半空半满。\n我今年做了很多让自己骄傲的项目，但是呢，又感觉它们其实本来也在我能力之内，并没有太多进步。\n对于新的一年有哪些期待？\n希望2022可以学到、看到全新的东西。增加生命体验。\n> 少数派 2021 年度活动页面已上线，查看 更多「少数派们」的年度推荐 🙋‍♂️\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "非常简单地谈几句个人的看法。\n进入12月后，勇士队遭遇了一波进攻寒潮。11月，他们还能打出114.8分的百回合得分，而到了12月就只剩下了110.5分，在1月的三场比赛中更是低到了107.4分。相应地，球队核心库里也“难辞其咎”，个人百回合得分从11月的116.4分跌落到了12月的112.1、1月的110.2分，真实命中率更是从63.9%跌到了58.1%，1月份更是惨不忍睹的39.4%。\n对于造成勇士和库里如此下滑的原因，首先当然是库里个人的消耗问题。本赛季，库里在每回合之中、特别是进攻端的移动距离，比之17-18、18-19赛季，都有了一定的上涨。在曾经的勇士2.0时代，库里已经是一个拥有大量无球跑动、不断进行换位移动的进攻手，而本赛季的他则在本已不小的跑动量上进一步提高，来到了后卫中进攻跑动第九多的位置，且年过三十的年龄，也在加兰、科尔安东尼、德章泰穆雷等一众年轻人之中，显得格外突出。而在防守端，由于勇士一贯采取的集体换防策略，库里的跑动量自然也不会少，18-19赛季就有着后卫中第八多的防守移动，而本赛季也只是相对下降了0.07米。况且，我们还需要考虑到库里为了增强防守对位能力而采取的增重，对身体造成更大的负担。\n\n年龄的增加、体重的上升、移动的剧化，随着赛季的深入，这些问题逐渐开始影响库里，拉低了他的表现稳定性。这是每一个核心球星都必然面对的生涯阶段，出现波动，并不算非常离奇。而在此前的赛程中，勇士队也及时地找到了能为库里排忧解难、分担压力的替代者，乔丹普尔成为了球队的二号持球手，策动了相当比例的挡拆回合，也成为了比威少之于詹姆斯来得性价比远高的解压存在。\n然而，这样的良好趋势，却在12月开始，特别是到了1月份的几场比赛，开始出现了裂痕。对此，我们可以从阵容搭配中的变量来做初步把握。球队进攻最为气势如虹的11月，乔丹普尔场均拥有31.5分钟的出场时间，14.7次出手，…",

          "description": "常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。\n \n其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。\n\n\nPart 1|咨询前\n 确认专业资质和能力 \n\n1. 教育经历\n 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。\n比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。\n而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。\n\n\n\n国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：\n\n精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；\n临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；\n学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；\n私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。\n\n在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。\n2.执业资格\n除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。\n2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。\n\n\n\n但即便有证书，也…",

          "description": "众所周知，MOBA游戏网络效应好、社区属性强，自然增长极快。然而其初期推广难、用户累积慢、运营成本高等问题又总是令让众多厂商纷纷折戟。到今天，纵观市场，似乎只有《王者荣耀》和《无尽对决》曾杀出重围，获得人气与价值的双丰收。其他产品却没有这样好的运气了，不管是网易的《决战！平安京》，还是腾讯的《Arena of Valor》，纵使承载着极高期望和投入，却都没能够翻起太大水花，最终也不过是淹没于茫茫游戏之海，被众人所遗忘。\n\n2020年6月，腾讯和Pokemon Company共同宣布联手打造基于宝可梦IP的轻度MOBA手游《宝可梦大集结》，欲二度冲击海外市场。游戏于2021年7月登录Switch平台，同年9月登录移动端平台。令人惊讶的是，本作并没有照搬腾讯天美信手拈来的Dota式核心战斗模式，而是迎合轻度玩家喜好，从诸如《风暴英雄》和《Splatoon 2》的类MOBA游戏中汲取灵感，将游戏的重心，从杀敌推塔，转移到了收集能量、达阵得分上，让MOBA游戏走上了休闲娱乐的全新道路。腾讯希望依赖宝可梦的全球影响力来吸引到IP粉丝/泛用户，逐步扩圈，培养出更大的欧美MOBA玩家市场。那么，此番采用全新玩法与独特画风、针对不同目标用户群的《宝可梦大集结》，有没有帮助腾讯再下一城呢？\n\n从数据来看，上线三个月的《宝可梦大集结》在海外市场的表现可谓是高开低走。在声势浩大的首周发布后，游戏逐步暴露出新用户获取乏力、现有用户流失多、长期付费不如意等问题。这究竟是什么原因呢？本期《庖丁解游》就将为大家解析一下这款游戏：《宝可梦大集结》。\n\n\n（一）游戏循环：单局对战贯穿始终\n\n《宝可梦大集结》游戏核心循环示意如图，MOBA类游戏的核心循环简单明了，主要以单局对战为基础，在对战—变强—继续对战的链条上衍生诸多其他机制。对《宝可梦大集结》来说，在对战之外，玩家还可以在对战中累计胜场、获得金币，从而…",

Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world's tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn't see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town.

This glitch allows us to spawn unlimited Mugman clones, and can results in some extremely fast fights. This speedrun is one of my favorites\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the world record run here: https://youtu.be/WOvPL91CKTc\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nThis speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",

Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. \n\nCaptain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.",

          "description": "开源开发者自毁其广泛使用的依赖库\n\r\n开源库 colors.js 和 faker.js 被广泛使用。在 NPM 上，colors.js 的周下载量超过 2000 万次，有近 19000 个项目依赖它。前几天，它的开发者在这些库的最新版本中加入了无限循环和乱码，依赖它的项目会在控制台看到不停打印的非 ASCII 字符。他将这两个库的 自毁版本 推送到了 GitHub 和 NPM，因而导致多个使用这些依赖库的软件出现故障，其中包括亚马逊的 AWS CDK。这位开发者似乎是因为没有得到使用他的开源软件的大公司的 付费，而专门做了这种破坏。这件事引来了业界和社区的激烈讨论。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我认为，你可以因没有得到报酬而放弃项目，但是这不是你蓄意报复的理由。如果一开始就想着获益，请发布你的商业版本。这种最初遵循开源许可证和开源文化的开源软件，在邀名不成、获利不得后恼羞成怒地大肆破坏，或许没有违反许可证和法律，但是却给整个开源文化泼了一盆脏水。我对这种行为持反对意见。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMozilla 基金会其实从 2014 年就开始接受加密货币捐款\n\r\n之前我们报道过，Mozilla 基金会官方 Twitter 账号在 1 月 1 日提醒粉丝它接受加密货币，如比特币、以太坊的捐款，但这一声明招致了 猛烈批评，最终迫使 Mozilla 基金会宣布 暂停 接受加密货币捐款。但实际上 Mozilla 基金会从 2014 年就开始 接受加密货币捐款，当时 Mozilla 还列举了其它接受加密货币捐款的组织，如可汗学院、电子前沿基金会、绿色和平组织和维基媒体基金会。到今天，只有绿色和平组织停止接受加密货币捐款。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：加密货币是否该死，我觉得不能用政治正确来评判。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWindows 11 上仍能使用软驱和软盘\n\r\n去年发布的 Windows 11 系统，调整了硬件安装需求，很多硬件都不再支持，需要使用较新的 CPU 和 TPM 2.0 等等。但是，有用户发现，Windows 11 上居然还可以成功使用索尼 5.25 寸软盘。这意味着，Windows 11 对外部设备还保留了不错的兼容性。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 5.25 寸、3.5 寸软盘已经基本退出历史舞台，可在特定领域依然有用武之地，但这个反差让我有些吃惊。",

          "description": "最近，多数读者可能已经了解到了一些关于 Log4j 漏洞的信息，这个漏洞自从 12 月 9 日披露出来之后，不断给系统管理员增加烦恼。这个漏洞比较容易利用，可以用来进行远程代码执行，而且整个互联网上的服务器中到处都有这个问题。把它称为近年来被披露的最糟糕的漏洞之一，并不算夸张。从某种意义上来说，从 Log4j 中得到的教训并没有什么新的内容，但这个漏洞确实进一步明确地突出了自由软件生态系统中的一些问题。\n\r\n出了什么问题？\n\r\n有很多文章详细描述了这个 bug 的机制，以及如何利用，在这个 页面 上就收集了很多。简而言之：Log4j™ 是一个 Java 日志软件包，由 Apache 软件基金会注册了商标并进行发布。它已经被包含进了许多其他项目，在互联网上到处都可以找到 Log4j。事实上，根据这篇 文章，Log4j 已经被下载了超过 2800 万次（仅仅统计了过去四个月里的情况）并且是将近 7000 个其他项目的依赖项。因此，Log4j 中的漏洞很可能就会成为碰巧使用了它的那些其他系统中的漏洞。\n\r\n正如 Apache 软件基金会在 6 月份自豪地发出的一条 推文 所说，它甚至也存在于火星上的灵巧号直升机之中。\n\r\n通常情况下，人们认为一个日志工具应该只是把感兴趣的数据接收下来并可靠地记录下来。Log4j 似乎做到了这一点，但它也做了一些可以说是任何日志系统都不应该做的事情：它主动地对要记录的数据进行解释、并相应地采取行动。它可以做的事情之一就是查询远程服务器的数据，并将其纳入日志信息中。例如，它可以从 LDAP 服务器获取信息并加入到日志中，这样在人们希望在日志中加入某个用户的详细账户信息的数据时，这个功能就会很有用。\n\r\n然而，事实上远程目录服务器可以提供更多形式的数据，比如说可以提供一个序列化处理（serialized）的 Java 对象，被后续重新组装起来进行执行。…",

          "description": "英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中引入一个特殊的变化，可以在不重启系统的情况下更新系统固件。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n去年发现的几个安全漏洞，使得系统管理员很难在不停机的情况下迅速修补系统。\n\r\n如果能做出一些改进，在不重启系统的情况下更新一些关键组件以提高安全/性能呢？\n\r\n英特尔旨在通过其新的 PFRUT（平台固件运行时更新和遥测Platform Firmware Runtime Update and Telemetry）驱动程序来实现这一目标。\n\r\n英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中提供 PFRUT\n\r\n虽然 Linux 内核 5.16 将在本周晚些时候发布，不过英特尔的目标是将这一新的功能合并到即将发布的 Linux 内核 5.17 稳定版。\n\r\n但是，它究竟是什么？\n\r\n有了 PFRUT 驱动，特定组件（或系统固件）可以在系统运行时进行更新，而不需要重新启动。\n\r\n最初，英特尔倾向于将其称为“无缝更新”解决方案。然而，随着最近被添加到 Linux 电源管理的 linux-next 分支中的 Linux 内核提交，他们可能会继续使用一个厂商中立的名字，即 pfrut_driver。\n\r\n顺便说一句，linux-next 分支代表着这些变化将进入下一个 Linux 内核稳定版（5.17）。\n\r\n在技术上，这个 提交 对该变化的解释如下：\n\r\n\r\n用户应该提供 EFI 封包，并通过将该封包写入设备的特殊文件以将其传递给驱动程序。驱动程序在特定的 ACPI 平台固件运行时更新ACPI Platform Firmware Runtime Update设备（INTC1080）的 ACPI _DSM 方法的帮助下，将封包传输到平台固件，而实际的固件更新是由平台固件中的低级管理模式代码进行的。\n\r\n\r\n就像人们通常期望的那样，这应该可以消除停机时间，可以对解决任何安全和性能改进的固件进行基本更新。而且，系统固件更新可以很容易地直接通过操作系统（这里是 Linux）进行。\n\r\n正如其中一个 详细说明其工作原理的 PDF 文件 中强调的那样，驱动程序的遥测部分是为了 “从 MM 中检索日志信息，以进行监控并找出问题的根本原因”。\n\r\n请注意，这只有在 Linux 系统和英特尔芯片上才能实现。\n\r\n考虑到当你需要修补系统固件以抵御安全问题时，等待系统上的任务完成不是一种理想状况，这种能力的增加应该是非常方便的。\n\r\n这是为 Linux 桌面或服务器准备的吗？\n\r\n该改进主要是为服务器专用硬件量身定做的。\n\r\n英特尔的官方文件指出，这是为具有高服务水平协议（SLA）的系统准备的，这种 SLA 需要尽量减少重启。\n\r\n然而，这对拥有企业级系统的特定桌面用户群应该也是有用的。\n\r\n虽然这可能不是桌面 Linux 发行版必不可少的东西，但它可能是改善用户体验的一个令人兴奋的开始。特别是对于热衷于保持系统固件更新而不严重干扰其工作的用户。\n\r\n这也应该可以引入更多类型的更新的可能性，当涉及到 BIOS 或 UEFI 时，可以由操作系统而不是主板处理。\n\r\n这不仅限于为你的桌面配置服务器级别的硬件的 Linux 桌面用户。\n\r\n虽然目前只限于 Linux 系统，但这也应该很快可以用于 Windows 和其他操作系统。\n\r\n你对英特尔推出的这一变化有何看法？你认为这是对系统固件更新处理方式的一个重大改进吗？\n\r\n欢迎在下面的评论中分享你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/intel-linux-kernel/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这组文章展示了企业如何与开源软件连接。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开源软件不仅仅创造了专有软件的替代品。在商业方面，开源已经成为一个“力量的倍增器”来改变组织的经营方式。同时，越来越多的公司开始采用更多的开源方法，甚至在管理团队和流程方面。\n\r\n在过去的一年里，我们发表了许多优秀的文章，展示了企业如何与开源软件相联系。以下是一些阅读量最大的文章：\n\r\n《开源给你带来竞争优势的 4 种方式》\n\r\n为了在当今快节奏的世界中取得成功，企业必须对数字解决方案进行明智的投资，使他们能够更快地行动并提高运营的灵活性。这正是越来越多的各种规模和各种行业的组织拥抱开源解决方案的原因。根据麦肯锡的一份报告，开源的采用是表现优异的组织的最大差异化因素。Jason Blais 写了采用开源技术可以帮助组织推动竞争优势和体验更好的业务成果的 四个原因。\n\r\n《为什么 Crate.io 回归其纯粹的开源根源》\n\r\n开源技术提供企业级的可扩展性、性能、安全性和可靠性。信任就在那里，而且是当之无愧的。但除了顽固的开源信徒之外，较少被人称道的是日常社区贡献的内部运作，在原子级别建立了这些宏观利益。对于那些提供开源技术的人来说，社区不断的用户驱动的测试和加固将这些技术锻造成强大和成熟的解决方案。Crate.io 的联合创始人 Bernd Dorn 写道，该组织从“开放核心” 转变 为采用 Apache 2.0 许可的纯开源。\n\r\n《为什么非营利组织选择开源软件》\n\r\n随着科技和数据安全意识的提高，开源软件比以往任何时候都更成为各阶层组织的首选。非营利组织在财务方面尤其脆弱，同时又要处理重要的社会和环境问题。Michael Korotaev 以 Nextcloud 和 ONLYOFFICE为 例，写了关于在非营利组织中 采用开源协作技术 的文章。\n\r\n《管理开源产品路线图》\n\r\n客户，以及与他们交谈的销售和营销团队，都喜欢一个路线图。它让他们了解什么是现实的，什么是不现实的。路线图也是一个产品的核心。Scott McCarty 写了关于 管理开源产品路线图 的文章，以及为什么专有产品的路线图与建立在开源供应链上的产品没有什么不同。产品经理与客户交谈，对他们的需求进行排序，制定路线图，然后找出如何通过建设、购买和合作来提供能力。\n\r\n《将开源产品推向市场》\n\r\n产品营销和计划中的信息传递的作用对于一个成功的发布至关重要。Scott McCarty 继续他关于开源供应链中的产品管理的系列文章，讨论了 开源和产品营销的交叉点。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/12/open-source-software-business\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "新的插件可以防止从网上复制代码\n\r\nJetBrains 发布了一个 AntiCopyPaster 开源插件，可以防止复制和粘贴代码。研究人员观察到，虽然“复制和粘贴构成了编写代码的一个重要部分”，但这样做会导致代码维护、安全问题和许可证问题。由于开发者倾向于抄袭，有很多重复的代码在四处飘荡。截至 2017 年，GitHub 上约有 70% 的代码 来自复制的文件。AntiCopyPaster 会监控 IDE 中的粘贴代码，并扫描目标文件中的 Java 方法以找出重复的内容。该插件在粘贴操作后会等待一段时间，以允许对复制的代码进行编辑。只有当克隆的代码没有被改变时，该插件才会继续检查粘贴的片段是否原样复制的代码。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来以后 ICP 程序员难混咯。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n阿里巴巴为 Linux 内核调度器提出组平衡器概念\n\r\n越来越多的组织为了发展云计算等业务而配置他们的服务器在应用程序之间共享 CPU 核心/资源，而不是将某个 CPU 核心专门分配给单个应用程序/任务。阿里巴巴为 Linux 内核调度器提出一个新的“组平衡器”概念，以提升系统资源利用。这个平衡器的重点是在各组 CPU 核心之间平衡各组任务。这是一种缓解共享模式下冲突的方法，使组尽可能地排他，以获得性能和资源效率。在一台 128 核 CPU 服务器上的基准测试发现，与标准共享模式相比，Redis 在组平衡器模式下可以提升 2~10% 的性能。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：现在越来越多的看到了中国开发者在内核前沿做出更深入的探索和研究。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n夸大其词的 CleanCache 补丁将在十年后从 Linux 内核中删除\n\r\nCleanCache 是由 Oracle 开发的，在推出时他们宣称它是“非常酷的东西，有巨大的潜力超级优化运行的虚拟机的性能，是相当多的研究和实验的结果。”它有可能在许多环境中以可忽略的成本大幅提高许多工作负载的页面缓存效率。十年后的今天，CleanCache 已经没有任何内核代码在使用它们了，因此，它很可能在 Linux 5.17 中 被主线移除。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这种新陈代谢挺好，要不 Linux 内核越来越臃肿了。",

          "description": "如果你最开始使用的是 Windows 电脑，你很可能会使用“文件夹folder”这个术语。\n\r\n但当你换到 Linux 时，你会发现文件夹通常被称为“目录directory”。\n\r\n这可能使一些新的 Linux 用户感到困惑。你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？它们有区别吗？\n\r\n事情是这样的。如果你愿意，你可以叫它文件夹，如果你喜欢，也可以叫它目录。这没有什么区别。\n\r\n但是，如果你想知道为什么文件夹在 Linux 中被称为目录，这里有一些解释。\n\r\n为什么在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录？\n\r\n在我解释之前，让我们回顾一下文件夹和目录在现实世界中的用途。\n\r\n在现实中，文件夹（封套）可以用来保存几个文件（或其他项目）。而目录则可以用来维护项目的索引，这样你就可以找到哪个项目位于哪里。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，让我们回到目录。这个词甚至在 Linux 存在之前就已经存在了。它来自 UNIX 时代。Linux 继承了 UNIX 的很多东西，这只是其中的一个。\n\r\n现在让我告诉你一些可能让你吃惊的事情。目录并不是真的把文件放在里面。目录是一个“特殊的文件”，它知道文件在存储中的位置（通过 inode）。\n\r\n这就说明了为什么它被称为目录。目录用来保存项目的索引，而不用保存项目本身。Linux 和 UNIX 中的目录并不保存它里面的文件。它们只是记录文件位置的信息。\n\r\n如果你想了解更多关于它的信息，我这篇关于 硬链接 的文章应该可以帮助你。\n\r\n那么，为什么它被称为文件夹呢？依我看，这是视角的原因。当你在一个图形环境中时，你会将事物可视化。在这里，文件可以像页面一样被可视化，这些文件页面被存储在一个封套（文件夹）中。\n\r\n当操作系统开始使用图形元素时，我认为一些术语也相应地发生了变化，目录 -> 文件夹就是其中之一。\n\r\n你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？\n\r\n这完全取决于你。你可以按你的习惯使用这两个术语。\n\r\n然而，如果你正在学习 Linux 命令行或经常使用它，使用目录这个术语可能会有一点帮助。\n\r\n有一些 Linux 命令，如 mkdir、rmdir 等，术语 “dir” 给出了一个提示，即这些命令与目录有关。\n\r\n同样，许多 Linux 命令和 bash 脚本会使用选项 -d 表示目录，-f 表示文件。\n\r\n甚至终端中的文件属性也会通过在目录前面加上字母 “d” 来区分文件和文件夹（目录）。\n\r\n拿这个例子来说，我有一个名为 some 的文件和一个名为 something 的文件夹/目录。请注意各种 Linux 命令是如何用 “dir” 或 “d” 来区分文件和目录的。\n\r\n\n\r\n所有这些让我觉得，在使用 Linux 命令时，使用 “目录” 这个术语会有好处。你的潜意识会更容易将 “dir” 和 “d” 与目录联系起来。\n\r\n再说一次，你想叫它文件夹或目录这完全取决于你。人们会明白你指的是什么。\n\r\n我刚刚对目录一词的历史渊源做了一些分析，这应该会给你一些提示，为什么人们说 “在 Linux/UNIX 中，所有东西都是一个文件”。\n\r\n现在我结束了我的胡言乱语，我请你对它进行评论。如果你发现任何技术上的不准确之处，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/folder-directory-linux/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "除了 System76 宣布了基于 RUST 的新桌面环境之外，还有别的团队也给桌面 Linux 用户带来了一些新东西。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n过去的几年里，我们很欣慰地看到 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队正在扩大他们对 Linux 社区的影响。如今，伴随着全新 Maui Shell 的发布，他们的影响也已经得到了进一步扩大。\n\r\n让我们一起来看看吧！\n\r\n关于 Maui 项目的一些背景介绍\n\r\n\n\r\n作为由 Nitrux Linux 团队原班人马创建、开发、维护的项目，Maui 项目已经开发了许多基础应用。实际上，他们的文件管理器 Index 甚至成功进入了我们的 2021 年五大应用列表 之中！\n\r\n他们的所有应用均使用 MauiKit 这款定制框架开发。基于 Kirigami 的 MauiKit 专注于跨终端融合性，因此开发出来的应用可以在电脑和手机端拥有一致的体验。此外，它为开发者提供了更多的预置组件，因此创建应用可以更加便捷。\n\r\n目前 Maui 项目开发的部分应用包括：\n\r\n\r\nIndex（文件管理器）\n\r\nNota（文本编辑器）\n\r\nVVave（音乐播放器）\n\r\nClip（视频播放器）\n\r\nPix（图片查看器）\n\r\n\r\n虽然这些自制应用本身质量不错，但它们在 Nitrux Linux 的默认桌面环境 KDE Plasma 里总显得不合群。因此，Maui Shell 应运而生。\n\r\nMaui Shell 介绍\n\r\n\n\r\n借助与 Maui 应用相同的 MauiKit 和 Qt 技术底层，Maui Shell 是 Nitrux 在桌面环境领域的一个新尝试。从上面的截图可以看出，它在很大程度上受到了 GNOME Shell 的启发，这在使用过程中也确实有所体现。\n\r\n但，这并不意味着 Maui Shell 没有原创的地方。从底部上滑可打开类似于 GNOME “活动”的概览界面。与此相邻的是一个小 Dock，可以通过相当美观的启动器来启动应用。右上角有一个与 macOS 相似的控制中心，内有精心设计的菜单和许多控制功能。\n\r\n在我使用它的过程中，一切都是如此精致、自然。我感觉这与它极致现代、扁平的设计美学有关，我甚至认为 Maui Shell 已经超越了 GNOME 和 KDE Plasma 等同类软件。说到 Plasma，与 Nitrux 的默认 Plasma 版本相比，Maui Shell 在低端设备（和虚拟机）上的反应更加灵敏。\n\r\n总的来说，我预测 Maui Shell 将依靠其实用性成为 “Linux 桌面环境之王”。然而，我还没谈到 Maui Shell 最核心的特性：跨终端自适应性Convergence。\n\r\n主流之中的融合\n\r\n许多人可能还记得 2010 年 Canonical 开发了一款类似的跨终端桌面环境 Unity，它最终以失败落幕，到 2018 年则被完全淘汰了。但是，Unity 和 Maui Shell 有一个共同特性 —— 那就是跨终端融合性。\n\r\n随着 Linux 在移动端的开发力度逐渐加大，跨终端支持变得尤为重要。由此来看，一个新的桌面环境竟能同时支持桌面端和移动端，的确不可思议。\n\r\n这一点必须依靠大量的跨终端应用实现，而 Maui 已经处在了完美的衔接点上。这仅仅是我相信 Maui Shell 能成为 Linux 桌面未来的原因之一。\n\r\n立即试用 Maui Shell\n\r\n与其他新发布的软件不同，Maui Shell 已经预装于新发布的 Nitrux 1.8。如果你想亲自尝试一下，那请随时从下方链接中获取 ISO 镜像。但是，在尝试之前，请务必知晓：Maui Shell 仍处于早期开发阶段。\n\r\n尽管 Maui Shell 拥有许多特色功能，但部分功能可能存在问题、尚未实现，要么就是缺失了，其中包括：\n\r\n\r\n蓝牙支持\n\r\nPulseAudio 支持\n\r\n网络开关\n\r\n媒体控制（MPRIs）\n\r\n拖放支持\n\r\n多显示器支持\n\r\n设置应用\n\r\nXWayland Shell 插件\n\r\n\r\n因此，我暂时不能建议你使用 Maui Shell 作为主力桌面环境。为此，你可能需要等待 2022 年秋季发布的正式版本。\n\r\n在此之前，我仍将持续关注 Maui Shell。对于这款桌面环境，你的评价如何？欢迎在评论区说出你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/maui-shell-unveiled/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lujun9972 译者：imgradeone 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "最初的标题是「试论学习效率」，但仔细一想又觉得技巧与工具大同小异，讲与效率相关的拖延症也是老生常谈。因此在这里试图抛砖引玉，探讨这个至今我难以解答的问题：为什么我们会对有关「提高效率」，「提升自我」这一课题无法自拔。\n为什么关注效率？\n首先，为什么要关心效率？自我反省下来，原因不多：\n\n人一生的时间是有限的。\n每个人的一天都是24个小时\n为了在更短的时间内，比别人学得更多，然后获得某种意义上的胜利。\n\n最后一点的无奈之处在于，只有「更多」才能在他人面前表现出来。因为即便是浅层的理解，通常在面试和聊天环境下也不会过于深入的讨论。\n但是我们都清楚， 质量更为重要。\n高效率 = 完成更多；高效率 ≠ 高质量？\n在这集 How to Structure Your Writing Day with Francesco Cirillo @ Become a Writer Today 播客里，主持人邀请了番茄钟的创始人来分享他对时间管理的看法：「我们应该把时间看作朋友而不是敌人，否则就失去了对自我的掌控。」\n在博客里，他分享了番茄钟常见的错误使用：\n\n设置超长番茄钟：把一个番茄钟的时常限制在40分钟以内的原因是为了能让今天的第一个番茄钟和最后一个番茄钟能进行同等质量的工作。\n忽视短休息的重要性：人们通常跳过短休息，亦或者在休息期间没有放空大脑（依旧想着手头上的事）。\n\n产生这两个错误的原因归根结底其实就是害怕会打断心流，害怕我们要因为重新酝酿（或等待）「动力」而浪费时间，但是往往这么做反而让自身在工作面前失去了掌控力。因为当你开始害怕被打断时，时间就成为了你的敌人，而你要让时间成为你的盟友。\n在 Paul Graham 的 博客 How to Work Hard 里提到，努力最重要的是质量，时间（effort）和天赋（talent）占比不大。这与卡尔·纽波特的《深度工作》核心观点一致，其…",

          "description": "一、前言\n众所周知，Android中是通过WindowManger来添加、删除和更新视图，也就是WindowManager提供的addView、removeView和updateViewLayout方法。但是在添加或移除View的代码逻辑是啥，在这期间做了哪些工作，调用removeView方法就真的立刻删除view了吗？本文正是针对这些问题，对相关系统源码做了一次梳理和分析。作为一次学习源码过程，希望对相关知识点做到既能用，也明白底层原理。\n在详细梳理代码前，首先我们先明确一下View的这些操作方法在哪里声明的，实现是怎样的，调用链路是啥。\n1、「增删改」的View操作方法都是在ViewManager接口中声明的\npublic interface ViewManager\n{\n    /**\n     * Assign the passed LayoutParams to the passed View and add the view to the window.\n     * \nThrows {@link android.view.WindowManager.BadTokenException} for certain programming\n     * errors, such as adding a second view to a window without removing the first view.\n     * \nThrows {@link android.view.WindowManager.InvalidDisplayException} if the window is on a\n     * secondary {@link Display} and the specified display can't be found\n     * (se…",
