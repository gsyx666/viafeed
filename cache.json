We love our terminal as it's our home base.\nSo whenever a new terminal pops up, I have to try it at least.\nI love and use iTerm2 for almost everything. But Warp is the new kid on the block, and although it comes with some downsides, it's pretty slick!\nTry our Warp here\nThis new terminal is made from scratch, not based on what we already know about terminals.\nThis, to me, is what makes it so cool. The whole terminal experience changes and makes it feel like a native app.\nIt's super quick to autocomplete and separate commands, so it's easy to understand which output belongs to which command.\nBesides these apparent wins, it's also super fast and comes with Intellisense for npm and git. You'll never forget a command this way.\n\nTo be honest, there are always downsides, aren't there.\nIt's only available for Mac, but the team seems to be working hard on a Windows and Linux version.\nIt's not open source, this might not be a bad hard point, but for some people, that's a deal-breaker.\nYou need to log in, which seems weird to use a terminal.\nI hope they are not using this personal data to keep track of our terminal usage, as it's now connected to a user profile.\nWorth a try if you're on Mac. It's pretty awesome to use.\nTry our Warp here\nThank you for reading my blog. Feel free to subscribe to my email newsletter and connect on Facebook or Twitter",

As a beginner I was making the same mistake again and again. But from the Free Code Camp's Youtube channel I found Per Harald Borgen's free beginner level full Javascript course. It was a interactive course on Scrimba.com.\nIt was important for me to practice online to boost my journey. I know you may ask their are many online code learning platform's then why Scrimba !!! then here are some answers why as newbie should learn JS from Scimba's Learn JavaScript for free !\n1. If you haven't a high end device:- For this course you only need a PC(1 GB Ram),Internet and a browser(Chrome suggested). Your journey will not stop due to lack of resources. You don't need to run several application to start.\n2.If you're a beginner:-I struggled hard to learn code by self ,in the way to my web development journey. I love to learn things by doing practical application in real world. This course will teach you Javascript by creating three projects like Passenger counter app, Blackjack game and a chrome extension.\n3.Fun and Zero distraction:- While learning from Youtube as a newbie I was so distracted by other recommended videos. In this course it was simple for me to stay focused. This course is amazingly delivered by Mr. Per . You will learn several things by doing challenges in this course.\nMy Suggestion to beginners:-After searching several platform's  I would suggest to learn Javascript from Scrimba. Don't waste so much time on watching random videos one after one to learn. It's a 7 hour long video and I assure you that you're  going to enjoy it.\nFor Mr. Per:- Hello sir ! thanks for your teaching. Your course impacted my life. It's my humble gratitude to you. Thanks a lot.\nI hope this review will help you to start journey in a productive way.\nIf you are reading this I will happy that we will stay connected.

          "description": "计算机历史博物馆恢复了 21 部 1976 年传奇性计算机会议的视频\n\r\n在 1976 年夏天，来自世界各地的数十位计算机领域的顶级工程师、科学家和软件先锋们聚集在一起，在美国洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室聚会了五天，回顾了计算机界的前 25 年历史。在这些修复的视频中，与会者们讲述了许多当时鲜为人知的事情。比如，美国最早的大型电子计算机 ENIAC 的共同发明人约翰•毛奇里讨论了它的严重问题，ENIAC 必须每天 24 小时保持通电，以保持其 18000 个真空管的健康。计算机历史学家布莱恩•兰德尔教授首次披露了英国二战时期破译德军密码的专用计算机，还介绍了艾伦•图灵在二战时发挥的重大作用。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CHM\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：之前在翻译红帽《代码英雄》系列播客时接触过这段历史的一部分，真是想想波澜壮阔啊。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n秘密运行中的世界上最强大的超级计算机\n\r\n在最近一期的 TOP500 中，美国橡树岭国家实验室建造的 Frontier 以第一个 E 级超算夺得了榜首。TOP500 测量的是一台机器通过运行名为 LINPACK 基准的软件解决大量方程式的速度，这给出了一个以每秒浮点运算（FLOPS）为单位的数值。但并不是所有的超级计算机都会被列出，只有在其所有者运行该基准并提交结果的情况下才会出现在榜单。很多机构，包括一些大学都不会提交其基准数据来加入榜单。超级计算机专家们的 共识 是，中国自 2021 年以来至少有两台被称为“海洋之光”和“天河三号”的超大规模机器在运行，并且正在由曙光研发的第三台超算达到了 2E 级。这些“秘密”超算的数据是通过一些不相关的论文披露出来的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：MSN\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：只能说通过上榜来获取自信心的时代已经过去了，现在大家都埋头竞争呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n通用汽车用 3D 打印来解决汽车生产短缺的零件\n\r\n通用汽车在 2020 年对 3D 打印技术进行了重大投资，建立了 1.5 万平方英尺面积的增材制造中心。雪佛兰的工程师们对一款新的 SUV 的设计做了一个后期改动，需要创造一个额外的零件，以填补了尾部的一个缺口。开发注射成型的模具将花费太多时间，从而延误了 3 万辆汽车的交付。通过 3D 打印，工程师们能够快速设计并使用符合通用汽车标准的柔性材料打印出这些部件。而从设计到完成只用了五个星期。这还不到走注射成型路线所需时间的一半。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNET\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然成本高点，但是在这种应急的时候还真是非常灵活，也节省了很多时间成本。",

          "description": "虽然音乐世界被流媒体服务所主导，但这并没有阻止开发者为桌面电脑创建音乐播放器。\n\r\n最近，我发现了一个外观漂亮的新的 Linux 桌面音乐播放器。它名为 Amberol，我被它的美丽所震撼。\n\r\n\n\r\n看起来不错，不是吗？让我们仔细看看它。\n\r\nAmberol，Linux 上的可爱的音乐播放器\n\r\n看起来不错是它所做的两件（或几件）事情中的一件。另一件事是播放音乐。\n\r\n这就是它，Amberol 没有额外的花哨（和有用）的功能，如生成专辑封面、元数据编辑、歌词显示或播放列表和库管理。\n\r\n这些功能也不像是会在未来的版本中加入。Amberol 只想播放音乐。就是这样。\n\r\n令人惊叹的用户界面\n\r\nAmberol 和大多数新的 GNOME 应用一样，是用 Rust 和 GTK 编写的。\n\r\n它有一个自适应的用户界面，可以根据你正在播放的专辑颜色来改变颜色。渐变效果给了它一个现代、时尚的外观，肯定会成为你的 Linux 美化Ricing截图的一部分。\n\r\n\n\r\n由于其 UI 没有传统的手柄和菜单，它给应用一个统一的外观。\n\r\n播放列表\n\r\n它会从你添加的文件夹中的文件自动生成一个播放列表，显示在左手边的侧边栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以在左上角看到整个播放列表将播放多长时间的音乐。点击“勾选”符号，你可以选择歌曲，并从播放列表中删除它们。\n\r\n如果你愿意，可以隐藏播放列表的侧边栏。\n\r\n\n\r\n音乐播放选项\n\r\n你可以在界面上看到歌曲的进度。该播放器与键盘上的媒体控制按钮整合得很好。你可以用专用的媒体键来播放、暂停和改变曲目（如果你的系统上有）。\n\r\nAmberol 为你提供了一些播放音乐的选项。你可以打开随机播放功能，按随机顺序播放音乐。你也可以单曲循环，直到你厌倦它。\n\r\n\n\r\n底部的汉堡菜单让你可以选择添加文件或文件夹，并显示可用的键盘快捷方式。\n\r\n\n\r\n你也可以从这里禁用 UI 颜色变化以配合专辑封面。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Amberol\n\r\nAmberol 是 以 Flatpak 形式提供的。请确保 你的系统已启用 Flatpak 支持。\n\r\n要安装 Amberol，请打开终端并使用以下命令：\n\r\nflatpak install flathub io.bassi.Amberol\r\n\n\r\n安装完毕后，在菜单中搜索该应用，并点击启动。\n\r\n第一次运行时，它会要求你添加音乐文件或文件夹。你也可以拖放文件播放。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\n就个人而言，我更喜欢流媒体服务，因为我没有本机音乐珍藏。但我知道有的人有大量的 CD 收藏，现在都保存在硬盘上。\n\r\nAmberol 是一个外观漂亮的应用，对于播放本机音乐来说，它足够好。最吸引人的是它基于专辑封面的自适应用户界面。\n\r\n请你试试它，并在评论区分享你的经验。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/amberol-music-player/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "嗨，伙计们，在这篇指南中，我们将演示如何在 Windows 11 的之外配置 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS（Jammy Jellyfish）的双启动设置。\n\r\n为使其能工作，你需要在你的计算机上已经安装好了 Windows 11 。接下来，你将需要在你的硬盘驱动器上创建一个单独的分区，你将在此分区上安装 Ubuntu 22.04 。我们将包含这点知识，因此不要担心。\n\r\n前置条件：\n\r\n在设置双启动前，这些是你所需要的：\n\r\n\r\n一个 Ubuntu 22.04 的可启动 USB 驱动器，你可以转到 Ubuntu 22.04 下载页面 来下载 Ubuntu 22.04 的 ISO 镜像文件。在 ISO 镜像文件到位后，拿一个 16GB USB 驱动器，并使用 Rufus 应用程序来使其可启动。\n\r\n快速稳定的互联网连接\n\r\n\r\n步骤 1、在你的硬盘驱动器上创建一个可用的分区\n\r\n正如介绍中所提到的，我们首先需要在硬盘驱动器上创建一个单独的分区，我们将在其中安装 Ubuntu 22.04 。\n\r\n因此，通过按下 Windows + R 组合键来打开磁盘管理器实用程序。\n\r\n在对话框中，输入 diskmgmt.msc ，并按下回车键。\n\r\n\n\r\n磁盘管理disk management控制台将显示当前磁盘分区，如你将在下面所看到的一样。我们将通过压缩 “卷 E” 来创建一个用于安装 Ubuntu 的分区。这在你的安装过程中可能有所不同，但是只需要跟着做，你就会理解其中的大体意思。\n\r\n\n\r\n因此，在你想要压缩的磁盘驱动器卷上点击鼠标右键，并在弹出的菜单中选择 压缩卷Shrink 选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n将会出现一个弹出对话框，如下所示。具体指定压缩的控件大小（以 MB 为单位），并单击 压缩卷Shrink 。\n\r\n这是指定给 Ubuntu 22.04 安装所用的空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n在缩…",

          "description": "Linux 发现一个“几乎不能被检测到”的寄生木马\n\r\n安全研究人员发现了一款名为 “Symbiote”（共生体）的恶意软件。他们称其“几乎不可能被检测到”。它会“寄生感染”系统，感染所有正在运行的进程，并为提供 Rootkit 功能、远程访问等。它最早在 2021 年 11 月被发现，似乎是针对金融部门特别开发的。它不是一个以感染机器的独立可执行文件的形式运行的，而是以一个共享对象库的形式加载到所有正在运行的进程中，并寄生感染机器。它采用了多种规避检测的手段，来隐藏文件、进程和网络流量，甚至能让 BPF 工具也无法发现其网络流量。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：黑莓\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实通过共享对象库寄生的木马并不稀奇，只是这个木马做了更多的隐藏手段，可见现在针对 Linux 的木马也越来越强大隐蔽了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nUbuntu 正在改进对低成本 RISC-V 主板 VisionFive 的支持\n\r\n最近 Ubuntu 开发人员一直在努力提高和改善对赛昉科技的 VisionFive 单板机的支持，有望在 Ubuntu 22.10 中看到对这种低于 180 美元的 RISC-V 计算机的良好支持。VisionFive 是为数不多的不超过 200 美元的、能运行完整 Linux 发行版的 RISC-V 主板之一。自 Linux 5.17 内核开始，就对 VisionFive v1 板提供了主线支持。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：目前这个板子还是比较缺货的，希望能在 Ubuntu 等发行版提供更好的支持时能解决供货问题。有对在这个板子上运行 Ubuntu 感兴趣的同学吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n推特联合创始人宣布 Web3 的竞争对手：Web5\n\r\n推特联合创始人 Jack Dorsey 认为 Web3 变得和之前的 Web2 一样有问题，对未来抗审查、注重隐私的互联网来说还只是个梦想。现在，他旗下的区块链公司 TBD 创造了一个新名词 Web5，将通过放弃以区块链为中心的方法来实现无审查、以身份为中心的网络体验，从而击败现有的模式。他们所宣称的技术可能和 BT、Tor 类似。目前这个所谓的 Web5 仍处于开源开发阶段，没有正式发布日期。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Coindesk\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：生造名词的技术“创新”，并没有什么意义，就像十多年前 Web2 刚刚初露头角时就有人宣称 Web3，但是到现在连 Web3 也并没有真正得到共识和认可。更别说所谓的 Web5，我就想知道，Web4 怎么了，是 4 不吉利么。此外，其视为典范的，无论是 BT 还是 Tor，都太过于激进了。",

          "description": "Linus Torvalds 发布了用来测试的 Linux 内核 5.19 RC1，带来了一些重大变化。\n\r\n\r\n继上个月 Linux 内核 5.18 发布之后，Linus Torvalds 宣布了 Linux 内核 5.19 系列第一个候选版本。与此同时，Linux 内核 5.19 官方合并窗口关闭，这意味着除非是关键性的，否则不会再接受任何新功能。\n\r\n简单看一下 Linux 内核 5.19 的新内容，会发现 CPU、GPU、网络、存储和核心模块都有常规的更新。此外，代码清理、淘汰过时硬件和对以后芯片组的持续支持是此版本的亮点。\n\r\n在进一步介绍之前，让我们简单来看一下这些新特性。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19（RC1）的新特性\n\r\nCPU\n\r\n首先需要提及的是，Linux 内核 5.19 开始 初步支持 龙芯架构的 CPU 系列。龙芯由中国龙芯中科公司设计开发。龙芯架构的 CPU 是兼容 MIPS 架构的通用微处理器。不过虽然现在提供了支持，但是你仍不能在龙芯 CPU 上启动 Linux，因为一些代码还在审核中。希望在 5.20 版本中能够使用。\n\r\n新的 英特尔 IFS 驱动 在该版本中落地，这有助于在部署前后发现硬件问题。它能够在早期阶段检测电路层面的 CPU 错误。\n\r\n在前几个针对英特尔 CPU 的内核版本中一直在对电源管理和散热方面进行开发，这个版本 也不例外。首先，为 Raptor 和 Alder Lake 家族添加了英特尔 运行时平均功率限制Run-Time Average Power Limiting（RAPL）的支持。其次，改进了 P-state 驱动以处理频率变化，并且基于 CPU 的缩放支持被添加到被动 devfreq 中。\n\r\n虽然英特尔 CPU 主要是散热和电源管理方面的工作，但对 AMD CPU 系列来说有更多的性能更新。首先，计划在今年年底完成 ZMD Zen 4 CPU 的 基于指令的采样Instruction-Based Sampling（IBS）模块引入了更多更新。此外，此版本引入了 PerfMonV2，提供了更多性能监视能力。\n\r\n此外，该版本中移除了 a.out 支持。同样，过时的 Renesas H8/300 CPU 也被移除了。\n\r\n主要 ARM 更新\n\r\n终于，主线 Linux 内核能够 支持 ARM 多平台 了。在 Linus 的 RC1 开场白中可以看到，这是该版本中的巨大改变！从 Linux 3.7 开始，跨越了十多年的工作，这是多么漫长的过程。\n\r\n\n\r\n图形和存储升级\n\r\n存储子系统在各种流行的文件系统中都有性能提升。最主要的变化包括苹果 M1 NVMe 控制器支持和对 XFS 文件系统的更好支持。此外，Btrfs、F2FS 以及 exFAT 文件系统也有增强。\n\r\n在代码行数方面，有一个令人兴奋的指标是仅是图形驱动程序 Linux 内核 5.19 就增加了大约50 万行代码。它包括 AMD 的 RDNA、CDNA，英特尔的 Raptor Lake、DG2/Alchemist 等图形驱动更新。\n\r\n重要的网络变化\n\r\n鉴于数据传输大幅增长，对 Big TCP 的支持有助于支持数据中心 400 GBit 级别的流量。它还可以在高性能网络环境中降低延迟。\n\r\n继续改进了 多路径 TCPMulti-Path TCP（MPTCP）。此外，高通 ath11k WiFi 驱动程序在此版本中添加了网络唤醒功能。同样增加了对瑞昱的 8852ce 芯片、联发科的 T700 调制解调器以及瑞萨科技的 RZ/V2M 的支持。\n\r\n其他值得注意的功能\n\r\n首先，内核中著名的随机函数生成器（RNG）在此版本中 继续 改进。\n\r\n其次，著名的新兴的 Framework 模块化笔记本电脑获得了此版本 Chrome OS EC 驱动支持。Framework 笔记本现在可以作为一个非 Chromebook 设备利用 ChromeOS 的嵌入式控制器。\n\r\n此外，Wacom 绘画板以及其他相关设备也有众多更新。包括 对联想 Thinkpad TrackPoint II、谷歌 Whiskers Touchpad、联想 X12 TrackPoint 等设备支持的提升。\n\r\nLinux 内核 5.19 下载\n\r\n如果你想要测试并尝试该候选版本，可以在 这里 下载。\n\r\n预计在 2022 年 7 月左右最终版本发布前，将会有多个版本更迭。\n\r\n参考自：内核邮件列表\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/2022/06/linux-kernel-5-19-rc1/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：Donkey-Hao 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "GitHub 正式宣布终止 Atom 项目\n\r\nGitHub 是在 2011 年宣布 Atom，2015 年 5 月发布了 1.0 版本，并吸引了数百万开发者使用。而微软在 2015 年推出的 VS Code 也是受到了 Atom 的启发。在 2018 年微软收购 GitHub 后，Atom 成为了微软的项目。在社区对 Atom 前景的担忧之下，GitHub 承诺不会放弃 Atom。但过去几年 Atom 除了安全更新外几乎没有什么改进。而 Atom 和 VS Code 的用户数此消彼长，Stack Overflow 的 2021 年度开发者调查结果表明，仅 13% 开发者将 Atom 当做主力开发环境，而 VS Code 却高达 71%。最后，Atom 还留下了一个重要遗产，它所分拆出来的 Electron 框架被数以千计的应用广泛使用，其中包括 VS Code、Slack 和 GitHub Desktop 等等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GitHub\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实可以想到，当年社区对 GitHub 被收购的担忧并非无的放矢。可惜了 Atom，至今我还对 Atom 1.0 那时候的那个 宣传视频 记忆尤深。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIETF 正式颁布 HTTP/3 推荐标准 RFC 9114\n\r\n作为超文本传输协议的第三个大版本，它确定了 QUIC 包含的 HTTP/2 功能，并描述了如何将 HTTP/2 扩展迁移至 HTTP/3。QUIC 全称为“快速 UDP 互联网连接”，由谷歌创建并于 2013 年发布。其旨在化解 TCP 需要多次来回握手，才能建立连接并开始传输数据的短板。早在 IETF 颁布 HTTP/3 的意见征求稿前，谷歌就已经将 QUIC 支持内嵌于 Chrome 浏览器，并在谷歌的诸多服务上启用。Web 流量观测表明 HTTP/3 的流量已超过 HTTP/1.1。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我记得 HTTP/2 也不过才几年，现在都要开始普及 HTTP/3。真是风水轮流转，谁想到最主要的互联网应用 HTTP 最终会从 TCP 转向 UDP 呢。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌再次打破圆周率计算纪录，计算出百万亿位\n\r\n早在 2019 年，谷歌云服务就已经打破了圆周率的计算纪录，计算出了 31.4 万亿位。周三，谷歌云再次宣布打破了百万亿位的圆周率计算纪录。这 百万亿位圆周率 的最后 10 位是：30952 95560。谷歌云表示，其借助计算引擎服务完成了本次新挑战，用到了 N2 机器家族、虚拟网卡、100 Gbps 网络带宽，以及平衡持久磁盘等新功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：谷歌\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看似无用的圆周率计算，其实是谷歌云一次炫技的展示。有人说，任何大小的数字都能在圆周率的某个片段找到。不说百万亿位了，你能背出多少位圆周率呢？",

          "description": "编译软件在你如何运行你的系统方面给你很大的灵活性。LD_LIBRARY_PATH 变量，以及 GCC 的 -L 和 -l 选项，是这种灵活性的组成部分。\n\r\n\r\n编译软件是开发者经常做的事情，在开源世界中，一些用户甚至选择自己动手。Linux 播客 Dann Washko 称源码为“通用包格式”，因为它包含了使一个应用在任何平台上运行所需的所有组件。当然，并不是所有的源码都是为所有的系统编写的，所以它只是在目标系统的子集内是“通用”的，但问题是，源码是非常灵活的。有了开源，你可以决定代码的编译和运行方式。\n\r\n当你在编译代码时，你通常要处理多个源文件。开发人员倾向于将不同的类或模块放在不同的文件中，这样它们可以被单独维护，甚至可能被不同的项目使用。但当你编译这些文件时，许多文件会被编译成一个可执行文件。\n\r\n这通常是通过创建共享库来完成的，然后从可执行文件中动态链接回它们。这样可以通过保持模块化功能的外部性来保持可执行文件的小型化，并确保库可以独立于使用它们的应用而被更新。\n\r\n在编译过程中定位一个共享对象\n\r\n当你 用 GCC 编译 时，你通常需要在你的工作站上安装一个库，以便 GCC 能够定位到它。默认情况下，GCC 假定库在系统库路径中，例如 /lib64 和 /usr/lib64。然而，如果你要链接到一个你自己的尚未安装的库，或者你需要链接到一个没有安装在标准位置的库，那么你必须帮助 GCC 找到这些文件。\n\r\n有两个选项对于在 GCC 中寻找库很重要：\n\r\n\r\n-L（大写字母 L）在 GCC 的搜索位置上增加一个额外的库路径。\n\r\n-l（小写字母 L）设置你要链接的库的名字。\n\r\n\r\n例如，假设你写了一个叫做 libexample.so 的库，并且你想在编译你的应用 demo.c 时使用它。首先，从 demo.c 创建一个对象文件：\n\r\n$ gcc -I ./in…",

          "description": "机器学习基本上是人工智能的一个子集，它使用以前存在的数据对新数据进行预测。\n\r\n\r\n当然，现在我们所有人都知道这个道理了！这篇文章展示了如何将 Python 中开发的机器学习模型作为 Java 代码的一部分来进行预测。\n\r\n\n\r\n本文假设你熟悉基本的开发技巧并理解机器学习。我们将从训练我们的模型开始，然后在 Python 中制作一个机器学习模型。\n\r\n我以一个洪水预测模型为例。首先，导入以下库：\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\n\r\n当我们成功地导入了这些库，我们就需要输入数据集，如下面的代码所示。为了预测洪水，我使用的是河流水位数据集。\n\r\nfrom google.colab import files\r\nuploaded = files.upload()\r\nfor fn in uploaded.keys(): \r\n    print('User uploaded file \"{name}\" with length {length} bytes'.format(name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))\r\n\n\r\n如果没有选择文件的话，选择上传的文件。\n\r\n只有在当前浏览器会话中执行了该单元格时，上传部件才可用。请重新运行此单元，上传文件 Hoppers Crossing-Hourly-River-Level.csv，大小 2207036 字节。\n\r\n完成后，我们就可以使用 sklearn 库来训练我们的模型。为此，我们首先需要导入该库和算法模型，如图 1 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\nregressor = LinearRegression()\r\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\n\r\n完成后，我们就训练好了我们的模型，现在可以进行预测了，如图 2 所示。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Java 中使用 ML 模型\n\r\n我们现在需要做的是把 ML 模型转换成一个可以被 Java 程序使用的模型。有一个叫做 sklearn2pmml 的库可以帮助我们做到这一点：\n\r\n# Install the library\r\npip install sklearn2pmml\r\n\n\r\n库安装完毕后，我们就可以转换我们已经训练好的模型，如下图所示：\n\r\nsklearn2pmml(pipeline, ‘model.pmml’, with_repr = True)\r\n\n\r\n这就完成了！我们现在可以在我们的 Java 代码中使用生成的 model.pmml 文件来进行预测。请试一试吧！\n\r\n（LCTT 译注：Java 中有第三方库 jpmml/jpmml-evaluator，它能帮助你使用生成的 model.pmml 进行预测。）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/05/using-a-machine-learning-model-to-make-predictions/\n\r\n作者：Jishnu Saurav Mittapalli 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这次我买了一箱五谷道场“非油炸”方便面，写一写非油炸泡面。\n\n在我前几篇关于泡面的文章中，每每写到非油炸泡面，我总是忍不住揶揄几句，作为一个油炸泡面的忠实拥趸，我不喜欢非油炸泡面的原因有很多，比如大部分非油炸面饼无法干吃，只能泡熟再吃；即使泡熟，非油炸泡面在口感上也不及油炸泡面，这是大多数非油炸面饼与生俱来的劣势；最重要的是，非油炸泡面因为面饼的干燥工艺成本高，价格往往更贵。以五谷道场泡面为例，在拼多多上，每盒价格在6.5元左右，而合味道和汤达人泡面的价格每盒不超过5元，统一和康师傅的泡面更是3元不到，油炸泡面显然更具性价比。\n非油炸泡面优点是更加健康，与油炸面饼相比，非油炸泡面的干燥工艺不经过油炸，面饼油脂含量更低，但二者差多少呢？我根据泡面的“营养成分表”，特意做了记录。\n在非油炸泡面中，以我购买的四包五谷道场泡面汤面为例（拌面因为酱料等原因，脂肪含量高于汤面），他们的脂肪含量分别为：酸笋肥牛面，5.0g/100g；剁椒鱼头面，6.8g/100g；酸汤老鸭面，6.8g/100g；豉汁辣排面，6.8g/100g。以一个简单粗暴的方式取平均值，每百克脂肪含量大概是6.35g/100g。\n而油炸泡面的脂肪含量以康师傅和统一经典的几款泡面为例，康师傅红烧牛肉面，25.5g/100g；香辣牛肉面，27.1g/100g；藤椒牛肉面，25.3g/100g。统一香辣牛肉面，22.9g/100g；红烧牛肉面，22.8g/100g；泡椒牛肉面，21.9g/100g。取平均值为24.25g/100g。\n每百克非油炸泡面的脂肪含量要比油炸泡面低17.9g，而一包袋装泡面重量刚好在100g左右，因而每包非油炸泡面的脂肪含量要比油炸泡面少17.9g，或者说，油炸泡面的脂肪含量是非油炸泡面的四倍。\n\n根据中国营养学会发布的我国居民膳食营养素推荐摄入量(RNI)，每天推荐摄入能量大约为8400kJ，包…",

          "description": "这是一张我一直珍藏在手机里的照片，2017 年，少数派很荣幸的被邀请到美国现场参见 WWDC 大会，并参与了 Apple 设计奖的颁奖和报道，作为一个名不见经传的小媒体来说确实难得，也算是对我们前五年坚持推荐优质付费应用的一个小小认可。\n\n从这一年开始，一张图看懂 WWDC 就成了我们的招牌菜，用最简洁、最漂亮的设计，诠释大会关键信息，别小看这一张图，都是在半夜三点到六点之间做完的，通常都要两三个同事一起熬通宵，我虽然不参与设计，也会尽量陪着，做一些社交传播工作。\n也就是这一次，我才了解到苹果设计奖的一些标准关键词：Usability（易用性）、Design（设计）、Innovation （创新），Technology（技术应用）。而我们在 2014 年，就基于用户的角度，总结了少数派报道和推荐产品的四个标准关键词：「原创，优美，实用，有趣」，并把它们标注在网站的页脚。\n\n我没想到两个标准会有这么高的重合度，虽然看起来非常的巧合，但实际上，这是平台方希望保持「用户角度」的相同初心。这几个字说起来简单，但面对商业世界就非常的不容易。因为要坚持这样的推荐报道原则，我们放弃了很多广告投放的机会，商业化进展缓慢，终于在用完第一笔投资之后，进入严重的经营困难，不得不大幅收缩团队，转型拓展。而这个痛苦阶段，就在我们第一次受邀参加 WWDC 大会的一个月之后。\n现实就是如此，台前的辉煌不一定被看到，但幕后的痛苦你一个也躲不掉。\n\n从 2017 到 2019 年，少数派连续三次被邀请到美国现场报道 WWDC，随着经验丰富，我们也做了更多的准备。2019 年现场采访了很多开发者，录制了一些现场视频，那一年，我们刚刚建立视频内容小组，开始拓展一些新的形式。虽然拍摄和剪辑比较稚嫩，但内容还算是干货满满。\n随后两年，疫情来了，WWDC 也都改成了线上录播，虽然缺少了线下的仪式感，但我们还是保持着熬夜报道和制作一图流的习惯。对于我这个四十出头的中年人来说，熬一次夜还是挺伤身的，但这既是工作，也是爱好，痛并快乐着。\n近两年，随着智能手机销量的下降，国产品牌的追赶，WWDC 的关注度似乎也在减退，因为用户希望看到更多惊喜，而现实是硬件和应用创新都进入了瓶颈期。这次 WWDC 2022，苹果生态的价值开始被展现出来，四个大的 OS 都基本完善了，开始进行相互打通，比如 iPhone 和 Mac 电脑的相机协同，比如 macOS 的台前调度被整合到 iPadOS，还有深度调用车机信息的全新 CarPlay，这里不是简单的把设备捏在一块，而是基于用户的场景需求，提供最佳的组合方案，多年构建的生态壁垒又一次拉开了苹果与其他对手的距离。\n但回想一下，苹果这个生态是怎么来的呢？首先你不能跟风，而是要站在用户的角度，去做未来的布局；其次你不能贪婪，要放弃短期利益，去构建长期的用户信任；最后你不能偷懒，要保证每一个产品和服务的体验，不断累加产品力。除了这些基础的工作，还要应对开发者关系、投资者收益、供应链管理等一系列的考验，所以具有壁垒的生态不是喊出来的，是一步一步做出来的。\n\n一转眼，五年又过去了，很庆幸少数派还在，并且建立了基础的商业闭环，而苹果已经成为了全球最具价值的公司，我们也又一次参与了 WWDC 和苹果设计奖的采访报道。这五年里，很多外部事物都变了，但更多底层的东西并没有变。",

          "description": "这是一篇万字长文，主要涉及以下三个部分：\n第一部分：理解对方。相较于《非暴力沟通》中的观察、行动、感受、请求等步骤的目的是通过用非暴力的表达方式让对方理解自己，即将介绍的「知觉检核」技巧更加倾向于带着一种开放的态度尝试去理解对方；第二部分：管理情绪。情绪看似是外力作用的结果，其实是知觉产生的想法所导致的结果；第三部分：展现自我。虽然自我的概念在很大程度上是由天性决定的，但在沟通的过程中可以被塑造，「自我袒露」的深度和广度决定着一段关系的亲密程度。\n先对上篇文章《沟通的艺术｜学校错过的课程，现在补上也不晚》中提到的沟通的定义做个简单回顾：\n\n人际沟通是一个交流的过程，其参与者们处于不同但又有所重叠的背景下，经由交换信息来创造价值和建立关系，过程中会受到外在、生理和心理的噪音干扰。\n\n「不同背景」是沟通中客观存在的前提条件，「交换信息」是在沟通的过程中我们主动进行的行为，而「创造价值和建立关系」是我们「交换信息」的目的，或者是沟通这个行为产生的结果。上篇文章详细介绍了沟通的定义，和在「交换信息」时起到先导作用的「倾听」的技巧和注意事项。本篇文章的重点则是「交换信息」时本身的动作，了解人们理解信息的一般过程，以及「噪音干扰」会对「创造价值和关系」造成什么影响。\n理想中的沟通\n\n当我们倾听对方说话时，如果能意识到双方有着不同的背景，就可以明白为什么对方的某些行为让自己觉得无法理喻：因为不同的「教育/生活背景」差异会导致两人的知觉产生巨大的偏差。通过使用「知觉检核」技巧可以准确地理解对方；如果能意识到沟通会受到噪音干扰，我们就可以理解为什么在情绪上头时进行的沟通往往会造成让人后悔莫及的结果，因为我们的大脑会受到愤怒等「生理噪音」的干扰从而变的不那么理智。通过了解正确的「情绪管理」技巧能够帮助我们识别自己和对方的情绪并加以控制。\n当我们尝试说服对方时，如果能意识到沟通会受噪音干扰，就可…",

Kindle 停止运行的重要时间节点\nKindle 对于我们的影响主要是在两个时间点：2023 年 6 月 23 日和 2024 年 6 月 40 日。\n\n在 2023 年的 6 月 23 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 商店当中购买我们喜欢的图书（还有一年时间缓冲）。\n在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日前，我们依然可以在 Kindle 当中下载我们已经购买好的图书。\n在 2024 年的 6 月 30 日之后，我们只能通过 Kindle 数据线连接电脑的方式来下载图书到 Kindle 当中阅读。\n\n所以从短期来看，我们依然可以继续使用 Kindle 愉快的读书而没有丝毫的影响。但长期来看，如果你更喜欢线上随时选购的方案，那迁移到其他平台是必然的选择。\n2.

Regularly $179.99, you can currently buy it from Best Buy, B&H Photo, and Sonos for just $143.20, the speaker’s best price to date. That’s less than the typical cost of the cheaper Sonos Roam SL, which is essentially the same speaker but without the built-in microphone.\nThe pint-sized, portable speaker sounds great and comes equipped with a number of useful features, including support for Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple’s AirPlay 2.
