We mostly come across this situation when a React component needs to return multiple elements.\nThe traditional approach has been to wrap them in a div element because a React component can return only one element. This behavior results in useless additional markup and also makes the DOM tree heavy with additional layers of divs.\nThe traditional solution to render 3 child components in a single component would have been:\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n…",

This collection of email-based challenges including (\"Start Coding\", \"Code More\", \"Write More\", and \"Get a Job\") existed long before DEV and CodeNewbie joined forces, but together, we updated it and added in additional support options and a central hub on CodeNewbie Community. Those who participated benefitted from structure, public accountability, inspiration, and ample learning opportunities to reach their goals.\nCodeNewbie Challenge for 2022 (#CNC2022).\n\n\n\n#CNC2022 returns on January 31st. This time, we're making a few changes, including:\nA pre-registration, cohort-based model that allows you to stay in tighter communication with others participating in your chosen challenge\nUpdated resources\nA brand new \"Learn in Public\" challenge that will give you the guidance you need to turn your technical learning journey into a tool for others\nIf you want to make a change in your career or coding journey, we highly encourage you to sign up for Cohort 1 of #CNC2022. \nLearn more, pick your challenge, and sign up for Cohort 1 here by January 30th. The challenge officially kicks off on January 31st, 2022. \nCheers to starting to code, coding more, writing more, getting a job, and learning in public with the CodeNewbie Challenge in 2022 ⭐️",

This is probably the most common way of creating an Array.\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\n\nUsing the ES6 notation you can create a copy of another array. Specially useful in functional programming to avoid side effects (i.e. modifying the original array).\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nconst copyOfNumbers = [...numbers];\n\n// You can also join 2 arrays into one:\nconst numbersTwice = [...numbers, ...numbers];\n// This will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]\n\nJavaScript defines an Array constructor that allows you to specify the length of the array. This method is useful if you know how large your array is going to be. Note that the constructor will create an array where all the elements are empty (not undefined).\nconst emptyArray = new Array(5);\n\nconsole.log(emptyArray);\n// [ <5 empty items> ]\n\nconsole.log(emptyArray.length);\n// 5\n\nThis method accepts an iterator (which can be another array or a set) and creates a new array with the same elements.\nconst copiedArray = Array.from([1, 2, 3]);\n\nThis method accepts an unlimited number of parameters that will be used as elements of the new constructed array.\nconst paramsArray = Array.of('a', 'b', 'c');",

(I guess that's the great part of always working in other project teams).\nLet me describe today in more detail 🤓\nDaily Scrum Meeting\nI had been assigned a mentor 🥰 with whom I set up my laptop. By the way, this is an additional laptop, there is an extra laptop for each project for security reasons. I was given all the access to the tools they use, Microsoft Teams, GitLab, etc.\nJira\nJira, an agile management tool, with Scrum board (there are also other boards like Kanban). There all current issues are entered in the Scrum Backlog, active ones were assigned to a Dev, in the Product Backlog you can find the whole list of all issues. Jira is a very clear and good tool to work effectively as a Scrum team.\nAs you can see, Scrum is very present, so I recommend you to get familiar with the framework before your first job. It will definitely come across well in the interview if you have already dealt with it. \nJenkins\nCMD Shortcuts\nGitLens\nNVM\nnvm use 16.13.1.\nToday was great. 🥳 I learned so many new things without writing a single line of code. I'm really looking forward to finally getting started with my issue. \n\nThanks for your reading and time. I really appreciate it!",

I’m using shallow cloning to speed up things since the entire commit history is not needed.\n# grab only the repo state at the v1.9.2 tag\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch v1.9.2 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git\n\nThen, go into the directory and run the cargo-install-all.sh script.\ncd solana\n./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .\necho \"export PATH=$PWD/bin:\\$PATH\" >> ~/.zshrc\n\n\nThis will take a while, but after it is finished, you can verify if the installation is successful with:\nsolana --version\n\nThere used to be an issue with solana-test-validator on M1 Macs, but the problem has been solved. You can try to spin it up to make sure it works.\n\nAnchor is the recommended framework for Solana programs.\nNote that Anchor uses Yarn v1 to manage Javascript dependencies in your project, so make sure you already have it installed on your computer.\nSince there’s no official binary available for the M1 architecture, we’ll also need to build from source:\ncargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.19.0 anchor-cli --locked\n\nThen, you can verify if the installation is successful with:\nanchor --version\n\n\nAnd that’s it.

My other project that I've been working on, the Backend Server, has 14 stars, 9 forks, and nearly 10 outside contributors. That might not sound like a lot, but both of these projects are only about a week old.\nSo, how did I do it?\nThe most important thing has been issues, which I talked about here. But, the second most important thing has been designing a great readme. \nA good readme is the difference between someone staring your project and someone ignoring it. If you have badges, easily understandable features, and lots of images, you have a star worthy repository. \nFirst, you need to have badges. If you don't know what a badge is, it's the little image that says how many stars, downloads, etc. a project has. These are also known as shields, and you can get them from this website. If you have a ton of them and they all say good things, it increases the confidence that someone has in your project. \nSecondly, you need easily understandable features. If you look at my newest repository, eaf-linter, you will see that all of the features have a simple headline and they link to a new page. This is very important. If your feature can link to a more in depth description of the feature, it will increase the confidence that the possible contributor has in your project. \nFinally, images are super important. In my backend server, I have a ton of really eye-catching images. These images increase the likelihood that someone will keep looking through your readme, and the longer that the person stays on your page, the more likely they are to star your repository. \nThere will be more tips like this coming tomorrow and the day after, so if you liked hearing this, make sure to follow me, so you can see more tips as they come out.\nAlso, our open-source, non-profit is hiring right now if you're interested.

The command  symfony console  debug:autowiring doctrine shows all doctrine services available.\nType-hint an argument $em to EntityManagerInterface, create an Object (ex $job), set all its properties then call persist and flush methods.\n\nCalling persist() method tells Doctrine that we want to save the object, no query is executed yet. We call this method as many time as objects that we have, once we call flush() method, Doctrine execute the queries needed to insert to database.\nWe can check if data has been inserted with : symfony console doctrine:query:sql 'select * from job'\n\nGetting data(objects) from db is even easier, one way to do that is by using JobRepository $jobRepo as an argument in our method. \n\nThe repository class offers many helper methods to get our data from db like : findBy, findOneBy...

I made an issue for it already, but I need to start working on it. And, that's where my question lies. \nI can either build the system to detect the duplications based on plain text. This is how most systems work because it is the simpler of the two options. But, it is also the most failure prone. For instance, this system would fail if there was the same exact code in two places, but there was a comment in the middle of one of them- it would not register as a duplicate.  \nAlternatively, I can use an abstract syntax tree to detect the duplications. But, theres another problem there- what is the most-lightweight and all-around-best javascript parser out there? I'm planning on using the babel parser but I'm already running into a problem because it doesn't parse the comments in a way I would like. \nSo, if you have an opinion on what I should do, please leave a comment below. Also, please star the project and contribute if you have time. If you can, that would be amazing, and I thank you so much!",

It triggers a notification to the runner I specified, and then it processes the series of tasks I specified.\nWhich involves building and deploying.\nThis is a legacy React project, and had long been updated. After upgrading the packages I git committed. Build built successfully but deployment failed. With the following error:\n\nI read through the error to understand what the problem really was, and I found it:\nModule.createRequire is not a function\n\nThat was the only error that was reasonably clear indeed and meant something.\nSo I Googled it, and I found out that it's an issue with Create React App, it's always on or looking for the latest, which means the Node engine version has to always be the latest and that includes my npm version, else some things might break.\nSo in essence whatever machine running that project has to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6\nMy GitLab-ci.yml contains a Docker image with a node version of 10.15.3, so there is a need to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nimage: giona69/node-10.15.3-aws-eb\n\nAnd I temporarily replaced the docker image with the latest node.\n\n\n\n\nimage: node:14.18.2\n\nRebuilt Node-Sass\nI added \nnpm rebuild node-sass \nAnd Voila!!

If you are unaware, I would highly suggest you to start from the part_1 ( of the 6 series post).\nSo the first question that can strike you is why we need a custom directive when Angular already provided us with 6 amazing directives. The simple reason is there can be multiple scenarios where the exact requirements are not met using the built-in directives. In those cases we need to write our own logic to meet the requirement and custom directives comes to the rescue.\nNow, lets see how we can create our own custom directive.\nng generate directive <directive-name>\nng g d <directive-name>\nLets create a simple directive which when applied to an el…",

We use our phones for almost every day. We used to shop at malls, line up at banks, and plan our trips at agencies. But now, we can do all these things in our homes using smartphones. All of this is made possible by a high-level programming language called Java.\nJava is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) used on the Internet. Java is a high-level language that is also easy to read and understand. Using it, developers can write once and run anywhere, which means that compiled Java code runs on all Java-compatible platforms without the need to recompile.\nJames Gosling and Sun Microsystems invented the Java programming language in 1991.

Of course I knew they were important before - everybody does - but it's so easy to just push it aside and focus on more exciting code, or write some perfunctory tests that don't really, well, test anything. Eventually, however, slacking off on testing comes back to bite you; for me, luckily, it did when things were only getting started, but the point was clear - writing good tests is a top priority.\nFor Agrippa, however, writing good tests is far from trivial - it's a CLI for generating React components based on a project's environment (dependencies, existence of config files, etc.), as well as an optional .agripparc.json config. In other words, a lot of its work is reading & parsing comm…",

Object-oriented programming makes our code readable, reusable, modular, and is generally pretty simple paradigm to get our heads around.\nIn Ruby, everything is an object. We generally divide up our code into Classes and Instances, so this isn't an unfamiliar concept.

In an attempt to eliminate this and the numerous null errors that occur while building/debugging your app, the great Flutter and Dart team introduced Null Safety.\nIn simple terms, Null Safety allows the dart analyser to detect possible null errors pre-compilation, that is, before you even run your app. It ensures proper notifications of possible null data that could break your app while running.\nThis article is for you, if\nYou understand the basics of data types in Dart.\nYou know a bit about classes, objects, i.e. the basics o…",

So we as human beings fear the unknown, but a good interview should be more like a conversation instead of a police interrogation.\nInterviewers have asked me if I know S.O.L.I.D. principles, unit testing in deep and even I've been asked to use graph theory to solve a problem. When I got the job, there is a high dependency on a specific dll that do a lot of different things (This by it's own violates all SOLID principles), I never used anything they asked me, so what's the need to make the technical interview unnecessarily complex and tedious?. When I am interviewing a candidate I try to make a conversation like: Tell me about your experience, the latest project you are working on, what technology you like the most, and why. I guess that they are trying to emulate top-tech companies like GAFAM, what I have heard about these companies is that the technical interviews are very focused on data structures and problem-solving (not sure if they are used in daily work).\nMy point is: if your company focuses on a specific product, ask what you're looking for, ask for the technologies you are currently using, please stop doing stupidly complex technical tests unless your company is currently using these techniques to solve complex problems.\nAnd as always, happy coding!.",

MicroPython is an incredible tool for rapidly prototyping and iterating on hardware projects. It's similar to Arduino but instead of using C++, which you have to re-compile each time you make a code change, it runs on the Python interpreter which allows you to run code changes immediately. The quick feedback cycle enabled by MicroPython will, I believe, power the future of embedded development.\nWhat is the \"hello world\" of embedded software? Why, blinking an LED, of course! In this first tutorial, we'll get you acquainted with the fundamentals of MicroPython and more importantly, the online simulator we'll be using for all the tutorials.

This project also focuses heavily on flexbox, so if you want to get some practice with that then this is the perfect tutorial!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUBhdvK31A \nIn this first part, I'm showing you how to set up the html, and the styling for the mobile version of the website. In the second part I am going to show you how to make the page fully responsive and look good on desktop.\nI have made a git repository that you can clone to follow along the tutorial (which I recommend)\n\nhttps://github.com/SebCodesTheWeb/disneyclone\nHello! My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.\nI'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch). I started this project to get some practice with css flexbox.\nBy the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself and making tutorials on my \nYouTube-channel .\nIt would be awesome if you would follow along me on my journey and learn with me. You can follow my  blog  and subscribe to my  YouTube channel. And if you liked the YouTube video then it would really make my day if you left a comment or liked this post.\n\nKeep Coding.",

The purpose of the OSI model is to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software. OSI has a stack of seven layers within the model and the layers are used to help user identify what is happening within a networking system.\nWhat is OSI layer?\n\n\nThe OSI layer are typically described from the top layer down. With the help of layering we decompose the problem of building a network into manageable components (layers), these layers help with modular design and easy troubleshooting.

          "description": "Sometime in JavaScript we need a function that executes only once and never again. Basically a function that disappears right after its called once. How can we achieve this? for example we could do this:\nconst func1 = function(){\n             console.log('this function will never run again!`)\n                }\n func1();\n\nBut we definitely can call this func1() again if we want. This is NOT what we want to do. We want to execute a function immediately without having to save it somewhere.\nfunction(){\nconsole.log('This function will never run again')\n}\n\nif we run this, we would get an error function statements require a function name an that's because JavaScript expects a function statement, but we simply start a new line of code with the function keyword.\nHere we can still trick JavaScript into thinking that this is just an expression. We do that by simply wrapping all of this into GROUPING OPERATOR().\n(function(){\n   console.log('This is will never run again!')\n});\n\nso we basically transform the previous statement into an expression. But the function didn't execute yet. To execute the function we need to call it like this (adding '()' next to it, like we do with regular function call).\n(function(){\n   console.log('This is will never run again!')\n})();\n\nSo we create a function expression and we immediately call it. which is why this pattern is called Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE).\nThe same would also work for an arrow function this way.\n(() => console.log('This function will never run again!'))();\n\nThis will also never run again.\nso this is not really a feature, of the JavaScript.\nit's more of a pattern, that some developers come up with and it is widely used.\nThis design pattern is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.\nSelf-Executing -> it executes the moment it is created.\nAnonymous -> it has no name and is not stored variable.",

Since true is assigned to the directive ngIf the p tag is visible.\nmyAge variable value to say 17 so that the above condition is false but the second line of code \n<p *ngIf=\"myAge < 18\">I am a CHILD</p> returns true.\nNow if you open the browser you will see that the output changes.\np tag is not shown/ hidden while the second p tag is shown which was hidden when the model value was 18.\n\n  checkAge() {\n    if (this.myAge >= 18) {\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\nand in html template file you can call the function inside ngIf like below -\n<p *ngIf=\"checkAge()\">I am an Adult!</p>\n\nNote\nAny values like false, null, undefined, empty string when assigned to ngIf will result in hiding the element.\nHope you enjoyed the post.\nCheers!!!\nHappy Coding",

What is fascinating is that planning and creating a design template is better as it allows you to check which font and colors suit your website and style, because it's not easy to change theme of whole website once it's somewhat or maybe completely built as compare to UI creation tools.\n\nUsing such tools like FIGMA and Adobe XD allows us to quickly do those changes and finalize the design, all then is left to implement them in real-time website.\n*1. Icons *\nhttps://www.flaticon.com/ that I personally use when it comes to icons and small vectors to aid website looks.\n\n2. Theme and colors\nhttps://flatuicolors.com/ as it provides best colors and combos that are so perfect when actually implemented. It's easy and free to use :)\n\n3. Images\nhttps://unsplash.com/ although you might already know about it. But something that you might not be knowing is that they also provide users with an API that provide aesthetic images by artists for you to implement in your source code.\n\n4. Fonts. YES! please\nhttps://fonts.google.com/ or https://fontawesome.com/ (font awesome provides icons as well).\n\nHope all this was useful to you and I hope you'll apply these in your projects so they would look even more attractive.\nTry finding the best resources that suits and makes you paragraphs sexier!",

          "description": "The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript. Prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default. This allows you to define properties on objects that can be accessed via the object’s instances.\nlet us look at an example\n\nlet person = {};\n\nperson.name = \"David\";\nperson.age = 45;\n\nperson.eat = function() {\nconsole.log(`person is eating`);\n}\n\nHere we are creating new instances for the object. If you console.log this object you won’t see any methods, but you can use methods like set or get for the object prototype.\n\nWhen you use map, JavaScript looks for map in the object itself. If map is not found, JavaScript will try to look for a Prototype. If JavaScript finds a prototype, it continues to search for map in that prototype.\nSo the correct definition for Prototype is: An object that instances can access when they’re trying to look for a property.\nWhen a property is accessed in javascript, javascript checks to see if the property is available inside the object. If yes, JavaScript uses the property straight away.  If the property is not inside the object, JavaScript checks if there’s a Prototype available. If there is a Prototype, repeat Step 1 (and check if the property is inside the prototype). If there are no more Prototypes left, and JavaScript cannot find the property, it does the following:\nReturns undefined (if you tried to access a property).\nThrows an error (if you tried to call a method).",

You can't do everything. Or at least not efficiently in time. And time is one of the most valuable resources you have. That's why many founders will tell you to find a co-founder for your idea. In most cases a mix of technical and sales based skillset would be very helpful. \nSince I work as a developer, it seems easy to find someone else with a technical background. And that's how I met your... my co-founder.\nThere probably are a ton of todo apps out there. And thats okay. Everyone has its own preferences and tastes when choosing a new product.

          "description": "Given how competitive University admissions are and how often the average University student changes majors due to career confusion, getting a high school internship is more valuable than ever before. However, pre-university work experience is difficult to come by and oftentimes opportunities are given to students who have strong networks (either through a parent or their school). Today, there is no platform through which high school students all over the country can find an internship on their own. We aim to build a platform that supports high schoolers attending public schools and empowers businesses in hiring bright students. Interniac fills the gap in our education system by simplifying the process for employers to start internship programs and source candidates who are eager to gain valuable out-of-the-classroom work experience. \nOur mission is to bring you opportunities, whether that be an internship or a chance to speak to professionals in the field you are interested in. We strive to help you build your future.

Data scientists need programming languages in order to have the necessary tools for their job. In this blog post, we will talk about the best programming languages for data science and why they are so important!\nR Language\nPython\nC++\nJava\nWolfram Language\nR, Python, SQL, C++, Java, and Wolfram Language. Each of these languages has unique benefits that make them popular among data scientists. For example, R is widely adopted due to its ability to be easily understood by those who are not experts in the field and Python is popular due to its readability and a large number of libraries. C++ has become very common in the field since it was designed for systems-level processing which makes it a great fit for those working on operating system kernels such as Linux, Java became extremely **popular with data scientists after big data came into existence along with having many useful libraries available for data science tasks and **Wolfram Language is being adopted by some due to its symbolic computation abilities and high-performance libraries. Each of these languages has something unique to offer making them a great choice for those working in the field of data science.\nData science is a high-demand field and knowing which programming languages data scientists should know can make or break their careers. If you want to be a successful data scientist, it’s important that you have the right skillset. We recommend learning Python for beginners as well as Java for more advanced work with computer code.

This weekend, I had some freetime from school & got to work!\nThis library supports TypeScript, along with server-side rendering (Next.js & Remix)\nWant a demo? I setup a quick demo website to help you tweak & experiment around with values!\nTo download the library, head over to your terminal:\nyarn add custom-pointer-react\n\nNext, import the cursor component into your file & customise it! Don't forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.\nimport { Cursor } from 'custom-pointer-react'\n...\nconst Cursor = () => {\n  return (\n    ...\n    <Cursor {...passParametersToCustomise} />\n    ...\n  )\n}\n...\nexport default App\n\nAll parameters are optional, & here's a list of the different parameters which you can customise: \n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\ncolor\nThe background colour of the cursor\n#000000\n\n\nshowRing\nControls whether to show the ring around the cursor\ntrue\n\n\nringSize\nControls the size of the ring around the cursor\n50px\n\n\ncursorSize\nControls the size of the cursor\n10px\n\n\nringBorder\nControls the width of the ring's border\n2px\n\n\n\nNeed help finding the right parameters? Check out the demo website!\nNow, go into your app & import the MouseContext provider.\nimport { MouseContextProvider } from 'custom-pointer-react'\n...\nReactDOM.render(\n  <MouseContextProvider>\n    <App />\n  </MouseContextProvider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n...\n\nYour custom cursor should be good to go!",

Every painting sold is 100% unique - you're in full control of your art.\nI combined some pretty cutting edge ML with a proprietary post-processing pipeline to deliver probably the highest quality art of this kind (in my opinion, though of course I'm biased).\nA lot of people have called it unsettling & kind of scary, which I agree with!

Instead of collecting data on a single server, the data remains private on their servers and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. The goal of federate learning is for each participant to benefit from a larger pool of data than their own, resulting in increased ML performance, while respecting data ownership and privacy.\nHorizontal federated learning is introduced in the scenarios that data sets share the same feature space but different in samples.

There are three storage modes: public-cloud — when infrastructure is hosted by third-party data centers, private-cloud — within the companies network, and hybrid — a mixed approach.\nThe popularity of SaaS has been growing for thirty years. It appeared within the 70-is because computers were huge and very expensive, and many companies couldn't afford to possess one.

People from discord recommended using XAMPP, so I'll be sticking with it for now. Having installed it, everything left is understanding how it works.",

In the blog, I mentioned I would write a progress blog on Monday, so here I am!\nFor the last assignment(we call Release) of my open source course, I've decided to contribute to an open source project which is my college's C language course notes. The issue I'm working on is about \"Standardize frontmatter across all pages\". When we contributed to the project in our last Release, we added slug as one of the properties for frontmatter. However, it made links broken since internal links use page names vs. slugs, so my professor told me to review some of the PRs if they included it.\nI've done the following for the standardization of Frontmatter:\nAdded id, title, sidebar_position, and description for all markdown pages\nEach property of frontmatter was unified in order\nUnified format of description\nShortened description to maximum 160 characters (Reason: description becomes the <meta name=\"description\" content=\"...\"/> inside the <head>tag, and Google generally truncates snippets to ~155-160 characters)\nAdded \"Standardize frontmatter\" to the CONTRIBUTING.md file\nPR Link: https://github.com/Seneca-ICTOER/IPC144/pull/143\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Getting reviews and change requests\n\n\nOne of my classmates reviewed my changes, and he asked me to reinsert slug in the root of the file, and also add a step in the Workflow in Contributing.md. Also, one of the repo's owners requested to change some descriptions in the frontmatter. When I worked on Standardizing frontmatter, the description was hard since I'm familiar with the course notes, but I wasn't very good at C language.\nThe goal for this Release is for my PR to get merged by this Friday. However, I didn't change any codes in this contribution. I still need to make more PRs for my previous Releases. It would be a lot of things to do in my final exams week. I will try my best and put lots of effort into all of these Releases.",

You can remove unused dependencies using go mod tidy and your go.mod will only include all used imports. \nWhen you clone a Go project from github, for example, you'll want to run go get to install all of the dependencies declared in the go.mod file. If you're coming from a background in web development, this is similar to how you run npm install to install all of the dependencies declared in your package.json file. \nYou may see some dependencies in your go.mod file that are indirect (denoted by // indirect). This means that one of your dependencies doesn't have its own go.mod file, so, the dependencies that it imports are included in your project's go.mod file. \nFor example:\ngithub.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc/v2, but it doesn't have a go.mod file and it uses functions from github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc.

          "description": "Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration available in settings has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.\nA couple of years ago we developed an integration that would allow folks to automatically use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. \nThe specialized integration is going away, but there are a lot of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago @vjnvisakh\n posted this:\nDev.to as a headless CMS\nVisakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read\n#react\n        #javascript\n        #webdev\n        #opensource\n      \nThis was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.\nYou've probably noticed several deprecations lately. It's all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, everything we do is open source via Forem and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.",

          "description": "来自 Matrix 机器人\n在疫情的反复洗礼下，2021 似乎并没有我们盼望的那么顺利。我们逐渐明白，与其说「明天会更好」，其实不如多关注当下的自己。这两年数字时代似乎一直在向各种「明天」呼啸飞奔——远程工作、虚拟交流、视频时代、人人主播，但在喧嚣过后，真正重要的唯有少数派们内心的追求和热爱。\n和往年一样，在这次的 少数派 2021 年度盘点活动 中，我们也请到了几位你可能认识或值得你认识一下的「少数派」，和他们聊一聊过去这一年的工作与生活。\n\n介绍一下你自己\n你好吗！新年快乐！我是熊小默，一个视频创作者和短片导演。\n\n我以前做过杂志主编，呆过互联网公司，发过当艺术家的梦，但目前占据我生活最大块的是旅行和拍摄。我对设计史和摄影史很感兴趣，收藏珍版唱片和机械钟表，我的视频也太多围绕设计、艺术和流行文化展开。\n为什么喜欢机械表、怎么想到要做一档关于机械表的视频栏目？\n现在很多人把表看作是展现身份的奢侈品，一种阶层符号。但作为一个从初中开始就迷恋钟表的人，我把它看作机械奇迹。时间本身是不可客观度量的，但钟表能把它等块切分，靠的只是齿轮咬合。而在我们人类历史的很长一段时间里，报时的权力属于国王或教会，现代钟表则是把这种权力交还给普通人。\n\n我有一档视频栏目叫《HAND ON》，就是希望以诗歌化的语言，唯美的微观画面，来和大家分享在设计或历史意义上有值得一提之处的腕表。\n \n2021 年让你印象深刻的腕表或相关品牌？\n有几块风格迥异的腕表我很喜欢：\nHUBLOT 和村上隆的新一代合作款。\n\nOMEGA 的多用途计时器超霸 Chronoscope 腕表。\n\n宝珀的 5008D 无辐射版五十噚。\n\n希望通过《拍照的人》系列传达什么样的观点或者思考？\n《拍照的人》这组短片是想去纪录全国各地在拍照的年轻人，他们对于摄影有全新的理解，也把它用作不同于以往的表达手段。\n  \n在系列短片里，我很有意地避开「摄影师」这三个字，因为我不想把拍照这件事塑造成为职业化的，需要特殊训练的，有天赋才艺的人才能做的事。我希望展现拍照这个动作里直觉、本能、生活化的特质。\n\n拍照是每个现代年轻人命中注定的行为，只不过我希望这组短片能给大家一些寻找表达出口的启发。另外，这组短片也是希望密切地和地理发生关系的，能展现主人公和他们的家乡的关联。我们去了黔南、辽西、山西、潮汕地区、黑龙江，就是为了分享这种地理的差异性如何启发拍照。\n推荐 3 位你最喜欢的视频博主？\n@cbvivi、@苏兆阳Sudo、@flypig。\n从眼镜到腕表再到数码产品，你推荐过很多精美有趣的物件，你平时出门会带或者常用哪些装备？\n表我肯定会戴，我可以做到连续七周每天换表不重样。\n照相机我一般也会带，有拍摄工作时带 FX3，没有工作时我会带徕卡（但是是胶卷相机，而不是那台花了我很多钱的 M10-R black paint，非常让人失望的粗制滥造产品，买来基本没用）。还有润唇膏和耳塞，我基本时时刻刻在听点有的没的。\n\n推荐 3 样你的年度好物，并简单说说理由。\nDJI 新出的麦克风，非常好用，我们现在录播客已经全面改用这款无线麦了。\n\n永璞咖啡的榛果味胶囊，我的年度最大发现，便宜好喝香，泡起来很简单。\nAstell & Kern 的蓝牙音箱 Acro BE100，很美、很动听，还不贵。\n\n用一个词概括你的 2021 年，为什么？\n半空半满。\n我今年做了很多让自己骄傲的项目，但是呢，又感觉它们其实本来也在我能力之内，并没有太多进步。\n对于新的一年有哪些期待？\n希望2022可以学到、看到全新的东西。增加生命体验。\n> 少数派 2021 年度活动页面已上线，查看 更多「少数派们」的年度推荐 🙋‍♂️\n> 下载 少数派 2.0 客户端、关注 少数派公众号，解锁全新阅读体验 📰\n© 本文著作权归作者所有，并授权少数派独家使用，未经少数派许可，不得转载使用。",

          "description": "3 年前，Apple 发布了 Apple Watch Series 4，升级了更大显示屏的同时，也带来了心电图功能。然而，国行版本的手表却与它无缘 —— 倒不是说硬件不支持，而是在软件上需要适配及审核。\n直到今天，Apple 在最新的 iOS 15.2 和 watchOS 8.3 系统中，终于将过审已久的心电图功能带到国行 Apple Watch 上。除了心电图之外，iOS 15.2 其实还有不少值得关注的功能，一起来看看吧。\n国行 Apple Watch 支持心电图\n盼望着，盼望着，心电图终于来了。只要你的手表是 Apple Watch S4 及之后的款式，在升级了 watchOS 8.3 和 iOS 15.2 之后，就可以在 iOS 设备的「健康 > 浏览 > 心脏」中打开它。稍等一会，Apple Watch 上便会出现心电图 App。\n如果你先前已经通过各种方式开通了心电图功能，更新后不会受到影响。\n\n要使用心电图也很简单，只需佩戴好手表后打开心电图 App，将另一只手的食指放在数码表冠上，30 秒之后就能完成检测，同时检测结果也会即时同步到 iOS 设备的健康 App 中。你可以在健康 App 中将心电图导出为 PDF 文件提供给医生作为参考。\n不过需要重点注意：Apple Watch 并非专业医疗设备，心电图检测的结果只能参考，不能用于诊断心脏病等疾病。如果对检测的结果有疑问或有身体不适，还是尽快咨询医生为好。\n\n另外值得一提的是，此次国行 Apple Watch 的心电图功能，全称为「移动心电图房颤提示软件」，且软件版本为 V1，支持检测正常心率下的房颤。而目前最新的软件版本为 V2，除了支持 V1 版本的功能外，还能够检测高心率下的房颤。\n\nApp 隐私报告可视化\n在以往的 iOS 15 系统中，App 隐私报告这一功能就已经存在了。只不过彼时我们只能选择导出…",

          "description": "众所周知，去年的 macOS Big Sur 再一次更新了视觉设计风格，其中一项改动就是「焕然一新」的工具栏。至于焕然一新在哪……最明显的地方就是更大的额头。\n\n这样的设计好不好看见仁见智，但有一点是肯定的：这么多的空间如果浪费就太可惜了。 以文件管理器 Finder 为例，尽管系统已经提供了一系列功能图标来充实工具栏，但仍不一定能满足我们的要求。\n实际上，Finder 一直以来都允许用户向工具栏添加任意文件夹、文件或者应用程序图标。 这项功能宣传得很少，但实用性很强，在「大额头」设计的今天更是显得尤其应景。\n至于方法，也极其简单，按住 Command ⌘ 键，然后将任何文件夹、文件或者应用程序的图标拖拽到想要安放的位置，松手即可。\n\n通过这种方法添加到工具栏中的文件夹和应用，在功能上类似于 Dock 中的图标，兼有「传送门」和「篮子」两种功能，换言之：\n\n如果直接点击，则可以打开对应的文件夹或启动应用程序\n如果将某个文件图标拖动到图标上，则可以将该文件移动到对应的文件夹内，或用对应的应用程序打开该文件。\n\n由于工具栏的「区位优势」，通过这种方法适当添加常用文件夹和应用图标，可以有效减少在整理、编辑文件时需要拖动鼠标的距离，优化操作效率。\n如果想让工具栏排布显得更有序，还可以在工具栏空白处点击右键，选择「自定义工具栏」，然后拖拽添加一些「间隙」，为图标建立视觉上的分组效果。\n个人而言，我习惯在工具栏添加「桌面」和「下载」文件夹图标，这样可以随时切换到这两个常用位置或将文件移动过去；应用程序图标则添加了 VS Code 和 iTerm 2，以便快速以纯文本形式查看文件，或者切换到命令行环境继续操作。\n如果在添加图标后想要重新调整顺序，可以再次按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标拖动。如果想要删除已添加的图标，按住 Command ⌘ 键后用鼠标将图标扔出工具栏即可。",

          "description": "常常有小伙伴在问到底该如何选择心理咨询师呢？我来为大家简单介绍一下选择心理咨询师的几个要点。\n \n其实可以分为三个阶段来判断心理咨询师是否靠谱：咨询前、咨询中以及咨询后。\n\n\nPart 1|咨询前\n 确认专业资质和能力 \n\n1. 教育经历\n 在一些西方国家，心理咨询师的培养已经有相对完善的机制，大多是学历培养和继续教育相结合的模式。\n比如美国各州对想要从事心理咨询行业的最低学历要求是硕士，而且基本上是从偏临床心理学或咨询心理学专业毕业的硕士；台湾地区也是要求硕士学历起。\n而在中国大陆，非学历培训是心理咨询从业人员的主要培养方式（张婕等，2011），相关部门/机构也没有出台统一的法律或制度规定从业人员的学历要求。\n\n\n\n国内从事心理咨询的人群主要包括以下几类（刘勉等，2012）：\n\n精神科医生（医学背景，主要在精神专科医院或综合医院的精神/心理科工作）；\n临床心理治疗师（医学或心理学背景，主要在综合医院的医学心理科/心理咨询室工作）；\n学校心理咨询师（心理学或教育学背景，主要在高校心理健康中心及中小学工作）；\n私人执业心理咨询师（各种学科背景都有）。\n\n在选择咨询师时，优先考虑心理学、医学、教育学、社会学背景的人群。考虑到国内临床心理学类的学历教育十分有限，且在学历教育中，对科研训练的重视也高于临床训练。硕士博士等学历水平以及副教授教授等职称，更多时候是代表着科研能力而非临床执业能力，所以只能说高学历高职称相对有保障，但并不绝对。\n2.执业资格\n除了学历和心理学相关专业，还需要考虑咨询师是否具有法律规定的执业资格。\n2018年前国内的咨询师需要通过人力资源保障部门的心理咨询师考试（该考试分为三级和二级），取得证书后咨询师才正式入门，开始执业。为了心理咨询行业更规范地发展，2017年下半年颁布新政策取消了国家心理咨询师等级考试（之前考到的证书仍然有效）。\n\n\n\n但即便有证书，也…",

          "description": "众所周知，MOBA游戏网络效应好、社区属性强，自然增长极快。然而其初期推广难、用户累积慢、运营成本高等问题又总是令让众多厂商纷纷折戟。到今天，纵观市场，似乎只有《王者荣耀》和《无尽对决》曾杀出重围，获得人气与价值的双丰收。其他产品却没有这样好的运气了，不管是网易的《决战！平安京》，还是腾讯的《Arena of Valor》，纵使承载着极高期望和投入，却都没能够翻起太大水花，最终也不过是淹没于茫茫游戏之海，被众人所遗忘。\n\n2020年6月，腾讯和Pokemon Company共同宣布联手打造基于宝可梦IP的轻度MOBA手游《宝可梦大集结》，欲二度冲击海外市场。游戏于2021年7月登录Switch平台，同年9月登录移动端平台。令人惊讶的是，本作并没有照搬腾讯天美信手拈来的Dota式核心战斗模式，而是迎合轻度玩家喜好，从诸如《风暴英雄》和《Splatoon 2》的类MOBA游戏中汲取灵感，将游戏的重心，从杀敌推塔，转移到了收集能量、达阵得分上，让MOBA游戏走上了休闲娱乐的全新道路。腾讯希望依赖宝可梦的全球影响力来吸引到IP粉丝/泛用户，逐步扩圈，培养出更大的欧美MOBA玩家市场。那么，此番采用全新玩法与独特画风、针对不同目标用户群的《宝可梦大集结》，有没有帮助腾讯再下一城呢？\n\n从数据来看，上线三个月的《宝可梦大集结》在海外市场的表现可谓是高开低走。在声势浩大的首周发布后，游戏逐步暴露出新用户获取乏力、现有用户流失多、长期付费不如意等问题。这究竟是什么原因呢？本期《庖丁解游》就将为大家解析一下这款游戏：《宝可梦大集结》。\n\n\n（一）游戏循环：单局对战贯穿始终\n\n《宝可梦大集结》游戏核心循环示意如图，MOBA类游戏的核心循环简单明了，主要以单局对战为基础，在对战—变强—继续对战的链条上衍生诸多其他机制。对《宝可梦大集结》来说，在对战之外，玩家还可以在对战中累计胜场、获得金币，从而…",

          "description": "各位许久不见，我是片冈智！\n有关《水仙》的（实拍）电影化，这里也稍稍写下我个人的感想。\n\n\n事实上至今为止，无论是日本还是美国的制片商，都曾有过电影化的提案。\n而最终拒绝的理由，虽然有好几个……但其中最重要的，则是故事最后“让濑津美的病治好了”的结局设计吧。\n有关最后（濑津美）走向大海的情节，如果是将其做暧昧处理的话倒还可行，然而“治好病了真好呢！”这种“廉价的结局”却是难以容许的。\n我想做出这种结局设计的理由可能有“更讨喜观众”或者其他商业上的考虑……但对于那些只会想着“人死了就是悲剧！就是坏结局（Bad End）！”的人，恐怕《水仙》原本就不会是他们能理解的作品吧。\n\n\n有关这点，本次负责电影化的导演则是纯粹地喜欢着《水仙》，对于何为《水仙》的“核心”也很能理解，我也十分放心。\n哪怕有设定上的变更，只要“核心”不变的话就没问题。\n\n\n反之，仅仅只有设定或者表面上的故事情节依循原作，结局却魔改成“病治好了！幸福结局！”的话可太糟糕了＞＜\n如果不那么做就没法受观众欢迎、商业角度很难成功的话，那还不如别电影化了。\n\n\n如果不那么做就很难找到赞助商的话，那还不如用更低的预算、花上更多的时间去“自由”地创作要来得更好。\n而我自己也会竭尽全力协助的。\n\n\n我想作为（权利）签约方的sekai project，也是能同意这种做法的。\n毕竟对于过去我很少同意Nekoneko Soft作品动画化的理由，他们也是知情的。\n\n\n简而言之，对于《水仙》电影化这件事，某种程度上还请大家放心！\n作为原作者来说我信任着本次企划的导演，而事先做剧本监修的时候，要是有实在不行的内容我也会提出意见。\n\n\n再说一个很现实的情况，这次电影化我自己是拿不到一分钱的w\n但之所以仍然要做，既是作为原作者的自尊、也是为了尽到对喜欢本作的朋友们的义务。\n\n\n\n\n\nお久しぶり、片岡ともです！\nナルキ映画化について、少し長いけど書いてみますね！\n実は今までにも、日本とアメリカからも映画化のオファーがありました。\n断った理由は幾つかありますが……\nラストシーンで「セツミの病気が治る」エンディングを希望されたのが大きいです。\nラストで海に入るシーンを、曖昧にするくらいならＯＫですが、\n病気が治って良かった！な「安易なエンディング」は許容できません。\n恐らく「観客ウケ」や商業的なことも考えた上でのことかも知れませんが……\nそもそも人が死ぬ＝悲劇だ！　バッドエンドだ！としか思えない方に、\n理解できるような作品なのでしょうか？　ナルキは？\n\nそれに対して今回の監督さんは、純粋にナルキ好きの方だと思っています。\n何がナルキの「芯」であるか？を理解している方なら、自分は安心しています。\n幾つかの変更点があったとしても「芯」がブレなければ。\n逆に、設定・表層の出来事だけ原作通りだったとしても、\nラストで病気が治った！ハッピーエンド！とかダメすぎ＞＜\nそうしないと観客ウケ・商業的に厳しいなら、映画化しない方が良い。\nそうしないとスポンサーが付かないのなら、低予算で何年かかっても「自由」に作って貰える方がうれしいです。\n自分も出来る限り協力しますし。\nたぶん契約元のsekai projectさんも、それでＯＫと言うはずです。\n自分がねこねこ作品のアニメ化も、滅多に許可しないことを、よくご存じですし。\n\nそんなわけでナルキ映画化については、ある程度ご安心下さいませ！\n自分としては監督を信頼していますし、\n事前の脚本チェックでダメすぎる場合は、自分も意見すると思います。\nあと、ぶっちゃけですが、映画化しても自分には１円もお金は入って来ませんよw\nでもこれは作者としてのプライドと、作品を気に入ってくれた方への義務だと考えています。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n片冈智\n点击下载\n65 个回答，查看全部。\n如何看待弹丸论破新作Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony中国区的超高定价？\n这配置吃鸡开什么特效最合适 升级硬件升级什么？换E3 1230 v2如何？",

          "description": "​年关将至，如果说回头看这一年联盟出现了什么变化，或许现在高居东部第五的骑士队会是个值得关注的惊喜。\n虽然这么说有点马后炮，但这支球队自小比克斯塔夫接手之后就隐隐约约给人一种将要崛起的气质。\n人们总喜欢从成功的结果往前倒推复盘，然后总结出各种各样的理由，但最后得出的结论往往既没有参考性也没有可复制性，因为球队的发展不是加减乘除的方程式，每一个做出影响的因素都不是固定的常量，变量太多的事情你怎么复制？\n给骑士的成功总结原因其实没多大意思，比起事后吹捧他们怎样慧眼识珠凑到这套阵容，不如讨论一下他们现在到底强在哪里？\n从数据上看，新赛季骑士最好的环节是防守：目前他们每百回合只丢103.5分，这个数字排在联盟第3，仅次于勇士和太阳两支胜率在80%以上的独一档球队。\n\n\n\n而骑士防守出彩很大程度上与他们的三高体系有关。有趣的是，由于活塞曾经有不堪入目的三高失败案例，“德拉蒙德+约什-史密斯+门罗”攻不能守不行，所以骑士实施三高体系的初期并不被球迷看好。\n这也很难说是球迷没有眼光，因为把阿伦+莫布里+马尔卡宁的组合冠以“三高“的标签存在一定的误导性。\n虽然他们的身高都超过2米11，但良好的机动性使得他们不能与普通的内线的球员混为一谈。\n实质上，骑士”三高“内核里藏着的是“小球”，三高确实是高，但他们却具备“小球时代”最强调的核心竞争力——防守的伸缩性。\n阿伦谈到骑士的长人体系这样说：“也许球风回到2001年不是坏事”，但骑士看似古早的篮球哲学只是表象，踩准现代篮球获益点才是他们真正做成的事情。\n尤其是阿伦作为三高体系的代言人，他或许是这个“反差萌”的最佳代表。为什么这么说？因为莫布里和马尔卡宁虽然都是7尺长人，但他们本身就在4-5号位摇摆，甚至能漂移到3号位的现代独角兽。而阿伦属于典型的传统护框型内线，但传统的外衣下却是反差极大的，适应小球时代的可塑性。\n\n\n\n有一组相当有趣的数据，阿…",

He has him cornered at gunpoint. All he has to do is pull the trigger. But he always talks first. He explains the hero's mistakes to him. Jeers. Laughs. And gives the hero time to think his way out of the situation, or be rescued by his buddy. Cf. most James Bond movies.[1]\n反派死于话多之误。反派一直梦想杀掉主角。他已经用枪把主角逼到了墙角，只需轻轻一扣扳机就大功告成了；但他开始详细地阐述主角所犯的错误，然后嘲讽一番、冷笑几声。而所有这些嘴炮存在的意义就是为了让主角有充足的时间思考该如何逃生，或者成功地被同伴解救。007系列电影中的詹姆斯·邦德先生就是这种现象的受益者。\n这本书里还收录了很多奇奇怪的词条，比如：\n推理题材第一法则 First Rule of Whodunits. 在许多凶…",

          "description": "电影《雄狮少年》今天终于上映了！从2019年到今天，经过两年多的时间，今天终于要和大家见面了，关于对于这部电影的评价，我想把它交给观众。今天我想跟大家分享一下这部电影一些创作点滴和自己的一些背景。\n根据我们故事的风格和特点，我们整个美术风格是偏写实的，卡通程度没有那么高。镜头里的场景，光影，氛围都在尽量还原真实的岭南村庄。而我们的角色必须融入这个环境，没有违和感，而且用他们演绎一个这么烟火气的故事必须可信。\n狮头我们完全是按照真实狮头来的，没有加入过多设计，因为我们觉得真实狮头的设计就已经非常经典了。而真实的南派狮头是有多种风格的，因此我们在电影里采用了三种不用造型的狮头：“传统狮头”（陈壮成、年轻时的咸鱼强使用的狮头）“新派狮头”（阿娟使用的狮头）和“鹤山狮头”（无极狮队使用的狮头）\n\n\n关于人物\n\n刚开始尝试了很多版本，每个角色大概都有7-8稿吧，有些设计是很成熟的，但总觉得没有画出我们心中那种有烟火气的市井的感觉。\n后来我们找到了光圈，他的设计风格正好和我们的需求完美契合，每个角色几乎都是第一稿就能确定方向。\n最终定版人物形象的原因：小人物的故事、突出小人物的朴素感、结合故事背景是乡村少年、故事中的人物最终也要打破偏见\n\n\n关于场景\n\n因为我们大部分故事是发生在乡下，所以我们跑遍了广州周边各种村落。\n最后我们在顺德找到了两个最符合我们想象的村子：百丈村和北水村，这里有鱼塘，村里的房子就散布在大大小小的鱼塘上，非常漂亮。而且还有一些很有历史的祠堂和老宅子，最重要的是，这里还有很多村民居住，很有生活气息。\n\n有些村子虽然很有历史，但已经变成旅游景点，村民基本已经不在那里生活了，感觉只剩一个壳，没有灵魂了。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n然后我团队就开始一遍遍去这两个村子里采风，搜集各种村民生活的细节，还有了解村里的植被，南方乡村的植被是很有特点的，非常丰富。\n我们要了解这里植被的种类，墙上的青苔是怎样的，缝隙里的小草是怎样的，有哪些常见的树，怎样分布的。\n\n\n\n\n还有这些植物的四季变化，因为我们故事的时间跨度有一年多，我们的采风也持续了一年。\n同时我们还开发了一系列的技术流程去呈现这些内容，为了研究木棉的生长规律，我们特效总监甚至把电脑搬去一棵木棉树下去工作了两天。\n\n最后呈现出来的效果我们都非常满意，观看有些画面时甚至都能闻到村子里的味道。大家都觉得这些付出很值得。\n\n\n关于舞狮\n\n首先是动作的问题，舞狮有很多技巧，专业性很强，要通过肢体动作去表现狮子各种各样的神态，之前我们是完全不了解的。为了弥补这个问题，我们导演组和动画师特意去专业的舞狮队做了培训，然后才开始设计舞狮相关的动作场面。为了打起来更漂亮，我们还融合了一些武术和舞蹈动作，做了适当的夸张。\n然后就是布料和毛发的解算问题，狮子身上的毛发非常多，而且是多层布料解算（舞狮队员身上有衣服，然后外面还要披上狮尾），再加上狮尾复杂的剪裁方式（现代的狮尾结构很复杂，中间还加了橡皮筋增加弹性，在舞狮的时候可以伸缩）是一个非常复杂的系统工程。我们都一一作了仔细的研究和测试，最终在三维软件中模拟出完美的动态。\n最后就是渲染，毛发渲染一向是三维渲染中最耗时的工作之一，一两头狮子还好。但我们的决赛有130多头狮子出现，现场看台上有1800多个观众，再加上公园里围观的1000多名游客，还有大量茂密的植被......想想就是一件很可怕的事情，最初我们都不确定能不能渲染出来，我们做了大量的研究和开发工作才能保证决赛镜头的顺利渲染。\n我们这部电影在条件有限的情况下，大家都憋足了一口气要做最棒的作品，这种感觉太棒了，能和他们一起创作是我的荣幸。\n\n要特别说一句的是我们音乐总监栾慧，他为了这部作品推掉了很多工作，专门从东北老家来到广州在我们楼下宾馆里搭建了一个工作室和我们一起工作了半年多，所以这次我们的音乐和画面契合度非常高，因为我随时都能下楼和他一起讨论关于音乐的想法，而且他随时都能上楼看到我们最新的画面，甚至有很多重要戏份的剪辑都是根据他的音乐，我和他一起做了精确的调整，达到音乐和画面的完美匹配。\n而且我们在制作中经历了疫情封锁，我们公司所在的芳村正好处于疫情中心，一夜之间整个区域停止一切活动，我们只能居家办公，也因此导致了制作的延期，当时的绝望情绪现在还历历在目，还好政府迅速控制住了疫情，而我们也利用这次延期的机会做了一些很重要的修改，让我们的作品更进一步，也算是因祸得福吧。\n   很荣幸这一路遇到了很多志同道合的朋友们，也感谢那些与我们素未谋面的观众们的喜爱和支持。希望更多人也能关注到我们国产原创动画，也希望中国传统文化被更多年轻人追逐。\n\n\n孙海鹏\n点击下载\n1060 个回答，查看全部。\n动画电影《雄狮少年》中有哪些彩蛋？\n《雄狮少年》代表了国产动画电影发展的新思路吗？",

          "description": "想来聊点背后的故事。或许有生之年很难再遇上像2020东京奥运一样的情形了（也别再来了）。\n 备赛四年变五年。记不清是央视采访哪位运动员来着，她说，“那天一早去训练馆，瞅着倒计时牌从100多天跳成了400多天。一下泄了劲儿，特崩溃”。100%的真实回应，不分项目，也无关国籍。\n就我而言，多出来的一年，比前面四年难得多的多。撇开年龄和体能，最大的顾虑是家庭。因为疫情，得全封闭训练。其实我家就住天津，离不远的，两个女儿都还小外加老人，本是最需要我的时候，担子却全落在了妻子身上。\n艳子曾经也是一名举重运动员，所有的纠结和挣扎她最懂。后来，她反倒跑来宽慰我说，“就暂时把你交给国家了。（其他）别担心。”这话，是真扎到我心里了，同时也是继续坚持的最大动力。\n 说回备战，变化很多。先是时隔20年首次级别调整。我那会考虑到岁数大之后你降体重，肯定对各方面有影响。索性打81，上了4公斤。但实际上，我和余导对把增加的体重转换成更稳定的技术这方面，什么经验都没有。\n 东奥最棘手还有个什么呢，是国际举联修改的新积分规则，要求必须在2018年11月-2020年4月的三个比赛区间内完成6站积分赛。相当于每两个月就得打一次高强度比赛。就这段时间，我遭遇了生涯内最艰难的一场比赛。也是给自己逼到绝境的一场。\n 2019年9月的泰国芭提雅积分赛，决定拿不拿得到东奥入场券的关键比赛。抓举我开把是165，有点着急了，往前迈了两步掉了，把腰扭了。一个小关节的错位，当时没感觉太出来。第三把，我和小14岁的队友李大银都抓了171。一切就看挺举了。\n 两项间歇时，身体反应就显出来了。动不了，腰肌一下子缩到一团，弯腰都弯不下去。没办法，只能把挺举第一把从计划的200降到191，想着先保个总成绩吧。杠一扔，痛感爆发，走路都走不了，人被架着下场了。\n当时余导过来劝，要不放弃吧，别把身体搞坏了。怎么说呢，没来及想什么多的，就一条，不想放弃每一把，边趴着敷冰袋边回：“不可能，确实不能（弃）”。完了第二把直接加到了205。因为是最高重量，可以等全部人举完再上，也算是战术给自己换多点休息时间。\n 205，是刷新世界纪录的重量。完全是咬死了牙才撑起来的。杠一扔，人就往一边歪了，勉强没倒地。没多久，大银最后一把举过了206，二刷纪录。当时全场就剩我的第三把，顶了个207。这是一个我从来没有在国际比赛上挑战过的重量，但能不能去东京就此一举了。再怎么疼，也不想留遗憾，必须再试一把，给它拼了！\n\n要说犹没犹豫过腰伤呢，也犹豫，但一上台感觉就来了。也不是纯说胜负欲吧，就是想把最好的一面展现给全世界热爱举重的人看。我是真喜欢台上的感觉。\n 说到胜负欲，对2016年的里约奥运，是有的。五年来继续坚持的理由，有它一份，想再较量一把，还是有那么点不服气吧。\n 说个东奥决赛开场前的小插曲，也是后来少见开把没成的教训。权当给大伙避雷。\n 那会中国举重队已经收了三个级别的冠军，我是有压力的。后台区就一直在调情绪，调着调着感觉要爆棚了，还跑去跟余导提“要不开抓170吧”。没同意，依旧165，完了没带起来（兴奋过头随意了）。下场余导很严肃说要重视，我也跟自己说：“就两把了，不能再乱来了。”静下来一步步想动作，怎么带，怎么展。抓举成绩稳在了170。\n\n 挺举开把实话说有瞬间，闪过了2016年的画面。抬杠那下，还是有点害怕掉了的，咬牙硬顶。197一过，心态就完全放开了。第二把204，从握杠就憋足了气，完事锁定金牌后，是有点小喜悦的，趁着斗志又报了210。翻站的时候调铃没有调好，稍微歪了点，丢了。有点可惜。\n 评价什么的不敢讲，比赛很享受，但过程真的很难很难。最想说的是，这份荣誉不光属于个人，而是实实在在地属于整个中国举重队。\n 我是吕小军，一个像热爱生命一样热爱举重的中国人。\n\n\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n吕小军\n点击下载\n182 个回答，查看全部。\n2020 东京奥运举重男子组 73 公斤决赛石智勇夺金，如何评价本场比赛？\n2020 东京奥运会举重女子 87 公斤级决赛汪周雨夺金，如何评价本场比赛?",

          "description": "最近两天刚在 Steam 上玩过《纸嫁衣》，游戏不贵也就十几块钱，体验还蛮不错的。这里就简单地向大家推荐推荐这部国产恐怖点击解密游戏佳作吧。\n\n与之前非常出名的《烟火》一样，《纸嫁衣》也是一部主打中式恐怖的作品，不过相比起来后者在表现形式上要更加通俗传统一些。游戏围绕「冥婚」这个主题，讲述了一段男主为寻找在新婚之日突然失踪的未婚妻而历经神鬼怪异之事的有曲折、有反转的好故事（不过最后还是小小「走近科学」了一下，原因大家懂的）。正常走完大约 2-3 小时流程，属于小体量作品。\n\n虽然包含少量 Jumpscare，但游戏恐怖氛围的塑造主要还是依靠故事和场景中大量加入的民俗恐怖元素（纸人挡道、黑白无常、老村庙祠、厉鬼打墙、道士作法……），熟悉之余不禁叫人头皮发麻、脊背生凉。正如很多朋友在他们的评测中所说的那样：「果然中国人才最会吓中国人」。\n\n\n\n游戏在谜题设置上同样融入了很多民俗要素（诸如阴阳八卦、风水符咒、冥钱纸钞等），整体来看解密难度适中也有不错的趣味性，但也存在部分谜题过于生硬跳脱的问题。对只想观看剧情不想动脑筋的朋友，游戏也提供了十分友好的提示系统（仅有数十秒冷却的限制，部分较困难谜题甚至允许玩家直接跳过），各位是完全可以一路跟着提示顺畅玩到通关的。\n\n\n\n《纸嫁衣》其实是一款移植自移动平台的游戏，并且已经在移动平台上推出二代《奘铃村》，同样颇受好评。目前制作组正乘热打铁继续开发系列第三作，这里就期待新作早日面世了。\n最后再发散一些感想吧。制作组在游戏介绍中如此说到他们的制作初衷：「中国传统民俗中有大量脑洞大开的灵异故事，但此类题材的游戏却很少见，在看过《聊斋志异》、《太平广记》、《山村老尸》等小说、电影后我们觉得只有自己做恶梦实在太浪费了，于是决定制作一款纯正的中式恐怖游戏」。私认为「中式恐怖」的确是一个非常好的游戏创新路子，不仅与众不同、刺激有趣，还能起到传播传统文化的作用。\n说起来，邻邦日本在继承发扬民俗文化这块做得就很不错。聚焦于悬疑惊悚类文艺作品的创作，日本就形成了独特的「日式恐怖」风格，其在全球都有市场和拥趸，某种意义上已经成为了一种「文化名片」；而在游戏领域，日本游戏界则诞生了以《死魂曲》系列、《零》系列为代表的知名日式恐怖游戏作品。\n\n虽然目前我们已经拥有了包括《烟火》《诡港实录》等在内的一些本土恐怖佳作，但要说真正形成为世人广泛认可的独有风格还为时尚早。所以，这里也非常希望未来我国游戏界能继续涌现一批新的优秀作品，在恐怖游戏这个相对小众的领域中走出属于我们的路子来。\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n呆罗\n点击下载\n22 个回答，查看全部。\n纸糊的药丸是怎么生产的？\n《纸嫁衣 2 奘铃村》讲的是一个什么样的故事？",

          "description": "一证虽小，意义非凡！！\n自《中华人民共和国退役军人保障法》落地之后，退役军人优待证何时发放，成为了退役军人所关心的一个话题。\n因为对于广大退役军人来说，“退役军人优待证”不仅意味着可以享受诸多福利，还是身份与荣誉的一种象征。\n退役军人优待证的作用，具体体现在以下几个方面： \n一、可以持证享受优先、优惠待遇\n当前，全国各个省市都相继发布了退役军人优待清单目录，可见国家与社会对于退役军人的重视程度。\n退役军人持优待证，可以享受铁路、公路、航空、地方医疗机构挂号、旅游等各个方面的优先与优惠待遇。\n\n在之前，不少人“吐槽”现役军人的优先购票、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具很鸡肋，因为现役军人每年假期少，而且现在都是网上购票，优先购票待遇、免费乘坐市内公共交通工具用处不大。\n但退役军人凭优待证可以免费游览部分公园、风景名胜区、旅游风景区、纪念馆、博物馆以及开放式文物保护单位等场所，好处是实打实的，看得见，摸得到的。\n\n二、光荣的象征\n 退役军人优待证虽小，但是所包含的意义非常重大。\n 退役军人优待证是全国统一制发、统一编号的，意味着每个人的优待证都是个人“专属”，这是对退役军人牺牲奉献的认可与褒奖。\n对于退役军人来说，这是荣誉的象征，是社会地位的象征，在物质优待与帮助的基础上，再增加精神上的尊重与鼓励，能够让退役军人拥有更多的获得感与幸福感。\n三、身份的证明\n 军人退役之后，所能证明退役军人身份的证件并不是很多，大多数只有退役证件这一个。\n 退役证的实际功能并不是非常多，而且，退役证容易被造假。\n 而退役军人优待证不仅功能明显优于退伍证，还采用防伪技术，能够有效防止证件造假，在证明退役军人身份的同时，还能更好地保障退役军人待遇落实及合法权益的维护。\n四、全国通用\n近年来，部分省市相继推出了省级或者是市级的退役军人优待证，但使用时有一定的局限性，比如仅限当市或者是当省使用。\n而退役军人优待证是由国家发放，全国通用，拿着优待证，走到全国任何地方，都可以享受规定优待。\n不用担心有的地方因为经济情况存在政策落实不到位的情况，统一的政策，统一的待遇，不会让退役军人因地区差异而带来心理上的不平衡。 \n退役军人优待证，是退役军人曾经尽过光荣、伟大义务的一种证明，是对自己牺牲与家人团聚的时间，奉献青春的一种交代，是物质奖励，也是精神奖励。\n\n而未来，退役军人已一定会拥有更多的优待与荣誉，让退役军人以“曾经当过兵”而感到光荣！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\n三剑客\n点击下载\n8 个回答，查看全部。\n我国军人的战斗意志是不是世界最强的？\n军人不能上传照片吗？",

          "description": "大家好，我是《冰火魔厨》的执行制片人Neena。\n非常感谢大家对《冰火魔厨》的关注，同时也很高兴与大家分享我们在创作《冰火魔厨》动画时的心路历程，下面的内容涉及动画内容的剧透，建议大家先去优酷平台观看过后再来阅读，会更有共鸣。\n我们之所以关注到这部小说，是因为它具有“美食结合魔法战斗”的独特性，同时也是三少老师认为当时他最用心，关注度最高的一部小说。所以在动画的创作过程中我们也深知责任在肩，唯有精益求精。\n首先，这部小说之所以能收获如此多人的喜爱，一定是因为“情”，所以我们也将这点融入到了每个环节中。无论是开篇父母对念冰血浓于水的亲情，还是查极对念冰教导的师生之情都让人十分感动。但作品中最打动人心的还是主人公明知不可能逃避不公的命运，仍旧不放弃自己，不被命运支配的精神。\n\n\n\n其次，对于网友们一直很关注的念冰的七把神刃，我们也是秉持遵照原著以及七种魔法延伸出来的视觉表现去设计的。色调上，七系魔法有各自专属的颜色和相对应属性的特效。例如，冰系的刀，我们从材质上增加其冰霜感，使整个刀刃就像冰制的一样。结霜的这种特效，也是从蓝色系入手同时搭配银质的配饰，使高冷气质拉满。火系的刀，是根据火龙的生活属性打造，以火龙角为主，也就是一个天然火龙角大刀。我们给刀身配有熔岩一样的裂痕，体现了火元素炎热的感觉。风系的刀，则将刀身设计成锋利的流线型，在空气中能迅速划过。剩下的几把刀我就不过多剧透了，就由小伙伴们自己去了解吧~\n\n厨艺结合魔法，甚至可以将情绪融入饭菜中，影响食客的心情，是男主角融念冰必杀技，所以他在学习魔法的进阶之路上也有诸多精彩的故事。虽然魔法已经在动漫里不是新鲜的元素了，但是我们想要做出一点心意来！所以我们根据每个系不同的属性，归纳了一套属于每个系独有的花纹。比如冰系的法术，我们利用一些经典的雪花纹造型，给它结构重组，同时优化制作了全新的冰类法针。火焰系的法术，我们则是运用了中国传统的火焰云纹元素，同时也结合了火焰类的特效。像水系、土系，我们其实都是与传统花纹相结合规划出了专属每个系的元素、符号和图案，包括法阵上用的一些符文，我们也分出了一些类别，不同的符文，对应不同属性的法术、法阵。这个也会让视觉效果达到高能观感，所以也建议大家去优酷看看正片感受一下。\n\n对于原著作品的还原度大家不必担心，我们对于这部承载无数人青春回忆的小说抱有高度尊重，即便有修改也是根据当下审美做些调整。\n最后十分感谢唐家三少老师作为总策划全程参与了该项目的研发与制作，从内容构建、剧本监修、原画及模型审核等等多方面给我们制作组提供了非常好的想法和建议。也希望得到大家对于《冰火魔厨》动画的一些想法和建议！祝大家看的开心～\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nNeena\n点击下载\n49 个回答，查看全部。\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》第108集？\n如何评价动画《斗罗大陆》播放量破百亿？",

          "description": "如此有价值的一个问题不光没几个人答，而且先前仅有的两个回答居然都在胡说八道……这不能忍，怒答一发。\n羽毛球世界杯赛的“停办”在历史上一共有两次，一次是1997-2005的暂时停办，一次就是2006年后至今的无限期永久停办，而这两次停办背后的原因其实是完全不同的。\n这项赛事最初的举办是在1981年——那一年的另外一个重大历史事件就是原国际羽联IBF和原世界羽联WBF正式合并成新的国际羽联IBF（也就是现在我们熟悉的新世界羽联BWF的前身），而它的首次停办是在1997年，这期间一共举办了17次比赛，但可能出乎很多人常识认知范畴之外的是，这17次比赛的主办方其实并不是世界羽联IBF，而是总部位于美国纽约的国际管理集团IMG。\n\n由此我们也可以得知，1997年的羽毛球世界杯赛停办，其背后的根本原因应当是由于作为主办方的IMG集团内部的业务变更与项目调整，尽管具体的情况目前已不得而知，但可以想见国际羽联对于这次停办的话语权应当不是很大的。\n然而新世纪以来在湖南益阳分别于2005年和2006年举办的第18和第19届世界杯赛的情况以及世界杯赛在那之后的第二次停办，其背后的原因则与前文所述大相径庭。\n\n首先不同于以往的是，这两届世界杯赛事的重启已经不再经过原本作为赛事主办方的IMG集团的点头，而是在当时由国际羽联IBF方面自行牵头、并同时联合我国的一些大型国有企业与地方私营企业（譬如中国移动和赛琪体育等）进行合作规划从而最终得以实现的，同时在性质上也被重新认定是不计世界排名积分的“邀请赛”——尽管从届数上这两次比赛仍按第18、19届世界杯进行顺延，也就是名义上仍继承了此前于1997年停办的老世界杯赛的衣钵，但由于整个比赛重启之后一直带着一股抹不去的“非正式赛事”的味道，因此在公众看来其在此后进行常态化办赛的前景始终是不明朗的。\n其次也是最主要的一点就是这两届“新世界杯”的赛制与赛事性质的定…",

          "description": "每当谈起“谁是NBA下一个超巨”时，大家会抬出东契奇、特雷·杨、莫兰特……等等一系列如雷贯耳的名字，但有一个人似乎被我们下意识地遗漏了，那就是曾被誉为詹姆斯之后最强状元的锡安。\n当然，漏掉锡安其实是一件很正常的事情，因为他本赛季还没有出战哪怕一场比赛。更让人无语的是，今天鹈鹕官方宣称，锡安的第五跖骨愈合出现了倒退的情况，同时多位消息人士透露，锡安经过手术的右脚出现了持续酸痛感，可能会暂时停止篮球相关活动。\n总的来说就一句话，短时间内我们在比赛当中是看不到胖虎了……\n\n作为2019届的状元秀，锡安的天赋是毋庸置疑的，当初他参加选秀时，不少专家就表示，在NBA历史上根本找不到锡安的模板。没几个身高198cm的球员拥有他这样的大块头，同时还能保持着超强的运动能力。巴克利或许在体型上可以和锡安媲美，但两人的爆发力也不在同一个档次。\n从高中到大学，锡安各类奖项拿到手软，影响力也是一再攀升。在杜克对阵北卡的焦点大战中，锡安踩爆了脚上的耐克球鞋，这一事件直接导致耐克的市值蒸发了20亿美金。随后耐克第一时间发表了道歉声明，还解雇了一位在公司工作8年的球鞋制作者，锡安的恐怖影响力由此可见一斑。\n\n大体重给锡安提供了超强的冲击力，但也给他的膝盖带来了沉重的负担。刚进联盟，锡安就在夏季联赛的赛场上撞伤左膝，季前赛又再度受伤，并因此缺席了菜鸟赛季的前44场比赛。到目前为止，锡安一共只打了85场比赛，穿着西装坐在场边看队友打球对他来说已经是家常便饭了。\n锡安强吗？当然强，新秀赛季他就以58.3%的命中率场均砍下22.5分6.3篮板2.1助攻，第二个赛季更是提升到了27.0分7.2篮板3.7助攻，投篮命中率高达61.1%，他也因此入选了全明星。尽管不少人认为缺少外线投射是锡安的重大缺陷，但对于这个超级攻城锤来说，只要杀进内线就能解决问题。\n\n然而再强的球员，只有披挂上阵才能展现出价值，坐在场下就啥也不是。本赛季鹈鹕暂时位列西部倒数第一，和锡安的缺席有很大关系，可他自己似乎并没有把这放在心上。\n早在赛季开始前，锡安就在训练中遭遇第五跖骨骨折，随后接受了手术。按道理来说，脚部受伤的球员会更加小心翼翼地控制体重来抵抗伤病，可锡安呢？本赛季他第一次出现在场边的时候，所有人都震惊了，这个已经胖成球的家伙是哪位？\n据美媒透露，锡安的体重已经来到了330磅，也就是差不多300斤。要知道奥尼尔在巅峰时期也不过是325磅，更何况他的身高达到了216cm，而锡安只有198cm。之前锡安的体重已经让很多专家和球迷对他的膝盖感到担忧，现在又增加了40多斤，俨然成为了一颗危险的定时炸弹。\n\n其实之前鹈鹕也做过一些措施，上个月他们为锡安更换了训练师和食谱，还改变了烹饪习惯，希望锡安能够尽快恢复，同时将体重给减下去。现在看来，球队的努力已经打了水漂，锡安距离复出遥遥无期，减重更是无从谈起，只要没有继续胖下去，鹈鹕就该谢天谢地了。\n以锡安的天赋和影响力，成为超巨只是时间问题，但现在他已经陷入了困境。以NBA球员能够利用的资源，只要有足够的毅力，减重不是什么大事，可一旦放纵自己，那就悲剧了。\n\n在NBA历史上，不乏放纵自我最终堕落的天才球员，远的有“雨人”坎普，近的也有埃迪·库里和巴朗·戴维斯，他们都是发福之后状态暴跌的典范。如果锡安不下定决心控制自己的体重，这些前辈们就是他的前车之鉴！\n\n来源：知乎 www.zhihu.com\nKay King\n点击下载",

          "description": "就像我之前一直说的，即便是电动车，也一样拥有驾驶乐趣，特别是在优秀的调校加持下，更是如此。\n作为一个小马力前驱车驾驶员，能得出这样的结论，跟我前不久驾（bai）驶（嫖）的一台车有很大关系，那就是小鹏的P7高性能版，那期节目相信很多人都还有印象。\n\n1.底盘结构影响操控感\n其实，要搞懂这个问题，我们最先该聊的，根本就不是动力形式，而最重要的东西，是底盘设计。\n什么样的底盘才是“键盘值最高”或者说比较理想的结构呢？这个问题可能问100个人会有100种答案，但是放心，其中出镜率最高的，绝对是两种，双叉臂和多连杆。考虑到造车理念，成本还有布置空间等一系列的问题，现在市面上能见到的，“最具键盘值”的底盘结构非前双叉臂后多连杆莫属了。\n\n保时捷确实前桥使用的麦弗逊，但是人家的调校功力和开发预算并非常规厂家能比的，因此它的厉害并不影响我们以上的结论。\n\n这个结构市场上确实不算是很多见，但是其实有这么几款电动车都用了这个结构，像特斯拉Model 3、小鹏P7、蔚来ET7等这些车型。\n\n\n\n而且在使用这个结构的同时，基本上都顺手把能用铝合金的部件都用上了铝合金。这其实跟这些“新势力”厂商开发新车基本上都没有上代车型有很大关系，我要是造车从零开始的话，我肯定也会选择用一个至少从理论上要表现更好的结构啊。\n\n\n2.调校也很重要\n结构不错是个基础，但是接下来的调校也是一关考验，就好像一个钢琴，再是好牌子，调音师是个业余的门外汉，出来的产品也并不会非常优秀的。都说保时捷造车造的好，开着感受好，其实，里面不光是投资，更是有着一个优秀且专业的团队在背后默默付出。什么？你说养不起这么大的团队？那好办，保时捷旗下的保时捷工程公司能够随时成为你的供应商，帮你调车。\n\n没错，保时捷旗下有这么一家名为保时捷工程的公司，这家公司的技术团队有保时捷工程是的实力，这个团队不造车，但是会参与到有需求的厂家的造车过程中，也…",

          "description": "大家好，我是腾讯的游戏美术设计师Calvin。大约2010年，我有幸涉足了DNF、QQ炫舞、疾风之刃、QQ飞车等产品的影视宣传，随即便入了游戏行业的坑，直奔琳琅天上工作室（也就是现在的天美），开启了我十年的游戏美术设计生涯。\n作为老飞车玩家，秉持着对飞车的喜爱，这十年来，我一直从事QQ飞车的制作。从起初的端游场景赛道设计，到现在端/手游双端场景设计、IP包装、CG........每一个环节都留下了我努力搬砖的身影。\n工作之余，我喜欢画画、模玩、游戏，也喜欢旅游，因此看到这个话题，我想我可以简单地向大家分享一下我的观点。\n先说结论，我认为游戏是有潜力带动旅游业的，尤其是在疫情隔离的影响之后，如何鼓励人们从宅在家，到有意愿出去散心走走，一个好的办法，就是让大家在游戏中去看见，甚至体验旅游景地的美好风景与人文温度。\n身为休闲赛车游戏《QQ飞车手游》的美术负责人，近几年我们一直在尝试将游戏与现实中的景点结合，比如今年我们与四川省旅游宣传促进中心合作，在游戏里推出了“梦回古蜀”与“云游天府”两条全新赛道，去一站式、沉浸式地呈现现实中的三星堆博物馆与四川的人文风貌。\n\n“梦回古蜀”赛道展示的“古”，是四川的历史沉淀。玩家驾车驶入庞大的三星堆博物馆，在曲折幽暗的地宫回廊中穿梭，一路经过巨大的青铜立人像与太阳神鸟，去丈量和感受那神秘厚重的古蜀文明，体验一种冒险感。\n\n\n\n\n与之相比，“云游天府”赛道则展现的是“今”，是四川的现代生活。在乐山大佛的脚下，坐卧着岁月静好的山城，有川剧变脸、蜀绣隽美、熊猫嬉闹，也有火锅串串的飘香、麻将的热闹、宽窄巷子的风情，体验一种安逸巴适，人间烟火的生活氛围。\n\n\n\n\n在社交平台和部分随机问卷调查中，有不少玩家称赞了四川主题赛道的设计，并希望我们推出更多地域文化与传统文化的联名赛道，并为自己的家乡打call。这确实让我们感到十分欢喜，也认定“游戏”与“文化旅游…",

Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world's tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn't see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town.

          "description": "Today we completely break Cuphead speedruns by using the Mugman Army glitch. This glitch allows us to spawn unlimited Mugman clones, and can results in some extremely fast fights. This speedrun is one of my favorites\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the world record run here: https://youtu.be/WOvPL91CKTc\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nThis speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",

Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. \n\nCaptain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.",

You can check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg\n\nHere is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I’ve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own — and though I’m not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??\n\nAlso, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron & I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea & Megan for letting us film at your store!\n\nCheck out our new merch here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com/\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

This mission is scheduled to lift off at 7:20 a.m. EST (12:20 UTC), Dec. 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.\n\nWith revolutionary technology, Webb will observe a part of space and time never seen before, providing a wealth of amazing views into an era when the very first stars and galaxies formed––over 13.5 billion years ago.\n\nIt can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and study the atmospheres of distant worlds. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more! It’s the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built.\n\nWebb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make Webb a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries!\n \nReady to #UnfoldTheUniverse? The greatest origin story of all unfurls soon. Learn more at https://nasa.gov/jwst",

The song was played as part of the Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, a carol service that reflected upon the difficult past 18 months for people across our nation, and particularly for those who might be more vulnerable, isolated or have limited access to support.\n\n#TogetherAtChristmas was a moment to recognise those who have struggled during the pandemic, as well as to celebrate the individuals and organisations who carried out inspirational acts of kindness and incredible feats to help those in need in our communities. \n\nWith thanks to Tom Walker: https://www.youtube.com/c/iamtomwalker\n\nWatch more:\nMental Health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEarly Years: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEngagements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBeZm...\n\nFollow us on our other channels:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dukeandduchessofcambridge\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal",

I've built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob's house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I've never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “Fortnite Chapter 3!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",

Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok \"For You Page\"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?\n\nThanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!\nYou can check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/kayleymelissa\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: hhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nMadi Price\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

          "description": "英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中引入一个特殊的变化，可以在不重启系统的情况下更新系统固件。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n去年发现的几个安全漏洞，使得系统管理员很难在不停机的情况下迅速修补系统。\n\r\n如果能做出一些改进，在不重启系统的情况下更新一些关键组件以提高安全/性能呢？\n\r\n英特尔旨在通过其新的 PFRUT（平台固件运行时更新和遥测Platform Firmware Runtime Update and Telemetry）驱动程序来实现这一目标。\n\r\n英特尔计划在 Linux 内核 5.17 中提供 PFRUT\n\r\n虽然 Linux 内核 5.16 将在本周晚些时候发布，不过英特尔的目标是将这一新的功能合并到即将发布的 Linux 内核 5.17 稳定版。\n\r\n但是，它究竟是什么？\n\r\n有了 PFRUT 驱动，特定组件（或系统固件）可以在系统运行时进行更新，而不需要重新启动。\n\r\n最初，英特尔倾向于将其称为“无缝更新”解决方案。然而，随着最近被添加到 Linux 电源管理的 linux-next 分支中的 Linux 内核提交，他们可能会继续使用一个厂商中立的名字，即 pfrut_driver。\n\r\n顺便说一句，linux-next 分支代表着这些变化将进入下一个 Linux 内核稳定版（5.17）。\n\r\n在技术上，这个 提交 对该变化的解释如下：\n\r\n\r\n用户应该提供 EFI 封包，并通过将该封包写入设备的特殊文件以将其传递给驱动程序。驱动程序在特定的 ACPI 平台固件运行时更新ACPI Platform Firmware Runtime Update设备（INTC1080）的 ACPI _DSM 方法的帮助下，将封包传输到平台固件，而实际的固件更新是由平台固件中的低级管理模式代码进行的。\n\r\n\r\n就像人们通常期望的那样，这应该可以消除停机时间，可以对解决任何安全和性能改进的固件进行基本更新。而且，系统固件更新可以很容易地直接通过操作系统（这里是 Linux）进行。\n\r\n正如其中一个 详细说明其工作原理的 PDF 文件 中强调的那样，驱动程序的遥测部分是为了 “从 MM 中检索日志信息，以进行监控并找出问题的根本原因”。\n\r\n请注意，这只有在 Linux 系统和英特尔芯片上才能实现。\n\r\n考虑到当你需要修补系统固件以抵御安全问题时，等待系统上的任务完成不是一种理想状况，这种能力的增加应该是非常方便的。\n\r\n这是为 Linux 桌面或服务器准备的吗？\n\r\n该改进主要是为服务器专用硬件量身定做的。\n\r\n英特尔的官方文件指出，这是为具有高服务水平协议（SLA）的系统准备的，这种 SLA 需要尽量减少重启。\n\r\n然而，这对拥有企业级系统的特定桌面用户群应该也是有用的。\n\r\n虽然这可能不是桌面 Linux 发行版必不可少的东西，但它可能是改善用户体验的一个令人兴奋的开始。特别是对于热衷于保持系统固件更新而不严重干扰其工作的用户。\n\r\n这也应该可以引入更多类型的更新的可能性，当涉及到 BIOS 或 UEFI 时，可以由操作系统而不是主板处理。\n\r\n这不仅限于为你的桌面配置服务器级别的硬件的 Linux 桌面用户。\n\r\n虽然目前只限于 Linux 系统，但这也应该很快可以用于 Windows 和其他操作系统。\n\r\n你对英特尔推出的这一变化有何看法？你认为这是对系统固件更新处理方式的一个重大改进吗？\n\r\n欢迎在下面的评论中分享你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/intel-linux-kernel/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这组文章展示了企业如何与开源软件连接。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n开源软件不仅仅创造了专有软件的替代品。在商业方面，开源已经成为一个“力量的倍增器”来改变组织的经营方式。同时，越来越多的公司开始采用更多的开源方法，甚至在管理团队和流程方面。\n\r\n在过去的一年里，我们发表了许多优秀的文章，展示了企业如何与开源软件相联系。以下是一些阅读量最大的文章：\n\r\n《开源给你带来竞争优势的 4 种方式》\n\r\n为了在当今快节奏的世界中取得成功，企业必须对数字解决方案进行明智的投资，使他们能够更快地行动并提高运营的灵活性。这正是越来越多的各种规模和各种行业的组织拥抱开源解决方案的原因。根据麦肯锡的一份报告，开源的采用是表现优异的组织的最大差异化因素。Jason Blais 写了采用开源技术可以帮助组织推动竞争优势和体验更好的业务成果的 四个原因。\n\r\n《为什么 Crate.io 回归其纯粹的开源根源》\n\r\n开源技术提供企业级的可扩展性、性能、安全性和可靠性。信任就在那里，而且是当之无愧的。但除了顽固的开源信徒之外，较少被人称道的是日常社区贡献的内部运作，在原子级别建立了这些宏观利益。对于那些提供开源技术的人来说，社区不断的用户驱动的测试和加固将这些技术锻造成强大和成熟的解决方案。Crate.io 的联合创始人 Bernd Dorn 写道，该组织从“开放核心” 转变 为采用 Apache 2.0 许可的纯开源。\n\r\n《为什么非营利组织选择开源软件》\n\r\n随着科技和数据安全意识的提高，开源软件比以往任何时候都更成为各阶层组织的首选。非营利组织在财务方面尤其脆弱，同时又要处理重要的社会和环境问题。Michael Korotaev 以 Nextcloud 和 ONLYOFFICE为 例，写了关于在非营利组织中 采用开源协作技术 的文章。\n\r\n《管理开源产品路线图》\n\r\n客户，以及与他们交谈的销售和营销团队，都喜欢一个路线图。它让他们了解什么是现实的，什么是不现实的。路线图也是一个产品的核心。Scott McCarty 写了关于 管理开源产品路线图 的文章，以及为什么专有产品的路线图与建立在开源供应链上的产品没有什么不同。产品经理与客户交谈，对他们的需求进行排序，制定路线图，然后找出如何通过建设、购买和合作来提供能力。\n\r\n《将开源产品推向市场》\n\r\n产品营销和计划中的信息传递的作用对于一个成功的发布至关重要。Scott McCarty 继续他关于开源供应链中的产品管理的系列文章，讨论了 开源和产品营销的交叉点。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/12/open-source-software-business\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "美国一州长重申将起诉查看网站源代码的记者\n\r\n去年 10 月，一名美国记者使用浏览器自带的工具查看了美国密苏里州教育部门网站的网页源代码，发现其在网页中泄露了所有教师和管理人员的社会安全号码。他向该州政府报告了该问题，并在漏洞得到解决后才公开发布了这个事情。美国联邦调查局很早就告诉该州的官员，“这次事件并不是真正的网络入侵事件”。该州教育部门最初还写了一份新闻稿，感谢记者提醒他们注意此事。但该州州长坚持认为记者是黑客，并命令密苏里州公路巡警对他们进行“调查”，以便起诉。这一决定引来舆论大哗，但该州州长本周召开新闻发布会，重申将起诉记者，因为他们揭露了他自己的政府运行了一个危险的计算机系统，使 60 万州雇员的私人信息面临危险。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这世界就是因为这些愚蠢的官僚显现出几分滑稽。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n深度学习不可信\n\r\n过去 20 年，深度学习透过一系列商业应用逐渐主导了人工智能研究和应用。专家认为，该技术是 不可信的，因为它无法解释，而且不适用于某些应用，因为它会经历灾难性的遗忘。换言之，如果算法有效，无法理解它为什么有效。而当该工具慢慢学习新数据库时，其学习记忆的任意部分可能会突然崩塌。因此在任何攸关生死的应用（例如医疗应用）上使用深度学习都可能存在风险。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然 AI 也确实在很多领域发挥了重要作用，或具有神奇的效果，但或许我们现在对 AI 的认识还只是盲人摸象。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nCentOS Linux 8 到达生命终点\n\r\n一年前红帽公司宣布他们将重点转移到 CentOS Stream 上，作为红帽企业 Linux（RHEL）的新上游。今年以来，CentOS Stream 已经初具规模，而这意味着 CentOS Linux 8 的完结。昨天，CentOS 8 正式到达终点，不会再有对它的支持和维护。之前发布的 RHEL 8.5 以及伴随的 CentOS 8.5 将成为绝响。\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：CentOS 的落幕具有里程碑意义，我们将迎来一个没有 CentOS 的时代，这或许是好事，或许不是。",

          "description": "如果你最开始使用的是 Windows 电脑，你很可能会使用“文件夹folder”这个术语。\n\r\n但当你换到 Linux 时，你会发现文件夹通常被称为“目录directory”。\n\r\n这可能使一些新的 Linux 用户感到困惑。你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？它们有区别吗？\n\r\n事情是这样的。如果你愿意，你可以叫它文件夹，如果你喜欢，也可以叫它目录。这没有什么区别。\n\r\n但是，如果你想知道为什么文件夹在 Linux 中被称为目录，这里有一些解释。\n\r\n为什么在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录？\n\r\n在我解释之前，让我们回顾一下文件夹和目录在现实世界中的用途。\n\r\n在现实中，文件夹（封套）可以用来保存几个文件（或其他项目）。而目录则可以用来维护项目的索引，这样你就可以找到哪个项目位于哪里。\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，让我们回到目录。这个词甚至在 Linux 存在之前就已经存在了。它来自 UNIX 时代。Linux 继承了 UNIX 的很多东西，这只是其中的一个。\n\r\n现在让我告诉你一些可能让你吃惊的事情。目录并不是真的把文件放在里面。目录是一个“特殊的文件”，它知道文件在存储中的位置（通过 inode）。\n\r\n这就说明了为什么它被称为目录。目录用来保存项目的索引，而不用保存项目本身。Linux 和 UNIX 中的目录并不保存它里面的文件。它们只是记录文件位置的信息。\n\r\n如果你想了解更多关于它的信息，我这篇关于 硬链接 的文章应该可以帮助你。\n\r\n那么，为什么它被称为文件夹呢？依我看，这是视角的原因。当你在一个图形环境中时，你会将事物可视化。在这里，文件可以像页面一样被可视化，这些文件页面被存储在一个封套（文件夹）中。\n\r\n当操作系统开始使用图形元素时，我认为一些术语也相应地发生了变化，目录 -> 文件夹就是其中之一。\n\r\n你应该叫它文件夹还是目录？\n\r\n这完全取决于你。你可以按你的习惯使用这两个术语。\n\r\n然而，如果你正在学习 Linux 命令行或经常使用它，使用目录这个术语可能会有一点帮助。\n\r\n有一些 Linux 命令，如 mkdir、rmdir 等，术语 “dir” 给出了一个提示，即这些命令与目录有关。\n\r\n同样，许多 Linux 命令和 bash 脚本会使用选项 -d 表示目录，-f 表示文件。\n\r\n甚至终端中的文件属性也会通过在目录前面加上字母 “d” 来区分文件和文件夹（目录）。\n\r\n拿这个例子来说，我有一个名为 some 的文件和一个名为 something 的文件夹/目录。请注意各种 Linux 命令是如何用 “dir” 或 “d” 来区分文件和目录的。\n\r\n\n\r\n所有这些让我觉得，在使用 Linux 命令时，使用 “目录” 这个术语会有好处。你的潜意识会更容易将 “dir” 和 “d” 与目录联系起来。\n\r\n再说一次，你想叫它文件夹或目录这完全取决于你。人们会明白你指的是什么。\n\r\n我刚刚对目录一词的历史渊源做了一些分析，这应该会给你一些提示，为什么人们说 “在 Linux/UNIX 中，所有东西都是一个文件”。\n\r\n现在我结束了我的胡言乱语，我请你对它进行评论。如果你发现任何技术上的不准确之处，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/folder-directory-linux/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lujun9972 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "除了 System76 宣布了基于 RUST 的新桌面环境之外，还有别的团队也给桌面 Linux 用户带来了一些新东西。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n过去的几年里，我们很欣慰地看到 Nitrux Linux 背后的团队正在扩大他们对 Linux 社区的影响。如今，伴随着全新 Maui Shell 的发布，他们的影响也已经得到了进一步扩大。\n\r\n让我们一起来看看吧！\n\r\n关于 Maui 项目的一些背景介绍\n\r\n\n\r\n作为由 Nitrux Linux 团队原班人马创建、开发、维护的项目，Maui 项目已经开发了许多基础应用。实际上，他们的文件管理器 Index 甚至成功进入了我们的 2021 年五大应用列表 之中！\n\r\n他们的所有应用均使用 MauiKit 这款定制框架开发。基于 Kirigami 的 MauiKit 专注于跨终端融合性，因此开发出来的应用可以在电脑和手机端拥有一致的体验。此外，它为开发者提供了更多的预置组件，因此创建应用可以更加便捷。\n\r\n目前 Maui 项目开发的部分应用包括：\n\r\n\r\nIndex（文件管理器）\n\r\nNota（文本编辑器）\n\r\nVVave（音乐播放器）\n\r\nClip（视频播放器）\n\r\nPix（图片查看器）\n\r\n\r\n虽然这些自制应用本身质量不错，但它们在 Nitrux Linux 的默认桌面环境 KDE Plasma 里总显得不合群。因此，Maui Shell 应运而生。\n\r\nMaui Shell 介绍\n\r\n\n\r\n借助与 Maui 应用相同的 MauiKit 和 Qt 技术底层，Maui Shell 是 Nitrux 在桌面环境领域的一个新尝试。从上面的截图可以看出，它在很大程度上受到了 GNOME Shell 的启发，这在使用过程中也确实有所体现。\n\r\n但，这并不意味着 Maui Shell 没有原创的地方。从底部上滑可打开类似于 GNOME “活动”的概览界面。与此相邻的是一个小 Dock，可以通过相当美观的启动器来启动应用。右上角有一个与 macOS 相似的控制中心，内有精心设计的菜单和许多控制功能。\n\r\n在我使用它的过程中，一切都是如此精致、自然。我感觉这与它极致现代、扁平的设计美学有关，我甚至认为 Maui Shell 已经超越了 GNOME 和 KDE Plasma 等同类软件。说到 Plasma，与 Nitrux 的默认 Plasma 版本相比，Maui Shell 在低端设备（和虚拟机）上的反应更加灵敏。\n\r\n总的来说，我预测 Maui Shell 将依靠其实用性成为 “Linux 桌面环境之王”。然而，我还没谈到 Maui Shell 最核心的特性：跨终端自适应性Convergence。\n\r\n主流之中的融合\n\r\n许多人可能还记得 2010 年 Canonical 开发了一款类似的跨终端桌面环境 Unity，它最终以失败落幕，到 2018 年则被完全淘汰了。但是，Unity 和 Maui Shell 有一个共同特性 —— 那就是跨终端融合性。\n\r\n随着 Linux 在移动端的开发力度逐渐加大，跨终端支持变得尤为重要。由此来看，一个新的桌面环境竟能同时支持桌面端和移动端，的确不可思议。\n\r\n这一点必须依靠大量的跨终端应用实现，而 Maui 已经处在了完美的衔接点上。这仅仅是我相信 Maui Shell 能成为 Linux 桌面未来的原因之一。\n\r\n立即试用 Maui Shell\n\r\n与其他新发布的软件不同，Maui Shell 已经预装于新发布的 Nitrux 1.8。如果你想亲自尝试一下，那请随时从下方链接中获取 ISO 镜像。但是，在尝试之前，请务必知晓：Maui Shell 仍处于早期开发阶段。\n\r\n尽管 Maui Shell 拥有许多特色功能，但部分功能可能存在问题、尚未实现，要么就是缺失了，其中包括：\n\r\n\r\n蓝牙支持\n\r\nPulseAudio 支持\n\r\n网络开关\n\r\n媒体控制（MPRIs）\n\r\n拖放支持\n\r\n多显示器支持\n\r\n设置应用\n\r\nXWayland Shell 插件\n\r\n\r\n因此，我暂时不能建议你使用 Maui Shell 作为主力桌面环境。为此，你可能需要等待 2022 年秋季发布的正式版本。\n\r\n在此之前，我仍将持续关注 Maui Shell。对于这款桌面环境，你的评价如何？欢迎在评论区说出你的想法！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/maui-shell-unveiled/\n\r\n作者：Jacob Crume 选题：lujun9972 译者：imgradeone 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",
